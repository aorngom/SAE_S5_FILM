1
00:00:00,569 --> 00:00:02,007
Previously on Ugly Betty...

2
00:00:02,057 --> 00:00:03,749
What was your first
impression of me ?

3
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:07,842
- What is is?
- A tracking device.

4
00:00:07,892 --> 00:00:11,241
I will know where you are
every minute of every day.

5
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:14,239
I can't...
spend time with you and your girlfriend.

6
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:15,356
What does that make us?

7
00:00:15,406 --> 00:00:17,575
Two people who work
in the same building.

8
00:00:18,257 --> 00:00:20,561
Your family is falling apart.
Do you realize that?

9
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:22,708
My family is coming together.

10
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:25,480
He said if I went throug with
the surgery, I'd lose everything.

11
00:00:25,534 --> 00:00:27,181
He said he'd rather
I were dead.

12
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:28,838
You're here because of me,

13
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:30,909
because of what I did.

14
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:33,162
I'm turning myself in.

15
00:00:35,298 --> 00:00:37,742
I'm reporting live outside
of Meade Publications,

16
00:00:37,795 --> 00:00:40,632
where Bradford Meade is expected
to return to work tomorrow

17
00:00:40,686 --> 00:00:42,692
after his release from prison.

18
00:00:42,748 --> 00:00:44,562
Arrested for the
murder of Fey Sommers,

19
00:00:44,618 --> 00:00:47,842
all charges against him were dropped
after his wife, Claire Meade,

20
00:00:47,897 --> 00:00:50,550
turned herself in to
authorities late last night.

21
00:00:50,605 --> 00:00:53,423
And now let's get some reactions
from some of the employees.

22
00:00:53,475 --> 00:00:55,112
Uh, excuse me, miss. Miss--

23
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,192
No comment. No comment!

24
00:00:57,976 --> 00:00:58,981
Ow.

25
00:01:01,946 --> 00:01:04,840
No comment. No comment! Ow.

26
00:01:09,065 --> 00:01:10,062
Ow.

27
00:01:12,745 --> 00:01:13,672
Ow.

28
00:01:15,238 --> 00:01:16,172
Ow.

29
00:01:17,376 --> 00:01:18,393
- Ow.
- Hilda.

30
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:20,050
- Justin!
- I'm sorry.

31
00:01:20,107 --> 00:01:21,882
It just gets
funnier every time.

32
00:01:21,936 --> 00:01:23,700
Would you just go get
ready for school, please?

33
00:01:23,738 --> 00:01:24,853
Fine.

34
00:01:28,075 --> 00:01:30,300
So how you doing, anyway?

35
00:01:30,568 --> 00:01:32,180
And don't say "no comment."

36
00:01:32,628 --> 00:01:33,801
I don't know.

37
00:01:34,516 --> 00:01:37,891
Ever since Ms. Meade's arrest,
I just can't help but feel guilty.

38
00:01:38,248 --> 00:01:40,812
I was the one who talked
her into turning herself in.

39
00:01:40,865 --> 00:01:42,942
Hey, you didn't talk
her into anything.

40
00:01:42,996 --> 00:01:45,153
She did what she
felt she had to do.

41
00:01:45,517 --> 00:01:47,052
How's Daniel handling this?

42
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:48,522
He and Alexis aren't speaking.

43
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:50,312
Alexis and his father
aren't speaking,

44
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:54,150
an his mother is in the hospital being
detoxed before she can be arraigned.

45
00:01:54,207 --> 00:01:57,823
You see? It really makes you appreciate
coming from a nice, normal family.

46
00:01:59,395 --> 00:02:02,331
Papi, what part of "house
arrest" don't you understand?

47
00:02:02,385 --> 00:02:04,900
I just went out 2 feet
to get the paper.

48
00:02:06,256 --> 00:02:07,691
I think that's for you.

49
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:10,913
Yes, Constance.

50
00:02:12,157 --> 00:02:13,790
I just stepped
out my front door.

51
00:02:13,848 --> 00:02:15,522
I wasn't fleeing the country.

52
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:18,541
Okay, okay.
I'm back inside now. Happy?

53
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,600
Dad, it's only four more
weeks till your court date.

54
00:02:22,658 --> 00:02:24,732
I can't live like a prisoner
for four more weeks!

55
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:26,813
I'm going stir crazy in here!

56
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:30,003
I'm starting not to remember
the--the feel of rain,

57
00:02:30,065 --> 00:02:32,753
the smell of
freshly mowed grass.

58
00:02:32,808 --> 00:02:34,972
Papi, we live in
Jackson Heights.

59
00:02:35,026 --> 00:02:37,172
The grass smells
like fried onions.

60
00:02:39,088 --> 00:02:42,370
I got the message, and I'll definitely
be there at 9:00 on the dot.

61
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,631
I waited an hour and
a half to do that.

62
00:02:45,685 --> 00:02:49,573
I just...
I came to get my things before...

63
00:02:49,987 --> 00:02:51,193
I'll come back later.

64
00:02:51,246 --> 00:02:53,220
No, no, no.

65
00:02:53,275 --> 00:02:57,171
We still haven't had our beautiful
father-son reconciliation.

66
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:59,931
Last time I saw you,
things were so rushed,

67
00:03:00,068 --> 00:03:02,300
what with you having
me arrested and all.

68
00:03:03,056 --> 00:03:08,070
So... this is the life
you wanted so badly.

69
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:11,470
Actually, in the life I wanted,
you were behind bars.

70
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,551
And in the life I wanted,
you were still a man.

71
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:17,782
You remember making me this?

72
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,711
You were 6.

73
00:03:19,985 --> 00:03:21,643
After you disappeared,

74
00:03:21,698 --> 00:03:24,682
I'd look at it to remind myself
of the son that I'd lost.

75
00:03:24,735 --> 00:03:27,753
Now it reminds me of the
son I wish I'd never had.

76
00:03:31,697 --> 00:03:34,351
You and I... we're finished.

77
00:03:34,405 --> 00:03:37,540
We were finished
a long time ago.

78
00:03:42,298 --> 00:03:45,392
Hey, I've been looking for you.
Look what I just scored.

79
00:03:45,446 --> 00:03:48,340
New Prada store's opening tonight,
and Steve Aoki's deejaying.

80
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:49,471
Meet up for drinks beforehand?

81
00:03:49,508 --> 00:03:50,933
Oh, I can't. I have plans.

82
00:03:50,985 --> 00:03:52,241
- Who is he?
- My mother.

83
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,640
She's in town for another
one of her stupid cat shows.

84
00:03:54,695 --> 00:03:57,730
It's disgusting--her and a
bunch of fancy pussycats.

85
00:03:57,785 --> 00:03:59,630
Well, don't worry.
I'll skip Prada.

86
00:03:59,685 --> 00:04:01,733
Your girlfriend is
reporting for duty.

87
00:04:01,786 --> 00:04:03,150
So where are the three
of us going to dinner?

88
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:05,142
Actually, you're not coming.

89
00:04:05,195 --> 00:04:06,171
What?

90
00:04:06,226 --> 00:04:07,722
But it's your mother.

91
00:04:07,776 --> 00:04:09,402
I'm the love of your
life, remember?

92
00:04:09,455 --> 00:04:11,471
You are officially
released from beard duty.

93
00:04:11,527 --> 00:04:13,001
Consider yourself shaved.

94
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:14,580
Wait, what are you saying?

95
00:04:14,637 --> 00:04:17,851
Did you actually tell your
mother that you are a ho--

96
00:04:17,908 --> 00:04:19,750
No. It's just...

97
00:04:19,808 --> 00:04:22,262
I've been telling her you were my
girlfriend for a few years now and...

98
00:04:22,297 --> 00:04:25,321
she's starting to pressure
me to buy the cow.

99
00:04:25,376 --> 00:04:28,170
So you're saying we're over...
and I'm fat?

100
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,482
No, just over.

101
00:04:30,535 --> 00:04:31,963
Just like that?

102
00:04:32,307 --> 00:04:35,783
Sweetie, it's not you. It's me.

103
00:04:35,837 --> 00:04:38,151
Oh, you are damn
right that it's you.

104
00:04:38,207 --> 00:04:40,850
I am the best pretend
girlfriend you'll ever have.

105
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:42,261
Mandy...

106
00:04:42,627 --> 00:04:45,362
We'll always have that
fake pregnancy scare.

107
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:49,603
Oh, that was a real scare, you idiot.
It just wasn't yours.

108
00:04:58,245 --> 00:04:59,561
How are you feeling?

109
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:02,400
Well, I've had
better mondays...

110
00:05:02,715 --> 00:05:05,033
and better jewelry.

111
00:05:06,748 --> 00:05:09,212
The shakes haven't
started yet, but...

112
00:05:09,516 --> 00:05:12,150
the sweating and the
nightmares are a delight.

113
00:05:12,206 --> 00:05:15,322
Oh, and they say I should
be moving to the prison

114
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:17,080
by the end of the week.

115
00:05:17,537 --> 00:05:19,543
You should have let
me stay in there.

116
00:05:21,116 --> 00:05:22,473
I'm scared.

117
00:05:23,455 --> 00:05:24,871
I'm here for you.

118
00:05:26,796 --> 00:05:28,542
I hope you still are

119
00:05:29,048 --> 00:05:31,052
- after...
- After what?

120
00:05:31,907 --> 00:05:33,652
Hey. How are you feeling?

121
00:05:35,957 --> 00:05:38,631
I've been talking with the new lawyers, and
they seem to think if we go with insanity--

122
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,391
That's not why I
called you here.

123
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,291
What's going on?

124
00:05:42,347 --> 00:05:44,923
Your father tried to
fire Alexis today.

125
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:46,772
Tried? I did.

126
00:05:46,827 --> 00:05:47,831
But you can't.

127
00:05:47,887 --> 00:05:50,733
She's your child,
and she's your sister.

128
00:05:51,108 --> 00:05:54,282
Now I'm probably going
away for a very long time,

129
00:05:54,827 --> 00:05:56,573
and I want you all
to be a family.

130
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:59,401
I don't think Alex wants to
be part of any family, mom.

131
00:05:59,457 --> 00:06:00,901
Alexis,

132
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:04,672
and she'll never be part of a family
if you keep pushing her away,

133
00:06:05,726 --> 00:06:08,842
which is why I've convinced
her to help you run "Mode."

134
00:06:08,898 --> 00:06:11,292
- Is she on morphine?
- I wish.

135
00:06:11,346 --> 00:06:14,770
Don't be ridiculous, Claire.
I decide who works for my companies.

136
00:06:14,826 --> 00:06:15,942
I own "Mode."

137
00:06:15,997 --> 00:06:19,851
Actually, dear,
you own Meade Publications.

138
00:06:19,907 --> 00:06:21,930
Apparently you've forgotten...

139
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:23,843
I own "Mode."

140
00:06:27,138 --> 00:06:29,032
Your mother owns this magazine?

141
00:06:29,086 --> 00:06:29,882
Since when?

142
00:06:29,935 --> 00:06:33,061
Since my dad needed a tax shelter,
and he put it in her name.

143
00:06:33,116 --> 00:06:36,020
So now she insists Alex
and be co-editors-in-chief.

144
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,121
There's not anything
anyone can do about it.

145
00:06:38,173 --> 00:06:39,708
Maybe that's not
such a bad thing.

146
00:06:39,751 --> 00:06:42,059
I mean, you and Alexis can
get to know each other again.

147
00:06:42,109 --> 00:06:44,563
And now you only have
to do half the work.

148
00:06:44,828 --> 00:06:45,802
Half?

149
00:06:45,858 --> 00:06:47,741
Betty, there's no
half with Alex.

150
00:06:47,797 --> 00:06:49,811
You put us side by side in anything,
doesn't matter what,

151
00:06:49,848 --> 00:06:51,780
she always has to win.

152
00:06:52,556 --> 00:06:55,772
Even when we went jogging every morning.
It would be all great,

153
00:06:55,827 --> 00:07:00,373
but then, at the very end, every time,
he always had to pull ahead,

154
00:07:00,475 --> 00:07:02,443
just to remind me he could.

155
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,070
Yes!

156
00:07:09,655 --> 00:07:13,221
Daniel, you've done a great job running
this magazine for the last six months.

157
00:07:13,276 --> 00:07:14,912
I know you can win this race.

158
00:07:14,965 --> 00:07:16,551
It's like the tortoise
and the hare--

159
00:07:16,605 --> 00:07:18,693
Okay, okay.
I'm gonna figure it out.

160
00:07:18,747 --> 00:07:21,513
You can cross my pep talk
off your list today.

161
00:07:22,305 --> 00:07:23,701
There will be more.

162
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:29,931
So both of you
are editors-in-chief.

163
00:07:29,985 --> 00:07:32,032
Alexis is an editor-in-chief.

164
00:07:32,097 --> 00:07:34,433
Daniel is an editor-in-chief.

165
00:07:34,878 --> 00:07:38,360
Seems like practically everyone in
the room is an editor-in-chief...

166
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:39,920
except for me.

167
00:07:40,007 --> 00:07:41,333
And me.

168
00:07:42,178 --> 00:07:44,900
Okay. Here's how we're gonna
split up responsibilities.

169
00:07:44,956 --> 00:07:48,103
Obviously, Wilhelmina,
you are still creative director.

170
00:07:48,156 --> 00:07:51,822
I'll continue to write the letter from
the editor and have final say on the book.

171
00:07:51,877 --> 00:07:54,282
Wow. Look at the
big man in charge.

172
00:07:54,337 --> 00:07:55,381
Somebody has to be.

173
00:07:55,438 --> 00:07:58,712
Not all of us have time to fake our
own death, disappear for two years.

174
00:07:58,765 --> 00:08:01,560
Oh, god.
Are you still singing that old song?

175
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:04,561
Daniel, you can be the boss
of everything for all I care.

176
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:08,262
I don't want anything to do with you,
dad or this magazine.

177
00:08:08,318 --> 00:08:09,360
Really?

178
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:12,442
'Cause that's not what you told mom,
is it?

179
00:08:12,496 --> 00:08:14,612
Just stop, Daniel. I'm done.

180
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,501
Have fun with your
little magazine.

181
00:08:16,555 --> 00:08:18,671
I for one have much
bigger dreams.

182
00:08:18,726 --> 00:08:20,721
Like what? A uterus?

183
00:08:20,778 --> 00:08:22,490
You can say it,
but can you spell it?

184
00:08:22,547 --> 00:08:24,343
Do I need to be
in this meeting?

185
00:08:25,395 --> 00:08:27,013
This meeting's over.

186
00:08:29,087 --> 00:08:33,682
Well, they really did take your balls
away with that operation, didn't they?

187
00:08:33,737 --> 00:08:36,171
- Excuse me?
- What is wrong with you?

188
00:08:36,227 --> 00:08:38,863
You're giving Bradford
exactly what he wants.

189
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:40,420
He won. Game over.

190
00:08:40,475 --> 00:08:42,023
Not necessarily.

191
00:08:42,077 --> 00:08:45,383
Bradford doesn't want you anywhere
near this magazine, right?

192
00:08:45,435 --> 00:08:48,723
So splash yourself all over it.

193
00:08:48,776 --> 00:08:51,413
Your father will die of shame.

194
00:08:51,468 --> 00:08:53,180
He wouldn't die.

195
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,343
A stroke, maybe.

196
00:08:55,397 --> 00:08:57,220
Alexis, make "Mode" your own.

197
00:08:57,277 --> 00:08:58,750
You approve the book.

198
00:08:58,807 --> 00:09:00,612
You write the letter
from the editor.

199
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,402
Show the industry and your
father just who's in charge.

200
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:05,200
You mean take it
away from Daniel?

201
00:09:05,257 --> 00:09:06,700
Do you care?

202
00:09:06,865 --> 00:09:08,212
Not really.

203
00:09:08,265 --> 00:09:10,013
Ah, well.

204
00:09:10,157 --> 00:09:12,523
If you really
wanna do this job,

205
00:09:12,577 --> 00:09:15,060
you should have an
appropriate office...

206
00:09:15,798 --> 00:09:17,081
like this one.

207
00:09:25,277 --> 00:09:26,943
This is our new office?

208
00:09:26,995 --> 00:09:28,080
It has fluorescent lighting.

209
00:09:28,118 --> 00:09:30,293
I will not be looked at
under this merciless glare.

210
00:09:30,345 --> 00:09:33,901
Oh, patience, Blanche.
It's only temporary.

211
00:09:33,956 --> 00:09:36,921
The minute Daniel sees
her as a real threat,

212
00:09:36,978 --> 00:09:38,401
they'll be at each
other's throats,

213
00:09:38,457 --> 00:09:40,962
and then I'll have my pick
of any office I want.

214
00:09:41,018 --> 00:09:42,411
Oh, thank god.
You have a new plan.

215
00:09:42,447 --> 00:09:44,621
We shall overcome, girlfriend.

216
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,451
You did not just say that.

217
00:09:49,117 --> 00:09:51,010
Oh, my god. Mommy...

218
00:09:51,188 --> 00:09:52,553
in the building.

219
00:10:08,895 --> 00:10:10,543
Hello, Amanda.

220
00:10:10,596 --> 00:10:12,540
Hi, mama Weiner.

221
00:10:13,377 --> 00:10:14,871
Dear, I hate to be rude,

222
00:10:14,927 --> 00:10:16,931
but now that you've broken
my little Marc's heart

223
00:10:16,988 --> 00:10:18,842
with--shall we say,
your indiscretions--

224
00:10:18,896 --> 00:10:21,491
I think you should go
back to Mrs. Weiner.

225
00:10:21,547 --> 00:10:22,503
Indiscretions?

226
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:24,530
Marc told me about
the other men...

227
00:10:24,688 --> 00:10:25,920
and women.

228
00:10:25,977 --> 00:10:28,443
Drug addiction makes
you do strange things.

229
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,502
But Marc says you're
working on that.

230
00:10:30,557 --> 00:10:32,972
One day at a time.

231
00:10:33,027 --> 00:10:34,223
Really?

232
00:10:34,648 --> 00:10:37,252
Marc told you all of that,
did he?

233
00:10:37,308 --> 00:10:38,280
Mom!

234
00:10:38,335 --> 00:10:40,863
There's my Marc-y boy!

235
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:42,122
Hi!

236
00:10:44,256 --> 00:10:46,872
I thought you were going to the cat
show, and then we were going to dinner.

237
00:10:46,908 --> 00:10:48,672
Sweetie, I had a cat-tastrophe.

238
00:10:48,728 --> 00:10:51,860
Lady Buttons of Camelot
lost a jewel on her collar.

239
00:10:51,915 --> 00:10:54,323
That's a 10-point
penalty for appearance.

240
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,902
Can you have one of your
fashion people here fix it?

241
00:10:56,955 --> 00:10:58,381
Oh, of course.

242
00:10:58,505 --> 00:11:00,713
Um, fashion person. Help!

243
00:11:00,765 --> 00:11:02,471
I would be happy to.

244
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:05,911
I just hope my drug and sex
addictions don't get in the way.

245
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:09,572
Oh, mom... why don't you go down to
the cafeteria and get some lunch,

246
00:11:09,626 --> 00:11:11,363
and I'll bring
the collar to you?

247
00:11:11,415 --> 00:11:14,970
Wait, Marc. Aren't you gonna introduce
your mom to your new lady love?

248
00:11:15,025 --> 00:11:18,141
The one in whose bosom you found
comfort after dating a skank like me?

249
00:11:18,195 --> 00:11:20,330
You're dating someone new?

250
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,083
Oh, look, and here she is.

251
00:11:23,135 --> 00:11:26,251
This is Marc's new
girlfriend, Betty.

252
00:11:26,457 --> 00:11:28,052
Girlfriend?

253
00:11:28,476 --> 00:11:30,313
That's a good one, Amanda.

254
00:11:30,445 --> 00:11:32,163
Well, what's so funny?

255
00:11:32,215 --> 00:11:35,040
Well, you know, 'cause Marc's--

www.forom.com

259
00:11:56,206 --> 00:11:58,240
You haven't told
your mom you're gay?

260
00:11:59,015 --> 00:12:01,082
I mean, isn't it a little...

261
00:12:01,716 --> 00:12:05,463
I don't know, I--just--
just that you're so... sparkly!

262
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:08,333
She visits twice a year.
She sees what she wants to see.

263
00:12:08,506 --> 00:12:10,103
I can't believe
I'm asking you is.

264
00:12:10,155 --> 00:12:11,462
I need your help.

265
00:12:11,726 --> 00:12:14,421
You need my help?

266
00:12:15,446 --> 00:12:17,811
The girl you've tortured
for the last six months?

267
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:20,180
I think "tortured"
is a little severe.

268
00:12:20,238 --> 00:12:22,340
Well, my second day here,
you tricked me into eating glue

269
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,801
by telling me it
was white chocolate.

270
00:12:23,837 --> 00:12:25,242
No! I could've died.

271
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:27,731
Oh, I only let you eat two pieces.
Come on, Betty!

272
00:12:27,786 --> 00:12:30,150
It would really mean
a lot to my mother.

273
00:12:32,026 --> 00:12:35,840
I think Lady Buttons of Camelot has a
real shot in the progression ring today.

274
00:12:35,896 --> 00:12:38,472
Look at her.
She's having a really good fur day.

275
00:12:38,528 --> 00:12:40,431
Okay, I'm not dating
your kid anymore,

276
00:12:40,486 --> 00:12:42,750
so I don't have to listen
to all the cat chat.

277
00:12:42,807 --> 00:12:43,801
Marc's right.

278
00:12:43,858 --> 00:12:46,432
You are cranky when
you don't get your fix.

279
00:12:51,798 --> 00:12:54,142
Oh, look at this.

280
00:12:54,197 --> 00:12:55,933
It's Betty's papi.

281
00:12:55,986 --> 00:12:57,580
You should really talk to him.

282
00:12:57,636 --> 00:12:58,942
Won't Betty mind?

283
00:12:58,997 --> 00:13:02,280
She hasn't found the right time to even
tell her father she's dating Marc.

284
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,443
You could really help them out.

285
00:13:06,128 --> 00:13:08,622
Hi. This is Jean Weiner.

286
00:13:09,015 --> 00:13:11,461
All you have to do is come
stand next to me for two minutes

287
00:13:11,515 --> 00:13:14,533
and let me tell my mom
that we're... dating.

288
00:13:14,588 --> 00:13:16,392
It's crazy.
She would never even believe us.

289
00:13:16,448 --> 00:13:17,753
Okay, okay, okay.

290
00:13:17,805 --> 00:13:19,110
If you do this for me,

291
00:13:20,105 --> 00:13:22,670
I'll give you information
that'll help save your boss' job.

292
00:13:22,727 --> 00:13:25,283
What? Why? What do you know?

293
00:13:25,656 --> 00:13:26,770
You help me first.

294
00:13:28,928 --> 00:13:31,640
So how's the happy couple?

295
00:13:31,695 --> 00:13:34,690
Oh, laugh, clown, laugh.

296
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:38,632
But I am showing everyone copies
of your "modeling" photos.

297
00:13:38,688 --> 00:13:40,361
Okay, those were tasteful,

298
00:13:40,618 --> 00:13:42,382
and he told me he loved me.

299
00:13:42,437 --> 00:13:45,323
Besides, you're not gonna have
time to show anyone anything.

300
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:47,680
Your mom just talked
to Betty's dad.

301
00:13:47,736 --> 00:13:48,580
She what?

302
00:13:48,638 --> 00:13:51,850
And you're all having dinner
tonight at the casa de Suarez.

303
00:13:52,758 --> 00:13:53,862
Ta!

304
00:13:54,335 --> 00:13:56,341
This better be some
good information, Marc.

305
00:13:56,398 --> 00:13:58,392
You're ruining meat loaf night.

306
00:13:59,187 --> 00:14:00,411
Wait. What?

307
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,723
Alexis wants to take over
the company and push you out.

308
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:04,853
That's what Marc said.

309
00:14:04,906 --> 00:14:06,210
Is Alex in his office?

310
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:07,702
Yes, she is.

311
00:14:07,757 --> 00:14:10,553
Why would Marc tell you something like
that? Didn't he make you eat glue?

312
00:14:10,585 --> 00:14:12,743
Yeah, that was before.
I'm his girlfriend now.

313
00:14:12,797 --> 00:14:14,103
His what?

314
00:14:14,157 --> 00:14:15,943
The things I do for you.

315
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,703
Daniel Meade.

316
00:14:19,756 --> 00:14:21,960
Nick Pepper,
Ms. Meade's new assistant.

317
00:14:22,957 --> 00:14:26,221
I have been following your career
since I graduated from Cornell.

318
00:14:26,277 --> 00:14:28,050
I wanna be you in five years.

319
00:14:28,177 --> 00:14:29,862
Buy more expensive ties...

320
00:14:29,918 --> 00:14:32,232
sleep with a few models--
you're halfway there, buddy.

321
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:33,610
Yes!

322
00:14:35,095 --> 00:14:38,653
So... new office.
New assistant.

323
00:14:38,705 --> 00:14:41,501
That what you mean by "I don't want
a thing to do with this magazine"?

324
00:14:41,608 --> 00:14:43,391
Oh, calm down, Daniel.

325
00:14:43,446 --> 00:14:46,072
I've been thinking about
what you said and...

326
00:14:46,705 --> 00:14:48,751
I just can't lie to mom again.

327
00:14:48,807 --> 00:14:52,511
So if us working together makes her happy,
then I think we should give it a try.

328
00:14:52,566 --> 00:14:54,322
I'll even follow your lead.

329
00:14:54,378 --> 00:14:58,552
And Lucy's actually gonna let Charlie
Brown kick the football this time, right?

330
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:00,390
You're not fooling me, Alexis.

331
00:15:00,446 --> 00:15:02,382
I'm not the kid brother
you used to push around.

332
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:05,311
And I'm not your big
brother anymore, clearly.

333
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:08,230
Look, can we not
make this about us?

334
00:15:08,288 --> 00:15:10,062
This is about mom.

335
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,902
If I agree,

336
00:15:13,365 --> 00:15:15,931
that wouldn't mean I'm
working for you. Understood?

337
00:15:15,985 --> 00:15:18,353
I know. 50-50.

338
00:15:18,658 --> 00:15:20,321
You want me to inkie-swear?

339
00:15:20,928 --> 00:15:22,651
Okay, so what can I do?

340
00:15:22,975 --> 00:15:26,811
Well, this issue is pretty
much put to bed, so...

341
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:29,843
I haven't written a letter
from the editor yet.

342
00:15:30,117 --> 00:15:32,091
Maybe you can write one, too.

343
00:15:32,338 --> 00:15:34,802
I'll print 'em side by side.
How about that?

344
00:15:34,856 --> 00:15:36,150
Side by side?

345
00:15:36,207 --> 00:15:38,801
Yes, Alex. It's called sharing.

346
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,893
You mean like Katie Meyers?

347
00:15:40,946 --> 00:15:44,832
Uh, that wasn't so much sharing
as you stealing my girlfriend.

348
00:15:44,886 --> 00:15:46,340
Okay. Bad example.

349
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:49,093
I need 400 words by
tomorrow morning.

350
00:15:49,178 --> 00:15:51,760
We take the book
to press by noon.

351
00:15:56,358 --> 00:15:57,582
Nick!

352
00:16:00,415 --> 00:16:04,353
Cancel your paintball game or
whatever it is you do after work.

353
00:16:04,408 --> 00:16:07,642
We've got a lot to do if we're gonna
get this to the printer's by midnight.

354
00:16:07,996 --> 00:16:09,892
Didn't Daniel say "noon"?

355
00:16:09,947 --> 00:16:13,763
Daniel also thinks I'm gonna
be sharing this job 50-50.

356
00:16:13,817 --> 00:16:15,073
You're not?

357
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,750
Honey, I didn't
share Katie Meyers,

358
00:16:17,807 --> 00:16:20,233
and I'm not gonna
share this magazine.

359
00:16:20,288 --> 00:16:22,622
There's my issue,
and there's Daniel's.

360
00:16:22,675 --> 00:16:25,391
And Daniel's is never
gonna see the light of day.

361
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:27,742
Dude, you're awesome.

362
00:16:27,797 --> 00:16:31,091
Dude, you haven't
seen anything yet.

363
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:35,172
Okay, we gotta focus.

364
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:36,721
We gotta sit through an
entire dinner with my mother.

365
00:16:36,757 --> 00:16:38,393
We have to know everything there
is to know about each other.

366
00:16:38,428 --> 00:16:40,272
Now you're from the
Philippines, right?

367
00:16:40,327 --> 00:16:41,221
Queens.

368
00:16:41,276 --> 00:16:43,560
Don't give me that look.
They both end in "eens."

369
00:16:43,618 --> 00:16:47,450
Okay, so,
we met when I made a bet with my friends

370
00:16:47,505 --> 00:16:50,443
that I could turn you from an ugly
duckling into a beautiful swan.

371
00:16:50,495 --> 00:16:51,991
Marc, that's "she's all that."

372
00:16:52,047 --> 00:16:54,780
No, in that movie,
she actually became beautiful.

373
00:16:54,837 --> 00:16:57,883
I feel in love with you because
of that whole inner beauty crap.

374
00:16:57,937 --> 00:16:59,992
Okay. Let's move to
the flash cards.

375
00:17:00,555 --> 00:17:01,820
I hope you studied.

376
00:17:03,328 --> 00:17:04,983
What's my favorite boy band?

377
00:17:05,037 --> 00:17:06,451
- 'Nsync.
- Ding.

378
00:17:06,505 --> 00:17:07,920
What's my favorite musical?"

379
00:17:07,978 --> 00:17:09,303
- "High school musical"!
- Ding!

380
00:17:09,357 --> 00:17:10,752
Where do I get my mystic tan?

381
00:17:10,807 --> 00:17:12,802
- Sunset tan on 48th!
- Ding! Ding! Ding!

382
00:17:12,855 --> 00:17:15,502
Marc, are these really the answers that are
gonna convince your mother you're straight?

383
00:17:15,537 --> 00:17:17,903
Uh, straight guys mystic tan.
Hello? Tom Cruise.

384
00:17:17,957 --> 00:17:19,291
Okay, now you go.

385
00:17:19,525 --> 00:17:21,923
- Who's Justin?
- Uh, uh, pass.

386
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:23,211
He's my nephew. You've met him.

387
00:17:23,228 --> 00:17:25,620
Pass! Pass!
I'll never remember that. Go. Next.

388
00:17:25,676 --> 00:17:27,010
- How old am I?
- 32.

389
00:17:27,068 --> 00:17:28,190
- 22.
- Really?

390
00:17:28,245 --> 00:17:30,133
Yes! Thank you for that.

391
00:17:30,186 --> 00:17:33,502
- My favorite flowers?
- Uh... pink gerber daisies.

392
00:17:34,308 --> 00:17:36,710
Henry! Hi.

393
00:17:36,768 --> 00:17:38,703
Just dropping off paychecks.

394
00:17:39,638 --> 00:17:40,993
How have you been?

395
00:17:41,086 --> 00:17:42,770
Good. Good.

396
00:17:42,825 --> 00:17:44,111
How's Charlie?

397
00:17:44,168 --> 00:17:45,893
Good. She's good.

398
00:17:45,948 --> 00:17:47,852
Okay! Okay, Betty.
We gotta finish this.

399
00:17:47,906 --> 00:17:51,012
Um, uh, okay.
Uh, favorite pizza toppings?

400
00:17:51,066 --> 00:17:52,132
Goat cheese and capers!

401
00:17:52,186 --> 00:17:53,212
Pepperoni and mushroom.

402
00:17:53,265 --> 00:17:55,981
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Whose girlfriend is she? Beat it!

403
00:17:56,036 --> 00:17:58,490
I'm sorry.
I'm just helping him with something.

404
00:17:58,587 --> 00:18:01,153
Well, it was nice seeing you.

405
00:18:01,555 --> 00:18:02,631
Yeah.

406
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,771
- Uh, favorite Disney princess?
- Oh, Mulan.

407
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:09,171
Cinderella.

408
00:18:09,226 --> 00:18:11,682
Her mother always read
that to her before bed.

409
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,091
Okay, I think you've got it.

410
00:18:45,147 --> 00:18:47,773
Now print up those proofs and
get 'em to graphics A.S.A.P.

411
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,723
We have a midnight deadline, people.
Come on, let's move!

412
00:18:50,848 --> 00:18:53,642
I see someone's
enjoying her new role.

413
00:18:53,696 --> 00:18:56,141
Love what you did
with the office.

414
00:18:56,995 --> 00:19:00,541
And I read your letter for
the magazine--brilliant.

415
00:19:00,615 --> 00:19:02,732
A scathing indictment
of dear old dad.

416
00:19:02,787 --> 00:19:04,973
And you're looking
at the new cover.

417
00:19:05,025 --> 00:19:06,273
Think daddy'll like it?

418
00:19:06,328 --> 00:19:07,520
He is a breast man.

419
00:19:07,575 --> 00:19:09,721
Just don't know whether
he'll like them on his son.

420
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:10,721
Perfect.

421
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:14,952
Is it, uh, safe to assume that
Daniel is not aware of any of this?

422
00:19:15,006 --> 00:19:16,040
Oh, please.

423
00:19:16,096 --> 00:19:17,422
Daniel's clueless.

424
00:19:17,477 --> 00:19:20,912
He won't even know this is happening
until the issue hits the stands.

425
00:19:21,308 --> 00:19:24,823
Now I have to go change my clothes. I have
a million things to do before tonight.

426
00:19:28,146 --> 00:19:30,543
It's almost scary
how easy this is.

427
00:19:30,597 --> 00:19:32,283
You are evil.

428
00:19:34,117 --> 00:19:37,093
I'm so going as
you for Halloween!

429
00:19:46,456 --> 00:19:48,430
I read your letter
from the editor.

430
00:19:48,486 --> 00:19:49,652
And?

431
00:19:49,786 --> 00:19:51,110
It's good.

432
00:19:51,497 --> 00:19:53,722
Your voice got all high,
like when I ask you to stay late

433
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:56,360
and you say, "I don't mind."

434
00:19:56,418 --> 00:19:58,883
No. No,
it's--it's a good letter.

435
00:19:58,938 --> 00:20:01,693
It's just--it's about shoes.

436
00:20:01,747 --> 00:20:03,653
And this is a fashion
magazine, right?

437
00:20:03,705 --> 00:20:05,772
But this isn't just
any issue of "Mode."

438
00:20:05,825 --> 00:20:07,712
I mean, with everything that's
been going on with your family,

439
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,512
people are gonna be looking to
this as your public statement.

440
00:20:10,568 --> 00:20:13,292
Don't you think you should write
something a little bit more...

441
00:20:13,527 --> 00:20:14,841
personal?

442
00:20:15,018 --> 00:20:17,401
- Maybe you could--
- I can't.

443
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,193
Is it too painful?

444
00:20:19,246 --> 00:20:22,580
No, I-I mean, literally,
I-I can't. I...

445
00:20:23,776 --> 00:20:26,033
I don't know how to
write a letter like that.

446
00:20:26,085 --> 00:20:28,682
Daniel, I read your
letter every month.

447
00:20:28,737 --> 00:20:32,153
It's always funny
and smart and...

448
00:20:32,695 --> 00:20:35,871
It's one of the things that
makes you such an amazing editor.

449
00:20:35,927 --> 00:20:38,841
I don't exactly
write those letters.

450
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:41,123
You know Jeremy from features?

451
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:45,521
He kind of writes them, and I just--
I sign my name to them.

452
00:20:45,575 --> 00:20:47,373
That's dishonest.

453
00:20:47,426 --> 00:20:50,273
How is your
boyfriend Marc doing?

454
00:20:50,328 --> 00:20:51,533
Point taken.

455
00:20:51,586 --> 00:20:53,372
I am not a writer, Betty.

456
00:20:53,426 --> 00:20:55,490
I can't do this.
I'm barely an editor.

457
00:20:55,548 --> 00:20:58,182
Daniel, you get a
magazine out every month,

458
00:20:58,238 --> 00:21:00,393
and you do an amazing job.

459
00:21:00,447 --> 00:21:02,791
And you'll do an amazing
job on this letter, too.

460
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:05,111
You just have to
write from the heart.

461
00:21:05,406 --> 00:21:08,951
I mean, you really want your letter to
be about how the pilgrim buckle is back?

462
00:21:09,007 --> 00:21:10,272
Well, it is.

463
00:21:15,468 --> 00:21:16,912
You can do this.

464
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:29,411
There's my little enchilada.

465
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:30,461
Sorry we're late.

466
00:21:30,517 --> 00:21:33,652
Oh, it's not a problem...
uh, baby.

467
00:21:37,105 --> 00:21:39,140
It's my fault.
The cat was acting up.

468
00:21:39,195 --> 00:21:41,051
I couldn't leave
her in the hotel.

469
00:21:41,178 --> 00:21:45,280
Oh. Uh, how did miss Lady Buttons
of Camelot do in the show today?

470
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:47,363
Last place.
I stripped away her title.

471
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:49,493
Her name's just Buttons now.

472
00:21:49,548 --> 00:21:52,080
Okay. Well, let's just sit down
real fast, eat that dinner,

473
00:21:52,138 --> 00:21:53,310
and we'll be out of here.

474
00:21:54,085 --> 00:21:57,603
- Hey, Mr. Suarez.
- Call me Papi.

475
00:21:58,227 --> 00:21:59,383
Too much?

476
00:21:59,608 --> 00:22:01,632
- This is my mom, Jean Weiner.
- Hi.

477
00:22:01,686 --> 00:22:05,092
Yes, we--we talked on the phone.
I love your home. It's so...

478
00:22:05,567 --> 00:22:07,011
festivo.

479
00:22:07,068 --> 00:22:09,833
There they are! Hello!

480
00:22:09,887 --> 00:22:13,211
Hi! I'm Hilda, Betty's sister.

481
00:22:13,655 --> 00:22:17,903
Can you believe these two crazy kids?
So in love!

482
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:21,293
- Uh, let me take your things.
- Oh, oh, thank you.

483
00:22:23,637 --> 00:22:25,142
What is she doing here?

484
00:22:25,196 --> 00:22:27,982
She wouldn't miss
this for the world.

485
00:22:30,197 --> 00:22:31,293
She lives here.

486
00:22:31,347 --> 00:22:32,671
"She lives here."

487
00:22:52,077 --> 00:22:57,763
Taquito, remember that time we
drove upstate to look at the leaves?

488
00:22:57,817 --> 00:23:01,683
Oh, yes! And we listened to
'Nsync the whole way up,

489
00:23:01,737 --> 00:23:03,521
because that's Marc's
favorite band,

490
00:23:03,577 --> 00:23:05,612
and I know that because
I'm his boyfriend--

491
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:07,083
I mean, he's my girlfriend!

492
00:23:07,138 --> 00:23:08,330
I mean...

493
00:23:09,345 --> 00:23:13,573
So, Ms. Weiner, tell us,
how did you get started in cat shows?

494
00:23:13,628 --> 00:23:15,340
Oh, well,
it was just fun at first.

495
00:23:15,398 --> 00:23:18,252
I had a hairless sphynx
named Mr. Meowington

496
00:23:18,305 --> 00:23:20,313
who I entered in
a local pageant.

497
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:23,433
Uh, for his talent competition,
he flushed a toilet.

498
00:23:25,207 --> 00:23:27,631
See? Even a cat can
remember to do it.

499
00:23:27,686 --> 00:23:29,252
Betty, you remind
me of someone.

500
00:23:29,306 --> 00:23:32,600
You have the same sense of humor
as Marc's old roommate Chuck.

501
00:23:32,656 --> 00:23:34,403
Honey, do you ever see Chuck?

502
00:23:34,457 --> 00:23:35,950
I don't wanna talk about him.

503
00:23:36,318 --> 00:23:40,042
Uh, we just...
sort of lost touch.

504
00:23:40,098 --> 00:23:42,950
Oh, he was so handsome.
And they were so close.

505
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:44,220
We weren't that close.

506
00:23:44,275 --> 00:23:46,403
Uh, we were just poker buddies.

507
00:23:46,456 --> 00:23:48,242
I'm guessing a lot of hold'em.

508
00:23:49,005 --> 00:23:51,251
So how long have you
two been going out?

509
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:52,522
- Three months.
- Six months.

510
00:23:52,578 --> 00:23:54,841
I mean six months.
It has been six months.

511
00:23:54,898 --> 00:23:56,740
It just feels like
three months.

512
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:00,050
Our first date we watched
"High School Musical,"

513
00:24:00,108 --> 00:24:03,002
because that's Marc's
favorite musical,

514
00:24:03,057 --> 00:24:04,401
and I know that.

515
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,591
Would you guys excuse
us for just a minute?

516
00:24:09,646 --> 00:24:10,653
Treasure?

517
00:24:11,106 --> 00:24:13,102
- Can I see you up in my room?
- Oh, yeah.

518
00:24:16,508 --> 00:24:19,042
Hey, hey. Keep that door open.

519
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:29,433
So this is where
the tragic happens.

520
00:24:29,485 --> 00:24:31,463
Marc, we can't do this anymore.

521
00:24:31,517 --> 00:24:33,881
Marc! We are not
convincing anybody.

522
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:36,111
I keep waiting
for Mr. Roper to show up.

523
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:37,972
You agreed to this.
I helped you with Daniel.

524
00:24:38,028 --> 00:24:40,852
You're a grown man.
Tell her the truth.

525
00:24:40,906 --> 00:24:42,630
- She might surprise you.
- Are you kidding?

526
00:24:42,687 --> 00:24:45,290
Look what happened with Lady Buttons,
and that was just over a stupid ribbon.

527
00:24:45,328 --> 00:24:46,682
No, no.

528
00:24:46,976 --> 00:24:49,921
I'm her child, her favorite.

529
00:24:49,975 --> 00:24:52,340
I can't disappoint her.
Come on, come on.

530
00:25:01,425 --> 00:25:05,091
How do you tell someone after ten
years that none of it's been real?

531
00:25:07,136 --> 00:25:08,992
If I tell her the truth now,

532
00:25:09,065 --> 00:25:10,713
then we've got nothing.

533
00:25:10,915 --> 00:25:12,853
Well, what do you have now?

534
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:17,113
Two visits and Christmas?
That's not a relationship.

535
00:25:17,408 --> 00:25:18,860
It's too late.

536
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:20,550
No, it's not.

537
00:25:20,736 --> 00:25:24,483
Marc, you have a mother,
and she is downstairs.

538
00:25:24,538 --> 00:25:27,153
And you still have a chance to
make her a part of your life.

539
00:25:27,206 --> 00:25:29,060
Do you know what I
would give for that?

540
00:25:31,508 --> 00:25:33,652
My family's not
your family, okay?

541
00:25:34,626 --> 00:25:38,721
So let's turn that
moustache upside down,

542
00:25:38,868 --> 00:25:41,383
go downstairs and finish dinner...
and then we'll be out of here.

543
00:25:41,418 --> 00:25:44,971
Okay, but let's bring it
back down to a man's voice.

544
00:25:47,638 --> 00:25:49,112
Hi, aunt Betty.

545
00:25:49,236 --> 00:25:51,070
Hi, uncle Marc.

546
00:25:51,598 --> 00:25:53,291
What's your son doing here?

547
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:54,491
Nephew.

548
00:25:54,835 --> 00:25:57,352
Sorry. Justin was supposed to be
having dinner with his father.

549
00:25:57,407 --> 00:26:00,302
But don't worry. I had a little
chat with him. He's on board.

550
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,680
Ew. Dad tried to take
me out for fast food.

551
00:26:02,735 --> 00:26:04,781
Chicken nuggets are 15 points.

552
00:26:04,837 --> 00:26:06,260
It's almost bathing
suit season!

553
00:26:06,317 --> 00:26:08,001
Would you just help
me clear the plates?

554
00:26:08,055 --> 00:26:10,060
So, Hilda, you're a single mom?

555
00:26:10,116 --> 00:26:11,570
That must be hard.

556
00:26:11,628 --> 00:26:14,000
How long ago did you
and your husband split?

557
00:26:14,057 --> 00:26:16,441
Oh, we were never actually married.
You know, prom night,

558
00:26:16,495 --> 00:26:18,613
condom breaks, long story.

559
00:26:19,757 --> 00:26:21,723
Actually not.
That's pretty much it.

560
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:25,093
Well, that's a lot
of information.

561
00:26:25,147 --> 00:26:25,992
Hey, I'll get that.

562
00:26:26,046 --> 00:26:28,950
Hey, Betty, look what I
silk-screened at a class today.

563
00:26:29,738 --> 00:26:31,730
Ooh, is that some celebrity?

564
00:26:31,788 --> 00:26:32,630
No, uh...

565
00:26:32,687 --> 00:26:34,481
Are you kidding?
She totally is.

566
00:26:34,537 --> 00:26:37,933
Claire Meade-- she murdered Fey Sommers,
but she was completely justified.

567
00:26:37,987 --> 00:26:41,843
It was a crime of passion, and I will
not rest until that woman is free.

568
00:26:41,895 --> 00:26:43,973
I'm starting a petition
at school tomorrow.

569
00:26:44,496 --> 00:26:46,483
What a pretty kitty.
Can I pet her?

570
00:26:47,456 --> 00:26:49,720
He's starting a petition
to help out a murderer?

571
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,430
They're going with insanity.

572
00:26:52,026 --> 00:26:55,350
Really, it just helps
Justin focus his anxiety.

573
00:26:55,408 --> 00:26:58,720
He's still pretty upset about the
"Dreamgirls"... best picture snub.

574
00:26:58,778 --> 00:27:00,282
"Babel"? What's "Babel"?

575
00:27:00,338 --> 00:27:03,720
Oh, my god, I know. "Dreamgirls"
was a cinematic achievement...

576
00:27:03,928 --> 00:27:07,612
and, uh... whew. How 'bout the
boobs on that Beyoncé, huh?

577
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:09,370
Papi, I can't get the
lid off the trash can.

578
00:27:09,405 --> 00:27:11,663
Ooh, the cat!
It's going for the door! Dad!

579
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:14,271
- I got it! I got it!
- Wait, papi, you can't go out!

580
00:27:15,487 --> 00:27:18,083
Oh! Oh, Buttons.
What is that noise?

581
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:20,052
- Grandpa's under house arrest.
- Yes, Constance.

582
00:27:20,108 --> 00:27:23,140
- Did he murder someone, too?
- No! No, he's not a criminal.

583
00:27:23,196 --> 00:27:26,042
- He's an illegal immigrant.
- We don't tell people that!

584
00:27:26,118 --> 00:27:28,602
Are you sure you want to get
involved with this family?

585
00:27:30,576 --> 00:27:32,820
What's he doing here?

586
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,672
Daniel.

587
00:27:35,727 --> 00:27:37,101
Who's Daniel?

588
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:40,660
He's... Betty's ex-boyfriend.

589
00:27:42,076 --> 00:27:44,880
What? I can't play, too?

590
00:27:52,057 --> 00:27:53,111
Thank you.

591
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:56,992
Oh, Claire.

592
00:27:57,048 --> 00:27:58,601
How did you get in here?

593
00:27:58,656 --> 00:28:00,512
Only family is permitted.

594
00:28:01,025 --> 00:28:03,611
I'm your incredibly tan sister.

595
00:28:05,585 --> 00:28:07,231
Let me look at you.

596
00:28:07,287 --> 00:28:10,180
Oh, you poor thing.

597
00:28:10,236 --> 00:28:12,113
And handcuffs?

598
00:28:13,206 --> 00:28:14,852
I have committed a crime.

599
00:28:14,907 --> 00:28:17,873
Not letting a woman have her
makeup bag-- now that's a crime.

600
00:28:19,857 --> 00:28:21,453
What do you want, Wilhelmina?

601
00:28:21,505 --> 00:28:24,151
I came out of great
concern for your children.

602
00:28:24,466 --> 00:28:27,231
Things are not going well
with Daniel and Alexis,

603
00:28:27,286 --> 00:28:30,193
and I fear they'll soon
destroy the magazine...

604
00:28:30,246 --> 00:28:31,802
and each other.

605
00:28:32,316 --> 00:28:33,810
Much better.

606
00:28:35,326 --> 00:28:39,341
So I thought if there's a
way to salvage what's left...

607
00:28:39,396 --> 00:28:43,860
if there were someone who could,
um, supervise, perhaps mediate.

608
00:28:43,915 --> 00:28:45,860
And I suppose that
person would be you?

609
00:28:45,917 --> 00:28:49,061
I practically ran the magazine
when Daniel was in charge.

610
00:28:49,115 --> 00:28:53,091
It's that I--I have no authority
in my current position.

611
00:28:53,145 --> 00:28:55,371
And you want me to do
something about that?

612
00:28:55,427 --> 00:28:57,450
Well, I don't know what,

613
00:28:57,505 --> 00:29:01,653
except maybe have your attorneys
draw up some contracts.

614
00:29:01,805 --> 00:29:05,583
- I believe the phrase is, um--
- "Power of attorney"?

615
00:29:06,737 --> 00:29:08,423
Yeah, something like that.

616
00:29:08,478 --> 00:29:11,391
It would be a way for me to
rightfully protect them.

617
00:29:11,446 --> 00:29:13,552
After all, I am a mother, too.

618
00:29:13,605 --> 00:29:15,093
You're telling me.

619
00:29:15,168 --> 00:29:16,792
Cut the act, Wilhelmina.

620
00:29:16,845 --> 00:29:19,391
I'm not Bradford or one of
those other suits in that office

621
00:29:19,447 --> 00:29:23,653
who can get taken in by your
collagen smile and your plastic ass.

622
00:29:24,507 --> 00:29:25,761
I see.

623
00:29:26,518 --> 00:29:27,712
Well...

624
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:30,831
perhaps I can offer you something
that might change your mind.

625
00:29:33,937 --> 00:29:37,170
I know you're drying
out and all, but...

626
00:29:37,226 --> 00:29:39,570
one little sip couldn't hurt,
could it?

627
00:29:42,377 --> 00:29:48,012
I bet this would make those
icechips taste so much better.

628
00:29:48,485 --> 00:29:52,112
You actually think that I would sell
out my children for a lousy drink?

629
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,972
Maybe not one,
but after four or five,

630
00:29:55,107 --> 00:29:57,421
you've been known
to do a lot worse.

631
00:29:58,698 --> 00:30:00,550
You listen to me, Wilhelmina,

632
00:30:00,607 --> 00:30:02,211
and you listen good.

633
00:30:02,268 --> 00:30:03,962
I know who you are,

634
00:30:04,018 --> 00:30:06,600
and you are not getting
your hands on this company.

635
00:30:06,657 --> 00:30:09,290
That slut Fey Sommers may
have become editor-in-chief

636
00:30:09,348 --> 00:30:12,490
by going after my husband,
but from now on,

637
00:30:12,705 --> 00:30:17,501
the only person running this
magazine will be a Meade.

638
00:30:17,555 --> 00:30:18,800
Well...

639
00:30:20,365 --> 00:30:22,431
sorry you feel
that way, Claire.

640
00:30:22,547 --> 00:30:29,803
Perhaps I can offer this to
you with my humblest apologies.

641
00:30:33,785 --> 00:30:34,993
Oh, darn.

642
00:30:35,048 --> 00:30:36,793
You can't reach that, can you?

643
00:30:37,986 --> 00:30:40,100
Oops. Look at the time.

644
00:30:40,156 --> 00:30:41,490
I gotta run.

645
00:30:42,128 --> 00:30:43,432
Sorry, dear.

646
00:31:03,397 --> 00:31:04,670
So did he pop the question yet?

647
00:31:04,728 --> 00:31:06,440
Stop. It's not funny.

648
00:31:06,495 --> 00:31:09,111
I had to kiss him,
and he wears lip gloss.

649
00:31:09,447 --> 00:31:11,733
All right.
So I finished the letter.

650
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:13,300
Just wanted you to read it.

651
00:31:13,428 --> 00:31:15,380
I think it turned
out pretty well.

652
00:31:15,587 --> 00:31:18,133
"He ain't heavy,
she's my brother."

653
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:22,841
So if you can proof it, e-mail it to
Alexis, she can put it in the book.

654
00:31:22,896 --> 00:31:25,130
It just has to beat the
printer's by tomorrow morning.

655
00:31:25,188 --> 00:31:26,940
You know,
you could've just e-mailed this to me.

656
00:31:26,977 --> 00:31:30,370
Yeah, but I-I wanted to
see the look on your face

657
00:31:30,425 --> 00:31:32,733
when you're not
disappointed in me.

658
00:31:35,007 --> 00:31:36,893
Could you please come in here?
My mother's lost an earring

659
00:31:36,925 --> 00:31:39,061
and is convinced that your
father has stolen it.

660
00:31:39,116 --> 00:31:40,803
Could you give us a minute?

661
00:31:43,297 --> 00:31:45,311
The honeymoon is
definitely over.

662
00:31:47,237 --> 00:31:49,690
As much as fun as I make
of all your pep talks,

663
00:31:49,745 --> 00:31:51,721
they actually kind
of make me feel...

664
00:31:52,468 --> 00:31:53,670
peppy.

665
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:01,900
What are you doing?

666
00:32:01,955 --> 00:32:04,253
I just wanted to read this letter.
Daniel worked really hard on it.

667
00:32:04,288 --> 00:32:06,502
Well, forget that stupid
letter and come back in here.

668
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:08,640
- It's not stupid.
- No, but Daniel is.

669
00:32:08,697 --> 00:32:10,821
Alexis isn't even putting
that thing in the magazine.

670
00:32:10,876 --> 00:32:13,111
- She's not in charge!
- No one told her that.

671
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:14,963
She's re-done the entire issue.

672
00:32:15,015 --> 00:32:18,243
It's already on its way to the printer.
So please forget that and come in here.

673
00:32:18,295 --> 00:32:19,513
Oh, my god.

674
00:32:20,176 --> 00:32:21,690
I have to go catch Daniel.

675
00:32:21,747 --> 00:32:24,531
No, Betty.
Betty, you can't go. Betty!

676
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:28,853
He--he is your ex-boyfriend.
I am your current boyfriend!

677
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,951
He is my boss,
and you're an idiot!

678
00:32:31,007 --> 00:32:34,153
Ho, ho! We're gonna talk about
this in couples counseling!

679
00:32:45,328 --> 00:32:47,341
Come on!
We haven't moved in 20 minutes!

680
00:32:47,395 --> 00:32:50,311
I'm e-mailing the printer again.
Is it okay if I type "stop the presses"?

681
00:32:50,326 --> 00:32:52,003
I can't believe I trusted her.

682
00:32:52,256 --> 00:32:54,310
- I am so stupid.
- No, you're not.

683
00:32:54,368 --> 00:32:57,322
You were giving Alexis a chance. You
wanted to believe the best in people.

684
00:32:57,378 --> 00:32:59,211
We're never gonna
get there in time.

685
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:01,792
You know,
the printer's not that far away.

686
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:03,342
Come on!

687
00:33:07,348 --> 00:33:09,453
- Excuse me!
- Sorry. Coming through.

688
00:33:14,087 --> 00:33:15,411
I just don't understand.

689
00:33:15,468 --> 00:33:18,162
Betty took off with
her ex-boyfriend?

690
00:33:18,217 --> 00:33:20,730
Marc, don't you
think that's weird?

691
00:33:21,485 --> 00:33:24,400
Uh, mom, there's-- there's
something that I need to tell you

692
00:33:24,455 --> 00:33:27,232
about... me.

693
00:33:27,788 --> 00:33:29,931
I am...

694
00:33:33,337 --> 00:33:35,310
breaking up with Betty.

695
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:38,653
Thank god!

696
00:33:38,927 --> 00:33:40,970
Wait, you didn't like her?

697
00:33:41,025 --> 00:33:42,972
Marc, honey, let's be honest.

698
00:33:43,026 --> 00:33:45,792
With that hair and that face, what
were my grandchildren gonna look like?

699
00:33:45,827 --> 00:33:49,230
Mom! Mom, Betty and her family
were pretty nice to us tonight.

700
00:33:49,285 --> 00:33:51,160
Her family?
Don't get me started on the family.

701
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:54,180
Her father-- why should I pay his taxes?
He broke into this country.

702
00:33:54,236 --> 00:33:55,591
- Mom.
- And the sister?

703
00:33:55,645 --> 00:33:58,460
I don't wanna use the "s" word...
but slut. There. I said it.

704
00:33:58,518 --> 00:34:00,472
No wonder she got knocked
up in the second grade.

705
00:34:00,486 --> 00:34:03,651
The "Golden Girls"
marathon is on!

706
00:34:03,707 --> 00:34:06,143
And I don't even
know what that is.

707
00:34:06,195 --> 00:34:07,231
"That"?

708
00:34:07,285 --> 00:34:10,400
Please, he's just so... swishy!

709
00:34:10,657 --> 00:34:12,852
The mother doesn't say anything.
It just makes me sick.

710
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:14,472
Okay, shut your mouth, mom!

711
00:34:14,527 --> 00:34:15,610
Why did you say to me?

712
00:34:15,665 --> 00:34:18,093
You don't get to talk about
these people like that.

713
00:34:18,145 --> 00:34:20,640
They did a really nice
thing for me tonight.

714
00:34:21,047 --> 00:34:24,480
And that little boy...

715
00:34:25,225 --> 00:34:27,383
Swishy? Swishy.

716
00:34:30,218 --> 00:34:32,052
You wanna talk about swishy?

717
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,341
Open your eyes, mom,
and look at your own swishy son.

718
00:34:40,107 --> 00:34:41,413
You know what?

719
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,943
- I gotta get to the hotel.
- No, no, no.

720
00:34:44,998 --> 00:34:46,440
You don't get to go.

721
00:34:46,546 --> 00:34:49,003
Because I may never be
this brave again, mom.

722
00:34:49,058 --> 00:34:52,303
I-I-I love you, but--

723
00:34:52,456 --> 00:34:53,700
Do not say it.

724
00:34:53,755 --> 00:34:55,522
I am what you think I am.

725
00:34:55,576 --> 00:34:58,152
- You're confused.
- No. No.

726
00:34:58,326 --> 00:35:00,022
For once, I'm not.

727
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,931
If you wanna get to know me...

728
00:35:04,086 --> 00:35:06,132
it has to be the real me.

729
00:35:06,306 --> 00:35:07,912
The real you, huh?

730
00:35:11,675 --> 00:35:16,012
Well, if this is the
life you've chosen...

731
00:35:20,036 --> 00:35:23,021
I have no interest in
knowing the real you.

732
00:35:25,846 --> 00:35:29,772
Thank these people
for a lovely evening.

733
00:35:36,286 --> 00:35:37,791
Come on. We're almost there.

734
00:35:38,708 --> 00:35:39,932
Come on, Betty.

735
00:35:42,105 --> 00:35:43,330
Hurry up.

736
00:35:43,388 --> 00:35:45,732
Son of a bitch.

737
00:35:47,668 --> 00:35:49,900
I think I'm having
a heart attack!

738
00:35:50,846 --> 00:35:51,962
Seriously?

739
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:53,983
No, I'm just
being melodramatic.

740
00:35:54,038 --> 00:35:55,402
Hey, Daniel.

741
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,683
Hey, Betty.

742
00:35:58,056 --> 00:36:00,590
Run, Daniel!

743
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:02,053
Whatever happened to sharing?

744
00:36:02,107 --> 00:36:03,683
What about doing it for mom?

745
00:36:03,738 --> 00:36:04,973
Plans change.

746
00:36:05,027 --> 00:36:06,272
I'm not a kid anymore!

747
00:36:06,327 --> 00:36:08,090
Yeah, but I'm still gonna win.

748
00:36:42,656 --> 00:36:43,892
Yes!

749
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:54,173
Hey!

750
00:36:54,457 --> 00:36:56,511
I got your text. What happened?

751
00:36:56,567 --> 00:36:58,512
Is this a celebration drink?
Are you buying?

752
00:36:58,567 --> 00:37:00,021
Can I have a banana daiquiri?

753
00:37:00,096 --> 00:37:04,680
Uh, could we get a banana daiquiri for
the lady and another scotch, please?

754
00:37:05,228 --> 00:37:07,941
It's a funny story.

755
00:37:09,307 --> 00:37:11,563
Alex won.

756
00:37:11,615 --> 00:37:14,012
Well, she couldn't have gotten there
much earlier. Come on. Let's go.

757
00:37:14,048 --> 00:37:15,220
We can just tell
the printer to stop.

758
00:37:15,258 --> 00:37:16,532
No, no, Betty.
Don't you get it?

759
00:37:16,546 --> 00:37:18,771
If it's not this,
it's gonna be something else.

760
00:37:18,926 --> 00:37:22,761
Alex is faster than me.
He'll always be faster than me.

761
00:37:22,818 --> 00:37:24,122
So we're giving up?

762
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:27,363
Look, my whole family has always
thought I've been a big screw up

763
00:37:27,416 --> 00:37:29,052
when it comes to this job.

764
00:37:29,107 --> 00:37:31,841
I'm just trying not
to disappoint them.

765
00:37:32,897 --> 00:37:35,532
Oh. Almost forgot.

766
00:37:35,717 --> 00:37:38,822
Advance copy. Printer was
nice enough to give it to me.

767
00:37:39,406 --> 00:37:41,292
She put herself on the cover?

768
00:37:41,348 --> 00:37:43,401
She always knows how
to get at my dad.

769
00:37:44,688 --> 00:37:47,631
You should read the letter from
the editor. It puts mine to shame.

770
00:37:47,836 --> 00:37:51,011
Actually, I don't
need this anymore.

771
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:53,923
I'm sorry.

772
00:37:53,977 --> 00:37:55,133
Don't be.

773
00:37:55,186 --> 00:37:58,971
Betty, I'm finally free. I've wasted
all that time behind the desk.

774
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,643
If Alex wants to take over,
then let him.

775
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,030
I got lots of partying
to catch up on.

776
00:38:34,475 --> 00:38:35,851
Working late?

777
00:38:38,058 --> 00:38:39,603
A lot to catch up on.

778
00:38:39,657 --> 00:38:42,673
Bradford, I'm so
sorry about Claire.

779
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:46,311
I know how hard it must be to
come home to an empty house.

780
00:38:47,186 --> 00:38:53,001
How about a little
dinner and some company?

781
00:39:00,666 --> 00:39:01,990
You're still here?

782
00:39:03,017 --> 00:39:05,831
I'm sorry I ran out earlier.

783
00:39:06,245 --> 00:39:07,602
How'd it go?

784
00:39:10,366 --> 00:39:13,091
Things got a little
messy after you left.

785
00:39:14,207 --> 00:39:16,360
I was outed to my mother.

786
00:39:17,286 --> 00:39:18,473
What?

787
00:39:18,987 --> 00:39:21,203
Who was it? My father?

788
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:23,831
No, no. It wasn't him.

789
00:39:25,315 --> 00:39:26,561
It was me.

790
00:39:28,377 --> 00:39:30,331
- Wow.
- Yeah.

791
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:33,251
She left.

792
00:39:37,737 --> 00:39:39,273
You know what, Marc?

793
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:43,922
I learned something
about family tonight.

794
00:39:46,155 --> 00:39:48,740
They're not always the ones
who love you the most.

795
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:54,192
Sometimes it's the family
that you make for yourself.

796
00:39:55,828 --> 00:39:57,921
Okay, okay.

797
00:39:58,567 --> 00:40:02,583
It's getting a little too "life
time original movie" for me.

798
00:40:03,998 --> 00:40:05,432
But I get it.

799
00:40:07,527 --> 00:40:10,273
She doesn't wanna be a
part of my life, then...

800
00:40:10,788 --> 00:40:12,151
it's her loss.

801
00:40:13,606 --> 00:40:17,330
Because I'm freakin' fabulous.

802
00:40:17,525 --> 00:40:19,282
Yes, you are.

803
00:40:20,145 --> 00:40:21,932
And just so you know,

804
00:40:22,547 --> 00:40:25,012
you'll always be my
little chimichanga.

805
00:40:27,837 --> 00:40:29,813
Doesn't mean I like you.

806
00:40:41,656 --> 00:40:43,923
"The great return of
Alexis Meade is a story

807
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:46,370
"that's been played out
enough in the media,

808
00:40:46,428 --> 00:40:48,932
"so I won't go into
all the details here.

809
00:40:48,986 --> 00:40:53,251
"But I will admit that I didn't
welcome my brother back at first,

810
00:40:53,788 --> 00:40:57,063
"partly because I wasn't used
to seeing him in a satin pump.

811
00:40:57,117 --> 00:41:00,133
"Mostly because
when he went away,

812
00:41:00,438 --> 00:41:02,112
"he broke my heart.

813
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:04,423
"So I was mad.

814
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,750
"But when I looked past
my anger and his makeup,

happy to have him back.

816

'her.' I missed her so much.
