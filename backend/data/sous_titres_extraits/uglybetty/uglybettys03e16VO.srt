1
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,790
aunt betty...

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,430
darn it.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,230
You're finally setting
up a facebook page?

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,460
Everyone at Y.E.T.I.Is on it.

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,980
I'm trying to get a photo
up before today's class.

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,410
Tina brown is speaking.

7
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,970
can you get her to sign
my "diana chronicles"?

8
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,180
- Yeah.
- Ooh,is that worth something?

9
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,990
Because if we sell
it,maybe we can redecorate.

10
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,290
Some customers came in,said
the place was looking raggedy.

11
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,850
Don't even joke about my "dichron.

12
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,210
" And they were talking about grandpa.

13
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,380
Ay,with the robe and the moping.

14
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,270
Yod think elena had
been gone for a month.

15
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,820
So I'm a little down.

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,000
Elena's away.Let me feel the pain.

17
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,110
Papi... she has been in
california for three days.

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,100
Oh,I miss her.

19
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,520
Finally I understand what
country music's all about.

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,730
Dad,you haven't been in a
relationship in a long time.

21
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,810
You'll have to get used
to the ups and downs again.

22
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,250
Hi,daniel.

23
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,420
Oh,betty,I'm really sick.

24
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,770
I think I'm dying.

25
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,720
You always think you're
dying when you're sick.

26
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,160
,But this time I really am.

27
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,690
I'm all stuffed up,my heart is racing...

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,190
well,do you want me to call a doctor?

29
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,440
please.It just hurts to dial.

30
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,930
and do you want me to set
up a room at the amsterdam?

31
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,360
I'm already there.

32
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,580
Oh,they brought me cookies.

33
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,240
Daniel likes to check into a
fancy hotel when he's feeling sick.

34
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,190
okay,I will send the doctor to you.

35
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,300
Daniel,you are going to be okay.

36
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,720
I'll call you from the office.

37
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,270
Thanks,betty.

38
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,510
sounds like somebody's a big baby.

39
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,130
He just likes to be taken care
of when he's feeling lousy.

40
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,120
It must be nice to be rich.

41
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,680
oh,my god,the baby.

42
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:50,340
connor.Connor.Connor!

43
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,070
You looked so peaceful,so I thought I'd
bring william in here and let you sleep in.

44
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,440
Sorry.

45
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,780
Maternal instincts.

46
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,320
I suddenly had the urge to
strangle someone to protect him.

47
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,220
Why don't you go back to bed?
I got breakfast from payard.

48
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:11,210
What did I do to deserve this?

49
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:22,770
I wish I could jusno work,no one
else,just... you and me and the baby.

50
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,870
Well,better yet,what if we ran
away somewhere distant and exotic,

51
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,310
where no one could find us?

52
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,590
Well,that would be fabulous.

53
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,180
If only those morons we work
with could get anything right,

54
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,880
then we wouldn't have
to go in to work at all.

55
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,540
good morning,amanda.

56
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,060
Betty,wait.

57
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:48,970
What?

58
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,170
I need to know that you
know what you're wearing.

59
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,640
There you are.We're
gonna be late for Y.E.T.I.

60
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,610
Come on.

61
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,580
- Marc,we've got,like--
27 minutes and 15 seconds.

62
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,410
14... 13... chop,chop,slowpoke-ahontas.

63
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:04,820
I need to be on the street right now...
hearing you gasp for breath behind me.

64
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,830
Ooh,molly,hey.

65
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,700
Did you get your leak fixed?

66
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,240
- Leak?
- Your apartment.

67
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,110
Daniel told me that you had a lk

68
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,740
Yeah,it's fine.Totally fixed.

69
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,390
Actually,is daniel in his
office?I sorta need to talk to him.

70
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,250
No,he's out sick.

71
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,250
You know how he gets.He doesn't
really like people to see him--

72
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:23,810
he's at the amsterdam under the name
"mr.Sickington." Give our love to pasty-face!

73
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,960
Hey,marc,daniel's sick name
is supposed to be a secret.

74
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,120
Really?

75
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,670
I am not missing tina brown.

76
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:38,200
I am afraid you're all
going to miss ti brown.

77
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,140
She had to cancel.

78
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,760
I'll be honest.

79
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,680
Last night,there was some drinking.

80
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,240
Some things were said.

81
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,880
Somebody's husband may or may
not have grabbed somebody's boob.

82
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:55,290
But it's you people who suffer.

83
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,170
Wow,that really sucks.

84
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,300
Tina was going to talk to us about how
the economics in the business are changing.

85
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:10,100
So with that topic in mind,I have
arranged a special surprise guest.

86
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,160
Do you know who it is?

87
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,620
I don't know,but let us pray.

88
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,330
Graydon carter,david
remnick,anna wintour...

89
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,920
stanley mudge!

90
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,890
- who is he?Is he famous?
- No.And he's old.

91
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,750
Stanley was the head of
accounting at hearst until 1985.

92
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:34,190
He's here to talk to
you about...  budgets!

93
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,710
Kill me now.

94
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,980
thank you,stanley.

95
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,250
You make amortization... sexy.

96
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,340
Okay,homework.

97
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:58,060
I want all of you to get copies of your
magazine's issue budgets for this year.

98
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,800
I've already e-mailed each
of your bosses and okayed it.

99
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,870
Learn those budgets backwards
and forwards,because next class,

100
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,580
I want each one of you to
do a presentation on them.

101
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,690
Okay.That's it,go.

102
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,230
- hey,pretty girl...
- oh,so today I don't look like dora the explorer?

103
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,660
Did I say that?

104
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,280
that's funny.

105
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,860
What do you want?

106
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,200
Well,I was thinking,since we both work
at the same magazine,how about this?

107
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:30,410
I'll let you do the fun-fun numbers
stuff,while I'll do the heavy lifting

108
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,130
and come up with a colorful
haout,put both of our names on it.

109
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,120
What do you think?

110
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,960
Marc,I'm not great at numbers,either,

111
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,400
so why don't we just take this as
an opportunity to help each other?

112
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,140
Fine.But you gotta carry
your own weight,suarez.

113
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,220
That's it?You're not
gonna make a fat joke?

114
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,990
we're progressing!

115
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,230
And it was right
there.Oh,well,next time.

116
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,290
Hey,just happened to overhear that you are not
very good at numbers,and I sort of have an M.B.A.

117
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,420
Wow,matt,you have an M.B.A?

118
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,750
Also half a law degree.

119
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,640
And I almost became a large animal vet.

120
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:09,050
It's a long story,but,um,anyway,I was thinking
maybe we could go out,grab a drink and talk budgets?

121
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:09,860
Smooth.

122
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,800
Oh,that's so sweet.You know what?I
think we're gonna be okay on this one.

123
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,420
Thank you,though.

124
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,550
betty suarez,you saucy minx.

125
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,720
What are you talking about?

126
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,780
I'm talking about tall,dork and handsome
back there asking you out on a date.

127
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,060
Oh,no,he was just offering to
help us with our budget homework.

128
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,860
- It wasn't anything.
- Are you serious?

129
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,300
It was like two of those
weird show dogs trying to mate,

130
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,560
and it's all wrong,like a
greyhound and a chihuahua.

131
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:38,280
- The poor chihuahua's--
okay,okay,I get the point!Thank you.

132
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,570
So what if it was a date?

133
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,570
well,so what if it was a
date?well,do you like him?

134
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,550
Well,I don't know.I mean,he's
cute,and he's nice and all.

135
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,970
Oh,give him a shot at love,tila tequila!

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,910
Yeah,but what if it didn't work out?Then
I'd have to see him,like,all the time.

137
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,320
Speaking of which,is it gonna be
weird for you going down to accounting?

138
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,130
- No,why would it be weird?- Because it's
where henry,your former lov-ah,worked.

139
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,130
Okay,ew to the word   "lov-ah,"
and you're being ridiculous,marc.

140
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,630
I'm totally over henry grubstick.

141
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,970
Wow,it sure takes a while to get rid of
cubicle nameplates,not that imatters to me.

142
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,640
I mean,it's got nothing to do with me.

143
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,510
Uh,so,jenny,let's talk budgets.

144
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,510
Actually,funny you should
bring up henry's old cubicle.

145
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,400
He was really the best at budgets.

146
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,520
He was,wasn't he?

147
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,630
Uh,yeah,I remember
that.So,uh,budgets--

148
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,160
hey,has anyone heard from
good ol' budget-making henry?

149
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,570
Well,yeah,all the time.

150
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,080
He's on facebook.

151
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:29,910
He is?

152
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,620
Sorry,you probably remember.

153
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,460
Betty's henry's ex.She's
a little obsess-Y.

154
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,760
I'm not obsess-Y.

155
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,620
- Is this fun for you?
- A little.

156
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,960
Oh,if it helps,it seems
like henry's really happy.

157
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,990
He posted all these awesome pictures
of him and his girlfriend in peru.

158
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,080
Charlie.

159
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,480
No,I think this girl's named samantha.

160
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,570
I just can't believe henry's
already in a serious relationship.

161
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,890
Aunt betty,you had a crush
on your emo neighbor guy.

162
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,260
I know,I know,you're rig.

163
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,760
You're right.

164
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,920
It'sust my crush was a
crush.It wasn't a trip to peru.

165
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,940
Well,people move on.

166
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,640
You',ightjustin,you're right.

167
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,320
Okay,maybe it was a little hard
for me to go down to accounting,

168
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,600
but... I mean,I haven't even
thought about him in,like,months,

169
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,380
so why this is bothering
me... I don't know.

170
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,870
You know what I do when I can't get
my mind off of something or someone?

171
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:25,890
What?

172
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,640
I channel it into a project.

173
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,810
Hello?You think I
really care about macram?

174
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,710
okay,bad example,'cause I love macram?

175
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,940
But you get the idea.

176
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,910
Try these budgets.

177
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,240
you all right,betty?You
seem a little jittery.

178
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,540
Oh,I just had a little bit of coffee
and an energy drink called viper strike.

179
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,210
Have you seen those ads?"The
drink that bites back!

180
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,140
Viper strike!

181
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,280
"  uh,have you tried tea?

182
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:16,090
Are you--are you
shopping for jewelry?

183
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,650
No.

184
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,260
daniel,is that for molly?

185
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,110
Maybe.

186
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,180
That looks kinda serious.

187
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,630
Okay,betty,I'm dying.

188
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:29,080
I'm sure you didn't come over here to
talk about jewelry and viper strike.

189
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,520
No. No,no,no,no.Okay,sorry.

190
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,090
Look,I was up all night looking
at the "mode" budgets for Y.E.T.I.

191
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:38,290
And kinda trying to keep my mind off
henry and his girlfriend and facebook and--

192
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,390
what are you talking about?

193
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,590
Never mind,and it's a long story.Anyway,

194
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,930
I was trying to add up the quarterly
budgets,and it kept coming up short.

195
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,770
Like,by millions.

196
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,790
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.We're
always moving money from one magazine to another.

197
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,220
I-I don't know,daniel.It's just weird.

198
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,290
okay,betty.

199
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:02,840
My doctor tolde to avoid stres  if you really think
there's a problem,talk to wilhelmina or connor.

200
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:07,410
He's our C.F.O. If there are any money
problems,I'm sure he can fix them.

201
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,000
So you can understand why
I was a little worried.

202
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,740
Absolutely,betty.Look,it's
accounting 101.

203
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,880
Corporations always move money
from one division to another.

204
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,140
And meade is a very large corporation.

205
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,150
Uh... okay.

206
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,190
- It just seems like a lot of money to--
as amusing as I find this conversation--

207
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,230
why am I being polite?It's not amusing.

208
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,130
Leave.

209
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,930
Darling,this isn't anything we
should be concerned with,is it?

210
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,620
Absolutely not.It's nothing.

211
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,660
Oh,we're so lucky to have you.

212
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:56,120
Yeah,hi.Account number
7-6-4-6-7.Pass code "sydney.

213
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,120
" I'm calling about some money
transfers from meade publications.

214
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,690
Looks like I might have to make
my next transfer ahead of schedule.

218
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,360
What do you mean you didn't
finish your homework?I did.

219
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:28,990
And I managed to sneak into the soho
house with my friend's membership.

220
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,250
Why?Because... daniel craig
does not just stalk himself.

221
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,390
Well,I started looking at the
budgets,and then I got distracted.

222
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,610
Oh,you got bored,huh?

223
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,050
I'm bored.

224
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,340
Oh,I know.Let's talk about
who I slept t  las night.

225
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,480
You guys will never guess.

226
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,080
What's up,amanda?

227
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,680
It was him.

228
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,090
- vanilla.
- I know.

229
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,770
Look,marc,I really did want
to finish the assignment,

230
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,840
but then I noticed that there was
something really weird about the numbers.

231
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:00,950
Really?Something that was overlooked by all of the
accountants whose actual job it is to find weird things?

232
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,150
Well,I don't know.It just--
it seemed serious at the time.

233
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,250
And I e-mailed a couple
people at other magazines--

234
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,550
oh... I see where this is going.

235
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:12,200
Yesterday in accounting,I thought it would be funny
to tease betty about henry having a new girlfriend...

236
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,510
but clearly,it struck a nerve.

237
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,460
Henry has a new G.F.?O.M.G.!

238
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,440
No,amanda,I'm fine.

239
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,590
Look,okay,maybe it surprised me.

240
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:22,570
- But I'm totally--
over henry?

241
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:27,070
Nuh-unh.She got upset that henry posted
vacation photos with his girlfriend on facebook.

242
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,040
I know.

243
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,040
Can you talk to me,please?

244
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,160
you know what you need to do?Take all of your
dirty photos of him and post them yourself.

245
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,500
I don't have pictures like that.

246
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,830
Of course you don'T.

247
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,880
but seriously,betty,there's
an easy remedy.

248
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,290
Just find someone new yourself.

249
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,680
What,you actually think that would work?

250
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:49,740
Betty,there is a whole world out there of
goofy,awkward and mumbly guys just waiting to love you.

251
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,540
Hey,how about that skinny thing from
class who's trying to have your puppies?

252
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,790
- call him.
- Yeah.

253
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,910
hello?

254
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,390
Hi,matt.It's betty.

255
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,960
Oh,uh,hi,betty,How are things?

256
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,170
Good,great.

257
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,270
Good,uh,I--I'm still doing
my Y.E.T.I.Assignment and I'm-

258
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,510
betty.

259
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,940
I just wanted to say thanks
for that budget uff before.

260
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,720
I know it wasn't anything,but
I appreciate your moxie.

261
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,130
Uh,yeah,of course.Glad to help.

262
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,880
hello?

263
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,620
I'm so sorry about that,matt.

264
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:36,100
- I was just wondering if
I could ask you--  oh,betty!

265
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:39,320
almost forgot.I need you
to sign these for daniel.

266
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,140
- Got it.
- Thanks.

267
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,580
- hello,betty.
- Do you wanna go get a drink?

268
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,210
- Yeah,I would-- I would
love to.Um... oh,good.

269
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,850
Forgot my pen.

270
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,000
molly!Oh,no,no.I don't want
you to see me like this.

271
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,740
I'm just--I'm miserable and--
and I don't want to get you sick.

272
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,180
I have soup.

273
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,640
Okay. All right.

274
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,830
Actually,daniel,I was
hoping we could talk.

275
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,010
all right,but I'm all stuffed up.

276
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,780
I can barely breathe.My head is
killing me.I really think I'm dying.

277
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,490
- You're not dying.
- I have this weird rash.

278
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,360
It won't go away.It really itches.

279
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,200
Look,I have something
serious to talk to you about.

280
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,120
it's about us.

281
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,980
Hang on a second.I'm sorry.

282
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,310
my ear hasn't popped yet.

283
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,340
I just wanted to,um...

284
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,650
sorry.

285
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:49,300
You obviously need to get better,and I'm
not helping,so I'm just gonna let you rest,

286
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,550
and we can talk about
this some other time.

287
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,190
Okay.

288
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,510

wha--wait,wait.

289
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,790
thanks for the soup!

290
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,110
don't be ridiculous.Of course I'm happy.

291
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,800
Why would you ask me such a thing?

292
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:19,240
Because of what you said
yesterday,about living in that moment--

293
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,330
"just you,me and the baby.

294
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,620
That was a nice moment.

295
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:30,740
Well,what if-- what if
we went somewhere far away

296
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,310
where we could live
that moment all the time,

297
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,370
would you consider that?

298
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,990
Absolutely.

299
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:40,500
Uh,as soon as I put the june issue
to bed,um,we'll go on a long weekend.

300
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,650
- What about london?
- No,willie,I mean for real.

301
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,620
That's--what are
you talking abt?

302
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,910
I've got gaultier on the
line,and he's all in a lather.

303
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,320
About what?

304
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,370
who knows?He's french,he's
gay,anything could set her off.

305
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,040
Connor,I gotta take this.

306
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,970
Of course.

307
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,360
Bonjour,jean paul.

308
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,020
All right,stop crying.

309
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,740
No,no,that doesn't sound crazy at all.

310
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,560
Those quarterly budget
numbers-- they should add up.

311
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,370
Well,that's good,'cause
that's exactly what I thought.

312
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,500
I e-mailed some buddies at a
couple magazines ju to double-check.

313
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,630
Well,I'll bet they'll
tell you what I just did.

314
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,400
Oh,yes,that's right,I
forgotyou have an M.B.A.

315
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,030
- I do.
- And half a law degree.

316
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,400
And what's the other one?

317
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,860
- Uh,I almost became a vet.
- Big animals.

318
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,660
Well,it's nice to see
that you were listening.

319
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,990
I listen.

320
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,160
Oh,okay,okay,then what is--
what's my favorite movie?

321
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,680
Um... wait,is that a trick question?

322
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,040
If you would've said
something,I would've remembered.

323
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:51,050
But if I had to guess,I
would say... "godfather"?

324
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,800
Okay.That's spooky.

325
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,740
Did I get it?

326
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:56,620
No.You just seemed so excited.

327
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,670
It's actually "wall-E.

328
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,240
" I love "wall-E.

329
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,080
" eve-ah.

330
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,850
wall-e!

331
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,240
E-mail.Someone probably
answering my budget questions.

332
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,390

00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,250
so what did they say?

334
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,560
Uh,not about budgets.

335
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,480
Is everything okay?

336
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,330
have you ever found out that
an ex is dating someone new?

337
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,120
Oh,yeah.That--
that's the worst.

338
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,650
Happened to me when
angelina started dating brad.

339
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,500
Yeah,and I got dumped for J.Lo.

340
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,950
Uh,no,I'm--I'm,uh,talking about
angelina bromberg and brad fletcher.

341
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:49,610
Well,I sort of just found
out that this guy I was...

342
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,300
you don't want to hear about this.

343
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,780
no,no,please.

344
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,430
Tell me.

345
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,680
All right,well... his name is henry.

346
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,910
And then to make it worse,he
just tried to "friend" me?

347
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,920
I don't--I don't know why
this bothers me,anyway.

348
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,820
I'm gonna shut up.I've
been talking forever.

349
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm not gonna say anything else.

350
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,880
Is it just me,or is
it,like,freezing in here?

351
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,200
Oh,here,here,give me your hands.

352
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,040
Better?

353
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,920
Hey,matt,you know what?I
should probably get going.

354
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,380
It's getting a little late for me.

355
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,020
it's been fun.Thanks a lot.

356
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,230
Uh,uh,wait,betty,I have
to ask you something.

357
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,340
Matt,I like you,and you're a nice
guy,but we're in class together,

358
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,780
and it could get complicated,and I
don't even know what I want right now.

359
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,990
Okay,this is kind of embarrsing,especially
since you just kinda confessed a lot,

360
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:47,280
but... I sort of forgot my wallet.

361
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,020
what?

362
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:14,930
**********

363
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,260
We're not going to do
anything with this money.

364
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,900
It was a mistake,hilda.

365
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:24,620
I'm just saying,mama could use a couple new
pairs of shoes,a new hair dryer,maybe some rings.

366
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,840
Maybe a new nickname that's not "mama"?

367
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,970
Mama doesn't like your attitude.

368
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,610
This is crazy.

369
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,100
Of course she has to
give back the money.

370
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,530
We don't even know who it belongs to.

371
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,420
Well,the bank told
me it came from meade.

372
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:39,110
So I'll just go to work tomorrow,I'll
figure out what happened,and they'll fix it.

373
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,080
There you go.Yeah,and then on the way,maybe
you stop at 5th avenue a couple of times.

374
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,680
Okay,I'll stop.

375
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,580
Well,look on the bright side.

376
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,810
At least it was a memorable date.

377
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,300
Oh,why did you have to say "date"?

378
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,120
Now I'm thinking date.

379
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,280
I was supposed to lend him money.

380
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,760
That's why I went to the
atm in the first place.

381
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,720
I forgot to go back.

382
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:03,950
He asked you for
money,and you ditched him?

383
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,570
Sounds like the kind
of date I used to have.

384
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,020
Oh,gah,I never should've gone out with
him.Now I have to see him in class.

385
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:14,510
Well,you know what I always say--
don'T... you know,where you... you know.

386
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,380
Elegant,mom.

387
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:20,720
What?I'm just saying,after video store larry
and the subway booth guy,I learned my lesson.

388
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,000
you're right.I'm just-- I'm gonna
apologize and tell him it was a big mistake.

389
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,830
Voice mail.

390
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:29,120
Hi,henry,it's betty.I
mean,matt,it's henry.

391
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,520
Uh,matt,it is betty.

392
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,330
This isn't starting out so well.

393
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:40,110
Hey,betty,a cute-ish
boy is here to see you.

394
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:44,070
is he the one you're trying to
sleep with to get over the other one?

395
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,830
Um,I'm right here.

396
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,690
I know.

397
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:53,320
Um,first of all,please don't
listen to anything she says.

398
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,870
She's crazy.

399
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,790
And second of all,matt,I'm so
sorry that I didn't come back.

400
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,380
- There was this problem with my bank
account-- it worked out okay,actually.

401
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,670
They started me a tab,and,you know,I've
always wanted to be a regular at a bar.

402
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,230
So look,anyway,I just came
b to say that I'm sorry.

403
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,570
For what?I don't know.For--for
pushing you to go out with me.

404
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,360
I mean,you're obviously still
hung up on this other guy.

405
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,630
No,I'm not hung up on henry.

406
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,600
Well,you talked about
him for,like,a half-hour.

407
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,530
Well,that's because you asked me to.

408
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,620
Look,it's over.

409
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,890
That's done. We're both at Y.E.T.I.
And we work in the same business,

410
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,920
and that could just get
complicated.It did with henry.

411
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,670
- It might,but it also
might be great.- Matt--

412
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:31,780
oh,betty,look,okay,my mother and my father--
they got married when they were pretty young.

413
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,740
They didn't have much in common except me,and
now they're divorced,and they hate ch other.

414
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:42,920
the way I see it,two people work in the same
business,maybe it's 'cause they share the same passion.

415
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,980
I think that's a good thing.

416
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,140
If you,uh,change your
mind,you can find me at 1 oak.

417
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,370
Guess I'm a regular now.

418
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,100
this is weird.

419
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,890
I don't know why that money
would've been moved like that.

420
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,100
Well,can't you just
check who authorized it?

421
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,880
Uh,let's see.

422
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:08,870
looks like it was... "B.Suarez."

423
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,120
What?No.No,no,I'm B.Suarez,and I
can't authorize that sort of thing.

424
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,310
I don't know what to tell you.

425
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,650
Your name's all over this.

426
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,160
Uh... so how was the date?

427
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,890
I want details.And by "details,"
I mean very few details.

428
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,640
- I just ate.-
Well,it went--

429
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,010
so let me get to my real point-- did
you finish our assignment last night?

430
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:36,300
No.Marc,something happened
that distracted me.

431
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,700
Did he... touch you?

432
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:39,590
No.

433
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:44,400
Marc... I found $100,000
in my bank account.

434
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,490
- I don't know where it came from.
- What?

435
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:48,640
And accounting just told me that
I'm the one who authorized it?

436
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,980
I don't understand.

437
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,480
I think I could be in
some serious trouble here.

438
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,910
For what earthly reason would someone put
that much money into your bank account?

439
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,960
I don't know.

440
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,750
Connor,I need to talk to you.

441
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,940
Something very weird is going on.

442
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:07,930
what do you mean?

443
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,060
I mean someone transferred $100,000
into my bank account from meade.

444
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,410
Well,this is very serious,betty.

445
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,140
I know.Why would they do that?

446
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:24,440
The truth is,I heard about the transfer,and
I know you authorized it.I saw your name.

447
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,400
No,but I-I didn't authorize it.

448
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,380
I grew up poor,betty.I get it.

449
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,850
Your father's sick.You had to
move home to help with the bills.

450
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:34,060
No,I'm telling you that i didn't
take it.You have to believe me.

451
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,590
Oh,I believe you.

452
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,380
But the people who'll investigate this sort of thing--
that's just the way they're gonna see it,I'm afraid.

453
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:46,400
Did you put the money in there?

454
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,230
don't worry.I'm not gonna hurt you.

455
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,200
I didn't think you were until
you said,"I'm not gonna hurt you.

456
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:05,560
" See,betty,the thing is,I don't see why anyone
has to know about anyone stealing from the company.

457
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:11,530
You've been... stealing...

458
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:18,050
you did this because of what I
found in the budgets,didn't you?

459
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,750
Oh,you couldn't just drop it,could you?

460
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,140
No.You had to e-mail your friends

461
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,240
,ask them if they thought what was
going on at meade seemed suspicious.

462
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,570
How do you know about that?

463
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,060
I know a lot of things.

464
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,280
I've been watching you,betty suarez.

465
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:34,410
Now the way I see it,if you
keep quiet about this,well,

466
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,660
there's no reason why anyone should know
about the money in your account,either.

467
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,420
Well,you don't know me very well if
you think I would take your bribe.

468
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:44,580
Oh,but do you remember those papers
I gave you for daniel to sign?

469
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:48,320
The transfer to your account
was linked to daniel,as well.

470
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:52,740
Hey,look,it's very complicated,but
basically you'd both go to jail.

471
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,500
Actually,that's not that complicated.

472
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:57,330
Well,no one's gonna believe that
daniel is stealing from his own company.

473
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,790
Charles keating,bernie madoff?

474
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,760
Daniel certainly wouldn't be the first.

475
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,170
Why are you doing this?

476
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,890
I have my reasons.

477
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,110
And remember,if you're thinking
about telling anyone else,

478
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,910
there are a lot more people you
care about than just daniel meade.

479
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:21,160
And I can ruin any of their
lives with a couple of keystrokes.

480
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,390
I'm glad we could have this chat,betty.

481
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,550
You want some privacy,huh?

482
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,850
Wilhelmina,I have to tell you something.

483
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:02,810
It'S... bad.

484
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,430
Very bad?

485
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,140
Does someone need a spanking?

486
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,200
Willie,I'm serious.

487
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,110
I'm stealing from the company.

488
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:12,030
what?Is it a joke?

489
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,640
No.No joke.

490
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:18,980
I'm taking the money,I'm leaving the country,and
I want you and the baby to come with me.

491
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,680
Say something.

492
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,720
well,uh,what am  supposed to say?

493
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:34,060
Yesterday,you were gonna take me on a
trip.Today,you're telling me you're a thief.

494
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:37,190
- Willie-- connor,what else
have you lied to me about?

495
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,590
Okay,look,just let me explain.

496
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,750
I think you better explain.

497
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,520
All right.

498
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,710
Being nice to the daniel meades
of the world has served me well.

499
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:49,480
But I've had to hide how I really feel.

500
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,950
And how do you reay feel?

501
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,750
I hate the selfish son of a bitch.

502
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,680
Always have.I thought I could
get over it to work here.

503
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,460
And then he took from me.

504
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,900
What,he took from you?

505
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:02,970
Are you still hung up on that--
that kindergarten teacher of yours?

506
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,660
Look,it started with that,yeah.

507
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,520
And that's supposed to gain my sympathy?

508
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,130
Willie,I don't love her.I hate daniel.

509
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:17,400
When I found out about them,I came up with a plan to--
to steal everything from that selfish brat,ruin him.

510
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,710
You're talking about
stealing from meade.

511
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,280
I own half of meade!

512
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,540
Your baby owns half of meade.

513
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:27,930
And what,you think daniel wouldn't take
that from you in a second if he could?

514
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:31,640
Now you've wanted this company
since the moment you got here.

515
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:37,120
Now I'm telling you that I found
a way to take all of their money,

516
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,430
and I want to gi it to you...
because I love you,wilhelmina.

517
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,810
We have an opportunityere.

518
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:49,610
We can work for these people for the rest of
our lives,or we can have a future together...

519
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:54,960
just you and me and the baby.

520
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,380
I... I don't know what to say.

521
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,670
Say you'll come with me.

522
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:01,500
I've chartered a private jet.

523
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:05,590
Tonight... I want you to be on it.

524
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,710
Just promise me you'll consider it.

525
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,990
All right?

526
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,970
we need to talk.

527
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,090
This is crazy.

528
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,870
I cannot believe connor
would do this to us.

529
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:37,750
yeah,and if we go to the police,he's
made it so that we'll both be implicated.

530
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:39,090
Yeah,but we've got to tell someone.

531
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,150
I don't know,daniel.

532
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,960
Connor knew about the
e-mails I had sent.

533
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,860
He sort of threatened my family.

534
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:47,040
It was all kinda creepy.

535
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:49,070
You know,he's just
trying to buy some time.

536
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:51,190
I'm sure he just wants
to take the money and run.

537
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,560
So what are you saying?We
should go to the police?

538
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,830
I don't know.I've never
been embezzled from before.

539
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,290
I don't know who we can trust here.

540
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:01,040
Well,there's people who deal
with this sort of stuff,right?

541
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,260
you know what?I'm too sick to think.

542
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:07,340
Call my mom,tell her we gotta
meet and come up with a plan.

543
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,790
Willie,you're so mysterious.

544
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:14,810
"Grab all my things,bring
them to my apartment.

545
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,550
Buy yourself a prada belt.

546
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,220
" I threw that last one in
to see if you were listening.

547
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,900
Yes,yes,put it down there,please.

548
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:23,130
And you're not,which means I can
now admit that I bought the belt.

549
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:28,160
Marc,ever consider giving everything up?

550
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,860
Every ti I step on the scale.

551
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,180
willie,what's going on?

552
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,270
connor is robbing the company.

553
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,730
He's leaving the country,and
he asked me to go with him.

554
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,710
you're not joking.

555
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,910
No,I'm not,and I'm considering it.

556
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,440
You're what?

557
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,570
Marc,I love him.

558
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:56,880
- That may be,willie,but,seriously,"mode" is your life.
- I know.

559
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:02,240
Not to mention,there arr peotheople
who have put a lot into your successes.

560
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,130
I have never felt like this with anyone.

561
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,910
I've never had this in my life before.

562
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:08,530
Then again,let's not forget
about the other people.

563
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:12,100
What if this is my only chance at love?

564
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,850
Okay,I'm obviously bein
I'm talking about me.

565
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,470
Me,willie,how could you leave me?

566
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:20,600
If you had the chance to have
all the money you ever needed,

567
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:26,230
be with the person you loved for the
rest of your life,would you do it?

568
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,380
I don't know.

569
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:38,380
Willie,as your friend,I
don't know what to tell you.

570
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,950
I checked with security.

571
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,070
No one's seen connor
for hours.Or wilhelmina.

572
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,890
What,you think she's in on n this?

573
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:51,250
I did see connor with wilhelmina
right after he talked to me.

574
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,310
Well,daniel,are you really surprised?

575
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:56,160
I don't know.I just thought...
she owns half the company,so...

576
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,110
- maybe half isn't enough for her.
- Yeah.

577
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,770
Let's,uh,go into your office.I've
got some more bad news.

578
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,010
- What is it?
- Let's  into your office.

579
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,800
Mom,what?

580
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:15,370
As of noon today,all of the meade
accounts have beetotally cleared out.

581
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,760
And there's nothing left.

582
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,790
what's going on in there,anyway?

583
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:38,030
it's kinda serious,amanda.

584
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:42,510
oh,my god... is pink back?

585
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,390
No,wait,no wait,don't tell me.

586
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,850
I don't think I can handle it.

587
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,670
Is everything... gone?

588
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,530
Yes.

589
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,100
I had no idea she would
do something like this.

590
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,180
I thought she loved
"mode" more than anything.

591
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,140
I gave her everything,betty.

592
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,370
Marc,where's wilhelmina?

593
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,150
'Cause if you know where she
is,then we can just stop this.

594
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,670
you didn't get this from me.

595
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,770
What is this?

596
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,400
That's where she's meeting nnor.

597
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,650
If you hurry,you can still stop her.

598
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,210
oh,good god.

599
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,140
What do you clowns think you're doing?

600
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,190
Stopping you,wilhelmina.

601
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,100
Where's your baby?

602
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,810
Oh,she wouldn't bring her baby.

603
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:15,290
She only needed that child so she could
get her hands on the meade fortune.

604
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,730
You're all idiots.

605
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:18,850
You're gonna ruin everything.

606
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,340
I thought we agreed
not to call the police.

607
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,670
I didn't call them.

608
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,250
I did.

609
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,660
You don't know me at all.

610
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,780
sorry I'm not there,darling.

611
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,240
I,uh,I thought you might change your
mind,so I took an earlier flight.

612
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:56,520
connor,I...

613
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,930
so you chose your career,huh?

614
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:05,520
- I'm sorry.
- So am I.

615
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,510
I wish you'd chosen
differently,I really do.

616
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,590
I still love you.

617
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,570
Coffee?

618
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,330
I can't imagine what you
must be going through.

619
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,650
I don't need your sympathy.

620
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:53,720
No,I know.

621
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,820
But you loved him.

622
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:02,420
He asked me to choose--
him or my career.

623
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,820
I've spent my entire
life building my career.

624
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:16,180
In life,you have to make choices.

625
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,000
You can't have it all.

626
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:24,390
Well,I don't know if I believe that.I...

627
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:31,770
you are young,betty... but you
are a career girl just like me.

628
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,750
You'll see.

629
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,060
okay... go,go.

630
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:54,040
Justin,everyone in
L.A. Is wearing these.

631
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,960
Open it,open it.

632
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:05,080
I am a big fan... of
"bryant." He's the best.

633
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,090
okay,hilda,for you ooh!

634
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:09,110
Thank you.

635
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:12,610
a tracksuit?It's perfect.

636
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,720
And I am juicy.You are,mama.

637
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,360
mija!Elena's back.

638
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,940
And I brought presents.

639
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:25,180
I think I left yours in the kitchen.

640
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,680
Come on.

641
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,510
Here.

642
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,590
I figure a girl who's working all
the time could use a little fun.

643
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,430
Aw,sandals,that's great.

644
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:37,520
Thank you,ena.

645
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,000
Is everything okay?

646
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,920
Yeah.

647
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,810
No.

648
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,090
Uh,everything kinda
went wrong at work today.

649
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,630
Like,really wrong.

650
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,650
Like,"we might not have jobs" wrong.

651
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:53,630
Oh,my god,betty,I'm--
I'm so sorry.

652
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,490
Yeah.

653
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,110
Hey,elena,you've worked
most of your life,right?

654
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,160
Yeah,of course.

655
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,820
So did you ever feel like--
like you had to make a choice,

656
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:08,430
like... like work or a personal life?

657
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,200
What do you mean,like
you can only have one?

658
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:18,200
nena,if I thought like that,I
would've never met your father.

659
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,180
what did I miss?

660
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,600
okay,here's--here's-- I'll
tell you what I missed.

661
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,240
right here.

662
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,680
Right here is what I missed.

663
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,400
oh,molly.

664
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:59,410
I have had the most awful day.

665
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:04,880
what's going on?

666
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,660
You all right?

667
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,940
I have something to tell you.

668
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:14,700
I was gonna write you a note.

669
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:17,200
Is this about what you saw
on my computer--the rings?

670
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:20,220
- Daniel-- 'cause if you think we're
moving too fast,we can slow down.

671
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,600
- Daniel-- I just--I wanted
to get you something,you know,

672
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:26,010
to let you know we
have a future together.

673
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,200
Daniel,we don'T.

674
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:30,300
What are you talking about?

675
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:33,100
We don't have a future,because
I don't have one.

676
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:37,130
I'm sick,daniel.

677
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,440
It's cancer.

678
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:44,920
I beat it before,but
it's back and it's worse.

679
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:48,810
You know what?I put connor through
this a few years ago,and it was awful.

680
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,730
- I can't do that to you.
- No,no,wait,wait,wait.

681
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:53,200
What--what
are you saying?

682
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,720
I'm gonna go stay with my family.

683
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,800
I'm sorry,daniel.

684
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:58,960
No,no,you're leang?Don't
I get a say in this?

685
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,590
- Daniel--
no,no.

686
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,170
No,I want to be there
with you,to hp you.

687
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,080
You can't drop this in
my lap and just disappear.

688
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:05,870
That's not fair.

689
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,660
You don't know what you're asking me.

690
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,480
Please,molly-- you
know,I don't want you to.

691
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,420
