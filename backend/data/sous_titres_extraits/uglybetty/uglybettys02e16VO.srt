1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,900
<i>previously on "ugly betty"...</i>

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,500
that would
make her el you have a secret husband?

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,800
- i'm sick. 
- what are we talking about here?

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,700
$100,000 for
an experimental treatment.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,600
we need to find
a surrogate we can control,

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,900
- someone who's desperate for money.
- we're almost done. have a look.

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,300
i really like this girl.

8
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,600
- i take these. 
- if you think that's gonna make me

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,800
- want to be with you any
less, you're wrong. 
- really?

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,100
- will you move in with me?
- i'm so sorry.

11
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,800
- i really thought i was getting better. 
- i'm sorry, too.

12
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,300
charlie, i didn't even know
you were in town.

13
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,400
charlie's not feeling well,

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,300
so i'm gonna have
to take her to the doctor.

15
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,100
- hi. 
- i thought you were at the doctor.

16
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,200
i think charlie was just trying
to ruin my night with betty.

17
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,100
i love you.
that's all that matters to me.

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,000
* i'll be loving you forever *

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,500
everything's so nice
and romantic.

20
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,700
to us, betty.

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,400
to us,

22
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,400
and to making the most of
the time we have left together.

23
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,000
yeah.

24
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,100
uh-oh. am i too early?

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
i am so sorry.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,500
<i>i swear, i stayed out
as long as i could.</i>

27
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,600
really? 'cause you only left
15 minutes ago.

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,800
oh, i had no idea.
i can't wear a watch

29
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,200
because my arms are so bloated
from carrying your child, so...

30
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,400
oh, whoa.

31
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,200
what? are you okay?

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,100
oh, whoa, whoa.
um, so-so.

33
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,100
i just think my blood sugar
might be low.

34
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,100
- what do you need?
- some food.

35
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,400
- uh...
- oh, this will work.

36
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,600
what? uh...
mmm.

37
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,300
mmm. mmm.

38
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,200
she's a monster.

39
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,000
<i>i mean, we're at the movies,
she calls ten times.</i>

40
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,200
we're at dinner,

41
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,200
emergency text-
"i need flaxseed right away."

42
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,900
pregnant women
are difficult.

43
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,200
oh, please.
we're bitches.

44
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,600
plus she also
has it in for you,

45
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,800
'cause you did
steal her man.

46
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,700
wait.
she cheated on henry.

47
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,200
<i>she didn't love him.
i love him,</i>

48
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,100
and i've got three weeks
left with him,

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,400
and she is making it impossible
for us to spend time together.

50
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,800
well, what about lunchtime?
oh, i know.

51
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,800
you could rent one of these
"by the hour" hotel rooms.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
free movies.

53
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,000
that's a good idea.

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
ooh.

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,200
not the smutty hotel room,
the lunch hour...

56
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,700
and i think charlie is busy
in her prenatal yoga class.

57
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,300
mm. that reminds me.

58
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,500
i've got the baby doctor
this afternoon.

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,400
it's the end
of the first trimester.

60
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,700
i just hope the doctor's
not gonna say

61
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,600
it's okay to go runnin'
or swimmin' or something.

62
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,000
hello?
are you listening to me?

63
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,300
yep-baby doctor,
trimester, hate exercising...

64
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,600
i have
lunch plans with henry.

65
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,600
where is she?

66
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,500
eating with betty.

67
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,400
oh, great.

68
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,000
we need the baby
to be healthy, not flabby.

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,400
don't worry.

70
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,800
we'll put it on a juice fast
the minute it pops out.

71
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,800
oh. listen, everything's gonna
check out okay with the doctor,

72
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,900
and then monday,
all hell will break loose

73
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,900
as the exiled queens
of "mode"...

74
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,900
- make their triumphant return. 
- how are we doing on the press coverage?

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,900
i've pitched it

76
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,900
as a major
fashion world announcement,

77
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,200
so all the women-friendly
networks are in a lather.

78
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,900
"the view" is doing
a special live broadcast,

79
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,800
which they
never could've done

80
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,600
if potty-mouthed rosie
was still around.

81
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,700
good.
i want this moment.

82
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,300
i need this moment.

83
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,000
- all eyes on me...
- me.

84
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,000
<i>you.</i>

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,600
as i march up the steps
of the meade building.

86
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,400
it'll be
the greatest comeback since...

87
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,300
jesus.

88
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,300
blasphemous...

89
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,200
and sexy.

90
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,000
hey, what's goin' on?

91
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,500
uh, thought we had
a meeting with a photographer.

92
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,400
we did. amelie bissou,
she canceled.

93
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,000
photographers...
they are so flaky, huh?

94
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,300
yeah,
this flaky photographer

95
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,600
won't come out
of her bathroom

96
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,700
because someone...
who works at this magazine

97
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,400
slept with her
and never called.

98
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,700
what a jerk, huh?

99
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,400
oh, no. sh-she never gave me
her number.

100
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,600
ever since renee, you have
been on a downward spiral-

101
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,900
- out every night, missing meetings... 
- we think you may need some 
professional help.

102
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,600
you mean like a shrink?
no way. no. i'm fine.

103
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,300
the woman you fell in love with
almost killed your assistant

104
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,800
and burned
your apartment down.

105
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,500
you are not fine.
you need to talk to someone.

106
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,100
another voice could help.

107
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,510


108
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,510


109
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,300
entonces...

110
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,600
<i>papi, i love you,
but your handwriting stinks.</i>

111
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,900
what does this say?

112
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,200
well, there was a message
on the machine from coach diaz.

113
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,300
<i>he wants to talk
to you about justin...</i>

114
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,400
and this is perfect penmanship.
you need your eyes checked.

115
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,200
justin!
what does coach diaz want?

116
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,000
remember when i told you
that coach diaz is a total jerk

117
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,600
- and the meanest gym teacher
i've ever had? 
- yeah, you told me.

118
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,600
- you told everybody.
- now he's gonna fail me in gym.

119
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,900
- what about all those notes i wrote
excusing you from class? 
- he doesn't care.

120
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,000
he said that every student has
to fulfill a "p.e. requirement."

121
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,500
<i>well, every student should...
but not you.</i>

122
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,000
you're special.

123
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,800
coach diaz does not get me.

124
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,400
well, don't you worry.
he is gonna get you,

125
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,500
because my taxes pay his salary,
which means i'm his boss. 'kay.

126
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,000
hilda, i don't think
you paid any taxes last year.

127
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,900
so amelie bissou
is out of the bathroom,

128
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,800
and the photo shoot
is back on.

129
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,600
- that's great. 
- it only took an
hour on the phone with her agent,

130
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,500
tripling her fee,

131
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,700
<i>and you are not allowed
anywhere near the photo studio</i>

132
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,800
- on the day.
- betty, you're the best.

133
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,700
daniel, i know
that part of my job

134
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,900
is following you around
and cleaning up your messes,

135
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,900
but ever since renee,

136
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,600
there just isn't
a pooper-scooper big enough.

137
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,500
- you've been talking to my mom and sister?
- as your unofficial, occasional thepist,

138
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,500
i think that it would be

139
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,700
a really good idea
for you to see somebody.

140
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,400
i am not gonna go see
a therapist.

141
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,400
- i am doing fine on my own, betty.
- according to reliable internet sources,

142
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,300
the definition
of an insane person-

143
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,000
"one who or that which
performs the same actions

144
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,800
over and over again
expecting different results."

145
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,000
insanity or optimism.

146
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,400
if you want things
in your life to be different,

147
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,100
you must do things differently.

148
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,300
therefore, if your instincts
are telling you

149
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,700
<i>not to go to therapy,
then go to therapy.</i>

150
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,600
your appointment's at 2:00
with dr. wallace.

151
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,400
i didn't say yes.

152
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,300
henry, you ready
for our lunch date?

153
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,400
um, i would be,
but charlie called,

154
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,000
and her
yoga partner canceled.

155
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
so i have to-

156
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
betty?

157
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,400
- you do realize she's doing
this on purpose, don't you? 
- yes.

158
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,100
<i>- she's trying to get in between us because 
she hates me. 
- no. no, no, no. she doesn't hate you.</i>

159
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,800
look, betty, i'm sorry.

160
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,600
- i guess i hoped that you guys
could be friends. 
- friends? friends?

161
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,000
how can i be friends
with her

162
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,100
when she is always trying
to get in between us,

163
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,100
- over and over and over again?
- i know.

164
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,500
she will never stop...

165
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,200
 -unless...
- unless what?

166
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,900
unless
i do things differently.

167
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
hi.

168
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
where's henry?

169
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,400
he can't make it,

170
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,200
so i'm here
to be your yoga partner

171
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,100

175
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,000
betty, no.

176
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,600
we can't be
yoga partners or friends.

177
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,800
charlie, don't you remember
when we first met?

178
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,100
i bought you a brownie.

179
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,200
charlie, we could go back to
those times, the brownie times.

180
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,500
look, brownie!

181
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,800
well, i've got
gestational diabetes,

182
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,000
so i could die if i ate that,
okay? but thank you.

183
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,600
welcome to baby bump yoga.

184
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,500
let's start
with downward dog.

185
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,000
so you're
having a natural childbirth.

186
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,700
- is that like a pool or a bathtub or
- go away. now.

187
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,800
shh!

188
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,600
good job, guys.

189
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,700
excuse me.
are you coach diaz?

190
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,900
yeah. can i help you?

191
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,300
you're the gym teacher?

192
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,200
yes, and you are?

193
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,700
- i am justin suarez' mother.
- i guess you heard he's failing.

194
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,500
i did hear, and i think
there's been a big mistake,

195
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,900
because i have been
sending notes

196
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,900
asking that justin be excused
from p.e., so...

197
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,000
you know, tell me,
when you were in school,

198
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,200
did you get excused
from math class with a note

199
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,000
- or english class? 
- not officially because i would skip those,

200
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,100
but this is not math...
or english.

201
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,100
well, i believe
fitness and exercise

202
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,400
- are just as important. 
- yes, but my justin is not really an athlete.

203
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
well, luckily you don't have
to be an athlete

204
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,600
to be in my class.

205
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,200
he just needs to show up,
make an effort.

206
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,000
okay, let's just...
get right to it.

207
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,800
if you fail justin,

208
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,600
i'm gonna talk
to the principal.

209
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,300
great. you should
swing by his office,

210
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,900
- schedule an appointment.
- hey, i am not joking here.

211
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,200
oh, neither am i.

212
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,300
ms. suarez, i have a master's
in wellness training.

213
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,500
i just happen to believe

214
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,700
that everyone can benefit
from a gym class, even you.

215
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,500
whoa. what is that
supposed to mean?

216
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,800
do not turn your back on me.

217
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,600
this is not over.
i pay your salary, coach diaz!

218
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,600
you know what?

219
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,500
i read that babies
born in water

220
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,700
have higher i.q.s
than the babies-

221
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,700
oh, my god. please stop.

222
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,300
- okay, partners. grab your mommy's waist. 
- don't touch me. don't touch me.

223
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,600
don't touch me.
don't touch me. don't touch me.

224
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
- betty, don't touch me!
- but that's what she told me-

225
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,900
okay, you two
with the bad energy-out!

226
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,100
you're still touching me.

227
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,800
i'm sorry.

228
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,400
i know that your situation
at the moment is not ideal.

229
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,600
oh. oh,
it is far from ideal.

230
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,300
this weekend i was supposed
to be at home in tucson

231
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,300
having a baby shower
with my friends,

232
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,800
- so unless you want to-
- throw you a baby shower?

233
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
- what? - wasn't that what
you were just about to say?

234
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,700
- unless i want to throw you a baby shower?
- do you want to throw me a baby shower?

235
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,300
- um, yes.
- when?

236
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,900
tomorrow.

237
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,600
wow. you're not at all
what i expected.

238
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,900
when i heard
the name "dr. wallace,"

239
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,000
i thought
it would be a guy.

240
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,900
but then i thought,
no, don't be closed-minded.

241
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,300
it could be
an old lady, too.

242
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,300
- so what exactly are you hoping
to get out of therapy? 
- a date?

243
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,800
have you been depressed?

244
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,500
nothing a drink with you
wouldn't cure.

245
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,200
- get out.
- wha-seriously?

246
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,500
i'm not in the business
of wasting my time with patients

247
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,400
who aren't prepared
to take therapy seriously.

248
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,500
when you're ready
to face up to your emotions

249
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,800
and talk about them
like an adult, you can return.

250
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,500
until then, good-bye.

251
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
so?

252
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,600
everything's fine. the fetus
is healthy and growing,

253
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,700
- and you'll be giving birth in six months. 
- so i can go back to work?

254
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,100
absolutely. you can work.
you can exercise-

255
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,700
let's just stick
with the work.

256
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,700
so is it safe to start
telling people we're pregnant?

257
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,800
sure. tell whoever you want-
friends, family...

258
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,300
- 400 members of the news media. 
- thank you, dr. weiss.

259
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,900
christina, put your muumuu on.
we'll meet you in the lobby.

260
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,800
- oh, do you want a video of
the sonogram? 
- uh, don't care.

261
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,300
marc,
call barbara at p.m.k.-

262
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,900
- pretty barbara, not
freckly barbara. 
- on it.

263
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,500
quite a driven woman,
isn't she?

264
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,600
she's a bitch.

265
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,400
that, too.

266
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,800
oh. why does that say
"meade/slater baby"?

267
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,200
don't worry.
that's just for your file.

268
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,800
i'm sure
it must be strange

269
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,500
carrying the child
of a dead man.

270
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,400
betty.

271
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,400
- oh, henry.
- hey.

272
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
guess what?

273
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,400
for her shower, charlie wants
her favorite tamales

274
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,300
- from this place in tucson, and i
tracked them down. 
- wait, her shower?

275
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,200
oh, yeah, i'm throwing
charlie a baby shower,

276
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,400
so that she'll see me
as a friend

277
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,200
and let you and i
spend more time together.

278
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,700
- you would do that?
- i am doing it.

279
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,100
- so get this-so escobar's-
do you know the place? 
- yeah.

280
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,000
well, they won't ship
their tamales overnight-

281
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,900
- ruins the flavor-so i have to buy 
them a seat on a plane. 
- it sounds like that's a lot of work.

282
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,600
it is, but i don't mind.
it's for us,

283
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,600
and when you want
something bad enough,

284
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,500
you work harder.

285
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,600
oh.

286
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,500
oh, thank you
for calling me back.

287
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,000
it's escobar's. i have
to take this. oh, yeah.

288
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,100
so, um,
my first question is,

289
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,000
can the tamales fly coach?

290
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,400
look,
i'm sorry about before.

291
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,400
it's just, i...
i like to flirt.

292
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,600
and what do you get
out of flirting?

293
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,100
i don't know.

294
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,200
- is it approval?
- yeah, i guess.

295
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,900
feels good to be wanted?

296
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,800
guess i need that right now.

297
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,600
why?

298
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,500
there was this woman...

299
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,100
i just wanted so badly
for things to be different,

300
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,100
for meo...
find something... deeper.

301
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,900
instead i ended up
with nothing.

302
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
i think this is something
we should explore.

303
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,400
what is keeping her?

304
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,100
i'm due at sergio rossi
to pick out new work shoes.

305
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,100
oh, these scottish types-
no concern for time.

306
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,200
if tilda swinton says 7:30,

307
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,200
<i>- do not expect her before 10:00. 
- christina.</i>

308
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,200
<i>johan, pleascome to
the outpatient surgical center.</i>

309
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,800
where is she?

310
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,500
maybe the bathroom?
ugh. these scottish types.

311
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,000
if tilda swinton
says she has to pee-

312
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,200
no. she knows
it's bradford's baby.

313
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,400
she's gone.

314
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,900
they're arriving
at laguardia on flight 47?

315
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,400
perfect. a messenger
will be waiting. thank you.

316
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,200
is it crazy that i'm flying
in tamales from tucson

317
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,300
<i>because that's what charlie
wants to eat at her baby shower?</i>

318
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,600
- okay, stop begging. i'll come. 
- what?

319
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,200
- huh? i didn't say anything. 
- you just said you'd come to the shower.

320
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,200
- why would i say i'd come to the shower? 
- i don't know, amanda.

321
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,500
do you want
to come to the shower?

322
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,200
do i want to come
to the shower

323
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,600
for someone
i don't even know?

324
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,400
why would i do that?
what are you serving?

325
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,200
well, tamales, a bunch
of fun little appetizers,

326
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,100
and my dad
is making empanadas.

327
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,600
okay, well, that's crazy.

328
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,900
don't cancel the shower
just because i'm not coming.

329
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,300
let me see
what i can do.

330
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,900
he gave you detention?

331
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,200
<i>gym detention.</i>

332
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,900
what is "gym detention"?

333
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,500
it got invented today
for me.

334
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,400
i had to organize
the equipment room.

335
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,900
there were balls and bats.

336
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,900
it was like a nightmare
that would never end.

337
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
- this is all your fault. 
- well, i was just trying to help you out.

338
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,400
you came to my school
and yelled at my teacher.

339
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,100
- what did you think would happen?
- okay, look. i can fix this.

340
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,200
please don't.

341
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,200
he might make me quarterback
of the hockey team or something.

342
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,600
hey. what if i change
my approach?

343
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,500
oh, my god, mom. no.

344
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,300
this is all getting
very "sweeney todd" now.

345
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,000
so, christina,

346
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,900
i would love
to sit and chat

347
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,700
and clear up
this whole misunderstanding.

348
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,000
call me.

349
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,600
i'm worried sick about you.

350
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,200
even i didn't believe that.

351
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,200
well, you are
your toughest critic.

352
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,600
what a screwup.

353
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,200
remind me to get that
stupid doctor's license revoked.

354
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,200
done. by the time
we're through with him,

355
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,100
he'll be neutering dogs
in buffalo.

356
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,100
this is bad, marc.

357
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,600
if she disappears,

358
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,100
if that baby disappears,
we've got nothing.

359
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,500
no baby means
no return to "mode,"

360
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,700
means no future
for either of us.

361
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,900
oh, willie, why can't things
just be easy for once?

362
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,400
on the surface,
our plans are rock solid,

363
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,100
and we're both so attractive.

364
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,400
perhaps that's our curse,
marc-

365
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,400
that and our humanity.

366
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,900
i was
so stupid to trust her!

367
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,900
there's no way
you could've known.

368
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:12,100
stuart, this is the worst thing
that could happen.

369
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,900
oh.

370
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,300
or is it the best thing?

371
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,900
no, i'm serious.

372
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,200
we know that she was willing to
pay all that money for this...

373
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,400
- yeah.
- enough for my operation.

374
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,100
so?

375
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,200
so maybe she'll pay more.

376
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,300
you're thinking she's got you.
i say you've got her.

377
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,300
- when that thing inside you
- stuart that "thing" is going to be a baby.

378
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,400
well, she needs it,

379
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,700
and when
people need something,

380
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,800
that makes them weak.

381
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,800
yeah.

382
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,100
okay, what just happened?

383
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,500
i looked over at you,

384
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,300
- and there was a silence, and 
the next thing i know
- you kissed me.

385
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,300
- no, no, no, you kissed me. 
doctor, you lunged at me
- because you seduced me.

386
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,100
- i didn't do anything.
- oh, you can't help it.

387
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,000
- you're a seducer. that's what you do.
- but it's not working for me anymore.

388
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,400
who are you calling?

389
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,400
my shrink.

390
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,700
but i-look, i'm so sorry.

391
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:18,000
- i- i promise, i'll pay you for this. 
- and now i feel like a whore. super.

392
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:22,800
- derrick, i need to see you right away. 
i'm coming over now. 
- i'm the one who needs help.

393
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,500
- you showed me this. what am i
supposed to do now? 
- i don't know.

394
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,200
you're not my problem anymore.
you're an animal.

395
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,400
leave, please.

396
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,200
go out, find women
and ruin their lives.

397
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,400
uh, listen, ms. suarez,

398
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,600
it's very nice of you
to offer to cut my hair,

399
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,500
but i'm happy
just to talk about justin.

400
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,700
it's-it's my job.

401
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,600
oh, please, it's nothing.
it's nothing. here.

402
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:49,100
it's just my way of saying
we got off on the wrong foot.

403
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,800
you know,
and i-i didn't mean anything

404
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,100
about you needing
a gym class.

405
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,300
you got a great body.

406
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,800
not that i was looking
at your body.

407
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,600
oh, yeah, right. right.

408
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,000
i mean, you're the parent,
i'm the teacher.

409
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,800
i mean, i'm the parent.

410
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,000
oh, gosh, sorry. i just-
i get a little bit worked up

411
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,400
- over justin sometimes. 
- hey, don't worry about it. 
it's your kid. i get it.

412
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,000
look, if it makes
you feel any better,

413
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,800
i swear to you
that i would never do anything

414
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,100
to embarrass him.

415
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,700
thank you. that does
make me feel better.

416
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,300
mm.

417
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,800
you were gonna-

418
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,800
oh, yeah.

419
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,900
okay.
this is a great place.

420
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,900
- oh, thank you. yeah, we just o
- oh!

421
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,700
aah!

422
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,800
- <i>oh, my god! let me see.
- no! uh, no. tha-i-it's okay.</i>

423
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,200
- let me get some alcohol.
- oh, wow.

424
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,700
- here.
- that's nail polish remover.

425
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,800
- yeah, but it-it-it sanitizes. 
- it's okay. don't worry about it. 
i'm fine, okay?

426
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,000
- i'm just gonna go bleed at home. 
- oh.

427
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,600
oh, man.

428
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,500
oh. ugh. hilda.

429
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,500
um, no. no, i'm looking
at the plates right now.

430
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,700
they are definitely not
what i ordered.

431
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,200
these have father time
on them-

432
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,800
father time, not a baby.

433
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,100
he has a beard.

434
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,000
look, i'm sorry
i'm being such a pain.

435
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,800
i am generally
a much nicer person.

436
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,800
i just-

437
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,500
my fault.

438
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,500
i know.

439
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,500
i'm sorry, mrs. meade.

440
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,400
oh, betty, it's fine.

441
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,500
it's a purse, not a baby.

442
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,600
once in nantucket,

443
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,800
i dropped daniel
in a bucket of ice,

444
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,300
landed on his head.

445
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,000
okay.

446
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,900
uh, well,
he should be fine now.

447
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,900
i got him
to see the therapist.

448
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,800
- i heard. thank you for that.
- oh, don't worry about it.

449
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,400
just another one
of the many things

450
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,500
i had to do today.

451
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,400
- betty, when are you
going to stop? 
- i can't.

452
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,800
i agreed to throw
this last-minute baby shower

453
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,500
- for charlie, henry's pregnant ex-girlfriend. 
- oh, right. that ordeal.

454
00:20:02,362 --> 00:20:04,113
something i have to do
to spend time with henry.

455
00:20:04,113 --> 00:20:07,862
i mean, he's leaving
in three weeks and-aah. ow!

456
00:20:08,812 --> 00:20:10,222
why did you do that?

457
00:20:10,222 --> 00:20:13,599
to get your attention.
wake up, betty.

458
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,133
this relationship you are in
has no future,

459
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:18,067
and the sooner
you realize that,

460
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,466
<i>the sooner you'll get back
to living your life,</i>

461
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:23,050
instead of planning
babyhowers

462
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,866
for your boyfriend's
ex-girlfriends.

463
00:20:32,738 --> 00:20:35,533
henry, it's over.

464
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:37,866
ugh. it just
doesn't sound right.

465
00:20:37,933 --> 00:20:41,112
i mean, this is henry.
i don't want it to be over.

466
00:20:41,112 --> 00:20:43,300
this jacket makes me
look like a nerd.

467
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,253
why do you need to apologize
to this guy in person?

468
00:20:46,253 --> 00:20:49,237
i can't just call
coach diaz.

469
00:20:49,237 --> 00:20:51,706
i nearly maimed him
for life.

470
00:20:51,706 --> 00:20:54,613
and justin needs
to pass gym, so...

471
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,862
now i look
like a slutty nerd.

472
00:20:57,862 --> 00:21:00,487
<i>i don't think this
has anything to do with justin.</i>

473
00:21:00,487 --> 00:21:02,690
what are you talking about?
oh, come on, hilda.

474
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:05,050
<i>first, you pick
a fight with this guy.</i>

475
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,738
then you invited him over
for a haircut?

476
00:21:07,738 --> 00:21:08,925
you know what this is?

477
00:21:08,925 --> 00:21:12,660
<i>this is hector reale
from ninth grade all over again.</i>

478
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,691
that is ridiculous.

479
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:17,925
i did not give hector reale a
haircut. i know what you gave him.

480
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:19,441
come on, hilda.

481
00:21:19,441 --> 00:21:22,159
you totally like
this coach guy.

482
00:21:22,453 --> 00:21:24,862
what's his name?
coach diaz.

483
00:21:24,862 --> 00:21:26,268
what's his first name?

484
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,738
coach?

485
00:21:28,738 --> 00:21:29,503
well,
you should fix that,

486
00:21:29,503 --> 00:21:30,362
'cause it's gonna sound
really weird

487
00:21:30,362 --> 00:21:31,284
when you guys are kissing

488
00:21:31,284 --> 00:21:34,425
and you're all like,
"ooh, coach. ooh."

489
00:21:34,691 --> 00:21:36,863
shut up! stop talking
about it. "oh, coach."

490
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:37,690
there's not gonna be
any kissing.

491
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:40,800
<i>ay, you're getting me
all freaked out. hilda.</i>

492
00:21:41,565 --> 00:21:44,331
i don't know, betty.
i just-

493
00:21:44,331 --> 00:21:46,487
i felt something
when i was talking to him,

494
00:21:46,487 --> 00:21:50,316
and it was just
the first time since santos.

495
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,425
you have a crush...

496
00:21:53,863 --> 00:21:54,268
mm.

497
00:21:54,344 --> 00:21:57,613
and i have henry.

498
00:21:58,063 --> 00:21:59,612
check us out.

499
00:22:02,987 --> 00:22:04,300
who is that?
i don't know.

500
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,925
it's-it's not time.
we're not ready.

501
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:11,925
we need to talk.

502
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,565
all we've been doing lately
is obsessing

503
00:22:15,565 --> 00:22:17,738
about how little time
we have ft together.

504
00:22:18,687 --> 00:22:21,238
i know, and it's horrible,

505
00:22:21,238 --> 00:22:23,339
and it so stressful
for the both of us,

506
00:22:23,405 --> 00:22:24,206
and i-i don't-i-

507
00:22:24,206 --> 00:22:25,999
that's why i'm here.

508
00:22:26,815 --> 00:22:29,785
i think there's only
one thing to do. oh, god.

509
00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:33,138
we have to
stay together forever.

510
00:22:33,205 --> 00:22:36,105
oh! that's not what
i thought you were gonna say,

511
00:22:36,172 --> 00:22:38,105
but i like it! go on.

512
00:22:38,172 --> 00:22:40,439
my cousin lance just got
a new job at transwest airlines.

513
00:22:40,505 --> 00:22:42,378
he says i can use
his friends and family discount.

514
00:22:42,378 --> 00:22:44,175
i have to do his taxes
for 20 years,

515
00:22:44,175 --> 00:22:46,238
but i can see you every
other weekend. really?

516
00:22:46,238 --> 00:22:49,675
and-and once in a while, you can come out
and see me. or we could meet in the middle.

517
00:22:49,675 --> 00:22:52,812
yes. yes.
god, i love you.

518
00:22:52,862 --> 00:22:56,031
the middle just happens
to be springfield, missouri,

519
00:22:56,081 --> 00:22:58,753
a.k.a.
queen city of the ozarks,

520
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:00,425
renowned throughout america
for having

521
00:23:00,425 --> 00:23:02,300
the most varied weather in
the natn. i love weather.

522
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,644
i know you do.

523
00:23:03,644 --> 00:23:04,425
and in the meantime,

524
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:07,315
we can call or-or e-mail
or video chat.

525
00:23:07,315 --> 00:23:09,800
it-it's the 21st century.

526
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,238
we can see each other
every day if we want to.

527
00:23:12,238 --> 00:23:16,050
wow. you really thought
about this.

528
00:23:17,156 --> 00:23:18,999
you're the most important thing
in my life.

529
00:23:30,313 --> 00:23:33,175
oh, god. is 11:00.
charlie-her baby shower.

530
00:23:33,175 --> 00:23:35,144
oh. i guess it's too late
to call it off.

531
00:23:35,144 --> 00:23:38,269
are you kidding?
now it's even more important.

532
00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:40,707
charlie will be
part of my life forever.

533
00:23:42,656 --> 00:23:45,675
charlie,
welcome to your baby shower.

534
00:23:45,765 --> 00:23:46,488
henry.

535
00:23:46,488 --> 00:23:48,940
i was just leaving.
you ladies have fun.

536
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:50,737
bye.

537
00:23:54,344 --> 00:23:56,581
i'm late because
your directions were messed up.

538
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,660
oh.

539
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,738
wow. i don't remember
your house being so small.

540
00:24:00,738 --> 00:24:02,847
something smells
really funny.

541
00:24:04,438 --> 00:24:05,925
come on in.

542
00:24:11,266 --> 00:24:12,878
stuart.

543
00:24:17,203 --> 00:24:19,050
hello, christina.

544
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,487
how did you find me?

545
00:24:21,487 --> 00:24:24,644
i called her. it was the
right thing, christina.

546
00:24:24,644 --> 00:24:26,362
you don't have
a lot of options.

547
00:24:26,362 --> 00:24:28,737
nyet options.

548
00:24:28,737 --> 00:24:31,204
but what stuart was
savvy enough to recognize

549
00:24:31,254 --> 00:24:33,582
is you do have power.

550
00:24:33,582 --> 00:24:37,534
i need this baby, christina,

551
00:24:37,534 --> 00:24:41,503
and i will pay to ensure
you follow through with this.

552
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:44,362
what do you want?

553
00:24:44,425 --> 00:24:45,500
nothing.

554
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,675
christina-

555
00:24:46,675 --> 00:24:47,941
no. don't.

556
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,972
she'll be back.

557
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:59,129
she has nowhere else to go.

558
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:03,269
thank you.

559
00:25:07,128 --> 00:25:08,112
thanks.

560
00:25:12,488 --> 00:25:14,750
welcome... amanda.

561
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,612
calm down. i can only stay
for, like, five minutes.

562
00:25:17,612 --> 00:25:19,999
i have a million things
to do today.

563
00:25:21,406 --> 00:25:22,612
what's that?

564
00:25:22,806 --> 00:25:25,362
uh, shrimp empanadas
in mole sauce.

565
00:25:25,362 --> 00:25:26,456
my dad made 'em
this morning.

566
00:25:26,456 --> 00:25:27,612
mm.

567
00:25:28,863 --> 00:25:31,675
it's pretty good.
wish i didn't have to leave.

568
00:25:32,328 --> 00:25:32,800
is there more?

569
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,800
betty? hey, betty?

570
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,362
yes?

571
00:25:37,315 --> 00:25:39,363
what is that?

572
00:25:39,422 --> 00:25:42,300
<i>oh, uh,
that is a piAta.</i>

573
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,440
i thought it would be really fun. well,
the plastic lining chokes the birds

574
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,941
that feed at the landfills.
oh, uh-

575
00:25:47,941 --> 00:25:48,566
and i'm sorry,

576
00:25:48,566 --> 00:25:49,988
but are these vegetables
fresh cut?

577
00:25:49,988 --> 00:25:52,221
because they sure
don't look like it.

578
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,125
um, well,
i could cut some now.

579
00:25:55,175 --> 00:25:56,050
that'd be great.

580
00:26:00,925 --> 00:26:02,394
why is everyone
so fat at this party?

581
00:26:04,925 --> 00:26:08,500
betty, you don't seem
like you're having much fun.

582
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:11,769
yeah, well,
i just gotta let that go,

583
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:15,347
because i'm the one who decided
to throw charlie this party.

584
00:26:15,347 --> 00:26:16,425
besides, henry and i
have found a way

585
00:26:16,425 --> 00:26:18,425
to make it work
long-distance.

586
00:26:18,425 --> 00:26:20,753
long-distance?

587
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,363
dad, i know that voice.

588
00:26:22,363 --> 00:26:24,999
the skeptical,
i- know-better-than-you voice

589
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:27,250
that you trot out every time
you think i'm making a mistake,

590
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,563
and hilda used to get it
more often.

591
00:26:29,613 --> 00:26:31,613
look, i'm sure
you have a great plan.

592
00:26:31,613 --> 00:26:34,675
all i'm saying is that
long-distance is no replacement

593
00:26:34,675 --> 00:26:36,488
for spending time together.

594
00:26:36,488 --> 00:26:38,956
henry will be back and forth
all the time.

595
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,143
he said i was the most
important thing in his life.

596
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:50,784
<i>amor, the thing is,
he's having a baby,</i>

597
00:26:50,784 --> 00:26:52,237
and once you're a parent,

598
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:54,656
nothing's ever the same.

599
00:26:54,706 --> 00:26:57,175
it'll be hard work,
but we can do it.

600
00:26:59,562 --> 00:27:01,812
daniel.
can i borrow some money?

601
00:27:01,862 --> 00:27:02,987
what are you doing here?

602
00:27:02,987 --> 00:27:06,312
uh, therapy, uh,
didn't exactly work out.

603
00:27:06,362 --> 00:27:10,112
uh, y-yeah. i can see that.
what happened?

604
00:27:10,112 --> 00:27:12,613
i slept with her.
then i went out.

605
00:27:12,613 --> 00:27:14,437
i met this girl at a club,

606
00:27:14,487 --> 00:27:17,062
went back to her apartment,
where i met her roommate,

607
00:27:17,112 --> 00:27:18,675
who took me out
to another club,

608
00:27:18,675 --> 00:27:20,550
where i met
these russian ballerinas.

609
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,237
they turned out
to be strippers,

610
00:27:22,237 --> 00:27:24,613
and i woke up
somewhere in queens,

611
00:27:24,613 --> 00:27:26,800
um, and i lost my wallet.
betty.

612
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,738
christina. um, i really
need to talk to you.

613
00:27:29,738 --> 00:27:31,863
um-
is there soy milk?

614
00:27:31,863 --> 00:27:35,878
and why do these plates have an
old man on them? ugh. uh, um, okay.

615
00:27:35,878 --> 00:27:37,999
uh, daniel,
borrow cab fare from my dad.

616
00:27:37,999 --> 00:27:39,999
dad, go to the market.
get soy milk.

617
00:27:39,999 --> 00:27:42,487
christina, upstairs now.

618
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,738
sounds like you had,
uh, quite a night.

619
00:27:48,047 --> 00:27:48,800
yeah.

620
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,188
wanna take a walk?
sure.

621
00:27:52,472 --> 00:27:54,160
good. come on.

622
00:27:56,203 --> 00:27:58,125
and i-i don't know
what to do.

623
00:27:58,175 --> 00:27:59,999
betty, she's done this
to me before,

624
00:27:59,999 --> 00:28:01,957
and i can't believe
i've been so stupid.

625
00:28:01,957 --> 00:28:05,425
okay, first of all,
stop blaming yourself.

626
00:28:05,425 --> 00:28:06,753
ohh.
this is wilhelmina.

627
00:28:06,753 --> 00:28:08,703
this is what she does.
she uses people.

628
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:11,269
i know, i know,
and that i can cope with.

629
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:15,675
but this time, it's not just me.
there's gonna be a baby.

630
00:28:15,675 --> 00:28:18,613
christina, there is a difference
between you and her.

631
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:19,925
oh, is there?

632
00:28:19,925 --> 00:28:23,316
<i>yes,
you are a good person.</i>

633
00:28:23,316 --> 00:28:24,988
really?

634
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:27,112
really.

635
00:28:27,112 --> 00:28:30,550
betty!
are there tamales or not?

636
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,999
ugh.

637
00:28:32,562 --> 00:28:34,719
i'll be right there!

638
00:28:35,063 --> 00:28:36,487
she is annoying.

639
00:28:40,688 --> 00:28:41,500
you know what they say

640
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,562
about pregnant women
being so beautiful?

641
00:28:44,612 --> 00:28:46,237
well, i have a question.

642
00:28:46,237 --> 00:28:48,175
what if u're already
really beautiful?

643
00:28:48,175 --> 00:28:50,800
is it possible
to become too beautiful?

644
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,800
i mean, is it dangerous?
could you hurt someone?

645
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,160
ladies, straight
from tucson, arizona-

646
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,050
especially for charlie-

647
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:01,988
escobar's famous
green corn tamales!

648
00:29:01,988 --> 00:29:02,862
ooh!

649
00:29:02,999 --> 00:29:04,471
no. charlie?

650
00:29:07,739 --> 00:29:09,272
here. take that.

651
00:29:13,187 --> 00:29:14,487
this isn't the right tamale.

652
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:17,050
yes, it is.
i think i would know, betty.

653
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:19,441
those are from escobar's.
they wouldn't even ship them,

654
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:22,363
so i had to have them flown out.
then they got ruined on the plane.

655
00:29:22,363 --> 00:29:25,175
they flew first-class.
well, they're soggy.

656
00:29:25,175 --> 00:29:26,331
you know what, charlie?

657
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:29,969
i have broken my back to try
and make this shower happen.

658
00:29:29,999 --> 00:29:31,894
yeah, well, maybe that's
the way you want it to look.

659
00:29:31,894 --> 00:29:34,300
<i>no, that is the way it is.</i>

660
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,894
this isn't
what i wanted, betty.

661
00:29:35,894 --> 00:29:37,988
well, i'm sorry that this isn't
good enough for you, charlie,

662
00:29:37,988 --> 00:29:39,628
but i have worked
really hard,

663
00:29:39,628 --> 00:29:42,250
and now i feel stupid for even
trying to be nice to you

664
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,750
<i>when you have been
such a jerk.</i>

665
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,863
and i don't know why

666
00:29:44,863 --> 00:29:47,175
i'm letting your crabby
littlettitude get to me,

667
00:29:47,175 --> 00:29:49,112
because henry and i
have already decided that

668
00:29:49,112 --> 00:29:52,050
<i>we're gonna be together even
after he goes back to tucson,</i>

669
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:54,313
whether you like it or not!

670
00:29:55,438 --> 00:29:58,144
what? nothing to say?

671
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:01,425
no. my water just broke.

672
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:07,139
um, are you sure
your water broke?

673
00:30:07,206 --> 00:30:09,439
either that
or i just peed my pants.

674
00:30:09,506 --> 00:30:11,406
okay, i see
how you're playing this.

675
00:30:11,473 --> 00:30:13,128
i remember
last new year's eve,

676
00:30:13,128 --> 00:30:15,506
<i>i was so drunk
that my water broke, too.</i>

677
00:30:15,573 --> 00:30:16,425
ohh!
aah. uhh.

678
00:30:16,425 --> 00:30:20,190
oh, i just had a contraction.
good idea. stick with your story.

679
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:24,487
um, okay. uh, all right.
um, everything's gonna be okay.

680
00:30:24,487 --> 00:30:28,050
just, uh, sit. sit down
and-and try to relax. okay.

681
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,312
breathe.
okay.

682
00:30:40,657 --> 00:30:41,375
hi.

683
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,378
hi. how's your ear?

684
00:30:44,378 --> 00:30:46,613
eh, just a couple
of stitches.

685
00:30:46,613 --> 00:30:49,050
the good news is, it doesn't
stick out as far anymore.

686
00:30:49,988 --> 00:30:51,847
i'm so sorry,

687
00:30:51,847 --> 00:30:55,425
and i-i totally hear you
about gym class,

688
00:30:55,425 --> 00:30:59,175
so maybe justin should go.
maybe i could meet you halfway.

689
00:30:59,175 --> 00:31:03,050
what do you have in mind? he helps
choreograph the cheerleading routines

690
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:05,000
for the rest of the year,
he passes.

691
00:31:05,612 --> 00:31:07,266
think he'd be into that?
are you kidding?

692
00:31:07,316 --> 00:31:09,487
he calls espn
"the cheerleading channel."

693
00:31:09,487 --> 00:31:12,500
he's gonna love it. wow.

694
00:31:13,191 --> 00:31:15,437
thank you, coach diaz.

695
00:31:15,831 --> 00:31:16,705
you're welcome.

696
00:31:20,175 --> 00:31:23,828
hey, um, what's
your first name, anyway?

697
00:31:23,878 --> 00:31:26,175
tony.
i'm hilda.

698
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,453
nice to meet you, hilda.

699
00:31:28,503 --> 00:31:29,690
you, too.

700
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,375
you know, daniel,
when i was a young man,

701
00:31:43,425 --> 00:31:44,738
i was a lot like you.

702
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,375
well, maybe
not as much like you

703
00:31:46,425 --> 00:31:47,987
as i would have liked,

704
00:31:47,987 --> 00:31:51,503
but it wasn't until
i felt good about myself

705
00:31:52,113 --> 00:31:53,988
that i met someone special.

706
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:56,362
so what happened?

707
00:31:56,362 --> 00:31:58,253
mole happened.

708
00:31:58,253 --> 00:31:59,078
is that a girl?

709
00:31:59,128 --> 00:31:59,969
no.

710
00:31:59,999 --> 00:32:03,937
it's a sauce that
everyone makes with chilies

711
00:32:03,987 --> 00:32:07,269
and garlic and peppercorns
and chocolate and broth,

712
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:09,456
and that's how
i would make it.

713
00:32:09,456 --> 00:32:11,250
until one day i thought,

714
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:14,675
i wonder how molasses
would make this taste.

715
00:32:14,675 --> 00:32:15,690
so i add molasses,

716
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:17,738
serve it to my boss,

717
00:32:17,738 --> 00:32:19,237
eyes pop out of his head-

718
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,050
the best thing
he's ever tasted,

719
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:23,999
and i say, "i know."

720
00:32:23,999 --> 00:32:27,300
'cause i knew
that it was special, unique.

721
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,703
so what, you want me
to cook something?

722
00:32:29,753 --> 00:32:30,800
no way.

723
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,613
cooking was my passion.

724
00:32:33,613 --> 00:32:35,250
it changed the way i felt.

725
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:38,925
what makes you
feel good about yourself?

726
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:50,550
you're right.
i don't have any options.

727
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:53,999
so i've decided
to take you up on ur offer.

728
00:32:53,999 --> 00:32:56,050
there is something
that i want from you.

729
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:57,659
and what is that?

730
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:05,500
this is the heartbeat
of the child that i'm carrying.

731
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,125
i want you to watch it,

732
00:33:07,175 --> 00:33:09,425
and for once
in your monstrous life

733
00:33:09,425 --> 00:33:11,250
for you to think
about someone else,

734
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,675
because this baby
is not just some instrument

735
00:33:14,675 --> 00:33:16,687
for whatever wicked game it is
that you're playing.

736
00:33:16,737 --> 00:33:21,144
it's your child, and what
i want from you is a promise

737
00:33:21,144 --> 00:33:22,925
that you will love this baby,

738
00:33:22,925 --> 00:33:26,503
and you will give it
everything that it needs.

739
00:33:34,191 --> 00:33:38,050
ohh, god,
this really hurts!

740
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,500
does it hurt?

741
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,941
i just said
that it does.

742
00:33:40,941 --> 00:33:43,550
you know, a few years ago,
i had some work done on my nose.

743
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,750
it was not a nose job.

744
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,112
<i>everybody thought
it was a nose job,</i>

745
00:33:46,112 --> 00:33:47,425
but it was just
to fix some breathing-

746
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:49,691
had to get it done,
not a nose job-

747
00:33:49,691 --> 00:33:53,891
and it was so painful. it was just like childbirth.

748
00:33:53,941 --> 00:33:56,566
i'm sorry. are you gonna be here the whole time?

749
00:33:56,566 --> 00:33:57,737
whatever you need,

750
00:33:57,737 --> 00:33:59,675
because i know
what you're going through.

751
00:33:59,675 --> 00:34:03,300
okay, well,
i'm kind of thirsty, so...

752
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,894
mm, that reminds me-
i am starving.

753
00:34:05,894 --> 00:34:07,938
okay, guys,
uh, thanks for coming.

754
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:11,773
i just left henry a message.
he must be in the subway. okay.

755
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,425
oh! oh, yes. taxi's here.

756
00:34:14,425 --> 00:34:17,175
come on. let's get you to the hospital.
no, no, no, no, no, not a hospital. no.

757
00:34:17,175 --> 00:34:19,550
i'm going to a birthing center.
i have a midwife.

758
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,113
you know, i want to do this
all natural. no drugs.

759
00:34:21,113 --> 00:34:24,675
<i>i want to feel everything!
oh, god!</i>

760
00:34:24,675 --> 00:34:27,737
okay, uh, well, then let's
get you to the birthing center.

761
00:34:27,737 --> 00:34:31,573
we just need to get you out
the door and in the cab. okay.

762
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,691
look, you're doing it.

763
00:34:32,691 --> 00:34:33,925
you're doing it.
you're doing it.

764
00:34:33,926 --> 00:34:37,188
i'm doing it. ohh, god!
i'll call your midwife.

765
00:34:37,238 --> 00:34:39,050
no, don't do that!
why?

766
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,050
because i don't want her
to hear me say this-

767
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:43,503
i want the drugs.
what?

768
00:34:43,503 --> 00:34:44,737
i want the drugs, betty.
call the hospital.

769
00:34:44,737 --> 00:34:49,113
call the ambulance.
i want the drugs!

770
00:34:49,113 --> 00:34:50,375
okay.
ohh!

771
00:34:50,425 --> 00:34:53,940
um, 9-1-1,
we have a woman in labor.

772
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,363
aah!

773
00:34:55,363 --> 00:34:57,784
she wants the drugs.

774
00:35:02,999 --> 00:35:04,238
oh, my god.

775
00:35:04,238 --> 00:35:07,675
i don't want to be here
when that thing pops out of her.

776
00:35:08,063 --> 00:35:08,629
bye.

777
00:35:11,187 --> 00:35:13,250
betty,
is the ambulance here?

778
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:13,875
any second.

779
00:35:13,925 --> 00:35:16,203
okay. okay, and henry?

780
00:35:16,253 --> 00:35:17,688
he's on his way.

781
00:35:17,738 --> 00:35:18,675
mm. mm.

782
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,050
hold my hand.

783
00:35:21,813 --> 00:35:22,050
what?

784
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,175
hold my hand.

785
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:26,863
why'd you do it, betty?

786
00:35:26,863 --> 00:35:28,988
why did you
throw me a shower?

787
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:32,800
because you're away
from home, stranded-

788
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,737
oh, betty, that is bull!

789
00:35:33,737 --> 00:35:35,862
ow! okay,
maybe that's not why.

790
00:35:35,862 --> 00:35:39,862
maybe i did it because i thought
that if i was friendlier,

791
00:35:39,862 --> 00:35:41,750
you would stop
getting in the way

792
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,313
of henry and i so much.

793
00:35:43,363 --> 00:35:47,113
i'm sorry, betty.
i am so sorry.

794
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,297
t do you know how hard it was
watching the guy that i love

795
00:35:50,347 --> 00:35:52,425
falling in love
with somebody else?

796
00:35:54,313 --> 00:35:56,550
is that why
you cheated on him?

797
00:35:59,188 --> 00:36:00,487
charlie, i'm so sorry.

798
00:36:00,487 --> 00:36:04,250
no, no, no,
it's not your fault. i just...

799
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,040
i never thought it would
be like this, you know?

800
00:36:06,106 --> 00:36:09,550
i never thought i'd be
having a baby... alone.

801
00:36:10,628 --> 00:36:13,562
no. no, no, no,
you're not alone.

802
00:36:14,688 --> 00:36:16,425
hurry. right in here.

803
00:36:16,425 --> 00:36:18,425
oh, thank god. they're here.
the ambulance is here.

804
00:36:18,425 --> 00:36:19,691
okay, okay.

805
00:36:20,813 --> 00:36:23,187
what do you do with these?
where do you begin?

806
00:36:23,237 --> 00:36:27,438
i see exactly what you mean.
the photos just sit there. yes.

807
00:36:27,488 --> 00:36:29,675
they need a point of view.
mm-hmm.

808
00:36:29,675 --> 00:36:31,425
can i weigh in?

809
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,078
you look like hell.

810
00:36:33,128 --> 00:36:34,550
yeah, i know.

811
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:38,687
ooh.
these are not very good.

812
00:36:38,737 --> 00:36:40,112
no. no.

813
00:36:41,828 --> 00:36:44,487
we could saturate the colors,
make 'em pop,

814
00:36:44,487 --> 00:36:47,328
that way we focus on the outfits
instead of the models... mm-hmm.

815
00:36:47,378 --> 00:36:50,237
so it's strictly about the
fashion. yeah, that's great.

816
00:36:50,237 --> 00:36:52,112
i was also thinking,

817
00:36:52,112 --> 00:36:54,093
we always put the photo essays
in the back of the book.

818
00:36:54,143 --> 00:36:55,737
why don't we move 'em
in the front?

819
00:36:55,737 --> 00:36:58,347
you know,
stir things up a little.

820
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,953
well, look at you.
what happened, daniel?

821
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:05,999
i realized something.

822
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:10,438
i mean, i'm always looking
for meaning in my life

823
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,862
everywhere but the place
i can actually find it-

824
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:14,675
right here.

825
00:37:15,206 --> 00:37:18,628
<i>i love this job.</i>

826
00:37:25,312 --> 00:37:27,875
i'm sorry, ma'am,
but you're over 9 centimeters.

827
00:37:27,925 --> 00:37:30,675
i don't think it's a good idea to
move you. here. i'll get some towels.

828
00:37:30,675 --> 00:37:33,062
oh, god,
this really hurts.

829
00:37:33,112 --> 00:37:35,613
i know, but you're
too far along for the drugs.

830
00:37:35,613 --> 00:37:36,940
it's gonna be
the old-fashioned way.

831
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:40,875
oh, the old-fashioned way,
just like you wanted.

832
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,437
oh, shut up, betty!

833
00:37:42,487 --> 00:37:43,891
ow!

834
00:37:45,674 --> 00:37:48,507
oh, oh, i'm sorry.

835
00:37:49,503 --> 00:37:51,703
oh, i'm sorry. you know
i don't really mean that.

836
00:37:51,753 --> 00:37:54,265
i just can't believe i'm having
a baby in your living room.

837
00:37:54,315 --> 00:37:57,453
it's okay. it's okay.
it's okay, charlie.

838
00:37:57,503 --> 00:37:58,425
charlie?

839
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,988
henry? oh, thank you so much, betty.

840
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,050
henry, henry, henry.
d, you have no idea.

841
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,925
betty's kept me
from totally freaking out.

842
00:38:05,925 --> 00:38:08,425
oh, my god. oh, my god.
this is really happening.

843
00:38:08,425 --> 00:38:11,363
okay. it's gonna be okay.
it's gonna be okay.

844
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,425
um, um, here.

845
00:38:16,187 --> 00:38:18,488
no, no, no, no, no. stay, betty.
stay if you want. stay.

846
00:38:18,488 --> 00:38:22,237

of my baby,

855
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:54,828
of your father's baby.

856
00:38:54,878 --> 00:38:59,438

i'm having your father's child.

857
00:38:59,488 --> 00:39:00,953

and i want you to know,

859
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:05,237
my only concern
is protecting this baby

860
00:39:05,237 --> 00:39:08,925
<i>and giving it everything
it deserves.</i>

861
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,175

866
00:39:30,878 --> 00:39:32,988
one hell
of a baby shower.

867
00:39:40,313 --> 00:39:41,628

* yeah, you had your own rules about playing the game *

875
00:40:02,113 --> 00:40:03,988
* and any day you could walk away *

876
00:40:03,988 --> 00:40:04,363
our baby.

* yeah, you're all hung up on somebody else *

880
00:40:14,862 --> 00:40:17,765
* and in your eyes i see all the signs *

881
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:20,253
* of the misery *

882
00:40:20,253 --> 00:40:21,188

* you used to be so proud *

884
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:26,250
* now your head's a little lower *

885
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,641
* and you walk a little slower *

886
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:29,316
* and you *

887
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,999
* don't talk so loud *

888
00:40:33,406 --> 00:40:36,500

889
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:38,688
* yeah, you know how love *

890
00:40:38,738 --> 00:40:41,500
* can build you up one moment *

891
00:40:41,613 --> 00:40:43,816
* and t next,cut you down to size *

* down to size *

893
00:40:45,238 --> 00:40:47,375
* and then you discover *

894
00:40:47,425 --> 00:40:50,875
* all she told you was a bunch of lies *

895
00:40:50,925 --> 00:40:54,703
* didn't you know you'd have to cry sometime? *

896
00:40:54,753 --> 00:40:59,141
* oh *
