00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,450
Breaking Into My Apartment?
I Was Just There For The Book.

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,430
I Didn't Mean To Hear Anybody Having
Sex. Dwayne And I Are Dear Old Friends.

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,690
That Had Nothing To Do With Bradford.

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,050
Keep Your Mouth Shut And
Your Old Man Comes Home.

8
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,850
So Lie To Daniel? Not Lie,
Just Don't Say Anything.

Edyou Wait Till Now To
Tell Me? You're Fired.

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,670
That Woman Doesn't Love
You. Get Out Of My Way.

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,530
From This Day-

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,120

00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,630

24
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,710

He's,Uh... He's Still Unconscious.

27
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,010
It Was A Massive Heart Attack.

00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,500

No,He Saw Me.

36
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,910
He Hates Me.

37
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,120
I Really Am Fired.

You're... Me.

70
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,560
I... I Don't Understand.

71
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,160
Are You My Ghost? Am I Dead?

72
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,810
They Buried In My Poncho?

73
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,750

74
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,540

Yeah,Right. That's Funny.

78
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,770
Hey,I've Been Looking For That.

79
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,970
I Thought Amanda Took It.

80
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,060
I Just Met Her. She Seems Kind Of Mean,

81
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,130
But Maybe Shs Just Having A Bad Day.

82
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,070
No,She's Mean. But I Need That Back.

83
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,010
I'm Packing All My Things Up. Hold On.

84
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,310
You Mean You Actually Got Fired?

85
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,090
How Did That Happen?

86
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,020
I Lied To Daniel, And He Found Out.

87
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,270
You Lied?

88
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,250
I Had To.

89
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,890
Wilhelmina Caught Me
Breaking Into Her Apartment

90
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,980
To Steal The Book. Whoa,Wait.

91
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:10,250
You Broke Into An Apartment And Stole
Something? Look,I Was Just Doing My Job.

92
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,650
Wow. What's Happened To
You? I Mean,You've Changed.

93
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,730
I Barely Even Recognize
You Except For The Braces,

94
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,390
And God,When Are We Getting Those Off?

95
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,080
Look, I Have Not Changed,

96
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:23,390
And Gosh,You Ask A Lot Of Questions.

97
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,350
Well,Only Because I Can't Imagine

98
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,290
How You're Doing The
Things You're Doing.

99
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,110
We're Just Not That Kind Of Girl.

100
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,670
Look,You're A Sweet Kid,Okay?

101
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,110
But You're Young And Naive,

102
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,020
And It's A Lot Trickier Than You Think.

103
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,920
Well,I Don't See What's
So Tricky About It.

104
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,570
I Mean,If It's So Hard To Be
A Good Person In This Place,

105
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:47,020
Well,Then Maybe It's A
Good Thing We're Leaving.

106
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,690
Betty.

107
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,790
Christina,Are You Real?

108
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,970
Are We Done With This Game Then? Yeah.

109
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,310
I Came To Help You Pack Up Your Things.

110
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,200
I Thought This Might
Be A Bit Hard For You.

111
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,430
Christina,Have I Changed...

112
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,810
Since I First Started At "Mode"?

113
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,730
Well,I Think It's Hard Not To Change.

114
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,660
I Don't Know. It's This Place.

115
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,100
It Does Something To You.

116
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,150
Can You Believe This Is Even Happening?

117
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,950
Bradford Seemed Fine.
No,And He's Still Handsome

118
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,200
In,Like,A Sean Connery Kind Of Way.

119
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,070
Why Is It Always Sadder When
Tragedy Strikes Hot People?

120
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,770
No,I Want You To Get
The Hell Out Of Here!

121
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,440
Daniel, Let's Not Make A Scene.
Intensive Care Is For Family Members,

122
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,140
And Since You Never Married My Father,

123
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,270
You're Not Part Of The Family. Stay Out.

124
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,840
I'm Sorry You All Had To See That.

125
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:55,070
I Caught Him Poking
Around The Morphine Drawer.

126
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,990
I Swear,Underneath It
All, He's Still A Good Boy.

127
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,180
Marc,Get The Car. On It.

128
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,450
All Right,People, Get Out Of The Way.

129
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,180
I Got A Very Important Person Here.

130
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,480
Come On,You Wanna Earn
The Badge? Let's Go.

131
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,450
Out Of The Way, Looky-Loos.

132
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,740
My Name Is Marc St. James,

133
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,210
And I'm Playing A Part In This Drama.

134
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,030
Bradford Meade's
To-Die-For Cavalli Suit

135
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,570
May Have Been Just That.

136
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,420
The Publishing Tycoon Was Rushed

137
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,650
To St. Gavan's Hospital
Following His Collapse,

138
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,600
But Mr. Meade Arrived
Sans Said Suit. Where Ist?

139
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,330
Rumors Abound It's Being
Auctioned On The Internet

140
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,390
Where Bids Are As High As $600,000...

141
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,100
I'm Just Wanna Check On The
Football Score. Football?

142
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,620
Bradford Meade Is In The Hospital.

143
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,070
I'm Sure All The Games
Have Been Canceled.

144
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:36,320
Hello. Any News On Mr. Meade?

145
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,720
They Still Haven't Found The
Suit. No,I Mean, How Is Mr. Meade?

146
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,860
Well,He's In A Robin's
Egg Blue Hospital Gown

147
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,200
With White Piping.

148
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,800
They Say He's Still Unconscious.

149
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,700
What Is That? Uh,My
Things From The Office.

150
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,470
Oh,My Baby.

151
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,500
I'm So Sorry.

152
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,840
I Know How Much This Job Meant To You.

153
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,590
It's Okay,Dad. I'm Okay.

154
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,180
Give Me Daniel's Number.

155
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,710
I'll Tell Him The Only
Reason You Lied To Him

156
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,770
About Wilhelmina's Affair Was
To Get Me Home From Mexico.

157
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,290
Dad,No. Look,It's
- It's Probably All For The Best.

158
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,530
Good For You,Honey.

159
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,820
Next,You Join A Gym And Get Smoking Hot.

160
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,050
Then When You Run Into Daniel,

161
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,580
He'll Be Begging You To Come Back.

162
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,410
That's The Way I Always Play It.

163
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,850
Mija, You Okay?

164
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,830
I've Just-

165
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,770
I've Been Thinking About This Last Year,

166
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,540
And... Dad,I've Done Things
That I Never Thought I'd Do.

167
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,320
And I Was The One Person Daniel Trusted.

168
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,970
I Let Him Down.

169
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,140

We Had Separate Rooms And A Fireplace.

175
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:29,460
Um,Okay,Uh,I Don't
Even Know Who You Are,

176
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,360
But You Can't Be Here.

177
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,880
Betty,I'm Leaving The Country Tonight,

178
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,120
But I Need A Favor.

179
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:38,400
Um,No. No,I-I Can't Help
You Get Out Of The Country.

180
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,750
You're A Felon. You Could
Get Us All In Trouble,

181
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,150
And My Father Just Became A Citizen.

182
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:48,350
Here,I Can Give You A Hat. What
About This Sweater? I Like This.

183
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,740
It's Not For Me. It's For My Children.

184
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,450
I Told You, They Gon' Be Fine.

185
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,310
They White.

186
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,560
I Need To Find Out If
Bradford's Changed The Will.

187
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,760
If Wilhelmina Got To Him,

188
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,560
He May Have Left Her The Company.

189
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,930
And I Can't Disappear Without Knowing

190
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,310
My Children Are Taken Care Of.

191
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,940
How Am I Supposed To Know
Anything About Bradford's Will?

192
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,160
I Will Tell You Where
It Is And How To Get It.

193
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,150
It's Right In His Office.

194
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,990
No. I Don't Know. Mrs.
Meade,I Don't Know.

195
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,710
I Mean This Is Exactly The Type Of Thing

196
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,460
I Need To Stop Doing.

197
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,310
Why Would You Stop Helping
People You Care About?

198
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,020
I Thought You And Daniel Were Friends.

199
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,160
You're My Only Hope.

200
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,160
Fine.

201
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,370
Fine,I Will Do It, But For Daniel.

202
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,460
I Owe Him This.

203
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,870
I Just Spoke To Amanda.

204
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,230
No Change. Bradford's Still Unconscious.

205
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,440
It Was A Beautiful Wedding, Willie,

206
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,130
Right Up Until The Heart Attack.

207
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,900
Yes,And Thanks To His
Inconvenient Collapse,

208
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,430
Now My Future Is In Limbo.

209
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,990
Oh,I Know You Don't Like The Limbo

210
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,980
Or The Electric Slide Or
Any Forced Party Dancing.

211
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,050
I Was Supposed To Walk
Into That Building On Monday

212
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,630
As Mrs. Bradford Meade,
Owning Half The Company.

213
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,850
Without That Ring On My Finger,
I Don't Know Where I Stand.

214
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,930
I Know He Changed The Will.

215
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,670
I Just Don't Know What It Says.

216
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,820
For All I Know,

217
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:14,630
He Could Be Leaving
Everything To... Charity.

218
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,180
Marc,I Think You Know
What We Need To Do.

219
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,520
Find This Chity Person And Kill Her.

220
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,980
We Need To Get Our Hands On The Will.

221
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,900
Yeah.

222
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,700
Hey,L'amanda.

223
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,220
I Just Forgot One Thing. I
Need To Scoot Back To My Desk.

224
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,110
Sorry. Aah,Excuse Me?

225
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,630
You Are No Longer
Permitd In These Offices.

226
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,850
Now I Have Received Word You
Are No Longer An Employee.

227
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,330
You Received Word From
Me. I Told You That.

228
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:45,400
If I Hadn't, You Wouldn't
Know. Suarez,I Have A Gun,

229
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,910
And I Will Not Hesitate To Use It.

230
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,350
They Give You A Gun? No,Girl,
They Didn't Give Me No Gun,

231
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,800
But I Swear To You, I Will
Jump Out This Circle Desk

232
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,360
And Tackle You. It'll Just Be A Second.

233
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,950
Okay,Here I Come, 'Cause See,You
- Okay,Okay,Okay.

234
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,200
I'm Going. Get On Outta Here.

235
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,900
That's Right,And Trust Me,
You Don't Want To Mix Up

236
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,060
With The Weekend Security, Suarez.

237
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:08,550
Respect Yourself And Get Outta Here.

238
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,330
I See U,Suarez!

239
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,180
Hey,Are You Okay?

240
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:20,000
Oh,Yeah,My Father's Upstairs
Fighting For His Life.

241
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,530
I'm Taking It Out On
This Vending Machine.

242
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,140
He's Gonna Be Okay,Daniel.

243
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,160
You Told Everyone That Yourself.

244
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,560
Come On,Amanda.

245
00:05:45,355 --> 00:11:30,710
What Was I Supposed To Say,Hmm?

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:11:30,745
Dr. Dredski To Pathology.

247
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,910
It's Just...

248
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:42,090
You Always Think You're Gonna
Have More Time With Someone.

249
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,590
I Never Told Him I Loved Him.

250
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,410
Do You Love Him?

251
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,950
Yes.

252
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,030
Yes.

253
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,120
We Were Just Never
One Of Those Families.

254
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,570
We Never Said It.

255
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,660
Look,Daniel,

256
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,380
You May Never Have Gotten
His Love Or Approval,

257
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,950
But At Least You Got His Jawline.

258
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,460
Daniel,He's Not Gone.

259
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,480
He's Right Upstairs,

260
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:25,040
And You Can Still Go Tell
Him Anything You Want To.

261
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,920
Hey,L'amanda.

262
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,840
Hey,Cutie-Pie.

263
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,090
You Just Missed Your
Girlfriend,Betty Suarez.

264
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,620
Ugh. Girlfriend. Please.

265
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,010
I Don't Know How Many Times
I Have To Tell That Girl,

266
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,280
That Is Not The Way I Roll.

267
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,200
Oh,Really? Oh,No.

268
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,320
I'm Sweet Like Sugar, Soft Like Suede,

269
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,260
But Unlike A Piano, I Never Get Played.

270
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,480
Ooh,Honey,Listen,

271
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,400
I Will Play You Like Stevie Wonder

272
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,380
On A Baby Grand.

273
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,480
Sugarstick, Where You Been All My Life?

274
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,210
Math Camp.

275
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,040
Mm,Well,1 Plus 1...

276
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,680
Is 2.

277
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,630
I Knew That.

278
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,220
I Knew You Knew That.

279
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,330
I'm Glad You Knew That
I Knew That You Knew

280
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,150
That I Knew That.

281
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,590
Betty?

282
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,340
Who The Hell Are You?

283
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,930
Uh,Cable Company.

284
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,410
I Didn't Let Anyone In
From A Cable Company.

285
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,310
The Cable Company.

286
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,430
Seriously? Mrs. Meade?

287
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,460
How Many Homes Did You Break Into

288
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,250
Before You Got Caught?
The Cable Company.

289
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,210
You Tell Me That I'm Stupid... Why You Got To
Be Bustin' Me Out Like That In Front Of People?

290
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,450
Fish,Don't Do This, And Fish Don't Do
That. I Told You This Was Not A Good-

291
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,290
You Know Exactly What You're Doing...
Everybody Believes Somebody Came...

292
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,320
And You've Known It From The Very Beginning.
From The Cable Company. I Told You.

293
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:12,990
Mr. Suarez, So Nice
To See You Again. Hi.

294
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,850
I'm Just Saying,

295
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,160
You Looked A Little Too Into
The Whole Sugarstick Thing.

296
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,420
Hey,I Let You Slip Past L'amanda

297
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,390
So You Can Get The Key
To The Executive Floor.

298
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,750
It's Kind Of Nice Having The Sweetness
Recognized. I Call You Sweet All The Time.

299
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,160
I Know. I'm Just Playin'
Ya. Don't Do That.

300
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,240
Sorry. Okay,I'm Gonna Go
In And Look For The Safe.

301
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,220
You Be Lookout. Oh,No,I
Wanna Look For The Safe.

302
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,060
No,You're Lookout. Okay,You're
Acting Sort Of Bossy.

303
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,840
Oh. Oh,God,I-I Am.

304
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,270
I Used To Just Be A Liar And A Thief,

305
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,670
And Now I'm Bossy,Too.

306
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,520
Sweetie,If It Makes You Feel Any Better,

307
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:48,550
You've Always Been A Little
Bossy. Oh,Thank You, Sugarstick.

308
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,450
If I Ate Lunch,

309
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,490
Now Would Be The Time To Lose It.

310
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,850
What Are You Two Doing Here?

311
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,350
I Imagine E Same Thing
You're Doing Here.

312
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,250
You're Looking For A Memento

313
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,390
To Remember Your Dying Husband?

314
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,210
Oh,Um, Technically Fianc?

315
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,950
That's One.

316
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,620
Yes,Uh,We Are Here
Looking For A Memento,Too.

317
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,970
Yeah,Mr. Meade Meant A Lot To Me,

318
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:29,230
Being My Girlfriend's Boss' Father.

319
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,780
Well,Don't Let Us Stop You.

320
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,630
Or Us You.

321
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,750
Nope.

322
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,860
No Memento There.

323
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,350
Nothing In Here,Either.

324
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,170
Ooh,Ooh.

325
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:07,490
What Is It? Everyone's
Salaries. Nice,Willie.

326
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,860
Oh,Let's End This.

327
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,420
I Can't Stand Another
Minute In This Room

328
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,240
With Tweedledee And Tweedle Diego.

329
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,480
Obviously,You Want To
Find The Will For Daniel.

330
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,110
I Don't Know What You're Talking About.

331
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,130
Oh,Betty. We Both Want The Same Thing.

332
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,710
Why Don't We Agree To Find The Will,

333
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,660
Read It,Shake Hands,

334
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,940
Wash Our Hands And Go On With Our Lives?

335
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,930
Please, Do You Really Think

336
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,170
I Enjoy Scheming,Lying,
And Scurrying About

337
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:36,150
Like Some Rat With Great
Cheekbones? Yes,I Think You Do.

338
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,090
Mm,Maybe A Little.

339
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,770
But Seriously, I Am Tired Of The Drama.

340
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,710
So Much Drama.

341
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,430
The Will Is In The Wall Safe.

342
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,370
I Have The Combination.

343
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,820
I low Ouyou'ren Trble,Mrs. Meade,

344
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,870
But I Don't Like It.

345
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,990
My Betty's Doing Things She Shouldn't Be
Doing. I Did Not Force Her To Do Anything.

346
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,700
She Said She Wanted Do It For Daniel.

347
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,140
Daniel? After The Way He Treated Her?

348
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,820
Why? What-What Happened?
I'll Tell You What Happened.

349
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,080
Papi.

350
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,370
It's My Other Daughter. Hide.

351
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,120
She Won't Like This.

352
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,580
Are You There?

353
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,430
What Are You Doing Lying On Betty's Bed?

354
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,940
Oh,Nothing.

355
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,880
Putting Away Some Clothes And Got Tired.

356
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,080
Who's She?

357
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,100
Exterminator.

358
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,610
Unbelievable.

359
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,340
Mrs. Meade?

360
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,390
You Are The Worst Fugitive In The World.

361
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,050
Okay,Just So We're
Clear, We Read The Will,

362
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,890
And No Matter Who Wins, We
Respect Mr. Meade's Wishes.

363
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,380
Agreed.

364
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,370
I Just Want To Be Done Here

365
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,710
And Go Back To Mourning My Late Husband.

366
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,750
Um,He's Not Dead Yet,

367
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:13,130
And,Once Again, You're
Not Technically Married.

368
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,670
That's Two.

369
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,660
Just Know,People Don't Make It To Three.

370
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,720
Okay,Uh,Here We Go.

371
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,810
Oh,Al Capone's Vault. It's Empty.

372
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,940
Oh,Balls.

373
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,510
The Boat Takes Us To
Naples, We Clear Customs,

374
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:35,170
We Start A New Life In
Italy. If You Make It.

375
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,690
We Gon' Make It.

376
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,200
You Have Passports?

377
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,110
Ooh,Darn, We Forgot The Passport-

378
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,570
Yeah,We Got Some Passports. Show 'Em.

379
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,230
I Have The Travel Documents.
She Has The Puzzles.

380
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,720
Are You Out Of Your Mind? What?

381
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,310
Well,She Kinda Looks Like The Picture

382
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,980
On Her Fake Passport,

383
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:01,070
But,Um,You Don't,

384
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,690
And You're Claire Meade.

385
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,220
Your Face Is Everywhere.

386
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,780
If You Wanna Be "Maria Elena Sonzoni"...

387
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,760
You Gotta Look Like Maria Elena Sonzoni.

388
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:13,010
I'm Sorry,But I Just Haven't
Had Time For A Makeover.

389
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,660
Oh. Well...

390
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,870
Lady Fugitive,You Have
Come To The Right Place.

391
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,470
The Will's Supposed To Be In The Safe.

392
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:24,910
I Don't Understand.

393
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,480
Damn Bradford.

394
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,930
Always So Paranoid.
Everything Was Such A Secret.

395
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,540
Secret. Secret?

396
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:32,810
Secret Room! Secret Room!

397
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,160
What Room?

398
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,810
What Are You Talking
About? What's Going On?

399
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,880
Oh,Betty,There's Something
On Your Glasses. Really?

400
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,270
Oops. Sorry.

401
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,720
Oh,My God, That Actually Worked.

402
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,490
Come On,Curly. Right Behind You,Moe.

403
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,550
Marc! Marc! Marc,No!

404
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:55,630
No,No! Marcmarc!

405
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,390
So What Do You Think?

406
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,100
Sweet.

407
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,450
You Know,You Could Do A Lot Of Business

408
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,610
In The Escapee Community.

409
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,780
You Look Like Chita Rivera.

410
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,680
What?

411
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,400
No,No,No, That's A Compliment.

412
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,340
He's Really Got A Thing For Chitrivera.

413
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,620
It's Okay,Dad.

414
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:26,010
You Don't Have To Fight Anymore.

415
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,910
Just Know That I Love You.

416
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,880
If You're Ready, You Can Go.

417
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,790
What Are You Doing?

418
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,240
I'm Helping Him.

419
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,610
Go. Go Towards The Light.

420
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,680
No,Dad. Don't Go To The Light.

421
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,270
Light Bad. No Light,No
- Will You Stop?

422
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,460
The Doctors Practically Told Us

423
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,020
He's Not Going To
Come Out Of This. Dad-

424
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,990
He Is T Gonna Die. Stay Away
From That Damn Light,Dad.

425
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,610
Daniel,I Am Trying To Help Him Find The
Light. Listen To Me. What Are You Doing?

426
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,150
You're Not Helping Him.
Yes,I Am Helping Him.

427
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,530
You're Sending Him To The Light. He's Not
- Will You Two Stop Fighting?

428
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,780
Dad? You're Awake.

429
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,510
Dad,Can You Hear Us?

430
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,630
Dad. See? Ow.

431
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:05,840
Mr. Meade And Fey Sommers
Had A Secret Sex Room?

432
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:08,650
Yeah. I Know About It.
Marc Knows About It.

433
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,450
That's Where The Will Has To Be.

434
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:15,210
Does Anybody Else Know About It?
Um,Yeah,Christina. Oh,And I Think Amanda.

435
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,130
Oh,So Apparently Everyone Knew

436
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,780
About The Big,Fancy
Sex Room, Except For Me.

437
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,360
It's Like Freshman Year Alover Again.

438
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,660
What Is Going On? I Keep Calling

439
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,350
Your Girlfriend L'amanda
To Get Us Out Of Here,

440
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,300
And She's Not Answering.

441
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,160
Oh,Yes.

442
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,910
What?

443
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,550
What Are You Looking At?

444
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,020
That Grate.

445
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
It Gets Us Into The Vents
And The Vents Go Everywhere.

446
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,500
This Could Be Our Way Out.

447
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:46,940
Hold On,Agent Bauer.

448
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,340
We Are Not Wriggling
Through A Heating System.

449
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,140
Do You Want To Get That Will
Or Not? Now Come Over Here.

450
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:56,050
I'll Climb Up First, And Then I'll Pull
You Up. Wow. Now Who's The Bossy One?

451
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:59,370
You Know You Love It. True.

452
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:04,710
Wow. I Can't Believe This Even Exists,

453
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:07,760
That Bradford Was Even Into This.

454
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,080
He Never Invited Me Down Here.

455
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:13,640
I Can Do That.

456
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:20,950
Ooh,I Like This.

457
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,730
Ooh,I Got It. I Got It. I Got It.

458
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:22,810
I Got It. I Got It. I Got It.

459
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,120
What Does It Say? Well,Give Me A Minute.

460
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,860
I Haven't Read That Many Wills Before.

461
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,560
Oh! Okay,Uh,Uh,

462
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,110
"And Wilhelmina Slater
Will Share My Estate"...

463
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,190
Blah,Blah,Blah,Blah, Blah,Blah,Blah...

464
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,250
"Including, But Not Limited

465
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,540
To The Holdings Of Meade Publications"...
I'm Getting A Good Feeling.

466
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,470
"Upon The Pronouncement
Of Our Marriage. "

467
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,800
And There Goes That Feeling.
It's Over. We're Sunk.

468
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,740
Upon Pronouncement Of Our Marriage.

469
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,060
Oh, I'm Gonna Have To Go Back

470
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:50,350
To Dancing In A Cage In My Underwear.

471
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,720
Hold On.

472
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,670
Perhaps There's Another Option.

473
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,140
Oh,Thank God, Because
To Be Honest With You,

474
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,360
I Only Had This One Move. Ow.

475
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,570
There Still Might Be Another Way

476
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:04,140
To Legally Become Mrs. Bradford Meade.

477
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,770
Is There Water Boiling Underneath You?

478
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,330
'Cause I Think I Smell A Plan Brewing.

479
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,950
We're In A Vent.

480
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,300
Can You Believe This?

481
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,270
We Are Actually Crawling Through A Vent.

482
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,630
My Mother Never Even Let
Me Put My Feet On The Sofa.

483
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,880
I Can't Believe You're Enjoying This.

484
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:25,170
I'm Hot,And I'm Sweaty, And I Give Up.

485
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,490
Betty,Come On. Tap In To
Your Inner Action Hero.

486
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,900
Okay,Mexicans Don't Have Action Herry.

487
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,530
H Weave A Speedy Little Mouse.

488
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,560
Oh,Wait,Wait. We're Coming Up To It.

489
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:40,540
Oh,Thank God. If I Didn't Think
We Were Running Out Of Oxygen,

490
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,330
I'd Kiss You. Now You
Said That The Secret Room

491
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,050
Is Right Behind The
Closet,Right? Uh-Huh.

492
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,700
We Went 30 Yards At A 40-Degree Angle

493
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,110
From The Elevator.

494
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,610
Well,If My Calcations Are Correc..

495
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,040
Found It.

496
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,060
Oh,Hallelujah.

497
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,790
Ooh,L'amanda. Yes?

498
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,500
I Couldn't Stay Away.

499
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:13,010
When There's Chemistry,
There's Chemistry.

500
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,510
L'amanda-

501
00:24:14,545 --> 00:24:14,545
Oh!

502
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,040
You And I Are Like Water And Magnesium.

503
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,120
E
- Explosive.

504
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:24,230
I Am Gonna Learn So Much From You.

505
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,880
No! No.

506
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,850
L'amanda,I Can't Do This. I'm A Dog.

507
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,360
I Will Break Your Heart. Let's
Never Speak Of This Again.

508
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,650
No,But-

509
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:55,470
Shh.

510
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,320
Shh. Shh.

511
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:03,160
But I Like Dogs.

512
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,070
Shh. Shh. Shh.

513
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,310
Daniel?

514
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,120
Yeah,It's Me,Dad.

515
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,300
I'm Glad You're Here.

516
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,140
Yeah,Me,Too.

517
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,960
Alexis Just Went Out
To Get You Some Water.

518
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,960
Look,Uh,There's Something...

519
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,690
I
- I've Been Wanting To Say To You.

520
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:40,770
And It's,Uh, Just,It's Hard For Me.

521
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,700
I Mean,We Talk...

522
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,420
But We Don't Really Talk.

523
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:48,370
I Don't Know Why.

524
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,020
You're Gonna Be Okay.

525
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,080
Listen...

526
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:10,020
I'm Just Gonna Tell
The Doctor You're Awak

527
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,790
I Love You,Too,Son.

528
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,890
Mrs. Meade,It's Me.

529
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,300
I Found The Will.

530
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,530
And?

531
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,600
Daniel And Alexis Are Okay.

532
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:40,500
Oh,Thank You. Oh,I'll Never Forget This.

533
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:41,920
Can We Please Get Out Of Here?

534
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,500
Because I Am Really
Starting To Lead L'amanda On.

535
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,120
I Just Need To Do One More Thing.

536
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,690
I Need To Leave A Strongly Worded Note

537
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,720
To That Jerk Marc. Okay.

538
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,310
"Dear Marc"
- No. "Marc. "

539
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,000
Good.

540
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:54,970
Yeah.

541
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,310
Please Thank Betty Again For Me.

542
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,190
Now I Can Leave In Peace.

543
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,430
Yeah 'Cause Crossing The Atlantic

544
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:04,630
Was Gon' Be A Bitch If She
Was In One Of Her Moods.

545
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,570
You Have The Travel
Scrabble? Yeah,I Got It.

546
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,040
Hey,Can I Eat Dinner In Front Of The Tv?

547
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,760
They're Doing An Interview
On Christina Aguilera

548
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:15,580
About The Meade Wedding.
I Am Such An Ag-Hag.

549
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,080
You Look Familiar.

550
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,620
Oh,Um...

551
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,570
She's Just An Old Friend Of The Family.

552
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:24,580
Can't Quite Place The Face.
A Little Chita Rivera,Right?

553
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:26,070
So Can I Eat And Watch?

554
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,050
Sure,Honey.

555
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,080
Thanks. Love You,Mom.

556
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,710
I Love You,Too.

557
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:37,820
You,Uh... Have A Very Sweet Boy.

558
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,040
Thank You.

559
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,430
I Can't Do It,

560
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,300
Not Without Seeing My Children.

561
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,950
I Have To Get To The Hospital.
Would You Please Take Me?

562
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:51,180
Fish,No. Now You Walk
Up In There,You Caught.

563
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,880
I'll Be Okay. Now Wait Here.

564
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:56,670
We Are Going To Italy.

565
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,630
But If I'm Not Back By 8:00,

566
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:03,210
Promise You'll Go Without Me.

567
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,560
"So In Conclusion,

568
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,990
You Are A Weenie. "

569
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,730
You're Taking A Writing Class?

570
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,360
I Repeated My Thesis. He Is A Weenie.

571
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:30,320
And Now I'm Gonna Put It
Where He Can't Miss It.

572
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,550
You Know,Wilhelmina
Also Locked Us In There.

573
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,240
Yeah, But She Scares Me. Ah.

574
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,250
What Is This?

575
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,330
It Looks Like Marc's Been Ordained

576
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,340
To Perform Weddings.

577
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,880
For Who?

578
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,400
Oh,God.

579
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,970
????

580
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,550
We May Be Able To Perform
Surgery In The Morning.

581
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,920
Thank You,Doctor. Oh,This Is Good.

582
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,840
I Told You Not To Count Out
Bradford Meade. He's A Redwood.

583
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:05,480
I Guess You're Right. He's
Stronger Than I Thought.

584
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,470
Remember When He Spent Eight Hours

585
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,100
Trying To Catch That
Marlin Off Of Portugal?

586
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,420
God,That Was A Great Vacation.

587
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:13,720
Yeah, I Wish He'd Taken Us.

588
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:16,520
Excuse Me,Daniel,I-

589
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:19,120
Mr. Suarez, What Are You Doing
Here? Come With Me,Please.

590
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,820
It's About Your Mother.

591
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,400
They're Gone. Perfect.

592
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,220
I Now Pronounce You Man And Wife!

593
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,690
Oh,Will You Stop That?
You're Ordained,Not Magical.

594
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,450
Do You Have The Papers?
It's All Right Here.

595
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,240
Okay,Well,We Need A
Witness,So Find Someone.

596
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:35,930
Oh.

597
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,230
Oh,Bradford.

598
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,670
Bradford,My Love, I'm Here.

599
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,990
My Darling.

600
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,700
You're Awake. I'm So Happy.

601
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:59,740
And I Have Some Wonderful News.

602
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:03,220
You And I Can Still Be Married.

603
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,800
I'm Leaving Tonight.

604
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,370
Mom,You Can't.

605
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,170
Please Stay. We Just Got You Back.

606
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,370
We Can Find Someplace For You To Hide.

607
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:20,090
I Can't Live Like That, Sweetheart.

608
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,770
They'll Give Up Looking
For Me Eventually,

609
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,480
And We'll Meet Up Somewhere.

610
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,110
Now Just Remember,

611
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:29,130
You Two Need Each Other.

612
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,810
You're All You Have.

613
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:33,020
Mom,How Is It That You're
Here? How Did This Happen?

614
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,930
Betty And Her Family.

615
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,090
And,Daniel, You Need To Know

616
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,570
Why Betty Didn't Tell You
About Wilhelmina's Affair.

617
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:51,290
"Do You,Bradford Meade,
Take Wilhelmina Slater"-

618
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,900
Wait,Wait.

619
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,500
Bradford What Is It? You All Right?

620
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:59,460
Danielold Me That You
Slept With Your Bodyguard.

621
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,870
That's Ridiculous.

622
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,980
You're Not Making Any Sense.

623
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,550
Now,Sweetheart, I Just Need You

624
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,490
To Say Two Words, "I Do",

625
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,750
And Then We'll Get You Some Pudding.

626
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,890
I Need You To Look Me In The Eye

627
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,350
And Tell Me You Didn't Do It.

628
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:18,630
I Never Slept With Him.

629
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:24,920
You Never Loved Me, Did You?

630
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:25,700
Now,Bradford-

631
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,900
Go On. Get Out Of Here.
I Wa To See My Family.

632
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,560
Go On.

633
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,340
Hey!

634
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,660
Excuse Me.

635
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,100
Mr. Meade, What Happened?

636
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,770
Tell Me You Didn't Marry Her.

637
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:48,710
Oh,No, I Came To My Senses.

638
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,070
I Was A Silly Old Fool.

639
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,330
Wilhelmina Never Loved Me.

640
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,370
Only Pson Who Ever Loved
Me Is My Wife Claire.

641
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,270
Why Am I Telling You This?

642
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:06,560
Would You Like To Tell Her?

643
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,590
Mrs. Meade,It'setty.

644
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,140
Um,I'm Here With Your Husband.

645
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,460
He Wants To Talk To You.

646
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,810
You're In The Elevator?

647
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:23,680
Mom, You Can't Be
Serious. I Am Doing This.

648
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,490
I Would Rather Spend The
Rest Of My Life In Jail

649
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,830
Than Give Up The Chance To
See My Husband One Last Time.

650
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:29,960
We'll Walk You In.

651
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:33,870
No,I Want To Do This Alone,

652
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,590
And I Don't Want Him
To See Me Like This.

653
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,650
Isn't That Claire Meade?

654
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,110
Claire, Come Get A Picture!

655
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,230
Right Here,Claire.

656
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,440
Claire.

657
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,820
You Can't Be Here.

658
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,520
I Don't Care.

659
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,590
I'm So Sorry.

660
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,360
I
Didn't-I-

661
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,680
Shh.

662
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,770
Shh. Don't Talk.

663
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:25,450
Let's Just Sit Here.

664
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,310
You Know, On Our Wedding Day,

665
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,090
When I Was Waiting To
Walk Down The Aisle To You,

666
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,690
I Remember Thinking,

667
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,910
Someday That Son Of A Bitch
Is Going To Break My Heart.

668
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,470
And I Did.

669
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:46,090
But I'd Take That Walk Again Tomorrow

670
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,240
If You Could Promise
Me Another 35 Years.

671
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:59,320
I've Never Loved Anyone More Than You.

672
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:06,170
Thank You For Giving
Me The Greatest Life.

673
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,970
I'll Give You Guys A Minute.

674
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:25,800
Look,I Know Why You Couldn't Tell Me

675
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:28,480
About Wilhelmina's Affair.

676
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,670
Daniel, All I Care About

677
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,930
Is That You Know I'm On Your Side...

678
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,090
Always.

679
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,290
I Know.

680
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,440
I
- I Just...

681
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:40,230
Felt Betrayed.

682
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:44,240
Betty,I Would Love For
You To Come Back To Work.

683
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:48,290
That Means So Much.

684
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,090
But I Don't Think I Can.

685
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,780
What?

686
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:00,480
Daniel,This
- This Last Year At "Mode,"

687
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,920
I
- I Wouldn't Trade That For Anything.

688
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:04,610
I Mean,You Took A Chance On Me,

689
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,220
And It Opened Up A
Whole Different World.

690
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:08,960
It Totally Changed My Life,

691
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:12,980
But,I Think,Too Much.

692
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,350
I'm Changing Into Someone That I
- I Really Don't Want To Be.

693
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,610
So You're Leaving?

694
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,710
I Think I Have To.

695
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:28,740
It's Your Life,Betty.

696
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:31,970
You Do What You Have To Do.

697
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:56,660
Oh! Please Let Me Go See Him One More-

698
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,200
She's Not Resisting.
Don't Hurt Her. Come On.

699
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,890
