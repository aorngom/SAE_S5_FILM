Why would fey have
pictures of me in her safe?

14
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,000
Fey sommers
was your mother.

15
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,600
I know who killed fey sommers.
(Whispers) it was me.

16
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,400
And i may be gone
for very long time.

17
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,600
You ju really seemed to up
your game when betty showed up.
What?

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,800
I don't think i'm

What happened?

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,600
We're trying to figure
that out, ma'am.

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,200
You passed out
in gio's deli.

24
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,300
Come on.
Gio.

25
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,100
Apparently you threw
a trash can through the window.

26
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,300
What? I wouldn't do that.

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,400
Oh.

I won't be pressing
any charges.
No, no, no, no, gio.

32
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,800
If--If i did
something illegal,

33
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,600
Then i'm prepared
to face the consequences.

34
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,300
What would i be
looking at, officer?

35
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,600
Breaking and entering,
criminal trespassing,

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,700
Vandalism--
Say five years.

37
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,100
(Whispers) help.

38
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,700
Yeah, okay.
We're good here.

39
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,300
(Normal voice) gio, i would
never throw a trash can.

40
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,600
Once, uh, i-In school,
tommy deluca--

41
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,800
He threw a-A butter pat
on the ceiling,

42
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,600
And i was the one
who told the teacher.

43
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,000
Actually, ofcer,
if--If you knew me,

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,700
This would be
really funny. (Laughs)

45
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,900
Crime isn't funny.

46
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,300
Oh, no, i-I di--I didn't
mean that crime was funny.

47
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,400
I just--I just meant
that this situation,

48
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,800
With me and--
And--And handcuffs...

49
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,900
Okay, okay.

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,200
I don't understand.

51
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,700
I'm so not mysel lately.

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,800

the prosecution, that is,</i>

54
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,900
<i>In the claire meade
murder trial.</i>

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,500
<i>She's pleaded not guilty
by reason of insanity,</i>

56

of fey sommers,</i>

All righty.

64
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,400
We got some more suits in
for your testimony.

65
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,600
Valentino sent this,

66
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,900
Dolce & gabbana sent this,

67
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,100
And ozwald boateng
sent this.

68
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,800
I-I think that one's
too boxy.

69
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,900
Oh. Hey, what about this?

70
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,100
That'll make
my eyes pop, huh?

71
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,000
Daniel, forget about boxy.

72
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,400
This is
your mother's murder trial,

73
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,000
Not tobey maguire's
birthday party

74
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,300
At bungalow 8.

75
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,800
You need to appear
conservative and trustworthy.

76
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,600
Betty's right.

77
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,200
We're the face
of our mother's defense.

78
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,800
The jury needs to see us
as just plain folk.

79
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,600
Said the amazon transsexual.

80
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,200
Betty, my mother needs
some things from her place.

81
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
Can you please
pick 'em up

82
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,900
And bring 'em
to the courthouse?
Of course.

83
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,100
Her mon atelier suit,
matching pumps--

84
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,500
Oh, and this perfume
she loves.

85
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,400
It's on
her dressing table.

86
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,200
All right. No problem.
I'll go right now.

87
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,300
I can't believe
we're doing this today.

88
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
Guys, don't worry.

89
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,100
You're gonna be great.

90
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
You're really gonna
help your mom's case.

91
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,800
What if we don't?

92
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,600
You want a what?

93
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,500
A baby. You know,
tiny and soft

94
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,200
With a face
like a little old man?

95
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,700
And you want me
to carry it in my womb?

96
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,100
Well, we would ask
for your purse,

97
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,900
But we don't want a baby
that grew in a gucci knockoff.

98
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,300
(Scottish accent)
shortbread, love?

99
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,600
Oh, my god.
He's--He's not--Not the...

100
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
(Laughs)
(laughs) no, no.

101
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,400
(Normal voice) though
we would make a good one--

102
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,100
Her evil disposition,
my eyes...

103
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,400
That kid
would be unstoppable.

104
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,200
No.
It's an anonymous donor.

105
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,700
Marc has been
such a good friend

106
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,300
Since i made the decision
to have another child.
Mm.

107
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,100
And since i decided
to leave "mode"--
You were fired.

108
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,400
You're right.
I was fired.

109
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,700
So why do you need me?
Why don't you just do it?

110
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,700
Well, according to my doctor,
my eggs are fine,

111
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,400
But, um...

112
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,500
I can't carry the baby.

113
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,500
It's tragic.

114
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,200
Bono and sheryl crow
should do a benefit concert

115
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,200
For her lady parts.

116
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,100
Well, sorry.

117
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,800
Look, think of it
as giving up your body

118
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,600
For nine months--
Strictly a financial agreement,

119
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,700
And i'd offer you $100,000.

120
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,200
Wow. What would i do
with $100,000?

121
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,800
I don't know, maybe purchase
an experimental surgery

122
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,700
For someone...
(scottish accent) i love.

123
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,800
Oh. You know
all about stuart.

124
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,900
Evil is all-Knowing.

125
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,000
Well,
thank you very much,

126
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,600
Both of you,
for your kind ofr,

127
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,900
But my uterus
is officially closed

128
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,800
To devil spawn.

129
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,100
Wilhelmina's having a baby,

130
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,200
And she wants you
to carry it for her?

131
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,000
Yeah, and she was gonna pay me
100 grand to do it.

132
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,200
Which would pay
for stuart's operation.

133
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,800
Thankfully, though i don't
need to carry the demon seed,

134
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,600
'Cause i've got another way
to get the money.
Oh, you do?

135
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,500
A couple of weeks ago,

136
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,700
I was
archiving some gowns,

137
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,500
And i came across this.

138
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,700
Now jackie kennedy
wore it

139
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,800
To a state dinner
at the white house.

140
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,300
Oh, my god.
This must be worth, like--

141
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,300
$100,000
on the black market.

142
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,800
Oh, now, betty,
i know what you're thinking.

143
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,500
It's just a piece of cloth.
Christina, that's stealing.

144
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,300
But it could save
stuart's life.

145
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,200
Well, when you
put it that way...

146
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,300
Oh.

147
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,400
<i>(Man) * now everybody you see *</i>

148
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,800
<i>* now everybody
is in the groove *</i>

149
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,200
Excuse me,
who the hell are you?

150
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,900
Oh, the cafeteria
was packed.

151
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,100
You're gettingalad dressing
on my mother's ottoman.

152
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,900
How do you even know
about this place?

153
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,500
Everody knows. You think
you can keep this a secret?

154
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,400
Man, i need to catch
a 5-Minute nap.
Who the hell are you?

155
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,800
I'm tired.

156
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,200
Wait.

157
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,100
Wait, those sheets
are chinese silk. Eww.

158
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,000
People...

159
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,500
This was my late mother
fey sommers' secret sex room.

160
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,100
It was designed
for lazy afternoons

161
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,000
That blurred the line
between pleasure and pain.

162
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,800
It is not a place
for salads or naps.

163
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,100
That's it. I'm getting
her stuff out of here.

164
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,600
All of thi
belonged to my mother,

165
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,300
Who, i like to think,
had multiple orgasms

166
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,000
Right where you're sitting.

167
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:46,900
That's right.

168
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,400
She was that kind of lady.

169
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,100
Good-Bye.

170
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,300
Oh, my god.

171
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,000
Diary pages?

And you brought
my perfume.

179
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,200
Oh, when i would wear this,

180
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,400
I would feel so special.

181
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,300
Mm.

182
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,800
You know, your father brought
this back for me from denmark.

183
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,100
He would love
when i wore this.

184
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,800
(Voice breaks)
i miss him so much.

185
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,500
Mom, you have
to pull it together.

186
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,500
What's the use?
I'm going away forever.
Mom, no.

187
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,500
You were not in your right mind
at the time of the accident.

188
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,300
Your lawyer's going
to prove it.

189
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,800
I'm sorry.
I can't allow the peume.
Come on, please.

190
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,100
Daniel, it's all right.
This is my life now.

191
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,700
I used to plan
garden parties.

192
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,300
Now i get a flashlight
in my tush every morning.

193
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,900
I'll live.

194
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
Betty?

195
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,200
I want you to take this.

196
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,700
Okay. Yeah,
i'll hold on to it.

197
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,400
No, i want you
to have it.

198
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,300
Come here.
Now you're in love

199
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,100
With that nervous little fellow
with the glasses.

200
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,500
I want you to wear it
and spoil yourself.

201
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,800
Uh, no, m-Mrs. Meade,

202
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,800
It's--It's too fancy,
and it's yours,

203
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,200
And--And daniel
and alexis are right,

204
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,800
<i>You are gonna get
out of here,</i>

205
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,100
And then you're gonna
need it again,

206
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,700
So--So i'lljust--I'll just
keep it safe for you.

207
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,700
Thank you.

208
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,600
My mother raised us

209
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,700
With a strong sense
of right and wrong.

210
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,000
She was clearly

211
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,400
Not in her right mind
at the time of fey's accident.

212
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,300
Hmm. Ms. Meade,

213
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,900
You seem like you were
very close to your mother.

214
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,100
Can you describe
her state of mind

215
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,800
In the days leading up
to the accident?

216
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,800
Um, i didn't hear anything.
Do you hear anything?

217
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,900
I didn't hear anything.
I'm sorry. Louder?

218
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,800
I-I wasn't in contact
with my mother at that time.

219
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,600
Right, right,

220
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,300
<i>Because you had
lied to your family</i>

221
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,800
About a skiing accident
in order to cover up

222
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,100
Your secret
sex change operation.

223
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,700
Is this an example
of the strong sense

224
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,600
Of right and wrong
your mother taught you?
Objection.

225
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,200
Ms. Meade made a very difficult
personal decision

226
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,700
To become a woman--
A very attractive woman--

227
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,500
But that is
no reflection on--

228
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,800
Her mother's ability to
commit premeditated murder?

229
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,000
That's enough, counsel.

230
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,500
Ms. Meade's personal choices
are not on trial.

231
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,400
<i>I just know my mother
would never kill anyone, ever!</i>

232
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,400
Obviously there was
something wrong with her.

233
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,100

I mean, not that you
don't always smell good.

It's mrs. Meade's.

Whoa. Whoa, okay.
Thank you.

305
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,700
So why two?

306
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,600
Because one is for me,

307
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,900
And one is for
henry's care package.

308
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,000
He's going out
of town.

309
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,200
Egg salad.

310
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,600
I should've guessed.
It travels well.

311
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,800
So where is eggy
heading to, anyway?

312
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,600
Tucson.
His baby's sonogram.

313
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,800
Mmm. Mmm.

314
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,100
(Mouth full)
this is really good.

315
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,100
The flavors in pastrami
taste like...

316
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,200
Like...

317
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,200
Like purple.

318
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,300
Right.

319
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,600
Well, don't worry.

320
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,400
Whatever happens in tucson
stays in tucson.

321
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,600
What is that
supposed to mean?

322
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,300
Wow. These tomatoes
are really good.

323
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,900
They're like sunshine.
We're eating sunshine.

324
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,100
Mm.

325
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,800
But come on,

326
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,900
The guy is gonna go
down there to go

327
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,000
And see his ex-Girlfriend,
but relax.

328
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's not like he's gonna
get her pregnant again.

329
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,800
That's disgusting.
He would never cheat on me.

330
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,100
Yeah, you're right.
It's not eggy's style.

331
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,500
His name is not eggy.
It's egg salad.

332
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,400
Betty, are you okay?

333
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,100
No. It's henry.
It's henry.

334
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,900
Is it really hot in here?
'Cause i'm sweating.

335
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,000
You know,
for what it's rth,

336
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,800
You smell really good.

337
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,700
You smell really good, too.

338
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,600
Look, i told you i wasn't
trying to bribe judge heller.

339
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
I was just making change.

340
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,100
Big shot had to show everyone
he could break a $20.

341
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,200
Daniel, it's all right.
How screwed are we?

342
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,700
Ah, we're fine. I've never
lost a case, mrs. Meade,

343
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,600
And i don't intend
to start now.

344
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,900
Okay, i gotta be
honest with you.

345
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,400
I have lost
one case, in 2006,

346
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,200
And it just kills me
that i can't say

347
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,200
I've never
lost a case anymore.

348
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,200
Uh-Oh.
What's the matter?

349
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,900
Remember that one case
that i lost?

350
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,400
(Whispers) that's the judge.
Ladies and gentlemen,
good afternoon.

351
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,700
I am judge nancy biotch.

352
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,500
You've got to be kidding.

353
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,400
(Normal voice)
and she lives up to it.

354
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,800
I'm the new presiding judge
in this case.

355
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,100
I was supposed to be on my way
to the bahamas in an hour.

356
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,300
Instead i'm here.
Lucky me.

357
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,500
Oh, mr. Meade, should you
get itchy to buy

358
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,100
Another officer
of the court a coffee,

359
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,000
I'd love
a grande soy latte.

360
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:14,900
(Whispers) laugh.

361
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,400
So where are you
gonna be sleeping?

362
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,400
Are you staying
with charlie?

363
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,200
Because, you know,
i don't care.

364
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,000
You know what?
Don't even tell me.

365
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,500
You can sleep
with whoever you want.

366
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,900
Betty, no.
Of course not.

367
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,700
I would never do
anything like that--
Darn right you wouldn't.

368
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,000
Now promise
you'll call me tonight.
Okay.

369
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,000
Oh, but don't call me at home.
Use the bat phone.

370
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,100
I don't want my dad
listening in

371
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,100
Because i don't know
what i might say.
(Laughs)

372
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,200
Ava! What's up?
That's ava.

373
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,300
She's new in production.
We could be best friends.

374
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,300
I like her.
I like you.
Hi.

375
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,400
Oh, my god.
Look at those colors.

376
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,900
Oh, they're so... intense.

377
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,300
I never noticed that before.

378
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,100
I'm sorry.

379
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,400
Betty. Betty?
Are you okay?

380
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,500
You're acting
a little hyper,

381
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,600
And--And you're sweating.

382
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,100
No, i'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm great!

383
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:06,800
You know why?

384
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,200
Because i have the best,
most loyal boyfriend

385
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,300
In the whole world.
(Elevator bell dings)

386
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,200
Mmm.
Mmm.

387
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,400
Okay. Good-Bye.
I love you.
Okay.

388
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,000
Oh, did you have
that care package?
Got your care package

389
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,900
(Henry) mm. Betty. Mm.

390
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,100
Mm. Betty. Oh.

391
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,600
I love you, too.

392
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,400
Well, look who went
from flirty to dirty--Oh.

393
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,700
I don't care.
It felt good,

394
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,900
And if it feels good,
do it. Aah.
Oh.

395
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,400
Weird. Is there,
like, a echo in here?
Uh...

396
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,100
Hello!

397
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,700
Can you believe this?

398
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,500
Fey poisoned the perfume.
And bradford didn't know?

399
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,500
No. He gave it
to claire as a gift.

400
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,800
It was supposed to kill her,
but claire went nuts

401
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,000
And ended up killing
my mother first.
Oh, my god.

402
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,900
These pages would
exonerate claire meade.

403
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,900
They totally make her
look like the victim.
(Growls)

404
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,200
You're right.
(Whimpers)

405
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,100
Give it.

406
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,300
Mandy.

407
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,200
I'm not gonna let my dead mother
look like some psycho.

408
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,100
Wh--Wh--(Gasps)
(whimpers)

409
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,200
(Gasps) halston,
get back here.

410
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,700
Okay, marc,
you have to finish this.

411
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,300
And when i get back,
you're gonna tell me

412
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,600
What exonerate means.

413
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,700
Mandy, wait.
Halston! Wait.

414
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,200
Security is gonna
take you away again.

415
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,000
(Kiss) * i wanna
rock and roll all nite *

416
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,100

417
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,700
(Betty) * i wanna

418
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,900

419
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,600

420
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,900
(Betty) * i wanna

421
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,000
* all nite * whoo!
Oh.

422
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,800
Oh, man, i didn't sleep
at all last night.

423
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,600
I stayed up waiting
for henry to call.

424
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,300
He never called,
but i got to see

425
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,600
This molly ringwald marathon.
She is amazing.

426
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,400
"Pretty in pink,"
"sixteen candles"...

427
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,100
"Breakfast club."
"Breakfast club"--
I love that movie.

428
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,200
How did she not
win an oscar?
I know.

429
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,800
(Ignacio)
you didn't sleep at all?
Mm-Hmm.

430
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,000
Are you feeling okay?
I mean, yeah.
That's what's so weird.

431
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,900
I'm--I'm not sleepy.
I'm just--I'm itchy,

432
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,300
And i'm a little tingly,
and my mouth is really dry.

433
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,600
Whose juice is this?
That's mine.

434
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,600
Mmm. Mmm. Ahh.
What's for breakfast?

435
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,000
Huevos rancheros,
but a little different today.

436
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,800
I'm trying a new recipe.
Ugh. That's gross.
What else is there?

437
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,200
<i>Betty, papi worked
really hard on that.</i>

438
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,400
Oh, whatevs. I'll just see
what i can get at the office.

439
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,800
(Gasps) how about this?

440
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,100
Mmm.

441
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,500
Mmm. Mmm.
That should hold me over.

442
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,700
All right, gang.
A-B-C ya.

443
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,200
(Laughing) a-B-C ya.

444
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,200
What the hell
is wrong with her?

445
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,800
I don't know,
but i like it.

446
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,200
She's sassy.
(Door closes)

447
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,600
Mr. Meade, you admit
that at the time

448
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
Of fey sommers' murder,

449
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,900
Your mother
was drinking heavily.

450
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,300
Yes, but at the time, my father
was openly involved with--

451
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,100
Carrying on an affair.
Yes, it's sad, but legal.

452
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,100
What's not legal is murdering
your husband's lover.
Look, obviously my mother

453
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,800
She was terribly upset.
Yes, so upset that she arranged
to have fey sommers' brakes cut.

454
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,600
Objection. Spec--
(Gavel bangs)

455
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,900
I'll allow it.

456
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,200
Proceed.
Mm.

457
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,800
Okay. You're not
understanding me.

458
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,200
<i>Okay, the night before
fey's accident,</i>

459
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,700
My mother and i went to orso's
before the theater to--
Oh, my god!

460
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,800
Dinner before the theater.
She must have been insane.
(Laughter)

461
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,600
What were some
of the other warning signs

462
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,700
Of her supposed insanity,
huh? Red wine with fish?
No, i just mean,

463
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,300
She was paranoid.
She was behaving irrationally.

464
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,300
She was seeing things
that weren't even there.
So what you're

465
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,500
Is that your mother went
to a broadway show,

466
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,000
<i>Just hours after paying
someone to kill her rival.</i>

467
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,500
Does that sound
insane to you,

468
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,800
Or cold, calculating
and premeditated?

469
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,100
I got nothing. (Sighs)

470
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,900
<i>(Suzuki) * well,
sing a song for sing sing*</i>

471
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,500
<i>It was a disaster
this afternoon for the defense</i>

472
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,400
<i>As prosecutor ogden weitz,</i>

473
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,500
<i>In a crisp, classic
2-Button suit</i>

474
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,700
<i>And cavalli loafers,</i>

475
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,400
<i>Made hay
with poor daniel meade,</i>

476
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,100
<i>Who made
a rare fashion misstep.</i>

477
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,800
<i>Windsor knot
with a spread collar?</i>

478
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,300
<i>You're the one who should be
behind bars, danny boy.</i>

479
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,300
J'accuse.

480
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,400
Henry...

481
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,100
Call.

482
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,900
Call.

483
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,200
Calm down, betty.

484
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,800
Henry loves you.

485
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,900
Hey, betty.

486
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,500
I don't need it
right now, gio.

487
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,600
No, no, no, look.

488
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,900
I've been thinking
about it, and i just--

489
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,600
I want to apologize.

490
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,900
I should have never
said that egg salad

491
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,900
Was gonna do
anything wrong in tucson,

492
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,600
And i know
you don't like it,

493
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,000
So i'm not gonna call him
egg salad anymore,

494
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,600
Okay? It's henry.

495
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,300
Your boyfriend henry.

496
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
Thank you.

497
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,500
<i>So has henry checked in?</i>

498
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,600
What? Why?

499
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,400
You okay?
Yes. I'm fine.

500
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,500
Has he called?
No. No. No.

501
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,800
Henry hasn't called,

502
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,400
<i>And that's probably because
he's been very, very busy</i>

503
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,300
With his sonogram.

504
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,900
Yeah. Yeah,
you're probably right.

505
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,600
"You're probably right"?

506
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,800
"You're probably right"?
What does that mean?

507
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,000
What are you trying to say?
What are you saying?

508
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,200
That because henry
hasn't called,

509
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,300
He's probably sleeping
with charlie?

510
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,700
Is that what you're
trying to say?
No, betty. That's not

511
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,600
You know what, gio?

512
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,400
I am sick of you
coming up here to torture me.

513
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,000
I don't need it. So justo
and don't come back!

514
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,600
She wants to sell
a vintage couture gown

515
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,600
That jackie kennedy wore
at the white house?

516
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,900
I know. So stupid.
You can't just

517
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,100
Secretly auction off
a vintage dress.

518
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,700
She's never gonna sell it.
That's what i say.

519
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,700
She'll have a buyer
in ten minutes. It's genius.

520
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,200
Exactly.
Her an is perfect.

521
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,900
You know what
we have to do, marc?

522
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,400
Bid on it and then
take turns wearing it.

523
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,600
No, sweetheart.
Not this time.
Oh.

524
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,400
We have to make it
disaear.

525
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,500
I need christina
to carry that baby

526
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,400
I'm making
with bradford's sperm.

527
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,200
Without the dress, she might
be more open to my offer.

528
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,500
(Betty) i mean, god,

529
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,500
Can you believe that gio
would actually say that?

530
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,500
I mean, imply that henry would
cheat on me with charlie?

531
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,900
What a jerk!

532
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,600
Yeah, i just came to see
if you had any petty cash.

533
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,000
It's like everything he does--
Everything he says--

534
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,500
It just bugs me--
Gets under my skin, you know

535
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,900
He just bugs me so much.

536
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,100
Here.
Aah!

537
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,100
Is it hot in here?
I'm sweating. Ooh, sparkly.

538
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,600
Watch it, cheese fingers.

539
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,300
You know, the only reason
gio talks to you like that

540
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,100
Is because he has
a crush on you.

541
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,900
Eww. No. He does not.

542
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,500
I watch how he looks at you...
when i'm really bored.

543
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,600
Why? How does
he look at me?
It's just

544
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,900
I saw it with every single guy
i knew growing up

545
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,200
And their fathers...
and some of their mothers.

546
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,800
Well, i do not
have a crush on gio.

547
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,000
I only have a crush
on henry--

548
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,400
My perfect,
handsome boyfriend,

549
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,300
Who has not called me
in 12 hours.

550
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,700
Mmm.
What's that?

551
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,800
Perfume. Claire meade
gave it to me.

552
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,900
Henry likes
the way it smells,

553
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,400
So i wear it
to remind me of him.

554
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,100
You know what?

555
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,300
I don't care
if gio likes me,

556
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,600
Because i don't like him,

557
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,300
And i'm gonna tell him
to leave me alone

558
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,100
In a strongly worded note.

559
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,000
"Dear gio"...

560
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,200
"I hate that name
'cause i don't like you.

561
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,300
<i>You are not my friend."</i>

562
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,300
Gio. Betty.

563
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,000
Gio.

564
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,700
Gio, i have
something for you.

565
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,200
Gio.

566
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,300
I have something for you.

567
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,700
Don't ignore me.
Open this door right now.

568
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,300
This is so stupid.
Don't ignore me. Gio!

569
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,200
I need to talk to you.
I need to talk to you right now!

570
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,100
Oh!

571
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,300
Gio!

572
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,700
Betty? Betty?

573
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,000
What happened?

574
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,900
Where am i?

575
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,400
Oh, god.

576
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,200
I have
the biggest headache,

577
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,300
And my palms
e all sweaty.

578
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,900
Well, you'll see
the doctor,

579
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,500
And you'll find out
what's going on.

580
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,100
You sure you don't want me
to call your family?

581
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,500
No, no, just--No.
They'll worry too much.

582
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,600
(Bangs glass)
betty. Oh, my god.

583
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,400
(Gasps) are you okay?
I came as soon as i heard.
Whoa.

584
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,900
Aah. What? How did
you know i was here?

585
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,100
It's dr. Squassi.
His receptionist tina

586
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,200
Used to go out
with santos' friend tino.

587
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,300
Tina and tino, i know.

588
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,500
Anyway, she called me as soon
as she saw you were brought in.
Aah.

589
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,700
Hi, gio.
Fine, i just--
I hope you didn't tell--

590
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,800
<i>(Bangs glass
mija.
I can't believe this.</i>

591
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,200
Are you okay?
Grandpa pulled me out of gym.

592
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:24,900
(Whispers) thank you.

593
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,600
Guys, i'm fine.
You are not fine.
Look at me.

594
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,700
Yestday at breakfast,
i knew,

595
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,500
And i can see
in your eyes right now...

596
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,000
You're not yourself.

597
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,700
You look scared.

598
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,300
Oh.

599
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,000
Okay, now we have to do
this very quickly,

600
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,200
Because you shouldn't
really be in here.

601
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,900
I just need to see it.

602
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,300
If it's in the condition
you say it is,

603
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,700
I'll cut you
a check right here.

604
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,200
Oh, it's in mint condition.
Ahh.

605
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,900
Mm, it been boxed
ansealed

606
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,400
In acid-Free tissue paper.

607
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,900
Oh, it's--
It's extraordinary.

608
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,700
It's like a window
into a bygone era.

609
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,600
(Gasps)
oh, my god.

610
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,700
A dress
that was shredded?

611
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,300
I-I don't know what
you're talking about.

612
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,600
Marc?

613
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,500
Oh, i just got
a new crock-Pot,

614
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,400
So you know where
i was all day.

615
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,800
How could you?

616
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,100
I needed that money.

617
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,000
This is my husband's life.

618
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,300
Oh, i know.
It's terrible.

619
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,900
Well, lucky for you,

620
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,600
You have more
than one option.

621
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,900
But why me? I mean,
there's--There's thousands--

622
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,800
There's millions
of other women in this city--

623
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,800
<i>Because i want you,
christina.</i>

624
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,200
I need to know my partner
in this is someone i know

625
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,800
And can trust.

626
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,500
I've lost everything.

627
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,200
This child is
my entire life.

628
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,800
Think of our future--

629
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,400
For you and your husband,

630
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,500
For me and my baby.

631
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,100
And marc.

632
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,200
Mm.

633
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,600
Ah, you remember
my antonio--My baby?

634
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,900
(Muffled voice) ah, uh-Huh.

635
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,700
He's a sophomore at cornell.

636
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,100
He's studying
mechanical engineering.

637
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,200
They grow up so fast,
eh, ignacio?
Too fast.

638
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,300
Oh, my, my, my.
Uh, i-I think

639
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,600
<i>Betty and i
need to speak privately.
Ay, dios mío.</i>

640
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,700
(Hilda) ooh.
Here we go again.
Just like your sister.

641
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,700
Dad!
Oh, no, no, no.
That's not it.

642
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:20,400
Betty, is there something that
you need to talk to me about?
Well, what do you mean?

643
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,300
Well, your symptoms indicate
high levels of toxins

644
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,400
In your body.
Drugs?

645
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,000
(Ignacio) oh.

646
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,500
What? No. Wait. No.
That's impossible.

647
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,400
Well, you said you haven't
been yourself lately.

648
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,700
You're jittery, anxious,
overly emotional?

649
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,800
You did break in
to my deli.
Shut up.

650
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,200
What?
Your pupils are dilated.
Your glands are swollen.

651
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,100
Your heart rate
is above normal.

652
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,900
Dr. Squassi, this is me.

653
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,200
I don't do drugs.

654
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,100
I'm afraid of espresso.
(Chuckles)

655
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,300
Well, if you're not
taking drugs,

656
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,000
Someone is drugging you.

657
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,400
(Henry) betty, i'm on my way.

658
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,500
No, henry, you don't
have to come home early.

659
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,600
I'm fine.

660
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,500
Just hearing
your voice is enough.

661
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,400
I love you, too.

662
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,900
Aw.
Aw.

663
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,900
Soon as the blood work
comes back,

664
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,000
We'll know
what's going on.

665
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,700
Oh, my god,
would you listen to this?

666
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,700
I could so be on an episode
of "grey's anatomy" right now.
I miss addison so much.

667
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,500
I know.
Why'd she have to go do

668
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,300
That "private practice" thing?
I don't know.

669
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,900
Okay, well, we have
the, uh, report in.

670
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,100
You have high levels
of methyldexetrin

671
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,900
In your system,
and lower levels

672
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,100
Of linbin and fitzadent--
And--And this is very strange--

673
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,800
<i>Uh, traces
of bufo alvarius.</i>

674
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,100
<i>Bufo what?
It's toad venom.</i>

675
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,100
(Gasps) oh, snap, betty.
Your levels are
almost normal now,

676
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,500
And you won't have
any more effects,

677
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,400
But you're
a very lucky young lady

678
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,700
That we found this out in time.
Too much of it in your system--
What?

679
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,600
Well, it--It could lead to
hallucinations and paranoia.

680
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,100
Enough of it,
it could be fatal.
(Gasps)

681
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,700
Think, betty. Is there
anything you've done,

682
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,100
Anything you've eaten
differently

683
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,900
In the last few days?
No. No. I-I-Haven't.

684
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,500
I--Just--
Just the food at home,

685
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,600
And i did have one
of gio's sandwiches.

686
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,500
Hey.

687
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,000
My sandwiches
are all natural.

688
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,300
Wait.

689
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,300
Doctor, is it possible
to get drugged

690
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,000
By something that got
on my skin?

691
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,800
Why?

692
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,700
Excuse me!

693
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,500
Oh!

694
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Oh, god. Where'd it go?

695
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,200
Oh, god.

696
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,800
Betty, betty, betty,
where did you put it?

697
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,300
(Whispers) oh, god.

698
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,100
Sparkly.

699
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,300
Amanda.

700
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,800
You took my perfume.
No, i didn't.

701
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,700
Yes, you did.
Did not.

702
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,800
Did, too.
Okay, fine. I took it. But so
what? It wasn't even yours.

703
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,400
Amanda, that perfume
is evidence.

704
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,100
It could prove that
mrs. Meade was insane,

705
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,900
And it wasn't yours,
so just give it back.
Um, actually,

706
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,500
Who gave it to bradford,
who gave it to claire.

707
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,000
I read it in her diary.
Wait. What?

708
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
You mean, fey was
trying to poison claire?

709
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,800
Shh!
But claire went nuts,

710
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,000
And she killed
my mother first.
Oh, my god,

711
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,400
We have to get the perfume
to court and say that.

712
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,300
No way. Claire took
my mother's life,

713
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,600
And now i'm taking hers.
Amanda, she wasn't herself.

714
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,600
This bores me.

715
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,700
Well, forget about me.
Think about daniel.

716
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,400
You care about him,
don't you?

717
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,500
Amanda.

718
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,700
His mother
is going to jail

719
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,100
For something that
she would have never done.

720
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,000
You really want
to be responsible

721
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,800
For daniel losing his mother
for the rest of his life?

722
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,100
Amanda, look,
i know you're hurting

723
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,700
'Cause your mom is gone.

724
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,700
Trust me, i know
what that feels like.

725
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,100
But if i could keep
one person from feeling that,

726
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:49,900
I would.

727
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,500
Amanda, just give me
the perfume.

728
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,500
Um... are you
out of your mind?

729
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,400
No. Daniel,
this stuff is poison.

730
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,600
It seeped into my bloodstream
and it made me do

731
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,400
All these cry things.

732
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,100
Oh, my god.
Like your poor hair.

733
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,600
No. That's mine.

734
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,600
And i also have
my blood test to prove it.

735
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,200
Do you think
that's possible?

736
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,200
I-I-I was acting
so erratic.

737
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,900
I just assumed it was
the stress and the drinking.

738
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,500
No, it wasn't, mrs. Meade.
It wasn't you.

739
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,200
It was this stuff--
This perfume.

740
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,500
What do you think?
Is that really her hair?

741
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,500
(Daniel, alexis and claire)
yes.

742
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,900
Well, oh.
Well, it's worth a shot.

743
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,700
Here, let me see
the blood test.

744
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,600
Your honor,
the defense would like

745
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,700
To call betty suarez
to the stand.

746
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,000
And i only did
those things

747
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Because i had been
spraying myself

748
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,100
With this perfume
for the last two days.

749
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,800
Mrs. Meade used it
for six months.

750
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,100
Makes sense to me.

751
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,400
Thank you, ms. Suarez.
No further questions.

752
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,200
Prosecution, your witness.

753
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,400
Oh.

754
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,400
Ms. Suarez...

755
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,700
Why would bradford meade
give his wife poison perfume?

756
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,900
Um, well, no.

757
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,600
I-I don't think that mr. Meade
knew that it was poison.

758
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,000
Uh, fey sommers wrote
in her diary

759
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,700
That she
gave it to bradford

760
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,800
So that he would
give it to claire.

761
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,300
Ah, and where's
this mysterious diary now?

762
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,200
Um, i-I don't know.

763
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,700
I don't--
I don't have it.

764
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,700
Oh, and maybe
you're just being

765
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,200
A good assistant
to mr. Meade,

766
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,000
And maybe this perfume
isn't poison at all.

767
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,300
No. No, i'm not
a good assistant.

768
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,600
I mean--I mean, it--
This is poison.

769
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,600
I know because dr. Squassi,
my family doctor, said so.

770
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,300
Ah, well, you might
wanna get yourself

771
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,200
A new family doctor,

772
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,400
Because in just
the last few minutes,

773
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,400
The prosecution has had
this perfume tested.
I don't think

774
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,800
Oh, oh.

775
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,000
Oh, no.
(All gasping)

776
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,800
Call 9-1-1. I told you
not to do that!
(Moaning)

777
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,100
Oh, that's refreshing!

778
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,200
(Chuckles)
because guess what?

779
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,500
This so-Called
"poison perfume"

780
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,400
Is actually just water!

781
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,800
Settle down.
Straight from the tap.

782
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,700
That's impossible.
It has a scent.
(Sniffing)

783
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:26,200
My boyfriend said
he loved it.
Smells like water to me.

784
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,600
Thank you, ms. Suarez.

785
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,700
I don't understand.

786
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,900
This--This is the perfume.

787
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,900
Like i'd give her
the perfume.

788
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,100
Claire meade, you will
never see the light of day.

789
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,800
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

790
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,900
I-I really don't know
what happened.

791
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,500
I-I swear,
this perfume was real.

792
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,300
It's okay, betty.
It didn't hurt us.

793
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,600
He's right.
Thank you, betty.

794
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,700
I know how hard
you tried.
I'm sorry.

795
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,800
It's time i stood up there
and gave my side of the story.

796
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,700
Mandy, i can't deal
with anymore wickedness today.

797
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,900
I-I got to go.

798
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,100
I spend more time here now
than when i worked here.

799
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,700
Marc, come on.
What is wrong with you?

800
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,900
We'll just go to the west side,
and we'll throw it in the river,

801
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:30,000
And after,
we can cruise the bars.
Why do i have to go

802
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,100
Because you're a part
of this, remember?

803
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,900
You burned
those diary pages.
Ok, i do a lot

804
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,800
Of morally questionable things
for wilhelmina,

805
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,100
But none of it
is technically criminal,

806
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:42,100
And it's all in service
of my career.
Oh, and suddenly,

807
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,400
Actually, i never did.
No, when you first
got to "mode"?

808
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,200
You were the receptionist.
Yeah, and after that?

809
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,500
You were still
the receptionist.
I was never

810
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:52,500
Not for one minute.
Marc, just do it, okay?
Get rid of it.

811
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,800
Claire meade has to pay.
Why?

812
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,200
What?
Why does claire meade
have to pay?

813
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,700
She didn't do
anything wrong,

814
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,800
Except for use some perfume
that her husband gave her.

815
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,700
I can't do it, mandy.
I'm sorry.

816
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,400
And you wanna know
something else?

817
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,200
I couldn't
burn these, either.

818
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,000
I-I-I think there's
a reason you need me

819
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,900
To do these things
with you,

820
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,900
Because, deep down, you know
that your mother

821
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,900
Was responsible
for her own murder.

822
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,000
Claire meade is innocent.

823
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,900
Oh, wow.

824
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,200
Well, you're right.

825
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,600
(Laughs) maybe next time we can
get there without the slap.

826
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,300
(Laughs) thank you.

827
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,200
I see, mrs. Meade.

828
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,200
Well, then how would you
describe your state of mind

829
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,000
At the time
of fey sommers' death?

830
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,100
Not too peachy.

831
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,300
Peachy?

832
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,400
Well, were you
under the influence

833
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,300
Of any prescription painkillers
or antidepressants?

834
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,500
I-I was on
several medications.
Mm-Hmm.

835
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,600
I was having an extremely
difficult and emotional time.

836
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,200
My husband was having...
(cell phone vibrates)

837
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,500
A very public affair
with one of his employees.
Meet me in the hallway,cheese fingers

838
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,400
Do you know who
this employee was?
Yes, i do.

839
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,700
And her name?
Fey sommers.

840
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,000
What made you
change your mind?

841
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,700
Nothing they do
to claire meade

842
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,500
Is gonna
bring my mother back.

843
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,500
Thank you, amanda.

844
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,900
You did the right thing.

845
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,900
Feels good, doesn't it?

846
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,300
Eh, it'll pass.

847
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,600
I don't know what i would call
my state of mind.

848
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,800
