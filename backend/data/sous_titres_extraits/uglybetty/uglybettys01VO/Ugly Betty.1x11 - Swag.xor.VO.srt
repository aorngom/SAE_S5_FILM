1
00:00:06,322 --> 00:00:08,279
Hey! Ow!

2
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:12,833
Sorry. Didn't see you.

3
00:00:14,021 --> 00:00:16,161
Betty, is that-- is that you?

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,668
I came back to pack
the rest of my things.

5
00:00:18,678 --> 00:00:20,430
Amanda left them on the floor.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,047
Oh, considerate of her.

7
00:00:22,057 --> 00:00:24,322
Thought it'd be better
if I came back at night,

8
00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:26,363
in case I cried,

9
00:00:26,373 --> 00:00:28,449
but so far, no tears.

10
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:30,490
It's a new year, new job.

11
00:00:31,103 --> 00:00:33,727
It's just one floor down,
same building, same elevators.

12
00:00:33,736 --> 00:00:36,045
It's not like I'm never
gonna see any of you again.

13
00:00:36,054 --> 00:00:40,366
Still, I don't imagine
there's much swag at M.Y.W.

14
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,862
No.

15
00:00:42,695 --> 00:00:45,051
I'll definitely miss the perks.

16
00:00:50,657 --> 00:00:53,783
Anyway, you know, I should probably get
going. I don't wanna miss the train.

17
00:00:53,798 --> 00:00:56,853
I think you'll find the trains run all night.
Can I just have a quick look at that bag?

18
00:00:56,888 --> 00:01:00,510
You know what? It's holding up
so beautifully, the quality...

19
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:01,922
Give it here.

20
00:01:09,775 --> 00:01:11,353
This is a knockoff, isn't it?

21
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:12,453
Christina...

22
00:01:12,468 --> 00:01:14,911
This looks like the bag that
the guy sells on the corner.

23
00:01:15,935 --> 00:01:19,223
Oh, this is the bag that
the guy sells on the corner.

24
00:01:19,237 --> 00:01:22,253
- I love it all the same.
- Betty, what happened to the Gucci?

25
00:01:22,266 --> 00:01:24,661
Nothing... bad.

26
00:01:24,675 --> 00:01:27,532
Nothing good,
if it's not hanging from your shoulder.

27
00:01:27,726 --> 00:01:29,090
Well, I can explain.

28
00:01:29,108 --> 00:01:30,493
Right. Start now.

29
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:32,580
Okay... okay.

30
00:01:32,597 --> 00:01:37,730
So... well, it all started with
the stampede. Four months ago...

31
00:01:49,427 --> 00:01:50,851
No, I gotta go.

32
00:01:52,316 --> 00:01:53,681
Did I miss it?

33
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:57,743
Crap! Crap, crap! Crap!

34
00:01:57,995 --> 00:01:59,873
Dignity, Amanda.

35
00:02:01,695 --> 00:02:03,812
I guess it's too
late for that now.

36
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:06,872
Prada trumps passion, Daniel.

37
00:02:07,137 --> 00:02:09,202
Christina just posted
the sign-up sheet.

38
00:02:09,217 --> 00:02:10,482
Sign-up sheet?

39
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:12,671
She's cleaning the
closet tomorrow--

40
00:02:12,685 --> 00:02:16,302
the winter fashions from the last three
issues. Christina needs to get rid of them

41
00:02:16,315 --> 00:02:18,722
to make room for the spring
collections coming in.

42
00:02:18,736 --> 00:02:21,523
Freebie couture is
the staff perk.

43
00:02:21,535 --> 00:02:23,883
You know, you really should
take a trip down there, Betty.

44
00:02:23,897 --> 00:02:27,180
They might have some...
socks in your size.

45
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:29,990
Okay.

46
00:02:30,008 --> 00:02:31,653
That the stuff on Oshi?

47
00:02:31,807 --> 00:02:32,901
Yes.

48
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:35,733
Back issues with his fall
and winter collections,

49
00:02:35,747 --> 00:02:39,633
a profile from last february's
interview and his autobiography.

50
00:02:39,647 --> 00:02:40,783
He has an autobiography?

51
00:02:40,795 --> 00:02:43,353
"Oshi on Oshi," by Oshi.

52
00:02:45,345 --> 00:02:47,871
I think those are supposed
to be his glasses.

53
00:02:48,056 --> 00:02:51,072
Super-sized icon of
minimal fashion, Oshi,

54
00:02:51,085 --> 00:02:53,841
will be steamrolling
into Gotham tomorrow

55
00:02:53,858 --> 00:02:57,010
to unveil his spring collection
to the editors of "Mode,"

56
00:02:57,026 --> 00:03:00,502
where he debuted his
collections for years,

57
00:03:00,517 --> 00:03:03,550
due to his extremely
close friendship

58
00:03:03,565 --> 00:03:06,280
with former editor-in-chief,
Fey Sommers.

59
00:03:06,298 --> 00:03:10,852
Fey's tragic death in a
fiery car crash last month

60
00:03:10,867 --> 00:03:12,953
left him devastated.

61
00:03:12,966 --> 00:03:17,270
Fey was so... minimal.

62
00:03:19,296 --> 00:03:21,830
And now the question
on everybody's mind--

63
00:03:21,846 --> 00:03:25,441
will the fashion heavyweight hit
it off with Fey's replacement,

64
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,400
himbo playboy Daniel Meade?

65
00:03:28,415 --> 00:03:30,800
I'm thinking no-shi.

66
00:03:30,816 --> 00:03:33,210
Well, I'm thinking yes-shi.

67
00:03:33,498 --> 00:03:35,152
Thanks, I appreciate
that, Betty,

68
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:37,033
but we need Oshi business,

69
00:03:37,046 --> 00:03:40,110
and I have nothing in common with
the man, I don't speak japanese,

70
00:03:40,126 --> 00:03:43,351
I don't wear white, I have never
eaten an entire shark at one meal.

71
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:44,800
He'll love you, Daniel.

72
00:03:44,815 --> 00:03:46,771
It's all about relationships
with the japanese.

73
00:03:46,785 --> 00:03:48,730
My  first meal with
him has to be perfect.

74
00:03:48,746 --> 00:03:51,140
Well, you have the chef's table
at Masa on wednesday night

75
00:03:51,156 --> 00:03:53,053
- at 8:00 p.m...
- Oh, I love their uni.

76
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:55,982
And I got you this japanese
customs and phrase book.

77
00:03:55,995 --> 00:03:59,183
You should also know that your
credit card was rejected.

78
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:02,023
- That's my personal card.
- That's the one you gave me.

79
00:04:02,036 --> 00:04:04,580
Betty, you always use the
company card for business.

80
00:04:04,595 --> 00:04:07,203
That reminds me-- you're gonna take
care of my expense report, right?

81
00:04:07,237 --> 00:04:09,041
- Expense report?
- Yeah, Henry something-or-other

82
00:04:09,075 --> 00:04:11,550
from accounting sent us a memo,
says it was due today.

83
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:13,492
Today? No, I didn't get this.

84
00:04:13,507 --> 00:04:15,333
Well, it says you were copied.

85
00:04:15,686 --> 00:04:17,692
No. No, I didn't get this.

86
00:04:17,706 --> 00:04:20,013
Well, get on it.
My father's a hard-ass on expenses,

87
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:22,713
and the company's not gonna
reimburse me if we turn that in late.

88
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:26,153
Accounting is giving us till 10:30
tomorrow morning to get it in--period.

89
00:04:26,168 --> 00:04:28,822
- No exceptions.
- But do you have any receipts?

90
00:04:31,586 --> 00:04:33,832
You know what to do
with them, right?

91
00:04:33,895 --> 00:04:35,140
Payroll.

92
00:04:38,218 --> 00:04:39,892
- Mr. Meade...
- Thank you.

93
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,562
- And you are?
- Betty Suarez.

94
00:04:44,155 --> 00:04:46,682
- This is my first paycheck.
- Mine, too.

95
00:04:47,168 --> 00:04:49,171
- What the...
- F.I.C.A.?

96
00:04:49,187 --> 00:04:52,563
Now Manny Epstein was a good publisher
when Fey was running the show.

97
00:04:52,575 --> 00:04:55,820
She was, however,
fiscally responsible.

98
00:04:55,835 --> 00:05:00,293
Daniel... well,
Daniel needs stronger supervision.

99
00:05:00,515 --> 00:05:02,951
He's a little indulged,
but he's growing up.

100
00:05:02,965 --> 00:05:05,391
He ran through his trust
fund in three years.

101
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:09,631
For his 28th birthday,
he tried to buy an island... and J-Lo.

102
00:05:09,645 --> 00:05:11,130
Shakira.

103
00:05:11,198 --> 00:05:13,560
They were wild oats.
He's turned the corner.

104
00:05:13,578 --> 00:05:15,500
We're talking about
a magazine, Bradford.

105
00:05:15,517 --> 00:05:17,313
Why would you want
the publisher's job?

106
00:05:17,325 --> 00:05:20,450
It's financial--budgets,
ad sales.

107
00:05:20,468 --> 00:05:21,451
You're creative.

108
00:05:21,468 --> 00:05:25,591
I never said I'd give up my creative
title, just add "publisher" to it.

109
00:05:25,608 --> 00:05:28,073
Better to keep
Daniel reined in.

110
00:05:28,088 --> 00:05:30,893
I'd rather you concentrated
on the job at hand--

111
00:05:30,907 --> 00:05:33,943
helping Daniel establish
a relationship with Oshi.

112
00:05:33,957 --> 00:05:36,403
His exclusives are
worth millions to us.

113
00:05:36,415 --> 00:05:38,200
Oh, he'll make an impression.

114
00:05:39,016 --> 00:05:40,592
I guarantee it.

115
00:05:41,848 --> 00:05:44,080
The Gucci shoulder bag is mine!

116
00:05:44,097 --> 00:05:47,122
Nice, but over it. Those Louboutin
boots, on the other hand...

117
00:05:47,137 --> 00:05:49,521
As if you stand a
chance of getting them.

118
00:05:49,536 --> 00:05:51,430
- I can trade.
- With what?

119
00:05:51,445 --> 00:05:53,281
You're last on the list.

120
00:05:53,298 --> 00:05:55,733
All that'll be left are those
gag-awful Pucci scarves.

121
00:05:55,746 --> 00:05:59,233
I, on the other hand,
have the pick of the closet,

122
00:05:59,245 --> 00:06:02,250
and numero uno picks
the glorious "it" bag

123
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:04,062
from the house of Gucci.

124
00:06:04,077 --> 00:06:05,930
Why would you need
a pocketbook?

125
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:10,121
I need it to trade.
At "Mode," fashion is currency.

126
00:06:10,135 --> 00:06:13,040
I know that's hard for you to understand,
because you're so very much in debt,

127
00:06:13,077 --> 00:06:16,530
but, for instance, 
if I needed a favor from you,

128
00:06:16,546 --> 00:06:18,851
like an invitation to a
Marc Jacobs dinner party,

129
00:06:18,868 --> 00:06:22,661
then I might be persuaded to trade
that favor for my fabulous Gucci bag,

130
00:06:22,678 --> 00:06:24,943
which you so desperately need.

131
00:06:31,335 --> 00:06:32,833
Loiter much?

132
00:06:32,847 --> 00:06:37,093
Oh, um, I need some help,
if you wouldn't mind.

133
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,561
Ah! You need a favor.

134
00:06:40,575 --> 00:06:42,623
Yes, I guess a favor.

135
00:06:42,685 --> 00:06:46,311
Um,  I seem to be late in getting
in Daniel's expense report,

136
00:06:46,325 --> 00:06:49,182
and I don't know why I didn't
get the memo from accounting.

137
00:06:49,195 --> 00:06:51,860
Hmm,  must have been
lost in the mailroom.

138
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:52,882
Oops.

139
00:06:52,897 --> 00:06:55,271
And I'm kind of lost
on how to do it.

140
00:06:55,305 --> 00:06:57,601
Marc'll be happy to help you.
Won't you, Marc?

141
00:06:57,616 --> 00:07:01,643
Please give Betty the correct form,
and then give her a copy of our repo.

142
00:07:01,657 --> 00:07:04,741
If she does what we did,
she'll be fine.

143
00:07:08,906 --> 00:07:13,420
You realize this means an
unnamed favor at a later date.

144
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:15,677
I understand.

145
00:07:16,086 --> 00:07:17,635
Thank you.

146
00:07:17,884 --> 00:07:19,596
- Ta.
- Ta.

147
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:23,430
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

148
00:07:23,447 --> 00:07:25,133
It's Betty's memo.

149
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:29,652
Those boys in the mailroom--
cute, but so careless.

150
00:07:32,158 --> 00:07:33,483
Nice bag.

151
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:34,851
Oh, thank you.

152
00:07:34,868 --> 00:07:37,652
So... Juan Valdez.

153
00:07:38,178 --> 00:07:40,173
Did it come with a mule?

154
00:07:41,255 --> 00:07:44,321
- Christina!
- You look fabulous...

155
00:07:45,386 --> 00:07:46,943
Sod off!

156
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,772
Four times a year,
I'm everybody's best friend.

157
00:07:49,785 --> 00:07:52,271
Well, nobody is moving
up the list, okay?

158
00:07:52,286 --> 00:07:55,053
Nobody, and that
includes you, Amanda.

159
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:58,891
I was late signing up
because of my job.

160
00:07:58,905 --> 00:08:02,162
Oh, and we all know what kind
of job you were giving-- doing.

161
00:08:02,257 --> 00:08:05,241
Well, where were you?
I'd have let you cut the queue.

162
00:08:05,258 --> 00:08:08,263
Christina, you don't have
anything larger than a size 6.

163
00:08:08,275 --> 00:08:10,012
I have accessories.

164
00:08:10,168 --> 00:08:12,982
I know it sounds stupid,
but I'm just not that into fashion.

165
00:08:12,997 --> 00:08:14,710
Forget the fashion.
Did you get your paycheck?

166
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:18,032
Yes, and I spent, like,
half of it on a slice of pizza.

167
00:08:18,047 --> 00:08:19,703
They take so much out.

168
00:08:19,718 --> 00:08:21,952
That's why you need the
swag from the closet.

169
00:08:21,965 --> 00:08:23,600
- Swag?
- The goodies.

170
00:08:23,615 --> 00:08:25,380
Gotta start thinking of
it as part of your wages.

171
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,561
Look.

172
00:08:26,576 --> 00:08:30,532
Don't you just love it?
Now that is the "it" bag of the season.

173
00:08:30,545 --> 00:08:31,680
It's true art.

174
00:08:31,698 --> 00:08:35,462
Look at the way the buckles offset
the pattern. It just slays me.

175
00:08:35,477 --> 00:08:38,381
You know, my mom used to
have a bag just like this.

176
00:08:38,395 --> 00:08:40,711
She gave it to me when I was,
like, 3.

177
00:08:40,726 --> 00:08:43,121
I used to carry
my crayons in it.

178
00:08:43,808 --> 00:08:46,140
Made my sister furious.

179
00:08:46,297 --> 00:08:48,070
Hey, lovely ladies.

180
00:08:48,085 --> 00:08:50,511
200 bucks, and you can't
tell it from the real thing.

181
00:08:50,526 --> 00:08:52,111
Yeah, he can't tell
it from a Gucci.

182
00:08:52,126 --> 00:08:54,970
Believe me, you walkin to "Mode" with
a knockoff, you might as well walk in

183
00:08:55,008 --> 00:08:57,541
with a cow bladder.
Everybody knows.

184
00:08:58,165 --> 00:09:00,633
He did all this
damage in a month?

185
00:09:00,645 --> 00:09:04,041
Well, dad, he's an editor-in-chief.
He's gotta entertain people.

186
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:05,980
- What's Bow-oo-lay?
- Bouley--

187
00:09:05,996 --> 00:09:07,993
only the hottest
restaurant in Tribeca.

188
00:09:08,008 --> 00:09:10,182
He spent $821 on dinner.

189
00:09:10,195 --> 00:09:13,211
Ooh! Next time we go to the chicken
place, I'm ordering all white meat,

190
00:09:13,225 --> 00:09:14,932
- and I don't wanna hear about it.
- You guys don't understand.

191
00:09:14,966 --> 00:09:18,552
This is business. He's entertaining
models and advertisers and designers,

192
00:09:18,565 --> 00:09:20,980
- and what's that say on the back?
- It's a blank.

193
00:09:21,256 --> 00:09:23,500
Another miscellaneous expense.

194
00:09:23,517 --> 00:09:25,742
There's a lot of
miscellaneous expenses.

195
00:09:25,758 --> 00:09:28,953
I guess that's fine. Most of Wilhelmina's
expenses are miscellaneous, too.

196
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:30,413
Says she went to Rio.

197
00:09:30,426 --> 00:09:32,603
Yeah, she's the creative director.
It was a fashion shoot.

198
00:09:32,637 --> 00:09:33,873
It was in the last issue.

199
00:09:33,887 --> 00:09:38,702
Oh, $25,000 to Casa Brazil
for props and extras?

200
00:09:38,716 --> 00:09:41,071
Ay, dios, and they haven't
given you a paycheck yet?

201
00:09:41,087 --> 00:09:42,953
Well, actually,
they gave it to me today.

202
00:09:42,967 --> 00:09:44,381
And?

203
00:09:49,438 --> 00:09:52,601
Someone is blowing
25 grand in Rio,

204
00:09:52,617 --> 00:09:54,302
and this is what
they're paying you?

205
00:09:54,316 --> 00:09:56,671
She's not doing it for the money, Hilda.
It's an opportunity.

206
00:09:56,706 --> 00:10:01,403
Well, maybe you should get another
job to support your opportunity.

207
00:10:01,627 --> 00:10:03,092
Ay, dios mío.

208
00:10:03,107 --> 00:10:04,892
They take so much out.

209
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,181
Well, it's still
a paycheck, Betty.

210
00:10:08,196 --> 00:10:10,130
It's more than I made
on my first job.

211
00:10:10,406 --> 00:10:12,321
Vamos. Come on.

212
00:10:12,335 --> 00:10:13,690
Novela's waiting.

213
00:10:15,845 --> 00:10:16,823
Betty...

214
00:10:19,797 --> 00:10:22,423
we have to make some
serious cutbacks.

215
00:10:23,118 --> 00:10:25,462
The pharma wouldn't fill
his prescription today.

216
00:10:25,476 --> 00:10:26,653
What?

217
00:10:27,045 --> 00:10:30,850
Maria Ortiz--she can't do that.
She knows he needs his pills to work.

218
00:10:30,867 --> 00:10:32,760
He has arrhythmia.
He could die.

219
00:10:32,776 --> 00:10:34,141
It wasn't Maria.

220
00:10:34,157 --> 00:10:37,430
It's his H.M.O.
They're not gonna cover him anymore.

221

223
00:10:51,348 --> 00:10:54,253
So this was around the time
Walter and I were broken up.

224
00:10:54,265 --> 00:10:56,240
You remember how he
was stalking me?

225
00:11:07,095 --> 00:11:08,973
Stop following me, Walter!

226
00:11:08,985 --> 00:11:10,790
I have something for you.

227
00:11:10,806 --> 00:11:13,410
I don't need any more batteries,
thank you.

228
00:11:13,425 --> 00:11:15,152
It's a universal remote.

229
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,221
We only have one TV.

230
00:11:17,238 --> 00:11:18,812
Now leave me alone.

231
00:11:24,786 --> 00:11:27,853
- Walter...
- I'm going to get you back, Betty.

232
00:11:27,865 --> 00:11:29,571
Not by stalking me.

233
00:11:29,696 --> 00:11:32,421
You cheated on me, Walter.
You cheated on me

234
00:11:32,438 --> 00:11:35,090
with Gina Gambarro.
Do you even understand what that means?

235
00:11:35,105 --> 00:11:38,390
I don't care how many
universal remotes you give me.

236
00:11:38,886 --> 00:11:41,043
There's no winning me back.

237
00:11:45,815 --> 00:11:48,531
Your father's H.M.O.
file is under investigation.

238
00:11:48,547 --> 00:11:49,942
What kind of investigation?

239
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,673
I don't know.
They don't tell me those things.

240
00:11:51,707 --> 00:11:53,693
All I know is that they refuse
to cover his prescription

241
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:55,521
until the matter's resolved.

242
00:11:57,527 --> 00:12:00,143
Maria, my father
needs his medication.

243
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:02,283
Did I say he couldn't
have his medication?

244
00:12:02,297 --> 00:12:05,652
- You pay me $197, and they--
- Walter.

245
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:07,541
Wha--what? I'm shopping.

246
00:12:07,556 --> 00:12:10,110
No, you do not have
a feminine itch.

247
00:12:12,236 --> 00:12:15,003
I don't have $197.

248
00:12:15,018 --> 00:12:16,832
Well, don't they
pay you at "Mode"?

249
00:12:16,848 --> 00:12:18,532
Not enough.

250
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,981
So I'm suppose to give you your
father's prescription gratis, huh?

251
00:12:21,995 --> 00:12:24,460
That's how my father and I are
supposed to stay in business?

252
00:12:24,475 --> 00:12:25,870
Get--

253
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:35,580
Can you really blame him for
trying on Gina Gambarro?

254
00:12:49,095 --> 00:12:50,233
B etty!

255
00:12:50,245 --> 00:12:51,710
Ms. Suarez.

256
00:12:54,658 --> 00:12:56,042
Mr. Meade? 

257
00:12:56,057 --> 00:12:58,060
I need to see you this morning.

258
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:01,212
- Me?
- My office, 10:30 sharp.

259
00:13:01,225 --> 00:13:03,390
Yes, sir, 10:30 sharp.

260
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,253
And, Betty,
I don't want anyone to know,

261
00:13:06,266 --> 00:13:07,890
especially Daniel.

262
00:13:20,985 --> 00:13:23,132
You know,
you could just bow a lot.

263
00:13:23,525 --> 00:13:25,413
Your expense report--you
need to sign it.

264
00:13:25,428 --> 00:13:28,083
So Oshi lands at 8:00.
He's staying at the...

265
00:13:28,097 --> 00:13:31,451
The  Asia on park, in the penthouse.
I've ordered the flowers.

266
00:13:31,468 --> 00:13:32,983
White dendrobium orchids?

267
00:13:32,997 --> 00:13:35,152
- Red roses.
- He hates color.

268
00:13:35,165 --> 00:13:37,063
Veuve Laurent brut?

269
00:13:38,508 --> 00:13:40,140
It's champagne.

270
00:13:40,156 --> 00:13:43,510
Five bottles at least--he
brushes his teeth with it.

271
00:13:43,527 --> 00:13:46,011
I appreciate your help,
Wilhelmina, but this is my dinner,

272
00:13:46,028 --> 00:13:48,810
my meeting,
my chance to get to know Oshi.

273
00:13:49,726 --> 00:13:51,621
You're not invited.

274
00:13:52,105 --> 00:13:54,913
Did Marc help you with
the expense report?

275
00:13:54,925 --> 00:13:57,241
Yes, thank you.

276
00:13:58,435 --> 00:14:02,740
No thanks needed. Just make sure
Oshi's limo is a white stretch.

277
00:14:03,546 --> 00:14:06,123
Oh, and, Betty...
make sure to get that down

278
00:14:06,135 --> 00:14:07,733
- to accounting by--
- 10:30.

279
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:09,853
Oh, and can you pick me up a
coffee and a bagel, white--

280
00:14:09,885 --> 00:14:12,731
Yeah, two sugars,
water bagel with cream cheese. Got it.

281
00:14:12,747 --> 00:14:15,103
And... I need you to front me the cash.
I'm out.

282
00:14:15,118 --> 00:14:18,441
Oh, um... yeah, okay.

283
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:25,383
Back off, Shaquille,
these are women's boots.

284
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,330
I'm number seven on the
sign-up sheet, honey.

285
00:14:27,348 --> 00:14:28,900
Better luck next time.

286
00:14:28,947 --> 00:14:30,563
Christina!

287
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,192
There was a Gucci bag in the
august issue. I know you have it.

288
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,021
Well, it must be somewhere in
the accessory closet, love.

289
00:14:35,056 --> 00:14:36,653
I looked in the
accessory closet, "love."

290
00:14:36,687 --> 00:14:38,251
Well, it must be still
on the floor, love.

291
00:14:38,287 --> 00:14:41,280
- It's not on the floor, "love."
- Then pick something else, love!

292
00:14:42,436 --> 00:14:44,863
- This is my hell.
- It's Betty.

293
00:14:44,878 --> 00:14:47,040
- Is Amanda there?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

294
00:14:47,055 --> 00:14:49,331
She's got the blonde from
styles in a headlock.

295
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,810
- Why aren't you here?
- Because I have things to do,

296
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:53,771
and I need Amanda to
cover Daniel's phone.

297
00:14:53,785 --> 00:14:56,101
If I see anyone leaving
here with that Gucci bag,

298
00:14:56,116 --> 00:14:57,993
I will club them
with this boot.

299
00:14:58,008 --> 00:15:00,522
I'm serious, Betty.
It's a feeding frenzy.

300
00:15:00,537 --> 00:15:03,712
And if you want anything at all from the
closet, you've got to get down here now.

301
00:15:03,745 --> 00:15:06,351
Okay, maybe later. Just please
get Amanda up here, Christina.

302
00:15:06,368 --> 00:15:08,110
I have to go. Bye.

303
00:15:09,266 --> 00:15:12,063
So then I ran down to accounting,
and that's where I met...

304
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,672
- Henry?
- Yes?

305
00:15:16,605 --> 00:15:17,960
Here.

306
00:15:18,368 --> 00:15:22,312
Oh, well,
you certainly like to cut it close.

307
00:15:22,328 --> 00:15:24,561
- Yeah, I didn't get the memo.
- Well, you were on the list.

308
00:15:24,595 --> 00:15:28,762
I didn't get it. My boss did,
last night, so here it is. Um...

309
00:15:29,755 --> 00:15:31,521
Do you take your coffee
with cream and sugar?

310
00:15:31,558 --> 00:15:32,321
Yeah.

311
00:15:32,337 --> 00:15:33,651
Any cream cheese?

312
00:15:33,665 --> 00:15:35,223
Excuse me?

313
00:15:35,855 --> 00:15:38,162
I'm sorry.
I'll make it up to you later.

314
00:15:39,697 --> 00:15:42,143
Hi, Mr. Meade.
Uh, I'm sorry I'm late.

315
00:15:42,155 --> 00:15:44,393
Uh, the first elevator was full,
so I had to wait for the second one--

316
00:15:44,427 --> 00:15:46,780
I hope those are for me.
I skipped breakfast.

317
00:15:47,887 --> 00:15:50,580
Yeah. Uh... sure.

318
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:54,551
Here you go.

319
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,363
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

320
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:58,501
Please.

321
00:15:59,055 --> 00:16:00,531
- Okay.
- No cream cheese?

322
00:16:00,545 --> 00:16:02,081
No, they were out.

323
00:16:02,706 --> 00:16:05,783
So do you have any
idea why you're here?

324
00:16:07,937 --> 00:16:12,141
Sir, it was just one pack of post-its.
I swear I will bring it back.

325
00:16:12,158 --> 00:16:13,352
I love my job.

326
00:16:13,366 --> 00:16:15,021
It's not about post-its.

327
00:16:15,037 --> 00:16:16,271
It's not?

328
00:16:16,286 --> 00:16:18,693
It's about
fiscal responsibility.

329
00:16:18,706 --> 00:16:20,492
Well, I only overdrew
my bank account once.

330
00:16:20,508 --> 00:16:23,220
Daniel's, not yours.

331
00:16:23,236 --> 00:16:27,440
Some people are questioning his
ability to handle company finances.

332
00:16:27,456 --> 00:16:30,771
He's had...
some problems in the past.

333
00:16:30,986 --> 00:16:34,750
Well, I just turned in his expense
report. It seemed fine to me.

334
00:16:34,768 --> 00:16:36,182
Protect him, Betty.

335
00:16:36,197 --> 00:16:39,312
If you see him do anything out of line,
let me know.

336
00:16:39,627 --> 00:16:41,291
Yes, sir.

337
00:16:41,307 --> 00:16:42,991
Oh, and, Betty,

338
00:16:43,008 --> 00:16:45,443
he doesn't need to 
know we're doing this.

339
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,101
Our secret.

340
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:51,142
Just remember who
signs your paychecks.

341
00:16:51,615 --> 00:16:52,960
Okay.

342
00:16:53,386 --> 00:16:56,312
But might I just say,
you take out a lot?

343
00:17:00,877 --> 00:17:03,660
Hey, Betty,
Daniel's been calling around for you.

344
00:17:03,678 --> 00:17:05,363
He isn't happy.

345
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:11,043
You want to tell me
where you've been?

346
00:17:11,058 --> 00:17:13,153
I  was trying to
get your bagel...

347
00:17:14,857 --> 00:17:16,520
Did you find some cream cheese?

348
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,211
Oh, gee. Look, I'm sorry, um...

349
00:17:19,228 --> 00:17:21,851
I was in such a rush,
and my boss wanted a bagel

350
00:17:21,867 --> 00:17:24,431
and some coffee, and I was gonna
make it up to you, really--

351
00:17:24,508 --> 00:17:27,002
This is not about coffee
and a bagel, Betty!

352
00:17:27,018 --> 00:17:28,971
- Really?
- I wish,

353
00:17:28,985 --> 00:17:31,490
but it's about the expense
report you turned in.

354
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:35,891
Henry here has rejected $20,000
of miscellaneous expenses,

355
00:17:35,905 --> 00:17:38,522
every dime of which I am
personally responsible.

356
00:17:38,537 --> 00:17:40,720
You wanna--what
were you thinking?

357
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:47,523
Miscellaneous expense?
Miscellaneous expense.

358
00:17:47,536 --> 00:17:50,443
You need to put names,
dates, reasons for the meal.

359
00:17:50,456 --> 00:17:53,181
Yeah, but I just--
I copied Wilhelmina's report.

360
00:17:53,196 --> 00:17:56,612
Betty, miscellaneous expense reports
are always meticulously detailed.

361
00:17:56,626 --> 00:17:58,732
Of course they are.
I mean, Wilhelmina knows

362
00:17:58,746 --> 00:18:01,453
exactly how this makes
me look to my father.

363
00:18:01,468 --> 00:18:03,223
Does he get copies?

364
00:18:03,238 --> 00:18:05,211
Instantly, whenever
there's a large violation.

365
00:18:05,226 --> 00:18:07,150
The server sends it,
then automatically suspends

366
00:18:07,168 --> 00:18:08,891
the company credit
card of the violator.

367
00:18:08,907 --> 00:18:10,340
Seriously?

368
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,721
My card's suspended?

369
00:18:12,738 --> 00:18:14,752
It only takes a
week to reactivate.

370
00:18:14,765 --> 00:18:19,013
A week? No.
I have a huge dinner tomorrow night.

371
00:18:21,578 --> 00:18:24,191
Betty, phone?

372
00:18:27,886 --> 00:18:29,851
Daniel Meade's office.

373
00:18:30,205 --> 00:18:31,822
Yes, sir.

374
00:18:33,247 --> 00:18:35,302
Yeah, I'll tell him.

375
00:18:39,016 --> 00:18:40,572
That's your father.

376
00:18:41,897 --> 00:18:45,480
$20,000 of
miscellaneous expenses?

377
00:18:46,165 --> 00:18:50,901
Yesterday I defended your fiscal
responsibility to Wilhelmina Slater.

378
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:54,390
She's gunning for publisher.
You know that?

379
00:18:54,978 --> 00:18:58,173
She thinks you need
financial supervision.

380
00:18:58,187 --> 00:18:59,072
Is she right?

381
00:18:59,086 --> 00:19:01,672
No, sir... not from her.

382
00:19:01,687 --> 00:19:03,512
I'm not so sure.

383
00:19:04,318 --> 00:19:06,942
I think you've gone
soft on my money.

384
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:09,511
I think you've got
something to prove to me.

385
00:19:09,976 --> 00:19:11,731
So here's what I'm gonna do--

386
00:19:11,746 --> 00:19:15,122
I'm gonna eat the 20 grand,
call it an accounting error.

387
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:16,350
Thank you.

388
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:19,070
But this month,
you're gonna use your own money.

389
00:19:19,315 --> 00:19:23,251
See how responsible you are when
it's coming out of your own pocket.

390
00:19:24,225 --> 00:19:27,661
Oh, that's terrible.
Did Bradford say anything to you?

391
00:19:27,676 --> 00:19:28,852
He said...

392
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:33,310
Some people are questioning Daniel's
ability to handle company finances.

393
00:19:33,326 --> 00:19:36,092
He's had some
problems in the past.

394
00:19:36,107 --> 00:19:38,272
And that was just the
tip of the iceberg...

395
00:19:38,285 --> 00:19:42,061
You only have $327
left in your account?

396
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:43,533
But you're a Meade.

397
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:44,951
A poor Meade.

398
00:19:44,966 --> 00:19:48,451
I blew through my trust fund
like--like-- I was Michael Jackson.

399
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:51,801
- I need this job, Betty.
- Well, you just got paid.

400
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:54,090
It barely covered
the rent on my loft.

401
00:19:54,608 --> 00:19:57,533
I've been living off the
company credit card, okay?

402
00:19:57,547 --> 00:19:58,951
I'm broke.

403
00:19:59,055 --> 00:20:01,523
You have to entertain
Oshi tomorrow night.

404
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:03,913
Maybe you should just
tell your father.

405
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:07,071
What, and look
fiscally irresponsible?

406
00:20:07,087 --> 00:20:08,833
If I tell dad that's
all I have left,

407
00:20:08,845 --> 00:20:12,283
he'll make Wilhelmina publisher so fast,
it'll make your head spin,

408
00:20:12,297 --> 00:20:15,761
and it'd be like handing the
magazine over to her. No.

409
00:20:15,777 --> 00:20:17,651
This is our secret.

410
00:20:17,668 --> 00:20:20,073
Okay, yeah.
Yeah, we can work our way out of this.

411
00:20:20,088 --> 00:20:22,132
It's like my dad always says,
"it's not how much you have.

412
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,742
It's how you spend it."

413
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:25,810
We'll think of something.

414
00:20:27,548 --> 00:20:31,303
I don't know how that phony
expense report got into my files.

415
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:34,941
I'm furious at you, Marc.
See that it never happens again.

416
00:20:36,098 --> 00:20:39,401
Oh, the witch and her
flying monkey set you up.

417
00:20:39,418 --> 00:20:41,233
Yeah, I get that now.

418
00:20:41,347 --> 00:20:44,113
Publisher? That would make
her more powerful than Daniel.

419
00:20:44,128 --> 00:20:46,443
Oh, god forbid.

420
00:20:46,697 --> 00:20:49,482
Right. Well,
there's not much left,

421
00:20:49,496 --> 00:20:52,842
but I did manage to save
one or two goodies.

422
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:58,310
And you don't need to be a
size 6 to carry a nice bag.

423
00:20:58,537 --> 00:21:00,521
It's the Gucci bag.

424
00:21:00,877 --> 00:21:04,163
Wow, that's beautiful.
It matches your dress.

425
00:21:04,176 --> 00:21:06,021
It's not for me, Betty.

426
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:08,890
- It's for you.
- No, no, no, no.

427
00:21:08,907 --> 00:21:12,131
No, no, no. It's your first swag,
so you get the first pick,

428
00:21:12,148 --> 00:21:15,792
and believe me,
you really do need a new purse. Go on.

429
00:21:20,096 --> 00:21:22,940
Do you know? I believe that
fashion is good for the soul,

430
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,603
for just how it makes you feel.

431
00:21:27,626 --> 00:21:31,141
And you'll be amazed at the respect a
designer label brings you around here.

432
00:21:35,355 --> 00:21:38,210
Well, it's the nicest
thing I've ever owned.

433
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,961
Thank you.

434
00:21:39,976 --> 00:21:43,091
Just don't put your
crayons in it, okay?

435
00:21:47,095 --> 00:21:48,523
A watch?

436
00:21:48,715 --> 00:21:50,801
Christina said it's not
really that expensive,

437
00:21:50,815 --> 00:21:53,810
but they did use it in a
James Bond photo shoot.

438
00:21:53,826 --> 00:21:57,643
Suarez... Ignacio Suarez.

439
00:21:57,658 --> 00:22:00,673
- Hilda...
- Ooh, what is it?

440
00:22:01,147 --> 00:22:05,491
It's a scarf!
Oh, it's beautiful!

441
00:22:05,508 --> 00:22:07,003
It's Hermès!

442
00:22:07,015 --> 00:22:08,910
Yeah, I know that.

443
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:10,550
And, Justin....

444
00:22:10,568 --> 00:22:14,363
Oh, my god.
It's a Burberry belt.

445
00:22:15,016 --> 00:22:17,031
Thank you, thank you,
thank you!

446
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:18,540
I've gotta call all my friends.

447
00:22:18,557 --> 00:22:21,781
No, no, you don't! Justin!

448
00:22:24,317 --> 00:22:26,522
That reminds me of
your mother's handbag,

449
00:22:26,815 --> 00:22:28,763
the one she gave
to you, remember?

450
00:22:28,778 --> 00:22:30,723
You used to carry
it everywhere.

451
00:22:30,736 --> 00:22:32,573
It was almost as
big as you were.

452
00:22:32,586 --> 00:22:34,351
I remember.

453
00:22:34,985 --> 00:22:37,871
Man, how she loved that bag,

454
00:22:38,746 --> 00:22:41,122
said it made her
feel beautiful.

455
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:46,061
Oh, dad,
I went to the pharmacy this morning,

456
00:22:46,077 --> 00:22:48,491
and Maria wouldn't do it.

457
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,701
How much was the prescription?

458
00:22:50,718 --> 00:22:52,740
Almost $200.

459
00:22:54,626 --> 00:22:58,490
Well, that is a
beautiful bag...

460
00:22:58,966 --> 00:23:00,642
and this...

461
00:23:01,395 --> 00:23:03,482
this is a wonderful watch.

462
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,923
- Nice bag.
- Thank you.

463
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,752
- Can I touch it?
- Yeah.

464
00:24:04,926 --> 00:24:06,373
My bag.

465
00:24:06,865 --> 00:24:09,472
- She's got my bag.
- I found it.

466
00:24:10,466 --> 00:24:14,093
- You were hiding it for her.
- Oh, don't be a spoilsport.

467
00:24:14,108 --> 00:24:16,600
- She doesn't deserve a Gucci bag.
- Oh, and you do?

468
00:24:16,645 --> 00:24:18,121
She won't know what
to do with it.

469
00:24:18,136 --> 00:24:20,443
Look, it's touching polyester.

470
00:24:20,455 --> 00:24:22,851
I think she's wearing it
rather nicely, actually.

471
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:26,723
Oops.

472
00:24:26,737 --> 00:24:30,373
Yes, I'm trying to apply for a new
platinum card. There seems to be a problem.

473
00:24:30,696 --> 00:24:32,491
Daniel Meade.

474
00:24:32,508 --> 00:24:35,450
Yes, that's right.
"Mode" magazine. Mm-hmm.

475
00:24:36,856 --> 00:24:38,013
I see.

476
00:24:38,027 --> 00:24:40,211
Uh, well,
how about a gold card, then?

477
00:24:41,295 --> 00:24:42,720
Silver?

478
00:24:43,866 --> 00:24:47,083
Come on. I'm running out of colors here.
Can you help me out?

479
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:49,332
You know,
that's entirely uncalled--

480
00:24:50,137 --> 00:24:54,920
Apparently, my credit rating's lower
than that of most convicted felons.

481
00:24:54,937 --> 00:24:57,242
Nice bag. Vuitton?

482
00:24:57,256 --> 00:24:59,301
Gucci, from the closet...

483
00:24:59,316 --> 00:25:03,691
and inside, my list of 300 very
fun things to do in New York City

484
00:25:03,706 --> 00:25:06,882
for under $300,
and I think it's very good.

485
00:25:06,895 --> 00:25:09,831
He's here!
He's here, he's here!

486
00:25:09,847 --> 00:25:11,953
Oshi's on his way up!

487
00:25:12,517 --> 00:25:14,183
He's here.

488
00:25:18,075 --> 00:25:22,861
The master of minimal,
the king of clean...

489
00:25:23,015 --> 00:25:26,383
Marc... the champagne.

490
00:25:29,466 --> 00:25:31,723
Ohayo gozaimasu, Oshi-san.

491
00:25:33,218 --> 00:25:37,821
Good morning.
I'm very thirsty. Are you?

492
00:25:42,447 --> 00:25:44,461
We have fresh coffee.

493
00:25:47,097 --> 00:25:50,772
I am very thirsty for some champagne,
Oshi, are you?

494
00:25:50,787 --> 00:25:52,202
Wilhelmina.

495
00:25:55,196 --> 00:25:56,921
- Champagne.
- Kampai, darling.

496
00:25:56,937 --> 00:25:58,693
- Kampai.
- Kampai.

497
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,573
Daniel Meade...

498
00:26:03,585 --> 00:26:06,502
I will be fitting my spring
collection on my Models

499
00:26:06,515 --> 00:26:08,441
today and tomorrow.

500
00:26:08,675 --> 00:26:11,182
Tomorrow evening I will
return to do a showing

501
00:26:11,197 --> 00:26:13,132
for you and your editors.

502
00:26:13,975 --> 00:26:17,742
We will use your tube
entry for our runway walk.

503
00:26:18,475 --> 00:26:20,361
I like it...

504
00:26:20,376 --> 00:26:24,113
round, white, minimal.

505
00:26:25,825 --> 00:26:27,823
Then we will drink champagne,

506
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:31,152
and you will take us out
for a wonderful meal.

507
00:26:31,566 --> 00:26:35,110
After that,
we will talk business...

508
00:26:35,305 --> 00:26:36,962
or not.

509
00:26:43,377 --> 00:26:47,371
He said "a wonderful meal." He's
expecting a wonderful meal.

510
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:51,180
Well, I'd be happy to
pick up the tab, Daniel.

511
00:26:51,197 --> 00:26:52,683
I can treat.

512
00:26:52,697 --> 00:26:56,910
Of course, then you'd have
to invite me to the dinner.

513
00:27:00,427 --> 00:27:01,970
She knows I'm broke.

514
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:04,901
She knew before she
met with my father.

515
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:08,412
Daniel, I don't think it's really a good
idea to let Wilhelmina pay for dinner.

516
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:11,260
I mean, the japanese are very attuned
to nuance, and it would appear

517
00:27:11,277 --> 00:27:12,473
that you're not in charge.

518
00:27:12,488 --> 00:27:14,832
Oh, right, I-I get it, okay?

519
00:27:14,848 --> 00:27:17,041
But I don't have
a choice, right?

520
00:27:17,056 --> 00:27:19,380
I mean,
if I use Wilhelmina's expense account,

521
00:27:19,396 --> 00:27:22,202
she gets credit for keeping Oshi,
and my father knows I'm broke,

522
00:27:22,216 --> 00:27:24,872
but if I don't use her,
we risk losing Oshi,

523
00:27:24,887 --> 00:27:26,923
and he really knows I'm broke.

524
00:27:26,935 --> 00:27:29,470
Either way, I end up looking
like a financial incompetent,

525
00:27:29,487 --> 00:27:31,072
and she gets the
publisher's job.

526
00:27:31,085 --> 00:27:34,220
Well, not if you can
impress Oshi under $300,

527
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:36,183
and there are some really
great things on this list.

528
00:27:36,218 --> 00:27:38,793
$300 won't buy Oshi
a new scrunchie.

529
00:27:38,805 --> 00:27:41,051
We could take him
to the movies...

530
00:27:41,067 --> 00:27:44,460
or, um, okay, uh,
the Statue of Liberty...

531
00:27:44,475 --> 00:27:46,812
or you know what?
Walter and I had so much fun

532
00:27:46,828 --> 00:27:50,933
eating at Papaya Queen and riding
the Staten Island ferry, really.

533
00:27:51,248 --> 00:27:54,040
The ferry, Betty? Really?

534
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:55,320
Yeah.

535
00:27:57,065 --> 00:27:59,770
Yeah. Oh, let's forget it.

536
00:27:59,788 --> 00:28:02,450
Wilhelmina got us.
This is over.

537
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:04,033
We're done.

538
00:28:04,707 --> 00:28:07,513
Well, it's his own fault
for spending so much.

539
00:28:07,527 --> 00:28:09,882
Yeah, but I filled out
his expense report.

540
00:28:09,895 --> 00:28:12,011
No, no, no, no, no,
you just didn't lie for him.

541
00:28:12,026 --> 00:28:14,202
Listen, they're all at it.
They all cheat.

542
00:28:14,215 --> 00:28:16,952
Wilhelmina, especially.
They abuse their expense accounts

543
00:28:16,967 --> 00:28:19,722
like it's their god-given right,
and they pay us slave wages.

544
00:28:19,738 --> 00:28:22,681
- Nice Gucci.
- Thank you.

545
00:28:23,747 --> 00:28:26,340
Oh, it's the last salad.

546
00:28:26,358 --> 00:28:27,872
That's okay.

547
00:28:28,928 --> 00:28:31,093
We carb-loading for a marathon?

548
00:28:31,107 --> 00:28:33,293
We can't all live on laxatives.

549
00:28:36,496 --> 00:28:38,063
Hey, Betty.

550
00:28:38,075 --> 00:28:39,463
Seamstress.

551
00:28:39,476 --> 00:28:42,093
See, the girl from styles
who got my Louboutin boots--

552
00:28:42,105 --> 00:28:43,693
she would die to
have your Gucci bag.

553
00:28:43,708 --> 00:28:46,752
So here's the deal--I will trade
you my season tickets to the opera

554
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:49,402
for your bag.
Then I can trade your bag for my boots,

555
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:51,020
and everyone winds up a winner.

556
00:28:51,035 --> 00:28:53,191
The opera? She lives in Queens.

557
00:28:53,205 --> 00:28:56,913
If she wants to hear fat italians
screaming, she can open her window.

558
00:28:56,928 --> 00:28:58,593
Betty loves her new bag.
Don't you?

559
00:28:58,605 --> 00:29:00,621
- Yes, I do.
- There you go, then.

560
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:02,843
Go away and throw up your
celery sticks. Shoo!

561
00:29:03,605 --> 00:29:05,112
Opera tickets?

562
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:08,351
Christina, how much
exactly is this bag worth?

563
00:29:08,367 --> 00:29:11,001
Retail? About $4,500.

564
00:29:11,018 --> 00:29:14,622
With the pickle,
however, $4,200.

565
00:29:29,795 --> 00:29:32,160
Please just go home, Walter.

566
00:29:32,355 --> 00:29:33,940
Leave me alone.

567
00:29:56,165 --> 00:29:57,292
I'm home.

568
00:29:57,308 --> 00:30:00,303
We didn't want to start without you,
but it was getting cold.

569
00:30:00,726 --> 00:30:02,331
I went to see Maria.

570
00:30:02,437 --> 00:30:04,363
She gave you 15 refills.

571
00:30:04,377 --> 00:30:07,943
15? You wanna tell me how you
got her to give you 15 refills?

572
00:30:07,957 --> 00:30:09,471
Where's your Gucci?

573
00:30:16,046 --> 00:30:17,922
- Betty...
- It's okay.

574
00:30:17,935 --> 00:30:20,083
It was swag, part of my wages.

575
00:30:20,098 --> 00:30:23,832
That witch blows 25 grand in Rio,
and you've gotta give up your purse--

576
00:30:23,845 --> 00:30:26,383
- Hilda, it's okay.
- No, it's not okay, Betty.

577
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:27,933
Well, that's the way it is.

578
00:30:32,566 --> 00:30:33,723
I got it.

579
00:30:42,545 --> 00:30:43,592
Hey.

580
00:30:46,357 --> 00:30:50,032
Do you remember how angry you were
when mom gave me her good purse?

581
00:30:50,508 --> 00:30:53,262
Yeah, well... you were 3,

582
00:30:53,887 --> 00:30:57,272
and you used it to carry
around your crayons.

583
00:30:57,988 --> 00:31:01,372
I finally figured out why she
gave it to me and not to you.

584
00:31:01,387 --> 00:31:03,001
Díga me.

585
00:31:03,817 --> 00:31:06,430
She knew how it
would make me feel.

586
00:31:10,467 --> 00:31:13,941
Christina says that fashion
is good for the soul...

587
00:31:15,357 --> 00:31:18,603
and when I was walking
around with my Gucci today,

588
00:31:19,686 --> 00:31:23,743
it was like I was 3 years old
again and holding mom's purse...

589
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:28,413
and I actually felt pretty.

590
00:31:31,326 --> 00:31:32,990
I know, mama.

591
00:31:43,426 --> 00:31:47,290
Well, you had to do it, Betty.
No matter how much you loved the bag,

592
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:49,710
- you did the right thing.
- I know.

593
00:31:49,726 --> 00:31:52,283
So then you went and got
a bag from the corner guy?

594
00:31:52,297 --> 00:31:55,353
Are you kidding me?
No, that thing costs, like, $200.

595
00:31:55,367 --> 00:31:58,110
I just kept thinking about what
Hilda said, about how unfair it was

596
00:31:58,126 --> 00:32:01,652
that Wilhelmina goes to Rio to
spend $25,000 on props and extras.

597
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:03,530
We couldn't even afford
medicine for my dad.

598
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:08,471
Totally, and you have no idea
how they pad their expenses.

599
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:13,833
Don't stop on my account.

600
00:32:14,227 --> 00:32:16,183
Well, that's exactly
what I was thinking.

601
00:32:16,196 --> 00:32:19,913
So I told Justin to bring me his
issue with the Rio spread, and he did.

602
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:23,150
Hello. Where's the Gucci?

603
00:32:23,165 --> 00:32:25,400
I didn't want to get
another pickle on it.

604
00:32:25,655 --> 00:32:28,852
Okay, so I realize the opera
tickets were totally inappropriate.

605
00:32:28,868 --> 00:32:32,480
Here is a menudo box set and
a coupon for 100 taquitos.

606
00:32:33,065 --> 00:32:34,373
What?

607
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:41,021
- I don't have much time.
- That makes two of us.

608
00:32:41,035 --> 00:32:43,600
I need to see Wilhelmina's expense
report from the last issue--

609
00:32:43,615 --> 00:32:44,530
the real one.

610
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:45,971
That's against company policy.

611
00:32:45,988 --> 00:32:47,473
Coffee and a bagel?

612
00:32:47,487 --> 00:32:49,451
Mmm... need a real reason.

613
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:53,011
There was a $25,000 charge
made to the Casa Brazil

614
00:32:53,026 --> 00:32:55,271
- under "props and extras."
- And?

615
00:32:55,328 --> 00:32:57,583
Show me the props and extras.

616
00:32:57,596 --> 00:33:01,052
Models on a beach wearing bikinis--sand,
water, boobs.

617
00:33:01,068 --> 00:33:02,982
This could've been shot
for next to nothing.

618
00:33:02,997 --> 00:33:05,802
Okay, so maybe she was padding.
Everybody pads a little.

619
00:33:05,815 --> 00:33:08,581
A little? Daniel, $25,000?

620
00:33:08,596 --> 00:33:10,802
That's my family's
rent for a year.

621
00:33:10,818 --> 00:33:14,612
Betty, I can't question the creative
director of a major fashion magazine.

622
00:33:14,627 --> 00:33:17,621
Who's hiding a huge expense
under "props and extras."

623
00:33:17,635 --> 00:33:20,351
It's not right, and it's not
right when you do it, either.

624
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:24,151
Point taken, but Oshi's due in two
hours. If we take Wilhelmina down--

625
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:26,713
Then they cancel her company credit
card. She can't pay for Oshi,

626
00:33:26,746 --> 00:33:28,761
and your father will
never make her publisher.

627
00:33:28,778 --> 00:33:33,561
And I'm left with $327 to entertain
Oshi and his entire entourage.

628
00:33:33,627 --> 00:33:35,922
Then ditch the entourage.
Only take him to dinner,

629
00:33:35,936 --> 00:33:39,300
and don't tell me that
$327 isn't enough.

630
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:40,660
Okay.

631
00:33:40,675 --> 00:33:44,372
All right, and how do we
prove Wilhelmina cheated? Hmm?

632
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,183
Am I invited to
the dinner, Daniel?

633
00:34:19,198 --> 00:34:21,902
I don't think Masa
allows dishwashing

634
00:34:21,917 --> 00:34:23,703
as a form of payment.

635
00:34:23,968 --> 00:34:27,992
Actually, Wilhelmina, I was thinking
of something a bit more private.

636
00:34:28,008 --> 00:34:29,310
Were you?

637
00:34:29,325 --> 00:34:30,842
Oshi-san...

638
00:34:30,858 --> 00:34:34,900
in the spirit of minimalism,
and to honor your collection,

639
00:34:34,915 --> 00:34:37,860
uh, I was thinking we might
have our dinner one-on-one.

640
00:34:37,878 --> 00:34:41,850
You and me, alone,
so we can get to know each other.

641
00:34:43,968 --> 00:34:45,293
Alone?

642
00:34:46,426 --> 00:34:48,793
No. No, no.

643
00:34:48,806 --> 00:34:51,131
Oshi is...

644
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:53,762
Oshi.

645
00:35:10,495 --> 00:35:12,503
I'm sorry.
There wasn't another way in.

646
00:35:12,515 --> 00:35:14,650
- Where's Henry?
- Meeting with your father.

647
00:35:14,665 --> 00:35:16,170
Is there any way
to hold them off?

648
00:35:16,188 --> 00:35:17,102
Why?

649
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,572
Because Oshi is Oshi,

650
00:35:19,586 --> 00:35:22,193
and we have $300
to feed 15 people.

651
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:25,430
I mean, if we want him to stay at "Mode,"
we have to invite Wilhelmina along.

652
00:35:25,445 --> 00:35:28,933
No. No, no, then you lose, Daniel.
You can't just give up without a fight.

653
00:35:28,945 --> 00:35:32,000
Yeah, but we don't have a plan
"b," Betty. I don't have a choice.

654
00:35:34,808 --> 00:35:37,323
It's so minimal, it's nothing.

655
00:35:37,338 --> 00:35:39,290
Yes, yes.

656
00:35:39,307 --> 00:35:41,893
Simple is better.

657
00:35:42,085 --> 00:35:46,682
Round... white... minimal.

658
00:35:47,238 --> 00:35:49,670
Round, white...

659
00:35:49,685 --> 00:35:52,803
- Minimal. Kampai, Oshi.
- Kampai.

660
00:35:52,815 --> 00:35:55,442
Brilliant collection--brilliant
in its simplicity.

661
00:35:55,456 --> 00:35:58,823
- It's minimal, it's white--
- It's crazy. You can't be serious.

662
00:35:58,835 --> 00:36:01,291
It might work, Daniel,
and we have to try something.

663
00:36:01,308 --> 00:36:03,633
No, we don't, Betty. It's over.

664
00:36:03,645 --> 00:36:07,951
Party time, Daniel.
Oshi's ready for more champagne.

665
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:11,101
Uh, well, we could drink more
champagne at Masa, Oshi.

666
00:36:11,116 --> 00:36:13,463
Isn't that right, Wilhelmina?

667
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:18,013
I would love to come.

668
00:36:18,025 --> 00:36:20,601
I'm famished, Oshi, aren't you?

669
00:36:20,615 --> 00:36:24,242
Oshi's hungry, okay?
Very hungry.

670
00:36:26,175 --> 00:36:29,290
But he and your father will
know who paid the bill.

671
00:36:30,128 --> 00:36:32,290
Shall we move on to dinner?

672
00:36:32,306 --> 00:36:35,632
Actually, Wilhelmina,
I think you have more pressing business.

673
00:36:35,647 --> 00:36:37,790
May we see you for a moment?

674
00:36:38,627 --> 00:36:39,842
Bradford?

675
00:36:39,855 --> 00:36:43,603
It's about the last
issue's shoot in Rio.

676
00:36:44,095 --> 00:36:46,480
Uh... was there a problem?

677
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:48,792
I don't mind paying
for props and extras,

678
00:36:48,805 --> 00:36:53,310
but I take great exception at
financing your brazilian butt lift.

679
00:36:57,697 --> 00:37:02,503
I'm sure you'll all have a
wonderful dinner without me.

680
00:37:12,418 --> 00:37:14,501
Stop looking at it.

681
00:37:15,895 --> 00:37:18,471
It may as well be Oshi
walking out the door.

682
00:37:18,485 --> 00:37:20,843
We have a plan "b," Daniel.

683
00:37:20,858 --> 00:37:22,661
You think so, Betty?

684
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:24,412
I think we're screwed.

685
00:37:32,176 --> 00:37:33,682
This better work, Betty.

686
00:37:33,698 --> 00:37:37,260
He likes round, he likes white,
he likes minimal. It's perfect.

687
00:37:37,277 --> 00:37:38,371
Daniel?

688
00:37:38,848 --> 00:37:40,612
Taking him somewhere special?

689
00:37:40,627 --> 00:37:42,303
Someplace unique.

690
00:37:42,315 --> 00:37:44,282
Just remember you're
on your own dime.

691
00:37:44,298 --> 00:37:45,611
Kinda hard to forget, dad.

692
00:37:45,627 --> 00:37:46,881
Make sure you don't lose him.

693
00:37:46,896 --> 00:37:47,830
He won't.

694
00:37:50,048 --> 00:37:52,852
Good luck returning my ass!

695
00:37:58,308 --> 00:38:01,830
Oshi want to know
where we are going.

696
00:38:02,706 --> 00:38:05,671
- New Jersey.
- New Jersey?

697
00:38:16,217 --> 00:38:18,241
Holy crap.

698
00:38:18,366 --> 00:38:20,410
This is a disaster.

699
00:38:20,426 --> 00:38:22,050
I can feel it.

700
00:38:23,986 --> 00:38:25,501
Daniel!

701
00:38:25,766 --> 00:38:27,600
Yes, Oshi?

702
00:38:27,618 --> 00:38:29,821
What place is this?

703
00:38:29,835 --> 00:38:31,802
Where have you brought me?

704
00:38:32,415 --> 00:38:34,231
It's called...

705
00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:37,281
the White Tassel.

706
00:38:38,306 --> 00:38:43,750
It's clean, white, minimal.

707
00:38:44,527 --> 00:38:47,370
Round food inside.

708
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:52,882
Minimal.

709
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:54,911
He likes it.

710
00:38:54,927 --> 00:38:57,301
Oshi likes it.

711
00:39:04,445 --> 00:39:07,600
We've got exclusives for
his next four collections.

712
00:39:07,615 --> 00:39:09,660
"Minimal, Daniel."

713
00:39:09,676 --> 00:39:11,092
Yeah.

714
00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:15,022
Yeah. Thanks, dad.

715
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:19,250
No, you have no idea how
much I appreciate that.

716
00:39:19,266 --> 00:39:21,651
Okay, yeah.

717
00:39:21,906 --> 00:39:24,272
He's reactivating my
company credit card.

718
00:39:24,288 --> 00:39:25,780
Yes!

719
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:28,093
He's tough, but he's fair.

720
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:31,021
And thanks for the lesson.

721
00:39:31,846 --> 00:39:34,581
It's not how much you have.
It's how you spend it.

722
00:39:34,595 --> 00:39:38,892
Yeah, I was thinking more like
the one about not giving up.

723
00:39:39,798 --> 00:39:41,873
Forget about it.

724
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:49,093
Good night, Betty.

725
00:39:49,108 --> 00:39:50,583
Good night.

726
00:39:52,986 --> 00:39:54,492
Betty.

727
00:40:00,336 --> 00:40:03,253
I know. "Walter, go away."

728
00:40:04,456 --> 00:40:06,490
It's just a knockoff.

729
00:40:13,028 --> 00:40:14,692
It's wonderful.

730
00:40:35,508 --> 00:40:37,071
Nice bag.

731
00:40:38,865 --> 00:40:40,762
It truly is.

732
00:40:41,516 --> 00:40:44,340
Okay, forget the opera tickets.
Forget the taquitos.

733
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,490
Final offer--body
wax at natrique

734
00:40:46,507 --> 00:40:48,763
and a weekend at my parents'
house in the Hamptons.

735
00:40:48,777 --> 00:40:50,290
No sale.

736
00:40:50,308 --> 00:40:54,481
Full body wax.
That includes the back!

737
00:40:56,406 --> 00:40:59,321
Okay, it's yours...

738
00:40:59,335 --> 00:41:02,052
for one of the fake Guccis the
guy's selling around the corner,

739
00:41:02,066 --> 00:41:05,150
and a huge favor to be
named a later date.

740
00:41:05,306 --> 00:41:07,581
You won't fool
anyone with a phony.

741
00:41:07,596 --> 00:41:09,930
- I'll take my chances.
- Seriously?

742
00:41:09,948 --> 00:41:12,940
I think I'm beginning to learn
the way it works around here.

743
00:41:14,107 --> 00:41:16,301
Then... deal.

744
00:41:22,518 --> 00:41:26,763
So he took Walter's phony
and bought you a new phony.

745
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,911
And still owes me a huge favor.

746
00:41:28,927 --> 00:41:30,502
Well, what happens
when he finds out?

747
00:41:30,515 --> 00:41:31,921
Ah, well, you see,
that is the genius.

748
00:41:31,955 --> 00:41:35,491
Because Marc would never admit
to being duped-- not by Betty.

749
00:41:35,507 --> 00:41:37,020
Exactly.

750
00:41:37,427 --> 00:41:40,662
Well, that's it.

751
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,612
I've only been
here a short time,

752
00:41:43,627 --> 00:41:46,182
but I feel like I made
some good friends,

753
00:41:46,195 --> 00:41:47,870
and I learned a lot.

754
00:41:47,888 --> 00:41:49,981
Hey, this is just
the beginning.

755
00:41:49,997 --> 00:41:54,150
I know.
I just wish it didn't feel like the end.

756
00:41:56,637 --> 00:41:58,182
See ya.

757
00:42:03,157 --> 00:42:05,342
I'm really gonna miss her,
you know?

758
