1
00:00:00,454 --> 00:00:01,931
Previously on "Ugly Betty"...

2
00:00:02,031 --> 00:00:03,877
Bradford is into feet?

3
00:00:03,977 --> 00:00:06,631
Bradford Meade won't be able
to keep his hands off you.

4
00:00:06,731 --> 00:00:08,590
In six months you'll be
running Meade publications.

5
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,570
That's the idea.

6
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,934
What we have is... wonderful,

7
00:00:12,034 --> 00:00:13,775
but I'm never gonna
divorce Claire.

8
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:15,507
Do you need a condom?
I've got one in my wallet.

9
00:00:15,537 --> 00:00:18,459
You get her out of the country, and
you'll have everything you ever wanted.

10
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:19,430
She's already hooked.

11
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:22,578
You sleep with women to distract yourself
from what's going on in your life.

12
00:00:22,615 --> 00:00:24,144
You're using them like a drug.

13
00:00:24,242 --> 00:00:25,332
I missed you.

14
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:27,511
I missed you, too.

15
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,703
They're sending me
back to Mexico.

16
00:00:34,278 --> 00:00:37,011
$1,200 for a ticket
to Guadalajara?!

17
00:00:37,316 --> 00:00:38,590
That's ridiculous!

18
00:00:39,955 --> 00:00:41,093
What, are they kidding?

19
00:00:41,196 --> 00:00:42,613
We cannot afford that!

20
00:00:42,717 --> 00:00:44,262
Hilda, I got it.

21
00:00:44,368 --> 00:00:47,270
No, I don't want a
package deal to Acapulco.

22
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:50,622
My father is being sent back to
Mexico to wait for his visa,

23
00:00:50,725 --> 00:00:53,791
and then he'll--
Yes, I'll hold.

24
00:00:53,995 --> 00:00:56,370
Suarez, are you still
working on those nails?

25
00:00:56,478 --> 00:00:58,713
You do know the final
exam is timed, right?

26
00:00:58,817 --> 00:01:02,062
Look, Valerie, I'm going through
problems with my family right now.

27
00:01:02,168 --> 00:01:03,563
- Our fa--
- Oh, no. No.

28
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:05,261
I don't want your
excuses, Suarez.

29
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:07,932
I want your
commitment to beauty.

30
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:10,600
What does this look like?

31
00:01:10,707 --> 00:01:12,852
Oh, my god,
is that an engagement ring?

32
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:15,182
Yeah. My ex and I
started dating again--

33
00:01:15,287 --> 00:01:19,001
Lose it. And you cannot do a professional
manicure with claws like those.

34
00:01:19,106 --> 00:01:21,832
Cut 'em before the exam tomorrow,
or I fail you.

35
00:01:25,305 --> 00:01:27,022
She seems very helpful.

36
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:29,580
She's 130 pounds of bitch.

37
00:01:29,687 --> 00:01:31,160
What did you say?

38
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:32,971
120.

39
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:37,601
Listen, why don't we take care
of this ticket thing tonight?

40
00:01:37,707 --> 00:01:41,393
I'll cancel with Santos, and we can call
every travel agency in Jackson Heights.

41
00:01:41,497 --> 00:01:43,632
I have this thing I have
to go to after work.

42
00:01:45,597 --> 00:01:46,602
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

43
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:50,163
It's the "Mode" party for
Administrative Professionals Day.

44
00:01:50,665 --> 00:01:52,071
You mean Secretaries Day?

45
00:01:52,177 --> 00:01:56,272
No. In 1998, they changed it to
Administrative Professionals Day.

46
00:01:56,377 --> 00:01:58,403
Oh, that really
rolls off the tongue.

47
00:01:58,595 --> 00:02:00,321
So where you guys gonna go?

48
00:02:00,428 --> 00:02:02,662
You know that theme
restaurant in Times Square--

49
00:02:02,767 --> 00:02:03,681
the Middle Ages?

50
00:02:03,787 --> 00:02:06,920
You mean those snobby assistants from
"Mode" actually like that kind of place?

51
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:09,810
Oh, they love it. Every year they
pick a place where they can go

52
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:11,352
and make fun of "the
common people."

53
00:02:11,448 --> 00:02:13,711
Last year it was that
roller disco in the Bronx.

54
00:02:13,817 --> 00:02:15,462
"Wheels of Paradise"?
I love that place.

55
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:16,313
I know!

56
00:02:16,418 --> 00:02:18,173
Anyway, I'm the
one who planned it,

57
00:02:18,275 --> 00:02:19,462
so I have to be there

58
00:02:19,566 --> 00:02:21,202
just to make sure
everything goes okay.

59
00:02:21,305 --> 00:02:22,883
Well, you know,
it is Secretaries Day.

60
00:02:22,988 --> 00:02:24,630
Maybe Daniel will
give you a big bonus,

61
00:02:24,737 --> 00:02:26,953
and we can use it to
buy papi's ticket.

62
00:02:27,528 --> 00:02:29,492
Happy Secretaries Day.

63
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:37,143
"World's best... notary"?

64
00:02:37,248 --> 00:02:39,281
I, uh, got to the store
a little late.

65
00:02:39,386 --> 00:02:42,111
Well, it's the thought
that counts, right?

66
00:02:42,616 --> 00:02:46,503
But you do know that they changed it to
Administrative Professionals Day in 1998?

67
00:02:46,608 --> 00:02:47,441
Right.

68
00:02:47,545 --> 00:02:49,692
Uh, can you get me
Olivier Theyskens?

69
00:02:49,798 --> 00:02:51,840
He promised us a
Nina Ricci spread.

70
00:02:51,947 --> 00:02:54,101
And send over some
hot girls for that.

71
00:02:54,206 --> 00:02:56,801
I'm in the mood for redheads.

72
00:02:56,946 --> 00:02:58,720
Um, this is work-related?

73
00:02:58,825 --> 00:03:00,081
Oh, we'll see.

74
00:03:06,338 --> 00:03:07,430
What's that?

75
00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:09,071
Yogurt.

76
00:03:09,178 --> 00:03:10,091
My yogurt?

77
00:03:10,196 --> 00:03:11,313
It didn't have a name on it.

78
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:13,672
No, but my name was on the
granola that was on top of it.

79
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:16,241
Don't you know the
refrigerator stacking system?

80
00:03:16,347 --> 00:03:19,010
So does that mean that the
cherry pie was yours, too?

81
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:20,070
You ate my pie?

82
00:03:20,175 --> 00:03:21,613
Well, not yet.

83
00:03:23,846 --> 00:03:26,661
Game on, Suarez, game on.

84
00:03:28,405 --> 00:03:31,430
God, I hate Secretaries Day.

85
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:33,992
You hide it so well.

86
00:03:34,098 --> 00:03:36,242
Everyone gets a present
but the receptionist.

87
00:03:36,347 --> 00:03:38,120
I might as well be invisible.

88
00:03:38,225 --> 00:03:40,800
I mean,
who do they think forwards the calls?

89
00:03:41,787 --> 00:03:43,840
Who fans the magazines?

90
00:03:44,956 --> 00:03:46,743
Who signs for packages?

91
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:49,293
Tim, Sheila and Betty.

92
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:54,110
Well, who looks hot for
everyone when they come in?

93
00:03:54,216 --> 00:03:56,562
I mean, these buttons don't
just pop open by themselves.

94
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:57,661
Where'd you get that vest?

95
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,603
This? It's Tavares'.

96
00:03:59,705 --> 00:04:01,672
That cutie designer
made you another one?

97
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:04,271
What's with all the gifties?
It not like you're sleeping with him.

98
00:04:04,305 --> 00:04:06,672
Of course not, 'cause he's gay,
and I'm a woman, and he's gay.

99
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:07,891
Oh, yeah!

100
00:04:09,017 --> 00:04:11,321
Hey, what's fratty
so happy about?

101
00:04:11,427 --> 00:04:13,700
What, did his sports team win
the beef bowl or something?

102
00:04:13,768 --> 00:04:16,000
Close. Alexis signed him up
for a beer-of-the-month club

103
00:04:16,075 --> 00:04:18,861
for secre--tariat's birthday.

104
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:20,130
He loves horseys.

105
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,413
Who knew?

106
00:04:22,335 --> 00:04:24,440
I am now officially miserable.

107
00:04:24,546 --> 00:04:27,313
Oh! Wait till we get to that
Middle Ages place tonight

108
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:29,301
and make fun of all the
nerds in shining armor.

109
00:04:29,408 --> 00:04:32,023
It'll be the mocking
event of the season.

110
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,870
- I think I'm gonna pass.
- What?

111
00:04:33,977 --> 00:04:36,430
You can't pass.
I'm not going stag, hag.

112
00:04:36,537 --> 00:04:38,240
You'll have to buy
your own beer, queer.

113
00:04:38,348 --> 00:04:40,483
- You can't just ditch, bi--
- Shut up!

114
00:04:50,426 --> 00:04:52,543
Okay, tried it. Still hate it.

115
00:04:52,648 --> 00:04:54,862
You are so white sometimes.

116
00:04:54,966 --> 00:04:56,793
I'm white and I'm bored.

117
00:04:57,147 --> 00:04:59,331
You know why you
don't like jazz?

118
00:04:59,976 --> 00:05:04,830
Because it's about riffing
and being spontaneous.

119
00:05:05,776 --> 00:05:08,882
You would love jazz
if you saw it live.

120
00:05:09,056 --> 00:05:11,653
I am gonna take you to
the Blue Note tonight.

121
00:05:11,805 --> 00:05:14,602
Oh, Willie,
can we hold off on that?

122
00:05:14,707 --> 00:05:16,061
Why?

123
00:05:16,256 --> 00:05:18,073
All we do is stay in.

124
00:05:18,177 --> 00:05:20,523
It's just that with
Claire in prison,

125
00:05:20,627 --> 00:05:22,861
this is the last thing
she needs to hear about.

126
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:25,473
Don't you think it's time
you move on with your life,

127
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,121
our lives?

128
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:30,711
You really care what
a murderer thinks?

129
00:05:30,816 --> 00:05:33,672
She is not a murderer,
and I will not leave her

130
00:05:33,776 --> 00:05:36,453
just because of one
moment of insanity.

131
00:05:41,105 --> 00:05:42,501
It would never work.

132
00:05:42,605 --> 00:05:46,452
Of course it would, so why wouldn't
you want to go to Brazil with me?

133
00:05:46,557 --> 00:05:51,502
Uh, for one, I've got sideburns and
a moustache in my passport photo.

134
00:05:52,516 --> 00:05:55,302
Come on, Rodrigo,
I can't do this right now.

135
00:05:55,585 --> 00:05:56,971
My mother's in prison.

136
00:05:57,075 --> 00:05:58,512
How can I just leave her?

137
00:05:58,615 --> 00:06:01,463
I would think your mother
would want you to be happy.

138
00:06:07,016 --> 00:06:08,191
So...

139
00:06:08,587 --> 00:06:11,581
should I get used to this
whole mug shot look?

140
00:06:11,687 --> 00:06:13,323
Oh, I was out late at the...

141
00:06:13,428 --> 00:06:16,050
therapy meeting you
signed me up for.

142
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:17,523
Who's Kristin?

143
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,850
Uh, met her at the meeting.

144
00:06:19,951 --> 00:06:23,628
"Soho Grand, room 709.
I'm going to..."

145
00:06:24,925 --> 00:06:26,624
Not gonna finish reading that.

146
00:06:26,722 --> 00:06:28,512
Okay, so maybe I didn't
go to a meeting.

147
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:30,402
Daniel, what are you doing?

148
00:06:30,508 --> 00:06:33,280
You have a problem.
You slept with an underaged model.

149
00:06:33,387 --> 00:06:35,632
Yeah, who turned out
not to be underage.

150
00:06:36,156 --> 00:06:38,641
Why are you
so "glass-half-empty"?

151
00:06:38,745 --> 00:06:42,591
No, no, no, no. The glass is crushed into
a million little pieces all over the floor,

152
00:06:42,696 --> 00:06:44,780
and I'm just waiting
for you to step on it.

153
00:06:44,888 --> 00:06:46,141
You got lucky.

154
00:06:46,248 --> 00:06:49,320
Next time, you won't.

155
00:06:51,928 --> 00:06:55,031
Do you think people will want the
royal feast or the jester's banquet?

156
00:06:55,137 --> 00:06:56,700
I think people just
want to get drunk.

157
00:06:56,808 --> 00:06:59,381
Look here. There.
This is a way you could make some money.

158
00:06:59,558 --> 00:07:02,261
N.Y.U. is looking for
some research subjects.

159
00:07:02,365 --> 00:07:04,653
- How much?
- $5,000!

160
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:08,303
Wait, all you have to do
is get injected with...

161
00:07:08,405 --> 00:07:09,980
Can't quite read that...

162
00:07:10,085 --> 00:07:12,473
Several syllables...
oh, and side effects.

163
00:07:12,578 --> 00:07:14,132
Yeah, let's keep
that as a backup.

164
00:07:14,238 --> 00:07:15,602
Aren't there any
part-time jobs?

165
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,532
- Got any welding experience?
- Oh, my god, yes!

166
00:07:18,636 --> 00:07:20,972
- You weld?
- No, Christina, look!

167
00:07:21,075 --> 00:07:24,783
I could get $1,000 for riding some
mechanical horse for just 15 seconds?

168
00:07:24,888 --> 00:07:26,310
I could totally do that!

169
00:07:26,415 --> 00:07:28,681
No, are you sure you wouldn't rather
just deal with the side effects?

170
00:07:28,718 --> 00:07:31,661
Listen, when I was a little girl,
I hated getting my allergy shots,

171
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:34,263
so I used to grab onto
this tree outside my house

172
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:37,281
and wrap my legs around so tight,
no one could pull me off.

173
00:07:37,388 --> 00:07:39,253
These are thighs of steel.

174
00:07:39,356 --> 00:07:43,340
Betty, I think there is a big difference
between a giant robot horse and a tree.

175
00:07:43,445 --> 00:07:46,280
I'm telling you,
I could do this.

176
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:53,061
If this is what it
takes to help my father,

177
00:07:53,165 --> 00:07:55,753
then I will ride that
giant robot horse

178
00:07:55,856 --> 00:07:57,551
all the way to Mexico!

182
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:15,370
I dare you not to
make fun of me.

183
00:08:20,037 --> 00:08:22,231
Okay, seriously,
ye olde bowl cut.

184
00:08:22,475 --> 00:08:24,580
- It's too easy.
- Exactly.

185
00:08:24,688 --> 00:08:26,830
Imagine 30 guys
dressed like me,

186
00:08:26,936 --> 00:08:30,432
serving tourists with
mullets and fanny packs.

187
00:08:30,537 --> 00:08:32,852
Middle Ages is gonna
be duh-licious.

188
00:08:32,956 --> 00:08:34,962
It's gonna be Britney shaving
her head all over again.

189
00:08:34,996 --> 00:08:36,690
Oh, that was fun.

190
00:08:36,795 --> 00:08:37,910
But then it got sad.

191
00:08:38,015 --> 00:08:39,501
No, but then it got fun again.

192
00:08:39,605 --> 00:08:41,982
What's your deal, anyway?
Why won't you come?

193
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:46,480
Okay, promise you won't
say anything to anyone?

194
00:08:46,588 --> 00:08:48,960
I swear on the abs
of Marc Wahlberg.

195
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:50,472
Wow, you are serious.

196
00:08:50,578 --> 00:08:53,760
Okay, remember how,
before I worked here,

197
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:55,620
I was an actress?

198
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:00,772
Shut the front door!

199
00:09:00,877 --> 00:09:02,681
Your acting reel?

200
00:09:02,787 --> 00:09:03,931
Bring it.

201
00:09:05,357 --> 00:09:06,512
Hi, grandma.

202
00:09:07,177 --> 00:09:08,811
- Hey, Betty.
- Henry.

203
00:09:08,918 --> 00:09:09,751
- Hey.
- Hi.

204
00:09:09,858 --> 00:09:12,502
I heard you were planning the
Administrative Professionals Day party,

205
00:09:12,537 --> 00:09:14,572
and well, I was kind of
wondering if I could crash.

206
00:09:14,648 --> 00:09:15,380
Really?

207
00:09:15,486 --> 00:09:18,652
Yeah, bit of a Dungeons
and Dragons geek.

208
00:09:18,998 --> 00:09:20,353
Big surprise, I know.

209
00:09:20,455 --> 00:09:24,822
I-I guess I have sort of a soft spot
for castles and chivalry and...

210
00:09:24,927 --> 00:09:26,130
princesses.

211
00:09:29,407 --> 00:09:33,702
Okay, well, um, I'll just put you and
Charlie on the scroll at the door.

212
00:09:33,805 --> 00:09:35,453
Oh, actually,
Charlie can't make it.

213
00:09:35,558 --> 00:09:37,673
She's been waiting for Blanket
Space to open up on Astor Place

214
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:38,600
to sell her jewelry.

215
00:09:38,706 --> 00:09:40,743
Anyway, yesterday one of the
guys got some bad chicken.

216
00:09:40,776 --> 00:09:43,690
So long story short,
now she has a prime spot.

217
00:09:43,795 --> 00:09:45,910
Well, that's great
for Charlie...

218
00:09:46,017 --> 00:09:48,612
and for salmonella...

219
00:09:48,717 --> 00:09:49,763
I guess.

220
00:09:49,868 --> 00:09:54,822
Okay, well, I shall see thee
in the Middle Ages, milady.

221
00:09:54,925 --> 00:09:56,291
You're such a dork.

222
00:09:56,397 --> 00:09:57,712
You know you love it.

223
00:10:06,408 --> 00:10:08,521
No one can ever
know of our love.

224
00:10:10,775 --> 00:10:13,043
Nurse, get out! Stat!

225
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:14,800
That's your cue, honey. Go.

226
00:10:16,726 --> 00:10:18,471
I'm a lonely kitten.

227
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,112
Call the chat line now.

228
00:10:20,217 --> 00:10:22,901
I'm waiting to purr for you.

229
00:10:32,995 --> 00:10:35,530
Greetings, lords and ladies,

230
00:10:35,637 --> 00:10:38,063
and welcome to the Middle Ages,

231
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:41,411
a magical journey through time.

232
00:10:41,518 --> 00:10:44,710
So partakest thou
of our humble fare,

233
00:10:44,817 --> 00:10:48,181
and quenchest thine
thirst at ye olde bar.

234
00:10:48,286 --> 00:10:50,681
Kids under 12 eat
free on sundays.

235
00:10:51,287 --> 00:10:56,151
Okay, that was hi--wait
for it--larious!

236
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,462
For you, maybe.

237
00:10:57,568 --> 00:11:00,511
They play this thing on
a loop by the front door.

238
00:11:00,617 --> 00:11:02,091
All these losers
are gonna see it,

239
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:04,412
and they will never
let me live this down.

240
00:11:04,518 --> 00:11:06,840
All those losers will be too
busy ordering jalapeño poppers

241
00:11:06,877 --> 00:11:08,501
to watch some stupid
welcome video.

242
00:11:08,607 --> 00:11:11,433
- I'm not going.
- Come on, Mandy-pants.

243
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:13,590
If you don't go, they'll just
laugh at you behind your back.

244
00:11:13,626 --> 00:11:15,482
And besides, if you're there,

245
00:11:15,887 --> 00:11:18,511
you'll know who to
punish tomorrow.

246
00:11:19,317 --> 00:11:21,490
Well, I do like
punishing people.

247
00:11:23,686 --> 00:11:25,201
Your 3:00 is here.

248
00:11:25,305 --> 00:11:27,261
I don't have a 3:00.

249
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:28,673
You do now.

250
00:11:28,777 --> 00:11:30,941
Daniel Meade, Tyler Blake.

251
00:11:31,045 --> 00:11:33,050
Tyler works at the
magazine "Psychology Now,"

252
00:11:33,157 --> 00:11:35,500
you know, on the 14th floor?
He's here to help you

253
00:11:35,606 --> 00:11:38,140
with... your sex problems.

254
00:11:41,706 --> 00:11:43,041
What is the matter with you?

255
00:11:43,146 --> 00:11:45,662
You went down to the 14th floor,
grabbed the first guy you saw,

256
00:11:45,677 --> 00:11:46,580
told him I'm a freak?

257
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:48,221
Actually, he's the
third guy I saw.

258
00:11:48,406 --> 00:11:50,420
The first two thought
you were a lost cause.

259
00:11:51,226 --> 00:11:54,763
Come on, Daniel, he specializes
in sexual compulsion issues.

260
00:11:55,935 --> 00:12:00,391
Okay, well, I'm sure that that
has some therapeutic value?

261
00:12:03,795 --> 00:12:06,973
I am not spilling my guts out
to some hack magazine writer.

262
00:12:07,076 --> 00:12:10,320
If you're not gonna get the help,
then I'm going to bring the help to you.

263
00:12:15,457 --> 00:12:16,573
Betty Suarez.

264
00:12:16,675 --> 00:12:19,370
Oh, hi.
Thank you so much for calling me back.

265
00:12:19,475 --> 00:12:23,332
What? No,
$1,100 is still too expensive.

266
00:12:23,436 --> 00:12:24,682
Hold on. Where are you going?

267
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,273
To a model casting session.
I am not doing this, Betty.

268
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:30,281
No, Daniel, you're not going anywhere.
I've made this very easy for you.

269
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:33,052
No, I said he has to be in Mexico
by friday. I already told you that.

270
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:34,240
- Who?
- My father.

271
00:12:34,345 --> 00:12:36,841
He's gonna be deported if we can't
get him to Mexico for his visa,

272
00:12:36,876 --> 00:12:38,510
and we don't even have the
money to pay for his ticket.

273
00:12:38,548 --> 00:12:40,172
Oh, and here you are--you
have everything,

274
00:12:40,205 --> 00:12:42,062
and you won't even make the
effort to help yourself.

275
00:12:42,097 --> 00:12:44,171
You know what? Forget about it.
Go with your models.

276
00:12:44,276 --> 00:12:45,150
I give up!

277
00:12:45,256 --> 00:12:48,601
Okay, jeez. Now you've ruined
the whole model thing for me.

278
00:12:48,796 --> 00:12:50,371
Why didn't you tell
me about your father?

279
00:12:50,407 --> 00:12:52,290
Because I didn't
want to bother you.

280
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,912
You have problems of
your own to deal with.

281
00:12:53,947 --> 00:12:55,372
Is there anything
I can do to help?

282
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:56,622
You wanna help me, Daniel?

283
00:12:56,725 --> 00:12:58,522
Then go in there
and talk to Tyler

284
00:12:58,626 --> 00:13:00,281
and try and get better.

285
00:13:08,898 --> 00:13:11,580
No! Don't do it!

286
00:13:12,005 --> 00:13:14,420
Barbra didn't cut her nails to
play "Yentl." Why should you?

287
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:15,763
I have no choice.

288
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:17,381
If I don't cut them,
Valerie fails me.

289
00:13:17,487 --> 00:13:20,122
Then she is a disgrace
to cosmetology.

290
00:13:20,225 --> 00:13:21,230
You know what, mom?

291
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:22,852
She's your Mr. Weaver.

292
00:13:22,957 --> 00:13:24,670
Your drama teacher?

293
00:13:24,776 --> 00:13:26,022
What'd he do now?

294
00:13:26,126 --> 00:13:29,133
He cast Joey Colano as
Tony in "West Side Story."

295
00:13:29,236 --> 00:13:30,953
Well, what part do you play?

296
00:13:31,106 --> 00:13:32,612
I'm his understudy.

297
00:13:32,717 --> 00:13:34,800
Oh. I'm sorry.

298
00:13:34,905 --> 00:13:36,292
But this isn't about me.

299
00:13:36,396 --> 00:13:37,932
This is about you.

300
00:13:38,037 --> 00:13:39,362
You're a grown-up, mom.

301
00:13:39,467 --> 00:13:40,961
You can do whatever you want.

302
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:42,882
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

303
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,580
Yeah, screw that place! I quit!

304
00:13:45,936 --> 00:13:47,851
Now go get me my "Fiji Sunset."

305
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,482
Mommy needs a touch-up.

306
00:13:52,908 --> 00:13:55,163
Oh, my god, is that a bruise?

307
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:56,711
Where did you get that?

308
00:13:56,817 --> 00:13:58,801
- Yoga.
- Hey, no touching.

309
00:13:59,977 --> 00:14:02,971
Come on, mom, you don't have to act
all tough for me. Are you okay in here?

310
00:14:03,065 --> 00:14:06,460
Please, this is cake.
How many rehabs have I been through?

311
00:14:07,987 --> 00:14:11,841
At least here you can score a
decent glass of toilet wine.

312
00:14:12,787 --> 00:14:13,970
So what's bothering you?

313
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:16,891
Aside from the fact that my
mother's drinking toilet wine?

314
00:14:18,418 --> 00:14:19,980
It's Rodrigo.

315
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,642
I think I'm falling for him.

316
00:14:23,017 --> 00:14:25,912
He wants me to move to Rio.

317
00:14:26,016 --> 00:14:27,433
And what do you want?

318
00:14:27,747 --> 00:14:29,111
I don't know.

319
00:14:29,245 --> 00:14:32,860
Honey, as hard as it's been with
your father and me over the years,

320
00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:35,200
we've always stood
by each other.

321
00:14:35,465 --> 00:14:37,631
And if you feel that you've
found that with somebody,

322
00:14:37,738 --> 00:14:40,973
you follow him
wherever he goes.

323
00:14:41,075 --> 00:14:43,932
Also, Brazilian men...

324
00:14:44,056 --> 00:14:45,990
caliente.

325
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:47,811
Oh, mom.

326
00:14:49,165 --> 00:14:53,491
Just... don't completely
disappear on me again.

327
00:14:53,606 --> 00:14:54,902
I won't, mom.

328
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:56,892
I should go.

329
00:14:58,157 --> 00:15:01,302
Try and be more careful with
the yoga next time, okay?

330
00:15:09,556 --> 00:15:12,090
You're in my seat, fish.

331
00:15:15,057 --> 00:15:17,001
Hello, Yoga.

332
00:15:19,087 --> 00:15:20,861
You think the hat is
too much for prison?

333
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:23,103
Mm, it looked okay when you
wore it to visit Martha.

334
00:15:23,206 --> 00:15:26,561
I was trying to detract from that
god awful sweater she knitted me.

335
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:29,661
Why are you going to visit that
gangly old boozehound Claire, anyway?

336
00:15:29,768 --> 00:15:32,321
Because Bradford
refuses to divorce her,

337
00:15:32,426 --> 00:15:34,241
and I refuse to accept it.

338
00:15:34,348 --> 00:15:35,683
So I'm thinking

339
00:15:35,888 --> 00:15:40,582
maybe I can convince
Claire to divorce him.

340
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:42,323
Oh... Wait.

341
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:44,900
Will you be back in time for that
luncheon for the homeless children?

342
00:15:44,935 --> 00:15:47,933
Well, if I'm not, make sure they
get their free hair products.

343
00:15:48,038 --> 00:15:49,421
Priorities, Marc.

344
00:15:49,526 --> 00:15:50,953
Priorities.

345
00:15:51,356 --> 00:15:53,290
I still have so much to learn.

346
00:15:53,598 --> 00:15:56,893
You seek out sex so you won't
have to deal with your problems.

347
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,090
Come on, I think you're
reading too much into this.

348
00:15:59,197 --> 00:16:01,320
I just really like having sex.

349
00:16:01,426 --> 00:16:02,920
You gotta put your
brakes on, man.

350
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,062
- Face your life.
- Can I just face it tomorrow?

351
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:08,212
I have a really hot
date tonight. Look.

352
00:16:09,508 --> 00:16:12,692
She's a model, plus,
she's allergic to pants.

353
00:16:12,796 --> 00:16:14,892
Seriously, she
can't keep 'em on.

354
00:16:15,048 --> 00:16:16,422
What's her name?

355
00:16:16,658 --> 00:16:17,681
Marla.

356
00:16:17,787 --> 00:16:19,223
Marla what?

357
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:23,460
Look, that's my point.

358
00:16:23,725 --> 00:16:27,781
If you're serious about getting help, why
don't you and Marla go out on a sexless date?

359
00:16:27,888 --> 00:16:29,501
You mean, like, talking?

360
00:16:29,606 --> 00:16:32,720
Either you take a stand right now,
or it gets worse.

361
00:16:43,566 --> 00:16:45,892
Greetings, lords and ladies.

362
00:16:45,998 --> 00:16:50,390
'Tis mine honor to warmly
welcomest thou to the Middle Ages.

363
00:16:50,498 --> 00:16:54,191
Squire Josh Weinstock
at thy service.

364
00:16:54,298 --> 00:16:56,920
Here are your
complimentary crowns.

365
00:16:57,025 --> 00:17:00,501
Enjoy yon merriment.

366
00:17:02,906 --> 00:17:04,980
All right, Betty,
the sooner you tackle that horsey,

367
00:17:04,998 --> 00:17:07,612
the sooner I tackle
something in a codpiece.

368
00:17:08,035 --> 00:17:11,533
This is gonna be the easiest
1,000 bucks I've ever earned.

369
00:17:16,408 --> 00:17:18,901
I think thou might be screwed.

370
00:17:21,488 --> 00:17:23,533
Will you people stop
pushing Acapulco?

371
00:17:23,635 --> 00:17:26,420
He needs to go to
Guadalajara for his visa.

372
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,700
Don't you have some
sort of a special fare?

373
00:17:28,827 --> 00:17:30,600
Well, what if I put
him in a pet carrier?

374
00:17:30,707 --> 00:17:31,693
Hey.

375
00:17:31,797 --> 00:17:35,641
Well, thank you. You have been
absolutely no help, hijo de--

376
00:17:36,695 --> 00:17:37,963
perra.

377
00:17:39,366 --> 00:17:41,140
You know,
it's not worth all this.

378
00:17:41,248 --> 00:17:43,570
Papi, stop it.
We gotta get the money for your ticket.

379
00:17:43,678 --> 00:17:45,022
Hilda, I don't have to go.

380
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,713
I've been living here
for 30 years already.

381
00:17:47,815 --> 00:17:51,170
- What if I just stayed?
- No, you have to go.

382
00:17:51,275 --> 00:17:54,033
Look, "You must return to
your country of origin,

383
00:17:54,138 --> 00:17:56,260
"and reenter this
country legally,"

384
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,722
or you're screwed.

385
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,061
Okay, well,
it doesn't say "screwed," but,

386
00:18:00,168 --> 00:18:02,280
papi, you will be.

387
00:18:02,385 --> 00:18:04,253
We don't have the money.

388
00:18:04,578 --> 00:18:06,061
This is my problem,

389
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:07,291
not yours

390
00:18:07,398 --> 00:18:08,953
and not Betty's.

391
00:18:10,295 --> 00:18:12,423
I'm not going.

392
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:26,490
So much to make fun of,

393
00:18:26,598 --> 00:18:28,740
I don't know where to begin.

394
00:18:29,146 --> 00:18:30,651
This is so gay.

395
00:18:30,756 --> 00:18:32,353
No, it's not.

396
00:18:36,188 --> 00:18:37,551
Oh, my god. There it is.

397
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,673
Greetings, lords and ladies.

398
00:18:39,777 --> 00:18:41,680
Welcome to the Middle Ages--

399
00:18:41,785 --> 00:18:44,423
a magical journey through time.

400
00:18:44,526 --> 00:18:46,491
- Hey, that's not you.
- I've been de-wenched.

401
00:18:46,596 --> 00:18:48,610
That's good news, right?
Now you don't have to be embarrassed.

402
00:18:48,645 --> 00:18:51,201
No. No,
they put in a younger girl.

403
00:18:51,305 --> 00:18:53,301
Kids under 12 eat
free on sundays.

404
00:18:53,405 --> 00:18:55,330
- So what, now I'm too old?
- I'm not following.

405
00:18:55,438 --> 00:18:57,350
I'm going nowhere at "Mode,"

406
00:18:57,455 --> 00:18:59,481
and now I'm apparently
too old to be a wench.

407
00:18:59,586 --> 00:19:02,401
How long before I'm too
old to be a receptionist?

408
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:09,650
Sure, today I'm the eye candy,
but tomorrow I'll be old candy--

409
00:19:09,755 --> 00:19:12,712
old, hard,
wrinkly candy covered in lint.

410
00:19:12,816 --> 00:19:14,110
Are you having a stroke?

411
00:19:14,217 --> 00:19:16,141
Maybe. I'm old enough.

412
00:19:25,476 --> 00:19:27,740
I have to get out of here.
This was a big mistake.

413
00:19:27,845 --> 00:19:29,933
Don't give up yet.
Maybe there's a drinking contest.

414
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,581
I've won those before.

415
00:19:35,506 --> 00:19:36,582
Hello?

416
00:19:36,686 --> 00:19:38,681
- Get home now.
- What's wrong?

417
00:19:38,786 --> 00:19:41,441
I know you have your whole
Secretaries Day party--

418
00:19:41,545 --> 00:19:44,713
- Administrative Pro--
- Shut up. I need you home now.

419
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,422
Papi? Flipping out.

420
00:19:46,525 --> 00:19:48,582
- I'm totally calm.
- You're flipping out!

421
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,892
He is threatening not to go to Mexico.
He says, you know, we can't afford it,

422
00:19:51,996 --> 00:19:53,740
so he's just--he's
just gonna give up.

423
00:19:53,845 --> 00:19:57,161
You gotta come home. You just gotta
help me talk some sense into him.

424
00:19:57,267 --> 00:19:58,820
Tell him I'm coming home,

425
00:19:58,995 --> 00:20:01,301
and I'm bringing the
money for his ticket.

426
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,281
All right.
So let me make you a cup of coffee.

427
00:20:11,386 --> 00:20:12,960
Get in here.

428
00:20:13,085 --> 00:20:15,512
No, no, no, no, no.
No bedroom. Come on.

429
00:20:15,616 --> 00:20:17,621
We're having fun.
We're talking.

430
00:20:17,726 --> 00:20:19,550
I wanna get to know
the--the inner you.

431
00:20:19,655 --> 00:20:20,811
Let me show it to you.

432
00:20:20,915 --> 00:20:23,000
You don't, um, have to do that.

433
00:20:23,108 --> 00:20:24,390
Why don't we play a game?

434
00:20:24,497 --> 00:20:25,672
- Use our minds.
- Yeah!

435
00:20:25,777 --> 00:20:27,540
Look, chess. Perfect.

436
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,481
And these are...

437
00:20:29,587 --> 00:20:32,081
Condoms--I'm good at that game.

438
00:20:33,905 --> 00:20:36,162
There's TV. How about that?

439
00:20:36,715 --> 00:20:38,463
"The Notebook"--
I love that movie.

440
00:20:38,566 --> 00:20:42,461
Oh, my god. That scene in the
rain makes me want to get naked.

441
00:20:42,728 --> 00:20:44,640
Or, um, "Hotel Rwanda."

442
00:20:44,747 --> 00:20:47,242
Daniel, what's the deal?
The last time we got together,

443
00:20:47,345 --> 00:20:49,592
we didn't even make
it out of the cab.

444
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:53,100
I'm just trying to have a
different kind of night.

445
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,810
Look, can I ask you a question?

446
00:20:57,747 --> 00:21:01,211
Seriously, do you think I'm addicted...
to sex?

447
00:21:01,475 --> 00:21:02,902
Yeah!

448
00:21:06,048 --> 00:21:08,363
- Hey, Betty.
- Hi.

449
00:21:08,466 --> 00:21:09,702
Isn't this place great?

450
00:21:09,805 --> 00:21:11,533
Usually mutton is so dry.

451
00:21:14,037 --> 00:21:17,040
Oh, my god.
You're gonna tame the jousting steed?

452
00:21:17,148 --> 00:21:20,551
Yeah. Yeah, it's no big deal.
I have thighs of...

453
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:22,352
Never mind.

454
00:21:22,456 --> 00:21:25,650
Maybe we should just go play
darts instead. Much safer.

455
00:21:25,755 --> 00:21:27,121
No, no, no, no, no.

456
00:21:27,978 --> 00:21:29,480
- I have to do this.
- Why?

457
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:30,542
It's complicated.

458
00:21:30,648 --> 00:21:32,540
She needs money to
help her father.

459
00:21:35,956 --> 00:21:38,311
Ooh, look at that.
We're all out of drinks.

460
00:21:38,987 --> 00:21:40,511
- You not doing this.
- Henry.

461
00:21:40,616 --> 00:21:42,202
- I'll do it.
- What?

462
00:21:42,526 --> 00:21:45,002
But I-can't let you do this.

463
00:21:45,108 --> 00:21:47,711
Betty, my grandparents
had horses.

464
00:21:47,815 --> 00:21:49,800
I never got near them
'cause I'm allergic,

465
00:21:49,905 --> 00:21:51,552
but I used to watch them
out the window all the time.

466
00:21:51,585 --> 00:21:53,151
Let me do this for you.

467
00:21:55,176 --> 00:21:57,490
Um, okay.

468
00:22:04,766 --> 00:22:05,861
Hello.

469
00:22:06,488 --> 00:22:08,643
I told you I was gonna
be at the Middle Ages.

470
00:22:08,816 --> 00:22:11,012
Well, yeah,
Betty's here. It's--

471
00:22:11,118 --> 00:22:13,582
Charlie, we are not having
this conversation again.

472
00:22:14,025 --> 00:22:15,483
Will you excuse
me for a second?

473
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:16,822
I'll be right back.

474
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,103
Charlie says hi.

475
00:22:27,607 --> 00:22:30,593
I know I'm the last person
you wanna see, Claire.

476
00:22:30,756 --> 00:22:33,643
It's just that it's
about Bradford.

477
00:22:33,747 --> 00:22:36,110
He's just been so depressed.

478
00:22:36,217 --> 00:22:37,861
His wife's in prison.

479
00:22:37,967 --> 00:22:41,910
Wouldn't that make you just
the tiniest bit depressed?

480
00:22:42,016 --> 00:22:44,043
- Of course it would.
- Why are you really here, Wilhelmina?

481
00:22:44,077 --> 00:22:46,011
You're nothing but
a selfish bitch.

482
00:22:46,237 --> 00:22:49,390
Oh, pardon my language.

483
00:22:49,716 --> 00:22:51,482
Prison has hardened me.

484
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:55,012
Claire, I'm simply a
concerned observer.

485
00:22:55,115 --> 00:22:57,830
Just because your life
has been put on hold,

486
00:22:57,937 --> 00:23:00,933
doesn't mean Bradford
should have to be.

487
00:23:01,955 --> 00:23:05,992
Oh, you poor, stupid woman.

488
00:23:06,096 --> 00:23:08,052
Look at those toes.

489
00:23:09,496 --> 00:23:11,323
You're sleeping with him,
aren't you?

490
00:23:11,425 --> 00:23:14,833
Well, I certainly hope you
don't think it means anything.

491
00:23:14,938 --> 00:23:16,843
It's hardly an exclusive club.

492
00:23:16,945 --> 00:23:19,772
Well, if that were true,
dear, then why on earth

493
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:23,542
would you have to cut
the brakes in Fey's car?

494
00:23:23,647 --> 00:23:26,512
Or were you threatened...

495
00:23:27,748 --> 00:23:29,231
like now?

496
00:23:32,235 --> 00:23:34,311
Listen to me,

497
00:23:35,337 --> 00:23:36,713
you slut!

498
00:23:36,817 --> 00:23:40,971
There's a hundred women in here I could have
slit your throat for a pack of menthols,

499
00:23:41,077 --> 00:23:44,123
and I've got a whole
carton in my cell.

500
00:23:44,226 --> 00:23:46,283
Stay away from my husband,

501
00:23:46,386 --> 00:23:49,511
you degenerate piece of human filth,
or you're dead!

502
00:23:49,615 --> 00:23:52,150
You hear me? Dead!

503
00:23:55,566 --> 00:23:56,622
Willie?

504
00:23:56,788 --> 00:23:59,063
What? Now?

505
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:01,091
- Hey, grandma.
- Hi.

506
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:06,301
Next up to ride the steed,
sir Henry Grubstick!

507
00:24:06,406 --> 00:24:08,632
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Henry!

508
00:24:08,735 --> 00:24:11,511
Charlie, this is crazy.
Will you stop being so jealous?

509
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:14,500
- Henry!
- Last call for sir Grubstick!

510
00:24:19,276 --> 00:24:21,261
I'm sir Grubstick.

511
00:24:21,705 --> 00:24:22,963
Hello.

512
00:24:32,225 --> 00:24:34,221
Look, I couldn't do it.

513
00:24:36,157 --> 00:24:39,163
We had sex during
"Hotel Rwanda."

514
00:24:39,446 --> 00:24:41,342
Okay, that--that is a first,

515
00:24:41,487 --> 00:24:43,441
but I told you,
cold turkey is hard.

516
00:24:43,545 --> 00:24:44,970
They don't make
a patch for this.

517
00:24:45,076 --> 00:24:47,960
It will take every ounce
of willpower you have.

518
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:49,802
I don't think I can do this.

519
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,501
Daniel, I have a
confession to make.

520
00:24:55,276 --> 00:24:58,482
Five years ago,
I was where you are right now.

521
00:24:58,585 --> 00:25:00,003
I doubt that, Tyler.

522
00:25:00,107 --> 00:25:01,431
Skipping work,

523
00:25:01,636 --> 00:25:03,082
ignoring my friends.

524
00:25:03,186 --> 00:25:06,723
I left my family on Christmas
Eve to go to a strip club.

525
00:25:06,828 --> 00:25:08,172
What am I supposed to do?

526
00:25:08,275 --> 00:25:10,443
Find something that helps
you focus on other things.

527
00:25:10,545 --> 00:25:13,571
Like what, stamp collecting?

528
00:25:14,195 --> 00:25:15,922
You wanna know
how I got through?

529
00:25:20,836 --> 00:25:21,983
What is this?

530
00:25:22,185 --> 00:25:24,352
Something I found overseas.

531
00:25:25,987 --> 00:25:29,500
Next time, instead of sex,
this is your distraction.

532
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:33,390
Hear ye! Hear ye!

533
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:36,991
Behold--sir Grubstick!

534
00:25:37,095 --> 00:25:39,092
Um, it's Betty... Suarez.

535
00:25:39,195 --> 00:25:42,032
Okay, Betty, uh, good luck.

536
00:25:45,196 --> 00:25:47,320
You're gonna break
the horse, Betty.

537
00:25:47,425 --> 00:25:49,853
You get it? 'Cause she's fat, right?
Lock it up!

538
00:26:10,537 --> 00:26:13,700
Ten seconds to go!

539
00:26:14,327 --> 00:26:16,750
Ten, nine...

540
00:26:20,336 --> 00:26:22,900
six, five,

541
00:26:23,006 --> 00:26:25,493
four, three...

542
00:26:30,408 --> 00:26:31,950
Oh, my god. Betty?

543
00:26:32,938 --> 00:26:35,303
Are you okay? Betty?

544
00:26:37,856 --> 00:26:39,533
I couldn't do it.

545
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:44,192
That's right.
You got a piece of the pep.

546
00:26:44,296 --> 00:26:45,960
Drop a pound!

547
00:26:46,217 --> 00:26:48,350
What's the matter with you?
She could've been hurt.

548
00:26:48,456 --> 00:26:51,372
Whatever. Brace-face
jacked my yogurt.

549
00:26:57,188 --> 00:26:58,362
My lords!

550
00:26:58,468 --> 00:27:02,220
All quarrels in the Middle
Ages are settled one way--

551
00:27:02,327 --> 00:27:05,183
on the log...

552
00:27:05,288 --> 00:27:07,570
or we lose our liquor license.

553
00:27:07,678 --> 00:27:11,022
Log! Log! Log! Log! Log! Log!


554
00:27:11,128 --> 00:27:14,623
Oh, it's about to
get nerd-nasty.

555
00:27:17,725 --> 00:27:21,092
Bradford thinks his wife
isn't really a monster.

556
00:27:21,196 --> 00:27:23,830
So let's show him what
she's capable of.

557
00:27:23,935 --> 00:27:26,662
I want you to hit me
as hard as you can.

558
00:27:26,768 --> 00:27:29,692
Willie, isn't that a little extreme,
even for you?

559
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:31,973
Don't pretend you've
never wanted to do it.

560
00:27:32,127 --> 00:27:33,862
Now's your chance.

561
00:27:35,188 --> 00:27:37,761
- This isn't a trap?
- Go for it!

562
00:27:40,048 --> 00:27:43,401
Hit me like a man, you pansy!

563
00:27:45,348 --> 00:27:46,911
Wilhelmina Slater.

564
00:27:47,017 --> 00:27:49,480
I need visible bruises,
damn it!

565
00:27:49,996 --> 00:27:53,343
Who do you think made sure you didn't
get a raise the past two years?

566
00:27:53,445 --> 00:27:56,211
Who do you think cut
your vacation time?

567
00:27:56,315 --> 00:27:59,340
Who do you think broke
into your computer

568
00:27:59,446 --> 00:28:01,471
and canceled your subscription

569
00:28:01,578 --> 00:28:05,170
to Dudecruise.com?

570
00:28:13,217 --> 00:28:14,543
Harder.

571
00:28:43,796 --> 00:28:45,243
Henry, look,

572
00:28:45,346 --> 00:28:48,561
I know you believe in all this chivalry
stuff, but you don't have to defend my honor.

573
00:28:48,598 --> 00:28:50,831
Yes, I do.

574
00:28:53,075 --> 00:28:54,611
Don't forget your crown.

575
00:29:02,405 --> 00:29:04,692
Romantic little banger,
isn't he?

576
00:29:07,486 --> 00:29:09,121
Let's have a nice, clean fight.

577
00:29:09,226 --> 00:29:12,220
No punching, no kicking,
no hitting below thy belt.

578
00:29:12,326 --> 00:29:14,253
Let's do this, beeyotch.

579
00:29:49,045 --> 00:29:52,441
I am unmanned!

580
00:30:09,177 --> 00:30:11,971
Oh, boo to the black knight!

581
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:16,450
Come on! Give him a right hook!

582
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:19,470
Come on, Henry!
Give him a big old--

583
00:30:26,148 --> 00:30:31,170
He's done! I'm the winner! I'm the
winner! I'm the winner! Yeah! Yeah!

584
00:30:31,275 --> 00:30:32,412
Stop it!

585
00:30:33,178 --> 00:30:34,180
Henry!

586
00:30:34,286 --> 00:30:36,081
Yeah! He's done!

587
00:30:38,195 --> 00:30:39,521
Did I win?

588
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:41,782
Oh, my god. I'm so sorry.

589
00:30:42,376 --> 00:30:43,933
I love you.

590
00:30:47,916 --> 00:30:50,232
Henry. Henry.

591
00:30:50,525 --> 00:30:52,342
Did you just say "I love you"?

592
00:30:52,447 --> 00:30:53,781
Henry, wake up!

593
00:30:53,888 --> 00:30:55,243
What did you say?!

594
00:30:55,348 --> 00:30:57,823
- Ow.
- Oh. I'm sorry.

595
00:31:00,865 --> 00:31:03,720
- Charlie?
- No, it's--it's Betty.

596
00:31:03,825 --> 00:31:05,522
No, it's Charlie.

597
00:31:07,497 --> 00:31:10,863
Oh. Um, hi.

598
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:13,021
How--how long have
you been here?

599
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:16,432
Long enough to wonder why my
boyfriend's getting hurt defending you.

600
00:31:16,535 --> 00:31:18,733
No, no, you don't understand.

601
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:21,461
Um, it's not what
it looks like.

602
00:31:21,567 --> 00:31:24,503
I'm not stupid, Betty, okay?
I've seen the way he looks at you.

603
00:31:24,606 --> 00:31:27,713
Look, I swear,
I didn't mean for this to happen.

604
00:31:27,815 --> 00:31:29,192
Maybe you didn't,

605
00:31:29,298 --> 00:31:33,093
but there's a reason that fairy
tales don't have two princesses.

606
00:31:33,198 --> 00:31:37,532
He's my boyfriend,
so back off, Betty.

607
00:31:44,927 --> 00:31:45,852
You serious?

608
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:47,893
Yes. I'm coming to Brazil!

609
00:31:47,996 --> 00:31:49,922
Oh, we need to celebrate.

610
00:31:50,027 --> 00:31:51,513
Pour us some more champagne,

611
00:31:51,615 --> 00:31:53,830
I'll light some candles
and run us a bath.

612
00:31:53,938 --> 00:31:56,502
Cheesy, but it works.

613
00:32:06,305 --> 00:32:07,971
Everything is going
according to plan.

614
00:32:08,078 --> 00:32:09,940
You're sure she
agreed to leave?

615
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:12,183
I promise, Bradford.
She'll be gone.

616
00:32:12,285 --> 00:32:15,330
She's coming to Brazil, and I don't
think she'll want to come back.

617
00:32:23,157 --> 00:32:26,503
It is you. I can't believe it.

618
00:32:26,605 --> 00:32:29,612
You're the old serving wench.
I'm the new serving wench.

619
00:32:29,717 --> 00:32:30,883
I know who you are.

620
00:32:30,988 --> 00:32:32,582
You replaced me.

621
00:32:32,686 --> 00:32:33,823
Step off, skipper.

622
00:32:33,926 --> 00:32:36,403
I-I didn't want to replace you.
I totally meant my performance

623
00:32:36,467 --> 00:32:38,081
as a homage to yours.

624
00:32:38,188 --> 00:32:39,810
Did Marc put you up to this?

625
00:32:39,918 --> 00:32:43,221
Does Marc work at "Mode" with you?
Are you his boss?

626
00:32:43,585 --> 00:32:45,883
- Kind of.
- You guys are so fancy.

627
00:32:45,987 --> 00:32:48,191
You must get to meet
all the big stars.

628
00:32:48,298 --> 00:32:51,693
Well, I...
did get a water for Brad Pitt once.

629
00:32:53,128 --> 00:32:54,810
Still have the bottle.

630
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:03,162
I know you were on the
phone with my father.

631
00:33:03,268 --> 00:33:05,593
Oh, amor, it is just business.

632
00:33:05,795 --> 00:33:07,251
Like our relationship?

633
00:33:07,358 --> 00:33:08,442
What are you talking about?

634
00:33:08,548 --> 00:33:11,993
My father paid you to seduce me so
I'd go back to Brazil with you.

635
00:33:12,525 --> 00:33:14,170
Alexis, wait.

636
00:33:15,387 --> 00:33:16,823
I may be a woman...

637
00:33:16,925 --> 00:33:19,721
but I still know how
to hit like a man.

638
00:33:38,876 --> 00:33:41,243
Relax. Betty said
she'd get the money.

639
00:33:41,347 --> 00:33:43,320
I told you, I'm not going.

640
00:33:43,428 --> 00:33:46,493
Ay, papi, this is crazy.
Why wouldn't you want to go?

641
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,561
Lawyers make a lot of promises.

642
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:51,570
I don't know what's gonna
happen when I go down there.

643
00:33:51,605 --> 00:33:53,270
I may not be able to get back.

644
00:33:53,375 --> 00:33:55,733
Would you stop
talking like that?

645
00:33:55,835 --> 00:33:58,280
You need to be prepared
to step up, mija.

646
00:33:58,386 --> 00:34:00,072
What? I mean, Betty's--

647
00:34:00,176 --> 00:34:01,460
No Betty.

648
00:34:01,567 --> 00:34:04,300
You need to pull it together.
You're the oldest.

649
00:34:04,407 --> 00:34:05,491
You have a son.

650
00:34:05,596 --> 00:34:08,140
You're out of a job,
and you just quit beauty school.

651
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:10,351
Well, I didn't
wanna quit. Okay?

652
00:34:10,455 --> 00:34:12,731
But they just--
they stopped appreciating all of this.

653
00:34:12,836 --> 00:34:14,213
You're an adult, Hilda.

654
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:18,062
I'm not going anywhere until I know
you're able to take care of this family.

655
00:34:43,115 --> 00:34:45,451
He said it, Christina.
I know he did.

656
00:34:45,557 --> 00:34:47,072
How could he leave with her?

657
00:34:47,175 --> 00:34:50,022
Maybe that twit Nick Pepper
scrambled his brains.

658
00:34:50,128 --> 00:34:52,781
It doesn't really matter what
he said because he chose her.

659
00:34:52,887 --> 00:34:55,181
Because she moved 3,000
miles to be with him.

660
00:34:55,285 --> 00:34:57,631
He's just doing the honorable thing.
He's a good guy,

661
00:34:57,738 --> 00:34:59,971
which is why you fell for
him in the first place.

662
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:00,993
I know.

663
00:35:01,095 --> 00:35:03,781
What do you need a boyfriend for anyway?
Ah, they're overrated.

664
00:35:03,885 --> 00:35:07,033
I don't need one.
It was just... it was nice,

665
00:35:07,135 --> 00:35:10,033
you know,
having somebody rescue me for a change.

666
00:35:12,998 --> 00:35:14,472
Especially him.

667
00:35:14,986 --> 00:35:16,622
Do you want to know the truth?

668
00:35:16,945 --> 00:35:19,232
You can take care of
yourself, princess.

669
00:35:24,277 --> 00:35:26,590
Watch me pound this brew, bro!

670
00:35:28,398 --> 00:35:29,492
Yes.

671
00:35:30,156 --> 00:35:33,702
You want some pepper,
you're gonna get the spice.

672
00:35:33,807 --> 00:35:35,950
Secretaries Day!

673
00:35:36,556 --> 00:35:39,453
It's Administrative
Professionals Day.

674
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:43,760
What's up, yogurt thief?
Where's sir Dorko to defend your honor?

675
00:35:44,248 --> 00:35:47,100
Sir Dorko--that was awesome.

676
00:35:52,015 --> 00:35:53,462
Hey, Nick.

677
00:35:56,227 --> 00:35:58,331
I can defend myself.

678
00:35:58,436 --> 00:35:59,662
Thank you.

679
00:36:14,487 --> 00:36:16,620
What are you doing
here, Suarez?

680
00:36:16,728 --> 00:36:18,051
I'm finishing this course

681
00:36:18,156 --> 00:36:19,440
so I can take care
of my family.

682
00:36:19,546 --> 00:36:21,710
I was hoping I scared you off.

683
00:36:21,818 --> 00:36:23,051
I'm not a kid.

684
00:36:23,157 --> 00:36:24,962
I don't scare that easy.

685
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:29,502
Okay, people.
We're being timed on this starting now.

686
00:36:29,607 --> 00:36:31,410
So brush it high

687
00:36:31,516 --> 00:36:33,612
or say good-bye.

688
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:47,811
Okay, so your perm checks out,

689
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:50,511
which brings us to nails.

690
00:36:51,408 --> 00:36:54,790
Suarez, is there some reason that your
model here doesn't have a manicure?

691
00:36:54,898 --> 00:36:56,672
The test said I had
to do a manicure.

692
00:36:56,778 --> 00:36:59,203
It just didn't say on who.

693
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:04,362
I wasn't gonna waste all that
hotness on somebody else.

694
00:37:07,365 --> 00:37:10,000
Oh, you guys, it's no big deal.

695
00:37:10,106 --> 00:37:12,233
I did all of these one-handed.

696
00:37:14,437 --> 00:37:15,893
Pass.

697
00:37:16,697 --> 00:37:19,702
Okay, people, back to work.
Show's over.

698
00:37:24,496 --> 00:37:25,822
It's Claire again.

699
00:37:28,926 --> 00:37:30,960
I can't believe she
had this done to you.

700
00:37:31,068 --> 00:37:33,493
It was just so horrible.

701
00:37:34,095 --> 00:37:35,881
Those three thugs...

702
00:37:35,986 --> 00:37:37,912
pulled me into
that alley and...

703
00:37:38,018 --> 00:37:40,111
they even tore my Chanel.

704
00:37:40,215 --> 00:37:42,263
I guess I was wrong about her.

705
00:37:43,436 --> 00:37:45,590
She's not the woman
I thought she was.

706
00:37:45,698 --> 00:37:47,312
What does that mean?

707
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:48,960
Our marriage is over.

708
00:37:49,295 --> 00:37:51,383
I'll talk to the
lawyer tomorrow.

709
00:37:51,487 --> 00:37:54,140
There's still this ringing
in my ear from the trauma.

710
00:37:54,248 --> 00:37:55,853
What did--what did you say?

711
00:37:56,165 --> 00:37:58,920
I'm divorcing Claire.

712
00:38:00,425 --> 00:38:01,870
Bradford.

713
00:38:02,597 --> 00:38:05,772
You have no idea how
much this means to me.

714
00:38:06,068 --> 00:38:08,931
Will you be a dear and
get me a glass of water?

715
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:12,391
I'm... I need to
take my pain pills.

716
00:38:29,826 --> 00:38:31,373
Hello?

717
00:38:34,536 --> 00:38:36,212
Hello?

718
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:43,870
Is this Mr. Wolf?

719
00:38:45,285 --> 00:38:47,750
I heard you might be able
to help me with a problem.

720
00:38:49,848 --> 00:38:51,783
I need it eliminated.

721
00:39:01,148 --> 00:39:03,620
- Good job, Betty.
- Yeah, good arm.

722
00:39:03,728 --> 00:39:06,002
- Hey, good job.
- Thanks.

723
00:39:12,395 --> 00:39:13,883
Way to go, Betty.

724
00:39:15,585 --> 00:39:17,992
Betty, can I speak
with you for a second?

725
00:39:18,096 --> 00:39:19,220
Good morning.

726
00:39:19,325 --> 00:39:20,671
You look good today.

727
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,300
Therapy suits you.

728
00:39:22,406 --> 00:39:24,290
Actually, I don't want to
talk about my problems.

729
00:39:24,325 --> 00:39:26,450
I would like to talk
about yours, however.

730
00:39:26,558 --> 00:39:29,273
I didn't know the
yogurt was his.

731
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:30,661
Not that.

732
00:39:30,765 --> 00:39:32,862
Apparently, you've got
a very thoughtless boss

733
00:39:32,967 --> 00:39:34,361
who didn't realize
until last night

734
00:39:34,406 --> 00:39:37,500
that you deserve a lot
more than a crappy trophy.

735
00:39:44,926 --> 00:39:47,283
- These are tickets.
- To Mexico.

736
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,350
For you and your father and
the rest of your family.

737
00:39:50,537 --> 00:39:52,580
All they had was first class.

738
00:39:52,837 --> 00:39:54,340
I hope you don't mind.

739
00:39:56,597 --> 00:39:58,890
No. No, Daniel. It's too much.

740
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:00,043
Stop it.

741
00:40:00,347 --> 00:40:02,772
You're always there
for everyone else.

742
00:40:02,875 --> 00:40:04,960
Let me be there for you.

743
00:40:05,465 --> 00:40:07,701
Happy Administrative
Professionals Day.

744
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,551
It's Administrative Profe--

745
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:13,492
No, wait. That's right.

746
00:40:19,715 --> 00:40:20,922
Thank you.

747
00:40:24,478 --> 00:40:25,751
Thank you.

748
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,942
I'm gonna go call my family.

749
00:40:36,097 --> 00:40:37,960
Hilda, it's Betty.

750
00:40:38,067 --> 00:40:40,101
Daniel got us
tickets to Mexico.

751
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:44,672
I know.
We're going to Mexico first class.
