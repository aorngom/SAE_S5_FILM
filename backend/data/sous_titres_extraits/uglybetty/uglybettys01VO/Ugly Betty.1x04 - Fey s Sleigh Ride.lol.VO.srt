1
00:00:00,218 --> 00:00:01,721
I made a terrible mistake.

2
00:00:01,731 --> 00:00:05,455
Did you realize this before
or after Gina dumped you?

3
00:00:05,465 --> 00:00:08,834
It's his H.M.O.
They're not gonna cover dad anymore.

4
00:00:09,157 --> 00:00:11,358
Got a weird call
from some woman.

5
00:00:11,368 --> 00:00:14,391
She said to ask you about
Bayonne scrape yard?

6
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:15,414
I haven't the foggiest.

7
00:00:15,424 --> 00:00:18,074
As long as there's this wedge
between the two of them,

8
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:19,705
their relationship is doomed.

9
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:23,521
Perhaps it's time I drive
that wedge a little deeper.

10
00:00:27,095 --> 00:00:28,370
# Can I get, get, get #

11
00:00:28,383 --> 00:00:29,625
# To know, know, know, know you #

12
00:00:29,658 --> 00:00:31,959
# Better, better, baby #

13
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:34,591
Wow, this is so cool.

14
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:37,512
I've always wanted to come to
networking night at the Rack.

15
00:00:37,528 --> 00:00:39,492
And, oh, look!
There's free grilled cheese.

16
00:00:39,505 --> 00:00:40,891
Okay, ground rules.

17
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:42,022
Stop with the chatty,

18
00:00:42,037 --> 00:00:43,463
don't stand so close to me,

19
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:45,820
and no one eats
the grilled cheese.

20
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:47,573
She's having one.

21
00:00:47,725 --> 00:00:50,611
Well, of course Fat Carol is eating one.
What do you expect?

22
00:00:50,626 --> 00:00:52,610
Anyway, so how does this work?

23
00:00:52,628 --> 00:00:54,401
You have to work the room.

24
00:00:54,417 --> 00:00:55,443
"Work the room"?

25
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:58,182
Circulate, baby.
Introduce yourself.

26
00:00:58,197 --> 00:01:01,042
We want everyone to meet you.

27
00:01:01,058 --> 00:01:03,371
Okay. Wish me luck.

28
00:01:03,388 --> 00:01:04,853
Bye.

29
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,683
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:10,957 --> 00:01:12,572
It--it--it's my first time.

31
00:01:12,588 --> 00:01:15,182
More classic moments for
Betty's wall of shame.

32
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:19,562
Hi. Excuse me.

33
00:01:19,905 --> 00:01:22,622
We haven't officially met.
Um, I'm Betty Suarez.

34
00:01:22,637 --> 00:01:24,561
I work at "Mode," too.

35
00:01:26,807 --> 00:01:29,462
I always thought I'd
be good at your job.

36
00:01:29,775 --> 00:01:31,593
How long do you
think you'll last?

37
00:01:31,606 --> 00:01:35,710
Well, unless you know something
that I don't, a while, I hope.

38
00:01:36,246 --> 00:01:37,821
That's too bad.

39
00:01:38,418 --> 00:01:41,321
You know, I love that you're
having a grilled cheese.

40
00:01:41,338 --> 00:01:43,350
Most people at
"Mode" don't eat.

41
00:01:45,517 --> 00:01:47,663
Sometimes they shouldn't.

42
00:01:52,065 --> 00:01:53,473
Just a minute.

43
00:01:55,846 --> 00:01:59,173
Carlo Medina. I work with the
editor in chief at "Isabella."

44
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:02,112
Oh, Betty Suarez,
assistant to Daniel Meade at "Mode."

45
00:02:02,127 --> 00:02:03,713
Oh, I know who you are.

46
00:02:03,727 --> 00:02:05,581
You're a legend.

47
00:02:08,405 --> 00:02:11,902
Housekeeping swears they
haven't seen a red music box.

48
00:02:11,915 --> 00:02:13,642
Any luck?

49
00:02:13,858 --> 00:02:16,160
Does it look like
I've had any luck?

50
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,522
Daniel and Wilhelmina
are still waiting for you

51
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,883
to sign off on the
holiday spread.

52
00:02:20,898 --> 00:02:22,323
What?

53
00:02:22,535 --> 00:02:23,842
Oh.

54
00:02:28,807 --> 00:02:30,163
Keep looking.

55
00:02:37,678 --> 00:02:41,441
Seem to be a lot of layers.
I'd like to see more skin.

56
00:02:41,457 --> 00:02:45,433
It's a postnuclear scene. Exposed
skin would melt off their bodies.

57
00:02:45,446 --> 00:02:46,480
My bad.

58
00:02:46,498 --> 00:02:48,691
I understand you have a
holiday spread for me.

59
00:02:48,707 --> 00:02:51,503
Yeah. Yes, we do.
We think you're gonna like it.

60
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:56,052
In this world of global
warming and political unrest,

61
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:59,733
we give you a
postapocalyptic Christmas.

62
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,883
A "Mad Max-mas" if you will.

63
00:03:01,898 --> 00:03:05,253
I discovered this designer
out of Vietnam-- Anh Vu-Tran--

64
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:07,670
so hot,
no one in the states knows about her.

65
00:03:07,685 --> 00:03:11,432
She's doing an exclusive line
of flak jackets just for us.

66
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:13,702
We got all the props and
equipment on hold for thursday.

67
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:15,121
We just need to
pull the trigger.

68
00:03:15,136 --> 00:03:16,491
So let's walk you
through the mock-ups,

69
00:03:16,527 --> 00:03:17,832
show you what we have in mind.

70
00:03:17,846 --> 00:03:19,621
Yeah, sounds good.

71
00:03:19,637 --> 00:03:21,573
Uh, I have to get
back upstairs.

72
00:03:26,556 --> 00:03:28,630
He was disturbed?

73
00:03:28,648 --> 00:03:31,383
He looked very disturbed.

74
00:03:31,396 --> 00:03:34,203
Mm. He should.

75
00:03:34,337 --> 00:03:37,063
He  got sloppy.

76
00:03:37,097 --> 00:03:38,832
And we got...

77
00:03:38,847 --> 00:03:40,921
a music box.

78
00:03:46,847 --> 00:03:48,610
Sorry I'm late!

79
00:03:48,626 --> 00:03:51,232
I hope you guys didn't
wait for me to eat dinner.

80
00:03:52,638 --> 00:03:54,003
What are you doing here?

81
00:03:54,018 --> 00:03:56,341
- Tuesday's tamale night.
- We broke up.

82
00:03:56,357 --> 00:03:58,480
Walter always comes
on tamale night.

83
00:03:58,497 --> 00:04:03,233
He cheated on me. I'm not sure
I'm ready to just jump back in.

84
00:04:03,248 --> 00:04:04,430
It's tamale night.

85
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:07,292
Betty, I didn't raise
you to be rude to guests.

86
00:04:07,308 --> 00:04:10,293
Now we saved you some tamales.

87
00:04:10,305 --> 00:04:12,572
Okay. Thank you. I'm starving.

88
00:04:12,588 --> 00:04:14,710
I went to this really
cool work thing tonight,

89
00:04:14,726 --> 00:04:17,001
except it's not
professional to eat, so

90
00:04:17,017 --> 00:04:18,822
I just had a mango margarita.

91
00:04:18,837 --> 00:04:20,121
Here you go.

92
00:04:20,137 --> 00:04:21,053
Hey.

93
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:22,702
Dad, you know what
the doctor said.

94
00:04:22,717 --> 00:04:24,302
You can't have coffee.

95
00:04:24,858 --> 00:04:27,772
Anyway, so I spent the entire
evening just networking

96
00:04:27,787 --> 00:04:30,342
and giving out my
business cards.

97
00:04:30,828 --> 00:04:32,750
- What?
- What? Nothing.

98
00:04:32,765 --> 00:04:35,630
It's just, I find it interesting.
You're drinking now. Okay.

99
00:04:35,645 --> 00:04:37,380
You used to get woozy
from your astringent.

100
00:04:37,397 --> 00:04:39,113
Anyway, it was really fun,

101
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:41,850
and I finally felt
like I belonged.

102
00:04:42,046 --> 00:04:44,370
- You're a legend.
- Me?

103
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:47,160
You saved the Fabia layout
in your first week.

104
00:04:47,177 --> 00:04:49,871
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.
It didn't happen like that.

105
00:04:49,886 --> 00:04:52,933
I've slaved away for years, and I'm
not even trusted to pick out a belt.

106
00:04:52,946 --> 00:04:54,843
What is your secret?

107
00:04:54,855 --> 00:04:58,883
Um... just, uh, doing my job.

108
00:04:59,477 --> 00:05:01,902
And she's modest, too.

109
00:05:02,656 --> 00:05:03,902
What are you drinking?

110
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,323
Um...

111
00:05:05,336 --> 00:05:07,603
uh,  mango margarita?

112
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:11,612
Oh, you should have seen her.
She was so gross.

113
00:05:11,626 --> 00:05:14,281
All she did was talk about
herself the entire night.

114
00:05:14,298 --> 00:05:15,792
Yeah, that doesn't
sound like Betty.

115
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:18,691
Ugh. Well, get a drink in her,
and it is the Betty show.

116
00:05:18,707 --> 00:05:22,332
She would not shut up,
bragging about the Fabia layout.

117
00:05:22,345 --> 00:05:23,541
It was all Daniel's vision.

118
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:26,761
It'd be really wrong for me to
take any credit for the layout.

119
00:05:26,778 --> 00:05:30,661
Wow. An assistant who doesn't
trash-talk their boss.

120
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:34,632
I know.
Trash-talking is what I do best.

121
00:05:34,645 --> 00:05:37,331
Well, second best.

122
00:05:37,348 --> 00:05:39,420
It's really easy when
you have a good boss.

123
00:05:39,437 --> 00:05:41,990
You know, I'm really,
really lucky to work for Daniel.

124
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:45,822
And she was clueless as
to how to handle herself.

125
00:05:45,837 --> 00:05:46,942
Shock. 

126
00:05:46,957 --> 00:05:50,371
You should have seen when she
pulled out her business cards.

127
00:05:50,385 --> 00:05:51,801
I just got 'em today.

128
00:05:51,815 --> 00:05:54,920
I don't usually carry
entire boxes in my purse.

129
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:58,300
Well, not since kleenex came
out with the travel size.

130
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,313
No, they did.

131
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:00,662
Tragic.

132
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,583
They're laughing at you,
Betty, not with you.

133
00:06:03,826 --> 00:06:05,742
Poor cow has no idea
we only invited her

134
00:06:05,755 --> 00:06:07,732
so people could see
she really exists.

135
00:06:07,746 --> 00:06:09,661
She's  like the real
life Snuffleupagus....

136
00:06:09,676 --> 00:06:11,372
- only hairier.
- Marc!

137
00:06:11,387 --> 00:06:14,081
What did you find out
that's useful to me?!

138
00:06:14,105 --> 00:06:16,003
No choice gossip?

139
00:06:16,016 --> 00:06:19,132
No dirt to help me destroy
any lesser magazine?

140
00:06:19,147 --> 00:06:22,582
Uh, I, uh,
I'll do better next time.

141
00:06:25,415 --> 00:06:29,392
Do you know how many curly-haired,
effete sycophants there are

142
00:06:29,407 --> 00:06:31,072
waiting to replace you?

143
00:06:31,085 --> 00:06:33,350
I know.
You have five of them on speed dial.

144
00:06:33,363 --> 00:06:35,415
Don't make me call.

145
00:06:42,378 --> 00:06:45,079
Anyway, it was an
amazing night.

146
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:46,611
Are you gonna eat that?

147
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:49,152
Oh, right. I forgot.

148
00:06:49,168 --> 00:06:52,300
You probably need it
to soak up the booze.

149
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:56,291
You know what?
You'd be perfect for my school project.

150
00:06:56,306 --> 00:06:57,581
What school project?

151
00:06:57,596 --> 00:06:59,351
They gave us an assignment
today to write a paper

152
00:06:59,387 --> 00:07:01,292
about someone whose
job we admire.

153
00:07:01,307 --> 00:07:04,081
We get the whole day off
tomorrow to go observe them.

154
00:07:04,097 --> 00:07:05,592
Can you take me to "Mode"?

155
00:07:05,606 --> 00:07:08,472
Yeah, of course,
if it's okay with your mom.

156
00:07:08,485 --> 00:07:10,772
You know,
the fashion world isn't that great.

157
00:07:10,787 --> 00:07:13,060
It's a bunch of self-serving,
shallow tramps

158
00:07:13,077 --> 00:07:16,441
who starve themselves and backstab
each other for expensive clothes,

159
00:07:16,457 --> 00:07:19,512
no self-respecting person
would be caught dead in.

160
00:07:20,956 --> 00:07:22,840
So can I go?

161
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,651
Well, don't say I
didn't warn you.

162
00:07:34,325 --> 00:07:36,830
Oh, my god. You're a celebrity!

163
00:07:36,848 --> 00:07:39,501
The Meade security
guard knows your name!

164
00:07:40,747 --> 00:07:42,992
Oh, look,
here are some of my friends.

165
00:07:43,008 --> 00:07:45,852
Just because we're sharing an
elevator doesn't mean we're friends.

166
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:49,050
Marc, Amanda,
this is, uh, Justin.

167
00:07:49,605 --> 00:07:52,531
Oh, so that's pregnancy weight.

168
00:07:52,545 --> 00:07:55,232
No, um, he's my nephew.

169
00:07:56,288 --> 00:07:58,302
Oh, my god.

170
00:07:58,317 --> 00:08:01,092
Manolo Blahniks, spring 2004!

171
00:08:04,055 --> 00:08:06,913
Wearing two-year-old shoes.

172
00:08:07,046 --> 00:08:09,431
Even I didn't catch that.

173
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,363
Definitely not your son.

174
00:08:12,087 --> 00:08:13,982
I got nothin'! I hate this.

175
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,432
Don't take it out
on the furniture.

176
00:08:16,447 --> 00:08:19,471
It's late october. I got to shoot
the holiday spread this week...

177
00:08:19,486 --> 00:08:22,081
- It's the tube!
- Shh, Justin!

178
00:08:22,095 --> 00:08:23,270
- Sorry.
- Go sit at my desk.

179
00:08:23,288 --> 00:08:24,332
It's right there.

180
00:08:24,348 --> 00:08:27,670
I went to go get
the tanks--gone!

181
00:08:27,686 --> 00:08:30,511
I went to book
the models-- gone!

182
00:08:30,527 --> 00:08:33,523
I went to gethe burned
out Christmas trees--gone!

183
00:08:33,536 --> 00:08:35,833
"Isabella" took them
all out from under us.

184
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,041
- Calm down.
- How can I calm down

185
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:38,913
when somebody leaked our ideas?

186
00:08:38,928 --> 00:08:42,513
"Isabella" magazine literally
stole our entire feature spread!

187
00:08:42,527 --> 00:08:44,271
Oh, my god.

188
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:46,012
C-Carlo Medina.

189
00:08:46,967 --> 00:08:48,972
He bought me a drink.

192
00:09:03,665 --> 00:09:08,303
"Isabella" magazine is doing
a postapocalyptic Christmas.

193
00:09:08,316 --> 00:09:11,391
They copied our entire concept.

194
00:09:11,405 --> 00:09:13,240
They didn't just copy it.
They took it.

195
00:09:13,258 --> 00:09:16,862
The holiday issue is our biggest
source of ad revenue for the year.

196
00:09:16,878 --> 00:09:18,161
We lose advertisers.

197
00:09:18,178 --> 00:09:20,143
Our circulation
goes in the toilet.

198
00:09:20,155 --> 00:09:24,562
Which is precisely why "Mode"
does not tolerate leaks.

199
00:09:24,575 --> 00:09:27,231
Now I will give the
guilty party one chance

200
00:09:27,246 --> 00:09:29,522
to come forward and confess.

201
00:09:29,797 --> 00:09:35,480
Did any of you speak to
anyone at "Isabella"?

202
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:53,661
Well, then, cowards,
we'll do it the hard way.

203
00:09:53,678 --> 00:09:55,482
Everyone is considered guilty

204
00:09:55,498 --> 00:09:57,332
and will be treated as such

205
00:09:57,345 --> 00:09:59,633
until there's a confession.

206
00:09:59,848 --> 00:10:03,532
But by noon on thursday,
someone's head will roll.

207
00:10:07,645 --> 00:10:10,393
See who entered and
exited the building.

208
00:10:10,406 --> 00:10:14,270
I left Fey's music box on my desk,
and now it's gone.

209
00:10:14,287 --> 00:10:15,792
Investigate  everyone.

210
00:10:15,808 --> 00:10:17,321
You have to find
out who took it.

211
00:10:17,336 --> 00:10:18,863
Why didn't you burn it
with the other things?

212
00:10:18,896 --> 00:10:20,111
I couldn't.

213
00:10:20,126 --> 00:10:21,583
That music box is personal.

214
00:10:21,595 --> 00:10:23,191
But it connects you to Fey.

215
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,820
It could provide a motive.

216
00:10:24,837 --> 00:10:26,812
Who knows about the affair?

217
00:10:26,896 --> 00:10:28,451
No one.

218
00:10:28,865 --> 00:10:31,213
No one but my wife.

219
00:10:31,428 --> 00:10:34,662
We have two days to
conceive and execute

220
00:10:34,678 --> 00:10:36,631
an entirely new concept.

221
00:10:36,647 --> 00:10:39,793
If any of you have any plans,
I need you to cancel 'em.

222
00:10:39,808 --> 00:10:42,362
I want everyone working
together to pull this off.

223
00:10:42,378 --> 00:10:45,510
What Daniel's trying to say is
kiss your loved ones good-bye

224
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:47,821
and expect to come
home to dead pets.

225
00:10:47,838 --> 00:10:48,803
Schmoopy.

226
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,771
Well, what are you waiting for?

227
00:10:56,148 --> 00:11:00,331
You kicked me with your
two-year-old shoes!

228
00:11:03,877 --> 00:11:06,790
Have something to be
nervous about, Carol?

229
00:11:06,965 --> 00:11:09,203
I ate half a bagel.

230
00:11:13,066 --> 00:11:16,373
All three of us talked to Carlo
Medina from "Isabella" last night.

231
00:11:16,386 --> 00:11:18,270
What exactly did you tell him?

232
00:11:18,285 --> 00:11:20,312
Not that much.

233
00:11:20,328 --> 00:11:22,293
So you can tell me,

234
00:11:22,305 --> 00:11:24,233
is Daniel Meade a
complete incompetent

235
00:11:24,245 --> 00:11:27,351
or more like a slow-but-cute
younger brother?

236
00:11:27,366 --> 00:11:28,621
Neither.

237
00:11:28,636 --> 00:11:31,230
Daniel is a lot smarter
than people think he is.

238
00:11:31,245 --> 00:11:34,090
Really? I just find that
so hard to believe.

239
00:11:34,105 --> 00:11:36,450
Okay, well, like thursday,
we have our feature shoot--

240
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:39,410
a postapocalyptic Christmas.
It's really cool.

241
00:11:39,426 --> 00:11:42,981
We rented tanks,
and it was all Daniel's idea. Tanks.

242
00:11:42,997 --> 00:11:44,770
Ooh, Betty. Too bad.
It looks like you're the leak.

243
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,390
Oh, well.
You didn't really fit in here anyway.

244
00:11:46,428 --> 00:11:47,651
- Ta.
- Wait, no!

245
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,121
All I mentioned were tanks.

246
00:11:49,138 --> 00:11:50,710
You guys talked to him, too.

247
00:11:50,726 --> 00:11:54,271
Yeah, what did you
talk to Carlo about?

248
00:11:54,285 --> 00:11:57,721
Okay, first of all,
he talked to me.

249
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,630
To assistants.

250
00:12:04,647 --> 00:12:06,553
What are you doing
here all alone?

251
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:07,742
That's not like you.

252
00:12:07,758 --> 00:12:12,173
I just don't understand it.
She's like Liza at the pride parade.

253
00:12:12,186 --> 00:12:14,193
Betty, Betty, Betty!

254
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,783
Oh, they just want to hear about the
postapocalyptic Christmas spread.

255
00:12:17,795 --> 00:12:19,262
Is she taking credit for that?

256
00:12:19,277 --> 00:12:21,251
Wilhelmina's the one who
found the flak jackets.

257
00:12:21,267 --> 00:12:24,602
There's this hot new designer,
Anh Vu-Tran--

258
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,883
gonna be huge!

259
00:12:26,897 --> 00:12:28,601
You featuring anyone else?

260
00:12:28,616 --> 00:12:31,982
Oh, when you've got the best,

261
00:12:31,995 --> 00:12:34,191
you can forget the rest.

262
00:12:34,207 --> 00:12:36,962
Okay, so we have tanks
and flak jackets.

263
00:12:36,978 --> 00:12:40,762
I'm guessing the cosmo fountain
might have spilled something, too.

264
00:12:40,777 --> 00:12:43,061
I had one drink.

265
00:12:43,077 --> 00:12:45,681
Unlike the two of you,
I was actually trying to figure out

266
00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:47,993
what was going on
at "Isabella."

267
00:12:48,005 --> 00:12:52,131
So what are you guys doing
for your holiday issue?

268
00:12:52,148 --> 00:12:55,183
Oh, the usual--boring.

269
00:12:55,197 --> 00:12:58,280
I'm much more interested
in hearing about you...

270
00:12:58,297 --> 00:12:59,553
and your magazine.

271
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:02,133
Well, since you ask,
"Mode" is using one of my ideas.

272
00:13:02,145 --> 00:13:03,393
Do you know "Planet
of the apes"?

273
00:13:03,425 --> 00:13:05,592
I dressed as Dr.
Zaius one Halloween.

274
00:13:05,606 --> 00:13:07,423
Mm. Well,
we're doing the statue of liberty scene,

275
00:13:07,457 --> 00:13:11,493
but with Santa buried half in the sand,
holding up a new year's baby.

276
00:13:11,508 --> 00:13:14,490
I only know the movie
'cause I dated a geek once.

277
00:13:14,506 --> 00:13:16,702
Maybe you will again.

278
00:13:17,085 --> 00:13:19,101
Buy you another drink?

279
00:13:21,706 --> 00:13:23,250
Yes.

280
00:13:24,018 --> 00:13:25,753
Carlo's straight? 

281
00:13:25,765 --> 00:13:29,542
So I guess this means all three of us
need to go to Wilhelmina and confess.

282
00:13:29,556 --> 00:13:31,120
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

283
00:13:31,155 --> 00:13:33,073
Have you been smoking
one of your ponchos?

284
00:13:33,088 --> 00:13:35,302
There's nothing to confess.
We don't know it was us.

285
00:13:35,318 --> 00:13:36,562
How can you say that?

286
00:13:36,576 --> 00:13:38,942
We told three tiny
parts of a giant shoot.

287
00:13:38,955 --> 00:13:41,070
How'd "Isabella" find out about
the burned out Christmas trees

288
00:13:41,107 --> 00:13:42,842
or the scrap metal reindeer?

289
00:13:42,858 --> 00:13:44,200
That  must have
been someone else.

290
00:13:44,218 --> 00:13:46,880
We have to keep quiet and hope
that the real leaker is found.

291
00:13:46,898 --> 00:13:48,460
No. I can't do that.

292
00:13:48,476 --> 00:13:50,230
Look, I won't say
anything about you guys,

293
00:13:50,307 --> 00:13:52,282
but I need to
confess what I did.

294
00:13:53,688 --> 00:13:55,610
There were only a few people
from "Mode" at the Rack.

295
00:13:55,646 --> 00:13:58,352
If you say the leak happened there,
it'll draw a line straight to us.

296
00:13:58,388 --> 00:14:01,032
Even if it does,
they can't fire all of us.

297
00:14:01,086 --> 00:14:02,162
Can't they?

298
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:03,820
Photo department, 2003--

299
00:14:03,837 --> 00:14:07,312
got axed for mentioning the
words "sepia tones" at a party.

300
00:14:07,476 --> 00:14:11,063
Well, look,
I just--I don't like lying.

301
00:14:11,956 --> 00:14:13,842
Neither do I.

302
00:14:13,858 --> 00:14:17,050
Okay, that's a lie,
but we're just asking you to omit.

303
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:20,220
It's like a secret--
our secret.

304
00:14:20,236 --> 00:14:23,052
Look, you are one
of us now, Betty--

305
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:25,403
the assistants club.

306
00:14:25,415 --> 00:14:28,142
We have to protect each other.

307
00:14:30,915 --> 00:14:35,303
Well, I mean, I guess keeping quiet is
better than getting you guys fired.

308
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:38,032
Then we're agreed?

309
00:14:42,276 --> 00:14:44,291
Yeah, okay.

310
00:14:44,308 --> 00:14:46,563
We're all in this together.

311
00:15:01,175 --> 00:15:03,831
Maybe she's different now,
you know?

312
00:15:03,846 --> 00:15:07,122
Fancy job and drinking...

313
00:15:07,136 --> 00:15:09,652
You cheated on her.

314
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:14,520
I know, I know.
God, why did I do that?

315
00:15:14,535 --> 00:15:16,861
Very, very sorry about that.

316
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,670
It's just--I...

317
00:15:19,968 --> 00:15:23,202
I love her.

318
00:15:25,398 --> 00:15:27,382
I can fix that.

319
00:15:28,626 --> 00:15:31,040
Oh, wait a minute.
You like it in spanish.

320
00:15:32,025 --> 00:15:35,360
Oh, you know, many years ago,

321
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,980
I had a fight with,
um, Betty's mother--

322
00:15:37,996 --> 00:15:39,572
a big one.

323
00:15:39,586 --> 00:15:41,903
She banned me from
our bed for a week.

324
00:15:41,915 --> 00:15:43,673
Ouch.

325
00:15:46,795 --> 00:15:49,293
I knew I had to do
something good.

326
00:15:50,385 --> 00:15:54,162
So I thought of her favorite movie,
"Pretty woman,"

327
00:15:54,307 --> 00:15:57,951
and I stole a page
from Richard Gere.

328
00:15:58,488 --> 00:16:02,560
What do you mean?
Like... you paid her?

329
00:16:02,637 --> 00:16:04,552
No.

330
00:16:04,617 --> 00:16:07,142
I did the scene from the
end of the movie, Walter,

331
00:16:07,155 --> 00:16:11,023
when he climbs up the fire escape
and declares his love for her.

332
00:16:12,786 --> 00:16:16,432
Wait a minute.
That--that's not supposed to happen.

333
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,751
Well...

334
00:16:22,776 --> 00:16:25,783
it worked like a charm.

335
00:16:25,795 --> 00:16:27,433
Yeah, I don't know.

336
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:31,342
I don't know if a big, romantic
gesture will work on the new Betty.

337
00:16:31,355 --> 00:16:32,990
There is no new Betty.

338
00:16:33,005 --> 00:16:34,700
Just new surroundings.

339
00:16:34,717 --> 00:16:37,170
Betty is the same.

340
00:16:38,545 --> 00:16:40,083
I guess you're right.

341
00:16:42,357 --> 00:16:44,033
- Did you do that?
- Uh, no.

342
00:16:44,048 --> 00:16:46,142
That's actually the phone.

343
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:48,621
Hello?

344
00:16:48,637 --> 00:16:51,743
This is Anne Frazier from
mercer park regional H.M.O.

345
00:16:51,758 --> 00:16:54,641
I'm just calling to confirm
your 2:00 appointment.

346
00:16:54,657 --> 00:16:57,060
Actually, uh...
that's a mistake.

347
00:16:57,075 --> 00:16:58,851
Uh, I don't--I don't
need to come in.

348
00:16:58,868 --> 00:16:59,890
Are you sure?

349
00:16:59,906 --> 00:17:02,542
A Betty Suarez called
at least 25 times.

350
00:17:02,557 --> 00:17:04,511
No. It won't be necessary.

351
00:17:04,528 --> 00:17:07,381
Well, it sounded like you have
some pretty legitimate claim.

352
00:17:07,397 --> 00:17:09,372
No. Thank you.

353
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,170
Sorry.

354
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,800
What are you gonna tell him?

355
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:30,390
What are you gonna tell?

356
00:17:30,405 --> 00:17:33,472
You know, we might be better off
not saying anything to Bradford.

357
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:35,591
Mm. You sure that's
a good idea?

358
00:17:35,608 --> 00:17:38,741
Dad's approved every
holiday spread since 1986.

359
00:17:38,755 --> 00:17:42,121
Well, as the top two people here,
we need to protect each other.

360
00:17:42,137 --> 00:17:44,791
And even though it wasn't our
fault that there was a leak,

361
00:17:44,806 --> 00:17:48,430
we'll both be blamed if we
admit it before we have a fix.

362
00:18:02,086 --> 00:18:03,500
Okay.

363
00:18:03,668 --> 00:18:05,331
This will be our secret.

364
00:18:05,345 --> 00:18:07,062
We'll work with each other...

365
00:18:07,077 --> 00:18:08,872
to fix it.

366
00:18:08,885 --> 00:18:10,810
I'll start with the leak.

367
00:18:10,828 --> 00:18:13,192
I'll tackle the new spread.

368
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:14,780
Perfect.

369
00:18:15,367 --> 00:18:17,451
We're in this together.

370
00:18:19,036 --> 00:18:21,270
Are you as creeped out as I am?

371
00:18:21,285 --> 00:18:22,911
More.

372
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:26,660
Oh, there you are.

373
00:18:26,676 --> 00:18:27,770
Here I am.

374
00:18:27,785 --> 00:18:30,570
I want you to call the agency.
Tell them the concept is changing.

375
00:18:30,585 --> 00:18:33,532
I want you to get the wardrobe we
rejected, and I want to see it again.

376
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:36,891
Dig up the back holiday issues
of for the last 50 years,

377
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:39,661
photocopy the feature spreads,
distribute them to the editors.

378
00:18:39,676 --> 00:18:40,822
Do you work here?

379
00:18:40,836 --> 00:18:42,491
Someday.

380
00:18:42,506 --> 00:18:44,800
This is my nephew.
Um, he's just doing a school--

381
00:18:44,816 --> 00:18:45,822
- Amanda.
- Yes?

382
00:18:45,837 --> 00:18:47,392
We need you to get
snacks and water.

383
00:18:47,405 --> 00:18:49,502
Flat and sparkling, 
half cold, half room temp,

384
00:18:49,517 --> 00:18:51,362
and when you get back with those,
we'll need to get lunches

385
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:53,173
because no one is
leaving this building.

386
00:18:53,187 --> 00:18:54,421
But who's gonna
answer the phones?

387
00:18:54,457 --> 00:18:55,941
Get an intern.

388
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,100
Please, let it be
Narciso Rodriguez.

389
00:18:58,116 --> 00:18:59,462
Daniel Meade's office.

390
00:18:59,475 --> 00:19:01,952
Daniel Meade, please.

391
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:03,012
It's  her.

392
00:19:03,027 --> 00:19:07,011
I told her I'm not taking her
calls till she tells me who she is.

393
00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:09,151
I'm sorry,
unless I can say who's calling,

394
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,931
I'm gonna have to
take a message.

395
00:19:10,947 --> 00:19:12,603
Oh, well, then

396
00:19:12,705 --> 00:19:16,941
tell Daniel we both know his
father's been acting very strangely.

397
00:19:16,957 --> 00:19:18,931
He's a man of many secrets,

398
00:19:18,947 --> 00:19:21,973
and one of them is
in the music box.

399
00:19:21,988 --> 00:19:25,041
"In the music box"?
I have no idea what that means.

400
00:19:25,057 --> 00:19:27,462
It'll come to you, dear.

401
00:19:32,665 --> 00:19:37,732
So tell me who you
know at "Isabella."

402
00:19:44,718 --> 00:19:46,922
You don't have any reindeer?

403
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,813
What about a big goat?

404
00:19:48,825 --> 00:19:50,891
Wait hold on.
I have another line.

405
00:19:55,186 --> 00:19:56,253
Hello?

406
00:19:56,265 --> 00:19:58,483
Styles just came out.
They still have jobs.

407
00:19:58,496 --> 00:20:00,210
- That's good.
- That's horrendous.

408
00:20:00,228 --> 00:20:02,180
But features goes in at noon.

409
00:20:02,196 --> 00:20:03,862
Pray.

410
00:20:19,437 --> 00:20:20,340
Hello?

411
00:20:20,356 --> 00:20:24,260
Features went in at 12:00,
came out at 12:20.

412
00:20:24,276 --> 00:20:26,180
They're still employed.

413
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,580
Hello?

414
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:45,322
Oh. One second.

415
00:20:46,485 --> 00:20:48,392
- Marc?
- Photo editors cleared.

416
00:20:48,405 --> 00:20:51,921
Accessories cleared.
Art department cleared.

417
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:54,662
Well, how many
departments are left?

418
00:20:54,678 --> 00:20:56,281
Beauty and accounting.

419
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:59,140
Well, you know those virgins
in accounting didn't do it.

420
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:02,862
We'll hope the
sluts in beauty did.

421
00:21:03,007 --> 00:21:04,690
Good luck.

422
00:21:08,316 --> 00:21:11,130
I want to strangle
that filthy rat

423
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:13,580
- that leaked the spread.
- This dress is fabulous.

424
00:21:13,597 --> 00:21:15,301
I bet it was that bitch,
skinny Carol.

425
00:21:15,318 --> 00:21:16,772
I think I'd belt it.

426
00:21:16,786 --> 00:21:18,580
That, young man,
is vintage Valentino.

427
00:21:18,596 --> 00:21:21,022
- I'm just saying.
- Really? Do you think?

428
00:21:21,036 --> 00:21:22,720
Go on then.
Go on to the accessory closet.

429
00:21:22,735 --> 00:21:24,593
Get a belt,
and we'll see what it looks like. Go on.

430
00:21:24,627 --> 00:21:26,393
Wait. Hurry back.
We gotta go get dinners.

431
00:21:26,407 --> 00:21:28,583
Oh, leave him here.
He's having fun. He's all right.

432
00:21:28,596 --> 00:21:29,330
Really?

433
00:21:29,345 --> 00:21:32,153
Yeah. Besides, I got some elf
costumes I need to fit later on,

434
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,281
and little people sort
of make me nervous.

435
00:21:34,298 --> 00:21:35,530
Well, thank you.

436
00:21:35,548 --> 00:21:37,860
Okay. No.

437
00:21:48,048 --> 00:21:49,460
Betty.

438
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:50,953
Me?

439
00:21:50,965 --> 00:21:52,912
Could I have a moment, please?

440
00:21:52,926 --> 00:21:55,233
Um, did I do something wrong?

441
00:21:55,248 --> 00:21:59,052
Daniel's been receiving nuisance
phone calls from a strange woman.

442
00:21:59,066 --> 00:22:00,463
I assume you listen in?

443
00:22:00,478 --> 00:22:02,211
Yes, sir. Um...

444
00:22:02,228 --> 00:22:04,542
she wouldn't tell
us who she is.

445
00:22:04,555 --> 00:22:07,452
Well, we think she might be a designer
we fired a couple of years ago.

446
00:22:07,465 --> 00:22:09,921
She threatens to sue
from time to time.

447
00:22:09,938 --> 00:22:11,390
Has she called recently?

448
00:22:11,406 --> 00:22:13,272
Yes, yes,
this morning actually.

449
00:22:13,285 --> 00:22:15,643
Um... it didn't
make much sense.

450
00:22:15,658 --> 00:22:17,853
Still, I'd like to know exactly

451
00:22:17,868 --> 00:22:21,221
what she said for
certain legal reasons.

452
00:22:21,648 --> 00:22:25,013
Uh, well, she said that, uh,
you've been acting very strangely,

453
00:22:25,025 --> 00:22:29,472
and you have many secrets,
and one of them is in the music box.

454
00:22:29,486 --> 00:22:31,390
Music box?

455
00:22:31,406 --> 00:22:34,041
Did she say where this
music box might be?

456
00:22:34,055 --> 00:22:35,540
No. I-I asked her.

457
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:38,932
Um... she wouldn't say anything.
She's not very forthcoming.

458
00:22:38,946 --> 00:22:42,713
Well, she's certainly
intent on wasting our time.

459
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:52,262
Excuse me!

460
00:22:53,945 --> 00:22:55,870
Wilhelmina's dinner.

461
00:22:55,888 --> 00:22:57,491
Beauty cleared.

462
00:22:57,505 --> 00:22:58,770
What are we supposed to do?

463
00:22:58,785 --> 00:23:01,251
That depends.
Did you hit the powerball last night?

464
00:23:01,268 --> 00:23:03,571
- No.
- Then keep quiet.

465
00:23:03,585 --> 00:23:05,121
Hey!

466
00:23:05,138 --> 00:23:06,801
It's not yours.

467
00:23:07,105 --> 00:23:08,472
Here's your dinner.

468
00:23:08,486 --> 00:23:10,733
- You must be starving.
- Thanks.

469
00:23:10,746 --> 00:23:12,320
You know what?
You can take off.

470
00:23:12,336 --> 00:23:15,103
I'm sure your nephew is sick
of the closet by now anyway.

471
00:23:16,585 --> 00:23:18,621
You worked hard today.

472
00:23:19,896 --> 00:23:21,683
Okay.

473
00:23:22,847 --> 00:23:25,340
You know what, Daniel?
I have something to say.

474
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:28,171
The night before the leak,
I was at the Rack,

475
00:23:28,187 --> 00:23:30,040
and I was talking to a
guy from "Isabella"--

476
00:23:30,055 --> 00:23:31,640
You know what, Betty?

477
00:23:31,656 --> 00:23:34,942
I don't really have time to
hear about this right now.

478
00:23:34,957 --> 00:23:37,693
You told me not to hide
things from you, Daniel.

479
00:23:38,495 --> 00:23:39,960
Listen to me.

480
00:23:39,977 --> 00:23:42,510
I don't have to know
about everything.

481
00:23:42,528 --> 00:23:46,893
Especially if knowing about it
means I'd end up losing you.

482
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:52,022
So... have a great night.

483
00:24:02,905 --> 00:24:06,951
I got your favorite
salad--endive and arugula.

484
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:10,623
No dressing,
but I did get a few extra lemon slices

485
00:24:10,637 --> 00:24:13,603
because, well,
you've earned them.

486
00:24:13,615 --> 00:24:15,103
Is that frisée?

487
00:24:15,118 --> 00:24:16,693
No, no.

488
00:24:19,488 --> 00:24:21,151
They were?

489
00:24:22,437 --> 00:24:25,393
You'll notice I ripped your
lettuce into bite-sized pieces

490
00:24:25,407 --> 00:24:27,843
and decobbed your baby corn.

491
00:24:28,116 --> 00:24:29,872
Interesting.

492
00:24:30,576 --> 00:24:32,010
Thank you.

493
00:24:34,198 --> 00:24:37,910
Was Carlo Medina from "Isabella"
at the Rack last night?

494
00:24:37,926 --> 00:24:39,502
Hmm?

495
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,512
There's also a product closet,

496
00:24:59,526 --> 00:25:02,532
like, with moisturizers
and hair balms

497
00:25:02,546 --> 00:25:04,283
and there's ten
different kinds of--

498
00:25:04,297 --> 00:25:08,331
Justin, why don't you put all
of that stuff in your paper?

499
00:25:08,345 --> 00:25:09,893
Fine.

500
00:25:12,275 --> 00:25:14,661
Is somebody gonna get that?

501
00:25:16,286 --> 00:25:18,230
I guess not.

502
00:25:21,606 --> 00:25:25,151
Ew. Wilhelmina wants to
see us at 10:00 tomorrow.

503
00:25:25,665 --> 00:25:27,621
She knows.

504
00:25:42,555 --> 00:25:46,203
Oh, my god.
I have that same Jesus night-light.

505
00:25:46,786 --> 00:25:50,653
So this is very...
flea market chic.

506
00:25:50,668 --> 00:25:53,640
Ah, these must be your friends from,
uh, "The Mode."

507
00:25:53,658 --> 00:25:55,260
Just "Mode," dad.

508
00:25:55,275 --> 00:25:58,913
Um, this is my father
Ignacio and my sister Hilda.

509
00:25:58,927 --> 00:26:00,811
Ho-la.

510
00:26:01,007 --> 00:26:03,523
It's, uh, "hola."

511
00:26:03,536 --> 00:26:04,432
No.

512
00:26:04,447 --> 00:26:06,033
There's an "h" in it.

513
00:26:06,048 --> 00:26:07,333
Betty?

514
00:26:07,348 --> 00:26:11,213
This lotion is made from
crushed diamonds and...

515
00:26:11,225 --> 00:26:13,943
Hey, guys.
I didn't know you were here.

516
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:15,650
Nice. You stole the good stuff.

517
00:26:15,668 --> 00:26:16,980
Justin.

518
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:18,603
Homework.

519
00:26:23,036 --> 00:26:26,052
Oh, um...
Amanda, those are plastic.

520
00:26:26,068 --> 00:26:27,130
Ew.

521
00:26:27,148 --> 00:26:30,041
Betty, maybe we should
offer your friends a snack.

522
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:31,411
We have flan.

523
00:26:31,427 --> 00:26:32,981
What's a flan?

524
00:26:32,996 --> 00:26:34,860
It's a delicious custard.

525
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:36,932
Oh, bring it.

526
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:53,641
How about a "Lawrence
of Arabia" Christmas?

527
00:26:53,657 --> 00:26:55,243
I don't even know
what that means.

528
00:26:55,256 --> 00:27:00,902
It means that we can use the 21 tons
of sand that are already there.

529
00:27:06,528 --> 00:27:11,712
Okay. All right.
Off that, the sand...

530
00:27:11,775 --> 00:27:15,491
is desert sand like Africa,
so maybe instead of Christmas,

531
00:27:15,505 --> 00:27:17,993
we do other winter
holidays. Kwanzaa?

532
00:27:18,007 --> 00:27:20,062
Did you just gesture at
me when you said Kwanzaa?

533
00:27:20,075 --> 00:27:21,431
No.

534
00:27:31,825 --> 00:27:33,713
How about this?

535
00:27:34,295 --> 00:27:36,113
Fey's sleigh ride--

536
00:27:36,127 --> 00:27:39,071
the biggest-selling holiday
issue in the history of "Mode."

537
00:27:39,087 --> 00:27:40,561
1986.

538
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,141
Yeah, I know it well.

539
00:27:42,155 --> 00:27:43,721
Let me see that.

540
00:27:47,075 --> 00:27:49,403
It's traditional. I like it.

541
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,053
Old is the new new.

542
00:27:51,068 --> 00:27:53,962
When Fey put herself in the photo,
it sent shock waves.

543
00:27:53,978 --> 00:27:56,581
No editor ever appeared
in the center spread.

544
00:27:56,598 --> 00:27:58,861
I think in the
year of her death,

545
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:02,502
an empty sleigh would
be a nice tribute.

546
00:28:06,745 --> 00:28:08,683
What do you think?

547
00:28:08,876 --> 00:28:10,393
Yeah.

548
00:28:10,547 --> 00:28:12,773
Let's do it.

549
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,773
We're pinning it on Fat Carol.

550
00:28:15,785 --> 00:28:16,382
What?

551
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:18,373
Well, we have to say something
when Wilhelmina calls us in.

552
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:20,733
Marc, that's not fair.
She didn't do anything.

553
00:28:20,748 --> 00:28:22,602
You know she calls you
"Fat Betty," right?

554
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:25,191
See? This is why I hate secrets
because they turn into lies,

555
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:26,282
which are much worse.

556
00:28:26,296 --> 00:28:27,561
Fat Carol hates her job.

557
00:28:27,575 --> 00:28:30,240
Would she eat so many
grilled cheeses if she cared?

558
00:28:30,255 --> 00:28:31,953
Betty, we're doing
this for you.

559
00:28:31,967 --> 00:28:34,081
We could get other jobs, but

560
00:28:34,097 --> 00:28:36,293
look how long it took
you to land this one.

561
00:28:36,307 --> 00:28:38,371
Well, I just didn't realize
that keeping so many secrets

562
00:28:38,408 --> 00:28:41,032
was such a big part of
my job description.

563
00:28:41,257 --> 00:28:43,043
Betty...

564
00:28:44,527 --> 00:28:47,673
do you have another
pan of this stuff?

565
00:28:53,475 --> 00:28:55,703
You're disgusting.

566
00:28:58,257 --> 00:29:01,103
Healthy appetite that girl has.

567
00:29:01,927 --> 00:29:04,491
Don't tell her we
have ice cream.

568
00:29:10,547 --> 00:29:12,311
You know, Betty...

569
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:15,240
sometimes...

570
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:18,313
we have to keep
secrets to survive.

571
00:29:34,618 --> 00:29:35,943
Hold it!

572
00:29:42,226 --> 00:29:45,270
You know, it's too bad about
your Wilhelmina meeting.

573
00:29:45,566 --> 00:29:47,941
We'll miss you around here.

574
00:29:48,755 --> 00:29:51,013
Shut up, Carol.

575
00:29:51,028 --> 00:29:55,863
I don't know if there's rehab for...
whatever this is,

576
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,731
but consider it before
starting the job hunt.

577
00:29:58,747 --> 00:30:02,892
And, Betty,
I think I might miss you most of all.

578
00:30:03,537 --> 00:30:06,092
It was nice having
someone Fatter than me.

579
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:09,301
Fat Carol.

580
00:30:09,638 --> 00:30:11,292
Fat Carol.

581
00:30:12,906 --> 00:30:14,752
Fat Carol.

582
00:30:18,785 --> 00:30:21,060
Good morning, Daniel.
Here's your coffee.

583
00:30:21,077 --> 00:30:23,823
I didn't realize you were
gonna come in so early.

584
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,423
Where'd you get that?

585
00:30:29,438 --> 00:30:32,600
Are you okay?
Do you need me to get you something?

586
00:30:35,336 --> 00:30:37,462
When I was 12,

587
00:30:37,806 --> 00:30:39,930
I had the worst
Christmas of my life.

588
00:30:39,945 --> 00:30:41,492
My, uh...

589
00:30:41,595 --> 00:30:44,162
father had just gotten
back from Switzerland,

590
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,852
brought my mom... a music box.

591
00:30:46,866 --> 00:30:48,770
Exactly like this.

592
00:30:48,787 --> 00:30:50,791
She loved it.

593
00:30:50,847 --> 00:30:55,553
A few days later,
she hid the thing in the attic...

594
00:30:57,756 --> 00:31:02,673
set fire to a thousand
copies of "Mode" magazine.

595
00:31:02,807 --> 00:31:05,551
No one would ever tell me why.

596
00:31:05,565 --> 00:31:07,823
So is this your mother's?

597
00:31:07,836 --> 00:31:11,392
No. This...
appeared here this morning.

598
00:31:11,406 --> 00:31:13,840
Apparently my father
bought two of them--

599
00:31:13,856 --> 00:31:16,070
one for his wife

600
00:31:16,085 --> 00:31:18,923
and, uh, one...

601
00:31:23,367 --> 00:31:25,470
For his mistress.

602
00:31:27,058 --> 00:31:30,701
That's why Fey put herself
in the feature spread.

603
00:31:31,035 --> 00:31:34,341
She was flaunting the
affair in my mother's face.

604
00:31:34,357 --> 00:31:36,750
I'm sorry, Daniel.

605
00:31:37,886 --> 00:31:40,501
Was there anything inside?

606
00:31:42,598 --> 00:31:44,980
You know, the top lifts out.

607
00:31:55,595 --> 00:31:59,081
This woman is trying to connect
your father to Fey Sommers.

608
00:31:59,095 --> 00:32:00,391
She's trying to do
more than that, Betty.

609
00:32:00,426 --> 00:32:03,852
She's trying to connect
my dad to Fey's death.

610
00:32:05,656 --> 00:32:07,202
I just got back
from the studio.

611
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:09,521
There's still 21 tons
of sand sitting there.

612
00:32:09,537 --> 00:32:11,251
Maybe I should just go
to the paramus mall

613
00:32:11,267 --> 00:32:13,931
and take pictures
of kids with Santa.

614
00:32:15,887 --> 00:32:18,960
No. I know what we
can do with that sand.

615
00:32:18,976 --> 00:32:21,051
Follow me to the art department.
Come on.

616
00:32:21,068 --> 00:32:22,922
Wait. Daniel?

617
00:32:23,015 --> 00:32:24,872
You should probably know
that I have a meeting

618
00:32:24,887 --> 00:32:27,490
with Wilhelmina
in five minutes.

619
00:32:28,357 --> 00:32:30,551
Really? You?

620
00:32:30,566 --> 00:32:33,512
Yeah, me and--and
Amanda and Marc.

621
00:32:33,526 --> 00:32:35,640
You sure you know
what you're doing?

622
00:32:35,658 --> 00:32:37,312
Not a clue.

623
00:32:37,328 --> 00:32:39,381
Just be careful what you say.

624
00:32:45,158 --> 00:32:47,182
Justin, what are
you doing here?

625
00:32:47,197 --> 00:32:49,732
I have to do some more
research for my paper.

626
00:32:49,747 --> 00:32:51,910
Sit down. Thank you, Marc.

627
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:54,923
Daniel Meade's office.

628
00:32:54,935 --> 00:32:57,622
Justin's school just called.
He's not there. Is he with you?

629
00:32:57,638 --> 00:32:59,373
Yeah, he's--he's right here.

630
00:32:59,388 --> 00:33:00,800
I'm gonna kill him.

631
00:33:00,817 --> 00:33:02,713
I knew this would happen.

632
00:33:02,727 --> 00:33:05,180
The fashion world is no
place for a boy his age.

633
00:33:05,197 --> 00:33:07,491
Well, he said he has to do
more work for his paper.

634
00:33:07,507 --> 00:33:10,253
Wake up, Betty.
There is no paper.

635
00:33:10,265 --> 00:33:11,242
What?

636
00:33:11,257 --> 00:33:13,911
Yeah, he made the whe thing up
so he could just ditch school

637
00:33:13,928 --> 00:33:15,902
and spend time in your world.

638
00:33:15,917 --> 00:33:17,192
Well, I didn't know.

639
00:33:17,205 --> 00:33:18,562
I don't even know
how to deal with it.

640
00:33:18,598 --> 00:33:20,942
I don't--I don't know what
I'm gonna do with that boy.

641
00:33:20,955 --> 00:33:25,403
You tell him that he is in
big trouble when he gets home.

642
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:30,440
So... you're ditching?

643
00:33:30,456 --> 00:33:33,371
It's not a big deal.
I'm missing P.E. and art.

644
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,840
We're sketching fruit.

645
00:33:34,855 --> 00:33:36,493
That's not the point.

646
00:33:36,507 --> 00:33:39,901
Justin, this place that you
think is so glamorous...

647
00:33:39,918 --> 00:33:42,003
it's not all it's
cracked up to be.

648
00:33:42,016 --> 00:33:45,921
It's people deceiving each other and...
hiding things

649
00:33:45,936 --> 00:33:50,482
and all kinds of stuff that's
not good for a kid to be around.

650
00:33:50,497 --> 00:33:53,150
Someday, maybe you'll end up
working in a place like this,

651
00:33:53,168 --> 00:33:56,773
but you're not gonna get
very far in life by lying.

652
00:33:57,567 --> 00:34:00,181
That is not who we are.

653
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:04,213
Showtime.

654
00:34:07,987 --> 00:34:10,882
Stay here and don't move.

655
00:34:14,737 --> 00:34:19,173
Shall I ask questions, or do you
want to just tell me what you know?

656
00:34:19,187 --> 00:34:22,701
Well, we were all at the
Rack on tuesday night,

657
00:34:22,715 --> 00:34:27,441
and we just realized that
we all saw the same thing--

658
00:34:27,457 --> 00:34:30,431
someone talking to Carlo
Medina from "Isabella."

659
00:34:30,446 --> 00:34:34,402
Now as much as it hurts
us to rat out a friend,

660
00:34:34,415 --> 00:34:36,241
we have to tell you.

661
00:34:36,278 --> 00:34:38,242
It was Fat Carol.

662
00:34:38,257 --> 00:34:39,750
I saw her, too.

663
00:34:39,768 --> 00:34:42,763
Fat Carol leaked the spread.

664
00:34:44,275 --> 00:34:46,112
Betty?

665
00:34:46,677 --> 00:34:49,330
Is that what you saw?

666
00:34:56,238 --> 00:34:57,862
No.

667
00:34:58,628 --> 00:35:00,451
It was me.

668
00:35:04,255 --> 00:35:06,831
I told Carlo everything.

669
00:35:18,835 --> 00:35:20,550
You can go.

670
00:35:21,446 --> 00:35:23,041
What?!

671
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:25,130
Aren't you gonna fire her?

672
00:35:25,145 --> 00:35:28,401
If I fire her, Amanda,
I'd have to fire all of you.

673
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,861
You're not the only
one with informants.

674
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:33,032
I know exactly what happened.

675
00:35:33,045 --> 00:35:35,893
The three of you might have
leaked a portion of the spread,

676
00:35:35,907 --> 00:35:39,111
but that disgusting Fat Carol

677
00:35:39,127 --> 00:35:40,740
slept with Carlo

678
00:35:40,757 --> 00:35:42,900
and spilled everything.

679
00:35:42,918 --> 00:35:45,632
- He slept with Fat Carol?!
- He slept with Fat Carol?!

680
00:35:45,647 --> 00:35:48,470
He did what he had to
do for his magazine.

681
00:35:48,485 --> 00:35:50,893
So what happens now?

682
00:35:50,908 --> 00:35:54,802
Well, I'll consider
the last day and a half your punishment.

683
00:35:54,948 --> 00:35:59,743
You were drunk, you were horny
and you were... naive.

684
00:36:01,007 --> 00:36:03,620
Fat Carol on the other hand,

685
00:36:03,637 --> 00:36:05,801
gave it up intentionally.

686
00:36:05,815 --> 00:36:08,373
She gets the axe.

687
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:12,002
Now go before I change my mind.

688
00:36:12,016 --> 00:36:13,740
Go!

689
00:36:24,285 --> 00:36:27,163
It's Christmas in october.

690
00:36:28,677 --> 00:36:30,372
Oh, my god!

691
00:36:30,385 --> 00:36:33,591
It's just like "Top Model,"
except no one's crying.

692
00:36:34,255 --> 00:36:36,531
Justin, go sit in that chair
and don't talk to anybody

693
00:36:36,546 --> 00:36:38,620
unless they talk to you first.

694
00:36:38,638 --> 00:36:40,623
So Wilhelmina told
me what happened.

695
00:36:40,637 --> 00:36:43,703
Daniel, I'm sorry...
for everything.

696
00:36:43,718 --> 00:36:46,502
You know,
it's okay to hide things sometimes,

697
00:36:46,516 --> 00:36:49,753
especially if not hiding
them means I might lose you.

698
00:36:51,295 --> 00:36:53,193
Here.

699
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:55,023
Shoo.

700
00:36:58,596 --> 00:37:01,031
- Nice vest.
- Ralph Lauren.

701
00:37:01,046 --> 00:37:03,170
We got it half-price because
there's a small hole,

702
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:04,410
but you can't even see it.

703
00:37:04,428 --> 00:37:07,142
So... kids at school--

704
00:37:07,156 --> 00:37:08,282
they like it?

705
00:37:08,295 --> 00:37:11,250
No. They don't really get me.

706
00:37:12,305 --> 00:37:14,100
Word of advice--

707
00:37:14,178 --> 00:37:17,473
be who you are,
wear what you want,

708
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:20,303
just learn how to
run real fast.

709
00:37:20,735 --> 00:37:23,550
All right, everyone.
Let's go, Marc!

710
00:37:25,398 --> 00:37:28,612
We need to shoot in five.
Step it up, people.

711
00:37:28,628 --> 00:37:30,382
Hold it.

712
00:37:30,396 --> 00:37:33,092
This isn't the
concept I approved.

713
00:37:33,105 --> 00:37:38,423
I've had final say on every holiday
spread for the last 20 years.

714
00:37:38,438 --> 00:37:41,442
Some things came up last minute
that couldn't be avoided.

715
00:37:41,455 --> 00:37:43,550
Our job is to fix the
problem, Bradford,

716
00:37:43,567 --> 00:37:45,611
not to burden you with it.

717
00:37:45,627 --> 00:37:48,640
You two are so full of crap.

718
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,511
Lucky for you,
it looks quite good--

719
00:37:52,525 --> 00:37:55,202
maybe even better than Fey's.

720
00:37:55,215 --> 00:37:58,173
- Okay, uh, let's--
- Hold on.

721
00:37:58,525 --> 00:38:01,453
You know,
there's one thing missing.

722
00:38:14,765 --> 00:38:16,893
Where did you find that?

723
00:38:17,206 --> 00:38:19,100
The attic.

724
00:38:19,116 --> 00:38:21,372
I remembered mom had it.

725
00:38:22,528 --> 00:38:25,903
Looks just like the one Fey had,
don't you think?

726
00:38:28,966 --> 00:38:32,563
Yes. Almost identical.

727
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:35,240
Good job, son.

728
00:38:35,257 --> 00:38:38,961
Okay. Can we get
this thing going?

729
00:38:38,975 --> 00:38:43,681
My hair is gray, and I'm driving to the
early bird special with my blinkers on.

730
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:45,952
What about the sand?
Isn't that from the old shoot?

731
00:38:45,965 --> 00:38:47,923
Justin.

732
00:38:48,226 --> 00:38:50,450
Say "snow."

733
00:38:52,407 --> 00:38:54,551
Snow.

734
00:39:00,526 --> 00:39:03,653
Snow is a magical blanket.

735
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:08,673
It hides what's ugly and
makes everything beautiful.

736
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:25,222
I'm sorry,
but your father's not who he says he is.

737
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:27,011
I don't know what
you're talking about.

738
00:39:27,026 --> 00:39:28,772
According to our records,

739
00:39:28,786 --> 00:39:32,803
Ignacio Suarez is
117 years old...

740
00:39:32,815 --> 00:39:34,001
and dead.

741
00:39:34,018 --> 00:39:36,313
Well, obviously
that's a mistake.

742
00:39:36,328 --> 00:39:37,752
Not on our end.

743
00:39:37,768 --> 00:39:40,661
The social security number
your father's been using

744
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:43,713
belongs to somebody else.

745
00:39:47,006 --> 00:39:49,472
Suspicions have been raised.

746
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:53,443
father and son are being
driven further apart.

747
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:55,813
We couldn't have
planned it any better.

748
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,583
Wilhelmina Slater.

749
00:40:02,938 --> 00:40:04,800
Carlo Medina.

750
00:40:04,815 --> 00:40:07,900
It is an honor to finally
meet the legend in person.

751
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:11,380
I see I should add shameless
suck-up to the list.

752
00:40:11,398 --> 00:40:12,583
What list is that?

753
00:40:12,595 --> 00:40:17,021
I asked you here to tell you
you are an underhanded bastard,

754
00:40:17,035 --> 00:40:19,702
a despicable, slimy weasel.

755
00:40:19,718 --> 00:40:21,623
You have no moral compass,

756
00:40:21,637 --> 00:40:25,171
are utterly without scruples
and will use anyone in your path

757
00:40:25,185 --> 00:40:27,100
to get what you want.

758
00:40:27,867 --> 00:40:30,791
How can I entice you
to work at "Mode"?

759
00:40:30,807 --> 00:40:34,253
Or rather spy for "Mode"?

760
00:40:35,646 --> 00:40:39,163
And I want you home
by 4:00 every day.

761
00:40:39,175 --> 00:40:42,133
And no TV for a week.

762
00:40:42,147 --> 00:40:46,240
And no "Fashion
TV" for a month.

763
00:40:46,255 --> 00:40:49,290
Isn't any of this
upsetting you?

764
00:40:49,728 --> 00:40:51,632
It was worth it.

765
00:40:51,646 --> 00:40:53,312
Oh, "it was worth it."

766
00:40:53,327 --> 00:40:55,353
Thank you.

767
00:40:58,425 --> 00:41:00,051
Hey, mija.

768
00:41:00,407 --> 00:41:01,800
How was your day?

769
00:41:01,818 --> 00:41:03,793
It was a rough one.

770
00:41:06,206 --> 00:41:09,481
Maybe a little cheese
and jalapeño will help.

771
00:41:10,137 --> 00:41:12,403
It's good.

772
00:41:12,707 --> 00:41:15,663
I think I'm just
gonna go to sleep.

773
00:41:15,745 --> 00:41:17,753
Good night.

774
00:41:17,857 --> 00:41:20,672
# Tale as old as time #

775
00:41:20,688 --> 00:41:23,572
# True as it can be #
What the hell is that?

776
00:41:23,587 --> 00:41:25,690
# Barely even friends #

777
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:28,421
# Then somebody bends #

778
00:41:28,437 --> 00:41:30,942
# Unexpectedly #

779
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:33,661
# Just a little change #

780
00:41:33,766 --> 00:41:37,061
# Small to say the least #

781
00:41:37,075 --> 00:41:39,142
# Both a little scared #

782
00:41:39,155 --> 00:41:41,770
# Neither one prepared #

783
00:41:41,788 --> 00:41:45,102
# Beauty and the beast #

784
00:41:45,118 --> 00:41:47,410
Betty's favorite movie.

785
00:41:47,575 --> 00:41:51,660
# Tale as old as time #

786
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:55,730
# Tune as old as song #

787
00:41:55,887 --> 00:41:58,193
# Bittersweet and strange #

788
00:41:58,206 --> 00:42:01,080
# Finding you can change #

789
00:42:01,098 --> 00:42:04,673
# Learning you were wrong #

790
00:42:05,137 --> 00:42:08,260
# Beauty and the beast #
