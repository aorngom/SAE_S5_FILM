1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,773
Previously on "Ugly Betty"...

2
00:00:01,873 --> 00:00:02,811
I love you, Hilda,

3
00:00:02,911 --> 00:00:04,543
and I want you to be my wife.

4
00:00:05,557 --> 00:00:08,304
Any preference for how we
make your old man disappear?

5
00:00:08,404 --> 00:00:10,263
In six months,
you'll be running Meade Publications.

6
00:00:10,293 --> 00:00:11,203
That's the idea.

7
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:13,446
I'm divorcing Claire.

8
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:16,673
You slut.
Stay away from my husband!

9
00:00:16,773 --> 00:00:19,091
- I'm so sorry.
- I love you.

10
00:00:19,195 --> 00:00:23,010
He's my boyfriend,
so back off, Betty!

11
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,898
I'm gonna fight for Henry.

12
00:00:24,996 --> 00:00:26,946
- You're not the only one in charge.
- But I am the only one

13
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:29,434
with pupils that aren't
the size of quarters.

14
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:32,612
I left my wallet in the bedroom.
Just a second.

15
00:00:32,715 --> 00:00:33,801
Hey, what the--

16
00:00:34,008 --> 00:00:35,280
I won't be going home with you.

17
00:00:35,387 --> 00:00:36,100
What?

18
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:37,651
They denied my visa.

19
00:00:46,965 --> 00:00:49,651
Henry. Hi, it's me.

20
00:00:49,757 --> 00:00:51,440
Uh, Betty. Sorry.

21
00:00:51,547 --> 00:00:53,752
Uh, I never know at what point
you can just say "it's me,"

22
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:55,263
and the other person
knows who it is.

23
00:00:55,337 --> 00:01:01,621
Anyhow, um, I'm back from Mexico,
and I really need to, uh, talk to you.

24
00:01:01,726 --> 00:01:04,183
So just, uh,
give me a "ringle."

25
00:01:04,288 --> 00:01:07,113
I mean, a "jing." Um, I'm sorry.
I'm combining "jingle" and "ring."

26
00:01:07,216 --> 00:01:09,233
Just call me. Thanks.

27
00:01:09,847 --> 00:01:11,063
Learn to talk!

28
00:01:11,925 --> 00:01:13,300
- Hey!
- Hey!

29
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,070
How's Dora the Explorer, huh?
Your trip good?

30
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,061
Everything work out with
your father's citizenship?

31
00:01:18,097 --> 00:01:20,723
Actually, there were some problems.
He's still in Mexico.

32
00:01:20,828 --> 00:01:23,712
But everything's gonna be okay. We
just spoke to the lawyer this morning,

33
00:01:23,748 --> 00:01:25,132
and he'll be home soon.

34
00:01:25,237 --> 00:01:27,150
Hey, I brought you something.

35
00:01:28,277 --> 00:01:30,712
Oh, Betty, you shouldn't have.

36
00:01:30,816 --> 00:01:32,701
Oh, I didn't.
This is for Henry.

37
00:01:32,806 --> 00:01:34,620
- Lucky guy.
- This...

38
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:36,120
is for you.

39
00:01:36,675 --> 00:01:38,822
A rock? Wow.

40
00:01:38,928 --> 00:01:40,462
It's supposed to be mystical.

41
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:42,922
The old man who sold it to
me said it will help you

42
00:01:43,027 --> 00:01:44,872
on your journey
of enlightenment...

43
00:01:44,978 --> 00:01:47,352
or with cramps.
My spanish really sucks.

44
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:49,583
Anyway, I just know how
hard you've been working

45
00:01:49,686 --> 00:01:52,101
on cleaning yourself up
and everything, so...

46
00:01:52,827 --> 00:01:53,640
here.

47
00:01:53,748 --> 00:01:55,023
Yeah, that's me,

48
00:01:55,226 --> 00:01:56,523
all cleaned up.

49
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,283
Daniel, are you wearing makeup?

50
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:01,773
What, a guy can't wear a little
concealer without being judged? Come on.

51
00:02:01,877 --> 00:02:04,463
But you have a black eye.
How did--how did that happen?

52
00:02:04,566 --> 00:02:07,362
What, did Alexis do this to you?
I've only been gone for a week!

53
00:02:07,468 --> 00:02:09,101
No, it wasn't Alexis.

54
00:02:09,926 --> 00:02:11,541
It happened last night.

55
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:15,802
I saved this kid who fell in
the lake in Central Park.

56
00:02:16,297 --> 00:02:17,012
What?

57
00:02:17,116 --> 00:02:19,551
I saw this little girl--
actually, it was a girl scout--

58
00:02:19,656 --> 00:02:22,563
and she had fallen in the lake
by the boathouse, and I dove in

59
00:02:22,665 --> 00:02:25,141
and hit my head on a rock and pulled
her out. That was it. No biggie.

60
00:02:25,176 --> 00:02:27,171
Where are we ordering
lunch from today?

61
00:02:27,276 --> 00:02:30,742
Wait, Daniel,
you saved somebody's life?

62
00:02:30,846 --> 00:02:31,991
You're a hero!

63
00:02:32,096 --> 00:02:33,482
Okay! Okay, it's over.

64
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:35,410
I mean,
I did my good deed for the year.

65
00:02:35,515 --> 00:02:38,090
You know what?
I have something else for Henry.

66
00:02:38,286 --> 00:02:40,022
You deserve this.

67
00:02:43,668 --> 00:02:44,612
Gracias.

68
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:56,102
I thought I smelled jewelry.

69
00:02:56,207 --> 00:02:57,703
What is that?

70
00:02:58,086 --> 00:03:02,423
That is my way of thanking you for
giving me a second chance at happiness.

71
00:03:03,397 --> 00:03:04,522
Wilhelmina,

72
00:03:05,615 --> 00:03:07,793
will you spend the rest
of your life with me?

73
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:10,152
Oh, Bradford...

74
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:11,981
you know I will.

75
00:03:17,086 --> 00:03:18,820
Oh, my!

76
00:03:19,435 --> 00:03:22,932
It's... a big flower, isn't it?

77
00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:24,701
I designed it myself.

78
00:03:25,015 --> 00:03:29,362
It represents how
our love has bloomed.

79
00:03:32,298 --> 00:03:33,221
Happy?

80
00:03:33,327 --> 00:03:35,123
Deliriously.

81
00:03:36,207 --> 00:03:39,162
It's like I'm in a fairy tale.

82
00:03:39,388 --> 00:03:41,602
And you are my
beautiful princess.

83
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:50,350
That home-wrecking slut.

84
00:03:50,585 --> 00:03:53,493
I know she's the reason Bradford
sent over those divorce papers.

85
00:03:53,596 --> 00:03:56,691
Shut it, fish,
and just stack up another set of 40s.

86
00:03:57,735 --> 00:04:00,442
Forgive me, Yoga, but...

87
00:04:00,587 --> 00:04:06,840
are you sure you don't want to retain
just a dash of your femininity?

88
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:09,193
Buff and beautiful.

89
00:04:11,998 --> 00:04:13,602
Look, you said you would help.

90
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:16,212
My husband won't take my calls.
He won't see me.

91
00:04:16,316 --> 00:04:18,482
I know if I could just get to him,
I could save my marriage.

92
00:04:18,516 --> 00:04:19,923
Relax, fish, all right?

93
00:04:20,028 --> 00:04:22,773
It's all going down tomorrow
when they transfer us upstate.

94
00:04:22,878 --> 00:04:26,562
Four of us in that van--
you, me, Chartreuse...

95
00:04:26,856 --> 00:04:28,752
sugar-free Shirley.

96
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:33,822
The diabetic?

97
00:04:34,116 --> 00:04:37,632
That sweet thing is goin'
be the key to our plan.

98
00:04:40,326 --> 00:04:42,282
Hello, it's Alexis Meade.

99
00:04:42,387 --> 00:04:45,781
Um, I need to know when you'll
be taking care of the...

100
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,730
situation with my father.

101
00:04:47,838 --> 00:04:49,531
This waiting is
freaking me out.

102
00:04:49,635 --> 00:04:52,021
I told you,
it'll happen when it happens.

103
00:04:52,127 --> 00:04:53,401
The less you know, the better.

104
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:55,730
Now don't be stupid
enough to call me again.

105
00:04:57,198 --> 00:04:59,153
Alexis, have you
heard the news?

106
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:00,623
Is it my father? What happened?

107
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:02,742
No, uh, it's Daniel.

108
00:05:02,846 --> 00:05:06,573
This girl scout fell in a lake in Central
Park, and Daniel jumped in and saved her.

109
00:05:06,677 --> 00:05:09,570
He even hit his head on a
rock and got a black eye.

110
00:05:09,797 --> 00:05:10,822
Really?

111
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:12,480
Daniel did that?

112
00:05:12,585 --> 00:05:15,301
Look, I know things between the two
of you have been a little rough.

113
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:17,351
And I know that you think
he's a total screwup.

114
00:05:17,457 --> 00:05:19,603
But he is a really good person.

115
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:20,921
You're right.

116
00:05:21,135 --> 00:05:23,200
Sometimes I do forget that.

117
00:05:24,318 --> 00:05:27,313
Betty, I think we should acknowledge
his heroic efforts, don't you?

118
00:05:27,396 --> 00:05:28,743
Oh, cupcakes!

119
00:05:28,848 --> 00:05:31,913
Or--or something even more special,
like one big cake?

120
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:34,752
Maybe we can go even bigger.

121
00:05:35,727 --> 00:05:37,530
We should have a
press conference.

122
00:05:37,636 --> 00:05:40,481
Yeah! Okay!
Um, I'll get right on it.

123
00:05:57,337 --> 00:05:58,771
Oh, where have you been?!

124
00:05:58,877 --> 00:06:00,992
I had to wait for Christina
to go to the bathroom.

125
00:06:01,098 --> 00:06:03,923
That woman retains water
like a 2-humped camel.

126
00:06:04,026 --> 00:06:05,413
Speaking of humps...

127
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:09,850
I think I discovered what dear old
Fey Sommers used this secret room for.

128
00:06:11,896 --> 00:06:12,873
Look.

129
00:06:13,246 --> 00:06:14,082
No!

130
00:06:14,187 --> 00:06:16,893
Either that, or she had a
unique take on casual fridays.

131
00:06:16,998 --> 00:06:20,092
You don't think Fey and Bradford
would sneak in here and--

132
00:06:21,077 --> 00:06:23,353
Thank you for that image.
Now every time I look at the old man,

133
00:06:23,385 --> 00:06:25,173
I'm gonna picture him trussed
up like a Christmas goose

134
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,661
with a ball gag in his mouth.

135
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:28,210
Inhale Ricky Martin...

136
00:06:28,317 --> 00:06:29,932
exhale Colin Farrell.

137
00:06:30,036 --> 00:06:32,502
I still can't get
over this place.

138
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:35,173
It is, like,
four times the size of my studio.

139
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:37,440
Okay, we tell no
one about this.

140
00:06:37,547 --> 00:06:39,943
Except for the occasional
delivery guy who we lure in here

141
00:06:40,047 --> 00:06:41,450
to open up his packages.

142
00:06:41,557 --> 00:06:45,560
You are a very bad boy.

143
00:06:45,818 --> 00:06:46,610
Ow! Again

144
00:06:46,712 --> 00:06:47,998
- Bad boy!
- Ow! Again

145
00:06:48,156 --> 00:06:49,496
- Bad boy!
- Ow! Again.

146
00:06:49,591 --> 00:06:51,554
Okay, this is getting creepy,
even for us.

147
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:53,732
Can you believe it?

148
00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:56,810
That pathetic loser
stole my story.

149
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:57,931
Your story?

150
00:06:58,036 --> 00:07:01,881
When I was 14, I was the one who rescued
a kid from drowning in Central Park.

151
00:07:01,985 --> 00:07:03,650
I even hit my head on a rock.

152
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:07,201
So how do you think
Daniel got that shiner?

153
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:09,323
Beats me.

154
00:07:09,965 --> 00:07:13,192
But something tells me he
won't want it in the press.

155
00:07:18,057 --> 00:07:19,061
Daniel!

156
00:07:19,517 --> 00:07:21,733
- Hi. What are those?
- Oh, just a mint.

157
00:07:21,837 --> 00:07:23,461
Really? I've never
seen them so small.

158
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,972
There's Henry.
Why don't you go make awkward small talk

159
00:07:26,077 --> 00:07:27,221
with your little friend?

160
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,593
Oh, my god. Uh, give me a mint.

161
00:07:30,698 --> 00:07:32,611
What? No, no,
you don't need one.

162
00:07:32,716 --> 00:07:34,463
Daniel, I just had
an onion bagel.

163
00:07:34,568 --> 00:07:35,943
Betty, your breath...

164
00:07:36,047 --> 00:07:37,821
fresh as a daisy.

165
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:46,532
Hi.

166
00:07:46,888 --> 00:07:48,112
Oh, hi.

167
00:07:48,406 --> 00:07:51,193
Okay, "ringle" is my
new favorite word.

168
00:07:51,297 --> 00:07:53,042
And for the record,

169
00:07:53,145 --> 00:07:55,702
I know it's you when
you say "it's me."

170
00:07:56,216 --> 00:07:57,381
Thanks.

171
00:07:58,665 --> 00:07:59,740
Can we talk?

172
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:00,892
Yeah.

173
00:08:01,205 --> 00:08:03,063
Somewhere private?

174
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:10,892
Okay, I have something I have to tell you,
and then I'm probably gonna throw up

175
00:08:10,905 --> 00:08:13,363
so I'm apologizing
for that in advance.

176
00:08:14,218 --> 00:08:16,433
Could we please just
have one minute?

177
00:08:16,535 --> 00:08:17,733
Thank you.

178
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:20,272
I did a lot of thinking...

179
00:08:25,586 --> 00:08:28,061
I did a lot of thinking
while I was in Mexico,

180
00:08:28,168 --> 00:08:30,961
and I realized that you very rarely
get everything you want in life.

181
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:33,011
But if you don't
fight for it, then...

182
00:08:33,217 --> 00:08:36,623
you have even less of a chance.
So here I am,

183
00:08:36,946 --> 00:08:38,123
fighting...

184
00:08:39,237 --> 00:08:40,433
for you.

185
00:08:40,638 --> 00:08:43,082
And I know you're still
with Charlie, but--

186
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:46,932
Okay, seriously,
just 30 more seconds. Please?

187
00:08:47,597 --> 00:08:49,763
I think you and I would
be amazing, Henry.

188
00:08:49,866 --> 00:08:52,431
We--we--we know what the
other one's thinking, and--

189
00:08:52,538 --> 00:08:55,140
and we always laugh at
the same things, and--

190
00:08:55,248 --> 00:08:58,572
you make my mouth go dry every
time you walk into a room.

191
00:08:59,935 --> 00:09:02,963
The only thing I ask is that when you
reject me, just--just do it quick.

192
00:09:03,068 --> 00:09:05,350
You know,
like ripping a band-aid off...

193
00:09:06,028 --> 00:09:07,600
off of my heart.

194
00:09:08,368 --> 00:09:10,082
I broke up with Charlie.

195
00:09:11,165 --> 00:09:12,240
What?

196
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:16,251
Will you forget the stupid copies?!
There are lives going on in here!

197
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:19,542
You were saying?

198
00:09:19,647 --> 00:09:21,502
She's not the one
for me, Betty.

199
00:09:22,088 --> 00:09:23,511
There's someone else...

200
00:09:24,507 --> 00:09:26,403
who makes my mouth go dry.

201
00:09:26,716 --> 00:09:28,601
Who is hogging the...

202
00:09:29,127 --> 00:09:32,013
Ew. Dorkus interruptus.

203
00:09:32,116 --> 00:09:33,452
- Get out!
- Get out!

204
00:09:34,547 --> 00:09:36,011
Hey, everyone!

205
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,841
Betty's in heat.

206
00:09:41,106 --> 00:09:43,981
This isn't exactly
how I pictured this.

207
00:09:44,088 --> 00:09:45,260
You're right.

208
00:09:45,407 --> 00:09:47,140
We need to have a real date.

209
00:09:47,248 --> 00:09:48,743
Our first date?

210
00:09:49,397 --> 00:09:50,740
Our first date.

211
00:09:53,288 --> 00:09:54,542
What's that guy's name?

212
00:09:54,647 --> 00:09:56,793
Is that the guy who
looks like C-3PO?

213
00:09:56,895 --> 00:09:58,290
Is tomorrow night at 8:00 okay?

214
00:09:58,397 --> 00:09:59,750
That's great.

215
00:10:00,216 --> 00:10:01,433
Okay.

216
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,122

219
00:10:33,505 --> 00:10:36,121
Don't put that in your mouth.
I just cleaned my nails with it.

220
00:10:36,228 --> 00:10:37,350
Kidding.

221
00:10:37,976 --> 00:10:39,691
They're totally sterile.

222
00:10:40,497 --> 00:10:43,340
So... Betty Suarez. You're
Dr. Farkas' patient, huh?

223
00:10:43,448 --> 00:10:46,033
Yeah, but I'm just here
today for a cleaning.

224
00:10:46,135 --> 00:10:48,961
I have my first date tonight with
a guy I'm really crazy about,

225
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:51,220
and I want my teeth to sparkle.

226
00:10:51,326 --> 00:10:54,041
Oh, my god,
that is so romantic.

227
00:10:54,148 --> 00:10:58,023
It's like when Julia Roberts flossed
before whoring herself in "Pretty Woman."

228
00:10:58,128 --> 00:10:59,561
Oh, such a great movie,

229
00:10:59,668 --> 00:11:01,751
and an important message.

230
00:11:01,855 --> 00:11:04,410
Okay, I just checked her file.

231
00:11:04,518 --> 00:11:06,373
She had a cleaning
two months ago.

232
00:11:06,478 --> 00:11:09,482
Her insurance will only
cover this every six months.

233
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:12,382
Oh, rinse and spit, Angelica.
Just put it through!

234
00:11:12,487 --> 00:11:14,291
Where's your sense of romance?

235
00:11:14,396 --> 00:11:16,151
She's doing this for
the man she loves.

236
00:11:16,256 --> 00:11:18,472
Oh! We should give
you pink rubber bands.

237
00:11:18,576 --> 00:11:20,403
Oh! Yeah,
that would be really fun.

238
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:22,761
Dentistry is not about fun.

239
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:27,272
You always think you can bend all the
rules because you are pretty and blonde.

240
00:11:27,727 --> 00:11:29,643
- Is she okay?
- Oh, she's just mad

241
00:11:29,748 --> 00:11:32,962
because we had a nitrous party here the
other night, and we didn't invite her!

242
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,132
That was unethical...
and costly.

243
00:11:35,238 --> 00:11:37,082
Back to your cave, Shrek!

244
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:38,510
Don't worry about her.

245
00:11:38,618 --> 00:11:40,261
Just believe in the magic.

246
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,420
Ah, you are totally
Bridget Jones!

247
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:44,800
Did you see that movie?
That is such a great movie!

248
00:11:44,907 --> 00:11:46,970
I mean, one.
Two was a little... eh.

249
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:48,061
Let's see.

250
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:53,520
Yep, it looks like we have a little
cavity on Mr. Lower Left Six.

251
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:56,401
You know what? We can get you
novocained up and a dentist here

252
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,593
- in two secs.
- No! No. Ow.

253
00:11:58,698 --> 00:12:00,413
Uh, no. No novocain. Please.

254
00:12:00,516 --> 00:12:02,162
I'll--I'll come back tomorrow.

255
00:12:02,265 --> 00:12:04,330
Um, it's just that,

256
00:12:04,435 --> 00:12:07,082
if my lips are gonna be tingly,
then I-I...

257
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:09,803
I want it to be
because of Henry.

258
00:12:11,505 --> 00:12:13,793
You are such a chick flick.

259
00:12:13,896 --> 00:12:16,391
I would totally
pay $12 to see you.

260
00:12:16,496 --> 00:12:18,150
- Really?
- Yes.

261
00:12:19,307 --> 00:12:20,442
So you don't like the white?

262
00:12:20,545 --> 00:12:21,842
Nah, I like the white.

263
00:12:21,947 --> 00:12:23,610
So what's wrong with the red?

264
00:12:23,715 --> 00:12:25,022
I'm gonna eat a cupcake.

265
00:12:25,128 --> 00:12:27,172
Mom, can you run lines with me?

266
00:12:27,276 --> 00:12:29,690
You know, just in case something
bad happens to Joey Colano

267
00:12:29,796 --> 00:12:32,362
and I have to go on as Tony.
I mean, I am his understudy--

268
00:12:32,468 --> 00:12:35,043
Sweetie, can we forget about
"West Side Story" for two minutes?

269
00:12:35,147 --> 00:12:36,610
You know,
we're trying to plan a wedding here.

270
00:12:36,705 --> 00:12:37,622
That's right, best man.

271
00:12:37,725 --> 00:12:38,950
What, you don't want
to help with this?

272
00:12:38,986 --> 00:12:42,040
I told mom if she went with the
green organza for the bridesmaid

273
00:12:42,147 --> 00:12:43,802
she was on her own.

274
00:12:44,235 --> 00:12:47,392
Okay, I'm thinking we do this at
our Lady of Guadalupe church.

275
00:12:47,496 --> 00:12:49,043
You know,
next to the gas station?

276
00:12:49,158 --> 00:12:52,370
Oh, and we should see if we can get
Fat Louie or Bad-Skin Louie to deejay.

277
00:12:52,475 --> 00:12:56,280
I want Saint Patrick's cathedral
and the Harlem Boys Choir.

278
00:12:56,387 --> 00:12:58,453
- A dealon a buffet.
- And the medallions of lamb

279
00:12:58,555 --> 00:13:01,113
should be followed by
the foie gras en terrine.

280
00:13:01,217 --> 00:13:05,402
Book Mario Testino. Have him photograph
the whole thing in sepia tones.

281
00:13:05,507 --> 00:13:08,513
And we put one of these on every table,
and bam!

282
00:13:08,615 --> 00:13:09,570
I love you.

283
00:13:09,677 --> 00:13:11,192
I love me.

284
00:13:11,895 --> 00:13:13,103
Wow!

285
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:16,212
I walk away for a hot second,
and you look five years younger.

286
00:13:16,317 --> 00:13:18,471
Woman, are you aging backwards?

287
00:13:18,576 --> 00:13:19,990
Ah... what happened?

288
00:13:20,096 --> 00:13:21,073
Oh, little glitch.

289
00:13:21,177 --> 00:13:24,461
Teeny, tiny...
Cindy Crawford mole-sized problem.

290
00:13:24,568 --> 00:13:28,933
It looks like Saint Patrick's
cathedral's already booked on june 16th.

291
00:13:29,038 --> 00:13:30,061
What?!

292
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,631
What do you get from Saint Patrick's?
Bad incense

293
00:13:32,735 --> 00:13:34,823
and a bunch of guilty
men in dresses.

294
00:13:34,926 --> 00:13:36,872
Wilhelmina Slater is
marrying Bradford Meade.

295
00:13:36,977 --> 00:13:38,821
This wedding has to bean event.

296
00:13:38,926 --> 00:13:41,860
It's the only date that works for both
of us. Just bump the other bride.

297
00:13:41,968 --> 00:13:44,052
Actually, it's, um...

298
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:47,803
our top advertiser... Fabia.

299
00:13:47,965 --> 00:13:49,151
Fabia?!

300
00:13:49,508 --> 00:13:51,672
That little euro-wench
is getting married?

301
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:54,271
And she got Elton John
to sing for the wedding.

302
00:13:54,378 --> 00:13:56,440
He's rewritten "Candle in
the Wind" just for her.

303
00:13:56,547 --> 00:13:57,331
What?!

304
00:13:57,438 --> 00:13:59,463
He was rewriting "Candle
in the Wind" for me!

305
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:02,532
Oh! Give that queen 20 bucks,
and she'll rewrite it for anybody.

306
00:14:02,638 --> 00:14:04,141
Get Fabia over here.

307
00:14:04,248 --> 00:14:07,753
Wedding summit '07... is on.

308
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:10,262
Daniel!

309
00:14:10,905 --> 00:14:14,401
Please follow me. There's someone in
your office I'd like you to meet.

310
00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:15,882
What's that look?

311
00:14:15,987 --> 00:14:17,051
You've got that look.

312
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:19,783
What? Y-you think
you know my looks?

313
00:14:21,087 --> 00:14:23,060
Surprise!

314
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,800
That's so sweet,
you know my looks.

315
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:27,293
What is all this?

316
00:14:27,398 --> 00:14:29,712
You saved a girl scout.
You're being honored.

317
00:14:29,818 --> 00:14:31,681
And let's face it,
you could use the good press.

318
00:14:31,715 --> 00:14:35,022
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Daniel Meade,

319
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,480
fashion editor/hero.

320
00:14:40,557 --> 00:14:42,410
- This is for you.
- Well, thank you.

321
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:44,852
Uh, I don't know what to say.

322
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,430
Well, you can start by letting
everyone know the exact details

323
00:14:47,517 --> 00:14:49,270
of how you saved
the kid in the lake.

324
00:14:49,376 --> 00:14:51,612
Uh, well,
I saw this girl scout.

325
00:14:51,716 --> 00:14:53,732
She fell in the lake,
and I saved her.

326
00:14:53,836 --> 00:14:54,871
What time of day?

327
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,263
Um, m-morning.

328
00:14:56,367 --> 00:14:57,972
Wouldn't she be in school?

329
00:14:58,075 --> 00:14:59,591
Maybe she was skipping.

330
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,763
Do girl scouts skip school?

331
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:03,540
No!

332
00:15:04,678 --> 00:15:06,043
And how'd you hit your head?

333
00:15:06,147 --> 00:15:09,512
Uh, just slipped on the rocks when
I was getting out of the lake.

334
00:15:09,615 --> 00:15:12,453
I thought you hit your
head as you dove in.

335
00:15:12,836 --> 00:15:14,452
I think he's lying.

336
00:15:14,555 --> 00:15:16,080
Is it good to lie?

337
00:15:16,187 --> 00:15:17,762
No!

338
00:15:33,947 --> 00:15:35,703
Would you help me up?

339
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:41,872
Give me one reason
why I should do this.

340
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:46,153
$50,000 deposited in
your daughter's account.

341
00:15:46,305 --> 00:15:48,140
Take the candy bar, please.

342
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:53,943
Nice work, bitch.

343
00:15:54,505 --> 00:15:56,771
What--what happened to "fish"?

344
00:15:57,438 --> 00:16:01,401
"Fish" become "bitch"
after two weeks.

345
00:16:04,477 --> 00:16:07,141
Oh, my god,
you got beat up by a drug dealer?

346
00:16:07,247 --> 00:16:10,783
Look, he... just took some money
and one very expensive watch,

347
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:14,042
which I really didn't like anyway.
But that's it. I'm fine.

348
00:16:14,147 --> 00:16:16,032
It not like I'm
gonna use him again.

349
00:16:16,135 --> 00:16:17,413
Use him?

350
00:16:17,515 --> 00:16:19,662
Daniel, what about the drugs?

351
00:16:19,766 --> 00:16:21,940
Well, come on,
it's more like medicine,

352
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:26,763
except I happen to buy it from a guy who
has a shaved head and a neck tattoo.

353
00:16:26,897 --> 00:16:28,791
Don't look at me like that.

354
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,591
I'm still able to work,

355
00:16:30,788 --> 00:16:33,562
and I'm not using sex
to avoid my problems.

356
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:35,833
Because you're using drugs
to avoid your problems.

357
00:16:35,936 --> 00:16:37,530
- Daniel--
- Bye! See ya!

358
00:16:37,635 --> 00:16:40,541
I know, I know,
you're disappointed in me.

359
00:16:40,906 --> 00:16:45,571
No, Daniel,
I am so past disappointed.

360
00:16:52,415 --> 00:16:53,930
Fabia!

361
00:16:55,227 --> 00:16:57,203
Why is Fabia here today?

362
00:16:57,308 --> 00:17:00,691
I thought that I had my meeting
for my cosmetic layout tomorrow.

363
00:17:00,795 --> 00:17:04,000
Well, I couldn't wait to congratulate
you on your upcoming nuptials.

364
00:17:04,105 --> 00:17:05,820
Oh! Grazie.

365
00:17:05,928 --> 00:17:07,800
I had them done
for the wedding.

366
00:17:08,556 --> 00:17:11,160
Ooh! Here's a picture
of my boyfriend.

367
00:17:11,268 --> 00:17:15,991
Dimitri is largest shipping
magnate in the world!

368
00:17:16,097 --> 00:17:18,910
Oh! I love him!

369
00:17:19,825 --> 00:17:22,862
I need to marry him before his
bambinos cut me out of the will.

370
00:17:22,967 --> 00:17:25,093
Ah, a love story for the ages.

371
00:17:25,197 --> 00:17:26,832
You must come to the ceremony.

372
00:17:26,938 --> 00:17:30,200
I wouldn't be able to get married
without my "something old."

373
00:17:30,306 --> 00:17:33,872
With the veins in your legs,
you already have your "something blue."

374
00:17:33,976 --> 00:17:35,652
I'm just sick.
I can't be there.

375
00:17:35,756 --> 00:17:39,963
I'm also getting married on the 16th
to, um, Bradford Meade.

376
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:42,693
Oh! Big fish.

377
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,782
It's just too bad that you
won't be able to get married

378
00:17:45,888 --> 00:17:48,080
at Saint Patrick's
day cathedral.

379
00:17:48,185 --> 00:17:49,842
Mm, so this is how we're
gonna play it, huh?

380
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,340
Oh, poor Wilhelmina.

381
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,593
I suppose you're going to have
to change your wedding date.

382
00:17:54,696 --> 00:17:56,530
Or do a quickie in Las Vegas.

383
00:17:56,637 --> 00:17:58,892
Wilhelmina Slater
does not do Vegas.

384
00:17:58,998 --> 00:18:01,952
Now I want my Saint Patrick's
and I want my Elton John.

385
00:18:02,057 --> 00:18:05,263
There must be something you
want in exchange for the 16th.

386
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:07,861
Mm... I don't know.

387
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:09,622
Anything.

388
00:18:12,455 --> 00:18:14,431
I want that girl.

389
00:18:18,408 --> 00:18:20,881
He's going to hate it, dad.
What do I do?

390
00:18:20,987 --> 00:18:22,463
Just add cilantro.

391
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:24,653
I don't think I got cilantro.

392
00:18:24,758 --> 00:18:26,193
Can I just add
some extra cheese?

393
00:18:26,297 --> 00:18:29,691
You didn't buy chili powder and
you used ketchup, so why not?

394
00:18:29,796 --> 00:18:33,290
Dad, this has to turn out great.
It's my first date with Henry.

395
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:35,510
I remember the first time
your mother made me dinner.

396
00:18:35,526 --> 00:18:37,363
It tasted like shoe leather.

397
00:18:37,465 --> 00:18:39,711
But I didn't care,
because she made it.

398
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:43,282
Well, how do you make shoe leather?
Because I think that might be better.

399
00:18:44,236 --> 00:18:45,812
Dad, I miss you.

400
00:18:45,978 --> 00:18:47,643
When are you coming home?

401
00:18:47,937 --> 00:18:50,272
I'll be home before
you know it, Betty.

402
00:18:50,816 --> 00:18:52,072
Be strong.

403
00:18:52,856 --> 00:18:55,020
And remember the most
important thing--

404
00:18:55,756 --> 00:18:58,253
there are take-out menus
on top of the fridge.

405
00:18:59,477 --> 00:19:00,840
I love you.

406
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,483
I love you, too.

407
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:04,661
Te quiero.

408
00:19:15,305 --> 00:19:16,563
You're early!

409
00:19:21,188 --> 00:19:22,252
Charlie.

410
00:19:22,735 --> 00:19:24,150
What are you doing here?

411
00:19:24,256 --> 00:19:28,040
Well, I called Henry at the office,
but the receptionist said he'd be here.

412
00:19:28,215 --> 00:19:32,700
Yeah. Uh, I'm...
just making him dinner.

413
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,223
Oh, really?

414
00:19:34,326 --> 00:19:36,833
Well, I have something
in the oven, too.

415
00:19:37,248 --> 00:19:38,850
I'm pregnant.

416
00:19:42,005 --> 00:19:43,393
You're pregnant.

417
00:19:43,498 --> 00:19:45,210
I leave for Tucson tomorrow,

418
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,733
and I thought he should
know as soon as possible.

419
00:19:47,985 --> 00:19:49,503
And ruining your date?

420
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,330
Nice little bonus.

421
00:19:53,957 --> 00:19:56,422
Pink gerber daisies
for my lady.

422
00:20:00,218 --> 00:20:01,231
What are you doing here?

423
00:20:01,338 --> 00:20:03,312
Can we step outside and talk?

424
00:20:06,216 --> 00:20:07,691
You should talk to her.

425
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:33,351
Oh, Hilda, you are so hot.

426
00:20:33,455 --> 00:20:34,583
You know I am!

427
00:20:34,688 --> 00:20:38,141
Mom, I'm Tony! I'm Tony!

428
00:20:38,245 --> 00:20:39,770
Sweetie, I know
you want the part,

429
00:20:39,877 --> 00:20:41,961
but you can't shriek
it into existence.

430
00:20:42,065 --> 00:20:43,892
No, that was
Mr. Weaver on the phone.

431
00:20:43,998 --> 00:20:46,232
Joey Colano woke up
totally covered in hives!

432
00:20:46,337 --> 00:20:48,700
- Isn't that great?
- Ay, that poor kid.

433
00:20:48,807 --> 00:20:51,150
Guess he had an allergic
reaction to the walnuts he ate.

434
00:20:51,258 --> 00:20:53,843
Well, if he's allergic,
why did he eat them?

435
00:20:53,948 --> 00:20:56,510
It's not my fault he wanted
to trade sandwiches.

436
00:20:56,617 --> 00:21:00,113
But... I didn't put walnuts
in your chicken salad.

437
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:02,313
Oh. I think I did.

438
00:21:02,415 --> 00:21:04,700
Rachael Ray says that it
adds a little crunch.

439
00:21:05,155 --> 00:21:08,253
What is with the third degree?
Your son is Tony. Be happy.

440
00:21:11,427 --> 00:21:14,293
Nah. He wouldn't.

441
00:21:15,377 --> 00:21:18,303
Christina, I'm going
out of my mind.

442
00:21:18,405 --> 00:21:20,850
He said he was gonna call.
He hasn't called.

443
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,901
And Charlie's flight
leaves to Tucson tonight.

444
00:21:24,447 --> 00:21:25,822
I can't sleep!

445
00:21:26,135 --> 00:21:27,733
I can't eat!

446
00:21:30,318 --> 00:21:31,720
Well, I can't sleep.

447
00:21:31,826 --> 00:21:33,820
Betty, just because
she's pregnant

448
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:35,713
doesn't mean he's gonna
get back with the whore.

449
00:21:35,745 --> 00:21:37,211
Sorry, was that a bit harsh?

450
00:21:37,317 --> 00:21:38,843
I'm just trying
to be supportive.

451
00:21:39,127 --> 00:21:42,180
Oh, my god.
It's a text message from Henry.

452
00:21:42,627 --> 00:21:43,721
"Can we talk?"

453
00:21:43,826 --> 00:21:45,562
It's good.
Men never wanna talk.

454
00:21:45,665 --> 00:21:47,603
Okay. Wish me luck.

455
00:21:55,768 --> 00:21:57,121
Where did you come from?

456
00:21:57,228 --> 00:22:00,202
Um... nowhere.

457
00:22:00,305 --> 00:22:01,870
You weren't there a second ago.

458
00:22:01,976 --> 00:22:03,861
Yes, I was.

459
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:05,842
How drunk are you?

460
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:09,313
What is that?

461
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:13,042
No! No,
this is my special place!

462
00:22:14,468 --> 00:22:18,752
Oh, my god!
It's Fey's Love Dungeon!

463
00:22:18,886 --> 00:22:20,483
It is real!

464
00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:22,622
And now my special
place is ruined.

465
00:22:22,726 --> 00:22:25,720
Oh, please. Your "special
place" was ruined years ago.

466
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:28,731
Okay, you've seen it. Get out.

467
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,472
Oh, no.

468
00:22:33,976 --> 00:22:35,920
Oh, my god. It's jammed shut.

469
00:22:36,028 --> 00:22:37,420
We're locked in.

470
00:22:37,776 --> 00:22:39,680
No. No, no, no, no.
We can't be.

471
00:22:39,788 --> 00:22:41,312
We're not locked in!

472
00:22:42,765 --> 00:22:47,371
- Help! Help!
- Help! Help!

473
00:22:49,097 --> 00:22:50,581
So... that's it?

474
00:22:50,686 --> 00:22:52,582
You're leaving mom
after 38 years?

475
00:22:52,688 --> 00:22:55,161
I mean, now when
she needs you more than ever?

476
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:56,552
For what?

477
00:22:56,856 --> 00:22:58,363
So you can be alone?

478
00:22:58,467 --> 00:23:00,502
Actually, I don't
intend to be alone.

479
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,811
What are you talking about?

480
00:23:01,917 --> 00:23:04,391
I've been lucky enough to
find someone that loves me,

481
00:23:04,498 --> 00:23:06,691
and I'd be a fool to
let that pass me by.

482
00:23:06,795 --> 00:23:07,813
Who is it?

483
00:23:07,918 --> 00:23:09,472
Hello, Daniel.

484
00:23:12,456 --> 00:23:13,700
Wilhelmina.

485
00:23:15,195 --> 00:23:16,911
Call me mommy.

486
00:23:22,176 --> 00:23:23,892
I don't know what else to do.

487
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:26,072
It's my baby.

488
00:23:28,555 --> 00:23:31,840
Betty, I grew up without a father.
I can't do that to my child.

489
00:23:31,948 --> 00:23:33,342
I have to go to
Tucson with them.

490
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:36,011
No. No, Henry, I-I get that.

491
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:37,880
You know, I...

492
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:39,830
just...

493
00:23:41,777 --> 00:23:45,560
thought that for one day,
we were finally...

494
00:23:48,117 --> 00:23:50,712
and I was... I was happy.

495
00:23:52,586 --> 00:23:53,753
I was, too.

496
00:23:57,697 --> 00:24:00,270
I guess that would've
been too easy, huh?

497
00:24:03,586 --> 00:24:05,080
So, um...

498
00:24:06,327 --> 00:24:08,370
when do you and Charlie leave?

499
00:24:09,207 --> 00:24:10,323
Tonight.

500
00:24:13,807 --> 00:24:15,693
So I guess...

501
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:17,953
I guess this is, um...

502
00:24:24,735 --> 00:24:27,083
I want you to have a
really wonderful life.

503
00:24:29,585 --> 00:24:30,772
You deserve it.

504
00:25:04,326 --> 00:25:07,581
And for this layout,
Fabia had vision.

505
00:25:07,985 --> 00:25:10,510
All the models should look
like they are suffering

506
00:25:10,617 --> 00:25:13,700
from sickness of radiation,
like Chernobyl.

507
00:25:13,807 --> 00:25:17,981
Only this time,
it is my makeup that makes them glow.

508
00:25:18,088 --> 00:25:20,893
That's just... brilliant.

509
00:25:21,445 --> 00:25:24,591
We'll have a storyboard
ready for you by next week.

510
00:25:25,078 --> 00:25:26,941
All right, come on, baby!

511
00:25:28,545 --> 00:25:30,210
Oop-y.

512
00:25:30,338 --> 00:25:32,661
Picchu made brown.

513
00:25:33,767 --> 00:25:36,313
Marco, clean it up. Ciao.

514
00:25:44,915 --> 00:25:46,060
Marc...

515
00:25:47,648 --> 00:25:50,643
I-I didn't get a chance
to explain, but...

516
00:25:51,458 --> 00:25:52,632
Are you smoking?

517
00:25:52,736 --> 00:25:54,351
Yes. She makes me.

518
00:25:54,455 --> 00:25:56,270
And she makes me eat pasta.

519
00:25:56,378 --> 00:25:58,152
Well, you do look heavy.

520
00:25:58,257 --> 00:25:59,870
What's wrong with your eyes?

521
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:02,311
Uh, Fabia doesn't believe
intesting her products on animals,

522
00:26:02,346 --> 00:26:05,973
but, uh, she does believe in
testing them on assistants.

523
00:26:06,246 --> 00:26:07,841
- Disgraceful.
- Yeah.

524
00:26:07,946 --> 00:26:09,653
- What about the insurance?
- Full dental.

525
00:26:09,756 --> 00:26:10,832
- Well, that's good.
- Yeah.

526
00:26:10,856 --> 00:26:12,111
Marco!

527
00:26:13,956 --> 00:26:15,083
Well...

528
00:26:16,298 --> 00:26:19,151
I hope june 16th was worth it.

529
00:26:57,506 --> 00:26:58,642
Marc.

530
00:27:23,046 --> 00:27:24,641
Mom, I've lost it.

531
00:27:24,745 --> 00:27:26,913
I go on in two hours,
and I can't snap.

532
00:27:27,018 --> 00:27:29,092
What kind of gang
member can't snap?!

533
00:27:29,198 --> 00:27:31,541
You're gonna snap, all right.
You need to relax.

534
00:27:31,648 --> 00:27:33,972
Just eat something.
Look, I made you a pizza bagel.

535
00:27:34,077 --> 00:27:37,941
Did Angela Landsbury eat a pizza bagel
before she opened in "Sweeney Todd"?

536
00:27:38,046 --> 00:27:39,982
All I got was "pizza bagel."

537
00:27:40,886 --> 00:27:42,901
You know what, kid?
You're gonna do great tonight.

538
00:27:43,006 --> 00:27:44,063
You'll be there, right?

539
00:27:44,168 --> 00:27:45,363
Of course I'm gonna be there.

540
00:27:45,467 --> 00:27:46,831
I wouldn't miss it.

541
00:27:47,068 --> 00:27:48,132
Okay.

542
00:27:49,226 --> 00:27:51,662
Hey, spit on your fingers.

543
00:27:51,996 --> 00:27:54,992
Uh, dad, it's "break a leg,"
not "spit on your fingers."

544
00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:56,803
No, no, it helps. Watch.

545
00:28:06,858 --> 00:28:08,162
Attaboy.

546
00:28:17,898 --> 00:28:19,891
- Hey.
- Are you lost again?

547
00:28:19,996 --> 00:28:22,093
Your office is two whores down.

548
00:28:22,406 --> 00:28:24,590
I just, uh, came to good-bye.

549
00:28:24,698 --> 00:28:26,481
Okay. See ya tomorrow.

550
00:28:26,587 --> 00:28:30,042
Uh, no, you won't.
I'm, uh, I'm actually gone.

551
00:28:30,145 --> 00:28:32,763
I just, uh... I'm quitting.

552
00:28:32,865 --> 00:28:35,900
Oh. Here--here's my pen.

553
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,781
What are you babbling about?

554
00:28:37,888 --> 00:28:39,551
There's nothing
left here, right?

555
00:28:39,656 --> 00:28:43,070
I mean, mom's gonna be in
jail for who knows how long.

556
00:28:43,177 --> 00:28:45,881
Dad just told me about
him and "Milhelwina."

557
00:28:45,985 --> 00:28:49,830
They're probably gonna have
some devil child together.

558
00:28:50,025 --> 00:28:51,350
Okay, I'm lost.

559
00:28:51,455 --> 00:28:53,243
You know what the
funny thing is?

560
00:28:54,455 --> 00:28:56,671
I don't have anyone to turn to.

561
00:28:57,386 --> 00:28:59,833
I guess that's not very funny,
is it?

562
00:29:01,136 --> 00:29:03,071
- Daniel, you're loaded.
- Oh, just admit it.

563
00:29:03,178 --> 00:29:04,580
You hate me!

564
00:29:07,765 --> 00:29:09,790
And now the girl
scouts hate me.

565
00:29:10,368 --> 00:29:13,781
But the thing is,
I don't hate you.

566
00:29:14,828 --> 00:29:16,423
You wanna know a secret?

567
00:29:19,127 --> 00:29:20,843
When I thought you were dead,

568
00:29:22,257 --> 00:29:24,951
I used to go visit your
grave every sunday.

569
00:29:25,428 --> 00:29:27,501
Sometimes I still want to...

570
00:29:30,376 --> 00:29:32,092
'cause I still miss you.

571
00:29:37,135 --> 00:29:38,793
Daniel, seriously...

572
00:29:39,047 --> 00:29:40,673
what did you take and how many?

573
00:29:40,778 --> 00:29:41,982
It was like...

574
00:29:43,178 --> 00:29:44,481
seven.

575
00:29:44,607 --> 00:29:46,171
I mean, I've taken...

576
00:29:46,776 --> 00:29:49,602
like, 12 before,
just not with...

577
00:29:49,805 --> 00:29:51,093
this much booze.

578
00:29:51,197 --> 00:29:53,813
Hey, Alexis,
I have the art department on line one.

579
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:56,181
Whoa! I hope he's not driving.

580
00:29:56,286 --> 00:29:58,232
He's not.
I'm taking him to Pine Crest.

581
00:29:58,336 --> 00:30:00,661
I need a town car... now.

582
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:01,892
It might be a while.

583
00:30:01,998 --> 00:30:05,073
Paula Abdul's fragrance release party
is tonight. Cars are booked solid.

584
00:30:05,177 --> 00:30:08,370
Then run down to the valet and
get the keys to my dad's car.

585
00:30:08,477 --> 00:30:10,052
I have to go
to Paula's party.

586
00:30:10,157 --> 00:30:12,110
Now she's gonna hate me, too?

587
00:30:13,886 --> 00:30:15,713
If you ask me,
I think she trapped him.

588
00:30:15,817 --> 00:30:17,781
You know she poked a
hole in that condom.

589
00:30:17,886 --> 00:30:20,751
I'm not really interested in
hearing the specifics right now.

590
00:30:20,855 --> 00:30:23,003
So you ready for
a little nitrous?

591
00:30:23,108 --> 00:30:24,290
No, thank you.

592
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:25,882
I wanna feel the pain.

593
00:30:25,986 --> 00:30:27,923
Oh, I hate this girl.

594
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:30,243
What's her name,
so I can hate her with a name?

595
00:30:30,345 --> 00:30:32,211
- Charlie.
- Charlie.

596
00:30:32,316 --> 00:30:34,393
Charlie? That's funny.

597
00:30:34,498 --> 00:30:37,692
Dr. Farkas has been dating a girl named
Charlie for, like, two months now.

598
00:30:37,798 --> 00:30:40,893
Well, it can't be the same Charlie
because she's been with Henry.

599
00:30:40,996 --> 00:30:43,921
This one's a cute redhead.
She makes jewelry.

600
00:30:44,027 --> 00:30:46,281
She made all the girls
in the office this.

601
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:48,602
I hate it,
but Farkas was in today, so...

602
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:50,662
Oh, my god,
this is Henry's Charlie.

603
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:54,332
I-I took Dr. Farkas
to Charlie's birthday party.

604
00:30:54,438 --> 00:30:57,252
Oh, my god! I introduced them!

605
00:30:57,808 --> 00:30:59,293
So she's been cheating?

606
00:30:59,397 --> 00:31:01,250
Charlie's a cheater!

607
00:31:01,708 --> 00:31:03,023
You know what?

608
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:04,683
Forget I said anything.

609
00:31:04,785 --> 00:31:07,442
I just keep talking when
I shouldn't be talking.

610
00:31:07,546 --> 00:31:09,341
Frankly, a little
me goes a long way.

611
00:31:09,447 --> 00:31:10,573
Do you know what this means?

612
00:31:10,676 --> 00:31:11,452
No.

613
00:31:11,555 --> 00:31:13,962
Maybe the baby isn't Henry's!

614
00:31:17,238 --> 00:31:18,811
So Henry, call me back.

615
00:31:18,917 --> 00:31:20,831
I really need to talk to you.

616
00:31:21,016 --> 00:31:22,950
You're leaving him a
message on his cell?

617
00:31:23,058 --> 00:31:26,433
You're telling the man you love that
his girlfriend's baby may not be his?

618
00:31:26,538 --> 00:31:28,782
Would Reese Witherspoon
leave a message on his cell?

619
00:31:28,885 --> 00:31:31,050
- Reese Witherspoon?
- Or Drew Barrymore?

620
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:33,193
No, I-I don't--I don't think
those women are calling Henry.

621
00:31:33,226 --> 00:31:35,950
No, because they're already halfway
to the airport to stop that plane

622
00:31:35,988 --> 00:31:38,153
and declare their
love for their man!

623
00:31:39,386 --> 00:31:42,022
Okay, maybe I do escape to the movies
a little more often than I should,

624
00:31:42,057 --> 00:31:44,720
- but this is your movie, Betty.
- It is?

625
00:31:44,827 --> 00:31:47,791
This is your chance for the happy
ending you've always wanted.

626
00:31:47,896 --> 00:31:50,440
Now go home and put on
some totally cute top.

627
00:31:50,547 --> 00:31:51,873
And run a brush
through that hair...

628
00:31:51,907 --> 00:31:53,070
or maybe a hat,

629
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:54,691
and go and stop that plane!

630
00:31:54,797 --> 00:31:56,961
- You're Drew Barrymore.
- Okay!

631
00:31:57,418 --> 00:32:00,902
Wait, I have my nephew's show tonight,
and I don't know Henry's flight number.

632
00:32:01,005 --> 00:32:03,833
- What about security? I--
- Drew Barrymore!

633
00:32:10,827 --> 00:32:12,912
Lorraine, I need graphics.

634
00:32:13,188 --> 00:32:15,361
Coming right up, Ms. Slater.

635
00:32:15,468 --> 00:32:19,123
What happened to you, Lorraine?
You suddenly seem more feminine.

636
00:32:19,226 --> 00:32:20,692
Fabia fired me.

637
00:32:20,795 --> 00:32:23,412
No explanation.
She just put out a cigarette on my arm

638
00:32:23,518 --> 00:32:24,932
and said, "get out!"

639
00:32:25,105 --> 00:32:28,281
So I'm free and ready
to come back to work...

640
00:32:28,388 --> 00:32:29,963
if you'll have me.

641
00:32:30,068 --> 00:32:33,481
Well, you do already know
how I like my coffee.

642
00:32:33,587 --> 00:32:35,501
Not to mention how you
plotted to destroy Daniel

643
00:32:35,546 --> 00:32:37,633
and convinced Bradford to
divorce Claire and marry you

644
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:39,940
so that you could take
over Meade Enterprises.

645
00:32:40,047 --> 00:32:41,661
Oh, yeah, that, too.

646
00:32:41,925 --> 00:32:43,822
Welcome back, darling.

647
00:32:44,076 --> 00:32:46,182
So... what's on the agenda?

648
00:32:46,287 --> 00:32:47,921
We've got a wedding
to plan, lady.

649
00:32:48,027 --> 00:32:50,893
June 16th is right around the corner,
and I still have to get my shoes dyed.

650
00:32:50,925 --> 00:32:52,381
Actually, I changed
the wedding.

651
00:32:52,488 --> 00:32:54,483
Bradford and I aren't getting
married until november.

652
00:32:54,517 --> 00:32:56,772
What? But I thought
that you wanted...

653
00:32:58,178 --> 00:32:59,311
Willie.

654
00:32:59,417 --> 00:33:00,550
What?

655
00:33:00,707 --> 00:33:04,241
Did you give Fabia back the
16th in exchange for me?

656
00:33:04,345 --> 00:33:10,242
I just realized that my colors were
better suited for a fall wedding.

657
00:33:16,815 --> 00:33:19,990
- You did not just hug me.
- Of course I didn't.

658
00:33:26,376 --> 00:33:31,050
...and I never told anybody this,
but his name was Bill Cosby.

659
00:33:31,338 --> 00:33:32,552
You didn't.

660
00:33:32,668 --> 00:33:34,572
I have the audiotape
to prove it.

661
00:33:34,677 --> 00:33:37,271
He has a very
distinctive voice.

662
00:33:37,377 --> 00:33:38,532
You know...

663
00:33:39,095 --> 00:33:42,302
we've been talking
a lot about me.

664
00:33:42,936 --> 00:33:44,240
And it's been fun.

665
00:33:44,348 --> 00:33:46,540
Okay, so you wanna know
one of my secrets?

666
00:33:46,647 --> 00:33:48,682
You wanna kiss me, don't you?

667
00:33:48,925 --> 00:33:52,133
Back in Scotland,
I have a husband.

668
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:55,473
Ooh! You just got
10% more interesting.

669
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,020
He's an insurance auditor.

670
00:33:57,128 --> 00:33:59,823
- Okay, 5%.
- Oh, believe me, it was less.

671
00:33:59,928 --> 00:34:03,162
You know, the only time it got
exciting was when he'd come home drunk

672
00:34:03,266 --> 00:34:05,661
and he'd start throwing
the furniture around.

673
00:34:05,765 --> 00:34:08,451
So one morning, I woke up,

674
00:34:08,558 --> 00:34:10,732
I made Stuart his breakfast

675
00:34:10,835 --> 00:34:12,542
and off I went to the airport.

676
00:34:12,647 --> 00:34:16,860
To this day,
he has no idea where I am.

677
00:34:17,438 --> 00:34:20,580
There is so much more to
you than that accent.

678
00:34:21,886 --> 00:34:23,611
You can kiss me
now if you want to.

679
00:34:23,717 --> 00:34:25,701
God! You are all about sex,
aren't you?

680
00:34:25,805 --> 00:34:29,872
You do not have one secret
that's not about sex.

681
00:34:30,687 --> 00:34:32,371
Oh, no, I do have one.

682
00:34:32,706 --> 00:34:35,043
The woman who's room this is

683
00:34:35,598 --> 00:34:37,650
was a friend of my family's.

684
00:34:37,758 --> 00:34:41,801
What? You knew Fey Sommers
before you got this job?

685
00:34:41,908 --> 00:34:43,650
It's how I got this job.

686
00:34:43,756 --> 00:34:45,870
My dad handled her money,

687
00:34:45,976 --> 00:34:49,700
and he asked her to hook me
up after my acting career...

688
00:34:49,807 --> 00:34:52,941
hit a bit of a snag,
and voilà--

689
00:34:53,048 --> 00:34:56,932
the birth of lifetime
receptionist Amanda Tanen.

690
00:34:57,036 --> 00:34:59,191
We should toast to secrets.

691
00:35:01,946 --> 00:35:04,283
Oh! Empty.

692
00:35:07,008 --> 00:35:08,922
Up we go.

693
00:35:15,265 --> 00:35:17,060
Hello.

694
00:35:21,535 --> 00:35:23,772
Hey, how you doing?
I'm looking for something for my kid.

695
00:35:23,806 --> 00:35:25,862
He's, uh,
he's in the school play.

696
00:35:25,967 --> 00:35:27,840
I don't know,
like a--like a card or something.

697
00:35:27,858 --> 00:35:30,570
Hey, you know what? He's always
wanted those teeth whitening strips.

698
00:35:30,646 --> 00:35:32,673
We're all out. You should go.

699
00:35:34,027 --> 00:35:36,141
Oye, chico.
What are you talking about?

700
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:46,942
Don't move.

701
00:35:54,837 --> 00:35:57,283
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Try today's date.

702
00:35:57,385 --> 00:36:00,023
Why would Fey Sommers
use today's date?

703
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,492
You tell me!

704
00:36:01,598 --> 00:36:04,403
Okay, we've tried her birthday.
We tried her address.

705
00:36:04,747 --> 00:36:06,763
Ooh! Her measurements.

706
00:36:06,866 --> 00:36:08,642
- I don't know them.
- I do!

707
00:36:08,747 --> 00:36:10,320
Her real ones!

708
00:36:15,516 --> 00:36:18,021
Ooh, what's in there?
I want money and jewelry.

709
00:36:18,127 --> 00:36:19,101
It looks like her diary.

710
00:36:19,205 --> 00:36:21,800
Ugh, reading?
What else is there?

711
00:36:21,908 --> 00:36:24,700
Just a lot of photos.
Oh, look, who's the fat baby?

712
00:36:25,466 --> 00:36:26,763
Wait, that's me.

713
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:32,911
Why would Fey have pictures
of me in her safe?

714
00:36:33,315 --> 00:36:34,223
What?

715
00:36:34,327 --> 00:36:35,863
It's a birth certificate.

716
00:36:36,645 --> 00:36:38,973
It says Fey Sommers
was your mother.

717
00:37:04,036 --> 00:37:05,511
Excuse me, sir?

718
00:37:06,027 --> 00:37:09,312
Excuse me.
We have a situation back here.

719
00:37:09,418 --> 00:37:14,330
This woman is a diabetic, and she
is going into hypoglycemic shock.

720
00:37:14,638 --> 00:37:16,543
All right,
everybody stay seated.

721
00:37:16,646 --> 00:37:18,403
I'm coming back with a med kit.

722
00:37:20,756 --> 00:37:23,103
Okay... stay still.

723
00:37:24,748 --> 00:37:26,042
Let go of me!

724
00:37:26,247 --> 00:37:27,713
Get the damn gun!

725
00:37:27,816 --> 00:37:29,883
You're going to have to
stop struggling, sir,

726
00:37:29,988 --> 00:37:32,112
because this is happening!

727
00:37:35,767 --> 00:37:37,580
Okay, we're almost at
the hospital, Daniel.

728
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:38,953
Stay with me.

729
00:37:40,518 --> 00:37:43,110
You know,
I never wanted us to end up like this.

730
00:37:44,698 --> 00:37:46,583
I mean, you're my kid brother.

731
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:50,471
I don't know how all this
got so screwed up, but...

732
00:37:51,325 --> 00:37:54,040
I really want us to be
there for each other again.

733
00:37:56,655 --> 00:37:59,870
Wow, you're driving
really fast.

734
00:37:59,976 --> 00:38:02,090
Yeah, what's the
matter with these...

735
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,931
You should probably slow down.

736
00:38:04,926 --> 00:38:06,600
I can't.

737
00:38:09,666 --> 00:38:11,552
- Oh, my god! The brakes!
- What? What?

738
00:38:11,658 --> 00:38:14,933
Son of a bitch!
He cut the brakes on Bradford's car!

739
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:19,630
Oh, my god!

740
00:38:23,658 --> 00:38:26,140
# Could it be? #
# Yes, it could #

741
00:38:26,245 --> 00:38:28,710
# Something's coming #
# something good #

742
00:38:28,818 --> 00:38:31,383
# If I can wait #

743
00:38:31,486 --> 00:38:32,743
# Something's coming

744
00:38:32,847 --> 00:38:34,711
# I don't know what it is #

745
00:38:34,818 --> 00:38:38,823
# But it is gonna be great #

746
00:38:38,928 --> 00:38:41,512
# With a click #
# with a shock #

747
00:38:41,615 --> 00:38:44,161
# Phone'll jingle #
# door'll knock #

748
00:38:44,268 --> 00:38:46,691
# Open the latch #

749
00:38:46,796 --> 00:38:51,932
# Around the corner #

750
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:57,322
# Or whistling down the river #

751
00:38:57,425 --> 00:39:02,523
# Come on, deliver #

752
00:39:02,627 --> 00:39:07,092
# To me #

753
00:39:07,506 --> 00:39:09,900
# It's only just out of reach #

754
00:39:10,005 --> 00:39:11,920
# Down the block #
# on a beach #

755
00:39:12,028 --> 00:39:17,121
# Maybe tonight #

756
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,062
Hurry up!

757
00:39:22,225 --> 00:39:23,572
Don't hurt him!

758
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:49,662
I need the gate number for the
9:00 flight to Tucson, please.

759
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:51,580
Just one more minute!

760
00:39:54,828 --> 00:39:56,970
I'm sorry,
I thought you were my cab.

761
00:39:57,808 --> 00:39:59,972
I'm looking for a Hilda Suarez.

762
00:40:05,635 --> 00:40:08,581
Flight attendants,
please prepare for departure.

763
00:40:22,115 --> 00:40:24,180
I didn't believe hard enough.

764
00:40:24,286 --> 00:40:26,592
Loving is enough.

765
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:29,281
Not here.

766
00:40:29,456 --> 00:40:31,450
They won't let us be.

767
00:40:32,397 --> 00:40:34,522
Then we'll get away.

768
00:40:35,415 --> 00:40:37,501
Yes, we can.

769
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:39,690
We will.

770
00:40:54,148 --> 00:40:55,960
There was a gun.

771
00:40:56,135 --> 00:41:00,742
# Hold my hand #
# and we're halfway there... #

772
00:41:01,697 --> 00:41:07,220
# Hold my hand #
# and I'll take you there... #

773
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:11,371
No, Betty! No! No!
No! No! No! No!

774
00:41:11,478 --> 00:41:14,410
# Someday #

775
00:41:14,985 --> 00:41:21,291
# Somewhere #

776
00:41:27,168 --> 00:41:29,963
