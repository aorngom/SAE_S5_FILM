1
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,202
Oh, How Weird.

2
00:00:14,399 --> 00:00:16,779
We're Always, Just, Like,
Running Into Each Other.

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,843
Hey, Jesse. Hi. Hey.

4
00:00:22,432 --> 00:00:24,757
Oh, Hi! Oh, It's So Funny.

5
00:00:24,757 --> 00:00:26,770
We're Always Just, Like,
Running Into Each Other.

6
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,130
Hey, Betty Rocker.
I Guess We're Just, Uh,

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,526
Two Ships
That Pass In The Morning.

8
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:38,814
How Was Work Last Night? Uh, 34
Bucks In Tips And The Cook Spit On Me.

9
00:00:38,814 --> 00:00:40,354
Why Are You Always Up
So Early?

10
00:00:40,354 --> 00:00:44,579
Oh, Uh, Work. Just So Much
To Do. Gotta Get An Early Start.

11
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,200
Want Some Coffee? The Guy
At The Shop, He Gave Me Two.

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,178
It's Decaf, 'Cause I Know You
Have To Sleep In The Morning.

13
00:00:49,178 --> 00:00:50,952
I Mean, He Knows That You Sleep
In The Morning.

14
00:00:50,952 --> 00:00:54,794
It Was Just A Coincidence. Hey, Oh,
I Knocked On Your Door Last Night.

15
00:00:54,794 --> 00:00:57,804
You Weren't There, But I-I Wanted
To Give You Something. Really?

16
00:00:57,804 --> 00:01:00,348
Yeah, It's A Couple New Songs
From My Band.

17
00:01:00,512 --> 00:01:04,073
I- I Think It's Pretty Good.
O- Or It Sucks. I Don't Know.

18
00:01:04,073 --> 00:01:05,703
But Listen,
You Have To Be Brutal,

19
00:01:05,703 --> 00:01:07,543
'Cause You're Always
Way Too Nice To Me.

20
00:01:07,543 --> 00:01:10,971
No, No. That's Just Because
I Always Like 'Em, You Know?

21
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:13,833
Your-Your Music Is So...
Emotional.

22
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:17,586
And That Song "I Made Her Cry"?
It Made Me Cry.

23
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,626
You're Sweet.

24
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:21,693
Oh, Hey. Um,
Do You Know If They Fixed

25
00:01:21,726 --> 00:01:23,693
The Tv
In The Laundry Room Yet?

26
00:01:23,726 --> 00:01:26,060
'Cause There's A Miles Davis Documentary Tonight
- I Have A Tv.

27
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,725
I Mean, You Don't Have To Watch
It In The Laundry Room.

28
00:01:28,725 --> 00:01:30,001
You Could Just Come Over.

29
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:31,619
You Know, I'll Be Home
Just Doing Stuff,

30
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,819
So Knock Or Whatever.
All Right, Thanks. I Will.

31
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:35,849
Okay.

32
00:01:40,846 --> 00:01:42,087
So You're Going To Work?

33
00:01:42,087 --> 00:01:43,996
Yes. Yes.

34
00:01:45,013 --> 00:01:47,612
Oh. That Way.

Oh, My God! Betty. I
Thought I Heard Something.

37
00:02:10,813 --> 00:02:12,779
What Are You Doing Here?

38
00:02:12,813 --> 00:02:15,180
Um, I'm Starting Work
A Little Early.

39
00:02:15,213 --> 00:02:16,782
Me, Too.
You're Naked.

40
00:02:16,782 --> 00:02:19,298
And You're Wearing
A Hideous Ensemble,

41
00:02:19,298 --> 00:02:21,177
But I'm Not All About
The Obvious. Amanda.

42
00:02:21,177 --> 00:02:24,879
Okay, Stop Grilling Me.
I Kind Of Got A Little Evicted.

43
00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:28,458
What? How? Can You Just
Put Something On, Please?

44
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,213
I Didn't Pay My Rent
A Couple Times,

45
00:02:32,246 --> 00:02:35,818
And They Got So Nasty About It.
Well, Amanda, You Can't Live Here.

46
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,632
You Must Have, Like, A Hundred
Friends You Could Stay With.

47
00:02:38,632 --> 00:02:41,510
You-Do You Need Some Money?
Betty, Please Stop Caretaking.

48
00:02:41,847 --> 00:02:44,984
God, It's Like A Disease
With You. And I'm Fine Here.

49
00:02:45,184 --> 00:02:47,453
One Of The Boys In Security
Takes Care Of Me,

50
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,261
And I Take Care Of Him.
Hey, Zander.

51
00:02:56,249 --> 00:03:03,858
* Blind Girl,
Can't You See My Love? *

52
00:03:04,174 --> 00:03:07,038
* Try To Tell You,
Try To Show You, Try To- *

53
00:03:07,038 --> 00:03:08,248
Hi.

54
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:10,390
You Were, Um, Singing?

55
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,152
This Is My Friend Jesse's
New Song. It's Really Good.

56
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:15,178
Jesse-I've Been
Hearing That Name A Lot.

57
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:17,903
Whatever Happened
To No Romantic Entanglements?

58
00:03:17,903 --> 00:03:20,945
Wasn't That The Rule?
Yes, It's Still The Rule.

59
00:03:20,945 --> 00:03:22,881
Now Can We Please Talk About
The Fashion Heats Up Party?

60
00:03:22,881 --> 00:03:24,732
Because We Still
Don't Have A Band.

61
00:03:24,732 --> 00:03:26,099
And M.I.A.'S People
Just Called.

62
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:27,842
Apparently,
She's On Vacation In Brazil.

63
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:29,423
No One Can Get Ahold Of Her.

64
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,122
Ooh.
Looks Like Connor's Here.

65
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:35,821
Man, He Is So Cool.

66
00:03:35,821 --> 00:03:39,072
Hiring Him Is The Smartest Thing I've Ever
Done. Yeah, Just Wait Till Wilhelmina Finds Out

67
00:03:39,072 --> 00:03:43,310
You Tricked Her To Get Him Here. Come On,
Betty. I'm Tired Of Her Walking All Over Me.

68
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,205
I Need As Many People
On Team Daniel As I Can Get.

69
00:03:46,238 --> 00:03:49,197
Besides, We Needed Someone
To Run The Financial Arm Of This Company. Connor's The Best.

70
00:03:49,197 --> 00:03:51,112
Well, As A Member Of Team Daniel,

71
00:03:51,112 --> 00:03:54,929
I Fully Support You. Besides, Everyone
Here Loves Him. It's Always Been That Way.

72
00:03:54,929 --> 00:03:57,086
At Harvard,
He Was A Rock Star-

73
00:03:57,086 --> 00:03:59,937
Captain Of The Crew Team,
All The Girls Loved Him.

74
00:04:00,662 --> 00:04:02,543
Man, He Got A Lot Of...

75
00:04:02,862 --> 00:04:05,402
Uh, Ahem. All The Girls
Really Loved Him.

76
00:04:08,395 --> 00:04:11,503
This Is Why I Hate Women,
Marc. They're Weak.

77
00:04:11,503 --> 00:04:13,934
Ugh. Look At Them
Throwing Themselves At Him.

78
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:16,962
Although, I Would Love To Live
In His Pants For A Year.

79
00:04:16,996 --> 00:04:18,715
Ugh. You're All Fools.

80
00:04:18,862 --> 00:04:20,478
The Only Thing
That Matters Is That

81
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,234
The New Chief Financial Officer
Loathes Daniel Meade,

82
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:27,276
Which Means
I'll Have An Ally.

83
00:04:27,276 --> 00:04:29,480
So If It's You
Against Daniel...

84
00:04:29,762 --> 00:04:32,273
He'll Always Agree With Me.

85
00:04:32,274 --> 00:04:34,052
I Have To Agree With Daniel.

86
00:04:34,996 --> 00:04:36,362
Again?

87
00:04:36,395 --> 00:04:39,679
Well, Shooting In The Caribbean
Is Just More Cost Efficient,

88
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,434
And As Daniel's
Already Pointed Out-

89
00:04:41,434 --> 00:04:45,113
Ugh. Yes, Yes, Yes, Daniel Has
Had So Many Great Ideas Today.

90
00:04:45,424 --> 00:04:47,277
I Guess I'm Just Lucky.

91
00:04:47,277 --> 00:04:50,462
Wilhelmina, I'm Just Giving You
My Honest Opinion.

92
00:04:50,495 --> 00:04:52,888
There Simply Aren't The Funds
For Your Proposal.

93
00:04:52,888 --> 00:04:54,704
Well, Then Find The Funds.

94
00:04:55,485 --> 00:04:57,765
Okay, I'm Going To Be Blunt.

95
00:04:58,105 --> 00:05:00,686
This Company Owns
Too Many Magazines.

96
00:05:00,686 --> 00:05:03,570
Now If You Want To Funnel
More Money Into "Mode,"

97
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,980
I Suggest You Have A Look

98
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,702
At Selling Off Some Of Your Titles.
Finally... An Idea I Can Agree With.

99
00:05:08,702 --> 00:05:11,064
Now I Have A Very Strong
Relationship With Cond?Nast.

100
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:13,468
I Think There May Be Interest
In A Sale.

101
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:16,318
No. We Are Not Selling Off
A Single Magazine.

102
00:05:16,468 --> 00:05:19,876
They're A Part Of My Father's Legacy.
That's Ridiculous. Connor, Come On.

103
00:05:22,902 --> 00:05:24,867
It May Be Too Drastic.

104
00:05:24,868 --> 00:05:27,452
I'll Explore Other Options.

105
00:05:28,543 --> 00:05:29,976
Excuse Me.

106
00:05:34,436 --> 00:05:36,535
Why Are You Two So Chummy?

107
00:05:36,568 --> 00:05:38,214
What The Hell
Is Going On Here?

108
00:05:39,682 --> 00:05:41,890
I Think
What's Going On, Wilhelmina,

109
00:05:42,763 --> 00:05:44,485
Is You've Been Played.

110
00:05:46,752 --> 00:05:48,766
Why Don't You Try
One Of Connor's Doughnuts?

111
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:50,211
They're Really Good.

112
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:57,936
Okay, I've Got Chips And Dip

113
00:05:58,186 --> 00:06:00,938
And Carrot Sticks, You Know,
In Case He's That Guy.

114
00:06:00,938 --> 00:06:03,906
Now Should I Light Candles
Or Is That Too Romantic?

115
00:06:03,938 --> 00:06:06,639
But Maybe I Like Candles.
Maybe I'm That Girl.

116
00:06:06,672 --> 00:06:09,317
If He Could Be That Guy,
I Could Be That Girl, Right?

117
00:06:09,317 --> 00:06:12,672
Ooh! You Are Crushing Hard.

118
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,338
Yes, Maybe I Like Him,

119
00:06:14,372 --> 00:06:17,338
But What Are The Chances
That He's Gonna Like Me Back?

120
00:06:17,372 --> 00:06:19,839
Oh, Stop It. Henry And Gio
Were Crazy About You.

121
00:06:19,872 --> 00:06:22,105
That Was Different.
Jesse's An Artist.

122
00:06:22,138 --> 00:06:24,338
He Writes Music, Hilda,

123
00:06:24,372 --> 00:06:28,071
And I Get So Dorky When I'm
Around Him. Honey, Please.

124
00:06:28,105 --> 00:06:30,290
He's Always Asking
You To Listen To His Music.

125
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,953
If A Guy Needs You To Tell Him
How Great He Is, He Likes You.

126
00:06:34,138 --> 00:06:36,041
Really?
Yeah.

127
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,906
I Don't Know.

128
00:06:37,938 --> 00:06:39,405
Aunt Betty?
Yeah?

129
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:42,030
It's Not That I Don't Love
What You're Wearing Right Now-

130
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,906
It's Very You-

131
00:06:43,938 --> 00:06:46,605
But, Um, Maybe For Tonight,
We Can Go A Little Simpler.

132
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,865
Okay. Thank You So Much
For Coming.

133
00:06:48,865 --> 00:06:50,585
It Was So Sweet Of You Guys
To Help...

134
00:06:50,585 --> 00:06:52,743
But He's Gonna Be Here
Any Minute, So Get Out.

135
00:06:52,743 --> 00:06:55,360
Okay. Okay. I Love You.
Okay, But I'm Telling You, Re-

136
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,867
Mwah. Bye.
Okay. Okay, Bye.

137
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:58,229
Okay, Bye.

138
00:07:14,971 --> 00:07:16,252
Coming!

139
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:21,923
Hi!

140

Do You Have A Boy
Coming Over?

146
00:07:46,324 --> 00:07:47,890
Wait. It Is A Boy, Right?
'Cause I Need To Know

147
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:51,645
These Things If We're Gonna Be Roomies.
Um, Amanda, You Can't Stay Here.

148
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:55,541
Why? You Said I Should Stay With A
Friend. Yeah, But I Meant, Like, Marc.

To Jeopardize That Friendship.</I>

00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,650
Okay. You Know What?
I Would Love To Help You,

152
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,687
But Right Now Is
Not A Very Good Time.

153
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:07,271
But, Betty,
I Have Nowhere Else To Go.

154
00:08:07,582 --> 00:08:10,800
Believe It Or Not,
I Don't Have That Many Friends.

155
00:08:10,996 --> 00:08:13,162
Girls Just Don't Seem
To Like Me.

156
00:08:13,537 --> 00:08:15,803
And You Were So Nice To Me
This Morning.

157
00:08:16,146 --> 00:08:18,471
I Figured You Wouldn't Mind,
Because, You Know,

158
00:08:18,504 --> 00:08:19,970
You're Betty.

159
00:08:20,004 --> 00:08:21,713
You're A Nice Person.

160
00:08:24,663 --> 00:08:25,738
Hey.

161
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:29,173
Hey. So Bad News.
I Have To Cancel Tonight.

162
00:08:29,471 --> 00:08:32,504
This Friend Of Mine-
Or Person Of Mine-

163
00:08:32,537 --> 00:08:34,504
Is Having Some Hard Times.
I-

164
00:08:34,537 --> 00:08:36,004
No, That's Totally Cool,

165
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:38,944
'Cause I Probably Wouldn't Have
Been Good Company Anyway.

166
00:08:38,944 --> 00:08:41,753
You Know, We Just Lost This Gig
To Another Band, Buffalo Hump.

167
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:44,504
You Know Those Guys?
No, Can't Say I Do.

168
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:48,578
They Suck. Oh, I'm Sorry,
Jesse, But Don't Be Discouraged.

169
00:08:48,578 --> 00:08:50,412
Your Band Is So Great.

170
00:08:50,412 --> 00:08:53,100
It's Just A Matter Of Time
Before It Takes Off.

171
00:08:54,237 --> 00:08:55,991
Well, You Know What's So Cool
About You?

172
00:08:55,991 --> 00:08:58,701
I... I Really Feel
Like You Mean That.

173
00:08:58,856 --> 00:09:00,773
Thanks, B.
You Have A Good Night.

174
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:01,959
Okay. You, Too.

175
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,940
Betty,
We're Out Of The Dip...

176
00:09:04,973 --> 00:09:06,637
And I'm Hungry.

177
00:09:07,773 --> 00:09:11,422
Dude, I Have To Say,
It's Good To Have You Here.

178
00:09:11,422 --> 00:09:13,948
I Think We're Gonna
Make A Great Team.

179
00:09:13,948 --> 00:09:17,206
Me, Too. Oh, I Put Together
A List Of Ideas To Cut Costs-

180
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:19,540
Small Things,
But I Think They Add Up.

181
00:09:19,573 --> 00:09:21,541
You Don't Have
To Run Everything By Me.

182
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:24,719
Do What You Think Is Best.
I Know You Got My Back.

183
00:09:25,582 --> 00:09:26,840
We're Bros.

184
00:09:28,373 --> 00:09:31,336
Ugh. I Hate
That Stupid Fist Bump.

185
00:09:31,873 --> 00:09:33,373
Talk To Me.

186
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,373
I've Been Over And Over
Connor's Contract.

187
00:09:35,406 --> 00:09:37,960
<I>You Can't Get Rid Of Him
Without A Huge Buyout.</I>

188
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,747
Oh, I Put That In There To Screw
Daniel, Not Me. So What Are We Gonna Do?

189
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,739
Get Some Dirt On Connor Owens,
Something I Can Use As Leverage.

190
00:09:44,739 --> 00:09:46,651
I Will Not Be
Constantly Overruled

191
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:49,286
By Two Silly White Boys.
I'm On It.

192
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,147
Oh, My God.

193
00:10:03,147 --> 00:10:05,214
We Totally Match.

194
00:10:07,872 --> 00:10:11,267
You And I Are
Going To Have So Much Fun.

195
00:10:11,546 --> 00:10:14,047
* Merrymaking
* Come Into My House

196
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,546
* You're Invited Into My House

197
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,246
Is That My Lunch?

198
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,147
Oh. Oh, Sorry.

199
00:10:19,147 --> 00:10:21,579
Halston, Save Some For Betty.

200
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,123
* Come Into My House,
You're Invited Into My House *

201
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:26,747
* Merrymaking

202
00:10:28,147 --> 00:10:30,414
I Can't Sleep. Oh.

203
00:10:31,947 --> 00:10:34,129
What Do You Want Me
To Do About It?

204
00:10:34,313 --> 00:10:35,780
Sometimes It Helps

205
00:10:35,813 --> 00:10:38,067
If You Tickle My Back
And Tell Me I'm Pretty.

206
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,847
* At My Place, Baby,
At My Place *

207
00:10:43,246 --> 00:10:45,813
You Tickled Her Back?
That's A Little Bit Weird.

208
00:10:45,847 --> 00:10:49,158
I Had No Choice. Christina,
I Needed To Get Some Sleep.

209
00:10:49,158 --> 00:10:51,503
I Get It. I've Done A Lot Worse
Things To Get Some Sleep.

210
00:10:51,503 --> 00:10:55,279
Believe Me. Betty, You're Gonna
Have To Kick Her Out.

211
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:57,956
But She's Got No Money.
Well, I Don't Like

212
00:10:57,956 --> 00:11:00,680
The Way She's Interfering
With Your Social Life.

213
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,932
I Want You To Take This Crush
On To The Next Level. I Knew It.

214
00:11:03,932 --> 00:11:06,150
Betty Has A Crush. It's Someone
From The Building, Right?

215
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,583
You're Always
Darting In And Out,

216
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,732
All Sweaty And Mysterious. Amanda,
It Is None Of Your Business.

217
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:14,411
Are You Wearing My Leggings?
It's Cute, Right?

218
00:11:14,617 --> 00:11:16,515
And The Other Leg Makes
A Matching Scarf.

219
00:11:16,515 --> 00:11:20,665
I Have To Say, I Don't Hate It. Well...
Ooh. Ooh. I Know Who Your Lover Is.

220
00:11:20,665 --> 00:11:23,677
It's That Troll From 3g Who Walks His Guinea Pig
On A Leash.

221
00:11:23,677 --> 00:11:25,436
When Are You Two Crazy Kids
Gonna Go Out?

222
00:11:25,631 --> 00:11:27,533
It's Not The Guy
With The Guinea Pig,

223
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:29,195
And I'm Not Going Out
With Anybody,

224
00:11:29,195 --> 00:11:32,346
Because I Don't Even Know
If This Guy Likes Me.

225
00:11:32,346 --> 00:11:34,592
Here's What You Do.
Invite Him To The "Mode" Party.

226
00:11:34,592 --> 00:11:37,559
<I>It'll Be Totally Casz. That's A Good
Idea. There'll Be Loads Of People There,</I>

227
00:11:37,592 --> 00:11:40,559
And It Won't Even Feel Like A Date. And
If He Turns Out To Be A Serial Killer,

228
00:11:40,592 --> 00:11:43,007
He Can Just Find Someone Else
To Cut Into Pieces.

229
00:11:43,196 --> 00:11:44,508
You're Welcome.

230
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,226
So What Do You Think?

231
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,747
I Think I'm Gonna Ask Jesse
To The "Mode" Party.

232
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:53,459
Ooh!
Stop.

233
00:11:55,862 --> 00:11:57,692
Hey There, Sexy.

234
00:11:57,726 --> 00:11:59,260
Hey, Big Tiny.

235
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:02,292
Uh, Can We Please Work
On A Better Nickname For Me?

236
00:12:02,325 --> 00:12:05,959
Why? It's Cute. So After Work,
Let's Meet At Prune,

237
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:08,573
Because If I Don't Get
A Parsley And Dandelion Salad,

238
00:12:08,573 --> 00:12:10,900
I Swear To Barbra
I Am Going To Throw A Fit

239
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,771
With The Fury Of A Thousand
Queens. Move In With Me.

240
00:12:13,771 --> 00:12:15,134
What? What Did-
What Did You Say?

241
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,207
Move... In... With... Me.

242
00:12:19,242 --> 00:12:22,459
I Mean, We Spend
All Our Time Together Anyway.

243
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,459
I Mean, Doesn't It
Just Make Sense?

244
00:12:24,492 --> 00:12:26,793
Um, We Should Definitely
Talk About That,

245
00:12:26,826 --> 00:12:29,322
Because It Definitely Bears
Further Discussion.

246
00:12:30,492 --> 00:12:32,260
Ahem.
Marc!

247
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:35,390
Coming, Willie. Oh, My God. This
Day Could Not Get Any Crazier.

248
00:12:35,826 --> 00:12:37,482
Busy. Busy. Busy. Busy. Busy.

249
00:12:37,482 --> 00:12:39,618
There's Just So Much To Do.
In Fact, I Don't Even Know

250
00:12:39,618 --> 00:12:41,459
If I'm Gonna Be Able
To Do Dinner Tonight.

251
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:43,701
Well, We'll-We'll, Uh,
We'll-We'll-We'll Talk Later

252
00:12:43,701 --> 00:12:46,733
Or-Or Tomorrow,
And, Um, Okay.

253
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,956
Hi, Jesse.

254
00:12:56,989 --> 00:12:59,323
Hey.
I Was Just Thinking About You.

255
00:12:59,356 --> 00:13:00,790
Really? Why?

256
00:13:00,824 --> 00:13:03,790
Well, Um,
I Was Thinking About You

257
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:07,457
Because I Was Wondering, Um...
Yeah?

258
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:10,345
"Mode" Is Having This Party
For Global Warming.

259
00:13:10,345 --> 00:13:12,022
Oh, It's Not
For Global Warming Obviously,

260
00:13:12,022 --> 00:13:13,276
'Cause Global Warming Is Bad.

261
00:13:13,276 --> 00:13:14,822
It's For Awareness. Yay!

262
00:13:14,822 --> 00:13:17,224
Anyway, Um, I'm In Charge
Of Finding The Band.

263
00:13:17,224 --> 00:13:20,674
It's Gonna Be Fun, And So I Was Thinking
- If I Could Play?

264
00:13:20,994 --> 00:13:23,224
You Want Dark Sexual Journey
To Play At A "Mode" Party?

265
00:13:23,224 --> 00:13:26,025
Oh, My-This Is Amazing.
Oh, No, Jesse. I Think That-

266
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:28,692
Do You Know What Kind
Of Exposure This Will Be For Us,

267
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:32,224
For-For Me? You're The Coolest
Girl Ever! Oh. Um, Uh...

268
00:13:32,258 --> 00:13:34,176
Oh. Oh, My God.

269
00:13:34,176 --> 00:13:37,231
Betty, I-I Was Just
So Depressed Today, You Know?

270
00:13:37,231 --> 00:13:39,103
Like, I Was, Like,
This Close To Just...

271
00:13:39,491 --> 00:13:41,625
Uh, Whatever.
I'll Put It In A Song,

272
00:13:41,658 --> 00:13:45,387
But Oh, My-You Really,
Really Cheered Me Up.

273
00:13:45,387 --> 00:13:48,176
I Mean,
You're A Snow Day, Betty.

274
00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:58,544
Hey, Daniel. Good News.

275
00:13:58,544 --> 00:14:01,370
We're No Longer Bandless.I Found Someone To Play At The Party
On Friday. 

276
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,597
You Know What? Already Done.

277
00:14:02,725 --> 00:14:05,193
Guess What?
We Got Mariah Carey.

278
00:14:05,342 --> 00:14:07,588
It Turns Out Connor Knows Her.
Isn't That Great?

279
00:14:10,464 --> 00:14:12,431
Yeah, I Mean,
Mariah's All Right,

280
00:14:12,464 --> 00:14:14,895
But Can We Just Put A Pin In Her
For A Second?

281
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,395
Because I Think
I Found Someone Way Fresher-

282
00:14:17,931 --> 00:14:20,419
Jesse's Band,
Dark Sexual Journey.

283
00:14:21,054 --> 00:14:23,568
Huh. They're Awesome, And They're
About To Break Out Any Minute.

284
00:14:23,568 --> 00:14:24,670
You'll Love Them.

285
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,514
Okay, Um, Great. Yeah. Let Me
Just Get Mariah On The Phone.

286
00:14:29,254 --> 00:14:31,125
Hey, Mariah. It's Daniel.

287
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,039
Yeah, It Turns Out We're
Not Gonna Need You To Sing.

288
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:36,740
Uh-Huh. We Got Jesse, The Guy
From My Assistant's Building.

289
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,722
He Is So Cute. Yes,
He Is Just The Dreamiest.

290
00:14:39,722 --> 00:14:41,993
I Hate When You're Sarcastic.

291
00:14:42,952 --> 00:14:45,286
I Can't Move In With Cliff,
Right?

292
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:47,286
I Mean, This Is
Just Such A Big Step.

293
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,553
Sometimes I Think,
I Love This Guy,

294
00:14:49,586 --> 00:14:52,112
And Then Sometimes I Think,
What Am I Doing With Him?

295
00:14:52,112 --> 00:14:55,033
Am I Terrible?
No, Baby, You're Just Scared.

296
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:59,169
I Am. Look, All I Know Is That
Living With A Fatty Is Hard.

297
00:14:59,169 --> 00:15:02,336
Mm. They're Always Hogging
The Bed And Making A Mess

298
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:04,635
And Borrowing Your Clothes.
By The Way, Loving This Dress.

299
00:15:04,668 --> 00:15:06,666
It's Betty's Blouse.
I Totally Belted It.

300
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:07,904
It's Great.
Right?

301
00:15:13,035 --> 00:15:14,435
Is It Good?

302
00:15:14,603 --> 00:15:16,802
Very.
I Made A Few Calls,

303
00:15:16,835 --> 00:15:18,162
Cashed In A Few Favors-

304
00:15:18,162 --> 00:15:19,910
Oh, Yeah. Right. Sorry.
You're Not About The Process.

305
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,729
There's Lots Of Juicy Tidbits
About Connor's Past.

306
00:15:24,302 --> 00:15:25,633
Oh, Females.

307
00:15:26,114 --> 00:15:28,271
Have Connor Come To My Office
After Work.

308
00:15:28,681 --> 00:15:30,243
I Think I Can Make
A Persuasive Argument

309
00:15:30,243 --> 00:15:32,711
As To Whom He Should
Be Aligning Himself With.

310
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:37,835
I Don't Think You've Got
Any Choice, Betty,

311
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:39,336
But To Tell The Truth.

312
00:15:39,369 --> 00:15:41,336
He Can't Play At The Party.

313
00:15:41,369 --> 00:15:43,914
I Know. Two Shawarmas
With Everything, Please.

314
00:15:44,293 --> 00:15:46,529
But You Should Have Seen
His Little Face.

315
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,792
Oh.
He's Gonna Be So Disappointed,

316
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:51,377
And He's Gonna Hate Me Before
I Even Know If He Likes Me. Oh-

317
00:15:51,377 --> 00:15:54,765
Bring It. Who's Gonna Hate You?
No One. Why Are You Always Around?

318
00:15:54,902 --> 00:15:57,266
Betty, We're Roomies Now.
This Is What We Do.

319
00:15:57,266 --> 00:15:59,242
I'm Supposed To Be
All Up In Your Biz.

320
00:15:59,242 --> 00:16:03,231
So Why The Brown Face? Oh, Betty
Told This Boy That She Really Likes

321
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:04,831
That He Could Play
At The "Mode" Party,

322
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,759
But Daniel Got Mariah Carey.

323
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:10,005
What? Well, She's Gonna Find Out
Sooner Or Later, Isn't She?

324
00:16:10,005 --> 00:16:13,939
Yes, I Will. So It's A Musician?
Are You Wearing My Blouse?

325
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:16,427
Don't Change The Subject.
Here's What You Do-

326
00:16:16,427 --> 00:16:19,894
Invite Him To Play At The After
Party. There Aren't Any After Parties.

327
00:16:19,927 --> 00:16:23,027
Um, What About The One
We Are Having On Our Roof?

328
00:16:23,061 --> 00:16:25,927
It Totally Just Came To Me. Your
Guy Will Have A Place To Play,

329
00:16:25,961 --> 00:16:27,740
And I Can Charge Money
At The Door

330
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,301
And Pay Off My Credit Cards.

331
00:16:29,301 --> 00:16:31,730
Aren't You So Glad
That I Moved In?

332
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,106
Bye.

333
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:39,422
Damn It!

334
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,027
You Okay?

335
00:16:42,061 --> 00:16:43,769
No, I'm Wet.

336
00:16:44,694 --> 00:16:47,027
Why Did You Replace
Our Nice Bottled Water

337
00:16:47,061 --> 00:16:49,593
With Glasses We Now Have
To Fill Ourselves?

338
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:51,793
Why Don't You Just Hang
A Hamster Bottle In The Corner

339
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:53,793
And We Can All Take Turns
Sipping Off Of It?

340
00:16:53,793 --> 00:16:55,398
Mom, Relax, Okay?

341
00:16:55,688 --> 00:16:57,986
It's Probably Just One Of
Connor's Cost-Cutting Ideas.

342
00:16:57,986 --> 00:16:59,501
Oh, Like That Memo Telling Us

343
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:01,446
We Now Have To Sign Out A Key
For The Supply Room?

344
00:17:01,446 --> 00:17:05,834
Is That Connor's Idea As Well? I Told Him
He Didn't Have To Run Everything By Me.

345
00:17:05,834 --> 00:17:08,253
You Be Careful, Daniel.
This Is A Pattern With You.

346
00:17:08,253 --> 00:17:10,632
Whenever You Admire Someone, You
Tend To Give Your Power Away,

347
00:17:10,832 --> 00:17:14,991
Just Like You Did With Your Brother. That's
Not True, And That's Beside The Point.

348
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:17,290
I Hired Connor
Because He's The Best,

349
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:21,458
And Because I Can Trust Him. That's
Good. Then I Suppose You're Not Worried

350
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,432
That He And Wilhelmina
Are Meeting Together Tonight,

351
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:24,817
Privately.

352
00:17:26,374 --> 00:17:27,606
Or Did You Not Know That?

353
00:17:28,524 --> 00:17:31,733
You See, I Make It A Point

354
00:17:31,783 --> 00:17:34,791
To Know Everything
Wilhelmina Slater Is Up To,

355
00:17:35,251 --> 00:17:39,184
And If They're Meeting Alone,
I Don't Like It.

356
00:17:39,217 --> 00:17:41,710
There Are A Million Reasons
Why They Could Be Meeting.

357
00:17:42,004 --> 00:17:43,416
Don't Worry.

358
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,571
Connor's Got My Back.

359
00:17:54,967 --> 00:17:56,352
What Is This?

360
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,773
It Looks Like A Flyer
For A Rodeo At A Women's Prison.

361
00:17:59,773 --> 00:18:01,737
What? I Like It.

362
00:18:01,737 --> 00:18:03,799
Betty, No One Will Come
To A Party

363
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,313
With A Flyer Like This.

364
00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:08,315
Fine. How Would You Do It?

365
00:18:09,985 --> 00:18:12,067
<I>But How Will People Know
Where To Go?</I>

366
00:18:12,067 --> 00:18:15,274
They Won't Even Know What Time To Show
Up. If They Want To Be There Badly Enough,

367
00:18:15,274 --> 00:18:16,676
They'll Figure All That Out.

368
00:18:16,676 --> 00:18:18,383
You Have To Make It Hard
To Get On The List.

369
00:18:18,383 --> 00:18:20,859
That Way, The Party Will Be Full
Of People Desperate To Be There,

370
00:18:20,859 --> 00:18:22,274
And They'll Think It's Great,
No Matter How Much

371
00:18:22,274 --> 00:18:26,254
Of A Humongous Turd It Turns
Out To Be. Um, I Don't Know.

372
00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:29,313
Trust Me, Roomie.

373
00:18:30,302 --> 00:18:33,668
* All Of The Boys
And The Girls Here In Paris *

374
00:18:33,702 --> 00:18:35,345
* Sing To The Night#

375
00:18:35,345 --> 00:18:37,854
* Without Sight
But With Madness *

376
00:18:37,854 --> 00:18:41,538
* I Can't Keep Up,
I'm A Wreck, But I Want It *

377
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:45,719
* Tell Me The Truth,
Is It Love Or Just Paris? *

378
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:49,402
* All Of The Boys And The Girls
Here In Paris *

379
00:18:49,436 --> 00:18:51,535
* Sing To The Night
Without Sight *

380
00:18:52,027 --> 00:18:54,802
* But With Madness

381
00:18:56,062 --> 00:18:58,953
300 People. Cool, Right?

382
00:18:58,953 --> 00:19:01,668
Wow.
That Is A Lot Of People.

383
00:19:01,702 --> 00:19:03,355
Yes, It Is.

384
00:19:06,322 --> 00:19:08,442
I'm Glad
We're Gonna Have This Chance

385
00:19:08,442 --> 00:19:10,197
To Get To Know Each Other
Better, Connor.

386
00:19:10,368 --> 00:19:13,488
I Find It Helps Improve
A Work Relationship.

387
00:19:13,522 --> 00:19:15,843
Me, Too. Good, 'Cause,
You Know, I'm Confused.

388
00:19:15,843 --> 00:19:19,350
I Was, Um, I Was Led To Believe
That You And Daniel-

389
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,370
Just How Bad Is
That Headache?

390
00:19:21,544 --> 00:19:22,600
I'm Sorry?

391
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,473
Oh, You've Been Doing That...
A Lot.

392
00:19:25,473 --> 00:19:27,807
Well, It's Been Quite A Day.

393
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,835
I Can Get Rid Of That For You.

394
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,874
No, Thank You. That's What
Drugs Are For. Come On.

395
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,801
Let Me.
I'm Better For Your Liver.

396
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,407
You Know Why You Get Them?

397
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,257
Too Many Ideas In Your Head

398
00:19:42,257 --> 00:19:44,695
And Not Enough Time In The Day
To Get Them Out.

399
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,396
Even If You Could,

400
00:19:46,396 --> 00:19:48,451
Who Would You Trust Them With?

401
00:19:49,245 --> 00:19:50,535
That's A Lot Of Pressure,

402
00:19:50,535 --> 00:19:52,682
Having Only Yourself
To Depend On.

403
00:19:54,071 --> 00:19:57,217
I Get Headaches, Too.
There.

404
00:19:57,217 --> 00:19:58,816
So How Is It?

405
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,536
It's Gone.

406
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:06,345
Good. Shall We Continue
Our Talk?

407
00:20:06,674 --> 00:20:08,010
Now...

408
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,320
My Guess Is
A Woman Such As Yourself

409
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,919
Would Have A Bottle
Of '61 Single Malt Scotch

410
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,604
Floating Around The Place
Somewhere.

411
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,582
Um, '48.

412
00:20:19,582 --> 00:20:21,991
Perfect.
Older Is Always Better.

413
00:20:22,278 --> 00:20:23,637
I Wouldn't Know.

414
00:20:23,637 --> 00:20:25,508
I've Been The Same Age
For Years.

415
00:20:25,873 --> 00:20:28,577
You Know, Wilhelmina,
You're The Reason I'm Here.

416
00:20:30,256 --> 00:20:31,855
Something Tells Me

417
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,403
I Could Learn A Lot From You.

418
00:20:42,657 --> 00:20:47,238
* I Been Really Tryin', Baby

419
00:20:47,238 --> 00:20:53,878
* Tryin' To Hold Back
This Feelin' For So Long *

420
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:56,593
* And If You Feel

421
00:20:56,593 --> 00:20:58,747
* Like I Feel, Baby

422
00:20:58,747 --> 00:21:00,731
* Then Come On

423
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,025
* Oh, Come On

424
00:21:03,025 --> 00:21:04,379
* Whoo

425
00:21:04,379 --> 00:21:05,972
* Let's Get It On

426
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:09,364
* Oh, Baby

427
00:21:09,364 --> 00:21:12,242
* Let's Get It On

428
00:21:12,242 --> 00:21:14,336
Are You Okay?
You Seem Distracted.

429
00:21:20,518 --> 00:21:24,162
Uh, It's Just
Because I-I-I Just Remembered

430
00:21:24,162 --> 00:21:26,008
That I Have A Dinner.

431
00:21:26,008 --> 00:21:27,940
I'll-I'll Call Marc
And Have Him,

432
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,703
Uh, Uh, Reschedule.

433
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:36,824
300 People?

434
00:21:36,824 --> 00:21:39,964
I- I Thought I Was Making Food
For 50, M-Maybe 60 At The Most.

435
00:21:39,964 --> 00:21:41,470
Well, You Can Thank Amanda.

436
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,862
I Had No Idea It Was
Gonna Get This Big,

437
00:21:43,862 --> 00:21:46,814
<I>But, Papi, What Am I Gonna Do?
I Promised Jesse.</I>

438
00:21:46,854 --> 00:21:50,651
<I>Sweetheart, Why Are You Going To So Much
Trouble For A Boy? Because She Likes Him, Papi.</I>

439
00:21:50,651 --> 00:21:53,929
I Do. I Do Like Him, And I
Shouldn't Even Be Saying That.

440
00:21:53,962 --> 00:21:56,449
A Guy Is The Last Thing
I Should Be Thinking About.

441
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:59,709
Why? You're Young, You Have
A Good Job, Your Own Apartment.

442
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:02,569
Yeah, And You're Wearing
Heels Sometimes.

443
00:22:02,747 --> 00:22:04,064
Thank God.

444
00:22:04,064 --> 00:22:05,588
<I>He's Nice To You, Mija?</I>

445
00:22:05,588 --> 00:22:08,577
So Nice, But I Can't.
I Can't Do This.

446
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,546
I Have To Cancel.
I Can't Afford This Party.

447
00:22:10,546 --> 00:22:13,031
You Guys Are Thinking
About This All Wrong.

448
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,984
Okay? It Doesn't Have
To Cost That Much.

449
00:22:14,984 --> 00:22:16,723
You Know, I Was Reading
In "Vanity Fair" One Time

450
00:22:16,723 --> 00:22:19,165
That Going Budget Is
Totally In Now,

451
00:22:19,165 --> 00:22:22,520
Like, Cheap Is The New Chic.
Well, Cheap We Can Work With.

452
00:22:22,703 --> 00:22:24,709
Maybe I Can Get A Discount
At Flushing Burgers,

453
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:27,195
Cut Up A Bunch Of Jumbos,
Do A Mole For Dipping.

454
00:22:27,195 --> 00:22:29,208
Oh, And We Can Make A Ton
Of Sangria.

455
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:31,881
Cheap Wine, Old Fruit, A Box
Of Sugar-People Get Drunk.

456
00:22:31,881 --> 00:22:34,565
They Don't Care.
Drinking Is Bad.

457
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:38,586
Okay, So We Have A Theme
- South Of The Border. Oh, And Then We Can Use

458
00:22:38,586 --> 00:22:41,124
<I>The Decorations From My
QuinceaERa. Oh, Good Idea.</I>

459
00:22:41,124 --> 00:22:43,533
That's Such A Great Idea. Tacky
Mexican Stuff Is So Kitschy.

460
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:47,019
What? I'm Allowed To Say That.
It's My Heritage.

461
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:49,241
Oh, And, Guys, Thank You.

462
00:22:49,241 --> 00:22:50,865
You Always Come Through
For Me.

463
00:22:51,087 --> 00:22:52,817
You're Like A Total Snow Day.

464
00:22:53,758 --> 00:22:55,324
That's A Good Thing.

465
00:22:55,357 --> 00:22:57,342
Oh.
Oh. Okay.

466
00:22:59,923 --> 00:23:02,224
So How Did It Go
With Connor?

467
00:23:02,224 --> 00:23:04,457
Did You Break Him?
Did He Cry?

468
00:23:04,491 --> 00:23:07,057
Do I Need To Offer Him
A Comforting Hug?

469
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,498
Check My Calendar, Please.

470
00:23:08,498 --> 00:23:10,180
What, That's It? You're Not
Gonna Tell Me Anything

471
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,453
After All The Work I Did
To Dig Up That Dirt?

472
00:23:12,503 --> 00:23:16,337
I Didn't Use It. It Wasn't The
Time. So When Will Be The Time?

473
00:23:16,337 --> 00:23:18,215
Since When Are You
Such A Nosey Parker?

474
00:23:18,215 --> 00:23:21,291
Your Job Is To Do What I Say
And Not Ask Any Questions.

475
00:23:22,391 --> 00:23:23,703
I Hope I'm Not Interrupting.

476
00:23:23,852 --> 00:23:25,398
Oh, No.

477
00:23:25,587 --> 00:23:28,568
Connor, My, Uh,
My Door Is Always Open.

478
00:23:28,568 --> 00:23:31,105
I Just Wanted To Let You Know
I'd Be Out Most Of The Day.

479
00:23:31,105 --> 00:23:33,376
Hey, How Was
That Dinner Last Night?

480
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,342
It Was Fun...
Just Delightful.

481
00:23:35,376 --> 00:23:37,110
Thank You For Asking.

482
00:23:37,143 --> 00:23:39,448
I'll See You
At The Fashion Heats Up Party.

483
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:43,586
Fun? Delightful?

484
00:23:43,586 --> 00:23:45,235
You Didn't Have A Dinner
Last Night.

485
00:23:45,235 --> 00:23:47,059
You Don't Even Eat Dinner.

486
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:48,962
Oh, My God, You Like Him.

487
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:51,507
Don't Be Ridiculous.

488
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,774
Willie, You Saluted Him.

489
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,996
You Haven't Saluted Anyone
Since Cheney.

490
00:23:56,265 --> 00:23:58,415
You Have Fallen For Him
Like Everyone Else Here.

491
00:23:58,415 --> 00:24:00,455
I Don't Fall For Anyone, Marc.

492
00:24:00,602 --> 00:24:02,372
I'm Not Like
Those Other Women Out There,

493
00:24:02,372 --> 00:24:06,948
Ruled By Their Emotions. Willie,
It's Okay To Feel Something.

494
00:24:06,948 --> 00:24:10,150
No, It's Not, Not When It
Gets In The Way Of Ambition.

495
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,667
How Do You Think
I Got This Far?

496
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:14,279
Now I've Had
My Momentary Lapse Of Judgment,

497
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:16,483
But That Is Over Now.

498
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,151
So What Are You Gonna Do Now?

499
00:24:19,184 --> 00:24:20,650
Finish What I Started.

500
00:24:21,064 --> 00:24:23,483
That Party Is Gonna Get
A Lot More Interesting.

501
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:29,751
Marc.

502
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:34,624
Oh. I Didn't Even
See You There.

503
00:24:34,658 --> 00:24:36,125
What's Going On, Marc?

504
00:24:36,158 --> 00:24:37,994
I Mean, I-I Asked You
A Really Important Question

505
00:24:37,994 --> 00:24:39,994
And Then You-You Don't Call Me
Back For Three Days?

506
00:24:39,994 --> 00:24:43,867
I'm So Sorry. It Has
Just Been Nonstop Around Here.

507
00:24:44,271 --> 00:24:46,075
What, With The Blackmailing,
Backstabbing

508
00:24:46,075 --> 00:24:48,041
And Going On Pinkberry Runs,
I've Barely Even Had Time

509
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:50,070
To Take The Curlers
Out Of My Hair.

510
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,030
Is There Still One
Back There?

511
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:59,070
Why Is The Idea
Of Moving In With Me So Hard?

512
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,262
It-It's-It's Just Big.

513
00:25:02,444 --> 00:25:04,123
It's Like Deciding
To Get A Kid.

514
00:25:04,123 --> 00:25:06,308
How Do You Know It's The Right
Time Or What Kind To Get?

515
00:25:06,308 --> 00:25:07,984
I Mean,
Do You Go Russian, Chinese

516
00:25:07,984 --> 00:25:09,648
Or Stay Local And Do Something
South American?

517
00:25:09,648 --> 00:25:11,636
And Then What If You're Wrong,
And It Clashes

518
00:25:11,636 --> 00:25:15,771
With Your Furniture
- Forget It, Marc. You Gave Me Your Answer.

519
00:25:23,497 --> 00:25:26,463
So I Have A Car Picking You Up
At Your Party At 10:30

520
00:25:26,497 --> 00:25:28,451
So You Can Be At My Party
By 11:00.

521
00:25:28,451 --> 00:25:30,538
Do You Think It's Weird
That I've Left Two Messages

522
00:25:30,538 --> 00:25:33,107
For Connor, And He Hasn't
Called Me Back? No, He's Probably

523
00:25:33,107 --> 00:25:35,107
Just In A Place Where He
Can't Answer. I'm His Boss.

524
00:25:35,107 --> 00:25:39,233
He Should Be Letting Me Know Where He's
Gonna Be All Day. Is Everything Okay?

525
00:25:40,752 --> 00:25:43,915
Yeah, Everything's Fine.
It's Just Something My Mom Said.

526
00:25:44,134 --> 00:25:45,210
You Know What?

527
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,779
You Should Go Home
And Get Ready For Your Party.

528
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:48,170
I Will, And, Oh, Daniel,

529
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:50,210
Thank You So Much
For That Donation.

530
00:25:50,768 --> 00:25:52,914
Well, It Is
The "Mode" After Party.

531
00:25:53,293 --> 00:25:56,933
Besides, I Heard The Singer
Of The Band Is Just To Die For.

532
00:25:56,966 --> 00:25:58,475
Why Do I
Tell You Anything?

533
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:04,300
<I>* Hey, You</I>

534
00:26:09,013 --> 00:26:12,000
I'm Sorry.
You're Not On This List.

535
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,937
S
A Crisp George Washington

536
00:26:13,937 --> 00:26:15,247
Could Persuade Me.

537
00:26:15,665 --> 00:26:18,099
That Means A $20!

538
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,445
Okay, Here You Go.

539
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,380
Not So Fast, Gorgeous.

540
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,178
Mama Owes The Government.

541
00:26:35,023 --> 00:26:38,175
See, The-The-The Trick
To A Good Mole Is Cinnamon.

542
00:26:39,023 --> 00:26:40,575
Hey, Man,
Can I Wear Your Hat?

543
00:26:40,575 --> 00:26:42,004
Don't Touch The Hat.

544
00:26:42,004 --> 00:26:44,477
Aah!
Oh, My God. What A Turnout.

545
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:46,122
It's Like Everybody's
Showing Up.

546
00:26:46,122 --> 00:26:47,980
I Think One Of The Understudies
From "Spamalot"

547
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,627
Just Used My Bathroom.
No.

548
00:26:49,627 --> 00:26:51,688
Oh, And Have You Seen Jesse?

549
00:26:51,688 --> 00:26:54,655
'Cause I Think The Band Wants To Start.
Oh, Yeah, I Think I Saw Him Downstairs.

550
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,307
Betty, He's So Cute!

551
00:26:57,307 --> 00:26:59,929
All Sad And Tortured-
I See Why You Like Him.

552
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:01,914
Right?
I Know.

553
00:27:04,995 --> 00:27:06,962
Oh, Finally.
Connor Left Me A Message.

554
00:27:06,995 --> 00:27:09,562
Why Wasn't He
At That Dreadful Party?

555
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:11,004
If I Had To Sit And Listen

556
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:13,662
To Scarlett Johansson Babble
About Climate Change,

557
00:27:13,695 --> 00:27:16,706
He Should Have.
He Said His Meeting Went Late.

558
00:27:16,762 --> 00:27:18,943
He's Gonna See Me
At The After Party.

559
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,428
<I>Drama At Casa Del Meade.</I>

560
00:27:21,428 --> 00:27:23,129
<I>Word On The Boulevard</I>

561
00:27:23,162 --> 00:27:25,508
<I>Is That Meade Publications
Is Selling Off Some Magazines.</I>

562
00:27:25,508 --> 00:27:27,995
<I>My Anonymous Source Reginald
Has Confirmed</I>

563
00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:30,375
<I>That Meade's New C.F.O.,
Connor Owens,</I>

564
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:33,172
<I>Met With Cond?Nast For Several
Hours This Afternoon.</I>

565
00:27:33,628 --> 00:27:35,315
He's Working With Wilhelmina?

566
00:27:35,315 --> 00:27:36,562
I'm Sorry, Daniel.

567
00:27:36,562 --> 00:27:38,174
Oh, He's Gonna Be, Too.

568
00:27:41,012 --> 00:27:43,397
Hi. Welcome. Welcome.
Have Fun.

569
00:27:44,879 --> 00:27:45,868
Jesse.

570
00:27:46,452 --> 00:27:49,389
What Are You Doing Out Here?
The Band's Ready To Start.

571
00:27:49,852 --> 00:27:51,318
Are You Okay?

572
00:27:51,352 --> 00:27:54,318
It's-Th-That's Too Big.
I- I Can't Do That.

573
00:27:54,352 --> 00:27:57,886
Of Course You Can.
No, I-What If I Suck?

574
00:27:57,918 --> 00:28:00,404
There's No Way You Could Suck.
You're Just-

575
00:28:00,404 --> 00:28:02,318
You're Just Having A Little Bit
Of Stage Fright.

576
00:28:02,352 --> 00:28:05,652
I- I'm A Fake, Betty. I-I Just
Don't Think I Have It.

577
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:08,218
Yes, You Do.

578
00:28:08,252 --> 00:28:10,719
Look, Maybe You Can't
Feel It Right Now,

579
00:28:10,752 --> 00:28:12,752
But It's In There.
I Can See It.

580
00:28:13,177 --> 00:28:16,004
And-And These Bad Thoughts,
That's What's Fake.

581
00:28:16,385 --> 00:28:18,985
As Soon As You Get Up There
And Start Playing,

582
00:28:19,018 --> 00:28:21,533
Everyone Else Is
Gonna See What I Do.

583
00:28:25,886 --> 00:28:27,352
All Right.

584
00:28:27,385 --> 00:28:28,692
Okay.

585
00:28:29,685 --> 00:28:31,185
Whoo!
Okay.

586
00:28:31,957 --> 00:28:34,308
God, Betty,
You're So Beautiful.

587
00:28:34,886 --> 00:28:36,285
Thank You.

588
00:28:45,407 --> 00:28:46,838
* But I'll Try My Best

589
00:28:46,838 --> 00:28:49,802
* Either You Live Your Life
Or You Sit Witness *

590
00:28:49,802 --> 00:28:52,863
* While A Look-Alike
Comes And Steals Your Bliss *

591
00:28:52,863 --> 00:28:54,628
* So Come On

592
00:28:54,629 --> 00:28:58,496
* Get On With It

593
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:01,097
* We're Just Wasting Time

594
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,796
Isn't He Amazing?

595
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:05,254
Yeah, But Ivanka Trump
Just Put A Burger In Her Purse,

596
00:29:05,254 --> 00:29:07,545
So I Have To Go Call Randy.
Okay, Love You. Bye. Okay.

597
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,330
*... With It

598
00:29:11,364 --> 00:29:13,430
* We're Just Wasting Time

599
00:29:13,464 --> 00:29:15,097
* Get On With It

600
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:18,364
Hey, So I Think I Figured Out
Who Betty's Crush Is.

601
00:29:18,397 --> 00:29:19,799
It's That Old Guy Over There.

602
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,209
That's Her Father.
Oh.

603
00:29:23,496 --> 00:29:25,464
Mandy,
Cliff Won't Call Me Back.

604
00:29:25,496 --> 00:29:28,528
He's Mad Because He Thinks I Don't
Want To Move In With Him. But You Don't.

605
00:29:28,528 --> 00:29:31,514
Well, Why Should I?
Everything Was Fine Before.

606
00:29:32,776 --> 00:29:35,312
We Had Our Lives
And Our Hair Products Separate.

607
00:29:35,312 --> 00:29:38,424
Everyone Looked Good
And Nothing Changed.

608
00:29:39,629 --> 00:29:41,046
Why Does He Want
To Ruin That?

609
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:44,097
Oh, Marc,
Are You Really Mad At Cliff,

610
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,463
Or Are You Starting To Have
Doubts About Him?

611
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,329
Oh, My God!
They Put Out Cake.

612
00:29:49,863 --> 00:29:51,364
Do What You Want.

613
00:29:51,397 --> 00:29:53,963
I'm Sure You'll Make
The Right Decision. Bye.

614
00:29:53,997 --> 00:29:55,963
*... Always Come To A Head

615
00:29:55,997 --> 00:29:58,496
* Over A Glass Of Wine
And A Cigarette *

616
00:29:58,529 --> 00:30:01,496
* You Got A Little Dagger
Stuck Inside My Chest *

617
00:30:01,529 --> 00:30:05,084
* I'm 'Bout As Ready Now
As I'll Ever Get *

618
00:30:09,991 --> 00:30:11,438
Thanks.

619
00:30:12,055 --> 00:30:15,954
So, Uh, I Wanted To Try
A Little Solo Something, Uh,

620
00:30:15,988 --> 00:30:18,954
And, Uh, Dedicate This
To Someone Here Who's...

621
00:30:18,988 --> 00:30:21,870
We-Well, She's Just
Really Special.

622
00:30:28,455 --> 00:30:33,420
* Every Day
Just Blurs Into One *

623
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:38,987
* The Moon Starts To Look
Just Like The Sun *

624
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:43,354
* Full Steam Ahead,
Day To Night *

625
00:30:43,387 --> 00:30:46,420
* Never Fully Charged

626
00:30:46,454 --> 00:30:48,154
* Never Quite Right

627
00:30:48,187 --> 00:30:52,220
* But She Was A Snowy Day

628
00:30:52,254 --> 00:30:54,621
* A Break From Working Hard

629
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:59,617
* For Such Little Pay

630
00:30:59,617 --> 00:31:02,651
* She Was A Snowy Day

631
00:31:02,684 --> 00:31:04,818
* She Let Me Get Some Rest

632
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:11,384
* She Let Me Sleep Real Late

633
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:16,983
* So I Could Fight Another Day

634
00:31:17,017 --> 00:31:20,883
* She Was A Snowy Day

635
00:31:21,273 --> 00:31:22,906
Is Everyone
Enjoying Themselves?

636
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:28,236
Who Cares? He Dedicated
A Song To You! He Likes You!

637
00:31:28,236 --> 00:31:30,455
I Don't Know.
But I Mean, I Think He Does.

638
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:32,753
Earlier, He Told Me
I Was Beautiful.

639
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:34,826
What More
Do You Need, Girl?!

640
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,426
Go Ask Him Out!

641
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,692
I- I Know.
I- I Should, Shouldn't I?

642
00:31:38,725 --> 00:31:39,859
Yes!

643
00:31:39,892 --> 00:31:41,359
Okay, I Will. I Will.

644
00:31:41,393 --> 00:31:43,557
Uh, I Should Probably
Do That Now?

645
00:31:43,557 --> 00:31:45,359
Yes, Yes. Ready?
Okay.

646
00:31:45,393 --> 00:31:47,592
Here I Go.

647
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:48,892
Go! Go!

648
00:31:48,926 --> 00:31:51,026
<I>* Show Me What You Got</I>

649
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:54,026
Hi, Ms. Slater. How Are You?
Good To See You.

650
00:31:55,651 --> 00:31:57,180
You A Friend Of Betty's?

651
00:31:57,551 --> 00:31:59,514
What? Oh, God, No.

652
00:31:59,514 --> 00:32:00,981
She's A Nice Girl.

653
00:32:01,015 --> 00:32:02,915
I Live Right Below Her-
4g.

654
00:32:02,948 --> 00:32:06,348
Am I To Understand
I'm On Betty's Roof?

655
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:07,681
Yeah.

656
00:32:11,648 --> 00:32:13,915
<I>* If You Get That Feeling</I>

657
00:32:13,948 --> 00:32:15,915
<I>* But You Can't Describe It</I>

658
00:32:15,948 --> 00:32:18,181
<I>* It's Okay</I>

659
00:32:18,215 --> 00:32:19,681
<I>* I Know You Like It</I>

660
00:32:19,714 --> 00:32:21,447
<I>* When You Get That Feeling</I>

661
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:24,081
<I>* But You Can't Describe It</I>

662
00:32:24,115 --> 00:32:26,547
<I>* All You Know
Is That You Like It *</I>

663
00:32:26,581 --> 00:32:29,874
You Look Beautiful. I Think We're
Done With The Charm, Aren't We?

664
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:32,728
Listen, I Know You're In Bed
With Daniel, So Let Me Be Blunt.

665
00:32:32,977 --> 00:32:34,773
You Start Playing
For My Side,

666
00:32:34,773 --> 00:32:36,766
Or I Will Reveal
Some Things About You

667
00:32:36,766 --> 00:32:40,343
You Probably Don't Want Out There.
Wilhelmina, Can We Go Somewhere And Talk?

668
00:32:40,726 --> 00:32:43,307
Connor, I Know All About
Your Meetings At Cond?Nast.

669
00:32:43,307 --> 00:32:45,029
What The Hell Happened
To Our Deal?

670
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:47,364
I'm Not Gonna Have You Two
Conspiring Behind My Back.

671
00:32:47,449 --> 00:32:49,276
I Don't Care
What Your Contract Says.

672
00:32:49,276 --> 00:32:52,243
I Want You Out Of Here. Daniel, Do
You Know How Much It's Gonna Cost

673
00:32:52,276 --> 00:32:55,409
To Fire A Man Like This? Oh, He
Won't Need To. I'll Walk Right Now.

674
00:32:55,443 --> 00:32:57,112
God, You Two Are Children.

675
00:32:58,029 --> 00:33:00,228
I Played Your Game
To Get The Job,

676
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,691
<I>But That Is Where It Ends.
I Took The Meeting</I>

677
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:05,257
Because You Asked Me
To Exercise My Judgment,

678
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:08,189
Which Is This-That Selling Off
A Couple Of Magazines

679
00:33:08,189 --> 00:33:09,725
Makes Financial Sense,

680
00:33:09,758 --> 00:33:11,725
Far More Sense Than Preserving
Your Father's Legacy

681
00:33:11,758 --> 00:33:13,057
At Any Cost.

682
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:15,360
And You-Whatever It Is
You Think You've Got On Me,

683
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,462
Let It Out.

684
00:33:16,508 --> 00:33:17,693
I'll Tell You What.
I'll Even Help You.

685
00:33:17,693 --> 00:33:21,330
Drugs? I've Done
Pretty Much Everything.

686
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,990
I've Slept With
My Best Friend's Wife.

687
00:33:23,187 --> 00:33:25,960
Oh, Here's A Great One.
My First Job At Smith Barney?

688
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,786
I Overhear Two Guys In
An Elevator Trading Stock Tips.

689
00:33:28,786 --> 00:33:31,125
I End Up Losing My Shirt
And I Almost Go To Jail.

690
00:33:31,141 --> 00:33:32,839
But I Turn My Life Around.

691
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:35,105
I Make Myself Into Somebody
That I Can Be Proud Of.

692
00:33:35,105 --> 00:33:38,268
So If You Want Me To Do The Job
That You Hired Me For, Fine.

693
00:33:38,825 --> 00:33:41,673
But If You Want Me
To Pick Sides, Forget It.

694
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:44,539
I'm Nobody's Bitch.

695
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,640
I Need A Drink.

696
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:55,691
Jesse?

697
00:33:55,725 --> 00:33:57,191
Are You In There?

698
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:03,302
Oh! Sorry.

699
00:34:03,924 --> 00:34:05,779
Jeez, Betty,
Ever Hear Of Knocking?

700
00:34:13,753 --> 00:34:15,500
Betty, W-Wait. Betty, Wait!

701
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,444
Betty, It Was Bound To Happen
Sooner Or Later.

702
00:34:17,444 --> 00:34:19,238
Next Time, I'll Just
Leave A Bra On The Doorknob.

703
00:34:19,711 --> 00:34:21,756
<I>You Are
The Worst Roommate Ever.</I>

704
00:34:22,078 --> 00:34:25,441
You Are Selfish And Insensitive,
And I Want You Out.

705
00:34:25,441 --> 00:34:27,620
Just Be Gone
By Tomorrow Morning.

706
00:34:30,859 --> 00:34:33,593
<I>* And Dance To Me</I>

707
00:34:33,627 --> 00:34:36,627
<I>* Again</I>

708
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:40,859
<I>* Like You Were Stone</I>

709
00:34:40,893 --> 00:34:44,312
Connor, I Wanna Apologize
For My Behavior.

710
00:34:45,297 --> 00:34:47,792
I Always Blackmail People
When I'm Nervous.

711
00:34:47,792 --> 00:34:50,123
It's Just
Kind Of My Go-To.

712
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,060
<I>* Then Dance To Me</I>

713
00:34:57,093 --> 00:34:59,285
There Aren't A Lot
Of Nice People

714
00:34:59,285 --> 00:35:00,589
In This Business.

715
00:35:00,589 --> 00:35:02,369
I... Didn't Expect

716
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:05,124
To Meet Someone
Who Actually Has Integrity.

717
00:35:06,393 --> 00:35:08,051
Thank You.

718
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:11,314
We Need You.

719
00:35:11,314 --> 00:35:13,856
So If You Decide To Stay,

720
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,030
Let's Start
With A Clean Slate.

721
00:35:18,293 --> 00:35:19,704
I'd Like That,

722
00:35:19,975 --> 00:35:21,042
As Long As I Don't

723
00:35:21,042 --> 00:35:23,252
Have To "Knuckle Bump"
With Daniel Anymore.

724
00:35:27,298 --> 00:35:29,240
We Still
Have To Try That Scotch.

725
00:35:30,354 --> 00:35:31,610
It's A Date.

726
00:35:39,075 --> 00:35:42,127
Will You Excuse Me?
It's My FiancE.

727
00:35:56,046 --> 00:35:57,223
So Can I Call You?

728
00:35:57,223 --> 00:35:59,032
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm In The Book.

729
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:00,478
Hunter Farthington.

730
00:36:08,242 --> 00:36:09,609
Marc?

731
00:36:09,643 --> 00:36:12,038
Cliff! What Are You Doing Here? I
- I Got Your 20 Messages.

732
00:36:13,995 --> 00:36:17,309
Sweetie, I'm-I'm Sorry.
I- I-I Should've Known That-

733
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,837
That Asking You To Move In
Would-Would Cause A Meltdown.

734
00:36:19,837 --> 00:36:21,920
Hey, You...
You're A Neurotic Mess,

735
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,794
<I>And I Love That About You.</I>

736
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:35,685
Look, All That Matters
Is That We Love Each Other.

737
00:36:42,622 --> 00:36:43,960
Marry Me.

738
00:36:45,376 --> 00:36:46,241
What?

739
00:36:46,752 --> 00:36:48,362
Marry Me, Cliff.

740
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:50,573
I Wanna Be With You
Forever.

741
00:37:07,109 --> 00:37:09,316
Oh, I Blew It
Up There With Connor.

742
00:37:10,042 --> 00:37:12,138
I Can't Believe What A Fool
I Made Out Of Myself.

743
00:37:12,721 --> 00:37:15,334
Well, I'm Pretty Sure
I'm A Bigger Fool.

744
00:37:16,228 --> 00:37:18,090
I Threw Him A Party.

745
00:37:19,928 --> 00:37:21,347
Are You Crying?

746
00:37:23,695 --> 00:37:26,740
I Was So Stupid To Think
That He Would Like Me.

747
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,894
Of Course
He Likes Amanda.

748
00:37:28,995 --> 00:37:30,599
Amanda?

749
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:32,646
They Were Kissing.
I Walked In On Them.

750
00:37:34,214 --> 00:37:36,198
I Should've Known That
When He Said I Was Beautiful,

751
00:37:36,198 --> 00:37:38,078
<I>He Meant On The Inside.</I>

752
00:37:38,961 --> 00:37:40,228
<I>You Are.</I>

753
00:37:40,261 --> 00:37:42,069
You Don't Have To Say That,
Daniel.

754
00:37:43,617 --> 00:37:45,364
I'm Fine With Who I Am,

755
00:37:46,067 --> 00:37:47,934
But I'm Not Beautiful.

756
00:37:47,967 --> 00:37:51,000
Betty... Men Are Stupid.

757
00:37:51,034 --> 00:37:52,695
They Go For The Obvious.

758
00:37:52,905 --> 00:37:54,767
Trust Me. I Know.

759
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,257
I'm Still Doing It,
And I Should Know Better.

760
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,833
But You're 24.

761
00:38:00,867 --> 00:38:02,917
It's Okay To Have A Crush,

762
00:38:03,466 --> 00:38:05,130
Act A Little Stupid.

763
00:38:06,225 --> 00:38:08,903
But You Have To Believe Me
When I Say This-

764
00:38:09,334 --> 00:38:11,798
<I>You Are Beautiful.</I>

765
00:38:35,167 --> 00:38:36,500
Hey.

766
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,324
So...

767
00:38:41,594 --> 00:38:44,534
I Made, Like,
A Ton Of Money Tonight.

768
00:38:44,727 --> 00:38:46,968
And... I'm A Simple Girl.

769
00:38:46,968 --> 00:38:48,517
What Do I Need It For?

770
00:38:48,889 --> 00:38:52,043
Here. You Should
Put It Toward Rent.

771
00:39:02,189 --> 00:39:05,114
Hey, So Remember That Guy
That I Was Kissing Earlier?

772
00:39:05,114 --> 00:39:06,664
Yeah, I Don't Think
You Know Him.

773
00:39:06,664 --> 00:39:09,127
<I>Anyway, I Am So Over Him.</I>

774
00:39:09,127 --> 00:39:12,387
I Was Talking To Him, And It
Turns Out He's Kind Of Stupid.

775
00:39:12,388 --> 00:39:14,386
I Mean, Yes,
He Is The Kind Of Guy

776
00:39:14,386 --> 00:39:16,362
A Girl Would Totally
Fall For, But...

777
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,388
He Is So Not Worth It.

778
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:25,908
Betty, I Had No Idea.

779
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:28,976
Amanda, Look.

780
00:39:29,526 --> 00:39:31,126
I Was Wrong.

781
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:33,093
You Aren't
The Worst Roommate Ever.

782
00:39:33,693 --> 00:39:35,691
And If You Need
To Stay Here

783
00:39:35,691 --> 00:39:38,311
For...
A Little While Longer,

784
00:39:40,493 --> 00:39:42,190
I'm Fine With That.

785
00:39:46,892 --> 00:39:48,715
You Know, Betty,
You're Lucky.

786
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,565
When Someone
Falls In Love With You,

787
00:39:52,565 --> 00:39:54,096
It's Real.

788
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:56,046
I've Never Had That.

789
00:39:57,577 --> 00:40:00,215
I Never Know
If I'm Loved For Who I Am

790
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:02,825
Or Because I'm So Pretty.

791
00:40:08,892 --> 00:40:11,026
Why Don't You Finish
Cleaning Up In Here?

792
00:40:35,658 --> 00:40:36,774
Betty.

793
00:40:40,925 --> 00:40:42,592
Have A Seat.

794
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:47,892
* Details Of Your Look

795
00:40:47,925 --> 00:40:50,359
* Like Your Tights

796
00:40:50,393 --> 00:40:53,126
* Killing Me By Shoot

797
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,592
* Just In Once

798
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:58,592
* Oh, See, Just Take A Look

799
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:00,658
* With Your Cries

800
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:03,925
* Since The Days Of School

801
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:06,092
* You And I

802
00:41:06,126 --> 00:41:09,625
* You're On My Mind

803
00:41:11,825 --> 00:41:15,196
* Just Let Me Play
