 <i>papi,</i> medical bills?

19
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:30,735
didn't i tell you that we're
supposed to worry about these?

20
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:34,526
i just want to help out.you can help out
by just getting better, okay?

21
00:02:34,566 --> 00:02:35,566
yeah.

22
00:02:36,332 --> 00:02:37,866
what happened?
i thought you said

23
00:02:37,896 --> 00:02:39,400
you were gonna send these
over to insurance.

24
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,048
no. that's what i was telling
you the other day. remember
but, hilda

25
00:02:41,048 --> 00:02:44,426
 <i>idisculpe!</i>
everything okay?

26
00:02:44,905 --> 00:02:46,904
(chuckles) yeah.

27
00:02:46,904 --> 00:02:49,466
yeah. oh! did you just hear
a uebird?

28
00:02:49,496 --> 00:02:52,322
oh, yeah, the one that i saw
out back the other day?
uh-huh.

29
00:02:52,322 --> 00:02:54,411
it's winter.
i know.
it's weird, right?

30
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:58,515
i thought you were gonna
send these in to insurance.

31
00:02:58,515 --> 00:03:00,450
they said that
they could process it faster

32
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,153
if we faxed it in, so i figured
you could just do it from work.
oh, okay, fine.

33
00:03:04,153 --> 00:03:06,812
oh, and before i forget,
i made up a checklist of things

34
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,508
for you not to forget
to do today.

35
00:03:08,508 --> 00:03:11,797
you know, to help you out.
oh, that is terrific.

36
00:03:11,797 --> 00:03:14,064
is that in addition
to all the post-it notes

37
00:03:14,064 --> 00:03:17,715
that you have left
everywhere?
well, you get busy, you know?
it's easy to forget.

38
00:03:17,715 --> 00:03:19,802
which reminds me, you should
probably take <i>papi</i> in

39
00:03:19,802 --> 00:03:22,194
to see dr. steve,
get that cough checked out.

40
00:03:22,224 --> 00:03:25,492
"take <i>papi</i> to doctor--"
to dr. steve. yeah.

41
00:03:25,492 --> 00:03:28,591
betty, i get it. stop worrying.
i can handle it.

42
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:29,997
get out of here. just go.
go to work.

43
00:03:29,997 --> 00:03:34,563
oh, but promise me
you're not gonna wear this.

44
00:03:34,723 --> 00:03:36,534
(scoffs) no, i just ran out
of clothes.

45
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:37,753
i have to go back
to my apartment,

46
00:03:37,764 --> 00:03:39,593
which i haven't seen
in, like, forever.

47
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:41,223
i'm excited to see it.

48
00:03:50,372 --> 00:03:51,617
(gasps) betty!

49
00:03:51,617 --> 00:03:54,245
oh, my god,
you look fantastic!

50
00:03:54,245 --> 00:03:56,104
aah!
how many times
did i tell you

51
00:03:56,134 --> 00:03:58,434
to stop eating
that fatty mexican food?

52
00:03:58,464 --> 00:04:00,412
you are too young
to have a heart attack.

53
00:04:00,412 --> 00:04:03,647
amanda, i didn't have
a heart attack. my dad did.

54
00:04:03,964 --> 00:04:06,464
ow!
how could you let me
worry about you like that?

55
00:04:06,504 --> 00:04:09,464
what?
i'm sorry, betty. i was just
really concerned about you.

56
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,741
wait. your dad--is he...

57
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:14,264
he's... (sighs) better.
thank you.

58
00:04:14,304 --> 00:04:16,107
it's been
a rough couple of weeks.
(door closes)

59
00:04:16,107 --> 00:04:17,280
oh, i totally get it.

60
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,890
i had to work extra shifts
at d.t. mcdoubleshots

61
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,836
to make up for
the vacation time off at "mode."

62
00:04:21,836 --> 00:04:24,007
and i will never, ever get
the smell of fried jalapeO

63
00:04:24,007 --> 00:04:26,937
out of my hair.
is that why
you haven't had a chance

64
00:04:26,937 --> 00:04:31,724
to clean up around here?
clean? (laughs)
i missed you.

65
00:04:31,724 --> 00:04:33,156
are these all bills?

66
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:36,471
oh, i can't believe
how much i'm spending

67
00:04:36,471 --> 00:04:38,249
for a place i never see.

68
00:04:38,249 --> 00:04:39,903
well, i have seen it,

69
00:04:39,903 --> 00:04:41,981
and, unfortunately,
we have roaches.

70
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,407
i know.
at first, i was scared,

71
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:46,727
and then i tried naming them.
oh, look!
aah!

72
00:04:47,002 --> 00:04:49,790
that's little betty.
she's just like you--

73
00:04:49,944 --> 00:04:52,636
a survivor.

74
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,298

75
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:02,049

79
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,366

80
00:05:16,796 --> 00:05:19,910

81
00:05:20,142 --> 00:05:23,200

82
00:05:24,182 --> 00:05:25,415

83
00:05:25,415 --> 00:05:25,965

84
00:05:25,965 --> 00:05:28,173

00:05:28,173 --> 00:05:29,811

00:05:36,283 --> 00:05:39,018
oh. uh... sorry.
(beeping)

88
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:42,670
guess we're gonna have to
tell him about us eventually.

89
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,696
i know, but...

90
00:05:44,696 --> 00:05:47,264
he's all alone right now.
telling him just seems cruel.

91
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,835
not to mention how awkward
it'll make work for both of you.

92
00:05:49,835 --> 00:05:52,077
back in college, he was
definitely the jealous type.

93
00:05:52,077 --> 00:05:53,992
maybe he just needs time?

94
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,391
yeah.

95
00:06:03,846 --> 00:06:06,398
(electronic female voice)
 <i>you have 214 new messages.</i>

96
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:07,726
 <i>message one.</i>
(sighs)

97
00:06:07,771 --> 00:06:09,501
(daniel) betty, hey.

98
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:10,538
okay.
hi. how are you doing?

99
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:12,224
daniel!
how's your father?

100
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,301
(chuckles) what happened
to your desk?

101
00:06:15,301 --> 00:06:19,102
yeah. uh, this is what happens
when i'm gone for two weeks.

102
00:06:19,102 --> 00:06:21,056
my dad is doing better,
thank you.

103
00:06:21,056 --> 00:06:25,092
and thank you
for all those flowers you sent.
is 12 dozen too much?

104
00:06:25,092 --> 00:06:28,426
that's why <i>you</i> should always do
the flower ordering around here.
yep.

105
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:30,724
not that you can't take
as much time off as you need,

106
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,802
of course.
no, daniel,
i need to be working.

107
00:06:32,802 --> 00:06:35,319
besides, hilda and i are gonna
split the responsibilities

108
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:39,472
of taking care of my father,
so whatcha got for me?

109
00:06:39,686 --> 00:06:42,243
well, you can take my
vacation photos down to the lab.

110
00:06:42,243 --> 00:06:44,029
i was gonna print
some of the pictures up.
oh.

111
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,554
morning, daniel. oh!
oh! excuse me.

112
00:06:46,554 --> 00:06:48,659
yes, yes, you're excused.

113
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:51,075
no, wait, wait, you're not.

114
00:06:51,075 --> 00:06:52,298
here.

115
00:06:52,298 --> 00:06:55,008
cover photos of our
exclusive halston dres

116
00:06:55,008 --> 00:06:59,575
the press is already sniffing
around for them desperately.
i'll keep them
someplace safe.

117
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:02,074
what, are you dense?
i want you to leak them.

118
00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:03,520
i'd ask marc. he wants to,

119
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,911
but i hate to reward him
without any good reason.
it's okay, betty.
we'll catch up later.

120
00:07:09,042 --> 00:07:11,295
oh, i did miss work so--

121
00:07:11,295 --> 00:07:13,435
the look of fear
in people's faces.

122
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:15,435
i take it
from your goggle tan

123
00:07:15,475 --> 00:07:16,935
you did some skiing?

124
00:07:16,975 --> 00:07:20,005
and i take it from your tan
you also got some sun?
mm-hmm.

125
00:07:20,035 --> 00:07:22,803
or is it
that awful spray tan?

126
00:07:22,803 --> 00:07:25,024
you know, you look
a bit jaundiced.

127
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,493
hey.

128
00:07:26,493 --> 00:07:28,324
oh. hi, connor.
(daniel) oh...

129
00:07:28,805 --> 00:07:31,111
it looks like
you did some skiing, too.

130
00:07:31,111 --> 00:07:32,535
uh, snowboarding.

131
00:07:32,575 --> 00:07:34,035
i was in switzerland.

132
00:07:34,075 --> 00:07:35,075
aspen.

133
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:36,270
well, good.

134
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:39,552
i'll leave you to it then,
shall i? hmm.

135
00:07:40,605 --> 00:07:43,592
you know, it's kind of funny
you guys had the--

136
00:07:43,592 --> 00:07:44,937
yes. yes, yes. hilarious.

137
00:07:44,937 --> 00:07:47,727
as much as i love
your witty observations,

138
00:07:47,727 --> 00:07:49,328
i need to speak to connor,

139
00:07:49,328 --> 00:07:52,485
uh, about some upcoming
ad meetings.

140
00:07:52,485 --> 00:07:54,235
oh, connor.

141
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:56,675
(raises voice)
oh, connor.

142
00:07:56,705 --> 00:07:58,675
oh, connor.
mm.

143
00:08:05,105 --> 00:08:07,474
we have
to control ourselves.

144
00:08:07,474 --> 00:08:08,570
didn't we have an agreement

145
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,011
we'd keep this
out of the office?

146
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:12,722
we did.
i came in here to pee.

147
00:08:14,075 --> 00:08:16,126
(chuckles) so you did.

148
00:08:16,126 --> 00:08:18,640
look,
we had a wonderful time

149
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,449
in the swiss alps
for two weeks,

150
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:22,244
but now it's time
to get back to work,

151
00:08:22,244 --> 00:08:24,512
which means we have
to try harder to hide it,

152
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:27,175
starting with, uh...
this?

153
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:31,315
mm, it is a bit suspicious,
isn't it?
suspicious?

154
00:08:31,315 --> 00:08:33,451
even the "special" boy
in the mail room 

155
00:08:33,451 --> 00:08:35,310
could put the two of us
together.

156
00:08:35,976 --> 00:08:37,376
what's that?

157
00:08:37,823 --> 00:08:40,823
all you need to know is that
it's expensive, illegal

158
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:44,574
and will even out
your tan lines.

159
00:08:45,865 --> 00:08:48,293
you're not allergic to panda,
are you?

160
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,423
you saw nothing.

161
00:08:54,453 --> 00:08:56,753
uh, well, actually--
you saw nothing.

162
00:08:56,793 --> 00:08:58,335
oh! oh, oh, oh, oh.
yes, yes.
nothing!

163
00:08:58,335 --> 00:08:59,009
no, no, no, no.
(works zipper)

164
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:02,805
i saw nothing, but <i>they</i> are
abt to see <i>everything.</i>

165
00:09:04,093 --> 00:09:06,053
(sighs) thank you, marc.

166
00:09:06,093 --> 00:09:07,593
yeah.

167
00:09:11,477 --> 00:09:13,084
(justin) i don't think
mom's had a chance

168
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:14,891
to talk to dr. steve yet.

169
00:09:14,891 --> 00:09:18,407
really? well,
is everything okay?
no, no, it's good.

170
00:09:18,407 --> 00:09:20,090
this girl from my school
hired mom

171
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,648
to do her and her friends' hair
for her quinceaEra party.

172
00:09:22,786 --> 00:09:24,886
15 girls.
is that betty?
is that betty?

173
00:09:24,886 --> 00:09:28,273
yes. bye, betty.
oh, my god, oh, my god!
did you hear the good news?

174
00:09:28,273 --> 00:09:30,820
yeah!
yeah, that's, um, great.

175
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,393
i just--you know,
i'm--i'm worried

176
00:09:33,423 --> 00:09:35,691
that you might not have time
to do all of that,

177
00:09:35,691 --> 00:09:37,409
you know,
with <i>papi</i> and everything.

178
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:40,640
 <i>ay,</i> what? it's work.
we need the money right now.

179
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,285
yeah. no, i get it.
i just, um...

180
00:09:43,493 --> 00:09:45,077
you know, you haven't even
had a chance to take him

181
00:09:45,077 --> 00:09:46,633
to see dr. steve today.

182
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:48,660
 <i>ay,</i> betty, please,
stop worrying.

183
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,252
i got this, okay?
okay.

184
00:09:51,252 --> 00:09:52,956
look, i gotta go.
we'll discuss this later, okay?

185
00:09:52,956 --> 00:09:54,659
love you. bye.
(sighs)

186
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,941
mrs. meade.

187
00:10:00,408 --> 00:10:03,871
sorry. i have a system.
i didn't mean to snap.

188
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:06,289
i... i just have a lot
on my plate.

189
00:10:06,289 --> 00:10:09,791
well, i just came by
to say hello.
oh! you're back
from your trip.

190
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,811
how was your vacation
in paris?

191
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:15,078
well, i spent the entire time
being groped by perverts

192
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:16,981
in montmartre.
ooh, i'm sorry.

193
00:10:16,981 --> 00:10:17,627
why?

194
00:10:17,657 --> 00:10:20,260
the french still appreciate
something finely aged.

195
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,566
i spent a lot of time
with alexis and d.j.

196
00:10:22,566 --> 00:10:25,334
oh, betty, i was so sorry
to hear about your father.

197
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:28,668
how is he?
he's... good.
thank you for asking.

198
00:10:28,668 --> 00:10:30,429
he's got this cough,

199
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:34,398
but my sister's gonna take him
to see dr. steve.
dr. steve?

200
00:10:34,398 --> 00:10:37,209
yeah, he's our family doctor.
we've been seeing him for years.

201
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:39,966
dear,
i've had many doctors,

202
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:42,157
and the only ones i ever called
by their first names

203
00:10:42,187 --> 00:10:44,907
were slipping me prescriptions
for painkillers.

204
00:10:44,907 --> 00:10:48,353
oh, well, dr. steve
isn't like that.

205
00:10:48,353 --> 00:10:49,837
tell you what, betty--

206
00:10:50,395 --> 00:10:53,585
i'm on the board
of stuyvesant memorial.

207
00:10:53,585 --> 00:10:56,582
dr. farber
is <i>the</i> finest cardiologist in the city.

208
00:10:56,582 --> 00:10:59,138
why don't i just call and make
your father an appointment?

209
00:10:59,138 --> 00:11:02,068
oh, no. no, i could never
ask you to do that.

210
00:11:02,108 --> 00:11:05,038
and besides, we would
never be able to afford it.

211
00:11:05,068 --> 00:11:07,304
(chuckle
well, dr. farber works

212
00:11:07,304 --> 00:11:09,783
in the <i>meade</i> wing
of the hospital.

213
00:11:09,783 --> 00:11:11,923
it's not gonna cost you
anything.

214
00:11:18,205 --> 00:11:20,623
hey, guys!
i've got some good news.

215
00:11:20,653 --> 00:11:23,509
oh, good. us, too.
talked to dr. steve.

216
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:25,724
he said it's probably just
a cold, and <i>papi's</i> fine.

217
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,694
um, what did he do,
just listen to his chest,

218
00:11:29,694 --> 00:11:31,863
take some blood samples?
no. we didn't go in.

219
00:11:31,863 --> 00:11:33,773
we just talked to him
on the phone.
(coughing and hacking)

220
00:11:36,753 --> 00:11:37,914
i'm fine.

221
00:11:37,914 --> 00:11:39,716
hey, do you hear
a bluebird?

222
00:11:39,819 --> 00:11:42,611
it's night. it's winter.
i don't hear anything.

223
00:11:42,611 --> 00:11:43,722
well, maybe we should
go and check,

224
00:11:43,722 --> 00:11:45,355
you know, just in case?

225
00:11:45,923 --> 00:11:47,624
hilda, i thought
we were gonna talk

226
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:51,843
about you taking that job.
i have it
under control, betty.

227
00:11:51,843 --> 00:11:53,946
dr. steve said <i>papi</i> is fine.
it's a mild cough.

228
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:55,038
it hasn't moved to his chest.

229
00:11:55,038 --> 00:11:57,515
if it gets worse,
then i take him in.
but you haven't
even had a second

230
00:11:57,515 --> 00:11:59,314
to take him in to the doctor,
and apparently,

231
00:11:59,314 --> 00:12:02,971
you couldn't finish
a single thing on my list.
sorry, betty,
i thought things

232
00:12:02,971 --> 00:12:05,753
like "de-linting his sweaters"
could wait.

233
00:12:05,753 --> 00:12:07,013
what is that

234
00:12:08,242 --> 00:12:11,815
you didn't give him
his pills for today?
yeah, he can't take them
before he eats.

235
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,511
it upsets his stomach.
well, then why don't--

236
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:14,815
why don't--

237
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:17,235
just wanted
a little more tea.

238
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:20,417
uh... oh, i think the bird
went around that way.

239
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:22,387
oh, yeah. crazy bird!
 <i>(bird squawks)</i>

240
00:12:23,469 --> 00:12:25,579
look, claire meade got us
an appointment

241
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:29,337
with her cardiologist
tomorrow in the city.
okay, all right.

242
00:12:29,337 --> 00:12:31,793
so i'm supposed to give up
my job with the quinceaEra?

243
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,505
we still need the money.

244
00:12:35,275 --> 00:12:36,590
got my tea.

245
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,913
oh, good.

246
00:12:37,913 --> 00:12:39,840
i think i heard that bird
out front.

247
00:12:42,945 --> 00:12:45,372
i might not do things the way
that <i>you</i> want me to,

248
00:12:45,372 --> 00:12:46,831
but you can't be
betty bossypants

249
00:12:46,831 --> 00:12:49,025
when you're off at work
all day.
well, you know what, hilda?

250
00:12:49,025 --> 00:12:50,749
i only have to be
betty bossypants

251
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:52,886
when <i>nothing</i> gets done
around here.

252
00:12:52,886 --> 00:12:57,243
and don't call me
betty bossypants.
well, then stop trying
to control everything.

253
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:59,763
look, you don't want to take
 <i>papi</i> to the city? fine.

254
00:12:59,763 --> 00:13:02,602
i'll do it.
i'll take over.
you'll what?

255
00:13:02,602 --> 00:13:04,504
i'll take over with <i>papi.</i>
you don't wanna help?

256
00:13:04,504 --> 00:13:08,618
i'll just find a way
to do it all by myself.
oh, i would like
to see you try.

257
00:13:08,618 --> 00:13:09,840
i will.
fine.

258
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,934
fine!

261
00:13:27,832 --> 00:13:30,765
well, i guess there is something
everyone can agree on.

262
00:13:30,765 --> 00:13:34,475
dr. farber
is an excellent doctor, <i>papi.</i>

263
00:13:35,195 --> 00:13:37,754
mr. suarez,
how are you feeling?

264
00:13:37,754 --> 00:13:39,734
just a little chilly.

265
00:13:39,734 --> 00:13:42,318
is there some reason
it has to be so cold in here?

266
00:13:42,318 --> 00:13:44,898
yes. now i've reviewed
your chart.

267
00:13:44,898 --> 00:13:48,740
i'd like to run
some tests.
dr. steve was pretty sure
it's just a cough.

268
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,323
two weeks
after a quadruple bypass,

269
00:13:50,323 --> 00:13:54,430
you can never be
too careful.
yeah, and, <i>papi,</i> hilda only
spoke to dr. steve on the phone.

270
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,555
on the phone--terrific.

271
00:13:56,555 --> 00:13:58,772
that's how i order
chinese food.
(chuckles)

272
00:13:59,413 --> 00:14:00,726
breathe.
(inhales and exhales)

273
00:14:01,479 --> 00:14:03,142
all right. again.

274
00:14:05,495 --> 00:14:07,835
all right. i want an x-ray
to check for fluid in the lungs,

275
00:14:07,835 --> 00:14:11,307
an e.k.g., an echo,
and draw some blood.
c.b.c.,
check for dressler's?

276
00:14:11,307 --> 00:14:12,697
yeah.
dressler's?

277
00:14:12,697 --> 00:14:14,241
inflammation
of the pericardium.

278
00:14:14,241 --> 00:14:16,232
you did the right thing,
bringing your father in.

279
00:14:16,232 --> 00:14:17,595
who's next?

280
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,870
see? aren't you glad
we came in?

281
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,992
my butt is cold.

282
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:34,339
(connor) you were a killer
in there.

283
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,824
i'm continuously amazed
by you.

284
00:14:36,824 --> 00:14:39,202
well, that makes
the two of us. (chuckles)

285
00:14:39,768 --> 00:14:42,975
marc, don't just stand there
like a gay flagpole.

286
00:14:42,975 --> 00:14:44,491
we want to celebrate.

287
00:14:44,491 --> 00:14:47,971
go get something bubbly
and expensive.

288
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,087
yeah, it's what
i live for.

289
00:14:53,219 --> 00:14:55,241
how you convinced
the guerlain people

290
00:14:55,241 --> 00:14:59,636
to incase their ad buy
by 6% in this market...

291
00:14:59,636 --> 00:15:02,283
well, you said the advertisers
would never do it,

292
00:15:02,283 --> 00:15:03,851
and i saw it as a challenge.

293
00:15:03,851 --> 00:15:05,142
well, maybe when we meet

294
00:15:05,142 --> 00:15:07,579
with the jaeger-lecoultre people
this afternoon,

295
00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:10,378
i might get them
to increase <i>their</i> ad buy

296
00:15:10,378 --> 00:15:13,047
by, say... 7%.

297
00:15:13,047 --> 00:15:15,079
what about eight?
how about nine?

298
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:17,167
or maybe...
ten?

299
00:15:20,102 --> 00:15:21,601
yes.

300
00:15:21,756 --> 00:15:26,380
i want you to give me 10%.

301
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:37,632
ahem. collette!

302
00:15:37,632 --> 00:15:40,513
klaus! other klaus!

303
00:15:40,513 --> 00:15:42,997
you're early.
(laughs nervously)

304
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:45,624
(swiss-french accent)
jaeger-lecoultre has put us

305
00:15:45,624 --> 00:15:47,986
on a tight schedule, so...

306
00:15:47,986 --> 00:15:51,929
we were hoping that wilhelmina
could see us now.

307
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:54,981
oh, it's funny.

308
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:56,809
you'd think people who work
for a watch company

309
00:15:56,809 --> 00:15:58,862
would be precisely on time.
(laughs)

310
00:16:02,232 --> 00:16:03,832
follow me.

311
00:16:14,701 --> 00:16:15,908
you know what?

312
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,688
it's an american tradition

313
00:16:17,688 --> 00:16:20,058
to circle the building
three times

314
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:21,458
before a meeting.

315
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,212
sometimes four.

316
00:16:25,445 --> 00:16:26,912
well, it's a good thing
we got him in,

317
00:16:26,912 --> 00:16:31,175
because dr. farber's running
a bunch of tests.
what tests? is <i>papi</i> okay?

318
00:16:31,205 --> 00:16:33,062
yeah, but two weeks
after a quadruple bypass,

319
00:16:33,062 --> 00:16:34,972
you can never be
too careful.
(call waiting beeps)

320
00:16:35,845 --> 00:16:38,345
oh, hilda, that's work.
can i call you back?
work?

321
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,620
wait a minute. don't tell me
you're leaving <i>papi</i> there alone.

322
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,461
because i am up to my ears
in teenagers right now.

323
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:45,849
i cannot just run off.
no, hilda, i told you,
i can handle it.

324
00:16:45,849 --> 00:16:47,645
look, i'll stay here with <i>papi.</i>
i'll call you with the results.

325
00:16:47,645 --> 00:16:52,525
okay? bye. amanda?
hi, betty. some guy
from a photo lab called

326
00:16:52,525 --> 00:16:54,656
and said you messengered
your phone bill to him.

327
00:16:54,656 --> 00:16:56,995
(gasps) if he pays it,
can i send him our other bills?

328
00:16:56,995 --> 00:16:58,305
what?

329
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:04,658
 <i>s. meade,</i>
 <i>can i have that back?</i>

330
00:17:04,705 --> 00:17:06,988
(betty gasps) if daniel's photos
went to suzuki,

331
00:17:06,988 --> 00:17:09,455
then everything's gonna go
to the wrong place.

332
00:17:09,455 --> 00:17:11,753
amanda, i need your help.
and i would totally
help you,

333
00:17:11,753 --> 00:17:13,914
but i'm a little busy
covering daniel's desk

334
00:17:13,914 --> 00:17:16,353
like you asked me to.
i know, amanda,
but i'm at the hospital.

335
00:17:16,353 --> 00:17:19,577
i can't leave.
(gasps) oh, my god.
is it your heart?

336
00:17:19,577 --> 00:17:22,513
no, it's my dad. haven't we
had this conversation?

337
00:17:22,513 --> 00:17:24,110
i know, betty, but these things
get passed down.

338
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,777
they're <i>generic.</i>
look, i can't leave my father,
so i need your help.

339
00:17:27,777 --> 00:17:29,716
will you help me track down
some of these letters?

340
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,802
okay, fine,
what do you need me to do?

341
00:17:36,075 --> 00:17:38,733
marc, throw those people
out of the conference room.

342
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:41,275
i need to use it for
the jaeger-lecoultre meeting.

343
00:17:41,275 --> 00:17:43,845
actually, i'm...
in a good mood.

344
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,423
i'll throw them out
myself.

345
00:17:45,423 --> 00:17:46,738
about that...

346
00:17:46,738 --> 00:17:49,575
uh, collette and the klauses
have already come and gone.

347
00:17:49,575 --> 00:17:51,911
what? they came early?

348
00:17:51,911 --> 00:17:54,148
well... why didn't you
come get me?

349
00:17:54,148 --> 00:17:57,734
because you were busy snorkeling
in the great barrier reef?

350
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:01,080
so i was otherwise occupied.
you should've stalled them.

351
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,370
i tried,
but that's not the point.

352
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,704
i'm worried, you know,
that, you know...

353
00:18:04,704 --> 00:18:05,954
will... you know?

354
00:18:05,954 --> 00:18:08,986
marc, mince when you walk,
not when you talk. what?
i don't want it getting out

355
00:18:08,986 --> 00:18:10,421
that the most talented woman
in fashion

356
00:18:10,421 --> 00:18:13,992
is missing meetings because
her head is... elsewhere.

357
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:16,498
oh, because i missed
one meeting with them?

358
00:18:16,498 --> 00:18:18,193
our swiss friends
will not leave new york

359
00:18:18,193 --> 00:18:19,800
without an audience with me.

360
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,612
i'll call them.
it'll all be fine, you'll see.

361
00:18:22,861 --> 00:18:26,030
get, uh, klaus
on the phone or...

362
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,898
klaus.

363
00:18:30,896 --> 00:18:32,970
betty. uh, how's your dad?

364
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,061
he's getting tests done,

365
00:18:34,061 --> 00:18:35,829
and they won't let me see him,
so in the meantime,

366
00:18:35,829 --> 00:18:39,570
i've been dealing
with a little work snafu.
there was a work snafu, huh?

367
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:42,800
it's all taken care of.
amanda helped me.
oh. that's--that's great.

368
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,839
the only thing left
is something

369
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,289
i was hoping
i can get done tomorrow.

370
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:47,754
i have to get suzuki st. pierre
to swap out your vacation photos

371
00:18:47,754 --> 00:18:50,615
for the new picture
of the halston dress.
wait, wait.

372
00:18:50,615 --> 00:18:55,370
suzu-suzuki st. pierre...
has my vacation photos?
oh, no.

373
00:18:55,506 --> 00:18:58,256
you didn't ask me to print out
those type of photos, did you?

374
00:18:58,256 --> 00:18:59,434
again?

375
00:18:59,434 --> 00:19:01,901
 <i>coming up, more life-ruining</i>
 <i>gossip, but first...</i>

376
00:19:01,901 --> 00:19:04,297
betty, i have to tl you
something. i'm seeing molly.

377
00:19:04,608 --> 00:19:08,434
what, connor's mol?
look, she was with me
in st. barths.

378
00:19:08,434 --> 00:19:09,760
wait. <i>connor's</i> molly?

379
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,116
look, it's not
what you think, okay?

380
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:14,957
we are actually in love.
daniel, you're in love
with connor's molly?

381
00:19:14,957 --> 00:19:16,134
could you stop
calling her that?

382
00:19:16,134 --> 00:19:18,238
they stopped seeing each other
before we got together.

383
00:19:18,238 --> 00:19:21,607
well, does connor know
about you and...
no.

384
00:19:21,607 --> 00:19:23,076
this could be a huge disaster.

385
00:19:23,076 --> 00:19:25,400
i promised molly
i was gonna keep this a secret.

386
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,995
you have to get
those photos back for me.
now?

387
00:19:27,995 --> 00:19:30,863
betty, yes, now.
but, daniel,
i'm at the hospital.

388
00:19:30,863 --> 00:19:33,923
um, i have to wait--
betty, please, there has to be
something you can do.

389
00:19:35,449 --> 00:19:36,546
(sighs) okay, all right,

390
00:19:36,546 --> 00:19:38,399
i'll find a way
to get the photos back.

391
00:19:38,399 --> 00:19:40,098
i promise.
(beep)

392
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,470
(beep)
 <i>(woman) dr. maddox,</i>
 <i>dr. chester maddox,</i>

393
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,970
 <i>please go</i>
 <i>to the pharmacy.</i>

394
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,700
 <i>dr. chester maddox</i>
 <i>to the pharmacy.</i>

395
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:48,698
hold it right there, missy.

396
00:19:48,698 --> 00:19:51,910
no visitors
during medical tests.
oh, i know. i just--

397
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,565
i have to tell my dad
i have a work emergency

398
00:19:54,565 --> 00:19:57,301
that i gotta go deal with.
well, he's gonna be in there
for at least four hours.

399
00:19:57,301 --> 00:20:00,504
how you spend your time
is up to you.
okay, well,
can you just tell him

400
00:20:00,504 --> 00:20:03,005
that i'll be back
as soon as possible?
yeah, okay.

401
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:07,091
okay. okay.
you can do this, betty.

402
00:20:08,366 --> 00:20:09,501
no.

403
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:11,482
but--but why not?

404
00:20:11,482 --> 00:20:13,584
pictures of daniel meade
having an affair

405
00:20:13,584 --> 00:20:14,931
with the fiancE
of his c.f.o.--

406
00:20:14,931 --> 00:20:18,261
in my business,
we call that news, honey.
but she's not even
his fiancE anymore.

407
00:20:18,261 --> 00:20:20,474
they broke up before she went
on vacation with daniel.

408
00:20:20,474 --> 00:20:23,587
so see? no scandal.
or even <i>juicier</i> scandal.

409
00:20:23,587 --> 00:20:27,050
he stole her, and they ran away
on a sexy caribbean getaway.

410
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:29,970
all right, suzuki, can you
just do this as a favor to me?

411
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,764
do i know you?
betty suarez.

412
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:33,109
we've met, like,
a thousand times.

413
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:36,939
you've interviewed me...
sorry. i've been working
on this story for months.

414
00:20:37,228 --> 00:20:38,172
really?

415
00:20:38,172 --> 00:20:40,323
'cause these pictures literally
just fell into your lap.

416
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:42,621
just good, solid journalism
is what i say.

417
00:20:42,621 --> 00:20:45,140
and i'm going with the story
tomorrow.

418
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,655
so good-bye, benny.

419
00:21:19,298 --> 00:21:20,503
(normal voice)
what are you doing?
shh!

420
00:21:20,503 --> 00:21:22,146
marc, i was just trying
to borrow these.
b-b-b-b-b-buh!

421
00:21:22,146 --> 00:21:23,505
marc, what?!
(connor and wilhelmina laugh)

422
00:21:26,124 --> 00:21:28,966
oh. hello, marc...

423
00:21:29,754 --> 00:21:31,587
marc's <i>friend.</i>

424
00:21:31,587 --> 00:21:33,557
actually, it's--
hmm.

425
00:21:33,587 --> 00:21:35,287
marc's friend is fine.

426
00:21:42,027 --> 00:21:44,227
oh, my god.

427
00:21:44,257 --> 00:21:45,627
are they...

428
00:21:45,657 --> 00:21:48,487
no, they are absolutely not.
(laughs)

429
00:21:49,387 --> 00:21:50,809
 <i>okay.</i>

430
00:21:51,327 --> 00:21:54,697
but you have to swear
not to say anything to anyone.
(giggles)

431
00:21:55,487 --> 00:21:56,355
(gasps)
 <i>swear.</i>

432
00:21:56,355 --> 00:21:59,599
ow.
marc, you're hurting me.
am i?

433
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:00,556
not really.
ohh.

434
00:22:00,556 --> 00:22:02,414
but i get it.
you're serious.

435
00:22:02,414 --> 00:22:04,530
i'm not gonna
say anything to anyone.

436
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:08,154
god, why are you
being so weird anyway?
(grunts) why must god test
the pretty people

437
00:22:08,154 --> 00:22:10,443
so much more than
the regular lumpy people?

438
00:22:11,687 --> 00:22:15,505
this is supposed to be my year.
i got into y.e.t.i.

439
00:22:15,505 --> 00:22:17,775
willie is
co-editor-in-chief.

440
00:22:17,775 --> 00:22:20,720
i just don't want her star
to wane before i have a chance

441
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,919
to cash in on
having worked for her.

442
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:24,873
you know what i think?

443
00:22:24,873 --> 00:22:27,486
good things come
to those who wait.

444
00:22:27,486 --> 00:22:29,801
oh.
plus it helps being pretty.
take me.

445
00:22:29,801 --> 00:22:31,994
i have always wanted
to work daniel's desk,

446
00:22:31,994 --> 00:22:35,515
and now check me o.

447
00:22:35,901 --> 00:22:37,584
(telephone ringing)
do you need to get that?

448
00:22:37,832 --> 00:22:39,312
no, it's fine.

449
00:22:39,312 --> 00:22:41,118
it's just i've never
had to deal with a boss

450
00:22:41,118 --> 00:22:43,493
who cared more
about sex than work.

451
00:22:43,493 --> 00:22:46,495
actually, maybe this is what
working for daniel is like.

452
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:48,185
why are you looking at me?
be--

453
00:22:48,185 --> 00:22:52,870
oh, marc, there you are.
i need your help.
i need yours.

454
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,467
when daniel blows off a meeting
to go sleep with some floozy,

455
00:22:55,467 --> 00:22:57,837
what do you do?
what?
daniel doesn't do that.

456
00:22:57,867 --> 00:23:00,337
yeah, and this is my real nose,
which it totally is.

457
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:01,867
okay, so when daniel

458
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:04,930
gets "distracted by life,"
what do you do?

459
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:07,295
i just like to see those moments
as career opportunities.

460
00:23:07,295 --> 00:23:09,608
you know, a chance to step it
up, show daniel what i can do.

461
00:23:09,608 --> 00:23:13,189
why, is wilhelmina...
(scoffs) no, no, not at all.
why would you even say that?

462
00:23:13,189 --> 00:23:14,636
but she's a woman.
she has needs.

463
00:23:14,636 --> 00:23:18,850
get over, it betty. grow up.
ahem. what did you want?
i need to get
a gift for suzuki.

464
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,061
i accidentally sent him
something that i need back,

465
00:23:21,061 --> 00:23:22,495
and i just--i have to
do it fast so i can get back

466
00:23:22,495 --> 00:23:23,993
to the hospital and my dad,
and anyway,

467
00:23:23,993 --> 00:23:29,192
i thought you could help me.
a gift for suzuki st. pierre?
he's a serious journalist.

468
00:23:29,192 --> 00:23:31,957
he's not gonna take a bribe.
you need to blackmail him.

469
00:23:31,957 --> 00:23:35,087
what? bribery, blackmail--that's
not at i was talking about.

470
00:23:35,087 --> 00:23:37,663
ll, too bad,
'cause his ex works at meade,

471
00:23:37,663 --> 00:23:39,727
and that bitch'll dish.

472
00:23:46,722 --> 00:23:50,700
fabian? fabian, hi!
you don't know me,

473
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,343
uh, but you might be able
to help me with a problem.

474
00:23:52,343 --> 00:23:54,989
i understand
you dated suzuki st. pierre?

475
00:23:54,989 --> 00:23:57,083
i can't talk about that.

476
00:23:58,658 --> 00:24:00,053
but i thought
you said he'd dish.

477
00:24:00,053 --> 00:24:01,275
not if you approach him
like that.

478
00:24:01,275 --> 00:24:02,441
people who have dated
celebrities

479
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,769
are really secretive about it.

480
00:24:03,769 --> 00:24:06,242
hello, i should know.
you've never dated
a celebrity.

481
00:24:06,242 --> 00:24:09,605
as far as you know.
(muffled voice) jeremy piven.

482
00:24:09,605 --> 00:24:12,555
okay, he goosed you
on the subway once, amanda.

483
00:24:12,555 --> 00:24:15,264
you talk about it constantly.
(normal voice) the point is,
you have to make him talk.

484
00:24:15,264 --> 00:24:17,379
go put the heat on,
sister.
ah!

485
00:24:18,433 --> 00:24:22,040
fabian,
you have to... help me.

486
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,952
um, please?

487
00:24:22,952 --> 00:24:25,852
um, no, i don't.

488
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,263
you tell her
what she needs to know,

489
00:24:28,263 --> 00:24:30,888
or i will tell everyone
you have ambiguous genitalia.

490
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:31,965
oh, yeah, like a ken doll,

491
00:24:31,965 --> 00:24:34,642
and that's the kind of stank
that don't wash off.

492
00:24:46,397 --> 00:24:48,657
is this suzuki's address?
ow!

493
00:24:48,657 --> 00:24:52,412
um, no. suzuki st. pierre
does not live in jersey.

494
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:54,619
well, who lives here?

495
00:24:58,973 --> 00:25:00,622
oh, betty,
thank god i reached you.

496
00:25:00,622 --> 00:25:01,967
it is teenage chaos here,

497
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:04,186
but i just wanted to check
and see how <i>papi's</i> doing.

498
00:25:05,257 --> 00:25:08,808
um, he's fine.
the nurse says he's fine.

499
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:10,518
oh, good.

500
00:25:10,518 --> 00:25:11,923
can i talk to him?

501
00:25:11,923 --> 00:25:16,070
no. he, uh,
they won't let anybody see him

502
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,742
while he's getting
his tests done.

503
00:25:17,742 --> 00:25:19,368
oh. yeah, i get it.

504
00:25:19,368 --> 00:25:21,934
i get it. i'm just worried
about him, that's all.

505
00:25:22,118 --> 00:25:25,018
listen, betty, thank you.
i know you're crazy

506
00:25:25,018 --> 00:25:28,493
juggling dad and--and work
and everything.

507
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:30,769
hilda--
(woman) hilda, my hair!

508
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:33,851
i'm coming! betty, let me
call you back, all right?

509
00:25:33,851 --> 00:25:35,449
but keep me posted.
okay, bye.

510
00:25:35,449 --> 00:25:37,319
okay, bye.
(beep)

511
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,006
guess my photos aren't all that
important in the big picture.

512
00:25:43,006 --> 00:25:44,133
oh, they are, they are.

513
00:25:44,133 --> 00:25:46,235
i just have a lot
on my plate right now.

514
00:25:46,673 --> 00:25:49,907
so what is it
you're hoping to find here?

515
00:25:49,907 --> 00:25:52,140
i have no idea.

516
00:25:54,305 --> 00:25:58,281
"byron wu"?
daniel! you're not supposed to
just go through people's mail.

517
00:25:58,281 --> 00:26:00,311
no, we want to find out
who lives here. who's byron wu?

518
00:26:00,311 --> 00:26:03,223
i don't know. maybe...
suzuki's boyfriend?

519
00:26:11,697 --> 00:26:13,345
(whispers) come here.

520
00:26:20,532 --> 00:26:23,584
(man) hey, hey!
nice hustle today, kiddos.

521
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:24,924
now let's get dressed
get inside,

522
00:26:24,924 --> 00:26:27,945
and i'll go grill some brats.
all right.
you heard your father.

523
00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:29,469
(lowered voice)
betty, is that suzuki?

524
00:26:29,469 --> 00:26:31,638
(lowered voice)
that's his wife and kids?

525
00:26:39,073 --> 00:26:40,469
hi, suzuki.

526
00:26:40,469 --> 00:26:43,218
or should we say "byron"?

527
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,313
oh, crap.

528
00:26:46,153 --> 00:26:48,774
(suzuki) hit it, hit it,
hit it! whoo!

529
00:26:49,197 --> 00:26:50,653
that's my boy.

530
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:54,033
so when i graduated
from columbia j-school,

531
00:26:54,033 --> 00:26:56,722
you know, i wanted to be
woodward, bernstein.

532
00:26:56,722 --> 00:26:57,766
but the only jobs available

533
00:26:57,766 --> 00:27:00,894
were britney this,
angelina that.

534
00:27:01,182 --> 00:27:02,886
but isn't that
the stuff you love?

535
00:27:02,886 --> 00:27:04,271
it's the stuff suzuki loves.

536
00:27:04,271 --> 00:27:07,374
wait. so suzuki st. pierre
is made-up?

537
00:27:07,374 --> 00:27:09,844
you think "fashion buzz" would
go near a guy like me?

538
00:27:09,874 --> 00:27:11,319
i mean, look at me.

539
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:13,304
(effeminate voice)
but as a fabulous, bitchy queen,

540
00:27:13,304 --> 00:27:16,528
the fashion world welcomed me
with open, well-toned arms.

541
00:27:17,556 --> 00:27:19,386
that's creepy.
byron?

542
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:21,859
don't forget to take the garbage
out when you're done.

543
00:27:21,859 --> 00:27:23,530
(normal voice)
yeah, no prob.

544
00:27:24,216 --> 00:27:27,386
so down to brass tacks.
daniel, bessie--
betty.

545
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:29,953
betty. you know my secret.
what do you want?

546
00:27:29,953 --> 00:27:32,777
well--
we are not here
to blackmail you.

547
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:35,942
we're not?
no, but we do need your help.

548
00:27:35,942 --> 00:27:38,656
those photos could destroy
people's lives, <i>byron.</i>

549
00:27:39,713 --> 00:27:42,196
you have your own secret.

550
00:27:42,196 --> 00:27:43,956
you should understand.

551
00:27:43,986 --> 00:27:45,916
(boy) you want me
to try for it?

552
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:48,016
(laughs)
soft!

553
00:27:48,056 --> 00:27:50,946
(boy) i didn't think so.

554
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:54,516
(daniel)
that was nice work, betty.

555
00:27:54,556 --> 00:27:56,745
so, daniel,
how long do you plan

556
00:27:56,745 --> 00:27:58,905
on keeping this whole
molly thing a secret?

557
00:27:58,905 --> 00:28:00,358
i don't know.

558
00:28:00,456 --> 00:28:04,516
sometimes honesty isn't always
the best choice, i guess.

559
00:28:04,556 --> 00:28:06,491
i understand that.

560
00:28:06,491 --> 00:28:10,559
it's just... secrets kind of
have a way of getting out.

561
00:28:20,316 --> 00:28:22,856
don't even bother with klaus,
either one of them.

562
00:28:22,886 --> 00:28:24,621
collette's the one
with the real power.

563
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:26,647
the ice queen
of lake geneva.

564
00:28:26,647 --> 00:28:29,057
well, i have a feeling
you'll be able to melt her.

565
00:28:29,057 --> 00:28:31,406
just, uh, flirt
with her a little bit.

566
00:28:31,406 --> 00:28:33,318
you'd be comfortable
with that?

567
00:28:33,318 --> 00:28:35,941
of course.
it's just business.

568
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:38,645
well, i'm not sure i'd be able
to pull that off.

569
00:28:38,645 --> 00:28:40,682
i can't just turn it on
for anybody.

570
00:28:40,682 --> 00:28:44,246
really? you've flirted
with me a million times.

571
00:28:44,246 --> 00:28:47,485
that's because i meant it,
because it was you.

572
00:29:02,353 --> 00:29:06,127
so we have
been waiting for...

573
00:29:07,709 --> 00:29:10,044
ten minutes.

574
00:29:10,368 --> 00:29:12,316
(clears throat)
well, perhaps if wilhelmina had

575
00:29:12,316 --> 00:29:16,142
one of your beautiful, elegant,
timeless, handcrafted watches...

576
00:29:23,443 --> 00:29:25,324
we'll come back later.

577
00:29:25,324 --> 00:29:26,992
wait.

578
00:29:29,927 --> 00:29:32,067
since wilhelmina is obviously delayed

579
00:29:32,067 --> 00:29:38,465
why don't i take you through our proposal?

580
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,459
you speak french?

581
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:44,280
actually,
that's all the french i know,

582
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,027
but if you give me
just a minutes,

583
00:29:46,027 --> 00:29:50,038
i know that i can show you
why "mode" and jaeger-lecoultre

584
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,347
are meant to be together.

585
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:12,577
excuse me.
where's my father?

586
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:13,276
he left.

587
00:30:13,276 --> 00:30:16,995
he left? but you said he'd
be in there for four hours.

588
00:30:16,995 --> 00:30:19,471
i guess he was done earlearly.
well, where did he go?

589
00:30:19,471 --> 00:30:21,462
i'm sorry. i don't know
what to tell you.

590
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,301
(beep)
what?

591
00:30:30,301 --> 00:30:31,435
hilda?

592
00:30:31,435 --> 00:30:33,588
i think
i might have lost dad.

593
00:30:45,189 --> 00:30:46,189
all right.

594
00:30:46,189 --> 00:30:48,683
somehow we have to find a way
to get through a whole day

595
00:30:48,683 --> 00:30:52,652
without <i>that</i> always happening.
nothing wrong with creating
a little anticipation

596
00:30:52,652 --> 00:30:54,520
for our swiss friends.

597
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,944
well, it looks to me
like your assistant's doing

598
00:30:56,944 --> 00:30:59,342
a pretty good job
of entertaining 'em.

599
00:31:01,642 --> 00:31:04,312
and, oh, this is the best part.
you're gonna love this.

600
00:31:04,342 --> 00:31:06,912
this is very exciting.
so what we do is we should--

601
00:31:06,942 --> 00:31:09,512
ah, bonjour, <i>mes amis.</i>
bonjour.

602
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:11,572
ah, collette.
mwah. mwah.
mwah. mwah.

603
00:31:11,612 --> 00:31:14,985
klaus! klaus. mm.

604
00:31:14,985 --> 00:31:17,194
i had no idea you were here,

605
00:31:17,194 --> 00:31:19,212
which is particularly tragic,

606
00:31:19,242 --> 00:31:21,872
since i specifically told
my assistant to call me

607
00:31:21,912 --> 00:31:23,842
as soon as you all arrived.

608
00:31:23,872 --> 00:31:26,976
this is... (singsong voice)
beginning to be a problem.

609
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,348
(chuckles, normal voice)
so if it happens again,

610
00:31:29,348 --> 00:31:32,737
it'll be back to spritzing
perfume at the makeup counter.

611
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,740
(laughs)
that will be all, marc.

612
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:39,379
nice to look at, but you could
sit a picasso behind his desk

613
00:31:39,379 --> 00:31:41,427
to do the same job.
(collette laughs)

614
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:44,844
how could you have lost him?

615
00:31:44,844 --> 00:31:46,242
you promised me you
weren't gonna leave him.

616
00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:48,764
i know, but there was
this emergency at work,

617
00:31:48,764 --> 00:31:51,772
and i might've maybe left
for just a minute.
betty, i--

618
00:31:51,812 --> 00:31:54,242
i know, i know. you're mad
at me. i'm mad at me, too.

619
00:31:54,272 --> 00:31:56,412
but can we just try
and find <i>papi?</i>

620
00:31:56,442 --> 00:31:58,632
oh, look, there's dr. farber.
dr. farber! hi!

621
00:31:58,632 --> 00:32:01,972
do you know where my dad is?
yeah, see, my sister
sort of lost him.

622
00:32:02,012 --> 00:32:05,405
uh, i talked to your dad
maybe... maybe two hours ago,

623
00:32:05,405 --> 00:32:09,670
but once his tests are
completed, he's free to go.
and you have no idea
where he went?

624
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,912
can't be far.
two weeks after major surgery,

625
00:32:11,942 --> 00:32:14,248
he's not gonna be running
a marathon. (laughs)

626
00:32:16,264 --> 00:32:19,445
look, i wouldn't worry about
him. his tests came back normal.

627
00:32:19,445 --> 00:32:22,539
he's gonna be totally fine.
oh! that's great. thank you.

628
00:32:22,539 --> 00:32:26,604
not a problem.
did you hear that?
 <i>papi's</i> gonna be fine.

629
00:32:26,604 --> 00:32:30,832
yeah. so he didn't have to come
to the hospital at all.

630
00:32:38,967 --> 00:32:40,747
hilda, where are you going?

631
00:32:40,747 --> 00:32:42,558
the doctor said
 <i>papi's</i> gonna be fine!

632
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:44,342
yeah, i heard what he said.

633
00:32:44,372 --> 00:32:46,342
well, then what is
wrong with you?

634
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,565
he was already fine...
until you came in and decided

635
00:32:51,565 --> 00:32:53,969
we had to take him to
some fancy manhattan doctor.

636
00:32:53,969 --> 00:32:56,612
and i thought for a second,
okay, maybe betty's right.

637
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,560
maybe we need to be
more nervous.

638
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,992
but you got me scared
for no reason.

639
00:33:00,992 --> 00:33:03,641
well, what was
i supposed to do?

640
00:33:03,641 --> 00:33:06,144
if something's wrong,
then we have to know about it.

641
00:33:06,144 --> 00:33:07,625
i'll tell you what you could ??

642
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:09,912
you could have stopped trying
so hard to control everything

643
00:33:09,912 --> 00:33:11,575
that you scared me
half to death.

644
00:33:11,575 --> 00:33:14,925
hilda, if there is a problem,
then we can't just ignore it.

645
00:33:14,965 --> 00:33:19,331
you always do this.
and you always make me feel
like everything i do is wrong,

646
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:20,939
like if i don't
do things your way,

647
00:33:20,939 --> 00:33:23,586
then i don't love <i>papi.</i>
when have i ever said that?

648
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:26,299
it's not what you say,
it's how you act.

649
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:28,364
this is exactly like
when mom was sick.

650
00:33:28,364 --> 00:33:32,656
everything had to be your way.
hilda, when mom got sick,
you disappeared.

651
00:33:32,656 --> 00:33:34,213
you went off with santos
or wherever,

652
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:37,235
and i stayed home
and took care of <i>papi.</i>
like i'm doing now.

653
00:33:37,681 --> 00:33:40,111
you're in manhattan.
you got your job.

654
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:43,118
you got your apartment.
where are you?

655
00:33:43,865 --> 00:33:45,895
where am i?

656
00:33:45,895 --> 00:33:50,204
i am here!
i have been here every day!

657
00:33:50,204 --> 00:33:52,451
do you have any idea
what i have had to give up

658
00:33:52,481 --> 00:33:54,964
so that i could be
at home helping out with--

659
00:33:54,964 --> 00:33:57,841
you want to talk
about sacrifice, betty?

660
00:33:57,841 --> 00:34:01,909
i live at home.
i work at home.

661
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:05,564
and now with <i>papi</i> sick, i gotta
fight you to take one job.

662
00:34:05,564 --> 00:34:08,718
well, i need your help. i guess
i can't do it all by myself.

663
00:34:08,718 --> 00:34:11,457
yeah, i guess you cat.

664
00:34:12,505 --> 00:34:14,441
what?

665
00:34:16,048 --> 00:34:18,300
you know what bothers me
the most, betty?

666
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:21,010
for all your lecturing...

667
00:34:22,153 --> 00:34:24,763
you weren't even there.

668
00:34:25,423 --> 00:34:27,953
i was the one in ambulance.

669
00:34:27,953 --> 00:34:30,486
(crying) i was the one--
i was holding his hand,

670
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:31,747
and--and i thought
he was gonna die.

671
00:34:31,747 --> 00:34:34,559
and you know where you were?
you were in the city.

672
00:34:34,593 --> 00:34:37,619
you were at some... party.

673
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:40,060
that is not fair, hilda.

674
00:34:43,025 --> 00:34:46,118
don't you think it kills me
that i wasn't there?

675
00:34:46,923 --> 00:34:49,918
i think about it
every single day.

676
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,793
it's justin. hello?

677
00:34:59,793 --> 00:35:02,634
mom? grandpa's home.

678
00:35:05,522 --> 00:35:08,562
okay. <i>papi's</i> fine.
he's at home.

679
00:35:10,622 --> 00:35:11,954
all right.

680
00:35:12,622 --> 00:35:14,310
love u.

681
00:35:38,063 --> 00:35:40,042
"bluebird"?

682
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:43,462
(chuckles) come on.
i'm not stupid.

683
00:35:43,462 --> 00:35:46,854
look, i know you're fighting,
but what i can't live with

684
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:48,943
is that you're fighting
because of me.
 <i>papi,</i> honestly--

685
00:35:48,943 --> 00:35:51,017
 <i>papi,</i> that's not true.
please.

686
00:35:51,017 --> 00:35:55,012
now you both are strong,
intelligent, capable women,

687
00:35:55,012 --> 00:35:56,911
but you can't do it all.

688
00:35:57,896 --> 00:36:01,948
so... i've decided.

689
00:36:01,948 --> 00:36:04,717
i'm hiring a nurse to help
take some of the burden.

690
00:36:04,717 --> 00:36:07,290
what?
what?
we cannot afford that.

691
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:11,324
and you're not a burden.
stop. we can afford it.

692
00:36:11,324 --> 00:36:13,477
i went to the medicaid office
and found out that

693
00:36:13,477 --> 00:36:15,487
they'll help pay
for a rt-time nurse.

694
00:36:15,487 --> 00:36:18,370
help? what's that
supposed to mean?

695
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,735
it means we'll manage.

696
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:25,571
look, i... i can't control
what happens to me.

697
00:36:25,818 --> 00:36:28,406
but i can control some things,

698
00:36:28,406 --> 00:36:31,196
and i won't
come between you two.

699
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:58,871
you could use a trim.

700
00:37:14,248 --> 00:37:17,857
i'm sorry i wasn't there
that night, hilda.

701
00:37:18,972 --> 00:37:21,897
if i could go back
and change it, i would.

702
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,988
i don't know
what i would have done...

703
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:51,788
a little gift

704
00:37:51,818 --> 00:37:54,422
from our new friends
at jaeger-lecoultre.

705
00:37:54,951 --> 00:37:58,188
we landed the account.
nice work.

706
00:37:58,496 --> 00:38:01,260
great. now i won't be late
to any meetings.

707
00:38:01,418 --> 00:38:03,848
uh, i'm sorry.
did i miss something?

708
00:38:03,888 --> 00:38:05,488
you're my assistant.

709
00:38:05,518 --> 00:38:07,911
you took a hit for me.
i brought you a fancy gift.

710
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:10,757
i expect gratitude,
not attitude.

711
00:38:10,757 --> 00:38:12,436
i'm sorry, willie...

712
00:38:13,295 --> 00:38:15,448
but that was humiliating
for me.

713
00:38:15,488 --> 00:38:16,944
i was doing really well
in there--

714
00:38:16,944 --> 00:38:18,730
it doesn't matter how well
 <i>you</i> were doing.

715
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,488
they didn't come here to be
pitched by some assistant.

716
00:38:20,488 --> 00:38:23,664
they came here to be pitched
by wilhelmina slater.
well, maybe i wouldn't
have had to step in

717
00:38:23,664 --> 00:38:27,404
if you hadn't been o--
if i hadn't what?

718
00:38:30,288 --> 00:38:33,044
it's just that i thought
after four years,

719
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:35,653
i might be able to--
getting thrown under the bus

720
00:38:35,653 --> 00:38:38,719
to make me look good
is part of your job...

721
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:41,596
unless, of course, you'd like
to find another one.

722
00:38:42,056 --> 00:38:44,776
no, i don't want
another job. i...

723
00:38:47,518 --> 00:38:50,794
never mind. you're right.
(whispers) thanks.

724
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:02,607
hey, sweetie.

725
00:39:04,988 --> 00:39:06,564
okay, what's the matter?

726
00:39:06,564 --> 00:39:09,018
so you know
how we dodged a bullet

727
00:39:09,048 --> 00:39:11,660
with our vacation photos?
uh-huh, yeah.

728
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:14,007
look at "page six,"
behind heidi and spencer.

729
00:39:14,007 --> 00:39:17,455
you're cut out of the picture,
but i'm not.

730
00:39:30,818 --> 00:39:32,288
are you done with that?

731
00:39:54,518 --> 00:39:57,182
i'm off. lunch with tom ford.

732
00:39:57,182 --> 00:39:58,748
oh, but, uh,
proenza schouler

733
00:39:58,748 --> 00:40:00,203
are coming to meet
with you at noon.

734
00:40:00,203 --> 00:40:02,665
(sighs) those ad meetings
are so tiresome.

735
00:40:02,665 --> 00:40:04,519
why don't you take it?

736
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:09,192
if you think you can handle it.
of course, i can always--

737
00:40:09,192 --> 00:40:11,358
give my love to tom
and his chest hair.

738
00:40:35,348 --> 00:40:37,939
cable we can totally
just steal from upstairs.

739
00:40:37,939 --> 00:40:39,381
oh, and we both
have cell phones,

740
00:40:39,381 --> 00:40:40,600
so we don't need a landline.

741
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,513
plus i gave that number out
to too many weirdos anyway.

742
00:40:43,513 --> 00:40:47,067
my god, we have so many.
there's electric and gas

743
00:40:47,067 --> 00:40:49,318
and maintenance
and bergdorf's.

744
00:40:49,318 --> 00:40:52,548
god, it is so hard to know which
one to sacrifice, you know?

745
00:40:52,588 --> 00:40:54,902
mm-hmm. amanda?

746
00:40:57,018 --> 00:40:59,650
i have to tell you something.

747
00:41:04,148 --> 00:41:05,888
you're moving out.

748
00:41:05,918 --> 00:41:07,948
how'd you know?

749
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,866
because your family
needs you right now...

750
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,718
and you're good like that.

751
00:41:17,688 --> 00:41:20,022
yeah.

752
00:41:20,518 --> 00:41:26,348
* a dream of togetherness 

753
00:41:26,388 --> 00:41:32,588
* turned into
a brighter mess *

754
00:41:32,618 --> 00:41:36,848
* a faint sign,
my spoken best *
