1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,700
Previously on "ugly betty",

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,500
Wilhelmina is back.

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,200
I ??? Wilhelmina as
creator director of mode.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,200
What?

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,800
You can write
an article for "hot flash."

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,400
300 words by tomorrow morning.

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,000
- I gotta get ready
for the p.T.A. Thing this morning.
- Since when are you on the p.T.A.?

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,300
- Since she has a crush
on my gym teacher.
- You wanna hang out sometime?

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,200
Henry and i agreed
a clean break would be best.

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,600
- You kissed me.
- Yeah, well, you kissed me back.

11
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,400
I don't wanna be
the rebound guy.

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,800
I wanna be the guy.

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,400
Betty.

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,500
Me?

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,700
You want me
to play on your team?

16
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,800
- But i've never even played before.
- That's okay.

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,000
And mona's so good.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,300
<i>- She's got really strong leggs.
- We don't need mona's legs.
We need you, betty.</i>

19
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,300
<i>Really? You need me?</i>

20
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,300
Mm-Hmm.

21
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,500
Okay.

22
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,800
Yes. Uh, yes, i-I'll play.

23
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,300
Okay, ladies, line up.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,300
Thanks, kimberly.

25
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,100
Get behind the human shield!

26
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,000
Where's the human shield?

27
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,600
What?

28
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,300
No, no. No, stop that!

29
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,100
Aah!

30
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,500
And that is why
i am not a fan of team sports,

31
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,800
And why i will not be playing

32
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,400
In the annual
"'mode' vs. 'Elle'

33
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,800
- Softball game to benefit charity."
- Well, that's just pathetic.

34
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,000
No, gio. It was traumatic.

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,800
<i>I can't even think
about that day</i>

36
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,100
Without
getting panic attacks,

37
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:39,000
- And who cares if i play in the game?
- Daniel does. He even came down
to my deli to recruit me.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,100
I guess this softball team
is daniel's baby.

39
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,000
<i>He loves holding a trophy over
his head while people cheer.</i>

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,600
Well, i just thought it would be
something fun for us to do

41
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,900
<i>- As a couple.
- We're not exactly a couple yet.</i>

42
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,200
I told you.
I wanna take it slow.

43
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,600
We're not exactly friends.

44
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,200
No,

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,500
But we're in
an exploratory phase.

46
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,400
Oh, okay, explorer.

47
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,500
So when do i get to take you out
on an official first date?

48
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,600
Soon.

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,700
Well, it better be
very soon.

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
- I'm going to italy for a month.
- What?

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,900
What's the big deal?

52
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,200
You're the one who said
we're not a couple.

53
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,900
I said, "exploratory phase."

54
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,700
Look,
it's what mario batali did

55
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,500
When he needed
to discover himself,

56
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,600
You know,
find his own unique flavor.

57
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,400
It's all part
of my 5-Year plan.

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,900
Well, wow.
That's... really exciting...

59
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,300
And great.

60
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,400
- What are you looking at?
- The next step in my 5-Year plan.

61
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,100
My very first
published article ever!

62
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,300
- Here you go.
- I think it's near the front.

63
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,000
Okay, maybe more
in the middle.

64
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,200
All right.
Not so much the middle.

65
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Let me see.

66
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,300
A bunch of ads
for old lady creams...

67
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,500
Ah, here it is-

68
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,300
"Young at any age
by... "

69
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,000
- "Betty suarez."
- Betty suarez.

70
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,100
Wow. It's a little smaller
than i imagined

71
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,400
And completely rewritten.

72
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,900
"Natch"?
I didn't write "natch."

73
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,200
I wrote "naturally."

74
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,500
Who says "natch"?

75
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,700
Ah, yes. "Natch."

76
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,700
I want
to be honest with you.

77
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,600
The idea for the article
was great.

78
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,800
The execution, not so much.

79
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,800
It was too... safe.

80
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,800
"Safe"?

81
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,400
Okay.

82
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,500
Well, um...

83
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,800
Thank you for
the constructive criticism,

84
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,400
And thank you
for the opportunity.

85
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,700
Betty, what do you want
to be when you grow up?

86
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,000
Wh-

87
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,100
I... want to be you.

88
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,100
You do?

89
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,900
Mm-Hmm. I want to own
my own magazine like you.

90
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,000
Why?

91
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,900
Because i love magazines.

92
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,900
I just-I always have.
Uh, they speak to me.

93
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,800
And i wanna do that
for other people.

94
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,700
I wanna speak to them
and touch their lives.

95
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,100
Well, i have no doubt

96
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,500
That you will achieve
whatever you want,

97
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,000
But, betty, you're never
going to do it by playing safe.

98
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,200
You're going to have to start
taking some risks,

99
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,300
And it's not just
with your work,

100
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,100
But also with your life.

101
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,400
* baby, hurry up,
'cause i can't... *

102
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,200
You know, i always thought
i hated tater tots,

103
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,800
But when i got out of school,
i found myself craving them.

104
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,900
Well, how about that jell-O
with the fruit in it?

105
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,300
- Mnh-Mnh. That was gross.
- Yeah.

106
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,000
Did you bring any?

107
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,700
Straight
from the fine chefs...

108
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,100
Of the p.S. 350 cafeteria.

109
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,000
Oh, you are
a true romantic, coach.

110
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,900
You know,
you can call me tony.

111
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,000
I like calling you coach.

112
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,100
- Yeah?
- Mm-Hmm.

113
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,100
* i just wanna fall in love *

114
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,200
You are a rock, woman.

115
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,900
Excuse me?
I am far from a rock.

116
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,100
- I am one fine gem.
- Yeah, well, if you hadn't
skipped science class,

117
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,300
You would know
that it takes a lot of heat

118
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,200
To turn a rock into a gem.

119
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,500
- It also takes a lot of time.
- And pressure.

120
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,200
Okay. Enough.

121
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,300
I went
through a lot this year,

122
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,000
- So i wanna take it slow.
- Fine.

123
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,600
I'll see you saturday.

124
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay.

125
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,500
* baby, i will give you more *
* work *

126
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,600
* then you do your homework *
* work *

127
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,300
* get up on the dance floor *
* work *

128
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,400
* if you do your homework *
* work *

129
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,600
* baby, i will give you more *
* work *

130
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,500
<i>* entiendo means i get it *</i>

131
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,300
<i>* siempre means
that i won't forget it *</i>

132
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Hey.
Good job on the uniforms.

133
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,500
The girls aren't gonna
wanna wear flats, though.

134
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,800
- I suggest a high-Heeled cleat.
- Yeah, well, that sounds practical.

135
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,600
- Have you been here all night?
- A couple of nights, actually.

136
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,400
There's a lot of work
to be done

137
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,000
- On the madelon de bie presentation.
- Yeah, well, you don't have to kill
yourself doing it.

138
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,900
- Yes, i do. We need the account.
- Look, all i'm saying is,

139
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:44,100
- You have a really strong creative director.
- No. I told you no wilhelmina.

140
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,900
She wants my job.
She wants my magazine.

141
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,200
She probably even wants
my softball team.

142
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,700
- I don't trust her.
- She isn't the only one you don't
seem to be trusting lately.

143
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,100
Alexis, what do you expect?

144
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,200
You turned your back on me
when you gave her a title.

145
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,200
- Daniel
- I have a presentation to finish.

146
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,100
How cute am i in this?

147
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,100
Pretend you're a man
for a second,

148
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,400
- And tell me how hot i look.
- You look fine, but this is
not working for me.

149
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,500
I like the "v," but it is
doing nothing for my bustline.

150
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,900
Oh, hey, betty.
Great piece in "hot flash."

151
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,100
You totally captured
that old lady voice.

152
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
- * natch *
- * natch *

153
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,600
I didn't write that.
Oh, hey, amanda.

154
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,000
You're in charge
of the cheerleading squad

155
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,700
For the "mode"
softball team, right?

156
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,400
See, i really don't want
to play on the team.

157
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,600
You wanna be the mascot?

158
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,700
Um, no to the mascot,

159
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,600
<i>But i have pep to spare.</i>

160
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,600
Oh, my god.

161
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,900
- You are not asking me-
- Gasp. I think she is.

162
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,500
Please?

163
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,200
Well, if you want
to be a cheerleader,

164
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,900
You have to try out first.
Toe touch. Go.

165
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,500
Right herkie. Left herkie.

166
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,600
Star jump. Jump. Jump.

167
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,900
Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump.

168
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,400
Hey, everyone,
we were wrong.

169
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,900
<i>She can get off the ground.
I have proof.</i>

170
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,500
Unfortunately, we don't have
any uniforms in your size,

171
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,600
But thank you so much
for trying out.

172
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,700
Mm.

173
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,200
<i>Uh, pardon, s'il vous plaît.
Parlez-Vous français?</i>

174
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,900
Oh, little french boy.

175
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,700
Do you mind if i
dress you up like a doll

176
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,700
<i>- And put makeup on you?
- Quol?</i>

177
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,100
Exactly.

178
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,300
I don't understand.

179
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,700
What is 23?

180
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,600
23 what?

181
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,300
Oh, that's the average age
of the wealthiest subsector

182
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,400
Of the urban demographic
we're targeting.

183
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,300
See? It's right here
on the chart. See?

184
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,000
I am confused.
Is anyone else confused?

185
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,900
<i>Ja.</i>

186
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,500
<i>Of course you're confused,
because it's confusing.</i>

187
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,700
Thorough? Yes.
Accurate? Indeed.

188
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,500
But it just makes
my head hurt.

189
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,400
Madelon,
we've done a terrible job

190
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,700
Appealing to your head.

191
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,500
- Perhaps we can appeal to your heart.
- No.

192
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,800
What daniel
is neglecting to say is,

193
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,300
This weekend is

194
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,100
The "mode" versus "elle"
charity softball game.

195
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,900
What if we donated the proceeds
to engelen van kinderen,

196
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,600
The children's charity
you cochair in the netherlands?

197
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,900
As an expectant mother myself,

198
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,500
I care a great deal
about the lives of children,

199
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,300
Especially the poor
and the disadvantaged.

200
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,300
And what do you want
in return?

201
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,700
A 1-Year commitment
to 20 pages per issue,

202
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,300
<i>At a 30% reduced rate,
of course. Goed?</i>

203
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,000
<i>Erg goed.</i>

204
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,800
Hmm.

205
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,400
She made me look
like an ass.

206
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,200
I have been working
on that all week.

207
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,100
- She stole the show.
- Yeah, but it was my show.

208
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,700
<i>Daniel, you know
that i hate to say this,</i>

209
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,300
But i don't think
that witch wilhelmina

210
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,300
Is going anywhere
anytime soon.

211
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,200
<i>Maybe you need to find
a way to work with her.</i>

212
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,900
Betty, wilhelmina
doesn't work with people.

213
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,800
She works against them.
There she is,

214
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,400
Probably
bad-Mouthing me already.

215
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,100
"Daniel sucks. Daniel's boring.

216
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,700
Daniel doesn't know
how to do his job."

217
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,800
Okay, i'm gonna let you
work through this one.

218
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,000
I have lunch with gio,

219
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,600
So i'll be back when you're
done with the voices, 'kay?

220
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,100
Oh, betty,

221
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,700
Congratulations
on your article.

222
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,100
Natch. Funny.

223
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,900
I didn't even write that.

224
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,500
And then mrs. Meade says
that my article was too safe.

225
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,800
Well, what would've been
the risky thing to do?

226
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,300
Shorten more words-
"Fabu," "brill"?

227
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,900
<i>Sounds like
you're in a difficult sitch.</i>

228
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,400
Just kidding.

229
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,900
What are you doing?

230
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,500
- I thought we were gonna go
grab some lunch.
- We're gonna have a little batting lesson.

231
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,800
If you're gonna play
in that softball game,

232
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,000
You need to practice.

233
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,200
<i>No. No way. Not doin' it.
I'd rather be the mascot.</i>

234
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,500
Okay,
you don't have to.

235
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,600
I mean, if you want
to play it safe...

236
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,200
Pardon, monsieur.

237
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,600
Daniel meade?

238
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,600
<i>- Can i help you?
- S'il vous plaît.</i>

239
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,300
<i>Parlez-Vous le français?
Je voudrais parler avec vous.</i>

240
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,800
Sorry. I skipped
my french classes in school.

241
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,700
<i>C'est important, monsieur. Je
crois que tu connais ma mère...</i>

242
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,900
All right. Betty.

243
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,000
<i>Et je suis venu de france.
C'est très, très important.</i>

244
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Does anyone speak french?

245
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,100
You know, it would really help
if you kept your eyes open.

246
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,000
Gio, i hate this.
Do i have to do it?

247
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,300
Yes, you have to.

248
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,500
Now stop saying no
and start saying yes.

249
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,200
Focus on the ball.

250
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,500
Okay.

251
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,200
Aah! I hit it! I hit it!
Whoa! Whoa!

252
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,100
- You did. That was a great one.
- Yes!

253
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,900
Yes! Yes!

254
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,300
- Yes! Yes!
- Whoa!

255
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,300
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

256
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,200
You did it. Let's go.
Hit it again.

257
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,700
- You see what you can do when
you say yes to things?
- Yes.

258
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,300
- Come to rome with me.
- Yes!

259
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,500
What?

260
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,200
Oh!

261
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,500
Are you serious?

262
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,900
Very.

263
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Betty, i want us to have

264
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The most romantic
first date ever.

265
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,400
And what could be
more romantic than rome?

266
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,200
What do you say?

267
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,200
Okay.

268
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,900
Yes.

269
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,600
Yes, i'll go to rome.

270
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,200
* so far away,
so far away *

271
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,600
<i>Je m'appelle daniel.</i>

272
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,200
He says his name is daniel.

273
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,900
<i>- Ha. Sweet. Like me.
- Ma maman est lucie chainet.</i>

274
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,500
He says his mother's name
is lucie chainet.

275
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,700
<i> Elle est mannequin. Ils se sont
rencontrés ?Paris.. ></i>

276
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,400
<i>- She is a model.
- Il y a quelques années.</i>

277
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,100
He says you met her
in paris many years ago.

278
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,500
Uh, it's vaguely familiar.

279
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,400
<i>Elle est décédée...</i>

280
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,100
She has died recently.

281
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,800
Oh, well, that's-That's really,
um, that's a bummer.

282
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,800
Would you like me
to translate that?

283
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,300
No.

284
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,200
<i>Je suis en voyage scolaire
?New york></i>

285
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,500
<i>Je me suis échapp?/I>>
pour retrouver mon pére></i>

286
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,000
He's in new york
on a trip with his school.

287
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,300
He separated from them

288
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,500
Because he wanted
to meet his father.

289
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,400
Uh, okay. I got-
I mean, yeah.

290
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,600
We could help him
find his father, i guess.

291
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,700
Daniel.

292
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,900
You are his father.

297
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,700
One-You are looking
at the newest member

298
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,400
Of the "mode" softball team!
* ooh, ooh *

299
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,000
That's right. I know it's crazy,
but i just signed up.

300
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,700
And two-Don't freak out,

301
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,300
But gio-My gio,
pickle napkin gio-

302
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,700
He asked me to go
to rome with him for a month,

303
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,900
And i said yes!

304
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,800
Oh, god, daniel.
You're already freaking out.

305
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,000
Look, it'll be fine.
I know this terrific temp,

306
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,500
And i'll totally be
reachable...

307
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,900
Oh, hey. Who's the kid?

308
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,000
And why are you
wearing eye shadow?

309
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,500
He says he's my son.

310
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,200
What? Oh, my god.

311
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,400
You trumped me.

312
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,200
His mother was a model
i slept with years ago.

313
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,000
She just died.

314
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,100
That's terrible.

315
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,100
It is,
but he's not my son.

316
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,800
You know how many times
this happened to my father?

317
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,400
People just show up,
pretend to be related.
True.

318
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,000
But, daniel, your father
did get around a bit.

319
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,900
I mean, he managed to father
a child after his death.
Betty.

320
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:21,500
- Sorry, but you guys are really fertile.
- Look, either someone is after my money,

321
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,600
Or they're just messing
with my head and...

322
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,400
And i think i know
who it is.

323
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
So what you're saying is,

324
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,300
I researched
every woman you slept with

325
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,700
Found out which one
had an illegitimate child,

326
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,900
Waited for the woman to die
and then arranged

327
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,400
For the child to come
on a class trip from europe

328
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,000
Just to upset you?

329
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,900
You are not gonna
beat me here, wilhelmina.

330
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,500
You may own
a third of the company,

331
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,400
But i am still editor-In-Chief
of this magazine.

332
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,500
You have no moves
in this chess game.

333
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,600
Daniel, i play chess.

334
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,200
You're playing checkers.

335
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,500
Either way...

336
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,700
You have no moves.

337
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,400
Well, that choo choo has gone
off the rails, right?

338
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,600
I mean, it's not like
there's some twisted scheme

339
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,600
That you haven't told
me about, is there?

340
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,400
There is. Oh, my god.

341
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,800
You are diva brilliance.

342
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,600
Marc...

343
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,300
I didn't plan this.

344
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,400
Oh, god must truly love us.

345
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,300
Just in our time of need,

346
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,100
He drops a little french boy
into our laps.

347
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,300
<i>Go, god.
And viva la france.</i>

348
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,900
So what are you thinking?

349
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,200
Well, daniel
clearly doesn't want

350
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,800
To acknowledge
the child is his,

351
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,000
So let's use that
to our advantage.

352
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,200
Check and mate.

353
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,300
Queen me.

354
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,400
Oh, marc.

355
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,700
<i>Vous êtes plus grand
que j'imaginais.</i>

356
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,600
Yeah, i still
don't speak french.

357
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,200
He said you're taller
than he imagined.

358
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,900
That's nice.
Are we almost done here?

359
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yes, we are.

360
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,600
We'll have the results back
in a couple of weeks.

361
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,400
Okay. Great.
Excellent.

362
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,900
Uh, the day's over.
I am outta here.

363
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,500
Daniel...
what about daniel, jr.?

364
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,300
What? I called the school.
They're gonna pick him up.

365
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,900
Besides, i got three models
waiting for me at lotus.

366
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:26,800
- What? You mean, you don't want
to spend any time with him?
- Betty, i told you. This is a scam.

367
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,800
We have to go
through the motions,

368
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,000
But that kid is not my son.

369
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,300
Daniel...

370
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,800
What?
He doesn't speak english.

371
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,000
He doesn't have to.

372
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,200
Good evening my little friend.

373
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,800
Good evening.

374
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,200
I'm sorry your father
left you alone.

375
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,300
Are you hungry?

376
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,600
Would you like to have
dinner with us?

377
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,000
<i>Oul.</i>

378
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,700
<i>- Bon.
- Bon.</i>

379
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,800
Mom, i think
you're being a tease.

380
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,400
Shut up.
I just really like him,

381
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,500
So i'm playing hard to get.

382
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,200
<i>Which is
a very good idea, mija.</i>

383
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,500
I mean, what do you know
about this coach diaz?

384
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,500
I know he's hot
and super sweet,

385
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,900
And i know he has
a degree in wellness training,

386
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,700
So he's smart.

387
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,200
And he doesn't sweat ever.
It's bizarre.

388
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,600
We call him lizard man.

389
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,600
- Hello?
- Hey, betty. So what do
you think of this coach diaz?

390
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,300
Um, i'm going
to rome with gio.

391
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,800
- What?
- Oh, my god.

392
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,200
- Aunt betty, you're crazy.
- I know.

393
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,200
- Betty, how are you gonna afford this?
- I've been saving a little,

394
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,100
And-And we're gonna
do things on the cheap.

395
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,800
- And where are you gonna sleep,
in the same bed with him? - Dad, we
haven't really discussed that part yet.

396
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,600
<i>- Well, don't you think you should?
- Ay, papi,
she's 24. It's not like she's a virgin.</i>

397
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,300
- Wait. What?
- Hilda.

398
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,600
Okay. Uh, i'll get
the recap later. Bye.

399
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,200
Dad, look, i don't know
all the details yet,

400
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,000
But it just feels right,
and-And when am i ever

401
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,100
Gonna get an opportunity
to do this again?

402
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,400
<i>Ay, dios mio.</i>

403
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,500
- Do you support this?
- Hey, i would love to go to italy.

404
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,200
<i>Gracias.</i>

405
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,200
Uh, aunt betty?

406
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,900
There's someone
at the door for you?

407
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Oh, my god.
What-What are you doing here?

408
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,000
Will you marry me, betty?

409
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,000
- Um, i'm-
- Shocked?

410
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,500
Totally.

411
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,100
Betty

412
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,200
Henry, why are you
doing this to me right now?

413
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,600
I am just starting
to get over you.

414
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,200
Don't. Don't get over me.
I'm not over you.

415
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,600
I love you, betty.

416
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,500
- No.
- I love you, and we can be together.

417
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,300
- I want you to move to tucson with me.
- Wha-What?

418
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,600
I've given this
a lot of thought.

419
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,700
There's no reason not to do it.
I know you can be happy there,

420
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,500
And i have a friend
that works at a magazine.

421
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
I gave him your resume?
He was impressed.

422
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,600
And he can give you a job
as a writer,

423
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,700
And the pay is good, so you can
still help out with your family,

424
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,500
- And you can visit them, and
they can visit you.
- Henry-

425
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,300
Just say yes.
Just say yes.

426
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,000
I know this is huge
and crazy.

427
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,300
Yes.

428
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,800
Betty,
it would be amazing.

429
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm going back on monday.

430
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,600
I want you to be
on that plane with me

431
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,400
As my fiancee.

432
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,400
Are you out of your mind?

433
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,900
- You're gonna miss the opportunity to
go to rome? - I thought you didn't want
me to go to rome.

434
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,500
That was before henry proposed.
You're only 24 years old.

435
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,200
<i>- You're not getting married.
- Papi, why not?</i>

436
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,600
- She found true love. He wants
to be with her. - She's too young,
and it's too far.

437
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,800
Well, you left mexico
to be with the woman you loved,

438
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,500
<i>- And that was much farther, and you
were younger. - I was not much younger,
and this is totally different.</i>

439
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,800
No, it isn't, so when
the shoe is on the other foot-

440
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,000
- Guys
- Shoes, what are you talking about? Shoes?

441
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You know what?
This is all ridiculous.

442
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,500
She's not going to rome
with some guy she barely knows,

443
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:24,000
<i>- And she's not getting married and moving
to tucson. - She is standing right here.</i>

444
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,500
And she's asking
for your advice,

445
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,100
Not your approval.

446
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,400
Good...

447
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,900
Because you're not
getting any from me.

448
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,000
Good morning, fashionistas.

449
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,500
For those of you just waking up
or just going to bed,

450
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,000
We have some breaking news.

451
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,600
Just when we thought
the meade family drama

452
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,100
Couldn't get any juicier,

453
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,200
<i>Along comes some
freshly squeezed jus d'orange.</i>

454
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,100
Daniélmeade is

455
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,400
The illegitimate love child
of daniel meade

456
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,900
And the late hand model
lucie chainet,

457
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,600
Whose famous fingertips
scratched through

458
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,900
Many a bare back in some
scandalous mid-90s perfume ads.

459
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,100
So how did daniel
embrace the news?

460
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,000
<i>He didn't! He partied
the night away at lotus,</i>

461
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,100
Promoting this weekend's

462
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,600
"Mode"/"elle"
charity softball game.

463
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,300
<i>- I hope he didn't leave his glove
at home. - Oh, no, she di'int!</i>

464
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,500
Meanwhile, little orphan danny
walked the streets of manhattan,

465
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,500
Digging through dumpsters
for food.

466
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,200
<i>So far,
no comment from daniel sr.</i>

467
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,700
<i>Papa, can you hear me?</i>

468
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,100
<i>- He's got your jawline.
- That's all, fashionistas. Stay
tuned for more updates.</i>

469
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,100
- Mom.
- What?

470
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,100
There is a resemblance. Hmm?

471
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,200
Now why are you fighting this?
I have a grandson.

472
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,500
I'm very happy about that,
and you should be, too.

473
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,900
<i>He's not my kid.
I don't know how this got out.</i>

474
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,900
- I called the school. They were gonna pick
him up. - Madelon de bie just pulled out.

475
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,700
- What? Why?
- Uh, let's see.

476
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,700
We got her on the hook
with a children's charity,

477
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,300
And now it's all over the news
that you abandoned your kid.

478
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,400
- He's not mine. - Hey, i was on
that trip with you in paris.

479
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,400
I remember you drooling
all over his mother.

480
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,700
- "Yeah, i'm gonna go bang the hand
model!" - That's very classy, daniel.

481
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,600
We need to do
some major damage control here.

482
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,400
I need you
to keep a low profile.

483
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,300
We're gonna tell madelon

484
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,500
- That you're taking a
leave of absence.
- Alexis.

485
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,000
- Mom, stay out of this.
- I can't believe you.

486
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,900
When an advertiser
threatened to pull out

487
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,100
Because you became a woman,
i stood by you.

488
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,400
- We almost lost this magazine. - Then i
guess i'm learning from your mistakes.

489
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,600
You slicing ham with those pants?
What?

490
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,700
<i>Papi, that crease
cannot get any sharper.</i>

491
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,000
She's behaving like a child.
She's trying
to figure out what to do with her life.

492
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,700
She's too young
to know what to do.

493
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,200
Is this really
about how old she is,

494
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,400
Or you not being ready
to lose her?

495
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,100
<i>Look, i know how difficult
it is to find love.</i>

496
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,500
And when you find someone, you
gotta seize that opportunity.

497
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,700
You can't just sit around

498
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,200
And act like it's gonna be there
the next day,

499
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,200
Because sometimes-Boom!
It's gone.

500
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,500
And then you have nothing.

501
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,200
Hey.

502
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,800
You okay?

503
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,500
Yeah.

504
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,300
Where you going?

505
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,800
<i>I'm gonna seize
my opportunity.</i>

506
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,000
Oh, god. Daniel, i just heard
about this leave of absence.

507
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,200
What does that mean?

508
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
It means nothing.
A couple of weeks.

509
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,500
Good time for you to take
a vacation.
Are you okay?

510
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,700
Yeah. It's daniel.

511
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,500
Look, daniel,

512
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,700
It's gonna take a couple weeks
for the results to get back.

513
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,700
- So i mean, until then
- Betty, i don't need to take a paternity test to know.

514
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,500
I'm his father.

515
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,200
This is a letter daniel's mother
wrote to him before she died.

516
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,400
I had it translated.

517
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,200
She wanted him to know
who his father is

518
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,100
And if anything happened to her,
to come find me.

519
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,800
What am i gonna do?

520
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,200
Daniel, you always complained

521
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,400
About how cold and distant
your father was.

522
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,700
You don't have to be that.
You can be there for your son.

523
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,200
And he just lost his mom,
so he really needs you.

524
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,400
Betty.

525
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,200
Thanks.

526
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,600
And in case you thought
i'd forgotten about rome,

527
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,900
Here is an all-Expense-Paid trip
for you and gio.

528
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,500
First-Class tickets,
five-Star hotels, the works.

529
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,400
Oh, god.

530
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,800
Oh, god. Oh, god.

531
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,700
Is that a good "oh, god"
or a bad "oh, god"?

532
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,500
Oh, i'm sorry, daniel.
I'm so sorry.

533
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,700
It's just that
henry showed up last night,

534
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,700
And he asked me to marry him
and move to tucson.

535
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,300
Betty, that's...

536
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,200
Uh, how-How is that?

537
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,500
I don't know.

538
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,700
I don't know. I don't know.

539
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,000
What do i do?

540
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,400
I- I'm the last person you should
ask for relationship advice.

541
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,800
I know.

542
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,500
But you're my friend,
and i need to know.

543
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,600
I think you should go to rome.

544
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,800
Because i shouldn't
be with henry?

545
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,900
No, because i can't imagine
being here without you.

546
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,800
I'm a little biased. Sorry.

547
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,700
So what are you gonna do?

548
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,300
No, no, no.

549
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,900
<i>Thank you
for being so understanding.</i>

550
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,000
<i>Bedankt vaarwel.</i>

551
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,300
Is everything okay?

552
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,700
That was madelon de bie. It took
a lot of finessing on my part,

553
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,800
But she's finally
back on board

554
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,400
Now that daniel's
taken a step back.

555
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,200
Thank you, wilhelmina.

556
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,700
Oh, of course.
It's absolutely fine-

557
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,000
Me taking care of everything

558
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,300
While, uh, daniel's off
dealing with his little bastard.

559
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,500
I understand now
more than anything

560
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,600
The importance of family.

561
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,800
But to be honest,

562
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,500
It's just been a lot easier

563
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,500
Getting things done around here
by myself.

564
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,100
What are you saying?

565
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,100
It's just-Alexis,
you and i-We had a plan.

566
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,900
We were gonna take over
the company together.

567
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,200
And, of course, i understand
why you turned on me.

568
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,200
You chose your brother.
But you're in charge now.

569
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,400
You need to do what's best
for the magazine.

570
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,100
And that would be
getting rid of daniel?

571
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,300
Well, that's a little harsh.

572
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,500
Just think of it more
as a...

573
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,500
A reassignment to another
position in the meade empire

574
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,200
That might be a better fit.

575
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,800
If there's
one thing i've learned,

576
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,000
Family will always be there,
alexis.

577
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,800
But with daniel running things,
i'm not sure "mode" will.

578
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,300
Hello, mr. Meade.

579
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,600
Thank you for coming.
It's nice to meet you.

580
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,200
Here is daniél's passport
and his document.

581
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,000
I can trust you will
take good care of him?

582
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,800
Betty?

583
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,200
Dad.

584
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,000
I wanted to talk to you.

585
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,300
Oh, my god.
It's gorgeous!

586
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,100
It's dominican amber.

587
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,600
A fine gem
for another fine gem.

588
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,200
Oh, i love it.

589
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,900
I love it. Thank you.

590
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,200
Yeah, i was gonna
give it to you on saturday,

591
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,400
But then you called,
and... well, i'm glad

592
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,300
Because i've been
wanting to talk to you.

593
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,700
You know what, coach?

594
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,100
I think we're done talking.

595
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,600
What, now you want
to take it slow?

596
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:47,300
Uh, hilda, i-I don't know
how to say this.

597
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,600
I'm...

598
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,200
Not single.

599
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,500
You're joking.

600
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,700
No, it's not like that.

601
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,700
Okay? We-We were separated
for a while.

602
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,600
W- We got back together.
We fell apart again.

603
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,300
It's just been so rocky.
Are you together now?

604
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,700
But, hilda-

605
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,700
Stop. Stop.
My fianc?Died a year ago.

606
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,900
This is the first time that
i have opened up to someone,

607
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,800
And you're telling me that you're married?
I didn't know this was gonna happen.

608
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,400
This is the story of my life.
Hilda, i just wanted you to know

609
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,600
Because i feel
like i'm falling for you.

610
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,400
Oh, here it is.

611
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,800
<i>Le building de empire state.</i>

612
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,700
It's a, um,
really big building.

613
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,500
<i>Grand. Yeah?
Oul.</i>

614
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,800
And over here...
oh, there's central park.

615
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,100
Oh, and over here we ha-

616
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,700
Oh, there's someone having
a little fun in the window.

617
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,600
Put that away for now.

618
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,400
Um, so do you like
to go to the movies?

619
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,300
<i>You know, movies...
le cinema?</i>

620
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,800
<i>Ah, oul.
I like, uh, johnny depp,</i>

621
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,700
"Matrix," "transformers."

622
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,600
Yeah.
Uh, shia labeouf, no good.

623
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,700
<i>No.
Megan fox, hot. Super.</i>

624
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,200
Hot chicks.
I know where you get that from.

625
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,500
Give me five. Yeah!
Good. We're getting somewhere.

626
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,700
Um, how about sports?
Do you like any?

627
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,200
Um, soccer?

628
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,500
Sorry. Uh, football?

629
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,900
Uh, no, no.
Uh, um, baseball.

630
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,300
Hey, this is
your first halloween.

631
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,900
Aw. Why am i wearing pearls
and lace gloves?

632
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,100
You were baby madonna.

633
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,000
It was your sister's idea.

634
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,000
Oh, i didn't know you and mom
went to the grand canyon.

635
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
It's a photo booth
in coney island.

636
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,600
Your mother always dreamed
about going there,

637
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,100
But she never got the chance.

638
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,100
This is us at the community pool
one summer.

639
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,000
It's what i wanted
to show you.

640
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,200
You wanted to jump off
the high board,

641
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,500
And i wouldn't let you,
and you got so mad.

642
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,000
And then i turn around

643
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,500
And there you were,
standing at the edge.

644
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,000
I think i remember that.

645
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,800
I was so scared.

646
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,800
You were,
but then you jumped.

647
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,800
And it was okay.

648
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,100
I wanted to protect you,

649
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:09,000
But you knew what you wanted
to do, and you did it.

650
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,900
Dad, i don't know
what i want this time.

651
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,300
<i>Amor.</i>

652
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,000
What do i do?

653
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,500
<i>I can't tell you that, mija.</i>

654
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,000
I can tell you
that i love you,

655
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,500
That i'll support you
either way.

656
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,300
But this is your decision,
betty.

657
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,800
You can't listen
to anyone else.

658
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,600
You just need
to search deep inside,

659
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,300
And then take a deep breath...

660
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,000
And jump.

661
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,700
It's the athletic event
of the fashion season,

662
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,500
<i>The only athletic event
of the fashion season-</i>

663
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,800
The "mode" versus "elle"
charity softball game.

664
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,000
Who will win? Who cares?

665
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,600
It's about who's wearing what,
and more importantly,

666
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,500
Who will naomi campbell smash
in the head with a baseball bat?

667
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,400
Hey! I just want
to reach out to all my fans

668
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,200
Who've been missing me
and facebooking me.

669
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,800
I hear you,
and i miss you, too,

670
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,400
And i'm gonna be back
with a new single

671
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,700
Or reality show or a sex video
very, very soon.

672
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,100
I love you!

673
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,100
We love you.

674
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,000
Go, mode!
Whoo! Go, mode!

675
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,300
Who is that?

676
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,900
-* i should have seen the signs *
- Daniel.

677
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,500
Oh, you brought daniel jr.

678
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,600
Well, he likes baseball,
and he likes models,

679
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,500
<i>I thought, why not?
Naomi campbell, uh, très sexy.</i>

680
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,100
Mm. My french is actually
getting better. I understood him.

681
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,800
Well, i think it's really great
that you guys are-

682
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:54,000
Oh, um, i'll see you guys out
on the field, okay? All right.

683
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Sometimes
she's a little weird. Sorry.

684
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,400
Is, uh, marc?

685
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,400
<i>Très drôle.
"M-O-D-E."</i>

686
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Uh, funny.

687
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,100
You know marc?

688
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,200
How...

689
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Ready?

690
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,800
Okay.

691
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,500
We're "mode." We're cool.

692
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,300
We'll take your team to school.

693
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,600
You're "elle." You smell.

694
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,000
Your team can go to...

695
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,300
Hell.

696
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,500
Go, "mode"!
Whoo! Go, "mode"!

697
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,200
Whoo! Was that as good as
it felt?
It felt really good.

698
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,500
Oh, i just wish
we could get higher.

699
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,600
I know. We need something solid
that we can jump onto.

700
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,500
We need, like, a bench or a trunk or something.
Betty, perfect timing. We have to jump on you.

701
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,900
I don't have time for this.
Oh!

702
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,400
Oh, my god.
Show some team spirit.

703
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,100
Guys, you can't just jump
on people. It's rude.

704
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,500
Am i crazy, or are...
you avoiding me?

705
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:47,100
Why would you say that? Well,
because you just looked at me and ran.

706
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,300
Betty, if you don't want
to go to rome with me,

707
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,200
Just-Just tell me.

708
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,100
Gio, i do, but-
Betty!

709
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,900
Henry.
Hey.

710
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,000
What are you doing here?
"Mode" needed more guys on the team, so i volunteered.

711
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,200
I volunteered, too.
I thought it'd be a fun thing

712
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,400
For me and betty to do
before we go to rome.

713
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,500
Rome?
Yeah.

714
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,700
I just asked betty
to marry me.

715
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,200
What?

716
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,300
Wha-

717
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,700
"Modies" take the field.

718
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,400
Play ball, bitches!
Betty!

719
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,300
Time for the opening pitch.

720
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,000
Daniel meade, editor-In-Chief
for "mode" magazine,

721
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,300
Is on the mound.

722
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,400
Daniel meade?

723
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,900
Hello?

724
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,800
Daniel meade?

725
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,700
You had him
pick through that garbage.

726
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:44,300
You leaked the video to the press.
Oops. Busted.

727
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,700
Take a look around, wilhelmina.
You see these people?

728
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,300
<i>That's my team, my magazine.
Stop trying to push me out.</i>

729
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,100
Oh, trying?
Daniel, darling, it's done.

730
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,900
Your sister
already pushed you out.

731
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,500
No, she asked me
to keep a low profile

732
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,800
Until we got
the madelon de bie account back.

733
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,300
Oh, so you don't know?

734
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,100
There's no longer
a low profile.

735
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,500
<i>It's no profile.
Mm.</i>

736
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,800
You're no longer
editor-In-Chief of "mode."

737
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,700
I am.

738
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,400
Hello? "Mode," who's pitching?

739
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,700
I'll pitch.

740
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,500
It appears we have a last-Minute
change on the roster.

741
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,800
Wilhelmina slater
will be pitching for "mode."

742
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,800
And first up to bat
for "elle" magazine-

743
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,100
Joe zee.

744
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,500
Strike three!

745
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,800
I must have been distracted
by how fat you look in white.

746
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,500
<i>Oh, no, she di'int!</i>

747
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,600
Next.

748
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,200
How could you do this to me?
It's what's best for the company.

749
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,000
A company i'm still
a third owner of.

750
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,700
We'll find something else
for you to do,

751
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,100
But "mode" just isn't it.

752
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,300
And next up for "elle,"
robbie myers.

753
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,400
Nice try, robbie.
Bite this.

754
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,400
Love you, too, dear. Next!

755
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,300
Nice catch, willie.
Way to handle a ball.

756
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,500
Next up,

757
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,900
The most infamous member
of the supermodel trinity-

758
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:45,300
The ferocious and fierce
naomi campbell.

759
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,900
* get up out of your seat *
* your seat *

760
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,800
* come on
up to the dance floor *

761
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,100
* i've got something so sweet *

762
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,000
* i'll be your one stop *
* one stop *

763
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
* candy shop *
* candy shop *

764
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
* everything *
* everything *

765
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,300
* that i got *
* that i got *

766
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,500
Don't worry, darling.
I wield this bat with love.

767
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,800
Oh, god.

768
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,900
Bono!

769
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,000
Not now, darling.
I'm playing cricket.

770
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,800
Okay.

771
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,000
Give it to me, mama.
I'm gonna give it to you.

772
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,200
I got it!

773
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,000
Good morning,
mrs. Grubstick.

774
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,100
I made you breakfast in bed.

775
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,800
Blue corn pancakes
with prickly pear syrup-

776
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,100
Tucson specialty.

777
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,400
Thank you, henry.

778
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,800
Mm-Hmm. How'd you sleep?

779
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,300
Well, i had this dream.

780
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,600
It was so vivid.
It was about the softball game.

781
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,800
Oh, you mean
the best softball game ever?

782
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,200
Yes, the day i decided
to marry you.

783
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,700
Aren't you glad you made
the right choice? Mm...

784
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,000
Hey.
Yes.

785
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,600
Oh, hey, about this weekend.

786
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,200
I thought maybe you,
me and little nate

787
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,200
Could take a road trip
down to the coolidge dam.

788
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,400
You're never too young
to start learning

789
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,900
About hydroelectric power. Oh, henry, my
article's due this weekend. I'll be working.

790
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,600
Oh.

791
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,500
Unless i start right now,
and i finish it all today.

792
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,700
Oh, by the way, did you pick up
that dandruff sham...

793
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:55,800
...poo?

794
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,400
Okay, i have got
to comp daniel sandwiches

795
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,200
For the rest of his life!

796
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,700
This is the nicest hotel room
i've ever stayed in.

797
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,300
What's wrong?

798
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,400
Um, nothing. Nothing.

799
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,100
I... i was just having
this weird déj?Vu or something.

800
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,800
I was imagining my life
if i had ended up in tucson.

801
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,000
Ha!
Aren't you glad you didn't?

802
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,800
Come here.

803
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,200
All right, let's look
at the itinerary for today.

804
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,500
We're gonna hit the pantheon...
ooh.

805
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,300
And then the fontana di trevi,
and then we're gonna go

806
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,000
To this amazing bakery
in campo dei fiori.

807
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
They make an unbelievable white
pizza. Ooh. Can we go there first?

808
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,200
Whatever you want.

809
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:41,900
Betty.

810
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,300
What are you doing?

811
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,500
Henry?

812
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,000
Yeah, betty.
What are you doing?

813
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,200
I want an answer.

814
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,200
What? I need to know,
betty. Make a choice.

815
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,300
You can't keep me waiting
like this. Make a choice.

816
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,900
Make a choice. Make a choice.

817
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,700
Make a choice! Make a choice!

818
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,000
Is she all right?

819
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,400
I know what to do.

820
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,100
* there's only so much
you can learn in one place *

821
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,200
* the more that i wait *

822
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,000
* the more time that i waste *

823
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,900
* i haven't got
much time to waste *

824
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:37,200
* it's time to make my way *

825
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,900
* i'm not afraid
of what i'll face *

826
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:45,000
* but i'm afraid to stay *

827
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:53,500
* i'm going down my own road,
and i can make it alone *

828
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,900
* i'll work and i'll fight *

829
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:02,400
* till i find
a place of my own *

830
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,000
* are you ready to jump? *

831
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,800

* my sisters and me *

838

* the only thing
you can depend on *

839
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:35,200
* is your family *

840
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,600
* life's gonna drop you down *

841
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:43,600
* like the limbs of a tree *

842
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,000
* it sways and it swings *

843
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,100
