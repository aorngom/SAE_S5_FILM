1
00:00:00,404 --> 00:00:02,482
 <I>Previously On "Ugly Betty"...</I>
(Betty) You Have
A Secret Husband?

2
00:00:02,482 --> 00:00:04,998
Booze And Pills Weren't Enough?
I'm Sick.

3
00:00:05,149 --> 00:00:07,469
If I Can't Marry
Into The Meade Family,

4
00:00:08,284 --> 00:00:11,600
I Will Give Birth To An Heir.

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,683
We Need To Find A Surrogate
We Can Control,

6
00:00:13,683 --> 00:00:17,601
Someone Who's Desperate
For Money.
I'm The Editor-In-Chief
Of "Mode,"

7
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:20,727
And This Office
Is Now A Nursery.
But I'm Your Father,

8
00:00:20,727 --> 00:00:23,658
You Are My Son,
And We're In This Together.

9
00:00:23,658 --> 00:00:25,859
You're Telling Me
That You're Married?
I Just Wanted You To Know

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,203
Because I Feel
Like I'm Falling For You.

11
00:00:28,551 --> 00:00:31,145
Betty, Hey!
Welcome To Our New Home.

12
00:00:31,145 --> 00:00:33,625
I Really Want To Take On
More Responsibility.

13
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:37,488
I Just... I Thought That
That Was Gonna Be At "Mode."

14
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:51,992
Daniel...
(Man Speaking Indistinctly)

15
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:53,925
When I Said
That "Player" Magazine

16
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:55,901
Should Show Women
In A More Professional Light,

17
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:58,069
This Isn't Exactly
What I Had In Mind.

18
00:00:58,069 --> 00:01:01,885
Betty, That's Your Concept--
America's Hottest Lawyers.

19
00:01:01,885 --> 00:01:05,418
Um, I Pihed America's
Top Female Attorneys.

20
00:01:05,418 --> 00:01:07,341
Look, I Know This Is
"Player" Magazine,

21
00:01:07,374 --> 00:01:10,918
But Does <I>Every</I> Spread Have To Be
Women In Skimpy Bras?

22
00:01:10,918 --> 00:01:13,898
You Know What? You're Right.
I Hadn't Thought Of That.

23
00:01:13,898 --> 00:01:16,241
Let's Lose Those Bras,
Please.
(Man) Lose 'Em.

24
00:01:16,274 --> 00:01:18,207
No, That's Not What I Meant!

25
00:01:23,302 --> 00:01:25,497
That's Not What I Meant.

26
00:01:26,314 --> 00:01:28,353
What Are You Working On?

27
00:01:29,134 --> 00:01:31,249
Nothing. Just Doodling,
You Know.

28
00:01:31,426 --> 00:01:32,744
Is That "Mode"?

29
00:01:32,744 --> 00:01:34,172
No, It's Just, Uh,

30
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:36,649
It's Just The Mock-Up
For Wilhelmina's First Issue,

31
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:39,853
You Know.
I Knew It, Daniel. A Part Of You
Wants To Be Back At "Mode."

32
00:01:39,853 --> 00:01:42,680
No, Look. I Just Want To See
What Wilhelmina's Up To.

33
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,352
You Know Exactly
What She's Up To--

34
00:01:44,352 --> 00:01:47,305
Firing, Scheming,
Looking For A Puppy To Kick.

35
00:01:47,305 --> 00:01:49,738
Well, Then I'm Happy
To Be Away From It.

36
00:01:50,272 --> 00:01:52,290
See? Happy.

37
00:01:56,872 --> 00:01:59,005
It's Daniel's Copy
Of The Mock-Up.

38
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:01,846
Oh, Crap. I Forgot
We Still Send It To Him.

39
00:02:01,846 --> 00:02:04,972
I'll Make Sure
We Take Him Off The List.
Uh, No.
That's Not Why I Here.

40
00:02:05,005 --> 00:02:07,400
You See, Alexis, There Are
A Lot Of Notes In Here,

41
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,559
And They're Good.
I'm Sure He Has
A Lot Of Notes.

42
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:13,151
It's Wilhelmina's First Issue,
And He Hates Wilhelmina.

43
00:02:13,151 --> 00:02:15,084
No, See,
These Aren't The Notes

44
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:17,047
Of Somebody Who Wants
To Get To Wilhelmina.

45
00:02:17,382 --> 00:02:19,349
"Cover Is Too Obscure.
Will It Sell?

46
00:02:19,382 --> 00:02:22,609
Pull Up Key Ads. Where Is
'"Mode" Girl On Madison'?"

47
00:02:22,737 --> 00:02:25,386
Alexis, He Cares
About This Magazine.

48
00:02:25,386 --> 00:02:26,409
He Misses "Mode."

49
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:29,315
I Mean, He Won't Admit It,
But He Belongs Here.

50
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:32,563
I Appreciate Your Loyalty
To Your Boss, Betty,

51
00:02:32,563 --> 00:02:35,519
But Daniel Doesn't Work
At "Mode" Anymore.

52
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,115
Okay.

53
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:41,218
Well, Thanks For Your Time.

54
00:02:50,185 --> 00:02:51,585
What's Wrong?

55
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:54,952
Nothing. What's More Romantic
Than Lunch On Foot

56
00:02:54,986 --> 00:02:57,130
With A View
Of Rikers Island?

57
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:00,946
(Mouth Full) Okay.

58
00:03:01,752 --> 00:03:03,685
You Know,

59
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:07,066
You Deserve Better
Than Week-Old Lamb.

60
00:03:07,785 --> 00:03:09,446
How About...

61
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:11,819
A Real Date?

62
00:03:12,495 --> 00:03:13,619
(Gasps) Really?

63
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:17,187
Yeah, Jill Got Called
For A Layover Flight
Leaving Wednesday Morning.

64
00:03:17,187 --> 00:03:19,028
I'm Thinking
Maybe Wednesday Night,

65
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:21,678
 <I>We</I> Could Do Something Special.

66
00:03:25,685 --> 00:03:28,218
Hey. What--What Happened
To The Smile?

67
00:03:28,428 --> 00:03:29,552
No, Nothing.

68
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:32,552
I Just Try To Forget
That You Have A Wife,

69
00:03:32,585 --> 00:03:35,619
But... You Have A Wife.

70
00:03:35,652 --> 00:03:37,619
And I Told You
How Things Stand.

71
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:40,519
Coach, Everything
That You Said To Me

72
00:03:40,552 --> 00:03:44,151
About--About Us Having
A Future Together--

73
00:03:44,185 --> 00:03:46,452
Just Be Honest With Me,

74
00:03:46,485 --> 00:03:48,301
Is That For Real?

75
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,418
I Promise.

76
00:03:50,452 --> 00:03:52,585
You're Not The Other Woman.

77
00:03:52,619 --> 00:03:54,552
You're The Only Woman.

78
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:58,639
But If You Take This Shot
And Put It Right Here,

79
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,134
It Draws Your Eye
Right To The Ad.
Alexis, We Go To Print Tonight.

80
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:04,118
My Launch Party's
In Two Days.

81
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:06,652
There's Time.
And What About This Cover?

82
00:04:06,685 --> 00:04:09,085
Angelina Jolie
In A Block Of Ice?

83
00:04:09,118 --> 00:04:12,318
I Mean, Do You Have A Shot
That's A Little Le Arty?

84
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,621
Or At Least One
Where You Can See Who It Is?

85
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:18,552
Wait A Minute.
Those Aren't Your Notes. Ugh.

86
00:04:18,585 --> 00:04:23,252
Ah, The Rounded O's
Of A Stunted Adolescent,

87
00:04:23,285 --> 00:04:26,819
The Stiff T's Of Someone
Who's Clearly Overcompensating.

88
00:04:26,852 --> 00:04:28,886
This Is Daniel's Handwriting.

89
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:33,151
J'accuse.
Yes, These Are Daniel's Notes,
And I Happen To Agree With Them.

90
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:37,519
Why Is He Even Giving You Notes?
He Isn't. Betty Found Them
And Brought Them To Me.

91
00:04:37,552 --> 00:04:39,886
Now Why Don't You Put
Your Ego Aside For A Second

92
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,619
And Just Admit
That Your Issue Needs Help?

93
00:04:42,652 --> 00:04:44,585
I Mean, Where's Our "'Mode' Girl
On Madison" Feature?

94
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:47,085
Who Cares What The Average Woman
Wears On The Street?

95
00:04:47,118 --> 00:04:48,671
We Shouldn't
Be Taking Their Pictures.

96
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:51,847
We Should Be Throwing Rocks
At Them.
I Think Our Readers Like It.

97
00:04:51,847 --> 00:04:53,837
Our Readers Like
What I Tell Them To Like.

98
00:04:53,837 --> 00:04:56,336
Look, We Agreed That "Mode"
Needed A Kick In The Ass.

99
00:04:56,336 --> 00:05:00,024
I'm Giving It
A Kick In The Ass.
I Never Tire
Of You Saying That.

100
00:05:00,773 --> 00:05:02,761
Just Take A Look
At Daniel's Notes.

101
00:05:03,365 --> 00:05:04,712
Of Course.

102
00:05:05,677 --> 00:05:07,004
Well, She--

103
00:05:07,982 --> 00:05:10,373
I See Someone's
Gonna Be A Problem.
Daniel?

104
00:05:10,373 --> 00:05:12,817
(Scoffs) Daniel Is
An Overripe Cantaloupe

105
00:05:12,817 --> 00:05:14,172
Tumbling Toward Irrelevance.

106
00:05:14,172 --> 00:05:16,021
I'm Talking About Betty.

107
00:05:16,292 --> 00:05:19,125
She's Trying To Get Daniel Back
In Here. <I>She's</I> The Problem.

108
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,394
Okay, Lunch.

109
00:05:27,306 --> 00:05:29,014
No Burrito For You.

110
00:05:29,014 --> 00:05:31,209
Marc, Why Did You Do That?

111
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:33,408
You Have A Lunch Date.
With You?

112
00:05:33,408 --> 00:05:35,309
No. With Wilhelmina.

113
00:05:37,188 --> 00:05:38,642
(Woman) Mademoiselle.

114
00:05:38,676 --> 00:05:41,242
Look At Us--
Two Women Of Color

115
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:44,509
Out For A Fancy Lunch
On The Town. (Chuckles)

116
00:05:44,942 --> 00:05:48,075
Isn't This Fun, Girlfriend?

117
00:05:48,228 --> 00:05:50,542
(Chuckles) I Guess.

118
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:54,041
And That Blouse Is Heaven.

119
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,044
Where Did You Get It?
I Love It.

120
00:05:56,044 --> 00:05:57,509
Okay. No, You Don't.

121
00:05:57,542 --> 00:05:59,008
No, I Don't.

122
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:01,743
It's Hideous,
Like Driving Through Ohio.

123
00:06:01,776 --> 00:06:05,309
Look, Let's Cut To The Chase,
Betty. I Need You.

124
00:06:05,342 --> 00:06:06,609
What?

125
00:06:06,642 --> 00:06:08,109
You Kept Daniel's Files.

126
00:06:08,142 --> 00:06:10,542
Marc Can't Make
Heads Or Tails Of Them.

127
00:06:11,322 --> 00:06:13,918
Um, Okay. Yeah. Fine.

128
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,054
I'll Ask Daniel
For A Little Bit Of Time
To Come And Work On Them.

129
00:06:17,054 --> 00:06:21,337
Or You Could Recognize
A Career Opportunity
When You See One.

130
00:06:22,022 --> 00:06:26,220
Betty, You Were The Assistant
To The Editor-In-Chief
At "Mode" Before.

131
00:06:26,422 --> 00:06:29,642
I Think It's Time You Return
To Where You Belong.

132
00:06:29,676 --> 00:06:32,142
Are You Offering Me A Job?

133
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:35,382
At "Mode," Working For Me.

134
00:06:36,975 --> 00:06:40,072
Look, Wilhelmina,
I'm Not Leaving Daniel,

135
00:06:40,072 --> 00:06:43,452
And... To Be Frank...

136
00:06:43,743 --> 00:06:45,898
I Don't Really Trust You.

137
00:06:46,425 --> 00:06:49,409
Loyalty <I>And</I> Suspicion--

138
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,811
Two Very Admirable Qualities.

139
00:06:52,975 --> 00:06:55,489
Betty, You Belong At "Mode,"

140
00:06:55,489 --> 00:06:57,719
And I Think Daniel
Would Understand.

141
00:06:57,719 --> 00:07:00,860
Well, I Think Daniel Will Say
That You Want To Hire Me

142
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,242
To Ask Me To Do
Very Bad, Bad Things.

143
00:07:03,275 --> 00:07:06,997
(Scoffs)
I Would Never Ask You To Do Anything Wrong,

144
00:07:06,997 --> 00:07:09,098
Ugly Or Morally Suspect.

145
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:11,113
That's What I Have Marc For,
Dear.

146
00:07:11,332 --> 00:07:13,051
W--
Don't Answer Now.

147
00:07:13,356 --> 00:07:16,155
But Don't Throw Your Future Away
At "Player."

148
00:07:21,606 --> 00:07:23,371
She Offered You A Raise, Too?

149
00:07:23,371 --> 00:07:24,623
A Little One, Yeah.

150
00:07:24,656 --> 00:07:27,090
Well, Every Bit Helps
When You Have A New Apartment.

151
00:07:27,122 --> 00:07:30,289
Dad, I Am Not Going To Sell Out
Daniel To Pay My Rent.

152
00:07:30,322 --> 00:07:33,873
You're Not Selling Anyone Out
When You're Making
A Good Career Move.

153
00:07:33,873 --> 00:07:36,122
Aunt Betty, You Have
To Go Back To "Mode."

154
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,828
"Player" Gets Me Nothing.

155
00:07:38,054 --> 00:07:39,780
It's Like I'm Stuck
In A Sand Trap

156
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,531
At The Bottom
Of The Ninth Quarter.

157
00:07:43,623 --> 00:07:45,656
Listen To Me.
I'm Already Changing.

158
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:47,985
Oh, That Reminds Me.
Tony Wanted To Know

159
00:07:47,985 --> 00:07:50,338
If He Could Have One Of Those
Signed "Player" Covers

160
00:07:50,338 --> 00:07:52,689
With All The Star Athletes
For The School Auction.

161
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:54,976
Oh, Sure. Yeah, Hilda.
I'll Just Ask Daniel

162
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:58,721
Right After I Tell Him
That His Mortal Enemy
Offered Me A Better Job
With More Pay.

163
00:07:58,756 --> 00:08:00,474
Opportunities
Are Coming Your Way.

164
00:08:00,474 --> 00:08:03,990
This Is Something
To Be Proud Of.
I Don't Think That's How
Daniel's Gonna See It, Dad.

165
00:08:04,023 --> 00:08:07,589
I Feel Like I Was Cheating
St <I>Talking</I> To Wilhelmina.
You're Not Cheating.

166
00:08:07,623 --> 00:08:09,556
It's Not Cheating
To Explore Other Options

167
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,568
Because Your Situation
Is At A Dead End.

168
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,114
I Just--I Care About You.
That's All.

169
00:08:17,342 --> 00:08:18,779
Well, One Thing Is For Sure.

170
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:20,453
I Have To Go In There
First Thing In The Morning

171
00:08:20,453 --> 00:08:22,022
And Tell Daniel
That I Spoke To Wilhelmina,

172
00:08:22,022 --> 00:08:24,552
Because Secrets In That Place
Have A Way Of Going Bad.

173
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:32,314
Someone's Working Late.

174
00:08:32,677 --> 00:08:34,908
Yeah. I Just Came By
To Pick Up A Little Homework.

175
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,750
Lucky I Ran Into You.

176
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,470
I Want To Make Sure You're
Coming To My Launch Party.

177
00:08:40,184 --> 00:08:43,218
(Scoffs)
Well, I Hadn't Really--
Wonderful. You Know,
I'm So Glad We're Talking.

178
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:46,137
I Know It Seems Like I'm Trying
To Poach Your Assistant.

179
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,774
(Laughs) Excuse Me?

180
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:49,463
Oh,
Betty Did Tell You We Spoke

181
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:51,438
About Her Coming To Work For Me,
Didn't She?

182
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:54,077
I Mean, I Know You Two
Have No Secrets.

183
00:08:58,624 --> 00:09:00,692
Mm. Good. It's All
Out In The Open Then.

184
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,218
Of Course
It's Out In The Open.

185
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:05,438
I Mean, Everything's
Out In The Open
Between Me And Betty.
(Ding)

186
00:09:06,448 --> 00:09:09,237
How Could You Hide This
From Me?
I'm Sorry. I'm Sorry.

187
00:09:09,237 --> 00:09:12,271
God, Just The Thought Of It,
You Sitting At Her Desk,

188
00:09:12,304 --> 00:09:14,371
Rolling Calls For Her?!

189
00:09:14,404 --> 00:09:16,738
Daniel,
I Don't Want To Leave You.

190
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:19,069
Then Why Are You
Going Behind My Back?
It Wasn't Like That.

191
00:09:19,069 --> 00:09:20,995
Okay, Well, Tell Me
What Happened, Please.

192
00:09:21,155 --> 00:09:25,276
You Met With Her, She Offered
You A Job And You Didn't Say No.

193
00:09:25,276 --> 00:09:26,841
Daniel,
Working At "Player" Magazine

194
00:09:26,841 --> 00:09:28,952
Isn't Exactly My Dream Job.

195
00:09:32,681 --> 00:09:34,092
I'm Not Happy Here.

196
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:36,576
I Am.

197
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:38,276
Are You?

198
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:40,709
Just Stop Right Now.

199
00:09:40,743 --> 00:09:43,908
I'm Not Leaving.
Do You Understand?

200
00:09:43,942 --> 00:09:46,046
This Is What I Want.

201
00:09:46,242 --> 00:09:48,908
Well, Maybe It's
Not What <I>I</I> Want.

202
00:09:48,942 --> 00:09:52,235
Look, You Want To Go Workfor Wilhelmina ???

203
00:09:52,878 --> 00:09:56,247
Daniel, Can We Please
Just Talk About This Reasonably?

204
00:09:56,247 --> 00:09:58,138
I Am Being Utterly Reasonable!

205
00:09:58,138 --> 00:10:00,793
If You Hate It Here, If You
Think You'd Be So Much Happier

206
00:10:00,793 --> 00:10:03,703
Working For Wilhelmina, Go.
Is That
What You Want Me To Do?

207
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,204
Is That What You Want To Do?

208
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,154
Wilhelmina?

209
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:13,770
Does The Offer Still Stand?

210

213
00:10:30,989 --> 00:10:33,732
Daniel's Like A Different Person
Since He's Been At "Player."

214
00:10:34,202 --> 00:10:36,857
All Of The Fight And Ambition
Is Out Of Him.

215
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:39,606
You Can't
Make People Change, Betty.

216
00:10:39,607 --> 00:10:41,640
At Some Point, You've Got
To Look Out For Yourself.

217
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:43,340
I Know. You're Right.

218
00:10:43,373 --> 00:10:45,306
But I'm Working
For Wilhelmina.

219
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,540
I Know, The Wicked Witch
Of The East Side.

220
00:10:47,573 --> 00:10:49,540
But You're A Smart Girl.

221
00:10:49,573 --> 00:10:52,506
I Am, And I Know Exactly
What She's Capable Of,

222
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,414
So I'll Just Keep My Eyes Open
At All Times.

223
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,716
Truth Be Told...

224
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,669
I'm Glad You're Back.

225
00:11:02,074 --> 00:11:04,707
Christina Must Have
A Doughnut In Her Pocket.

226
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,239
Betty Suarez Under My Rule.

227
00:11:07,273 --> 00:11:10,239
How I Have Longed
For This Day.

228
00:11:10,273 --> 00:11:12,673
Marc, We Don't Want Her
To Quit.

229
00:11:12,707 --> 00:11:15,306
We Just Want Her To Stay Away
From Daniel For A While.

230
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,604
Just Keep Her Busy.

231
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:20,040
Betty Suarez!

232
00:11:20,074 --> 00:11:22,962
Our Newest Employee.

233
00:11:23,727 --> 00:11:24,607
Marc.

234
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,273
Complimentary Mimosa?
Really?

235
00:11:27,306 --> 00:11:30,074
No, But If You
Get The Filing Right...

236
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,840
(Singsong Voice) I Won't
Beat You With A Bag Of Oranges.

237
00:11:33,873 --> 00:11:35,340
You Be Nice To Her.

238
00:11:35,373 --> 00:11:38,273
Don't Eat Or Drink Anything
That He Gives You, Okay?

239
00:11:38,306 --> 00:11:40,440
Oh, Don't Be Silly.

240
00:11:40,473 --> 00:11:42,805
Betty's On Team Slater Now.

241
00:11:42,805 --> 00:11:45,040
Ere Will Be
No Drugging Of You.

242
00:11:45,074 --> 00:11:47,974
Okay, Seriously, You Can't
Touch My Nose Anymore.

243
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,373
I-I Don't Understand.
What--A Holdup?

244
00:11:52,406 --> 00:11:54,673
I Thought His Immigration Papers
Were Going Through This Week.

245
00:11:54,707 --> 00:11:56,139
I'm Sorry, Mr. Meade.

246
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,632
Your Son's Grandparents
In France
Filed A Claim For Custody.

247
00:11:59,698 --> 00:12:02,867
Oh, No, No, No. I--Look,
I Talked To Them Already.

248
00:12:02,867 --> 00:12:04,632
They Agreed To The--
Well, I Guess
They Changed Their Minds.

249
00:12:04,665 --> 00:12:08,110
They Want Him Home.
Well, He Is Home.
I'm His Father.

250
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,143
Look, Yo-You Have To Do
Something About This.

251
00:12:10,143 --> 00:12:11,897
The State Department
Has To Be Able To Do--

252
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,843
Your Family Connections
At The State
Can Help Expedite Immigration,

253
00:12:14,876 --> 00:12:16,710
But They Filed The Claim
In Court.

254
00:12:16,743 --> 00:12:18,975
This Could Turn
Into A Real Custody Battle.

255
00:12:18,975 --> 00:12:20,471
Daniel Jr. Lost His Mother.

256
00:12:20,471 --> 00:12:22,667
He's Not Gonna Lose
His Father, Too.

257
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,209
These Things Can Get Ugly.

258
00:12:25,242 --> 00:12:28,010
(Scoffs)
Your Son Is 13 Years Old.

259
00:12:28,043 --> 00:12:30,264
Maybe Before You Get Involved
In A Big Legal Battle

260
00:12:30,264 --> 00:12:32,384
You Should Ask Him
What He Wants To Do.

261
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,342
(Marc) Don't Interrupt,

262
00:13:00,376 --> 00:13:01,676
Be Invisible,

263
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,036
And If Penelope Del Rios Asks,

264
00:13:03,036 --> 00:13:05,643
You're A Huge Fan
Of Her Cosmetics.

265
00:13:05,676 --> 00:13:08,609
You Can't Live Without 'Em.
I Don't Wear
Del Rios Cosmetics.

266
00:13:08,643 --> 00:13:09,783
Hold On. (Clears Throat)

267
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,726
Yes, You Do.

268
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,816
Take A Look, Penelope.

269
00:13:14,849 --> 00:13:17,316
I Think You'll Agree
The New "Mode" Is More Upscale,

270
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:20,009
More Chic--
Exactly Your Demographic.

271
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:22,949
You'll Kick Yourself If You
Don't Take Another Two Pages.

272
00:13:22,983 --> 00:13:25,900
Yes, But We've Been Advertising
In "Mode" For Two Years Now,

273
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,295
And There's Been No Uptick
In Our Sales.

274
00:13:28,295 --> 00:13:31,650
I See No Reason
To Spend More Ney.
Excuse Me. I'm Sorry.

275
00:13:31,683 --> 00:13:34,423
Oh, No. That's For Wilhe--

276
00:13:36,601 --> 00:13:37,250
Enjoy.

277
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,149
Aah!
Thank You, Betty.

278
00:13:39,183 --> 00:13:41,216
 <I>Gracias.</I> Not So Fast.

279
00:13:42,462 --> 00:13:44,480
Tell Me... (Chuckles) Betty,

280
00:13:45,099 --> 00:13:47,816
Do You Use My Cosmetics?

281
00:13:50,283 --> 00:13:52,526
It's Right On Your...

282
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:56,068
No.

283
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,550
I'm S--I-I Can't Afford Them.
Sorry.

284
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:04,076
I Do. I'd Rather Starve Than
Go Without Your Night Creme.

285
00:14:05,853 --> 00:14:08,566
We Are Coming Out
With A Budget Line, You Know?

286
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,163
Really?

287
00:14:10,404 --> 00:14:12,422
Well, You Should
Advertise That In "Mode."

288
00:14:13,773 --> 00:14:16,746
(Scoffs) I Very Much Doubt
The Del Rios Budget Customers

289
00:14:16,746 --> 00:14:19,147
Are Poring Through
The High-End Pages Of "Mode."

290
00:14:19,147 --> 00:14:20,512
Oh, They Totally Do.

291
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,646
My Sister--
She Has A Salon In Queens,

292
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,203
And All Those Women Love "Mode."
They--It's All They Talk About.

293
00:14:25,203 --> 00:14:27,101
All Day Long, Rah. "Mode."

294
00:14:27,101 --> 00:14:29,010
They Just Can't Afford
Anything In It.

295
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,810
Isn't That Interesting?

296
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,313
I Think We Just Found A Way
To Sell Your New Line.

297
00:14:35,148 --> 00:14:37,746
This Is Good.
I Came In Saying No.

298
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,286
I Leave Saying... Yes.

299
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:47,136
Can You Believe It?

300
00:14:47,168 --> 00:14:49,136
My First Day Here,
And I Helped Sell.

301
00:14:49,168 --> 00:14:51,218
Did You Flip Your Wig?
I Told You To Be Invisible.

302
00:14:51,218 --> 00:14:55,673
She Asked Me A Question,
And I Was Helpful.
Don't You Get It?
Wilhelmina Doesn't Need Help.

303
00:14:55,935 --> 00:14:59,435
You Never Outshine The Queen.
Yeah, Well,
She Landed A Major Advertiser,

304
00:14:59,468 --> 00:15:01,935
And By The Way,
Wilhelmina Totally Smiled At Me.

305
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:04,568
She Wasn't Smiling.
She Was Showing Her Teeth.

306
00:15:04,602 --> 00:15:05,763
Betty!

307
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:08,002
In My Office Now.

308
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:19,716
Wilhelmina...

309
00:15:21,376 --> 00:15:26,173
I Just Want To Apologize
If I Spoke Out Of Tu
In Your Meeting--

310
00:15:27,181 --> 00:15:29,207
I Need Some Things
For The Launch Party.

311
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:30,838
Run To Dior.

312
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,996
Luke Created
A Signature Perfume For Me.

313
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,463
Bee Pollen--
Make Sure It's African.

314
00:15:35,496 --> 00:15:38,025
I Need Some Cleansing Milk
From Diane Bouch?

315
00:15:38,025 --> 00:15:40,496
I Also Need The Tiara
That Catherine The Great Wore

316
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:42,496
At Her Wedding
To Peter Iii.

317
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:46,254
It's Part
Of The Permanent Collection
Of The Museum
Of Russian Antiquities.

318
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,067
I Want To Wear It
To My Party.
But Do They Even--

319
00:15:50,857 --> 00:15:52,363
Could You Give Me A Hint? I--

320
00:15:53,615 --> 00:15:55,229
Seriously, Wilhelmina,
How Am I--

321
00:15:55,262 --> 00:15:58,197
Shh.
By The End Of The Day.

322
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,199
Come On. Right Here.
Come On.

323
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:09,620
Yeah! All Right!
It's Coming. Oh, No!

324
00:16:11,863 --> 00:16:13,796
God, You're Gettin' Good
At This, Aren't You?

325
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,896
Are You Having Fun?
 <I>Oui.</I> Good Time.

326
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,995
Well, I Figured Since You
Had To Start School Tomorrow,

327
00:16:17,995 --> 00:16:20,035
We Might Get In
One More Day Of Hooky.

328
00:16:20,607 --> 00:16:23,517
Uh, Hooky?
Like, Uh, Prostitute?

329
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:25,979
No, No. No Prostitutes.

330
00:16:25,979 --> 00:16:27,379
Only When You're Older.

331
00:16:27,412 --> 00:16:31,479
I Mean... (Clears Throat)
Not At All, Son.

332
00:16:31,512 --> 00:16:33,446
No, I Just Thought
We'd Talk,

333
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:36,600
You Know,
About Important Stuff.

334
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,779
So... (Clears Throat)

335
00:16:38,813 --> 00:16:41,650
You, Uh,
You Have Grandparents...

336
00:16:41,807 --> 00:16:43,547
Back In France.

337
00:16:43,979 --> 00:16:45,611
Do You--Do You Miss Them?

338
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,312
 <I>Oui.</I>

339
00:16:47,345 --> 00:16:49,679
I Love Them Very Much.

340
00:16:50,848 --> 00:16:52,345
Maybe, Uh,

341
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,046
We Can Visit?

342
00:16:54,885 --> 00:16:56,680
Yeah. Yep.

343
00:16:56,979 --> 00:16:58,512
Sure.

344
00:17:03,151 --> 00:17:06,605
You, Uh, Don't Want
To Talk More?

345
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,046
Nah. You Know What?

346
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,146
I Think
That's Enough Talking.

347
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,540
Come On.

348
00:17:16,345 --> 00:17:17,813
I Don't Get It.

349
00:17:17,846 --> 00:17:20,279
I Totally Helped Her
On That Del Rios Account,

350
00:17:20,312 --> 00:17:23,279
And Now It's Like She's Trying
To Torture Me With A Tiara?

351
00:17:23,312 --> 00:17:25,379
It's Like
She Wants Me To Quit.

352
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:26,624
What's The Worst
She Could Do?

353
00:17:26,624 --> 00:17:29,302
Well, They Say She Once Beat
An Assistant With A Car Antenna,

354
00:17:29,302 --> 00:17:31,016
But I Think It's Just A Myth.(Cell Phone Rings)

355
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:34,819
Oh, God, No. Stuart.

356
00:17:35,311 --> 00:17:38,913
What? What's Wrong?
I Think
He's Doing Drugs Again.

357
00:17:38,946 --> 00:17:41,679
What?
Oh, My God, Christina...

358
00:17:41,713 --> 00:17:43,899
I Took This From His Stuff.

359
00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:46,202
Ew! Ew! Ew! It's Gross!
Put It Away.

360
00:17:46,723 --> 00:17:49,524
That's Disgusting, But I Don't
Think It Means He's Doing Drugs.

361
00:17:49,524 --> 00:17:51,107
I Know, But It Can Tell Me
If He Is.

362
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:53,745
I've Sent Some Hair Samples
To A Lab.

363
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:57,188
Well,
What Can I Do To Help You?
I Need You At "Mode," Betty.

364
00:17:57,188 --> 00:17:59,003
You're The Only Ally
I've Got There.

365
00:17:59,003 --> 00:18:01,797
So Please,
Just--Just Don't Get Fired.

366
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:05,724
Well, I Can Try.

367
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:21,978
Miss, I Need You
To Stand Back, Pleas

368
00:18:21,979 --> 00:18:22,979
Miss!

369
00:18:24,352 --> 00:18:27,152
I'm Sorry. Um, Actually,
I Was Wondering,

370
00:18:27,185 --> 00:18:30,085
Who Do I Talk To About
Renting This Tiara?

371
00:18:34,971 --> 00:18:36,682
I Mean,
You Don't Have To Laugh.

372
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:39,318
I Can't Be The First Person
To Ask That Question.

373
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,959
Is There Somebody Else
I Can Talk To?

374
00:18:49,607 --> 00:18:51,414
I Know It's A Crazy Request,

375
00:18:51,414 --> 00:18:54,813
But She Really,
Really Wants It.

376
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:56,780
You Know What? Never Mind,

377
00:18:56,813 --> 00:19:00,014
You're Probably Just Gonna Laugh
At Me, Too, Right? Okay.

378
00:19:03,147 --> 00:19:05,347
I'm Guessing That's A No?

379
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,548
(Snaps)
This Is My Favorite Part
Of The Job--

380
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:10,514
Injecting Deadly Poison
Into My Boss' Head.

381
00:19:10,548 --> 00:19:13,696
Mm. Well, It Helps That You Have
Really Feminine Fingers.
Mm. It's A Blessing.

382
00:19:13,696 --> 00:19:15,684
No Luck
With Catherine The Great,

383
00:19:15,684 --> 00:19:18,946
Betty The Mediocre?
You've Been Gone
A Long Time.

384
00:19:18,946 --> 00:19:21,772
I Know. I'm Sorry.
I Ran Into A Few Troubles.

385
00:19:21,772 --> 00:19:24,285
I Had To Go To Three Different
Stores To Get Your Bee Pollen,

386
00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:27,281
But I Got It, And Your
Cleansing Milk Cost Over $600,

387
00:19:27,281 --> 00:19:30,682
So I Had To Call Accounting
First For Authorization.
Where's The Tiara?

388
00:19:31,223 --> 00:19:32,517
I Don't Have It...

389
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:34,576
But They Do.

390
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,727
It Turns Out The Curator's
Boyfriend Dumped Her

391
00:19:43,727 --> 00:19:46,611
Just Because She Gained
A Little Bit Of Weight
Due To An Underactive Thyroid.

392
00:19:46,611 --> 00:19:47,782
I Know. It's So Sad.

393
00:19:47,782 --> 00:19:49,366
So I Just Sat With Her
For, Like, An Hour,

394
00:19:49,366 --> 00:19:51,834
And I Think
That's All She Needed
Was Someone To Talk To,

395
00:19:51,867 --> 00:19:56,041
You Know, To Listen.
Are We To Understand
That You Got The Tiara
By Being Nice To Someone?

396
00:19:56,589 --> 00:19:58,864
Well, No, Not Exactly.

397
00:19:59,582 --> 00:20:02,524
We Also Have To Give The Museum
A Full-Page Ad
In Next Month's Issue,

398
00:20:02,524 --> 00:20:04,073
But I Already Talked
To Ad Sales,

399
00:20:04,073 --> 00:20:05,622
And We Worked Out
A Barter Agreement.

400
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:08,313
We Give Them Ad Space, They Give
You The Tiara For 48 Hours,

401
00:20:08,313 --> 00:20:12,149
And Also Ed And Andy
Have To Be Within 20 Feet
Of The Tiara At All Times.

402
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:14,113
If You Ask Me, It's
Just Beginner's Luck. I Mean--

403
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,146
Marc, Take Off Your Gloves.

404
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,470
Betty Will Be Doing
My Botox Today.

405
00:20:25,061 --> 00:20:29,025
Um, Don't You Think
A Doctor Should Do This

406
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:31,991
Or At Least
A Nurse Practitioner?

407
00:20:31,991 --> 00:20:35,124
Oh, I'm So Numb Up There
I Wouldn't Know If You Hit Bone.

408
00:20:39,991 --> 00:20:43,158
Betty, Do You Know
Why I Hired You?

409
00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:45,091
To Help With Your Files?

410
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:50,820
I Always Suspected
You Were The Brains
Behind Daniel Meade.

411
00:20:52,091 --> 00:20:54,024
Uh, Well, No.
No, Th-That's Just--

412
00:20:54,057 --> 00:20:56,587
That's Not True.Daniel Is Very Smart.

413
00:20:56,587 --> 00:20:58,269
Yes, Yes, Yes.
Smart As A Whip.

414
00:20:58,269 --> 00:21:01,063
But Let's Talk About You
For A Moment.

415
00:21:01,063 --> 00:21:06,553
Betty, You Passed The Test.

416
00:21:09,422 --> 00:21:13,621
So The Tiara Thing--
That Was A Test?

417
00:21:13,654 --> 00:21:16,306
Because I Thought That
It Was Some Sort Of Punishment

418
00:21:16,306 --> 00:21:18,386
For Speaking Up
In Your Meeting.

419
00:21:18,765 --> 00:21:20,128
On The Contrary.

420
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:23,388
I Was Very, Very Impressed.

421
00:21:23,422 --> 00:21:26,455
And It Made Me Think
That Maybe...

422
00:21:26,489 --> 00:21:28,575
You Were...

423
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:30,721
The One.

424
00:21:31,488 --> 00:21:33,921
Like "Lord Of The Rings"?

425
00:21:33,955 --> 00:21:35,888
Betty, There's Only Been
One Other Rson

426
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:38,599
Who's Been Able To Get
That Tiara--Me.

427
00:21:38,788 --> 00:21:40,677
When I Was Fey Sommers'
Assistant,

428
00:21:40,677 --> 00:21:44,080
She Wanted That Tiara For <I>Her</I>
Launch Party Ofherfirst Issue,

429
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,797
And I Did It.

430
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:49,708
Of Course My Methods Were
A Little Less Wholesome
Than Yours.

431
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,906
But I Proved To Her That Given
A Seemingly Impossible Task,

432
00:21:53,906 --> 00:21:55,738
I Could Accomplish It.

433
00:21:56,426 --> 00:21:57,463
So?

434
00:21:57,641 --> 00:22:02,868
Betty, You've Proved
That You Have Rare Potential
That Must Be Cultivated.

435
00:22:02,868 --> 00:22:05,656
I‘m ????

436
00:22:05,656 --> 00:22:07,547
And Lord Knows,
You Need Some Grooming.

437
00:22:07,547 --> 00:22:09,413
You Will Be My ??,

438
00:22:09,446 --> 00:22:12,090
And You Will Start With
Taking Over My Launch Party.

439
00:22:13,246 --> 00:22:14,980
But That's Marc's Job.

440
00:22:15,013 --> 00:22:16,562
And Now It's Yours.

441
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,016
Betty,
I'm Offering You A Future.

442
00:22:19,551 --> 00:22:20,741
After Being My Assistant,

443
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:22,766
You Could Write Your Own Ticket
In This Town.

444
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:27,125
And Who Knows? Maybe You'll Be
The Next Wilhelmina Slater.

445
00:22:34,226 --> 00:22:35,746
Marc?

446
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,383
Look, I'm Hoping--

447
00:22:39,433 --> 00:22:40,539
I Would Rather Eat Butter.

448
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,834
I Haven'even Asked You
To Do Anything Yet.

449
00:22:42,926 --> 00:22:45,725
You Bossing Me Around Is
A Crime Against Nature.

450
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:47,325
Marc, You're Being Ridiculous.

451
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:48,921
Sorcers!

452
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:52,759
You've Taken Away From Me
Everything That Matters.

453
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:54,931
Marc, Look--

454
00:22:55,926 --> 00:22:58,548
I Didn't Try And Take
Your Job From You,

455
00:22:58,548 --> 00:23:01,559
And I'm So Sorry About This,

456
00:23:01,986 --> 00:23:04,436
But I Have To Try
And Make A Launch Party Happen

457
00:23:04,436 --> 00:23:07,959
In Less Than 27 Hours,
And There Is <I>No Way</I>

458
00:23:07,992 --> 00:23:10,826
That I Could Do It
Without You.

459
00:23:11,601 --> 00:23:12,659
No.

460
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:15,159
So If You Could,
Please, Please, Please...

461
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,877
Try And Help Me Find
A Life-Sized,

462
00:23:17,877 --> 00:23:21,080
Anatomically Correct
Black Vodka Ice Sculpture
Of You Know Who...

463
00:23:21,992 --> 00:23:24,159
God! And Then She Just
Waddles Back In Here

464
00:23:24,193 --> 00:23:26,126
Like A Helpless Brown Weeble,

465
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,092
And While I'm Not Looking,
Plunges My World Into Darkness.

466
00:23:29,126 --> 00:23:31,892
Oh. Poor Baby. Come Here.

467
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:40,226
You're Nice,
But Don't Touch The Hair.

468
00:23:40,268 --> 00:23:42,193
It's Just How I Like It.
Okay.

469
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:44,591
Hi. I'm Looking
For Betty Suarez.

470
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:49,476
Hi. I'm Betty Suarez.

471
00:23:49,526 --> 00:23:51,383
Don't Be Absurd.

472
00:23:51,492 --> 00:23:53,449
I'm Betty Suarez.
How Can I Help You?

473
00:23:53,449 --> 00:23:56,350
Yeah, Uh, Can You Guys Just
Page Her For Me? Is That--
Oh.

474
00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:00,417
Tony! Tony. Hi. Uh...
Oh, Hey.

475
00:24:00,417 --> 00:24:01,709
Sorry About Them.

476
00:24:01,709 --> 00:24:02,784
No, No. It's, Uh, Okay.

477
00:24:02,784 --> 00:24:04,806
Is This A Good Time
To Get That Signed Copy?

478
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:08,536
Um, Right. I'll Go Down
To "Player" And Get It.

479
00:24:08,536 --> 00:24:12,391
You Wait Here, Just Maybe
Not So Close To Them.

480
00:24:20,733 --> 00:24:22,166
Here You Go.

481
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:23,306
Oh, Very Cool.

482
00:24:25,783 --> 00:24:26,991
You See That Super Bowl?

483
00:24:26,991 --> 00:24:28,928
If I Say Yes, Will You
Take Your Shirt Off?

484
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,627
Okay,
And Thanks For Coming, Tony.

485
00:24:31,627 --> 00:24:35,120
Will You Tell Hilda
That I'll Call Her Later Today?
Yeah. Thanks.

486
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,650
Bye. Whoa!

487
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:40,377
I Need Mr.-Sugar-Pants-
Bedroom-Eyes' Number.

488
00:24:40,377 --> 00:24:43,237
Tony? No. I'm Nogiving You
His Phone Number.

489
00:24:43,237 --> 00:24:45,122
I Need To See Him Again
To Give Him His Phone,

490
00:24:45,122 --> 00:24:46,251
Which He Accidentally
Left Here

491
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,013
When It Fell Out Of His Pocket
Into My Hand.

492
00:24:48,013 --> 00:24:50,733
Wait A Second.
You Pickpocketed Coach Diaz?

493
00:24:50,733 --> 00:24:53,963
I Was In A Trance. I Barely
Remember What Happened.

494
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:58,115
Ooh, But These Pictures Of Him
Kissing That Slutty Stewardess
Are Really Dulling My Tingle.

495
00:24:58,115 --> 00:25:00,177
My Sister
Is Not A Stewardess.

496
00:25:11,807 --> 00:25:15,275
But It Has To Be Delivered
At 8:00 P.M. Sharp
Because It's An Ice Sculpture,

497
00:25:15,275 --> 00:25:17,241
And I Don't Want It To Melt.
Don't Mind Me.

498
00:25:17,274 --> 00:25:19,707
I Took A Train For A Half-Hour
From Queens

499
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,174
To Eat Soggy Dumplings By Myself
And Watch You Talk.

500
00:25:22,207 --> 00:25:24,640
Okay, I'll Call You Back
In The Morning. Thank You.

501
00:25:24,673 --> 00:25:27,174
Hilda! I'm Sorry. I Have
This Launch Party Tomorrow.

502
00:25:27,207 --> 00:25:28,840
It's Driving Me Crazy.

503
00:25:28,874 --> 00:25:32,907
Okay, So I Heard Tony
Was Sexually Harassed
By Your Coworkers.

504
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:34,910
Yeah, That Happens A Lot
In That Place.

505
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,612
(Laughs) Oh, Before I Foet,
You Have His Cell Phone?

506
00:25:38,533 --> 00:25:39,574
Right. Okay.

507
00:25:39,608 --> 00:25:43,040
Uh, So, Hilda, This Is What
I Wanted To Talk To You About.

508
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,640
Oh, God. This Is--
This Is Hard.

509
00:25:49,307 --> 00:25:53,254
So I Saw Some Photos
On Tony's Phone...

510
00:25:54,007 --> 00:25:56,581
Of Him And Another Woman.

511
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:04,107
Are You Okay?

512
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,190
I'm So Sorry, Hilda.
Say Something.

513
00:26:11,508 --> 00:26:13,241
That's His Wife.

514
00:26:13,274 --> 00:26:14,740
What?

515
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,508
Wait.
They're, Like, Separated?

516
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:21,120
Well, You Know,
It's Complicated.

517
00:26:22,141 --> 00:26:24,374
What,
You're Dating A Married Man?

518
00:26:24,407 --> 00:26:28,107
See? This Is Why I Don't Tell
You Things. Because You Judge.

519
00:26:28,141 --> 00:26:29,413
Yeah, Because, Hilda,
That Would Be Wrong.

520
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:32,826
Well, I Didn't Know That He Was
Married When We Started Dating,

521
00:26:32,826 --> 00:26:34,895
And Then--
Hilda, What Are You Thinking?

522
00:26:35,312 --> 00:26:38,242
You Have To Get Out Of This.
This Is Just Gonna End Bad.

523
00:26:38,242 --> 00:26:41,614
Well, Who Says It's Gonna End?
We're Gonna Make It Work.

524
00:26:41,614 --> 00:26:43,980
Look, Can't You
Just Be Happy For Me?

525
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:46,587
No. He Has A Wife.

526
00:26:46,587 --> 00:26:49,050
You Think I Don't Know That? You
Think That Doesn't Tear Me Up?

527
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,334
Well, Then Walk Away.

528
00:26:50,334 --> 00:26:51,583
I Can't. (Scoffs)

529
00:26:54,503 --> 00:26:55,719
I'm In Love With Him.

530
00:27:00,248 --> 00:27:02,304
I'm Not Hungry Anymore.

531
00:27:12,658 --> 00:27:13,658
Like I Said, Uh,

532
00:27:13,789 --> 00:27:15,923
Remember Not To Get Too Hung Up
On Any One Girl.

533
00:27:15,923 --> 00:27:18,366
You're--You're Young.
You Gotta Play The Field.
 <I>Quoi?</I>

534
00:27:18,856 --> 00:27:21,714
And Listen In Class, Okay?
That's What I Told You.

535
00:27:21,715 --> 00:27:25,276
Um, <I>??Outer Le</I> Teacher.

536
00:27:25,649 --> 00:27:25,990
 <I>Oui.</I>

537
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:30,114
Papa, Uh, Your French Is, Uh,

538
00:27:30,114 --> 00:27:32,014
How You Say--Sucky.

539
00:27:33,991 --> 00:27:36,686
Just Have A Good Day.

540
00:27:40,953 --> 00:27:43,689
 <I>Bonjour, Daniel.</I>

541
00:27:56,368 --> 00:27:58,234
You're A Natural Father.

542
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,873
Am I Being Selfish?

543
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,283
His Grandparents
Want Him Back In France.

544
00:28:03,316 --> 00:28:04,431
I Know He Misses Them.

545
00:28:04,431 --> 00:28:07,798
Well, He Can Miss Them
And Still Want To Be Here
With His Father.

546
00:28:08,374 --> 00:28:09,435
He's In A Foreign Country.

547
00:28:09,435 --> 00:28:12,317
He's Away From Everything
He Knows, Everyone.

548
00:28:12,908 --> 00:28:15,315
Don't You Think
He'd Be Happier With Them?

549
00:28:15,315 --> 00:28:17,574
Doesn't Really Matter
What I Think, Does It?

550
00:28:21,808 --> 00:28:23,242
I Know.

551
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,477
I Have To Ask Him.

552
00:28:25,492 --> 00:28:28,836
I'm Just Afraid I'm Not Gonna
Get The Answer I Want.

553
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:31,164
I Don't Want To Lose Him.

554
00:28:39,936 --> 00:28:41,833
(Man) Where Do You Want
This Ice Sculpture?

555
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:44,541
Oh, No, No, No.
This Can't Be Here Right Now.

556
00:28:44,574 --> 00:28:46,541
The Party Isn't Till Tonight.
She'll Melt.

557
00:28:46,574 --> 00:28:49,041
Emily. Can You Please
Take These Guys

558
00:28:49,075 --> 00:28:51,426
Down To The Italian Restaurant
And Beg Them To Let Us
Use Their Walk-In?

559
00:28:51,426 --> 00:28:53,062
I Don't Care If You Have To Buy
Every Pizza In The Place.

560
00:28:53,062 --> 00:28:55,464
Just Hurry. We Don't Want Her
To Start Sagging.

561
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:01,034
You Guys, Seriously,
Can You Stop Goofing Around?

562
00:29:01,034 --> 00:29:03,208
You Know How Wilhelmina Gets.
Yeah, How Does She Get?

563
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:04,592
Tell Us.
Yeah, Tell Us.

564
00:29:04,592 --> 00:29:07,567
Tell Us.
Little Miss Thing Here
Has Been Working For Wilhelmina
For Half A Minute,

565
00:29:07,567 --> 00:29:14,166
Now She's All Up In Her Gooch.
I Have Been Up All Night,
Working On This Party,

566
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:16,208
And There Are Still A Million
Things That We Have To Do.

567
00:29:16,242 --> 00:29:18,175
A Million And One, Actually.

568
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:22,275
Wilhelmina Wants You To Shred
All This Old Mail Into Confetti.
I'm Busy. Can You Do It?

569
00:29:22,308 --> 00:29:25,008
Uh, Let Me Think. Hmm.

570
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:26,101
No.

571
00:29:26,574 --> 00:29:28,507
Just Because You're Running
This Party

572
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:30,474
Doesn't Mean
You Can Boss Me Around.

573
00:29:30,507 --> 00:29:32,582
And You May Be In Wilhelmina's
Good Graces Today,

574
00:29:32,582 --> 00:29:35,024
But That Doesn't Mean Anything
About Tomorrow.

575
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:38,054
Loyalty Is Not One Of
Wilhelmina's Strong Suits.

576
00:29:38,054 --> 00:29:40,545
Oh, But, You Know, I Guess
It Isn't One Of Yours Either.

577
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:43,342
What? I Am Loyal.

578
00:29:43,374 --> 00:29:45,342
Really? Is That
Why You Dumped Daniel

579
00:29:45,374 --> 00:29:46,995
The Second He Got In The Way
Of Your Career Ambitions?

580
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:48,748
I Guess I Shouldn't
Be Surprised.

581
00:29:48,748 --> 00:29:50,765
That's Exactly What Wilhelmina
Would Have Done.

582
00:29:50,765 --> 00:29:53,934
You Two Are A Lot More Alike
Than I Thought.

583
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,379
Happy Shredding.

584
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:07,440
 <I>(Wilhelmina) Betty, You've</I>
 <I>Proved You Have Rare Potential.</I>
 <I>(Daniel) Look, If You Want</I>
 <I>To Go Work For Wilhelmina,</I> <I>Be My Guest.</I>

585
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,291
<I>...Maybe You Were</I>
 <I> The One.</I>

586
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:11,135
 <I>If You Think</I>
 <I>You'd Be So Much Happier</I>
 <I>Working For Wilhelmina, Go.</I>

587
00:30:11,135 --> 00:30:12,635
 <I>(Marc) You Two Are A Lot More</I>
 <I>Alike Than I Thought.</I>

588
00:30:12,635 --> 00:30:14,241
 <I>I'm So Numb Up There I</I>
 <I>Wouldn't Know If You Hit Bone.</I>

589
00:30:14,681 --> 00:30:18,948
There You Are, Madame Editrix.
Thank You, Marc.

590
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:23,918
Now Be A Dear And Go Fetch Me
Some Carrot Shavings.

591
00:30:23,918 --> 00:30:25,715
I'm Feeling Snack-Ish.

592
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:29,364
What The Hell
Are You All Staring At?

593
00:30:29,364 --> 00:30:31,351
Don't You Have Some Work
To Screw Up?

594
00:30:31,351 --> 00:30:34,958
Look At Me When I'm Yelling
At You! Don't Look At Me.

595
00:30:34,992 --> 00:30:36,644
You--Go Fix Your Teeth.

596
00:30:36,644 --> 00:30:38,951
You--Stop Eating That Doughnut.

597
00:30:38,951 --> 00:30:41,025
You--Lose 10 Pounds.

598
00:30:41,025 --> 00:30:43,088
You're Fired. You're Fired.

599
00:30:43,088 --> 00:30:45,591
You're All Fired.

600
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:47,378
Hi, Betty.
Uh, It's Daniel.

601
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:50,096
Remember?
We Used To Work Together.
No Time.

602
00:30:50,096 --> 00:30:52,352
No, No, No.
Betty, I Just Want To--
Security!

603
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:54,725
No, No, No. Wait. Wait.
W-Wait. Wait.

604
00:30:54,725 --> 00:30:57,592
No. I Just Wanted To
Ask You A Question. Please.

605
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:03,925
What The Hell Is That?

606
00:31:07,134 --> 00:31:08,589
Not The Puppy!

607
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,725
Well, Big Date
With The Coach Tonight?

608
00:31:37,598 --> 00:31:41,528
Not Wearing That.
Mom, Leopard And Zebra?

609
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,570
They Fight Each Other
In The Wild.

610
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,180
You'll Never Survive
The Evening.

611
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:49,615
I Think She Looks Beautiful.
You Know Why? She's Happy.

612
00:31:49,615 --> 00:31:52,825
I'm Not.
Look, Work With Me Here.

613
00:31:52,858 --> 00:31:54,107
This Is What I Do.

614
00:31:54,107 --> 00:31:56,145
Okay. Thank You.

615
00:31:56,145 --> 00:31:57,213
You're Welcome.

616
00:31:57,213 --> 00:31:58,863
And Thank You, <I>Papi.</I>

617
00:31:58,946 --> 00:32:01,624
You Deserve This, <I>Mija.</I>

618
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:03,558
(Sighs) Yeah.

619
00:32:03,591 --> 00:32:06,524
Yeah. I Do.

620
00:32:09,925 --> 00:32:11,082
Okay.

621
00:32:11,332 --> 00:32:14,798
I Know You're Tired Of Me
Saying This, But I Have To.

622
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:17,708
You Are Wasting Your Time
And Your Talent At "Player."

623
00:32:17,708 --> 00:32:19,874
You Are A Good Editor.
Betty--

624
00:32:19,908 --> 00:32:22,341
I'm Not Finished.
You Belong At "Mode," Daniel.

625
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:24,741
It Is The Most Important
Magazine At This Company,

626
00:32:24,774 --> 00:32:26,240
Your Family's Company.

627
00:32:26,274 --> 00:32:28,207
You Were Good At Your Job,

628
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,541
And If You Don't Believe Me,
Then Read These.

629
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:32,041
Wilhelmina Had Somebody Hide

630
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,150
All The Positive
Letters To The Editor
When You Were In Charge.

631
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:38,274
She Was Gonna Have Me
Shred Them.
They're All Positive?

632
00:32:38,307 --> 00:32:40,274
All Of Them,
And There Are Tons.

633
00:32:40,307 --> 00:32:42,274
Your June Cover--
The One That She Said Was,

634
00:32:42,307 --> 00:32:45,708
"A Pimple On The Butt
Of Fashion"...
Oh. She Said That?

635
00:32:45,741 --> 00:32:48,282
Not The Point.
These People Loved It.

636
00:32:48,282 --> 00:32:49,945
And "'Mode' Girl On Madison"?

637
00:32:49,945 --> 00:32:52,808
Some Of These People Said
They Subscribed Just For That.

638
00:32:52,841 --> 00:32:55,541
Daniel, You Have
To Show These To Alexis.

639
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:59,071
(Scoffs) Come On.
She Doesn't Care About Me.
She Cares About "Mode."

640
00:32:59,071 --> 00:33:01,441
Yeah. Okay, Look.

641
00:33:02,096 --> 00:33:04,538
I Really Appreciate
What You're Doing.

642
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,908
And, Yes, Of Course I Want
To Be Back At "Mode."

643
00:33:07,941 --> 00:33:10,874
Why Do You Think
I Got So Mad At You, Betty?

644
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:13,951
Because You're There
Reminding Me Of That
Every Single Day.

645
00:33:17,481 --> 00:33:21,107
Wilhelmina Won. I Lost.
It's Over.

646
00:33:22,381 --> 00:33:25,075
Daniel,
Anything You Truly Want...

647
00:33:25,778 --> 00:33:27,774
Has To Be Worth Fighting For.

648
00:33:39,274 --> 00:33:42,941
You Used Me! You Just Wanted
The Money To Buy Drugs!

649
00:33:42,975 --> 00:33:47,177
Christina, That's Not True.
Oh, I Think It Is, Because I Had
A Piece Of Your Hair Tested.

650
00:33:47,177 --> 00:33:48,088
What?

651
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,425
They Found Oxycontin, Heroin.

652
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:54,458
It's Like Rush Limbaugh
Fornicated With Amy Winehouse,

653
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,630
And They Spawned You.
You Had Me Tested?

654
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,459
Yes, I Did. Why, Have You Got
A Problem With That?

655
00:34:00,176 --> 00:34:02,424
You Don't Understand.
Now Just Listen To--

656
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:05,324
Just Get Your Hands Off Me!

657
00:34:05,358 --> 00:34:06,890
I Swear To God,

658
00:34:06,924 --> 00:34:08,825
I Am This Close
To Calling Immigration

659
00:34:08,857 --> 00:34:10,558
And Having You Deported.

660
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:13,510
(Laughs) Aye. Right.

661
00:34:13,591 --> 00:34:15,424
Oh, What? You Don't Thinki Would Do It?

662
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:17,558
Just You Watch Me.

663
00:34:35,724 --> 00:34:37,258
Yes! Papa.

664
00:34:37,258 --> 00:34:39,387
Looki Made It
To The Next Level.

665
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:46,087
Would You Come Here
For A Second?

666
00:34:47,063 --> 00:34:49,597
Uh, There...

667
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,664
There's Something
I Want To Ask You.

668
00:34:51,697 --> 00:34:53,366
It's Important.

669
00:34:55,764 --> 00:35:00,964
Okay, So Your Grandparents
Want You To Come Live
With Them In France.

670
00:35:01,752 --> 00:35:02,849
 <I>Comprend?</I>

671
00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:04,066
 <I>Oui, Oui.</I>

672
00:35:04,066 --> 00:35:07,119
Um, <I>Mais,</I> Uh, <I>Je Veux...</I>

673
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,097
 <I>Que Tu,</I> Uh,

674
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,797
 <I>Habite Avec Moi.</I>

675
00:35:10,831 --> 00:35:14,030
I-I-I Want You
To Live Here... With Me.

676
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,197
Look, I Guess...

677
00:35:16,874 --> 00:35:19,808
I Guess What's
M-Most Important Here Is...

678
00:35:21,063 --> 00:35:22,664
What Do You Want?

679
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,630
You... Are My Father.

680
00:35:28,664 --> 00:35:33,030
And... I Want To Stay
With My Father.

681
00:35:34,831 --> 00:35:37,797
Okay. Great. Uh...

682
00:35:37,831 --> 00:35:38,844
Good.

683
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,023
So We'll Stay Together,

684
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:45,623
And, Um, And We're
Gonna Fight For That.

685
00:35:46,096 --> 00:35:49,497
Come On. Let's See
How Good You Are.

686
00:35:54,797 --> 00:35:57,530
Did You Get A Drink?

687
00:35:57,564 --> 00:36:00,397
Are You Having Fun?

688
00:36:02,831 --> 00:36:04,764
Betty,
You've Really Outdone Yourself.

689
00:36:04,797 --> 00:36:06,330
This Party Is Beautiful.

690
00:36:06,363 --> 00:36:08,597
You're Not Wearing
The Tiara.

691
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,096
(Scoffs) Oh, God, No.

692
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,063
I'm The Editor-In-Chief
Of A Fashion Magazine.

693
00:36:12,096 --> 00:36:14,574
I Wouldn't Be Caught Dead
In A Tiara.

694
00:36:14,697 --> 00:36:17,397
Right.
Of Course You Wouldn't.

695
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:20,096
Well, This Is For You.

696
00:36:21,664 --> 00:36:24,163
It's My Two Weeks' Notice.

697
00:36:24,197 --> 00:36:27,230
I Thought I Could Work For You,
But I Can't.

698
00:36:27,263 --> 00:36:29,730
I Do Want To Be Successful,

699
00:36:29,764 --> 00:36:31,163
Just...

700
00:36:31,197 --> 00:36:33,230
Not By Hurting People.

701
00:36:34,697 --> 00:36:36,765
I Really Misjudged You,
Betty.

702
00:36:36,963 --> 00:36:40,030
Under Those Gaping Pores
And Caveman Eyebrows,

703
00:36:40,063 --> 00:36:42,730
I Thought You Were Smart.

704
00:36:42,764 --> 00:36:45,464
You Think Life Is All About
Who's Right And Who's Wrong,

705
00:36:45,497 --> 00:36:48,330
But History Is Written
By Those Who Win,

706
00:36:48,363 --> 00:36:50,931
Not By Those
Who Are The Nicest.

707
00:36:52,397 --> 00:36:54,797
Enjoy Your Party.

708
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:59,764
Betty, Why Don't You Stay?

709
00:36:59,797 --> 00:37:03,430
This Party Is About
To Get Very Interesting.

710
00:37:22,996 --> 00:37:23,660
(Tony) Hello?

711
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:27,230
Hey, Tony. Are--Are You Here
Yet? 'Cause I Don't See You.

712
00:37:27,263 --> 00:37:29,658
Oh, Hey... Bobby. Uh, Sorry
I Didn't Call You Back.

713
00:37:29,658 --> 00:37:32,155
I Had A Family Thing
Come Up.

714
00:37:33,263 --> 00:37:35,897
She Didn't Go Out Of Town?
You're Not Coming?

715
00:37:35,931 --> 00:37:37,397
Yeah, That's Right.

716
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:39,386
Um, Can I Follow Up
With You Tomorrow?

717
00:37:39,963 --> 00:37:41,462
Is She There With You Now?

718
00:37:41,462 --> 00:37:43,902
Sure. Sounds Good. All Right,
We'll--We'll Talk Tomorrow.

719
00:37:52,363 --> 00:37:53,864
Honestly, Alexis,

720
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:56,497
If This Is About A Bunch
Of Ridiculous Letters,

721
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:58,619
I Can Assure You--
This Isn't
Just About The Letters.

722
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:01,363
I'm Not Happy
With The Magazine.

723
00:38:01,397 --> 00:38:04,096
I Think Your Cover Is Cold.

724
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:07,096
Well, I Had
A Very Specific Vision.

725
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:09,063
I Didn't Expect You
To Understand It.

726
00:38:09,096 --> 00:38:11,764
Well, I Guess It Was Lost
On A Few Other People, Too.

727
00:38:11,797 --> 00:38:15,297
Your First Day
Sales Numbers Are In...

728
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:18,230
And They're Not Good.
Impossible.

729
00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:22,096
Your Relaunch Of "Mode" Is Our
Lowest Selling Issue In Months.

730
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,831
While You're Valued Here
As Our Creative Director,

731
00:38:24,864 --> 00:38:26,538
I've Made A Decision.

732
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:28,263
If You'll Excuse Me.

733
00:38:28,297 --> 00:38:31,597
Ladies And Gentlemen,
If I Could Have Your Attention.

734
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:35,128
I'm Happy To Announce That
Tonight We Are Welcoming Back

735
00:38:35,128 --> 00:38:39,127
As Editor-In-Chief Of
"Mode" Magazine--Daniel Meade.

736
00:38:51,938 --> 00:38:53,116
Betty.

737
00:38:54,196 --> 00:38:55,462
Marc.

738
00:38:56,219 --> 00:38:57,832
Well, Here We Are,

739
00:38:57,953 --> 00:39:00,719
As If Nothing's Changed.

740
00:39:00,753 --> 00:39:03,286
You Left Those Letters For Me,
Didn't You?

741
00:39:03,319 --> 00:39:06,292
You Planned This Whole Thing
So That I Would
Be Back With Daniel

742
00:39:06,292 --> 00:39:08,544
And You Could Have Wilhelmina
All To Yourself.

743
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:11,362
Oh. Don't Be Absurd.

744
00:39:11,362 --> 00:39:14,244
I Would Never Do Anything
To Hurt
Wilhelmina's Interests...

745
00:39:16,553 --> 00:39:18,388
Unless They're Hurting Mine.

746
00:39:23,085 --> 00:39:25,953
Don't Forget. I Still Own
A Third Of This Company.

747
00:39:25,986 --> 00:39:29,452
Your <I>Unborn Child</I> Owns A Third
Of This Company, Not You.

748
00:39:29,486 --> 00:39:32,278
 <I>You</I> Would Be Nothing
Without That Baby.

749
00:39:32,278 --> 00:39:34,458
But Don't Worry. You're Still
Our Creative Director.

750
00:39:34,553 --> 00:39:37,411
Yeah, And I'm More Than Happy
To Have You Come Work For Me.

751
00:39:37,747 --> 00:39:39,413
You Can't Push Me Aside.

752
00:39:40,449 --> 00:39:41,891
Oh, Really?

753
00:39:54,803 --> 00:39:57,437
You Are Gonna Regret This.
I Swear.

754
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:01,631
Don't You Ever Threaten
My Children, Wilhelmina.

755
00:40:02,669 --> 00:40:07,870
You Have No Idea The Lengths
I Will Go To Protect Them.

756
00:40:23,515 --> 00:40:25,683
Look, Daniel, I'm Sorry.
Look, Betty,
I Never Wanted You To Leave.

757
00:40:25,683 --> 00:40:28,809
I Would Never Even Consider
Working For That--
Me First. Please.

758
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:31,212
Um, Thank You...

759
00:40:32,502 --> 00:40:34,418
For Having Faith In Me.

760
00:40:34,502 --> 00:40:36,787
That's What Friends Are For.

761
00:40:39,999 --> 00:40:41,754
You're Coming Back, Right?

762
00:40:42,435 --> 00:40:44,369
Well, That Depends...

763
00:40:44,369 --> 00:40:48,106
On Whether Or Not I Can Keep
The Raise Wilhelmina Gave Me.

764
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:51,864
??

765
00:40:52,614 --> 00:40:54,178
It's Good To Have You Back,
Daniel.

766
00:40:55,196 --> 00:40:56,628
It's Good To Be Back.

767
00:40:58,281 --> 00:40:59,998
Now Seriously,
About The Raise--

768
00:40:59,998 --> 00:41:03,914
You Know, Once You Go There,
You Can't Really Go Back.
(Laughs) Really?

769
00:41:22,667 --> 00:41:34,538
