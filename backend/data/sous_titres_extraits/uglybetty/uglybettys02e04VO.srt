00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,000
Qianqing

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,500
I was at your father's funeral.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,700
I bet you're just like him.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,800
No... i'm not.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,500
Partial retrograde amnesia?

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,400
She doesn't even remember
becoming a woman.

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,200
I wanted you to know that i talked
to charlie, and she admitted everything.

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,100
????

9
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,600
We're gonna do
a paternity test.

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,000
I am freakin'????

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,600
You are not an orphan.

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,800
I need to find my father

13
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,600
I'm gonna enroll
in a writing class.
Great.

14
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,800
I'm gonna be a writer.

15
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,400
Anybody here?
Dad?

16
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,600
We missed you.

17
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,600
(Man) "she kissed me,
but her lips were cold.

18
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,700
"I could never tell her
that i'd loved her all along.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
"She left for dusseldorf
that morning...

20
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,800
With my heart
in her backpack."

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
-==Http://www.Ragbear.Com==-

22
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,600
Applause? Really?

23
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,500
What did u told the class?

24
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,200
Why you like so much
about this piece?

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,600
Well, um, it was sweet,

26
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,600
And i really felt his pain.

27
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,500
Here's what i felt.

28
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,800
This class is called
"finding your voice."

29
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,700
It's for serious writers,

30
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,600
Not emotionally stunted
dilettantes!

31
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,800
I expect you people
to dig deeper!

32
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,300
Open those old wounds!

33
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,100
And if there are no old wounds,

34
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,800
Well, i always say,

35
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,500
"If you have nothing to write,
try killing yourself.

36
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,200
"If you fail, you'll have
something to write about.

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,600
If you succeed,
your troubles will be over."

38
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,900
Next week, a thousand words
on your most defining moment.

39
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,800
And you, clappy.

40
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,500
I'll be very interested
in what you have to say.

41
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,900
He called you "clappy"?

42
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,700
Yes. He's mean.

43
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,300
Like simon cowell,
but with a pulitzer,

44
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,200
And i can't just
be jordin sparks good,

45
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,700
I have to be kelly clarkson,
"miss independt" good.

46
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,300
I don't know
any of those people,

47
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,600
But i read your story,
and it was an a-Plus.

48
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,400
Dad, you like
everything i do.

49
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,500
When i was 10, youold me
i could  a model.

50
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,700
You could be a model.

51
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,800
A guy in a car once
told me i could be a model.

52
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,100
I know, hilda, i stopped you
from getting in that car.

53
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:28,800
Oh, yeah.

54
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,900
This is class
is phase one of my career.

55
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,300
I write, i get published,
i work my way to editor,

56
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,000
And then
i can run a magazine.

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,900
And then you
really will need a model.

58
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,200
See, i shoulda
got in that car.

59
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,800
It's not a joke, hilda.

60
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,700
If i can't even
get through this class,

61
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,600
Then my whole career
is out the window.

62
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,400
Eetheart, you had
straight a's in high school.

63
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,400
You graduated top of your class
at queens college.

64
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,900
Yeah, but that's not
the real world,

65
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,800
Which is why
i sent my sty to daniel.

66
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,000
He does this for a living.

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,300
He'll know if it's good...

68
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,400
Or if i'm gonna get voted off.

69
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,700
Hey, kiddo.

70
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,900
That, uh,
jacket's kinda big.

71
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
It was dad's.

72
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,000
It's badass.

73
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,800
So, justin,
how was your math test?

74
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,900
Kinda flunked it.

75
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,400
Whatevs. It's only
the first test of the year. It doesn't matter.

76
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,100
Oh, come on. When was the last
time you ever used algebra?

77
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,600
Why do you defend him?

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,100
He's never gotten an "f" before,
not even in gym.

79
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,800
Which he calls "the unhappy hour"

80
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,300
He will make up the test
something.

81
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,700
It's no big deal.

82
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,000
(Alexis) this whole woman thing
is hard.

83
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,100
It took me an hour and a half
to do this makeup.

84
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,200
I used everything i had.
You're supposed to, right?

85
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,200
I... think you can

86
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,500
Probably save some
for tomorrow.

87
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,700
I knew it was too much.

88
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,500
Sorry.

89
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,700
Still not used to heels.

90
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,800
I need more practice.

91
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,400
Maybe i should've stayed home.

92
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,200
Come on. The doctor said
the best thing for your memory--

93
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,500
Familiar surroundings.

94
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,300
I know you don't remember
the last two years,

95
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,300
But i know youemember
being alex.

96
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,000
He was a fantastic editor.

97
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,400
(Sighs) but in fashion,two years is a life time

98
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,200
Plus, now i'm the new guy.
I mean, chick.

99
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,900
Do chicks say "chick"?

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,700
And why is everyone
staring at my chest?

101
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,900
I don't know. You might
waa button another button,

102
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,800
Maybe try a bra.

103
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,800
It's boobs. It's crazy.
Th're everywhere.

104
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,300
Oh, honey, no, no, no.

105
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,600
Ladies' room, now.

106
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,800
Friends don't let friends
wear glitter before noon.

107
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,800
Yeah. Yeah.

108
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,900
This is... phat.

109
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,900
What'd i tell you?
And as soon as this baby drops,

110
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,700
I'm gonna bust out
of accounting, man.

111
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,800
I'm-A be chillin' under
rihanna's umbrella--Ella.

112
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,000
Oh, uh, super phat.

113
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,500
(Betty) here's my time card.

114
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,200
Uh-Oh,ady parts, 12:00.

115
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,400
I don't know
how you do it, man.

116
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,400
????

117
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,000
You gotta teach me, young skywalker. Come on!

118
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,300
Obi-Wan's the t--Never mind.
Just get out of here.

119
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,600
Hey, henry.
Hey.

120
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,200
Kenny.

121
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,000
Betty. I'm just gonna
give you two some space here.

122
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,500
So i was wondering--
(Kenny) save it, boney.

123
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,000
Charlie hasn't heard back yet
about the paternity test.

124
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,900
Dude!

125
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,500
What? Sound does not stop
right here, man.
Would you just...

126
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,600
Actually, i'm not here
to talk about us...

127
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,500
For a change.

128
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,600
It's justin.
He's failing algebra.
What?

129
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,100
So i was thinking, sce
you're, like, a math genius,

130
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,600
Uh, maybe
you could tutor him?

131
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,900
Sure. Definitely.
He needs his algebra.

132
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,400
I mean,
we use it every day.

133
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,800
Great. Okay. Thank you.

134
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,200
Um, so... i guess
i'll see you later?

135
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,200
Yeah.

136
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,000
Okay.

137
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,800
Forget something?

138
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,700
Bye, kenny.

139
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,200
(Singsongy) i'm just looking
for some shoes.

140
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,300
Ah.

141
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,500
Mandy! You can't just leave
the reception desk empty.

142
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,100
Oh, my god. Are you making out
with that dog again?

143
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,100
Halston and i
needed a little me time.

144
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,300
Searching for our real father
is exhausting.

145
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Cai spoon, too?

146
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,700
So i'm guessing no luck
finding daddy?

147
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,600
Nada.

148
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,500
I googled fey.
I searched this stupid room.

149
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,000
I read her diary.
It's useless.

150
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,200
So fey never mentioned
any men?

151
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,600
Not a word.

152
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,600
Maybe we need
to find some pictures.

153
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,700
Every month,
the back page of "mode"

154
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,900
Was filled with pictures
of fey at dierent parties.

155
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,900
Go find some old issues

156
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,000
And see who fey was socializing
with the year of your birth.

157
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,400
Wait.
What year were you born?

158
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,700
1991.

159
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
You're 16?

160
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,400
1992.

161
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Other way.

162
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,700
Now i'm moving up
the british new rave piece.

163
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,500
I want a rrite
on "the five ways to fake it,"

164
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,100
And, phillip,
the trash can is going to enjoy

165
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,900
Your snooze-Inducing profile
on sienna miller.

166
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,200
Look who's back,
everyone.

167
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,700
(Wilhelmina) oh! Alexis.

168
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,300
So good to seeou, darling.
You... look fabulous.

169
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,800
(Whispers)
i'm not wearing a bra.

170
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
Ah. Power move.

171
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,500
I thought we could bring
alexis up to speed on the january issue.

172
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,500
(Clears throat) and i just want
to thank everyone in advance

173
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,800
For helping me cope
with my disability.

174
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,400
Just bear with me.

175
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,200
Well, uh, the january issue
is our ready-To-Wear issue.

176
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,500
Our chief advertiser
is atlantic attire,

177
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,800
And we will be featuring
the spring collection.

178
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,500
Sorry to interrupt,???

179
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,600
Do you mind scooting down?
You know, so...

180
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,300
Of course.

181
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,400
You are the coeditors.

182
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,900
You know, you should get
used to not having me around.

183
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,400
As we all know,
in a few weeks,

184
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,700
I will be leaving "mode"
to help run meade publications

185
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,200
And the meade family.

186
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,200
So, uh, sheila,
uh, future creative director,

187
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,400
Why don't you
just take it away?

188
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,500
Toodles.

189
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,400
What a pleasant surprise.

190
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,700
This isn't about the wedding,
is it?

191
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,100
No, i came up to talk to you about
my new position at the company.

192
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,200
Now i'm thinking,
after the wedding...

193
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,000
Well, what--What's
with that look?

194
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,500
Oh, i'm just a bit surprised,
that's all.

195
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,400
I didn't think
you'd be coming in that often.

196
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,600
Claire always spent her days--
Drinking and murdering fey?

197
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,400
Well, your ex-Wife and i
are very different women.

198
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,500
In case you haven't noticed,
i'm a career g.

199
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,400
You know
i likeo be hands-On.

200
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,300
And that's
what i le about you.

201
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,300
Unh-Unh-Unh.
Business first.

202
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,400
Well, as cochair of meade,

203
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,200
You could have creative control
of any magazine you like, apart from--

204
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,300
"Mode." I know.

205
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,300
Claire has
made that impossible.

206
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,400
There are 22 other publications
in this building.

207
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Well, perhaps i should
familiarize myself with them.

208
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,500
Absolutely.
Talk to the editors.

209
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,900
They're the people you're gonna
be spending your time with.

210
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,900
Now in the meantime,
there is something over here

211
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,300
That you could be
a little more hands-On with.

212
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,400
(Sheila) and that's our
travel feature for ts month.

213
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,000
Great.
So who's the cover?

214
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,400
Well, actually, we might have
lost winona ryr to a movie.

215
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,300
Not re whether she's making
one or just going to see one.

216
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,200
I have an idea.

217
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,200
Great.
Alexis, let's hear it.

218
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,300
Well, um,
when i was at hudson,

219
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,700
Uh, everyone was doing
johnny depp, brad pitt.

220
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,300
We did bill murray
right before "rushmore."

221
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,400
This is a great opportunity
for a comeback.
(Sheila) really?

222
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,600
Readers love the underdog.
Listen and learn, people.

223
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,000
She's big.

224
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,600
She's sexy.

225
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,600
She's outrageous.

226
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,200
Anna nicole smith.

227
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,400
Bam!

228
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,900
Hey, there y are.

229
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,400
(Crying)
are you crying?

230
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,300
I'm a girl.
I'm allowed to now.

231
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,900
I made a fool of myself
in there.

232
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,500
You know what?

233
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,600
Maybe we are
rushing this thing.

234
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,800
Why don't you
take tomorrow off?

235
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,000
But we have
that photo shoot

236
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,500
And the meeting
with atlantic attire and...

237
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,500
Something else. I forget.

238
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,500
Damn it!
I forget everything!

239
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,400
Hey, hey.

240
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,900
Come on.
You're gonna be fine.

241
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,200
You need to trust
your instincts.

242
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,400
You are
doing everything right.

243
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,800
Oh, and by the way,
you're in the men's room.
(Laughs)

244
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,200
Daniel, i called luke carnes
at atlantic attire,

245
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,300
Told him you'll be attending
the meeting without alexis.

246
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,900
Here's his bio and all his
previous advertising layouts.

247
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,000
Also, your personal trainer
got ved to 2:00.

248
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,600
And you do know en i say
"personal trainer,"

249
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,800
That's code for...
(whispers) pedicure.

250
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
I know, betty. ????

251
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,100
Hm.
Oh, and one more thing.

252
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,100
I need you to read these
female empowerment articles.

253
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,200
Let me know what you think.

254
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,600
I heard the bear one's
pretty good.

255
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,800
You know, i would do it,
but i ha my, uh, book club.

256
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,000
And when you say "book club,"
that's code for "hot date."

257
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,900
Really, betty? I mean, what's
the poinin having codes?

258
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,600
So, uh,
i have plans tonight, too.

259
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,600
Going to my writing class.

260
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,900
Really? Great.

261
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,300
Have fun.

262
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,100
I will. You know, uh,
reading my essay?

263
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,600
Out loud, for everyone?

264
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Cool.

265
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,700
I'm such an idiot.

266
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,100
Your essay, of course.

267
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,900
It's great work.
I gave you a gold star.

268
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,400
Really loved it.

269
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,800
He hated it.

270
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,100
But i thought
he said it was great?

271
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,300
What's the problem?
Well, he did,

272
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,300
But he gave me that fake smile
and the thumbs-Up.

273
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,200
He always does that
when he's lying.

274
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,700
Hey. Call me lat.

275
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,100
Oh, definitely.

276
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,100
(Bradford) did you read the quarterly
competite analysis?

277
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,800
Veti.????

278
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,100
Ready, slave?

279
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,600
Okay.

280
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,200
But i mes , th. Idaniel

281
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,100
He's not exactly the arbiter
of great literature, is he?

282
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,700
Let's face it. The only reason
he's here is because of his dad.

283
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,500
Well, maybe it started that way,
but he's proven himself.

284
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,200
Daniel is very smart...

285
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,100
In a high five kinda way,

286
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,600
And he's the first person
who ever believed in me,

287
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,200
So ????

288
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,700
Oh, sweetheart, i'm sure
your story is lovely.

289
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,900
What's it about again?

290
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,200
I wrote about staying home
on prom night.

291
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,000
Oh, wow.
That sounds really sweet.

292
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,800
<I>no. The professor
wants grim and tortured.</I>

293
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,600
Damn it!
Why do i have to be so sweet?

294
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,100
"I saw the sun rise
over the valley

295
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,800
"For the first time
in ten years,

296
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,600
And i knew i was home."

297
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,800
The end.

298
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,500
Yes, jeremy, it is the end.

299
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,800
The end of literature.

300
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,800
Oh, god. Ionly i hadn't blown
that pulitzer money

301
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,200
At the indian casino.

302
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,400
Let the tortur continue.

303
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,800
You'rep, crappy.

304
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,100
Actually, it's...

305
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,100
Clappy.

306
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,800
I hope your thoughts are
better organized than your bag.

307
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,000
All right! There aren't
enough hours in the day!

308
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,000
"When i saw my blood dripping
off the bear's teeth... "

309
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,100
You stop now?

310
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,500
For the first time today,
i wasn't bored.

311
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,600
Read. Read!
Start with the title!

312
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,600
"Girl gone wild: how i survived
a bear attack."

313
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,800
By betty suarez.

314
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,300
So if the hemlines in fall 2001

315
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,300
Were 6 inches below the knee,

316
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:19,000
And the hemlin in fall 2006
were 2 inches above the knee,

317
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,500
What will the hemlines be
in 2012, given the current rate?

318
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,800
Who cares?

319
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,400
Oh.

320
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,400
I thought you liked
all this fashion stuff.

321
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,800
Uh... let's find
something else.

322
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,100
What--What are you into
these days?

323
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,300
Not algebra.

324
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,300
Okay.

325
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,300
Well, um, good work today.

326
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,700
See you tomorrow.

327
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,800
So, mr. Suarez,

328
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,200
Will betty be home soon?

329
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,400
You're here for justin.

330
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,300
Let's keep it about that.

331
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,400
Sure.

332
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,800
"And as i write this,

333
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,900
"Pregnant...

334
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,600
"With my first child...

335
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,700
I realize
i survived for a reason."

336
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,300
That...

337
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:24,590
Was exactly what i've been looking for.

338
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,290
Why can't the rest of you get attacked by a bear?

339
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,320
Your assignment for this week is to live dangerously.

340
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,590
Stop a knife fight. Take a bone from a pit bull.

341
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,190
Now!

342
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,310
Suarez!

343
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,020
Nice work.

344
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,870
It was worth almost having your ear torn off.

345
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,770
Just out of perverse curiosity,

346
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,030
May i see it?

347
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,590
No. I'm very self-Conscious.

348
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:55,840
I thought it was your right ear.

349
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,720
It is. When the bear was done with this one,

350
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,140
He started nibbling on that one. (Chuckles)

351
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,030
Stupid bear.

352
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,350
Stupid class.

353
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,530
Oh.

354
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,660
(High-Pitched male voice) you lying bitch.

355
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,420
Poquito?

356
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,330
Is that you?

357
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,640
Yeah,that's right. The bear's talking.

358
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,410
You didn't write that story.

359
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,100
You stole it.

360
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,550
I didn't mean to. It was a mistake.

361
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,730
Betty suarez is a cheater.

362
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,570
They laugh at me every day at "mode."

363
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,300
I didn't want them laughing at me in class,too,poquito.

364
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,280
Wanna know

365
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,570
What a bear attack really feels like,betty?

366
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,790
Poquito!

367
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:52,180
No! No!

368
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,930
(Wilhelmina) oh,marcie.

369
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,760
Yes???

370
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:01,900
Fix your makeup,doll.

371
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,980
We're heading up to the executive suite,

372
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,260
Where every magazine in the meade empire

373
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,930
Is coming to kiss the ring of the new cochair.

374
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,250
"Adventure time" is extreme,

375
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,760
Extremely extreme.

376
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,680
It's base jumping off the space needle. Huh!

377
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,360
It's surfing a tsunami. Huh!

378
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,970
It's basically anything that breaks bones or cracks teeth.

379
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:29,220
Our readers won't be satisfied until they've slammed into...

380
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,150
A chocolate souffl?

381
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,620
????

382
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,630
Ooh! And february's issu is devoted eirely to...

383
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,070
Crème fraîche!

384
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,590
Because we here at "cucina" believe that crème fraîche

385
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,260
Belongs on...

386
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,170
Boobs.

387
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,630
That's what our 30-Something straight male demo wants to see.

388
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,560
You're a talented lady. You could do this in your sleep.

389
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,130
Slap a hottie on the cover, throw in some articles

390
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:59,220
On fast cars, video games and guns,

391
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,670
And pop! You're ney.

392
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,360
Oh! The sml of prada!

393
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,120
(Sniffs) there's no place le home.

394
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,980
This isn't our home anymore, marc. We have no home.

395
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,360
I'm gonna be stuck upstairs in that executive suite

396
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,970
Dealing with those commoners. Willie,think we may have made a terrible mistake.

397
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,200
I know. All i wanted to do was run a fashion magazine.

398
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,810
I s a simple girl with an evil plan.

399
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,260
Fashion is our passion!

400
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,650
But meade only has one fashion magazine,

401
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,060
And it will never be mine.

402
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:33,510
Oh! We're doomed! Doomed!

403
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:36,340
Off the floor,marc.

404
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,720
No,your instincts were right. Fall again.

405
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,220
Doomed!

406
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,760
(Daniel) i heard you're a cheater. What?

407
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,950
I said,i'm out of sweetener. Can you grab me some downstairs?

408
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,950
Oh. Yeah.

409
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,700
Hey,what's your bunny doing in the...

410
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,620
(Ring) daniel meade's office.

411
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,370
This is professor barrett. Is this betty suarez?

412
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,270
No.

413
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:20,550
Yes.

414
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,900
Come see me at 2:00. We need to discuss your essay.

415
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,430
So,luke,i'll talk to our advertisers,

416
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,000
But i can pretty much promise atlantic attire

417
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,160
Ten pages in our january issue at cut rate.

418
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,070
Good to be in business with you,danny boy,

419
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,520
And i like your style,too.

420
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,360
Just one thing i need you to help me out with,though,

421
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,980
Before i sign a big,fat check. Anything. Hit me.

422
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,450
It's about your sister. I didn't realize she would be

423
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,770
Coming back to work, aftethe accident and all.

424
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,340
Yeah, she really pulled through.

425
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,390
I mean,we're excited to have her back.

426
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:59,010
Yeah,see,that's the problem. Atlantic attire is innocent.

427
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,310
I'm not sure we want to be associated

428
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,900
With a magazine run by a cross-Dresser. Are you kidding with this?

429
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,540
Aw,come on. D't be all, "he's a hater."

430
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,330
I am the most tolerant man in town.

431
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,750
I got a black and a jew assistant,all right?

432
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,880
And the gays? Couldn't have an oscar party without 'em.

433
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,730
But i am a businessman. I got a company i'm trying to brand.

434
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,610
I got a hundred stores i'm opening next month.

435
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,910
I can't afford to be associated

436
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,640
With the whole he/she element. Are you asking me to fire my own sister to get your account?

437
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:26,430
Dude,it sucks. I get it.

438
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,210
I had to give up the... (sniffs) you know what i'm saying?

439
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,250
But these,my brother,

440
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,440
Are the sacrifices we gotta make for the bottom line.

441
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:35,160
You think about it and you get back to me.

442
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,290
Ms. Suarez.

443
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,860
Professor barrett, i can explain.

444
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,610
It's very rare to find someone

445
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,360
Who can be so honest about their experience

446
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,350
This class is all about finding your voice,

447
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,810
And,well, consider yours found.

448
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,990
It is?

449
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,730
Your story moved me so much,

450
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,000
I just cldn'tbear to keep it to myself.

451
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:13,140
And that was not a pun. I never pun.

452
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,710
So what are you saying?

453
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,300
I sent it to a colleague,

454
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,600
An editor at "e new york review."

455
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,800
He'd like to see you... today.

456
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,980
Well,well,it...

457
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,200
But... but i...

458
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,150
U really do save it for the page,don't you?

459
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,260
I know you told me not to come in today,

460
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,150
But after spending the day playing with makeup,

461
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:41,300
I think i finally got it right.

462
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,990
So i came ino show it off.

463
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,950
How'd the meeting with the advertiser go?

464
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,130
Yeah,great.

465
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,100
Don't give me e smile and the thumb.

466
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:53,910
Okay. The truth?

467
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,020
I think i lost the account.

468
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:57,840
Why?

469
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,960
The guy had some issue with our staff. What? With who?

470
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,360
Doesn't matter. It's not his place.

471
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:06,870
Daniel, who are you protecting?

472
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,240
You.

473
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,520
<I>me? What did i ever do to him?</I>

474
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,480
Oh. I get it.

475
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,190
He doesn't want to sign with "mode"

476
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:28,140
Because the coeditor-In-Chief is...

477
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,790
Like this.

478
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,400
Hey,hey. Where are you going?

479
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,310
Maybe i should have just stayed home after all.

480
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,320
It's one advertiser. Don't let it get to you.

481
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,690
It's not worth it. No,i'm not worth it. Look at me,i'm a mess.

482
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,180
I drove away that advertiser.

483
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,520
I practically killed us both in that accident.

484
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,050
I told you, that wasn't your fault.

485
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,020
Yes,it was! I can't do anything right.

486
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,930
I can't drive. I cat do my job.

487
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:59,250
Uh! And i can't freakin' walk in these!

488
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,680
(Marc) i'm okay.

489
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,720
Come on,halston. Help me out here.

490
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,920
I'm trying to find our daddy.

491
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,670
Just bark if you see someone you recognize.

492
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:23,020
Ooh. "Mousse-- The 'it' beauty product." (Whimps)

493
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:26,070
I heart the '80s.

494
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,930
What is it,boy?

495
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,730
(Gasps) "editor-In-Chief, fey sommers,

496
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,050
And her assistant,wanda, the palladium."

497
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,470
Who the hell is wanda?

498
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,460
Okay,slim the nose,

499
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,190
Add about 20 years,

500
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,350
A little botox.

501
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:56,180
Yes,yes.

502
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,230
Oh... my... dog.

503
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,620
(Barks) ugly willie.

504
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:07,230
What did you just call me?

505
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,710
You're saying no to "the new york revw"?

506
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:20,390
<I>"the new york revie?</I>

507
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,690
Do you have any idea how many doors this could open for you?

508
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,140
I'm sorry,but i...

509
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,740
I can't.

510
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,530
The truth is... (telephone rings)

511
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,130
Hello?

512
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:33,630
Yes,i'm sitting with her right now.

513
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:36,950
It's the legal department. What? But no one's done anything illegal.

514
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,130
We don't need lawyers.

515
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,720
It's just a routine fact check on your piece. Uh-Huh.

516
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,220
No. I haven'seen the ear yet.

517
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,350
Now what do i need to do

518
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,270
To convince you to let us print your piece?

519
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:55,000
Sir,what i am trying to tell you is that...

520
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,980
I work at "mode."

521
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,280
That thing with the clothes.

522
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,880
Yes,and if i were to let a competing magazine

523
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,320
Print my article without giving them first look,

524
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,460
Then they would fire me.

525
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:10,340
Definitely,they would fire me.

526
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,180
We couldn't let that happen

527
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,460
To someone who's expecting, now could we?

528
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:15,130
Expecting?

529
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:18,190
Oh! Yes,of course, my baby.

530
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,590
Well,thank you.

531
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,420
That is very kind.

532
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:27,400
You're carrying low.

533
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,460
It's a boy.

534
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,660
I can always tell.

535
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,800
Thank you.

536
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,520
Interesting fact-- Drop a penny

537
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,740
And a blonde receptionist from the 28th floor,

538
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,840
And they both hit the sidewalk at the same time.

539
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,200
I believe they call it,

540
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,190
Uh,terminal velocity.

541
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,610
Okay,i think

542
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,090
This is a really good time to point out...

543
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,100
(Lowers voice) that i am not a real blonde.

544
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:03,340
I thght i had gotten rid of all the pictures of wanda.

545
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:04,600
Apparently,i missed one.

546
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,640
I ll never speak of this again.

547
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:10,300
I don't even remember what we're talking about right now.

548
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,110
Okay,look,the only reason

549
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,460
I was looking at old pictures of fey

550
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:22,550
Is because i'm trying to figure out who my real father is.

551
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,040
Even if i wanted to express sympathy,

552
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,980
I physically can't.

553
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:30,120
Okay,so... if you're not gonna hurt me,

554
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,160
Then i'll just...

555
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,800
There's just one more thing.

556
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,860
According to the date on those photos,

557
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,070
You were my mother's assistant during her pregnancy.

558
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,550
Oh,please,wilhelmina.

559
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,790
You're my last hope.

560
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,950
Is there any chance that you know who my father is?

561
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,480
April 26,1981.

562
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:01,380
Studio 54.

563
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:04,500
<I>it was the early days of glam rock fashion.</I>

564
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,400
<I>liza's between gay husbands,</i>

565
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,390
<I>and the party celebrating fey's first issue of "mode"</i>

566
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,370
<I>is in full swing.</I>

567
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,740
<I>it's snowing everywhere,</i>

568
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,250
????

569
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(Blondie) seemed li* the real thing

570
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,510
<I>i quicck oy lor.Raf he</i>

571
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:24,770
<I>then i hear fey's distinctive laugh.</I>

572
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,540
<I>i didn't see anything</i>

573
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,700
<I>but the tweety bird tattoo on his ass.</I>

574
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,140
I was conceived during studio 54?

575
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,180
I knew there was glamour in my genes.

576
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,660
When fey started puking up her breakfast,

577
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,540
She was thrilled...

578
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,320
Until she realized she was pregnant.

579
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,980
She swore me to secrecy,

580
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,700
And in exchange, paid for my transfmation

581
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:59,000
From mousy assistant wanda

582
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,210
Into supermodel wilhelmina.

583
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,460
So you know who he is?

584
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,680
No.

585
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,310
Oh.

586
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:12,010
Thanks anyway.

587
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,230
Amanda.

588
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:18,380
I've done a lot to put wanda behind me.

589
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,010
Your secres safe with me.

590
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,950
I've put my blood,
sweat and old nose into this place.

591
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:31,440
If i can't have "mode,"

592
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,670
No one else can.

593
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:47,680
Daniel,i want to talk
to you about luke carnes.

594
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,890
I already know what you're gonna say.

595
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:53,860
I have nintention of asking alexis to step down.
You underestimate me, daniel.

596
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:56,920
I think we should lo the account. What?

597
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,700
We don't need atlantic attire or their money.

598
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,570
We have dozens of other loyal advertisers.

599
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,160
Why would you back me on this?

600
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:08,700
(Sighs) daniel, whether you like it or not,

601
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,380
We're about to become a family,

602
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:14,340
And family sticks together.

603
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,630
Soluke,

604
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,930
Let's talk about this account.

605
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,050
Where do i sign?

606
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:27,960
Actually,uh,you don't.

607
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,280
You see,"mode" doesn't need to be associated with bigots.

608
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:35,480
You're turning down ten pages for a man in a skirt?

609
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:38,870
That man is my sister.

610
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:45,580
Dude,i'm trying to help you out.

611
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:49,250
I don't need your help, dude.

612
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,010
Oh! Oh!

613
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,250
Betty. Henry.

614
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,960
So i totally sucked at tutoring yesterday.

615
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,020
I referred to nine as a prime number.

616
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:11,920
Can you imagine? Nine--Only divisible by one and itself?

617
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,380
I completely forgot about three. Oh,no.

618
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:17,430
I know, but i am not giving up.

619
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,620
I stayed up all night,

620
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,240
And i came up with some awesome new stuff. You did?

621
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,760
I'm gonna dress up like pythagoras

622
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,720
And teach him the pythagorean theorem.

623
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,610
That's so sweet. Thank you,um,for caring.

624
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:32,850
Oh,well,a boy needs his... algebra.

625
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,250
Okay.

626
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:37,240
Catch you later,calculator.

627
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,990
Bye.

628
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,090
Excuse me.

629
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,060
Hi. Can i help you?

630
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,180
You must be betty suarez.

631
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,380
Uh-Huh.

632
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,430
I hear we have a lot in common.

633
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:06,970
First i was victimized by a grizzly and now you.

634
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:10,230
I'm not sure which is worse. Ms. Worthington, i can explain.

635
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:12,970
Please explain why i got a call from my agent

636
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,320
Telling me the story i submitted to "mode"

637
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,830
Ended up at "the new york review" with your name on it.

638
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,460
Well, i didn't mean for it to--

639
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,530
We'd be happy to.

640
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:26,870
Hi. Daniel meade, editor-In-Chief. Nice to meet you.

641
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,700
You'll be the second person i name in my lawsuit.

642
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:32,780
No,daniel,ms. Worthington, this was all my mistake.

643
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:35,010
It was a big,huge mistake.

644
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:39,170
Actually,it was mine. See, i had two stories on my desk.

645
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,170
I must have mixed up the covers, becausi sent the one

646
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,080
I thought was betty's

647
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,980
To a friend of mine at "new york review,"

648
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,180
<I>and he flipped over the story. Your story,unfortunately.</I>

649
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,660
That is not the unfortunate part,if you ask me.

650
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:53,050
Yes,it is, because there is no way "mode"

651
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:56,590
Would let anyone else publish your amazing piece.

652
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:01,550
In fact,we're prepared to offer you double your fee.

653
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:04,760
I'm sorry. Talk into the good ear.

654
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,020
Did you say double?

655
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:06,840
Absolutely.

656
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:11,420
Well,i will think of something else for "the new york review."

657
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:14,150
Next summer i'm going diving in australia.

658
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,710
Lots of shar there.

659
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,910
Fingers crossed.

660
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,020
Betty,why don't you escort ms. Worthington down

661
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,490
And get the contract signed?

662
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:24,510
And when you're done, stop by my office.

663
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,930
We he to have a little chat.

664
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,160
(Henry) hello?

665
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,870
Hello?

666
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,680
Justin?

667
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,570
I--

668
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:37,640
Justin?

669
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,980
Justin!

670
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,830
What's your damage,yo?

671
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,430
Are you here alone?

672
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:52,210
You're supposed to be working on your algebra,not making out.

673
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,380
And--And i'm sure you're very nice,

674
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,860
But you really shouldn't be wearing clothes like that

675
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:59,200
Until... ever.

676
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,180
<I>and you're drinking? It's just beer.</I>

677
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,000
<I>beer is a gateway drug.</I>

678
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,230
Justin.

679
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,040
Back off. You're not my dad!

680
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,210
I...

681
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:19,240
What were you thinking?

682
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,200
????

683
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,860
How much trouble you could've gotten into?

684
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:27,430
I know! I know. It was stupid,but i...

685
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,290
I got so nervous,

686
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,600
And you read my story,

687
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:34,020
And you gave me that fake smile and the thumbs-Up.

688
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:37,270
Wait. Does everybody know about that?

689
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,590
Look,daniel, i know you didn't like it,

690
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,930
So i read that woman's story,

691
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,180
But i never thought it was gonna get so out of control.

692
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:47,350
You did all this becausei didn

693
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:51,110
Yeah. I mean,your opinion means a lot to me.

694
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:53,320
That's crazy. Why do you even care what i think?

695
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:57,300
Because you're the editor of "mode,"

696
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,040
And you're my friend.

697
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,170
Betty...

698
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:08,890
You can't put me on a pedestal. I mean,trust me,

699
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,570
I don't deserve it. You know as well as i do,

700
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,450
The only reason i'm in this job is because of my father.

701
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,550
Well,that's just what everybody else says.

702
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,710
Everybody says that?

703
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,460
Daniel,it doesn't matter.

704
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:22,600
You are good at this, and you're getting better,

705
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,850
And...

706
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,710
Wait. This is supposed to be my pep talk.

707
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:29,490
Okay,then you should have faith in yourself.

708
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,360
You're gonna get better,too.

709
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:35,370
I mean,maybe your story... wasn't that great--

710
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,140
Do you understand the meaning of "pep talk"?

711
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,380
Maybe it wasn't that great, but--There is a but--

712
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,090
It doesn't matter what i think.

713
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,840
It doesn't matter what your professor thinks.

714
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:47,470
Do you like your story?

715
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:51,870
Well... the spelling was impeccable

716
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,640
And there were some funny lines.

717
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,870
See? I mean,there you go.

718
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,830
It's okay to make mistakes.

719
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,880
You just have to learn from them.

720
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,900
I kn i do.

721
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:15,400
Guest list. Studio 54.

722
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:18,500
I was a good assistant.

723
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,570
And just so you know,

724
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:23,340
????

725
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:25,090
Eventually.

726
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,880
Now if that doesn't say love,

727
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:30,500
I don't know what does.

728
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please turn off your cell phones.

729
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The show is about to begin.

730
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

731
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

So come join the excitement

735

Where everyone is a star.

737
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
New from fisher-Price.

738
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Once upon a time

739
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A sleepy baby came upon an enchanted ocean

740
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With calming bubbles and gentle music.

741
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The new fisher-Price ocean wonders aquarium.

742
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shhhhhh

743
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:48,430
Hey,whoa,whoa! Hey,buddy. Uncool.

744
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,110
It's just me.

745
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,130
Didn't we just have the men's bathroom conversation yesterday?

746
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:55,530
I just heard what happen with atlantic attire.

747
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,720
I-I can't believe you did that.

748
00:36:56,870 --> 00:37:00,230
You're the best brother the world. No,i'm not.

749
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,590
Not even close. Come on,daniel. You totally stood up for me.

750
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,180
Lo,stop it. Why are you bein so weird about this?

751
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:07,430
You took care of me.

752
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,250
You' been taking care of me since the accident.

753
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,480
Look,i can't do this anymore.

754
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,760
Get out.

755
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,110
It wasn't your fault.

756
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,800
What?

757
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:25,240
The accident. It was my fault.

758
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:28,320
I thought you said i swerved to miss a deer.

759
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:31,450
Yeah,i lied. I was drunk. I was spun out on pills.

760
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:33,570
You were speeding to try and get me to help.

761
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,880
As usual,i was the screwup.

762
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,070
I'm the reason you almost died.

763
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:43,260
It was my fault.

764
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:57,290
It was just an accidt.

765
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,370
Hi,daddy.

766
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,770
Oh,and hello to you,too,pops.

767
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,040
Mm.

768
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,650
<I>hola,papi.</I>

769
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,840
You were all at studio 54 that night,

770
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,360
And i will find that tweety bird

771
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,250
If i have to search every one of your asses.

772
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:30,130
Big,big,big,big,big,big, big,big,big,big,big,big.

773
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,590
I just talked to tommy at ralph lauren

774
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,080
Who talked to ralph at tommy hilfiger

775
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,320
Who slept with calvin at donna karan

776
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,250
Who had drinks with karen at calvin klein--

777
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:39,830
Point? They all know about atlantic attire pulling out.

778
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:40,840
And now all those companies

779
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,320
Are talking about pulling their advertising,too.

780
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:47,600
People are saying that "mode" is in trouble.Wonder who start

781
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,920
Oh,my god. It's happened.

782
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,510
The botox has finally seeped into your brain.

783
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:56,530
What are you doing? I took lemons and made a lemon martini.

784
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,340
So you want to destroy "mode"?

785
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,070
????

786
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,680
But i don't understand. Why?

787
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,550
Follow the bread crumbs, gretel.

788
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,860
There's only room for one fashion magazine

789
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,270
At meade publications,

790
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:13,690
<I>but if something were to happen to "mode,"</i>

791
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:15,820
There would be room for...

792
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,780
Holy rosie,oprah,martha!

793
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:28,640
"Slater"--The fashion luxury magazine of the future.

794
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,080
It will rise like a phoenix

795
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:34,620
From the ashes of "mode."

796
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,190
Henry,what's going on?

797
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:54,220
It's justin. He's a mess,and ican't

798
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:57,680
What are you talking about? Well,i got here tonight and found him kissing a girl--

799
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,160
With tongue-- And drinking beer.

800
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,020
Are you kidding? This is all my fault. I should have been here earlier.

801
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,250
Henry,it's not your fault.

802
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,290
Justin's going through some rough times.

803
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:12,140
He's gonna make mistakes. That's what kids do. I didn't have a sip of beer until college,

804
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:13,530
And i threw up alover the quad.

805
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:15,710
In fact,i hope he's up there throwing up right now. Henry.

806
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,630
Well,it might be good for him. Maybe he'll learn his lesson.

807
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:21,810
Or not. I don't know. Tough love?

808
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:24,850
Okay. Stop freaking out. This is lda's responsibility.

809
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:26,660
Well,i should know what to do, and i n't.

810
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:28,050
Why do you need to know what to do?

811
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:31,410
Because i'm gonna be a father!

812
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,470
Oh.

813
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,060
So the baby's yours?

814
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,690
Well, how long have you known?

815
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,070
A couple days.

816
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:52,000
I didn't want to tell you because...

817
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,900
As long as you didn't know, there was still...

818
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,070
I don't know...

819
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:01,610
Some fantasy where you and i could be together.

820
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:09,170
I'm sorry,betty.

821
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,770
You should go.

822
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,170
(Bet) sometimes we want things to be different.

823
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:34,380
We think maybe if we pretend that they are,

824
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:37,500
Fool people,that's enough,

825
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,660
But it never is.

826
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:42,440
I know you all loved my last story,

827
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:45,230
But the truth is, it wasn't mine,

828
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:47,650
And all the wonderful
things you said about it

829
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:49,970
Just made me feel awful.

830
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:53,110
So i'm sorry for lying.

831
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:56,690
And today i want to share
with you my real story.

832
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,910
"Queen of my own prom."

833
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:06,430
By betty suarez.
