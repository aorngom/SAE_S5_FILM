1
00:00:02,378 --> 00:00:05,063
(Wilhelmina) I Can Make
This Whole Thing Go Away.
(Alexis) And What's
It Going To Cost Me?

2
00:00:05,113 --> 00:00:07,048
I'll Convince Her
To Split Her Shares,

3
00:00:07,147 --> 00:00:09,038
Sign Over Half To Daniel,
Half To You.

4
00:00:09,147 --> 00:00:13,690
You'll <I>Both
Be Editors-In-Chief.
Whatever Happens
With You And Your Wife,

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,378
I Can't Be Responsible For It.
They Can't Just Take Your Son.

6
00:00:17,378 --> 00:00:19,988
(Daniel) He's Not My Son.
But I Want You
To Be My Father.

7
00:00:19,988 --> 00:00:23,300
Maybe I Can Be Your Really Cool
American Uncle.

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,933
(Betty) That's Kimmie Keegan.
She Tortured Me In High School.
Aah!

9
00:00:25,966 --> 00:00:28,066
That's Your Daughter?
I Don't Hate You.

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,800
I Just Feel Like
Nothing's Ever Gonna Change.

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,628
You Just Have To Be Willing
To Do Something About It.

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,066
(Man) Forward!

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,675
(Man) Can We Get More Smoke
In Here?
(Woman) Look Up.
Look Up, Everybody.

14
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:44,066
We Need To See
Some Faces, People.

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,999
All Right,
I'm Not Loving This.
Oh, But You Promised
Zac Posen.

16
00:00:45,999 --> 00:00:48,425
I Know. We'll Give Him
A Couple Pages In Front Of Book.

17
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:50,925
One Bayonet, Please. Oh,
And I'm Worried About Shadows.

18
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:53,358
We're Gonna Lose The Helmet.
Okay.

19
00:00:57,503 --> 00:00:59,331
Great.

20
00:00:59,331 --> 00:01:00,565
I'll Go Disarm.

21
00:01:04,753 --> 00:01:07,653
Oh! Miss Meade, I've Been
Meaning To Talk To You,

22
00:01:07,687 --> 00:01:09,175
But With All The Craziness

23
00:01:09,175 --> 00:01:11,112
Of Doing These Photo Shoots
Daniel's Way

24
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,363
And Then Redoing Them
Wilhelmina's Way

25
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:15,862
And Then Back To Wil--
Betty, I Get The Pattern.

26
00:01:16,279 --> 00:01:17,612
Well...

27
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:21,987
Has Daniel Said Anything To You
About D.J. Being Gone?

28
00:01:22,878 --> 00:01:23,628
Not A Word.

29
00:01:23,628 --> 00:01:25,679
Me Neither.
I'm Worried About Him.

30
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:28,012
He's Focusing
All His Energy On Work.

31
00:01:28,045 --> 00:01:29,778
He's Totally Avoiding
His Feelings.

32
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:32,394
Well, On The Spectrum
Of Our Family's Vices,

33
00:01:32,394 --> 00:01:34,412
Work Is A Lot Healthier
Than Murder.

34
00:01:34,445 --> 00:01:36,845
Hmm. That's True.

35
00:01:37,925 --> 00:01:41,518
Betty, You Have
A Lot On Your Plate.

36
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,237
Let Me Take Care Of Daniel.

37
00:01:43,644 --> 00:01:45,862
All Right. Thanks, Guys.

38
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:49,487
(Gasps) Puppy!

39
00:01:49,487 --> 00:01:51,800
Where Did You Come From?

40
00:01:53,487 --> 00:01:56,128
What The Hell Is This?

41
00:01:56,128 --> 00:01:57,441
(Daniel)
Love Is A Battlefield.

42
00:01:57,441 --> 00:01:59,987
It's The Center Spread
For Our Valentine's Issue.

43
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:01,925
I Thought
We Were Doing Puppy Love.

44
00:02:01,925 --> 00:02:04,675
No, You Were Doing Puppy Love.
I Didn't Like It.

45
00:02:04,675 --> 00:02:08,565
Go Ahead. We Can Start.
Oh, Because Nothing Says Romance
Like Missing Limbs.

46
00:02:08,565 --> 00:02:10,425
I'm On With The P.E.T.A. People
About The Coat.

47
00:02:10,425 --> 00:02:14,847
They're In An Uproar Because
You're Wearing Dalmatian.
Oh, For God Sakes,
It's Not Real Dog.

48
00:02:14,847 --> 00:02:17,999
It's Rare Albino Leopard.
It's Rare Albino Leopard.

49
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:20,441
Get The Kids And The Puppies
And Lose Those Soldiers.
Yeah. Apparently.

50
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:23,128
No, I Am Not Letting You
Walk All Over Me.

51
00:02:23,128 --> 00:02:26,191
This Is The Shoot I Want To Do.
Kill The Puppies.

52
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,191
(Betty And Marc Gasp)
Did You Hear That?

53
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:32,425
Daniel Meade Kills Puppies.
Wilhelmina Slater
Does Not Support Our Troops.

54
00:02:32,425 --> 00:02:34,613
And Here Comes
The Editor-In-Chief Argument.

55
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,999
In Case You've Forgotten,
I Am The Editor-In-Chief

56
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:40,363
Of This Magazine.
In Case You've Forgotten,
I'm The Editor-In-Chief, Too.

57
00:02:40,363 --> 00:02:43,675
Oh, Daniel! Every Time,
For 20 Years...
I'm Not Gonna Do This
With You.

58
00:02:43,675 --> 00:02:45,050
I Want You To Leave My Set.
I've Worked On This.

59
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,800
I Have Brought
This Magazine Up--
This Is My Set, Wilhelmina.

60
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
<I>Okay, I Am Not
The Editor-In-Chief

61
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,175
Of This Magazine,
But <I>This Is A Disaster.

62
00:03:03,128 --> 00:03:04,425
This Is About
Setting Precedent.

63
00:03:04,425 --> 00:03:05,518
Alexis Is Gone.

64
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,488
Wilhelmina And I
Share Power 50/50 Now.

65
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:10,503
Okay, Daniel, But Wilhelmina
Is Not Going To Budge,

66
00:03:10,503 --> 00:03:11,675
And Neither Are You,

67
00:03:11,675 --> 00:03:13,613
Which Means We Have To Do
Everything Twice,

68
00:03:13,613 --> 00:03:16,050
But Nothing Is
Actually Getting Done.

69
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,816
And Hey, Look,
I-I Hate To Complain,

70
00:03:18,816 --> 00:03:21,300
But This Is Just More Work
Than I Can Handle.

71
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,878
So What, I Should Roll Over
To Make Your Life Easier?

72
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:25,999
<I>No, And I'm Not Loving
The Attitude, By The Way.

73
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:29,612
I'm Just Saying
Something Has To Change.

74
00:03:31,113 --> 00:03:32,237
Well...

75
00:03:32,722 --> 00:03:33,925
I'm Bored.

76
00:03:33,925 --> 00:03:35,440
I'm In A Rush.

77
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,175
See, This Is A Perfectly Hideous
Outfit You're Wearing,

78
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:39,425
But I've Already Mocked It.

79
00:03:39,425 --> 00:03:41,691
Where Am I Supposed To Find
Job Satisfaction?

80
00:03:41,691 --> 00:03:43,487
I Don't Know.
Maybe Your Job.

81
00:03:43,487 --> 00:03:46,550
Ugh. There's Something
At Your Desk.

82
00:03:49,112 --> 00:03:49,862
Hello?

83
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,112
Betty.

84
00:03:52,534 --> 00:03:54,175
Thank God You're Here.

85
00:03:54,175 --> 00:03:56,925
Kimmie?
I Really Need Your Help.

86
00:03:56,925 --> 00:03:58,550
Remember When You Came
To Flushing Burger

87
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:01,238
And Gave Me That Speech About
How I Could Do Better?
Uh-Huh.

88
00:04:01,238 --> 00:04:03,628
Well, Turns Out I Can't.

89
00:04:03,628 --> 00:04:05,988
I Quit My Job,
And No One Wants To Hire Me.

90
00:04:05,988 --> 00:04:07,253
My Boyfriend That I Hate--

91
00:04:07,253 --> 00:04:09,999
He Cheated On Me
With My Ex-Stepsister.

92
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,999
And I'm Having Pains
In My Large Joints.

93
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:13,925
I Mean, Do You Think
My Lyme Disease Is Coming Back?

94
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,331
I-I Don't Know.

95
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,300
Look, I Would Love
To Blame This All On You,

96
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,488
Really, I Would,
But Truth Is, My Life Has Been

97
00:04:23,488 --> 00:04:26,363
A Downhill Slide Into Suck
Since High School.

98
00:04:26,363 --> 00:04:28,175
I Mean, Back Then,
People Would Applaud For Me

99
00:04:28,175 --> 00:04:29,050
When I Walked Into A Room,
Betty,

100
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,675
And What If
That Doesn't Happen Anymore?

101
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,550
You Get Used To It.

102
00:04:34,488 --> 00:04:37,315
The Thing Is, You Seem To Have
Everything So Together,

103
00:04:37,315 --> 00:04:39,128
And--And I Thought

104
00:04:39,128 --> 00:04:41,050
Maybe You Could Help Me
Turn Things Around

105
00:04:41,578 --> 00:04:43,113
By Getting Me A Job Here.

106
00:04:47,566 --> 00:04:49,999
Um, Gosh, Kimmie...

107
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:53,143
I Would Really,
Really Like To Help You.

108
00:04:53,143 --> 00:04:57,300
It's Just, You Know,There Aren't Really Any
Openings Here And...

109
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,300
Sorry.

110
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,800
Betty, You Know, I Was Thinking
About What You Said Earlier.

111
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,378
Things Really Are Crazy Here.

112
00:05:01,378 --> 00:05:03,988
Why Don't You Get A Temp
To Help You Out?
Uh, That's Not Necessary.

113
00:05:03,988 --> 00:05:06,113
Oh, My God. Hi. I'm Betty's
Friend From High School,

114
00:05:06,113 --> 00:05:08,925
And We Were Just Talking About
How I Should Maybe Work Here.

115
00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:10,800
Perfect Timing.
Welcome To "Mode."

116
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,675
Yes! Yes!

117
00:05:19,675 --> 00:05:21,112
I'm In Hell.

118
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,613
Oh, Is She Really That Bad?

119
00:05:23,613 --> 00:05:25,612
You Have No Idea.

120
00:05:25,612 --> 00:05:28,237
When We Were In Junior High,
She Had The Entire Student Body

121
00:05:28,237 --> 00:05:29,675
Calling Me...
(Whispers) "Pig Latin."
(Laughs)

122
00:05:31,175 --> 00:05:33,503
(Normal Voice) Hey!
Oh, Come On. I've Had
An Awful Lot Of Trauma.

123
00:05:33,503 --> 00:05:35,300
For God Sake,
Let Me Have My Laugh.

124
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,266
How Is Stuart Anyway?
Oh, Perfectly Fine

125
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,925
Until He Doesn't Want To Do
The Dishes Or The Washing,

126
00:05:39,925 --> 00:05:43,999
And Then It's All,
"Oh, I'm Dying. I'm Dying."
Christina.

127
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:47,878
Oh. We've Decided To Act
Like Everything's Normal.

128
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:50,988
It's The Only Way
To Not Go Crazy.

129
00:05:51,503 --> 00:05:55,425
So Come On. Finish Telling Me
About The Hateful Hellion.

130
00:05:55,425 --> 00:05:58,175
Well, I Finally Make It
To High School.

131
00:05:58,175 --> 00:06:00,269
<I>It's My Chance
<I>At A Fresh Start,

132
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:01,816
<I>But Kimmie Is There, Too.

133
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,899
Hi, Kimmie.

134
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:12,433
I Was Thinking,
Since We're Both New Here

135
00:06:12,466 --> 00:06:14,487
And We Don't Know Anyone Else,

136
00:06:14,487 --> 00:06:18,378
Maybe We Could Sit Together?

137
00:06:19,425 --> 00:06:20,612
Fine.

138
00:06:21,237 --> 00:06:22,050
Really?

139
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,378
Oh, My God. Okay, Great.
(Girls Laughing)

140
00:06:26,675 --> 00:06:28,253
Wait. Since You're Up Already,

141
00:06:28,253 --> 00:06:29,925
Would You Mind
Getting Me A Water?

142
00:06:31,062 --> 00:06:33,393
Of Course. No Problem-O.

143
00:06:44,378 --> 00:06:46,488
You've Got Something
On Your Skirt.
Hmm?

144
00:06:46,488 --> 00:06:48,269
You've Got Something
On Your Skirt.

145
00:07:01,362 --> 00:07:03,550
<I>And That's Why For Four Years,

146
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,300
<I>They Called Me "Granny Pants."

147
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,613
Christina,
I Have Worked Too Hard

148
00:07:09,613 --> 00:07:13,112
Just To Get The People At "Mode"
To <I>Almost Not Hate Me.

149
00:07:13,112 --> 00:07:14,800
I Don't Want Her To Ruin That.

150
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,425
I Know, But You've Got
All The Power Now,

151
00:07:16,425 --> 00:07:19,628
And Now It's Your Turn
To Make Her Life A Misery.

152
00:07:19,628 --> 00:07:21,237
I Don't Know About That.

153
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,800
It's Called Karma...
Granny Pants.

154
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,113
Yeah, Okay,
Let's Not Make That A Thing.

155
00:07:29,956 --> 00:07:31,581
That Was A Secret.

156
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:34,238
(School Bell Rings)
So Apparently Another
Billy Elliot's Voice

157
00:07:34,238 --> 00:07:35,269
Started To Change,

158
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:37,628
And They're Casting
For Three New Kids.

159
00:07:37,628 --> 00:07:39,800
Mrs. Read's Gonna Recommend Me
For The Audition.

160
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,628
Wait. You're Auditioning For
"Billy Elliot" On Broadway?

161
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,691
Yeah. I Mean,
A Blue-Collar British Kid

162
00:07:45,691 --> 00:07:47,347
From A Coal-Mining Town
With A Flair For Dance?

163
00:07:47,347 --> 00:07:49,113
It's Like
It Was Written For Me.

164
00:07:49,113 --> 00:07:50,925
She's Gonna Call Me Tonight
And Let Me Know.

165
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,050
Oops.

166
00:07:53,488 --> 00:07:54,613
Loser.

167
00:07:55,863 --> 00:07:57,238
(Boy Snickers)
Too Easy.

168
00:07:57,238 --> 00:07:59,175
I Am Sure This Happened
To Patti Lupone.

169
00:07:59,175 --> 00:08:01,315
He's Just
A Stupid Jock.

170
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,550
Daniel Was Adamant.
He Wants The One On The Left.

171
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,999
But They Are
Exactly The Same.

172
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:09,644
No, Wilhelmina Wants
The One On The Right.

173
00:08:09,644 --> 00:08:11,268
Welcome To My World.

174
00:08:12,363 --> 00:08:14,112
I Got Most Of Your Receipts,

175
00:08:14,112 --> 00:08:15,738
But <I>Wilmemina
Wasn't In Her Office.

176
00:08:15,738 --> 00:08:18,768
Great.
Oh, There She Is.

177
00:08:18,768 --> 00:08:20,175
Oh, You Really Shouldn't...

178
00:08:22,237 --> 00:08:25,488
<I>It's Your Turn
<I>To Make Her Life A Misery.

179
00:08:26,438 --> 00:08:28,565
Wait Too Long.

180
00:08:28,565 --> 00:08:30,237
We Really Need Them.

181
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:36,112
Hey,Wilmemina,I Have
To Get Your Receipts.

182
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,362
Oh, My God.
I Have That Same Jacket,

183
00:08:38,362 --> 00:08:41,050
Except I Got Mine
At A Discount Store For 60% Off,

184
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,999
And You Can't Even See
The Hole Under The Armpit.

185
00:08:43,488 --> 00:08:44,784
Marc?

186
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,300
Scat!

187
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,425
<I>Wilmemina? 60% Off?
I'm So, So Sorry.
That Will Never Happen Again.

188
00:08:53,425 --> 00:08:54,253
Why Is She
Even Talking To Me?
Never.

189
00:08:54,253 --> 00:08:59,113
I Know It's Mean,
But... It Kind Of Felt Good.

190
00:08:59,113 --> 00:09:01,707
That Bitch
Got What She Deserved.

191
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,613
And If The Tables Were Turned,

192
00:09:03,613 --> 00:09:06,300
She Would Have Done
Something Way Worse To Me.

193
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,628
Tie That Skank To A Lamppost
And Let Her Rot.

194
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,175
Um... Okay.
What's Going On With You?

195
00:09:15,175 --> 00:09:16,999
Oh, I'm Trying Not To Be Sad
About Coach,

196
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:18,753
So I'm Choosing Anger.

197
00:09:19,862 --> 00:09:21,847
It's A Great Release.
Aah!

198
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:25,237
Yeah, She's Been A Delight.

199
00:09:25,487 --> 00:09:29,675
You Know, Have You Ever Thought
About <I>Helping Kimmie Out?

200
00:09:30,128 --> 00:09:31,925
Dad, How Could You Say That?

201
00:09:31,925 --> 00:09:34,612
She Was Terrible To You
At Flushing Burger.

202
00:09:34,612 --> 00:09:37,581
I Would Totally Get Revenge
On My Bullies If I Could.

203
00:09:37,581 --> 00:09:40,175
Wait A Minute.
You Have Bullies?

204
00:09:40,175 --> 00:09:41,878
Why Didn't I Know About This?
It's Nothing.

205
00:09:41,878 --> 00:09:44,987
Well, It's Gonna Be Something
When I Go Down There

206
00:09:44,987 --> 00:09:47,800
And I Kick Their Asses.
We're Talking About Betty.
Betty.

207
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,128
I Don't Understand Why I
Have To Be The Bigger Person.

208
00:09:50,128 --> 00:09:52,675
I Mean, When I Started
At "Mode," No One Helped Me.

209
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,175
And Did You Like It?

210
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,175
No, But I Dealt With It,

211
00:09:57,175 --> 00:09:59,613
Because That Is A Part
Of Growing Up.

212
00:09:59,613 --> 00:10:02,988
What?
So Is Putting The Past
Behind You.

213
00:10:02,988 --> 00:10:04,628
If You Give Kimmie A Chance,

214
00:10:04,628 --> 00:10:06,988
Maybe You'll Find You're
Not As Different As You Think.

215
00:10:10,753 --> 00:10:13,113
What If We "Accidentally" Shaved
Half Of Betty's Head

216
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:16,738
While She Slept? That'd Be
Something New To Mock.
It's Funny, But It Seems
Like A Lot Of Work.

217
00:10:16,738 --> 00:10:18,456
Yeah, And She Might Actually
Look Better. (Laughs)
(Laughs)

218
00:10:20,347 --> 00:10:21,862
(Gasps) Temp.
(Gasps) Temp.

219
00:10:22,062 --> 00:10:23,628
Oh, My God.

220
00:10:23,628 --> 00:10:25,878
It's An Achy Breaky Tart.

221
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,128
Hey.
Hey.

222
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,566
(Gasps)
Cute Tiny Backpack.

223
00:10:31,566 --> 00:10:34,487
Do You Put All Your
Tiny Scrunchies In It?
I Do.

224
00:10:34,487 --> 00:10:38,128
Oh, It's So Dope,
Not '90s At All.

225
00:10:38,128 --> 00:10:39,863
Oh, Great,
Because I Was Worried.

226
00:10:39,863 --> 00:10:41,425
You Know, I-I Haven't Bought
New Clothes Since High School.

227
00:10:41,425 --> 00:10:46,238
In My Old Job,
We Used To Have Uniforms.
N.I.

228
00:10:48,675 --> 00:10:50,675
I Love My Job.

229
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:52,363
(Wilhelmina) Okay, People.

230
00:10:52,363 --> 00:10:54,675
We Still Don't Have
A Center Spread.

231
00:10:54,675 --> 00:10:56,362
We Have A Lot Work Coming Up.
Whoa!

232
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,378
(Easel Thuds)
Oh! Sorry!

233
00:11:03,675 --> 00:11:04,863
Kimmie...

234
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,503
(Whispers) Why Don't You Go
Get Some Waters For The Room?

235
00:11:07,503 --> 00:11:08,690
(Whispers) Okay.
Okay.

236
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,800
Wow. Throw A Poncho
And Sideburns On That Girl,

237
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,112
She Could Be You, Betty.
Well, For Our First
New Order Of Business,

238
00:11:16,112 --> 00:11:17,503
Fire That Train Wreck.
(Thud)

239
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,565
Okay, Stop!
(Gasps)

240
00:11:28,951 --> 00:11:33,675
Look, Sometimes When People Walk
In Here, They Get Nervous

241
00:11:33,675 --> 00:11:36,284
And They Don't Do So Well
On Their First Day

242
00:11:36,284 --> 00:11:39,238
Or Maybe They Make Regrettable
Wardrobe Decisions

243
00:11:39,238 --> 00:11:42,738
That They Can Never Live Down.
Betty,
I Know She's Your Friend,

244
00:11:42,738 --> 00:11:44,440
But You're The One Who's
Gonna Have To Pick Up The Slack

245
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,175
If She Can't Cut It.
Well, It Won't Happen.

246
00:11:49,612 --> 00:11:52,238
I'm Gonna Turn Her
Into The Perfect Assistant.

250
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:14,487
Working At "Mode"
Is Intimidating,

251
00:12:14,487 --> 00:12:16,988
So I've Created An Acronym
To Help You Remember

252
00:12:16,988 --> 00:12:20,237
The Three Most Important
Things--A.R.G. "Arg."

253
00:12:20,237 --> 00:12:22,238
Let's Start With "A"--
Anticipate.

254
00:12:22,238 --> 00:12:24,300
Know What People Need
Before They Do.
How Do You Know What They--

255
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,425
I Anticipated
You Were Gonna Ask That.
Wow. You're Good.

256
00:12:27,425 --> 00:12:29,565
I Know.
Then There's "R"--Research.

257
00:12:29,565 --> 00:12:32,566
Read Everything, Listen
To Everything, Know Everything.
Everything?

258
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:34,378
Did I Not Just Say Everything
Three Times?

259
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,738
For Example, Yesterday
You Needed To Know

260
00:12:36,738 --> 00:12:37,925
That If You Need
Wilhelmina's Receipts,

261
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:40,691
You Never Ask Her For Them.
But You Told Me To.

262
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:42,894
Another Lesson--Be Careful
Who You Listen To.

263
00:12:42,894 --> 00:12:44,999
But Back To Wilhelmina.
Avoidance Is Key.

264
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:48,129
If You Screw Up With Her,
You're Fired Or You Could Die.

265
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:49,050
There Have Been Rumors.

266
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,999
If You Need Something,
This Is What You Do.

267
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:53,050
Wow. It's Too Bad
Daniel Can't Go To The Premiere

268
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,254
For That New Colin Farrell
Movie.
Colin Farrell?

269
00:12:56,254 --> 00:12:58,925
Oh, That's Right.
Amanda Mentioned You Liked Him.

270
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:00,675
What Do You Want?
Wilhelmina's September Receipts.

271
00:13:00,675 --> 00:13:01,941
Do I Get A Guest?
If You Promise Me October.

272
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:05,487
All Right, On Your Desk
In An Hour.
And That's "G"--Gumption.

273
00:13:05,487 --> 00:13:08,800
Wow. This Is Harder
Than I Thought.
Well, Take A Deep Breath Because
We're Just Getting Started.

274
00:13:14,738 --> 00:13:17,550
Try Again. Wilhelmina.

275
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,863
Wilmemina.

276
00:13:19,441 --> 00:13:22,175
Wil-Hel-Mina.

277
00:13:22,175 --> 00:13:23,222
Wilmemina.

278
00:13:23,222 --> 00:13:24,753
* I'm Not Containable

279
00:13:24,753 --> 00:13:29,409
* I Ain't Freakin',
I Ain't Fakin' This *

280
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,999
Okay, Take It By The Handle
And Press That Button.

281
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:36,222
Wil-Ah-Mina.

282
00:13:36,222 --> 00:13:37,425
Wil-Mel-Mina.

283
00:13:37,425 --> 00:13:40,050
Okay, There's An Easy Way
To Remember This.

284
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,925
There's "Hell" In It.

285
00:13:41,925 --> 00:13:44,879
Hell-Me-Mina.
What Is Wrong With You?

286
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:46,550
Maybe This Was A Big Mistake.

287
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,691
No, No, No, No, No, No.
It's Not A Big Mistake.

288
00:13:49,691 --> 00:13:53,519
Look, I Know That
These Past Couple Of Years

289
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,316
Have Been Really Rough
On You,

290
00:13:55,316 --> 00:13:58,269
But You're Kimmie Keegan.

291
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:00,800
You Were Homecoming Queen

292
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,487
And Prom Queen

293
00:14:02,487 --> 00:14:04,925
And President
Of The Senior Class

294
00:14:04,925 --> 00:14:06,925
And A Cheerleader.

295
00:14:06,925 --> 00:14:07,925
Head Cheerleader.

296
00:14:07,925 --> 00:14:10,175
Head Cheerleader. See?

297
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,738
Now You Just Gotta
Find That Confidence

298
00:14:12,738 --> 00:14:14,331
That You Had In High School.

299
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:19,050
Two, Four, Six, Eight.

300
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,566
Kimmie Keegan
Used To Be Great?

301
00:14:22,925 --> 00:14:24,112
That's A Start.

302
00:14:24,988 --> 00:14:27,707
You Are Really Stepping Up.

303
00:14:27,707 --> 00:14:31,988
Oh-Ho, That Look
On Wilhelmina's Stretched Face

304
00:14:31,988 --> 00:14:35,237
When You Refused To Give In
To Her Shoot Was Priceless.

305
00:14:35,237 --> 00:14:37,550
Since When Do You Eat
Kids' Cereal?

306
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,300
D.J. Turned Me On To It.

307
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,378
It Turns The Milk Blue.

308
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,987
Oh, I Also Found Some Of D.J.'S
Things Around The House--

309
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,925
Baseball Cards...

310
00:14:50,175 --> 00:14:53,190
(Scoffs)
Lingerie Catalogue...

311
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,206
Oh, And Something Called

312
00:14:54,206 --> 00:14:56,925
"Street Wars Five:
Revenge Of The Pimps."

313
00:14:56,925 --> 00:14:58,925
Actually, That's Mine.

314
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,487
I Know
What You're Trying To Do.

315
00:15:03,518 --> 00:15:04,644
I Don't Want To Talk About It.

316
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,800
Just Having My Morning Bowl
Of Marshmallows.

317
00:15:10,487 --> 00:15:11,940
What Do You Want Me To Say?

318
00:15:12,735 --> 00:15:13,738
I Miss Him.

319
00:15:14,237 --> 00:15:18,347
When He Was Here,
I Had M-More Balance.

320
00:15:20,113 --> 00:15:21,237
It's Like...

321
00:15:22,175 --> 00:15:23,816
The Stupid Things
Didn't Matter Anymore.

322
00:15:23,816 --> 00:15:25,941
Now All I Have
Are The Stupid Things.

323
00:15:25,941 --> 00:15:28,050
I-I Just--I...

324
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:30,269
You Just What?

325
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:32,675
I Want A Family, Mom.

326
00:15:32,675 --> 00:15:35,487
Well, That's Wonderful.

327
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,925
I Guess.

328
00:15:38,472 --> 00:15:40,315
But What Am I Supposed
To Do About It?

329
00:15:40,425 --> 00:15:43,144
The Women I've Been Meeting
Aren't Exactly Life Mates.

330
00:15:43,144 --> 00:15:45,113
I Mean, My Clock Is Ticking.

331
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:50,612
Your Father Conceived A Child
After He Was Dead.

332
00:15:50,612 --> 00:15:52,425
You'll Be Fine.

333
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,831
Very Good.
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, It's Good,

334
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:08,972
But You're Still
Popping Your Hip.
Hilda.

335
00:16:08,972 --> 00:16:13,175
I Saw "A Chorus Line," Okay?
Okay, Mom?

336
00:16:13,175 --> 00:16:16,315
Mom, I'm Going To Get
Some Water.

337
00:16:16,315 --> 00:16:18,425
Okay,
But Don't Think That Means

338
00:16:18,425 --> 00:16:20,487
You Get An Automatic
Bathroom Break In An Hour.

339
00:16:20,487 --> 00:16:22,628
You're Riding Him Pretty Hard,
Don't You Think?

340
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:24,878
Maybe It's Time For You
To Be Done With The Anger Phase.

341
00:16:24,878 --> 00:16:27,175
No, No, No. It's Not Anger.

342
00:16:27,175 --> 00:16:30,238
It's Just...
I Really Want Him To Get This.

343
00:16:30,238 --> 00:16:32,737
He's Having A Hard Time
At School Lately.
Really?

344
00:16:32,737 --> 00:16:34,925
Yeah. You Heard Him
Talking About The Bullies.

345
00:16:34,925 --> 00:16:38,738
Yeah, But I Didn't Think
It Was Serious.
He Downplays It,

346
00:16:38,738 --> 00:16:42,050
But I Just Want Him To Have
A Place Where He Fits In.

347
00:16:43,938 --> 00:16:45,362
Okay. I'm Ready.

348
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,316
From The Top.
Five, Six, Seven, Eight.

349
00:16:51,425 --> 00:16:55,175
Hey. So I Noticed Daniel's
Cuticles Were A Little Rough.

350
00:16:55,175 --> 00:16:57,315
I Heard The Beauty Editor
Talking About This New Spa

351
00:16:57,315 --> 00:16:59,378
Where They Soak Your Fingers
In Organic Olive Oil.

352
00:16:59,378 --> 00:17:01,612
They Told Me No Openings
Till March.

353
00:17:01,612 --> 00:17:04,394
I Told <I>Them
No "Editor's Pick" In "Mode."

354
00:17:04,394 --> 00:17:05,737
Daniel Has An Appointment
For Friday.

355
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,425
Well...

356
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:13,331
You Anticipated, Did Research
And Showed Gumption. Arg.

357
00:17:13,331 --> 00:17:14,863
Arg.

358
00:17:14,863 --> 00:17:16,862
You've Been So Amazing To Me.

359
00:17:16,862 --> 00:17:18,378
I Have To Find A Way
To Thank You.
Oh, It's Not Necessary.

360
00:17:18,378 --> 00:17:21,112
Let's Go Out Tonight.
Really?

361
00:17:21,112 --> 00:17:22,613
I Was Updating
Daniel's Contacts,

362
00:17:22,613 --> 00:17:24,612
And I Got Us
Into All The Hot Clubs.

363
00:17:24,612 --> 00:17:26,113
I've Tried To Get In Before,

364
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:28,425
But It's Like They Could Smell
The Bridge And Tunnel On Me.

365
00:17:28,425 --> 00:17:31,362
But Tonight You And Me
Are V.I.P.

366
00:17:31,362 --> 00:17:32,331
I'm So Glad
We're Becoming Friends.

367
00:17:35,316 --> 00:17:36,738
Me, Too.

368
00:17:38,828 --> 00:17:40,597
Could You Proof This?
Sure.

369
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:45,300
Is This An Application
For A Dating Service?

370
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,987
Actually, It's A Discreet,

371
00:17:46,987 --> 00:17:48,815
High-End
Matchmaking Organization.

372
00:17:48,815 --> 00:17:51,738
I Thought It's Time I Got
Serious About Meeting Someone.

373
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,988
And Since
The Last Woman I Picked

374
00:17:53,988 --> 00:17:55,378
Ended Up
Burning My House Down,

375
00:17:55,378 --> 00:17:56,862
I Thought I'd Trust
The Professionals.

376
00:17:56,862 --> 00:18:01,175
That's Wonderful.
Okay, You're Not This Tall.

377
00:18:01,175 --> 00:18:03,457
Depends On The Shoe.
Keep Reading.

378
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,190
"Likes--Sports..." Mm-Hmm.

379
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,738
"Women..." Mm-Hmm.

380
00:18:07,738 --> 00:18:09,238
"Yoga"?

381
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:10,675
Yeah, I Took A Class.

382
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,878
Right. "Walks At Sunset
And Myself."

383
00:18:15,878 --> 00:18:18,831
Well, I Thought It Shows
Healthy Self-Esteem.

384
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,425
Why Don't I Just Take
A Quick Pass At This?

385
00:18:21,425 --> 00:18:22,753
Oh, Oh, By The Way,

386
00:18:22,753 --> 00:18:25,738
Do You Think We're Gonna
Be Working Late Tonight?
Uh, Probably Not.

387
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:26,999
Good.

388
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,800
Don't You Want To Know
What I'm Doing?

389
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,363
What Are You Doing, Betty?

390
00:18:32,363 --> 00:18:34,550
I'm Going Clubbing
With Kimmie Keegan. Yeah!

391
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,816
Betty Suarez Is Going Clubbing
With Kimmie Keegan.

392
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:38,925
Fun.

393
00:18:38,925 --> 00:18:41,534
No, You Have No Idea
What A Big Deal This Is.

394
00:18:41,534 --> 00:18:44,550
In High School, She Wouldn't
Even Give Me The Time Of Day.

395
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:49,581
And Now, I Mean, I Really
Like Her, And She Likes Me.

396
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:52,644
You Know, It Just Goes To Show,
You Can Get Over Your Past,

397
00:18:52,644 --> 00:18:54,347
Which Is A Great Lesson
For You And Wilhelmina.
Go.

398
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,050
Going.

399
00:18:59,313 --> 00:19:00,753
I Noticed You Like
A Sugar Fix After Lunch,

400
00:19:00,753 --> 00:19:02,440
So I Brought You A Cookie.

401
00:19:06,988 --> 00:19:08,800
You're Pretty.
I Just Assumed You Weren't

402
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,878
Because You're A Friend
Of Betty's.
Oh, Betty's The Best,
Isn't She?

403
00:19:11,878 --> 00:19:14,237
I Mean, She Taught Me
Everything About This Place.

404
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:17,815
I Can--I Can Collate, I Can
Reduce, I Can Do Double-Sided.

405
00:19:17,815 --> 00:19:19,675
I Officially Rock
The Copy Room.

406
00:19:19,675 --> 00:19:23,456
Okay, I Don't Know
Where This Copy Room Is.

407
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,378
Look, Knowing Stuff Is Fine
For Girls Like Betty,

408
00:19:27,378 --> 00:19:29,362
Who Don't Have Their Looks
To Skate By On,

409
00:19:29,362 --> 00:19:32,362
But I Can Show You
What's Really Important.

410
00:19:41,878 --> 00:19:43,238
No.

411
00:19:48,425 --> 00:19:51,222
Can You Believe This?
It's So Exciting.

412
00:19:51,222 --> 00:19:52,488
My Baby's On Broadway.

413
00:19:52,488 --> 00:19:54,941
Okay, Ready? Smile.

414
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,300
(Scoffs) Mom.

415
00:19:59,362 --> 00:20:01,738
Okay, I'm Gonna Go Sign In.

416
00:20:01,738 --> 00:20:04,487
Okay. Good Luck. Hi.
(Whispers)
Sit Down. Sit Down.

417
00:20:09,503 --> 00:20:10,925
What Are You Doing Here?

418
00:20:10,925 --> 00:20:13,612
What? I Thought I'd Give
The Acting Thing A Try.

419
00:20:15,312 --> 00:20:15,425
(Scoffs) Whatever.

420
00:20:15,425 --> 00:20:17,910
My Mom Said I Could Only
Play Football If I Did This.

421
00:20:20,441 --> 00:20:22,737
(Woman) "A" Through "M,"
Over Here.

422
00:20:22,737 --> 00:20:24,675
Checking Out
The Competition?

423
00:20:24,675 --> 00:20:26,269
He Goes To My School.

424
00:20:26,269 --> 00:20:28,863
Trust Me.
That Guy's No <I>Competish.

425
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:32,691
They're Sending You
On A Dinner Cruise

426
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:34,800
Around The Harbor
So You Can Get To Know Her.

427
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,253
I Still Can't Believe
They Found Someone That Fast.

428
00:20:37,253 --> 00:20:39,862
I Kind Of Wish I Had Time
For That Olive Oil Manicure.

429
00:20:39,862 --> 00:20:42,113
Right. Well, Here's A Copy
Of Her Profile--

430
00:20:42,113 --> 00:20:44,175
Number 4-9-5-2-4.

431
00:20:44,175 --> 00:20:47,675
She Is Smart, A Former Model,
Loves Her Job

432
00:20:47,675 --> 00:20:49,237
And Her Idea Of A Perfect Day

433
00:20:49,237 --> 00:20:52,190
Is A Picnic In The Park
With Children.

434
00:20:54,266 --> 00:20:55,563
She Sounds Perfect.

435
00:20:55,613 --> 00:20:57,816
She'll Think
You're Perfect, Too.

436
00:21:01,488 --> 00:21:03,379
Oh, Maybe Do
Another Button.

437
00:21:05,312 --> 00:21:06,300
The Other Way.

438
00:21:36,063 --> 00:21:37,987
Ta-Da!

439
00:21:37,987 --> 00:21:40,816
Kimmie, Hi.

440
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:42,050
You Look So...

441
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:42,999
I Know, Right?

442
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:45,550
Amanda Took Me To The Closet
And Hair And Makeup.

443
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,112
I Mean, I Can't Believe
We Can Just Use Those Things

444
00:21:47,112 --> 00:21:51,175
Whenever We Want.
We Can't. Amanda Just Tends
To Make Up Her Own Rules.

445
00:21:51,175 --> 00:21:54,831
Oh, Got It. Unfortunately,
I Was Talking To Amanda

446
00:21:54,831 --> 00:21:55,863
About Us
Going Clubbing Tonight,

447
00:21:55,863 --> 00:21:57,441
And She Said It Would
Be Way More Fun

448
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:01,237
If Her And Marc Came, Too.
No! It--It Wouldn't.

449
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,331
Okay, I Mean, I-I--
What Was I Supposed To Do?

450
00:22:03,331 --> 00:22:06,628
I Had To Invite Them.
But Tonight Is About You And Me.

451
00:22:06,628 --> 00:22:08,487
So Don't Worry.
We'll Totally Ignore Them.

452
00:22:11,953 --> 00:22:13,675
What Are You Guys
Talking About?

453
00:22:16,687 --> 00:22:18,300
Okay, Does It--
Can I Open This?

454
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,425
No, Too Dangerous.
But I Know Them.

455
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:24,190
One Time I Let My Girlfriend
Open It. She Was Shot.

456
00:22:24,687 --> 00:22:25,800
Oh, My God.

457
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,175
On The Plus Side, I'm Single.

458
00:22:30,925 --> 00:22:32,863
What Are You Laughing About?

459
00:22:32,863 --> 00:22:34,566
What's--What's So Funny?

460
00:22:35,238 --> 00:22:36,999
It's Too Hard To Explain.

461
00:22:38,453 --> 00:22:41,378
You Could Try.
No, I Won't, I Won't.

462
00:22:41,378 --> 00:22:43,300
You Could Try.
(Amanda) I Can't Even
Explain It Like That.

463
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:47,988
I'm Pretty Smart.
You Know, You're Not Part
Of Their Group.

464
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,050
Yes, I Am.

465
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,628
Oh, My God.
We Are Totally Here.

466
00:22:53,925 --> 00:22:54,503
Guys.

467
00:22:54,503 --> 00:22:56,999
Guys, We Have To Pay.

468
00:23:06,487 --> 00:23:11,300
Mr. Meade, Welcome.
I'm Harmony.

469
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,191
Appropriate, Right?
Totally My Real Name.

470
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:14,987
But You Are Not Here
To Talk To Me.

471
00:23:14,987 --> 00:23:17,925
Your Date Is
Right Over There.

472
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,612
Thank You.

473
00:23:29,347 --> 00:23:33,613
You Must Be 4-9-5-2-4.

474
00:23:38,238 --> 00:23:41,675
Your Ideal Day Is A Picnic
In The Park With The Kids?

475
00:23:41,675 --> 00:23:43,785
6'4"?

476
00:23:43,785 --> 00:23:46,999
I'm Leaving.
No, <I>I'm Leaving.
You're Not Walking Out On Me.

477
00:23:49,878 --> 00:23:52,999
(Daniel) Wait. Wait,
Wait, Wait. No. Stop The Boat.

478
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:54,999
Oh!
You Have Got To Be Kidding.

479
00:23:57,784 --> 00:23:59,691
(Betty) Excuse Me. Sorry.
Gotta Get To The Front.

480
00:23:59,691 --> 00:24:01,675
Betty, Come On.
I'm With Them.

481
00:24:01,675 --> 00:24:05,128
Sorry.
I Had To Pay The Cab.
Kimmie Keegan Plus Three.

482
00:24:05,813 --> 00:24:09,238
I've Only Got You Plus Two.
Pick Your Friends.

483
00:24:10,128 --> 00:24:12,925
Oh, Me. Me.
Me. Me. We, We, We. We.

484
00:24:12,925 --> 00:24:14,644
(Amanda) Yeah.

485
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:17,581
How About Marc,
Amanda And Me Go In

486
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,988
And See If It's
Even Worth Staying Here?

487
00:24:18,988 --> 00:24:19,894
Good-Bye.
Miss You.

488
00:24:19,894 --> 00:24:23,112
But Well--Or Maybe
Just Two Of Us Could Go In

489
00:24:23,112 --> 00:24:26,753
And Two Could Stay Out Here.
Don't Worry. If It's Cool
Then I'll Come And Get You.

490
00:24:26,753 --> 00:24:29,816
Ten Minutes.
Um, Okay.

491
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:34,815
I Guess I'll Just Wait Here.
Oh, Okay. All Right.

492
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:41,691
Why Are You
Doing This Anyway?

493
00:24:41,691 --> 00:24:44,597
Excuse Me?
There Are People Here

494
00:24:44,597 --> 00:24:45,987
Who Take This
Really Seriously,

495
00:24:45,987 --> 00:24:48,925
Like Getting This Part
Could Change Their Life.

496
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:50,863
I Don't Go Down
To The Football Field

497
00:24:50,863 --> 00:24:55,237
Because I Feel Like
Giving Ball Tossing A Try.
You're Just Mad I'm Good.

498
00:24:55,237 --> 00:24:58,737
Doubt It. <I>This Is Good...

499
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,363
That's All You Got?

500
00:25:12,488 --> 00:25:13,862
(Scoffs) Not Bad.

501
00:25:13,862 --> 00:25:15,300
All Right, But Not This...

502
00:25:24,738 --> 00:25:26,238
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.
All Right, All Right.

503
00:25:26,238 --> 00:25:29,487
Save It For The Stage, Okay?
Group Four, You're Up.

504
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:31,315
Excuse Me.
Watch It.

505
00:25:34,613 --> 00:25:35,487
Let's Go.

506
00:25:42,753 --> 00:25:44,988
Those Guys Were Really Good.

507
00:25:44,988 --> 00:25:48,315
Yeah. I Think That Short Kid
Was Actually Flying.

508
00:25:50,535 --> 00:25:53,753
So Are We Ready
To Get To Know Each Other?

509
00:25:55,425 --> 00:25:59,050
Watch It, You Two.
I'm Feeling The Tension.

510
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:07,112
What?

511
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:08,503
I Can't Believe

512
00:26:08,503 --> 00:26:11,362
Wilhelmina Slater
Uses A Dating Service.

513
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:15,113
Well, Marc Doesn't Fulfill
All Of My Needs.

514
00:26:15,113 --> 00:26:18,300
God Knows He's Given It
The Old College Try.

515
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:22,300
Well, I Guess It Just Shows You
Everyone Gets Lonely.

516
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,925
I'm Not Lonely. I'm Horny.

517
00:26:25,612 --> 00:26:28,800
Ahem. Your First Course Is
Oysters On The Half Shell.

518
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,425
They're An Aphrodisiac,

519
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:33,269
Not That You Need One.

520
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:36,237
Now Can I Bring You Two
Some Wine?

521
00:26:36,237 --> 00:26:38,191
Dear God, Yes.
Yeah. Keep It Coming.

522
00:26:48,988 --> 00:26:50,112
Hey.

523
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,863
They Went With The Short Kid.

524
00:26:53,391 --> 00:26:54,113
Come Here.

525
00:26:55,175 --> 00:26:56,300
They're Idiots.

526
00:26:56,675 --> 00:26:58,816
"Billy Elliot" Is Dead To Me.

527
00:26:58,816 --> 00:27:02,254
Yeah, Anybody Can Do
That Silly Choreography.

528
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:04,769
You--You Make It Your Own.
(Snaps Fingers)

529
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:08,813
Hey, Why Don't We Go
And Get Some Ice Cream

530
00:27:08,863 --> 00:27:10,487
To Cheer You Guys Up?

531
00:27:10,487 --> 00:27:10,999
Okay.

532
00:27:11,265 --> 00:27:12,753
I'm Gonna Get My Bag.

533
00:27:12,753 --> 00:27:13,487
Meet You Outside.

534
00:27:13,487 --> 00:27:14,394
All Right.

535
00:27:31,453 --> 00:27:32,957
Are You Okay?

536
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:34,862
Go Away.

537
00:27:37,312 --> 00:27:37,816
Could You Pass The--

538
00:27:37,816 --> 00:27:39,175
No.

539
00:27:39,563 --> 00:27:43,237
I Hope You Didn't Fill Up
Because You're Not Done Yet.

540
00:27:43,237 --> 00:27:45,394
Why?
How Many Courses Are There?
Eight.

541
00:27:46,266 --> 00:27:47,550
(Sighs)
I Know.

542
00:27:49,999 --> 00:27:51,800
I Have Got
To Get Off This Boat.

543
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,910
You Can't
Set The Boat On Fire.

544
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:05,863
Explosives Work Better,
And We Didn't Plan Ahead.

545
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:06,941
Crap.

546
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,050
Wait. Here.

547
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,613
Let Me Show You.

548
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,253
She's Coming. Come On.

549
00:28:19,722 --> 00:28:20,800
Act Casual.

550
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:26,175
Okay, Okay, Okay.

551
00:28:26,175 --> 00:28:29,722
Don't Panic. This Happens,
Like, Every Other Cruise.

552
00:28:29,722 --> 00:28:31,425
But Just As A Precaution,

553
00:28:31,425 --> 00:28:34,284
The Captain's Heading
Back To Shore.
Aw.

554
00:28:47,828 --> 00:28:49,738
Check Our Name.
(Man) Check Again.

555
00:28:49,738 --> 00:28:51,425
Taxi!

556
00:28:54,062 --> 00:28:55,675
Betty.

557
00:28:56,691 --> 00:28:58,175
I'm So Sorry
It Took So Long.

558
00:28:58,175 --> 00:29:00,112
Wait. You're Not Leaving,
Are You?

559
00:29:00,531 --> 00:29:03,800
Kimmie, I've Been Waiting
Out Here For 45 Minutes.

560
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,612
I Mean, It's Been Fun,
But I Think I've Had Enough.

561
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:09,987
But You Can't Go.
We Haven't Even Talked Yet.
(Scoffs)

562
00:29:09,987 --> 00:29:11,190
Kimmie,
I Don't Understand You.

563
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,363
One Minute You're Like,
"Hey, Let's Hang Out,"

564
00:29:13,363 --> 00:29:14,613
And The Next
You're Ditching Me

565
00:29:14,613 --> 00:29:17,999
And Sharing
"Too Hard To Explain" Jokes.

566
00:29:17,999 --> 00:29:19,612
Look, We Don't
Have To Be Friends.

567
00:29:19,612 --> 00:29:22,316
Just Don't Pretend We Are
If We're Not.

568
00:29:22,316 --> 00:29:24,612
No, No. We Are Friends.
I Swear.

569
00:29:24,612 --> 00:29:28,612
That's Why I Got Amanda And Marc
In, So We Could Ditch Them.
Really?

570
00:29:28,612 --> 00:29:30,956
Yeah, Totally.
We're Getting Out Of Here.

571
00:29:30,956 --> 00:29:32,488
I've Got Us Lined Up
For Three More Clubs

572
00:29:32,488 --> 00:29:35,925
And A Couple After Hours.
Oh, I Don't Know.

573
00:29:35,925 --> 00:29:38,050
What About Work Tomorrow?
We'll Be Exhausted.

574
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:40,613
Not If We Go In Late.
Daniel And Wilhelmina Have

575
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:42,706
A Meeting At The Design Studio
Until Noon.

576
00:29:42,706 --> 00:29:46,753
They'll Never Even Know
We're Gone. It'll Be Fun.

577
00:29:46,753 --> 00:29:49,300
Getting Into These Places
Is So New For The Both Of Us.

578
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,300
Let's Do It Together. Come On.
We're Friends, Aren't We?

579
00:29:53,062 --> 00:29:53,269
Yeah.

580
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:55,191
Let's Go.

581
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:57,112
It'll Be So Much Fun.

582
00:29:59,703 --> 00:30:00,987
I Will Never Forget.

583
00:30:00,987 --> 00:30:04,050
Nico Was 4, And I Was Leaving
For The Black And White Ball,

584
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:07,488
And She Threw Up
All Over Armani--

585
00:30:07,488 --> 00:30:10,050
The--The Man, Not The Gown.

586
00:30:11,175 --> 00:30:12,675
See, That's What I Want.

587
00:30:12,675 --> 00:30:16,550
I Mean, Not That Exactly,
But The Memories,

588
00:30:16,862 --> 00:30:17,937
The Perspective It Gives You.

589
00:30:17,987 --> 00:30:20,050
I Know You Think You Have
To Have Kids Right Away,

590
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:22,315
But 2 Months
With A 12 Year Old

591
00:30:22,315 --> 00:30:24,612
Is Not The Same
As Having A Baby.

592
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,675
I Know.
So What You Should Do

593
00:30:27,675 --> 00:30:29,878
Is Take All The Time
You Need To Prepare.

594
00:30:29,878 --> 00:30:32,440
I Mean, Lords Knows
I Screwed Up With Nico,

595
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,175
Not Being Ready.

596
00:30:34,175 --> 00:30:36,394
Well, Maybe You'll Handle Things
Differently With This Baby.

597
00:30:36,394 --> 00:30:37,987
I Hope So.

598
00:30:37,987 --> 00:30:39,250
I Mean, It Wouldn't Hurt
To Hedge My Bets

599
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,706
And Try To Find A Partner.

600
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:46,612
Well, As Much As I'm Sure
Me And The Baby And The Nanny

601
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:48,112
Will Make A Happy Household,

602
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:51,738
I... There's Room
For One More Person.

603
00:30:51,938 --> 00:30:53,362
Yeah.

604
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:58,133
So... Any Idea How The Hell
We're Gonna Handle Things

605
00:30:58,166 --> 00:31:00,133
With Both Of Us In Charge?

606
00:31:01,867 --> 00:31:02,999
Well, I Hate To Admit It,

607
00:31:02,999 --> 00:31:05,999
But We Did Make
A Good Team Tonight.
(Laughs) Yeah.

608
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:09,737
Maybe, Um, We Should Start
Trusting Each Other.

609
00:31:11,063 --> 00:31:11,800
No Offense,

610
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,300
But I'd Say Trusting You Would
Be Making A Rookie Mistake.

611
00:31:16,578 --> 00:31:17,737
Touch?

612
00:31:18,188 --> 00:31:21,815
Perhaps We All Have
Our Pasts To Overcome.

613
00:31:22,062 --> 00:31:23,987
But Maybe With Time,

614
00:31:23,987 --> 00:31:27,300
You'll See That I Can Change.

615
00:31:29,937 --> 00:31:31,999
Wait.
That's Not Your Building.

616
00:31:32,487 --> 00:31:36,050
Um, I Called A "Buddy."

617
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:38,612
While I Certainly Have
Long-Term Goals,

618
00:31:38,612 --> 00:31:40,582
I Also Have Short-Term Needs.

619
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:06,956
H... (Clears Throat, Coughs)
Hello?

620
00:32:06,956 --> 00:32:09,190
Betty, Is Everything Okay?

621
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:11,237
Daniel, What Time Is It?

622
00:32:11,237 --> 00:32:13,238
Uh, 10:00.
My Meeting Canceled.
(Gasps)

623
00:32:13,238 --> 00:32:17,331
Where Are You?
Oh, My God. I'm So Sorry.
I'll Be There In A Jif.

624
00:32:17,331 --> 00:32:20,175
Actually, You Know What?
Kimmie's Here.

625
00:32:20,175 --> 00:32:21,999
Kimmie's There?
She Can Cover For You.

626
00:32:21,999 --> 00:32:23,300
Well, Can I Talk To--

627
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,675
I'm Here! I'm Here!

628
00:32:29,454 --> 00:32:31,487
I'm Here. I'm Here. I'm Here.
I'm Here. I'm Here.

629
00:32:31,487 --> 00:32:33,768
Betty, Look, There's Pictures
From Us Last Night

630
00:32:33,768 --> 00:32:36,550
All Over The Internet.
That's A Picture Of You
And My Elbow.

631
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:38,737
Yeah, But You Can
Totally Tell It's You.
Hi.

632
00:32:39,238 --> 00:32:41,769
Well, Here's One Bright Spot
This Morning.

633
00:32:42,425 --> 00:32:43,925
You Got "Mode"
Onto "Page Six."

634
00:32:43,925 --> 00:32:46,815
We Haven't Been There
In Ages. Good Work.

635
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:51,878
Nice Of You To Join Us.
Well, I...

636
00:32:51,878 --> 00:32:53,691
Darn. You Got Cut
Out Of That One.

637
00:32:54,062 --> 00:32:56,750
Kimmie, What About Our Pact?

638
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,940
Well, I Was An Idiot To Think
That I Could Sleep In

639
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,738
When You Have Total Seniority
Over Me, So I Covered For You.

640
00:33:01,738 --> 00:33:05,597
I Texted You.
Um, I Didn't Get A Text.

641
00:33:05,597 --> 00:33:10,113
That's Weird. I Sent One.
Nope. No Text Here.

642
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:13,300
Well,
It Must Have Gotten Lost.
(Christina) She's Lying.

643
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,925
I Should Have Known
Something Was Up

644
00:33:14,925 --> 00:33:17,878
When She Ordered Me That
Second Long Island Iced Tea.
Mm.

645
00:33:17,878 --> 00:33:19,925
By The Way, Not Tea.

646
00:33:19,925 --> 00:33:24,253
What Is She Trying To Do,
Take Your Job?
No Way. She Would Never Want
To Work That Hard.

647
00:33:24,253 --> 00:33:26,253
Kimmie's Just Always
Drawn Her Power

648
00:33:26,253 --> 00:33:28,999
From Making Me Look Bad
So She Looks Good.
Ugh.

649
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:32,628
There's No Chance That Text
Got Lost, Right?

650
00:33:32,628 --> 00:33:34,862
Well, I Texted You Five Times
This Morning,

651
00:33:34,862 --> 00:33:36,800
And You Got
Every Single One Of Those.

652
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,999
You May Have Graduated,
But High School Never Ends.

653
00:33:44,581 --> 00:33:45,988
Oh, My God.
Look How Tiny I Am.

654
00:33:45,988 --> 00:33:48,738
You're Still Tiny.
Oh, I Know.

655
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:52,378
What Are You Guys Looking At?
Oh, I Wanted To Show Them
My Cheerleading Pictures,

656
00:33:52,378 --> 00:33:53,800
So I Brought In
Our High School Yearbook.

657
00:33:54,738 --> 00:33:56,987
Wait.
You Have To See This One.
(Gasps)

658
00:33:57,441 --> 00:34:00,237
(Amanda Gasps) Oh, My God.

659
00:34:00,237 --> 00:34:03,691
Hello, Perm. It's Like Someone
Deep-Fried Your Hair.

660
00:34:03,691 --> 00:34:05,425
(Gasps) And She's Wearing
The Same Thing

661
00:34:05,425 --> 00:34:08,738
In Her Chess Club Picture
As She Is Today.
Oh!

662
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:12,316
Well, It Was A Rough Morning.
Then Or Now?

663
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:14,487
Don't Worry.
I'm Embarrassed, Too.

664
00:34:14,487 --> 00:34:17,050
I Mean, My Skirts
Are Crazy Short.
(Amanda) Mm, So Short.

665
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,628
Hey, Betty,

666
00:34:18,628 --> 00:34:20,925
Since You're Up, Would You Mind
Getting Me A Water, Please?

667
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:23,207
Yeah, Sure.

668
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:24,675
(Amanda) Oh, God.

669
00:34:41,566 --> 00:34:44,706
Betty, You Have Something
On Your Skirt.
(Gasps)

670
00:34:44,706 --> 00:34:47,050
<I>You've Got Something
<I>On Your Skirt.
<I>Hmm?

671
00:34:49,441 --> 00:34:50,894
Not Again!
(Gasps)

672
00:35:00,987 --> 00:35:02,253
What?

673
00:35:02,922 --> 00:35:04,206
What--What Are You Looking At?

674
00:35:04,206 --> 00:35:07,534
She Was--
About To Do That To Me.

675
00:35:07,987 --> 00:35:09,925
She Did It
Back In High School.

676
00:35:09,925 --> 00:35:11,300
Tell Them.

677
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:14,988
They Called Me "Granny Pants"
For Four Years.

678
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,362
I Thought We Were Friends.

679
00:35:20,112 --> 00:35:21,675
We Are.

680
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,253
We Are Friends, Kimmie.

681
00:35:24,253 --> 00:35:26,999
I Just Thought That--
I Thought That You Were Gonna...

682
00:35:28,313 --> 00:35:29,753
I'm Sorry.

683
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:30,941
Come On.

684
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:34,425
La Perla?

685
00:35:34,425 --> 00:35:35,628
Hanky Panky.

686
00:35:35,628 --> 00:35:37,379
Oh, They're Totally Hot.
Yeah.

687
00:35:37,379 --> 00:35:38,550
Granny Pants.

688
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,503
Sexy Pants.
(Chuckles)

689
00:35:46,156 --> 00:35:49,503
??

690
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,378
Hey.

691
00:36:00,563 --> 00:36:01,456
Hey.

692
00:36:01,456 --> 00:36:03,488
Bummer About The Audition,
Man.

693
00:36:03,488 --> 00:36:07,628
I Can't Believe They Picked
The Short Guy Over Us.
Right? No One's
Gonna Be Able To See Him.

694
00:36:07,628 --> 00:36:10,675
Our Vocals Were Way Better.
And Our Dance Wasn't That Bad.

695
00:36:10,675 --> 00:36:13,425
Well, You Were
Kind Of Popping Your Hip.

696
00:36:13,425 --> 00:36:15,863
Well, At Least My Jazz Squares
Weren't Triangles.

697
00:36:16,613 --> 00:36:18,362
Maybe We'll Hang Out
Sometime.

698
00:36:18,362 --> 00:36:20,675
Yeah, Uh, That'd Be Cool.

699
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,847
We'll Work It Out.

700
00:36:25,847 --> 00:36:27,238
Okay.

701
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,237
Bye.

702
00:36:34,312 --> 00:36:35,488
I've Got Your Lunch.

703
00:36:36,094 --> 00:36:40,503
A Turkey Sandwich
And A Slice Of Chocolate Cake.

704
00:36:41,063 --> 00:36:41,906
Oh, Dessert.

705
00:36:41,956 --> 00:36:43,487
Someone's In Suck-Up Mode.

706
00:36:43,487 --> 00:36:47,628
Look, Daniel, I'm So Sorry
About Being Late This Morning.

707
00:36:47,628 --> 00:36:48,800
You Know That's Not Me.

708
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,441
Betty, Look, Your Night Out
Wasn't Such A Bad Thing.

709
00:36:52,441 --> 00:36:54,500
All Those Photos
Of "Kimmie From 'Mode'"

710
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,878
Are Great Publicity.

711
00:36:55,878 --> 00:36:57,988
Really? Hey.

712
00:36:57,988 --> 00:36:59,863
Didn't We Used To Have
Someone Who Worked For Us

713
00:36:59,863 --> 00:37:01,112
Whose Job Was Just To Go Out

714
00:37:01,112 --> 00:37:02,925
And Get "Mode's" Name
In The Tabloids?

715
00:37:02,925 --> 00:37:05,738
She Was So Great
Until She Went To Rehab.

716
00:37:05,738 --> 00:37:09,175
I Bet Kimmie
Could Do That Job.
I Don't Know.

717
00:37:09,175 --> 00:37:12,628
No, Look. Look At How Many Clubs
She Got Us Into Last Night.

718
00:37:12,628 --> 00:37:15,175
I Have Never Seen Anyone
Work A Room Like Her.

719
00:37:15,175 --> 00:37:19,738
She Got George Clooney
To Come To Our Darfur Benefit.
We Don't Do A Darfur Benefit.

720
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:22,237
We Do Now.
George Clooney's Coming.

721
00:37:22,237 --> 00:37:25,378
I'm Telling You, Daniel,
She Would Be Great.

722
00:37:26,672 --> 00:37:28,503
I Guess A Little Buzz
Never Hurt.

723
00:37:30,409 --> 00:37:31,675
I'll Think About It.

724
00:37:32,391 --> 00:37:33,440
Great.

725
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:38,566
Oh, My God. I Almost Forgot
To Ask You. How Was Your Date?

726
00:37:38,566 --> 00:37:40,550
Uh, Well,
It Started Out Rough,

727
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:44,097
But It Ended Up
In A Good Place.

728
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,831
Yay!
Are You Gonna Go Out Again?

729
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:47,691
No.

730
00:37:48,063 --> 00:37:50,675
But I'll Probably
Run Into Her Somewhere.

731
00:37:51,425 --> 00:37:54,925
Now Moving On
To The Elusive Center Spread.

732
00:37:54,925 --> 00:37:56,362
Puppies Or War?

733
00:37:56,362 --> 00:37:58,675
We Want You To Know We Really
Appreciate Your Hard Work.

734
00:37:58,675 --> 00:38:03,362
We Assure You This Is All
Gonna Be Settled Very Soon.
Well, Actually, It Is Settled.

735
00:38:04,266 --> 00:38:05,050
It Is?

736
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:08,050
Love Is A Battlefield.

737
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:11,581
I Think We Both Know
How True That Is,

738
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:15,362
And I'm Sorry That
It Took Me So Long To See It.

739
00:38:17,815 --> 00:38:20,925
We'll... Ahem.
Get That Started Right Away.

740
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:22,987
Uh, One More Bit Of Good News.

741
00:38:22,987 --> 00:38:26,925
Most Of You Have Had A Chance
To Meet Kimmie Keegan By Now

742
00:38:26,925 --> 00:38:29,863
Or At Least Seen Her Photos
On "Page Six."
Whoo!

743
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:32,800
From Now On, She's Gonna
Make Sure That "Mode's" Name

744
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,612
Is Associated
With All The Coolest Events.

745
00:38:35,612 --> 00:38:38,316
Wilhelmina And I
Are Promoting Her

746
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,800
To Associate Editor.

747
00:39:13,922 --> 00:39:16,455
(Man) You Did It, Girl.
We Totally Knew.

748
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:23,613
Wow.
That's A Big Promotion.

749
00:39:23,613 --> 00:39:25,800
Yeah, It Was Your Idea.

750
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,550
I Know,
But... Associate Editor?

751
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,878
Well, If Kimmie's Gonna Be
In The Public Eye,

752
00:39:31,878 --> 00:39:34,878
She Needs A Better Title
Than "'Mode' Temp," Right?

753
00:39:34,878 --> 00:39:36,519
Besides, It's Just A Title.
It's Okay.

754
00:39:37,363 --> 00:39:39,878
(Woman)
I'm So Excited For You.
Thank You.

755
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:42,550
(Woman) We'll Talk To You
Later, Okay?
(Kimmie) Okay.

756
00:39:47,062 --> 00:39:48,175
Kimmie.

757
00:39:48,565 --> 00:39:50,269
Congratulations.

758
00:39:50,469 --> 00:39:51,988
You're Perfect For This.

759
00:39:51,988 --> 00:39:54,612
I Know, Right?
I'm Gonna Need Some Coffee.

760
00:39:54,612 --> 00:39:57,363
Half-Caf Sumatra Soy,
121 Degrees.

761
00:39:58,999 --> 00:40:02,425
I'm Not Kidding.
I'm Myself Again.

762
00:40:02,425 --> 00:40:03,999
Ever Since
You've Been Helping Me,

763
00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:06,566
My Confidence Has
Been Creeping Back In.

764
00:40:06,566 --> 00:40:08,550
I Should Thank You.
Oh.

765
00:40:08,999 --> 00:40:10,925
But I Won't,
Because I'm Popular,

766
00:40:10,925 --> 00:40:13,988
And Popular People Aren't Nice
To Unpopular People.

767
00:40:13,988 --> 00:40:16,222
It's Just The Natural Order
Of Things.

768
00:40:18,062 --> 00:40:20,050
I'm Still Waiting
On That Coffee...

769
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,394
Granny Pants.

770
