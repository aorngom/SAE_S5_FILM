1
00:00:00,206 --> 00:00:01,530
Previously on "ugly betty"...

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,450
I'm gonna enroll in a
writing class. That's great.

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:07,914
I'm gonna be a writer. The "b."
The "b" will lead you to a kiss.

4
00:00:07,995 --> 00:00:13,706
The kiss will take you to your father.
You're my "b." Gene simmons is my father.

5
00:00:13,818 --> 00:00:16,042
Motion to terminate
wilhelmina slater.

6
00:00:16,131 --> 00:00:17,794
All those in favor.
Aye.

7
00:00:17,874 --> 00:00:20,379
If i can't marry
into the meade family,

8
00:00:20,474 --> 00:00:22,659
I will give birth
to an heir.

9
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,586
All gns indicate
that you have a hostile womb.

10
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:27,514
We need to find
a surrogate we can control.

11
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,659
We're almost done.
Have a look.

12
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,124
Surprise!
Surprise!

13
00:00:33,211 --> 00:00:34,924
It's for your new salon.

14
00:00:35,355 --> 00:00:38,035
Oh, hey, you guys
are good together.

15
00:00:39,946 --> 00:00:42,531
Yeah. Really good.

16
00:00:50,163 --> 00:00:53,746
Betty, thank you so much
for letting me practice on you.

17
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:55,779
Now that
hilda's beautilities is open,

18
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:58,731
I can't risk making mistakes
on any real customers.

19
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:01,083
Hilda,
you don't make mistake-

20
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:03,035
Oh.

21
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:07,332
What? You said
you wanted princess-Y.

22
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:09,771
It's just maybe a little
too regal for a nightclub.

23
00:01:09,883 --> 00:01:11,508
I just wanted it
to be a little different.

24
00:01:11,588 --> 00:01:13,819
'S henry's band's first gig,
and i want to look cute.

25
00:01:13,898 --> 00:01:17,499
Aww, i love it.
You're a groupie.

26
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,884
Eyes.

27
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,731
I mean, technically,
i'm not a groupie,

28
00:01:21,812 --> 00:01:24,427
Because henry's not in the band.
He's the manager-

29
00:01:24,508 --> 00:01:26,284
The glue that holds
the band together.

30
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:28,835
Okay. Enough.

31
00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:30,403
Yeah, well, i think
you ought to tell the glue

32
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:33,642
That his band name is stupid.
I mean, the i.R.S.?

33
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:35,452
It's funny.
They're accountants.

34
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:37,995
The internal rhythm service.
Get it?

35
00:01:38,123 --> 00:01:40,004
No.
Eyes.

36
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:42,420
Aunt betty,
another letter.

37
00:01:42,523 --> 00:01:44,195
Oh, god, no.

38
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:45,956
I mean, interesting.

39
00:01:48,146 --> 00:01:49,891
From "the new york review."

40
00:01:50,356 --> 00:01:51,934
I submitted that piece
that i wrote about dad

41
00:01:51,998 --> 00:01:54,446
Playing dominoes
with those old men.

42
00:01:56,134 --> 00:01:57,494
Oh.

43
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,053
Well... oh, well.

44
00:02:01,126 --> 00:02:02,446
Don't feel that bad.

45
00:02:02,517 --> 00:02:04,526
Look, this one has
a real signature.

46
00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:06,861
It even smudges. Yeah, someone
actually took the time to reject you.

47
00:02:06,949 --> 00:02:09,133
Yeah, "the roosevelt weekly"
- That was totally a form letter. Yeah,

48
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:13,149
And "women's knitting journal" called
you "sir and/or madam." Okay. Not helping.

49
00:02:13,184 --> 00:02:14,333
Dinner is served!

50
00:02:15,381 --> 00:02:16,692
Maybe that'll help.

51
00:02:20,358 --> 00:02:24,245
So do we feel pregnant yet?

52
00:02:24,381 --> 00:02:25,406
Keep those legs up.

53
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,877
We don't want
anything falling out.

54
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:29,950
How long am i trapped herfor?
Well, you know what the doctor said-

55
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,823
Bed rest until
we're absolutely sure

56
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:33,581
The embryo is implanted.

57
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:36,077
Now i don't want you
lifting beer kegs

58
00:02:36,174 --> 00:02:38,285
Or whatever it is you do
in your spare time.

59
00:02:38,383 --> 00:02:41,165
Just a few more weeks. Weeks?
What am i gonna do in here?

60
00:02:41,246 --> 00:02:43,997
Mi casa es su casa.
So, uh...

61
00:02:44,077 --> 00:02:45,310
Read my books

62
00:02:45,413 --> 00:02:47,685
Or enjoy
my goose down pillows.

63
00:02:48,029 --> 00:02:48,969
Not this one.

64
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:50,193
Uh.

65
00:02:52,417 --> 00:02:54,223
Christina, i...

66
00:02:55,105 --> 00:02:57,752
I can't thank you
enough for doing this.

67
00:02:57,808 --> 00:02:59,593
You have no idea
what this means to me.

68
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:06,616
Are you trying
to hug me?

69
00:03:06,912 --> 00:03:08,832
I'm as surprised
as you are.

70
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:11,770
Thank god that passed.
Whew.

71
00:03:13,882 --> 00:03:15,492
Keep those legs up.

72
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:20,266
* shout, shout *

73
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:22,330
* let it all out *

74
00:03:22,937 --> 00:03:27,472
* these are the things
i can do without *

75
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,074
* come on... * henry, i
- I don't think

76
00:03:30,138 --> 00:03:32,697
Th those voice lessons
are really paying off.

77
00:03:33,425 --> 00:03:34,922
* come on... * yeah, i
don't know what i'm gonna do.

78
00:03:35,032 --> 00:03:36,873
This club owner says
he won't give us any more gigs

79
00:03:36,977 --> 00:03:41,001
With clyde as singer. Hey,
henry, why don't you sing?

80
00:03:41,218 --> 00:03:44,081
I've heard you karaoke. I
don't know. Karaoke's one thing.

81
00:03:44,187 --> 00:03:45,930
These people want
to hear someone good.

82
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:49,530
Well, at least the turnout's
good. Yeah, 29 people.

83
00:03:49,611 --> 00:03:52,154
If we get up to 30, we
get a cut of the door. Oh!

84
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,234
Oh.
Hey.

85
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:56,403
Yes. 30. You get
a free i.R.S. Mouse pad.

86
00:03:56,498 --> 00:03:58,618
Don't go anywhere. Be right back. Okay.

87
00:03:58,714 --> 00:04:00,650
So is that the band?

88
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:03,475
Uh-Huh. It's noteally
what your flyer suggested.

89
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,370
I guess i did sex it up a bit
so people would actually come,

90
00:04:06,475 --> 00:04:08,058
But it's important.

91
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,874
Henry's trying to make some
extra money for the baby.

92
00:04:09,953 --> 00:04:13,762
Okay, well, can i give him
20 bucks and then go home?

93
00:04:14,282 --> 00:04:17,035
Or stay
and have a beer, yeah.

94
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:19,949
It is called the beer hole,
so it's probably pretty good.

95
00:04:20,032 --> 00:04:22,144
Oh, just so you know,
there's a bar next door

96
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:23,705
Called the bear hole,
so you might have lost

97
00:04:23,785 --> 00:04:26,554
Some of your audience over there.
Oh, no. Well, i should go check.

98
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:29,153
No, no. Wait.
It's probably not a good idea...

99
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,826
Hey, hey, quick. Come
dance with me. What?

100
00:04:32,938 --> 00:04:34,930
I want to make
my boyfriend jealous.

101
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,857
Oh, um, well,
which one is he?

102
00:04:37,906 --> 00:04:39,633
You'll find out
soon enough.

103
00:04:39,772 --> 00:04:42,313
Not that one with the tattoos
over there, is it? That's him.

104
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:44,177
You can take him, though.

105
00:04:44,225 --> 00:04:45,553
Oh, right.

106
00:04:48,985 --> 00:04:51,458
Oh, look
who likes to live dangerously.

107
00:04:51,506 --> 00:04:53,266
You know,
i have the strangest fling

108
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,177
You guys are gonna be breaking
up soon. You sound confident.

109
00:04:56,258 --> 00:04:59,946
I am. Your boyfriend's
making out with another dude.

110
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,498
Okay, you got me.

111
00:05:05,618 --> 00:05:07,603
Why didn't you just
ask me to dance?

112
00:05:07,914 --> 00:05:09,387
I don't know.

113
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:11,922
I guess i'm just shy.

114
00:05:12,171 --> 00:05:14,897
Yeah.
I can tell.

115
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:16,778
* i'm talking to you *

116
00:05:18,314 --> 00:05:19,738
And one bananatini

117
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,889
For amanda tanen-
Sommers-Simmons.

118
00:05:22,202 --> 00:05:25,267
Wow. Really
see the resemblance.

119
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:27,714
Ugh. What am i
gonna do, marc?

120
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,500
I finally find out
who my real father is,

121
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,803
And he won't
return my calls

122
00:05:30,908 --> 00:05:33,090
Or my e-Mails
or my father's day cards.

123
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:37,961
Blah, blah, blah, tragedy.
You're so one-Note lately.

124
00:05:38,032 --> 00:05:40,442
Wait.
That gives me an idea.

125
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,387
Gene simmons is
a musician, right?

126
00:05:42,422 --> 00:05:45,627
So maybe you need to communicate
with him in his own language.

127
00:05:45,691 --> 00:05:46,738
Hebrew?

128
00:05:46,787 --> 00:05:49,020
No. No.
The language of music.

129
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:50,898
You should write
a song for him

130
00:05:50,962 --> 00:05:55,610
About him being your father. He can't ignore
that. You know what? If he is my father,

131
00:05:55,674 --> 00:05:57,642
I probably do have
songwriting in my genes.

132
00:05:57,721 --> 00:06:00,035
Exactly. So all you need
to do is write a song,

133
00:06:00,114 --> 00:06:02,450
Practice singing it,
record it, make a video of it,

134
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,996
Post the video on youtube
and then wait for him to see it.

135
00:06:06,082 --> 00:06:09,002
Marc, it's so simple,
it's brilliant. Mm.

136
00:06:11,835 --> 00:06:14,907
Oh, who says
white guys can't dance?

137
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:16,396
I'm renee.

138
00:06:16,492 --> 00:06:18,972
I'm daniel.
Meade. I know.

139
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,324
Oh.
Everybody knows.

140
00:06:20,388 --> 00:06:21,300
Ah.

141
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:24,836
Ooh. Your leg is vibrating,
daniel meade.

142
00:06:24,931 --> 00:06:26,389
Oh, i know.

143
00:06:26,467 --> 00:06:29,372
Oh, sorry. It's, uh, my phone. Yeah.

144
00:06:33,715 --> 00:06:34,892
Everything okay?

145
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:36,965
Yeah, it's just
a work thing.

146
00:06:37,316 --> 00:06:39,186
Can you hold on
a second?

147
00:06:39,285 --> 00:06:41,092
Oh, and stay right there?

148
00:06:41,187 --> 00:06:43,062
Don't invent
any dangerous gay boyfriend

149
00:06:43,134 --> 00:06:43,963
For anyone else.

150
00:06:44,044 --> 00:06:45,745
That's our thing, okay?

151
00:06:46,504 --> 00:06:47,712
* simply irresistible *

152
00:06:48,865 --> 00:06:50,857
Oh, oh, here he is.

153
00:06:52,482 --> 00:06:53,393
Voil?

154
00:06:53,506 --> 00:06:56,457
Oh, thank you. Could i talk
to you for a second? Oh.

155
00:06:57,281 --> 00:06:58,890
Do you still have
that list of freelancers

156
00:06:58,962 --> 00:06:59,897
On your blackberry?

157
00:06:59,985 --> 00:07:02,466
The writer for the phil roth
interview just dropped out.

158
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:05,018
What? I didn't know "mode"
was doing a piece on him.

159
00:07:05,073 --> 00:07:06,401
I love him.
You do?

160
00:07:06,482 --> 00:07:08,912
Okay, uh, daniel,
hear me out.

161
00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:11,594
Do you remember when you
accidentally made two dates

162
00:07:11,626 --> 00:07:14,208
With two different women at the
same restaurant... oh, my god.

163
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,219
And-And i had to fake
the seizure so you could run

164
00:07:16,283 --> 00:07:17,898
Out the back door
with the prettier one?

165
00:07:17,962 --> 00:07:21,633
What was the last thing you said
to me? "Betty, i owe you."

166
00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:24,418
Come on. This is a huge article. The
maоtre d' shoved a chopstick in my mouth

167
00:07:24,513 --> 00:07:26,137
So i wouldn't
swallow my tongue.

168
00:07:28,337 --> 00:07:32,049
Okay. Okay. All right.
A thousand words by friday.

169
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,608
Oh, my god. Are you serious? You're
gonna let me do this. I have faith in you.

170
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:40,148
Oh, my god, daniel. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! Besides,
who else are we gonna get on such short notice, right?

171
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:41,573
I'm just gonna pretend
you stopped

172
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,718
At "i have faith in you."
Henry!

173
00:07:47,518 --> 00:07:48,646
Let me turn on a light.

174
00:07:48,717 --> 00:07:51,325
No, no, no, keep 'em off.
It's more fun in the dark.

175
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,517
La that's not the boob you think it is.

176
00:07:59,366 --> 00:08:00,309
Mom!

177
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,716
Okay, that's like $100,000
worth of therapy right there.

178
00:08:03,798 --> 00:08:05,262
I didn't know she was here.
What are you doing here?

179
00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:07,477
I had to get out of the house.
It was too many memories.

180
00:08:07,558 --> 00:08:10,200
In the unlikely event
that whatever this is

181
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:12,638
Lasts for 40 years,
you'll understand.

182
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:14,229
I'm claire.
Renee.

183
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,246
Don't let me
get in your way, renee.

184
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:20,926
I'll just go sleep on the couch.
Do whatever you like.

185
00:08:21,005 --> 00:08:24,645
In prison, i learned
i can sleep through anything.

186
00:08:25,309 --> 00:08:26,468
I...

187
00:08:27,061 --> 00:08:29,349
She's going through
a really hard time now-

188
00:08:29,431 --> 00:08:30,725
Don't even
worry about it.

189
00:08:32,437 --> 00:08:34,140
A man that takes care
of his mom

190
00:08:34,205 --> 00:08:36,116
Knows how to treat a woman.

191
00:08:37,613 --> 00:08:39,661
We'll do this again.

192
00:08:52,069 --> 00:08:53,285
Hey, betty.

193
00:08:53,368 --> 00:08:54,453
Hi, gio.

194
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:55,741
So did you hear?

195
00:08:55,853 --> 00:08:58,038
Phil roth is in the house.

196
00:08:58,141 --> 00:09:00,069
Oh, you know
who philip roth is?

197
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,516
Author of "portnoy's complaint,"
"goodbye, columbus"-

198
00:09:02,566 --> 00:09:04,309
"American pastoral," yeah.

199
00:09:04,397 --> 00:09:07,046
Not everyone who makes
sandwiches is a lunk. Hmm.

200
00:09:07,134 --> 00:09:08,869
But the guy
in your conference room

201
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,166
Is not philip roth,
it is phil roth.

202
00:09:11,224 --> 00:09:13,364
What? Who's phil roth?

203
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:15,252
He writes books
on how to pick up chicks.

204
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:18,317
Ugh. Oh, my god.

205
00:09:18,397 --> 00:09:20,432
Daniel said phil roth,
but i just thought

206
00:09:20,512 --> 00:09:22,297
He was doing
his annoying casual thing-

207
00:09:22,376 --> 00:09:24,497
Bobby de niro,
marty scorsese.

208
00:09:24,577 --> 00:09:25,767
I don't want
to interview a guy

209
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,162
Who writes books like that.

210
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,928
Hey. You get to write
an article, okay?

211
00:09:30,054 --> 00:09:32,296
Now go in there
with an open mind.

212
00:09:32,935 --> 00:09:35,113
He's actually got
a lot to say.

213
00:09:46,175 --> 00:09:47,409
Mr. Roth?

214
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,233
Hello. I'm betty suarez.

215
00:09:49,313 --> 00:09:53,319
Um, i'm here to interview you
about your new book.

216
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,854
"Tap that!- How to score
with hot bitches."

220
00:10:11,228 --> 00:10:13,268
You titled youbook "tap
that!" "How to score with hot"-

221
00:10:13,365 --> 00:10:15,852
Yep, i see it.
It's right there.

222
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:17,420
But for the sake
of this interview,

223
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:19,124
Why don't we call it
something nicer,

224
00:10:19,188 --> 00:10:20,860
Like, uh,
"goodbye, columbus

225
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,628
So, mr. Roth, what made you
decide to write...

226
00:10:23,674 --> 00:10:25,253
"Goodbye, columbus"?

227
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,194
Men want to get laid, betty,
and i want to help them.

228
00:10:28,245 --> 00:10:31,155
Okay. Okay, so, uh,
you're a giver.

229
00:10:31,237 --> 00:10:34,012
Yes, i am.
My technique is simple-

230
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,610
Approach, subdue, score.

231
00:10:36,693 --> 00:10:39,259
Easy way to remember it-
Ass.

232
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:42,003
Okay. Ass. That's clever.

233
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:43,814
I think i smell a pulitzer.

234
00:10:43,892 --> 00:10:44,884
Oh.

235
00:10:44,997 --> 00:10:47,740
Uh, let's discuss
this technique of yours.

236
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,603
Most men think that
complimenting a woman

237
00:10:50,675 --> 00:10:51,971
Is the way to land her.

238
00:10:52,044 --> 00:10:55,868
Wrong. My method
starts with an e.K.

239
00:10:56,107 --> 00:10:57,380
Esteem killer.

240
00:10:57,453 --> 00:10:59,443
Esteem... ller.

241
00:10:59,524 --> 00:11:02,515
The easiest way to bag a woman
is to insult her.

242
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:04,940
Mr. Roth...
do you actually believe

243
00:11:05,036 --> 00:11:07,180
That women fall for that?
Betty, are you gonna be long?

244
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,774
Because calls
keep coming in for daniel,

245
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:10,148
And i'm finding it
really hard to concentrate

246
00:11:10,243 --> 00:11:13,803
On my personal issues.
Wow.

247
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,227
That is so great
that you're not worried

248
00:11:16,323 --> 00:11:18,483
What that doughnut's
gonna do to your hips.

249
00:11:19,978 --> 00:11:21,741
What did you just say to m

250
00:11:21,835 --> 00:11:24,532
Now after
the e.K. Comes the ignoring.

251
00:11:24,628 --> 00:11:26,566
Wait, so do you think
i'm fat?

252
00:11:26,628 --> 00:11:28,795
A woman can't stand it
when a guy ignores her.

253
00:11:28,859 --> 00:11:30,987
Um, pretty girl talking here.
Hello.

254
00:11:31,053 --> 00:11:33,212
Rock their confidence,
and the power is all yours.

255
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,451
Who are you? What's your name?
Why don't you li

256
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:39,363
Usually it doesn't work
that quick.

257
00:11:39,628 --> 00:11:41,004
Um... okay.

258
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,483
Uh, great.
You know what, mr. Roth?

259
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,843
I think i have
everything i need.

260
00:11:43,923 --> 00:11:45,666
So thank you very much,
mr. Roth.

261
00:11:45,715 --> 00:11:47,658
Here, let-Let me just,
uh...

262
00:11:47,715 --> 00:11:51,538
"To betty, big love,
phil."

263
00:11:52,073 --> 00:11:54,466
Thanks.
Come on, amanda.

264
00:11:54,563 --> 00:11:56,282
No, i think i love him.

265
00:11:58,475 --> 00:12:02,067
Mom, i can't tonight. I already have
dinner plans. That's just terrific.

266
00:12:02,116 --> 00:12:04,435
And your sister has
her transgender support group.

267
00:12:04,498 --> 00:12:05,515
What am i supposed to do?

268
00:12:05,595 --> 00:12:07,163
You can do anything
you'd like.

269
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,026
You know, why don't you start
reconnecting with people?

270
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:12,018
Call some of your old friends
up. Well, i would, except it seems

271
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,587
That prison, murder
and temporary insanity

272
00:12:14,635 --> 00:12:18,643
Are a turnoff to the country club set.
Okay, uh, maybe i can change my plans.

273
00:12:18,707 --> 00:12:20,267
Oh, don't bother.

274
00:12:20,315 --> 00:12:23,698
I'll just spend the night
cleaning your apartment...

275
00:12:23,778 --> 00:12:25,067
Again.

276
00:12:25,148 --> 00:12:26,385
Oh, by the way,

277
00:12:26,467 --> 00:12:30,498
I see you still keep your
magazines under the mattress,

278
00:12:30,601 --> 00:12:32,403
Just like when you were 14.

279
00:12:32,467 --> 00:12:34,915
Come on, mom. I told you
to stay out of my stuff.

280
00:12:34,978 --> 00:12:37,273
And don't go
in my top dresser drawer.

281
00:12:37,387 --> 00:12:38,290
Ooh.

282
00:12:38,402 --> 00:12:39,723
No, no.
Forget i said that.

283
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:42,570
Mom, he-Hello?
She still snooping?

284
00:12:42,602 --> 00:12:44,386
Yeah, i have got to
get her out of my place.

285
00:12:44,482 --> 00:12:46,473
She's just so lonely
these days.

286
00:12:46,564 --> 00:12:49,034
Can you look into
some of those classes

287
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,889
Or senior cruises
or something?

288
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:53,377
All right. No problem.
Oh, and, daniel. Yeah.

289
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,314
Here you go...

290
00:12:57,857 --> 00:12:59,097
A thousand words.

291
00:12:59,186 --> 00:13:00,833
You finished
your article already. Wow.

292
00:13:00,915 --> 00:13:01,970
You are eager.

293
00:13:02,011 --> 00:13:03,858
Oh, and, um, this actually
is an article

294
00:13:03,898 --> 00:13:06,042
About hilda starting
her own business.

295
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,282
It's very woman positive,

296
00:13:07,346 --> 00:13:08,835
And i think
our readers will respond.

297
00:13:08,882 --> 00:13:11,690
Where is my phil roth story?
That was the assignment.

298
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,362
Daniel, i'm sorry.

299
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:16,401
I thought that i was doing
an interview with philip roth,

300
00:13:16,469 --> 00:13:19,673
And you were just calling him
"phil." But i don't know philip roth.

301
00:13:19,753 --> 00:13:21,122
But you don't know
robert de niro,

302
00:13:21,216 --> 00:13:23,602
And you call him "bobby."
What?

303
00:13:23,682 --> 00:13:25,162
Look, this phil roth guy,

304
00:13:25,273 --> 00:13:27,106
He turned out to be
a disgusting pig.

305
00:13:27,186 --> 00:13:28,177
Do you really want to give

306
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:30,065
A guy like that
face time in your magazine?

307
00:13:30,162 --> 00:13:32,610
Betty, he writes articles
about picking up women.

308
00:13:32,689 --> 00:13:34,066
Our readers are women.

309
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,926
Don't you think they want
to know what men are thinking?

310
00:13:36,005 --> 00:13:38,757
Well, not when it's a bunch
of misogynist garbage.

311
00:13:38,869 --> 00:13:40,894
Did you even read the book?

312
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,173
No. I reread
"goodbye, columbus,"

313
00:13:44,238 --> 00:13:45,589
But, daniel, i don't
have to read the book.

314
00:13:45,687 --> 00:13:46,677
Just look at the cover.

315
00:13:46,741 --> 00:13:49,597
It is a picture of a woman
being served on a platter.

316
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:52,293
You are literally
judging a book by its cover.

317
00:13:52,357 --> 00:13:54,526
She has an apple
in her mouth.

318
00:13:55,429 --> 00:13:58,437
Look, daniel, i just...

319
00:13:58,533 --> 00:13:59,741
I can't write objectively

320
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:03,294
About a guy i can't even be
in the same room with.

321
00:14:04,357 --> 00:14:07,086
Okay.
You're off the assignment.

322
00:14:07,693 --> 00:14:09,182
Thank you.

323
00:14:09,477 --> 00:14:11,597
Actually...
i didn't want to say it,

324
00:14:11,662 --> 00:14:13,932
But, uh, phil called and asked
for a different writer.

325
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,556
I had fought for you,
but i can get someone else.

326
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,590
What? He asked for another writer? Yeah.

327
00:14:18,638 --> 00:14:21,134
He just felt you were a little,
you know, closed-Minded.

328
00:14:21,214 --> 00:14:22,240
Don't worry about it.

329
00:14:22,301 --> 00:14:26,406
Something else will come along that's
a little more you. Closed-Minded?

330
00:14:26,469 --> 00:14:29,278
Why, because i'm skeptical
of his ridiculous book?

331
00:14:29,358 --> 00:14:31,453
Yeah, and i'm gonna need
that list of freelancers, too.

332
00:14:31,502 --> 00:14:33,894
No. No.

333
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:36,950
I am just as open-Minded
as the next person.

334
00:14:37,814 --> 00:14:39,221
You know what?

335
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,533
I want to do this interview.

336
00:14:40,566 --> 00:14:42,350
I'll even read his stupid book.

337
00:14:42,413 --> 00:14:45,431
You know why?
Because i am open-Minded.

338
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:48,559
Yep.

339
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:52,909
Nice place.

340
00:14:52,974 --> 00:14:54,439
Shut up
and kiss me.

341
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,194
So... when you said
you wanted dinner...

342
00:14:57,241 --> 00:14:58,407
Mm-Hmm.

343
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,536
Oh, yeah.

344
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:01,344
I actually wanted dinner.

345
00:15:01,408 --> 00:15:03,871
And then i saw
that fine ass of yours,

346
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,092
And i was like,
"who the hell needs chicken?"

347
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,277
Not me.

348
00:15:08,372 --> 00:15:09,331
Mm.

349
00:15:09,396 --> 00:15:11,012
I hate chicken.

350
00:15:11,117 --> 00:15:12,804
Get in here.

351
00:15:38,492 --> 00:15:40,068
I see you met
my sister.

352
00:15:43,148 --> 00:15:46,076
Now wait a minute.
Your sister?

353
00:15:46,172 --> 00:15:47,795
How could you
neglect to mention

354
00:15:47,876 --> 00:15:49,637
That wilhelmina slater
is your sister?

355
00:15:49,717 --> 00:15:52,021
Didn't think it was that big of
a deal. Anyone who's read a paper

356
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:54,517
Or watched tv in, like,
the last two years

357
00:15:54,597 --> 00:15:56,268
Knows her history
with my family.

358
00:15:56,336 --> 00:16:00,764
Look, baby, i'm sorry.
I didn't plan any of this.

359
00:16:00,828 --> 00:16:04,021
I saw you, and i liked you,
and i just thought

360
00:16:04,084 --> 00:16:05,525
That telling you
i was wilhelmina's sister

361
00:16:05,605 --> 00:16:09,309
Would scare you off.
Well, it did.

362
00:16:10,598 --> 00:16:12,269
Good-Bye, renee.

363
00:16:14,204 --> 00:16:16,917
Leaving so soon?
The shower's free.

364
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:21,357
By the way, daniel, i...
underestimated you.

365
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:26,964
What the hell
were you thinking?

366
00:16:26,997 --> 00:16:28,924
That you'd react this way.

367
00:16:29,077 --> 00:16:32,332
You don't date daniel meade.
I did you a favor.

368
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:34,181
You showed up here
with no place to stay,

369
00:16:34,246 --> 00:16:37,261
And i took you in,
and this is how you repay me?

370
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,725
Calm down, wilhelmina.

371
00:16:39,772 --> 00:16:41,476
Or should i say wanda?

372
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,807
Well, you listen to me, renee,
or should i say rhonda?

373
00:16:44,855 --> 00:16:46,990
I got a lot going on
right now with this baby.

374
00:16:47,135 --> 00:16:50,639
And i don't need any of
the meades knowing my business.

375
00:16:50,711 --> 00:16:52,502
Stay away from him.

376
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:53,382
If it weren't

377
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:55,022
For the crow's-Feet
and frown lines,

378
00:16:55,118 --> 00:16:56,742
I'd think you were still
the teenage sister

379
00:16:56,822 --> 00:16:58,495
Trying to boss me around.

380
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,062
I'll date
whoever i want.

381
00:17:16,455 --> 00:17:19,607
Calcium...
for the little one.

382
00:17:21,015 --> 00:17:22,638
Wanda.

383
00:17:24,135 --> 00:17:26,174
She's wilhelmina's sister?

384
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,550
That was
a totally fake gasp.

385
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:30,439
I know. Christina already
told me, but i'm still shocked.

386
00:17:30,518 --> 00:17:31,982
Daniel, you can't date h
no, i know.

387
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:34,824
Wilhelmina tried to
destroy you

388
00:17:34,872 --> 00:17:37,255
And your family
and your magazine.

389
00:17:37,334 --> 00:17:38,414
I'm not arguing with you,

390
00:17:38,488 --> 00:17:40,280
It just sucks
because i really...

391
00:17:41,912 --> 00:17:44,495
I really-I liked renee.

392
00:17:45,561 --> 00:17:46,855
Oh.

393
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,055
Sorry, dorkstick.
I was here first.

394
00:17:51,102 --> 00:17:52,606
Um, clearly,
i was here first,

395
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,294
Because my flyer is underneath
yours. Which is where it will stay.

396
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:56,790
Look, this is important.

397
00:17:56,854 --> 00:17:59,103
I need to find
a new lead singer for my band.

398
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:01,166
Well, mine's more important
because i need to find a band

399
00:18:01,216 --> 00:18:03,847
To record my song. Yeah, well,
they're not gonna allow us to perform

400
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,351
If i don't have a new lead singer.
And i won't be able to meet my father

401
00:18:06,431 --> 00:18:10,374
If i don't find a band.
Wait, you need a band?

402
00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:12,927
Yes.

403
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:18,495
Do you know
where i can find one?

404
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:23,247
Oh, my god.

405
00:18:23,343 --> 00:18:24,863
I need to call these people
right away.

406
00:18:30,489 --> 00:18:31,943
Hello, amanda.

407
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:34,878
"Tap that!"?

408
00:18:35,294 --> 00:18:36,953
It's about tap dancing.

409
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:38,966
Ooh! Could i read it after you? No.

410
00:18:39,063 --> 00:18:42,400
And always remember, tapping
is demeaning to women. Okay.

411
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,088
Ugh.

412
00:18:45,182 --> 00:18:47,144
Okay,
that's your fourth groan.

413
00:18:47,311 --> 00:18:48,790
I'm sorry.
I can't help it.

414
00:18:48,871 --> 00:18:49,983
Just listen to this.

415
00:18:50,063 --> 00:18:52,688
"Once you've learned
the art of the 'nova,'

416
00:18:52,783 --> 00:18:55,903
You can make a woman
succumb to your will"?

417
00:18:55,966 --> 00:18:58,752
Nova? I haven't gotten
to that. What is that?

418
00:18:58,831 --> 00:19:01,224
It means pick up,
like casanova

419
00:19:01,256 --> 00:19:02,247
Or the cheap cars

420
00:19:02,313 --> 00:19:03,831
Where these guys
try and get lucky.

421
00:19:03,897 --> 00:19:07,233
"I was a complete chump,
clueless to the ways of women,

422
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:10,150
But all that changed
with my first crit."

423
00:19:10,198 --> 00:19:11,544
Crit? Where's that?

424
00:19:11,607 --> 00:19:13,399
Chapter seven.
It means criticism.

425
00:19:13,512 --> 00:19:15,473
This loser actually thinks
that insulting a woman

426
00:19:15,498 --> 00:19:16,344
Will turn the tables

427
00:19:16,384 --> 00:19:18,769
And make her want to
win you over. Genius.

428
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:19,995
What?

429
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:21,289
Heinous.

430
00:19:23,473 --> 00:19:24,488
This might work on amanda,

431
00:19:24,568 --> 00:19:26,993
But i doubt it actually works
on real people.

432
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,058
Well, you should go out,
see it in action.

433
00:19:31,122 --> 00:19:33,018
Come on. This could be
a big opportunity,

434
00:19:33,098 --> 00:19:34,650
And then
you can write about it,

435
00:19:34,682 --> 00:19:35,810
'Cause if it works,
you learn something,

436
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,146
If it doesn't, you can
call him on it in your article.

437
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,680
That's a great idea.

438
00:19:39,906 --> 00:19:43,139
All i need is some guy who could
actually pull this crap off.

439
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,937
Ah! I'll call gio.

440
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,128
Wh-Gio? Why him?

441
00:19:48,225 --> 00:19:49,778
Because
he loves this idiot.

442
00:19:49,826 --> 00:19:51,344
He's read everything
he's ever written.

443
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:54,594
Don't bother gio. I can help
you with this. Oh, honey...

444
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:55,890
This isn't you.

445
00:19:55,921 --> 00:20:00,306
Gio is a total dog.
He's perfect. Mm.

446
00:20:01,889 --> 00:20:04,354
I think i'm gonna nova
that blondie over there.

447
00:20:04,433 --> 00:20:06,042
Gio, don't you think

448
00:20:06,137 --> 00:20:07,713
She's a little
out of your league?

449
00:20:07,795 --> 00:20:11,761
League? I'm a guy. The
universe is my league. Ugh.

450
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,468
Now watch this.

451
00:20:15,741 --> 00:20:18,469
Oh. Well,
i hope you're happy.

452
00:20:18,565 --> 00:20:20,269
In the seconds
i wasted talking to you,

453
00:20:20,357 --> 00:20:22,646
Some other guy got tre.
Hmm.

454
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,765
Henry, what are you
doing here? Helping you.

455
00:20:39,853 --> 00:20:41,908
Statistically speaking,
two test subjects

456
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,660
Increases your chances of
valiting this mating theory.

457
00:20:44,742 --> 00:20:46,917
You should open with that.
Chicks love it.

458
00:20:46,965 --> 00:20:49,205
Hey, i can "tap that!"
Better than you.

459
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,317
Are you serious?

460
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:51,708
Serious as a nova.

461
00:20:51,774 --> 00:20:55,653
Okay, guys, no. This is
my research, not a contest.

462
00:20:55,701 --> 00:20:58,325
Whoever gets the most phone
numbers wins. Are you serious?

463
00:20:58,388 --> 00:20:59,636
Game on, sandwich boy.

464
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,268
What? Hold on.
Henry, you have a girlfriend.

465
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:04,932
Not tonight, i don't.

466
00:21:05,012 --> 00:21:08,183
I- I mean just for the purposes
of this research.

467
00:21:10,205 --> 00:21:11,597
Okay.

468
00:21:11,692 --> 00:21:14,925
Research.

469
00:21:15,157 --> 00:21:17,717
Oh, um, hello. I, um...

470
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,534
Okay.

471
00:21:22,084 --> 00:21:23,100
Um...
all right.

472
00:21:23,165 --> 00:21:25,852
Hello. All right. Catch you later.

473
00:21:26,212 --> 00:21:28,852
You have a beautiful face.

474
00:21:29,069 --> 00:21:31,661
Your doctor did
an amazing job.

475
00:21:31,741 --> 00:21:34,996
What? No, you did not
just say that.

476
00:21:35,805 --> 00:21:36,972
Cute outfit.

477
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:39,037
You know, some people
may call it slutty,

478
00:21:39,084 --> 00:21:42,237
But i think it really works
on you. Are you talking to me?

479
00:21:42,548 --> 00:21:44,540
That is not
your real nose.

480
00:21:44,964 --> 00:21:47,861
No, it is.
It totally is.

481
00:21:47,965 --> 00:21:49,052
Eww.

482
00:21:49,117 --> 00:21:52,309
No. Slutty would be
if it went up to here.

483
00:21:52,372 --> 00:21:54,788
I don't know.
I'm not convinced yet.

484
00:21:54,837 --> 00:21:56,260
Yeah.

485
00:22:05,069 --> 00:22:06,605
Here you go.

486
00:22:10,524 --> 00:22:12,573
You know, i love that
you have a brain.

487
00:22:12,644 --> 00:22:14,533
It's so nice to meet a girl
who doesn't buy into

488
00:22:14,613 --> 00:22:18,382
The whole skinny thing. Not
all girls have to be pretty.

489
00:22:18,461 --> 00:22:20,589
I am really impressed
that you're not intimidated

490
00:22:20,661 --> 00:22:22,156
By all the you women here.

491
00:22:22,237 --> 00:22:24,628
Man, you've got
some big feet.

492
00:22:28,565 --> 00:22:29,836
All right.
I'm gonna write it down.

493
00:22:29,901 --> 00:22:32,444
You better not lose it.
Here you go.

494
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:34,179
Hey!

495
00:22:34,332 --> 00:22:35,773
Thank you.

496
00:22:36,412 --> 00:22:37,869
Here you go.

497
00:22:40,473 --> 00:22:42,049
Hey, what are you
still doing here?

498
00:22:42,145 --> 00:22:43,512
I'm just working late.

499
00:22:43,786 --> 00:22:44,810
Who is she?

500
00:22:44,923 --> 00:22:45,977
You only work late

501
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,689
When there's a woman
to hide from.

502
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:49,209
It's mom.

503
00:22:49,305 --> 00:22:51,777
Alexis, you gotta help me.
Please takher for a while.

504
00:22:51,857 --> 00:22:54,690
No. She's been staying with me
since she was acquitted.

505
00:22:54,769 --> 00:22:56,977
She even came to
my transgender support group.

506
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,697
Everyone kept staring at her,
asking who her doctor is.

507
00:22:59,761 --> 00:23:01,609
Well, what are we gonna do?
We gotta get mom a life.

508
00:23:01,689 --> 00:23:04,152
We're not gonna babysit her
for the next 30 years.

509
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:08,080
Well, i do eat
a lot of cheese.

510
00:23:08,176 --> 00:23:11,497
Maybe you'll only be stuck with me for
20. Come on, mom. We didn't mean that.

511
00:23:11,569 --> 00:23:13,176
We're just concerned
about you, mom.

512
00:23:13,232 --> 00:23:14,600
It sounded like it.

513
00:23:14,682 --> 00:23:18,896
I'm so sorry if my trying
to rebuild my life

514
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,856
Is putting a crimp
in your social calendar.

515
00:23:20,952 --> 00:23:24,168
A year ago, i had
a husband, friends and a life.

516
00:23:24,201 --> 00:23:27,328
Now, nothing. Come
on. You still have us.

517
00:23:27,408 --> 00:23:30,136
Apparently not.
Look, let's make this easy.

518
00:23:30,184 --> 00:23:31,992
You know how the eskimos
get rid of their elders?

519
00:23:32,056 --> 00:23:33,296
They just put them
on an ice floe

520
00:23:33,361 --> 00:23:35,256
And give them a little whoosh.

521
00:23:35,336 --> 00:23:37,368
Now if you'll excuse me.

522
00:23:40,658 --> 00:23:42,193
You should probably
go talk to her.

523
00:23:42,258 --> 00:23:43,521
You should go talk to her.

524
00:23:43,601 --> 00:23:46,460
Come on, you're the daughter.
What is that supposed to mean?

525
00:23:46,917 --> 00:23:48,372
Rock, paper, scissors.

526
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,526
Ah! Why do i always
do rock?

527
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,023
So i called you
three times,

528
00:23:56,117 --> 00:23:57,909
And now i'm stopping by
the office.

529
00:23:57,989 --> 00:24:01,237
Some may say desperate.
I'm hoping you think cute.

530
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:04,429
This isn't, uh,
a good time.

531
00:24:04,588 --> 00:24:05,925
I don't know
if you know this,

532
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,221
But my sister's not
the nicest person.

533
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:12,172
And... i knew
that hooking up with you

534
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,869
Would get under her skin.

535
00:24:13,949 --> 00:24:16,229
So you used me.

536
00:24:16,277 --> 00:24:18,773
At first, but then
i got to know you better,

537
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:21,756
And it became less
about wilhelmina

538
00:24:21,837 --> 00:24:24,581
And more about you.

539
00:24:25,205 --> 00:24:26,981
Renee...

540
00:24:27,141 --> 00:24:29,285
It's just a little
too weird.

541
00:24:29,405 --> 00:24:30,981
Come on.

542
00:24:31,902 --> 00:24:33,420
I promise the next time
i use you,

543
00:24:33,501 --> 00:24:35,509
It'll just be for sex.

544
00:24:40,533 --> 00:24:42,605
I'm... i'm sorry.

545
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:43,955
It's probably better

546
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:47,237
If we just forget
this ever happened.

547
00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:10,173
Oh.

548
00:25:10,252 --> 00:25:12,021
Four, five, six.

549
00:25:12,101 --> 00:25:13,324
Final tally-

550
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,717
Gio-Six,

551
00:25:14,796 --> 00:25:17,101
Henry-Seven.

552
00:25:17,165 --> 00:25:18,677
You win. Yay, henry.

553
00:25:18,742 --> 00:25:20,509
Oh, yeah. Seven numbers.
Who's the man?

554
00:25:20,588 --> 00:25:22,605
Usually not the guy
who says, "who's the man?"

555
00:25:22,685 --> 00:25:26,797
Oh, and look, suzie made
her zeroes into little boobs.

556
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:30,575
She's a keeper. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

557
00:25:30,637 --> 00:25:32,357
What are you doing?
I'm throwing them away.

558
00:25:32,414 --> 00:25:34,992
Gio... this was
research, not for real.

559
00:25:35,071 --> 00:25:37,609
Forget research.
I earned these.

560
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:38,864
I told that girl over there

561
00:25:38,968 --> 00:25:40,649
That i'm going to iraq
next week.

562
00:25:41,536 --> 00:25:43,176
Gotta strike now.

563
00:25:43,688 --> 00:25:44,991
Classy.

564
00:25:45,056 --> 00:25:46,832
Wellwhat'd you think?

565
00:25:46,911 --> 00:25:48,040
I was pretty good
out there, huh?

566
00:25:48,136 --> 00:25:49,663
Ooh, congratulations, henry.

567
00:25:49,729 --> 00:25:51,856
You managed to set back
the feminist movement 50 years.

568
00:25:51,937 --> 00:25:53,783
Hey, it wasn't me.
It's that bo.

569
00:25:53,864 --> 00:25:54,943
You're just mad
because it worked.

570
00:25:55,024 --> 00:25:57,823
I'm upset about lot
of things, henry. Let's just go.

571
00:26:02,432 --> 00:26:05,232
I just can't believe
this phil roth guy was right.

572
00:26:05,327 --> 00:26:06,335
These poor women,

573
00:26:06,383 --> 00:26:08,608
They're being played
and they don't even know it.

574
00:26:08,688 --> 00:26:11,256
Ay, please, betty. They know
exactly what they're doing.

575
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,791
They just don't want
the guys to know it.

576
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:14,487
That way they have
all the power.

577
00:26:14,791 --> 00:26:16,928
It's not a bad book.
You read it?

578
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:21,871
I thumbed through it. Papi has it
now. Ugh. And the world is over.

579
00:26:21,936 --> 00:26:23,961
Betty, guys need
stuff like that book.

580
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:25,769
It gives them the confidence
to talk to girls.

581
00:26:25,863 --> 00:26:27,712
Otherwise they'd just be
staring at our boobs.

582
00:26:27,776 --> 00:26:29,287
And now they insult them.

583
00:26:29,335 --> 00:26:30,576
At least they're talking.

584
00:26:30,624 --> 00:26:33,136
So you're actually saying
that this is a positive thing.

585
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:37,057
I'm just saying
be a little open-Minded.

586
00:26:37,897 --> 00:26:39,871
Oh, no.
You gotta get that.

587
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,655
Daniel.

588
00:26:41,695 --> 00:26:43,119
I'm sorry to bother you.

589
00:26:43,167 --> 00:26:45,464
I've just been driving around
for hours,

590
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,583
And i don't really know
where to go right now.

591
00:26:47,656 --> 00:26:50,808
Um, clearly. You are in
jackson heights at night, alone,

592
00:26:50,863 --> 00:26:52,712
In a car that cost more
than this house.

593
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:54,623
Daniel, i'mtempted
to jump you.

594
00:26:56,192 --> 00:26:59,240
What? You think gorgeous
just happens?

595
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:03,152
I'm just so confused, betty.

596
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:05,872
So...
is this about renee?

597
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:08,136
Look, i-I know
she's wilhelmina's sister,

598
00:27:08,184 --> 00:27:11,195
And... this is wrong
in so many ways,

599
00:27:11,495 --> 00:27:13,224
But i can't stop
thinking about her.

600
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,440
Well, then maybe
you should go for it.

601
00:27:22,186 --> 00:27:25,464
What? Maybe i was wrong
about what i said earlier.

602
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:29,240
I mean, look at hilda.
We are nothing alike.

603
00:27:29,305 --> 00:27:30,856
And you and alexis?

604
00:27:31,448 --> 00:27:34,448
Who's to say renee
is anything like wilhelmina?

605
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,880
If you really like her,
then give it a chance.

606
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,112
Who knows
what it could turn into?

607
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,464
Don't touch
the yogurt, christina.

608
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:54,248
I don't eat breakfast,
but i have it there

609
00:27:54,328 --> 00:27:56,991
So i know
what i'm depriving myself of.

610
00:27:57,528 --> 00:27:58,695
Good morning.

611
00:27:58,784 --> 00:28:00,607
Sorry, i already agu
the yort.

612
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:02,655
You can lick the spoon
if you'd like.

613
00:28:02,703 --> 00:28:06,441
What the hell are you
doing here? Mm. Your sister.

614
00:28:06,535 --> 00:28:09,312
That's right.
We're back together.

615
00:28:10,111 --> 00:28:13,183
We did it on your couch, too,
and your table.

616
00:28:13,216 --> 00:28:16,747
Oh, and one more place that
i'm not gonna tell you about.

617
00:28:16,843 --> 00:28:18,835
You're really enjoying this,
aren't you? You think it's too early

618
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:22,096
To start planning family
vacations? You're a fool, daniel.

619
00:28:22,251 --> 00:28:24,707
You have no idea what you're
getting yourself into.

620
00:28:25,675 --> 00:28:28,803
But i promise you,
you'll regret it.

621
00:28:55,323 --> 00:28:57,467
Ah, i just feel like
i've heard that before.

622
00:28:57,547 --> 00:28:58,881
This is too hard.

623
00:28:59,018 --> 00:29:01,491
Okay, okay. Maybe we need
to approach this differently.

624
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,722
If gene simmons were here
right now,

625
00:29:03,898 --> 00:29:06,522
What would you say to him
from your heart?

626
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,154
No.

627
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:37,538
I can only hope

628
00:29:37,633 --> 00:29:40,394
That one day i'll have
an illegitimate daughter

629
00:29:40,483 --> 00:29:43,370
Who'll sing me a song that's
that beautiful.

630
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,266
Oh, sweetie.

631
00:29:46,123 --> 00:29:48,098
Oh, i know.

632
00:29:51,354 --> 00:29:54,218
Hey, have you talked to mom?
I've been calling her.

633
00:29:54,297 --> 00:29:55,352
No, i tried her
a couple of times, too.

634
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:56,943
She hasn't called me back.

635
00:29:57,023 --> 00:29:59,272
Oh, great. Now she's off
sulking somewhere.

636
00:29:59,386 --> 00:30:00,751
Maybe we did
kind of blow it.

637
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,551
I mean, she's always
been there for us.

638
00:30:02,647 --> 00:30:05,272
That's true. Think of all
the nights we were sick.

639
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,887
She'd stay up all night
taking care of us.

640
00:30:07,952 --> 00:30:11,510
Yeah. Wait, that wasn't mom.
That was the nanny.

641
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,855
Well, still, it's nice
she hired such a caring nanny.

642
00:30:14,927 --> 00:30:17,583
I've got news for you.
She wasn't that caring.

643
00:30:17,639 --> 00:30:19,463
She used to tie you
to each other

644
00:30:19,535 --> 00:30:21,151
And go to the movies.

645
00:30:21,928 --> 00:30:23,647
I thought
that was a game.

646
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:26,047
Mom, why didn't you
return our calls?

647
00:30:26,095 --> 00:30:27,447
Because i've been too busy

648
00:30:27,496 --> 00:30:30,793
At that stupid knitting class
you signed me up for.

649
00:30:30,823 --> 00:30:32,631
Here.
It was going to be a scarf

650
00:30:32,695 --> 00:30:34,223
Until i realized
how much i hated knitting.

651
00:30:34,288 --> 00:30:36,063
But the good news-

652
00:30:36,144 --> 00:30:39,595
I figured out what i'm going
to do with the rest of my life.

653
00:30:39,691 --> 00:30:40,635
What?

654
00:30:40,684 --> 00:30:42,156
There were all these women
in this class,

655
00:30:42,221 --> 00:30:43,523
And they were just like me.

656
00:30:43,587 --> 00:30:47,019
Their children were done
with them, and they were bored.

657
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:49,803
So i got to thinking,
we're not dead yet.

658
00:30:49,884 --> 00:30:52,507
There's got to be more out there
than knitting and bingo.

659
00:30:52,588 --> 00:30:58,371
So... i'm going to start
a magazine.

660
00:30:58,602 --> 00:30:59,930
A magazine?

661
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,971
It's for women
of a certain age

662
00:31:02,036 --> 00:31:04,770
Who aren't ready
for that ice floe.

663
00:31:04,883 --> 00:31:06,910
I'm going call it...

664
00:31:06,987 --> 00:31:08,629
"Hot flash."

665
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,467
Mom...

666
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:13,196
I- I think it's great that
you're trying to keep busy,

667
00:31:13,244 --> 00:31:16,035
But starting up a magazine
isn't that simple.

668
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,708
Oh, darling, do you think
i was married to your father

669
00:31:17,772 --> 00:31:18,948
For all those years
without learning

670
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,779
A thing or two
about this business?

671
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:24,060
I'm going to need an assistant,
a full-Time production staff,

672
00:31:24,124 --> 00:31:26,580
A suite of offices- The
seventh floor will be fine. Mom-

673
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:29,196
And i'm going to need
some start-Up capital.

674
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,251
Let's see how long
$2 million lasts me.

675
00:31:33,323 --> 00:31:34,627
Maybe we should
have dinner first

676
00:31:34,675 --> 00:31:35,924
And just talk about this.

677
00:31:35,987 --> 00:31:38,837
I'd love to, kids,
but i don't have time.

678
00:31:38,883 --> 00:31:40,276
Toodles.

679
00:31:42,555 --> 00:31:44,132
"Hot flash."
"Hot flash."

680
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,708
Oh, i'd tap that.

681
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:48,556
Hello, mr. Roth.

682
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:50,732
Thank you for...

683
00:31:50,813 --> 00:31:53,253
Meeting with me... again.

684
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:55,488
I've seen your book
in action,

685
00:31:55,553 --> 00:31:59,044
And as hard as this is
for me to admit,

686
00:31:59,306 --> 00:32:02,795
It actually works...
on some girls.

687
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:08,282
That is really cool of you
to admit that.

688
00:32:08,379 --> 00:32:11,394
You know, smart girls
usually don't get it.

689
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:14,130
Right.
Well, you can rest assured

690
00:32:14,227 --> 00:32:15,690
That the article will be
totally unbiased,

691
00:32:15,754 --> 00:32:18,562
And you should also know
that your concerns

692
00:32:18,714 --> 00:32:21,987
Were completely unwarranted.

693
00:32:22,089 --> 00:32:23,499
What c-Concerns?

694
00:32:23,602 --> 00:32:25,627
You know, the ones
you expressed to daniel

695
00:32:25,681 --> 00:32:27,274
About me not being
open-Minded enough

696
00:32:27,339 --> 00:32:29,787
To write this article. I don't
know what you're talking about

697
00:32:29,835 --> 00:32:32,284
'Cause i-I never s- I
never said that. What?

698
00:32:33,092 --> 00:32:34,069
Mnh-Mnh.
No, daniel said that you-

699
00:32:36,382 --> 00:32:38,772
Maybe you're not so smart
after all.

700
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,444
Sounds like
somebody got played.

701
00:32:46,781 --> 00:32:49,158
Good morning, daniel.
I got you a treat.

702
00:32:49,222 --> 00:32:50,670
Cinnamon twist!
I love cinnamon twists.

703
00:32:50,766 --> 00:32:52,309
Well,
you're not getting it.

704
00:32:52,406 --> 00:32:54,636
Do we always
have to play these games

705
00:32:54,686 --> 00:32:57,596
When you're mad at me? Oh,
you're one to talk about games.

706
00:32:57,677 --> 00:33:00,213
Let's see, you told me
that phil roth said

707
00:33:00,293 --> 00:33:03,817
I was closed-Minded,
but he never said that.

708
00:33:03,897 --> 00:33:05,545
Okay, yes, you're right.

709
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,425
Can i please have
the cinnamon twist?

710
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,904
No. Is that it?
That's all?

711
00:33:08,983 --> 00:33:10,809
You're not even gonna try
to deny it?

712
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:12,745
Look, i said it because i
couldn't think of anything else

713
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,944
To get you to write the article. What?

714
00:33:15,025 --> 00:33:17,552
Betty, you were quitting
because you were uncomfortable.

715
00:33:17,617 --> 00:33:19,295
Now if you want to be
a real writer,

716
00:33:19,345 --> 00:33:21,624
You can't always write about
your neighborhood

717
00:33:21,705 --> 00:33:23,609
And your family
and-And kittens.

718
00:33:23,705 --> 00:33:25,712
Well, what's wrong
with writing about that?

719
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:28,295
That's what i know.
And who doesn't like kittens?

720
00:33:28,377 --> 00:33:30,296
There's nothing wrong with
writing about what you know.

721
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:33,056
I'm just saying you should
try to know more,

722
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:34,434
Step outside
your comfort zone.

723
00:33:34,521 --> 00:33:35,905
And you did.

724
00:33:35,977 --> 00:33:38,912
Betty, your article-
It's good.

725
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:41,912
Really?
You liked it?

726
00:33:41,947 --> 00:33:42,896
Yeah.

727
00:33:42,977 --> 00:33:44,664
I'm getting published?

728
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,905
Actually, uh, you're not
getting published.

729
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:49,152
Why?

730
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,472
Alexis pulled the story.

731
00:33:50,551 --> 00:33:52,577
I guess when she was a guy
she loved phil roth,

732
00:33:52,674 --> 00:33:55,209
And as a woman, she thinks
he's kind of a pig.

733
00:33:55,289 --> 00:33:57,713
Oh! You're kidding me,
right?

734
00:33:57,793 --> 00:33:58,978
I'm sorry.

735
00:33:59,072 --> 00:34:01,888
But you did do
a fantastic job.

736
00:34:01,987 --> 00:34:03,336
And i promise,

737
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,923
There's gonna be
other assignments,

738
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,531
Better ones.

739
00:34:06,746 --> 00:34:08,290
All right.

740
00:34:08,384 --> 00:34:09,986
This totally sucks.

741
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:13,673
But, daniel, thank you

742
00:34:14,306 --> 00:34:16,482
For having faith in me.

743
00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:24,098
Thank you.

744
00:34:27,073 --> 00:34:29,080
Why are you doing
long division?

745
00:34:29,362 --> 00:34:30,730
It calms me.

746
00:34:30,765 --> 00:34:32,521
Mm. Do not be nervous

747
00:34:32,593 --> 00:34:33,929
About the band tonight.

748
00:34:33,994 --> 00:34:35,321
There is no way that amanda

749
00:34:35,353 --> 00:34:37,298
Could possibly be worse
than clyde.

750
00:34:38,057 --> 00:34:39,625
I can ask hilda
to come with.

751
00:34:40,032 --> 00:34:41,132
Oh, and i can call gio.

752
00:34:41,218 --> 00:34:43,288
He'll bring one of those girls
he met at the bar.

753
00:34:44,601 --> 00:34:46,401
Oh, you know, i'm good.

754
00:34:46,497 --> 00:34:47,961
I put up a lot of posters
in the village.

755
00:34:48,058 --> 00:34:51,545
Yeah, but if he brings someone,
then that's 20 extra bucks.

756
00:34:53,882 --> 00:34:56,050
Henry, are you serious?

757
00:34:56,146 --> 00:34:59,030
Lo, you cannot be
so competitive with him.

758
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:00,509
I have to be.

759
00:35:01,277 --> 00:35:02,486
Why?

760
00:35:02,615 --> 00:35:05,102
Because, betty,
he's always around,

761
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:07,373
And i trust you completely.

762
00:35:07,469 --> 00:35:08,629
I just don't trust him.

763
00:35:08,678 --> 00:35:11,302
So what, you think
he's gonna walk over

764
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:12,806
And knock me on the head
with a club

765
00:35:12,886 --> 00:35:14,398
And drag me back
to his cave?

766
00:35:14,477 --> 00:35:16,160
I do have some say in it.
It's just hard.

767
00:35:16,222 --> 00:35:19,581
Look, do you remember
how you felt at the bar

768
00:35:19,645 --> 00:35:21,846
Watching me
hit on all those women?

769
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:25,698
That's how i feel every time
i see gio around you.

770
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:29,354
Well... i hate
that you feel that way.

771
00:35:29,499 --> 00:35:32,092
I'm sorry.
I hate it, too.

772
00:35:34,755 --> 00:35:36,324
Look,
i- I don't want anything

773
00:35:36,403 --> 00:35:37,626
To get in the way

774
00:35:37,707 --> 00:35:40,675
Of the little time
that we have left together.

775
00:35:40,883 --> 00:35:42,994
I just won't
see him anymore.

776
00:35:43,122 --> 00:35:44,987
Now i feel stupid.

777
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:47,307
I know how much you love
his chicken salad.

778
00:35:47,386 --> 00:35:50,116
Yeah,
but i love you more.

779
00:35:53,732 --> 00:35:55,279
You will learn how to make
chicken salad, though,

780
00:35:55,391 --> 00:35:56,902
Won't you?

781
00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:00,120
Okay, remember,
look into the camera,

782
00:36:00,183 --> 00:36:02,319
Avoid your bad angles,
and i did everything i could,

783
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:04,103
But this lighting
is not your friend.

784
00:36:04,151 --> 00:36:05,566
Marc, i'm really nervous.

785
00:36:05,712 --> 00:36:08,047
Hey. You have nothing
to be nervous about.

786
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:10,145
Except for your voice,
you're a great singer.

787
00:36:10,194 --> 00:36:11,794
Ready?
Yeah.

788
00:36:12,178 --> 00:36:13,856
Hello, beer hole.

789
00:36:14,011 --> 00:36:17,057
Are you ready to rock
and/or roll?

790
00:36:19,314 --> 00:36:20,642
Okay, go.

791
00:36:22,953 --> 00:36:25,314
This one
goes out to you, daddy.

792
00:36:26,401 --> 00:36:28,266
It's mandy, bitch.

793
00:36:29,474 --> 00:36:30,898

Excuse me, ma'am.
You're in my way.

800
00:36:56,274 --> 00:36:59,370
Do you mind?
She's singing about me.

801
00:36:59,434 --> 00:37:01,898
No. She's singing about
gene simmons.

802
00:37:02,483 --> 00:37:03,643
* ooh, ooh *

803
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:08,129

Yeah!

Daddy?

820
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:04,281
Daughter?
Amanda.

821
00:38:04,386 --> 00:38:05,993
Amanda.
I can'believe you came.

822
00:38:06,081 --> 00:38:07,521
How did you know
we were doing this?

823
00:38:07,584 --> 00:38:10,409
Oh, i google myself
every morning. Me, too.

824
00:38:10,537 --> 00:38:13,221
You know, the detail of
that song, it was spot-On.

825
00:38:13,285 --> 00:38:14,924
You can't forget
a night like that,

826
00:38:15,037 --> 00:38:19,305
Or a woman like fey.
Man, cher was so pissed off.

827
00:38:19,665 --> 00:38:23,913
So it's true.
You're my father.

828
00:38:24,689 --> 00:38:27,569
Oh, my god.
I found you.

829
00:38:33,282 --> 00:38:34,584
I'll tell you what,

830
00:38:34,658 --> 00:38:37,083
Let's get outta here.
Maybe we'll catch up?

831
00:38:37,146 --> 00:38:45,721
I know we both have some questions. Come
on. Where is amanda going with gene simmons?

832
00:38:45,801 --> 00:38:47,082
Who's gonna sing?

833
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:49,338
Henry! You!

834
00:38:49,434 --> 00:38:53,009
Are you kidding? On stage,
alone? Well, what, are you afraid?

835
00:38:53,107 --> 00:38:55,393
Yes. Yes, i am afraid.
I'm terrified.

836
00:38:55,457 --> 00:38:58,073
Well, then all the more reason
for you to do it.

837
00:38:58,193 --> 00:38:59,793
It'll be good for you.

838
00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:02,392
There is only one way
that i'm doing this.

839
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:12,537
* it takes two
to make a thing go right *

840
00:39:14,017 --> 00:39:17,009
* it takes two
to make it outta sight *

841
00:39:18,001 --> 00:39:18,713
Hit it!

842
00:39:18,762 --> 00:39:19,953
* i wanna rock right now *

843
00:39:20,105 --> 00:39:22,224
* i'm rob base

00:39:26,401 --> 00:39:28,802
