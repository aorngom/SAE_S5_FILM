3
00:00:04,995 --> 00:00:07,712
<i>When you work for a company
as demanding as Veridian Dynamics,</i>

4
00:00:07,837 --> 00:00:10,551
it's important to make time
to have a personal life.

5
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,073
She seemed nice.

6
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:34,707
- That was Nadine.
- Oh, good.

7
00:00:35,403 --> 00:00:38,414
- So you know each other.
- She's one of the company's lawyers.

8
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,223
Sorry for not introducing you.

9
00:00:40,521 --> 00:00:42,126
Your tongue was kinda busy,

10
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:44,129
all up inside her mouth.

11
00:00:44,431 --> 00:00:45,744
She's amazing.

12
00:00:46,173 --> 00:00:48,018
We both work such long hours,

13
00:00:48,143 --> 00:00:49,814
it's hard to find time to go out.

14
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:51,530
So we meet in her office,

15
00:00:51,655 --> 00:00:53,246
she has a door that closes

16
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:55,150
and a closet
where we can hang our clothes

17
00:00:55,275 --> 00:00:57,894
so we're crisp and fresh
after we've soiled each other.

18
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,285
The only time I've been naked here

19
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,686
is when I was deloused.

20
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:03,879
Remember
when those super lice got out

21
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:05,759
and tried to colonize me?

22
00:01:07,123 --> 00:01:08,646
This is more fun than that.

23
00:01:13,343 --> 00:01:14,281
Bloopity-bloo.

24
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,331
Oopity-bo?

25
00:01:15,456 --> 00:01:18,090
It's a nickname for you,
right off the top of my head.

26
00:01:18,482 --> 00:01:20,454
What made you get high before work?

27
00:01:21,028 --> 00:01:22,378
I'm high on life.

28
00:01:22,577 --> 00:01:24,420
I've been trying
to write children's books?

29
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:27,628
- I just sold one. Really?
- Well, congratulations.

30
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:30,778
I sent a chapter to publishers,
and one of them bought it.

31
00:01:30,903 --> 00:01:33,206
I may have a whole new career
entertaining children

32
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:36,137
instead of working {\for a place}here
that uses them to assemble munitions.

33
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:38,514
Who'll judge us when you're gone?

34
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,547
No, but really, that's great.

35
00:01:40,672 --> 00:01:43,394
Is this the story with the creature
who looks like Phil?

36
00:01:43,677 --> 00:01:44,688
He's a lemur.

37
00:01:44,983 --> 00:01:46,965
And he doesn't look
anything like Phil.

38
00:01:47,138 --> 00:01:49,275
Their markings
are completely different.

39
00:01:49,717 --> 00:01:50,717
Hey, guys.

40
00:01:54,431 --> 00:01:55,790
Ooh, bananas!

41
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,165
I love bananas.

42
00:01:59,613 --> 00:02:00,613
Oh, god.

43
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:03,403
I stuck a tail on Phil
and put him in a tree.

44
00:02:03,528 --> 00:02:04,677
He's gonna hate that.

45
00:02:04,802 --> 00:02:06,581
Go talk to him.
Maybe he'll like it.

46
00:02:06,706 --> 00:02:09,128
But if he shows his teeth,
I'd get the hell out off there.

47
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:15,593
We all need a life outside of work.

48
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:17,605
Mine is compressed into one perfect,

49
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,176
conveniently sized bundle.

50
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,138
Daddy!
Hey, come here.

51
00:02:22,952 --> 00:02:25,605
- How's your day, sweetie?
- Awesome. Cammy threw up,

52
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,355
and then Aaron Oberlander
slipped in it, and then...

53
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,970
Grace T. hit Grace H.

54
00:02:30,095 --> 00:02:32,005
Grace S. put gum in Grace T.'s hair.

55
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,986
There were crying Graces everywhere.

56
00:02:34,298 --> 00:02:37,990
<i>Having Rose in after-care at work</i>
<i>is great, we see more of each other.</i>

57
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,903
<i>But I hear boring stories</i>

58
00:02:40,028 --> 00:02:41,837
about the children of my coworkers.

59
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,371
Then Grace told me
that Billy's dad is getting fired.

60
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,622
His name is Larry Pancake.

61
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,673
Honey, there's nobody at the company

62
00:02:48,798 --> 00:02:51,535
named Larry Pancake or anybody
else named after food.

63
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,589
What about Taco Tony
in the cafeteria?

64
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:56,949
That was just a nickname,
and we don't call him that anymore.

65
00:02:57,074 --> 00:02:59,485
When he moved to the salad bar,
it sounded racist.

66
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,331
The company has started
another round of downsizing.

67
00:03:05,456 --> 00:03:07,846
There's blood on the cheap,
industrial carpets.

68
00:03:07,971 --> 00:03:10,566
Some guy in Pete's R&D department
just got laid off.

69
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,276
Really? His name wasn't
Larry Pancake, was it?

70
00:03:13,634 --> 00:03:14,658
That's racist.

71
00:03:14,783 --> 00:03:17,342
Legal says we can't make fun
of people's names anymore,

72
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:18,948
even if it's hilarious.

73
00:03:19,261 --> 00:03:21,361
The guy's name was Larry Pancow.

74
00:03:21,874 --> 00:03:22,952
Larry Pancow?

75
00:03:23,657 --> 00:03:25,501
Yesterday in after-care, Rose heard

76
00:03:25,626 --> 00:03:27,889
that Larry Pancake
was gonna lose his job.

77
00:03:28,014 --> 00:03:31,543
How could she knew ahead of time
something that confidential?

78
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,508
One of the kids talked about it.

79
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,878
If Rose could tell us
who's about to be laid off,

80
00:03:36,003 --> 00:03:37,444
we could save their jobs.

81
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:39,677
Being fired around here
is not pretty.

82
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,012
<i>Veronica did have a point.</i>

83
00:03:42,557 --> 00:03:44,803
<i>What H.R. decides it
wants somebody terminated.</i>

84
00:03:44,928 --> 00:03:46,809
We're go on Larry Pancow.

85
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,299
<i>The extraction team
swings into action,</i>

86
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,772
<i>descending on the unwitting
employee before he or she</i>

87
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,276
<i>can remove any sensitive information
worth millions to our competitors.</i>

88
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:00,531
Larry Pancow.

89
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,076
When they lay people off
in my department

90
00:04:14,201 --> 00:04:16,297
it makes me look weak,
like they are expendable.

91
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,987
Come on, Ted.
You're a people person.

92
00:04:19,315 --> 00:04:21,577
With Rose's help,
we could save people.

93
00:04:21,863 --> 00:04:24,388
Isn't that the kind of thing
you "people" people do?

94
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:29,935
There are a lot of good people here,
and I'd like to save their jobs.

95
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,271
We can have
one conversation with Rose.

96
00:04:33,536 --> 00:04:34,356
Gently.

97
00:04:34,917 --> 00:04:38,015
Let's get her up here, crack her
open like a lobster claw

98
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,946
and scoop out her
sweet white meat of information.

99
00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:43,115
Gently.

100
00:04:43,554 --> 00:04:45,246
I know you don't
like to eat children,

101
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:46,771
but it's that kind of talk

102
00:04:46,896 --> 00:04:49,872
and your cottage made of candy
that keeps those rumors alive.

103
00:04:57,182 --> 00:04:59,437
My paycheck is a little light.
Is yours?

104
00:04:59,562 --> 00:05:01,734
I never open it
before I give it to my wife.

105
00:05:01,859 --> 00:05:04,506
She doesn't like me snooping
into our finances.

106
00:05:04,756 --> 00:05:05,596
Hey, guys.

107
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:08,992
- I sold one of my children's books.
- That's great.

108
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,981
The coolest part is,
it has a character

109
00:05:11,106 --> 00:05:13,103
that doesn't look like anyone.

110
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,448
Don't you agree?

111
00:05:15,342 --> 00:05:17,441
Wouldn't it be fun to sign
a release to that effect?

112
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:18,901
Oh, my god. It's me.

113
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,445
- It's not you, you egomaniac.
- I love it.

114
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,615
- Okay, it's you.
- I'd look good with a tail.

115
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,158
I'd look better with antlers.

116
00:05:26,502 --> 00:05:28,248
I'd have to cut the top off my car,

117
00:05:28,373 --> 00:05:30,746
but it would be totally worth it,
even in a rain.

118
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,957
Make sure they don't find out
about your book.

119
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,615
Our employment contracts
say that anything we create

120
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,419
automatically belongs to Veridian.

121
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,380
I thought
that meant science-y stuff.

122
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,715
Anything we create... science,

123
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,211
literature, poetry,

124
00:05:43,546 --> 00:05:44,728
a mournful ballad.

125
00:05:44,965 --> 00:05:47,346
Even a hearty fish chowder
I brought to a company picnic.

126
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,751
Veridian sold the recipe to the F.A.

127
00:05:49,876 --> 00:05:53,085
They use it to spray down a tarmac
when a plane is hard landing.

128
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,083
I was gonna work on it
while I was here

129
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,961
because I'm under{\a really tight }the deadline,

130
00:05:57,086 --> 00:05:59,581
but I can't risk the company
taking it away from me.

131
00:05:59,706 --> 00:06:00,859
What am I gonna do?

132
00:06:06,671 --> 00:06:08,659
You are thinking about
antlers and tails.

133
00:06:08,912 --> 00:06:11,495
Why do animals get all the best
stuff attached to their bodies?

134
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,080
I'd love to have a blow hole.

135
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:18,560
So Tasha threw hamster poo at Molly,

136
00:06:18,685 --> 00:06:20,963
and she cried because
some of it got on her grapes.

137
00:06:21,457 --> 00:06:23,412
And grapes are Molly's
ninth favorite fruit,

138
00:06:23,537 --> 00:06:24,884
after peaches,

139
00:06:25,706 --> 00:06:27,344
pears... mangoes...

140
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,431
Oh, my god, your life is trivial.
How do you stand it?

141
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,602
We're being gentle, remember?

142
00:06:33,863 --> 00:06:35,478
Less Hulk, more Bruce Banner.

143
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,518
How did you know
about Larry Pancake getting fired?

144
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,111
Grace Hutchens told me.

145
00:06:40,343 --> 00:06:42,276
That must be Bert Hutchens' kid.

146
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,849
That makes sense.
Bert is head of human resources.

147
00:06:44,974 --> 00:06:46,181
She heard it at home.

148
00:06:46,924 --> 00:06:49,616
What else did Grace say?
Is anyone else losing their jobs?

149
00:06:50,735 --> 00:06:52,870
- I don't remember.
- You don't or you won't?

150
00:06:54,825 --> 00:06:57,499
If you don't remember something,
that's perfectly okay.

151
00:06:58,193 --> 00:07:00,493
I think grace said somebody named...

152
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:03,297
Paul is also getting fired.

153
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,091
Was it Paul Spielman?
Think, honey! Think!

154
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,763
Or Veronica will inappropriately
pressure you again.

155
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,059
Pretty sure it was Paul Spielman.

156
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,382
Oh, my God.
Not Paul Spielman.

157
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,647
- You have no idea who Paul Spielman is.
- Not even a little.

158
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,691
He's one of
our department's best engineers.

159
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,621
And they're just gonna throw him out
on the street with no consideration

160
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,864
for how weak
that's gonna make me look?

161
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,532
Paul might not like it either,
'cause he's got four kids.

162
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,759
Fine, I'm insensitive.
I can live with that.

163
00:07:32,884 --> 00:07:34,745
But we have to save Paul's job.

164
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,165
<i>Not wanting the company
to know about her book,</i>

165
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,560
<i>Linda decided working on it
at the office would be too risky.</i>

166
00:07:41,685 --> 00:07:44,046
- Where are you going?
- Bathroom.

167
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:47,079
- With all your stuff?
- I meant my bathroom at home.

168
00:07:47,204 --> 00:07:50,119
I don't feel well.
So I need to go home for a few days

169
00:07:50,244 --> 00:07:51,981
and use the bathroom.

170
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:54,953
- That hangs together.
- No, it doesn't.

171
00:07:55,078 --> 00:07:57,476
If I had more time,
I'd bat you around like a cat toy.

172
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,729
But I have to save some guy's job. So do
whatever you want, because I don't care.

173
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,348
Now that hangs together.

174
00:08:05,222 --> 00:08:07,778
There are employees everywhere.
I'm like walking through spiderwebs.

175
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,906
Do you know why my paycheck
is a little light this week?

176
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:13,415
That's the code
for the company's legal services.

177
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,036
You spent four hours
with one of our attorneys last week.

178
00:08:16,921 --> 00:08:19,790
I've been seeing Nadine Webson,
but we've been doing nothing legal.

179
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,300
Wait. Let me rephrase.

180
00:08:22,425 --> 00:08:24,509
All attorneys hours
have to be billed somewhere.

181
00:08:24,634 --> 00:08:28,340
We don't care if you're estate planning
or drilling her like an oil well.

182
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,260
If you're spending time with our
lawyer, you have to pay for it.

183
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:35,389
But that's reducing my relationship with
this beautiful, intelligent woman to...

184
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:36,707
$300 an hour.

185
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:43,021
I'm sorry to barge in, Nadine.
But I just heard the strangest thing.

186
00:08:43,579 --> 00:08:46,291
Apparently the company charges
me whenever we're together.

187
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,194
Which means every time I have sex
with you, I have to pay for it.

188
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,321
Oh, my God.
That's outrageous.

189
00:08:51,828 --> 00:08:53,031
I know. It's so...

190
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,280
Naughty?

191
00:08:55,187 --> 00:08:56,869
Okay. Naughty.

192
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,621
But doesn't it also seem...

193
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,777
Extremely naughty?

194
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:04,376
Purr.

195
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,010
You argue cases with that mouth?

196
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,455
<i>Armed with information
about Spielman,</i>

197
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,227
<i>Veronica and I went into action
to save his job.</i>

198
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,618
The sky hammer missile system
is the ultimate stealth weapon,

199
00:09:25,743 --> 00:09:28,000
featuring our patented
hush-a-boom technology.

200
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,043
Hush-a-boom...

201
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:32,237
When your army wants to get in and out
without waking the neighbors.

202
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:33,804
Fantastic.

203
00:09:34,452 --> 00:09:36,452
War just keeps getting better.

204
00:09:37,128 --> 00:09:39,991
Thank you, but we really should
give credit to our engineer...

205
00:09:40,116 --> 00:09:41,389
Steven Spielberg.

206
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,540
- Paul Spielman.
- Paul Spielman.

207
00:09:43,985 --> 00:09:46,922
We shouldn't even call it
t²he sky hammer, but the Spielman.

208
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:49,047
Because that's the man's name.

209
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,797
Spielman?

210
00:09:51,662 --> 00:09:54,812
Why don't you stop that thing
we were talking about?

211
00:09:56,114 --> 00:09:57,964
That's a no-go on Spielman.

212
00:09:58,244 --> 00:10:00,390
I repeat... No-go on Spielman.

213
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:03,310
Copy that.
The bird goes back in the nest.

214
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,272
Have a nice day, sir.

215
00:10:13,027 --> 00:10:17,034
If we go past 4:00, do I have to pay
for the full hour or only the quarter?

216
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,659
I don't know.
I don't handle the money.

217
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,853
Duck. Duck. Duck...

218
00:10:24,978 --> 00:10:27,559
I don't like my work life
and my life with Rose to overlap,

219
00:10:27,684 --> 00:10:30,563
but since it was just this one time,
it's hard to see the harm.

220
00:10:30,688 --> 00:10:31,713
Goose!

221
00:10:33,206 --> 00:10:35,231
Children... So adorable.

222
00:10:35,693 --> 00:10:37,397
In a way, they're like people.

223
00:10:37,522 --> 00:10:40,309
Yes, that's why there's a taboo
about eating them.

224
00:10:40,434 --> 00:10:43,184
- So good news about saving Spielman.
- Yes.

225
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,688
It's a shame to let a resource
like Rose go to waste, isn't it?

226
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,452
No, it's not. It's fine.

227
00:10:49,577 --> 00:10:53,136
- We agreed we were gonna do this once.
- Right. We're saving people.

228
00:10:53,261 --> 00:10:56,661
Why would anyone ever want to do
something heroic more than once?

229
00:10:57,174 --> 00:11:00,902
I get it, Ted. If it had been up to you,
it wouldn't have been <i>Schindler's list</i>.

230
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:03,177
It would've been <i>Schindler's guy</i>.

231
00:11:10,095 --> 00:11:11,837
Okay, how does this story end?

232
00:11:12,288 --> 00:11:14,089
Come on. Think.
Back to basics.

233
00:11:14,352 --> 00:11:15,352
Lemur.

234
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,940
Nothing.

235
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,766
Hey, Linda. I just thought I'd stop by
on my way home and see what adventures

236
00:11:24,891 --> 00:11:26,560
my lemur brother is up to.

237
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,103
He's up to nothing.

238
00:11:28,523 --> 00:11:31,286
He stared at me as I ate a carton
of ice cream and then judged me

239
00:11:31,411 --> 00:11:33,567
as I watched
four back-to-back episodes of <i>Alf.</i>

240
00:11:33,988 --> 00:11:35,235
Maybe I can help.

241
00:11:35,922 --> 00:11:38,606
I once had an affair
with a 73-year-old woman.

242
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:41,825
- Can you use that?
- Only to vomit up the ice cream.

243
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,462
I didn't have to come here,
you know?

244
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:46,629
I'm sorry, Phil.
It's just...

245
00:11:46,754 --> 00:11:48,165
What if I can't do this?

246
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,000
Maybe I'm really not a writer.

247
00:11:50,408 --> 00:11:53,829
What if I end up just some product
tester working for a soulless company

248
00:11:53,954 --> 00:11:56,409
with a half-finished lemur story
in her drawer?

249
00:11:56,534 --> 00:11:57,507
What a cliché.

250
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,377
You can do this, Linda.

251
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:02,367
What do you have so far?

252
00:12:02,492 --> 00:12:03,888
The lemur feels stifled,

253
00:12:04,013 --> 00:12:07,353
living his small,
uninspired life in his little tree.

254
00:12:07,651 --> 00:12:10,729
His friends rally around him
and help him find the courage

255
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,856
to go off and seek his fortune.

256
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,778
What if he gets a summer job
driving a van for meals on wheels

257
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:22,532
and meets a sexually adventurous elderly
lemur who roughly takes his virginity?

258
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:26,536
- Thanks for stopping by, Phil.
- Wait.

259
00:12:27,803 --> 00:12:29,539
Why does the lemur
need to leave the tree?

260
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,607
Because the tree is stifling

261
00:12:31,987 --> 00:12:33,877
and the Linda has a dream...
The lemur...

262
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,645
The lemur has a dream,

263
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,734
and she... me...
he knows there's more to life.

264
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:40,759
Why would he want stay
in a little, tiny tree?

265
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,595
Maybe because
that's where all his friends are.

266
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,283
You said the other lemurs
rally around and help him.

267
00:12:47,408 --> 00:12:49,351
Maybe that makes him decide
he should stay.

268
00:12:50,656 --> 00:12:52,813
That's it.
That's the perfect ending.

269
00:12:53,952 --> 00:12:56,942
The lemur realizes he doesn't need
to go off and seek his fortune.

270
00:12:58,674 --> 00:13:02,027
Because the only fortune
anyone ever needs is friendship.

271
00:13:02,894 --> 00:13:04,609
And when you have that,

272
00:13:04,734 --> 00:13:07,515
you wouldn't leave it
for all the adventure in the world.

273
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,832
Suck it, Veridian!
I am rich and outta here!

274
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:18,931
I was just in the neighborhood
and thought Rose might enjoy some pizza.

275
00:13:19,056 --> 00:13:22,498
I don't usually feed Rose pizza at 11:30
on a school night while she's asleep.

276
00:13:22,623 --> 00:13:25,887
But everyone's happy to wake up
for pizza or candy

277
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,014
or a signed photograph of Zac Efron.

278
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:30,346
There she is.

279
00:13:30,797 --> 00:13:33,202
What's the matter? You couldn't sleep
because you were worried

280
00:13:33,327 --> 00:13:37,023
there might be more cutbacks,
and that might reflect badly on me?

281
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,402
No. Somebody out here isn't
using hush-a-boom technology.

282
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:43,447
I told you, we're not pumping Rose
for any more information.

283
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,297
I don't know anything else anyway.

284
00:13:45,422 --> 00:13:48,054
I told you all the new stuff
I heard at dinner.

285
00:13:48,471 --> 00:13:50,620
I couldn't resist.
I like saving people.

286
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,716
I make no apologies.
I'm sorry.

287
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,500
Oh, my god. What a hypocrite.

288
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,548
I feel like I don't know you.
Fake outrage.

289
00:13:56,673 --> 00:13:59,111
- Moving on. What did you get?
- Okay, here's the deal...

290
00:13:59,236 --> 00:14:02,090
Jeffrey Bouchard's daughter told Rose
that their family's moving on Saturday.

291
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,350
They're going to Seattle.

292
00:14:06,573 --> 00:14:09,275
Another engineer. There's a picture
of you two on your office.

293
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,829
People always want to take pictures
with me, I'm like a sunset.

294
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,521
Anyway, why is my new friend J
effrey Bouchard suddenly moving to...

295
00:14:17,077 --> 00:14:19,065
Wait.
Zell industries is in Seattle.

296
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,735
They're developing a missile system
similar to the sky hammer.

297
00:14:22,514 --> 00:14:24,747
Bouchard is planning to steal
hush-a-boom technology

298
00:14:24,872 --> 00:14:27,199
and jump ship.
How could he do this?

299
00:14:27,774 --> 00:14:29,909
And after I let him use me
like a sunset.

300
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:33,215
You better take his picture down.
Maybe put it in your drawer,

301
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,082
next to the one of you and
Saddam Hussein riding that tandem bike.

302
00:14:37,195 --> 00:14:38,869
That was before he got weird.

303
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,159
<i>The next day, bright and early,</i>

304
00:14:43,284 --> 00:14:45,884
<i>Jeffrey Bouchard
got a little surprise.</i>

305
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:53,439
<i>Thank you, lord, for everything
for all the joyous things you bring</i>

306
00:14:53,564 --> 00:14:56,019
<i>you're always looking after me</i>

307
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,199
we've got a rabbit.

308
00:15:06,596 --> 00:15:09,526
- That's Jeffrey Bouchard.
- I love it when they run.

309
00:15:12,762 --> 00:15:14,409
Tased flesh smells bacon-y.

310
00:15:15,063 --> 00:15:16,124
Now I'm hungry.

311
00:15:18,468 --> 00:15:20,585
- Nadine?
- I'll be right out.

312
00:15:22,113 --> 00:15:23,606
Can't wait tsee you.

313
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,130
I mean it.

314
00:15:25,813 --> 00:15:26,675
Hurry.

315
00:15:35,683 --> 00:15:38,019
It's gonna me 300 bucks
to get you outta that rig.

316
00:15:38,593 --> 00:15:41,649
- I thought you would like this.
- No, I do, I do. It's sexy.

317
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,709
You know what would be sexy?

318
00:15:43,834 --> 00:15:46,695
If you could do work for a client
while I take it off you.

319
00:15:47,057 --> 00:15:50,156
That would be fraud.
Now you're asking me to commit a crime.

320
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,661
A naughty, naughty crime.
Purr.

321
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:56,665
Purr.

322
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,582
Okay, first of all,
you can't just say "purr."

323
00:15:59,707 --> 00:16:01,167
You've to make the sound.

324
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,561
And that's not even
my biggest problem with all of this.

325
00:16:04,686 --> 00:16:06,415
<i>So Lem breaking of with Nadine. </i>

326
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,955
<i>After ten minutes
discussion which cost 15$.</i>

327
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:14,848
I got off the phone with my mom.
She saw my lemur on the internet.

328
00:16:15,192 --> 00:16:16,308
The internet!

329
00:16:17,202 --> 00:16:19,957
The company can't find out about this.
They'll take it away from me.

330
00:16:20,082 --> 00:16:23,356
I just turned in my manuscript, and
my publisher is already promoting it.

331
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,198
I could help promote it.
I'm a pretty decent ice skater.

332
00:16:26,323 --> 00:16:28,628
Maybe I could have my own capade.

333
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:30,822
You'll have a capade.

334
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:35,175
My mom said it's on
some asian web site.

335
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,829
Your mom is really tech savvy.
That is so hot.

336
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:41,077
Why did I say that?

337
00:16:41,753 --> 00:16:42,876
Look!

338
00:16:43,804 --> 00:16:44,975
He's so cute.

339
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:50,753
What is he doing?
I don't know. It looks like it's...

340
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,582
An ad.

341
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:58,754
For beer.

342
00:17:02,712 --> 00:17:03,912
For children.

343
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:11,067
You've a good afternoon.

344
00:17:11,192 --> 00:17:13,396
Remember,
your main job is to have fun.

345
00:17:13,648 --> 00:17:17,369
- But if you happen to hear anything...
- I'm going to concentrate on Vanessa.

346
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,060
There's something going on there.

347
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:29,324
I want to report a children's book

348
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:31,562
that a Veridian employee
sold to another company.

349
00:17:31,687 --> 00:17:33,911
I demand Veridian take
possession of it immediately

350
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:35,996
and not punish
the person who wrote it.

351
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:40,038
- I feel strongly about that last part.
- Is this that book you were writing,

352
00:17:40,163 --> 00:17:42,852
- while you were pretending to be sick?
- How did you...

353
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,023
I'm look at Phil,
and he tells me everything,

354
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:48,970
sometimes I don't want to know like his
time-saving system for washing his legs.

355
00:17:50,283 --> 00:17:53,639
I just found out my publisher is owned
by a huge, evil conglomerate

356
00:17:53,764 --> 00:17:57,009
that's using my character to
sell beer to children in Asia.

357
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,765
I love Asia.
There's no regulation on anything.

358
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:02,964
Did you know companies there
can just shoot a man in the street?

359
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,584
I heard that at a conference about
reasons to move your business to Asia.

360
00:18:07,013 --> 00:18:09,934
I know, they make it
crazy hard to kill anyone here.

361
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:11,486
I want my country back.

362
00:18:11,611 --> 00:18:14,079
Anyway, if the company
takes ownership of my book,

363
00:18:14,204 --> 00:18:16,128
they can stop these ads, right?

364
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,687
But it'll be tied up
in litigation for years.

365
00:18:18,957 --> 00:18:21,288
Your book's not gonna be
your ticket outta here.

366
00:18:22,645 --> 00:18:23,643
I've no choice.

367
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,616
Look at you.

368
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:28,023
You were so anxious
to get away from here,

369
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:30,993
and now you have a problem
and who do you come running to for help?

370
00:18:31,371 --> 00:18:33,603
The company.
The glorious company.

371
00:18:34,496 --> 00:18:37,383
- Say it with me.
- The glorious company.

372
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,603
I'm kidding.
I wanted to see if you'd do it.

373
00:18:39,728 --> 00:18:41,161
- Now say...
- Veronica.

374
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:46,777
<i>Linda didn't get to quit her day job.
But like her lemur,</i>

375
00:18:46,902 --> 00:18:50,562
<i>she realized she could find nice thing
about where she already was.</i>

376
00:18:50,687 --> 00:18:53,150
"And the lemur said to all
of his friends in the forest,

377
00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:55,759
"I love you guys, even you, lion,

378
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,823
who devoured my friend Keith.'"

379
00:18:59,182 --> 00:19:01,389
<i>And I realized maybe
using Rose's help</i>

380
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,304
<i>to know what's going on around
here isn't such a bad thing.</i>

381
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:06,234
So anything interesting
happen today?

382
00:19:06,716 --> 00:19:08,313
I found out something funny.

383
00:19:08,628 --> 00:19:11,084
Amy Bouchard's father
wasn't taking her to Seattle.

384
00:19:11,502 --> 00:19:13,401
He's taking her to see cattle.

385
00:19:13,982 --> 00:19:16,975
She isn't moving away.
Her dad just likes looking at cows.

386
00:19:18,786 --> 00:19:21,918
I've to fix something. Why don't you go
listen to the rest of that book?

387
00:19:22,043 --> 00:19:24,897
No more spying. It's my fault,
but you shouldn't do it.

388
00:19:25,022 --> 00:19:27,624
Don't let it worry you,
I'm gonna turn and run away.

389
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,500
<i>Our team...</i>

390
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,319
<i>Over 100,000 strong...</i>

391
00:19:42,334 --> 00:19:44,552
<i>And we love all of them.</i>

392
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:47,431
<i>Unless they cross us.</i>

393
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,640
<i>Then we'll hunt them down
and hurt them,</i>

394
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,502
<i>because that's love, too...</i>

395
00:20:05,114 --> 00:20:07,591
Jeffrey, there is no question
bad things were done to you,

396
00:20:07,716 --> 00:20:10,452
and there is also no question
whose fault it was.

397
00:20:13,704 --> 00:20:17,269
- I got tasered, Ted.
- I know, and I'm very sorry.

398
00:20:17,394 --> 00:20:19,342
if there's any way
I can make it up to you,

399
00:20:19,888 --> 00:20:21,004
Maybe you can.

400
00:20:22,581 --> 00:20:24,437
Let me see that taser you got.

401
00:20:34,116 --> 00:20:35,316
I'm so sorry!
