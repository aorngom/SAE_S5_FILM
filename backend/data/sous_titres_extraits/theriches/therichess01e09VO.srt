00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:02,845
<i>Previously on The Riches...

2
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:04,985
Do you really think dad has a plan?

3
00:00:05,196 --> 00:00:07,589
He stole the money, mom lost the money,

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,820
And now we're here in
a dead guy's house.

5
00:00:11,013 --> 00:00:12,456
We're gonna get caught, Di.

6
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,250
You know what happens if they find us?

7
00:00:14,391 --> 00:00:16,619
You know what happens to me?
I go back to prison.

8
00:00:16,754 --> 00:00:19,566
Once again, I listened to you,
And this has all turned to shit!

9
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:21,677
No, I want to know if
you're getting high.

10
00:00:21,853 --> 00:00:24,252
You know those little pills
we like to share?

11
00:00:25,104 --> 00:00:29,316
Do you think people like us
have a little problem?

12
00:00:29,867 --> 00:00:32,236
I want to know how you got clean.

13
00:00:33,344 --> 00:00:35,132
You been gone two days, Doug,

14
00:00:35,343 --> 00:00:36,821
Same as the money.

15
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:38,487
But people betray you,

16
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:40,944
Don't they, Doug?

17
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:43,642
Dad, you stole 40 grand
from the guy's safe.

18
00:00:43,847 --> 00:00:45,383
That Hugh guy can't prove anything.

19
00:00:45,536 --> 00:00:47,237
It don't matter. He can still fire us.

20
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:48,762
That's why we gotta get it back.

21
00:00:48,903 --> 00:00:51,809
So we gotta find a mark who's
rich, greedy, and stupid enough

22
00:00:51,996 --> 00:00:54,178
to want to drop a load
without thinking twice.

23
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:57,627
You got Rudy Blue
to invest $500,000 in Panco.

24
00:00:57,961 --> 00:01:00,272
You could sell the hair off a dog,
couldn't you?

25
00:01:00,588 --> 00:01:02,805
Maybe I should make you a partner.

26
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:08,807
Mornin', Doug.

27
00:01:08,983 --> 00:01:11,634
- Know what I'm gonna say? Guess.
- I have no idea.

28
00:01:11,751 --> 00:01:12,772
Yeah, but guess.

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,147
- Well, you're in love with me.
- No.

30
00:01:16,003 --> 00:01:18,162
Got a present for you. Looky here.

31
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,285
"<i>Employee of the month, Doug Rich.</i>"

32
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,235
Huh? Pretty cool, huh?
That's for the Rudy Blue thing.

33
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:25,434
And that's bronze-plated, man.

34
00:01:25,633 --> 00:01:27,826
I never had an employee
of the month before.

35
00:01:28,174 --> 00:01:31,916
So, I get you 500 grand,
and you get me a plaque.

36
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,124
What? Not enough?

37
00:01:33,253 --> 00:01:34,901
What the hell else you want?
Gold watch?

38
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,953
One of those Ipod nano things?

39
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,507
Well, I was hoping for...

40
00:01:38,695 --> 00:01:41,225
No, I was expecting, you know,

41
00:01:41,343 --> 00:01:42,363
a share.

42
00:01:42,574 --> 00:01:44,604
A share of what?
A share of this.

43
00:01:46,562 --> 00:01:47,794
You want to be a partner?

44
00:01:47,947 --> 00:01:49,190
A partner.

45
00:01:49,407 --> 00:01:51,624
That's what you offered me
when I bagged Rudy Blue.

46
00:01:51,823 --> 00:01:53,465
That's what I went to law school for.

47
00:01:53,606 --> 00:01:55,013
That's why I've slaved all my life.

48
00:01:55,131 --> 00:01:57,195
Shit, Doug. I said I'd think about it.

49
00:01:57,846 --> 00:01:59,137
Think means think.

50
00:01:59,825 --> 00:02:02,312
I've thought about it, too.
It seemed a really good thought.

51
00:02:02,464 --> 00:02:04,317
I want to be a partner, Hugh.
I want to sign

52
00:02:04,447 --> 00:02:05,948
partnership papers with a Panco pen.

53
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:08,393
I want to learn
the Panco secret handshake.

54
00:02:08,575 --> 00:02:13,088
I want to get the keys to some
partners-only executive bathroom

55
00:02:13,265 --> 00:02:16,033
where I can get in there
and all the toilet papers come with

56
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:17,483
origami shapes.

57
00:02:17,612 --> 00:02:19,723
I want to wipe my ass with a swan, Hugh.

58
00:02:19,905 --> 00:02:22,602
Not even I get to wipe my ass
with a swan, Doug.

59
00:02:23,793 --> 00:02:24,989
Okay, man.

60
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,881
I'm gonna marinate it over,
weigh the pros and cons,

61
00:02:28,085 --> 00:02:30,185
lt you know real soon.
In the meantime,

62
00:02:30,443 --> 00:02:32,367
you need to invite me to a dinner.

63
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,904
- A dinner?
- Exactly,

64
00:02:34,126 --> 00:02:35,856
a dinner. You invite me over.

65
00:02:35,997 --> 00:02:38,619
I check out your house,
your friends, your family,

66
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:40,261
See if you're partnership material.

67
00:02:40,425 --> 00:02:41,650
Right. Well,

68
00:02:42,507 --> 00:02:44,630
my house. You don't want
to come to my house

69
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:47,950
'Cause my family's very boring at
the dinner table. We practice

70
00:02:48,228 --> 00:02:50,304
boringness. A restaurant,
we're much more lively.

71
00:02:50,433 --> 00:02:51,676
To hell with a damn restaurant.

72
00:02:51,793 --> 00:02:53,964
You're gonna be my partner,
I want to know your life.

73
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:55,530
I need to know how you do it.

74
00:02:55,753 --> 00:02:56,773
How we do it?

75
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:58,017
How you live.

76
00:02:58,369 --> 00:02:59,659
What kind of booze you drink.

77
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,017
You can tell a lot by the quality
of a man's alcohol.

78
00:03:02,263 --> 00:03:04,187
For all I know,
you live in a damn igloo with

79
00:03:04,345 --> 00:03:05,624
10 frozen babes.

80
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,758
Well, very close.

81
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,919
Tomorrow at eight?

82
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,514
Tomorrow at eight.

83
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,265
I will call frozen babe number one,

84
00:03:13,476 --> 00:03:15,112
make sure our alcohol is up to snuff.

85
00:03:16,191 --> 00:03:18,191
Bottle of tequila and

86
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,220
some Grand Marnier...

87
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,774
And, um,

88
00:03:21,961 --> 00:03:23,369
you got any french Champagne?

89
00:03:23,521 --> 00:03:24,558
How much do you want?

90
00:03:24,635 --> 00:03:26,347
A case. I'm havin' a party.

91
00:03:26,511 --> 00:03:29,491
What's your mama's birthday?
Is she pretty? Try that.

92
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,091
This don't feel lucky. No.

93
00:03:40,337 --> 00:03:41,628
Try my birthday.

94
00:03:42,876 --> 00:03:45,674
No, my birthday never works,
except for

95
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:48,336
that one time I didn't bet on it.

96
00:03:48,676 --> 00:03:50,518
True. Sad, huh?

97
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:53,708
I need a number.

98
00:03:55,315 --> 00:03:56,711
I need a number.

99
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,198
Let's see, I need a number.

100
00:04:02,429 --> 00:04:03,767
2-4-2-1-0.

107
00:04:33,994 --> 00:04:36,211
That is not a lucky number.

108
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,653
Hi, Chunky K.

109
00:04:38,632 --> 00:04:39,653
Dolly.

110
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,346
- It's nice to see you.
- You said you'd call.

111
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,970
Why haven't you called me?

112
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:51,753
Well, I've been busy. I meant to.

113
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,260
You been out for what...?

114
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:56,316
Well, you know,
I was tryin' to get settled.

115
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,747
Where y'all live now?

116
00:05:01,327 --> 00:05:05,151
See, I'm not livin' where
I said I was gonna live.

117
00:05:05,391 --> 00:05:08,265
We're not in the rv no more, and

118
00:05:08,523 --> 00:05:10,200
my life-- well, the whole thing's

119
00:05:10,423 --> 00:05:12,921
kind of been unpredictable
since I got out.

120
00:05:13,191 --> 00:05:15,842
So you're sayin' you broke parole?

121
00:05:18,624 --> 00:05:19,668
Honey.

122
00:05:19,784 --> 00:05:21,909
Your parole officer doesn't even
know where you are?

123
00:05:21,991 --> 00:05:23,305
I didn't send him a post card.

124
00:05:23,498 --> 00:05:24,765
But it's all good. It's good.

125
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:26,694
It's been good.
It's been great, you know?

126
00:05:26,788 --> 00:05:28,665
- Things are lookin' up.
- Is this your car?

127
00:05:35,911 --> 00:05:37,471
I just lease it.

128
00:05:37,694 --> 00:05:40,544
Girl, it is beautiful.

129
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,763
You know what?

130
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:44,543
Let's go get a cup of coffee.
I want you to tell me everything.

131
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,924
Yeah, sure,
let's go get a cup of coffee.

132
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:48,355
There's a place down the street.

133
00:05:48,496 --> 00:05:50,806
Okay, cool. So, you'll meet me there.

134
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,742
Yeah, I'll meet you there. Okay.

135
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:08,282
Start the car, Dahlia. Drive away.

136
00:06:09,197 --> 00:06:10,663
Just drive away.

137
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:16,384
Shit.

138
00:06:19,465 --> 00:06:20,814
Hey, Chunky K?

139
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:24,859
I got a better idea.
You want to ride with me?

140
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,213
Why don't you come to
my house for a visit?

141
00:06:36,826 --> 00:06:38,351
This is my home.

142
00:06:40,028 --> 00:06:41,436
Oh, my God.

143
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:43,084
This is like

144
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,632
rich people live here.

145
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,093
It's like cinderella.

146
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,875
It's a dream.

147
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:55,071
Is it yours?

148
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,710
Yeah, it's mine.

149
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,898
You're not tricking me, are you?

150
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,818
I mean, you're not really
the maid or something like that.

151
00:07:05,604 --> 00:07:06,754
The nanny?

152
00:07:08,062 --> 00:07:10,267
Maybe some lady's coming home soon?

153
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:13,545
I... I'm the lady.

154
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,712
I'm the lady.

155
00:07:20,122 --> 00:07:22,257
Hey, you're right. It is a dream.

156
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:26,022
Remember how discouraged
you used to be?

157
00:07:26,286 --> 00:07:29,347
Crying yourself to sleep every night,

158
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,860
And I told you

159
00:07:31,874 --> 00:07:33,634
things would be lookin' up.

160
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,528
Yes, you did.

161
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,686
I was right, wasn't I?

162
00:07:38,695 --> 00:07:39,903
Yes, you were.

163
00:07:54,127 --> 00:07:55,851
This is bigger than our cell.

164
00:07:57,224 --> 00:07:59,711
Our cell was at least two of those.

165
00:07:59,904 --> 00:08:01,570
These are so beautiful.

166
00:08:01,752 --> 00:08:03,370
Of course, they don't fit.

167
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:06,051
I tell you Dolly,

168
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,362
it's bigger than my room right now.

169
00:08:08,526 --> 00:08:09,722
What do you mean?

170
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:12,179
It's a temporary situation.

171
00:08:12,343 --> 00:08:16,273
I rent a foldout couch from
a very nice lady.

172
00:08:16,424 --> 00:08:17,621
You don't even have a bed?

173
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,357
Somebody else rents the bedroom,

174
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:22,043
but I only pay $300 for the couch.

175
00:08:22,242 --> 00:08:23,779
I'm out of prison now,

176
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,606
and I've got to find my own way.

177
00:08:28,535 --> 00:08:29,550
Yes, you will.

178
00:08:29,761 --> 00:08:30,969
Can I ask you something?

179
00:08:31,145 --> 00:08:33,544
- Yes, you can.
- How did you go from prison

180
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:36,289
to all this? I mean,
how is that possible?

181
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:39,667
I didn't do nothin'.
I mean, it was Wayne.

182
00:08:39,837 --> 00:08:41,749
Since when is your husband rich?

183
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,684
He went to law school when
I was locked up.

184
00:08:46,837 --> 00:08:50,180
In just two years,
he got all this green?

185
00:08:51,724 --> 00:08:54,035
He went to law school on a fast track,

186
00:08:54,246 --> 00:08:57,683
and then he got a real good job
right when he left,

187
00:08:58,058 --> 00:09:01,624
and he also made
some real good investments.

188
00:09:02,313 --> 00:09:03,321
That's him now.

189
00:09:03,738 --> 00:09:06,295
Baby, we got 24 hours

190
00:09:06,523 --> 00:09:09,995
to figure out how the Riches
throw a damn dinner party.

191
00:09:10,224 --> 00:09:11,807
Babe, we're up here!

192
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:13,484
What's this?

193
00:09:13,707 --> 00:09:15,091
That's cashmere.

194
00:09:17,373 --> 00:09:18,991
I'm the same, Chunky.

195
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:24,777
I'm rich,
but my heart ain't no different.

196
00:09:29,586 --> 00:09:31,041
This is Chunky K.

197
00:09:31,515 --> 00:09:34,530
She was my cellie in prison.

198
00:09:36,895 --> 00:09:39,042
And she's a real good friend of mine.

199
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:40,707
Hi, Wayne.

200
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,625
I'm sorry. Chunky--

201
00:09:42,795 --> 00:09:45,047
Chunky K.
That's what everybody calls me

202
00:09:45,223 --> 00:09:46,853
'cause I used to be real chunky,

203
00:09:47,405 --> 00:09:49,023
Then I did the Jenny Craig.

204
00:09:50,683 --> 00:09:53,627
Well, uh, nice to meet you, Chunky K.

205
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:55,463
It's so funny to meet you

206
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,469
'cause I know everything about you.

207
00:09:57,622 --> 00:10:00,695
I mean, Dolly's told me so
many great things,

208
00:10:01,369 --> 00:10:02,765
like what a man you are.

209
00:10:02,976 --> 00:10:05,029
That's what we do in the joint.

210
00:10:05,228 --> 00:10:07,985
We tell stories about
how life was before.

211
00:10:10,127 --> 00:10:12,696
- Can I use your bathroom, sweetheart?
- Sure.

212
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:19,699
Well, you are a man, baby.

213
00:10:21,863 --> 00:10:23,165
Why is she here?

214
00:10:24,244 --> 00:10:25,640
I ran into her.

215
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:28,913
It's fate.

216
00:10:29,335 --> 00:10:30,508
What did you tell her?

217
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:32,514
I didn't tell her nothin'.

218
00:10:32,772 --> 00:10:34,625
She gonna stay for dinner,
she gonna go home.

219
00:10:34,836 --> 00:10:35,915
She lives an hour away.

220
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,193
I can't always be livin'
in fear, Wayne.

221
00:10:39,703 --> 00:10:41,844
I didn't even tell her
I was a traveler.

222
00:10:42,055 --> 00:10:43,064
I mean,

223
00:10:43,233 --> 00:10:44,465
she's my friend.

224
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,535
I tried to leave her in
the liquor store. I couldn't do it.

225
00:10:56,262 --> 00:10:57,822
Are you happy, Dolly?

226
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:06,244
I mean, with my family, I guess.

227
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:11,612
You don't have your braid no more.

228
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:16,128
Good.

229
00:11:16,984 --> 00:11:18,427
It's prettier now.

230
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:28,395
Yes, I know it's last minute,
but that's the point.

231
00:11:28,641 --> 00:11:31,720
It's a last-minute dinner party.
That's what they call it.

232
00:11:33,371 --> 00:11:35,271
It's immediate.
It's in the moment.

233
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,467
Excellent.

234
00:11:36,543 --> 00:11:39,112
Our next-door neighbors will be
gracing us with their presence.

235
00:11:39,182 --> 00:11:41,188
Great! Okay, so,
it's tomorrow night at 8:00.

236
00:11:41,364 --> 00:11:42,384
Okay. Bye.

237
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,551
But no one else is coming.

238
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,827
Frankly, we don't know anyone else.

239
00:11:47,996 --> 00:11:49,322
We could always try strangers.

240
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:51,985
Yes, and speaking of strangers,
where the hell is your mother?

241
00:11:52,137 --> 00:11:53,568
You said she was with her friend.

242
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,459
Yes, she is. She's with
her old friend, Chunky K.

243
00:11:56,681 --> 00:12:00,447
I'm sorry, but does anybody else think
The name Chunky K is hilarious?

244
00:12:00,631 --> 00:12:02,798
- Better than Fatty K.
- Apparently, she was Fatty K,

245
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:04,290
but then jenny craig got involved.

246
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,805
You know, you really shouldn't
make fun of mom's friend.

247
00:12:06,978 --> 00:12:10,086
I'm not making fun of her.
That's her name-- miss Chunky K.

248
00:12:10,332 --> 00:12:12,397
If I was to call her
miss slightly Heavy K

249
00:12:12,561 --> 00:12:14,051
Then that would be making fun of her.

250
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,596
But she prefers chunky.
That's how she introduced herself.

251
00:12:17,716 --> 00:12:19,535
We had such a great time.

252
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:20,672
We bought dinner.

253
00:12:20,847 --> 00:12:22,642
This is my old friend, Chunky K.

254
00:12:23,615 --> 00:12:26,935
I like a little ice
and lots of mountain dew, please.

255
00:12:27,123 --> 00:12:28,683
When you can't have booze like me,

256
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:31,280
You get real particular
about your drinks.

257
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,110
Let's see how this is here.

258
00:12:33,943 --> 00:12:35,163
That's perfect, Wayne.

259
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,990
You are a great bartender,

260
00:12:38,283 --> 00:12:40,653
And you are a very pretty girl.

261
00:12:41,451 --> 00:12:42,459
Thanks.

262
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:44,729
- I mean it.
- No, it's just, you know, I don't...

263
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:46,641
I don't really care about looks much.

264
00:12:46,826 --> 00:12:48,843
Beautiful people never do.

265
00:12:49,177 --> 00:12:50,772
Life is funny like that.

266
00:12:51,147 --> 00:12:52,883
Can I ask you a question?

267
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,238
Hit me.

268
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:56,314
What were you in prison for?

269
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,219
- Maybe that's private, Sammy.
- There's nothin' private about me.

270
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:00,686
You all are like my family.

271
00:13:01,002 --> 00:13:03,078
In fact, just call me aunt Chunky.

272
00:13:03,207 --> 00:13:04,779
Okay! Aunt Chunky.

273
00:13:05,582 --> 00:13:07,037
Yeah, that sounds good.

274
00:13:07,195 --> 00:13:08,438
Aunt Chunky.

275
00:13:13,397 --> 00:13:15,098
I committed a murder, Sam.

276
00:13:19,321 --> 00:13:21,831
My husband used to beat me real bad,

277
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,274
So, one day, I killed him on accident.

278
00:13:26,341 --> 00:13:28,113
You killed him on accident.

279
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,259
I pray to God for forgiveness every
time I see a certain kind of knife.

280
00:13:34,737 --> 00:13:36,461
So you went to prison for murder?

281
00:13:36,614 --> 00:13:38,033
No, car theft.

282
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:42,331
Lady luck was on my side,

283
00:13:42,507 --> 00:13:44,232
and I would have gotten
away with it, too,

284
00:13:44,384 --> 00:13:46,578
until I got caught in
a car I didn't own.

285
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,968
and that was God's way of saying,
"<i>You don't have to go so far, Chunky.</i>"

286
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:52,760
"<i>Take it easier next time.</i>"

287
00:13:53,235 --> 00:13:54,572
Good point, God.

288
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:58,273
God made an excellent point.

289
00:13:59,301 --> 00:14:01,471
So was Dahlia all right in prison?

290
00:14:04,028 --> 00:14:05,348
She was all right.

291
00:14:05,676 --> 00:14:07,471
The first day I spent with your mom,

292
00:14:07,728 --> 00:14:09,957
I knew she had personality.

293
00:14:10,185 --> 00:14:12,988
You know what your mom did
in prison to earn money?

294
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,287
- What?
- Palm reading.

295
00:14:15,885 --> 00:14:18,641
You know, tellin' people
what they're gonna do in life.

296
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,090
Life line, money line, how many
kids they were gonna have.

297
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:26,779
You would be surprised at how many
fortunes she came up with for them.

298
00:14:27,435 --> 00:14:30,227
Then one day, I went to the library,

299
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,048
checked out a book,
and realized

300
00:14:33,271 --> 00:14:35,289
she was wrong about
the whole thing.

301
00:14:35,518 --> 00:14:37,852
She made the whole thing up!

302
00:14:40,735 --> 00:14:42,811
When she came into the joint,

303
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:46,049
I wasn't bored no more.

304
00:14:46,412 --> 00:14:47,632
It was like...

305
00:14:49,072 --> 00:14:50,714
I got to be in her light,

306
00:14:50,925 --> 00:14:51,957
you know?

307
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:05,001
Dolly, I gotta leave.

308
00:15:05,188 --> 00:15:08,661
You have got such a great family,
but I gotta go.

309
00:15:08,877 --> 00:15:11,200
What you talkin' about?
We haven't even eaten yet.

310
00:15:11,364 --> 00:15:12,513
I gotta get home.

311
00:15:12,765 --> 00:15:16,178
Britney and K-Fed will take
my spot on the couch.

312
00:15:16,412 --> 00:15:18,723
- Who?
- The other tenant's pit bulls.

313
00:15:18,946 --> 00:15:21,761
I mean, they're nice dogs,
but I can't control them.

314
00:15:21,969 --> 00:15:23,834
And if they fall asleep on the couch,

315
00:15:24,033 --> 00:15:25,441
Then I end up sleeping on the floor

316
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,101
Because I'm scared they'll bite me.

317
00:15:27,241 --> 00:15:29,106
They already bit me once. Look.

318
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:31,112
My God, that's awful.

319
00:15:31,311 --> 00:15:33,868
Shit. You really got bad luck, man.

320
00:15:34,588 --> 00:15:35,808
You ever try throwin' salt?

321
00:15:35,984 --> 00:15:39,127
Throwin' salt? Girl, that is
some sort of old wives' tale.

322
00:15:39,362 --> 00:15:41,479
No, it works.
Come on, let's do it.

323
00:15:41,526 --> 00:15:43,661
Let's think about your luck changin'
and throw salt.

324
00:15:43,685 --> 00:15:45,397
Is that how you got this house?

325
00:15:45,702 --> 00:15:47,766
Yeah, kind of, so let's try.

326
00:15:48,992 --> 00:15:51,057
Put that in there.
I'm gonna do it, too, with you.

327
00:15:51,244 --> 00:15:52,470
Okay, stand on one leg.

328
00:15:52,657 --> 00:15:54,194
- On one leg.
- Close your eyes.

329
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:56,410
Lean on me, so you don't fall over.

330
00:15:56,618 --> 00:15:59,281
Lucky!
One, two, three. Throw it!

331
00:15:59,844 --> 00:16:00,876
Oh, God!

332
00:16:01,726 --> 00:16:02,887
What the hell are you doing?

333
00:16:02,981 --> 00:16:03,990
It's salt.

334
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:06,752
- What are you throwing salt at me for?
- Trying to find some luck.

335
00:16:06,811 --> 00:16:08,195
Go wash your eye, baby.
I'm--

336
00:16:08,823 --> 00:16:10,277
I'm sorry about that.

337
00:16:11,644 --> 00:16:13,573
- Are you okay?
- Kiss my ass!

338
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,146
Don't go. Oh, Chunk, don't go.

339
00:16:22,557 --> 00:16:24,434
Come on, don't go.

340
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,067
Don't leave me here,
please, baby. You gotta stay.

341
00:16:27,221 --> 00:16:28,711
We have so much room here.

342
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:31,386
I don't want to send you home
to Britney and K-Fed,

343
00:16:31,608 --> 00:16:34,341
The dumbass dogs gonna bite you.
It's retarded.

344
00:16:34,462 --> 00:16:36,327
Are you sure your husband won't mind?
I mean,

345
00:16:36,515 --> 00:16:38,075
the man's got a eye full of salt.

346
00:16:39,424 --> 00:16:40,867
Not the firstime.

347
00:16:46,283 --> 00:16:48,030
I'm excited about this dinner party,

348
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:50,704
you know? I mean, I even went to
the library, and I found

349
00:16:51,033 --> 00:16:55,185
a book by Emily Post on how
to throw a real fancy buffer dinner.

350
00:16:56,384 --> 00:16:59,246
I got a real good recipe, and I'm gonna
cook it up as best I know how,

351
00:16:59,481 --> 00:17:01,182
but I have a right to have a friend.

352
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:03,305
So would you stop being
so friggin' paranoid?

353
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,572
I am not paranoid.

354
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:07,118
I am completely
good-humored and relaxed.

355
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,549
You are?

356
00:17:13,476 --> 00:17:14,496
You are?

357
00:17:17,675 --> 00:17:20,209
I'm sorry. I'm just high-strung.

358
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,599
You think?

359
00:17:21,768 --> 00:17:23,115
I'm sensitive, you asshole.

360
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,604
A "mushroom boat"?
You think we can make a mushroom boat?

361
00:17:25,756 --> 00:17:27,340
I think you're mad at me,

362
00:17:27,527 --> 00:17:29,803
and you're just not expressing it.

363
00:17:30,513 --> 00:17:31,885
She is a risk.

364
00:17:33,176 --> 00:17:35,029
And she is a little freaky.

365
00:17:35,844 --> 00:17:37,615
And I think she's on drugs...

366
00:17:38,178 --> 00:17:39,820
Not to be critical.

367
00:17:43,048 --> 00:17:44,772
What makes you say that?

368
00:17:45,054 --> 00:17:46,579
Just a feeling I got.

369
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:54,036
She's my friend, Wayne.

370
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,581
When you go to prison,

371
00:17:57,004 --> 00:17:59,514
People beat the shit out
of you for nothin'.

372
00:18:01,033 --> 00:18:03,098
I was lucky Chunky was my cellie.

373
00:18:03,795 --> 00:18:06,200
She lived there a long time
before I got there.

374
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,047
There's was this one chick,
she was,

375
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,369
like, three cells down from us,
and I don't why, but she hated me.

376
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:12,859
She tried to kill me,

377
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,818
but Chunky stepped in,

378
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,324
And that bitch never
bothered me again.

379
00:18:19,943 --> 00:18:21,046
She was...

380
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,374
noble.

381
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:25,638
Man, she was noble.

382
00:18:25,943 --> 00:18:27,526
Like a noble warrior in...

383
00:18:28,323 --> 00:18:31,085
the shittiest-ass situation
you can imagine.

384
00:18:31,472 --> 00:18:33,009
She protected me.

385
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,621
She saved my life.

386
00:18:39,011 --> 00:18:40,512
But now she's here...

387
00:18:41,016 --> 00:18:42,283
in my house,

388
00:18:42,729 --> 00:18:43,926
And she's alone,

389
00:18:45,065 --> 00:18:46,953
&nd she's havin' a bad time.

390
00:18:49,557 --> 00:18:52,783
Least in prison, you don't
have to fight a dog for a bed.

391
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:25,999
She is in there looking at Sam's mural.

392
00:19:26,234 --> 00:19:27,242
So?

393
00:19:27,489 --> 00:19:29,307
Probably just thinks
it's a pretty picture.

394
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,732
Chunky K is clearly a lover of art.

395
00:19:32,978 --> 00:19:34,381
So she's gonna stay here all day?

396
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,888
- You want her at the dinner party?
- Why do you keep asking me this?

397
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:38,169
I told you she was goin'.

398
00:19:38,473 --> 00:19:40,303
- When?
- She got a job, baby.

399
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:43,482
She's the weekend supervisor
At a sewage treatment facility.

400
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:45,898
Don't you make fun of her.

401
00:19:46,074 --> 00:19:48,113
I'm not making fun of her.
When I was little,

402
00:19:48,266 --> 00:19:51,984
I, too, wanted to supervise sewage
on the weekend.

403
00:19:52,031 --> 00:19:53,720
It's the best job
she could get. Come on.

404
00:19:53,755 --> 00:19:55,609
- I know.
- And she's gotta be there by 2:00.

405
00:19:55,697 --> 00:19:57,609
Good. So she'll be outta here by noon?

406
00:19:57,785 --> 00:19:59,779
She's gonna go, Wayne.
She'll be gone by noon.

407
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:03,738
- So you can quit sweatin' it.
- I'm not sweatin' it. I'm very calm.

408
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:05,274
Got to get groceries.

409
00:20:05,485 --> 00:20:06,811
Don't forget my pork rinds.

410
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,702
hat are y'all doing
with all these boxes?

411
00:20:11,699 --> 00:20:13,282
We're just unpacking, you know?

412
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:14,913
We never really moved in.

413
00:20:15,112 --> 00:20:16,994
We just moved the stuff we had around.

414
00:20:18,246 --> 00:20:20,134
Who's Doug Rich?

415
00:20:22,961 --> 00:20:26,123
He is a friend of dad's, actually.

416
00:20:26,404 --> 00:20:28,234
And he just left his diploma
at your house?

417
00:20:28,401 --> 00:20:31,169
He's on vacation, so we're just
looking after a couple of things.

418
00:20:31,316 --> 00:20:33,116
We should probably take
better care of that

419
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,356
'cause if he comes back,
he'll be pissed off about the thing.

420
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:36,957
That's a good idea, Cal.

421
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:38,461
We've gotta clean up this house

422
00:20:38,653 --> 00:20:40,195
good today, for real.

423
00:20:40,547 --> 00:20:42,635
- What's the big deal?
- Dad's boss is comin'.

424
00:20:42,917 --> 00:20:44,794
If he likes us,
he'll make dad a partner.

425
00:20:45,532 --> 00:20:46,541
What's that mean?

426
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:47,625
what does that mean?

427
00:20:47,707 --> 00:20:50,018
It means that instead of having
just a piece of the pie,

428
00:20:50,053 --> 00:20:51,309
We might own the whole bakery.

429
00:20:51,391 --> 00:20:53,162
So you need to make a good impression?

430
00:20:53,373 --> 00:20:55,684
He's real curious about us.
Wants to see how we live.

431
00:20:55,871 --> 00:20:57,161
Then we need to keep goin'.

432
00:20:57,566 --> 00:20:59,654
I wish you'd sit down.
You're workin' too much.

433
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:00,768
I want to help.

434
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,971
I worked all my life
for people I can't stand.

435
00:21:04,281 --> 00:21:07,421
Why can't I do some work for
someone that I love for a change?

436
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,533
Besis, cleanin' is fun for me.

437
00:21:09,814 --> 00:21:12,465
I'd make a pretty good maid
If someone was to

438
00:21:12,747 --> 00:21:14,166
take a chance on me.

439
00:21:14,353 --> 00:21:15,843
Who wants to be a maid, anyway?

440
00:21:16,054 --> 00:21:17,591
- I do.
- No, you don't.

441
00:21:17,814 --> 00:21:18,822
Sure, I do.

442
00:21:19,157 --> 00:21:20,623
I come pretty cheap,

443
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:22,512
and I'm very good at

444
00:21:22,887 --> 00:21:25,150
making order out of, you know,

445
00:21:25,397 --> 00:21:26,746
chaotic situations.

446
00:21:26,957 --> 00:21:29,960
Well, I think you could do just
about anything you put your mind to.

447
00:21:30,282 --> 00:21:33,514
I just want a job that
I can make a livin' on, Dolly.

448
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,584
Supervising sewage on
the weekend don't pay my bills.

449
00:21:40,514 --> 00:21:41,522
You're still here.

450
00:21:42,121 --> 00:21:44,385
Take off your shoes.
Chunky just mopped the floor.

451
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:46,320
Thought she had to
get to work by 2:00.

452
00:21:46,801 --> 00:21:48,502
The time has slipped up on me.

453
00:21:48,877 --> 00:21:50,713
Dear. Should I call you a cab?

454
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:53,211
Yeah, sure, if you want to.

455
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:54,454
Great.

456
00:21:54,677 --> 00:21:56,613
Might want to get your things.

457
00:22:07,343 --> 00:22:08,739
What the hell are you doing?

458
00:22:08,938 --> 00:22:11,424
Just huntin' for
my white shoulders, Wayne.

459
00:22:11,858 --> 00:22:15,155
Right. Well, your taxi's here.
Are you ready to go?

460
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:17,673
Don't you rush me.

461
00:22:19,197 --> 00:22:20,640
Listen, let me pay you.

462
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,176
For what?

463
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,724
For helping us get ready
for the party.

464
00:22:26,064 --> 00:22:28,970
I don't want your money, Wayne.
You all are like family.

465
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,750
I give my family money all the time.

466
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,485
That's too much.

467
00:22:35,825 --> 00:22:38,206
No, that's just the right amount
for special help.

468
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,018
Special help?

469
00:22:40,241 --> 00:22:43,161
You know, help that comes in,
helps out, and then leaves.

470
00:22:43,537 --> 00:22:45,355
Are you trying to bribe me?

471
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:49,542
$500 would go a long way

472
00:22:49,871 --> 00:22:51,830
to getting you off that couch.

473
00:22:52,052 --> 00:22:54,316
How dare you try to bribe me.

474
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:01,747
Did it ever occur to you that
your best friend in prison

475
00:23:01,934 --> 00:23:03,893
might not be your
best friend in real life?

476
00:23:04,737 --> 00:23:06,931
- Why are you so against her?
- I'm not against her.

477
00:23:07,224 --> 00:23:09,687
I like her.
I mean, what's not to like?

478
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:10,918
She's in there,

479
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:12,525
sniffing glue.

480
00:23:12,713 --> 00:23:13,957
God knows what else she sniffs.

481
00:23:14,162 --> 00:23:15,945
- How do you know?
- 'Cause I saw her.

482
00:23:18,557 --> 00:23:19,941
Man, all right, she sniffs glue.

483
00:23:20,223 --> 00:23:21,619
She's sniffin' glue.

484
00:23:22,006 --> 00:23:24,903
If you just got out of jail, maybe you,
too, would sniff a little glue

485
00:23:25,114 --> 00:23:26,510
from time to time, you know?

486
00:23:26,721 --> 00:23:29,290
Who are you to say that
it makes her a bad person, you know?

487
00:23:29,436 --> 00:23:31,342
Maybe it just makes her
a stressed-out person,

488
00:23:31,489 --> 00:23:33,976
Or a person with problems
that you don't understand!

489
00:23:34,134 --> 00:23:35,841
- I don't give a shit!
- She is a danger.

490
00:23:35,993 --> 00:23:38,022
She can threaten
our whole way of life here.

491
00:23:39,277 --> 00:23:41,400
Baby, we got so much.

492
00:23:41,611 --> 00:23:43,405
We are thrivin' here.

493
00:23:43,933 --> 00:23:45,740
A thought keeps comin' into my head.

494
00:23:46,061 --> 00:23:49,685
What are we gonna do
now with all this good fortune?

495
00:23:49,967 --> 00:23:52,149
Are we just gonna
keep it to ourselves?

496
00:23:52,589 --> 00:23:55,298
Are we gonna build a big
old wall around us so that

497
00:23:55,509 --> 00:23:58,008
nobody could ever get in
to threaten what we got?

498
00:23:58,277 --> 00:24:01,707
There's a big old wall around Edenfalls.
You want to build one around our house?

499
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:04,268
What's next? Maybe you want to
build one around our minds?

500
00:24:04,397 --> 00:24:05,781
You know that's not what I want.

501
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,687
It's not what I want, either.

502
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:10,925
Take a risk, baby.

503
00:24:12,062 --> 00:24:13,716
Come on. Nothing risked,
nothing gained.

504
00:24:13,853 --> 00:24:16,246
Isn't that what we do?
That's how we live.

505
00:24:16,727 --> 00:24:18,850
We are different from buffers, Wayne.

506
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:21,005
We live here,

507
00:24:21,264 --> 00:24:24,055
but that don't change the fact
that in our souls, we are different.

508
00:24:24,313 --> 00:24:25,615
And all I'm saying is,

509
00:24:25,885 --> 00:24:28,395
every so often,
It might be nice to share.

510
00:24:29,773 --> 00:24:31,193
Just to give a little

511
00:24:31,756 --> 00:24:33,679
To someone who really needs it.

512
00:24:38,027 --> 00:24:39,670
I want to give her a job.

513
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,142
I want to give her a great-payin' job.

514
00:24:43,353 --> 00:24:44,394
I do.

515
00:24:54,718 --> 00:24:59,290
All right. Flowers,
raspberries, got my book.

516
00:25:00,327 --> 00:25:03,956
Oh, my God... the salad.
Oh, I need a salad!

517
00:25:04,081 --> 00:25:08,103
You gotta have salad! Shit!
Gotta have a salad!

518
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,482
Oh, my God! Is it hot in here?

519
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,555
Everything's ready in
the dining room, ma'am.

520
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,435
Don't call me ma'am.

521
00:25:19,636 --> 00:25:22,335
Jesus Christ, look at that uniform.

522
00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:25,121
Man, this whole maid
thing is really weirdin' me out.

523
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:28,045
Well, don't all the Rich people
around here have maids just like me?

524
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:31,642
- You know, I don't want be one of them.
- I don't care, Dolly.

525
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:34,125
If I don't work for you,
I got to work for somebody.

526
00:25:34,234 --> 00:25:36,654
Either I wear a uniform,
or I don't make jack.

527
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,230
- Okay, just don't call me ma'am.
- Yes, I am.

528
00:25:39,336 --> 00:25:41,637
I'm gonna call you ma'am because
I don't want to slip up

529
00:25:41,705 --> 00:25:44,694
- And say the wrong thing at the party.
- No, no, you're right.

530
00:25:44,844 --> 00:25:46,283
In front of other people,

531
00:25:46,424 --> 00:25:49,663
- Wayne is Doug and I'm Cherien.
- Knock knock!

532
00:25:49,922 --> 00:25:51,847
Nina! Hey, I'm here to help.

533
00:25:52,003 --> 00:25:54,788
Oh, I'm so happy you're
here. Well, I know that

534
00:25:54,945 --> 00:25:57,761
the domestic sciences is
not exactly your forte.

535
00:25:57,874 --> 00:25:59,459
Could you put this in the fridge

536
00:25:59,563 --> 00:26:01,452
And preheat the oven to
375, won't you, honey?

537
00:26:01,534 --> 00:26:02,544
Yes, ma'am.

538
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,184
Oh, yeah. Nina,

539
00:26:05,528 --> 00:26:06,541
this is...

540
00:26:06,603 --> 00:26:07,624
This is the...

541
00:26:07,702 --> 00:26:08,813
The maid.

542
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,296
- How you doin', ma'am?
- Hangin' in there.

543
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:16,098
Could you, uh, make us a drink, honey?

544
00:26:16,217 --> 00:26:17,656
Anything, straight up

545
00:26:17,797 --> 00:26:19,706
- in a large glass.
- Yes, ma'am.

546
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:22,119
- Yeah. Yeah, for me, too.
- Yes, ma'am.

547
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:25,342
- Okay. What's that?
- Frozen dinner rolls.

548
00:26:25,492 --> 00:26:27,729
Heat 'em up, nobody knows
the difference, and...

549
00:26:27,854 --> 00:26:29,450
What is... Oh.

550
00:26:32,661 --> 00:26:33,694
She's great.

551
00:26:33,834 --> 00:26:36,150
Uh, you're usin' paper napkins?

552
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,841
- Is that bad?
- Well, it ain't exactly classy.

553
00:26:39,076 --> 00:26:40,109
Ma'am?

554
00:26:40,997 --> 00:26:42,124
Thank you.

555
00:26:43,657 --> 00:26:44,815
Thank you.

556
00:26:45,112 --> 00:26:47,772
Could you find us some real
cloth napkins, honey?

557
00:26:47,912 --> 00:26:49,050
Yes, ma'am.

558
00:26:50,982 --> 00:26:53,079
So, look at you.

559
00:26:53,282 --> 00:26:54,894
You got yourself a maid.

560
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,959
I got... I got a maid.

561
00:27:00,748 --> 00:27:01,754
It's okay.

562
00:27:02,635 --> 00:27:04,059
Vodka gimlet?

563
00:27:04,216 --> 00:27:05,577
The glasses are chilled.

564
00:27:05,702 --> 00:27:07,298
Oh! All the better.

565
00:27:07,478 --> 00:27:09,340
Don't get frostbite there, Jim.

566
00:27:09,637 --> 00:27:11,280
Vodka gimlet. How very...

567
00:27:11,479 --> 00:27:12,855
Douglas Sirk.

568
00:27:17,105 --> 00:27:18,466
Come in. Come in.

569
00:27:19,868 --> 00:27:21,401
Cherien, our guest of honor

570
00:27:21,526 --> 00:27:23,998
has just crossed the threshold
in our humble abode.

571
00:27:24,131 --> 00:27:27,604
Oh, now, Doug, you
forget, I'm a humble man.

572
00:27:28,783 --> 00:27:31,036
Well, Hugh, would you
care for a cocktail?

573
00:27:31,224 --> 00:27:33,054
Nina, Jim, what do you have?

574
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:35,996
We have Martinis, dry or
dirty, We have Manhattans,

575
00:27:36,171 --> 00:27:38,753
- and vodka gimlets.
- I'll take it dry, Doug.

576
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:40,943
See, Martinis, vodka gimlets,

577
00:27:41,068 --> 00:27:44,682
that's a classy way to go. I'm not down
with all that Mai-Tai fruity cosmo shit.

578
00:27:45,217 --> 00:27:47,017
- The glasses are chilled.
- Chilled?

579
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,551
Oh, chilled.

580
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,939
Well, in that case, thank you.

581
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:54,458
You got a maid, Doug?

582
00:27:54,592 --> 00:27:57,299
Yes, we got a maid for special
occasions. Her name is...

583
00:28:01,005 --> 00:28:02,132
Cicatrice.

584
00:28:02,225 --> 00:28:03,633
Cicatrice?

585
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,167
Isn't that french for "scar"?

586
00:28:08,477 --> 00:28:09,807
So, tell me,

587
00:28:10,213 --> 00:28:12,936
what do you think of
your employers, cicatrice?

588
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:16,465
- Excuse me, sir?
- Doug and Cherien... Are they cheap?

589
00:28:16,844 --> 00:28:18,722
Of course we're not cheap, Hugh.

590
00:28:18,831 --> 00:28:21,084
We pay everyone who works
for us extremely well.

591
00:28:21,209 --> 00:28:23,744
Who said that's the right
answer, Doug? Don't interrupt.

592
00:28:24,364 --> 00:28:26,867
Oh, I got an idea. I got an idea.

593
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,807
Cicatrice, I want you to think of

594
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,382
three adjectives that describe
Doug and Cherien,

595
00:28:31,554 --> 00:28:33,964
And if I like your
adjectives and I like my dinner...

596
00:28:35,995 --> 00:28:37,716
I'm gonna make Doug here a partner.

597
00:28:38,373 --> 00:28:39,468
If I don't,

598
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:42,582
he's out on the street.

599
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:48,327
Well, let's see.

600
00:28:48,452 --> 00:28:50,267
Oh, that's okay,
darlin'. Don't tell me now.

601
00:28:50,349 --> 00:28:52,723
Think about it. Get back to
me by the end of the night.

602
00:28:59,558 --> 00:29:01,451
I don't think I'm doin'
so well out there.

603
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:04,157
Oh, well... No, you're
doin' just great, honey.

604
00:29:04,317 --> 00:29:06,257
You look all
professional and everything.

605
00:29:06,648 --> 00:29:08,573
All I know is I am so not a cook.

606
00:29:08,729 --> 00:29:11,717
So, the blond guy is the boss?

607
00:29:12,315 --> 00:29:14,302
Well, he kind of put me
on the spot out there.

608
00:29:14,474 --> 00:29:15,804
Oh, he did?

609
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:17,060
Don't mind him.

610
00:29:17,218 --> 00:29:19,278
He's the boss, But, you
know, he's a human being.

611
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:21,033
He was a big old drug addict,

612
00:29:21,158 --> 00:29:22,488
all down on his luck.

613
00:29:22,911 --> 00:29:24,600
Then he had a business idea,

614
00:29:24,907 --> 00:29:27,332
and he was all hungry
and persistent and shit

615
00:29:27,614 --> 00:29:29,116
and made a billion dollars.

616
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:31,431
If he can do it, anyone can.

617
00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:35,346
All I'm saying is, you know, You
just got to follow your bliss.

618
00:29:35,596 --> 00:29:39,383
I've got some good business ideas, but I
just never had the nerve to act on 'em.

619
00:29:39,496 --> 00:29:42,531
Okay, uh, will you serve the
oysters Rockefeller, please?

620
00:29:42,672 --> 00:29:43,970
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

621
00:29:54,522 --> 00:29:55,914
It's just a barrette.

622
00:30:19,502 --> 00:30:22,397
In all these years, I never
let anybody else partner before.

623
00:30:22,901 --> 00:30:25,954
But now, I'm thinking, maybe it'd be
nice to have another dog to run with.

624
00:30:26,013 --> 00:30:27,029
Somebody...

625
00:30:27,152 --> 00:30:29,159
to share the
responsibility, Share the load.

626
00:30:29,409 --> 00:30:30,708
See, the thing is,

627
00:30:31,274 --> 00:30:33,074
how do I know you're the right guy?

628
00:30:33,355 --> 00:30:36,218
I mean, I'm a loner by nature.
I mean, you know my life story.

629
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,941
- Yes, you told me many times.
- Oysters Rockefeller?

630
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,053
Ooh, sure. Sure.

631
00:30:41,691 --> 00:30:43,178
You got my adjectives yet?

632
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:47,214
Oh, I started out broke. I started out
cleaning septic tanks for a livin'.

633
00:30:47,777 --> 00:30:50,625
I saved every penny I earned, Cleanin'
up other people's shit.

634
00:30:50,831 --> 00:30:53,319
And the first thing I
did, folks thought I was crazy.

635
00:30:53,475 --> 00:30:55,744
I went out and I
bought a used septic tank.

636
00:30:55,885 --> 00:30:58,303
I bought it, slapped a
little paint on it, polished it up,

637
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,181
sold it for twice what I paid for it.

638
00:31:00,463 --> 00:31:03,889
Went from septic tanks to
sewer lines to spec houses,

639
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:07,757
real estate king. That's
how I went rags to Riches.

640
00:31:07,758 --> 00:31:09,599
And that's what makes
Panco so damn special.

641
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,571
I built that company
off the sweat of my back.

642
00:31:11,572 --> 00:31:14,125
- I'll tell anybody who wants to listen.
- I want to listen.

643
00:31:14,388 --> 00:31:15,471
Oh, you do, huh?

644
00:31:15,987 --> 00:31:18,476
'cause I'm broke, but I got a
business plan, and, believe me,

645
00:31:18,594 --> 00:31:20,271
- I know how to sweat.
- Cicatrice.

646
00:31:22,433 --> 00:31:24,311
What's your business plan, honey?

647
00:31:25,015 --> 00:31:26,072
It's okay.

648
00:31:26,401 --> 00:31:27,904
I don't want to disturb your night.

649
00:31:28,046 --> 00:31:31,073
- That's very kind of you, cicatrice.
- No, you're not disturbing me.

650
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:34,525
I'm open to giving business advice to
anybody at all. What you got, honey?

651
00:31:39,156 --> 00:31:40,658
Good for the nuts.

652
00:31:41,615 --> 00:31:43,758
This is a business plan
that I have been waitin'

653
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:45,323
to discuss with the right individual.

654
00:31:45,644 --> 00:31:48,585
- It's about rabbits.
- Cicatrice.

655
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,147
Rabbits, huh?

656
00:31:51,303 --> 00:31:53,932
Maybe there's a few facts you
don't know about rabbits.

657
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:57,640
They got a very good
meat. Very tasty, low in fat.

658
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,797
They got a good, white,
meaty-tasting meat.

659
00:32:01,095 --> 00:32:03,754
In the same way that
people eat turkey now,

660
00:32:04,286 --> 00:32:07,196
They're gonna eat rabbit in
the future. I'll tell you why.

661
00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:11,643
Turkeys lay an egg every so
often when they're in the mood,

662
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:12,816
But rabbits,

663
00:32:14,281 --> 00:32:15,564
they multiply like...

664
00:32:16,111 --> 00:32:17,160
rabbits.

665
00:32:20,574 --> 00:32:22,185
You get what I'm sayin'?

666
00:32:23,562 --> 00:32:25,987
Oh, my God.

667
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:29,845
I don't know how she
cooks or cleans, Doug...

668
00:32:31,836 --> 00:32:33,651
But, damn, she...

669
00:32:35,381 --> 00:32:37,328
is funny.

670
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:46,846
Rabbit... Rabbit burger.

671
00:32:47,144 --> 00:32:48,345
Rabbit burger.

672
00:32:49,365 --> 00:32:50,375
Bunny burgers.

673
00:32:50,446 --> 00:32:51,479
Bunny burgers.

674
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:53,536
Rabbit burgers.

675
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:56,233
How many times you spin that salad?

676
00:32:57,007 --> 00:32:58,685
Hey, be gentle there.

677
00:32:58,814 --> 00:33:00,520
You're lucky you didn't
break that plate.

678
00:33:00,626 --> 00:33:02,422
You're not my employer, ma'am.

679
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:06,709
- Oh, boy.
- Cicatrice,

680
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:08,240
is everything all right?

681
00:33:08,332 --> 00:33:09,542
Everything's fine, ma'am.

682
00:33:11,629 --> 00:33:13,302
Well, I think dinner is ready.

683
00:33:15,524 --> 00:33:18,681
Oh, I can't possibly do
that. Can you slice the pork?

684
00:33:19,175 --> 00:33:20,228
Thank you.

685
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,176
I can't do that.

686
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,729
- More wine, anyone?
- Me, I want some.

687
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,936
I'm still waitin' on my
adjectives, cicatrice.

688
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,192
What you got so far?

689
00:33:46,689 --> 00:33:47,944
Oh, hello there.

690
00:33:49,246 --> 00:33:50,525
Who's this pretty lady?

691
00:33:50,889 --> 00:33:53,657
Hey, and where's your other son,
Doug? Didn't you say you have two?

692
00:34:00,131 --> 00:34:01,363
This is my son, Hugh.

693
00:34:01,597 --> 00:34:02,636
This is Sam.

694
00:34:06,802 --> 00:34:10,744
- Uh, I hear he loves the theatre.
- Oh, yes, he does.

695
00:34:11,142 --> 00:34:15,459
We are actually just, um, On our way to
the school play after we finish eating.

696
00:34:15,945 --> 00:34:17,048
Isn't that right, Sam?

697
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,537
Well, sorry partner. I didn't
recognize you as a member of the b-Team.

698
00:34:22,205 --> 00:34:23,296
What's the b-Team?

699
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:26,952
Boys? The boys' team, kid.

700
00:34:28,838 --> 00:34:30,704
So what, is that... Is that pork?

701
00:34:30,845 --> 00:34:32,815
What's that you're
carvin' on there, Cicatrice?

702
00:34:32,861 --> 00:34:34,104
I thought jews didn't eat pig?

703
00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:36,752
Well, you know it's not kosher.

704
00:34:37,549 --> 00:34:38,594
What?

705
00:34:38,758 --> 00:34:42,253
You know, darling, kosher? Kosher?

706
00:34:42,438 --> 00:34:45,394
Sometimes I think she has a
complete block on the word kosher.

707
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:46,942
Everybody knows kosher.

708
00:34:47,038 --> 00:34:51,261
- so why are you serving pork?
- That's exactly the point, Jim.

709
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,339
Cherien and I belong
to a sect of judaism

710
00:34:54,538 --> 00:34:56,239
That eats mainly pork,

711
00:34:56,568 --> 00:34:58,949
Um, to make up for the
jewish people that don't eat pork.

712
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:02,015
That's why they were thrilled and
overjoyed When we decided to marry.

713
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,236
Had pig at our weddin'.

714
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,398
Pig on the honeymoon.

715
00:35:04,556 --> 00:35:06,216
Pig at the bar mitzvah. Remember that?

716
00:35:07,121 --> 00:35:09,323
Too bad it's not rabbit.
Everybody eats rabbit, right?

717
00:35:09,324 --> 00:35:10,679
Nobody has a problem with that.

718
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,757
And I hear they multiply like rabbits.

719
00:35:15,315 --> 00:35:17,579
oh, I have a problem with
it. I would never eat rabbit.

720
00:35:17,661 --> 00:35:18,844
Well, I've eaten rabbit

721
00:35:18,938 --> 00:35:21,390
in a restaurant. Rabbit soup

722
00:35:21,507 --> 00:35:22,539
or was it venison?

723
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:25,871
Personally, I find the idea of
eating a peaceful animal Like the rabbit

724
00:35:25,898 --> 00:35:26,981
to be morally repulsive.

725
00:35:27,396 --> 00:35:28,545
You think I'm repulsive?

726
00:35:28,967 --> 00:35:31,724
I was just referring To those
who butcher peaceful animals.

727
00:35:32,158 --> 00:35:35,419
Well, at least I'm not gay.

728
00:35:38,481 --> 00:35:39,548
- Who's gay?
- Cicatrice.

729
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:40,600
Who's gay?

730
00:35:40,651 --> 00:35:42,120
I do not think that that is the way

731
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:44,419
that the household help
should speak to a guest.

732
00:35:45,569 --> 00:35:47,950
Well, maybe I don't
want to be the maid no more,

733
00:35:48,078 --> 00:35:50,401
And maybe I quit, dolly.

734
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:12,408
Well, I gotta take a leak. I'll be back.

735
00:36:13,707 --> 00:36:15,438
Don't you be
followin' me in there, jimmy.

736
00:36:21,456 --> 00:36:24,640
A nice southern girl like myself needs
to get herself a cool glass of vodka

737
00:36:24,657 --> 00:36:26,694
before she loses her temper in public.

738
00:36:34,355 --> 00:36:35,563
That was awful!

739
00:36:36,771 --> 00:36:37,827
Poor Jim.

740
00:36:38,038 --> 00:36:39,387
And she called me dolly.

741
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,336
Yeah, don't worry about
that. Nobody noticed.

742
00:36:41,389 --> 00:36:44,873
Mom, maybe you should go upstairs
and talk to her and calm her down.

743
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,320
You know what?

744
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,914
You take Sam and go over
to Brents house.

745
00:36:51,779 --> 00:36:53,515
- Didi, please.
- Okay.

746
00:36:54,008 --> 00:36:56,401
Come on, Sam. Let's take a field trip.

747
00:37:06,968 --> 00:37:08,173
I think I hear laughing.

748
00:37:12,173 --> 00:37:14,237
Oh, Jesus Christ, chunky!

749
00:37:14,263 --> 00:37:16,750
What's wrong with you,
idiots? Shut the goddamn door!

750
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,768
I like that maid of yours.
She knows how to take a joke.

751
00:37:34,606 --> 00:37:37,142
Little too into the rabbit thing.
She's just tryin' to get by.

752
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:40,155
I remember when people used to
laugh about me and my septic tanks, too.

753
00:37:40,331 --> 00:37:43,360
Cicatrice is a wonderful person
with an unbeatable personality.

754
00:37:43,496 --> 00:37:44,559
Do I look high?

755
00:37:45,893 --> 00:37:46,960
Are bears catholic?

756
00:37:49,422 --> 00:37:51,569
I guess you could
say I fell off the wagon.

757
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,466
She offered it to me like
candy, and I could not refuse.

758
00:37:54,782 --> 00:37:57,682
So does snortin' some kind of white
powder mean I ain't sober no more?

759
00:37:57,818 --> 00:37:59,045
Last time I checked.

760
00:37:59,671 --> 00:38:00,902
well, what the hell.

761
00:38:01,626 --> 00:38:02,800
Let's just, uh...

762
00:38:03,691 --> 00:38:05,450
Let's just go ahead and sign this thing.

763
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,916
You want to make me
a partner right now, right here?

764
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:08,993
Why the hell not?

765
00:38:09,012 --> 00:38:10,466
In business, we sleep where we shit.

766
00:38:10,512 --> 00:38:12,767
You're lucky, Doug.
I had my doubts about you.

767
00:38:12,919 --> 00:38:14,879
Cicatrice came up
with some good adjectives.

768
00:38:16,122 --> 00:38:17,166
She did?

769
00:38:18,402 --> 00:38:22,062
- What were they?
- That's between me and Cicatrice.

770
00:38:22,555 --> 00:38:25,065
Come on, right there
on the dotted line.

771
00:38:34,428 --> 00:38:35,687
Let's not do this right now.

772
00:38:35,804 --> 00:38:37,448
You don't want to be
my partner anymore?

773
00:38:37,556 --> 00:38:39,024
Yes. No, I do.

774
00:38:39,189 --> 00:38:41,958
Well, then stop with the sad
sack attitude. Sign the damn thing.

775
00:38:43,049 --> 00:38:46,327
Wait, you're right.
You're right. Better idea.

776
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,788
Let's do it with a toast, huh?

777
00:38:50,713 --> 00:38:53,769
Let the good times roll, huh?

778
00:38:57,449 --> 00:38:58,763
Why'd you get him high?

779
00:38:58,877 --> 00:39:00,214
He'd been sober eight years.

780
00:39:00,472 --> 00:39:02,830
Because he deserved it.
He's a son of a bitch.

781
00:39:04,064 --> 00:39:06,985
And now, Cherien,

782
00:39:08,364 --> 00:39:11,883
The lovely Cicatrice.

783
00:39:12,036 --> 00:39:13,385
All right, now,...

784
00:39:14,077 --> 00:39:17,737
the reason we're all here tonight...

785
00:39:18,504 --> 00:39:19,701
Everybody take a sip.

786
00:39:22,633 --> 00:39:23,724
Not bad.

787
00:39:23,877 --> 00:39:25,613
Doug here is gonna scribble
his signature,

788
00:39:25,784 --> 00:39:30,230
and then the naked dancin' will begin.

789
00:39:31,524 --> 00:39:34,304
There you go, Doug.
Time to sign your life away.

790
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,293
You want to hold the pen, jimbo?

791
00:39:38,601 --> 00:39:39,881
What's that supposed to mean?

792
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,936
It's supposed to mean I should
take the writing utensil and sign.

793
00:39:50,546 --> 00:39:52,341
- Come on, go to it!
- Yes.

794
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:02,841
What the hell you waitin' for?

795
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,519
It's the last page.

796
00:40:09,251 --> 00:40:11,124
Oh, he's fine. He's
fine. He's just kinda

797
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:12,524
savorin' the moment.

798
00:40:12,645 --> 00:40:14,062
When you sign somethin' like this,

799
00:40:14,164 --> 00:40:16,024
you know you've arrived.

800
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,458
Yeah, I'm not sure where, but

801
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,106
you've certainly arrived

802
00:40:20,845 --> 00:40:21,912
at that place.

803
00:40:31,842 --> 00:40:32,886
You okay?

804
00:40:34,414 --> 00:40:35,816
Shit, Doug.

805
00:40:36,153 --> 00:40:38,220
Takin' so long, I'm gettin' dizzy.

806
00:40:39,282 --> 00:40:41,171
Do you know what I mean, Jim?

807
00:40:41,945 --> 00:40:43,341
"Hold the pen"?

808
00:40:45,502 --> 00:40:47,707
I bet you want to hold
my pen, don't you?

809
00:40:54,775 --> 00:40:56,206
Wait. Wait.

810
00:40:58,795 --> 00:41:01,223
What? What'd I say?

811
00:41:06,748 --> 00:41:08,109
Maybe later.

812
00:41:37,409 --> 00:41:39,286
What a horrible dinner party.

813
00:41:41,571 --> 00:41:42,849
Does it matter?

814
00:41:44,873 --> 00:41:46,398
If my husband's gay?

815
00:41:46,887 --> 00:41:48,354
It doesn't matter to me.

816
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:50,231
Well, you're not his wife.

817
00:41:53,063 --> 00:41:55,468
I should run away from here
and never come back.

818
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,597
I thought you loved it here.

819
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:03,099
Well, I love the guard at the gate part.

820
00:42:05,643 --> 00:42:07,876
And I love the way people
can see our houses

821
00:42:08,088 --> 00:42:10,652
From one curve in the
highway way off in the distance.

822
00:42:11,808 --> 00:42:14,212
And when they catch a
glimpse, they say to themselves,

823
00:42:14,611 --> 00:42:17,057
"Who in the hell would
pay two million dollars

824
00:42:17,221 --> 00:42:19,316
Just to have them one of
them stupid mcmansions

825
00:42:19,486 --> 00:42:21,456
up there behind a gate?"

826
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,218
And the answer is...

827
00:42:27,385 --> 00:42:28,734
Every single one of them.

828
00:42:29,016 --> 00:42:30,834
They're green with jealousy.

829
00:42:31,884 --> 00:42:34,054
I love that part.

830
00:42:38,517 --> 00:42:40,899
Can't you just pretend he's straight?

831
00:42:45,327 --> 00:42:47,814
All those alpaca conventions,

832
00:42:48,421 --> 00:42:51,787
Think they were just
about fur quality and leg hairs?

833
00:42:55,019 --> 00:42:57,588
I've been pretending for 18 years, Doug.

834
00:43:03,511 --> 00:43:05,107
Not bad.

835
00:43:23,216 --> 00:43:24,671
Everybody went home,

836
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:28,081
Except for that Hugh guy. He's tweakin'.

837
00:43:32,906 --> 00:43:34,548
This is your family, ain't it?

838
00:43:38,753 --> 00:43:39,879
What does it mean?

839
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:43,372
I don't really want to tell you.

840
00:43:44,926 --> 00:43:47,460
You didn't do too good
with my secrets tonight.

841
00:43:47,894 --> 00:43:49,430
Nobody knows notn'.

842
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:51,890
I'm still disappointed.

843
00:43:52,207 --> 00:43:53,323
In what?

844
00:43:54,307 --> 00:43:55,527
Well, in you.

845
00:43:57,759 --> 00:43:59,495
That is not fair, Dolly.

846
00:43:59,741 --> 00:44:01,665
My life is harder than yours.

847
00:44:02,049 --> 00:44:04,026
It's not easy being alone.

848
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,999
It's not easy being somebody's maid.

849
00:44:07,618 --> 00:44:09,952
Yeah, I know.

850
00:44:15,128 --> 00:44:17,252
I think you should go home now.

851
00:44:19,243 --> 00:44:21,301
You mean I'm not
gonna work for you no more?

852
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:26,099
I can't take care of you.

853
00:44:29,697 --> 00:44:31,633
Barely take care of myself.

854
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:35,029
That's selfish, Dolly.

855
00:44:36,653 --> 00:44:39,340
So I'm just gonna leave
with no money, no nothin'?

856
00:44:40,806 --> 00:44:42,448
You want money?

857
00:44:43,269 --> 00:44:45,029
- I need it.
- How much you want?

858
00:44:45,328 --> 00:44:46,630
How much you got?

859
00:44:57,703 --> 00:44:58,935
That's 2,000.

860
00:45:00,633 --> 00:45:02,275
$2,000?

861
00:45:02,932 --> 00:45:04,433
That's a lot, Dolly.

862
00:45:07,029 --> 00:45:08,061
Thanks.

863
00:45:10,137 --> 00:45:11,803
It's almost midnight.

864
00:45:13,818 --> 00:45:15,155
Clock's busted.

865
00:45:15,422 --> 00:45:17,568
It's always 11:59 around here.

866
00:45:39,398 --> 00:45:40,911
You want some?

867
00:45:52,849 --> 00:45:54,210
I'm tryin' not to.

868
00:45:58,251 --> 00:46:00,644
if you decide you do want some,

869
00:46:00,747 --> 00:46:01,826
I'll just...

870
00:46:06,747 --> 00:46:08,424
Leave it right there for you.

871
00:46:12,163 --> 00:46:13,172
Don't.

872
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:15,248
So stop me then.

873
00:46:19,148 --> 00:46:20,356
I'm gonna go.

874
00:46:20,858 --> 00:46:22,266
Can I have a hug?

875
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:29,380
You know I'm no good at goodbyes,

876
00:46:30,515 --> 00:46:32,450
And I don't want to hug you and

877
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,356
be sad.

878
00:47:10,102 --> 00:47:12,647
Take the money. Leave the I.D.

879
00:47:35,566 --> 00:47:36,926
She left?

880
00:47:38,369 --> 00:47:40,011
Just you and me, Dahlia.

881
00:47:43,504 --> 00:47:45,780
And little mr. Phone happy.

882
00:47:48,061 --> 00:47:49,692
Is that what she was to you,

883
00:47:50,489 --> 00:47:51,627
Drug buddy?

884
00:48:01,703 --> 00:48:03,052
What's he doin', anyway?

885
00:48:05,463 --> 00:48:07,481
Looking for the ghost in the machine.

886
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:11,360
I wanted to be a partner.
I got to be a partner.

887
00:48:11,361 --> 00:48:13,513
There is my partner,
lying on the ground.

888
00:48:14,357 --> 00:48:16,879
Something about it makes
me sick to my stomach.

889
00:48:21,352 --> 00:48:23,534
Well, we're turnin' to buffers, baby.

890
00:48:28,108 --> 00:48:29,141
Ain't we?

891
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:48,074
