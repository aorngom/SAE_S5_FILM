1
00:00:01,309 --> 00:00:02,501
<i>Previously on</i> V...

2
00:00:02,753 --> 00:00:04,157
The Visitors framed you.

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:07,209
Your prints on the bomb
that torched the Lyndhurst warehouse.

4
00:00:07,334 --> 00:00:08,883
Aren't you curious why?

5
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:11,135
It's critical
that we advance our plans.

6
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:13,095
He'll remain
until he's no longer needed.

7
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,305
And then what?

8
00:00:14,434 --> 00:00:16,935
Lisa's changing.
If her feelings and for Tyler are real,

9
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,935
she could be a great asset
for us against Anna.

10
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:21,062
I don't want you to move
onto the ship with me.

11
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,565
- You can go.
- He doesn't want to see me anymore.

12
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,691
We'll have to find
a greater incentive for him.

13
00:00:27,056 --> 00:00:27,985
Break her legs.

14
00:00:48,475 --> 00:00:51,497
Help! I need some help over here!

15
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,483
We've got an assault
on a female Visitor.

16
00:01:03,608 --> 00:01:06,542
She was leaving the peace ambassador
center when two men jumped her,

17
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,767
told her: "5th column doesn't
want you here anymore.

18
00:01:08,892 --> 00:01:11,654
- "Leave or we'll kill all of you."
- Subtle. Suspects?

19
00:01:11,779 --> 00:01:14,625
Not yet. But lucky for us,
she got a good look at her attackers.

20
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,826
A sketch artist is on
his way down right now.

21
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:24,834
Oh, my God.

22
00:01:25,807 --> 00:01:26,877
I know her.

23
00:01:27,493 --> 00:01:29,046
It's my son's girlfriend.

24
00:01:30,261 --> 00:01:31,627
Did you know she's a V?

25
00:01:33,153 --> 00:01:34,153
Does he?

26
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:36,901
I don't know.

27
00:01:44,174 --> 00:01:45,062
Mrs. Evans.

28
00:01:45,927 --> 00:01:46,731
Oh, God.

29
00:01:47,317 --> 00:01:48,315
Oh, sweetheart.

30
00:01:50,415 --> 00:01:51,819
Lisa, I'm so sorry.

31
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:55,156
I don't understand.

32
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,820
Why would someone do this to me?

33
00:01:59,928 --> 00:02:01,078
I don't know.

34
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,247
I'm gonna find out.

35
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:08,386
The men who hurt you...

36
00:02:10,915 --> 00:02:12,715
Did you recognize them
from anywhere?

37
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,013
<i>Break her legs.</i>

38
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,812
It's gonna be okay.

39
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,761
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

40
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,599
It's okay.

41
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,356
It's time to go down
to the healing center, Joshua.

42
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:47,393
My daughter needs
her mother's comfort.

43
00:02:47,518 --> 00:02:49,598
And they still haven't
healed Lisa's injuries.

44
00:02:49,723 --> 00:02:51,275
I'll do so when I arrive.

45
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,812
Heal her legs so she can walk,

46
00:02:54,937 --> 00:02:58,309
but keep the gash and the bruises on
her face until she returns to the ship.

47
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:02,431
I want the whole world to see what
the 5th Column has done to my daughter.

48
00:03:03,344 --> 00:03:05,264
A picture's worth a thousand words.

49
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,604
<i>In breaking news on the story
we've been following all morning,</i>

50
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:19,949
<i>the FBI has released
sketches of two men</i>

51
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:22,326
<i>suspected in the assault
on the Visitor last night.</i>

52
00:03:22,615 --> 00:03:24,578
<i>Authorities are asking
for the public's help</i>

53
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,186
<i>in identifying the two men
who left her for dead.</i>

54
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:29,333
<i>Anybody with any information
regarding this...</i>

55
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:34,421
You see this?

56
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:38,227
<i>At this time, the Visitors have
released no information</i>

57
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:40,094
<i>on the victim or her condition.</i>

58
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:42,389
<i>All we've been told is
that Visitor High Commander Anna</i>

59
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,723
<i>is going to come out
and address the American people</i>

60
00:03:45,047 --> 00:03:48,089
<i>following the alleged assault
against one of her kind this morning.</i>

61
00:03:48,214 --> 00:03:49,980
This the first
you're hearing of this?

62
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,151
I thought you were
the voice of the Vs.

63
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:54,942
What happened? Anna fire you?

64
00:04:03,054 --> 00:04:05,335
Looks like we're gonna have
a full house this morning.

65
00:04:06,305 --> 00:04:08,327
Morning mass doesn't
start for another hour.

66
00:04:08,452 --> 00:04:11,348
There was an attack
on one of the Visitors last night.

67
00:04:11,473 --> 00:04:13,752
They're praying for the Vs soul.

68
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:18,323
Our parishioners spend more time

69
00:04:18,448 --> 00:04:20,812
praying for the Visitors' souls
than they do their own.

70
00:04:20,937 --> 00:04:22,746
If that's troubling to you,
speak to them.

71
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:26,110
- They're looking to connect to you.
- Will they listen, father Travis?

72
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:29,567
They've become
so dependent on the Visitors.

73
00:04:31,255 --> 00:04:33,320
Jack, don't let your own concerns

74
00:04:33,445 --> 00:04:35,900
blind you to the needs
of your parishioners.

75
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,278
They found room in their hearts
for the Visitors.

76
00:04:39,965 --> 00:04:42,573
You try to find room
in your heart as well.

77
00:04:52,078 --> 00:04:55,377
We pulled some mug shots based on the
description Lisa gave our sketch artist.

78
00:04:56,406 --> 00:04:58,073
One of them's our old friend Hobbes.

79
00:05:08,937 --> 00:05:10,768
I have some mug shots to show you.

80
00:05:14,443 --> 00:05:16,251
Are these the men who attacked you?

81
00:05:23,107 --> 00:05:25,128
It's okay. Take your time.

82
00:05:26,751 --> 00:05:27,743
Look carefully.

83
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:31,241
Yes.

84
00:05:33,231 --> 00:05:35,167
Lisa, are you sure?

85
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:50,349
Mother.

86
00:05:54,991 --> 00:05:56,850
What have they done to my daughter?

87
00:05:59,307 --> 00:06:00,609
Sweetheart.

88
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,196
You're gonna be okay.

89
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:06,933
You're safe now.

90
00:06:32,011 --> 00:06:33,961
Most people have embraced us,

91
00:06:35,476 --> 00:06:36,576
welcomed us.

92
00:06:37,588 --> 00:06:39,629
It's astonishing to me

93
00:06:40,037 --> 00:06:42,673
the 5th Column could
cause so much pain...

94
00:06:44,608 --> 00:06:46,321
Terrorize so many people.

95
00:06:50,103 --> 00:06:52,251
There are some twisted people
in our world.

96
00:06:54,391 --> 00:06:55,491
Fortunately,

97
00:06:56,837 --> 00:07:00,058
the majority of humans are kind,
good-hearted.

98
00:07:01,876 --> 00:07:04,955
This is why I never wanted to
make Lisa's identity public.

99
00:07:05,524 --> 00:07:09,428
I was worried she would become a target.
This is exactly what I was afraid of.

100
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:15,017
Lisa identified two men.

101
00:07:17,212 --> 00:07:20,360
Have you ever seen either
of these men before?

102
00:07:30,195 --> 00:07:32,595
Lisa was on her way to see
your son when this happened.

103
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,020
Does Tyler know?

104
00:07:34,736 --> 00:07:38,040
Yes. I called to tell him.
He's very upset.

105
00:07:39,728 --> 00:07:41,251
Lisa's grown very fond of him.

106
00:07:43,582 --> 00:07:46,090
He's lucky he wasn't with her
when this happened.

107
00:07:47,377 --> 00:07:49,718
Yes, he is. He's very lucky.

108
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:51,891
As a mother,

109
00:07:52,726 --> 00:07:55,390
I'm sure you can imagine
how I feel right now.

110
00:07:56,312 --> 00:07:57,912
As a mother, I know...

111
00:07:58,907 --> 00:08:01,307
that if someone tried
to hurt my son,

112
00:08:02,164 --> 00:08:04,313
there's nothing
I wouldn't do to stop them.

113
00:08:06,124 --> 00:08:09,045
Then I'm sure you'll do
whatever you can to find who did this

114
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:11,959
before they hurt
someone else's child.

115
00:08:14,223 --> 00:08:15,223
I will.

116
00:08:15,815 --> 00:08:17,538
You can count on it.

117
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,682
Erica says Lisa identified
you as one of her attackers.

118
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:26,807
Your face...

119
00:08:26,932 --> 00:08:29,675
is all over the news, which is
the last thing we need right now.

120
00:08:30,238 --> 00:08:32,052
It's no picnic for me either, mate.

121
00:08:32,592 --> 00:08:35,716
This is the second time the Visitors
framed you for something you didn't do.

122
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:37,145
Anything you wanna tell us?

123
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,726
I've got no idea
what the Visitors want from me.

124
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,844
I was starting to think it might have
something to do with this other guy,

125
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:46,118
his names Parker.

126
00:08:46,243 --> 00:08:47,276
Why him?

127
00:08:48,164 --> 00:08:51,278
Four weeks ago, before the Visitors
framed me for the first time,

128
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,158
someone hired me to kill him.

129
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:01,623
Our suspects in this morning's attack
are Lawrence Parker and Kyle Hobbes.

130
00:09:01,865 --> 00:09:04,126
Lawrence Parker is
a weapons engineer,

131
00:09:04,483 --> 00:09:06,525
did time as a CIA analyst
in Beijing.

132
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,464
He works for Dorset System labs.

133
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,883
Parker went missing four weeks ago.

134
00:09:11,205 --> 00:09:13,302
He has access to
top secret intelligence.

135
00:09:13,658 --> 00:09:16,883
You talk to Dorset. Did he take
any of his weapons research with him?

136
00:09:17,008 --> 00:09:18,223
Dorset lab says no.

137
00:09:19,947 --> 00:09:22,519
Hobbes is the key. He wouldn't be
involved in a simple assault.

138
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,079
That doesn't match his MO.

139
00:09:24,204 --> 00:09:26,745
I suggest it's all part of
a larger plan that he has,

140
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,377
and I suggest we find Kyle Hobbes.

141
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,020
Hold on.

142
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:36,257
We've been looking for Hobbes
for weeks. No luck.

143
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:39,119
Lawrence Parker is a civilian.
He's a weak link.

144
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,444
We go for Parker, we find him,
we get a shot at Hobbes.

145
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,175
You better be right.
We focus on Parker.

146
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,400
And move it.

147
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:00,373
Do you know any more about Lisa? They
wouldn't let me into the healing center.

148
00:10:00,498 --> 00:10:01,850
I do. She's gonna be okay.

149
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:05,505
I should have told you
that she was a Visitor. I...

150
00:10:06,527 --> 00:10:07,947
You kinda skipped that part.

151
00:10:08,072 --> 00:10:10,693
You're gonna find
the people that did this, right?

152
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,903
I will do everything that I can.

153
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,348
You wanna see her?

154
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,473
Tyler, I didn't want you
to see me like this.

155
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,020
I needed to see you.

156
00:10:45,496 --> 00:10:47,437
I needed to know that you were okay.

157
00:10:54,597 --> 00:10:56,530
I believe we have
some friends in common...

158
00:10:57,296 --> 00:10:58,346
5th Column.

159
00:10:59,674 --> 00:11:01,660
We've spoken on the comms device.

160
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,710
It's nice to see your face.

161
00:11:09,231 --> 00:11:11,837
- Is it safe to talk?
- For a moment.

162
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,863
Listen to me carefully.

163
00:11:14,344 --> 00:11:17,884
The two men Lisa identified
as her assailants, are innocent.

164
00:11:18,492 --> 00:11:20,042
Anna did this to her.

165
00:11:23,494 --> 00:11:25,309
Anna did this to her own daughter?

166
00:11:26,573 --> 00:11:27,573
Why?

167
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:29,315
I don't know.

168
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:32,274
But the two men she identified
have answers.

169
00:11:32,864 --> 00:11:34,564
You need to find them...

170
00:11:34,689 --> 00:11:36,039
before Anna does.

171
00:11:38,557 --> 00:11:41,116
I didn't mean the things
that I said to you yesterday,

172
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,244
about not wanting see you.

173
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:47,066
I do.

174
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,442
Then why did you say them?

175
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:55,328
I was confused

176
00:11:56,451 --> 00:11:57,501
and scared.

177
00:12:00,198 --> 00:12:02,929
I've never had feelings like
this for someone before.

178
00:12:04,218 --> 00:12:05,432
Neither have I.

179
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:12,439
My son is in love with her daughter.
Is he in danger?

180
00:12:13,528 --> 00:12:15,609
At first,
Tyler was just an assignment.

181
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,720
But now I believe
that her feelings for him are real.

182
00:12:21,289 --> 00:12:23,489
I don't think that she'd hurt him.

183
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,094
Lisa, it's time.

184
00:13:27,454 --> 00:13:29,307
What's going on?
Why can't I reach Anna?

185
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,601
I'm sorry, Mr. Decker.
She's been indisposed.

186
00:13:32,016 --> 00:13:33,066
Indisposed?

187
00:13:34,016 --> 00:13:36,325
A Visitor being attacked
is a delicate story.

188
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,275
You're gonna need
my help to control it.

189
00:13:38,671 --> 00:13:41,736
Thank you, Mr. Decker,
but we already have it under control.

190
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:54,387
Don't look at the cameras.
Don't make eye contact with anyone.

191
00:13:55,288 --> 00:13:56,288
Why not?

192
00:13:56,955 --> 00:13:59,394
The less you give them,
the more they want.

193
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,541
Why are we cutting
Mr. Decker off from us?

194
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,104
We'll bring him back
when the timing is right.

195
00:14:25,227 --> 00:14:27,866
I come to you today
with a heavy heart.

196
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,079
A terrible hate crime has been
committed against one of my people.

197
00:14:33,646 --> 00:14:36,446
Members of a terrorist group,
the 5th Column,

198
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,919
have brutally assaulted
a member of my family,

199
00:14:39,568 --> 00:14:40,868
my own daughter,

200
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,214
Lisa.

201
00:14:55,448 --> 00:14:57,148
Despite our best efforts

202
00:14:57,488 --> 00:15:00,788
to demonstrate our care
and concern for the human race,

203
00:15:01,396 --> 00:15:03,276
to improve life on your planet,

204
00:15:04,624 --> 00:15:07,074
<i>to share our resources
and technology,</i>

205
00:15:08,224 --> 00:15:10,174
<i>asking for nothing in return,</i>

206
00:15:11,852 --> 00:15:13,602
<i>there are those among you</i>

207
00:15:13,814 --> 00:15:15,314
<i>who wish to harm us.</i>

208
00:15:17,221 --> 00:15:19,376
<i>In the wake of yesterday's
shuttle disaster</i>

209
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,994
<i>and this brutal assault
on my daughter,</i>

210
00:15:22,983 --> 00:15:25,131
<i>my people no longer feel safe here.</i>

211
00:15:26,304 --> 00:15:28,254
So I have come to a decision.

212
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:32,973
We are leaving.

213
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,825
- Anna's lying. They're never leaving.
- Then why make the announcement?

214
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,797
It's theater.
You know, the boo-ho,

215
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,717
the attack on the princess?
She's putting on a show.

216
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,185
Hobbes is right.

217
00:16:10,711 --> 00:16:12,954
Anna could have
healed Lisa's wounds,

218
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:15,343
but instead, she left
them for the world to see.

219
00:16:15,468 --> 00:16:16,968
The question is why?

220
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,561
What is her interest
in you and Parker?

221
00:16:19,827 --> 00:16:22,277
- I don't know.
- We need to find out.

222
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,609
Joshua said that Anna is the one
who beat Lisa, slashed her face.

223
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:28,153
- She broke her legs.
- Wait. Anna did that?

224
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,421
- How could she do that?
- Because she's a Visitor.

225
00:16:31,815 --> 00:16:34,159
There's nothing that she won't
do to get what she wants.

226
00:16:34,687 --> 00:16:37,687
Whatever Parker knows
is important enough to Anna

227
00:16:37,812 --> 00:16:40,999
that she would hurt her own child
to engage our sympathies.

228
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,293
And also get the FBI
to help find them.

229
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,378
We want answers, we find Parker.

230
00:16:46,095 --> 00:16:47,589
Or we could ask your son.

231
00:16:50,324 --> 00:16:52,782
I mean, you said
they have a thing going.

232
00:16:52,907 --> 00:16:55,597
Maybe the lizard princess told him
something that could help us.

233
00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:00,810
I will not bring Tyler into this.
I will not use him.

234
00:17:01,435 --> 00:17:02,896
Reconsider this, Erica.

235
00:17:03,795 --> 00:17:06,858
I kept the truth from Val,
and look where it's got me.

236
00:17:07,802 --> 00:17:10,070
Anna's already using Tyler
in this war.

237
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,489
Bringing him in may be
the best way to protect him.

238
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,407
You saw what she did to her kid.

239
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:18,143
Now if she's capable of that,
imagine what she could do to your son.

240
00:17:21,388 --> 00:17:23,375
Use your contacts to find Parker.

241
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,002
Ryan and Jack
will follow up on your leads.

242
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:32,312
You're public enemy
number one, Hobbes.

243
00:17:32,437 --> 00:17:34,479
You got cojones
showing your face around here.

244
00:17:34,604 --> 00:17:38,030
Frame me once, shame on you.
Frame me twice, shame on me.

245
00:17:38,881 --> 00:17:41,184
Four weeks ago, someone
hired me to kill Parker.

246
00:17:41,714 --> 00:17:43,231
My employer didn't check out.

247
00:17:43,356 --> 00:17:46,262
Fake name, fake social,
didn't pass the smell test.

248
00:17:46,508 --> 00:17:48,861
- I figured something wasn't kosher.
- You were right.

249
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:51,504
I tried to track down the guy
who hired you, but I couldn't.

250
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:52,988
I was luckier with Parker.

251
00:17:53,514 --> 00:17:56,135
He's been holed up in a Chinatown
walk-up since he went missing.

252
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,122
You were able to find out what he was
working on at Dorset Systems?

253
00:17:59,247 --> 00:18:01,526
- No. No luck.
- Well, whatever it is,

254
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:04,752
the Visitors, the FBI...
they want it bad,

255
00:18:05,402 --> 00:18:07,995
and now they're framing us
for the assault on Anna's kid.

256
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,720
- What are you gonna do?
- Get my hands on it before they do.

257
00:19:04,466 --> 00:19:06,811
It took my contacts longer
than I thought, but finally,

258
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,461
- <i>they got the 4-1-1 on Parker.</i>
- Where?

259
00:19:09,586 --> 00:19:10,586
<i>Chinatown,</i>

260
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,992
apartment across the street
from the Jade Kitchen on Pell.

261
00:19:14,117 --> 00:19:15,217
<i>Apartment 3.</i>

262
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:16,446
Good work.

263
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:18,261
My pleasure.

264
00:19:27,785 --> 00:19:31,246
I need to see Anna right now.
Why isn't she returning my calls?

265
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:34,628
I'm sorry, Chad, but dealing with the
attack of her daughter and coordinating

266
00:19:34,753 --> 00:19:37,801
our withdrawal from your planet has
left her little time for anything else.

267
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:40,553
You're not really leaving.
I don't believe that.

268
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,474
Unfortunately, we have no choice.
The 5th Column is too much of a threat.

269
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,810
- Maybe I can help.
- I wish you could,

270
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:48,928
but you're just a journalist.

271
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:52,339
You're underestimating
my influence, Marcus.

272
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:54,234
My audience listens to me.

273
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:57,455
I could reach out to them.
I could have them put pressure

274
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,365
on our government to go after
the 5th Column and help keep you here.

275
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:03,159
Your job is to report the news,
Mr. Decker,

276
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:05,245
not to editorialize.

277
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:08,294
Speaking out on the air
could cost you that job.

278
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:10,291
Are you really willing
to take that risk?

279
00:20:20,947 --> 00:20:22,003
As you predicted,

280
00:20:22,128 --> 00:20:24,243
Mr. Decker is concerned
about our leaving.

281
00:20:24,368 --> 00:20:25,168
Good.

282
00:20:25,376 --> 00:20:28,101
I need him to be desperate,
to be convincing.

283
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:30,937
He's always done.
Why does he need convincing?

284
00:20:31,727 --> 00:20:34,488
It's not Chad who needs convincing.
It's his audience,

285
00:20:34,613 --> 00:20:36,151
and only he can speak to them.

286
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,028
His fear of losing us
will fuel his passion.

287
00:20:39,496 --> 00:20:41,945
That passion will
generate a public outcry,

288
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,908
and we'll get what we want.

289
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:50,033
Tell the Captain of the Shanghai ship
to leave immediately.

290
00:21:17,918 --> 00:21:21,268
<i>Just minutes ago, the first ship
left Shanghai, China...</i>

291
00:21:21,393 --> 00:21:24,413
the first in Anna's planned
weeklong withdrawal

292
00:21:24,613 --> 00:21:26,284
and shutdown of all V services,

293
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,079
<i>sending waves of protest
and outcry across the world.</i>

294
00:21:30,483 --> 00:21:32,998
<i>London, Moscow, Rio...</i>

295
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:35,609
<i>people everywhere
reacting to the fact</i>

296
00:21:35,734 --> 00:21:38,129
<i>that when they leave,
the Visitors will take with them</i>

297
00:21:38,371 --> 00:21:40,673
<i>their many gifts to humanity.</i>

298
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,591
<i>It is my job
to report the news objectively.</i>

299
00:21:43,882 --> 00:21:45,603
<i>Today, I can't sit back</i>

300
00:21:45,728 --> 00:21:48,089
<i>and pretend I don't have an opinion,
because I do.</i>

301
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:50,037
<i>The Vs saved my life.</i>

302
00:21:50,521 --> 00:21:52,778
<i>We, the people, must fix this.</i>

303
00:21:53,637 --> 00:21:55,768
<i>If you care about your future,</i>

304
00:21:56,377 --> 00:21:58,089
<i>the health of your children,</i>

305
00:21:58,214 --> 00:22:00,985
<i>a world made safe
and peaceful by technology,</i>

306
00:22:01,514 --> 00:22:04,528
<i>now is the time.
Let your voice be heard.</i>

307
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:07,881
<i>Show the world
how much Anna means to you.</i>

308
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:09,827
<i>Show our elected officials</i>

309
00:22:10,221 --> 00:22:13,122
<i>that you want Anna
and the Visitors to stay.</i>

310
00:22:20,628 --> 00:22:22,842
Hobbes says Parker
is bunking in that walk-up.

311
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,385
Keep your eyes out for him.

312
00:22:29,528 --> 00:22:31,000
Ryan, you've been...

313
00:22:31,245 --> 00:22:32,558
Different since Val left.

314
00:22:34,007 --> 00:22:36,312
I remember John May saying
that emotion was a good thing,

315
00:22:36,832 --> 00:22:38,564
it was worth fighting for.

316
00:22:38,898 --> 00:22:40,575
I don't think he was right anymore.

317
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,921
Val has changed me.

318
00:22:45,258 --> 00:22:47,115
She allowed me
to see the beauty in humanity.

319
00:22:48,484 --> 00:22:50,039
It was her love that enabled me

320
00:22:50,164 --> 00:22:51,964
to fight off Anna's bliss.

321
00:22:53,283 --> 00:22:55,623
But without her, I just don't think
I can do it anymore.

322
00:22:56,329 --> 00:22:58,179
None of us knows if we can.

323
00:22:59,603 --> 00:23:01,547
But with faith we can,

324
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,047
and with faith, we do.

325
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,893
That's all you can do, Ryan.
That's all any of us can do.

326
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:20,213
Everything okay?

327
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:27,133
That's Parker.

328
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,050
I'm gonna go check it out.

329
00:23:36,175 --> 00:23:38,030
Cover front and back,
in case he bolts.

330
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,978
Be careful, okay?

331
00:23:44,035 --> 00:23:45,085
Dr. Parker?

332
00:23:45,565 --> 00:23:46,365
FBI.

333
00:23:47,477 --> 00:23:49,264
Look, I know you're scared.

334
00:23:50,561 --> 00:23:51,888
I want to help you.

335
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,940
I'm Erica.

336
00:23:59,139 --> 00:24:01,564
Whatever the Visitors are saying,
I didn't. I'm innocent.

337
00:24:02,082 --> 00:24:04,677
I believe you. If you're innocent,
why are you running?

338
00:24:04,802 --> 00:24:06,569
Because whoever
is after me found me.

339
00:24:07,542 --> 00:24:10,281
Someone broke into my hard drive
and stole all my research.

340
00:24:11,103 --> 00:24:12,647
I need a better place to hide.

341
00:24:13,431 --> 00:24:15,241
You disappeared four weeks ago.
Why?

342
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:16,829
Someone came after me.

343
00:24:17,258 --> 00:24:19,412
I thought it was related
to the work I was doing.

344
00:24:19,537 --> 00:24:22,074
- it could have been the Vs?
- They must have had some reason

345
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:24,677
- to have framed you.
- Why would they be interested in me?

346
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:28,038
- What were you doing for dorset?
- Myself and a few of my colleagues

347
00:24:28,163 --> 00:24:30,760
- we run an informal online think tank.
- And?

348
00:24:32,176 --> 00:24:36,177
We've been working on an compound
to slow down the global warming,

349
00:24:36,302 --> 00:24:38,727
but it didn't work.
We had problematic side effects.

350
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,830
- What were the side effects?
- Algae. It infected marine life,

351
00:24:42,955 --> 00:24:45,936
caused a virus on the skin of fish,
turtles, other amphibians.

352
00:24:46,061 --> 00:24:48,528
- We abandoned the project.
- What about reptiles, lizards?

353
00:24:48,837 --> 00:24:49,654
Possibly.

354
00:24:50,778 --> 00:24:52,198
Was the virus deadly?

355
00:24:52,856 --> 00:24:55,373
- Potentially. That's why we stopped.
- Okay.

356
00:24:55,498 --> 00:24:57,537
Dr. Parker,
this is really important.

357
00:24:57,705 --> 00:25:00,540
How much of this still exists?
Do you have the formula for it?

358
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:03,336
Yes, but I worked on one component
of the project.

359
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:05,461
We worked separately,
in case it was compromised.

360
00:25:05,691 --> 00:25:07,338
It'd be useless without us.

361
00:25:07,774 --> 00:25:10,508
My research is gone.
Whoever took the hard drive has it.

362
00:25:18,034 --> 00:25:18,834
Yeah.

363
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:21,310
Get out of there, Erica.
The FBI's here.

364
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,303
Okay, you and Ryan leave now. Go.

365
00:25:23,824 --> 00:25:24,964
I'll figure it out.

366
00:25:25,569 --> 00:25:26,635
All right, Larry.

367
00:25:26,861 --> 00:25:29,360
I need the names of the people
working in the think tank.

368
00:25:29,725 --> 00:25:30,725
All right.

369
00:25:43,461 --> 00:25:44,625
Thank you, Larry.

370
00:25:47,524 --> 00:25:49,755
I am going to do everything
in my power to help you.

371
00:25:50,117 --> 00:25:52,592
And I'm sorry.
This is gonna hurt a little bit.

372
00:26:01,746 --> 00:26:04,103
I was just about to call.
What are you doing here?

373
00:26:04,695 --> 00:26:08,274
We got a tip from a restaurant owner:
Parker's been in and out for weeks.

374
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:10,359
- What are you doing here?
- I got the same tip.

375
00:26:10,739 --> 00:26:11,819
Nice work, Evans.

376
00:26:18,018 --> 00:26:20,532
Lawrence Parker, you're under arrest
for the attempted murder

377
00:26:20,657 --> 00:26:22,455
of the Visitor known as Lisa.

378
00:26:51,045 --> 00:26:53,139
I just got off the phone
with Washington.

379
00:26:53,264 --> 00:26:54,986
The Visitors aren't going anywhere.

380
00:26:55,384 --> 00:26:57,996
The government offered them our help
in stopping 5th Column.

381
00:26:58,121 --> 00:26:59,780
They will share their technology,

382
00:26:59,905 --> 00:27:02,286
and in return, we will share our
intel on terrorists.

383
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,330
I don't think that's a good idea.
Do you?

384
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:07,927
It doesn't matter what I think.
This gets back to the president.

385
00:27:08,052 --> 00:27:10,541
I have been instructed
to form a joint task force,

386
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:13,714
and we will work together with
the Visitors to eradicate 5th Column.

387
00:27:14,489 --> 00:27:17,544
Also, effective immediately,
any suspects with chargeable cases

388
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:19,935
will be remanded to the Vs
for questioning before trial,

389
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,165
starting with our friend
Mr. Parker there.

390
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:27,705
I just ran a search
on all the scientists

391
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:30,231
in Parker's think tank.
<i>All</i> of them were reported missing.

392
00:27:30,592 --> 00:27:31,801
Anna's got to them.

393
00:27:32,182 --> 00:27:34,777
Parker's the only missing piece,
and she's about to get to him, too.

394
00:27:35,122 --> 00:27:36,183
She can't.

395
00:27:36,308 --> 00:27:38,244
We lose Parker,
we lose our only chance

396
00:27:38,369 --> 00:27:39,615
to recover his research.

397
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,591
And whatever the Visitors
are so afraid of.

398
00:27:41,716 --> 00:27:43,077
<i>We still have a shot.</i>

399
00:27:43,608 --> 00:27:46,247
Lisa is on her way down
to identify Parker.

400
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:47,748
Maybe I can get by her.

401
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,419
Erica, are you sure about this?
Manipulating Lisa, using her?

402
00:27:51,706 --> 00:27:54,213
It might put you on Anna's radar.
It could put Tyler at risk.

403
00:27:54,748 --> 00:27:56,445
If she's going to use my son,

404
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:59,130
then I'm sure as hell
gonna use her daughter.

405
00:28:02,445 --> 00:28:03,472
They're here.

406
00:28:13,737 --> 00:28:15,422
May I speak with Lisa for a moment?

407
00:28:15,547 --> 00:28:18,871
Confronting one's attacker
can be very unsettling.

408
00:28:18,996 --> 00:28:20,406
I would like to prep her first.

409
00:28:21,303 --> 00:28:22,853
Of course. Thank you.

410
00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:26,589
This way.

411
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,448
I want you to have this.

412
00:28:39,824 --> 00:28:40,801
What's this for?

413
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:43,596
I want you to take it
into the lineup with you.

414
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:45,723
Why?

415
00:28:47,045 --> 00:28:49,853
Holding on to something
that makes you feel safe

416
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,270
gives you strength.

417
00:28:52,496 --> 00:28:53,314
Trust me.

418
00:29:01,256 --> 00:29:02,564
Listen to me...

419
00:29:03,132 --> 00:29:04,408
very carefully.

420
00:29:05,002 --> 00:29:06,978
This man's fate and a whole lot more

421
00:29:07,103 --> 00:29:10,289
relies on you're telling the truth
about who hurt you.

422
00:29:11,789 --> 00:29:14,659
You cannot condemn an innocent man.

423
00:29:16,233 --> 00:29:19,285
You need to be 100% sure.

424
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:23,010
Mrs. Evans...

425
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,014
What I said about those two men...

426
00:29:28,944 --> 00:29:30,309
It's time, my daughter.

427
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:36,399
Okay.

428
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:43,198
Lisa, remember, you can see them.

429
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:44,776
They can't see you.

430
00:29:46,487 --> 00:29:47,281
Okay?

431
00:29:52,063 --> 00:29:53,285
Take your time

432
00:29:53,522 --> 00:29:55,876
and remember what we talked about.

433
00:30:07,738 --> 00:30:08,741
I'm here.

434
00:30:09,412 --> 00:30:12,236
There's nothing to fear anymore.

435
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,519
It's him.

436
00:30:46,056 --> 00:30:47,209
Are you sure?

437
00:30:49,861 --> 00:30:50,832
Positive.

438
00:31:09,254 --> 00:31:10,594
Thank you, Agent Evans.

439
00:31:11,088 --> 00:31:13,414
You have no idea
how much this means to me.

440
00:31:13,699 --> 00:31:14,782
Of course.

441
00:31:20,543 --> 00:31:24,356
- What will you do with him?
- Question him about his collaborators.

442
00:31:24,481 --> 00:31:27,571
Hopefully, he'll lead us to
his accomplice, and other 5th Column.

443
00:31:28,042 --> 00:31:32,046
I want you to know that stopping
the 5th Column is my top priority.

444
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:35,082
Then I'm sure we'll
cross paths again soon.

445
00:31:35,682 --> 00:31:37,353
I'm not going anywhere, Anna.

446
00:31:38,257 --> 00:31:40,388
As of this evening, neither am I.

447
00:31:46,986 --> 00:31:48,343
It's Kyle Hobbes.

448
00:31:48,701 --> 00:31:50,740
Apparently, you've
been looking for me.

449
00:31:51,404 --> 00:31:52,738
But surprise, surprise.

450
00:31:52,863 --> 00:31:55,272
Looks like I found what
you're really looking for.

451
00:31:56,765 --> 00:31:58,415
I've got Parker's research.

452
00:31:59,221 --> 00:32:00,505
The question is...

453
00:32:01,411 --> 00:32:03,062
How much is it worth to you?

454
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:08,051
Protests turning to celebration tonight
as New York City residents rejoice

455
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,204
<i>in Anna's decision to stay.</i>

456
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:12,580
<i>Many citing that heartfelt
public appeal</i>

457
00:32:12,705 --> 00:32:14,330
<i>by reporter, Chad Decker,</i>

458
00:32:14,455 --> 00:32:17,556
<i>as being a key element in driving
public sentiments.</i>

459
00:32:25,364 --> 00:32:27,066
I tried to reach you all day.

460
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:28,740
I'm sorry, Chad.

461
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:32,570
I've had other things on my
mind today besides Chad Decker.

462
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:36,072
Your report created quite an uproar.

463
00:32:36,552 --> 00:32:38,742
Thanks to you, we're staying.

464
00:32:42,111 --> 00:32:45,254
You shut me out purposefully
today to get me to make a plea,

465
00:32:46,914 --> 00:32:49,468
to push public opinion,
to rally for you to stay,

466
00:32:49,807 --> 00:32:50,807
didn't you?

467
00:32:51,953 --> 00:32:54,375
My only interest is the
protection of my people.

468
00:32:55,956 --> 00:32:59,615
Thankfully, your government agreed
to help ensure their safety.

469
00:33:02,697 --> 00:33:04,000
I was hoping...

470
00:33:04,752 --> 00:33:06,379
Maybe you could help me, too.

471
00:33:06,926 --> 00:33:07,776
How?

472
00:33:08,473 --> 00:33:10,252
I need to stop the 5th Column.

473
00:33:10,808 --> 00:33:13,157
You can start by giving me
the name of your source,

474
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:16,003
the one that tipped you off
about the shuttle crash.

475
00:33:16,445 --> 00:33:19,538
That would be a breach of
my ethics as a journalist.

476
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,450
You've crossed that line once today.

477
00:33:25,475 --> 00:33:27,828
Crossing it a second time
shouldn't be that difficult.

478
00:33:30,296 --> 00:33:32,749
I'm only looking out for
what's best for both of us.

479
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,568
Something's off with you.

480
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,122
- And that worries me.
- Yeah?

481
00:33:46,226 --> 00:33:48,400
Since when do you worry about
anyone else but yourself?

482
00:33:50,475 --> 00:33:53,387
My only worry is that
you stay focused on your game.

483
00:33:54,003 --> 00:33:55,741
Anything less could get us killed.

484
00:33:56,874 --> 00:33:58,078
I'm on my game.

485
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:00,719
You stay on yours.

486
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:14,122
When special ops soldiers go to war,

487
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:17,429
they don't carry any
family mementos,

488
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,965
no photos, nothing.

489
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,274
You know why?

490
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:24,019
'Cause they can be taken from
you and used against you.

491
00:34:25,218 --> 00:34:27,199
The Vs hit you where it hurt.

492
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,084
You fell in love,

493
00:34:30,865 --> 00:34:32,236
and now she's gone.

494
00:34:32,607 --> 00:34:35,956
And that pain you're feeling,
the human emotions...

495
00:34:36,435 --> 00:34:38,707
they will use them against you.

496
00:34:40,574 --> 00:34:41,628
In war,

497
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:45,191
emotions can get you killed.

498
00:34:45,947 --> 00:34:47,030
Bury them.

499
00:34:48,111 --> 00:34:50,321
Leave your feelings foher behind.

500
00:34:50,446 --> 00:34:53,257
Burn any trace of them
out of your heart.

501
00:35:05,126 --> 00:35:06,770
The eggs are about to hatch.

502
00:35:07,951 --> 00:35:09,932
My army will be born soon.

503
00:35:13,424 --> 00:35:15,462
You did an excellent job today

504
00:35:15,968 --> 00:35:18,498
with the FBI and with Tyler.

505
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,505
As head of the 5th
Column task force,

506
00:35:21,904 --> 00:35:24,327
Tyler's mother is our
most important asset

507
00:35:24,804 --> 00:35:26,206
against the 5th Column.

508
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:29,835
I will keep her close,

509
00:35:30,248 --> 00:35:33,672
make her believe, like Tyler,
that my feelings for her are real.

510
00:35:34,317 --> 00:35:35,329
Good.

511
00:35:55,552 --> 00:35:57,904
If my mother's eggs
are allowed to hatch,

512
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:01,950
those soldiers will destroy
the 5th Column, won't they?

513
00:36:05,251 --> 00:36:06,497
Yes, they will.

514
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,358
<i>Federal authorities announced</i>
<i>the arrest tonight</i>

515
00:36:14,483 --> 00:36:17,569
<i>of a suspect in the assault
on high commander Anna's daughter.</i>

516
00:36:17,694 --> 00:36:20,640
<i>The suspect, lawree Parker,

<i>led by Agent Erica evans of the FBI.</i>

519
00:36:26,253 --> 00:36:29,864
<i>Parker, a weapons designer
for dorset systems labs in Westchester,</i>

520
00:36:29,989 --> 00:36:32,815
<i>disappeared weeks ago and emerged
just this morning</i>

521
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:35,849
<i>- as one of two suspects in the attack.</i>
- You're a hero.

522
00:36:36,762 --> 00:36:38,175
So I've heard.

523
00:36:41,393 --> 00:36:42,601
I meant to me.

524
00:36:45,309 --> 00:36:46,917
That guy Parker...

525
00:36:47,567 --> 00:36:50,314
you caught him and you put him away,

526
00:36:51,101 --> 00:36:52,549
and that means a lot.

527
00:36:53,986 --> 00:36:55,003
Thanks, mom.

528
00:37:02,218 --> 00:37:03,073
And...

529
00:37:04,338 --> 00:37:07,200
I just want to make sure that...

530
00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:11,979
You're okay with me dating a V.

531
00:37:14,052 --> 00:37:16,367
It's a little weird. Not gonna lie.

532
00:37:17,957 --> 00:37:19,120
I'll deal.

533
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,238
Thanks.

534
00:37:28,025 --> 00:37:29,121
Ty, wait.

535
00:37:36,091 --> 00:37:38,836
I was wrong about the Visitors.

536
00:37:40,101 --> 00:37:41,133
You were right.

537
00:37:43,647 --> 00:37:47,216
I'd like to get to know Lisa better
and Anna, too...

538
00:37:48,858 --> 00:37:50,309
If that's okay with you.

539
00:37:51,241 --> 00:37:52,905
Yeah, it's okay.

540
00:37:55,094 --> 00:37:56,326
I'd like that.

541
00:38:06,758 --> 00:38:10,110
The fleet you sent from our home planet
will enter the solar system soon.

542
00:38:10,235 --> 00:38:13,376
It won't be long until they'll
be within human radar range.

543
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:14,960
We'll piggyback our software

544
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:17,557
into their law enforcement
and military computers,

545
00:38:17,682 --> 00:38:21,078
disable their radar so they
can't detect our ships.

546
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,133
They'll see what we want
them to see, nothing more.

547
00:38:24,258 --> 00:38:28,262
Fear of the 5th Column is spreading
like wildfire throughout the 29 ships.

548
00:38:28,935 --> 00:38:31,773
I've nevereen such worry in them.

549
00:38:32,896 --> 00:38:35,917
They just need their queen
to assuage their fears.

550
00:38:41,183 --> 00:38:44,076
Take comfort knowing I am here.

551
00:38:45,266 --> 00:38:47,047
There is nothing to fear.

552
00:38:48,764 --> 00:38:50,788
We will remain among humans.

553
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,993
<i>But the 5th column
will never harm you.</i>

554
00:38:57,107 --> 00:38:59,962
<i>The past is gone.</i>

555
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:01,901
<i>No looming fate,</i>

556
00:39:02,594 --> 00:39:04,747
<i>no uncontrollable destiny,</i>

557
00:39:05,412 --> 00:39:06,843
<i>no fear,</i>

558
00:39:07,729 --> 00:39:09,161
<i>no looking back.</i>

559
00:39:17,784 --> 00:39:19,879
<i>Bask in my light.</i>

560
00:39:22,009 --> 00:39:24,611
<i>Take comfort knowing I am here,</i>

561
00:39:26,747 --> 00:39:28,866
<i>protecting you from harm.</i>

562
00:39:29,176 --> 00:39:30,746
<i>You are not alone.</i>

563
00:39:31,491 --> 00:39:34,182
You will never be alone.

564
00:40:14,957 --> 00:40:17,914
Gutsy move, showing your
face in public, Mr. Hobbes.

565
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:22,566
What's to stop me from killing you?

566
00:40:23,602 --> 00:40:25,931
'Cause I've got Parker's research,

567
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:29,556
and you wouldn't be here if that didn't
frighten the hell out of you.

568
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:31,303
Where is it?

569
00:40:31,825 --> 00:40:33,972
It's not here. Somewhere safe.

570
00:40:35,593 --> 00:40:37,934
Unless, of course,
I don't get what I want.

571
00:40:39,207 --> 00:40:40,854
I want that research.

572
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:43,004
And you can have it, chief,

573
00:40:43,562 --> 00:40:45,729
and all for the low, low price

574
00:40:45,854 --> 00:40:48,320
of everything the
Visitors have on me,

575
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,614
a clean slate

576
00:40:51,475 --> 00:40:53,960
and one hell of a
big pile of dollars.

577
00:40:55,021 --> 00:40:55,786
Deal?

578
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:20,208
