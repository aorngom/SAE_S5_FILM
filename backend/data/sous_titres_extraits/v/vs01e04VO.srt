1
00:00:01,618 --> 00:00:03,044
It's a day of high emotion,

2
00:00:03,212 --> 00:00:04,920
as we open our doors to a nation

3
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,714
from beyond our imaginations.

4
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:09,302
The captains of all 29 ships
are present.

5
00:00:09,427 --> 00:00:12,553
The visitors didn't just get here.
They've been here for years.

6
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:16,859
There's others out there like me.
We'll help.

7
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:20,102
There were hundreds of images
being captured by the damn jackets.

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,230
- Why don't they just annihilate us?
- They need us for something.

9
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,691
We want to provide
complete medical services

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:26,587
to all.

11
00:00:26,712 --> 00:00:28,277
John May started the 5th Column...

12
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,863
The first group of V
to ever turn against the leadership.

13
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,309
The 5th column says "Hello".

14
00:00:33,434 --> 00:00:35,495
- Georgie, this is Erica.
- I brought a friend.

15
00:00:35,917 --> 00:00:36,661
Hello.

16
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,288
Tyler's the one. You should use him.

17
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,106
You're doing an excellent job.

18
00:00:41,231 --> 00:00:42,416
Thank you, mother.

19
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:55,012
Georgie.

20
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:11,251
I feel like I've been doing
a lot of talking.

21
00:01:12,134 --> 00:01:13,404
Sorry about that.

22
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:17,654
No, it's okay. We're grateful. You know
so much more about the V's than we do.

23
00:01:17,779 --> 00:01:19,409
Been doing this a long time.

24
00:01:20,518 --> 00:01:23,369
They came after me when
I first found out about them.

25
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:26,035
I got away. My family didn't.

26
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:28,060
Jack told me.

27
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:29,654
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:34,272 --> 00:01:36,053
How do you know so much about them?

29
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:43,018
Been doing this even longer
than Georgie.

30
00:01:46,135 --> 00:01:47,648
We all know why we're here.

31
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,777
We need to hit them back
for what they did to us.

32
00:01:52,568 --> 00:01:54,895
We don't have enough people
to hit anyone back.

33
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,825
We don't need a lot of people.

34
00:01:57,418 --> 00:01:59,285
We just need
to get our hands on a V.

35
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:01,370
Then what?

36
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:04,665
Then we cut it open

37
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,917
and we show the world
what's underneath.

38
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:10,713
If we do that, they got
no choice but to retaliate.

39
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,383
That's just a war we can't win.

40
00:02:14,749 --> 00:02:16,010
They'd wipe us out.

41
00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:19,972
Georgie, no one's backing down,

42
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,057
but we must be smart
about how we fight.

43
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:24,509
You didn't answer
my question before.

44
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:28,773
How do you know so much
about the V's?

45
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:36,398
You got nothing
to worry about with Ryan.

46
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,824
He saved my ass at the warehouse.

47
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,207
If it wasn't for him,
I'd be dead right now.

48
00:02:55,927 --> 00:02:57,135
Why?

49
00:02:58,043 --> 00:03:01,305
Why didn't you just tell them
that you're a V?

50
00:03:01,893 --> 00:03:04,918
It's a priest and an FBI agent.
You can't trust them?

51
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:06,792
What is wrong with you?

52
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:10,153
I better not ever hear you talk
about skinning a V again.

53
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,705
His name was Dale Maddox,
a sleeper agent

54
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,359
we had installed
in the New York FBI office.

55
00:03:29,882 --> 00:03:32,988
And you're telling me
he was murdered aboard my ship?

56
00:03:34,674 --> 00:03:36,358
In the medical bay.

57
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,771
We've never had a murder
any of our ships.

58
00:03:38,896 --> 00:03:40,376
Who would do such a thing?

59
00:03:40,613 --> 00:03:42,430
There are rumors of traitors
aboard...

60
00:03:43,351 --> 00:03:44,306
5th column.

61
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,101
We can't afford any kind
of dissonance among our people.

62
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,093
Assemble a team immediately
and find out who did this.

63
00:04:26,344 --> 00:04:27,539
Hi, sweetheart.

64
00:04:28,734 --> 00:04:29,779
You working?

65
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:36,058
Can I talk to you for a minute?

66
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,652
Absolutely.
Can you give me two minutes?

67
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,840
<i>Than the visitors
high commander, Anna.</i>

68
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,551
<i>You have some exciting news
to share with us today.</i>

69
00:05:03,132 --> 00:05:06,057
<i>We do, Chad. We're announcing
a new program that will spread </i>

70
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:08,908
<i>the miracles of our healing centers
to countless people.</i>

71
00:05:09,381 --> 00:05:11,131
Do you know when she'll be back?

72
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,356
Well, is there another doctor
I can see?

73
00:05:16,745 --> 00:05:19,098
No, it's all right.
Yeah, thanks anyway.

74
00:05:20,392 --> 00:05:23,075
- You all right?
- I feel like crap.

75
00:05:23,922 --> 00:05:26,158
There's that nasty bug
that's going around.

76
00:05:26,847 --> 00:05:30,139
No, it's these meds.
They're making me so tired.

77
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:33,432
I'm trying to get 'em changed, but
Dr. Soder's out of town till next week.

78
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:36,310
- Maybe I should just stop taking them.
- No.

79
00:05:36,572 --> 00:05:38,545
You can't just stop
taking heart medication.

80
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:39,615
I know.

81
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,262
I'll be fine.

82
00:05:41,387 --> 00:05:43,509
I've just got
a couple of clients today.

83
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:45,578
Okay.

84
00:05:47,112 --> 00:05:49,589
- You need anything, let me know, okay?
- I will.

85
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:52,004
- Love you.
- I love you.

86
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,475
<i>Which brings me</i>
<i>to today's announcement.</i>

87
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,424
<i>Our physicians are able to treat
a number of human ailments,</i>

88
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,265
<i>but preventative medicine
is also important.</i>

89
00:06:03,052 --> 00:06:06,373
<i>We've developed an injection...
Call it a vitamin supplement</i>

90
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,977
<i>designed to strengthen
the immune system.</i>

91
00:06:09,427 --> 00:06:12,452
<i>Not just strengthen it, I'm told,
but supercharge it.</i>

92
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,916
<i>To help fight off numerous forms
of cancer, other diseases</i>

93
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,353
<i>even stave off the effects of aging.</i>

94
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:19,655
<i>All true.</i>

95
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,277
<i>We'll be offering
the injections around the clock</i>

96
00:06:22,402 --> 00:06:24,692
<i>at our healing centers
in the days to come.</i>

97
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:27,082
<i>Any chance you're gonna cure
the common cold for us?</i>

98
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:29,932
<i>Your flu shots will have to suffice.</i>

99
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:32,725
<i>I'm afraid even we haven't cracked
the common cold.</i>

100
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,477
<i>I guess even the V's
have their limitations.</i>

101
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:37,940
<i>Anna, thank you so much</i>
<i>for being with us.</i>

102
00:06:38,693 --> 00:06:39,565
Mom...

103
00:06:40,212 --> 00:06:42,216
It's been, like,
way more than two minutes.

104
00:06:43,673 --> 00:06:44,519
Sorry.

105
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:49,626
I'm all yours.

106
00:06:52,576 --> 00:06:55,900
It's about
the girl you met last night...

107
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,286
Half-naked girl
in my son's room Lisa.

108
00:06:59,684 --> 00:07:01,713
Sorry... I'm sorry. Do you...

109
00:07:04,837 --> 00:07:07,217
I'm not gonna get it. I wanna hear.

110
00:07:09,456 --> 00:07:11,359
It's work. You should take it.
It's fine.

111
00:07:11,484 --> 00:07:14,011
Will you hold on for a second?
'Cause i will get rid of 'em.

112
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,935
It's Ryan.

113
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,783
I'm gonna need to call you back.

114
00:07:18,908 --> 00:07:20,401
<i>What? No, this can't wait.</i>

115
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,385
No, mom, seriously, it's fine.

116
00:07:24,476 --> 00:07:26,945
- We'll talk about it later.
- We can...

117
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:33,994
We need to meet... Right now.

118
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,359
This thing that Anna's calling
a vitamin injection...

119
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,688
- She's lying.
- How do you know?

120
00:07:40,049 --> 00:07:43,138
A couple years ago,
I took out a cell of V scientists.

121
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,240
They were working on an injection.

122
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,661
They tried to mass produce
and distribute it among humans.

123
00:07:48,786 --> 00:07:52,346
If you're gonna put something harmful
into a vitamin, why do you go on TV,

124
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,098
make such a big deal about it?

125
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,830
Anna wouldn't make an announcement
like this if it wasn't big.

126
00:07:56,955 --> 00:07:59,849
I know what I'm talking about.
They've reactivated this plan.

127
00:08:00,421 --> 00:08:03,440
So they're gonna what...
Take us out one shot at a time?

128
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,299
No, this is part of something
that's just much bigger.

129
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:09,972
I know the names of the V's that
were involved the last time.

130
00:08:10,097 --> 00:08:12,035
Some of them survived. Maybe

131
00:08:13,153 --> 00:08:16,561
you can run 'em through the FBI,
see who's stilling out there.

132
00:08:25,485 --> 00:08:27,131
This isn't getting us anywhere.

133
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:28,959
Is that all of them?

134
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,179
Try Peter Combs.

135
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:37,445
He was a lab assistant,
pretty low level.

136
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:45,816
That's him.

137
00:08:47,297 --> 00:08:50,163
Professor of chemistry?
Not low level anymore.

138
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:52,374
- This Peter Combs' a V?
- He's a V.

139
00:08:52,752 --> 00:08:54,856
We track him down
and find out what he's up to.

140
00:08:54,981 --> 00:08:56,285
Let's just take him out?

141
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,495
Taking out one V
is not gonna get us anywhere.

142
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,266
If we follow him, he'll lead us
to a bigger part of the puzzle.

143
00:09:01,391 --> 00:09:03,519
Seriously, that's the plan?

144
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:05,252
Follow him?

145
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:08,255
That's the plan.

146
00:09:10,207 --> 00:09:12,527
I can't talk to my mom anymore.

147
00:09:12,909 --> 00:09:15,631
I've tried telling her
about this girl i met...

148
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:17,913
She won't give me two seconds.

149
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,556
She doesn't trust me.
She just keeps on telling me,

150
00:09:21,681 --> 00:09:23,747
"Stay away from the V's."

151
00:09:24,233 --> 00:09:27,295
And you don't know how to tell her
that the V's are important to you?

152
00:09:28,578 --> 00:09:30,084
She doesn't want to hear it.

153
00:09:33,993 --> 00:09:36,450
I joined the peace ambassadors.

154
00:09:37,627 --> 00:09:40,379
If my mom knew,
she would go ballistic.

155
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,292
She thinks the V's are evil.

156
00:09:46,593 --> 00:09:48,253
And how do you see them?

157
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:51,633
The world's broken.

158
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,091
They're fixing it.

159
00:09:53,524 --> 00:09:55,802
All we do is, we get in their way.

160
00:09:57,591 --> 00:09:59,508
They got these healing centers.

161
00:10:00,106 --> 00:10:01,725
The things they can do...

162
00:10:02,007 --> 00:10:04,269
Have you been down there
to the healing centers?

163
00:10:04,994 --> 00:10:06,488
No. Not yet.

164
00:10:07,225 --> 00:10:08,273
Why?

165
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:09,451
I just...

166
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:11,887
I've been tempted myself
to check them out.

167
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:13,904
I hear you have to wait months
though.

168
00:10:15,012 --> 00:10:18,143
If you really wanna go,
I might be able to help.

169
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,577
I kinda know someone.

170
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,131
That's really sweet of you, Tyler.

171
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,582
I might actually
take you up on that.

172
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:30,071
I hear they're curing blindness,

173
00:10:30,992 --> 00:10:33,556
helping handicapped people walk,

174
00:10:33,681 --> 00:10:35,592
all these great things, and...

175
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:39,794
My mom will never know because
she won't even talk to one.

176
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:43,892
<i>You know, I shouldn't even care.</i>

177
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,932
<i>I'm gonna be 18 in a month, and then
I won't have to deal with any of this.</i>

178
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,904
<i>Your mom doesn't stop being a mom
because you're 18.</i>

179
00:10:53,245 --> 00:10:56,347
<I>I feel like she stopped
being by mom a long time ago.</I>

180
00:10:56,635 --> 00:10:58,282
I thought it might take longer,

181
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:02,060
but I think Tyler's ready.

182
00:11:02,331 --> 00:11:03,133
Good.

183
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,197
Bring him up to the ship.

184
00:11:05,322 --> 00:11:07,034
Tell him I wanna meet him.

Season 1 Episode 4
[It's Only The Beginning]

189
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,869
Thank you again for doing this
report on our healing centers.

190
00:11:29,112 --> 00:11:31,515
It's not like I had
much of a choice.

191
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,749
Anna wouldn't do the interview
with me unless I did this.

192
00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:07,757
That's amazing.

193
00:12:08,087 --> 00:12:11,175
And that's why we want you
to share our story with the world.

194
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,608
<I>This is Tyler. You know what to do.</I>

195
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:29,439
- Still can't get a hold of him?
- He's mad at me.

196
00:12:30,202 --> 00:12:31,784
You wanna talk about it?

197
00:12:32,087 --> 00:12:33,133
I do not.

198
00:12:36,263 --> 00:12:37,098
Hello?

199
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,584
<i>It's Ryan. We're set.</i>

200
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:41,603
Class is out in 15 minutes.

201
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,615
When Combs heads to his car,
we got him covered.

202
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,743
I'm on the ground floor,
Georgie's upstairs.

203
00:12:46,868 --> 00:12:48,967
<i>I'm checking in with Georgie now.</i>

204
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:10,013
You've interviewed
all of the medical staff?

205
00:13:10,138 --> 00:13:14,142
Extensively. We couldn't find anyone
who could shed any light on the murder.

206
00:13:14,342 --> 00:13:17,072
How many of your staff
were on duty that day?

207
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:18,602
14, maybe 15.

208
00:13:19,437 --> 00:13:20,640
Gather them.

209
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:24,361
- They've already been questioned.
- I understand that.

210
00:13:25,231 --> 00:13:26,731
Gather them anyway.

211
00:13:36,395 --> 00:13:38,520
- You have to get off the ship.
- I'm not running.

212
00:13:38,645 --> 00:13:41,470
- The Column needs you.
- You'll carry on, so will the others.

213
00:13:41,595 --> 00:13:43,751
You cannot be sacrificed
no matter what.

214
00:13:45,052 --> 00:13:46,283
I won't let it happen.

215
00:14:25,977 --> 00:14:26,781
Combs.

216
00:14:29,523 --> 00:14:31,103
I'm gonna cut you open.

217
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,533
And show the world what you are.

218
00:14:37,456 --> 00:14:38,663
Get the car.

219
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:18,187
You need to put pressure
on that wound.

220
00:15:19,997 --> 00:15:21,471
What the hell happened?

221
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:25,497
He just started shooting at me.

222
00:15:25,931 --> 00:15:28,544
We need to get him some help.
I'm gonna take care of Combs.

223
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,845
- What happened?
- I don't know yet.

224
00:15:36,321 --> 00:15:37,917
- You got him?
- I got him.

225
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,298
- I'll take care of him. Just be safe.
- You, too.

226
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,410
You thought you were
gonna get away this time.

227
00:15:48,609 --> 00:15:51,258
You can't stop us, filthy traitor!

228
00:16:25,004 --> 00:16:26,276
You're a Visitor.

230
00:16:34,817 --> 00:16:36,494
What the hell is going on?

231
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:39,289
You and I want the same thing.

232
00:16:39,849 --> 00:16:41,814
We both want to know
what Combs was doing.

233
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:45,253
- Now i got nothing. You just shot him.
- He was gonna kill you.

234
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,177
We're on the same side, Erica.

235
00:16:49,557 --> 00:16:51,620
Everything
that I've told you is true.

236
00:16:52,103 --> 00:16:54,179
Except that you're a Visitor.

237
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,222
Never said I wasn't.

238
00:16:58,829 --> 00:17:00,560
Sirens are getting close.

239
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:02,584
What's it gonna be?

240
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,124
Hi. A friend of mine called
and made an appointment for me.

241
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,858
The diagnostic scan
provides an image

242
00:17:19,983 --> 00:17:23,004
of every system in your body
on a cellular scale.

243
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:27,676
A level of detail our medical technology
can't even begin to fathom.

244
00:17:28,432 --> 00:17:29,599
I'm all set.

245
00:17:32,722 --> 00:17:35,369
For anyone who's had
an M.R.I. or a C.A.T. scan,

246
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:37,221
This scan is...

247
00:17:38,217 --> 00:17:40,934
Well, i gotta say,
it's kinda pleasant.

248
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,375
Okay, cut.

249
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,896
Check that back for me,
will you, Gary? Thank you.

250
00:17:46,462 --> 00:17:48,149
Getting everything you need,
Mr. Decker?

251
00:17:52,376 --> 00:17:54,858
Could use a little more freedom
to walk around,

252
00:17:54,983 --> 00:17:58,159
talk to some of the patients...
Alone.

253
00:17:58,521 --> 00:17:59,624
I understand.

254
00:18:00,141 --> 00:18:01,819
Tight schedule, I'm afraid.

255
00:18:02,101 --> 00:18:03,361
Maybe next time.

256
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,719
How does a priest know
the way around a bullet wound?

257
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:19,055
Army chaplain. Two tours in Iraq.

258
00:18:20,631 --> 00:18:23,405
You and the blonde
are full of surprises.

259
00:18:24,914 --> 00:18:26,855
You went after that V
in the garage, didn't you?

260
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:29,983
I did what was right
if we want to win this thing.

261
00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:32,485
You got lucky.
The bullet went through.

262
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,738
Yeah, I feel lucky.

263
00:18:35,097 --> 00:18:36,030
All right...

264
00:18:36,953 --> 00:18:38,216
This is gonna hurt.

265
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:43,204
Pretty soon, you're gonna need
to decide what you are...

266
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:47,250
A priest or a soldier.

267
00:19:01,202 --> 00:19:04,062
We're not gonna get anywhere until
you get your question out, so...

268
00:19:04,187 --> 00:19:04,934
Go.

269
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:07,812
- What happened to Combs?
- Suicide pill.

270
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,740
Leaves no real evidence behind,
nothing but ash.

271
00:19:11,305 --> 00:19:13,026
All V's carry one. Next.

272
00:19:14,241 --> 00:19:15,917
He called you a traitor.

273
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,865
Are there other V's like you,
fighting against Anna?

274
00:19:26,052 --> 00:19:27,791
They're called the 5th Column.

275
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,362
Good to know.

276
00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:34,185
Good.

277
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,505
This just looks like paperwork.

278
00:19:43,865 --> 00:19:47,042
He would get all of his supplies
from his department, right?

279
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:48,102
Probably.

280
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,338
So what's his connection to
the Lyndhurst shipping company?

281
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,366
Let's go check it out.

282
00:19:58,784 --> 00:20:01,754
The murdered sleeper agent
was a valuable asset.

283
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:06,413
Had he been debriefed, he would have
provided us with invaluable information.

284
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,023
Someone prevented that
from happening.

285
00:20:13,548 --> 00:20:15,404
Would you please join the rest?

286
00:20:18,358 --> 00:20:20,468
You are a part of
the medical staff, aren't you?

287
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:44,951
Unless the guilty party steps
forward to take responsibility,

288
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:47,671
I'm gonna need to choose one of you

289
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:49,778
to set an example.

290
00:20:53,742 --> 00:20:55,703
The innocent will suffer.

291
00:21:01,392 --> 00:21:02,692
Last chance.

292
00:21:16,417 --> 00:21:18,276
Long live the 5th Column.

293
00:21:24,085 --> 00:21:27,688
As lead medical officer,
you will carry out the sentence.

294
00:21:31,635 --> 00:21:32,694
Skin him.

296
00:21:52,286 --> 00:21:54,056
Am i in trouble with your mom?

297
00:21:54,553 --> 00:21:55,995
Why would you be in trouble?

298
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,370
I don't know.

299
00:21:57,496 --> 00:21:59,775
When you called and said
she wanted to meet me,

300
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:01,568
If it was my mom, I'd be in trouble.

301
00:22:02,816 --> 00:22:04,225
Mine's not like that.

302
00:22:04,457 --> 00:22:06,913
You guys are so much more
evolved than we are.

303
00:22:07,595 --> 00:22:09,503
Oh, my God. That's Anna.

304
00:22:12,847 --> 00:22:15,483
- Do you know her or...
- Yeah. That's my mom.

305
00:22:18,034 --> 00:22:19,045
Come on.

306
00:22:28,512 --> 00:22:30,161
Lisa's told me all about you.

307
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:33,410
She, didn't tell me,
a lot about you.

308
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:38,465
But i already know
a lot about you, so...

309
00:22:41,753 --> 00:22:44,293
I'd like to take some time
to get to know Tyler.

310
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,644
Is that all right with you?

311
00:22:50,113 --> 00:22:50,994
Sure.

312
00:22:51,749 --> 00:22:52,661
Don't worry.

313
00:22:53,215 --> 00:22:54,455
She doesn't bite.

314
00:22:59,464 --> 00:23:00,377
See you later.

315
00:23:08,884 --> 00:23:09,762
Excuse me.

316
00:23:10,535 --> 00:23:12,016
Can i talk to you for a second?

317
00:23:12,654 --> 00:23:13,677
Thank you.

318
00:23:16,861 --> 00:23:18,095
I'm so lost.

319
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:20,688
I was looking for 5700 Gibbs, and...

320
00:23:20,998 --> 00:23:23,093
You know,
that address is right over!

321
00:23:28,937 --> 00:23:30,646
- How's Georgie?
- He'll be fine.

322
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:35,855
- What are you doing?
- Protocol 9.

323
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,286
Tells everybody in the building
to evacuate immediately.

324
00:23:38,411 --> 00:23:40,667
They'll meet at a rally point
off site until further notice.

325
00:23:41,624 --> 00:23:43,905
Should buy us some time
while we're in there.

326
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,281
There you go.

327
00:23:49,355 --> 00:23:50,679
All right. Let's move.

328
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,076
Lisa's happiness has always been
the highest priority for me.

329
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:58,858
Right now you seem
to be a big part of her life.

330
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:01,172
She's quite taken with you.

331
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,176
Me too. I mean, you know, with her.

332
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:07,470
Good. I'm glad.
I wanted to make sure you felt the same.

333
00:24:07,761 --> 00:24:11,286
It's universal instinct for mothers
to be protective of their young.

334
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,338
Lisa mentioned you
liked motorcycles.

335
00:24:14,706 --> 00:24:16,670
Yeah, I'm kind of hooked
on machines.

336
00:24:16,795 --> 00:24:17,795
Well...

337
00:24:18,464 --> 00:24:20,130
I think you'll enjoy this.

338
00:24:40,802 --> 00:24:44,075
This is the propulsion system
we use on each of our 29 ships.

339
00:24:45,013 --> 00:24:45,844
This...

340
00:24:46,607 --> 00:24:47,651
is the engine room.

341
00:24:48,826 --> 00:24:50,438
You've gotta be kidding me.

342
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,115
No human has ever seen this before.

343
00:24:54,183 --> 00:24:55,949
You are the first, Tyler.

344
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:01,768
I thought you'd like it.

345
00:25:19,255 --> 00:25:20,777
How could you do this?

346
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:25,317
How could you sacrifice yourself?
You had to be protected.

347
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:29,527
You're one of Anna's closest advisors,
the best hope for the column.

348
00:25:32,618 --> 00:25:35,556
- I can't move my body.
- I gave you something.

349
00:25:42,784 --> 00:25:45,114
- I can't do this.
- She suspects you.

350
00:25:45,665 --> 00:25:47,586
That's why she's making you do it.
You have to.

351
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,010
Joshua, do it.

352
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:53,884
My death will be meaningless
if you're found out.

353
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:45,558
Come on.

354
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,704
You gotta see this.

355
00:27:13,692 --> 00:27:15,485
- R6?
- What the hell is R6?

356
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:17,564
What they're putting in
their vitamin shot.

357
00:27:17,689 --> 00:27:19,325
They're experimenting on people.

358
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:27,530
Is that the vitamin shot?

359
00:27:28,622 --> 00:27:31,132
- It's the flu vaccine.
- What, human vaccine?

360
00:27:32,078 --> 00:27:34,162
They're not mixing their drug
into the vitamin shot.

361
00:27:34,287 --> 00:27:36,444
They're mixing it
into our flu vaccine.

362
00:27:39,154 --> 00:27:40,695
Shipment leaves tomorrow.

364
00:27:47,557 --> 00:27:50,785
They did everything from here...
Tested it on humans,

365
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:53,317
Packaged it
to look like the flu shot.

366
00:27:53,649 --> 00:27:55,923
When this shipment mingles
with the real shots,

367
00:27:56,048 --> 00:27:57,547
No one could tell the difference.

368
00:27:57,672 --> 00:28:00,312
And no government agency's gonna
be worrying about a flu vaccine

369
00:28:00,448 --> 00:28:02,258
When they've got a V
vitamin to evaluate.

370
00:28:02,383 --> 00:28:05,323
Which, in all likelihood,
is nothing more than a vitamin shot.

371
00:28:05,929 --> 00:28:08,733
They know exactly how to play us.

372
00:28:09,484 --> 00:28:13,009
The media bombards us with stories
of epidemics, pandemics,

373
00:28:13,141 --> 00:28:15,883
so we run out.
We get a shot to protect ourselves.

374
00:28:16,217 --> 00:28:19,544
That's what the V's are counting on.
Our predictability,

375
00:28:20,057 --> 00:28:21,513
Our human nature.

376
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,505
It's very calculated, isn't it?

377
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:26,530
Everything that Anna
does is calculated.

378
00:28:26,766 --> 00:28:29,336
So what, we stop doing
what makes us human?

379
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:31,990
All I'm saying is the more
predictable we are,

380
00:28:32,755 --> 00:28:34,283
the more vulnerable we are.

381
00:28:36,275 --> 00:28:38,014
I'm gonna keep this as evidence.

382
00:28:38,139 --> 00:28:39,800
The rest we destroy.

383
00:28:45,908 --> 00:28:48,491
The diagnostic scan
detected your heart condition.

384
00:28:48,616 --> 00:28:50,470
And it is a condition we can heal.

385
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:53,734
Oh, my God. That's wonderful.
I was just looking for a change in meds.

386
00:28:53,975 --> 00:28:55,532
But the thing is, Ms. Stevens,

387
00:28:55,657 --> 00:28:57,942
the diagnostic also
turned up something else.

388
00:28:58,801 --> 00:29:00,101
Something else?

389
00:29:17,103 --> 00:29:19,520
- They came back.
- They figured it out. 

390
00:29:19,645 --> 00:29:21,517
- Go. I'll be there.
- Where are you going?

391
00:29:21,642 --> 00:29:23,785
Every V security
system has a fail-safe.

392
00:30:24,851 --> 00:30:26,909
Hurry. Come on!
They're coming! Let's go!

394
00:31:00,281 --> 00:31:01,498
Mr. Decker.

395
00:31:02,202 --> 00:31:03,040
Yes?

396
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:06,866
May we have a word before you go?

397
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:14,068
I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure
i heard you right.

398
00:31:14,807 --> 00:31:16,285
You think I'm gonna die?

399
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,688
Had you not come here,
almost certainly.

400
00:31:19,368 --> 00:31:21,045
In approximately six months,

401
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,597
you will develop
a basilar artery aneurysm.

402
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:27,395
But we can heal you,
prevent it from developing.

403
00:31:31,564 --> 00:31:35,406
You wouldn't be offended
if i got a second opinion, would you?

404
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:39,220
Your technology won't be able
to detect this until it's too late.

405
00:31:39,345 --> 00:31:42,531
I know this kind of news
is difficult, Mr. Decker.

406
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,194
But the science
is incredibly accurate.

407
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:48,643
Would you like a printout
of your medical history?

408
00:31:48,768 --> 00:31:50,237
I didn't give it you.

409
00:31:50,362 --> 00:31:52,927
We analyze in four dimensions...
the fourth being time.

410
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,766
Medically we can determine
what's going to happen

411
00:31:55,891 --> 00:31:57,498
or what's already happened.

412
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,742
Any trauma your body sustained
over the years,

413
00:31:59,867 --> 00:32:02,570
there's a biological marker
of it stored in every cell.

414
00:32:02,695 --> 00:32:04,171
We just extrapolate the data.

415
00:32:05,142 --> 00:32:07,967
Chicken pox at age 8,
bronchitis at 14,

416
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:10,678
a broken femur, 26.

417
00:32:11,351 --> 00:32:13,138
Appendicitis at 31

418
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,296
and migraines your whole life.

419
00:32:15,421 --> 00:32:17,968
As i said, Chad,
incredibly accurate.

420
00:32:18,948 --> 00:32:21,772
But the good news is,
we can heal you.

421
00:32:22,614 --> 00:32:24,235
The bad news is

422
00:32:24,479 --> 00:32:26,127
there is a long waiting list.

423
00:32:26,795 --> 00:32:29,163
Though i suppose
if you're open to it,

424
00:32:30,297 --> 00:32:31,756
we could work something out.

425
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:39,402
It may not be anything more than
a hiccup to Anna, but tonight

426
00:32:39,527 --> 00:32:40,740
we landed a punch.

427
00:32:40,865 --> 00:32:41,861
Yeah, we did.

428
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:45,711
Speaking of punches, Father,
you got a hell of a right hook.

429
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,781
That V didn't see it coming.

430
00:32:49,149 --> 00:32:52,119
- You guys gonna be okay getting home?
- We'll manage.

431
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,913
We made a difference tonight.

432
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:05,983
Our plan is beginning to take hold.

433
00:33:06,971 --> 00:33:09,525
Lisa was right. Tyler is the one.

434
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:12,406
What is it?

435
00:33:12,888 --> 00:33:15,993
The warehouse containing
all of the R6 compound has been lost.

436
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:17,551
How?

437
00:33:17,935 --> 00:33:20,757
In an explosion.
It's all been destroyed.

438
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,350
It was sabotage.

439
00:33:23,475 --> 00:33:26,003
We received a message from
the warehouse moments before.

440
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,925
Word has spread quickly.
Every ship has heard.

441
00:33:32,774 --> 00:33:36,094
There was already a growing concern,
but now there is real fear.

442
00:33:37,533 --> 00:33:39,834
Then we'll have to manage
their fear.

443
00:33:40,956 --> 00:33:44,379
Remind everyone that even
a mid talk of the 5th Column...

444
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:47,478
of John May...

445
00:33:49,391 --> 00:33:50,768
They have me.

446
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:43,364
<i>No need for regrets for mistakes
made yesterday.</i>

447
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:46,340
<i>The past is gone.</i>

448
00:34:48,843 --> 00:34:50,369
<i>No looming fate,</i>

449
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:53,148
<i>no uncontrollable destiny.</i>

450
00:34:54,263 --> 00:34:56,374
<i>No hunger. No sickness.</i>

451
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:58,295
<i>No fear.</i>

452
00:34:59,844 --> 00:35:00,806
<i>No death.</i>

453
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,524
<i>Nothing ahead.</i>

454
00:35:11,066 --> 00:35:12,560
<i>Nothing behind.</i>

455
00:35:13,173 --> 00:35:14,636
<i>Just stillness...</i>

456
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:18,907
<i>light...</i>

457
00:35:19,804 --> 00:35:20,681
<i>warmth.</i>

458
00:35:22,648 --> 00:35:24,205
<i>The pain you felt,</i>

459
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:27,223
<i>the pain that you may have
caused others...</i>

460
00:35:27,642 --> 00:35:28,917
<i>it's behind you.</i>

461
00:35:30,266 --> 00:35:31,946
<i>No looking back.</i>

462
00:35:32,551 --> 00:35:34,954
<i>No fear of what will come.</i>

463
00:35:36,417 --> 00:35:38,251
<i>Just the pulse of time,</i>

464
00:35:40,164 --> 00:35:41,247
<i>invigorating,</i>

465
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:42,756
<i>soothing.</i>

466
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,292
<i>Bask in my light.</i>

467
00:35:46,046 --> 00:35:48,937
<i>Take comfort knowing i am here.</i>

468
00:35:49,738 --> 00:35:51,975
<i>You will never be alone.</i>

469
00:35:54,505 --> 00:35:55,611
What was that?

470
00:35:58,497 --> 00:36:00,331
A gift from my mother.

471
00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:05,613
We call it bliss.

472
00:36:26,425 --> 00:36:27,735
Sweetheart, I'm home.

473
00:36:28,378 --> 00:36:29,694
I'm in here.

474
00:36:33,437 --> 00:36:34,733
You all right?

475
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,834
- How you feeling?
- Okay.

476
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:43,492
I got some news today.

477
00:36:44,527 --> 00:36:45,452
What's wrong?

478
00:36:46,358 --> 00:36:49,290
I didn't believe it,
so i had to confirm it.

479
00:36:51,101 --> 00:36:53,043
I wasn't tired 'cause of my meds.

480
00:36:57,973 --> 00:36:59,757
I'm pregnant.

481
00:37:01,627 --> 00:37:03,437
We're gonna have a baby!

482
00:37:35,269 --> 00:37:39,273
<i>Pretty soon you need
to decide what you are...</i>

483
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:43,476
<i>A priest or a soldier.</i>

484
00:37:54,418 --> 00:37:55,798
Father Travis?

485
00:38:01,962 --> 00:38:03,196
Father Travis?

486
00:38:11,638 --> 00:38:13,882
Who are you? How'd you get in here?

487
00:38:14,007 --> 00:38:15,717
The door was open.

488
00:38:16,112 --> 00:38:17,519
I need to talk.

489
00:38:18,744 --> 00:38:20,230
I'm sorry. It's late.

490
00:38:20,475 --> 00:38:22,159
You're gonna have to leave.

491
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,135
I'm desperate.

492
00:38:26,364 --> 00:38:27,637
I'm here tomorrow.

493
00:38:27,969 --> 00:38:29,297
We can talk tomorrow.

494
00:38:32,807 --> 00:38:34,736
What is it that you need? Are you...

495
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,918
Tyler?

496
00:39:14,027 --> 00:39:16,228
"Can't believe you were invited
up to the v ship!"

497
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:29,884
Is everything okay, Tyler?

498
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:31,899
Everything's fine.

499
00:39:33,782 --> 00:39:35,197
Beautiful, isn't it?

500
00:39:36,094 --> 00:39:38,834
It must be awesome seeing space
from one of these ships.

501
00:39:39,303 --> 00:39:40,919
Maybe one day you will.

502
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,710
What you've seen today, Tyler...

503
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:57,160
Is only the beginning.
