1
00:00:00,406 --> 00:00:01,498
<i>Previously on</i> V...

2
00:00:01,623 --> 00:00:04,536
Your father's been lying to you.
I don't think he's really your dad.

3
00:00:04,736 --> 00:00:07,056
They disguise their appearance
by cloning human flesh.

4
00:00:07,181 --> 00:00:09,042
I want you to confirm
you see skull bone.

5
00:00:09,167 --> 00:00:12,475
John May started the 5th Column.
He was the first V to turn against Anna.

6
00:00:12,627 --> 00:00:15,014
This message will give them
the confidence to come out.

7
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:18,395
I need to talk to you.
I'm not who you think I am.

8
00:00:18,622 --> 00:00:21,174
- What do you want?
- I don't want to be ordinary.

9
00:00:21,299 --> 00:00:22,897
If you were, you wouldn't be here.

10
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:25,775
George Sutton died.
We did not get any names.

11
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,543
My army is to be born.

12
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,842
How did you get in?

13
00:00:52,467 --> 00:00:54,506
Before I arrived on this planet,

14
00:00:54,798 --> 00:00:55,972
you read the news.

15
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,183
Now you are the news.

16
00:01:00,683 --> 00:01:02,770
You can have everything, Chad.

17
00:01:03,344 --> 00:01:04,539
But first...

18
00:01:05,393 --> 00:01:06,743
I need to know...

19
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:11,888
can I trust you?

20
00:01:42,454 --> 00:01:43,477
Let go.

21
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:00,871
<i>Once again, we look to the future
as delegates from around the world</i>

22
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:03,986
<i>convene in Geneva today
for the annual world progress forum.</i>

23
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:06,321
<i>This high-level meeting
of the minds brings together</i>

24
00:02:06,446 --> 00:02:08,773
<i>some of the world's
most powerful men and women</i>

25
00:02:08,898 --> 00:02:11,383
<i>to explore solutions

26
00:02:11,508 --> 00:02:13,249
<i>outside of the political realm.</i>

27
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:16,382
<i>But all eyes are
on visitor high commander Anna,</i>

28
00:02:16,507 --> 00:02:19,947
<i>who has unexpectedly shown up,
amidst opposition, </i>

29
00:02:20,072 --> 00:02:23,205
<i>hoping to present their advanced

30
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,351

00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:31,908
<i>United Nations senior officials</i>

34
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:34,361
<i>and an array of emerging leaders...</i>

35
00:02:42,283 --> 00:02:43,966
Ty, I got you bagels.

36
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,664
Zabar's.

37
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,157
You're up early.

38
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:48,952
I never went to sleep.

39
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:52,692
I know you're angry,
but I need to talk to you.

40
00:02:52,817 --> 00:02:54,882
What your father told you
isn't true.

41
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,505
I always thought it was my fault
that you two broke up,

42
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,261
because of my stupid bike accident.

43
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:03,140
I didn't know that you felt that way.
If I had, I would have told you.

44
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,642
Yeah, but you didn't.

45
00:03:04,992 --> 00:03:07,109
Ty, there was never anyone else.

46
00:03:07,234 --> 00:03:08,618
Joe is your father.

47
00:03:08,743 --> 00:03:10,951
We are a family.

48
00:03:12,006 --> 00:03:13,818
What else haven't you told me, mom?

49
00:03:20,093 --> 00:03:21,093
Nothing.

50
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,736
There's nothing else.

51
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:27,001
- Where are you going?
- To the ship,

52
00:03:27,126 --> 00:03:29,041
where people are honest with me.

53
00:03:39,488 --> 00:03:40,678
<i>I saw the passports,</i>

54
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,174
the fake names.

55
00:03:42,858 --> 00:03:44,390
I don't know who you are.

56
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:47,059
Last night I was coming home
to tell you the truth,

57
00:03:47,678 --> 00:03:49,028
<i>about everything.</i>

58
00:03:49,153 --> 00:03:51,021
Whose baby is this, Ryan?

59
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,983
- Val, that is our baby.
- <i>I saw the ultrasounds.</i>

60
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,193
I'm only six weeks.
This can't be my baby.

61
00:03:56,626 --> 00:03:57,645
It's too big.</i>

62
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,447
Just tell me where you are.
I'm coming to get you.

63
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,758
<i>What I have to tell
has to be told face-to-face.</i>

64
00:04:02,883 --> 00:04:04,368
You had your chance.

65
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:11,125
<i>Leave a message.</i>

66
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,754
- Come on in.
- Anything?

67
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:21,594
No.

68
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:25,181
She just called. She hung up
before I could explain to her.

69
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,455
She's scared.

70
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,811
If she goes to a regular OB
or even to a hospital...

71
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,020
Any human doctor will see
the baby's different.

72
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:34,023
I've called everybody. Her mother,
her friends. No one's seen her.

73
00:04:34,568 --> 00:04:36,202
Then we'd better find her,

74
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:38,193
before it's too late.

75
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,302
- What do we have?
- Three victims.

76
00:04:45,427 --> 00:04:46,527
Carl Bryant,

77
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:49,051
Tom Maslon,

78
00:04:50,928 --> 00:04:52,028
Juan Solano.

79
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,668
Solano and Bryant
don't have any priors,

80
00:04:54,793 --> 00:04:56,947
but Maslon was
on our terrorist "watch" list

81
00:04:57,072 --> 00:04:59,006
a few years ago for an arms dealing.

82
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,985
Slashed carotids and windpipes,
so no one would hear.

83
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,364
Picked 'em off one by one,
really fast.

84
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,524
The killer knew what he was doing.

85
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:08,316
There's a fourth guy.

86
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,730
Witness outside saw
somebody stumble out.

87
00:05:10,855 --> 00:05:13,520
Said he looked terrified,
so he's probably not our killer.

88
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,450
All three of the vics
share this mark.

89
00:05:22,332 --> 00:05:23,614
Recognize that mark?

90
00:05:26,324 --> 00:05:27,047
No.

91
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,059
Any idea what it means?

92
00:05:32,538 --> 00:05:33,699
Check this out.

93
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,632
Apparently, they were planning
a terrorist attack against the Vs.

94
00:05:42,286 --> 00:05:44,696
My intel says they call
themselves the 5th Column.

95
00:05:46,109 --> 00:05:47,884
This must be one of their cells.

96
00:05:49,763 --> 00:05:51,013
The 5th Column?

97
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,042
Anti-visitor terrorist group
we've been tracking.

98
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:58,040
There's been increased chatter
since that rallying cry appeared

99
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,824
on the bottom of the mother ship,
two nights ago.

100
00:06:05,076 --> 00:06:07,241
I could use your
terrorism expertise.

101
00:06:07,843 --> 00:06:10,327
Kendrick wants us to investigate
the 5th Column.

102
00:06:12,014 --> 00:06:14,087
Prints came back on our missing guy,

103
00:06:15,173 --> 00:06:16,257
Alex Caruso,

104
00:06:16,615 --> 00:06:18,669
High School
computer science teacher.

105
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,337
Apparently, he's an amateur.

106
00:06:20,693 --> 00:06:22,506
Looks like you got your first lead.

107
00:06:24,293 --> 00:06:25,384
Find Caruso.

108
00:06:25,721 --> 00:06:28,414
Before the killer does.
Get us to the 5th Column.

109
00:06:29,466 --> 00:06:31,748
You were right about
the "John May lives" message.

110
00:06:31,873 --> 00:06:34,827
They are coming out of hiding,
as you expected they would.

111
00:06:35,242 --> 00:06:37,764
They're being met with swift
and exacting punishment.

112
00:06:39,508 --> 00:06:40,232
Good.

113
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:50,284
I hope you slept well.
We have a big day ahead of us.

114
00:06:50,582 --> 00:06:53,245
I'm looking forward to it.
I've never covered this event before.

115
00:06:53,928 --> 00:06:55,598
Now you have a front row seat.

116
00:06:56,105 --> 00:06:58,167
You'll see progress
being made firsthand.

117
00:06:59,226 --> 00:07:00,478
From what I've heard,

118
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:03,464
this forum tends to be more about
political posturing than progress.

119
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:06,159
Perhaps.
But I plan to change that.

120
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,517
Erica.

121
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,770
Ryan.
Something's happened.

122
00:07:20,049 --> 00:07:21,023
What is it?

123
00:07:21,953 --> 00:07:23,567
My girlfriend is missing.

124
00:07:25,246 --> 00:07:26,346
She's human,

125
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,738
and she's pregnant.

126
00:07:28,485 --> 00:07:30,157
How is that even possible?

127
00:07:30,615 --> 00:07:32,076
It wasn't supposed to be.

128
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,163
She doesn't know the truth
about who I really am

129
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:36,915
or the Vs.

130
00:07:38,388 --> 00:07:39,670
I just thought, by...

131
00:07:39,795 --> 00:07:42,044
- lying to her, I could keep her safe...
- It's cost you.

132
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,353
I know. Every time I try
to protect Tyler,

133
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:47,758
it just pushes him closer
and closer to the visitors.

134
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,156
We won't lose them.

135
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:55,683
We can't.

136
00:08:01,218 --> 00:08:03,524
Your girl's got a baby lizard
in her terrarium?

137
00:08:08,443 --> 00:08:09,488
Not today.

138
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:11,990
Bad joke.

139
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,208
Let him go.

140
00:08:17,395 --> 00:08:18,705
Does anyone else know?

141
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,067
Georgie knew.

142
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:22,626
That's why he went up
on the ship to save me,

143
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,379
so I wouldn't lose my family to Vs,
like he did.

144
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:26,755
This morning,

145
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,798
three members of a 5th Column cell
were murdered in Queens.

146
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,418
Was this our fault?

147
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:34,596
The message we sent from the ship...
We told people to come out of hiding.

148
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,807
This is a war, padre,
and they were soldiers.

149
00:08:37,115 --> 00:08:39,979
No, they were regular people,
and, yeah, this could be our fault.

150
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:41,690
We have to stop them.

151
00:08:41,815 --> 00:08:43,981
The killers took the hard drive
out of a computer.

152
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:46,733
There could be names
of other 5th Column.

153
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,402
They'll be sitting ducks.

154
00:08:48,936 --> 00:08:50,536
This one guy got away.

155
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,153
Alex Caruso.

156
00:08:53,624 --> 00:08:55,867
He'll know who to warn?
How do we find him?

157
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,655
He didn't go home and work.


158
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,955
But his father
is at the River Heights Hospital.

159
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,604
He's dying of cancer.
I figure out, Alex checked in.

160
00:09:02,729 --> 00:09:05,025
- He won't talk to the FBI.
- If he's on his deathbed,

161
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,670
he'll open up to a priest.

162
00:09:09,762 --> 00:09:13,195
- You gonna be able to handle this?
- Take care of Val, we got it.

163
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:14,599
Go.

164
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:19,959
First the V's got Georgie.

165
00:09:20,407 --> 00:09:21,730
Now they kill these guys.

166
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:24,271
We have to stop the killing.

167
00:09:24,762 --> 00:09:26,523
We need to find Alex Caruso.

168
00:09:26,882 --> 00:09:29,470
The next blood that spills
is gonna be theirs.

169
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:34,730
Here.

170
00:09:36,671 --> 00:09:37,737
It's for you.

171
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:41,197
you don't have those on your planet.

172
00:09:47,431 --> 00:09:49,499
Before your mother left,
she asked me

173
00:09:49,624 --> 00:09:51,201
to finish the empathy tests.

174
00:09:53,998 --> 00:09:55,178
I'm down to you.

175
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,972
Whatever my mother wishes.

176
00:10:32,859 --> 00:10:33,924
You failed.

177
00:10:41,505 --> 00:10:43,058
There must be a mistake.

178
00:10:46,452 --> 00:10:48,211
It's my assignment with Tyler.

179
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:50,559
I'm supposed
to make him fall in love.

180
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:52,798
It must have distorted the results.

181
00:10:59,122 --> 00:11:01,024
You've known me my entire life.

182
00:11:03,004 --> 00:11:04,627
The test has to be wrong.

183
00:11:08,662 --> 00:11:10,812
Your mother's directive was clear:

184
00:11:11,757 --> 00:11:14,357
immolate anyone who fails.
No exceptions.

185
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:27,435
<i>- We Can't Win -</i>

186
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:32,283
Team <i>Lézards</i>

187
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:50,250
It's nice to see you,
high commander.

188
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,352
Likewise, Mr. Secretary-General.

189
00:11:52,564 --> 00:11:54,122
May I introduce Chad Decker?

190
00:11:54,976 --> 00:11:56,643
I am familiar with Mr. Decker.

191
00:11:57,837 --> 00:12:00,247
Thanks to you,
so is the entire world.

192
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,847
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Secretary-General.

193
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,698
Your presence is welcome here,

194
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,227
I hope you understand

195
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,628
the privilege of making
a presentation to this forum

196
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:13,938
is for invited guests only.

197
00:12:15,114 --> 00:12:16,906
I was hoping
you could stand by my side

198
00:12:17,031 --> 00:12:18,954
as I present blue energy technology

199
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,261
that could answer
your world's pressing concerns.

200
00:12:23,532 --> 00:12:26,745
Many here are very excited to see
the gifts you have to present.

201
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:29,576
Yet there are others
who reasonably wish

202
00:12:29,701 --> 00:12:31,436
to observe certain protocol.

203
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:33,960
You understand.

204
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,819
May I ask what camp
you're in, Mr. Chima?

205
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,619
I'm sure
the Secretary-General remains...

206
00:12:40,877 --> 00:12:41,756
objective.

207
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,420
Thank you for your understanding.

208
00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:54,905
You must have known
there would be opposition.

209
00:12:55,952 --> 00:12:57,502
I welcome opposition.

210
00:12:58,384 --> 00:13:00,336
It can only strengthen one's agenda.

211
00:13:01,258 --> 00:13:02,128
Agenda?

212
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,463
I thought this was a gift.

213
00:13:17,426 --> 00:13:19,047
Good afternoon, Mr. Caruso.

214
00:13:22,523 --> 00:13:24,158
My flesh and my heart may fail,

215
00:13:24,283 --> 00:13:26,126
but God is the strength of my heart

216
00:13:26,387 --> 00:13:28,037
and my portion forever.

217
00:13:28,885 --> 00:13:29,735
<i>Psalms.</i>

218
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,855
God provides comfort
during struggle...

219
00:13:37,229 --> 00:13:39,002
But so does family.
Is there...

220
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,194
someone I can call for you,

221
00:13:41,845 --> 00:13:43,347
that could bring you comfort?

222
00:13:53,215 --> 00:13:54,541
1st Ranger Battalion.

223
00:14:01,584 --> 00:14:02,643
Vietnam.

224
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:13,318
Two tours in Iraq, army chaplain.

225
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,395
I'm not just a priest, Victor.

226
00:14:17,642 --> 00:14:19,473
And I've learned to trust nobody.

227
00:14:21,912 --> 00:14:23,385
Come closer, father.

228
00:14:26,155 --> 00:14:27,255
Come closer.

229
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,118
My son Alex...

230
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:42,714
He told me the truth
about the visitors.

231
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,092
Some of his friends
told him about...

232
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:47,716
Fifth Column.

233
00:14:48,306 --> 00:14:49,606
He's in trouble?

234
00:14:51,174 --> 00:14:52,354
Victor, look at me.

235
00:14:53,574 --> 00:14:54,772
You can tell me.

236
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,447
Where is he, Victor?

237
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,408
Can you help him, father?

238
00:15:02,758 --> 00:15:03,903
You have my word.

239
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,323
I will do everything in my power.

240
00:15:24,255 --> 00:15:26,341
- Anybody hit?
- The guy's a lousy shot.

241
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,718
- No wonder the Vs are winning.
- Wait.

242
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,884
Alex!
Look.

243
00:15:33,514 --> 00:15:35,495
Your father told us
where to find you.

244
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,219
My name's Jack.
I'm a priest.

245
00:15:39,046 --> 00:15:40,779
We're here to help,
we're 5th Column.

246
00:15:40,904 --> 00:15:42,117
You can trust us.

247
00:15:44,273 --> 00:15:46,861
That boy's got 30 seconds
to get his wits about him.

248
00:15:47,453 --> 00:15:49,447
- No, he's just scared!
- Stop!

249
00:15:55,376 --> 00:15:56,663
Alex, Don't shoot.

250
00:15:57,411 --> 00:15:58,707
I know you're scared.

251
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:00,125
Don't be stupid.

252
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:05,560
Yesterday, you were a schoolteacher,
and I was just an FBI Agent

253
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:06,862
and...

254
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:07,981
a mom.

255
00:16:09,038 --> 00:16:11,825
Because of the visitors,
our worlds have turned upside down.

256
00:16:12,383 --> 00:16:13,577
We're here to help.

257
00:16:15,036 --> 00:16:16,433
You gotta put the gun down.

258
00:16:18,383 --> 00:16:19,277
Come out.

259
00:16:19,858 --> 00:16:20,652
Please.

260
00:16:21,202 --> 00:16:22,631
It's okay.
I promise.

261
00:16:26,964 --> 00:16:28,486
How I know you're not visitors?

262
00:16:29,046 --> 00:16:30,360
If we were visitors,

263
00:16:30,767 --> 00:16:31,907
you'd be dead.

264
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,455
Just put the gun down, Alex.

265
00:16:47,927 --> 00:16:48,947
Come on.

266
00:16:57,778 --> 00:16:59,142
Look at me.
It's okay.

267
00:17:03,876 --> 00:17:06,126
The visitors killed all my friends.

268
00:17:07,504 --> 00:17:09,152
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

269
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:12,630
I know.

270
00:17:18,401 --> 00:17:19,204
A word?

271
00:17:19,654 --> 00:17:21,749
It's never a word
with journalists, Mr. Decker.

272
00:17:21,943 --> 00:17:23,598
Two minutes, off the record.

273
00:17:24,285 --> 00:17:26,673
Off the record from the press
or from Anna?

274
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,713
I don't work for Anna.

275
00:17:29,286 --> 00:17:31,174
But would you be here without her?

276
00:17:34,374 --> 00:17:35,512
Give us a moment.

277
00:17:36,313 --> 00:17:37,286
You're right.

278
00:17:37,543 --> 00:17:39,117
I am here because of Anna.

279
00:17:39,797 --> 00:17:42,731
I've spent time covering her,
and from what I've seen,

280
00:17:42,956 --> 00:17:45,355
you're the first person
who's openly opposed her.

281
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:46,672
Why?

282
00:17:46,797 --> 00:17:49,271
There are consequences
for Anna's so-called gifts.

283
00:17:49,646 --> 00:17:51,033
Take the healing centers.

284
00:17:52,235 --> 00:17:54,906
The drain on health care industry
is immeasurable.

285
00:17:55,296 --> 00:17:57,158
Thousands of jobs are being lost,

286
00:17:57,283 --> 00:17:59,219
and as for any technology
she may offer.

287
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:01,621
It could put technology companies
out of business?

288
00:18:02,478 --> 00:18:03,623
You're saying that

289
00:18:03,976 --> 00:18:05,834
the profit is more important
than people.

290
00:18:06,861 --> 00:18:08,898
I'm saying it's the same thing.

291
00:18:17,183 --> 00:18:18,538
<i>We have reports coming in </i>

292
00:18:18,663 --> 00:18:21,061
<i>with breaking news</i> <i>out of Timbal,</i>

293
00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:24,660
<i>where a massive monsoon</i>
<i>struck this tiny island nation,</i>

294
00:18:24,785 --> 00:18:26,396
<i>two hours ago.</i>

295
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:28,425
<i>Destruction of the island's
power grid</i>

296
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,239
<i>and transportation infrastructure</i>

297
00:18:30,364 --> 00:18:32,731
<i>has hampered</i>
<i>international rescue efforts,</i>

298
00:18:32,856 --> 00:18:36,406
<i>as thousands are unaccounted for,</i>
<i>many feared dead.</i>

299
00:18:37,998 --> 00:18:38,950
Tragedy.

300
00:18:41,021 --> 00:18:42,144
An opportunity.

301
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,126
What are world leaders doing
about this crisis?

302
00:18:48,781 --> 00:18:51,023
At the moment,
they're trying to plan a response.

303
00:18:51,148 --> 00:18:53,006
It could take a day
to get help there.

304
00:18:55,779 --> 00:18:57,218
While they play politics,

305
00:18:57,568 --> 00:18:58,803
we'll take action.

306
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:02,766
Dispatch rescue shuttles to Timbal.

307
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:06,898
Bring them blue energy.

308
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,282
Tyler, what are you doing here?

309
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,300
You didn't answer my calls.

310
00:19:22,422 --> 00:19:23,828
I needed to see you.

311
00:19:25,146 --> 00:19:26,796
Now is not a good time.

312
00:19:30,613 --> 00:19:31,675
What's wrong?

313
00:19:33,642 --> 00:19:34,995
Everything's different,

314
00:19:35,367 --> 00:19:37,634
now I know
my mom and dad lied to me.

315
00:19:40,298 --> 00:19:42,649
It's like you're the only person
I can count on anymore.

316
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,176
I don't know. I just...

317
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:49,270
I really need to be away
from home right now.

318
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,220
Me, too.

319
00:20:05,713 --> 00:20:07,863
This is what I call getting away.

320
00:20:12,008 --> 00:20:13,211
Did you find Val?

321
00:20:13,518 --> 00:20:14,602
Still looking.

322
00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:16,906
I need you to put a trace
on her cell phone.

323
00:20:17,031 --> 00:20:19,558
I know I'm asking you
to break the law, but I just...

324
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,177
Can you do that?

325
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,733
It's getting to be
a habit of mine lately.

326
00:20:25,108 --> 00:20:27,225
I'll do it. I'll call you
when I have something.

327
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:28,811
Thanks.

328
00:20:33,545 --> 00:20:34,645
My friend...

329
00:20:35,545 --> 00:20:37,902
Juan told me about the 5th Column.

330
00:20:41,805 --> 00:20:43,555
We thought we could help.

331
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,369
That message on the ship
gave us hope.

332
00:20:46,918 --> 00:20:48,329
Tell us what happened.

333
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:52,778
We set up a meeting with other
5th Column to get weapons,

334
00:20:52,903 --> 00:20:55,066
but instead, a V showed up.

335
00:20:57,693 --> 00:20:59,132
And now everyone's dead.

336
00:21:01,008 --> 00:21:02,935
This meeting, how'd you set it?

337
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,389
There's a website where we dump
photos encoded with messages.

338
00:21:08,285 --> 00:21:09,726
The Vs hacked your code.

339
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,138
A hard drive
was stolen from the scene.

340
00:21:13,263 --> 00:21:16,489
Did it have names and addresses
of other 5th Column in your group?

341
00:21:17,037 --> 00:21:20,320
A list of contacts we could
reach out to if we got in trouble.

342
00:21:21,591 --> 00:21:23,076
The V has that hard drive.

343
00:21:23,388 --> 00:21:25,992
He's going to pick them off
one by one, unless we stop him.

344
00:21:26,461 --> 00:21:29,913
There's only one sure fire way
to do that before he kills anyone else.

345
00:21:30,535 --> 00:21:31,664
We bring him to us.

346
00:21:32,123 --> 00:21:32,832
How?

347
00:21:33,763 --> 00:21:35,740
- Use him as bait.
- What? No.

348
00:21:35,865 --> 00:21:38,630
Use their website
to send out an SOS.

349
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,549
The V will intercept the message
and come calling.

350
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,868
And then we kill him.

351
00:21:44,462 --> 00:21:48,139
There are 29 ships over our heads,
and we don't know why.

352
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:52,060
If we do this, we take the V alive,
finally get some answers.

353
00:21:52,486 --> 00:21:54,604
I told his father
I would keep him safe.

354
00:21:56,935 --> 00:21:58,024
It's up to you.

355
00:21:58,433 --> 00:22:00,511
You've lost friends.
So have we.

356
00:22:01,607 --> 00:22:04,851
But if we don't stop them,
more people are going to die.

357
00:22:17,684 --> 00:22:19,508
Lisa failed the test.

358
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:23,223
- Her death would be a victory for us.
- Or a great loss.

359
00:22:23,489 --> 00:22:26,094
What if she is turning,
if her feelings for Tyler are real?

360
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:29,404
If they are, she could be
a great asset for us against Anna.

361
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:32,725
And if you're wrong, we lose
the chance to destroy an enemy.

362
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,302
I've known Lisa her whole life.
She seems human.

363
00:22:35,427 --> 00:22:38,022
She's changing.
She's changing, like we did.

364
00:22:38,853 --> 00:22:40,876
How do you know
you're not being manipulated?

365
00:22:42,132 --> 00:22:45,205
What if this is a trap to test
where your loyalty lies?

366
00:22:48,424 --> 00:22:49,784
We can never trust her.

367
00:22:54,285 --> 00:22:55,435
Anna's right.

368
00:22:56,504 --> 00:22:58,126
I need to start my own life.

369
00:22:59,394 --> 00:23:00,820
What are you talking about?

370
00:23:01,992 --> 00:23:03,199
I've been thinking.

371
00:23:04,101 --> 00:23:05,675
What if I join "live aboard,"

372
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,780
and live up here?

373
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:09,638
Look,

374
00:23:10,168 --> 00:23:11,639
I know it's a big step.

375
00:23:13,828 --> 00:23:15,678
But ever since I was a kid,

376
00:23:17,205 --> 00:23:19,856
I always knew that something amazing
would happen to me.

377
00:23:21,556 --> 00:23:23,526
Like the chance
to live on a spaceship?

378
00:23:35,704 --> 00:23:37,021
I'm talking about you.

379
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:22,502
Are you okay with this?

380
00:24:37,867 --> 00:24:40,807
- Any word on the phone trace?
- Not yet. No word from Val?

381
00:24:41,265 --> 00:24:42,991
No. I've been looking everywhere.

382
00:24:43,342 --> 00:24:46,165
I figured I'd check in on you,
see if I can do something right today.

383
00:24:47,121 --> 00:24:49,651
We're using the teacher as bait
to lure out the V.

384
00:24:49,776 --> 00:24:51,114
Any idea how he'll do?

385
00:24:51,466 --> 00:24:54,700
He'll want to make his moves up close.
Knives, no guns.

386
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,911
All your tech, you don't have guns?

387
00:24:57,326 --> 00:25:00,498
You shoot our weapons through a guy,
people will start asking questions.

388
00:25:01,197 --> 00:25:03,543
Blades are simple,
untraceable and effective.

389
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,307
That's what he'll use.

390
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,671
It's how I did it.

391
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,620
What's the latest on Caruso?

392
00:25:15,745 --> 00:25:17,834
<i>NYPD reported shots fired</i>

393
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:20,059
<i>on the rooftop
of his dad's midtown apartment.</i>

394
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,853
I checked it out.
Nothing.

395
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,230
You better find him quick.
There's more.

396
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,407
So...

397
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,654
Why'd you guys join 5th Column?

398
00:25:31,825 --> 00:25:32,925
We had to...

399
00:25:33,302 --> 00:25:34,728
Erica to protect her son,

400
00:25:34,853 --> 00:25:36,868
me to protect my congregation,
my faith.

401
00:25:38,117 --> 00:25:39,203
What about you?

402
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,818
My father fought in Vietnam.

403
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:46,085
My grandpa, World War II.

404
00:25:47,197 --> 00:25:49,172
I wanted to make a difference
like they did.

405
00:25:50,276 --> 00:25:51,173
You are.

406
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:54,713
My dad warned me
I wasn't cut out for this.

407
00:25:55,663 --> 00:25:56,596
He was right.

408
00:25:57,341 --> 00:26:00,433
No, stick to the plan, Alex,
and everything's gonna be okay.

409
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:01,843
Just stick to the plan.

410
00:26:12,106 --> 00:26:12,871
What?

411
00:26:14,308 --> 00:26:16,062
There have been six more murders.

412
00:26:16,624 --> 00:26:19,590
London, Tokyo,
Los Angeles and Sidney...

413
00:26:20,104 --> 00:26:21,162
all 5th Column.

414
00:26:32,156 --> 00:26:35,978
This incredible intervention in Timbal
is being called a miracle,

415
00:26:36,103 --> 00:26:38,055
with Anna being hailed as savior.

416
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,002
Thanks to high commander Anna's
gift of blue energy,

417
00:26:41,127 --> 00:26:44,421
Timbal's power grids
and infrastructure have been restored.

418
00:26:44,546 --> 00:26:46,318
Hospitals are back up and running,

419
00:26:46,443 --> 00:26:49,753
and V shuttles continue to land
with emergency supplies.

420
00:26:49,878 --> 00:26:52,711
As a result,
leaders here at the forum

421
00:26:52,836 --> 00:26:54,497
have made a stunning reversal

422
00:26:54,622 --> 00:26:56,822
of their decision from this morning

423
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,576
- to refuse Anna's presentation.
- I made a promise when I arrived,

424
00:27:01,498 --> 00:27:03,498
to share our technology

425
00:27:04,826 --> 00:27:08,070
and to leave your planet
better than we found it.

426
00:27:31,573 --> 00:27:33,693
Clean, sustainable energy.

427
00:27:34,718 --> 00:27:35,868
No pollution.

428
00:27:36,224 --> 00:27:38,656
No infrastructure needed,
just power.

429
00:27:39,694 --> 00:27:41,944
The same power that runs our ships.

430
00:27:42,504 --> 00:27:46,234
Blue energy is the answer
to your world's most pressing concerns.

431
00:27:47,295 --> 00:27:48,962
And to the people of Timbal,

432
00:27:49,708 --> 00:27:51,252
it was an answer to crisis.

433
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:11,353
Our needs are simple,

434
00:28:11,793 --> 00:28:13,983
and our desire to help is great.

435
00:28:14,446 --> 00:28:15,526
Mr. Chima?

436
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,411
You care to comment
on what Anna's done?

437
00:28:22,095 --> 00:28:24,849
The high commander has done
an amazing and selfless thing.

438
00:28:25,629 --> 00:28:26,912
She should be commended.

439
00:28:29,263 --> 00:28:31,488
It's obvious we have
a lot to learn from you.

440
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,000
Secretary-General?

441
00:28:51,016 --> 00:28:53,303
Any further comment
on today's events?

442
00:28:53,428 --> 00:28:54,899
Off the record, of course.

443
00:28:55,632 --> 00:28:57,867
Anna came here
under the guise of diplomacy,

444
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,987
but played politics with tragedy.

445
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:04,751
She used the people of Timbal
to gain public and political clout.

446
00:29:05,421 --> 00:29:06,628
The question is,

447
00:29:07,053 --> 00:29:08,499
if they're just visitors,

448
00:29:08,936 --> 00:29:10,623
why does she need that clout?

449
00:29:26,843 --> 00:29:30,559
The V will be at the meet in one hour.
Let's go over the plan one more time.

450
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,816
<i>The codes are embedded in photos,
anything where there's five...</i>

451
00:29:33,941 --> 00:29:36,452
<i>five fingers, five dogs.
Could be anything.</i>

452
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,449
<i>It should only be us
at the meet and the V.</i>

453
00:29:39,574 --> 00:29:42,039
<i>After hours, no security, no guards.</i>

454
00:29:42,422 --> 00:29:44,079
<i>Dance floor's all ours.</i>

455
00:29:45,005 --> 00:29:47,952
You'll have my sweet voice
in your ear the whole time, kid.

456
00:29:48,379 --> 00:29:50,221
You're gonna be okay, Alex.

457
00:29:53,177 --> 00:29:55,543
Sorry, <i>padre</i>.
Ran out of Holy water.

458
00:30:01,237 --> 00:30:03,843
<i>Alex, Jack will drop you
in the center here,</i>

459
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:06,540
<i>and then he'll duck out
behind the concession stand.</i>

460
00:30:09,246 --> 00:30:11,521
<i>I'll post up half a click South.</i>

461
00:30:12,607 --> 00:30:14,478
<i>We'll be with you the whole time.</i>

462
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,480
<i>Hobbes will tell us
when the V arrives.</i>

463
00:30:21,316 --> 00:30:22,528
He'll come to you.

464
00:30:23,077 --> 00:30:25,119
Before he does, we get the drop.

465
00:30:25,927 --> 00:30:28,325
We take the visitor alive,
he comes home with us,

466
00:30:29,042 --> 00:30:30,469
and we get answers.

467
00:30:31,431 --> 00:30:32,204
We good?

468
00:30:33,913 --> 00:30:35,050
Yeah, we're good.

469
00:30:40,216 --> 00:30:41,015
Ryan.

470
00:30:44,098 --> 00:30:45,634
I got a trace on Val's cell.

471
00:30:46,043 --> 00:30:47,145
Where is she?

472
00:30:48,773 --> 00:30:50,945
Welcome
to the visitor healing center.

473
00:30:51,662 --> 00:30:54,143
A doctor will be here shortly
to look at your baby.

474
00:30:54,651 --> 00:30:56,624
Everything will be just fine.

475
00:31:10,713 --> 00:31:11,534
Lisa.

476
00:31:13,334 --> 00:31:15,610
Your mother's shuttle will be
arriving shortly.

477
00:31:15,735 --> 00:31:18,285
She's asked to see you
when she arrives.

478
00:31:20,329 --> 00:31:21,587
You have to go.

479
00:31:22,585 --> 00:31:23,379
Okay.

480
00:31:25,193 --> 00:31:26,759
I'll see you tomorrow?

481
00:31:31,719 --> 00:31:33,038
Good-bye, Tyler.

482
00:31:35,025 --> 00:31:35,767
Bye.

483
00:31:45,228 --> 00:31:47,112
Let me know when my mother arrives.

484
00:32:23,389 --> 00:32:24,733
Deep breaths, Alex.

485
00:32:25,267 --> 00:32:28,366
Listen to them, and we're all
gonna walk out of here alive.

486
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:29,670
Okay.

487
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:36,787
Holy hell.

488
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:45,379
Alex, listen to me very carefully.

489
00:32:45,814 --> 00:32:47,866
<i>Change of plans.
Ryan was wrong.</i>

490
00:32:47,991 --> 00:32:50,689
<i>The guy has got a gun.
The V's not coming to us.</i>

491
00:32:50,814 --> 00:32:52,595
<i>He's already here,
in sniper position.</i>

492
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:54,430
<i>Don't panic.
Stay where you are.</i>

493
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:56,640
Now?
He's in position now?

494
00:32:56,938 --> 00:32:59,710
<i>Alex, listen to Hobbes.
Don't move.</i>

495
00:33:00,721 --> 00:33:03,023
- Alex, freeze.
- <i>Where is he?</i>

496
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:07,860
<i>He doesn't have a clean shot.</i>
I can walk you out of there.

497
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:10,029
Do what I say.
One step to your right.

498
00:33:11,579 --> 00:33:12,652
That's it.

499
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:14,056
<i>And another.</i>

500
00:33:16,103 --> 00:33:17,077
Now right.

501
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,171
I can see him!
He's gonna kill me!

502
00:33:27,492 --> 00:33:29,423
Don't move.
Just do what I tell you.

503
00:33:29,939 --> 00:33:31,835
<i>Now I need you to step right.</i>

504
00:33:32,441 --> 00:33:34,845
- <i>Hang on.</i>
- Alex, I know you're scared.

505
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:36,473
You're not in the line of fire.

506
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:38,153
Just listen to 'em.

507
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:40,684
<i>Alex, don't move.
Just do what I tell you, okay?</i>

508
00:33:41,173 --> 00:33:42,780
Alex, wait!
No!

509
00:33:45,478 --> 00:33:46,564
Where is he?

510
00:33:46,689 --> 00:33:48,275
100 yards north, white building,

511
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,905
<i>second floor.
I'll cover you.</i>

512
00:34:00,325 --> 00:34:01,462
Alex, look at me.

513
00:34:01,587 --> 00:34:04,333
Everything's okay.
No, look at me.

514
00:34:08,259 --> 00:34:09,129
Status.

515
00:34:11,144 --> 00:34:12,472
Sniper's on the move.

516
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:20,381
- We gotta get this guy.
<i>- If I move, he spots me.</i>

517
00:34:20,506 --> 00:34:23,200
If he spots me, father Jack
down there's a sitting duck.

518
00:34:23,416 --> 00:34:25,453
Get behind that building
and take him.

519
00:34:25,578 --> 00:34:27,106
Alex. Look at me.

520
00:34:27,474 --> 00:34:29,345
Stay with me, okay?

521
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:40,402
This is the lamb of God

522
00:34:40,615 --> 00:34:42,350
who takes away
the sins of the world.

523
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:45,100
Have mercy on us.

524
00:35:17,846 --> 00:35:18,741
Don't move.

525
00:35:19,414 --> 00:35:20,625
Stay still!

526
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:28,917
You okay?

527
00:35:31,442 --> 00:35:32,337
Are you?

528
00:35:33,635 --> 00:35:34,353
No.

529
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,512
Get in the van. Get out of here.
I gotta call this in.

530
00:35:45,797 --> 00:35:47,269
- Oh, my God.
- What?

531
00:35:47,969 --> 00:35:49,104
He's not a visitor.

532
00:35:50,251 --> 00:35:51,310
He's human.

533
00:35:57,964 --> 00:36:00,008
I've asked a lot of you with Tyler.

534
00:36:01,373 --> 00:36:02,884
You've handled it well.

535
00:36:03,937 --> 00:36:07,009
The future of our species
depends on your leadership,

536
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,140
your judgment.

537
00:36:16,885 --> 00:36:18,760
This soldier's egg is weak...

538
00:36:21,077 --> 00:36:23,055
But it can still teach us something.

539
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,061
Our cause, our survival,

540
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:28,107
outweighs any sacrifice.

541
00:36:29,865 --> 00:36:32,917
There is no room for human emotion,

542
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,682
for weakness of any kind.

543
00:36:55,992 --> 00:36:58,238
Joshua said you passed
the empathy test.

544
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,175
I never doubted you.

545
00:37:15,412 --> 00:37:17,317
You're the world's savior tonight.

546
00:37:18,254 --> 00:37:21,409
You took a tragedy and used it
to your own advantage today.

547
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:24,380
It's why you invited me there.

548
00:37:24,505 --> 00:37:26,919
You knew they wouldn't let you
present your technology.

549
00:37:28,776 --> 00:37:32,591
But what would have happened if there
hadn't been a monsoon in Timbal?

550
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:36,529
Then Myanmar,

551
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,802
Darfur, Sri Lanka.

552
00:37:40,169 --> 00:37:43,024
There is tragedy every day
all over your world.

553
00:37:43,435 --> 00:37:45,345
So many opportunities to help.

554
00:37:48,069 --> 00:37:49,558
They think you're a God.

555
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,518
Who does that make you?

556
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,434
A believer.

557
00:37:56,801 --> 00:37:58,400
Can I tell you what I believe?

558
00:38:00,215 --> 00:38:01,726
You're not just visitors.

559
00:38:02,892 --> 00:38:04,197
You're here to stay.

560
00:38:05,298 --> 00:38:07,034
But are you here for our benefit

561
00:38:07,676 --> 00:38:08,736
or yours?

562
00:38:10,044 --> 00:38:11,783
I didn't do this for me.

563
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,105
I did it for that little girl.

564
00:38:14,457 --> 00:38:18,143
If you can do that kind of good,
I want to be part of it.

565
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,859
I want to help.

566
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:22,107
I need people I can trust

567
00:38:23,894 --> 00:38:25,117
and who trust me.

568
00:38:32,035 --> 00:38:33,748
Do you trust me, Chad?

569
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,011
Joshua.

570
00:38:45,401 --> 00:38:46,130
Why?

571
00:38:48,445 --> 00:38:49,745
Because one day,

572
00:38:50,357 --> 00:38:52,160
I'll ask a favor from you,

573
00:38:53,183 --> 00:38:54,632
and you'll comply.

574
00:39:01,366 --> 00:39:03,882
This is just a vitamin shot
to boost your immune system.

575
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,510
- Good for you two.
- Thanks for seeing me so quickly.

576
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:09,471
Let's take a look at your baby.

577
00:39:19,203 --> 00:39:20,107
What is it?

578
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,442
Nothing too serious.

579
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:24,774
I'd like to see my baby.

580
00:39:25,068 --> 00:39:26,449
I need to see my child.

581
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:27,817
You should sit.

582
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,091
I should go.

583
00:39:33,216 --> 00:39:35,956
I'm sorry, Dr. Stevens,
but I can't let you do that.

584
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:00,766
Let's go.

585
00:40:02,175 --> 00:40:03,129
Trust me.

586
00:40:07,094 --> 00:40:09,194
Why are we giving the humans
blue energy?

587
00:40:09,818 --> 00:40:11,938
Because once
they're dependent on it,

588
00:40:12,182 --> 00:40:13,637
we can turn it off.

589
00:40:23,372 --> 00:40:25,756
Alex was right.
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

590
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,842
I'll tell his father.
I owe him that.

591
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:32,220
Everything that we have done
to fight the V's,

592
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,765
to protect people,
and a human betrays us?

593
00:40:35,357 --> 00:40:38,275
Well, maybe he can give us
some insight into why.

594
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:44,078
Rise and shine, sweetheart.
You got questions to answer.

595
00:40:44,203 --> 00:40:45,734
What's your name?

596
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,572
You're not going anywhere.

597
00:40:50,855 --> 00:40:51,746
Talk.

598
00:40:52,634 --> 00:40:54,743
I can't tell you anything.

599
00:40:56,791 --> 00:40:58,093
Why did you do it?

600
00:41:01,064 --> 00:41:02,237
Tell me why.

601
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,092
Because we can't win.

602
00:41:11,846 --> 00:41:15,312
