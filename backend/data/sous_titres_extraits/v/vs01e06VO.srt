1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:01,525
<i>Previously on</i> V...

2
00:00:01,878 --> 00:00:02,818
I'm pregnant.

3
00:00:02,943 --> 00:00:05,319
Imagine what would happen
if Anna ever found out about this.

4
00:00:05,444 --> 00:00:07,916
Your family, George...
The Vs were responsible for their deaths.

5
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,770
<i>We've developed
a vitamin supplement.</i>

6
00:00:09,895 --> 00:00:12,219
Anna's tagging humans
like animals in the wild.

7
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:16,015
- It's a message from the warehouse.
- John May started the 5th column...

8
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,516
The first group of visitors
to turn against the leadership.

9
00:00:18,641 --> 00:00:20,686
We have to crush them.
Supply the FBI with a lead.

10
00:00:21,153 --> 00:00:22,043
Kyle Hobbes.

11
00:00:22,168 --> 00:00:23,553
He can train a resistance.

12
00:00:23,678 --> 00:00:24,732
Welcome to the war.

13
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,442
We need more soldiers...
An army.

14
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,818
I'll make one.

15
00:00:35,365 --> 00:00:38,999
<i>No need for regrets
for mistakes made yesterday.</i>

16
00:00:39,757 --> 00:00:41,264
<i>The past is gone.</i>

17
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:43,790
<i>No looming fate.</i>

18
00:00:43,915 --> 00:00:46,081
<i>No uncontrollable destiny.</i>

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,880
<i>No hunger.</i>

20
00:00:48,537 --> 00:00:49,787
<i>No sickness.</i>

21
00:00:50,276 --> 00:00:51,276
<i>No fear.</i>

22
00:00:51,706 --> 00:00:52,706
<i>No death.</i>

23
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:54,599
<i>Nothing ahead.</i>

24
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:56,901
<i>Nothing behind.</i>

25
00:00:57,771 --> 00:00:59,417
<i>Only stillness... </i>

26
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,770
<i>A sanctuary of peace
and tranquility.</i>

27
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,410
<i>My bliss envelops you... </i>

28
00:01:06,374 --> 00:01:07,505
<i>Protects you...</i>

29
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,679
- <i>Together we shall experience...</i>
- Look at me.

30
00:01:09,804 --> 00:01:10,820
<i>eternal joy</i>

31
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:14,740
<i>in a rapture of ecstasy
and safety.</i>

32
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,738
<i>You will bask in my light,</i>

33
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,475
<i>wrapped in the warmth
of my divine touch.</i>

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,393
She's taking your minds and your lives
in return for nothing but lies.

35
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:25,818
<i>No looking back.</i>

36
00:01:26,912 --> 00:01:28,862
<i>No worries of what will come.</i>

37
00:01:29,779 --> 00:01:31,841
- Mia.
- <i>Just safety...</i>

38
00:01:32,128 --> 00:01:33,008
I love you.

39
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,719
<i>knowing I am here</i>

40
00:01:35,983 --> 00:01:37,682
<i>invigorating</i>

41
00:01:38,552 --> 00:01:40,048
<i>bask in my light.</i>

42
00:01:40,745 --> 00:01:42,756
Anna can steal you no longer.

43
00:01:57,052 --> 00:01:59,819
The incident occurred yesterday
on the Sydney mother ship.

44
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,833
The fifth column is
becoming more active.

45
00:02:03,161 --> 00:02:05,695
Captains in the Tokyo,
Paris and Mexico city ships

46
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,111
have all reported
isolated incidents.

47
00:02:09,358 --> 00:02:11,649
The fifth column
is immune to my bliss.

48
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:14,720
They've begun to feel
human emotion...

49
00:02:15,655 --> 00:02:16,655
Empathy.

50
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,390
Love.

51
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,374
If they find a way to unify,
they could become a real threat.

52
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:25,029
Get me Joshua.

53
00:02:25,592 --> 00:02:28,641
It's time to eliminate them
before they grow any stronger.

54
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:36,145
<i>Chad Decker, WMT,</i>

55
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,492
<i>reporting live from the visitor
peace ambassador center</i>

56
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,569
<i>as we wait for Marcus,
Anna's second in command,</i>

57
00:02:42,694 --> 00:02:44,872
- <i>to address the world...</i>
- Good morning, sweetheart.

58
00:02:45,282 --> 00:02:48,267
I should be there. They probably need
peace ambassadors to help out.

59
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:50,328
It's a school day.

60
00:02:50,453 --> 00:02:52,951
They probably have plenty
of PAS down there.

61
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,927
If the visitors needed you,
they'd call, right?

62
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:01,070
What am I talking about?
They wouldn't call.

63
00:03:01,237 --> 00:03:03,759
They're from outer space.
They'd beam you up.

64
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:08,062
Don't worry, mom. We talked about this.
You have nothing to be afraid of.

65
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,022
Does this look like my scared face?

66
00:03:11,082 --> 00:03:12,233
School comes first.

67
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,068
You can go to the ship after, okay?

68
00:03:14,615 --> 00:03:15,615
Okay, mom.

69
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,216
- Love you.
- I love you.

70
00:03:29,339 --> 00:03:31,655
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for coming.

71
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,464
Later today, Anna will make
an announcement from the mother ships

72
00:03:35,742 --> 00:03:38,717
that will mark the beginning
of our "live aboard" program.

73
00:03:39,074 --> 00:03:42,676
In return for the gracious hospitality
the people of earth have shown

74
00:03:43,028 --> 00:03:45,570
by allowing Visitors
to live amongst humans,

75
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,151
we are proud to announce

76
00:03:48,397 --> 00:03:51,063
a new era in V-human relations.

77
00:03:51,778 --> 00:03:54,792
People from around the world
have applied to this program

78
00:03:55,016 --> 00:03:56,686
through our healing centers...

79
00:03:56,811 --> 00:03:59,261
Applied for the program
at the healing centers?

80
00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:02,734
- It's gotta be connected to the R-6.
- People who have been randomly chosen

81
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:05,452
to live aboard our ships
along with us.

82
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,420
Randomly selected, my ass.

83
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:11,208
First the R-6, now this.
What the hell are they up to?

84
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,627
- Thank you.
- I don't know.

85
00:04:14,015 --> 00:04:15,713
But Decker's their mouthpiece.

86
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,033
Let's get the guys set up out front.
We're back on live in ten.

87
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:22,489
Maybe we should ask him.

88
00:04:30,034 --> 00:04:33,029
I can't keep Tyler away from that ship.
I'm gonna tell him the truth.

89
00:04:33,154 --> 00:04:35,701
- It's the only way to protect him.
- Tyler's on Anna's radar.

90
00:04:35,868 --> 00:04:38,204
Any change in his behavior
will call attention to him.

91
00:04:38,329 --> 00:04:41,140
- If he doesn't believe you...
- He'll believe me.

92
00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:44,696
If he believes you,
then he'll sever all ties with the Vs.

93
00:04:44,821 --> 00:04:46,243
He'll stop going onto that ship.

94
00:04:46,784 --> 00:04:48,392
And Anna will want to know why.

95
00:04:48,517 --> 00:04:50,840
He might also want to join
the fight against them.

96
00:04:51,108 --> 00:04:53,130
You ready to put your son
into the war?

97
00:04:53,483 --> 00:04:55,463
How do I keep him away from them?

98
00:04:57,068 --> 00:04:58,973
When I figure that out,
I'll let you know.

99
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:04,302
A priest, a civvy,
a lizard and a fed.

100
00:05:04,923 --> 00:05:06,873
If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.

101
00:05:06,998 --> 00:05:09,808
Where's your army?
You bark, Hobbes. You bite, too?

102
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,060
Is that a request?

103
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,592
We have what we have.
Make it work.

104
00:05:14,025 --> 00:05:15,325
We have an army.

105
00:05:15,871 --> 00:05:17,358
We're called the 5th column.

106
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:20,042
Well, maybe you should ring them,
remind them we're in a war.

107
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:21,612
Can't locate 'em.

108
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,160
We're scattered all around
the world in different cities.

109
00:05:24,327 --> 00:05:26,203
But I can assure you, Mr. Hobbes,

110
00:05:26,328 --> 00:05:28,953
- we're a sleeping giant.
- Then we wake 'em up.

111
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:32,289
Your 5th column,
they keep their eyes on the ships?

112
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,248
Yeah.

113
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,209
Then use the ships
to your advantage.

114
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:39,171
Anna's making an announcement today.
You make your own.

115
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,550
Okay. How?

116
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,537
You get on her ship, hijack her signal,
replace it with your own...

117
00:05:44,662 --> 00:05:47,012
Tells your people you're here,
tells her you're here.

118
00:05:47,536 --> 00:05:48,722
It's a call to arms.

119
00:05:49,096 --> 00:05:51,767
But to make it count,
bloody her nose while you're at it.

120
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,937
You're on the Vs radar.
There's too much heat on you.

121
00:05:55,317 --> 00:05:57,690
- You'll never get up there.
- No, but he can.

122
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:03,268
There's too much heat
on everybody right now.

123
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,361
It's a suicide mission.

124
00:06:05,486 --> 00:06:08,659
I'm all for bloodying Anna's nose,
but we haven't planned this through yet.

125
00:06:09,226 --> 00:06:12,371
Are you paying me to sit
on my hands or man up and fight?

126
00:06:15,718 --> 00:06:17,459
I'm sorry, Hobbes.

127
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,527
You'll have to think
of a better plan.

128
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,554
Thanks again for seeing us
on such short notice.

129
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,585
I haven't been feeling well.

130
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,020
I was worried there was something
wrong with the baby.

131
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,147
Everything looks perfectly normal.

132
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,900
So I will let you get cleaned up.

133
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:45,011
The nurse'll be in in a minute.
I just want to run a few more tests.

134
00:06:49,088 --> 00:06:50,200
Beautiful.

135
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,898
You can't keep canceling
her OB appointments.

136
00:06:56,023 --> 00:06:58,714
You need to tell her the truth
before she finds out.

137
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:01,342
I tell her the truth about who I am,
I could lose her.

138
00:07:01,898 --> 00:07:04,671
I love her, Leah.
Everything that I've ever done,

139
00:07:04,796 --> 00:07:06,951
everything that I've fought for
is for her.

140
00:07:07,076 --> 00:07:08,319
And besides,

141
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,239
I'm not sure we should be
going through with her pregnancy.

142
00:07:11,406 --> 00:07:13,404
You need to decide, and quickly.

143
00:07:13,722 --> 00:07:15,309
I don't like what I'm seeing.

144
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:16,876
The growth is accelerated.

145
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:20,031
The ultrasound that I just showed her
in there was not her ultrasound.

146
00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:22,943
That was a normal human
foetus week six.

147
00:07:24,492 --> 00:07:26,236
This is her real ultrasound.

148
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,620
This is your child.

149
00:07:29,835 --> 00:07:33,252
The accelerated growth is
draining val of phosphorus.

150
00:07:33,377 --> 00:07:35,159
That's what's making her sick.

151
00:07:35,284 --> 00:07:37,706
Visitors have high amounts
of phosphorus in our bodies...

152
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:41,085
Plenty for a child to live off of
if the mother-to-be were a Visitor.

153
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,925
- Can't we give her an infusion?
- She needs a denser concentrate.

154
00:07:48,632 --> 00:07:49,746
So how do I get it?

155
00:07:49,913 --> 00:07:51,962
Humans don't have the technology
to produce it.

156
00:07:52,102 --> 00:07:54,098
The only place
to get it is on the mother ship.

157
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,218
But without it,

158
00:07:57,864 --> 00:07:59,770
she won't survive the pregnancy.

159
00:08:15,518 --> 00:08:18,821
Agent Evans,
I think I may have a lead on Hobbes.

160
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,930
Looks real.
What are you doing here?

161
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,932
You asked me a new plan.
I've got one.

162
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,767

Get us all thrown in jail?

163
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,145
Going onto that ship without Ryan.

164
00:08:42,368 --> 00:08:45,223
The feds' most wanted man walked
right in to this playpen,

165
00:08:45,348 --> 00:08:48,413
but they don't notice him
because he smells and looks like them.

166
00:08:48,538 --> 00:08:49,528
Get to the point.

167
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,406
Now is the time to get on that ship
and embed that message.

168
00:08:52,969 --> 00:08:55,242
Why are you in such a hurry
to get on the ship?

169
00:08:55,594 --> 00:08:57,303
Those lizards set me up.

170
00:08:58,061 --> 00:09:00,747
I want to know why and how
and hurt 'em real bad for it.

171
00:09:01,723 --> 00:09:04,227
There's a tactical advantage
to embedding that message today,

172
00:09:04,394 --> 00:09:05,634
we need to jump on it.

173
00:09:05,801 --> 00:09:07,337
You heard Ryan.
It's too risky.

174
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,465
I don't need ryan.
I'll do it.

175
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:10,382
How?

176
00:09:12,773 --> 00:09:14,407
Well, I got in here, didn't I?

177
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,938
- I already told you this is a mistake.
- I'm doing this with or without you.

178
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,148
Really?

179
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,984
Sneaking into the FBI is one thing.

180
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,320
Getting onto a V ship's a whole
another world.

181
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:32,237
Is it?

182
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,047
What will you do when they speak
in our native tongue?

183
00:09:35,172 --> 00:09:38,702
What happens when the core temperature
scanner says you're a human?

184
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,424
Ryan, we don't know
when Anna's gonna broadcast again.

185
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:43,457
I think we should reconsider
going up now.

186
00:09:47,776 --> 00:09:49,026
We won't go up.

187
00:09:50,378 --> 00:09:51,298
I will.

188
00:09:53,377 --> 00:09:55,483
I thought you said it was
a suicide mission?

189
00:09:55,608 --> 00:09:58,847
It is, but it's the only way I can
stop Hobbes from going up.

190
00:09:59,491 --> 00:10:01,864
They catch him, we won'tbe able
to get onto another ship,

191
00:10:02,031 --> 00:10:03,880
and the 5th column
will stay scattered.

192
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:07,147
Anna needs to be stopped.

193
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,879
And I'm the only one
that can get onto that ship.

194
00:10:35,189 --> 00:10:39,179
A typical human would react strongly to
the devastation that you just witnessed.

195
00:10:40,756 --> 00:10:42,557
Based on your neurological readings,

196
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:46,715
your situational empathy is well
within the normal range for our species.

197
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:50,475
In short, you do not
feel human emotion.

198
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:53,319
Use my results as a baseline.

199
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:56,531
Everyone on the ships
will be tested.

200
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,306
Find out who's 5th column
and who isn't.

201
00:11:14,402 --> 00:11:16,525
All right,
so I'm getting on that ship.

202
00:11:16,767 --> 00:11:19,696
It's gonna be dangerous, so we all need
to play our parts perfectly.

203
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:22,931
Here's how it lays out...

204
00:11:23,373 --> 00:11:26,560
Erica, I need a name
from the V diplomatic list.

205
00:11:28,744 --> 00:11:30,351
I need a V who's not in New York,

206
00:11:30,476 --> 00:11:32,482
and won't be coming back
to the ship soon.

207
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,649
Look for someone the same rank
and credentials that I had.

208
00:11:35,774 --> 00:11:37,658
My old uniform has to match it.

209
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:42,284
Hobbes, I need your contacts
to get me some forged papers.

210
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,352
And they gotta look good.

211
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,174
The scanner I go through
doesn't just read core temperature.

212
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:51,530
It checks my prints.

213
00:11:51,697 --> 00:11:54,171
They'll need to match the identity
of the V Erica finds.

214
00:12:02,448 --> 00:12:04,765
Now once I'm onboard,
I look like any other V.

215
00:12:06,102 --> 00:12:08,179
And as a V,
I can get where I need to go.

216
00:12:08,612 --> 00:12:10,851
I hack into the ship's
communication system,

217
00:12:10,976 --> 00:12:13,732
embed our call to arms,
hightail it home.

218
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,131
This shouldn't take
any more than a few hours,

219
00:12:16,298 --> 00:12:19,321
so when I'm down, I'll call in.
You don't hear from me by 4:00...

220
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,784
you'll know there's been a problem.

221
00:12:30,301 --> 00:12:31,751
Be careful, friend.

222
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:34,629
Thanks.

223
00:12:35,898 --> 00:12:38,340
If I don't make it back,
I want you to do something for me.

224
00:12:39,621 --> 00:12:40,621
Go to Val.

225
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:42,934
Take her to that doctor.

226
00:12:44,665 --> 00:12:46,228
Tell her the truth about me.

227
00:12:48,061 --> 00:12:51,066
It's not how I want it to go,
but she needs to know. All right?

228
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:54,129
You just make it home.

229
00:13:05,225 --> 00:13:07,494
Ryan knows what he's doing
going up in the ship.

230
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:09,467
He'll be okay.

231
00:13:10,863 --> 00:13:12,707
He's not the only one
I'm worried about.

232
00:13:13,065 --> 00:13:14,065
Your son.

233
00:13:16,503 --> 00:13:19,545
The visitors are going to announce
their "live aboard" program tonight.

234
00:13:19,712 --> 00:13:22,326
And you think Tyler's going to want
to live with them up there?

235
00:13:22,466 --> 00:13:23,677
He loves the visitors.

236
00:13:24,307 --> 00:13:26,471
The visitors took everything I had.

237
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:29,224
I don't want that to happen to you.

238
00:13:31,923 --> 00:13:34,688
How are you gonna stop Tyler
from living with the Vs?

239
00:13:36,062 --> 00:13:38,614
By taking him
to someone he loves more.

240
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,270
So...

241
00:13:44,814 --> 00:13:46,682
What's up with the fab four, Hobbes?

242
00:13:48,387 --> 00:13:49,487
You tell me.

243
00:13:50,836 --> 00:13:52,831
First one's a case...
George Sutton.

244
00:13:53,113 --> 00:13:55,041
Worked as a chemical engineer.

245
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,960
Went crazy after his family
were murdered.

246
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,004
Claimed aliens did it.

247
00:13:59,727 --> 00:14:01,527
Maybe not so crazy, right?

248
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:04,718
The priest did two tours
as an army chaplain.

249
00:14:05,284 --> 00:14:07,888
Testified against
two staff sergeants in Baghdad

250
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,307
- who broke the rules of engagement.
- Boy scout.

251
00:14:10,947 --> 00:14:11,975
And the fed?

252
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:15,520
Clean jacket,
but her ex-partner's MIA,

253
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,201
supposedly working with terrorists.

254
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,399
Whole lot of personal baggage
on her, too.

255
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,600
It's all there.

256
00:14:20,854 --> 00:14:22,360
Last one: Ryan Nichols.

257
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:23,987
He's a stockbroker.

258
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,990
Outside of a knocked-up girlfriend,
he's the cleanest of the bunch...

259
00:14:28,515 --> 00:14:29,815
Maybe too clean.

260
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,913
If he's got dirt on him,
you have to find it yourself.

261
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:36,541
They've got something over you,
don't they?

262
00:14:37,214 --> 00:14:38,670
Not for long.

263
00:14:48,832 --> 00:14:50,138
Ty! What...

264
00:14:50,665 --> 00:14:51,515
Dad.

265
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,559
I know. We made great time.

266
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:56,937
Got here ear than we expected.

267
00:14:59,449 --> 00:15:01,063
- How you doing, bud?
- Good.

268
00:15:01,655 --> 00:15:03,744
I put a new show stopper exhaust
on my bike.

269
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:04,717
Really?

270
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,661
I just got a new bike.

271
00:15:07,108 --> 00:15:08,907
T-750.
You want to go check it out?

272
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,636
- It's in the shop.
- Hell, yeah.

273
00:15:12,606 --> 00:15:14,906
And be careful. That's a lot of jam.

274
00:15:22,935 --> 00:15:24,985
What are you doing here, Erica?

275
00:15:27,828 --> 00:15:29,078
We should talk.

276
00:15:43,613 --> 00:15:45,463
<i>Welcome to the mother ship.</i>

277
00:15:48,978 --> 00:15:49,888
This way.

278
00:15:54,341 --> 00:15:55,591
Right hand, please.

279
00:16:02,614 --> 00:16:03,888
Right hand, please.

280
00:16:26,257 --> 00:16:28,820
Welcome back to the ship.
Next in line, please.

281
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,622
Is there a problem?
This visa's not working.

282
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:39,956
It didn't clear.

283
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:42,237
Run it again.

284
00:16:47,138 --> 00:16:48,757
It cleared.
Right hand, please.

285
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,347
Welcome back to the ship, Jeff.

286
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,250
Next in line, please.

287
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:04,014
Right hand, please.

288
00:17:13,556 --> 00:17:15,106
Next in line, please.

289
00:17:27,897 --> 00:17:28,897
He failed.

290
00:17:29,686 --> 00:17:33,205
His response measured 1118
on the biometric level...

291
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:36,054
Just slightly above Anna's
baseline reading, but above.

292
00:17:36,407 --> 00:17:38,185
There must be a mistake.

293
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,558
Phillip is one
of my most trusted advisors.

294
00:17:41,298 --> 00:17:42,542
I'll test him again.

295
00:17:42,837 --> 00:17:43,837
Why?

296
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,488
I've discovered the test
has a margin of error.

297
00:17:48,888 --> 00:17:49,822
How big?

298
00:17:49,947 --> 00:17:53,446
Based on the number of false positives
I've extrapolated, roughly 2%.

299
00:17:53,913 --> 00:17:55,281
If some results are wrong,

300
00:17:56,037 --> 00:17:59,160
his and others...
Shouldn't we discontinue testing?

301
00:17:59,604 --> 00:18:00,609
Keep testing.

302
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,122
Hold all those who fail.

303
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,955
I'll deal with them personally.

304
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:12,174
Vs?

305
00:18:12,736 --> 00:18:15,472
- Yeah. I'm a peace ambassador.
- Peace ambassador?

306
00:18:16,139 --> 00:18:18,444
I pass out information and...

307
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:21,926
help out at the PA Center,
that kind of stuff. It's pretty cool.

308
00:18:22,051 --> 00:18:23,298
Visitors...

309
00:18:24,048 --> 00:18:26,604
Alien ships...
It's just so amazing.

310
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:30,086
Yeah, you think
a twin 750's tough, dad?

311
00:18:30,614 --> 00:18:32,193
You should see their engine room.

312
00:18:32,683 --> 00:18:34,492
- It is something else.
- Yeah?

313
00:18:37,271 --> 00:18:38,658
Glad you wanted to see me.

314
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,149
I miss having you around.

315
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,119
Me too.

316
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,636
- I'm sorry about everything, dad.
- Sorry about what?

317
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,912
- Splitting you and mom up.
- What?

318
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,975
- I know it was my fault.
- It wasn't.

319
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:04,963
It was.

320
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:07,771
If I didn't have
my motorcycle accident

321
00:19:08,971 --> 00:19:10,721
That's not what happened.

322
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:14,861
- It's not that simple.
- Then what did happen, dad?

323
00:19:16,023 --> 00:19:17,447
Why don't you just tell me?

324
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:22,627
All you need to know

325
00:19:24,634 --> 00:19:26,144
Is it's not your fault.

326
00:19:37,451 --> 00:19:38,735
You're a good kid.

327
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,477
Thanks, dad.

328
00:20:57,443 --> 00:20:59,090
What are you doing with phosphorus?

329
00:20:59,818 --> 00:21:01,468
My supervisor sent met.

330
00:21:02,172 --> 00:21:03,872
Jeff singer. Ninth deck.

331
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,604
Come with me.

332
00:21:28,881 --> 00:21:31,706
Members of our race
are falling prey to human emotion,

333
00:21:33,226 --> 00:21:35,326
becoming immune to Anna's bliss.

334
00:21:38,762 --> 00:21:41,382
This test measures your sensibility
to this phenomenon.

335
00:21:52,981 --> 00:21:54,228
Failure means death.

336
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:00,183
<i>Anna's announcement
about the "live aboard" program</i>

337
00:22:00,308 --> 00:22:02,111
<i>is scheduled in less than an hour.</i>

338
00:22:02,663 --> 00:22:04,113
<i>Chad Decker for WMT</i>

339
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,157
From the V peace ambassador center.

340
00:22:07,787 --> 00:22:08,684
Back soon.

341
00:22:09,178 --> 00:22:10,178
Thank you.

342
00:22:11,655 --> 00:22:12,755
Here you go.

343
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,126
You're a popular.

344
00:22:18,332 --> 00:22:19,963
The Vs are a hell of a story.

345
00:22:20,594 --> 00:22:23,257
- Father...
- Jack landry. Yes, they are.

346
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,174
What can I do?

347
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:27,186
I've watching your pieces
on the centers.

348
00:22:27,353 --> 00:22:29,392
And when you spoke
about your aneurysm on tv,

349
00:22:29,517 --> 00:22:31,027
you gave a lot of people hope.

350
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,935
Many of them who were afraid of the Vs
aren't anymore, thanks to you.

351
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:37,689
What's there to be afraid of...
Miracles?

352
00:22:38,656 --> 00:22:40,358
Speaking miracles, you're diagnosed,

353
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,151
what was it, a week ago?

354
00:22:43,072 --> 00:22:44,650
Why have you waited so long?

355
00:22:45,207 --> 00:22:46,572
I'm beginning now.

356
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:49,704
We're telling the story
in five parts for sweeps.

357
00:22:52,394 --> 00:22:53,788
How can I help you, father?

358
00:22:55,991 --> 00:22:58,552
Some of my parishioners are worried,
the Vs are doing something

359
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,232
in their centers that...

360
00:23:01,322 --> 00:23:02,755
we're not being told about.

361
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,680
I'm just asking for you to
make sure that they are safe,

362
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:10,816
Before you endorse healing centers.
That's all I'm asking.

363
00:23:17,398 --> 00:23:18,866
Good luck with sweeps.

364
00:23:22,562 --> 00:23:24,393
It's Erica.
I haven't heard from you.

365
00:23:24,518 --> 00:23:26,629
I'm getting worried.
Please call me.

366
00:23:30,144 --> 00:23:32,201
Do you want to tell me
what's really going on?

367
00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:35,538
- Where's tyler?
- On the phone with his girlfriend.

368
00:23:36,906 --> 00:23:39,348
We both know
you didn't bring tyler here for him.

369
00:23:40,078 --> 00:23:41,733
And you wouldn't be here,

370
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:44,160
if you didn't need something.

371
00:23:46,835 --> 00:23:48,092
I need you to keep him.

372
00:23:49,478 --> 00:23:51,304
Things are crazy
in the city with work,

373
00:23:52,915 --> 00:23:55,459
- and I'm barely home.
- Work has always been busy.

374
00:23:55,584 --> 00:23:57,352
That's never been a problem.
Why now?

375
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,944
You have noticed the world
has turned upside down

376
00:24:00,111 --> 00:24:01,314
since they arrived.

377
00:24:01,738 --> 00:24:03,896
I'm working triple time, Please.

378
00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:05,943
Joe, he needs you.

379
00:24:07,252 --> 00:24:08,761
I need you to do this.

380
00:24:10,172 --> 00:24:11,603
What are you not telling me?

381
00:24:13,531 --> 00:24:14,331
Nothing.

382
00:24:20,427 --> 00:24:22,543
I'll take him.
Of course, I'll take him.

383
00:24:24,124 --> 00:24:25,997
But you need to know that he thinks.

384
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:29,258
That he's the reason
why we split up.

385
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,053
We can't let him carry that weight.

386
00:24:33,136 --> 00:24:36,391
It's time that we told him the truth
about who he really is.

387
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,653
It's nice to meet you.

388
00:24:49,725 --> 00:24:51,199
Ryan's an old friend.

389
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:52,424
Here you go.

390
00:24:53,152 --> 00:24:54,117
Come on in.

391
00:24:56,153 --> 00:24:59,417
I haven't been able to reach him.
You haven't talked to him recently?

392
00:24:59,824 --> 00:25:01,999
I've been trying,
but he hasn't been answering.

393
00:25:03,006 --> 00:25:06,014
He said he was gonna be working late,
I'm sure he's just busy.

394
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:07,588
I'm sure he'll call soon.

395
00:25:08,404 --> 00:25:10,975
- I'm sorry. It is such a mess.
- That's okay.

396
00:25:22,262 --> 00:25:23,159
You're...

397
00:25:26,712 --> 00:25:27,570
Pregnant.

398
00:25:29,841 --> 00:25:32,022
We're not really telling people yet.

399
00:25:33,754 --> 00:25:35,704
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

400
00:25:36,448 --> 00:25:37,958
- Do you have kids?
- Two.

401
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:42,519
Just...

402
00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:44,834
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

403
00:25:48,044 --> 00:25:50,214
- Just tell ryan I stopped by.
- Okay.

404
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:51,908
Sure.

405
00:26:07,046 --> 00:26:09,120
I've been thinking
about what you said

406
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,868
about your parishioners.

407
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:15,192
- I've got questions.
- I may not have the answers.

408
00:26:16,391 --> 00:26:17,591
Then who does?

409
00:26:18,596 --> 00:26:19,361
You.

410
00:26:21,217 --> 00:26:23,136
- Me?
- You have access to the ships,

411
00:26:23,261 --> 00:26:24,026
to Anna.

412
00:26:24,535 --> 00:26:27,543
You want the truth?
That's the place to look, not here.

413
00:26:28,633 --> 00:26:30,987
You want me to go behind Anna's back

414
00:26:31,112 --> 00:26:32,632
and do what?

415
00:26:33,741 --> 00:26:35,843
Make sure the Vs won't harm us.

416
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,472
You gotta give me something here.

417
00:26:40,077 --> 00:26:42,892
- A place to start.
- I already gave you a place to start.

418
00:26:44,392 --> 00:26:46,897
I've got nothing to give you
except frightened parishioners

419
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,523
in a confessional with a hunch.

420
00:26:50,366 --> 00:26:52,776
And you expect me
to risk my entire career

421
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:54,445
On a hunch?

422
00:26:55,343 --> 00:26:57,477
You already have a hunch
something's wrong.

423
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:59,478
You wouldn't be here if you didn't.

424
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,698
- You won that race.
- Brandon won that race.

425
00:27:05,823 --> 00:27:07,977
- He didn't, It was you.
- That was another time.

426
00:27:08,102 --> 00:27:09,525
You took, you went past him,

427
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:11,545
50 ft before the end.
You don't remember?

428
00:27:12,245 --> 00:27:13,065
Work?

429
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,542
<i>Ryan's not back yet.</i>

430
00:27:17,935 --> 00:27:20,503
- <i>Have you heard from him?</i>
- I haven't from anybody.

431
00:27:20,686 --> 00:27:21,761
<i>I'm worried.</i>

432
00:27:22,578 --> 00:27:23,723
What if he's hurt

433
00:27:24,608 --> 00:27:25,523
or worse?

434
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:29,120
I was thinking of going up there.

435
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:32,267
Going up there could make it worse.
Stay put.

436
00:27:32,392 --> 00:27:34,527
I'm headed back.
I'll meet you at the church.

437
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:36,221
Right.

438
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:56,165
Let me guess.
You gotta go back for work?

439
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:58,009
Good guess.
That okay?

440
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,465
Dad asked if I could stay with him.

441
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:05,305
I know
you weren't thinking that, but...

442
00:28:05,873 --> 00:28:07,036
You want to stay?

443
00:28:09,185 --> 00:28:10,354
Yeah. Is that okay?

444
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,444
Promise me you won't do
anything I wouldn't do.

445
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:24,619
Which leaves?

446
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,788
- Nothin'.
- Fine.

447
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:31,016
- I love you.
- I love you, too, mom.

448
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:54,940
He failed.

449
00:28:59,431 --> 00:29:00,613
You're not from here.

450
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,157
You're fifth column?

451
00:29:03,611 --> 00:29:04,515
No, I'm not.

452
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,908
Samuel followed you from the atrium
after you boarded the ship.

453
00:29:08,557 --> 00:29:10,296
He saw you react to the baby.

454
00:29:11,287 --> 00:29:14,536
He saw you take the phosphorous,
and I saw you fail the test.

455
00:29:22,878 --> 00:29:23,907
Joshua.

456
00:29:26,828 --> 00:29:28,487
It's good to meet you.

457
00:29:33,934 --> 00:29:36,018
This is Samuel, he's with us, too.

458
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:40,680
Ryan. How many of us on these ships?

459
00:29:40,805 --> 00:29:42,294
Not many, and less soon,

460
00:29:42,461 --> 00:29:44,468
Anna's started testing.
How many on the ground?

461
00:29:44,593 --> 00:29:47,465
We're strong in numbers,
but we're not organized.

462
00:29:47,823 --> 00:29:49,311
What are you doing up here?

463
00:29:49,478 --> 00:29:52,957
I'm here to embed a message in
Anna's announcement, a call to arms.

464
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,937
Good, we're gonna need an army.

465
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,669
Anna's birthing soldiers.

466
00:29:59,508 --> 00:30:01,098
How much time do we have?

467
00:30:01,343 --> 00:30:03,592
Not very much unless we can stop it.

468
00:30:03,797 --> 00:30:05,448
You have to get off this ship,

469
00:30:05,573 --> 00:30:07,683
warn the other
Fifth Column on the ground.

470
00:30:07,808 --> 00:30:11,100
- I've gotta embed that message.
- I'll do it. You go.

471
00:30:11,707 --> 00:30:14,093
If they catch you here,
there'll be nothing I can do.

472
00:30:14,472 --> 00:30:15,797
Those soldiers...

473
00:30:16,822 --> 00:30:18,245
you need to stop 'em.

474
00:30:21,832 --> 00:30:23,343
How will I contact you?

475
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:29,685
John May had a comms device...

476
00:30:30,797 --> 00:30:32,382
untraceable, outdated tech.

477
00:30:32,507 --> 00:30:34,832
It was in Reedsville
last time he used it.

478
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,574
- Find it.
- I will.

479
00:30:41,962 --> 00:30:43,497
The phosphorous...

480
00:30:47,443 --> 00:30:49,084
It's for a human woman?

481
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,418
- Yes.
- You have any idea what that means?

482
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,135
I do.

483
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:59,240
But I've got no choice.
She'll die without it.

484
00:30:59,864 --> 00:31:03,842
Once you give it to her,
Ryan, there's no going back...

485
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:06,039
Ever.

486
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,215
<i>Morning, sweetheart.</i>

487
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,118
<i>I should be there, they probably need
peace ambassadors to help out.</i>

488
00:31:20,285 --> 00:31:21,780
<i>Well, Ty, it's a school day.</i>

489
00:31:21,905 --> 00:31:23,510
Where are we with Tyler?

490
00:31:24,036 --> 00:31:26,270
He seems to have calmed
his mother's fears.

491
00:31:26,782 --> 00:31:28,180
Yes, he has.

492
00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:31,671
But he's still not here
on the ship with you.

493
00:31:33,977 --> 00:31:36,538
There will always be
obstacles in your way.

494
00:31:37,488 --> 00:31:41,477
It's not if you remove them,
but how.

495
00:31:43,445 --> 00:31:44,537
Get him.

496
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,179
You haven't heard
from Georgie at all?

497
00:31:52,346 --> 00:31:55,327
- Not since this morning.
- Damn it. I told him to meet me here.

498
00:31:56,859 --> 00:31:58,535
Have you seen or talked to Georgie?

499
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,155
Yeah, he went up there,
to the U.F.O.

500
00:32:01,926 --> 00:32:03,908
What? When?

501
00:32:04,129 --> 00:32:05,429
A couple hours ago.

502
00:32:05,554 --> 00:32:07,984
He asked me a weapon
he could go through security with.

503
00:32:08,109 --> 00:32:10,445
You knew?
You let him go up there alone?

504
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:13,180
- What kind of person are you?
- A realist.

505
00:32:15,371 --> 00:32:18,738
A realist would know that the only damn
thing Georgie can do is die up there!

506
00:32:18,863 --> 00:32:20,395
Why did you send him up there?

507
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,400
A realist knows that Ryan is more
important to the cause than Georgie.

508
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:27,570
If Ryan was in trouble, it was an
acceptable risk to send Georgie up...

509
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:30,864
- That was not your call to make!
- You need Ryan. He's a V.

510
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,026
He's got access and knowledge
Georgie doesn't.

511
00:32:34,134 --> 00:32:37,538
Now Georgie, like it or not,
is acceptable collateral.

512
00:32:38,778 --> 00:32:40,457
Now you can't get used to that,

513
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,253
you've already lost.

514
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,152
<i>Good evening.</i>

515
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:36,701
<i>It is with great
pleasure that I announce you</i>

516
00:33:36,826 --> 00:33:38,932
<i>the commencement
of our "Live Aboard" program.</i>

517
00:33:40,106 --> 00:33:42,945
<i>Our guests will observe
the Visitor way of life,</i>

518
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:46,225
<i>have full access to the

530
00:34:39,131 --> 00:34:41,373
<i>Peace always.</i>

531
00:34:48,284 --> 00:34:50,518
<i>Welcome to the New York mother ship.</i>

532
00:34:50,643 --> 00:34:54,450
<i>There are guided tours departing from
the welcome platform every 15 minutes.</i>

533
00:35:05,616 --> 00:35:06,850
Jeff Singer.

534
00:35:17,029 --> 00:35:19,690
- Georgie.
- Go be with your wife, Ryan.

535
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,793
She and your child need you.

536
00:35:26,737 --> 00:35:28,965
Long live the Fifth Column!

537
00:35:47,622 --> 00:35:50,966
The Fifth Column embedded a message
in your announcement this evening.

538
00:35:51,091 --> 00:35:53,916
- How?
- A human snuck away from a tour group,

539
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,486
killed one of our guards.

540
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,269
He's in our custody.

541
00:35:57,556 --> 00:36:00,251
We believe he had help.

542
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,972
We'll find out who he was
working with soon enough.

543
00:36:03,193 --> 00:36:04,817
What did the message say?

544
00:36:06,446 --> 00:36:07,873
"John May lives."

545
00:36:11,906 --> 00:36:13,717
Everything's falling into place.

546
00:36:15,122 --> 00:36:18,309
The Fifth Column on the ground
has been in hiding for too long.

547
00:36:18,627 --> 00:36:21,035
This message will give them
the confidence to come out,

548
00:36:21,202 --> 00:36:23,680
and when they do, we'll
be waiting for them.

549
00:36:25,011 --> 00:36:26,558
With the launch of the program,

550
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,474
we'll win the hearts and
minds of the humans up here

551
00:36:29,932 --> 00:36:32,659
while we crush the
Fifth Column down there.

552
00:36:39,605 --> 00:36:40,955
How are you feeling?

553
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:44,243
I'm tired. I'm glad you're
home, though. I really missed you.

554
00:36:44,859 --> 00:36:46,232
I missed you, too.

555
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,588
A friend of yours
stopped by today...

556
00:36:48,713 --> 00:36:49,965
Georgie Sutton.

557
00:36:51,422 --> 00:36:53,224
- Georgie?
- Yeah.

558
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:55,561
What'd he say?

559
00:36:55,686 --> 00:36:58,882
He stopped by to say hi,
said we made a nice family.

560
00:36:59,406 --> 00:37:00,828
He was happy for us.

561
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:03,887
He said you'd have his number
if you wanted to call him.

562
00:37:05,061 --> 00:37:05,974
Listen.

563
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:09,935
I gotta go back to work.
How about I make you a nice cup of tea,

564
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:13,183
- then I'll tuck you in?
- That sounds really nice.

565
00:37:51,444 --> 00:37:53,496
Each of you has failed my test.

566
00:37:54,688 --> 00:37:57,107
Your allegiance to me
has fallen under question.

567
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:01,121
This is your opportunity
to redeem yourselves.

568
00:38:13,999 --> 00:38:15,646
There's your margin of error.

569
00:38:16,775 --> 00:38:20,214
Those who just took their lives
have proven their devotion to me.

570
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:23,884
This test will cost countless
others their lives before we're done.

571
00:38:27,802 --> 00:38:28,807
Skin them.

572
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,221
You should have never let him
get on that ship!

573
00:38:41,346 --> 00:38:42,622
I made a judgment call.

574
00:38:42,747 --> 00:38:45,292
You're more valuable to the team
than him, you know that.

575
00:38:45,417 --> 00:38:47,976
- He was my friend.
- Hurting him won't change anything.

576
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:50,887
Georgie's stuck up there.
Let's put our heads together and

577
00:38:51,012 --> 00:38:53,368
figure out how to get him back,
we're gonna need him.

578
00:38:53,493 --> 00:38:57,209
- We'll get Georgie back.
- Yeah, then I deal with you.

579
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:58,752
Yeah.

580
00:38:59,949 --> 00:39:01,446
What are they gonna do to him?

581
00:39:02,229 --> 00:39:05,133
They won't kill him, not right away.

582
00:39:05,412 --> 00:39:07,427
- So we have a window?
- A short one.

583
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,114
Getting back up on that ship...

584
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:10,681
it won't be easy, not now.

585
00:39:11,564 --> 00:39:14,309
You put my friend on that ship.

586
00:39:14,808 --> 00:39:16,979
You better make damn sure
we get him back.

587
00:39:19,397 --> 00:39:22,359
There's no more shuttles tonight.
We have to wait until morning.

588
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:26,134
We can pray, that Georgie's
sacrifice was not for nothing.

589
00:39:34,076 --> 00:39:37,047
If I had been here, maybe Georgie
wouldn't have gone up in that ship.

590
00:39:37,276 --> 00:39:40,168
No. You were where you
were supposed to be.

591
00:39:41,189 --> 00:39:44,505
Driving away from that
house tonight without Tyler,

592
00:39:46,234 --> 00:39:47,814
without my son...

593
00:39:48,955 --> 00:39:50,846
What kind of mother
just leaves her child?

594
00:39:51,337 --> 00:39:53,101
Tyler's on the Vs radar.

595
00:39:53,463 --> 00:39:57,019
You did it to protect your son,
that's what you did by leaving him.

596
00:39:57,542 --> 00:39:59,043
At least he's safe, right?

597
00:40:00,656 --> 00:40:01,748
He's safe.

598
00:40:07,952 --> 00:40:11,099
Lisa. What are you doing here?

599
00:40:12,555 --> 00:40:13,744
I missed you.

600
00:40:18,526 --> 00:40:19,666
Come on in.

601
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,582
