Previously on the oc

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,300
I can't believe in a couple of hours we're going to be on that stage in our cap and gowns.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,820
Went back to my old office.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,390
The place looked worse than ever.

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,430
You want to go back.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,450
Oh,my God,it's him.

7
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,170
Kaitlin.
Dr.Roberts!

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,910
All the older kids,they've graduated.

9
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,640
Now I can rule Harbor.

10
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:21,730
Oh,my God,okay.

11
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,740
I'm going to get him to pull the car over so we can finally finish this!

12
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,440
"We are happy to announce that your application has been approved.

13
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,440
" I start in January.

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,350
I figured Brown was a little Vanity Fair for my taste,and now I'm considering the Sorbonne.

15
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,560
One more Cooper family hug.

16
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,680
Marissa!

17
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,260
No.

18
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,370
You were the first person I met here.

19
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,080
I'd kind of like to be the last person to say good-bye.

20
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,260
5 months later

21
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,640
Hello?

22
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,700
Hi.

23
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,700
Right now,no.

24
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,590
Yeah.

25
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,710
Yeah,okay.

26
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,090
I'll be right there.

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,700
Is he here?

28
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,080
Thank you.You've been very helpful.

29
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,180
Hey,Ryan,you there?

30
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,820
I just want to talk to you for a minute.

31
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,750
Come on.We miss you!

32
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,900
We're worried about you.

33
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,160
Hey,Kaitlin,why aren't you in school?

34
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,530
Because it's 8:00 at night and a Saturday.

35
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,480
Oh,that's nice.

36
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,580
Well,I guess I'm going to get going.

37
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,680
Where are you going?

38
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,610
You know you're not supposed to be driving at night anymore.

39
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,140
Great boots,baby.

40
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,420
Mom,maybe I should go with you.

41
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,560
Hey,Ryan.

42
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,580
Come on in.

46
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:36,170
(36 hours earlier)
So Friday morning,a little check-in before the weekend.

47
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:39,240
I'm still here,kicking it Newport style.

48
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,470
I can't believe I just said that.

49
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,150
But,uh,yeah,things are good.

50
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,000
Ryan's decision to defer college seems to be working out well.

51
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,560
He's got a new place,new job,made some new friends.

52
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,750
Sandy Cohen is doing what he does best,fighting the man,sticking up for the little guy.

53
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,000
I don't care if a plea helps the judge make his tee time.

54
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,250
Listen,listen,I've got to go.My kid's here.

55
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,480
All right.

56
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,450
Big news,the other day I went roast beef,he went turkey.

57
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:14,020
Roast beef wasn't as rare as I like,but he's really turned me on to the spicy mustard.

58
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,370
And my mom,she's more of a honey mustard gal,

59
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,860
which I discovered the other day when she invited me to join her for a Newpsie luncheon.

60
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,730
They're actually not that bad if you take the time to get to know them.

61
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,270
And that Teran,one of the great dry wits.

62
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,210
And I said,"Honey,that is not toothpaste.

63
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,210
" "It's not toothpaste.

64
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,550
" Tell us another.

65
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,970
Although she's not a fan of tuna,but do you know who is?

66
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,010
This is the shot.

67
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,980
Me and your dad have really bonded.

68
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,180
Been a lot of that,me and adults bonding.

69
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,430
No!

70
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,440
How could he miss that?

71
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,220
Although I do see Kaitlin from time to time.

72
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,720
You'll never guess who she's befriended- Brad and Eric Ward,Luke's twin brothers.

73
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,190
They seem to be a chip right off Luke's block.

74
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,570
Taylor sent me some pics from Paris- did you get them,too?

75
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,290
Her e-mail was in French.I'm not quite sure what it said.

76
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,960
Maybe your French is better than mine.

77
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,350
Anyway,it was good to catch up.

78
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,880
Only a couple more months until I'm at RISD and we're together.

79
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:21,690
xxxxxxxx

80
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,290
boycott caged chicken

81
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,170
Summer,we got to get out on the quad.This thing' going down,like,right now.

82
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,770
Chafe,hey,um,what are we protesting?

83
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,340
The chickens,man.It's the chickens!

84
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,090
Right,okay,just give me a sec.

85
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,050
Every second that goes by,another chicken is caged.

86
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,630
Then let's get out there.

87
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,560
Yeah.

88
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,820
What?

89
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,900
I'm sorry,maybe I didn't understand you correctly.

90
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:15,600
Did you seriously just ask if there was a comic book based on the X-Men movie?

91
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,530
Hey,sweetheart.

92
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,440
How's work?

93
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,630
Uh,I'm worried,Mom.

94
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,400
I'm worried about the future of America.

95
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,160
Leon.

96
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,590
The whole world's going to hell.
Hey,Leon.

97
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,720
I brought some...
Another care package for Ryan?

98
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,990
Well,just a few things: coffee,bagels,cereal,

99
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,680
and I was hoping you could put in some comic books,but nothing too dark.

100
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,560
I'm sure some Archie and Jughead will cheer him right up.

101
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,260
Seth.

102
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,760
I don't know what you're expecting,Mom.The guy's changed.

103
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:52,450
I will take the care package over where'll it'll sit next to all the other ones he hasn't opened in the last five months.

104
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,840
Why don't you invite him for dinner?

105
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,290
He didn't go to Marissa's funeral.

106
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:00,320
You really think he wants to come over for family dinner at the Cohen's?

107
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,930
Julie!

108
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:31,130
Julie,what on God's formerly green Earth are you doing?

109
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,890
Oh,hi.

110
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:32,900
Am I making too much noise?

111
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,860
For the people who live in San Diego,no,but for the rest of us,yes.

112
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,070
I was surveying the yard this morning.

113
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,260
I think Ernesto has gotten sloppy with these scrubs.

114
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,540
Julie,stop it.

115
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,470
Julie,stop it.

116
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,160
Turn that...Put that thing down.

117
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,750
Take off the goggles and talk to me.

118
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,920
That would also require your removing the kerchief from around your mouth.Thank you.

119
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,240
You want to hire new landscapers?I'll be happy to do the interviews.

120
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,720
That's a good idea,honey.
Listen to me.

121
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:01,300
I know that all this busybody business is your way of coping with an unspeakable grief,

122
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,260
but you're either going 100 miles an hour at the bushes or you're catatonic in bed.

123
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,880
Oh,I'm just so tired from all the yard work.

124
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,990
Julie,I'm not saying get over it.

125
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,050
I'm not telling you to move on.

126
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,410
I want you to take as long as you need,but would you please just let me in?

127
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,590
Just let me help.

128
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,760
Okay...

129
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,240
you hire the landscapers.

130
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:27,970
I'm going to go plug in my glue gun and finish those sea grass placemats I started last night.

131
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,570
Thanks,hon.

132
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,020
Hey,Kaitlin,can I give you a ride to school?

133
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,580
Thanks.

134
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,260
You know,it's nothing personal.

135
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,230
She ignores me,too.

136
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,730
I'm starting to think it's a good thing.

137
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,080
Ryan!

138
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,410
Ryan!

139
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,220
Seth,go away.I'm sleeping.

140
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,690
You're sleeping?

141
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,740
And you're talking?

142
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:08,120
Ryan,I don't even see how that's possible unless you're talking in your sleep.

143
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,940
Hey,look,you're awake.
Package from your mom.Thank you.

144
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,460
Yeah.

145
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,340
Aren't you going to invite me in?

146
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,540
So the utility closet is the new pool house.Things change.

147
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,450
It's the Seth Ryan time that counts.

148
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,700
I'm tired Seth.I work nights.

149
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,570
Right,but you don't work tonight,I checked with your boss,

150
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,870
which is why I'm inviting you to dinner with us.

151
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:31,120
Just show up.Eat some food,let my parents see that you're still alive.

152
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,170
It'd mean a lot to them,and it'd mean a lot to me.

153
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,170
Yeah,okay,sure,I'll see you tonight.
Great.

154
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,800
Hey,what are you doing?

155
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,680
I was going to get some ice cream or something.

156
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,790
Okay.

157
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,490
xxxxxxxxx

158
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,440
xxxxxxxxxxxx

159
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,530
they're chickens

160
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,570
They can't defend themselves.

161
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,650
What are they going to do,unionize?

162
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,600
Strike for better living conditions?

163
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,590
It is up to us,man,to speak for them!

164
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,180
Give poultry a voice!

165
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,990
Chicken lovers of the world,unite!

166
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,410
I love chicken.Nuggets are delicious.

167
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,450
It is people like you keeping the chickens from flying free.

168
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,570
Chickens can't fly.

169
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,950
Oh,who are you to say that chickens can't fly.

170
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:19,660
All it takes is one brave chicken to spread his wings and fly into the abyss.

171
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,140
Yeah.

172
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,120
Thanks,Chafe.

173
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:28,610
Hello.

174
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,120
Bonjour!

175
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,340
Taylor?

176
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,330
Oh,my God.

177
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,730
I think you mean mon Dieu,Summer.

178
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,200
Yes,c'est moi.

179
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,450
How's Paris?

180
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,990
Incroyable.

181
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,180
You know,being an expat totally suits me.

182
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,260
Except that I miss you.

183
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,330
You can only parlez so much Francais until you start to get a little nostalgic for the motherland.

184
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,280
Summer!

185
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,500
One sec,Taylor.

186
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,760
The copy shop is about to close.

187
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,460
We got to run off some more flyers.

188
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,540
Totally.

189
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,860
Tell them to use the recycled paper.

190
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,670
Taylor,you know what?I actually have to go.

191
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,100
Oh,pas un problème.

192
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,450
Well,it was great to talk to you.

193
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,510
Listen,don't be a stranger,and have a great time in Paris.

194
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,790
Vive la France,Summer.

195
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,520
Vive la France!

196
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,460
Can I get a little more coffee?

197
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,440
Thank you.

198
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,320
Okay,taste this and tell me if it's ready.

199
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:34,980
It's hot!

200
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,220
It is so hot!
Did I overcook it?

201
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,320
It is definitely not undercooked.

202
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,330
table's set for four.Actually feels kind of weird.

203
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,400
Well,things have been a little weird around here until lately.

204
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,830
Tonight might not be any different.

205
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,300
We shouldn't be expecting any miracles.

206
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,140
No zippy one-liners?
Not a lot of smiles.

207
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,400
A few grunts.An occasional shrug.

208
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,280
Yeah,it'll be just like old times.
I'm looking forward to it.

209
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,540
He'll be here any minute.

210
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,570
So,ready or not,the pasta is coming off the stove.

211
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,570
Oh,stand back,son.She's ready to blow.

212
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,080
'Cause it's hot,that's funny.

213
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,050
Hey,man,good to see you.

214
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,730
I heard you making plans with that kid.I didn't think you were going to show.

215
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,510
I wouldn't miss it.

216
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,490
All right,you drew that guy.

217
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,780
No,no.Not tonight.

218
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,950
What about him?

219
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,300
What are you,crazy?

220
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,830
No.I'm good.

221
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,340
All right.

222
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,740
Well,I thought dinner was excellent.

223
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,100
Do you think anything happened to him?

224
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,530
Ryan,it's Sandy again.

225
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,870
The microwave still works,if you feel like dropping by.

226
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,810
And,even if you don't,please call,huh?

227
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,870
Let us know you're okay.

228
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,030
Should we call the police?

229
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,080
Hospitals?
No.Mom,he's fine.

230
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:35,130
Well,he's not,you know,fine,but he's not coming.

231
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:38,910
Well,even if Ryan didn't want to come,he would have called,Ryan always calls.

232
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,340
Where are you going?

233
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,020
I'm going to try and talk to him.

234
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,080
no offense,Dad,but I don't think he is going to be in the mood for one of your pep talks right now,

235
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,200
as inspiring and motivational as they usually are.

236
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,390
I'll go.

237
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,990
Thanks for the compliment,however backhanded.Are you sure?

238
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,840
Do you want your father to go with you?

239
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,510
No,I got it.

240
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,650
Dude,this place is crawling with Security.

241
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,300
You really think it's the best place to smoke up?

242
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:13,910
They're just a bunch of rent-a-cops,and this shwag you guys gave me is barely pot anyway.

243
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,210
We might as well be smoking dirt.
Sorry.

244
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,410
The guy said that's all he had.

245
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,270
Yeah,just blame it on your lame dealer.

246
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:22,450
But,if I don't get an "A" in chemistry,I have only you two to blame.

247
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,490
So,less whining,more lab reporting.

248
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,540
Oh,no.

249
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,890
What?

250
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,530
Cops?

251
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,610
No.

252
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:44,110
Who's that skank with Dr.Roberts?

253
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,060
I know that chick.

254
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,520
Oh,yeah.That's Gloria.

255
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,090
Gloria?

256
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,250
Why does that sound familiar?

257
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,790
She used to be friends with our mom.

258
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:55,320
Before Dr.Roberts divorced her.

259
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:03,200
So that's the step-monster?

260
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:12,350
xxxxxxxxx

261
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,410
I'm trying to hold it together here,but...

262
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:48,910
I'm sorry.

263
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,430
I know you're doing the college thing,I know I'm supposed to give you space.

264
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,960
Just,um...

265
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,230
call when you can,okay?Bye.

266
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:58,490
Dude,I hear that kid from the bar is going to get his ass kicked.

267
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,310
Do it!

268
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,520
Do it!

269
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,640
Hey,Summer,you probably can't hear your phone right now

270
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,450
because of all the noise at your awesome college party.

271
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,140
I hope it's awesome.

272
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,910
I realize that sounded sarcastic,but,genuinely,I hope you're having a good night.

273
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,630
I'm just in some sketchy neighborhood trying to find Ryan.

274
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,570
Hey,it's your turn to jam on the didg.

275
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,170
Okay,I'll just be there in a sec,okay?

276
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,190
Okay.Is everything all right?

277
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,520
Yeah.

278
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,940
It's just,when I left to move out here,everything was kind of a mess at home.

279
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,800
Well,it's about to get worse.

280
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,390
If the polar ice caps keep melting at their current rate,all of Newport Beach is going to be underwater in ten years.

281
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,040
Right.

282
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,750
Well,it's a little more than that.

283
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,700
Everyone hasn't really moved on like I have.

284
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,190
I think my friends need me.

285
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,530
Hey,Summer,wherever you go...

286
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,870
there you are.

287
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,660
Not to sound like my mom,but I'm worried about him.

288
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,350
He could be in real trouble this time.

289
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,170
Hello.

290
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,700
Julie!My God!Are you all right?

291
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,160
What happened?Was there an earthquake I didn't hear?

292
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,330
No.Help me.

293
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,270
I was just trying to rearrange some furniture.

294
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,180
I got some very helpful tips from HGTV.

295
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,180
Oh,great,and they suggested that you try to move a built-in?

296
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,770
I didn't know it was a built-in.

297
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,130
Well,it's not anymore.

298
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,190
Mom,what are you doing?

299
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,720
Rearranging the furniture?

300
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,850
It's a built-in.

301
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,460
Yes,thank you.

302
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,850
Dr.Roberts wasn't there to help you?

303
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,910
Yeah,Neil.Where have you been?

304
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,660
I had a procedure.

305
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,560
Emergency tummy tuck.

306
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,190
Thank God you were there to prevent a tragedy from occurring.

307
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,750
I have no feeling in my extremities.

308
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,140
I'm sure you have a pill for that.

309
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,170
Back off,Neil.

310
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,530
I was almost just killed by your heinous furniture.

311
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,680
It's mahogany.

312
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,980
It was original with the house.

313
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,950
Well,man,you do draw a crowd.

314
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,680
They haven't seen a human punching bag before.

315
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,700
Here's your money.You earned it.
No,no.

316
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,490
Keep it.

317
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,170
Suit yourself.

318
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,290
How you going to pay for your hospital bill?

319
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,930
I'll see you.

320
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,760
Hey,man.

321
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,570
I saw your little performance.This is very Fight Club.

322
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,240
Of course,at the end of that movie,it turns out Edward Norton's insane.

323
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,000
Sorry I missed dinner.

324
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,470
Well,not as sorry as my parents.

325
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,280
You want to tell them about your new vocation,or should I?

326
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:43,670
I'm not going to tell them about it,and neither are you.

327
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,980
Sorry.

328
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,590
Just forget it.

329
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,690
Well,I don't know.Sandy's got a really good memory.

330
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,170
It's not going to be so easy for him to forget the kid he adopted,

331
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,810
and my mom's still kind of fond of you,so...

332
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,060
I'm doing you guys a favor staying away.

333
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,290
You're doing us a favor?
Face it,man.I bring trouble.

334
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,630
Trey,Volchok,you and your family- you're...

335
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:05,040
you're better off without me.
It's not true.It's not your fault.

336
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,780
Any of it.

337
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,690
I'm not going to go anywhere until you come with me.

338
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,750
Yeah?What are you going to do?You going to fight me?

339
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,470
Well,seeing as how you don't fight back...

340
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,480
I just don't any more,okay?

341
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,620
Pancakes extra fluffy.

342
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,480
Bacon extra crispy.

343
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,360
So start talking.

344
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,030
If you think you can ply me with food...

345
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,970
you're right,this bacon is delicious.
Thank you.

346
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,280
But I already told you everything last night.

347
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,830
Yes,you gave us the facts- he's working,he's busy,he forgot.

348
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,580
Yeah,but we're not buying it.
That's what he said.

349
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,030
What are you looking for from me?

350
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,590
Reading between the lines.
Subtext?

351
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,260
How'd he look?

352
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,220
Uh,he's looked better.

353
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,770
But he's looked worse.

354
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:53,750
You know,he might have cut himself shaving or something,uh,had a few nicks here and there.

355
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,040
He was bleeding?
The bleeding had stopped.

356
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,530
You know,they actually have coffee at work,which is where I'm going.

357
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:04,080
So thank you very much for breakfast,and if I hear of anything else I will let you know.

358
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:08,980
And,you guys,probably best just to give him a little more time.

359
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,240
How much more time until we can't reach him?

360
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm going to check in on Ryan right after work.

361
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,020
Cohen!

362
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,300
I was just looking for you.

363
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,510
Summer,what are you doing here?

364
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,270
I got your message.

365
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,750
Oh,I'm sorry,I didn't...

366
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,120
mean for you to,uh...

367
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,660
It sounded like an emergency.

368
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,320
Oh,uh...

369
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:53,140
Yeah,no,it kind of is.

370
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,900
Well,I'm here to help.

371
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,440
I'm so glad you came home for me.

372
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,780
And for Ryan.
Yeah,no,that's what I meant.

373
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,590
Right.

374
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,640
Hey,Kaitlin...

375
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,450
didn't hear you come in.

376
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,810
Yeah,with your manly grunts,how could you?

377
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,460
It's important to keep in shape.

378
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,070
They say sex is a really good form of exercise,

379
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,240
although I doubt you're getting any with my mother these days.

380
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,240
Our personal life is personal.

381
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,930
Let's talk about your personal life with those other than my mother.

382
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,380
Listen,young lady...

383
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:36,900
I don't think I understand what you're talking about.

384
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:39,360
So,if you'll excuse me.

385
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,950
So yesterday when you said you were at work...

386
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,570
do you always do your consults down by the beach?

387
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,080
With a leggy blonde?

388
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,490
One you used to be married to?

389
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,970
I don't know what you think you saw,

390
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,240
but adult relationships can be very complex.

391
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,110
I know.

392
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:01,070
And that's why I was going to ask my mother to explain.

393
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:05,840
Then I thought with everything that's happened to her,to us,I didn't want to upset her.

394
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:06,790
That's a good instinct.

395
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,870
But then I was going to ask her another question.

396
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,150
About these leather boots I saw down at the plaza.

397
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:16,120
They're really cute,and really expensive.

398
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,830
I'm a seven and a half.

399
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,850
Hey,Brad,Eric.

400
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,290
Hey,Mrs.Cohen.

401
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,120
Man,is she hot.

402
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,760
Smoking.

403
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,360
Hey,sweetheart,how's your mother?

404
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,990
She's recovering from an unfortunate accident with a wall unit.

405
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,430
I told her it was a built-in.

406
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,040
She's in her room if you want to go in.

407
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,520
It's not like she'll know you're there anyway.

408
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:07,640
$1,500 for a pair of boots?

409
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:10,500
Do you know how many pencils I could buy Sudanese school children?

410
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:13,010
Intro to Developing Nations,it's one of my favorite classes.

411
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:15,620
Yeah,I can see that.It's very cool.

412
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:20,310
Followed closely by Environmental Studies.

413
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,070
Gosh,this is a non-renewable resource.

414
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,320
I can't believe this place doesn't have a recycling program.

415
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,250
You should call our local councilman.

416
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,310
Good idea.

417
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,570
I was being sarcastic.

418
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,350
Oh,I don't do sarcasm anymore,I'm post-ironic.

419
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,390
You mean earnest?

420
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:34,500
Hey,I'm not here to help the environment,okay?

421
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,790
I'm here to help Ryan.

422
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,240
Except he doesn't want our help right now,

423
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,390
so why don't I take you home?You can drop off your bag.

424
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,220
No.You know what?

425
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,030
I'm just going to meet my dad for dinner and then come right back here,so...

426
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,560
So you're not even going home?
No.

427
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,050
Yes.Of course.

428
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,980
I just don't know if we'll have time.I mean,we have a lot of work to do.

429
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:54,560
3,000 miles at 30,000 feet,I had a lot of time to think.

430
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,040
Rally up your geek army.

431
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,470
I have a plan.

432
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,810
Julie,it's me.

433
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,250
Kirsten?
Yeah.

434
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,310
Can I come in?

435
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,050
Today's not a good day.

436
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,130
I know.

437
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,590
None of them are,but hiding in your room won't make it better.

438
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,680
Oh,thank God it's you.

439
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,490
I was starting to think you'd forgotten about me.

440
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,600
We can sit outside and talk.

441
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,110
I'll make some tea.

442
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,630
Can I call you back?

443
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,110
Kirsten,it's so thoughtful of you to stop by.

444
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,430
But as you can see,everything's fine.

445
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:39,530
But you said it wasn't a good day.

446
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,110
For visitors,because I'm so very busy.

447
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,400
Thanks for stopping by,Keeks.

448
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,180
Oh,love your top.

449
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,340
Can we have a table for two,please?

450
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,230
My little girl is home.

451
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,800
Dad,I'm going to use the bathroom,then I'll find you.

452
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,110
Okay.

453
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,290
excuse me

454
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,460
excuse me,would you pls hurry up

455
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,380
"To go" means "to go," implying in a hurry.

456
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,390
I mean,how long does it take to club a turkey?

457
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,810
Should I put it on your family's tab?

458
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,940
Considering I have no money other than euros,yes.

459
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,160
Oh,my God.

460
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,800
Summer.

461
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,360
I just talked to you,you were in France.

462
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,410
And you were in Rhode Island.

463
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,070
It's just amazing the way this world works.

464
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:34,400
What are you doing back in Newport?

465
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,820
Are you meeting your mom?

466
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,750
My mom,no.My mom is in Cabo,she won't...

467
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,040
be back for a few days.

468
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,470
Oh,my God,my mom.

469
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,000
xxxxxxxxxx

470
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,960
you never saw me.

471
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,600
Ryan,it's Julie.

472
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,100
It's important.

473
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,150
What's this?

474
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,370
It's why I needed to see you.

475
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:03,280
You see,after it happened,I hired a private investigator to find out where he went.

476
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,900
Volchok.

477
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,890
And now I know.

478
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,480
All the information is in this file.

479
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,740
I'm not giving it to the cops.

480
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,680
Jail's too good for him.

481
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,780
I'm giving it to you.

482
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,840
You're the only person who can understand how I feel.

483
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,940
And you can do with it,with him,what you want.

484
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,860
I don't want it.
What?

485
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:39,200
I don't care about him,I don't care about any of it,and I don't want to start.

486
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,540
That's a-That's a lie,Ryan.

487
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:45,170
That's...

488
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,040
I know you.

489
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:54,040
Even if you didn't come to her funeral or never visit her grave,you still care.

490
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:14,430
You know,I don't usually refer to myself as a genius,but I may have to make an exception.

491
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,940
Leon,how is the ink coming?

492
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,750
Hey!

493
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:24,020
Am I the only one who's working here?

494
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,000
Get off,mouth breather.

495
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:30,310
Summer,if you want to go home and shower,we can take it from here.

496
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,140
No,we can't.I want to go home and shower.

497
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,350
That's okay,I'll just take a little sponge bath in the ladies room.

498
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,010
Really?

499
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:39,720
Because you're normally pretty rigorously about your bathing.

500
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,600
I'm going to go get Ryan.

501
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:45,060
Yeah,okay,great,it's just,um,I mean,you haven't even been home yet.

502
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,440
You don't want to drop off your bag or...

503
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,620
What's the point of going home?

504
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:53,020
If the polar ice caps keep melting at their current rate,all of Newport will be under water in ten years anyway.

505
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:15,700
Summer.

506
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,400
Hey,Atwood.

507
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,170
If you came here to talk...

508
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,410
You're not talking.

509
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,830
I got it.

510
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,110
Great to see you,too.

511
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:31,840
I really like what you've done with your whole face.

512
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,880
So,I'm going to need you to come with me now.

513
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:41,090
Can't do it; got to work.

514
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,060
Right.

515
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:50,260
Running that germy rag across those filthy tables,it's really important stuff.

516
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:54,150
Look,I just flew 3,000 miles...
I didn't ask you to.

517
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:58,820
No,Seth did.

518
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,910
He's worried about you.

519
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,950
So are the Cohens.

520
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,700
I know you think that you're protecting them,but...

521
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,190
you're not,you're just hurting them.

522
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:11,000
Besides,Seth keeps leaving me these endless whiny messages.

523
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,380
They're totally clogging up my voice mail.

524
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,050
Ryan,come on,take a deep breath.

525
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,900
Just let me do what I do best.

526
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,530
Which is what?
Giving orders.

527
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:25,040
Just do what I say,Atwood,one last time.

528
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:51,740
Did I see Kaitlin driving off in the Lexus?

529
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,970
The silent treatment,huh?

530
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:01,840
So I guess Kaitlin has talked to you.

531
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:06,750
Julie,I didn't mean for this to happen.

532
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:09,530
I just needed somebody to talk to,

533
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:14,250
and at first that's all it was,just...talk.

534
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:17,730
But you're not even listening to me,are you?

535
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,690
What?

536
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,700
Nothing.

537
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:37,120
So why are we going to the comic bookstore?

538
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:41,430
Because I said so and you agreed to do what I said,so...

539
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:47,030
As I told Seth,I don't really want to...talk.

540
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:51,150
You don't have to talk.

541
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,330
You don't even have to listen.

542
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,170
All you have to do is read.

543
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,310
Look,Leon,lights.

544
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,660
Wh-Wh-What's this?

545
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,330
You made me a comic book?

546
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,170
This is no ordinary comic book,my friend.

547
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,860
This is an origin story.

548
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:13,670
Now you may never save the planet,but you did save us,so this is our story.

549
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,520
Now,it's true when you showed up,I had a super power,but it was one I didn't want.

550
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:25,330
Being invisible,not as much fun as it sounds.

551
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:29,360
And the ice queen was surrounded by an impenetrable force field.

552
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,880
And her silver cell phone was her only link to the outside world.

553
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:38,020
The litigator strained to hold up the weight of the world so burdened with the problems of others

554
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:41,350
that he couldn't see those of his own family.

555
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:49,190
One day the litigator brought his work home with him.

556
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,610
Only this time,his work looked strangely like a young Russell Crowe.

557
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:56,350
It's okay,Seth,I can read.

558
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,450
Well,here we are.

559
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,860
That's it.

560
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,980
Thanks for taking the time,

561
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,420
letting us make fools of ourselves.

562
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,280
It meant a lot to Seth.

563
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,250
And to Kirsten.

564
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,880
Not so much to me.

565
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,850
I'm no softy.
No,I know.

566
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,410
You should probably get going.

567
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,830
You're late.

568
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:11,800
I hope they don't fire me.
I bet they got great benefits,huh?

569
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,200
Good dental?

570
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,310
The accommodations

571
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,150
Yeah,uh...

572
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:20,760
yeah,actually,about that,I...

573
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,390
If I,you know,ever wanted to,you know,once in a while...

574
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:27,860
The,uh,the pool house is probably filled with boxes,right?

575
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:30,550
It's exactly the way you left it.

576
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,370
A little too empty if you ask me.

577
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:40,150
Well,it wouldn't take me too long to pack.

578
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,120
Kirsten's got some leftovers from last night.

579
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,930
Thanks.

580
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,060
Thank you.

581
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,850
You know,at the risk of saying too much...

582
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:00,440
being there with her when it happened,

583
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,320
you're never going to get over it,

584
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:06,810
but you'll get used to it.

585
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:12,470
Just let yourself feel what you need to feel,even if if hurts.

586
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:16,060
Yeah,one step at a time,okay?
Okay,I'm going to shut up now.

587
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,950
Like,uh,giving these guys some notice,packing my toothbrush.

588
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:22,200
Let me buy you a toothbrush.

589
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,920
You got it.

590
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,210
See you at home.

591
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,350
Well,it seems like Ryan really went for it.

592
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:39,420
Seems like it.
Yeah.

593
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,210
I couldn't have done it without you.

594
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:44,550
Yeah,totally,since it was my idea and I got him to show up.

595
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:47,840
Sure,no,that's what I meant,so...

596
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,240
thank you.

597
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,170
Yeah.

598
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:07,830
Why don't you go home and see if Ryan's there.

599
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:09,920
You know,I really want to know what happened.
Sure,okay.

600
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,520
Another good idea.

601
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,270
I'll call you.
Okay.

602
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:20,490
tomorrow,you want to get breakfast at the diner like old times?

603
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,130
Sure.

604
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,600
Okay.

605
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:31,270
Hey,man.

606
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,220
I heard you were getting out of here.

607
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,580
Can't say I blame you.

608
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:38,870
Guy from last night,he's looking for another round if you're interested.

609
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,380
Hey,Cohen,it's me.

610
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,910
I really hope Ryan was there when you got back,

611
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:51,340
because I won't be.

612
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:56,080
I totally forgot there's this protest against seal poachers and,um,

613
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:58,340
Heather Mills McCartney is going to be there.

614
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:03,550
I just want to see how she's doing,you know,with everything after the divorce and all,so...

615
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:09,010
listen,I'm sorry,but,uh,Thanksgiving is only a few weeks away.

616
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,600
So...

617
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,860
okay...

618
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,530
I love you.

619
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,890
Give a hoot,don't pollute.Bye.

620
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,720
marissa cooper
beloved baughter
sister,friend

621
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,100
I was wondering when you'd finally come here.

622
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,300
Thanks for meeting me.

623
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,990
I'm here every day.

624
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,570
You have it?

625
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:09,850
If you don't mind me asking,what changed your mind?

626
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,660
I just realized...

627
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:48,030
i have to do this
