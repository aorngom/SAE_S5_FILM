00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,075
<i>Previously on</i> The <i>O.C.:</i>

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,196
It's about your father. He's dead.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,912
She's taking it pretty hard, huh?

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,150
Get your hands off me!
Are you happy?

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,312
Your family requested I be here
to help them lead an intervention.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,869
We are worried that
you have an addiction to alcohol.

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,395
I'm so sorry that I put you
through this.

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,120
He attacked her, Seth.
But she didn't tell Ryan because...

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,236
- He has to know.
- I'm gonna settle this with Trey.

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,799
Once and for all.

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,031
Oh, my God. Stop it.
You're killing him.

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,111
I got a gunshot wound.
Exited right clavicle, punctured an artery.

13
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,679
- He still alive?
- Not for long.

14
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,512
<i>How could you, man?</i>

15
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,875
<i>I would've done anything for you.</i>

16
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,871
<i>Look, man, I was messed up.</i>
<i>I was stoned.</i>

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,600
- We still have questions.
- I gotta see if he'll be okay.

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,079
<i>Trey, get off of him, please!</i>

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,468
He's not gonna die, right?

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,790
<i>It wasn 't my idea, Trey.</i>
<i>I didn 't wanna steal that car.</i>

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,520
<i>Yeah, well, I went away for it,</i>
<i>and you got the good life.</i>

22
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,636
<i>So you had to destroy it?</i>
<i>You had to hurt her, huh?</i>

23
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,438
That's my brother.
Is he gonna be okay?

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,113
He'd be better
if someone hadn't shot him.

25
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,396
- Wait, please...
- He's lost a lot of blood.

26
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,390
Jesus, what the hell happened to you?

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,956
- Nothing, I'm fine.
- Can someone look at him?

28
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,078
You can look at him just as soon
as we're done talking to him.

29
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,159
Ryan.

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,269
- Did you discharge this weapon?
- Yes, I already...

31
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,716
- Don't answer him! Don't say anything!
- You okay?

32
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,039
We're losing him.

33
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,829
You all right?

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,035
Ryan?

35
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,358
Seth? You okay?

36
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,678
Hey, man. Just wanted you
to know that...

37
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,159
You okay?

38
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,072
- I just had the worst nightmare.
- Yeah? I've got some bad news.

39
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,152
It wasn't a dream.
Yeah, yeah, I know.

40
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,875
Well, that lawyer guy's
on his way over, so...

41
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,155
Yeah.

42
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,309
You know, Coop...

43
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,711
...if you'd have asked what we'd be
doing the weekend before senior year...

44
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,553
...I probably would have said
a road trip to Rosarito...

45
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,314
...or rush week at SC
meeting college boys.

46
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,436
And waiting to get
charged with manslaughter?

47
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,791
Wouldn't have made the list.

48
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,992
You're gonna get through this, Coop.

49
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,469
You're innocent,
you were saving Ryan's life.

50
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,914
Try explaining that to Ryan.

51
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,748
He understands why you did it.
He's not mad.

52
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,469
It's just like this weird,
horrible thing hanging over us.

53
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,590
Like the elephant in the room.
Or in the Intensive Care Unit.

54
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,318
Before Trey, I never actually knew
anyone in a coma.

55
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,278
Well, I mean, on <i>The Valley</i> there's
someone in a coma every week.

56
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,829
But I think they do that
so when the person wakes up...

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,513
...another actor can play the part.

58
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,638
Unfortunately, if Trey wakes up,
he's still gonna be Trey.

59
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,837
If he wakes up.

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,116
You gotta admit, Coop,
whatever happens...

61
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,430
...Ryan facing off with Trey
to avenge your honor?

62
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,239
God, that is so freaking hot.

63
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,357
In a mythic, biblical,
samurai, Western kind of way.

64
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,795
I really wish that helped me
sleep at night, Summer.

65
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,714
- You're still not sleeping?
- I shot someone, Sum.

66
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,474
And even if he lives,
which is a big if...

67
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,552
...I'm still gonna have to live
with that for the rest of my life.

68
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,633
Oh, senior year.

69
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,918
Should be all-time.

70
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,035
Yeah.

71
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,753
Thanks a bunch, Sandy.

72
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,998
If a pot and a half isn't enough
to get you through the morning...

73
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,149
...I can make more.

74
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,799
That'd be great.

75
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,550
Sorry for the mess,
it's been a little hectic.

76
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,756
- Seth will be right down.
- And Mr. Atwood?

77
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,909
He's getting dressed.

78
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,753
The kids have been through a lot
with this hanging over them.

79
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,114
Now school is starting.

80
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,918
Which is why the DA
wants to get moving.

81
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,719
We waited as long as we could
for Mr. Atwood to wake up...

82
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,350
...but we're getting calls from parents.
The DA's under pressure to prosecute.

83
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,112
Except there's nothing to prosecute.

84
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,350
Marissa's protected under
the defense of others.

85
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,636
Of course, your boss
may not find that very sexy.

86
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,031
Or true. DA's not looking
to go after Marissa.

87
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,518
Ryan's innocent.

88
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,636
You got his statement
at the scene and hers.

89
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,189
Look at the record Ryan's got.
His history of violence.

90
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,158
Caleb Nichol's daughter is the one
shooting ex-cons with a.45?

91
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,153
- She saved Ryan's life.
- Why was he at Trey's in the first place?

92
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,151
His brother tried to rape his girlfriend.

93
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,153
- We've got cause.
- Yeah, and you got witnesses.

94
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,392
The only people who saw the gun
go off were Mr. Atwood, Miss Cooper...

95
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,313
...and the other Mr. Atwood.
Who may or may not wake up.

96
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,672
If you go after Ryan,
even if he's brought in on charges...

97
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,910
...Social Services
could take him away from us.

98
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,674
Which explains Miss Cooper's
motivation to cover for him.

99
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,876
Mr. Atwood's got a lot more to lose.

100
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,189
Where is your wife anyway?

101
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,831
She's out of town.

102
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,115
My name is Kirsten,
and I'm an alcoholic.

103
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,633
Hi, Kirsten.

104
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,475
Kirsten, your progress here at Suriak
has been truly wonderful to watch.

105
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,870
You're a model patient
for everyone here.

106
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,519
Well, I don't know about that.

107
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,389
I mean, Shelly is definitely better
at poker. She's cleaned me out.

108
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,955
But being here...

109
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,238
...has given me the clarity to understand
why I turned to alcohol in the first place.

110
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,234
And do you feel comfortable
sharing with the group why that was?

111
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,639
Sure. I mean,
we're all in this together.

112
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,392
I...

113
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,909
I guess it begins and ends
with my dad.

114
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,152
He was...

115
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,591
...an amazing man.

116
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,193
But controlling.

117
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,273
And I realized that
I was living his life, not mine.

118
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,994
After my mother died,
I did everything I could to please him.

119
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,435
But I realize that no matter how hard
I worked, or how hard I tried...

120
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,033
It was never enough.

121
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,159
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,155
No. No, it's true. It was never enough.
Became my mantra.

123
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,793
I was never a good enough wife
or a mom...

124
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,871
...because I wasn't
a good enough daughter.

125
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,715
The power that comes
with that kind of difficult realization...

126
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,192
...will be invaluable after you leave us.
- Are you trying to get rid of me?

127
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,909
Well, it sounds to me
like Suriak's work is done.

128
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,552
You'll need to get a sponsor,
attend meetings...

129
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,600
...but there's no reason
you can't do that from your home.

130
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,519
Great.

131
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,271
Mr. Atwood,
do you swear to tell the truth...

132
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,033
...and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

133
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,189
I do.

134
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,273
Well, then you won't mind
if I record this deposition.

135
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,034
Sure. Release it on iTunes.
I hope it's a really big hit.

136
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,349
Just answer the questions.

137
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,351
I've already answered
all these questions.

138
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,312
I have nothing new to say.

139
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,869
Well, your previous statement
came at the hospital.

140
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,838
It was traumatic. Maybe you
remember things differently now.

141
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,877
I remember everything exactly
as I told you.

142
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,712
Well, then you can tell me again.

143
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,879
I confronted Trey
about what had happened...

144
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,315
...and that's when
he pulled the gun on me.

145
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,711
And we called Marissa
to see if maybe she could stop Ryan.

146
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,917
And that's when Marissa saved
my life.

147
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,548
You mean,
that's when Marissa shot Trey?

148
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,831
And you witnessed the shooting?

149
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,150
It was clear when we got there
what had happened.

150
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,312
- Just answer the question.
- No, I did not. I did...

151
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,349
- And I didn't shoot him.
- Your prints were on the gun.

152
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,751
Because I put the safety back on
to make sure it didn't go off again. We...

153
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,477
- We weren't exactly thinking at the time.
- Just one final question.

154
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,077
What were you afraid was going to
happen between Ryan and his brother?

155
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,515
Why were you trying to stop him?

156
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,039
You went to Trey's that night to kill
your brother, didn't you, Mr. Atwood?

157
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,475
So, what kind of food
do you think prosecutors like?

158
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,279
Because that's what's important here,
Jimmy? Okay.

159
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,796
So does this look like the outfit the
mother of an innocent girl would wear?

160
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,992
Yeah, well, at least somebody
has their priorities in order.

161
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,229
I just hope Marissa listens to me
and our attorney.

162
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,960
The last thing we need is her admitting
she shot someone.

163
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,190
Jules, she already admitted it.

164
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,318
She wasn't in her right frame of mind
when she spoke to the police.

165
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,995
- It's not like she's a trained assassin.
- So... So, what's our story?

166
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,948
- Trey shot himself in the back?
- No, Jimmy, be reasonable.

167
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,953
She's not gonna say Ryan did it.
They already have her statement.

168
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,634
Nobody believes her.
They all think she's protecting him.

169
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,830
So you want Ryan to go away for this?

170
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,670
All I know is that
before he moved to Newport...

171
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,149
...our lives were a lot more normal.
Stable.

172
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,232
So it's his fault that I went bankrupt
and nearly went to jail...

173
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,392
...and you married Caleb Nichol
only to watch him drown in a pool...

174
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,030
...and Trey got shot?
- Not everything I say is meant literally.

175
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,749
I'm venting. Look, I wish
none of this ever happened, but it did.

176
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,720
And we have a chance
to be a family again.

177
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,030
I don't wanna lose that.

178
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,389
Look, l...

179
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,269
Put out some crudités and the Gouda.
I'll go see if Marissa's out of the shower.

180
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,632
Hey, you decent?

181
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,153
Thought maybe
you could use a post-depo dip.

182
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,799
I just showered.

183
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,428
A fair point. We'll stay away
from aquatic activities.

184
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,830
- Something landlocked maybe.
- I'm gonna visit Trey.

185
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,356
I was gonna go with a movie, this being
the time when Hollywood dumps...

186
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,080
...their crappy would-be blockbusters
which we could mock...

187
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,958
...and thus
feel better about ourselves.

188
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,712
- You got the keys?
- But...

189
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,836
...visiting your comatose brother
in the ICU?

190
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,629
That's also an excellent way
to relax and blow off steam, so I'll drive.

191
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,392
Awesome.

192
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,230
Oh, Mr. Caldwell, would you like
some more lemonade? Mr. Esbenshade?

193
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,719
<i>No, thanks.</i>

194
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,639
Come on, it's okay for
a prosecutor and defense attorney...

195
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,917
...to have a glass of lemonade together.
We're all human beings here.

196
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,310
I'm not so sure about these guys.

197
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,916
Miss Cooper. I'm
Deputy District Attorney Chris Caldwell.

198
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,389
- I'll be conducting this deposition.
- Hi.

199
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,393
- Where do you want us to sit?
- Miss Roberts can't be present.

200
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,790
We wouldn't want you
influencing her testimony.

201
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,349
She knows what you know,
which is the truth.

202
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,272
Which is what I already told
you people.

203
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,590
Miss Roberts,
if you could please wait inside.

204
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,352
Summer, we have HBO On Demand.

205
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,193
Every season of <i>Sex and the City.</i>
Knock yourself out.

206
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,155
Mariss, you'll be okay.
I'm just gonna wait inside.

207
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,869
I already told everybody everything.
I don't wanna go through this again.

208
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,951
Talk about it
in front of these strangers.

209
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,157
Marissa, I need to remind you,
this deposition is binding.

210
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,880
Your court testimony can't waiver
from what is said here.

211
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,951
I told the truth,
so, what's the problem?

212
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,113
The problem, Ms. Cooper,
is that your testimony lacks credibility.

213
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,429
Miss Roberts, please wait inside.

214
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,311
Come on, Summer.

215
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,552
Now, Miss Cooper,
I'm going to have to swear you in.

216
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,235
It'll be okay, Marissa.

217
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,112
I kind of like him this way.
He's a better listener.

218
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,034
Sorry.
I get talkative around coma patients.

219
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,476
It's a compensation thing.
I'll give you guys a minute.

220
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,471
Wait, just...

221
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,472
Sorry, man, I don't even know
why I came here.

222
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,200
I wanted to kill him.
Now I'd do anything to take it back.

223
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,828
You can't blame yourself.
You can't change what happened.

224
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,275
Yeah, but Trey could have tried
to make it work.

225
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,159
Living in town, I mean,
I could have my brother here.

226
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,198
Now everything's screwed up
and he's the only family I got left.

227
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,591
Well, that's not exactly true.

228
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,073
Okay, I just have to say that
I still support the recent decision...

229
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,754
...in the wake of all the violence
we've experienced...

230
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,117
...to ban any games with ninjas or guns.
- Yeah, but?

231
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,796
Well, it's just, I don't understand
any of the rules to this...

232
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,951
..."baseball," they call it.

233
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,872
You mean, America's pastime?

234
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,670
Yeah, feels like more of a fad to me,
buddy. I don't really see it catching on.

235
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,308
Sure. You called
Marissa and Summer, right?

236
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,029
They're with the Dark Lord Sauron
or whatever the DA's name is.

237
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,031
Did that guy blink
during your deposition?

238
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,192
I feel like he didn't even have eyelids.

239
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,479
Hello.

240
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,594
Oh, I'm sorry, he's not in right now.
Can I take a message?

241
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,513
<i>Dallas McPherson will stand in...</i>

242
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,557
Okay, thank you.

243
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,632
That was the hospital. Trey woke up.

244
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,073
Kirsten, right?

245
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,391
Hi, I'm Charlotte Morgan. I'm so sorry
about interrupting you in group.

246
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,709
Oh, no, no, that's okay.

247
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,038
When I heard you talking,
it was like you were describing my life.

248
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,350
The rich, dominating father,
the high pressure...

249
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,192
...nothing was ever good enough.

250
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,874
- I'm just glad I didn't bore you.
- No, it was amazing.

251
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,112
I mean, to hear someone on the same
journey as me. Well, obviously...

252
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,397
...you're a little further along.
I could never have admitted all that.

253
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,394
- You're so brave and honest.
- I don't know about that, but thank you.

254
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,398
Do you wanna maybe
get coffee sometime?

255
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,152
We can talk trash
about our dads.

256
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,152
Sure, I'd love to.

257
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,469
Okay.

258
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,874
That's my husband.

259
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,120
Well, I don't wanna take up
any more of your time. Goodbye.

260
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,793
Bye.

261
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,591
Look at you.

262
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,395
So it exploded all over the kitchen?

263
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,949
- The microwave, mostly.
- An entire jar of peanut butter?

264
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,395
Well, we were trying to make
peanut-butter cookies...

265
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,879
...as a surprise for you.

266
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,872
It seemed like a good idea
at the time.

267
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,589
Well, it's a well-known science factoid
that metal plus heat equals...

268
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,069
Peanut butter everywhere.

269
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,710
These are just a few of the lessons we
three struggling, handsome bachelors...

270
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,029
...are learning every week.

271
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,111
Sounds like you have
a reality series here.

272
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,430
Oh, I hope it's not a reality
for too long.

273
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,913
So... Well, you should be
coming home any day now, right?

274
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,190
Just give me a heads up,
so I can make sure the house is livable.

275
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,148
Yeah, l... I just have to sit down with Dr.
Woodruff soon and see what's going on.

276
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,309
See if I'm eligible.

277
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,913
Hey, Seth. I'm here with Mom.

278
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,711
Well, thanks for calling.

279
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,315
I'll see you when I get back
at the house.

280
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,512
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

281
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,877
He says hi, that he misses you.

282
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,631
I better get going. Go back to work.

283
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,712
Just let me know
what the doctor says.

284
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,791
- Yeah.
- All right.

285
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,592
Hey. So, what's going on?

286
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,237
- Trey's awake.
- Oh, my God.

287
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,235
- When did he...?
- Not too long. I just saw him.

288
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,992
- You saw him?
- Yeah.

289
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,390
I've been up there a couple times,
you know.

290
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,879
I didn't know.

291
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,678
- Hey, I would've gone with you.
- No.

292
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,549
You shouldn't have to see him
ever again. I don't have the same choice.

293
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,637
Well, I mean,
I guess now that he's awake...

294
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,870
...he can tell the lawyers
what really happened.

295
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,508
Trey got us into this mess,
hopefully he can get us out.

296
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,353
Yeah, our future's in Trey's hands.

297
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,360
Come on, Seth and Summer
are at the diner.

298
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,438
What do you mean,
it'll take two months?

299
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,909
Caleb wrote a will,
just read it already.

300
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,719
It's much more difficult than that,
Mrs. Cooper-Nichol.

301
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,189
As you can see,
there's a lot of paperwork...

302
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,874
...a number of offshore accounts
we haven't yet found.

303
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,679
Okay. Well, you just take
your sweet time, Mr. Frankel.

304
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,037
But understand this: We are paying a
very high-priced defense attorney...

305
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,839
...to protect our daughter
and right now the meter's running.

306
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,115
I wish I could help.

307
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,389
I'm a grieving widow.

308
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,992
- Clearly.
- You've seen the will, haven't you, Jeff?

309
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,073
Why don't you just tell us what's in it
and it'll be our little secret.

310
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,038
- I can't do that.
- It's our attorney, Julie.

311
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,599
Let's play Hot-Cold.

312
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,509
Two million.

313
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,436
Seven million. I have at least
3 million coming from my prenup.

314
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,717
- You blinked. Does one blink mean yes?
- Julie, the hospital called.

315
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,152
What? What did they say?

316
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,950
- Okay. I have an idea.
- Are you gonna save Chrismukkah again?

317
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,951
Because I really enjoyed that last time.

318
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,830
- We need to have some fun.
- Fun?

319
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,276
Yeah. Look, we can't control the future,
right? So how do we deal?

320
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,034
We could do what my stepmother
does and take painkillers...

321
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,432
...to numb ourselves from the reality that
life is random, unfair and meaningless...

322
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,353
- There's another option, right?
...or we can accept the fact...

323
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,795
...that we can't worry about
what we can't control...

324
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,678
...and just enjoy
the time we have.

325
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,269
Trey's awake,
and school is starting soon.

326
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,510
Who knows what's to come, right?

327
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,429
So this might be our last chance
to have fun.

328
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,153
I like plan B.

329
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,069
So, what do we do?

330
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,157
Well, I have an idea.

331
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,833
But I'd have to ask my dad first.

332
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,953
Mr. Cooper's got a nice boat, huh?

333
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,270
Yeah. It's amazing
what laundered money can buy.

334
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,869
You know, Cohen,
with your two hands on the wheel...

335
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,271
...and the wind blowing through your
hair, you actually look kind of hot.

336
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,398
Let me guess, Summer,
you have a weakness for seamen.

337
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,309
- Cohen.
- Yeah?

338
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,311
And then there's that.

339
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,598
Hey.

340
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,518
Hey.

341
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,875
- How you doing? You okay?
- Yeah, I guess.

342
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,594
I mean... I don't know,
to be honest. Are we okay?

343
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,872
Yeah, sure.

344
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,513
Why wouldn't we be?

345
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,713
Because since that night,
we haven't really talked about it.

346
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,675
Hey, knock it off. Listen, you gotta
get your mind off everything.

347
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,875
Who wants to go fishing?

348
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,951
You do the hunting,
we'll do the gathering.

349
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,157
Fishing, I like that idea,
but we don't have any bait.

350
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,395
Wait, no, we have Summer.
This little sardine.

351
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,993
- No.
- You guys, that's not funny.

352
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,196
- Look at this little sardine.
- No. No. No!

353
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,678
No, guys, come on.

354
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,115
Well, if this is as good
as it gets for a while...

355
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,554
Yeah, that was pretty good.

356
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,190
Yeah. Thanks for almost getting
my bathing suit wet, Cohen.

357
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,713
My pleasure.

358
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,350
Cohen. I can't believe
that you did that, Cohen.

359
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,435
I'm looking for Trey Atwood.

360
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,759
I'm sorry. Visiting hours
ended a while ago.

361
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,117
Oh, did I forget to introduce myself?
I'm Julie Cooper-Nichol.

362
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,431
As in the Nichol Wing of this hospital
which we're both standing in.

363
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,954
Oh, hello, Mrs. Cooper-Nichol.

364
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,149
My husband was very philanthropic.
Hospitals were his favorite charity.

365
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,548
Especially making sure...

366
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,757
...nurses and orderlies were
compensated for their hard work.

367
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,629
I would hate to see his passion
fall by the wayside.

368
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,232
Hello, Trey.

369
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,311
I've been wanting to talk to you.

370
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,953
Oh, no, no. No pleasantries.

371
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,633
Look at you, lying there all helpless...

372
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,558
...unable to stop me from doing
whatever I wanna do.

373
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,399
Kind of like the night
you tried to rape my daughter.

374
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,399
I'm sorry.

375
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,915
Oh, you should be, you son of a bitch.

376
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,708
Which is why you're gonna help me.

377
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,719
In exchange,
I'm prepared to compensate you.

378
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,916
How does $20,000 sound?

379
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,149
- What do you want?
- Three simple words.

380
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,515
Repeat after me, Trey:

381
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,430
"Ryan shot me."

382
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,869
Trey?

383
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,077
Ryan...

384
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,431
...shot me.

385
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,475
Okay, so I know <i>Teen Wolf</i>
is not a realistic movie.

386
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,915
Really going out on a limb there.
But, yeah?

387
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,069
Well...

388
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,676
I mean, how does being a werewolf
make you a better basketball player?

389
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,114
Can't argue that one.

390
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,675
Hey, fellas,
you mind shutting off the TV?

391
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,557
Trey talked to the police this morning.
He confirmed their suspicion...

392
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,995
...that it was you who shot him.

393
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,388
Well, that's a total lie.

394
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,596
Now, the DA's office gave me
a heads up.

395
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,672
They're gonna be issuing a warrant
for your arrest in a few hours.

396
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,478
We're gonna figure this thing out.

397
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,871
But I need to know that you are
telling me everything that happened.

398
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,630
What difference does it make?

399
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,799
You're gonna fix this, right?

400
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,311
A little early for champagne,
don't you think?

401
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,710
I'm making mimosas.
They're breakfast-appropriate.

402
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,394
Besides, we should celebrate.

403
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,077
Celebrate the fact that Marissa's
boyfriend is getting arrested?

404
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,958
No, the fact that Marissa isn't.

405
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,557
You know, Julie,
it's just a little too convenient.

406
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,188
Trey wakes up and immediately
points the finger at Ryan?

407
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,113
Well, sometimes, Jimmy,
and I know you don't have...

408
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,750
...that much experience with this,
but things work out.

409
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,197
You know,
even if Marissa was accused...

410
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,875
...she wouldn't go to jail.
- She also wouldn't be going to college.

411
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,838
Forget what the law says about
just cause and defense of others.

412
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,150
How's it gonna look
on her college application:

413
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,392
- "Shoots blue-collar thugs."
- I don't want Marissa to suffer either...

414
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,755
...but Ryan...
- Ryan's die was cast...

415
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,070
...Iong before he moved
into the Cohen pool house.

416
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,470
Look, Jimmy,
let's just put this to bed.

417
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,553
We'll collect on Caleb's will, and we'll
go back to being a normal, happy family.

418
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,312
Hey, what's for breakfast?

419
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,040
- Hey, kiddo. What are you doing up?
- I can't sleep.

420
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,872
Well, I have news
that's very good for us.

421
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,316
It's just not so good for Ryan.

422
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,156
Well, I know he wants to be left alone.

423
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,070
We have to do something. Should we
bring him a snack? What does Ryan eat?

424
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,356
Dry cereal from a box
and black coffee.

425
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,556
Well, maybe we could
get him something, a gift.

426
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,756
- Sure. Money's no object.
- Okay.

427
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,797
What does Ryan like?

428
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,478
Any favorite movies? Hobbies?

429
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,478
- Cohen, he's your best friend.
- You've known him as long as me.

430
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,108
I don't hear you throwing out
any gems.

431
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,269
Well, we can't just leave him alone
in there.

432
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,318
I know. But who even knows
what to say to him?

433
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,152
He's never been arrested before...

434
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,518
...for attempted murder.

435
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,472
- Where is he?
- He's not really seeing visitors right now.

436
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,915
We're kind of giving him his space.

437
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,436
- This should go well.
- Right behind you, Coop.

438
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,956
- Hey.
- Hey.

439
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:54,671
Hoodie, wifebeater, leather jacket.
It's the Ryan Atwood escapist ensemble.

440
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,559
That's right. No matter what I say,
no one's gonna believe me.

441
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,280
- Dude, you're not running away.
- Yeah. Yeah, I am.

442
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,510
No. No, you're not.

443
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,072
You're sailing.
And we're coming with you.

444
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,949
Yes. Since apparently there's boats
involved, which is my forte.

445
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,190
Totally. We all go down together.

446
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,992
Thanks.

447
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,278
How was your visit? Is your husband
excited you're coming home?

448
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,475
Yes, he is.

449
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,596
Didn't tell him
you're not ready yet, huh?

450
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,871
- Been there.
- Well...

451
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,873
...if Dr. Woodruff says I'm ready,
I must be ready.

452
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,476
Except he won't be there at 3 a.m. when
you're rooting around the spice rack...

453
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,632
...for anything with alcohol
and start pounding vanilla extract.

454
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,195
Oh, God. I'm... I'm sorry.

455
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,319
Is that what happened to you?

456
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,271
It was cough syrup.

457
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,473
That's my biggest fear,
that I'm not ready.

458
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,552
And I'm not going back to my husband
and my boys until I know...

459
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,676
...that I'll never let them down again.

460
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,836
Look, can I give you some advice?

461
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,390
It's not a race.
Take all the time you need.

462
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,108
Hello.

463
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,391
I'm back.

464
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,990
- We're looking for Ryan Atwood.
- You're a little late, I'm afraid.

465
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,513
Nope, she's not here either. And she
left for your house hours ago, Sandy.

466
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,750
You don't think they'd try anything,
do you?

467
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,797
- What's going on?
- The cops are at Sandy's.

468
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,155
The kids are gone.
We don't know where they went.

469
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,392
You don't think
your dad'll miss the boat?

470
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,074
Well, he of all people will understand.

471
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,673
- But we gotta hurry.
- Let's go.

472
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,354
- Hey, man, how long is it to Catalina?
- About four hours.

473
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,193
Then from there we can go
wherever you want. Mexico, Hawaii.

474
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,749
Look, guys, you can get in
a lot of trouble for this...

475
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,194
...so if you wanna back out...

476
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,078
This is a great excuse to skip school.

477
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,552
It's not forever. It's just until we can
get Trey to change his story.

478
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,154
- I understand that, but...
- Yeah.

479
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,152
Glad to see the jump suit still fits.

480
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,908
Well, kid, for someone who's innocent,
you've done a hell of a job to look guilty.

481
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,196
Glad to see you're here
to make me feel better.

482
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,750
No, I'm here to tell you the truth.
As your lawyer and your guardian.

483
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,718
The only person who runs is
somebody who's got something to hide.

484
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,029
Or who has no choice.

485
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,474
I see how these cops and lawyers
look at me.

486
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,952
My record, my family.

487
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,072
And you know I'm right.

488
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,318
This isn't over.

489
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,119
The arraignment's set for tomorrow.
We're gonna fight this.

490
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,999
- Trey could still change his mind.
- Yeah.

491
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,071
How's that gonna happen?

492
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,634
I haven't worn this candy-striper's outfit
since, like, the 10th grade.

493
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,234
Maybe we should volunteer again.
It's good for charity.

494
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,154
Not that I'm against you guys wearing
these uniforms, because I'm not...

495
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,233
...but doesn't this plan seem lighthearted
given the nature of the predicament?

496
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,153
You're not part of the plan.
We're just letting you push a cart.

497
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,072
Okay, Sum, you're on.

498
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,028
- Hey, Denise. How are you?
- Summer Roberts.

499
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,555
I haven't seen you in years.
Where you been?

500
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,756
Oh, I love helping sick people.

501
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,390
It's just, they kept making me sick.
So I've been reassigned...

502
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,438
...to gunshot victims
because you can't catch one of those.

503
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,718
Well, glad to have you back.
Who do you wanna see?

504
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,151
I don't wanna speak
to anyone else.

505
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,675
Hey, did you hear what l...?

506
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,590
Did you come to finish the job?

507
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,390
So you do remember it was me
who shot you.

508
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,838
I...

509
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,870
I'm trying to protect you.

510
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,157
Protect me? By blaming Ryan?

511
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,835
I'm...

512
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,560
I'm sorry, Marissa.

513
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,558
For...

514
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,631
For everything.

515
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,032
I...

516
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,919
I just didn't know
how to make it right.

517
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,468
And she offered me a way out.

518
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,872
What? Who did?

519
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,359
Your mom.

520
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,518
Look...

521
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,672
...Trey...

522
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,597
...if you wanna make it right,
there's only one thing for you to do.

523
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,039
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Hey.

524
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,033
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Sure. Sorry to hear about Ryan.

525
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,476
- You think things couldn't get worse.
- That's why I wanted to talk to you.

526
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,110
I've been trying to figure out
why Trey would try to frame Ryan.

527
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,515
You know, I know the kid's not
gonna be sainted any time soon...

528
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,033
...but still.

529
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,630
The only thing I can figure?

530
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,392
Somebody paid him.

531
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,314
But who would sink that low?

532
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,554
Only one name came to mind.

533
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,033
And you didn't try to stop her.

534
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,590
Look, l... I found out about it too late,
there was nothing I could do.

535
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,910
Jimmy, at some point
you gotta do the right thing.

536
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:41,392
Well, you gotta understand what I'm
dealing with. Put yourself in my shoes.

537
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,552
In your shoes? I got a wife in rehab
who doesn't wanna come home...

538
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,870
...and a kid locked up
for something he didn't do.

539
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,917
I think your shoes are looking
pretty good.

540
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,877
Look, l... I get it, I get it.

541
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,678
I'm trying to protect my family too.

542
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,479
Right. Because family means so much
to you.

543
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,632
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What are you doing back in Newport?

544
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,234
Caleb dies... suddenly you show up.

545
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,435
Grand Central Station. Hello?

546
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,229
Okay.

547
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,552
Thank you.

548
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,591
Wait till Julie hears this.

549
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,471
Hi, sweetie.

550
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,677
I'm still learning how to do the wash,
so whatever no longer fits...

551
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,717
...we'll just send it to your sister.

552
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,836
I know what you did.

553
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,593
What do you mean?

554
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,873
- What's this?
- A copy of Trey's confession.

555
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,191
Saying that if I didn't shoot him,
he would have killed his brother.

556
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,952
The police have one too.

557
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,112
Do you know what you've done?

558
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,355
I'm not going to jail.

559
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,317
But where are you gonna go,
Marissa, huh?

560
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,675
You know how small this town is.
This will get out.

561
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,759
- What? That I saved my boyfriend's life?
- That you shot someone.

562
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,348
When there's a scandal,
no one cares about the details.

563
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,313
All you care about is what people
in Newport think of us. Of you.

564
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,953
You know, I don't need you to protect
me. I need you to stay out of my life.

565
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,755
- What happened?
- You have a hell of a girlfriend.

566
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,872
And if you two get married,
you'll have a hell of a mother-in-law.

567
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,559
But you're free.

568
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,991
There's something I gotta do.

569
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,317
Thanks.

570
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,040
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

571
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,592
Yeah.

572
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,159
This one time, when we were kids...

573
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,949
...Trey got in this big fight
with my mom...

574
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,430
...and her boyfriend of the day...

575
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,912
...and he ran away.
And I stayed up all night...

576
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,116
...waiting for him...

577
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,670
...wondering where he went.

578
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,033
It was always me and Trey
against the world.

579
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,915
How would I make it without him?

580
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,348
And now here I am again...

581
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,152
...alone...

582
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,718
...wondering where he went.
- Hey, look, you're not alone this time.

583
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,155
I know, I know.

584
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,352
- I really wanna put this behind us.
- So do I. But...

585
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,795
I mean, can we?

586
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,875
I hope so.

587
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,833
Okay.

588
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,268
Okay.

589
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,632
