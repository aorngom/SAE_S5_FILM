1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,388
<i>Previously on</i> The <i>O.C.:</i>

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,354
I cannot believe this.

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,592
The cops wanna talk to me about
a letter I wrote Johnny the night he died.

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,718
- Johnny and I used to be friends.
- Yeah, well, what happened?

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,559
No, thanks.

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,836
- This is hard.
- You don't have to say it.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,389
- It's just...
- Not working.

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,198
You ever play strip poker?

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,917
Baby, you did it again.

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,799
- Another amazing meal.
- Oh, my pleasure.

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,595
Ryan, I forgot to ask.
Do you have any requests...

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,354
...for your birthday on Sunday?
- Sunday's your birthday?

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,272
- Thanks, buddy.
- Not just any birthday.

14
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,159
Ryan's turning 18. Becoming
a fully enfranchised citizen...

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,039
...of this great democratic experiment
we call America.

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,794
We know you went to law school.
The important thing is...

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,350
...we need to have a party.
- Oh, no, no, no. No party.

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,717
- You're turning 18. It's huge.
- It's just another year.

19
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,233
Oh, I disagree.

20
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,472
When I turned 18, I couldn't wait
to vote in my first election.

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,914
My little Eagle Scout.

22
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,072
Yeah, and if you cross Johnny Law,
no more of that daycare juvie.

23
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,515
It's gonna be hard time
in the big house for you.

24
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,353
- Reason to celebrate.
- What do you have against parties?

25
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,478
Nothing. Last birthday party I had,
I was nine years old.

26
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,358
My mom took me
to the San Diego Zoo.

27
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,909
Awesome. Since then
you're too cool for parties?

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,117
Then she started having her all-day
drinking-on-the-couch parties.

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,599
You wanna tag in here?

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,273
Look, this is one of life's milestones.
It'd be a mistake to blow past it.

31
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,959
Doesn't have to be a big to-do.

32
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,596
Doesn't have to be a big to-do.

33
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,915
All right. All right, fine.
As long as it's small.

34
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,117
It would have to be. You only know
like us, and Summer, and...

35
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,952
Marissa and I are broken up.

36
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,115
- I'm gonna do some homework.
- Okay.

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,758
I was totally gonna say Marissa.

38
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,789
- Marissa. Wait up.
- Hey.

39
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,713
- Hey. How you doing?
- Fine.

40
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,393
I called you last night.

41
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,394
Oh, yeah. I was out, sorry.
I went for a walk to do some thinking.

42
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,596
Thinking. About anything in particular?

43
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,115
Summer, don't ask
if I'm getting back with Ryan.

44
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,350
I'm just worried.
You haven't been sleeping.

45
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,751
You've eaten, like, four peanuts
and a banana in the past three days.

46
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,230
You spend all your time on that stand
staring out like a Naval widow.

47
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,630
We should get back together
to have a good sleep?

48
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,597
Or you can move on.
Just do something.

49
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,435
Just so you know,
I did sleep better last night.

50
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,511
This morning I had pancakes
for breakfast.

51
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,557
- Seriously?
- Would I lie about pancakes?

52
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,030
No. There's something that I've
been meaning to talk to you about.

53
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,714
I was waiting for you
to be a little less patient zero.

54
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,199
It's kind of about your mom.

55
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,914
Marissa?

56
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,958
Hey, can we just talk about this later?
All right? Call me.

57
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,634
Unbelievable!

58
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,077
Thinking of joining
the Lesbian Alliance?

59
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,958
- No.
- She's gone.

60
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,159
When are you gonna talk?
You can't keep avoiding each other.

61
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,639
I gotta get to class.

62
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,799
Okay, I'm off.

63
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,554
Sandy, there was an idea
that I wanted to run by you.

64
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,994
Shoot.

65
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,432
It's just, Ryan's birthday is a big deal.

66
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,955
And I feel that one of his family
should be here.

67
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,712
His actual family.

68
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,270
Since his father is a guest of the state
and Trey's a <i>persona non grata...</i>

69
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,000
...for the next two centuries...
- That leaves his mom.

70
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,277
Now, I know the last time Dawn
was here it was a little bumpy.

71
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,352
You mean when she got drunk
and knocked the craps table over?

72
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,671
I'm not condemning her,
but I wouldn't want to embarrass Ryan.

73
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,434
Neither do I. I think having her
would mean a lot to him.

74
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,477
If we kept an eye out at the party...

75
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,029
Well, there's also the little matter
of finding her.

76
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,997
She's been missing for over a year.

77
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,754
But I imagine a person
who's worked in a P.D.'s office...

78
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,911
...for 15 years
knows how to find someone.

79
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,389
Don't hold your breath.
I'll make some phone calls.

80
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,836
Just in case, keep it a surprise.
I don't wanna get Ryan's hopes up.

81
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,113
We have a problem.

82
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,954
Yeah. Today's the day
you tell Marissa...

83
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,076
...about your parents doing
the bone dance.

84
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,834
Don't say that again.
I'm talking about Ryan and Marissa.

85
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,752
We've gotten them
back together before.

86
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,036
What thanks did we get?
They broke up again.

87
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,431
They need to make a decision.
Either get back together, or move on.

88
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,275
Right now, they are frozen in that
post-breakup, "What did I do?" moment.

89
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,510
The longer it goes on for,
the worse it is.

90
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,591
- So you need to do something.
- Me?

91
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,320
- Yeah.
- I'm in charge of Ryan's birthday.

92
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,040
Wait, Ryan's birthday is now?
What is he thinking?

93
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,351
He didn't plan it. If you care so much,
why can't you handle this?

94
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,715
I have to worry about
Julie giving my dad VD...

95
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,235
...and taking all of his money.
My plate is full.

96
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,118
Fine.

97
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,714
Dr. R. and Julie Cooper
are doing the bone dance.

98
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,718
- Oh, my God. It's almost 1:30.
- Oh, boy.

99
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,633
My staff's wondering where
I disappear to during lunch.

100
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,917
When else can we see each other
except when the girls are at school?

101
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,991
Did you see what I did
with my cell phone?

102
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,594
I know I put it down when we...
What are we doing?

103
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,593
- I thought we were gonna tell them.
- We were. Then we didn't.

104
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,512
Well, I think it's time.

105
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,433
I totally agree. Okay.
We'll tell them we're dating.

106
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,955
And then when they ask
how serious it is...

107
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,310
Just, it would be good to know.

108
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,479
Yes, of course.

109
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,154
After all, they wanna know
how invested they should be.

110
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,359
- lf they should start making plans.
- Yes. Because it's a big step.

111
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,273
For them.

112
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,958
Okay, Neil. I'm just gonna
come right out and say it.

113
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,114
There you are.

114
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,597
It's my nurse.

115
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,389
I think we should wait a little while
until we can be clear with them.

116
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,113
- That's just what I was gonna say.
- I'm gonna take this.

117
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,232
Yes, Elaine. Is my 1:30 there?

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,797
- Ryan. Hey.
- Hey.

119
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,396
- Come in.
- Yeah, I just thought I'd stop by and...

120
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,915
Okay, wait, wait. Let me just...
Let me just say...

121
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,469
...this is not the stage
at which to make judgments.

122
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,914
Sure. Sure.

123
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,198
Look, I'm gonna make a cute little bar
here you can sit at, with a window.

124
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,351
All right? It's gonna be great.

125
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,034
- When's Gwen get back?
- She decided to stay in Ashland.

126
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,918
She's putting the house
on the market.

127
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,991
- Want some help?
- No, no, no.

128
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,071
- Yes, yes.
- You've done too much already.

129
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,629
It'll be good for me
to be occupied. Believe me.

130
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,435
So how is the whole
Marissa breakup-thing going?

131
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,795
We're broken up.
We don't call each other.

132
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,315
Avoid each other at school.
It's hard.

133
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,948
So maybe you guys should talk.
Just so it's not weird.

134
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,874
Whether we give it another shot,
or decide this is it, either way...

135
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,031
...I need to know how I feel
before we talk.

136
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,112
Otherwise, things have a way
of happening.

137
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,754
So you just have to decide
what you want.

138
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,915
Well, pretty much.

139
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,319
Well, while you're deciding...

140
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,357
...can I recommend
property destruction?

141
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,509
Yes, you can.

142
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,998
Hey!

143
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,797
- Hey, man. You busy?
- Would it matter?

144
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,234
Not really.

145
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,436
Now, in my capacity
as birthday captain...

146
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,194
...I went ahead and reserved
The Bait Shop for Sunday.

147
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,079
- You don't remember me saying small.
- I chose to ignore it.

148
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,038
Wanna see the invitations?
The store made me print a hundred.

149
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,875
I told them you only knew four people,
but it was some kind of policy.

150
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,474
- Give me one for Sadie.
- Sadie, huh? Interesting.

151
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,918
- She's a friend.
- Okay. What do you wanna do with this?

152
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,518
- You're the birthday general.
- I'm the birthday captain.

153
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,434
The decision to invite Marissa or not
is way beyond my pay grade.

154
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,637
I get it. Invite her, it looks like
you're trying to get together.

155
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,075
You don't invite her,
you're saying, " It's over...

156
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,037
...I'm gonna hook up
with random women."

157
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,513
That's a tough call.
So you got till Sunday.

158
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,674
Turning 18's
all about the future, right?

159
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,195
So maybe I do a future theme.

160
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,069
We could have food from the future,
and drinks from the future.

161
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,992
- Sounds great.
- Yeah.

162
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,116
What did Ryan say
about Marissa's invitation?

163
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,158
Nothing. Just got this sort of confused,
wounded look.

164
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,356
How am I not to tell Marissa
about the party?

165
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,193
- I can't keep a secret.
- You managed to not tell her...

166
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,115
...about your dad and her mom
making sweet, beautiful, beautiful love.

167
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,554
Hi.

168
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,838
She's dealing with Ryan stuff now.
She's not ready, okay?

169
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,309
And besides,
I've decided that I'm okay with it.

170
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,516
- You are?
- My dad was whistling this morning.

171
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,956
Julie Cooper makes my dad whistle.
I can't tell him he can't have that.

172
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,148
So as long as they take it
really slow, I'm cool with it.

173
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,591
Door.

174
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,553
Hey, why don't I get it.

175
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,271
Hey. Delivery guy just dropped this off
for your dad.

176
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,438
It's actually addressed to...
Well, okay.

177
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,514
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

178
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,154
"Lovers' cruise to Cabo.
Five days, six nights.

179
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,117
You, the ocean,
and the one you love."

180
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,076
- Got a good buffet.
- I cannot believe this.

181
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,232
- What? He's taking Julie on a cruise?
- He's gonna propose.

182
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,674
What are you talking about?

183
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,956
It's what the man does.
My mom, my stepmonster.

184
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,271
He proposed to both of them
on cruises. This is awful.

185
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,749
You're overreacting.
They just started dating.

186
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,469
My dad only dated my mom a week.
He met my stepmonster on the cruise...

187
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,870
...then proposed with a ring
from the gift shop.

188
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,669
- The man's got a disease.
- Well, after dating Julie Cooper...

189
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,272
Marissa's gonna have to put her
stuff on hold. We gotta stop this.

190
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,673
I do respect a man
who knows how to use power tools.

191
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,752
Yeah. Well, you can thank
my blue-collar DNA.

192
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,595
Actually, before I forget...

193
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,874
Here we go.

194
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,039
- What this?
- So tomorrow's kind of my birthday...

195
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,397
...Seth's throwing a party,
and it's no big deal, but...

196
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,755
Wow, I can hardly process
so much enthusiasm.

197
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,596
But unfortunately,
I don't think I can make it.

198
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,235
I mean, I'd like to. Especially after
you did such a great job selling it.

199
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,868
But a friend of mine's
gonna be in L.A. tomorrow...

200
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,349
...and I promised.
- That's fine. I understand.

201
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,957
It's no big deal.

202
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,072
Hey, you dropped something.

203
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,679
- Marissa?
- Yeah, I've been...

204
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,149
...trying to decide
whether or not to invite her.

205
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,629
- Oh, right. Because if you invite her...
- Yes.

206
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,792
- And if you don't...
- Exactly.

207
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,278
Right.

208
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,714
Seth thinks I'm in some sort
of breakup limbo...

209
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,155
...and I gotta make a choice
one way or the other.

210
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,276
And that's his way
of forcing the issue.

211
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,192
Can't say I disagree.

212
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,432
I was seeing this guy once.
And we loved each other...

213
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,070
...but couldn't seem to make it work.
We also couldn't seem to break up.

214
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,437
- So it just went on and on.
- So how'd it finally end?

215
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,919
Gwen called and she said
Johnny died and I left.

216
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,073
We should probably get to work.

217
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,551
I'm just gonna drill.

218
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,398
Yeah, come in.

219
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,557
- Hey, Sum. What's up?
- Hi. We need to talk.

220
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,473
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

221
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,632
Remember when Ryan first came,
spent the night in the model home?

222
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,190
- The house that he burned down?
- Accidentally, yes.

223
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,355
I've made him a CD
which got lost in the fire.

224
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,431
He said he wished
he had another copy.

225
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,756
So you're making him one
for his birthday?

226
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,151
- That's so romantic.
- No, just thoughtful.

227
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,959
Coop, you're tapping
into core relationship mythology.

228
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,872
- It's romantic.
- Anything I give him...

229
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,873
...will just be read as,
"Hey, let's get back together."

230
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,190
And if I don't
give him anything, it'll be:

231
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,430
"Forget it. I'm over you, moving on."

232
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,073
Well, maybe that's what
you both need right now. You know?

233
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,153
- A clear sign one way or the other.
- Yeah, I just...

234
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,874
I don't wanna make
the wrong decision.

235
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,233
What did you wanna talk about?

236
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,313
Well...

237
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,390
It's just that...

238
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,233
Seth is throwing Ryan
a birthday party tomorrow night...

239
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,436
...at The Bait Shop.
I wanted to invite you.

240
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,956
- Does Ryan know you're inviting me?
- Not exactly.

241
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,113
Summer, you know I can't go
unless Ryan invites me himself.

242
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,353
I know. This sucks.

243
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,837
Yup. Tell me about it.

244
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,196
The day has finally come.
Sandy Cohen is leaving me.

245
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,635
Sorry. No such luck.
I found Ryan's mom.

246
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,794
- She's in Albuquerque.
- New Mexico?

247
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,474
Can't you just call her?

248
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,871
Oh, it's not quite that simple.
I think she might be in some trouble.

249
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,114
What kind of trouble?

250
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,874
Give me a ride to the airport,
I'll tell you on the way.

251
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,230
Neil, hi, it's me.

252
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,595
I thought we were meeting.

253
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:29,470
I guess not. Well, call me
when you get this, okay?

254
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,470
- Summer, hi.
- Julie.

255
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,790
What a surprise.

256
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,393
Is my dad here?

257
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,069
No, I don't think he is.

258
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,917
But you are probably wondering
how I let myself in here.

259
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,595
You know, it's really a funny story.

260
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,876
Kind of... It's absurd, actually.

261
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,996
- I know.
- Excuse me?

262
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,720
I know about you and my dad.
Your private hanky-panky...

263
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,075
...your driving-range smooching.
I know.

264
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,630
- Summer, we were gonna tell you.
- Before or after you went on the cruise?

265
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,918
What cruise?

266
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,070
"A lovers' cruise to Cabo"?

267
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,591
And it leaves tomorrow night. What...?

268
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,671
I didn't know anything
about this, Summer.

269
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,035
I guess Neil wanted to surprise me.

270
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,279
And it's first class.
Oh, my gosh. What a gentleman.

271
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,151
Well, he was gonna surprise you,
all right.

272
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,756
Did you know that he proposed
to his past two wives on cruises?

273
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,117
- What?
- I got nothing against you, in theory...

274
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,430
...but my dad just got out
of a marriage...

275
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,114
...and I don't want him
rushing back into another.

276
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,355
Oh, Summer, I totally understand.

277
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,159
We are nowhere near close
to getting engaged. Trust me.

278
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,471
- You serious?
- Yes, of course.

279
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,628
- Does Marissa know about this?
- Not yet.

280
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,155
Well, I guess I'd better tell her then.

281
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,558
And buy me a new bikini.

282
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,790
Awkward.

283
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,313
I'm here to see Dawn Atwood.

284
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,119
- Third one down.
- Thank you.

285
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,671
Hello, Dawn.

286
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,071
Sandy. What are you doing here?

287
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,953
Well, tomorrow
is Ryan's 18th birthday.

288
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,838
I'm here to invite you to the party.

289
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,154
But...

290
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,228
- Does Ryan know I'm in here?
- No.

291
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,875
And as far as I'm concerned,
he never has to.

292
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,076
So, what happened?

293
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,152
The old story.

294
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,032
I hooked up with this guy,
and lots of drinking...

295
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,636
...and the money ran out.
And then he did.

296
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,075
And then you started
writing bad checks.

297
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,431
Oh, Dawn, you could have called us.

298
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,310
Yeah, I'm sorry.

299
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,592
Well, I'm gonna
take a look at your file.

300
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,558
- Maybe there's something I can do.
- How is he?

301
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,156
He's good.

302
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,039
You can be very proud.

303
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,712
So, what's up?

304
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,314
Well, Detective Warner
stopped by the office.

305
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,994
He's done with his investigation
into Johnny's death.

306
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,150
I thought you might want this.

307
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,028
I'd have had Sandy do it,
but he's out of town, so...

308
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,355
The letter I wrote to Johnny.

309
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,399
Sorry. This is a client.
I have to take this.

310
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,677
- Okay.
- Hi, this is Matt.

311
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,037
- So, what, are you stalking me now?
- What are you talking about?

312
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,589
Well, tonight? Yesterday?

313
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,557
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

314
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,517
- Okay. Then leave me alone.
- Wait.

315
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,114
- Let go of me.
- Relax. Harper dying and all...

316
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,077
...you're going through stuff...
- Marissa.

317
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,716
- What's going on? Guy bothering you?
- Who's this? New protector?

318
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,358
- You need to walk away.
- Or what?

319
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,988
- You gonna hit me with your phone?
- What's going on?

320
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,312
Is there a problem?

321
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,278
Officer, this guy was bothering her,
I just stepped in.

322
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,477
- Yes, officer. Would you save us...?
- Oh, just shut it.

323
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,029
- Come on, man, are you seriously...?
- I said shut it!

324
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,277
Tell you what. You two? Take a walk.

325
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,874
- You, I wanna see some ID.
- Come on.

326
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,833
Now! I wanna see some ID.

327
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,118
Ryan Atwood, legal adult,
happy birthday, man.

328
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,589
- Yeah, thanks.
- So you feeling more mature...

329
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,796
...like you wanna
go out vote up a storm?

330
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,874
Fighting the urge.

331
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,315
Yeah, you've been getting
phone calls all morning?

332
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,675
Yep. Sandy called from Albuquerque.

333
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,594
Says he's gonna make it back,
finish his business before the party.

334
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,354
Anyone else?

335
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,318
Marissa has not called,
and I'm not expecting her to.

336
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,199
- I didn't invite her to the party.
- The wisdom of years.

337
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,112
I'm glad you made your decision.

338
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,396
At least it won't be awkward
with Sadie there.

339
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,597
- Yeah, she can't come.
- Did you tell her Marissa's not going?

340
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,478
She probably wanted
to give you space.

341
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,110
She said she wasn't coming before
I mentioned I might invite Marissa.

342
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,032
She knew you
hadn't made up your mind.

343
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,192
Tell her where you stand now,
see if that changes her answer.

344
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,998
And you might want to mention...

345
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,116
...though I don't wanna overhype...

346
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,352
...there's gonna be
a surprise at this party...

347
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,112
...that may make her head explode.

348
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,559
You know, the short stack
really is the perfect amount.

349
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,675
Look, Mom,
this is great and everything...

350
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,511
Okay. I'm sorry. I'll stop stalling.

351
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,638
The truth is,
I asked you to breakfast for a reason.

352
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,798
For the past few months...

353
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,430
...I've been seeing Neil Roberts.
- Dr. Roberts?

354
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,352
Wait, what have you had done?

355
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,516
Not seeing that way.
I mean, "seeing" seeing.

356
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,188
Although, he probably
would give a couple of freebies.

357
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,630
Oh, my God, you've been
dating Summer's dad?

358
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,314
I was going to tell you.
We thought we'd wait until...

359
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,040
...we knew if it was,
you know, serious.

360
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,078
- And? Is it?
- He's taking me on a cruise to Cabo.

361
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,198
In fact, we leave tonight.
So yes, it feels serious.

362
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,591
- Please, tell me you're okay with this.
- I mean, it's a little weird...

363
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,193
...but, yeah, I guess.

364
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,316
Oh, honey, thank you
for being supportive.

365
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,994
Yeah, just, Summer's,
like, my best friend.

366
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,674
So don't do anything.

367
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,871
Okay. Whatever that means.

368
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,358
So you go, and I'll pay <i>la cuenta.</i>

369
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,398
That's Spanish. I bought
these tapes to impress Neil.

370
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:45,350
- That's great, Mom. I'm happy for you.
- Okay. Go. Fling. Bye.

371
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,389
Sandy, I still don't understand
how you did this.

372
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,869
I made some calls.
The charges are dropped.

373
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,033
In exchange, you will enroll
in a substance-abuse program...

374
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,589
...and make restitution
to the people you defrauded.

375
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,558
- Well, I don't have the money for that.
- I took care of it.

376
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,513
And you don't owe me anything.

377
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,269
All you have to do is go to your son's
birthday party. The plane leaves at 5.

378
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,714
Sandy...

379
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,669
...I don't know.

380
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,396
Sure you do. You're his mother.
And he is gonna want to see you.

381
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,551
Come on.

382
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,829
Okay, I gotta take a shower,
I gotta change my clothes.

383
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,673
All right, well, my hotel is nearby.

384
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,239
I think you have time.

385
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,756
So I got you something.

386
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,956
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

387
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,595
I wanted to commemorate
the time we spent together.

388
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,432
Yeah, I can see that.

389
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,068
I engraved the handle myself.

390
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,676
"For Ryan, happy 18th.
I'm so grateful for your friendship.

391
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,038
Think of me every time
you pound something. Sadie."

392
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,760
- Too mushy?
- No, it's just the right amount of mush.

393
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,319
It's great. Thank you.

394
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,040
Okay. Well, I'm gonna,
I should probably get going...

395
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,952
...and take a shower. I have a...

396
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,754
I have a long drive to L.A.

397
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,834
Just so you know,
I didn't invite Marissa to the party.

398
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,397
Yeah, I decided...

399
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,120
...it wasn't what I wanted.

400
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,038
Okay.

401
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,394
Ryan...

402
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,074
...the reason I can't come
to your party...

403
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,800
...the friend I was meeting in L. A...

404
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,032
...that's the guy I was seeing.
He just wants to talk things over.

405
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,430
- So, what does that mean?
- I don't know.

406
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,478
I guess it means
I finally have to make a decision.

407
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,230
Okay. Well, see you later.
And thanks again.

408
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,911
Sure. Hey...

409
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,072
...happy birthday.

410
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,393
Hi.

411
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,392
Excuse me?

412
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,309
Those guys said
that you're friends with Volchok?

413
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,836
- I need to find him.
- Why? You two hooked up a few times...

414
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,560
...now he won't return your calls?

415
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,228
- Take my advice, forget it.
- It's not like that.

416
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,397
I was friends with
Johnny Harper. And...

417
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,032
It's complicated.

418
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,436
Well, I haven't seen him in a while.
Since Harper died, he's been weird.

419
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,348
But you could try this guy
he used to work for.

420
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,598
- Hi.
- Hi.

421
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,354
I'm glad I got your message,
but isn't this a little...

422
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,432
Public? I know. But I'm afraid
the cat's out of the bag.

423
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,670
- The girls know.
- What? How?

424
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,230
I don't know. Summer confronted me,
and then I had to tell Marissa.

425
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,396
- How did they take it?
- They were great.

426
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,120
Everything is, is...
Oh, Neil, I'm so sorry.

427
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,198
I know you wanted this to be
a surprise, but I'm too excited.

428
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,517
- I would love to go to Cabo with you.
- Cabo?

429
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,551
Summer found
the tickets and told me.

430
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,751
I hope I didn't ruin it
by saying anything.

431
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,911
Well, that'll teach me
to try and be clever.

432
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,035
It's so romantic, waiting till
the day we leave to tell me.

433
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,989
Yeah, that's right.
We leave tonight?

434
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,551
That's pretty romantic.

435
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,318
This is just what we need.

436
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,034
If you hadn't planned it,
I'd swear it was fate.

437
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,832
Maybe it is.

438
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,636
Look at me. I'm gonna
go check my makeup.

439
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,389
After all, I wanna be perfect
for our first time in public.

440
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,959
- Hey.
- Hey.

441
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,634
- How'd it go at your friend's house?
- We stopped early.

442
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,314
- She had to get to L.A.
- Sorry I'm not gonna meet her.

443
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,359
Seth said that you decided
not to invite Marissa.

444
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,069
- Yeah.
- Well, that must've been tough.

445
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,992
Was she okay when you told her?

446
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,796
Oh, please tell me
that you talked to her.

447
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,595
- I thought...
- You thought she'd figure it out...

448
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,355
...when she didn't get the invitation?
She's been in your life for two years.

449
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,110
Hey. There you are. We're gonna
head down to The Bait Shop.

450
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,078
- Okay, let me take a shower.
- No, no, it's your birthday...

451
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,676
...you're not lifting a finger.
- You don't wanna spoil Seth's surprise.

452
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,950
That's right.
Take a good look at your head...

453
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,031
...because in a few hours...

454
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,432
Don't you be late.

455
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,870
Think about what I said.

456
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,672
You're 18.

457
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,910
It's time to be an adult.

458
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,553
Hey, Dawn.

459
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,312
It's me.

460
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,717
Hey, come on, we gotta go
if we're gonna make the plane.

461
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,119
Oh, Dawn...

462
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,119
Marissa?

463
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,835
- Need some help?
- Yeah, I'm looking for Kevin Volchok.

464
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,468
Inside. Back there.

465
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,839
You okay?

466
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,632
The house just looks familiar.

467
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,070
McMansions.
They all look the same to me.

468
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,477
Who's stalking who now?

469
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,199
I wanted to talk to you.

470
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,912
My boss is outside if you came
to get me fired.

471
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,919
I just wanted to say sorry. Okay?
Matt was being overprotective.

472
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,719
Matt. New boyfriend?

473
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,190
- Yeah, he was a real badass, that one.
- He's not my boyfriend.

474
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,233
Look, I just came to say sorry.

475
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,833
And you did.

476
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,718
So now what?

477
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,470
You know, for once I actually thought
you were gonna be nice.

478
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,832
That's pretty stupid.

479
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,514
- Obviously.
- Volchok.

480
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,833
What did I tell you about smoking?
Place already burned down once.

481
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,475
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

482
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,111
So do you want him to stay here?

483
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,153
This is supposed
to be the model home.

484
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,949
- Look, I haven't told anybody that.
- I can keep a secret.

485
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,400
I don't know if it's a good idea
for me to stick around.

486
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,118
You should stay.

487
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,795
Maybe I could spend the night.

488
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,113
You all right?

489
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,831
Yeah. I'm fine.

490
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,274
We're from different worlds.

491
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,879
That's not true.

492
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,354
I'm not like you.

493
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,318
You okay?

494
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,598
Get some help!

495
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,870
So, what exactly
was the thinking here?

496
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,396
Well, turning 18 is all about
assuming your adult identity, right?

497
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,836
So I thought I would show you
the different avenues available to you.

498
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,789
- Because I might want to be a cowboy.
- Or my personal favorite but no less gay.

499
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,598
Fireman Ryan.

500
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,593
Yep, yep, yep.

501
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,593
And the best part,
this isn't even the real surprise.

502
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,548
Can't wait for that.
So who are all these people anyway?

503
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,678
At a certain point, I just needed
to fill the room with bodies.

504
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,549
You know what I mean? You invited,
like, one person. Who did not come.

505
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,554
Two guys got in a fight over the crudités
and knocked down scientist Ryan.

506
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,075
I met them outside Ralph's.
They seemed cool.

507
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,911
Where are your keys?

508
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,358
It's not locked, you just have to...

509
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,315
Give me your ice pack.

510
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,634
You don't have to do this, you know.
The doctor said I was fine.

511
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,033
It was nice of you
to take me to the hospital.

512
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,079
Yeah, you... You wanna tell me
what happened out there?

513
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,990
Doubt you'd be interested.

514
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,798
Well, you know
how that house burned down?

515
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:37,711
I was there that night, with Ryan, and
it just sort of came back to me at once.

516
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,354
Yeah, you're right.
I'm not interested.

517
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,950
You know, if you've got something
to say, now would be the time.

518
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,756
All right, look...

519
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,231
It's just... You know, when
your mom will say, like...

520
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,392
..."Why can't you be more like Timmy?"
Well, that was Harper.

521
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,351
And it pissed me off, but I got it.
You know, things were...

522
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,556
Things were supposed
to work out for him.

523
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,356
But he died,
and it doesn't make sense.

524
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,158
So...

525
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,072
What're you doing?

526
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,512
Giving you my number.

527
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,509
Just in case something happens, or...

528
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,278
I gotta go.

529
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,834
- Dad.
- Hey, Summer, there you are, hi.

530
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,718
- Hey.
- Julie said she talked to you.

531
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,038
Yeah, after I confronted her.

532
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,796
Those tickets for
the cruise were a shock.

533
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,473
Yeah. To me too.

534
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,710
Between us, I wasn't
planning on taking Julie.

535
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,632
What, how many
girlfriends do you have?

536
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:19,550
Hey, I bought those tickets months ago
to salvage things with your stepmother.

537
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,269
I was gonna propose to her
all over again. I even had a ring.

538
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,469
- Oh, my God.
- Well, maybe it's a sign.

539
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,154
I mean, I really do care for Julie.

540
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,509
Well, I'm not gonna say
that it isn't weird, but...

541
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,669
...as long as she makes you happy,
I guess that's all that matters.

542
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,279
Thank you.

543
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,799
I gotta run.
The ship sails at midnight.

544
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,238
- You and Marissa are gonna be okay?
- Yeah, of course.

545
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,914
Hey, Dad, if you really do like her...

546
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,992
...maybe don't wear the bathing suit
you bought in Rome.

547
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,798
Just a thought.

548
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,629
This looks like it has the hand
of Seth over it.

549
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,519
- Yeah, I kind of like this one.
- Happy birthday.

550
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,796
- Hey.
- Sorry, I'm late.

551
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,359
It's all right.

552
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,034
How'd things go in Albuquerque?

553
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,078
- I'm gonna come clean with you.
- Yeah?

554
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,836
I went to see your mother.

555
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,590
She wanted to make it here,
but she couldn't.

556
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,512
She's glad you're doing well.

557
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,592
And I told her she could be very,
very proud of you.

558
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,834
Is she all right?

559
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,352
She's having a bit of a hard time.
But I know where she is...

560
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,910
...so I'll be able to check up on her.
- That's not your responsibility.

561
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,597
Well, as of today, we may no longer
be your legal guardians...

562
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,036
...but you will always
be part of this family.

563
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,235
And she sent you this.

564
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,636
<i>We're from different worlds.</i>

565
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,153
<i>Go.</i>

566
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,713
Hey.

567
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,597
- I thought you were in L.A.
- I told him I couldn't make it.

568
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,589
It felt like time to make a choice.

569
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,239
Glad you came.

570
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,317
Hey. Guys, there's somebody...

571
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,119
...I'd like you to meet: Sadie.
This is Sandy and Kirsten.

572
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,596
Any friend of Ryan's, and it is nice
to know he has at least one here.

573
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,320
- That's funny. I like that.
- It's nice to meet you.

574
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,879
You too.

575
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,033
- So this is your family?
- Yeah. This is them.

576
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,078
- Hey, what'd you forget?
- Passport.

577
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,038
They'd never let me off the boat
without it. Go to the car...

578
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,033
...wait for me. I'll turn out the lights.
- Okay. Neil...

579
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,717
...I just can't tell you how excited
I am about the trip and us.

580
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,751
- I feel the same way.
- Okay. Okay.

581
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,638
I'll be right there.

582
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,630
So you called.

583
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,754
Well, will you sit with me, at least?

584
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,070
Excuse me, may I have
everyone's attention?

585
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,350
As we all know,
or as a few of us know...

586
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,308
...today is Ryan Atwood's
18th birthday.

587
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,079
Thank you.
That was really touching.

588
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,111
So to help celebrate, we have
a tribute to his favorite band.

589
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,111
Please take it away.

590
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,958
Awesome surprise or what, man?

591
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,190
I figured, I couldn't get
the real Journey...

592
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,272
...but a Journey tribute band:
next best thing.

593
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,908
- It's amazing. Thank you.
- Let's do it like this.

594
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,832
- All right. Thanks.
- For you, anything.

595
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,355
- All right. If you'll excuse me.
- Okay.

596
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,750
You do know
this is a Foreigner song, right?

597
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,195
- Yeah.
- Okay.

598
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,310
I didn't know Journey sang this song.

599
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,710
They don't. I got
a Foreigner cover band instead.

600
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,314
They're about 10 times
cooler than Journey.

601
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,471
