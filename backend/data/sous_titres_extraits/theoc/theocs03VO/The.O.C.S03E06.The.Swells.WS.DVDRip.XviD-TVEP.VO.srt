1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,149
<i>Previously on</i> The O. C:

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,197
I'm doing the right thing,
closing down the Newport Group.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,475
You're putting the past behind you.

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,631
- How much?
- lf you need help with the payment...

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,757
I'm not destitute, Kirsten. I'm discerning.

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,235
- You bought me a condo.
- Julie, I don't want anything from you.

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,238
- It's all yours.
- I don't have any friends.

8
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,159
I don't trust people
and so I try to control them...

9
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,873
...which then drives them away...

10
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,155
...ergo, no friends.

11
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,353
Hey. What's wrong?
What did you do to her?

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,199
Nothing. I'm fine.

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,437
See your girl, talking to a guy you
don't know, could happen to anyone.

14
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,551
My life just doesn't work without you.

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,320
And it always goes so smooth
when we're together.

16
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,873
<i>My life just doesn 't work without you.</i>

17
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,392
- Get off of me!
- He's my brother!

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,432
Trey, get off of him, please!

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,670
You're killing him!

20
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,111
- Yeah.
- Hey, it's me.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,831
- You okay?
- No.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,514
I mean, yes, but I had a dream.

23
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,513
Trey was there, and so were you,
and it was happening all over.

24
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,628
Look, I'm sorry to wake you up, okay?
I'm just scared.

25
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,190
I know, I know,
but you don't have to be.

26
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,073
Trey's gone.

27
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,915
Everything's fine.

28
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,993
Why don't you go back to sleep. I'll talk
to you tomorrow, okay?

29
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,559
Okay.

30
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,838
Hey.

31
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,352
Nightmares, huh?

32
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,318
You know, at first I thought
you were just a sweaty sleeper.

33
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,517
Didn't want to say anything, but...

34
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,558
I guess I thought if I slept with you,
they'd go away.

35
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,598
You talk to Ryan about it?

36
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,589
I tried. But I mean,
you know how he is.

37
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,273
Yeah. Not much with words.

38
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,829
And he went through it with me.
He should understand.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,513
I know.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,672
Well, I'm here.

41
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,398
What?

42
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,239
I just wish that Ryan knew that
that was all he had to say.

43
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,873
Yeah.

44
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,715
- So you have your new class schedule?
- Right here.

45
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,598
- You got all your supplies?
- In the bag.

46
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,751
He's been to school.
He knows how to do it.

47
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,957
- We're just glad you're back at Harbor.
- Make sure nothing goes wrong.

48
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,509
- Dr. Kim was very clear.
- I know, I know.

49
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,069
I can't get in any trouble, and I won't.

50
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,309
Don't worry.

51
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,634
- Just you and me.
- How about another cup of coffee?

52
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,637
Don't mind if I do.

53
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,593
You and me
and the house to ourselves?

54
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,436
- I could get used to this.
- lf I never set foot in an office again...

55
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,558
Hopefully you won't have to.
I found a buyer for the Newport Group.

56
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,512
Music to my ears.

57
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,148
Well, if the meeting
goes well tomorrow...

58
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,754
...I'll sign the papers.
- Then sayonara, Newport Group.

59
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,473
- Are you okay with that?
- With what?

60
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,473
Walking away from the company
that your father built?

61
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,119
You spent 15 years there.

62
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,959
And it took me that long
to realize I hated it.

63
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,076
Oh, Sandy, I'm ready to let it go.

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,197
Ryan and Marissa haven't broken up
in weeks. It's gotta be a new record.

65
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,557
Well, but I feel a breakup coming.
I have a sixth sense about those two.

66
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,995
They break up, they get
back together. Whatever.

67
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,310
It's a natural cycle,
it has to do with the tide.

68
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,233
It's different now. If they
break up, Marissa could disappear.

69
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,631
She could get swallowed by Newport
Union. It's like the Bermuda Triangle.

70
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,792
It's a school. It's two miles away.

71
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,157
Look, I don't care. Those two need
to log in some serious couple time...

72
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,153
...or our little foursome's
gonna shrink to about half.

73
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,834
Hey, man, how's it feel being back?

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,718
- We're gonna go get coffee.
- Excellent.

75
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,030
It's good, you know,
I've got a lot of work to do.

76
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,633
Yeah, I gotta study all weekend.

77
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,189
Well, you can't study all weekend,
we got plans.

78
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,351
- We do?
- Yeah, Cohen invited Marissa and I...

79
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,193
...over for dinner. You can't hide
from us in your own home.

80
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,557
I should back off for a while. Having
me back in school can't be easy...

81
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,950
...for Marissa.
At least I can give her some space.

82
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,793
Space? No, who needs space?
Marissa, she likes a short leash.

83
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,757
Yeah. Listen, dinner
tonight at my house.

84
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,229
I'm sure my mom's cooking
something disgusting.

85
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,356
- Hi, can we have three coffees, please?
- Sure.

86
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,238
- Thank you.
- All right, fine. Dinner.

87
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,354
Oh, God, incoming.

88
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,233
Hey, guys, have you heard
about the lock-in tomorrow night?

89
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,236
The entire senior class
is gonna spend the night in the gym.

90
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,589
- Yes!
- Oh, we can't make it.

91
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,716
Yeah. I'm taking off
my arm with a hacksaw.

92
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,038
Oh, well, that's a shame,
you're gonna have to miss that.

93
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,390
Lock-in's mandatory, counts as a class.

94
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,199
And I know you can't afford any cuts.

95
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,032
- We'll be there.
- Super.

96
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,714
It's gonna be a blast.
We're even gonna make S'mores.

97
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,348
We're using Bunsen burners
to simulate camp fires.

98
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,636
It's just a little idea I came up with.

99
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,354
Oh, my God. That's genius.

100
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,155
Well, remember, all you need to bring
is a sleeping bag...

101
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,719
...and an open mind.

102
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,592
There goes our Saturday night.

103
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,475
Oh, I almost forgot,
I'm gonna need a few guys...

104
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,518
...to help me set up tomorrow night,
so Seth and Ryan...

105
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,278
Figured you'd both be up for it.

106
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,675
I mean, I did pretty much
get you back into school.

107
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,949
So I'll see you tomorrow at 2.

108
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,878
And there goes
the rest of our weekend.

109
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,877
- Hey, guys.
- Marissa!

110
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,510
- Hey, you ready for this weekend?
- I don't know, what's this weekend?

111
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,511
The swells are coming
from Antarctica...

112
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,511
...which means we're
gonna get some height.

113
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,234
- Okay, I have no idea what that means.
- I forgot.

114
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,436
Born and raised in Newport,
never surfed a wave.

115
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,200
- That's me.
- It means, after the flattest season ever...

116
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,634
...we're getting some waves.

117
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,558
We like to welcome these swells...

118
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,518
...with an ancient ritual known
as Dawn Patrol.

119
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,280
Does that mean you stay up
and party before you surf?

120
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,715
- She's not hopeless.
- You should come with us.

121
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,111
Some of us are gonna hang out tonight,
though festivities start tomorrow.

122
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,350
Yeah. Maybe we'll even
teach you a few moves.

123
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,909
Or I'll just sit on the sand and watch?

124
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,270
Come on, Chili, we have physics.

125
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,398
Dawn Patrol, tonight.
Grande awesomeness.

126
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,951
- You got a free period too?
- Yeah.

127
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,909
You okay? You look a little tired.

128
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,389
Gee, thanks.

129
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,754
Sorry.

130
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,353
No, it's okay.

131
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,115
I haven't really been sleeping at all.

132
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,670
- Too much coffee?
- No, I don't think it's that.

133
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,911
Bad dreams?

134
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,232
Maybe, something like that.

135
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,478
Come on. Let's hit
the vending machines, my treat.

136
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,358
How could I say no?

137
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,715
- Hey.
- Hey.

138
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,548
Good news. The movers
showed up with my stuff.

139
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,395
- Our place is almost livable.
- Wonderful, we should celebrate.

140
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,630
In fact, I should
throw you a housewarming.

141
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,872
Oh, well, thanks, but you've
already done enough favors for me.

142
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,752
- It's getting creepy.
- Oh, come on...

143
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,512
...I'm gonna be going to Aspen.

144
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,478
Marissa's gonna move in,
and you two will forget all about me.

145
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,198
Let me throw a party before I go.

146
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,113
I don't know, I'm a little low
on the friends these days.

147
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,277
Everybody bailed when
you lost your money.

148
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,078
You should see them in Cardio Barre.

149
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,959
They don't even look me in the eye.
I used to rule that class.

150
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,196
Same thing happened
when I got out of rehab.

151
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,157
All the New York women just iced me.

152
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,470
- How did you deal?
- Well, I thought about leaving.

153
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,198
But instead I threw a party.

154
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,036
A black tie benefit. It was
the smartest thing I could have done.

155
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,198
It raised a lot of money for a good cause,
and I got my life back.

156
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,756
Yeah, well, I can't throw those anymore.
I don't have the cash or the clout.

157
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,629
Well, I can help you.
Of course, we'd need Kirsten, but...

158
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,637
It would really be good for you, Julie.

159
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,751
I think you should think about it.

160
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,359
- Hey.
- Hey, you up for dinner tonight?

161
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,715
- The Cohens wanna have us over.
- Sure.

162
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,077
But I'm gonna have to meet you there.
I told Johnny I'd hang with him.

163
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,151
Again with the Johnny.

164
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,151
Casey and Chili are gonna be there too.

165
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,074
I guess these swells are coming in,
and if you're a surfer, it's like Christmas.

166
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,151
You should come by tomorrow.
Check it out.

167
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,788
You know, I would.
I have to be imprisoned in the gym...

168
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,678
...and forced to eat S'mores.

169
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,469
Yeah, I wish I was kidding.

170
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,796
Wow, that sounds like
a Taylor Townsend event.

171
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,076
Some days,
I really don't miss life at Harbor.

172
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,319
- So I guess I'll see you at the Cohens'.
- Okay.

173
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,152
See you.

174
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,798
Wouldn't wanna be you.

175
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,312
Hey, where is everyone?

176
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,552
Casey's on her way.

177
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,631
Chili's still out there.

178
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,313
See in the distance...

179
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,630
...that kid wiping out?

180
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,429
- You caught me on a break. Wanna sit?
- Sure.

181
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,670
It's so beautiful out here.

182
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,671
It almost makes me wish I surfed.

183
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,512
Yeah, I'm telling you...

184
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,557
...it helped me.

185
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,679
You know, with my sleep.

186
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,548
With everything, really.

187
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,954
You wanna talk about it?

188
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,111
I don't know about you,
but I'm freezing.

189
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,430
I'm gonna grab a sweatshirt.
You wanna come?

190
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,431
Sure. Let me just call Summer.

191
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,633
Do you have to go?

192
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,439
No. No, it's okay.

193
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,154
What are you making?

194
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,790
- Beef stew.
- Can't we order out like normal people?

195
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,473
We are normal people.

196
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,039
Normal people cook.

197
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,114
I wonder if my poor mouth
will ever taste pizza again.

198
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,955
Probably not, because we are very
abusive parents, cooking for you like this.

199
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,998
- Hey.
- Hey, Summer!

200
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,278
- You're just in time. I hope you like stew.
- Oh, it's my favorite.

201
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,118
- Where's Marissa?
- She can't make it.

202
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,599
- She's busy.
- Is she studying?

203
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,035
I've been known to get her
to blow off some homework.

204
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,559
She's not studying.

205
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,950
She's at the beach with Johnny.

206
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,758
- Ryan, try not to punch Summer.
- I'm just the messenger.

207
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,076
It's all right.
I mean, she's with her friend.

208
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,549
- She has to hang out with him.
- Probably got held up.

209
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,789
Yeah.

210
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,991
Well, I guess there'll be
more beef stew for everyone.

211
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,959
- You want one?
- Yeah, sure.

212
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,952
Thanks.

213
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,312
Central Varsity Baseball.

214
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,072
I didn't know you played.

215
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,595
I don't. Not anymore.

216
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,911
Quit everything when I moved here.

217
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,197
New town, new sports.

218
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,556
I just wanna start over.

219
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,999
What?

220
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,198
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

221
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,632
It was my dad.

222
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,392
We had a...

223
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,119
...fight.

224
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,834
I haven't seen him since.

225
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,031
And when was that?

226
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,834
I don't know, like three years ago.

227
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,797
- Four.
- Have you tried calling him...

228
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,678
...or contacting him?

229
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,678
It's not that easy.

230
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,397
He was a...

231
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,039
...drunk.

232
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,472
He used to always go after my mom.

233
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,231
You mean...?

234
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,511
One night I just snapped.

235
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,635
Came home from baseball practice...

236
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,436
...there he was.

237
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,158
Had her up against the wall...

238
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,915
...his hands around her neck...

239
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,390
I just lost it.

240
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,828
Lost it...?

241
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,111
I took my baseball bat...

242
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,995
I guess I just started beating him.

243
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,476
I don't remember any of it.

244
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,877
But when I came to...

245
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,110
...he was unconscious.

246
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,557
I was covered in his blood.

247
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,233
Oh, God.

248
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,668
You know, when I think
back on that night...

249
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,112
...I don't even know who I was...

250
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,956
...how I could've done that.

251
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,790
I know what you mean.

252
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,074
Johnny, I'm sorry.

253
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,596
You wanna hear something crazy?

254
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,910
You're the first person I've told.

255
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,114
Coop.

256
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,719
Wake up.

257
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,437
Oh, my God. Let me sleep.

258
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,990
Sorry, can't let you do that.
I waited up till like a million o'clock.

259
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,072
- Where were you?
- I...

260
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,595
- I was with Johnny.
- Yeah.

261
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,354
While I had fun explaining
that you couldn't make dinner...

262
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,432
...because you were off romping
on the beach with some surfer guy.

263
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,830
Oh, I know. I'm sorry I missed it.

264
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,594
- I meant to be there.
- Yeah, well, you weren't.

265
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,070
And now I'm finding just
suspicious articles of clothing...

266
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,073
...lying around the room
belonging to strange men.

267
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,559
I've seen <i>Unfaithful,</i> Coop.

268
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,349
- I know the signs.
- Summer, I would never cheat on Ryan.

269
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,351
- Ever.
- Okay.

270
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,273
I knew that, I just needed
to hear you say it.

271
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,751
Why are you blowing off
your boyfriend...

272
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,478
...to hang out with
some random guy?

273
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,069
- He needed to talk.
- That's what his girlfriend's for.

274
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,516
- He needed to talk to me.
- Because he likes you.

275
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,148
He doesn't like me.
We just have stuff in common.

276
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,670
Yeah, he's a surfer, you're a shopper.
Totally make the connection.

277
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,157
He went through something.

278
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,399
Something like I went through,
and, I don't know, he just gets me.

279
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,874
Okay, so, Johnny gets you,
and what, Ryan doesn't?

280
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,150
I didn't say that.

281
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,870
He doesn't have a crush on me,
has a girlfriend.

282
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,519
And if you don't believe me...

283
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,956
...then why don't you come
to the beach with us later?

284
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,313
Fine. I can go before the lock-in.

285
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,195
But you have to find your boyfriend
and apologize to him for last night.

286
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,748
- So have you talked to Marissa yet?
- I got a message from her late last night.

287
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,831
No explanation, just says she's sorry.

288
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,956
She's gonna stop by later today.

289
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,878
Right on cue.

290
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,792
- Hey.
- Hey.

291
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,075
I'm sorry about last night.
You must be mad at me.

292
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,754
No, I'm just curious. Where were you?

293
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,399
I was talking to Johnny.

294
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,157
- About?
- It's personal.

295
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,191
I know how bad
that sounds, it's just...

296
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,590
Trust me, there's nothing
between me and him.

297
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,552
No, no, I believe you, I just...

298
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,995
I just wanna make sure you're all right.

299
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,149
What's up?

300
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,877
Well, I'm still dealing with
all of this stuff with Trey.

301
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,592
Ryan. We're on the clock here.
Chop-chop.

302
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,477
It's okay. I'll see you later.

303
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,910
Mr. Cohen, Kurt Williams.
It's nice to meet you.

304
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,150
- Nice to meet you.
- My associate, Matt Ramsey.

305
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,470
- A rising star in our company.
- Good to meet you.

306
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,198
Come on in, gentlemen, have a seat.

307
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,590
- All right.
- Thank you. Mr. Cohen...

308
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,634
...Matt and I are thrilled at the prospect
of taking over the Newport Group.

309
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,675
Well, I'm thrilled to sell it to you.

310
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,276
- But I do have a condition. Only one.
- Of course.

311
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,038
The Martinson Complex.

312
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,430
They're low-income properties
down by the water.

313
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,119
You've done your homework.

314
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,317
I fought my late father-in-law
tooth and nail to get those up.

315
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,595
And now I...

316
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,195
I gotta know
they won't be destroyed.

317
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,476
Even if they
don't bring in much revenue.

318
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,353
I totally agree, Mr. Cohen.
It's properties like those...

319
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,192
...that are the heart of a company.

320
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,076
Absolutely. Mr. Cohen,
I'd like to assure you...

321
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,999
...that I intend to keep
Caleb Nichol's legacy in place.

322
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,956
You're not gonna knock
them and build a shop?

323
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,071
You have my word.

324
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,352
All right.

325
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,112
Terrific.

326
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,117
I made these myself.

327
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,316
They should keep us
psyched into the wee hours.

328
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,198
Yeah, you're talented.

329
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,396
- Taylor.
- Okay, I'll put them up.

330
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,637
- Mom, hi.
- Hurry, I'm running late.

331
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,870
I have your party favors in the car.

332
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,592
These your prisoners?

333
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,355
They look like they wanna be
here just about as much as I do.

334
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,277
Tape would be a good idea.

335
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,719
Taylor.

336
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,313
Taylor, do we have any...?

337
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,789
I mean, really, Taylor.
Iocking in a bunch of kids...

338
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,951
...so you don't spend
Saturday night alone?

339
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,230
- Mom, that's not why I'm doing it.
- Baloney.

340
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,472
You're doing it because you're Ionely.

341
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,671
If you'd just loosen up
a little, you would...

342
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,150
I would be one of the
popular girls. I know, Mom.

343
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,513
I'm off to the club.
If you need me, I'll be on my cell.

344
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,235
Taylor, un-tuck your shirt.

345
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,118
Your ass is so not made for low-riders.

346
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,473
Got it.

347
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,710
So they're, like,
really into surfing here, huh?

348
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,236
Yup. It seems to be kind of
a Newport Union obsession.

349
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,278
- Marissa!
- Hey, everyone.

350
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,674
- This is Summer.
- Hey.

351
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,319
Oh, man, I should have known.

352
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,472
- Hot chicks always travel in packs.
- Like wolves?

353
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,314
- That's Chili.
- Hi.

354
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,790
Don't listen to anything that he says.
We think he was dropped on his head.

355
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,235
It makes sense.
Well, it's nice to meet you guys.

356
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,158
- You too.
- Hey, Johnny.

357
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,790
I see you found yourself
a couple of new groupies.

358
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,956
Summer, Marissa, this is Volchok.

359
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,912
He likes to think he owns the waves.

360
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,115
- He's gotta be better than you.
- Yeah.

361
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,515
I saw you go for a cutback
out there and wipe.

362
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,908
- It was nice.
- Whatever, man.

363
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,435
No, I'm just saying, you're
gonna have to do better...

364
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,559
...if you wanna get on the PacWest tour.
- Was that the tour you tanked last year?

365
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,280
- Because there were a few.
- Chili, it's cool.

366
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,590
Come on. Let me show you
where we can get drinks.

367
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,637
- Okay.
- Hey, Casey, hold up a second.

368
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,514
I thought you were dating Harper.

369
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,712
- I am.
- This year should be better...

370
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,078
Doesn't look like it.

371
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,549
Casey, come on, let's go.

372
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,269
No, it's been great.
Except for Julie leaving her...

373
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,319
...wet towels all over the house.
- Life without a maid is an adjustment.

374
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,710
I can't believe you two living together.

375
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,269
- You must be having so much fun.
- We are.

376
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,671
We both know how lucky we are to have
survived the last few months...

377
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,269
...so we've been talking about
finding a way to give back.

378
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,552
We wanna throw a charity event.
Black tie, whole nine yards.

379
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,196
For underprivileged women so they can
go to rehab and have a chance to heal.

380
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,436
Well, it sounds like a wonderful cause.

381
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,477
So you'll help us throw it?

382
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,193
Well, actually, I told myself I'd wait
a while before I jumped back into all that.

383
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,755
You know those Newpsies.
Make you wanna drink.

384
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,913
Excuse me.

385
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,909
I'll handle this.

386
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,149
Look, Kiki, you know I am all
for you taking your recovery slowly...

387
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,952
...but I'm just worried about Julie.

388
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,112
If she's ever gonna get on her feet,
she needs a way into society.

389
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,629
I understand, but you two
don't need me for this.

390
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,910
Of course we do,
nobody in this town knows me.

391
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,389
And Julie couldn't get arrested.

392
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,429
Your name on the invitation
would be a huge draw.

393
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,192
I don't know.

394
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,752
Do it for your friend.

395
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,194
She needs you.

396
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,638
Hey.

397
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,395
What are you guys
talking about in here?

398
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,999
I was just telling Charlotte
how I'd love to help.

399
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,429
Really? You would?

400
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,278
I'm in.

401
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,750
Yeah, what's up?

402
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,637
Welcome to my <i>casa.</i>

403
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,349
Hey, Summer. Why don't I give
you a little tour, show you my lair?

404
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,232
You're a dweeb.

405
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,238
- Show me where to drop my stuff?
- Sure. Follow me.

406
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,833
Where's his girlfriend?

407
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,953
I don't know.

408
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,749
Dawn Patrol!

409
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,678
You know what I'm talking about.

410
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,196
So I think this will officially
make you the first girl in Chili's room.

411
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,713
What an honor.

412
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,911
Oh, my God, is this you and Chili?

413
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,838
- I forgot he had that.
- Let me see that.

414
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,672
- Sorry. You can't.
- That's hysterical!

415
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,671
- Come on, please?
- Come on, you look cute.

416
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,279
- Really.
- It's not. A bowl cut...

417
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,795
...Power Rangers underwear. Not cute.
- Yes, it is.

418
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,355
Please? I promise.
What if I promise I won't laugh?

419
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,669
Okay?

420
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,840
- You lied! You liar!
- That's really funny.

421
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,878
- Quit. Come on, no, stop! Come on.
- Please.

422
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,712
- Stop!
- Stop being all sensitive.

423
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,757
- It's embarrassing.
- We can laugh about it.

424
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,478
No, we can't, no.

425
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,988
- Hello.
- Hey, it's me.

426
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,912
Hey. Where are you?

427
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,998
I don't know, Chili's house,
at the end of Dune Road or something?

428
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,953
Okay, are you not aware
that lock-in's mandatory?

429
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,589
I don't care about lock-in.
I just need Ryan to get here.

430
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,910
- <i>It's an emergency.</i>
- Why? What's the problem?

431
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,150
- <i>I can 't get into it right now, but...</i>
- Sorry.

432
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,278
All cell phones must
be surrendered at the door.

433
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,477
The lock-in hasn't even started yet.

434
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,079
Yes, but you're in the gym.

435
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,110
Believe me, by making you
exist in a world...

436
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,875
...where we don't depend on technology
to communicate with one another...

437
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,634
...I'm doing you a very serious favor.

438
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,119
- What was that about?
- I don't know.

439
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,517
Summer said something about you
getting to some house on Dune Road.

440
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,716
- Some emergency.
- Is it Marissa?

441
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,916
I don't know. My cell
phone was confiscated...

442
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,071
...which is a violation
of my civil liberties.

443
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,229
Yeah, I gotta go.

444
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,275
Where do you think you're going,
Ryan Atwood?

445
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,159
If you're not back here by the time
the doors lock at 9 p. m...

446
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,913
...you're in very serious trouble.

447
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,271
Yeah, I gotta go.

448
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,955
I don't get it.
Why don't you like me?

449
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,076
I'm already dating a dork.

450
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,550
- Yeah.
- That kinda gives me inspiration.

451
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,870
I'm wearing you down.

452
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,469
- There you are.
- Yeah, I just needed a little disco nap.

453
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,114
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

454
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,760
I'm gonna go get myself a refill.

455
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,669
I'm fine. It's okay.

456
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,674
Oh, crap.

457
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,198
<i>This is Seth, it's 2005, you</i>
<i>know how these things work.</i>

458
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,191
Oh, why am I getting your voicemail?

459
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,512
Cohen, look, about Ryan, abort mission.
I repeat, abort mission.

460
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,754
Or not. Atwood! Hey.

461
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,358
- You move quickly.
- Yeah, Seth said Marissa's in trouble?

462
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,875
False alarm. You should
get back to the lock-in.

463
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,600
- You don't want to miss the S'mores.
- Why'd you call me?

464
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,869
Well, I...

465
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,792
I was just worried
about Johnny and Marissa.

466
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,077
Johnny? You mean, that Johnny,
"Hanging With His Girlfriend" Johnny?

467
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,555
I have a hair trigger.
Go, before Marissa sees you.

468
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,159
Ryan?

469
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,795
What are you doing here?

470
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,480
- I was just checking up on...
- Me.

471
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,558
He wanted to make sure
that I had a ride to the lock-in.

472
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,069
She's low on gas.

473
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,150
Hey, Ryan, glad you could make it.

474
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,312
Come here, let me show you
where you can get a drink.

475
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,879
I'd love to.

476
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,115
- Matt, thanks for coming.
- Sure.

477
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,475
Is there a problem with the sale, or...

478
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,473
Well, I was hoping
you could tell me about that.

479
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,915
Let's talk about your boss.

480
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,719
Well, he's a brilliant businessman.

481
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,394
But I shouldn't trust him, should I?

482
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,836
That handshake, that smile...

483
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,310
Oh, I've met his type before.
This town is full of them.

484
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,559
This is about
the Martinson Complex, isn't it?

485
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,873
Yes.

486
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,396
I need to know those people
won't be displaced.

487
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,512
I'd love to tell you otherwise,
but Williams is gonna tear down...

488
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,352
...whatever's not making him a bundle.

489
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,476
- Simple as that.
- I appreciate your honesty.

490
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,989
Honesty's not a valued commodity
in this business.

491
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,349
Well...

492
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,397
...to me it is.

493
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,748
Then don't sell to Williams.

494
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,436
Hang on to the company. I'll help you.

495
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,838
I don't know about that.

496
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,197
I'm no businessman. And you don't
look much older than my son.

497
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,272
I'm 26. I graduated
magna cum laude from Berkeley.

498
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,710
- Berkeley?
- I got my MBA in one year at Kellogg.

499
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,836
The last 14 months
I spent under Williams.

500
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,110
Well, that's an impressive résumé.

501
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,311
But there's no substitute
for life experience.

502
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,352
That's what you'll bring to the table.

503
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,796
Me, I'll crunch the numbers,
I'll do all the boring stuff.

504
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,234
Look...

505
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,637
...if you give me this opportunity,
I will work my ass off for you.

506
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,432
I promise.

507
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,395
I've been dodging this business
for the last 20 years.

508
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,795
The change you could bring
to this community if...

509
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,996
...you had control
of a million-dollar company.

510
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,151
Well, I'm gonna have to
think about that.

511
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,275
You know what that means, don't you?

512
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,352
- I gotta ask my wife.
- Of course.

513
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,357
Look, all I'm asking for is a shot.

514
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,476
Six months.

515
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,314
- I was thinking, five grand a person?
- That sounds fair.

516
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,755
- We'll have three courses.
- Fair price.

517
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,113
One sec, it's my dad again.

518
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,873
Hello.

519
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,599
Did you need anything else?

520
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,068
Can you hang on a sec?
My friend is treating.

521
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,952
Actually, just a sec, here.

522
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,438
I'm not sure which one
she wants to use.

523
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,632
You know...

524
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,394
...why don't I just give you cash.

525
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,631
So look, I just want you to know
I'm only here because Summer called me.

526
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,796
Not because you're
freaked out about Johnny?

527
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,355
Well, I wasn't, but I'm
starting to think I should be.

528
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,953
- What's going on with you guys?
- l... I don't know.

529
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,714
I just... I can talk to him.

530
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,758
- About what?
- About...

531
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,836
About Trey, I guess.

532
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,956
- You can't talk to me about it?
- I try.

533
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,190
- I tried the other night.
- At 4 in the morning.

534
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,271
Yeah, and you told me
to go back to sleep.

535
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:30,191
- It's like you pretend it didn't happen.
- Yeah, well, what do you want me to do?

536
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,353
I mean, I can't fix this.
I can't make it go away.

537
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,110
Hey. How's it going?

538
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,838
Great.

539
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,350
Look, I gotta get to the lock-in.

540
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,158
See you.

541
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,272
Guys.

542
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,551
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hey, Ryan, where are you?

543
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,876
- <i>Where's Summer? Get over here.</i>
- I'm leaving.

544
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,951
- See you in a minute.
- <i>Okay, well, hurry up.</i>

545
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,918
All right, I'm freaking out right now.
I'm using a pay phone...

546
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,992
...and God knows what ancient strain
of lip herpes I'm contracting.

547
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,475
That's disgusting.
I'll be there as soon as possible.

548
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,278
Atwood. Wait up.

549
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,074
I'm sorry, I overreacted. I meddled.

550
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,117
- Oh, my God, I'm Seth.
- It's okay.

551
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,471
Look, I just get nervous
that we're gonna lose her, you know?

552
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:18,878
I cannot sleep tonight if you guys don't
make up. Please go back and talk to her?

553
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,109
Where's Ryan?

554
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,799
He's gone. We had an argument.

555
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,672
You should call him.

556
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,677
You'll feel better if you talk to him.

557
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,516
Is there somewhere I could go?
Somewhere quiet?

558
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,597
Yeah. Come with me.

559
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,196
You can use Chili's room.

560
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,271
Johnny.

561
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,595
You get my sponsorship,
I got your girl.

562
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,432
Seems fair to me.

563
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,510
How you doing? Good?

564
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,512
I'm gonna kick Volchok's ass, man.
I mean, I know the dude's crazy.

565
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:16,468
He could probably break me with his bare
hands. But you know what? It's worth it.

566
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,592
Hey, are you okay?

567
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,390
I know where he is too. By the dunes.
You know he's there with his bros.

568
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,313
Johnny, look, if we can do anything,
just let us know, okay?

569
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,674
Thanks, guys.

570
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,479
I think I just need to be alone.

571
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,758
Okay.

572
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,637
I'll get it.

573
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,032
- Casey.
- Is he here?

574
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,915
Yeah, sure.

575
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,155
Look, just so you know,
I'm not a terrible person.

576
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,548
I could just see where
all this was headed.

577
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,830
- What do you mean?
- The way he's looking at you.

578
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,952
All your long, secret talks.

579
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,469
- It's not even like that.
- Wake up, Marissa.

580
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,471
He may not know it yet,
but he's falling in love with you.

581
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,274
And I'm not gonna sit around
and watch that happen.

582
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,192
Johnny's gone.

583
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,152
He went after Volchok.

584
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,830
So you wanna stop and get
a movie on the way home?

585
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,399
Sounds good.

586
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,956
Just answer me one teensy question:

587
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,436
Who the hell are you?

588
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,629
- What?
- You heard me.

589
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,473
I just saw what's in your purse,
half a dozen credit cards...

590
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,868
...all with different names?

591
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,156
You and I've had
a little misunderstanding.

592
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,595
Please. There is not a lie
in the world...

593
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,149
...I haven't heard or told,
so just give it straight.

594
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,476
It'll save us a lot of time.

595
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,756
- I was never gonna hurt you, Julie.
- Right.

596
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,514
You were just gonna scam me
into throwing a fake charity...

597
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,558
...and leave me to pick up the pieces
so you could skip town.

598
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,353
Well, what if you help me?

599
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,638
- Are you drinking again?
- Hear me out.

600
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,198
We'll raise a couple hundred grand,
split it, and I disappear.

601
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,029
You're rich again. Everyone sleeps better,
they think they've helped a good cause.

602
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,593
I'm not a criminal.

603
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,518
You haven't had to be yet.

604
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,956
How are you gonna support your family?
You don't have a man to bail you out.

605
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,793
If you're smart, you'll take
matters into your own hands.

606
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,759
- I thought you loathed corporate America.
- Oh, I do.

607
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,993
I loathe it all. Greed,
Republicans, navy suits.

608
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,957
So why are you considering this?

609
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,475
After your father died,
I shut down my law practice...

610
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,073
...to deal with Newport Group.

611
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,635
This might be a way
to make it all mean something.

612
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,949
Your work and mine.

613
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,871
Well, if this is
something that you want...

614
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,508
...you know I'll support you.
- What about you?

615
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,070
If my taking over the company threatens
any of the progress you've made...

616
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,550
I'm out of the woods now.

617
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,560
It's time for you to get back
to making yourself happy.

618
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,075
Okay, if we could just
move it over to the bleachers...

619
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,755
...that would be great, great.
Everyone, can you make your way...

620
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,559
...over to the bleachers, please?
- Hey, Taylor, Taylor.

621
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,799
How's it going?
So far, this lock-in, it's awesome.

622
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,355
- Not happening, Seth.
- What? What's not happening?

623
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,075
- Kissing ass so I let in Ryan and Summer.
- No, it turns out they got held up.

624
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,754
If you could just cut them
some slack, that'd be great.

625
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,396
Seth, what I'm doing here
is creating an atmosphere of trust.

626
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,434
Now if I give your friends
preferential treatment...

627
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,830
...well, then I've muddled
the message, haven't I?

628
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,757
- What?
- Those doors will lock in 20 minutes.

629
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,559
And if Ryan and Summer aren't here...

630
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,277
You can't save people, Seth.
They need to save themselves.

631
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,871
- Thank you for your help.
- Go sit down. Go on.

632
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,508
Okay, everybody? Hi.

633
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,752
So lock-in hasn't officially started yet...

634
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,230
...but, hey, we can still
start the fun, right?

635
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,515
Who's in the mood for trust falls?

636
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,712
Nobody!

637
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,555
So if you could each find a buddy...

638
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,718
...preferably someone who
you don't know very well...

639
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,638
...or even someone of a different race.

640
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,068
You're a loser.

641
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,559
- Sit down!
- What are you doing?

642
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,188
- I am going to help you.
- I don't need your help.

643
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,430
- Get off my stage, geek.
- Okay, okay.

644
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,752
Okay, well, maybe we'll just
work up to trust falls.

645
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,952
Why don't we turn to
the person next to us...

646
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,111
...and tell them something
about ourselves...

647
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,271
...that they may not already know.

648
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,675
Taylor Townsend sucks!

649
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,192
You gotta watch out for those.

650
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,992
Hi, everybody, my name is Seth Cohen,
of the West Coast Cohens.

651
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,072
I was feeling like we should all play
a game of capture the flag.

652
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,111
- Bite me!
- Now I should warn all of you...

653
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,032
...I'm very talented at this game.

654
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,236
Yeah, I was all-camp
capture the flag, so...

655
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,192
You were all-geek at Camp Geek!

656
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,952
Seth, why are you doing this?

657
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,390
- I can take it, I'm used to it.
- Cohen's a tool.

658
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,994
- Thank you.
- Now, listen...

659
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,276
...everyone to my right,
you're the red team.

660
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,432
Everyone to my left,
you're gonna be the blue team

661
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,234
- I'm so faded.
- Pass that herb, yo.

662
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,038
Hey, check it out. It's Harper.

663
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,555
He's come to whoop Volchok's ass.

664
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,992
- Kevin, we need to talk, man.
- Oh, yeah?

665
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,673
What are you going to do?

666
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,998
How could you do that to me?

667
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,077
- How could you do that to me?
- Back off!

668
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,670
You little bitch! You want more?

669
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,348
- You want some more of that?
- Back off!

670
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,909
Come on, come on.
No, no, no.

671
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,554
- Don't worry. Don't worry about it.
- Yeah, watch it.

672
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,754
- Get that bitch out of here.
- You know what? Hold on.

673
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,148
I forgot to do something.

674
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,994
Let's get him.

675
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,638
Stay away from him. Come on.

676
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,232
- Come on.
- Let's just kill them.

677
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,839
Not tonight, guy.

678
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,632
I think some drinks are in order.

679
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,472
Bartender, two shots of Patrón.

680
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,148
Oh, I haven't had tequila in forever.

681
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,191
Then we should have a whole bottle.

682
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,873
Game on, man.

683
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,991
Well, what's next, a frat party at SC?

684
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,159
No, I...

685
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,231
...just wanted to celebrate.

686
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,709
Listen, I expect you
to take this job seriously.

687
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,957
I'm not gonna be out drinking
with you every night after work.

688
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,679
Weekends, maybe.

689
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,038
And tonight.

690
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,079
Game on, Matt.

691
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,759
Game on, boss.

692
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,358
Hi, Seth.

693
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,468
Hi.

694
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,196
- Are you okay?
- I'm trapped in the gym with everybody...

695
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,715
...but my only two friends
in the school, so...

696
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,589
...other than this being my worst
nightmare ever, yeah, I'm okay.

697
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:21,196
So I just wanted
to say thank you, for before.

698
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,710
- I really appreciate it.
- Yeah, it's no problem.

699
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,836
After 12 years I'm immune
to mockery, so...

700
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,995
And about the sign-in sheet,
we could work something out.

701
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,514
- You mean it?
- Sure.

702
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,157
So do you mind
if I join you for some pizza?

703
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,918
No. Go ahead.

704
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,075
Thanks.

705
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,311
I guess Ryan's gonna miss the lock-in.

706
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,155
It's better he stayed with Johnny.
It'll keep him from going after Volchok.

707
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,112
At this rate, we both might miss it.

708
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,396
- Wait here, okay?
- Okay.

709
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,396
Can anyone hear me?

710
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,989
- Who is it?
- Taylor, it's Summer! Open up!

711
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,993
Taylor!

712
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,514
Taylor?

713
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,558
Sorry. I can't hear you.

714
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,228
What do you mean, you can't...?
You're responding! Taylor!

715
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,317
- Sorry.
- What?

716
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,630
What? Taylor!

717
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,754
And I'll take a cheeseburger. Extra fries.

718
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,319
Okay.

719
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,559
Dinner's on me, man.
I'm really sorry about the fight.

720
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,473
Although I gotta say, watching Volchok
get his ass kicked was pretty awesome.

721
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,999
Glad I could be of service.

722
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,430
Hey, man, where'd you learn
how to fight like that?

723
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,433
You know, Chino's
pretty good training ground.

724
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,509
Actually, I never won a fight
till I got to Newport.

725
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,677
Cohen is gonna kill me.

726
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,150
I'm sorry, I feel like it's my fault
you missed the lock-in.

727
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,629
Actually, I kind of feel like
everything's my fault.

728
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,756
What, you mean Johnny and Casey?

729
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,480
- Not what I was referring to, thanks.
- I'm sorry, Coop.

730
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,790
It's obvious, though.
She saw him falling for you.

731
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,520
She hurt him before he hurt her.
It's a classic girl move.

732
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,989
- I know what everyone thinks, but...
- He likes you.

733
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,913
And sooner or later,
you're gonna have to deal with it.

734
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,872
I really wish everything
would just slow down.

735
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,189
Well...

736
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,991
No such luck.

737
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,396
Yeah, Coop, this shouldn't
be a problem for you at all.

738
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,351
