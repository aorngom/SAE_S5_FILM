1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,673
<i>- Previously on</i> The <i>O.C.:</i>
- Oh, my God. Kaitlin Cooper?

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,598
So how long have you been in love
with my sister?

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,313
I don't have feelings for Johnny.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,033
- Last one in!
- Kaitlin!

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,639
- I could go for a drink.
- You read my mind.

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,831
Actually, I was hoping you might
have dinner with me sometime.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,035
Neil, I would love to.

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,515
You disrespected me,
and the company I'm trying to build.

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,314
That guy from Brown, he didn't say they
couldn't take more than one student.

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,550
- Well, this might be the year.
- That's right.

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,674
Hey, baby, have you seen
my lucky tie?

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,876
I got it dry-cleaned.

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,312
- You're an angel.
- Big day?

14
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,910
Well, I gotta sign some papers,
make a few calls, build a hospital.

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,269
Building a hospital, wow.

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,790
Well, Caleb deserves most of the credit.
I just inherited the project.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,117
- So who's paying for it?
- Newport Laguna Medical Center board.

18
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,272
They commissioned a proposal from us
and from a firm in Brea.

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,759
Today we're both presenting.

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,748
- And they're gonna pick you.
- Well, now that I got my lucky tie.

21
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,110
- Hey.
- Hello. Hi.

22
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,955
Are you okay? You seemed
a little distracted last night.

23
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,156
Yeah. No, I'm fine.

24
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,157
I don't think that convinced anyone.

25
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,873
I was leaving school yesterday...

26
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,033
...and Mrs. Rushfield said some Brown rep
called and wants to interview me Sunday.

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,949
That's great.
Why didn't you say anything?

28
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,913
I don't know.
I guess it just needed to sink in.

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,399
Did Summer get her interview?

30
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,079
I forgot to ask, actually.
I was just kind of spinning.

31
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,999
You want me to help you out?
Maybe ask you a few questions?

32
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,559
Yeah.

33
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,837
Matt's waiting for me right now,
but when I get back, let's talk.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,197
- We'll practice whatever you need.
- Yeah.

35
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,879
- Gotta go.
- Oh, I better go too.

36
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,871
Julie and I have a meeting
with a client.

37
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,998
- I am so proud of you.
- Thanks.

38
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,152
Sure you're all right, man?

39
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,719
Yeah, it's just kind of weird.

40
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,911
There I am, and I'm all ready to go...

41
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,196
...and I got my watch set
to East Coast time...

42
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,669
...then I get this interview
and it kind of hit me.

43
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,718
- Like, I'm leaving Newport.
- So you're having second thoughts.

44
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,390
Dude, I planned my first escape
on an Etch A Sketch. This is my dream.

45
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,755
It's just... I don't know, now it's real.

46
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,872
Why don't you talk to Summer.
I'm sure she's freaking out too.

47
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,310
No, I'm fine.
Seriously, this is just my process.

48
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,837
Fair enough.
You're pouring coffee in your cereal.

49
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,194
Newport, I hardly knew you.

50
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,034
- Cohen! I got one.
- Hey, Summer.

51
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,471
An interview with the Brown guy.
Rushfield told me. You got one too.

52
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,874
Oh, yeah, that's great.

53
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,555
Great? Mrs. Rushfield said they only
interview people they're serious about.

54
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,359
This totally increases our chances
of getting in together.

55
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,353
- Show some excitement.
- No, it's amazing, it's just...

56
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,432
- Are you feeling any anxiety about this?
- About what?

57
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,269
Leaving Newport, your friends and family,
and going somewhere new in September?

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,275
- Yeah, honestly, I was.
- Really? Because...

59
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,959
- Then I talked to Colonel Flint.
- Who?

60
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,031
My boot-camp instructor.
He's a former Delta.

61
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,714
He says you can either ride change
or change rides you.

62
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,190
Also, there's no room in the
trenches of life for whiny little babies.

63
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,356
- Wanna see my war face?
- It's not necessary.

64
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,069
I gotta go. But it's not September.
Freshman orientation starts August 25th.

65
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,556
- Bye.
- Bye.

66
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,239
Situated as it is, the hospital
will provide ready access...

67
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,995
...to Newport's affluent and less affluent
neighborhoods, the whole community.

68
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,720
More detailed budgets and schedules
are in your folders.

69
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,996
Along with copies
of the permits we've pulled.

70
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,957
We know you have
another proposal to hear.

71
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,588
You should know
we're ready to start any time.

72
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,398
Just give us the green light.

73
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,511
Well, you two have done a great job.

74
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,439
- I only wish Caleb could've been here.
- Thanks, Bill.

75
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,871
This project was close to his heart.
He did have one, as it turns out.

76
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,951
We'll contact you
when we've made our decision.

77
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,717
Now we wait.

78
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,553
What?

79
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,634
I took a look at Brea Group's plan
this morning.

80
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,519
I didn't wanna tell you
because I didn't wanna spook you.

81
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,319
- So?
- It's good.

82
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,551
- Better than ours?
- They're both excellent.

83
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,394
But the Brea Group...

84
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,711
...has been wining and dining Bill
Merriam and the board for months.

85
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,668
- I mean, dinner, concerts, cruises.
- We offered bagels when they came.

86
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,030
I'm worried that we've
handicapped ourselves.

87
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,596
I said I wouldn't do business
by plying people with meals and gifts.

88
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,711
And I respect that. I do.

89
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,912
But what it could all come down to
is who Bill Merriam likes more.

90
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,916
Well, hopefully he'll appreciate the fact
that we appealed to his intelligence...

91
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,230
...and not to his taste for pinot.

92
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,996
Here's a picture with Kaitlin.

93
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,236
But what's wrong with this horse?

94
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,351
That's China. She has alopecia.

95
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,832
She looks like a giant Chihuahua.

96
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,393
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

97
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,552
Kaitlin turns 15 this weekend,
and I'm putting together an album.

98
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,159
Oh, that's nice of you.

99
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,990
She hasn't been home for one since she
was 12, so I've got a few to make up for.

100
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,875
As long as it comes with diamond
earrings, I'm sure Kaitlin will be happy.

101
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,390
My parents went overboard on
Kaitlin's birthdays when she was little.

102
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,391
It always made Summer
a little jealous.

103
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,792
I need a coffee. Anyone else?

104
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,952
- What is it?
- It's just, looking at these old photos...

105
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,476
I mean, is this really the same girl
who stole money from a fraternity...

106
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,796
...and then lied
about paying for an abortion?

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,991
I feel like I don't
even know her anymore.

108
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,112
Families can be like that.
People change on you.

109
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,796
This is your chance
to know the new Kaitlin.

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,558
I guess.

111
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,188
I mean, otherwise,
she goes back to school...

112
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,033
...and I have to go to college,
and that's it.

113
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,159
Cirque du Soleil?

114
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,673
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

115
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,638
Most people I know just had a clown
at their birthday party.

116
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,512
My mom went all out.

117
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,478
We had presents, games,
a petting zoo.

118
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,478
And honestly, the best part
was always the afterparty.

119
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,153
My whole family together.

120
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,593
We'd stay up late and eat cake
and watch <i>The Sound of Music.</i>

121
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,591
Sing along.

122
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,751
Oh, you mean like:

123
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,276
- <i>"I am 16 going on 17"?</i>
- Yeah.

124
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,716
Except, however old I was turning,
we'd always put in the ages.

125
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,276
I guess as long as we still do that,
the rest doesn't really matter.

126
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,068
So have you told Marissa
that we're hanging out?

127
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,439
No.

128
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,716
You're not gonna tell her, are you?

129
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,632
Not much chance of that.

130
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,839
Now that she's at Harbor... I haven't
talked to her since your mom's party.

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,230
You mean since we had
our midnight swim?

132
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,314
You mean since you had your swim
and I got you a towel.

133
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,954
Most guys would have
taken advantage of me.

134
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,999
Yeah, I guess I'm old-fashioned.

135
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,511
That's what I like about you.

136
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,396
Now, let's talk about what you're
gonna get me for my birthday.

137
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,349
Julie.

138
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,432
I am so sorry to keep you waiting.
A procedure ran long.

139
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,033
Oh, no, no, it's fine, Neil.

140
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,795
It's just... I have to pick up Marissa
from school in a few minutes.

141
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,678
Oh, no.

142
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,435
Well, let's enjoy the time that we have.
I'm just happy we're finally meeting.

143
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,550
After you postponed twice, I thought
maybe you'd changed your mind.

144
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,515
No, I just kept thinking about the fact
that our daughters are best friends...

145
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,150
...I'm a recent widow,
you're just out of a marriage.

146
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,319
So, what finally tipped the scale?

147
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,715
I felt something.

148
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,349
Me too.

149
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,590
- I'm so sorry. I really have to go.
- Oh, no, no. I got this.

150
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,753
How about dinner Sunday night?

151
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,639
I know this terrible burger joint.
Even the owner avoids it.

152
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,835
We'll be totally alone.

153
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,193
Sunday then.

154
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,112
Hey.

155
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,480
- I came to see how you're doing.
- Hey, Dad.

156
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,632
It's amazing to think that
you'll be leaving in a few months.

157
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,233
Yeah, and I'm freaking out.

158
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,876
For years, I've been talking about
how much I wanna get out of here...

159
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,635
...and then as soon as it's time,
I'm all like, "No. No, I'm not ready."

160
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,395
No, what you're feeling
is totally natural. I felt it.

161
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,599
Leaving the Bronx for California...

162
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,352
I was terrified about fitting in.

163
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,878
I spent a month
practicing how to say "dude."

164
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,268
You still say it kind of...

165
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,749
Look, you're about to begin
this great adventure...

166
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,797
...and you have no idea
what's gonna happen.

167
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,911
I just don't feel like it's the beginning.

168
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,071
I feel like things are coming to an end.

169
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,117
I'm sorry. It's the hospital board.

170
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,753
Bill. How you doing?

171
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,839
I'm gonna go take a walk.

172
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,918
Good idea. Clear your head.
I'll talk to you when you get back.

173
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,354
I'm sorry.

174
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,193
So are we building a hospital?

175
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,199
Hey, Kaitlin.

176
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,197
Anyone home?
Me and Mom got takeout.

177
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,114
Hey, sweetie. Did Marissa tell you?
We got Thai takeout.

178
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,713
We're doing dinner à la Cohen.

179
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,269
- That sounds great. I love Thai.
- Oh, you know what?

180
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,558
I got a menu from an Armenian place.
You can order from there Sunday night.

181
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,757
I have a business dinner.
It's totally annoying.

182
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,672
- Sunday?
- Mom?

183
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,154
We've got plans Sunday.

184
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,515
What are you talking about?
We don't have plans.

185
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,717
We do. We were gonna order in
food, watch <i>The Sound of Music.</i>

186
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,797
<i>The Sound of Music?</i> Why would...?

187
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,037
Oh, my God, baby. I totally forgot.
Sunday's your birthday.

188
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,919
But if it's business,
you can totally reschedule, right?

189
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,873
- I can totally reschedule.
- You know what, why bother?

190
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,832
- Kaitlin.
- No, seriously.

191
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,792
I hardly even remembered, myself.

192
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,912
I'm gonna go meet a friend
because I'm not even hungry.

193
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,752
Kaitlin, wait.

194
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,353
Oh, Sandy, you wanna tell the boys
that dinner's almost ready?

195
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,432
Sure, but Seth's taking a walk.
He'll be back soon.

196
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,951
- What's wrong?
- Oh, Bill Merriam called.

197
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,838
They're going with the group in Brea.

198
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,473
Oh, I'm sorry.

199
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,108
- I just really wanted this project.
- Is it too late for a new approach?

200
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,548
No, we took our shot.

201
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,474
I don't want a contract if we have to get
it by plying some guy with Kobe beef.

202
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,559
If that's what you think would convince
him, I think you're selling yourself short.

203
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,832
- What do you mean?
- I just know that when you wooed me...

204
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,152
...there was no caviar and champagne
and you did all right.

205
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,070
I should take Bill Merriam out for pizza
and bad wine in the back of a mail truck.

206
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,869
I mean, show him who you are
beyond schedules and budgets.

207
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,038
And who knows?
Maybe he loves pizza.

208
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,909
Hey.

209
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,272
Kaitlin?

210
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,398
What are you doing here?

211
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,158
Are you...?

212
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,676
- Are you smoking pot?
- Yeah, why? You a cop?

213
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,633
No, but l... You know, I mean...

214
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,389
Relax. Nobody here's gonna bust me.

215
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,548
- You want some?
- No, I'm okay. I'm good, thanks.

216
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,793
You sure? It helps take the edge off,
and I could tell you could use it.

217
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,673
Yeah, well, I was saving
the whole drug thing for college.

218
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,914
Plus, my dad smoked pot at Berkeley,
so it's pretty much ruined for me.

219
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,152
- Where'd you get that?
- School. This girl grows it in her closet.

220
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,352
- What made you decide to...?
- My mom forgot my birthday.

221
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,313
Yeah. That whole time that
I was gone, I kept telling myself that:

222
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,631
"You're paranoid.
They're not gonna forget about you."

223
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,358
Wrong.

224
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,717
Well, you know what?
I'm sure your mom feels really bad.

225
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,751
But that's not the point.

226
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,835
Can you imagine growing up with
Marissa Cooper as your older sister?

227
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:59,476
My birthday was the one day I could
count on being noticed. Not anymore.

228
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,353
Kaitlin.

229
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,471
- Please don't say anything.
- Yeah.

230
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,188
- Hey.
- Hey.

231
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,153
We just bumped into each other.
Two ships passing.

232
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,032
Come on, please,
can we go home now?

233
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,998
Mom feels terrible.

234
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,108
Fine.

235
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,676
Well, I'll see you.

236
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,150
Offer stands.
You know where to find me.

237
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,115
Kaitlin, your phone.

238
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,358
Johnny?

239
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,232
Oh, Marissa, hey.

240
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,590
Hey. Were... Are you calling Kaitlin?

241
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,998
No, I was calling you...

242
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,558
...but your phone didn't ring,
so I figured I'd give hers a try.

243
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,114
What are you doing?

244
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,311
Hey, it's Johnny. It's for me.

245
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,109
What's up?

246
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,788
It seemed like we
hadn't talked for a while.

247
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,276
I know. What are you doing tonight?
Because we were all gonna go out.

248
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,190
Oh, thanks, but I'm
gonna be with a friend.

249
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,112
Hey, listen, my mom needs me.
Let me call you later?

250
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,595
Okay. Bye.

251
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,236
So anytime a guy calls, it's for you?

252
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,792
What are you talking about?
I mean, it was for me.

253
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,038
Forget it.

254
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,114
Kaitlin, I know you're upset
about last night, but...

255
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,710
- And I'm bored talking about it.
- Okay, well...

256
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,913
...we're going out tonight
to the Bait Shop if you wanna come.

257
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,238
I can't. I'm meeting friends.

258
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,028
I'm gonna go take a shower.

259
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,509
Hello?

260
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,712
So how do you feel about
going to the Bait Shop tonight?

261
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,235
- Julie. What a surprise. Come in.
- Hi, Neil.

262
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,628
Is Summer here?

263
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,313
No, I think she's at Seth's.

264
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,072
Okay, well, is there any chance...

265
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,118
...that we could have dinner tonight
instead of tomorrow night?

266
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,352
Unfortunately, I'm working.
You're not gonna cancel on me, are you?

267
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,239
Tomorrow's Kaitlin's birthday.
I can't believe it slipped my mind.

268
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,358
I'd like to give her a small party.

269
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,909
I guess it'd have to be small.
I live in a trailer.

270
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,115
I hope you understand.

271
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,512
- Why don't you have it here.
- What?

272
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,188
There's plenty of room.
Girls can use the pool.

273
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,510
And I get to see you.
What do you say?

274
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,393
- I say...
- Wonderful.

275
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,914
Here's a key.

276
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,355
You can let yourself in,
do all the prep you need.

277
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,717
I've got a couple of minutes.
Why don't I give you a tour. Come on.

278
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,472
All right, Summer,
this one's for you. Ready?

279
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,959
- Yeah, I'm listening.
- Okay.

280
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,192
Who's been the greatest influence
in your intellectual development?

281
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,509
Miuccia Prada.

282
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,438
You probably wanna say
somebody more like Einstein or...

283
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,278
- So you want me to lie?
- No, I just...

284
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,910
I don't think that Prada
is the answer that they're looking for.

285
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,157
Well, this interview could determine
the rest of our lives, right?

286
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,710
If I say something I don't believe in,
I could end up with the wrong life.

287
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,074
How awful would that be?

288
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,679
She has a point.

289
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,553
- I have to go get a mani-pedi.
- Summer.

290
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,834
Cohen, if you wanna memorize answers
you think they wanna hear, that's fine.

291
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,399
But I believe in being myself.

292
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,593
By the way, Miuccia Prada
combined styles from time periods...

293
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,354
...in ways people never
even imagined possible.

294
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,080
Her clothes teach you
to change your perspective.

295
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,475
I think she'll be fine.

296
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,872
- Where do you see yourself in 10 years?
- Where do I see myself in 10 years?

297
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,712
That's a good question. Okay.

298
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,716
More than anything,
you know what I would like?

299
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,110
I would like the happiness
that I have right now.

300
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,475
Although, I guess,
what are the chances of that?

301
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,359
You go through life,
and you'll only be able to look back...

302
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,308
...and pinpoint like two or three times
where you were genuinely happy...

303
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,349
...and in those moments you wouldn't
have appreciated it. Who does, right?

304
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,398
So where do I see myself in 10 years?

305
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,757
I guess, what I would like is...

306
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,832
I'd like to be right here, you know?
Right now, in this moment.

307
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,310
And not because I'm afraid
of uncertainty, because I'm not.

308
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,792
It's just, you know, I was taught
that when you have something good...

309
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,918
...what you're supposed to do
is you hang on to it, you know?

310
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,275
You hang on to it with both hands.

311
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,273
If somebody tries to take that
from you, what you should do...

312
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,796
...is you should make sure that they
pry it from your cold, dead fingers.

313
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,393
Yeah.

314
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,720
- Let's take a break.
- Oh, God.

315
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,279
I'll get you some water.

316
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,276
Hey, I told you to stop
coming in on Saturdays.

317
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,634
Look who's talking.

318
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,598
Listen, give Bill Merriam a call...

319
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,228
...and tell him we'd like
to take him out tomorrow.

320
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,148
This is a good idea.

321
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,153
I know they haven't given Brea
the word. So, what should I do?

322
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,197
Set up a tee time?
Reservation at The Arches?

323
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,231
- You ever eaten at El Pavo Loco?
- No.

324
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,470
- That a new restaurant?
- It's a burrito stand.

325
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,868
We'll take him on a tour...

326
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,679
...of neighborhoods around the hospital.
- You're kidding.

327
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,400
The Brea Group's hospital
is smack in an exclusive area.

328
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,879
Ours would serve more people.

329
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,632
- I wanna bring that home.
- Sandy...

330
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,519
I know it's not how
the rest of the world does business.

331
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,758
Okay.

332
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,679
I'll tell Bill Merriam that he'll
have a day he'll never forget.

333
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,995
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

334
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,758
How's it going with Kaitlin?

335
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,070
Well, I mean, she was pretty upset.
I invited her out...

336
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,717
Kaitlin?

337
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,595
Oh, my God, Marissa. I totally
forgot you were gonna be here.

338
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,792
Okay, well, what are you two doing?

339
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,238
We're just hanging out.
So don't freak out or anything.

340
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,436
Yeah, we probably
should've mentioned it.

341
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,915
So you two are just hanging out?

342
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,509
Well, yeah. He took me home
from the party, remember?

343
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,353
Then we had a chance to talk.
Went for a swim.

344
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,279
- Actually...
- I asked you to drive my sister home...

345
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,750
...and you went for a midnight swim?
- No, look, I just got her a towel.

346
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,718
Who were you really calling
this morning, me or her?

347
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,511
I knew she was
gonna freak out like this.

348
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,428
I'm not freaking out.
I just don't like being lied to.

349
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,079
Whatever.

350
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,830
Can you take me home?
I don't feel very well.

351
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,118
I'm sorry.

352
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,234
You all right?

353
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,472
Yeah, I just... I don't see why
they couldn't tell me the truth.

354
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,877
Come on. Watching
Marissa get jealous?

355
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,314
Admit it felt good.

356
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,799
She wasn't jealous.

357
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,712
She was so jealous.

358
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,991
Seeing us together.

359
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,636
- Kaitlin, I'm not sure about this.
- But I thought you liked me.

360
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,636
I do, but...

361
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,074
Okay, look, even if
you weren't Marissa's sister...

362
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,633
...I'm 17, you're 14.

363
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,990
- Fifteen tomorrow.
- Still.

364
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,557
Fine. I get it.

365
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,631
No, look...

366
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,717
...I wanna keep hanging out.

367
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,475
But as friends, okay?

368
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,073
It will make Marissa mad.

369
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,709
I can live with that.

370
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,950
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

371
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,550
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
I know it seems weird...

372
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,078
...me loitering in the shadows.

373
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,032
It's okay.

374
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,155
I had a feeling you'd come around.

375
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,793
- Hey. Top of the morning.
- Hey.

376
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,188
So today's the day, huh?

377
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,516
Yeah. Interview's
not till this afternoon.

378
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,029
Well, your mother's making pancakes.
Come on down.

379
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,073
I already ate. Plus, I just wanna
go over some of this stuff.

380
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,919
At a certain point, cramming
becomes counterproductive.

381
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,798
Do something to relax.

382
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,393
I was thinking that myself.

383
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,079
You're gonna do great.

384
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,155
Happy birthday.

385
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,311
Look, Kaitlin, I know you think
I overreacted or whatever...

386
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,712
...but Johnny's just a lot older than you.
I don't wanna see you get hurt.

387
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,713
Oh, please.
Like that's really why you got mad.

388
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,876
What's that supposed to mean?

389
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,278
Hey.

390
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,712
Look at that.

391
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,396
My two little girls. Or should
I say, two young women?

392
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,754
Happy birthday, sweetie.

393
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,237
Oh, gross, Mom. You're all sweaty.

394
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,311
I know, I'm sorry. I was running.

395
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,833
After years of doing Cardio Barre and
yogalates, I forgot how good this feels.

396
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,911
- I got three honks.
- That's great, Mom.

397
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,998
Okay, so tonight, not only
have I planned an amazing dinner...

398
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,913
...but Dr. Roberts said that
we could have it at his house.

399
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,752
Dr. Roberts offered you his house?

400
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,757
Yeah, well, I ran into him yesterday...

401
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,480
...and I mentioned it was
Kaitlin's birthday, and voilà.

402
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,596
He couldn't take no for an answer.

403
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,797
He's so generous. Whoever
gets him is a very lucky woman.

404
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,991
You know, I don't want
a birthday dinner.

405
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,549
What are you talking about?
He said we could watch...

406
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,234
<i>...The Sound of Music</i> on his plasma.
- Maybe next year.

407
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,951
Oh, honey, I am so sorry
that I forgot your birthday.

408
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,835
Ever since Caleb's death,
things have been a little crazy.

409
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,391
But we really need this as a family.

410
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,709
Please?

411
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,190
- Only if I can invite a friend.
- No.

412
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,589
Isn't it better if it's just family
and the Roberts?

413
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,833
Well, it's Kaitlin's birthday.
She can have whoever she wants.

414
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,639
Maybe we should invite your friends
from the equestrian club.

415
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,195
Sure. Sounds great.

416
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,595
- Bye.
- Okay. Bye, honey.

417
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,390
Marissa, I'm gonna need you
to help me set up.

418
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,156
Please? I need to make
this up to Kaitlin.

419
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,632
- Fine.
- Okay, thanks.

420
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,400
Oh, sorry about the sweat.

421
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,870
<i>I am 16 going on 17...</i>

422
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,392
Knock, knock.

423
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,073
Hey.

424
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,033
You and Marissa.
It's like the perfect couple.

425
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,994
You know, people used to say that
about her and Luke.

426
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,999
- Life's weird, huh?
- Yeah.

427
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,072
- What's up?
- I need your advice.

428
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,430
My mom's throwing a party
for me tonight.

429
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,113
Of course you're invited.

430
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,272
But do you think that Marissa
would mind if I invited Johnny?

431
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,476
No, why would she mind?

432
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,791
Well, she seemed a little weird
when she saw us together last night.

433
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,188
But they're just friends...

434
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,352
...so why would it matter if we
hang out, if they're just friends?

435
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,552
Kaitlin, what are you trying to do?

436
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,796
Just make everybody happy.
I told you.

437
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,030
Because it seems like
you're mad at Marissa...

438
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,231
...and you're looking
for a way to hurt her.

439
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,395
What are you talking about?
Marissa's my sister, and I love her.

440
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,195
Then why don't you talk to her
instead of trying to stir something up?

441
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,951
You know, I'm sorry
that you feel that way.

442
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,588
But Johnny's my friend,
and I want him at my party.

443
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,069
It's just... That look on her face
when she saw us...

444
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,748
But I don't have to
tell you about that, do I?

445
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,234
See you tonight.

446
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,871
Thank you so much for your help, Kiki.

447
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,600
God knows I have my talents.
Cooking is not one of them.

448
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,910
It was nice of Neil
to lend you his house.

449
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,913
- Yes, he is a gentleman.
- Is he?

450
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,275
Kirsten, please.

451
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,908
We've hardly had a real date.
We haven't even kissed.

452
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,150
But he offered his house
for Kaitlin's birthday.

453
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,788
- I'd say that's a good sign.
- It is a beautiful house.

454
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,794
I think he could change the marble
in the entrance hall, and the furniture...

455
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,748
Julie, since you haven't kissed yet, you
might wanna hold off on redecorating.

456
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,159
Oh, yeah, just making conversation.

457
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,998
- Should I take this out?
- Yeah, please.

458
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,715
Great. Thank you.

459
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,997
Here you go.
Newport's finest churro.

460
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,152
Thanks, Sandy. I don't remember
the last time I walked this much.

461
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,312
Well, the hospital would service
a wide variety of neighborhoods.

462
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,199
- I wanted you to get a sense of that.
- Mission accomplished.

463
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,430
I told you how the
free clinic might operate?

464
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,434
Twice. But if you don't mind, I think
I need a little break from the hospital.

465
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,630
All right. We're losing him.

466
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,394
- Let's do it your way.
- Yeah, you sure?

467
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,319
The truth is, the tour worked
more on me than it did on him.

468
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,711
I'm not gonna rob this community
of something it needs just...

469
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,518
Just so I can sleep easier.

470
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,874
So come on.

471
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,189
Bill.

472
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,396
It's dinnertime.
Where would you like to go?

473
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,798
Marissa, you should come in.
The water's great.

474
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,236
Yeah, I'd love to,
but I'm helping set up for your party.

475
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,510
And I'm so grateful.

476
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,630
Marissa, Kaitlin, look who's here.

477
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,756
- Hi, Dr. Roberts.
- Hey, Marissa.

478
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,670
Kaitlin, don't you think you should say
thank you for Dr. Roberts' hospitality?

479
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,668
Thank you for letting me
use your house for my party.

480
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,389
You are so welcome.

481
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,790
Johnny! You came.

482
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,833
My little girl is growing up.

483
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,793
Yeah, and she wants everyone
to see it too.

484
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,030
- Mom, this is Johnny.
- Of course.

485
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,111
This is Dr. Roberts. This is his house.

486
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,555
- Hey, Johnny.
- Nice to meet you.

487
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,153
- Hey, Marissa.
- Hi.

488
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,993
Oh, look, I got you all wet. I'm sorry.

489
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,835
I'm gonna go see
if Kirsten needs help.

490
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,436
- Seth? Hey, man.
- Yes?

491
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,999
Yes.

492
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,390
Jeez, man, I'm co...

493
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,028
- Something's blocking the door.
- Okay.

494
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,191
Just calm down.

495
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,476
"I gotta get in right now."

496
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,234
I'm coming. I got...

497
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,716
Do something real f...

498
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,996
Yeah, that's perfect.

499
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,956
- What's that?
- Okay.

500
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,316
God. Listen, hey, man, I'm sorry.

501
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,756
There's a laundry buildup right there.

502
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,512
Jeez.

503
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,274
It's almost 3:30.
Isn't your interview at 4?

504
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,715
What are you talking about?

505
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,712
Hey, how did that happen?

506
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,950
- Well, are you ready?
- Am I ready?

507
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,272
Do me a favor.
Go ahead and feel that.

508
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,000
- Feel that puppy right there.
- No, I don't wanna feel...

509
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,152
You don't wanna touch
another man. I get it, I get it.

510
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,437
You find my slender
swimmer's body intimidating.

511
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,959
- Something smells.
- It doesn't.

512
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,436
No, it doesn't,
but they say the first sign...

513
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,513
...of a brain tumor is phantom smells,
so you should lie down.

514
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,240
Hey, hey.

515
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,670
You solved it.
You figured it out. That's...

516
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,513
You're a mystery-solver.
You're like Encyclopedia Brown.

517
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,076
Remember? When Encyclopedia Brown,
he went on down to Texas...

518
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,957
...to solve the mystery
of the great shootout.

519
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,516
Hey, how about this for a change?
How about in a cage match...

520
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:19,435
...Encyclopedia Brown versus
The Great Brain.

521
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,158
To the death.

522
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,277
Are you high?

523
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,158
Am I high?

524
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,995
No. No. Come on, man.
I love when you go for the comedy.

525
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:38,711
But I would not quit your day job
beating up people.

526
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,753
I wouldn't.

527
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,398
I don't know how that got there.

528
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,832
- Hello?
- Hey, Summer.

529
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,356
- Are you at the interview yet?
- Yeah, I'm about to go in.

530
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,074
Can you stretch yours out a bit?
Seth's gonna be late.

531
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,869
Sure. What happened?

532
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,753
I need to bring him down to earth.
We'll be there soon, okay?

533
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,394
Okay. Bye.

534
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,912
Seth? Hey, man.

535
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,150
Got some coffee.
I want you to drink it, okay?

536
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,072
Dude, I am not stoned anymore.

537
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,834
Okay. Then why are you
in my shower?

538
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,155
- How did that happen?
- Just drink the coffee.

539
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,796
Dude, all right, I'm fine. The guy's gonna
think I'm Rupert the Monkey Boy.

540
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,552
How long you been doing this, man?

541
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,632
It's pot. Aren't you
overreacting a little bit?

542
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,149
You were doing it alone, in secret.
It's different.

543
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,833
This is the first time, I swear.

544
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,270
And this is really
just stress about leaving?

545
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,318
Two years ago, this miracle
happened to me, okay?

546
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,677
You showed up and Summer started
talking to me, and my life changed.

547
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,151
I'd be leaving that
for someplace new...

548
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,917
...and it'd be really easy for things
to go back to the way they were.

549
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,709
It wasn't a miracle. You got up on that
coffee cart and told her you loved her.

550
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,314
You've changed. You're gonna
be fine wherever you go.

551
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,871
Now, tell me you weren't stupid enough
to buy the pot down at the pier.

552
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,359
Half those guys are narcs.

553
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,676
No, it was nothing like that.

554
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,549
Don't get her in trouble with Marissa,
but, actually, I got it from Kaitlin.

555
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,914
Thank God.

556
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,674
Do you realize I've been in there
for an hour and a half?

557
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,990
- What took you so long?
- He needed to calm down.

558
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,118
Why don't you head on in and meet us
at Summer's when you're done.

559
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,429
- Yeah.
- Okay.

560
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,474
No pressure. But if you mess it up,
our future together is ruined.

561
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,789
- Hey.
- People I know. Hi.

562
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,599
After Kirsten left,
I had no one to talk to.

563
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,559
This is a good turnout, though.

564
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,234
Yeah, well, my mom
invited Kaitlin's old riding club.

565
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,913
Probably shouldn't have bothered.

566
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,274
Summer.

567
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,873
- Excuse me. Okay, guys?
- Yeah.

568
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,108
- Sweetheart, how'd your interview go?
- It went great.

569
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,713
Everything all right?

570
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,829
Yeah, well, remember when I said
I wanted to get to know Kaitlin?

571
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,111
Be careful what you wish for.

572
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,077
In that case, there's something
I should tell you about her and Seth.

573
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,995
What are we doing here?

574
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,720
I told you. Looking for my presents.

575
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,677
Your presents are all downstairs.

576
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,233
Not all of them.

577
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,392
- Kaitlin, look, I told you...
- That you're 17 and that I'm 14.

578
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,433
But I'm not 14 anymore, remember?

579
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,557
- But someone could come in, we should...
- You wanna lock the door?

580
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,993
- What are you planning on doing to me?
- Very funny.

581
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,151
Or is it you're afraid
Marissa will come in?

582
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,075
She sees you with her little sister,
and then you really don't have a chance.

583
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,596
- What are you talking about?
- Look, you said that you liked me.

584
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,512
Now we're only two years apart.

585
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,477
So unless there's something else...

586
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,078
- I'm not interested in Marissa, all right?
- Then prove it.

587
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,390
One birthday kiss.

588
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,749
You know, I think we better
get back to the party.

589
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,240
You can't stop me.
I've let this go far enough as it is.

590
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,676
I know you need to talk to her, but
it's your sister and her birthday party.

591
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,393
Hey, I'm back.

592
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,956
From my interview for Brown,
which I went to.

593
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,679
Okay.

594
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,237
You told her, didn't you?
Okay, first of all, don't blame Kaitlin.

595
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,839
Fat chance of that.

596
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,549
- Where have you been?
- Oh, Johnny gave me my present.

597
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,077
So you're in charge of everything?

598
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,196
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

599
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,909
So it looks like Lily and Bill
are hitting it off.

600
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,116
Yeah, I balked at taking him
out to dinner...

601
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,829
...but I'm totally cool about turning
your apartment into the Playboy Grotto.

602
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,518
- Bill. Here you go.
- Thanks, Sandy.

603
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,591
Dry martini for you, Lily.

604
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,673
- Gotta tell you, glad I didn't go home.
- So am I.

605
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,316
This may not seem fair, but I'm gonna
talk to you more about the hospital.

606
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,789
Sandy, that won't be necessary.

607
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,514
Excuse me, please.

608
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,030
- I'm in.
- You're in?

609
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,953
Honestly, I didn't see the
difference between the proposals.

610
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,476
You're trying to take care of me.
The least I can do is take care of you.

611
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,631
I mean, that's business, right?

612
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,196
Caleb would've been proud.

613
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,679
A martini. And Scotch
for the young lady.

614
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,476
- So, what did he say?
- We got the hospital.

615
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,668
- Really?
- Really.

616
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,035
Sandy, that's amazing.

617
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,632
So where do we go
to have fun around here?

618
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,189
Where are you going?

619
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,992
Leaving. Would you tell Mom?

620
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,476
You're leaving
your own birthday party?

621
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,638
I need to talk to my sister.

622
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,190
- Listen, Marissa...
- I don't feel like hearing it right now.

623
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,749
- What's wrong with you?
- Here we go.

624
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,555
Kaitlin, you gave Seth pot.
You stole money from a fraternity.

625
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,832
- I don't know who you are anymore.
- Spare me the concerned-sister bit.

626
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,389
We both know this is about Johnny.

627
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,110
- You don't know.
- Anyone can tell you like him.

628
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,430
You don't think Ryan can?

629
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,756
- I love Ryan.
- Yeah, you love Ryan.

630
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,794
You guys are soul mates. Blah, blah, blah.
It doesn't mean you don't like Johnny.

631
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,076
- I don't.
- Really?

632
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,676
Well, then you wouldn't mind
that I just made out with him upstairs.

633
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,959
Yeah.

634
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,669
You may not know me,
but I do know you.

635
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,437
- Hi, there you are. You all right?
- No. It's Kaitlin.

636
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,637
Hey, Marissa, honey, where's Kaitlin?
It's time for the cake.

637
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,711
- She's gone.
- What?

638
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,953
What do you mean? She's not gone.
She wouldn't just leave her own party.

639
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,878
Yeah, well, we got into a fight.

640
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,069
You got in a fight at her
birthday party? What about?

641
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,713
I don't wanna go into it, okay?

642
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,950
How could you do this
to your little sister?

643
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,873
Do you know what she's been through,
being away for so long?

644
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,554
This was a very important birthday
for her, for us.

645
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,554
Look, Mom, no offense, but I don't think
a party's really gonna fix this family.

646
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,478
Excuse me?

647
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,194
You know, I should just go, okay?
I'm sorry. Bye, Dr. Roberts.

648
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,356
- I'll take you home.
- No.

649
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,318
I wanna walk. I need the fresh air.

650
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,589
- I don't know what to say, Neil.
- It's fine, Julie. It's fine.

651
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,352
- You know, I just wonder...
- Oh, no.

652
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,354
No, I think you were right to be cautious.
We both have very complex lives...

653
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,910
...and maybe we should consider
all the implications before going further.

654
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,278
Sorry, it's my nurse. They said
they'd beep me if I was needed.

655
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,750
- I hate to leave you like this.
- Oh, no, it's fine.

656
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,674
I'll just give these kids some cake
and send them home and...

657
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,115
You're right about the other thing.
I agree.

658
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,637
So we'll talk.

659
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:01,392
And you can leave the key
on the dish when you leave, all right?

660
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,752
Come in.

661
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,070
Hey, Cohen. I'm looking to see if
Brown has a course in Human Sexuality.

662
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,959
Because, no offense,
you are so taking that.

663
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,832
Summer.

664
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,555
Oh, my God, I'm such an airhead.
How did it go?

665
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,438
Please tell me it went okay. Please?

666
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,198
It went great.

667
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,470
- We totally bonded.
- Oh, that is amazing.

668
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,632
This means we're gonna
be together next year.

669
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,229
- Come here, let's pick out our schedule.
- Okay.

670
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,033
- Where's the rest of it?
- Oh, I threw away the boring courses.

671
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,112
You know, like, history, English,
health, science.

672
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,872
That was probably a good idea.

673
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,793
Oh, hey. When did you get home?

674
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,632
Just a few minutes ago.

675
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,279
I thought you might be sleeping.

676
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,476
No, I waited up. How did it go?

677
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,910
Well, we made our case...

678
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,949
...and we got it.

679
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,478
Sandy, that's wonderful.
And you did it your way.

680
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,834
Yeah.

681
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,592
- When are you coming to bed?
- Soon.

682
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,399
Bill Merriam's coming by tomorrow.
I should prep a little.

683
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,839
Well, I'm very proud of you.

684
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,231
