1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,079
Previously on The O. C. :

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,869
There' re sparks between her and Carter.
I was thinking we could set them up.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,837
How did Summer take the fact
that Reed's a woman?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,433
I couldn't tell her even if I wanted to.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,318
I'm working with him
on his comic book.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,118
Getting rid of Caleb,
I'll do it.

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,872
-I said I'd help you.
-I'll pay you back.

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,996
Some girl took drugs.
She passed out in the pool.

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,513
I gave them to her.
I brought the drugs.

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,557
-Hungry?
-No.

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,193
Me, neither.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,556
Dude, you cannot blame yourself,
all right?

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,359
All you did was give Trey a chance,
and you believed in him.

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,069
And it's like, look, whatever he did
at Marissa's party, that's all on him.

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,753
The thing is, I don't think he did.

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,230
I mean, Trey's a lot of things,
but I just don't think he's a drug dealer.

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,154
So when cops asked, "Who's responsible
for the girl floating in the pool? "...

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,437
...he was like, what, "I'm an ex-con
on parole. I know, I'll say me. "

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,068
I think when the cops went to put
the cuffs on Marissa...

20
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,878
...he did that to stop them.

21
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,112
-What makes you say that?
-I was about to do the same thing.

22
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,753
Yeah. Sure.

23
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,911
The compulsive need
to rescue Marissa Cooper.

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,072
-lt must be in the Atwood DNA.
-lt would explain a lot.

25
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,516
The good news is, if he really didn't
do it, then my dad will get him off.

26
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,473
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure about that.

27
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,437
I thought you'd be mad at me.

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,272
Why would I be mad?

29
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,078
I mean...

30
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,198
-...you didn't do it, right?
-No, man. No way.

31
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,636
It's just when I saw them about to take
Marissa, I had to do something.

32
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,679
If gallantry and/or stupidity were
defenses to felony-dealing charges...

33
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,955
...you'd be a free man.

34
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,509
Hey, why don't you go get settled
in the pool house.

35
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,635
Wait, you're staying with us again?

36
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,439
I am in Sandy's custody.

37
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,070
It's the only way he could get the judge
not to lock me up.

38
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,391
-You couldn't get him off?
-Well, you know the old expression:

39
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,312
"No good deed goes unpunished. "

40
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,754
Trey's facing hard time.

41
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,589
I'm gonna go make some calls.

42
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,312
-I gotta do something.
-Okay.

43
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,948
But the buddy-cop thing,
I mean, that's just a metaphor.

44
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,031
We're not actually
supposed to solve crimes.

45
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,713
He's my brother, I gotta help him.

46
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,394
If that means finding the person
that's responsible....

47
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,755
Going undercover
in a high school sting operation?

48
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,992
That would be very
21 Jump Street of you.

49
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,596
-Whatever it takes.
-Yeah. Okay.

50
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,876
I get to be Richard Grieco.

51
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,912
-How'd it go with Trey?
-Well, he 's out of jail for the time being.

52
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,914
By court order, he'll be at the Cohen
halfway house until next week's hearing.

53
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,358
-That is, as long as it's okay with you.
-l' m guessing that he's there already.

54
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,080
-Back in the pool house.
-Is he okay?

55
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,117
Well, all things considered.

56
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,397
Well, I guess I'll tell Carter that
we can't go to Santa Barbara then.

57
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,394
Gee, I totally forgot about that. The
winetasting weekend at Featherbrook.

58
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,597
-You go. I'll stay with Trey.
-No, no. That's no big deal.

59
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,558
I mean, Carter can handle
the vineyard story by himself.

60
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,235
I don't think he's going by himself. He
told me he was thinking of asking Erin.

61
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,717
-Erin? Really.
-Yeah, yeah.

62
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,872
When I mentioned that you were
bringing me along for the weekend...

63
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,156
...he thought it'd be fun
to go as a foursome.

64
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,198
Well, then, all the more reason for me
to stay home with you.

65
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,511
I certainly wouldn't wanna be
a third wheel.

66
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,232
Do you want a coffee?

67
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,839
Honey, are you there?

68
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,076
Yeah. I'll see you at home.

69
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,600
Hurry up, sweetie.
You're gonna be late for school.

70
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,238
-That's it?
-Well, yeah. It's almost 8:00.

71
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,869
I don't get it.

72
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,715
You trust me to have a few people for
a birthday party, it turns into a rager...

73
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,348
...someone nearly drowns,
and I don't even get punished?

74
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,557
Well, you know, it's not your fault.
These things can happen.

75
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,871
Plus, if I punished you, I'd have
to tell Caleb about it, wouldn't it?

76
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,600
-Oh, so he's finally coming home.
-Yes. Tonight.

77
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,593
And I'm planning a special
welcome-home celebration for him.

78
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,755
Don't worry, it's a party for two.

79
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,670
-Gross.
-Personal sacrifices I make...

80
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,116
...to keep a roof over our heads
are nobody's business but my own.

81
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,679
Okay, really gross.

82
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,790
All I'm asking is that we not mention any
lesbian dalliances or bodies in the pool.

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,117
I should stay with Summer tonight.
That way you won't worry about me...

84
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,998
...slipping up with Caleb.

85
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,549
And you can make all the personal
sacrifices you want.

86
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,793
Hi.

87
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,712
-Where's Cohen?
-Wouldn't know.

88
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,030
-I'm avoiding him.
-Because of the Reed thing?

89
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,714
He deliberately led me to believe
that she was a he.

90
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,919
She, who happens to be cute and
obsessed with his precious comic book.

91
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,718
-Graphic novel.
-Whatever.

92
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,031
-He's a subdolous egomaniac.
-Subdolous?

93
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,111
It's from my word-of-the-day calendar.

94
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,078
It means sneaky and underhanded,
not to be trusted.

95
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,513
Your ears must've been burning.
Too bad they're not on fire.

96
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,636
Just wait a second.

97
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,994
This is for you.

98
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,196
I keep the rest in a vase at my house.

99
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,079
Every morning, I take one out,
and I bring it to school...

100
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,834
...just hoping that I run into you,
so I can apologize.

101
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,113
That's actually kind of sweet.

102
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,033
And to sweeten the mea culpa
even a little bit further...

103
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,760
...guess who got you a ticket
to Death Cab tonight?

104
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,593
Hey, didn't you check your e-mail?

105
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,955
Reed read your first draft
of Atomic County.

106
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,235
-And?
-She loved it.

107
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,549
-Okay.
-Well, good.

108
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,632
That means that this
graphic-book thing's finally over?

109
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,552
Not exactly. She has notes.

110
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,032
-You said she loved it.
-She does.

111
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,751
Note-giving is just the publisher's way of
showing creative investment in a project.

112
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,354
She wanted to do it earlier,
but we had school...

113
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,590
...so we're doing it later at her place.

114
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,913
No. There's....

115
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,833
There's Death Cab. And I have,
you know, Summer and Death Cab.

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,151
-So....
-Seth, you can't blow this off.

117
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,515
She's been working
around our schedule already.

118
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,233
Well.... Okay, can we
meet up after, I guess?

119
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,278
-I hear they play long sets.
-Whatever, Mr. Subdolous.

120
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,231
-Mr. Subdolous?
-New villain.

121
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,072
You should pitch it to Reed tonight.

122
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,312
See you, buddy.

123
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,429
Trey should've let me get arrested.
It'd be a lot easier for Sandy to help me.

124
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,593
Yeah, well, thinking before speaking,
not exactly Trey's strong suit.

125
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,194
So, what can we do?

126
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,875
We can find out who brought the drugs
to your party. You got any ideas?

127
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,279
-Kyle Thompson.
-That guy? I've never seen him before.

128
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,954
Yeah, well, he's a senior
and a water polo player.

129
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,395
So you guys don't exactly run
in the same circles.

130
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,678
-Everyone says he's the guy to go to.
-Looks like "Floater Girl" knows him.

131
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,239
Who, Jess Sathers?

132
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,631
I didn't know she was at my party
until she nearly drowned in the pool.

133
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,268
-So you know her?
-Used to.

134
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,997
Could you talk to her, find out if Kyle's
the one who hooked her up?

135
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,037
Yeah, I can try.

136
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,273
-Hey, Jess.
-Hey.

137
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,478
-ls everything okay?
-Y eah. Just....

138
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,712
I invited Erin up to the winetasting
in Santa Barbara this weekend.

139
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,633
After a week of not hearing from her,
she leaves a message saying...

140
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,912
...she doesn't think it's a good idea
to start seeing each other.

141
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,957
-Did she say why?
-No. Nothing.

142
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,592
-I'm sorry.
-Well, me too.

143
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,115
I thought we hit it off
at your dinner party.

144
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,158
I even rented a '65 Mustang
for the drive up there.

145
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,958
You and Sandy wanna carpool?

146
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,190
You'll have to cover the piece
without me.

147
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,590
-You're kidding. What happened?
-Family emergency.

148
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,877
Ryan's brother needs Sandy's help,
so he'll be working all weekend.

149
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,759
What about you?
You can't peel away for an afternoon?

150
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,071
Did I mention the vintage convertible?
It's red.

151
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,151
-I wish I could.
-I'm sorry.

152
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,595
I just hate drinking alone.

153
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,752
Well, I hate drinking wine alone.

154
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,353
Me too.

155
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,676
Well, I will make sure to pick up
a bottle of Featherbrook's finest.

156
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,230
And I owe you guys a supper,
so maybe we'll do that next week.

157
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,516
Terrific. Have a great weekend.

158
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,272
You too.

159
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,477
Jess, hey.

160
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,310
I just wanted to say how totally sorry
I am for what happened at my party.

161
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,550
-That was your house?
-Yeah.

162
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,073
-You okay?
-Yeah.

163
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,231
You know, just another war story.

164
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,073
-Yeah, I got a few of those.
-Right.

165
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,549
I heard about your little incident
in TJ last year.

166
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,032
Not my finest moment.
My parents were all over me after that.

167
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,752
In fact, I don't really know
anyone anymore, and....

168
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,593
Well, I was kind of wondering
if maybe you could hook me up.

169
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,354
A chance to party with the legendary
Marissa Cooper?

170
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,750
-You going to Death Cab tonight?
-Yeah, totally.

171
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,230
Look for me. I might know someone.

172
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,672
How'd it go?

173
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,193
I think it's on.

174
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,834
I think you're right.

175
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,637
Pick any restaurant you want.
Sort of a welcome-home dinner.

176
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,318
They're all Thai menus.

177
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,357
We didn't do a lot of Thai food
growing up.

178
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,798
Somewhere in our heritage, a Cohen
bagged himself some Asian action.

179
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,190
-Seth.
-You can't go wrong with pad Thai.

180
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,476
In fact, actually, save some for me.
I gotta go.

181
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,473
-Where you going?
-An inconvenient note session...

182
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,791
...in Silverlake. Ryan, delay Death Cab
as long as you can.

183
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,633
Also, give one of those flowers
to Summer for me please.

184
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,313
-What?
-You guys going out tonight?

185
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,994
Yeah. But if you wanna hang out
when I get back--

186
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,913
I'm the one under house arrest.
You don't gotta babysit me.

187
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,150
-Hey, gang.
-Hi.

188
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,436
-Did you talk to the prosecutor?
-Not yet.

189
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,194
But I found out who it's gonna be,
guy named Tom MacGinty.

190
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,679
-You know him?
-I know of him.

191
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,559
He's a big lrish conservative.
A real letter-of-the-law type.

192
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,154
He's got about eight kids,
six are daughters.

193
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,594
Maybe that's a good thing.

194
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,876
If he's a family man,
maybe he's sympathetic.

195
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,508
-Risk a drug dealer near his daughters?
-I'm not a dealer.

196
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,557
Oh, I know that. But he doesn't.

197
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,517
-So you're saying I'm screwed.
-No.

198
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,911
What I'm saying is we're gonna have
to start on your defense tonight.

199
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,708
Thanks for making the drive.

200
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,078
-I'm sure traffic out of Newport's a bitch.
-No, the drive was no problem.

201
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,515
We're just looking forward
to hearing your thoughts.

202
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,911
-Yeah. As quickly as possible, please.
-Let's get started then.

203
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,870
Okay. Overall, we're concerned about
the universality of Atomic County.

204
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,474
We' re a little worried
kids in the heartland...

205
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,108
-...they' re not gonna get this world.
-Okay.

206
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,838
Sure, sure.

207
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,272
Except I know that, for me...

208
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,671
...Atomic's location was always sort of
the backbone of the comic strip.

209
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,116
I mean, that's why I thought you guys
were interested in the first place.

210
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,794
-We'll take a look at it.
-Okay. Okay, okay.

211
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,269
Also, we're wondering about Cosmo Girl.

212
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,839
Her magic flask?

213
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,709
Could she get her power from, like,
a sports drink instead?

214
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,679
Because Legal's worried about lawsuits
from the parents of teen alcoholics.

215
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,478
Oh, the lronist.

216
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,714
Oh, boy, a little cerebral.

217
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,314
Is he being ironic?

218
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,115
Oh, I gotta take this. Y eah, go.

219
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,713
-Who is that guy?
-Oh, Damon's a marketing genius.

220
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,953
We recruited him out of Fantagraphics.
He's gonna make you very, very famous.

221
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,032
As what,
the worst comic book author ever?

222
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,556
He is really good at what he does.
And the party tomorrow night is his idea.

223
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,235
-What party?
-A party. That is awesome of you.

224
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,914
He thought it would be good
to introduce you to everyone.

225
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,675
Get you with directors, musicians,
animators for off-shoot projects.

226
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,197
-Okay, that's great, but we're kind of--
-So there. Thank you.

227
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,035
Bring your girlfriend. Everyone's
dying to meet Little Miss Vixen.

228
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,158
-Right. Little Miss Vixen's a character--
-I'll be right back.

229
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,956
Yeah. Summer's gonna kill me.
I say we walk right now.

230
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,997
No. We've come too far to blow this.

231
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,594
Even if those were good ideas,
which they're not...

232
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,194
...that re-write would take me a year.
I can't do that.

233
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,716
-Summer and I would be over by then.
-That's why you bring her to the party.

234
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,189
Make her a part of the process.
Include her in this.

235
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,432
-You really think that's a good idea?
-Definitely.

236
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,953
Will you tell me again about
Marissa's party? Who'd you talk to?

237
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,995
Besides Ryan's friends?

238
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,151
I don't know, a couple girls.

239
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,231
The girl in the pool?

240
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,356
Maybe.

241
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,354
Well, the police report has an eyewitness
claiming that she saw you and Jess...

242
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,876
...enter a room and close the door.

243
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,751
Okay. Look, Jess and l,
we hit it off a little.

244
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,753
You know, talked and stuff, but....

245
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,591
Truth is, I thought we were gonna
go back to my place and hook up.

246
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,793
Next thing I know, the cops have arrived
and she was face down in a pool.

247
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,518
Did you see Jess take any drugs?

248
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,713
No. But it was-- It was clear
she was on them.

249
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,437
-Where'd she get them?
-There was this one guy...

250
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,272
...I heard he was passing out pills.

251
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,513
-You think you might recognize him?
-I don't know.

252
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,240
You know, he looked like
every other kid in this town.

253
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,359
Tall, tan, and a face you just wanna...

254
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,159
-...flatten.
-Do any of these names ring a bell?

255
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,596
Maybe she mentioned somebody
or said something about somebody?

256
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,668
No.

257
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,752
No. Look, I just wanted
to help Marissa out.

258
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,708
Okay? Nobody's ever thrown me
a birthday party.

259
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,235
I wasn't gonna let her go to jail for it.

260
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,074
I can't believe Seth is missing
his favorite band.

261
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,800
It's one thing blowing me off,
but blowing off Death Cab?

262
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,793
This comic book has totally broken him.

263
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,678
-You seen Jess yet?
-Jess?

264
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,912
Jess Sathers?
Why you looking for that coke whore?

265
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,710
What? She is.

266
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,390
Marissa Cooper, are you doing coke?

267
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,312
What? No.

268
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,671
-No, we're--
-We're helping Trey.

269
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,193
Helping him what, score?

270
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,511
-Stay out of prison. I'm gonna do a lap.
-lf you see her, let me know.

271
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,874
Or Kyle.

272
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,871
Or Seth.

273
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,393
Julie?

274
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,909
I'm up here.

275
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,911
Would you come down here, please?

276
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,640
Why don't you come up here?

277
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,315
Welcome home, sailor.

278
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,475
-What's all this?
-What does it look like?

279
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,712
It looks like one of your movies.

280
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,595
That's not funny.

281
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,671
Not supposed to be.

282
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:55,033
I spent the last few weeks
trying to get past...

283
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,952
...the incident.

284
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,473
Turns out I can't.

285
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,672
I've missed you.

286
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,957
After all this time,
I was hoping maybe you missed me too?

287
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,429
Cancel whatever spa treatment
you booked tomorrow.

288
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,637
-We need to have a serious discussion.
-About what?

289
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,315
I have a meeting with my lawyers
in the morning. We'll talk after that.

290
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,631
Lawyers?

291
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,438
What exactly are you saying?

292
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,473
I'll let my attorney talk for me.

293
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,272
I mean, where other than the Bait Shop
are tickets always plentiful...

294
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,510
...and the band never too loud
to talk over?

295
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,352
Cohen is missing it.

296
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,351
Hello?

297
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,074
Here comes your girl.

298
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,797
-Oh, no, I'm blanking. Say something.
-What?

299
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,110
Oh, my God, Jess! Hi.

300
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,872
Remember me? Summer Roberts.

301
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,077
We had tap and jazz together
in fourth grade. Shuffle-ball-change.

302
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,470
-Right.
-Don't mind my friend.

303
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,949
She's really, really stoned.

304
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,269
Totally. Very, very high.

305
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,874
Isn't this place, like, so visual?

306
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,113
-So do you wanna go sit down?
-Can't. Looking for a friend.

307
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,430
The kind who could hook me up?

308
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,991
Actually, he lost his stash last weekend.

309
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,799
But he's taking orders for
tomorrow night. You want in?

310
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,871
-Definitely.
-Water Polo's throwing a party.

311
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,634
We can meet up there.
Here's the address. Cash only.

312
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,153
No problem.

313
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,878
How about you?

314
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,076
Oh, no. Strictly ganja.

315
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,471
Yeah, what's from the earth
is of the greatest worth.

316
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,957
-I'm gonna kill you.
-I hope you know what you're doing.

317
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,954
How is he?

318
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,712
Oh, he's scared. He's frustrated.

319
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,030
It turns out Trey knew
the girl in the pool.

320
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,997
Police have an eyewitness to confirm it.

321
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,116
-That's not good.
-None of it is.

322
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,432
I gotta keep this from a trial, but there's
no way that prosecutor will cut a deal.

323
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,477
That's because he only knows Trey
on paper.

324
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,593
Oh, honey...

325
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,954
...you're a genius.

326
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,829
-I am?
-Yeah, a genius.

327
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,479
What are you working on?

328
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,232
Notes for the winetasting article.

329
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,039
Something to keep Carter focused
after his seventh pinot...

330
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,236
...since he will be
attending unchaperoned.

331
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,231
What happened with Erin?

332
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,356
It didn't work out.

333
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,876
That's too bad.
I thought those two were a match.

334
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,156
Honey, this is gorgeous.

335
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,430
You should go up there with Carter.

336
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,079
I should be here.

337
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,869
Well, there's nothing you can do
for Trey. He knows you're behind him.

338
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,589
I guess if we leave early enough,
we could be back in time for dinner.

339
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,069
I'll make the dinner, you bring the wine.

340
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,036
Man, it's packed in here tonight.

341
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,751
Oh, hey. Don't I know you?

342
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,478
From that house party last weekend?

343
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,156
-I don't think so.
-Kyle, right?

344
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,436
Man, that party was out of control.

345
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,353
I heard some chick almost OD'd
in the pool.

346
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,598
-ls that right?
-Yeah.

347
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,189
Good night, O.C.!

348
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,155
I cannot believe I missed Death Cab.
Just kill me.

349
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,118
Shoot me in the face.
Speaking of which, is Summer around?

350
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,592
I need your help.
I have a little quagmire to un-quag.

351
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,072
What?

352
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,309
Oh, is that the guy? Is that--?
Hey, are you on a bust right now?

353
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,799
Holy-- Dude, what can I do?

354
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,912
-Just give me a job--
-Stay out of it.

355
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,878
I wanna help. Really sorry about that.

356
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,869
Well, they're not that way,
that's the ocean, so....

357
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,751
There he is.

358
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,148
So what do we say?

359
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,118
You say nothing. You stay right here.

360
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,953
Big Mac.

361
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,512
-T om MacGinty.
-Sandy Cohen.

362
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,355
Sandy Cohen?
Why do I know that name?

363
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,149
I've been trying to get in touch the last
several days through the DA's office.

364
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,390
I represent Trey Atwood.

365
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,914
-What is this, an ambush?
-No. No, no, no.

366
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,709
-Just hoping we can put together a deal.
-The kid was caught dealing on parole.

367
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,916
-You know something I don't?
-Yeah.

368
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,593
You got the wrong guy.

369
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,799
We got his confession. We got witnesses
placing him with the girl who OD'd...

370
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,758
...and ecstasy matching her tox screen
recovered at the scene.

371
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,150
-Check it for fingerprints.
-Trey.

372
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,118
I never touched it,
so my fingerprints won't be on it.

373
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,396
You're right. No one's are.

374
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,632
And who'd know that,
except the guy who wiped the bag clean.

375
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,756
Not another word, Trey.

376
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,117
Two years probation.
Plus 1 00 hours of community service.

377
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,431
That kid is looking at least a year
for the parole violation alone.

378
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,875
None of those other kids
even have a traffic ticket.

379
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,033
So unless you've got another suspect
for me, there's not gonna be a deal.

380
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,754
Except for my hair issues,
great call on the convertible.

381
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,753
Well, that's the way the California coast
was meant to be seen.

382
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,798
And your hair looks great.

383
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,555
Liar. For your punishment,
I control the radio on the way home.

384
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,838
No. No one who has won
on American Idol ever sings in my car.

385
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,709
Consider yourself lucky. If it was Sandy,
you'd listen to torch songs, show tunes.

386
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,472
Preferable.

387
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,314
Members of the press, honored guests...

388
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,755
...I'd like to welcome you
to my family's winery.

389
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,071
Unfortunately, my grandfather,
Chief Featherbrook, is in poor health...

390
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,310
...and will be unable to join us
this afternoon.

391
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,153
That's a shame. I was hoping
to get a glimpse of the old guy.

392
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,118
I think he's a marketing gimmick,
like the Jolly Green Giant.

393
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,555
Hey, maybe we can turn this article
into an exposé.

394
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,996
--mountain range running east to west,
rather than north to south.

395
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,550
My grandfather's convinced it's what
gives the grape its unique flavor.

396
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,073
Hail to the chief.

397
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,640
I can't believe your big apology dinner
has turned...

398
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,314
...into a make-me-even-madder party
in Silver-Hell.

399
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,473
You know, if a cab ride home didn't
cost $300, I would so be out of here.

400
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,632
Listen, I understand that you're here
on false pretenses.

401
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,679
I was sort of hoping once we got here
you would try and make the best of it.

402
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,435
-Hey, guys. Come in.
-Hey.

403
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,550
Everyone, the man of the hour
has arrived.

404
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,870
Allow me to introduce
to you the architect...

405
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,873
...and illustrator
of Atomic County, Seth Cohen.

406
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,237
-His creative partner, Zach.
-Nice to meet you.

407
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,755
And, of course,
Little Miss Vixen, herself.

408
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,592
-Dude.
-Hey.

409
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,354
Joe Sacco's in the kitchen right now.
He wants to meet you.

410
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,636
Of The Fixer?

411
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,429
No. I don't know, what do you say to
somebody like that? The guy's a legend.

412
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,036
And he's a big fan of yours,
and he's about to leave, so....

413
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,511
Just go.

414
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,673
-You wanna go get a drink?
-Yes.

415
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,830
I lost track of time.
You guys ready for dinner?

416
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,831
Actually, we need to talk to you.

417
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,389
-Sure.
-Wait, wait.

418
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,958
No matter what happens...

419
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,395
...I just wanna thank you
for the work you've done.

420
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,235
Nobody's ever gone out on a limb
like this for me.

421
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,957
Time and time again. I'll never forget it.

422
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,156
You're talking like
we're already defeated.

423
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:25,438
Look, I'll admit there's a lot of work
to be done, but it ain't over till it's over.

424
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,114
All due respect, I was there too.

425
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,508
I know I'm going down.

426
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,392
Oh, look...

427
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,069
...I know things look bad.
But now is not the time to give up.

428
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,151
No, we're not. We....

429
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,469
We know who the dealer is.

430
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,676
-Who?
-A guy at school.

431
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,558
-Well, we're gonna need proof.
-I think we can get it. Tonight.

432
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,959
Can we talk? I just need a drink.

433
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,156
I got whiskey.

434
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,272
Make yourself at home.

435
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,355
So Caleb's been behind closed doors
all day with his lawyers.

436
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,273
As of tonight, it's over for me.

437
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,311
Me and my girls are out on the street
with nothing.

438
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,593
-No prenup?
-A porn scandal more than nullifies it.

439
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:26,677
Caleb's old. His health is not good.
I know a guy that can get some pills.

440
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,316
I can switch his medicine while you're
out of town. No one will suspect.

441
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,756
Then you can live the life you deserve.

442
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:37,232
And never worry about anybody
taking that away from you ever again.

443
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,118
You're serious, aren't you?

444
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,793
As a heart attack.

445
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,073
What are you doing?

446
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,310
I'm writing you a check.

447
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,391
You don't gotta pay me
to kill your husband.

448
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,632
It's not for that.
It's to get you out of town.

449
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,034
I'm not a murderer, neither are you.

450
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,594
I never should have come.

451
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,712
Well, good luck, babe.

452
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,959
Goodbye, Lance.

453
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,873
You know...

454
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,316
...they should implement
the bucket concept in fast-food chains.

455
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,391
All the flavor, none of the calories.

456
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,197
You're sick.

457
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,318
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you so much for coming.

458
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,391
We look forward to your reviews.

459
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,231
How many wines have we tasted?

460
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,470
According to my notes...

461
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,151
...I stopped taking notes.

462
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,914
Well, should we fire ourselves
for drinking on the job?

463
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,513
Drinking was the job.

464
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,195
And I did my job really well,
because I'm hammered.

465
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,271
You can't be, you have to drive.

466
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,478
I'm not driving. Are you kidding?

467
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,871
With the cliffs and the oceans
and the winding roads?

468
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,598
No way. You drive.

469
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,716
Oh, no, no. I can't drive.

470
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,998
I have had as much to drink as you have,
and I'm half the size--

471
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,152
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Point well taken. Yeah.

472
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,756
Excuse me. Yes, it's okay.
It'll be all right.

473
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,559
Could you possibly find a driver
for us tonight?

474
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,951
We failed to make proper use
of the silver bucket.

475
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,317
-Are you staying locally?
-No. Orange County, actually.

476
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,959
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Y eah.

477
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,271
But I could offer you a guest suite
if you'd like to stay here tonight.

478
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,430
What do you think?
Should we expense it?

479
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,352
I guess we don't have a choice.

480
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,395
-Whose list are you on?
-Jess'. Marissa Cooper.

481
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,194
-You on Jess' list too?
-No.

482
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,678
Then you can't come in. Sorry, dog.

483
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,995
Meet me around the side of the house.

484
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,074
This really is the dark side.
Any sign of Kyle?

485
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,117
No. But he probably shouldn't
see you here.

486
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,752
Come on.

487
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,316
Hey, Marissa!

488
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,436
-Oh, my God, you came.
-Hey, Jess.

489
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,275
-You look so beautiful tonight.
-Thanks. You're in a good mood.

490
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,476
-Candy flipping.
-Candy flipping?

491
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,918
Yeah, ecstasy and mushrooms.
Good for the body and the mind.

492
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,034
-Sounds perfect.
-Come with me, girly-girl.

493
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,758
Where have you been?
We had plans to talk.

494
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,357
I'm here now. Let's talk.

495
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:02,479
Are you sure you don't want to shower
or something?

496
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,037
You may not believe this...

497
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,675
...but I put everything I had
into this marriage.

498
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,956
I wanted it to work
just as much as you did.

499
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,348
Oh, I doubt that.

500
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,237
No one hates to fail more than I do.
But here we are.

501
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,628
Just say it Caleb.

502
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,710
You want a divorce.

503
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,470
These real tears?

504
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,638
No one's more surprised than me.

505
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,472
All right, then...

506
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,148
-...I'll give it one more chance.
-What?

507
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,834
Standing here,
I realize I still have feelings for you.

508
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,630
I owe it to both of us to explore that.

509
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,317
I don't know what to say.

510
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,436
"Thank you," I suppose.

511
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,869
Put on something nice.
I'll take you to dinner.

512
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,912
-It's ruined. I'm sorry.
-Oh, that's okay.

513
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,231
Should we drink to its demise?

514
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,868
Defeats the purpose of sobering up,
doesn't it?

515
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,838
Yeah. But there's a minibar.

516
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,638
I should call Sandy.

517
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,194
Yeah.

518
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,035
And I should take a shower.
I smell like a fermented grape.

519
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,075
I have a confession.
I was gonna take off tonight.

520
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,268
Get out of town, never look back.

521
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,796
Well, legal problems of this nature
have a way of resurfacing.

522
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,076
The only way to deal with them
is head on.

523
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,754
-Yeah, that's what Ryan said.
-He's a smart kid.

524
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,799
-Yeah. You all right?
-I'm sorry I didn't call earlier.

525
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,872
-I couldn't get a signal.
-That's okay. You guys on the road?

526
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:15,749
Neither of us are actually in the
right shape to drive just yet, so....

527
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,639
A little too much lndian spirit, huh?

528
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,438
Well, drive back in the morning.

529
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,910
-Are you sure?
-Y eah. I mean, it's not worth dying over.

530
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,277
I don't want either of you behind
the wheel if you've been drinking.

531
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,991
I love you.

532
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,116
You know, I gotta tell you something.

533
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,669
I don't know many men who'd let their
wife spend the night with another guy...

534
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,114
...no less suggest it.

535
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,909
How many men you know
been married for 20 years?

536
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,279
-I'm sorry to disturb you.
-Oh, you're not. It's fine.

537
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,874
I was able to locate a car
if you still needed one.

538
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,314
That's....

539
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,948
-Can I call you?
-Certainly. The number's on the back...

540
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,315
-...if you'd like to call directly.
-Thank you.

541
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,390
You know, I just think that
the cross-promotional opportunities...

542
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,039
...for Atomic County are endless.

543
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,237
We're talking fast food tie-ins,
action figures, NASCAR.

544
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,436
-NASCAR?
-Kids are into body sprays these days.

545
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,431
A different scent for each character.

546
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,512
It's never too early to start developing
multi-media franchises.

547
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,636
Right. What do you mean?

548
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,394
Atomic County online. Video games.

549
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,437
-My own video game?
-This time next year...

550
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,592
...why not Atomic County TV show?

551
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,833
-That's not so bad.
-Seth.

552
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,228
-I need to talk.
-One second.

553
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,198
Do you think--? Are you talking about
animation or live action?

554
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,713
Why not a hybrid?

555
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,879
-Why not a hybrid?
-Seth.

556
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,190
-One second.
-You did not just give me the finger.

557
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,510
-I didn't give you "the" finger.
-Look...

558
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,558
-...Seth, I want to go home now.
-Why? Are you not having fun?

559
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,597
No, I'm not. These people are annoying.

560
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,558
They think they are so smart
and cool with their messy hair...

561
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,995
...and their dirty clothes
that they bought that way.

562
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:19,119
They play their retro board games,
and they drink wine for fun.

563
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,999
I'd like to make a toast.

564
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,357
T o Seth and his subversive vision,
and those that inspire it...

565
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,557
-...the Little Miss Vixens of the world.
-God save us all.

566
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,233
-Here, here.
-It's fun. It's fun. It's a good time.

567
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,389
Cheers.

568
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,913
I don't see why you're so mad.

569
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,117
You didn't make any effort.
They asked you to join the conver--

570
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,510
Hey, Zach, can I have a ride home?

571
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,511
-Yeah, sure.
-Thank you.

572
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,557
Zach, what are you doing?

573
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,390
Goodbye, Cohen.

574
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,312
-Seth, we need you.
-Summer--

575
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,111
Come on in,
we're playing board games.

576
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,918
-I smell a tie-in.
-No, stop.

577
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,832
Right? You follow me?

578
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,956
-Let's go, everybody.
-What are we playing?

579
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,236
We're going to the boardroom.

580
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,598
Nothing like five-star water pressure.

581
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,592
-You okay?
-Yeah, I just-- It's a little-- It's the wine.

582
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:22,349
There's a "hers" bathrobe
and some fuzzy slippers in the closet.

583
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,796
You wanna take a shower?

584
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,756
Carter...

585
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,471
...they found a car for us.

586
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,038
Well, that's a good thing, right?

587
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,997
I need to go home.

588
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,593
Yeah. Okay.

589
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,150
I'll go get dressed.

590
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,078
What's happening?

591
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,595
They're outside, talking.

592
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,272
Open your hand.

593
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,351
One at a time. And drink tons of water.

594
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,520
Oh, and stay away from the GHB
on this. Trust me.

595
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,874
It's 80, right?

596
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,759
Kyle thinks you're cute.
He only wants 60 and an introduction.

597
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,753
Come on.

598
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,999
Ryan?

599
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,357
Reinforcements are on their way.
You be careful.

600
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,351
-What did he say?
-We're on.

601
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,558
Hey, look. I just wanted to thank you
for hooking me up.

602
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,634
-But I kind of have a boyfriend, so....
-I kind of don't care.

603
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,593
Back off, man, she's with me.

604
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,355
You need to get out of here, bitch.
This is a private party.

605
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,318
Hope you enjoyed it.
It's probably gonna be your last.

606
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,272
-Go back inside.
-You're a narc?

607
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,675
Don't move. Stay where you are.

608
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,188
-This the kid you saw last week?
-Yeah, it's him.

609
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,958
-You all right?
-Getting used to it.

610
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:09,720
-You're under arrest for possession....
-Whose is that? That's not mine.

611
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,474
He planted it on me! That kid's a liar!

612
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,312
You have the right to an attorney.

613
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,630
If you cannot afford one,
one will be provided.

614
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,429
I'll file a motion
to dismiss charges on Monday.

615
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,353
-Thanks for doing this, T om.
-Thanks for ambushing me.

616
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,357
You ready to go home?
It's past my bedtime.

617
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,592
Actually, I was kind of hoping
to spend the night at my place tonight.

618
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,034
We can drop you off.

619
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,799
Mr. Cohen.

620
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,637
All right.

621
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,830
-Thanks, little brother.
-No, Marissa's the one...

622
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,151
-...who deserves the credit for this.
-Let's just call it even.

623
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,511
So....

624
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,910
Been a while since....

625
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,589
-Since we were--
-Alone?

626
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,275
-Yeah. Without, you know, something--
-Or someone.

627
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,069
-Guess we can do whatever we want.
-Well, what do you wanna do?

628
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,392
Wait, wait.

629
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,357
We've waited a really long time for this.

630
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,592
-Do you wanna stop?
-No, I just....

631
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:00,114
I think we can do better
than the front seat of Sandy's car.

632
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,556
I know a guy
who has a pool house all to himself.

633
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,553
You think he'd let us borrow it?

634
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,591
Oh, yeah.

635
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,554
What are you doing here?

636
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,837
-I think you have some idea.
-Yeah, breaking and entering.

637
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,356
How do you know
I'm not working for the cops?

638
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,158
I asked around.

639
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,876
-You really are just out of jail.
-And I'm not looking to go back.

640
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,635
So you took the fall for Marissa Cooper
and then did what you had to do.

641
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,758
The only thing I can't figure out
is why you didn't turn me in.

642
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,753
Well, the cops are only looking
for one suspect.

643
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,514
And I figured you had
a rough enough week as it was.

644
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,158
And besides...

645
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,597
...I like talking to you.

646
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,911
Yeah? Well, I like talking to you too.

647
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,559
And now with Kyle out of the picture,
I think we have a lot more to talk about.

648
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,719
You interested?

649
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,075
I'm definitely interested.
