1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,518
- <i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>
- I can't do this anymore. I don't trust you.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,908
Oliver's not stable. He's dangerous.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,674
Oliver has not done anything to Marissa
except be her friend.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,149
Look, you guys may not believe me.
No one may believe me.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,435
- Theresa.
- Ryan Atwood.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,591
- So you two were...
- We grew up together.

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,078
I always had a crush on you.

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,069
You should go.

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,708
I'm not gonna stand here and pretend
like I'm your girlfriend when I'm not.

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,909
At least not anymore.

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,310
Put the gun down,
you get a second chance.

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,519
- I'm sorry. You were right.
- It's okay. It's okay.

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,557
Happy Valentine's Day.
Someone just got struck by cupid's arrow.

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,196
Happy Valentine's Day.

15
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,438
- Valentine's Day's not till tomorrow.
- You're not excited?

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,718
I am. I am. I'm just still thinking
about Oliver with that gun.

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,836
- I know.
- Who knows what could've happened?

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,514
But it didn't.
And Dr. Kim lifted Ryan's suspension.

19
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,433
So the best thing is for
everything to return to normal.

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,637
And in this house that means
celebrating the holidays.

21
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,837
Valentine's Day is not a holiday.
Rosh Hashanah, that's a holiday.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,549
Memorial Day? Yes, a holiday.
You know who invented Valentine's Day?

23
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,631
- St. Valentine.
- Hershey's and Hallmark.

24
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,392
If you're single, it depresses you.

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,199
If you are in love, start shelling out.
Chocolate. Flowers.

26
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,157
- Lingerie.
- You never bought me lingerie.

27
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,276
See how upset you are?
I hate this holiday.

28
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,000
- Must be talking about Valentine's Day.
- I am. I hate it.

29
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,956
- Hey. You got me.
- Guess who got shot by cupid's arrow.

30
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,348
Is someone going overboard?

31
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,431
You're one to talk.
Chrismukkah, anyone?

32
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,194
- At least that's a real holiday.
- Tell her, Dad. It's two.

33
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,828
- Seth made that word up when he was 6.
- It's an important...

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,355
This is an important holiday.
It's Valentine's Day.

35
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,318
- Where Jewishness fuses with Christianity.
- Do the math.

36
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,752
- How you doing, kid?
- You know. Okay, I guess.

37
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,357
You're about to be great. Tomorrow
is the big Valentine's Day Singles' Gala.

38
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,715
A benefit for Newport Memorial's
Heart Department.

39
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,236
Big party. You guys are gonna dress up.
Everyone's gonna be there.

40
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,836
Just like normal, huh? Yes!

41
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,149
I'm gonna go.

42
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,359
- Ryan. Hey.
- Hey.

43
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,679
Were you able to sleep at all?

44
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,159
- Not much.
- Me either.

45
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,880
- I kept going over everything in my head.
- Yeah.

46
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,793
He's in the hospital,
so hopefully he'll get better.

47
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,359
I hope so.

48
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,513
I'm ready for everything to just
go back to normal. The way it was.

49
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,631
Great. So, Valentine's Day tomorrow.

50
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,916
- Yeah?
- What were you gonna do? Because...

51
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,116
...I didn't know if you wanted to...
- Yeah, no.

52
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,874
- Kirsten's hosting this singles' dance...
- For the hospital.

53
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,110
I told her I'd go.
I didn't know if you wanted...

54
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,554
Of course.

55
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,393
Right. Well, then I'll go too.

56
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,195
Who knows?
Maybe we'll meet somebody there.

57
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,793
Yeah. Who knows?

58
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,390
- All right. I should get to...
- Yeah. No. Me too.

59
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,909
Hey, Summer.

60
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,752
God, Cohen. You made me mess up.

61
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,912
- I'm going for the high score.
- Hey, it's good to see you too.

62
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,719
- Tomorrow's Valentine's Day.
- Oh, really?

63
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,269
God. I didn't know tomorrow
was Valentine's Day.

64
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,352
But thanks for reminding me.
Have fun with Anna.

65
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,114
- Anna's in Pittsburgh for the weekend.
- On Valentine's Day?

66
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,918
Hey, now that's commitment.

67
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,716
Actually, Anna and I broke up.

68
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,150
And I wanted to see
what you're doing tomorrow.

69
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,276
- So you guys broke up.
- Yeah.

70
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,353
Coffee. You're single now and you want
to know what I'm doing for Valentine's.

71
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,078
- Yeah.
- So Anna dumps you...

72
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,471
...and you think you can choose me
and I'd still be interested in you?

73
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,757
First of all, what makes you think
that Anna dumped me?

74
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,990
Never mind. Second of all...

75
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,790
...kind of. Yes.
- Yeah. No. No way.

76
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,110
I'm not gonna be your
sloppy seconds, ass-face.

77
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,994
Besides, I'm busy tomorrow.
I'll be at the singles' dance.

78
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,673
- So will I.
- I don't care.

79
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,989
- See you there.
- Not if I see you first.

80
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,835
- Maybe we'll both meet someone special.
- Yeah, as long as his name isn't Cohen.

81
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,352
Snap.

82
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,715
I'm sorry I'm late.

83
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,758
Crusading for the rich and dysfunctional
is time-consuming.

84
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,911
Let me just dot my I's and cross my T's.

85
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,516
Come on, I'm starving. I've been thinking
about crab cakes for the last hour.

86
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,591
Will you be around tomorrow
to help set up?

87
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,593
- For what?
- The Valentine's Day Single Dance Gala.

88
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,832
No. I can't do it.
I got this petty nuisance lawsuit. In fact...

89
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,396
...I'm pretty booked this weekend.

90
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,872
So I might be a little late to
the Valentine's Day Dance Singles' Gala.

91
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,758
- Singles.
- Singles' Dance Gala.

92
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,429
Why?

93
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,909
- We said we'd go together.
- It's restaurant stuff.

94
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,992
Got the zoning inspectors coming by
before we can expand the deck.

95
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,754
- On Saturday?
- I guess these city council guys are busy.

96
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,150
- No. I forbid it.
- You what?

97
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,629
With whatever wifely authority
I have vested in me...

98
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,234
...on this most holy
and romantic of days, no.

99
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,837
- It's only a holiday. Not even a real one.
- Not this again. Not on an empty stomach.

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,470
How about Arbor Day? Trees?
That's a good cause. Or Secretary's Day.

101
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,393
- How about our anniversary?
- Which we might not make it to.

102
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,630
You know you'll have more fun
without me.

103
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,837
No. You're going.
Sandy, this is important to me.

104
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,434
There's a lot of things
important to me that you don't do.

105
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,794
- Like what?
- Like golfing.

106
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,793
- Lots of couples golf together.
- Shortly before dying of old age.

107
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,428
Surfing. How often have I tried
to get you in the ocean?

108
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,637
- With the fish?
- And still I'm patient. I'm forgiving.

109
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,876
- You're joking.
- I put up with your father.

110
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,350
- You're eligible for sainthood any day.
- I forgive your snoring.

111
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,988
- I do not snore.
- Yeah, you do.

112
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,230
Like a freight train
roaring through the house.

113
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,436
You wanted to do this restaurant,
I supported you.

114
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,149
You wanted to go into private practice,
who had your back?

115
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,630
- I put up with your father.
- You never wanna do anything I like.

116
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,438
Everything's a fight, an argument.

117
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,637
- My life, my job.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, and I'm still here.

118
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,552
- Don't do me any favors.
- I won't.

119
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,119
- Fine.
- Perfect.

120
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,837
- What are we fighting about?
- I'm not sure.

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,319
But it's serious.

122
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,069
You're on your own for lunch.

123
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,792
Happy Valentine's Day.

124
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,790
Hey, kiddo.

125
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,277
Plasterer came to the restaurant today.
Made a total mess.

126
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,396
But progress is being made.

127
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,835
- How's school?
- Okay.

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,831
- Yeah?
- Hey, you got something.

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,150
It was left for you at the door.

130
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,913
Well, it's not ticking,
so it can't be from your mom.

131
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,955
"Hope you're not too Ionely
this Valentine's Day.

132
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,953
X O, X O. Your Secret Admirer."

133
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,998
Marissa, you're so sweet.
You didn't have to do that.

134
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,276
- I didn't.
- Well...

135
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,079
...who else would've left something nice?
- Good question.

136
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,557
This year I'm doing my best
to avoid Valentine's Day completely.

137
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,118
- What? You and Ryan are...?
- I don't really want to talk about it.

138
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,398
- And neither does he.
- Well, it is Valentine's Day.

139
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,475
Sometimes the big romantic gesture
is more effective than talking.

140
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,674
There's no way your mom
gave me these, right? No.

141
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,037
She doesn't make her disdain for me
a secret. Much less her admiration.

142
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,031
Well, have you kissed anyone recently?

143
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,998
<i>Previously on</i> The Valley:

144
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,594
<i>I just don 't feel like I fit</i>
<i>here in Tarzana.</i>

145
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,432
I'm busy. Studying...

146
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,318
...naked.

147
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,074
Is that supposed to keep me away?

148
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,238
Cohen?

149
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,236
- You're at my house.
- And you're dressed.

150
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,675
I wonder who's more disappointed.

151
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,109
- Can I come in?
- No.

152
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,315
Thanks.

153
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,196
What are you doing here?

154
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,109
Who's this?

155
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,599
- No one.
- "I'm not no one."

156
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,228
- Princess Sparkle. What do you want?
- She's Captain Oats' type.

157
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,709
You tell him to keep his hooves off.
As for you...

158
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,873
Wait, wait. Before you kick me out, can
you please give me a second to explain?

159
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,550
Okay, listen. Summer...

160
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,515
...it's not like...

161
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,831
...now that me and Anna broke up
I'm now choosing you.

162
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,592
Okay?

163
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,476
Because the whole reason
that we broke up...

164
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,676
...is because for me...

165
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,434
...it's always been you, Summer.

166
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,352
It's always been you.

167
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,988
I've tried to fight it,
and I've tried to deny it.

168
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,799
And I can't. I can't do it.

169
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,871
You're undeniable.

170
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,756
- Cohen?
- Yeah.

171
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,638
Do you happen...

172
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,357
...to have...

173
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,476
...you know...?
- Oh...

174
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,114
...yeah, I do. In my wallet.
- Yeah?

175
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,353
I was beginning to view it as sort of
a rabbit's foot, for good luck only, but...

176
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,750
You're about to get lucky.

177
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,989
Whatever you say, Summer. Yes.

178
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,992
Yes.

179
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,309
- Luke. Hi.
- Hi, Mrs. Cooper.

180
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,837
What are you doing here?

181
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,755
Do you know...? I was wondering,
did Marissa bring her bio textbook home?

182
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,071
Marissa doesn't live here anymore, Luke.
You know that.

183
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,714
Right. I must have forgot.

184
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,549
Right. Okay. Well, good night.

185
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,637
Tomorrow is the Valentine's Day party.
Are you gonna go?

186
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,588
Because I'm gonna go.
And I thought if you needed a ride...

187
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,788
Actually, everything that's happened
with Caleb and me...

188
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,269
...I think it's best I stay home.
Avoid this holiday.

189
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,714
Yeah.

190
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,110
It's just another day of the week, right?

191
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,077
Okay.

192
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,312
- Good night, Mrs. Cooper.
- Good night.

193
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,199
So...

194
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,157
...that was sex.

195
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,232
Yep.

196
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,274
- I'm gonna go.
- Me too.

197
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,839
But you live here.

198
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,911
I meant downstairs.

199
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,399
Okay.

200
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,152
Perfect.

201
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,113
Hi.

202
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,430
I love you so much.

203
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,394
We've waited a long time to...

204
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,873
...you know, and I thought maybe
we could start Valentine's Day early.

205
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,760
- No. Wait. Wait. Hold on.
- What?

206
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,638
Don't you want to?

207
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,233
No.

208
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,798
No. I mean, yeah.

209
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,473
Yeah, of course.

210
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,760
But with everything that's happened,
it just...

211
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,151
- It seems a little soon.
- I just wish it hadn't happened.

212
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,959
That we could still be like we were...

213
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,671
...and I wanted to make it up to you.
- You don't have to...

214
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,717
...do this.

215
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,357
No. You're right.

216
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,876
So I guess I'll go.

217
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,076
- Because this is just really...
- Wrong?

218
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,873
I was gonna say "embarrassing."
But I guess "wrong" works.

219
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,398
So it was nice to see you.
And I guess I'll see you again tomorrow.

220
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,753
- Hey, buddy. Got some big news.
- I was about to go set up. You coming?

221
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,751
It's a lot of lifting. It's not my thing.

222
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,832
I don't know if I just mentioned this,
but I have some big news.

223
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,992
- Yeah, so I heard. What's up?
- Ryan, I'm a man now.

224
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,197
Not just like an after-your-bar-mitzvah
man, but a "man" man.

225
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,114
I had sex with a girl.
Summer, to be more specific.

226
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,157
How was it?

227
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,318
- I had sex.
- That bad?

228
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,792
No, not that bad...

229
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,951
...just kind of weird.
- Weird?

230
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,635
Yeah, but not kinky weird.
More like weird awkward.

231
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,678
But, hey, it was my first time.
She's a more experienced woman.

232
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,989
That's to be expected.

233
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,790
And I did make some faces in the middle
that I wish I could take back, but I can't.

234
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,396
There was also sort of a whiny noise
that came out towards the end...

235
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,355
...that probably wasn't my finest hour.
I sucked so bad.

236
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,273
I was like a fish flopping around
on dry land.

237
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,319
Ryan, I was Nemo.
And I just wanted to go home.

238
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,314
- Don't worry. You'll get another chance.
- That's the thing. I'm not sure I will.

239
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,792
The situation with Summer is murkier now
than it was before the awful fish sex.

240
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,518
I wouldn't refer to it as fish sex.

241
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,558
Good point. That's something
I was hoping to get more of: Tips.

242
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,030
Tricks of the trade. Summer's used to
driving a higher performance vehicle.

243
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,430
Don't know if I'm the guy
to talk to about romance.

244
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,794
- Why?
- Me and Marissa.

245
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,872
- It's different now, post-Oliver.
- Yeah? You wanna talk about it?

246
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,395
- No, I should get over to set up.
- Hey.

247
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,630
So do you have tips
or words of wisdom for me?

248
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,279
Do it again.

249
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,710
That's what I was afraid of.

250
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,436
And then we both just decided to wait.
Because, you know, we were really tired.

251
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,477
Well, you know how it goes.

252
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,078
- I wish we had waited.
- What? Who?

253
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,517
Me and Cohen.

254
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,836
- We had sex.
- Wait, what?

255
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,679
You guys did what?

256
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,115
I've been with you an hour.
How did this not come up?

257
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,998
I must have forgotten.

258
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,353
Okay, so I lied.

259
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,559
Things last night with Ryan went terribly.
I think he hates me.

260
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,711
- He doesn't hate you.
- He turned down sex.

261
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,677
He might be onto something.

262
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,598
Hey. You can't beat yourself up over it.

263
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,672
No one knew that Oliver would
turn out to be such a Looney Tune.

264
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,354
Except Ryan, and I didn't listen.

265
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,719
I don't know.

266
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,917
Maybe we just weren't meant
to be together.

267
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,312
Maybe we're just chasing after
the wrong boys.

268
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,992
Hello.

269
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,996
- How long will this continue?
- You've ruined my favorite holiday.

270
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,391
So until Valentine's Day is over,
we have nothing to talk about.

271
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,557
- All right.
- Hey, Dad. Are you busy?

272
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,395
- Just enjoying your mother's company.
- Awesome, I need to talk to you.

273
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,472
- What's going on?
- Nothing. Just need to talk to you.

274
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,912
- Girl stuff.
- Well...

275
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,877
...you've come to the master.

276
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,153
Hey, I got you.

277
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,072
I was young, impressionable and drunk.

278
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,310
Yeah, only child. Right here.

279
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,716
I'll get it. I need a little fresh air.

280
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,590
I never thought that I would have to...

281
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,153
...say this, but I think that we...

282
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,989
...need to have the talk.

283
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,072
- Now?
- It'll be as hard for me as it is for you.

284
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,828
Hey. Happy Valentine's Day.

285
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,197
That's what I like.
A little holiday spirit around here.

286
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,998
- Thanks.
- Sure.

287
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,515
I love these.
You know what they're called?

288
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,195
Forgotten Kisses. And you know
who used to make these? Hailey.

289
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,839
Hailey?

290
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,309
And how's she doing?
You heard from her at all?

291
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,029
No, and I don't expect I will.
Because when she left, she left angry.

292
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,316
Who knows, she's probably in
Asia or New York.

293
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,710
- Quite the globetrotter.
- Sometimes.

294
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,553
Once we thought she was in London,
but she was on a friend's boat...

295
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,632
...just down here in the harbor.
- Boat, huh?

296
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,874
Well...

297
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,510
...did you, you know...?
Did you...

298
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,711
...wear protection?

299
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,999
Oh, my God. Yes.

300
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,071
God, yes. I don't believe
you asked me that.

301
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,470
I'm sorry, but I had to.
It's so good that you did.

302
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,949
If you're gonna have sex,
you gotta be responsible.

303
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,430
- Yes. Responsible and awkward.
- Well, that's to be expected.

304
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,108
- It is?
- Yeah.

305
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,838
- That's what I thought.
- Listen...

306
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,072
...you were lucky to be able to hang
in there after all that foreplay.

307
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,192
Fore-what now?

308
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,559
Foreplay.

309
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,599
Oh, yeah. You know.

310
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,830
Massaging. You know...

311
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,999
...or nibbling the neck. Here's the point,
just because you're ready to go...

312
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,549
...it doesn't mean she is.
- I'm always ready to go.

313
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,917
Well, you're my son.
We Cohens are very sexual beings.

314
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,116
- Oh, my God.
- Virile. Get used to it.

315
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,271
Just disgusting.

316
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,071
- Foreplay, huh?
- I'm telling you...

317
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,198
...the appetizer is as good
as the main course.

318
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,873
Just swallowed a bit of throw up.

319
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,918
Well, I'm gonna pretend we never
had this conversation...

320
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,197
...but thanks, Dad.
- Hey, Seth. Seth, so...

321
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,960
...do you mind my asking?
Who'd you...?

322
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,954
Who'd you sleep with? I mean,
you got so many girls these days.

323
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,793
Summer?

324
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,712
You dog, you.

325
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,512
So, man, how's everything
with you and Marissa?

326
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,309
- Is she coming to the party tonight?
- I don't know. Fifty-fifty.

327
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,958
What about her mom?
You think she's coming tonight?

328
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,997
I have no idea.

329
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,437
I was just trying to get a head count
for the event.

330
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,716
Whoa. Whoa. Sorry.

331
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,678
- Ryan.
- Theresa.

332
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,914
- What are...? Hi.
- You always had a way with words.

333
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,833
- Are you working here?
- Yeah.

334
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,755
What better way to celebrate Valentine's
than serve p ğt Á to a bunch of rich people?

335
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,993
Oh, these are your friends
and neighbors. Sorry.

336
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,752
It's good to see you.

337
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,431
Cohen. What are you doing?

338
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,431
I need to talk to you...

339
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,033
...about what happened.

340
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,918
You remember the...

341
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,671
...sex?
- I'm trying to forget.

342
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,229
Right. Right.
That's actually why I'm here.

343
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,277
I feel you didn't get your money's worth.

344
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,317
Make a bang-for-your-buck joke,
you're gone.

345
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,870
No jokes.
There should be nothing funny about...

346
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,632
...what goes on right here.

347
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,949
You want another shot?

348
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,276
That's what I'm saying.

349
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,668
Pretty good.

350
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,592
Not as slobbery as yesterday.

351
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,789
- A little tense there.
- Ow, what are you...?

352
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,478
- What's up with the Vulcan nerve pinch?
- A little massage.

353
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,029
Okay. No. You're totally tickling me.

354
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,633
Stop.

355
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,914
- Stop.
- Stopping. Stopping.

356
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,392
Okay, what the hell are you doing?

357
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,630
A little something
that I like to call foreplay.

358
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,233
No.

359
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,118
I knew not to listen to my dad.

360
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,158
Not that I listen to him.
I'd never talk about that with him.

361
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,392
- You know what I'm saying.
- No more talking, Cohen.

362
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,753
Whatever you say, Summer.

363
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,628
So now he's in the hospital.
He'll be there a while.

364
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,560
Wow. That's unbelievable.

365
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,712
- No wonder you're so pissed off.
- No, I'm not.

366
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,395
Sure you are. I'd be.
Your best friend didn't believe you.

367
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,712
People you live with didn't listen to you.
And your girlfriend didn't trust you.

368
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,518
When you put it that way...

369
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,116
Sorry, it's none of my business.

370
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,470
No, it feels good to talk about it.

371
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,517
I haven't, really, with anyone else.

372
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,874
Hey.

373
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,439
Luke didn't know if you'd...

374
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,988
Hi, Marissa.

375
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,435
Theresa. Thanksgiving. We...

376
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,956
- Yeah. No, I remember.
- I'm helping cater the event.

377
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,348
She's a caterer.

378
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,432
Oh, well, that's really great.

379
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,189
So I guess I'll just talk to you tonight.

380
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,311
- You'll be here?
- Yeah.

381
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,396
- And so will you.
- Yeah.

382
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,278
Okay. Bye.

383
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,438
- I should get back too.
- Yeah, see you tonight.

384
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,472
Sorry.

385
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,799
One day, when I'm reflecting
back on my life...

386
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,316
...I think I'll remember these chats
before big events as my favorite times.

387
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,198
What's this one about?

388
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,232
- What did you do to your eye?
- It's just a little bit blurry.

389
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,278
- Summer poked me in it with her big toe.
- What? Why?

390
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,512
Accident. There were limbs everywhere.
I'm lucky I can still see.

391
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,634
- So you guys did the deed again?
- Technically, yes. But it wasn't pretty.

392
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,475
- I think I suffered a spinal injury too.
- Next time you should wear a helmet.

393
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,438
- Mouth guard.
- I don't think there will be a next time.

394
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,117
Not after this latest debacle.
I think it might be over.

395
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,478
And what sucks about that, though, is
that I know I have so much more to give.

396
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,596
- I don't need to know that.
- Fair enough.

397
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,398
What about you?
Wanna skip the event?

398
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,630
I would, but there's someone
I wanna see.

399
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,114
Just an old friend.

400
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,552
If you want to skip it,
I'd be more than happy to. Believe me.

401
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,478
- I don't want to go either.
- Great.

402
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,200
But I have to.
Ryan's ex is gonna be there.

403
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,989
- She's a caterer tonight.
- And you want to what, spy?

404
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,077
Not exactly.

405
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,313
Yes.

406
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,790
Look, I don't know, Summ.
I don't know what's going on between us.

407
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,155
And now this girl is gonna be there.

408
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,719
Hug?

409
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,840
- Are you limping?
- Yeah. Cohen kneed me in the leg.

410
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,958
- Why?
- Must've read it in the <i>Kamasutra.</i>

411
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,873
- So you guys had sex again?
- Lf you can call it that.

412
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,157
There were, like, limbs everywhere.

413
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,595
- Love hurts.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

414
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,314
- You a cop?
- No.

415
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,552
No, I'm just looking for someone
who's staying here.

416
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,790
- Jimmy.
- Hey. Hailey.

417
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,278
Okay. Interesting company
you keep there.

418
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,749
You tracked me down. I'm impressed.

419
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,276
Those cookies were so good
that I couldn't let you leave without...

420
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,194
...giving me the recipe. Definitely gonna
be on the menu of my new restaurant.

421
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,555
- Your new restaurant?
- In fact, I was wondering...

422
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,757
...if you wanted to be
the first customer.

423
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,157
I'm experimenting with some dishes.

424
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,232
And I thought maybe, you know,
you could be the guinea pig.

425
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,073
Okay. Let me go get changed.

426
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,038
I'll be right back.

427
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,516
Maybe a couple months.
He's only in...

428
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,477
Take care. I'll see you soon.

429
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,272
All right.

430
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,228
Hey. If I teach you guys anything,
don't ever get married.

431
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,868
- I've heard that from you before.
- You'll hear it again.

432
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,632
I'll be at the bar.

433
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,999
No sign of our opponents.

434
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,913
- You ready to go?
- Yeah. Since before we got here.

435
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,308
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, there.

436
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,109
Want some of this...?
I actually have no idea what this is.

437
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,590
Odds are, mushroom leek crescent,
crab and brie phyllo. Usually is.

438
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,671
Seth, this is my friend Theresa.

439
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,549
Oh, this is your friend Theresa?
Hi. How are you? I'm gonna go with...

440
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,995
- That's her.
- That's her?

441
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,991
She's hot.

442
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,559
For Chino.

443
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,393
No. She is. She's beautiful...

444
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:33,838
...and nice and smart and funny, and did
I mention they've been friends forever?

445
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,309
- Only a few times.
- They did musicals together.

446
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,948
- And went to the winter dance.
- Ryan did musicals?

447
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,395
She was Peppermint Patty.

448
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,551
Ryan was Snoopy.

449
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,273
God, I hate Valentine's Day.

450
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,193
I don't know why we celebrate anything
around here.

451
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,713
- My dad didn't show up, huh?
- Nope.

452
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,555
I'm gonna go home, run a bath, and either
slit my wrists or drink a bottle of wine.

453
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,472
Wine. Definitely.

454
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,155
Good thing Kaitlin's at a sleepover.
I'll be blasting Bob Seger tonight.

455
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,231
We'll keep our windows closed.

456
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,391
- Bye.
- Bye.

457
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,997
Can we just start over?

458
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,153
Start over?

459
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,357
Hi. I'm Marissa.
You go to Harbor, right?

460
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,678
I know what you're trying to do.

461
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,232
And I can't.

462
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,319
I'm sorry.

463
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,915
Can I talk to you for a second?

464
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,072
- Look, if you want another shot...
- No. No. Believe me.

465
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,310
I get it. Clearly...

466
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,358
...something's not working.
It's me. It's fine. It's my fault.

467
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,312
- What are you trying to say?
- Maybe in a few years, you know?

468
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,311
I'll be...

469
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,629
I guess I'll be ready for you,
I don't know.

470
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,589
But in the meantime,
I think I'm just gonna...

471
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,591
I'm just gonna bow out.

472
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,919
No, that's not asbestos.
Those are called floaties.

473
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,958
Asbestos and champagne.

474
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,553
What could be more romantic?

475
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:56,748
It's a work in progress. There's actually
nothing on the menu right now.

476
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,797
But the cookies are good.

477
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,113
- This place is gonna be great, Jimmy.
- Yeah. I know.

478
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,636
I feel for the first time in a while
that my life is... It's coming together.

479
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,394
So I don't understand, you know...

480
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,074
...I thought you couldn't
get out of here fast enough.

481
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,356
Yeah...

482
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,432
...until I realized I had nowhere to go.

483
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,917
- No one to see.
- Hailey, you can get stuck here.

484
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,516
You drive down the same streets,
go to the same places. It feels like...

485
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,559
...time isn't passing, but it is.
And it'll pass you right by.

486
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,473
You owe it to yourself.
Get out. Get free.

487
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,791
- Make a life for yourself.
- Why do I need to leave?

488
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,632
You're here.

489
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,431
Exactly.

490
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,000
I mean, you know, we can't...

491
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,473
Well...

492
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,474
...why not?
- Because I feel guilty enough...

493
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,154
...lying to Kirsten about the cookies...

494
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,390
...let alone...

495
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,278
Right.

496
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,272
But believe me...

497
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,958
...I wish we could.

498
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,711
I believe you.

499
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,879
Hey.

500
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,079
You okay?

501
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,155
- Cigarette?
- I quit.

502
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,718
Ryan Atwood. Look at yourself.

503
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,469
New clothes. New haircut.

504
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,949
Dating the homecoming queen.

505
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,071
Was dating?

506
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,554
I guess. I don't know.

507
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,759
- I like the haircut, by the way.
- Yeah?

508
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,630
You ever think about coming home?

509
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,272
Sometimes.

510
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,317
More lately.

511
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,550
You ever think about leaving?

512
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,996
Yeah. All the time.
But I don't know how.

513
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,909
So when you took
this particular catering job...

514
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,116
I needed the money.

515
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,158
And, yes...

516
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,550
...I was hoping I might run into you.

517
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,039
Home's Ionely these days.

518
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,999
Are you on a break?

519
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,912
Yeah. I'm free until cleanup.

520
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,752
You wanna get out of here?

521
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,230
Is it okay if I hang here?

522
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,957
Yeah. Sure. Of course.

523
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,557
Valentine's Day is wonderful, isn't it?

524
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,392
- You know, the thing about Ryan...
- No, this isn't...

525
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,711
- It's not... I'm fine.
- I know.

526
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,953
But the thing about Ryan is,
whenever things have gotten tough...

527
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,157
...everyone in his life has abandoned him.
- That's what he thinks I did.

528
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,719
Surprise him. Show him you didn't.

529
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,514
- That you're not gonna give up on him.
- He wants me to.

530
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,990
Well, only because he expects you to.
It's crazy.

531
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,514
Love is crazy.

532
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,319
It's always challenging. It's never easy.

533
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,278
- Yeah, but is it always this hard?
- Sometimes.

534
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,431
But you hang in there anyway.

535
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,795
If you're having the worst fight
in the world...

536
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,748
...or some stupid argument that neither
of you can remember what it's about.

537
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,592
Because it's...

538
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,512
It's worth it.

539
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,596
You guys have been
through so much already.

540
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,911
Why quit now?

541
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,438
- Hey, Mr. Cohen.
- Hello, Summer.

542
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,353
- Hi. Coop, you ready to go?
- Yeah.

543
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,829
- You okay, kiddo?
- Yeah. Thanks.

544
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,556
- Sometimes you make it hard to hate you.
- I know.

545
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,712
It's all... It's all... It's part of my charm.

546
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,189
Sometimes you make it easy.

547
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,629
- Charming too, no?
- Let's go home.

548
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,194
You tried to jump that fence
and your pants got caught.

549
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,509
I was pretty graceful.

550
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,911
- Yeah, especially when you face-planted.
- Glad to see you enjoy my pain.

551
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,833
We had no ice and we had to use
that bag of frozen peas.

552
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,197
Yeah. Frozen vegetables.
The miracle cure.

553
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,075
It's pretty amazing, us running into
each other on Valentine's Day.

554
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,033
I gotta get back. Help clean up.

555
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,198
So do you go to a lot
of these kinds of events?

556
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,236
Pretty much every week.

557
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,433
Well, then maybe I'll run into you again.

558
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,794
Plus, I know where you live.

559
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,959
- Oh, God.
- I know I shouldn't be here.

560
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,714
- No, you shouldn't, Luke.
- But it's just...

561
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,871
I don't know,
you looked so sad when you left.

562
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,350
I couldn't bear the thought of you
being alone on Valentine's Day.

563
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,034
Most people would enjoy that thought.

564
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,758
Not me.

565
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,990
Mrs. Cooper, you are an amazing girl.

566
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,913
Woman.

567
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,913
Lady.

568
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,556
- Lf Mr. Nichol doesn't appreciate you...
- No. He sure doesn't.

569
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,554
That's because he's too old to see
what he's lucky enough to have.

570
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,393
And you should also know that
you have always been the coolest mom.

571
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,716
- Luke.
- It's true. You let us listen to...

572
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:00,271
...whatever we wanted to in the carpool.
And you let us watch R-rated movies.

573
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:05,036
- And whenever we played Ultimatum...
- Ultimatum?

574
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,956
You know, who, of all your
friends' moms, would you rather do?

575
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,912
- That's a game?
- And whenever we played it...

576
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,197
...you always won.
- Really?

577
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,593
- I beat Kirsten?
- I thought you should know the truth...

578
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,796
...on Valentine's Day.

579
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,918
- Good night.
- Wait.

580
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,868
Thank you.

581
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,191
Would you like to come in?

582
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,717
I guess you're happy that today is over.

583
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,711
Absolutely.

584
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,674
Oh, my God, Sandy.

585
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,316
Somebody's got to keep
Hershey's and Hallmark in business.

586
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,719
- So you want to be my Valentine?
- Yes.

587
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,237
Just as soon as I have some of these
caramel chocolates. They're my favorite.

588
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,039
The square ones.
I like the ones with nuts.

589
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,668
Not to rub it in, man,
but I think Princess Sparkle is your type.

590
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,115
Yeah, I blew it for us both.

591
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,589
What's that?

592
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,591
Yeah. Are you kidding?
Great hooves.

593
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,520
- Cohen?
- Summer.

594
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,511
- Hey.
- Hey.

595
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,879
No.

596
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,558
The other night...

597
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,878
...when we...

598
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,113
...had sex.
- Yeah.

599
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,875
You weren't the only virgin in the room.

600
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,789
There was someone else in the room?
Like, filming us?

601
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,837
Me, jackass.

602
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,469
I'm a virgin.

603
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,029
Or I was a virgin.

604
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,517
Why didn't you tell me?

605
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,716
I don't know.

606
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,556
I guess I felt like
I had this reputation to uphold...

607
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,112
...and I figured you'd think less of me.
- No.

608
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,075
Are you kidding? Not at all.
I'm just... I'm shocked.

609
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:04,236
God. Never in a million years would I
think that you, of all people, not that...

610
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,755
That is not what's important here.

611
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,753
This was a huge moment in our lives
and we just blew past it.

612
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,876
- Really quickly.
- Hey, not that quickly.

613
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,196
Pretty quickly, yes.

614
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,078
And it was a big deal.

615
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,357
I think that it should've been special.

616
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,397
And we rushed it.

617
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,796
What if...

618
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,709
...we were to slow it down a little bit?

619
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,276
Maybe...

620
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,676
...start from the beginning?

621
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,752
What do you mean?

622
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,909
- You are so cheesy, Cohen.
- Come on.

623
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,275
I'm sweeping you off your feet.

624
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:03,156
Well, the sad part is...

625
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,997
...you kind of are.

626
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,151
- Where is she?
- What?

627
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,995
Theresa. If she's here, I want her
to know I'm not gonna lose you.

628
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,230
I'm not gonna give up on you.

629
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,197
She left.

630
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,392
- I'm so sorry.
- I know.

631
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,835
Can't you just forgive me?

632
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,359
How?

633
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,317
I don't know...

634
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,276
...if we should be together.

635
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:18,434
I mean, look how easy it was for someone
to come into our lives, come between us.

636
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,438
- How do I know it won't happen again?
- It won't.

637
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,068
- You have to trust me.
- Like you trusted me.

638
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,318
Ryan.

639
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,393
So that's it?

640
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,548
I can't pretend it didn't happen.
