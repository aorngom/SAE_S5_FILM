<i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,233
- Hi, Theresa.
- Hi, Marissa.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,992
- Eddie.
- I'm looking for Theresa.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,798
- We're engaged.
- Engaged?

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,838
- You look good.
- I'm Marissa's mother. You're a student.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,036
- You mean it's over?
- No, I'll see you tonight.

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,758
A friend's in trouble.
I want you to help him.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,989
Uncle Shaun.
In that room...

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,515
...you accidentally stumbled
into were documents...

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,750
...containing information
valuable to Caleb.

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,150
- Construction's a dirty business.
- My answer's no.

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,958
And Kirsten? She's complicit in this.

13
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,553
- Do you love her?
- I don't know.

14
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,835
Be ready to fight for her.

15
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,678
- I don't want you to go.
- Why don't I want to go?

16
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,836
- But what kind of kiss was it?
- I don't know.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,877
A kiss. My lips, Theresa's lips. A kiss.

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,429
Lips. Now, that's interesting.
Was there tongue?

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,352
- I'm not answering that.
- Why?

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,431
- You really want to know?
- No.

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,194
But just tell me this:
What level of kiss are we talking?

22
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,391
Was it like a Christina-Madonna peck?

23
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,596
Or was it a Britney-Madonna
sort of smooch?

24
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,150
Or was it like a full-on
Al and Tipper Gore lip-Iock?

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,709
- It was just a kiss.
- Okay. So you guys a couple now?

26
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,475
Is she staying here? If so, where's she
gonna live? How? What's her credit like?

27
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,315
What sort of lease is she looking to sign?
Are we talking a year or month-to-month?

28
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,710
- Or is she looking to buy?
- There's no lease, okay?

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,791
So then what? She goes back?
What do you do?

30
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,518
Commute back and forth from Chino?

31
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,716
If you're commuting,
whose car you gonna take?

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,917
How you gonna pay for gas?
What freeway is your freeway of choice?

33
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,914
You gonna take the 55 to the 5?
Or the 91 to the 71? If you take the 71...

34
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,031
- Just, whoa.
- Okay. I'll just whoa.

35
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,636
You guys kissed, and I think you should
have a plan, because it's a big deal.

36
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,552
- You're making it a big deal.
- Really?

37
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,199
I don't even know when
I'd see her again.

38
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,430
- Hi.
- Theresa. Hey.

39
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,511
Hey. We were just
discussing your plan.

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,318
- What plan?
- Yeah, exactly.

41
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,948
I had the morning off,
thought you'd need a ride to school.

42
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,314
- Oh, yeah. Great.
- Yeah.

43
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,948
- I hope it's okay, me stopping by.
- It's fine. Come on.

44
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,509
- Yeah. Sure. Why wouldn't it be?
- Okay.

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,713
- Marissa. Hello.
- Hey.

46
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,759
- Theresa. Hi. I didn't think you'd be...
- Staying? Yeah, well...

47
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,435
- What's up?
- I thought maybe you'd need a ride...

48
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,874
...to school.
- Oh. Thanks.

49
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,719
Cool.

50
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,594
Well, I can go with Marissa,
and Ryan and Theresa can go together.

51
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,673
- No. No, Seth, really. It's okay.
- It makes more sense if you take them.

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,276
Why? Because we go to the same school?
Because I live here?

53
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,717
I'll go with Marissa,
and Ryan and Theresa can go...

54
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,757
Yeah. Sorry. You know what?

55
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,309
- I should have called first.
- I should've called too.

56
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,790
- I'll just see you guys at school.
- I shouldn't just stop by. I'm gonna go.

57
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,428
- No, wait, wait. It's...
- Call me later.

58
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,629
We're hitchhiking.

59
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,509
- Morning, beautiful.
- Good morning.

60
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,994
Marissa.

61
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,629
Kirsten. Sandy.

62
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,752
Well, you're not gonna believe who is
<i>Riviera Magazine</i>'s Man of the Year.

63
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,434
- Theresa.
- Mrs. Cohen. Mr. Cohen.

64
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,869
Well, that's nice. I mean, she really
deserves the award. Good kid.

65
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,792
It's my dad.

66
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,995
My vote stays with Theresa.

67
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,518
- Hi.
- Hey. Is it a good morning?

68
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,478
So, Ryan, a couple of your friends
stopped by briefly.

69
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,029
- Yeah, we know. It was awkward.
- Is Theresa staying?

70
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,668
- Yeah. Looks that way.
- I thought she was going home.

71
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,398
No. Change of plans.

72
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,471
It's amazing. His lips don't even move.

73
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,229
- Well, how long is she staying?
- Well...

74
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,313
You tell them.

75
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,872
- We're figuring it all out.
- Is she gonna, what, rent a place?

76
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,474
What kind of lease? Month-to-month?
Year? Can she buy?

77
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,796
- What you gonna do?
- I'm this way for a reason.

78
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,236
- She's catering a tennis tournament.
- Is she gonna get a job after that?

79
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,631
- What about the guy she's engaged to?
- Is she going back to school?

80
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,113
- School. Bye.
- Now you know why I do the talking.

81
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,794
We're gonna need a ride,
by the way. Thanks.

82
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,996
I'll take them.
It's on my way to the office.

83
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,436
- So is my dad gonna be in a good mood?
- Well, he should be.

84
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,353
- He's Man of the Year.
- I meant the case.

85
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,193
- Are you gonna take it?
- I'm thinking about it.

86
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,874
We're gonna host the reception here
for my dad's award.

87
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,793
And it would be nice if Uncle Shaun
could be here.

88
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,269
Not if we have to pay for the bar tab.

89
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,910
I'm thinking about it.

90
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,392
Hey.

91
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,039
Hey.

92
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,356
Can I ask you something?

93
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,112
Yeah. Sure.

94
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,310
When you and I broke up,
and I started dating Ryan...

95
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,356
...was it hard for you to see us together?
- Yeah.

96
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,637
But, hey, we wouldn't
have broken up if I hadn't...

97
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,636
...deserved it.
- I guess now I know...

98
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,438
...what it feels like, huh?

99
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,716
To deserve it.

100
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,398
The sooner you realize that it's never
gonna go back to the way it was...

101
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,680
...the sooner you can move on.

102
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,716
Okay. I'll see you guys later.

103
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,668
- Hey, Ryan. I'm sorry about this morning.
- No, no. That's okay.

104
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,470
- I didn't realize she was gonna be there.
- Yeah. There was a change of plans.

105
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,039
How long is she staying for?

106
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,078
No, she's gotta find a job, a place to live.

107
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,879
- Minor details, huh?
- Yeah.

108
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,509
Well, if you need any help...

109
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,392
Thanks.

110
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,714
- Check out Gramps. He looks angry.
- That's because he is.

111
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,393
Why? He's on a magazine cover.

112
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,869
Hard to believe that doesn't
leave him fulfilled.

113
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,032
Totally. I know. I love the society page.

114
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,919
It's like, suddenly, all of the people
we know are famous.

115
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,833
- Diana Kahn totally got a chin implant.
- They have chin implants?

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,389
My dad does them.
He says chins are the new nose.

117
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,315
- So did Picasso.
- Really? What hospital does he work for?

118
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,196
Kidding. I'm not that dumb. Just shallow.

119
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,757
Is all this talk of Newport and
plastic surgery boring you, Anna?

120
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,115
No. Actually, I'm savoring it.

121
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,750
I won't be hearing it much longer.
I'm leaving.

122
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,435
- You getting dessert?
- No. I'm going back to Pittsburgh.

123
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,828
- What?
- I'm gonna go live...

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,356
...with my aunt and uncle.
I've just kind of had enough of Newport...

125
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,476
...so I'm leaving.

126
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,355
Park-ranger cadet?
Full-time position available.

127
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,551
I wouldn't look good in the hat.

128
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,154
You'd get to put out forest fires.

129
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,675
Moving on.

130
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,475
Classifieds are...

131
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,710
Depressing?

132
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,156
- We'll find something. We'll figure it out.
- I know.

133
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,754
I'm glad you called me to come meet you.

134
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,199
Who knew being unemployed
could be so much fun?

135
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,316
I gotta get to class.

136
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,679
- It will be okay.
- Okay.

137
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,953
Kaitlin. Hi.

138
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,156
Hi, Luke. What's going on?

139
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,154
Well, I just finished school for the day,
you know, which is always a good thing.

140
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,959
I so know what you mean.

141
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,397
- Luke. What are you doing here?
- We're talking, Mom.

142
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,514
Go get ready.
Daddy's coming to take you to dinner.

143
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,234
So I'll see you soon?

144
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,957
Luke, you know not to
come to the house.

145
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,236
- We meet at the motel.
- I just thought...

146
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,356
...that you needed help
with your DSL.

147
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,478
Luke, as much as I want
high-speed Internet access...

148
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,712
...it's not worth Kaitlin
becoming suspicious.

149
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,909
Hey, Jules. Luke.

150
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,833
Luke just came by
to defrag my hard drive.

151
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,399
Okay.

152
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,755
Hurry along, Luke. Make it quick.

153
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,715
I'll make sure Kaitlin's ready.

154
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,592
Hey, should I put another piece of
swordfish on for Theresa? Or Marissa?

155
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,950
Or any other ladies you plan
on having over?

156
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,352
- I was gonna go pick up Theresa, so...
- Done and done.

157
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,080
So how's that going with you guys?

158
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,916
Good. Just trying to figure it out.

159
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,117
- "It" being?
- Pretty much everything.

160
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,272
- You want to know what I think?
- You're gonna tell me either way.

161
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,796
Like my own son.
You're in high school, she should be...

162
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,669
...you're both in way over your heads.
She's got no real job, no place to live.

163
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,910
- Don't ask if she can stay here.
- I wouldn't.

164
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,436
Good. You have no idea what Kirsten did
the last time I floated such a concept.

165
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,239
Theresa's got family in Chino.
She's got a life in Chino.

166
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,914
Running away is not the answer.

167
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,508
I know.

168
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,319
- It's kind of crazy.
- No. It's sweet.

169
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,678
It's totally misguided,
but it's kind of charming.

170
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:14,358
You gotta tell her. It's time she faced
the music. Or at least the fianc Á.

171
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,195
And you're gonna do that thing with
the white lights in your back yard, right?

172
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,273
- Of course, Dad.
- Good. I love the white lights.

173
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,671
- And no cilantro. I hate cilantro.
- You're Man of the Year.

174
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,354
I think they can make some food
without cilantro.

175
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,118
I'll have to make a toast.

176
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,510
You've got that '73 Dom
in your wine cellar, yes?

177
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,830
I think you went through that
on your birthday.

178
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,398
- Kirsten. Mr. Nichol.
- Why don't you call him Caleb.

179
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,797
- Congrats on your award.
- Means nothing.

180
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,349
They're lucky I agreed to pose
for their front cover.

181
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,398
Use that in your speech.
Want me to set a place for Theresa?

182
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,791
- I'll get back to you on that one.
- I'm gonna go check on the Dom.

183
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,158
- I was thinking chardonnay for dinner.
- No, get the pinot.

184
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,639
Do what you like. It's your house.
I'm just making a salad.

185
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,598
Man of the Year and still so modest.

186
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,718
I'm so glad to see it
hasn't gone to your head, Cal.

187
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,269
The case. Have you made your decision?

188
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,275
I've decided what it'll take to make me
decide. You tell Kirsten everything.

189
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,917
- She's better off not knowing.
- She's not. You are.

190
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,040
She is already implicated,
without her knowledge.

191
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,872
Then why worry her?

192
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,918
- This may all go away, you know.
- It may not.

193
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,911
I won't spend the next year
lying to her.

194
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,753
So if you want my help,
you tell her everything.

195
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,712
- Hi.
- Hey.

196
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,348
- We should talk.
- I have news.

197
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,313
You go first.

198
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,312
I just got off the phone with Eddie.

199
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,036
And I told him I'm not coming home
anytime soon.

200
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,869
- You did?
- He didn't take it well.

201
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,679
But now that I did it,
which I can't believe I did...

202
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,799
...I feel so much more free or something.

203
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,829
What did you want to talk about?

204
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,350
How do you feel about swordfish?

205
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,237
- So she's leaving.
- No, she's staying.

206
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,753
What? When did you
talk to Anna?

207
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,831
She told me she's going
back to Pittsburgh.

208
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,471
- Anna's going back to Pittsburgh?
- Not anymore, according to you.

209
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,037
- I'm totally confused.
- She, Anna, is leaving.

210
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,191
She, Theresa, is staying.

211
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,112
Right. Got it.

212
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,909
- So she really is leaving.
- That sucks.

213
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,193
Do you think it's because of me?

214
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,195
I can't believe I caused a girl
to leave the state.

215
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,557
- The county, maybe. Sure. Fine.
- You really think it's because of you?

216
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,390
Well, I mean, we broke up, she went
back East, she had a great time...

217
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,312
...she comes back, only to see me...

218
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,119
...standing on a coffee cart
declaring my love for Summer.

219
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,675
Maybe she just doesn't feel
that comfortable here.

220
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,355
I know. I get that. But if it is because
of me, maybe I can talk her out of it.

221
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,476
Except I can't ask her
if it's because of me...

222
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,437
...without sounding totally
self-absorbed.

223
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,398
And I'm not self-absorbed, right, Ryan?
Me. Me.

224
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,439
- Me.
- Sorry. Just thinking about Theresa.

225
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,076
- She's staying. What am I gonna do?
- She's leaving. What am I gonna do?

226
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,309
Kiki, thanks for meeting me.

227
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,517
- Is everything okay?
- Why don't you have a seat.

228
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,715
Is it Uncle Shaun?

229
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,036
The hotel room that he accidentally
stumbled into the other day...

230
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,953
- Joel McKuin was staying there.
- That's quite a coincidence.

231
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,396
Joel McKuin is the leading lumber
supplier on the West Coast.

232
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,274
Not such a coincidence.

233
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,309
It's not the first time that he's
accidentally stumbled into a hotel room.

234
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,391
It's just the first time he's got caught.

235
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,471
I knew Uncle Shaun
was a tough negotiator.

236
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,916
And, yeah, he sent extra-nice
Christmas presents to certain Teamsters.

237
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,390
Breaking and entering? Theft? What else?

238
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,597
Blackmail? Racketeering?

239
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,075
- Is he going to jail?
- Not if Sandy can help it.

240
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,630
Well, if he can't,
are they gonna go after you?

241
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,108
I'm afraid it's not just me.

242
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,913
Hey.

243
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,437
- Catching up on Western civ?
- Yeah, Spanish Inquisition. Lot of fun.

244
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,717
Tell me about it.
Could they give us any more reading?

245
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,717
- Get up.
- Eddie. Eddie, what's going on?

246
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,348
You know exactly what's going on.

247
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,230
- You sleep with her?
- No. No.

248
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,868
No? Then why'd she call me
and say she's not coming back?

249
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,349
- Why would she stay here?
- This isn't the right time.

250
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,988
No, don't touch me.
After all I did for you growing up.

251
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,639
The least you can do is
be honest with me.

252
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,756
Now, you be a man, and you tell me.

253
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,672
- Are you sleeping with her?
- No.

254
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,277
Excuse me. This lounge is
for faculty and students only.

255
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,950
I'm not letting her go.

256
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,918
Anna. Hey.

257
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,877
- Hi.
- This is nice weather we're having.

258
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,156
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Oh, did you hear? The Lakers won.

259
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,436
- Oh, did they?
- Yeah. Yeah, they did.

260
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,637
There's something else I wanted
to talk to you about. What was it?

261
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,791
That's it. You're leaving.

262
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,758
- Why the hell are you leaving?
- You know, I'm late for class.

263
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,434
- You got at least three minutes.
- It's too complicated.

264
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,160
Why don't you start with one reason.
There's gotta be...

265
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,471
...one main, overriding reason.
- Fine. Look, I miss the seasons.

266
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,633
I miss fall foliage. I miss the snow.
I miss the first signs of spring.

267
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,394
- You miss the seasons?
- Yeah, and...

268
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,513
And?

269
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,513
And my little dog, Swifty.
We left him with my aunt and uncle.

270
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,639
And the Jimmy Stewart Museum.
And Peanut Butter Cup Pie at Dingbats.

271
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:21,591
The vinyl selection at Record Village.
And Sundays, the SuperFlea Fleamarket.

272
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,428
I guess I did get it
into three minutes, huh?

273
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,673
So that's it? There's not, like,
one other reason?

274
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,718
- Did I say Peanut Butter Cup Pies?
- Yeah.

275
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,952
- Then, no.
- Good. Excellent.

276
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,155
Tomorrow, we're having this thing
for my grandpa...

277
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,356
- I leave tomorrow.
- Not without saying goodbye.

278
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,112
- I'll come say goodbye.
- Okay.

279
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,158
Is there anything I can do to help?

280
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,594
- You, Theresa...?
- Yeah, sure.

281
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,228
She needs a job and a place to live,
if you got anything.

282
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,789
Does she need a friend?
I could help out there.

283
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,394
Invite her to Caleb's party.
We'll all hang out.

284
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,393
Why the hell would you want that?

285
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,240
Look, I'm used to getting what I want.

286
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,073
Which I know is not
the most attractive quality.

287
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,310
But I also know I can't compete
with a girl...

288
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,516
...you've known your whole life.

289
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,832
Not after everything that's
just come between us.

290
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,916
I don't think she has clothes,
a dress, for it.

291
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,870
But thanks.

292
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,519
Hey.

293
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,831
- How was the rest of your day?
- I wanted to see how you were doing.

294
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,952
After the Heights,
I knew that my dad wasn't aboveboard.

295
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,590
But this is beyond anything
that I could have imagined.

296
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,079
We're gonna figure this out.

297
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,635
You better believe I'll do
all I can to protect you.

298
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,315
No. I don't want you to.
I'm going to get outside counsel.

299
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,074
I do not want you involved.

300
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,594
When I asked for your help,
I had no idea what I was asking you for.

301
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,718
- I know that.
- But this is my mistake, not yours.

302
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:25,000
And I will not let you compromise
yourself, not even for me.

303
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,957
I'm gonna call the caterers.

304
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,033
Make sure that there's no cilantro
for the Man of the Year.

305
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,836
She's lying. I know it.

306
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,709
- What? Who?
- Anna.

307
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,668
- You're thinking about Anna right now?
- I just...

308
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,071
I just wish I could convince her
not to leave because of me.

309
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,198
You think she's leaving
just because of you?

310
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,157
It makes sense, doesn't it?

311
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,595
Yeah. But even if I thought it,
I wouldn't say it.

312
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,390
I mean, it's a little self-absorbed, Cohen.

313
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,835
- I just never wanted to hurt her feelings.
- Maybe she just doesn't like it here.

314
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,389
I hear there are a few people who don't.

315
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,836
It does rain sometimes in January.

316
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,671
I'm kind of...

317
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,828
I'm kind of hungry. You want to eat?

318
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,953
Thanks.

319
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,472
- Hi.
- Hey.

320
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,359
Are you still good at foot massages?
I've been on my feet...

321
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,671
- We gotta talk.
- So no foot massage?

322
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,150
Listen. Listen, I don't know
what to do about us.

323
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,596
I can't get you a job, a place to live.

324
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,318
- I live in a pool house.
- Shut up.

325
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,790
Shut the hell up.
I don't need you to take care of me.

326
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,951
- I can take care of myself.
- I know, I know.

327
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,591
I am not one of these Newport chicks
that needs a trust fund to survive.

328
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,550
But the fact that you thought
I needed you is really great.

329
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,677
Sweet.

330
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,112
Sexy.

331
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,430
What about Eddie?

332
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,397
I told Eddie that I can't
marry him right now.

333
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,471
Just because you're okay with it
doesn't mean he is.

334
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,712
I'm not okay with it,
I just know it's for the best.

335
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,515
I'm here to be with you.

336
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,439
Are we doing this?

337
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,757
It's not like we haven't before.

338
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,309
- What's the matter?
- It's not like home.

339
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,153
I got people that notice
if I don't get back.

340
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,756
I had the day off. If you want to go
to the beach or to the pier tonight...

341
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,032
- Actually, I have a thing.
- A thing?

342
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,395
Kirsten's dad is being honored
by some magazine.

343
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,632
They're having a cocktail party
at the Cohen house.

344
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,399
You...

345
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,198
You want to come?

346
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,155
Do you want me to come?

347
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,949
- I'm kind of getting the vibe that...
- No. Yeah. No.

348
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,998
It's just, you know what these things
are like, these people...

349
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,798
And it might be kind of weird.

350
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,316
The girl who serves food at the party
is now a guest at the party.

351
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,799
I wasn't saying that.

352
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,909
- I feel like you're not trying to invite me.
- No, I do. I am.

353
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,116
I didn't think you'd want to go.

354
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,157
I don't want to go.

355
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,312
I want to make sure you're not
embarrassed to bring me to things.

356
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,879
I'm not.

357
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,589
Good. I have nothing to wear anyway.

358
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,513
But come over after,
and we can both wear nothing.

359
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,635
Well, if you keep looking up like that,
all you're gonna see is a bad shot.

360
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,394
Hey, Hodes. How are things
at the DA's office?

361
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:09,156
Better since you left the PD's office.
My people seem to win a few more.

362
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,592
That's why I left.
I started feeling bad for you.

363
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,116
So why don't I think it's a
wild coincidence to see you here?

364
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,630
You have trust issues.
That's why you've never been married.

365
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,191
Well, saves me a phone call.
We have a deal to offer your client.

366
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,713
Client?

367
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,313
Shaughnessy.

368
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,358
- He's not my client.
- That's not what he said.

369
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,433
He's drunk most of the time. You can't
take anything he says very seriously.

370
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,990
We're taking what we think
he has to say very seriously.

371
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,435
Just out of curiosity...

372
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,750
...what kind of deal
were you gonna offer him?

373
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,230
- Curiosity?
- Yeah, mild.

374
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,150
Okay, if he were to cooperate, let us
know who signs his marching orders...

375
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,231
...we'd plead him down
to a lesser charge.

376
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,710
Unless the plaintiff decides
to drop the charges.

377
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,677
Then he would have no reason to talk.

378
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,116
Except the plaintiff has no reason
to do that. Right?

379
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,988
Let me tell you something, Sandy. The
Newport Group is Orange County's Enron.

380
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,276
You make this just a little
difficult for me...

381
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,510
...and I'll come down on you
as hard as I can.

382
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,069
- This must be a reelection year.
- Oh, spare me.

383
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,115
You and I have been friends for years.
That's why Caleb Nichol hired you.

384
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,636
It used to be, Sandy Cohen's moral
compass wouldn't point him anywhere...

385
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,792
...except the direction of truth.
No matter who he took down.

386
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,713
Spoken like a man
who's never been married.

387
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,719
I just can't hit it any better than that.

388
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,230
Good to see you again.

389
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,997
- Hey, man, where you been?
- Theresa's.

390
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,390
- Your parents say anything?
- No, I covered for you.

391
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,233
You shouldn't do this.
You're sleeping there? That's serious.

392
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,595
- I fell asleep.
- I heard about some scary guy...

393
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,796
...that showed up at school.
Was it Eddie?

394
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,234
- He came to talk.
- Yeah?

395
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,914
About how it's getting serious
between you and Theresa?

396
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,878
- You and Anna? You talk?
- Do not change the subject to me.

397
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,110
I'm powerless not to talk
about it. I tried.

398
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,350
She had a list of reasons
why she's leaving.

399
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,158
- Didn't make the cut?
- She's lying.

400
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,880
I want her to know that I'm sorry
I hurt her feelings.

401
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,873
But she doesn't have to do this.
She shouldn't be doing this.

402
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,237
- Then just tell her.
- Just tell her, huh?

403
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,675
Simple. Honest.
No wonder I never considered it.

404
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,355
Okay, fine. I'll tell her tonight.
Might have to have a little bubbly first.

405
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,509
A little <i>veritas in vino</i>,
know what I mean?

406
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,238
Hardly ever.

407
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,078
Coming.

408
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,434
Hey. Come in.

409
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,755
- How are you?
- Good. What's going on?

410
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,639
- Well, there's this party tonight, and...
- I heard.

411
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,072
Yeah, well, I thought
maybe you'd want to go.

412
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,357
I can't. I didn't really bring
any of my nice clothes with me.

413
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,559
Well, I have some options.

414
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:11,350
Hello? Hello? Hey, Joel.
Thanks for getting back to me.

415
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,071
No, actually, now's a perfect time.

416
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,432
- Come on. Smile for your father, Kiki.
- I'm smiling on the inside.

417
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,113
<i>Veritas in vino.</i>

418
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,197
Yeah. Then we have a deal?

419
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,715
Why spend a lot of money when
you can make a lot?

420
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,791
Yeah. Caleb'll be pleased.

421
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,873
Yes, Mr. McKuin, I'm fully aware.
We do what we must.

422
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,998
Theresa coming?

423
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,037
Nope. Marissa?

424
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,031
I doubt it.

425
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:50,037
Look, I get why you're doing what
you're doing, but she does really love you.

426
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,472
- I know. It's just...
- Yeah. The Oliver thing. I know.

427
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,073
It was messed up.

428
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,155
But, hey, she dated Luke for years.
You can't always trust her judgment.

429
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,793
But she has a good heart.

430
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,748
Not your typical back-yard barbecue.

431
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,639
Yeah, well, they never are.

432
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,753
You...

433
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,958
I had some help.

434
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,033
Coop.

435
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,754
- That's a nice one, sir.
- Right here, please. Eyes right here.

436
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:38,835
Come on, Seth. Get in the picture.
You are the future of the company.

437
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,956
There's something to look forward to.

438
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,032
You'll grow out of comic books
and grow into wanting to be rich.

439
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,275
No, I won't.

440
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,353
- Hey.
- Hi.

441
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,673
I just came to say goodbye.
My plane's leaving soon.

442
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,956
- You're really leaving.
- Yeah.

443
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,234
Well, you might not believe this,
but I'm gonna miss you.

444
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,595
What's more unbelievable
is that I'm gonna miss you.

445
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,398
Pretty unbelievable.

446
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,870
- Bye, Blanche.
- See you, Rose.

447
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,799
Have you seen Molly Miller's boob job?
They're huge.

448
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,758
Lois Robin's face-lift?

449
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,390
Diane Kahn totally had chin implants.

450
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,879
They have chin implants?

451
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,554
Oh, yeah. Chins are the new nose.
Haven't you heard?

452
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,110
- Hey, Anna. Theresa.
- Nice to meet you.

453
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,955
Came to say goodbye to Seth?

454
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,237
Yeah.

455
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,029
Could you give him this?

456
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,269
It's supposed to say everything
that I couldn't say.

457
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,839
But now that I'm here,
I just...

458
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,514
...can't say anything at all.
- Yeah. Yeah. Of course.

459
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,270
See you, Ryan.

460
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,835
Thanks for teaching me how to waltz.

461
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,993
Have the best life. You deserve it.

462
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,279
- Bye.
- Bye.

463
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,154
You look so hot.

464
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,710
Not here, Luke. Behave.

465
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,440
I know. It's just...

466
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,872
...your ass.

467
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,554
We do all right.
Excuse me, guys. Thanks.

468
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,190
I saw the DA today.
It didn't go what I would call "well."

469
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,079
I thought he was your friend.
You made deals all the time.

470
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,710
It's an election year. It seems you're
not too popular with the people.

471
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,155
That the best you could do?
I need to make my toast.

472
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,993
I'll make this go away,
but you'll have to give something up.

473
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,711
Joel McKuin needs to be the chief supplier
for the next big Newport Group contract.

474
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,156
You won't be buying wholesale,
but it'll work.

475
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,388
- I knew I could rely on you.
- Not if you were Man of the Century.

476
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,109
What's the matter, Sandy?
You cut deals for your clients all the time.

477
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:17,757
Yeah, well, usually, they're the ones
that have broken the law, not me.

478
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,515
Mr. Nichol, it's time for your speech.
Right this way.

479
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,278
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my pleasure...

480
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,159
- Hey, Jules.
- James.

481
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,790
Now, forgive me, this can't
possibly be happening, right?

482
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,636
- I'm crazy to even think it, right?
- Think what?

483
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:48,476
Okay, that's what I thought.
Because it would destroy Marissa.

484
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,793
We know she's been through enough.

485
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,475
Honestly, Jimmy, I don't know
what you're talking about.

486
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,394
- Now, Caleb's speaking.
- It really is a tremendous honor.

487
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,471
Few publications better represent...

488
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:05,519
...this great county of ours
than <i>Riviera Magazine.</i>

489
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,675
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna give Seth his letter.

490
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,877
Okay. I'll be here,
trying to spot the chin implants.

491
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,480
My story has its own cast of characters.

492
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:29,553
One doesn't become <i>Riviera</i> Man
of the Year without some help.

493
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,950
Where would I be without
my wonderful family?

494
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,350
My beautiful daughter Kirsten,
and my favorite...

495
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:38,798
Well, my only grandson, Seth.
Come join me.

496
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,872
- What are you doing here?
- I just want to talk. Can't you listen?

497
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,837
- Let's go somewhere and figure this out.
- I'm not going anywhere.

498
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,910
Stay the hell away from me. You're lucky
I don't kick your ass right here.

499
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,196
- Look, can we please just go?
- Let go!

500
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,951
What the hell is going on?

501
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,916
Why don't you leave
before the cops get here.

502
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,513
- You're dead!
- Right now.

503
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,468
Don't ever come home. You're dead.
You hear me? Get off me, man.

504
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,354
Oh, that's gonna be quite a shiner.
But, hey, they look good on you.

505
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,669
Yeah? Thanks.

506
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,479
I'm so sorry. About everything.

507
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,756
Oh, it's okay, sweetie. It's not your fault.

508
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:48,391
Hey, I heard there was a rumble in the
bedroom. I'm gonna go break it up.

509
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,193
You okay?

510
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,158
- I can't believe Anna didn't show.
- Actually...

511
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,679
- You're just giving me this now?
- I was a little distracted.

512
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,553
The ink's all smudged.
I can't even read it.

513
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,438
Is that a V or a Q?

514
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,318
Okay, here, look. Right there.

515
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,790
That says, "I love you." Then what
is that word? "Azerbaijan"? "Aztecs"?

516
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,439
- Aspirin.
- It says "aspirin"?

517
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,478
- You're giving me a headache.
- "Confucius"? What's this C-word?

518
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,789
- Confusing?
- "Confusing"?

519
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,952
No. You're confusing me.
What do you care what it says?

520
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,839
Anna couldn't even say goodbye.
She's leaving because of me.

521
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,070
- I don't want it to happen.
- What is going on?

522
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,556
Last week, you're on a coffee cart
declaring your eternal love for me.

523
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,678
Now you're all like,
"Anna's letter. I can't read it."

524
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:43,231
This isn't like that, okay? She's just my
friend, and I don't want her to leave.

525
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,352
Then go.

526
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,397
Stop her.

527
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,274
- So, what are you gonna do?
- I need to call Eddie.

528
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,000
Try and straighten everything out.

529
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,991
It's gonna be okay.

530
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,389
I'm sorry to interrupt. I need you to drive
me to the airport. I gotta stop Anna.

531
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,677
- You can't drive yourself?
- I've had three glasses of champagne.

532
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,115
You know how it goes
straight to my head. Please.

533
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,714
- You should go. He needs you.
- Thank you very much.

534
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,273
You're gonna be at the motel
when I get back?

535
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,510
I don't want you to be late.

536
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,315
Hey, Juju.

537
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,388
- I wondered if you'd ignore me all night.
- You seemed busy.

538
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,391
- Congratulations.
- Thanks for coming.

539
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,152
Can I drive you home?

540
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,957
- I can walk down the driveway.
- Can I call you?

541
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,398
Take you out on a real date?
Things have gotten a bit crazy.

542
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,757
Now, I know I didn't appreciate you.
I want to.

543
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,800
I want to make you feel appreciated.

544
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,916
Plan the perfect date, run it by me.
We'll see.

545
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,191
Come on, man. Her flight leaves soon.

546
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,913
I'm doing 75 in a 65, all right?

547
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,514
"I'm doing 75 in a..."
Everyone knows 80 is the new 75.

548
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,399
- What? Who talks like that?
- What is up with this a.c.?

549
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,710
My Jewfro is frizzing out.
I look like Screech.

550
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,189
- The a.c.'s fine.
- What is this music?

551
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,392
Do not insult Journey. All right?

552
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,509
- Hey.
- Hey.

553
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,672
How are you?

554
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:46,436
Just embarrassed. I can't believe it,
this huge fight at a fancy party.

555
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,398
Actually not the first time
that's happened.

556
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,790
Here. I'm not gonna have time
to get it dry-cleaned before I go.

557
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,679
Before you go?

558
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,470
I've been fooling myself thinking
this was gonna be easy.

559
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,278
I made a huge mess of everything, and...

560
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,955
...I have this whole life to figure out.
And so does Ryan.

561
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,199
So take care of him.

562
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,555
I'll see you.

563
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,749
I talked to my dad.
He told me what you did.

564
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,798
Obstructed justice.
Tampered with a witness.

565
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,752
So, what happens now?

566
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:41,118
My guess is, not much. Since it's an
election year, the DA can't afford to lose.

567
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,159
And without this star witness,
they don't really have a case.

568
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,715
And if you're gonna go
after the king, Caleb...

569
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,189
...then you had better know
you can kill the king.

570
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,430
I told you I didn't want you
to get involved.

571
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,309
- I do what's best for my family.
- I'd rather go to jail than be responsible...

572
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:59,996
...for you being mixed up in this,
getting into bed with my father.

573
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,234
I promise you, I'd rather send you to jail
than get into bed with your father.

574
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,715
You do something like this,
there's no going back.

575
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,509
Yeah. It's kind of like prom night.

576
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,875
Believe me.

577
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,998
If anybody's gonna be putting
you in handcuffs...

578
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,720
...it's gonna be me.

579
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,638
Anna!

580
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:00,148
- Anna, wait.
- Seth? Hold on.

581
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,875
Seth, what are you doing here?

582
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:09,592
Okay. Maybe it's just the champagne
talking, but I'm just gonna say it. Okay?

583
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,913
- Please do not leave because of me.
- What? What are you...?

584
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,071
You love me. I read it. And I get it. Okay?

585
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,279
And I'm so sorry if I did anything
to hurt your feelings. Or cause this.

586
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,908
But I don't want you to leave.
Okay? None of us do.

587
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,959
Seth, I love you as a friend.

588
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,276
- What?
- God, I love you as a friend.

589
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,715
That doesn't say "Azerbaijan"?

590
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:40,755
Look, I think you're an amazing guy.
A little self-absorbed, maybe, but great.

591
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,755
But, I mean, if there's one thing that
our relationship taught me, it's that...

592
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,354
...we don't have a lot of chemistry.

593
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,232
So you're not leaving because of me?

594
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,955
I'm leaving because I need to leave.

595
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,669
But who knows? Maybe one day,
we'll be perfect for each other.

596
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,197
I don't know.

597
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,718
I do know I have to go to Pittsburgh.

598
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,638
I'm Ionely, Seth. I thought
I could make this my home, but I can't.

599
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,509
Thanks for coming...

600
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,276
...and saying goodbye.

601
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,316
Anna, wait a second.

602
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,393
What am I gonna do without you?
Who will I play Jenga with?

603
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,757
You're so wise. All your sage wisdom.
What am I gonna do without that?

604
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,512
Confidence, Cohen.

605
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,389
Anna!

606
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,670
I'll be right back.

607
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,957
What if the girl I'm supposed to be with
just went back to Pittsburgh?

608
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,076
What if she went back to Chino?

609
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,196
Why would Anna go to Chino?

610
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,317
- I'm kidding. Come on.
- Nice one.

611
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,358
Well, at least we have each other.

612
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,030
Actually, I have Summer now.

613
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,670
But I'll put a little Seth-Ryan time
on the books.

614
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,513
- That's quality time.
- Thanks, buddy.

615
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,875
I could always hang out with Luke.

616
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,828
What do you think he's doing right now?

617
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,311
Discovering fire?

618
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,316
Hunting and gathering?

619
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:27,193
Shaving his chest with a Buck Knife?
You guys could do that together.

620
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,396
I do do that.
