1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:08,100
???

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:56,900
???

3
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:15,300
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com present</font>

4
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,500
He hasn't spoken
to us in days.

5
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,400
Well, us he can ignore.

6
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,100
When Ryan doesn't speak to Seth,
that's when I start to worry.

7
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,300
It's like he's turning
into an island.

8
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,500
Yeah, right in the path
of Hurricane Julie.

9
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,000
Ever since we got back
from Mexico,

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
things haven't been the same.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,500
Tell me about it.

12
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,900
I've been banned
from your house.

13
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,900
Your parents have been mad
at me before.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,700
It's never been this bad.

15
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,000
We're excluding her
from Thanksgiving.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,100
Well, when you send our kids
on a murder mission,

17
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,800
you get knocked off
the guest list.

18
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,400
House rules.

19
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,900
Hey, Summer, just calling to say
happy Thanksgiving.

20
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,000
Well, I use the term "happy"
loosely.

21
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,400
It's actually shaping up to be
kind of an awkward Thanksgiving,

22
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,800
filled with silent pauses
and lack of eye contact.

23
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,800
Ryan has taken the nonverbal
thing to a whole new level.

24
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
There have been times, say,
after he's told me

25
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,700
not to tell someone something,
and I did,

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,200
or when I came up with a stupid
plan and we got caught,

27
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,300
and/or had to be saved

28
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,600
Thing is, Ryan and I have never
been in a fight before,

29
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,800
but I got a feeling things
will blow over today.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,600
'Cause... they have to.

31
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,200
It's Thanksgiving.

32
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,000
It's Thanksgiving.

33
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,400
You just watch.

34
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,900
This family's going to come
together for the holidays.

35
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,400
That's what we Cohens do.

36
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,300
Hey.

37
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,400
Coffee?

38
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
Sure.

39
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,400
Should be ready any second.

40
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,000
Oh, I hate to miss
this spirited discussion,

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,300
but I got to take this.

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,800
Hello.

43
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,100
Uh-huh.

44
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,200
Where are you?

45
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,900
Okay, enough of this.

46
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,000
No more tip-toeing,

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,100
no more silences.

48
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,000
It is Thanksgiving
and this family is going

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
to get over what happened
and move on with their lives.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,300
I don't know if it's that easy.

51
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,700
No one said it was going
to be easy,

52
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,500
but this family
is going to work
together

53
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,600
and make Thanksgiving dinner.

54
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,800
You two, grocery store,
together.

55
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,700
I've got
to pick up Summer.

56
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,100
You can go before.

57
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,400
List, here.

58
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,900
And when you get back, we're
gonna cook this bird together.

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,600
Including you--
no surfing, no golf.

60
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,400
You got it.
I do have to go to the office.

61
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,000
Sandy.

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,500
But I'll only
be gone a few hours,

63
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,000
and when I'm back
I'm all yours.

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,200
Great. Now you can all change
and wash up,

65
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,600
but you report for duty
in one hour.

66
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,700
Ryan, are you going
to be okay?

67
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,200
'Cause if you can't put
your anger

68
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,500
about Volchok aside,
even for today,

69
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,200
then there's no point
to any of this.

70
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,500
No, I'm not angry, I...

71
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,500
I just wish he was dead,
that's all.

72
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,000
It's me.

73
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,600
Are you still there?

74
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,300
Yeah, I'm here.

75
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:51,400
<font color="#ffff00">Capture:QQ  
  sync:FRM@¹Ûº£ÎÀ</font>

76
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,800
Thanks for coming.

77
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,900
To be honest with you,
I didn't know where else to go.

78
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,300
Hitched a ride into town.

79
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,900
Slept on the beach
last night.

80
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,500
I'm not your friend.

81
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,800
I'm your lawyer,

82
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,300
and I'll help you
get through this,

83
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,300
but the less you talk,
the better, all right?

84
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,700
I brought you a bagel.

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,100
A bagel?

86
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,600
I asked for an egg-white omelet
and some cantaloupe.

87
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,200
Taylor, I said you could
hide out in my room

88
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,900
for a couple days.

89
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,800
I did not say
there will be
room service.

90
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,500
Seth, one day
when I'm no longer sleeping

91
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,400
under your bed,
you're going to miss me.

92
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,300
And when will that be?
'Cause you kind of made it sound

93
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,200
like this
was a temporary thing.

94
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,800
I know, I know.

95
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,600
You think it would healthier
for me to confront my fear

96
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,800
and face my mom.

97
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
More like Summer's
coming home,

98
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,900
and I was hoping
we could get it on up here.

99
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,500
You understand.

100
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,900
Right, of course.

101
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,700
You guys need alone time
together.

102
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,300
I mean, like you said,

103
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,400
your relationship is just
hanging by a thread.

104
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,100
I didn't say that.

105
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,000
Really?

106
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,100
You didn't?

107
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,100
Oh. I must have dreamt it.

108
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,100
You know, since
I've been on the run,

109
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,800
my dreams have
been so vivid.

110
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
Like last night,
I dreamed that Gerard Depardieu

111
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
and I were teammates
on <i>The Amazing Race.</i>

112
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,500
Wait, back up.

113
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,900
Is this about your trip
to Brown last week?

114
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,200
Did something happen
with Summer?

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,100
No, of course not.

116
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,400
No, she's still
the same old Summer.

117
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,500
She may not smell like
the same old Summer,

118
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,000
but inside she's...
she's still the same girl.

119
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,000
I wouldn't know.

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,600
I feel like we've barely spoken
in weeks.

121
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,000
Seth, you guys
are gonna be fine.

122
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Just think, she's on her way
here right now.

123
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,800
I don't think I'm coming.

124
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
Listen, I've been looking
forward to seeing you.

125
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,500
I just got back from Seattle
and I've got a lot to tell you.

126
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,000
Well, tell me now.

127
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,100
No, I want you hear.

128
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,200
It's Thanksgiving.

129
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,800
Exactly. Millions of turkey.

130
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,000
being senselessly slaughtered

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,700
so us Americans can get
even fatter?

132
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,100
I like turkey.

133
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,300
I know you do.

134
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,100
I just, I don't think I can
support this holiday, you know?

135
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,800
I think I'm just gonna
sit this one out.

136
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,000
Okay, you want to tell me
what's really going on?

137
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,800
Uh, I don't know.

138
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm just not up for it.

139
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,500
Is that a dog?

140
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,700
Hold on a second.

141
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,500
Kaitlin, what is, what is
that thing doing in my house?

142
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,100
Well, nothing now.

143
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,500
Although a few minutes ago
she kind of took

144
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,900
a tinkle
in your den.

145
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,900
I want you to get that thing
out of here.

146
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,300
I want you to take it back
wherever you got it.

147
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,400
Dude, I found her at the pier,
and I'm not taking her back.

148
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,000
She totally fits
in my purse.

149
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,300
Dude, does your mother know
that you have this thing?

150
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,300
Well, yesterday she almost
sucked her up in a vacuum.

151
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,000
I guess, to her, the dog
is invisible, like me.

152
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,900
Oh, by the way, I think
your Roberto's are cashed.

153
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You're sorry?

154
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,600
This was a $700 pair
of shoes.

155
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,000
Oh, I forgot to ask you.

156
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,200
How'd your conference go?

157
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,700
Thought so.

158
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,300
Sorry about that, sweetheart.

159
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,800
It's all right.

160
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,700
Dad, it sounds like
you're in the loony bin.

161
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,600
Sometimes I think I am.

162
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,000
You need me there, don't you?

163
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,200
Desperately.

164
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,400
All right, see you in six hours.

165
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,300
I love you.

166
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,700
You, too. Bye.

167
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,900
Crap!

168
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,100
 <i>I know it's Thanksgiving,</i>

169
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,500
but you're a private
investigator.

170
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,600
Julie.
Can't you find a guy
and eat turkey at the same time?

171
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,200
Call me back in five, will you?

172
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,200
Hi. Sorry.
Do you want a waffle?

173
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow down.

174
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,300
I've been trying
to talk to you

175
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,100
ever since I got back
from my trip.

176
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,000
Why don't we spend
the morning together?

177
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,800
We can go for a walk
on the beach.

178
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,800
Maybe without our cell phones.

179
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,500
No, Neil, I'm sorry.
I have to cook.
You have to cook?

180
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,800
I thought we were
going to the Cohens'
for dinner.

181
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,200
Well, we're not.

182
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,800
Kirsten's turkey
is always dry

183
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,400
and Sandy, with his
long boring speeches

184
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,500
about the importance
of family,

185
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,800
I'd just as soon
eat in.

186
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,500
There's nothing in there.

187
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,700
Then I should go
to the market.

188
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,100
Can I have
my cell phone, please?

189
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,100
Thank you.

190
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,500
We're gonna have to
talk eventually.

191
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,000
Yeah, yeah, after the holidays,
of course.

192
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,300
So, what's next?

193
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,000
Parsley.

194
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,700
Wow, this trip to
the grocery store

195
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,400
has been a real success.

196
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,400
I'm sure silent cart
pushing is exactly

197
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,300
what my mom envisioned
when she sent us here.

198
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,800
Well, what do you expect?

199
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,000
For me to get over
everything just because
we're buying parsley?

200
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,700
It's more than a garnish,
Ryan, it's a good omen.

201
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,800
Speaking of omens.

202
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,100
Julie.

203
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:17,900
Ryan.

204
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,100
Hello, Julie.

205
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,800
I wanted to thank you
for that travel tip.

206
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,900
Ensanada turned
out to be

207
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,000
the perfect vacation
spot for the Cohens.

208
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,300
We may get a time-share.

209
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,100
Save it, Seth.

210
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,900
I already got the lecture
from your dad.

211
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,300
Ryan, would you care to join me
in the samples?

212
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,200
I'll get the sweet potatoes.

213
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
We've got two types
of Gouda.

214
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,900
This is the Beemster,

215
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,200
and this is the Old Amsterdam.

216
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's delicious.

217
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,500
So the P.I. swears
he'll have a location
for Volchok by Monday.

218
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,200
What'll we do
until then?

219
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,200
Just, uh, wait, I guess.

220
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,800
I'll call you
in the morning,
I'll make a plan.

221
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,400
Until then,
act normal.

222
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:55,800
Thank you.

223
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,600
Hey, Sandy, I was just wondering
when you were going to be home

224
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,600
to help me with...

225
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,000
Oh, my God.

226
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,800
Taylor, I thought
you were in France.

227
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,700
In fact, what am I doing here
when <i>Gai Paris</i> beckons?

228
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,400
 <i>Au revoir.</i>

229
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,400
Hold on.

230
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,100
When a kid is stealing
stuffing in my kitchen,

231
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,800
that's usually a sign
that something's wrong.

232
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,300
I would talk to you, Mrs. Cohen,

233
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,700
but this is simply too private.

234
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,900
I'll make you a plate of food.

235
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,900
Living room?

236
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,500
Ryan, listen, the important
thing is Sandy can't suspect us.

237
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,000
He needs to feel
like we've moved on,
that we've let go.

238
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,800
Yeah, that's
going to be kind of hard.

239
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,000
He knows I haven't given up
on Volchok.

240
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,700
Kind of got into it
this morning.

241
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,400
Then you need to go
smooth things over.

242
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,200
Smile, apologize,
lie, whatever it takes.

243
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,200
Ryan, you want to get
this son of a bitch

244
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,600
just as badly as I do.

245
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,000
That's a really hard thing
to do

246
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,200
with Sandy Cohen watching
your every move.

247
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,800
Yeah.

248
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,700
I'll stop by his office
on my way back.

249
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,400
Oh, Ryan, one more thing.

250
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,500
Do you happen to know
how to cook a turkey?

251
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,400
Never mind.

252
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,700
You got married?

253
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,100
His name was Henri Michel,

254
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,200
and I met him outside
the Place des Voges.

255
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,000
He wooed me

256
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,500
for a few
whirlwind weeks,

257
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,500
and the next
thing I knew,

258
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,800
I was in his
family's chapel

259
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,300
in Burgundy, tipsy
off a 1953 Chateau Margaux

260
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,300
and vowing to love him
till death do us part.

261
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,000
I can't believe
this is happening.

262
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,600
Taylor, you're usually
so responsible.

263
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,900
Well, needless to say
it was <i>une erreur.</i>

264
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,800
Now he won't agree
to an annulment.

265
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,300
He's a stubborn man.

266
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,100
Sexy and well-endowed.

267
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,400
But stubborn.

268
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,600
So I came home...

269
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,400
and I'm just too afraid
to tell my mom now.

270
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,500
I've known your mom
for a long time.

271
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,800
She might be tough,
but she's your mom.

272
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,900
Which means she loves
you no matter what.

273
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,700
That's so sweet...
and totally wrong.

274
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,800
Don't you think
you're underestimating her?

275
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,600
No.

276
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,400
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

277
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,000
I just had the best idea.

278
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,200
You could tell her.

279
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,100
Now that we're
like sisters,

280
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,500
I'm sure you'd be happy to.
No, that's your job.

281
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,700
<i>Mon Dieu!</i>

282
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,200
 <i>Je suis tres désolée,</i>
 <i>mais j'ai peur.</i>

283
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,400
Okay...

284
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,700
I will talk to her,

285
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,300
but I am not doing
your dirty work.

286
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,300
I am just going to put her
in the right frame of mind.

287
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,300
Great, that's great.

288
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,900
She's in charge
of the Turkey Trot--

289
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,500
the prix fixe meal
over at the Yacht Club.

290
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,500
She'll be there
all afternoon.

291
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,800
No, no, I can't do it today.

292
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,300
I have a thousand things
to do, Taylor.

293
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,600
<i>Mon Dieu.</i>
 <i>Mon coeur est cass?..</i>

294
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,700
Okay, fine, I will talk
to her today,

295
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,200
but you're going to have
to help me cook.

296
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,000
Oh, Kirsten, I will be
the best sous chef ever.

297
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,400
You just watch.

298
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,500
Hey.
Hi.

299
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,300
Hey.

300
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,000
Uh, here,

301
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,600
I sprung for roses.

302
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,300
the cheapskate in me
wanted to get you carnations,

303
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,600
but it's a special occasion.

304
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,500
This?

305
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,200
Yeah, you're here, and not
just for a whirlwind

306
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
comic book intervention,
but for an actual visit.

307
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,800
Well, it's only
for three nights.

308
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,800
It's longer
than you think.

309
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,800
Uh-huh. Thanks, Greg.

310
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,300
So, I'm going to go
see the D.A.,

311
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,500
enter your guilty plea,

312
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,200
and hopefully we can
settle on a charge and
a sentence by tonight.

313
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,900
So I'll still be doing time?

314
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,700
For what you did?
Yeah, I'd say so.

315
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,600
That Seth kid said, um...

316
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,900
he said that
you would help me.

317
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,300
I am helping you.

318
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,000
Helping turn you over
to the authorities

319
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,100
so you can get the punishment
you deserve.

320
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,600
You made a lot
of mistakes.

321
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,400
But you turned yourself in,
and that was

322
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
the right thing
to do.

323
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,200
After a while, being in Mexico
and running all the time,

324
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,300
it all started to feel
like prison anyway.

325
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,100
That's guilt for you.

326
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,200
Follows you around.

327
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,700
But you're here now.

328
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,600
So we'll find
a hotel room for you

329
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,800
While I work things
out with Otis.

330
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,800
I really appreciate this.

331
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,600
Well, listen, the sooner
you're off the street,

332
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,500
the sooner Ryan can
start his life again.

333
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,400
Yeah, I just want it all
to be over.

334
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,600
Oh, me, too.

335
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,300
You have no idea.

336
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,500
Excuse me, do you know
where Sandy Cohen's office is?

337
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,000
Yeah, it's inside
to the left.

338
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,900
But you just
missed him.

339
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,600
Oh, I did?

340
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,000
Yeah, he just left
with a client.

341
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Poor guy's working
on Thanksgiving.

342
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,900
No, no, no, no, no, Kirsten.

343
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,100
Here, let me.

344
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,400
You want to just lightly
kiss the bird.

345
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,200
Like so.
I see.

346
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,500
Oh, hi, Ryan.
Did you know Taylor
was back in town?

347
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,500
Hello, Ryan.

348
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,100
I know, you must be
confused as to why
I'm here, but in time...

349
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,100
Do you know where Sandy is?

350
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,200
He called
a while ago.

351
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,800
He said he had
some errands to run.
Did he say where he was going?

352
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,600
No. Is everything okay?
Yeah, it's fine.
I'll be back later.

353
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,900
I was hoping that
you'd help with dinner.

354
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,100
Okay, but only
for a little while.

355
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,000
My dad needs me back
in crazy town.

356
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,100
I just want you to witness
the magic of a Cohen
family Thanksgiving.

357
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,700
Even if only for
a few moments.

358
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,200
All right.

359
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,700
Hey, Ryan, look who showed up.
Hi.

360
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,000
Hey, Atwood.

361
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,800
See, there's magic everywhere.

362
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,100
Gourds, it needs gourds.

363
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,400
Hi, guys.

364
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,700
Hi, Summer.

365
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,600
Oh, it's good
to see you.
You, too.

366
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,100
Welcome home.

367
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,200
Oh, did you bathe
in a creek?

368
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,000
Taylor, what are
you doing out?

369
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,800
Oh, um, I came clean
to your mom,

370
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,400
and now I'm helping her
through Thanksgiving.

371
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,000
Taylor...

372
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,500
now that Seth
and Summer are here,

373
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,800
why don't they
take over

374
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,900
and we'll go talk
to your mother.

375
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,300
You're taking on
Veronica Townsend?

376
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,600
It's a death wish.

377
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,000
Why don't you just
baste the turkey.

378
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,200
But just very lightly

379
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,900
with the little brush thing

380
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,300
and not the baster.
Okay.

381
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,700
All right.
Okay.

382
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,700
Gosh, I haven't been
in this house in so long.

383
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,000
Well, the house
misses you-- so do I.

384
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,400
In fact, upstairs has
been asking for you.

385
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,600
Oh, really?
Mm-hmm.

386
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,400
Well, I got to get back
to my dad's house.

387
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,900
Give me five minutes.

388
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,300
Promise?

389
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,400
Keep me honest.

390
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,300
Ten.

391
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,900
How's dinner coming?

392
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,600
Fantastic. You wouldn't
happen to know

393
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,000
how to cook a turkey,
would you?

394
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,700
You've never
cooked a turkey?

395
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,300
Well, Jimmy always did it.

396
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,400
And after we broke up,
then we ended up at the Cohens'.

397
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,700
Right. And the reason we're
not going there is...?

398
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,600
Get that, will you?

399
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,200
Hey, Ryan.
Hey. Is Julie home?

400
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,100
She is, but I'd rather you
didn't bother her right now.

401
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,700
I just need a
minute of her time.

402
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,100
Yeah, I've been saying
the same thing for six months.

403
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,900
Maybe you can talk
to her after the holiday.

404
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,000
I... don't think

405
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,900
you really understand
what's going on here.

406
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,000
No, you're right, I don't.

407
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,600
I don't understand
all the phone calls.

408
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
I don't understand why we're not

409
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,900
having dinner
with your family tonight.

410
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
All I do know is that

411
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,900
I was once very excited about
my life with this woman,

412
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,900
and it all seems to be
disappearing right now.

413
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,100
I get it. I'm sorry.

414
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,800
Tell your family I say
happy Thanksgiving.

415
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,600
I said burgundy candles,
not orange.

416
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,800
Now, you go get them,
or I'll send a 911 page

417
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,000
to my guy at the INS.

418
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,700
Okay, off you go.

419
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,400
Are you sure you don't
want to come with me?

420
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,500
No, no, no. My stomach's kind of
doing that flip-floppy thing

421
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,200
it does every
time I see her.

422
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,700
Kirsten Cohen, what a surprise.

423
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,000
Have you been doing Pilates?
You look thin.

424
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,300
And I love your hair.

425
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,700
Thanks, Veronica.

426
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,300
Actually, I just
came by to help.

427
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,000
Oh, well, you can
help me with the candles.

428
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,800
So, this is your first
holiday without Taylor.

429
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,000
That must be
hard for you.

430
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,900
It is.

431
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,600
You know, I tell my clients
that I'm a mother first

432
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,300
and a sports agent second.

433
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,500
Uh, could you make
those a little bit

434
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,800
more parallel, like...?

435
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:36,900
No, just...

436
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,500
Maybe I should just do it.

437
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,200
I feel the same way
about being a mom.

438
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,500
You have to love your children
no matter what they do.

439
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,200
Even if they disappoint you.

440
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,700
Of course, and you would know.

441
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,700
You know, with the shooting
and the car accident,

442
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,100
and Seth burning down

443
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,200
a Newport group, and...

444
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,500
Actually, I was talking
about you and Taylor.

445
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,600
Right.

446
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,600
And I love Taylor
unconditionally.

447
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,500
You know, a wise woman once
said, if you love till it hurts,

448
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
there can be no more hurt,
but only more love.

449
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,900
You know who said that?

450
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,000
<i>The</i> mother.

451
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,100
Mother Teresa.

452
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,400
Oh, my God, Taylor?

453
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,500
What are you doing here?

454
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,900
Mom, I need to
talk to you.

455
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,700
I'm gonna leave
you two alone.

456
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,800
You'll be fine.

457
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,600
We only have
a few minutes together.

458
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,800
You sure you have to do yoga?

459
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,000
I've been on a plane all day.

460
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,200
I'm trying to reverse
the blood flow.

461
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,500
Fresh oxygen to the brain

462
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,700
gives you clarity
and peace of mind.

463
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,600
I still can't believe you had
no reaction to my tattoo.

464
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,800
I had a reaction-- I told you
to get that thing removed.

465
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,300
Yeah, I'll get
it removed.

466
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,900
Did it hurt?

467
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,500
Whatever. I was
with my Marine buds.

468
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,600
I barely felt a thing.

469
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,500
I bet you cried.

470
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,600
Like a baby.

471
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,400
Glad you're home.

472
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,700
Me, too.

473
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,800
What's wrong?

474
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,900
I just, I get upset
when I think about...

475
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,100
all of the food

476
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,600
that the average American
consumes during Thanksgiving,

477
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,000
when so many
people go without.

478
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,100
Huh?
We need to do
something.

479
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,500
We got to go.
Got to go somewhere.

480
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,900
Go? Go where?

481
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,600
The soup kitchen-- we're
gonna feed the homeless.

482
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,300
Do we have to?

483
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,100
We're already feeding Ryan,
and he was homeless once.

484
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,700
Hey, you can go
or you can stay.

485
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,300
Summer! How you doing?

486
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,800
Better than the
2.8 billion people

487
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,700
living below the
poverty level.

488
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,400
Are you okay with
that statistic, Mr. Cohen?

489
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,100
I don't think so.
That's why I have to go.

490
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,800
Who knew,
out of all you kids,

491
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,800
she'd turn out to be
the young Sandy Cohen?

492
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,100
Had to rub off on someone.
We'll be back soon.

493
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,900
Hey, honey.

494
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,500
You know, I thought
we were gonna be

495
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,100
having dinner as a family,
and here I am,

496
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,000
being driven crazy
by Taylor Townsend.

497
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I got news.

498
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,600
Volchok came to see me today.

499
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,700
Volchok Volchok?

500
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,600
He turned himself in.

501
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,400
I put him in a hotel

502
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,000
while Otis finishes
his paperwork.

503
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,600
I figure we'll tell
Ryan after the holiday.

504
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,200
After he's
already in jail.

505
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,200
So he can't
get at him.

506
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,000
Well, yeah, the thought
did cross my mind.

507
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,500
So don't bother
asking me where he is,

508
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,600
'cause I'm not gonna tell you.

509
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,100
Look, you stop me from
going after him-- that I get.

510
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:17,900
But to defend him?

511
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,600
I'm not defending
him, Ryan.

512
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,800
I'm negotiating the
terms of his surrender.

513
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,400
And he's gonna get every
bit of what he deserves.

514
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,600
Ryan, Sandy and I

515
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,400
would only do
what's best for you.

516
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,900
Want to do what's
in my best interest?

517
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,000
Always.

518
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,500
Leave me alone.

519
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,200
Ryan.

520
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,000
???

521
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:51,700
Hey.

522
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,400
Friends of
Volchok, right?

523
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,300
Used to be.

524
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,200
No one's seen Volchok
in months.

525
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,000
Don't know where he is.

526
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,600
Well, he's back in town.

527
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,300
I need to find out
where he's staying.

528
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,600
I don't know.

529
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,800
He called anyone,
it was probably Heather.

530
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,500
You got her number?

531
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,300
Haven't talked to her.

532
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,100
Might not be in town.

533
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,400
I'm gonna need
that number.

534
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,400
Hey.

535
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,900
Just for the record,

536
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,600
that night...
I don't want to
talk about it.

537
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,800
Look, the first stoplight,
I jumped out,

538
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,300
and I tried to find help,
and when I got back

539
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,100
to the car,
Volchok was gone.

540
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,100
Just needed you to know that.

541
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,000
And I just need
to find the guy.

542
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,800
Look, I told you on the phone,

543
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,400
I don't know
where he is.

544
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,200
He must've called you, told
you he was coming back.

545
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,800
He thinks that I'm gone, too.

546
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,000
And I was.

547
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,400
I'm only home to see
my mom for Thanksgiving.

548
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,400
I really shouldn't even
be talking to you.

549
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,300
I'm not gonna call
the cops on you.

550
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
You know, I spoke to him
a few months after the accident,

551
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,400
and... he sounded
pretty messed up.

552
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,000
Good.

553
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,700
Thanks for
meeting me.
Look...

554
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,400
maybe you should

555
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,400
try to put it behind you.

556
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,200
Just let him go.

557
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,800
Good advice.

558
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,800
Hello.

559
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,100
Any luck.

560
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:25,900
No.

561
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,700
I've been to the bait shop,
the diner.

562
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,900
Can't find him anywhere.

563
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,200
Oh, it just feels strange to be
cooking with all this going on.

564
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,600
Maybe we should call dinner off.

565
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,300
No, keep it going.

566
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,400
I got another idea
where he might be.

567
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,800
Well, call me as soon as you...

568
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,000
Uh, I-I got to go.

569
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,500
What happened?

570
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,300
She called me
irresponsible and stupid.

571
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,400
And then she said

572
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,800
that I would never
be truly thin,

573
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,500
because I have
a naturally large thorax.

574
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,400
Oh, Taylor, that's awful.

575
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,500
And the worst part is--
oh, my God.

576
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,400
These are like cardboard.

577
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,200
You're gonna want
to add some cream.

578
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,900
You know,
the worst part is,

579
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,700
she said I'm no longer
welcome in her house.

580
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,500
I am <i>le vagabond.</i>

581
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,600
You can stay here.

582
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,000
Forever?

583
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,800
Well, no.

584
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,100
For-for one night.

585
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,200
But we'll find somewhere
for you to stay.

586
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,200
Thank you, Kiki.

587
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,500
And I am so sorry that after
all you've done for me,

588
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,800
I abandoned ship
during the crucial hour

589
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,200
before Thanksgiving.

590
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,400
Now, let's see how
you're doing with those pies.

591
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,600
Did you smash the pecans finely,
like I told you to?

592
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,100
I skipped the pecan pie.

593
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,600
You skipped the pecan...?

594
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,500
Well, one pumpkin
will be fine.

595
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,200
There's only five of us.

596
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,300
You may want to rethink that.

597
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,600
We invited over some friends.

598
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,500
Love the Cohen open-door policy.

599
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,500
These aren't your friends.

600
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,800
We were trying to help
out at the soup kitchen,

601
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,800
and apparently they said
they had enough volunteers,

602
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,200
like such a thing exists.

603
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,500
Uh, just follow me
to the family room.

604
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,700
I really need to
use your toilet.

605
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,500
Oh, it's the first
one on the left.

606
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,200
Take these matches.

607
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,800
I'm next.
All right.

608
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,200
You're next.

609
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,200
Sorry.

610
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,400
They can't stay.

611
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,600
Well, I can't
tell them to go.

612
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,000
Summer will have
a nervous breakdown.

613
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,900
She's hanging by a thread.

614
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,100
You know, I used
to volunteer at the Y,

615
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,300
teaching personal hygiene.

616
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,300
So I could just run through
the basics with them.

617
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,700
Unfortunately, it means
that I wouldn't be able

618
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,500
to help you
in here.
Really, that sounds great.

619
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,300
Okay.

620
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,300
They stay,

621
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,500
you keep them
in one place,

622
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,800
you keep them occupied.

623
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,300
Okay.

624
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,700
Who here has not seen...

625
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,400
 <i>Battlestar Galactica,</i>
 <i>season one?</i>

626
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,500
I missed the
season finale.

627
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,300
???  That's okay.

628
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,500
Don't worry, Kiki,
I got your back.

629
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,300
digest the whole
thing, though.

630
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:52,800
Who here is a space...

631
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,700
Julie.

632
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,200
I thought you weren't
speaking to me.

633
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,900
I'm not calling to make peace.

634
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,100
I'm looking for Ryan.

635
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,000
Ryan?

636
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,800
You told me to stay
away from him, remember?

637
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,800
Oh, come on.

638
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,000
He called you as soon as

639
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,200
he found out I had
Volchok in custody.

640
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,700
Volchok is in custody?

641
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,500
So you really didn't know, huh?

642
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,100
No, no, I didn't.

643
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,000
Yeah
He turned himself
in this morning.

644
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,100
I already spoke to the D.A.

645
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,000
It should be a done deal
by tonight.

646
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,200
So it-it's really over.

647
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,400
I sure as hell hope so.

648
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,400
Julie? Julie?

649
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,400
Mom, are you okay?

650
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,800
I don't know.

651
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,200
Well, do you want
to lay down or something?

652
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,100
Do I want to lay in the dark

653
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,000
with nothing but my thoughts
to distract me?

654
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,900
No, Kaitlin, that is not
what I want to do.

655
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Okay.

656
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,400
Never mind.

657
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,200
I'll just go find my dog.

658
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,500
She's having
a meltdown.

659
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,800
Good luck.

660
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,800
Julie,

661
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,700
you look pale.

662
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,900
Are you all right?
I'm fine.

663
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,300
I have a turkey to cook,
potatoes to mash,

664
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,800
and that's all
I have to think about.

665
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,500
Just... just think
about the task at hand.

666
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,100
Will you get out of here?
You're in the way.

667
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,600
I have to baste a turkey.

668
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,500
<i>Nobody registered here</i>by that name.

669
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,700
Close, but he's not here.

670
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,600
So I'll keep looking.

671
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,100
Ah, why don't you
come with me?

672
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,400
Yeah? So you can take me home,
give me one of your lectures?

673
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,100
Oh, we're beyond all that.

674
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,800
All right, so what
are you doing here?

675
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,200
Why don't you find out?

676
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,500
Come on.

677
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,700
There aren't enough chairs.
Darryl needs a chair.

678
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,800
Summer, can
we talk...

679
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,800
Hey.

680
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,200
I'm just gonna make
a seating area

681
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,500
out of cushions
on the floor.

682
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,600
Summer, we need to talk.

683
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,600
I can't talk, I have
to mash these potatoes.

684
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,500
Hand me the cream.
No.

685
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,900
No more distraction tactics.

686
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,600
You and I both know
what's going on here.

687
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,800
Now these are ruined.

688
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,100
I'm going back
to the store.

689
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,700
You wouldn't happen to have
any baking soda, would you?

690
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,600
Kaitlin, get that dog
out of my house right now,

691
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,700
or, so help me God,
I will have it put to sleep.

692
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,100
God, you would,
wouldn't you?

693
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,500
Kaitlin, where
are you going?

694
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,700
To the Cohens'.

695
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,800
They don't hate the whole
family, Mom, just you.

696
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,700
Fine!

697
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,700
Don't come
crying to me

698
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,500
when Kirsten's turkey
tastes like rubber.

699
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,100
Julie. Julie!

700
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,100
Where are my keys?

701
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,500
Julie, listen to me.

702
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,200
Listen to me!

703
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,100
I love you, but you
are acting insane.

704
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,600
I'm not insane, okay?

705
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,300
What's insane is
how I used to be,

706
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,600
when all I would do is hang
out with my best friend,

707
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,200
and go tanning with
her and go shopping

708
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,200
and braid her hair

709
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,900
and talk to her
on the phone...
Summer, stop.

710
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,100
Let's be honest for a sec--
that's what this is all about.

711
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,600
Marissa-- it's
all about her.

712
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,400
You got to stop running away
and let yourself grieve.

713
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,000
My keys.
Stop running
away from me.

714
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,700
<i>I'm not running away,</i>

715
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,100
I just didn't realize
how late it was.

716
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,000
My dad's probably
totally freaking out.

717
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,300
I'm sorry I said it.

718
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,200
Just please don't go.

719
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,600
You're the one
who walked away, Neil.

720
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,600
You had
the affair, remember?

721
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,200
Nothing happened
with Gloria and me.

722
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,800
I told you, I needed
somebody to talk to.

723
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,700
Well, you can talk to her
all you want now.

724
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,300
When I get back,
I want you out of this house.

725
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,100
It's my house.

726
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,500
We'll see about that.

727
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,600
Bye, Neil.

728
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,600
Bye.

729
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,500
He's in there.

730
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,500
Otis said he needs some
time to file the charges,

731
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,800
so I put him up here.

732
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,100
Room 102.

733
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,900
If this is some kind of dare,
I'm gonna take it.

734
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,800
I trust you.

735
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,100
Been waiting a long time
for this, I bet.

736
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,100
So what are you waiting for?

737
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,600
You just drove away!

738
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,700
You just left
her there!

739
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,900
Do it! Kill me!

740
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,800
I just want it
to be over, okay?!

741
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,800
I don't care anymore!

742
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,000
I just want it
to be over.

743
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,500
I just want it
to be over.

744
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,800
They're still
in there?
Yeah.

745
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,500
Maybe we
should go in.
No, give ???

746
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,700
You didn't try to help.

747
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,300
You didn't even stop.

748
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,500
I got scared.

749
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,400
I freaked, I, um...

750
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,900
And she died.

751
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,400
On the side of the road.

752
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,200
I think about
that night every day.

753
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,500
That's all
I think about.

754
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,300
I wish I could take it back.

755
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,700
I don't want to hear
about how bad you feel.

756
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,800
Tell me why you did it.

757
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,500
Does it matter?

758
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,500
It matters to me.

759
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,300
I don't know.

760
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,600
Okay.

761
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,200
I mean...
I was coming after you.

762
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,300
You got the girl.

763
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,600
I didn't, and that was
hard for me to handle.

764
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,400
I just...

765
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,500
I wanted you to pull over.

766
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,500
And it all just...
It got out of control.

767
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,300
So what?

768
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,300
It was all an accident?

769
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,300
Mm-hmm.

770
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,700
A mistake?

771
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,500
I know that doesn't
change anything.

772
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,300
So if you want to finish this...

773
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,300
I'm not going to fight back.

774
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,800
I'm not doing you any favors.

775
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,200
You have to live
with what you did.

776
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,100
It's over.

777
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,100
I'm proud of you.

778
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,800
I'm sorry.

779
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,500
You hungry?

780
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,600
Starving.

781
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,700
Well, let's go.

782
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,300
Hold it, you got this?
We'll take him in.

783
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,800
Call you after I'm done. 

784
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,400
All right, thanks.

785
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,200
Hey.

786
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,400
Hey

787
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,300
Where's my dad?

788
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,200
Gone.

789
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,800
Kaitlin?

790
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,300
Gone.

791
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,700
We can't go on like this
anymore, can we?

792
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,600
No.

793
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,200
I just got her
voicemail again.

794
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,400
I'm going to
go over there.
I don't think ???

795
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,000
In fact, I am turning
your ringer off.

796
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,000
Don't.
My girlfriend's freaking out.

797
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,300
That's exactly
what she should be doing.

798
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,500
Seth, she needs to face
what happened on her own

799
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,200
before you can
help her with it.

800
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,600
Hey, you guys
your mom

801
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,700
says to get ready
for dinner.
Okay.

802
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,700
You want to
cut the bird?

803
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,000
I'm hungry.
Um... Darl,

804
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,500
we're going to wait for
the rest of the family.

805
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,300
We're here.

806
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,800
Oh, finally.

807
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,300
Are you okay?

808
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,900
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.

809
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,200
Glad you're home.

810
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,000
Honey,

811
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,300
who, uh, who are these
gentlemen at the table?

812
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,000
It's a long story, Dad.

813
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,400
Could you pass the gravy?

814
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,400
Yeah, sure, buddy.

815
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,400
Hey.

816
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,800
Didn't I defend you a couple
of years ago for a B&E?

817
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,400
Yeah.

818
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,600
Now I remember.

819
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,000
I called you crazy eyebrow man.

820
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,100
Well, I'll take that as a compliment.

821
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,400
An old client of mine,

822
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,100
how do you like that?

823
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,000
Yeah, it's
pretty wild, Dad.

824
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,100
You want to hear wild?

825
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,600
I am

826
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,400
ninety percent sure

827
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,000
that's my dog.

828
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,900
Okay, there is no way
that this is your dog.

829
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,000
This is little Julie.

830
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,100
Uh-uh.

831
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,900
That's Savage.

832
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,100
Baby.

833
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,700
I been looking everywhere for you.

834
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,000
Come here.

835
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,800
Oh.
Okay, this
cannot be happening.

836
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,100
The Lord giveth
and he taketh away.

837
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,100
Job 1:21.

838
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,400
Oh, but I'm
no longer religious.

839
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,900
But as a child, I went
to Bible school

840
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,900
and then all
those quotes

841
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,900
just kind of, grr, stuck with me

842
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,900
???with meIt

843
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,700
???is so awesome.

844
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,100
Isn't it though?

845
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,200
Hey, it's me.

846
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,400
I'm heading back to Providence.

847
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,700
Look, everything
you said was true,

848
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,700
and I need to deal with it,
but I need to do it on my own.

849
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,500
I'm sorry I am such a mess.

850
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,500
It's just... I miss my friend.

851
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,500
But I'll call you as soon as
I get my head screwed on, okay.

852
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,100
I love you.

853
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,300
I left a message.

854
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,400
I know I didn't like Seth
when I first met him,

855
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,900
but I got to admit
he's grown on me.

856
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,500
I think you two are
going to be fine.

857
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,900
Thanks for seeing me off.

858
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,400
Of course.

859
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,300
It's so crazy.

860
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,700
To think the next
time you come home,

861
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,400
I might not be
living here.

862
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,500
Dad, are you going
to take that job in Seattle?

863
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,800
Well, the offer came
at the perfect time.

864
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,700
When the hospital is famous
for being wonderfully quirky,

865
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,800
it's called
Seattle Grace.

866
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,400
Is the stepmonster
going with you?

867
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,900
No, she'll visit.

868
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,700
But we'll take it
slow, I promise.

869
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,400
I'm really sorry
that you and Julie broke up.

870
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,600
Yeah, it's not the
Thanksgiving that I had in mind.

871
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,100
It's too bad

872
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,800
because I think that you
and I could both use it.

873
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,000
You know, I could
take a later flight.

874
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,300
Really?

875
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,900
Yeah, it's not too late
to have Thanksgiving.

876
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,600
What'd you have in mind?

877
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,000
I love Chili's.

878
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,400
You and me both, Dad.

879
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,000
Are we expecting somebody? 

880
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,000
I invited a few of my
cousins over.

881
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,400
I hope that's cool.

882
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,500
That's cool. I'll...

883
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,400
I'll handle it.

884
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,100
Hi.

885
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,600
Julie, whatever it is,
it'll have to wait.

886
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,800
We're having
Thanksgiving.

887
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,400
I just wanted
to tell you that I'm sorry.

888
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,500
I don't think I've ever
heard you say that before.

889
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,200
I don't think
I ever meant it.

890
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,800
Well, come on in.

891
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,200
Sandy, why don't you
pull out a chair.

892
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,800
No, um...

893
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,400
Go ahead.

894
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,800
Tell me about her.

895
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,800
What?

896
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,900
Anything; just...
tell me about her.

897
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,000
I remember the first
time I saw her.

898
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,600
She was, uh...

899
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,900
She was wearing this
white top thing,

900
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,700
and I think she
had jeans on.

901
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,100
She was standing at the
bottom of the driveway.

902
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,300
And I thought...

903
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,200
Well, I thought she
was really hot.

904
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,700
Really hot.

905
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,600
And she gave me this smile.

906
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,100
It was a beautiful smile.

907
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,800
It's a nice smile.

908
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,600
And I don't know,
we started talking,
maybe smoked

909
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,800
a cigarette or two.
I'm a rebellious child.
