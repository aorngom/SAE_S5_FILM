3
00:00:03,365 --> 00:00:05,304
<i>It occurred to me that maybe</i>

4
00:00:05,334 --> 00:00:07,792
<i>- I don't want you to think</i>

<i>- You're my guest.</i>

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,310
<i>Something happened to</i>

7
00:00:12,342 --> 00:00:14,424
<i>that you were one of the</i>

8
00:00:14,454 --> 00:00:16,542
<i>- Ed proposed to me.</i>
<i>- Good for you.</i>

9
00:00:16,695 --> 00:00:18,436
<i>Well, I haven't</i>
<i>answered him yet.</i>

10
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:20,410
<i>- Do you want to talk about it?</i>
<i>- About what?</i>

11
00:00:20,444 --> 00:00:23,063
<i>- About what happened in there.</i>
<i>- A lot of things happened in there.</i>

12
00:00:23,094 --> 00:00:26,256
<i>It was a moment, Lizzie.</i>
<i>Does it have to mean everything?</i>

13
00:00:26,454 --> 00:00:30,097
<i>- There's really nothing</i>
<i>between us now but silence.</i>
<i>- And a child.</i>

14
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:34,571
<i>This is the most uncomplicated</i>
<i>I've felt in a long time.</i>

15
00:00:34,976 --> 00:00:36,952
<i>There'll always be</i>
<i>a job for you here.</i>

16
00:00:37,185 --> 00:00:39,532
<i>I don't think I'll ever</i>
<i>be able to go in there.</i>

17
00:00:39,546 --> 00:00:41,262
<i>Now if you're not gonna</i>
<i>take the injured guy,</i>

18
00:00:41,297 --> 00:00:43,772
<i>you're not gonna take the girl,</i>
<i>take Nancy. She's the oldest.</i>

19
00:00:43,807 --> 00:00:46,361
<i>- That's gonna win you points out there.</i>
<i>- Showtime, lady.</i>

20
00:00:46,398 --> 00:00:48,222
<i>First she brings the stuff back,</i>
<i>hands it off at the door,</i>

21
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:49,970
<i>- then we let her go.</i>
<i>- No! My baby!</i>

22
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:51,732
<i>You're gonna be fine!</i>
<i>You're gonna be fine!</i>

23
00:00:51,768 --> 00:00:53,242
<i>No!</i>

24
00:00:53,495 --> 00:00:55,822
<i>- What is happening?</i>
<i>- Let me go, please!</i>

25
00:00:56,016 --> 00:00:58,210
<i>It's okay. They've got her.</i>
<i>They've got her.</i>

<i>Hour 4 - 6:02 PM</i>

27
00:01:35,075 --> 00:01:36,501
Mrs. Hale,

28
00:01:36,795 --> 00:01:38,641
I know how difficult
this is for you.

29
00:01:38,745 --> 00:01:41,153
But if you could
just try and focus.

30
00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:43,551
His eyes are a little
more nazi germany,

31
00:01:43,558 --> 00:01:46,260
but from what I can stand to recall
about him, it's a good likeness.

32
00:01:46,295 --> 00:01:48,192
Thank you.
The more we know about him,

33
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,662
the easier it'll be for us to
get your daughter out of there.

34
00:01:50,696 --> 00:01:53,341
What else can you tell me
about the other people inside?

35
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:54,753
There's the two gunmen, the

36
00:01:55,005 --> 00:01:57,952
- security guard, uh...
- Yes, you told us that earlier.

37
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:02,801
- There's a police officer.
- There's a cop inside?

38
00:02:02,828 --> 00:02:05,673
Yeah, contact the five
nearest police stations.

39
00:02:05,686 --> 00:02:08,293
Have them radio all detectives,
call every cell.

40
00:02:08,537 --> 00:02:10,183
Fax me a list of nonresponders.

41
00:02:10,516 --> 00:02:13,291
It won't be long before they
figure out I'm in here.

42
00:02:13,626 --> 00:02:15,253
They'll use me to help.

43
00:02:15,527 --> 00:02:17,833
Do you think that my
mother's still out there?

44
00:02:18,787 --> 00:02:21,830
Now what can you tell us about the
other people in there, Mrs. Hale?

45
00:02:21,865 --> 00:02:24,960
There was a doctor. He had on,
you know, he was wearing all that...

46
00:02:24,998 --> 00:02:27,601
- all that... that blue.
- John, check with the local hospitals.

47
00:02:27,636 --> 00:02:29,931
Find out who's missed
surgeries or rounds. Go.

48
00:02:30,145 --> 00:02:32,242
Oh, and he's in there
with his girlfriend.

49
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:34,853
I can't.

50
00:02:35,346 --> 00:02:37,232
No one else is eating.

51
00:02:38,377 --> 00:02:41,613
- I can't, right?
- It's Friday night.

52
00:02:43,216 --> 00:02:47,530
My parents will be expecting us
both for Shabbat dinner soon.

53
00:02:47,886 --> 00:02:49,840
And when we don't show...

54
00:02:54,766 --> 00:02:56,940
Looking to I.D. the doctor now.

55
00:02:57,648 --> 00:02:58,812
No.

56
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:03,443
No, I told you. He looks like 
he's 12 years old. I...

57
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:08,563
Wait, that's him.
Yeah, that's him.

58
00:03:08,835 --> 00:03:10,843
- Jeremy Kates with a "K."
- Yes.

59
00:03:11,027 --> 00:03:12,601
- Find his family.
- Got it.

60
00:03:12,647 --> 00:03:14,642
Do you think mom knows by now?

61
00:03:15,076 --> 00:03:16,943
She'll be all right.

62
00:03:18,728 --> 00:03:22,202
- Do you think she's out there?
- This picture's a few years old.

63
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,002
It'll do just fine, Mrs. Jones.

64
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,620
What do you need it for? 
Shouldn't you be concentrating 
on the robbers?

65
00:03:27,657 --> 00:03:30,731
We're building psychological profiles
of everyone inside the bank.

66
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:32,303
We need to get a
complete landscape

67
00:03:32,336 --> 00:03:34,410
of all the personalities that
we'll be dealing with in there.

68
00:03:34,446 --> 00:03:36,540
- Personalities?
- How we get your husband

69
00:03:36,596 --> 00:03:37,972
and daughter out of there

70
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:40,751
depends as much on who the
hostages are and how they behave

71
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,392
as on the robbers.

72
00:03:44,235 --> 00:03:46,281
Hey, you think he'd
let me bum a smoke?

73
00:03:47,057 --> 00:03:48,871
I doubt it.

74
00:03:49,158 --> 00:03:50,643
Tom Mitchell, security guard.

75
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,442
Got his wife on the phone.
Says she's too sick to come down.

76
00:03:53,476 --> 00:03:55,480
My wife made me quit
five years ago.

77
00:03:55,686 --> 00:03:58,712
She'd probably excuse anything
under these circumstances.

78
00:03:58,908 --> 00:04:01,100
That's not his nose.
That nose is all wrong.

79
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,751
That's nothing like his nose.
His nose is more bulbous than that.

80
00:04:03,787 --> 00:04:05,933
- Can you fill in any more 
details about the man?
- I told you,

81
00:04:05,966 --> 00:04:08,011
he is unkempt,
he is a frightened person,

82
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:10,743
he's wearing a yellow shirt,
he has a blue sleeve and glasses,

83
00:04:10,778 --> 00:04:13,013
and those glasses
are all wrong.

84
00:04:15,076 --> 00:04:19,863
- Hey, you want some pizza?
- No. Uh, lactose intolerant.

85
00:04:20,057 --> 00:04:21,893
Be better for all
of us if I didn't.

86
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:25,773
Only person we could find connected with
the Rios sisters is a grandmother...

87
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:28,973
Consuela Hernandez.
Trying to get ahold of her.

88
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:31,763
If Ricky's not with grandma...

89
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:35,332
You got that message out.
He is.

90
00:04:35,846 --> 00:04:39,751
What if he's standing outside
his school alone, waiting for me?

91
00:04:40,027 --> 00:04:42,543
Grandma's got him, okay?

92
00:04:45,495 --> 00:04:47,750
- Are they terrorists in there?
- What do they want?

93
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,803
From what we heard
on the 9-1-1 call,

94
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:52,072
it was supposed to be a
straightforward bank job

95
00:04:52,108 --> 00:04:53,602
till the robbers
got slowed down.

96
00:04:53,637 --> 00:04:55,193
You I.D. the robbers yet?

97
00:04:55,455 --> 00:04:58,463
One of 'em so far...
Randall Reese.

98
00:04:58,467 --> 00:05:01,513
He's got two strikes.
This would be his third.

99
00:05:01,747 --> 00:05:04,361
So if he doesn't want to go back to
jail for the rest of his life...

100
00:05:04,397 --> 00:05:06,743
This would be his
blaze of glory.

101
00:05:11,337 --> 00:05:12,911
6 weeks later.

102
00:05:13,196 --> 00:05:15,372
You got a speech on Mount
Sinai this morning or...

103
00:05:15,408 --> 00:05:18,723
No, no, no.
Just, uh, considering my gear.

104
00:05:18,876 --> 00:05:20,183
I've got my tent,

105
00:05:20,227 --> 00:05:23,633
my ditty bag,
which are of obvious relevance, although

106
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,553
my trekking poles and 
my walking staff, I don't know,

107
00:05:26,637 --> 00:05:29,670
- might be redundant.
- I've never been to big bear myself.

108
00:05:30,676 --> 00:05:31,962
Are you all right?

109
00:05:32,537 --> 00:05:35,071
Yeah, yeah. Uh...

110
00:05:36,186 --> 00:05:40,352
It's just that every time Mary and
I went away, which wasn't often,

111
00:05:40,356 --> 00:05:42,990
she always insisted
on packing for me.

112
00:05:43,156 --> 00:05:44,542
And I hated it.

113
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,181
'Cause who doesn't want
toose which pair of underwear

114
00:05:47,215 --> 00:05:48,993
he wants to wear when, right?

115
00:05:49,256 --> 00:05:51,612
You're gonna miss her
in some odd ways, man,

116
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,712
mostly the way she made you miserable.
It'll pass.

117
00:05:58,936 --> 00:06:00,462
I know.

118
00:06:01,505 --> 00:06:03,741
- Don't start any forest fires.
- All right.

119
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:06,990
- You watch your back out there.
- Yeah, yeah.

$200,000?
<i>Hour 5 - 7:36 PM</i>

125
00:06:42,248 --> 00:06:44,253
That's from medical school,
a student loan.

126
00:06:44,285 --> 00:06:46,241
He made a point of wanting to
pay for his own education.

127
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:48,992
Yet he accepted your gift of
a $3-million beach condo.

128
00:06:48,998 --> 00:06:52,542
When your 21, you can afford to be
righteous. When you're 30,
you're exhausted.

129
00:06:52,576 --> 00:06:54,732
I guess he wanted a
nice place to sleep.

130
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,751
- What can you tell me 
about his girlfriend?
- She's a caretaker.

131
00:06:57,785 --> 00:07:00,161
- A social worker.
- A little hard to get 
to know at first,

132
00:07:00,197 --> 00:07:03,190
but it's just strength.
She's had to be very strong.

133
00:07:03,398 --> 00:07:06,140
- Her own family had problems.
- Abuse? Mental illness?

134
00:07:06,237 --> 00:07:08,373
She has a severely
autistic brother.

135
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,761
Her parents gave all their
attention to the boy,

136
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:12,243
it tore their marriage apart,

137
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:14,250
and then they put
the boy in a home.

138
00:07:14,485 --> 00:07:17,031
Lizzie left Wisconsin to
get away from all that.

139
00:07:17,315 --> 00:07:20,453
- You seem to know her very well.
- Yes, we're very close.

140
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:22,831
My son is an only child.

141
00:07:24,106 --> 00:07:26,570
Lizzie's like a daughter to me.

142
00:07:29,906 --> 00:07:31,241
Oh, god.

143
00:07:31,955 --> 00:07:32,980
Lizzie.

144
00:07:33,274 --> 00:07:38,043
Oh, hi, Sheryl.
It's so good to see you.

145
00:07:38,274 --> 00:07:40,306
Hi. It's been so long.

146
00:07:42,604 --> 00:07:44,877
I never get to see him anymore.

147
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:48,332
And, you know, a mother can only
give so much space before she...

148
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:51,771
Before she shows up and hijacks
you for a mediocre cafeteria lunch.

149
00:07:51,787 --> 00:07:53,493
I'll take whatever I can get.

150
00:07:53,655 --> 00:07:56,461
Uh, so anything new with you?

151
00:07:56,678 --> 00:07:58,492
You look so thin.

152
00:07:58,965 --> 00:08:01,531
Well, she's been...
she's been working a lot, ma.

153
00:08:01,597 --> 00:08:03,853
Hey, why don't you go ahead,
and I'll meet you down there?

154
00:08:03,885 --> 00:08:05,713
Okay? I have to talk to
Lizzie about a patient.

155
00:08:05,748 --> 00:08:08,502
- Yeah, we should do that.
- Okay.

156
00:09:10,755 --> 00:09:13,033
Why haven't you told your
parents I'm pregnant?

157
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:16,023
Look... You kept this a secret.

158
00:09:16,258 --> 00:09:18,821
You're still not even sure
how much you want from me.

159
00:09:18,856 --> 00:09:22,493
So was I to assume that you'd want
doting grandparents out of them?

160
00:09:22,785 --> 00:09:24,223
You know them, Lizzie.

161
00:09:24,268 --> 00:09:26,223
My mother will show
up on your doorstep

162
00:09:26,297 --> 00:09:28,291
with pink-and-blue
wallpaper and a crib,

163
00:09:28,298 --> 00:09:31,790
and my father will start picking out
biblical names. Do you want that?

164
00:09:34,926 --> 00:09:37,412
Why haven't you
seen your family?

165
00:09:38,896 --> 00:09:40,740
You were so close.

166
00:09:42,596 --> 00:09:46,332
Why are you hiding
things from them?

167
00:09:49,648 --> 00:09:51,820
If I tell them that
you're pregnant,

168
00:09:52,656 --> 00:09:55,072
and I tell them that it's mine,

169
00:09:55,445 --> 00:09:57,893
they're gonna want to know
what happened in there

170
00:09:58,835 --> 00:10:01,013
to make us not...

171
00:10:15,145 --> 00:10:17,313
It's her... again.

172
00:10:17,728 --> 00:10:21,403
Tell my mother no wedding
talk at work. Ugh!

173
00:10:23,215 --> 00:10:24,353
Yeah?

174
00:10:25,937 --> 00:10:27,903
You did not bring those for me.

175
00:10:29,968 --> 00:10:31,143
No. I pilfered them from
candice in misdemeanors.

176
00:10:31,175 --> 00:10:32,793
She was on her way up here.

177
00:10:33,147 --> 00:10:35,971
I thought I'd save you from
the high-pitched girlie fever.

178
00:10:36,005 --> 00:10:38,263
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, Hillary.

179
00:10:38,495 --> 00:10:40,501
Or Mrs.
Clinton if you'd prefer.

180
00:10:40,788 --> 00:10:43,430
- I heard that one a couple of times today.
- You've gotta be kidding me.

181
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:46,283
Well, your boss/fiancé is
gonna be the next D.A.

182
00:10:46,597 --> 00:10:49,242
Yeah, well, I think I've
earned my own identity here.

183
00:10:49,437 --> 00:10:52,341
And Ed and I prepared for
any potential complications.

184
00:10:52,698 --> 00:10:56,083
- Am I early?
- No. Come on in.

185
00:10:58,936 --> 00:11:01,611
- Of all the gin joints...
- Yeah, I know.

186
00:11:01,887 --> 00:11:05,781
I can't believe we never caught a case
together after all these years. Thanks.

187
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:08,043
Wow.

188
00:11:10,315 --> 00:11:14,320
- You said yes.
- I asked if I could try it 
on for a couple of days,

189
00:11:14,535 --> 00:11:16,743
see, uh, see how eternity felt.

190
00:11:19,927 --> 00:11:22,041
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

191
00:11:22,385 --> 00:11:24,731
- Everybody know?
 - I don't know. I didn't phone 
 tree everybody.

192
00:11:24,766 --> 00:11:26,953
I've just been trying
to keep it mellow.

193
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:28,620
Good luck with that.

194
00:11:28,878 --> 00:11:31,103
- So should we get cracking?
- Yeah.

195
00:11:32,027 --> 00:11:35,640
I see your husband was 
a football player at U.S.C.
<i>Hour 6 - 8:04 PM</i>

196
00:11:35,918 --> 00:11:37,932
He was suspended from
the team for fighting.

197
00:11:37,968 --> 00:11:39,970
That fight was with
his no-good brother,

198
00:11:40,275 --> 00:11:42,541
who came up to a game all
the way from Pittsburgh

199
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:44,900
to say who did
Malcolm think he was,

200
00:11:45,196 --> 00:11:47,293
turning his nose up to
where he came from.

201
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:49,201
So there are problems
with his family?

202
00:11:49,237 --> 00:11:50,790
No, no, there were no problems

203
00:11:51,075 --> 00:11:53,262
as long as he gave them
money when they asked for it.

204
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:58,112
- Why does he do that?
- Because he takes care of his own, 
no matter what.

205
00:11:58,275 --> 00:12:00,600
Your daughter's lucky
he's in there with her.

206
00:12:01,006 --> 00:12:03,280
And he cares about those
other people, too...

207
00:12:03,568 --> 00:12:06,930
Eva, Franny...
I mean, they're just like family.

208
00:12:10,865 --> 00:12:12,011
Hey.

209
00:12:14,126 --> 00:12:17,981
- Why didn't you tell me Eva 
had a safety deposit box?
- Oh, Franny.

210
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:20,271
- This is her stuff, Malcolm.
- I know.

211
00:12:20,505 --> 00:12:22,121
Well, I would've
led to have known.

212
00:12:22,155 --> 00:12:24,980
You're right. I'm sorry.

213
00:12:25,156 --> 00:12:26,540
It's okay.

214
00:12:28,046 --> 00:12:30,363
I'm sorry.

215
00:12:30,955 --> 00:12:32,340
I'm just...

216
00:12:34,097 --> 00:12:37,073
It's just now I have to open
that damn box, you know?

217
00:12:37,097 --> 00:12:39,281
Well, if you're not ready to go inside,
I can do it for you.

218
00:12:39,315 --> 00:12:42,061
I'll bag up the contents
and bring it out to you.

219
00:12:42,675 --> 00:12:44,663
- Kathryn.
- Hmm?

220
00:12:45,095 --> 00:12:47,913
Sorry, sorry. I just, um...

221
00:12:48,906 --> 00:12:52,513
One of my colleagues was razzing me
earlier about something, so I'm a...

222
00:12:52,677 --> 00:12:54,343
What was he saying?

223
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:58,773
That once I marry Ed, I'm just gonna
become the girl behind the guy.

224
00:12:59,015 --> 00:13:01,742
Never happen.
You're too good at your job.

225
00:13:01,755 --> 00:13:03,603
How do you know how good I am?

226
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:05,851
When I work with somebody,
I check up on 'em.

227
00:13:05,987 --> 00:13:09,530
Yeah, well, your record's pretty damn
spotty, but I'll take my chances.

228
00:13:16,035 --> 00:13:18,271
What, you see a ghost?

229
00:13:18,517 --> 00:13:22,123
Kinda. My ex-wife.

230
00:13:27,176 --> 00:13:30,521
So you worked with Cavanaugh 
for almost six years?
<i>Hour 6 - 8:18 PM</i>

231
00:13:30,626 --> 00:13:32,332
So what kind of cop is he?

232
00:13:32,605 --> 00:13:35,562
Smart, brave, good judgment.

233
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:37,823
Come on, detective.
I just looked at his file.

234
00:13:37,856 --> 00:13:41,102
- Smart and brave, maybe.
- He made mistakes, had some personal problems...

235
00:13:41,138 --> 00:13:43,242
Not so unusual in
this line of work.

236
00:13:43,488 --> 00:13:47,142
- So he got a divorce last year.
- Again, not so unusual in this line of work.

237
00:13:47,176 --> 00:13:49,672
His ex worked on the force
in the same department.

238
00:13:49,808 --> 00:13:52,313
- That's where they met, yeah.
- What was their relationship like?

239
00:13:52,346 --> 00:13:54,780
He said potato,
she said moo shu pork.

240
00:13:55,048 --> 00:13:59,193
Her risk-junkie crap played into his
weaknesses, she sucked him into trouble.

241
00:13:59,385 --> 00:14:00,902
You look good, Nick.

242
00:14:01,168 --> 00:14:02,730
You tracked me down, Juliana?

243
00:14:03,057 --> 00:14:06,101
I went down to the station.
The boys said that you were here.

244
00:14:06,588 --> 00:14:09,212
What's it been, six months?

245
00:14:11,987 --> 00:14:14,831
- Well, it's been nice catching up.
- Nick...

246
00:14:15,398 --> 00:14:17,790
- I need something from you.
- I don't doubt it.

247
00:14:18,026 --> 00:14:20,170
- I think I've been made.
- What?

248
00:14:20,188 --> 00:14:22,532
I've been deep in this
narcotics case forver a month,

249
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:24,202
and I'm...
I'm getting a bad feeling.

250
00:14:24,306 --> 00:14:26,343
- You're getting a bad feeling?
- I've got a bad feeling, okay?

251
00:14:26,378 --> 00:14:28,262
Would I drive here all
the way from San Diego

252
00:14:28,297 --> 00:14:30,340
with my tail between
my legs for nothing?

253
00:14:30,465 --> 00:14:32,501
- Talk to me.
- You still have that contact,

254
00:14:32,536 --> 00:14:34,881
that C.I.
connected to the Los Inmortales gang?

255
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:37,522
Miguel. Yeah.
But he's on the fringes, Juliana.

256
00:14:37,748 --> 00:14:39,992
- I haven't worked with him for over a year.
- Yeah, but can he confirm or deny

257
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:42,083
whether or not these
guys know I'm a cop?

258
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:43,620
Nick, I can't go home.

259
00:14:43,805 --> 00:14:45,270
I can't go to work.

260
00:14:45,455 --> 00:14:48,602
I-I can't get a cup of coffee
without looking over my shoulder.

261
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,362
All right, I'll call Miguel.

262
00:14:51,638 --> 00:14:53,591
Now why don't you go
back to the station

263
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:55,572
and hang out with the
boys for a little while?

264
00:14:55,607 --> 00:14:58,220
Or maybe you could just give
me the keys to our place.

265
00:14:58,258 --> 00:15:01,371
- Your place.
- Go back to the station.

266
00:15:04,415 --> 00:15:06,731
- She's hot.
- Juliana...

267
00:15:06,798 --> 00:15:09,223
- You have a thing there?
- She's engaged.

268
00:15:09,547 --> 00:15:11,611
- Didn't stop us.
- Go.

269
00:15:16,098 --> 00:15:19,042
Is he a man of faith like you,
Rabbi Kates?

270
00:15:19,267 --> 00:15:21,030
<i>Hour 5 - 7:42 PM</i>
Well, he's a doctor.

271
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:22,783
If people are hurt,
he'll be a man of action.

272
00:15:22,817 --> 00:15:25,233
- Of course, if people are hurt...
- Will he be protective of his girlfriend?

273
00:15:25,268 --> 00:15:27,411
- Absolutely, yes.
- Oh, yes. He loves her. Yes.

274
00:15:27,446 --> 00:15:29,511
So what's going on with you?

275
00:15:30,965 --> 00:15:33,880
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

276
00:15:34,607 --> 00:15:37,702
Well, what happened between
you and Lizzie for one?

277
00:15:37,948 --> 00:15:40,610
You were looking for engagement
rings before the whole thing,

278
00:15:40,646 --> 00:15:42,473
and now there's
nothing between you?

279
00:15:42,848 --> 00:15:44,721
I don't want to
talk about that.

280
00:15:44,956 --> 00:15:47,202
- Why?
- Ma, please.

281
00:15:50,745 --> 00:15:52,481
Have you been to a therapist?

282
00:15:52,778 --> 00:15:55,220
Because I broke up
with my girlfriend?

283
00:15:55,527 --> 00:16:01,620
Because you experienced things 
I lie awake imagining because 
you won't tell me.

284
00:16:01,867 --> 00:16:04,682
I'm fine, mom. I am.

285
00:16:05,127 --> 00:16:07,640
You saw me the very next day.

286
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:10,002
There wasn't a scratch on me.

287
00:16:10,598 --> 00:16:13,713
What kind of mother would
I be if I believed you?

288
00:16:15,295 --> 00:16:17,363
The merciful kind?

289
00:16:21,536 --> 00:16:23,551
Baby, look at me.

290
00:16:24,747 --> 00:16:27,632
Look at me.

291
00:16:31,345 --> 00:16:33,832
Why don't you come to
shabbat dinner tonight?

292
00:16:34,168 --> 00:16:37,511
- You always loved it, 
and we really miss you.
- I gotta work, mom.

293
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:41,643
Please just come and be
with us sit at our table.

294
00:16:41,908 --> 00:16:45,231
We'll light the candles,
say the blessings and eat together.

295
00:16:45,457 --> 00:16:48,123
I swear,
we won't ask any questions.

296
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:06,542
How you doing?

297
00:17:07,478 --> 00:17:09,782
I'm great. Let's go.

298
00:17:26,148 --> 00:17:28,071
It's, uh, this one right here.

299
00:17:28,885 --> 00:17:33,303
- Okay, ready?
- Yeah.

300
00:17:59,126 --> 00:18:02,592
Thanks, grandma.
I thought I was getting these.

301
00:18:14,936 --> 00:18:18,202
- What is it?
- Letters to Eva,

302
00:18:18,707 --> 00:18:21,320
and this one's dated
four months ago.

303
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:26,032
- Who are they from?
- My mother.

304
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:32,400
I haven't seen her in 20 years.

305
00:18:34,425 --> 00:18:37,621
Do you mean that Franny or
Eva have any *** problems?

306
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,570
No. Franny goes out every night.
<i>Hour 6 - 8:23 PM</i>

307
00:18:40,865 --> 00:18:44,033
She should have a health problem,
but she's strong like a horse.

308
00:18:44,068 --> 00:18:46,312
Any history of mental
health issues?

309
00:18:46,628 --> 00:18:49,033
Her good-for-nothing mother.

310
00:18:49,316 --> 00:18:51,220
My own daughter
I'm talking about.

311
00:18:51,235 --> 00:18:54,141
Ana left when Franny was 4,
Eva was 8.

312
00:18:54,515 --> 00:18:57,960
- So she won't be any help to us?
- If you find her, you let me know.

313
00:18:58,055 --> 00:19:01,810
I see in 1996,you pressed charges
against Franny for stealing.

314
00:19:02,105 --> 00:19:06,013
Franny received a call from
her crazy cousin Angela,

315
00:19:06,218 --> 00:19:07,862
lives in Salt Lake City.

316
00:19:07,886 --> 00:19:10,122
Swears she sees
Franny's mother.

317
00:19:10,528 --> 00:19:13,100
Franny wants me to
buy her a plane ticket

318
00:19:13,405 --> 00:19:15,580
to chase a ghost. I said no.

319
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:18,043
Franny's stubborn.
She stole my credit card.

320
00:19:18,315 --> 00:19:21,191
- So you called the cops on her.
- Franny goes all this way,

321
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:23,440
she finds this woman.

322
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:26,781
It's not her mommy.

323
00:19:26,996 --> 00:19:29,043
Of course it's not Ana.

324
00:19:29,267 --> 00:19:31,501
That's why I dropped
the charges, okay?

325
00:19:41,876 --> 00:19:44,340
My whole childhood,
my grandma always told me

326
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:47,812
"We are better off with her gone.
We're better off with her gone."

327
00:19:47,968 --> 00:19:51,313
Then the years went by, and I made
myself think that she was dead.

328
00:19:51,918 --> 00:19:53,372
And now...

329
00:19:53,605 --> 00:19:56,453
Now I find out that she has
lived 20 minutes away from me

330
00:19:56,748 --> 00:19:59,363
for five months,
and Evie didn't tell me.

331
00:19:59,617 --> 00:20:01,871
I mean,
how can she not tell me?

332
00:20:02,215 --> 00:20:05,541
How can she have these
letters and move in with me

333
00:20:05,815 --> 00:20:08,493
and look me in the
eye over breakfast

334
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,951
and lunch and...
and at work and the whole time in there?

335
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:17,021
- Well, I'm sure she had her reasons.
- Yeah, well, her reasons 
aren't good enough.

336
00:20:17,057 --> 00:20:19,693
I mean, look...
my mother writes...

337
00:20:21,506 --> 00:20:25,843
"my mother writes," I'm
actually saying that.

338
00:20:26,178 --> 00:20:29,643
"Evie, please come and
see me so we can talk."

339
00:20:29,825 --> 00:20:32,612
And I'm the big jerk, you know?

340
00:20:33,057 --> 00:20:35,822
I don't even know if she went.

341
00:20:37,556 --> 00:20:40,182
I don't know what
they talked about...

342
00:20:41,726 --> 00:20:44,572
Or if she asked about me.

343
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:55,491
Why does Miguel want
to meet you in person?

344
00:20:55,696 --> 00:20:57,403
Look, I don't love it either,

345
00:20:57,655 --> 00:21:01,143
but he doesn't want to talk on the
phone, and you need an answer, right?

346
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:04,000
What'd you do to get yourself
into this mess, Juliana?

347
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,431
I'm an undercover cop,
Nick, not a soccer mom.

348
00:21:06,467 --> 00:21:08,323
It's a dangerous business.

349
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:10,210
Why is everything
always my fault?

350
00:21:10,357 --> 00:21:12,181
Well, did you compromise
yourself in any way? Did you

351
00:21:12,217 --> 00:21:13,852
get too close to your mark?

352
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:16,863
- Were you drinking when 
you buddied up with these guys?
- I'm not your father, Nick.

353
00:21:16,897 --> 00:21:20,450
- Must we have this conversation 
11,000 times?
- Fair enough.

354
00:21:21,936 --> 00:21:24,313
So how's my car?

355
00:21:25,428 --> 00:21:28,372
I traded it in for a hybrid.

356
00:21:29,257 --> 00:21:32,200
- How's my dog?
- Misses you.

357
00:21:32,415 --> 00:21:35,753
- Pisses in my shoes sometimes.
- That's my boy.

358
00:21:37,026 --> 00:21:38,092
The best deal and...

359
00:21:38,247 --> 00:21:42,362
Firefighters responded to a
multiple alarm blaze last night

360
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:46,223
at a commercial warehouse located at
York and Figueroa in Highland Park...

361
00:21:46,455 --> 00:21:48,323
- Hey.
- How are you?

362
00:21:48,457 --> 00:21:49,711
Good.

363
00:21:50,186 --> 00:21:51,810
So...

364
00:21:52,146 --> 00:21:55,343
I'm going to my parents'
house tonight for dinner.

365
00:21:55,525 --> 00:21:57,321
- You are?
- Yes.

366
00:21:57,588 --> 00:22:00,583
And... I'm going to tell
them about the baby.

367
00:22:01,706 --> 00:22:04,793
- You're gonna tell them about the baby.
- Mm-hmm.

368
00:22:04,817 --> 00:22:07,271
- And nothing more?
- That's right.

369
00:22:07,476 --> 00:22:10,401
But... y-you said yourself,
they're not gonna settle...

370
00:22:10,677 --> 00:22:12,570
I-I know what I said.

371
00:22:12,808 --> 00:22:16,483
I'm hurting them by not seeing them.
They don't deserve that.

372
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:19,272
And they swore they
wouldn't push, so...

373
00:22:21,268 --> 00:22:24,872
What do you want me to tell
them about reaching out to you?

374
00:22:26,187 --> 00:22:29,152
I want you to have
them if you want them.

375
00:22:29,298 --> 00:22:31,022
You should have the support.

376
00:22:33,737 --> 00:22:35,940
I really miss them.

377
00:22:36,595 --> 00:22:39,440
I know that sounds
selfish and weird.

378
00:22:40,346 --> 00:22:43,003
Well, they were a
part of your life.

379
00:22:47,127 --> 00:22:49,700
You can come with
me if you want.

380
00:22:52,977 --> 00:22:54,592
Think about it.

381
00:22:58,405 --> 00:23:02,891
Love is all I want.

382
00:23:04,476 --> 00:23:06,513
Love is all...

383
00:23:12,878 --> 00:23:14,843
I came down, you know?

384
00:23:15,077 --> 00:23:17,620
To the bank,
during the standoff...

385
00:23:18,287 --> 00:23:20,760
They used me to profile you.

386
00:23:21,048 --> 00:23:23,501
I was wondering why
it went to hell.

387
00:23:26,116 --> 00:23:29,162
I called you after to
see how you were doing.

388
00:23:29,838 --> 00:23:32,540
I got your message. Thanks.

389
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:42,073
So you took in that
happy-sad hero guy Egan, huh?

390
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,431
I staked out your
house a little.

391
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:47,572
That's terrific.

392
00:23:47,796 --> 00:23:49,721
I was paranoid, okay?

393
00:23:49,957 --> 00:23:51,593
I was scared to see you and...

394
00:23:51,878 --> 00:23:56,183
Like, would you be this totally
different person after what you
went through?

395
00:23:58,038 --> 00:23:59,503
That's him.

396
00:24:00,115 --> 00:24:01,321
That's Miguel?

397
00:24:01,546 --> 00:24:03,421
Yeah, that's him.
Stay in the car.

398
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:05,632
I'm not an idiot.

399
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,963
Juliana, get down! Get down!

400
00:24:25,218 --> 00:24:26,223
Stop!

401
00:24:27,848 --> 00:24:29,220
Stop!

402
00:24:40,257 --> 00:24:44,172
So you want me to attest to him as
a cop or an ex-husband or what?

403
00:24:44,555 --> 00:24:47,833
- So who ended the relationship?
- I did. Then he did.

404
00:24:48,057 --> 00:24:49,561
<i>Hour 7 - 9:13 PM</i>
Then I did.

405
00:24:49,765 --> 00:24:52,052
- But he officially filed for the divorce.
- He was better at paperwork than I was.

406
00:24:52,085 --> 00:24:54,131
Is he gonna play nice
with us in there?

407
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:56,713
Depends...

408
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:58,591
How he thinks you're
doing out here.

409
00:24:58,795 --> 00:25:00,723
So he likes control?

410
00:25:01,037 --> 00:25:03,250
He'll do what he has to do.

411
00:25:04,148 --> 00:25:06,010
No matter how dangerous?

412
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:08,193
The more dangerous, the better.

413
00:25:13,668 --> 00:25:17,361
Wow, looks exactly the same...

414
00:25:17,505 --> 00:25:19,311
minus all my crap.

415
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:21,323
Make yourself at home.

416
00:25:21,928 --> 00:25:24,732
You sure you're all right,
me being here?

417
00:25:25,835 --> 00:25:27,761
You want something to drink?

418
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,980
I'd love a beer.

419
00:25:48,598 --> 00:25:49,561
Thank you.

420
00:26:31,087 --> 00:26:35,201

Amein.

426
00:26:51,006 --> 00:26:52,161
Jeremy,

427
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,923
would you like to say the
blessing over the bread?

428
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:56,391
Uh, sure.

429
00:26:56,605 --> 00:26:58,320
Barukh atah adonai,

430
00:26:58,588 --> 00:27:01,912
eloheinu, melekh ha'olam
ha-motzi lechem min ha-aretz.

431
00:27:02,226 --> 00:27:04,593
- Amein.
- Amein.

432
00:27:07,878 --> 00:27:10,283
How do I even know
that she's home?

433
00:27:11,326 --> 00:27:14,072
All right, I can't take it anymore.
I have to face her.

434
00:27:14,096 --> 00:27:16,231
- I mean, we have come all this way.
- Franny,

435
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:17,953
we've come 20 minutes.

436
00:27:18,156 --> 00:27:19,932
If you're not ready...

437
00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:24,321
Wait, you're supposed to tell me
I have nothing to be afraid of.

438
00:27:24,617 --> 00:27:26,833
You have a lot to be afraid of.

439
00:27:27,867 --> 00:27:29,843
But who gives a damn?

440
00:27:31,005 --> 00:27:32,310
Thanks.

441
00:27:33,687 --> 00:27:35,620
Everything looks so good.

442
00:27:35,907 --> 00:27:40,082
I want to welcome Jeremy back to
our table, to welcome Lizzie.

443
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:43,302
These chairs have
been empty for...

444
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:50,140
We have news.

445
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:51,842
You're back together.

446
00:27:52,158 --> 00:27:54,301
No, no. We're not.

447
00:27:57,845 --> 00:27:59,923
Lizzie is pregnant.

448
00:28:01,318 --> 00:28:03,392
Mom, dad,

449
00:28:04,035 --> 00:28:06,202
you're going to
be grandparents.

450
00:28:11,326 --> 00:28:12,433
Well...

451
00:28:12,868 --> 00:28:16,780
Well, I-I'm at once
overjoyed and heartbroken.

452
00:28:16,956 --> 00:28:20,683
I-I know I promised not
to ask any questions, but

453
00:28:21,035 --> 00:28:22,813
I don't understand.

454
00:28:28,816 --> 00:28:30,313
It's me.

455
00:28:32,755 --> 00:28:37,991
Things happened to me during
those two days inside the bank.

456
00:28:38,256 --> 00:28:42,552
- I came out all 
turned around and confused...
- Stop.

457
00:28:56,847 --> 00:29:01,060
Lizzie and I can't be together,
despite the

458
00:29:01,255 --> 00:29:06,340
child we are about to have,
because of me.

459
00:29:09,455 --> 00:29:12,090
We had been trapped inside the...
the bank

460
00:29:12,366 --> 00:29:14,861
for hours and hours, and...

461
00:29:16,237 --> 00:29:19,342
the security guard
had just been killed.

462
00:29:20,056 --> 00:29:23,221
I've seen people die on my table,
but this... this was...

463
00:29:23,426 --> 00:29:25,353
You were scared for your life.

464
00:29:31,818 --> 00:29:33,951
One of the gunmen...

465
00:29:34,845 --> 00:29:38,682
grabbed me and Lizzie,
and he took us away from the others.

466
00:29:38,937 --> 00:29:41,612
He took us... into the back,

467
00:29:41,877 --> 00:29:44,343
into a-a hallway...

468
00:29:45,456 --> 00:29:47,681
and there was a door
at the end of it,

469
00:29:47,858 --> 00:29:50,100
an... an exit door.

470
00:29:50,695 --> 00:29:55,220
And the gunman got distracted
for a few seconds.

471
00:29:58,265 --> 00:30:00,151
And I ran.

472
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:06,091
I ran to the door...

473
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:10,181
away from Lizzie...

474
00:30:10,728 --> 00:30:12,312
to save myself.

475
00:30:15,385 --> 00:30:18,372
Now I never made it out,
of course. The...

476
00:30:18,876 --> 00:30:23,443
the gunman stopped me
there before I could.

477
00:30:23,627 --> 00:30:25,121
And then I thought...

478
00:30:26,986 --> 00:30:29,130
He's gonna shoot me.

479
00:30:31,136 --> 00:30:32,442
But...

480
00:30:33,437 --> 00:30:35,012
in that moment...

481
00:30:37,718 --> 00:30:41,433
I was more afraid of turning
around and facing you.

482
00:30:44,068 --> 00:30:46,151
And when I did...

483
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,853
The look on your face...

484
00:30:53,077 --> 00:30:54,890
I'll never forget it.

485
00:30:57,138 --> 00:30:58,553
Betrayed...

486
00:31:00,606 --> 00:31:02,191
Abandoned...

487
00:31:03,857 --> 00:31:05,421
I did that to you.

488
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:41,861
Hi.

489
00:31:42,435 --> 00:31:43,770
Um...

490
00:31:44,728 --> 00:31:46,003
Hi.

491
00:31:47,327 --> 00:31:49,140
Are you Ana's daughter?

492
00:31:51,897 --> 00:31:53,223
Yes.

493
00:31:54,485 --> 00:31:55,731
Okay.

494
00:32:01,876 --> 00:32:03,370
Oh, my god.

495
00:32:04,767 --> 00:32:06,521
Go inside.

496
00:32:09,606 --> 00:32:11,091
Franny?

497
00:32:12,475 --> 00:32:13,841
Hi.

498
00:32:16,595 --> 00:32:18,281
So what broke you two apart?

499
00:32:18,567 --> 00:32:20,712
I was always right and
he was always wrong.

500
00:32:20,787 --> 00:32:23,173
It got in our way a little.
<i>Hour 7 - 9:22 PM</i>

501
00:32:23,377 --> 00:32:25,720
I see there was a domestic
violence call in 2003.

502
00:32:25,758 --> 00:32:28,230
- Does he have a temper?
- Look, we fought a lot.

503
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:29,971
I'd scream bloody murder,

504
00:32:30,206 --> 00:32:31,913
the neighbor would
call the cops,

505
00:32:32,206 --> 00:32:34,440
but Nick wouldn't lay
a hand on a woman.

506
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:37,121
In fact,
I think I hit him that night.

507
00:32:38,518 --> 00:32:40,563
Because it wasn't a
mistake in San Diego.

508
00:32:40,998 --> 00:32:43,020
Because... because I need him.

509
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:46,121
Because I trust him.

510
00:32:47,528 --> 00:32:48,950
No, no.

511
00:32:49,248 --> 00:32:50,670
No, I don't think so.

512
00:32:50,985 --> 00:32:53,272
Captai I've
definitely been made.

513
00:32:53,475 --> 00:32:54,701
I don't know.

514
00:32:54,898 --> 00:32:56,393
I don't know.

515
00:32:57,038 --> 00:32:59,241
Dominick's guys could
show up anywhere,

516
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,470
hit me when I'm least expecting it.
I don't know what to do.

517
00:33:02,986 --> 00:33:06,240
Maybe. Maybe I could lay
low here for a while.

518
00:33:07,758 --> 00:33:10,511
Well, I don't know if I'm safe.
How do I know?

519
00:33:11,636 --> 00:33:13,422
Get off the phone.

520
00:33:13,817 --> 00:33:16,101
Uh, let...
let me call you back.

521
00:33:16,808 --> 00:33:18,860
First of all, you're all right.

522
00:33:19,118 --> 00:33:20,890
- I know.
- You're all right.

523
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:23,231
- You're alive, okay?
- Okay.

524
00:33:23,517 --> 00:33:25,000
I got three squad cars
stationed outside.

525
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:27,133
Nobody's gonna get to you here.

526
00:33:27,145 --> 00:33:28,771
I can't even believe
I got you into this.

527
00:33:28,805 --> 00:33:30,333
Of course I did.
I came to you looking for help.

528
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:33,760
- I don't even know what I was thinking.
- Hey, we'll figure it out.

529
00:33:34,315 --> 00:33:36,293
What are we gonna do, Nick?

530
00:33:38,748 --> 00:33:40,421
We'll figure it out.

531
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:44,121
Are... are you sure you
don't want to come inside?

532
00:33:45,555 --> 00:33:48,443
We can sit in the living room.

533
00:33:48,715 --> 00:33:51,310
- I can make you some tea.
- Did Eva come here?

534
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:54,660
- Yes. Once.
- When?

535
00:33:54,938 --> 00:33:56,853
Four months ago.

536
00:34:00,827 --> 00:34:04,431
- What happened?
- I blew it.

537
00:34:04,746 --> 00:34:06,600
She came to check me out.

538
00:34:06,898 --> 00:34:11,502
- I wrote her and said I'd moved to town...
- So you didn't want to write me?

539
00:34:13,128 --> 00:34:14,713
I was a coward.

540
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:18,471
I didn't think you
would remember me.

541
00:34:18,665 --> 00:34:20,262
Well, I don't.

542
00:34:20,836 --> 00:34:22,663
I don't remember you.

543
00:34:30,058 --> 00:34:33,513
- What's your little girl's name?
- Tiffany.

544
00:34:35,197 --> 00:34:37,780
Did Eva meet her?

545
00:34:38,505 --> 00:34:41,010
Tiffany was at school that day.

546
00:34:41,255 --> 00:34:46,012
- So Eva didn't meet her?
- Eva loved you a lot.

547
00:34:46,655 --> 00:34:50,801
She didn't want me coming anywhere
near you till she saw me for herself.

548
00:34:50,847 --> 00:34:53,150
- And you listened to her?
- I was afraid of her, honey.

549
00:34:53,188 --> 00:34:55,412
I'm afraid of you right now.

550
00:34:56,155 --> 00:34:58,161
What can I do to you?

551
00:34:59,537 --> 00:35:02,560
- What can I take from you?
- Oh, Franny.

552
00:35:02,876 --> 00:35:06,302
No, what can I
possibly take from you

553
00:35:06,517 --> 00:35:08,913
that can compare with what
you've taken from me?

554
00:35:08,956 --> 00:35:12,253
- I've always loved you.
- Oh, god, don't say that.

555
00:35:12,585 --> 00:35:14,260
I always did.

556
00:35:15,855 --> 00:35:20,401
I wanted everything to go so well
when Eva final came over here.

557
00:35:21,567 --> 00:35:24,173
She was really angry with me,

558
00:35:24,407 --> 00:35:26,281
like she should have been.

559
00:35:26,865 --> 00:35:28,563
And instead of

560
00:35:28,946 --> 00:35:31,223
taking all the stuff
she needed to say

561
00:35:31,506 --> 00:35:33,870
like I should've,
like a mother would,

562
00:35:34,135 --> 00:35:38,352
I defended myself,
and we fought, and she left.

563
00:35:39,197 --> 00:35:42,500
But I told myself that
I would see her again...

564
00:35:44,366 --> 00:35:46,183
that someday,

565
00:35:46,468 --> 00:35:49,131
she would bring you to me.

566
00:35:56,608 --> 00:35:59,831
So... that happened.

567
00:36:04,055 --> 00:36:06,431
You didn't have to jump
in there like that

568
00:36:06,635 --> 00:36:08,900
- and lie for me.
- I wasn't lying,

569
00:36:09,415 --> 00:36:11,260
not really.

570
00:36:11,856 --> 00:36:14,993
It's just,
we never talked about what happened.

571
00:36:15,197 --> 00:36:16,440
I know.

572
00:36:17,806 --> 00:36:18,991
And...

573
00:36:19,028 --> 00:36:21,462
when I heard you
say it out loud

574
00:36:21,785 --> 00:36:24,170
and when I watched
you say it out loud,

575
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:28,382
- I felt so guilty.
- Why?

576
00:36:29,007 --> 00:36:33,413
You hurt me, Jeremy.
You really did.

577
00:36:33,978 --> 00:36:35,853
And I have been

578
00:36:36,138 --> 00:36:40,573
so wrapped up in my own pain
since we got out of there...

579
00:36:41,248 --> 00:36:45,992
That I forgot you've
been really hurt, too.

580
00:36:53,325 --> 00:36:55,161
Thank you for coming.

581
00:36:55,626 --> 00:36:57,592
Thank you for having me.

582
00:37:04,127 --> 00:37:05,810
Thank you. Thank you.

583
00:37:06,106 --> 00:37:08,202
- Thank you for your support.
- Of course.

584
00:37:09,768 --> 00:37:12,082
- Hey.
- Hey.

585
00:37:12,368 --> 00:37:15,971
- Want to get a cup of coffee?
- Yes. Thank you.

586
00:37:17,617 --> 00:37:22,540
So... am I arm candy?

587
00:37:22,747 --> 00:37:24,351
What?

588
00:37:24,615 --> 00:37:26,242
Well, I just...

589
00:37:26,566 --> 00:37:29,993
I see that Alex isn't here or Marley.
So I'm wondering

590
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:32,653
if I'm on the list because 
I'm A.D.A. Kathryn Hale

591
00:37:32,686 --> 00:37:34,942
or because I'm Ed
Nielson's future wife.

592
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:36,911
Hey...

593
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:40,191
You are here because
you earned it.

594
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:43,990
I'm here because you needed
a date to this awful thing.

595
00:37:44,326 --> 00:37:45,570
Thanks.

596
00:37:46,376 --> 00:37:48,243
Hey, Nick.

597
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:52,062
- Uh, what are you doing here?
- Crashing. Hi.

598
00:37:52,287 --> 00:37:54,061
- Ed, how are you?
- Nick.

599
00:37:54,325 --> 00:37:57,691
- Can I talk to him for a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

600
00:37:57,698 --> 00:38:00,252
- I'll bring him right back.
- Okay.

601
00:38:04,207 --> 00:38:06,020
I can't wait to hear this.

602
00:38:06,847 --> 00:38:08,702
I need your help
with sething, Ed.

603
00:38:08,888 --> 00:38:10,213
Okay.

604
00:38:10,506 --> 00:38:12,712
The life of a fellow
cop is in danger.

605
00:38:13,426 --> 00:38:15,150
Well, who's the cop?

606
00:38:16,177 --> 00:38:18,781
- My ex-wife.
- Ms. Hale.

607
00:38:18,995 --> 00:38:21,600
Mm. Excuse me.
Mr. Mayor, hello.

608
00:38:21,857 --> 00:38:24,102
You surprised to see me actually
attending my own function?

609
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:25,850
Uh, no, no, just...

610
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:29,762
to be candid, I'm just...
I'm surprised you know my name.

611
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:33,252
- Well, don't be. I've had my eye on you.
- Really?

612
00:38:33,535 --> 00:38:36,792
I keep close tabs on all the best
prosecutors in the department.

613
00:38:36,976 --> 00:38:38,881
And after the bank crisis...

614
00:38:39,206 --> 00:38:41,962
Well, let's just say you've
become quite an inspiration

615
00:38:42,175 --> 00:38:45,752
- to a lot of people.
- So what do you think I can do?

616
00:38:45,996 --> 00:38:48,790
You can use every channel you've
got to get the word out fast

617
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:51,660
to every associate of this gang
that two of their lieutenants...

618
00:38:51,698 --> 00:38:53,640
the guys that shot
at her last night...

619
00:38:53,887 --> 00:38:56,120
have been arrested,
they're in custody and they're talking.

620
00:38:56,158 --> 00:38:58,492
Whoever's got their finger on the
trigger better back the hell off.

621
00:38:58,527 --> 00:39:01,621
And that I'm prepared to wage a
major crackdown if they don't?

622
00:39:01,638 --> 00:39:03,361
What about your people?

623
00:39:03,656 --> 00:39:05,482
I got all my informants
putting out the word,

624
00:39:05,515 --> 00:39:07,210
but I'm not convinced
it's enough.

625
00:39:07,396 --> 00:39:08,913
You're the trump card.

626
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:11,761
All right,
I'll see what I can do.

627
00:39:11,995 --> 00:39:15,190
- I can't guarantee they'll listen.
- Thank you.

628
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:20,023
And, uh,
congratulations on your engagement.

629
00:39:21,676 --> 00:39:25,622
May I have my office contact
your office and set up a lunch?

630
00:39:25,836 --> 00:39:27,953
I'd like to talk to
you about your future.

631
00:39:28,156 --> 00:39:29,753
Yes, sure. Of course.

632
00:39:29,988 --> 00:39:32,343
Good. Thank you.

633
00:39:46,876 --> 00:39:49,152
Nick, hey.

634
00:39:49,778 --> 00:39:53,421
- How was your trip?
- Good, good. Great. Um...

635
00:39:54,296 --> 00:39:57,212
Why did I get frisked
on my way in here?

636
00:39:57,458 --> 00:39:59,533
Um... it's a long story.

637
00:40:00,557 --> 00:40:02,382
- Have you seen Ju...
- Julia.

638
00:40:02,627 --> 00:40:05,353
- Juliana.
- Juliana. Yes, yes, yes. Nice woman.

639
00:40:05,616 --> 00:40:07,863
Pulled a gun on me when
I walked in the door.

640
00:40:08,065 --> 00:40:10,023
Apologized, hugged me,

641
00:40:10,296 --> 00:40:12,651
told me I should,
uh, take care of you,

642
00:40:13,068 --> 00:40:16,211
and then, uh,
slipped out the back, Jack.

643
00:40:16,368 --> 00:40:18,073
Made a new plan, Stan.

644
00:40:18,225 --> 00:40:20,682
Um... she left this note.

645
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:28,733
Sorry I dragged you into this,
stay safe. Jules.

646
00:40:45,465 --> 00:40:47,722
<i>Hour 8 - 10:19 PM</i>

647
00:40:52,005 --> 00:40:53,780
Hi. Who do you belong to?

648
00:40:54,056 --> 00:40:56,390
- Those two.
- You?

649
00:40:56,826 --> 00:41:00,333
- That your daughter?
- God, where did that come from?

650
00:41:00,568 --> 00:41:03,592
- Let's go.
- Gunshots from inside the bank, 
northeast corner.

651
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,523
Repeat, gunshots from
inside the bank.

652
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:12,621
S.W.A.T., prepare to go green.

653
00:41:12,878 --> 00:41:15,110
- Repeat, prepare to go green.
- What does that mean?

654
00:41:15,145 --> 00:41:16,740
They're going in.
