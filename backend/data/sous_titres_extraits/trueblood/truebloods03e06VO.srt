1
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:34,360
Guess who turned out to be
completely unworthy of our trust.

2
00:00:36,026 --> 00:00:37,662
Why? What's happened?

3
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:39,991
He's been hiding something very...

4
00:00:40,116 --> 00:00:41,707
interesting from us all.

5
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,262
Are you serious?

6
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,349
I am almost 3000 years old.

7
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,205
Eric, get her out of here, please.

8
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:07,650
Eric, what are you doing?

9
00:01:08,298 --> 00:01:10,342
I wouldn't let go of this
if I were you.

10
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:14,031
I don't know what it is,
but I do know it's quite valuable.

11
00:02:48,306 --> 00:02:49,794
Eric, what the fuck?

12
00:02:50,863 --> 00:02:53,178
I've not had the pleasure
of tasting it,

13
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,231
but all my instincts say
it would be quite extraordinary.

14
00:02:59,425 --> 00:03:02,500
I will never,
ever forgive you for this.

15
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:06,802
It thinks we're equals.

16
00:03:07,038 --> 00:03:08,103
But it's wrong.

17
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:10,019
- Isn't it?
- Indeed.

18
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:15,110
Do you care nothing about our home?

19
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,196
- Talbot, not now.
- When?

20
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:27,456
What are you going to do
with our Mr. Compton,

21
00:03:27,929 --> 00:03:29,079
if I may ask?

22
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:33,003
Marco, Klaus, take Mr. Compton
to the slave quarters.

23
00:03:37,179 --> 00:03:38,801
There, my dear, you will kill him.

24
00:03:40,156 --> 00:03:42,221
- But what's...?
- Do not defy me!

25
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,720
I am your king!

26
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,061
Your Majesty.

27
00:03:52,147 --> 00:03:53,941
Take Miss Stackhouse
into the library, Eric.

28
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:56,026
I wanna ask her a few questions

29
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,404
after I repair the state
of affairs of my marriage.

30
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,990
Bill, I will get you out of here.

31
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,367
You save her, I beg you.

32
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:05,119
If you do kill him...

33
00:04:06,617 --> 00:04:07,917
I will kill you.

34
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,583
Please.

35
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,001
Please try.

36
00:04:13,223 --> 00:04:15,671
Without that sanctimonious
little prick, Godric,

37
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,038
to save you,

38
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,464
I would just love to rip you open

39
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:22,410
and wear your rib cage

40
00:04:23,073 --> 00:04:24,073
as a hat.

41
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,034
Please tell me you were just doing that
for the king's benefit.

42
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:39,854
I don't think anyone plays the king
of Mississippi and gets away with it.

43
00:04:40,936 --> 00:04:42,865
I certainly have no intentions
of trying.

44
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:49,014
Why are you even here?
You had other things to deal with.

45
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:50,501
I do, and I need to think.

46
00:04:50,626 --> 00:04:52,875
So please don't take this
the wrong way, but shut up.

47
00:04:53,115 --> 00:04:54,935
Eric, please, I'm begging you...

48
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,549
What is your...

49
00:05:03,265 --> 00:05:04,873
vegetable of the day?

50
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,555
That would be the peas.

51
00:05:10,254 --> 00:05:11,769
How are those prepared?

52
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:15,147
Those are dumped out of a can
into a big pot and heated up.

53
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,566
Where do you think you are, lady,
Red Lobster?

54
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,938
I am paying good money to eat here.

55
00:05:20,063 --> 00:05:21,980
You wanna keep
any of that cheap dyed hair

56
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:23,739
you better stop mouthing off to me.

57
00:05:26,196 --> 00:05:27,396
Tap the titty.

58
00:05:29,307 --> 00:05:30,407
That sucked.

59
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,454
And not in a good way.

60
00:05:34,957 --> 00:05:37,307
- Lafayette, I got an order.
- What?

61
00:05:37,973 --> 00:05:40,647
Sam and Tommy already done gone.
Ain't we closed yet?

62
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,300
Curlers over there
wants the chicken fried steak,

63
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,552
extra gravy on the side, extra mash,

64
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:46,949
no veggies.

65
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:50,641
- Hell, no.
- You want me to help?

66
00:05:51,076 --> 00:05:52,101
Can you cook?

67
00:05:52,526 --> 00:05:54,019
I can do a lot of things.

68
00:05:57,496 --> 00:05:58,496
Oh, Lordy.

69
00:06:00,307 --> 00:06:03,207
"And I want a freshly cut
lemon in my iced tea,

70
00:06:03,332 --> 00:06:06,560
" not some dried-out thing
that's been sitting around all day."

71
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,659
Dagnabbit.

72
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,321
Look what I just did.

73
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,705
I got lemon juice on it too.

74
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,292
Sorry. Arlene,
sometimes it just happens.

75
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,870
Please don't kill me.
I'm pregnant.

76
00:06:20,858 --> 00:06:23,549
That probably just makes
you wanna eat me even more.

77
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,887
This is why people hate y'all.

78
00:06:30,827 --> 00:06:32,777
I just haven't eaten in days.

79
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:44,746
I love how warm you are.

80
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,023
I feel like I'm on fire.

81
00:06:50,122 --> 00:06:51,122
Me too.

82
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,056
That's because we are...

83
00:06:56,471 --> 00:06:57,471
on fire.

84
00:07:03,575 --> 00:07:04,757
I ain't no virgin.

85
00:07:06,045 --> 00:07:07,095
Me neither.

86
00:07:08,677 --> 00:07:10,677
But you make me feel like one.

87
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,497
Not me.

88
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:15,619
You make me feel
like 110 percent woman.

89
00:07:19,811 --> 00:07:21,795
Don't hurt me.
Or do.

90
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:23,994
I don't care.

91
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,435
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

92
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,616
I ain't into any pervert stuff.

93
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,408
What?
I didn't mean it like that.

94
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:35,412
Then what in blazes
was it you did mean?

95
00:07:37,343 --> 00:07:38,343
I meant...

96
00:07:42,914 --> 00:07:44,464
Don't break my heart.

97
00:07:47,783 --> 00:07:48,768
What did I say?

98
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,387
This ain't right.

99
00:07:53,128 --> 00:07:54,128
It ain't

100
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:58,218
I wanted to just get a taste
of something

101
00:07:58,343 --> 00:08:00,395
I could remember forever, but...

102
00:08:00,745 --> 00:08:03,545
Goddamn it, I ain't gonna
let you see me cry.

103
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:08,862
There's no reason for you to cry.

104
00:08:10,103 --> 00:08:11,803
Not when you're with me.

105
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,637
I'll take care of you.

106
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:37,999
I gotta go.

107
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,010
Keep it down.

108
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:47,276
- I ain't letting you go.
- Ain't nobody owns me.

109
00:08:48,173 --> 00:08:49,742
When am I gonna see you again?

110
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,406
Never. This can't happen.
It's too dangerous.

111
00:08:52,912 --> 00:08:54,074
Dangerous? Why?

112
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,327
Just forget me, for both our sakes.

113
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:12,065
So all that stuff about caring
about me, that was just crap?

114
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,288
I never said I cared about you.
Maybe you dreamt it.

115
00:09:15,413 --> 00:09:17,973
You big phony.
Big hat, no cattle.

116
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,179
Do you mind?
I'm trying to think here.

117
00:09:20,304 --> 00:09:23,235
I thought you said my life was
too valuable to throw away.

118
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,731
You are valuable, that's very clear.

119
00:09:26,072 --> 00:09:27,665
I'm just not sure why.

120
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,485
"I'm risking everything,
because you mean so much to me.

121
00:09:30,941 --> 00:09:32,368
"You make me feel almost human."

122
00:09:33,191 --> 00:09:35,699
You mean nothing to me,
understand? Nothing.

123
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,454
I'm close to getting something
I've wanted since I was still human.

124
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,206
Do not get in my way.

125
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:47,634
I hate your fucking guts,
Eric Northman.

126
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,588
I promise I will
pay you back for this.

127
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:53,195
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

128
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,010
A husband's work is never done.

129
00:09:58,888 --> 00:10:00,765
- Leave us.
- As you wish.

130
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:11,443
Now, tell me what you are.

131
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,862
I'm a waitress.

132
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,781
Yes, and I am Marie of Romania.

133
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,619
I'm a very patient man,
Miss Stackhouse.

134
00:10:21,106 --> 00:10:23,610
One can afford to be
when one is immortal.

135
00:10:23,735 --> 00:10:26,250
But my patience
is not without limits.

136
00:10:36,582 --> 00:10:39,137
God, I hate leaving the kids
with Terry this long.

137
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,041
He's always so frazzled
when I get home.

138
00:10:45,216 --> 00:10:46,616
Where's Lafayette?

139
00:10:47,415 --> 00:10:49,265
He and that Jesus guy left.

140
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,775
Said to tell you to lock up
before you leave.

141
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,446
But just so you know,
this necklace is pure silver,

142
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,700
and I take garlic supplements too.

143
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:03,905
Just because my fangs popped out,
doesn't mean I'm gonna use 'em on you.

144
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,340
I just wish this awful night
was over.

145
00:11:08,817 --> 00:11:12,113
You know every single one
of my customers stiffed me?

146
00:11:14,868 --> 00:11:16,786
Let me take care of her for you.

147
00:11:19,302 --> 00:11:21,638
Don't kill her or anything.

148
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:27,602
Excuse me, ma'am?

149
00:11:32,246 --> 00:11:33,734
You're not hungry anymore.

150
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,198
I want you take all the money you have
and leave it on the table

151
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,492
then head to the ladies', alrighty?

152
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:51,143
She'll be gone soon.

153
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:19,799
You okay in there?

154
00:12:23,293 --> 00:12:24,293
Ma'am?

155
00:12:26,727 --> 00:12:28,127
Thank you so much.

156
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,578
You are the best waitress
I've ever had.

157
00:12:37,813 --> 00:12:39,579
Not such a bad night after all, huh?

158
00:12:39,704 --> 00:12:41,885
You got a nice tip
and nobody got killed.

159
00:12:42,421 --> 00:12:43,570
See you tomorrow.

160
00:12:49,178 --> 00:12:50,314
No fucking way.

161
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:51,749
So what?

162
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:53,541
I was born here.

163
00:12:54,162 --> 00:12:56,105
You never wanted to leave?

164
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:59,925
Ever since the day I was born.

165
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,791
I've been places,
I just never stayed.

166
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,623
I've always come back here.

167
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:08,459
You're not done with this place.

168
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:14,637
Feels like it's not done with me.
So where you from?

169
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,481
- I was born in Catemaco.
- Catemaco.

170
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,382
But <i>mi mami</i> dragged me
all over the fucking globe.

171
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:25,904
Texas, Uruguay...

172
00:13:27,814 --> 00:13:29,349
Portugal, you name it.

173
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:30,892
Montreal.

174
00:13:31,474 --> 00:13:32,436
<i>No papi?</i>

175
00:13:34,508 --> 00:13:35,680
No, I've got one.

176
00:13:37,137 --> 00:13:39,287
It's just nobody knows who he is.

177
00:13:42,297 --> 00:13:43,488
<i>Mami</i> was raped.

178
00:13:44,392 --> 00:13:45,449
Get the fuck out.

179
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,963
Makes all those jokes your mom
cracks about me raping her

180
00:13:52,088 --> 00:13:53,488
that much funnier.

181
00:13:57,642 --> 00:13:59,296
Maybe I was wrong about you.

182
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,981
Maybe I actually can relate

183
00:14:03,892 --> 00:14:04,885
to you.

184
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:09,159
Why would you think
that you couldn't?

185
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:13,603
Does term "Satan in a Sunday hat"
mean anything to you?

186
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:17,020
Bitch, my name is Jesus, bro.

187
00:14:17,145 --> 00:14:19,232
I am the polar opposite of Satan.

188
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:21,127
You'd better be.

189
00:14:23,893 --> 00:14:24,988
Can I kiss you?

190
00:14:28,637 --> 00:14:29,637
Fuck me.

191
00:14:30,513 --> 00:14:32,280
I shouldn't have asked.

192
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:34,748
I should have done it.

193
00:14:41,245 --> 00:14:42,845
I have a rule, though.

194
00:14:45,376 --> 00:14:46,968
No sex on the first date.

195
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,728
Sometimes I have a hard time
keeping that rule.

196
00:14:58,604 --> 00:15:01,191
I think we should follow that rule.

197
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:07,322
- Give us somewhere to go.
- Yeah, right.

198
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:09,341
Unless...

199
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:13,578
Because I'm feeling something
all kind of intense with you.

200
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,196
- Are you?
- Yeah.

201
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:20,389
I'm not sure I should trust it.

202
00:15:23,848 --> 00:15:25,674
I'm getting kind of hard
just looking at you.

203
00:15:27,933 --> 00:15:28,933
Damn.

204
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,200
Isn't it warm out for a fire?

205
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:10,536
I suppose it is.
I love a good fire.

206
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:12,429
There's something

207
00:16:13,616 --> 00:16:14,885
primal about it.

208
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:18,011
Always makes things more dramatic.

209
00:16:20,876 --> 00:16:21,876
Now...

210
00:16:23,976 --> 00:16:26,520
it's time for you
to answer my questions.

211
00:16:29,152 --> 00:16:31,531
Fine. I have some questions
for you too.

212
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,510
Honey.

213
00:16:33,717 --> 00:16:36,767
There's a fine line
between feisty and delusional.

214
00:16:37,383 --> 00:16:39,205
You're not really
in any position to bargain.

215
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:42,379
- You don't know that.
- Now it's getting interesting.

216
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:46,171
So I'll answer one of your questions
and you'll answer one of mine?

217
00:16:47,372 --> 00:16:48,381
Who goes first?

218
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,580
Are you the king of all vampires?

219
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,985
Heavens no, my dear girl.

220
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,107
I am merely the king of Mississippi.

221
00:16:56,232 --> 00:16:58,767
- Do you have a crown?
- I have several.

222
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:02,151
That's two questions.
My turn.

223
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,881
What are you?

224
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,442
You're definitely not human.

225
00:17:08,073 --> 00:17:10,487
- My parents were human.
- How do you know?

226
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:13,156
And how do you know they were
your parents, for that matter?

227
00:17:14,485 --> 00:17:15,992
My grandfather was like me.

228
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:19,245
Which is?

229
00:17:21,255 --> 00:17:23,205
I can hear people's thoughts.

230
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:26,268
And shifters', werewolves'.

231
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,089
Not vampires'.

232
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,634
How dreadful that must be.

233
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,108
Oh, you have no idea.

234
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,554
Who cares
what anyone else is thinking?

235
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:38,973
My turn.

236
00:17:42,908 --> 00:17:44,708
Is Lorena gonna kill Bill?

237
00:17:48,699 --> 00:17:50,276
If she knows what's good for her.

238
00:17:51,456 --> 00:17:53,206
But she'll take her time.

239
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,924
He's been her drug of choice
for centuries now.

240
00:17:56,882 --> 00:17:59,202
She's gonna have a hard time
letting go.

241
00:17:59,655 --> 00:18:00,655
Please.

242
00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:03,422
You can stop her.

243
00:18:04,061 --> 00:18:05,542
Why would you want me to?

244
00:18:08,204 --> 00:18:09,354
Are you aware

245
00:18:09,998 --> 00:18:11,998
that your noble Mr. Compton...

246
00:18:14,524 --> 00:18:16,428
has been keeping
a secret file on you?

247
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,187
On your family?

248
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,899
- What the...?
- My turn.

249
00:18:31,955 --> 00:18:34,055
What are you besides a telepath?

250
00:18:34,463 --> 00:18:36,619
And what on Earth makes that light

251
00:18:37,281 --> 00:18:38,825
come out of your hands?

252
00:18:41,878 --> 00:18:44,080
Don't make me force it out of you.

253
00:18:45,581 --> 00:18:46,731
I don't know.

254
00:18:47,871 --> 00:18:49,794
I never even knew I could do it
until recently,

255
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,776
and I don't know what I am.

256
00:18:52,492 --> 00:18:53,631
Maybe I'm an alien.

257
00:18:54,184 --> 00:18:55,633
All I know is it's something big,

258
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,261
so if I were you I wouldn't hurt me
or anyone I care about.

259
00:18:58,858 --> 00:19:00,597
- Are there other powers?
- It's my turn.

260
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:08,922
Are there other powers?

261
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,109
Once I threw a chain at somebody

262
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:13,450
and it wrapped around his neck
by itself,

263
00:19:13,575 --> 00:19:15,746
like that face-crab thing
from <i>Alien</i>.

264
00:19:17,694 --> 00:19:18,615
That's all.

265
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,580
No wonder the queen is so...

266
00:19:27,311 --> 00:19:28,762
fascinated by you.

267
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:30,500
There's a queen?

268
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:32,709
Sweetheart.

269
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:35,256
You really don't know
anything at all, do you?

270
00:19:46,174 --> 00:19:48,709
I do miss the 1930s.

271
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:51,566
Such style,

272
00:19:52,477 --> 00:19:53,477
elegance.

273
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:58,179
People knew how to behave,

274
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,325
and what was expected of them.

275
00:20:04,424 --> 00:20:06,955
They knew how to avoid
creating tragedies,

276
00:20:08,216 --> 00:20:09,916
for the people they loved.

277
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,766
I may not be able
to make you feel...

278
00:20:16,228 --> 00:20:17,683
anything for me,

279
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,342
but...

280
00:20:22,362 --> 00:20:24,118
I will make you feel.

281
00:20:25,272 --> 00:20:28,906
You have always so enjoyed
making others suffer.

282
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,570
And there's nothing wrong with that.

283
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,649
Especially having been made
to suffer...

284
00:20:35,249 --> 00:20:36,499
as I have been.

285
00:20:37,085 --> 00:20:40,192
You haven't suffered
at the hands of others

286
00:20:40,317 --> 00:20:42,699
for a very long time.

287
00:20:42,938 --> 00:20:45,493
I am suffering now.

288
00:21:05,589 --> 00:21:06,589
Please,

289
00:21:08,085 --> 00:21:09,285
do it quickly.

290
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:25,461
Even as you face the true death...

291
00:21:27,087 --> 00:21:28,637
I will be inside you.

292
00:21:29,702 --> 00:21:31,497
Not Sookie,

293
00:21:33,296 --> 00:21:34,296
me.

294
00:21:37,982 --> 00:21:41,015
I wish I had known you
before you were made,

295
00:21:41,594 --> 00:21:43,461
before you turned hard.

296
00:21:44,194 --> 00:21:46,965
I would've liked
to have seen you smile,

297
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:50,902
with light in your eyes...

298
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,062
instead of darkness.

299
00:21:59,316 --> 00:22:00,316
That...

300
00:22:01,177 --> 00:22:02,978
would have been something.

301
00:22:12,424 --> 00:22:14,283
I have no choice.

302
00:22:32,162 --> 00:22:33,412
Where you been?

303
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,521
Tara, I will not be policed.

304
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,309
Of course not. I'm not pol...

305
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,629
I just really missed you, Franklin.

306
00:22:42,209 --> 00:22:44,409
Couldn't wait for you to get back.

307
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:46,155
Really?

308
00:22:46,855 --> 00:22:48,157
It's hard to believe.

309
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,494
You haven't even noticed
that I've shaved.

310
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:53,454
I wanted to...

311
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:56,223
I wanted to look nice for you.

312
00:22:56,536 --> 00:22:58,638
It's our wedding night tomorrow.

313
00:22:59,605 --> 00:23:01,832
By the way, your friend Sookie,

314
00:23:02,989 --> 00:23:04,298
she's been brought here.

315
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,039
What is Russell gonna do to her?

316
00:23:06,164 --> 00:23:08,302
So that means

317
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,263
my work for Russell
is officially over,

318
00:23:11,105 --> 00:23:13,474
which means you've got me...

319
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,129
all to yourself.

320
00:23:19,536 --> 00:23:22,071
Don't promise me something
you can't deliver, now.

321
00:23:30,982 --> 00:23:31,982
Untie me.

322
00:23:34,327 --> 00:23:36,456
Two hands are better than none.

323
00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:38,309
Why,

324
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:42,086
you wicked little strumpet.

325
00:24:00,855 --> 00:24:03,062
I'm gonna drink your blood
tomorrow night.

326
00:24:03,187 --> 00:24:05,520
- Oh, yes, you are.
- I want it now.

327
00:24:06,962 --> 00:24:09,816
I wanna experience
being high on you,

328
00:24:11,773 --> 00:24:14,327
while making love to you.

329
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,515
Knowing it's my last act as human,

330
00:24:18,174 --> 00:24:22,802
I wanna have the most amazing sex
any human can have,

331
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:25,338
before I give myself to you...

332
00:24:31,302 --> 00:24:32,302
Kinky.

333
00:24:33,808 --> 00:24:34,808
Fucked up.

334
00:24:35,442 --> 00:24:36,442
Crazy.

335
00:24:36,878 --> 00:24:38,437
- I'll go there.
- I bet you will.

336
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:39,827
- Will you?
- Bring it.

337
00:24:39,952 --> 00:24:40,937
Bite me.

338
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,930
Bite into my flesh, taste my blood,

339
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,301
my sinew, my bones.

340
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:49,746
Open me up.

341
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,864
Taste me, drink me,

342
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,408
feed on me.

343
00:24:55,985 --> 00:24:58,035
You don't have to ask me twice.

344
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,166
Fuck, yeah!

345
00:25:03,989 --> 00:25:04,752
Kill me.

346
00:25:05,654 --> 00:25:06,629
Kill me hard.

347
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:11,968
Kill me.

348
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:17,908
Wait a minute.

349
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,957
That's not how you play Kaiserspiel.

350
00:25:20,082 --> 00:25:22,584
Kaiserspiel?
We're playing Karnoffel.

351
00:25:24,493 --> 00:25:25,493
I'm sorry.

352
00:25:27,827 --> 00:25:29,652
I haven't played this game
in centuries.

353
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,363
Russell taught me this game
when I was still human.

354
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,073
How long have you been together?

355
00:25:34,845 --> 00:25:36,834
Just shy of 700 years.

356
00:25:38,033 --> 00:25:40,705
Although sometimes
it feels like 7 million.

357
00:25:43,995 --> 00:25:46,502
Well, I hope he knows
just how lucky he is.

358
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:48,629
Believe me...

359
00:25:50,197 --> 00:25:52,383
- he knows.
- Get your hands off me!

360
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,594
- Carlo! Take this.
- Let go of me.

361
00:25:55,143 --> 00:25:57,513
- And have Timothy bring the car around.
- Let me go!

362
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,473
- Where are you going?
- I have business.

363
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,184
- Again?
- Yes.

364
00:26:03,481 --> 00:26:04,481
Save Bill!

365
00:26:09,482 --> 00:26:11,944
Would you accompany me this evening?

366
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:15,781
- It would be an honor.
- You never take me anywhere.

367
00:26:16,273 --> 00:26:18,784
Because you prefer
to be in the company of sycophants.

368
00:26:23,034 --> 00:26:24,745
Deep down, my darling,

369
00:26:25,765 --> 00:26:27,715
you're a very weak character.

370
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:32,379
He's in one of his moods.

371
00:26:33,948 --> 00:26:34,998
Never mind.

372
00:26:35,883 --> 00:26:37,997
We have much more pressing
matters at hand.

373
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,224
We're gonna see
an old friend of yours.

374
00:26:48,929 --> 00:26:51,225
Get your creepy hands off me!

375
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,750
I have powers!
I'll use them, I will!

376
00:27:20,964 --> 00:27:23,284
<i>Don't worry, Sookie,
I'm gonna get you out.</i>

377
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:26,545
<i>Wait until the sun comes up.
I'll find you. Be ready.</i>

378
00:27:28,214 --> 00:27:30,736
<i>Because we're gonna need
all the luck in the world,</i>

379
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,834
<i>but I'm gonna get us out of here.</i>

380
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,250
<i>I'm not giving up without a fight.</i>

381
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:38,341
You have no idea
what awaits you on the other side,

382
00:27:39,515 --> 00:27:41,160
my beautiful bride.

383
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,550
No more pain.

384
00:27:46,074 --> 00:27:47,224
No more fear.

385
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:51,261
No more rules.

386
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:00,136
Tell me, Eric...

387
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:02,762
- May I call you Eric?
- Certainly.

388
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:06,910
What exactly is your relationship
with Miss Stackhouse?

389
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:09,703
Well, her lover, Bill Compton, is...

390
00:28:09,974 --> 00:28:11,939
Was a constituent of mine.

391
00:28:13,052 --> 00:28:14,317
I'd keep an eye on that

392
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:16,237
because she was of interest
to my queen.

393
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:18,946
So, no personal attachments?

394
00:28:19,626 --> 00:28:21,945
I do not get attached to humans.

395
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:26,003
Still, you have to admit,
she is quite delectable.

396
00:28:27,348 --> 00:28:29,676
My tastes lie elsewhere.

397
00:28:39,165 --> 00:28:42,214
Lorena thinks
you killed one of my werewolves.

398
00:28:43,081 --> 00:28:46,210
I killed a werewolf.
I was not aware it belonged to you.

399
00:28:46,335 --> 00:28:47,266
To save Sookie?

400
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,684
To save myself.

401
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,811
I wanted to question her

402
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,038
regarding Bill's disappearance,
and it attacked me.

403
00:28:53,163 --> 00:28:55,247
Only a very young
and very foolish vampire

404
00:28:55,372 --> 00:28:57,526
could be killed by a werewolf.
You are neither.

405
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:01,389
Only a vampire with no self-respect
would save this werewolf.

406
00:29:01,912 --> 00:29:03,366
They are primitive creatures,

407
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:05,822
and I will freely admit
that I despise them.

408
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:08,332
You're the first vampire I met
who didn't feel the same way.

409
00:29:08,457 --> 00:29:09,707
Of course I do.

410
00:29:10,242 --> 00:29:12,890
They're more dog than man.
Stupider than dogs, actually.

411
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:16,684
But it seems beneficial to me...

412
00:29:17,312 --> 00:29:18,412
to use them,

413
00:29:19,147 --> 00:29:20,674
rather than destroy them.

414
00:29:21,423 --> 00:29:23,052
How exactly do you use them?

415
00:29:25,978 --> 00:29:27,390
I give them the blood.

416
00:29:29,877 --> 00:29:33,020
Come, now. I know that you yourself
have been dealing,

417
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,023
so don't pretend
to be a vampire fundamentalist.

418
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,775
If all the supernaturals would stop

419
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,708
squabbling among themselves
and unite,

420
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:42,530
we could conquer humans
in a matter of days.

421
00:29:42,986 --> 00:29:45,825
- This is your plan?
- I prefer to call it my dream.

422
00:29:46,383 --> 00:29:47,842
Well, I like this dream.

423
00:29:47,967 --> 00:29:49,816
Throughout history,
I have aligned myself with

424
00:29:49,941 --> 00:29:51,622
or destroyed those humans in power,

425
00:29:51,966 --> 00:29:53,787
hoping to make a dent

426
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,084
in mankind's race to oblivion.

427
00:29:57,494 --> 00:30:00,846
What other creature
actively destroys its own habitat?

428
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,649
You're preaching to the choir.

429
00:30:02,774 --> 00:30:05,293
I mean, do you remember
how the air used to smell?

430
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,596
How humans used to smell?

431
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,058
How they used to taste?

432
00:30:12,387 --> 00:30:14,884
I remember everything.

433
00:30:18,893 --> 00:30:22,319
Preening little fool that he was,
Adolf was right about one thing.

434
00:30:22,575 --> 00:30:24,225
There is a master race.

435
00:30:24,978 --> 00:30:26,740
It's just not the human race.

436
00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:33,789
Should we have taken the I-12 exit?

437
00:30:34,694 --> 00:30:36,167
We're not going to Shreveport.

438
00:30:38,612 --> 00:30:39,712
Don't worry.

439
00:30:41,078 --> 00:30:43,928
We'll deal
with your Magister problem in time.

440
00:30:51,511 --> 00:30:52,961
Well, this is my...

441
00:30:53,802 --> 00:30:55,085
humble abode.

442
00:30:58,767 --> 00:30:59,917
It's amazing.

443
00:31:01,064 --> 00:31:02,202
You think so?

444
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:03,944
And that...

445
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:06,979
That is beautiful.

446
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:08,998
That's my girl.

447
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:10,201
Tonantzin.

448
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,677
No, that's the Virgin Mary.

449
00:31:15,126 --> 00:31:16,373
But it's also...

450
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,620
Eleggua and Chango.

451
00:31:23,205 --> 00:31:25,074
These guys
are pretty fucking hard-core.

452
00:31:25,199 --> 00:31:26,605
What do you offer them?

453
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:30,721
Lafayette, man, these guys,
they have to be appeased, bro,

454
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,640
or else they will fuck you up.

455
00:31:33,295 --> 00:31:34,128
Seriously,

456
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:36,977
I sing for Eleggua.
I put out shots of tequila for Chango.

457
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,153
He drink 'em?

458
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:39,947
Smart-ass.

459
00:31:41,223 --> 00:31:42,316
He blesses 'em,

460
00:31:43,286 --> 00:31:44,886
and then I drink them.

461
00:31:45,662 --> 00:31:48,694
Well, maybe I should put out
a couple of shots for him right now.

462
00:31:50,331 --> 00:31:51,331
Or...

463
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:56,634
we could offer him something else.

464
00:32:18,624 --> 00:32:19,924
Evening, faggot.

465
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:21,748
Bitch.

466
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:24,377
First your fucking non-American car,
faggot.

467
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,737
We gonna fuck you up, cocksucker.

468
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,072
Yeah, fucker.

469
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,866
- Shit.
- Last time you fuck with me.

470
00:32:33,364 --> 00:32:34,868
- Dumb-ass hillbilly.
- Shit.

471
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:38,974
Make no mistake, cracker.

472
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:40,916
You're gonna get
my fucking ride fixed.

473
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,209
How am I supposed...

474
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,376
Ain't my fucking problem.

475
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:48,007
Why don't you just sell all that shit
I dropped by your house last night?

476
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:50,092
I ain't selling no vampire blood.
It's evil.

477
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,910
And crystal meth ain't?

478
00:32:56,562 --> 00:32:58,183
Calm down, man. You got him.

479
00:32:58,891 --> 00:33:00,404
Get the fuck out of here.

480
00:33:00,529 --> 00:33:03,694
Go tell your mama
two faggots whupped your ass, bitch!

481
00:33:03,819 --> 00:33:04,819
Come on.

482
00:33:08,505 --> 00:33:09,653
Are you a drug dealer?

483
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,245
And V?

484
00:33:19,315 --> 00:33:21,799
Man, that shit's so intense,
it ruins most people's lives.

485
00:33:23,349 --> 00:33:24,735
You know what, man?

486
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,760
Just take me back to my car.

487
00:33:31,996 --> 00:33:33,927
Whatever you want, bitch.

488
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:46,231
Ludis! Another hundred dollars.

489
00:33:46,994 --> 00:33:49,026
Hadley, Ludis,
go down to the Circle K.

490
00:33:49,295 --> 00:33:51,737
Get me a couple hundred more
Deuces Wild tickets.

491
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,322
Mama's feeling lucky tonight.

492
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,474
Mama couldn't be more wrong.

493
00:34:00,493 --> 00:34:02,706
- You killed my guards.
- Only a handful.

494
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,042
The rest were surprisingly
unwilling to die for you

495
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,610
and have defected.

496
00:34:06,966 --> 00:34:07,964
Hadley?

497
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:11,590
Your human is safe.
I'm not here to needlessly slaughter.

498
00:34:12,828 --> 00:34:14,593
- What do you want?
- You,

499
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:17,346
my darling Sophie Anne.

500
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:19,756
I want you...

501
00:34:19,881 --> 00:34:22,017
to accept my proposal of marriage.

502
00:34:22,192 --> 00:34:24,960
I've turned you down
countless times.

503
00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:26,936
Why would I accept now?

504
00:34:27,061 --> 00:34:29,197
Because in addition
to never touching you,

505
00:34:29,322 --> 00:34:31,381
I will settle all your debts.

506
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,112
Come on.

507
00:34:33,774 --> 00:34:35,614
The Magister
will eventually determine

508
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,616
it was you
who was selling our blood.

509
00:34:37,793 --> 00:34:40,343
I've already pinned it
on Eric Northman.

510
00:34:41,113 --> 00:34:42,747
Is that really all you've got?

511
00:34:44,075 --> 00:34:45,592
There's the IRS.

512
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:47,969
The American Vampire League
will let them put you in prison,

513
00:34:48,094 --> 00:34:50,379
make an example of you,
assuage the right wing's fears

514
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:52,965
about vampires running Wall Street.

515
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:57,136
They have no dominion over me.
I'm a queen.

516
00:35:03,237 --> 00:35:06,101
I have known some of the finest queens
who've ever lived.

517
00:35:06,226 --> 00:35:07,078
You,

518
00:35:07,416 --> 00:35:08,689
my dear girl,

519
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,066
are no queen.

520
00:35:12,405 --> 00:35:13,777
Go fuck yourself.

521
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,243
Sweetheart, you go fuck yourself.

522
00:35:24,325 --> 00:35:26,598
I am older and stronger than you.

523
00:35:27,221 --> 00:35:29,877
I only submitted to you in the past
because of respect.

524
00:35:30,147 --> 00:35:32,546
But you framed me.

525
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,300
So I renounce any
and all allegiance to you.

526
00:35:38,819 --> 00:35:39,928
I am his now.

527
00:35:41,096 --> 00:35:43,262
I refuse to grant you...

528
00:35:43,387 --> 00:35:46,226
I will rip your head off
and throw it in the pool.

529
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,470
And I will have fun doing it.

530
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:53,233
Your call.

531
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,111
Very well, then.

532
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,419
So, yes or no?

533
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:17,806
Goddamn it.

534
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,608
Splendid.

535
00:36:21,462 --> 00:36:22,679
Sun will be up soon.

536
00:36:23,577 --> 00:36:26,517
We'll spend the day here.
We'll stop by Fangtasia

537
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,936
- on our way back to Jackson.
- As you wish.

538
00:36:29,596 --> 00:36:31,825
I hope I didn't overstep any boundaries
just now.

539
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:35,744
I quite enjoyed that.

540
00:36:38,101 --> 00:36:39,351
It is my honor,

541
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:41,317
and my duty,

542
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:45,902
my king.

543
00:36:50,428 --> 00:36:52,954
I'll make sure your betrothed
is properly restrained.

544
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:58,348
I want my Hadley!

545
00:37:14,312 --> 00:37:16,012
You should go to ground.

546
00:37:18,452 --> 00:37:19,570
And not be with you

547
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,408
when the life flows out of you?

548
00:37:22,755 --> 00:37:23,825
I cannot.

549
00:37:24,673 --> 00:37:25,951
And what will you do then?

550
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,774
Find another man
that you deem honorable?

551
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:38,570
So that you can turn him into a...

552
00:37:39,597 --> 00:37:42,520
violent, hateful thing
like yourself,

553
00:37:43,238 --> 00:37:46,674
destroying whatever it was
you loved about him to begin with?

554
00:37:48,862 --> 00:37:51,012
It's all my fault, isn't it?

555
00:37:51,988 --> 00:37:54,993
You never enjoyed
killing those humans,

556
00:37:56,082 --> 00:37:58,382
writhing naked in their blood,

557
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,112
making love to me
as the light died in their eyes.

558
00:38:04,839 --> 00:38:07,158
I forced you to do all that.

559
00:38:09,256 --> 00:38:10,356
You did not.

560
00:38:11,118 --> 00:38:12,168
Be a man...

561
00:38:14,096 --> 00:38:15,913
... and admit you liked it.

562
00:38:16,138 --> 00:38:17,538
Just as you liked,

563
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:22,052
enticing all those starving men
with your flesh,

564
00:38:23,118 --> 00:38:26,076
luring them
into your maker's clutches

565
00:38:26,373 --> 00:38:28,494
so that he could murder them,

566
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:34,149
and defile their bodies
in unspeakable ways as you watched.

567
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:38,106
I am not István.

568
00:38:38,395 --> 00:38:39,483
Really?

569
00:38:40,209 --> 00:38:41,859
He made you his mirror,

570
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:45,737
just as you tried to make me yours.

571
00:38:48,335 --> 00:38:50,346
He is the reason that a girl,

572
00:38:50,776 --> 00:38:53,940
who once marveled
in the beauty of all life,

573
00:38:55,122 --> 00:38:56,674
now delights in...

574
00:38:58,118 --> 00:38:59,822
bringing pain and horror

575
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:01,924
to every moment.

576
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,716
You never embraced our nature.

577
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,084
Your nature...

578
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:07,886
was never mine.

579
00:39:14,013 --> 00:39:15,562
I welcome death.

580
00:39:17,336 --> 00:39:18,605
Because only then...

581
00:39:19,622 --> 00:39:23,763
will I be truly free
of the disease...

582
00:39:25,235 --> 00:39:26,335
that is you.

583
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,575
Come on, Peaches.
We gotta get us some.

584
00:39:32,122 --> 00:39:33,376
Sorry, ma'am.

585
00:39:33,935 --> 00:39:37,033
We kind of thought you
would've retired for the day.

586
00:39:37,289 --> 00:39:40,289
Aren't you supposed
to be patrolling the grounds?

587
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,596
We was just gonna keep an eye
on your prisoner for you,

588
00:39:44,721 --> 00:39:46,425
make sure he didn't get away.

589
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:47,917
Really?

590
00:39:48,724 --> 00:39:50,974
And I suppose feasting on his blood

591
00:39:51,688 --> 00:39:53,308
never crossed your minds.

592
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:55,141
It's my fault, ma'am.

593
00:39:55,465 --> 00:39:57,217
I begged Coot to let me get some.

594
00:39:57,342 --> 00:39:59,708
And I got a bone to pick
with this asshole.

595
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:01,231
He jumped me last night,

596
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,150
killed three of my wolves last week.

597
00:40:04,587 --> 00:40:07,446
Come on.
Let us just have a little taste.

598
00:40:08,387 --> 00:40:10,824
It's just going to waste
all over the floor like that.

599
00:40:12,264 --> 00:40:13,118
Of course.

600
00:40:16,243 --> 00:40:17,743
Suck whatever's left

601
00:40:19,674 --> 00:40:20,674
right out of him.

602
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:24,445
Fuck, yeah!
Drink directly from the source, right?

603
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:29,426
This is for Louie, fanger.

604
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,890
And Darryl.

605
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:34,973
And Jimmy.

606
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:39,227
This is just 'cause I fucking
feel like it.

607
00:40:40,902 --> 00:40:42,773
You mind?
I'm trying to eat here.

608
00:40:44,163 --> 00:40:45,442
Come on, baby.

609
00:40:46,742 --> 00:40:50,377
Let's turn this here dead man
into a fucking raisin.

610
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:04,001
That is simply not true.

611
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,974
You can't hypnotize away
the facts, Miss Flanagan.

612
00:41:07,099 --> 00:41:10,133
Ratification would send
a bad message to our nation's children.

613
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,720
<i>It would be tantamount to
full-on government endorsement</i>

614
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,481
<i>of deviant vampiric behavior.</i>

615
00:41:16,834 --> 00:41:20,060
<i>The American people
are too smart for this fear-mongering.</i>

616
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,240
- <i>It's not fear-mongering.</i>
- <i>Please.</i>

617
00:41:22,365 --> 00:41:25,068
<i>We have all seen
that leaked fundraising presentation</i>

618
00:41:25,193 --> 00:41:27,442
<i>which outlines
an aggressive strategy</i>

619
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:31,028
<i>that's designed to capitalize
on fear and misinformation.</i>

620
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,991
<i>It's all a vast
right-wing conspiracy.</i>

621
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:40,109
<i>It's no accident at claims of how we
intend to prey on America's children...</i>

622
00:41:40,234 --> 00:41:42,272
Thanks for letting me crash here
last night.

623
00:41:45,382 --> 00:41:48,380
You gonna tell me what's going on
between you and Joe Lee?

624
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:50,749
Why he came after you last night?

625
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:55,002
- You scared of him?
- I ain't scared of him.

626
00:41:56,084 --> 00:41:57,384
I just hate him.

627
00:41:59,131 --> 00:42:00,491
He's a drunk.

628
00:42:00,616 --> 00:42:02,866
Gambles away any money we ever get.

629
00:42:03,917 --> 00:42:04,855
Fuck him.

630
00:42:08,335 --> 00:42:10,304
He's the one scarred you up?

631
00:42:10,892 --> 00:42:12,487
- He wishes.
- Don't lie to me.

632
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:15,307
I ain't lying.
He ain't never laid a hand on me.

633
00:42:15,677 --> 00:42:16,977
He knows better.

634
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,412
Well, there's something messed
up between you and him.

635
00:42:21,855 --> 00:42:25,167
Now, you may not wanna talk about it,
but we're gonna talk about it.

636
00:42:28,781 --> 00:42:31,482
But I'll talk about it
when I'm ready.

637
00:42:31,965 --> 00:42:34,031
Fair enough, long as it's today.

638
00:42:35,536 --> 00:42:36,469
Good morning.

639
00:42:37,251 --> 00:42:40,473
I brought y'all a mess
of my secret-recipe corn fritters

640
00:42:41,324 --> 00:42:42,924
fried in bacon grease.

641
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:45,562
You ain't had good
till you've had these, Sam.

642
00:42:47,001 --> 00:42:48,440
Thank you, Melinda.

643
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:50,684
When you gonna start
calling me Mama?

644
00:42:51,415 --> 00:42:53,612
Soon as it starts
to feel comfortable.

645
00:42:54,552 --> 00:42:56,281
Well, you take your time, darling.

646
00:42:57,581 --> 00:42:59,367
We got a lot of road to cover,
you and me.

647
00:43:01,479 --> 00:43:03,907
Can I have a little
heart-to-heart with my youngest?

648
00:43:07,033 --> 00:43:07,959
It's okay.

649
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,362
I'll just take these fritters
with me.

650
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,140
Put 'em on the lunch menu.

651
00:43:22,624 --> 00:43:23,882
You wait and see.

652
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:27,090
Folks will be lining up for them.

653
00:43:36,298 --> 00:43:39,241
"It's okay"? It's okay
for your own mama to talk to you?

654
00:43:39,685 --> 00:43:40,909
He's looking out for me.

655
00:43:41,909 --> 00:43:43,954
Wellho the hell's looking out
for me and for Joe Lee?

656
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:46,206
I don't give a shit of him.

657
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:47,654
Listen to me, little boy.

658
00:43:47,779 --> 00:43:49,668
You wouldn't be here
if it weren't for him.

659
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:53,046
I was ready to end my pregnancy
'cause it would take me off the circuit.

660
00:43:53,171 --> 00:43:55,830
It was Joe Lee who said I ought
to go ahead and have you,

661
00:43:55,955 --> 00:43:57,842
case you turned out to be
a shifter like me.

662
00:43:59,876 --> 00:44:01,010
What a saint.

663
00:44:01,387 --> 00:44:03,556
He wanted to use me
just like he'd been using you.

664
00:44:04,378 --> 00:44:06,893
That man ain't never left me
no matter what, and he could've.

665
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,747
You're the one that never left.

666
00:44:08,872 --> 00:44:11,531
He ain't leaving
because we're his goddamn meal ticket.

667
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:14,526
And what would we do without him?
You ever think about that?

668
00:44:15,342 --> 00:44:17,779
My back's done shot from all
the years I spent in the ring.

669
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:19,669
I ain't able to work now.

670
00:44:20,043 --> 00:44:22,158
You wanna just leave me to rot
in an alley somewhere?

671
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,266
Course no, Mama.

672
00:44:24,391 --> 00:44:27,622
I did it till I couldn't do it anymore,
and now it's your turn.

673
00:44:28,336 --> 00:44:29,332
It ain't right.

674
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,085
The world ain't right,
you selfish little shit.

675
00:44:32,777 --> 00:44:34,879
Without you, we ain't gonna survive.

676
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,297
We can't do it.

677
00:44:36,515 --> 00:44:38,967
- Yeah, but maybe with Sam's help...
- You can't trust Sam.

678
00:44:39,947 --> 00:44:41,219
He may be blood,

679
00:44:42,061 --> 00:44:43,471
but he ain't family.

680
00:44:44,689 --> 00:44:46,589
And he ain't never gonna be.

681
00:44:47,934 --> 00:44:49,434
He looks down on us.

682
00:44:50,243 --> 00:44:52,093
Thinks he's better than us.

683
00:44:52,614 --> 00:44:55,076
- Yeah, maybe he is.
- Yeah, maybe the fuck he is.

684
00:44:55,201 --> 00:44:57,819
But you think he's willing
to take care of us over the long haul

685
00:44:57,987 --> 00:44:59,432
once he knows the truth?

686
00:45:02,725 --> 00:45:04,367
Me and Joe Lee's all you got, son,

687
00:45:05,232 --> 00:45:06,661
all you ever will have.

688
00:45:08,312 --> 00:45:11,062
And in your bones,
you know that to be true.

689
00:45:17,013 --> 00:45:17,863
Fuck.

690
00:47:15,775 --> 00:47:17,366
Who the hell are you?

691
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:20,545
I'm here to see Crystal.

692
00:47:20,954 --> 00:47:21,838
What for?

693
00:47:22,765 --> 00:47:24,966
That's between me and Crystal.

694
00:47:27,939 --> 00:47:28,989
Is that so?

695
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:33,249
All right.

696
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:35,869
Babe.

697
00:47:36,992 --> 00:47:38,742
Somebody here to see you.

698
00:47:44,659 --> 00:47:46,321
Who the hell are you?

699
00:47:47,023 --> 00:47:49,163
What? Crystal, it's me, Jason.

700
00:47:49,893 --> 00:47:51,117
It's a joke?

701
00:47:51,968 --> 00:47:53,495
I ain't never laid eyes on you.

702
00:47:55,534 --> 00:47:57,459
I don't know
who put you up to this or why,

703
00:47:57,584 --> 00:47:58,833
but it's not funny.

704
00:47:59,106 --> 00:48:01,961
And I'd appreciate it
if you'd leave and my fiancé alone.

705
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,137
- Fiancé?
- You heard the lady, asshole.

706
00:48:07,294 --> 00:48:09,626
Why don't you get off our land
before we kick you off?

707
00:48:09,751 --> 00:48:10,803
Yeah, dumb-ass.

708
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:17,570
What's taking so long?

709
00:48:19,416 --> 00:48:21,500
Bitch already said
she ain't know you.

710
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,107
Sorry, ma'am.

711
00:48:23,362 --> 00:48:25,276
Must have confused you
with somebody else.

712
00:48:33,589 --> 00:48:34,839
You showed him.

713
00:48:37,383 --> 00:48:39,027
Whoever the hell he was.

714
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,874
- That little blond girl isin there?
- What's it to you?

715
00:48:51,999 --> 00:48:53,976
Talbot's serving her blood
for dinner,

716
00:48:54,101 --> 00:48:55,920
and she's only supposed
to be eating almonds.

717
00:48:56,045 --> 00:48:59,026
- That's what it is to me.
- Nobody told me about almonds.

718
00:48:59,151 --> 00:49:01,293
If she ain't eating that,
Talbot ain't gonna be happy.

719
00:49:01,418 --> 00:49:03,147
If he ain't happy,
Russell ain't happy.

720
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:06,912
If Russell ain't happy, you dogs
ain't getting any vampire blood.

721
00:49:07,037 --> 00:49:08,970
Now open up the goddamn door.

722
00:49:18,842 --> 00:49:21,332
Great. You fell asleep
and let her escape?

723
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:37,932
- Come on.
- What the hell are you doing?

724
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,726
Killing vampires
and saving your ass.

725
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:42,676
I'll fill you in later. Now
let's get the hell out of here.

726
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:46,930
Eggs over easy, sausage,
white toast.

727
00:49:47,055 --> 00:49:48,833
And he wants them eggs runny...

728
00:49:48,958 --> 00:49:51,237
I know what over easy mean,
goddamn it.

729
00:49:51,977 --> 00:49:54,344
Well, you're in a sorry mood today.

730
00:49:54,469 --> 00:49:56,534
That's right, I am in a fucking
sorry-ass mood.

731
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,828
You got a fucking problem with that?

732
00:50:03,374 --> 00:50:04,685
Have you seen Tommy?

733
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:07,521
No, and I got two tables
need busing.

734
00:50:08,304 --> 00:50:09,304
Oh, and, Sam?

735
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:13,343
I thought you had a no-pet policy
on those apartments.

736
00:50:13,923 --> 00:50:14,773
I do.

737
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:17,764
I see.
Unless it's your kinfolk?

738
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,346
I don't appreciate you
letting them have that dog

739
00:50:20,471 --> 00:50:22,185
when Coby and Lisa
can't have a hamster.

740
00:50:22,771 --> 00:50:23,721
What dog?

741
00:50:24,279 --> 00:50:26,064
That mean-ass looking pit bull

742
00:50:26,393 --> 00:50:29,207
that your mama and daddy brought out
and piled into their van this morning.

743
00:50:29,332 --> 00:50:30,832
Like you don't know.

744
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,529
I got kids, Sam.
I can't be having some killer dog...

745
00:50:34,121 --> 00:50:36,498
Damn, everybody's ignoring me today.

746
00:50:54,168 --> 00:50:55,218
Goddamn it.

747
00:50:56,179 --> 00:50:58,410
He's got werewolves
patrolling the grounds by day.

748
00:50:58,535 --> 00:51:00,490
But if we can get to
one of his cars, hotwire...

749
00:51:00,615 --> 00:51:02,536
I've gotta find Bill.

750
00:51:02,661 --> 00:51:05,336
What? He was covered in blood.
He was gonna let them kill me.

751
00:51:05,461 --> 00:51:08,143
I ain't risking my life to save
his dead ass, and neither should you.

752
00:51:08,268 --> 00:51:10,525
He may not be dead,
and they forced him to do that.

753
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:12,819
That's not who he is.
I am not leaving without him.

754
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:15,029
Then you're a fucking idiot.

755
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,896
Just find us a way out of here.

756
00:51:23,493 --> 00:51:26,499
- Thanks for getting here so fast.
- What the hell's the goddamn emergency?

757
00:51:27,956 --> 00:51:29,049
Well, listen.

758
00:51:30,361 --> 00:51:33,691
I need to know
if there is any dogfighting

759
00:51:34,153 --> 00:51:35,258
in Renard Parish.

760
00:51:35,518 --> 00:51:37,176
Hell, no. We don't allow that.

761
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,386
What about nearby?

762
00:51:39,344 --> 00:51:42,473
I can't share official intra-parish
intelligence with civilians.

763
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:44,648
Lives are at stake.

764
00:51:44,773 --> 00:51:47,395
And speaking of, I already saved
your sorry ass once, so you owe me.

765
00:51:50,099 --> 00:51:51,799
I heard about some raids

766
00:51:52,289 --> 00:51:55,778
over in Union Parish recently,
down towards the north end of Bernice.

767
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,128
Thanks, buddy.

768
00:51:57,253 --> 00:51:59,198
Get the sheriff
anything he wants for breakfast,

769
00:51:59,582 --> 00:52:00,900
on the house.

770
00:52:30,388 --> 00:52:33,155
Where the hell'd you learn
to drive, Sam Merlotte?

771
00:53:04,845 --> 00:53:07,266
- Get out of the vehicle, please.
- What?

772
00:53:08,017 --> 00:53:10,317
Get out of the fucking vehicle, boy.

773
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:12,401
Don't make me say it again.

774
00:53:12,526 --> 00:53:15,316
- You can't...
- Ma'am, nobody's talking to you.

775
00:53:18,854 --> 00:53:21,054
I'm gonna give you one last chance

776
00:53:22,264 --> 00:53:25,243
to get out of the vehicle
before I start to get mad.

777
00:53:31,081 --> 00:53:33,376
What the fuck, dude?

778
00:53:36,487 --> 00:53:38,254
I'll tell you what the fuck!

779
00:53:39,506 --> 00:53:40,383
My God.

780
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:43,052
Ma'am, you wanna keep it quiet?

781
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,679
Careful, that's my throwing arm.

782
00:53:45,779 --> 00:53:48,014
You should have thought about that

783
00:53:48,378 --> 00:53:51,700
before you decided to engage
in lewd behavior in public,

784
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:55,022
which, in case you didn't know,
is against the law.

785
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:58,526
- You ain't no fucking cop, man.
- Not yet.

786
00:53:58,856 --> 00:54:01,153
But I'm gonna be one real soon.

787
00:54:01,867 --> 00:54:03,567
And I got my eye on you.

788
00:54:04,888 --> 00:54:06,742
I ain't doing nothing
you never did yourself.

789
00:54:07,824 --> 00:54:10,657
But here's the difference
between you and me.

790
00:54:15,473 --> 00:54:17,423
Something about you is wrong.

791
00:54:17,972 --> 00:54:19,714
And when I find out what that is,

792
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:21,650
I'm gonna fuck you up good, boy.

793
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:24,165
- You got it?
- I got it. Fuck.

794
00:54:25,957 --> 00:54:26,807
Good.

795
00:54:29,102 --> 00:54:31,052
Now get the fuck out of here.

796
00:54:31,594 --> 00:54:32,794
Fucking freak.

797
00:54:34,379 --> 00:54:35,829
You got that right.

798
00:54:44,638 --> 00:54:47,950
- This is fucking intense.
- This is how it's always gonna be.

799
00:54:51,547 --> 00:54:54,539
Oh, God.
You taste like fucking life itself.

800
00:54:54,887 --> 00:54:57,238
I would do anything for you.

801
00:54:58,481 --> 00:55:01,057
Will you take me to 4-Ever Young
and buy me anything I want?

802
00:55:01,182 --> 00:55:03,447
Better.
I'll steal it for you.

803
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,219
I love you, you fucking lunatic.

804
00:55:07,609 --> 00:55:09,908
Not more than I love you,
you hot bitch.

805
00:55:10,751 --> 00:55:14,568
Hotter than hell. Hottest bitch in town,
and I fucking own you.

806
00:55:16,755 --> 00:55:17,605
Trash.

807
00:55:31,704 --> 00:55:32,554
Fuck.

808
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,166
Don't be afraid.

809
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,627
I'm not one of them, I swear.
I'm a good guy.

810
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:42,213
- What do you want?
- I'm looking for Sookie Stackhouse.

811
00:55:42,394 --> 00:55:43,381
You got a car?

812
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:02,542
Please.

813
00:56:03,152 --> 00:56:04,352
Say something.

814
00:56:07,915 --> 00:56:09,323
Please, don't be dead.

815
00:56:10,101 --> 00:56:12,651
Not after everything
we've been through.

816
00:56:13,547 --> 00:56:15,619
I won't let you go, I won't.

817
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:24,700
I'm gonna get you out of here.

818
00:56:24,825 --> 00:56:27,133
I'm gonna make you well
if it's the last thing I ever do.

819
00:56:28,173 --> 00:56:31,345
Because I love you,
and I am not about to let you go.

820
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,506
Isn't that heartwarming?

821
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,712
This is all your fault.
