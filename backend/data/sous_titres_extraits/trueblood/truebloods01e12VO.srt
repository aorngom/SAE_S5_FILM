1
00:00:01,276 --> 00:00:04,085
You know that old leather jacket
I wear sometime?

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,360
The brown one?

3
00:00:06,768 --> 00:00:08,918
Well, make sure it goes to Hoyt.

4
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:11,539
I told him it was lucky.

5
00:00:12,573 --> 00:00:13,573
It ain't.

6
00:00:14,945 --> 00:00:16,595
But he don't know that.

7
00:00:19,748 --> 00:00:21,821
Sookie'll get the house.

8
00:00:23,055 --> 00:00:24,305
My bank account.

9
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:29,037
But I want you to have my truck.

10
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:31,991
Really?

11
00:00:32,548 --> 00:00:34,281
You've been a good friend, Rene.

12
00:00:35,098 --> 00:00:36,148
Thanks, man.

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,996
I'm giving it back though,
soon as they let you go.

14
00:00:40,279 --> 00:00:42,629
They ain't never
letting me go, Rene.

15
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:46,485
There's something
inside me that's just...

16
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:51,257
- It's wrong.
- Nah, come on now.

17
00:00:51,536 --> 00:00:53,632
It ain't like you went
and killed a bunch a...

18
00:00:53,757 --> 00:00:55,127
innocent women.

19
00:00:56,814 --> 00:00:59,364
- What?
- They were fangbangers.

20
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:01,743
If you hadn't have done it,
it was a matter of time.

21
00:01:01,868 --> 00:01:04,355
Wait, are you calling
my grandma a fangbanger?

22
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,953
Don't get your back all up, you...

23
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,523
I'm just sayin', you must've
had your reasons, that's all.

24
00:01:10,977 --> 00:01:12,904
There ain't no good reason
for what I did.

25
00:01:14,537 --> 00:01:16,533
- Suppose you're right.
- You can't go in there.

26
00:01:17,622 --> 00:01:18,687
He's my brother.

27
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,578
He's only allowed
one visitor at a time.

28
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,923
You can either let me by
or throw me in there,

29
00:01:23,048 --> 00:01:24,692
but I'm gonna see my brother.

30
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:31,323
- I'm sorry, Sookie. I'm so sorry.
- You've have nothing to be sorry for.

31
00:01:31,448 --> 00:01:34,468
I wish I got here sooner, before you
went and confessed to something.

32
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,741
I don't even remember
doing any of it.

33
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,339
I just know I did.

34
00:01:40,464 --> 00:01:42,585
Jason, you need to shut up, okay?

35
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:46,260
'Cause I'm real close to finding out
who the real killer is.

39
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,406
His name's Drew Marshall.
He had a sister named Cindy,

40
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,022
and I think he killed her.

41
00:03:22,147 --> 00:03:25,329
Strangled her just like
Maudette and Dawn and Amy.

42
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,959
<i>{\If she knows this }How come she hasn't gone
to the cops and gotten Jason out.</i>

43
00:03:31,207 --> 00:03:34,027
'Cause I tried that, and so far
the cops have done diddlysquat

44
00:03:34,152 --> 00:03:35,823
to protect me and my family.

45
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:39,467
I don't have any evidence yet.
I ignore what Drew Marshall looks like.

46
00:03:39,932 --> 00:03:42,136
So you can't really
be sure he's the killer.

47
00:03:43,111 --> 00:03:44,883
I've seen what's inside his head.

48
00:03:45,008 --> 00:03:47,358
<i>They'll never believe that about him,
but it's the truth.</i>

49
00:03:47,483 --> 00:03:49,862
<i>There's all kinds of strangeness
in this world.</i>

50
00:03:49,987 --> 00:03:52,059
I know you wanna help me,

51
00:03:52,922 --> 00:03:55,972
but that's only 'cause
you can't accept the truth.

52
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,592
I'm a murderer.

53
00:03:57,717 --> 00:04:00,339
And I'm going to hell.
Plain and simple.

54
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,022
You aren't hearing me.
I know who the killer is.

55
00:04:03,147 --> 00:04:04,906
And all we gotta do is find him.

56
00:04:06,515 --> 00:04:08,454
Listen to me, don't be stupid.

57
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,797
- What's your problem?
- Make her go away.

58
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:14,697
Am I your fucking butler?

59
00:04:15,142 --> 00:04:17,019
Please, just get her out of here.

60
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,619
Now, you heard him.

61
00:04:19,744 --> 00:04:20,894
Zoo's closed.

62
00:04:21,493 --> 00:04:23,862
Did you get the fax
from the Bunkie police department

63
00:04:23,987 --> 00:04:26,857
about Drew Marshall, the man
who's probably the real killer?

64
00:04:26,982 --> 00:04:30,138
Never heard of no fax
from no Bunkie P.D., or Drew-whoever.

65
00:04:30,263 --> 00:04:31,912
But I'll tell you one thing.

66
00:04:32,037 --> 00:04:33,982
The real killer is right there,
where he belongs.

67
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,400
You are one hell of a sorry excuse
for a cop and a human being,

68
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:40,654
Andy, and it's just a matter of time
before everyone knows it.

69
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,789
Hi, I'm Tara.

70
00:05:54,882 --> 00:05:57,063
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

71
00:05:58,398 --> 00:06:00,448
I thought you might be hungry.

72
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:02,109
Okay, this isn't food.

73
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,838
This is sculpture.

74
00:06:04,658 --> 00:06:06,114
And this place...

75
00:06:07,383 --> 00:06:09,568
You're not really just a social worker,
are you?

76
00:06:10,008 --> 00:06:11,689
I'm a lot of things.

77
00:06:11,814 --> 00:06:13,964
- Just like you. Coffee?
- Sure.

78
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,741
I mean, you're not just
a drunk-driving bartender, are you?

79
00:06:19,866 --> 00:06:21,879
You're also intelligent,
resourceful.

80
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,300
Strong.

81
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:25,231
A survivor.

82
00:06:25,356 --> 00:06:28,306
I don't feel like
any of those things right now.

83
00:06:28,998 --> 00:06:30,764
I didn't just wreck my car,

84
00:06:31,348 --> 00:06:32,998
I totaled my whole life.

85
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,530
All of it.

86
00:06:34,655 --> 00:06:37,937
Well, I suppose
that's one way of looking at it.

87
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:41,135
Personally, I see your situation
as an opportunity.

88
00:06:43,043 --> 00:06:45,616
I just got a fake exorcism
and a DUI.

89
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:48,362
I probably lost my job.

90
00:06:48,693 --> 00:06:50,043
All of my friends.

91
00:06:51,563 --> 00:06:53,313
And my mother disowned me.

92
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:56,305
I'm sorry, but I don't get
how that's an opportunity.

93
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:00,126
Maybe life has just cleared out
all the things that weren't working.

94
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:02,793
Now you've got room to rebuild.

95
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:05,506
Decide exactly what you want
your life to look like.

96
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:07,049
And make that happen.

97
00:07:10,534 --> 00:07:12,184
What do you want, Tara?

98
00:07:12,904 --> 00:07:14,473
What do you want your life to be?

99
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:18,487
I don't know.

100
00:07:19,736 --> 00:07:22,534
I guess I never really
let myself want anything.

101
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:27,272
That breaks my heart.

102
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,908
Yeah, well, there are people
a lot worse off than me. I'm sure.

103
00:07:32,196 --> 00:07:34,411
I should probably let you get
back to helping them.

104
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,747
Instead of watching me cry
all over your nice breakfast.

105
00:07:38,298 --> 00:07:40,584
I appreciate everything
you've done for me.

106
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,043
And I promise to pay back the bail
as soon as I can.

107
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:44,295
Tara, sit down.

108
00:07:44,728 --> 00:07:47,726
You haven't touched your food,
your dress isn't dry,

109
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,301
and I think we both know
you've got nowhere to go.

110
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,056
Please.

111
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,060
I know it's hard
for you to trust me,

112
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,442
but I really do just wanna help.

113
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:07,019
Even if that means giving you a place
to stay until you figure things out.

114
00:08:07,144 --> 00:08:09,931
- Why would you do that?
- 'Cause it's what I do.

115
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:13,931
It's what I want my life to be:
helping people.

116
00:08:14,056 --> 00:08:15,534
Not because I feel sorry for you,

117
00:08:15,931 --> 00:08:17,995
and not because I want
anything back from you.

118
00:08:18,362 --> 00:08:21,229
- Then why?
- Because you deserve a chance.

119
00:08:22,595 --> 00:08:24,850
And I'm in a position
to give you one.

120
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:46,507
You wanna end this thing, that's fine.
The least you could do is call me back

121
00:08:46,632 --> 00:08:50,082
and tell me where the fuck
you are so I can stop worrying.

122
00:08:50,686 --> 00:08:53,092
Thanks a lot,
I'll talk to you later, bye.

123
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:58,119
- What are you doing here?
- I got the lunch shift.

124
00:08:59,093 --> 00:09:02,206
With everything going on with Jason,
I figured you'd take the day off.

125
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,518
I'm not staying home and hiding,
having people think I'm ashamed.

126
00:09:05,643 --> 00:09:09,317
Besides, I'm gonna need all the money
I can get to hire a p.i.

127
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,512
Drew Marshall
is somewhere in this town.

128
00:09:11,637 --> 00:09:14,194
Who knows how many times
he's sat in one of those booths,

129
00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:17,469
looked me in right in the eye
and ordered a burger and fries.

130
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:20,891
- Yeah, but wouldn't you have heard him?
- Wouldn't you've smelled him?

131
00:09:21,016 --> 00:09:24,801
I ain't a shortwave radio. I spend
most of my time trying not to listen.

132
00:09:24,926 --> 00:09:26,945
- Sorry, I didn't mean...
- It's okay.

133
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:30,379
I better start my prep.

134
00:09:31,925 --> 00:09:33,973
You can only have
five minutes with him.

135
00:09:34,098 --> 00:09:35,248
Five minutes.

136
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,659
Mr. Stackhouse?

137
00:09:39,485 --> 00:09:41,246
My name is Orry Dawson.

138
00:09:42,111 --> 00:09:43,623
I told 'em I don't need no lawyer.

139
00:09:48,076 --> 00:09:49,335
I'm not a lawyer.

140
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,006
I'm here on behalf
of the Fellowship of the Sun.

141
00:09:54,065 --> 00:09:55,754
That anti-vampire church?

142
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:57,511
We are a religious organization

143
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,557
dedicated to the preservation
and salvation of the human race.

144
00:10:02,183 --> 00:10:03,180
Good.

145
00:10:03,431 --> 00:10:05,772
'Cause I thought
you just hated vampires.

146
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:07,791
And I used to,

147
00:10:08,592 --> 00:10:11,719
but then I got to know one,
and he was a pretty decent guy.

148
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,069
Until I got him killed.

149
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:18,208
See, that's where you're wrong.

150
00:10:18,843 --> 00:10:19,993
What you did,

151
00:10:20,525 --> 00:10:24,517
it was a service
to your race and to Jesus.

152
00:10:24,642 --> 00:10:26,290
And you should be proud of that.

153
00:10:27,973 --> 00:10:31,895
Last year there were over 800 reported
vampire-related attacks

154
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,298
in Louisiana alone.

155
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,211
And the law
won't do nothing about it.

156
00:10:36,643 --> 00:10:38,763
They are too busy
respecting those fiends

157
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,073
and their... Their civil rights.

158
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:43,145
What about our rights?

159
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,735
Our rights to be safe
in our own neighborhoods,

160
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,854
our right to our own blood?

161
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,105
No, I don't know nothing about that.

162
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:53,411
Look, uh...

163
00:10:54,475 --> 00:10:55,720
Officially,

164
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,193
the church can't condone
what you did.

165
00:10:59,318 --> 00:11:01,757
You took the lives of four women.

166
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,846
Women who had tainted
themselves and their race,

167
00:11:05,671 --> 00:11:07,628
but still, human women.

168
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,840
But we do recognize

169
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,110
that even though your methods
may have been flawed,

170
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,455
your intentions were pure.

171
00:11:27,984 --> 00:11:30,020
I got no idea
what you're talkin' about.

172
00:11:30,381 --> 00:11:31,531
That's smart.

173
00:11:32,503 --> 00:11:34,073
Don't admit to anything.

174
00:11:38,373 --> 00:11:41,668
The church has started up
a fund for your defense.

175
00:11:46,574 --> 00:11:47,982
In the meantime,

176
00:11:49,454 --> 00:11:52,251
here's something
to help you pass the time.

177
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:57,838
You are a brave soldier,
Jason Stackhouse.

178
00:11:59,024 --> 00:12:02,390
God loves you.
You... You will be saved.

179
00:13:25,636 --> 00:13:27,132
I didn't mean to interrupt.

180
00:13:27,257 --> 00:13:29,007
I was looking for Maryann.

181
00:13:30,002 --> 00:13:31,552
She'll be right back.

182
00:13:32,126 --> 00:13:33,476
You must be Tara.

183
00:13:34,044 --> 00:13:35,122
Come on in.

184
00:13:39,104 --> 00:13:40,233
I'm Eggs.

185
00:13:40,965 --> 00:13:41,806
Eggs?

186
00:13:42,109 --> 00:13:43,612
It's actually Benedict.

187
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,206
- Benedict Talley, so...
- Eggs Benedict.

188
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,360
Ah, shit, I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have laughed.

189
00:13:51,906 --> 00:13:54,707
- My name's screwed up too.
- Tara's a pretty name.

190
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,275
Suits you.

191
00:13:59,054 --> 00:14:02,414
Maryann did... Didn't
tell me she... She had a...

192
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:03,966
A boyfriend.

193
00:14:04,388 --> 00:14:05,263
I'm...

194
00:14:05,507 --> 00:14:07,761
I'm just stayin' here
till I get back on my feet.

195
00:14:07,943 --> 00:14:09,093
Just like you.

196
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:13,892
So collecting stray black people,
that some kind of hobby of hers?

197
00:14:15,056 --> 00:14:16,938
She was right about you.
You are funny.

198
00:14:18,427 --> 00:14:20,838
- What else she tell you about me?
- She said...

199
00:14:21,107 --> 00:14:24,402
You crashed your car with
a gallon of whiskey in your lap.

200
00:14:27,164 --> 00:14:28,314
It was vodka.

201
00:14:29,284 --> 00:14:30,634
Really cheap vodka.

202
00:14:32,668 --> 00:14:34,747
I'm... I'm not judging you.

203
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:36,427
Believe me, all right.

204
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:39,582
When Maryann found me I was...

205
00:14:41,763 --> 00:14:45,113
Let's just say, I was
a hell of a lot worse off than you.

206
00:14:47,192 --> 00:14:49,547
She's a miracle worker.
You'll see.

207
00:14:50,026 --> 00:14:52,597
Yeah, well, I won't be
sticking around that long.

208
00:14:53,175 --> 00:14:54,433
That's too bad.

209
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:02,681
My mama,

210
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:06,597
when she thought something
was too good to be true, she'd...

211
00:15:07,212 --> 00:15:09,150
She'd say, "Satan in a Sunday hat".

212
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,272
That's exactly what this is.

213
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:18,291
You know, it took me a long time
to stop looking over my shoulder too.

214
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:21,355
But there are
good people in this world.

215
00:15:22,137 --> 00:15:23,187
Sometimes...

216
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,813
good shit happens.

217
00:16:35,222 --> 00:16:38,318
He don't remember doin' it.
Like he had amnesia or something.

218
00:16:42,464 --> 00:16:44,200
Holler if y'all need anything, okay?

219
00:16:44,325 --> 00:16:47,129
Now, he's just sitting there,
lookin' like a dog that lost his bone.

220
00:16:48,987 --> 00:16:51,863
And then he says, "I did it.

221
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,970
"I killed those women.

222
00:16:54,603 --> 00:16:56,931
- You were right all along."
- He didn't exactly say that.

223
00:16:58,659 --> 00:17:01,967
You should've seen the look in his eye.
Ice cold.

224
00:17:02,092 --> 00:17:03,812
Like he was talking about road kill.

225
00:17:04,588 --> 00:17:05,631
Excuse me.

226
00:17:06,835 --> 00:17:09,885
Well, thank God you got him,
Detective Bellefleur.

227
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,108
Can I buy you a beer?

228
00:17:12,936 --> 00:17:14,651
Show my appreciation?

229
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,020
That's all right, Rosie,
I was just doin' my job.

230
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:22,248
<i>Whole family full
of freaks and killers.</i>

231
00:17:22,373 --> 00:17:25,000
<i>Oughta be ashamed to show her face
after what her brother did.</i>

232
00:17:25,292 --> 00:17:29,114
<i>Sleazy little manslut, Jason Stackhouse,
a goddamned murderer.</i>

233
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:31,919
<i>I'd pay good money
to watch that boy fry.</i>

234
00:17:32,044 --> 00:17:35,850
<i>He was so cute for a murderer,
wonder why he never hit on me.</i>

235
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,346
What's going on?

236
00:17:40,471 --> 00:17:42,492
You're right, I shouldn't
have come in today.

237
00:17:43,275 --> 00:17:45,087
Why don't you go
to my trailer, lie down?

238
00:17:45,212 --> 00:17:46,521
I need to get out of here.

239
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:50,020
- It's not safe.
- I'm just gonna drive around.

240
00:17:50,548 --> 00:17:53,409
I'll keep my doors locked.
I won't even get out of the car.

241
00:17:53,534 --> 00:17:55,081
I need some time alone.

242
00:17:55,677 --> 00:17:57,844
I gotta get these
thoughts out of my head.

243
00:17:57,969 --> 00:18:00,452
All right, all right, yeah.
I've got your tables.

244
00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:02,249
Thank you, Sam.

245
00:18:03,953 --> 00:18:05,220
For everything.

246
00:18:27,062 --> 00:18:29,828
Please, Jesus, don't do this to me.

247
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,716
Shoot, darn it!
Son of a mother!

248
00:18:38,841 --> 00:18:39,842
Fudge!

249
00:18:46,634 --> 00:18:47,957
Evything all right?

250
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:49,735
Just a...

251
00:18:50,598 --> 00:18:52,379
a little car trouble, that's all.

252
00:18:52,853 --> 00:18:54,503
Want me to take a look?

253
00:19:01,402 --> 00:19:04,313
Don't tell anybody,
but I don't know much about cars.

254
00:19:04,438 --> 00:19:05,244
Sorry.

255
00:19:05,617 --> 00:19:07,057
Thanks for trying.

256
00:19:07,581 --> 00:19:08,416
I...

257
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,521
I guess I should call a tow.

258
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:13,110
Why don't you let me
give you a ride home?

259
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,986
I'll get my buddy Hank at Auto Haven
to take a look on my way back.

260
00:19:17,981 --> 00:19:18,801
I

261
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,149
can't be alone.

262
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:27,899
Course you can't.

263
00:19:28,372 --> 00:19:31,043
How'bout I give you a ride home,
stay with you until Sam gets off work?

264
00:19:31,316 --> 00:19:32,788
I couldn't put you out.

265
00:19:35,097 --> 00:19:36,847
Your brother's been real good to me.

266
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,633
Least I could do.

267
00:19:38,841 --> 00:19:41,586
That's so kind of you, Rene.

268
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,079
I just wanna say...

269
00:19:47,204 --> 00:19:50,061
I told Andy, I've known killers,
and Jason ain't one.

270
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:54,320
- Thank you, Terry.
- Nobody ever listens to me.

271
00:19:55,315 --> 00:19:56,359
But they should.

272
00:20:06,215 --> 00:20:07,128
Ready?

273
00:20:27,838 --> 00:20:29,823
I can't believe Jason
gave you his truck.

274
00:20:29,948 --> 00:20:31,320
He loves this truck.

275
00:20:31,445 --> 00:20:32,595
I know, right?

276
00:20:33,255 --> 00:20:36,065
I tried talking him out of it.
He wasn't hearing it, though.

277
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,605
Buckle up, now.

278
00:20:42,365 --> 00:20:43,309
Thanks.

279
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:54,260
It's really true? You can hear
what I'm thinking right now?

280
00:20:54,385 --> 00:20:56,795
<i>What do I think about, think
about, think about nothing,</i>

281
00:20:56,963 --> 00:20:58,626
<i>nothing, think about nothing...</i>

282
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,397
Don't bother.
Thinking about nothing ain't possible.

283
00:21:01,522 --> 00:21:03,583
Trust me, everyone's
tried it around me.

284
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,845
Sooner or later
you'll think about something.

285
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,911
What's kinda funny, is that...
Your thoughts

286
00:21:10,321 --> 00:21:11,642
don't have an accent.

287
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:18,025
That must be hard on you,
livin' with that.

288
00:21:19,036 --> 00:21:20,244
It is hard.

289
00:21:20,802 --> 00:21:21,789
Sometimes.

290
00:21:23,587 --> 00:21:26,387
You have no idea how sick
and twisted some people are.

291
00:21:26,922 --> 00:21:29,010
Lord, I can believe that,
yes, ma'am.

292
00:21:29,135 --> 00:21:32,317
It's one thing when they
think horrible stuff about me,

293
00:21:32,442 --> 00:21:33,442
I mean,

294
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:35,904
I'm kinda used to it.
But,

295
00:21:36,575 --> 00:21:38,364
when it's about my brother...

296
00:21:44,362 --> 00:21:46,012
He's all I've got left.

297
00:21:47,418 --> 00:21:49,759
I mean, I've lost everyone.

298
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:01,801
Thanks.

299
00:22:06,014 --> 00:22:07,356
I've lost people too.

300
00:22:10,952 --> 00:22:13,107
It don't ever get any easier.
But,

301
00:22:13,887 --> 00:22:15,415
you find ways to cope.

302
00:22:38,898 --> 00:22:41,634
I thought I told you kids
to take out the garbage.

303
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,692
What the hell are you watching?

304
00:22:48,385 --> 00:22:49,730
Oh, my Lord.

305
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:51,409
Where'd you get this?

306
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:53,439
Coby?

307
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,119
Lisa, you answer me, right now.

308
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,792
It's Rene's.
We found it in the garage.

309
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:03,174
Go to your room.

310
00:23:24,761 --> 00:23:26,991
It's hotter in here
than hell on a Sunday.

311
00:23:27,345 --> 00:23:30,068
I know, Gran used to leave
the windows open all day,

312
00:23:30,193 --> 00:23:33,043
but I haven't felt safe
doin' that in a while.

313
00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:36,538
Have a seat, I'll fix us
some iced teas.

314
00:23:36,764 --> 00:23:37,856
Sounds good.

315
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:11,717
These fuckers' palates are
as backwoods as their brains.

316
00:24:15,895 --> 00:24:18,630
- Rene left his vest.
- I'll put it in the lost and found.

317
00:24:34,468 --> 00:24:36,406
Hey, where's Sookie?
Did you see her?

318
00:24:37,465 --> 00:24:39,776
- Where'd she go?
- She left with Rene

319
00:24:39,901 --> 00:24:41,749
about 20, 23 minutes ago.

320
00:24:45,285 --> 00:24:47,825
- Rene, you take it sweet?
- Yes, ma'am.

321
00:24:49,884 --> 00:24:51,319
You scared me.

322
00:24:51,816 --> 00:24:52,655
Did I?

323
00:24:55,061 --> 00:24:56,175
Sorry about that.

324
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:59,564
<i>Don't think about it...
Blood, blood, so much blood...</i>

325
00:24:59,689 --> 00:25:01,425
<i>She wasn't supposed to be here...
Shut up!</i>

326
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,833
<i>- Rene?
- Sookie ain't here?</i>

327
00:25:06,415 --> 00:25:08,046
You weren't supposed to be here.

328
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,487
You all right?

329
00:25:16,963 --> 00:25:17,801
I'm...

330
00:25:18,242 --> 00:25:20,385
so jumpy these days.

331
00:25:22,081 --> 00:25:23,353
Let me help you with that.

332
00:25:24,826 --> 00:25:26,601
I'm gonna go get a mop.

333
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:41,621
What do you think you're doin'?

334
00:25:42,132 --> 00:25:43,498
Stay away!

335
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:47,502
You're not gonna shoot me.

336
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,456
Told you.

337
00:25:53,281 --> 00:25:55,175
<i>She deserves it,
needs it, wants to die.</i>

338
00:25:55,465 --> 00:25:57,715
<i>That's why she fucks them fangers...</i>

339
00:26:01,642 --> 00:26:02,361
Fuck.

340
00:26:02,705 --> 00:26:03,705
Goddamn it.

341
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,093
Get back here, you fucking bitch!

342
00:26:18,805 --> 00:26:19,676
<i>Dang it.</i>

343
00:26:19,801 --> 00:26:22,251
<i>Nothing that'll cover up
what you done.</i>

344
00:26:22,983 --> 00:26:24,371
<i>You watching me now?</i>

345
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,291
<i>You freak.</i>

346
00:26:31,846 --> 00:26:35,340
<i>You're the freak, Cindy. You're
the damn freak. Fuckin' freak. Fuck!</i>

347
00:26:36,364 --> 00:26:39,011
<i>Spread your legs for a dead man.
Mama'd roll over in her grave...</i>

348
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:40,638
<i>Get the fuck out of here.</i>

349
00:26:46,312 --> 00:26:48,017
Sookie. I'll teach you, you bitch!

350
00:26:49,877 --> 00:26:51,899
<i>What're you doing?
Get away from me!</i>

351
00:26:58,532 --> 00:26:59,553
<i>Get out!</i>

352
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,914
I can feel you in my head!

353
00:27:06,832 --> 00:27:08,499
I thought you were Jason.

354
00:27:11,787 --> 00:27:13,213
Die, fang fucker!

355
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,600
Stay the fuck out of my head!

356
00:28:32,774 --> 00:28:34,737
Come on, Sookie. Let's be...

357
00:28:35,203 --> 00:28:37,208
Let's be friends.
I'm sorry.

358
00:28:37,893 --> 00:28:39,743
I didn't mean to scare you.

359
00:28:41,264 --> 00:28:42,580
We can be friends.

360
00:28:49,836 --> 00:28:52,631
Sookie. Seriously,
I was just kidding.

361
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:55,677
<i>Can you fuckin' hear me,
you filthy fucking cunt?</i>

362
00:28:55,802 --> 00:28:57,694
<i>I'm gonna tear out
your throat with my hands</i>

363
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,637
<i>and fuck your dead face.</i>

364
00:29:03,102 --> 00:29:05,478
<i>Shit. Goddamn it.</i>

365
00:29:05,603 --> 00:29:07,693
<i>I must have lost her.
Could be hiding in the woods.</i>

366
00:29:07,818 --> 00:29:09,327
<i>I better go back and check.</i>

367
00:29:23,572 --> 00:29:27,263
Mind-reading,
vampire-fucking, freak bitch!

368
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,647
You think you're so smart!

369
00:29:39,772 --> 00:29:40,795
You smart now?

370
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:04,800
What the fuck are you?

371
00:30:19,614 --> 00:30:21,844
You fuckin' freak fuck!

372
00:30:22,444 --> 00:30:23,653
Fuckin' sick fuck.

373
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:26,333
Die, you fucking freak of nature!

374
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:31,201
Die...

375
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:37,250
Fucking bitch!

376
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:32,796
I... am...

377
00:31:33,857 --> 00:31:34,807
sorry.

378
00:31:38,014 --> 00:31:39,580
No, Bill, please.

379
00:31:40,063 --> 00:31:41,852
We gotta get him out of the light.

380
00:32:22,927 --> 00:32:25,871
You look so pretty.

381
00:32:27,325 --> 00:32:30,696
Like someone turned
a light on under your skin.

382
00:32:32,323 --> 00:32:33,811
Hospital gave her pain meds.

383
00:32:33,936 --> 00:32:35,575
She's... She's a little loopy.

384
00:32:37,891 --> 00:32:40,306
Didn't you listen
when I said I'd lose my shit

385
00:32:40,431 --> 00:32:41,956
if anything ever happened to you?

386
00:32:42,864 --> 00:32:44,414
Don't lose your shit.

387
00:32:46,287 --> 00:32:47,421
I'm fine.

388
00:32:50,227 --> 00:32:52,677
Did Sam tell you

389
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,304
that he saved my life?

390
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:04,873
He turned into a dog and bit Rene.

391
00:33:07,378 --> 00:33:10,610
No shit. I'm gonna need some of them
drugs they gave you.

392
00:33:13,782 --> 00:33:15,813
You guys, we should let her rest.

393
00:33:17,918 --> 00:33:20,004
You need to let people see

394
00:33:20,719 --> 00:33:22,255
the real you.

395
00:33:22,684 --> 00:33:23,603
'Cause

396
00:33:25,085 --> 00:33:26,112
you're kind

397
00:33:26,895 --> 00:33:27,994
and brave.

398
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,540
There's nothing there not to love.

399
00:33:35,156 --> 00:33:36,506
Right back at you.

400
00:34:01,932 --> 00:34:03,625
All right then.
Thanks.

401
00:34:06,793 --> 00:34:08,084
DA's dropping the charges.

402
00:34:08,567 --> 00:34:11,472
No. No fucking way.
He confessed.

403
00:34:11,597 --> 00:34:15,113
The marks on Amy Burley's
neck match Rene's belt.

404
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:18,585
Or Drew Marshall.
Whatever the hell his name is.

405
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,909
He near about put Sookie
in a body bag.

406
00:34:21,034 --> 00:34:22,807
We got no reason to hold Stackhouse.

407
00:34:23,454 --> 00:34:24,804
That's horseshit!

408
00:34:25,575 --> 00:34:28,604
Get ahold of yourself. I don't need
you screwing things up even worse.

409
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:31,584
So, what?
We're just gonna let him go?

410
00:34:31,941 --> 00:34:32,941
Not "we."

411
00:34:33,562 --> 00:34:35,812
You brought him in.
You let him go.

412
00:34:36,816 --> 00:34:37,933
Right now, Andy.

413
00:34:53,634 --> 00:34:55,316
Is there some way
I can get a magazine?

414
00:34:55,441 --> 00:34:57,302
This shit's putting me to sleep.

415
00:34:59,834 --> 00:35:01,524
- What're you doin'?
- Get out of here.

416
00:35:01,649 --> 00:35:02,463
What?

417
00:35:02,588 --> 00:35:04,904
You heard me.
Get the fuck out of here.

418
00:35:08,161 --> 00:35:11,272
- Is this some kinda trick or something?
- No, you stupid shit.

419
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,998
It ain't a trick.

420
00:35:13,259 --> 00:35:14,773
It's a fucking miracle!

421
00:35:17,786 --> 00:35:18,822
<i>Oh, sweet Jesus,</i>

422
00:35:19,003 --> 00:35:20,239
please forgive me.

423
00:35:20,364 --> 00:35:22,618
I had no idea, Sookie, I swear.

424
00:35:23,233 --> 00:35:26,574
- Course you didn't.
- I brought him around my kids.

425
00:35:27,297 --> 00:35:29,599
I slept in the bed
with him every night.

426
00:35:29,724 --> 00:35:32,416
And all that time,
it was nothin' but lies.

427
00:35:33,219 --> 00:35:35,666
I mean, his name, his accent.

428
00:35:36,836 --> 00:35:38,886
God, you think you know someone.

429
00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:41,955
How could I not know?

430
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,330
None of us did.

431
00:35:44,324 --> 00:35:47,446
- Don't blame yourself, honey.
- I can't help it.

432
00:35:47,571 --> 00:35:50,021
I told you to stay
out of my thoughts.

433
00:35:51,017 --> 00:35:52,897
Is that why you didn't listen in
on Rene?

434
00:35:55,298 --> 00:35:56,554
It's like he kept

435
00:35:57,259 --> 00:35:58,832
that part of himself...

436
00:36:00,266 --> 00:36:01,897
locked away in some...

437
00:36:02,903 --> 00:36:03,772
dark...

438
00:36:04,425 --> 00:36:05,744
corner of his mind.

439
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:07,208
Oh, God.

440
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,710
I am so sorry.

441
00:36:17,163 --> 00:36:19,618
I want you to promise me
something, okay?

442
00:36:20,351 --> 00:36:21,351
Okay.

443
00:36:21,476 --> 00:36:23,939
Someday, if I ever find another man.

444
00:36:24,738 --> 00:36:27,975
I want you to look inside his head
and tell me everything that's in there.

445
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:32,565
Arlene,
it doesn't really work that way.

446
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,523
Just promise me, okay?

447
00:36:35,669 --> 00:36:38,164
'Cause I have
the worst taste in men.

448
00:36:44,749 --> 00:36:46,431
Is Bill gonna be okay?

449
00:36:52,798 --> 00:36:54,334
I don't think so.

450
00:37:00,971 --> 00:37:02,134
Oh, honey.

451
00:37:03,504 --> 00:37:04,854
Oh, sweet baby.

452
00:37:10,026 --> 00:37:12,033
I'm gonna head on over to the bar.

453
00:37:13,515 --> 00:37:17,064
Make sure Terry ain't P-T-S-Ding
all over my clam chowder.

454
00:37:18,122 --> 00:37:21,198
Thanks, Lafayette.
I appreciate you holding down the fort.

455
00:37:21,655 --> 00:37:24,956
No worries, boyfriend. 'Cause
I'm gonna hit your ass up for a raise,

456
00:37:25,081 --> 00:37:27,612
soon as they pull them stitches out
your forehead.

457
00:37:28,918 --> 00:37:30,174
Call me later, T.

458
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,915
Where have you been?

459
00:37:40,924 --> 00:37:42,518
I left you like 5 messages.

460
00:37:43,629 --> 00:37:45,285
I didn't get any messages.

461
00:37:46,078 --> 00:37:47,078
What?

462
00:37:48,151 --> 00:37:50,145
Look, we don't have
to talk about this now.

463
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,676
Sookie almost died.

464
00:37:52,461 --> 00:37:54,886
And she would've,
if you hadn't been there.

465
00:37:56,045 --> 00:37:57,564
I'm glad you were, okay?

466
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,192
I was...

467
00:38:01,575 --> 00:38:02,819
I was worried about you.

468
00:38:03,749 --> 00:38:04,959
I'm sure you were.

469
00:38:05,557 --> 00:38:07,200
You worry about everybody.

470
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:10,097
But Sookie's right,

471
00:38:10,485 --> 00:38:11,847
you're an amazing guy.

472
00:38:15,249 --> 00:38:17,268
You deserve to get
everything you want.

473
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,710
And so do I.

474
00:38:22,632 --> 00:38:23,904
What does that mean?

475
00:38:24,421 --> 00:38:25,941
Take good care of her.

476
00:38:26,275 --> 00:38:27,386
Wait, Tara...

477
00:38:30,255 --> 00:38:32,134
Maryann, this is my friend Sam.

478
00:38:32,662 --> 00:38:34,141
Sam, this is Maryann.

479
00:38:34,948 --> 00:38:37,062
Sam, it's so nice to meet you.

480
00:38:38,379 --> 00:38:39,518
You ready to go?

481
00:38:44,053 --> 00:38:46,028
What the hell are you doing here?

482
00:38:46,443 --> 00:38:48,674
Did you think
I wasn't gonna find you?

483
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,271
You silly, silly dog.

484
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:58,749
<i>I should've known.</i>

485
00:38:59,422 --> 00:39:01,809
'Cause there were things
he liked to do...

486
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,371
in bed

487
00:39:03,618 --> 00:39:05,548
that no normal man ever does.

488
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:15,447
I've never been happier
to see you in my life.

489
00:39:15,572 --> 00:39:17,502
That's nice, but, sweetie, I'm...

490
00:39:17,627 --> 00:39:20,171
black and blue all over
and you're squeezing me.

491
00:39:20,296 --> 00:39:21,106
Sorry.

492
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:24,678
Shit,

493
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,640
look what that son of a bitch
did to you.

494
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:30,072
I can't believe I gave him my truck.

495
00:39:32,118 --> 00:39:33,985
If he was still alive right now,
I'm...

496
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,624
fuckin' kill him again.

497
00:39:36,935 --> 00:39:37,873
Excuse me.

498
00:39:43,891 --> 00:39:46,327
- Me and my mouth.
- She'll be all right.

499
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,311
Eventually.

500
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:55,472
You know,
I was sitting in that jail,

501
00:39:55,853 --> 00:39:58,640
and I just kept thinkin' about
all the stupid stuff I'd done.

502
00:39:58,765 --> 00:40:00,145
That must've kept you busy.

503
00:40:01,047 --> 00:40:03,736
And I know it seems like all
I ever think about's myself.

504
00:40:04,065 --> 00:40:05,121
And drinking

505
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,626
and chasing women.

506
00:40:06,751 --> 00:40:09,299
But that's only 'cause I thought
that's all I was good at.

507
00:40:09,424 --> 00:40:10,640
That's not true.

508
00:40:12,525 --> 00:40:13,525
You were

509
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:15,270
good at football.

510
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,378
Not good enough for a scholarship.

511
00:40:18,885 --> 00:40:20,733
I ain't never been
good enough for anything.

512
00:40:20,858 --> 00:40:21,879
Or anybody.

513
00:40:23,191 --> 00:40:24,585
Well, except maybe Amy.

514
00:40:27,505 --> 00:40:29,019
But she's gone, so...

515
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,031
So I was in there,
waitin' to die too,

516
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:34,798
and I realized

517
00:40:35,948 --> 00:40:37,390
my life wasn't worth nothing.

518
00:40:38,089 --> 00:40:40,142
I'd never done nothing
worth being proud of.

519
00:40:41,324 --> 00:40:43,312
And all I could think
to do was to end it.

520
00:40:43,437 --> 00:40:45,064
- Jason...
- No, it's okay.

521
00:40:45,241 --> 00:40:46,244
'Cause then,

522
00:40:47,171 --> 00:40:48,439
something happened.

523
00:40:52,131 --> 00:40:53,311
I was saved.

524
00:40:54,217 --> 00:40:55,908
I was given a second chance.

525
00:40:56,242 --> 00:40:59,093
And now I know that all this...
this bad stuff that happened,

526
00:40:59,218 --> 00:41:00,968
it happened for a reason.

527
00:41:01,302 --> 00:41:02,371
What's that?

528
00:41:04,104 --> 00:41:05,272
I ain't sure yet.

529
00:41:05,397 --> 00:41:07,754
But I do know that I'm meant
to do something important

530
00:41:07,922 --> 00:41:10,445
with my life.
And soon as I find out what that is,

531
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:13,545
- I ain't gonna fuck it up.
- That's good.

532
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:15,106
- I guess.
- Yeah.

533
00:41:23,469 --> 00:41:24,556
I love you, Sook.

534
00:41:25,031 --> 00:41:25,840
And...

535
00:41:26,311 --> 00:41:28,274
I'm gonna take good care
of you from now on.

536
00:41:28,749 --> 00:41:29,759
I promise.

537
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,802
How about you just take care
of yourself and...

538
00:41:33,928 --> 00:41:35,118
stay out of trouble?

539
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,838
Come on, you don't have
to worry about me no more.

540
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,002
I'm good.

541
00:41:47,283 --> 00:41:50,453
Why is all fucking garbage
on the side of the garbage can?

542
00:41:51,606 --> 00:41:53,097
Nasty motherfuckers.

543
00:41:53,525 --> 00:41:55,967
Got no... Goddamn home training.

544
00:42:03,152 --> 00:42:04,725
Oh, my God!

545
00:42:05,146 --> 00:42:07,041
<i>Daddy. Oh, Daddy.</i>

546
00:42:07,166 --> 00:42:09,298
<i>It is you. I found you.</i>

547
00:42:09,423 --> 00:42:12,443
<i>I found you. They said you were dead.
But I knew you weren't.</i>

548
00:42:14,767 --> 00:42:15,767
<i>Daddy.</i>

549
00:42:16,198 --> 00:42:17,525
<i>Hold me close...</i>

550
00:42:31,487 --> 00:42:32,821
You're alive?

551
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,612
Technically, no.

552
00:42:36,459 --> 00:42:37,680
But I am healed.

553
00:42:42,901 --> 00:42:43,901
I fed.

554
00:42:46,358 --> 00:42:48,013
Would you like to come in?

555
00:43:18,351 --> 00:43:20,931
Without my blood
it'll take weeks for you to heal.

556
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:22,237
I don't care.

557
00:43:23,288 --> 00:43:24,579
After everything,

558
00:43:25,086 --> 00:43:27,739
I... just need
to feel human right now.

559
00:43:31,068 --> 00:43:32,357
I failed you.

560
00:43:33,185 --> 00:43:36,273
You were willing to sacrifice
yourself to save me.

561
00:43:37,113 --> 00:43:38,441
If I'd just been...

562
00:43:39,297 --> 00:43:41,423
My life is too short for all that.

563
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,886
{\TWO WEEKS LATER}

564
00:44:13,011 --> 00:44:15,928
<i>Yesterday, the Vermont Supreme Court
ruled that limiting marriage</i>

565
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:19,362
<i> between only human men and women
is unconstitutional,</i>

566
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:22,407
<i>effectively legalizing
vampire marriage in the state.</i>

567
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:25,737
<i>Courthouses will be staying open after
dark to accommodate hundreds of couples</i>

568
00:44:25,862 --> 00:44:27,173
<i>from all over America.</i>

569
00:44:27,298 --> 00:44:29,746
Oh, my God,
you know what this means?

570
00:44:29,871 --> 00:44:33,598
- Now you and Bill can get married.
- Stop it, Arlene.

571
00:44:34,197 --> 00:44:35,817
This isn't Vermont.

572
00:44:36,873 --> 00:44:39,281
Besides,
he hasn't even asked me yet.

573
00:44:40,195 --> 00:44:42,385
And I don't know
what I'd say if he did.

574
00:44:42,853 --> 00:44:44,391
You should marry Bill.

575
00:44:45,471 --> 00:44:47,354
Hell, I'll even throw you a party.

576
00:44:47,479 --> 00:44:50,162
Won't even break the bank, is all you
need is a couple kegs of Tru Blood,

577
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:52,347
seein' as
how they don't eat or drink.

578
00:44:52,472 --> 00:44:56,136
Bet there's even a vampire band
and vampire wedding decorations.

579
00:44:56,738 --> 00:44:58,476
Put Arlene's party to shame.

580
00:45:02,975 --> 00:45:05,452
You know you're about
as subtle as a flying brick?

581
00:45:07,445 --> 00:45:10,465
Maryann says if you want something,
you don't wait for it to come to you.

582
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:12,205
- You demand it...
- Do me a favor,

583
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:13,665
don't quote Maryann to me.

584
00:45:14,595 --> 00:45:16,509
Excuse me for giving a damn.

585
00:45:18,897 --> 00:45:21,210
You heard from your cousin,
by any chance?

586
00:45:22,027 --> 00:45:24,200
'Cause I'm about
to give away his job.

587
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:27,368
But this one time Lafayette
went to Marthaville for the night.

588
00:45:27,493 --> 00:45:30,462
He ended up go-go dancing
in Palm Beach for like 8 months.

589
00:45:30,755 --> 00:45:31,766
Fantastic.

590
00:45:41,946 --> 00:45:42,830
People

591
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:46,031
disappear all the time,
but they're never really gone.

592
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:48,948
The good parts of 'em
always stay put.

593
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:54,403
I hope you're right about that,

594
00:45:54,528 --> 00:45:55,350
Terry.

595
00:45:57,266 --> 00:45:59,754
Your hair's like a sunset
after a bomb went off.

596
00:46:01,751 --> 00:46:02,751
Pretty.

597
00:46:09,094 --> 00:46:10,640
<i>And God said,</i>

598
00:46:10,765 --> 00:46:12,475
<i>"Let there be light."</i>

599
00:46:12,844 --> 00:46:14,555
And there was light.

600
00:46:15,526 --> 00:46:17,938
And even though we stand
in darkness today,

601
00:46:18,345 --> 00:46:19,748
we shall not fear.

602
00:46:20,803 --> 00:46:22,815
For God has given us

603
00:46:23,144 --> 00:46:24,518
the ultimate weapon.

604
00:46:25,353 --> 00:46:26,614
The ultimate

605
00:46:27,492 --> 00:46:28,866
salvation!

606
00:46:29,547 --> 00:46:30,630
The sun.

607
00:46:31,904 --> 00:46:34,746
And he has placed in front of us

608
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:38,438
a daunting but righteous task.

609
00:46:40,307 --> 00:46:41,869
We will not falter.

610
00:46:43,356 --> 00:46:44,718
We will not rest.

611
00:46:45,727 --> 00:46:50,215
Until we have brought
God's holy light down on each

612
00:46:50,457 --> 00:46:53,135
and every bloodsucking abomination!

613
00:46:58,781 --> 00:47:00,438
- Amen.
- Praise Jesus!

614
00:47:10,103 --> 00:47:11,728
Time to pack it up, Andy.

615
00:47:11,853 --> 00:47:14,587
My family used to own
this whole damn town.

616
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:17,330
The land this rat hole
stands on included.

617
00:47:17,499 --> 00:47:19,247
You don't own this rat hole no more,

618
00:47:19,372 --> 00:47:21,502
- so I'm cuttin' you off.
- Join the club.

619
00:47:21,997 --> 00:47:24,773
One minute you're a hero,
the next you can't get a fuckin' drink.

620
00:47:24,898 --> 00:47:28,796
I ain't never seen a bird fly so high
it don't have to come down sometime.

621
00:47:42,033 --> 00:47:44,311
- What's that for?
- It's your pity party.

622
00:47:44,604 --> 00:47:46,984
Only one you're getting from me,
so suck it up.

623
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:50,947
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me.

624
00:47:51,117 --> 00:47:53,188
It's just easier
for me not to hate you.

625
00:47:53,432 --> 00:47:55,453
Hating takes a lot of energy.
And I'm saving mine up

626
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:57,547
for all the good shit
that's coming my way.

627
00:47:57,672 --> 00:48:00,641
'Cause I am a good person,
and I deserve good shit in my life.

628
00:48:00,766 --> 00:48:02,875
Yeah, put it on a bumper sticker.

629
00:48:11,387 --> 00:48:14,388
Thank you, Sookie.
Where's Vampire Bill at tonight?

630
00:48:14,556 --> 00:48:16,973
Is he out celebrating?
Some sort of vampire party?

631
00:48:18,116 --> 00:48:21,520
Actually,
we're celebrating together later.

632
00:48:24,277 --> 00:48:26,497
Just tell him
congratulations from me.

633
00:48:27,147 --> 00:48:30,368
I don't care what nobody says,
if I met a nice vampire girl,

634
00:48:30,493 --> 00:48:33,636
- I'd be proud to have her on my arm.
- I'd love to see your mama's face

635
00:48:33,761 --> 00:48:36,359
- if you brought her home for dinner.
- Yeah, me too.

636
00:48:36,794 --> 00:48:39,720
You know, yeah. I mean,
does Bill know anybody my age?

637
00:48:42,143 --> 00:48:43,166
Seriously.

638
00:48:54,509 --> 00:48:55,554
Hi, Daddy.

639
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:00,910
What is this?

640
00:49:01,262 --> 00:49:03,392
There are favors and there are...

641
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:04,605
favors.

642
00:49:05,201 --> 00:49:07,023
She is extremely annoying.

643
00:49:09,319 --> 00:49:10,986
You can't do this. We had a deal.

644
00:49:11,154 --> 00:49:13,598
Now the terms have changed.
She's yours.

645
00:49:14,376 --> 00:49:16,308
Unless you wanna give me Sookie?

646
00:49:22,039 --> 00:49:23,414
It's just a suggestion.

647
00:49:24,427 --> 00:49:27,294
Though a few nights with this one
may change your mind.

648
00:49:30,165 --> 00:49:31,170
Good luck.

649
00:49:42,044 --> 00:49:43,864
Who's good to eat around here?

650
00:49:53,909 --> 00:49:55,506
He ain't listening to me.

651
00:49:55,765 --> 00:49:56,774
Good luck.

652
00:49:59,866 --> 00:50:02,131
We're closing.
Give me your keys.

653
00:50:02,505 --> 00:50:04,865
I ain't giving you shit, Stackhouse.

654
00:50:05,298 --> 00:50:08,419
<i>I'm a failure. A pathetic fuckin' loser.
And everybody knows it.</i>

655
00:50:08,587 --> 00:50:12,096
<i>Just like she said they would.
She's real happy with herself.</i>

656
00:50:12,221 --> 00:50:15,016
It don't ever make me happy
to see someone in pain.

657
00:50:16,676 --> 00:50:19,272
I'm gonna call your sister
to come pick you up.

658
00:50:20,576 --> 00:50:21,806
Detective Bellefleur.

659
00:50:57,882 --> 00:51:00,296
- Where's my car?
- Andy Bellefleur, the only thing

660
00:51:00,421 --> 00:51:02,015
you're driving tonight is us crazy.

661
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:04,789
Portia{\ said she's} is on her way to pick you up.
Give me your keys.

662
00:51:04,914 --> 00:51:07,198
I don't have 'em.
Left 'em in the car.

663
00:51:07,657 --> 00:51:09,688
Right here, underneath this light.

664
00:51:10,344 --> 00:51:14,276
- Some son of a bitch stole my car.
- You sure this is where you parked it?

665
00:51:14,708 --> 00:51:16,758
This whole town's gone to shit.

666
00:51:17,704 --> 00:51:19,962
Nobody used to go
murdering each other,

667
00:51:20,361 --> 00:51:21,450
stealin' cars.

668
00:51:21,771 --> 00:51:24,953
That's what happens when
you don't let a good cop do his job.

669
00:51:25,613 --> 00:51:27,221
Ain't that it over there?

670
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:32,115
That ain't where I parked it.

671
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:35,714
What the hell?

672
00:51:45,131 --> 00:51:46,963
That ain't mine, I swear.

673
00:51:47,936 --> 00:51:52,997
La team AB+ vous retrouve
l'année prochaine
