1
00:00:06,148 --> 00:00:08,778
Sookie, are you okay?
You want some water?

2
00:00:09,987 --> 00:00:10,987
Four?

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,585
You're sure you found 4 bodies?

4
00:00:13,705 --> 00:00:17,247
- We shouldn't even be telling you this.
- Not now. Not with me.

5
00:00:18,766 --> 00:00:21,015
There's 4 sets of remains
inside four coffins.

6
00:00:21,135 --> 00:00:23,619
Oh, my God.
We can't let you go in there.

7
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:25,658
If you don't take
your hands off me right now,

8
00:00:25,778 --> 00:00:27,322
I swear to God, I will kill you.

9
00:00:27,682 --> 00:00:29,594
Sweetheart,
you don't wanna come up here.

10
00:00:29,714 --> 00:00:31,264
Jiminy Christmas.

11
00:00:32,503 --> 00:00:34,829
- That's what happens to vampires?
- Evidently.

12
00:00:35,765 --> 00:00:37,314
Plus, we got three more.

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,865
I hope you skipped breakfast.

14
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,182
Did Bud send you up here
to make an ID? 'Cause...

15
00:00:46,872 --> 00:00:48,093
Sookie, you okay?

<i>- Bill Compton.

20
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:29,221
<i>press one or just wait... </i>

21
00:02:52,642 --> 00:02:53,651
Shit!

22
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:00,931
Mama, it's not even 8.

23
00:03:01,051 --> 00:03:03,161
Good morning, baby.
Did I wake you?

24
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:05,059
I'm almost done.
Just a couple more loads.

25
00:03:05,179 --> 00:03:07,482
- These are half full.
- Useless to me.

26
00:03:07,642 --> 00:03:09,025
Just fuel for demon fire.

27
00:03:09,842 --> 00:03:12,155
The bottle kept him alive
for 40 years.

28
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:15,783
As long as I keep the stuff out
of my house, he ain't never coming back.

29
00:03:16,612 --> 00:03:19,286
- Let's see how long you can keep it up.
- Forever.

30
00:03:19,406 --> 00:03:21,663
Gotta be.
I'm down to my last chance.

31
00:03:22,131 --> 00:03:25,860
- You didn't have a drink today?
- Didn't need one. Didn't even want one.

32
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:31,673
- Is that maple syrup?
- Check the kitchen. I made hoecakes.

33
00:03:38,768 --> 00:03:39,991
Are you serious?

34
00:03:40,214 --> 00:03:43,636
- I haven't had hoecakes since...
- Since your grandmama was alive.

35
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:46,208
I always could make 'em,
just never did.

36
00:03:46,328 --> 00:03:47,836
The demon never let me.

37
00:03:58,526 --> 00:04:01,077
- You made these with bacon grease.
- It's the only way.

38
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:05,224
You eat, baby girl.

39
00:04:05,575 --> 00:04:08,005
I got me some more devil juice
to take out.

40
00:04:19,114 --> 00:04:20,652
Goddamn.

41
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:23,391
You...

42
00:04:24,937 --> 00:04:27,496
You are not like anybody I ever met.

43
00:04:28,598 --> 00:04:30,667
I was just gonna say the same thing.

44
00:04:32,244 --> 00:04:33,641
Jesus.

45
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,885
It felt like the whole world
came together.

46
00:04:37,548 --> 00:04:38,589
Me, you,

47
00:04:38,882 --> 00:04:40,349
the bed, the house.

48
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,639
- We were all one big giant...
- Organism.

49
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,151
Yeah, mine was huge.

50
00:04:48,556 --> 00:04:51,785
I never knew vamp blood could do
something like this to you.

51
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:53,912
You know what?

52
00:04:54,724 --> 00:04:56,450
Neither did I. I mean...

53
00:04:56,952 --> 00:04:59,852
I've had V partners before,
but this was...

54
00:05:01,155 --> 00:05:03,473
on a totally different planet.

55
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:06,225
You're an extraordinary being.

56
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:11,105
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I mean, in some ways, we barely

57
00:05:11,265 --> 00:05:13,407
know each other, right?
But you felt that.

58
00:05:13,723 --> 00:05:17,105
Tell me that that wasn't just me.
We tapped into each other.

59
00:05:17,225 --> 00:05:19,251
No, I felt it. We tapped.

60
00:05:20,297 --> 00:05:23,701
There's something old
and good and wise

61
00:05:24,165 --> 00:05:26,502
deep down in you.
I have to know that person.

62
00:05:26,622 --> 00:05:27,997
Come on, cut it out.

63
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,830
Nobody who knows me
has ever called me wise.

64
00:05:31,214 --> 00:05:33,044
Then nobody really knows you.

65
00:05:38,123 --> 00:05:39,556
Are you blushing?

66
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:46,585
I don't want you to go.

67
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:52,716
I was planning on
just burning through,

68
00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:55,215
but if you have a place
for me to crash

69
00:05:55,335 --> 00:05:58,068
then for you,
I might just stick around

70
00:05:58,188 --> 00:05:59,510
- for a little bit.
- Stay.

71
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,745
Stay with me.

72
00:06:02,518 --> 00:06:04,248
I don't wanna ever leave this bed.

73
00:06:04,368 --> 00:06:07,159
Let's just screw
and do V until we starve.

74
00:06:09,731 --> 00:06:12,525
Sure. But, I mean,
let's hold off on the screwing.

75
00:06:12,645 --> 00:06:14,498
I'm a respectable girl.

76
00:06:15,103 --> 00:06:16,103
What?

77
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:18,089
Did I hurt you?

78
00:06:19,203 --> 00:06:22,025
I'm sorry if I got carried away,
it was just so amazing.

79
00:06:22,753 --> 00:06:24,095
We didn't have sex.

80
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,853
What do you call what we been doin'
for the past six hours?

81
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:30,732
We were together on V,

82
00:06:30,852 --> 00:06:33,562
deeper than I've ever felt
with anybody ever before.

83
00:06:33,722 --> 00:06:35,574
But physically, we barely touched.

84
00:06:37,644 --> 00:06:39,610
- I promise.
- That's not possible.

85
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,112
Panties still on.

86
00:06:48,203 --> 00:06:50,995
- What... the fuck?
- I told you.

87
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,624
It's better than sex.

88
00:07:02,696 --> 00:07:04,831
Jesus Christ,
what the hell are you doing?

89
00:07:04,951 --> 00:07:08,097
Opith the J.C.
I'm cleanin', what does it look like?

90
00:07:08,368 --> 00:07:11,559
- Watch your feet. I just waxed.
- I hope you mean the floor.

91
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:17,398
- Can I help you?
- I'm up to my elbows in Easy-Off.

92
00:07:18,867 --> 00:07:20,814
- My mama made me hoecakes this morning.
- So?

93
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:22,556
She cooked me breakfast.

94
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:25,372
When's the last time you saw
my mama lift a finger before noon

95
00:07:25,492 --> 00:07:27,743
for anything besides Mad Dog 20/20?

96
00:07:28,066 --> 00:07:30,114
We went into the woods to get a $445

97
00:07:30,234 --> 00:07:32,746
hoodoo exorcism last night.
You do not wanna get me started

98
00:07:32,907 --> 00:07:34,635
- on that.
- My grandmother's dead.

99
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:36,749
At least you got someone
to make breakfast for you.

100
00:07:36,869 --> 00:07:39,039
You ever stop thinkin' about
what's happening with others

101
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,700
- before you barge in on them?
- Sorry. I didn't me...

102
00:07:42,202 --> 00:07:44,089
Oh, my God, are those fang marks?

103
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:47,386
So what? It means someone cared for me
when everyone else left me high and dry.

104
00:07:47,546 --> 00:07:50,178
No wonder you're crazy.
A vampire made a meal of you.

105
00:07:50,298 --> 00:07:53,462
Why am I the only person that doesn't
think vampires are monsters?

106
00:07:53,582 --> 00:07:56,562
They drink our blood.
What's to say Bill won't leave you

107
00:07:56,722 --> 00:07:58,752
- once he's had his fill?
- Do you have any idea

108
00:07:58,872 --> 00:08:00,234
what I've been through today?

109
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,669
- A friend would ask.
- Don't tell me how to be your friend.

110
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:05,070
- I'm the only one you got, goddamn...
- Lord's name in vain.

111
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,264
- Fuck off.
- Get out of my house!

112
00:08:07,384 --> 00:08:10,932
I've gotten very good at losing people{\ like you}.
You are only making it easier for me.

113
00:08:11,052 --> 00:08:13,788
Bitch, I don't even wanna be here.
If you are hell-bent on being alone

114
00:08:13,908 --> 00:08:15,883
in this world,
I ain't gonna stop you.

115
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:29,349
Oh, man.

116
00:08:30,005 --> 00:08:32,269
I wanna not have sex
with you again so bad,

117
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:33,774
you don't even know.

118
00:08:33,996 --> 00:08:35,781
I think I got some idea.

119
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:39,667
But that V that we did
was the last I had.

120
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:42,914
Where do we score some more?

121
00:08:43,034 --> 00:08:45,006
When we need more,
we'll go out and get it.

122
00:08:46,105 --> 00:08:48,678
Don't be greedy.
We'll be okay for a while.

123
00:08:48,798 --> 00:08:51,565
- Just eat your breakfast.
- You sure you don't want some?

124
00:08:51,941 --> 00:08:55,369
- Pepperoni and sausage.
- No, thank you. I only eat organic.

125
00:08:55,489 --> 00:08:58,499
The cleaner my body is,
the more intensely I feel the V.

126
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,820
Why do you have two televisions
in the same room?

127
00:09:03,092 --> 00:09:06,326
The bottom one's busted. I just keep it
'cause it was my parents'.

128
00:09:09,123 --> 00:09:10,872
Can I ask you how they died?

129
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:16,871
- I don't like to talk about it.
- Okay.

130
00:09:20,797 --> 00:09:22,265
It was a flash flood.

131
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,252
They were caught on the bridge
down by the Parish Road

132
00:09:25,372 --> 00:09:26,902
and got swept out in the river.

133
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:29,096
My little sister and I...

134
00:09:29,931 --> 00:09:32,253
were staying at our gran's
while they went out.

135
00:09:32,729 --> 00:09:34,849
They didn't think I could
look after Sookie by myself,

136
00:09:34,969 --> 00:09:36,537
even though I was almost 11.

137
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,976
Sometimes I think,

138
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,980
if I was a better kid,

139
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,845
they wouldn't have had
to drop us off at Gran's.

140
00:09:48,335 --> 00:09:50,718
Then they wouldn't have been
on the bridge at the exact point

141
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,360
when...

142
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,366
So your grandma raised you
after that?

143
00:09:57,486 --> 00:09:58,977
Yeah, I moved back here

144
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,441
when I was 18,

145
00:10:02,109 --> 00:10:04,986
even though Gran would have
rather kept an eye on me.

146
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:07,670
Yeah, she passed too.

147
00:10:07,952 --> 00:10:08,952
Last week.

148
00:10:09,322 --> 00:10:11,130
God, I'm so sorry.

149
00:10:11,471 --> 00:10:12,481
Goddamn.

150
00:10:13,925 --> 00:10:16,508
I don't mean to be spillin'.
I never do this.

151
00:10:16,628 --> 00:10:18,424
You never talk about things

152
00:10:18,544 --> 00:10:21,012
with anybody?
You don't talk to your sister?

153
00:10:21,242 --> 00:10:22,498
Least of all her.

154
00:10:23,303 --> 00:10:24,956
She brings out the worst in me.

155
00:10:25,076 --> 00:10:27,296
We had this big fight
after Gran died

156
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,811
and I hit her.

157
00:10:29,668 --> 00:10:30,668
I tell you,

158
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,290
I am

159
00:10:34,558 --> 00:10:36,437
the worst brother in the world.

160
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,107
That's ridiculous.

161
00:10:41,595 --> 00:10:43,399
I've seen who you are inside.

162
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,764
I've been there.

163
00:10:47,165 --> 00:10:48,233
And you're good.

164
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:53,353
Do you hear me?

165
00:11:13,729 --> 00:11:16,265
She's a beauty.
You want it for your office?

166
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:19,353
We'll put it over the bar.

167
00:11:20,483 --> 00:11:22,514
Drunks like talking to the animals.

168
00:11:23,444 --> 00:11:24,478
Check it out.

169
00:11:25,034 --> 00:11:26,114
Possum prick.

170
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,646
- Where'd you get that?
- Shot one last week.

171
00:11:29,766 --> 00:11:32,274
It was gonna stuff it but I left it
back out. It got to raining,

172
00:11:32,394 --> 00:11:35,717
then three days later, ain't nothing
left but possum sludge and bones.

173
00:11:36,116 --> 00:11:39,043
I saved this, though.
Possums have a two-pronged penis.

174
00:11:39,306 --> 00:11:41,290
It's supposed to bring good luck.

175
00:11:42,116 --> 00:11:44,534
Terry, let's keep
that story between us.

176
00:11:45,065 --> 00:11:47,120
The girls might get the wrong idea.

177
00:11:55,095 --> 00:11:58,036
- What was you doing out this morning?
- Why?

178
00:11:58,644 --> 00:12:01,882
You wouldn't have been running through
the woods without no clothes on{\, would you}?

179
00:12:03,249 --> 00:12:05,450
- Why would I do that?
- I don't know.

180
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:07,280
That's why I'm asking.

181
00:12:07,683 --> 00:12:09,814
I was out fishin'
and I could have swore

182
00:12:09,975 --> 00:12:12,703
I saw you blazing buck-naked
through the trees.

183
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,153
It wasn't me.

184
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,757
I was working on my car.

185
00:12:20,297 --> 00:12:22,327
It looked an awful lot like you.

186
00:12:23,896 --> 00:12:25,587
Except you wear clothes.

187
00:12:32,426 --> 00:12:33,518
I don't know.

188
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:36,358
Maybe I'm seein' things again.

189
00:12:36,478 --> 00:12:39,601
Except usually when I see people
who ain't there, it's...

190
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:42,556
- It's the insurgents.
- Yeah.

191
00:12:44,893 --> 00:12:47,308
Only this fella I saw,
he didn't look like no insurgent.

192
00:12:47,428 --> 00:12:49,787
But you said he was running,
though, huh?

193
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,197
Plenty of cover in the trees.
How could you tell for sure?

194
00:12:55,296 --> 00:12:57,070
And I believe you saw what you saw.

195
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,177
I just don't know why anyone would
run naked through the woods

196
00:13:00,651 --> 00:13:02,260
- in broad daylight.
- Yeah.

197
00:13:03,354 --> 00:13:04,763
Maybe you're right.

198
00:13:06,008 --> 00:13:07,018
Shit.

199
00:13:09,343 --> 00:13:11,039
I hate bein' this way.

200
00:13:12,412 --> 00:13:13,764
It's all right, buddy.

201
00:13:14,152 --> 00:13:15,152
Come on.

202
00:13:16,652 --> 00:13:18,519
We're a long way from Fallujah.

203
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:52,561
COMPTON
BELOVED HUSBAND - BRAVE SOLDIER

204
00:16:15,637 --> 00:16:16,644
Not the neck.

205
00:16:29,943 --> 00:16:31,819
Where the hell is Sookie today?

206
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,912
Here you go, honey.
Sorry it took so long.

207
00:16:39,229 --> 00:16:40,744
Intense.

208
00:16:41,678 --> 00:16:45,045
All these animals on the wall,
it's like a natural history museum.

209
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,518
- I never noticed them.
- How could you not?

210
00:16:49,023 --> 00:16:52,320
Every one of these animals
lived a life full of experiences

211
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,002
that we can't even imagine.

212
00:16:54,122 --> 00:16:56,744
Does it weird you out?
We could go someplace else.

213
00:16:57,151 --> 00:16:59,053
Everyone has to eat, right?

214
00:16:59,405 --> 00:17:02,263
We're all links
on the universal food chain.

215
00:17:03,226 --> 00:17:04,784
See? Squirrel eats nuts,

216
00:17:04,904 --> 00:17:07,570
snake eats the squirrel,
gator eats the snake.

217
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,717
And we can eat pretty much
anything we want.

218
00:17:10,987 --> 00:17:12,581
It's the circle of life.

219
00:17:12,701 --> 00:17:14,995
Jesus Christ.
I wanna lick your mind.

220
00:17:15,115 --> 00:17:16,806
Let's have lunch first.

221
00:17:21,943 --> 00:17:22,943
Order up.

222
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,965
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I know I'm late.

223
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:30,158
Listen, I heard about the fire.
I'm real, real sorry.

224
00:17:30,278 --> 00:17:32,136
- How you holding up?
- He's alive.

225
00:17:33,528 --> 00:17:34,556
- What?
- Bill.

226
00:17:34,716 --> 00:17:37,557
They said four bodies.
I thought Bill was one of 'em.

227
00:17:37,677 --> 00:17:40,014
- He wasn't?
- He's fine. In fact,

228
00:17:40,897 --> 00:17:42,341
he's wonderful.

229
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,317
- That must be quite a relief for you.
- You have no idea. Anyways,

230
00:17:46,628 --> 00:17:48,789
no need to worry about me.
I'm great.

231
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,810
Sweetie, where you been?
I'm up to my eyeballs in tickets.

232
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,437
You look so beautiful today.

233
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:01,959
I love you, even if you are
a bigot sometimes.

234
00:18:04,662 --> 00:18:05,939
What's with her?

235
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:07,162
Bill's alive.

236
00:18:07,491 --> 00:18:08,968
What? But I thought...

237
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,592
I know. So did I.

238
00:18:10,752 --> 00:18:11,759
Order up.

239
00:18:12,205 --> 00:18:14,171
I'm comin'. Hold your horses.

240
00:18:14,876 --> 00:18:17,514
He got my message that something bad
might be brewing, so he figured

241
00:18:17,634 --> 00:18:20,393
- he spent the night in the graveyard.
- Doesn't it get cold out there?

242
00:18:20,553 --> 00:18:21,769
He was in the ground.

243
00:18:22,223 --> 00:18:25,446
So after I couldn't find him,
then hearing about those four bodies

244
00:18:25,566 --> 00:18:28,359
at that burnt-up house, you can imagine
what I was going through.

245
00:18:29,095 --> 00:18:31,185
{\I mean,}That must have been
something terrible.

246
00:18:31,305 --> 00:18:32,605
You don't know.

247
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:36,051
They said there was three vampires
that come in the other night.

248
00:18:36,171 --> 00:18:39,631
- Who's the fourth body?
- Some fangbanger, they're saying now.

249
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,998
Some vampires like to keep
a human around for sex...

250
00:18:43,242 --> 00:18:44,249
and blood.

251
00:18:47,398 --> 00:18:48,889
I'll get your Cokes.

252
00:18:52,093 --> 00:18:54,486
- I Thought you said "order up".
- I did. New girl took 'em.

253
00:18:54,606 --> 00:18:55,606
New girl?

254
00:18:56,984 --> 00:18:58,847
BLT, cheeseburger, well-done,

255
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:01,182
fried egg on white, hot wings,

256
00:19:01,302 --> 00:19:02,769
smoked sausage,

257
00:19:03,464 --> 00:19:04,732
tuna melt,

258
00:19:05,323 --> 00:19:08,059
and the chicken fried steak
must be for you.

259
00:19:08,852 --> 00:19:12,328
- Thank you. We've got a four-top open.
- Isn't she something?

260
00:19:13,783 --> 00:19:17,218
- She's with you.
- I know you're pissed at me, but...

261
00:19:18,834 --> 00:19:20,666
I really want you to like her.

262
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,957
Sorry about that.
You looked really swamped

263
00:19:25,117 --> 00:19:27,415
and the natives
were gettin' restless so...

264
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:29,629
You're Jason's sister, right?
It's...

265
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:31,509
I've heard so much about you.

266
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,174
- Who are you?
- My name's Amy.

267
00:19:33,446 --> 00:19:35,277
- Amy Burley. I'm with Jason.
- With me.

268
00:19:35,397 --> 00:19:38,681
You must be Arlene with the beautiful
red hair. It's so nice to meet you.

269
00:19:39,668 --> 00:19:41,286
How'd you know
all the table numbers?

270
00:19:41,406 --> 00:19:44,347
I waited tables in college
so I just assumed clockwise.

271
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:46,486
You know, Table 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

272
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:51,044
I think the guys at Table 5 like you,
'cause they left you a really nice tip.

273
00:19:52,702 --> 00:19:55,191
I think we might have found
a replacement for Dawn.

274
00:19:55,311 --> 00:19:56,697
Looks like you did too.

275
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:08,457
What?

276
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,756
Don't you touch that, sweetie pie.
Mama'll take care of the laundry.

277
00:20:14,876 --> 00:20:18,417
My goodness. Lettie Mae,
ain't she the spittin' image of you.

278
00:20:18,537 --> 00:20:20,078
That's a compliment.

279
00:20:20,198 --> 00:20:22,849
Tara Mae, you remember
Mable Simpkins, don't you?

280
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:25,213
- From the church.
- That's right. And why don't we see

281
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:28,613
- your smiling face there no more?
- 'Cause I stopped goin'.

282
00:20:29,432 --> 00:20:31,350
It's never too late to come back.

283
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,838
Lettie Mae left us for two years
and we welcomed her back today

284
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,863
- like she had never gone.
- I heard the call.

285
00:20:37,023 --> 00:20:38,865
The good Lord said, "Lettie Mae,

286
00:20:39,025 --> 00:20:41,467
"you been away too long.
Your church needs you. "

287
00:20:41,587 --> 00:20:43,256
You should have heard her testify.

288
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:45,888
The entire congregation
was filled with the spirit.

289
00:20:46,008 --> 00:20:47,940
Yeah, I bet she was full of it.

290
00:20:48,367 --> 00:20:51,502
- Your mama's an inspiration to us all.
- Glory to God.

291
00:20:52,949 --> 00:20:55,590
Girl, why don't you come
to Bible group on Tuesday?

292
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,147
Got plenty of nice young men
and fruit punch.

293
00:20:58,267 --> 00:21:00,365
A little religion do you
a world of good, baby girl.

294
00:21:00,485 --> 00:21:02,889
Shit. Are you even listening
to what you're sayin'?

295
00:21:03,302 --> 00:21:06,186
You can lie to yourself and
everyone else but when you go to bed,

296
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,773
you are just as fucked up
and miserable as I am.

297
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:11,321
And goin' to church
and wearing a crazy-ass hat

298
00:21:11,441 --> 00:21:13,149
ain't gonna make you
a better person.

299
00:21:15,178 --> 00:21:16,692
She got a demon in her.

300
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,175
My granddaughter had a demon in her.

301
00:21:19,434 --> 00:21:20,643
They everywhere.

302
00:21:21,442 --> 00:21:22,998
Sure, I understand.

303
00:21:23,547 --> 00:21:24,862
It's no problem.

304
00:21:29,546 --> 00:21:32,835
Every time I get a night off,
my babysitter falls through on me.

305
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:34,587
You know,

306
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:36,630
I like kids, Arlene.

307
00:21:38,556 --> 00:21:39,613
Donuts too.

308
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:42,130
Maybe,

309
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,598
if you brought a lady friend along.
Lisa likes a female in the house.

310
00:21:45,984 --> 00:21:48,017
I ain't had a lady friend
since I come home.

311
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:51,270
That's some bad luck for you,
I guess.

312
00:21:53,608 --> 00:21:55,316
Did something happen there

313
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:58,122
that you been...
keeping to yourself?

314
00:21:58,671 --> 00:22:01,490
'Cause you could talk to me,
you know, if you're wantin' to.

315
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:04,503
No, I'd...

316
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:07,151
I'd just as soon sit here
and listen at you.

317
00:22:07,765 --> 00:22:09,070
I like your voice.

318
00:22:09,908 --> 00:22:11,339
And your clavicles.

319
00:22:15,573 --> 00:22:17,686
I've been admiring
your necklace all day.

320
00:22:18,132 --> 00:22:20,936
Oh, thanks, it's a lariat.
I made it.

321
00:22:22,681 --> 00:22:24,246
You make jewelry?

322
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:28,746
It's a easy way to earn extra money.
I can make you one, if you want.

323
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,708
Thanks, but I don't think
my boyfriend much likes silver.

324
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,522
You know my brother's
a dog, don't you?

325
00:22:39,642 --> 00:22:40,642
I'm sorry?

326
00:22:41,165 --> 00:22:43,491
He's all charm and smiles
in the beginning,

327
00:22:43,611 --> 00:22:45,499
but the second he gets tired of you,

328
00:22:45,755 --> 00:22:47,464
he's gonna stop callin'.

329
00:22:47,584 --> 00:22:50,372
Before you know it,
he's off with some other floozy.

330
00:22:52,535 --> 00:22:54,413
Not... Not that you are one.

331
00:22:55,065 --> 00:22:57,622
But trust me, it's as regular
as the seasons.

332
00:22:58,403 --> 00:23:01,216
You seem like a sweet girl.
I don't want you to get hurt.

333
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,713
You know,

334
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:08,932
I don't think Jason's realized
even half of what he's going to be.

335
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:13,519
I wouldn't be so quick to judge. You
might be surprised at what he's capable.

336
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:24,512
- I've been meaning to talk to you.
- What's the matter?

337
00:23:24,632 --> 00:23:26,621
I've just been a mess lately.

338
00:23:26,741 --> 00:23:29,183
You know, with the kids
and the double shifts

339
00:23:29,303 --> 00:23:32,565
and Rene and everything,
it's been awful hard.

340
00:23:32,685 --> 00:23:35,923
And I've probably said
some things that I don't mean,

341
00:23:36,043 --> 00:23:37,962
but that's the pressure talking.

342
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:40,284
I love you like my own sister.

343
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:42,516
And you know that, right?

344
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:45,427
I appreciate that. Thank you.

345
00:23:48,015 --> 00:23:50,297
And sure, I'll babysit
your kids tonight.

346
00:23:50,623 --> 00:23:53,689
- I... I didn't... I mean...
- I heard you talkin' to Terry.

347
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:55,362
I'm a better choice.

348
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,398
We'll drop 'em off at 8.

349
00:23:59,518 --> 00:24:03,278
Rene's taking me to Ruston
to see that Oak Ridge Boys tribute band.

350
00:24:04,005 --> 00:24:05,005
Ooh. Fun.

351
00:24:18,786 --> 00:24:21,778
You look mighty pretty tonight, Tara.
That's a nice color on you.

352
00:24:21,898 --> 00:24:22,908
Fuck you.

353
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,088
I'm sorry, w...

354
00:24:24,513 --> 00:24:25,759
Was that sexist?

355
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:29,028
May I have a word with you?

356
00:24:29,148 --> 00:24:30,191
In my office.

357
00:24:35,252 --> 00:24:38,086
Hey, I get it. You said yourself
hirin' me might not work out.

358
00:24:38,206 --> 00:24:39,352
I piss people off.

359
00:24:39,472 --> 00:24:42,312
If you wanna fire me, fire me.
I totally understand.

360
00:24:42,687 --> 00:24:45,152
You and I
are the only ones who get it.

361
00:24:47,249 --> 00:24:49,649
It's everybody else
who's fuckin' themselves up.

362
00:25:05,242 --> 00:25:08,295
I mean, you've been doin' it
for over a hundred years.

363
00:25:09,351 --> 00:25:10,982
Doesn't it get predictable?

364
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:13,568
Not with you, it doesn't.

365
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,343
You're entirely different.

366
00:25:19,263 --> 00:25:22,107
And the beauty
and the tragedy of it is...

367
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:26,348
Is that you don't know
just how different you are.

368
00:25:28,865 --> 00:25:31,396
Please tell me
if I'm doin' something wrong.

369
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:36,670
There's nothing more natural
than the act of makin' love.

370
00:25:39,533 --> 00:25:42,023
Who am I to try to change
what comes naturally to you?

371
00:25:42,143 --> 00:25:44,228
But if you could change something...

372
00:25:45,683 --> 00:25:47,314
I wouldn't change a thing.

373
00:26:00,467 --> 00:26:02,646
What's it like
to sleep in the ground?

374
00:26:04,865 --> 00:26:06,939
It's not exactly comfortable.

375
00:26:09,716 --> 00:26:10,877
But it is safe.

376
00:26:12,978 --> 00:26:16,786
Which, if I recall, is what the three
voice mails required of me that night.

377
00:26:20,472 --> 00:26:21,528
Oh, crap.

378
00:26:22,493 --> 00:26:25,293
Arlene. I forgot, I told her
I'd babysit the kids.

379
00:26:25,706 --> 00:26:26,750
Shall I go?

380
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,416
Stay. It'll be good for her.

381
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:33,890
You can put some pants on, though.

382
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,819
What's wrong?
What took you so long?

383
00:26:48,939 --> 00:26:50,818
I was out back in the yard.

384
00:26:50,938 --> 00:26:53,323
- In your nightie?
- The cat got out.

385
00:26:53,944 --> 00:26:56,450
- Made friends with a squirrel.
- Mommy, look, it's a vampire.

386
00:26:58,096 --> 00:26:59,996
You didn't mention
that you had company.

387
00:27:00,281 --> 00:27:01,923
I didn't think I had to.

388
00:27:02,043 --> 00:27:05,056
Well, I got a right to know
who's looking after my children.

389
00:27:06,455 --> 00:27:07,524
Here we are.

390
00:27:08,216 --> 00:27:09,455
Is there a problem?

391
00:27:11,718 --> 00:27:13,374
Take it easy, <i>chère.</i>

392
00:27:13,494 --> 00:27:16,778
Mr. Compton's raised a couple of them
little ones himself maybe, yeah?

393
00:27:17,028 --> 00:27:18,267
That's quite right.

394
00:27:21,528 --> 00:27:23,156
Keep these on you,

395
00:27:23,506 --> 00:27:24,506
you hear?

396
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,640
And...

397
00:27:27,264 --> 00:27:29,190
stay close to your Aunt Sookie.

398
00:27:29,487 --> 00:27:31,222
They'll be fine, I promise.

399
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,535
- Who wants pizza?
- Me.

400
00:27:33,655 --> 00:27:35,321
Good, 'cause that's what
we're havin'.

401
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:36,809
You can eat pizza?

402
00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:38,703
Well, unfortunately, no,

403
00:27:39,063 --> 00:27:40,861
but I understand it's delicious.

404
00:27:44,074 --> 00:27:46,465
You know what's good about sex
that people never mention?

405
00:27:47,095 --> 00:27:49,782
For anywhere
between five minutes to an hour,

406
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,980
you forget your own fucked-up life.

407
00:27:52,568 --> 00:27:53,881
Only if it's good.

408
00:27:54,567 --> 00:27:57,470
If it's not, it reminds you
just how bad your life really is.

409
00:27:57,796 --> 00:27:59,729
Then I guess you're pretty good.

410
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:01,933
Thanks, you're not bad yourself.

411
00:28:04,045 --> 00:28:05,746
Easy on the praise, honey.

412
00:28:08,244 --> 00:28:09,244
What?

413
00:28:10,123 --> 00:28:12,319
- No, you're good.
- But?

414
00:28:12,645 --> 00:28:15,805
Nothing.
It's good. You're good.

415
00:28:16,156 --> 00:28:18,237
- What am I doin' wrong?
- Nothin'.

416
00:28:20,392 --> 00:28:23,204
I... See... It's so minor,
it doesn't even matter.

417
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:24,371
What is it?

418
00:28:24,617 --> 00:28:26,581
- Don't do this to me.
- Spit it out.

419
00:28:27,236 --> 00:28:28,371
Sometimes...

420
00:28:30,094 --> 00:28:31,094
you grunt.

421
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:32,747
- I what?

422
00:28:32,867 --> 00:28:35,791
It's... It's natural. Nothing to get
worked up over. It's just a sound.

423
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:38,165
A gruntin' sound?
Like a farm animal?

424
00:28:39,727 --> 00:28:41,513
No, it's... It's... It's athletic.

425
00:28:41,842 --> 00:28:43,898
Like tennis players when they serve.

426
00:28:44,109 --> 00:28:45,492
You mean like Serena?

427
00:28:47,262 --> 00:28:49,354
What, because I'm black,
I sound like Serena Williams?

428
00:28:49,514 --> 00:28:52,566
- That's not what I said.
- You racist son of a bitch.

429
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:55,437
How can I be racist?
I just had sex with you.

430
00:28:55,557 --> 00:28:56,711
You asshole.

431
00:28:56,831 --> 00:28:59,113
Why'd you have to go and take
the only good 10 minutes

432
00:28:59,233 --> 00:29:01,515
of my entire day
and ruin it like that?

433
00:29:02,578 --> 00:29:06,198
- I think it was more than 10 minutes.
- Oh, fuck you. Fuck you all.

434
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:09,285
- All who?
- Everybody. Fuck everybody!

435
00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:16,547
<i>Whipped cream.</i>

436
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:17,966
- Yeah.
- Me too.

437
00:29:18,086 --> 00:29:20,303
I hope you can finish this
before your mother comes back.

438
00:29:20,423 --> 00:29:22,639
No problem. I ate a whole jar
of mayonnaise once.

439
00:29:23,257 --> 00:29:24,592
I had to watch.

440
00:29:25,175 --> 00:29:26,861
How come you can't have ice cream?

441
00:29:26,981 --> 00:29:29,813
You might say
that I'm lactose intolerant.

442
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:31,987
Just like my Aunt Fern.

443
00:29:32,107 --> 00:29:34,515
Except she don't tolerate Mexicans.

444
00:29:35,054 --> 00:29:37,118
Aunt Sookie, is Bill your boyfriend?

445
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:41,095
Bill, would you say that you're
my boyfriend?

446
00:29:41,743 --> 00:29:44,642
Well, I suppose I'd have to ask
permission from Coby and Lisa.

447
00:29:45,169 --> 00:29:47,752
Would it be all right if I was
Aunt Sookie's boyfriend?

448
00:29:47,872 --> 00:29:49,230
Do you buy her flowers?

449
00:29:50,108 --> 00:29:51,542
Why, no, I haven't yet.

450
00:29:52,077 --> 00:29:54,252
You better. Rene buys flowers
for Mama all the time.

451
00:29:54,457 --> 00:29:56,292
Then I will have to mend my ways.

452
00:29:56,412 --> 00:29:58,140
You do that. Then we'll talk.

453
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:00,342
Can we see your fangs?

454
00:30:00,657 --> 00:30:02,510
I don't think
that's gonna be possible.

455
00:30:02,921 --> 00:30:03,964
Why, certainly.

456
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,443
I think we got a flat tire.

457
00:30:16,768 --> 00:30:18,807
Come on, baby,
the kids are waitin' on us.

458
00:30:18,927 --> 00:30:22,263
I don't wanna leave them with
that vampire longer than I have to.

459
00:30:22,383 --> 00:30:25,034
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
I'm gettin' to it, woman.

460
00:30:31,215 --> 00:30:32,215
Baby.

461
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:33,441
What?

462
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:35,262
Pass me that Maglite, will you?

463
00:30:48,585 --> 00:30:50,215
Crap, it's burnt out.

464
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,231
Are you sure?

465
00:30:53,096 --> 00:30:54,274
You better check it.

466
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,274
I just put some fresh batteries
in there.

467
00:31:07,895 --> 00:31:09,098
Arlene Fowler...

468
00:31:10,905 --> 00:31:12,280
would you do me the honor

469
00:31:13,089 --> 00:31:14,250
of bein' my wife?

470
00:31:26,192 --> 00:31:28,949
Why didn't you say anything
at the Red Lobster?

471
00:31:30,811 --> 00:31:32,500
I know I've done it
four other times,

472
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,901
but it never gets old.

473
00:31:34,021 --> 00:31:36,480
Oh, I'm so thrilled for you two.

474
00:31:37,392 --> 00:31:39,231
Would you be a bridesmaid
for me again?

475
00:31:39,392 --> 00:31:42,310
Why, of course.
You hardly have to ask.

476
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:45,236
Oh, honey, I love you so much.

477
00:31:47,487 --> 00:31:49,248
Maybe you two are next, huh?

478
00:31:52,071 --> 00:31:54,002
Well, I mean, when it becomes legal.

479
00:31:57,311 --> 00:31:59,047
Mommy, what's going on?

480
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,456
Sweetie,

481
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:02,726
you're gonna be my flower girl.

482
00:32:11,435 --> 00:32:12,517
Morning, dear.

483
00:32:15,692 --> 00:32:16,911
Did you make all this?

484
00:32:17,031 --> 00:32:19,516
I borrowed some of
your grandmother's old recipes.

485
00:32:20,207 --> 00:32:21,850
But the handiwork is all mine.

486
00:32:22,346 --> 00:32:24,316
I don't even know where to begin.

487
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:27,753
Well, I would start with the biscuits.
They just came out of the oven.

488
00:32:31,611 --> 00:32:33,162
Gonna be clear skies all day.

489
00:32:33,488 --> 00:32:35,157
Wait, Bill, it's light out.

490
00:32:39,101 --> 00:32:40,483
I suppose it is.

491
00:32:53,731 --> 00:32:55,439
No. No, I'll make the call.

492
00:32:56,096 --> 00:32:58,600
His mama passed a couple years back,
but he had some

493
00:32:58,913 --> 00:33:00,257
family in Kentucky.

494
00:33:00,377 --> 00:33:02,590
His dentist confirmed the match
just a bit ago.

495
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,678
I thought you should be
the first to know.

496
00:33:06,034 --> 00:33:07,034
Goddammit.

497
00:33:07,773 --> 00:33:08,773
Why Neil?

498
00:33:09,745 --> 00:33:11,428
He was such a quiet kid.

499
00:33:11,767 --> 00:33:14,076
I'd have never thought
he'd get mixed up with fangers.

500
00:33:15,928 --> 00:33:16,745
Damn.

501
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:19,490
To have nothing left of you
to ID but teeth.

502
00:33:20,464 --> 00:33:23,663
You wanna maybe let one of
the homes in Monroe handle him?

503
00:33:30,221 --> 00:33:32,151
He worked for me. I owe it to him.

504
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:35,558
Give me a couple hours,
I'll come over and claim him, okay?

505
00:33:36,101 --> 00:33:37,640
Okay. Thanks, Mike.

506
00:33:46,574 --> 00:33:47,581
Pretty tore up?

507
00:33:47,701 --> 00:33:48,911
Blind-sided him.

508
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,520
Had no idea Neil was a fangbanger.

509
00:33:52,427 --> 00:33:54,280
Jesus, Bud, the kid was creepy.

510
00:33:55,062 --> 00:33:57,827
What 19 year-old goes to work
for a funeral home?

511
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:00,792
I worked in a slaughterhouse
when I was 15.

512
00:34:01,405 --> 00:34:03,140
They made me clean chitlins.

513
00:34:05,706 --> 00:34:08,875
Speaking of freaks...

514
00:34:15,963 --> 00:34:16,963
<i>And that's it.</i>

515
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:20,399
I got no control over what people do
after they leave the bar.

516
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:23,004
You remember anyone
being unusually angry

517
00:34:23,124 --> 00:34:25,148
over what those vampires
did to your bar?

518
00:34:25,268 --> 00:34:26,734
Everyone.
We were all angry.

519
00:34:27,189 --> 00:34:29,524
Heck, you might as well
interrogate the whole town.

520
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:32,078
Between you and me,

521
00:34:32,633 --> 00:34:34,797
I wouldn't be heartbroken
if you didn't find who did it.

522
00:34:34,917 --> 00:34:36,310
You know what I'm sayin'?

523
00:34:36,934 --> 00:34:40,211
Old Mrs. Stackhouse, on the other hand,
now that's a real tragedy.

524
00:34:41,202 --> 00:34:44,136
Her and Dawn and Maudette Pickens,
one right after the other.

525
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,005
You fellas got any leads on that?

526
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:50,343
We're workin' on some right now.

527
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,574
Good. I'm pullin' for you guys.

528
00:34:56,071 --> 00:34:58,725
You remember anything else,
we'll be havin' a burger inside.

529
00:34:59,475 --> 00:35:00,662
Come on, Andy.

530
00:35:10,671 --> 00:35:12,119
One other thing.

531
00:35:13,339 --> 00:35:16,509
You recall spendin' any time
out in the woods lately?

532
00:35:20,088 --> 00:35:21,088
Some.

533
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:24,501
But you knew that already,
didn't you?

534
00:35:30,143 --> 00:35:31,143
If...

535
00:35:31,471 --> 00:35:32,843
If I tell you,

536
00:35:34,022 --> 00:35:35,601
You have to keep this a secret.

537
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,209
All right, nobody in town knows.

538
00:35:40,711 --> 00:35:43,811
But, I come from
a family of naturists.

539
00:35:44,137 --> 00:35:45,429
Like bird watchers?

540
00:35:45,549 --> 00:35:47,829
No. No, not naturalists.
Naturists.

541
00:35:49,055 --> 00:35:50,718
Naturists believe in

542
00:35:51,056 --> 00:35:51,957
a freer

543
00:35:52,077 --> 00:35:54,363
clothing-optional kind of lifestyle.

544
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:56,798
You're a nudist?

545
00:35:57,381 --> 00:35:59,168
No. Good Lord, no.

546
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:01,997
But my folks were,

547
00:36:02,266 --> 00:36:04,071
I'm embarrassed to say.

548
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:07,410
They spent most of their lives
at a nudist colony.

549
00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:09,378
Oh, yeah? Around here?

550
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:12,757
No, in Texas, just outside Beaumont.

551
00:36:14,469 --> 00:36:15,469
But,

552
00:36:16,868 --> 00:36:18,329
ever since they passed,

553
00:36:18,449 --> 00:36:20,641
I honor their memory
once a year by...

554
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:24,475
taking a run through the woods
the way they used to. It's...

555
00:36:25,146 --> 00:36:26,813
It's my private way of mourning.

556
00:36:27,261 --> 00:36:29,009
I'm sorry if anybody had to see it.

557
00:36:40,228 --> 00:36:41,228
What?

558
00:36:41,883 --> 00:36:44,063
Hooker, you done got took.

559
00:36:44,724 --> 00:36:48,399
That was no damn exorcism,
that was a straight-up con job.

560
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:50,318
You know what
the fucked-up thing is?

561
00:36:50,438 --> 00:36:51,788
- What?
- It worked.

562
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,023
It was like aliens beamed down
and switched out her brain.

563
00:36:55,143 --> 00:36:57,525
Then that was 445 well-spent.

564
00:36:57,929 --> 00:36:59,872
Shit. Happy dance.

565
00:37:00,617 --> 00:37:02,482
You should be glad
to be rid of that...

566
00:37:02,937 --> 00:37:05,016
- That's your mom. I ain't gonna say it.
- Fuck that.

567
00:37:05,345 --> 00:37:07,201
All the shit you've built up

568
00:37:07,321 --> 00:37:10,770
doesn't go away because a hoodoo woman
moves some rocks around on your belly.

569
00:37:11,022 --> 00:37:12,624
I thought you said it worked.

570
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:15,024
I thought you said it was a con job.

571
00:37:15,144 --> 00:37:17,888
Heifer, it's not a con job
if you got your money's worth.

572
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,683
Hell.

573
00:37:19,803 --> 00:37:21,055
And who knows?

574
00:37:21,876 --> 00:37:23,468
It might do you some good too.

575
00:37:23,588 --> 00:37:26,494
I don't have another 445
to waste on bullshit.

576
00:37:26,614 --> 00:37:29,367
You just saying that
'cause you don't understand it.

577
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,244
And trust me,

578
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:34,572
this world is filled with things
we will never understand.

579
00:37:36,326 --> 00:37:39,418
Compared to a lifetime
of Zoloft, 445's a bargain.

580
00:37:46,494 --> 00:37:48,684
- Hey, what you doing?
- Vitamin.

581
00:37:49,197 --> 00:37:51,279
I've never seen you
take a vitamin before.

582
00:37:51,718 --> 00:37:52,809
So what?

583
00:37:52,929 --> 00:37:55,681
You've never seen me
put on deodorant or wash my hair

584
00:37:55,801 --> 00:37:58,710
or feed my cat, have you?
But I do all those things.

585
00:37:59,035 --> 00:38:01,193
I don't need a permission slip
from you.

586
00:38:16,563 --> 00:38:17,563
Christ.

587
00:38:26,019 --> 00:38:27,019
Good day?

588
00:38:29,504 --> 00:38:30,621
I need V.

589
00:38:31,899 --> 00:38:33,140
What?

590
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,987
I thought you said
you didn't need any again until...

591
00:38:36,107 --> 00:38:38,075
- you needed it again.
- Well, I need it.

592
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,176
Look me in the eye.

593
00:38:44,678 --> 00:38:46,331
Tell me that you don't want it too.

594
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,911
Yeah, of course I do,

595
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:51,030
but Lafayette won't sell it to me.

596
00:39:32,668 --> 00:39:34,443
I texted you three times.

597
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:38,981
- Why didn't you reply?
- I hate using the number keys to type.

598
00:39:40,548 --> 00:39:42,048
What are you listenin' to?

599
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:44,690
From my younger days.

600
00:39:45,828 --> 00:39:48,053
It's really quite beautiful
if you know Old Swedish.

601
00:39:51,285 --> 00:39:53,167
I have a favor to ask of you.

602
00:39:53,986 --> 00:39:55,486
A favor or an order?

603
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,524
Depends on how you look at it.

604
00:40:03,629 --> 00:40:04,731
Honestly,

605
00:40:05,066 --> 00:40:07,489
did you think
you could keep her to yourself?

606
00:40:13,141 --> 00:40:15,664
It feels a little like stalking,
don't it?

607
00:40:18,957 --> 00:40:21,255
It's the most natural thing
in the world.

608
00:40:21,529 --> 00:40:22,539
The hunt.

609
00:40:23,299 --> 00:40:26,662
People used to do this {\all the time}before
we got complacent with cloned beef

610
00:40:26,782 --> 00:40:28,653
and prepackaged dinners.

611
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,077
Headlights off.

612
00:40:53,614 --> 00:40:54,873
You done this before?

613
00:40:54,993 --> 00:40:57,444
Stay five lengths behind,
10 if we get on the Parish Road.

614
00:41:26,668 --> 00:41:28,321
Well, hey there, sweetness.

615
00:41:28,689 --> 00:41:29,863
You ready to party?

616
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:34,215
I'll take that as a yes.

617
00:41:34,933 --> 00:41:35,786
Nasty.

618
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,683
I bought this specially for you.

619
00:41:58,578 --> 00:42:00,185
I remember you said

620
00:42:00,553 --> 00:42:02,437
you go for merlot.

621
00:42:02,773 --> 00:42:04,766
I said I worked at Merlotte's.

622
00:42:05,204 --> 00:42:07,276
But whatever.
Pour me some anyhow.

623
00:42:42,391 --> 00:42:45,100
All right, baby.
Eddie juice first.

624
00:42:46,033 --> 00:42:47,151
Then we play.

625
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,843
Oh, there it is.

626
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:27,286
I always look forward
to Monday nights.

627
00:43:28,269 --> 00:43:30,065
First Heroes, then...

628
00:43:30,845 --> 00:43:31,652
you.

629
00:43:34,757 --> 00:43:37,908
What fun is it being a vampire
if all you do is watch TV?

630
00:43:38,413 --> 00:43:39,944
Well, I like TV.

631
00:43:41,903 --> 00:43:43,936
I'm just sayin'
you should try the bars.

632
00:43:44,056 --> 00:43:46,084
I know you like getting laid too.

633
00:43:46,204 --> 00:43:48,086
Why should I go to the bars?

634
00:43:48,897 --> 00:43:50,087
I got this.

635
00:43:58,181 --> 00:44:00,094
You like me, don't you, Lafayette?

636
00:44:04,573 --> 00:44:06,058
Sure, I like you.

637
00:44:08,509 --> 00:44:09,530
I mean...

638
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,996
even if I wasn't helping out
with the blood, you'd still

639
00:44:14,729 --> 00:44:15,909
want me, right?

640
00:44:17,338 --> 00:44:19,199
Why you even got to ask me that?

641
00:44:21,547 --> 00:44:22,954
I'd hate to think

642
00:44:23,626 --> 00:44:25,652
it's just business for you
when you come over.

643
00:44:25,772 --> 00:44:26,839
Of course not.

644
00:44:27,909 --> 00:44:30,669
What, you think I fool around
with all my business associates?

645
00:44:32,558 --> 00:44:33,982
Ah, there we go.

646
00:44:42,149 --> 00:44:45,809
Now show me what
a dirty old vampire you is.

647
00:45:10,463 --> 00:45:12,147
I want you so bad...

648
00:45:13,663 --> 00:45:14,726
I ache.

649
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:23,911
Well, come on, baby.

650
00:45:24,951 --> 00:45:26,527
I'll take care of you.

651
00:45:34,406 --> 00:45:36,193
You said you wanted
to go out tonight.

652
00:45:36,564 --> 00:45:38,602
I did not mean Fangtasia.

653
00:45:38,785 --> 00:45:40,581
I mean, really,
all those pathetic people

654
00:45:40,701 --> 00:45:43,316
who come here looking
for sex with vampires.

655
00:45:43,436 --> 00:45:45,118
I know. It's despicable.

656
00:45:45,861 --> 00:45:47,330
You know what I mean.

657
00:45:47,805 --> 00:45:50,024
So, what, five, 10 minutes?

658
00:45:50,193 --> 00:45:52,258
As long as Eric requires us.

659
00:45:52,378 --> 00:45:54,586
You mean as long as he requires me.

660
00:45:54,871 --> 00:45:57,289
Didn't even have the decency
to ask me himself.

661
00:45:57,409 --> 00:46:00,133
You are mine. He didn't need
to ask your permission.

662
00:46:00,293 --> 00:46:02,386
He cannot check me out
like a library book.

663
00:46:02,506 --> 00:46:04,304
Unfortunately, Sookie, he can.

664
00:46:04,693 --> 00:46:07,295
- Eric is sheriff of Area 5.
- Sheriff?

665
00:46:07,555 --> 00:46:09,632
It's a position of great power
among our kind.

666
00:46:09,752 --> 00:46:11,407
We do not wanna anger him.

667
00:46:11,851 --> 00:46:15,779
As long as the requests are reasonable,
we should accede to his wishes.

668
00:46:35,992 --> 00:46:38,517
I had this crazy dream this morning.

669
00:46:39,436 --> 00:46:41,441
We were sitting, eating breakfast,

670
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:44,994
and all of a sudden
the sunlight set you on fire.

671
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:52,774
It wouldn't happen quite that way.

672
00:46:55,593 --> 00:46:57,524
The sunlight would
severely weaken me

673
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,417
and eventually, of course,
I would die.

674
00:47:01,888 --> 00:47:03,740
But I wouldn't burst into flames.

675
00:47:07,364 --> 00:47:08,910
Not right away, at least.

676
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,599
So I guess

677
00:47:13,439 --> 00:47:15,522
we'll never have breakfast together.

678
00:47:38,142 --> 00:47:39,596
I knew you'd come.

679
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:43,111
Let's go inside.

680
00:47:48,109 --> 00:47:49,742
<i>No, I'm quite certain.</i>

681
00:47:49,902 --> 00:47:51,935
We keep extensive records here.

682
00:47:52,055 --> 00:47:55,226
All the way back to 1958.

683
00:47:56,245 --> 00:47:58,209
Never had anybody
by the name of Merlotte here.

684
00:47:58,479 --> 00:48:01,045
And you're sure you're the only
nudist colony in the area?

685
00:48:01,329 --> 00:48:02,505
Naturist community.

686
00:48:02,875 --> 00:48:04,299
<i>We're the first, finest and only</i>

687
00:48:04,459 --> 00:48:07,196
clothing-optional sanctuary
in all of Jefferson County.

688
00:48:07,316 --> 00:48:08,375
<i>All right.</i>

689
00:48:08,742 --> 00:48:11,432
- Thanks very much.
- <i>You come visit us, you hear?</i>

690
00:48:11,799 --> 00:48:13,099
Got a barbecue every month.

691
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:22,140
Pam, Longshadow and I
are partners in this club.

692
00:48:23,089 --> 00:48:27,032
And we recently noticed that $60,000
has gone missing from our books.

693
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:30,258
And Bruce...

694
00:48:32,464 --> 00:48:34,055
is our accountant.

695
00:48:34,447 --> 00:48:36,998
- Perhaps you can listen to him.
- He's not saying anything.

696
00:48:37,284 --> 00:48:38,445
Don't be coy.

697
00:48:40,078 --> 00:48:42,794
It's humbling enough to turn
to a human for assistance.

698
00:48:45,186 --> 00:48:48,092
- We know what you can do.
- And I know what you can do too.

699
00:48:48,822 --> 00:48:50,451
Why don't you just glamour him?

700
00:48:50,571 --> 00:48:53,553
Now, don't you think we tried everything
before summoning you?

701
00:48:54,762 --> 00:48:55,762
So...

702
00:48:55,921 --> 00:48:57,972
it would be a great favor to me

703
00:48:59,931 --> 00:49:01,522
and to Mr. Compton if you help us.

704
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,611
If I find out who did it, then what?

705
00:49:06,995 --> 00:49:10,761
We'll turn that person over to police
and let the authorities handle it.

706
00:49:11,183 --> 00:49:13,867
Hundreds of years old
and you're still a terrible liar.

707
00:49:14,029 --> 00:49:15,039
Come on.

708
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:17,690
I'll make you a deal.

709
00:49:18,704 --> 00:49:22,163
If you promise to hand over
the person who did this to the police,

710
00:49:22,909 --> 00:49:25,266
I'll agree to help you
any time you want.

711
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,346
All right.

712
00:49:28,993 --> 00:49:29,801
Why not?

713
00:49:36,801 --> 00:49:40,458
<i>Shit, what's this crazy bitch doing?
Why did I agree to work for vampires?</i>

714
00:49:40,578 --> 00:49:44,340
<i>Goddamn it, I knew it was a bad idea.
I've been straight with these fuckers.</i>

715
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,067
<i>Gotta be an idiot
to steal from them.</i>

716
00:49:46,228 --> 00:49:48,861
<i>Jesus Christ, I was the one
who reported it.</i>

717
00:49:49,215 --> 00:49:51,434
Bruce, it's okay.
Take a deep breath.

718
00:49:53,473 --> 00:49:55,110
Did you steal their money?

719
00:50:00,399 --> 00:50:03,042
No, no. You gotta believe me.
I didn't do it. I swear to...

720
00:50:04,593 --> 00:50:06,093
Do you know who did?

721
00:50:09,041 --> 00:50:12,042
<i>No, I wish. I would turn
that fucker in. Who was it?</i>

722
00:50:12,162 --> 00:50:14,083
<i>Couldn't have been Ginger.
She's too dumb.</i>

723
00:50:14,203 --> 00:50:16,654
<i>Although she's hot as shit.
I'd fuck her if I could.</i>

724
00:50:16,774 --> 00:50:18,382
He's tellin' the truth.

725
00:50:18,502 --> 00:50:21,060
You trust the skinny human
to clear the fat one?

726
00:50:25,542 --> 00:50:26,889
Bring the next one in.

727
00:51:23,953 --> 00:51:25,441
You got cash?
Are you buying?

728
00:51:25,561 --> 00:51:29,038
Just remember your lines, that's all I
need from you. I'll handle the rest.

729
00:51:29,267 --> 00:51:30,954
I'm not gonna
have to have sex with him?

730
00:51:31,074 --> 00:51:32,984
I said that I will handle it.

731
00:51:36,925 --> 00:51:39,124
I know you probably don't think
I'm all that smart,

732
00:51:39,244 --> 00:51:41,599
but I do know that that vampire
can kill us both

733
00:51:41,864 --> 00:51:43,441
before we even get in the door.

734
00:51:45,765 --> 00:51:46,944
You'll handle it.

735
00:51:49,632 --> 00:51:50,608
What {\the hell }is that?

736
00:51:51,076 --> 00:51:54,213
<i>While the wing nuts on the left
keep pushing their so-called</i>

737
00:51:54,333 --> 00:51:56,030
<i>vampire-rights legislation,</i>

738
00:51:56,611 --> 00:51:59,360
<i>I'm more concerned
with basic human rights.</i>

739
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,262
<i>The right for our sons and daughters</i>

740
00:52:01,382 --> 00:52:04,306
<i>to go to school without fear
of molestation</i>

741
00:52:04,426 --> 00:52:06,648
<i>by a bloodthirsty predator
in the playground</i>

742
00:52:07,221 --> 00:52:08,461
<i>or in the classroom.</i>

743
00:52:08,581 --> 00:52:11,428
<i>Someone has got to take a stand
for public safety</i>

744
00:52:11,548 --> 00:52:13,739
<i>over permissiveness and immorality.</i>

745
00:52:14,144 --> 00:52:17,053
<i>If you ask me, he's protesting
a little too hard.</i>

746
00:52:17,422 --> 00:52:19,414
<i>Come out of the closet,
Reverend Steve.</i>

747
00:52:19,534 --> 00:52:22,765
<i>I know plenty of friendly vampires
who'd like to take a bite out of you.</i>

748
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:28,895
<i>Oh, but truly, it's inflammatory talk
from folks like Steve Newlin</i>

749
00:52:29,328 --> 00:52:32,113
<i>who make me ashamed
to call myself a human.</i>

750
00:52:33,564 --> 00:52:34,883
<i>Thanks for watching.</i>

751
00:52:35,003 --> 00:52:36,289
<i>We'll be bite back.</i>

752
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:47,588
Who is it?

753
00:52:48,262 --> 00:52:50,242
I'm a friend of Lafayette Reynolds.

754
00:52:50,362 --> 00:52:52,033
He sent me for you.

755
00:53:00,196 --> 00:53:01,429
Jesus Christ.

756
00:53:01,589 --> 00:53:03,124
- Get his feet.
- Are you kidding?

757
00:53:03,244 --> 00:53:04,724
- Get his feet!
- Okay, okay.

758
00:53:05,008 --> 00:53:07,518
No, please! I'll give you
anything you want.

759
00:53:07,638 --> 00:53:09,520
- Shut up!
- Amy, what the hell?

760
00:53:09,696 --> 00:53:10,938
No names, dumb ass.

761
00:53:11,098 --> 00:53:12,898
I thought we'd take
a little blood and go.

762
00:53:13,058 --> 00:53:14,763
- Shut the fuck up.
- Jeez.

763
00:53:14,883 --> 00:53:16,711
- Now, come on, lift.
- What?

764
00:53:16,831 --> 00:53:17,737
Lift him up.

765
00:53:21,562 --> 00:53:23,159
Please! No!

766
00:53:23,698 --> 00:53:26,465
No! I'll do anything
you want. Please.

767
00:53:39,482 --> 00:53:41,635
This is the last of our humans.

768
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,763
Yummy.

769
00:53:45,745 --> 00:53:47,934
This woman has some
questions for you.

770
00:53:48,104 --> 00:53:50,071
Be a good girl
and answer them, will you?

771
00:53:50,191 --> 00:53:51,638
Aye, aye, master.

772
00:53:52,681 --> 00:53:53,856
Don't you touch me.

773
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:56,624
Hold her still.

774
00:54:00,349 --> 00:54:02,531
Ginger, someone's been
stealing money from the bar.

775
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:03,991
Really?

776
00:54:05,145 --> 00:54:07,052
<i>Don't look at me.
I didn't do nothing.</i>

777
00:54:07,172 --> 00:54:09,057
<i>I'll beat the shit out of you
if you say I did.</i>

778
00:54:09,177 --> 00:54:10,892
<i>It wasn't me that took it.</i>

779
00:54:11,012 --> 00:54:12,505
She didn't do it...

780
00:54:13,472 --> 00:54:15,044
- but she knows who did.
- What?

781
00:54:15,949 --> 00:54:16,965
Fuck you.

782
00:54:17,085 --> 00:54:19,500
<i>Shit. How'd she know?</i>
<i>I didn't tell anyone, I swear.</i>

783
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:22,537
<i>Fuck, he's gonna kill me.</i>

784
00:54:23,608 --> 00:54:25,093
Who? Who's gonna kill you?

785
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:27,098
Ginger, honey, what's his name?

786
00:54:30,135 --> 00:54:31,913
It's blank,
like her memory's been erased.

787
00:54:32,033 --> 00:54:33,813
I don't know anything, I swear.

788
00:54:33,973 --> 00:54:36,030
- She's been glamoured.
- It's a vampire.
