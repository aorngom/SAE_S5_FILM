1
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,242
That's it, baby.

2
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:31,948
"Baby"?

3
00:00:34,385 --> 00:00:36,535
I'm a over a thousand years old.

4
00:00:37,384 --> 00:00:39,037
Are you not having a good time?

5
00:00:40,114 --> 00:00:42,583
There's just not much thrill left
in feeding on the willing.

6
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,287
Then should I try
pretending not to want it?

7
00:00:47,828 --> 00:00:49,378
Only if you are very,

8
00:00:50,194 --> 00:00:52,341
very good at it.

9
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,182
Get off me.

10
00:01:00,081 --> 00:01:02,201
You sick...

11
00:01:03,249 --> 00:01:05,352
bloodsucking bastard.

12
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:15,527
Off you go.

13
00:01:19,647 --> 00:01:21,496
Tell your manager
you were magnificent.

14
00:01:22,084 --> 00:01:24,284
I'll back up your story if he calls.

15
00:01:30,277 --> 00:01:33,632
I was beginning to think you weren't
going to accept my invitation, Lorena.

16
00:01:35,024 --> 00:01:36,433
For a vampire,

17
00:01:37,344 --> 00:01:39,066
you're a terrible liar.

18
00:02:56,927 --> 00:03:01,472
Sync: mpm & Arrow
for the sub factory.

19
00:03:25,628 --> 00:03:27,083
Tell them to go away.

20
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,320
It could be anyone.

21
00:03:33,924 --> 00:03:35,082
Who is there?

22
00:03:35,207 --> 00:03:36,774
Isabel, from the summit.

23
00:03:41,084 --> 00:03:42,209
And who is this?

24
00:03:42,334 --> 00:03:44,088
His name is Hugo.

25
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:46,288
He is mine.

26
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:56,537
I could see how worried you were about
Sookie infiltrating the Fellowship,

27
00:03:56,662 --> 00:03:58,475
and I thought Hugo could help.

28
00:03:58,967 --> 00:04:00,959
And why would you want to help us?

29
00:04:01,153 --> 00:04:03,366
Because Godric is my sheriff,
not yours.

30
00:04:04,653 --> 00:04:07,008
It would be criminal of me
to let you take this risk

31
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:08,921
without my at least offering.

32
00:04:09,402 --> 00:04:11,268
And why would you want to help us?

33
00:04:11,404 --> 00:04:13,294
I would do anything for Isabel.

34
00:04:13,658 --> 00:04:16,217
<i>Forever, and not just my forever,</i>
<i>your forever.</i>

35
00:04:16,342 --> 00:04:17,715
<i>And forever and forever... </i>

36
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:20,801
It's true, he would.

37
00:04:21,633 --> 00:04:22,878
He loves her.

38
00:04:23,232 --> 00:04:25,014
You. He loves you.
Very much.

39
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,220
And I him.

40
00:04:28,847 --> 00:04:30,345
Consider my offer.

41
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,563
If nothing else, with Hugo there,

42
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:35,065
Sookie will be less likely
to arouse suspicion.

43
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,484
People of the church,
they have a way of not

44
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:40,068
trusting a woman
when she's absent a man.

45
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:41,697
Bill, I have to say,

46
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,438
as a woman who's been
absent a man most of her life,

47
00:04:44,563 --> 00:04:46,368
that could not be more true.

48
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,730
I considered booking you
in the room adjoining theirs,

49
00:04:52,855 --> 00:04:54,930
but I thought that might be a bit...

50
00:04:55,283 --> 00:04:56,462
over the top.

51
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:58,871
Why am I here, Mr. Northman?

52
00:04:59,352 --> 00:05:01,050
We want the same thing, you and I.

53
00:05:05,661 --> 00:05:07,306
Bill has something that I want,

54
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:08,867
and he's in the way.

55
00:05:09,603 --> 00:05:10,850
His human?

56
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,727
No, she's something more than human.

57
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,022
What is she?

58
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:17,519
That I do not know,

59
00:05:18,546 --> 00:05:20,040
but whatever she is...

60
00:05:21,414 --> 00:05:22,564
he loves her.

61
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:27,415
What makes you think
I want him back?

62
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,954
That I'd even take him?

63
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,982
Because you didn't come
all this way just to see me.

64
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:40,925
I haven't seen Bill Compton
in over 70 years.

65
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,050
Surely you can't think I have
any pull over him whatsoever.

66
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:47,051
I haven't seen my maker
for much longer than that,

67
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:49,838
and yet I am still loyal to him.

68
00:05:50,804 --> 00:05:52,101
Fiercely loyal.

69
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:55,229
Shame I didn't turn you.

70
00:05:57,275 --> 00:05:58,306
Then again,

71
00:06:00,618 --> 00:06:02,583
you're not really my type.

72
00:06:50,503 --> 00:06:52,566
Enjoying the entertainment?

73
00:06:53,989 --> 00:06:56,263
- Very much.
- Yes. He's wonderful.

74
00:06:56,555 --> 00:06:57,541
Just wonderful.

75
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,880
He is.

76
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,173
Quite wonderful.

77
00:07:05,734 --> 00:07:07,660
I love your necklace,

78
00:07:08,403 --> 00:07:09,594
it's extraordinary.

79
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:10,882
Thank you.

80
00:07:11,007 --> 00:07:13,695
I love it too.
It was a gift from Sydney.

81
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,029
Yeah, it cost me
a pretty penny, but...

82
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,229
got me out of a whopper of a fight.
Right, doll?

83
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,953
Where'd you say you two were all...

84
00:07:24,078 --> 00:07:26,044
from again, Miss...?

85
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:27,195
Olivier.

86
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:28,700
Faviana Olivier.

87
00:07:28,825 --> 00:07:31,292
And we are from Europe. France.

88
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,161
I'm hoping to hop over the pond
some time soon,

89
00:07:34,286 --> 00:07:36,789
- take this one with me.
- I've always wanted to see Europe.

90
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,511
You would like it.

91
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:42,293
And it would certainly like you.

92
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,993
You seem

93
00:07:46,588 --> 00:07:48,509
European already.

94
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:52,421
Most Americans these days are so...

95
00:07:53,112 --> 00:07:54,098
puritanical.

96
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:57,143
Fuck prohibition.

97
00:07:58,709 --> 00:07:59,977
He's so crass.

98
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,446
But he is right.

99
00:08:01,688 --> 00:08:03,066
Fuck prohibition.

100
00:08:13,386 --> 00:08:14,586
If you'd like,

101
00:08:15,171 --> 00:08:17,171
after your other guests leave,

102
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,851
Guillaume and I could stay
and we could all

103
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:23,999
fuck prohibition

104
00:08:24,124 --> 00:08:25,586
somewhat further.

105
00:08:28,468 --> 00:08:29,518
Absolutely.

106
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,827
I am Guillaume.

107
00:09:40,782 --> 00:09:42,232
What happened here?

108
00:09:44,094 --> 00:09:46,494
Baby,
if you don't want to tell me...

109
00:09:47,651 --> 00:09:48,932
It's all right...

110
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:53,658
When I take my clothes off,
it's all anybody ever sees.

111
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,643
The answer is...
I don't know what happened.

112
00:10:00,435 --> 00:10:03,249
- You mean, you don't remember-
- I remember.

113
00:10:03,374 --> 00:10:05,079
Heck, I'll never forget it.

114
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:08,497
I just never got a look at who,

115
00:10:08,752 --> 00:10:10,776
or what, it was that jumped me.

116
00:10:11,813 --> 00:10:12,813
Jesus.

117
00:10:13,327 --> 00:10:14,279
Where were you?

118
00:10:14,689 --> 00:10:15,753
In the woods.

119
00:10:15,878 --> 00:10:16,878
Running.

120
00:10:17,691 --> 00:10:19,718
And then whatever it was,

121
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,930
it was on me.

122
00:10:22,754 --> 00:10:23,913
It slashed me.

123
00:10:24,504 --> 00:10:27,029
And then I was sick,
real sick, for weeks.

124
00:10:27,313 --> 00:10:29,240
The doctors couldn't figure it out.

125
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:30,855
What it was.

126
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,492
They told me I was lucky to be alive

127
00:10:35,007 --> 00:10:36,923
and I should count my blessings.

128
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,766
And I still do,
every single day of my life.

129
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:43,509
You're

130
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,210
the most amazing person

131
00:10:48,572 --> 00:10:49,939
I've ever met.

132
00:10:51,844 --> 00:10:54,861
You're just saying that because I'm
the first honest sex you've ever had.

133
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,530
No, that's not true.

134
00:10:59,824 --> 00:11:02,483
Have you told
anybody else what you are?

135
00:11:08,354 --> 00:11:10,537
My friend Sookie.
She knows.

136
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:14,985
And have you slept with her?

137
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,262
I rest my case.

138
00:11:26,939 --> 00:11:28,769
Seriously, though, Sam.

139
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:30,855
You shouldn't be ashamed
of what you are.

140
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,324
I'm not ashamed.

141
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,111
- I just don't go around advertising it.
- Well, neither do I,

142
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,012
but the people that I know,

143
00:11:38,453 --> 00:11:41,282
the people that I love,
I don't keep it a secret from them.

144
00:11:43,992 --> 00:11:45,292
How come you do?

145
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,065
I guess it's because
it's dangerous out there.

146
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:53,420
It's, like, why take the risk?

147
00:11:56,087 --> 00:11:59,675
Because not taking the risk
is riskier.

148
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,679
That's just wordplay.

149
00:12:05,276 --> 00:12:07,207
No. No, it's not.

150
00:12:09,153 --> 00:12:10,580
The way I look at it,

151
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,846
if you're gonna take the danger
out of getting to know someone,

152
00:12:13,971 --> 00:12:15,859
you might as well not bother
with 'em at all.

153
00:12:16,592 --> 00:12:19,275
You got to share
this life with people.

154
00:12:22,058 --> 00:12:24,451
It's what we were put on this
big ol' round ball to do.

155
00:12:24,971 --> 00:12:25,952
And people,

156
00:12:26,181 --> 00:12:27,683
they need to know you.

157
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:34,565
You're just too damned
special for 'em not to.

158
00:12:36,492 --> 00:12:38,340
Where the fuck did you come from?

159
00:12:50,513 --> 00:12:53,854
I'm looking for a pump
for an A.O. Smith water heater.

160
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,323
<i>Can you hold on?</i>

161
00:12:55,852 --> 00:12:57,071
Yeah, I'll hold.

162
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,683
Shit.

163
00:12:58,808 --> 00:13:00,903
Want me to take a look
and you can hold the line?

164
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:04,324
That was some spiteful shit,
what you said right there. I got this.

165
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:06,092
I am the man of the house.

166
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,328
- No offense, Karl.
- None taken.

167
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:11,039
How's your coffee?

168
00:13:12,153 --> 00:13:14,822
Colder than that ridiculous
excuse for a shower.

169
00:13:15,771 --> 00:13:17,130
I don't know what to tell you.

170
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:20,132
I wish I had a fancier crib
for you to squat in, but I don't.

171
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:24,610
You may not know this about me,

172
00:13:24,735 --> 00:13:26,797
but without a hot shower
in the morning,

173
00:13:26,922 --> 00:13:29,255
I have no tolerance for sarcasm.

174
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:31,172
- Sorry.
- <i>You still there?</i>

175
00:13:31,297 --> 00:13:32,477
Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

176
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,146
- <i>Yeah, we got one.</i>
- You do?

177
00:13:34,552 --> 00:13:35,439
Great.

178
00:13:35,608 --> 00:13:37,361
We'll be there as soon as we can.

179
00:13:37,486 --> 00:13:39,549
Hardware shop in Ferriday's
got the part we need.

180
00:13:39,675 --> 00:13:42,604
Ferriday is over two hours away.

181
00:13:42,729 --> 00:13:44,364
It's an old water heater, Maryann,

182
00:13:44,489 --> 00:13:46,927
and I called everyone I could
within 150 mile radius,

183
00:13:47,052 --> 00:13:49,910
and this guy is the only one who's got
a recirculating pump that'll fit it.

184
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,246
So do you want somebody
to go get it or not?

185
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,428
Drive like the wind.

186
00:13:57,929 --> 00:13:59,963
- Maybe Eggs ought to come-?
- No, I want him here

187
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:01,590
working on the water heater.

188
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,266
See if he can jury-rigsometh
take some semblance of a shower

189
00:14:04,391 --> 00:14:05,677
before you get back.

190
00:14:05,868 --> 00:14:08,512
Maryann, I think
you're overestimating your plumber.

191
00:14:09,222 --> 00:14:11,725
Besides, if I have to drive a car
and look at a map at the same time,

192
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,226
I'll crash your Jag.

193
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:14,790
I know I will.

194
00:14:20,246 --> 00:14:21,818
You can go.
Go, go!

195
00:14:31,655 --> 00:14:33,561
Where you been,
we're 10 minutes late.

196
00:14:33,686 --> 00:14:36,312
Didn't they say what they
wanted to see us for?

197
00:14:36,437 --> 00:14:39,779
All they said was to grab you and get
our butts down to the sanctuary lawn.

198
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:43,373
- Why, you think it's something bad?
- It can't be good.

199
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:47,594
Good morning.

200
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,131
Think you can handle it?

201
00:14:54,758 --> 00:14:56,278
It's just a...

202
00:14:56,664 --> 00:14:59,083
Well, it's a platform
with a cross on top of it.

203
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:02,310
- Seems pretty straightforward.
- Good. Good, good.

204
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:04,641
Look, I'm sorry,
but the rest of the group...

205
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:06,756
They're back at camp,
training, right?

206
00:15:06,881 --> 00:15:08,489
Shouldn't we be with them?

207
00:15:10,445 --> 00:15:12,827
I mean, we ain't being punished
for something, are we?

208
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,332
Jason Stackhouse, of all the things.

209
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,764
Now, what would we
be punishing you for?

210
00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:23,255
Nothing.

211
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,714
Nothing at all.

212
00:15:25,073 --> 00:15:27,299
Well, then, how about you stop sulking
and try to be

213
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,511
thankful for the job
you've been given?

214
00:15:30,247 --> 00:15:33,313
I shouldn't have to remind you,
but Jesus was a carpenter.

215
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,849
Oh, my golly.

216
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,893
I didn't even think
about the parallels.

217
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,065
- Should we tell them?
- I'm not sure that's such a good...

218
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:44,734
They're the best of the best,
they deserve to know.

219
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:47,279
Now, can you boys keep a secret?

220
00:15:47,641 --> 00:15:49,829
- I hope so, yeah.
- I'll take it to the grave.

221
00:15:49,954 --> 00:15:51,893
This platform
we're having you build?

222
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,518
It's for a ceremony.

223
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,330
Have either of you ever heard
the expression,

224
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,580
"Meet the Sun"?

225
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,214
Are you for real?

226
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,184
Sarah, I'm talking.

227
00:16:04,395 --> 00:16:06,320
Luke, you want to do the honors?

228
00:16:09,147 --> 00:16:11,594
Well, if it's what I read
about on the Internet,

229
00:16:11,982 --> 00:16:13,713
meeting the sun is
when you take a vampire

230
00:16:13,838 --> 00:16:15,599
and you chain him to the cross
before dawn.

231
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,571
And when the sun comes up,

232
00:16:17,696 --> 00:16:19,644
the congregation gets to watch
from the bleachers

233
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,153
as the vampire ignites
and is sent to his fiery grave

234
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:23,273
once and for all.

235
00:16:25,146 --> 00:16:26,234
Jesus Christ.

236
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,695
Well, yes, him, but the sun too.

237
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:31,765
Get to work, boys.

238
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,783
- You should probably wear this.
- Oh, Hugo.

239
00:16:37,132 --> 00:16:38,778
Yes, a thousand times yes.

240
00:16:38,903 --> 00:16:39,953
And also...

241
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:42,753
Just so that they believe we're
a couple about to get married,

242
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:45,557
it'd probably be best if you
let me do most of the talking.

243
00:16:46,718 --> 00:16:49,007
I'll just shut up and look pretty.

244
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:51,509
- That's not what I meant.
- Yeah, it was.

245
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,231
It's okay. It'll be easier
for me to listen in on others

246
00:16:54,356 --> 00:16:57,033
if I don't have to worry about
carrying on a conversation.

247
00:16:57,158 --> 00:16:58,208
Good, good.

248
00:16:58,594 --> 00:17:00,649
But if they do ask you any questions,
are you sure

249
00:17:00,774 --> 00:17:03,169
you're going to be able to say the kinds
of things about vampires

250
00:17:03,294 --> 00:17:05,679
- that they're going to want to hear?
- Hugo,

251
00:17:05,804 --> 00:17:08,036
I don't just hear
the things hateful people say.

252
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:10,306
I hear the things
that are so hateful

253
00:17:10,431 --> 00:17:12,947
that hateful people don't even
want to say them out loud.

254
00:17:13,725 --> 00:17:16,661
Don't you worry about me.
I got plenty of material to work with.

255
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:17,786
I'll be fine.

256
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:18,911
Good.

257
00:17:19,756 --> 00:17:22,221
It's funny,
I don't even know you really,

258
00:17:22,346 --> 00:17:25,460
but you're the only other person
I've ever met who's dated a vampire...

259
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,081
What do you want to know?

260
00:17:29,073 --> 00:17:30,048
Everything.

261
00:17:33,091 --> 00:17:34,594
Do you and Isabel ever fight?

262
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:35,887
We fight like crazy.

263
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:39,108
But I've been with women
I didn't fight with before,

264
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:41,222
and with every one of them,
I found that the reason

265
00:17:41,347 --> 00:17:44,229
that we never fought was because
I didn't care enough to bother.

266
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:48,274
Oh, Hugo, that is messed up.

267
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,542
Well, maybe.

268
00:17:49,983 --> 00:17:51,356
But it's also true.

269
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:54,281
It's funny, but whenever
Bill and me fight,

270
00:17:54,545 --> 00:17:57,233
even as I'm screaming and I'm so mad

271
00:17:57,358 --> 00:17:59,577
I don't think I'm ever
going to stop,

272
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,975
somehow, in the middle of all that,

273
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,859
I know that we're both fighting
for our relationship.

274
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:06,234
For each other.

275
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:08,460
We're fighting to stay together.

276
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:09,673
Do you...

277
00:18:11,015 --> 00:18:11,880
Never mind.

278
00:18:12,362 --> 00:18:13,362
What?

279
00:18:14,925 --> 00:18:15,925
Lately...

280
00:18:16,622 --> 00:18:18,763
the thing Isabel and I
have been fighting about the most

281
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,350
is whenever I bring up the subject
of her turning me,

282
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,810
she just shuts down.
She won't even discuss it.

283
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,178
Is that a thing that people
actually do?

284
00:18:28,303 --> 00:18:30,024
Because it's never
even occurred to me.

285
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:31,338
How could it not?

286
00:18:31,709 --> 00:18:33,285
Right now it's all well and good,

287
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,861
but in 50 years when they're
still what they are,

288
00:18:35,986 --> 00:18:37,866
but we're in our '70s and '80s

289
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,744
and we're hunched over
and frail and using walkers?

290
00:18:41,182 --> 00:18:43,747
Come on.
How could they still love us?

291
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,320
We should go.

292
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,923
Listen, I'm so sorry.
I shouldn't have told you that...

293
00:18:56,048 --> 00:18:57,135
It's okay. Really.

294
00:18:57,872 --> 00:19:01,187
Besides, now if I die today,
who cares?

295
00:19:01,312 --> 00:19:05,062
At least I'll never have to feel old,
and unloved, and unwanted.

296
00:19:13,746 --> 00:19:15,555
Bitches, don't you know

297
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,323
that sarcasm and cold water

298
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:19,918
do not mix?

299
00:19:23,418 --> 00:19:24,418
All right,

300
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:28,749
so next thing you want to do is hop
on the 165 South.

301
00:19:29,226 --> 00:19:30,226
Excellent.

302
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,545
You're a hell of a navigator.

303
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,646
There's going to be a diner

304
00:19:50,085 --> 00:19:52,774
that's built out of an old red barn
coming from around the next bend.

305
00:19:53,743 --> 00:19:56,152
- You been here before?
- No. Never.

306
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,864
Why the fuck did I know that?

307
00:20:00,137 --> 00:20:02,915
All right, you're freaking me out.
You better not be fucking with me.

308
00:20:03,657 --> 00:20:05,716
- Turn right here.
- Eggs, tell me what's going on.

309
00:20:05,841 --> 00:20:08,218
Tara, I don't know.
Please, just turn right here.

310
00:20:08,343 --> 00:20:09,499
- Come on.
- Shit.

311
00:20:44,414 --> 00:20:46,011
Where you going, Eggs?

312
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:56,733
You still up for doing
something after work tonight?

313
00:20:57,763 --> 00:20:58,540
Sure.

314
00:20:58,665 --> 00:21:00,856
Good, because I just
got off the phone,

315
00:21:00,981 --> 00:21:04,430
and I got a surprise
lined up for you.

316
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:08,372
I don't like surprises, Arlene.

317
00:21:08,705 --> 00:21:10,295
Well, that's too bad,

318
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,353
because I just happen to be

319
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,691
an extremely mysterious woman.

320
00:21:19,338 --> 00:21:20,820
Can I get y'all anything else?

321
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,088
How about the iced tea I ordered
over five minutes ago?

322
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,078
Oh, my gosh, I am so sorry.

323
00:21:25,198 --> 00:21:27,456
- I'll be right back with that.
- And some Worcester?

324
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,672
- Any chance I'll get it?
- Zero.

325
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,961
She's about the worst
I've ever seen.

326
00:21:35,081 --> 00:21:36,383
Maybe it's for the best.

327
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,926
Lately if you're too good a waitress
around here,

328
00:21:39,086 --> 00:21:40,802
someone's gonna come along
and kill you.

329
00:21:40,962 --> 00:21:43,472
You are so bad, Maxine.

330
00:21:46,685 --> 00:21:48,835
Hey, there, Sam.
Lafayette here?

331
00:21:48,955 --> 00:21:50,205
In the kitchen.

332
00:21:54,297 --> 00:21:57,361
I've been noticing some strange
things about you lately.

333
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:58,965
Like?

334
00:21:59,481 --> 00:22:02,289
Like the fact that you just up
and vanish for over two weeks,

335
00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:04,395
and like the fact that
now that you are back,

336
00:22:04,515 --> 00:22:06,578
you seem to have lost
some of your pizzazz.

337
00:22:08,626 --> 00:22:09,623
My pizzazz?

338
00:22:09,783 --> 00:22:10,749
That's right.

339
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,435
Now, in case you didn't hear,

340
00:22:14,555 --> 00:22:16,463
Lafayette, a woman's dead.

341
00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:20,217
Woman just so happened to have
ripped of your cousin and your auntie.

342
00:22:20,903 --> 00:22:22,094
So for the record,

343
00:22:23,238 --> 00:22:24,638
where were you?

344
00:22:26,241 --> 00:22:27,891
I was on a cruise.

345
00:22:28,437 --> 00:22:29,406
A cruise, huh?

346
00:22:29,526 --> 00:22:30,602
What kind?

347
00:22:30,762 --> 00:22:31,762
A gay one.

348
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,439
Why don't you tell me

349
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,401
- what you're accusing me...
- You weren't on any gay cruise,

350
00:22:38,185 --> 00:22:39,152
if you were,

351
00:22:39,312 --> 00:22:41,613
you would have come back
with more pizzazz, not less.

352
00:22:42,331 --> 00:22:44,839
So how about you and I go down
to the station, I lock you up.

353
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,703
Leave you in a cell to rot

354
00:22:47,863 --> 00:22:49,263
until you confess,

355
00:22:50,186 --> 00:22:51,915
or you can just tell me now.

356
00:22:53,966 --> 00:22:56,044
I already know what you were doing.

357
00:22:56,226 --> 00:22:57,504
You were hiding out.

358
00:22:57,664 --> 00:22:58,864
Lying in wait.

359
00:22:58,984 --> 00:23:01,678
You killed that woman
and cut her heart out.

360
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,553
Now, tell me I'm not right.

361
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,638
Leave him alone, cuz.

362
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:08,640
Terry, you need to shut up.

363
00:23:09,051 --> 00:23:10,422
And you need to get up.

364
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:12,929
Think I will take you
down to the station.

365
00:23:13,274 --> 00:23:14,924
I said get the fuck up!

366
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:17,649
What the hell, Andy?

367
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:19,283
Back when we were kids playing

368
00:23:19,403 --> 00:23:22,100
cops and robbers in Me-maw
and Pa-po's backyard,

369
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:24,906
you always used to make
your arrests with dignity.

370
00:23:26,077 --> 00:23:28,451
This ain't the kind of cop
you set out to be.

371
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,747
And by the way, everybody knows
that you ain't even a cop anymore.

372
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:36,291
Get the hell out of here.

373
00:23:37,579 --> 00:23:39,379
- But he's a suspect.
- No,

374
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:40,589
he ain't.

375
00:23:41,481 --> 00:23:44,436
And even if he was, does he look
like he's about to run, to you?

376
00:23:48,473 --> 00:23:49,895
All right, you're right.

377
00:23:54,052 --> 00:23:55,353
I'm sorry, Mr. Reynolds.

378
00:24:04,917 --> 00:24:06,017
Okay, buddy.

379
00:24:09,926 --> 00:24:10,926
Come here.

380
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:12,666
Come here.

381
00:24:13,696 --> 00:24:14,696
Come here.

382
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,461
Close your eyes.

383
00:24:20,141 --> 00:24:21,141
Close 'em.

384
00:24:22,143 --> 00:24:23,143
Close 'em.

385
00:24:24,108 --> 00:24:25,208
That's good.

386
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:28,801
Now, I want you

387
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:30,561
to imagine

388
00:24:31,892 --> 00:24:33,442
a golden glowing ball

389
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,530
radiating warmth

390
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,420
and safety.

391
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,259
That's good.

392
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:53,758
Activation required.

393
00:24:55,524 --> 00:24:57,541
You remember Bonita Lou Morris.

394
00:24:57,701 --> 00:24:59,373
Nice to see you again, Miss Morris.

395
00:24:59,647 --> 00:25:01,843
I paid that bill last week.
I want to know why my phone

396
00:25:01,963 --> 00:25:03,797
is telling me "activation required".

397
00:25:03,957 --> 00:25:06,007
Because I canceled it.

398
00:25:07,026 --> 00:25:08,093
Goddang it, Mama.

399
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:12,430
Now Jessica's gonna think I'm
like those guys that never text back.

400
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,390
Good.

401
00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:14,891
Girls who call boys

402
00:25:15,051 --> 00:25:18,854
at all hours of the night like that
are looking for one thing: money.

403
00:25:19,014 --> 00:25:20,272
We don't have any money.

404
00:25:20,494 --> 00:25:21,794
That's not true.

405
00:25:22,228 --> 00:25:23,859
We're very comfortable.

406
00:25:24,976 --> 00:25:25,861
I told you

407
00:25:26,074 --> 00:25:28,439
I would let you date a girl like that
over my dead body,

408
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,573
and I meant it.

409
00:25:29,693 --> 00:25:31,324
This is only the first step.

410
00:25:34,588 --> 00:25:35,738
Reactivate it

411
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:38,233
or the next step's
gonna be all mine.

412
00:25:40,076 --> 00:25:42,526
And one last thing
about my girlfriend

413
00:25:42,824 --> 00:25:44,675
that I think both
of y'all need to know.

414
00:25:45,165 --> 00:25:48,925
The reason that Jessica calls me
all late like she does

415
00:25:50,962 --> 00:25:52,637
is that she's a vampire.

416
00:26:10,243 --> 00:26:11,393
I can't work.

417
00:26:11,996 --> 00:26:13,296
And why is that?

418
00:26:13,996 --> 00:26:15,629
Because,
when I look at that pool table,

419
00:26:15,749 --> 00:26:19,068
I keep seeing you on it, and then
I can't think about anything else.

420
00:26:19,188 --> 00:26:21,001
What do you say we get outta here?

421
00:26:21,236 --> 00:26:22,386
And go where?

422
00:26:23,151 --> 00:26:25,552
Well, we'll sneak out the back
and shift

423
00:26:26,189 --> 00:26:27,539
and run and play.

424
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:29,866
Do it out under the sun.

425
00:26:31,045 --> 00:26:32,923
I would love to, but if I left work,

426
00:26:33,043 --> 00:26:34,726
my boss would kill me.

427
00:26:35,801 --> 00:26:38,323
Don't you go and slap me
with a harassment suit for this,

428
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:40,439
but if you don't go
out back right now

429
00:26:40,678 --> 00:26:42,349
and take off all your clothes,

430
00:26:42,515 --> 00:26:43,815
I will fire you.

431
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:46,436
Well, we wouldn't want that.

432
00:26:46,657 --> 00:26:47,957
No, we wouldn't.

433
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,302
I'll meet you out back in two.

434
00:26:52,422 --> 00:26:53,522
Make it one.

435
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:04,466
<i>Big ol'scary vampire
Went up...</i>

436
00:27:07,172 --> 00:27:09,047
Help me out, Stackhouse.
What should go there?

437
00:27:10,646 --> 00:27:12,756
- God, son of a...
- You all right?

438
00:27:13,253 --> 00:27:14,509
I'm fine. Just...

439
00:27:15,263 --> 00:27:16,179
Stupid.

440
00:27:16,393 --> 00:27:19,448
No, you're just preoccupied.
So come on now, out with it.

441
00:27:19,568 --> 00:27:22,528
And I hope I don't have to remind you
you're wearing your ring of honesty.

442
00:27:23,025 --> 00:27:25,124
Yeah, I don't know, man.
I just...

443
00:27:28,214 --> 00:27:31,014
Remember what you said
the other day about...

444
00:27:31,707 --> 00:27:33,557
me only being sent up on...

445
00:27:33,806 --> 00:27:35,666
On account of Sarah wanting my...

446
00:27:36,163 --> 00:27:37,075
My johnson?

447
00:27:37,235 --> 00:27:39,485
Man, that's just me being jealous.

448
00:27:39,808 --> 00:27:43,047
Even as it was coming out of my mouth,
I knew God was frowning on me.

449
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:46,311
Because not only do you deserve
everything coming your way, but Sarah,

450
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:49,901
if she ain't the holiest person I know,
then I don't know who is.

451
00:27:53,362 --> 00:27:55,323
The day that we met, you said...

452
00:27:55,627 --> 00:27:58,436
You said that you'd been abstinent
for the last three years.

453
00:27:58,809 --> 00:27:59,848
That's right.

454
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:02,892
How come?

455
00:28:03,052 --> 00:28:04,769
Because sex outside
of marriage is a sin.

456
00:28:05,962 --> 00:28:08,419
- You really believe that?
- It ain't what I believe.

457
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:10,062
It's what God believes,

458
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:14,273
but some sins
are bigger than others.

459
00:28:14,671 --> 00:28:15,671
Like what?

460
00:28:16,148 --> 00:28:17,754
You're gonna do it out of wedlock,

461
00:28:17,874 --> 00:28:20,636
gotta make sure the girl you
do it to ain't married either.

462
00:28:21,735 --> 00:28:23,735
Right, because adultery's bad.

463
00:28:24,055 --> 00:28:25,332
One of the worst.

464
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,293
Right up there with incest
and bestiality.

465
00:28:29,153 --> 00:28:30,259
What the f...

466
00:28:30,379 --> 00:28:32,400
But all of 'em put together
ain't half as bad

467
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,155
as if you do it to a vampire.

468
00:28:35,163 --> 00:28:36,092
Or to a dude.

469
00:28:37,844 --> 00:28:40,868
Or a vampire dude, and that's
like <i>crème de la crème</i> of sins.

470
00:28:40,988 --> 00:28:42,432
Ain't no repentance for that.

471
00:28:43,607 --> 00:28:44,987
Straight to hell, baby.

472
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:47,604
But everything else
you can repent from.

473
00:28:48,709 --> 00:28:50,225
Sure. God's a...

474
00:28:50,988 --> 00:28:52,548
He's an open-minded guy.

475
00:28:53,058 --> 00:28:54,108
To a point.

476
00:28:56,304 --> 00:28:57,850
Jason Stackhouse,

477
00:28:58,416 --> 00:28:59,366
abstinent.

478
00:29:00,686 --> 00:29:02,164
Sounds good, don't it?

479
00:29:03,034 --> 00:29:04,084
Not really.

480
00:29:08,475 --> 00:29:10,126
Went to the sun to fry.

481
00:29:11,638 --> 00:29:12,462
What?

482
00:29:12,726 --> 00:29:16,522
<i>The big ol'scary vampire
Went to the sun to fry</i>

483
00:29:17,811 --> 00:29:19,219
That is awesome.

484
00:29:19,951 --> 00:29:21,346
Be here all day.

485
00:29:24,676 --> 00:29:26,326
Why do I recognize her?

486
00:29:26,553 --> 00:29:28,872
Because she's on TV all the time.
That's Sarah Newlin.

487
00:29:28,992 --> 00:29:30,438
She's the reverend's wife.

488
00:29:31,026 --> 00:29:32,200
Oh, right.

489
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:35,735
You know, in person,
she looks like vanilla pudding.

490
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:42,826
Hi, there.

491
00:29:42,986 --> 00:29:45,954
Happened to be looking out the window
as you were driving up, and I thought

492
00:29:46,114 --> 00:29:48,039
I'd come on out
and greet you myself.

493
00:29:48,199 --> 00:29:49,791
I'm Sarah Newlin.
And you all are?

494
00:29:49,951 --> 00:29:51,833
Hi. Holly Simpson.
I'm...

495
00:29:51,953 --> 00:29:53,939
I cannot believe
I'm meeting you in person.

496
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:55,338
You are cute as a button.

497
00:29:55,687 --> 00:29:59,143
Thank you, Holly. And you're like
a cool breeze on a hot summer day.

498
00:29:59,263 --> 00:30:00,510
- Quit.
- And you are?

499
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,870
- I'm...
- Silly me. This is Rufus Dobson,

500
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:05,417
my <i>fiancé.</i>
I love saying that word.

501
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,806
In fact,
sometimes I love it so much,

502
00:30:08,092 --> 00:30:11,020
I don't even want to get married,
just so I can keep on calling him it.

503
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,189
But we're going to.

504
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:14,901
Get married, that is.

505
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:17,079
Which is why we're
looking for a church.

506
00:30:17,604 --> 00:30:19,529
Excellence. And I'm pleased
to meet you, Rufus.

507
00:30:19,689 --> 00:30:20,738
It's an honor.

508
00:30:20,898 --> 00:30:22,240
The honor's mine.

509
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,990
How about you all follow me in

510
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,817
and we'll see if Steve is available.

511
00:30:25,937 --> 00:30:27,772
I'm sure he'd love to meet you both.

512
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:28,892
For real?

513
00:30:29,012 --> 00:30:31,459
Reverend Newlin himself?
Oh, that would be just super.

514
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,779
Well, come on.

515
00:30:35,565 --> 00:30:37,222
I thought I would do the talking.

516
00:30:37,342 --> 00:30:39,915
When I get nervous,
sometimes I talk too much.

517
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,343
Funny thing is,

518
00:30:43,047 --> 00:30:45,537
Rufus and I actually met in church,

519
00:30:45,657 --> 00:30:47,724
but we both left,

520
00:30:47,884 --> 00:30:51,106
like, a month later when
we realized that our pastor was...

521
00:30:51,811 --> 00:30:52,979
a little iffy.

522
00:30:53,139 --> 00:30:54,689
He was a homosexual.

523
00:30:54,849 --> 00:30:56,441
We don't know.
He might have been,

524
00:30:56,601 --> 00:30:58,826
but what became all
too clear was that...

525
00:31:00,797 --> 00:31:01,797
he was...

526
00:31:02,537 --> 00:31:03,794
a sympathizer.

527
00:31:04,491 --> 00:31:05,867
That really ticks me off.

528
00:31:06,027 --> 00:31:08,460
I mean, how can you claim
to be a God-loving person

529
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,538
and then love something
that God detests?

530
00:31:10,698 --> 00:31:11,748
It's upsetting.

531
00:31:11,908 --> 00:31:13,791
It is. It is upsetting,

532
00:31:13,951 --> 00:31:16,421
but that's why my <i>fiancée</i>
and I are here.

533
00:31:17,092 --> 00:31:18,922
We want to make this our new home.

534
00:31:19,318 --> 00:31:22,181
We are thrilled
that you've chosen us.

535
00:31:22,705 --> 00:31:24,302
<i>Wonder how that platform's coming.</i>

536
00:31:24,493 --> 00:31:27,701
<i>I can't wait to bring
that vampire up from the basement</i>

537
00:31:27,821 --> 00:31:29,506
<i>and watch the sun do him the justice</i>

538
00:31:29,626 --> 00:31:32,244
<i>that 2000 years of living couldn't.</i>

539
00:31:33,162 --> 00:31:36,189
It'll be amazing to finally
be amongst like-minded people.

540
00:31:36,998 --> 00:31:38,608
I don't care what anyone says

541
00:31:38,768 --> 00:31:41,277
about vampires being able
to control themselves.

542
00:31:41,437 --> 00:31:42,494
I know better.

543
00:31:42,614 --> 00:31:44,509
I know that every single one of them

544
00:31:44,629 --> 00:31:46,925
is a vicious, bloodthirsty killer.

545
00:31:59,953 --> 00:32:01,603
You have a lovely home.

546
00:32:02,515 --> 00:32:03,399
Thank you.

547
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,885
You're we-we-we-welcome.
We'll enjoy living in it.

548
00:32:06,573 --> 00:32:08,054
Put him in the armchair.

549
00:32:08,553 --> 00:32:10,807
Face it toward the bed
so he can watch.

550
00:32:13,408 --> 00:32:14,477
What? Watch what?

551
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:31,786
Say <i>"au revoir."</i>

552
00:32:32,392 --> 00:32:33,392
Say it!

553
00:32:33,656 --> 00:32:34,656
<i>Au revoir.</i>

554
00:32:35,158 --> 00:32:36,708
Why are you doing this?

555
00:32:37,295 --> 00:32:38,418
Because we can.

556
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,359
Wait.

557
00:33:14,655 --> 00:33:15,705
What is it?

558
00:33:27,815 --> 00:33:29,469
I want you to have this.

559
00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:36,209
You are so thoughtful

560
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,026
and generous.

561
00:33:41,238 --> 00:33:42,690
I love you, William Compton.

562
00:34:17,726 --> 00:34:19,466
We've been walking for over
45 minutes,

563
00:34:19,586 --> 00:34:21,673
and you still haven't told me
where we're going.

564
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,407
- I did. I said I don't know.
- "I don't know" ain't a place.

565
00:34:24,527 --> 00:34:27,610
It's a state of mind
I don't like being in.

566
00:34:29,826 --> 00:34:31,026
What the fuck?

567
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,377
I've been here before.

568
00:34:44,537 --> 00:34:46,467
- I thought you said...
- I know what I said...

569
00:34:46,587 --> 00:34:48,423
so I guess I haven't, but I have.

570
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:49,583
I don't...

571
00:34:56,411 --> 00:34:59,100
Now, something happened here.
Something horrible happened.

572
00:34:59,293 --> 00:35:01,769
- That's pretty fucking obvious.
- You think this is funny?

573
00:35:01,929 --> 00:35:04,640
No, but it don't make any sense,
and when shit don't make sense,

574
00:35:04,807 --> 00:35:08,539
it means there's a logical explanation
you just haven't thought of yet.

575
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:12,059
Maybe it's from when you were a kid.
Maybe somebody brought you here.

576
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:15,473
I... Tara, I grew up
in foster homes in Memphis,

577
00:35:15,593 --> 00:35:17,206
and when you grow up like that,

578
00:35:17,326 --> 00:35:19,579
people ain't trying to take you
on fucking vacations.

579
00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:22,416
Now, I know one thing.
I've been here before.

580
00:35:22,536 --> 00:35:24,036
I just don't even...

581
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:39,596
Shit.

582
00:35:40,127 --> 00:35:41,327
Is that blood?

583
00:35:42,803 --> 00:35:45,597
We must have walked
a mile and a half, maybe two miles,

584
00:35:45,717 --> 00:35:48,760
and I had no idea
where we were going...

585
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:53,321
but then we end up

586
00:35:54,307 --> 00:35:55,823
right here looking at this?

587
00:35:57,777 --> 00:35:59,619
This ain't no fucking coincidence.

588
00:36:09,366 --> 00:36:11,141
Come on, let's get you home.

589
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:12,686
Take it slow.

590
00:36:17,956 --> 00:36:19,106
See you soon.

591
00:36:21,945 --> 00:36:22,892
Careful now.

592
00:36:23,341 --> 00:36:24,341
Careful?

593
00:36:24,579 --> 00:36:25,394
About what?

594
00:36:25,554 --> 00:36:28,372
Sometimes when we open these doors,

595
00:36:28,492 --> 00:36:31,811
so much love comes flowing out
that it'll knock you down

596
00:36:32,103 --> 00:36:34,733
- if you're not ready for it.
- We'll be sure to brace ourselves.

597
00:36:43,092 --> 00:36:44,192
Oh, my gosh.

598
00:36:44,688 --> 00:36:45,688
I know.

599
00:36:45,902 --> 00:36:47,427
I just love it in here.

600
00:36:47,547 --> 00:36:49,687
The way it glows like it does.

601
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,072
Particularly in the late afternoon.

602
00:36:52,663 --> 00:36:54,048
It's inspiring, isn't it?

603
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:55,258
It really is.

604
00:36:55,418 --> 00:36:58,010
Yessirree.
This is where we're getting married.

605
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:00,429
I can't wait to see you
walk down this aisle.

606
00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:01,589
Me either.

607
00:37:02,216 --> 00:37:04,141
Have either of you
ever been to a lock-in?

608
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:05,590
A lock-in?

609
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,578
<i>Course she hasn't.
She's no Christian.</i>

610
00:37:07,698 --> 00:37:09,105
Oh, yeah, it's loads of fun.

611
00:37:09,265 --> 00:37:11,072
Everybody brings
their sleeping bags...

612
00:37:11,192 --> 00:37:12,782
<i>Don't bring the girl into this.</i>

613
00:37:12,902 --> 00:37:14,986
<i>Probably so scared,
she doesn't want to do this.</i>

614
00:37:15,146 --> 00:37:16,762
<i>Those vampires made her do it.</i>

615
00:37:17,418 --> 00:37:18,804
<i>They say she can hear me.</i>

616
00:37:18,924 --> 00:37:21,258
<i>I wonder if that fang-loving freak
can hear me right now.</i>

617
00:37:21,378 --> 00:37:22,618
<i>She don't look normal.</i>

618
00:37:23,591 --> 00:37:25,836
That lock-in does sound like fun.

619
00:37:26,406 --> 00:37:28,374
We gotta go home
and get our sleeping bags now.

620
00:37:28,534 --> 00:37:30,078
But the tour's not even over yet.

621
00:37:30,198 --> 00:37:31,944
I know,
but I think we really ought to go

622
00:37:32,064 --> 00:37:33,921
so we can come back
for the lockdown.

623
00:37:34,533 --> 00:37:38,384
There's plenty of time to get ready.
The lock-in is not until

624
00:37:38,544 --> 00:37:39,610
tomorrow night.

625
00:37:39,908 --> 00:37:42,001
- You wanted to see me?
- Oh good. Holly, Rufus,

626
00:37:42,121 --> 00:37:44,034
I'd like you to meet
an aide of mine.

627
00:37:45,157 --> 00:37:46,318
This is Gabe.

628
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,019
Pleased to meet you.

629
00:37:51,226 --> 00:37:52,606
<i>Nice, very nice.</i>

630
00:37:52,726 --> 00:37:54,659
<i>She's got the perfect
amount of titties showing.</i>

631
00:37:54,779 --> 00:37:57,486
Gabe here is gonna be joining us
for the rest of the tour.

632
00:38:10,405 --> 00:38:11,705
I know that pig.

633
00:38:19,293 --> 00:38:20,151
Pig!

634
00:38:25,049 --> 00:38:26,066
Hey, pig!

635
00:38:28,469 --> 00:38:29,477
Wait up, pig!

636
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:37,903
Stupid fucking pig.

637
00:38:40,593 --> 00:38:43,910
How amazingly exhilarating was that?

638
00:38:44,457 --> 00:38:47,879
- My heart's still pounding.
- I know. Mine too.

639
00:38:50,505 --> 00:38:52,326
Hey, why'd you become a pig?

640
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:55,939
Because I was expecting
to see you become a doe again.

641
00:38:56,622 --> 00:38:58,412
Pig is my go-to shift.

642
00:38:59,641 --> 00:39:02,022
It almost seemed like Andy
recognized you.

643
00:39:02,142 --> 00:39:03,177
You know?

644
00:39:03,369 --> 00:39:05,646
The way he was yelling at you, like,

645
00:39:05,766 --> 00:39:06,766
"Pig!"

646
00:39:07,341 --> 00:39:08,341
"Pig!"

647
00:39:08,854 --> 00:39:11,133
Isn't "pig" exactly
what you would call a pig

648
00:39:11,253 --> 00:39:12,650
that you didn't know?

649
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:18,200
Yeah, but still, it's...
It's weird.

650
00:39:19,385 --> 00:39:20,385
Hush.

651
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:37,898
Remember me?

652
00:39:38,018 --> 00:39:39,018
Oh, shit.

653
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:42,417
You do.

654
00:39:42,793 --> 00:39:43,843
How's life?

655
00:39:45,106 --> 00:39:46,374
Not so good.

656
00:39:47,436 --> 00:39:48,468
Is you real?

657
00:39:49,416 --> 00:39:50,566
This is nice.

658
00:39:51,024 --> 00:39:52,845
I could sleep here in a pinch.

659
00:39:53,512 --> 00:39:56,374
What is you doing here?
I ain't said nothing to nobody.

660
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:57,698
And I knew you wouldn't.

661
00:39:57,818 --> 00:40:00,414
Why didn't the fuck y'all
just glamour me, huh?

662
00:40:01,036 --> 00:40:03,433
Poor thing. We would have,
but then you wouldn't

663
00:40:03,553 --> 00:40:05,197
remember that you owed us.

664
00:40:06,194 --> 00:40:07,158
Owe you?

665
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,513
Eric sent me with a request.

666
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,579
You're back in business.

667
00:40:11,739 --> 00:40:13,039
Oh, no, I ain't.

668
00:40:13,183 --> 00:40:14,498
I'm out of that shit.

669
00:40:14,941 --> 00:40:16,083
So sorry,

670
00:40:16,243 --> 00:40:17,960
but you're very much

671
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,295
back in this shit.

672
00:40:19,455 --> 00:40:20,755
You locked me up

673
00:40:21,092 --> 00:40:22,965
and tortured me for damn near

674
00:40:23,126 --> 00:40:24,508
three motherfucking weeks

675
00:40:24,668 --> 00:40:26,768
because you caught me selling V.

676
00:40:26,975 --> 00:40:28,025
And now...?

677
00:40:28,645 --> 00:40:29,645
Now what?

678
00:40:31,589 --> 00:40:34,060
What the fuck is vampires
doing selling V anyway?

679
00:40:35,417 --> 00:40:37,162
We're not, you are.

680
00:40:38,265 --> 00:40:39,365
Get to work.

681
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:49,740
Now I'd like to take you all to see
a very special part of the church.

682
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,982
- There's more?
- Yes. My father's tomb.

683
00:40:52,102 --> 00:40:53,439
It's on the lower level.

684
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:55,924
- Honey, are you sure?
- Absolutely, darling.

685
00:40:56,044 --> 00:40:58,793
Steve, I just don't see why
we need to take 'em down there.

686
00:40:58,953 --> 00:41:00,961
You can feel the presence
of his spirit.

687
00:41:01,121 --> 00:41:03,422
- We don't need to see it.
- Oh, I insist.

688
00:41:03,582 --> 00:41:04,965
Our church was built on,

689
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:07,133
much like St. Peter's tomb
in the Catholic Church,

690
00:41:07,253 --> 00:41:08,847
only without being polluted by evil.

691
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,388
Did you know that there was
actually a vampire pope

692
00:41:11,548 --> 00:41:13,046
back in the Middle Ages?

693
00:41:19,682 --> 00:41:21,482
- What's the matter?
- It's no big deal.

694
00:41:21,642 --> 00:41:24,151
She just has a tiny
little case of claustrophobia.

695
00:41:24,486 --> 00:41:26,036
We both do, actually.

696
00:41:26,355 --> 00:41:28,906
Well, at least take
a quick little look-see,

697
00:41:29,066 --> 00:41:30,972
that way you can say
you saw the whole church

698
00:41:31,092 --> 00:41:32,993
and you make informed discussions.

699
00:41:33,153 --> 00:41:35,733
It's all right, Sarah.
This is something they need to see.

700
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:40,918
But we've already decided
that we're getting married here,

701
00:41:41,078 --> 00:41:42,878
so how about we go back
to our apartment,

702
00:41:43,038 --> 00:41:46,132
we'll look at a calendar and we'll
call you on the phone to set the date.

703
00:41:47,711 --> 00:41:48,761
Get off me!

704
00:41:52,869 --> 00:41:54,807
Is something happening
to your human?

705
00:41:56,343 --> 00:41:57,476
Let go of me!

706
00:41:57,847 --> 00:41:58,847
Come on!

707
00:41:59,972 --> 00:42:01,188
A little help here, Gabe!

708
00:42:01,515 --> 00:42:03,899
Pretty sure the banger's on V,
the fucking cunt!

709
00:42:04,893 --> 00:42:05,835
Help!

710
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,695
I made you.

711
00:42:07,855 --> 00:42:09,321
Your blood knows mine.

712
00:42:09,626 --> 00:42:11,157
You will never physically

713
00:42:11,317 --> 00:42:12,467
overpower me.

714
00:42:19,367 --> 00:42:21,333
- I got her!
- I'm sorry.

715
00:42:21,493 --> 00:42:22,809
Stop fighting me!

716
00:42:29,857 --> 00:42:31,057
What the hell?

717
00:42:31,617 --> 00:42:35,192
Just when I thought today
couldn't get any fucking freakier.

718
00:42:39,236 --> 00:42:40,678
People are pigs.

719
00:42:40,798 --> 00:42:42,326
You got that right.

720
00:42:47,391 --> 00:42:48,991
Here. Take this joint.

721
00:43:10,725 --> 00:43:12,211
Shouldn't have smoked that joint,

722
00:43:12,331 --> 00:43:14,470
because this is really
freaking my shit out.

723
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:16,011
I feel like that kid in <i>E.T.</i>

724
00:43:16,131 --> 00:43:19,506
Except instead of following
Reese's Pieces, we following clothes.

725
00:43:19,626 --> 00:43:22,954
I ain't never seen <i>E.T.</i>
but Reese's Pieces sound real good.

726
00:43:23,515 --> 00:43:24,805
Don't they though?

727
00:45:14,123 --> 00:45:15,169
Who is it?

728
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:17,092
It's... It's Hoyt.

729
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:21,772
Come on, open up.

730
00:45:21,892 --> 00:45:23,842
I know you must be mad at me.

731
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,434
I'm so sorry.
My mama

732
00:45:25,594 --> 00:45:28,228
canceled my cell service,
and I had no way to get in touch.

733
00:45:29,407 --> 00:45:31,407
I got here as fast as I could.

734
00:45:35,602 --> 00:45:37,202
I'm so sorry, Jessica.

735
00:45:37,959 --> 00:45:39,409
I can't believe it.

736
00:45:39,936 --> 00:45:41,283
You came all this way?

737
00:45:42,504 --> 00:45:43,994
You're not mad at me?

738
00:45:46,295 --> 00:45:47,664
I'm so happy, I could cry,

739
00:45:47,824 --> 00:45:50,459
but I don't want to
because it's really gross when I do.

740
00:45:52,849 --> 00:45:54,755
And I'm sorry about the flowers too.
I got 'em

741
00:45:54,915 --> 00:45:57,841
in Bon Temps before I left,
and it was just really hot in my car.

742
00:45:58,001 --> 00:45:59,431
They're beautiful.

743
00:46:24,194 --> 00:46:25,194
Anyone?

744
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:27,788
I'm up here.

745
00:46:28,396 --> 00:46:30,046
Up here on the balcony.

746
00:46:33,297 --> 00:46:35,741
I just wanted to tell you
that uh, Luke and me,

747
00:46:35,861 --> 00:46:38,674
we're done with the...
the platform.

748
00:46:38,834 --> 00:46:39,834
Great.

749
00:46:41,208 --> 00:46:42,208
Thank you.

750
00:46:45,459 --> 00:46:46,709
Are you crying?

751
00:46:57,093 --> 00:46:59,611
I'm sorry. You're not supposed
to see me like this.

752
00:47:00,084 --> 00:47:01,947
That's okay. Really.

753
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:05,075
What's the matter?

754
00:47:05,584 --> 00:47:06,634
It's Steve.

755
00:47:08,813 --> 00:47:10,831
He's not the man I thought he was.

756
00:47:13,468 --> 00:47:15,544
Your husband is a great man.

757
00:47:16,654 --> 00:47:17,754
And I feel bad

758
00:47:17,914 --> 00:47:19,998
about what we did last night too,

759
00:47:21,211 --> 00:47:24,079
But we can't try to make
it easier on ourselves by...

760
00:47:24,257 --> 00:47:25,554
By blaming the victim.

761
00:47:28,774 --> 00:47:30,924
You and Luke and all the others,

762
00:47:32,195 --> 00:47:34,146
you're not being
trained to defend us.

763
00:47:36,382 --> 00:47:39,932
He wants to use you to start a war.

764
00:47:40,597 --> 00:47:42,676
Does that sound like
a great man to you?

765
00:47:44,843 --> 00:47:46,843
- What?
- Well, he's not one.

766
00:47:48,827 --> 00:47:50,398
And I thought he was,

767
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:55,086
but lately I've been seeing
a side of him I never did before.

768
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:59,254
He's vicious and he's cruel

769
00:47:59,653 --> 00:48:01,298
and he uses the C-word.

770
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:05,172
And he lies to me, Jason.

771
00:48:05,898 --> 00:48:09,682
Our marriage has always been
a partnership, but he's shutting me out.

772
00:48:11,872 --> 00:48:12,768
Come on, now.

773
00:48:12,928 --> 00:48:13,928
Here.

774
00:48:14,345 --> 00:48:15,907
Don't... Don't cry.

775
00:48:20,412 --> 00:48:21,612
Now, all gone.

776
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:33,642
- I should go.
- When I was a little girl,

777
00:48:35,141 --> 00:48:37,241
I realized that I had a calling.

778
00:48:38,787 --> 00:48:40,334
And I was put here on this Earth

779
00:48:40,454 --> 00:48:42,965
to be that great woman
behind her great man.

780
00:48:43,618 --> 00:48:45,133
And when Steve came into my life,

781
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,386
I thought he was that man.

782
00:48:49,082 --> 00:48:50,622
But now I see it

783
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:53,288
clear as day.

784
00:48:55,401 --> 00:48:57,301
I'm supposed to be with you.

785
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,695
We can't.
It's wrong.

786
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:09,324
- You're married.
- Not in my heart.

787
00:49:11,004 --> 00:49:12,104
Not anymore.

788
00:49:13,265 --> 00:49:15,015
And how can this be wrong

789
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:18,406
if it's what God's
commanding me to do.

790
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:23,840
Think God

791
00:49:24,509 --> 00:49:25,909
really wants this?

792
00:49:33,604 --> 00:49:34,904
You talk to him?

793
00:49:35,668 --> 00:49:38,000
Every single day of my life.

794
00:49:40,926 --> 00:49:42,676
And he wants this, Jason.

795
00:49:43,171 --> 00:49:44,171
Oh, God,

796
00:49:45,097 --> 00:49:46,097
I promise.

797
00:50:18,659 --> 00:50:21,629
- Where are you taking me?
- Don't be such a nervous Nellie.

798
00:50:21,749 --> 00:50:23,049
It's a surprise.

799
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,280
What?

800
00:50:33,494 --> 00:50:35,044
You don't like drums?

801
00:50:36,502 --> 00:50:38,080
It's just that in my experience,

802
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,873
no good can come from drum music.

803
00:50:40,811 --> 00:50:43,460
Follow it and all it ever leads you to
is hippies and cults.

804
00:50:44,133 --> 00:50:45,170
Not this time.

805
00:50:51,795 --> 00:50:52,845
Sorry, Sam.

806
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:55,722
What the hell's going on?

807
00:51:19,366 --> 00:51:21,247
What the fuck is this?

808
00:51:21,869 --> 00:51:23,458
It's the end of the road.
