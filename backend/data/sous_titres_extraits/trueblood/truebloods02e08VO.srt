1
00:00:10,762 --> 00:00:12,720
Godric, it's me.

2
00:00:21,016 --> 00:00:22,713
You should not have come.

3
00:00:28,042 --> 00:00:29,492
I'm here, my child.

4
00:00:30,236 --> 00:00:31,113
Down here.

5
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,797
You were a fool
for sending humans after me.

6
00:00:49,422 --> 00:00:50,966
I had no other choice.

7
00:00:51,515 --> 00:00:53,185
These savages,

8
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,054
they seek to destroy you.

9
00:00:56,798 --> 00:00:58,930
I'm aware of what they have planned.

10
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:02,711
This one betrayed you.

11
00:01:02,836 --> 00:01:04,230
He's with the Fellowship.

12
00:01:04,426 --> 00:01:05,988
They set a trap for us.

13
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:09,919
- How long since you've fed?
- I require very little blood anymore.

14
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:15,319
Save the human.

15
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,327
- Go on.
- I'm not leaving your side until you...

16
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,913
- I can take care of myself.
- Come on, we have to go.

17
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,124
Spill no blood on your way out.

18
00:01:25,306 --> 00:01:26,293
Go.

19
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,966
Sync: mpm & Arrow

20
00:03:14,863 --> 00:03:15,736
I'm alive.

21
00:03:18,046 --> 00:03:19,046
Holy shit.

22
00:03:20,964 --> 00:03:22,075
God saved me.

23
00:03:24,115 --> 00:03:25,241
I'm saved.

24
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:28,289
For heaven's sake,
grow a brain cell!

25
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:29,416
Paintballs!

26
00:03:29,866 --> 00:03:30,866
What's...?

27
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,464
You crazy bitch.

28
00:03:35,906 --> 00:03:37,788
I let you into my house,

29
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:39,439
into my bed

30
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:41,767
and into my heart.

31
00:03:42,586 --> 00:03:45,182
All I stood for, all I believed in,

32
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:47,016
I violated to be with you!

33
00:03:48,381 --> 00:03:50,481
I gave you everything for a lie.

34
00:03:52,016 --> 00:03:54,149
- You're worse than Judas.
- Why? What did he do to you?

35
00:03:56,963 --> 00:03:57,768
Fuck you!

36
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:02,658
Sweet Jesus!

37
00:04:05,671 --> 00:04:07,062
I'm sorry, okay?

38
00:04:07,187 --> 00:04:09,707
Just tell me what you want me to say.
Don't shoot me again.

39
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,423
You came to prey on me,
to ruin the sacred vow

40
00:04:12,548 --> 00:04:14,939
I made to my husband,
then like a coward, you ran!

41
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:16,381
No, I didn't...

42
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:19,431
Okay, I ran, but it wasn't from you.

43
00:04:19,941 --> 00:04:21,487
It was from your husband

44
00:04:21,867 --> 00:04:23,845
and his crazy weapon collection.

45
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:26,004
Why'd you have to go and tell him?

46
00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:27,129
Tell him?

47
00:04:27,591 --> 00:04:30,102
I didn't tell him anything.
He's the one who told me.

48
00:04:32,191 --> 00:04:33,625
Wait, wait, wait.

49
00:04:35,278 --> 00:04:36,233
Told you what?

50
00:04:37,006 --> 00:04:39,396
There are wolves in our henhouse.

51
00:04:40,505 --> 00:04:42,255
We must defend our flock.

52
00:04:43,523 --> 00:04:45,701
- What's that got to do with...?
- We have your sister.

53
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:49,788
Sookie's in the church?

54
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:53,082
She came in yesterday
spouting the same lies you told.

55
00:04:53,546 --> 00:04:56,636
You listen to me.
She's got nothing to do with this.

56
00:04:56,761 --> 00:04:58,662
You Stackhouses.

57
00:05:00,524 --> 00:05:03,528
You're nothing but a bunch
of heartless,

58
00:05:04,278 --> 00:05:05,378
two-faced...

59
00:05:05,903 --> 00:05:07,765
vampire fuckers.

60
00:05:11,493 --> 00:05:13,812
Don't you ever talk
about my sister like that.

61
00:05:15,085 --> 00:05:18,081
And if I find out any of you
so much as touched her,

62
00:05:18,702 --> 00:05:20,390
I'm gonna come back here...

63
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:23,962
and it won't be
with no fucking paint gun!

64
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:42,521
<i>Brothers and sisters,
we are on lockdown.</i>

65
00:05:42,646 --> 00:05:45,774
<i>Women with children, please take them
to our classroom buildings.</i>

66
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:48,347
<i>Men and able-bodied women,
security personnel</i>

67
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,683
<i>will provide you with stakes and silver
just outside the chapel.</i>

68
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:54,836
<i>Our Soldiers of the Sun are on their way
to protect our church,</i>

69
00:05:54,961 --> 00:05:57,211
<i>but safely evacuate
the building now.</i>

70
00:05:57,336 --> 00:05:59,984
<i>Brothers and sisters,
the hour is upon us.</i>

71
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,713
- I could have you out in seconds.
- There's kids out there.

72
00:06:02,838 --> 00:06:05,196
Now, those humans wouldn't
think twice about hurting us.

73
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,907
Why didn't you bring Bill with you?

74
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:09,033
His attachment to you is irrational.

75
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,661
It clouds his judgment.

76
00:06:11,278 --> 00:06:13,330
He would kill every child
in this church to save you.

77
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,999
Why aren't you?

78
00:06:16,842 --> 00:06:19,044
I'm following Godric's orders
and getting you out,

79
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,262
that's all.

80
00:06:20,387 --> 00:06:21,880
He's your maker, isn't he?

81
00:06:22,406 --> 00:06:24,299
Don't use words
you don't understand.

82
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,885
You have a lot of love for him.

83
00:06:28,595 --> 00:06:30,556
Don't use words I don't understand.

84
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,870
Let's lock it up!

85
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:38,709
Keep quiet!

86
00:06:39,996 --> 00:06:42,391
All right, lock it up.
Nobody comes through here.

87
00:06:50,474 --> 00:06:51,474
Trust me.

88
00:06:59,872 --> 00:07:01,086
Is it locked?

89
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,173
- Did you check upstairs?
- Hey, y'all. How's it going?

90
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:08,279
Steve sent me over to man
the exit here.

91
00:07:08,873 --> 00:07:10,792
Think I can take it from here.

92
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,770
- By yourself?
- Yeah.

93
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:16,119
You're big and all,
but there's a vampire on the loose.

94
00:07:17,482 --> 00:07:18,729
Where's your stake?

95
00:07:20,668 --> 00:07:21,668
Dang.

96
00:07:22,257 --> 00:07:23,257
I forgot.

97
00:07:26,582 --> 00:07:28,932
Maybe I can borrow yours if...
If that's okay.

98
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:31,448
I can't do that.

99
00:07:32,064 --> 00:07:33,077
Get your own.

100
00:07:34,001 --> 00:07:37,164
I'd very much
like to borrow your stake.

101
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:42,659
Yeah, that'd be okay, I guess.

102
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,049
Stake!

103
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,764
You don't have to kill him.

104
00:08:00,115 --> 00:08:01,115
Come on.

105
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:06,179
Those arrows are wood.
You'll never make it through.

106
00:08:06,304 --> 00:08:07,820
Eric, through the sanctuary.

107
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,058
- Where's the exit?
- Back that way.

108
00:08:18,183 --> 00:08:20,332
There are several exits, actually.

109
00:08:21,404 --> 00:08:22,404
For you,

110
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,470
the easiest one
takes you straight to hell.

111
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:35,999
Let us leave.

112
00:08:36,812 --> 00:08:39,434
Save yourselves.
No one has to die.

113
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:42,813
The war has begun,
you evil whore of Satan.

114
00:08:42,982 --> 00:08:45,898
You vampires cast the first stone
by killing my family.

115
00:08:46,689 --> 00:08:48,115
The lines have been drawn.

116
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,810
You're either with us or against us.

117
00:08:52,564 --> 00:08:55,098
We are prepared for Armageddon.

118
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,805
The vampire you're holding
prisoner got away.

119
00:08:58,930 --> 00:08:59,872
He's a sheriff.

120
00:09:00,222 --> 00:09:03,631
- He's bound to send for help.
- I'm not concerned with Godric.

121
00:09:03,756 --> 00:09:06,397
Any vampire will do
for our grand celebration,

122
00:09:06,998 --> 00:09:08,338
and we got one right here.

123
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,264
I'll be fine.

124
00:09:26,596 --> 00:09:28,146
Brothers and sisters,

125
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,844
there will be a holy bonfire
at dawn.

126
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:36,751
Look, dear.

127
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:39,119
Room service sent a gift for us.

128
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:40,974
No. I don't do any...

129
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,016
Heart's pounding.

130
00:09:45,337 --> 00:09:46,543
So much tastier.

131
00:09:46,971 --> 00:09:48,295
How considerate of you.

132
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,550
That bothersome human.

133
00:09:54,876 --> 00:09:57,633
Just like an alarm clock
you can't switch off.

134
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:01,576
And 10 minutes later...

135
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,436
I'll give you first bite.

136
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,083
I am not hungry.

137
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,455
Oh, come now.

138
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:10,001
As I recall,

139
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:12,674
your appetite was always...

140
00:10:13,058 --> 00:10:14,238
insatiable.

141
00:10:15,003 --> 00:10:16,865
This human act you do
for your girlfriend

142
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,537
is charming and all,
but we both know better.

143
00:10:21,274 --> 00:10:22,274
Don't we?

144
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:24,957
Please. I... I don't want to die.

145
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:26,165
Let him go!

146
00:10:27,588 --> 00:10:28,706
I will.

147
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,527
Soon.

148
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:41,077
This one's different.

149
00:10:42,418 --> 00:10:43,767
I've never tasted...

150
00:10:47,842 --> 00:10:49,480
What are you?

151
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,052
You okay? You okay?

152
00:11:15,177 --> 00:11:17,739
- I'm not hurting you?
- No, not anymore.

153
00:11:17,864 --> 00:11:20,126
Oh, goodness.
Shut up. Keep going.

154
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:33,344
I don't know what you heard,
but those were screams of pleasure.

155
00:11:34,286 --> 00:11:35,277
Right?

156
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:36,651
Oh, my God.

157
00:11:38,691 --> 00:11:40,157
If you truly care for her,

158
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:42,576
you will take her to your car
this very moment

159
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,454
and drive her back to Bon Temps
before the sun comes up.

160
00:11:46,093 --> 00:11:46,830
Now?

161
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:47,816
Now.

162
00:11:52,287 --> 00:11:53,337
<i>Lovers.</i>

163
00:11:56,506 --> 00:11:57,716
Oh shit, hooker.

164
00:11:58,266 --> 00:11:59,266
What?

165
00:11:59,525 --> 00:12:02,159
- Isn't the lovers good?
- Not for you it ain't.

166
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,329
In this position,
it calls for a sacrifice

167
00:12:05,454 --> 00:12:07,071
in matters of the heart.

168
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,423
You gonna have to make a choice.

169
00:12:09,955 --> 00:12:11,646
But it might turn out well, right?

170
00:12:15,283 --> 00:12:16,985
You want to see your future?

171
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:21,615
Help me.

172
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:27,998
I need to talk to you.

173
00:12:28,895 --> 00:12:30,123
Yeah, sure.

174
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:37,089
I'm gonna go
and clean a grill or something.

175
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,264
Say something.
You're freaking me out.

176
00:12:49,313 --> 00:12:51,144
- What time is it? What time is it?
- What?

177
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,355
It's 10 past 12.
We just closed, why?

178
00:12:56,614 --> 00:12:58,819
It happened again.
I've lost the last couple hours.

179
00:12:58,988 --> 00:13:01,655
Are you sure?
You don't remember anything?

180
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,323
I mean, after I left you,
I got in my car

181
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:07,003
and, baby, next thing I know
I'm over...

182
00:13:07,128 --> 00:13:09,535
past Parish Road
and I'm over by the lake.

183
00:13:11,032 --> 00:13:13,125
And I wake up on the ground.
It's freezing cold.

184
00:13:15,158 --> 00:13:17,528
And I don't even know
how I got there.

185
00:13:21,908 --> 00:13:24,260
Tara, what the hell
is wrong with me?

186
00:13:25,598 --> 00:13:26,534
It's okay.

187
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:27,659
It's okay.

188
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,098
I'm here.

189
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,223
You okay to close up?

190
00:13:32,348 --> 00:13:34,645
Yeah. Yeah, y'all go on ahead.

191
00:13:35,411 --> 00:13:37,311
Come on, let's get you home.

192
00:13:53,383 --> 00:13:55,250
- Who are you?
- It's okay.

193
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,775
I'm with the Fellowship.
You gotta let me in.

194
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,402
Sorry, bro.
We're in lockdown.

195
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,061
There's a vamper inside.

196
00:14:03,017 --> 00:14:04,917
That's why they sent for me.

197
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:08,172
I'm a cadet
with the Light of Day Institute.

198
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:10,515
Came strapped.

199
00:14:14,126 --> 00:14:15,159
Honesty.

200
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,438
Dude,

201
00:14:18,552 --> 00:14:19,357
honesty.

202
00:14:20,915 --> 00:14:22,319
- Come on.
- Let's move.

203
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,503
Now, we got the vamper surrounded.

204
00:14:25,628 --> 00:14:28,251
He's got some f-ing fangbanger
chick with him.

205
00:14:28,376 --> 00:14:29,877
Now, I'm gonna take you to Steve.

206
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:32,162
- No. I got it.
- No, he needs you to...

207
00:14:34,683 --> 00:14:36,247
Is that a paintball gun?

208
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,851
Yeah, it is.

209
00:15:28,191 --> 00:15:29,240
Who is this?

210
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:31,182
Jesus Christ.

211
00:17:35,896 --> 00:17:38,989
<i>Renard Parish sheriff's department.
What's your emergency?</i>

212
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:43,228
- Sheriff's department. Anyone in there?
- <i>Is anyone there?</i>

213
00:17:43,877 --> 00:17:45,814
<i>This is the sheriff's department.
May I help you?</i>

214
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,050
You see?

215
00:18:50,377 --> 00:18:54,065
Just as our Lord our Savior
was betrayed for 30 pieces of silver,

216
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:58,011
a few ounces of silver can betray
a child of Satan to the world!

217
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:01,547
That doesn't make any sense.
How can you people listen to him?

218
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,894
I offer myself

219
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,331
in exchange for Godric's freedom.

220
00:19:10,005 --> 00:19:11,733
And the girl's as well.

221
00:19:12,656 --> 00:19:13,806
That's noble.

222
00:19:14,376 --> 00:19:17,070
But she's just as culpable
as you are.

223
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:19,699
She's a traitor to her race.

224
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,320
The human race.

225
00:19:22,198 --> 00:19:24,496
She hardly deserves mercy.

226
00:19:26,384 --> 00:19:29,583
Maybe we should tie her to you
so you can meet the sun together.

227
00:19:30,584 --> 00:19:33,421
Bet the marshmallow
would roast up nicely.

228
00:19:39,603 --> 00:19:42,305
One more step, vampire,
and the girl dies.

229
00:19:42,794 --> 00:19:45,558
If you shoot her,
everyone here will die.

230
00:19:45,969 --> 00:19:47,101
Let her go now.

231
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:49,890
Honestly, what do they see in you?

232
00:19:50,015 --> 00:19:52,231
Soldiers, some silver chains
for our friend here.

233
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:54,882
- Don't. He's done nothing to you.
- Sookie, I will be fine.

234
00:20:00,296 --> 00:20:01,741
Let her go, fuckwad!

235
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:10,875
Son of a bitch!

236
00:20:16,488 --> 00:20:17,632
Let's go.

237
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,558
- Do not kill him!
- Kill him! Kill the motherfucker!

238
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,893
Go ahead.

239
00:20:30,085 --> 00:20:31,211
Murder us.

240
00:20:31,336 --> 00:20:32,899
Murder us before God.

241
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:34,398
We are willing to die.

242
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:48,162
You have pushed us too far.

243
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,672
You expect us to sit on our thumbs

244
00:20:51,797 --> 00:20:54,544
while you round up your men
to come lynch us?

245
00:20:55,425 --> 00:20:56,975
We'll kill you first.

246
00:21:00,236 --> 00:21:01,800
Same way we did your father.

247
00:21:02,363 --> 00:21:03,136
God, no.

248
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:04,305
Murderer!

249
00:21:06,861 --> 00:21:08,011
Destroy them.

250
00:21:08,864 --> 00:21:09,934
All of them.

251
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,566
- Stop them!
- We have to go now!

252
00:21:19,163 --> 00:21:20,163
Enough!

253
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,702
You came for me, I assume.

254
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,230
Underling.

255
00:21:32,178 --> 00:21:33,540
Yeah, sheriff.

256
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:36,093
These people have not harmed me.

257
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,620
You see?

258
00:21:38,745 --> 00:21:40,073
We can coexist.

259
00:21:41,445 --> 00:21:42,601
Mr. Newlin,

260
00:21:45,397 --> 00:21:47,847
I do not wish to create bloodshed
where none in called for.

261
00:21:50,629 --> 00:21:52,227
Help me set an example.

262
00:21:53,635 --> 00:21:56,939
If we leave you in peace,
will you do the same?

263
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:01,813
I will not negotiate with subhumans.

264
00:22:04,265 --> 00:22:05,265
Kill me.

265
00:22:05,927 --> 00:22:06,927
Do it.

266
00:22:07,954 --> 00:22:09,827
Jesus will protect me.

267
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,955
I'm actually older than your Jesus.

268
00:22:13,327 --> 00:22:15,750
I wish I could have known him,
but I missed it.

269
00:22:21,705 --> 00:22:22,799
Good people,

270
00:22:23,236 --> 00:22:26,442
who of you is willing to die
for this man's madness?

271
00:22:30,486 --> 00:22:31,849
That's what I thought.

272
00:22:32,396 --> 00:22:34,102
Stand down, everyone.

273
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,063
People,

274
00:22:38,145 --> 00:22:39,145
go home.

275
00:22:39,648 --> 00:22:40,608
It's over now.

276
00:22:41,082 --> 00:22:42,712
Oh, thank God. Bill...

277
00:22:42,837 --> 00:22:44,737
It's all right.
You're safe now.

278
00:22:46,004 --> 00:22:47,104
You're safe.

279
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,470
Please, don't leave me.

280
00:22:56,213 --> 00:22:58,127
I daresay my faith in humankind

281
00:22:58,252 --> 00:22:59,902
is stronger than yours.

282
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:05,092
Come.

283
00:23:09,527 --> 00:23:10,527
Sir,

284
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:13,056
after what these humans
have done to you?

285
00:23:13,343 --> 00:23:14,559
I said come.

286
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,422
Are you sure you're okay?

287
00:23:21,782 --> 00:23:22,832
She's fine.

288
00:23:24,282 --> 00:23:25,732
Go with your maker.

289
00:23:27,747 --> 00:23:29,240
Sookie, come here.

290
00:23:32,271 --> 00:23:35,115
I'm so sorry.
Will you please forgive me?

291
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,850
What were you doing with those people?
Are you out of your mind?

292
00:23:37,975 --> 00:23:40,168
Yeah, I was. Just...

293
00:23:42,037 --> 00:23:43,921
That son of a bitch
sucked out my brain

294
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,100
and planted all his own babies
in there.

295
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:47,575
You know nothing.

296
00:23:48,771 --> 00:23:50,729
On the final day of reckoning,

297
00:23:51,744 --> 00:23:53,644
we'll see who goes to heaven

298
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,609
and who goes to hell.

299
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,300
I reckon I've already
been to heaven.

300
00:24:00,885 --> 00:24:02,585
It was inside your wife.

301
00:24:07,608 --> 00:24:08,780
Jason, come on.

302
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,155
What about that?

303
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:12,603
- Come on.
- Take your ring.

304
00:24:13,366 --> 00:24:15,487
Honesty, my ass, shithead.

305
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:18,161
White-suit motherfucker.

306
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:22,391
Go home, preacher boy.

307
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,096
Come on, Sam.
We can't tell you that.

308
00:24:33,503 --> 00:24:35,381
That's why it's called
an anonymous tip.

309
00:24:35,506 --> 00:24:37,305
We can't tell you who phoned it in.

310
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,714
They wanted you to find me.

311
00:24:40,775 --> 00:24:43,632
Why would I keep a body
in my own refrigerator

312
00:24:46,007 --> 00:24:47,397
Was it a woman's voice?

313
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,197
There's a rumor you were having
a relationship with the deceased.

314
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:52,515
Is that true?

315
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,952
You don't seem too beat up about it.

316
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,170
Well, we...

317
00:24:58,728 --> 00:25:00,957
- I guess we kind of broke up.
- Were you angry?

318
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,565
- Bound to be some hurt feelings.
- Listen,

319
00:25:04,365 --> 00:25:05,783
y'all have to trust me.

320
00:25:06,636 --> 00:25:07,886
This is bigger

321
00:25:08,011 --> 00:25:10,174
and crazier
than you can even imagine.

322
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,330
I'll say.

323
00:25:11,773 --> 00:25:13,221
This is the second time

324
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:15,638
a woman's been found in your bar
with her heart missing.

325
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:18,599
And the third time a waitress
of yours has ended up dead.

326
00:25:18,813 --> 00:25:20,181
That was Rene Lenier.

327
00:25:20,306 --> 00:25:22,306
You can't use that against me.

328
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:25,928
Come on, Bud, Kenya.
Listen to yourselves.

329
00:25:26,632 --> 00:25:28,937
- You know me.
- I'm not sure we do.

330
00:25:29,107 --> 00:25:31,988
You got no birth records,
no Social Security number.

331
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:34,510
We can't even find
where you went to high school.

332
00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:37,535
It's hard to explain.

333
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:40,636
Save it, son. Nothing about
your past ever checks out.

334
00:25:41,389 --> 00:25:43,749
Why don't you just tell us
what happened tonight?

335
00:25:46,239 --> 00:25:47,503
What the...?

336
00:25:48,574 --> 00:25:50,756
Hold up.
Bud, you don think it's Sam, do you?

337
00:25:50,881 --> 00:25:52,550
- Let me get him.
- Hold on, Kenya.

338
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:55,419
You're on suspension.

339
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,667
- How'd you hear about this?
- Still got my radio.

340
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,837
I'm not here as a cop, okay?
I'm a witness.

341
00:26:01,962 --> 00:26:03,102
You got the wrong guy.

342
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,916
- What?
- He's not the one you want.

343
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:06,109
He's a victim.

344
00:26:06,234 --> 00:26:08,311
I saw him nearly get killed
last night.

345
00:26:08,571 --> 00:26:10,147
- By who?
- The bull.

346
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:11,361
The what?

347
00:26:13,082 --> 00:26:14,780
He thinks he saw some kind of bull.

348
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,418
With claws. A bull.

349
00:26:16,946 --> 00:26:18,069
In a dress.

350
00:26:18,194 --> 00:26:19,076
With claws.

351
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,819
Okay.
You're babbling again.

352
00:26:20,944 --> 00:26:22,580
- I can shut him up.
- And your vic,

353
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:25,249
that vic you got in there,
she was part of the whole group

354
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,210
of crazy people
that was trying to get him.

355
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:29,178
I tried to fight them off,

356
00:26:29,816 --> 00:26:31,016
but war wound.

357
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:33,591
I'm corroborating here, Sam.

358
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,209
Tell them. Help me.

359
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:37,929
If I told you that's what happened,
would you believe me?

360
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:45,694
Oh, shit.

361
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:51,070
But you're not the only one.

362
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:54,306
I blacked out last night.
Arlene blacked out.

363
00:26:55,206 --> 00:26:57,169
Maybe there's some kind
of gas leak or something.

364
00:26:57,294 --> 00:26:59,336
But, what about Andy Bellefleur?

365
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,285
He said...
He said he saw all of us.

366
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,273
Andy's the only one
we know is out his mind.

367
00:27:08,345 --> 00:27:11,077
I got this sick feeling
I did something real bad.

368
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,449
Knock, knock.

369
00:27:14,682 --> 00:27:16,207
Hope I'm not interrupting.

370
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:20,754
No, just trying to piece together
everything we been doing those days.

371
00:27:23,454 --> 00:27:26,811
Sounds like somebody's been
enjoying himself a bit too much.

372
00:27:29,699 --> 00:27:31,941
Tell you what.
Why don't we ease up on the partying

373
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:33,503
for a little while?

374
00:27:33,805 --> 00:27:34,955
Take it easy.

375
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,117
Snack's ready.

376
00:27:49,774 --> 00:27:51,224
Hope you're hungry.

377
00:27:52,206 --> 00:27:53,333
Oh, my God.

378
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:55,168
That looks amazing.
What is it?

379
00:27:55,476 --> 00:27:56,826
Hunter's <i>soufflé</i>.

380
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,297
I didn't know hunters made <i>soufflés</i>.

381
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,591
Most don't. Dig in.

382
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:40,719
Wow, yum !

383
00:28:41,562 --> 00:28:43,967
What is in there?
Is that the rabbit you caught?

384
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:45,639
Among other things.

385
00:28:48,542 --> 00:28:50,807
You have got to try this.

386
00:28:58,967 --> 00:29:00,140
Oh, my God.

387
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:34,939
Thank you, sir.

388
00:29:36,123 --> 00:29:37,733
Welcome home, sheriff.

389
00:29:37,969 --> 00:29:39,719
We are all very relieved.

390
00:29:46,981 --> 00:29:50,424
I just want to say I'm real sorry
for what the Fellowship put you through.

391
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:57,628
You helped save many lives
today, Mr. Stackhouse.

392
00:29:58,238 --> 00:30:01,211
Please know you have friends
in this area whenever you visit.

393
00:30:02,012 --> 00:30:03,510
Thanks, man, but, I don't know

394
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,854
if I'll be wanting to come back
anytime soon.

395
00:30:10,343 --> 00:30:11,183
God.

396
00:30:17,825 --> 00:30:19,771
Hail the conquering hero.

397
00:30:20,703 --> 00:30:22,363
No. I'm no hero.

398
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,400
No, you are in this town.

399
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,537
But in my area we know you well
as a buyer and user

400
00:30:27,662 --> 00:30:29,012
of vampire blood.

401
00:30:29,478 --> 00:30:31,203
And that's a very grave offense.

402
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:33,618
Yeah, listen.
I don't do that no more.

403
00:30:34,181 --> 00:30:36,129
All things considered, however,

404
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:37,835
we'll call it even.

405
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:42,381
But you won't be doing it again.

406
00:30:47,258 --> 00:30:48,095
Got it.

407
00:30:48,406 --> 00:30:50,093
Good boy. Run along.

408
00:30:59,954 --> 00:31:01,735
Thanks, this is great.

409
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:06,820
You've avoided being alone
with me all night.

410
00:31:07,197 --> 00:31:09,825
Nonsense. With all the commotion,
there's just hardly been time.

411
00:31:11,015 --> 00:31:12,682
I was in that basement for two days.

412
00:31:12,807 --> 00:31:15,664
You don't even want to know
what almost happened to me down there.

413
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,190
Where were you?

414
00:31:17,973 --> 00:31:21,387
- Sookie, it's...
- "It's complicated" is not an answer.

415
00:31:22,346 --> 00:31:24,203
Every time I've needed you,

416
00:31:24,611 --> 00:31:27,380
you've always come running,
even in broad daylight.

417
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,940
What kept you?

418
00:31:31,624 --> 00:31:32,765
I was held.

419
00:31:33,149 --> 00:31:35,232
Held? Like kidnapped?

420
00:31:37,093 --> 00:31:38,093
By who?

421
00:31:39,568 --> 00:31:40,356
By Eric?

422
00:31:43,124 --> 00:31:44,324
Heard my name.

423
00:31:45,473 --> 00:31:48,217
- I hope you were speaking well of me?
- Why should I?

424
00:31:48,342 --> 00:31:49,865
You let me walk into a trap.

425
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,168
I regret that.

426
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:53,904
- If I had known it was a possibility...
- You did know.

427
00:31:54,102 --> 00:31:56,705
But because it was Godric,
you'd risk anything.

428
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:00,606
The bond between a vampire and his maker
is stronger than you can imagine.

429
00:32:02,266 --> 00:32:03,837
Perhaps one day you'll find out.

430
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,020
What's the matter?

431
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:25,306
What, you don't like me anymore?

432
00:32:28,023 --> 00:32:29,071
I don't think...

433
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:32,416
Bill might not like us doing
this stuff in his house.

434
00:32:32,858 --> 00:32:34,208
He'll never know.

435
00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:37,522
Come on, you drove so fast,
I know you want to again.

436
00:32:37,761 --> 00:32:38,761
Besides,

437
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,097
we got two hours before dawn.

438
00:32:55,402 --> 00:32:57,149
I can't believe I waited so long.

439
00:32:57,274 --> 00:33:00,309
We are gonna do it every single night
whether you want to or not.

440
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:02,970
You still want to, don't you?

441
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,519
Well, sure, yeah.

442
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:07,339
It's just that Sookie and Bill
might come in any minute.

443
00:33:09,137 --> 00:33:10,948
We got the house to ourselves.

444
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:11,947
I promise.

445
00:33:28,245 --> 00:33:30,811
I've never wanted anything
so bad in my life.

446
00:33:31,656 --> 00:33:33,069
Make love to me again.

447
00:33:33,362 --> 00:33:34,362
Please.

448
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,640
Do me.

449
00:33:39,098 --> 00:33:40,098
Now.

450
00:33:55,332 --> 00:33:56,737
Wait, stop, stop.

451
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Sorry.

452
00:34:00,917 --> 00:34:03,119
- What happened?
- I don't know. It just...

453
00:34:04,104 --> 00:34:05,459
I mean, it's felt like...

454
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,510
Is that blood again?

455
00:34:16,616 --> 00:34:17,666
Oh, my God.

456
00:34:23,544 --> 00:34:25,803
- What, Jessica, what?
- It grew back.

457
00:34:25,973 --> 00:34:28,130
- It? What?
- My...

458
00:34:28,255 --> 00:34:29,483
It fucking grew back.

459
00:34:32,716 --> 00:34:34,319
I should have known.
Everything heals

460
00:34:34,444 --> 00:34:36,361
when you're a goddamn vampire.

461
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,225
Okay, come on. Come on.

462
00:34:40,326 --> 00:34:43,284
It's gonna be beautiful.
Every time will be like our first time.

463
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,048
It'll hurt like hell.

464
00:34:45,906 --> 00:34:48,106
I'm a fucking deformity of nature.

465
00:34:49,332 --> 00:34:51,213
I'm gonna be a virgin forever.

466
00:35:06,234 --> 00:35:07,631
I don't like being touched.

467
00:35:07,756 --> 00:35:10,007
Believe me,
I do not like touching you.

468
00:35:11,595 --> 00:35:13,777
Your contact with Sookie
will cease from this moment.

469
00:35:14,009 --> 00:35:15,571
That's hardly your decision.

470
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:18,740
Calling in my maker because you
couldn't win Sookie for yourself

471
00:35:19,676 --> 00:35:21,410
is feeble and desperate
even for you.

472
00:35:22,432 --> 00:35:23,896
Are you picking a fight?

473
00:35:26,957 --> 00:35:28,250
I'd like to see you try.

474
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:30,118
She will never be yours.

475
00:35:30,403 --> 00:35:32,296
And there is nothing you can do.

476
00:35:33,082 --> 00:35:34,863
In this you are powerless.

477
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:37,041
Accept it.

478
00:35:43,105 --> 00:35:44,183
This is the one

479
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:45,392
who betrayed us.

480
00:35:57,757 --> 00:35:59,031
He's your human, is he not?

481
00:35:59,968 --> 00:36:01,018
Yes, he is.

482
00:36:03,311 --> 00:36:04,574
Do you love him?

483
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:14,337
I thought I did.

484
00:36:21,574 --> 00:36:23,574
It appears you love him still.

485
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:26,039
I do.

486
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,640
I'm sorry.

487
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,021
But you are my sheriff.
Do with him

488
00:36:31,277 --> 00:36:32,477
as you please.

489
00:36:35,628 --> 00:36:36,911
You are free to go.

490
00:36:40,771 --> 00:36:41,771
What?

491
00:36:41,896 --> 00:36:43,594
The human is free to go.

492
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:48,372
And do not return.

493
00:36:50,206 --> 00:36:52,084
I fear it is not safe for you here.

494
00:36:52,671 --> 00:36:53,836
This is a travesty.

495
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:55,454
This is my verdict.

496
00:36:58,486 --> 00:36:59,591
Escort them out.

497
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:01,510
Make sure he leaves unharmed.

498
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:07,567
Thank you.

499
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:09,685
Thank you, sheriff.

500
00:37:22,648 --> 00:37:24,067
What was that about?

501
00:37:24,641 --> 00:37:26,910
Godric is sheriff
and he has the authority to...

502
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,065
I mean, with Eric.
Why are you talking to him

503
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,372
if he kidnapped you?

504
00:37:31,038 --> 00:37:32,249
It wasn't Eric.

505
00:37:32,722 --> 00:37:33,542
Then who?

506
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,846
Is there someplace
we can talk in private?

507
00:37:38,971 --> 00:37:40,415
This really isn't the time...

508
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,515
Look, if I don't say this now,
I never will.

509
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,129
Look, please,
it'll only take a minute.

510
00:37:45,832 --> 00:37:47,232
Let's go out back.

511
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:49,692
Thanks.

512
00:37:50,952 --> 00:37:52,427
I know everyone says it,

513
00:37:52,552 --> 00:37:54,658
but I'm really not the guy you want.

514
00:37:55,863 --> 00:37:57,990
If it's like you said,
that there's something out there

515
00:37:58,115 --> 00:37:59,740
that's fixing to get you,

516
00:38:00,855 --> 00:38:02,946
then jail's just about
the safest place

517
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,973
to spend the night.
Now, come on.

518
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,464
Hey, Sam. Join the party.

519
00:38:11,072 --> 00:38:12,289
- What...?
- I'd come

520
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,939
and give you a hug,
but I lost my pants.

521
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,166
Yeah, it's been a hell of a night.

522
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:18,570
Must be a full moon.

523
00:38:18,695 --> 00:38:20,236
Pretty sure it's not.

524
00:38:20,406 --> 00:38:21,406
Mike?

525
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:23,352
What'd they arrest you for?

526
00:38:23,896 --> 00:38:24,797
Sodomy.

527
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,133
- What?
- Yeah, they say I...

528
00:38:28,136 --> 00:38:29,890
I sodomized a pine tree.

529
00:38:31,191 --> 00:38:33,431
- What'd you do that for?
- I don't know.

530
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,648
Must have blacked out,
but it's true.

531
00:38:35,773 --> 00:38:37,977
My pecker's got all kinds
of scratches on.

532
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:40,185
Don't worry, Mikey.

533
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:41,503
It'll heal.

534
00:38:41,628 --> 00:38:42,861
What are you in for?

535
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:44,890
Worse than me?

536
00:38:46,105 --> 00:38:48,205
- Leave him alone, Mike.
- Sam?

537
00:38:51,271 --> 00:38:52,321
What is it?

538
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,481
I need you to forgive me.

539
00:38:57,075 --> 00:38:58,075
What?

540
00:38:59,762 --> 00:39:01,500
You love my sister, and...

541
00:39:01,938 --> 00:39:04,390
there ain't no reason
why you shouldn't be able to.

542
00:39:06,263 --> 00:39:07,937
All this time, I let my own

543
00:39:08,062 --> 00:39:10,569
stupid ignorance stand in the way.

544
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:16,728
Thank you.

545
00:39:19,306 --> 00:39:22,455
But I am also in your debt
for helping rescue Sookie.

546
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,778
After all I did to fuck

547
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:26,780
everything up,
that's the least I can do.

548
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:31,976
I'm just sorry it took me so long

549
00:39:32,489 --> 00:39:33,839
to wake up to it.

550
00:39:34,346 --> 00:39:35,546
Well, you did.

551
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,020
Just in time.

552
00:39:54,711 --> 00:39:56,583
Well, was that okay for you?

553
00:39:58,206 --> 00:39:59,306
It was fine.

554
00:40:12,988 --> 00:40:14,638
Hugo's been dispatched.

555
00:40:15,007 --> 00:40:18,043
I told him not to stop driving
until he reaches the Mexican border.

556
00:40:19,928 --> 00:40:22,703
I've arranged
for an AB-negative human for you.

557
00:40:23,173 --> 00:40:24,423
Extremely rare.

558
00:40:25,931 --> 00:40:26,840
Thank you.

559
00:40:28,473 --> 00:40:29,670
I'm not hungry.

560
00:40:30,103 --> 00:40:32,003
You have to feed eventually.

561
00:40:33,089 --> 00:40:35,889
I doubt the Fellowship
had anything to offer.

562
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:45,418
Why wouldn't you leave
when I first came for you?

563
00:40:46,037 --> 00:40:47,887
They didn't treat me badly.

564
00:40:50,173 --> 00:40:52,324
You'd be shocked at how ordinary
most of them are.

565
00:40:52,567 --> 00:40:55,717
They do nothing but fan
the flames of hatred for us.

566
00:40:56,284 --> 00:40:57,584
Let's be honest.

567
00:40:59,031 --> 00:41:00,481
We are frightening.

568
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,634
After thousands of years,
we haven't evolved.

569
00:41:07,145 --> 00:41:09,095
We've only grown more brutal,

570
00:41:10,496 --> 00:41:11,746
more predatory.

571
00:41:15,581 --> 00:41:18,494
I don't see the danger
in treating humans as equals.

572
00:41:20,184 --> 00:41:23,279
The Fellowship of the Sun
arose because we never did so.

573
00:41:27,007 --> 00:41:29,418
Is that why you wouldn't fight
when they took you?

574
00:41:31,441 --> 00:41:34,580
I could have killed
every last one of them within minutes.

575
00:41:39,873 --> 00:41:41,835
And what would that have proven?

576
00:41:51,563 --> 00:41:53,169
Oh, my God.

577
00:41:53,294 --> 00:41:54,799
I inhaled that fucker.

578
00:41:57,609 --> 00:41:58,598
You know what?

579
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,803
I didn't think it was possible,

580
00:42:00,973 --> 00:42:03,136
but this is better than her pie.

581
00:42:03,306 --> 00:42:04,356
Way better.

582
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:06,694
I gotta learn how to cook.

583
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,380
You know, I feel like
a superhero. I mean...

584
00:42:11,707 --> 00:42:13,069
You look like one.

585
00:42:16,295 --> 00:42:17,495
How about now?

586
00:42:21,513 --> 00:42:23,501
I mean, I feel invincible, you know?

587
00:42:23,626 --> 00:42:25,292
Like nobody could even hurt me.

588
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:29,963
I hate you.

589
00:42:30,755 --> 00:42:32,299
I fucking hate your guts.

590
00:42:33,845 --> 00:42:36,335
You fucking bitch.
I fucking hate you too.

591
00:42:41,406 --> 00:42:43,406
You're not even trying, are you?

592
00:42:57,604 --> 00:42:58,571
More.

593
00:43:06,506 --> 00:43:08,371
Is that all you got?
I mean...

594
00:43:16,017 --> 00:43:17,017
Now, that

595
00:43:17,499 --> 00:43:19,099
feels so fucking good.

596
00:43:33,145 --> 00:43:34,406
Damn, boy.

597
00:43:36,306 --> 00:43:37,484
Do it again.

598
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,662
Fuck, I want you so bad.

599
00:44:33,463 --> 00:44:34,482
That's great.

600
00:44:34,607 --> 00:44:35,607
Me too.

601
00:44:36,082 --> 00:44:37,007
Hello, there.

602
00:44:38,101 --> 00:44:39,151
I'm Lorena.

603
00:44:40,406 --> 00:44:42,299
Nice to meet you.
I'm Sookie.

604
00:44:45,339 --> 00:44:47,304
You are what all the fuss is about.

605
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,767
Excuse me?

606
00:44:50,622 --> 00:44:52,393
Aren't you a morsel.

607
00:44:53,892 --> 00:44:54,823
I'm sorry.

608
00:44:54,948 --> 00:44:56,067
Who are you?

609
00:44:57,073 --> 00:44:58,073
Well,

610
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:00,025
we have a mutual friend.

611
00:45:00,514 --> 00:45:02,069
- Bill?
- That's right.

612
00:45:02,676 --> 00:45:04,576
Funny he never mentioned me.

613
00:45:04,834 --> 00:45:07,998
I practically made him
what he is today.

614
00:45:09,965 --> 00:45:11,398
Hello, darling.

615
00:45:11,912 --> 00:45:14,145
I was just getting to know
your plaything.

616
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:16,959
You always did like to prey
on the innocent.

617
00:45:18,778 --> 00:45:21,512
- Is this your maker?
- She released me years ago.

618
00:45:22,107 --> 00:45:23,845
She no longer has any hold over me.

619
00:45:24,107 --> 00:45:25,607
I wouldn't say that.

620
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:28,095
We had two marvelous nights
in your room.

621
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:29,125
What?

622
00:45:29,256 --> 00:45:32,004
Did you know your boyfriend
hit me over the head

623
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:35,339
with a 52-inch plasma television
earlier tonight?

624
00:45:36,205 --> 00:45:38,049
Everyone says
they're so thin and light,

625
00:45:38,174 --> 00:45:40,632
but let me tell you,
when wielded properly,

626
00:45:40,757 --> 00:45:41,863
it's quite a weapon.

627
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:43,748
- You did?
- You need to leave.

628
00:45:43,873 --> 00:45:45,867
I hope he doesn't pull
the same shenanigans

629
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:47,035
with you.

630
00:45:47,407 --> 00:45:50,200
There's no excuse
for domestic violence.

631
00:45:50,501 --> 00:45:53,458
What she has failed to mention
is that she was holding me prisoner.

632
00:45:53,775 --> 00:45:54,775
Pshaw.

633
00:45:55,206 --> 00:45:57,356
We were just catching up is all.

634
00:45:58,417 --> 00:46:00,382
You must have been worried sick,

635
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:02,200
wondering where he was.

636
00:46:03,728 --> 00:46:04,636
I admit it.

637
00:46:04,966 --> 00:46:06,066
It got a bit

638
00:46:06,826 --> 00:46:07,667
heated.

639
00:46:07,792 --> 00:46:10,308
But you know how old lovers
can get sometimes.

640
00:46:10,644 --> 00:46:12,102
Do not touch him.

641
00:46:14,869 --> 00:46:15,769
My,

642
00:46:16,937 --> 00:46:18,441
we're feisty too.

643
00:46:26,012 --> 00:46:28,112
You're no more than a blood bag.

644
00:46:29,103 --> 00:46:30,620
You cannot win this.

645
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,138
I've already won.

646
00:46:33,028 --> 00:46:34,522
Bill chose me.

647
00:46:35,227 --> 00:46:36,227
And yet

648
00:46:36,451 --> 00:46:38,230
you still won't give up.

649
00:46:39,414 --> 00:46:40,984
Don't you have any shame?

650
00:46:41,109 --> 00:46:41,965
Stop.

651
00:46:42,494 --> 00:46:43,894
I'd listen to him.

652
00:46:45,746 --> 00:46:47,890
Run away, little girl.

653
00:46:48,871 --> 00:46:50,969
William and I love each other.

654
00:46:51,239 --> 00:46:53,389
You've gone mad.
Now get out now.

655
00:46:53,603 --> 00:46:55,895
Maybe you do love him.
Who am I to guess?

656
00:46:56,552 --> 00:46:58,252
But he doesn't love you.

657
00:46:58,589 --> 00:47:01,359
He never has, and that we both know.

658
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:06,318
Take those words back
or they shall be your last.

659
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,366
- We're leaving!
- Go find someone else,

660
00:47:08,491 --> 00:47:10,326
you fucking bitch!
You've lost this one!

661
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:20,807
Retract...

662
00:47:21,094 --> 00:47:22,057
your...

663
00:47:22,182 --> 00:47:23,182
fangs.

664
00:47:25,054 --> 00:47:26,054
Now.

665
00:47:32,659 --> 00:47:33,859
I neither know

666
00:47:35,315 --> 00:47:37,625
nor care who you are.

667
00:47:38,729 --> 00:47:40,029
But in this area

668
00:47:41,144 --> 00:47:42,937
and certainly in this nest,

669
00:47:43,317 --> 00:47:44,736
I am the authority.

670
00:47:46,753 --> 00:47:48,153
Do you understand?

671
00:47:49,651 --> 00:47:50,801
Yes, sheriff.

672
00:48:00,055 --> 00:48:02,694
This human has proven herself
to be a courageous

673
00:48:04,596 --> 00:48:06,546
and loyal friend to our kind.

674
00:48:07,776 --> 00:48:10,716
And yet you treat her like
a child does a dragonfly,

675
00:48:11,112 --> 00:48:13,012
pulling off wings for sport.

676
00:48:14,481 --> 00:48:16,131
No wonder they hate us.

677
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:18,919
She provoked me.

678
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,660
And you provoked me.

679
00:48:22,741 --> 00:48:25,241
You disrupted the peace
in my own home.

680
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:28,560
I could snap you like a twig.

681
00:48:31,646 --> 00:48:32,784
Yet I haven't.

682
00:48:33,896 --> 00:48:35,203
Now, why is that?

683
00:48:37,988 --> 00:48:38,988
It's...

684
00:48:39,303 --> 00:48:40,403
your choice.

685
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:42,443
Indeed it is.

686
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,127
You're an old vampire.
I can tell.

687
00:48:48,279 --> 00:48:50,370
You've had hundreds of years
to better yourself,

688
00:48:50,495 --> 00:48:51,795
yet you haven't.

689
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:54,914
You are still a savage,

690
00:48:55,242 --> 00:48:56,992
and I fear for all of us,

691
00:48:57,848 --> 00:49:00,142
humans and vampires,

692
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:04,061
if this behavior persists.

693
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,075
You.

694
00:49:07,488 --> 00:49:09,038
You seem to know her.

695
00:49:11,518 --> 00:49:12,448
Yes, sheriff.

696
00:49:13,828 --> 00:49:15,628
Escort her from the nest.

697
00:49:18,345 --> 00:49:19,345
Go ahead.

698
00:49:19,643 --> 00:49:20,643
I'm fine.

699
00:49:23,092 --> 00:49:25,290
I wish you out of my area
before dawn.

700
00:49:35,148 --> 00:49:36,703
I don't know how

701
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:38,173
it got this way.

702
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:41,580
I can't help it
that I still love you.

703
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,470
You know I do.

704
00:49:46,174 --> 00:49:47,174
But now

705
00:49:48,726 --> 00:49:50,176
it's become nothing

706
00:49:50,726 --> 00:49:52,734
but a constant humiliation.

707
00:49:56,668 --> 00:49:59,853
The pain that you suffer
you've inflicted upon yourself.

708
00:50:03,982 --> 00:50:06,182
When will we see each other again?

709
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:13,630
Never.

710
00:50:14,403 --> 00:50:15,653
We're immortal.

711
00:50:17,271 --> 00:50:19,988
Our paths are bound
to cross eventually.

712
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:25,225
I have him by the neck, shaking...

713
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:29,067
But... and funny you say that

714
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:30,235
because...

715
00:50:55,273 --> 00:50:56,886
What the fuck, man?

716
00:50:57,456 --> 00:50:58,975
Stay away from me, Stackhouse.

717
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,415
- Got nothing to say to you.
- What the hell you doing?

718
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:02,540
Just go.

719
00:51:07,535 --> 00:51:08,690
Excuse me, everyone.

720
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,286
If I could have your attention.

721
00:51:17,487 --> 00:51:19,237
