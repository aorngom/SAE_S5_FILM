1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,130
<i>Previously on</i> Eureka...

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,257
<i>There's an unexpected visitor
at the door.</i>

3
00:00:04,417 --> 00:00:06,051
- Auntie Lex!
- <i>Shall I let her in?</i>

4
00:00:06,255 --> 00:00:07,505
- No!
- Yes!

5
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,609
A wedding gift for Ally.

6
00:00:11,782 --> 00:00:13,804
None of us may make it through
the next time wave.

7
00:00:13,924 --> 00:00:15,678
I'll see you around, Jack.

8
00:00:18,232 --> 00:00:19,189
He's gone.

9
00:00:26,863 --> 00:00:28,426
Are you strangling something?

10
00:00:28,546 --> 00:00:31,034
Oh sorry.
Is the music too loud?

11
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:32,444
That's music?

12
00:00:33,211 --> 00:00:36,790
Yes, I composed it in India.
It's supposed to relieve stress.

13
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,808
Really? Yeah, not working.

14
00:00:39,327 --> 00:00:41,834
Give it a chance. Sometimes
you have to let art flow over you

15
00:00:41,954 --> 00:00:44,631
before you can appreciate it.
I'll make you a copy for your car.

16
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,637
Take your time.

17
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:48,968
You should be doing that
in your condition?

18
00:00:49,191 --> 00:00:50,941
Yoga's good
for the pregnancy.

19
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:53,473
And since I don't have
a Lamaze partner...

20
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:55,350
You might if you told the father.

21
00:00:55,695 --> 00:00:58,269
He's halfway across the world...
Curing cholera.

22
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:00,563
Where he belongs.
This baby is my choice.

23
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:01,766
All right.

24
00:01:02,171 --> 00:01:03,742
You want some coffee?

25
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,578
- Dad, you okay?
- Yep!

26
00:01:07,698 --> 00:01:09,853
Sorry.
I rearranged a few things.

27
00:01:09,973 --> 00:01:12,575
For a smart house,
the Feng Shui was really dumb.

28
00:01:12,735 --> 00:01:14,088
No offense, SARAH.

29
00:01:14,404 --> 00:01:16,329
<i>None taken,
it's really opened up my flow.</i>

30
00:01:16,489 --> 00:01:18,135
- What's in my coffee?
- Soy milk.

31
00:01:18,255 --> 00:01:20,959
Aunt Lexi says
that lactose gives you gas.

32
00:01:22,287 --> 00:01:25,063
Oh, Lex also says
that her cat is grandma Lil.

33
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,924
Same old Jack.
You always hated change.

34
00:01:28,044 --> 00:01:30,242
And you're always trying
to fix things that aren't broken.

35
00:01:30,503 --> 00:01:32,764
You're telling me
everything in your life is perfect?

36
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,973
Nothing could be improved
just a tiny bit?

37
00:01:35,443 --> 00:01:36,378
Well, no.

38
00:01:37,522 --> 00:01:39,018
When are you leaving?

39
00:01:39,573 --> 00:01:41,443
God, I wish I had a sibling.

40
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:43,455
Oh, problem at GD.

41
00:01:43,575 --> 00:01:45,892
So no more Feng or Shui.

42
00:01:52,856 --> 00:01:55,297
I don't think the lettering
is big enough.

43
00:01:55,841 --> 00:01:58,288
Fargo, if it was any bigger,
it'd cover the whole building.

44
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:00,999
- Your point is?
- Hey, guys.

45
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:02,500
You seen Thorne?

46
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,637
Section three at the big tomb opening.

47
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,713
There's a protester
in the preservation lab.

48
00:02:07,074 --> 00:02:08,673
What if we changed the font?

49
00:02:09,145 --> 00:02:11,014
What's the plan in here?

50
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:13,928
We're turning this into
the Nathan Stark memorial hallway.

51
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,973
I was hoping for it to be done
before Dr. Blake returned, but...

52
00:02:18,308 --> 00:02:19,017
close.

53
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:20,560
Allison's back already?

54
00:02:20,764 --> 00:02:22,581
She said she was feeling better.

55
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:25,402
Henry, I'm gonna go grab
the other color swatches.

56
00:02:25,522 --> 00:02:27,358
Come on,
I can show you where Thorne is.

57
00:02:27,671 --> 00:02:29,819
Don't do anything until I get back.

58
00:02:30,755 --> 00:02:32,150
Wouldn't think of it.

59
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,751
Here we go.

60
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:41,949
Sheriff, finally.

61
00:02:42,076 --> 00:02:45,376
Nice to see you too.
What's... the problem?

62
00:02:45,607 --> 00:02:48,338
People have no respect for the past.
That's the problem.

63
00:02:48,613 --> 00:02:49,923
You know that isn't true.

64
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:53,635
We're only attempting this project
because of our fascination with history.

65
00:02:53,826 --> 00:02:57,180
And Dr. Wilding is standing
in the way of progress, literally.

66
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,556
I want him arrested.

67
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,141
And you are?

68
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:02,860
Dr. Sebastian Marx, archaeologist.

69
00:03:03,346 --> 00:03:06,689
- I'm sure you've seen my documentaries.
- You're a disgrace to the discipline.

70
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,696
Dr. Wilding is
our resident egyptologist.

71
00:03:10,235 --> 00:03:12,612
Sheriff, they can't be allowed
to open this tomb.

72
00:03:13,752 --> 00:03:15,259
That's a tomb?

73
00:03:16,766 --> 00:03:18,189
For Queen Nyota.

74
00:03:19,905 --> 00:03:22,125
Eureka had a queen.

75
00:03:23,144 --> 00:03:24,682
No, Sheriff Carter,

76
00:03:24,877 --> 00:03:27,137
we brought the whole tomb
from Egypt.

77
00:03:27,604 --> 00:03:30,630
Had to use a superconductor to generate
a massive antigravitational field.

78
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:34,133
It's protected by a thermoplastic
multi-filament polymer.

79
00:03:34,891 --> 00:03:35,843
Air bags.

80
00:03:36,736 --> 00:03:37,648
Thank you.

81
00:03:37,768 --> 00:03:39,736
Couldn't you just open it
when you were in Egypt?

82
00:03:39,882 --> 00:03:42,225
Not under perfectly controlled
environmental conditions.

83
00:03:42,608 --> 00:03:44,185
Here we can use a metasomatic ray

84
00:03:44,345 --> 00:03:47,625
to protect the rock composition
so the tomb won't crumble.

85
00:03:47,892 --> 00:03:50,441
I mean, this is gonna be
an unprecedented achievement.

86
00:03:50,601 --> 00:03:53,415
Then we'll send it out
on an interactive 3D world tour

87
00:03:53,535 --> 00:03:55,321
that will make King Tut look tame.

88
00:04:01,565 --> 00:04:03,868
If you won't listen to me,
listen to them.

89
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:06,226
The message on that door is a warning.

90
00:04:06,463 --> 00:04:09,128
Those are the symbols
for danger and death.

91
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:11,671
You mean like a curse?

92
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,180
Curse, legend,

93
00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:15,272
lore.

94
00:04:15,565 --> 00:04:17,337
I mean, this tomb has it all.

95
00:04:17,565 --> 00:04:20,086
Inside, a doomed queen lies

96
00:04:20,673 --> 00:04:22,444
shrouded in the cloud of darkness.

97
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:25,679
A queen who vows to one day rise again.

98
00:04:27,102 --> 00:04:29,272
I think I just gave myself the chills.

99
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:33,045
I am really,

100
00:04:33,254 --> 00:04:34,360
really sorry,

101
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:37,119
but these people have a job to do.

102
00:04:37,732 --> 00:04:39,907
And I don't wanna have to take you in.

103
00:04:42,506 --> 00:04:43,506
Fine.

104
00:04:44,238 --> 00:04:45,997
I've conveyed their warning.

105
00:04:47,502 --> 00:04:49,023
I strongly suggest...

106
00:04:49,609 --> 00:04:50,626
that you listen.

107
00:04:56,097 --> 00:04:57,049
I warned you.

108
00:04:57,925 --> 00:04:59,719
Thank you.
I knew I could count on you.

109
00:04:59,948 --> 00:05:01,224
Oh, just be careful.

110
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:04,386
It's all fun and games
till someone gets cursed.

111
00:05:12,951 --> 00:05:14,108
Heard you were back.

112
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,794
Yeah, just trying...

113
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,082
to catch up on everything.

114
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:25,995
You sure you're ready?
I mean, it's only been a couple weeks.

115
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:28,112
Yeah, I'm fine.

116
00:05:29,554 --> 00:05:31,629
Keeping busy, you know, it helps.

117
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:34,754
But I appreciate you
checking in on me.

118
00:05:34,914 --> 00:05:35,881
Listen...

119
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:40,885
I have something for you, but
I'm not sure if now is the right time.

120
00:05:41,164 --> 00:05:42,262
What is it?

121
00:05:43,504 --> 00:05:44,494
It's...

122
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,773
a wedding present from Stark...

123
00:05:49,685 --> 00:05:50,578
He...

124
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,685
asked me to give it to you.

125
00:05:57,345 --> 00:05:58,361
I could've waited.

126
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:00,582
No, it's...

127
00:06:02,851 --> 00:06:03,851
Thanks.

128
00:06:53,477 --> 00:06:55,288
<i>Power sequence initiated.</i>

129
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,858
<i>Metasomatic ray activated.</i>

130
00:07:13,027 --> 00:07:14,757
<i>Tomb pressure equalized.</i>

131
00:07:33,511 --> 00:07:36,792
Now the tomb has been
untouched for 3,000 years.

132
00:07:37,275 --> 00:07:39,548
Now, we must take great care

133
00:07:39,818 --> 00:07:41,136
to protect this holy site

134
00:07:41,256 --> 00:07:43,090
from being contaminated
by our presence.

135
00:07:43,725 --> 00:07:46,734
To ensure that Queen Nyota's body

136
00:07:46,921 --> 00:07:50,116
and spirit are preserved forever.

137
00:07:50,953 --> 00:07:51,932
Come along.

138
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:55,140
Yes, yes, look at that.

139
00:07:58,406 --> 00:08:00,550
It's wondrous.
This is wondrous!

140
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,319
- Eileen, are you getting this?
- You stepped out of your light.

141
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:04,484
What?

142
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,530
Why didn't you say anything?

143
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,200
Look, we gotta start from the top.

144
00:08:10,081 --> 00:08:11,657
Is this guy for real?

145
00:08:11,936 --> 00:08:14,252
You have to admire anyone
who can bring the wonder

146
00:08:14,372 --> 00:08:16,877
of scientific discovery
to the masses.

147
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,466
Especially if the masses
will pay top dollar to see it?

148
00:08:20,882 --> 00:08:22,054
Doesn't hurt.

149
00:08:22,863 --> 00:08:24,914
We've just removed the cover.

150
00:08:25,514 --> 00:08:26,882
And there she is.

151
00:08:27,403 --> 00:08:30,137
Queen Nyota, entirely intact.

152
00:08:31,374 --> 00:08:34,683
<i>Now the linen that once enshrouded her
has completely dissolved,</i>

153
00:08:34,843 --> 00:08:36,440
but the queen herself

154
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:37,961
lives on...

155
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,444
in all her splendid glory.

156
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:43,375
Will the legend come true?

157
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:47,196
<i>Will the queen rise again
to walk the night?</i>

158
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,700
Only time will tell.

Fargo, I swear, if this a joke...

163
00:10:21,428 --> 00:10:24,037
It was the mummy queen,
and she tried to strangle me.

164
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:25,878
You've seen too many horror movies.

165
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:27,885
Hello?

166
00:10:30,733 --> 00:10:32,043
Any mummy home?

167
00:10:34,098 --> 00:10:38,097
We've desecrated her tomb and woke
her up, and now she's out for revenge.

168
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,787
Go find Zane!
He's the one you want.

169
00:10:41,553 --> 00:10:42,739
Relax, Fargo.

170
00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:46,833
You can't wake the dead
unless you play my sister's music.

171
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:55,656
Oh, God! Queen Nyota got him.

172
00:10:55,776 --> 00:10:57,062
No, it's Dr. Marx.

173
00:11:01,292 --> 00:11:02,475
He's alive.

174
00:11:03,586 --> 00:11:05,175
He's not the only one.

175
00:11:08,273 --> 00:11:10,954
The sarcophagus.
The mummy's gone.

176
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:29,942
Is that you?

177
00:11:31,162 --> 00:11:32,941
I will always love you.

178
00:11:41,755 --> 00:11:42,551
Okay.

179
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:05,642
- What happened?
- You passed out, Sebastian.

180
00:12:06,342 --> 00:12:07,854
Probably dehydration.

181
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,380
After two weeks in the desert

182
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,609
and all day in the tomb,
it's no surprise.

183
00:12:13,486 --> 00:12:15,112
Can I have some water, please?

184
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:17,906
Was it the mummy? Did you see her?

185
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:19,032
Fargo, come on.

186
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:21,910
Oh, no.
The mummy.

187
00:12:23,165 --> 00:12:25,386
- My queen is gone.
- Yeah.

188
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,666
So you don't know where she is?

189
00:12:30,547 --> 00:12:32,312
No.
I went to dinner.

190
00:12:33,307 --> 00:12:36,008
When I came back to get more footage,
the sarcophagus was empty.

191
00:12:37,001 --> 00:12:39,344
It must've been your egyptologist,
Wilding.

192
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:43,181
- We have to get her back.
- I'm telling you, it's the curse.

193
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:46,386
Fargo says that he saw
the mummy in...

194
00:12:46,814 --> 00:12:48,312
Stark's memorial hallway.

195
00:12:48,472 --> 00:12:51,406
It has nothing to do with that.
I know what I saw.

196
00:12:51,526 --> 00:12:53,400
The queen is alive,
and I'm gonna prove it.

197
00:12:57,789 --> 00:12:59,244
Marx accused me.

198
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,985
You should arrest him for slander.

199
00:13:02,105 --> 00:13:03,910
Well, you did make quite a scene.

200
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,539
Disturbing Queen Nyota's remains
goes against everything I stand for.

201
00:13:07,894 --> 00:13:09,374
Yeah, and yet Marx did it anyway.

202
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,627
That doesn't mean I'd resort
to desecration to make my point.

203
00:13:13,338 --> 00:13:15,839
I respect the ancient Egyptians
far too much for that.

204
00:13:16,597 --> 00:13:18,285
You know they're dead, right?

205
00:13:18,405 --> 00:13:21,415
They're the first scientists and should
be honored for their achievements,

206
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,180
not turned into a circus sideshow.

207
00:13:24,815 --> 00:13:28,071
Okay, well, what can you tell me
about Sebastian Marx?

208
00:13:28,311 --> 00:13:29,644
It's not even his real name.

209
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,066
It's Paco Lopez. And he's been involved
in more than one scandal.

210
00:13:35,004 --> 00:13:38,205
I'll say. "Bribing customs officials.

211
00:13:38,325 --> 00:13:41,750
"Transporting sacred relics
without proper permits.

212
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,140
"Tomb raiding."

213
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:46,161
Marx sold out long ago.

214
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:48,724
He cares about the spectacle,

215
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:50,903
not science.

216
00:13:51,243 --> 00:13:55,049
Well, a resurrected mummy would build
a lot of hype for his little movie.

217
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:57,047
I wouldn't put it past him.

218
00:13:57,288 --> 00:13:59,090
Yeah, but a mummy hoax?

219
00:13:59,418 --> 00:14:01,259
Fargo said that he saw something.

220
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:03,989
Fargo is afraid of his own shadow.

221
00:14:04,324 --> 00:14:05,806
Given his state of mind...

222
00:14:05,966 --> 00:14:07,891
Yeah, but still,
we should talk to Marx again.

223
00:14:08,451 --> 00:14:10,769
Well, he's doing a book signing
at Café Diem.

224
00:14:11,334 --> 00:14:14,200
It's part of Vincent's
pharaoh-palooza event.

225
00:14:14,444 --> 00:14:15,537
All right.

226
00:14:17,984 --> 00:14:19,344
Pharaoh-palooza?

227
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:22,470
Is nothing sacred?

228
00:14:31,741 --> 00:14:33,388
Greetings, fellow Egyptians.

229
00:14:33,508 --> 00:14:35,316
Enjoy this nectar of the Nile.

230
00:14:35,754 --> 00:14:36,979
Thank you, Pharaoh.

231
00:14:37,099 --> 00:14:38,755
Nice costume.
So where's Marx?

232
00:14:39,406 --> 00:14:42,092
 Good question. He's an hour
late for his own booking signing.

233
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,386
Oh, celebrities can be
such prima donnas.

234
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,846
Mmm... is this coffee?

235
00:14:47,138 --> 00:14:50,475
- With pomegranate creamer in it.
- It's pharaoh-licious.

236
00:14:50,635 --> 00:14:51,939
It's disgusting.

237
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,896
Can I get some real milk,
like from a cow?

238
00:14:55,056 --> 00:14:57,816
Absolutely.
I shall resurrect some from the tomb.

239
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,987
That would be the freezer.

240
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,903
- I love theme day.
- Sheriff,

241
00:15:02,253 --> 00:15:03,989
prepare to be proven wrong.

242
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:06,402
- Are you drinking this?
- Uh...

243
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,244
- no, enjoy.
- Is that blood?

244
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:12,664
Fish blood. Herring, to be exact.

245
00:15:12,994 --> 00:15:14,541
Fargo, people are trying to eat.

246
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:17,961
The cells were found in a fossil pocket
in the paleontology lab.

247
00:15:18,275 --> 00:15:20,922
- They're thousands of years old.
- So it's dead fish blood.

248
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:22,757
Not dead, regenerated.

249
00:15:23,021 --> 00:15:25,552
A geology experiment brought
the cells back to life.

250
00:15:25,869 --> 00:15:27,137
Oh, but how, you ask?

251
00:15:27,939 --> 00:15:29,098
Metasomatic rays.

252
00:15:29,218 --> 00:15:31,568
Just like they used to open the tomb.

253
00:15:31,803 --> 00:15:34,936
And you think a few fish cells proves
that the mummy was resurrected.

254
00:15:35,096 --> 00:15:37,019
You can't ignore the evidence, Sheriff.

255
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:39,009
Here, take a closer look. They're alive.

256
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:41,617
- And they smell.
- Yeah, I'm gonna be sick.

257
00:15:42,244 --> 00:15:43,594
Oh, scratch that.

258
00:15:44,721 --> 00:15:45,947
Now I'm gonna be sick.

259
00:15:46,107 --> 00:15:48,411
Hi, guys. Do you like it?
I have free copies.

260
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,286
- Did you compose this?
- Mm-hmm, it soothes the soul

261
00:15:51,446 --> 00:15:54,456
on a wide range of frequencies, and
there's a  lot of tension here.

262
00:15:54,722 --> 00:15:57,035
- Especially from that area.
- I'll say.

263
00:15:57,468 --> 00:15:59,526
Tell you what.
You want to relieve some stress?

264
00:15:59,646 --> 00:16:02,255
Talk to Fargo.
He's got some serious mummy issues.

265
00:16:02,536 --> 00:16:04,758
- Let's go see Marx at the B&B.
- Wait, take this.

266
00:16:05,046 --> 00:16:07,296
Take it for the drive. You need it.

267
00:16:08,337 --> 00:16:09,293
All right.

268
00:16:12,354 --> 00:16:14,392
So... tell me about your mother.

269
00:16:26,795 --> 00:16:28,521
You do nice work, Dr. Deacon.

270
00:16:30,925 --> 00:16:33,411
How's it going
with that missing mummy?

271
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:36,206
The Sheriff's on the case.
I'm sure she'll be home soon.

272
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:38,194
Anything I can do to help,
just let me know.

273
00:16:38,314 --> 00:16:40,181
Actually, there is one thing.

274
00:16:41,551 --> 00:16:43,088
Do you have any idea what this is?

275
00:16:47,646 --> 00:16:48,750
A cryptex.

276
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,669
It's like a type of combination lock.

277
00:16:53,373 --> 00:16:56,101
Although I don't recognize the symbols.

278
00:16:56,381 --> 00:16:59,562
- Do you think you could open it?
- Where did you find this?

279
00:17:00,116 --> 00:17:02,649
In an alternate location
for the hotel I want to build.

280
00:17:03,727 --> 00:17:05,833
First it's baryogenic radiation,

281
00:17:05,953 --> 00:17:07,649
and now it's this.

282
00:17:09,211 --> 00:17:10,615
What are you looking for?

283
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,661
Unfortunately,
the details are classified.

284
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:19,026
That is unfortunate.

285
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:25,031
So I guess I'm gonna have
to find another way.

286
00:17:41,253 --> 00:17:44,065
Marx has been staying here
since he got to town.

287
00:17:44,515 --> 00:17:46,972
Dr. Marx, it's Sheriff Carter!

288
00:17:47,444 --> 00:17:48,709
You sure he's in there?

289
00:17:48,829 --> 00:17:51,346
No one's seen him leave
since he came in last night.

290
00:17:51,466 --> 00:17:54,589
- He say anything?
- No, just asked for some water.

291
00:18:01,141 --> 00:18:02,306
How much water?

292
00:18:16,157 --> 00:18:17,718
This place is a sauna.

293
00:18:19,991 --> 00:18:21,277
More like a tomb.

294
00:18:27,612 --> 00:18:29,462
I think we found our mummy.

295
00:18:32,182 --> 00:18:33,656
That's not our mummy.

296
00:18:35,534 --> 00:18:36,584
That's Marx.

297
00:18:49,524 --> 00:18:52,432
- Is Sebastian really dead?
- Really dead.

298
00:18:52,552 --> 00:18:55,595
I'm afraid he makes
Queen Tyota look good.

299
00:18:55,755 --> 00:18:57,263
Nyota.
What happened?

300
00:18:57,574 --> 00:19:00,627
We don't know yet. Henry's quarantined
the body while he does an autopsy.

301
00:19:00,747 --> 00:19:03,144
Quarantined?
Does he think this is an infection?

302
00:19:03,304 --> 00:19:06,439
The rapid deterioration of the body
is similar to flesh-eating bacteria.

303
00:19:07,082 --> 00:19:09,942
Sebastian just got back from Egypt.
Maybe he picked something up there.

304
00:19:10,398 --> 00:19:12,047
Or from the tomb

305
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:14,364
with the fancy "danger" signs
on the door.

306
00:19:14,524 --> 00:19:16,892
Maybe we should've listened to Wilding.

307
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:19,057
Anything?

308
00:19:20,696 --> 00:19:23,583
The body is severely drained
of all its fluids.

309
00:19:24,776 --> 00:19:27,668
Well, how do you die of dehydration
in a tub full of water?

310
00:19:28,068 --> 00:19:30,561
Aggressive bacterial infection.

311
00:19:30,681 --> 00:19:32,006
Fungal spores, poison.

312
00:19:32,231 --> 00:19:34,478
Poison?
So this could've been deliberate?

313
00:19:34,598 --> 00:19:36,761
Because Dr. Wilding
was very upset yesterday.

314
00:19:37,085 --> 00:19:40,715
No, it wasn't him. I spoke to him.
It's... it's not in his nature.

315
00:19:40,835 --> 00:19:43,097
And more than likely
it's spread through contact.

316
00:19:43,217 --> 00:19:45,228
If it had been airborne,
we would've seen victims.

317
00:19:45,388 --> 00:19:48,242
- Was anyone else in the tomb with him?
- Just his camerawoman,

318
00:19:48,362 --> 00:19:50,441
and I haven't heard from her
since yesterday.

319
00:19:50,601 --> 00:19:53,528
- Jo and I are on it.
- What about the missing mummy?

320
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:57,073
Shouldn't we be more concerned
about who killed your friend?

321
00:19:57,233 --> 00:19:59,305
That's my only concern, Sheriff.

322
00:19:59,563 --> 00:20:01,911
If the mummy's infectious,
more lives are at risk.

323
00:20:02,212 --> 00:20:04,247
We've already lost
one great scientist today.

324
00:20:04,407 --> 00:20:06,415
I don't want to lose another.

325
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,317
Excuse me.

326
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:10,795
Oh, dear.

327
00:20:33,585 --> 00:20:34,986
I will never leave you again.

328
00:20:43,658 --> 00:20:45,078
Allison, are you all right?

329
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:48,504
Yeah, I'm...
I just thought I...

330
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:52,339
Yeah, I'm fine.
Sorry.

331
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,459
Listen...

332
00:20:54,709 --> 00:20:56,652
I know what you're going through.

333
00:20:56,772 --> 00:20:58,513
I lost my husband too.

334
00:20:59,762 --> 00:21:02,409
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It was a long time ago.

335
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:05,588
But still, I know how difficult it is.

336
00:21:06,522 --> 00:21:08,561
And there'll always be reminders.

337
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:11,772
And the hard truth is,

338
00:21:12,296 --> 00:21:14,400
you can get past it,
but you'll never get over it,

339
00:21:14,709 --> 00:21:16,777
even if you have
all the time in the world.

340
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:20,656
I just want you to know
you're not alone.

341
00:21:24,786 --> 00:21:25,708
Thanks.

342
00:21:28,123 --> 00:21:31,207
Marx's camerawoman, Eileen Michaels.
Professional documentarian.

343
00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:33,274
She's been with Marx
for the entire excavation.

344
00:21:33,394 --> 00:21:35,607
- You haven't seen her since yesterday?
- She left early.

345
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:39,023
- Said she wasn't feeling well.
- She never made it back to the hotel.

346
00:21:39,143 --> 00:21:41,719
Can you see when she logged out
of the building?

347
00:21:46,727 --> 00:21:48,222
She... didn't.

348
00:21:48,342 --> 00:21:50,713
According to security,
she's still here.

349
00:21:51,842 --> 00:21:53,635
Let's hope she hasn't
ended up like Marx.

350
00:21:53,755 --> 00:21:55,149
About that.

351
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:59,214
I've been doing some research.
These are hieroglyphics from the tomb.

352
00:21:59,334 --> 00:22:02,948
They're an obscure dialect,
but I think they're describing a plague.

353
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:06,619
- You mean like a disease?
- Maybe he got infected inside the tomb.

354
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:10,959
Call Wilding, we need to know what
the symbols mean. I'll look for Eileen.

355
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,508
Not to be all doom and gloom,

356
00:22:12,628 --> 00:22:15,616
but if she's still alive,
wouldn't someone have seen her by now?

357
00:22:15,736 --> 00:22:17,441
Maybe someone already has.

358
00:22:20,524 --> 00:22:22,429
Okay, show me where she was.

359
00:22:22,857 --> 00:22:25,351
Right over there, but I don't think
we should be in here.

360
00:22:25,471 --> 00:22:26,889
What if the mummy comes back?

361
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,766
I don't think that's what you saw.

362
00:22:29,818 --> 00:22:31,644
Well, you said you believed me.

363
00:22:32,021 --> 00:22:34,651
No, I believe you saw someone
last night,

364
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:38,442
but just not the walking dead
out for revenge.

365
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:40,444
Tell that to Dr. Marx.

366
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,781
Henry hasn't finished the autopsy,
but it seems

367
00:22:42,901 --> 00:22:44,615
that Dr. Marx
was killed by an infection.

368
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,590
Some kind of dehydration sickness.

369
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,909
So it makes...

370
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:55,278
- You need... water.
- What are you... Don't go in there!

371
00:22:55,398 --> 00:22:56,713
It's not done yet!

372
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:04,169
This looks bad.

373
00:23:05,297 --> 00:23:06,846
You're not getting the full effect.

374
00:23:07,006 --> 00:23:10,850
You gotta imagine colored lights,
and pink water lilies, some koi.

375
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,310
- I don't think you want to see this.
- What?

376
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,026
It's the mummy queen!

377
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:22,270
No.

378
00:23:23,488 --> 00:23:25,132
It's Eileen Michaels.

379
00:23:26,981 --> 00:23:30,361
Well, the camerawoman was here
all along.

380
00:23:32,395 --> 00:23:34,664
- She was in the fountain.
- She must've gotten in there

381
00:23:34,784 --> 00:23:37,713
after Fargo ran,
like Marx in the bathtub.

382
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,271
That curse got her.
We're all doomed.

383
00:23:40,582 --> 00:23:42,798
For the last time,
there is no curse.

384
00:23:43,252 --> 00:23:45,968
- Then where's the mummy queen?
- I'm working on it.

385
00:23:48,281 --> 00:23:52,053
I'm ordering tests on all GD employees,
make sure no one else is infected.

386
00:23:52,173 --> 00:23:53,784
Well, she and Marx
were the only ones

387
00:23:53,904 --> 00:23:56,026
who actually had physical
contact with the mummy.

388
00:23:56,146 --> 00:23:57,813
That we know of.
Someone took her.

389
00:23:58,082 --> 00:24:00,983
Who knows how many people are at risk?
How many more people are gonna die?

390
00:24:01,207 --> 00:24:01,907
Okay.

391
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,280
Okay, well, we'll do the tests.
We'll keep our eyes open for the signs.

392
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:08,282
And what are the signs, exactly?

393
00:24:08,963 --> 00:24:10,038
I don't...

394
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,703
Being really, really thirsty?

395
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:16,506
So that's what we're depending on?
People are dying, Carter!

396
00:24:16,773 --> 00:24:17,666
Are you okay?

397
00:24:19,911 --> 00:24:23,278
- I'm fine. It's...
- Come on, talk to me.

398
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:28,212
I know this is gonna sound crazy,
but I swear I keep hearing...

399
00:24:31,796 --> 00:24:32,598
What?

400
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:37,394
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

401
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:44,618
<i>I knew that stupid curse
would get me too.</i>

402
00:24:44,738 --> 00:24:46,737
Don't worry, Fargo.
We're gonna take care of you.

403
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:50,398
<i>Oh, sure, like you took care
of Dr. Marx and Eileen Michaels?</i>

404
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:52,771
You're not gonna end up like that.

405
00:24:53,733 --> 00:24:54,995
How did he get infected?

406
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:58,173
Apparently Eileen touched him
on the neck before he ran off.

407
00:24:58,293 --> 00:25:00,675
We're checking everyone
that Fargo came into contact with first.

408
00:25:00,795 --> 00:25:02,547
Make sure no one else
has any symptoms.

409
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:06,132
Wilding and Zane are trying to learn
all they can from the symbols.

410
00:25:06,252 --> 00:25:08,001
- That's gonna take time.
- Where's Henry?

411
00:25:08,121 --> 00:25:09,918
He's doing an autopsy
of Eileen Michaels,

412
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:12,377
but if that doesn't provide
some answers, we're in trouble.

413
00:25:12,497 --> 00:25:13,879
Let's hope it does.

414
00:25:33,548 --> 00:25:35,994
She just disintegrated
before I could even get started.

415
00:25:36,154 --> 00:25:38,940
Without water to keep her hydrated,
her body just turned to dust.

416
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,235
- That didn't happen to Marx.
- No, he was different.

417
00:25:41,355 --> 00:25:43,738
I found hundreds of small
masses inside his stomach,

418
00:25:43,858 --> 00:25:45,790
- growths of some kind.
- That's pleasant.

419
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,796
- Tumors?
- Not that I'd ever seen before.

420
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:50,916
- I'm gonna keep testing.
- Check Fargo's blood against Marx's.

421
00:25:51,036 --> 00:25:52,671
We have a couple hours to save him.

422
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:55,407
We need to find out what kind
of infection we're dealing with.

423
00:25:55,527 --> 00:25:57,753
I'll work on finding out
what the symbols to the tomb mean.

424
00:25:57,873 --> 00:26:00,365
Maybe there's a cure for the plague,
whatever it is.

425
00:26:00,485 --> 00:26:01,603
All right.

426
00:26:03,031 --> 00:26:04,107
Any progress?

427
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:05,546
Some.

428
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:07,283
See, every language has its pattern.

429
00:26:07,403 --> 00:26:09,538
It's just a matter
of cracking the code.

430
00:26:09,658 --> 00:26:11,254
Zane's been filling in the blanks

431
00:26:11,374 --> 00:26:13,163
where the symbols have
faded over time.

432
00:26:13,283 --> 00:26:15,422
- I've always been a puzzle guy.
- Well done.

433
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:19,037
So, did queen what's-her-name
die from this?

434
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:20,116
No.

435
00:26:20,862 --> 00:26:24,798
The high priests apparently
killed her themselves

436
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:27,166
to save her from the plague.

437
00:26:27,698 --> 00:26:29,506
Not exactly a cure
we can use on Fargo.

438
00:26:29,957 --> 00:26:31,842
There's still pieces
that we don't understand.

439
00:26:32,496 --> 00:26:35,095
Like this symbol.
It keeps popping up over and over again.

440
00:26:35,255 --> 00:26:37,120
That looks like a few clouds.

441
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:40,553
I don't understand who could've taken
the queen without anybody noticing.

442
00:26:40,673 --> 00:26:42,853
There's nothing on the video.
No security breach.

443
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:45,672
It's like she vanished
into thin air.

444
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:49,148
Maybe because she did.

445
00:26:51,674 --> 00:26:53,540
I think the reason
why we can't figure out

446
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,867
where the queen went is because
she's been right here all along.

447
00:27:07,807 --> 00:27:09,367
<i>Well, this is different.</i>

448
00:27:13,224 --> 00:27:15,129
<i>Potassium, 35%.</i>

449
00:27:15,606 --> 00:27:17,158
<i>Carbon, 18%.</i>

450
00:27:17,915 --> 00:27:19,681
<i>Phosphorous, 1.0.</i>

451
00:27:20,441 --> 00:27:23,310
<i>Calcium... 1.5.</i>

452
00:27:24,355 --> 00:27:26,004
<i>Sheriff, you're right.</i>

453
00:27:26,731 --> 00:27:29,229
<i>It's all organic matter.
It's human remains.</i>

454
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,736
How did you know?

455
00:27:30,856 --> 00:27:33,266
Henry said that Eileen
had turned to dust.

456
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:36,217
I figured
maybe the queen had as well.

457
00:27:37,121 --> 00:27:38,575
If you'd only heeded the warning.

458
00:27:38,975 --> 00:27:42,815
Well, at least nobody else had contact
with her. So this should be contained.

459
00:27:43,293 --> 00:27:44,108
Yeah.

460
00:27:44,965 --> 00:27:46,041
To Fargo.

461
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:52,254
<i>How do I look?</i>

462
00:27:55,134 --> 00:27:57,369
<i>Is that supposed to cheer me up?</i>

463
00:27:59,204 --> 00:28:00,389
Just hang in there.

464
00:28:00,718 --> 00:28:04,108
I mean, Henry's still working on it,
and we haven't given up.

465
00:28:04,228 --> 00:28:05,644
Neither should you.

466
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:14,364
I though you said
rehydrating him would help.

467
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:17,280
It should, but the more fluids
we give him, the weaker he gets.

468
00:28:17,593 --> 00:28:19,669
- All right, if you stop?
- He dies of dehydration.

469
00:28:19,789 --> 00:28:22,202
Here, look at his blood.
These are microbes.

470
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:25,077
They're replicating
at an incredible rate.

471
00:28:25,197 --> 00:28:27,207
They look like...
little bugs.

472
00:28:27,453 --> 00:28:30,311
It's not like any bacteria
I've ever encountered.

473
00:28:32,956 --> 00:28:35,410
What if we're thinking
of the wrong kind of plague?

474
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:36,864
What do you mean?

475
00:28:37,261 --> 00:28:39,857
Well, so far we've been thinking
about the disease kind.

476
00:28:39,977 --> 00:28:42,431
What if it's...
an insect kind?

477
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,726
You think Fargo's been invaded
by microscopic insects?

478
00:28:45,886 --> 00:28:49,743
Well, he showed me this fish blood
that had been regenerated

479
00:28:49,863 --> 00:28:51,481
by a meta-whatever ray.

480
00:28:51,641 --> 00:28:53,650
Could the same thing happen
to some ancient bug?

481
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:56,862
Well, under certain conditions,
insects can enter cryptobiosis.

482
00:28:57,197 --> 00:28:59,303
It's a natural state
of suspended animation.

483
00:28:59,477 --> 00:29:01,700
They can survive
indefinitely until rehydrated.

484
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:04,536
Like... like sea monkeys?

485
00:29:04,979 --> 00:29:06,706
Same principle.

486
00:29:07,978 --> 00:29:11,128
Which explains why rehydrating Fargo
is making him worse.

487
00:29:11,468 --> 00:29:13,192
The insects are multiplying.

488
00:29:13,312 --> 00:29:17,007
And if they're exposed to a large amount
of water, like an overflowing bathtub?

489
00:29:17,265 --> 00:29:20,886
It could speed metamorphosis, like
a caterpillar turning into a butterfly.

490
00:29:21,461 --> 00:29:23,889
Okay, take care of Fargo.
I gotta warn Henry.

491
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:36,401
Henry, I need to talk to you
for a second.

492
00:29:57,795 --> 00:30:01,104
Hey, we need to lock down that tent,
make sure nothing can get out.

493
00:30:01,224 --> 00:30:04,532
Well, nothing can. It's designed
to contain the tiniest of microbes.

494
00:30:04,652 --> 00:30:06,186
What about something bigger?

495
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:07,556
How much bigger?

496
00:30:17,571 --> 00:30:18,621
Quite a bit.

497
00:30:28,129 --> 00:30:30,479
Why couldn't it have been butterflies?

498
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:39,937
Jo, keep everyone inside.
They're heading your way.

499
00:30:40,057 --> 00:30:42,801
- There's nothing left of Marx.
- Except what's flying towards town.

500
00:30:42,921 --> 00:30:45,302
Let's get back to GD.
We can't do this alone.

501
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:48,056
It's a swarm.
That's what the cloud stands for.

502
00:30:48,216 --> 00:30:50,110
Yeah, what kind of threat is it?

503
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,432
The bugs lay eggs,

504
00:30:51,552 --> 00:30:53,993
hatch larvae,
and then seek out new hosts.

505
00:30:54,113 --> 00:30:54,813
Us.

506
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,525
How did the ancient Egyptians
deal with the problem?

507
00:30:58,889 --> 00:31:01,778
They killed the infected
and burned their city to the ground.

508
00:31:02,522 --> 00:31:04,172
Let's call that plan B.

509
00:31:04,442 --> 00:31:06,416
According to our guys in entomology,
these bugs

510
00:31:06,536 --> 00:31:09,123
are gonna grow exponentially
now that they've emerged.

511
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:12,539
Hold on, how could the bugs
grow in Marx but not Eileen?

512
00:31:13,153 --> 00:31:14,358
Probably incubation.

513
00:31:14,478 --> 00:31:16,521
To fully develop,
the larvae need water.

514
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:19,337
They were both in water.
Eileen in the fountain, Marx in the tub.

515
00:31:19,497 --> 00:31:21,869
Maybe there was something
in the fountain that killed the larvae

516
00:31:21,989 --> 00:31:23,675
before they could
undergo metamorphosis.

517
00:31:24,035 --> 00:31:25,455
I'll go test the water.

518
00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:28,461
Sorry.

519
00:31:30,283 --> 00:31:34,133
Hey, Zo, just stay in doors.
We got a little bit of a bug problem.

520
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,895
A little bug problem?

521
00:31:36,249 --> 00:31:38,499
Stay away from the windows, people!

522
00:31:39,326 --> 00:31:41,476
Looks pretty big from where I am.

523
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:44,152
What happened to lights?

524
00:31:44,272 --> 00:31:46,031
They must've gotten
to the circuit breaker.

525
00:31:46,151 --> 00:31:47,824
Can't hear you.
Can you turn that down?

526
00:31:47,984 --> 00:31:49,284
Aunt Lex, kill the boombox.

527
00:31:51,751 --> 00:31:53,601
The bug swarm is huge and...

528
00:31:58,368 --> 00:31:59,518
It's leaving.

529
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:04,716
Turn it back on.
Tell Lex to turn the music back on.

530
00:32:04,876 --> 00:32:06,469
Dad wants the music back on.

531
00:32:06,589 --> 00:32:08,239
I knew he'd come around.

532
00:32:15,303 --> 00:32:17,953
It's weird. They're...
They're coming back.

533
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:22,079
Okay, keep the doors closed,
keep the music on, and hang tight.

534
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,445
It's Lexi's music.
The bugs actually like it.

535
00:32:27,565 --> 00:32:29,782
It could be the harmonic frequencies.

536
00:32:29,943 --> 00:32:32,389
Yeah, or they have no taste.
The point is that we can attract them.

537
00:32:32,509 --> 00:32:34,297
How do we kill 'em
before they lay any eggs?

538
00:32:34,417 --> 00:32:36,122
Without gassing the town,
I have no idea.

539
00:32:36,282 --> 00:32:38,534
Even then they could be resistant
to traditional pesticides.

540
00:32:38,654 --> 00:32:40,684
All right, what killed
the bugs in Eileen Michaels?

541
00:32:40,804 --> 00:32:43,671
- Did you test the fountain?
- Purified water. Not even chlorine.

542
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:46,591
Well, what about the pH levels?
Oxygenation, alkalinity?

543
00:32:46,751 --> 00:32:48,802
All completely normal.
Just regular H2O.

544
00:32:48,962 --> 00:32:51,221
I mean, no different than the water
that Marx was found in.

545
00:32:53,231 --> 00:32:55,281
No, Marx was found in hot water.

546
00:32:55,876 --> 00:32:57,509
The bathroom was filled with steam.

547
00:32:57,629 --> 00:33:01,105
Yeah, but the fountain water comes from
an underground spring. It's ice cold.

548
00:33:01,265 --> 00:33:04,400
So maybe the bugs can't take the cold?

549
00:33:04,674 --> 00:33:07,024
That's a reasonable hypothesis, and...

550
00:33:07,461 --> 00:33:09,711
we have the perfect way to test it.

551
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,165
Save Fargo, save the town.

552
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:15,965
Wait.

553
00:33:16,493 --> 00:33:17,843
It's okay, Fargo.

554
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,041
Maybe for you.

555
00:33:20,201 --> 00:33:22,151
Just let us take care of you.

556
00:33:24,103 --> 00:33:26,153
The anesthesia's taking effect.

557
00:33:27,192 --> 00:33:27,942
And...

558
00:33:29,161 --> 00:33:30,111
he's out.

559
00:33:30,673 --> 00:33:31,678
We're ready.

560
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:35,485
Okay, his vitals are really weak,
so let's take it slow.

561
00:33:35,902 --> 00:33:38,145
Starting cryo-freeze...

562
00:33:38,893 --> 00:33:39,700
Now.

563
00:33:45,981 --> 00:33:47,442
How long till we know?

564
00:33:47,749 --> 00:33:51,613
Until I can confirm all the larvae
inside of him have been frozen to death?

565
00:33:52,748 --> 00:33:53,598
Will...

566
00:33:55,017 --> 00:33:56,369
Will he be all right?

567
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,539
If he doesn't freeze to death first.

568
00:34:08,827 --> 00:34:11,509
Internal sensors are
still detecting movement.

569
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:18,384
Okay, almost there.

570
00:34:25,243 --> 00:34:26,566
No more movement.

571
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:27,984
They're dead?

572
00:34:28,836 --> 00:34:30,341
Or they could just be hibernating?

573
00:34:30,461 --> 00:34:32,739
That's what we're gonna find out.
Bring Fargo out.

574
00:34:35,711 --> 00:34:37,869
Defrost sequence...

575
00:34:38,393 --> 00:34:39,343
Underway.

576
00:34:45,787 --> 00:34:47,537
Pulse rate not responding.

577
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,170
Fargo, don't you die on me.

578
00:34:54,545 --> 00:34:55,795
Still no change.

579
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,452
Wait.

580
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:01,114
Wait a minute.

581
00:35:01,348 --> 00:35:02,798
Pulse rate... 45...

582
00:35:05,553 --> 00:35:06,540
53...

583
00:35:09,017 --> 00:35:11,069
Normal rate and rhythm.
He's coming back to us.

584
00:35:13,315 --> 00:35:14,447
Still no movement.

585
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,570
That's it.

586
00:35:16,811 --> 00:35:17,784
They're dead!

587
00:35:19,426 --> 00:35:21,362
So... he's okay?

588
00:35:23,601 --> 00:35:25,590
I swear I almost lost it there
for a moment.

589
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,460
Yeah.

590
00:35:29,908 --> 00:35:31,047
And now I have.

591
00:35:31,781 --> 00:35:33,431
I will always love you.

592
00:35:36,698 --> 00:35:37,848
I see him too.

593
00:35:38,431 --> 00:35:39,281
So do I.

594
00:35:39,545 --> 00:35:41,557
When you moved your hand
from your necklace.

595
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,394
Is that a logic diamond?

596
00:35:47,866 --> 00:35:50,686
Yeah, yeah it is.
Stark had it made for her.

597
00:35:51,905 --> 00:35:53,855
Of course, I should've known.

598
00:35:59,582 --> 00:36:01,201
I will always love you.

599
00:36:04,459 --> 00:36:06,499
Then it's a holographic projection

600
00:36:06,659 --> 00:36:09,210
activated by certain spectra of light.

601
00:36:09,809 --> 00:36:12,559
Nathan must've programmed it
in the diamond.

602
00:36:13,609 --> 00:36:14,759
I didn't know.

603
00:36:16,782 --> 00:36:17,635
It's okay.

604
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,440
I'm in Heaven.

605
00:36:32,893 --> 00:36:35,026
Fargo's temperature is normal.

606
00:36:35,187 --> 00:36:36,730
- It worked.
- All right.

607
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,614
Let's get this working on the swarm.

608
00:36:38,774 --> 00:36:41,993
Freezing the bugs in Fargo is one thing,
but we can't freeze the whole town.

609
00:36:42,153 --> 00:36:43,954
Oh, we don't need the whole town.

610
00:36:44,074 --> 00:36:46,552
Just one really cold tomb.

611
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:56,257
Okay, Zane, plugging it in...

612
00:36:56,618 --> 00:36:57,481
<i>now.</i>

613
00:36:57,767 --> 00:37:00,303
Copy that. Everything
in a five-mile radius should hear it.

614
00:37:00,574 --> 00:37:01,791
<i>You don't have much time.</i>

615
00:37:01,911 --> 00:37:04,357
<i>If the bugs start to reproduce,
we'll never get them under control.</i>

616
00:37:04,477 --> 00:37:06,225
- Way ahead of you.
- <i>Good luck, Sheriff.</i>

617
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,360
Here they come.

618
00:37:21,143 --> 00:37:22,393
They're coming.

619
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,477
Door!

620
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:31,984
Door!

621
00:37:34,163 --> 00:37:35,110
Boombox!

622
00:37:36,393 --> 00:37:38,843
That's part of the plan?
Are you crazy?

623
00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:46,249
Everybody, hold on!

624
00:37:46,645 --> 00:37:47,892
Vince, freezer!

625
00:37:48,564 --> 00:37:49,514
I'm on it!

626
00:38:06,906 --> 00:38:07,995
That's all of them.

627
00:38:10,197 --> 00:38:11,082
Freeze 'em.

628
00:38:12,112 --> 00:38:15,484
Zero degrees Kelvin, baby.
Bless you, fusion reactor!

629
00:38:37,042 --> 00:38:40,092
- Everyone okay?
- A little creeped out, but fine.

630
00:38:40,337 --> 00:38:41,987
Yeah, but my food isn't.

631
00:38:42,382 --> 00:38:45,826
- I'm gonna need some grief counseling.
- Better that than being the food.

632
00:38:45,946 --> 00:38:46,996
That's true.

633
00:38:50,105 --> 00:38:52,748
- Not too shabby, bro.
- Yeah, not too shabby yourself.

634
00:38:52,908 --> 00:38:54,583
Does this mean that you like my music?

635
00:38:54,992 --> 00:38:57,294
I appreciate it on some level, yeah.

636
00:38:58,313 --> 00:38:59,864
Well, I'm glad you guys made up,

637
00:38:59,984 --> 00:39:02,508
because if you think I'm cleaning
that freezer all on my own,

638
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,593
you are sadly mistaken.

639
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:15,703
Welcome back.

640
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:17,356
How you feeling?

641
00:39:18,366 --> 00:39:20,616
Like I just came back from the dead.

642
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,111
It was close.

643
00:39:23,178 --> 00:39:24,934
I saw a bright light...

644
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:26,782
and Dr. Stark.

645
00:39:27,501 --> 00:39:28,868
He's okay, Dr. Blake.

646
00:39:29,986 --> 00:39:31,636
You don't have to worry.

647
00:39:33,345 --> 00:39:34,470
He's okay.

648
00:39:37,184 --> 00:39:38,434
I'm sure he is.

649
00:40:05,872 --> 00:40:08,722
They just finished sterilizing
the sarcophagus.

650
00:40:10,154 --> 00:40:11,046
Good.

651
00:40:13,767 --> 00:40:16,915
An outbreak on tour
would create terrible buzz.

652
00:40:18,078 --> 00:40:19,128
So to speak.

653
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,300
I have...

654
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:26,413
a new puzzle for you to solve.

655
00:40:27,863 --> 00:40:28,813
A cryptex.

656
00:40:29,435 --> 00:40:31,918
Yeah, I've read about these,
but I've never actually seen one.

657
00:40:32,038 --> 00:40:33,885
You think you can crack it?

658
00:40:34,005 --> 00:40:34,896
You kidding?

659
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:37,019
I broke into my dad's safe
when I was five.

660
00:40:37,179 --> 00:40:40,147
Well, then I picked
the right man for the job.

661
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:54,983
Are you sure you wanna do this?

662
00:40:56,604 --> 00:40:58,654
Well, Nathan left me a message.

663
00:41:02,581 --> 00:41:03,712
I need to hear it.

664
00:41:06,146 --> 00:41:07,257
You want me to stay?

665
00:41:10,325 --> 00:41:12,137
I think I need to do this by myself.

666
00:41:33,569 --> 00:41:34,519
Surprise.

667
00:41:36,109 --> 00:41:37,646
I know what you're thinking.

668
00:41:37,766 --> 00:41:41,416
"I can barely handle one Nathan.
What am I gonna do with two?"

669
00:41:42,221 --> 00:41:43,571
Well, don't worry.

670
00:41:44,384 --> 00:41:47,371
All I've done is imprint
a small part of myself

671
00:41:47,819 --> 00:41:48,924
onto this diamond.

672
00:41:49,938 --> 00:41:51,388
The way that you...

673
00:41:51,764 --> 00:41:53,514
have imprinted yourself...

674
00:41:54,528 --> 00:41:55,523
onto me.

675
00:41:57,547 --> 00:42:00,697
If marriage is about joining
two people for eternity,

676
00:42:01,402 --> 00:42:02,952
I wanted to be sure...

677
00:42:03,951 --> 00:42:06,001
that no matter where you are...

678
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,120
or where I am...

679
00:42:09,212 --> 00:42:10,962
I will always be with you.

680
00:42:13,607 --> 00:42:15,957
I made mistakes the first time, Ally.

681
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,670
I know that.

682
00:42:19,377 --> 00:42:20,827
But I promise you...

683
00:42:21,682 --> 00:42:22,732
this time...

684
00:42:24,618 --> 00:42:26,168
this time is forever.

685
00:42:29,593 --> 00:42:31,243
I will always love you.

686
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:33,135
And I will never,

687
00:42:34,895 --> 00:42:35,815
ever...

688
00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:38,103
leave you again.

689
00:42:47,686 --> 00:42:49,142
Goodbye, Nathan.
