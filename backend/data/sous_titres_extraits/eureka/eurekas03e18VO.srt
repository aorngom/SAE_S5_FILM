1
00:00:03,472 --> 00:00:05,518
- Morning, SARAH.
- <i>Good morning, Sheriff.</i>

2
00:00:05,643 --> 00:00:07,284
- <i>Coffee?</i>
- Yeah, two.

3
00:00:07,409 --> 00:00:09,925
- One black and one with milk and...
- <i>Three teaspoons of sugar.</i>

4
00:00:10,158 --> 00:00:11,405
<i>Yes, I know.</i>

5
00:00:11,988 --> 00:00:13,130
Good memory, SARAH.

6
00:00:13,255 --> 00:00:15,598
<i>I locked it in the system preferences
after the third night.</i>

7
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,558
Yeah, but not
that you're counting, right?

8
00:00:23,997 --> 00:00:26,192
I could do that all day.

9
00:00:26,584 --> 00:00:28,971
Call in sick.
I can write a note to your boss.

10
00:00:29,157 --> 00:00:32,076
- You are the boss.
- Yeah, temporarily.

11
00:00:32,655 --> 00:00:34,354
And as tempting as that sounds,

12
00:00:34,697 --> 00:00:36,952
we're testing this new
supercollider at GD today,

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,012
and if all goes well,

14
00:00:39,137 --> 00:00:41,410
we actually could prove
the existence of dark energy.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,076
That old bag.

16
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:46,754
That old bag is the key to understanding
the laws of the universe.

17
00:00:46,923 --> 00:00:47,952
You should come.

18
00:00:48,077 --> 00:00:50,174
It's gonna be quite a show.

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,009
Not the kind of show I care for.

20
00:00:52,408 --> 00:00:54,470
Okay, we can save that show
for later.

21
00:00:58,045 --> 00:00:59,603
Hands where I can see 'em.

22
00:01:00,468 --> 00:01:01,794
Good morning, Zoe.

23
00:01:03,537 --> 00:01:04,772
I should probably go.

24
00:01:05,345 --> 00:01:07,170
- I'll see you later?
- See you later.

25
00:01:07,295 --> 00:01:08,436
Have a good day.

26
00:01:13,268 --> 00:01:15,157
Go ahead.
I know it's killing you.

27
00:01:16,186 --> 00:01:17,368
No, she's adorable.

28
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:19,537
You can't give me grief about Lucas.

29
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:22,843
Yes, I can.
It's not the same thing.

30
00:01:24,544 --> 00:01:25,907
What's with the sweats?

31
00:01:26,032 --> 00:01:28,379
Dive meet at 1:00
for Pilar's biotech final.

32
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,089
Since when do you dive?

33
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,784
Since I stupidly agreed
to be her guinea pig.

34
00:01:33,717 --> 00:01:36,971
Novice divers controlled
by neural-muscle remote.

35
00:01:37,705 --> 00:01:40,794
- You don't have to come.
- Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss it.

36
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:42,685
My God.

37
00:01:43,768 --> 00:01:44,645
What's wrong?

38
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:48,083
I got offered early admission
to an undergrad pre-med program

39
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,206
at Harvard.

40
00:01:50,673 --> 00:01:53,041
You... that's fantas...

41
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:55,072
But that's not for, like, two years.

42
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:56,657
Everyone at Tesla applies early,

43
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:59,326
and they only accept
a few people for admission,

44
00:01:59,973 --> 00:02:01,262
and they picked me.

45
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:05,408
- But, I mean, you have a B- average.
- Which is like an A+ in the real world.

46
00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:08,210
And it's not all about GPA.
Someone wrote a letter on my behalf.

47
00:02:08,843 --> 00:02:09,628
They did?

48
00:02:10,086 --> 00:02:12,047
It starts next semester.

49
00:02:12,282 --> 00:02:13,533
Can you believe it?

50
00:02:15,277 --> 00:02:17,422
It's soon.

51
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,264
Are you okay, Sheriff? I'm picking up
a spike in your blood pressure.

52
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:22,391
I'm excited.
I'm freaked out. But I'm excited.

53
00:02:24,076 --> 00:02:25,458
- Thanks, dad.
- Yeah.

54
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,313
- I have to go call Lucas.
- Sure.

55
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:29,030
- It's amazing, right?
- Yeah.

56
00:02:29,155 --> 00:02:29,899
My God.

57
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:31,468
Yeah, it's...

58
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:33,624
huge.

59
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:36,405
It's devastating.

60
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:39,148
We were going to apply
to the same schools.

61
00:02:39,762 --> 00:02:42,870
She is a special candidate,
and there was only one spot.

62
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:45,795
- I'm special.
- Yes, you are.

63
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,493
But it's not just about IQs,

64
00:02:47,721 --> 00:02:49,877
and, besides, you know,
you can join her next year.

65
00:02:50,773 --> 00:02:52,619
This just wasn't part of the plan.

66
00:02:52,744 --> 00:02:54,841
Well, life rarely goes
according to plan.

67
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,236
I mean, take Kim's ship.

68
00:02:56,361 --> 00:02:57,869
I lose it 20 years ago.

69
00:02:57,994 --> 00:02:59,792
And it returns with enough data

70
00:02:59,917 --> 00:03:02,276
to unlock the secrets
of the universe,

71
00:03:02,401 --> 00:03:05,351
and I get to share it
with one of my best students.

72
00:03:06,342 --> 00:03:08,815
I appreciate the opportunity,
Dr. Deacon,

73
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,983
but all the data in the world can't take
the place of the woman you love.

74
00:03:16,373 --> 00:03:18,246
I'm sorry.
I meant Zoe and me and...

75
00:03:18,687 --> 00:03:19,490
It's okay.

76
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:20,468
Really.

77
00:03:24,077 --> 00:03:26,496
Check out the scan
of our solar system from Kim's data.

78
00:03:28,653 --> 00:03:31,585
Look at the distortion on
the northern edge of the heliosphere.

79
00:03:32,405 --> 00:03:34,213
Could that be what I think it is?

80
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:37,154
Nemesis.

81
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,828
- It's not the end of the world.
- Easy for you to say.

82
00:03:41,953 --> 00:03:44,968
This is an amazing opportunity.
You should be proud of her.

83
00:03:45,093 --> 00:03:46,717
I am proud.
I just got blindsided.

84
00:03:46,842 --> 00:03:48,936
I thought we had
another year together.

85
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,312
Fresh muffins.

86
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:52,514
- Get 'em while they're hot.
- I love muffin Monday.

87
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,922
I can't.

88
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:56,389
Sarah said that I have
to watch my blood pressure.

89
00:03:56,514 --> 00:03:59,229
The end of the world is coming.
The people have a right to know.

90
00:03:59,435 --> 00:04:01,657
And with you around,
it'll end sooner than later.

91
00:04:02,089 --> 00:04:03,904
And that doesn't help.

92
00:04:04,029 --> 00:04:06,654
You can't do this, Fargo.
It's putting us all at risk.

93
00:04:07,576 --> 00:04:09,914
- Who did what?
- It's what they're about to do.

94
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:12,793
Ignore him.
It's not us this time. It's Nemesis.

95
00:04:13,077 --> 00:04:14,029
Nemesis?

96
00:04:15,406 --> 00:04:18,883
Is that like a supervillain
from your fantasy justice league?

97
00:04:19,153 --> 00:04:20,153
Oh, it's real.

98
00:04:20,714 --> 00:04:22,772
And that is an awesome name.

99
00:04:23,703 --> 00:04:27,474
Nemesis is a neutron star theorized
to be in binary orbit with our sun.

100
00:04:27,746 --> 00:04:30,411
It crosses Earth's orbit
every 65 million years,

101
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,271
causing an extinction-level event.

102
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,064
Like a killer asteroid?

103
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:35,600
That's not even the half of it.

104
00:04:35,905 --> 00:04:38,068
The tidal stresses
from the star's gravitational pull

105
00:04:38,465 --> 00:04:40,622
could cause a sudden reversal
of Earth's magnetic poles

106
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,448
and unleash earthquakes, tsunamis,

107
00:04:43,003 --> 00:04:44,590
total global chaos.

108
00:04:44,715 --> 00:04:46,785
The world could literally be
turned upside-down.

109
00:04:47,782 --> 00:04:50,748
All right, I'll check with Henry.
How much time do we have?

110
00:04:50,965 --> 00:04:54,433
If we're lucky, maybe 2,000 years.

111
00:04:55,746 --> 00:04:56,900
2,000.

112
00:04:58,128 --> 00:05:00,821
See, that's not so much a problem,

113
00:05:00,946 --> 00:05:03,510
so next time, don't bury the lead.

114
00:05:03,852 --> 00:05:05,089
Exactly, kids.

115
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,764
Sheriff, the real problem here
is the supercollider

116
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:09,475
these guys are about to test.

117
00:05:09,653 --> 00:05:11,936
It'll wipe us out long before
nemesis gets the chance.

118
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:13,251
Histrionic much.

119
00:05:13,463 --> 00:05:16,523
That thing makes the hadron collider
at CERN look like a slingshot.

120
00:05:16,869 --> 00:05:19,735
Mark my words, some things
should not be messed with.

121
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,612
Like the laws of physics.

122
00:05:22,527 --> 00:05:24,929
For once, Larry makes a fair point.

123
00:05:27,397 --> 00:05:31,224
So the laws of physics are in peril,
my daughter's moving out,

124
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:34,091
and the world's coming to an end?

125
00:05:34,948 --> 00:05:37,378
I say, have the muffin.

126
00:05:39,664 --> 00:05:41,144
I'll have the muffin.

127
00:05:44,215 --> 00:05:48,150
Easy, Fargo, that's a $10 billion
piece of equipment.

128
00:05:48,275 --> 00:05:49,974
You break it, you buy it.

129
00:05:50,588 --> 00:05:53,310
All right, that's it.
Radio isotopes are in place.

130
00:05:53,731 --> 00:05:56,855
Ready to smash some unstable atoms
together at nearly the speed of light?

131
00:05:57,838 --> 00:06:01,235
You know, when he says it like that,
it doesn't sound like a good idea.

132
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:02,444
Okay, kids.

133
00:06:02,712 --> 00:06:03,712
Here we go.

134
00:06:06,336 --> 00:06:07,713
Isn't this exciting?

135
00:06:07,838 --> 00:06:09,150
If we find dark energy,

136
00:06:09,275 --> 00:06:11,495
we could prove the existence
of the Higgs boson,

137
00:06:11,891 --> 00:06:13,998
discover the nature
of quark-gluon interaction,

138
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,292
maybe even find
a true unification theory.

139
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,378
I love it when you talk nerdy to me.

140
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,269
Particle velocity is at 0.50c.

141
00:06:24,808 --> 00:06:25,993
.70.

142
00:06:28,024 --> 00:06:28,903
.80.

143
00:06:29,028 --> 00:06:30,806
Should we be wearing safety goggles?

144
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,933
Don't worry about it.
I'll protect you.

145
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:36,060
.9.

146
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,793
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

147
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:45,529
- The field sensors are off-scale.
- Power surge in the delivery arm.

148
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,990
Damping rings are destabilizing.

149
00:07:06,456 --> 00:07:07,509
Projet-SG (1.00)

150
00:07:12,797 --> 00:07:13,685
You okay?

151
00:07:15,128 --> 00:07:16,251
Everyone okay?

152
00:07:18,798 --> 00:07:20,769
Why are we talking
like chip and dale?

153
00:07:20,894 --> 00:07:23,405
Liquid helium cools the magnets
surrounding the collider tunnel.

154
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,319
- The ring hit the supply line.
- You think?

155
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,281
I'll shut off the line
and open the surface vents.

156
00:07:29,628 --> 00:07:31,366
I knew we
should have worn safety goggles.

157
00:07:32,054 --> 00:07:33,619
Safety goggles are good.

158
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:35,913
- Now what the hell happened?
- Fargo happened.

159
00:07:36,564 --> 00:07:37,858
My part went flawlessly.

160
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,941
You screwed up
the containment field calibration.

161
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:42,467
I checked them a dozen times.
They were spot on.

162
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,988
They're not now.
Yeah, take a look at that.

163
00:07:47,746 --> 00:07:49,009
This can't be right.

164
00:07:49,185 --> 00:07:51,595
There was a high-voltage spike
in the damping ring stabilizer.

165
00:07:52,694 --> 00:07:54,389
- And it just snapped?
- No way.

166
00:07:54,655 --> 00:07:56,557
The stabilizer unit, it's shielded.

167
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,352
Something or someone did this.

168
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,868
But this is a critical test
in proving the laws of physics.

169
00:08:00,993 --> 00:08:02,314
Who would want to stop it?

170
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,969
I think I might have an idea.

171
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:08,133
You can't say I didn't warn you.

172
00:08:08,258 --> 00:08:10,066
That's why we're here, Larry.

173
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:13,281
You think I messed with the collider?
Are you insane?

174
00:08:13,406 --> 00:08:14,625
Just following leads.

175
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,716
You seemed vocal
about wanting to shut it down.

176
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:18,834
Freedom of speech.

177
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:21,562
Just because I thought it was a stupid
idea doesn't mean I'd act on it.

178
00:08:21,687 --> 00:08:23,484
You did hijack Martha.

179
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,131
One tiny lapse in judgment.
And I never hear the end of it.

180
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,592
Truth is, I should file
a complaint against them.

181
00:08:31,185 --> 00:08:32,511
For what exactly?

182
00:08:32,869 --> 00:08:34,770
Contaminating my experiment.

183
00:08:35,188 --> 00:08:37,856
My fem-bot prototype
was working perfectly...

184
00:08:37,981 --> 00:08:39,560
Do I really want to know this?

185
00:08:40,914 --> 00:08:43,856
She was working perfectly
before I went to get my coffee,

186
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:45,941
when I came back
after the collider accident,

187
00:08:46,302 --> 00:08:49,949
she was completely non-responsive.

188
00:08:53,877 --> 00:08:55,826
Maybe she's just not that into you.

189
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:59,413
How could the collider affect

190
00:09:00,588 --> 00:09:02,124
your mechanical girlfriend?

191
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,961
You think they call it dark
energy because it's friendly?

192
00:09:08,293 --> 00:09:10,334
They have no idea what it can do.

193
00:09:19,327 --> 00:09:22,329
The embedded controller's fried.
No wonder the balance was off.

194
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,067
I'm just glad you're okay.

195
00:09:26,063 --> 00:09:27,691
Actually, Julia, I'm not.

196
00:09:28,517 --> 00:09:30,246
My brush with death
and this Nemesis thing

197
00:09:30,371 --> 00:09:33,238
has made me realize
that life is short and fate is cruel.

198
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:35,443
Especially around here.

199
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,243
There are so many things
I want to do before I die,

200
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,830
and I know we haven't been
together for very long,

201
00:09:42,246 --> 00:09:45,542
but I'd like to do them with you.

202
00:09:46,851 --> 00:09:48,337
What did you have in mind?

203
00:09:49,091 --> 00:09:50,182
I made a list.

204
00:09:52,247 --> 00:09:53,675
Feel free to add to it.

205
00:09:56,256 --> 00:09:58,672
Skydiving over lake Archimedes.

206
00:09:59,035 --> 00:10:01,335
Bungee jump off the Da Vinci bridge.

207
00:10:02,145 --> 00:10:05,520
- Go on a high-speed chase?
- I figured Jo could help us out.

208
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,314
I mean, she'd probably enjoy it.

209
00:10:11,065 --> 00:10:12,565
Fargo, what is that?

210
00:10:16,565 --> 00:10:19,243
No, it's an incredible opportunity.

211
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:20,411
I just...

212
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,996
I just need a little more time.

213
00:10:24,475 --> 00:10:25,475
Bye.

214
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,210
Let me guess. Time share in Boca.

215
00:10:30,045 --> 00:10:32,445
Actually, a job opportunity.

216
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:36,919
After Allison gets back from maternity
leave, I am officially unemployed.

217
00:10:38,435 --> 00:10:39,500
What is it?

218
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:43,080
A private funder is building
a new ultra-large radio telescope array,

219
00:10:43,205 --> 00:10:46,228
- and they need someone to run it.
- Congratulations.

220
00:10:46,555 --> 00:10:47,729
And where is it?

221
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:51,875
Australia.

222
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:57,864
That's far.

223
00:10:59,645 --> 00:11:01,868
And you're considering it?

224
00:11:03,475 --> 00:11:05,247
They made me the job offer
a week ago.

225
00:11:06,935 --> 00:11:08,875
So before you and I...

226
00:11:14,035 --> 00:11:15,035
You okay?

227
00:11:17,495 --> 00:11:19,995
You could have mentioned it before.

228
00:11:20,935 --> 00:11:24,635
At the time, it didn't have
anything to do with you.

229
00:11:28,565 --> 00:11:29,565
So...

230
00:11:32,245 --> 00:11:33,245
Right.

231
00:11:37,685 --> 00:11:41,990
The collider accident may have been
more serious than we thought.

232
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:44,703
Larry says that dark energy
might be the cause.

233
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,060
Okay, well, first of all,
the accident was contained.

234
00:11:47,185 --> 00:11:48,790
And second, can we get back to us?

235
00:11:49,435 --> 00:11:52,835
You know, I really have
to deal with this collider thing.

236
00:11:56,665 --> 00:11:59,465
Well, don't worry about it.
I got everything under control.

237
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,098
Not a word.

238
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:06,875
Come on.

239
00:12:09,825 --> 00:12:13,375
- Hey, Julia, what's going on?
- I don't know. Please hurry.

240
00:12:17,825 --> 00:12:19,475
Hey, Martha, what's up?

241
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,206
I am.

242
00:12:31,055 --> 00:12:32,755
Of course you are.

243
00:12:37,996 --> 00:12:42,000
- It's gotta be a gravity anomaly.
- Well, or a Fargo anomaly.

244
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,887
What button did you push this time?

245
00:12:44,285 --> 00:12:46,848
Can you not recognize a victim
when you see one?

246
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:51,395
You know, he's right. There's nothing
in this lab that could cause that.

247
00:12:51,745 --> 00:12:54,022
Maybe he brought it in with him
from the lab that exploded.

248
00:12:54,355 --> 00:12:56,316
The collider has nothing
to do with gravity.

249
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,402
The dark energy?
You don't know what that does.

250
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,470
You can't track it around
on your shoes.

251
00:13:00,595 --> 00:13:03,907
Guys? Can we maybe focus on
getting me down before gravity returns?

252
00:13:04,205 --> 00:13:06,105
It's okay, honey, I got you.

253
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,251
You know what, Fargo, why don't you try
pushing yourself away from the ceiling?

254
00:13:20,535 --> 00:13:21,535
No luck.

255
00:13:25,755 --> 00:13:28,348
- Missed it by that much.
- Oh, my God, Fargo, are you okay?

256
00:13:29,415 --> 00:13:32,060
Remind me to cross base jumping
off the bucket list.

257
00:13:32,185 --> 00:13:34,585
Yeah, let's get you
to the infirmary.

258
00:13:34,825 --> 00:13:38,358
Who knows what
you've been exposed to?

259
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,656
I have an idea,
but I wanna talk to Zane.

260
00:13:45,275 --> 00:13:48,285
It's not the collider. I've told you
everything there is to know.

261
00:13:48,705 --> 00:13:50,605
I just need to talk to Zane.

262
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:58,930
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

263
00:13:59,055 --> 00:14:02,205
<i>for the next event
in the Tesla biotech dive finals,</i>

264
00:14:02,405 --> 00:14:03,855
<i>the 10-meter board.</i>

265
00:14:04,055 --> 00:14:06,595
<i>Our first contestant,
Samantha Welke,</i>

266
00:14:07,035 --> 00:14:09,500
<i>will be attempting
a 2 1/2 forward pike</i>

267
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,725
<i>with a 2.1 degree of difficulty.</i>

268
00:14:12,175 --> 00:14:14,978
<i>Samantha's dive will be controlled
by Kelsey Hess.</i>

269
00:14:33,535 --> 00:14:34,885
Damn, she's good.

270
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:37,335
But I'm better.

271
00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:42,255
I'm not gonna get electrocuted
or anything, am I?

272
00:14:42,655 --> 00:14:44,245
Relax. It's a subcutaneous,

273
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,635
nuclear, neuro-stimulus system,
totally waterproof.

274
00:14:47,245 --> 00:14:49,700
So much more advanced
than skin contact.

275
00:14:49,825 --> 00:14:51,014
Wait, subcutaneous?

276
00:14:52,616 --> 00:14:53,517
What the hell?

277
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,937
The biometric sensors
need to be injected

278
00:14:57,265 --> 00:14:59,272
into all of your primary joints.

279
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:01,316
Damn it.

280
00:15:01,695 --> 00:15:05,487
The sensors will read the signal
from my remote to control your body.

281
00:15:06,265 --> 00:15:08,891
All you have to do is relax

282
00:15:09,915 --> 00:15:11,243
and score a perfect ten.

283
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:13,662
Well, you didn't tell me
about the pain.

284
00:15:15,265 --> 00:15:17,420
I can't believe this could be
our last dive final.

285
00:15:17,545 --> 00:15:20,432
Pilar, it's our first dive final.
So, not so sentimental.

286
00:15:20,945 --> 00:15:24,949
Okay, but everything we do now
could be our last everything.

287
00:15:25,855 --> 00:15:29,052
At least you care about that.
Lucas couldn't be bothered.

288
00:15:31,275 --> 00:15:33,765
Oh, God,
I can't believe I'm doing this.

289
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,975
Ready to warm up?

290
00:15:39,455 --> 00:15:41,705
Oh, God, this is really disturbing.

291
00:15:42,897 --> 00:15:44,728
Jack, don't walk away
from me like that.

292
00:15:45,715 --> 00:15:48,870
I'm just trying to do my job,
so I can get to Zoe's dive thing.

293
00:15:48,995 --> 00:15:50,448
You know, and my watch is broken.

294
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,880
Yeah, I know. I heard about Harvard.

295
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:55,954
- Are you okay?
- Well, it's every dad's dream, right?

296
00:15:57,765 --> 00:15:58,665
Can we talk?

297
00:16:00,475 --> 00:16:01,830
What do you wanna say?

298
00:16:01,955 --> 00:16:05,046
- I mean, you knew you were going away.
- I haven't decided if I'm gonna leave.

299
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,575
- You didn't mention the job offer.
- I haven't accepted it yet.

300
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,726
I'm having a rough day,
so what do you want?

301
00:16:09,851 --> 00:16:11,386
What do you need?
What do you want?

302
00:16:15,084 --> 00:16:16,391
Whatever makes you happy.

303
00:16:21,803 --> 00:16:23,917
Tell me you figured out
this dark energy problem.

304
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:26,392
Well, theoretically, the power surge
could have produced

305
00:16:26,517 --> 00:16:29,642
a negatively-charged strangelet,
or possibly a monopole,

306
00:16:29,767 --> 00:16:32,282
or maybe even
an itty, bitty black hole.

307
00:16:33,315 --> 00:16:34,965
Itty, bitty black hole?

308
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,986
Yeah, but none of those things
happened.

309
00:16:37,111 --> 00:16:39,061
Including a dark energy leak.

310
00:16:40,535 --> 00:16:43,435
Well, you seem pretty certain.
How do you know?

311
00:16:43,885 --> 00:16:45,835
Because the stabilizer froze.

312
00:16:45,985 --> 00:16:48,385
It broke down
before it even started.

313
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,592
It crashed before it smashed.

314
00:16:50,895 --> 00:16:52,927
You satisfied I told you
everything I know?

315
00:16:55,465 --> 00:16:57,932
- How's Fargo?
- Melodramatic and anemic.

316
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,869
- I'm glad to hear it.
- No, actually, he's quite anemic.

317
00:17:01,994 --> 00:17:04,230
He's been taking iron supplements
all of his life.

318
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,066
Wait,

319
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,108
iron.

320
00:17:07,342 --> 00:17:10,362
I mean, that fits, right? Everything
that was metal got stuck to the ceiling.

321
00:17:10,595 --> 00:17:12,614
Wait, so Fargo was a human magnet?

322
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,407
Something produced a wellspring
of electromagnetic energy,

323
00:17:15,532 --> 00:17:17,911
and I suppose
Fargo got caught up in it.

324
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,174
What time did the collider
break down?

325
00:17:20,695 --> 00:17:22,082
That would be 10:06.

326
00:17:23,095 --> 00:17:25,260
That's the same time
that my watch stopped.

327
00:17:25,385 --> 00:17:28,630
What if whatever messed it up
also messed up the stabilizer?

328
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,930
An intense electromagnetic energy field
could have frozen your watch gears.

329
00:17:32,055 --> 00:17:34,386
And the stabilizer gears
on the magnetic damping rings.

330
00:17:34,905 --> 00:17:38,005
Call me if you find out anything.
I'm late for Zoe.

331
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,508
Tough break.

332
00:18:01,995 --> 00:18:03,845
I'm having second thoughts.

333
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:09,085
You already got into Harvard.
The rest of us have to prove ourselves.

334
00:18:09,246 --> 00:18:10,046
So mush.

335
00:18:10,855 --> 00:18:12,455
Okay, okay, I'm going.

336
00:18:13,735 --> 00:18:15,871
Oh, God,
please don't make me belly flop.

337
00:18:33,945 --> 00:18:36,995
<i>Next up, the team of Zoe Carter
and Pilar Reed.</i>

338
00:18:37,745 --> 00:18:40,990
<i>Zoe will be attempting
a back 3 1/2 somersault</i>

339
00:18:41,115 --> 00:18:43,204
<i>with a 2.9 degree of difficulty.</i>

340
00:18:43,675 --> 00:18:45,331
Wait, she can't do that, can she?

341
00:18:45,845 --> 00:18:48,550
She doesn't have to.
I'm controlling her every move.

342
00:18:48,675 --> 00:18:50,420
Nuclear neuro-stimulus technology.

343
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:51,796
Nuclear?

344
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,101
Hold on, hold on, stop, stop.

345
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,807
You're okay.

346
00:19:59,247 --> 00:20:00,782
I think I know what caused it.

347
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,490
This is a satellite image
from the time of the anomaly.

348
00:20:03,615 --> 00:20:05,662
Now you see that red patch
over the Tesla pool?

349
00:20:05,933 --> 00:20:08,498
That is a hot spot
of electromagnetism.

350
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,937
Intense, electromagnetic fields
can cause

351
00:20:11,062 --> 00:20:13,670
hydrogen and oxygen atoms to split.

352
00:20:13,853 --> 00:20:16,228
And would that make the pool
look like it was boiling?

353
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,507
You have two highly combustible
gases ignited by the transmitters

354
00:20:19,632 --> 00:20:21,511
under Zoe's skin and, bam.

355
00:20:22,517 --> 00:20:24,353
And this is
the same electromagnetic field

356
00:20:24,478 --> 00:20:26,101
that pinned Fargo to the ceiling?

357
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:29,519
Probably. There's a whole band
of it fluctuating over Eureka.

358
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,366
I saw a computer simulation...
Fargo's computer simulation

359
00:20:32,491 --> 00:20:34,607
of what happens
when Nemesis passes the Earth.

360
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,234
But that's 2,000 years from now.

361
00:20:36,754 --> 00:20:40,384
What if somehow
Nemesis is already here?

362
00:20:46,215 --> 00:20:48,492
I am sorry I missed your meet.

363
00:20:48,617 --> 00:20:52,250
I heard
your performance was explosive.

364
00:20:53,276 --> 00:20:54,076
Funny.

365
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,046
I think my dad was really panicked
for a second there.

366
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,334
I don't think
that's gonna change anytime soon.

367
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:02,016
You know, it's hard to protect
your kid from across the country.

368
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:03,211
Yeah, I guess.

369
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,969
And, like me,

370
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:06,794
he's gonna miss you...

371
00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:09,225
A lot more than he lets on.

372
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:12,645
He tried to be cool about it,
but I could completely tell.

373
00:21:13,924 --> 00:21:15,106
You should talk to him.

374
00:21:16,752 --> 00:21:17,840
Yeah, you're right.

375
00:21:17,965 --> 00:21:21,793
I was just so excited to tell Lucas,
but he couldn't be bothered to care.

376
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,322
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

377
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:35,853
I heard what happened.

378
00:21:36,177 --> 00:21:39,386
I feel like a jerk that I wasn't there.
But I had good reason.

379
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:42,578
Can we talk?

380
00:21:43,484 --> 00:21:44,314
Please?

381
00:21:53,805 --> 00:21:55,977
Are you sure you don't need
to throw up again?

382
00:21:58,245 --> 00:22:00,812
I think I got it all
out of my system on the way down.

383
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:07,010
At least you get to cross
skydiving off the list.

384
00:22:08,476 --> 00:22:10,620
You know, I'm thinking maybe
we can scratch off

385
00:22:10,745 --> 00:22:12,913
anything to do
with plummeting to my doom.

386
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:15,226
You know, Fargo, there are things

387
00:22:15,351 --> 00:22:18,586
that we can put on the list
that don't involve mortal danger.

388
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,213
Such as?

389
00:22:34,815 --> 00:22:36,604
I thought this didn't involve
mortal danger.

390
00:22:39,195 --> 00:22:40,321
Everybody down.

391
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,739
There's no way a neutron star could
be anywhere near our solar system.

392
00:22:48,864 --> 00:22:50,913
Not the real Nemesis.
A man-made copy.

393
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:52,742
The similarities are remarkable.

394
00:22:52,867 --> 00:22:54,476
This growing electromagnetic field

395
00:22:54,601 --> 00:22:57,250
has all the properties of a massive
magnetic polar disturbance.

396
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,918
How massive are we talking here?

397
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,421
I'm in the middle of something here.

398
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:05,508
So am I. All the metal at Café Diem
just took off flying.

399
00:23:05,813 --> 00:23:08,036
- It hit Café Diem.
- Tell her it's dissipating.

400
00:23:08,161 --> 00:23:09,554
It's dissipating.
Hang on, Jo.

401
00:23:09,811 --> 00:23:11,654
I'm not the one hanging.

402
00:23:17,804 --> 00:23:19,439
Cross knife-throwing
off the list too.

403
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:25,363
Never mind.
We're good.

404
00:23:26,314 --> 00:23:27,368
Keep me posted.

405
00:23:27,493 --> 00:23:29,741
- Café Diem. Where's it heading next?
- No way to tell.

406
00:23:30,073 --> 00:23:33,202
The magnetic field shows fluctuating
energy that comes and goes.

407
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,663
It's the same effect we see over time
when the Earth's magnetic poles reverse.

408
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,115
But magnitude stronger and faster.

409
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,114
Right now it's localized in Eureka.

410
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:43,476
But if the energy keeps building,
it won't be for long.

411
00:23:43,601 --> 00:23:46,114
If it's only happening here,
then someone here must have caused it.

412
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:47,546
So what I need to know

413
00:23:47,671 --> 00:23:50,928
is who could have created
a mini death star.

414
00:23:51,553 --> 00:23:53,473
Well, they would have to have

415
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:55,300
detailed knowledge of Nemesis

416
00:23:55,425 --> 00:23:58,394
in order to replicate the effect.

417
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:02,815
Please.
Give me a little credit.

418
00:24:05,315 --> 00:24:07,820
Credit.
Maybe that's what they wanted.

419
00:24:08,293 --> 00:24:10,655
Credit for what? For starting
an extinction-level event?

420
00:24:10,925 --> 00:24:13,538
Or stopping one. Saving the world
looks pretty good on a resume.

421
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,288
But it's 2,000 years away.

422
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,498
They would have
to have access to Henry's data.

423
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:21,709
What kind of novice would
attempt something so dangerous?

424
00:24:24,228 --> 00:24:27,090
A novice who doesn't want
his girlfriend to leave him behind.

425
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:35,857
I can't believe
I almost lost you today.

426
00:24:36,801 --> 00:24:37,871
But you didn't.

427
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:39,352
And you won't.

428
00:24:40,366 --> 00:24:41,242
I don't know.

429
00:24:41,367 --> 00:24:43,258
Harvard's a long way from here.

430
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,779
I want to be with you always.

431
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,339
Me too.

432
00:24:51,684 --> 00:24:54,547
That's why I've been working so hard
to keep us together.

433
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:58,738
I mean, I want to be with you.

434
00:25:12,768 --> 00:25:14,554
No distance can take that away.

435
00:25:25,172 --> 00:25:26,274
- Dad.
- Sheriff.

436
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:28,985
And now my perfect day is complete.

437
00:25:30,577 --> 00:25:32,774
Please don't blame him.
It was my idea.

438
00:25:33,712 --> 00:25:35,792
Tell me you're talking
about electromagnetic energy.

439
00:25:35,917 --> 00:25:37,285
Oh, I think she is.

440
00:25:38,684 --> 00:25:42,623
Is this a micro-electromagnetic
pulse simulator?

441
00:25:43,071 --> 00:25:44,957
Pulse amplifier.

442
00:25:45,874 --> 00:25:48,629
At least it's supposed to be.
I haven't gotten it to work yet.

443
00:25:49,672 --> 00:25:51,423
- Well, don't be so sure.
- What?

444
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:53,160
Come see for yourself.

445
00:25:54,926 --> 00:25:57,781
Henry, the machine isn't even on.
It's on stand-by.

446
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,023
It worked.

447
00:26:08,673 --> 00:26:10,435
I mean, it worked.

448
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:15,436
What is that?

449
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,455
That is a new magnetic pole.

450
00:26:23,045 --> 00:26:24,497
You mean, like the North Pole?

451
00:26:25,765 --> 00:26:26,959
It's about to be.

452
00:26:27,318 --> 00:26:30,379
This is very, very bad.

453
00:26:35,897 --> 00:26:39,366
How in bejesus' name
did you create a new North Pole?

454
00:26:39,491 --> 00:26:41,265
Ignore the crazy man, Lucas,

455
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:42,892
and just talk us through it.

456
00:26:45,147 --> 00:26:48,009
I used the data from Kim to build
the simulation of the forces

457
00:26:48,134 --> 00:26:50,357
that Nemesis would create
when it passed Earth.

458
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:52,571
To measure the relative change
in gravitational pull.

459
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:55,238
Right. Then I designed
the electromagnetic amplifier

460
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:58,573
to lock our planet's poles in place
so they wouldn't reverse.

461
00:26:58,996 --> 00:27:00,201
But my test failed.

462
00:27:00,406 --> 00:27:01,625
Well, not so much.

463
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,884
There have been magnetic problems
all over town,

464
00:27:04,009 --> 00:27:06,343
including what happened
to Zoe at the pool.

465
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,950
But my amplifier isn't even on now.

466
00:27:10,146 --> 00:27:11,960
And it's only a scale model.

467
00:27:12,085 --> 00:27:14,506
It doesn't have enough juice
to cause something like that.

468
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,503
Unless there was a boost
from somewhere else.

469
00:27:16,628 --> 00:27:18,060
The explosion from the collider.

470
00:27:18,185 --> 00:27:21,347
I think your amplifier threw off
the magnetic stabilizers.

471
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:23,057
And that surge in electromagnetism

472
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:25,058
fed back into the strength
of the amplifier,

473
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:27,143
creating a loop
of building energy, and, voila,

474
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,479
a new North Pole.

475
00:27:29,194 --> 00:27:31,774
I swear, I had no idea.

476
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:36,237
You are gonna have to tell Santa

477
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,724
that he needs to move his workshop.

478
00:27:41,582 --> 00:27:43,160
Lucas, what were you thinking?

479
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:45,454
That you were leaving.

480
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:49,292
And I couldn't handle it.

481
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,336
I thought maybe if I came up
with a solution to Nemesis,

482
00:27:52,627 --> 00:27:54,677
then Henry would write me
a recommendation letter

483
00:27:54,802 --> 00:27:56,841
like he did for you,
and then we could go together.

484
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:02,369
I'm sorry. You know what,
I meant to talk to you about it,

485
00:28:02,494 --> 00:28:04,180
and I just forgot.
I'm sorry.

486
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:07,643
All right.

487
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:09,270
How do we shut it down?

488
00:28:09,545 --> 00:28:10,443
I don't know.

489
00:28:10,568 --> 00:28:13,079
I mean, we're witnessing
a electromagnetic runaway.

490
00:28:13,204 --> 00:28:15,449
Lucas lit the match
flamed by the collider

491
00:28:15,574 --> 00:28:18,487
and now fueled
by the Earth's own magnetic field.

492
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,865
If we can't break the cycle,
the planet will experience

493
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,367
the same thing Lucas
was trying to prevent.

494
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:25,359
A spontaneous polar reversal.

495
00:28:26,502 --> 00:28:29,582
Guess this would be a bad time
to ask for that recommendation.

496
00:28:58,490 --> 00:28:59,827
That's a new one.

497
00:29:10,683 --> 00:29:11,711
What's up, Jo?

498
00:29:12,895 --> 00:29:14,640
Small issue.

499
00:29:20,185 --> 00:29:22,468
The new magnetic pole
is gaining strength.

500
00:29:23,093 --> 00:29:24,399
That looks bad.

501
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,539
That is the buildup
to a spontaneous polar reversal.

502
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:31,685
Fluctuations in the magnetic field are
causing random surges all over town.

503
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:34,634
Point taken.

504
00:29:34,869 --> 00:29:36,711
Well, but the surges
aren't that random.

505
00:29:36,836 --> 00:29:38,350
Look at the energy output.

506
00:29:38,475 --> 00:29:39,902
They all have a negative charge.

507
00:29:40,456 --> 00:29:42,249
If we could create
a controlled burst

508
00:29:42,374 --> 00:29:45,782
of positive electromagnetic energy,
we might be able to cancel that out.

509
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,118
How do we do that?

510
00:29:47,325 --> 00:29:50,020
Well, we'll load a tactical missile
with a positron payload

511
00:29:50,145 --> 00:29:52,462
and launch it directly
into the center of the pole.

512
00:29:52,587 --> 00:29:53,749
It's a piece of cake.

513
00:29:57,833 --> 00:29:59,379
Just had to say it, didn't you?

514
00:30:00,024 --> 00:30:01,632
The town's grid is down.

515
00:30:01,899 --> 00:30:03,899
That presents a small problem.

516
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:08,208
And by small
you mean insurmountably large, yeah?

517
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:10,975
Anything outside of GD
that runs on electricity or batteries

518
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,309
is affected by the pole.

519
00:30:12,664 --> 00:30:14,914
Cars, computers, tactical missiles.

520
00:30:15,106 --> 00:30:17,906
All our normal delivery
vehicles are useless.

521
00:30:19,004 --> 00:30:21,193
How about
an abnormal delivery vehicle?

522
00:30:27,904 --> 00:30:28,954
What the...

523
00:30:42,427 --> 00:30:44,592
And now I know the world's ending.

524
00:30:48,311 --> 00:30:49,931
You ever hear of knocking?

525
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,056
No!

526
00:30:52,609 --> 00:30:53,517
Obviously.

527
00:30:54,017 --> 00:30:55,186
What are you doing?

528
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,682
Living life to the fullest, Sheriff.

529
00:30:57,807 --> 00:30:59,607
- Now did you need me or...
- You, no.

530
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:00,582
Martha.

531
00:31:00,707 --> 00:31:03,981
When everything was on the ceiling,
she was unaffected, so...

532
00:31:04,106 --> 00:31:05,362
It's because she's made

533
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,073
of nonmetallic composites
and rad-hardened electronics.

534
00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:10,857
Close enough for me.
Martha, Fargo, come.

535
00:31:10,982 --> 00:31:12,009
With me.

536
00:31:15,184 --> 00:31:16,861
Okay, just one second.

537
00:31:22,212 --> 00:31:23,172
How much longer?

538
00:31:25,186 --> 00:31:27,176
We're loading
the positron beam emitter now.

539
00:31:27,605 --> 00:31:29,307
<i>Give us five minutes.</i>

540
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:31,787
Let's hope she doesn't miss.

541
00:31:31,948 --> 00:31:32,895
Dad, wait.

542
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,325
I told you to stay in the rotunda
until we fix this mess.

543
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:37,770
If you send in martha,
she'll fry my amplifier.

544
00:31:37,946 --> 00:31:41,232
Your amplifier caused this problem,
so I'm thinking that's a bonus.

545
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:43,317
You don't understand.
The amplifier's off.

546
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,749
But when martha hits the pole
with positrons,

547
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:47,905
the EM pulse over my garage
could turn it on.

548
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:51,158
So if it surges now,
it'll only make the pole stronger.

549
00:31:51,382 --> 00:31:52,910
Like throwing napalm on a campfire.

550
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,453
We're screwed?

551
00:31:55,011 --> 00:31:56,997
Not if we reverse the polarity
of my amplifier.

552
00:31:57,758 --> 00:32:00,058
It would then emit a positive charge

553
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:03,087
and increase
the punch of martha's positron beam.

554
00:32:03,332 --> 00:32:04,171
Exactly.

555
00:32:04,934 --> 00:32:06,507
Okay, tell me what I have to do.

556
00:32:07,081 --> 00:32:10,363
The pole is centered above the garage,
so you'll never reach it.

557
00:32:10,488 --> 00:32:12,137
It's the eye of the magnetic storm.

558
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:14,128
And the effect
is 100 times stronger now.

559
00:32:14,253 --> 00:32:16,324
Then I'll take off my jewelry first.

560
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,144
A field this strong
can affect brain function,

561
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,188
causing a synaptic misfire.

562
00:32:21,526 --> 00:32:23,676
A complete loss of motor control.

563
00:32:27,171 --> 00:32:28,955
Then maybe you can give me a hand.

564
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:34,868
I'm done.

565
00:32:35,968 --> 00:32:38,122
Okay, you're all set.

566
00:32:42,213 --> 00:32:43,213
Dad.

567
00:32:47,568 --> 00:32:48,924
I don't want you to go.

568
00:32:50,917 --> 00:32:52,052
The feeling's mutual.

569
00:32:52,421 --> 00:32:54,398
Me going off to college
and you risking your life

570
00:32:54,523 --> 00:32:55,889
are hardly the same thing.

571
00:32:58,973 --> 00:33:00,144
It's my job.

572
00:33:01,362 --> 00:33:02,771
And if I don't risk my life,

573
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,963
then you won't have a college
to go to.

574
00:33:05,088 --> 00:33:08,238
None of this would be
happening if I wasn't leaving.

575
00:33:08,606 --> 00:33:10,529
God, if something happens to you...

576
00:33:12,719 --> 00:33:14,241
Zo, I'm gonna be fine.

577
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:40,351
<i>The first thing you've got
to do is find Lucas's amplifier.</i>

578
00:33:41,609 --> 00:33:42,936
This should be fun.

579
00:33:43,514 --> 00:33:44,897
That's it, right there.

580
00:33:45,309 --> 00:33:46,607
I feel like Frogger.

581
00:33:46,886 --> 00:33:48,859
Stop stalling already and move.

582
00:33:49,151 --> 00:33:50,694
Don't boss me, blondie.

583
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,159
What is that for?

584
00:33:57,383 --> 00:33:59,912
For saying blondie
like it's a bad thing.

585
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,774
<i>All right, I'm here if you need me.</i>

586
00:34:04,622 --> 00:34:07,169
<i>Jack, the pole is gaining strength.
You have to move fast.</i>

587
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:09,129
You think?

588
00:34:12,307 --> 00:34:13,860
For your sake, Lucas,

589
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,360
this better work.

590
00:34:18,908 --> 00:34:20,391
Jack, are you okay?

591
00:34:21,116 --> 00:34:22,149
Perfect.

592
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:26,764
Can't move my legs.

593
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:28,875
Or arms.

594
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:32,194
The field affects his nervous system.
He's losing muscle control.

595
00:34:32,462 --> 00:34:34,446
Hang on.
I'm gonna help you up.

596
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:50,671
I don't like this at all!

597
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:05,185
Jump!

598
00:35:05,699 --> 00:35:06,687
<i>Jump!</i>

599
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:07,855
Hang on.

600
00:35:10,503 --> 00:35:14,027
Sorry, sorry, I'm just getting
some electromagnetic interference.

601
00:35:18,309 --> 00:35:19,692
We lost the signal again.

602
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:21,917
How will we know when to launch?

603
00:35:38,571 --> 00:35:40,421
I'd say that's a good sign.

604
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,106
- Oh, non.
- What?

605
00:35:51,389 --> 00:35:52,941
They've launched the drone.

606
00:35:53,181 --> 00:35:56,612
<i>You've got to reverse the polarity.
And get out. Martha's on her way.</i>

607
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,868
It's right in front of you.

608
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,125
Got it!

609
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:12,509
There's a dial
on the left side of the housing.

610
00:36:12,634 --> 00:36:15,297
Turn it clockwise until it stops
to reverse the polarity.

611
00:36:19,938 --> 00:36:21,136
Come on, Tess.

612
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,932
<i>A little closer.</i>

613
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,747
<i>I can feel my legs.</i>

614
00:36:29,872 --> 00:36:32,254
It's working.
The amplifier's weakening the field.

615
00:36:32,379 --> 00:36:33,649
Martha's almost there.

616
00:36:33,982 --> 00:36:35,256
<i>Run.</i>

617
00:36:58,871 --> 00:37:00,448
Are you there?

618
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:04,137
Dad, please say something.

619
00:37:08,153 --> 00:37:09,351
I need a vacation.

620
00:37:12,749 --> 00:37:14,106
You did it, Jack.

621
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,510
I had a little help.

622
00:37:21,713 --> 00:37:23,113
I need a vacation.

623
00:37:27,613 --> 00:37:30,272
Bet you never thought you'd be happy
to see them doing that, huh?

624
00:37:30,397 --> 00:37:33,256
I'm not sure if happy
is quite the right word.

625
00:37:33,983 --> 00:37:36,513
We dodged a major bullet today.

626
00:37:36,638 --> 00:37:38,004
Yes, and he helped.

627
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:41,091
We also wouldn't have needed help
if it wasn't for him.

628
00:37:41,445 --> 00:37:42,594
That's true.

629
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:45,148
But what he created will be
essential to saving the planet

630
00:37:45,273 --> 00:37:46,763
when the real nemesis comes.

631
00:37:48,968 --> 00:37:51,668
You can come up for air anytime.

632
00:37:54,656 --> 00:37:56,249
That was quite a day.

633
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:57,674
It's never dull.

634
00:37:58,585 --> 00:38:00,635
That's what makes this so hard.

635
00:38:04,969 --> 00:38:07,519
And I'm sorry
for making it even harder.

636
00:38:10,481 --> 00:38:14,207
The reason I didn't tell you
about the job offer

637
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,101
was because I didn't know
what this was between us.

638
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:19,630
It's the perfect job for you.

639
00:38:20,602 --> 00:38:21,702
I know that.

640
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:25,510
And I've always wanted
to visit Australia, so...

641
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:29,848
Then come with me.

642
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,602
- I can't come with you.
- Why not?

643
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:35,786
Zoe's leaving.
Jo can handle things here.

644
00:38:36,979 --> 00:38:38,580
We could have something.

645
00:38:40,376 --> 00:38:41,818
Would you think about it?

646
00:38:45,545 --> 00:38:46,531
In the meantime,

647
00:38:48,238 --> 00:38:49,488
if you hate it,

648
00:38:50,338 --> 00:38:51,738
you can come back.

649
00:38:54,014 --> 00:38:56,114
I can come back even if I don't.

650
00:38:58,237 --> 00:38:59,437
Yeah, you can.

651
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:09,554
Sure this is all gonna fit?

652
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:13,407
I'm making Lucas pack
all the spillover in his car.

653
00:39:14,383 --> 00:39:16,583
So, MIT did end up taking him.

654
00:39:16,775 --> 00:39:18,563
Yeah, with Henry's recommendation.

655
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,358
You know, it turns out
the guy has a lot of pull.

656
00:39:21,762 --> 00:39:24,945
I just think he knows talent
when he sees it.

657
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,229
<i>I still can't believe
our little girl is leaving home.</i>

658
00:39:28,961 --> 00:39:30,074
Sarah, don't worry.

659
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:32,474
The holidays will be here
before you know it.

660
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:34,121
You don't want me to come with you?

661
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:36,873
It's sort of a dad's rite of passage.
I could help.

662
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,935
I know, but...

663
00:39:40,331 --> 00:39:42,671
I think this is something
I have to do on my own.

664
00:39:43,094 --> 00:39:46,494
And God knows what havoc they'd wreak
while you were gone.

665
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,590
You know,
I'm actually really gonna miss it.

666
00:39:51,588 --> 00:39:54,057
Part of me just kina wants
to call the whole thing off.

667
00:40:01,469 --> 00:40:03,069
You're gonna do great.

668
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:07,029
You really think so?

669
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:08,972
I know so.

670
00:40:13,772 --> 00:40:14,772
Thank you.

671
00:40:16,975 --> 00:40:17,997
For what?

672
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,583
For...

673
00:40:21,998 --> 00:40:23,345
never giving up on me.

674
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:27,768
That was an option?

675
00:40:29,084 --> 00:40:30,010
Hilarious!

676
00:40:36,449 --> 00:40:38,912
I am gonna miss you like crazy.

677
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,208
But I'm so proud.

678
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:48,814
Well, you know, if I hate it,

679
00:40:49,272 --> 00:40:50,572
I can come back.

680
00:40:51,772 --> 00:40:54,072
You can come back even if you don't.

681
00:40:59,735 --> 00:41:00,957
May I walk you out?

682
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,401
How you holding up?

683
00:41:32,266 --> 00:41:33,990
I'm okay.

684
00:41:36,029 --> 00:41:36,868
Really?

685
00:41:39,972 --> 00:41:42,185
I think sometimes change is good.

686
00:41:51,523 --> 00:41:53,301
I was about to grab a vinspresso.

687
00:41:53,986 --> 00:41:55,336
You want to come?

688
00:41:57,274 --> 00:41:59,274
Yeah, go ahead. I'll catch up.

689
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,730
And there was a package
that came for you.

690
00:42:06,629 --> 00:42:08,229
I put it on your desk.

691
00:42:36,368 --> 00:42:38,597
YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE AUSTRALIA...
LOVE, TESS.

692
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:04,616
I was just about to call you.
