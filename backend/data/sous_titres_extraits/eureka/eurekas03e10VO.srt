1
00:00:01,108 --> 00:00:04,622
No standardized test can tell me
whether I'm fit to do my job.

2
00:00:04,747 --> 00:00:07,875
Biannual recertification
exams are required by the DOD.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,573
To keep your job, Carter.

4
00:00:09,698 --> 00:00:11,704
Make sure you're not slowing down
in your old age.

5
00:00:11,829 --> 00:00:15,051
I'm in the best shape of my life.
I'm like a viking.

6
00:00:15,176 --> 00:00:17,725
These aren't
your standard fitness tests.

7
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,053
How hard can they be?

8
00:00:19,178 --> 00:00:21,290
Well, the exams are unique
to each individual.

9
00:00:21,415 --> 00:00:24,060
For the next 48 hours
they will try to push you to your limit.

10
00:00:24,185 --> 00:00:26,442
Physically, psychologically,
and emotionally.

11
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,363
But don't worry, we haven't had a death
or psychotic break in, like, forever.

12
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:31,846
That's reassuring.

13
00:00:31,971 --> 00:00:35,076
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
I'll check on what's left of you later.

14
00:00:36,152 --> 00:00:37,036
Seriously?

15
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,540
Holy cow, Jo, are you okay?

16
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:43,876
Are you kidding?
That was awesome.

17
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,294
Is this the next victim?

18
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,881
Sheriff, this is Dr. Bella pagani.
She'll be running your exam.

19
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,467
- Hi. It's a pleasure.
- Trust me, it won't be for long.

20
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:55,012
- Hi, Fargo.
- Hey, Julia.

21
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,430
So, how'd my Deputy do?

22
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,563
She's perfect.

23
00:00:59,688 --> 00:01:02,311
- No surprise there.
- Stop it, I'm blushing.

24
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,356
No one expects you to match Deputy
Lupo's performance, Sheriff.

25
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:06,824
That's a relief.

26
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:08,938
Take these and try to get some rest.

27
00:01:09,063 --> 00:01:10,569
The tests can have side effects.

28
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:12,905
This is your panic button.

29
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,326
Couldn't make it any bigger?

30
00:01:18,158 --> 00:01:19,578
Use it anytime to stop the test.

31
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:22,707
Of course, that would mean
admitting defeat...

32
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:25,209
And unemployment.

33
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,837
- Let's get you changed.
- Sure, sure, sure.

34
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:30,256
About watching Zoe.
Just make sure she does her homework.

35
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:32,874
Spend some quality time with SARAH.
She tends to get lonely.

36
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:35,511
And try not to let the town
burn down when I'm gone.

37
00:01:35,756 --> 00:01:39,014
Carter, I'm perfect. Remember?
I can handle my job and yours.

38
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,744
Have fun.

39
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,990
All right.

40
00:01:54,676 --> 00:01:56,226
You wanted to see me?

41
00:01:56,387 --> 00:01:58,826
We are are going to beta-test
a new security system.

42
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,614
I wanted you to be aware of.
Biometric DNA monitoring.

43
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:02,892
That sounds ominous.

44
00:02:03,017 --> 00:02:04,957
It's a way to keep track
of employees.

45
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,975
GD already has security badges,
retinal scans.

46
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:10,859
It's a much more secure system.
It's the next logical step.

47
00:02:10,984 --> 00:02:12,738
To what, <i>1984?</i>

48
00:02:13,172 --> 00:02:14,871
To keeping people safe.

49
00:02:14,996 --> 00:02:18,180
This monitoring system
also has real-world applications.

50
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:22,745
Natural disasters,
industrial accidents, kidnapping.

51
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,370
Invasion of privacy?

52
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:28,250
Dr. Jacob Stefano has been
developing this for three years.

53
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,606
The DOD wants results
or they're gonna cut funding.

54
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:33,235
If you're already decided,
why ask me?

55
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,405
Because it's not limited to Global.
It covers the entire town.

56
00:02:36,995 --> 00:02:38,532
As mayor, you get a vote,

57
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,160
along with me, as head of Global,
and local law enforcement.

58
00:02:41,513 --> 00:02:42,495
Meaning Jack.

59
00:02:43,031 --> 00:02:45,882
Normally, yes.
But since he's tied up in testing,

60
00:02:46,007 --> 00:02:47,124
Jo gets to vote.

61
00:02:48,272 --> 00:02:49,395
Convenient timing.

62
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,591
Not everything is convenient.

63
00:03:08,431 --> 00:03:09,592
Careful.

64
00:03:09,717 --> 00:03:11,617
My girlfriend might see you.

65
00:03:14,334 --> 00:03:16,734
- Awkward.
- I will show you awkward.

66
00:03:20,394 --> 00:03:21,945
You okay, Fargo?

67
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,490
Yeah. Just thinking.

68
00:03:25,586 --> 00:03:27,206
About making out with Jo?

69
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,630
What? No.

70
00:03:28,755 --> 00:03:31,574
Way over that.
Completely.

71
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:35,234
There's someone out there for everyone.
You'll find yours.

72
00:03:35,451 --> 00:03:37,201
You keep telling me that.

73
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:39,577
How'd you do?

74
00:03:39,944 --> 00:03:42,257
Apparently, I'm perfect.

75
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,351
You were serious.

76
00:03:47,896 --> 00:03:50,296
Remember that kiss.
It was your last.

77
00:03:50,619 --> 00:03:51,619
Come on.

78
00:03:52,053 --> 00:03:54,753
I think you're great.
But no one's perfect.

79
00:03:55,222 --> 00:03:56,692
She's darn close.

80
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,874
Why, thank you, Fargo.

81
00:03:59,608 --> 00:04:01,777
Please, he's just trying to get
on your good side.

82
00:04:01,902 --> 00:04:03,951
Maybe you should try to get
on my good side.

83
00:04:05,488 --> 00:04:07,533
Look, I'm just saying
we all have our flaws,

84
00:04:07,658 --> 00:04:10,185
like being hyper-sensitive
and over-reactive.

85
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,155
And all I'm saying is
when you really care about somebody,

86
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,106
you don't focus on their flaws.

87
00:04:15,231 --> 00:04:17,840
So maybe that gives me something
to think about.

88
00:04:21,893 --> 00:04:23,238
Yeah, I'll be right there.

89
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,222
You, I'm done with.

90
00:04:25,905 --> 00:04:28,142
But it was nice to see you, Douglas.

91
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:41,369
So Dr. Stefano,
your pilot program is ready to go?

92
00:04:41,494 --> 00:04:42,313
Absolutely.

93
00:04:42,438 --> 00:04:45,888
Once I've uploaded everyone's
DNA profile into the system,

94
00:04:46,013 --> 00:04:48,140
it'll monitor their vital signs
and location

95
00:04:48,265 --> 00:04:50,831
in case an emergency
security situation arises.

96
00:04:51,204 --> 00:04:54,460
That could definitely come in handy,
especially in this town.

97
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,671
Sure, if you're willing to compromise
civil liberties in the name of security.

98
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,006
A lot of people are.

99
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:02,674
Then let them volunteer their DNA.
Don't make it mandatory.

100
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,928
I vote no.

101
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,682
You're acting Sheriff.
Your vote decides.

102
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:13,187
I have to put town security first.

103
00:05:14,584 --> 00:05:15,522
I vote yes.

104
00:05:16,572 --> 00:05:19,276
Then you can be the first
of our tribunal to go.

105
00:05:19,872 --> 00:05:21,111
Stand in the chamber.

106
00:05:21,885 --> 00:05:23,935
Just stand right in the center.

107
00:05:24,753 --> 00:05:27,034
It'll scan your DNA
in less than a minute.

108
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:31,121
You won't feel a thing.

109
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,411
Shut it down!

110
00:06:00,798 --> 00:06:02,904
Projet-SG (1.00)

111
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,275
I think she's coming around.

112
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:12,412
How do you feel?

113
00:06:12,537 --> 00:06:14,304
Like a freakin' lightbulb.

114
00:06:14,429 --> 00:06:15,461
Let me help you.

115
00:06:15,586 --> 00:06:17,138
Take it easy.

116
00:06:17,263 --> 00:06:18,263
I'm good.

117
00:06:19,742 --> 00:06:21,838
I've done hundreds of scans.

118
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:24,059
I have no idea what went wrong.

119
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,432
Could that
have something to do with it?

120
00:06:37,886 --> 00:06:39,435
The genome spectrometer is missing.

121
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,442
No wonder the settings
went off the charts.

122
00:06:42,187 --> 00:06:43,901
Why would someone take that?

123
00:06:44,081 --> 00:06:47,114
I don't know. But I've a replacement.
So we can get the system back online.

124
00:06:47,922 --> 00:06:50,908
- After what just happened?
- What happened was sabotage.

125
00:06:51,451 --> 00:06:54,121
I put three years into this project.
I'm not giving up now.

126
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,690
Who would do this?

127
00:06:55,991 --> 00:06:57,916
I'm pulling Carter from his exams.

128
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,501
I can handle it.

129
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,336
Jo, you just had quite a jolt.

130
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:03,255
You need time to recover.

131
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:04,902
I'll be fine,

132
00:07:05,027 --> 00:07:07,582
as soon as I regain sensation
in my extremities.

133
00:07:08,355 --> 00:07:10,929
Allison, just get the DNA monitor
back online.

134
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:13,849
- We may be needing it.
- Are you sure you're up to this?

135
00:07:14,121 --> 00:07:17,469
Don't worry about my performance.
Worry about Carter's.

136
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,870
Hello?

137
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,504
I like what you've done
with the place.

138
00:07:32,015 --> 00:07:33,765
I hear white's the new...

139
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,830
black.

140
00:07:42,978 --> 00:07:45,523
So is there gonna be a test
anytime soon?

141
00:07:50,654 --> 00:07:52,012
<i>Push the button.</i>

142
00:07:57,786 --> 00:07:59,087
That's it?

143
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,105
That's the big test?

144
00:08:03,678 --> 00:08:05,192
No wonder Lupo scored so...

145
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:09,906
high.

146
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:13,280
Very high.

147
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:16,195
<i>Push the button.</i>

148
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,129
Crap.

149
00:08:28,405 --> 00:08:29,632
How you feelin'?

150
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,927
A little fuzzy,
but crime waits for no one.

151
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,055
I need to figure out
who'd want to steal

152
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,058
that... genomy... genomic...

153
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:41,455
thermometer... thingy.

154
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:47,067
Just a few hours a Sheriff
and you're already sounding like Carter.

155
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,736
A near-electrocution
can do that to you.

156
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:53,115
I checked for prints, I got nothing.
Any idea what they'd want to use it for?

157
00:08:53,362 --> 00:08:55,477
There's lots of potential
research applications.

158
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,738
But I'm wondering
if it has anything to do

159
00:08:57,863 --> 00:09:01,184
with the missing
intramuscular electrode array.

160
00:09:01,907 --> 00:09:04,877
- Any particular reason?
- Because mine appears to be gone.

161
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:07,671
So that makes two thefts.

162
00:09:08,476 --> 00:09:10,966
Could you try and figure out
a link between the two devices?

163
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,501
- I can try.
- Great.

164
00:09:12,626 --> 00:09:16,264
And I'll work on a list of people
that have access to Stefano's lab.

165
00:09:19,401 --> 00:09:21,143
Right after I help Zoe
with her homework.

166
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,166
A parent's work is never done.

167
00:09:26,978 --> 00:09:30,840
If you differentiate the cross product
of "R" and "P" with respect to time,

168
00:09:30,965 --> 00:09:32,571
that should equal zero, right?

169
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,947
Can't SARAH help you?

170
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,954
<i>I'm sorry,
I'm not programmed to cheat.</i>

171
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:37,701
Whatever. It's good enough.

172
00:09:39,027 --> 00:09:41,079
What do you say we go
to Vincent's for karaoke night?

173
00:09:41,308 --> 00:09:43,540
I'd say I have
a very important case to solve,

174
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:47,252
it's a school night,
and your dad would kill me.

175
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,503
My dad's not here.

176
00:09:49,408 --> 00:09:50,408
But I am.

177
00:09:50,781 --> 00:09:53,431
So for the next 48 hours,
consider me him.

178
00:09:53,817 --> 00:09:57,930
Come on, Jo, aunt Lexi would take me
if she wasn't off at her chakra retreat.

179
00:09:58,403 --> 00:10:01,652
I'm exhausted,
I have a pounding headache,

180
00:10:01,777 --> 00:10:03,699
and all I want to do is take a nap.

181
00:10:03,824 --> 00:10:05,771
And I thought my dad was no fun.

182
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,282
I'm tons of fun.

183
00:10:10,403 --> 00:10:11,403
Whatever.

184
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,322
Just go solve your big case.
I'll be in my room solving this.

185
00:10:18,905 --> 00:10:20,205
<i>Push the button.</i>

186
00:10:21,575 --> 00:10:22,975
You can't do this!

187
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,181
I mean, nobody could do this.
It's impossible.

188
00:10:31,915 --> 00:10:33,315
That's the answer.

189
00:10:33,825 --> 00:10:34,825
Isn't it?

190
00:10:35,475 --> 00:10:38,653
Right?
You can't make a floor disappear.

191
00:10:43,355 --> 00:10:44,655
It's a hologram.

192
00:10:45,595 --> 00:10:46,595
Nice.

193
00:10:48,155 --> 00:10:50,148
Lupo put you up to this, didn't she?

194
00:10:52,205 --> 00:10:53,505
<i>Push the button.</i>

195
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:57,626
Come on, it's my first karaoke night.
I need everything to be perfect.

196
00:11:06,585 --> 00:11:07,870
What are you up to?

197
00:11:07,995 --> 00:11:10,711
You know, protecting and serving.
The usual.

198
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,971
- So what are you working on?
- A new AI program.

199
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:19,849
The first law of robotics
is giving me trouble here.

200
00:11:19,974 --> 00:11:21,817
A robot may not injure
a human being,

201
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:24,770
or through inaction allow
a human being to come into harm.

202
00:11:25,325 --> 00:11:28,050
- You know Asimov's three laws?
- Are you kidding?

203
00:11:28,175 --> 00:11:30,950
- Isaac Asimov is my personal God.
- I had no idea.

204
00:11:31,075 --> 00:11:34,860
Give me some sci-fi and <i>Halo 3</i>
and I am a happy girl.

205
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,782
- So what's going on in here?
- Virtual karaoke night.

206
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,367
You should stick around.

207
00:11:42,855 --> 00:11:43,859
Maybe I will.

208
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,165
Where have you been?
Henry said there's been another theft.

209
00:11:50,305 --> 00:11:51,810
It must have slipped my mind.

210
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:55,070
Jo, we've had two very highly
valuable pieces of equipment stolen.

211
00:11:55,195 --> 00:11:56,974
If you're not feeling up to this...

212
00:11:57,855 --> 00:11:58,855
I'm good.

213
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:00,436
You sure?

214
00:12:00,561 --> 00:12:02,710
Because we need to find out
who's responsible.

215
00:12:02,835 --> 00:12:05,585
Absolutely.
It's already been taken care of.

216
00:12:08,755 --> 00:12:09,755
Who is it?

217
00:12:13,908 --> 00:12:14,608
Him.

218
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,028
What?

219
00:12:18,235 --> 00:12:19,285
Too pitchy?

220
00:12:21,605 --> 00:12:23,750
I swear I'm innocent!

221
00:12:24,205 --> 00:12:26,005
We're trying to talk here.

222
00:12:27,605 --> 00:12:29,605
You gotta show 'em who's boss.

223
00:12:29,905 --> 00:12:31,541
Are you sure that Larry did this?

224
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:34,702
He had motive, knowledge,
and opportunity.

225
00:12:34,827 --> 00:12:36,088
It's a trifecta.

226
00:12:36,285 --> 00:12:38,340
But what, exactly, was his motive?

227
00:12:39,315 --> 00:12:40,665
Isn't it obvious?

228
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:43,637
To steal.

229
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,809
Yeah, but why?

230
00:12:50,918 --> 00:12:53,355
The criminal mind is an enigma.
Is this thing cool or what?

231
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:57,609
I'm a little concerned that the shock to
your system is affecting your judgment.

232
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,777
Shock?

233
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:01,696
At Dr. Stefano's?

234
00:13:02,845 --> 00:13:03,845
Remember?

235
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:07,219
Yeah, I took a nap, and I woke up
feeling like a brand new woman.

236
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:08,703
And now,

237
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,165
- I feel like celebrating my first bust.
- Okay, Jo, you've had dozens of busts.

238
00:13:13,075 --> 00:13:15,125
Well, I mean as acting Sheriff.

239
00:13:16,835 --> 00:13:18,630
Don't worry.
He won't be any more trouble.

240
00:13:19,725 --> 00:13:21,025
Jo's on the job.

241
00:13:24,995 --> 00:13:26,805
He's not the one I'm worried about.

242
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:39,276
So not a hologram.

243
00:13:43,815 --> 00:13:45,215
So not a hologram.

244
00:13:53,335 --> 00:13:57,335
<i>You can use the panic button
at any time to end the test.</i>

245
00:13:59,565 --> 00:14:01,315
Give Jo the satisfaction?

246
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:03,884
I don't think so.

247
00:14:17,145 --> 00:14:18,345
Thanks, but...

248
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,510
Not really much of a card player.

249
00:14:21,635 --> 00:14:24,035
<i>Whatever will help
achieve your goal.</i>

250
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:46,785
Then again...

251
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,205
Before you kill me,
I am really sorry.

252
00:15:15,825 --> 00:15:18,029
For what?
You were amazing.

253
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:19,875
What?

254
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:24,175
So you're not gonna shoot me,
or worse, tell my dad?

255
00:15:25,275 --> 00:15:28,098
Not unless you want me to tell him
that you were awesome.

256
00:15:31,145 --> 00:15:32,597
Hey, Jo.
Your usual?

257
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:34,807
Heck, make it a double.

258
00:15:36,088 --> 00:15:37,438
Whatever you say.

259
00:15:38,345 --> 00:15:39,437
I'm off duty.

260
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,905
Are you gonna sing a song?

261
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,936
Me up there alone?

262
00:15:45,685 --> 00:15:48,989
You can do a duet. We could pick songs
and costumes. It's gonna be awesome.

263
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:50,907
Wait, I...

264
00:15:51,675 --> 00:15:52,675
Oh, boy.

265
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:54,365
Enjoy.

266
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:00,709
Okay, that's not espresso.

267
00:16:01,355 --> 00:16:02,655
No, that's ouzo.

268
00:16:03,605 --> 00:16:04,805
It's my usual.

269
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,449
Jo, come on.
Hurry up.

270
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:11,595
Hit me.

271
00:17:20,525 --> 00:17:22,125
Thank you.
Thank you.

272
00:17:23,065 --> 00:17:24,065
Thank you.

273
00:17:28,842 --> 00:17:31,520
- Did you see me?
- Everybody saw you.

274
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,177
What the hell was that?

275
00:17:34,705 --> 00:17:37,096
The most fun I think I've ever had.

276
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,391
All right, I can't believe this.
Do I know you?

277
00:17:41,505 --> 00:17:42,805
Maybe you don't.

278
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:48,665
Let's get your clothes,
'cause we're leaving.

279
00:17:51,435 --> 00:17:52,535
I'm leaving.

280
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,425
Bye, Fargo.

281
00:18:06,895 --> 00:18:08,294
Hey, rock star.

282
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:11,113
- Rise and shine.
- Does that say 8:00 AM?

283
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:13,365
Yep. Just on my way to school.

284
00:18:14,165 --> 00:18:15,465
How you feeling?

285
00:18:15,665 --> 00:18:17,738
I think my headache's
actually worse.

286
00:18:18,315 --> 00:18:20,515
I'm not surprised,
after last night's performance.

287
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,033
What performance?

288
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,437
You must've been
drunker than I thought.

289
00:18:25,975 --> 00:18:27,075
Cafe Diem...

290
00:18:27,475 --> 00:18:28,475
Karaoke?

291
00:18:29,395 --> 00:18:31,400
You went, even after
I told you not to?

292
00:18:31,795 --> 00:18:33,650
Well, yeah, because
you said it was cool.

293
00:18:33,775 --> 00:18:36,614
- <i>Actually, she forbade it.</i>
- No one's asking you, SARAH.

294
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:39,450
And I've been completely out
since before 8:00?

295
00:18:40,174 --> 00:18:42,350
Yeah, out dancing on pianos
and kissing Fargo.

296
00:18:42,475 --> 00:18:44,575
After which you passed out here.

297
00:18:45,245 --> 00:18:47,095
What are you talking about?

298
00:18:47,715 --> 00:18:49,465
<i>Dr. Fargo is at the door.</i>

299
00:18:50,871 --> 00:18:51,671
That.

300
00:18:52,745 --> 00:18:55,395
Fargo, what are you doing here?

301
00:18:57,615 --> 00:18:59,465
Can I talk to Jo for a sec?

302
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,056
Alone?

303
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:03,760
Actually, I'm starting
to think I want a witness.

304
00:19:03,885 --> 00:19:07,235
- <i>I'm happy to oblige.</i>
- No, thanks, SARAH. We're good.

305
00:19:10,165 --> 00:19:12,192
Let's just come right out
and say it.

306
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,696
Your kiss moved my soul,
and I don't care who knows.

307
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:21,868
Very, very funny.

308
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,578
But I don't have time for this.

309
00:19:24,465 --> 00:19:27,707
No, this is not a joke.
You can ask anyone at the cafe.

310
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:31,544
Okay, I've been through my fair share
of traumas in the last 24 hours,

311
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,723
and kissing Fargo
wasn't one of them.

312
00:19:37,165 --> 00:19:38,896
Sorry, but I gotta get back to work

313
00:19:39,021 --> 00:19:41,638
before Allison decides that
I'm completely incompetent.

314
00:19:43,585 --> 00:19:45,265
You, I'll deal with later.

315
00:19:48,585 --> 00:19:50,385
I'll take 'em if you want.

316
00:19:52,185 --> 00:19:53,185
Thank you.

317
00:20:02,642 --> 00:20:04,079
I'll push the button.

318
00:20:39,746 --> 00:20:40,729
Now what?

319
00:20:47,348 --> 00:20:50,646
<i>Stage 2.
Push the button.</i>

320
00:20:51,102 --> 00:20:52,417
You gotta be kidding me.

321
00:20:53,243 --> 00:20:56,588
<i>You have all the tools
you need to complete the test.</i>

322
00:21:00,729 --> 00:21:02,030
Bunch of psychos!

323
00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:09,869
- What are you doing in there?
- You put me in here!

324
00:21:10,806 --> 00:21:14,814
- Has everyone gone nuts?
- That's what I'd like to know.

325
00:21:15,177 --> 00:21:16,038
Hi.

326
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:18,081
Hi?

327
00:21:19,459 --> 00:21:20,987
That's all you have to say?

328
00:21:23,786 --> 00:21:25,557
What do you expect me to say?

329
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:27,994
"Sorry for getting wasted
and making out with Fargo."

330
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,146
- You made out with Fargo?
- Kinda.

331
00:21:32,856 --> 00:21:35,501
You've been talking to Zoe,
haven't you?

332
00:21:35,744 --> 00:21:37,615
- I saw you last night.
- Brilliant.

333
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:41,049
Let's punk the Deputy
on her first case as Sheriff, yes?

334
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:46,623
You know what?
I can't talk to you right now.

335
00:21:47,623 --> 00:21:48,894
Good luck, Larry.

336
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:52,320
I appreciate the effort.

337
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:53,978
But, Larry...

338
00:21:55,657 --> 00:21:57,957
- Get the hell out of my cell.
- Gladly.

339
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:10,676
It's Allison. We have a problem.
I need you to come to GD right now.

340
00:22:10,801 --> 00:22:11,945
I'm on my way.

341
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:18,122
Hypermethylation plasma was taken
from the infirmary last night.

342
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:19,629
Which is?

343
00:22:20,116 --> 00:22:22,423
A serum used in tumor treatments.

344
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:26,636
So I'll start talking to people,
see if anybody saw anything.

345
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,137
We already know who took it.

346
00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:30,241
Great.

347
00:22:30,872 --> 00:22:32,618
So your DNA monitor's working?

348
00:22:32,743 --> 00:22:34,769
Yeah, I got the system
fully online last night.

349
00:22:35,245 --> 00:22:39,200
Shows this DNA signature in
the infirmary at the time of the theft.

350
00:22:39,774 --> 00:22:41,109
It's a perfect match.

351
00:22:45,383 --> 00:22:47,502
Well, this... This can't be right.

352
00:22:47,828 --> 00:22:49,367
The person behind the thefts...

353
00:22:49,964 --> 00:22:52,174
The person that we've been
looking for...

354
00:22:52,476 --> 00:22:53,204
is you.

355
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:03,798
Nothing is going on with me.
I didn't do anything.

356
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:06,467
Jo, you suffered a serious injury.
You need to be tested.

357
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:08,344
Given the shock to your system,

358
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:11,358
memory loss and aberrant behavior
are not surprising.

359
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:14,490
But I remember everything,
and I'm not aberrant.

360
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,490
So what you did last night
at Café Diem was normal?

361
00:23:17,615 --> 00:23:18,562
I didn't do it.

362
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,209
I took a nap after helping Zoe with
her homework because I had a headache.

363
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:24,444
When I woke up, it was morning.

364
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:27,864
You also arrested Larry last night.
Henry and I were there.

365
00:23:29,103 --> 00:23:31,065
Dr. Pagani did say
that there could be

366
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,889
some side effects
after the recertification exam,

367
00:23:34,521 --> 00:23:37,540
but why would I wanna steal
all that equipment?

368
00:23:38,427 --> 00:23:40,960
Honey, you kissed Fargo.

369
00:23:41,912 --> 00:23:44,867
- You're acting a tad impulsively.
- Jo, we wanna help.

370
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,802
Then figure out what all
that stolen equipment has in common,

371
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,219
and I will figure out
what's going on.

372
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:53,473
You need time to recover. Carter will
be done with his test in 12 hours.

373
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:55,266
- He can take over.
- You know what?

374
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,935
Why don't we just
let her work until he's done.

375
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:02,775
And then you can do
all the testing that you want.

376
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,692
Please, Allison...

377
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:06,194
I am not crazy.

378
00:24:09,229 --> 00:24:11,741
Okay, fine.
12 hours.

379
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,782
Thank you.

380
00:24:23,348 --> 00:24:24,210
Come on.

381
00:24:26,749 --> 00:24:27,548
<i>Come on!</i>

382
00:24:28,517 --> 00:24:29,971
<i>Holy smokes.</i>

383
00:24:35,365 --> 00:24:38,236
Are you here to make sure
your perfect record's intact?

384
00:24:38,361 --> 00:24:40,992
Not so much.
I wanted to talk to Carter.

385
00:24:41,117 --> 00:24:43,150
I'm sorry.
You know the rules.

386
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:45,824
No outside contact
until testing's complete.

387
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:47,985
Did you wanna try back...

388
00:24:51,109 --> 00:24:51,931
Tomorrow?

389
00:24:52,231 --> 00:24:53,742
<i>This sucks!</i>

390
00:24:55,653 --> 00:24:57,161
<i>I gotta go back to the beginning.</i>

391
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,875
Back to the beginning.

392
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:04,870
Thanks.

393
00:25:08,776 --> 00:25:10,677
I know you've been
under a lot of pressure

394
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:13,239
to beta-test
your DNA monitoring system.

395
00:25:13,466 --> 00:25:15,489
Well, there's always a deadline.

396
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,979
That's the nature
of government research.

397
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:21,801
Well, is it possible
that the security was compromised

398
00:25:21,926 --> 00:25:24,925
- when the spectrometer was taken?
- Absolutely not.

399
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:26,398
I replaced the stolen part,

400
00:25:26,523 --> 00:25:28,734
and the system's been working
perfectly ever since.

401
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,753
Then, how come
it showed me in the infirmary

402
00:25:30,878 --> 00:25:32,488
when I was sleeping in a bed?

403
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:35,867
How come I heard you were out
frenching Fargo?

404
00:25:36,857 --> 00:25:37,730
It wasn't me.

405
00:25:38,029 --> 00:25:42,081
The Sheriff's smart house SARAH
confirmed that Jo was there all night.

406
00:25:42,992 --> 00:25:44,116
She must be mistaken.

407
00:25:44,241 --> 00:25:45,801
Then show me the DNA signature

408
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:48,296
of the person in the infirmary
at the time of the theft.

409
00:25:48,585 --> 00:25:50,900
And the person in the smart house.
Now.

410
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:01,475
You've been lying this entire time.
Does this thing even work?!

411
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,729
It was the one anomaly
I couldn't explain.

412
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:06,814
I didn't wanna postpone
the beta-test again.

413
00:26:07,058 --> 00:26:08,023
What anomaly?

414
00:26:08,832 --> 00:26:11,068
There were two DNA signatures
for you.

415
00:26:11,517 --> 00:26:14,802
When the system showed two matching
DNA strands, I thought it was a glitch.

416
00:26:14,927 --> 00:26:17,283
And Jo hasn't exactly
been herself recently.

417
00:26:18,491 --> 00:26:19,406
Have you?

418
00:26:27,644 --> 00:26:30,534
Thanks for last night.
It was memorable.

419
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:34,342
Really? Because this morning
you denied it ever happened.

420
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:36,463
Sorry,
I took a sleeping pill last night,

421
00:26:36,588 --> 00:26:38,512
I was a bit out of sorts,
but I'm better now.

422
00:26:40,055 --> 00:26:41,932
So can we talk?

423
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:44,603
How about tonight
at the Target Range, about 6:00?

424
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:45,895
You mean, like, a date?

425
00:26:46,277 --> 00:26:47,685
I gotta... I gotta run.

426
00:26:57,253 --> 00:26:58,755
You wanna dance?
Let's dance!

427
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,088
Just so you know, in high school
I took a semester of Shotokan.

428
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:07,319
I don't wanna fight.
I'm worried about Jo.

429
00:27:09,631 --> 00:27:12,003
One second she's acting normal.

430
00:27:13,026 --> 00:27:14,548
And the next she's kissing you.

431
00:27:15,002 --> 00:27:17,050
Yeah, maybe she's finally come
to her senses.

432
00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:20,097
You just talked to her.
Didn't she seem different to you?

433
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:24,424
Well, she...
kinda just asked me out.

434
00:27:25,175 --> 00:27:27,157
And that didn't strike you as odd?

435
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,273
It just felt
like we were connecting.

436
00:27:31,494 --> 00:27:34,193
Call me crazy,
but I don't think she was faking.

437
00:27:35,129 --> 00:27:37,006
Yeah, well, that's what worries me.

438
00:27:41,302 --> 00:27:42,478
You are right.

439
00:27:42,603 --> 00:27:44,926
I've been considering
the possible applications

440
00:27:45,051 --> 00:27:47,205
for the three devices
that have been taken.

441
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:51,627
Genome spectrometer, intramuscular
electrode array, methylation plasma.

442
00:27:52,162 --> 00:27:52,962
And?

443
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:55,742
All three have applications
to experiments

444
00:27:55,867 --> 00:27:57,883
dealing with DNA manipulation.

445
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,844
So we're looking for someone
who has access to my DNA.

446
00:28:01,163 --> 00:28:03,639
Yes, but who would want your DNA?

447
00:28:06,512 --> 00:28:08,388
Someone who thinks I'm perfect.

448
00:28:10,982 --> 00:28:12,703
This shouldn't be happening.

449
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,317
This is really bad.

450
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,160
It's about to get worse.

451
00:28:27,577 --> 00:28:28,955
Please don't be mad.

452
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,846
You stole my face!

453
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:33,286
Is this what you used?

454
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:34,837
I'm really sorry, Jo.

455
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:38,382
I just wanted to see what it would
feel like to be you for just a day.

456
00:28:39,283 --> 00:28:41,677
I mean you're... You're beautiful.

457
00:28:42,171 --> 00:28:43,881
And confident and...

458
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,264
everyone respects you.

459
00:28:48,445 --> 00:28:49,908
I wouldn't say I'm beautiful.

460
00:28:50,033 --> 00:28:52,658
Because even the one guy I like
only has eyes for you.

461
00:28:52,783 --> 00:28:55,315
Look, I'm flattered,
but the party's over. Undo it.

462
00:28:55,828 --> 00:28:56,720
I can't.

463
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,410
The DNA base strands
aren't stabilizing.

464
00:28:59,535 --> 00:29:00,988
I can't reverse it.

465
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:04,467
Well, you're not gonna
stop trying until you do.

466
00:29:04,592 --> 00:29:06,118
Even if it's from my jail cell.

467
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:10,122
Please, Jo, I know I messed up,
but I never meant to cause any trouble.

468
00:29:11,534 --> 00:29:13,339
I just wanted to feel less...

469
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,003
ordinary.

470
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,383
Look, I'm sorry,

471
00:29:18,736 --> 00:29:20,413
but you're coming with me.

472
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,055
What's happening?

473
00:29:27,061 --> 00:29:28,432
Remote time-release sedatives.

474
00:29:29,907 --> 00:29:31,666
I gave them to you after the test.

475
00:29:31,791 --> 00:29:34,451
I needed to make sure that there
weren't two of us walking around.

476
00:29:34,576 --> 00:29:35,523
Don't do this.

477
00:29:37,782 --> 00:29:39,442
I'm so sorry, Jo.

478
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:43,694
Just, if I had to choose
between your life or mine...

479
00:29:45,731 --> 00:29:46,826
I'd choose yours.

480
00:29:56,824 --> 00:29:57,711
She's back.

481
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,761
Can you talk?

482
00:30:09,105 --> 00:30:11,225
She's behind the entire thing.
Did you catch her?

483
00:30:12,033 --> 00:30:13,686
Actually, I did.

484
00:30:18,563 --> 00:30:19,775
What did you do to me?

485
00:30:20,177 --> 00:30:22,193
You mean what did you do to me?

486
00:30:22,924 --> 00:30:25,238
Jo told us
how you stole the equipment,

487
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:28,200
and how you used her dna from
the exams to steal her identity.

488
00:30:28,575 --> 00:30:29,575
No!

489
00:30:30,103 --> 00:30:32,865
I figured out
how she stole my identity.

490
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:35,672
And now she's turned me into her.

491
00:30:35,797 --> 00:30:37,997
That's what Jo said you would say.

492
00:30:38,122 --> 00:30:40,804
She tried to convince me
I was going crazy

493
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:43,579
because of post-traumatic
stress syndrome.

494
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,843
You actually had me doubting
my own sanity.

495
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:47,261
You did that to me!

496
00:30:48,876 --> 00:30:51,089
Allison, Henry,
you have to believe me.

497
00:30:51,214 --> 00:30:52,348
I am Jo.

498
00:30:53,358 --> 00:30:55,281
Sheriff Cobb hired me
five years ago.

499
00:30:55,406 --> 00:30:56,937
I graduated top of my class.

500
00:30:57,106 --> 00:30:59,189
I can kill a man with my thumbs!

501
00:30:59,575 --> 00:31:03,160
All of which is information
she could access from my personnel file.

502
00:31:03,285 --> 00:31:04,737
- Julia...
- Don't call me that!

503
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:08,240
When I get out of here,
I'm gonna kick your a...

504
00:31:09,345 --> 00:31:12,599
We're gonna keep you under observation
until we do a full psych work-up.

505
00:31:12,724 --> 00:31:15,331
The ethics committee will
take your mental state

506
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,294
under consideration while they decide
on your redaction from Eureka.

507
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:20,058
No, you can't redact me!

508
00:31:20,183 --> 00:31:21,921
That is exactly what she wants.

509
00:31:24,685 --> 00:31:27,588
I am really sorry.

510
00:31:32,408 --> 00:31:33,808
You can't do this!

511
00:31:35,468 --> 00:31:37,035
I can't do this!

512
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:49,685
That's the answer. Isn't it?

513
00:31:55,407 --> 00:31:56,757
It can't be done.

514
00:32:09,996 --> 00:32:11,646
"All the tools I need."

515
00:32:39,895 --> 00:32:41,208
What else you got, huh?!

516
00:32:43,533 --> 00:32:44,583
Cold water!

517
00:32:50,486 --> 00:32:52,153
Is that crazy or what?!

518
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:54,846
That's crazy.
That's definitely the word.

519
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:56,849
What's wrong? You want a turn?

520
00:32:57,305 --> 00:32:58,405
It's just...

521
00:32:59,751 --> 00:33:02,061
You've kinda been giving me
mixed signals.

522
00:33:04,077 --> 00:33:05,627
I'm sorry about that.

523
00:33:06,426 --> 00:33:08,818
I've been going through
some pretty major changes lately.

524
00:33:10,101 --> 00:33:12,301
You know, what I want out of life.

525
00:33:13,415 --> 00:33:14,867
Who I want to be.

526
00:33:15,824 --> 00:33:17,424
Who I want to be with.

527
00:33:22,643 --> 00:33:24,920
So what do you want?

528
00:33:33,709 --> 00:33:35,559
Let me give you a reminder.

529
00:33:36,034 --> 00:33:37,181
I don't think so.

530
00:33:41,871 --> 00:33:43,562
I thought you liked me.

531
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,023
I do. It's just...

532
00:33:48,168 --> 00:33:51,362
I'm not convinced
I know who you are.

533
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:55,300
But I'd like to.

534
00:33:56,638 --> 00:33:59,276
I'm not sure
you're gonna want to for long.

535
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,840
Zane, thank God you're here!

536
00:34:18,965 --> 00:34:19,932
Julia, right?

537
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:22,351
Allison told me what you did to Jo.

538
00:34:25,627 --> 00:34:27,820
She's Julia Golden.

539
00:34:28,796 --> 00:34:30,101
And I am Jo.

540
00:34:33,396 --> 00:34:34,446
Psych ward.

541
00:34:35,244 --> 00:34:36,244
I'm Henry.

542
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:38,772
I can prove it.

543
00:34:38,897 --> 00:34:41,120
Ask me something personal
that only Jo could know.

544
00:34:46,544 --> 00:34:47,375
Pet peeves.

545
00:34:48,339 --> 00:34:51,588
Small guns, big egos,
and overly-critical boyfriends.

546
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:55,967
- Boxers or briefs?
- Me or you?

547
00:34:56,152 --> 00:34:58,262
- Funny. Me.
- Boxers.

548
00:34:58,894 --> 00:35:00,497
Except on laundry day,

549
00:35:00,622 --> 00:35:03,072
which, by my count,
would be tomorrow.

550
00:35:06,895 --> 00:35:08,105
First date?

551
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,942
Sunday brunch at Café Diem.

552
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:16,731
I was nervous.

553
00:35:18,882 --> 00:35:20,332
You brought a rose.

554
00:35:21,834 --> 00:35:23,284
I wore a sun dress.

555
00:35:26,725 --> 00:35:30,376
You said something smart,
which made me feel dumb.

556
00:35:35,195 --> 00:35:37,845
But you made up for it
on our second date.

557
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,448
So does that mean I sounded dumb,
or I made you feel smart?

558
00:36:01,845 --> 00:36:03,035
A little bit of both.

559
00:36:04,989 --> 00:36:06,245
And how'd the date end?

560
00:36:07,882 --> 00:36:09,744
Let me give you a reminder.

561
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,383
That's my Josefina.

562
00:36:21,133 --> 00:36:24,348
Get me out of here before I taser you
for kissing another woman.

563
00:36:24,517 --> 00:36:26,174
Yep, definitely Jo.

564
00:36:31,347 --> 00:36:33,340
Zane, what's happening to me?

565
00:36:33,465 --> 00:36:35,108
I've never seen anything like this.

566
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,694
Her DNA markers don't match
her original profile.

567
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:39,268
They don't match any profile.

568
00:36:39,393 --> 00:36:42,157
I'm so sorry, Jo.
I can't believe that's you in there.

569
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:43,408
Trust me, it's her.

570
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:46,104
- Just fix me and all's forgiven.
- We're working on it.

571
00:36:46,229 --> 00:36:49,185
The transfiguration process
must have caused her DNA to decompose.

572
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:51,282
It's like her cells are misfiring.

573
00:36:51,407 --> 00:36:52,788
So if we can't restart them...

574
00:36:52,913 --> 00:36:55,003
Being stuck in Julia
is the least of her problems.

575
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:58,621
If her cells stop functioning,
we could lose her for good.

576
00:37:05,516 --> 00:37:09,432
These will stabilize the spasms,
but not for long.

577
00:37:10,072 --> 00:37:12,071
How can my cells be misfiring?

578
00:37:12,577 --> 00:37:15,566
Bodies regulate tiny electrical
impulses that allow cells to function.

579
00:37:16,035 --> 00:37:19,519
Yours aren't getting enough juice.
Your DNA strands are unraveling.

580
00:37:19,644 --> 00:37:22,531
The genetic lines between Jo and Julia
are becoming blurred.

581
00:37:22,881 --> 00:37:26,285
I've been blurry ever since
I was shocked by your stupid scanner.

582
00:37:26,454 --> 00:37:28,504
Again, really sorry about that.

583
00:37:29,158 --> 00:37:30,809
What if we do it again?

584
00:37:31,543 --> 00:37:33,375
One near electrocution
wasn't enough?

585
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,839
My cells are misfiring.

586
00:37:36,459 --> 00:37:39,006
What if we give them
a genetic jump start?

587
00:37:39,175 --> 00:37:41,575
The scanner does have
your original DNA profile.

588
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,803
Programming them into Julia's
device might restart the markers.

589
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,222
- Like a cellular reboot.
- We need Julia to show us how.

590
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:49,272
We're trying
to pinpoint her location.

591
00:37:49,397 --> 00:37:52,144
If this is happening to me,
it must be happening to her too.

592
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:55,147
Can we use the DNA monitor to track her
the way she tracked me?

593
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:56,988
Not if her DNA is degenerating.

594
00:37:57,113 --> 00:37:58,984
It won't match the profile
in the system.

595
00:37:59,976 --> 00:38:02,024
Then try searching for Fargo's.

596
00:38:06,482 --> 00:38:07,910
So you're Julia.

597
00:38:08,675 --> 00:38:10,375
How long have you known?

598
00:38:10,771 --> 00:38:13,123
Guess I always knew
something was off.

599
00:38:13,445 --> 00:38:15,517
I'm really sorry I lied.

600
00:38:15,642 --> 00:38:17,764
I just... I wanted you to notice me.

601
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:20,021
What are you talking about?

602
00:38:20,541 --> 00:38:22,379
You had me at <i>Halo.</i>

603
00:38:23,476 --> 00:38:24,868
Because I look like Jo.

604
00:38:24,993 --> 00:38:28,143
Look, I've tried before,
and you've never responded.

605
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,800
Because I'm clueless
and completely socially awkward.

606
00:38:34,884 --> 00:38:37,229
But I'm sure looking like this
didn't hurt.

607
00:38:37,354 --> 00:38:40,222
Maybe not,
but it's you I connected with.

608
00:38:40,824 --> 00:38:44,207
And I'd really like to connect more.

609
00:38:46,186 --> 00:38:50,306
I have really made
an awful mess of things.

610
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:51,745
Please.

611
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:55,582
I have made my fair share of messes.

612
00:38:56,384 --> 00:38:57,209
Believe me.

613
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,644
I'm not sure this one can be fixed.

614
00:39:02,769 --> 00:39:05,215
Well, with your help,
we think it can.

615
00:39:10,227 --> 00:39:12,866
And you re-routed the plasma impulse
through the electrode array?

616
00:39:12,991 --> 00:39:14,380
Exactly how you said.

617
00:39:14,505 --> 00:39:16,969
But you're both critical,
we can only treat one of you at a time.

618
00:39:17,094 --> 00:39:18,073
Jo goes first.

619
00:39:18,198 --> 00:39:20,649
You're in the worst shape, Julia.
You may not survive the wait.

620
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:21,817
Jo first.

621
00:39:22,251 --> 00:39:23,880
Okay that's it.

622
00:39:24,113 --> 00:39:27,067
I've programmed her original DNA profile
into Julia's transfiguration device.

623
00:39:27,511 --> 00:39:30,450
She's stabilized for the moment.
We need to do this now.

624
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:31,576
Let's go.

625
00:39:41,489 --> 00:39:43,880
Blood pressure's dropping.
Her system's too unstable.

626
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,038
If we stop now,
we may not get another chance.

627
00:39:46,163 --> 00:39:48,719
- She's getting worse.
- Come on, don't give up.

628
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:56,143
- She's not responding.
- Stop.

629
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:57,227
Hang on!

630
00:40:08,647 --> 00:40:09,647
Is she...

631
00:40:11,382 --> 00:40:12,659
Blood pressure's rising.

632
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,620
Her DNA profile
is starting to stabilize!

633
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:31,553
You had me worried there.

634
00:40:35,256 --> 00:40:36,456
How do I look?

635
00:40:38,713 --> 00:40:39,644
Perfect.

636
00:40:46,135 --> 00:40:47,819
You've just done a very brave thing.

637
00:40:49,389 --> 00:40:52,569
Brave would have been staying
inside my own skin to begin with.

638
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,210
It's time to get you back.

639
00:40:57,171 --> 00:40:58,171
Thanks.

640
00:40:59,063 --> 00:41:00,063
It's okay.

641
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:07,798
So, Julia, I have spoken
with the ethics committee.

642
00:41:09,811 --> 00:41:11,551
They're gonna schedule a hearing.

643
00:41:11,945 --> 00:41:12,886
Of course.

644
00:41:13,055 --> 00:41:16,264
I'm so sorry about all
of the trouble that I've caused

645
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,427
with Deputy Lupo and Larry.

646
00:41:19,237 --> 00:41:20,250
I feel awful.

647
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:23,105
In any case, given the fact
that you helped save Deputy Lupo,

648
00:41:23,274 --> 00:41:26,824
and the incredible advances
you made in dna transfiguration,

649
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:30,403
you can stay in Eureka on probation,

650
00:41:31,134 --> 00:41:32,280
pending formal review.

651
00:41:32,808 --> 00:41:33,710
That's great!

652
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,368
Thank you so much.

653
00:41:37,543 --> 00:41:40,789
There are a few things
I would really like to stick around for.

654
00:41:51,117 --> 00:41:53,217
Well, all's well that ends well.

655
00:41:53,467 --> 00:41:54,575
Speaking of which,

656
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,389
I have sent the DNA monitor back
into redevelopment.

657
00:41:58,203 --> 00:42:00,308
You were right.
It wasn't ready.

658
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:02,561
- It wasn't about being right.
- I know.

659
00:42:02,926 --> 00:42:06,148
I still believe it has the potential
to protect a lot of people.

660
00:42:06,841 --> 00:42:08,291
In a perfect world.

661
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:10,735
Well, in a perfect world,
we wouldn't need it.

662
00:42:15,902 --> 00:42:18,272
- How'd you do?
- What?

663
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:19,578
How'd you do?

664
00:42:20,814 --> 00:42:23,165
- I think your record's safe.
- But he passed with high marks.

665
00:42:23,533 --> 00:42:24,791
Never doubted he would.

666
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:27,665
- So same time next year.
- What?

667
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:30,106
Allison said it was gonna be
every two years.

668
00:42:30,231 --> 00:42:32,239
No, you didn't score that high, so.

669
00:42:32,364 --> 00:42:33,300
What?

670
00:42:36,051 --> 00:42:37,227
It's just...

671
00:42:37,352 --> 00:42:39,202
It's good to have you back.

672
00:42:41,591 --> 00:42:43,735
- Should go away more often.
- I'd prefer you didn't.

673
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,194
- Being you was no walk in the park.
- Meaning?

674
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,368
Nothing I couldn't handle alone.

675
00:42:48,493 --> 00:42:50,607
It's just more fun
having you around.

676
00:42:50,732 --> 00:42:53,776
Yeah, tell me about it.
Those 48 hours alone were way too long.

677
00:42:53,901 --> 00:42:56,009
Coulda been worse.
There coulda been two of you.

678
00:42:56,134 --> 00:42:58,150
- Sorry, what?
- Nothing.

679
00:42:58,275 --> 00:42:59,325
Vinspresso?

680
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:02,165
Yeah, make mine a double.

681
00:43:03,406 --> 00:43:05,856
- Did you have to tread water?
- What?
