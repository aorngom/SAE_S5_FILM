00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,613
<i>Previously on</i> Eureka...

2
00:00:01,736 --> 00:00:03,226
I want to continue Kim's research.

3
00:00:03,349 --> 00:00:04,374
So you think

4
00:00:04,647 --> 00:00:06,787
you can put this tragedy behind you?

5
00:00:08,031 --> 00:00:09,412
Never.

6
00:00:09,562 --> 00:00:10,819
<i>According to Nathan Stark</i>

7
00:00:10,956 --> 00:00:13,813
<i>the artifact appears to be dead.</i>

8
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,552
<i>Energy of that magnitude
doesn't just die.</i>

9
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,170
<i>It had to go somewhere.</i>

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,137
<i>How about, this saturday night,</i>

11
00:00:27,274 --> 00:00:31,661
You, me, ribs, root beer,
and espn classic?

12
00:00:31,797 --> 00:00:33,670
They're showing
the lakers game we went to

13
00:00:33,793 --> 00:00:35,474
around your ninth birthday.

14
00:00:35,597 --> 00:00:37,543
- It was my sixth.
- Yeah.

15
00:00:38,035 --> 00:00:39,511
Actually, I was thinking more like

16
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:41,794
red bull and pizza at Pilar's house.

17
00:00:43,205 --> 00:00:47,218
Oh! cos... it's your birthday, I figured
we could do something together.

18
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,030
Just the two of us.

19
00:00:49,714 --> 00:00:50,830
Yeah.

20
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:53,279
That's nice, but...
you know, i'm turning 16,

21
00:00:53,402 --> 00:00:55,336
not 60.

22
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:58,883
Which still qualifies you as a minor.
Wearing that doesn't qualify as a shirt,

23
00:00:59,006 --> 00:01:00,725
so... put on a jacket.

24
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:04,360
- We're in the middlhe of a heat wave.
- <i>Today's forecast calls for heat,</i>

25
00:01:04,483 --> 00:01:06,664
<i>frost, rain, hail,</i>

26
00:01:06,784 --> 00:01:07,825
<i>gale force winds,</i>

27
00:01:07,945 --> 00:01:09,534
<i>and severe lightning.</i>

28
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,305
I'll have fargo give her a checkup.

29
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,624
You know, I just...
I wanna do something normal, like...

30
00:01:17,212 --> 00:01:19,270
a party with my friends.

31
00:01:21,312 --> 00:01:23,677
I think I liked it better
when you were six.

32
00:01:28,995 --> 00:01:30,253
Hey, Pilar.

33
00:01:32,604 --> 00:01:33,984
What are you doing?

34
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,556
Dad!

35
00:01:36,225 --> 00:01:37,456
Hey, Sheriff.

36
00:01:39,895 --> 00:01:40,974
Bye, Sheriff.

37
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,161
Pilar, just so you know,

38
00:01:43,653 --> 00:01:46,154
Zoe already has plans for her birthday.

39
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:49,981
- Bummer.
- Yeah, bummer.

40
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:51,560
Okay, enough mortification.

41
00:01:51,682 --> 00:01:53,144
Have a great day!

42
00:01:57,661 --> 00:02:01,105
I'll remember this when
you're getting arrested on dateline.

43
00:02:02,813 --> 00:02:04,644
Nice. No, we're planning the...

44
00:02:04,795 --> 00:02:06,134
surprise party.

45
00:02:07,255 --> 00:02:08,391
Hey, Kevin.

46
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:12,250
What is... november 3rd, 1957?

47
00:02:12,387 --> 00:02:13,699
Tuesday.

48
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,853
Pretty sure it was a thursday.

49
00:02:15,973 --> 00:02:17,151
Nope. Tuesday.

50
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:19,221
Whatever. Still gonna look it up.

51
00:02:20,027 --> 00:02:22,241
Have a good day, sweetie.
Good luck.

52
00:02:23,342 --> 00:02:24,613
He's in a great mood.

53
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,524
Yeah, he's been... different recently.

54
00:02:27,825 --> 00:02:30,113
- Like he's opening up.
- That's great.

55
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,052
Isn't it?

56
00:02:33,763 --> 00:02:35,430
Yeah. Of course.

57
00:02:35,553 --> 00:02:37,275
- Can we...
- Yeah. Yeah.

58
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,346
So, are you gonna come
to Zoe's surprise party?

59
00:02:41,893 --> 00:02:44,039
Oh, me? I thought
you were into young brunettes.

60
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:46,827
No, no. I'm into old brun...

61
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,492
- That didn't come out right, did it?
- No. No.

62
00:02:49,615 --> 00:02:51,474
Well, we got a D.J. and...

63
00:02:51,597 --> 00:02:54,672
you really haven't lived until
you've seen me dance to hips don't lie.

64
00:02:54,795 --> 00:02:56,926
Well, you're on, old man.

65
00:02:59,497 --> 00:03:01,493
You wanna get a cup of coffee?

66
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:04,721
I got a meeting.

67
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,443
But...

68
00:03:06,593 --> 00:03:08,466
you can ask me again.

69
00:03:13,088 --> 00:03:14,332
- You'd better...
- Yeah.

70
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:17,059
Morning!

71
00:03:20,945 --> 00:03:22,498
It's been six months.

72
00:03:22,618 --> 00:03:24,581
Six months since months since what?

73
00:03:25,278 --> 00:03:28,517
Six months since you said
we would discuss my promotion

74
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,829
in six months.

75
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:33,232
Jo, there's no official position
between yours and mine.

76
00:03:33,615 --> 00:03:35,173
Great. I'll take yours.

77
00:03:35,747 --> 00:03:39,315
Today, you're not gonna bother me.
Today is a great day for Jack Carter.

78
00:03:39,435 --> 00:03:41,494
Zoe has no idea
about her surprise party,

79
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,929
and I have a rain check
for a coffee date.

80
00:03:44,052 --> 00:03:47,796
You said you'd make a call to D.C.
for special consideration.

81
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:51,750
But you're not very good at doing things
that you don't really wanna do.

82
00:03:52,092 --> 00:03:53,308
Tell you what.

83
00:03:53,445 --> 00:03:56,575
Because everything's going well for me
and because I'm such an amazing guy,

84
00:03:56,698 --> 00:03:58,086
I will make the call,

85
00:03:58,206 --> 00:03:59,226
right now.

86
00:04:06,383 --> 00:04:07,383
Hello?

87
00:04:12,902 --> 00:04:14,181
Maybe it's a sign.

88
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:16,374
I think the gods are angry with you.

89
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:20,603
And what makes you think
that they're not angry at you?

90
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,516
Oh, because I'm an amazing guy.

91
00:04:25,837 --> 00:04:26,837
Jack?

92
00:04:27,737 --> 00:04:28,763
Abby?

93
00:04:31,195 --> 00:04:32,535
What are you doing here?

94
00:04:33,396 --> 00:04:36,129
Well, that's a nice way
to welcome your ex-wife.

95

Unpredictable (v. 1.1)

101
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:17,578
- You could have given me a heads up.
- It's her 16th birthday.

102
00:05:17,698 --> 00:05:19,730
You could have given me an invitation.

103
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,248
Thank you, sheriff Lupo.

104
00:05:22,368 --> 00:05:24,240
- It's deputy.
- Deputy.

105
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,561
Until your husband chooses
to promote me.

106
00:05:26,684 --> 00:05:27,721
Uh, ex.

107
00:05:27,926 --> 00:05:29,457
And I said I'd make the call.

108
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:32,666
Jack doesn't like doing things
Jack doesn't wanna do.

109
00:05:32,803 --> 00:05:34,050
Tell me about it.

110
00:05:34,238 --> 00:05:35,495
Phones are back.

111
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,110
- You look good, Jack.
- Does she know you're coming?

112
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:43,476
You look good too, Abby.

113
00:05:43,613 --> 00:05:44,624
Come on.

114
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:47,775
You do.

115
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,567
- It's just...
- You hate surprises.

116
00:05:49,758 --> 00:05:51,493
Especially when
I don't know they're coming.

117
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,879
well, look, we had an agreement,
and it's been a year.

118
00:05:53,999 --> 00:05:55,784
I just assumed we'd talk about it again.

119
00:05:55,907 --> 00:05:57,329
Fine, let's talk.

120
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,205
Deputy.

121
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:04,199
Rub it in.
There's been an accident at the spa.

122
00:06:05,852 --> 00:06:07,086
Eureka has a spa?

123
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,587
Yeah. It's a fission-powered hot spring.

124
00:06:09,881 --> 00:06:12,540
It's members only.
There's been a... malfunction.

125
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:14,360
Can you check it out?

126
00:06:14,702 --> 00:06:16,205
Abby and I are gonna go...

127
00:06:16,437 --> 00:06:17,544
for coffee.

128
00:06:19,783 --> 00:06:20,917
Thanks.

129
00:06:21,956 --> 00:06:23,739
Nothing would make me happier.

130
00:06:23,862 --> 00:06:24,887
Sir.

131
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,760
- Hey, Sheriff.
- Hey, guys.

132
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,951
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Morning.

133
00:06:36,074 --> 00:06:38,466
Did you see them?

134
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,780
Just like... clones.

135
00:06:41,923 --> 00:06:43,235
Very similar.

136
00:06:43,672 --> 00:06:46,229
Why is it only raining over there?

137
00:06:47,732 --> 00:06:49,430
Pacific Northwest.

138
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,422
Look...

139
00:06:52,434 --> 00:06:53,882
Zoe loves it here.

140
00:06:54,074 --> 00:06:56,083
She couldn't be happier,
and she's really thriving.

141
00:06:56,206 --> 00:06:58,365
I think it's the best thing
we could have done for her.

142
00:06:58,488 --> 00:07:01,071
You sure that that's her perception
and not yours?

143
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,231
- Don't do that.
- What?

144
00:07:03,354 --> 00:07:05,555
The shrink thing you do
where you mak, you know,

145
00:07:05,678 --> 00:07:07,470
You sound like you're the better parent.

146
00:07:07,591 --> 00:07:10,174
It's called insecurity,
and it stems from the person listening,

147
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:11,869
not the person speaking.

148
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:15,163
And remind me again why I used to think
it was fun to fight with you.

149
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,063
Because you like a challenge.

150
00:07:17,489 --> 00:07:19,061
<i>With these unstable pressure systems,</i>

151
00:07:19,184 --> 00:07:21,756
<i>I predict a whopper
of a storm is coming our way.</i>

152
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,847
<i>I'm pete puhlman for Storm Watch.</i>

153
00:07:24,325 --> 00:07:26,274
So, I thought I'd stay a week,

154
00:07:26,394 --> 00:07:27,405
and...

155
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:30,116
we'd have a party and we'd still have
two days before Zoe and I...

156
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:32,822
My special double yolk quail egg omelet

157
00:07:32,945 --> 00:07:34,444
with estonian caviar

158
00:07:34,564 --> 00:07:36,902
and basil grafted from
an italian monastery.

159
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,039
Thank, Vincent.

160
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,910
Oh, my god. Is that truffle oil?

161
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:41,050
Yes!

162
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,044
Finall, a refined palate!

163
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:46,340
The last time I served it to him,
he asked for ketchup.

164
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,590
On the house.
Except for the muffin.

165
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:53,459
Let's talk.

166
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,001
Look at those two.

167
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,574
Oh, now I just feel sick.

168
00:07:58,694 --> 00:08:00,378
Hey, what a surprise!

169
00:08:00,498 --> 00:08:02,730
Hate surprises. Meeting, huh?

170
00:08:02,891 --> 00:08:03,908
Brunettes, huh?

171
00:08:04,028 --> 00:08:06,329
I was just telling Jack
what a striking couple you are.

172
00:08:06,534 --> 00:08:09,084
- Well, thank you.
- Thank you. And you are...

173
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:12,181
Jack's evil ex-wife, Dr. Abby Carter.

174
00:08:13,897 --> 00:08:15,319
Dr. Allison Blake.

175
00:08:16,002 --> 00:08:17,382
Dr. Nathan Stark.

176
00:08:18,817 --> 00:08:20,063
All these doctors.

177
00:08:20,186 --> 00:08:21,396
Your worst nightmare, Jack.

178
00:08:21,516 --> 00:08:24,395
He used to hate it when I dragged him
around to my alumni functions.

179
00:08:24,518 --> 00:08:26,363
He called it death by dull.

180
00:08:26,718 --> 00:08:28,720
He is very clever.

181
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,478
So... will you be staying at the house?

182
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:34,694
- No.
- Yes.

183
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,613
We're... Do... We're...

184
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,472
setting her up at Beverly's.

185
00:08:41,226 --> 00:08:44,615
Well... then I guess I'll see you
at Zoe's party.

186
00:08:44,738 --> 00:08:46,152
I hear there'll be dancing.

187
00:08:46,753 --> 00:08:49,344
Oh, Jack and I won
a macarena contest in Cabo once.

188
00:08:49,464 --> 00:08:51,290
Do you remember that, Jack?

189
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,667
I can't wait for the party.

190
00:08:56,775 --> 00:08:59,837
You may think you've put
the past behind you but...

191
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,106
these things take time.

192
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,333
The heart doesn't heal overnight.

193
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,260
Nor should it.

194
00:09:07,003 --> 00:09:09,416
That's why it's important
to find constructive ways

195
00:09:09,536 --> 00:09:11,985
- to work through the pain.
- Which is precisely why

196
00:09:12,105 --> 00:09:14,858
I want to continue Kim's research.

197
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:16,635
Is that the only reason?

198
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:18,910
Does it matter?

199
00:09:19,077 --> 00:09:22,577
When you're asking to work at the most
advanced research facility on the planet

200
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,053
I'm afraid it does matter.

201
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,740
And does everybody at G.D.
fall under this level of scrutiny?

202
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,156
Of course.

203
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,796
Including Kim.

204
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,613
Were you seeing kim?

205
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,417
On and off.

206
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:39,232
More during the months
leading up to her...

207
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:41,146
to the accident.

208
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,748
But you never talked about her research.

209
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:48,377
Up to a point. My security level
doesn't cover section five projects.

210
00:09:48,497 --> 00:09:50,706
But she told me what she could.

211
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,353
So you never visited her lab.

212
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,374
No.

213
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,360
Right.

214
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,371
Hum. Sorry.

215
00:10:03,491 --> 00:10:05,129
Go ahead. We're done.

216
00:10:05,613 --> 00:10:06,789
Same time tomorrow?

217
00:10:06,946 --> 00:10:08,069
Absolutely.

218
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:09,727
Yeah?

219
00:10:13,523 --> 00:10:14,557
Hot, yeah?

220
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,604
- Yeah.
- Yes, I've noticed.

221
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,320
It's crazy.
I come to turn on the nuclear bubbles,

222
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,120
and look what I see.

223
00:10:23,171 --> 00:10:24,649
What... what is this?

224
00:10:27,804 --> 00:10:29,332
My first big case.

225
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:32,187
<i>So is Zoe excited at all?</i>

226
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,756
Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure, I guess.

227
00:10:34,924 --> 00:10:35,957
You guess.

228
00:10:38,107 --> 00:10:39,399
Abby, we should talk.

229
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,889
Oh, god, Jack.

230
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:43,431
Never thought it was settled.
Assumed we're gonna talk about.

231
00:10:43,551 --> 00:10:45,195
- We had an agreement.
- That was before.

232
00:10:45,315 --> 00:10:46,487
Before what?

233
00:10:48,135 --> 00:10:50,393
Before probably
the greatest year of my life.

234
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,033
And when were you planning
on sharing this with me?

235
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,907
I don't know...

236
00:10:57,913 --> 00:11:01,227
The next time you called.
I didn't plan on you just showing up.

237
00:11:01,347 --> 00:11:03,024
God, Jack, you know, you've had a year.

238
00:11:03,144 --> 00:11:06,088
This is just like you.
This is so unfair. It's...

239
00:11:08,374 --> 00:11:09,386
It's snowing.

240
00:11:16,172 --> 00:11:17,430
What is it with this place?

241
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,067
I...

242
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,450
Hold on.

243
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,238
Yeah, Jo, it's not a good time
right now. It's, uh...

244
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,429
snowing.

245
00:11:27,746 --> 00:11:28,757
What?

246
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,197
Did... did you call Henry?

247
00:11:31,914 --> 00:11:34,480
Okay. Um... I'll be there
as soon as I get Abby settled.

248
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,619
- Thanks.
- Abby is not settling this time, Jack.

249
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,010
We didn't close the entire spa.

250
00:11:50,131 --> 00:11:51,800
No reasonable cause of panic.

251
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,580
I've got sciatica and no one's
ever told me about this place?

252
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,237
It's on G.D. property, Carter.

253
00:11:58,371 --> 00:12:00,334
You guys don't belong here.
Employees only.

254
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,921
We're here on official business.

255
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,996
The grotto closure.

256
00:12:04,154 --> 00:12:05,686
Yeah, inconvenient.

257
00:12:05,924 --> 00:12:07,632
At least Alma's still giving Shiatsu.

258
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,482
You have shiatsu?

259
00:12:11,783 --> 00:12:13,241
Carter, off this way.

260
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,908
Is that embroidered?

261
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,013
Membership has its privileges.

262
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,884
You mean those brainiacs use a nuclear
reactor to heat their whirlpools?

263
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:27,750
Not the reactor. Just the byproduct
from the core cooling system.

264
00:12:32,469 --> 00:12:34,948
This is a byproduct of a cooling system?

265
00:12:35,071 --> 00:12:37,416
Flash freezing? Not likely.

266
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:39,624
Well, we'd better get an I.D.

267
00:12:54,582 --> 00:12:55,731
Okay...

268
00:12:56,004 --> 00:12:57,344
Which piece do we start with?

269
00:13:01,237 --> 00:13:04,023
Still think these nuclear
hot tubs are safe?

270
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:08,748
You know, temperatures would have had to
have dropped to minus 460° fahrenheit.

271
00:13:08,883 --> 00:13:10,712
- Like that.
- Yeah, but you see what happens

272
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,652
when they change
the natural order of things?

273
00:13:12,772 --> 00:13:15,622
Everything's under control, then
somebody throws a wrench in something

274
00:13:15,824 --> 00:13:17,959
working perfectly fine
for unselfish reasons.

275
00:13:18,094 --> 00:13:20,810
Then your life is shattered,
and she's blaming you.

276
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,964
What?

277
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,180
Are we still talking about the reactor?

278
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,882
- Yeah.
- What?

279
00:13:26,287 --> 00:13:28,916
Okay, so how are we
gonna get an I.D. now?

280
00:13:29,057 --> 00:13:30,764
Just look for a finger.

281
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,057
How about a... a thumb?

282
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:43,025
You sure that's a thumb?

283
00:13:43,309 --> 00:13:45,017
Only if it has a print.

284
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,497
Baxter, Neil.

285
00:14:04,631 --> 00:14:08,098
G.D. employee. number 185627.

286
00:14:08,808 --> 00:14:10,022
It's a thumb.

287
00:14:10,556 --> 00:14:11,880
<i>I can't explain the death.</i>

288
00:14:12,037 --> 00:14:14,957
Scientifically, the reactor just
doesn't make sense. I mean,

289
00:14:15,077 --> 00:14:18,135
if the hot springs had boiled, i'd say,
you know, maybe there was a leak.

290
00:14:18,255 --> 00:14:20,383
Henry mentioned something
about the cooling system?

291
00:14:20,503 --> 00:14:22,902
Which doesn't go below 20 degrees.
Skiing weather.

292
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:24,954
Okay, so like the snow at Beverly's.

293
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,220
I don't know, Carter.
Why don't you look into it?

294
00:14:27,357 --> 00:14:29,349
Unless you're too busy
with personal matters.

295
00:14:31,097 --> 00:14:32,198
Did I miss something?

296
00:14:32,574 --> 00:14:35,406
I... I just want to get this figured out
as quickly as possible.

297
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,418
Oh, my god. You're jealous.

298
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,664
- Of?
- What do you think?

299
00:14:40,619 --> 00:14:42,716
- Oh, please.
- Come on.

300
00:14:42,851 --> 00:14:45,417
- You have nothing to worry about.
- I'm not worried.

301
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,914
You know what, let's just
stay focused on work

302
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,572
so we can avoid these awkward moments.

303
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:56,326
These awkward moments are
the only social life I have left.

304
00:14:59,835 --> 00:15:00,846
Check this out.

305
00:15:01,027 --> 00:15:02,940
This was Baxter, the frozen guy's lab.

306
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,157
I've been filling in sometimes.

307
00:15:06,942 --> 00:15:09,227
Baxter was conducting
a real-time field study

308
00:15:09,384 --> 00:15:11,347
on the mating habits
of a tribe in Tanzania.

309
00:15:11,467 --> 00:15:13,709
You see those two? It's Danny and Sandy.

310
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,221
They've been together
since they were teenagers.

311
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,034
How about the jumpy one?

312
00:15:18,191 --> 00:15:21,483
Tom. He's been like that
since he hooked up with Katie.

313
00:15:22,634 --> 00:15:25,645
Exactly how much time have you spent
down here, Fargo?

314
00:15:27,377 --> 00:15:29,332
Baxter put up a live webcast every day

315
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:32,686
to poll viewer reaction
to the relationship dynamics.

316
00:15:33,334 --> 00:15:34,727
Better than the Bachelor.

317
00:15:34,918 --> 00:15:36,578
Was he working with anyone else?

318
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:38,621
I wouldn't call it working.

319
00:15:39,207 --> 00:15:41,620
He was known to do
a lot of field testing

320
00:15:41,786 --> 00:15:44,705
with the female lab techs,
if you know what I mean.

321
00:15:44,921 --> 00:15:46,682
Gave new meaning to the term wild

322
00:15:46,802 --> 00:15:48,416
- monkey...
- Please stop that.

323
00:16:33,528 --> 00:16:35,098
... a total mystery to me.

324
00:16:35,218 --> 00:16:36,513
I'm scared, Henry.

325
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,663
In three days, Zoe turns 16.

326
00:16:39,112 --> 00:16:42,719
Any man who says he understands women
is either naive or a liar.

327
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:46,503
Apparently, Baxter did.
He was the Casanova of section three.

328
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,068
I've questioned six women who thought
he was god's gift to their gender,

329
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:52,245
even when there wasn't enough
of him to go around.

330
00:16:52,365 --> 00:16:54,111
- There certainly is now.
- Yeah.

331
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,272
What did allison say?

332
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,824
- She doesn't think it was the reactor.
- She's right.

333
00:16:58,454 --> 00:17:00,978
The cooling system could not
create a temperature that low

334
00:17:01,112 --> 00:17:04,972
to freeze tissue that fast unless we
were into China Syndrome times five.

335
00:17:05,146 --> 00:17:06,966
Well, I have Jo retracing his last day.

336
00:17:07,123 --> 00:17:10,244
It's gonna take me a little time to get
you an accurate time of death.

337
00:17:10,376 --> 00:17:12,040
I have to wait for this tissue to thaw.

338
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,325
Yeah, or we could just read his watch.

339
00:17:16,146 --> 00:17:18,177
- Got 12... 26.
- 26.

340
00:17:18,485 --> 00:17:21,226
You know, if we were
that smart about women...

341
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,881
Oh, no, what time...

342
00:17:26,147 --> 00:17:27,164
Zoe.

343
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:29,300
- Oop.
- Yep. got it.

344
00:17:29,945 --> 00:17:32,333
So... what's the one next to mercury?

345
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:35,428
Gold... every girl's favorite element.

346
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:41,939
Zoe.

347
00:17:43,043 --> 00:17:44,279
That's my mom.

348
00:17:52,463 --> 00:17:53,721
You didn't tell me.

349
00:17:54,377 --> 00:17:56,130
I wanted to surprise you.

350
00:17:58,639 --> 00:18:00,010
I hate surprises.

351
00:18:00,377 --> 00:18:02,197
You're just like your dad.

352
00:18:03,488 --> 00:18:06,085
We've got so much
to talk about. Come on.

353
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:12,734
Hey, sweetie.

354
00:18:13,013 --> 00:18:15,642
I thought i'd swing by
and pick you up...

355
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:19,592
She promised...

356
00:18:20,702 --> 00:18:22,365
No, it's terrific!

357
00:18:22,594 --> 00:18:24,193
I mean, yeah, surprise!

358
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:25,414
Just, um...

359
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:29,203
don't talk to her till I get there.
All right. Bye.

360
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:46,604
Okay, I give up. So where do you live?

361
00:18:46,895 --> 00:18:47,951
In there.

362
00:18:49,178 --> 00:18:50,301
Both of you?

363
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,577
It's underground.

364
00:18:51,712 --> 00:18:54,341
Oh. Well, that makes so much more sense.

365
00:19:01,377 --> 00:19:02,417
Hi, Jack.

366
00:19:02,861 --> 00:19:03,861
Hi, dad.

367
00:19:04,302 --> 00:19:06,189
Hi. Um, what are you doing?

368
00:19:06,347 --> 00:19:08,430
I asked you to wait.
Has she spoken to you?

369
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,064
- What?
- You told her.

370
00:19:10,184 --> 00:19:12,766
This is so like you! You're just tearing
whatever's good for you.

371
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:14,322
I'm gonna look like the bad guy,

372
00:19:14,442 --> 00:19:16,733
just because you want to come here
and take away my kid.

373
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,961
What are you talking about?

374
00:19:24,404 --> 00:19:25,418
You didn't tell her.

375
00:19:25,553 --> 00:19:27,400
No. But you just did.

376
00:19:27,535 --> 00:19:30,247
Can someone just treat me like a person
and tell me what's going on?

377
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:33,238
Your mom and I had an agreement
when you came to live here.

378
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:36,013
- What kind of agreement?
- I just wanted us to be a family.

379
00:19:36,146 --> 00:19:37,992
Just you and me, you know...

380
00:19:38,246 --> 00:19:39,453
with no time limit.

381
00:19:40,422 --> 00:19:42,480
- But there was a time limit.
- It was a year,

382
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,389
and then you would come back
to L.A. with me

383
00:19:44,509 --> 00:19:46,146
- and you to tell her.
- Don't blame me.

384
00:19:46,281 --> 00:19:49,133
Okay, that's enough.
This isn't about either of you, okay?

385
00:19:49,253 --> 00:19:51,698
You've already ruined your own lives.
Just leave mine alone.

386
00:19:51,923 --> 00:19:53,489
- Zoe...
- It's so...

387
00:19:54,342 --> 00:19:55,735
What is happening?

388
00:20:09,262 --> 00:20:10,560
S.A.R.A.H., door.

389
00:20:12,452 --> 00:20:14,025
What the hell was that?

390
00:20:14,227 --> 00:20:15,793
<i>That would be a severe dust storm</i>

391
00:20:15,913 --> 00:20:18,580
<i>precipitated by
unstable pressure systems.</i>

392
00:20:18,894 --> 00:20:20,383
What the hell was that?

393
00:20:20,528 --> 00:20:22,676
That... that was, uh, the house.

394
00:20:23,686 --> 00:20:25,576
Abby, House. House, Abby.

395
00:20:25,733 --> 00:20:26,986
This is that Abby?

396
00:20:27,146 --> 00:20:29,410
- Your house talks to you?
- Yeah.

397
00:20:29,803 --> 00:20:32,086
- Uh, listen, Zoe. We...
- I'm going to my room.

398
00:20:32,212 --> 00:20:34,583
Sweetie, wait, wait.
we have to talk about this.

399
00:20:34,857 --> 00:20:36,674
Just give her some space.

400
00:20:37,393 --> 00:20:39,145
Oh, so now you're the expert.

401
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:42,453
Yeah. I am. She's a different kid
and i'm a different parent

402
00:20:42,573 --> 00:20:45,730
than I was a year ago. And I know I was
awful, but you gotta cut me some slack

403
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:48,699
while I figure out why we almost ended
up in kansas. Look, hey, uh,

404
00:20:48,819 --> 00:20:51,941
S.A.R.A.H., you said we'd have some
freaky weather today. How'd you know it?

405
00:20:52,061 --> 00:20:55,833
<i>I receive weather updates every
quarter hour from the eureka channel.</i>

406
00:20:57,195 --> 00:20:58,206
From the weather guy?

407
00:20:58,806 --> 00:21:02,712
<i>Mr. Puhlman prefers meteorologist.
He's a little sensitive about it.</i>

408
00:21:02,832 --> 00:21:04,509
- Okay. I gotta talk to him.
- No, no,

409
00:21:04,629 --> 00:21:06,752
you have to talk to me and our daughter.

410
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:09,356
I know, and I will. I just have
to deal with this first. And

411
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:12,278
- No, I can't go into it.
- Sure. Go to work.

412
00:21:12,817 --> 00:21:14,250
Your hiding place.

413
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,636
Hey, Jo, it's Carter. Look...

414
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:21,160
<i>You're much shorter
than I pictured you, Abby.

415
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,911
A volatile storm system
is taking us to level yellow,

416
00:21:25,031 --> 00:21:27,322
so everyone is strongly
encouraged to stay indoors.

417
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,974
The cumulator 2100
is predicting high winds,

418
00:21:30,094 --> 00:21:31,551
sporadic downpours,

419
00:21:31,816 --> 00:21:33,667
and more frost on Socrates Avenue

420
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:37,559
so keep it tuned to storm watch, because
we're in for one wild ride, folks.

421
00:21:37,683 --> 00:21:39,054
I'm Pete Puhlman.

422
00:21:42,941 --> 00:21:44,066
Sorry about that.

423
00:21:44,186 --> 00:21:46,044
- Emergency updates all day long.
- Yeah.

424
00:21:46,201 --> 00:21:47,947
- How can I help you?
- I don't know.

425
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:50,311
I hope you can tell me what's
going on with the weather.

426
00:21:50,452 --> 00:21:52,339
- Yeah, no problem.
- Okay.

427
00:21:54,495 --> 00:21:55,506
See...

428
00:21:56,417 --> 00:21:57,745
Cumulator 2100.

429
00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:03,307
The most sophisticated meteorological
predictor in the industrialized world.

430
00:22:03,427 --> 00:22:06,506
Wow. If I had a nickel
for every time i'd heard that...

431
00:22:09,981 --> 00:22:10,992
Continue.

432
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:17,871
It all began with a severe temperature
drop last night over the hot springs

433
00:22:18,024 --> 00:22:21,775
which precipitated a chain reaction
of unstable pressure systems.

434
00:22:21,943 --> 00:22:25,437
The rain downtown, the snow on
the north side, the dust storm, all...

435
00:22:25,557 --> 00:22:27,861
Yeah. All caused
by the initial drop in pressure.

436
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,007
Watch.

437
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:31,755
The pressure drop began here.

438
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:34,882
by the time it hit the hot springs,
insta-freeze.

439
00:22:35,616 --> 00:22:38,082
So the freaky weather
didn't cause the freeze,

440
00:22:38,262 --> 00:22:40,195
the freeze caused the freaky weather.

441
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:41,663
Exactly.

442
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:45,061
Okay, so the question is what's there?

443
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:57,929
- Hi, Allison.
- Hi, Beverly.

444
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:00,524
- This is, uh, crazy weather.
- I know.

445
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,077
I appreciate you coming.

446
00:23:02,242 --> 00:23:04,566
I'm always happy to come
to the office for a session.

447
00:23:04,746 --> 00:23:07,013
Actually, I didn't call you here for me.
It's henry.

448
00:23:07,388 --> 00:23:09,590
I need him cleared to work at G.D.

449
00:23:12,331 --> 00:23:14,532
Well, our sessions are going well.

450
00:23:14,858 --> 00:23:16,848
I think maybe in another few weeks...

451
00:23:16,968 --> 00:23:19,131
I'm afraid I can't wait that long.

452
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:23,254
Henry's in a fragile state of mind,
Allison. He's not ready.

453
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:26,593
I'd like to help you out,
but I have to put him first.

454
00:23:26,846 --> 00:23:30,171
I'm afraid in good conscience
I can't sign off on this.

455
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:33,643
All right. Then i'll do it myself.

456
00:23:37,507 --> 00:23:38,540
Fargo.

457
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:13,557
It's me.

458
00:24:14,182 --> 00:24:17,283
Henry Deacon is being cleared
to return to Global.

459
00:24:17,862 --> 00:24:18,883
I know.

460
00:24:19,223 --> 00:24:22,506
I'm coming in for a debriefing.
We need to strategize.

461
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,690
- Jo, I sent you a picture with a map...
- Got it.

462
00:24:27,825 --> 00:24:29,239
- Check out what's there.
- Did it.

463
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,807
- Pretty...
- Good lead. I know.

464
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:33,554
So if you let me do my job
for a change... Emphasis on change...

465
00:24:33,674 --> 00:24:35,619
Jo, I have enough women
who are mad at me today.

466
00:24:35,739 --> 00:24:37,990
- I found a cabin.
- What? Where?

467
00:24:38,574 --> 00:24:41,581
Right smack-dab in the middle.
And it's owned by Dr. Steven Whiticus.

468
00:24:41,739 --> 00:24:42,761
And you'll never guess

469
00:24:42,889 --> 00:24:44,918
who was the last person to call baxter

470
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:46,154
the night he died.

471
00:24:46,292 --> 00:24:47,978
Steven Whiticus.

472
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,929
Well, no. Um, His wife. Wendy.

473
00:24:51,548 --> 00:24:54,208
Baxter was field testing the wife?

474
00:24:55,491 --> 00:24:59,153
Maybe the husband found out
and, you know, crime of passion.

475
00:24:59,285 --> 00:25:01,857
Okay. I'll check out the cabin.
You check out the doctor.

476
00:25:01,992 --> 00:25:04,486
- She's gone, Jack. She ran away.
- What?

477
00:25:04,726 --> 00:25:06,165
It's just like before.

478
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:08,832
All right, did she
take anything with her?

479
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,864
No, she just... she left
the house by herself.

480
00:25:12,981 --> 00:25:15,161
Well, she does that all the time.

481
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:17,799
I mean, she's not gone, Abby. She's 16.

482
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,338
Yeah, but how do you know for sure?

483
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:20,465
Because I do.

484
00:25:21,025 --> 00:25:23,537
I know her. She wouldn't run away.
Not like that. Not anymore.

485
00:25:23,657 --> 00:25:26,861
Oh, so I'm the only parent that she runs
away from. Is that what you're saying?

486
00:25:26,981 --> 00:25:30,296
I'm not saying that. what I am saying
is that things have changed.

487
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:33,219
You haven't changed, Jack.
You've always put your work before us.

488
00:25:33,374 --> 00:25:36,468
That's why she started
running away to begin with.

489
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,130
Okay.

490
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:41,927
- Let's go.
- What?

491
00:25:42,724 --> 00:25:46,292
Look, I have to work, so if you
wanna talk, you have to come with me.

492
00:25:46,535 --> 00:25:47,546
See?

493
00:25:47,726 --> 00:25:48,737
Change.

494
00:25:50,508 --> 00:25:52,081
I'll call from Whiticus's cabin.

495
00:25:59,313 --> 00:26:00,739
She's still not answering.

496
00:26:01,134 --> 00:26:02,766
It's because she's still pissed.

497
00:26:02,886 --> 00:26:04,541
And whose fault is that?

498
00:26:05,281 --> 00:26:06,652
Oh, well, mine, obviously.

499
00:26:06,777 --> 00:26:09,403
Because everything bad that happens
would be my fault.

500
00:26:10,506 --> 00:26:12,709
Well, I wouldn't say everything bad.

501
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,285
- She'll call when she's ready.
- Yeah.

502
00:26:17,141 --> 00:26:18,745
- That's her.
- Good.

503
00:26:18,895 --> 00:26:22,574
Hey, sweetie, thanks for calling.
we really app... yeah. Yeah.

504
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,957
Yeah, you're right. I was wrong. I...

505
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:28,497
s...

506
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:31,783
What did she say?

507
00:26:33,553 --> 00:26:34,633
She's fine.

508
00:26:38,276 --> 00:26:41,081
She never wants to talk to either one
of us again. But she's fine.

509
00:26:41,221 --> 00:26:44,003
She spends the night at a friend
of hers. Pilar's. Nice girl, actually.

510
00:26:44,123 --> 00:26:46,569
Good influence. I think you'd like her.
Uh, wait here.

511
00:26:46,704 --> 00:26:48,946
I'im gonna go take a look around.

512
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:05,472
Welcome to Eureka.

513
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,787
So you were the last person

514
00:27:07,944 --> 00:27:10,146
to see Neil Baxter alive last night.

515
00:27:10,357 --> 00:27:12,594
Relationships are so complicated.

516
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,327
I mean...

517
00:27:17,621 --> 00:27:19,014
I love my husband.

518
00:27:19,987 --> 00:27:21,605
He's a brilliant man.

519
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,214
It's just that, uh,

520
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,261
Neil gave me something
I haven't had for so long.

521
00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:33,339
Passion can be so powerful.

522
00:27:33,729 --> 00:27:36,830
Okay, so you two were
together last night?

523
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,031
At the cabin until about midnight.

524
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:44,448
And then I drove home
and Neil went to the Hot Springs.

525
00:27:45,147 --> 00:27:47,236
He always liked to soak after...

526
00:27:47,803 --> 00:27:48,814
<i>Wendy!</i>

527
00:27:48,956 --> 00:27:50,799
<i>Come take a look at this!</i>

528
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,067
Mrs. Whiticus.

529
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,056
I'm going to have to ask
your husband some questions.

530
00:28:08,194 --> 00:28:09,362
Darling, look.

531
00:28:11,676 --> 00:28:12,710
A typhoon.

532
00:28:37,088 --> 00:28:38,510
That was crazy, huh?

533
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,181
The... the storm.

534
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:41,837
Yeah.

535
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,671
So you wanna talk about it?

536
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:51,538
It's been such a hard year,
Jack, you know, all by myself.

537
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:54,617
And I've been thinking about so many
things, you know? Like...

538
00:28:54,754 --> 00:28:57,273
how we got to this place after 15 years.

539
00:28:58,664 --> 00:29:00,439
I miss Zoe so much.

540
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,013
and I hate to admit it, but

541
00:29:04,171 --> 00:29:05,586
I missed you too.

542
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:10,910
- Are you listening to what i'm saying?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just give me a sec.

543
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,387
Unbelievable.

544
00:29:27,149 --> 00:29:28,396
What the hell?

545
00:29:29,709 --> 00:29:32,159
Yeah... does this look like a...

546
00:29:32,609 --> 00:29:34,249
crazy weather machine to you?

547
00:29:34,396 --> 00:29:36,014
Oh, like I would know?

548
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:37,887
Good point.

549
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,290
Hold on.

550
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,426
Jo, it's me. I'm out at whiticus's
cabin. I think I found something.

551
00:29:45,546 --> 00:29:48,412
<i>Yeah. I've tried to get a hold of you.
I found something in his basement.

552
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:52,820
He's created mini-climates
using some kind of microwave technology.

553
00:29:52,966 --> 00:29:54,742
<i>Any chance it looks like a...

554
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:57,176
<i>big, scary satellite dish?

555
00:29:57,459 --> 00:29:59,670
Yeah, based on the schematics. Yeah.

556
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:03,061
And if what I'm seeing down here
is any indication

557
00:30:03,181 --> 00:30:04,872
of what you're gonna see out there,

558
00:30:04,992 --> 00:30:06,600
it's gonna be a bumpy night.

559
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,518
Well, keep him there.
I'm on my way over.

560
00:30:14,747 --> 00:30:15,936
Look, Abby...

561
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,240
I know.

562
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:20,930
Can we talk about it another time?

563
00:30:21,504 --> 00:30:22,857
No need. Just...

564
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:25,112
just take me home.

565
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,772
I think I've seen enough. I'm gonna have
to take you in for questioning.

566
00:30:38,909 --> 00:30:41,012
- What?
- Dr. Whiticus, you're under arrest

567
00:30:41,132 --> 00:30:43,070
for the murder of Neil Baxter.

568
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:45,475
- I don't understand.
- Please, you're making a mistake.

569
00:30:45,598 --> 00:30:48,099
- He can't leave the house.
- You found out baxter and your wife

570
00:30:48,236 --> 00:30:50,295
were having an affair,
you froze him with a giant...

571
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:51,517
Okay, stop!

572
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,635
He couldn't have killed anyone.

573
00:30:55,002 --> 00:30:56,847
He's practically blind.

574
00:30:58,375 --> 00:31:01,437
His eyes are too sensitive
to leave the house, even at night.

575
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:03,104
We have special lights,

576
00:31:03,241 --> 00:31:05,018
filters on all the windows.

577
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:07,355
Could have had an accomplice.

578
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:12,084
Why would I want to kill the man who
finally brought happiness to my wife?

579
00:31:19,657 --> 00:31:21,980
Hey, look who made it for pizza!

580
00:31:23,976 --> 00:31:26,070
There's not gonna be any pizza.

581
00:31:26,231 --> 00:31:29,175
Come on, sweetie.
Can you wait for mommy in the car?

582
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,830
What's going on, Allie?

583
00:31:34,462 --> 00:31:36,827
Nathan, I'm going to ask you a question,

584
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,874
and I swear, if you lie to me...

585
00:31:39,997 --> 00:31:41,268
I'm listening.

586
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,796
I know about KB-201.

587
00:31:48,966 --> 00:31:51,208
- I really wanted to tell you.
- Tell me what?

588
00:31:51,427 --> 00:31:54,739
That you brought my son to study him?
That you put his life at risk?

589
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:59,330
The only reason we studied him
is to make sure his life isn't at risk.

590
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,223
What are you talking about?

591
00:32:01,343 --> 00:32:03,675
Kevin has a connection to the artifact.

592
00:32:04,909 --> 00:32:07,300
He draws pictures. He makes models.

593
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,747
He knows exact geometric details.

594
00:32:11,112 --> 00:32:13,340
We've been trying to understand why.

595
00:32:13,504 --> 00:32:16,210
He has been different ever since
that accident in section five.

596
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:18,336
He was down there,
and you didn't tell me!

597
00:32:18,456 --> 00:32:21,964
Alli, I would never put him
in harm's way. You have to know that.

598
00:32:22,087 --> 00:32:24,315
I don't know anything anymore, Nathan.

599
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:26,940
Get in the car.

600
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,223
Where'd this come from?

601
00:32:35,346 --> 00:32:36,425
Make it stop!

602
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,503
It's okay, baby.

603
00:32:39,897 --> 00:32:42,010
Make it stop. Make it stop.

604
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:44,160
It's okay, baby. It's gonna pass.

605
00:32:44,366 --> 00:32:47,674
Make it stop!

606
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:55,110
Please tell me what's happening.

607
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,970
I don't know yet.

608
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,192
You knew about the affair?

609
00:33:02,343 --> 00:33:04,511
Well, my eyes may
not work very well, but...

610
00:33:04,634 --> 00:33:06,570
it doesn't mean I'm totally blind.

611
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,218
I always knew
I wasn't enough for wendy, even...

612
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:11,240
before the accident.

613
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,820
The glasses help you see.

614
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,390
Infrared wi-fi signal lets them augment

615
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,890
the little bit of retinal usage
that I retain.

616
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:21,420
The... array thing
we found at the cabin.

617
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,035
Could that have caused the frost?

618
00:33:23,172 --> 00:33:24,529
Well, I designed it to refreeze

619
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:26,219
the melting polar ice caps,

620
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:28,745
to bring rain
to drought-plagued nations. But...

621
00:33:29,209 --> 00:33:32,038
there were calibration problems
that I was working to fix.

622
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,171
That's what led to my accident.

623
00:33:34,964 --> 00:33:37,684
I decided to stop the project
because it was too dangerous,

624
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,226
and I didn't want it
to harm anyone else.

625
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:43,098
- Would Wendy?
- What possible reason would she have to

626
00:33:43,218 --> 00:33:44,676
want to hurt anyone?

627
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,068
She was at the cabin that night.

628
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,681
and she wasn't baxter's only...

629
00:33:50,186 --> 00:33:51,448
experiment.

630
00:33:51,708 --> 00:33:53,362
You know, jealousy is a very powerful...

631
00:33:53,485 --> 00:33:55,721
You said the device went off at 12:26.

632
00:33:55,841 --> 00:33:57,189
- Yeah.
- But I called her

633
00:33:57,309 --> 00:33:59,320
the minute I heard
the frost predicted on the news.

634
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,802
She was home by midnight.

635
00:34:01,656 --> 00:34:04,138
The 11:00 news
with Pete what's-his-name?

636
00:34:04,258 --> 00:34:05,751
- The weatherman.
- Meteorologist.

637
00:34:05,871 --> 00:34:07,727
He's pretty touchy about it.

638
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:10,331
Yeah. well,
Peter's always been very touchy.

639
00:34:10,468 --> 00:34:12,559
He was part of
the dish installation team.

640
00:34:12,696 --> 00:34:14,144
He's always craved the limelight.

641
00:34:14,363 --> 00:34:16,511
If he hadn't have predicted
the ice storm, I guess...

642
00:34:16,634 --> 00:34:18,355
Yeah, then maybe
it wouldn't have happened.

643
00:34:18,475 --> 00:34:20,350
Jo, can you watch him?

644
00:34:21,757 --> 00:34:24,326
Hey, Allison. It's Carter.
Meet me at the TV station.

645
00:34:26,477 --> 00:34:28,746
Hey, Pete,
it's getting pretty nasty out there.

646
00:34:28,883 --> 00:34:30,400
You have any good news for us?

647
00:34:30,714 --> 00:34:32,562
Well, it's a category four ice storm,

648
00:34:32,685 --> 00:34:35,897
which will reach full strength
in the next few hours.

649
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,276
It must be a weatherman's dream.

650
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:40,986
My job is to serve the community,

651
00:34:41,109 --> 00:34:42,770
which you should be evacuatin, Sheriff.

652
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:44,279
Because this will be a direct hit.

653
00:34:44,402 --> 00:34:47,062
It's amazing how accurately
you've predicted each hit.

654
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:48,211
I know.

655
00:34:48,331 --> 00:34:50,293
My cumulator technology is...

656
00:34:50,553 --> 00:34:53,055
- very precise.
- Yeah!

657
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:56,827
When you predicted that ice storm
at 11:18, we were in a heat wave.

658
00:34:56,950 --> 00:35:00,259
Who would have thought an hour later you
could be ice skating on the hot springs?

659
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,841
- Apparently, not Neil Baxter.
- Yeah.

660
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:05,169
His death was tragic.

661
00:35:06,372 --> 00:35:10,103
If he'd only seen my forecast,
maybe it could have been prevented.

662
00:35:10,335 --> 00:35:13,718
Or maybe it could have been prevented
if somebody hadn't turned on the...

663
00:35:13,882 --> 00:35:17,184
weather dish death machine
while he was soaking in the grotto.

664
00:35:17,304 --> 00:35:19,119
Are you referring to...

665
00:35:19,433 --> 00:35:21,347
Dr. Whiticus's climate dish array?

666
00:35:21,784 --> 00:35:24,367
- You think that's what caused all this?
- Pretty sure.

667
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,146
I warned him.

668
00:35:28,529 --> 00:35:30,688
I warned him, it was reckless
to continue his research.

669
00:35:30,811 --> 00:35:32,569
Honestly,
that thing should be destroyed.

670
00:35:32,689 --> 00:35:34,843
That'd be a relief to you, uh?

671
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:38,427
Why would I...

672
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:40,273
Well, if Whiticus can control
the weather,

673
00:35:40,393 --> 00:35:42,506
there's not much need
for a weatherman, is there?

674
00:35:43,456 --> 00:35:45,131
- I had nothing...
- You started the storm

675
00:35:45,251 --> 00:35:47,105
so you could be a hero,
and whiticus's research

676
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,667
- could be shut down once and for all.
- You can't prove that.

677
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:52,277
Actually, I can.
We found footprints by the dish.

678
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,241
Odd thing, though... There was no tread.

679
00:35:54,501 --> 00:35:56,852
Now, who would wear dress shoes
to tramp around in the woods

680
00:35:56,975 --> 00:35:58,287
after midnight?

681
00:36:01,176 --> 00:36:02,229
Uh, Pete?

682
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:08,278
Now, why don't you save us the trouble
of matching our prints to your shoes

683
00:36:08,398 --> 00:36:09,670
and help us stop this thing.

684
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,029
No, I never...

685
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,266
I never meant to hurt anyone.

686
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,610
I mean, I didn't even know that
Wendy and Baxter were out there.

687
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,574
I'm not a killer, Sheriff.

688
00:36:32,697 --> 00:36:33,790
I'm just...

689
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:40,096
I'm so tired of no one taking me
seriously as a scientist in this town.

690
00:36:40,793 --> 00:36:44,060
I mean, it works.
My technology is the vanguard.

691
00:36:44,279 --> 00:36:46,793
Well, it won't matter if
the storm wipes out the town.

692
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:49,172
and we only have a few hours to save it.

693
00:36:51,866 --> 00:36:54,231
Yeah... make that one hour.

694
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,008
It's been building since last night.

695
00:37:02,144 --> 00:37:05,752
It is an incredibly dangerous confluence
of meteorological events.

696
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,694
- A perfect storm.
- Thank you.

697
00:37:07,817 --> 00:37:10,687
A spinning cyclone of instability
high up into cryosphere.

698
00:37:10,824 --> 00:37:12,412
- Ice funnel of death.
- Gotcha.

699
00:37:12,532 --> 00:37:14,150
Why don't you say "Ice funnel of death?"

700
00:37:14,301 --> 00:37:16,241
How is this happening
so far from the ocean?

701
00:37:16,364 --> 00:37:17,581
Lake archimedes.

702
00:37:17,717 --> 00:37:20,778
Cos of all the volatility in the area,
it's providing enough cold moisture

703
00:37:20,898 --> 00:37:22,752
for the storm to brew,
and it's happening fast.

704
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:24,170
This is tomorrow.

705
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,638
- There's no way to stop it?
- Well, warm tropical currents

706
00:37:26,761 --> 00:37:28,483
could counteract
an event like this, but...

707
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:31,354
- we're nowhere near an el nino.
- I might have to evacuate the town.

708
00:37:31,474 --> 00:37:34,228
No, there's no time. We might end up
with a bunch more frozen baxters.

709
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:36,155
Look, all we need is warm water, right?

710
00:37:36,278 --> 00:37:38,762
If your dish thingy could freeze
the hot springs,

711
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:40,360
could it heat a lake?

712
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:43,088
Theoreticall, it could.
But it doesn't have the range.

713
00:37:43,225 --> 00:37:45,427
Presumably, it's attached
to a mainframe in the cabinet.

714
00:37:45,547 --> 00:37:47,140
It's attached underneath the house.

715
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,619
It heats the house.
An environmentally conscious design.

716
00:37:49,742 --> 00:37:52,066
That's it. The lake is the
water source for the hot spring?

717
00:37:52,189 --> 00:37:54,102
Linked to the reactor
by an underground aquifer.

718
00:37:54,225 --> 00:37:57,068
So you crank up the juice at G.D.,

719
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,332
and we build some steam.

720
00:38:00,368 --> 00:38:01,940
I'm gonna need a coat.

721
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,874
Hey, how's it looking on your end?

722
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:11,963
We're at 850 degrees celsius.
Are you there yet?

723
00:38:12,222 --> 00:38:14,410
Yeah. but not for long.

724
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:18,221
Inside the main control panel
of the dish array is an override switch.

725
00:38:18,461 --> 00:38:21,694
You need to manually aim
the dish directly at the lake

726
00:38:21,814 --> 00:38:23,553
to get it to flash boil the water.

727
00:38:23,673 --> 00:38:27,071
<i>If it evaporates too slowly,
we only strengthen the hurricane.</i>

728
00:38:27,194 --> 00:38:28,848
So no pressure.

729
00:38:38,335 --> 00:38:39,650
<i>Timing is critical.</i>

730
00:38:39,771 --> 00:38:42,969
You need to activate the dish
when we reach 1,000 degrees celsius

731
00:38:43,092 --> 00:38:44,937
<i>to hit the flash boil point.</i>

732
00:38:50,868 --> 00:38:52,946
I found the override. Where do I aim it?

733
00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:55,911
You need to dial it 60 degrees
to the northeast.

734
00:39:04,137 --> 00:39:06,783
<i>We're at 975 degrees.</i>

735
00:39:07,705 --> 00:39:09,120
Got it!

736
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,099
Almost there. You ready?

737
00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:14,328
Hang on!

738
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,709
We're at 1,000 degrees!

739
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:18,073
- You have to do it now!
- I'm trying!

740
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:23,240
How hard is it to push a button?

741
00:39:23,843 --> 00:39:24,950
You wanna do it?

742
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:26,221
Carter!

743
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,821
He did it. Carter, are you okay?

744
00:39:48,713 --> 00:39:50,709
<i>Carter? Say something.</i>

745
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:52,731
I want a raise.

746
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:03,905
Like they think this is a solution,
bouncing me back and forth.

747
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,308
Well, who would you choose?

748
00:40:06,444 --> 00:40:07,669
I mea, if you had to.

749
00:40:07,789 --> 00:40:09,164
Your mom or your dad?

750
00:40:09,423 --> 00:40:11,345
Well, if they loved me,
they wouldn't make me.

751
00:40:11,465 --> 00:40:12,465
but...

752
00:40:13,414 --> 00:40:16,367
right now i'm just so
mad at my dad for lying to me.

753
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:20,050
Well, you know, sometimes
people have good reasons for lying.

754
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:22,730
There is no good reason for lying.

755
00:40:24,793 --> 00:40:27,295
Surprise!

756
00:40:32,407 --> 00:40:34,430
I hate surprises.

757
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:52,671
Any job offers?

758
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:55,145
Yeah, a few.

759
00:40:55,883 --> 00:40:57,604
I heard 17.

760
00:40:58,506 --> 00:41:00,440
It would be crass to count.

761
00:41:00,939 --> 00:41:04,165
Just so you know,
I traced the email on KB-201.

762
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,237
I know you sent it.

763
00:41:11,451 --> 00:41:13,966
I just wanted what was best for Kevin.

764
00:41:20,401 --> 00:41:21,781
Give me one second.

765
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:27,567
Henry, I've arranged for everything
to be unsealed tomorrow...

766
00:41:27,704 --> 00:41:30,233
Kim's section five records,
all of her data.

767
00:41:30,383 --> 00:41:31,955
Oh, thanks. It...

768
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:35,170
- It means a lot to me.
- Me too.

769
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,656
Thank you.

770
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,346
So has she said anything to you?

771
00:41:38,466 --> 00:41:39,746
Not a word.

772
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,518
- Me neither.
- But it really is a really nice party.

773
00:41:43,641 --> 00:41:45,937
Yeah. I'm glad she's having fun.

774
00:41:47,536 --> 00:41:49,859
Mr. and Mrs. Macarena.

775
00:41:51,663 --> 00:41:53,249
I really hate him.

776
00:41:56,452 --> 00:41:58,079
So what do we do now?

777
00:41:59,418 --> 00:42:01,154
What do you want to do?

778
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:04,987
I don't know.

779
00:42:07,133 --> 00:42:09,593
Well, then Zoe and I
will go back to L.A. and...

780
00:42:10,686 --> 00:42:11,998
and when you do,

781
00:42:12,969 --> 00:42:14,787
you'll know where to find us.
