1
00:00:07,199 --> 00:00:08,309
Thanks, Zo.

2
00:00:08,873 --> 00:00:11,799
Still need a ride
to school tomorrow?

3
00:00:12,122 --> 00:00:14,225
Isn't that what boyfriends are for?

4
00:00:16,436 --> 00:00:17,253
Miss!

5
00:00:17,462 --> 00:00:20,221
Can I get a...
Can I get a warm-up over here...

6
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:22,731
So you don't?

7
00:00:23,574 --> 00:00:25,278
Just being an attentive waitress.

8
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:28,698
- Yeah, just don't be too attentive.
- Helps me get tips.

9
00:00:28,937 --> 00:00:30,742
Not the kind of tips
I want you getting.

10
00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:38,096
What's the matter?
You don't like the food?

11
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:39,611
No. It's... great.

12
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:42,066
I just don't have much
of an appetite.

13
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:45,400
You thinking about Allison
getting married to Stark?

14
00:00:46,573 --> 00:00:47,623
I am now.

15
00:00:48,025 --> 00:00:50,345
No, it's the Henry situation.

16
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:52,972
I've sent him packages,
but security won't let them through.

17
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,369
You know, I can't think
of anything worse

18
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:58,212
than eating prison food
for the rest of your life.

19
00:00:58,332 --> 00:01:01,690
I mean, other than being in prison
for the rest of your life.

20
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,652
Yeah. For me, it just doesn't seem right
without him around.

21
00:01:05,871 --> 00:01:08,451
Feels like the whole town's
out of balance.

22
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:15,648
See what I mean?

23
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:23,189
A hiring freeze is one thing,
but cutting 75 jobs is quite another.

24
00:01:23,309 --> 00:01:25,337
We've got to start saving
somewhere, Doctor.

25
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:26,418
Start?

26
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,252
You will decimate
entire disciplines here at GD.

27
00:01:29,372 --> 00:01:31,636
Leaving everyone wondering
who's gonna be next.

28
00:01:32,205 --> 00:01:35,473
Look, I came here to make GD a lean
and commercially productive machine.

29
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:36,989
It's what I do.

30
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:39,269
Now, there are gonna be
some changes here and in town.

31
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,504
And while I appreciate
the lively discourse,

32
00:01:41,624 --> 00:01:43,897
let's try to remember
that while I'm here, I am the boss.

33
00:01:44,262 --> 00:01:46,359
Which is for how much longer again?

34
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:48,439
Till I'm successful.

35
00:01:48,672 --> 00:01:50,809
And I do hope
you're still here to see me go.

36
00:01:51,127 --> 00:01:53,908
So change means firing people,
just so I have that straight.

37
00:01:54,264 --> 00:01:56,494
Not necessarily.
Take a look at this.

38
00:01:59,894 --> 00:02:01,416
Look what Santa brought me.

39
00:02:02,309 --> 00:02:03,309
What is this?

40
00:02:03,856 --> 00:02:07,297
This is the new Global Dynamics
consumer research products lab.

41
00:02:07,534 --> 00:02:10,175
And this is its new director.

42
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:11,676
Zane?

43
00:02:12,594 --> 00:02:15,555
He's a risk taker
with cross-discipline experience.

44
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:17,846
Yeah, the words
"Zane" and "discipline"

45
00:02:17,966 --> 00:02:20,042
tend not to go together
in the same sentence.

46
00:02:20,162 --> 00:02:21,999
This place is gonna be awesome.

47
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:25,148
Miss Thorne's giving me a blank check
to hire anyone I want.

48
00:02:25,637 --> 00:02:27,150
Buy any equipment that I need.

49
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:29,903
If we're cutting costs,
how can we afford the startup on this?

50
00:02:30,313 --> 00:02:32,243
Corporate synergy, of course.

51
00:02:36,592 --> 00:02:38,369
If we come up
with a hot product in here,

52
00:02:38,735 --> 00:02:41,121
maybe Miss Thorne won't have
to make so many cutbacks.

53
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,749
Research meets commerce.

54
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:44,900
Perfect balance.

55
00:02:57,694 --> 00:02:59,022
Is this your card?

56
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:01,328
No.

57
00:03:04,029 --> 00:03:04,813
Damn.

58
00:03:05,493 --> 00:03:06,342
This?

59
00:03:08,338 --> 00:03:09,203
No.

60
00:03:14,476 --> 00:03:15,310
So...

61
00:03:17,118 --> 00:03:19,794
I heard they're moving you
to a different facility.

62
00:03:19,914 --> 00:03:23,706
Next week.
A federal supermax in Colorado.

63
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:26,917
I guess these walls
aren't thick enough to hold

64
00:03:27,078 --> 00:03:28,878
a dangerous criminal like me.

65
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,970
Tell you everyone says hi?

66
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,676
- Vince. Zoe.
- Yeah. Yeah, you did.

67
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:37,095
Yeah, I appreciate it.
Thanks.

68
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:41,621
You okay?

69
00:03:43,085 --> 00:03:43,934
Yeah.

70
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:46,938
You know what...

71
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,823
why don't you tell me about...

72
00:03:51,558 --> 00:03:52,610
the weather.

73
00:03:53,869 --> 00:03:56,364
Honestly,
I am desperate for a sunset.

74
00:03:59,308 --> 00:04:00,155
Okay.

75
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:09,544
911. Allison.

76
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:12,348
Right.

77
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,780
Okay.

78
00:04:27,283 --> 00:04:29,031
I'll see about that sunset.

79
00:04:32,435 --> 00:04:33,447
Hey.

80
00:04:34,745 --> 00:04:35,594
Hi.

81
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:41,190
- So where's the big emergency?
- Lab 27.

82
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,655
I'll show you.

83
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,072
So how you been?

84
00:04:46,404 --> 00:04:47,990
Oh, great. Grea... Yeah.

85
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:50,104
You?

86
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:52,370
- Great. Really great.
- Good.

87
00:04:57,776 --> 00:05:00,499
Is the... the wedding planning
keeping you busy?

88
00:05:00,619 --> 00:05:02,352
Do you really want to know?

89
00:05:04,616 --> 00:05:06,310
The... So the...
The 911 is...

90
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,306
Missing person,
he's been gone two days,

91
00:05:08,426 --> 00:05:12,097
a scientist in Lab 27
named Bob Nobb.

92
00:05:15,206 --> 00:05:16,935
Is it...
It's really Bob Nobb?

93
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:19,679
- He's... Did you check in his house?
- He lives in the lab.

94
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:21,433
You check under his cot?

95
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,146
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

96
00:05:25,648 --> 00:05:26,804
It never is.

97
00:05:29,135 --> 00:05:31,745
So Lab 27's been in operation
for 11 years.

98
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,278
I've been director for two.

99
00:05:33,398 --> 00:05:35,963
And how long's Bob Nobb
been involved?

100
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:38,560
Since the beginning, of course.

101
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:42,490
He have any favorite hangouts?
Places he liked to go?

102
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,340
- You didn't explain?
- I was getting to that.

103
00:05:46,134 --> 00:05:48,782
Okay. Lab 27 is a sealed biosphere.

104
00:05:48,902 --> 00:05:51,153
A self-sustaing ecosystem
designed to research

105
00:05:51,273 --> 00:05:52,812
and support the Mars missions.

106
00:05:52,932 --> 00:05:55,233
You do mean
the potential Mars missions.

107
00:05:55,804 --> 00:05:56,744
Right.

108
00:05:58,224 --> 00:05:59,224
I mean, right.

109
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,158
- How long has Bob been in there for?
- 11 years.

110
00:06:04,816 --> 00:06:06,077
- 11 years?
- Yeah.

111
00:06:06,386 --> 00:06:08,621
Well, along with nine
other researchers.

112
00:06:09,337 --> 00:06:11,484
What kind of people do that?

113
00:06:12,429 --> 00:06:15,620
I think a life dedicated to science
and sacrifice is quite noble.

114
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,588
I actually applied
to join the team myself.

115
00:06:17,851 --> 00:06:19,382
Well, congratulations.

116
00:06:20,384 --> 00:06:22,427
Well, I wasn't chosen, so...

117
00:06:22,678 --> 00:06:24,595
- That's why I'm congratulating you.
- Carter.

118
00:06:24,756 --> 00:06:27,408
Yes, so, ten people in there
for 11 years and no one's come

119
00:06:27,528 --> 00:06:29,517
- in and out in all that time?
- No. No one.

120
00:06:30,742 --> 00:06:32,826
It's gonna be a walk in the park.

121
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,719
Well, see for yourself.

122
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:49,746
That's a big park.

123
00:07:04,317 --> 00:07:07,345
Season 3 Episode 02
What About Bob? (v 1.00)

124
00:07:08,299 --> 00:07:10,540
Teams Projet-SG & 6th-Race.

125
00:07:10,837 --> 00:07:14,061
http://projet-sg.net
http://u-sub.net

126
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,203
So Lab 27 is a 12,000 acre,
closed ecological system

127
00:07:18,323 --> 00:07:20,109
located a 1/2 mile below us.

128
00:07:20,411 --> 00:07:22,774
Inside is a 850-square meter lake,

129
00:07:22,894 --> 00:07:24,388
a savannah grassland,

130
00:07:24,508 --> 00:07:27,065
a rainforest
where the human habitat is located.

131
00:07:27,185 --> 00:07:29,254
Okay, why build it underground?

132
00:07:29,696 --> 00:07:30,731
Control.

133
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:33,569
Weather. Day/night simulation.
Communications.

134
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:35,737
Everything's generated and monitored
from right here.

135
00:07:35,857 --> 00:07:39,279
And this billion dollar fishbowl
produces what exactly?

136
00:07:40,523 --> 00:07:43,263
Priceless information
about creating a balanced environment.

137
00:07:43,383 --> 00:07:45,418
You and I have
a very different definition

138
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:48,753
of priceless and balanced.

139
00:07:48,923 --> 00:07:50,940
I don't think now is the time
to discuss budget.

140
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,518
No. Why don't you guys duke it out
while I go take a look inside.

141
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:57,784
You can't go inside. Entering the lab
is a total violation of protocol.

142
00:07:57,904 --> 00:07:59,848
But I have to find out
if someone knows anything

143
00:07:59,968 --> 00:08:02,949
about the disappearance of Bob Nobb.
I can't do that without talking to 'em.

144
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:05,738
No, we... We have cameras, monitors.
You can interview anyone you want

145
00:08:05,898 --> 00:08:07,625
- from right here.
- It's not the same.

146
00:08:07,745 --> 00:08:10,371
- It'd be better if it was face to face.
- I agree with you, Sheriff.

147
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:13,454
I think you should enter the lab,
and you should take Dr. Blake with you.

148
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,724
What? Why?

149
00:08:14,844 --> 00:08:17,062
Because while you're doing your job,
you can help justify

150
00:08:17,182 --> 00:08:19,794
why we're not filling in
this giant money pit.

151
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:28,136
- Hi.
- Look up.

152
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,763
Why'd you do that?

153
00:08:32,138 --> 00:08:33,481
So I can do this.

154
00:08:36,435 --> 00:08:38,443
And this.

155
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:41,185
And this.

156
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:45,361
Holographic tomography.

157
00:08:46,561 --> 00:08:49,574
It's generated by the nanoprobes
I just injected into your system.

158
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:51,948
It's from my lab.

159
00:08:55,997 --> 00:08:57,246
I have no pants.

160
00:08:59,591 --> 00:09:01,429
Funny you should mention that.

161
00:09:02,436 --> 00:09:04,160
<i>So the chamber
uses high intensity light</i>

162
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,138
<i>to remove any trace of bacteria
from your skin</i>

163
00:09:06,258 --> 00:09:08,204
<i>so you don't contaminate the lab.</i>

164
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:11,352
Is there any reason
we had to do this together?

165
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:13,723
Not really. No.

166
00:09:18,814 --> 00:09:22,315
Not the way I ever pictured us
winding up naked.

167
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,736
- You pictured us winding up naked?
- No.

168
00:09:28,939 --> 00:09:29,997
Son of a...

169
00:09:30,117 --> 00:09:33,200
Forgot to warn you about the flash.
I've never done this before.

170
00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:35,435
- I can't see.
- Me either.

171
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:38,964
<i>- Clean suits are on your left.</i>
- Right. Wait. Hers or mine?

172
00:09:39,084 --> 00:09:40,898
Come on, Carter.
Get it.

173
00:09:41,751 --> 00:09:44,540
- No, no. I'm pretty sure that's mine.
- Right. Right.

174
00:09:46,272 --> 00:09:48,471
- Can you...
- Yeah. Okay, I got 'em.

175
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:12,680
Welcome to Lab 27.

176
00:10:14,591 --> 00:10:16,583
Unbelievable.

177
00:10:20,782 --> 00:10:22,653
Cutting GD's research is one thing.

178
00:10:22,773 --> 00:10:25,981
Putting our greatest human assets
at risk is quite another.

179
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:29,632
I had no idea you cared that much
about Sheriff Carter.

180
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:33,091
I'll run point on this.
I know the lab. I know the protocols.

181
00:10:34,317 --> 00:10:36,939
I'm sure you have better things to do
than stare at the monitors.

182
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:39,141
You have no idea, Dr. Stark.

183
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,411
Hourly reports.

184
00:10:41,531 --> 00:10:43,314
I have some business in town.

185
00:10:48,221 --> 00:10:49,833
All this is inside?

186
00:10:49,953 --> 00:10:52,187
Take a deep breath.
What do you smell?

187
00:10:52,405 --> 00:10:53,266
Trees?

188
00:10:54,672 --> 00:10:56,874
A lake?
Maybe some fertilizer.

189
00:10:56,994 --> 00:10:59,287
It's amazing, right,
how real it seems?

190
00:11:00,054 --> 00:11:02,811
- Is it real?
- Well, the animals and plants are.

191
00:11:02,931 --> 00:11:04,626
But the clouds and the breeze,

192
00:11:04,746 --> 00:11:06,435
the way day turns to night,

193
00:11:06,686 --> 00:11:09,813
all of it's created in the control room
to maintain a balance in the system

194
00:11:09,933 --> 00:11:12,959
and make the lab seem
more real for the residence.

195
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:17,621
- How do they make it rain?
- Recycled urine.

196
00:11:19,243 --> 00:11:20,481
That's lovely.

197
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:22,439
It's amazing, actually.

198
00:11:22,686 --> 00:11:24,061
Everything here is.

199
00:11:25,681 --> 00:11:27,894
I'm Teri.
This is my home.

200
00:11:28,746 --> 00:11:30,359
I've come to take you to the others.

201
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,309
Just like old times, huh?

202
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:41,746
You know it.
You, me, a six-pack of Zima.

203
00:11:43,632 --> 00:11:45,458
Fargo, what are you doing?

204
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:48,564
Hijacking the internal network
of Lab 27.

205
00:11:48,684 --> 00:11:49,795
Bootleggin' the feed.

206
00:11:49,915 --> 00:11:52,004
That doesn't sound like
something you should be doing.

207
00:11:52,124 --> 00:11:54,855
It's totally "not" something
I should be doing. But it's Lab 27,

208
00:11:54,975 --> 00:11:56,376
mother of all reality shows.

209
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:59,180
I hacked into it when I was an intern.
It was like my barney.

210
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:01,557
And what's your excuse?

211
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,513
Fargo and I are viewing buddies.
That's how we bonded.

212
00:12:05,101 --> 00:12:08,902
Okay.
So what's so special about today?

213
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:10,691
New characters.

214
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,611
Hey, that's my dad!

215
00:12:13,973 --> 00:12:15,497
Everybody's pretty freaked out.

216
00:12:15,617 --> 00:12:17,931
Derek said this was all
about Bob's disappearance.

217
00:12:18,051 --> 00:12:21,327
But some people are wondering
if you coming inside means the end.

218
00:12:21,582 --> 00:12:23,924
- Would that be a bad thing?
- Not if everyone wanted to leave,

219
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:25,429
which they don't.

220
00:12:25,927 --> 00:12:27,008
Come here.

221
00:12:30,307 --> 00:12:33,374
I'm not sure, but I think
some of these plant strains are extinct.

222
00:12:33,494 --> 00:12:35,883
That's Bob's garden.
He was really proud of it.

223
00:12:36,432 --> 00:12:37,814
So he had a green thumb.

224
00:12:38,295 --> 00:12:39,870
What else can you tell us about him?

225
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,979
No one liked him very much.

226
00:12:49,995 --> 00:12:53,002
Rick and Laura Wallace.
We're team codirectors. Teri's parents.

227
00:12:53,122 --> 00:12:54,777
Allison Blake.
This is Jack Carter.

228
00:12:54,938 --> 00:12:56,778
- Yeah, we know who you are, Dr. Blake.
- Hi.

229
00:12:56,939 --> 00:12:59,188
- Abe Jensen, integrated systems.
- Hi.

230
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:01,177
We're here about your friend, Bob.

231
00:13:01,297 --> 00:13:03,459
Just because we live together
doesn't mean we're friends.

232
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:04,535
Abe, please.

233
00:13:04,655 --> 00:13:06,705
Well, I take it you've had
some problems with Bob.

234
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,583
Just seems he's always sticking it
where it doesn't belong.

235
00:13:10,435 --> 00:13:12,211
Go ahead. Ask if anyone misses him.

236
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,213
Okay.
Does anyone Miss Bob?

237
00:13:21,477 --> 00:13:23,070
Not really.

238
00:13:24,747 --> 00:13:26,725
Any idea
what might've happened to him?

239
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,895
Are there any hazards around here
I should know about?

240
00:13:31,056 --> 00:13:34,268
Abandoned wells, wood chippers,
dangerous animals.

241
00:13:34,388 --> 00:13:36,500
No. No. No. No predators.

242
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,506
We have a hard enough time as it is
maintaining the balance down here

243
00:13:39,626 --> 00:13:42,023
without one lab animal
eating the others.

244
00:13:43,814 --> 00:13:44,618
Teri?

245
00:13:57,248 --> 00:13:58,403
Over here!

246
00:14:00,983 --> 00:14:02,178
Over here!

247
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,978
I think she just fainted.

248
00:14:06,098 --> 00:14:08,726
- Are you okay? What happened?
- I'm okay. It went that way.

249
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:09,960
It?

250
00:14:25,036 --> 00:14:27,153
- What is it?
- It's Bob's uniform.

251
00:14:39,053 --> 00:14:40,591
What the hell was that?

252
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,869
I don't know.
But it went into that hole.

253
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,635
No predators, huh?

254
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:09,030
Hey, guys.

255
00:15:10,126 --> 00:15:11,544
What are we watching?

256
00:15:13,214 --> 00:15:14,189
My dad.

257
00:15:14,576 --> 00:15:16,252
<i>We need to talk, Nathan.</i>

258
00:15:16,619 --> 00:15:18,928
He's gonna be okay in there, right?

259
00:15:24,336 --> 00:15:25,844
<i>Alli, I want you out of there.</i>

260
00:15:26,004 --> 00:15:27,596
I'm fine, Nathan.
Don't worry.

261
00:15:28,234 --> 00:15:29,431
<i>Teri, are you okay?</i>

262
00:15:29,873 --> 00:15:33,102
I'm okay, Derek. Really.
I don't even know what I saw exactly.

263
00:15:33,773 --> 00:15:36,146
<i>All right, tell me about the hole
this thing climbed into.</i>

264
00:15:36,804 --> 00:15:37,840
It was...

265
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:41,042
a slippery hole.

266
00:15:41,431 --> 00:15:42,160
And

267
00:15:43,203 --> 00:15:44,321
this was inside it.

268
00:15:45,354 --> 00:15:47,616
It's Bob's,
and whatever left it got away.

269
00:15:48,063 --> 00:15:48,938
<i>That's it.</i>

270
00:15:49,058 --> 00:15:52,162
<i>I'm initiating evacuation
and shutdown scenario right now.</i>

271
00:15:52,564 --> 00:15:55,665
- Great. Where do we go?
<i>- Unfortunately, it's not that easy.</i>

272
00:15:55,826 --> 00:15:58,455
<i>After ten years, the residents
immune systems have changed.</i>

273
00:15:58,575 --> 00:16:01,623
<i>We can sterilize you to go in,
but we can't sterilize the world</i>

274
00:16:01,743 --> 00:16:03,199
<i>for them coming out.</i>

275
00:16:03,584 --> 00:16:06,009
<i>It's gonna take a transition facility.
And that's gonna take time.</i>

276
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:09,263
All right, in the meantime,
can you tell us what this stuff is?

277
00:16:09,423 --> 00:16:12,065
<i>We're uplinking the chemical
components right now,</i>

278
00:16:12,185 --> 00:16:14,643
<i>but it's gonna take
some time for the results.</i>

279
00:16:17,905 --> 00:16:19,907
We'll try to get some of our own.

280
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,836
My, how homey.

281
00:16:29,418 --> 00:16:32,161
Miss Thorne.
What brings you here?

282
00:16:32,605 --> 00:16:34,747
This. I need your help on something.

283
00:16:35,146 --> 00:16:37,845
Institutional changes here in town
that will put Eureka

284
00:16:37,965 --> 00:16:40,135
on a secure financial footing.

285
00:16:40,303 --> 00:16:42,084
Shouldn't this wait
for Sheriff Carter?

286
00:16:42,204 --> 00:16:43,825
Sheriff Carter's got his hands full.

287
00:16:43,945 --> 00:16:46,591
Based on your record,
I know that you're up to the challenge.

288
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,386
- Well, thanks, but...
- Credit where credit's due.

289
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:55,976
No more free food at Café Diem.

290
00:16:57,917 --> 00:17:00,481
- Parking meter installation?
- I'm afraid the free ride is over.

291
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:02,732
Fees for library cards?

292
00:17:02,894 --> 00:17:04,890
Just the cards.
The books are still free.

293
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,384
Closing the museum.

294
00:17:07,878 --> 00:17:09,739
I didn't even know
Eureka had a museum.

295
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:11,450
My point exactly.

296
00:17:14,194 --> 00:17:15,008
Okay.

297
00:17:15,755 --> 00:17:17,440
Snake catching gear, huh?

298
00:17:17,991 --> 00:17:21,196
Well, we're a pretty resourceful bunch,
but that's a test.

299
00:17:21,882 --> 00:17:24,650
- You guys even have snakes down here?
- Over 20 varieties,

300
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:27,174
but nothing more dangerous
than your common garter snake.

301
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:31,011
And no animal experiments
that maybe got out of control?

302
00:17:31,697 --> 00:17:34,640
Sheriff, we're not the island
of Dr. Moreau.

303
00:17:34,892 --> 00:17:36,248
Well, you're not an island.

304
00:17:36,368 --> 00:17:38,600
I don't know what they told you
about our team,

305
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,269
but we're not a bunch of amateurs.

306
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,203
I mean, we take our research
very seriously

307
00:17:42,323 --> 00:17:44,256
and it's a project
that we really believe in.

308
00:17:44,376 --> 00:17:45,901
This... This is our moon shot.

309
00:17:46,061 --> 00:17:48,077
Even Teri's enthusiastic
about the mission,

310
00:17:48,197 --> 00:17:50,233
and she's been down here
since she was a kid.

311
00:17:50,353 --> 00:17:51,490
And what about Bob?

312
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,665
You guys don't seem
too enthusiastic about him.

313
00:17:53,785 --> 00:17:55,201
You sense that.

314
00:17:55,321 --> 00:17:56,120
Yeah.

315
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:59,286
Well, that's his desk
right over there.

316
00:18:01,302 --> 00:18:04,869
- What's his specialty?
- Sustainable agriculture.

317
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,991
And apparently women.

318
00:18:14,353 --> 00:18:15,389
That's your wife.

319
00:18:16,701 --> 00:18:19,040
Guy made a run
at everything in a skirt.

320
00:18:19,678 --> 00:18:23,183
In the last couple of months, he seemed
to take a shine to my daughter Teri.

321
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:26,363
- Did that come up? You talk about that?
- You bet I did.

322
00:18:27,013 --> 00:18:29,945
He denied it, of course.
But I caught her a couple of times

323
00:18:30,105 --> 00:18:32,114
coming back from his garden
all dreamy-eyed.

324
00:18:32,274 --> 00:18:34,313
Said she'd been "watching clouds".

325
00:18:35,374 --> 00:18:38,653
Just the thought of him trying something
with her makes me...

326
00:18:41,827 --> 00:18:42,850
Yeah, well.

327
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:45,720
Monofilament netting.

328
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,913
Very high tensile strength.

329
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:54,950
- This should be good.
- So no dangerous animals.

330
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:58,181
No crazy experiments.
That leaves people.

331
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:01,968
Could someone have engineered
a predator

332
00:19:02,088 --> 00:19:04,133
and sicced it on him?
Maybe somebody with a grudge?

333
00:19:04,253 --> 00:19:07,148
Sheriff, if I think of anything,
I'll let you know.

334
00:19:29,505 --> 00:19:30,505
<i>I miss you.</i>

335
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:33,634
<i>- How you doin'?</i>
- I'm safe, I promise.

336
00:19:34,245 --> 00:19:35,429
I miss you too.

337
00:19:36,414 --> 00:19:38,013
<i>How's Carter doin'?</i>

338
00:19:38,499 --> 00:19:40,575
No, actually, Carter's doing fine.

339
00:19:41,785 --> 00:19:44,102
Of course,
I would tell you if he wa...

340
00:19:46,998 --> 00:19:47,819
Carter.

341
00:19:47,939 --> 00:19:50,825
So you're not just here to take a look
at the lab, but to keep an eye on me.

342
00:19:50,945 --> 00:19:51,658
No.

343
00:19:52,565 --> 00:19:53,338
Yes.

344
00:19:54,247 --> 00:19:56,138
- Assuming this is Stark's idea.
- Not at all.

345
00:19:56,258 --> 00:19:59,260
- No.
- Okay, Carter, it was my idea, okay?

346
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,487
When Thorne brought out
the chart with all the red dots

347
00:20:01,607 --> 00:20:03,642
showing how exciting
things had gotten in town

348
00:20:03,762 --> 00:20:06,115
since you showed up,
she was concerned.

349
00:20:06,684 --> 00:20:09,871
- And so were you.
- Not about you. For you.

350
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:13,465
- I'm trying to protect you, Carter.
- What are you gonna protect me from?

351
00:20:13,778 --> 00:20:15,425
The prehistoric plants?

352
00:20:15,706 --> 00:20:17,719
- A giant, man-eating snake?
- From Thorne.

353
00:20:19,793 --> 00:20:22,658
Not sure she's the one
I'm worried about right now.

354
00:20:26,611 --> 00:20:28,157
My goodness.
What did I miss?

355
00:20:28,277 --> 00:20:30,908
My dad hunting for the creature
from the black lagoon.

356
00:20:31,028 --> 00:20:34,451
Admit, the injection of new talent
has really made this show fresh again.

357
00:20:34,571 --> 00:20:37,141
So which one of the scientists
is the red herring?

358
00:20:37,261 --> 00:20:39,020
Do you think the arrival
of Sheriff Carter

359
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,925
has made it more procedural?

360
00:20:41,249 --> 00:20:43,685
No, no, no.
That was the switch up.

361
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:50,540
Grace. Other than, obviously, Teri,

362
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,189
you're the only other single woman
down here, right?

363
00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:54,751
Actually, yeah.

364
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:56,937
Nice of you to notice.

365
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:00,330
Well, and did Bob Nobb notice?

366
00:21:00,699 --> 00:21:02,025
Well, of course.

367
00:21:03,201 --> 00:21:05,292
He and I were a bit of an item.

368
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:10,851
Is that before or after Laura?
Or the... The girl with the curly hair?

369
00:21:10,971 --> 00:21:14,082
- You saw his pictures.
- Yes. Those were hard to miss.

370
00:21:15,044 --> 00:21:17,546
I was with Bob
as long as anybody else.

371
00:21:18,571 --> 00:21:21,495
Three or four times, actually,
over the years.

372
00:21:21,837 --> 00:21:23,568
Until it was time...

373
00:21:23,688 --> 00:21:25,747
to "rotate the crops", which...

374
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,975
That's what he called it.

375
00:21:28,313 --> 00:21:29,387
Nice.

376
00:21:29,507 --> 00:21:30,514
Yeah.

377
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:35,147
Always with the stupid
agricultural euphemisms.

378
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,195
Pretty stupid.

379
00:21:38,234 --> 00:21:41,281
I can't tell you the number of days
I just wanted to just...

380
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:44,504
- plough him under, you know?
- And what's your specialty?

381
00:21:44,914 --> 00:21:46,008
Genetics.

382
00:21:47,388 --> 00:21:49,630
I really need to get back to work.

383
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:51,229
Yeah.

384
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,386
<i>Carter, I just came in to call you.
How'd you know?</i>

385
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,679
I didn't.
I just hit redial.

386
00:22:25,112 --> 00:22:27,617
<i>Well, we got the results back
on the substance on Bob's shoe.</i>

387
00:22:27,737 --> 00:22:30,017
<i>We had to run 'em twice
'cause we couldn't believe it.</i>

388
00:22:30,178 --> 00:22:32,596
- So what's the verdict?
- <i>Human.</i>

389
00:22:33,647 --> 00:22:36,148
- <i>Kind of.</i>
- Human kind of?

390
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:41,086
Oh, I'm gonna regret this.

391
00:22:42,614 --> 00:22:44,199
<i>Carter, what is it?</i>

392
00:22:49,303 --> 00:22:50,413
I can't watch.

393
00:23:13,242 --> 00:23:14,595
Help me.

394
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,486
You're not ordering a lockdown.

395
00:23:22,647 --> 00:23:24,409
Did you see
what they caught in there?

396
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:26,665
The woman I'm going to marry
is in there.

397
00:23:26,785 --> 00:23:29,550
For all you know, there could be
a contagious mutation as well.

398
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,992
You're not a scientist,
you don't know what you're saying.

399
00:23:32,112 --> 00:23:35,220
What I do know is Dr. Blake
and Sheriff Carter staying in there

400
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,816
is both the safest course of action
and the best way for us

401
00:23:37,936 --> 00:23:41,130
to find out what the hell is going on.
And you know it too.

402
00:23:41,903 --> 00:23:43,037
I'm sorry.

403
00:23:44,746 --> 00:23:46,331
Why is it raining?

404
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:48,319
I started it per schedule.

405
00:23:48,439 --> 00:23:49,822
Let's shut it off.

406
00:23:50,464 --> 00:23:52,938
No need to make the man
more miserable.

407
00:23:59,818 --> 00:24:01,872
I could barely get the needle
through his skin.

408
00:24:01,992 --> 00:24:03,301
What's happening to him?

409
00:24:03,579 --> 00:24:06,199
Loss of sebaceous glands.
High keratin levels.

410
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,326
There's a condition
called Ichthyosis Vulgaris.

411
00:24:09,486 --> 00:24:11,228
Fish scale disease.

412
00:24:11,668 --> 00:24:13,288
I guess it could look like this, but...

413
00:24:13,478 --> 00:24:16,925
<i>No disease would do this to his DNA.
Not to the extent we're seeing.</i>

414
00:24:17,045 --> 00:24:18,794
- All right. Then what would?
- <i>Atavism.</i>

415
00:24:20,066 --> 00:24:21,665
Evolution in reverse.

416
00:24:21,843 --> 00:24:22,895
Explain.

417
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:26,329
90% of our DNA
is believed to be dormant,

418
00:24:26,449 --> 00:24:29,185
left over from when
we all shared common ancestors.

419
00:24:29,305 --> 00:24:32,844
Atavism is the reappearance of traces
that have disappeared.

420
00:24:32,964 --> 00:24:35,894
<i>Hind legs on whales.
Vestigial tails on babies.</i>

421
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:38,313
Or snake parts on Bob Nobb?

422
00:24:38,697 --> 00:24:39,563
<i>Apparently.</i>

423
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:43,722
<i>We all carry genes that are identical
to those in fish, birds, reptiles,</i>

424
00:24:44,351 --> 00:24:47,697
- <i>but that DNA's believed to be dormant.</i>
- Until now.

425
00:24:47,857 --> 00:24:50,439
All right. Assuming we go with that.
How would it happen?

426
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,147
<i>Closed environment down there.</i>

427
00:24:52,267 --> 00:24:56,206
<i>The ecosystem must've gotten knocked out
and just continued to self-reinforce.</i>

428
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,500
Okay. Is there a specialist up there
we can talk to?

429
00:24:59,696 --> 00:25:02,390
<i>Yeah. I know just the guy.
Worked on the shuttle team.</i>

430
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,326
<i>Developed their life support system.</i>

431
00:25:04,446 --> 00:25:06,399
<i>And genetics
is one of his sub-specialties.</i>

432
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:09,094
<i>I've told you nobody else
is entering the lab.</i>

433
00:25:09,254 --> 00:25:12,195
Well, it doesn't matter.
That person is Henry.

434
00:25:12,699 --> 00:25:14,081
We're on our own.

435
00:25:15,009 --> 00:25:16,323
Not necessarily.

436
00:25:24,602 --> 00:25:26,361
I'm not forgetting what you did at GD.

437
00:25:26,638 --> 00:25:28,582
That's a conversation for another day.

438
00:25:28,702 --> 00:25:31,283
I'm gonna set that aside right now
because Global needs your help.

439
00:25:31,996 --> 00:25:33,660
I don't see how I can provide that.

440
00:25:33,937 --> 00:25:36,830
As much as I hate to admit it,
Sheriff Carter had an idea.

441
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:55,724
Look, I just wanted to apologize
for earlier.

442
00:25:56,076 --> 00:25:57,267
- Forget it.
- Look,

443
00:25:57,427 --> 00:26:00,841
with everything goin' on at Global
and Thorne showin' up,

444
00:26:01,466 --> 00:26:03,350
some days I don't know
if I'm comin' or goin'.

445
00:26:03,766 --> 00:26:04,899
Literally.

446
00:26:06,758 --> 00:26:07,907
No worries.

447
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:09,946
I can relate.

448
00:26:10,311 --> 00:26:13,575
And I know you don't need me
to protect you from prehistoric plants.

449
00:26:13,735 --> 00:26:14,746
No.

450
00:26:15,138 --> 00:26:17,797
But if you could teach me
about self-contained biosystems,

451
00:26:17,917 --> 00:26:19,368
that would be great.

452
00:26:19,488 --> 00:26:21,949
Well, maybe I could help you
with that.

453
00:26:22,744 --> 00:26:25,045
Oh, now that's what I call
a switch up!

454
00:26:25,433 --> 00:26:27,265
Henry, how are...

455
00:26:32,638 --> 00:26:33,678
Hologram.

456
00:26:33,887 --> 00:26:36,278
I thought of the one
that Zane made of me

457
00:26:36,969 --> 00:26:39,695
and I'm just glad you have pants.

458
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:41,940
Next screen.

459
00:26:42,323 --> 00:26:44,142
Will this tell us
what's changing Bob?

460
00:26:44,262 --> 00:26:46,794
Maybe, if it's part of the ecosystem,
which I find doubtful.

461
00:26:46,914 --> 00:26:49,448
- Is that diagnostic run complete?
- Bringing it up.

462
00:26:49,568 --> 00:26:51,571
- Why that?
- If the system was contaminated enough

463
00:26:51,731 --> 00:26:54,658
to do what it did to Bob,
people would've gotten sick years ago.

464
00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:57,034
What if the contaminate
wasn't in the system years ago?

465
00:26:57,195 --> 00:26:58,578
Carter, it's a closed system.

466
00:26:58,855 --> 00:27:00,789
People keep saying that,
but we're here.

467
00:27:01,658 --> 00:27:03,178
- That's not right.
- What?

468
00:27:03,298 --> 00:27:05,626
The water.
The ionization levels are way off.

469
00:27:06,265 --> 00:27:09,019
- Ion... Io... C... Could that...
- Alter DNA? Absolutely.

470
00:27:09,139 --> 00:27:11,007
Ionization of the water
produces free radicals

471
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:13,009
which can target
accelerated mutations.

472
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,429
So Bob's being changed
into a snake by the water?

473
00:27:16,826 --> 00:27:19,546
It may not be isolated to just Bob.

474
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:23,520
Well, no. With recycling...
It's... It's the rain?

475
00:27:23,837 --> 00:27:25,326
Can we reverse it?

476
00:27:25,655 --> 00:27:27,651
We can purge the system,
but we can't reverse

477
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,326
the changes
that are already underway.

478
00:27:30,728 --> 00:27:32,065
Sheriff Carter?

479
00:27:34,491 --> 00:27:36,074
Could you look under my shirt?

480
00:27:40,587 --> 00:27:41,940
Please.

481
00:27:48,431 --> 00:27:50,673
It's happening to the others too.

482
00:27:51,794 --> 00:27:53,228
So the two of us?

483
00:27:53,775 --> 00:27:56,085
I'd say it's just a matter of time.

484
00:28:02,243 --> 00:28:04,115
<i>It was the water, all right.</i>

485
00:28:04,235 --> 00:28:05,729
<i>Something or someone changed it.</i>

486
00:28:06,124 --> 00:28:09,023
<i>What you guys are witnessing
is the first ever demonstrated case</i>

487
00:28:09,184 --> 00:28:11,127
<i>of macro de-evolution.</i>

488
00:28:11,561 --> 00:28:13,694
Can you see the variation
in the mutations?

489
00:28:13,914 --> 00:28:16,780
<i>Yes, and whatever it is,
it's affecting the entire genome.</i>

490
00:28:16,941 --> 00:28:18,810
How long does it take
to affect the genome?

491
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,298
I jury-rigged a timeline and up until
a week ago, the water was clean.

492
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:25,749
Looking at the physical progressions,
I would say that's an outside limit.

493
00:28:26,185 --> 00:28:28,377
Look, Zane and I are gonna get
back into the genetics.

494
00:28:28,497 --> 00:28:30,286
You guys just hang tight.

495
00:28:30,928 --> 00:28:32,087
We'll fix this.

496
00:28:32,248 --> 00:28:34,423
Look... I understand...

497
00:28:36,873 --> 00:28:38,953
Really only a little
of what you guys are saying,

498
00:28:39,073 --> 00:28:41,536
but wouldn't it be easier to reverse
if we knew what caused it?

499
00:28:41,656 --> 00:28:43,266
Sure. But how?

500
00:28:44,381 --> 00:28:47,692
I'm still not sure that backing up
on the sedatives is a good idea.

501
00:28:47,812 --> 00:28:49,898
We have no idea how strong he is.

502
00:28:50,058 --> 00:28:51,524
We need to talk to him.

503
00:28:52,156 --> 00:28:53,835
If he's still in there.

504
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:57,623
Hey there, pretty lady.

505
00:28:59,249 --> 00:29:00,657
And apparently, he is.

506
00:29:03,636 --> 00:29:04,537
What happened?

507
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:07,373
The water system in the lab
is mutating people's DNA.

508
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:10,119
We need to know who did this to you
so that we can stop it.

509
00:29:10,296 --> 00:29:12,253
Bob, why would you
have been a target?

510
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,559
Everybody likes me.

511
00:29:14,777 --> 00:29:17,384
Look, why would the water
affect you before everyone else?

512
00:29:17,999 --> 00:29:20,095
I was just watering my garden.

513
00:29:22,485 --> 00:29:24,918
- Oh, my God.
- The de-evolution is accelerating.

514
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:27,542
I'm not sure how much longer
the human side is gonna remain dominant.

515
00:29:27,662 --> 00:29:29,396
And when it isn't?

516
00:29:29,556 --> 00:29:30,642
That.

517
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:34,609
Okay, what are we gonna do now?

518
00:29:36,017 --> 00:29:37,445
We go back to where it started.

519
00:29:47,113 --> 00:29:49,197
Things were just starting to die
this morning.

520
00:29:49,317 --> 00:29:52,280
Yeah, it's like the whole garden's
been torched.

521
00:29:52,563 --> 00:29:54,712
The water that affected Bob,
can it affect plants?

522
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,382
- Sure.
- That's how it affected everyone else.

523
00:29:57,542 --> 00:29:59,384
It went from Bob
to the plants to the others.

524
00:29:59,641 --> 00:30:02,345
That still doesn't tell us how it got
to the water in the first place.

525
00:30:02,621 --> 00:30:05,223
Yeah, but this dead area,

526
00:30:06,516 --> 00:30:08,101
that's a perfect circle.

527
00:30:09,591 --> 00:30:11,271
You said the ionization levels were off.

528
00:30:11,431 --> 00:30:13,355
- Could the sun cause that?
- There is no sun.

529
00:30:13,517 --> 00:30:14,691
Light is artificial.

530
00:30:14,851 --> 00:30:17,095
The spectrum could've changed
from something natural

531
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:19,529
to something containg
mutagenic wavelengths.

532
00:30:20,012 --> 00:30:22,157
So this could've been intentional.

533
00:30:22,317 --> 00:30:25,368
Like frying an ant
under a magnifying glass.

534
00:30:29,882 --> 00:30:31,306
Beautiful clouds.

535
00:30:34,286 --> 00:30:35,533
I miss you so much.

536
00:30:35,653 --> 00:30:39,024
Ever since the Sheriff showed up,
it's been so hard to talk to you.

537
00:30:39,257 --> 00:30:41,926
Well, it's not gonna get
any easier now.

538
00:30:43,378 --> 00:30:44,828
I don't understand.

539
00:30:46,336 --> 00:30:47,744
Derek can explain.

540
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,633
Can't you?

541
00:30:53,131 --> 00:30:55,123
<i>I never meant to hurt anybody.</i>

542
00:30:55,328 --> 00:30:57,901
Derek and Teri had
a long-distance thing going on.

543
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:01,153
No, I heard her talking to Bob about...
About the clouds.

544
00:31:01,314 --> 00:31:03,283
Yeah, but you didn't see Bob,
did you?

545
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,699
<i>She was talking to me
on the garden phone.</i>

546
00:31:05,884 --> 00:31:07,660
Yeah, a lot. I checked the log.

547
00:31:07,975 --> 00:31:10,694
<i>I saw the way Bob looked at Teri.
I didn't want her to get hurt.</i>

548
00:31:10,814 --> 00:31:12,373
But you hurt everyone else.

549
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:16,753
<i>I didn't realize that the sun
would affect the water supply. I just...</i>

550
00:31:17,633 --> 00:31:20,498
<i>I figured if Bob got sick,
he'd have to leave the lab.</i>

551
00:31:20,618 --> 00:31:23,843
<i>And when he got better,
he wouldn't be able to come back.</i>

552
00:31:24,006 --> 00:31:25,677
You did all that for me?

553
00:31:26,907 --> 00:31:28,342
<i>I love you, Teri.</i>

554
00:31:29,444 --> 00:31:31,935
<i>And we've never even
been able to hold hands.</i>

555
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:35,542
We had no idea you were so unhappy.

556
00:31:35,925 --> 00:31:38,649
- I wasn't. I'm not.
- We would've left.

557
00:31:38,822 --> 00:31:41,860
- We would've closed all of this up.
- But I didn't want you to.

558
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:45,031
I didn't wanna be the reason
that you lost the thing you loved.

559
00:31:45,454 --> 00:31:46,958
Oh, honey.

560
00:31:49,944 --> 00:31:51,885
So Rick and Grace
were the red herrings!

561
00:31:52,005 --> 00:31:53,998
I so did not see that coming.

562
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:57,074
This is the best season yet.

563
00:32:05,704 --> 00:32:06,825
Just coffee.

564
00:32:13,795 --> 00:32:14,947
And that'll be $25.

565
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,735
Better start a tab.

566
00:32:19,008 --> 00:32:21,561
I may want to have
some half and half.

567
00:32:28,124 --> 00:32:29,826
Enjoying the local color?

568
00:32:30,475 --> 00:32:31,487
I am.

569
00:32:32,088 --> 00:32:34,330
Observing the nuance
of your fine town.

570
00:32:34,726 --> 00:32:37,675
- You?
- I just came in to wash my hands.

571
00:32:37,795 --> 00:32:39,210
Is the water still free?

572
00:32:41,412 --> 00:32:44,091
And yours is on the house.

573
00:32:44,698 --> 00:32:48,338
Efficiency has its own elegance,
Deputy Lupo.

574
00:32:48,949 --> 00:32:51,973
Balancing a town, a company, a life.

575
00:32:52,386 --> 00:32:54,142
There's a certain beauty to it.

576
00:32:54,424 --> 00:32:57,393
Well, I will be sure to tell
that to the museum curator

577
00:32:57,513 --> 00:32:59,439
that I just sent packing.

578
00:32:59,768 --> 00:33:01,985
I know today was difficult,
but sometimes you have

579
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,318
to sacrifice a part
for the good of the whole.

580
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:08,031
So you're... You're saying
that one day we'll thank you.

581
00:33:08,378 --> 00:33:09,594
You might.

582
00:33:10,728 --> 00:33:13,244
I'm not your normal
corporate fixer, you know.

583
00:33:13,776 --> 00:33:16,933
Yeah, and...
Eureka is not your normal town.

584
00:33:17,275 --> 00:33:19,475
We've got our own balance.

585
00:33:20,022 --> 00:33:21,669
And you're messing with it.

586
00:33:28,482 --> 00:33:30,230
You look anxious to get outta here.

587
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,065
This place is freakin' me out.

588
00:33:32,185 --> 00:33:36,121
Lookin' forward to getting back
to some real sunshine, some fresh air.

589
00:33:37,201 --> 00:33:39,169
- Yeah. Sorry.
- Forget it.

590
00:33:39,749 --> 00:33:41,522
How long to get a fix on this mutation?

591
00:33:41,642 --> 00:33:43,961
We have targeted all
the processes that need to be reversed,

592
00:33:44,081 --> 00:33:46,986
but it might take us a few days
to figure out the treatment.

593
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:48,770
Few days?

594
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,366
That's all it took for Bob
to turn from pa...

595
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,726
He's taken Allison.
We may not even have minutes.

596
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,498
- What happened?
- We lost the feed.

597
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:15,534
I found Bob's trail. It's fresh.
He doesn't have much of a head start.

598
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:18,158
<i>I'll make sure the wind's against you
so he can't pick up your scent.</i>

599
00:34:18,278 --> 00:34:21,000
- Good. I'm heading out.
- And I'm heading in.

600
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,186
No, we need you on this end.

601
00:34:23,306 --> 00:34:26,561
We're close to reverse the gene.
But the delivery system's killing us.

602
00:34:26,681 --> 00:34:29,584
- It's gonna have to wait till later.
- They're changing down there.

603
00:34:29,704 --> 00:34:30,779
You saw Bob.

604
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,855
Look, they hit a point of no return,
it won't matter if we get them out.

605
00:34:34,318 --> 00:34:36,911
- Only thing that's gonna stop me is...
- <i>A gun.</i>

606
00:34:38,413 --> 00:34:39,956
That's a little extreme.

607
00:34:40,117 --> 00:34:42,792
<i>No. Your... Your gun thingy.</i>

608
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,960
<i>The biosensor you used
on Allison and me.</i>

609
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,380
- Bioballistic particle delivery system.
- Yes.

610
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:50,772
- We could modify it. Longer range.
- Larger bore, heavier payload.

611
00:34:50,892 --> 00:34:53,314
The timesink's gonna be fabrication.

612
00:34:55,568 --> 00:34:56,389
Unless...

613
00:35:01,971 --> 00:35:05,189
I need a gun.
A big powerful gun.

614
00:35:06,429 --> 00:35:09,652
I've been waiting for someone
to say that to me my whole life.

615
00:35:10,938 --> 00:35:12,221
Why would Bob take Allison?

616
00:35:12,341 --> 00:35:16,325
If we're talking about the human Bob,
he may think that she can help him.

617
00:35:16,485 --> 00:35:19,442
- No, the... The other. Snake Bob.
- Well, reptiles aren't exactly complex.

618
00:35:19,562 --> 00:35:21,134
Their needs are basic.

619
00:35:21,722 --> 00:35:23,526
You mean, like food.

620
00:35:24,277 --> 00:35:25,658
Fantastic.

621
00:35:56,128 --> 00:35:58,785
I thought you could use
a hunting buddy.

622
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:02,412
What part of hourly reports
does Stark not understand?

623
00:36:02,532 --> 00:36:03,587
He got anxious.

624
00:36:03,707 --> 00:36:05,840
The transition facility
is nearly complete.

625
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,272
The tactical team
that he ordered without authorization

626
00:36:08,392 --> 00:36:10,730
- is gonna be ready in ten minutes.
- We're not gonna need it.

627
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,218
How do you know that?

628
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:15,170
Carter, Henry, and Stark.
That's your money team.

629
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:17,690
They know exactly
what they're doing.

630
00:36:19,276 --> 00:36:21,148
You sure you know what you're doing?

631
00:36:21,268 --> 00:36:22,799
I have no idea.

632
00:36:26,431 --> 00:36:27,814
So I just shoot him, right?

633
00:36:27,974 --> 00:36:31,734
Bullet's an organic plastic
covered in plasma DNA.

634
00:36:31,894 --> 00:36:33,444
It should reverse the de-evolution.

635
00:36:34,071 --> 00:36:35,780
Let's do this thing.

636
00:36:41,801 --> 00:36:43,769
Takes it a second to warm up.

637
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:47,117
- You could've told me.
- Guys.

638
00:36:49,331 --> 00:36:51,295
Sorry. I came as fast as I could.

639
00:36:51,695 --> 00:36:54,811
- What's she doing here?
- I'm just glad she agreed.

640
00:36:59,322 --> 00:37:01,113
It's me. Teri.

641
00:37:01,633 --> 00:37:02,898
Bob likes Teri.

642
00:37:03,103 --> 00:37:06,475
In fact, she's the only woman down here
that he hasn't...

643
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,526
So you're trading Teri for Allison?

644
00:37:11,002 --> 00:37:12,109
Sorta.

645
00:37:45,268 --> 00:37:46,224
Thank you.

646
00:38:00,048 --> 00:38:01,907
Guys, it's Zane.
They saved Allison.

647
00:38:02,068 --> 00:38:03,868
Everybody is fine!

648
00:38:08,233 --> 00:38:09,954
I told you he'd be okay.

649
00:38:11,074 --> 00:38:14,086
What do you say
we just turn off the TV and read a book?

650
00:38:17,326 --> 00:38:20,053
- Told you they'd pull it off.
- Well, don't sell yourself short.

651
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:22,318
The redesign on that gun was inspired.

652
00:38:22,438 --> 00:38:25,263
- Well, we all do our part.
- I know you do.

653
00:38:25,714 --> 00:38:27,737
Talk to me about Henry Deacon.

654
00:38:34,295 --> 00:38:35,607
How you feelin'?

655
00:38:36,435 --> 00:38:37,892
Okay, I guess.

656
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:41,906
Gettin' shot kinda hurt.

657
00:38:42,266 --> 00:38:44,533
If you want to avoid that
in the future,

658
00:38:44,835 --> 00:38:47,870
you might wanna be
a little nicer to the ladies.

659
00:38:48,613 --> 00:38:50,163
Point taken, Sheriff.

660
00:38:50,425 --> 00:38:51,860
Learned my lesson.

661
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:54,585
And if there's any way
I could repay you...

662
00:38:58,624 --> 00:39:00,955
- Once a snake...
- Always a snake.

663
00:39:04,481 --> 00:39:06,889
- I just want to say thanks.
- Glad we could help.

664
00:39:07,188 --> 00:39:08,557
Is Derek going to jail?

665
00:39:09,197 --> 00:39:10,351
That's not up to me.

666
00:39:10,946 --> 00:39:12,575
I'd like to see him.

667
00:39:12,695 --> 00:39:14,396
Would mean
you'd have to leave the lab.

668
00:39:14,557 --> 00:39:17,740
Actually, we're thinking
that's not such a bad idea.

669
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:20,449
It's hard enough for a kid
to find their place in the world.

670
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:23,194
Especially when they've
only been to one place.

671
00:39:23,314 --> 00:39:24,363
'Scuse us.

672
00:39:26,733 --> 00:39:29,078
Henry, there's something
you need to see.

673
00:39:38,665 --> 00:39:40,308
We couldn't have done it without you.

674
00:39:40,428 --> 00:39:42,041
Technically, you did.

675
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:46,496
It's not gonna be the same
when you're gone.

676
00:39:48,366 --> 00:39:49,816
<i>Not by a long shot.</i>

677
00:39:53,822 --> 00:39:54,792
Thanks.

678
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,034
For the sunset.

679
00:40:13,886 --> 00:40:16,366
- How you feelin'?
- Much better.

680
00:40:16,906 --> 00:40:19,309
Thank you for keeping me
from turning into a snake

681
00:40:19,429 --> 00:40:22,048
- or being eaten by one.
- My pleasure.

682
00:40:22,786 --> 00:40:25,968
You know, that organic plastic we used
with the delivery system?

683
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:28,584
It's developed down in Lab 27.

684
00:40:28,704 --> 00:40:31,057
Discoveries come
from where we least expect them.

685
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:34,810
Yeah, well, I'll tell Thorne that
when she wants to shut the lab down.

686
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:35,936
Already did.

687
00:40:41,073 --> 00:40:43,861
Hey, I thought your shift
was over hours ago.

688
00:40:44,271 --> 00:40:46,572
Can't a girl bring her dad a burger
after a hard day's work?

689
00:40:47,304 --> 00:40:48,304
Sure.

690
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,079
I was really worried about you.

691
00:40:54,794 --> 00:40:55,914
Thanks.

692
00:41:05,837 --> 00:41:08,302
I was... I was worried about you too.

693
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:10,638
Why, Josefina, I'm touched.

694
00:41:10,798 --> 00:41:12,598
Don't get used to it.

695
00:41:13,681 --> 00:41:16,261
- Good to see Henry.
- Yeah. Yeah, it was.

696
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:20,568
No, it's... it's good to see Henry.

697
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:23,784
I don't know how to thank you
for my pardon.

698
00:41:24,521 --> 00:41:26,082
I'm sure it wasn't easy.

699
00:41:26,202 --> 00:41:27,780
You're right. It wasn't.

700
00:41:28,566 --> 00:41:30,166
I hope it's worth it.

701
00:41:31,081 --> 00:41:33,119
If you're bringing Henry back,

702
00:41:33,279 --> 00:41:35,078
the least I can do is buy you a beer

703
00:41:35,495 --> 00:41:37,695
'cause they now charge
for food around here.

704
00:41:37,815 --> 00:41:39,937
That's all back to the way
it belongs as well.

705
00:41:40,057 --> 00:41:41,413
Balance restored.

706
00:41:41,673 --> 00:41:43,796
Besides, single malt's more my style.

707
00:41:44,133 --> 00:41:45,548
Your secret's safe with me.

708
00:41:46,252 --> 00:41:47,496
Good to know.

709
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:50,307
- Good night, gentlemen.
- Good night.

710
00:41:55,685 --> 00:41:57,298
Just had to check.

711
00:41:59,373 --> 00:42:01,856
Listen, I'm not even sure
I should've come back.

712
00:42:02,846 --> 00:42:04,107
Of course you should.

713
00:42:05,784 --> 00:42:07,164
You're home.

714
00:42:14,133 --> 00:42:15,895
- How are you?
- Good.

715
00:42:20,555 --> 00:42:21,792
Things are lookin' up.
