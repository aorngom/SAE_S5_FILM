<i>Previously on</i> Eureka

2
00:00:02,813 --> 00:00:03,964
Sorry about Kim.

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,752
Nathan, I know you blame yourself
for what happened to Kim. Don't.

4
00:00:06,875 --> 00:00:07,982
It wasn't your fault.

5
00:00:08,151 --> 00:00:09,799
Wish I could be certain of that.

6
00:00:10,028 --> 00:00:11,029
I am.

7
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:13,448
<i>You were a good friend, Jack.</i>

8
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,772
I just feel bad
'cause I keep things from you.

9
00:00:16,848 --> 00:00:18,856
- What are you talking about?
- That Beverly stuff.

10
00:00:19,437 --> 00:00:20,730
<i>What she did to Kim.</i>

11
00:00:21,957 --> 00:00:23,213
What did she do to Kim?

12
00:00:25,168 --> 00:00:28,176
So you think you can put
this tragedy behind you.

13
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:30,064
<i>Never.</i>

14
00:00:31,513 --> 00:00:33,194
<i>But I can be motivated by it.</i>

15
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,505
No more than 18 inches from the curb.

16
00:00:41,614 --> 00:00:43,118
- Dad!
- Parallel to the sidewalk.

17
00:00:43,227 --> 00:00:45,482
I have my license.
We've done this a million times.

18
00:00:45,605 --> 00:00:47,752
And we're gonna do it
a million times more before

19
00:00:47,889 --> 00:00:50,363
you could go anywhere
without me. All right, turn it off.

20
00:00:50,513 --> 00:00:52,454
Didn't know it was
a down side to winning a car.

21
00:00:52,577 --> 00:00:54,477
Yeah, that's me. Your down side.

22
00:00:54,591 --> 00:00:55,761
Pop the trunk.

23
00:01:01,653 --> 00:01:03,921
Hey, I was... I was gonna come
and see you today,

24
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:05,756
- say Hi.
- Make sure I wasn't stupid.

25
00:01:07,126 --> 00:01:09,968
- Makes me sleep better.
- I'm fine, thanks.

26
00:01:13,088 --> 00:01:15,259
You... You said something the other day

27
00:01:15,382 --> 00:01:16,846
when you weren't yourself.

28
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,644
Something about Kim.

29
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:21,848
And...

30
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:24,033
What Beverly did to her.

31
00:01:24,935 --> 00:01:27,694
- You thought I should check it out.
- Did I say that?

32
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:33,108
If what you said was true,

33
00:01:33,231 --> 00:01:36,453
if Kim's death wasn't an accident...
If someone's responsible,

34
00:01:36,573 --> 00:01:38,315
- I promise you--
- I wasn't myself.

35
00:01:38,561 --> 00:01:39,750
But... But...

36
00:01:40,191 --> 00:01:41,792
thanks for checking up.

37
00:01:58,312 --> 00:02:00,652
There's no curbside service, you know?

38
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:03,522
- Hey Callie.
- Hey Jack.

39
00:02:04,056 --> 00:02:06,358
You want those cleaned?
Come on, we'll get you sorted out.

40
00:02:07,035 --> 00:02:08,881
Just a regular clean and a--

41
00:02:09,017 --> 00:02:10,986
Light starch, I know.

42
00:02:12,024 --> 00:02:14,324
You know, you'd be surprised
how much you can find out

43
00:02:14,444 --> 00:02:16,433
about a person from their dry cleaning.

44
00:02:16,622 --> 00:02:18,579
You are a strong crisp appearance

45
00:02:18,702 --> 00:02:20,580
with a soft flexible feel.

46
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,582
- I think it's a compliment.
- In a town full

47
00:02:22,702 --> 00:02:24,049
of max starch and creases?

48
00:02:24,172 --> 00:02:25,752
Trust me. It's a pleasure to do you.

49
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:27,862
I mean...

50
00:02:27,985 --> 00:02:29,798
clean you. Your uniform.

51
00:02:30,002 --> 00:02:31,466
Yeah, right.

52
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,094
Give me your arm.

53
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,558
Somebody had a breakfast burrito.

54
00:02:37,695 --> 00:02:39,308
- Yeah with ...
- With ketchup.

55
00:02:42,701 --> 00:02:44,896
- There you go.
- Ancient chinese secret?

56
00:02:45,339 --> 00:02:46,582
I'll never tell.

57
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,484
So are you doing anything
special to celebrate?

58
00:02:49,696 --> 00:02:50,997
Celebrate...

59
00:02:52,196 --> 00:02:54,823
- Cleaning my pants?
- It's your anniversary.

60
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:58,074
One year in Eureka,
says so right here in your file.

61
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,195
Are you...?

62
00:03:02,335 --> 00:03:04,221
Thanks for remembering. That's sweet.

63
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:07,918
You know, I figure everyone
around here is so focused on the future,

64
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:10,714
some of us need to live
in the present, right?

65
00:03:11,293 --> 00:03:13,393
Yeah. You're right.

66
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:16,118
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

67
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,835
- You know what today is?
- Self-adjusting volume.

68
00:03:25,182 --> 00:03:26,182
Oh, right.

69
00:03:26,427 --> 00:03:27,558
Guess what today is.

70
00:03:27,893 --> 00:03:29,733
Make your kid your chauffeur day.

71
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:31,241
Oh, you know the deal.

72
00:03:31,436 --> 00:03:33,361
You gotta get above
a B plus in everything,s

73
00:03:33,498 --> 00:03:34,884
before you get to fly solo.

74
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:36,921
And what was your high school's GPA?

75
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:38,669
Well...

76
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,037
You know, I...

77
00:03:40,242 --> 00:03:41,244
had issues.

78
00:03:43,454 --> 00:03:44,793
Hey, Joe. What's up?

79
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,732
Yeah, yeah. I'll be right there.

80
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:50,056
All right.

81
00:03:50,192 --> 00:03:51,786
Drop me off at the pharmacy.

82
00:03:52,115 --> 00:03:53,438
Yes, Miss Daisy.

83
00:03:53,718 --> 00:03:54,748
Oh, all right.

84
00:03:54,974 --> 00:03:56,450
All right, I'll walk.

85
00:03:56,832 --> 00:03:58,234
It's just a block.

86
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,723
You go straight to school.

87
00:04:02,244 --> 00:04:04,351
- Wait, by myself?
- Yeah.

88
00:04:05,383 --> 00:04:07,192
I had a... A 2.8.

89
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:10,536
I'll cut you some slack for
the genetic handicap. But, look at me.

90
00:04:10,714 --> 00:04:12,109
You go with no stops, no music,

91
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:14,445
- no friends, no cell phone, you got it?
- No problem.

92
00:04:14,568 --> 00:04:16,951
- Okay, look, I'm checking my mirrors.
- Good.

93
00:04:38,973 --> 00:04:40,749
Has this pharmacy never broke-in before?

94
00:04:40,886 --> 00:04:42,727
No. And I have been here 15 years.

95
00:04:44,274 --> 00:04:46,189
I know. Most people
don't even lock their doors.

96
00:04:46,312 --> 00:04:47,436
No, I mean this.

97
00:04:47,556 --> 00:04:49,272
Oh, that was developed years ago.

98
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:51,406
Still too expensive for mass production.

99
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:53,018
Eureka has its perks.

100
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,736
You know, if one day you could
just get me up to speed,

101
00:04:55,856 --> 00:04:57,184
that'd be great.

102
00:04:57,485 --> 00:04:59,489
So... what was taken?

103
00:04:59,609 --> 00:05:01,450
- Polyethylene glycol.
- Let me guess.

104
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,020
Permanent sun block.
Instant cavity filler.

105
00:05:04,157 --> 00:05:05,441
We keep those up front.

106
00:05:06,748 --> 00:05:08,330
Where was the glycole stored?

107
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:10,768
Outside here,
with the rest of the shipment.

108
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:12,762
That camera work?

109
00:05:13,445 --> 00:05:15,505
- 24 hours a day.
- Okay, we're gonna take a look at

110
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,654
the footage from last night.
Anything else missing?

111
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,009
Cash, drugs...

112
00:05:19,516 --> 00:05:20,729
Cure for cancer?

113
00:05:21,003 --> 00:05:22,383
Not a darn thing.

114
00:05:39,623 --> 00:05:41,782
My damsel in shining armor.
Can I get a lift?

115
00:05:42,773 --> 00:05:44,367
Sorry, Jasper. I promised my dad.

116
00:05:44,487 --> 00:05:47,829
Come on. It's two miles to school.
I'm a knight in distress here.

117
00:05:52,203 --> 00:05:55,371
- So you're saying it makes nothing?
- No, I'm saying it makes everything.

118
00:05:55,508 --> 00:05:57,561
Polyethylene glycol is a base.

119
00:05:57,684 --> 00:05:59,448
It's in shampoo, it's in motor oil,

120
00:05:59,598 --> 00:06:02,468
it was probably in the syrup that
you put on your pancakes this morning.

121
00:06:02,591 --> 00:06:04,778
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm doing the no carbs thing.

122
00:06:04,914 --> 00:06:06,842
- Which I think is working.
- Okay, Carter.

123
00:06:06,978 --> 00:06:09,042
I have a real emergency in section four.

124
00:06:09,165 --> 00:06:12,308
- Emergencies... Are my specialty.
- Great. Are you a lunar geologist?

125
00:06:12,431 --> 00:06:13,514
Yeah.

126
00:06:14,364 --> 00:06:16,816
- Something wrong with the moon?
- Just the pieces of it that

127
00:06:16,936 --> 00:06:17,936
we have here.

128
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:21,330
You have moon rocks here? That's...
I saw a bunch when I was a kid.

129
00:06:21,453 --> 00:06:23,298
My dad drove me
to Menlo Park just to see--

130
00:06:23,407 --> 00:06:25,430
- Fake ones.
- That's classified information.

131
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:28,041
What? He's a big enough boy now.
He should know the truth.

132
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,217
Come on.

133
00:06:29,353 --> 00:06:31,726
I had my nose pressed up
against a glass like other kids,

134
00:06:31,863 --> 00:06:34,180
- you tell me those things are just...
- Gravel.

135
00:06:34,476 --> 00:06:36,920
You really think we'd let
something alien on the public?

136
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,249
Yes.

137
00:06:39,492 --> 00:06:40,757
Oh, stop it.

138
00:06:40,877 --> 00:06:42,417
There's no such thing as...

139
00:06:43,363 --> 00:06:44,439
Kryptonite.

140
00:06:44,734 --> 00:06:46,638
Told you he was a big enough boy.

141
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,799
<i>These are the original moon rocks.</i>

142
00:06:48,922 --> 00:06:50,562
<i>But they didn't always look like this.</i>

143
00:06:50,698 --> 00:06:53,104
<i>Two days ago their molecular
structure began to change.</i>

144
00:06:53,241 --> 00:06:55,318
<i>Radioactive crystals started to form.</i>

145
00:06:55,441 --> 00:06:57,299
<i>Forty years of nothing. Now this.</i>

146
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,568
- <i>Tell him the scary part.</i>
- <i>That's not the scary part?</i>

147
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:01,829
We have two tons of them.

148
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:05,170
So if you'll stop pressing your nose
up against the power glass,

149
00:07:06,147 --> 00:07:08,594
we might be able to figure out
whether or not they're alive.

150
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,079
<i>That's awesome.</i>

151
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:17,586
Satellite radio Eureka style.

152
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,815
You got like a thousand channels.

153
00:07:19,938 --> 00:07:21,441
My dad told me it's a distraction.

154
00:07:21,578 --> 00:07:23,204
Okay. A big truck:

155
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:24,407
distraction.

156
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,428
You dad: definitely a distraction.

157
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,139
Me?

158
00:07:29,545 --> 00:07:30,599
Totally harmless.

159
00:07:37,212 --> 00:07:39,515
- You're okay?
- What the hell was that?

160
00:07:57,489 --> 00:07:59,334
There's nothing here.

161
00:08:02,275 --> 00:08:04,541
Like my dad's gonna believe that.

- Season 2 | Episode 9 -
Sight Unseen (v. 1.0)

168
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:40,707
I was paying attention.

169
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:42,707
Yeah, tell that to your front axel.

170
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:44,301
You did a number on this.

171
00:08:44,456 --> 00:08:46,007
It felt like I hit something.

172
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:48,389
You did hit something.
How many times have I told you?

173
00:08:48,498 --> 00:08:51,454
Keep your eyes on the road
at all times. You keep...

174
00:08:51,577 --> 00:08:54,099
If you don't believe me,
then just ask Jasper.

175
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:57,897
- There was someone with you?
- That's not why--

176
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,063
I told you. No friends, no distractions.

177
00:09:00,183 --> 00:09:03,158
That is why you didn't see what you hit.
School only. Until I say otherwise.

178
00:09:03,295 --> 00:09:05,181
And it just got bumped up to a 4.0.

179
00:09:06,321 --> 00:09:08,196
Heard you had an accident.
What did you hit?

180
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,783
Nothing. Will everyone just stop
interrogating me on this, please?

181
00:09:12,297 --> 00:09:14,536
Okay. We've got a call.

182
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:17,530
All right. Get in the jeep.
We'll give you a ride to school.

183
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:19,252
And the car stays here.

184
00:09:22,517 --> 00:09:25,004
Let's hope this is more exciting
than someone stealing shampoo.

185
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:27,779
That is a barking dog, yes.

186
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,094
- But what's it barking at?
- Who knows? All the day and night,

187
00:09:31,214 --> 00:09:33,930
it just wonders by our house
over there and starts making noise.

188
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,062
Reminds me of my husband.

189
00:09:36,896 --> 00:09:38,358
Ex-husband.

190
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:42,404
- So the dog's not yours?
- I'm a cat person.

191
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,792
Yeah. Hey, Jo, check this out.

192
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:48,903
It's empty.

193
00:09:49,249 --> 00:09:50,547
From the pharmacy.

194
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:55,310
Look at this.

195
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,430
What's going on?

196
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,167
<i>Something extremely dangerous.</i>

197
00:10:02,997 --> 00:10:05,618
It's important to realize
how the slightest change

198
00:10:05,754 --> 00:10:08,874
in balance, even on an atomic level,
can create chaos.

199
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:13,100
A simple error
in chemical formula calculation

200
00:10:13,236 --> 00:10:14,846
can cause disastrous volatility.

201
00:10:15,642 --> 00:10:18,676
Would someone please hand
Miss Carter the paper towels?

202
00:10:21,682 --> 00:10:22,470
Thank you.

203
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,101
Now. On to our next unit. Robotics.

204
00:10:25,974 --> 00:10:29,736
Our class will participate
in the annual ro-boxcar grand prix.

205
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:34,134
The most thrilling event
of the trimester.

206
00:10:35,546 --> 00:10:37,500
So pair off into two-person teams.

207
00:10:37,664 --> 00:10:38,870
You'll have 24 hours

208
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,384
to design and build

209
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:43,582
a vehicle that can achieve
a sustained speed of 85 miles per hour,

210
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:46,804
and withstand .90 GS on the skid pad.

211
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,915
Extra credit for style.

212
00:10:49,302 --> 00:10:50,757
Clearly Jasper thinks you're hot.

213
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:53,384
But not smart enough to be his partner.

214
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,418
In my opinion he's an idiot.

215
00:10:57,792 --> 00:10:59,807
No one usually asks my opinion.

216
00:11:00,306 --> 00:11:02,435
Does everyone have a partner?

217
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,138
Well, it looks
like we're stuck together.

218
00:11:07,905 --> 00:11:09,418
Welcome to my world.

219
00:11:09,681 --> 00:11:11,945
It's quiet, but it has its advantages.

220
00:11:13,084 --> 00:11:15,482
- Like what?
- Kidding. No advantages.

221
00:11:19,337 --> 00:11:20,375
I know.

222
00:11:20,498 --> 00:11:21,498
I'm Lucas.

223
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,957
We have three classes together.

224
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:25,994
Really?

225
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,151
Story of my life.

226
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:32,231
I'm sure you realize
that if you're right,

227
00:11:32,354 --> 00:11:35,525
and we can figure out why these rocks
have altered their molecular structure,

228
00:11:35,648 --> 00:11:38,299
that you'll be in line
for a second Nobel Prize.

229
00:11:38,586 --> 00:11:39,597
Measuring.

230
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,811
Your wall or the isotope ratio?

231
00:11:42,781 --> 00:11:44,448
First things first.

232
00:11:44,859 --> 00:11:46,942
Should give us some indication.

233
00:11:52,763 --> 00:11:54,959
<i>Decontamination sequence complete.</i>

234
00:11:58,347 --> 00:11:59,482
Did you...

235
00:12:00,138 --> 00:12:02,984
- Did you talk to Jack today?
- Couldn't avoid it.

236
00:12:03,158 --> 00:12:04,757
But I got to crush a childhood memory.

237
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,567
So it wasn't all bad.

238
00:12:07,109 --> 00:12:09,586
Did he mention anything about Kim or...

239
00:12:10,156 --> 00:12:11,551
the accident?

240
00:12:12,822 --> 00:12:13,829
No. Why would he?

241
00:12:14,394 --> 00:12:15,715
I think I said something

242
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,917
while we were all affected
by the GABA blockage.

243
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:20,680
What kind of thing?

244
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,184
That Kim's death wasn't an accident.

245
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:30,870
Knowing Carter,
he won't leave well enough alone.

246
00:12:32,312 --> 00:12:33,799
And hadn't you said you had proof

247
00:12:33,922 --> 00:12:36,112
that someone sabotaged the
experiment that killed Kim?

248
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:40,116
No. I said that I'd found something
that proved you weren't responsible.

249
00:12:40,441 --> 00:12:42,122
You need to give it to me.

250
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:45,330
- No, I don't.
- Henry, Carter's on to you.

251
00:12:45,703 --> 00:12:48,218
If he gets a hold of it,
turns it over to the government.

252
00:12:48,341 --> 00:12:50,815
You and I will no longer have access
to the artifact data

253
00:12:51,148 --> 00:12:52,858
or Kim's lab ever again.

254
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:57,850
I need to find out
what really happened to Kim.

255
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,922
We both have things
we're trying to protect.

256
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,431
Believe me.

257
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,541
You don't have a choice.

258
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,533
Pharmacist confirms the container
was stolen from his store,

259
00:13:17,656 --> 00:13:20,028
but not the syringe, or that bag.

260
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:24,728
Those items are pretty harmless
on their own, but who knows...

261
00:13:25,466 --> 00:13:28,186
What you can do if
you mix them together.

262
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:31,334
I'll... run those things
over to GD just as soon

263
00:13:31,454 --> 00:13:32,750
as I kill Zoe.

264
00:13:34,651 --> 00:13:35,925
Her car's gone.

265
00:13:40,227 --> 00:13:41,945
- The dry cleaner.
- Callie!

266
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:53,540
- Hey! You okay?
- Yeah.

267
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:55,426
I-I think so, but something's wrong.

268
00:13:55,562 --> 00:13:56,868
Yeah, come on.

269
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,569
Keep on.

270
00:14:15,836 --> 00:14:18,763
I'll give you guys...
more information when I have it.

271
00:14:19,922 --> 00:14:21,675
That was a hell of a blast. You're okay?

272
00:14:22,116 --> 00:14:23,052
What?

273
00:14:25,307 --> 00:14:26,597
What happened?

274
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:31,334
I don't know. I was just
mixing my formula as usual.

275
00:14:31,553 --> 00:14:34,097
Yeah... Is this stuff toxic?

276
00:14:34,984 --> 00:14:37,358
No, I don't keep anything locked.

277
00:14:38,483 --> 00:14:40,314
Not locked. Toxic.

278
00:14:40,615 --> 00:14:41,955
Hey, we're all clear in here.

279
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:44,101
- It's nothing lethal. Just a big mess.
- Okay.

280
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,719
God bless you too, Ed.

281
00:14:47,862 --> 00:14:49,065
Try rubbing them.

282
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,484
In love with him? No. I...

283
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,466
I'm totally single right now.

284
00:14:57,699 --> 00:14:58,872
Is that better?

285
00:14:59,653 --> 00:15:00,840
A little. Yeah.

286
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:03,551
And you didn't ask
about my love life, did you?

287
00:15:05,047 --> 00:15:06,053
No.

288
00:15:09,672 --> 00:15:10,641
It's okay.

289
00:15:11,108 --> 00:15:13,186
Come on. Show me what happened.

290
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,088
Oh, my God.

291
00:15:22,482 --> 00:15:23,767
It's not exactly...

292
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:25,434
fluff and fold.

293
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:28,020
I have an off-site lab permit.

294
00:15:28,168 --> 00:15:30,369
My cleaning formula is kind of involved.

295
00:15:30,489 --> 00:15:32,204
Yeah, I gathered.

296
00:15:34,345 --> 00:15:35,507
What happened?

297
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,921
I don't know.

298
00:15:37,475 --> 00:15:39,670
I must've measured my mixture wrong.

299
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,043
Has...

300
00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:44,091
Has anyone been in here?
Is there something missing?

301
00:15:44,405 --> 00:15:45,594
No, I don't think so.

302
00:15:45,717 --> 00:15:47,139
It's just me, why?

303
00:15:47,521 --> 00:15:50,405
Somebody stole a chemical
from the pharmacy.

304
00:15:50,925 --> 00:15:52,516
They might have stolen something here.

305
00:15:52,636 --> 00:15:54,560
A change of the formula
caused the explosion.

306
00:15:54,751 --> 00:15:56,645
Well, my ratios are pretty specific.

307
00:15:57,364 --> 00:15:58,868
If I could get a...

308
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,262
a sample... of what you mixed
this morning

309
00:16:01,382 --> 00:16:03,519
I could give it to Henry,
and he could take a look.

310
00:16:03,724 --> 00:16:05,396
One sample coming up.

311
00:16:06,676 --> 00:16:08,435
That's... great.

312
00:16:09,328 --> 00:16:10,545
Nice.

313
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,922
Thank you.

314
00:16:14,548 --> 00:16:16,874
You probably saved my life today, Jack.

315
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,403
Pure self-interest.

316
00:16:19,608 --> 00:16:20,701
I spill a lot.

317
00:16:20,838 --> 00:16:23,169
Maybe I can help you out with that.

318
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:27,176
Let me take you out for dinner tonight.
Please, it's the least I can do.

319
00:16:27,781 --> 00:16:29,188
Yeah, dinner...

320
00:16:29,393 --> 00:16:30,971
Yeah, I mean the idea is great...

321
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,557
- But--
- Did you just say Café Diem at eight?

322
00:16:34,191 --> 00:16:35,306
Perfect.

323
00:16:36,432 --> 00:16:37,494
Sure.

324
00:16:38,085 --> 00:16:40,474
Yeah. It's a date.

325
00:16:42,117 --> 00:16:43,306
A date?

326
00:16:45,436 --> 00:16:46,987
Sorry. Yeah, no. I... It's not...

327
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:48,757
- We could...
- I hope the bad guys

328
00:16:48,894 --> 00:16:50,753
can't fool you that easily.

329
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:52,869
Yeah.

330
00:16:53,989 --> 00:16:56,143
Still think those are
ET's moon rocks, huh?

331
00:16:56,294 --> 00:16:58,495
Never rule anything out.

332
00:17:01,132 --> 00:17:02,878
You sure you got time to do this?

333
00:17:02,998 --> 00:17:05,441
I've already figured out what
happened to change these rocks.

334
00:17:05,562 --> 00:17:07,622
They're missing an element
called Aluminum 26,

335
00:17:07,731 --> 00:17:10,547
it'll probably take the rest of
my life to figure out how that happened.

336
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,678
So I might as well support
my local Sheriff in the meantime.

337
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:18,352
This is... Callie's formula and
a sample of what she mixed today.

338
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:21,146
And this is the stuff
that I found in the woods.

339
00:17:23,545 --> 00:17:25,910
So... What did you say
was missing from the moon rocks?

340
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:30,341
Aluminum 26.
A highly unstable radioactive element.

341
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,522
Well, somebody's
been stealing chemicals.

342
00:17:33,645 --> 00:17:35,422
What if they stole that too?

343
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,107
All things being possible, these rocks
are under 24-hour surveillance,

344
00:17:39,202 --> 00:17:42,447
under lock and key, so once again,
the question becomes "how?"

345
00:17:43,502 --> 00:17:46,400
besides, extracting Al-26
from moon rocks would require

346
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,799
a sophisticated process,
you'd have to be trained...

347
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:51,225
You mean like... like everyone in town.

348
00:17:51,884 --> 00:17:54,028
- Gotcha. I'll check it out.
- Thanks.

349
00:17:55,426 --> 00:17:56,500
One more thing.

350
00:17:57,556 --> 00:18:00,921
I don't suppose by any chance you've
towed Zoe's car to your garage today?

351
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,191
- No.
- Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.

352
00:18:10,827 --> 00:18:13,637
- <i>What's going on?</i>
- I'm sealing off this chamber.

353
00:18:20,688 --> 00:18:21,772
Just got started.

354
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,413
<i>Well, we have a bigger problem now.</i>

355
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,670
Traces of radioactive material
have been found throughout the building.

356
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,207
It could come from anywhere.

357
00:18:28,389 --> 00:18:30,424
With aluminum 26 isotopes?

358
00:18:30,822 --> 00:18:32,344
Probably happened during transport.

359
00:18:32,463 --> 00:18:35,387
Well, that's what I thought
until we realized that it's on the move.

360
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,642
- What?
- <i>Every time we try to contain</i>

361
00:18:37,765 --> 00:18:39,224
<i>the radioactivity,</i>

362
00:18:39,346 --> 00:18:41,716
it escapes, it moves, it hides.

363
00:18:47,676 --> 00:18:50,587
Allison, we are sitting
on two tons of these rocks.

364
00:18:50,724 --> 00:18:53,457
If there is a lifeform there,
we need to study it.

365
00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:55,742
I would rather err
on the side of caution.

366
00:18:55,878 --> 00:18:56,958
Implying I wouldn't.

367
00:18:57,081 --> 00:18:59,541
Last time something like this
escaped from a lab at GD

368
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:01,291
it ended up in my son.

369
00:19:02,907 --> 00:19:06,078
So the chassis needs to withstand
at least a G if we want to get an A.

370
00:19:06,215 --> 00:19:08,661
Who cares about the A?
It's about the experience.

371
00:19:08,921 --> 00:19:11,508
What? I thought you were
all about the grades.

372
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:13,704
Why? Because that fits the stereotype

373
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,836
nerd/geek/loser mold

374
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:18,175
that hot girls like you put me into?

375
00:19:18,998 --> 00:19:21,934
No, because I'm all about the grades,
and I wanted an A,

376
00:19:22,054 --> 00:19:24,649
and I was hoping
that my partner might too.

377
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,857
If you say so.

378
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,900
And I'm not hot.

379
00:19:31,401 --> 00:19:33,958
- You're just fishing for compliments.
- Okay, can we just...

380
00:19:34,094 --> 00:19:35,983
Stick to the work, please?

381
00:19:36,496 --> 00:19:39,092
Sorry. I didn't mean
to distract you with all the...

382
00:19:39,215 --> 00:19:40,514
verbal sparring and the...

383
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,413
sudden sexual tension between us.

384
00:19:43,857 --> 00:19:45,716
Please, you're so not my type.

385
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:48,713
That's what they all say.

386
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:52,061
Until they fall madly in love with you?

387
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,591
No.

388
00:19:53,728 --> 00:19:56,448
That's what they all actually say.

389
00:20:02,528 --> 00:20:04,017
You find anything on those tapes?

390
00:20:04,408 --> 00:20:06,186
Nope. I found nothing.

391
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:09,648
- Great, Jo. That's helpful.
- No, no, no.

392
00:20:09,768 --> 00:20:11,191
I found nothing. Take a look.

393
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:17,401
At what?

394
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:18,727
Okay, watch closely.

395
00:20:19,422 --> 00:20:20,909
Those boxes? There, see?

396
00:20:23,787 --> 00:20:25,058
What was that?

397
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:27,730
You mean who is that.

398
00:20:28,263 --> 00:20:30,294
I think we may be looking for

399
00:20:30,414 --> 00:20:31,879
an invisible thief.

400
00:20:35,575 --> 00:20:36,633
Cafe Diem?

401
00:20:36,753 --> 00:20:38,177
I've been looking all over for you.

402
00:20:38,297 --> 00:20:40,971
- It's school related. Not sexual.
- Yeah, where's your car?

403
00:20:41,091 --> 00:20:42,890
- Where I parked it.
- Great, okay.

404
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,261
Give me the keys.

405
00:20:44,975 --> 00:20:47,219
Oh, come on Dad. He's so not worth
breaking grounded for.

406
00:20:47,352 --> 00:20:48,729
No, this isn't about him.

407
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:51,518
This is about what you hit.
I think I know why you didn't see it.

408
00:21:54,449 --> 00:21:55,963
My car, it's...

409
00:21:56,794 --> 00:21:57,915
Invisible.

410
00:22:00,555 --> 00:22:02,578
You just hate it when I'm right,
don't you?

411
00:22:02,701 --> 00:22:04,096
Especially when I can't fix it.

412
00:22:07,739 --> 00:22:10,842
Invisibility was abandoned before
anybody could really figure it out.

413
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:12,788
Somebody figured it out.

414
00:22:14,267 --> 00:22:16,024
Make way, national security.

415
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:19,195
Just looking at this
could be a federal offense.

416
00:22:19,358 --> 00:22:21,446
Ms. Blake needs this car towed
to GD immediately.

417
00:22:21,902 --> 00:22:24,824
Can't you just spray it
with some special...

418
00:22:25,152 --> 00:22:27,650
GD potion and make it come back?

419
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:29,656
Invisibility is illegal, Jack.

420
00:22:29,802 --> 00:22:32,047
So whoever's been working on this,
is doing it in secret.

421
00:22:32,202 --> 00:22:33,998
You can't reverse
what you don't understand.

422
00:22:34,151 --> 00:22:35,454
Oh, come on. No...

423
00:22:35,794 --> 00:22:39,256
spectrum super charger,
or like night vision goggles, or...

424
00:22:39,665 --> 00:22:41,758
like an infrared mega-thingy?

425
00:22:42,524 --> 00:22:43,524
No.

426
00:22:44,022 --> 00:22:44,845
Actually...

427
00:22:44,965 --> 00:22:48,432
There is an infrared mega-thingy.

428
00:22:50,793 --> 00:22:53,148
I realized
the infrared spatial technology

429
00:22:53,282 --> 00:22:55,415
developed for non x-ray tumor detection

430
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:57,765
might work on anything
with an invisible mass.

431
00:22:58,253 --> 00:22:59,318
Can you see it?

432
00:22:59,438 --> 00:23:01,300
Yeah, perfectly.
We're all gonna need one.

433
00:23:01,722 --> 00:23:04,561
- Prototype. Only one exists.
- We have to figure out who did this,

434
00:23:04,711 --> 00:23:07,083
before someone discovers
that we broke the treaty.

435
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,722
Hold on. I'm the law on this town.

436
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,260
How can something be illegal
if I don't even know it exists.

437
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,410
GD was working on invisibility
in the late 90s.

438
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,711
At that point the concept
was only theoretical.

439
00:23:17,913 --> 00:23:20,869
But Aluminum 26 was the key
ingredient in the formula.

440
00:23:21,015 --> 00:23:24,635
After 9/11, it was shut down. Along with
miniaturization and teleportation.

441
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,095
- So how do you explain this?
- Your theory was correct.

442
00:23:27,215 --> 00:23:28,889
Your thefts and our thefts are related.

443
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:33,589
Someone's ignoring the ban and using
Al-26 extracted from the moon rocks.

444
00:23:33,761 --> 00:23:36,230
So we really are looking
for the invisible man?

445
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:37,981
Or woman.

446
00:23:38,821 --> 00:23:42,238
In that bag that you found
was a chemical called PCE.

447
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:47,741
Callie Curie uses PCE
in her dry cleaning formula.

448
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,459
All right. Maybe it was stolen from her.

449
00:23:51,593 --> 00:23:53,834
Or maybe she's been using
her business as a cover

450
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:56,545
for further experiments
for the past seven years.

451
00:23:57,266 --> 00:24:00,088
She was part of the original
invisibility team.

452
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:14,111
Vincent just came by.
Brought me a cappuccino.

453
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:18,405
So I asked him to make us baked alaska
tonight in honor of the explosion.

454
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,701
You don't like baked alaska?

455
00:24:23,148 --> 00:24:24,969
What've you been doing in here, Callie?

456
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:28,435
Getting out those stubborn stains.

457
00:24:30,577 --> 00:24:32,434
Is there any chance that...

458
00:24:32,891 --> 00:24:35,047
Invisibility was the key
to your success?

459
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:37,741
What are you talking about?

460
00:24:38,114 --> 00:24:40,855
I know that was the focus
of your research before you started...

461
00:24:41,075 --> 00:24:42,075
Doing this.

462
00:24:42,203 --> 00:24:43,203
Yeah.

463
00:24:43,327 --> 00:24:44,327
It was.

464
00:24:44,703 --> 00:24:47,199
And it wasn't healthy.
It was all I had time for.

465
00:24:47,771 --> 00:24:49,999
That's why I started doing this.
I wanted...

466
00:24:50,387 --> 00:24:52,498
a real life, normal hours...

467
00:24:53,412 --> 00:24:54,308
Maybe...

468
00:24:54,428 --> 00:24:55,517
A boyfriend.

469
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:02,532
When the... When the treaty
shut down your project

470
00:25:03,219 --> 00:25:06,600
did you start this business
so you could continue your work?

471
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,407
I was relieved when they shut us down.
It gave me an excuse to get out.

472
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:18,267
Look, I may have adapted some of my
research, but it's all perfectly safe...

473
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:19,497
And legal.

474
00:25:20,029 --> 00:25:22,794
So that was just a coincidence?
That the day your lab explodes,

475
00:25:22,914 --> 00:25:25,464
my daughter's car turns invisible
right down the street?

476
00:25:26,605 --> 00:25:29,820
Well, okay, first of all, are you saying
that someone's actually done this?

477
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,059
Because... without a large amount
of Aluminum 26, that's not possible.

478
00:25:34,193 --> 00:25:37,684
Stolen from the unstable
compounds lab at GD where

479
00:25:37,804 --> 00:25:39,609
you worked for eight years.

480
00:25:42,232 --> 00:25:44,566
I thought that you were
a better judge of character.

481
00:25:46,774 --> 00:25:48,820
Sometimes I don't like my job.

482
00:25:49,194 --> 00:25:51,843
My GD clearance was revoked
when the treaty was signed,

483
00:25:51,997 --> 00:25:55,079
and I haven't set foot in that
building since. You don't believe me...

484
00:25:55,835 --> 00:25:57,594
Check the security records.

485
00:25:58,531 --> 00:26:01,353
I'm gonna need the names of everybody
you worked with on that team,

486
00:26:01,531 --> 00:26:02,708
gotta check them out.

487
00:26:04,619 --> 00:26:05,619
Fine.

488
00:26:05,993 --> 00:26:08,012
Sometimes I don't like your job either.

489
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:14,888
We have radiation trace
readings everywhere.

490
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:17,311
18 locations, no discernable pattern.

491
00:26:18,086 --> 00:26:20,086
Looks like they're using
the air ducts to travel.

492
00:26:20,219 --> 00:26:23,248
Great. Just what we need:
airborne-intelligent radioactive life.

493
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:24,498
From space?

494
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,817
Can we put a bell on him or something?

495
00:26:26,937 --> 00:26:28,697
Every time we have
a part of it cornered,

496
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,173
it moves, like it knows
we're chasing it.

497
00:26:31,454 --> 00:26:34,004
Right now, the levels aren't harmful.
But if they get any higher,

498
00:26:34,124 --> 00:26:37,359
I'm going to have to evacuate
the building, maybe even the town.

499
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:40,789
Carter, please tell me you've
figured out this invisibility problem.

500
00:26:41,588 --> 00:26:43,343
Tell me about Frank Phillips.

501
00:26:44,283 --> 00:26:47,254
He's a surveillance specialist.
Why do you need to know?

502
00:26:47,374 --> 00:26:49,631
I'm confronting Callie's list.
What was he before?

503
00:26:50,563 --> 00:26:54,187
DOD had me put him on the invisibility
team for a short while.

504
00:26:55,608 --> 00:26:56,623
Where is he?

505
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:02,384
He's a CIA surveillance specialist.
A spook's spook.

506
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,982
An enigma. He's so private
he won't even look in a mirror.

507
00:27:05,116 --> 00:27:08,317
- You can't tell him I let you in.
- Fargo, it's an official investigation.

508
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,326
- But if he finds out...
- He's the only member

509
00:27:10,449 --> 00:27:12,306
of the invisibility team
who still works here.

510
00:27:12,426 --> 00:27:15,059
And the person who stole
Aluminum 26 had that GD access.

511
00:27:15,182 --> 00:27:18,038
They say he killed a man in Borneo
just to watch him die.

512
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,427
I think you've seen too many spy movies.

513
00:27:22,001 --> 00:27:23,587
Just unlock the door.

514
00:27:26,006 --> 00:27:27,359
What if he's in there?

515
00:27:27,619 --> 00:27:29,546
No one's seen him in two weeks.

516
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:32,566
Exactly.
What if he's in there, invisible,

517
00:27:32,703 --> 00:27:35,368
with a poison blow gun
from Borneo, waiting?

518
00:27:35,995 --> 00:27:36,995
Just...

519
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,294
Then he'll get you first.

520
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:50,876
Guy's been here for 15 years.
You think he'd put a picture up.

521
00:27:51,094 --> 00:27:52,489
He might still be here.

522
00:27:55,263 --> 00:27:57,874
- You start with his computer.
- Me?

523
00:27:58,187 --> 00:28:00,141
He's already gonna kill you
for opening the door.

524
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:01,828
Why risk anyone else?

525
00:28:09,503 --> 00:28:11,245
What's supposed to be in here?

526
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,851
Lincoln would know.

527
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,077
The poop guy.

528
00:28:19,234 --> 00:28:20,683
The poop guy.

529
00:28:22,636 --> 00:28:24,248
Some offices have a plant guy.

530
00:28:24,387 --> 00:28:26,478
I'm the poop guy. Not glamorous,

531
00:28:26,598 --> 00:28:27,612
but it's work.

532
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:29,731
I found an empty cage
in Frank Phillip's office.

533
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:31,411
My favorite kind.

534
00:28:32,094 --> 00:28:34,417
- You got any idea what was in there?
- Mice.

535
00:28:34,568 --> 00:28:36,683
18 of them. Cute, white ones.

536
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:38,873
Not the rats they feed
all that artificial sweetener

537
00:28:38,996 --> 00:28:41,120
to see how long
it'll take them to explode.

538
00:28:42,576 --> 00:28:44,490
Did you say 18?

539
00:28:49,553 --> 00:28:51,016
That's all of them.

540
00:28:53,372 --> 00:28:55,840
I never would've spotted them
without this headgear.

541
00:28:55,977 --> 00:28:57,467
- Mind if I keep it?
- Yes.

542
00:28:58,191 --> 00:28:59,678
You're welcome.

543
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,763
Well,

544
00:29:02,271 --> 00:29:05,073
little, white mice.
Not little, green men.

545
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,852
Alien problem solved. No extra charge.

546
00:29:08,145 --> 00:29:11,314
These little guys are the 18 hotspots
running around the building.

547
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:14,651
Radiation poisoning
will kill them within 24 hours.

548
00:29:15,592 --> 00:29:17,862
- How'd they get exposed to radiation?
- I don't know.

549
00:29:17,982 --> 00:29:20,420
Al-26. Works as a viral pathogen.

550
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,864
But only subcutaneous exposure
is dangerous.

551
00:29:23,001 --> 00:29:25,822
Frank Phillips must've used
the mice as test subjects.

552
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:28,836
But why would he make them invisible
if he knew it would kill them?

553
00:29:28,974 --> 00:29:31,157
Maybe you don't use Al-26
to make something invisible,

554
00:29:31,281 --> 00:29:33,128
you use it to make something come back.

555
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:35,737
He figured out
the formula for invisibility,

556
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,465
but not the reversal.

557
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:40,618
Well, he must be desperate to use Al-26.

558
00:29:40,754 --> 00:29:42,286
He's got experience to extract it,

559
00:29:42,409 --> 00:29:44,556
but there's no way
he'll find an answer alone.

560
00:29:44,687 --> 00:29:46,688
And... what's the effect on humans?

561
00:29:46,838 --> 00:29:49,134
Only subjects with direct exposure, say,

562
00:29:49,298 --> 00:29:51,479
through an injection are at risk.

563
00:29:53,842 --> 00:29:55,567
Or a cut on the hand.

564
00:30:08,215 --> 00:30:09,602
So, what can we do?

565
00:30:09,739 --> 00:30:12,212
The invisibility formula attacks
organic cells,

566
00:30:12,413 --> 00:30:16,295
mice, Carter, Carter's clothes.
Callie's dry cleaning formula

567
00:30:16,432 --> 00:30:19,418
contains tiny microbes that
continue washing in between cleanings.

568
00:30:19,582 --> 00:30:21,432
Leave it to Eureka.
And what about the car?

569
00:30:21,841 --> 00:30:23,584
Encased in an organic polymer wrap,

570
00:30:23,704 --> 00:30:26,610
a kind of "super skin" developed in
the genetics lab to help burn victims.

571
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:28,647
And apparently it's really good
on minor dings.

572
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,186
Henry thinks Carter got exposed
when he cut his hand on the windshield.

573
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:33,935
It's spreading through his entire body.

574
00:30:34,058 --> 00:30:36,609
- Radioactive viral pathogen.
- From hell.

575
00:30:39,762 --> 00:30:41,785
- Did you check on Zoe?
- She's fine.

576
00:30:41,922 --> 00:30:43,370
Joe's with her while you're here.

577
00:30:43,589 --> 00:30:44,731
Okay.

578
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:47,553
I don't want her to know.

579
00:30:48,337 --> 00:30:50,878
Okay. Not until we fix this.

580
00:30:58,641 --> 00:31:00,137
Al-26 radiation.

581
00:31:00,257 --> 00:31:02,031
It's highly toxic to your system.

582
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:05,184
And if we can't reverse
the process in 24 hours,

583
00:31:05,304 --> 00:31:06,804
we won't be able to risk this...

584
00:31:06,927 --> 00:31:08,020
at all.

585
00:31:10,043 --> 00:31:11,751
So I'll be invisible forever?

586
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,279
I'll be dead and invisible forever.

587
00:31:26,347 --> 00:31:28,397
We'll never make it.
We have 15 hours left.

588
00:31:28,545 --> 00:31:29,859
That's the point.

589
00:31:30,023 --> 00:31:32,825
Anyone could figure this out if
they had all the time in the world.

590
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:34,463
How can you be so cool about this?

591
00:31:35,482 --> 00:31:38,593
I'm not cool as you've
repeatedly pointed out.

592
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,312
I just know who I am
and what I'm capable of.

593
00:31:41,435 --> 00:31:43,335
I know I'll be a lot happier
when Joe gets back

594
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:45,782
from the hardware store
with those cooling rods.

595
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:47,482
I think you're missing the point.

596
00:31:47,659 --> 00:31:48,767
The point?

597
00:31:49,204 --> 00:31:51,981
The point is if I don't get straight as,
I don't get to drive.

598
00:31:52,533 --> 00:31:54,460
I'm talking about the big picture.

599
00:31:54,652 --> 00:31:56,811
You get distracted by all the crap.

600
00:31:57,714 --> 00:31:59,478
You can't see
what's right in front of you.

601
00:31:59,598 --> 00:32:00,598
Like what?

602
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:02,196
Like me.

603
00:32:03,413 --> 00:32:06,062
Think of everything you've missed
because you made a snap judgment

604
00:32:06,186 --> 00:32:07,788
and decided that...

605
00:32:08,264 --> 00:32:09,686
I wasn't your type.

606
00:32:10,287 --> 00:32:12,994
Please. All I've missed is
you telling me how shallow I am.

607
00:32:13,608 --> 00:32:14,743
And this.

608
00:32:20,266 --> 00:32:21,420
You're not shallow.

609
00:32:22,616 --> 00:32:24,789
You just haven't explored your depth.

610
00:32:25,623 --> 00:32:27,263
No, no, no.

611
00:32:28,889 --> 00:32:30,720
No exploring on my watch.

612
00:32:31,321 --> 00:32:32,387
We clear?

613
00:32:33,263 --> 00:32:34,899
<i>So how long has this been going on?</i>

614
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,842
Started a few hours ago.
Thought you'd help.

615
00:32:36,965 --> 00:32:39,986
- What's the rate of progression?
- Faster than we would like.

616
00:32:41,473 --> 00:32:43,701
He'll be completely invisible
within an hour.

617
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:45,204
Hi, Callie.

618
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:46,790
Oh, my god.

619
00:32:47,357 --> 00:32:50,205
If you didn't wanna go out to dinner,
you could've just said so.

620
00:32:51,126 --> 00:32:53,751
If you could work with
Nathan Stark and Henry Deacon and

621
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:56,295
help them figure out how to reverse it.

622
00:32:56,415 --> 00:32:59,798
And if you could tell us everything
you can remember about Frank Phillips.

623
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,212
We called him "Frank the Spook",

624
00:33:02,349 --> 00:33:04,845
very intense. Not the warm, fuzzy type.

625
00:33:04,965 --> 00:33:06,203
We know that he was CIA.

626
00:33:06,326 --> 00:33:08,964
But what did he have to do
with the original invisibility team?

627
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:10,904
The DOD had us working with the CIA

628
00:33:11,027 --> 00:33:13,225
on finding a way to make
their operatives truly stealth.

629
00:33:13,345 --> 00:33:14,355
Invisible spies?

630
00:33:14,747 --> 00:33:17,524
We were years away from human testing.
But, yeah, that was the goal.

631
00:33:18,169 --> 00:33:21,790
I think Frank the Spook may have carried
the ball over the goal line by himself.

632
00:33:21,931 --> 00:33:23,763
He had the rudimentary
scientific background

633
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,005
but it's unlikely he could've
succeeded on his own.

634
00:33:26,128 --> 00:33:28,858
We need to find him and find out
what he did. Or else, Carter...

635
00:33:30,949 --> 00:33:33,290
Is there anywhere he used to talk about?

636
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:34,982
Someplace he used to go?

637
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:39,013
You know, I ran into him once
near Strawberry Knoll.

638
00:33:39,136 --> 00:33:42,091
And I remember that he had
lots of supplies but no camping gear.

639
00:33:42,649 --> 00:33:45,916
The dog that was barking at nothing
was over by Strawberry Knoll.

640
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:50,732
He's gonna kill me.

641
00:33:50,881 --> 00:33:52,220
I'm gonna die.

642
00:33:53,642 --> 00:33:56,021
- Wrong direction.
- Stop sneaking up on me like that.

643
00:33:56,258 --> 00:33:58,275
I'm invisible, Fargo.

644
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:00,749
- I thought you were Frank.
- Come on.

645
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,945
The dog was barking where
we found the chemicals.

646
00:34:03,065 --> 00:34:04,238
I think Frank's hideout

647
00:34:04,358 --> 00:34:05,970
- has to be somewhere.
- Look out...

648
00:34:06,339 --> 00:34:07,616
For the invisible shed.

649
00:34:08,074 --> 00:34:09,167
Gimme those.

650
00:34:09,495 --> 00:34:10,561
Okay.

651
00:34:13,911 --> 00:34:15,674
This shed's made of metal.

652
00:34:15,865 --> 00:34:18,667
Maybe it's covered in the same stuff
that was on Zoe's car.

653
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,513
Is that even possible?

654
00:34:20,734 --> 00:34:22,604
Asks the invisible Sheriff.

655
00:34:25,447 --> 00:34:26,635
What if he's in there?

656
00:34:28,645 --> 00:34:29,984
There's no one here.

657
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:31,765
Good. Let's go.

658
00:34:31,885 --> 00:34:33,910
- This place is creepy.
- You can see all this?

659
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,134
Of course. Remember.

660
00:34:35,254 --> 00:34:38,174
The skin makes the outside
of the shed invisible, not the inside.

661
00:34:38,296 --> 00:34:39,606
At least we've his research.

662
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,565
Here. Put these on.

663
00:34:42,098 --> 00:34:43,318
- Let's go.
- Where?

664
00:34:45,433 --> 00:34:47,333
Dogs don't bark at nothing.

665
00:34:53,878 --> 00:34:55,942
This is where Zoe had her accident.

666
00:34:56,202 --> 00:34:58,375
Wait, wait, wait.
There's something right there.

667
00:34:59,892 --> 00:35:01,067
What is it?

668
00:35:02,837 --> 00:35:04,162
It's Frank, isn't it?

669
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:05,762
Unfortunately.

670
00:35:06,749 --> 00:35:07,812
He's dead?

671
00:35:08,112 --> 00:35:09,178
Pretty much.

672
00:35:12,418 --> 00:35:13,500
Zoe hit him.

673
00:35:16,463 --> 00:35:18,986
Somehow I don't think
it was a car that killed him.

674
00:35:28,722 --> 00:35:31,360
<i>This is really bad,
Carter's completely gone.</i>

675
00:35:31,551 --> 00:35:33,014
<i>We have to help him.</i>

676
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:35,616
Henry's finishing the autopsy
on Frank Phillips.

677
00:35:35,825 --> 00:35:38,121
His radiation level was beyond lethal.

678
00:35:38,271 --> 00:35:40,594
He was definitely a corpse
before Zoe hit him.

679
00:35:40,725 --> 00:35:42,706
He must've just dropped dead
the side of the road.

680
00:35:42,826 --> 00:35:45,543
What about the formula Carter found
in the shed? Can we reverse it?

681
00:35:45,663 --> 00:35:48,421
Callie's working on it. But unless
we find something in a few hours...

682
00:35:48,541 --> 00:35:51,561
The radiation exposure
will be just as lethal as Frank's.

683
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:53,099
I hate this.

684
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:56,095
All this technology and we can't heal
what really matters.

685
00:35:57,798 --> 00:35:59,855
You know what? Let's find Fargo.

686
00:36:00,942 --> 00:36:03,456
Let's get the specs on Zoe's Smart car.

687
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,844
And tell him we need
14 square feet of his skin.

688
00:36:13,475 --> 00:36:14,965
Beginning incision.

689
00:36:26,105 --> 00:36:27,668
This is what's invisible.

690
00:36:29,016 --> 00:36:30,463
It's the car's organic wrap.

691
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:33,090
It's a human skin base,
but it absorbs damage

692
00:36:33,634 --> 00:36:35,438
and heals much faster
than the human body.

693
00:36:35,575 --> 00:36:38,144
Rather brilliant innovation,
if I may say so myself.

694
00:36:38,295 --> 00:36:40,190
Well, let's just hope
it heals fast enough

695
00:36:40,328 --> 00:36:42,583
to shed the radioactive byproducts

696
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:44,605
once we reverse
the invisibility formula.

697
00:36:44,742 --> 00:36:47,290
Do you think the data Carter found
in the shed is accurate?

698
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:49,545
You know I was there too, right?

699
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:52,825
Frank was close to figuring it out,
he just got the ratios wrong.

700
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:55,622
If he'd just told someone about this,
he might have made it through.

701
00:36:55,745 --> 00:36:58,440
People get used to working alone.
Makes it hard to trust.

702
00:37:00,309 --> 00:37:02,912
So if we're right, the skin should
absorb the reversal formula?

703
00:37:03,441 --> 00:37:05,921
And with any luck,
the radioactivity of Al-26.

704
00:37:06,113 --> 00:37:07,249
Let's do this.

705
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,091
Now you see it.

706
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,506
Zoe's car's back.
Completely normal after we applied

707
00:37:20,629 --> 00:37:23,332
the invisibility reversal formula
to its organic skin.

708
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,352
Yeah, guys, that's just great.

709
00:37:26,698 --> 00:37:28,479
But... How about me?

710
00:37:28,888 --> 00:37:30,356
Oh, god. My hands are shaking.

711
00:37:30,856 --> 00:37:32,608
Dr. Stark can do it if you'd like.

712
00:37:32,728 --> 00:37:35,569
No, thank you. I'm the one
who started working on invisibility.

713
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,002
I should be the one to finish it.

714
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,979
Guys?

715
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,479
It's not working.

716
00:37:58,696 --> 00:38:00,791
- We could try another piece.
- Wait.

717
00:38:02,249 --> 00:38:03,806
Radiation level's dropping.

718
00:38:04,587 --> 00:38:05,587
3%...

719
00:38:06,569 --> 00:38:07,893
- 5%.
- Watch.

720
00:38:08,729 --> 00:38:10,938
I'll be alive
but I'll still be invisible.

721
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:12,982
20%.

722
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:15,579
You're gonna be fine.

723
00:38:18,887 --> 00:38:20,030
You did it.

724
00:38:21,293 --> 00:38:22,550
We all did it.

725
00:38:23,862 --> 00:38:26,537
Could someone just finish doing it?

726
00:38:48,196 --> 00:38:49,999
Long night for everyone, I see.

727
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:53,124
Hey, Dad.

728
00:38:55,136 --> 00:38:56,650
Did you hear anything about my car?

729
00:38:57,261 --> 00:38:58,694
Well, we can see it again.

730
00:38:59,511 --> 00:39:01,822
I was afraid it was gone for good.

731
00:39:02,212 --> 00:39:03,574
You don't know the half of it.

732
00:39:04,536 --> 00:39:06,493
Do I even wanna know why he's in there?

733
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,414
No, not if you want a good night's sleep

734
00:39:09,565 --> 00:39:11,624
between now and her wedding.

735
00:39:13,413 --> 00:39:15,085
- What happened to Casper?
- Jasper.

736
00:39:17,049 --> 00:39:18,744
Rise and shine, lover boy.

737
00:39:19,236 --> 00:39:20,888
I don't know. I guess I just...

738
00:39:21,314 --> 00:39:22,790
Saw right through him.

739
00:39:27,176 --> 00:39:29,021
The ro-boxcar looks great.

740
00:39:29,738 --> 00:39:32,519
I'm guessing it's gonna be the only
thing I'm driving for a while, huh?

741
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:35,601
Well...

742
00:39:36,966 --> 00:39:38,470
You did break the rules.

743
00:39:38,989 --> 00:39:42,624
But I should've believed you
that the accident wasn't your fault.

744
00:39:42,748 --> 00:39:43,759
So...

745
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:46,033
So I can take my car out again?

746
00:39:46,235 --> 00:39:47,657
Oh, no, no.

747
00:39:47,904 --> 00:39:49,802
But you can still be my chauffeur.

748
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:53,888
I supposed we have to get this
to school, huh?

749
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:56,093
No, there's no hurry. We finished early.

750
00:39:58,931 --> 00:40:00,120
Impressive.

751
00:40:00,762 --> 00:40:01,839
Yeah.

752
00:40:02,115 --> 00:40:04,240
It's nice when you find someone you...

753
00:40:04,453 --> 00:40:05,546
click with.

754
00:40:11,404 --> 00:40:12,429
Yeah.

755
00:40:13,987 --> 00:40:15,296
Beverly, Beverly, Beverly.

756
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:17,398
She planted this near Kim's computer

757
00:40:17,518 --> 00:40:19,792
the day of the accident.
It's a recalibration device.

758
00:40:19,912 --> 00:40:21,944
It created false readouts as Kim began

759
00:40:22,156 --> 00:40:23,609
the extraction from the artifact.

760
00:40:23,746 --> 00:40:25,919
Which means someone was willing to kill

761
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:28,367
to keep us away from the artifact.

762
00:40:32,552 --> 00:40:34,370
I'm gonna trust you with this.

763
00:40:53,276 --> 00:40:55,811
- Check.
- Told you you'd be good at this.

764
00:40:55,931 --> 00:40:58,637
Hope you don't mind a shallow
hot girl wiping the floor with you.

765
00:40:58,775 --> 00:41:00,770
I've been waiting my whole life.

766
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:07,531
Check.

767
00:41:11,071 --> 00:41:12,669
- Sorry I'm late.
- Everything okay?

768
00:41:12,792 --> 00:41:14,951
Yeah. Just had to take care
of something at work.

769
00:41:15,074 --> 00:41:16,400
Nothing to worry about.

770
00:41:16,536 --> 00:41:17,725
I'll be right with you.

771
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:19,488
Nemo's birthday?

772
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:22,275
It's for the Sheriff.
His one-year anniversary in Eureka.

773
00:41:22,537 --> 00:41:24,245
He has a thing for shrimp.

774
00:41:24,997 --> 00:41:27,663
- How appropriate.
- I can't believe it's been a year.

775
00:41:27,783 --> 00:41:29,562
Yeah. Seems like 11.

776
00:41:30,506 --> 00:41:31,677
I didn't even remember.

777
00:41:32,911 --> 00:41:35,070
Well, you may have been thinking
about something else.

778
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,571
Or maybe I was thinking
about someone else.

779
00:41:42,983 --> 00:41:44,276
Thanks, Vince.

780
00:41:44,396 --> 00:41:46,534
- You are very welcome. Bon appetit.
- Thank you.

781
00:41:46,654 --> 00:41:49,079
- What is...
- Happy anniversary, Jack.

782
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:51,707
Thanks, Callie.

783
00:41:58,254 --> 00:41:59,541
This is really nice.

784
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:02,435
I don't know about you,
but I can't remember

785
00:42:02,558 --> 00:42:05,088
the last time that I had a good date.

786
00:42:07,164 --> 00:42:09,173
It's really nice to find someone you...

787
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,854
well, click with.

788
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:15,808
Crap!

789
00:42:15,928 --> 00:42:17,643
Okay, I am beginning to think

790
00:42:17,763 --> 00:42:19,587
that you are doing this on purpose.

791
00:42:21,475 --> 00:42:23,148
I'm beginning to think I should.

792
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,089
Cheers.
