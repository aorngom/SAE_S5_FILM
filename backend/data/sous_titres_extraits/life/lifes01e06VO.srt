Previously on Life

00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,780
Charlie saved my life in there. And
so now i handle his settlement money.


3
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:06,880
Charlie saved my life in there. And
so now i handle his settlement money.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,030
You were in for white collar crime?

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,180
Insider trading,yeah.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,570
You been working the program,dani?

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,189
Yeah. I've been working the program.

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,630
Do you want to know my name?

9
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,690
If i wanted to know your name,i
would have asked you for it.

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:31,700
Detective,i have something you might be
interested in-- The bank of los angeles shoot-Out.

11
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,870
That was 15 years ago.

12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,160
You should ask your partner.

13
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,060
What happened to all that money?

14
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,930
" Powerless "

15
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,240
Okay,listen up. This is
the "officer down" scenario.

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,030
Thanks to our so-Called consent decree,

17
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,330
some dirtbags will shoot it out with us
'cause they think we can't shoot back.

18
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,430
Nobody
wants it--

19
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,420
Dr. Detective.

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,970
Watching us do our homework?

21
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,450
Skipped a grade. Gotta re-Qualify.

22
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,190
You ain't riding with us,are ya?

23
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,779
Thought i would. Do you mind?

24
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,320
Oh,no problem at all. I
ain't riding in back though.

25
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,400
You're riding in the back,juarez.

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,660
Come on,bobby,you know what the perps
leave back there,all those fluids and stuff.

27
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,730
You're riding in the back,juarez.

28
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,350
All right,let's mount up.

29
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,300
* all the cool people
headin' west on wilshire.

30
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,590
That's my stop.

31
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,260
Mine too.

32
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,450
Mint?

33
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,190
Great minds think alike.

34
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,120
My name is rick,and i'm an alcoholic.

35
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,080
Dani.

36
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,370
It's good to meet you,dani.

37
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,440
Good to meet you,rick.

38
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,600
Come on,what's the deal? Let's go.

39
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,050
This is the "officer
down" scenario,juarez.

40
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,710
They gotta shoot somebody first.

41
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,230
You remember this?

42
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,520
Yeah,i remember this.

43
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,860
You two maybe want to get a room?

44
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,950
Do you know what i remember most?

45
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,600
It smells like piss back
here. And something else.

46
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,710
The boredom?

47
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,570
The burritos?

48
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,220
The stories,man. Your stories.

49
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,680
Hey,juarez,bobby ever tell
you about his pet turkey?

50
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,630
It drowned in the rain.

51
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,999
That turkey was.. The
world's dumbest bird.

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yuk it up,chuckleheads.

53
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,680
That bird was
d-U-M-B,stupid.

54
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,670
Hey,he ever tell you about the
bank of los angeles shoot-Out?

55
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,650
Yeah,only about a thousand times.
So many cops in the street..

56
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,690
All you could see was blue. He
fired his gun so many times..

57
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,090
The muzzle glowed red from the heat.

58
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,670
Like a hurricane of bullets.

59
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,670
And there he was.

60
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,750
Right in the middle of it.

61
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,050
Streets are full of
blood and bullet casings.

62
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,720
38 minutes in a nonstop,free-Fire zone.

63
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,840
Five dead. 18 million
in cash gone missing.

64
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,840
And you were right
there when it happened.

65
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,980
Yeah,i was right there when it happened.

69
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,270
I was doing pretty good.

70
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,210
Then i got to the end
of this rotten day.

71
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,300
And oh,my god,she wants me
to submit her expense report.

72
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,720
Of course i get a call from the babysitter that says
she has to go home early,and where is my husband?

73
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,510
Yeah,he forgot to charge his cell.

74
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,320
You know how that is,right?

75
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,810
I wasn't sure i was gonna make it.

76
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,350
I managed to tell myself that
this was just a situation...

77
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,210
...but there's a way through it.

78
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,810
I'm seven months sober today.

79
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,240
They're free.

80
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,140
The donuts.

81
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,340
I've seen you here before.
You're always in such a rush.

82
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,510
I'm lou.

83
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,550
Why don't you stick around?

84
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,840
Yeah,um,thanks. But i gotta get to work.

85
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,550
I'm rick.

86
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,970
And i am powerless.

87
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,140
I'm coming up on a year of sobriety.

88
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:13,990
And i'm here to humbly
ask you to help me.

89
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,190
It's not the first time
i've made 12 months.

90
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,220
I'm not a good guy when i drink.

91
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,070
I've hurt people.

92
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,310
Women.

93
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:36,350
About a year ago this
month,there was this,uh,one girl.

94
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,410
If i had been sober..

95
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,020
It got,uh,intense.

96
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,710
She coulda made a lot of trouble.

97
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,270
A lot.

98
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,870
She took back
what she,uh--

99
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,860
I guess she realized she
shouldn't have pushed me.

100
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:04,910
I'm telling you this because
you,all of you here,are my strength.

101
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:17,610
I gotta say hi to a friend of mine.

102
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,150
Hey. You waited. Great.

103
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,640
Wanna pick up where we left off?

104
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,950
Get to know each other?

105
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,140
You told quite a story in there.

106
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,010
And you didn't say a word.

107
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,610
What's with begging those
people to help you stay sober?

108
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,760
Oh,boy.

109
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,520
Listen,i slipped.

110
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,240
And i needed to say so in there.

111
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,810
Is that so awful?

112
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,120
That stuff about hurting women.

113
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,890
That's over.

114
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,490
What happened exactly?

115
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:00,310
Do you ever,uh,

116
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:07,120
have so much shame about something
that you can't even choke it out?

117
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,490
Dani,i know you understand this.

118
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,960
Give me a chance.

119
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,579
Maybe another time.

120
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,220
Can i call you?

121
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,690
Tell me your last name at least.

122
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,210
I'm a friend of bill.

123
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,410
Hey,how was your meeting?

124
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,670
Required by my employer.

125
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,310
Every moment you spend wishing you were
someplace else is a moment you can't get back.

126
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,870
What about every moment i spend
wishing you were someplace else?

127
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,590
It would hurt my feelings
if i thought you meant it.

128
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,630
Besides,those meetings do a lot of good.

129
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,730
I've seen guys get sober who were
as self-Aware as this piece of fruit.

130
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,430
Although it's not entirely
clear how aware fruit is.

131
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,450
You know plants
recognize their relatives?

132
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,060
Everything okay there?

133
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:07,640
I heard something.

134
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,740
I heard a guy confess to a rape.

135
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,830
I mean,he acted like he wanted help staying
sober,but he was drinking right before the meeting.

136
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,210
You saw him drinking?

137
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,600
Which means you were in a place
where there was drinking. Like a bar?

138
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,060
Focus on the words i'm
actually saying,okay?

139
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:29,570
This guy gets up and says he was hurtful to
a woman the last time he went out on a binge.

140
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,040
That was a year ago.

141
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,120
And he's drinking again.

142
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,290
"Hurtful" can mean a lot of things.

143
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,330
Yeah,but it means this thing.

144
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,050
He blamed the victim
for making him do it.

145
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,570
He said that he could get
into a lot of trouble for it.

146
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,160
And he stopped talking when he got
too close to saying what happened.

147
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,240
And he has a record.

148
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,540
I ran his plates.

149
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:53,320
Richard larson. Misdemeanor
sexual assault conviction in 2002.

150
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,530
I bet it was a plea bargain.

151
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,880
You can't push a misdemeanor to a felony jst
because you don't like what somebody said.

152
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,140
It's not about what i like.

153
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,250
It's like circumstantial evidence.

154
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,630
Is that what you think?

155
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,400
I'd like to welcome members of the
press to our fifth annual open house.

156
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,690
It is an honor to have you all here.

157
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,880
We have great progress to
report on community policing.

158
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:23,670
Compstat,our computer statistics program,has
reduced crime city wide by 15% this year.

159
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,869
-If you look here-
- Yeah,yeah,fine.

160
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,959
Great. I know that number.

161
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,050
Why aren't you people out on the street?

162
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,580
Numbers don't stop crime.

163
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,510
What news organization do you represent?

164
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:38,030
The people's news. I'm the stickler.

165
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,370
And this is tonight's webcast
from the stickler. Online now..

166
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:45,940
Lapd shills try again to trick
us with half-Truths and lies.

167
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,210
Lies,ma'am? Can we discuss
this ter the meeting?

168
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,880
Get her on camera,bud.

169
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,980
Action.

170
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,280
We'll need to discuss this later.

171
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,129
She's not kidding.

172
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:54,629
Cut.

173
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,850
No,not "cut. " Action.

174
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,750
Action.

175
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,170
Somebody is trying to
drive me out of my home.

176
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:04,590
There a guy who takes a dump on my lawn.

177
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,610
A couple of times a week
for the past three months.

178
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,520
He's after me.

179
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,440
I will contact animal control.

180
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,810
This is no dog.

181
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,730
How do you know?

182
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,200
Dogs don't eat corn!

183
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,560
We have a task force that's set
up for just this sort of problem.

184
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,070
Nobody believes in results
without seeing any,ma'am.

185
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:27,000
We will make sure you see results. Lieutenant
davis and i will take your case personally.

186
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,920
-Crews,not one more word.
-We promise.

187
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,960
We vow that we will catch your pooper.

188
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,980
And we will do it by
the end of the week.

189
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,870
Find me a report,and i'll
cover it here in sex crimes.

190
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,370
I don't know if there is one.

191
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,010
I'm looking for the victim now.

192
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,900
They usually look for us.

193
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,150
If you saw a crime about
to happen,what would you do?

194
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,430
But you said it already happened.

195
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,820
Well,it's about to happen again.

196
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,819
This guy stood up in
a.A. ,asked to be stopped.

197
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,530
I'm gonna stop him.

198
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:01,590
How come you're at a. A.
It was drugs,not alcohol.

199
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,830
It was a lot of things.

200
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,030
Uh-- No open cases
from last fall.

201
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,620
What about the dispatch reports?

202
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,210
Fall 2006,especially november.

203
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:21,260
There were five--
No,10,000 911 calls.

204
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,370
Yeah,okay. There you go. Be my guest.

205
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:33,440
Say,dani,um,can we just
have dinner or something?

206
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,610
It didn't end right with us.

207
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,090
But it ended.

208
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,760
* please,somebody has to pick
me up. Does it show my address?

209
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,010
Are you injured?

210
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:12,120
He locked me in my house,raped
me,he did things,did things to me.

211
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,200
We're on our way.

212
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,080
Do you know your attacker?

213
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,620
Rick larson. His name is rick larson.

214
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,990
Where's the arrest report?

215
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,950
There isn't one. She
withdrew the complaint.

216
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,990
You saw him drinking?

217
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,340
And you think he might
come after her again?

218
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,400
He might. Or he's after somebody else.

219
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,480
I can't find nancy,but
i can find larson.

220
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,940
Cash or credit?

221
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,950
It'll be,uh,credit.

222
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,280
Card and i.D.Please.

223
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:08,520
You know what,let's just,uh--
Let's just make it cash.

224
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,320
Are you a member of our book club?

225
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,260
No.

226
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:14,450
Then can i offer you membership in our
book club? 10% off today. 5% in the future.

228
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:19,350
Would you like me to recommend other books like
this book,that you mightnjoy if you enjoy this one?

229
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:23,270
Just this book,please.

230
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:35,700
Okay,uh,before we go on,i first want to
thank lois for bringing those lemon squares.

231
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:41,950
Oh,also remember that next week there's going
to be alternate side of the street parking.

232
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,430
Okay,that's that.

233
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,060
Anybody wanna share?

234
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,560
Hi.

235
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,380
I'm charlie,and i'm powerless.

236
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,520
Hate is a prison.

237
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,510
Anger is the warden.

238
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:12,230
And rage,rage is the guard who
takes a piece of you everyday.

239
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,170
You all know what it's like.

240
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,780
You fall,you hit the bottom.

241
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,930
The bottom breaks. You fall some more.

242
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,690
You get lost.

243
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,570
And now i tell myself it is what it is.

244
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:32,500
And i'm-- I'm
doing my best.

245
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,080
I hope.

246
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,680
Thanks.

247
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,400
-What was that?
-The truth.

248
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,660
I know where you're coming from.

249
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,770
How hate is a prison. It's
good to say it out loud.

250
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,300
It doesn't always help
saying it out loud,but..

251
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,910
Ain't that right,brother.

252
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,210
I was afraid you wouldn't
want to talk to me.

253
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,880
No,no,it was my fault.

254
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:05,380
I came to.. Make amends to you.

255
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:09,260
Why don't we all go out
for blended coffee drinks?

256
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,120
Dani and i actually have
a few things to talk about.

257
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,940
-Unless i'm intruding.
-No,no,you're not intruding.

258
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,760
So next time,charlie.
I want to hear more.

259
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,880
Let me get my coat.

260
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,250
What are you doing?

261
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:28,550
If this guy is who you say he is,i just--I
don't think you should deal with him alone.

262
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,190
You don't know what i can deal with.

263
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,470
Okay.

264
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,500
-Ready?
-Yeah.

265
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:42,440
Yesterday,the story about the
girl,what did she do to you?

266
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,840
Some women..

267
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,130
-Make me so mad that..
-That?

268
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,150
Only when i'm drinking.

269
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,150
You are drinking.

270
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,920
-You were at that bar.
-So were you.

271
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:01,060
Yo then you go to a meeting.
You know what that is?

272
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,930
That's a lie.

273
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,440
It is living a lie.

274
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,900
We're both liars,aren't we,dani?

275
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,850
It's the one thing i can always
be honest about-- I am a liar.

276
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,470
What can you be honest about?

277
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,370
I was a social drinker.

278
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,410
I did a little blow.

279
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,430
My boyfriend dumped me.

280
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,890
Lost a job.

281
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:32,200
And then i got it. You know?

282
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,090
It was time to clean up.

283
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,570
That's the whole story?

284
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,370
Yeah,that's the whole story.

285
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,620
Something wrong?

286
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,860
I don't think that's the whole story.

287
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,290
I know what you're doing.

288
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:01,030
You're messing with me.

289
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,470
You think you're different.

290
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,120
You're just like every other woman.

291
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,380
The only way to get larson off the
street is to get nancy to testify.

292
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,280
Well,let's talk to her.

293
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,839
We'd have to find her first.
Nancy wiscinski has vanished.

294
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:29,160
No obit,no missing person report,no
jane doe homicide around that time.

295
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,629
And she moved after the
rape,but no forwarding address.

296
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,080
She's 22 years old.

297
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,300
Aren't they all on myspace or
yourspace,facebook,faceplace?

298
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,510
How do you know about that?

299
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,940
Everybody knows about that.

300
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,580
Don't you want a whole
bunch of new friends?

301
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,800
Don't you want them all to
know where you are all the time?

302
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,520
PennyH238:Who's he talking bout? LUCKBOB231:Don't know
<<<HAPPYGIRL923 has joined the group>>> HAPPYGIRL923:Hi!

303
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,980
MANGOMAN:Have U see Nancy W?

304
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,720
HAPPYGIRL923: R U Cute?

305
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,490
MANGOMAN:Have U see Nancy Wiscinski?

306
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,330
PMJI. BUT IMHO,NRN,OM

307
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,930
Oh,no,where did you go?

308
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,500
Where did you go? Come on.

309
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:35,670
"Pardon my joining in,"but in my humble
opinion,"no response necessary,old man.

310
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,660
" I im'd a couple of
nancy's girlfriends.

311
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,320
You know,there's a whole new
language out there we don't even know.

312
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,590
So you got nothing?

313
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:45,860
Not from them.

314
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,270
But i found out that nancy's
screen name was cancelled.

315
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,700
Hmm,great.

316
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,750
Too bad people don't have g.P.S.

317
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,050
Computers do.

318
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,080
How's that work?

319
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:58,800
I find a friend in internet
crimes who'll run down the url.

320
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,040
If nancy didn't ditch her computer,it'll
take us right to her billing address.

321
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,190
I use my mom's maiden name now.

322
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,240
Because you're afraid
larson will find you?

323
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,790
No. I don't think about that.

324
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,100
It was just a way to move on.

325
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:16,770
It was nice of you to come by,but
i'd rather keep it in the past.

326
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:20,170
Well,we're here because
it won't stay in the past.

327
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,520
We think that your attacker is
about to go after someone else.

328
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,660
I can't help that.

329
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,220
I'm only asking you to
make a statement,nancy.

330
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,890
Well,i don't want to. I like where i am.

331
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,830
My job keeps me busy.
I like where i am now.

332
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,660
Good job?

333
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,880
What do you do?

334
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,560
Nancy does my books.

335
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,029
Oh,so you work at home. Must be nice.

336
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,410
Work your own hours?

337
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,080
I like it.

338
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,360
-Do you?
-Very much.

339
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,770
'Cause it seems to me,and i--
Look,i'm only just guessing here,

340
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,020
but it seems a lot like larson committed
the crime,but you went to prison.

341
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,450
I'm right,aren't i?

342
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:05,130
The wrong person's doing the time. You
put the right person away,you go free.

343
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,700
You don't understand.

344
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,820
It's his word against mine.

345
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,840
He's out there.

346
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,550
What if he found me like you did?

347
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,400
What am i supposed to do?

348
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,940
Testify.

349
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:24,520
Or wait until he dies.

350
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,920
That could be a long wait.

351
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,340
I'm sorry.

352
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,750
No eating in the car.

353
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,460
What? It's a stakeout.

354
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:52,400
No eating in the car.

355
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,540
I don't even let my
husband eat in the car.

356
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,170
You're married?

357
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,850
Why wouldn't i be
married? What'd you think?

358
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,260
You don't wear a ring.

359
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,590
Want to tell stories?

360
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,070
Do i want to tell stories?

361
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,280
Yeah,it's a stakeout.
We can't eat junk food.

362
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,690
At least let's swap stories.

363
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,439
You go first.

364
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,310
I'll go first. Okay.

365
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:27,980
Okay,so-- Okay,stakeout stories,usually--Usually
revolve around women. Okay?

366
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:32,870
Okay,who you would,you know,if
you could. You know,or cars?

367
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,990
Or sports?

368
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,360
Like,how 'bout those dodgers?

369
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,590
Is this what you and
detective reese talk about?

370
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:44,210
No,no,mostly we just talk about how
lucky we are to have you as a boss.

371
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:54,120
You know,back when i was a rookie,all we ever used to talk
about,stuck in that car,was the bank of l. A.Shoot-Out.

372
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,660
That was all anybody
talked about in those days.

373
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,480
Five perps dead. Not one cop shot.

374
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:04,710
And all that cash gone.
18 million missing.

375
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,900
The sixth man. You know?

376
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:09,579
I don't know. I guess i
just like conspiracies.

377
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,800
Conspiracies,detective,are
how bored people pass the time.

378
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:16,010
But come on,if there was no sixth
man,then who took all the money?

379
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,650
There was obviously someone
who got away with the cash.

380
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,830
Where's the conspiracy in that?

381
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,920
Whose side were they on,ours or theirs?

382
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:28,300
Like i said,conspiracies are
how bored people pass the time.

383
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:33,340
I never got halloween,dressing
up and begging for candy.

384
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,210
I think it's supposed to be fun.

385
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:42,480
But why beg for candy when you can
just go out and buy what you want?

386
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,470
I think it's supposed to be fun.

387
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,230
Drop it.

388
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,530
Drop the gun.

389
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,300
Nancy.

390
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,130
You bastard.

391
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,990
You have to die.

392
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,550
Drop the gun.

393
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,510
Look at me.

394
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,570
Remember me? You see me?
You see what you did to me?

395
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,410
Nabcy,drop the gun.

396
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:53,070
Drop the gun.

397
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,010
What are you doing?

398
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,520
What am i doing? What are you doing?

399
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,220
** what'd you think you were doing?

400
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,230
I can't live until he
dies. You told me that.

401
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:17,250
You said i would stay in
prison until he was dead.

402
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,490
Yeah,but he didn't mean you were
supposed to kill the guy yourself.

403
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:21,320
That's not what you meant. Tell
her that's not what you meant.

404
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,400
It's not what i meant.

405
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,990
Testify against larson.

406
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,440
I would lose.

407
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,700
The way he talks,he
knows things about people.

408
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,080
He said he was just like me.

409
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,860
That he used to drink. And he could
tell that i was drinking a lot too.

410
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:38,850
He swore he'd kill me if i told,and now
i've made him mad again. What am i gonna do?

411
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,730
You're gonna press charges.

412
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,240
I can't!

413
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,290
I died that day.

414
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,260
You didn't die.

415
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,250
You survived what happened to you.

416
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:50,370
You lived through that and here you are.

417
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:54,310
Did you ever think you could
live through such a thing?

418
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,240
There's real violence
in the world,nancy.

419
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,520
It never finds most people.

420
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,420
It found you.

421
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:11,520
But did you ever think you would have the
strength to survive what he did to you?

422
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,370
That's your secret,nancy.

423
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,460
Larson doesn't know it.

424
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,760
Larson doesn't know how strong you are.

425
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,400
Prison doesn't know
how strong he made you.

426
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,540
You said "prison.

427
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,250
" You mean "larson.

428
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:33,060
" He means larson is your prison.

429
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,830
I never did that.

430
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,340
I never did that either.

431
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,460
I might have done that.

432
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,510
I guess i..

433
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:50,810
Did that.

434
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,219
Oh,i definitely did that.

435
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,520
EARLEY WARNING***

436
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,600
Oh,my god.

437
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,880
His phone's disconnected.

438
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,750
I called larson's company.

439
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,390
He didn't show up today even
though he had a big meeting.

440
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:09,180
I asked when he'd be in,the guy
said he wasn't holding his breath.

441
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,500
When larson went on that bender
last year,he went awol for a month.

442
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,160
How'd you get him to tell
you all that on the phone?

443
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,740
Well,i asked. And i waited.

444
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,870
People like to fill a void.

445
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,320
No one knows where he is though.

446
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,320
There's a sundowner meeting
at a.A. I can ask there.

447
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:27,710
Uh-Uh,you mean we can ask there.

448
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,540
No,crs,this part's mine. Okay?

449
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:33,760
If i find him,i'll call you.

450
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:36,400
I can't believe this.

451
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:40,080
What,you came here to spy
on us,dani? How could you?

452
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:45,750
Lou,i came here because
i need to be here. Okay?

453
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:51,560
But right now,i need to question
rick larson about a rape.

454
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,320
I think you're wrong about rick.

455
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,050
Well,if i'm wrong,then he can
clear it up once i find him.

456
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:56,990
Where is he?

457
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,820
He hasn't called me.

458
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,490
Dani,he is doing great.

459
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,390
He's even sponsoring a new member.

460
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,120
I need to talk to that person.

461
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,950
You know it wouldn't be right
for me to give you her name.

462
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:10,710
Dani,i don't know why you
came here to begin with.

463
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:17,470
But what you're doing right now,how you're
going about it,seems very dangerous to me.

464
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,600
I haven't seen him.

465
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,580
Did he say he'd come?
I know you're friends.

466
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,850
We've talked.

467
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,320
He's a great person to talk to,isn't he?

468
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:30,990
I didn't know what would happen to me here,and he
could feel that. Without me even saying,he knew.

469
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,490
It's kind of getting to
be about more than a. A.

470
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,360
What do you mean?

471
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,980
I gotta go and change. But i'll tell
rick that you were looking for him.

472
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Are you meeting him?

473
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,510
At hunk on melrose.

474
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:44,360
Uh,i used to be afraid
to go where there's a bar.

475
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:47,730
But with him there,i'll be fine.

476
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,100
Bye.

477
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,220
The reason why the bank of l.
A.Shoot-Out is such good stakeout talk

478
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,780
is there were so many cops on
scene,there are so many different stories.

479
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:01,639
There aren't any different versions.
There is one version,the official version.

480
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,480
Really? Well,my old partner
bobby's version was pretty intense.

481
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,040
The street in front of the bank,a
sea of uniforms. All that noise.

482
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,940
How exactly would stark know about that?

483
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:14,820
He was there. Right in the middle of it.

484
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,470
Stark told you he was
in the middle of it?

485
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,580
Yeah. Why?

486
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,050
There's always that guy.

487
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,450
Which guy is that?

488
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:25,070
The one who wants to be there so badly
he changes the story to make it happen.

489
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:28,760
There were no uniforms in front
of the bank that day at all.

490
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,090
But all those rounds fired?

491
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,390
Over 1,100 rounds fired,but
they were all tactical.

492
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,680
Tactical?

493
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,780
Swat was on a training
exercise one block over.

494
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,550
They were there first.

495
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:41,290
That's why no civilians were killed.
That's why no police were shot.

496
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,020
That's why we study it.

497
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,690
But bobby
said--

498
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:46,510
I don't know what your old partner
told you,but if he was in uniform,

499
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:50,770
which he was,he was working
the barricades four blocks out.

500
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:15,100
Who is that?

501
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,730
Is that her cameraman?

502
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,810
Ugh!

503
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,540
It's you!

504
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,510
Why would you do this to me?

505
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,820
You order me around like a dog.

506
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,950
You treat everyone like a dog.

507
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,680
So poo on you.

508
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,660
Lieutenant,i gotta go.

509
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,740
Buy me a drink. Unless you're
waiting for someone else.

510
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,050
Love the one you're with.

511
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,840
You know that old song?

512
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,290
Are you happy to see me?

513
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:59,090
I feel so happy.

514
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,920
How do you feel?

515
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:10,430
I feel like this.

516
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,950
What's that?

517
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,550
It's her badge.

518
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,950
You're under arrest for
the rape of nancy wiscinski.

519
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,030
What?

520
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,310
That's insane.

521
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,140
Let go of me.

522
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,670
Everyone's watching.

523
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:27,280
Why not? It's a good show.

524
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:31,510
Stacey,it's a mistake.

525
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:43,000
My client is willing to
admit he knows the plaintiff.

526
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:47,760
They dated on and off before the
incident she calls a rape last year.

527
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:51,770
Why do you think she
is telling the truth?

528
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,050
I went out with that crazy girl.

529
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,949
I dumped her. She kept calling me.

530
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,950
And i got loaded 'cause
i felt guilty about her.

531
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,960
Okay. I'll take it from here.

532
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,790
No,no,no,don't.

533
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:07,100
I want to say this.

534
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:11,950
After she called me,like,uh,100
times,i went over there.

535
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:15,490
Drunk. We had sex.

536
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:21,400
And then i told her,"you got what
you wanted,so shove off. " Okay?

537
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:27,280
You can get up on that witness stand
and tell 'em exactly what i said.

538
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,390
You said more than you think.

539
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:32,070
Oh,what is wrong with you?

540
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:36,630
What kind of a bitch shows up
where a guy's trying to get right,

541
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:39,040
and sets him up to get
shot at and thrown in jail?

542
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:42,360
You're not going to
jail. You're going home.

543
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,910
He's not admitting to anything
more than consensual sex.

544
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,680
And i'm pretty sure that isn't a crime.

545
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:55,220
It is confusing. What to do?

546
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,140
I say we let the jury sort it out.

547
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,710
Now that's a good moment,isn't it?

548
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:13,730
It's very good moment.

549
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:17,290
Thank you both.

550
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,460
How's it going,winston?

551
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:34,200
Ted?

552
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,670
This is a surprise.

553
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,590
No,it isn't.

554
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:44,030
The surprise is when you walk by a
book store window and see your face.

555
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,720
I guess you read the book,huh?

556
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,210
"Earley warning"?

557
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:49,600
"Inside the mind of white collar trash"?

558
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,240
That last-- It
was my publisher's--

559
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,310
You were my partner,winston.

560
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:56,630
-Everything i did,you did.
-Yeah.

561
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,100
But you got caught.

562
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:02,690
What's with the mini-Bat,ted?

563
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,670
Oh,this.

564
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:08,710
You remember that baseball player
with the string of strip clubs?

565
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:12,220
He handed these out
when we took him public.

566
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:18,930
You know,i learned
something in prison,winston.

567
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,360
And i forgive you.

568
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:03,320
We're online now. Lapd shills try again
to trick us with half-Truths and lies.

569
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,600
Lies? Um..

570
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,540
Where's your partner?

571
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:10,420
She took off for the night. Why?

572
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,480
Larson made bail.

573
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:13,600
-When?
-A few hours ago.

574
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,820
I just got word.

575
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,880
Hi.

576
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,320
My name is rick.

577
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:43,450
And i'm powerless.

578
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:47,120
You're drunk.

579
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,900
Yup,i am.

580
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,100
But tomorrow,i'll be sober.

581
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,380
And you..

582
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,990
Well,i don't know.

583
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,640
What's the plan?

584
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,610
I want to get to know you.

585
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,840
What,you think i want to rape you?

586
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:08,760
Is that what you think?

587
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,320
You tell me.

588
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,330
Oh,you are so cool !

589
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,840
And full of crap.

590
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,640
Drink it.

591
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,280
You drink it.

592
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,520
All of it.

593
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,690
And another one.

594
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:56,550
Come on,drink.

595
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,640
Calling... Charlie Crews

596
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,550
Nancy wiscinski's at her mothes.

597
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:06,290
I'll send a unit over there to sit outside
just in case. Try reese on her cell.

598
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,950
She just called me.

599
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,240
Get me dispatch.

600
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:16,540
Reese?

601
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,160
Reese?

602
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,950
You know what's wrong with you?

603
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,300
The fact that some scumbag is sitting
in my kitchen with a gun to my head?

604
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:32,190
I know you got some piece
of crap story to tell.

605
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,000
Keep it on. Let's go.

606
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,270
You're not gonna tell
it to anybody,are you?

607
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:39,710
It's so precious and so special.

608
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,290
Th's what you think,right?

609
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:46,190
Is that what you think?

610
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,560
Sit down.

611
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:51,000
Yodon't get to call the shots,detective.

612
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,470
I call the shots.

613
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,660
You're not drinking.

614
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,080
I'm done.

615
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:04,610
You're done when i say you're done.

616
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,650
You're a big man with your gun out.

617
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:15,690
Go on,rick. Hit the jackpot.

618
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,020
Kill a cop. Be better than drinking.

619
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,510
Better than forcing those
girls to do what you need.

620
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,930
Come on,do it.

621
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,180
We can't get any line
of sight to the shooter.

622
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,740
They're still talking though.

623
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,910
Hey,got the officer
needs assistance call.

624
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:39,090
Thought you might want
some company on this one.

625
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,880
What is it u wanna do,rick?

626
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:44,280
You wanna know me?

627
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,400
Oh,i do.

628
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:49,720
I do know you.

629
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:51,100
You're in a world of pain.

630
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,610
You don't know pain.

631
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,070
-Finish it.
-All of it?

632
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:58,990
Yep,that's right. All of it.

633
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,500
Okay.

634
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,640
Give me a moment.

635
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:05,140
At?

636
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,980
Just--

637
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,750
Just give me a moment.

638
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:16,530
I can do what you want,but i just
need for you to give me a moment.

639
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,750
You understand?

640
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:21,240
That's not for him.

641
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:23,140
That's for me.

642
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,130
She just needs a moment.

643
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,370
You want to help me give her one?

644
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:30,440
Uh,i don't know what the hell what means.
But you're going there,i'm going there too.

645
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,220
Okay,moment's up.

646
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,630
Drink.

647
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:58,150
You want to know me?

648
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,960
You never shot up in a room
where a guy blew his head off,

649
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:05,480
and you're thinking you're lucky because
he didn't get his brains in your dope.

650
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,060
Or found yourself lying
in a pool of puke and crap.

651
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,250
Only you didn't care whose crap it was because
the whole time you're thinking,"you were so sick.

652
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:16,170
"All you wanted was to
get off and get well.

653
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,800
You knew that about me?

654
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,930
You think you hit bottom,rick?

655
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,460
You have no idea how far
down this goes,do you?

656
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:29,670
You think you're bad? You think
you got a demon inside of you?

657
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,700
You don't even know what that means.

658
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:39,790
You understand that,rick?

659
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:42,889
Want to tell me again about
the bank of l.A. ,bobby?

660
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,840
Like a hurricane of bullets

661
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,820
Streets full of blood d bullet casings.

662
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,460
What was that?

663
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,310
What was what?

664
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,460
18 million in cash gone missing.

665
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,270
And you were right
there when it happened.

666
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,910
Yeah,i was right there when it happened.

667
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,330
Who is that?

668
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,630
Code four. Suspect in custody.

669
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,510
Here.

670
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:19,420
He's all yours.

671
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:24,150
Hi. My name is charlie.

672
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,670
Say "hi,charlie.

673
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,440
Hate is a prison.

674
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,870
But you know what,rick?

675
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:31,600
Prison is a prison too.

676
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,600
Need some help?

677
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:44,290
Just--Just make
sure i don't fall.

678
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:49,390
All i needed was a moment.

679
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,790
That's,uh--

680
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,310
That's zen.

681
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,510
Isn't it,crews?

682
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,600
Isn't it?

683
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:10,170
That's zen.

684
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:14,290
I got it. I got it.

685
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,650
Isn't it?

686
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,580
That day..

687
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,280
Bank of los angeles shoot-Out?

688
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,800
I was on the barricade.

689
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:44,710
I-- I was on
the bricades.

690
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:54,410
Not tonight, don't worry Bobby. Tonight you were
right in the middle of it.

691
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,370
* hey.

692
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,710
I'm dani.

693
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,440
