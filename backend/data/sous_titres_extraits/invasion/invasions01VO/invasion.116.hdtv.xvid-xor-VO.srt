1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,700
Previously on "Invasion"...

2
00:00:00,701 --> 00:00:02,513
Tom is not who you think he is, Mariel.

3
00:00:02,524 --> 00:00:06,578
These creatures take people's D.N.A.
to create a new being, a like hybrid.

4
00:00:06,729 --> 00:00:08,169
I know you know what I am.

5
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,396
There's a guy named Szura.

6
00:00:09,397 --> 00:00:10,597
He's one of you.

7
00:00:10,819 --> 00:00:13,193
If these hybrids become the majority,
this is just the beginning.

8
00:00:13,194 --> 00:00:15,606
- How is it that you weren't taken?
- I got spit out.

9
00:00:15,607 --> 00:00:18,601
- I'm not a well man, Russell.
- They don't take you when you're sick.

10
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,499
You're on the islan of misfit toys, honey.

11
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,922
Once we go through basic training,
we're coming back with a vengeance.

12
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,283
I hate this place.
I'm gettin' out of here.

13
00:00:26,283 --> 00:00:29,524
You wanna know if there's something inside me
that's gonna hurt our kids.

14
00:00:29,524 --> 00:00:31,010
What is this big secret?

15
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:32,901
You all went into the water and came out different.

16
00:00:32,902 --> 00:00:34,305
You really wanna know what "different" means?

17
00:00:34,306 --> 00:00:36,666
Then stick with us.
We'll give you the whole show.

18
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:38,727
I think I'm pregnant, you son of a bitch!

19
00:00:38,728 --> 00:00:40,747
Everything in your body is completely different.

20
00:00:40,748 --> 00:00:41,601
It's not cancer.

21
00:00:41,602 --> 00:00:42,435
Those are eggs.

22
00:00:42,436 --> 00:00:44,607
It's like it's some kind of giant ovary.

23
00:00:44,608 --> 00:00:47,499
You can tell your daddy you're just like him now.

24
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,606
Oh, god.
Oh, god, Kira!

25
00:01:59,946 --> 00:02:00,948
Get her keys.

26
00:02:00,949 --> 00:02:03,551
We're just gonna grab some stuff
and then we're gone, all right?

27
00:02:09,873 --> 00:02:12,182
hey, hey, hey.
Come on.

28
00:02:16,596 --> 00:02:18,006
Army food. Yum.

29
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:20,222
- Which one's the key to the boat?
- The red one.

30
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,188
Let's get out of here
before I start puking again.

31
00:02:25,273 --> 00:02:27,990
Look, look, I won't tell anybody you were here.

32
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:30,312
Just take the boat and go. Please.

33
00:02:30,313 --> 00:02:32,015
Actually, we don't really need this.

34
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,540
I'm gonna find them.

35
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,881
The people who did this are not gonna get away.

36
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:52,453
Just tell me she's gonna be all right.

37
00:02:54,122 --> 00:02:56,245
She lost a lot of blood, but her pulse is strong.

38
00:02:56,246 --> 00:02:57,829
We just have to keep watching her.

39
00:02:58,934 --> 00:03:00,291
Bad heart valve.

40
00:03:02,061 --> 00:03:04,883
She's had it since she was born.
That's probably what saved her.

41
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,565
Those things in the water won't take you unless you're...

42
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:10,766
unless you're perfect?

43
00:03:16,505 --> 00:03:18,771
You have any idea where Derek and Christina are now?

44
00:03:18,772 --> 00:03:20,834
There are roadblocks everywhere.
They won't get far.

45
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,787
I don't understand what you were thinking, Tom.

46
00:03:24,391 --> 00:03:25,591
Sending them to an island?

47
00:03:25,686 --> 00:03:27,661
Christina Conrad's a murderer.
She should be in jail.

48
00:03:27,662 --> 00:03:29,802
If I'd have puher jail,
the whole world would've found out

49
00:03:29,803 --> 00:03:31,223
what she was and what we are.

50
00:03:31,376 --> 00:03:34,458
And I've worked too hard to protect us,
and I'm not gonna let some psycho girl

51
00:03:35,946 --> 00:03:37,146
and her boyfriend just...

52
00:03:42,057 --> 00:03:43,442
they're going back to that island.

53
00:03:46,406 --> 00:03:48,196
This time, they're gonna stay there.

54
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,623
Is is the M.R.I. we took of Mariel yesterday afternoon.

55
00:04:11,624 --> 00:04:13,459
At first, we thought that was a tumor.

56
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,607
But then we discovered it was filled with eggs.

57
00:04:15,809 --> 00:04:17,706
- Like an ovary?
- A third ovary.

58
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,691
With tubes running directly to her uterus.

59
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:20,923
Is she pregnant?

60
00:04:21,054 --> 00:04:22,685
No, but according to her blood work,

61
00:04:22,686 --> 00:04:24,731
that wasn't in her when she was changed.

62
00:04:25,414 --> 00:04:26,961
It's grown over the last few weeks.

63
00:04:28,179 --> 00:04:29,795
I mean, it just makes me wonder what else is coming.

64
00:04:30,097 --> 00:04:31,367
How many other women are like this now?

65
00:04:31,368 --> 00:04:33,825
I haven't heard of any hybrids giving birth.

66
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:38,849
What if the hybrids are just a bridge species?

67
00:04:39,421 --> 00:04:41,607
What if it's their offspring
we really have to worry about?

68
00:04:41,608 --> 00:04:43,491
Don't discount the hybrids, Russell.

69
00:04:43,723 --> 00:04:46,516
Szura's as dangerous as any creature
who's ever walked the planet.

70
00:04:46,678 --> 00:04:49,170
And yes, you should be concerned about these things breeding.

71
00:04:50,063 --> 00:04:55,580
But don't think that Szura, Underlay
or even Mariel aren't a threat.

72
00:04:56,012 --> 00:04:58,644
They're wired to survive at any cost,

73
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:02,272
and that cost will be us
if we don't do something to stop it.

74
00:05:05,558 --> 00:05:07,054
Are you any closer to finding Szura?

75
00:05:07,397 --> 00:05:10,140
No. But if I die before it happens,

76
00:05:11,388 --> 00:05:13,577
you'll kill him for me, won't you?

77
00:05:16,512 --> 00:05:17,712
I'm sorry, Healy.

78
00:05:21,084 --> 00:05:22,301
Alonzo.

79
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,660
Excuse me?

80
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,288
My real name's Alonzo.

81
00:05:31,675 --> 00:05:33,207
I figure if I can trust you with my life,

82
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,940
I can trust you with my real name.

83
00:05:38,989 --> 00:05:40,928
You mind if I still call you Healy?

84
00:05:45,531 --> 00:05:46,731
Yeah, go ahead.

85
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,047
<i>Russ?</i>

86
00:05:49,873 --> 00:05:51,073
Mona?

87
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:54,187
<i>Mona?</i>

88
00:05:59,237 --> 00:06:00,365
Russ?

89
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:02,349
I don't know how bad she is,
but I'm on my way to see her now

90
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,655
so I'm not gonna be able to make our meeting.

91
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:04,711
Do you want me to cancel?

92
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:06,580
No. No, Mariel's already cleared the time,

93
00:06:06,581 --> 00:06:08,691
and I'm sure the kids
are gonna have a thousand questions about Kira,

94
00:06:08,692 --> 00:06:10,343
so I just don't think we can wait.

95
00:06:10,615 --> 00:06:12,499
Just tell Jesse and Rose I'm really sorry
I couldn't be there

96
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,850
and I'll talk to them tonight, okay?

97
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:16,875
Okay. Russ... be careful.

98
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,560
I will.

99
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,014
Come on, kids.

100
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,407
We can get breakfast at the hospital.

101
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:26,074
- Hey, Larkin.
- Yeah?

102
00:06:26,075 --> 00:06:27,108
Do they know why Kira's in there?

103
00:06:27,109 --> 00:06:27,812
Larkin?

104
00:06:27,823 --> 00:06:28,466
Yeah?

105
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:30,007
Why is Kira in the hospital?

106
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:33,399
Well, you know, that's what your mom wants to talk to you about.

107
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,041
- Did she have an accident?
- You know, I don't have all the details.

108
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:37,242
Get up there.

109
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:39,117
Up you go.

110
00:06:39,345 --> 00:06:40,841
Let Jesse buckle you in, okay?

111
00:06:41,826 --> 00:06:43,026
You good?

112
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,624
So they're finally gonna do it, huh?

113
00:06:46,136 --> 00:06:49,547
- Mariel's gonna tell 'em that her and Tom are aliens?
- What?

114
00:06:49,548 --> 00:06:50,637
Dave...

115
00:06:50,638 --> 00:06:51,838
what?

116
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,060
Come on, let's go.

117
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:06,067
They took the skiff, first aid kit,
flashlights, M.R.E.S...

118
00:07:06,068 --> 00:07:08,211
I don't care about any of that stuff.
Let me see.

119
00:07:09,943 --> 00:07:11,143
You're gonna need stitches.

120
00:07:12,103 --> 00:07:12,941
You sure you're all right?

121
00:07:12,942 --> 00:07:14,142
I'll be fine.

122
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:16,066
Sorry.

123
00:07:16,424 --> 00:07:18,181
It was definitely that same girl, Russ.

124
00:07:19,498 --> 00:07:21,672
The one who dumped her baby
and killed her mother-in-law.

125
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:23,502
Underlay was supposed to have had her in custody.

126
00:07:23,503 --> 00:07:25,687
She's certainly not in custody anymore.

127
00:07:26,763 --> 00:07:28,480
And she's pregnant again.

128
00:07:29,747 --> 00:07:30,551
What?

129
00:07:30,552 --> 00:07:32,459
Yeah, she had to be at least five months.

130
00:07:33,697 --> 00:07:34,897
That's not possible.

131
00:07:35,243 --> 00:07:36,711
She wasn't even showing a few weeks ago.

132
00:07:40,552 --> 00:07:42,616
Why don't you stop talking about what you don't understand?

133
00:07:42,617 --> 00:07:45,340
You were supposed to have sent Christina Conrad to the F.B.I. In miami.

134
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:45,930
What happened?

135
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:47,339
Yeah, well, I guess she got away, huh?

136
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,684
- Oh, no kidding.
- Yeah, no kidding.

137
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:50,377
- I'll find her.
- Not in the park, you won't.

138
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,888
Dispatch, this is Varon.

139
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:55,219
- I need two law enforcements rangers to ranger station--
- I wouldn't do that, Russell.

140
00:07:57,229 --> 00:07:59,442
- She almost killed my friend.
- She almost killed my daughter.

141
00:07:59,443 --> 00:08:02,396
But if you call in the calvary,
Derek and Christina are gonna be exposed

142
00:08:02,397 --> 00:08:04,915
to a whole bunch of people that will not understand what they are...

143
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,770
let alone what that girl is carrying inside of her.

144
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:09,972
<i>Varon, you still there?</i>

145
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,173
Standby.

146
00:08:13,683 --> 00:08:14,887
Well, what is she carrying?

147
00:08:16,472 --> 00:08:18,260
Look, I know the park is your jurisdiction.

148
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:20,270
If you wanna take the lead on this, fine.

149
00:08:20,643 --> 00:08:22,746
But why don't we keep this between us and you work with me?

150
00:08:22,747 --> 00:08:23,429
I don't need your help.

151
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,051
No, but your kids need their mother.

152
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:28,213
You blow the whistle on this, you know what you're gonna get?

153
00:08:28,214 --> 00:08:30,820
Guys in white lab coats that are gonna take Mariel away.

154
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:35,101
Try having your kids forgive you for that.

155
00:08:38,147 --> 00:08:39,462
This boat's gonna make me throw up.

156
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:44,686
We should've taken her truck.

157
00:08:46,115 --> 00:08:48,490
I told you, Chris, the roads are all blocked off.

158
00:08:48,491 --> 00:08:49,385
We wouldn't have gotten anywhere.

159
00:08:49,386 --> 00:08:52,741
I hate you for doing this to me.
I didn't need to be pregnant again.

160
00:08:52,742 --> 00:08:54,444
Hey, I didn't do it on purpose.

161
00:08:55,027 --> 00:08:57,790
I don't even know how it happened. Okay?

162
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:00,768
I mean, we've only been together for a couple weeks,

163
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:02,723
and I mean, you're already so big.

164
00:09:04,182 --> 00:09:05,316
Where are we going?

165
00:09:05,317 --> 00:09:06,653
Camp my grandpa used to take me to.

166
00:09:07,578 --> 00:09:09,708
We're gonna hang out there for a while,
let things kinda cool down.

167
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,762
Camp?
Like, what, archery?

168
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:14,885
No, like an old hunting camp.

169
00:09:15,369 --> 00:09:16,187
Give you...

170
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,381
give you a chance to relax.

171
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:18,582
You've been acting...

172
00:09:19,215 --> 00:09:20,415
kind of crazy, chris.

173
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:25,381
What's wrong?

174
00:09:25,497 --> 00:09:26,822
I think we might be out of gas.

175
00:09:27,998 --> 00:09:29,198
Oh, great.

176
00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:43,009
Next time when I say, "let's take the truck,"
let's take the truck.

177
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,359
Okay.

178
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,750
What's wrong?

179
00:09:53,847 --> 00:09:55,047
Chris?

180
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,949
Whoa, whoa! Okay, okay.

181
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,150
Okay, sit back. Sit back,
sit back, sit back.

182
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:04,985
Is it happening again?

183
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,110
What?

184
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:34,170
Well, your dad wanted to be here,
but he got called away on an emergency,

185
00:10:34,171 --> 00:10:35,371
and Tom...

186
00:10:36,326 --> 00:10:38,870
is working as well.

187
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,475
Why does everyone have to be here?

188
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:43,536
Because we have something very important
we wanna discuss with you.

189
00:10:43,537 --> 00:10:45,310
Someone getting divorced again?

190
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,072
No.

191
00:10:48,073 --> 00:10:51,080
If that's what it is,
I'd really wish that you would just tell me.

192
00:10:51,081 --> 00:10:52,281
No, Jess.

193
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,779
Nobody's getting a divorce.

194
00:10:57,638 --> 00:10:58,838
This is about Kira...

195
00:11:00,923 --> 00:11:03,386
and... me and Tom.

196
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,787
And the whole town, really.

197
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,590
R ight.

198
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:13,886
What's wrong with the town?

199
00:11:14,782 --> 00:11:15,982
Well...

200
00:11:16,257 --> 00:11:19,331
um... you know about the lights in the water, right?

201
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:21,372
Well...

202
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:24,576
a lot of the people in the town have come in contact with them,

203
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:27,280
and it's made some of them...

204
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,289
different.

205
00:11:33,289 --> 00:11:34,384
Different how?

206
00:11:34,385 --> 00:11:37,107
Well, we're just beginning to figure that out.

207
00:11:38,424 --> 00:11:41,268
I want you to remember in everything you're about to hear, that...

208
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:47,980
I am still your mom, and Tom is still your stepdad.

209
00:11:51,266 --> 00:11:52,596
Do you remember the night of the hurricane

210
00:11:52,597 --> 00:11:53,898
when I didn't come home?

211
00:11:54,482 --> 00:11:56,551
Well, something happened that night,

212
00:11:56,944 --> 00:12:00,449
- and the next morning when you found me--
- Hold on.

213
00:12:04,048 --> 00:12:05,248
Are you aliens?

214
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,590
What?

215
00:12:08,943 --> 00:12:11,467
They said at the house that you were aliens.

216
00:12:11,468 --> 00:12:12,668
Mariel, we never said that.

217
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,738
I mean, the word may have been come out,
but it wasn't used in that--

218
00:12:15,739 --> 00:12:17,182
I just--I just meant that...

219
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:21,380
that you guys had changed, that's all. Like, uh...

220
00:12:21,804 --> 00:12:25,219
if they'd gone from being a caterpillar to a butterfly.

221
00:12:26,034 --> 00:12:27,234
Do you understand?

222
00:12:28,836 --> 00:12:31,160
Is this why Kira's here, 'cause she got abducted?

223
00:12:31,161 --> 00:12:34,737
No! Kira was attacked in the water.

224
00:12:34,738 --> 00:12:36,269
But she's fine, because...

225
00:12:37,406 --> 00:12:38,606
Kira's not...

226
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,625
like...

227
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,886
- What, she's not an alien?
- Oh, my god.

228
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,806
- Well, don't leave.
- Well, I am not an alien!

229
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:46,158
Then what are you?

230
00:12:46,822 --> 00:12:48,940
Because we've known you've been different for a long time.

231
00:12:50,448 --> 00:12:52,024
We just wanna know what you are.

232
00:12:57,683 --> 00:12:59,371
Not a butterfly.

233
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:36,749
It's out of gas.

234
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,156
We should be able to catch up to 'em.

235
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:42,679
Hey, Russ. Um...

236
00:13:42,896 --> 00:13:45,914
you relying on some old indian
tracker broken twig thing here,

237
00:13:45,915 --> 00:13:48,030
or do you actually know where you're going?

238
00:13:48,237 --> 00:13:51,089
To avoid your roadblocks.
We should stay near the shore.

239
00:13:52,447 --> 00:13:53,104
All right.

240
00:13:53,105 --> 00:13:55,165
They could also be heading up north to big cypress trail,

241
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,631
but without backup, we'll never know.

242
00:13:58,206 --> 00:13:59,500
Ah, we don't need backup.

243
00:13:59,913 --> 00:14:01,511
Yeah. You got everything under control.

244
00:14:07,058 --> 00:14:08,414
How far is this place?

245
00:14:08,796 --> 00:14:11,448
Um, I don't know.
Maybe like 4 or 5 miles.

246
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,570
- Do you still feeling bad ?
- I don't want to talk about it.

247
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,070
All right.

248
00:14:16,849 --> 00:14:18,286
I've never seen a baby move like that.

249
00:14:19,131 --> 00:14:20,296
He's okay, right?

250
00:14:20,297 --> 00:14:21,623
- He?
- Or she.

251
00:14:22,015 --> 00:14:23,827
I mean, it's obviously going pretty fast.

252
00:14:23,828 --> 00:14:25,761
So it's all right, right?

253
00:14:26,104 --> 00:14:27,304
I have no idea.

254
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:30,595
What do you want to call it?
- What?

255
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:33,469
The baby. Have you thought about a name for it yet?

256
00:14:36,366 --> 00:14:37,566
Are you insane?

257
00:14:37,881 --> 00:14:39,624
Have you not heard a word I have said to you

258
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,226
since the day that we met?

259
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,196
Yeah--

260
00:14:42,197 --> 00:14:46,159
I got married when I was 16 because I was pregnant.

261
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,721
The kid's now living with my grandparents.

262
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,627
The next kid--

263
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:52,978
you gave away because you lost your husband in the hurricane.

264
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:53,782
That's okay, I under--

265
00:14:53,783 --> 00:14:55,636
because I felt like a prisoner.

266
00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:59,013
Because I felt like a prisoner my entire life.

267
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,232
I don't wanna be a prisoner anymore, Derek.

268
00:15:01,787 --> 00:15:02,544
Do you understand that?

269
00:15:02,545 --> 00:15:03,774
That's why we got off the island.

270
00:15:04,951 --> 00:15:06,638
That's why we got away from Szura, okay?

271
00:15:09,212 --> 00:15:10,200
I'm not going back.

272
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,401
Okay.

273
00:15:22,877 --> 00:15:24,077
What was that?

274
00:15:30,523 --> 00:15:31,723
Derek?

275
00:15:34,311 --> 00:15:35,511
Derek?

276
00:15:47,434 --> 00:15:48,634
Want a little decaf?

277
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:52,462
Come on,
I said I was sorry.

278
00:15:52,463 --> 00:15:54,542
I'll be lucky if Mariel ever talks to me again.

279
00:15:54,543 --> 00:15:56,175
Oh, give me a break.
She'll talk to you again.

280
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:57,845
Listen, the kids are just--

281
00:15:57,846 --> 00:15:59,441
they're still scared because there's no logical explanation

282
00:15:59,442 --> 00:16:00,245
for what happened here.

283
00:16:00,246 --> 00:16:02,420
Aliens or not, there's just too many holes, all right?

284
00:16:02,842 --> 00:16:04,857
Well, I'd love to fill them, but Russell made me promise

285
00:16:04,858 --> 00:16:06,058
to stay away from the story.

286
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:08,046
Larkin, the hell with the story.

287
00:16:09,183 --> 00:16:11,780
Why can't you and I both go out like a couple of concerned citizens

288
00:16:11,781 --> 00:16:12,981
and find out the truth?

289
00:16:13,876 --> 00:16:15,096
Give Mariel some real answers.

290
00:16:15,097 --> 00:16:16,301
She'll forgive us both in a heartbeat.

291
00:16:16,302 --> 00:16:18,577
Because the only people with real answers are the military.

292
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:20,202
And according to your friend mr. Healy,

293
00:16:20,203 --> 00:16:21,887
they're just sitting back and watching it happen.

294
00:16:21,888 --> 00:16:23,088
But why?

295
00:16:24,145 --> 00:16:26,054
Why? Why are they just sitting back and letting it happen?

296
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:28,671
What's in it for them?

297
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:30,258
How high does this thing go?

298
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:32,158
Who's involved? Don't these questions drive you insane?

299
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,359
Of course, but...

300
00:16:33,632 --> 00:16:35,514
what you're talking about is a conspiracy story.

301
00:16:35,515 --> 00:16:36,715
No!

302
00:16:38,726 --> 00:16:40,176
When was the last time you talked to your buddy at the air base?

303
00:16:40,177 --> 00:16:41,810
- Vince?
- Yeah.

304
00:16:42,162 --> 00:16:42,416
I don't know.

305
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:43,826
Oh, come on.
He's gotta know something.

306
00:16:43,827 --> 00:16:45,017
I doubt it.

307
00:16:45,018 --> 00:16:46,385
He's the facilities manager.

308
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,174
Oh, so he's just in charge of the buildings?

309
00:16:49,701 --> 00:16:50,750
He's just in charge of the buildings

310
00:16:50,751 --> 00:16:54,905
Where all the top secret junk goes on. Shoot.

311
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,139
It's a food packet--M.R.E.

312
00:17:13,054 --> 00:17:14,254
That come from your place?

313
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:15,933
I think so.

314
00:17:25,927 --> 00:17:27,127
What?

315
00:17:41,953 --> 00:17:43,153
esta bien. Okay?

316
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:44,230
Esta bien.

317
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:44,941
Easy.

318
00:17:44,942 --> 00:17:46,313
No somos la migra.

319
00:17:46,888 --> 00:17:48,088
Okay?

320
00:17:49,238 --> 00:17:50,438
¿De donde eres?

321
00:17:52,051 --> 00:17:53,251
Honduras.

322
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:57,019
Somos trabajadores en las granjas del sur.

323
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,340
They're migrant workers.

324
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:00,578
Whs "they"?

325
00:18:09,918 --> 00:18:11,118
esta bien.

326
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:26,602
he said the hurricane destroyed their housing,

327
00:18:26,603 --> 00:18:29,129
and the other workers won't let them live in their new camp.

328
00:18:30,467 --> 00:18:31,667
What other workers?

329
00:18:32,637 --> 00:18:34,093
¿Donde esta el campamento?

330
00:20:39,507 --> 00:20:41,426
- hey.
- Hey.

331
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,300
- How you feeling?
- Okay.

332
00:20:52,933 --> 00:20:57,649
- Am I changed?
- No, sweetie.

333
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,850
But that's a good thing.

334
00:21:05,403 --> 00:21:06,603
Hey, guys.

335
00:21:14,637 --> 00:21:17,681
He's mad at you for not telling us about mommy.

336
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,887
They know about you?

337
00:21:25,981 --> 00:21:27,931
Did you tell them because of me?

338
00:21:28,243 --> 00:21:29,443
No.

339
00:21:30,272 --> 00:21:32,613
I told them because of me, but...

340
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,415
it came out the wrong way.

341
00:21:39,848 --> 00:21:41,958
Why wasn't I changed, Mariel?

342
00:21:44,431 --> 00:21:47,042
Your father's gonna talk to you about that
when he gets back.

343
00:21:49,706 --> 00:21:52,152
- You want some water?
- Okay.

344
00:22:03,391 --> 00:22:06,979
Our family is never going to be the same again, is it?

345
00:22:18,926 --> 00:22:19,940
Larkin?

346
00:22:19,941 --> 00:22:22,869
Vince. I really appreciate you seeing me on such short notice.

347
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:23,503
Who are you ?

348
00:22:23,504 --> 00:22:26,068
what--I'm, uh, I'm her brother.
I'm Dave. Dave groves.

349
00:22:26,442 --> 00:22:27,421
I was hoping we'd be alone.

350
00:22:27,422 --> 00:22:28,857
It's okay. He's here to help with--

351
00:22:28,858 --> 00:22:29,968
No, it's not.

352
00:22:29,969 --> 00:22:31,837
Vince, wait. What's wrong?

353
00:22:35,206 --> 00:22:36,406
Right after you called me,

354
00:22:36,801 --> 00:22:38,590
I got dragged into the wing commander's office.

355
00:22:39,164 --> 00:22:41,042
Did something happen last time you were on the base?

356
00:22:43,786 --> 00:22:47,718
Look, Vince, I'm a reporter, and sometimes...

357
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:48,230
No, no, no.

358
00:22:48,231 --> 00:22:50,577
No, that does not give you the right
to take advantage of a friend.

359
00:22:51,494 --> 00:22:52,465
You used me.

360
00:22:52,466 --> 00:22:53,666
You used me to get on the base.

361
00:22:54,245 --> 00:22:55,234
What were you hoping to find?

362
00:22:55,235 --> 00:22:56,354
Hey, hey, man.

363
00:22:56,355 --> 00:22:57,183
Why don't we all sit down?

364
00:22:57,184 --> 00:22:59,453
I put a high premium on character,
and if you had just come out

365
00:22:59,454 --> 00:23:01,369
and said you were doing a story
about corruption in the military--

366
00:23:01,591 --> 00:23:02,078
corruption?

367
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:04,554
They said that you were trying to prove that
we're overcharging washington

368
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,493
for paper clips and pencils and whatever--

369
00:23:07,494 --> 00:23:08,750
that we're crooks.

370
00:23:08,751 --> 00:23:09,951
That's insane.

371
00:23:10,031 --> 00:23:12,703
That's more than insane.
They lied to him.

372
00:23:13,589 --> 00:23:14,789
They lied to you.

373
00:23:15,949 --> 00:23:17,149
Lo--

374
00:23:17,377 --> 00:23:20,340
Will you please come sit with us?

375
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,475
I have to go.

376
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,429
Hey, I'm sorry.

377
00:23:24,724 --> 00:23:26,389
Can I ask you one question?

378
00:23:27,124 --> 00:23:28,946
If we can prove to you that your bosses lied,

379
00:23:28,947 --> 00:23:30,871
will you stay and help us out?

380
00:23:31,162 --> 00:23:32,362
Why would they lie?

381
00:23:33,042 --> 00:23:34,362
I did go somewhere I shouldn't have.

382
00:23:34,363 --> 00:23:36,825
That hangar that you told me was run by special ops?

383
00:23:36,826 --> 00:23:39,431
I peeked in there, and I saw about a hundred titanium boxes--

384
00:23:40,116 --> 00:23:41,888
boxes that I'd seen earlier at a crash site

385
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:43,517
for a downed helicopter in the glades.

386
00:23:43,518 --> 00:23:44,430
Yeah, a member of that crew,

387
00:23:44,431 --> 00:23:46,507
lieutenant Paxton, ended up in this hospital,

388
00:23:46,878 --> 00:23:48,108
but before anybody could actually talk to the guy,

389
00:23:48,109 --> 00:23:50,148
the air force just swept in and took his body away.

390
00:23:50,149 --> 00:23:51,218
Was he dead?

391
00:23:51,219 --> 00:23:53,328
We're not sure, but he may have been taken to your base.

392
00:23:54,425 --> 00:23:55,896
We think that the crew of that helicopter

393
00:23:55,897 --> 00:23:58,452
may have actually encountered something in the water--

394
00:24:00,262 --> 00:24:01,462
something that...

395
00:24:02,615 --> 00:24:03,815
may be...

396
00:24:05,356 --> 00:24:06,885
extraterrestrial.

397
00:24:25,956 --> 00:24:27,156
mi familia...

398
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:28,583
estan en nueva york.

399
00:24:32,087 --> 00:24:33,287
Tom.

400
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:38,741
What did they say about Derek and Christina?

401
00:24:38,742 --> 00:24:40,385
He claims that they haven't seen them.

402
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,460
What about these guys?

403
00:24:42,586 --> 00:24:44,672
I don't speak spanish well enough to understand
what they were sayin.

404
00:24:45,367 --> 00:24:46,567
They're hybrids, aren't they?

405
00:25:14,536 --> 00:25:15,736
Where did you get these?

406
00:25:18,105 --> 00:25:20,114
¿La comida--de donde salio?

407
00:25:25,639 --> 00:25:26,885
Fue un regalo.

408
00:25:28,113 --> 00:25:29,313
He said it was a gift.

409
00:25:30,341 --> 00:25:31,541
A gift from who?

410
00:25:31,911 --> 00:25:33,406
¿Un regalo de quien?

411
00:25:42,343 --> 00:25:43,968
Where did the food come from ?

412
00:25:44,812 --> 00:25:47,214
We didn't give it to them.
They took it !

413
00:25:47,377 --> 00:25:48,631
But where did you get it ?

414
00:25:53,254 --> 00:25:54,454
From the man.

415
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:57,946
What man... the young man with the girl I asked about ?

416
00:25:59,484 --> 00:26:01,185
Why didn't you tell me this before ?

417
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:02,750
Because I was afraid, you...

418
00:26:03,231 --> 00:26:04,431
were like them.

419
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,070
What do you mean ?

420
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:32,357
Who is he ?

421
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,743
He's my brother.

422
00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:48,267
He was starving. He asked them for a piece of fish.

423
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,147
But they wouldn't give it to him.
So he took it.

424
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:54,257
He only took a little bit.

425
00:26:59,042 --> 00:27:00,277
And they killed him.

426
00:27:03,713 --> 00:27:05,621
The all killed him !

427
00:27:12,575 --> 00:27:15,901
They got them to give us some food.

428
00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:25,819
where's the coroner?

429
00:27:28,682 --> 00:27:30,501
We're still waiting on social services out here, deputy.

430
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,330
Do you have an E.T.A.?

431
00:27:33,176 --> 00:27:35,195
<i>he left over an hour ago.
He should be there any minute.</i>

432
00:27:35,898 --> 00:27:36,306
Thank you.

433
00:27:36,307 --> 00:27:37,762
This is bigger than an immigration problem.

434
00:27:37,763 --> 00:27:38,982
Why didn't you call the coroner?

435
00:27:39,103 --> 00:27:40,449
Social services can handle it.

436
00:27:40,944 --> 00:27:43,238
Did you ask them which direction
Derek and Christina were heading?

437
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:45,700
- South, along the water.
- All right, good.

438
00:27:45,701 --> 00:27:47,268
This detour hasn't been a total waste.

439
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:49,092
No, actually,
it's been very educational.

440
00:27:50,881 --> 00:27:52,430
This isn't my vision of the future.

441
00:27:52,431 --> 00:27:53,792
Then what are you doing to stop it?

442
00:28:16,182 --> 00:28:17,458
Sheriff?

443
00:28:19,929 --> 00:28:21,839
Andy Dennison, social services.

444
00:28:22,211 --> 00:28:23,411
Sorry I'm late.

445
00:28:23,427 --> 00:28:24,604
These guys need help right here.

446
00:28:24,605 --> 00:28:26,680
I've got a transpo on the way out here now.

447
00:28:27,234 --> 00:28:28,051
How many are there?

448
00:28:28,052 --> 00:28:29,252
Eight.

449
00:28:29,335 --> 00:28:30,535
There were nine.

450
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,240
Oh, god.

451
00:28:33,775 --> 00:28:34,975
That was his brother.

452
00:28:35,935 --> 00:28:36,965
He's got family in new york.

453
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:38,322
He was hoping you could get a message to them.

454
00:28:38,323 --> 00:28:38,914
Of course.

455
00:28:38,915 --> 00:28:40,185
As soon as we reach town.

456
00:28:41,362 --> 00:28:44,084
Cuando lleguemos a miami, puedo llamar a su familia, bueno?

457
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:46,641
Gracias, seÑor.

458
00:28:46,777 --> 00:28:48,410
Si. Thank you.

459
00:28:48,411 --> 00:28:49,611
What happened to them?

460
00:28:50,867 --> 00:28:52,067
Ask them.

461
00:29:08,804 --> 00:29:10,672
I'm sorry this place is such a mess.

462
00:29:11,247 --> 00:29:12,447
It's all right.

463
00:29:15,134 --> 00:29:16,334
Do you want a beer?

464
00:29:16,993 --> 00:29:18,193
Actually, I would.

465
00:29:20,016 --> 00:29:21,216
Okay.

466
00:29:24,247 --> 00:29:25,447
There you go.

467
00:29:30,015 --> 00:29:31,215
Might wanna go easy on that.

468
00:29:32,227 --> 00:29:34,417
Pregnant women aren't supposed to drink, are they?

469
00:29:35,211 --> 00:29:37,470
Wouldn't want little Derek getting toasty.

470
00:29:40,587 --> 00:29:41,786
What's in the first aid kit?

471
00:29:41,787 --> 00:29:45,042
Ah, just some tape, bandages, aspirin, stuff like that.

472
00:29:45,043 --> 00:29:46,243
Take it all.

473
00:29:46,646 --> 00:29:47,846
Is there a closet in here?

474
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:50,519
No.

475
00:29:51,237 --> 00:29:52,095
There's a gun closet.

476
00:29:52,096 --> 00:29:53,296
Open it.

477
00:29:53,469 --> 00:29:55,085
Uh, I don't think there's any guns in there.

478
00:30:05,867 --> 00:30:07,068
Sorry, honey, the cupboard is bare.

479
00:30:07,069 --> 00:30:07,901
What are those sticks?

480
00:30:07,902 --> 00:30:10,429
These? These are cleaning rods for the rifles.

481
00:30:10,832 --> 00:30:12,032
Let me see one.

482
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:20,000
It's not very sharp.
A hanger would be better.

483
00:30:20,001 --> 00:30:21,201
You got one?

484
00:30:21,576 --> 00:30:23,724
No. For what?

485
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:30,239
Christina, what--

486
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,440
what are you thinking?

487
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:36,696
I'm not having this baby, Derek.

488
00:30:37,471 --> 00:30:38,671
Well...

489
00:30:40,736 --> 00:30:42,454
don't I have some sort of say about all this?

490
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,900
No.

491
00:30:50,031 --> 00:30:50,898
I'm not gonna let you do this.

492
00:30:50,899 --> 00:30:52,300
You don't have a choice.

493
00:30:55,056 --> 00:30:56,256
Is there alcohol in here?

494
00:30:57,478 --> 00:30:58,678
No.

495
00:30:58,864 --> 00:31:00,064
Oh, well.

496
00:31:13,674 --> 00:31:14,874
Chris, don't do this.

497
00:31:15,392 --> 00:31:16,592
Christina, don't.

498
00:31:17,844 --> 00:31:19,044
Don't do this.

499
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:22,506
Chris, don't do this.

500
00:31:24,365 --> 00:31:28,192
- God! Ow! God!
- What's wrong?

501
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:30,530
What's happening?

502
00:31:32,032 --> 00:31:34,683
My insides feel like they're being torn apart.

503
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,167
- Did you--did you hurt it?
- No! I didn't touch it!

504
00:31:38,168 --> 00:31:40,473
Ow, god! Ow!

505
00:31:58,436 --> 00:31:59,957
We may have to call this off until tomorrow.

506
00:31:59,958 --> 00:32:01,093
I don't have any place to go.

507
00:32:01,094 --> 00:32:04,119
Well, I have two kids who I haven't seen since this morning,

508
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:07,086
and I'm sure after talking to Mariel,
they're gonna need some support.

509
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:11,688
Boy, that must be tough on the back,
carrying all that selflessness around.

510
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:15,009
Wh, do you think you're so different than me
or those guys back there?

511
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:16,210
You're not.

512
00:32:19,045 --> 00:32:20,913
That's the thing I never understand about people.

513
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:23,932
They're always so astonished when one person kills another,

514
00:32:23,933 --> 00:32:25,605
but it's in our nature.

515
00:32:27,705 --> 00:32:29,810
You think we're descended from the three guys sitting in the cave,

516
00:32:29,811 --> 00:32:31,192
sharing their buffalo?

517
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,197
No. We're descended from the fourth guy that says,

518
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:35,658
"hey, why don't I pick up this club

519
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:37,075
and smack these other three losers,

520
00:32:37,076 --> 00:32:38,689
and then there'll be more meat from me?"

521
00:32:38,951 --> 00:32:40,151
That's our ancestor.

522
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,190
That's survival.

523
00:32:43,352 --> 00:32:44,829
Survival's
what it's all about.

524
00:32:49,109 --> 00:32:50,309
Hey.

525
00:33:09,016 --> 00:33:10,216
Okay.

526
00:33:16,803 --> 00:33:18,003
All right.

527
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,550
Who's hungry?

528
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,470
Oh, come on.

529
00:33:25,223 --> 00:33:26,453
They're supposed to start school again tomorrow.

530
00:33:26,454 --> 00:33:27,714
I wonder how that's gonna go.

531
00:33:55,017 --> 00:33:56,271
I'm sorry if I scared you.

532
00:33:56,796 --> 00:33:58,447
You could've... called or--

533
00:33:58,448 --> 00:34:00,030
I wasn't sure that was a good idea.

534
00:34:00,683 --> 00:34:01,883
Do you have something for me?

535
00:34:04,252 --> 00:34:05,452
Vince, it's okay.

536
00:34:05,871 --> 00:34:06,625
I love my country,

537
00:34:06,626 --> 00:34:08,742
Sure Larkin, and when I think there may be people--

538
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:11,897
people that I work with, that I can't trust anymore...

539
00:34:13,314 --> 00:34:14,514
What have you found out?

540
00:34:16,007 --> 00:34:17,207
When I went back to the base,

541
00:34:17,917 --> 00:34:19,624
I talked to the wing commander again.

542
00:34:20,638 --> 00:34:22,095
I told him that I'd seen you

543
00:34:23,804 --> 00:34:26,136
and that I confronted you about the corruption story.

544
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:31,201
And then I told him that you agreed to kill it.

545
00:34:32,747 --> 00:34:35,086
But I was never working on a corruption story.

546
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,700
I know.

547
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:39,771
And I could tell by his reaction, he knew it, too.

548
00:34:42,262 --> 00:34:43,760
You were right about Paxton.

549
00:34:44,706 --> 00:34:45,875
He was processed onto our base

550
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,694
the same night they took him from the hospital.

551
00:34:47,695 --> 00:34:49,778
- Was he alive?
- I-I don't know.

552
00:34:51,286 --> 00:34:52,733
But they took him to hangar 42.

553
00:34:53,496 --> 00:34:55,351
That's the same one that you looked in.

554
00:34:55,352 --> 00:34:57,173
I don't know what they're doing in there,

555
00:34:57,868 --> 00:35:01,033
but you might be able to find out with this.

556
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:06,419
That is an access code for the base's backup computer servers.

557
00:35:06,952 --> 00:35:09,985
All of our operations keep copies of their files on it.

558
00:35:11,112 --> 00:35:12,312
You didn't get it from me.

559
00:35:24,011 --> 00:35:25,478
I can go in by myself.

560
00:35:26,704 --> 00:35:27,904
That's okay.

561
00:36:14,262 --> 00:36:15,462
Christina?

562
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:18,325
Christina.

563
00:36:37,588 --> 00:36:39,083
You got an E.T.A. On the ranger?

564
00:36:39,818 --> 00:36:41,566
<i>He's en route.
He should be there by now.</i>

565
00:36:42,296 --> 00:36:43,204
You know, she may need an ambulance.

566
00:36:43,205 --> 00:36:45,219
No, no. She won't need an ambulance. She's fine.

567
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:47,043
You're fine, right?

568
00:36:47,044 --> 00:36:48,520
Are you gonna tell us where your buddy is?

569
00:36:48,521 --> 00:36:49,533
I have no idea.

570
00:36:49,534 --> 00:36:50,986
When was the last time you saw him?

571
00:37:00,153 --> 00:37:01,940
You have not been a very good girl.

572
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,049
What did you do with Derek, Christina?

573
00:37:05,628 --> 00:37:06,828
Christina?

574
00:37:09,939 --> 00:37:11,139
Jesus!

575
00:37:13,335 --> 00:37:14,535
Get up.

576
00:37:16,993 --> 00:37:18,710
No, no. Get up.

577
00:37:19,444 --> 00:37:20,644
Get up.

578
00:37:21,884 --> 00:37:23,131
No. Let her go.

579
00:37:23,996 --> 00:37:25,702
Let her go, or I will kill him!

580
00:37:46,031 --> 00:37:47,654
Okay. Okay.

581
00:37:47,655 --> 00:37:48,855
Okay.

582
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:52,722
Okay.

583
00:37:54,938 --> 00:37:56,138
You see, honey?

584
00:37:56,194 --> 00:37:57,394
I'm a good provider.

585
00:37:58,324 --> 00:38:01,484
Well, fellas, I-I'd love to stay and hang out, have a couple beers,

586
00:38:01,485 --> 00:38:03,659
but, uh, I got a family to think about now.

587
00:38:04,485 --> 00:38:05,685
Right, mama?

588
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:22,571
Everything always leads back to Underlay.

589
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,047
Like, that's the wreckage from his plane righthere.

590
00:38:27,063 --> 00:38:29,775
These pictures are from that hangar in 1996.

591
00:38:30,689 --> 00:38:32,889
All types of top military brass
were investigating this plane crash,

592
00:38:33,866 --> 00:38:35,713
including a certain former intelligence officer.

593
00:38:38,347 --> 00:38:39,843
I'll give you 10 bucks if you can guess his name.

594
00:38:41,914 --> 00:38:42,531
Szura.

595
00:38:42,532 --> 00:38:45,521
Eli Szura. The guy was all over this thing. Look.

596
00:38:45,932 --> 00:38:47,248
He's in a lot of other pictus, too.

597
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:48,692
His name's everywhere.

598
00:38:49,914 --> 00:38:51,114
Wait a minute.

599
00:38:51,351 --> 00:38:52,551
That's Szura?

600
00:38:52,676 --> 00:38:53,876
Yeah.

601
00:38:54,868 --> 00:38:56,068
What is it, Russ?

602
00:38:58,352 --> 00:38:59,552
That son of a bitch.

603
00:39:03,337 --> 00:39:04,537
Mr. Szura?

604
00:39:07,848 --> 00:39:09,048
I'm really sorry.

605
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,886
I didn't mean for anything like this to happen.

606
00:39:13,897 --> 00:39:14,574
He killed someone.

607
00:39:14,575 --> 00:39:18,760
Someone? A park ranger, and that's a real problem.

608
00:39:20,246 --> 00:39:21,446
What about Christina?

609
00:39:22,539 --> 00:39:23,739
We'll find her.

610
00:39:24,057 --> 00:39:25,257
Derek will help us.

611
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:33,937
Szura?

612
00:39:36,717 --> 00:39:37,917
Don't lose anymore.

613
00:40:09,696 --> 00:40:10,896
Healy!

614
00:40:11,112 --> 00:40:12,312
Healy, we found him!

615
00:40:13,152 --> 00:40:14,352
We found Szura.

616
00:40:16,257 --> 00:40:17,457
Healy?
