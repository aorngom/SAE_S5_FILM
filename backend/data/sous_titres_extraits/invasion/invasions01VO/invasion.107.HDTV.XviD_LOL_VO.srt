00:00:02,046 --> 00:00:04,100
<i>Why don't you just go home
and worry about your new husband</i>

3
00:00:04,101 --> 00:00:05,599
<i>and leave us alone ?</i>

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,178
<i>- Now I want you to be here.
- I don't wanna be here tonight.</i>

5
00:00:09,479 --> 00:00:11,079
<i>- Jesse !
- What ? !</i>

6
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,789
<i>- Everything all right with the baby ?
- Yeah.</i>

7
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,313
<i>I wanna find out why the air force is down here</i>

8
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:15,925
<i>and if there's a cover-up, who's involved.</i>

9
00:00:15,926 --> 00:00:17,059
<i>You really wanna push this thing ?</i>

10
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,002
<i>According to my contact
They were after a missing weather plane.</i>

11
00:00:20,003 --> 00:00:21,971
<i>I'm here to see master sergeant Vince Teracoma.</i>

12
00:00:22,172 --> 00:00:24,536
<i>Hey, you wouldn't know anything
about a downed helicopter</i>

13
00:00:24,537 --> 00:00:26,095

17
00:01:24,355 --> 00:01:26,474
Oh, we were so close, Russ.

18
00:01:26,675 --> 00:01:28,365
We had the thing in our net.

19
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:31,209
- But we lost it.
- Yeah, but it was one of them.

20
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,410
You danced with a real live extraterrestrial, my man.

21
00:01:34,758 --> 00:01:35,823
He danced with a fish.

22
00:01:35,824 --> 00:01:38,290
Hey, Russell, it's Scott. Are you there ?

23
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:41,644
Hey, Scotty. What's up ?

24
00:01:41,845 --> 00:01:44,040
- Have you seen Larkin ?
- Yeah, she radioed about an hour ago.

25
00:01:44,241 --> 00:01:46,441
She said she's heading over
to nine mile pond for a story.

26
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:49,524
Yeah, that's where I am,
but she's not here.

27
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,807
Well, you check with the station ?

28
00:01:52,008 --> 00:01:53,364
No one's heard from her,
and Val was kinda pissed

29
00:01:53,565 --> 00:01:54,517
'cause she missed a live shot.

30
00:01:55,318 --> 00:01:56,412
All right. Well, let me see
if I can ge a hold of her.

31
00:01:56,613 --> 00:01:57,517
I'll call you back.

32
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,918
- Where the hell's nine mile pond ?
- It's way south in the glades.

33
00:02:00,573 --> 00:02:01,852
Well, maybe she hit some bad road.

34
00:02:28,195 --> 00:02:29,695
<i>Honey ?</i>

35
00:02:32,343 --> 00:02:33,717
<i>Larkin, you there ?</i>

36
00:02:38,013 --> 00:02:40,213
<i>Honey, please come in.</i>

37
00:02:40,485 --> 00:02:42,622
<i>Honey, if you can hear this, call me.</i>

38
00:02:42,823 --> 00:02:45,023
- Hey, could she be out of range ?
- Maybe.

39
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:47,392
'Cause she's, like, the queen of on time.
You know that.

40
00:02:47,393 --> 00:02:49,193
She's never late.

41
00:02:50,251 --> 00:02:52,276
You wanna go look for her, dad ?

42
00:02:55,097 --> 00:02:56,611
Yeah, you know what ?
Maybe I'll take a ride down there.

43
00:02:56,812 --> 00:02:57,991
Yeah, I'll go with you.

44
00:02:58,492 --> 00:03:00,346
Jess, you mind stayin' here just in case she shows ?

45
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:01,968
- Sure.
- Thanks, man.

46
00:04:16,793 --> 00:04:17,890
<i>No, I haven't heard anything, Russ,</i>

47
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,140
<i>and I've been on the scanners all morning,</i>

48
00:04:19,341 --> 00:04:21,074
<i>but I'll check with my dispatch for you.</i>

49
00:04:21,475 --> 00:04:22,190
Thanks, Tom.

50
00:04:22,191 --> 00:04:23,542
I know you got your own folks down there,

51
00:04:23,643 --> 00:04:25,843
but if you need any helpfinding her--anything...

52
00:04:26,804 --> 00:04:27,631
<i>I appreciate it.</i>

53
00:04:27,832 --> 00:04:28,696
<i>I'm sure she's just stuck somewhere.</i>

54
00:04:28,897 --> 00:04:31,327
<i>Most of these roads still haven't been cleared since the hurricane.</i>

55
00:04:32,428 --> 00:04:34,043
All right. You let me know
if anything changes.

56
00:04:34,044 --> 00:04:35,387
Jesse's at your house ?

57
00:04:35,588 --> 00:04:36,188
<i>Yeah, </i>

58
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,174
and I know Mariel needs to get to work.

59
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,575
So if she wants to drop Rose back at our house with Jess...

60
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,070
<i>I'll take care of it.
Just go find your wife.</i>

61
00:04:43,308 --> 00:04:44,391
Thanks.

62
00:04:57,942 --> 00:05:00,142
You know, uh, you might not wanna hear this,

63
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:02,394
but did you know that Larkin thought she was followed

64
00:05:02,595 --> 00:05:04,795
the other day after she left that air force base ?

65
00:05:06,085 --> 00:05:06,909
No.

66
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,276
I figured she didn't tell you.
She told me.

67
00:05:08,477 --> 00:05:09,726
Why would anyone have been following her ?

68
00:05:09,927 --> 00:05:10,912
'Cause she was snoopin' around.

69
00:05:11,113 --> 00:05:12,054
You know,I know you wanna believe

70
00:05:12,255 --> 00:05:13,729
the military has nothing better to do than to worry

71
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,088
- about my wife and her little news station.
- Hey, it's my sister.

72
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:17,839
You know when she gets her handson a story, she doesn't let up.

73
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,402
- Well, there's no military conspiracy.
- Russell.

74
00:05:21,703 --> 00:05:22,874
You don't think they have better things to do ?

75
00:05:23,075 --> 00:05:24,301
Isn't there a war going on ?

76
00:05:24,502 --> 00:05:26,354
<i>Hey, Russell, Scott again.
Are you there ?</i>

77
00:05:26,555 --> 00:05:27,916
Yeah, Scott, any sign of her ?

78
00:05:28,117 --> 00:05:29,286
<i>No, man, I'm takin' it pretty slow.</i>

79
00:05:29,487 --> 00:05:31,227
I went as far south as I could from nine mile.

80
00:05:31,428 --> 00:05:32,597
I didn't see her.

81
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:33,853
<i>So I'm--I'm gonna head back, okay ?</i>

82
00:05:34,054 --> 00:05:36,416
<i>But listen, I told a couple fishermen to keep an eye out for her.</i>

83
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:39,406
Thanks. Keep me posted, will you ?

84
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:40,249
<i>You got it.</i>

85
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,250
Larkin ?

86
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,270
<i>Honey, you there ?</i>

87
00:05:49,617 --> 00:05:51,205
<i>Larkin, it's Russell.
Can you hear me ?</i>

88
00:05:51,406 --> 00:05:53,606
I'm here ! I'm here !

89
00:05:54,258 --> 00:05:55,905
<i>Come on, honey,
where are you ?</i>

90
00:06:01,755 --> 00:06:03,236
<i>you there, honey ?
Pick up.</i>

91
00:06:03,437 --> 00:06:04,511
<i>Larkin, where are you ?</i>

92
00:06:34,016 --> 00:06:35,688
- Hey.
- Hey.

93
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:38,089
- What are you guys doin' here ?
- Well, your dad called.

94
00:06:38,552 --> 00:06:39,835
He thought you might want some company.

95
00:06:40,036 --> 00:06:43,164
- Don't you have to work today ?
- Yeah, but I can go in later.

96
00:06:44,565 --> 00:06:46,765
- Have you had breakfast ?
- No.

97
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:47,961
Would you like some ?

98
00:06:48,862 --> 00:06:50,384
We brought you some eggs, Jess.

99
00:06:50,585 --> 00:06:51,447
Mom made 'em.

100
00:06:52,648 --> 00:06:54,463
Yeah, come on.
I haven't eaten yet, either.

101
00:07:36,662 --> 00:07:37,921
What ? What is it ?
What is it ?

102
00:07:40,622 --> 00:07:42,222
Dave ! Get on the radio now !

103
00:07:43,513 --> 00:07:44,206
Larkin !

104
00:07:44,807 --> 00:07:45,554
Larkin !

105
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:05,416
Russ, Tom's here.

106
00:08:09,977 --> 00:08:12,317
- Anything ?
- She's not in the car.

107
00:08:18,037 --> 00:08:19,739
Let me get the divers down here.

108
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,687
Just to be sure.

109
00:08:22,188 --> 00:08:24,188
Yeah, yeah, sure.

110
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:27,084
I gotta go look for her.

111
00:08:27,285 --> 00:08:28,376
- Where ?
- Anywhere.

112
00:08:28,577 --> 00:08:30,643
She's pregnant, Tom.
She could be hurt.

113
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:31,741
Larkin !

114
00:08:33,242 --> 00:08:34,114
Larkin !

115
00:08:51,356 --> 00:08:52,592
Hello ? Hello ?

116
00:08:56,383 --> 00:08:56,877
Hello ?

117
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:00,833
Hello ?

118
00:09:14,258 --> 00:09:17,210
Place mats. Place mats.
Here they are.

119
00:09:18,711 --> 00:09:19,599
Thanks, mom.

120
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,391
- Jess, you wanna help us set the table ?
- We don't need to set the table.

121
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:28,345
- Would you rather eat at the counter ?
- No, mom. I want us to all eat together.

122
00:09:29,746 --> 00:09:31,123
Come on, Jess. Help us.

123
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,960
It's still kinda your kitchen. Right, mom ?

124
00:09:51,361 --> 00:09:52,346
No, Rosie.

125
00:09:52,547 --> 00:09:56,142
- It was when you lived here.
- Yeah, but I don't live here anymore.

126
00:09:56,543 --> 00:09:58,168
But it's still kinda yours.

127
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:02,209
Yours is kinda dad's.
'Cause you share.

128
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,160
- You guys using this hot plate, Jess ?
- Yeah.

129
00:10:10,603 --> 00:10:13,093
- Will you turn on the generator for me ?
- I can eat my eggs cold.

130
00:10:14,294 --> 00:10:15,301
I'll turn it on.

131
00:10:16,402 --> 00:10:18,809
- You don't know where it is.
- Which is why you're gonna show me.

132
00:10:23,477 --> 00:10:25,167
- Why are you being such a jerk ?
- I'm not.

133
00:10:25,368 --> 00:10:26,858
Your mom's here because she's concerned about you,

134
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,259
- and you're treating her like garbage.
- I don't want her here.

135
00:10:29,476 --> 00:10:31,126
- Well, that's obvious.
- Larkin's missing,

136
00:10:31,327 --> 00:10:33,082
and all of a sudden,she wants to be my mom ?

137
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:35,483
- She always wants to be your mom.
- She didn't when she lived here.

138
00:10:36,182 --> 00:10:40,077
Dad builds most of this place for her
and she moves us out by the time Rose is 1.

139
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:44,178
- That has nothing to do with you.
- No, it had to do with you...

140
00:10:44,665 --> 00:10:46,865
- and your dad.
- What ?

141
00:10:47,976 --> 00:10:48,916
Nothin'.

142
00:10:49,117 --> 00:10:50,666
No, wait a second.

143
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:53,067
You think it's my dad's fault that your parents got divorced ?

144
00:10:53,335 --> 00:10:54,395
I don't know.

145
00:10:54,596 --> 00:10:56,146
Why don't you ask him about it ?

146
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:05,925
- I had no idea you were this angry.
- I'm not angry, all right ?I just...

147
00:11:06,426 --> 00:11:08,626
I don't feel like playing house with her today.

148
00:11:09,354 --> 00:11:12,365
It just feels like she's taking advantage
of the whole situation, trying to...

149
00:11:13,766 --> 00:11:14,714
win me over or something.

150
00:11:14,915 --> 00:11:17,115
Why does she have to win you over, Jess ?

151
00:11:17,962 --> 00:11:20,053
What has she ever done to you that's so horrible ?

152
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,366
Here's the generator.

153
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:42,951
If she did get out of the car, Russell,
why wouldn't she wait close by ?

154
00:11:42,987 --> 00:11:44,307
Maybe 'cause she couldn't wait.

155
00:11:44,508 --> 00:11:46,096
- Why couldn't she wait ?
- She's pregnant, Dave.

156
00:11:46,297 --> 00:11:47,803
Even if she isn't hurt,she'd want to get to a hospital

157
00:11:48,004 --> 00:11:48,908
and make sure the baby's okay.

158
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:51,265
Okay, but what road would she take, Russ ?

159
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:53,666
There's, like, 8 million acres out here.

160
00:11:54,475 --> 00:11:55,275
What are you lookin' at ?

161
00:11:57,477 --> 00:11:59,557
What, are you lookin' at tracks ?
Those are tracks ?

162
00:11:59,758 --> 00:12:00,566
Yeah.

163
00:12:01,967 --> 00:12:02,713
How long you been tracking her for ?

164
00:12:02,914 --> 00:12:04,120
I picked 'em up about 50 yards back.

165
00:12:04,321 --> 00:12:05,830
So that's good. That means--footprints is good.

166
00:12:06,031 --> 00:12:07,131
That means she's okay, right ?

167
00:12:08,885 --> 00:12:10,185
It means she got out of the car.

168
00:12:12,309 --> 00:12:13,929
Larkin. Larkin !

169
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:24,207
Come on ! Gosh.

170
00:14:45,471 --> 00:14:47,181
How far could she have gotten ?

171
00:14:47,382 --> 00:14:48,051
Shouldn't we have found her by now ?

172
00:14:48,252 --> 00:14:50,306
She's out here somewhere.

173
00:14:51,907 --> 00:14:52,960
Larkin !

174
00:14:57,801 --> 00:14:58,822
Maybe she's hiding.

175
00:14:59,323 --> 00:15:00,923
Why would she do that ?

176
00:15:02,477 --> 00:15:03,989
To torture me.

177
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,390
She used to do it all the time when we were kids.

178
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,398
About a quarter mile from our old house,

179
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:10,799
there was this grove of mulberry trees...

180
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:13,359
and Larkin would just disappear in these things for hours.

181
00:15:13,828 --> 00:15:16,028
My mom would send me to go get her for dinner

182
00:15:16,302 --> 00:15:18,502
and she'd hide and then she'd attack me.

183
00:15:18,868 --> 00:15:19,845
She'd just be...

184
00:15:20,046 --> 00:15:21,633
sittin' upin one of these trees

185
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:23,911
eatin' these berries,
and she would attack me.

186
00:15:24,112 --> 00:15:25,749
She would just pelt me with the things.

187
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:26,586
It was like--

188
00:15:26,787 --> 00:15:28,612
it was like mulberry paintball.

189
00:15:28,813 --> 00:15:31,028
I'd be purple from head to toe.

190
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,702
You should plant a mulberry tree, Russ.

191
00:15:40,144 --> 00:15:41,710
Never lose her again.

192
00:15:50,064 --> 00:15:50,698
Hey.

193
00:15:56,828 --> 00:15:57,440
Oh, god.

194
00:15:59,371 --> 00:16:00,221
Oh, man.

195
00:16:04,665 --> 00:16:06,490
Larkin !

196
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:09,527
Larkin !

197
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:37,746
Hey !

198
00:16:40,284 --> 00:16:42,358
Hey, wait ! Stop ! Stop !

199
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:43,356
Stop !

200
00:16:44,257 --> 00:16:45,268
Stop ! Wait !

201
00:16:45,469 --> 00:16:47,643
Wait ! Stop !

202
00:16:52,281 --> 00:16:53,081
Thank you.

203
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,137
Thank you. Um, I need a ride.

204
00:16:57,338 --> 00:17:00,338
I've been in an accident. Please.
You have got to help me.

205
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,813
I have to get to a hospital.
I'm pregnant.

206
00:17:02,014 --> 00:17:04,214
- I'm sorry.
- No. No !

207
00:17:05,553 --> 00:17:08,153
I'm sorry. I don't care what you're doing.

208
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,945
But whatever it is,it's not as important as this.

209
00:17:11,146 --> 00:17:12,546
Drive.

210
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,810
Please.

211
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:40,446
- Wh-what's that smell ?
- Fish.

212
00:17:42,905 --> 00:17:45,129
- You're a fisherman ?
- I'm a lot of thing.

213
00:17:52,691 --> 00:17:54,047
I can take you no further than the main road.

214
00:17:54,248 --> 00:17:56,448
After that, you have to find someone else.

215
00:17:56,998 --> 00:17:58,660
Sir...

216
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:00,215
please...

217
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,779
- I'm worried about my baby.
- I understand.

218
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,083
You--

219
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,222
look, once you get to the main road,

220
00:18:06,423 --> 00:18:08,202
the hospital is just a few miles.

221
00:18:08,403 --> 00:18:11,609
I can take you no further than the main road.

222
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:20,680
We're about a mile and a half from you back on a paved road.

223
00:18:20,881 --> 00:18:23,326
Her tracks end here. I think she may have gotten a ride.

224
00:18:24,727 --> 00:18:25,601
Well, that's good.

225
00:18:25,802 --> 00:18:27,424
<i>Yeah, look, we also found a hurricane victim</i>

226
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:30,106
<i>just east of you in a station wagon.</i>

227
00:18:31,507 --> 00:18:33,097
Copy that. Are you gonna stay on foot ?

228
00:18:33,298 --> 00:18:34,385
<i>Well, I'm having my truck brought to me now.</i>

229
00:18:34,586 --> 00:18:36,399
In about 10 miles, this road's gonna lead out of the park.

230
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,491
So if you could have a deputy and an E.M.T. On the other end,

231
00:18:38,692 --> 00:18:40,786
<i>we could have her covered from both sides.</i>

232
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:41,853
You got it.

233
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,254
<i>Thanks, Tom.</i>

234
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,201
- This is really good, Mariel.
- Thank you.

235
00:18:56,597 --> 00:18:57,297
Jesse ?

236
00:18:59,527 --> 00:19:00,070
Very good.

237
00:19:01,771 --> 00:19:05,210
Can we call daddy, mom,
to see if he's found Larkin yet ?

238
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:07,412
That's a great idea.

239
00:19:14,477 --> 00:19:15,741
Russell ?

240
00:19:16,842 --> 00:19:17,595
Mariel, is that you ?

241
00:19:17,796 --> 00:19:19,345
<i>yeah, I'm here with the kids.</i>

242
00:19:19,546 --> 00:19:21,063
- Where ?
- At your house.

243
00:19:21,264 --> 00:19:23,464
<i>We were wondering if there's any word on Larkin yet.</i>

244
00:19:24,011 --> 00:19:25,311
No, I think we're getting close.

245
00:19:25,912 --> 00:19:27,234
Well...

246
00:19:27,435 --> 00:19:29,024
- That's great.
- What are you doin' at the house ?

247
00:19:29,225 --> 00:19:32,225
Well, I brought Rose over,
and Kira's here and Jesse

248
00:19:32,302 --> 00:19:34,356
and we're all eating breakfast together.

249
00:19:34,557 --> 00:19:35,384
You don't mind, do you ?

250
00:19:35,585 --> 00:19:38,285
I-I just thought until you guys got back

251
00:19:38,328 --> 00:19:42,530
that--that they might need me.

252
00:19:43,931 --> 00:19:45,140
Jesse.

253
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,452
Do you mind ?

254
00:19:51,653 --> 00:19:54,553
Uh, no. Uh, actually,I appreciate it, thanks.

255
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,750
<i>Keep us posted, okay ?</i>

256
00:19:55,951 --> 00:19:56,875
Yeah, will do.

257
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,508
I can talk to him.

258
00:20:05,601 --> 00:20:08,705
No, you know what ? I--I'd better go talk to him.

259
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:15,830
Boy or girl ?

260
00:20:18,231 --> 00:20:18,991
Wh--what ?

261
00:20:19,192 --> 00:20:20,298
Are you having a boy or girl ?

262
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:25,199
I don't know.

263
00:20:26,043 --> 00:20:27,595
Better that way for the surprise.

264
00:20:27,796 --> 00:20:29,996
My wife,she had a difficult time.

265
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:32,471
My boy, he's 9 now.
He's very strong.

266
00:20:33,503 --> 00:20:34,893
You have a name for the child ?

267
00:20:37,573 --> 00:20:39,473
No.

268
00:20:42,024 --> 00:20:44,968
But my husband's cuban...

269
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:50,182
so maybe a cuban name if we--
aah !

270
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,801
What--what ? What is it ?What is it ?

271
00:20:57,518 --> 00:20:59,102
What is it ?
Okay, okay, we stop here.

272
00:20:59,303 --> 00:21:01,157
Please, no, I have to get to a hospital.

273
00:21:01,358 --> 00:21:03,023
We--we stop here.They may have a bathroom.

274
00:21:03,224 --> 00:21:04,392
- Aah ! Oh !
- You are sick.

275
00:21:04,593 --> 00:21:05,608
You must rest.

276
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,457
Please don't leave me.

277
00:22:20,802 --> 00:22:21,402
Excuse me.

278
00:22:21,489 --> 00:22:22,618
Uh, have you seen a car pass by here

279
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:24,292
in the last five, ten minutes,or a truck, maybe ?

280
00:22:24,493 --> 00:22:26,693
We're lookin' for a woman, brunette, about 5'5".

281
00:22:27,123 --> 00:22:27,983
She--she may have been on foot.

282
00:22:28,184 --> 00:22:30,384
We think she got a ride from someone, though.

283
00:22:30,587 --> 00:22:33,387
I did see a car with a woman and a man.

284
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:34,761
I believe the woman had brown hair.

285
00:22:34,962 --> 00:22:37,162
- What type of car ?
- I don't know. 4-door.

286
00:22:38,084 --> 00:22:38,684
Blue sedan.

287
00:22:38,772 --> 00:22:40,972
- Yeah ? How long ago ?
- Just a few minutes.

288
00:22:41,676 --> 00:22:42,877
Thank you. Thank you very much.

289
00:22:43,078 --> 00:22:44,782
Hey, you want us to,uh, radio in the tow ?

290
00:22:44,983 --> 00:22:48,407
- No, thanks. I almost have it fixed.
- All right, thanks, bud.

291
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:12,092
- W-were you talking to someone ?
- No.

292
00:23:12,293 --> 00:23:14,393
But I thought I heard a car.

293
00:23:14,881 --> 00:23:15,581
I wish.

294
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:22,279
- What ?
- The truck. It won't start.

295
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,942
I'm afraid we're stuck here.

296
00:23:35,258 --> 00:23:37,458
- Jesse, open up.
- I don't wanna talk.

297
00:23:37,835 --> 00:23:40,035
- Well, we have to.
- No, we don't.

298
00:23:40,315 --> 00:23:41,997
If you don't want me here, I understand,

299
00:23:41,998 --> 00:23:45,120
but I'm not leaving until we talk.

300
00:23:56,121 --> 00:23:57,621
Thank you.

301
00:24:02,405 --> 00:24:07,247
Jesse, I came here because I was worried about you

302
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:09,680
and I miss you...

303
00:24:12,681 --> 00:24:17,647
and if anything happened to Larkin,
I didn't want you to be alone.

304
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:30,489
Your room's changed a lot.

305
00:24:31,712 --> 00:24:32,312
It looks pretty cool.

306
00:24:32,321 --> 00:24:33,694
Yeah, well, I'm not 7 anymore.

307
00:24:44,388 --> 00:24:45,593
That's a pretty nice view.

308
00:24:50,518 --> 00:24:51,824
You keep these doors open a lot ?

309
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:53,025
Yeah.

310
00:24:59,043 --> 00:24:59,843
Jesse.

311
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,120
I love you.

312
00:25:05,858 --> 00:25:09,358
Just tell me what I can do to take this pain away,

313
00:25:09,433 --> 00:25:10,650
and I will.

314
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,165
Will you tell me the truth ?

315
00:25:16,366 --> 00:25:18,493
I do. Always.

316
00:25:22,886 --> 00:25:25,586
I've had this view for a really long time.

317
00:25:26,462 --> 00:25:27,262
What do you mean ?

318
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:30,107
I saw you...

319
00:25:31,108 --> 00:25:31,757
with Tom.

320
00:25:35,673 --> 00:25:37,873
You saw me... when ?

321
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:39,049
Here.

322
00:25:44,163 --> 00:25:46,363
It was, like, just after Rose was born.

323
00:25:46,638 --> 00:25:47,238
I was on my bed,

324
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:49,445
and I was waitin' for you to get back from work, and...

325
00:25:50,474 --> 00:25:51,458
I looked out...

326
00:25:54,405 --> 00:25:55,432
and I saw you.

327
00:25:57,564 --> 00:25:58,708
I saw you kiss him...

328
00:25:59,709 --> 00:26:00,532
while you were still married...

329
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:01,304
Jesse.

330
00:26:01,304 --> 00:26:02,437
And don't try and tell me that it didn't happen

331
00:26:02,638 --> 00:26:04,838
because--because I saw it, and I'm--

332
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:06,624
I'm sure it happened a lot.

333
00:26:06,825 --> 00:26:10,909
Jesse, I didn't leave your father for Tom.

334
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,790
Tom had nothing to do with it...

335
00:26:17,107 --> 00:26:17,907
and if you...

336
00:26:20,725 --> 00:26:22,055
saw something one night...

337
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:31,906
I don't know. We'd been friends.

338
00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:38,145
The bottom line is,

339
00:26:38,546 --> 00:26:42,691
your father and I had grown very far apart, Jesse.

340
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:45,773
We were kids when we got married.

341
00:26:45,774 --> 00:26:47,067
We were just a few years older than you.

342
00:26:47,068 --> 00:26:49,068
It doesn't matter, mom.

343
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,490
It was wrong.

344
00:26:52,632 --> 00:26:54,632
What you did was wrong...

345
00:26:55,523 --> 00:26:57,123
and dad...

346
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:59,124
dad didn't want you to leave.

347
00:26:59,225 --> 00:27:01,774
Dad didn't want to lose you, Jess.

348
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:04,475
He still doesn't...

349
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,520
but neither do I.

350
00:27:20,971 --> 00:27:22,275
Divorce sucks, Jesse...

351
00:27:29,766 --> 00:27:30,750
and I'm sorry.

352
00:27:33,532 --> 00:27:34,658
And...

353
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:36,813
I just hope that there's some way

354
00:27:36,814 --> 00:27:38,525
you can learn to forgive me.

355
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,190
Tom, have your guys keep an eye out for a dark sedan.

356
00:28:06,191 --> 00:28:07,385
<i>Larkin may be in it.</i>

357
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:08,729
Where did you get this information ?

358
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,735
A fisherman we just talked to said he may

359
00:28:10,831 --> 00:28:11,324
<i>have seen her.</i>

360
00:28:11,459 --> 00:28:13,070
<i>He said he saw a couple in a dark sedan.</i>

361
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:14,071
What fisherman, Russ ?

362
00:28:14,113 --> 00:28:15,888
Some guy whose truck had broken down.

363
00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:17,883
You got it. I'll let my people know.

364
00:28:23,671 --> 00:28:26,499
If you can hear me, answer.

365
00:28:32,137 --> 00:28:34,941
In Haiti, we call a child a " grande bénédiction",

366
00:28:36,542 --> 00:28:38,542
a great blessing.

367
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:42,259
When I depart from Haiti,
I took the last boat

368
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,860
just before Clinton sent in the troops.

369
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,608
The boat was full,

370
00:28:48,009 --> 00:28:51,346
but they made room for my wife because she was pregnant.

371
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:53,701
You see, a great blessing.

372
00:28:54,102 --> 00:28:55,488
She was pregnant with your son ?

373
00:28:55,889 --> 00:28:56,789
He save our life.

374
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,540
And now he's 9 ?

375
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,804
Yes.

376
00:29:05,908 --> 00:29:09,248
Clinton sent troops in '94.

377
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:14,257
11 years ago.

378
00:29:18,587 --> 00:29:19,287
Of course, he's 11.

379
00:29:21,516 --> 00:29:23,516
It goes by so quickly.

380
00:29:24,904 --> 00:29:25,404
You'll see.

381
00:29:29,505 --> 00:29:31,205
I think the engine was flooded.

382
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:32,942
I'll try now.

383
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,840
I should have given that guy a radio, in case he sees her.

384
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:42,179
Well, if we haven't found her
by the time we get to krome avenue,

385
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,180
we'll double back, okay ?

386
00:29:45,077 --> 00:29:45,777
Okay ?

387
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:52,850
Hey, we're going to find her, Russ, okay ?

388
00:29:53,452 --> 00:29:54,548
No, we are.

389
00:29:55,549 --> 00:29:57,449
She's good out here.
She learned from the best.

390
00:29:58,185 --> 00:30:00,185
She used to be so afraid of this place.

391
00:30:01,047 --> 00:30:01,971
What, the glades ?

392
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:07,437
You know, when I first met her,
she was still living in Miami.

393
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:11,016
I gave her a tour of the park.

394
00:30:12,403 --> 00:30:14,575
She said it was like no place she'd ever seen.

395
00:30:16,176 --> 00:30:17,678
It really scared her.

396
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:19,523
Why ?

397
00:30:19,924 --> 00:30:21,805
It was unknown.

398
00:30:22,206 --> 00:30:24,259
Plus she's so driven to get to the truth of things,

399
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,843
and the unknown really scares her.

400
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:31,632
Well, she's not scared out here anymore, is she ?

401
00:30:32,033 --> 00:30:33,533
No.

402
00:30:34,659 --> 00:30:36,359
Sometimes I wish she were.

403
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:40,191
Russ, hey.

404
00:30:42,392 --> 00:30:44,392
Yeah, that sounds good.

405
00:30:49,701 --> 00:30:50,301
Anything ?

406
00:30:50,538 --> 00:30:52,048
Just a couple of insurance adjusters.

407
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:53,721
They got lost on their way to Florida city.

408
00:30:53,722 --> 00:30:55,493
- What about you ?
- No.

409
00:30:55,894 --> 00:30:57,243
All right,we're going to double back.

410
00:30:57,644 --> 00:30:58,722
All right,we'll stay on it.

411
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,238
I have to go.

412
00:31:18,939 --> 00:31:19,986
Wait, wait ! It's almost fixed !

413
00:31:20,387 --> 00:31:22,787
- No, can't wait.
- You're not going to make it.

414
00:31:22,858 --> 00:31:24,704
- You have to stay here.
- I have to try !

415
00:31:28,074 --> 00:31:28,816
You're freezing.

416
00:31:29,217 --> 00:31:30,163
Go inside.

417
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:35,290
Okay, okay, five more minutes,
five more minutes.

418
00:31:35,818 --> 00:31:36,815
I promise.

419
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:42,015
Take my jacket, here, here.

420
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,660
Fishing.

421
00:31:46,751 --> 00:31:48,035
Put the jacket on and go inside.

422
00:31:59,929 --> 00:32:01,929
Guys ? Hey.

423
00:32:02,711 --> 00:32:03,925
Hey, I have to goin to work now.

424
00:32:03,926 --> 00:32:05,423
Kira, do you mind sticking around for a little while,

425
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:07,251
- just until Russell gets home ?
- Sure.

426
00:32:07,852 --> 00:32:09,469
Let me know if you hear anything about Larkin, okay ?

427
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,570
Bye, sweetie. I love you.

428
00:32:12,422 --> 00:32:13,171
I love you, too.

429
00:32:30,355 --> 00:32:30,855
Hey, mom ?

430
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:33,431
Hey.

431
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:34,564
Leaving ?

432
00:32:34,965 --> 00:32:35,565
Yeah.

433
00:32:37,782 --> 00:32:38,684
I didn't know where you were.

434
00:32:39,885 --> 00:32:40,585
I'm here.

435
00:32:55,114 --> 00:32:56,114
You know...

436
00:32:58,626 --> 00:32:59,400
I, uh...

437
00:33:05,633 --> 00:33:07,050
I just don't want to lose you.

438
00:33:09,751 --> 00:33:10,560
Jesse.

439
00:33:14,891 --> 00:33:16,491
That is never going to happen.

440
00:33:18,134 --> 00:33:19,334
Never.

441
00:33:31,741 --> 00:33:33,741
Miss, the truck is ready.

442
00:33:34,522 --> 00:33:37,394
I want to you tell me--tell me who you really are

443
00:33:38,995 --> 00:33:40,357
and what you're really doing here.

444
00:33:40,358 --> 00:33:41,769
I told you who I am.

445
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,198
I don't believe you.

446
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:45,087
You didn't even know your son's age.

447
00:33:45,088 --> 00:33:46,296
I made a mistake.

448
00:33:46,697 --> 00:33:49,508
You... you wouldn't take me to the hospital,

449
00:33:50,509 --> 00:33:51,521
and you take me here.

450
00:33:54,622 --> 00:33:56,622
Who the hell are you ?

451
00:33:57,177 --> 00:33:58,302
Stop it, stop !

452
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,370
Stop !

453
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:00,479
Stop !

454
00:34:04,873 --> 00:34:06,858
Stop !

455
00:34:16,905 --> 00:34:18,480
- Come with me.
- No.

456
00:34:20,943 --> 00:34:23,790
Come with me now, or your baby will die.

457
00:34:45,243 --> 00:34:45,942
Tell me who you are.

458
00:34:46,343 --> 00:34:49,288
Come with me. I will show you.

459
00:35:03,455 --> 00:35:04,399
My secret.

460
00:35:09,928 --> 00:35:11,392
I am a fisherman,

461
00:35:11,793 --> 00:35:13,793
but I was hired by the military to catch this beast.

462
00:35:15,299 --> 00:35:16,726
It doesn't belong here in these waters.

463
00:35:17,127 --> 00:35:18,883
I think it came up in the hurricane.

464
00:35:24,437 --> 00:35:26,208
- It looks like a squid.
- It is.

465
00:35:26,409 --> 00:35:27,354
Deep sea.

466
00:35:28,055 --> 00:35:28,655
But the military--

467
00:35:28,816 --> 00:35:30,816
I think they were afraid it was something else,

468
00:35:31,482 --> 00:35:33,953
because when it swims, it makes a light.

469
00:35:35,754 --> 00:35:37,754
They pay me a lot of money to catch it.

470
00:35:38,155 --> 00:35:40,255
I was supposed to deliver to the air base an hour ago.

471
00:35:41,354 --> 00:35:44,171
If I'm late, I'm afraid they're not going to pay me.

472
00:35:55,184 --> 00:35:56,092
All this...

473
00:35:59,371 --> 00:36:00,495
for a fish.

474
00:36:09,356 --> 00:36:10,656
I have to leave you. I'm sorry.

475
00:36:12,323 --> 00:36:14,171
- That truck, it will stop here.
- No !

476
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:15,472
They are looking for you.

477
00:36:17,503 --> 00:36:19,464
They will stop here.
They are looking for you.

478
00:36:19,865 --> 00:36:21,523
I'm sorry. Good luck.

479
00:36:21,924 --> 00:36:22,770
I'm sorry !

480
00:36:43,045 --> 00:36:43,805
Oh, my god.

481
00:36:52,524 --> 00:36:54,524
Larkin !

482
00:37:29,682 --> 00:37:30,372
You okay ?

483
00:37:31,873 --> 00:37:33,873
Let's type and cross her for a match
and start heron packed cells.

484
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,310
I called your doctor.
He's on his way in.

485
00:37:36,711 --> 00:37:38,711
Is... is the baby...

486
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:40,619
is the baby okay ?

487
00:37:42,461 --> 00:37:43,743
We're going to find that out right now.

488
00:37:46,244 --> 00:37:47,340
We're oxygenating your blood,

489
00:37:47,741 --> 00:37:49,158
which is exactly what the baby needs.

490
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:13,384
Sometimes it takes a minute.

491
00:38:45,181 --> 00:38:46,357
Here we go.

492
00:38:50,288 --> 00:38:52,088
Sounds good, huh ?

493
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:54,941
I'll leave you two alone for a minute.

494
00:38:59,622 --> 00:39:00,497
Russell...

495
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,866
I was so scared.

496
00:39:05,267 --> 00:39:07,264
Yeah, I know.

497
00:39:07,665 --> 00:39:08,566
I was, too.

498
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,809
I know what's in the water, Russ.

499
00:39:53,468 --> 00:39:55,468
You should pay me double
for what I've been through today.

500
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,760
This wasn't what I wanted.

501
00:39:57,806 --> 00:40:01,728
I was at that pond at 5:30,
5:30 this morning,

502
00:40:01,729 --> 00:40:04,029
sitting with that stinking thing in that back of my truck.

503
00:40:04,742 --> 00:40:06,742
Then you call and say,
"she had an accident".

504
00:40:07,142 --> 00:40:08,166
"See if you can find her."

505
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:09,067
So I found her.

506
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,490
You should have taken her to the hospital.

507
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,242
I was going to, but then you said, "stall."

508
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,903
I had to figure out who those people were,

509
00:40:14,304 --> 00:40:16,379
- see if they were trying to kill her.
- And ?

510
00:40:22,074 --> 00:40:22,674
And they're air force.

511
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:24,096
They've been tracking her for a few days.

512
00:40:24,497 --> 00:40:25,833
So they're the ones that pushed her off the road.

513
00:40:25,834 --> 00:40:28,231
She saw something at the base
that she wasn't supposed to,

514
00:40:28,232 --> 00:40:29,413
and they got nervous.

515
00:40:33,378 --> 00:40:34,744
They won't bother her anymore.

516
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,012
Well, I showed her your fish.

517
00:40:42,403 --> 00:40:43,722
I hope it gets you what you want.

518
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:58,433
So just between you and me,
these lights in the water,

519
00:40:58,434 --> 00:41:00,566
if they're not squid,
then what are they ?

520
00:41:02,967 --> 00:41:04,067
Fish.
