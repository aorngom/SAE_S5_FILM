1
00:00:00,332 --> 00:00:01,470
Good morning.

2
00:00:02,783 --> 00:00:05,125
Didn't I paint your condo
a couple weeks ago?

3
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:08,658
No, a bunch of workers painted my condo
while you hit on me.

4
00:00:08,965 --> 00:00:11,542
You know what? Those workers
are living the american dream.

5
00:00:11,662 --> 00:00:15,398
You show up on time, you work hard,
and just maybe your boss will get laid.

6
00:00:16,526 --> 00:00:18,204
OK. Let's go take a shower.

7
00:00:18,474 --> 00:00:20,314
You know what?
You go take a shower.

8
00:00:20,476 --> 00:00:22,946
I'm going to lay here
and try to put a name

9
00:00:23,074 --> 00:00:25,713
on some of those positions
I invented last night.

10
00:00:26,653 --> 00:00:29,293
Honey, half those positions aren't new,
and the last one,

11
00:00:29,421 --> 00:00:30,915
I think you stumbled into.

12
00:00:31,623 --> 00:00:34,761
I might have stumbled into it,
but I'm pretty sure I stuck the landing.

13
00:00:36,146 --> 00:00:38,731
You were great.
Last night was unbelievable.

14
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,023
There's plenty more
where that came from...

15
00:00:42,357 --> 00:00:44,153
If I can ever walk again.

16
00:00:45,718 --> 00:00:46,754
My back.

17
00:00:57,247 --> 00:00:58,382
What's up?

18
00:00:59,849 --> 00:01:01,641
- You got any shampoo?
- Yeah, just

19
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:05,051
grab one of the empty bottles, put
some water in it, and just shake it up.

20
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:11,933
Please let that be a
door-to-door chiropractor.

21
00:01:14,426 --> 00:01:16,368
- Who is that?
- That's my ex-wife.

22
00:01:16,532 --> 00:01:18,692
If we're quiet,
she'll probably just go away.

23
00:01:18,867 --> 00:01:21,828
Gary, believe me, you need to
have a civil relationship with your ex.

24
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:24,332
So just go downstairs,
be pleasant, and see what she wants.

25
00:01:24,452 --> 00:01:27,276
I know what she wants.
She already has my left one.

26
00:01:31,309 --> 00:01:32,694
- Hi, dad.
- Hi, Cutie.

27
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:35,723
I love you. What's going on?
Why aren't the kids at school?

28
00:01:35,885 --> 00:01:38,246
We had to stop by here to pick up
everything you forgot

29
00:01:38,366 --> 00:01:41,037
- to drop off with them last night.
- What are you talking about?

30
00:01:41,157 --> 00:01:44,018
I put everything they had into their
backpacks. What did I forget?

31
00:01:44,185 --> 00:01:45,296
Their backpacks.

32
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:49,611
And I got a speeding ticket
on the way over here, too.

33
00:01:49,774 --> 00:01:51,592
You got a speeding ticket?
What's the matter?

34
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:54,554
Your two lady friends couldn't
help get you out of it?

35
00:01:56,289 --> 00:01:58,332
No, Gary.
I'm not going to sink to that level.

36
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,999
Why not?
They have.

37
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,289
You know what, Gary?
If we were at Mardi gras,

38
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:06,604
you would get way more beads,
my friend. OK?

39
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:09,766
- That's right.
- It's not in my room, mom.

40
00:02:09,886 --> 00:02:12,904
We still can't find Louise's cello.
How do you lose a cello, Gary?

41
00:02:13,024 --> 00:02:15,187
I don't know.
I've looked everywhere for that thing.

42
00:02:15,382 --> 00:02:17,333
Get in the car.
I'll be right out. All right?

43
00:02:17,462 --> 00:02:19,934
- Bye, dad.
- Do you have any tests today?

44
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,647
Je vais fais une exam du francias.

45
00:02:24,767 --> 00:02:28,220
That's fantastic.
Too bad we're never going to Germany.

46
00:02:30,896 --> 00:02:34,323
- Why are you walking like your father?
- What? I hurt my back.

47
00:02:34,485 --> 00:02:37,495
My gosh! You're the only one alive
that knows how to fix it.

48
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,114
- What?
- Come on. You can do it.

49
00:02:39,234 --> 00:02:40,921
I'll get on the ground.
You fix it.

50
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,020
In order to fix your back,
I would have to get on

51
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,405
the floor and climb all over you.
It's crossing a line.

52
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:47,924
Come on. Help me.
Help me! Just do it!

53
00:02:49,418 --> 00:02:51,589
All right, but no unnecessary wiggling.

54
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,531
How'd you hurt it this time?
What? With lifting something?

55
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:56,399
No, I wasn't lifting weights.

56
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,160
What, are you painting ceilings?

57
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,761
Allison, I did not hurt my back
doing anything you warned me about, OK?

58
00:03:01,883 --> 00:03:05,185
I hurt my back having super-amazing
hot sex with my new girlfriend.

59
00:03:05,305 --> 00:03:07,261
- And I'm done.
- What?

60
00:03:08,847 --> 00:03:10,109
You never even touched me!

61
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:13,733
I don't want to hear about your sex
life, OK? Learn some boundaries, man.

62
00:03:13,853 --> 00:03:15,432
Boundaries?

63
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:17,100
You're engaged to our marriage

64
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,382
therapist. Don't you think
that's crossing a boundary?

65
00:03:19,502 --> 00:03:22,871
Dr. Walter krandall did everything could
to save our marriage, including me.

66
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:25,597
And I only said that because
I knew you were going to.

67
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:28,973
I bet if Dr. Walter krandall
hurt his back

68
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:31,737
and couldn't ride his dumb little bike
around town, you'd fix it.

69
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:34,648
I would fix walter's back
because he is my fiance...

70
00:03:34,947 --> 00:03:36,635
And he's also a published author

71
00:03:36,902 --> 00:03:40,135
and has appeared in "Time" magazine,
and he was on the "Today" show.

72
00:03:40,255 --> 00:03:41,402
Yeah. What?

73
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:43,830
Willard scott was wishing
him happy birthday?

74
00:03:49,818 --> 00:03:51,911
- Are these your keys?
- Yes, they are.

75
00:03:52,075 --> 00:03:53,772
Come on, tom.
We're gonna be late.

76
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:56,473
See you, dad.

77
00:03:57,019 --> 00:03:58,873
That's your phone that's been buzzing?

78
00:03:58,993 --> 00:04:00,127
It's just danielle.

79
00:04:00,247 --> 00:04:02,745
She called me 11 times this morning.
So I stopped answering it.

80
00:04:02,907 --> 00:04:05,013
I didn't know danielle
was being so possessive.

81
00:04:05,151 --> 00:04:06,217
A little bit.

82
00:04:06,355 --> 00:04:10,168
You know, she insists on holding
my hand all the time, even during lunch.

83
00:04:10,623 --> 00:04:11,866
I can't eat.

84
00:04:13,223 --> 00:04:15,721
And I think my left hand is
getting smaller from all the squeezing.

85
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:18,001
Hold it out. Let me see that left hand.

86
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:21,361
Let me see, with that left hand,
if you can pick up daddy's keys.

87
00:04:21,836 --> 00:04:25,893
There you go. You're a good guy.
Listen, I got to tell you something,

88
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:29,051
Tommy, this is a good thing, OK?
This girl likes you. Right?

89
00:04:29,174 --> 00:04:30,911
Plus, you're getting hand.

90
00:04:34,252 --> 00:04:36,305
I am the first of my friends to get it.

91
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:38,148
That a boy!

92
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,798
But if she wasn't so hot,
i'd think she was crazy.

93
00:04:41,555 --> 00:04:45,056
Yeah. It's a good thing
the hot ones are never crazy.

Please. Just do this thing for my back.
Come on. You just...

97
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:57,466
you get my hand up over my head,

98
00:04:57,912 --> 00:05:01,519
and you sit down on my hips,
and then you straddle me,

99
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:05,383
and you just kind of rock my hips around
like this until you hear something pop.

All right. That's good.

Gosh. My hand.

104
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:20,448
My back.
I just put my hand on my back!

105
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:25,425
If I was in my old house, forget it.
Would have cracked my back,

106
00:05:25,545 --> 00:05:28,010
I would sit in my hot tub,
and I would be as good as new.

Did I tell you my wife
just gained 60 pounds?

Look, here's the thing with Vanessa.
You saw her. She's beautiful.

111
00:05:39,693 --> 00:05:42,511
And for some reason, she thinks I'm
incredible. I've got keep up with her.

Holy smokes. Honor student,
my ass. You know what?

Yeah? That's real classy

Not even in the downstairs, my god!

What are you doing?
You're never home at this time of day!

130
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,732
What? I skipped a class to come
home and, you know, study for a paper.

131
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,995
OK, you know what? I don't need

Were you in my hot tub?

133
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,963
No, I was in my hot tub that
I built with my hands on my patio.

00:06:56,087 --> 00:06:58,243
That my lawyer was able to get from

135

00:07:02,335 --> 00:07:05,047
Look, Gary,
I mean, i'm sorry about your back. I am.

137
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:08,551
But really, seriously, coming over
here and. What are you doing?

138
00:07:08,884 --> 00:07:11,264
- I'm changing out of my trunks.
- In my kitchen?

139
00:07:11,442 --> 00:07:13,306
Yeah, because you always
used to get mad at me

140
00:07:13,426 --> 00:07:15,222
if I would track water
through the house.

141
00:07:15,345 --> 00:07:16,331
Gary, you just.

142
00:07:16,492 --> 00:07:19,176
I can't believe you would
just undress in front of me. God.

143
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,529
All right. Big deal.
I don't see what the big deal is.

144
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,922
I mean, getting undressed
in front of you, it's like

145
00:07:24,042 --> 00:07:26,374
it's like getting undressed
in front of a dude.

146
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:29,048
A dude?

147
00:07:29,168 --> 00:07:31,467
I gonna say dog, but I knew
it would rub you the wrong way.

148
00:07:31,587 --> 00:07:32,688
You know what, Gary?

149
00:07:32,846 --> 00:07:36,314
You've got to get your suit back on
and go. And from now on, new boundaries,

150
00:07:36,434 --> 00:07:39,762
OK? You are not allowed in my house
or anywhere outside of my house.

151
00:07:39,957 --> 00:07:43,116
OK? And I am not going to go in your
house. And why are you still naked?

152
00:07:43,294 --> 00:07:47,146
Because my back just locked up.
I can't bend down and pick up my shorts.

153
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,056
- For god's sakes!
- I need your help.

154
00:07:49,176 --> 00:07:50,988
Help me pick up my shorts.

155
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,370
All right.
All right, give me your right foot.

156
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,193
OK.

157
00:08:03,532 --> 00:08:06,217
- Your right foot. Jeez, what are you 3?
- I'm sorry.

158
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:08,993
I can't believe you, Gary.
You come into my house,

159
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:12,567
you dig through my fridge, you drop your
pants. You know what? Do it yourself!

160
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,610
- OK.
- God, it's just...

161
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:20,567
Right. I don't know why you're making
such big deal out of such a tiny thing.

162
00:08:20,687 --> 00:08:22,619
That's because the tiny thing
is in my kitchen.

163
00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:24,337
You are cranking the air conditioner,

164
00:08:24,457 --> 00:08:26,463
I was just standing in frot
of a cold refrigerator.

165
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,320
You know what, Gary?
This is my house!

166
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,758
I know it's your house,
Allison, and I respect that.

167
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:33,985
I was only using the hot tub because
of my back, and that's the truth.

168
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,062
Burgers are ready.

169
00:08:44,188 --> 00:08:46,487
My gosh.
This is heaven on my back.

170
00:08:54,972 --> 00:08:56,946
I knew that was going to happen!

171
00:08:57,406 --> 00:08:59,515
And yet...
i did it anyway.

172
00:09:01,186 --> 00:09:03,291
- Dad?
- Over here, honey.

173
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,356
- Hi, dad.
- Hi. How are you? Sorry.

174
00:09:06,476 --> 00:09:09,796
I didn't find your cello yet, OK?
Hey, where's your brother?

175
00:09:10,002 --> 00:09:11,205
Right behind me.

176
00:09:14,927 --> 00:09:17,281
Tommy, puberty hit you hard.

177
00:09:18,987 --> 00:09:21,178
- Hello, Gary.
- Hello, Krandall.

178
00:09:22,425 --> 00:09:25,187
Allison asked if I could pick
Tom and Louise up from school.

179
00:09:25,311 --> 00:09:26,395
Great. Where's Tom?

180
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:29,364
Unfortunately, I only had
enough room on my bike for one.

181
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:35,627
He made me run behind him!

182
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,667
That's not the definition
of being picked up at all!

183
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:44,641
- What's going on here, Krandall?
- Every light in the house apparently.

184
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:50,561
I understand there was an
incident between you and Allison.

185
00:09:50,943 --> 00:09:53,053
She prefers not to
speak to you for a while.

186
00:09:53,173 --> 00:09:55,989
Really? She's punishing me by
not coming into my house?

187
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:59,466
I hope she doesn't get really mean
and stop cashing my alimony checks.

188
00:09:59,991 --> 00:10:02,013
I don't know what's going
on between the two of you,

189
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:04,607
but if you'd like to talk about it,
i'll put on my therapist's hat.

190
00:10:04,727 --> 00:10:07,342
OK. Does it come with
a chin strap like that one?

191
00:10:07,462 --> 00:10:09,605
Deflective humor. That's very healthy.

192
00:10:09,729 --> 00:10:12,916
But if you give me your version of it,
I will offer my keen insight.

193
00:10:13,036 --> 00:10:15,895
Yeah. No offense, Krandall.
I don't think so. I mean, come on.

194
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:19,204
You're going to marry my ex-wife.
You can't be much smarter than I am.

195
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,864
I tried talking to her,
but she wouldn't share with me either.

196
00:10:26,984 --> 00:10:28,878
Me, of all people.
I'm a professional.

197
00:10:28,998 --> 00:10:31,654
Do you know that one of
my clients is sir ben kingsley?

198
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:33,617
You're not supposed to tell me that.

199
00:10:34,741 --> 00:10:38,265
I know. I know. I got an earful about
that from parker posey.

200
00:10:44,257 --> 00:10:46,458
Listen, Danielle,
OK, I have homework to do.

201
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:47,831
OK? I really need to go.

202
00:10:47,951 --> 00:10:49,985
Can't we watch each other do homework?

203
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,412
Did you just minimize me?

204
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:56,219
No, no. There's something
wrong with the computer.

205
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,619
I bet any minute now, it's just, rrr!

206
00:11:01,151 --> 00:11:02,631
I like that one.

207
00:11:03,517 --> 00:11:05,363
This girl's really getting to you,
isn't she?

208
00:11:05,483 --> 00:11:07,188
She's driving me crazy, dad.

209
00:11:07,331 --> 00:11:09,971
She calls me all the time.
She stuffs notes in my locker.

210
00:11:10,097 --> 00:11:12,964
You know, today she made me
hold hands with her during the assembly.

211
00:11:13,142 --> 00:11:16,658
Both hands.
It was like we were figure skating.

212
00:11:16,778 --> 00:11:20,568
All right. So, Tommy,
why are you putting up with all this?

213
00:11:21,033 --> 00:11:22,930
Because I'm just an average guy, OK?

214
00:11:23,143 --> 00:11:26,893
- And she's a totally banging girl.
- OK. Tommy, let me tell you something.

215
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:30,819
You show me a banging girl, and
I'll show you a guy that's tired of...

216
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:32,319
Holding her hands.

217
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,820
OK. So... so what should I do, dad? OK?

218
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,623
- I don't want to break up with her.
- You just have to be honest with her.

219
00:11:38,743 --> 00:11:41,399
You have to take her for a walk and
tell her to ease up a bit. That's all.

220
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,364
<i>A walk?</i>

221
00:11:42,492 --> 00:11:43,252
Really?

222
00:11:43,372 --> 00:11:46,177
Women respond to honesty.
I mean, if this girl is wearing you out,

223
00:11:46,297 --> 00:11:48,494
you can't just act like nothing's wrong.

224
00:11:48,614 --> 00:11:49,976
My gosh.

225
00:11:50,741 --> 00:11:53,047
- Are you all right, dad?
- Nothing's wrong...

226
00:11:56,587 --> 00:11:57,870
It's Danielle.

227
00:11:58,631 --> 00:12:01,067
My god. She's calling
from inside the house.

228
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:05,102
Listen,
be strong, OK?

229
00:12:05,578 --> 00:12:07,313
- Thanks.
- All right. You got it.

230
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,591
Hey, Louise.
Hi, honey. What's up?

231
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:13,206
- My ride's here.
- Look.

232
00:12:13,326 --> 00:12:16,750
You don't have to go to cello practice.
You have nothing to play.

233
00:12:16,942 --> 00:12:18,466
I'm in band, dad.

234
00:12:18,601 --> 00:12:22,164
If I had anything better to do,
don't you think i'd be doing it?

235
00:12:26,282 --> 00:12:29,312
- Hey, I'm taking off dad. OK?
- Wait. Where are you going?

236
00:12:29,432 --> 00:12:31,226
Danielle and I are going
to go on that...

237
00:12:31,346 --> 00:12:33,194
- that walk.
- When are you gonna be back?

238
00:12:33,314 --> 00:12:36,827
I don't know. I've got to go over to
her house. So I'll just. I'll see you.

239
00:12:37,572 --> 00:12:39,170
There you are, slowpoke.

240
00:12:45,092 --> 00:12:48,387
Yuck. This is awful,
all these bendy,

241
00:12:49,118 --> 00:12:51,882
flexible,
hairless men.

242
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:55,564
Which one is abercrombie?

243
00:12:59,107 --> 00:13:01,346
- Hi. Hi, Vanessa.
- Hey, handsome.

244
00:13:02,871 --> 00:13:05,454
Who was that little blonde
girl pulling your son like a wagon?

245
00:13:05,862 --> 00:13:09,963
That's his girlfriend.
She's crazy... about him.

246
00:13:10,088 --> 00:13:13,087
Where's parker?
Don't you have him tonight?

247
00:13:13,249 --> 00:13:15,765
I did, but his dad wanted to
take him to a game, so we switched.

248
00:13:15,885 --> 00:13:19,392
- Thought you'd want to hang out.
- Yeah, sure. What...

249
00:13:20,002 --> 00:13:22,179
- What did you have in mind?
- I don't know.

250
00:13:22,363 --> 00:13:24,682
Drink some beers,
watch some football, just be mellow.

251
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:25,778
Really?

252
00:13:26,057 --> 00:13:29,333
That's fantastic.
You have no idea how good that sounds,

253
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:31,748
because I've been meaning
to tell you that my back.

254
00:13:32,233 --> 00:13:34,441
- Hello, boys.
- My back is very horny.

255
00:13:40,184 --> 00:13:42,970
- Would you look at this?
- Hello, my dear. Hope you don't mind.

256
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:47,376
- I let myself in.
- Not at all. What am I smelling?

257
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:51,268
The <i>Chateau Briand</i>, and it's going
to burn unless I find a set of tongs.

258
00:13:53,894 --> 00:13:57,659
Walter, you are so wonderful.
This is exactly what I need tonight.

259
00:13:59,137 --> 00:14:02,421
Hope your day's getting a little
bit better. I spoke to gary earlier.

260
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,937
Please, don't say that name. I'm having
a nice moment. Let me enjoy this.

261
00:14:06,057 --> 00:14:10,324
Absolutely. That's exactly my plan.
If you want to share anything with me,

262
00:14:10,452 --> 00:14:12,422
as sir ben kingsley does
each wednesday...

263
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:15,034
No, Walter.
Walter, I love you.

264
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,291
I just don't want to talk.
I want to relax.

265
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,209
Then I have something
very special for you.

266
00:14:20,345 --> 00:14:22,901
- Close your eyes.
- I like the sound of that.

267
00:14:23,716 --> 00:14:25,025
Keep them closed.

268
00:14:28,518 --> 00:14:31,031
Oh, my god!

269
00:14:31,248 --> 00:14:32,472
Beautiful, isn't it?

270
00:14:33,217 --> 00:14:35,287
Walter, where the
hell did you find that?

271
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:38,057
It was in the laundry
room under a pile of clothes.

272
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,664
Why didn't you tell me
you had a cello in the house?

273
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,189
This is awful.

274
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,611
Admittedly I haven't played
in a while, but

275
00:14:44,731 --> 00:14:47,014
why am I defending myself?
What instrument do you play?

276
00:14:51,861 --> 00:14:54,447
Are you OK, sweetie?
You kind of sound like you're in pain.

277
00:14:54,624 --> 00:14:56,243
Pain? Me? No.

278
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:59,423
Non. Mal?
No, I'm doing, you know, like, primal...

279
00:15:00,396 --> 00:15:01,929
Like grunting noises, you know.

280
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:04,990
I don't know if you know anything
about the Silver-Back Gorilla.

281
00:15:05,152 --> 00:15:07,821
- I do, actually.
- Well, then never mind.

282
00:15:08,422 --> 00:15:10,914
- Just sit down.
- OK. You know what?

283
00:15:11,148 --> 00:15:13,125
Speaking of gorilla colors,

284
00:15:14,895 --> 00:15:18,012
i'm going to go downstairs and make
an emergency paint order.

285
00:15:18,132 --> 00:15:20,871
- An emergency paint order?
- Look, don't break my chops, honey.

286
00:15:20,991 --> 00:15:24,867
You knew what you were getting into the
minute you started dating a painter, OK?

287
00:15:27,255 --> 00:15:28,469
OK. All right.

288
00:15:41,564 --> 00:15:43,064
Cello, Allison.

289
00:15:46,314 --> 00:15:49,076
- Gary, what are you doing?
- What am I doing? What are you doing?

290
00:15:50,163 --> 00:15:53,003
Just dropping off the Cello.
Yeah, it turns out it was...

291
00:15:53,216 --> 00:15:55,969
It was in my laundry room the whole
time. Isn't that funny? All right, bye.

292
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:58,346
No, wait.
So you just bring it in my house,

293
00:15:58,466 --> 00:16:00,669
sneak it in here and act like
it was here the whole time?

294
00:16:00,789 --> 00:16:03,689
I thought you were out,
and you, you broke into my house today.

295
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:05,915
I had to use the hot tub
because you would fix my back.

296
00:16:06,044 --> 00:16:09,419
Look, I don't care what it was, Gary. We
need to stick to the boundaries we set.

297
00:16:09,546 --> 00:16:12,641
No, no, no. The boundaries
that you set that I don't understand,

298
00:16:12,761 --> 00:16:15,951
because I don't really care who
comes in whose house. It doesn't

299
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:19,785
make sense to me. And I'm not even
sure why you're so mad. Oh, my god!

300
00:16:19,905 --> 00:16:21,241
My back, Allison!

301
00:16:21,641 --> 00:16:24,102
Please help me!
I can't even move!

302
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:29,237
You don't know why i'm so mad, Gary?

303
00:16:30,081 --> 00:16:31,912
All right.
Where do I start?

304
00:16:33,524 --> 00:16:35,845
I couldn't flirt my way out
of a speeding ticket

305
00:16:35,969 --> 00:16:37,591
for the first time in my life!

306
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,694
And then when the cop looked
at my birth date,

307
00:16:41,814 --> 00:16:44,639
he asked me if I might
know his mother... and I did.

308
00:16:46,884 --> 00:16:50,836
And then my stupid ex-husband
whose back is sore from

309
00:16:51,003 --> 00:16:53,801
having too much sex with his
young girlfriend

310
00:16:55,194 --> 00:16:56,740
undressed in front of me

311
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:00,554
and said it wasn't any different from
undressing in front of a dude!

312
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,145
That's it?

313
00:17:04,497 --> 00:17:07,378
That's what you're so fired up about.
The dude comment?

314
00:17:07,723 --> 00:17:10,038
My gosh!
I feel better!

315
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:13,060
All right!

316
00:17:13,355 --> 00:17:15,871
What do you care what I think about you?
I'm your ex-husband!

317
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:18,330
Exactly, Gary.
We were married.

318
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,464
You had 2 children with this dude.

319
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,858
I don't want you to want me.

320
00:17:22,978 --> 00:17:25,314
Just acknowledge that
i'm still wantable. No?

321
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,594
I mean, my god. You don't know
what it's like. It's different for men.

322
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,337
Different? I don't know what it's like
to get old? I'm like the tin man!

323
00:17:31,457 --> 00:17:34,000
You had to oil-can me down there,
for crying out loud!

324
00:17:34,672 --> 00:17:37,448
Look, Allison,
don't whine about this.

325
00:17:37,568 --> 00:17:40,584
I mean, you're almost 40,
sure, but you're still banging.

326
00:17:40,771 --> 00:17:42,113
What is...
banging?

327
00:17:43,193 --> 00:17:46,896
Look, I'm sorry about today.
I shouldn't have been in your hot tub.

328
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,936
I'm sorry I was in your house.

329
00:17:49,056 --> 00:17:52,471
I'm sorry I said that it was
like being undressed in front of a dude.

330
00:17:52,591 --> 00:17:54,410
I was just being an idiot. I'm sorry.

331
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,295
Banging like...
like how?

332
00:17:59,362 --> 00:18:02,250
Banging, like, if we had met
in a bar and I didn't know you at all

333
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,625
and you were wearing the red
dress and you had your hair up...

334
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:06,875
Anything else?

335
00:18:07,283 --> 00:18:09,570
If you weren't talking so much

336
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,841
or criticizing what I was wearing
or complaining about the service...

337
00:18:13,684 --> 00:18:17,363
I would go up to you in that bar,
and I would ask you to dance,

338
00:18:17,483 --> 00:18:20,722
and I would do everything in my
power to get you to go to bed with me.

339
00:18:21,812 --> 00:18:23,659
- Really?
- Yes, really.

340
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,238
Thank you.

341
00:18:25,366 --> 00:18:28,202
Assuming it was last call
and there was no one there younger.

342
00:18:30,653 --> 00:18:32,589
Come on. I thought it
would make you feel better.

343
00:18:32,709 --> 00:18:35,804
You know, it did. A little, and then it
didn't, and then it almost did again,

344
00:18:35,924 --> 00:18:37,723
and then, you know
the whole thing was over.

345
00:18:37,843 --> 00:18:40,182
Got to tell you,
a lot like having sex with you.

346
00:18:40,409 --> 00:18:43,626
Hey, I'll have you know, I've
invented some new positions since then.

347
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,327
Goodye, Gary.

348
00:18:45,455 --> 00:18:46,918
- All right.
- Look...

349
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:51,034
i'm sorry I assumed you lost the cello.

350
00:18:51,242 --> 00:18:53,052
I was certain I lost it, OK?

351
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,958
I do look good in that red dress,
don't i?

352
00:18:57,078 --> 00:18:58,088
Banging.

353
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,022
Hey, sorry about that.

354
00:19:05,184 --> 00:19:07,885
That paint order took a lot
longer than I thought it was gonna.

355
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,483
- So you called her a dude.
- Yes, I did.

356
00:19:11,148 --> 00:19:12,818
And what's the deal with your back?

357
00:19:13,189 --> 00:19:15,474
Look, OK.
I have a confession to make.

358
00:19:15,594 --> 00:19:19,415
My back is really messed up from years
of playing football and surfing AND

359
00:19:19,746 --> 00:19:22,388
painting houses,
and apparently my back locks

360
00:19:22,508 --> 00:19:25,514
up after nonstop acrobatic sex.

361
00:19:26,688 --> 00:19:28,878
What made you think you
had to do that in the first place?

362
00:19:28,998 --> 00:19:31,311
Because I didn't want you to think
I was one of these old guys

363
00:19:31,431 --> 00:19:33,175
that, you know,
couldn't keep up with you.

364
00:19:33,295 --> 00:19:35,920
Keep up with me?
I was trying to keep up with you.

365
00:19:36,211 --> 00:19:38,944
You know, I know that all divorced
guys go through a crazy time,

366
00:19:39,064 --> 00:19:41,238
but most of them at least
spread it around.

367
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:43,414
You are too much of a job for one woman.

368
00:19:46,497 --> 00:19:49,055
If you ever want to write
that on a bathroom wall

369
00:19:49,175 --> 00:19:52,727
or maybe send out a mass e-mail
to all my friends, that would be great.

370
00:19:58,015 --> 00:19:59,025
Hey, pal,

371
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,380
- how did it go?
- Good. You know, really good.

372
00:20:02,898 --> 00:20:05,616
I told her to lay off a little bit,
and you were right. Women like?

373
00:20:05,736 --> 00:20:08,368
- it you say what's on your mind. Great.
- That's great.

374
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:10,891
Tommy, your lips...

375
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:13,080
They look glossy.

376
00:20:14,521 --> 00:20:15,799
And you've got...

377
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,039
You've got glitter all over your face.

378
00:20:19,487 --> 00:20:20,249
Really?

379
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:22,566
You were making out
with her this whole time!

380
00:20:22,686 --> 00:20:24,253
Yeah!
I got lip!

381
00:20:26,482 --> 00:20:28,011
That's fantastic, buddy!

382
00:20:28,131 --> 00:20:30,464
You know, the more I told her to,
stop holding my hand,

383
00:20:30,584 --> 00:20:32,137
the more she wanted to kiss me.

384
00:20:32,313 --> 00:20:35,279
I'm really considering telling her to
stop kissing me and see where it goes.

385
00:20:36,939 --> 00:20:39,096
All right. Why don't you
slow your roll there, partner?

386
00:20:39,216 --> 00:20:42,980
Maybe just take a little time and enjoy
smelling the lip gloss for a while.

387
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:45,640
- All right. Good night, dad.
- I'll see you in the morning.

388
00:20:45,768 --> 00:20:47,750
My back is killing me.

389
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:50,310
