1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,120
Previously on The Tudors...

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,120
Now that the Queen and I have
a child, with others to follow,

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,960
the line of succession is now
firmly vested in our children.

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:10,460
I would reconcile you with your father

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,500
if you would only accept me as Queen.

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,970
I recognize no Queen but my mother.

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,800
The Princess will shortly
be given her own establishment.

8
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,140
The Lady Mary will attend and
wait on her. Katherine's daughter?

9
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,170
Yes.

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,240
We have had a great success
in the swearing of allegiance

11
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,350
in favour of your marriage to
Queen Anne, but we cannot persuade

12
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,250
either Fisher or Thomas
More to swear the oath.

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,220
There can be no compromise.
In this matter, it is all or nothing.

14
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,860
Why will you not take
the oath? In all honesty,

15
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,490
you are likely to pay the ultimate price.

16
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,200
Your sister is a very beautiful
young woman. Not as beautiful as her brother.

17
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,730
He can do whatever he wills now.

18
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,830
He has absolute power.

19
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,600
And what he has given, he can take away!

20
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,670
And what taken away, he can give back!

21
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,580
If you succeed in killing the King's
whore, you would be the beloved of God.

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,150
- I could still do it.
- Don't be stupid, Brereton. And don't act alone.

23
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,280
- What did you do to kill the baby?
- I didn't.

24
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,120
Believe me, I was so careful.
From now on, we must all be careful,

25
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,160
you especially, not to
lose the King's love,

26
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,290
or everything is lost for all of us.

27
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,360
Why does he have to cross me?
Why can his vanity be greater than a King's?

28
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,070
I love him, and I hate him!

29
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,440
I beg you earnestly
to pray for the King.

30
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,810
Tell him I died his
good servant, but God's first.

31
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,240
AHH!!

32
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,540
Amen.

33
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,510
To the faithful people of England,

34
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,350
your Holy Father offers you

35
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,880
the hand of condolence,

36
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,950
his tears of grief

37
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,050
and his anger at the martyrdom

38
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,290
of Sir Thomas More and Cardinal Fisher.

39
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,400
Their murder has shocked
the whole of Christendom.

40
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,970
It was an unpardonable sin against

41
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,770
God and our Holy Church, in whose name

42
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,170
these two great and noble men died.

43
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,040
We pray for those in England

44
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:21,280
who must continue
to live under tyranny

45
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,780
and in fear for their lives

46
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,790
and for their souls.

47
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,950
We pray the King

48
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,860
ceases to listen to evil counsel

49
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,790
and returns to obedience
and the true faith,

50
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,460
before it is too late.

51
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,830
We pray to Mary, Mother of God,

52
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,640
that England may be

53
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,970
redeemed from heresy,

54
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,840
and all its evil ways,

55
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,810
and from the clutches of the heretics

56
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,280
who even now, are leading her towards

57
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,720
destruction and damnation!

58
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,040
George Boleyn, Lord Rochford,

59
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,140
is to marry Lord Morley's daughter.

60
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,510
Yes, Your Majesty.

61
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,550
Lord Morley came to see me.

62
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,750
He cannot meet Sir Thomas Boleyn's

63
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,890
demand for a dowry of 300 pounds.

64
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,820
I assured him that I would
make up the shortfall.

65
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:39,990
Your Majesty is most generous.

66
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,900
How is your survey of the
religious houses progressing?

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,600
Majesty, the Commissioners are currently

68
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,900
examining houses in the west country.

69
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,840
There, and elsewhere, they tell me

70
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,810
they have uncovered many enormities.

71
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,640
What enormities?

72
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,610
They have found

73
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,620
the monks and many places

74
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,020
so depraved, so licentious

75
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,350
and so corrupt that your commissioners

76
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,790
already despair of
any perfect reformation.

77
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,360
For example the case of the
celebrated Hy Blood of Hailes.

78
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,800
Supposedly the blood of a saint,

79
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,200
used for healing the pilgrims who
flock there hoping for a miracle,

80
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,170
it turns out to be
the blood of a duck,

81
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,510
which the monks renew regularly.

82
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,140
Duck's blood...

83
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,580
Well, Mr. Cromwell,

84
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,090
what do you propose we do about it?

85
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,260
If Your Majesty will forgive me,

86
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,130
I think we should be looking for ways
to promote your Majesty's New Monarchy.

87
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,260
What do you have in mind?

88
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,470
One way would be through
the production of plays.

89
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,870
- Why plays?
- Plays are

90
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,340
an ideal way of setting forth,
before the people's eyes,

91
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,670
the abomination and wickedness
of the Bishop of Rome.

92
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,080
They're also a means
to demonstrate to people

93
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,980
the obedience that
as subjects they owe,

94
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,280
by God's and man's laws,

95
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,880
to Your Majesty. Good.

96
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,690
Then, I leave it to you, Mr. Secretary,

97
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,060
to finance and produce some plays.

98
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,090
We must do all we can

99
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,090
to advance our revolution.

100
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,870
<i>...that I shall
now suffer death in</i>

101
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,870
<i>and for the faith</i>

102
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,910
<i>of the Holy Catholic Church.</i>

103
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,320
- My Lord.
- Mr. Secretary. Your Grace.

104
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,930
Since Your Lordship makes no
secret of your zeal for reform,

105
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,460
we were anxious to let
you know our progress.

106
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,660
His Grace has just informed me

107
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:00,600
of an important new appointment
at Canterbury Cathedral.

108
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,700
Indeed. Dr. Simon Heyes has
been made our new Dean.

109
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,740
Dr Heyes particularly detests
the cult and images

110
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:09,280
and is determined to removed
them from the Cathedral

111
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,340
as well as introducing the new learning.

112
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,410
It's vital that we place reformers

113
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,080
in positions of responsibility
inside the Church.

114
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,650
There's bound to be a reaction to the
self-serving martyrdoms of Fisher and More.

115
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,620
Which is why I'm letting it
be known, throughout the Kingdom,

116
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,620
that if anyone hears
a friend or a neighbor,

117
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,260
criticizing the King or his
marriage or the reforms,

118
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,860
they have a duty to report it.

119
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,970
At the same time, Mr. Cromwell

120
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,800
we have a duty to
spread the good news.

121
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,110
If the New Monarchy
is about anything at all

122
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,210
then it is about liberty!

123
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,810
Liberty from old superstitions
from fear and guilt.

124
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,350
We... we are moving, my friends,
from darkness into light.

125
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,450
I'm in agreement with Your Grace.

126
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,790
Fortunately, we have a new weapon

127
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,560
to promote our ideas.

128
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,910
Oh, my Lord! What
in God's name is that?

129
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,750
It's called a
printing press, my lord.

130
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,020
And it will change the world.

131
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,600
What are you thinking of?

132
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,600
Nothing.

133
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:58,020
May I say something?

134
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,150
You know there are
many people abroad,

135
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,590
and perhaps even some
within this Kingdom,

136
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,190
who still question the
legitimacy of our daughter.

137
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,460
It's true.

138
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,530
You know it's true.

139
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,870
But there is something we can
do to change everything.

140
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,210
If Elizabeth was betrothed

141
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,580
to King Francis's youngest son,

142
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,680
the Duke of Angouleme,

143
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,910
then her legitimacy and
station would no longer

144
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,250
be questioned by anyone.

145
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,780
I agree,

146
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,620
and have already thought about it.

147
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,490
I will speak to the French Ambassador.

148
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,870
Will you come to my bed tonight?

149
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,250
<i>Dear Thomas!</i>

150
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,020
- Majesty.
- Come and stay at court.

151
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,260
I need you. I'm not going to
sign it! Go and tell them!

152
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,700
People are going to know that the
King of England is easily changeable!

153
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,830
- Is it better for a King to be feared?
- I don't want to be chancellor.

154
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,100
Or loved? You will do as I command!

155
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:27,210
- Harry. Harry. I come to offer my resignation.
- The time for Harry is over!

156
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,280
I discharge you most willingly.

157
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,080
Your head, cut off. Your body,

158
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,550
to be divided in four parts.

159
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,520
Please forgive me.

160
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,820
Hey.

161
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,490
Thomas?

162
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,640
Thomas...

163
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,280
What is it?

164
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,660
I've changed my mind.

165
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,130
I don't want to go through with it.

166
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,300
Now, now, sweetheart.

167
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,470
Every woman has a moment
of faintheartedness.

168
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,430
It's natural.

169
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,740
No!

170
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,880
You are marrying into a great family.

171
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,310
You will do it, whether you like
it or not. Do you understand?

172
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,130
Benedicto Dei

173
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,210
omnipotentis:

174
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:42,640
Patris et Filii

175
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,610
et Spiritus sancti...

176
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,750
Get on with it!

177
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,250
Amen!

178
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,720
Brethren, we are gathered here today.

179
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,300
Majesty, Sir Henry Norris.

180
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,600
Sir Henry.

181
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,730
- Your Majesty.
- What can I do for you?

182
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,670
Well as Your Majesty may know,

183
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,770
I recently became a widower.

184
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,310
And so, naturally,
I am looking to wed again.

185
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,140
And my choice has fallen

186
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,210
upon one of Her Majesty's ladies.

187
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,350
- Who?
- Lady Margaret Sheldon.

188
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,460
- You mean Madge!
- Yes.

189
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,060
Yes, I believe some
people call her that.

190
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,790
If they are familiar with her.

191
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,330
Have you made your intentions plain
to Miss Sheldon, Sir Henry?

192
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,900
No, Your Majesty. I have merely

193
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,340
admired her from a distance.

194
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,870
But I would now like
to take things further.

195
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,110
If Your Majesty can think of no...

196
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,110
impediment?

197
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,310
No. None.

198
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,380
You have my permission.

199
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:57,250
I have known you a long time.

200
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,350
I could not think of a more honest
nor a more honorable man.

201
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,420
I am deeply grateful to Your Majesty.

202
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,390
Sir Henry.

203
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,460
Your Majesty.

204
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,000
His Excellency the French Ambassador.

205
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,110
- Excellency.
- Your Majesty wanted to see me?

206
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,020
I wanted to ask
after my brother, the King.

207
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,120
His Majesty is very well.

208
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,650
Except for his hatred of the Emperor,

209
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,360
which is like a disease.
So he still wants our friendship?

210
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:42,860
Mon Dieu! He loves you above
all the princes in the world.

211
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,400
Then make to him this proposal

212
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:50,400
that his son Charles,

213
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,410
Duke of Angouleme,

214
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,810
should be betrothed to
our beloved daughter,

215
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,640
Elizabeth.

216
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,630
Who is she?

217
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,770
Jane Parker.

218
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,670
Lord Morley's daughter. He's a
distant cousin of the King...

219
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,340
But she's a girl.

220
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,310
Ha! Ha! Ha!

221
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,410
Was that funny?

222
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,520
I don't know.

223
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,860
Sweetheart.

224
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:51,800
You do love me, don't you, George?

225
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:55,700
Of course I love you.
I married you, didn't I?

226
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,870
Oh, I can't wait for tonight.

227
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,020
- What is it?
- Nothing. I...

228
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,800
Excuse me, father.

229
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,920
You're very pretty,

230
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,560
... Pretty Jane.

231
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,520
No.

232
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,520
No, please...

233
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,990
No, please.

234
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,030
Please don't...

235
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:56,810
Let us go about our other matters.

236
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,610
Now as much as King John

237
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,520
does Holy Church so handle,

238
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,120
so here I curse him with cross,

239
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:09,920
book, bell and candle...

240
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,400
I will ask God

241
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,830
to put him from His eternal light.

242
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,740
I will take him from Christ,

243
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,470
and after the sound of this bell...

244
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,710
The bell, you buggers!

245
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,210
The bell!

246
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,510
And after the sound of this bell.

247
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:41,390
I said after the sound of this bell...

248
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,660
Both body and soul,

249
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,930
I will give him to the devil in hell!

250
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,040
And meanwhile... This is a fine
piece of work, Mr. Secretary.

251
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,570
And educative.

252
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,480
I wonder who wrote it?

253
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,810
Ah, Mr. Bale.

254
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,850
He was once a priest of the old faith,

255
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,850
but seeing how things went on,

256
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,090
became a most passionate reformer.

257
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,690
You know, I think our family
never did anything better

258
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,690
than facilitate and encourage

259
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:23,100
your own rise, Mr. Secretary.

260
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,600
And I trust you never
forget that we did so.

261
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:30,740
... and Bishops,

262
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,040
will make lots and lots of money.

263
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,450
I love the Pope,
as much as I ever may be.

264
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,890
I pray thee heartily,
tell me why you do so?

265
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,890
Because I perceive well,

266
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,160
the Pope is a jolly fellow

267
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,190
A trim fellow, a rich fellow.

268
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,900
Yes, and a merry fellow!

269
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,070
He's rich in his royalty...

270
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,230
and angelic to his behold!

271
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:17,150
I've talked to the French Ambassador.

272
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,190
Francis is sending the Admiral of
France to arrange the marriage.

273
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,420
Thank you.

274
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,970
Majesties.

275
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,270
The Admiral of France is
to pay an official visit.

276
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,340
I want you to receive

277
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,610
and entertain him on my behalf.

278
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:42,140
Why him?

279
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:48,310
Surely my father would be
a much better choice.

280
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,450
I trust Your Grace
to carry out my commands.

281
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,450
I am, as ever,

282
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,960
Your Majesty's humble
and obedient servant.

283
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,100
That was unnecessary.

284
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:10,170
- He hates me.
- But he loves me.

285
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,740
As they're in latin...

286
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,340
no man can know.

287
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,480
What is it?

288
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,580
That woman is a whore!

289
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,850
She treats me worse
than I treat my dogs.

290
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,190
But then your dogs biteack!

291
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,190
If ceremonies and
superstitions from us fall,

292
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,130
then farewell monks and canons,

293
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,400
priest, friar, bishop...

294
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,630
and ALL.

295
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,710
How is Queen Katherine?

296
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,280
Alas she is very unwell.

297
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,490
She is sinking.

298
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:02,250
Not only is her
household severely reduced,

299
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,620
but she has been separated
from her daughter

300
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:08,030
for the last 4 years.
That is very cruel.

301
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,530
But her faith is astonishing.

302
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,500
And the Lady Mary?

303
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,670
While the concubine has power,

304
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,670
I fear for her life.

305
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:20,740
To the comfort of this nation!

306
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,820
Precibus et meritis beatae

307
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,860
Maria simper Virginis...

308
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,420
Lady Mary. What in heaven's
name are you doing

309
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,390
with the Princess Elizabeth?

310
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,520
She was left alone.

311
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:45,890
I took care of her.

312
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:49,860
Give her to me.

313
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,650
You left her alone.
You little fool!

314
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,450
We sup and think of those
who are no longer with us:

315
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,690
to More and to Fisher,
those martyred men.

316
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,860
God bless them.

317
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,440
I am told that many who

318
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,370
initially supported the King's reforms

319
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,170
are now forming a different opinion.

320
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,240
The terrible murders

321
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,940
of honest and faithful men
has opened many eyes.

322
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,980
I still do not blame the King.

323
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,090
He has been seduced by witchcraft.

324
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:48,250
I've always believed it,

325
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,560
and now I have proof.
- You have proof? - Yes.

326
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,860
I have befriended

327
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:57,130
a maid of Anne's bedchamber,

328
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,500
who has told me that
the harlot hides a secret.

329
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,710
She's deformed Chapuys,

330
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,670
an extra fingernail on her left hand,

331
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,780
which she is always
at great pains to conceal.

332
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,950
As well her body

333
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:16,520
is covered in moles, which is
sometimes called, the Devil's Teats

334
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,220
as you know. Now, this maid,

335
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:21,320
she swore to me honestly that
she had seen these quite plainly

336
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,490
on Anne's naked skin,

337
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,460
even though the lady constantly
seeks to cover herself.

338
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,630
My God!

339
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,700
Is it so?

340
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,600
It's is truth.

341
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,340
That is why she must die.

342
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:23,450
What is it?

343
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,020
He's having more affairs.

344
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,650
Are you sure?

345
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,160
Of course I'm sure.

346
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:35,090
Often I can't find him. No one
will tell me where he is.

347
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,600
He leaves the palace. I know that.

348
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,330
He's gone for hours sometimes.

349
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,600
I think he's got a harem somewhere.

350
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:48,470
There's a place where
he keeps his harem,

351
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,580
where he keeps his women. I know it.

352
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:53,010
Anne.

353
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,690
Something's going to happen to me.

354
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:03,760
- No!
- You know there's a prophecy.

355
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,860
Everyone knows it. The prophecy says

356
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:10,460
a Queen of England will be burned.

357
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:12,530
- Don't talk like this.

358
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,930
Nothing is going to happen to you.

359
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,040
I'm unable to give a King a son;

360
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,570
a son

361
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,880
to be the living image of his father.

362
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,010
Shhh...

363
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,950
It's all right. Everything
is going to be all right.

364
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,020
Please don't cry.

365
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,520
I love you.

366
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,590
I'll look after you, I swear.

367
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:40,130
Please don't cry.

368
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:55,340
Sir Thomas.

369
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:59,180
Mr. Secretary. What are all these?

370
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,280
Denunciations.

371
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:04,420
It is reported that a canon at Tewksbury,

372
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,950
mistakenly or otherwise, offered
prayers to Katherine the Queen.

373
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,620
Other than Anne.

374
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:13,590
Seven of his congregation
reported these words.

375
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,530
- What will you do to him?
- Nothing.

376
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,430
He's near 80 years old.

377
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,440
An absent-minded slip of the tongue

378
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,970
in such an old man
is perfectly forgivable.

379
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,510
Some of these others

380
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,380
are much more serious.

381
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:40,850
Look at these.

382
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:45,730
The tracts praising His Majesty

383
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:48,160
and his New Monarchy and
the reformation they explain.

384
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:51,730
Why the reformation is necessary

385
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,700
and the liberties and the opportunities
it would be bringing to the King's

386
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:57,070
humblest subjects.

387
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,210
It's very impressive.

388
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,810
You are to be congratulated on
your industry, Mr. Secretary.

389
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:08,050
But does it never concern you

390
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,850
that the King has taken to himself

391
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,920
an absolute power,

392
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,350
without any constraint,
to remake the law?

393
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:21,860
Is not that which pleases
the King... the law?

394
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:28,770
I was... I was only observing...

395
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:31,240
I like you, Mr. Wyatt,
and enjoy your company.

396
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:34,110
But you have a reputation:

397
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:37,110
you gamble and you whore.

398
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,910
You sail close to the wind.

399
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,350
God forbid

400
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,350
it should ever blow you onto the rocks.

401
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,630
His Excellency Philippe
Chabot de Brion,

402
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,600
Admiral of France.

403
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,640
- Your Grace.
- Admiral Chabot.

404
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,140
It is my privilege and pleasure
to welcome you and your party

405
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:09,210
to my home and to England.

406
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,240
May I present my wife,
the Duchess.

407
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:15,110
Madame. Je suis ravi
de vous connaître.

408
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:17,780
And, with your permission,

409
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:20,250
may I present my Secretary,
Monsieur Alfonse Gontier...

410
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,820
Madame. Your Grace.

411
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:25,590
And my niece,
Mademoiselle Germaine.

412
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,490
Mademoiselle. You are very pretty.

413
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:31,730
Madame. Your Grace.

414
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:38,400
So tell me, your Grace,
what are we to expect?

415
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,510
I am to entertain you and
your staff here for a few days.

416
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:42,010
Then the King invites
you to dine at court.

417
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:45,610
- Very good.
- There is one other thing:

418
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,950
I am told that Queen Anne

419
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,080
has planned a banquet in your honor.

420
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,650
And a tennis match.

421
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,560
I believe you met Her Majesty

422
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,630
once before, in Calais,

423
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,860
when she accompanied His
Majesty before her coronation.

424
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,870
I may have. But I have no
recollection of any such meeting.

425
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:13,370
And, alas, I don't play tennis.

426
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,480
Shall we?

427
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:23,020
Good morrow, John.

428
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,050
Your Majesty.

429
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,190
- Where are you going?
- Out. - Where?

430
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:33,290
Go back inside.

431
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,300
Where are you going?
I want to know.

432
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:41,600
It's none of your business.
It is my pleasure that you go back inside. Now.

433
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:44,600
Majesty.

434
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,010
Mademoiselle.

435
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,940
I like you, Excellency.

436
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:04,510
You're very clever.

437
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:07,480
But I don't like the way
your Emperor treats me.

438
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:10,720
He seems to think that,
as far as Katherine is concerned,

439
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,750
that I act out of spite,

440
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,390
or that I am being malicious.

441
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,790
But I swear it's not true.

442
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,960
I suppose I ought

443
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,890
to be content in the knowledge
that the world knows

444
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,630
the many wrongs that have
been done to me.

445
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,740
You don't approve of the changes
I'm making in this kingdom.

446
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:37,910
Cromwell intercepts
some of your letters.

447
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,050
We used to call it Humanism.

448
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,010
Wolsey, More and me.

449
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,380
We were all Humanists.

450
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,420
Most people think
I've changed, but I haven't.

451
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,020
At heart I'm still a Humanist.

452
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,690
Chapuys,

453
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,100
I promise you

454
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:00,770
that I am going to make such
a reformation in this kingdom

455
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:03,670
that I shall be
remembered eternally

456
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:06,410
throughout all Christendom.

457
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:11,310
I have no doubt what so ever

458
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,310
that Your Majesty's reign

459
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,220
will always be remembered.

460
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,460
I had planned a banquet
in his honor...

461
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:29,930
- Who?
- The French Admiral.

462
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,900
He has been here for 2 weeks already,

463
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:33,930
staying with the Duke of Suffolk,

464
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,870
and he has not yet sent me
a message of goodwill.

465
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,840
Every other French envoy

466
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,970
has always done so.

467
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,480
Neither has he requested
an audience with me.

468
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:45,380
With me, the Queen of England

469
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:49,050
and when we are discussing
the future of my own child.

470
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,480
Your Majesty should rest.

471
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:55,090
I ought to leave you... They also
tell me he has struck up an acquaintance

472
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,190
with the Imperial Ambassador, Chapuys.

473
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:00,290
Is that not extraordinary? Tell me

474
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,800
why should he do such a thing?

475
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:10,300
Why do you not say anything, Mark?

476
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:12,510
Your Majesty must forgive me.
I don't know what to say.

477
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:15,740
These matters are beyond my competence.

478
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:18,010
What am I? Only a dancing-master.

479
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:20,010
And then there's something else:

480
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,650
someone, some bitch
who probably hates me...

481
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,750
Told me that the King
has deliberately invited

482
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,720
a lot of beautiful women to court

483
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:28,790
for the Admiral's visit.

484
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,160
I mean can you believe that?

485
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:47,940
- Your Grace.
- Your Majesty.

486
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:50,180
May I present his Excellency,

487
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,240
Philippe Chabot de Brion,

488
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:54,350
the Admiral of France.

489
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:57,350
- Majesty.
- Welcome to my court.

490
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,490
Allow me to introduce my wife,

491
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:01,520
Queen Anne.

492
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:04,460
Madame.

493
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:10,830
Please, let us be seated.

494
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,500
Some wine?

495
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:49,200
Of course. Which domain does
it come from? Is it Bordeaux?

496
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:52,670
- This is English wine.
- English wine?

497
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:56,110
We have been making wine
in England since the Romans.

498
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,940
As recently as that?

499
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,020
Tr?s bien.

500
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,820
It's very fruity.

501
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,300
And strong. Like a...

502
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,070
... gladiator's sweats! Ha! Ha! Ha!

503
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:22,640
Ha! Ha! Ha!

504
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,660
Who is that gentleman?

505
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,060
My secretary, Monsieur Gontier.

506
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:52,000
I should like to
introduce him to my wife.

507
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:55,030
Excuse me.

508
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,010
<i>Enchant?, mademoiselle.</i>

509
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:09,420
<i>Majest?</i>

510
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:15,450
Your Majesty must forgive me

511
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,560
for not being able to attend
the banquet you arranged in my honor.

512
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:21,330
It was most unfortunate,

513
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,330
but His Grace the Duke of Suffolk,

514
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,430
and his charming wife,

515
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,030
have kept me a virtual
prisoner in their castle.

516
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,400
I was... how shall I say?

517
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:33,740
... imprisoned by affection.

518
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:36,810
Ha! Ha! Ha!

519
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,850
Madame? Are you amusing
yourself at my expense?

520
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:43,980
Forgive me, Monsieur.

521
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,520
I could not help laughing

522
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:50,090
at the King's proposition of
introducing your secretary to me.

523
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,690
For whilst he was finding him,

524
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,390
he met that pretty lady,

525
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:58,200
and forgot the whole thing.

526
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:03,870
Let's talk some business.

527
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,140
What instructions do you
have from your master,

528
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:47,710
with regard to the betrothal of my
daughter Elizabeth to the Duke of Angouleme?

529
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,220
His Majesty regrets that such
a proposition is impossible.

530
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:56,390
Why "impossible"?

531
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:59,060
Much as he loves Your Majesty,
the King cannot agree

532
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:01,960
to betroth his beloved son to a...

533
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:04,260
... to a bride whose legitimacy

534
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:06,800
is not accepted by
his Holiness Pope Paul,

535
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:10,240
by Holy Church itself,

536
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,870
nor even by the Emperor.

537
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:17,340
However, His Majesty,

538
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:20,780
to demonstrate his love,
proposes another match.

539
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:23,180
He would consent

540
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:25,650
to the betrothal of the Dauphin...

541
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:29,420
to Lady Mary, your
legitimate daughter.

542
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:36,300
If you do not agree to
the match, my master

543
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,530
will marry his son to
the Emperor's daughter...

544
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,000
leaving your country

545
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:43,200
isolated in Europe.

546
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:54,710
Excellence, your audience with
His Majesty is now over.

547
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:21,570
I'm sorry.

548
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,710
I have no excuses, Catherine.

549
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,850
I thought those days were behind me.

550
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,750
Perhaps human nature
can never change.

551
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,360
I swear to you it will
never happen again.

552
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:40,830
I love you too much.

553
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:43,760
I have no right to ask
you to believe me.

554
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:48,370
But it's true.

555
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:54,040
You see...

556
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:56,940
... you did make me cry, after all.

557
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:33,410
Who was she?

558
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,350
Who was who?

559
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,550
That lady you were talking to,

560
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,890
when you were supposed to be
finding Monsieur Gontier.

561
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,990
I don't know.

562
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:48,530
Is she one of your mistresses?

563
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:05,080
How many do you have?

564
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:08,810
What are their names?

565
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,180
Where do you keep them?

566
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:14,550
Someone told me that your nobles,

567
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:17,220
like Brandon, are assisting
you in having your affairs.

568
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,460
That's enough.

569
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:22,190
No.

570
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:25,730
No. You told me...
you always told me

571
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,270
that we should be
truthful with each other.

572
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,400
You said it was the
definition of love.

573
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:32,470
Then here's the truth:

574
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:36,140
you must shut your eyes and endure

575
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:38,680
like your betters have done before you.

576
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:41,780
How can you say that to me?

577
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:44,320
Don't you know that I love you

578
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:47,150
a thousand times more
than Katherine ever did!

579
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:49,160
And don't you know that
I can drag you down

580
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,260
as quickly as I raised you?

581
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:54,990
This is lucky you have
your bed already, madam,

582
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,830
because if you did not,
I wouldn't give it to you again.

583
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,840
Francis won't accept to the betrothal.

584
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,440
- Why?
- Why do you think?!

585
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:08,510
Because the Pope

586
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:10,740
and he and the Emperor

587
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:13,710
all agree she's a bastard!

588
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:17,250
And you are not my wife!

589
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:46,110
Tell me: how's your Catherine?

590
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:51,280
She's fine.

591
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:53,920
In fact... she's with child.

592
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:56,690
Ah! You're a happily married man, Charles.

593
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,390
I envy you.

594
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:04,000
Do you think the planets influence our lives?

595
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:06,030
I don't know.

596
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:09,300
I would often discuss the issue with More.

597
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:15,140
We would stand on the roof at nights,
and study the heavens.

598
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:21,250
More had a great knowledge of the stars

599
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:23,550
and how they influence our...

600
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,020
... humors.

601
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:40,230
I regret now what happened to More.

602
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,740
In some ways I wish it never happened.

603
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:51,940
But it wasn't all my fault.

604
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:56,780
Whenever my resolve weakened,

605
00:49:56,850 --> 00:49:59,790
whenever I was inclined to save him...

606
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,790
a certain person would privately

607
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:06,160
urged me on to his destruction.

608
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,070
Who?

609
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,940
You know who she is, Charles.
