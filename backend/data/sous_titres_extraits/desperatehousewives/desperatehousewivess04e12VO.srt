1
00:00:00,348 --> 00:00:02,382
Previously on...

2
00:00:02,432 --> 00:00:04,988
Lynette dallied
with temptation...

3
00:00:04,988 --> 00:00:06,481
Are you sleeping
with my wife?

4
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,550
Carlos struggled
with his new life...

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,988
I am poor, and i am blind,
and there is nothing about that

6
00:00:12,988 --> 00:00:14,140
That is your type.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,850
Bree found herself
with a new rival...

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,813
Bree, that is, like,
the best pie you've ever made.

9
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:21,335
This is not my pie.

10
00:00:22,217 --> 00:00:24,925
Okay, you caught me.
It's mine.

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,113
And susan made the best
of having houseguests.

12
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,425
Oh, and, listen,
bob and lee introduced u

13
00:00:32,425 --> 00:00:33,753
To this wonderful contractor,

14
00:00:33,753 --> 00:00:35,503
So we won't be imposing
for long.

15
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:36,628
Imposing? Who's imposing?

16
00:00:36,628 --> 00:00:38,550
You can stay
as long as you want.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,628
In a corridor

19
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,561
Of the greenwood
rehabilitation center

20
00:00:47,594 --> 00:00:49,761
Is a sign.

21
00:00:49,794 --> 00:00:54,828
It's there to remind patients
to be honest about the past.

22
00:00:57,027 --> 00:01:00,094
But orson hodge
did not notice it.

23
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:03,394
He was too busy
thinking of s past,

24
00:01:03,427 --> 00:01:07,862
Or at least the part of it
he shared with mike delfino.

25
00:01:10,661 --> 00:01:14,127
Orson thought
of the night they met-

26
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,094
The night his mother...

27
00:01:17,127 --> 00:01:20,327
Had murdered his mistress.

28
00:01:22,027 --> 00:01:24,528
He thought
of the next timehey met

29
00:01:24,561 --> 00:01:28,594
And how mike
began to recognize him.

30
00:01:32,494 --> 00:01:37,461
He thought of his mother's fear
mike would remember too much

31
00:01:37,494 --> 00:01:41,550
And her demand that orson
stop this from happening.

32
00:01:43,362 --> 00:01:45,461
He thought of how he agonized,

33
00:01:45,494 --> 00:01:47,160
But in the end,

34
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:49,728
Had still...

35
00:01:49,761 --> 00:01:52,027
Done the unthinkable.

36
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,828
Orsothen started to think

37
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:01,327
About the message
he had received from mike,

38
00:02:01,361 --> 00:02:03,628
Asking him to visit.

39
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,094
The thought
was crossing orson's mind

40
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:10,861
That mike had
remembered something-

41
00:02:10,895 --> 00:02:13,194
Something dangerous,

42
00:02:13,987 --> 00:02:16,094
When suddenly...

43
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:18,694
Orson. Come on in.

44
00:02:19,113 --> 00:02:22,461
The time for thinking
was over.

45
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:29,909
So i-I see ty have
a tennis court here.

46
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:31,394
Must be nice to get out

47
00:02:31,427 --> 00:02:34,175
And whack
a few balls around, huh?

48
00:02:34,175 --> 00:02:36,182
Why don't you sit down?

49
00:02:36,253 --> 00:02:38,128
It might make this easier.

50
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:45,503
I've been trying
to figure out all day

51
00:02:45,503 --> 00:02:47,690
Just how
i was gonna do this.

52
00:02:48,128 --> 00:02:49,471
Do what, mike?

53
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,443
Since i've come here, i've had
a lot of time to think.

54
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,613
Things are...
becoming clearer.

55
00:03:00,362 --> 00:03:02,690
I'm starting to put
some things togeth.

56
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:03,628
Oh?

57
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,044
Well, good for you.

58
00:03:07,077 --> 00:03:09,050
No, not really, orson.

59
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,316
When you hurt people,

60
00:03:15,816 --> 00:03:17,737
You gotta be accountable.

61
00:03:18,203 --> 00:03:19,738
There's no way around it.

62
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:21,612
So i have to ask you...

63
00:03:25,612 --> 00:03:27,550
Do you think
you can forge me?

64
00:03:29,828 --> 00:03:31,112
What?

65
00:03:34,937 --> 00:03:38,738
When i asked you to write
a prescription for pain pills,

66
00:03:38,738 --> 00:03:41,562
It... all i could think about
was getting my next fix.

67
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:43,359
The fact that you could have
lost your license,

68
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:46,238
Your business-All that
never even entered my head.

69
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:51,238
And i am... really sorry.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,175
Oh.

71
00:03:54,391 --> 00:03:55,300
Of course.

72
00:03:56,425 --> 00:03:58,175
No need to apologize.

73
00:03:59,378 --> 00:04:03,300
Wow. I-I feel
a million times better.

74
00:04:03,862 --> 00:04:05,437
You know, one thing
i've learned here-

75
00:04:05,487 --> 00:04:07,516
If you don't get this stuff
off your chest,

76
00:04:07,566 --> 00:04:09,316
It'll eat you alive.

77
00:04:14,484 --> 00:04:15,613
As he left,

78
00:04:15,613 --> 00:04:19,987
Orson thought only
of his good fortune and relief,

79
00:04:20,937 --> 00:04:22,594
Ignoring completely

80
00:04:22,644 --> 00:04:26,362
The feelings of guilt and shame
that were rising within him.

81
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:31,862
That was the sad thing
about orson hodge...

82
00:04:32,675 --> 00:04:34,596
He had no idea

83
00:04:34,596 --> 00:04:37,925
Just how sick he reay was.

86
00:04:49,477 --> 00:04:53,050
From the moment his doctors
had told him he was blind,

87
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,175
Carlos solis had worried
about only one thing-

88
00:04:58,487 --> 00:05:00,238
That the people in his life

89
00:05:00,238 --> 00:05:03,582
Would come to see him
as a burden.

90
00:05:05,331 --> 00:05:06,987
But as it turned out,

91
00:05:06,987 --> 00:05:10,347
His friends didn't mind
driving him to the store.

92
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,691
His neighbors didn't mind
helping retrieve his mail.

93
00:05:15,594 --> 00:05:17,438
The paper boy didn't mind

94
00:05:17,488 --> 00:05:20,612
Helping him find
his morning paper.

95
00:05:21,766 --> 00:05:23,000
In truth,

96
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,000
Everyone on wisteria lane
was more than willing

97
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,941
To help caos
adjust to fe as a blind man-

98
00:05:29,941 --> 00:05:31,988
Everyone, that is...

99
00:05:31,988 --> 00:05:33,469
But his wife,

100
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,362
Who was
quickly starting to feel

101
00:05:35,362 --> 00:05:38,000
She was the one
with the handicap.

102
00:05:38,128 --> 00:05:41,828
"And in a surprise move,
the spurs announced a trade

103
00:05:41,878 --> 00:05:44,269
That will send
perennial all-Star to the... "

104
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:45,972
Oh, jeez, gaby.

105
00:05:46,237 --> 00:05:49,268
I asked you to please fish out
all the little carrot squares.

106
00:05:49,268 --> 00:05:51,328
I did.
Well, i think you missed some.

107
00:05:51,378 --> 00:05:52,831
Could you get 'em out,
please?

108
00:06:00,515 --> 00:06:02,690
There you go. All gone.

109
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:07,175
Did you just use your hand?
Of course not. I us a spoon.

110
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,878
I'm sorry
that i'm such a handful.

111
00:06:12,878 --> 00:06:15,328
I really am trying to do
the best that i can.

112
00:06:15,378 --> 00:06:18,438
I know you are, babe.
And i know it's hard,

113
00:06:18,488 --> 00:06:21,160
And i'm gonna try to be
more sensitive to your needs.

114
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,050
Now hurry up and finish.
I have to go to the store.

115
00:06:24,613 --> 00:06:26,750
Could i go, too?
I'm bored.

116
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,878
Oh, please, carlos.
I have a million errands to run,

117
00:06:28,878 --> 00:06:30,999
And i'd do it
a lot faster without you.

118
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:32,863
Plus i'm having lunch
with the girls first.

119
00:06:32,863 --> 00:06:34,675
Oh, okay.

120
00:06:35,238 --> 00:06:37,999
Mm. Gaby, another carrot.

121
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:40,847
Just eat them.
Carrots are good for your...

122
00:06:41,156 --> 00:06:42,160
Just eat them.

123
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:52,503
Sorry i'm late. Blind husband.
You know the drill.

124
00:06:52,503 --> 00:06:54,203
Oh, gaby,
i'm so glad you're here.

125
00:06:54,253 --> 00:06:56,238
I was just about to tell
everyone to keep an eye out

126
00:06:56,238 --> 00:06:59,191
For their invitation
to the founder's ball.

127
00:07:00,109 --> 00:07:02,628
I'm sorry.
What is the founder's ball?

128
00:07:02,628 --> 00:07:04,265
You all seem so excited.

129
00:07:04,315 --> 00:07:07,063
It's a black-Tie fund-Raiser
that bree organizes every year.

130
00:07:07,113 --> 00:07:10,362
It's a lot of work, exhausting
and completely worth it.

131
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:13,140
Especially when you get your
big moment in the spotlight.

132
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,363
Bree gets to present an award

133
00:07:14,363 --> 00:07:17,815
To somebody who's done something
extraordinary for the community.

134
00:07:17,815 --> 00:07:20,613
Ooh, i say we nominate the woman
who gives edie her bikini wax.

135
00:07:20,613 --> 00:07:22,238
Ha ha ha ha.

136
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,191
So, bree,

137
00:07:24,191 --> 00:07:27,612
I've planned a few events
myself back in chicago.

138
00:07:27,612 --> 00:07:29,453
Small potatoes compared
to this, i'm sure,

139
00:07:29,503 --> 00:07:33,378
But if you could use me,
i'd love to help.

140
00:07:36,113 --> 00:07:37,425
That would be lovely.

141
00:07:40,563 --> 00:07:41,613
It would?

142
00:07:41,613 --> 00:07:43,550
Yes, of course.
Why wouldn't it?

143
00:07:45,156 --> 00:07:48,238
Nobody? Okay, i'm going in.

144
00:07:48,238 --> 00:07:51,594
Because you two would kill
each other... literally.

145
00:07:51,644 --> 00:07:52,550
It'll start
with hair pullg

146
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,313
And end with detectives
taking our statements.

147
00:07:55,363 --> 00:07:57,987
Remember the pie thing?
"Remember the pie thing"-

148
00:07:57,987 --> 00:08:00,206
Tibetan monks
remember the pie thing.

149
00:08:00,206 --> 00:08:03,188
I acknowledge that katherine
and i have had our differences,

150
00:08:03,238 --> 00:08:05,175
But we have all been
through a lot recently.

151
00:08:05,175 --> 00:08:06,675
And i would hope
that it taught us

152
00:08:06,675 --> 00:08:10,187
To put our differences aside
and be friends,

153
00:08:10,237 --> 00:08:14,050
Because that's
what's most important.

154
00:08:14,597 --> 00:08:17,050
I faced cancer and a tornado,

155
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,675
But i'm running from this.

156
00:08:32,894 --> 00:08:33,565
Hi.

157
00:08:35,425 --> 00:08:36,863
Oh, my god. Rick.

158
00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:39,191
Hi.

159
00:08:39,547 --> 00:08:40,375
How are you?

160
00:08:40,425 --> 00:08:42,863
Great, actually.

161
00:08:42,863 --> 00:08:44,050
We're great.

162
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,128
Well, you look great.

163
00:08:45,128 --> 00:08:45,999
Mm.

164
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,999
Oh. Hey, tom.
Look who's here-Rick.

165
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:52,175
I see that.

166
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,222
Table for one?

167
00:08:54,222 --> 00:08:55,456
Uh, no, thanks.

168
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:59,487
I just wanted to come by
and bring you guys...

169
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:01,050
It's barolo.

170
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,393
I just got back
from italy.

171
00:09:02,393 --> 00:09:04,050
Oh, well, that's nice.
Thank you.

172
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,425
Ah, what's the occasion? Or are
you just being a good guy?

173
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:11,988
I can't get anything
past you, huh, tom?

174
00:09:14,109 --> 00:09:16,487
Well, i...
i've got some work to do.

175
00:09:16,487 --> 00:09:17,203
Yeah, well, you know,

176
00:09:17,253 --> 00:09:19,410
I wanted to come here
and tell you guys in person.

177
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:24,675
I'm opening my own place.
Uh, you must have seen it.

178
00:09:27,391 --> 00:09:28,878
That's you?
On the corner?

179
00:09:28,878 --> 00:09:30,813
Yeah, i looked everywhere,
i swear.

180
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:32,999
But, uh,
it was the best location.

181
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,941
I'll bet.

182
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,343
Okay, look, people like
to eat in fairview.

183
00:09:37,393 --> 00:09:40,081
There's plenty of business
for both of us.

184
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,050
Hey, i remember you!

185
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,625
You ck to working here
now? Oh, no. Sorry.

186
00:09:44,675 --> 00:09:47,675
Too bad.
That osso buco of yours was-

187
00:09:47,675 --> 00:09:49,456
Really something.

188
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:53,815
Well, i got it on the menu
at my new place on the corner.

189
00:09:53,815 --> 00:09:55,410
Come check us out.

190
00:09:57,375 --> 00:10:00,690
See? Room for everyone.

191
00:10:30,925 --> 00:10:32,816
Oh! Orson, you scared me.

192
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,112
Why are you sitting
down here in the dark?

193
00:10:37,218 --> 00:10:39,425
And aren't you
a little cold?

194
00:10:39,425 --> 00:10:42,125
I had to do something.

195
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:45,188
Then you came down here and you
couldn't remember what it was.

196
00:10:45,238 --> 00:10:47,300
That happens
to me all the time.

197
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:50,500
Well, the baby is insisting

198
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:55,300
That i eat the last piece
of bree's triple-Chocolate cake.

199
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,988
If you want, we could-

200
00:10:58,734 --> 00:11:01,628
Oh, my god. You're naked!

201
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:05,175
In my kitchen where i eat.

202
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,238
Okay,
i don't hear you leaving.

203
00:11:10,063 --> 00:11:11,907
I had to do something.

204
00:11:11,957 --> 00:11:14,706
Pajamas-That's something
you could do.

205
00:11:15,813 --> 00:11:17,238
Okay, you're right.

206
00:11:17,312 --> 00:11:19,313
You're a guest in my house-

207
00:11:19,363 --> 00:11:21,312
A completely naked guest
in my house.

208
00:11:21,362 --> 00:11:22,940
I should leave.

209
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,628
Hey.
Hey.

210
00:11:27,628 --> 00:11:29,300
You were supposed
to be home at 8:00

211
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,953
To help me wrangle the kids
for bath time.

212
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:33,237
It's-It's almost 11:00.

213
00:11:33,237 --> 00:11:34,644
Sorry.

214
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:39,909
So where were you?

215
00:11:40,612 --> 00:11:42,456
You were stewing,
weren't you?

216
00:11:43,594 --> 00:11:44,690
Come on.

217
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:47,722
You're upset about rick.

218
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,266
Look.

219
00:11:49,316 --> 00:11:53,050
I'm not gonna deny
i was ticked off when i saw him.

220
00:11:53,878 --> 00:11:54,875
But i'm over it.

221
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:57,156
I'm taking this
as a challenge.

222
00:11:57,206 --> 00:11:59,768
We are gonna up our game.

223
00:11:59,862 --> 00:12:02,203
Oh, yeah? Yep. You
know what i did tonight?

224
00:12:02,253 --> 00:12:02,972
I worked on our menu.

225
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,050
We are gonna start making
our own osso buco.

226
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,550
I got a recipe
that is gonna kick his ass.

227
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,706
So you're really okay
with this?

228
00:12:10,706 --> 00:12:13,487
Yeah, i'm great.
Look at how cute you are.

229
00:12:13,487 --> 00:12:17,112
Oh?
It's growing back fast, huh?

230
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:25,878
Yeah, it's back.

231
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:33,863
Morning, susan.

232
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:39,300
Oh. Good morning.

233
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,999
Love what you're wearing.

234
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:44,281
Oh,
i hope this isn't decaf.

235
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:46,425
Got a big day ahead of me.

236
00:12:49,456 --> 00:12:50,718
All right. We don't need
to talk about it.

237
00:12:50,768 --> 00:12:52,768
Just promise me
it won't happen again.

238
00:12:52,802 --> 00:12:54,402
What won't happen again?

239
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,502
Orson, you were naked
in this kitchen last night.

240
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,735
I was not.

241
00:12:59,768 --> 00:13:01,469
You most certainly were.

242
00:13:01,502 --> 00:13:03,378
Good morning.
What's going on?

243
00:13:03,378 --> 00:13:07,999
Well, susan claims she saw me last
night au naturel. It wasn't a claim.

244
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:11,102
He was sitting rht here
without a stitch of clothing on,

245
00:13:11,135 --> 00:13:13,253
And i couldn't have cake.

246
00:13:14,601 --> 00:13:17,002
Oh, i think i know
what's going on.

247
00:13:17,035 --> 00:13:18,968
Somebody had
a naughty dream.

248
00:13:19,894 --> 00:13:21,999
Susan, i'm blushing.

249
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:25,968
No, no, no, no. No,
i did not have a sex dream.

250
00:13:26,002 --> 00:13:29,302
Susan,
it's perfectly understandable.

251
00:13:29,335 --> 00:13:31,568
Mike's away.
You're feeling a little lonely.

252
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:33,050
Naturally,
you'd project those feelings

253
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,635
Onto the nearest available
sex machine.

254
00:13:35,668 --> 00:13:36,635
Oh!

255
00:13:36,668 --> 00:13:38,469
You are such a scamp.

256
00:13:40,328 --> 00:13:43,135
I know when i'm dreaming,
and this really happened.

257
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:45,738
Why else wou i be sponging
butt prints off my sol?

258
00:13:45,738 --> 00:13:48,878
You know, susan, sometimes
i climb into a warm bath

259
00:13:48,878 --> 00:13:50,987
With a romance novel.

260
00:13:52,202 --> 00:13:54,335
Just a thought.

261
00:13:58,668 --> 00:14:01,402
You wanna give me
a hand with this?

262
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,300
Lynette!

263
00:14:12,438 --> 00:14:16,175
Gaby, since when do you come
to price warehouse?

264
00:14:16,312 --> 00:14:18,738
I'm poor now. Remember?

265
00:14:18,738 --> 00:14:21,238
I have to mingle
with the unwashed masses.

266
00:14:21,238 --> 00:14:22,344
What are you doing here?

267
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,675
Oh, i've been unwashed
for years.

268
00:14:25,441 --> 00:14:27,128
This place is huge!

269
00:14:27,128 --> 00:14:30,112
Would it kill them
to have valet parking?

270
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,097
Gaby, people don't come here
for the amenities.

271
00:14:33,097 --> 00:14:35,612
They come because
toilet paper's 3 cents a ton.

272
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:42,000
Look at all
these handicapped spots.

273
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:45,453
I mean, what a waste.
Take that guy selling oranges,

274
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,175
Put him in a vest,
stick him under an umbrella,

275
00:14:47,175 --> 00:14:48,987
And bam!
You got valet parking.

276
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:52,237
I don't know why poor people
refuse to better themselves.

277
00:14:52,237 --> 00:14:54,784
Yeah,
we're crazy that way.

278
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:55,797
I don't know why

279
00:14:55,847 --> 00:14:57,078
You're complaining
about handicapped spaces.

280
00:14:57,128 --> 00:14:59,863
Doesn't carlos have one
of those blue placards?

281
00:14:59,863 --> 00:15:01,363
No, i think you have
to have a wheelchair

282
00:15:01,363 --> 00:15:02,563
To get one of those.

283
00:15:02,613 --> 00:15:05,378
No, i'm pretty sure
the blind qualify, too.

284
00:15:13,815 --> 00:15:16,437
Mom, can i take some
of these cookies up to julie?

285
00:15:16,487 --> 00:15:18,613
Why don't you offer some
to our guest first?

286
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:21,175
Oh, no, thank you. We have
so much ground to cover.

287
00:15:21,175 --> 00:15:23,999
Now let's move on
to the flowers.

288
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:24,863
Uh, last year,

289
00:15:24,863 --> 00:15:28,500
We went with a cascade
of pink and white roses.

290
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,737
There it is.

291
00:15:29,737 --> 00:15:30,878
Exquisite.

292
00:15:31,438 --> 00:15:33,188
Well, easy enough.

293
00:15:33,238 --> 00:15:35,815
Let's just do that
again, then.

294
00:15:35,815 --> 00:15:37,457
Next?

295
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:40,613
Well...

296
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,613
If you have
a different idea,

297
00:15:43,613 --> 00:15:45,969
I would love
to hear that, too.

298
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:48,300
Well, i was thinking

299
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,487
It might be nice to do
something more unusual.

300
00:15:51,487 --> 00:15:56,171
What about an arrangement
of purple lisianthus

301
00:15:56,362 --> 00:15:59,031
With a spray
of dark berries?

302
00:15:59,797 --> 00:16:02,644
It's interesting. I can't
really picture that, though.

303
00:16:02,644 --> 00:16:04,550
Well, let me help you.

304
00:16:09,425 --> 00:16:10,941
I keep scrapbooks, too.

305
00:16:15,284 --> 00:16:18,675
My mom and mrs. Hodge are still
talking about that ball thing.

306
00:16:19,594 --> 00:16:22,393
She wants me to be a part
of the founder's court

307
00:16:22,393 --> 00:16:24,329
Or whatever they call it.

308
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:26,062
Like i want to put on
a stupid white dress

309
00:16:26,112 --> 00:16:27,578
And greet people all night.

310
00:16:27,628 --> 00:16:32,175
I know. It's so pathetic.
By the way, i'm doing it.

311
00:16:32,354 --> 00:16:34,362
Seriously? Why?

312
00:16:34,362 --> 00:16:36,129
Because i did it last year,

313
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:38,550
And it's actually kind of
hilarious and great.

314
00:16:39,391 --> 00:16:43,487
It is! It doesn't sound
great. It sounds beyond lame.

315
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,050
I don't want this to come off
the wrong way,

316
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:50,253
But you're a buzz kill.
Julie!

317
00:16:50,421 --> 00:16:53,441
Okay, you spend all of your time
cooped up in here alone,

318
00:16:53,441 --> 00:16:54,800
Obsessing over
some mysterious thing

319
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,500
That maybe happened to
your real dad or maybe didn't.

320
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,300
Look, i'm not saying
don't obsess.

321
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,675
I'm just saying maybe
you could spare some time

322
00:17:00,675 --> 00:17:03,550
To have a little fun
with your friend, too.

323
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:12,079
So this founder's thing-
It'll be fun?

324
00:17:14,112 --> 00:17:15,504
Uh, these were
the centerpieces

325
00:17:15,504 --> 00:17:18,750
From the vanover medical center
benefit.

326
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,999
The donors were blown away.

327
00:17:21,554 --> 00:17:24,020
Well, they're certainly...
assertive.

328
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:25,521
My only fear is-

329
00:17:25,554 --> 00:17:27,159
I know. I know.

330
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:30,454
Fairview is a bit more
provinci compared to chicago,

331
00:17:30,504 --> 00:17:32,738
But i think you'll find
the people here

332
00:17:32,738 --> 00:17:35,300
Have a lot more taste
than you give them credit for.

333
00:17:38,521 --> 00:17:41,488
Well, perhaps i could try
something new.

334
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:43,688
Let's go
with the lisianthus.

335
00:17:43,738 --> 00:17:48,112
Look at you! Pronouncing it
right the very first time.

336
00:17:49,238 --> 00:17:50,863
Isn't learning fun?

337
00:18:02,675 --> 00:18:03,800
Mrs. Scavo?

338
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,875
Uh, yes.
Is your husband home?

339
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:07,937
We're investigating an incident
involving vandalism.

340
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:09,238
Vandalism?

341
00:18:10,562 --> 00:18:13,362
Porter! Preston!
Get over here!

342
00:18:13,362 --> 00:18:15,675
No, ma'am. This incident
occurred two nights ago

343
00:18:15,675 --> 00:18:17,425
Near your pizzeria.

344
00:18:17,751 --> 00:18:19,816
Someone threw a brick through
a window of a new restaurant-

345
00:18:19,816 --> 00:18:22,300
A place called rick's?
What?

346
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,375
We're asking everybody
who works in the area

347
00:18:24,425 --> 00:18:27,050
If they saw anything suspicious.
I didn't go into work that night.

348
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,175
I did, but, um,
i didn't see anything.

349
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:32,394
What time did it happen? The
alarm went off at about 10:.

350
00:18:33,187 --> 00:18:34,988
Oh, i was home way before then,
around 8:00.

351
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:37,831
I came home early to help you
wrangle the kids for bath time.

352
00:18:39,488 --> 00:18:41,112
Yeah. No, he was here.

353
00:18:41,112 --> 00:18:43,206
All right, well, if you do
happen to hear anything,

354
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:45,300
Could you give us a
call, please? Absolutely.

355
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,613
Thank you.
Hey.

356
00:18:47,613 --> 00:18:50,113
Mm. Oh, oh, hey, honey.
Could you hold back a sec?

357
00:18:50,113 --> 00:18:50,894
Nope. Uh, lunch rush

358
00:18:50,894 --> 00:18:53,363
I'm already late as it is,
okay? See ya.

359
00:19:08,828 --> 00:19:10,640
Excuse me, miss.

360
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,831
Oh, hey there.

361
00:19:12,831 --> 00:19:14,175
I guess you didn't see
that big blue sign.

362
00:19:14,175 --> 00:19:18,362
This is handicapped parking.
I know. Primo spot, isn't it?

363
00:19:19,578 --> 00:19:21,375
What? I have a thingy.

364
00:19:21,425 --> 00:19:22,800
Yeah, i noticed that.

365
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,609
You don't look handicapped
to me.

366
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:27,266
I'm not. My husband is.
He's blind.

367
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:29,141
Well,
then that placard's for him.

368
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:30,438
Only he can park here.

369
00:19:30,488 --> 00:19:33,362
And how is he gonna park a car
if he can't see?

370
00:19:35,937 --> 00:19:38,300
Feeling
pretty stupid now, aren't ya?

371
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,687
Lady,
you got a lot of nerve.

372
00:19:47,737 --> 00:19:50,363
I had to park next
to the dumpster way in the back.

373
00:19:50,425 --> 00:19:53,125
Oh, don't play victim
with me.

374
00:19:53,175 --> 00:19:54,737
I have to walk in heels
all day long.

375
00:19:54,737 --> 00:19:57,050
You get to sit in a chair
and roll.

376
00:19:57,999 --> 00:20:00,503
You did not just say that!

377
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,078
You know, the quicker
i can run my errands,

378
00:20:03,128 --> 00:20:04,613
The faster i can get home
to my husband,

379
00:20:04,613 --> 00:20:06,675
Who needs me, because that's
the kind of person i am.

380
00:20:06,675 --> 00:20:09,753
W
- What are you doing? Calling the cops. You're getting a ticket.

381
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,938
Like hell i am! Give me that. Get off!

382
00:20:12,988 --> 00:20:16,222
No! You started it.
Hang it up! Ow! Get off!

383
00:20:16,222 --> 00:20:17,999
Hang it up!
Aah!

384
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,503
Hey, hey! Oh!
Is there a problem here?

385
00:20:22,503 --> 00:20:25,941
Jeez. What, is there a telethon
going on around here?

386
00:20:26,487 --> 00:20:28,500
Dude,
she took one of our spots.

387
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,363
Bitch! I had to find
street parking.

388
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:35,112
Hey, there's a secity guard over there.
Go get him. No, no, no, no, no. Wait!

389
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,562
Okay, you know what?
This is getting ridiculous.

390
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:40,300
Oh, no, no.
You're not going anywhere.

391
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,999
Hey!
Let me go!

392
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:44,362
Hey! Hey! Stop!
Let me go!

393
00:20:44,362 --> 00:20:45,818
What are you doing? Don't-
Ow!

394
00:20:48,185 --> 00:20:51,751
Well, it's official.
I'm going to hell.

395
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,562
Hi, daddy.
Hey.

396
00:20:56,612 --> 00:20:58,988
Hey, guys, would you go play
in the back for a while?

397
00:20:58,988 --> 00:21:02,253
I need to talk to your dad.
Thanks.

398
00:21:02,253 --> 00:21:03,300
Well...

399
00:21:04,813 --> 00:21:07,703
Hey. Don't they
have soccer today?

400
00:21:07,753 --> 00:21:10,566
Let me answer that question
with another question.

401
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,050
Why did you lie to police?

402
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,530
-Lynette
- And you made me lie to them,too,

403
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,170
Which brings up
another question.

404
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,300
-Did you know that perjury is,like,this whole big thing?
-I think you're overreacting.

405
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,310
No,overreacting would be if
i threw a brick through you.

406
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,110
What were you thinking?

407
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,650
Help me understand.

408
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,960
I just wento go check out how
the construction was going,

409
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,830
But i came around the corner.

410
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:45,070
I saw this giant picture
window that says "rick's. "

411
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,410
And then i realize i'm gonna
have to see that guy's name

412
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,020
Every damn day of my life.

413
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,270
Then i noticed
this pile of bricks.

414
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:56,930
Okay.

415
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,360
I know this whole
thing with rick-

416
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,970
It really caused
us some damage.

417
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,050
I know it hurt us,but we
survived it,and it's over now.

418
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,660
Now that's the thing,lynette.

419
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:11,820
It's not over.
It was never over.

420
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,770
I don't care about
rick's stupid restaurant!

421
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,130
I don't even care that he
wants to steal you from me!

422
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:20,110
Of course,he would want
to steal you from me.

423
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,540
That makes sense to me.

424
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,860
I care that he made you
act like it could be done.

425
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,880
Oh,tom.

426
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,290
He changed the
way i look at you.

427
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,010
But...

428
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:44,460
Nothing ever
happened between us.

429
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,680
You have to
believe me. Come on!

430
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,520
I am notrying to
get you to apologize.

431
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,160
I'm just explaining the brick.

432
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,270
Oh,my god.

433
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,370
You thought i was
crazy,but it wasn't a dream.

434
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,410
You're naked!

435
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,130
I didn't mean to do it.

436
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,050
Oh,really?

437
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,570
You just happened to stumble
naked into my front yard?

438
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,450
I didn't mean it,mike.

439
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,150
"Mike"? Wait.

440
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,610
Are you sleepwalking?

441
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,390
Orson.

442
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,560
Hello?

443
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,410
Susan.

444
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,500
Did you just hit me?

445
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,400
Oh,dear god!

446
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,240
Orson,you're
staying at my house!

447
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,340
There you go.

448
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,730
I have no explanation.
This doesn't happen to me.

449
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,450
I don't sleepwalk.

450
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,080
You know,it's none
of my business,

451
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:31,290
But seeing as i have seen you
naked twice in theast week,

452
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:35,030
I think i can ask,is
something bothering you?

453
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,140
I don't think so.

454
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:40,340
I mean,being out of our
house has been a little weird,

455
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,050
But i'm very comfortable here.

456
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,620
Clearly.

457
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,870
You know,when you
were out on the lawn,

458
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,500
You said something about mike.

459
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,390
Mike?

460
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,980
What,uh,what did i say?

461
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,060
Well,it was just
sort of muttering.

462
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,230
Were you having
a dream about him?

463
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,530
No. I-I don't believe so.

464
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,350
Well,maybe it's because
you just saw him.

465
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:08,840
-He must be on your mind.
-Yeah,yeah. You know what,susan?

466
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,260
I
- I think it's time for us to move out.

467
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,950
You can't. Your house
isn't finished yet.

468
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,310
No,the downstairs will
be ready next week.

469
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,290
-We'll be fine.
-Well,if you insist...

470
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,020
I think it will
be for the best.

471
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,950
Okay,but in the meantime,um,i
do have a teenage daughter,

472
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,680
So if you could...

473
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,000
Boxers?

474
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,030
Yes. Thanks.

475
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,270
Hey!

476
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,380
Come on. You've been
cooped up in this house

477
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,760
Since you got home
from the hospital.

478
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:49,710
-Let's go out and have some fun!
-No,i think i'm gonna stay here.

479
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:54,320
-I don't-I don't wanna be a burden. -Carlos,i
see handicapped people out and about all the time.

480
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,470
In fact,i met two
feisty men in wheelchairs

481
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,840
Yesterday at the mall. They
were living their lives...

482
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,230
So it's time for
you to live yours.

483
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,580
Come on. Come on.

484
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,440
I'm just dropping
off a few letters.

485
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,860
You might as well
just wait here.

486
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,280
Just picking up some vitamins.

487
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,130
I'll be quicker
if i do it myself.

488
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:40,120
I just have to drop off
a gift to my manicurist.

489
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,080
Why don't you
listen to the radio?

490
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,140
Thank you.

491
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,740
Sorry,babe. That took
a little longer than i...

492
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,620
Carlos?

493
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,400
Carlos?

494
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,100
Carlos?!

495
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:13,850
Carlos!

496
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,610
Oh,there you are.

497
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,960
Thanks,henry.

498
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,750
-Where the hell have you been?
-I was starving,

499
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,030
So i got that kid to take
me to go get a burger.

500
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,230
I don't believe this. I
was worried sick about you!

501
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,690
I'm sick of waiting here!
You promised me a fun day,

502
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,990
And all i got is a sunburn
on the right side of my face.

503
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:35,230
I'm sorry. I told you,i
had errands to run first.

504
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,350
-What's that smell?
-What smell?

505
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,990
It smells like...

506
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,960
Nail polish. Did you
get your nails done?

507
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,350
Is that what
you've been doing?

508
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,740
Excuse me. Miss!

509
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,950
Is that your aston martin
in the handicapped space?

510
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:55,290
What? Gaby,are you parked
in a handicapped spot?

511
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,010
Move it along,pops. We're
gonna be here a while.

512
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:02,320
Wait,wait,wait. Did you
get a handicapped tag?

513
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,030
To answer your earlier
question,yes,i got a manicure.

514
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,740
I'm sorry. Are we good?

515
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,980
Oh,my god!

516
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,350
You're exploiting my blindness

517
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,710
So that you can
score better parking?!

518
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,010
That's a really
mean way to put it.

519
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,620
You had me out here,

520
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:20,350
Sitting like a dog with
the window cracked open.

521
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:23,790
-You used me!
-Well,why shouldn't i get something out of this?

522
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:28,090
-You know,the blindness didn't just happen to you.
-You can't be serious.

523
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,900
Oh,you bet i am!

524
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,990
Every morning,the
toothpaste has to be

525
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,080
To the left of the
sink,because if it's not,

526
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:36,150
You can't find it,and
i have to put it there.

527
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,740
And-And sometimes- I
don't know-I'm driving,

528
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,090
Or i'm in line at the bank

529
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,310
And i think,"is the
toothpaste there?"

530
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,950
So then i have to
run home and check

531
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,920
Because i don't want
you reaching for the tube

532
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:49,580
And not being able to find
it. I just didn't think

533
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:52,790
This was how it was
all gonna tu out,carlos.

534
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,870
I didn't think that every
day for the rest of my life,

535
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:01,040
A part of me is always gonna
think,"where's the toothpaste?"

536
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,770
Can't you just leave
it in the drawer?

537
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,490
That's not the
point,you blind idiot!

538
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,480
I'm saying

539
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,620
If all i get in exchange
for this crappy situation

540
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,980
Is a nice parking spot
for my $8 manicure,

541
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,330
Then i'm taking it!

542
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,240
Who put pear slices
in the waldorf salad?

543
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,450
Guess that would be me.

544
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:36,590
Katherine,a waldorf
salad is made with apples.

545
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,760
It's tradition.

546
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,430
Yes,a musty,19th
century tradition

547
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,160
In need of some jazzing up.

548
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,970
Look,i just thought you have
so much on your mind already,

549
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,030
What with the music
and the decorations.

550
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:51,110
-The least i could do was take over the food.
-"Take over"?

551
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:54,000
What in god's name have you
done with my french onion soup?

552
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,470
Oh,it'll be fine.
I told the chef

553
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,030
Nothing is to leave that
kitchen unless i've tasted it.

554
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,420
-Katherine
-Trust me.

555
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,300
After all,

556
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,550
I've gotten tons of
compliments on the lisianthus.

557
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,160
Here,honey. Let me.

558
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,340
Thanks.

559
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,520
You're welcome.

560
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,170
Just so you know...

561
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,410
I'm sorry for what i'm
putting you through.

562
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,510
If it were anyone but
you,it wouldn't be worth it.

563
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:00,350
You ready to go to the party?

564
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,620
You tell me.

565
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:06,720
How do i look?

566
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,100
You look very handsome.

567
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,920
Thank you.

568
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,610
And you look more
beautiful than ever.

569
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,580
How do you know that?

570
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,170
Just a hunch.

571
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,150
Bup,bup,bup! Don't eat that.

572
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,180
We had a
refrigeration problem,

573
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,370
And i don't want
you getting sick.

574
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,820
Oh,dear. Well,i should
throw this dip out.

575
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,350
Thanks. It'll be
about ten minutes

576
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,490
Before i can make
up a new batch.

577
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,270
Do you mind tellinyour boss?

578
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,460
She's not my boss!

579
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:49,760
Bree! The room
is simply lovely.

580
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,110
You've outdone yourself.

581
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:52,470
Thank you,mrs. Downing.

582
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,810
Listen,when i present the
founder's award tonight,

583
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,800
-I was wondering
-Oh,dear. Has no one spoken to you?

584
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,780
-About what?
-Uh,well...

585
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:03,050
The committee has decided
that it would be best

586
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,050
If katherine mayfair
present the award this year.

587
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,370
No! That's... that's
my job. I always do it.

588
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:10,780
Oh,well,you're
already doing so much,

589
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,480
And,well,katherine
was quite insistent.

590
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:19,980
What's that?

591
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:22,970
-Oh,it's dip. The caterer just said that
-I thought we agreed.

592
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:25,770
Nothing leaves the kitchen
without me tasting it first.

593
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,150
Dig in.

594
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,020
Is everyone having fun?

595
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,410
You and kathere
did an amazing job.

596
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,360
Boy,we didn't think you
guys could work together.

597
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:57,100
Yeah,we were sure one of you
would end up killing the other.

598
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,780
You really should have
more faith in people.

599
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:06,910
Excuse me.

600
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,520
Katherine,darling,are
you okay?

601
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,940
Not really.

602
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,430
Oh. I hope there'sothing
wrong with the food.

603
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,400
Is anybody else getting sick?

604
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,830
Oh,no.

605
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,450
No,dear. Just you.

606
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,860
Maybe you should go home.

607
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:35,820
I can't. I have to present
the founder's award.

608
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,300
Oh,no one would expect you
to do that in your condition.

609
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,020
You know what?
Um,i could do it.

610
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,500
No. I can get it together.

611
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,290
Katherine,no one expects
you to be a martyr.

612
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,480
-Why don't you go home?
-I can't.

613
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,740
Why not? I'm perfectly
capable of presenting.

614
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,500
I've done it for
the last eight years.

615
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:54,780
And let's face it.

616
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,160
I mean,no one wants to
accept an award from a woman

617
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:00,540
Who looks like she should be
in line at the needle exchange.

618
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,280
This is important
to me. I'll be fine.

619
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,700
And now for the presentation
for the founder's award-

620
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,500
Ms. Katherine mayfair.

621
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,170
Thank you,mrs. Downing.

622
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:33,300
I was honored

623
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,820
When you and the other
members of the committee

624
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:38,490
Asked me to
present this award.

625
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:42,360
-"I was honored when you... " myeah,myeah,myeah,myeah.
-Bree,what's up?

626
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,520
I thought giving out
this award was your thing.

627
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,620
Used to be. Not
anymore. Things change.

628
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:50,910
This year's founder's award...

629
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:53,560
Ever since i started working
with that obnoxious backstabber,

630
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:56,600
She's done nothing but try to
take the spotlight off of me

631
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,800
And put it onto her.

632
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:03,010
Goes to my dear
friend... bree hodge.

633
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:10,080
The obnoxious backstabber
just called your name.

634
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,860
Bree has been a pillar
of the fairview community

635
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,150
For many years.

636
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:26,610
There is no better
friend than bree hodge.

637
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,520
Congratulations.

638
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,730
I know you tried to poison me.

639
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:43,070
Well,uh,

640
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:46,510
This has been an
evening full of,um...

641
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,840
Surprises. Uh...

642
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:56,280
I never would've
imagined that,um,

643
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,990
I would be recognized by
this wonderful organization...

644
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,700
Hi,andrew. Guess what?

645
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:04,230
-Ur mom just won the founder's award.
-Lynette,listen to me.

646
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,290
Oh,my god.

647
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,140
-You're not gonna believe what's going on down here.
-What? What? Is everyone okay?

648
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:10,890
Uh,yeah,yeah,yeah.
We're-We're fine.

649
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:13,190
It's rick's place
- Totally went up in flames.

650
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,710
There,uh,there are,like,three
fire trucks here.

651
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:18,690
Oh,my god! That's
horrible! How did it start?

652
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,100
I- They-They
don't know.

653
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:24,130
Okay,i-I'm gonna-I'll call
you back in about five. Bye.

654
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,020
I want to thank you so much

655
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,680
For presenting me
with this award. I...

656
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:33,850
I certainly,uh,wasn't
expecting it.

657
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:36,710
Um,we have a small city
with a great,big heart,

658
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:40,190
And i am honored
to,uh,accept this award

659
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,390
From my dear friend...

660
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,060
The photographer's asking

661
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,180
If he can get shots
of the two of us.

662
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,660
Wait.

663
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,440
I need to talk to you first.

664
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:04,110
I misunderstood the
situation,that's all.

665
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,300
Can we just leave it at that?

666
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,740
No,we can't.

667
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,480
And do you know why?

668
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:12,030
Because i thought
things were going well.

669
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,430
I was having fun with you.

670
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,740
Obviously...

671
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,550
I misunderstood.

672
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,370
So tell me,

673
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:25,680
Was there a straw that
broke the camel's back?

674
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,700
Or were you planning
on killing me all along?

675
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,620
Here's the thing

676
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,100
You need to understand
about me and my friends.

677
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,610
We each have our niche.

678
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,690
Gabrielle's the glamorous one.

679
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,060
Susan's the adorable
one. Lynette's smart.

680
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,860
Edie's... edie.

681
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:46,690
And i'm the domestic
one,the organizer-

682
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,120
The one who knows that there are
three tines on a dessert fork.

683
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,430
I'm the one who gets teased
for that. That's who i am.

684
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,700
And that's also who you are.

685
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,170
So?

686
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,790
So...

687
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,120
I don't really know how
to be friends with you.

688
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:08,750
That's a shame...

689
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:13,190
Because i understand you better
than all those other women do.

690
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,670
I know how following the rules

691
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,410
And observing
the little graces

692
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,910
Makes you feel like
you're in control.

693
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,810
We've both had days
where it was either

694
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,280
Set a beautiful table

695
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,980
Or curl up in a ball and die.

696
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,140
We're the same,bree.

697
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,420
And if you think that
means we can't be friends,

698
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,580
Then i'm sorry.

699
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,430
But it might also mean
we could be best friends.

700
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:48,060
Who knew you were
so insightful?

701
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:54,070
Isn't learning fun?

702
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,100
Terrific,everyone. Thank you.

703
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:05,410
Pictures.

704
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,670
So... did i lie? Was it cool?

705
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,010
You were right. It really was.

706
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,850
-"Thank you,julie. "
-Oh.

707
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,360
It's good to get out
of my own head,you know?

708
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:22,870
For months now,i've been
hung up on looking for my dad

709
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,970
And blaming my mom...

710
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,560
And it's gotten me nowhere.

711
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,490
I just wanna start
having fun again.

712
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,110
Thank you,julie.

713
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:35,640
There you are.

714
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,240
We wanted to get some
pictures with you. Mm.

715
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,480
Orson.

716
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:05,200
Hi. Um... listen,i
- I have a 12:00 curfew,

717
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,470
So if my mom
asks,can you just-

718
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,720
Mike?

719
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,780
No,it's julie.

720
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:16,450
Oh,you're sleepwalking.
Yeah,i heard about that.

721
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,310
I'm sorry,mike.

722
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,610
Again,not mike.

723
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:24,730
Why don't i-I get
you back to bed,

724
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:25,410
And-And
you can-

725
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,800
I'm sorry i ran you over,mike.

726
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,440
Blindness-

727
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,130
It's an affliction
that prevents people

728
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:49,500
From seeing what is
right in front of them...

729
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:54,890
Like the wives who
can't detect the jealousy

730
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,400
That consumes
their husbands...

731
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:05,390
The women unable to see
that a rival might also

732
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,960
Be a friend...

733
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,330
The men who stay oblivious

734
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,910
To the guilt that
lies deep within them.

735
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:18,280
Yes...

736
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:23,910
The world is filled with
those who cannot see.

737
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,210
The most dangerous are
the ones who stay blind

738
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,410
To the evil within
their own hearts.

739
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:36,360
How do we protect
ourselves from these people?

740
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,210
First,we have to open our
own eyes and find them...

741
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,830
Before they find us.

742
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:47,530
