Where the hell do you get off having
cancer and not telling me about it?

7
00:00:12,684 --> 00:00:13,509
Mom.

<i>Gaby married Victor.</i>

12
00:00:20,677 --> 00:00:22,496
Gaby is the smartest thing
you've ever done.

13
00:00:22,637 --> 00:00:23,894
With her bringing in
the latino vote,

14
00:00:24,012 --> 00:00:25,538
the governor's mansion's
as good as yours.

<i>While Carlos.</i>

16
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:29,178

a commitment to me?

<i>Ended it with Edie.</i>

18
00:00:31,328 --> 00:00:32,402
I am done with you.

19
00:00:34,498 --> 00:00:36,198
<i>But the search for true happiness</i>

20
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,785

<i>The first thing you should know</i>

25
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:55,217
<i>is that Edie Britt never
actually intended to die,</i>

26
00:00:57,672 --> 00:01:00,831
<i>but someone she loved
was trying to leave her.</i>

27
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,640
<i>So she planned every detail,</i>

28
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:07,729
<i>from the silk scarf she'd hang by</i>

29
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,735
<i> to the suicide note detailing
her despair.</i>

30
00:01:13,012 --> 00:01:15,015
<i>Now all Edie had to do.</i>

31
00:01:16,264 --> 00:01:17,269
<i>was wait.</i>

32
00:01:18,575 --> 00:01:20,735
<i>For her beloved to come home.</i>

33
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,120
Hey, Edie!

34
00:01:23,611 --> 00:01:25,056
I'm here to get my stuff.

35
00:01:25,255 --> 00:01:27,040
<i>You see,to hold on to her man,</i>

36
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:29,877
<i>Edie knew she'd have
to find the perfect</i>

37
00:01:30,244 --> 00:01:32,087
<i>moment to let go.</i>

38
00:01:35,951 --> 00:01:36,842
Hey,Carlos!

39
00:01:37,262 --> 00:01:38,594
<i>Sadly for Edie.</i>

40
00:01:38,927 --> 00:01:40,012
Can I talk to you?

41
00:01:40,272 --> 00:01:43,426
<i>Her timing was fatally flawed.</i>

42
00:01:44,122 --> 00:01:45,186
Mrs. McCluskey?

43
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:47,352
I need to show you something.
Come here.

44
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,421
What's this?

45
00:01:55,421 --> 00:01:56,849
Those are trash cans.

46
00:01:57,019 --> 00:01:59,180
I know they're trash cans,smart-ass.

47
00:01:59,535 --> 00:02:01,952
I'm asking what they're doing out
on a saturday night

48
00:02:02,175 --> 00:02:03,869
when the trash got picked up
on thursday.

49
00:02:08,306 --> 00:02:11,030
Fine. I will take them in.
Happy now?

50
00:02:12,107 --> 00:02:13,107
Carlos.

51
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,296

<i>to save the life of Edie Britt.</i>

55

Baby. What did you do?

56
00:02:40,734 --> 00:02:42,426
Come on,you gotta wake up.

57
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:43,595
Come on,please?

58
00:02:43,752 --> 00:02:46,953

<i>Regardless,
it's all they will think of.</i>

71
00:03:34,252 --> 00:03:37,188

along to remind them</i>

72
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:40,780
<i>that other people have secrets,too.</i>

73
00:03:45,774 --> 00:03:46,819
Carlos.

74
00:03:47,135 --> 00:03:49,382
- How is she?
- What did the doctors say?

75
00:03:49,552 --> 00:03:52,241
They 've got Edie on a ventilator,
but she's gonna be okay.

76
00:03:52,452 --> 00:03:54,991
What the hell happened?
How could she pull a stunt like this?

77
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:57,732
She left a note which
pretty much blames me.

78
00:03:58,123 --> 00:03:59,359
Sweetie.

79
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:02,516
I can't believe this is happening.
It's like mary alice all over again.

80
00:04:02,645 --> 00:04:04,429
Yes, but the good news
is she's gonna live.

81
00:04:05,003 --> 00:04:08,525
I know it's her wedding night, but
do you think we should call Gaby?

82
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:10,938
Crap.

83
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:18,795
Gaby?

84
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,803
You know,this better be one hell
of a wedding night,

85
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:22,458
considering how long
you're taking in there.

86
00:04:22,552 --> 00:04:23,676
Trust me,Victor.

87
00:04:23,894 --> 00:04:25,802
This will be a night
you'll never forget.

88
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:31,300
<i>- Let's get out of here.
- What?</i>

89
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,556
<i>I'm serious.
You,me-- just screw it all.</i>

90
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,896
Let's run away together.

91
00:04:36,587 --> 00:04:37,721
I just got married.

92
00:04:37,923 --> 00:04:40,659
There are 200 people out there
waiting for me to lead a conga line.

93
00:04:41,077 --> 00:04:43,020
You just said you don't feel
like Victor really loves you,

94
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,675
and you know I do. I've never stopped.

95
00:04:44,836 --> 00:04:46,280
I can't dump him on our wedding day.

96
00:04:46,421 --> 00:04:48,323
That's a horrible thing to do,
even to Victor.

97
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:50,814
He'll get over it,but I've never
gotten over losing you,

98
00:04:50,967 --> 00:04:52,881
and I won't let it happen again!

99
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,347
Gaby,you in here?

100
00:05:07,609 --> 00:05:10,040
I was just counting gifts.

101
00:05:11,521 --> 00:05:14,184
That's fine. I was actually
looking for that publicist guy.

102
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:15,814
You haven't seen him,have you?

103
00:05:16,641 --> 00:05:18,954
I'll give you a holler
when I need you.

104
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,773
Come on!

105
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,073
Who doesn't wear underwear
on their wedding day?

106
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:31,224
Focus, you idiot! Come on.
When are we leaving?

107
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:34,329
so we're doing this?

108
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:38,921
Great. It'll take me a few hours
to get stuff together.

109
00:05:39,192 --> 00:05:41,294
I'm gonna pick you up tonight.
Just be packed and ready to go.

110
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:42,275
Wait!

111
00:05:44,335 --> 00:05:46,504
Aren't you gonna kiss the bride?

112
00:05:53,397 --> 00:05:54,397
Finally!

113
00:05:55,332 --> 00:05:56,601
Carlos, where the hell are you?

114
00:05:56,861 --> 00:05:59,219
I'm at the hospital.
Edie tried to kill herself tonight.

115
00:05:59,474 --> 00:06:00,563
My God! Is she okay?

116
00:06:00,823 --> 00:06:03,858
I found her just in time,but obviously,
I can't come pick you up tonight.

117
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:07,377
Okay,that's all right.
I'll just take a cab and meet you.

118
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:10,448
Gaby, I can't leave Edie now.
Look,maybe in a couple weeks.

119
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,610
In a few weeks? What?
No! It has to be tonight!

120
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:16,454
Victor's in the bedroom right
now waiting to consummate.

121
00:06:17,104 --> 00:06:18,959
And Edie's on a ventilator.

122
00:06:19,201 --> 00:06:21,584
Look,you don't have to stay
with Victor. You have a house.

123
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:24,159
Okay,you know,running away with you

124
00:06:24,347 --> 00:06:26,460
on my wedding night was crazy enough.

125
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,891
But running away to be alone is insane!

126
00:06:29,227 --> 00:06:30,347
Gaby, please,

127
00:06:30,534 --> 00:06:32,262
she needs me. Can't you just wait?

128
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:35,329
No! I would rather try and
work it out with Victor.

129
00:06:40,932 --> 00:06:42,797
Gaby,are you coming to bed?

130
00:06:46,494 --> 00:06:47,816
<i>One month later.</i>

131
00:06:53,764 --> 00:06:55,467
Happy 1 month anniversary.

132
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:57,721
I didn't know we were doing this.

133
00:06:57,938 --> 00:06:59,786
We've just been so happy
the last four weeks,

134
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:01,494
I thought we should celebrate.

135
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:06,921
you are happy,right?

136
00:07:08,535 --> 00:07:09,716
I've never been happier.

137
00:07:10,567 --> 00:07:12,176
That's sweet.

138
00:07:18,018 --> 00:07:19,058
I don't believe you.

139
00:07:20,695 --> 00:07:23,271
I watch you sometimes,
and you seem very.

140
00:07:24,097 --> 00:07:25,190
disconnected,

141
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,733
like something's missing.

142
00:07:27,142 --> 00:07:28,552
Nothing is missing.

143
00:07:29,497 --> 00:07:31,632
So our life together is exactly
how you pictured it?

144
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:32,906
You've gotten everything you wanted?

145
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:33,991
Pretty much.

146
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:40,158
"Pretty much" means there is something
that you want that you don't have.

147
00:07:40,411 --> 00:07:42,415
How can I give it to you if
you don't tell me what it is?

148
00:07:42,675 --> 00:07:45,122
Susan,I swear,I am ecstatically,

149
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:49,208
beyond my wildest dreams,
lip-smackingly happy.

150
00:07:49,663 --> 00:07:50,785
You got it?

151
00:07:54,662 --> 00:07:55,937
This marriage is doomed.

152
00:08:01,622 --> 00:08:03,811
A moving van just pulled up.

153
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,565
Andrew,I'm having problems
with my strap. Could you help me?

154
00:08:07,825 --> 00:08:09,291
Look,I told you three weeks ago

155
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:11,616
I was no longer participating
in your little hoax,

156
00:08:11,804 --> 00:08:13,411
and that includes strapping you in.

157
00:08:13,643 --> 00:08:17,506
For heaven's sakes. Orson,
could you come help me,please?

158
00:08:18,263 --> 00:08:21,515
I'll remember this the next time
you want money for leather pants.

159
00:08:21,672 --> 00:08:22,987
People are gonna find out,all right?

160
00:08:23,116 --> 00:08:24,841
And then we're gonna
all look like idiots.

161
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:26,459
Well,not if we're careful.

162
00:08:26,735 --> 00:08:30,634
This isn't the 50's,okay? Teenage
girls get pregnant all the time.

163
00:08:30,793 --> 00:08:33,007
I mean,my ex-lab partner's practically
a grandmother.

164
00:08:33,518 --> 00:08:36,135
Look,this family's reputation
is already hanging by a thread.

165
00:08:36,671 --> 00:08:38,262
I mean, first people thought that your

166
00:08:38,522 --> 00:08:39,685
stepfather was a wife killer,

167
00:08:39,861 --> 00:08:41,980
then your sister takes up
with her history teacher,

168
00:08:42,109 --> 00:08:44,375
and now we're supposed to parade
a little bastard up and down the street.

169
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:46,562
We might as well sit on the porch
and play banjos.

170
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:52,668
You know,there's a moving van
next door.

171
00:08:57,366 --> 00:08:59,022
Mom,are you awake?

172
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:02,242
Okay,honey. Just give me a minute.

173
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:04,478
Give me a minute.

174
00:09:09,946 --> 00:09:11,754
My wig is gone. Where is it?

175
00:09:12,014 --> 00:09:13,005
It's on the nightstand.

176
00:09:13,157 --> 00:09:16,633
No,I'm looking at the nightstand,
and all I see are a few stray hairs

177
00:09:16,913 --> 00:09:19,804
and this sports blooper dvd
you thought would cheer me up.

178
00:09:20,698 --> 00:09:22,849
- Peyton Manning is funny.
- Mom!

179
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:24,572
Hey,I'm coming!

180
00:09:25,328 --> 00:09:28,850
Don't just sit there like a lump!
Come on! Help me look!

181
00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:30,314
God. Honey,

182
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:31,906
this is one of those moments when

183
00:09:32,046 --> 00:09:33,866
it occurs to me that
wouldn't it be easier

184
00:09:33,984 --> 00:09:35,873
if we just told everyone
that you have cancer?

185
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:38,156
- I found it.
- Look,I mean,

186
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,891
I get not wanting to scare the kids,

187
00:09:40,056 --> 00:09:41,846
but to keep all of our friends
in the dark.

188
00:09:42,022 --> 00:09:43,631
look,I can deal with the chemo.

189
00:09:43,795 --> 00:09:46,564
I can deal with people telling me
my hair has never looked better.

190
00:09:46,728 --> 00:09:50,168
But what I cannot deal with is
the pity,so we are doing it my way.

191
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,978
You were crooked.

192
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:01,762
hey,sweetie,what's up?

193
00:10:02,022 --> 00:10:04,317
There's a moving van
across the street.

194
00:10:05,796 --> 00:10:07,122
So you want it listed right away?

195
00:10:07,445 --> 00:10:09,133
And don't worry about
getting top dollar.

196
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:10,730
I want this place priced to move.

197
00:10:13,076 --> 00:10:14,275
What's going on here?

198
00:10:14,642 --> 00:10:15,850
I'm meeting with our realtor.

199
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:17,653
Gaby,you remember Gil.

200
00:10:18,703 --> 00:10:21,449
I remember telling you I wasn't
ready to sell the house yet.

201
00:10:22,265 --> 00:10:24,289
Gil,could you give us
a minute,please?

202
00:10:26,138 --> 00:10:29,450
Gaby,we agreed that after we got
married,you would sell the house.

203
00:10:29,703 --> 00:10:31,599
I still have a lot of stuff here.

204
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,467
Well,my house is over
10,000 square feet.

205
00:10:33,584 --> 00:10:34,970
I'm pretty sure there are closets.

206
00:10:35,099 --> 00:10:37,181
I'm just not in a rush to unload
this house,okay?

207
00:10:37,794 --> 00:10:39,452
This was my home.
I was very happy here.

208
00:10:39,621 --> 00:10:42,255
But we've got a new home now.
Aren't you happy there?

209
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,367
Yeah,it's a great house.

210
00:10:45,134 --> 00:10:47,099
Well,good. Then sell this place.

211
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:49,953
What are you waiting for?

212
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:55,126
I'm not waiting for anything.

213
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:58,965
Look,a moving van.

214
00:11:04,453 --> 00:11:06,323
New neighbors.What do we know?

215
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:09,290
Well, dining chairs. There's a clue.

216
00:11:09,525 --> 00:11:11,298
Yes.It proves they eat sitting down.

217
00:11:11,515 --> 00:11:13,181
No,I mean they're stickley.

218
00:11:13,447 --> 00:11:15,138
- It means they have taste.
- And money.

219
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,671
They've been remodeling for weeks.

220
00:11:17,754 --> 00:11:18,839
I wish Edie were here.

221
00:11:19,247 --> 00:11:21,224
Without her,there's no one
to give us the dish.

222
00:11:21,371 --> 00:11:24,870
Yet another illustration of the
fundamental selfishness of suicide.

223
00:11:29,684 --> 00:11:31,352
Do you think this is them?

224
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,433
My God.Katherine.

225
00:11:48,146 --> 00:11:48,995
Katherine!

226
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:51,866
Susan!

227
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,261
I cannot believe it has been 12 years.
You haven't changed a bit.

228
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,985
Well,you clearly have.
Your eyes sight's going.

229
00:12:06,978 --> 00:12:07,999
How's your aunt?

230
00:12:08,197 --> 00:12:10,439
Katherine used to live
here with mrs.Sims.

231
00:12:10,985 --> 00:12:12,285
Not very well,I'm afraid.

232
00:12:12,497 --> 00:12:14,741
That's really the reason
why we moved back.

233
00:12:15,032 --> 00:12:18,357
I didn't want poor aunt lily to spend
her final days in a nursing home.

234
00:12:18,732 --> 00:12:20,735
- That is so kind of you.
- Yeah,it is.

235
00:12:22,413 --> 00:12:25,030
And as luck would have it,
my husband found a job here.

236
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:28,492
Adam,could you wave or something?

237
00:12:29,274 --> 00:12:30,274
Hello,ladies.

238
00:12:30,502 --> 00:12:33,330
I look forward to meeting you
when I'm a little less sweaty.

239
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,958
He's a cutie.
What does he do?

240
00:12:36,218 --> 00:12:37,113
He's a doctor.

241
00:12:38,512 --> 00:12:40,379
Don't take this personally,
but we hate you.

242
00:12:41,214 --> 00:12:42,214
Mom?

243
00:12:43,114 --> 00:12:45,301
I finished unpacking my room.
Do you need any help?

244
00:12:45,768 --> 00:12:46,714
My God.

245
00:12:47,027 --> 00:12:48,554
This is not little Dylan.

246
00:12:50,024 --> 00:12:51,173
I'm Susan,Julie's mom.

247
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,350
She is gonna be so excited
to see you.

248
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:54,774
Great.

249
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:56,228
Who's Julie again?

250
00:12:56,488 --> 00:12:58,856
Honey,you remember your best
friend when you were little.

251
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:00,399
Right.

252
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:03,190
Why don't you go help your stepfather
with the last few boxes?

253
00:13:03,838 --> 00:13:04,860
It's nice meetg you all.

254
00:13:05,565 --> 00:13:07,239
What a beautiful family.

255
00:13:07,499 --> 00:13:09,408
I feel so lucky to have you
for a neighbor.

256
00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:12,578
No,I am the lucky one.
Look at my view.

257
00:13:13,224 --> 00:13:15,873
Your garden is absolutely breathtaking.

258
00:13:17,468 --> 00:13:19,752
And that pine tree in the backyard.

259
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:21,712
it's my pride and joy.

260
00:13:22,163 --> 00:13:25,263
It absolutely kills me to have
to ask you to cut it down.

261
00:13:26,657 --> 00:13:27,458
Excuse me?

262
00:13:27,603 --> 00:13:29,768
I'm sorry,but I'm not gonna
be able to grow my prize

263
00:13:29,956 --> 00:13:32,444
winning vegetables with that
tree blocking all the sunlight.

264
00:13:34,388 --> 00:13:36,435
Well, I'm sorry about your vegetables,

265
00:13:36,695 --> 00:13:38,395
but that pine shields my view

266
00:13:38,655 --> 00:13:39,756
of the purcells' backyard,

267
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:41,861
and if you had ever seen
mr. Purcell sunbathe,

268
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:44,193
you'd know exactly what
that tree means to me.

269
00:13:46,455 --> 00:13:48,634
I don't want to quarrel.
We will not touch that tree

270
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:51,033
until we have come up with
a solution to our problem.

271
00:13:53,337 --> 00:13:54,870
Curtains,perhaps.

272
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:59,959
So you're back. How fun.

273
00:14:00,471 --> 00:14:03,703
I should have a brunch so that
everyone can get to know you.

274
00:14:03,963 --> 00:14:05,807
No need. I'm having a barbecue
this saturday.

275
00:14:05,994 --> 00:14:08,259
I'm inviting the whole neighborhood.

276
00:14:08,892 --> 00:14:10,761
- You don't need to do that.
- I insist.

277
00:14:11,021 --> 00:14:13,000
I have missed Wisteria lane so much,

278
00:14:13,442 --> 00:14:16,342
and I wanna do something special
for my dear,old friends.

279
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,352
and all you lovely newcomers.

280
00:14:27,816 --> 00:14:31,073
The nice thing about this fake
pregnancy is my feet don't swell.

281
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:34,229
I mean,I'd never be able to squeeze
into these sling-backs

282
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,941
if I really was 8/12 months pregnant.

283
00:14:42,141 --> 00:14:43,867
Don't you look radiant!

284
00:14:44,326 --> 00:14:46,046
Hello, mrs. McKeever.

285
00:14:46,306 --> 00:14:47,789
I heard that you were expecting,

286
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,806
but I had no idea how far
along you were.

287
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,195
May I?

288
00:14:52,348 --> 00:14:53,540
There's no need.

289
00:14:54,398 --> 00:14:56,181
The baby's just not kicking
right now.

290
00:14:56,436 --> 00:15:00,144
Sometimes,if you give them a little
jiggle, you can get them to move.

291
00:15:00,404 --> 00:15:02,521
She doesn't really wanna
be jiggled right now.

292
00:15:02,781 --> 00:15:04,064
She's very sensitive down there.

293
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:05,524
But I'll be gentle.

294
00:15:05,784 --> 00:15:08,902
You know,in my day, mothers thought
that it was good luck.

295
00:15:09,726 --> 00:15:12,281
Perhaps I need to make my point
a little more clearly.

296
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,003
Bree,you're hurting me!

297
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,244
Is there a problem here?

298
00:15:17,504 --> 00:15:19,043
No,not at all!

299
00:15:19,228 --> 00:15:22,458
I'm just saying hello to a very
dear friend of mine.

300
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,714
Are you gonna back off now?

301
00:15:31,614 --> 00:15:32,871
Car's here,dear.

302
00:15:33,186 --> 00:15:35,112
Lovely to see you, mrs. McKeever.

303
00:15:37,407 --> 00:15:39,568
Why must old ladies always do that?

304
00:15:39,721 --> 00:15:42,019
I don't know,but you've got to
stop roughing them up.

305
00:15:46,484 --> 00:15:49,406
I'm sorry,Susan. Dr. Gorenberg just
had a patient go into labor.

306
00:15:49,576 --> 00:15:52,395
His new partner is covering for him,
if you're comfortable with that.

307
00:15:52,547 --> 00:15:54,696
Sure. I'm just here for a checkup.

308
00:15:55,464 --> 00:15:56,474
Doctor?

309
00:15:58,058 --> 00:15:59,169
Thank you.

310
00:15:59,486 --> 00:16:01,038
I'm Dr. Mayfair.

311
00:16:01,555 --> 00:16:02,555
I'm gonna...

312
00:16:04,243 --> 00:16:05,542
Hold it.Have we met?

313
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:07,594
Yes.Yesterday.

314
00:16:09,057 --> 00:16:11,182
- Your new neighbor.
- Right.

315
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:13,050
I didn't know you were,

316
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:14,968
this kind of doctor.

317
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:16,367
I sure am.

318
00:16:22,219 --> 00:16:23,353
Listen...

319
00:16:24,668 --> 00:16:25,854
Maybe this isn't--

320
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,000
Feet up, please.

321
00:16:30,868 --> 00:16:31,888
And scootch down.

322
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:43,247
It's just that it's weird, you know,
considering you're.

323
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:44,916
where'd you go?

324
00:16:49,596 --> 00:16:50,796
And relax.

325
00:16:52,972 --> 00:16:54,132
Sorry.

326
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:56,927
And relax.

327
00:16:59,161 --> 00:17:00,161
Sorry.

328
00:17:02,163 --> 00:17:03,475
And relax.

329
00:17:04,282 --> 00:17:05,282
Sorry.

330
00:17:05,466 --> 00:17:08,939
Hey, not to change the subject,
but when is Dr. Gorenberg coming back?

331
00:17:09,764 --> 00:17:10,857
Almost done.

332
00:17:13,077 --> 00:17:15,738
you know, Katherine has talked
about you for years.

333
00:17:16,392 --> 00:17:18,647
It's nice to finally put
a face to the name.

334
00:17:37,704 --> 00:17:39,621
Muriel. How are you doing?

335
00:17:39,952 --> 00:17:41,955
What's up? You look good.

336
00:17:44,392 --> 00:17:47,394
Don't try to sweet-talk me,
Lynette Scavo. I am fit to be tied.

337
00:17:47,891 --> 00:17:49,688
Did you or did you not

338
00:17:49,948 --> 00:17:51,857
volunteer to run the fund-raising gala?

339
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:54,568
Yeah. Things have been
a little weird lately--

340
00:17:54,828 --> 00:17:57,612
don't even think of wriggling
out of this,Lynette.

341
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,449
Every other third grade mom
has chaired an event.

342
00:18:00,709 --> 00:18:02,077
It is your turn.

343
00:18:04,511 --> 00:18:06,663
Okay. I'll jump right on it.

344
00:18:07,131 --> 00:18:08,749
Great. Okay.

345
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,252
See. That's where

346
00:18:12,512 --> 00:18:16,169
someone with half a brain would
have played the cancer card.

347
00:18:16,492 --> 00:18:18,417
- I can handle it.
- Like hell.

348
00:18:18,642 --> 00:18:20,601
You've been nauseous
all day from the chemo.

349
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,621
- You shouldn't even be here!
- It's my life.

350
00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:25,321
Some stupid disease is not gonna
keep me from living it.

351
00:18:25,474 --> 00:18:27,458
Besides,Parker's expecting to see me.

352
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:32,856
There. He saw you.

353
00:18:33,236 --> 00:18:35,192
We'll duck out when
the lights go down.

354
00:18:35,361 --> 00:18:37,861
He's gonna be watching for me
all day. He's one of the leads.

355
00:18:38,121 --> 00:18:39,389
He's Friar Tuck.

356
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,198
It's a thankless role.

357
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,458
Well, everything seems normal.

358
00:18:52,691 --> 00:18:54,709
But you say you've been having
irregular periods.

359
00:18:55,838 --> 00:18:59,007
You know,one month off,
two months on. That happens,right?

360
00:18:59,643 --> 00:19:01,259
Ever experience night sweats?

361
00:19:02,926 --> 00:19:06,989
Sometimes. But Mike's a big spooner.
He's like sleeping with a hibachi.

362
00:19:08,837 --> 00:19:10,469
How about hot flashes?

363
00:19:12,092 --> 00:19:13,438
I'm gonna stop you right there.

364
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,106
I am way too young for that.
Please refer to your chart.

365
00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:20,516
I know for a lot of women the word
"Menopause" has negative connotations.

366
00:19:20,804 --> 00:19:22,948
They hear "aging",

367
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,538
"brittle bones",

368
00:19:25,001 --> 00:19:26,201
"loss of sexual desire".

369
00:19:26,461 --> 00:19:28,869
Okay,before we go any further,
can I check those diplomas?

370
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,733
'Cause I would just like
to make sure that

371
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:32,916
they're not from some med
school in the Philippines.

372
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,015
Look,there's a simple blood test
we can use to find out.

373
00:19:35,168 --> 00:19:37,503
I don't need any test!
I am not old enough for menopause.

374
00:19:37,788 --> 00:19:38,588
Now I don't know

375
00:19:38,848 --> 00:19:41,619
what kind of nonsense
they taught you at

376
00:19:42,676 --> 00:19:44,135
Harvard medical school,

377
00:19:45,105 --> 00:19:45,905
class of

378
00:19:46,164 --> 00:19:47,021
97?

379
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,516
My God! I am old!

380
00:19:50,337 --> 00:19:52,185
Just give me the damn test.

381
00:19:54,823 --> 00:19:57,065
We will live in these woods
till our work is done.

382
00:19:57,499 --> 00:20:01,832
If the sheriff comes,we will drive him
away with our bows and arrows.

383
00:20:03,989 --> 00:20:05,034
You okay?

384
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:06,757
I'm feeling a little.

385
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:09,578
- <i>God save all ye merry men!</i>
- I'm fine.

386
00:20:11,172 --> 00:20:14,708
Pray that I may join your man--
band of merry men.

387
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:17,212
I am more than just a jolly Friar,

388
00:20:17,824 --> 00:20:21,131
for I can have both
a sword and an arrow!

389
00:20:21,391 --> 00:20:22,744
We must support Robin Hood.

390
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:24,587
oh,I'm gonna be sick!

391
00:20:24,826 --> 00:20:26,517
Right there with you,lady.

392
00:20:27,334 --> 00:20:29,180
All hail Robin Hood!

393
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:35,061
- Okay, let's go.
- No! It's too late!

394
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:44,884
<i>Bravo</i>!

395
00:20:47,062 --> 00:20:49,352
I'm sorry. I'll get you a new purse.

396
00:20:49,811 --> 00:20:52,078
Fine,but that wasn't my purse.

397
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,610
Hello. You have everything you need?

398
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,620
You just let me know.
Hi!Good to see you!

399
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,470
Oh,you look great!

400
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,490
Mrs.Mccluskey. Hello.

401
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:21,460
How are you? Do you remember me?

402
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:24,620
You're bess truman,right?
Of course I remember you.

403
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:28,370
If that's your way of checking if
my brain's gone all tapioca,I'm fine.

404
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,930
Sorry.

405
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,810
So I saw your kid and your
new husband. Nice catch.

406
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,240
Oh. Well,thank you.

407
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,660
I'm very eager for him to
experience life on Wisteria lane.

408
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:41,620
The times that Dylan and I spent
here were the happiest of our lives.

409
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,470
Yeah? Then why'd you
take off so suddenly?

410
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,250
You skipped town without
even saying good-Bye.

411
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,720
My,you do remember a lot,don't you?

412
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,530
Excuse me. Really must mingle.

413
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,540
I think these eggs are past their prime.

414
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:08,380
So you just shun them
and throw them away.

415
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:12,320
Well,yeah,since mayonnaise
left out in the sun can kill ya.

416
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,650
Everything okay? You
seem kinda moody today.

417
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,490
Yeah,get used to it.

418
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,530
Okay,did I do something
wrong? No.I'm sorry.

419
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,390
I'm just a little.

420
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,010
You know what? Forget it.

421
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,620
Let's eat.

422
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,730
Yoo-Hoo,Susan! We saved you a place!

423
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,830
Come on! We want you over here.Come on.

424
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,390
Oh,my God! Dylan!

425
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,520
Hi.

426
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,170
It's me. Julie.

427
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,860
Julie's the one we were talking about.

428
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:50,690
- Hi,honey!
- Hi!

429
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,690
She was your best friend.

430
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,200
Yeah,and I-I brought you a little
wcome back gift. Your favorite.

431
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,190
Oh,my goodness.

432
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,570
You remember how much
you used to love licorice?

433
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,580
I did?

434
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,330
Okay.

435
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,600
Come on. I've got some of the
old gang I want you to meet.

436
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,190
Have fun!

437
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,190
Menopause?

438
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,780
Aren't you a little young for that?

439
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,430
I know.

440
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,990
And you thought you married a vibrant woman
in her prime,and instead,you got a wife who's.

441
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,670
Dry and dusty.

442
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,970
Oh,honey.

443
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,040
No,it's--It's a
natural part of life.

444
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,830
Yeah,the part before death. Oh!

445
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,610
Look,I know that it's upsetting,but
it's really not that big a deal.

446
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,770
Yes,it is! What if you wanna have kids?

447
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,940
We agreed that we didn't.

448
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:42,910
No,you said you did.

449
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,690
I said I didn't,then
you changed your mind.

450
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,760
What if you change it back?

451
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,610
That's not gonna happen.

452
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:51,130
Listen,my last egg could be on its
way down the chute at this very moment.

453
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:55,240
If you wanna have kids,you
might wanna jump on it right now.

454
00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:00,690
All righ this is all very romantic,but
let me be clear about this,okay?

455
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:06,150
I love you,and if kids don't
happen,I'm fine with that.

456
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,590
I don't want you to be fine.

457
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,160
I want you to be happy.

458
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:14,650
All right,I'm just trying to
find a nice way to shut you up,so.

459
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,350
Yep,we're doomed.

460
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:29,420
Hey. Hey,look who's back.

461
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:32,550
Oh,my gosh. She's out of the clinic.

462
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,670
Thanks,darling.

463
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,270
- Hi!
- Hi!

464
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,760
How are you?

465
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,730
- Oh,careful--The
neck. - Oh,sorry.

466
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,960
Thank you all so much for the cards.

467
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:49,800
Sometimes it takes a near tragedy to
realize just how much you're loved.

468
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:54,480
So why don't you talk to your
friends,and I'll go unpack the car?

469
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:56,580
Oh,thanks,sweetheart.

470
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,390
I have to admit that I was.

471
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,020
A little concerned about how
you'd react when you saw me.

472
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,740
But this. Throwing me a party?

473
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,820
Well. We just all love ya.

474
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:16,750
And,Edie,you look great. Especially.

475
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,540
You know,given the circumstances.

476
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,360
You mean that I tried to hang myself.

477
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:23,480
It's okay.

478
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:25,880
The doctor encouraged
me to talk about it.

479
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:28,080
Surely not over food.

480
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:30,370
Well,Carlos and I talk
about it all the time.

481
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,500
You know,and this whole thing has
just brought us closer together.

482
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,690
We've actually talked about marriage.

483
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,720
Hello. I don't think we've met.

484
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,860
I'm Katherine Mayfair,your new neighbor.

485
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,840
Oh,Edie. It's a pleasure to meet you.

486
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,860
Welcome to my party.

487
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,160
So I hear congratulations are in order.

488
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,280
Edie just announced
you're getting married.

489
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,710
Best wishes!

490
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,880
We're not engaged.

491
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:07,440
That was just a kind of
a what if conversation.

492
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:10,170
Really? Because she thinks
you're getting married.

493
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,830
Everyone else thinks
you're getting married.

494
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,120
So,again,best wishes.

495
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,120
Gaby,the woman tried to kill
herself because I left her.

496
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,780
She's not real good with disappointment.

497
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,760
Neither am I!

498
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:22,710
You told me you wanna run away together,and
then I don't hear from you for a month!

499
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,320
That was only because I was
going through stuff with Edie,

500
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,910
But it doesn't mean that I wasn't
thinking about you constantly.

501
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,660
You were not.

502
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,030
Yes,I was.

503
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,050
Every second of every day.

504
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,770
Yeah,well,I.

505
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,250
Kind of thought about you,too.

506
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:43,150
- I need to be with you,Gaby.
- Yeah?

507
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,280
Prove it.

508
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,030
Can you get away tonight?

509
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,540
Oh,my God,are you serious?

510
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,340
Damn right I am.

511
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,520
I just have to be back by
midnight to give Edie her pills.

512
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:00,420
What?

513
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,530
If we're gonna have an
affair,we've gotta be discreet.

514
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,650
Affair?

515
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,850
I thought we were talking
about runng away together.

516
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,880
I can't do that.

517
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,920
Edie's too fragile right now.

518
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,120
That old battle-Ax is
gonna outlive us all!

519
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,690
Hey,don't talk about her like that.

520
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,840
Oh,far be it for me to speak ill
of the future mrs.Carlos solis.

521
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,120
We are not getting married!

522
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,680
Best wishes!

523
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,080
No. Absolutely not.

524
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:32,590
That's my final answer.

525
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,780
Well,talk to you later.

526
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:36,990
That was danielle.

527
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,750
Now she wants us to send
a dvd player for her room.

528
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,260
Well,that hardly seems extravagant.

529
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:44,140
You're missing the point! It's
a convent,not the four seasons.

530
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,170
You have mustard on your chin.

531
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:51,180
I mean,it's one thing to forgive bad
behavior. It's another thing to reward it.

532
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:53,860
There are consequences for her mistakes.

533
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,970
Bree! Oh,my God!

534
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,250
Are you all right?

535
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,780
Oh! No,no,I'm fine!I'm fine!

536
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,270
- You're bleeding!
- No,no,no!

537
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,260
It's just,uh--Oh,it's
a little barbecue sauce.

538
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,210
Where is Katherine's husband?

539
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,880
- He's a doctor.
- She's fine.

540
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:10,010
Adam! Adam!

541
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,320
Get over here right now!

542
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,190
Bree got stabbed in the belly!

543
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,660
Oh,my God,are you all
right? Let me take a look.

544
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,620
No,it's nothing!

545
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:19,830
Ah,uh,we were just teasing Ida.

546
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,560
- It's something we do.
- Yes.

547
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,600
Look,it's a. Trick
ba--Barbecue fork.

548
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,030
We got it at a magic shop.

549
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,560
Uh,see? Retractable!

550
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,970
Oh,my baby!

551
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,500
That's quite a trick.

552
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:39,810
Hey,let's go freak out mrs.Mccluskey.

553
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,500
He's such a scamp.

554
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,980
Psycho mom at 5:00.

555
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:54,720
You say the word,she gets
a face full of pig bones.

556
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,150
Aw,my hero.

557
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,060
I can handle her.

558
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,690
Lynette.

559
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,530
I just spoke with helen,and
imagine my surprise when she told me

560
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,430
That you'd not started on
the decorations for the gala.

561
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,850
I'm in charge of decorations?

562
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:14,670
Yes,which you would've known had
you bothered to pick up the packet.

563
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,590
I don't want to hear it.

564
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,310
Okay.

565
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,950
Piggyback,mommy.

566
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,370
I'm sorry,sweetie.

567
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,360
I'm just-- I'm just
too tired right now.

568
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:38,150
Here,honey,I'll get ya.

569
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,740
Yes!

570
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,870
Mommy has to conserve her
energy for more important things.

571
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:58,900
We are not throwing in the
towel over a minor mishap.

572
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:01,120
How many more mishaps are
we gonna get away with?

573
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:03,190
Yesterday,it was an old woman
in the macy's shoe department.

574
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,920
Today,a magic fork in the belly.

575
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:09,220
Pretty soon,this whole charade will
completely unravel,and we will be humiliated.

576
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,630
We're already in too deep.

577
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,330
We could go on a trip,tell people
you miscarried while we were away.

578
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,210
And then what would happen to the baby?

579
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,990
Well,danielle would keep it.

580
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,350
You think danielle
could raise this child?

581
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,350
Orson,you've seen her in action.

582
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,010
She's--She's shallow,and
she's--She's selfish!

583
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,240
She would ruin this child's life!

584
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,970
How can you say that?

585
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,230
Because I'm her mother.

586
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,840
And I know what I've created,and
that's the real humiliation.

587
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,320
Orson.

588
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:44,020
Is child deserves better.

589
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,830
And I know what to do now. Please.

590
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,830
Please let me try.

591
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,550
So.

592
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,690
Really,what you want is a second chance?

593
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:59,860
Well,would that be so horrible?

594
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,660
Well,then.

595
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,310
Let the charade continue.

596
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,470
- So you're bailing on me now?
- I know.

597
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,570
- The timing is terrible.
- Damn right!

598
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,050
It's three weeks before the gala.

599
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,500
I just didn't realize how tired
I would be when I took this on.

600
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,760
Oh,we're all tired,Lynette.

601
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:32,130
But some of us still manage
to honor our commitments.

602
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,330
Okay,I'm gonna be honest with you.

603
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:38,240
- I haven't been feeling that great lately.
- Oh,don't whine to me about your aches and pains.

604
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,410
I've had the sammigraine since '87.

605
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:44,070
And my knee's so bad,I can't
even use the treadmill anymore.

606
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,940
Yeah.

607
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,410
That's rough.

608
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,860
By the way.

609
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,410
I have cancer.

610
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,080
I'll give helen a call.

611
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:24,530
So I am halfway through chemo,and
my doctor is very confident

612
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:28,360
That I'm going to beat
this,so you can all relax.

613
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,230
I'm not going to die.

614
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,250
Well,not unless we kill you.

615
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,670
Damn it,Lynette. What did
we say after mary alice.

616
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,470
After Edie? Why didn't they tell us?

617
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,510
We're your friends. Why
would you shut us out?

618
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:54,600
I just liked being able to throw on my
wig and join you guys for a cup of coffee

619
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:57,520
And a good gossip
about the new neighbors.

620
00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:01,360
You know,for five minutes,I could
pretend I wasn't a sick person.

621
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:06,530
But once your friends know you're
sick,you can't pretend anymore

622
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,110
'Cause you can see
it in their eyes--

623
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,050
The fear,the pity.

624
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,610
Is that all you see in our eyes?

625
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,480
No. No,of course not.

626
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,020
You know what? Let's make a pact.

627
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:32,100
No more secrets.

628
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:38,480
From now on,we tell each other
every shocking detail of our lives.

629
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,860
- I'm in.
- Me,too.

630
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,020
You with us?

631
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,780
Absolutely.

632
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:57,450
No more secrets.

633
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:07,430
You're right. I'm not happy.Let's talk.

634
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,480
All I'm saying is I just wanna
know that I come first with you.

635
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:18,690
Sometimes I feel less like
your wife than a possession.

636
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,070
It's demeaning.
It's--It's.

637
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,750
Why are you smiling right now?

638
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,030
Because this is fantastic.

639
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,330
After weeks of shutting me out,you're
finally telling me how you feel.

640
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,480
We should do this all the time.

641
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:31,140
Well,it's hard when you're so busy.

642
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:39,950
Maybe we should go away and just
take a couple weeksr a month.

643
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,930
Let's rediscover wt it was that
made us fall in love to begin with.

644
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,940
That is a great idea. Let's do it.

645
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:48,560
How's next week?

646
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,110
Let's see here.

647
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:55,820
Well,I've got the meeting with
the school board on tuesday.

648
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,860
And the end of the month,I've got that
conference in washington--Oh,shoot.

649
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:03,280
I've got the groundbreaking
for the new civic center.

650
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:05,090
Dad's birthday.

651
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,780
Economic development forum.

652
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:09,890
How about april?

653
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,380
I can give you two whole weeks in april.

654
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,190
I'll see you later,babe.

655
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,640
Where you going?

656
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,270
To Scavo's for a few beers.

657
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,910
Can I come?

658
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,410
- No.
- Why not?

659
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:32,210
Edie,I know you've been through a lot
lately,but I can't hold your hand 24 hours a day.

660
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:37,870
If you want this relationship to
work,you gotta give me some downtime.

661
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,090
Okay,so I managed to get away from Edie.

662
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:53,010
What do you want?

663
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,660
To get you away from Edie.

664
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,460
Oh,come on. You have to remember
your boyfriend joey miller.

665
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,440
You used to chase him
around the jungle gym.

666
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,190
Really?

667
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,870
You'd think I would've gone for this
guy with the sexy finger up his nose.

668
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,480
So you don't remember any of
the kids we used to play with?

669
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:23,880
No.

670
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,870
To be honest,I don't remember
anything about living here.

671
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,580
Really?

672
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,170
So. What is your earliest memory?

673
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:40,150
I don't know if this is a memory,but.

674
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,800
For years,I've had this creepy dream.

675
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,700
I'm really little,

676
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:52,350
And there's a guy in my
room,and he tries to grab me.

677
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,890
That is creepy.

678
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,850
Have--Have
you ever.

679
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,220
Talked to somebody about it?

680
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,560
You mean like a therapist?

681
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:09,730
My old babysitter suggested
that,but my mom got mad and said no.

682
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,800
- Really?
- Yeah.

683
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,910
Then she fired the babysitter.

684
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,670
- Susan?
- I'm in here.

685
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:28,020
Uh,your front door was open.

686
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:29,650
No problem.

687
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,810
Um,what's up?

688
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:35,780
First,let me just say this is one of the
more embarrassing moments of my career,

689
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:38,580
And you have every right to hate me.

690
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:41,300
Adam,I have no idea what
you're talking about.

691
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:45,130
Well,your test results came back,and
your estrogen levels are fine.

692
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,650
You're not about to start menopause.

693
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:50,170
Really? That's fantastic!

694
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:53,160
- There's more.
- More?

695
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:56,010
You're pregnant.

696
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,710
What? Wh-What did he just say?

697
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,330
I'm pregnant?

698
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:09,100
He said I'm pregnant.

699
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:23,020
I have never been happier.

700
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,350
Well,now I believe you.

701
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:35,210
There you are.

702
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,130
I'm sorry.

703
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,460
I got in late last night.
I didn't want to wake you.

704
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:42,230
You don't have to explain.

705
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,000
I trust you.

706
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:46,610
Well,good. Yoshould.

707
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:49,500
I just wish you trusted me a bit more.

708
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,090
What are you talking about?

709
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,430
Why didn't you ever tell me
about your offshore bank account?

710
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,670
What?

711
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:04,580
Well,you know,the one in the cayman
islands with $10 million in it.

712
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,360
I miss you when you're gone.

713
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,300
Going through your things makes
me feel like you're with me.

714
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:19,250
Okay,um,I know how this looks.

715
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,680
What did you think I was gonna do?

716
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:22,480
Tell people?

717
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:26,030
Turn you in? Try to get
my little hands on it?

718
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:30,180
I don't care about money,Carlos.

719
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:32,780
All I care about is you.

720
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:38,110
That's why this relationship
is going to work.

721
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:42,650
You can trust me with your secrets,

722
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:48,050
Just like I can trust
you not to hurt me.

723
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,940
There is a certain time of morning.

724
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:06,000
It occurs after kids
have left for school

725
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:09,210
And husbands have headed off for work.

726
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:15,770
It's a time when women think of the secrets
they've been keeping from their friends.

727
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:21,190
And how shocked they would be
if the truth was discovered.

728
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:27,330
And how they'll do everything in their
power to keep that from happening.

729
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:32,690
But what of those lucky women
who have no secrets left to keep?

730
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,450
What do they think about every morning?

731
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,250
Hey!

732
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:42,090
Is something wrong?

733
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,130
It's just.

734
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,880
Dylan and I used to be best friends.

735
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,040
I mean,we did everything together.

736
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:54,000
I know. She was like a sister to you.

737
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,860
Well.

738
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:59,310
That girl that I've
been hanging out with.

739
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:03,530
And I know this is
gonna sound crazy,but.

740
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,080
That's not the same girl.

741
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:18,400
These women spend their mornings
thinking of their neighbors

742
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:22,050
And the secrets.They may be keeping.

743
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:32,860
There you are. I've been calling you.

744
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:44,140
- Is this the room?
- Yes.

745
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:48,390
Dylan's been asking me
if she can move in here.

746
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,170
So let her.

747
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:53,620
You may remember what
happened here,but she can't.

748
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,580
Doesn't matter.

749
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:59,260
- I won't allow it
- Hey,you okay?

750
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:03,180
Did we make a mistak coming back here?

751
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,840
Did we have a choice?
