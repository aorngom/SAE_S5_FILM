00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,240
Previously on desperate housewives...

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,050
Your spleen has wandered close to your heart.

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:04,720
We're gonna take it out.

4
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,590
Get your insurance figured out by then

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,030
[There was the bad news]

6
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:09,350
It's the cop I want you to talk to

7
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,500
His name is Solomon

8
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,190
???  daughter

9
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,830
[The discomforting news]

10
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:14,970
Thanks

11
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,130
Are you hiding someone in your house?

12
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,950
Tell me your secret,I'll understand

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,690
OK

14
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,020
[and the news no one should know]

15
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,980
But you tell me yours first

16
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,500
Once a month,the (???) seciety 

17
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,680
would attend a semi-formal lunch at the home of Maxine Bennett.

18
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,830
Everyone loves these elegant get-togethers

19
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,150
Everyone that is,

20
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:47,310
but a certain red headed housewive who is convinced Maxine was a liar

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,890
You see,Maxine like to brag that she did all her own cooking

22
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,120
and because each course was served promptly,

23
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,290
presented with flare

24
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,320
and it was positively mouth watering

25
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:07,070
Bree knew Maxine had had some help

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,640
and sadly for Maxine...

27
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,520
Bree intended to prove it

28
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,910
Maxine,once again,this entire lunch is just out the swirl

29
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,240
I just have to get the number of your caterer

30
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,640
What a nice compliment. 

31
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,130
No,I'm afraid this is all my doing

32
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,300
This was a triumph,an absolute triumph

33
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,770
Oh,come on,do you honestly expect us to believe 

34
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,310
that you had the time to prepare a six-course meal for ten women

35
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,830
Even I couldn't make this and have time to get ready for a party

36
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:40,020
Well,perhaps you're just not as organized as I am

37
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,740
If you excuse me

38
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,600
Bree,what's got into you?

39
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,330
I have the same recipe for English plum pudding

40
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,720
It takes six hours to prepare

41
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,210
How would you have time to make all this and everything else that we ate today

42
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,850
This's not the pudding of an honest woman

43
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,230
FBI,open up

44
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,630
What on earth...

45
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,700
looking for a Maxine Bennett

46
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,620
I'm Maxine

47
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,550
We have a warrant. This is the premier's mail

48
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,170
A warrant? I'm in the middle of a luncheon

49
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,440
Over here

50
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,730
Found her

51
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,330
Maxine Bennett,you are under arrest,

52
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,360
for involuntary servitude

53
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,320
Is this the woman who locked you up?

57
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,770
Bree,what's going on?

58
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,250
Well,I'm not sure,but I think Maxine had a slave

59
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,280
I can't believe it,I just can't believe it

60
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,890
[But Bree could,

61
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,190
you see,for her

62
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,730
,the proof was in the pudding]

Desperate housewives
Season 2 Episode 14

66
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,890
[The world is filled with unlikely friendships]

67
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,660
[Odd pairings that to the casual observer 

68
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,470
make absolutely no sense at all]

69
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,990
[But if we look closer,

70
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,360
we can see why these alliances formed]

71
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:34,420
[After all,a shared purpose can give even mortal enemies common ground]

72
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,990
Bree,

73
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,170
we have a question for you

74
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,370
Oh,what is it?

75
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,620
Well,we were just wondering,actually,we were curious about...uh...

76
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,300
What the hell is going on with you and Betty Applewhite?

77
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,210
Yeah,that

78
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,480
Excuse me

79
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,420
Well,from the day that dead body showed up,

80
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:53,290
nobody was yelling 'oh,the Applewhites are involved other than you

81
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,780
and the next thing we know,you are having Betty over for poker?

82
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,570
What???

83
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,580
She makes it sound like we are angry,we are not angry

84
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,550
I'm a little angry

85
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,700
Can we talk about this later? I have ice-cream in here

86
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,990
Bree,could this flip-flop have something to do with 

87
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,550
the fact that Daniel is dating Matthew?

88
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,600
Yeah,that would get her

89
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,380
Who told you that?

90
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,680
- Mrs. McClosky- she saw them making out in the park

91
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,980
- Eddie! - What?

92
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,850
Can't you sugar-coat a little?

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,770
I did,he had his hand down her shirt

94
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,080
Bree,we know that you have a good reason for wanting Betty to hang out with us

95
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,850
We just wondered if you could clue us in a little

96
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,550
When it comes to Betty Applewhite,I know what I'm doing

97
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,680
and you two are just gonna have to trust me

98
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,500
and if you can't do that,

99
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,890
then perhaps I've over-estimated the depth of our friendship

100
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,380
Now,if you excuse me

101
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,420
What a bitch!

102
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,270
- Eddie,can you ... - I was sugar-coating it

103
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,020
Oh,hey...none of that in ear

104
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,500
Come on,maybe if we are remind them I'm shacking up with a senior VP,

105
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,100
they'll stop killing all my pitches

106
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,770
You've only been here for a week,why don't you give yourself a break?

107
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,590
Honey,you know the ad game,

108
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,060
we got to serve amount of time before mockery kicks me into the curb

109
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,050
Look,I'm just asking you ...

110
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,600
jump in every once in a while,throw me some of the ??? on the work path

111
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,570
I can't protect you,you're gonna have to find a way to click with Ed yourself

112
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,650
And then the pig,he rubs on his stomach,and he goes...'

113
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,030
Farm Fresh Bacon? I'll make a piggy out of you too'

114
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,730
So...

115
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,530
the pig actually eats the bacon?

116
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,470
Uhuh,yeah

117
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,390
I don't see the client doing a happy dance over the whole cannibalism theme

118
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,490
Well,Tom,why don't you pitch them the other idea you came up with last night?

119
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,910
You know,the one where people love bacon so much that they wanna keep it a secret?

120
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,670
What,like a secret underground society of bacon eaters?

121
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,390
Well,like my collage fraternity where,

122
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,020
you know,everybody wanted in,but we only take the coolest guys

123
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,140
You were Greek?

124
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,670
-Alpha Tau Megon ??
- I was Phi Kappa??

125
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:10,650
You?

126
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,550
And I don't remember you happened to be that cool to play JTO

127
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,140
Look,if I had a nickle for every fi-cap 

128
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,100
that I tag 'naked' to a free way sign

129
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,140
Scavo,if you were my pledge,I'd make you my bitch

130
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,900
Oh,you think so?

131
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,970
You know what,I'm liking this whole fraternity ankle

132
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,250
Yeah,you know,let's talk about it over lunch

133
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,740
You're buying

134
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,200
Go

135
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,590
Hello,what's going on?

136
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,030
Gabrielle,I want you to meet someone

137
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,470
This is Xiao Mei

138
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,940
She's the young lady who's forced to work for Maxine Bennett

139
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,830
Oh,the slave

140
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,500
Wow,

141
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,930
looks well fed

142
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,410
The church is making arrangements for her to return to China

143
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,320
But until then,she needs a place to stay

144
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,000
So I offered her our guest room

145
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,160
Really?

146
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,280
Baby,can I talk to you for a second?

147
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,060
Oh,you nuts

148
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,560
It's only for a couple of days

149
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:25,330
Oh,this time,you are quickly becoming Father Crowley's go-to guy for charity cases

150
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,510
And that's a bad thing?

151
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,220
When he turns our house into a catholic underground ??,YES!

152
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,630
You know who you are,Gabby?

153
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,860
You are the kind of person who'd turn away Mary and Joseph from the inn

154
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,350
Well,they should've called ahead

155
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,370
Don't brush your hair at the table

156
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,930
Are you talking to me?

157
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,460
Does this mean you've finally forgiven me?

158
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,680
Why should I? You've betrayed this family and you're not even sorry

159
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,740
Don't be such a drama queen

160
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,770
If the Applewhites go to the police 

161
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,450
and tell them that your brother ran over Mrs.Solis,

162
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,610
he could go to prison.

163
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,900
How can you not understand that?

164
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,950
They won't talk about Andrew as long as you don't go to the police about Caleb

165
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,970
What does this Caleb do exactly?

166
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,540
And why on earth are they hiding him?

167
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,850
Why don't you go to Mrs. Applewhite 

168
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,430
and tell her you really need to know what's going on?

169
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,640
I bet if you were really nice,she'd tell you the truth

170
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,740
Is that what you really think,Danielle?

171
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,300
I should go to Mrs.Applewhite

172
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,410
be nice and then she'll hand over all her secrets?

173
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,970
Yeah

174
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:39,350
When I was young,my stepmother told me that I was very lucky

175
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:44,580
I possessed beauty,wit,cunning and insight

176
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,460
These four weapons all women needed to survive in the world

177
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,140
So?

178
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,160
So take good care of your looks,Danielle

179
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:58,000
You don't have any other weapons at your disposal

180
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:04,950
Hi,

181
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,570
I need an operation on my spleen,

182
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,440
and I just found out that I ran out of medical insurance.

183
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,020
Is there anyone I can sue?

184
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,950
After the ????? Launy let the policy lapse

185
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,410
Now he's in jail,and I'm gonna die

186
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,860
Susie,you are not gonna die

187
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,770
I'll get into it with the insurance company

188
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,530
No,there isn't time for you to deal with the red tape

189
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,930
My spleen is going crinin into my heart

190
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,480
I need that operation now

191
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,230
I'd loan you the money myself

192
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:34,540
But Eddie and I just plopped down our savings since ski condo

193
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,070
I don't need a loan

194
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,710
I need coverage

195
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,300
I mean what if there are complications

196
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,710
I don't have a safety net

197
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,470
...please...

198
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,210
What in the hell are you doing?

199
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,210
I'm saying a little prayer

200
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,550
Uh,for puke sake

201
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,410
What? I'm desperate here,do you have any other ideas?

202
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,660
As a matter of fact,I do

203
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,260
What you need is a husband

204
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,330
What?

205
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,010
The only way to get a good health plan 

206
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,110
is to marry into one

207
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,940
Eddie,come on

208
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,530
No,no,I think she's onto something

209
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,200
Yeah,if we find the guy with the right plan

210
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,560
you could have a sham waiting on a  Monday night,and be 

211
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,290
fully covered Tuesday morning

212
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,100
I can't believe you are actually considering this

213
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,200
The surgeon is slicing me open a week from tomorrow,

214
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,980
what other choice do I have?

215
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:25,560
All we have to do is to find a guy who's willing to marry you

216
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,320
You know,come to think of it,

217
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:37,300
a little prayer might not be such a bad idea after all

218
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:45,470
Pad,we are all here,so send the call in as soon as you get it

219
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:53,100
200 bucks says you can't do that three times in a row

220
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,400
You catch three of those,

221
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,100
200 bucks

222
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,880
What do you say there,Scavo?

223
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,460
You are on.

1
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,220
- Here we go.
- Ah-ah-ah-ah!

2
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,780
Thrown by me.

3
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,360
I'm sorry,I thought we were here to talk aboutthe farm fresh rollout?

4
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,090
They gotta be catchable,big guy.

5
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,450
You just let me worryabout the shooting.

6
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,490
Come on.

7
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,370
- that's one. 
- Guys...

8
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,070
oh!

9
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,880
Nice moves.

10
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,920
One more,big guy.

11
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,400
Guys,please... that's--all right.

12
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,960
- Ow! 
- Oh!

13
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,080
ow.

14
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,010
that wasn't even catchable!

15
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,570
Yeah,well,maybe not.

16
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,980
But it's totally worth the 200 bucks.Ahh!

17
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,360
Whoo!

18
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,120
Well,you got me.

19
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,960
You're a regularlittle monkey man!

20
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,150
Oh,I love this guy.

21
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,610
Oh. Hi.

22
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,730
Do you have to sit aroundall day?

23
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,380
I mean,shouldn't you be out experiencingwestern civilization

24
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,910
while you have the chance?

25
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,850
what are you doing?

26
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:12,930
I fix.

27
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,780
No,this is couture!

28
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,050
This rip has to be fixedby an experienced tailor.

29
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,400
You can't just...

30
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,940
holy crap!This stitching is perfect!

31
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,990
Hungry?

32
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,810
Did you make all of this?

33
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,400
Oh!

34
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,300
For me? Okay.

35
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,490
Oh,my god!

36
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,370
You like?

37
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,450
I like a lot.

38
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,870
you like that?

39
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,120
yeah,that's nice.

40
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:09,060
Do you know what they do to people in china who speak out against the government?Hmm?

41
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,520
They put themin forced labor camps.

42
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,320
Isn't that awful?

43
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,530
Mm-hmm.

44
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,540
You know what I mean?It's such a repressive regime.

45
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,820
We forgethow good we have it.

46
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,470
Yes,we do.

47
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:27,040
Don't you think xiao-mei would like it better herein america?

48
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:32,380
I mean,where she could learn about freedom and democracyand stuff?

49
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,180
Does this haveanything to do with you making xiao-meido housework?

50
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,800
What?

51
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,860
I came downstairs this morningand found her waxing the floor.

52
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,240
She told me you asked herto put on two coats.

53
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,880
Well,first of all,that was her idea.

54
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:47,500
Second of all,I can't have this conversation until you've tasted her crab puffs.

55
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,430
Oh...

56
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,190
She just got donebeing a slave.

57
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,400
I mean,she wantsto go back to china...

58
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,220
and we can't force herto stay here and be our maid.

59
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,220
Well,who's forcing her? We'll pay herwhatever she wants.

60
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,220
And the best part is,with her résum?

61
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,240
any wage will look good.

62
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,160
No way,baby. Mnh-mnh.

63
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,850
What?

64
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,610
What? What,so you don't getwhat you want, you just walk offand pout?

65
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,140
Oh,this isn't about me.

66
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,730
This is about our great nation.

67
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,550
And I have no intentionof sexually satisfying a man who isn't willing to stand up for

68
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:33,500
and help spread the ideals and values of the united statesof america.

69
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,170
And sometimes she is a little hard to stomach,but she means well.

70
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:40,810
Well,that's--

71
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,240
hi!Oh,here she is.

72
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,350
I came as soon as I got your message.

73
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,520
Is this... this is gary grantham

74
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:47,890
your future ex-husband.

75
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,550
- Wow,nice to meet you.
- Hi.

76
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,470
Okay,listen,um,I've got to meet a client. I've got to go,

77
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,440
so just talk amongst yourselves, and

78
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,990
you two makea very handsome couple.

79
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,390
Oh.Yeah.

80
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,680
Uh,- hi.- hi.

81
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,350
So do you wannaget married on wednesday?

82
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,340
'Cause thursday and fridayI'm out of town.

83
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,650
Oh! Oh,yeah. Sure,that's--wednesday's great.

84
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,940
I'm--I'm just curious...

85
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:16,150
how did edie convince youto do this so quickly?

86
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,960
Well,she explainedyour situation to me.

87
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,460
I'm sort of in needof a fake bride myself, so I figured,

88
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,960
what the heck?

89
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,620
Why would you needa fake bride?

90
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:27,020
Uh,I'm gay,and I've nevercome out to my mother.

91
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,600
- Really? 
- Yeah. 

92
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,610
At first,I justdidn't want to upset her.

93
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,890
Then she got older,she gotemphysema and diverticulitis,

94
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,430
and I started thinking,if I just kept my mouth shut,

95
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:38,020
then one day naturewould take its course

96
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,450
and we could avoid what is sureto be a very ugly scene.

97
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,480
So what changed?

98
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,710
She told me at her81st birthday party last month,

99
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:49,540
the only reason she's hanging onis to see me get married.

100
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,370
Oh. Oh,so by marrying me...

101
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:55,030
yeah,I'd get my inheritancethat much sooner.

102
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,930
No,but mostly,I wanna make sure she's happy.

103
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,050
well,you seemvery nice,susan.

104
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,500
Uh,it will be a pleasurebeing married to you.

105
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,960
Uh,likewise.

106
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,080
here,you can finishthe rest of the fries.

107
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,340
Here's your mail

108
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,450
and your pills.

109
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,170
Ugh. 

110
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,560
More pills?

111
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,390
Miss tillman?

112
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,490
Hmm?

113
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,400
Where did this come from?

114
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,190
I don't know.It was in with your other mail.

115
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,110
Get me the phone.

116
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,820
Sullivan,it's me.

117
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:02,050
I just got some news,and I need to get you involved.

118
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,750
Looks like delfino'sbeen holding out on me.

119
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,520
The next morning,bree came up with a plan

120
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,890
to get to the truth she so desperately needed.

121
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,020
As she watched the applewhites leave their house,

122
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:24,280
she thought of how much she had trusted the previous owners

123
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,430
and how much they...

124
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,890
had trusted her.

125
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,980
caleb? Is that you?

126
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,160
hi.

127
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,770
I'm bree.I live down the street.

128
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:05,380
I'm a friendof your mother'S.

129
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,290
She's not home.

130
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,380
I know. Um...

131
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,040
I came to see you.

132
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,740
- Me? 
- Yes. 

133
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,120
Your mother told meall about you and I thought it--

134
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,900
it might be nice if,um,

135
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,480
we had a little visit.

136
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:25,150
I brought yousome homemade cobbler.

137
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,400
oh,la,la,la,la,la

138
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,890

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,100

00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:44,960
Well,um,ed bet tom thathe wouldn't eat a doughnut out of the toilet.

142
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,180

00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,970

00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,810
It's gottabe fully dunked.

145
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,470
Now,I don't want the glazeto repel the water.

146
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,990
Whoa,slight delay,people.I'm requesting a scrub down.

147
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,810
Does anybody know wherethey keep the toilet brush?

148
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,790
Just for one second,okay?Just for one second.

149
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,440
Hey,I never thoughtI'd have to ask you this,

150
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,410
but are you about to eat a doughnut out of the toilet?

151
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,230
Yeah!

152
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,060
For the galveston jewelersaccount.

153
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,330
I don't care!

154
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,500
You're not gonna do this!

155
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,790
Look,lynette, you're the one who told meto find a way to click with ed.

156
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,060
Well,now we've got our thing,

157
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,000
and it's paying off for me!

158
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,110
That's because ed gets offon humiliating you.

159
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,380
Please,don't do this!

160
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,480
We're waiting,scavo!

161
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,990
This is my moment.

162
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,280
so,caleb,besides your mother and brother,

163
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:42,250
does anybody elseknow that you're here?

164
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,190
No.

165
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,700
You're pretty.

166
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,030
thank you.That's very sweet.

167
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,850
So where have you been livingthis whole time? Upstairs?

168
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,130
No.

169
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,180
I just moved upstairs.

170
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,870
My room's downstairs.

171
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,790
Downstairs?

172
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,370
In the basement.

173
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,340
You wanna see it?

174
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:36,520
Caleb,have you been down hereall these months?

175
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,360
Yeah.

176
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,230
Did your mothermake you wear those?

177
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:43,820
Most of the time.

178
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,390
Oh,my god!

179
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,910
Sweetheart,I don't understand.

180
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:55,120
Why in the world wouldyour mother treat you that way?

181
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,610
I hurt a girl.

182
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,630
A girl?

183
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,780
Yeah.

184
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,090
And then she died.

185
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,160
Oh.

186
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,740
Her name was melanie.

187
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,460
She was pretty.

188
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,570
Just like you.

189
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,680
Hi.

190
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:39,760
I thought you should know,I'm getting married.

191
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,280
To the doctor?

192
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,630
No! No. Ha!

193
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,560
No,to--to a gay guy.

194
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,320
How did you knowabout the doctor?

195
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,370
People talk. So you--

196
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,500
you're marrying a gay guy?

197
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,840
I need health insurance,

198
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:57,750
um,'cause I've gotthis wandering spleen and...

199
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,440
that sounds funny, "spleen wandering," but...

200
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,400
actually,it's not funny 'causeit can bang into things...

201
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,100
so I need health insurance,so I'm getting married tomorrow.

202
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,990
And you probably thinkI'm crazy,right?

203
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,780
Well... can it wait?

204
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,630
Um,the surgery?

205
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,930
No. 

206
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,830
It can't wait.

207
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,510
I guess it's really not that crazy.

208
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,480
how you doin',ma'am?

209
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,420
Susan,can you justgive me a minute?

210
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,680
Oh,yeah.No,I'm sorry.

211
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,830
I--that was really... it.

212
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:33,850
What do you want?

213
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,650
It's not what i want,delfino.

214
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,720
It's whatnoah taylor wants.

215
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,670
Where's his grandkid?

216
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:44,330
You know,let's skip the part where you don't knowanything about anything.

217
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,920
Mr. Taylor wants to chat.

218
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,160
What if I say no?

219
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:51,050
Then I've gottafind the kid myself,

220
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,620
and my guess is,he or she issomewhere around here close.

221
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,160
Your old girlfriend--

222
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,230
she's got a daughter,right?

223
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,320
Maybe I should startby paying her a visit...

224
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,900
her daughter's not the one.

225
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,620
Yeah,well,given your track record,

226
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,690
I might wanna check that outfor myself.

227
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,960
Tell him I'll be therein the morning.

228
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,380
Oh!

229
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,900
So pretty.

230
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,700
You like nice things?

231
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,620
that's why I think you're stupid,

232
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,760
for not wanting to stay here.

233
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,670
You could be around my nice things all the time,

234
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,030
taking care of them...

235
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,310
how fun would that be?

236
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,770
Well,I'm sure it's a lotmore fun than you'd have in that 

237
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:50,750
tiny,godforsaken village of yours.

238
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:57,400
You know,we're probably more alike than people would guess.

239
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,270
I'm from a small town,too.

240
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,330
My folks had nothing.

241
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,300
That's why I love america.

242
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,300
Anything is possible.

243
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,150
Oh...

244
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,340
hmm,you like that?

245
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,490
No.

246
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,130
An old,fat stockbrokergave this to me.

247
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,840
It's not worth anything.You can have it.

248
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,390
Oh...

249
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,080
oh!

250
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:37,440
It's okay.Glad you like it.

251
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,610
You can brush my hair.

252
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,760
Oh!

253
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,810
- Hi. 
- Hi.

254
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:02,540
Uh,this is the bestI could do on such short notice.

255
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,780
- Okay. - Okay.

256
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,520
Oh,uh,susan,this is,uh,my best man,steven.

257
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,750
He's also my life partner.

258
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,980
Oh,hi.It's nice to meet you.

259
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,800
Baby,be--be nice.Come on.

260
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:27,030
I'm sorry you have cancer.

261
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,610
Cancer?

262
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:31,730
Isn't that the pointof this whole charade?

263
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,810
Gary saidyou needed insurance.

264
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,960
Oh,yes. No,no,I do need insurance.

265
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,190
I just don't have cancer.I have A... 

266
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,470
wandering spleen.

267
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,840
I saidit was like cancer.

268
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,450
Is there a problem?

269
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,350
No.No,everything's fine.

270
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,260
Uh,let's just go to the chapel.

271
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,390
Shall we?

272
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,690
I made a wedding cake.

273
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,230
I hope you enjoy it.

274
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,970
Oh! Uh...

275
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:06,130
so... are we ready to get started?

276
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,830
Oh,do you havea thing to play music?

277
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:10,560
I had steven burn a little wedding mix for us,.

278
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,510
for ambience

279
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,810
Sure,just,um,give me a sec

280
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,090
do you have a problem?

281
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,890
You said she was sick.

282
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,320
She is.

283
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,090
She has a wandering spleen.

284
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,870
It sounds nothing like cancer. It doesn't even sound real.

285
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,790
Well,it is. I-I could die.

286
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,070
You look fine to me,honey.

287
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,280
Don't do this.

288
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,170
I have asked you six times to fly with me to holland to get married,

289
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,200
and you always havesome la me excuse.

290
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,760
But the second some chick witha silly disease comes along,

291
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,000
well,you drop everythingand head for a chapel.

292
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,570
Oh,no,it's a serious illness.

293
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:50,950
See,it just sounds silly'cause of the word "spleen."

294
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,380
What do you want from me?

295
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:56,180
I want you to worryabout my feelings half as much as you worry about your mother's!

296
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,840
What is it gonna taketo make you happy?

297
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,350
Not go through with the wedding?

298
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,150
Is that what you're asking?

299
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,120
Oh,oh! No,no,stop right there.

300
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:06,740
Okay,I would love to see you two crazy kids get hitched in holland more than anyone,

301
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:10,790
with the tulips and the clogs,in front of a windmill,the whole shebang.

302
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,640
But unless I get this surgery,

303
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,280
my spleen is going to slam straight into my heartand explode.

304
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:19,030
So,you know,seeingas I am just a nice person

305
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,290
and I always support gay rights,let's just do this.

306
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,630
And then I'll havea husband and insurance.

307
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,960
Nobody gets hurt.

308
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,730
Steven,why...steven!

309
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,680
- it's just... 
- yeah.

310
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:41,580
I'm so sorry.

311
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:42,740
My hands are tied.

312
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,710
I'm really sorry.

313
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:50,850
Steven,wait. Steven... where are you going?

314
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:57,760
what's love got to do,got to do with it?

315
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,700
Ah,finally gotthe sound system working.

316
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:04,170
Where's the groom?

317
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,690
Hey,susie Q.

318
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,930
What's wrong? For a newlywed,you don't havemuch spring in your step.

319
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,390
I didn't get married.

320
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,930
Really?

321
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:32,880
We got to the altar, but the whole fake wedding thingsort of imploded.

322
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:37,550
Wow. I'm sorry.

323
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,170
I still don't haveinsurance.

324
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,680
I need to getthat operation. I'M...

325
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,460
I'm really screwed.

326
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,460
well...

327
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,860
why don't I justmarry you?

328
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,490
What?

329
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,230
I've gota fantastic health plan.

330
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,230
You'd be coveredinstantly.

331
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:05,230
But... we wereactually married.

332
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:10,250
Look,susie,I've always felt awful about walking out on youthe way I did.

333
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,250
And I figure,if we do this,

334
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,580
I'd basicallybe saving your life.

335
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,380
I figure I owe you one.

336
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,760
Karl...

337
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,800
so what do you say?

338
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:31,090
Will you marry me,susan mayer?

339
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,320
again?

340
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,640
What the hell?

341
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,290
cool!

342
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:47,820
what are we gonnado about edie?

343
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,620
- We can't tell her.
- She'd kill us both.

344
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,270
Yeah,it'll beour little secret.

345
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,910
We've really enjoyedhaving you as a guest. Right,gaby?

346
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,450
Absolutely.

347
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:03,300
Xiao-mei,you are a very special girl, so...

348
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:06,470
so you take care,okay?

349
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,520
Oh!

350
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,800
hanks forall your help,carlos.

351
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:18,100
my pleasure,father.

352
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,720
- Bye-bye. - Ladies?

353
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,220
please don't tell me you're crying

354
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,140
just because you can'thave the maid you want.

355
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:32,850
Carlos,she wouldn'thave been just a maid.

356
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,390
She would have been the best damn maid ever.

357
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,150
God,you're pathetic.

358
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,820
Shut up.

359
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,150
hey,

360
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,510
something's going on.

361
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:53,880
is there a problem?

362
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,060
Well,xiao-mei doesn't wantto go back to china.

363
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:58,830
She wants to stay hereand work for you.

364
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,370
What? Why?

365
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:10,910
she says mrs. Solistreated her with more kindness than she's ever known.

366
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:14,690
She now thinks of you twoas family.

367
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:17,410
Oh,really?

368
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,910
Oh,of courseyou can stay!

369
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,570
Oh!

370
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,640
gaby...

371
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,630
carlos,she thinks of us as family.

372
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,380
I'm ready to hearthose farm fresh concepts.

373
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,960
Conference room in five... 

374
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,200
toilet boy!

375
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,830
you are so not allowedto complain to me.

376
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,640
I know. You were right,okay?

377
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,670
So now I'm known throughout the advertising worldas "toilet boy."

378
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,230
Tell him you're donewith the games.

379
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,800
You don't wanna playanymore.

380
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,220
No,no,no,I can'T.I can'T.

381
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,600
If I back down now,he'll see itas a sign of weakness. Look,

382
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,550
this is the way that guys do business.But--

383
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,110
so you called it.

384
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,510
He made mehis bitch.

385
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,030
Come on.

386
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,400
Here you go.Oh.

387
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:12,690
You know,ed,I've been thinking.

388
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,780
We've had a lot of fun and gamesaround here lately,

389
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:19,460
but maybe it's time to set a slightly moreprofessional tone in the office.

390
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:21,800
Oh,I get it.

391
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,750
Somebody went runningto mommy,didn't he? Huh?

392
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:24,660
What?

393
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,020
Tom loses a few bets,

394
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,740
so he tries to get his wifeto make me back off?

395
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:31,780
Oh,this is so alpha tau.

396
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,190
I am gonna make him pay.

397
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,730
No. No,you're notgonna make him pay.

398
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:39,860
You are gonnastop this now.

399
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,120
This is my company.

400
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:46,190
If people wanna work here,they play by my rules.

401
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,690
- Ed!
- What?

402
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,520
I'm calling you out.

403
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,100
Huh?Yes,you're right.

404
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,600
This is your company,so I'll play by your rules.

405
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:02,170
What do I have to do to get youto stop this frat boy crap?

406
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,620
Shave my eyebrows?Come to work naked?

407
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,520
Name your stakes.

408
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:06,470
I don't have time for this.

409
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,180
Aw,what's wrong,ed?

410
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,900
You afraid a phi kapp'sgonna get beaten by a girl?

411
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,840
Come on,big man...

412
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,670
it's just a little bet.

413
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:26,110
As you know,I thinkthat making the workplace fun is good for morale.

414
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:31,160
But lynette here thinksthat our shenanigans have gottena little out of hand.

415
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:33,740
oh,hold on. Hold on. 

416
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,070
I respect lynette's work ethic.

417
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:43,230
So we've decidedto settle the matter with a little testof intestinal fortitude.

418
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,560
If she can eat 

419
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,630
1 pound of our client's fine,farm-fresh pork product,

420
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,740
raw...

421
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,000
there'll be a moratoriumon wagering in the office.

422
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,320
oh,oh!

423
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,630
I knowyou are doing this for me.

424
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,650
You don't need to do this.

425
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,120
I don't need you fighting my fights.

426
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:04,990
I am not fighting your fights.

427
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,810
This is my fight

428
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:10,260
this is how guysdo business,right?

429
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,130
While we're young.

430
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:41,040
no shame in defeat,lynette.

431
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:43,650
No shame at all.

432
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,460
oh,she's gonna do it.

433
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,940
ohh!

434
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,140
oh,yes!

435
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,370
oh!

436
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,000
oh,this is too much.

437
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,690
oh!

438
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,220
what? 

439
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,390
She took the bet.

440
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:41,260
What? This is fun,people.

441
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,900
she's got one more.

442
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,060
so... 

443
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:10,930
can this be a placeof business again,ed?

444
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,280
- No more games?
- Sure.

445
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,880
You sucked all the funout of it anyway.

446
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:31,060
that was really something.

447
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,320
Thanks.

448
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:36,010
Could you scrounge me upa bucket?

449
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:48,900
Caleb saida nice,red-haired lady came to visit him.

450
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,250
Come on in,betty.

451
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,370
Get you a drink?

452
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,210
This is nota social call,bree!

453
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,940
Did you or did you not breakinto my home and talk to my son?

454
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:05,710
Caleb and I had,uh,a very lovely chat. Yes.

455
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,480
if you evercome near him again,

456
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,720
there will be hellto pay. Do you understand?

457
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:16,890
Aren't you gonna ask mewhat we talked about?

458
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,820
The name,um...

459
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,760
melanie foster came up.

460
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,460
I'm gonna pour youa drink now,betty,

461
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,100
because we're about to havea very honest discussion,

462
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:33,130
and I think you're gonnaneed a little help getting through it.

463
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,970
his name's zach young.

464
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,170
He lives with his father.

465
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,530
Mother committed suicideabout a year ago.

466
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,020
How did he end upwith these people?

467
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,550
How do you think?

468
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:49,750
Dierdre was strung out,noah.She gave him up.

469
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,630
I wanna see this boy.

470
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,820
Well,he's gota new family now. I can't just snap my fingersand get him in here.

471
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,670
Maybe not,but I can snap my fingers,

472
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,830
and detective sullivan can make it happen.

473
00:37:58,990 --> 00:37:59,970
- You don't wanna do that.
- No?

474
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:01,620
Is that reallythe way you wanna meet him--

475
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:06,120
have that thug drag him in hereso grandpa can give him a hug?

476
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:09,850
Fine. You bring him.I'll give you two days.

477
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:14,340
As you know,I'm on a bitof a clock here.

478
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,250
When caleb was born,

479
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:25,360
and the doctors discovered that he was different,

480
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:27,550
I didn't even cry.

481
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:35,200
It was the most painful moment of my life.

482
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:37,710
I didn't shed a single tear.

483
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:41,480
I just thought to myself,what's the point?

484
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,600
He is my son,

485
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,930
and I haveto raise him 

486
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,170
as best I can.

487
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,570
Now that's my job.

488
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,870
In a lot of ways,I feel so blessed.

489
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,720
Caleb is challenged,

490
00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:00,290
but he has such a sweet nature.

491
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:03,920
I'm sure you noticed thatwhen you came to visit.

492
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,690
Yes,I did.

493
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:11,380
I also noticed that you had himchained in the basement.

494
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:17,020
That's becauseof melanie foster.

495
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:24,070
Melanie was a girlthat matthew dated.

496
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,140
She was a debutante.

497
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,730
And liketypical teenagers,

498
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:31,730
their relationshipwas full of drama.

499
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:36,050
They were always breaking upand getting back together and breaking up.

500
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,380
One night,after oneof their big blow-ups,

501
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:45,190
caleb somehow convinced melanie to meet him downat our local lumberyard.

502
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:49,810
I can only imagine thatshe thought he was bringing some kind of apology from matthew

503
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,190
but he wasn'T.

504
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,700
Caleb told melanie

505
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,470
he was in love with her,

506
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:59,860
and thatif he was her boyfriend,

507
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,680
he would neverbreak up with her...

508
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:07,180
and she laughedin his face.

509
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,810
He tried to show herhe was serious by kissing her...

510
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:14,390
and she hit him.

511
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:21,070
He doesn't remember a lotof what happened after that,but he--

512
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:25,950
he does know thathe got very,very angry,and...

513
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:31,020
and that there was an axlying on the ground nearby him.

514
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,030
Yes,

515
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,490
my caleb killed melanie,

516
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,690
but I couldn'tlet him go to jail...

517
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,630
or worse,be put down,

518
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:50,290
for what was really my crime.

519
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:52,170
Your crime?

520
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:57,920
It was my responsibility.

521
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,880
I was supposedto protect him from himself.

522
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,680
I am his mother.

523
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:07,350
That was my job.

524
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:24,440
The world is filled with unlikely friendships.

525
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,650
How do they begin?

526
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:30,200
With one person desperately in need,

527
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:34,790
and another willing to lend a helping hand.

528
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,930
When such kindness is offered... 

529
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:40,130
We're finally able to see the worth of those we had previously written off.

530
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:44,410
And before we know it...

531
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,920
a bond has formed,

532
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:50,470
regardless of whether others can understand it.

533
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:59,650
Yes,unlikely friendships start up every day.

534
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:02,370
No one understands this 

535
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:06,810
more than the lonely.

536
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,210
In fact,

537
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,330
it's what they count on.
