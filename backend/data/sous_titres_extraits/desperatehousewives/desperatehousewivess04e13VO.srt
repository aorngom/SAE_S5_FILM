1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,770
Previously on DH...

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,520
Dylan and katherine raised their profile

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,980
and attracted the attention
of an unwanted admirer.

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,340
Mike made a surprising request...

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,890
do you think you can forgive me?

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,490
Which brought orson's
guilt to the surface.

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,630
I'm sorry, mike.

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,020
Oh, you're sleepwalking.

9
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,680
I'm sorry I ran you over, mike.

10
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,680
Gaby was learning to deal
with carlos being blind...

11
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,640
I'm sorry for what I'm
putting you through.

12
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,750
If it for anyone but you,
it wouldn't be worth it.

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,900
And lynette worried...

14
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,740
it's rick's place--
totally went up in flames.

15
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,710
That jealousy could drive
tom to an act of violence.

16
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,410
the thing you have to
know about lynette scavo

17
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,410
is that she had always
trusted her husband tom,

18
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,320
mostly because she could
always tell when he was lying.

19
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,680
Sometimes he would ask her
to repeat the question...

20
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,090
did I eat... your ice cream?
Is that what you're asking?

21
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,520
Or he would use odd words
he had never used before...

22
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,840
oh, I think it looks... spiffy.

23
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,000
Or his voice would get higher...

24
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:18,890
I guess she's pretty. I
mean... I didn't really notice.

25
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:25,580
clearly, tom scavo was at a distinct
disadvantage when lying to his wife.

26
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:30,980
And on this particular morning,
that's exactly what lynette...

27
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,050
<i>{\a6}ARSON SUSPECTED IN RESTAURANT FIRE</i>

28
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,190
was unting oN.

29
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,050
whatcha doing?

30
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,290
I amonesing for a cup of coffee, but
the stupid burner is acting up again.

31
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,830
Need a little caffeine fix?

32
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,510
Big-time.

33
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,750
Too much booze last
night. I'm really draggin'.

34
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,450
the open bar is no
longer your friend, huh?

35
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,510
Guess not.

36
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,920
But they were pouring top-shelf
stuff, and I couldn't resist.

37
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:02,630
Is that where you were during bree's
acceptance speech-- doing free shots at the bar?

38
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:07,060
No. Uh, I think that's when I snuck
out to the car to listen to the game.

39
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,760
You go alone?

40
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,290
WellI would've invited carlos, except...

41
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,140
obviously, he can't really
sneak around anymore, so...

42
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,860
yeah.

43
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:25,190
I was thinkin', if anyone
asks about that fire at rick's,

44
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,820
it'd be good if you had someone
to account for where you were.

45
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,290
Why would it matter?

46
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,280
I didn't start the fire.

47
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,100
Right, right. It's just...

48
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:41,520
if anyone thinks you did, it'd be handy
if y could prove them wrong, wouldn't it?

49
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,050
- you think I did it.
- No.

50
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,510
One stupid brick, and
now I'm an arsonist?

51
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,570
No, no. Of course not.

52
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,080
It's just, if the police came
here to ask us about the brick,

53
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,210
they're probably gonna ask us about
the fire, so you might wanna be ready.

54
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,860
Listen to me, lynette.As
mad as I have been at rick,

55
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:08,710
I had absolutely nothing to
do with this fire. We're fine.

56
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,450
- Okay.
- Good.

57
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:16,150
Lynette scavo had always
trusted her husband.

58
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,990
She had no idea that trust...

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,960
was about to go up in flames.

64
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,650
Everyone breaks the rules now and again,

65
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,230
and when they do, they
always haven excuse...

66
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,050
like the neighbor whose own
trash was already full...

67
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,910
or the blonde who forgot
to eat her breakfast...

68

or the employee who needed
an advance on his salary...

69
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:06,290
it's true-- everyone has a reason
for not following the rules...

even the people who are
meant to enforce them.

71
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,060
Cense and registration, please.

72
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,340
Well, what did I do? I wasn't speeding.

73
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,080
There's a construction zone back
there. You failed to slow down.

74
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:25,100
Are you sure? I didn't
see a sign or anything.

75
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,730
You wanna step out of the car, please?

76
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,580
You're not gonna give me a ticket,
are you? My mom will kill me.

77
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,020
Where do you go to school?

78
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,570
Fairview high.

79
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,950
- Pretty necklace.
- Oh, thanks.

80
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,290
Listen, I'm really sorry
about the construction zone.

81
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,170
I would have slowed down if
I had seen the sign, I swear.

82
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,620
I'll tell you what.

83
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,620
I'll let you go with a warning.

84
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,880
Just pay more attention next time, okay?

85
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,960
Thank you. That's very
nice of you. Thank you.

86
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,690
that's everything, I guess.

87
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,160
Well, if you forgot something, you
can just come back for it, or...

88
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,780
you could just not leave.

89
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,710
Oh, that's so sweet, but...

90
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:38,340
our house is livable again-- the downstairs
anyway-- and we have imposed long enough.

91
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,180
Besides, mike is comingome tonight, and
you're gonna need the house to yourselves.

92
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:48,430
Well, before you go, I
just want to say that, um...

93
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,850
having you here
these last few weeks--

94
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,770
susan, I'm just going across the street.

95
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,020
There's no need to act
like a silent movie heroine.

96
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,860
I know. I just... I can't stop now.

97
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,460
I broke the seal.

98
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:05,360
Well, um, as much as I appreciate
this naked display of emotion,

99
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,210
you know how this sort of
thing makes me uncomfortable.

100
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,530
I can't help it. My
hormones are in overdrive.

101
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,530
Didn't you get that way
when you were pregnant?

102
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,240
No. Never.

103
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,780
Ally?

104
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,130
Not even when you heard
an acoustic guitar?

105
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,840
No. Never.

106
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,560
Oh, I just can't
control myself like that.

107
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,540
Oh, sure, you can.

108
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,300
Whenever I feel my emotions
getting the best of me,

109
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:34,750
I simply picture an empty box, and I take
whatever I'm feeling and put that in the box,

110
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,700
and then i picture myself
putting the box away

111
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:42,180
in a big,empty closet
and closing the door.

112
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:46,500
Then if I have time, I
go back and open the box

113
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,010
and deal with the emotion...

114
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,220
in private, like a lady.

115
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,260
Thanks.

116
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,140
I'm gonna try that.

117
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,260
so you don't think I act like a lady?

118
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,290
prove me wrong, sweetie. Prove me wrong.

119
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,580
All right. Come on, girl.

120
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,990
Okay, carlos, here's the harness.

121
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,650
There you are!

122
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,580
Oh, you must be roxy!

123
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:28,250
Aren't you the cutest thing!

124
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,190
Okay, not too close. It's silk.

125
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,790
Gaby, this is steve. He's the
head trainer at the dog school.

126
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
Ah, nice to meet you.

127
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,980
Carlos told me how much he
enjoyed taking classes with roxy.

128
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,780
Well, they make a great team.

129
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:43,200
Well, I have got a million questions
about this little lifesaver here.

130
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,370
Okay, shoot.

131
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,330
Okay, hypothetical situation--
carlos and I are sitting on the couch.

132
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,010
I'm doing my nails. He's
whining for the remote.

133
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,290
How do I get roxy to fetch it for him?

134
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,080
she's serious.

135
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,780
Roxy doesn't do that.

136
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,080
Um, her job is to get carlos from point
"a" to point "b" as safely as possiblE.

137
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:10,720
I get that, but surely she's
trained to do other stuff, you know,

138
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,180
like find his keys or turn off
the radio or lick up his spills.

139
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,760
Yeah, and after that, she can go
solve crimes with shaggy and the gang.

140
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,860
Don't ve me your blind sarcasm.

141
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,740
I saw a collie on tv who
could push a lawn mower.

142
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,810
Do you have one of those?

143
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,910
Gaby, roxy's fantastic.

144
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:30,230
Really? Well, for a dog who's supposed
to help us, she sounds kind of limited.

145
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,910
sorry, but it's true.

146
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,210
She's not here to help us.

147
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,890
She's here to help me, which you would know if you
had bothered to show up to the spouses' orientation.

148
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,260
Well, I'm sorry.I was on
my hands and knees that day,

149
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:45,450
scouring the bathroom floor because
you fused to pee like a girl.

150
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,480
So... any other questions?

151
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,440
No, it's crystal clear.

152
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,630
Carlos gets a new best friend, and
I get to check the sofa for ticks.

153
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,950
Yay for gaby!

154
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,320
Did I exaggerate?

155
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,070
Actually, you were kind

156
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,820
oh, it feels good to take a shower
in my own house. At you doing?

157
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:15,110
In honor of you coming home, we are making
your favorite meal-- steak and mashed potatoes.

158
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,720
Oh, that sounds great.

159
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,690
For future reference, my
favorite is potatoes au gratin.

160
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,700
Since when?

161
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,730
Since always. Since I was 3.

162
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,270
You could say "au
gratin" when you were 3?

163
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,820
Oh, it's fine. Susan,
mashed is great, too.

164
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,820
it's not your favorite?

165
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,670
what are you doing?

166
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,310
Excuse me. I have to put something
in a box and stick it in the closet.

167
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,040
Hormones.

168
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,670
Got it.

169
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,660
Pretty much anything
sets her off these days.

170
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,450
Uh, which is why I haven't told her...

171
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,950
told her what? Something wrong?

172
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,060
Well, when bree and orson
were staying with us,

173
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,260
this weird thing happened.

174
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,030
Oh, yeah. Naked orson? I heard.

175
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,540
Must have been quite a show.

176
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,180
No, this was the next night.

177
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:22,040
He was sleepwalking, and he
said something kinda strange.

178
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,370
But like I said, he was asleep,
so it's probably nothing.

179
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,440
Julie, what'd he say?

180
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:34,590
He said... "I'm sorry I ran over mike."

181
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,420
- what?
- It's crazy, right?

182
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,450
Why would he say something like that?

183
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,560
He didn't even know
you when that happened.

184
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,320
Yeah, you're right. It's crazy.

185
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:47,400
Yeah, that's what I figured.

186
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,970
Okay, well, I'm gonna go check
on mom and make sure she's okay.

187
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,390
We don't need any more
drama in this house.

188
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,920
yeah, I agree.

189
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,710
How's the move going?

190
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,170
Need an extra pair of hands?

191
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,210
No, thanks. We're almost done.

192
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,230
Okay, well, I won't
get in your way then.

193
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:18,470
Let me just run something by you.

194
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,890
I got a call today from a couple who
loved our work on the founder's ball.

195
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,150
Oh, how sweet.

196
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:29,250
Yes, and they want to hire us
to do their anniversary party.

197
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,060
Hire us? But we're not a business.

198
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,440
We could be. Think about it.

199
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,950
We do the exact same
thing we did at the ball,

200
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,420
only this time, we walk
away with a big, fat check.

201
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:44,060
Katherine, need I remind you we nearly
came to blows over floral choices?

202
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,710
I think it's our creative friction
that makes us a great team.

203
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,110
I think it's our creative friction
that nearly caused me to poison you.

204
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,030
All right, look, bree, I'm
gonna be honest with you.

205
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,830
With adam out of the house,
I really need the money.

206
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,050
I sympathize.I do,
but I have a new baby,

207
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:03,120
and it's really more work than
I care to take on right now.

208
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,970
I understand.

209
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:09,590
- Guess I'll just do it myself then.
- Excuse me?

210
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,460
Now did you take pictures of
those table settings you designed?

211
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:16,280
I'd love to get copies.
The couple raved about them.

212
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,840
Yeah, sure.

213
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:24,440
You know, I don't really think it's fair that
you should profit from something that I designed.

214
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,110
You're right.It would only be fair

215
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,180
if I asked you to do this with me, which
I did, and you said no. So on we go.

216
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:35,030
I hope you don't mind if I serve
your cinnamon apple crumble.

217
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,210
That is a cherished
recipe from my grandmother.

218
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:42,570
Well, w it's a cherished recipe
from catering by katherine.

219
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,790
Oh, I see what's going on here.

220
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,260
This is shameless emotional blackmail.

221
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,790
And?

222
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:54,610
And... it worked beautifully. I'm in.

223
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,660
No more doggy treats. She's had enough.

224
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,240
But she's been so good.

225
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,500
Yeah? Well, when she learns how to
make granite sparkle, she can have more.

226
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,280
I'm giving her a treat.

227
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,710
Carlos, I said no.

228
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,400
fine. One treat.

229
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,350
That's it.Those things are expensive,

230
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,130
and until your disability kicks
in, we have to tighten our belts.

231
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,910
So I guess that means you won't
be getting your hair done anymore.

232
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,260
Carlos, remember what
my fingers look like?

233
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,760
Just picture the middle
one all by itself.

234
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,080
Besides, you're the one
who married me for my looks.

235
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:46,440
Well, I'm blind now, so as long
as you use deodorant, I'm good.

236
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,750
Do you have any idea how
selfish you sound right now?

237
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,130
Just because you're blind,
the world should suffer?

238
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,810
I'm just saying, you know,
$300 visits to mr. Francois--

239
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,140
carlos, I'm getting my hair
done! End of discussion!

240
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:01,490
what are you barking at?
You got your damn treat.

241
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,650
You know, if we really want to save money,
you could cut down on those cuban cigars.

242
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,880
Or... here's a thought.

243
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,280
You could get a job.

244
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,060
- Why don't you get a job?
- Doing what?

245
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,610
Put flags on pencils and
sell them at the airport.

246
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,780
What do I care? Just
get out of my kitchen.

247
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,230
- What is this about?
- I don't know.

248
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,600
I guess she doesn't like
it when you smack me.

249
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,780
Oh, so now I can't hit my
own husband in my own house?

250
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:30,800
Look, we can cut corners all you want, but
I am not gonna skimp when it comes to my dog.

251
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,080
Roxy, come.

252
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:47,080
- hey, neighbor.
- Oh, mike.

253
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,870
Welcome back. You're looking well.

254
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,280
Yeah, well, you know me. Indestructible.

255
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,040
- What you looking for?
- A hammer.

256
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:01,060
We're putting some of
the pictures back up.

257
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,590
This it?

258
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,970
Thanks, buddy.

259
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,110
You got a minute?

260
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:15,320
Uh, actually, uh, bree's
waiting-- waiting for me.

261
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,630
You said something to julie
when you were sleepwalking.

262
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,940
I did?

263
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:25,660
Yeah, and I need you to clear it up.

264
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,180
Are you the guy that ran me over?

265
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,870
mike...

266
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,280
I'm so sorry.

267
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,530
I'm so...

268
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,600
no way.

269
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,220
That mutt is not sleeping in our bed!

270
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,350
She's clean. It's okay.

271
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,840
No. No, it's not.

272
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,420
I read the pamphlet steve left.

273
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,490
These dogs are not allowed on furniture.

274
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,240
I know. I...

275
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,590
I just think it's good for a dog to
sleep with its master. It helps us bond.

276
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,950
Well, if you ever want to bond with
my boobs again, you'll get her off!

277
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,210
you're being selfish.

278
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,690
We can put her at the foot of the bed.

279
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,950
Carlos, no!

280
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:31,500
she doesn't like it when
you yell at me, remember?

281
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,110
you're right, baby. I'm sorry.

282
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,910
let me try it this way.

283
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,940
you listen to me, you
blind son of a bitch.

284
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:48,950
If you don't get this mangy, 6-nippled,
cujo wannabe off my satin sheets,

285
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,020
you n't just need a dog to get around.

286
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,200
You'll need a motorized wheelchair
that you steer with your tongue.

287
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,060
Really?

288
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:02,200
Carlos, I mean it.

289
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:06,200
Who's it gonna
be-- me or the dog?

290
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:28,980
maternity
lingerie-- ah, right.

291
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,860
Why don't they just call
it what it really is?

292
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,910
A pup tent to hide your stretch marks.

293
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:40,740
Oh, actually, if it's okay, I'm really
not in the mood right now. I'm sorry.

294
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,480
- I understand.
- Thanks.

295
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,670
You just don't want to be crushed
under the weight of a repulsive cow.

296
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,800
- That is not it.
- No, I get it.

297
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:53,340
really, I knew this day was coming.

298
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:57,770
I just didn't know it would
be a day when I was so horny.

299
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:02,530
honey, I still find you incredibly sexy.

300
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,880
It's me. I...

301
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,810
I just got a lot on my mind right now.

302
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,530
What's going on?

303
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,980
I found out something today.

304
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,050
I didn't want to tell you, but...

305
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,250
well, you can tell me anything.

306
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:25,240
That's what we talked about in
all those sessions with the doctor.

307
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,300
you're right.

308
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,220
But if I tell you, you have to promise
to let me handle this my own way.

309
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,870
who could that be at this hour?

310
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,750
susan.

311
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,450
what on earth?

312
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,570
You are never to come
near my family ever again!

313
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,610
- Do you understand?
- What are you talking about?

314
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,190
Do you hear me, orson?

315
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,710
Damn it. Susan, I-- I told
you to let me handle this.

316
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,540
Will someone please
tell me wh's going on?

317
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:07,140
So you don't know that your
husband tried to kill mike?

318
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,470
What?

319
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,500
Look, I explained this to
mike. I panicked.I was trying--

320
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:18,250
trying to protect your
mother? I know. Who cares?

321
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:23,480
Youdrove the car, you ran him
over, and you left him for dead!

322
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,960
Susan, let's go.

323
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,430
And the worst part...

324
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,810
all this time, you
pretended to be our friend.

325
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:55,360
If there was one thing gabrielle
solis would not tolerate,

326
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,550
it was a rival,

327
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,880
whether she walked onwo legs... or four.

328
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:09,230
So when gabrielle crept into her bedroom
that morning, she'd made up her mind...

329
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:14,150
the bitch had to go.

330
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,860
roxy... look what I've got.

331
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,590
come on. Come on.

332
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:27,410
Okay,yes

333
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,290
Okay, let's go.

334
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,450
let's go, roxy. Let's
go, roxy. Let's go.

335
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,470
let's go in the car.

336
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,260
hey there, dylan.

337
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:49,830
Don't you remember me? I'm the cop
who didn't give you a ticket yesterday.

338
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,220
Um, yeah, I remember.

339
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,140
would it be okay if I sat down?

340
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,880
I just want to have a
little chat with you.

341
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,490
Why?

342
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,930
Don't worry. You're not in trouble.

343
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,390
Actually, I can't stay.

344
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,250
I'm meeting my friend
julie at the mall, so I--

345
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,470
look, I'm--i'm not trying
to scare you. I just...

346
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,390
I just want to talk.

347
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,700
Talk about what?

348
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,340
How's your mom doing?

349
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,840
You know my mom?

350
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,830
Oh, yeah.

351
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,220
Look, a couple of days ago, I saw a
picture of you and kathy in the paper,

352
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:40,330
and I did a background check, and I found out
that you're living back at your aunt's place.

353
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,380
When you left yesterday, I
was parked down the street.

354
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,270
You followed me?

355
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,830
- So when you pulled me over,
that was-- - I lied to you.

356
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,820
You weren't speeding. I'm sorry.

357
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,290
I just had to meet you.

358
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,240
Who are you?

359
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,670
I'm wayne davis.

360
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,260
I'm your father.

361
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,720
Oh,roxy,this way.

362
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,560
Uh,mrs. Solis,what are you doing here?

363
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,770
Uh,I'm bringing roxy back.

364
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,450
Uh,what?

365
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,100
Shame,isn't it?

366
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:37,010
I mean,i personally adored the little
angel,but she and carlos just did not get along.

367
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:37,780
Really?

368
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,500
Well,sorry it didn't work out.

369
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,460
I gotta run.

370
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,260
uh,tell carlos I'll call
him about another dog.

371
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:47,380
Oh,well,actually,we found one.

372
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,350
From where?

373
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,700
We're the only guide
dog school in the area.

374
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,240
Well,that's it.

375
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,980
It's not a dog.

376
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:57,840
We got him a seeing...eye...monkey.

377
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,170
He's amazing.

378
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:03,240
not only can he call
9-1-1,he can toast a bagel.

379
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,180
Bye.

380
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:12,320
roxy,what the heck happened back there?

381
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,690
Roxy!

382
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,660
Roxy!

383
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,410
Roxy,stop!

384
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,140
gaby,where were you? Where's roxy?

385
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,490
Oh,carlos,I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

386
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,470
What? At happened?

387
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:33,050
Well,you know how you like it
when I read you the box scores?

388
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:37,280
When I went out to get the paper--
ly thinking of making you happy--

389
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,030
gaby,where's my dog?

390
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,810
She ran away.

391
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,340
When I opened the door,she saw
a squirrel,and she took off.

392
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,250
She's gone? Well,you gotta go find her.

393
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,440
Where do you think I've been?

394
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,070
There's no sign of her anywhere.

395
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,320
Yeah,I'm sure you looked
really,really hard.

396
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,450
How dare you.

397
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,540
I have looked from one
end of town to the other,

398
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:56,480
and I'm telling you,
she's nowhere to be found.

399
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,320
but since you love her so
much,I'm gonna keep looking.

400
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,530
was that roxy?

401
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,590
I'm not sure.

402
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,450
Why don't I go look?

403
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,120
No. It's the scavo dog...

404
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,980
way down in their yard.

405
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:20,780
I guess it's true-- lose one
sense,all the others get heightened.

406
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,530
okay,you get that.

407
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,780
I'm gonna go find your dog.

408
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,270
come on,you stupid mutt.

409
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,530
gaby,you still here?

410
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,610
Yeah,still no sign of roxy.

411
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,670
But don't worry.

412
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:37,950
I'm on the case.

413
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:43,720
That was steve from the guide dog place.

414
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,950
You want a piece of pie or somethin'?

415
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,870
Yeah,I'm not ngry either.

416
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,800
I don't know what to say to you.

417
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,160
You don't have to say anything.

418
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,590
I'm having a good time
just looking at you.

419
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,770
You have my nose.

420
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,150
bet you didn't know that,right?

421
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,900
My mom says we left because
you used to beat her.

422
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,020
Is that true?

423
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:29,790
Yeah,I hit her a couple times.

424
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,790
So you admit it?

425
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,590
What,did you think I was gonna lie and
tell you that I was a great husband?

426
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:36,580
'Cause I wasn'T.

427
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:40,050
But you gotta know,there's
two sides to every story,

428
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:45,260
and I swear to god,your
mom gave as good as she got.

429
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,870
I mean,you believe me,right?

430
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,920
I don't know.

431
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,770
You know what? This was a mistake.

432
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,740
I should go.

433
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,350
Go? We just got here.

434
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:01,390
Look,I didn't track you
down to cause any problem

435
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,380
I only wanted to make sure that
your mom raised you properly,

436
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,580
and now I see that she did.

437
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,180
I mean,you're...

438
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,780
you're spectacular.

439
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:18,350
That's what I needed...to
know that you're okay and...

440
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,860
that a little part of
you looks just like me.

441
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:27,730
How can you just walk away?

442
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,030
'Cause I'm not the
same jerk I used to be.

443
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,140
Sure,I'd like to have
a relationship with you,

444
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:37,680
but if your mom is still scared
of me after all these years,uh...

445
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,040
no.

446
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:44,010
I don't want to upset her again.

447
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,310
I don't haveo tell her.

448
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,760
What?

449
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,640
She doesn't have to know that I saw you.

450
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,390
Oh,that'S...

451
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,430
I don't know about that.

452
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,060
It's just that I have
so many questions,and...

453
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:13,460
I don't think we'd be hurting anybody
if we just sat and talked for a while.

454
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:17,910
And we'd keep this from your mom?

455
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,310
Sure.

456
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,680
Well...okay.

457
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:37,270
darlin',bring me back that dessert menu.

458
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,290
I wanna have a slice
of pie with my daughter.

459
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:49,610
uh,I think we might be out of candles.

460
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,180
I don't think so. Check under the bar.

461
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,470
Rick.

462
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,580
How's it goin'?

463
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,720
"How's it goin'"?

464
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,190
It's goin' pretty bad.

465
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,390
I didn't mean to.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry--

466
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,620
sorry for your troubles.

467
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,760
Oh,that's touching,man.

468
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:14,460
Thanks.

469
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,960
So did you just come here to bust my hump,or
is there something I can help you with?

470
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,370
Actually,you can help me.

471
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:28,620
You can help me figure out what the hell these were
doing by the back door of my torched restaurant.

472
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,300
How should I know?

473
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:45,060
so that's how you're gonna play this?

474
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,980
Uh,no candles here.

475
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,320
I'm--I'm gonna go
check in the back.

476
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,590
Great.

477
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:57,660
Look,I can see you're upset,pal,but
I'm not the guy you're looking for.

478
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,500
you know I respect you...

479
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,270
hey,andrew. What do you need?

480
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:06,820
Uh,I'm looking for candles,and--and
that guy rick's here.

481
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,050
oh,my god!

482
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:11,760
Stop it!

483
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,160
What are you doing? Stop.

484
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,360
Hey,easy. EasY.

485
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,730
Just stop it!

486
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,880
Are you okay?

487
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:19,900
Yeah.

488
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,880
Andrew,do something!

489
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,100
Do something!

490
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,240
stop it!

491
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,200
Stop!

492
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:38,170
Oh,for god sakes,what
is the matter with you?

493
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,750
What are you,12 years old?

494
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,440
Stop it.

495
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:44,430
Jeez.

496
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:04,840
so when are you guys gonna
finish grilling my husband?

497
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,000
It won't be much longer,ma'am.

498
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:24,770
you know,in spite of everything that's
happened,it's really good to see you again.

499
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:31,740
It makes me realize how much I miss you.

500
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,220
If you insist on questioning my
husband about a crime he didn't commit,

501
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,670
you should at least have all the facts.

502
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,230
Okay.

503
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,280
You've got my attention.

504
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:50,800
Well,for starters,mr. Coletti opened
his restaurant to get back at me

505
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,210
because I wouldn't
have an affair with him.

506
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:52,870
Honey.

507
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,940
Oh,so you're saying your husband
had two motives for setting the fire?

508
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,840
No.

509
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:02,010
I am saying that if anyone
had an ax to grind,it's rk.

510
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,440
Maybe he set the fire himself
soe could blame my husband.

511
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:06,660
I was at the gym.

512
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,130
You can call my trainer.

513
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,450
And tom was at the
founder's ball with me.

514
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,790
We have witnesses that say
he disappeared for a while.

515
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:18,840
I told you,I was in the car
listening to the basketball game.

516
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:19,860
That's true.

517
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,540
I saw him.

518
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:28,210
I was mad that he ditched me,so I
went to drag his ass back inside.

519
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,220
But when I saw him shoutingt the radio,

520
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:33,820
I decided I'll just wait and make
his life miserable when we get home.

521
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:38,200
So unless there's a law againschoosing
lebron james over your wife,

522
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:40,460
I think we're done here.

523
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,440
All right.

524
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:47,990
So that's it?

525
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,070
Y-you're just gonna let him go?

526
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,330
Look,we don't have enough
evidence to hold him,sir.

527
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,720
Because his wife provided him an alibi?

528
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,710
Come on,man.

529
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,870
Rick,look.

530
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,640
You know me.

531
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:07,420
If tom had done something like this,do
you really think I would protect him?

532
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,350
Fine.

533
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:32,060
you know,you didn't have to
make up that story for me.

534
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,710
Didn't i?

535
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:35,140
'Cause it kinda seemed like they
had you against the ropes in there.

536
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:40,170
Well,that would only be a problem if I
were guilty,and clearly,I'm not,right?

537
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,550
- God,you don't believe me,do you?
- Sure,I do.

538
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:47,740
It must've been some other random maniac with a
grudge against rick who burned down his restaurant.

539
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,890
So you're calling me a liar?

540
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:50,310
That's what you're doing.
You're saying I lied.

541
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,260
Well,it wouldn't be the first time.

542
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,690
You lied about the brick,and
you were pretty smooth,too.

543
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,730
Hell,i bought it.

544
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:58,530
Yeah,just like I bought your story
about never sleeping with rick.

545
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,280
Excuse me?

546
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:01,470
- "Oh,look at me,rick. You know me,rick."
- Okay.

547
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,840
God,I felt like telling
you guys to get a room.

548
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:06,020
Okay,you are angry,so I'm
gonna let that one pass,

549
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:10,770
and I'm gonna say this
for e very last time.

550
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:15,040
nothing happened between me and rick.

551
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,890
Okay.

552
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:22,100
I didn't set that fire.

553
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,890
You see? I can talk slow,too.

554
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,610
Carlos asked me to pick up
some doggy treats for roxy.

555
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:40,780
He called you?

556
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,140
Why didn't he ask me?

557
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:46,410
Oh,I think you were busy at the
time...kidnapping his guide dog.

558
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,480
classy,by the way.

559
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,540
Don't judge me.

560
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,220
You don't know this hound from hell.

561
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,810
I raise my voice a
teensy bit,and she barks,

562
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,500
or I give carlos a little
smack,and she growls.

563
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,610
Well,I have an idea.

564
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,560
Why don't you not do those things?

565
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,340
Thanks for the biscuits,edie.

566
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,480
No,I'm serious.

567
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:10,600
There was always a certain...sick charm
to the way you used to abuse carlos.

568
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:13,450
But now that he's blind,it's just sick.

569
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,290
We're fine.

570
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:14,980
This is who we are.

571
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,220
This is our relationship.

572
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:22,480
Well,ur relationship has to
change,gaby,because he's changed.

573
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:24,540
Not that much. Just his eyes.

574
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,660
Mm,no.

575
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,370
I know carlos. He's proud.

576
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,670
He's gonna pretend that he can
still go toe-to-toe with you

577
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,580
as if he was the same
man that he always was.

578
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,940
But he's not,and he
will never admit that.

579
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:44,630
are you done with your armchair
analysis,3-divorce annie?

580
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,000
Sure.

581
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,380
But if you're not gonna
treat carlos right,

582
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,400
there are plenty of other
womenout there who will.

583
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:53,670
I think I proved that.

584
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,180
why don't you come inside?

585
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,760
I can't come out my front door
every day and see that man.

586
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:14,580
We have to move.

587
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,990
susan...

588
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,960
I know this is difficult,

589
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:27,920
but before you start putting up "for
sale" signs,let's just take a step back.

590
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,020
Take a step back from what?

591
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,370
He tried to murder you.

592
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,500
I know what orson did
was horrible,but...

593
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,580
I've decided to forgive him.

594
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,350
How can you do that?

595
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,820
He put you in a coma.

596
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:42,600
I sat there day after day,wondering
if you were gonna live.

597
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:45,600
As far as I'm concerned,orson
can go to hell.

598
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,470
Well,I've talked to him.

599
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,420
Trust me,he's already been there.

600
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:52,900
Well,that's not enough.

601
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,950
He should pay for what he did.

602
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,670
He should go to prison.

603
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,890
And what,leave bree without a
husband and benjamin without a dad?

604
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,100
You don't want tha look...

605
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,960
I've done some pretty
horrible things in my life,

606
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:13,790
but you forgave me because you
knew how much I regretted 'em.

607
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:17,350
I really believe he's
sorry for what he did.

608
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:20,510
So now i have to forgive hi

609
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:25,080
I've just got to.

610
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,200
But...

611
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,350
I also understand if you can'T.

612
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:52,400
Hey,you guys know you're not
supposed to be out of bed.

613
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:55,610
How come daddy's sleeping
on the couch again?

614
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,700
Come here.

615
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,590
Come on.

616
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:03,720
okay.

617
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,940
Mommy and daddy are sort of...fighting,

618
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:09,640
but we're working through it.

619
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:12,110
What are you fighting about?

620
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:17,330
Oh,something he did that
made mommy really mad.

621
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,440
Can we talk to you about something?

622
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:25,050
Yes,of course.

623
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,510
The other day at the pizza place...

624
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,820
We heard daddy say that man
wanted to take you away from us.

625
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:35,790
Oh,sweetie,I am so sorry.

626
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,180
I bet that really scared you,didn't it?

627
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,730
Yeah.

628
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:46,060
So when you went to that party,we got on
our bikes and de down to his restaurant.

629
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,040
You did what?

630
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:51,170
We just wanted him to go away.

631
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,080
That's why we set the fire.

632
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:59,180
So please don't be mad at daddy.

633
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,840
Oh,my god.

634
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,900
mike says I need to forgive orson...

635
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:22,270
- susan--
- and he's right.

636
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,920
I have to find a way to
make peace with all of this.

637
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,670
But you need to understand,it's gonna b
one of the hardest things I've ever done.

638
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:40,210
And like most things in my life,I probably
won't do it with much elegance or grace.

639
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:46,020
So if I don't come over
to your house for coffee...

640
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,500
if I don't smile when
the two of you walk by,

641
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:54,570
just please know that I still love you.

642
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:58,250
And for forgiving orson...

643
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,660
just be patient.

644
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:05,220
I'll get there.

645
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:20,880
I think it's admirable that
you wanna forgive orson...

646
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:25,860
because I can'T.

647
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,050
whatcha doin'?

648
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:48,080
Working on the menu for the event
that bree and I are catering.

649
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:52,070
I have to stop now to...pick up the
invitations at the printer's beforehey closE.

650
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,240
I can do that for you.

651
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,240
It's okay,sweetie.

652
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,380
No,I want to.

653
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:59,050
Maybe I could pick up some
dinner for us on the way back.

654
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:04,800
You know,mrs. Hoskins' daughter
became nice like this once...

655
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:08,090
right before she brought
home a boy named slash.

656
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,980
I'm being nice because I've
been a pain lately,and...

657
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:16,010
with adam gone,we need to be a team.

658
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,980
It's just us now.

659
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:26,260
what?

660
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:29,310
It's just...

661
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:38,460
it's like you turned into this lovely
young woman when I wasn't looking.

662
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,080
We have to stop at the
printer on the way to dinner.

663
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:55,370
Whatever you say,sweetheart.

664
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:16,200
The truth is,everyone breaks
the rules now and then...

665
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,430
well,what you've you been doing?

666
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,400
Never thinking for one
second they might get caught.

667
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,280
Some things disappear.

668
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:27,050
like,that happened to me like...

669
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:34,610
but if they do,they
simply ask for forgiveness.

670
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:43,740
And most of the time,they receive it.

671
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:56,370
But some acts are so wicked,they
demand only our condemnation.

672
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,290
How do people avoid such a fate?

673
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:07,710
Well...the trick is knowing which
rules are made to be broken...

674
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,810
and which rules...

675
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:12,510
are not.
