on Desperate Housewives...</i>

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,256
{\a3}<i>In the wake of a tragedy,</i>

3
00:00:05,868 --> 00:00:07,549
{\a3}<i>a daughter was safe...</i>

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,707
{\a3}You saved her life.
We owe you everything.

5
00:00:09,874 --> 00:00:11,279
{\a3}<i>Orson was changed...</i>

6
00:00:11,446 --> 00:00:13,722
{\a3}There's a good chance
your husband's paralyzed.

7
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,753
<i>An unborn twin was gone...</i>

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,183
We lost the baby...

9
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:20,140
but the other baby is fine.

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,981
- <i>And an ex-husband...</i>
- Karl didn't make it.

11
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:25,020
- Oh, my God.
- <i>Was dead.</i>

12
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:35,361
<i>A month after the
death of Karl Mayer,</i>

13
00:00:35,531 --> 00:00:38,701
<i>his family assembled
for the reading of his will.</i>

14
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:43,286
<i>To each, Karl left something
to remember him by.</i>

15
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,445
<i>To his great aunt,
he left a grand piano.</i>

16
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:51,976
<i>To his favorite cousin,
he left gold cuff links.</i>

17
00:00:52,747 --> 00:00:56,709
<i>To his beloved daughter,
he left cash and securities.</i>

18
00:00:57,512 --> 00:01:01,324
<i>But Karl Mayer left his most
extraordinary possession of all</i>

19
00:01:02,105 --> 00:01:05,753
<i>to someone who wasn't
expecting a thing.</i>

20
00:01:05,923 --> 00:01:08,652
"And finally,
to my ex-wife, Susan Mayer..."

21
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:10,612
That's me.

22
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,513
I was just here
to support my daughter.

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,994
Seriously, I've been playing
hangman on my phone.

24
00:01:20,602 --> 00:01:23,614
- You were saying?
- "To my dearest Susie Q.,

25
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:26,832
"who endured my infidelities
far longer than she should have,

26
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:30,927
"years of cheating, betrayals
almost from the day we were married..."

27
00:01:31,094 --> 00:01:33,663
Can we skip to the part
where I get stuff?

28
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:37,468
Don't look at me like that.
You got the piano.

29
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,773
"While I was never good
at hiding my affairs of the flesh,"

30
00:01:40,943 --> 00:01:43,250
"I'm ashamed to say
that I was more successful

31
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,434
at concealing some
of my financial affairs."

32
00:01:45,782 --> 00:01:47,227
What does that mean?

33
00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:49,938
I think dad hid money from you
when you were married.

34
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:53,424
It's not money, exactly.

35
00:01:53,594 --> 00:01:56,612
It seems your ex-husband was
part owner in a business.

36
00:01:58,123 --> 00:02:01,954
He was having affairs, ran a law firm
and he owned a secret business?

37
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:05,919
Glad you're finally getting
a little rest.

38
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:09,715
He specifically asks
that you keep an open mind.

39
00:02:10,324 --> 00:02:11,794
It's very successful.

40
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:16,639
If it's so successful,
why do I need to keep an open mind?

41
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,133
<i>Yes,</i>

42
00:02:18,393 --> 00:02:22,346
<i>Karl Mayer left his ex-wife
something to remember him by...</i>

43
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:30,982
<i>Not that there was any
chance she wod forget him.</i>

00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:51,619
<i>All kinds of men go to
The Double D gentlemen's club.</i>

47
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,556
<i>Frat boys looking for a thrill...</i>

48
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:58,543
<i>Soldiers looking to get lucky...</i>

49
00:02:59,202 --> 00:03:02,216
<i>CEOs looking to close a deal.</i>

50
00:03:03,105 --> 00:03:07,058
{\pos(192,210)}<i>Yes,
all kinds of men go to Double D's,</i>

51
00:03:07,653 --> 00:03:11,381
{\pos(192,230)}<i>which can be very
upsetting to all kinds of women.</i>

52
00:03:14,911 --> 00:03:17,061
{\pos(192,230)}Jimbo Rooney,
co-owner of Double D's.

53
00:03:18,393 --> 00:03:20,982
{\pos(192,230)}I was real sad
to hear about Karl's passing.

54
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,823
{\pos(192,230)}He was a good man,

55
00:03:22,993 --> 00:03:25,612
{\pos(192,230)}and he cared about each
and every one of these dancers.

56
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,118
{\pos(192,230)}I'm sure.
Karl was always a big supporter

57
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:30,810
of the arts.

58
00:03:31,627 --> 00:03:33,495
So... Who do I speak to about

59
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,456
selling my share
of herpes on parade?

60
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:40,301
{\pos(192,230)}Are you sure you want to do that?
Business has been real good lately,

61
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:43,463
{\pos(192,230)}especially since we started
topless karaoke tuesdays.

62
00:03:44,173 --> 00:03:46,700
{\pos(192,230)}As lucrative an enterprise
as that seems...

63
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,199
{\pos(192,200)}Take a look around.
Have a drink.

64
00:03:49,369 --> 00:03:51,406
{\pos(192,200)}And then if you want to sell,

65
00:03:51,576 --> 00:03:53,890
{\pos(192,210)}you have your lawyer call me.

66
00:03:54,786 --> 00:03:56,138
{\pos(192,210)}Look at that.

67
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,268
{\pos(192,210)}You made the o's in "Rooney"
into boobs.

68
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:02,408
{\pos(192,230)}- Lovely.
- You like that?

69
00:04:02,578 --> 00:04:05,199
{\pos(192,230)}Wait till you see
my partner Vic's business card.

70
00:04:05,369 --> 00:04:07,740
He took the "v,"
and he made it into a...

71
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,910
{\pos(192,230)}Got it.

72
00:04:09,077 --> 00:04:10,949
{\pos(192,230)}I think
I'd really like that drink now.

73
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,037
Thanks, but I'm
not here for the show.

74
00:04:23,207 --> 00:04:25,755
I just found out
that I own half this place.

75
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:28,562
{\pos(192,210)}No kiddin'.
Nice to meet you.

76
00:04:28,732 --> 00:04:31,469
{\pos(192,210)}I'm Jennifer Morelli,
but at 10:00, I'm "Destiny."

77
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,032
{\pos(192,210)}I'm Susan Delfino.

78
00:04:34,202 --> 00:04:36,432
{\pos(192,210)}At 10:00, I am in
a flannel nightgown.

79
00:04:36,781 --> 00:04:38,852
We have a Delfino
that comes in here.

80
00:04:39,705 --> 00:04:40,705
{\pos(192,230)}Really?

81
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:44,023
{\pos(192,230)}- It's a pretty common name.
- I think he's a plumber.

82
00:04:44,442 --> 00:04:45,446
Really?

83
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:49,041
{\pos(192,230)}Maybe there's another
plumber with that last name.

84
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:51,286
{\pos(192,230)}Mike, that's it.
Mike Delfino.

85
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:53,992
{\pos(192,230)}Tall guy, brown hair, nice smile?

86
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,535
Big busted nose?

87
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,036
I don't think so.

88
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,891
Wait till the next time you see him.

89
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:06,900
A TV? You guys
didn't have to do that.

90
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,383
{\pos(192,230)}- Yes, we absolutely did.
- We have a family rule,

91
00:05:09,553 --> 00:05:13,355
{\pos(192,230)}save our daughter from being squashed
by a plane, you get a 60-inch plasma.

92
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:16,382
{\pos(192,230)}And a faux leather remote caddy.

93
00:05:16,552 --> 00:05:19,045
{\pos(192,230)}Thanks.
This is very generous.

94
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:21,352
Please. We could never make up
for what you did.

95
00:05:21,753 --> 00:05:24,761
{\pos(192,210)}Or for how I behaved toward you
the past couple of weeks.

96
00:05:24,931 --> 00:05:27,358
{\pos(192,210)}- I was such a bitch.
- We both said things.

97
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,694
But I said a lot worse a lot louder.

98
00:05:30,235 --> 00:05:31,446
Yeah, you did.

99
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:35,916
{\pos(192,210)}By the way, I talked to HR, and
they are fine with continuing to pay you

100
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,453
{\pos(192,210)}until the baby is born
and for six weeks after that.

101
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:43,541
{\pos(192,210)}That's amazing.
Will Terrence fill in until I get back?

102
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,627
Actually, no.
He took the job in Miami.

103
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,462
So who's gonna take up the slack?

104
00:05:48,801 --> 00:05:51,590
{\pos(192,210)}I'll put in extra hours,
work weekends.

105
00:05:51,757 --> 00:05:53,760
{\pos(192,210)}Don't worry about it.
You focus on that baby.

106
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,621
{\pos(192,210)}Really? I don't want to have
this fall on you.

107
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,201
{\pos(192,210)}We gotta get going.
We've got Juanita's interview.

108
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,630
{\pos(192,210)}Right. Lynette,
do not worry. I got your back.

109
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,750
{\pos(192,210)}But I feel so guilty taking
your money and leaving you in the lurch.

110
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,854
I got a crazy idea.
What if I fill in for Lynette?

111
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,775
- They're in a hurry. No time for jokes.
- I'm serious.

112
00:06:13,945 --> 00:06:16,937
I've done her job, or pretty damn
similar, when I was in advertising.

113
00:06:17,107 --> 00:06:19,619
I could step in for her
until she gets back on her feet.

114
00:06:19,874 --> 00:06:22,205
But that's putting Carlos
in an awkward position.

115
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,960
- I think it's a great idea.
- Me, too.

116
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,200
{\pos(192,210)}I think
it's a great idea, in theory,

117
00:06:29,883 --> 00:06:32,689
{\pos(192,220)}But it's such a complicated job.

118
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:35,802
You don't think I can handle it?

119
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,515
{\pos(192,220)}I think you'd be wonderful.

120
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,768
Great, it's settled then.
Tom, you start tomorrow.

121
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,562
There you go. Now you have
nothing to feel guilty about.

122
00:06:46,822 --> 00:06:47,822
Right.

123
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,340
Right.

124
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,130
{\pos(192,210)}Thanks again for the tv.

125
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,023
{\pos(192,210)}You guys have been way too generous.

126
00:06:59,126 --> 00:07:00,603
{\pos(192,210)}You made scones.

127
00:07:00,773 --> 00:07:04,196
{\pos(192,210)}- My favorite.
- I know. Take as many as you like.

128
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:05,966
{\pos(192,210)}So...

129
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:07,875
{\pos(192,210)}What did you want to see me about?

130
00:07:09,617 --> 00:07:12,384
I wanted to give you this
donation for the building fund.

131
00:07:12,554 --> 00:07:15,310
{\pos(192,210)}And I also have some things
in the garage for the rummage sale,

132
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,324
{\pos(192,200)}and I am also available

133
00:07:17,494 --> 00:07:20,179
{\pos(192,200)}to run the next
sunday school pancake breakfast.

134
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:24,142
{\pos(192,210)}Good heavens.
What a wonderful display

135
00:07:24,312 --> 00:07:25,518
of christian charity.

136
00:07:26,486 --> 00:07:28,062
I just want to do my part.

137
00:07:29,685 --> 00:07:32,587
{\pos(192,210)}Does this have anything to do
with the plane crash?

138
00:07:33,937 --> 00:07:35,549
{\pos(192,210)}In a manner of speaking.

139
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,239
Do you want to talk about it?

140
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:41,492
{\pos(192,210)}I can't. It would change
how you feel about me.

141
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,951
{\pos(192,210)}I've known you for years.
I don't think that's possible.

142
00:07:47,573 --> 00:07:48,624
I had an affair.

143
00:07:50,675 --> 00:07:51,896
Are you okay?

144
00:07:54,203 --> 00:07:56,642
{\pos(192,210)}Before you confess a sin that big,

145
00:07:57,241 --> 00:07:59,135
Just try to wait
till I've swallowed.

146
00:08:02,673 --> 00:08:04,467
{\pos(192,210)}Who was the affair with?

147
00:08:06,004 --> 00:08:07,191
Karl Mayer.

148
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,440
He was killed in the plane crash.
The same one that injured Orson.

149
00:08:12,855 --> 00:08:15,234
{\pos(192,210)}You must feel terribly guilty
about this.

150
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,126
I can't eat. I can't sleep.

151
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:21,688
That's why I wanted you
to come over here.

152
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:25,129
I have to do something
to make this right.

153
00:08:25,845 --> 00:08:28,265
Seems to me the first step
is for you and Orson

154
00:08:28,435 --> 00:08:30,671
to get into
our marriage outreach program.

155
00:08:30,841 --> 00:08:33,575
It's too late for that.
We're about to get a divorce.

156
00:08:33,745 --> 00:08:37,016
But this was before Orson
was in a wheelchair, right?

157
00:08:37,638 --> 00:08:38,642
Yes.

158
00:08:39,433 --> 00:08:42,607
I think you know what you need
to do to atone for this sin.

159
00:08:42,777 --> 00:08:45,024
You knew it
before I walked in the door.

160
00:08:45,696 --> 00:08:48,569
You want me to bring Orson home
and take care of him?

161
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,658
It's just that I'm not
sure that I love him anymore.

162
00:08:57,256 --> 00:08:59,321
There's a quote I've always loved.

163
00:09:01,006 --> 00:09:04,668
"You cannot make yourself feel
something that you do not feel,

164
00:09:05,141 --> 00:09:08,631
"but you can make yourself
do right in spite of your feelings."

165
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:13,006
- I don't remember that from the Bible.
- It's from Pearl Buck.

166
00:09:13,176 --> 00:09:14,804
I am allowed to read other books.

167
00:09:16,484 --> 00:09:20,267
No matter what you feel about Orson,
if you don't help him now,

168
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,286
you won't be able
to live with yourself.

169
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:26,089
Fine.

170
00:09:27,074 --> 00:09:29,091
I'll tell Orson tomorrow,

171
00:09:29,621 --> 00:09:31,070
and I'll bring him home.

172
00:09:31,757 --> 00:09:32,757
Good.

173
00:09:34,445 --> 00:09:36,116
I think you've had enough.

174
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,707
- Hold up.
- Hey. What's going on?

175
00:09:44,241 --> 00:09:47,628
Eddie's doing stand-up at
the Chuckle Zone on open Mike Night.

176
00:09:48,556 --> 00:09:49,556
Stand-up?

177
00:09:50,158 --> 00:09:51,252
As in comedy?

178
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,504
People are always
telling me how funny I am,

179
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:55,941
so I decided to give
the people what they want.

180
00:09:56,108 --> 00:09:58,482
Don't miss out. I got this
whole riff about airline food.

181
00:09:58,652 --> 00:09:59,719
It's gonna kill.

182
00:10:01,608 --> 00:10:02,608
Hold up!

183
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:07,190
When they tell him he's funny
doesn't he realize they're being funny?

184
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,854
Tell me you're going.
I can't be the only one there.

185
00:10:10,732 --> 00:10:13,232
I'll try. I actually gotta pack.

186
00:10:13,828 --> 00:10:17,069
My dad left me some money, so
I'm going back east to see my cousins.

187
00:10:17,531 --> 00:10:18,654
For how long?

188
00:10:20,074 --> 00:10:22,422
Until they catch the guy
who attacked me,

189
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:24,536
I just don't feel safe here.

190
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,123
I get that.

191
00:10:30,347 --> 00:10:32,210
I've been wanting
to ask you something.

192
00:10:32,909 --> 00:10:34,880
I heard you were in the hospital

193
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,146
because of an overdose.

194
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:41,874
You didn't do that because of...

195
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,630
I was dealing with a lot of stuff...

196
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,359
problems with my parents,
having to move again.

197
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,724
I got really lonely.

198
00:10:52,655 --> 00:10:55,025
And I guess you were part of it.

199
00:10:57,787 --> 00:10:58,977
I'm better now.

200
00:11:01,467 --> 00:11:02,467
Good.

201
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,036
Life has its low points, and we
just have to deal with them.

202
00:11:07,576 --> 00:11:08,999
Speaking of which,

203
00:11:09,707 --> 00:11:11,249
how do we get out of this?

204
00:11:14,396 --> 00:11:16,495
Your timing is impeccable,

205
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:20,550
because it just so happens that
we have an opening right now.

206
00:11:20,962 --> 00:11:23,123
Yes, we heard, and we're so excited.

207
00:11:23,293 --> 00:11:25,693
Everyone know, thhis is
the best private school in town.

208
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,833
It says here that you have been
homeschooling Juanita.

209
00:11:29,508 --> 00:11:31,108
How's that been going?

210
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:35,503
It's been so rewarding spending
time with my little angel.

211
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,401
It breaks my heart to see it end.

212
00:11:38,661 --> 00:11:41,529
Anyway, here's her lunch. It's
all packed. We'll pick her up at 4:00.

213
00:11:43,739 --> 00:11:45,169
Wait, just a second.

214
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:48,829
There are a few other families
on the waiting list before you.

215
00:11:51,116 --> 00:11:54,262
- There are?
- Yes, but Susan Delfino

216
00:11:54,432 --> 00:11:56,795
gave you such
a glowing recommendation.

217
00:11:57,568 --> 00:11:59,176
And to be quite frank,

218
00:11:59,346 --> 00:12:02,176
we could use a little more
diversity in this school.

219
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:05,637
It's been quite a long time since we've
had a little girl of Mexican descent.

220
00:12:07,414 --> 00:12:09,609
We are very proud of our heritage...

221
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:12,732
but Juanita can stand on her own merits.
She's very bright.

222
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,985
And I know I'm biased, but I
do think she's a budding young genius.

223
00:12:17,454 --> 00:12:18,942
I'm Mexican?

224
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:26,491
- Honey, what did you just say?
- He called me Mexican.

225
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,119
You are Mexican, honey.
You know that.

226
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,913
Since when?
I thought we were American.

227
00:12:34,404 --> 00:12:37,127
Yes, but our ancestors
came from <i>Mexico.</i>

228
00:12:38,734 --> 00:12:39,734
Really?

229
00:12:39,901 --> 00:12:43,574
So we're like those people who
sell oranges on the side of the road?

230
00:12:45,502 --> 00:12:48,757
- You're busy. We should go.
- Thank you very much for your time.

231
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:52,482
And, again, we really want to join
you and help with that diversity thing,

232
00:12:52,652 --> 00:12:54,152
so just let us know.

233
00:12:56,593 --> 00:12:58,839
<i>- Just say it.
- I don't even know what that means.</i>

234
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:00,109
<i>Just say it!</i>

235
00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:11,306
{\-------PUB---------}This is fine.
Thank you.

236
00:13:13,691 --> 00:13:15,374
Thank you for agreeing to see me.

237
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,585
I called a few times,
but you didn't pick up.

238
00:13:19,336 --> 00:13:20,660
I had no idea.

239
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:24,341
My phone was in my pants pocket,
and I had it on vibrate.

240
00:13:24,601 --> 00:13:27,323
{\pos(140,268)}And as you may have noticed, I...

241
00:13:29,478 --> 00:13:31,264
{\pos(140,268)}So how's rehab?

242
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,800
{\pos(140,268)}Painful.

243
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:36,645
{\pos(125,268)}The doctor says with a lot of hard work,
you maybe able to walk again someday.

244
00:13:36,905 --> 00:13:39,474
Yes, they're very upbeat
and optimistic.

245
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:42,317
I want to run them over
with this chair.

246
00:13:43,678 --> 00:13:45,556
So...
Why are you here?

247
00:13:46,973 --> 00:13:50,935
I know we've been through a lot, but
it would be best for you to come home

248
00:13:51,105 --> 00:13:52,820
so I can take care of you.

249
00:13:55,843 --> 00:13:58,713
I'd rather be cared for
by a flatulent helper monkey.

250
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,006
I know you're angry,
but I'm still your wife.

251
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:03,830
Apparently we have different
definitions of the word "wife."

252
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,632
I am proceeding with the divorce.

253
00:14:06,117 --> 00:14:09,181
I don't understand. Three weeks ago
you were begging me for another chance.

254
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:13,118
- What happened?
- Karl Mayer happened.

255
00:14:13,773 --> 00:14:17,185
I could forgive you If you betrayed
me with anyone remotely admirable,

256
00:14:17,445 --> 00:14:20,939
but you chose the most
contemptible man I have ever known.

257
00:14:22,992 --> 00:14:24,307
I do not need you.

258
00:14:36,623 --> 00:14:40,208
I'm having a ramp built, and I've turned
the downstairs study into your bedroom.

259
00:14:40,575 --> 00:14:43,967
You're coming home where you belong,
and that's all there is to it.

260
00:14:44,137 --> 00:14:47,292
You can start forgiving me,
and I'll start forgiving you.

261
00:14:52,272 --> 00:14:54,478
I suggest you start first.

262
00:14:58,251 --> 00:15:01,855
How could you not know you're Mexican?
We eat Mexican all the time.

263
00:15:02,315 --> 00:15:04,941
We eat Chinese food, too.
Does that mean I'm Chinese?

264
00:15:05,201 --> 00:15:07,235
No, that just means
your mother hates to cook.

265
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,702
Apparently, we have to
spell everything out for you.

266
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,735
You do know you're a girl, right?

267
00:15:17,902 --> 00:15:20,269
What? Half the women
in your family have mustaches.

268
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:22,250
It could be very confusing.

269
00:15:24,938 --> 00:15:27,088
Juanita, go inside
and play with your sister.

270
00:15:28,048 --> 00:15:30,550
And while you're at it,
tell her she's Mexican, too!

271
00:15:33,344 --> 00:15:34,618
I can't believe it.

272
00:15:34,788 --> 00:15:37,940
We had that school right in our hands.
How could we let it get away?

273
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,144
The bigger question is how did we let
our daughter thinking she's white?

274
00:16:02,123 --> 00:16:05,543
Sorry I'm late. I had to pick up some
lumber to build that ramp for Orson.

275
00:16:05,713 --> 00:16:07,824
What a good person you are.

276
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:10,300
I need to pay the paperboy tomorrow.

277
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,343
- Do you have any cash?
- I think I have a $20 on me.

278
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,764
Wouldn't you rather...

279
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,599
Stick it in here?

280
00:16:20,597 --> 00:16:23,019
Couldn't we leave it in the mailbox,
like we usually do?

281
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:26,731
I just thought that's the
way you do it down at Double D's.

282
00:16:27,475 --> 00:16:28,525
Double D's?

283
00:16:28,952 --> 00:16:31,778
Turns out Karl was a part owner
and left me his share.

284
00:16:32,383 --> 00:16:33,405
By the way,

285
00:16:34,223 --> 00:16:36,074
"Destiny" says hello.

286
00:16:37,822 --> 00:16:39,619
I see where you're going with this.

287
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:43,081
Do you, Mike Delfino?
That's what she calls you.

288
00:16:43,758 --> 00:16:45,500
Because that's my name.

289
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,886
No one hanging from a pole
should know your name.

290
00:16:49,056 --> 00:16:50,964
That place is one of my accounts.

291
00:16:51,224 --> 00:16:52,549
I'm their plumber.

292
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:56,480
And that's it? You go there just
to do the plumbing and nothing else?

293
00:16:57,292 --> 00:17:00,060
Liar! Destiny said you had
a beer there the other night.

294
00:17:01,922 --> 00:17:04,692
Sometimes when I finish the job,
I'll have a beer.

295
00:17:05,395 --> 00:17:07,621
And you never look at the girls?

296
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:13,260
- It's completely innocent.
- I don't buy that.

297
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:16,842
I want to see the "completely
innocent" look you have

298
00:17:17,012 --> 00:17:19,561
when Destiny shakes her tassels
in your face.

299
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:21,453
So I've gone to a strip club.

300
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,793
Are we gonna laugh about this,
or make it a thing?

301
00:17:24,331 --> 00:17:26,166
I am leaning towards "thing."

302
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,417
Fine. If it bothers you that much,

303
00:17:28,587 --> 00:17:31,184
next time I finish a job there,
I'll come right home.

304
00:17:31,354 --> 00:17:34,550
You don't have to worry, because
you won't be working there anymore.

305
00:17:34,717 --> 00:17:35,717
I forbid it.

306
00:17:37,731 --> 00:17:38,928
You forbid it?

307
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:42,018
What kind of marriage is this?

308
00:17:42,685 --> 00:17:45,690
The kind where the husband
wants to look at strippers

309
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,640
and the wife forbids it.

310
00:17:48,939 --> 00:17:49,944
I love you.

311
00:17:50,348 --> 00:17:53,148
I have never cheated on you
and I never will.

312
00:17:53,995 --> 00:17:57,145
But you're not gonna tell me
what I can or can't do.

313
00:18:00,174 --> 00:18:01,874
Let me get this straight...

314
00:18:02,934 --> 00:18:05,334
You forbid Mike
from going to a strip club?

315
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,750
I know it was a little heavy-handed,
but I just can't stand those places.

316
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:12,233
What's the big whoop? Carlos takes
clients to the strip club all the time.

317
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,723
I've been to one...

318
00:18:13,998 --> 00:18:15,465
the Ass Menagerie.

319
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:19,246
It was my brother's bachelor party.
This stripper named Cinnamon

320
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,637
gave me a lap dance.

321
00:18:21,449 --> 00:18:24,812
Luckily, if I squinted just enough,
she looked like a young Ricky Schroder.

322
00:18:24,982 --> 00:18:27,233
See, this is the reason
men go to those places...

323
00:18:27,403 --> 00:18:29,437
so they can fantasize.
We all do it.

324
00:18:29,697 --> 00:18:32,065
You fantasize about other men
when you're with Carlos?

325
00:18:32,325 --> 00:18:34,095
Carlos has been
so many different men,

326
00:18:34,262 --> 00:18:36,569
I'm surprised when
I open my eyes and it's Carlos.

327
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,189
Wanna know who I fantasize about?

328
00:18:40,422 --> 00:18:42,742
Not necessarily.
Anyone want more wine?

329
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:44,202
Tom Scavo.

330
00:18:44,831 --> 00:18:45,833
Wine now.

331
00:18:46,518 --> 00:18:47,997
4th of July barbecue.

332
00:18:48,257 --> 00:18:49,582
Those tan shorts.

333
00:18:49,842 --> 00:18:51,392
I am there right now.

334
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,672
Could we please get back
to the issue at hand?

335
00:18:56,354 --> 00:18:59,173
Bottom line is you cannot
forbid a man to go to strip clubs.

336
00:18:59,343 --> 00:19:01,538
Don't expect him to
understand why it bothers you.

337
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:03,805
That's just the way they are.
Right?

338
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,801
Sorry. I was just imagining
Ricky Schroder...

339
00:19:08,971 --> 00:19:11,073
wearing Tom Scavo's shorts.

340
00:19:17,543 --> 00:19:19,704
{\---------PUB--------}Are you sure you want
to just give away your CDs?

341
00:19:19,874 --> 00:19:21,986
The more you take,
the less I have to pack.

342
00:19:22,156 --> 00:19:24,184
In fact,
is there anything else you want?

343
00:19:24,351 --> 00:19:25,437
Anything?

344
00:19:27,614 --> 00:19:28,792
How about...

345
00:19:29,338 --> 00:19:30,414
Danny Bolen?

346
00:19:30,955 --> 00:19:32,703
He's not really mine to give.

347
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,710
Come on.
He's totally into you,

348
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:38,140
{\pos(130,268)}Which is a complete mystery to me.

349
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,033
{\pos(140,268)}You know what? I think
I'm just gonna keep my CDs.

350
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,391
{\pos(140,268)}I didn't mean it like that.
It's just you don't seem interested,

351
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:47,097
{\pos(140,268)}and I have sent every signal
I can think of.

352
00:19:47,357 --> 00:19:50,564
{\pos(140,268)}- Why are you so hung up on Danny?
- He's hot.

353
00:19:52,603 --> 00:19:56,026
Here's the thing, Danny's
in kind of a fragile place right now.

354
00:19:56,294 --> 00:19:58,150
He doesn't need
to get his heart broken.

355
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:01,290
I'm not gonna snag him
just to toss him aside.

356
00:20:01,714 --> 00:20:02,988
I don't use people.

357
00:20:05,533 --> 00:20:07,420
I used some people.

358
00:20:08,054 --> 00:20:09,688
But I wouldn't use him.

359
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,391
Are you sure?

360
00:20:14,335 --> 00:20:16,717
I think we have a lot in common,
and if he'd just spend

361
00:20:16,887 --> 00:20:19,298
a little time with me,
he'd realize that.

362
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,967
You like stand-up comedy?

363
00:20:25,605 --> 00:20:27,855
Too bad.
We're gonna go see Eddie.

364
00:20:35,104 --> 00:20:36,354
Sorry I'm late.

365
00:20:37,108 --> 00:20:38,987
- How was work?
- Crazy.

366
00:20:40,137 --> 00:20:42,411
I had three conference calls

367
00:20:42,578 --> 00:20:45,378
and a 2-hour client
meeting with Gary Danner.

368
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:48,347
- How was your day?
- Even crazier.

369
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:50,833
I peed twice in every
bathroom in the house.

370
00:20:51,468 --> 00:20:52,468
What's that?

371
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,546
Little matching outfits
for the twins

372
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:59,091
that people gave us.
I thought I'd give them to charity.

373
00:21:00,488 --> 00:21:02,538
I ran into the Petersons today.

374
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,514
They just heard, wanted
to see how you were.

375
00:21:08,147 --> 00:21:09,835
So Gary Danner...

376
00:21:10,386 --> 00:21:12,312
He's a prickly S.O.B.

377
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,720
Tell me about it.

378
00:21:15,887 --> 00:21:18,026
Check out this proposal
I worked up for him.

379
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:25,962
- What do you mean, "hmm"?
- I'm glad you showed this to me.

380
00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:29,329
I know Danner. And trust me,
you do not want to go down this road.

381
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,874
- Why not?
- Don't worry. I can fix it.

382
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,979
- Where's a pen?
- Wait... Actually...

383
00:21:34,146 --> 00:21:36,712
I showed it to Danner today.
He loved it.

384
00:21:37,647 --> 00:21:38,964
Gary Danner liked this?

385
00:21:39,357 --> 00:21:40,924
No, he loved it,

386
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:44,888
But not as much as Carlos. He told me
it was the best written proposal

387
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:46,889
he has ever seen, bar none.

388
00:21:48,358 --> 00:21:50,934
- What's for dinner?
- Meat loaf.

389
00:21:55,138 --> 00:21:56,207
What's wrong?

390
00:21:56,374 --> 00:21:59,151
Nothing. It's... Well,
that's quite a compliment.

391
00:22:00,609 --> 00:22:02,988
Not to mention a bit of a slam
on the work that I did.

392
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,160
Honey, he's just encouraging me.

393
00:22:05,327 --> 00:22:08,227
I don't think he was
thinking about you at all.

394
00:22:09,582 --> 00:22:11,949
By the way, this meat loaf...

395
00:22:12,213 --> 00:22:14,113
The best I have ever tasted.

396
00:22:14,825 --> 00:22:16,293
Bar none?
Just eat.

397
00:22:25,623 --> 00:22:27,473
It's coming along beautifully.

398
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,764
Thanks. So,
when's Orson coming home?

399
00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:32,434
It's still a bit up in the air.

400
00:22:34,018 --> 00:22:36,108
But I guess now would be
a good time to call him

401
00:22:36,275 --> 00:22:38,575
and let him know we're almost ready.

402
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,450
Orson Hodge's room, please.

403
00:22:44,575 --> 00:22:47,025
Would you stop
hammering for a moment?

404
00:22:49,423 --> 00:22:50,673
He checked out?

405
00:22:51,232 --> 00:22:53,904
But that's impossible.
Where would he have gone?

406
00:22:54,071 --> 00:22:56,291
- Mike, please.
- It's not me.

407
00:23:01,042 --> 00:23:03,142
Never mind. I think I found him.

408
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:09,486
Oh, boy. The fat's in the fire now.

409
00:23:10,863 --> 00:23:12,098
What is going on here?

410
00:23:12,348 --> 00:23:14,643
The husband you're
divorcing has found new digs.

411
00:23:15,118 --> 00:23:16,770
Before you jump down my throat...

412
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:18,909
Roy and I are on fixed incomes.

413
00:23:19,076 --> 00:23:21,072
You can't blame us for
taking in a boarder,

414
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:23,383
especially one who can't
get to the second story.

415
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,195
That's our naked floor.

416
00:23:33,214 --> 00:23:34,579
What are you doing here?

417
00:23:35,984 --> 00:23:37,534
Enjoying my new home.

418
00:23:38,157 --> 00:23:39,672
It's rather quaint,

419
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:42,420
once you get used to the smell
of denture cream and scotch.

420
00:23:45,238 --> 00:23:46,438
Don't mind me.

421
00:23:47,834 --> 00:23:50,512
Just making sure you don't
slap a guy in a wheelchair.

422
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:54,391
So how are you planning
to pay your rent?

423
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,485
Well, I'm a bit cash-strapped
at the moment, but,

424
00:23:57,652 --> 00:23:59,262
Karen knows I'm good for it.

425
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:02,732
Once he gets his divorce settlement,
he's writing me a big, fat check.

426
00:24:03,548 --> 00:24:06,509
So how long are we talking?
A month, two?

427
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,359
There will be no divorce, and
if he tries to file for one,

428
00:24:10,526 --> 00:24:13,007
there will be delays,
motions and appeals.

429
00:24:13,174 --> 00:24:16,074
It could take years for
him to ever see a dime.

430
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,974
Your wife loves you. Go home.

431
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:25,222
Stop right now. Do you hear me?

432
00:24:28,386 --> 00:24:30,539
So am I taking down the ramp?

433
00:24:30,825 --> 00:24:31,825
Leave it.

434
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,237
You'll need it soon enough.

435
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,007
Almost home, dear.

436
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:39,374
Mike, call the police. My
wife is holding me hostage!

437
00:24:39,692 --> 00:24:41,692
We've all been there, big guy.

438
00:24:47,838 --> 00:24:50,103
{\--------PUB--------}{\pos(192,220)}I had an appointment with
my O.B. around the corner,

439
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,438
{\pos(192,220)}and I just thought
I'd stop by and say hi.

440
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,042
{\pos(192,220)}I also wanted to

441
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,320
{\pos(192,220)}thank you for being so nice to

442
00:24:57,687 --> 00:24:59,539
Tom, our little temp.

443
00:24:59,896 --> 00:25:01,625
- How's he doing?
- He's amazing.

444
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,838
It's okay, Carlos.
You can tell me the truth.

445
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,467
He's knocking my socks off.
Everybody is so impressed.

446
00:25:11,212 --> 00:25:12,719
Well, good.

447
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,554
{\pos(140,268)}Good, good, good.

448
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,221
{\pos(140,268)}I'm so proud of him.

449
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:19,434
{\pos(140,268)}But when I drop this kid,
Tom's out on his ass, right?

450
00:25:20,426 --> 00:25:22,062
{\pos(140,268)}- Excuse me?
- I love him and

451
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:26,028
{\pos(140,268)}I'm glad he's doing well here,
but this is my job.

452
00:25:26,195 --> 00:25:28,735
At some point,
I'm gonna want it back.

453
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:31,071
And I say that as the woman

454
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:34,616
who dove in front of a spinning
propeller to save your child's life.

455
00:25:37,351 --> 00:25:39,201
Of course this is your job.

456
00:25:40,061 --> 00:25:42,958
And you can have it
back any time you want.

457
00:25:44,352 --> 00:25:45,961
Well, that's all I needed to hear.

458
00:25:47,139 --> 00:25:49,047
It's just that I was
under the impression

459
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,616
you were planning to stay
at home with your baby.

460
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,400
And why would you be
under that impression?

461
00:25:59,855 --> 00:26:01,100
That's what Tom said.

462
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,022
What exactly did tom say?

463
00:26:07,735 --> 00:26:10,360
I really don't want to get
in the middle of this.

464
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,495
Carlos, I saved
a member of your family.

465
00:26:12,662 --> 00:26:14,989
It doesn't mean I can't
take another one out.

466
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:21,005
And you can train a dog to do
almost anything, but you can't do,

467
00:26:21,172 --> 00:26:22,850
you can't do with cats and... cats.

468
00:26:23,017 --> 00:26:26,328
And did you ever try to get a cat
to fetch? They're like, you know,

469
00:26:26,495 --> 00:26:30,171
they won't do it.
Stupid cats. Am I right, people?

470
00:26:34,621 --> 00:26:37,053
You guys have been great.
Good night.

471
00:26:37,957 --> 00:26:39,869
Give it up for Eddie Orlofsky

472
00:26:40,036 --> 00:26:41,286
Come on, folks!

473
00:26:45,132 --> 00:26:47,098
So, what do you think?

474
00:26:48,577 --> 00:26:52,026
I never realized there were so many
differences between dogs and cats.

475
00:26:52,957 --> 00:26:54,570
That's why I'm the comic, babe.

476
00:26:57,097 --> 00:26:59,047
I'm off to get my free drink.

477
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,480
I left my jacket in
the car. Walk me out?

478
00:27:08,647 --> 00:27:10,797
Jacket? It's hot as hell in here.

479
00:27:13,973 --> 00:27:15,423
Now I feel a chill.

480
00:27:25,546 --> 00:27:27,145
I gotta use the bathroom.

481
00:27:29,002 --> 00:27:30,731
Okay, what is your problem?

482
00:27:31,267 --> 00:27:32,275
Excuse me?

483
00:27:32,668 --> 00:27:35,625
Whenever we're alone together,
you find some reason to bail.

484
00:27:35,792 --> 00:27:37,238
Why aren't you into me?

485
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:41,066
Ana, there's not a lot
of room to be into you.

486
00:27:41,233 --> 00:27:43,161
Because of how much you're into you.

487
00:27:43,967 --> 00:27:45,788
You did not just call me conceited.

488
00:27:46,038 --> 00:27:48,458
Chill. It's not like
I asked you to spell it.

489
00:27:49,607 --> 00:27:50,857
I'm not stupid,

490
00:27:51,024 --> 00:27:53,880
and I am definitely not
the attention whore at this table.

491
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,217
I heard about your little
stunt with the pills.

492
00:28:00,986 --> 00:28:02,486
Okay, that was mean.

493
00:28:03,022 --> 00:28:04,432
I'm sorry that I said that.

494
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,727
Don't be sorry.

495
00:28:08,894 --> 00:28:09,896
You're right.

496
00:28:15,137 --> 00:28:16,694
I like the blunt Ana

497
00:28:17,248 --> 00:28:18,898
more than the cute Ana.

498
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:22,917
So...

499
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,950
you think I'm cute?

500
00:28:31,847 --> 00:28:33,747
You're home. Perfect timing.

501
00:28:33,991 --> 00:28:37,800
- Margaritas. What's the occasion?
- We're getting drunk, Mexican style.

502
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:39,917
Principal Hobson just called,

503
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,240
and Juanita got accepted
to Oakridge.

504
00:28:42,407 --> 00:28:45,160
- Seriously?
- I am free from homeschooling.

505
00:28:45,327 --> 00:28:47,257
No more fighting, no more threats,

506
00:28:47,427 --> 00:28:50,377
and no more parent-teacher
conferences with you.

507
00:28:55,364 --> 00:28:58,361
- Come on. Start guzzlin'.
- I don't think she should go.

508
00:29:06,577 --> 00:29:08,329
I've been thinking about it all day.

509
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:11,249
- Let's keep her in public school.
- We can't. She was expelled.

510
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,777
I made some calls.
Jefferson elementary can take her.

511
00:29:13,944 --> 00:29:15,420
That's way out in my pleasant.

512
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,194
And there's a lot of Latino families
that live in that area.

513
00:29:18,361 --> 00:29:21,133
So what? We have a much better
school right here in our backyard.

514
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:24,940
I'm not schlepping way over there
just so she can be with those people.

515
00:29:26,226 --> 00:29:27,542
"Those" people?

516
00:29:28,121 --> 00:29:29,934
Don't you mean "our" people?

517
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:33,855
Our people are
the rich private school people.

518
00:29:34,613 --> 00:29:37,358
Oh, my God. I know exactly
what is going on here.

519
00:29:37,852 --> 00:29:40,987
- What?
- You are ashamed of being Mexican.

520
00:29:41,535 --> 00:29:43,864
- That's insane.
- No, it totally makes sense.

521
00:29:44,031 --> 00:29:45,575
All of our friends are white.

522
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,911
You didn't want me
to teach the girls Spanish.

523
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:51,372
Because I don't understand it, I didn't
want you guys plotting behind my back.

524
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,705
When we bought this house
and I said we would be

525
00:29:53,872 --> 00:29:55,948
the only Mexicans{\ in the neighborhood},
you remember what you said?

526
00:29:56,115 --> 00:29:58,229
- "Fine by me."
- You're right. It's my fault.

527
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:01,300
I should have told the realtor,
"Forget square footage and central air.

528
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,936
Find us something next
door to a Mariachi bar."

529
00:30:04,103 --> 00:30:06,846
Deny it all you want.
You are a self-hating Mexican.

530
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:10,367
- Well, you're a self-wiping Mexican.
- What does that mean?

531
00:30:20,921 --> 00:30:22,696
{\--------PUB--------}Traffic was insane.

532
00:30:24,261 --> 00:30:26,783
Is there any dinner left?
I haven't eaten since lunch.

533
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:33,149
- Everything okay?
- I talked to Carlos today.

534
00:30:34,356 --> 00:30:35,375
{\pos(140,268)}About what?

535
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:39,055
{\pos(140,268)}He was under the impression
that when I have this baby,

536
00:30:39,222 --> 00:30:41,222
{\pos(140,268)}I'll be staying home with her.

537
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,926
{\pos(140,268)}Where would he get a
crazy idea like that?

538
00:30:46,429 --> 00:30:47,554
I told him.

539
00:30:49,027 --> 00:30:50,515
You're not even denying it?

540
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,351
I thought it might be
in your best interest.

541
00:30:53,967 --> 00:30:54,967
Seriously?

542
00:30:55,862 --> 00:30:58,648
You know how much
that job means to me.

543
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,354
You know how much I hate
being a stay-at-home Mom.

544
00:31:02,521 --> 00:31:04,571
How could you think
I'd be okay with this?

545
00:31:05,078 --> 00:31:07,339
Because we lost a baby.

546
00:31:13,803 --> 00:31:16,374
Honey, I thought you might want
to stay home with this one,

547
00:31:17,593 --> 00:31:20,503
because she's all the more precious,
given what happened.

548
00:31:23,327 --> 00:31:25,258
So that's how I'm supposed to feel.

549
00:31:26,326 --> 00:31:30,180
I don't know how you feel Lynette,
because you never talk about it.

550
00:31:30,866 --> 00:31:33,539
It's been a month.
Every time I try to bring it up,

551
00:31:33,706 --> 00:31:36,102
- you change the subject.
- Because I'm dealing with it.

552
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,313
Shouldn't we
be dealing with it together?

553
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,120
You want to talk about this?

554
00:31:40,287 --> 00:31:42,642
Fine! We lost a kid,
we'll never meet him.

555
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:44,969
We'll spend the rest of
our lives looking at one,

556
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:46,964
always wondering
why there aren't two.

557
00:31:47,131 --> 00:31:49,681
How can saying this
out loud be helpful?

558
00:31:55,909 --> 00:31:57,559
You're right. It's not.

559
00:32:01,437 --> 00:32:02,437
You win.

560
00:32:04,148 --> 00:32:05,848
After you have the baby,

561
00:32:06,365 --> 00:32:07,634
go back to your job.

562
00:32:10,249 --> 00:32:11,249
Thank you.

563
00:32:16,729 --> 00:32:18,879
You want me to fix you something?

564
00:32:20,326 --> 00:32:21,940
I'm not hungry anymore.

565
00:32:28,671 --> 00:32:31,824
<i>Now remember, fellas,
these ladies don't work for free.</i>

566
00:32:38,744 --> 00:32:39,916
Long time no see.

567
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,327
I got the call about
your John being backed up.

568
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:45,046
What? No, our bathrooms
are working just fine.

569
00:32:45,466 --> 00:32:48,174
That's weird. Some woman called
and said it was an emergency.

570
00:32:50,133 --> 00:32:52,634
I'm sorry, man.
I don't know what to tell you.

571
00:32:52,801 --> 00:32:55,352
<i>All right, it's time to introduce</i>

572
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,607
<i>our newest double D doll...</i>

573
00:32:57,959 --> 00:32:59,417
<i>Miss Fix-it!</i>

574
00:33:09,149 --> 00:33:10,349
What the hell?

575
00:33:19,018 --> 00:33:21,749
- What are you doing here?
- What the hell are you doing?

576
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,854
Well, since I'm one of the owners,

577
00:33:26,348 --> 00:33:28,923
I figured I should
really learn the business,

578
00:33:29,365 --> 00:33:31,024
from my bottom up.

579
00:33:32,266 --> 00:33:35,016
You mind?
I'm trying to make a deposit here.

580
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,569
Will you come down
from there right now?

581
00:33:39,736 --> 00:33:41,536
Why? They're just looking.

582
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,855
It's completely innocent. Right?

583
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:50,504
Hey, pal. Sit down. I didn't come here
to see the back of your head.

584
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:52,780
This is not funny.

585
00:33:53,891 --> 00:33:56,951
I can't talk. I've got a room full
of Neanderthals to entertain.

586
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:06,140
- What are you doing?
- Just giving people what they want.

587
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:12,383
Don't you dare. Susan, I'm serious.
I want you off of that stage right now.

588
00:34:12,997 --> 00:34:15,345
Wait. Are you forbidding
me from doing something?

589
00:34:16,974 --> 00:34:19,095
I thought we didn't have
that kind of marriage.

590
00:34:19,262 --> 00:34:22,060
Very cute. If I have to, I will
carry you out of here myself.

591
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,803
What exactly is the problem, Mike?

592
00:34:34,549 --> 00:34:36,824
Okay. I get it. I will never...

593
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:38,326
come back here.

594
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,265
Let's go home, Mrs. Fix-it.

595
00:34:47,812 --> 00:34:49,662
Wait. Wait. Forgot my tips!

596
00:35:22,337 --> 00:35:24,037
{\--------PUB--------}What are you looking at?

597
00:35:24,367 --> 00:35:26,885
Nothing. Just some old photos.

598
00:35:29,231 --> 00:35:31,131
I didn't know you had these.

599
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:33,589
We couldn't afford frames,

600
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,789
so my dad would put these
on the wall with tape.

601
00:35:38,913 --> 00:35:40,013
Is that you?

602
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,000
I was about 5.

603
00:35:44,014 --> 00:35:45,114
You're cute.

604
00:35:45,523 --> 00:35:47,923
But that toolshed's
seen better days.

605
00:35:49,421 --> 00:35:50,871
That was our house.

606
00:35:59,017 --> 00:36:00,067
It's funny.

607
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,619
I'm smiling in all of
these photos, but...

608
00:36:04,851 --> 00:36:06,251
I hated that town.

609
00:36:08,076 --> 00:36:10,876
Everybody was so poor.
Everybody was Mexican.

610
00:36:13,727 --> 00:36:16,527
Back then I thought
they were the same thing.

611
00:36:18,272 --> 00:36:21,871
And even though I was only 5,
I knew I wanted out.

612
00:36:25,531 --> 00:36:27,643
And you can call it
self-loathing, Carlos, but,

613
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,800
I just...

614
00:36:30,052 --> 00:36:33,131
don't want my kids to ever
know I lived like that.

615
00:36:38,401 --> 00:36:39,701
That's your dad.

616
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,151
He was so strong.

617
00:36:46,551 --> 00:36:48,719
I would run to meet him
when he'd come home

618
00:36:48,886 --> 00:36:52,038
from working in the factories,
and he'd lift me up on his shoulders.

619
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,061
I loved that.

620
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,531
I bet he did, too.

621
00:37:00,381 --> 00:37:03,481
I used to ask him, "Papa,
why do you work so much?"

622
00:37:04,878 --> 00:37:06,692
And he would say, "so one day

623
00:37:06,859 --> 00:37:09,059
we can live in a beautiful house."

624
00:37:12,551 --> 00:37:13,901
But we never did.

625
00:37:18,641 --> 00:37:19,891
But you do now.

626
00:37:24,101 --> 00:37:26,051
Your father had dreams, Gaby,

627
00:37:26,441 --> 00:37:30,141
but they were for you, and
he sacrificed a lot to get you here.

628
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,827
Whatever our children
achieve in life,

629
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,645
it's because of dreams that started

630
00:37:39,812 --> 00:37:42,812
on the shoulders of a
proud, strong, Mexican man.

631
00:37:44,983 --> 00:37:48,383
That is why I want our kids
to know where they came from.

632
00:37:52,786 --> 00:37:54,136
I want that, too.

633
00:38:07,881 --> 00:38:08,881
So...

634
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:11,998
How do your physical
therapists think you're doing?

635
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:18,045
Do they think
you're making progress?

636
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:29,724
Orson, it's been three days. You're
gonna have to talk to me sometime.

637
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:33,269
I know why you're doing this, Bree.

638
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,982
Reverend Sykes stopped by
to check on my progress.

639
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:40,364
He was very proud of himself

640
00:38:40,531 --> 00:38:43,531
for convincing you to
take me on as charity work.

641
00:38:44,301 --> 00:38:45,901
It's not charity work.

642
00:38:46,973 --> 00:38:49,199
When I had that affair,
I didn't just betray you.

643
00:38:49,366 --> 00:38:50,786
I betrayed my faith as well.

644
00:38:51,868 --> 00:38:55,041
So please, you have to let me
help you or I am...

645
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,168
Or you won't get into heaven?

646
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,548
Didn't realize how
much this means to you.

647
00:39:05,312 --> 00:39:07,712
I guess I can find
a way to be happy.

648
00:39:08,781 --> 00:39:10,531
Thank you so much, Orson.

649
00:39:11,401 --> 00:39:13,851
I am gonna take
such good care of you.

650
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,024
By the way, my soup is cold.

651
00:39:21,852 --> 00:39:22,852
Well,

652
00:39:23,254 --> 00:39:24,445
mine is hot.

653
00:39:25,701 --> 00:39:27,101
You can have this.

654
00:39:35,681 --> 00:39:37,875
While you're up, could you
get me a glass of wine?

655
00:39:39,391 --> 00:39:40,821
Yes, of course.

656
00:39:41,781 --> 00:39:43,481
And perhaps for dessert,

657
00:39:43,871 --> 00:39:46,171
some of your delicious Crme brle.

658
00:39:46,664 --> 00:39:48,719
Orson, that takes over
an hour to prepare...

659
00:39:49,423 --> 00:39:51,623
Well, I would do it myself, but...

660
00:40:02,103 --> 00:40:04,153
And we're out of vanilla beans.

661
00:40:05,211 --> 00:40:07,461
You might have to run to the store.

662
00:40:29,191 --> 00:40:30,734
<i>The act itself</i>

663
00:40:30,901 --> 00:40:32,402
<i>is quite simple...</i>

664
00:40:33,095 --> 00:40:35,348
<i>You strip away the outer layer</i>

665
00:40:35,576 --> 00:40:38,001
<i>and reveal what's underneath.</i>

666
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:40,194
<i>Of course,</i>

667
00:40:40,361 --> 00:40:44,137
<i>sometimes the results
can be quite surprising.</i>

668
00:40:46,184 --> 00:40:49,602
<i>If you strip away the veneer
of happy domesticity,</i>

669
00:40:50,244 --> 00:40:52,275
<i>you may find grief.</i>

670
00:40:54,305 --> 00:40:56,994
<i>If you strip away
that facade of wealth,</i>

671
00:40:57,921 --> 00:41:00,195
<i>you may find self-loathing.</i>

672
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:06,010
<i>If you strip away
the veil of helplessness,</i>

673
00:41:07,122 --> 00:41:09,694
<i>you may find cruelty.</i>

674
00:41:12,419 --> 00:41:14,290
<i>Yes, stripping</i>

675
00:41:14,457 --> 00:41:16,545
<i>can be a dangerous pastime.</i>

676
00:41:18,561 --> 00:41:20,611
<i>But for a lucky few,</i>

677
00:41:21,186 --> 00:41:22,700
<i>it can also be...</i>

678
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,502
<i>a lot of fun.</i>
