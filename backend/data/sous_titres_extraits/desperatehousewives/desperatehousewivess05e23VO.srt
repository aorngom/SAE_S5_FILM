<i>Previously on
</i>Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:02,423 --> 00:00:04,588
- We're getting married.
- <i>One proposal</i>

3
00:00:04,758 --> 00:00:06,140
<i>led to another.</i>

4
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,217
- We're with immigration.
- <i>But the law gets in the way.</i>

5
00:00:09,387 --> 00:00:11,178
Can't this wait?
We're about to get married.

6
00:00:11,348 --> 00:00:12,358
Not today.

7
00:00:12,793 --> 00:00:14,676
<i>A break-in was staged...</i>

8
00:00:15,253 --> 00:00:17,102
Orson, we've been robbed.

9
00:00:17,272 --> 00:00:20,675
<i>In an attempt to hide
assets in a divorce.</i>

10
00:00:21,195 --> 00:00:24,854
- After the crash...
- <i>The truth about the accident came out.</i>

11
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:27,433
Mike told 'em that he was
driving, but it wasn't true.

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,965
<i>The thing you have to
understand about Dave Williams.</i>

13
00:00:38,135 --> 00:00:40,368
<i>Is he wanted to be forgiven.</i>

14
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:44,197
<i>That's why he made the videotape.</i>

15
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:49,948
I didn't want to kill M.J. Delfino.

16
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:52,421
I <i>had</i> to.

17
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:02,518
Susan Mayer killed
my wife and daughter.

18
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:07,249
The police called it an accident.

19
00:01:09,205 --> 00:01:11,026
But I don't believe a person

20
00:01:11,944 --> 00:01:14,140
who takes two precious lives

21
00:01:14,487 --> 00:01:16,360
should be allowed to just

22
00:01:17,074 --> 00:01:18,198
walk away.

23
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,777
I know some people will wonder,

24
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:24,231
why didn't I just kill Susan?

25
00:01:25,482 --> 00:01:27,708
But what good would that have done?

26
00:01:28,017 --> 00:01:29,670
She'd be dead.
There'd be no...

27
00:01:31,214 --> 00:01:32,191
suffering.

28
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,084
And to those who hate me
because I took the life

29
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,559
of an innocent young boy, I say...

30
00:01:42,773 --> 00:01:43,853
Crap.

31
00:01:50,162 --> 00:01:51,091
<i>Yes,</i>

32
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:54,775
<i>Dave Williams wanted
everyone to forgive him...</i>

33
00:01:56,131 --> 00:01:59,390
Look, I got a new tackle box
for our trip on Saturday.

34
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:02,450
<i>But not until he finished doing</i>

35
00:02:03,046 --> 00:02:05,018
<i>the unforgivable.</i>

39
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:21,065
<i>was destroyed by a suspicious fire,</i>

40
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:24,324
<i>one body was left unclaimed.</i>

41
00:02:25,303 --> 00:02:28,218

00:02:28,987 --> 00:02:31,456
<i>"John Doe A-37."</i>

43
00:02:32,687 --> 00:02:35,583
<i>For months,
they tried to identify him.</i>

44
00:02:36,985 --> 00:02:38,308
<i>Then one day,</i>

45
00:02:38,478 --> 00:02:41,192
<i>they got a call from an impound lot.</i>

46
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:44,475
<i>It seems a car had
been towed from the club parking lot</i>

47
00:02:44,645 --> 00:02:46,062
<i>the night of the fire--</i>

48
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,663
<i>a Sedan that had been rented</i>

49
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,440
<i>to a Dr. Samuel Heller from Boston,</i>

50
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:57,051
<i>who had been reported
missing four months earlier.</i>

51
00:02:58,633 --> 00:03:02,407
<i>The doctor's dental
records confirmed their theory.</i>

52
00:03:03,964 --> 00:03:06,811
<i>His receptionist, however, did not.</i>

53
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:08,574
No way.

54
00:03:09,503 --> 00:03:11,830
Dr. Heller did not die in that fire.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,774
- Ma'am, we've got his dental records.
- I don't care.

56
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,014
You said
the fire was four months ago?

57
00:03:17,184 --> 00:03:19,563
I've gotten texts
from him since then.

58
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,011
You have?

59
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,951
The last one was
just a few weeks ago.

60
00:03:27,562 --> 00:03:29,628
Maybe we should send a text back.

61
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:32,267
You have your phone with you?

62
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,624
- I was gonna call you.
- You were?

63
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:51,733
Did you say something to M.J.
about going on that fishing trip?

64
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,274
I did.

65
00:03:53,444 --> 00:03:56,501
I know how depressed you've been since
Jackson was deported, so I thought,

66
00:03:56,671 --> 00:04:00,268
now is the perfect time for the
three of us to go up to the lake. And...

67
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,228
I got M.J. his own little life vest.

68
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,625
I wish I could, but I can't.
I'm worried about Jackson.

69
00:04:08,795 --> 00:04:11,147
All the more reason.
You know what they say about fishing--

70
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,706
it's nature's tranquilizer.

71
00:04:15,998 --> 00:04:18,666
I haven't heard from
Jackson since he was taken away,

72
00:04:18,836 --> 00:04:20,644
and I just wanna be here
in case he calls.

73
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:23,376
That's okay.
Just bring your cell phone.

74
00:04:23,859 --> 00:04:26,056
I'd just feel more comfortable
if I'm close by.

75
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,710
That's crazy.

76
00:04:28,997 --> 00:04:31,542
Jackson wouldn't want you sittin'
around here worrying about him.

77
00:04:31,712 --> 00:04:32,888
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,143
We'll go fishing another time.

79
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:40,524
Don't you think you're being
a little selfish here?

80
00:04:41,102 --> 00:04:42,445
And what about M.J.?

81
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,616
You wanna go fishing,
don't you, buddy?

82
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:49,361
What are you doing?

83
00:04:49,531 --> 00:04:51,627
I just told you I can't go.

84
00:04:52,612 --> 00:04:54,096
I'm just thinking about M.J.

85
00:04:55,886 --> 00:04:57,163
He'll be fine.

86
00:05:00,804 --> 00:05:01,991
You know what?

87
00:05:02,605 --> 00:05:04,669
You're right.
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:05,634 --> 00:05:06,843
It's just a trip.

89
00:05:19,521 --> 00:05:22,876
You're not listening! Six months
in Europe would be educational.

90
00:05:23,046 --> 00:05:25,683
You know what would be more educational?
You going to college.

91
00:05:25,853 --> 00:05:28,853
I've already been in school
for 12 years already.

92
00:05:29,852 --> 00:05:32,837
- I need a vacation.
- Based on your last few report cards,

93
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:35,257
you've already <i>been</i> on vacation.

94
00:05:35,427 --> 00:05:38,317
I'm gonna be 18. If I wanna
go to Europe, I'll go to Europe.

95
00:05:40,057 --> 00:05:43,576
Good luck paying for it, because
if you so much as apply for a passport,

96
00:05:43,746 --> 00:05:46,005
- we're cuttin' you off.
- Cut off from the mighty Scavo

97
00:05:46,175 --> 00:05:48,337
family fortune? Oh, no!

98
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:52,195
Tom, why didn't you
help me out there?

99
00:05:52,365 --> 00:05:55,416
Because I agree with him.

100
00:05:55,586 --> 00:05:58,782
- What?
- He's young. He should be having fun.

101
00:05:59,306 --> 00:06:01,719
Look at me. I'm a middle-aged
man reading the want ads

102
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:04,851
for jobs that I'll never get. I should've
gone to Europe when I had the chance.

103
00:06:05,021 --> 00:06:06,091
Focus.

104
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:09,668
Our son is throwing his life away.

105
00:06:09,838 --> 00:06:11,655
We have got to keep him on track.

106
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:15,417
What is so great about the track?
I was on it.

107
00:06:15,587 --> 00:06:18,577
I did everything I was supposed to.
It chewed me up and spit me out.

108
00:06:18,747 --> 00:06:21,313
I know you're discouraged,

109
00:06:21,483 --> 00:06:24,387
but letting our son
make a huge mistake

110
00:06:24,557 --> 00:06:28,090
- is not gonna help anything.
- Even if it is a huge mistake,

111
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,408
you got to let people make some
decisions about their own life.

112
00:06:31,578 --> 00:06:34,754
- Your way is not the only way.
- I am just trying to help Preston

113
00:06:34,924 --> 00:06:37,925
avoid the way marked
"unemployable loser."

114
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,169
Fine.
What do you want me to do?

115
00:06:43,726 --> 00:06:47,009
I want you to get this stupid
Europe idea out of his head.

116
00:06:47,179 --> 00:06:50,933
Take him on the campus. Get him excited.
Show him college could be fun.

117
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:52,563
Sure.

118
00:06:54,723 --> 00:06:58,109
On the way home, I'll show my college
diploma to the guy at the Burger Barn.

119
00:06:59,063 --> 00:07:01,851
They're hiring a new
fry cook for the night shift.

120
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:07,973
If you're really stopping by there,
bring home some onion rings.

121
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:11,291
Mommy, what are you doing?

122
00:07:11,461 --> 00:07:13,886
We're going to a family reunion
at Aunt Connie's,

123
00:07:14,056 --> 00:07:15,397
and I want to look my best.

124
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:16,772
Is it gonna be fun?

125
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:22,475
If your idea of a good time is sitting
on rusty lawn chairs in the driveway

126
00:07:22,645 --> 00:07:25,611
eating lard the shaped fried chicken,
then yeah! It's gonna be a blast.

127
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,607
The driveway?

128
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:29,266
Honey, you're 6 now,

129
00:07:29,436 --> 00:07:32,885
so I think it's time we had
a little mother/daughter talk.

130
00:07:33,922 --> 00:07:37,076
Your father's side of the
family's trash. Any questions?

131
00:07:37,637 --> 00:07:40,348
If you don't like her, why
are you putting on your best jewelry?

132
00:07:40,518 --> 00:07:43,093
'Cause that's what grownups do.
When we don't like someone,

133
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:46,126
we don't punch them
or say mean things.

134
00:07:46,486 --> 00:07:49,946
We just find subtle ways to
make them feel bad about their lives.

135
00:07:50,525 --> 00:07:53,038
Like these earrings.
Aunt Connie can't afford them,

136
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,906
and that'll make her sad.

137
00:07:55,153 --> 00:07:57,581
And this will bring her
to her knees.

138
00:07:57,932 --> 00:08:00,808
And this will be
a kick in her throat.

139
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,352
If you hate 'em so much,
maybe we shouldn't go.

140
00:08:06,715 --> 00:08:09,141
No, sweetie. We have to go.
They're family.

141
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:14,853
This is why I wanted
to check on my things.

142
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:17,504
You don't leave a valuable
painting on the damn floor.

143
00:08:17,674 --> 00:08:19,630
You need to put something
underneath it.

144
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,281
Fine. How about this ugly doormat?

145
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:26,393
That is not a doormat.
That is a handwoven Kurdish Kazak rug.

146
00:08:29,227 --> 00:08:31,601
You know, Bree,
when I hang out with you,

147
00:08:31,771 --> 00:08:35,635
I realize how little I know
and how much I don't give a crap.

148
00:08:36,284 --> 00:08:37,880
Give me that.

149
00:08:38,173 --> 00:08:40,278
I'm so glad this divorce
is almost over.

150
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:43,913
An obnoxious, unpleasant man
will be out of my life,

151
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,679
and so will Orson.

152
00:08:47,247 --> 00:08:50,690
It's not over yet.
You still got a couple of hurdles.

153
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,861
Has Orson brought up
the insurance claim again?

154
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:55,116
- He thinks I filed it.
- Great.

155
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,287
When he realizes you never did,
you'll be divorced, he'll be broke,

156
00:08:58,457 --> 00:09:00,975
- and it won't matter.
- Yes, and I'll be single again,

157
00:09:01,145 --> 00:09:04,668
and I can concentrate on my business,
maybe do some traveling.

158
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,993
Maybe spend a little time at the
intersection of right leg and left leg,

159
00:09:08,163 --> 00:09:11,761
- if you know what I'm saying.
- Sadly, I always know what you're saying.

160
00:09:11,931 --> 00:09:14,717
If you want, I could set you up.

161
00:09:15,281 --> 00:09:18,345
I know a lot of great guys who
are good for a free dinner.

162
00:09:19,555 --> 00:09:22,938
- And a few laughs.
- Thanks, I'm not even divorced yet,

163
00:09:23,108 --> 00:09:26,482
and once I am, I don't think you'd
be my first choice as a matchmaker.

164
00:09:49,494 --> 00:09:53,079
- Susan, it's me.
- <i>Jackson, I have been so worried.</i>

165
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,338
- Where are you?
- <i>Fairview jail.</i>

166
00:09:55,508 --> 00:09:57,244
They're processing
my deportation papers.

167
00:09:59,318 --> 00:10:01,929
So they're sending you back?
When?

168
00:10:02,321 --> 00:10:03,495
Couple days.

169
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:06,061
<i>I just wanted to call
and say thank you</i>

170
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,769
and tell you that I'll miss you.

171
00:10:11,943 --> 00:10:13,902
I'll miss you, too.

172
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:17,945
You came in my life when I
was going through a really hard time,

173
00:10:18,115 --> 00:10:21,305
and you were amazing.
<i>I mean, you are amazing.</i>

174
00:10:21,932 --> 00:10:23,603
- You, too.
- <i>So...</i>

175
00:10:23,983 --> 00:10:27,181
Did the immigration people
tell you how they found out about you?

176
00:10:27,351 --> 00:10:28,513
<i>Anonymous tip.</i>

177
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,981
Although it's pretty obvious
who "anonymous" is.

178
00:10:32,909 --> 00:10:35,143
Does Mike really
think I'm that stupid?

179
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:39,908
- You think Mike did this?
- <i>Who else?</i>

180
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:42,176
Mike and Katherine were
the only people who knew.

181
00:10:42,346 --> 00:10:44,869
Katherine was doing cartwheels
about us getting married, so...

182
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:49,060
But, this doesn't make any sense because
Mike knew that it wasn't for real.

183
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,931
Real or not, he had the look
of a guy who's not ready to give you up.

184
00:10:54,574 --> 00:10:55,579
Time's up.

185
00:10:57,184 --> 00:10:58,462
I gotta go.

186
00:10:58,632 --> 00:11:01,238
I'll try and call you again
before I leave.

187
00:11:23,248 --> 00:11:25,089
How was the campus tour?

188
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,566
Fantastic.

189
00:11:27,363 --> 00:11:29,638
That school is amazing.

190
00:11:30,739 --> 00:11:34,511
The professors are so engaged,
and the kids were open and friendly.

191
00:11:34,681 --> 00:11:37,349
- Really?
- Yeah. It was inspiring.

192
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,047
- You were so right to send us.
- Good.

193
00:11:40,217 --> 00:11:43,027
I knew if you saw the campus,
you'd have a change of heart.

194
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,992
Me? Nah.
I'm still going to Europe.

195
00:11:50,597 --> 00:11:53,039
What was that? I thought
you said the tour was fantastic.

196
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,883
Preston still needs
a little convincing.

197
00:11:57,765 --> 00:11:59,239
But I don't.

198
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:03,718
I'm going back to school.

199
00:12:04,946 --> 00:12:06,181
What's that now?

200
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,654
I know it's a little
out of left field,

201
00:12:08,824 --> 00:12:10,702
but walking across the quad,

202
00:12:10,872 --> 00:12:13,056
I felt so alive.

203
00:12:13,226 --> 00:12:17,219
I spoke with someone in admissions, all
I have to do is pass an entrance exam.

204
00:12:19,049 --> 00:12:20,448
So...

205
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:24,786
You would be a college student...

206
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:26,111
Again.

207
00:12:28,397 --> 00:12:30,491
25 years after the first time.

208
00:12:31,002 --> 00:12:33,761
But this time--focused.

209
00:12:33,931 --> 00:12:36,968
This time, knowing exactly
what I wanna major in.

210
00:12:37,932 --> 00:12:40,961
- Which is?
- Chinese.

211
00:12:42,801 --> 00:12:44,200
Chinese?

212
00:12:44,551 --> 00:12:46,063
Chinese?

213
00:12:46,508 --> 00:12:48,246
As in "moo goo gai pan" Chinese?

214
00:12:48,995 --> 00:12:52,504
What's he gonna do with that, watch
Bruce Lee movies without the subtitles?

215
00:12:53,496 --> 00:12:57,374
We didn't get that far.
I felt faint, and he left to go buy

216
00:12:57,685 --> 00:13:00,077
- a backpack.
- Lynette, that's bad.

217
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:04,077
It's just so random,
and the worst part is

218
00:13:04,247 --> 00:13:06,035
if I point that out, I'm a bitch.

219
00:13:06,391 --> 00:13:09,513
Why is that?
When did being practical and realistic

220
00:13:09,683 --> 00:13:11,448
become synonymous with bitchiness?

221
00:13:11,618 --> 00:13:14,895
The first time a man did something
stupid, and a woman pointed it out.

222
00:13:15,065 --> 00:13:18,476
I know Tom. He's going to learn
how to count to ten in Chinese,

223
00:13:18,646 --> 00:13:22,463
then he'll get bored and move on to
his new dream of becoming a beekeeper.

224
00:13:22,723 --> 00:13:25,455
Then you have no choice.
Bite the bullet and bitch.

225
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,841
No, she has a choice. It's
entirely possible to get what you want

226
00:13:29,011 --> 00:13:31,259
without being perceived of
as a nagging shrew.

227
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:35,565
Please, Sensei, instruct me
in your ancient ways.

228
00:13:36,546 --> 00:13:38,841
The key is to not let them
know what you're doing.

229
00:13:39,011 --> 00:13:42,151
This requires observation,
cunning and manipulation.

230
00:13:43,177 --> 00:13:46,229
Isn't it just easier to shut
down your hoo-ha until he gives in?

231
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,858
I think that Bree is right-- that the
more Tom sees you digging in your heels,

232
00:13:50,028 --> 00:13:51,609
the more he's gonna wanna do it.

233
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:54,748
So you wait for an opportunity
that you can use to your advantage

234
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,495
while at the same time
appearing supportive.

235
00:13:57,956 --> 00:14:01,246
That's your advice? Hope
an opportunity just drops in my lap?

236
00:14:01,838 --> 00:14:04,826
Might as well start shopping
for beekeeper suits.

237
00:14:09,657 --> 00:14:12,117
You guys, I'm sorry.
I gotta run.

238
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:18,318
- I need to talk to Mike.
- He's in the shower,

239
00:14:18,488 --> 00:14:21,351
- but I'll tell him you stopped by.
- No need. I'll wait.

240
00:14:30,847 --> 00:14:32,433
Orson, I'm home.

241
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,804
Have a seat.

242
00:15:03,515 --> 00:15:05,430
So there never was a robbery.

243
00:15:06,678 --> 00:15:10,002
You took these things,
hoping to hide them from me.

244
00:15:11,492 --> 00:15:14,568
And though I've tried to come up
with a reason, I can't.

245
00:15:15,101 --> 00:15:17,424
So I'm forced to ask
the question why.

246
00:15:17,594 --> 00:15:19,661
Why would you do such a thing?

247
00:15:22,846 --> 00:15:24,893
I want a divorce.

248
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:30,770
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

249
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:35,159
You're entitled to half of everything
we've acquired during the marriage,

250
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:37,874
so I was trying to
hide some of those things,

251
00:15:38,219 --> 00:15:40,662
since--let's face it--
I paid for them.

252
00:15:42,112 --> 00:15:43,835
You've already hired a lawyer?

253
00:15:44,005 --> 00:15:47,063
Yes, but I'm tired of all the lying and
the sneaking around, so I'll inform him

254
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:48,849
that you can have whatever you like.

255
00:15:49,725 --> 00:15:51,120
I don't want a divorce.

256
00:15:52,303 --> 00:15:54,096
That part's non-negotiable.

257
00:15:54,547 --> 00:15:56,209
Can't we at least talk about this?

258
00:15:57,388 --> 00:15:58,824
There's no point.

259
00:15:59,955 --> 00:16:03,617
So you should get a piece
of paper, start to make a list

260
00:16:04,817 --> 00:16:07,447
of what it is you wish
to take with you.

261
00:16:09,031 --> 00:16:12,044
So you don't want any of it?

262
00:16:15,294 --> 00:16:17,013
All I want is out.

263
00:16:31,141 --> 00:16:34,052
He might be a while.
Sure I can't help you?

264
00:16:34,222 --> 00:16:36,154
No, I need to talk to Mike.

265
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,241
You could flush the toilet
and try to get him out of there.

266
00:16:44,676 --> 00:16:46,056
You seem upset.

267
00:16:47,043 --> 00:16:48,254
Something happened?

268
00:16:50,978 --> 00:16:52,912
Did Mike turn Jackson in
to immigration?

269
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:56,579
- No. Why would he do that?
- I don't know.

270
00:16:56,962 --> 00:16:58,173
Jealousy?

271
00:16:58,506 --> 00:17:00,506
Jackson thinks Mike
is still hung up on me.

272
00:17:02,552 --> 00:17:05,417
Trust me, Susan.
Mike did not turn Jackson in.

273
00:17:06,061 --> 00:17:07,447
Shower's off.

274
00:17:07,617 --> 00:17:10,364
- I guess we'll know in a few seconds.
- Listen...

275
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,566
Mike couldn't have
called immigration

276
00:17:13,114 --> 00:17:17,072
because I never told him that Jackson
was marrying you for a green card.

277
00:17:18,641 --> 00:17:21,085
Somebody did,
because he sent me a text

278
00:17:21,255 --> 00:17:22,908
agreeing to keep paying me alimony.

279
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:24,878
That was me.

280
00:17:26,358 --> 00:17:27,606
I sent it.

281
00:17:29,568 --> 00:17:33,088
- Are you insane? Why would you do...
- Mike has asked me to marry him.

282
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,409
- What?
- And I was afraid that if he found out

283
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:39,030
that you weren't really
in love with Jackson,

284
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,430
that he might
change his mind about me.

285
00:17:42,016 --> 00:17:44,105
Katherine, that is...

286
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,878
It's totally unfair to Mike.

287
00:17:48,048 --> 00:17:49,611
He needs to know the truth.

288
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,525
I can make him happy, Susan.

289
00:17:52,964 --> 00:17:54,902
He just needs to get over you.

290
00:17:55,561 --> 00:17:56,699
Katherine?

291
00:17:58,017 --> 00:17:59,713
Please, don't ruin this.

292
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:05,245
You wanna just order in?

293
00:18:08,965 --> 00:18:10,421
I'm glad you're here.

294
00:18:11,145 --> 00:18:12,694
I have something I wanna tell you.

295
00:18:15,557 --> 00:18:17,792
Katherine already told me
about your big news.

296
00:18:26,386 --> 00:18:28,968
I hope we have your blessing.

297
00:18:34,092 --> 00:18:35,388
Yes, sure.

298
00:18:38,414 --> 00:18:39,645
Why not?

299
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:46,620
I'm sorry.

300
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,995
I <i>was</i> gonna tell you myself.

301
00:19:02,805 --> 00:19:06,197
Don't be mad at Katherine.
We all know that she just can't...

302
00:19:06,805 --> 00:19:08,166
keep a secret.

303
00:19:17,943 --> 00:19:20,222
This place is looking
worse than ever.

304
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,447
Aunt Connie's salons
haven't been doing so well.

305
00:19:22,617 --> 00:19:26,468
You should take off some diamonds. You're
gonna make her feel bad about herself.

306
00:19:26,638 --> 00:19:27,949
Say no more.

307
00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:33,190
Aunt Connie's like a second mother
to me. Why do you hate her so much?

308
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,169
All she ever does is put me down.
If you'd pay attention, you'd see.

309
00:19:38,015 --> 00:19:40,370
There's my Carlos!

310
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,253
Hi, <i>Tía.</i>

311
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:45,638
Are these the girls?

312
00:19:46,842 --> 00:19:48,936
They're so grown up!

313
00:19:49,775 --> 00:19:51,550
And, Gaby...

314
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,749
Is it just me, or do you get
more beautiful every time I see you?

315
00:20:00,034 --> 00:20:01,311
It's not just you.

316
00:20:01,707 --> 00:20:03,002
Come here. Give me a hug.

317
00:20:03,584 --> 00:20:04,870
Let me see your palms.

318
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,289
Come on in!
The whole family's here.

319
00:20:15,459 --> 00:20:19,011
And I've made some
of my world-famous tamales.

320
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:25,619
Aunt Connie seems nice.

321
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:28,276
- Maybe she's changed.
- Trash don't change, sweetheart.

322
00:20:28,446 --> 00:20:30,009
She's up to something.

323
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,611
Come on, let's go grab a lawn chair

324
00:20:32,781 --> 00:20:35,743
before we get stuck
on the grass with the fire ants.

325
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:42,380
<i>Tom Scavo, this is Mr. Cummings.</i>

326
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,190
<i>We met during your
tour of the campus.</i>

327
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,485
<i>Forgive me, but I gave you the
wrong date for the admissions test.</i>

328
00:20:47,655 --> 00:20:50,912
<i>It's tomorrow at 8:00 A.M.
So get a good night's sleep,</i>

329
00:20:51,082 --> 00:20:53,598
<i>and we'll see you first
thing in the morning.</i>

330
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,890
Help! Help!

331
00:20:56,475 --> 00:20:59,011
- I'm coming.
- It goes... there.

332
00:20:59,273 --> 00:21:00,266
So...

333
00:21:00,436 --> 00:21:04,327
I was thinking this whole
going back to school thing

334
00:21:07,047 --> 00:21:08,896
deserves a little celebration.

335
00:21:09,939 --> 00:21:12,419
Really? I didn't think
you were on board.

336
00:21:12,994 --> 00:21:14,547
I wanna be supportive.

337
00:21:15,748 --> 00:21:18,897
Let's go for a nice dinner,
get a bottle of wine...

338
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,436
Maybe two, since we don't have
to wake up early tomorrow.

339
00:21:22,792 --> 00:21:26,785
Or we can go to that Mexican
place that has those great margaritas.

340
00:21:27,431 --> 00:21:29,308
You and tequila?

341
00:21:30,738 --> 00:21:32,109
What a great idea.

342
00:21:34,217 --> 00:21:37,307
Okay, everybody,
I need you to gather around.

343
00:21:37,477 --> 00:21:39,410
Aunt Connie has something to say.

344
00:21:41,074 --> 00:21:42,737
Gaby, come on.
My <i>Tía's</i> waiting.

345
00:21:42,907 --> 00:21:45,335
Let her wait. I need something to drink.
I trying to keep down

346
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:47,762
one of her world-famous tamales.

347
00:21:48,939 --> 00:21:51,174
Thank you all so much
for coming today.

348
00:21:51,689 --> 00:21:55,201
It's been so long
since we've been together.

349
00:21:55,866 --> 00:21:57,424
We love you, Aunt Connie.

350
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,728
And I love all of you.

351
00:21:59,898 --> 00:22:02,239
There's nothing
more important than family.

352
00:22:02,867 --> 00:22:05,332
And now I have
an announcement to make.

353
00:22:05,704 --> 00:22:09,645
As many of you know, I've battled
a weak heart for most of my life.

354
00:22:10,657 --> 00:22:12,375
And the doctor now tells me

355
00:22:12,545 --> 00:22:15,871
that I may only have
a few months left.

356
00:22:21,444 --> 00:22:24,230
Sorry. Bad heart. Floor's all yours.

357
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,822
As some of you know, I've
been taking care of my granddaughter,

358
00:22:28,205 --> 00:22:30,061
my beautiful Ana.

359
00:22:31,205 --> 00:22:32,951
Because of my condition,

360
00:22:33,121 --> 00:22:36,129
I can't do it anymore,
and I need someone to take her in.

361
00:22:40,543 --> 00:22:43,096
I realize that this is a lot to ask.

362
00:22:43,266 --> 00:22:47,257
We would love to help out,
but Miguel just lost his job.

363
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,303
We're barely scraping by.

364
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:51,012
I understand.

365
00:22:51,347 --> 00:22:54,946
Obviously, it has to be someone
who can afford to do this.

366
00:22:56,926 --> 00:23:00,533
We wish we could,
but we've got such a full house.

367
00:23:00,703 --> 00:23:02,921
Maybe it should be someone
who doesn't have kids.

368
00:23:05,365 --> 00:23:08,385
I know this is not gonna
be easy, but we're family,

369
00:23:08,802 --> 00:23:11,223
and this is what we do
for each other.

370
00:23:14,515 --> 00:23:17,332
You know,
we're still gonna be family tomorrow,

371
00:23:17,702 --> 00:23:21,463
so I think we should
think about it overnight

372
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:23,608
and search our hearts,

373
00:23:23,821 --> 00:23:27,799
and try to figure out which
one of your homes is best for Ana.

374
00:23:31,217 --> 00:23:32,673
Gabrielle's right.

375
00:23:32,843 --> 00:23:36,244
And please know that I won't
judge any of you harshly

376
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:39,592
if you decide that you
cannot take care of my beautiful

377
00:23:39,762 --> 00:23:41,010
granddaughter.

378
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:45,742
We love you, Aunt Connie!

379
00:24:05,393 --> 00:24:06,925
What are you doing?

380
00:24:07,095 --> 00:24:08,437
I'm helping.

381
00:24:08,722 --> 00:24:10,652
I don't need any help.
And besides,

382
00:24:10,822 --> 00:24:13,657
my Parisian salad
doesn't call for any chives.

383
00:24:14,623 --> 00:24:17,362
Yes. I've always thought
it was a bit bland.

384
00:24:17,677 --> 00:24:21,651
I think the chives will give it
the bite it's so sorely lacking.

385
00:24:22,431 --> 00:24:25,016
My salad has plenty of bite.

386
00:24:29,943 --> 00:24:30,994
So...

387
00:24:31,164 --> 00:24:32,510
when are you moving out?

388
00:24:33,313 --> 00:24:35,078
Actually, I'm not.

389
00:24:35,526 --> 00:24:37,470
- Excuse me?
- I've decided to stay

390
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,136
so we can work on our marriage.
Am I cutting these too fine?

391
00:24:41,461 --> 00:24:44,473
I understand this is a shock,
but you have to face facts.

392
00:24:44,643 --> 00:24:46,770
Our marriage is over.

393
00:24:47,978 --> 00:24:50,813
Once you weigh what's at stake,
I think you'll change your mind.

394
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:53,924
I you're referring
to the financial settlement,

395
00:24:54,094 --> 00:24:55,797
I already told you,
I don't care anymore.

396
00:24:55,967 --> 00:24:58,487
Actually,
I'm referring to your freedom.

397
00:24:58,848 --> 00:25:02,192
I've been to jail, Bree.
Trust me, you wouldn't last ten seconds.

398
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,754
- Jail?
- Yes, of course.

399
00:25:04,924 --> 00:25:06,663
Insurance fraud is a serious crime.

400
00:25:07,317 --> 00:25:09,208
But I never filed
an insurance claim.

401
00:25:09,861 --> 00:25:10,828
But <i>I</i> did.

402
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:16,308
- What?!
- Yes, I thought we were robbed.

403
00:25:16,478 --> 00:25:19,269
So, of course, I did the
responsible thing and reported it...

404
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:21,330
on both our behalves.

405
00:25:21,726 --> 00:25:25,551
And since you rather carelessly
rented the storage unit

406
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,945
under your own name, I think the police
will find me completely blameless.

407
00:25:30,115 --> 00:25:32,199
You would actually
send your wife to prison?

408
00:25:32,369 --> 00:25:35,861
My wife? No.
My ex-wife? You bet.

409
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:38,101
But it won't come to that, darling.

410
00:25:38,384 --> 00:25:41,201
I know we can get back
to what we both once had.

411
00:25:43,452 --> 00:25:44,964
That will never happen.

412
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:47,285
And sure we've had our challenges--

413
00:25:47,455 --> 00:25:50,635
Your penchant for emasculation,
my kleptomania.

414
00:25:50,805 --> 00:25:52,621
But every marriage
has its ebb and flow.

415
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:55,592
Orson, please don't do this.

416
00:25:57,413 --> 00:25:59,310
I don't love you.

417
00:26:03,637 --> 00:26:05,365
That's all right, darling.

418
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,025
I have enough love
for the both of us.

419
00:26:14,219 --> 00:26:15,816
Not bland anymore.

420
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,748
The girls are sacked out.
Can we talk now?

421
00:26:29,918 --> 00:26:33,846
What's there to talk about? You won't
even let the girls get a golden retriever,

422
00:26:34,016 --> 00:26:37,073
- and now you wanna take in a teenager?
- It's not about what I want.

423
00:26:37,243 --> 00:26:40,721
It's about doing the right thing.
This is what family does for each other.

424
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:44,380
Luckily, it's a big family.
Let her go live with Nina and Luis.

425
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,343
- They have eight kids.
- What's one more?

426
00:26:46,513 --> 00:26:49,311
- They'll never know the difference.
- You're being selfish.

427
00:26:49,594 --> 00:26:53,295
No, I'm thinking about <i>our</i>
children. They're <i>so</i> happy.

428
00:26:53,465 --> 00:26:56,652
Taking in a kid we don't
even know? That's a huge risk.

429
00:26:57,378 --> 00:27:00,015
It's the same risk my Aunt
Connie took for me and my mother.

430
00:27:01,343 --> 00:27:04,561
When my father left, Mamá and I
had nowhere else to turn.

431
00:27:04,969 --> 00:27:07,752
Aunt Connie opened her home to us.
She saved us from the streets.

432
00:27:07,922 --> 00:27:10,841
Yeah, and knowing Aunt Connie,
She's waited all these years

433
00:27:11,011 --> 00:27:13,886
to call that favor in.
She's probably dying on purpose.

434
00:27:16,328 --> 00:27:18,141
We are so blessed.

435
00:27:18,915 --> 00:27:22,272
This is a chance for us to give back.
Maybe God gave me back my sight

436
00:27:22,442 --> 00:27:24,488
and all this money
so I could help my family.

437
00:27:26,662 --> 00:27:27,892
Think about it.

438
00:27:28,711 --> 00:27:30,636
If something happened to us,

439
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,105
wouldn't you <i>want</i> someone
to do this for our two girls?

440
00:27:40,991 --> 00:27:42,774
Easy.
You're a little drunk there.

441
00:27:42,944 --> 00:27:46,854
- That's 'cause I love you, Lynette!
- I love you, too, baby. Here you go.

442
00:27:47,024 --> 00:27:49,834
- And I love you, Preston.
- I'm Porter.

443
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:53,428
I could never tell you two apart.

444
00:27:53,783 --> 00:27:55,774
But you're my favorite.

445
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:01,475
How come you let me drink
so many margaritas?

446
00:28:01,743 --> 00:28:04,429
And why did we have
to stay till closing?

447
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,044
- It's almost 2:00.
- Who cares what time it is?

448
00:28:07,214 --> 00:28:09,759
We were celebrating a big change
in your dad's life.

449
00:28:11,516 --> 00:28:13,845
Someone called.

450
00:28:14,164 --> 00:28:15,989
<i>Tom Scavo, this is Mr. Cummings.</i>

451
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,978
<i>We met during your
tour of the campus.</i>

452
00:28:18,148 --> 00:28:21,820
<i>Forgive me, but I gave you the
wrong date for the admissions test.</i>

453
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,152
<i>It's tomorrow at 8:00 A.M.</i>

454
00:28:26,619 --> 00:28:28,309
I gotta crap for that test!

455
00:28:49,217 --> 00:28:50,635
They're on to you.

456
00:28:53,585 --> 00:28:56,939
Those messages you sent to
my receptionist didn't fool anybody.

457
00:28:59,165 --> 00:29:01,628
They've identified my body, and now

458
00:29:02,197 --> 00:29:03,778
they're trying to trap you.

459
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:09,492
- It's not gonna work.
- They can trace those signals, Dave.

460
00:29:11,129 --> 00:29:12,791
They're going to find you.

461
00:29:18,527 --> 00:29:19,804
It's too late.

462
00:29:20,722 --> 00:29:22,253
Whatever plan you had,

463
00:29:22,547 --> 00:29:24,824
it went to hell when you killed me.

464
00:29:25,704 --> 00:29:27,430
You should've stayed on your meds.

465
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,691
You don't know
what you're talking about.

466
00:29:29,861 --> 00:29:32,681
- I'm getting away with this.
- Why would you want to?

467
00:29:33,613 --> 00:29:35,088
I don't mean to criticize,

468
00:29:35,258 --> 00:29:37,091
but I thought you were
doing this for us.

469
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:44,159
I am.

470
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:47,969
I want justice for our family.

471
00:29:48,139 --> 00:29:50,225
Then who cares if you're caught?

472
00:29:50,953 --> 00:29:52,605
We miss you, Dave.

473
00:29:53,346 --> 00:29:55,309
We should be together.

474
00:29:56,571 --> 00:29:57,501
So...

475
00:29:58,293 --> 00:29:59,861
What are you saying?

476
00:30:01,062 --> 00:30:04,442
I should just walk
over and kill M.J. now?

477
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,755
Sure. Why not?

478
00:30:08,622 --> 00:30:11,118
And let's face it, your plan
to take the kid to some lake

479
00:30:11,288 --> 00:30:14,387
and pretend he accidentally drowned?

480
00:30:15,076 --> 00:30:16,512
Boring.

481
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:19,869
Isn't it better than Susan know <i>why</i>

482
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:22,098
her son had to die?

483
00:30:22,592 --> 00:30:25,031
The whole point
is to make her suffer.

484
00:30:25,427 --> 00:30:26,375
Right?

485
00:30:28,832 --> 00:30:30,231
That's true.

486
00:30:30,544 --> 00:30:34,369
And then the whole world
will finally understand

487
00:30:34,629 --> 00:30:36,754
what you've been going through.

488
00:30:55,158 --> 00:30:56,884
That's it!
Good job.

489
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,962
One more just like that.

490
00:31:01,575 --> 00:31:03,773
Can I talk to you a sec?
Yeah. Sure.

491
00:31:06,411 --> 00:31:09,223
- I'll get some juice. You want anything?
- No, thanks.

492
00:31:09,992 --> 00:31:11,204
Look...

493
00:31:12,694 --> 00:31:16,656
I'm sorry if I was a little
under-enthusiastic the other day

494
00:31:17,448 --> 00:31:19,214
about you and Katherine
getting married.

495
00:31:19,899 --> 00:31:22,900
I understand. You just found
out your fiancé was being deported.

496
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,524
The timing kind of sucked.

497
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:27,524
That and...

498
00:31:28,659 --> 00:31:31,083
It did kind of come out of nowhere.

499
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:35,372
- We <i>have</i> been living together.
- I know.

500
00:31:36,924 --> 00:31:39,856
But still... It happened so fast.

501
00:31:41,991 --> 00:31:44,685
I wanna make sure
that you know what you're doing.

502
00:31:47,996 --> 00:31:50,693
I know. And feel free
to throw me out of your house

503
00:31:50,863 --> 00:31:52,515
if I'm out of line...

504
00:31:53,562 --> 00:31:55,064
But do you love her?

505
00:32:02,184 --> 00:32:03,902
Why would you ask that?

506
00:32:05,728 --> 00:32:07,372
Just answer the question.

507
00:32:11,577 --> 00:32:12,648
I love her.

508
00:32:15,306 --> 00:32:16,330
Good.

509
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:19,638
That's all I needed to hear.

510
00:32:22,922 --> 00:32:26,773
I hope that you will
be very happy together.

511
00:32:29,711 --> 00:32:33,105
And I hope everything works out
for you and Jackson.

512
00:32:33,967 --> 00:32:35,873
I don't know if that's gonna happen.

513
00:32:36,753 --> 00:32:39,081
What do you mean?
You two aren't getting married?

514
00:32:39,502 --> 00:32:40,910
Oh, the truth is...

515
00:32:44,343 --> 00:32:46,207
It's complicated.

516
00:32:48,541 --> 00:32:50,652
M.J. told me you were here.

517
00:32:50,822 --> 00:32:52,650
What are you guys talking about?

518
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,178
We were talking about you, actually.

519
00:32:57,438 --> 00:33:00,402
Me? What <i>about</i> me?

520
00:33:03,922 --> 00:33:07,632
I realized that I never
properly congratulated you

521
00:33:07,802 --> 00:33:09,351
on getting married.

522
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:11,525
Really?

523
00:33:15,464 --> 00:33:16,614
Really.

524
00:33:23,555 --> 00:33:26,372
Hey, babe.
How'd the test go?

525
00:33:29,931 --> 00:33:31,400
It's as though...

526
00:33:31,971 --> 00:33:34,238
I dug down deep and I found

527
00:33:34,408 --> 00:33:37,969
a new level of suck
that I never knew I had in me.

528
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:40,639
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

529
00:33:45,034 --> 00:33:47,563
I puked tequila in the parking lot,

530
00:33:47,733 --> 00:33:50,412
I passed out twice
in the essay section,

531
00:33:50,582 --> 00:33:53,906
and I giggled uncontrollably
when I read the word "Uranus."

532
00:33:55,029 --> 00:33:58,582
Add to that that I'm pretty sure
that I spelled "Scavo" wrong,

533
00:33:58,752 --> 00:34:00,410
and it is a safe bet

534
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,826
that I will not be broadening
my horizons anytime soon.

535
00:34:06,485 --> 00:34:08,169
Don't sweat it.

536
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:10,289
You wanted to learn Chinese...

537
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:11,911
We'll get you a book.

538
00:34:13,225 --> 00:34:16,869
Mandarin is a very
complicated language.

539
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:20,286
You can't get the kind of fluency you
need for the professional marketplace

540
00:34:20,456 --> 00:34:21,989
from a book.

541
00:34:24,476 --> 00:34:25,650
Marketplace?

542
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:28,291
That's the whole point.

543
00:34:28,563 --> 00:34:32,243
China is one of the world's
fastest growing economies.

544
00:34:32,413 --> 00:34:35,574
The opportunities for someone
with my marketing experience

545
00:34:35,744 --> 00:34:38,051
who can speak the language
are amazing.

546
00:34:38,221 --> 00:34:41,180
We're talking beaucoup bucks.
I could've totally

547
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,916
reinvented myself.

548
00:34:46,439 --> 00:34:47,601
That's...

549
00:34:48,661 --> 00:34:50,201
a brilliant plan.

550
00:34:52,547 --> 00:34:54,406
Why didn't you tell me this?

551
00:34:56,348 --> 00:34:57,719
What does matter?

552
00:35:00,995 --> 00:35:01,840
It's over.

553
00:35:08,618 --> 00:35:10,064
I'm sorry I let you down.

554
00:35:20,098 --> 00:35:21,863
You're getting married <i>this</i> weekend?

555
00:35:22,193 --> 00:35:25,409
That's the good thing about Vegas.
Doesn't require any planning.

556
00:35:26,483 --> 00:35:30,245
You know what? Why don't you come
with us? You could be my Maid of Honor.

557
00:35:33,482 --> 00:35:34,928
That's ridiculous, isn't it?

558
00:35:35,585 --> 00:35:37,069
It's sweet, but...

559
00:35:37,723 --> 00:35:39,453
Yeah, it's ridiculous.

560
00:35:39,877 --> 00:35:41,480
And besides,

561
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:44,180
M.J. and I have big plans
this weekend.

562
00:36:16,721 --> 00:36:18,003
Glad I caught you.

563
00:36:18,173 --> 00:36:20,488
Is your friend's boat
still available this weekend?

564
00:36:21,924 --> 00:36:23,885
- What?
- I was thinking about what you said,

565
00:36:24,055 --> 00:36:25,651
and you were right.

566
00:36:26,024 --> 00:36:28,475
It really would do me good to
get out of here for a few days.

567
00:36:31,438 --> 00:36:32,471
You're right.

568
00:36:33,372 --> 00:36:35,532
It would do us all some good.

569
00:36:44,854 --> 00:36:48,291
You have no idea
how much this means to me,

570
00:36:48,674 --> 00:36:50,962
knowing that you and Gaby

571
00:36:51,132 --> 00:36:54,247
will be looking after
my beautiful Ana.

572
00:36:55,072 --> 00:36:57,476
I can finally be at peace.

573
00:36:59,907 --> 00:37:01,465
I love you, too.

574
00:37:01,956 --> 00:37:04,848
And tell Gaby I said thank you.

575
00:37:10,724 --> 00:37:13,030
Are you gonna tell him
the truth about Ana?

576
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,447
They'll find out soon enough.

577
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,855
<i>Hi. I'm trying
to reach Roberta Simmonds.</i>

578
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:31,043
Speaking, but barely.
Who's this?

579
00:37:31,213 --> 00:37:32,687
<i>This is Claire Cormier,</i>

580
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,998
Dr. Heller's receptionist.

581
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,912
- Do you remember me?
- Yeah, sure

582
00:37:38,082 --> 00:37:41,696
but I'm in the middle of my breakfast,
so if you'd call me back around 11:00...

583
00:37:41,866 --> 00:37:45,055
<i>I just thought you might wanna know
the police stopped by.</i>

584
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,025
They told me
that Dr. Heller is dead.

585
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:52,122
Go on. I'm listening.

586
00:37:54,368 --> 00:37:57,528
Dr. Heller died in a fire
at the White Horse?

587
00:37:57,698 --> 00:38:01,398
And apparently, there was no smoke
in his lungs. Which means he was dead

588
00:38:01,568 --> 00:38:03,027
before the fire started.

589
00:38:03,821 --> 00:38:06,936
My guess? The person he was coming
to see is the person who killed him.

590
00:38:14,183 --> 00:38:16,349
- What are we gonna do?
- Go to the police.

591
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:17,961
And tell 'em what?

592
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:20,745
We know Dr. Heller
was a criminal psychologist,

593
00:38:20,915 --> 00:38:23,291
and we're pretty sure
Dave was his patient.

594
00:38:23,461 --> 00:38:25,515
I'd feel better if we had proof.

595
00:38:25,685 --> 00:38:27,883
I'd feel better if I had
a functioning liver,

596
00:38:28,053 --> 00:38:30,351
but sometimes you have to play
the hand you're dealt.

597
00:38:30,521 --> 00:38:32,718
If we walk into the police
with a half-cocked story,

598
00:38:32,888 --> 00:38:35,348
they're gonna laugh
us out of the station.

599
00:38:35,904 --> 00:38:38,932
I don't know how,
but we gotta give 'em something more.

600
00:38:40,206 --> 00:38:43,352
Didn't you tell me Dave
once broke into your house?

601
00:38:44,869 --> 00:38:46,011
Why?

602
00:38:46,788 --> 00:38:49,840
Maybe it's time
we returned the favor.

603
00:38:52,018 --> 00:38:54,558
When you missed
your appointment on Monday,

604
00:38:55,138 --> 00:38:58,021
we thought maybe
you skipped out on us.

605
00:38:59,903 --> 00:39:02,257
As you can see,
I was otherwise detained.

606
00:39:03,937 --> 00:39:05,148
You know this guy?

607
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:12,555
- Who is he?
- Samuel Heller

608
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:15,132
the John Doe
who died in the club fire.

609
00:39:15,647 --> 00:39:18,013
You sure you didn't see him when
you were in that back hallway?

610
00:39:19,894 --> 00:39:22,636
Like I told you that night,
I was only back there for a minute.

611
00:39:23,216 --> 00:39:24,944
And you didn't see anybody?

612
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,884
It was a long time ago.

613
00:39:29,923 --> 00:39:32,705
I was looking for the men's room.
I ran into Dave Williams.

614
00:39:32,875 --> 00:39:35,728
- He was coming out of the storage room--
- Wait.

615
00:39:36,013 --> 00:39:38,257
You saw Dave Williams
coming out of the storage room?

616
00:39:40,716 --> 00:39:42,726
Didn't I tell you that before?

617
00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:47,505
I thought it was the bathroom, but
Dave pointed me in the right direction.

618
00:39:49,446 --> 00:39:52,352
And right after that,
somebody locked you in.

619
00:39:54,487 --> 00:39:56,346
Come on. You don't think
Dave did that.

620
00:39:56,954 --> 00:39:58,137
I don't know.

621
00:39:58,651 --> 00:40:00,407
He have any reason to harm you?

622
00:40:03,131 --> 00:40:04,371
We're friends.

623
00:40:05,401 --> 00:40:07,360
He's one of the nicest guys
I've ever met.

624
00:40:10,899 --> 00:40:12,721
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Braddock.

625
00:40:14,684 --> 00:40:16,788
I'm sorry I couldn't be more help.

626
00:40:19,701 --> 00:40:21,959
How many times we talk
to this Williams guy?

627
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:24,191
I don't know. Four?

628
00:40:25,438 --> 00:40:28,584
He ever mention anything about
being in that storage room?

629
00:40:29,243 --> 00:40:30,849
He did not.

630
00:40:48,535 --> 00:40:52,299
- I'm gonna catch a fish this big.
- If you do, we're gonna clean it

631
00:40:52,469 --> 00:40:56,235
- and serve it up for dinner.
- And if I don't, can we eat the worms?

632
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,947
Just make sure he catches a fish.

633
00:41:01,871 --> 00:41:04,938
I got something for you.
It's a video from our band,

634
00:41:05,108 --> 00:41:06,605
one of our early rehearsals.

635
00:41:06,775 --> 00:41:09,852
- Do I even want to see this?
- Yeah. We weren't half bad.

636
00:41:10,245 --> 00:41:12,301
Don't watch it till you get back
from your honeymoon.

637
00:41:13,774 --> 00:41:15,323
Will do. Thanks.

638
00:41:19,452 --> 00:41:20,878
Bye, Mike.

639
00:41:22,091 --> 00:41:24,477
- Have a nice wedding.
- Thanks.

640
00:41:38,145 --> 00:41:40,032
You take good care of my boy, okay?

641
00:41:41,593 --> 00:41:42,814
You can count on me.
