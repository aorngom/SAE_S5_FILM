12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,968
<i>it happens in every marriage.</i>

13
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:45,267
<i>couples accumulate
lovely things-</i>

14
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,901
<i>things that make a house
a home.</i>

15
00:00:49,934 --> 00:00:54,534
<i>but when the home is broken,
these things must be divided.</i>

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,200
<i>the most dignified way
to do this</i>

17
00:00:57,233 --> 00:00:58,701
<i>is for each spouse</i>

18
00:00:58,734 --> 00:01:02,534
<i>to keep what is
most important to them.</i>

19
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:06,434
<i>and bree and orson hodge
were nothing...</i>

20
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:08,767
<i>if not dignified</i>

21
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:11,300
i assume you'll want
the pewter cat.

22
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,175
that was my gift to you.

23
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:15,267
you adored it, as i recall.

24
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,667
that's why i'm giving you
the choice.

25
00:01:21,863 --> 00:01:23,999
and what about that hummel
from your aunt?

26
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:24,701
it's ugly as sin,

27
00:01:24,734 --> 00:01:26,999
but she insists
that it's valuable.

28
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:29,534
you keep it.
keep everything.

29
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:32,034
there's only one thing
in this house that i want.

30
00:01:32,068 --> 00:01:34,400
i know, but i'm the one thing
you can't have.

31
00:01:34,434 --> 00:01:36,601
please,
you have to forgive me.

32
00:01:36,634 --> 00:01:38,601
orson,
every wife understands

33
00:01:38,634 --> 00:01:41,034
that her husband
will make a few mistakes-

34
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:44,316
a forgotten anniversary,
the occasional harsh word,

35
00:01:44,316 --> 00:01:45,999
but we all have to
draw the line somewhere,

36
00:01:45,999 --> 00:01:47,440
and i'm drawing mine
at the attempted murder

37
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,550
of my best friend's husband.

38
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,737
bree, if i could open up
my heart

39
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:55,143
and show you how sorry i am,
i would, but i can't.

40
00:01:55,143 --> 00:01:57,160
there must be something else
i could do.

41
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,334
there is one thing.

42
00:02:04,367 --> 00:02:06,400
name it.

43
00:02:06,434 --> 00:02:08,434
turn yourself in
to the police.

44
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:12,050
but the statute of limitations
hasn't run out.

45
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,200
they would arrest me.

46
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:16,300
and you'd probably go to prison.
yes, i could go away for years.

47
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,175
exactly, and if you could muster
that kind of moral courage,

48
00:02:19,175 --> 00:02:21,300
i think
i could forgive you.

49
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:25,300
oh, come on.

50
00:02:25,334 --> 00:02:28,001
i promise
i'll wait for you.

51
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:31,901
bree...

52
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:34,534
i can't go to prison.

53
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:39,601
very well.

54
00:02:43,267 --> 00:02:45,734
so do you want the cat
or not?

55
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:48,867
<i>in any separation,
it's only fair</i>

56
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:53,167
<i>that each spouse get to keep
what is most important to them.</i>

57
00:02:55,701 --> 00:03:00,834
<i>that's how bree hodge
got to keep her pewter cat...</i>

58
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:05,253
<i>and orson hodge got
to hold on to...</i>

59
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,400
<i>his freedom.</i>

<i>you know the type-</i>

<i>the man who opens his door

<i>means letting them

70
00:03:42,987 --> 00:03:45,800
hi. i'm ellie. i understand
you got a room to rent.

71
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,737
yeah, come on in.

72
00:03:47,737 --> 00:03:49,425
so because of
my husband's disability,

73
00:03:49,425 --> 00:03:52,112
our financial situation
has changed,

74
00:03:52,112 --> 00:03:53,379
and we have this big house.

75
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:55,488
well, it's an amazing place,
and i love the room.

76
00:03:55,488 --> 00:03:57,394
i can't believe
it's still available.

77
00:03:57,394 --> 00:04:03,067
well, you know... anyhow, uh,
you have a great credit score.

78
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,267
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
what was that?

79
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,738
what was what?

80
00:04:06,738 --> 00:04:09,488
ellie, did she just give me
a dirty look?

81
00:04:09,488 --> 00:04:11,175
uh...

82
00:04:11,691 --> 00:04:14,487
yeah, i thought so.

83
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,366
i'm sorry, ellie.

84
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,200
there's been some tension
between my husband and me.

85
00:04:19,234 --> 00:04:21,300
see, the truth is, we could've
had the room rented by now

86
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,675
<i>if my husband
wasn't so paranoid.</i>

87
00:04:23,675 --> 00:04:27,987
why, because i wouldn't let the swedish
bodybuilder move in? you're as blind as a fruit bat.

88
00:04:27,987 --> 00:04:29,488
how would you know
if he's a bodybuilder?

89
00:04:29,488 --> 00:04:33,488
i brushed up against him.
i felt his bicep. it was huge.

90
00:04:33,488 --> 00:04:35,175
that wasn't his bicep.

91
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:38,112
why do you think
he rushed out of here?

92
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:41,878
okay, i normally dig this sort
of interpersonal stuff,

93
00:04:41,878 --> 00:04:46,050
but i have a class in 20,
so back to me?

94
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,067
you're right, ellie.

95
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,300
my husband was
totally inappropriate.

96
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,988
so a class? are you a teacher?
actually, i'm an art student.

97
00:04:52,988 --> 00:04:55,988
my life was working pretty well,
and so i decided to junk it

98
00:04:55,988 --> 00:05:00,316
and learn how to paint fruit.
it's, uh, stupid, right?

99
00:05:00,316 --> 00:05:02,833
no, it's gutsy.

100
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:05,466
well, we like you,
ellie,

101
00:05:05,499 --> 00:05:07,504
and if you have
first and last months' rent,

102
00:05:07,504 --> 00:05:09,175
we'd like you even more.
fantastic.

103
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:13,050
i just hit the bank,
so do you mind cash?

104
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:17,334
<i>oh, no, i love cash.
cash and i go way back.</i>

105
00:05:18,863 --> 00:05:20,050
so are you okay with this,

106
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,267
or do you need
to grope her, too?

107
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,033
so that really wasn't
the guy's arm?

108
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:27,067
it had an elbow.

109
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,733
<i>is this the clean pile?</i>

110
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,050
'cause i'm not seeing it!

111
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,988
you know what?
do 'em all again.

112
00:05:35,988 --> 00:05:38,612
this time,
use a little elbow grease.

113
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:42,000
how are they doing?

114
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:44,363
they are not suffering
enough for my taste.

115
00:05:44,363 --> 00:05:47,550
are you sure that washing dishes
is the right punishment?

116
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,050
well, gee, i'm kind of
at a loss here, tom.

117
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,738
dr. spock didn't have a chapter
on how to punish your kids

118
00:05:51,738 --> 00:05:56,300
for burning down a building. i just
don't feel like we're handling this right.

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,466
maybe we should take 'em
to therapy.

120
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,238
tom, they're not
serial killers.

121
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:03,675
they're two little boys

122
00:06:03,675 --> 00:06:05,581
who were afraid their parents
were breaking up.

123
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:06,253
but still-

124
00:06:06,253 --> 00:06:09,050
no. we can handle this
in-house.

125
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,999
we can make sure they never
do anything like this again.

126
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:15,816
fine.
we'll try it your way.

127
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:17,613
but this next month

128
00:06:17,613 --> 00:06:20,143
is gonna be like boot camp
for these guys.

129
00:06:20,143 --> 00:06:22,425
they are going to
be cleaning out the gutters,

130
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:24,941
taking out the trash,
mowing the lawns.

131
00:06:24,941 --> 00:06:26,175
wait a second.
th
ose are your chores.

132
00:06:26,175 --> 00:06:28,191
no time to talk.
dinner shift's starting.

133
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,833
okay, this is the place.

134
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:36,237
oh, here, let me throw that
away for you.

135
00:06:36,237 --> 00:06:37,999
no, i'm not finished
with it.

136
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,999
it's a lamaze class.

137
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,050
i guarantee you i will not
be the only woman in there

138
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,628
holding a chimichanga.

139
00:06:45,328 --> 00:06:47,800
wow. it's all couples.

140
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,441
i wish mike didn't have
that rehab thing tonight.

141
00:06:50,441 --> 00:06:52,832
do you want me to stay?
i can skip the movie.

142
00:06:52,832 --> 00:06:55,691
oh, no,
that's okay. i'll be fine.

143
00:06:55,691 --> 00:06:57,738
okay. have fun.

144
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:13,700
quit eyeing it.
i ain't sharing.

145
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,133
okay, don't talk.
just listen.

146
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:19,612
remember last year
when i brought up

147
00:07:19,612 --> 00:07:20,863
dad's new girlfriend,
and you said you never wanted

148
00:07:20,863 --> 00:07:24,144
to hear another word about
one of his skanks again? yeah.

149
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,550
okay, well, i just spotted them
in the hallway,

150
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,050
and there's something
you should know.

151
00:07:31,766 --> 00:07:34,612
oh... my god.

152
00:07:34,612 --> 00:07:37,816
okay, you're all caught up. he got his
skank pregnant, and you didn't tell me?

153
00:07:37,816 --> 00:07:40,238
i tried, remember? i said,
"dad and marisa are about to-"

154
00:07:40,238 --> 00:07:41,425
and then you stopped me,
and then you said,

155
00:07:41,425 --> 00:07:43,675
"talk to the hand," and i said, "no one says that anymore"
- okay, i get it.

156
00:07:43,675 --> 00:07:46,550
one more thing.
they're married. see ya.

157
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,112
susie q.! what a small world!

158
00:07:51,112 --> 00:07:54,033
look how fat you are.

159
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:55,644
hello, karl.

160
00:07:55,644 --> 00:07:59,378
marisa, this is susan,
my ex-wife.

161
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:03,737
hello. it's so nice
to finally meet... you.

162
00:08:03,737 --> 00:08:06,737
honey, i-i'm gonna go sign us in
and get us a couple mats.

163
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,237
okay.

164
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:11,394
can you believe this?

165
00:08:11,394 --> 00:08:14,300
what are the chances we'd end up
having more kids, huh?

166
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,237
<i>especially you.
what does that mean?</i>

167
00:08:17,237 --> 00:08:19,754
i'm just saying,
most eggs your age don't take.

168
00:08:19,754 --> 00:08:21,160
<i>power to you.</i>

169
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,191
okay, clearly,
this is not going to work.

170
00:08:23,191 --> 00:08:25,113
so why don't you
take your child bride

171
00:08:25,113 --> 00:08:26,284
and find another class?

172
00:08:26,284 --> 00:08:30,175
i know. she's young. makes you
wanna have work done, huh?

173
00:08:30,175 --> 00:08:34,394
<i>or should i say, more work
done? the only work i've had done</i>

174
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:37,816
was getting 185 pounds of
ugly fat sucked out of my house.

175
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:39,363
you're jealous. i get it.

176
00:08:39,363 --> 00:08:43,457
she's gorgeous, funny,
a law professor.

177
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:46,862
oh, no, no, no, th-those are not
the legs of a law professor.

178
00:08:46,862 --> 00:08:48,129
not that she needs to work.

179
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:50,238
i just made partner
at my firm. thanks.

180
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:53,175
i keep telling her,
"slow down.

181
00:08:53,175 --> 00:08:54,238
"if you need something to do,

182
00:08:54,238 --> 00:08:57,379
why not oversee the remodel
of our new ski chalet?"

183
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,237
well, i better get back
to marisa.

184
00:09:02,128 --> 00:09:04,175
and by the way,
you're dripping.

185
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,690
bye, mom. i'm leaving.

186
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,393
be home by 10:00.

187
00:09:15,393 --> 00:09:16,925
10:00?
but it's almost 8:00 now.

188
00:09:16,925 --> 00:09:19,207
yes, and it's also
a school night.

189
00:09:20,878 --> 00:09:23,133
fine.
introduce me to this boy,

190
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,487
and we'll talk about
making your curfew later.

191
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,862
yeah,
maybe some other night.

192
00:09:27,862 --> 00:09:30,362
sweetie, i'm gonna have to
meet him eventually.

193
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:33,675
it's just... i don't even know
if i like him yet.

194
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,362
when i do, you can meet him.

195
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:38,972
i'll be home by 10:00.

196
00:09:44,188 --> 00:09:44,893
hey, dad.

197
00:09:44,893 --> 00:09:45,816
hey, princess.

198
00:09:45,816 --> 00:09:47,300
let's go. i'm starving.

199
00:09:51,488 --> 00:09:54,097
honey, i can't find
my nail file. have you seen it?

200
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,550
is that some kind
of joke?

201
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,378
oh, right. i keep forgetting
you're useless.

202
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,800
i'm gonna see
if ellie has one.

203
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,300
hey, ellie,
you got a sec?

204
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,753
be right there.

205
00:10:11,453 --> 00:10:12,925
hey, what's up?

206
00:10:12,925 --> 00:10:15,300
hey, um...
oh, i'm sorry.

207
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,675
i didn't know
you were... entertaining.

208
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,800
hi. i'm gaby solis.

209
00:10:22,363 --> 00:10:23,487
hey.

210
00:10:23,487 --> 00:10:26,175
um, so what do you need?

211
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,362
oh, you know what?
it can wait.

212
00:10:27,362 --> 00:10:28,628
i'll see you
in the morning.

213
00:10:35,313 --> 00:10:37,425
okay, that was weird.

214
00:10:37,425 --> 00:10:38,987
what?

215
00:10:39,467 --> 00:10:42,893
earlier tonight, i saw a guy
coming out of ellie's room,

216
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:43,999
so i assumed
it was her boyfriend,

217
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:46,909
but just now i caught her
in there with another guy.

218
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:50,999
okay. so we have two tramps
living in our house.

219
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:53,238
that was for the "useless"
comment, wasn't it?

220
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:57,190
mm-hmm.
and it felt good.

221
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:02,367
oh, it sounds like
he's leaving.

222
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,367
i hope
it's not 'cause of me.

223
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,367
mm.

224
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,899
maybe i should go
apologize.

225
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:24,966
okay, there may be
two tramps in this house,

226
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,499
but only one of 'em
is getting paid.

227
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:32,487
hey, lynette.

228
00:11:32,487 --> 00:11:34,956
ida's cat got out again.
you haven't seen him, have ya?

229
00:11:34,956 --> 00:11:36,738
no, sorry.
i hope you find him.

230
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,613
well, if he's anything like ida,
he'll wander into my house drunk

231
00:11:39,613 --> 00:11:41,706
the next time
"guiding light" is on.

232
00:11:44,632 --> 00:11:46,253
wait. hold on.
i have to fix this.

233
00:11:49,488 --> 00:11:52,050
this is so unfair.

234
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,253
yeah, i know. i hate her.

235
00:11:54,253 --> 00:11:56,503
<i>how come she's not
in trouble?</i>

236
00:11:56,503 --> 00:11:58,113
<i>because we started the fire,
you idiot,</i>

237
00:11:58,113 --> 00:12:00,238
<i>so now we have
to be punished.</i>

238
00:12:00,238 --> 00:12:04,878
i know, but it was her idea! boys?

239
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:08,699
who are you talking about?

240
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,331
kayla?

241
00:12:15,331 --> 00:12:17,613
can i speak to you
for a second?

242
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:19,238
i guess.

243
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:21,112
i need to ask you something,

244
00:12:21,112 --> 00:12:24,393
and i want you
to tell me the truth, okay?

245
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,675
did you have anything to do

246
00:12:27,675 --> 00:12:29,769
with the fire
at rick's restaurant?

247
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:32,440
did someone say i did?

248
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,425
i'm looking for
a "yes" or "no" answer here.

249
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,862
i didn't start the fire.

250
00:12:38,862 --> 00:12:43,566
no, the twins did,
but they say it was your idea.

251
00:12:44,237 --> 00:12:45,266
it was a joke.

252
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,300
<i>i didn't think
they'd actually do it.</i>

253
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,816
kayla...

254
00:12:49,175 --> 00:12:52,112
why would you even joke
about something like that?

255
00:12:53,632 --> 00:12:55,253
we heard
you and daddy talking

256
00:12:55,253 --> 00:12:57,488
about how rick wanted
to take you away.

257
00:12:57,488 --> 00:13:00,675
porter was so mad.
he wanted to blow rick up.

258
00:13:00,675 --> 00:13:02,987
preston told him
he could use dynamite.

259
00:13:02,987 --> 00:13:04,706
i told them
that was stupid.

260
00:13:04,706 --> 00:13:06,237
no one has dynamite
in their house.

261
00:13:08,909 --> 00:13:11,050
but everyone has matches.

262
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,112
do you have any idea
what you've done?

263
00:13:14,112 --> 00:13:15,816
someone
could have been killed.

264
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:16,800
but they weren't.

265
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,925
but it doesn'tmatter!

266
00:13:18,925 --> 00:13:23,800
intentionally setting a fire
is a very serious crime.

267
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,863
<i>don't you get that?</i>

268
00:13:25,863 --> 00:13:27,254
i do.

269
00:13:27,254 --> 00:13:30,675
that's why i think it's good
you're punishing the twins.

270
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:32,833
they're really bad kids,

271
00:13:33,238 --> 00:13:35,699
and they need to learn.

272
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,503
i told you
we'd be overdressed.

273
00:13:49,503 --> 00:13:50,738
there's nothing wrong
with that.

274
00:13:50,738 --> 00:13:52,550
it shows our respect
for lamaze,

275
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,050
and, you know,
the whole birthing process.

276
00:13:57,934 --> 00:14:00,567
<i>or it's that
your ex-husband's here.</i>

277
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,268
karl? is he here?
oh, what a freakish-

278
00:14:04,268 --> 00:14:07,238
don't even bother.
why didn't you just tell me?

279
00:14:07,238 --> 00:14:08,925
'cause i knew you'd make us
switch to another class.

280
00:14:08,925 --> 00:14:09,847
last time i was here,

281
00:14:09,847 --> 00:14:12,175
karl kept throwing
his perfect life in my face,

282
00:14:12,175 --> 00:14:13,394
and i just wanted
to come back here

283
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:17,362
and show him that we were doing
well, too. hence the sport coat.

284
00:14:17,362 --> 00:14:18,769
"hence." that's classy.

285
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:21,363
say a lot of "hence"
when we see him.

286
00:14:21,363 --> 00:14:22,941
susan, i'm not gonna lie
about who i am.

287
00:14:22,941 --> 00:14:25,425
i'm not asking you to lie.
i'm just saying spin.

288
00:14:25,425 --> 00:14:28,050
why won't you spin?
i don't know.

289
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:31,457
hey, plumber!
somebody clog a toilet?

290
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,862
i'm in.

291
00:14:35,563 --> 00:14:36,800
hey, guys.

292
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,487
mike, you remember karl?

293
00:14:38,487 --> 00:14:42,175
and this is karl's wife marisa. hello.

294
00:14:42,984 --> 00:14:44,237
so how's things going?

295
00:14:44,237 --> 00:14:45,550
you still spending
most of your time

296
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,612
with your head
under a sink?

297
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,362
actually, i hired
a couple of guys,

298
00:14:50,362 --> 00:14:51,191
and they do all the work.

299
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:53,472
i just sit back
and cash the checks,

300
00:14:53,472 --> 00:14:54,800
hence the sport coat.

301
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,425
yeah, you guys look fantastic.
i feel like such a slob.

302
00:14:58,425 --> 00:14:59,987
kind of overdressed,
aren't you?

303
00:14:59,987 --> 00:15:02,159
well, after this,
we have a big party to go to.

304
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:05,238
yeah, our social life
is just crazy these days.

305
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:09,675
seems like every night we have
some fancy party. just bananas.

306
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,487
<i>why don't you ever
take me out?</i>

307
00:15:11,487 --> 00:15:12,738
hey, at least
i didn't ditch you

308
00:15:12,738 --> 00:15:14,988
on the first day
of lamaze class.

309
00:15:14,988 --> 00:15:18,112
i didn't ditch susan.
i was getting my 30-day chip.

310
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,550
what, you're like an alkie?

311
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:25,800
drugs, actually.
prescription drugs.

312
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,113
but i went through rehab,

313
00:15:27,113 --> 00:15:28,785
and i'm clean now.

314
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,988
wow. congratulations.

315
00:15:31,988 --> 00:15:35,441
okay, people, time to
get started. take your seats.

316
00:15:38,034 --> 00:15:39,800
so your hubby's been in rehab?

317
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,863
that's just bananas.

318
00:15:46,067 --> 00:15:47,967
wow.

319
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,925
i know.

320
00:15:48,925 --> 00:15:51,862
turns out the whole thing
was kayla's idea.

321
00:15:52,237 --> 00:15:53,175
well, i guess
porter and preston have

322
00:15:53,175 --> 00:15:55,925
a new dishwashing buddy,
huh?

323
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,675
mm, no.

324
00:15:57,675 --> 00:16:00,300
i think it goes
a little further than that.

325
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,175
i think we have

326
00:16:01,175 --> 00:16:04,738
a seriously troubled
young girl.

327
00:16:04,738 --> 00:16:07,988
she needs...
professional help.

328
00:16:09,366 --> 00:16:10,667
like therapy?

329
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,238
you brought it up before,
and in this case,

330
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:13,878
i really don't think
we have a choice.

331
00:16:13,878 --> 00:16:16,612
interesting.
so the boys, who actually

332
00:16:16,612 --> 00:16:19,362
<i>physically set the fire-
they don't need therapy,</i>

333
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:21,425
but kayla, who only
talked about it-she does?

334
00:16:21,425 --> 00:16:23,800
you didn't see her.
she just sat there,

335
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,633
playing with her doll
with this kind of eerie calm.

336
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:31,315
oh, she was calm. yeah,
better nip that in the bud.

337
00:16:31,315 --> 00:16:32,660
no, you're missing my point.

338
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,800
no, i get your point.

339
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,675
there are different rules
for my kid

340
00:16:35,675 --> 00:16:37,503
than there are for yours.

341
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,737
well... yeah.

342
00:16:41,737 --> 00:16:44,440
think of what that poor girl
has been through.

343
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,487
and on top of that...

344
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,238
her mom
was kind of a psycho.

345
00:16:51,425 --> 00:16:55,316
okay, you are saying
that kayla is a psycho now.

346
00:16:55,316 --> 00:16:59,863
i am just saying,
apple... tree.

347
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,940
maybe not so far.

348
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,128
and i'm just saying,
my daughter is fine.

349
00:17:05,128 --> 00:17:06,425
no therapy.

350
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,130
Orson, What Are
You Doing Here?

351
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:25,720
Bree,It's So Good To See You.
I Have Been Doing Some Thinking.

352
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,330
Yes,I Can Smell The
Thinking On Your Breath.

353
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,220
Are You Insane, Driving
In This Condition?

354
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,850
No,I Didn't. I Arrived Sober,
And I Drank While I Waited.

355
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,430
I Am A Law-Abiding Man.

356
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,520
Except For The
Occasional Hit-And-Run.

357
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:40,660
Ah,The Incident. That's
What I'm Here To Talk About.

358
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,120
I Am Prepared To
Meet Your Condition

359
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,730
And Go To The Police.

360
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,880
You Are?

361
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,910
Yes, I Have It
All Figured Out.

362
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,770
The Key Is The
Sleepwalking. Susan Saw It.

363
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,740
We'll Find A
Psychiatrist To Testify

364
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:58,050
That I Was Sleepwalking
When I Drove The Car.

365
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,070
It's Brilliant! No,It's
A Pathetic Fantasy

366
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,810
Fueled By Cowardice
And Amaretto Sours.

367
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,870
You Committed A
Crime,Orson. Face It.

368
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,300
Bree,I Just Want To
Come Home. Please!

369
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,710
Hey! I'm Glad You Two
Are Patching Things Up,

370
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,110
But Take The
Makeup Sex Inside.

371
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,300
Edie,Would You Do Me A Favor

372
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,940
And Take Orson Back
To His Apartment?

373
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:25,840
I Have To Let My Sitter Go
Home. Uh,All Right. Hop In.

374
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:29,080
Oh,No,Please. Don't
Make Me Go Back There.

375
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,780
The Other Divorced Men Are
Trying To Start A Book Club.

376
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,730
Oh,For God Sakes.

377
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,460
You Can Sleep It Off
On My Couch Tonight.

378
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,680
Now Hitch Up Your
Skirt And Get In.

379
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,810
Yeah. Yeah.

380
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,290
There Have Been Men
Coming Out Of Her Room

381
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,340
At All Hours Of The Night,

382
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,920
And I Saw Her
Counting A Wad Of Cash.

383
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,630
So Long Story Short,

384
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:54,010
I Need Your Help To Get
That Hooker Out Of My House.

385
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,400
<I>What Do You Want Us To Do?</I>

386
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,380
Well, I've Got
No Solid Evidence,

387
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,720
And She's Got A Lease.

388
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:04,420
So,Bob,I Was Hoping You
Could "Solicit" Her Services.

389
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,710
That Way I'll Have Proof.

390
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,960
You Do Know I'm Gay,Right?

391
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,230
Exactly. You People Are
Theatrical,And I Need

392
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,730
Someone I Can Count On To
Give A Decent Performance.

393
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,830
I Don't Know. I'll Do It.

394
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:21,550
What?

395
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,080
Well,No Offense.

396
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,270
I Just Think Bob Has A
Better Shot At Pulling It Off.

397
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,590
He's A Little More...

398
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,510
Butch. I Know.

399
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,280
You Hear That,Honey?

400
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,170
Please,The Only Way You'd Be
Convincing As A Straight Guy

401
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,210
Is If You Died And Came
Back As A Straight Guy.

402
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,400
<I>I'm Sorry. Who Went To Their
Senior Prom With A Girl?</I>

403
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,600
Yeah, Suzy Sellers,Gay Maker.

404
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,830
If You're Looking For
Butch, You Should Know

405
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,100
That I Played Tony
In "West Side Story"

406
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,510
To Rave Reviews.

407
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,220
He Also Made Out
With Officer Krupke

408
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,400
During Intermission.

409
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,220
Well,I Really Don't
Care Who Does It.

410
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,820
Just Get It Done.

411
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,870
And... Don't Wear That.

412
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,500
Ugh. Never Watch
A C-Section Film

413
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,540
If You Had A
Calzone For Lunch.

414
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,370
Everything Okay?

415
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,530
Did You Have To Tell
Karl About Rehab?

416
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:24,380
You Said I Didn't Have To
Lie. Yeah,But That Doesn't Mean

417
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,270
You Have To Go Blurting All
Our Deepest,Darkest Secrets.

418
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,240
It's Not Dark. It's
Part Of Who I Am.

419
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,390
Plus One Of The First Things
They Teach You In The Program Is

420
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,560
It's Not Healthy To Keep
Secrets. Hence,The Honesty.

421
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,870
Oh,Enough With The "Hence."

422
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,400
I'm Just Saying That
Some Things Are Private,

423
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,560
And I Think That
You Can Be Honest

424
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,600
Without Being Inappropriate.

425
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,320
When I Said It, His
Wife Congratulated Me.

426
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,400
Did You Notice That?

427
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,460
And Karl Made His
Happy Monkey Face.

428
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,250
Did You Notice That?

429
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,980
You Know What,Susan?

430
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,900
This Reminds Me Of The
Battle I Have To Fight

431
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,130
Every Day For The
Rest Of My Life.

432
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,890
That's What's Important To Me.

433
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,060
I Don't Give A Rat's Ass
What Your Ex-Husband Thinks.

434
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,390
This Isn't Dr. Kagen's Office.

435
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,580
Well,Actually,This Is A
Different Kind Of Doctor.

436
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,980
You Know, The Kind
You Can Talk To?

437
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:19,600
You Brought Me To A Shrink?
Well,I Thought You Might Like

438
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:22,410
To Have A Safe Place Where
You Could Share Your Feelings.

439
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,010
You Know?

440
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,300
With Your Mom's Death
And Moving In With Us,

441
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,600
You've Been Through A Lot.

442
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,800
That Was A Long
Time Ago. I'm Fine.

443
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,850
Well,Good,

444
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,640
But Sometimes When You
Go Through Hard Things,

445
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,430
It Changes The Way You Think.

446
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,230
Maybe We Have Trouble
Telling The Difference

447
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,450
Between What's Right
And What's Wrong.

448
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,170
I Don't Have Any
Trouble With That.

449
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,190
Actually,You Do.
That's Why You're Here.

450
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:53,030
So Let's Just Wait And
Talk To The Doctor,Okay?

451
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:03,760
You Know What,Lynette? Hmm?

452
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,050
<I>Maybe I Should
Talk To The Doctor</I>

453
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,740
About Right And Wrong.

454
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:08,520
Good.

455
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,700
Then Maybe I Should
Talk To The Police.

456
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:15,270
What? No. Sweetie, We
Don't Need To Do That.

457
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,870
Really? 'Cause What The
Twins Did Is A Crime.

458
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,670
I Mean,Like You Said,
Someone Could've Been Killed.

459
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,460
<I>So If We Don't Go To The
Police, Wouldn't That Be Wrong?</I>

460
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,050
You Don't Understand.

461
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,350
No,I Do.

462
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,170
<I>If I Have To Talk To The Shrink,
I Have To Talk To The Cops.</I>

463
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,800
Hi. You Must Be Kayla.
I'm All Ready For You.

464
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,550
Actually, I Think We're Okay.

465
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:45,100
We... Resolved Our Problems

466
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:47,050
Just Sitting In
Your Waiting Room.

467
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,350
Boy,You're Good.

468
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,330
Ahem. 'Kay. So We're Gonna Go.

469
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,120
Target In Place. We're A Go.

470
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,560
He's Coming Out.

471
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,920
What Is He Wearing?

472
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,570
He Looks Like The
Lost Member Of Wham!

473
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,680
He Thinks The Outfit
Makes Him Look Straight.

474
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,320
Just Be Thankful I Got The
Toothpick Out Of His Mouth.

475
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,870
<I>Must He Put His Hand
On His Hip Like That?</I>

476
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,790
Butch Up,For God Sakes!

477
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,620
What?! What Do You Think I Am?

478
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,890
Uh-Oh.

479
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,940
What?! Ohh!

480
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,520
Oh,Crap! Abort! Abort!

481
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,540
I'm Sorry. I'm Sorry. You Are A
Pig,And I'm Gonna Kick Your Ass.

482
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,740
Ohh! Ellie,What Are You Doing?

483
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,170
Your Creepy Neighbor
- He Came Over Here

484
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,480
And Offered Me Money To
Sleep With Him. Gaby,Tell Her.

485
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,040
Tell Me What?

486
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,820
Uh,He Did The
Same Thing To Me.

487
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,020
Perv! Ohh!

488
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,510
Hey,That's Enough.
Gaby,Tell Her,Or I Will.

489
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:00,800
What's Going On?

490
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,850
Here's The Thing.

491
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,710
I Thought You Were A Hooker.

492
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,000
So I Had Lee Proposition You
So I Could Catch You In The Act.

493
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,150
But Guess What? You
Passed The Test. Yay!

494
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,370
Everybody Inside
For Margaritas.

495
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,240
Ellie,Wait. I Made A Mistake.

496
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,330
Can We Please Talk About This?

497
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,980
Dude,You Just Told Your
Neighbors That I'm A Whore.

498
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,770
Look At It From
My Point Of View.

499
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:34,820
You're An Attractive Woman.
Guys Are Coming And Going.

500
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,870
I Saw You Take Money
From One Of 'Em.

501
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,880
What Am I Supposed To Think?

502
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:45,400
All Right. You
Might As Well Know.

503
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,470
I Do Tattoos.

504
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,230
You Do What?

505
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,810
See, I've Been
Working Downtown,

506
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,060
And I Have This Jerk Of A
Boss Who Takes 70% Of My Money.

507
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,650
So I'm Trying To
Earn Enough Cash

508
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,980
To Finally Open My Own Shop.

509
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,550
You've Been Running A Tattoo
Parlor Out Of My House?

510
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,970
I Know. I'm Sorry I Lied.

511
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,730
I'll Be Gone In The Morning.

512
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,080
Okay,Ellie,Wait.

513
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,680
You Don't Have To
Go. Are You Sure?

514
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:19,130
Because I Have To Keep Doing
My Work To Pay For School.

515
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:22,420
Well,I Suppose I Could Look
The Other Way For A Few Months.

516
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,380
It's The Least I Could Do
For Thinking You're A Whore.

517
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,000
Forgive Me?

518
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,040
Of Course.

519
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:55,280
Oh,Hi.

520
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,330
Hi,Edie. Thanks Again For
Helping Me Out Last Night.

521
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,760
Oh,No Problem.

522
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,550
Orson's Car Is Still
Parked At My House.

523
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,600
Um,Did He Mention When He'd
Be Coming Back To Pick It Up?

524
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,960
Well,Why Don't You Ask Him
Yourself? He's In The Shower.

525
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,210
He Spent The Night Here?

526
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,660
Apparently,He's Not A Big
Fan Of Fairview Towers,

527
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,910
And He Was So Drunk And Whiny,
I Just Let Him Ride My Couch.

528
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,180
Well,Um,Just So You
Know, In The Future,

529
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:24,670
I'm Not Comfortable With
That. This Can't Happen Again.

530
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:26,760
Bree...

531
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,440
What Are You Getting At?

532
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,560
Oh,I-I-I
Think You Know.

533
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,740
Tell Me Anyway,

534
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:35,170
<I>Just In Case You're Not
Saying I'm A Big Slut.</I>

535
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,820
Oh,Come On,Edie.

536
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,580
You Know, Carlos,Mike,Karl-

537
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,340
You Do Have A Way At Picking
At Other Women's Leftovers.

538
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:44,830
<I>First Of All, I Am
Not Attracted To Orson.</I>

539
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,930
I Mean,That Would Be
Like Having Sex With Pbs.

540
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,530
And Second,Just Because I
Don't Like Your Attitude,

541
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,380
I'm Gonna Let Him Stay
As Long As He Wants. Edie!

542
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,410
Days,Weeks-Might Even Let
Him Hang My Christmas Lights.

543
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,950
Come On,Edie. Think
Of Our Friendship.

544
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,700
How'd You Expect Me
To React, Lynette?

545
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,650
You Took Her To
Therapy Behind My Back.

546
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,250
And I Wouldn't Have Done
That Unless I Thought

547
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:12,960
We Had A Serious Problem,Which We
Do. Why,Because She Threatened You?

548
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,550
Of Course She Did. You Ambushed
Her. Tom,It Is One Thing

549
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,880
Not To Want To Admit
Something's Wrong With Your Kid.

550
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:20,030
It's Another To Just Bury
Your Head In The Sand.

551
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:24,720
Who's Burying Their Head In The Sand? You Are.
There Are Opportunities That You Can See That-

552
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,620
No,No,No,No,You're Distorting Reality.
I'm Not! What Would Be My Agenda?

553
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,430
You Can't Pull
The Crap Like This.

554
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,520
Whoa!

555
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,570
What Are You Doing?

556
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,000
I Jumped Off The
Roof. It Was Awesome.

557
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,030
No Way.

558
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:52,550
Yeah. It Was Just Like A
Parachute. You Wanna Try It?

559
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:54,770
But Maybe It Won't Work.

560
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,890
<I>It Will. I Just Did It.</I>

561
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,980
If You Want, I Can Show You.

562
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,910
Oh,Wait. You're In Trouble.

563
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,740
You Can't.

564
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,500
Never Mind.

565
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,510
...Your Head In The Sand. No.
You're Burying Your Head In The Sand.

566
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,100
It Is Different. No,Because You're Distorting Reality.
There Are So Many Opportunities That You Could Look And See

567
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,380
What's Going On. I Am Not! But You
Can't Pull Crap Like This,Lynette.

568
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,000
Either You Treat Kayla Like She's Your Own Kid
- Come On. I Do.

569
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,270
Aah!

570
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,760
Mom!

571
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,030
Ow! Ow,Ow,Ow,Ow!

572
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:35,840
Oh,My God! Oh,My
God! What Happened?

573
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,070
Is He Okay?

574
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:41,390
Porter,Get Down Off
That Roof! Get Up. Up.

575
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,010
Ow! It Hurts. Oh,We Gotta
Take Him To The Hospital.

576
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,090
Okay,You Stay Here. You
Take Care Of The Kids. Okay.

577
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,450
I Will Take Him To The
Hospital. All Right.

578
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,900
No,You-You Both Go. I Got The Kids. Go,
Go,Go,Go. Thanks,Karen. Come Here,Buddy.

579
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,790
There. It's Okay,Sweetie.
You're Gonna Be Just Fine.

580
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,470
There.

581
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,550
Hey,Susie.

582
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,190
Where's The Plumber?

583
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,210
Fishing A Wedding Ring Out Of
Some Housewife's Grease Trap?

584
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,390
He's Not Feeling Well.

585
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,480
I See Marisa
Isn't Here Either.

586
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,370
Yeah,She Got Stuck
At Her Book Signing.

587
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,500
She Writes Books,Like You,

588
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,560
Only Hers Are For
Grown-Ups And They Sell.

589
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:35,830
Okay,Karl,You Win. You Happy?

590
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,150
Whoa. What's This About?

591
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:42,110
Just Drop The Act.
You Are So Loving This.

592
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,490
You Ended Up

593
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:46,030
With The Miss America
With A Law Degree,

594
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,250
And I Ended Up With
The Pillhead Plumber.

595
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,610
Bravo.

596
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,800
Oh! Damn It! Why
Won't This Unroll?

597
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,150
You Know, Marisa's
Not Perfect.

598
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,640
We Have Our Problems
Like Anyone Else.

599
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,130
Oh,Really?

600
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,370
You Guys Live
One Day At A Time?

601
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,450
Is Your First Thought
When She's Late

602
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:10,760
That Maybe She's Out Using
Again Or Maybe She's Dead?

603
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,900
It Just Seems Like Everything
Is So Fragile Right Now,

604
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,410
Which Is Not The
Way You Want It To Be

605
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,180
When You're About
To Have A Baby.

606
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,500
Ugh.

607
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,940
So You're Worried You
Might Be Having A Kid

608
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,560
With An Unreliable Guy.

609
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,370
I Get It. You Did
That Once Before.

610
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:38,690
Uh,Yeah. That
Guy Was The Worst.

611
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,310
Wasn't I,Though?

612
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,710
I Cheated,Drank Too Much.

613
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,430
I Made That Play
For Your Cousin.

614
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,810
Oh,Right, You Didn't
Know About That.

615
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,830
That Never Happened.

616
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:52,820
Anyway, I Lied About
Every Bit Of It.

617
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:55,130
At Least Mike's
Trying To Be Honest.

618
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,790
I Know.

619
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,620
I Just Wish I Could
Fast-Forward Through My Life

620
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:02,050
And See That
Everything Ends Up Okay.

621
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,350
Hey,Don't Tell
The Plumber This,

622
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,880
But,Uh... He's A Good Guy.

623
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,560
I Think He's Gonna
Be There For You

624
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,390
In A Way That I Never Was.

625
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,250
Thank You.

626
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,210
Which Cousin?

627
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,740
Oh,Look, A Model
Of The Uterus.

628
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:27,070
He's A Big,Gray Cat,So If You
Could Just Keep An Eye Out?

629
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,080
Of Course. Actually,
Karen,When I'm Done Here,

630
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:32,270
I Could Go Try To Find Toby For
You. Thanks,Bree. I Appreciate That.

631
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,050
Oh,If You Do Find Him,
Don't Look Him In The Eye.

632
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,610
It Angries Him Up.

633
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,810
That's Very Nice
Of You To Help Her,

634
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,270
And It'll Take Your Mind Off
Of Everything With Orson,Too.

635
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,900
I Hope So. Truth
Is,I Miss Him.

636
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,240
And I'll Probably Let
Him Come Home Eventually.

637
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,490
I Just Need To
Know He Understands

638
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,490
The Gravity Of What He Did.

639
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:57,680
Well,I Don't Know What
He Did, But Be Careful.

640
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,160
Some Men Say They're
Going To Change,

641
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,610
And They Can't.

642
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:06,120
Oh,Hello,Dylan.
You Look Lovely.

643
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,630
She Has A Date With A
Boy I Haven't Met Yet.

644
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,660
It's Just A Movie.
It's No Big Deal.

645
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,990
Be That As It
May, It's The,What,

646
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:17,530
Third Time You've Gone Out?
I Don't Even Know His Name.

647
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,150
Mom,I Told You. I'm Not
Ready For You To Meet Him.

648
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:24,480
When I Am,You'll Know. Good
Night,Mrs. Hodge. Good Night.

649
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,130
Okay,Back To Business.

650
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,700
How Do You Feel About
Parker House Rolls?

651
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,870
I Mean,Personally, I
Think They're Played Out.

652
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,170
Actually,Bree,Can We Pick
This Up Again Tomorrow?

653
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:40,050
Well,Of Course. Is
Everything All Right?

654
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:43,220
Oh,Yes. I Just Need To
Go Spy On My Daughter.

655
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,340
Ah,The Key Is To Keep One Car

656
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,820
Between Yours And Hers
At All Times. Have Fun.

657
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,080
Oh,We Should Probably
Get The Check.

658
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,820
I Have To Be Back By 10:00.

659
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,690
We Still Have Time For Coffee?

660
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:02,850
I Don't Wanna Push It. Mom
Was All Over Me Tonight.

661
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,680
I'm Sorry About That.

662
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:07,860
Whatever. It's Fine.

663
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:13,090
No. It's Not. I Can See How
Hard This Whole Thing Is On You.

664
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,460
It Makes Me Wish
We Could Just...

665
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,370
Tell Her The Truth.

666
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,690
I Don't Know.

667
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,000
Well...

668
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,840
It's Your Choice. And
You're Probably Right.

669
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:29,900
We Got A Good Thing Going
Here. I Don't Wanna Ruin It.

670
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:35,330
But I'll Tell You Something.
If It Was Only Up To Me...

671
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,970
I'd Come Clean.

672
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:40,920
You Would?

673
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,320
Absolutely.

674
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:46,630
That Way I Could Tell
Your Mom How Sorry I Am.

675
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:48,820
I
- I Wouldn't Expect Her To Forgive Me,

676
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,310
But I Could Hope

677
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,140
She Could At Least...

678
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,560
See I've Changed.

679
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:03,510
But Whatever You
Wanna Do Is Okay By Me.

680
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:27,590
Okay,Thank You.

681
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:32,250
Well,I've Got A Room At
A Hotel In Mt. Pleasant.

682
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,250
I Guess I'll Get Going.

683
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:37,940
Oh,It's Late. Why
Not Just Go Tomorrow?

684
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,190
Well, I Feel
Like I'm Imposing.

685
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,140
You Are.

686
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,430
But You Make A Decent Martini,

687
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:46,360
So What The Hell.

688
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,110
So...

689
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:51,080
You Like The
Hodge Formula,Huh?

690
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,170
You See,The Secret-

691
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,150
I Don't Hear Shaking.

692
00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:00,540
By The Way,Did You See Bree
When You Were Coming Home?

693
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:01,580
Oh.

694
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:05,200
No,I Didn't.

695
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,070
I Keep Thinking
She's Gonna Call Me.

696
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,840
Look,You Don't Have To Talk
About It If You Don't Want To,

697
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,210
But... What The Heck Happened

698
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,250
Over At Ken And
Barbie's Dream House?

699
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:17,100
I Made A Mistake, And
Bree Won't Forgive Me.

700
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:20,690
<I>You See,That's The Problem
With The Brees Of This World.</I>

701
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,810
They're Too Damn Perfect.

702
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,250
I Mean, They Don't Understand

703
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:28,030
That People Like You And Me
- Well,That We Screw Up.

704
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:30,390
Yeah,Well, This Was
No Ordinary Mistake.

705
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:33,900
This Was-This Was
Something Terrible.

706
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,720
Was It Something Gay?

707
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:36,770
What?

708
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:39,570
Of Course It
Wasn't. Keep Talking.

709
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,440
Trust Me.

710
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,180
Bree Will Never Forgive Me.

711
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,870
You Know What?
Maybe She Shouldn't.

712
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,420
Maybe I'm Not Worthy
Of Forgiveness.

713
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,120
Well...

714
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,040
Are You Sorry
For What You Did?

715
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,400
Yes. More Than
Anyone Will Ever Know.

716
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,310
Well,Then You're Worthy.

717
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:09,490
Thank You,Edie.

718
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:12,750
Mm. Don't Start.

719
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,460
I'm Drunk. I'm Gonna
Start Crying,Too.

720
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,230
<I>Come On.</I>

721
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,030
You're A Good
Person, Edie Britt.

722
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,440
Well,You're Not
So Bad Yourself.

723
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,660
Mm,I Don't
- I Don't Think We Should...

724
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:35,930
You're Right.

725
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,270
Bad Idea.

726
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:42,130
I Blame The Hodge Formula.

727
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,890
Yes.

728
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,980
You're Probably Tired.

729
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:52,170
Let Me Get Your
Room Ready For You.

730
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:06,770
Mom?

731
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:08,780
Can I Talk To You?

732
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,080
Of Course.

733
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,650
I Guess I Just Have To Say It.

734
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:22,220
I've Been Lying To You.

735
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,490
There Is No Boy.

736
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:27,040
And?

737
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,430
And...

738
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,420
Well,I've Been Meeting
Someone. That Part Is True.

739
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,100
But It's Dad.

740
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,540
I've Been Meeting Dad.

741
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,870
Really?

742
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,670
So... You're Not Upset?

743
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:51,560
You Made It Very Clear That
You Wanted To Meet Your Father,

744
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,080
So I Knew This Day Was Coming,

745
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,030
And I Prepared Myself.

746
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:00,650
Well, Can I Go Get Him,Then?

747
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,350
Come In! She Says It's Okay.

748
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,130
Hey,Kathy.

749
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,350
Been A Long Time.

750
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,670
Dylan,Why Don't You
Go Up To Your Room

751
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:31,150
So We Can Catch Up?

752
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,450
It's All Right,Really.

753
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:38,870
Go Ahead,Honey.

754
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,670
You Did A Great Job With Her.

755
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:48,830
She's,Uh, She's
A Wonderful Girl.

756
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:54,810
You Look Fantastic.

757
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,970
Haven't Aged A Day.

758
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,780
Look,I'm Here For Dylan,Okay?

759
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,270
I'm Sure That's
What You Told Her,

760
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,960
And I'm Sure She
Believed It...

761
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:13,380
Because She Doesn't Know You.

762
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,060
But I Do.

763
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:19,750
No,You Don't,Kathy,
Not Anymore.

764
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:21,940
It's Been A Long Time
- 12 Years.

765
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,110
I Know Exactly
How Long It's Been.

766
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,930
Okay. Good,

767
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,070
Because,Um... I've Changed.

768
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,530
I'm A Different Man Now.

769
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:37,370
Well,You Have To Admit
That That's Possible,Right?

770
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,250
You've Changed,Huh?

771
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,740
Well,Maybe You Have.

772
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:45,080
I Have. Like To Know How?

773
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:48,220
Sure... If You Wanna Tell Me.

774
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,540
I'm Not Scared Of You Anymore.

775
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,720
Good.

776
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,350
You Don't Have To Be.

777
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,970
I'm Not The Same Woman
You Knocked Around,

778
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,560
The Woman You Punched...

779
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,760
Choked...

780
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:11,540
The One Whose Blood You
Licked Off Your Knuckles.

781
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,520
She's Gone.

782
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:19,180
So You'll Just Have To
Prove You're A Man...

783
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:22,140
Some Other Way.

784
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,920
You Trying To
Make Me Mad,Kathy?

785
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,490
I Didn't Know I Still Could.

786
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,490
Can I?

787
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,880
This Is A Lot To Deal
With After So Long,I Guess.

788
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:48,260
I Shouldn't Have Sprung
It On You All At Once.

789
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,070
Tell Dylan I'll
Call Her Tomorrow.

790
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,680
And You're As Beautiful
As You Ever Were,Kath.

791
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,810
Good Night.

792
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:26,090
<I>The Word "Welcome"
Always Carries With It</I>

793
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:28,380
<I>A Certain Amount Of Risk.</I>

794
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:29,740
<I>After All,</I>

795
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:34,870
<I>To Let Someone Into Your Home
Is To Let Them Into Your Life.</I>

796
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:40,230
<I>And We Never Know What
Sorts Of Horrible Secrets</I>

797
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,300
<I>They Carry With Them.</I>

798
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,570
<I>We Can't Foresee
The Painful Effect</I>

799
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,150
<I>They Might Have
On Our Loved Ones.</I>

800
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,520
<I>We Don't Anticipate The
Gossip That Could Result</I>

801
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,460
<I>From Their Presence.</I>

802
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:03,430
<I>Yes...</I>

803
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,510
<I>We Must Be Very Careful</I>

804
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:08,540
<I>With Those We Invite
Into Our Lives...</I>

805
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:11,370
<I>Because Some...</I>

806
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,910
<I>Will Refuse To Leave.</I>

807
