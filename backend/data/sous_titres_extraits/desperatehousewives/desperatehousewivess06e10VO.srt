1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,690
Previously on...

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,040
Orson's blackmailing
me to stay with him.

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:06,590
- To escape her marriage...
- Lamar Benjamin?

4
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,340
You know my husband Orson
from the state penitentiary.

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,940
Bree arranged her own blackmail...

6
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,040
I don't want to fight anymore.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,590
While a friendship...

8
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,340
- Hit the rocks.
- Lynette, you wanted to Sue us!

9
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,200
That proves that you are not my friend.

10
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,640
- Oh, my God!
- All right, calm down. All right? I'm not an idiot.

11
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,540
I used a prepaid, and there's no
way they're ever gonna find us.

12
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,440
- I killed a man.
- A desperate act...

13
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,300
Danny? No, no, no, no, no, no!

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,400
Led to a revelation.

15
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,050
Would you like some juice, Danny?

16
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,890
My name's Tyler.

17
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,100
The whole time I was with you,
all I thought about was Susan.

18
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,570
And a revelation...

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,800
If you mean it, then please kill me.

20
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,560
I don't care enough
about you to kill you.

21
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,510
Led to a desperate act.

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,460
I need an ambulance right
away. I'm losing a lot of blood.

23
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,260
Daphne Bicks was an unhappy woman.

24
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,270
And no one knew this
better than her husband.

25
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,220
That's why he hired
her to work with him.

26
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,020
He thought it might cheer her up.

27
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,620
But sadly, Jeff Bicks soon discovered

28
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,120
that it would take a
lot more than a job...

29
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,820
This coffee's cold.

30
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,670
To keep his wife from complaining.

31
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,570
She complained from the moment
they got up in the morning...

32
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,920
Well, another sleepless
night thanks to your snoring.

33
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,520
Till they were on their way
home at the end of the day.

34
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,720
You want to see if you
can hit all the red lights?

35
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,420
Things had gotten so bad,

36
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,370
Jeff Bicks began to wonder

37
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,740
when God would end his suffering.

38
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,440
Luckily for Jeff, God had a plan.

39
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,000
You're unbelievable! You're so cheap.

40
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,650
It's friggin' Christmas, for God sake.

41
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,610
I'm not buying you a new car.

42
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,810
Tricia Reed's husband got her a new car.

43
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,210
It isn't even a holiday.

44
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,710
He bought it for her
because she beat cancer.

45
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,010
You beat cancer, I'll buy you a
car. Don't beat it, I'll buy you two.

46
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,010
- Why are we even together?
- The hot sex.

47
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,660
You're cheap, rude. You lack ambition.

48
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,860
I should just dump your sorry ass.

49
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,380
You want a gift? You want
a gift? How about a divorce?

50
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,930
- Ha. Don't tempt me.
- I'm serious.

51
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,080
I already got the name
of a divorce attorney.

52
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,140
You want a divorce? You got it!

53
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,440
Yes, Virginia,

54
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,790
there is a Santa claus, and
he's giving me my balls back!

55
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,990
Correction... one of them.
Get half of everything.

56
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,300
But not the business. I started that.

57
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,040
With my father's money. So I
get half, and I'm selling it.

58
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,050
Wait a minute. Let's talk about this.

59
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,010
Oh-ho! So now you're scared?

60
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,120
You'd be that vindictive? Destroy
the one thing I love out of spite?

61
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,870
Hello?! Have we met? Of course I would.

62
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,760
And I am not stopping there.
Bank accounts, pension funds...

63
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,320
Oh, I'm gonna ruin you.

64
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,920
Oh, what's the matter?

65
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,470
I can't breathe.

66
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,170
Nice try, big faker.

67
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,420
Oh! My chest hurts like hell.

68
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,470
- Take the controls.
- What?

69
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,720
Ah! You gotta land the plane.

70
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,810
What?!

71
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,700
No! You piece of crap!

72
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,750
You can't do this to me!

73
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,850
And that is how the unhappy marriage

74
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,760
of Jeff and Daphne Bicks ended...

75
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,150
In a plane losing altitude

76
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,760
right above
a cul-de-sac...

77
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,960
Hey, is it just me,

78
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,860
or is that plane flying really low?

79
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,460
By the name of Wisteria Lane.

80
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,230
Dad, I think it's gonna crash.

81
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,600
The best Christmas ever...

82
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,650
That's what the residents of
Wisteria Lane were dreaming of

83
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,310
as they prepared for their
annual yuletide festival.

84
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,610
So they hung up a banner...

85
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,120
Brought out their xandy canes...

86
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,860
And put up Santa's workshop,

87
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,460
as eager as children
for the holiday to begin.

88
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,760
Of course,

89
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,870
some were more childish than others.

90
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,420
Look at this mess.
It's like Santa's colon.

91
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,670
- That's funny. Did you hear that?
- Hilarious.

92
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,040
Almost as funny as when
Orson said it last year.

93
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,010
Okay. How about some Christmas music?

94
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,860
Parker, you got that sound system fixed?

95
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,300
Almost.

96
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,210
Do we really want the kid
working with electricity?

97
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,310
He can't even get the
newspaper on my porch.

98
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,420
You're clumping.

99
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,820
- Hey, what is going on with you two?
- I don't want to get into it.

100
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,580
Well, whatever it is,
you need to work it out.

101
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,740
We are caroling at the
festival on Saturday,

102
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,250
and we can't have two of
our jingle belles fighting.

103
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,390
You know, if you need a replacement,
I've been told that I have a dusky alto.

104
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,040
No way!

105
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,100
Girls only. We're the jingle
belles, not the jingle balls.

106
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,220
Shouldn't you be out stealing
the last can of who hash?

107
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,920
You want to see me go
all grinch on your ass?

108
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,220
To be honest, Bree, I don't think I'm gonna
be able to sing with Lynette after she was...

109
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,870
After she what? Are
you about to trash me?

110
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,370
I have way too much class to trash
you, no matter how much you deserve it.

111
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,120
Merry Christmas to me.

112
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,730
What did she do?

113
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,120
- She's suing Carlos.
- You're suing him?

114
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,990
- Because he fired me.
- He fired her?

115
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,590
- Because she lied about being pregnant.
- You're pregnant?!

116
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,840
- With twins.
- You knew?

117
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,390
I told her to keep it quiet.

118
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,050
- Congratulations.
- Sure, take her side.

119
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,050
She's not!

120
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,950
Stop fighting.

121
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,850
I mean, with all we've
been through lately...

122
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,800
Julie being attacked,
Danny bolen's overdose...

123
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,960
We really need some
Christmas spirit around here.

124
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,550
- Susan's right.
- This is the time

125
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,070
we should come together

126
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,690
and celebrate peace on earth
and good will towards men and...

127
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,300
Oh, crap. Who's dead now?

128
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,700
- Hey, what's going on?
- Something's happened to Katherine.

129
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,750
Oh, my God. I was just
there five minutes ago.

130
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,160
- Was she okay?
- Well, she was really upset.

131
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,360
I hope she didn't do
something to herself.

132
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,800
Hey, you're not gonna believe
this, but I just heard the cops say

133
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,910
that someone stabbed
Katherine right in the gut.

134
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,210
- What?
- Who would do that?

135
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,410
You've got to be kidding me.

136
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,160
Hey there. How you feeling?

137
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,770
A little hungry.

138
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,320
That's 'cause they pumped your stomach.

139
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,730
But if you want, Tyler, I can
have them bring you some soup.

140
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,680
Why did you just call me that?

141
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,830
- You told me to, last night.
- No, I didn't.

142
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,430
Yes, you did. Twice.

143
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,580
You were still a little groggy, but
you definitely said your name was Tyler.

144
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,480
Um, maybe I was dreaming.

145
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,580
My name's Danny.

146
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:34,780
Okay.

147
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,990
Um, can I see my mom?

148
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,440
Please.

149
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,890
I'm sorry. Not while
you're under observation.

150
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,680
I'll have someone bring you that soup...

151
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,330
Danny.

152
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,440
I don't get this. We gave you
a check to cover the ambulance

153
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,640
- and everything else so far.
- I know.

154
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,400
But we still need your
insurance information, Mr. Bolen.

155
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,890
- It's hospital policy.
- Like us not being able to see our kid?

156
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,850
So you have two stupid policies.

157
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,590
There could be some unforeseen expenses,

158
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,350
tests we may have to run.

159
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,250
If you don't have insurance,
there are government programs.

160
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,750
- If you could just give me your information...
- No!

161
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,610
- We don't need a handout.
- We have Cash.

162
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,010
- Thank you, though.
- Gayle.

163
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,610
Can I speak with the bolens?

164
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,480
I know what's going on.

165
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,030
What do you mean?

166
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,190
I knew something was up the
moment you moved onto the Lane.

167
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,680
I mean... you never
talk about your past.

168
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,340
Well, we're private people.
Is there a law against that?

169
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,380
Having no insurance, wanting
to pay Cash for everything,

170
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,140
having a son who can't remember
if his name is Danny or Tyler...

171
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,540
Where you going with all this, Mona?

172
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,290
You're in the witness
protection program, aren't you?

173
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,470
You are one sharp cookie.

174
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,430
How'd you figure it out?

175
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,260
Honestly? Once I noticed you were
Italian, I just kinda went from there.

176
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,450
No offense.

177
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,310
None taken.

178
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,400
I can't believe I'm right.

179
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,710
So... what went down?

180
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,260
You witness a hit?

181
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,010
Did you rat on one of the five families?

182
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,660
We, um... we can't talk about it, Mona.

183
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,580
And neither can you, to anybody.

184
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,380
Of course not.

185
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,080
Because if you do say anything...

186
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,430
We're gonna have to have you whacked.

187
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,950
Any more news about Mike and Katherine?

188
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,600
No.

189
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,450
But I'm sure he'll be exonerated.

190
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,100
Mike could never do
something that awful.

191
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:13,000
That's my Bree... always
seeing the good in people.

192
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,420
Yes.

193
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,210
Well, um...

194
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,760
Forgive me for starting
your day on a sour note,

195
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,660
but I filed for divorce.
Here are the papers.

196
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,610
And if you try to stop me,

197
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,420
your parole officer will see these.

198
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,750
Consorting with a known
felon is a parole violation.

199
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,400
If you send me to jail for fraud,

200
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,850
you're going with me.

201
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,600
It's over, Orson.

202
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,460
This must have been
quite a project for you...

203
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,000
Finding lamar, setting up the camera.

204
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,410
Sorry to put you through
so much needless trouble.

205
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,890
I would hardly say needless.

206
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,540
Without these, you'd still
have a gun to my head.

207
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,650
Do you really think I
would send you to jail?

208
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,000
It's what you've been threatening.

209
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,000
I was bluffing, Bree,
right from the start.

210
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,060
I could never hurt you
that badly, no matter what.

211
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,450
Y... you didn't need these.

212
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,060
You could've called my bluff
and walked away anytime.

213
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,260
I suppose the fact that you did believe
me, that you actually thought I'd destroy

214
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,520
you just out of spite, that alone
should've told me it was over.

215
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,790
I will pack after breakfast.

216
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,490
For what it's worth, I'm
sorry it had to end this way.

217
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,190
Me, too.

218
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:48,060
These scones you made are delicious.

219
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,350
I'll miss them.

220
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,210
Here's Katherine's room.

221
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,920
Now you might hear some screams
for help in there. Ignore them.

222
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,870
Is that what you meant by, "I'll
behave calmly and rationally"?

223
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,470
That was just to get you
to unlock the car door.

224
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,170
Susan, you gotta go in there and
be Katherine mayfair's best friend,

225
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,870
- because she could put Mike away for a very long time.
- I know. I know.

226
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,220
Might help if you give her these.

227
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,370
Good idea. She pisses me off, I
can crack the vase over her head.

228
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,890
No, Dylan. The police have
everything under control.

229
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,050
There's no reason for
you to fly out here.

230
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,100
Uh, honey, I... I've got
a visitor. I gotta go.

231
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,050
Okay, talk to you later.

232
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,710
Susan, come in.

233
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,910
Hi, Katherine.

234
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,160
What a sweet gift.

235
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,170
I didn't even think I'd see you here.

236
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,620
Well, I was... concerned
about you, Katherine.

237
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,180
A lot of people are.

238
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,330
Actually, the one they should
be concerned about is you.

239
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,380
Why is that?

240
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,680
Because the man you just married
turned out to be a maniac.

241
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,030
Yeah, um...

242
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,490
about that... uh...

243
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,850
we both know...

244
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,850
that Mike didn't do this.

245
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,700
Really?

246
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,350
I've got seven stitches

247
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,810
and a knife with Mike's fingerprints

248
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,710
that say otherwise.

249
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,660
It doesn't make...

250
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,470
Ny sense.

251
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,720
Why would Mike

252
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,720
want to stab you?

253
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,970
Well, if you must know...

254
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,170
I told him I was in
love with someone else,

255
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,520
and he flew into a rage.

256
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,670
Will you stop lying?

257
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,020
If you don't tell the truth soon, you
are sending an innocent man to jail.

258
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,380
You are taking a father
away from his son.

259
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,330
It's Mike's fault, not mine.

260
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,030
Katherine, please!

261
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,380
Ven though I am so angry with him,

262
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,830
when you think about it, it's
really kind of flattering...

263
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,330
To go this far to keep me
from being with someone else.

264
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,940
So how did it go?

265
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,490
I don't know anymore.

266
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,650
I can't tell if she's
crazy or just devious.

267
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,010
I think she's a little of both.

268
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,310
Okay.

269
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,010
So tell me how I get
the crazy part committed.

270
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:10,060
Only a family member can commit
somebody to an institution.

271
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,070
Really?

272
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,010
Excuse me. I was just
with my friend Katherine

273
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,260
in 607, and she was
talking to her daughter,

274
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:25,120
- and she wanted me to follow up about something.
- Do you have that number?

275
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,020
Dylan mayfair?

276
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,520
- Yes. Would you mind dialing that number?
- Certainly.

277
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,020
There you go.

278
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,670
Hello.

279
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,780
This is Dr. Brewster calling
from Fairview General.

280
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:50,140
I understand that you were
just speaking with your moth

281
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,380
right.

282
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,120
Well, I do feel, given her condition,

283
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,970
it is important for you
to come here if you can.

284
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,920
Lovely.

285
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,880
See you soon.

286
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,740
Ow that's devious.

287
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,290
50 cents off paper towels...

288
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,600
that's a great coupon.

289
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,050
This is fun. Yeah, it sure is.

290
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,550
And me doing my own
roots is gonna be fun,

291
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,950
and getting rid of cable is gonna be fun.
We're gonna be having so much fun around here.

292
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,800
Mommy? Are we poor?

293
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,800
Oh. Only financially.

294
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:32,810
Hey. Hey, don't forget that one.

295
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,860
RaviolI in a can? I like poor food!

296
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,810
What'd they say?

297
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,260
I've attended classes for six weeks.

298
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,660
They won't refund any of my tuition.

299
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,470
Unbelievable.

300
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,410
Is there a sign over us
that says "crap here"?

301
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,520
It'll be okay. I'm looking for a job,

302
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:59,320
and in the meantime, we got enough money
to live on for the next... mm, four months?

303
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,460
So we'll run out right
before the babies are born.

304
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,070
Es, but remember,

305
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,670
kids don't miss what they never had.

306
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,580
Ah, like food, clothing, sober mother?

307
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,430
I am so sorry.

308
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,230
For what?

309
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,280
For what I have done to this family.

310
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,780
You have to drop out of school.

311
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,080
Penny is clipping coupons.

312
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:30,690
have really, really screwed this up.

313
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,830
Well, we'll get some money
if we win the lawsuit.

314
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,540
Yeah. Won't that be great?

315
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,390
Living off the money we made

316
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,490
suing our best friends.

317
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,040
At least Gaby tried to
apologize and stop this.

318
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,550
Well...

319
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,850
Maybe it's your turn.

320
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,620
Damn it!

321
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,770
Whatever it is, I can explain.

322
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,570
That was the chairman of my board.

323
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,780
This Lynette thing is
turning into a fiasco.

324
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,670
I thought that lawyer said you did
everything by the book, that we were covered.

325
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,130
It doesn't matter what the lawyer said.

326
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,820
Bottom line is, it looks
bad for global venture...

327
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,430
big corporation going
after a pregnant woman.

328
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,530
So what's gonna happen?

329
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,540
If this suit goes to trial...

330
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,580
I'm done.

331
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,180
And even if it doesn't,
I might still lose my job.

332
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,990
I've put everything into this company.

333
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,740
Carlos.

334
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,700
Carlos!

335
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,190
Hi. I know I'm probably the
last person you want to talk to.

336
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:49,940
You got that right.

337
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,240
It's, uh, done, Karl.

338
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,440
Orson signed the papers.

339
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,240
Yes, uh, I know.

340
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,500
I've never been happier.

341
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,950
I absolutely want to see you, too.

342
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,200
Uh, meet me at the motel,

343
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,150
and we'll find a way to celebrate.

344
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,700
Till then, my darling.

345
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,250
When you move on, you
don't waste any time.

346
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,160
I'm sorry.

347
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,920
I wanted to tell you
this morning, but I...

348
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,470
Felt I'd hurt you enough for one day.

349
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,420
Yes. Much better to parcel out the pain.

350
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,330
Is it someone I know?

351
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,710
No, no, never mind.

352
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,910
I can't handle that right now.

353
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,010
Just, uh, tell me this...

354
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:47,110
Have you told your friends
you're seeing anyone?

355
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,960
Of course not.

356
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,510
Good.

357
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,820
Please don't until I'm gone.

358
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,570
I'm saying goodbye to
everyone at the party tomorrow.

359
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,920
I don't want it to turn into
a pity fest for poor Orson.

360
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,930
I won't go public with
my new relationship

361
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,870
until we're divorced.

362
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,530
And I'll say we started
seeing each other...

363
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,540
After you and I separate.

364
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,230
What a tasteful solution.

365
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,090
You must write an etiquette
book for adulterers.

366
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,530
I don't blame you for being angry.

367
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,390
And I give you my word,
I will not let my affair

368
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,440
be an embarrassment to you.

369
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,440
So when the plane flies
over the Christmas party,

370
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,040
I want it pulling a
big-ass banner that reads,

371
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,190
"will you marry me, Bree?

372
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,890
Love, Karl."

373
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,240
- Oh, isn't that romantic?
- Glorious. That'll be 600 bucks.

374
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,440
I don't care. You can't
put a price on love.

375
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,240
He can. Our anniversary?

376
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,500
$20 gift certificate to a rib joint.

377
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,150
Well, you didn't have to Cook that
night. So the gift was for both of us.

378
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,850
Good luck, Mr. Mayer.

379
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,850
I hope this Bree says yes...

380
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,200
Almost as much as I wish I had said no.

381
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,400
For what it's worth,
I'm a divorce lawyer.

382
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,600
Oh, for God sake! Jeff,
look at the mess in here!

383
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,930
Dylan. Dylan.

384
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,640
I have nothing to say to you.

385
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,840
I know what your mother
must have told you.

386
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,340
It's what she told
everyone. But it's not true.

387
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,540
Do you really think I'm gonna
take your word over hers?

388
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,640
Please. I am so worried about your mom.

389
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:44,140
- I am not just thinking about Mike.
- The hell you're not.

390
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,540
Get over him. He's married to my mother.

391
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,390
- What?
- You know,

392
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,000
it's bad enough that you
make a scene at their wedding

393
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,950
and you hound them night and day.

394
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,000
And you stab her because
you can't have him?

395
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,090
Is that what she told you?

396
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,990
I don't know why you're
not locked up right now.

397
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,400
Ou're crazy.

398
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,200
Dylan!

399
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,150
We need to talk.

400
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,560
Oh, my God.

401
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,910
I don't understand.

402
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,910
For months, my mom has been telling me

403
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,960
about her life with Mike...

404
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,910
the gifts that he's given her
and trips that they've planned.

405
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,810
Your mom needs help.

406
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,110
And so does Mike.

407
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,670
What do you want me to do?

408
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,170
Hey, good news.

409
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:52,210
Dr. Cheng says I can give your
parents an early Christmas present.

410
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,170
You're released. Grab your
stuff. I'm taking you home.

411
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,730
Hey, thanks for the ride. Happy to help.

412
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,830
I can't imagine how tough it is
for you guys to live this way.

413
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,470
What way?

414
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,270
Running all these years,

415
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,880
always looking over your shoulder.

416
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,980
Relax, Danny. Your parents
told me about your situation.

417
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,780
Well, actually, I figured it out.

418
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,830
Your mom just filled in the details.

419
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,280
Why would she do that?

420
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,430
Well, frankly, I think she was
glad to finally find someone

421
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,190
she could be honest with.

422
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:41,940
And that goes for you, too.

423
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,440
If you ever need to
talk, you can trust me.

424
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,690
I hope so.

425
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,290
'Cause if you say anything,
they're gonna throw my mom in jail.

426
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,240
No, no. It doesn't work that way.

427
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,740
Are you kidding?

428
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,050
Ever since 9/11, the feds

429
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,150
are hard-core on any terrorist stuff,

430
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,100
even the old cases.

431
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,400
If they find her, she's dead.

432
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,750
What do you mean?

433
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,510
Danny! I thought we were picking you up

434
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,560
- tomorrow.
- Ma, I screwed up.

435
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,960
What are you talking about?

436
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,360
I told Mona everything.

437
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,330
Hey, Mona.

438
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,930
Thanks for giving Danny a ride.

439
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:00,630
And, oh, I am so sorry he
dragged you into our family drama.

440
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,790
I mean, you know better than anyone
what a bad head space he's in right now.

441
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,530
He's so angry at me and his
dad, he just wants to hurt us,

442
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,730
which would explain the
wild story he just told you.

443
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,790
So... we good?

444
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,690
I hate my job.

445
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,050
All I do is deal with disturbed people,

446
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,290
wipe their drool,

447
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,190
strap them down.

448
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,250
I hate it.

449
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:43,500
Well...maybe you should
get a different job.

450
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,950
I wanted to,

451
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,350
but they say you should have a
year's worth of living expenses.

452
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,350
And I didn't know
where I'd get the money.

453
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,860
$67,000.

454
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,810
That's what I've needed
to cover my mortgage,

455
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,510
my car, everything for a year.

456
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:05,660
- Mona...
- 67 grand.

457
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,010
If you could do that for me,

458
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,810
then we'd all be free.

459
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,570
Hey, mom.

460
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:25,930
Dylan! What are you doing here?

461
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,290
I... I asked you not to come.

462
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:31,130
I had to. You were hurt.

463
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,780
Have you been to the house?

464
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,280
Oh, I'm so sorry Mike
wasn't there to welcome you.

465
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,630
He's away on business.

466
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,540
No, he's in jail.

467
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,340
You told the police he stabbed you.

468
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,840
I... never said that.

469
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,690
I told you... Susan attacked me.

470
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,090
Then why did the police arrest Mike?

471
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,590
I don't know.

472
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:05,290
Maybe he confessed to protect her.

473
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,000
Mom, Susan's his wife.

474
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,360
That's ridiculous.

475
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,760
What... who told you that? Susan?

476
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,850
No. Mike.

477
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,420
They let me speak with him.

478
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,570
Mom, Mike is in jail, and that's
not right if he didn't do anything.

479
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,670
Did you stab yourself?

480
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,670
Mom, did you?

481
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,980
I asked you not to come.

482
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,190
- Oh, mom.
- You don't understand.

483
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,080
Susan trapped him,

484
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,930
filled his head with lies.

485
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,940
This is gonna save him.

486
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:04,690
He knows why I did it. He wants this.

487
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,240
What is she doing here?

488
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,290
I wanna help you, Katherine.

489
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,500
I have to get to Mike.
He's expecting me.

490
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,850
- I can fix it. You'll see! I have to go!
- Mom, please.

491
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,700
Mrs. Mayfair!

492
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,100
- Oh! We need a little help here.
- Mom, please!

493
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,050
Everything's gonna be wonderful!

494
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,700
No, I have to get to Mike!

495
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,520
No! No! Get your hands off
of me! Need some help here.

496
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,160
No! No! No!

497
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,850
Please, Mrs. Mayfair,
we're trying to help you.

498
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,100
Okay, it... it... it's okay.
Honey, everything's gonna be okay.

499
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,500
I asked you not to come.

500
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:09,800
- Hey, wait up. I wanna go with you.
- Can't I have one moment of peace?

501
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,200
Our therapist said we need
to do more stuff together.

502
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,000
- I know. That's why I don't go to the therapist with you.
- Oh, come on.

503
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,660
Would it kill you to spend some
time with the woman you love?

504
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,660
I don't know. Would you
be upset if I brought her?

505
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,460
As long as she doesn't
deflate in the plane.

506
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:31,160
Gaby, please talk to
me. I feel just awful.

507
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,110
You know why? Because you are awful.

508
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,810
You're an awful person. Okay, you
have every right to be mad at me.

509
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:38,420
Thanks, Lynette, and you have every
right to go to hell. Stop talking to me!

510
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,760
Thank you, all, for coming out
to our annual holiday festival.

511
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,420
And, as it's been our
tradition these last 12 years,

512
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,050
please welcome back the jingle belles.

513
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,310
All right, ladies. Sparkle!

514
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,850
I can't believe they wouldn't
let you sing with them.

515
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:02,410
It's their group. They can
do whatever they want. Whores.

516
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,910
* silent night

517
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,460
* Holy night...

518
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,160
Do you mind? You're blocking
me with your big fat head.

519
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,310
I thought we weren't talking.

520
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:20,410
* 'round yon virgin mo...

521
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,060
you know, I was trying to apologize.

522
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,520
Well, it's too late. Carlos
is probably gonna lose his job

523
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,060
over this stuff you're
putting him through.

524
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,060
Well, gee, I wonder
what that feels like.

525
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,400
* sleep in heavenly peace...

526
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,400
By the way, because
your husband canned me,

527
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,090
tom had to quit school.

528
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,150
Aw, the 45-year-old
freshman has to drop out?

529
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:39,800
Maybe he'll get a paper route. Move!

530
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:40,950
No.

531
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,760
Fine. You want to be a jerk?

532
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,310
Gaby give me my hat back.

533
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,910
- No! No!
- Gaby, give me my hat back!

534
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,660
Gaby, give it back!

535
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,160
All is calm! All is calm!

536
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,760
- Don't look at me. She's the one who started it!
- She's being a bitch.

537
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,610
I don't remember the word
"bitch" being in the song.

538
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,410
Oh, no, it's always been there.

539
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,370
You are... aah!

540
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,130
And we will be right
back. Have a little punch.

541
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,430
I realize you two are having
a problem... a giant problem.

542
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,680
And now half of fairview does, too.

543
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,480
So, "a," you're fired,

544
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,330
and "b," work it out.

545
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:34,930
Gaby, I'm sorry about
everything, but you have no idea

546
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,680
what losing my job
has done to my family.

547
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,430
Oh, boo-hoo, you.

548
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,530
Why don't you slip your cankles
into my shoes and walk a mile?

549
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,190
You just don't care
about anyone but yourself.

550
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,540
Yes, I do. I care about my friends.

551
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,190
Sorry you are no longer
a part of that Group.

552
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,790
I'm in. It's a Christmas miracle!

553
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:05,440
We can't just let some stupid
housewife shake us down for 67 Grand.

554
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,150
We gotta try to make this go away.

555
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:14,050
We got the emergency 10 grand, but
that is a long way from $67,000.

556
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,900
Oh...

557
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,100
Maybe this'll get us closer.

558
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,500
Now do be careful, you little munchkins.

559
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:28,750
Excuse me.

560
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,410
Excuse me.

561
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,300
Karl? What are you doing here?

562
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,510
I just thought I'd come and give
you an early Christmas present.

563
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,110
Stop it! We can't be seen together.

564
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,260
What's the big deal? Susan
knows. The cat's out of the bag.

565
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,360
- Orson doesn't know.
- You didn't tell him?

566
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,910
About the affair, yes. But
he has no idea it's you.

567
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,670
Now, Karl, please go.

568
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,760
I promised him there'd
be no scenes today.

569
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,170
Karl? Oh, lord.

570
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,410
Hey, Orson. Just came by
to check on the decorations.

571
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:02,370
- Great job, Mrs. Hodge.
- Save it, Karl. I'm not an idiot.

572
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:06,610
You obviously heard
Bree and I are divorcing,

573
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,920
and, vulture that you are,
you've swooped in to make

574
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,820
a Buck by representing Bree.

575
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,970
Hey, a man's gotta eat. Perhaps.

576
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:19,620
But soliciting business
at a Christmas party?

577
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:22,430
That's tacky, even for you, Karl.

578
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:26,320
If this is who you want
representing you, that's your choice.

579
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,880
But frankly, I thought
you had higher standards.

580
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,130
Remind me not to let him
make a toast at our wedding.

581
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,830
It's not funny, Karl. Now just
go before he figures it out.

582
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:43,390
Yeah, about that... uh, y... you know
that Christmas present I mentioned?

583
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,730
Don't you dare give me a present
in front of all these people!

584
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:49,590
I'm not sure I can stop it.
It's being delivered... by air.

585
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,190
Karl, what did you do?

586
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,890
Just let me make one quick call.

587
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,910
Mayday! Mayday!

588
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,020
God, how do you turn this thing on?

589
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:08,040
Somebody help! I don't know how to fly!

590
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,190
Okay, I released the banner. Now what?

591
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,250
Look for a place to land...
a field, a large parking lot.

592
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,790
All I see are neighborhoods.

593
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,040
Negative. Street
landing is too dangerous.

594
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,700
Well, that's all there is!
What do you want from me?!

595
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,090
Okay, calm down. Keep her steady.

596
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,900
Jeff, it's Karl. Are you there?

597
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,500
Hello?

598
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,050
Come on, pick up. Okay.

599
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,050
If you get this message, and
please, please get this message...

600
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,250
You need to abort. Do not, repeat,

601
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,460
do not fly over Wisteria
Park with that banner.

602
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,250
- What banner?
- Call me.

603
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,950
Karl, what banner?

604
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,500
You know how you're always saying
to me I should be more romantic?

605
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:58,150
Well, I thought, what if I hire a plane

606
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,860
to fly over Bree's street carrying a
banner with a heartfelt personal message?

607
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,860
Karl, when you put a message on a
banner, it ceases to be personal.

608
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,420
What does it say?

609
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,770
Uh, something like, uh... "Bree,
will you marry me? Love Karl."

610
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,690
Oh, dear God!

611
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,940
- I was trying to be romantic.
- Karl, when we began this affair,

612
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,490
we agreed to be discreet.

613
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:19,490
Do you know what discreet
means? No skywriting!

614
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,180
Oh, God! Poor Orson!

615
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,530
Do you know how humiliated he'll be?

616
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:29,890
- I have to warn him.
- Bree, wait.

617
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,700
I made this mess.

618
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,750
I'll deal with it.

619
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,100
Orson deserves the truth,

620
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:38,000
and he should hear it
from me, not a banner.

621
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:39,550
But I...

622
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,460
You got a minute? I need to talk to you.

623
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:48,710
What, here?

624
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:50,020
Can't it wait?

625
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,910
Uh, not really.

626
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,670
Uh... if this is about the settlement,

627
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,010
I told Bree there's very little I want.

628
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,220
That's not the problem.

629
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:07,270
It's what I want... Bree.

630
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,770
You're too late. She has a boyfriend.

631
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,070
- You?
- Hey, if I were a betting man,

632
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,120
I've lost a bundle on this, too.

633
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,970
S... so wait.

634
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:25,180
Y... you're having sex with my wife?

635
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,290
The point is,

636
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:30,150
we don't wanna make this any
harder for you than it has to be.

637
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,960
I...I just wanted to warn
you that in a few minutes...

638
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,100
Okay, you're the husband.
I'll give you that one.

639
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,600
I'm trying to spare your
feelings, which is why...

640
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,810
That's it. The hell with your feelings.

641
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,960
I am proposing to Bree today

642
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,710
with an airplane banner.

643
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,910
And trust me, that will be
the highlight of your day!

644
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,560
One moment, please.

645
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,060
- Hi.
- Hi!

646
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,770
Have you been to see Santa yet?

647
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,270
- Unh-unh. - You
want me to take you?

648
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,920
- Yeah? Okay.
- Celia!

649
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,520
Come on. I will take you to see Santa.

650
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,380
Hey.

651
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,730
Oh. We're gonna do this
right here? Just like that?

652
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,980
This seems like a pretty small
envelope for such a big secret.

653
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,090
It's 10 Grand. And... and my wedding
ring. It was my grandmother's.

654
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,230
It's all we have right now.

655
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:52,890
But... I... I gave
notice at the hospital.

656
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:54,590
I... I can't go back there.

657
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:57,410
Mona, that's the best we can do.

658
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,770
I... I have a job at Bree's. I...
I... I could pay the rest as I make it.

659
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:04,720
Sure, until you disappear into thin air.

660
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:10,070
Just because I have lawn
gnomes doesn't mean I'm stupid.

661
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,420
You... you don't know the whole story.

662
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:16,020
I know you killed someone
and walked away scot-free.

663
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,430
Scot-free?

664
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,720
Does this look scot-free?

665
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,430
Yeah, I don't think Danny
told you the whole story,

666
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,730
but maybe you should hear it.

667
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,430
4 miles I ran today,

668
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,580
and now I'm drinking eggnog.

669
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,930
It's like mayonnaise with rum in it.

670
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,040
Excuse me.

671
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,150
What are you doing?! Stop it!

672
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:04,520
This is ridiculous! Please!

673
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,270
Oh, for God sakes, stop it!

674
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,220
... and that was 18 years ago, and we've
been looking over our shoulders ever since

675
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,370
that sounds like a
very reasonable story...

676
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:16,220
So reasonable that I don't
understand why you couldn't

677
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,720
just call the police right
now and explain it to them.

678
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:22,720
Someone's dead. You
know I can't do that.

679
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,530
What I know is you've got till tomorrow
to come up with the rest of the money,

680
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:28,820
or I go to the police. Capisce?

681
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:36,730
Is it just me, or is that
plane flying really low?

682
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,230
Mona, can we talk about this?
Don't do this. You are screwing

683
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,780
with people's lives here. This
could blow up in your face.

684
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,890
$67,000 by tomorrow

685
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,240
or I call the police.

686
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,090
House. House. House!

687
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,940
Hey, we're not done here.

688
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,750
You can run, but you can't hide!

689
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:23,330
Celia!

690
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:43,400
The best Christmas ever...

691
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,200
That's what everyone had wanted.

692
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,110
But something went wrong.

693
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,560
Horribly wrong.

694
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,200
For those who survived,

695
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:03,410
it would be a day they
would try to forget.

696
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,210
For those who didn't,

697
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:11,960
this Christmas would
simply be their last.
