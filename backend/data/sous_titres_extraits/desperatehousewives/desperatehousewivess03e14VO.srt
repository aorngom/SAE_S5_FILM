00:00:00,101 --> 00:00:02,500
<i>Previously on Desperate Housewives...</i>

2
00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:05,600
<i>Ian's wife Jane passed away.</i>

3
00:00:05,848 --> 00:00:07,500
<i>Gaby made a new friend.</i>

4
00:00:07,601 --> 00:00:09,500
A "friend" friend, not a girlfriend.

5
00:00:09,501 --> 00:00:12,005
<i>The finger of guilt...
I think it's a phone number.</i>

6
00:00:12,063 --> 00:00:13,500
<i>Pointed toward Mike...</i>

7
00:00:13,601 --> 00:00:17,300
They tested my wrench and found
traces of this monique's blood.

8
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:19,400
<i>But he still couldn't remember.</i>

9
00:00:19,685 --> 00:00:21,900
<i>Bree found a bag of evidence.</i>

10
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:23,768
- We have to do something.
- Not until

11
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:26,700
we put these back in her house.

12
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:28,725
<i>Orson had a night...</i>

13
00:00:29,301 --> 00:00:31,574
- What do you want?
- A grandchild.

14
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:33,464
<i>That he'd soon rather forget.</i>

15
00:00:33,465 --> 00:00:35,700
You raped my husband.

16
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:38,403
I could be expecting right now.

17
00:00:42,015 --> 00:00:43,385
<i>It had been two months</i>

18
00:00:43,386 --> 00:00:46,400
<i>since Mike Delfino
had awakened from his coma,</i>

19
00:00:46,937 --> 00:00:48,654
<i>And the memories he had lost</i>

20
00:00:48,655 --> 00:00:50,800
<i>were finally starting to return.</i>

21
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,409
<i>He could now recall</i>

22
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,900
<i>the first time
he saw wisteria lane...</i>

23
00:00:59,507 --> 00:01:02,400
<i>and the first time
he met his new neighbors...</i>

24
00:01:05,168 --> 00:01:08,699
<i>and the first time
he heard Susan Mayer laugh.</i>

25
00:01:11,492 --> 00:01:16,045
<i>But the memory he most wanted
to reclaim still eluded him.</i>

26
00:01:16,594 --> 00:01:20,000
<i>That's why he had gone to see
a hypnotherapist,</i>

27
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:23,601
<i>so that he could
finally remember everything.</i>

28
00:01:31,163 --> 00:01:32,995
I thought you'd never get here.

29
00:01:33,748 --> 00:01:36,584
I'm sorry.
The traffic was terrible.

30
00:01:40,627 --> 00:01:42,363
Sorry about that.

31
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:46,389
I called my landlord
when the pipe started leaking,

32
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,100
and he recommended you.

33
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:50,692
I was so flustered, I couldn't
find a piece of paper.

34
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,509
I wrote your number on my hand.

35
00:01:53,145 --> 00:01:56,020
After you finish the sink,
maybe you could help me wash it off.

36
00:01:57,525 --> 00:01:58,628
Look...

37
00:01:59,501 --> 00:02:01,700
I'm flattered,
but I'm seeing somebody.

38
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,359
Me, too...

39
00:02:04,846 --> 00:02:07,026
but he's married, and I'm drunk.

40
00:02:09,844 --> 00:02:13,100
Well, your, uh, s-trap is cracked.

41
00:02:13,744 --> 00:02:15,075
I don't have one with me.

42
00:02:15,076 --> 00:02:17,583
- I'll have to go to a hardware store.
- Now? It's late.

43
00:02:17,584 --> 00:02:19,651
Yeah, well, that water's
just gonna keep seeping,

44
00:02:19,652 --> 00:02:21,426
cause a lot more dame.

45
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:25,600
- I'll, uh, be back in an hour.
- I'll be waiting.

46
00:02:38,115 --> 00:02:39,254
Ms. Polier?

47
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,300
I've, uh... got that part
for the sink.

48
00:02:46,794 --> 00:02:48,048
Hello?

49
00:02:56,982 --> 00:02:58,100
What happened, Mike?

50
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:01,300
- I almost had it. I was so close.
- Close to what?

51
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:03,168
When I went back to monique's place,

52
00:03:03,477 --> 00:03:04,962
Somebody else was there.

53
00:03:05,503 --> 00:03:06,429
Who?

54
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,100
I don't know. I couldn't see it.

55
00:03:08,652 --> 00:03:11,429
<i>Yes, there were still many things</i>

56
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,687
<i>Mike Delfino couldn't remember...</i>

57
00:03:14,287 --> 00:03:15,985
then why are you smiling?

58
00:03:16,825 --> 00:03:18,928
<i>But he'd finally remembered</i>

59
00:03:19,005 --> 00:03:21,224
<i>The most important thing of all.</i>

60
00:03:22,742 --> 00:03:25,500
'Cause now I know I didn't kill her.

"I Remember That"

66
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,721
<i>It was 6:00 in the morning,</i>

67
00:04:13,284 --> 00:04:15,907
<i>and Bree Hodge was faced with a dilemma</i>

68
00:04:15,978 --> 00:04:18,669
<i>Familiar to countless housewives.</i>

69
00:04:19,397 --> 00:04:22,601
<i>Should she wake her husband
to discuss recent events</i>

70
00:04:22,602 --> 00:04:24,939
<i>That were weighing heavily
on her mind?</i>

71
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,046
<i>Or should she left him continue
to get the rest he needed?</i>

72
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,800
<i>Bree made the obvious choice.</i>

73
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:38,522
I'm sorry, but you've been
out cold for ten hours,

74
00:04:38,523 --> 00:04:40,002
and we need to talk.

75
00:04:42,859 --> 00:04:44,480
I remember drinking the scotch

76
00:04:45,055 --> 00:04:47,228
and then Alma suddenly sitting up.

77
00:04:47,486 --> 00:04:49,350
But after that, nothing.

78
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:52,999
Oh, dear. I'm not sure
how to tell you this, but...

79
00:04:53,562 --> 00:04:57,425
after Alma knocked you out,
she assaulted you.

80
00:04:59,114 --> 00:05:00,143
Where?

81
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,329
Sexually.

82
00:05:02,255 --> 00:05:04,582
- She had sex with you.
- Oh, that's impossible.

83
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:06,414
Your drink was laced
with pills for...

84
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:09,084
erectile dysfunction.

85
00:05:09,566 --> 00:05:11,100
But I was dead to the world.

86
00:05:11,431 --> 00:05:13,400
No, dear,
you were dead to the waist.

87
00:05:13,859 --> 00:05:16,442
I had sex with Alma,
and I wasn't even conscious?

88
00:05:18,395 --> 00:05:19,700
How reminiscent of our marriage.

89
00:05:20,155 --> 00:05:21,693
Okay, this is no joke.

90
00:05:22,778 --> 00:05:24,893
She raped you,
and your mother helped.

91
00:05:25,647 --> 00:05:27,904
Look, after we get dressed,
we're going to the police.

92
00:05:27,905 --> 00:05:28,836
I can't do that.

93
00:05:28,941 --> 00:05:31,600
Orson, I know you're embarrassed,

94
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,391
but what they did to you was a crime.

95
00:05:34,392 --> 00:05:37,855
No, I can't go to the police.
Not now, not ever.

96
00:05:38,008 --> 00:05:40,764
Orson, your ex-wife
is a homicidal rapist,

97
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:43,400
and your mother is
straight out of "I, claudius."

98
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:45,361
Why do you refuse to deal withhem?

99
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:52,772
I think it's time I told you

100
00:05:52,773 --> 00:05:55,132
about the night Monique polier died.

101
00:06:04,232 --> 00:06:05,507
What do you think of this one?

102
00:06:06,183 --> 00:06:08,415
Pretty sexy. Is sexy
what you're going for

103
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,118
at the funeral of your boyfriend's wife?

104
00:06:10,705 --> 00:06:12,015
You're right. I'll keep looking.

105
00:06:12,802 --> 00:06:15,031
Why are you even going?
Won't it be weird?

106
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,445
No, it'll be fine. Ian wants me there.

107
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:20,311
Yeah, but it'll be all of
Jane's friends and family, and

108
00:06:20,493 --> 00:06:22,692
you'll be the other woman
who swooped in like some--

109
00:06:22,693 --> 00:06:24,200
Okay, yes, it'll be weird.

110
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,595
But it's not about me.
This is about Jane and Ian.

111
00:06:29,544 --> 00:06:30,691
What if I wore this one?

112
00:06:31,736 --> 00:06:34,241
Then it'll be about
Jane, Ian and your boobs.

113
00:06:35,545 --> 00:06:37,547
I have got to get
more depressing clothes.

114
00:06:38,235 --> 00:06:40,976
Okay, I just need to keep a low profile

115
00:06:40,977 --> 00:06:43,703
through the memorial,
'cause once I get through this,

116
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,988
Ian can officially introduce me
as his girlfriend,

117
00:06:47,305 --> 00:06:50,041
and we'll finally be a normal,
non-Adulterous couple.

118
00:06:51,506 --> 00:06:52,825
What does this one say to you?

119
00:06:53,564 --> 00:06:54,493
Modest, reserved

120
00:06:54,494 --> 00:06:57,018
and definitely not dating
the dead lady's husband.

121
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,600
Sold.

122
00:07:00,222 --> 00:07:02,710
I'm not gonna get you towels
for your birthday.

123
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:04,475
Let's go
to the jewelry department.

124
00:07:04,628 --> 00:07:06,498
No, Zach,
I only accept jewelry

125
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:08,200
from men I plan on sleeping with.

126
00:07:08,483 --> 00:07:11,101
Well, okay,
so where does that leave me?

127
00:07:12,613 --> 00:07:14,885
You can buy me that toilet seat cover.

128
00:07:15,542 --> 00:07:17,917
Um, fine. All right,
all right, we're just friends.

129
00:07:18,128 --> 00:07:20,600
Can I at least take you out
for a birthday dinner?

130
00:07:20,794 --> 00:07:23,964
There will be no celebration.
I'm turning 31.

131
00:07:24,222 --> 00:07:26,226
I'm a single woman in her 30s.

132
00:07:26,482 --> 00:07:29,800
I now have to subscribe
to "cat fancy." It's the law.

133
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:32,672
Age is just a number.
It doesn't mean anything.

134
00:07:32,763 --> 00:07:34,100
<i>It means something to me.</i>

135
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,425
Being alone at this age--
It's hard,

136
00:07:37,545 --> 00:07:38,960
And it's only gonna get harder.

137
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,905
I'm so depressed.

138
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,155
Let me buy you a car.

139
00:07:43,636 --> 00:07:45,400
No, thanks.

140
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,600
But I do need a, uh,
liquid soap dispenser.

141
00:07:50,477 --> 00:07:51,463
Go.

142
00:08:09,574 --> 00:08:10,600
Hello.

143
00:08:13,013 --> 00:08:15,110
Oh, sorry.
Didn't mean to disturb you.

144
00:08:15,502 --> 00:08:17,192
I was just trying to see
whether or not

145
00:08:17,193 --> 00:08:19,300
This was a regular king
or a california king.

146
00:08:19,678 --> 00:08:21,300
Well, I think it's a regular.

147
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,390
California kings are much longer.

148
00:08:24,376 --> 00:08:27,693
Is your... wife particularly tall?

149
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:29,800
Oh, I'm, uh, I'm not married.

150
00:08:30,388 --> 00:08:32,513
Oh. Well, why don't you try it out?

151
00:08:33,534 --> 00:08:35,295
That's okay.
I can wait till you get off.

152
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:39,053
Oh, that'll happen a lot faster
if you just hop on board.

153
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:41,402
I'm sorry?

154
00:08:42,109 --> 00:08:44,108
It was a... shameless sex joke.

155
00:08:44,695 --> 00:08:46,384
I was flirting with you.

156
00:08:47,062 --> 00:08:48,538
Oh! Right!

157
00:08:49,852 --> 00:08:51,157
Sorry, I can be a little dense.

158
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:53,801
Can we start over?

159
00:08:53,802 --> 00:08:55,985
No. Moment's gone. You killed it.

160
00:08:56,946 --> 00:08:58,813
Uh, look, you know,
I'm in a bit of a hurry,

161
00:08:58,814 --> 00:09:01,302
but maybe we can, uh,
try this again sometime.

162
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:04,669
It could happen.

163
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:06,578
Hey, sorry I took so long.

164
00:09:07,777 --> 00:09:08,776
Mr. Young?

165
00:09:08,928 --> 00:09:11,400
Oh. You know my friend... Zach?

166
00:09:12,814 --> 00:09:14,365
No, I don't think so.

167
00:09:14,366 --> 00:09:16,472
I'm Luke... Purdue?

168
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:17,810
I'm on your legal team.

169
00:09:17,811 --> 00:09:19,383
I'm taking point on Talverson deal.

170
00:09:19,483 --> 00:09:20,539
Yeah, right. Hey.

171
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:25,248
Again, it was nice meeting you.

172
00:09:26,861 --> 00:09:27,882
Sir.

173
00:09:30,114 --> 00:09:31,197
That was really weird.

174
00:09:31,496 --> 00:09:33,520
I don't even know the guy,
and he works for me.

175
00:09:36,216 --> 00:09:37,825
Works for me, too.

176
00:09:42,822 --> 00:09:43,338
Bree--

177
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:44,832
Please don't touch me.

178
00:09:46,722 --> 00:09:48,844
All this time, you've said
you wanted the truth.

179
00:09:49,103 --> 00:09:50,523
That's before I knew what it was.

180
00:09:51,307 --> 00:09:54,035
You see, that's why I've tried
to protect you from this.

181
00:09:54,352 --> 00:09:57,170
Yeah, but you weren't just
trying to protect me, were you?

182
00:09:59,788 --> 00:10:00,981
What do you want me to do?

183
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:02,846
Exonerate Mike.

184
00:10:03,794 --> 00:10:06,231
How could you stand by
and let an innocent man

185
00:10:06,232 --> 00:10:08,934
- be dragged off to prison?
- You think I haven't felt terrible?

186
00:10:09,004 --> 00:10:10,739
And this, after he'd been in a coma

187
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,923
because some lunatic ran him over.

188
00:10:14,433 --> 00:10:15,537
He has had a rough year.

189
00:10:16,386 --> 00:10:17,430
I wanna help Mike.

190
00:10:17,845 --> 00:10:20,370
How do I do that
without implicating myself?

191
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:21,499
I could go to jail.

192
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,447
I don't care if you go to jail.

193
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:26,594
You have done a horrible thing,
and you have to make it right.

194
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:29,600
I mean it, Orson.

195
00:10:30,578 --> 00:10:32,700
If you don't fix this, I will.

196
00:10:34,448 --> 00:10:36,974
Well, I guess
I'm in no position to argue.

197
00:10:37,984 --> 00:10:39,200
No, you're not.

198
00:10:44,984 --> 00:10:46,868
- Morning, Andrew.
- Hey, Orson.

199
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,754
I was just gonna ask
if you guys wanted some coffee.

200
00:10:49,859 --> 00:10:52,219
Oh. Yeah. Thanks. I could use some.

201
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:55,145
It's gonna be a long day.

202
00:11:01,004 --> 00:11:02,777
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

203
00:11:03,974 --> 00:11:05,300
Thank you. There you go.

204
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:09,130
Mom!

205
00:11:09,477 --> 00:11:11,738
Dinner is in an hour.
You know the rules.

206
00:11:12,636 --> 00:11:13,659
And so do you.

207
00:11:13,736 --> 00:11:16,754
I know, I know,
but he gave me the face.

208
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:19,509
You fell for the face.
What are you, a rookie?

209
00:11:19,683 --> 00:11:21,351
Okay, you're right.

210
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,200
Sorry, buddy. Mom's the boss.

211
00:11:26,174 --> 00:11:27,178
I feel nothing.

212
00:11:31,615 --> 00:11:33,390
Hi, Lynette. Hey, tom.

213
00:11:34,275 --> 00:11:36,750
How's the restaurant going?
You ready for the big opening?

214
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:39,500
Oh, we're getting there.
Let me give you a coupon.

215
00:11:39,635 --> 00:11:42,837
Free extra topping
on any medium or large.

216
00:11:42,914 --> 00:11:44,374
Well, how nice.

217
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,353
But you know
what would be even nicer?

218
00:11:46,825 --> 00:11:48,330
Hire my nephew to work for you.

219
00:11:50,112 --> 00:11:51,735
You know,
the coupon's good all week.

220
00:11:51,832 --> 00:11:54,142
Look, I don't know what lies
you've heard about austin,

221
00:11:54,143 --> 00:11:56,377
But you can't be listening
to vicious gossip.

222
00:11:56,763 --> 00:11:59,005
I heard he got arrested
for beating some guy up.

223
00:11:59,526 --> 00:12:00,885
Okay, that one's pretty accurate.

224
00:12:00,943 --> 00:12:02,808
Edie, I'm all staffed up.

225
00:12:03,302 --> 00:12:05,224
Oh, come on! Help me out.

226
00:12:05,398 --> 00:12:07,638
Seriously, ever since julie dumped him,

227
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:09,857
He's been depressed and mopey.
He's driving me crazy.

228
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:12,153
Please, any crappy job you got.

229
00:12:15,045 --> 00:12:17,267
Well, I guess I could use
an extra guy in back.

230
00:12:17,268 --> 00:12:19,474
Have him there tomorrow,
8:00 in the morning.

231
00:12:19,763 --> 00:12:22,667
Thank you. Thank you so, so much.

232
00:12:22,898 --> 00:12:25,476
uh, Edie, you forgot your coupon.

233
00:12:25,758 --> 00:12:26,600
Oh, tom, please,

234
00:12:26,601 --> 00:12:28,388
You've checked out my butt
enough times

235
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:29,739
to know that I d't eat pizza.

236
00:12:42,422 --> 00:12:43,310
- Zach!
- I know.

237
00:12:43,311 --> 00:12:45,625
you said you wanted
to be alone for your birthday, but

238
00:12:46,281 --> 00:12:48,300
that's just dumb,
so I'm gonna take you out.

239
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,700
- Oh, that's so sweet, but I--
- Don't worry.

240
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:53,300
It's just gonna be one friend
keeping another friend company.

241
00:12:53,303 --> 00:12:54,364
It's not gonna be a date.

242
00:12:54,617 --> 00:12:57,258
Well, Luke's gonna be
here in 20 minutes,

243
00:12:57,259 --> 00:12:59,100
and that kind of will be a date.

244
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,082
Luke?

245
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,300
That's, uh... my lawyer guy?

246
00:13:03,632 --> 00:13:06,812
Yeah. That isn't a problem, is it?

247
00:13:07,102 --> 00:13:08,386
'Cause this is what friends do.

248
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,097
They talk about each other's dates.

249
00:13:11,235 --> 00:13:12,455
No, I-I'm cool.

250
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,554
Have a great time.

251
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,440
Uh, I'm gonna get out of your hair.

252
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,494
So you think
this guy's really into you?

253
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,693
Well, he seemed to like me
in the mattress department,

254
00:13:26,694 --> 00:13:29,387
So here's hoping I like him
the mattress department.

255
00:13:33,048 --> 00:13:35,556
What? Friends say these things.

256
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,621
Orson.

257
00:13:41,642 --> 00:13:43,958
Oh, well, I'm in luck.

258
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,303
The whole coven's here.

259
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:50,251
I just stopped by to say thank you.

260
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:52,696
Mm... you're welcome.

261
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,570
I bought a pregnancy test,
but it's too soon to take it.

262
00:13:56,647 --> 00:13:58,441
I wasn't talking about the sex.

263
00:13:58,595 --> 00:14:01,607
Though hats off, mother,
for colluding in my rape.

264
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,658
I think it's great that we can
still surprise each other.

265
00:14:05,498 --> 00:14:08,013
No, I was talking more about
what you did for me and Bree.

266
00:14:08,263 --> 00:14:09,382
What did I do?

267
00:14:09,633 --> 00:14:11,472
Your little stunt made her so angry,

268
00:14:11,473 --> 00:14:13,444
She demanded we go  the police.

269
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,652
She forced my hand,

270
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:18,632
So I told her everything.

271
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,962
Everything?

272
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,139
That is rather unwise.

273
00:14:23,274 --> 00:14:25,261
I faced my worst fear--

274
00:14:25,418 --> 00:14:27,447
I moment I felt sure
would end my marriage,

275
00:14:27,448 --> 00:14:28,576
And guess what?

276
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:30,654
It didn't.

277
00:14:31,754 --> 00:14:33,075
She forgave you?

278
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:35,936
Not entirely. Not yet.

279
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:37,747
But she'll come around.

280
00:14:38,634 --> 00:14:40,185
The good news is,

281
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:43,157
The months of dread,
the fear of discovery...

282
00:14:43,948 --> 00:14:44,934
that's all over.

283
00:14:46,124 --> 00:14:47,282
So thank you...

284
00:14:48,945 --> 00:14:50,141
and good-Bye.

285
00:14:54,431 --> 00:14:55,417
Wait!

286
00:14:55,533 --> 00:14:57,436
I could be carrying your child!

287
00:14:58,323 --> 00:15:01,381
I don't care if you've got
the Hodge septuplets in there.

288
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,701
I'm sticking with Bree.

289
00:15:10,569 --> 00:15:14,466
Why must he make
everything so difficult?

290
00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:20,300
Oh, uh, floor's done.

291
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,379
I told you I wanted this floor
to sparkle like your mom's.

292
00:15:25,514 --> 00:15:28,671
Now does this floor look
"Bree Hodge" clean to you?

293
00:15:28,786 --> 00:15:32,564
Uh... no. It looks
"Andrew Van De Kamp" clean.

294
00:15:33,047 --> 00:15:35,784
But your disappointment in me
is very Bree Hodge.

295
00:15:36,247 --> 00:15:39,321
Okay, just for that, you get
to help me take out the trash.

296
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:43,563
I know youhink
I'm being a hard-ass,

297
00:15:43,756 --> 00:15:44,783
But I'm just looking

298
00:15:44,784 --> 00:15:47,850
for a basic level
of professionalism that...

299
00:15:51,764 --> 00:15:54,552
Austin? What the hell's going on here?

300
00:15:54,776 --> 00:15:57,342
Just, uh, just talking
to the delivery guy.

301
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,186
Hey, where'd he go?

302
00:16:01,286 --> 00:16:02,440
Are you high?

303
00:16:03,154 --> 00:16:04,194
Only...

304
00:16:06,526 --> 00:16:08,241
totally.

305
00:16:08,454 --> 00:16:09,455
Austin!

306
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:11,018
Dude, not smart.

307
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,796
But I have good reason,
and when you hear it,

308
00:16:13,988 --> 00:16:16,747
You're not gonna make
that face anymore.

309
00:16:18,714 --> 00:16:21,800
Julie Mayer dumped me,
and I'm very...

310
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:24,753
very upset.

311
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,927
Your face is not changing.

312
00:16:29,815 --> 00:16:32,033
Get your stuff. Get the hell
out of my restaurant.

313
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:33,673
You're fired. Go on.

314
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,635
Floor's looking pretty clean
right now, isn't it?

315
00:16:49,201 --> 00:16:50,624
You said he'd come back to me.

316
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,818
You said deep down, he still loves me.

317
00:16:52,876 --> 00:16:54,574
Well, you heard him today.
He hates me!

318
00:16:54,952 --> 00:16:57,171
You ravished him against his will.

319
00:16:57,531 --> 00:16:59,800
He's bound to be touchy
in the short run.

320
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:02,818
I'll handle Orson.
You just worry about the baby.

321
00:17:03,031 --> 00:17:04,375
He said he doesn't care.

322
00:17:04,626 --> 00:17:06,157
He says that now,

323
00:17:06,562 --> 00:17:09,467
But he will not abandon
his own flesh and blood.

324
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,597
You're his flesh and blood.
He put you in a home.

325
00:17:14,813 --> 00:17:18,422
You know, I usually don't
say this to expectant mothers,

326
00:17:18,423 --> 00:17:20,969
But for God sake, have a scotch.

327
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:26,745
I should just call the police.

328
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,474
What?

329
00:17:29,647 --> 00:17:30,716
I know what he did.

330
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:33,409
If he's never gonna love me,
why should I protect him?

331
00:17:33,949 --> 00:17:35,288
I'd rather see him in jail

332
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:37,116
than playing house with tammy tightass.

333
00:17:37,117 --> 00:17:38,891
Knock it off, Alma.

334
00:17:40,048 --> 00:17:42,462
I will make Orson come around.

335
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,526
I don't believe you anymore.

336
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:48,433
She's got her claws in him,
and she's not letting go.

337
00:17:49,013 --> 00:17:50,614
Don't be so sure.

338
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:54,147
I was looking over
at their house last night,

339
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:58,050
and I saw something very...

340
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:00,197
curious.

341
00:18:01,084 --> 00:18:02,099
What?

342
00:18:03,314 --> 00:18:05,200
You can't see it down here.

343
00:18:07,157 --> 00:18:10,090
We need to be up higher.

344
00:18:21,455 --> 00:18:23,044
How can you
see anything from here?

345
00:18:23,045 --> 00:18:24,433
There's not even a window.

346
00:18:27,491 --> 00:18:28,500
Gloria?

347
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,183
Gloria?!

348
00:18:33,122 --> 00:18:35,870
Just calm down, sweetheart.

349
00:18:36,044 --> 00:18:37,273
Gloria, let me out!

350
00:18:37,274 --> 00:18:38,960
Stress isn't good for the baby.

351
00:18:38,961 --> 00:18:40,889
What are you doing?! Hey!

352
00:18:41,741 --> 00:18:42,800
Gloria?!

353
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:04,000
So how are you holding up?

354
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,678
Better, now that you're here.

355
00:19:06,591 --> 00:19:09,427
Oh! No, I wanna, um,
keep a low profile.

356
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:11,236
But I've kissed a hundred lips today.

357
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,213
I assure you, it would look
more conspicuous if I didn't.

358
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,431
Okay, that's enough.

359
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:29,750
Ian, oh, you must be shattered.

360
00:19:29,901 --> 00:19:32,162
- I know I am.
- Thanks for coming, Lynn.

361
00:19:32,202 --> 00:19:32,689
Oh.

362
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,600
You know,
Jane used to kid me about you.

363
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:41,300
Huh. Did she?

364
00:19:41,401 --> 00:19:44,449
She'd say, "lynn,
if anything ever happens to me,

365
00:19:44,621 --> 00:19:46,529
I want you to marry Ian."

366
00:19:47,635 --> 00:19:49,096
"You're pushy.

367
00:19:49,192 --> 00:19:51,777
Maybe you can get him
to pick up his socks."

368
00:19:54,457 --> 00:19:57,200
Listen, um,
if you ever need to talk,

369
00:19:57,603 --> 00:19:58,865
I'm here.

370
00:19:59,444 --> 00:20:01,950
Why don't you
stop over some night

371
00:20:02,085 --> 00:20:03,629
for a home-Cooked meal?

372
00:20:04,957 --> 00:20:06,520
Oh, that's very kind of you.

373
00:20:06,617 --> 00:20:09,058
But I... I wouldn't dream
of putting you out.

374
00:20:09,797 --> 00:20:12,787
Well, I won't take "no"
for an answer.

375
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,200
Have you got my number?

376
00:20:15,261 --> 00:20:16,800
I sure as hell do.

377
00:20:17,211 --> 00:20:19,777
Well, I... I'm sure I'll find it
in Jane's phone book.

378
00:20:20,201 --> 00:20:22,979
Let me give it to you,
just in case.

379
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,163
Call anytime.

380
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,427
Oops. Watch yourself.

381
00:20:41,459 --> 00:20:43,061
So I was there
on a plumbing job.

382
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:44,498
It makes complete sense.

383
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,400
I had no reason
to want her dead.

384
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:48,300
Huh. I always thought
hypnotherapy

385
00:20:48,401 --> 00:20:50,177
was a bunch of bull,
but damn.

386
00:20:51,201 --> 00:20:54,153
This is huge, man.
You didn't kill anyone.

387
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:57,000
The murderer has to be
this yellow gloves guy.

388
00:20:57,258 --> 00:20:59,033
Yeah, but no matter
how much I concentrate,

389
00:20:59,149 --> 00:21:02,178
I still can't see a face.
- Ah, you will.

390
00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:04,742
Look at the progress
that you've made so far.

391
00:21:05,217 --> 00:21:06,587
You're gonna find this guy

392
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:08,921
and then you're gonna
hand his ass over to the cops.

393
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:12,400
Yeah...
something like that.

394
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:15,641
Hey, guys.

395
00:21:25,252 --> 00:21:27,104
Well, Ian seems to be
holding up.

396
00:21:27,606 --> 00:21:30,500
Mm, it's just a mask.
The man is devastated.

397
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:34,100
Tomorrow night,
I'm gonna swing by his place

398
00:21:34,201 --> 00:21:37,300
to offer him a casserole
and a shoulder to cry on.

399
00:21:37,674 --> 00:21:39,931
Will that shoulder be
wearing a spaghetti strap

400
00:21:40,124 --> 00:21:41,464
and Chanel n°5?

401
00:21:41,754 --> 00:21:43,754
You know me so well.

402
00:21:44,352 --> 00:21:45,963
Oh, look at him.

403
00:21:46,118 --> 00:21:49,034
Even in mourning,
the man is scrumptious.

404
00:21:51,181 --> 00:21:53,497
I'm sorry for eavesdropping,
but don't you think

405
00:21:53,554 --> 00:21:56,063
your conversation
is a little inappropriate?

406
00:21:56,372 --> 00:21:59,585
I mean, we're here to grieve,
not cruise.

407
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,405
I'm sorry, and you are...

408
00:22:03,466 --> 00:22:04,893
Susan Mayer.

409
00:22:05,202 --> 00:22:07,937
I'm...
a friend of the family.

410
00:22:10,627 --> 00:22:13,714
Then... you know how lonely
Ian's been.

411
00:22:13,984 --> 00:22:16,165
And if I wanna
do something about that

412
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:18,778
it's no business of yours.

413
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:24,759
Look, just to save you
the embarrassment,

414
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:27,295
Ian's seeing someone.

415
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:29,794
Who?

416
00:22:31,501 --> 00:22:32,999
I'm not at liberty to say.

417
00:22:33,087 --> 00:22:36,039
Under the circumstances,
they'd prefer to keep it quiet.

418
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:39,041
I don't believe it. If there was
some bimbo in the picture,

419
00:22:39,196 --> 00:22:40,337
I'd have heard about it.

420
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:43,521
As far as I'm concerned,
he's free meat.

421
00:22:45,774 --> 00:22:46,835
Okay, it's me.

422
00:22:47,538 --> 00:22:48,155
What?

423
00:22:48,464 --> 00:22:50,316
I'm the bimbo. He's my meat.

424
00:22:54,908 --> 00:22:55,834
All right.

425
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:58,221
I just wanted
to clear that up.

426
00:22:59,707 --> 00:23:01,559
And now I'm going to go

427
00:23:01,636 --> 00:23:04,000
find myself a seat
with a... better view.

428
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,054
Here are your w-4s.

429
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:12,178
Please sign them and get them
back to me as soon as possible.

430
00:23:12,271 --> 00:23:16,875
Also, I'm gonna need a copy...
Hi... of your driver's license.

431
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:18,434
Austin?

432
00:23:18,674 --> 00:23:19,273
Yeah?

433
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,492
What are you doing here?
I fired you.

434
00:23:22,295 --> 00:23:24,977
Well... Mr Scavo gave me
my job back.

435
00:23:25,942 --> 00:23:26,752
Hey!

436
00:23:28,694 --> 00:23:30,237
You hired him back?

437
00:23:30,314 --> 00:23:32,822
Did he tell you he was stoned
on the job?

438
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:35,884
Yeah... and he knows if he does again,
he's outta here.

439
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:38,326
Look, I don't know what kind
of hustle you pulled on him

440
00:23:38,372 --> 00:23:40,147
- But it's not gonna work on me.
- Lynette.

441
00:23:40,225 --> 00:23:43,627
No, I fired him,
and you are gonna stay fired.

442
00:23:43,723 --> 00:23:46,366
Honey, can I see you
in the back for a sec?

443
00:23:52,248 --> 00:23:53,377
What the hell are you doing,

444
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:55,221
Talking to me like that
in front of my staff?

445
00:23:55,222 --> 00:23:58,022
Well, I'm sorry, but you totally
blindsided me out there.

446
00:23:58,099 --> 00:23:59,843
No, I was the one
who was blindsided.

447
00:23:59,844 --> 00:24:02,531
You just went off on me without even
hearing what my reasons were.

448
00:24:02,532 --> 00:24:03,684
I'm sorry. Let's hear them.

449
00:24:03,781 --> 00:24:06,037
What are your reasons
for bringing back Joe bong hit?

450
00:24:06,115 --> 00:24:09,971
I'd tell you, if you drop that
tone and stop making that face.

451
00:24:10,569 --> 00:24:11,979
What is...

452
00:24:12,304 --> 00:24:14,291
This was a business decision.

453
00:24:14,387 --> 00:24:15,467
In case you hadn't noticed

454
00:24:15,526 --> 00:24:17,918
I hadn't until the waitresses
pointed it out to me...

455
00:24:18,034 --> 00:24:19,472
Austin is hot.

456
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:21,539
He's gonna bring in
every girl from fairview high

457
00:24:21,595 --> 00:24:23,537
And half the boys in the chorus.
- Okay...

458
00:24:23,627 --> 00:24:25,885
What's more, Edie is gonna
include our menu

459
00:24:25,981 --> 00:24:28,394
in the welcome packet
she gives to new homeowners.

460
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,338
I'm not sure
she'd feel so generous

461
00:24:30,395 --> 00:24:31,656
if we fired her nephew.

462
00:24:34,228 --> 00:24:35,752
Those reasons working for ya?

463
00:24:35,785 --> 00:24:40,013
Yeah. I just wish you'd told me
before you rehired him.

464
00:24:40,052 --> 00:24:42,179
I mean... I am the manager.

465
00:24:42,386 --> 00:24:43,331
Right...

466
00:24:45,164 --> 00:24:46,500
but I'm the boss.

467
00:24:47,634 --> 00:24:48,830
Well, kinda.

468
00:24:49,294 --> 00:24:51,686
No, no. Not "kind of."

469
00:24:51,956 --> 00:24:52,749
Really.

470
00:24:53,521 --> 00:24:54,700
I'm the boss.

471
00:24:56,588 --> 00:24:58,039
You pulling rank on me?

472
00:24:58,174 --> 00:25:01,137
Look, at home,
you get to be in charge

473
00:25:01,195 --> 00:25:03,271
and you decide
how we discipline the boys

474
00:25:03,329 --> 00:25:04,989
What car we buy, everything.

475
00:25:05,085 --> 00:25:06,590
- I consult you.
- Oh sure !

476
00:25:06,648 --> 00:25:08,726
And if you disagree...
you ignore me !

477
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:10,107
Look, when I go home,

478
00:25:10,203 --> 00:25:12,787
basically,
I check my balls at the door

479
00:25:12,902 --> 00:25:14,559
and that's fine. It works.

480
00:25:14,694 --> 00:25:17,749
But for this to work,
when you walk through that door

481
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:20,142
You gotta check yours.

482
00:25:25,265 --> 00:25:25,869
Okay.

483
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:28,898
Really?

484
00:25:29,785 --> 00:25:30,867
Really.

485
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:33,700
This place is your dream, so...

486
00:25:34,724 --> 00:25:36,325
consider them checked.

487
00:25:36,846 --> 00:25:39,902
Thanks. Now I need you
to do just one more thing.

488
00:25:40,616 --> 00:25:41,857
Whatever you say...

489
00:25:42,146 --> 00:25:42,994
... boss.

490
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:46,371
I don't care if you think
you know what's best!

491
00:25:46,526 --> 00:25:48,025
You don't! I do,

492
00:25:48,121 --> 00:25:50,457
Because I'm the boss,
and what I say goes.

493
00:25:50,688 --> 00:25:51,977
Yeah, that's it.
Give it to me.

494
00:25:51,985 --> 00:25:54,281
So when I make a decision,
it stays made!

495
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,182
- You got that, Lynette?
- Yes, sir.

496
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,303
- Okay, that's enough.
- No, just one more.

497
00:25:58,372 --> 00:26:01,228
And if I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it!

498
00:26:01,918 --> 00:26:05,796
But I probably won't, because
I'm the boss! Are we clear?

499
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,931
Seriously,
stop or I will hurt you.

500
00:26:08,028 --> 00:26:09,729
Okay, I've made my point.

501
00:26:10,481 --> 00:26:12,549
Anybody needs me,
I'll be in the back...

502
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:13,900
...drinking a beer.

503
00:26:27,301 --> 00:26:30,205
Mmm. This is delicious.

504
00:26:30,401 --> 00:26:31,900
Don't get too full.

505
00:26:32,001 --> 00:26:34,500
You have to leave room
for dessert.

506
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:36,600
Oh? What are we having?

507
00:26:36,701 --> 00:26:39,277
Well, let's just say
it's going to be served upstairs

508
00:26:39,357 --> 00:26:41,171
and involves whipped cream.

509
00:26:42,231 --> 00:26:43,909
It is pudding?

510
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:44,868
No.

511
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:47,604
- Oh! You're flirting.
- Yeah.

512
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,760
Okay. Do it again.
I swear I'll get it.

513
00:26:49,856 --> 00:26:51,849
It's okay.
Do you want some coffee?

514
00:26:51,984 --> 00:26:56,325
You bet I want coffee...
nice and hot and...

515
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:59,535
Just finish your soup
and we'll get naked.

516
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,696
Sorry to bother you,
Mrs. Solis.

517
00:27:07,754 --> 00:27:09,983
I work with luke.
Is he available?

518
00:27:10,512 --> 00:27:13,155
Charles?
What are you doing here?

519
00:27:13,348 --> 00:27:15,767
You forgot to initial some pages
on the Halverson contract.

520
00:27:15,805 --> 00:27:17,172
Can't this wait?

521
00:27:17,247 --> 00:27:19,398
The market's alrea open
in tokyo.

522
00:27:20,093 --> 00:27:22,908
Uh, go ahead.
I'm gonna open some more wine.

523
00:27:35,398 --> 00:27:38,300
Mr. Young wants to make sure
you understand that last part.

524
00:27:38,996 --> 00:27:40,095
Do you?

525
00:27:49,281 --> 00:27:50,246
Yeah.

526
00:27:51,848 --> 00:27:52,851
I get it.

527
00:27:56,901 --> 00:27:59,176
So when we think of Jane

528
00:27:59,772 --> 00:28:03,200
let us remember her kind heart
and her loving spirit.

529
00:28:03,862 --> 00:28:06,605
And now if there's someone who'd
like to share a special memory

530
00:28:06,682 --> 00:28:08,151
of our dear friend?

531
00:28:08,364 --> 00:28:09,202
I would.

532
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:19,500
Hi. I'm Lynn Dean.

533
00:28:19,778 --> 00:28:22,100
Jane and I were sorority sisters.

534
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:25,600
If she were here, she'd make me
sing our pledge song,

535
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:30,053
But I think there's already been
enough grief for one day.

536
00:28:31,101 --> 00:28:35,827
Now, I know how badly
we've all felt for Ian

537
00:28:36,311 --> 00:28:39,500
during his long, lonely vigil.

538
00:28:40,113 --> 00:28:44,600
So, I'm sure you'll be as happy
as I was to learn

539
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:48,100
his vigil wasn't
quite so lonely after all.

540
00:28:49,226 --> 00:28:50,600
Oh, dear God.

541
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:55,529
No, he found
a warm, caring woman

542
00:28:55,683 --> 00:28:58,098
to share his burden...

543
00:28:59,262 --> 00:29:01,700
and so much else.

544
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:08,740
Some people might find the fact
that she's here today

545
00:29:08,952 --> 00:29:10,400
inappropriate.

546
00:29:10,872 --> 00:29:14,376
But I think she's a hero.

547
00:29:14,723 --> 00:29:21,662
She dared to brave the scorn of
those who might find her actions

548
00:29:21,797 --> 00:29:25,733
questionable or even unsavory.

549
00:29:26,053 --> 00:29:30,300
I was gonna ask her to stand,
but I see she already has.

550
00:29:32,801 --> 00:29:35,800
Susan Mayer, say hello.

551
00:29:38,201 --> 00:29:39,103
Hey.

552
00:29:50,567 --> 00:29:53,374
Guess someone's in a hurry
to get on with the evening.

553
00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:54,629
Yeah.

554
00:29:56,109 --> 00:29:57,800
Well, I should go.

555
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,056
What?

556
00:29:59,152 --> 00:30:02,800
I have a lot more work to do
on that Halverson deal.

557
00:30:03,947 --> 00:30:04,600
Sorry.

558
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,945
But can't it wait
till after dessert?

559
00:30:07,118 --> 00:30:10,600
And by "dessert," I mean sex.
You are clear on that, right?

560
00:30:11,464 --> 00:30:14,031
Painfully,
but my job's at stake here.

561
00:30:14,108 --> 00:30:15,662
I really don't have
much of a choice.

562
00:30:15,843 --> 00:30:18,357
Oh, I think you've got
lots of choices.

563
00:30:18,762 --> 00:30:20,408
Here's one of them.

564
00:30:27,541 --> 00:30:28,300
Hello?

565
00:30:28,401 --> 00:30:30,372
What do you think
you're doing?

566
00:30:30,738 --> 00:30:31,365
What?

567
00:30:31,403 --> 00:30:33,873
I gave you an order,
and I expect you to follow it.

568
00:30:33,988 --> 00:30:36,903
Now get out of there.
Oh, I'm trying, sir.

569
00:30:36,904 --> 00:30:38,509
<i>It's just..
I'm meeting some resistance</i>

570
00:30:38,531 --> 00:30:40,968
<i>to the plan
that we've agreed on.</i>

571
00:30:41,086 --> 00:30:43,411
Okay, she's not letting
you leave? That's fine.

572
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,765
Here's what
I want you to say.

573
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:50,092
Okay, I'll give that
a shot, sir.

574
00:30:50,101 --> 00:30:51,663
Is that your office?

575
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:54,900
Yeah, they, uh, they really
need me over there.

576
00:30:55,001 --> 00:30:58,600
Okay. So come back when
you're done. I'll wait up.

577
00:30:59,189 --> 00:31:01,639
I can't.
No, I really can't.

578
00:31:05,168 --> 00:31:06,789
What is with you?!

579
00:31:06,982 --> 00:31:08,700
An hour ago,
you we really into me,

580
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:10,545
and... and now you can't
get out fast enough.

581
00:31:10,546 --> 00:31:12,032
Okay. Truth?

582
00:31:14,127 --> 00:31:16,191
I thought I could do this,
but I can't.

583
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,732
I'm just not attracted to you.

584
00:31:20,523 --> 00:31:21,800
Of course you are!

585
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,046
No. See...

586
00:31:24,393 --> 00:31:26,500
I really only date
women in their 20s.

587
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:27,692
What?

588
00:31:27,905 --> 00:31:28,946
Sorry.

589
00:31:29,814 --> 00:31:31,146
You're too old for me.

590
00:31:38,626 --> 00:31:41,886
I still got a lot of kick
for an old broad, don't I?

591
00:32:25,676 --> 00:32:26,493
Mom?

592
00:32:28,726 --> 00:32:29,445
Mom?

593
00:32:29,522 --> 00:32:30,920
Mom, are you all right?

594
00:32:30,978 --> 00:32:34,300
Don't move her. She might have
broken something.

595
00:32:36,699 --> 00:32:38,204
Yes, we need
an ambulance, please,

596
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,866
at 4354 Wisteria Lane.

597
00:32:40,982 --> 00:32:43,984
My wife's had a bad fall.
Please hurry.

598
00:32:53,601 --> 00:32:54,745
How is this?

599
00:32:58,321 --> 00:32:59,961
Mrs Hodge was very lucky.

600
00:33:00,154 --> 00:33:01,950
She only suffered
a slight concussion.

601
00:33:02,374 --> 00:33:05,249
If you have any more questions,
the doctor should be back soon.

602
00:33:05,411 --> 00:33:06,614
Thank you.

603
00:33:08,416 --> 00:33:10,982
Thank God.
I was so worried.

604
00:33:11,891 --> 00:33:13,300
Yeah, I'll bet.

605
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,193
What's that supposed to mean?

606
00:33:18,177 --> 00:33:19,922
I heard you two yesterday.

607
00:33:20,171 --> 00:33:23,007
All that stuff
about you maybe going to jail.

608
00:33:23,412 --> 00:33:25,500
Well, that's none of your business.

609
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:29,539
But if you think I had anything
to do with Bree falling...

610
00:33:29,635 --> 00:33:31,082
I'm not stupid.

611
00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:34,227
I know the cops have been all
over you about that dead woman.

612
00:33:34,477 --> 00:33:37,390
And mom said for you
to fix it, or she would.

613
00:33:37,487 --> 00:33:39,337
Is this "accident" how you fixed it?

614
00:33:39,433 --> 00:33:42,055
- All right, you're upset. I get it.
- No, no, you don't get it.

615
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:44,499
There's a reason my mom put me
out on the street last year.

616
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:48,400
You've never met that guy.
You've never met bad Andrew.

617
00:33:48,955 --> 00:33:51,548
But hurt my mom,
and you will.

618
00:33:52,455 --> 00:33:54,307
I love your mother.

619
00:33:54,693 --> 00:33:57,546
I'm gonna do everything I can
to protect her.

620
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,151
Yeah, so am I.

621
00:34:03,726 --> 00:34:07,199
Hi. I'm Bree Hodge's son.
You see that guy right there?

622
00:34:08,086 --> 00:34:09,230
That's her husband.

623
00:34:09,616 --> 00:34:12,394
Do not under any circumstances
let him be alone with her.

624
00:34:12,799 --> 00:34:13,454
Why?

625
00:34:13,647 --> 00:34:15,576
Because it's his fault
that she's in here.

626
00:34:15,883 --> 00:34:17,677
He's a dangerous guy.
Now I've warned you.

627
00:34:17,793 --> 00:34:20,500
If anything happens to her,
you're liable.

628
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,800
Night, dad.

629
00:34:40,697 --> 00:34:41,758
Oh, you're home.

630
00:34:42,434 --> 00:34:44,240
I thought you'd still be out
on your date.

631
00:34:44,413 --> 00:34:46,286
Date's over.
What do you want?

632
00:34:46,441 --> 00:34:49,047
Oh, I... I thought since I can't
take you out for your birthday,

633
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,758
I'd at least
leave you a present.

634
00:34:52,376 --> 00:34:55,400
Don't worry.
It's... It's not expensive.

635
00:34:59,438 --> 00:35:01,502
Aw, Zach!

636
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:05,988
So how'd your date go?

637
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:08,700
Is he crazy?
You're not old.

638
00:35:10,612 --> 00:35:13,486
You did not see the look on his
face when I tried to kiss him.

639
00:35:14,432 --> 00:35:17,100
It's like he was
sniffing expired milk.

640
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:20,531
That's ridiculous.
You're gorgeous.

641
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:23,485
And you're just gonna
get prettier every year.

642
00:35:23,697 --> 00:35:26,100
Aw, that's so sweet...

643
00:35:26,533 --> 00:35:28,018
but it's a lie.

644
00:35:28,674 --> 00:35:31,935
Every tick of the clock
takes away something.

645
00:35:33,759 --> 00:35:36,800
Zach, what am I gonna do
when I'm not pretty anymore?

646
00:35:40,328 --> 00:35:42,100
That's never gonna happen.

647
00:35:44,168 --> 00:35:45,962
I'm gonna
take a little nap, okay?

648
00:35:46,033 --> 00:35:47,400
Just for a minute.

649
00:35:49,789 --> 00:35:52,100
Take as long as you like.

650
00:36:04,772 --> 00:36:08,400
Susan, I've looked everywhere
for you.

651
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:11,448
I didn't think to start with the, um...

652
00:36:11,998 --> 00:36:13,599
embalming room.

653
00:36:14,351 --> 00:36:16,900
Yeah. I'll be having
night terrors from now on...

654
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:20,236
Which I deserve.

655
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,800
Look, no one is judging you.

656
00:36:24,168 --> 00:36:26,714
If anything, they're judging
that dreadful Lynn.

657
00:36:26,927 --> 00:36:29,352
I should be thanking you
for driving her away.

658
00:36:29,564 --> 00:36:32,279
It usually takes a crucifix
and some garlic.

659
00:36:32,646 --> 00:36:35,328
I'm so sorry
I ruined Jane's funeral.

660
00:36:35,521 --> 00:36:37,114
No, you didn't.

661
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:37,944
Yes, I did.

662
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:42,149
It's just...

663
00:36:43,133 --> 00:36:43,847
What?

664
00:36:46,001 --> 00:36:50,200
I thought after we got through
this really... painful day

665
00:36:50,555 --> 00:36:52,831
things would start
to get better.

666
00:36:54,956 --> 00:36:58,602
I thought I could be
more a part of your world.

667
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:02,100
Now all your friends and family
are just gonna think of me

668
00:37:02,192 --> 00:37:04,836
as the crazy lady
from Jane's funeral.

669
00:37:05,318 --> 00:37:07,582
Oh, God. Oh, Ian.

670
00:37:07,736 --> 00:37:09,935
Okay, this is not
supposed to be about me.

671
00:37:10,051 --> 00:37:13,500
You should be upstairs...
saying good-Bye.

672
00:37:15,892 --> 00:37:19,114
I'm just gonna hide out
here with the departed

673
00:37:19,209 --> 00:37:21,370
until everybody leaves.

674
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:23,036
No.

675
00:37:24,761 --> 00:37:25,649
No more hiding.

676
00:37:25,745 --> 00:37:27,998
We have been doing it far too long.

677
00:37:29,518 --> 00:37:31,814
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

678
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:34,560
You helped me through the most
difficult part of my life.

679
00:37:34,607 --> 00:37:37,357
I love you, and I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

680
00:37:37,376 --> 00:37:39,402
I want to marry you.

681
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,277
Ian, are you proposing to me?

682
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:47,853
Well... I guess maybe I... I am.

683
00:37:48,157 --> 00:37:51,800
Whoa, whoa! Um, before you
say another word...

684
00:37:52,286 --> 00:37:54,080
Take a look around.

685
00:37:54,944 --> 00:37:56,600
Ah. Right.

686
00:37:57,957 --> 00:37:59,879
I hadn't really thought a lot
about this moment

687
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,763
But... But when I did, um

688
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:04,853
the table we were at
didn't have a blood gutter.

689
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:07,386
Then may I reopen the subject

690
00:38:07,521 --> 00:38:10,003
at a more opportune time and place?

691
00:38:13,279 --> 00:38:14,171
Yes.

692
00:38:16,802 --> 00:38:21,100
I accept your proposal to propose.

693
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:24,395
Shall we?

694
00:38:33,151 --> 00:38:36,006
Now I want you to dig deep.

695
00:38:36,141 --> 00:38:38,000
If you feel your memory blocked

696
00:38:38,433 --> 00:38:42,041
just count to three,
and the block will melt away.

697
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:47,100
It is natural and easy
for you to recall anything.

698
00:38:47,485 --> 00:38:50,115
Now remember Monique Polier.

699
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:53,400
Remember the night you met her.

700
00:38:56,408 --> 00:38:57,990
Ms. Polier?

701
00:38:59,466 --> 00:39:01,900
I've, uh... got that part for the sink.

702
00:39:04,284 --> 00:39:05,000
Hello?

703
00:39:16,676 --> 00:39:20,226
Sorry. Uh, monique's upstairs
taking a nap.

704
00:39:20,336 --> 00:39:22,300
She wasn't feeling well.

705
00:39:26,962 --> 00:39:29,300
Mike?
Did you see something?

706
00:39:33,854 --> 00:39:34,858
I'm her boyfriend.

707
00:39:34,935 --> 00:39:38,700
I, uh, ahem, figured she'd want
to wake up to a clean kitchen.

708
00:39:40,898 --> 00:39:42,828
Uh, well, I'll just
finish up with the sink

709
00:39:42,924 --> 00:39:44,043
and be out of your hair.

710
00:39:44,819 --> 00:39:47,500
Uh, why don't you let me
take care of the sink?

711
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:50,793
I mean, I'm pretty handy,
and it's getting late.

712
00:39:51,024 --> 00:39:53,000
Oh, I don't mind staying.

713
00:39:53,133 --> 00:39:56,181
No, look, it's okay.
I... I got it under control.

714
00:39:56,678 --> 00:39:57,827
Here.

715
00:39:58,454 --> 00:40:00,653
Well, this should cover
what we owe you.

716
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:08,754
Tell m=Ms. Polier
I hope she feels better.

717
00:40:08,792 --> 00:40:09,583
Will do.

718
00:40:11,849 --> 00:40:12,467
Oh, hey...

719
00:40:14,326 --> 00:40:16,255
Don't forget your wrench.

720
00:40:22,402 --> 00:40:24,600
Mike?
Where are you going?

721
00:40:24,701 --> 00:40:25,800
Mike!

722
00:40:33,243 --> 00:40:35,300
Uh, hey, Mr. Delfino.

723
00:40:35,539 --> 00:40:37,800
I need to, euh,
talk to your stepdad.

724
00:40:37,901 --> 00:40:41,600
Orson's not here. He went
to the hospital with my mom.

725
00:40:42,451 --> 00:40:44,670
She's fine!
Thanks for asking!

726
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,342
Mr Hodge...

727
00:40:53,815 --> 00:40:54,951
Your wife's just sleeping.

728
00:40:55,167 --> 00:40:57,138
I suggest you go home
and do the same.

729
00:40:59,504 --> 00:41:00,633
I will.

730
00:41:02,027 --> 00:41:02,934
You okay?

731
00:41:04,869 --> 00:41:05,969
Yeah.

732
00:41:07,171 --> 00:41:08,252
It's just, uh...

733
00:41:11,197 --> 00:41:13,473
There was a time where
we were all so happy.

734
00:41:14,506 --> 00:41:16,589
I just can't seem to remember
them anymore.

735
00:41:18,157 --> 00:41:21,997
<i>Recapturing the past
is a tricky business.</i>

736
00:41:22,286 --> 00:41:26,252
<i>When most memories are simply
souvenirs of happier time...</i>

737
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,405
Hey, there.

738
00:41:27,907 --> 00:41:29,200
<i>Others...</i>

739
00:41:29,766 --> 00:41:31,580
<i>... can be quite deadly.</i>

740
00:41:32,775 --> 00:41:33,681
Hey, Mike.

741
00:41:34,752 --> 00:41:36,607
What brings you to the hospital?

742
00:41:37,018 --> 00:41:39,618
I've been... seeing a hypnotherapist.

743
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:42,684
She's helping me to fill the gaps
in my memory.

744
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,570
Oh. And how's it going?

745
00:41:47,321 --> 00:41:48,636
It's working.

746
00:42:12,765 --> 00:42:17,106
