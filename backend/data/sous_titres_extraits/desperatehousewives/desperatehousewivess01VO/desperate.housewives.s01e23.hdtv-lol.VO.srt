1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,900
<font color=yellow>Previously on "desperate housewives"...

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,100
<font color=yellow>There is a motive to every mystery...

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,100
Your body isn't responding to 
the medication the way it should.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,700
I think I'm having a heart attack.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,900
<font color=yellow>Evidence of every crime...

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,200
They're charging you with a hate crime?

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,800
I thought you were cheating with him.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,600
With our gay cable guy?

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,700
I didn't know he was gay.

10
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,700
And I didn't know Justin was, either.

11
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,700
<font color=yellow>And an answer to every question.

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,600
Gabby, the woman killed herself.

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,300
Something must have been going on.

14
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,800
<font color=yellow>All you have to do is take a closer look.

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,600
- Had a woman in it.
- A woman?

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,300
She was all chopped up.

17
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,200
<font color=yellow>And eventually, every secret...

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,700
Do you know where Paul Young is?

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,800
I know where he'll be on Thursday night.

20
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,700
<font color=yellow>Will be revealed.

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,100
Mary Alice was being blackmailed?

22
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,700
Oh, Mary Alice, what did you do?

23
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,200
<font color=yellow>My name is Mary Alice young,
and before I died,

24
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:08,500
<font color=yellow>my life was filled with love, laughter, 
friendship, and, sadly... secrets.

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,700
<font color=yellow>The secrets had begun 15 years earlier,
when my name was Angela Forrest,

26
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,500
<font color=yellow>and I was living a life of quiet desperation.

27
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,100
<font color=yellow>I'd feel it every morning 
as I made breakfast for my husband.

28
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,300
If you could stop by the market today,
that would be great.

29
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,800
I'm out of shaving cream.

30
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,400
<font color=yellow>And during the errands 
I ran in the afternoons.

31
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,600
So Friday's double coupon day.

32
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,000
You'll save a bunch if you come on Fridays.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,300
<font color=yellow>Even at my work every evening.

34
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,800
What a lovely calendar.
Was this taken around here?

35
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,000
Oh, no. That's way out in Fairview.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,300
I have family there.
Isn't it idyllic?

37
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,800
Here, Angela. You can file this.

38
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,100
<font color=yellow>To me, each day was gray and meaningless.

39
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,900
<font color=yellow>And then one night,
suddenly...

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,600
Hey, Angela?

41
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,300
<font color=yellow>There was color.

42
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,500
Deirdre. What are you doing here?

43
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,800
I need some money.

44
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,200
Deirdre, here.

45
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,900
You're using again, aren't you?

46
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,200
No, I just, um...

47
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,700
I just got to get some food 
for my baby and some other stuff.

48
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,400
Well, if the baby's hungry,
we can go to the market, and I'll buy food.

49
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,700
I-I can shop for my own baby, okay?

50
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,400
Quiet. I can't think.

51
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,200
See this watch? 
It's worth a lot.

52
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,600
I'll give it to you for 50 bucks.

53
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
She's not giving you money.

54
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
Do you mind?

55
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,700
Angela, you're the only one at rehab
who treated me like a person.

56
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,000
Okay, please, please don't stop now.

57
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,200
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,500
I'll sell you my baby.

59
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,500
What?

60
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,800
I heard you talking,
and I know you can't have your own.

61
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,900
It's been killing you.

62
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,000
I think it's time that you left.

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,100
No, I-I'm thinking about Dana.
You'll give him a good home.

64
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,800
Okay?
He'll be better off.

65
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,500
Okay, shh.
Quiet, quiet.

66
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,300
Honey.

67
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,100
How much money
do you keep in the house?

68
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,800
She has a 10-month-old baby.
Where the hell is it?

69
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,200
I don't know.

70
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,400
If we'd seen a kid, we certainly wouldn't have 
left it sitting in the middle of a crack house.

71
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,700
If anything happens to that
child, I will have your badge.

72
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,600
Just let me do my job, huh?

73
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,500
We'll post an officer at the junkie's bedside.

74
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,100
If she wakes up, we'll let her tell us
where she left her kid.

75
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,700
I really do hope you folks
will be happy here in Fairview.

76
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,500
Thank you.

77
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,800
<font color=yellow>And we were.

78
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,000
Wave bye, Zach.
Wave bye-bye.

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,200
<font color=yellow>We were as happy as any family could be.

80
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,800
<font color=yellow>Until one night... three years later...

81
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,600
<font color=yellow>When there was a knock at our door...

82
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,300
<font color=yellow>and I was desperate once again.

83
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,800
<font color=F93A86>Desperate Housewives

84
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,300
<font color=F62B97>Episode 23 : One Wonderful Day

85
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,800
<font color=yellow>It was 5:00 in the morning on Wisteria Lane
when the phone calls started.

86
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,800
<font color=yellow>Of course, each of them knew something 
was wrong from that first ring.

87
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,800
Hello?

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,400
<font color=yellow>After all, it's one of the unwritten
rules of suburbia...

89
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,000
Hello?

90
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,000
<font color=yellow>Don't call the neighbors in the middle of the night...

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,400
<font color=yellow>Unless the news is bad.

92
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,100
Hello?

93
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:49,100
<font color=yellow>And so they came with their uncombed hair
and their unmade faces.

94
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,700
<font color=yellow>They came because...
after all these years...

95
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,100
Bree.

96
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,900
<font color=yellow>They were no longer just neighbors.

97
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,500
What are you doing here?

98
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,000
We heard Rex had a heart attack.
How is he?

99
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,400
Um... he's stable,

100
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,800
but,  um, they have to put in a pacemaker,
so they're going to need to operate.

101
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
How did you guys know?

102
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,000
Danielle called.

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,300
So how are you doing?

104
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,900
We were having a fight
when he had the heart attack,

105
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,000
and I'm just feeling really guilty,
because I should have gotten him here sooner --

106
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,800
Honey, the doctors here are great.

107
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,600
Yeah, and he's so young,
he's going to bounce right back.

108
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,400
I'm sure you have nothing to worry about.

109
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,100
You know what?

110
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,100
I  am so happy that you guys came here,
I really am,

111
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,800
but I am trying really hard to be strong,
so if you keep comforting me...

112
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,500
- You're going to lose it?
- Mm-hmm.

113
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,200
Then we won't comfort.

114
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,400
Thank you.

115
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,100
We're just going to 
talk about non-crisis things.

116
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,000
Oh, I know.

117
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,100
Uh... I found Mrs. Huber's journal
in some of Mike's stuff,

118
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,800
and I think she knew Mary Alice's secret
and was blackmailing her.

119
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,900
Yep, that'll do it.

120
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,300
Zachary! 
Come back here, please.

121
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,300
Your father told you
he would be gone for a while.

122
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,900
He said you should
let me look after you.

123
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,800
I will be fine by myself.
I am not a child.

124
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,000
I know you're not a child,
but I think we should discuss this.

125
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,700
I'm fine, really.

126
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,800
Why should you fend for yourself
when you can just come home with me?

127
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,300
Let me shoulder the burden.

128
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,700
It would really be my pleasure --

129
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,700
Stop! What kind of freak are you?

130
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,100
Just leave me alone, all right?
You are not my mother!

131
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,200
I told you that I am fine.

132
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,500
Now stop acting like my mother
and go home.

133
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,700
I wish it were that easy,
Zachary, for your sake,

134
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,800
but it's not.

135
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,300
Your father's not coming back.

136
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,100
He said that he was.

137
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,100
He lied.

138
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,100
I wanted to spare you this, but...

139
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,100
your father and I discussed it, and...

140
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,100
he decided that he shouldn't come back.

141
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,500
Now, get your bag,
and let's go home.

142
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,300
I'm going to make you some pudding.

143
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,300
What did you do to my dad?

144
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,000
Aah!

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,700
Tell me!

146
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,600
Mrs. Applewhite?

147
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,900
Yes?

148
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,500
Hi. I'm Edie Britt.

149
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,300
The realtor that helped you buy this house?

150
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,500
Oh, of course. Hi.

151
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,000
Hi.
I've been so curious to meet you.

152
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,600
Really? Why?

153
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,400
It's just that I've never sold a house
over the phone before.

154
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,000
You were awfully brave,
buying the place sight unseen.

155
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Not really.

156
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,700
We could tell from the advertisement
it was just what we were looking for.

157
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,100
This is my son Matthew.

158
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,200
It's nice to meet you, ma'am.

159
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,100
Please. Call me Edie.

160
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,900
Ma'am's for... middle-aged women.

161
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,700
Like her.

162
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,300
You can call her ma'am anytime you want.

163
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,200
So are you two finding everything okay?

164
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,600
Because we didn't do 
our realtor's walk-through.

165
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,900
Everything is fine.

166
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,200
Oh, honey, escrow's closed.

167
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,800
Now I can show you where to put 
the buckets when the rain comes.

168
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,200
Edie, the house is fine.

169
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,800
But how lovely of you to stop by.

170
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,700
O...kay.

171
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,400
Here is my card.

172
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,000
Call anytime you want.

173
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,700
Bye.

174
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,000
People are very friendly
in this neighborhood.

175
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,900
Yes.
Yes, they are.

176
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,300
Mike, hi, sweetie.
I hope the job's going well.

177
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,500
Um, so I hope you're not mad,

178
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,900
but I found Mrs. Huber's journal in your truck,

179
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,000
and, well, I couldn't exactly not read it, so I did,

180
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,600
and, um, I know all about the blackmail,
so call me. We'll talk.

181
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,400
Love you. Bye.

182
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,400
I haven't heard back,
and I was getting a little concerned.

183
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,500
The girls and I were talking,

184
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,700
and, well, we think that maybe
Paul Young killed Mrs. Huber,

185
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,500
and if he did, then maybe he killed
your old girlfriend, too,

186
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,100
so we should really talk about this, so call me.

187
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,800
I love you. Bye.

188
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,200
I thought the whole point of having a cell phone
was so someone could reach you

189
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,700
when they needed to talk.

190
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,900
How can we move forward as a couple
if you won't communicate with me?

191
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,100
Mike, I need you to call me back. I mean it.

192
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,700
Love you. Bye.

193
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,100
I'm so sorry for that last phone call.

194
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,800
Um, let's just say it was the worry talking.

195
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,400
I just really need to talk to you, and...

196
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,700
Can you hang on?
I got another call.

197
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,300
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

198
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,400
Oh, my god.
Where have you been?

199
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,100
Uh, the reception's pretty lousy up here,
but I got your messages.

200
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,800
Well,  I'm really sorry
for that last message.

201
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,800
I was just, uh...

202
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,800
Stressed out?

203
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,000
Yes. Let's call it stressed out.

204
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,900
Uh... so how did you get
Martha Huber's journal?

205
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,600
Oh, um, her sister
Mrs. Tilman gave it to me.

206
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,900
She was helping me with my search.

207
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,400
I just really think we need
to give it to the police.

208
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,100
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, absolutely.

209
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,200
- Really?
- Sure. Yeah.

210
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,100
As soon as I get through with this job,

211
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,500
we'll make an appointment with that detective --
what's his name -- uh, Copeland.

212
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,900
Great. That's great.

213
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,800
All right, so I'll, uh, see you in a few hours.

214
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,500
Okay.
Hurry, though.

215
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,200
I just have a feeling that Paul Young
is in the middle of all of this.

216
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,300
Well, let's not rush to judgment.

217
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,700
What are you doing here?

218
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,800
I'm here to testify for you, Carlos.

219
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,500
- Can you take those off?
- Yes, ma'am.

220
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,900
There's no way I'm dressing him.

221
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,400
Gabby, thank god you're doing this.

222
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,700
Beating up a second gay guy?

223
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,000
It looks bad.

224
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yes, well, Carlos, in some circles,

225
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,800
beating people up at all is frowned upon.

226
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,200
So why'd you change your mind?

227
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,700
Well, I'm about to be
the mother of your child,

228
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,700
which means a lot of responsibility
and little time for myself.

229
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,000
So if I'm going to get you out of this mess,
you have to reciprocate.

230
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,100
Okay.

231
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,100
When the baby cries
in the middle of the night,

232
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,700
you're going to get up
without saying one word.

233
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,300
Doctors' appointments --
you're driving.

234
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,300
I'm not putting
a car seat in my maserati.

235
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,700
Okay.

236
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,400
And you will also be on bottle duty.

237
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,300
That means washing,
sterilizing, and filling.

238
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,300
That way I'll have
some semblance of a life,

239
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,300
and then maybe I won't hate you so much.

240
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,300
All right, there we go.

241
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,300
So we're good?

242
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,700
See you in court.

243
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,700
Hey, gabby?

244
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,900
Aren't we breast-feeding?

245
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,400
Oh, honey, if you can swing that one,
more power to you.

246
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,100
Can I buy my own pizza?

247
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,400
Uh, you can, honey,
if you can pay for it.

248
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,200
Whoo!

249
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,100
Yeah, that is 19, 19, 19-zip.
Bring it.

250
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,800
Just stay here with Penny
for a second, okay?

251
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,600
Tom.

252
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:21,300
Yes! In your face! That is 20-zip,
game out.

253
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,600
Tom, what are you doing?

254
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,700
I'm playing air hockey.
What's it look like?

255
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,300
Kevin, you're up.

256
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,300
Well, it's the middle of the day,
and shouldn't you be at work?

257
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,600
Mm, no. I quit.

258
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,500
You did not.

259
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,500
Yes.

260
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,200
Yesterday. I told Peterson
he could stick it.

261
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,300
Boom! You're not bringing it, Kevin.
Bring it.

262
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,800
Could you talk to me for a second?
I don't understand.

263
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,800
What?

264
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,700
You asked Peterson's wife
to make sure he wouldn't promote me.

265
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,700
So he gives a huge promotion
to Annabel, so I quit.

266
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,400
What don't you understand?

267
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,200
Okay. Okay.

268
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,900
Could we go home
and talk about this, please?

269
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,300
No, we can't.

270
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,500
Serve it up, meat.

271
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,800
You're just going to...
stay here and play games all day?

272
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,500
No, I'm going to go 
and get some ice cream,

273
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,500
and then I'm going to go up to the lake,
maybe rent a boat,

274
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,300
do whatever it is I feel like --

275
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:22,800
god!

276
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,300
Gotcha!

277
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,200
Tom.

278
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,500
Go home, Lynette.

279
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,900
Go home before I say something
I regret. Go home.

280
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,700
All right, you.

281
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,100
You score this next point,
you get your bike back.

282
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,100
What are you thinking about?

283
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,700
Oh, I was just, um...

284
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,400
thinking that I need
to start spring cleaning.

285
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,500
You haven't done that yet?

286
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,600
No, and I need to clean out our rain gutters,

287
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,000
and, uh, beneath the refrigerator, and...

288
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,400
I can't tell you how long it's been
since I've replaced the shelf liner, so...

289
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,300
Then you'll finish off with our wedding silver.

290
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,800
How did you know that?

291
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,100
See, all those years,
you didn't think I was paying attention.

292
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,900
But I was.

293
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,600
And do you know why I save it for last?

294
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,500
No.

295
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,200
Because it makes me think
of my aunt fern.

296
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,100
On the day we got married,
I told her how happy I was,

297
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,200
and she told me that even during bad times
to always remember

298
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,500
that the best was yet to come.

299
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,800
And so as I polish it,

300
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:41,100
I  think about you and the kids and our life
and how right she was.

301
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,500
They're going to operate on me.

302
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,100
I know.

303
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,700
I'm going to say some stuff just in case.

304
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,000
Rex, you don't have to say anything.

305
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,700
I'm sorry...
for everything I did.

306
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:02,400
The moving out...
the infidelity, the sex stuff...

307
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,500
It doesn't matter.

308
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:10,300
From here on in,
can we just say that we're even?

309
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,700
Okay.

310
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,400
Thanks.

311
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,700
And for the record...

312
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,300
you are going to come through 
this operation just fine.

313
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,300
How can you be so sure?

314
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:36,600
Because I told you --
the best is yet to come.

315
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,300
So I'll see you Sunday.

316
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,300
Don't forget to feed bongo.

317
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,500
Oh, thanks. I'll go do that now.

318
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,500
Go on in the car, sweetie.

319
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,400
I have to talk to your mom real quick.

320
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,700
So you're going to go live in sin
with the plumber/ex-con?

321
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,600
It's funny you should mention sin.

322
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,900
I think adultery still falls in that category.

323
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:15,200
I-I don't like the idea of this guy 
being around Julie 24/7.

324
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,600
He's a good person.

325
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,000
Mike's cool, dad.

326
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,300
He cares about us a lot, 
and I like having him around.

327
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,500
So don't mess this up.

328
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,200
You heard the girl.

329
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,400
He's still a plumber.

330
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,400
Now, you be a good boy, bongo,

331
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,400
or you're going to go to bed hungry.

332
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Hi, Ms. Mayer.

333
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,900
Can you sit down, please?

334
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,900
I'm just going to go get some water.

335
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,000
I'd rather you didn't.

336
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,500
Don't answer it.

337
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,500
I know you're in there, Susan.

338
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I can see you.

339
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,800
If you don't want to talk to me, fine.

340
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,400
At least have the courtesy to hide.

341
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,200
All right, but don't let her in.

342
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,400
Edie, what a pleasant surprise.

343
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,500
Right.
Is Mike home?

344
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,400
No, he's on a big plumbing job.
What's up?

345
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,600
Can I come in?

346
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,500
Why?

347
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,100
I'm warning all the neighbors.
Felicia Tilman was attacked.

348
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,400
She was?

349
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,400
At the Young house.
They just took her away in ambulance.

350
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,500
I'm totally freaked out.

351
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,900
My guys haven't shown up 
at the job site yet.

352
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm over there all alone.

353
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,500
So do you think maybe I could just come in 
and hang out for a while?

354
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,900
<font color=lightgreen>Zach is sticking a gun at me.

355
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,700
Stick it up my...what?

356
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,600
Just get the hell out of here.

357
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,900
God, you are such a bitch.

358
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,600
Why?

359
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,000
I asked Mrs. Tilman to tell me
the truth about my father.

360
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,900
She did.

361
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,300
What'd she say?

362
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,300
Mr. Delfino took my dad away to kill him.

363
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,300
Now I'm going to kill Mr. Delfino.

364
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,600
Your honor, this whole mess
is just a result of my loneliness.

365
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,400
My marriage is a bit strained,

366
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,400
and after Carlos was convicted --

367
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,700
No one's been convicted yet, Mrs. solis.

368
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,400
This is just a grand jury hearing.

369
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,400
Oh, no, no, I'm talking
about his other crime.

370
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,300
Oh. right.
Go ahead.

371
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,000
Any ways, he was placed under house arrest,

372
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,300
and he being the jealous man that he is,

373
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,400
got a little crazy every time I left the house.

374
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:09,600
He knows how men look at me,
and, well, I-I didn't exactly ease his mind.

375
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:16,600
I... falsely led him to believe
I was having an affair.

376
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,400
And -- and before Carlos's house arrest,

377
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,000
he was always working,
and he was never with me.

378
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,600
I thought that maybe if he believed
I was having an affair,

379
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,000
he would realize he loved me.

380
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,700
and I know it sounds stupid, I do.
I just --

381
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,700
Is there a point to this?

382
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:38,800
My point is that Carlos is
an angry, jealous Neanderthal.

383
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,100
But he's not a gay-basher.

384
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,100
All right, I've heard enough.
counsel, approach.

385
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,400
I got to be honest,
I don't think we have a hate crime here.

386
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,100
Just so you know, 
you beat up the wrong guy.

387
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,800
Didn't you think it was strange that 
you were the only lawn on Wisteria Lane

388
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,800
that needed to be mowed 
three times a week?

389
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,900
You are so dead.

390
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,000
You are so dead.
You are dead!

391
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,400
Aah! Carlos!

392
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,600
Dead!

393
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,800
For god's sakes, will somebody stop him?

394
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,300
Stop it!

395
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,700
We will have order!

396
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,300
I'll kill you!

397
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,500
I am going to kill you!

398
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,200
Order!

399
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,200
Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated.
We will have order.

400
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,000
Get up.

401
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,200
I'm not trying to justify anything.

402
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,200
I don't know how you knew Martha Huber,
but she ruined lives... for fun.

403
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,300
She destroyed my family.

404
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,700
This isn't about her.

405
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,300
I don't understand.

406
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,500
Walk.

407
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
Remember when we first tested you,

408
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,200
your potassium level was a bit high.

409
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
Yes, you made me stop eating bananas.

410
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,400
But as we've continued testing,
it's kept climbing.

411
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:08,400
We've now run an entire battery of tests,
and your kidney function is fine.

412
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,700
It has to be something you're ingesting.

413
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,400
Let me see.

414
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,100
These numbers can't be right.

415
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,400
Who prepares your meals?

416
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,700
Bree.

417
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,100
I understand you've been
having some marital problems.

418
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,500
Wait a minute --

419
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,500
Wasn't there also an incident at a salad bar?

420
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,600
She gave you onions
when she knew you were allergic.

421
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,300
That was an accident.

422
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:58,000
You're getting this potassium 
from somewhere.

423
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,900
Get out.

424
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,700
Rex --

425
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,800
I mean it.

426
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,300
Get out.

427
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,600
Leave the chart.

428
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,900
I want to read it.

429
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,500
So did you have a fun day?

430
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,200
As a matter of fact, I did.

431
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,600
I probably had the most fun
that I have had in a long time.

432
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,600
You know, I didn't tell you to quit.

433
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,000
No. No, no, no.

434
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,400
No, you made damn sure
that I'd go nowhere for the next 20 years.

435
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,900
I don't know what to say.

436
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,000
I hear "please forgive me" is popular.

437
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,500
Yes, I am sorry.
I am so, so sorry.

438
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,600
I didn't want to hurt you.

439
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,900
But I was trying to protect our family.

440
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,000
If you got a promotion,
we never would have seen you.

441
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,600
You would have been traveling all the --

442
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,700
Lynette, Lynette,
Lynette, you're right.

443
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,800
You're right.
You're right.

444
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:44,000
That promotion would have just killed us,
so this is going to all work out.

445
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,300
What does that mean?

446
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,900
It means that I can use the break.

447
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,800
Oh, well, yeah.

448
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,200
I think it would be good
for you to take some time off.

449
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,500
No, not some time -- full time.

450
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,200
I'm going to be a stay-at-home dad.

451
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,100
Huh?

452
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,600
What the heck?
You earn the living for a while.

453
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,100
Tom, that's... crazy.

454
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,100
Why? Why is it crazy?

455
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,400
You and I both know that
you're better at the ad game,

456
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,400
and you tell me all the time
how hard it is to be a mom.

457
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,700
Well, yes, yes, it is hard,
but I-I love it, too,

458
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,300
and I've been doing it for six years,

459
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:28,000
and I haven't complained... the entire time.

460
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,700
Fair enough.
Fair enough.

461
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:34,600
But be honest... secretly...

462
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,400
you miss the ad game, don't you?

463
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,700
I mean, you miss the pressure and the deadlines
and the -- the power lunches.

464
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,900
Or am I wrong?

465
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:49,600
Maybe -- maybe you want to sort dirty socks
the rest of your life.

466
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:55,000
We should talk about this seriously
before we make any rash decisions.

467
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I already made the decision.

468
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,400
You're going back to work.

469
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,300
Can I at least get you something to eat, Zach?

470
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,300
Maybe a soda. Thanks.

471
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I got to say, I think
you're making a mistake.

472
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,700
Mike couldn't kill anybody.

473
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:38,600
I mean...
this could just be a misunderstanding.

474
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,800
This is not a misunderstanding.

475
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,500
Listen, I know you're upset,

476
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:46,700
but is this really what you think your mother
would want you doing?

477
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,100
Probably not.

478
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,000
Exactly.
Because she raised you right.

479
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,700
Look, you have been through a lot.

480
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,400
You've lost your mom,

481
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,000
you're still carrying around the guilt
over what happened to your baby sister --

482
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,500
I never had a baby sister.

483
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,500
Honey, I know about Dana.

484
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,500
How stupid are you?

485
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,700
I'm Dana.

486
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,400
My mother was some junkie.

487
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,600
They stole me and changed my name.

488
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,000
They have been lying to me my entire life.

489
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,700
Everyone lies to me!

490
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,000
My mother, my father,
Mrs. Tilman, even Julie.

491
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,600
Do you understand how much that hurts?!

492
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,300
Look, Zach...
I know you're upset.

493
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,400
Let's just -- let's just sit down and talk.

494
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,100
Why?!
So you can lie to me also?!

495
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,100
No more talking.

496
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:12,900
<font color=lightgreen>Bree, I understand and I forgive you

497
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,500
Hello?

498
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,600
Bree, it's Dr. Craig.

499
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,800
I'm at the hospital,
and I'm afraid I have some bad news.

500
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,200
Oh?

501
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,500
Rex passed away about 10 minutes ago.

502
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,600
But his operation -- it's not until tomorrow.

503
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,700
I know.
He just didn't make it.

504
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:02,000
I'm so sorry.
We did everything we could.

505
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,300
Bree.

506
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,300
Yes, of course you did.

507
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,200
Thank you very much for calling.

508
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,800
This is a long way to go to do
what you could have done in my backyard.

509
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,800
You're kind of taking your time,
walking a lot.

510
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,800
You sure you know what you're doing?

511
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,200
You ever actually had to kill
anyone for real before?

512
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,900
Yeah.

513
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,400
Oh.

514
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,500
Since you're so tired of walking,
let's just do this here.

515
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:34,400
I don't expect any favors
from you, obviously.

516
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,400
But could you at least do me the courtesy
of telling me why we're here?

517
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,600
You knew Dierdre.

518
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,000
Yeah.

519
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,600
And I know what you did to her.

520
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,000
She was just a sad girl
with a lot of problems,

521
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,700
and she did some terrible,
crazy, selfish stuff,

522
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:06,900
but you tell me what she ever could have done 
to deserve death at the hands of somebody like you.

523
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,400
It's complicated.

524
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,500
It's, uh... complicated.

525
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:24,100
<font color=yellow>And just like that, my husband began
sharing my secrets...

526
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,800
You want some carrots, Zachary?

527
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,500
Secrets I had died to protect.

528
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,900
There you go.

529
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,400
We have to get that fence up in the backyard
before the pool's finished.

530
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,100
I know.

531
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,800
I'm serious.

532
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,000
You know how kids are drawn to water.

533
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,400
Hello, Angela.

534
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,400
You did a good job covering your tracks.

535
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,500
I had to spend a lot of my father's money
hunting you down.

536
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,000
Congratulations.
You found us.

537
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,400
You know, I never told
the police what happened.

538
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,400
You didn't?

539
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,600
They would have put Dana in foster care --

540
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,300
or worse, given him to my father.

541
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,200
So I kept our little secret.

542
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,300
Well... we appreciate that.

543
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:42,300
Anyway, I guess you can see
I've gotten myself cleaned up.

544
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,200
Yes, you look lovely.

545
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:50,300
I'm not the same person
you knew back then, Angela.

546
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,900
I'm in a good place now.

547
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,500
You can't have him.

548
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,900
Just because I didn't go to the police 
before doesn't mean I can't do it now.

549
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,400
Zach is our son.

550
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,300
His name is Dana.

551
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,700
If you think I'm giving my baby
to some junkie, you're crazy.

552
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,900
He's not your baby.

553
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,900
Just calm down.

554
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,300
You were always so high 
and mighty back at the clinic,

555
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,700
looking down on us poor degenerates,

556
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,700
pretending you wanted to help
when all you really wanted was to feel superior.

557
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,300
You self-righteous bitch.

558
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,300
You're still using, aren't you?

559
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,500
Go to hell.

560
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,200
What are you doing?

561
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:23,900
Let me see your arm.

562
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,000
I said I'm clean!

563
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Take it easy.
Let's just take it easy.

564
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,600
Where do you think you're going?

565
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,600
I'm getting my son, 
and I'm taking him home.

566
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,300
Paul, stop her.

567
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,300
Deirdre, please. Come on.

568
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,600
- Sit down. Sit down.
- Get your hands off me!

569
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,900
We raised him. We're his parents.

570
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,100
Come on. Come on.

571
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:42,900
Aah!

572
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,400
Paul!

573
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,800
Don't worry.

574
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,100
I'll give him a good home.

575
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,600
No!

576
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,800
Oh, Mary Alice...
What did you do?

577
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,500
Mommy?

578
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,600
It's okay, Zach.

579
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,600
Mommy needs to borrow your toy chest.

580
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,100
You go back to sleep, okay?

581
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,600
What are we going to do?

582
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:15,100
You said they were pouring the concrete
for the pool tomorrow?

583
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,600
You can't be serious.

584
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,200
They'll never find her.

585
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,500
We can put her in this.

586
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,800
She won't fit.

587
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,600
Then we'll have to make her fit.

588
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,300
What are you doing?

589
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,800
Checking for track marks.

590
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,800
Deirdre had a baby?

591
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:20,100
Let's get this over with.

592
00:40:54,200 --> 00:41:00,200
<font color=yellow>It's an odd thing to look back on the world,
to watch those I left behind.

593
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:08,200
<font color=yellow>Each in her own way so brave, so determined,
and so very desperate.

594
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,900
<font color=yellow>Desperate to venture out,

595
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,700
<font color=yellow>but afraid of what she'll miss when she goes.

596
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,300
<font color=yellow>Desperate to get everything she wants,

597
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:28,300
<font color=yellow>even when she's not exactly sure of what that is.

598
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:35,800
<font color=yellow>Desperate for life to be perfect again,

599
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:41,100
<font color=yellow>although she realizes it never really was.

600
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,300
<font color=yellow>Desperate for a better future,

601
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:52,100
<font color=yellow>if she can find a way to escape her past.

602
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,100
<font color=yellow>I not only watch,

603
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:01,500
<font color=yellow>I cheer them on,
these amazing women.

604
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:07,900
<font color=yellow>I hope so much they'll find
what they're looking for.

605
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:13,600
<font color=yellow>But I know not all of them will.

606
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,500
<font color=yellow>Sadly...

607
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,300
<font color=yellow>that's just not the way life works.

608
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:28,800
<font color=yellow>Not everyone gets a happy ending.
