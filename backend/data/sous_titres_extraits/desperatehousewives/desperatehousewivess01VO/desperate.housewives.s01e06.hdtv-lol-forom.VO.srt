1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,300
Previously on "desperate housewives"

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,000
I know why my mom killed herself.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Secrets were revealed.

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,700
This is getting really weird.

5
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,800
I think we should go to the police.

6
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,700
Relationships got complicated.

7
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,600
Mama Solis. What are you doing here?

8
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,900
So you think she's cheating on you?

9
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,600
I think so.

10
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,300
I'll take care of it.

11
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,700
We got a call --something about a break-in.

12
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,403
I thought I'd seen a lot on the job,
but this is something else.

13
00:00:18,403 --> 00:00:19,700
And the mystery...

14
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,000
Zach, why did you do this?

15
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,800
I don't know.

16
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,800
Deepened.

17
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,900
Zach.

18
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,900
Suburbia is a battle ground,

19
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,500
an arena for all forms of domestic combat.

20
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,500
Husbands clash with wives,

21
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,900
parents cross swords with children,

22
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,600
but the bloodiest battles often involve women

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,800
and their mothers-in-law.

24
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,500
The war for control of Carlos began the night he proposed,

25
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,000
and Gabrielle had been losing ground to Juanita ever since.

26
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,100
From the prenuptial agreement,

27
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,100
which she reluctantly signed...

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,600
to the selection of wedding music she despised...

29
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,400
to the color of the house paint she hadn't wanted,

30
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,600
Gabrielle had suffered one defeat after another.

31
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,200
And now that Juanita suspected her
daughter-in-law of having an affair,

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,700
it had become increasingly apparent in this war...

33
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,600
Mrs. Solis? I'll be at the market.

34
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,900
No prisoners would be taken.

35
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,800
Thank you, Yao Lin.

36
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,700
I don't see why you have her.

37
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,300
It's a big house. I need help.

38
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,800
It's only called help when you do some of the work yourself.

39
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,700
I supervise.

40
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,700
You pay her $300 a week.

41
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,900
Mm-hmm.

42
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,000
That's $15,000 a year.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,700
Carlos, you always say how you're not
putting away enough for retirement.

44
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,400
You know, baby, it would be a good
idea if we cut back on expenses.

45
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,400
You expect me to take care of this place all by myself?

46
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,900
Other women manage.

47
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,800
Ahem.

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,500
That's nice.

49
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,400
You like that?

50
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,600
Oh, yeah.

51
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,400
God, I'm going to miss this, Carlos.

52
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,200
What do you mean?

53
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,900
Well, since...

54
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,600
I'm going to have to be doing the cooking

55
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,000
and the cleaning and all the
shopping like the other wives...

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
mm-hmm.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,900
I'm going to be exhausted at night,

58
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,800
just like all the other wives.

59
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,200
Till I build up my stamina, of course.

60
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,100
And that might take a couple years.

61
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,200
Sadly for Juanita,

62
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,500
she had ignored the first rule of war.

63
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,600
Good morning, Carlos.

64
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,200
The maid stays.

65
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,100
Never underestimate your enemy.

66
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,000
<font color=F62B97>Episode 6 : Running to Stand Still

67
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,600
Of the many suburban rituals,

68
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,400
none is quite so cherished
as the neighborhood yard sale.

69
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,800
The shoppers come to sift through the discarded
belongings of someone they don't really know

70
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,000
in hopes of finding bargains
they don't really need,

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
each so determined to save a few pennies,

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,300
they often miss hidden treasures.

73
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,800
Hey, Paul.

74
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,700
Hi, Susan.

75
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,200
& nbsp;

76
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,600
Got to say, I was a little surprised
to see Mary Alice's award for sale.

77
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,300
She got it for doing charity work
from the Chamber of Commerce.

78
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,500
Zach and I are moving.

79
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,400
We don't need to carry any more with us
than is absolutely necessary.

80
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,800
That makes sense.

81
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,100
Still, I just wanted to make sure
you didn't want to keep it for Zach,

82
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,500
something to remember his mother by.

83
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,100
Zach doesn't need a piece of glass
to remember his mother.

84
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,800
I'm out of newspaper.

85
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,300
Here.

86
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,200
Let's call it 10 bucks for everything.

87
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,400
Great.

88
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,200
Speaking of Zach,

89
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,200
haven't seen him around lately.

90
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,700
He's been a bit depressed.

91
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,400
I thought he could use a change of scenery,
so I sent him to stay with relatives.

92
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,200
Oh. Which ones?

93
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,300
You don't know them.

94
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,900
So how'd you get the fat lip?

95
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,000
The usual way -- asking too many questions.

96
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,700
Did you find out where Zach is?

97
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,900
No, but I can tell you this much --
he's not staying with relatives.

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,500
It's driving me crazy, mama.

99
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,800
I mean, it could be any one of these guys
she's having an affair with.

100
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,100
Don't worry about it.

101
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,200
I'm not letting her out of my sight.

102
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,200
Now who the hell is that?

103
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,396
And look at the way she's touching him.

104
00:05:45,396 --> 00:05:47,000
You think that's the guy
she's having the affair with?

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,300
Carlos, don't be stupid.

106
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,910
A guy she talks to in public

107
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,000
isn't someone you're going to worry about.

108
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,700
So it's someone that she doesn't talk to.

109
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,100
What do I have to do,

110
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,800
beat up every guy in town?

111
00:05:58,801 --> 00:06:00,402
Marriage takes work.

112
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,100
I'm not surprised he's
playing it close to the vest.

113
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,300
Paul knows we're on to him.

114
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,011
Zach said Mary Alice killed herself

115
00:06:08,011 --> 00:06:10,700
because of something that
he had done, something bad.

116
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,000
Is there anyone else who'd know
what he was talking about?

117
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,700
No. That's why we have to find him.
It's the only way we'll know the truth.

118
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,700
It just doesn't make any sense.

119
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,300
Zach is such a sweet kid.

120
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,300
I can't imagine him
doing anything that terrible.

121
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,100
Well, he did break into your house.

122
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,100
I mean, the kid's obviously troubled in some way.

123
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,200
Severe depression,

124
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,500
borderline personality disorder --

125
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,200
Zach is a deeply troubled young man.

126
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,800
I'm aware of that.

127
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,300
What are you giving him?

128
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,000
Some antidepressants and a mood stabilizer.

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,200
Good.

130
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,300
I'm also recommending extensive psychotherapy

131
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,600
to help unearth any repressed memory.

132
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,800
I don't think so.

133
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,400
Mr. Young, I can't just
medicate him indefinitely.

134
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,500
Forget the Freud and stick with the drugs.

135
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,400
No new treatments without my permission.

136
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,600
I think this is going to be a great
version of "Little Red Riding Hood,"

137
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:16,200
and it is your involvement that make the plays
here at Barcliff Academy so special.

138
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,300
Thank you.

139
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,900
And now, I would liketo turn over the next
part of our meeting to our parent coordinator

140
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,300
the amazing Maisy Gibbons.

141
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,900
Thank you, Ms. Truesdale.

142
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:35,400
Now, before everyone leaves,
we have new copies of the script up here.

143
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,400
Tilda and Frances and I went to the rehearsal yesterday,

144
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,302
and we were a little troubled by the ending.

145
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,003
Killing the wolf --

146
00:07:44,003 --> 00:07:46,200
it sends the wrong message to our kids,

147
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:51,700
and we believe that animals should only
be euthanized as a last resort.

148
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,000
Do you find something amusing?

149
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,400
I'm sorry, I thought you were kidding.

150
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,900
No.

151
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,800
& nbsp;

152
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,000
Oh, okay.

153
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:09,200
So in our version, the wolf is aggressive
because he has a thorn in his paw,

154
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,000
and the woodsman will take out the thorn
and send Mr. Wolf on his way.

155
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,100
I'm sorry. Aren't we doing "Little Red Riding Hood"?

156
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,900
Yes.

157
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,200
So then you are aware that the wolf is a bad guy.

158
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,100
He eats Little Red's grandma.

159
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,900
If you let him go, he's just going
to chow down on other defenseless old ladies.

160
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
I-I'm sorry. And you are...

161
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,500
I'm Lynette Scavo.

162
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,500
My twins just joined.
They're playing oak trees.

163
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,700
Oh, of course. Lynette.

164
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,900
Uh, let's see. You are signed up to take
tickets the night of the show. Is that right?

165
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,100
Yeah.

166
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,100
Well, with all due respect,

167
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:50,000
let's leave the creative suggestions to the
mothers who've assumed the heavy lifting, shall we?

168
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,800
Sure.

169
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,800
Whatever.

170
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,600
I must say, I'm jealous of how
much time you two spend together.

171
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,200
My mother-in-law would never want
to hang out with me all day.

172
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,600
She sounds nice.

173
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,500
Hey.

174
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,100
Oh, hey there, you two.

175
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,600
Hi, John.

176
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,000
Hi, Mrs. Solis.

177
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,800
I wasn't aware you two were friends.

178
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,900
Yeah. We go to the same school.

179
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,700
Of course you do.

180
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,400
Mom, if you need anything,
we'll be upstairs in my room studying.

181
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
Have fun.

182
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,600
Doesn't it make you nervous --

183
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,800
a boy alone upstairs with Danielle?

184
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,600
Oh, no, I don't worry about John.

185
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,400
Both he and Danielle are in the Abstinence Club.

186
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,000
Coffee's a little hot.

187
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,800
Susan was infuriated by Paul's evasive answers.

188
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,500
She was convinced he was deliberately hiding Zach

189
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,100
and hiding the truth.

190
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,200
She hoped that finding one would lead to the other.

191
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,800
To succeed,

192
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,700
Susan would have to be evasive herself.

193
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
Susan.

194
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,700
Well, long time no see.

195
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,400
Mrs. Greenberg.

196
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,900
Do you remember those two eggs
I let you borrow last Christmas?

197
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,500
I need those back.

198
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,500
Well, gosh, honey, I'm fresh out,
but if you want, I could run to the store.

199
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,200
Oh, forget about it. It's not that important.

200
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:42,500
But since I'm here, do you still have
that old hatch back sitting in your garage?

201
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,900
Can I borrow it tomorrow?

202
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,900
You want to borrow my car?

203
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,900
Just for a couple of hours.

204
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,600
Well, I'm not sure.
Do you know how to drive a stick?

205
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,500
Yes, I think so. I learned in college.

206
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,600
It's like riding a bike, right?

207
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
I'm not sure, dear.

208
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,800
It's no big deal.

209
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
It's just for a couple of hours.

210
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,500
I let you borrow my eggs for a whole year.

211
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,200
First off, I'm very pleased with the work
we've done in our sessions thus far.

212
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,200
We're making excellent progress.

213
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,500
Thank you. I feel really good about it.

214
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,800
But there are a few areas of your
marriage we haven't covered yet.

215
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,000
Oh, really? Like what?

216
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,000
Um...

217
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,100
I've told Dr. Goldfine our private
sessions that I'm not happy with our sex life.

218
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:38,200
And Rex feels that when the two
of you have intercourse,

219
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,100
you're not as connected as you could be.

220
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,800
Connected?

221
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,000
Well, yeah.

222
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's like you're thinking about other things.

223
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,400
Is your hair getting messed up,
did you remember to buy the tooth paste?

224
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,900
You're just not there.

225
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,800
This kind of disconnect is often
a symptom of a deeper problem.

226
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,300
So we were talking, and the idea
of a sexual surrogate came up.

227
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,100
This is a licensed professional
who'd work with you as a couple

228
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,800
on solving whatever sexual problems you may be having.

229
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,200
I have an excellent referral.

230
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,100
Hmm. And what would this sexual surrogate person do?

231
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,200
Well, she would coach us.

232
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,900
She.

233
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,600
She's very discreet.
You'll hardly notice she's there.

234
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,000
Oh.

235
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,700
So she would be in the room with us
while we make love?

236
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,200
Yes, helping us to achieve maximum sexual potential.

237
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,900
Hmm.

238
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,200
Do you have any questions?

239
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,900
Just one.

240
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,100
How much longer is your midlife crisis going to last?

241
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,200
Because it is really starting to tick me off.

242
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,100
All right, everyone's down for a nap.

243
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,500
We've got no more than an hour.

244
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,900
Let's get cracking.

245
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,000
5-card draw, nothing wild.

246
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,600
So how is it going with Mike, Susan?

247
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,800
It's going, finally.

248
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,400
We have our first official date next week.

249
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,000
I think he's taking me to see a play or something.

250
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,900
Might I suggest the Barcliff Academy
production of "Little Red Riding Hood"?

251
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,200
Oh, that's right --the twins' stage debut.

252
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,300
Are they having fun?

253
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,700
Sure, they get to play oak trees.

254
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm the one that has to deal with
all the drama behind the scenes.

255
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,900
Oh, I take it you've met Maisy Gibbons.

256
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,800
She's a total nightmare.

257
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,500
I guess I shouldn't have challenged her.

258
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,100
Oh, dear.

259
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,300
Because now no one on the play
committee even wants to talk to me.

260
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,300
Oh, Maisy does love to rule her little kingdom.

261
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,300
It hasn't really changed since girl scouts.

262
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,100
Girls smile at you to your face, and then
behind your back, they make fun of you

263
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,700
'cause you're the only one not shaving her legs yet.

264
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,900
That would have never happened in boy scouts.

265
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,100
When I worked, mostly with men,
I preferred the way they fought.

266
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,000
A guy takes his opponent on face-to-face,

267
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,500
and once he's won, he's top dog.

268
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,800
It's primitive, but it's fair.

269
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,100
And a lot less sneaky.

270
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,300
Isn't is sexist of us to generalize like this?

271
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,500
It's science, Gabrielle.
Sociologists have documented this stuff.

272
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,500
Well, who am I to argue with sociologists?

273
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:13,100
Wow, this, uh, this guacamole has got a kick.

274
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm going to run to the little girls' room.

275
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You guys go ahead.

276
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,800
I might be a while.

277
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,200
I hate playing 3-handed poker.
Let's take a break.

278
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,500
I'll play.

279
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,300
You play poker?

280
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,800
I used to play a little with my grandfather.

281
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
Pull up a chair.

282
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,200
Oh, I notice you're just playing for chips.

283
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,000
My grandfather used to say
it's always more fun to play for money.

284
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,200
Why not? 50 cents a bet?

285
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,300
Make it a buck. 3-raise limit, $20 buy-in.

286
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,400
Mrs. Solis. What are you doing?

287
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,600
Why haven't you returned any of my phone calls?

288
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,100
I've been busy.

289
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,300
Yeah, I-I've seen who you've been busy with.

290
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,800
Danielle? Come on. I mean, she's just a friend.

291
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,800
Well, before you get any friendlier, let me remind you,

292
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,100
I can do things to you she can't even pronounce.

293
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,900
Well, a lot of good it does me, with your
mother-in-law following you around all the time.

294
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,300
Look, maybe we should just cool it for a while.

295
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,300
Oh, no, John, please don't say that.

296
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,800
I have everything under control.

297
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,600
Now give me a boost.

298
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,700
Hey. So what did I miss?

299
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,300
Not much. Just a few friendly hands
of poker with the girls.

300
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,000
As I'm sure you have all heard,

301
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Celia Bond broke her wrist playing tennis,

302
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,600
which means we are now in desperate need
of someone to do the costumes.

303
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,300
I'm keeping my fingers crossed here.
Are there any volunteers?

304
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,000
I'll do it.

305
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,600
Really? That's a --do you know how to sew?

306
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,700
Absolutely.

307
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,900
Well, uh, great. Thank you, Lynette.

308
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:40,300
Okay, so now that I'm going to do some heavy lifting,

309
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,200
I believe I have the right to talk
about the changes made to the script.

310
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,000
Um...

311
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,300
ladies

312
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,300
We all grew up with "Little Red Riding Hood,"

313
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,300
and we survived it, scary stuff and all,

314
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,100
so I say to hell with political correctness.

315
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,600
Let our kids experience this classic
like it was meant to be enjoyed.

316
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,900
Let's kill the damn wolf,
and just put on the best show we can.

317
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,600
Thank you, Lynette, for that impassioned speech,

318
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,000
but I believe that ship has sailed.

319
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,600
No, it hasn't. We still have time
to change the ending back.

320
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And, you know, Maisy, it is just a fairy tale.

321
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,900
I don't think it will upset the children.

322
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,000
Well, I think you're wrong.

323
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Well, that's what so great about being in a democracy.

324
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,100
Everyone's entitled to their opinion.

325
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,000
Also, everyone has a right to vote,

326
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,500
so all in favor of the woodsman
going medieval on the big bad wolf's ass...

327
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,600
Oh! Oh!

328
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,800
Dr. Goldfine.

329
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,700
Bree.

330
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,400
You're dining alone?

331
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
Actually, I am.

332
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,700
Well, what a coincidence. So am I.

333
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,700
Seems a shame for us to eat by ourselves.
Shall I pull up a chair?

334
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,200
Bree, it's nothing personal,
but I never socialize with clients.

335
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,000
Oh.

336
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,600
Oh, I get it.

337
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,300
I'm so sorry. Of course, it's -- it's in appropriate.

338
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:36,400
It's just that after what happened yesterday,
there's so much I need to say, because --

339
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,300
I suppose it can wait.

340
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,400
No, Lynette, I'm sorry. Juanita's taking a bath.

341
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,300
Well, how much did she win from you?

342
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,500
Jeez.

343
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,800
Yeah, I guess she'll take a check.

344
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,700
Okay.

345
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,600
All right, bye.

346
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,700
What was that about?

347
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,200
Turns out your mother is quite the card shark.

348
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,900
You let her play cards.

349
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,000
How long did she play?

350
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,500
Not that long. Why?

351
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,100
Carlos, what is it?

352
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,300
I never told you this, but my mother
had a serious gambling problem.

353
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,100
Was this before we were married?

354
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,400
Yeah.

355
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,100
It was bad.

356
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,300
She went into debt.

357
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,700
She dipped into her savings, started hocking jewelry.

358
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,000
Honey, it was only a small neighborhood game.

359
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,600
But it doesn't take much for her to fall off the wagon.

360
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,300
I know she seems like a very strong woman, but --

361
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,500
she has a major weakness.

362
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,800
Honey...

363
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,500
oh.

364
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,200
It's okay.

365
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,400
You were right to tell me this.

366
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,300
And you understand I have to treat this as a session.

367
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,300
Of course. That's fine.

368
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,500
Shall I, um, include the meal?

369
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,400
Oh, no. We'll split that.

370
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,100
Okay.

371
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,500
So let's talk about yesterday.

372
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,000
Uh, do you think there might have been
some truth in what Rex said?

373
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,800
No, I don't.

374
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:49,200
Bree, you know, it's not uncommon for people experiencing
sexual repression to distance themselves during the act.

375
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,500
Is that how you see me --as some sort of prude
who just lays there like a cold fish?

376
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,200
I love sex.

377
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,100
All right.

378
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,000
I love everything about it --

379
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,800
the sensations, the smells.

380
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,200
I especially love the feel of a man,

381
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,400
all that muscle and sinew pressed against my body.

382
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,500
And then, when you add friction...

383
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,400
mm.

384
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:19,300
The tactile sensation of running my tongue
over a man's nipple ever so gently.

385
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,900
And then there's the act itself --

386
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:25,800
two bodies becoming one
in that final eruption of pleasure.

387
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,900
To be honest, the only thing I don't
like about sex is the scrotum.

388
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:34,100
I mean, obviously, it has its practical
applications, but I'm just not a fan.

389
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,000
Can I get you something?

390
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,200
Uh, just the check, please.

391
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,400
Sir, you haven't ordered yet.

392
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,100
Oh.

393
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,000
We're not shopping?

394
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,100
Oh, I thought we'd stop here for lunch first.

395
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,800
This place has the best buffet in town --
all-you-can-eat crab legs.

396
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,900
Oh, no.

397
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,200
What's wrong? Let's go.

398
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,900
I didn't realize how late it was.

399
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,700
They're only holding the suede mini for me
until 2:00. If we stay, I'll never make it.

400
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,500
We'll just have lunch at the mall.

401
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,400
Wait. Uh...

402
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,400
I'm really in the mood for crab legs.

403
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,400
Why don't you just drop me off,
and you can come back?

404
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,200
Well, if the mall's crowded, it might take over an hour.

405
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,600
It's a buffet. There's no rush.

406
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,300
Hi, John.

407
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,200
Motel, 10 minutes. Be there.

408
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,700
All right, off you go. Thanks.

409
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,200
Ooh, Lynette.

410
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:40,200
I couldn't help but notice you forgot the coonskin
on that hunter's coonskin cap.

411
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,300
Oh, yeah.

412
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,600
That was a creative call.

413
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,400
Look, I'm in the middle of a costume crisis,

414
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,700
and if I don't take a few shortcuts,
I'll never finish.

415
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,600
Well, Jordana Geist manages to get her work done.

416
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,100
She runs the concessions, paints the sets,

417
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,800
and still has time to take care
of her three kids and a husband.

418
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,800
Now, we can't have the students suffer

419
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,400
just because you don't understand
the concept of time management.

420
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,400
I hardly think the kids are going to suffer
without a clump of fur on their heads.

421
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,700
Okay.

422
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,500
I'll make a creative call.

423
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,800
We'll cut the oak trees.

424
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
That forest is looking a little dense anyway.

425
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,600
My boys are the oak trees.

426
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,000
Are they?

427
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,800
Well, I wouldn't worry.

428
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,500
We'll find something for them to do backstage.

429
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,600
That's where the real action is.

430
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,400
I'll finish the costumes.

431
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,300
Well, crisis averted.

432
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,600
You have lost your mind.

433
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,900
I checked upon this Silvercrest place.

434
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,600
It's a treatment centerfor troubled kids.

435
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,000
Who's going to notice one more?

436
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,600
I create the distraction, you blend in and find Zach.

437
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,400
How am I supposed to blend in
with a bunch of messed-up teenagers?

438
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,800
I don't know, Julie.

439
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,800
Pretend to be bulimic. Gag a little.

440
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,200
Come on. Work with me here.

441
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,100
Mom, when this is over, we need to
talk about your parenting skills.

442
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
Okay.

443
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,100
Fine, you don't want to help me,

444
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,400
I'm not going to force you.

445
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,400
It's not that I don't want to, it's just...

446
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,800
why does this mean so much to you?

447
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
'Cause Mary Alice was a wonderful person,

448
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,600
and now all anybody thinks about her

449
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,400
is that she went off the deep end
and did this terrible, selfish thing.

450
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,600
And I think there's more to it than that.

451
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,800
She was my friend, Julie,

452
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,200
and I owe it to her to find out the truth.

453
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,600
Juanita, what's wrong?

454
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,800
Juanita.

455
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,400
I didn't go to the buffet.

456
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,000
I went gambling instead, and I lost.

457
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,700
Well, how much did you have on you?

458
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,400
It couldn't have been much.

459
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,000
I used Carlos's credit card.

460
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,600
Okay, well, how much did you charge?

461
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,600
I don't know. It stopped working.

462
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,200
What do you mean, it stopped working?

463
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,500
This thing has, like, a $15,000 credit limit.

464
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,800
Oh.

465
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,300
The man at the desk said there were no vacant rooms.

466
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,400
Mind if I bunk with you?

467
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,800
Bree, what are you doing here?

468
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,800
It's a little chilly out here.

469
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,500
Do you mind if we discuss this inside?

470
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,500
Come on in.

471
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,100
Sure is nice and toasty in here.

472
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,100
You look amazing.

473
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,000
Thanks.

474
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,500
I was hoping you'd notice.

475
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,400
Well, it certainly isn't the Ritz,

476
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,000
but it has all the essentials.

477
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,300
I don't know what to say.

478
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:36,300
Well, then, perhaps you should say nothing.

479
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,100
Take it off.

480
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,700
Rex.

481
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,400
Mm, yeah?

482
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,300
Baby, just, um...

483
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,300
mm, I just need a minute.

484
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,000
What?

485
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,700
Sweetie, just leave it, will you?

486
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,300
Okay.

487
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,100
Just leave it.

488
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,300
Oh.

489
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,600
Okay, baby. Where were we?

490
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,800
I told you to leave it.

491
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,100
I'm sorry. I just --

492
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,900
Aw, come on. Are you going to make a big deal about this?

493
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,800
You know...

494
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,500
to tell you the truth...

495
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,200
now is not really a good time for me.

496
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,600
Well, it's obvious you've never
had to remove a cheese stain.

497
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,300
Seriously, I'm going to be fine.

498
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,700
Yeah -- ow. Okay. Thanks anyway. Bye-bye.

499
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,000
Well, I'm a little ahead with my painting.

500
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,500
Do you need some help?

501
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:29,500
Oh, Jordana, you are
a life saver. Thank you.

502
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,500
Here, these pieces need trim.

503
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,500
I'll help for as long as I can,
but I have a lot on my plate tonight.

504
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,000
I have to make 25 mini-quiches
for my book club.

505
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,800
You're not human, are you?

506
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,100
You were sent by aliens to make
the human race feel inadequate.

507
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,300
Seriously, how do --how do you cram it all in?

508
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,500
Can you keep a secret?

509
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,800
Um, sure.

510
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,100
That's A.D.D. medication.

511
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,000
Well, my kids take this --or they almost did.

512
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,700
I thought it was supposed to calm you down.

513
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,600
Mnh-mnh. Has the opposite effect if you
don't have attention-deficit disorder.

514
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,600
Ever chug a pot of turkish coffee?

515
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,400
Seriously -- y-you're taking your kids' medication?

516
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,200
Once in a while.

517
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,100
Do you want a couple?

518
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,100
Oh, that's very kind of you,

519
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,100
but I just smoked some crack a little
while ago, so they better not mix.

520
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,100
This is what we'll do --

521
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,500
I'll sell some old jewelry, pay off the credit card,

522
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,200
and Carlos will never find out.

523
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,000
You would do that for me?

524
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,400
Of course I would. Why wouldn't I?

525
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,800
Well, for starters, you hate me.

526
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,200
Oh, that is overstating it...

527
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,600
a little.

528
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,300
The bottom line is, no matter how much
I dislike you, I love Carlos more.

529
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,800
If Carlos finds out about the money,
he'll be devastated.

530
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,500
I don't want to see him hurt.

531
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,200
You don't have to believe I'm a good person,

532
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,100
but at least believe I care about my husband.

533
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,100
Fine. To heck with it.

534
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,500
I'm not going to risk my neck to protect you.

535
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,500
I'm calling Carlos.

536
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,900
Juanita might have been
the gambler of the family...

537
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,700
Wait. I believe you.

538
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:30,000
But Gabrielle was the one who knew how to bluff.

539
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,000
Hi, I'm Susan Mayer.

540
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,600
I have an appointment to see Dr. Sicker.

541
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,800
Yes, yes. He's expecting you. Let me get him for you.

542
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,600
Hi. I'm Dr. Sicker.

543
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,700
Susan Mayer.

544
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,500
So you're here doing research
for a children's book.

545
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,000
I sure am.

546
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,300
Zach?

547
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,400
Oh. Hi, Julie.

548
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,100
What's wrong with you?

549
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,700
Just all these pills they make me take.

550
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,500
They kind of make me sleepy.

551
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,800
What are you doing here?

552
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,600
I came to see how you were
and to ask you something.

553
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,300
Look, I don't have much time.

554
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,800
What is it?

555
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,900
Last week, you told Mrs. Van de Kamp that your mom
killed herself because of something you did,

556
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,700
something bad.

557
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,900
What were you talking about?

558
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:57,000
After my mom died, I started remembering
things that happened when I was little.

559
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,900
What happened to Dana.

560
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,100
Dana? Who's Dana?

561
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,900
What are you doing here?

562
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,200
I was just visiting my friend.

563
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,500
This patient is not allowed visitors.

564
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,800
I guess I have to go.

565
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,900
I am so sorry, Zach.

566
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,400
Hi.

567
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,100
I don't want to disturb you. I've just, uh...

568
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,600
left some important papers here.

569
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,800
What are you doing?

570
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,600
I'm repairing a chipped mug.

571
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,700
Why don't you just buy a new one?

572
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,500
Because I think it's better to fix what you already have.

573
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,500
Listen, um...

574
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,800
about what happened today...

575
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,100
you humiliated me, Rex,

576
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,900
for no good reason.

577
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,200
I'm sorry.

578
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,500
I was there, I was willing.

579
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,800
Normal men don't say no to that.

580
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,600
You -- you upset me.

581
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,100
See, but I don't think that's the reason.

582
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,700
After I left the motel,

583
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,000
I, um, did some thinking about us and

584
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,100
our sex life,

585
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,900
and I realized there has been a disconnect,

586
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,600
but it's coming from you.

587
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,500
That's ridiculous.

588
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,600
How many years have we been making love
when you've started to ask me something,

589
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,800
but then you stop?

590
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,500
I-I don't know what you're talking about.

591
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,700
You are unhappy with our sex life because
you're not getting something from me,

592
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,600
but you're simply too afraid to ask.

593
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:53,300
My -- my problem with our sex life is that
you can't stop thinking about the housework.

594
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,000
Well, if that's the case,
then take me right here, right now.

595
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,300
The house is spotless, there are no burritos
lying around to pull my focus.

596
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,500
I'm not in the mood.

597
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,500
Why not?

598
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,500
We haven't had sex for months, Rex.

599
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:09,100
Most normal, red-blooded men
would be climbing the walls by now.

600
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,300
Please don't do this.

601
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:15,000
Rex, whatever you want, I'll go there with you.

602
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,700
I will go there with you.
You just have to say it out loud.

603
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,900
Tell me. What do you want? What do you need?

604
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,600
- I need for you to stop talking like this.
- Why?

605
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,500
Because you sound like a whore.

606
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,700
No, I don't. I sound like a woman
whose husband won't touch her.

607
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,300
Rex,

608
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,000
after Mary Alice killed herself,

609
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,700
it -- it all hit me.

610
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,300
We all have our secrets, and I think
it's time for you to tell me yours.

611
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,400
I'm going.

612
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
That night, while most of Wisteria
Lane dreamt the night away,

613
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,500
Lynette was in the middle of her own personal nightmare.

614
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,100
Determined her boys would not
miss their fairy tale debut,

615
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,900
Lynette had stayed up 18 hours straight sewing.

616
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,200
But she began to fear her story
would not have a happy ending.

617
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:44,800
Luckily for Lynette, she had a magic potion handy.

618
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,300
And once she had taken it...

619
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,700
the magic kept working...

620
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,800
and working...

621
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,400
and working.

622
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,900
It wasn't until noon that Lynette finally took a break,

623
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,700
and the reality of what she had done

624
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,100
began to sink in.

625
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,900
My, what big eyes you have.

626
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,000
Mama Juanita, I'm going to the store.
Do you need anything?

627
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I'm fine, thank you.

628
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,300
So what's been going on with her?

629
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,000
Have you found anything out yet?

630
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,300
Actually, Carlos, the more I watch her,

631
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:46,400
the more I think she's probably not stepping out on you.

632
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,300
Really?

633
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:51,200
Yeah. She's not perfect, lord knows,

634
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,700
but she loves you.

635
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,900
I can tell.

636
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,700
Mama.

637
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,000
Oh, you don't know what a relief it is to hear that.

638
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,700
Well, you know, it's funny.

639
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,400
I really think she loves you, too.

640
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,000
Oh?

641
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:15,300
I got concerned when I heard
you played poker with her friends,

642
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,700
so I told her about your little problem.

643
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,000
You told her about my gambling problem.

644
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,400
Don't be mad, mama.

645
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,000
I just didn't want you slipping into old habits.

646
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,200
And Gabrielle was very concerned about you.

647
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,600
She knew.

648
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,700
I don't get it.

649
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,200
I've gone through all your yearbooks,

650
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,100
and you and Zach never went to school
with anybody named Dana.

651
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,500
He didn't say it was somebody we went to school with.

652
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,600
Well, did it sound like a relative?

653
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,800
He said Dana. It sounded like Dana.

654
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,700
Unless he was using a code, that's all I got.

655
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,500
Okay, give me a break here.
I'm just grasping at straws.

656
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,100
I'm sorry.
It's -- I'm worried about Zach.

657
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,700
It's just really creepy in there.

658
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,600
Can't we get him out?

659
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,900
Honey, it's up to his father.

660
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,000
Then I at least want to visit again.

661
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I don't think that's a good idea, either.

662
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,300
Why?

663
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,100
I just have a feeling.

664
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:35,200
Juanita was now more convinced than ever that her
treacherous daughter-in-law was having an affair,

665
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,200
but the question remained,

666
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,100
with whom?

667
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,800
And suddenly...

668
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:02,400
Juanita remembered it wasn't the men Gabrielle
talked to that she had to worry about.

669
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,100
Jordana, Maisy.

670
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:12,000
Here are the costumes, right on time.

671
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,100
Thank you, Lynette.

672
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,000
This is a bit awkward.

673
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,400
There has been an oversight with the programs.

674
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,800
Celia Bond is still credited with costumes.

675
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,000
They forgot to tell the printer.

676
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,600
Uh-huh.

677
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,600
incidentally, who is "they,"
as in "they forgot to tell the printer"?

678
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,800
That would be me.

679
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,600
I'm sorry,

680
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:46,000
but I was just so overworked this week, what
with all the script changes that you demanded.

681
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,400
Uh-huh. Well, these things happen.

682
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,900
Oh. Thanks. Be right back.

683
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,800
Would you do something with this?
It looks like roadkill.

684
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,900
Okay, lady, that's it.

685
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,500
I beg your pardon?

686
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,900
Maisy, we have kids the same age,

687
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:11,500
which means there are years ahead
of us having to deal with each other,

688
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:15,800
so instead of playing all these petty games,
why don't we put an end to this right now?

689
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,300
What are you saying?

690
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,600
Let's take it outside.

691
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,200
Let's take what outside?

692
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,400
Your sorry ass. We're throwing down.

693
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,500
You are crazy.

694
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,000
Just being practical.

695
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,900
Isn't it better to settle this once and for all,

696
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:33,100
rather than endure all this alpha mom crap
until our kids graduate, hmm?

697
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,300
Come on.

698
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,500
I'll even let you take the first shot.

699
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,000
I don't have time for this.

700
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Yeah, I didn't think so.

701
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,300
And just so you know, next spring,
when we do "Bambi,"

702
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,300
his mother's going to take a slug to the heart,

703
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,300
and you're going to like it!

704
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,700
The search for power begins when we're quite young.

705
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,500
As children, we're taught that the power of good

706
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,500
triumphs over the power of evil.

707
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,600
But as we get older,

708
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:22,900
we realize that nothing is ever that simple.

709
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,500
Traces of evil

710
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,800
always remain.
