1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,091
Previously on...

2
00:00:02,157 --> 00:00:04,859
Before we met, I was married
to someone else, but she died.

3
00:00:04,924 --> 00:00:06,314
<i>Edie's quest began.</i>
- What would you and Katherine

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,244
think about going camping?
- It's gonna be fun.

5
00:00:09,311 --> 00:00:12,952
<i>And Dave's plan moved forward.</i>
- This is gonna be fun.

6
00:00:13,035 --> 00:00:15,494
Were you serious about
wanting to go back to work?

7
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:18,390
<i>Lynette took a new path.</i>
- Now it's your turn.

8
00:00:18,456 --> 00:00:20,219
Tell Carlos he's fired.

9
00:00:20,285 --> 00:00:22,777
<i>But it was Carlos' boss...</i>

10
00:00:22,843 --> 00:00:26,257
He just kept telling me he loves her.
<i>- who was terminated.</i>

11
00:00:26,323 --> 00:00:28,007
I just wanted him to
stop talking.

12
00:00:31,923 --> 00:00:33,443
Come on, Gaby.

13
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,305
We're gonna be late.

14
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:41,440
<i>Gabrielle Solis</i>
<i>hated going to funerals</i>

15
00:00:41,523 --> 00:00:43,948
<i>for all sorts of reasons--</i>

16
00:00:44,013 --> 00:00:48,155
<i>Black was not her color...</i>

17
00:00:50,111 --> 00:00:52,993
<i>Crying depressed her...</i>

18
00:00:53,058 --> 00:00:56,021
<i>And lilies made her sneeze.</i>

19
00:00:58,902 --> 00:01:02,918
<i>Also, Gabrielle despised</i>
<i>any event...</i>

20
00:01:02,983 --> 00:01:07,304
<i>where she was not</i>
<i>the center of attention.</i>

21
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:12,871
<i>Luckily, at this funeral,</i>
<i>that would not be a problem.</i>

22
00:01:12,937 --> 00:01:15,266
Gaby,
I was hoping you'd be here.

23
00:01:15,332 --> 00:01:17,873
Everyone is saying that
you and Carlos were there,

24
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,389
you know,
when Maria killed Bradley.

25
00:01:22,454 --> 00:01:25,400
You know, Jody,
I really don't think this is

26
00:01:25,466 --> 00:01:28,574
the time or place
to discuss gory details.

27
00:01:28,639 --> 00:01:30,386
You're absolutely right.

28
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,961
Sit next to me at the wake.

29
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:40,424
I want to go home!

30
00:01:40,489 --> 00:01:43,418
Well, we just got here.
The funeral hasn't even started.

31
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,429
Yeah, well, I have a feeling
most of these vultures

32
00:01:46,494 --> 00:01:48,453
didn't come to pay
their respects to Brad.

33
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:50,655
They're just here to pump us
for dirt about his murder.

34
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,309
Okay, even so, I can't be seen
walking out of here early.

35
00:01:53,391 --> 00:01:54,506
These people are my coworkers.

36
00:01:54,507 --> 00:01:56,661
<i>Were</i> your coworkers.
Bradley fired you. Remember?

37
00:01:56,725 --> 00:01:58,846
Yeah, and Maria killed him
eight hours later.

38
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,917
He might not have told anyone,
so pipe down.

39
00:02:00,982 --> 00:02:02,390
We don't need people thinking

40
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:04,657
that we put the knife
in Maria's hand.

41
00:02:04,722 --> 00:02:06,858
Carlos.
Oh, hi.

42
00:02:06,923 --> 00:02:09,448
Gaby, this is, uh,
Owen Johnston, our C.E.O.

43
00:02:09,512 --> 00:02:11,180
Oh, hi.

44
00:02:11,245 --> 00:02:14,108
How do you do?
- I know it's an awkward time,

45
00:02:14,174 --> 00:02:16,601
but I must catch a plane
right after the service,

46
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:19,645
and I need to talk to you.
- About what?

47
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,668
Bradley called me
before he died.

48
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:24,807
He wanted to discuss
your job performance.

49
00:02:24,872 --> 00:02:27,641
Well, what did he say?

50
00:02:27,705 --> 00:02:29,032
Well, sadly,

51
00:02:29,096 --> 00:02:32,025
by the time I returned the call,
he was dead.

52
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:35,232
Really?

53
00:02:35,313 --> 00:02:37,644
But I think I know
what he wanted to tell me.

54
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:39,520
Oh?

55
00:02:39,588 --> 00:02:43,068
Based upon the big bonus
he fought for Carlos to have,

56
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:46,306
it's fairly obvious he was
going to recommend a promotion.

57
00:02:48,136 --> 00:02:50,095
That was my guess, too.

58
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,086
The terrible irony is
he didn't realize

59
00:02:52,153 --> 00:02:54,078
the job he was recommending

60
00:02:54,144 --> 00:02:56,166
would turn out
to be his own.

61
00:02:56,246 --> 00:02:58,463
Wait.

62
00:02:58,531 --> 00:03:00,260
So you're offering me

63
00:03:00,326 --> 00:03:02,997
Bradley's job
as President of the company?

64
00:03:03,063 --> 00:03:05,280
I can't think
of anyone better suited.

65
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,600
Now, of course, it would be
the same compensation package.

66
00:03:09,681 --> 00:03:12,367
Please.
Tell me you'll accept.

67
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:15,248
He sure will.

68
00:03:15,315 --> 00:03:17,773
The man has
a plane to catch.

69
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:20,234
I'd be honored
to step in for Bradley.

70
00:03:20,302 --> 00:03:22,809
Good. I'm glad
we've got that handled.

71
00:03:22,873 --> 00:03:25,803
Now we can focus on the sorrow
of this tragic day.

72
00:03:25,885 --> 00:03:27,568
Mm.

73
00:03:27,634 --> 00:03:30,708
The same compensation package!

74
00:03:30,773 --> 00:03:33,785
We're rich!

75
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:36,277
We are at a funeral.

76
00:03:36,344 --> 00:03:37,765
Please be quiet.

77
00:03:37,832 --> 00:03:39,419
Okay.

78
00:03:39,484 --> 00:03:43,466
<i>Yes, Gabrielle Solis hated</i>
<i>going to funerals...</i>

79
00:03:43,531 --> 00:03:46,914
And for god sakes,
stop smiling.

80
00:03:46,978 --> 00:03:51,205
<i>Mostly because</i>
<i>she couldn't pretend to be sad</i>

81
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:54,312
<i>when she wasn't.</i>

82
00:04:03,528 --> 00:04:07,509
<i>You can find them</i>
<i>on any sidewalk in any city...</i>

83
00:04:07,575 --> 00:04:10,148
<i>people with agendas--</i>

84
00:04:10,214 --> 00:04:13,175
<i>The woman</i>
<i>who calls up an old friend</i>

85
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:16,381
<i>because she wants</i>
<i>to borrow some cash...</i>

86
00:04:16,463 --> 00:04:19,636
<i>The man who takes his boss</i>
<i>to lunch</i>

87
00:04:19,701 --> 00:04:23,068
<i>because he wants</i>
<i>the corner office...</i>

88
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:25,902
<i>The girl who looks after</i>
<i>her uncle</i>

89
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,976
<i>because she wants</i>
<i>to be in the will...</i>

90
00:04:29,044 --> 00:04:33,364
<i>Yes, you can see these people</i>
<i>almost everywhere.</i>

91
00:04:33,448 --> 00:04:39,016
<i>Doing what they can to keep</i>
<i>their agendas hidden.</i>

92
00:04:40,797 --> 00:04:42,158
Hello.

93
00:04:42,222 --> 00:04:43,291
Hello.

94
00:04:43,372 --> 00:04:45,961
I need to look someone up
in your archives.

95
00:04:46,028 --> 00:04:49,167
It's a client, and he's, uh,
a bit of a smooth talker.

96
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,828
Just want to make sure that he's
not giving me the runaround.

97
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,447
Sure. What's his name?

98
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,310
David... Dash.

99
00:04:57,377 --> 00:05:01,131
All I've got here are
the obituaries.

100
00:05:01,197 --> 00:05:04,271
Anything else will take me
a couple of days.

101
00:05:04,335 --> 00:05:07,201
Fine.
Let's start with the obits.

102
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,354
No David...

103
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:11,489
That's probably
because he's not dead.

104
00:05:11,555 --> 00:05:13,304
Try Lila.

105
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,814
Lila Dash.

106
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:19,616
Killed three years ago,
car crash.

107
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:22,999
That was his wife.
Give me that one.

108
00:05:23,065 --> 00:05:24,309
Okay.

109
00:05:24,376 --> 00:05:26,982
You want Paige Dash, too?

110
00:05:27,048 --> 00:05:28,600
Paige?

111
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:31,060
Yeah, their daughter.

112
00:05:31,143 --> 00:05:33,392
"Paige Dash, 3 years old,

113
00:05:33,457 --> 00:05:35,659
daughter of Lila and David."

114
00:05:35,725 --> 00:05:39,609
It says here she died
in the same crash.

115
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,958
Who are we dishing?
I do hope it's not me.

116
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,683
No, we've already covered you.
We've moved on to my daughter, the thief.

117
00:06:03,748 --> 00:06:05,334
Oh, dear. What happened?

118
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,359
I'm missing
my small candy dish.

119
00:06:07,423 --> 00:06:11,050
I had it last night when
you guys were over for dinner,

120
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:13,075
because I remember
Orson admiring it.

121
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,844
Yes, I, uh...
remember that.

122
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:18,367
Anyway, Juanita went over
before breakfast

123
00:06:18,434 --> 00:06:20,393
to invite M.J.
to her birthday party,

124
00:06:20,457 --> 00:06:22,627
and, well,
candy plus Juanita.

125
00:06:22,692 --> 00:06:24,926
You don't have to be
Sherlock Holmes

126
00:06:24,992 --> 00:06:25,858
to crack this case.

127
00:06:25,859 --> 00:06:28,730
Well, we don't know that for sure.
I could have misplaced it.

128
00:06:28,796 --> 00:06:30,786
I'm sure
it'll turn up somewhere.

129
00:06:30,868 --> 00:06:32,826
Well... I'm off.

130
00:06:37,508 --> 00:06:41,386
Andrew, cancel my lunch.

131
00:06:41,453 --> 00:06:42,911
No, everything's fine.

132
00:06:42,977 --> 00:06:45,452
Your stepfather's
just misplaced a few things,

133
00:06:45,518 --> 00:06:48,317
and I need to find them.

134
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:52,946
Hey, Tom. No, still waiting.

135
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:55,635
Big surprise. They're running
behind at an ad agency.

136
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,167
So did any
of those other places call back?

137
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:02,935
Seriously?

138
00:07:03,001 --> 00:07:06,740
Six interviews and nothin'?

139
00:07:06,822 --> 00:07:09,913
Well, I should probably try
and keep my game face on here.

140
00:07:09,995 --> 00:07:13,022
I'll--I'll call you later.
I love you. Bye.

141
00:07:14,448 --> 00:07:16,227
Mariana!

142
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:19,237
I had a feeling that you'd be
interviewing for this!

143
00:07:19,303 --> 00:07:20,791
Hey, Nikki.

144
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:23,462
So I guess Anna should
be showing up any minute, too.

145
00:07:23,528 --> 00:07:26,360
No. You didn't hear?
She's pregnant.

146
00:07:26,426 --> 00:07:28,755
Oh, my God.
A kid and she just turned 30?

147
00:07:28,822 --> 00:07:30,779
Bye-bye, career.
- Oh, don't start.

148
00:07:30,845 --> 00:07:34,631
I'm gonna be 30 in 2 years.
I feel <i>so</i> old.

149
00:07:34,698 --> 00:07:36,686
Do you wanna know
what's even sadder?

150
00:07:36,751 --> 00:07:39,228
I just heard that
Veronica's looking for work,

151
00:07:39,294 --> 00:07:40,733
and she's 39.

152
00:07:40,814 --> 00:07:42,254
In this business?

153
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:45,199
After 35, they take you out back
and they shoot you in the face.

154
00:07:49,183 --> 00:07:50,896
Lynette Scavo.

155
00:07:50,962 --> 00:07:52,418
We're ready for you.

156
00:07:52,483 --> 00:07:53,761
Coming.

157
00:07:55,526 --> 00:07:56,951
Do me a favor.

158
00:07:57,016 --> 00:08:01,337
If you hear a gunshot,
tell my four kids I love them.

159
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,706
Now as you listen to the music,

160
00:08:10,772 --> 00:08:13,654
see what pops into your head.

161
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:17,392
What shapes
does it make you see?

162
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,415
What colors
are you thinking of?

163
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:21,714
Uh, why are the children
drawing with crayons?

164
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:23,673
They're supposed
to be making clay vases.

165
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,907
Well, I wanted
to do something more free.

166
00:08:25,974 --> 00:08:28,741
It's an imagination-building
exercise.

167
00:08:28,806 --> 00:08:31,672
Looks like a lot of scribbling to me.

168
00:08:31,753 --> 00:08:33,467
Susan,

169
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:37,111
these parents pay $22,000 a year
to send their kids here.

170
00:08:37,175 --> 00:08:39,977
As art teachers,
it's our job to give them

171
00:08:40,058 --> 00:08:42,580
something adorable
to put on their desks

172
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,688
to smile at while they write
those tuition checks.

173
00:08:45,754 --> 00:08:47,146
I mean,

174
00:08:47,213 --> 00:08:49,171
no one's gonna find

175
00:08:49,235 --> 00:08:52,407
this meaningless chicken scratch
adorable.

176
00:08:54,026 --> 00:08:56,016
Not yours, Mia.
Yours shows real promise.

177
00:08:58,106 --> 00:09:01,715
Jessie, you said that I could
plan the lesson today,

178
00:09:01,798 --> 00:09:04,939
and I think
this is valuable.

179
00:09:05,001 --> 00:09:06,929
I'm just trying
to be creative.

180
00:09:06,994 --> 00:09:08,368
Fine.

181
00:09:08,435 --> 00:09:10,506
But you know where I stand.

182
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,205
What's an "evalley-ation,"
Miss Susan?

183
00:09:16,271 --> 00:09:17,971
An evaluation?

184
00:09:18,036 --> 00:09:21,773
Well, that is when
someone judges your work

185
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,381
and gives you a grade on it.

186
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:27,489
But don't worry.
I'm not doing that today.

187
00:09:27,555 --> 00:09:29,609
No,
they're doing it to <i>you.</i>

188
00:09:29,675 --> 00:09:31,972
Who?

189
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,497
Miss Jessie
and Principal Hobson.

190
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,986
I heard them talking.

191
00:09:36,052 --> 00:09:38,154
Oh, right. That's not
till later this year.

192
00:09:38,222 --> 00:09:41,150
No, it's this week.
I hope you don't get fired.

193
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,171
The lady
with the purple sweater

194
00:09:43,254 --> 00:09:47,299
argued with Miss Jessie
like you did, and she's gone.

195
00:09:47,365 --> 00:09:50,438
The lady
with the purple sweater?

196
00:09:50,505 --> 00:09:53,921
I never learned her name.
She wasn't here that long.

197
00:09:53,984 --> 00:09:55,912
She was creative, too.

198
00:09:58,533 --> 00:09:59,989
All right, everyone.

199
00:10:00,054 --> 00:10:02,222
Grab some clay.
We're making vases.

200
00:10:03,841 --> 00:10:06,768
Darling, I'm home.

201
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:09,504
Oh, and I'm famished!

202
00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:11,560
What are we having for dinner?

203
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,748
How about a confession?

204
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,344
Sit down.

205
00:10:29,626 --> 00:10:31,179
Start talking.

206
00:10:31,244 --> 00:10:33,672
What do you want me to say?

207
00:10:33,739 --> 00:10:35,842
I want you to explain to me

208
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:37,835
why this insanity
is still going on.

209
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,792
When you stole
that tape recorder,

210
00:10:39,858 --> 00:10:41,785
you said it was
a one time thing,

211
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:44,034
an impulsive act
of revenge.

212
00:10:44,116 --> 00:10:47,756
It was, at first.

213
00:10:47,823 --> 00:10:50,461
But then...

214
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:54,297
I know it sounds odd, but...

215
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:57,956
it started giving me
a thrill.

216
00:10:58,022 --> 00:10:59,898
A thrill?

217
00:10:59,981 --> 00:11:04,998
Stealing a ceramic duck
gives you a thrill?

218
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,860
It's hard to explain.

219
00:11:06,927 --> 00:11:08,851
Well, maybe you'd feel
more comfortable

220
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:10,373
talking to a professional.

221
00:11:10,438 --> 00:11:13,238
A psychiatrist?

222
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:16,719
Good heavens.
Bree, I'm not crazy.

223
00:11:20,477 --> 00:11:22,436
Look, I'll stop.

224
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,620
I'll--I'll tell everyone
I'm sorry

225
00:11:24,686 --> 00:11:26,514
and return everything.

226
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,846
You will do no such thing.
From this moment on,

227
00:11:28,913 --> 00:11:31,873
you are forbidden from entering
any of our friends' homes.

228
00:11:31,954 --> 00:11:35,046
But how are we gonna
get these things back?

229
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,896
I'll take care of it.

230
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:54,810
I'm so glad you could make it.

231
00:11:55,811 --> 00:11:58,141
I know I sprung this on
you at the last minute.

232
00:11:58,142 --> 00:11:58,821
Oh, actually,

233
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:01,781
I was just gonna watch a DVD
and order some takeout,

234
00:12:01,849 --> 00:12:03,805
so I'm looking forward
to a home-cooked meal.

235
00:12:03,887 --> 00:12:05,327
Oh, well, keep looking,

236
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:08,677
'cause I don't cook,
and Shanghai Panda delivers.

237
00:12:08,743 --> 00:12:10,636
Oh. Well, that'll be fine.

238
00:12:10,701 --> 00:12:12,156
You know, Susan,

239
00:12:12,222 --> 00:12:15,328
I was a little surprised
to get your invitation.

240
00:12:15,395 --> 00:12:16,833
Oh, well, you know,

241
00:12:16,917 --> 00:12:20,248
I just think that school
is such a formal environment,

242
00:12:20,313 --> 00:12:23,148
and I thought it would be nice
if we could let loose

243
00:12:23,229 --> 00:12:27,500
and drink a little wine,
get to know each other.

244
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,541
Oh, my gosh.

245
00:12:29,607 --> 00:12:32,196
What?
- Look at you.

246
00:12:32,263 --> 00:12:34,187
You're like that schoolmarm
in the movies

247
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:38,006
who lets down her hair
and va-va-va-voom.

248
00:12:39,464 --> 00:12:42,425
I've never gotten
a va-va-va-voom before.

249
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:45,225
Thanks. You look nice, too.

250
00:12:45,292 --> 00:12:48,399
Oh, please. I didn't even
get a chance to change.

251
00:12:48,465 --> 00:12:50,666
My ex was late
picking up M.J.,

252
00:12:50,732 --> 00:12:53,401
which is insane, 'cause he lives
right across the street.

253
00:12:53,468 --> 00:12:55,424
Your ex lives
across the street?

254
00:12:55,491 --> 00:12:58,500
He decided to shack up
with my best friend.

255
00:12:58,565 --> 00:13:00,717
And people wonder why
I'm through with men.

256
00:13:02,611 --> 00:13:05,040
So what are we toasting to?

257
00:13:05,121 --> 00:13:07,742
Getting to know each other better.

258
00:13:07,807 --> 00:13:09,571
Oh, napkins.

259
00:13:11,255 --> 00:13:13,958
I'll drink to that.

260
00:13:17,034 --> 00:13:19,120
Oh, hey, Mike. Come on in.

261
00:13:19,186 --> 00:13:22,100
I went a little crazy
at the camping supply store.

262
00:13:22,165 --> 00:13:24,869
Hey, check this out.
I got Katherine her own lantern.

263
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:26,891
I know she was
a little worried

264
00:13:26,957 --> 00:13:29,385
about finding the latrine
in the middle of the night.

265
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,586
Uh, actually, that's,
uh, why I came by.

266
00:13:31,652 --> 00:13:33,578
Katherine sort of bailed.

267
00:13:33,644 --> 00:13:37,785
Bailed? You mean she's not
going camping with us?

268
00:13:37,852 --> 00:13:40,149
Ah, she's really sorry,

269
00:13:40,215 --> 00:13:42,141
but she's gotta
get her taxes done.

270
00:13:42,205 --> 00:13:44,973
So Katherine is
blowing us off for taxes.

271
00:13:45,055 --> 00:13:49,295
Also, I think she's worried
she'd just be a third wheel.

272
00:13:49,377 --> 00:13:51,026
What? Oh, come on.

273
00:13:51,092 --> 00:13:53,957
I mean, this trip is as much
about her as it is about us.

274
00:13:54,022 --> 00:13:55,265
Tell her she's gotta come.

275
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:58,086
First of all, I don't <i>tell</i>
Katherine to do anything.

276
00:13:58,151 --> 00:14:00,077
And it'll be better
with just us guys.

277
00:14:00,142 --> 00:14:02,197
We can burp and scratch
to our heart's content.

278
00:14:02,263 --> 00:14:03,654
Besides,
Katherine was never

279
00:14:03,722 --> 00:14:05,775
part of the original plan
anyway.

280
00:14:05,842 --> 00:14:07,978
No, she wasn't.

281
00:14:08,044 --> 00:14:10,405
All right, I'll, uh,
see you Saturday.

282
00:14:10,471 --> 00:14:13,111
Yeah.

283
00:14:28,018 --> 00:14:30,496
You're not listening to me.

284
00:14:30,561 --> 00:14:33,294
I'm not saying
I'm giving up on love.

285
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,095
I'm saying
I've already given up.

286
00:14:36,161 --> 00:14:38,085
No. I-I will not let you.

287
00:14:38,151 --> 00:14:41,419
You are too smart and funny
and adorable.

288
00:14:41,485 --> 00:14:43,443
Am I?

289
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:46,454
It's been a long time since I've
been complimented like that.

290
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,540
Well, I mean it.

291
00:14:48,608 --> 00:14:51,340
Anyone would be lucky
to have you.

292
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:54,109
You are a catch.

293
00:14:58,609 --> 00:15:01,442
Jeez.
How did it get so late?

294
00:15:01,508 --> 00:15:04,274
Is there a school policy
on showing up to work drunk?

295
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,011
It's frowned upon.

296
00:15:07,075 --> 00:15:09,438
Oh.

297
00:15:09,502 --> 00:15:11,799
I've had the best time
tonight.

298
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:13,631
Oh, me, too.

299
00:15:13,696 --> 00:15:17,207
You know, I think we should
probably keep th between us.

300
00:15:17,273 --> 00:15:20,752
We don't want people talking at work.
- It'll be our little secret.

301
00:15:24,461 --> 00:15:25,851
Ohh.

302
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:29,333
So... You think you might
wanna do this again sometime?

303
00:15:29,397 --> 00:15:31,857
It's a date.

304
00:15:37,217 --> 00:15:41,036
Va-va-va-voom!

305
00:15:47,883 --> 00:15:51,798
S-so what kind of kiss
are we talking about?

306
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,902
A regular kiss on the mouth...

307
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:56,669
that lasted a little longer than
I thought it would.

308
00:15:56,737 --> 00:15:58,968
So was it a good, old-fashioned
American kiss

309
00:15:59,034 --> 00:16:01,834
or are we talking the infinitely
superior French variety?

310
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:04,019
Mm...

311
00:16:04,086 --> 00:16:07,274
Okay, I'm probably just blowing
this out of proportion.

312
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:10,575
I mean, she never even said
anything about being gay.

313
00:16:10,641 --> 00:16:13,246
Well, that doesn't make
any difference. Right, Lee?

314
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,719
Why ask me?

315
00:16:14,801 --> 00:16:16,710
Aside from
the occasional parade,

316
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:19,414
gay men rarely interact
with lesbians in the wild.

317
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,889
Susan, if you're not sure
what she meant by it,

318
00:16:21,956 --> 00:16:23,597
why don't you just
have a talk with her?

319
00:16:23,598 --> 00:16:25,598
Oh, that would be way
too awkward. She's my boss.

320
00:16:25,664 --> 00:16:27,087
She's your boss?

321
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,207
Let her kiss you again,
then sue her.

322
00:16:29,757 --> 00:16:32,413
Okay, we're gonna
figure this out for you.

323
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:34,274
Were her eyes open or shut?

324
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,735
I don't know.

325
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,535
Well, how many seconds
did the kiss last?

326
00:16:39,601 --> 00:16:41,996
I don't remember.

327
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:43,728
Oh, for God sakes.

328
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,221
Was it this... mm.

329
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:47,807
Or was it this...

330
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,983
The second one?

331
00:16:58,846 --> 00:17:01,111
Congratulations.
You're now dating a lesbian.

332
00:17:01,177 --> 00:17:03,879
See you at the parade.

333
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,076
Hey, Gaby?

334
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:10,822
I'll see ya.

335
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:13,704
I wanted to ask you something.
Feel free to say no.

336
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:16,730
Oh, Honey, I'm flattered, but I
only did that to help Susan out.

337
00:17:16,812 --> 00:17:18,836
Yeah, this isn't about that.

338
00:17:18,902 --> 00:17:22,411
Um, I wanted to say I heard
about Carlos' big promotion.

339
00:17:22,478 --> 00:17:24,436
Congratulations.

340
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,928
Thank you. I mean,
it's sad how it happened,

341
00:17:26,994 --> 00:17:28,949
but, you know,
when opportunity knocks,

342
00:17:29,017 --> 00:17:30,698
you gotta answer the door, right?

343
00:17:30,699 --> 00:17:33,143
Absolutely. Now you
know I'm looking for work?

344
00:17:33,209 --> 00:17:35,845
Oh, yeah. How's that going?
- Not great.

345
00:17:35,911 --> 00:17:37,837
See, while I was working
at Scavo's,

346
00:17:37,902 --> 00:17:41,381
I got seven years older,
which is weird,

347
00:17:41,446 --> 00:17:44,375
seeing as how all the C.E.O.s
got seven years younger.

348
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,386
The bottom line is,
no one wants to hire someone

349
00:17:47,452 --> 00:17:50,752
who could have made out
with their dad on prom night.

350
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,744
Anyway, I hear Carlos

351
00:17:52,825 --> 00:17:55,448
is looking for
a new Director of Marketing.

352
00:17:55,513 --> 00:17:58,734
Think you could put in
a good word for me?

353
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,547
Oh. Uh...

354
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:02,375
I don't know.

355
00:18:02,443 --> 00:18:05,112
Y-you don't know?

356
00:18:05,178 --> 00:18:07,571
Well, I thought
you did advertising.

357
00:18:07,639 --> 00:18:11,181
Yes, I helped advertise what
companies decided to market.

358
00:18:11,247 --> 00:18:12,703
It's the same thing.

359
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,937
Come on.
You know I'd be great.

360
00:18:15,002 --> 00:18:16,653
I guess.

361
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:19,485
You guess? Gaby...

362
00:18:19,552 --> 00:18:21,784
Look, Lynette, you're my friend,
and I love you,

363
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,796
but as far as knowing if you're
any good at your job...

364
00:18:24,861 --> 00:18:27,790
Enough with the shrugging.

365
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,769
Come on.
- You're putting me in a tough spot.

366
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:33,021
Carlos is under
a lot of pressure now,

367
00:18:33,103 --> 00:18:35,012
and he's not really
in a position

368
00:18:35,095 --> 00:18:38,492
To be taking big risks.
- You think I'm a big risk?

369
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:40,597
Well...

370
00:18:40,663 --> 00:18:42,185
Okay, that's it.

371
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,304
Four shrugs. I'm out.

372
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,086
Thanks for your help.

373
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:48,091
Ugh.

374
00:18:52,675 --> 00:18:54,601
Yeah, just follow
the road as it curves.

375
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,093
We're the second house on the left.
Okay, bye.

376
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,926
Oh, place looks great, babe.
Thanks for doing this.

377
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:02,630
It's all part of being
the President's wife.

378
00:19:02,696 --> 00:19:06,289
So tell me about your new hire.
She's gonna be your number two?

379
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:08,280
Yeah, and I'm lucky
to get her.

380
00:19:08,344 --> 00:19:10,270
Smart as a whip,
Harvard M.B.A.

381
00:19:10,336 --> 00:19:12,294
I've probably
mentioned her before.

382
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,476
Lucy Blackburn?

383
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:16,552
Maybe I'll go
put on some music.

384
00:19:16,617 --> 00:19:18,056
Lucy Blackburn?

385
00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:20,049
Please tell me
it's a coincidence that

386
00:19:20,131 --> 00:19:22,460
your new V.P. has the same
name as your ex-girlfriend.

387
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:23,561
She wasn't my girlfriend.

388
00:19:23,627 --> 00:19:25,957
We were roommates.
We shared an apartment.

389
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,535
You told me you slept with her.
- Well, it was a small apartment.

390
00:19:29,617 --> 00:19:32,757
Come on. It was a casual thing,
and it was a million years ago.

391
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:35,752
I don't care! Why couldn't you
have told me this

392
00:19:35,816 --> 00:19:38,246
<i>before</i> she's about to appear
on my doorstep?

393
00:19:38,328 --> 00:19:42,505
I wanted to... but you were
always next to something sharp.

394
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:45,336
Gaby, I am in over my head
with this new job,

395
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:47,847
and I need Lucy's help.
Please don't be jealous.

396
00:19:47,911 --> 00:19:50,987
I'm not jealous.
It's just... you can't hire her.

397
00:19:51,054 --> 00:19:53,205
I'm Mrs. President,
and I get a vote.

398
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:58,078
There she is. Now please,
I'm begging you...

399
00:19:58,143 --> 00:20:00,572
Well, you can beg
all you want.

400
00:20:00,638 --> 00:20:02,562
I am not on board with this!

401
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,862
Hey, Lucy!

402
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:06,208
Hey!

403
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:09,413
Hi. I'm Lucy.
You must be Gabrielle.

404
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:11,485
You can call me Gaby.

405
00:20:11,552 --> 00:20:13,202
Come on in!

406
00:20:16,878 --> 00:20:18,333
I'm on board.

407
00:20:22,515 --> 00:20:24,569
I got a bead on Charlie Fields
for C.F.O.

408
00:20:24,636 --> 00:20:27,081
Charlie Fields? There's no way
you're gonna get him.

409
00:20:27,145 --> 00:20:29,573
He's the number two guy
at Brewster and Parent.

410
00:20:29,637 --> 00:20:31,498
Relax. It'll take
some maneuvering,

411
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,894
but I'll make it happen.
- How?

412
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,546
Carlos,
you're the President.

413
00:20:35,612 --> 00:20:37,716
It's best you don't know where the
bodies are buried.

414
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,927
Ah.

415
00:20:38,994 --> 00:20:41,761
Well, speak of the devil.

416
00:20:41,826 --> 00:20:43,752
If you'll excuse me,

417
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:46,246
I have some professional ethics
that need compromising.

418
00:20:48,107 --> 00:20:51,003
Wow. Now I know
why you wanted to hire her.

419
00:20:51,069 --> 00:20:54,694
She's a force of nature.
- Mm, you should see her close a deal.

420
00:20:54,761 --> 00:20:58,224
I'll bet. Ahh. So were you
surprised when the door opened?

421
00:20:58,306 --> 00:20:59,189
What do you mean?

422
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,735
Well, she's obviously
stopped counting calories

423
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,727
Since the last time
you saw her.

424
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:06,236
No, she looks about the same.

425
00:21:06,302 --> 00:21:08,729
What? But...

426
00:21:08,793 --> 00:21:11,336
you two used to have sex.

427
00:21:11,401 --> 00:21:13,147
Yeah. So?

428
00:21:13,213 --> 00:21:15,171
So don't get me wrong--
she's attractive.

429
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:17,163
It's just...
she's not really your type.

430
00:21:17,245 --> 00:21:18,535
Your type is skinny model.

431
00:21:18,536 --> 00:21:20,917
Okay, so you're not
gonna see her on a runway.

432
00:21:20,983 --> 00:21:23,344
Except maybe at an airport.
- Gaby!

433
00:21:23,411 --> 00:21:26,616
You think I'm that shallow,
that all I go by is looks?

434
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:29,723
Yeah, I thought that was
something we had in common.

435
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:33,397
Look, Lucy is brilliant
and witty

436
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,099
and has more confidence
than anybody I've ever met.

437
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:40,566
That type of personality
can be very seductive.

438
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:41,877
Ahh!

439
00:21:41,944 --> 00:21:44,031
Someone light me a cigar.
- You got him?

440
00:21:44,114 --> 00:21:46,541
I find poaching is easier
when you lead with,

441
00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:49,067
"we'll double your salary."

442
00:21:49,132 --> 00:21:50,428
Sizzle me.

443
00:21:51,932 --> 00:21:53,696
Ah, there it is,

444
00:21:53,763 --> 00:21:57,064
that thrill you get from taking
something that's not yours.

445
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:04,964
Hey, are you still looking
for a Marketing Director?

446
00:22:05,045 --> 00:22:06,954
I have a friend

447
00:22:07,036 --> 00:22:10,369
that I would love to see
working with you two.

448
00:22:18,982 --> 00:22:20,568
No problem, Bree.

449
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:22,930
We buy aspirin by the pound
in this house.

450
00:22:22,994 --> 00:22:24,581
I'll get you some.

451
00:22:24,646 --> 00:22:26,816
Ah, you're a lifesaver!

452
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,567
Yes, we have
lots of screwdrivers.

453
00:22:34,635 --> 00:22:37,078
What kind do you need?
Phillips head?

454
00:22:37,143 --> 00:22:39,443
Yes, that would be lovely.

455
00:22:42,068 --> 00:22:44,674
I don't have cumin,
but I probably have cinnamon.

456
00:22:44,741 --> 00:22:46,665
Oh.
Close enough.

457
00:22:50,616 --> 00:22:53,253
Yeah, no problem.
Two eggs coming right up.

458
00:22:55,976 --> 00:22:59,599
Oh! Wait.

459
00:22:59,664 --> 00:23:02,835
I made omelets this morning,
so I'm all out.

460
00:23:02,902 --> 00:23:06,511
Oh, that's all right.
I'll just go to the store.

461
00:23:06,577 --> 00:23:08,776
Where did that come from?

462
00:23:10,267 --> 00:23:13,324
Oh. I don't know,
but it's awfully cute.

463
00:23:13,406 --> 00:23:16,127
Unbelievable.

464
00:23:17,649 --> 00:23:20,627
Juanita,
get your butt down here.

465
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:22,958
Why are you, uh,
calling Juanita?

466
00:23:23,023 --> 00:23:24,948
To find out what
McCluskey's sleeping Mexican

467
00:23:25,016 --> 00:23:26,794
is doing in my house.

468
00:23:26,876 --> 00:23:30,308
That's not yours?
- No. Why would you think that?

469
00:23:30,404 --> 00:23:34,030
Oh! Uh, I don't know.
But, you know, there it is.

470
00:23:34,095 --> 00:23:36,054
It's been sitting
on McCluskey's porch for years.

471
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:38,320
I keep telling her
how racist it is.

472
00:23:38,386 --> 00:23:40,877
First the candy bowl
and now this?

473
00:23:40,944 --> 00:23:43,330
How many times have I
told you not to steal?

474
00:23:43,331 --> 00:23:44,391
I didn't take that.

475
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:46,949
Juanita, you play with it every
time we go by Mrs. McCluskey's.

476
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,940
Now either
tell me the truth,

477
00:23:49,023 --> 00:23:51,303
or I'm gonna cancel
your birthday party.

478
00:23:51,387 --> 00:23:54,849
I am telling you the truth!
- That's it. Party's over!

479
00:23:54,929 --> 00:23:57,615
Gaby! Aren't you being
a little harsh?

480
00:23:57,698 --> 00:23:59,656
I mean, perhaps she didn't
take it.

481
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,120
Well, then how else
did it get here?

482
00:24:03,185 --> 00:24:05,694
Maybe <i>she</i> did it.

483
00:24:07,183 --> 00:24:09,918
Juanita!

484
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,568
Whenever my children stole,

485
00:24:11,635 --> 00:24:14,062
I sent them to bed
without any supper.

486
00:24:14,127 --> 00:24:16,795
Just a thought.

487
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,004
Orson?

488
00:24:25,068 --> 00:24:27,625
Orson!

489
00:24:27,707 --> 00:24:31,009
Orson! Orson!

490
00:24:31,075 --> 00:24:32,871
Orson!

491
00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:34,587
No!

492
00:24:34,653 --> 00:24:37,356
Hi, Bree!
- What were you doing at Bob and Lee's?

493
00:24:37,421 --> 00:24:39,880
Well, they invited me over
for coffee.

494
00:24:39,964 --> 00:24:43,426
After I told you to stay out
of the neighbors' houses?

495
00:24:43,508 --> 00:24:46,162
You stole again, didn't you?

496
00:24:46,228 --> 00:24:48,331
No. No, I didn't.

497
00:24:48,397 --> 00:24:50,355
What are you hiding
behind your back?

498
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:52,752
Nothing.

499
00:24:52,817 --> 00:24:54,338
It's mine.

500
00:24:54,404 --> 00:24:55,989
You're telling me

501
00:24:56,056 --> 00:25:00,069
you own a mug with a picture
of Bernadette Peters in "Gypsy"?

502
00:25:03,957 --> 00:25:06,902
This is quite a résumé you got here.
- Oh.

503
00:25:06,968 --> 00:25:08,423
Northwestern, huh?

504
00:25:08,489 --> 00:25:09,897
Yep. Thank you.

505
00:25:09,979 --> 00:25:12,228
So, Lynette...
- Mm-hmm?

506
00:25:12,295 --> 00:25:13,749
How old are you?

507
00:25:13,815 --> 00:25:15,676
Um...

508
00:25:15,742 --> 00:25:17,166
Mr. Vivinetto,

509
00:25:17,232 --> 00:25:19,807
I'm not obligated to answer.
It's the law.

510
00:25:19,808 --> 00:25:20,645
Right, right.

511
00:25:20,711 --> 00:25:22,863
I was only asking 'cause
I-I also went to Northwestern,

512
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,894
and I thought maybe we
crossed paths there.

513
00:25:24,895 --> 00:25:25,358
Oh.

514
00:25:25,439 --> 00:25:28,126
What--what year
did you graduate?

515
00:25:28,207 --> 00:25:31,168
Well, if I was
dumb enough to answer that,

516
00:25:31,235 --> 00:25:33,127
I never would've
gotten into Northwestern.

517
00:25:33,193 --> 00:25:36,058
I-I understand, but, uh,
I'm gonna be honest here.

518
00:25:36,139 --> 00:25:38,762
We have certain accounts that
cater to a specific demographic.

519
00:25:38,844 --> 00:25:42,210
Okay, I'm gonna stop you.
What is this obsession with age?

520
00:25:42,275 --> 00:25:44,477
I am a vital woman
with passion

521
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:47,877
and a library of knowledge
when it comes to this industry.

522
00:25:47,957 --> 00:25:50,547
Why doesn't at count for something?
- What I'm saying is,

523
00:25:50,613 --> 00:25:53,056
we just landed the Cosgrove's
Revitalizing Serum account.

524
00:25:53,123 --> 00:25:56,960
It's an antiwrinkle cream,
and I need someone more mature

525
00:25:57,042 --> 00:25:59,776
who can identify with the--
- I'm 54.

526
00:26:06,242 --> 00:26:07,875
He didn't even flinch.

527
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,401
I said I was 54,
and he bought it.

528
00:26:10,466 --> 00:26:13,411
There was not a "wow,
you look great for your age!"

529
00:26:13,478 --> 00:26:15,402
Not even a courtesy gasp.

530
00:26:15,468 --> 00:26:19,108
Look, you got the job.
You're making $80,000 a year.

531
00:26:19,175 --> 00:26:21,715
What--what does it matter?

532
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,115
It matters because I'm only 43,
and I look like I'm 39.

533
00:26:25,181 --> 00:26:28,693
You're 43? But I'm--
I'm 2 years younger than you,

534
00:26:28,757 --> 00:26:31,201
and I--
- Nobody cares how old you are, Tom.

535
00:26:34,002 --> 00:26:35,717
Hey.

536
00:26:35,782 --> 00:26:38,922
Great news! You got the job!
- Yeah! How'd you hear about it?

537
00:26:38,989 --> 00:26:42,359
Hear about it? Honey, I did it.
I talked to Carlos. You're in.

538
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:42,841
Oh. Wow.

539
00:26:42,907 --> 00:26:44,456
<i>That</i> job.

540
00:26:44,524 --> 00:26:46,919
Um... I don't know
what to say.

541
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,217
Say, "how do I thank you,
greatest friend in the world?

542
00:26:49,283 --> 00:26:50,322
What's your birthstone?"

543
00:26:50,323 --> 00:26:52,228
Well, thank you, greatest friend,

544
00:26:52,293 --> 00:26:54,722
but I just accepted
another job.

545
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:57,180
Well, un-accept it.
You have to take this job.

546
00:26:57,263 --> 00:27:00,597
It's essential that you be there.
- Why?

547
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:02,864
Because it's
a great opportunity.

548
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:05,826
I'm confused. Before, you didn't
even want to talk to him.

549
00:27:05,894 --> 00:27:08,028
You weren't even sure
I was good.

550
00:27:08,095 --> 00:27:11,299
Yeah. Yes, and then
I went home and thought,

551
00:27:11,366 --> 00:27:14,375
what a horrible thing to say
to such a dear, dear friend

552
00:27:14,441 --> 00:27:16,902
who's probably
really, really good at her job.

553
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,666
So...

554
00:27:18,732 --> 00:27:21,532
I said, "Carlos,
you have to hire Lynette."

555
00:27:21,596 --> 00:27:24,915
I... don't know.

556
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,546
Well, he'd have to match
my current offer.

557
00:27:30,612 --> 00:27:33,250
Yeah, okay.
What are they paying?

558
00:27:33,316 --> 00:27:34,933
$100,000 a year.

559
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:37,864
I don't think
that'll be a problem.

560
00:27:37,946 --> 00:27:39,789
Oh.

561
00:27:39,855 --> 00:27:42,590
By the way, you're gonna
be reporting to this woman Lucy.

562
00:27:42,658 --> 00:27:44,615
She's a real star,

563
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,944
so you're gonna wanna
keep an eye on her.

564
00:27:50,053 --> 00:27:53,161
Decaf soy latte--
your favorite.

565
00:27:53,227 --> 00:27:54,846
Thanks.

566
00:27:54,911 --> 00:27:57,859
I was thinking about the other night...
- Mm, me, too.

567
00:27:57,924 --> 00:28:00,352
Maybe Friday you could
come over to my place,

568
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:03,089
and we could hang out or...

569
00:28:03,154 --> 00:28:08,154
You know, I-I think you may have
gotten the wrong impression.

570
00:28:09,986 --> 00:28:12,671
I'm not...

571
00:28:12,754 --> 00:28:15,116
into women.

572
00:28:15,182 --> 00:28:18,111
Mm-hmm.

573
00:28:18,176 --> 00:28:20,571
Nice boots.

574
00:28:22,565 --> 00:28:25,267
I thought
it was gonna rain.

575
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:27,226
Okay, um...

576
00:28:27,292 --> 00:28:29,363
I'm not gay.

577
00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:32,973
Mm-hmm, then what was all that
stuff about the other night?

578
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,309
The--the touching my knee?
The "oh, you look so sexy"?

579
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:38,300
The good night kiss?

580
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:40,356
Oh, we, that kiss
was all you.

581
00:28:40,437 --> 00:28:42,152
Oh, it was?

582
00:28:42,219 --> 00:28:44,190
I seem to remember you being
there and not pulling away.

583
00:28:44,191 --> 00:28:44,985
Well, that's because--

584
00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:47,526
Why didn't you say something then?
- Because I--

585
00:28:47,591 --> 00:28:50,051
Cause you're tired of living a lie.
- What?

586
00:28:50,117 --> 00:28:52,852
I was you
20 years ago, Susan.

587
00:28:52,918 --> 00:28:54,534
You're obviously worried

588
00:28:54,618 --> 00:28:57,448
there's a lesbian inside of you
trying to get out.

589
00:28:57,516 --> 00:28:59,941
Actually, I'm more worried
about the lesbian

590
00:29:00,007 --> 00:29:03,050
that's outside of me
trying to get in.

591
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:07,406
Um, can we just teach the class
and talk about this later?

592
00:29:07,472 --> 00:29:10,336
Fine.

593
00:29:12,845 --> 00:29:15,580
Shouldn't you
be doing your taxes?

594
00:29:15,646 --> 00:29:17,571
Oh! God, Dave!
You scared me.

595
00:29:17,636 --> 00:29:19,595
Oh, sorry about that.
- Oh.

596
00:29:19,661 --> 00:29:21,620
What's this I hear
about you not going camping?

597
00:29:21,684 --> 00:29:24,113
Oh, well, it is
that time of year,

598
00:29:24,177 --> 00:29:27,221
and I got all these receipts
to go through.

599
00:29:27,287 --> 00:29:30,265
I gotta say,
I'm mighty disappointed.

600
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,255
Please.
I'm sure you're relieved

601
00:29:32,321 --> 00:29:34,279
there won't be a girl
tagging along

602
00:29:34,344 --> 00:29:35,544
to spoil all your macho fun.

603
00:29:35,545 --> 00:29:37,388
Well, see, now that's
where you're wrong.

604
00:29:37,453 --> 00:29:39,411
I mostly saw this trip

605
00:29:39,476 --> 00:29:42,360
As a chance to get to
know <i>you</i> better.

606
00:29:42,361 --> 00:29:42,924
Me? Why?

607
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,078
Katherine, the truth is,
I don't have a lot of friends.

608
00:29:45,143 --> 00:29:47,911
Maybe that's why Mike's
become so important to me.

609
00:29:47,993 --> 00:29:49,900
And ever since
you came into his life,

610
00:29:49,984 --> 00:29:51,891
well, I can see the change.

611
00:29:51,973 --> 00:29:54,060
He's so much happier,
so much more relaxed.

612
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,553
You've given him
this sort of inner peace.

613
00:29:58,449 --> 00:30:00,875
I just thought
it would be cool

614
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:04,598
to become buddies with the woman
who did that for my friend.

615
00:30:04,664 --> 00:30:07,089
Well, when you put it
that way...

616
00:30:07,154 --> 00:30:10,051
So you'll go camping
with us?

617
00:30:12,286 --> 00:30:14,211
I'll go start packing
my fleece.

618
00:30:14,277 --> 00:30:17,044
Fantastic.

619
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:19,375
Dave?

620
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,986
Do you really think

621
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,785
I've made that much
of a difference in Mike's life?

622
00:30:25,852 --> 00:30:26,934
Oh, absolutely.

623
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,234
If he ever lost you...

624
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,289
it would destroy him.

625
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:36,017
Okay, class, let's see how

626
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:38,009
our animals of Africa drawings
are going.

627
00:30:38,074 --> 00:30:40,923
Oh, Emma,
this is beautiful.

628
00:30:40,987 --> 00:30:43,238
Emma drew a gazelle.
Isn't she pretty?

629
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:46,653
Zachary,
is that a rhinoceros?

630
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:51,009
Wow! He looks so big
and strong.

631
00:30:51,074 --> 00:30:52,692
I love rhinos.

632
00:30:52,773 --> 00:30:55,670
Do you, Susan?
Do you really?

633
00:30:55,737 --> 00:30:56,949
Excuse me?

634
00:30:57,014 --> 00:30:59,718
I'm just saying,
if you were on safari

635
00:30:59,782 --> 00:31:02,420
and you saw a sleek gazelle

636
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:05,837
next to a grunting,
sweaty rhino...

637
00:31:09,384 --> 00:31:12,813
Your eye wouldn't
go straight to the gazelle?

638
00:31:12,879 --> 00:31:14,675
Uh...

639
00:31:16,603 --> 00:31:21,490
Though I would definitely
appreciate the...

640
00:31:21,556 --> 00:31:23,627
beauty of the gazelle,

641
00:31:23,692 --> 00:31:28,886
uh, if I was going to take
a trip to Africa...

642
00:31:28,952 --> 00:31:32,366
I would be more excited
to see the rhinos.

643
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:34,115
I like rhinos, too.

644
00:31:34,213 --> 00:31:35,766
Yes, we know, Jeffrey.

645
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:38,129
We've all seen you
playing hopscotch at recess.

646
00:31:38,212 --> 00:31:40,363
Are you gonna tell me

647
00:31:40,429 --> 00:31:42,353
that you've never had
any experience with gazelles?

648
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,717
Not even in college?

649
00:31:44,781 --> 00:31:46,093
No.

650
00:31:46,175 --> 00:31:49,282
And... I was on
on the softball team.

651
00:31:51,306 --> 00:31:54,269
Look, Susan,
why don't you just say it?

652
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:57,247
This particular gazelle

653
00:31:57,313 --> 00:31:59,238
isn't young enough for you,

654
00:31:59,303 --> 00:32:01,729
and you don't want
to hurt my feelings.

655
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:05,370
That is not true, and I think
we are dangerously close

656
00:32:05,436 --> 00:32:07,538
to no longer
speaking in metaphor.

657
00:32:07,605 --> 00:32:10,032
Well, then why were you
so interested in me

658
00:32:10,098 --> 00:32:11,586
in the first place?

659
00:32:11,652 --> 00:32:14,080
Why did you ask me
to your house?

660
00:32:14,145 --> 00:32:17,187
Because I wanted you
to give me a good evaluation.

661
00:32:19,894 --> 00:32:21,171
I see.

662
00:32:27,889 --> 00:32:30,056
It was nice knowing you,
Miss Susan.

663
00:32:33,955 --> 00:32:37,204
The problem--how to attract
high net worth clients

664
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,823
in a down economy.

665
00:32:38,889 --> 00:32:40,475
The solution? Be creative.

666
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,902
Christie's is hosting
its first ever "sea auction"

667
00:32:42,968 --> 00:32:44,926
on a yacht in St. Barths.

668
00:32:44,993 --> 00:32:48,342
I see a boat
full of millionaires

669
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,268
waiting to be wooed.

670
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:53,442
This is not a bad idea.

671
00:32:53,507 --> 00:32:56,001
Besides, I haven't been
to St. Barths

672
00:32:56,066 --> 00:32:58,364
since you took me there
to celebrate my first promotion.

673
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:00,793
That was a fun weekend.

674
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:02,055
Yeah.

675
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,046
Let's do it.
- Yep.

676
00:33:04,112 --> 00:33:07,850
I gotta take this. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

677
00:33:07,917 --> 00:33:09,275
Okay.

678
00:33:11,462 --> 00:33:16,464
Not to pry, but when you said
Carlos took you to St. Barths...

679
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:20,221
Oh, yeah, we lived together
for a while back in the day.

680
00:33:20,286 --> 00:33:23,118
Oh!
Gaby didn't mention that.

681
00:33:23,184 --> 00:33:25,110
See, that is what I love
about her.

682
00:33:25,175 --> 00:33:27,133
Most women would freak out

683
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:29,660
if their husband hired
an ex-girlfriend

684
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,071
and they were working together
unchaperoned.

685
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:35,100
But she's got the confidence
to just be cool with it.

686
00:33:35,163 --> 00:33:39,485
Yeah. Yeah, that Gaby's
a real class act.

687
00:33:53,229 --> 00:33:55,592
Jessie, I-I am so sorry.

688
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:58,977
Why? You were just
being honest.

689
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:01,532
Still, uh...

690
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:04,027
I never meant
to lead you on.

691
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:07,134
Uh-huh. Well, I was
planning on giving you

692
00:34:07,201 --> 00:34:08,657
a good evaluation anyway,

693
00:34:08,723 --> 00:34:12,379
so... everything's fine.

694
00:34:12,446 --> 00:34:14,697
Look, I need this job.

695
00:34:14,778 --> 00:34:16,737
But even if I didn't,

696
00:34:16,801 --> 00:34:18,727
I would still like you
as a person.

697
00:34:18,792 --> 00:34:21,415
<i>Please,</i> stop.
I don't need your pity.

698
00:34:21,497 --> 00:34:24,392
You know,
I don't get why people say that.

699
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:26,354
I-I love pity.

700
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:29,932
Pity means someone
is trying to understand

701
00:34:29,997 --> 00:34:31,958
what you're going through,

702
00:34:32,025 --> 00:34:35,568
that they sympathize,
and I do.

703
00:34:35,635 --> 00:34:37,965
Susan...

704
00:34:38,032 --> 00:34:41,981
I'm someone who never went out
and looked for love.

705
00:34:42,062 --> 00:34:45,461
Assumed it would find me.
But it didn't.

706
00:34:45,526 --> 00:34:48,098
And now I'm making a fool
of myself...

707
00:34:48,165 --> 00:34:51,870
throwing myself
at straight women,

708
00:34:51,953 --> 00:34:54,348
because I'm so afraid
of being alone.

709
00:34:54,414 --> 00:34:57,374
Now how can you
possibly understand that?

710
00:34:57,457 --> 00:35:00,321
Well, here's how.
Um, I...

711
00:35:00,387 --> 00:35:02,781
I've spent my whole life
putting myself out there,

712
00:35:02,846 --> 00:35:05,713
and, um, I'm still...

713
00:35:05,794 --> 00:35:07,347
today, alone.

714
00:35:07,413 --> 00:35:09,062
Just like you.

715
00:35:11,621 --> 00:35:13,206
It's not the same.

716
00:35:13,288 --> 00:35:15,244
Well, okay, it's not,

717
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:19,387
because I'm alone but I'm not
lonely 'cause I have friends.

718
00:35:19,454 --> 00:35:23,953
Love doesn't happen
for everyone.

719
00:35:24,018 --> 00:35:26,575
You know what?

720
00:35:26,641 --> 00:35:29,780
I don't even know if it's
gonna happen for me anymore.

721
00:35:29,862 --> 00:35:33,196
But my friends are there for me
no matter what,

722
00:35:33,262 --> 00:35:35,495
and that helps.

723
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,986
So at the very least,

724
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:41,063
you know,
let me be there for you...

725
00:35:41,128 --> 00:35:43,053
as a friend.

726
00:35:43,118 --> 00:35:45,983
That'd be nice.

727
00:35:47,977 --> 00:35:49,642
Do your friends hug?

728
00:35:55,617 --> 00:35:57,735
What's that
in the garbage can?

729
00:35:57,802 --> 00:35:59,970
My boots.

730
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:04,291
Hey!

731
00:36:04,357 --> 00:36:06,282
What are you doing here?

732
00:36:06,349 --> 00:36:09,990
I just wanted to see
how your first day went.

733
00:36:10,055 --> 00:36:12,484
Sit. Take a load off.
Spill it.

734
00:36:12,565 --> 00:36:14,522
Oh, that is
so thoughtful of you.

735
00:36:14,588 --> 00:36:17,080
You're such a good friend.
- Oh, well, you know me.

736
00:36:17,145 --> 00:36:18,762
Yeah, I do.

737
00:36:18,845 --> 00:36:21,774
So did you get a good office?
Were the people nice?

738
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,200
Oh, what about Lucy?
Do you like her?

739
00:36:24,268 --> 00:36:27,988
Actually...
I am kinda tired.

740
00:36:28,054 --> 00:36:31,130
I think I'm going
to head inside.

741
00:36:31,194 --> 00:36:32,812
Ooh! What's going on?

742
00:36:32,879 --> 00:36:35,304
I mentioned Lucy,
and you get all weird.

743
00:36:35,371 --> 00:36:37,765
Is something going on
with her... and Carlos?

744
00:36:37,847 --> 00:36:39,755
What? No.

745
00:36:39,837 --> 00:36:41,990
I'm sure
she's just affectionate.

746
00:36:42,053 --> 00:36:45,291
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you
mean by affectionate?

747
00:36:45,373 --> 00:36:46,992
Well, it's probably nothing.

748
00:36:47,055 --> 00:36:49,483
But when Carlos works
on his computer at home,

749
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,976
does he take his shirt off
there, too?

750
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:55,555
That son of a--
I'm gonna kill him!

751
00:36:55,636 --> 00:36:58,470
No, you won't get the chance
'cause I'm gonna kill you first.

752
00:36:58,536 --> 00:37:00,088
Huh?

753
00:37:00,153 --> 00:37:03,051
The houselights are up, Gaby.
You can drop the act.

754
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:06,191
You only helped me get this job
because you needed a spy.

755
00:37:06,271 --> 00:37:08,586
How dare you!

756
00:37:08,669 --> 00:37:10,351
And, yes, I did!

757
00:37:10,416 --> 00:37:11,533
Gaby!

758
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,025
You needed a job.
I did you a favor.

759
00:37:14,092 --> 00:37:16,390
And then I brought you
hot cocoa.

760
00:37:16,455 --> 00:37:18,347
Why don't you ever thank me?
- Because you used me!

761
00:37:18,414 --> 00:37:21,154
At least when I asked you
for a favor, I was up-front.

762
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,200
Oh, <i>were</i> you,

763
00:37:22,265 --> 00:37:24,224
Miss "they offered me
$100,000 a year"?

764
00:37:24,287 --> 00:37:26,180
Oh, you found out
about that?

765
00:37:26,247 --> 00:37:29,190
Honey, I've played poker with
you for the past nine years.

766
00:37:29,257 --> 00:37:31,407
I think I can tell
when you're bluffing.

767
00:37:31,474 --> 00:37:34,014
Okay, it's true.
I used you to get more money,

768
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,866
but you used me first.
- Fine. We're a couple of users.

769
00:37:42,075 --> 00:37:44,582
The big question is,
are we still friends?

770
00:37:48,323 --> 00:37:50,281
Do I still get my salary?

771
00:37:50,347 --> 00:37:52,110
Will you still be my spy?

772
00:38:02,764 --> 00:38:05,839
Dave, I'm curious
about something.

773
00:38:05,904 --> 00:38:07,733
What about?

774
00:38:07,799 --> 00:38:10,257
Well, how do you feel
about kids?

775
00:38:11,749 --> 00:38:13,026
Kids?

776
00:38:13,092 --> 00:38:15,697
Yeah. Haven't you ever
wanted one?

777
00:38:15,764 --> 00:38:20,326
Is this your coy way
of telling me you want a child?

778
00:38:20,392 --> 00:38:22,819
Maybe. I hardly
get to see Travers anymore

779
00:38:22,885 --> 00:38:26,170
Now that he's off
at prep school.

780
00:38:26,236 --> 00:38:28,662
And I always wanted a girl.

781
00:38:28,727 --> 00:38:30,653
Doesn't that sound
like heaven?

782
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:32,643
A beautiful little girl

783
00:38:32,709 --> 00:38:36,966
with blonde curls.

784
00:38:41,516 --> 00:38:46,016
I had this... friend

785
00:38:46,081 --> 00:38:49,932
who had a little girl.

786
00:38:49,998 --> 00:38:53,734
From the moment she was born,

787
00:38:53,818 --> 00:38:55,969
she was his whole life.

788
00:38:58,804 --> 00:39:02,041
Unfortunately,
she was in an accident..

789
00:39:02,123 --> 00:39:03,594
and died.

790
00:39:05,893 --> 00:39:08,322
He told me
that when that happened,

791
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:10,314
a part of him died, too.

792
00:39:10,379 --> 00:39:12,821
He spent
the rest of his life

793
00:39:12,887 --> 00:39:15,105
in a kind of... daze,

794
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:16,596
always...

795
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:20,918
wondering exactly how old
she would've been,

796
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:22,974
what she would've looked like.

797
00:39:27,669 --> 00:39:29,725
No.

798
00:39:29,807 --> 00:39:33,238
I don't think
I'd want a child.

799
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,294
It's just not worth it.

800
00:39:41,917 --> 00:39:43,503
You okay, babe?

801
00:39:43,569 --> 00:39:44,863
Yeah.

802
00:39:44,927 --> 00:39:46,512
I...

803
00:39:46,578 --> 00:39:49,216
I'm just sad
for your friend.

804
00:39:51,402 --> 00:39:53,199
Yeah.

805
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:55,903
I had hoped that
this compulsion to steal

806
00:39:55,968 --> 00:39:57,926
was something
we could solve privately,

807
00:39:57,993 --> 00:40:00,177
but Orson seems unable--

808
00:40:00,258 --> 00:40:03,122
or unwilling--

809
00:40:03,188 --> 00:40:05,113
to control himself.

810
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:09,000
Is that true, Orson? Are you
unable to control yourself?

811
00:40:09,065 --> 00:40:12,333
You'll see when he leaves,
and your lamp is missing.

812
00:40:12,399 --> 00:40:15,654
So... how do you want
to proceed?

813
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,053
Would you like to begin
with some couples counseling?

814
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,788
This isn't <i>my</i> problem,
Dr. Bernstein.

815
00:40:21,854 --> 00:40:25,058
<i>He's</i> the sick one.

816
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,503
Fix <i>him.</i>

817
00:40:33,509 --> 00:40:36,777
You know why she's so angry?

818
00:40:38,576 --> 00:40:44,110
Because this is something
she can't control,

819
00:40:44,176 --> 00:40:45,988
and I love it.

820
00:40:49,746 --> 00:40:52,205
Now there's no phone
in the cabin,

821
00:40:52,238 --> 00:40:55,589
but if it's an emergency,
you can reach me on my cell.

822
00:40:55,654 --> 00:40:57,742
You just be careful
out there.

823
00:40:59,946 --> 00:41:02,747
I don't know what I'd do
without you.

824
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,976
Bye.

825
00:41:12,865 --> 00:41:15,502
Here's the article
that lady was looking for.

826
00:41:15,567 --> 00:41:17,492
You want me to fax it?

827
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:20,598
Ah, take your time.
She's a pain in the ass.

828
00:41:20,665 --> 00:41:22,654
She's pretty hot, though.

829
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:24,612
How does that help me?

830
00:41:24,677 --> 00:41:27,217
She can wait until tomorrow.
- All right.

831
00:41:33,046 --> 00:41:36,397
<i>You can find them</i>
<i>almost anywhere--</i>

832
00:41:36,463 --> 00:41:39,408
<i>friendly people</i>
<i>with hidden agendas--</i>

833
00:41:39,474 --> 00:41:42,306
<i>The woman</i>
<i>who uses her neighbor</i>

834
00:41:42,371 --> 00:41:44,574
<i>to get herself a job...</i>

835
00:41:46,858 --> 00:41:49,303
<i>The wife</i>
<i>who uses her influence</i>

836
00:41:49,369 --> 00:41:52,444
<i>to hire a friendly spy...</i>

837
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:57,156
<i>The husband</i>
<i>who uses his charm</i>

838
00:41:57,238 --> 00:42:00,505
<i>to steal from his friends...</i>

839
00:42:00,572 --> 00:42:05,297
<i>and you can be sure</i>
<i>the friendliest people of all</i>

840
00:42:05,363 --> 00:42:10,590
<i>have agendas that won't ever</i>
<i>be discovered...</i>

841
00:42:10,673 --> 00:42:12,144
<i>Not until...</i>

842
00:42:12,226 --> 00:42:14,249
<i>it's too late.</i>
