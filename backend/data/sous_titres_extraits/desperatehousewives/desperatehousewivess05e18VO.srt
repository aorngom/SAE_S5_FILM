1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,834
<i>Previously on...</i>

2
00:00:01,902 --> 00:00:04,237
<i>A thief was confronted.</i>
Well, maybe you'll feel

3
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:06,839
comfortable talking to a professional.
- A psychiatrist?

4
00:00:06,907 --> 00:00:10,576
Someone light me a cigar.
<i>- Carlos hired a old girlfriend...</i>

5
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:13,980
<i>and Gaby hired a spy.</i>
- I talked to Carlos. You're in!

6
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:14,007
<i>Edie dug deeper into Dave's past.</i>

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,217
Killed three years ago--
car crash.

8
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:20,786
That was his wife.
Give me that one.

9
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,722
Their daughter died
in the same crash.

10
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:25,958
<i>And Dave's master plan...</i>
- You really think I make

11
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,870
<i>that</i> much of a
difference in Mike's life?

12
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:28,661
If he ever lost you,

13
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:30,529
it would destroy him.

14
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:33,466
<i>entered its final phase.</i>

15
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:39,472
Uh, hi. Is this
the ranger station?

16
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,475
Well, I didn't know whether
to call you or fish and game,

17
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,444
but, uh, I think I saw some guys
up at Emerson Woods

18
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,413
hunting illegally,
and I got worried

19
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:50,416
because I know people like
to go camping up there,

20
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:53,286
and I-I sure wouldn't
want anyone to get hurt.

21
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:56,022
Oh. No, no need to thank me.

22
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:59,292
I'just doing my part
as a concerned citizen.

23
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,360
Bye now.

24
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,097
<i> Dave Williams</i>

25
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:08,834
<i>had been planning the murder for years.</i>

26
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:13,539
<i>And like all the best plans,</i>
<i>it was a simple one.</i>

27
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,942
<i>First, he would guide</i>

28
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,177
<i>Mike Delfino</i>
<i>and Katherine Mayfair</i>

29
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,713
<i>to a remote cabin.</i>

30
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:24,350
<i>The next morning,</i>
<i>he'd pretend to be asleep</i>

31
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:29,322
<i>as the two lovers</i>
<i>left to go hiking.</i>

32
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:32,491
<i>Dave would then grab the gun</i>
<i>he'd carefully hidden...</i>

33
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:37,730
<i>and start to follow his quarry.</i>

34
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:40,800
<i>He'd wait until the two</i>
<i>had paused for a moment</i>

35
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,735
<i>to catch their breaths.</i>

36
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:44,837
<i>And then</i>
<i>he'd pull the trigger...</i>

37
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:52,845
<i>breaking the heart of the man</i>
<i>who had killed his wife.</i>

38
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,081
<i>When the rangers arrived,</i>

39
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:59,552
<i>they would mention the reports</i>
<i>of illegal hunters in the area.</i>

40
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,555
<i>And Dave would drive Mike</i>
<i>back home,</i>

41
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:06,559
<i>all the while</i>
<i>enjoying his pain.</i>

42
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,128
<i>Yes,</i>

43
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:11,263
<i>Dave Williams had come up</i>

44
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,567
<i>with a very simple plan.</i>

45
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,469
Ugh!

46
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:20,539
<i>But as he was about</i>
<i>to discover...</i>

47
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,042
Have you faxed this clipping
to Edie Williams yet?

48
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,011
Um, doing it right now.

49
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:27,246
<i>there is nothing simple...</i>

50
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,716
<i>about murder.</i>

51
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:50,403
<i>Life is full</i>
<i>of nasty shocks...</i>

52
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,841
<i>unpleasant surprises</i>
<i>that jolt our systems...</i>

53
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,979
<i>and cause our hearts</i>
<i>to skip a beat.</i>

54
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:05,184
<i>And these shocks</i>
<i>always occur...</i>

55
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:06,685
Susan?
- Hey, Karl.

56
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,088
<i>when we least expect them.</i>

57
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:10,222
Karl.

58
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,224
What are you doing here?

59
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,060
Well, I just enrolled Evan.

60
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,394
Wow.

61
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:16,929
And I was worried

62
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:19,398
that we'd be out
of each other's lives forever.

63
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,300
Mm, lucky, lucky.

64
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,804
What are you doing here?
- I am an art teacher.

65
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,306
Really? Do <i>they</i> know that?

66
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:31,410
And now I'm ignoring you
and moving on to Evan.

67
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:33,446
Hello, Evan.

68
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,081
Evan, this is Susan.

69
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,083
She's your sister Julie's
mother.

70
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,186
We used to be married.
She was a lot younger then.

71
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:43,689
Evan, why don't you
head into the classroom?

72
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:46,192
I need to talk
to your daddy,

73
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,628
and I may need to use some
grown-up words.

74
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,730
Okay, Susie Q.,
what's wrong?

75
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:55,301
Get it off that chest
you wouldn't let me enhance.

76
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,969
Listen, it's bad enough

77
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,872
that I've got one ex-husband
running around the halls.

78
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,875
I don't need the faculty
and the parents

79
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:04,844
knowing that I have two.

80
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,313
So not a word about
us having been married.

81
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,082
No more wisecracks.
No Susie Q's.

82
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,919
I am Miss Susan,
art teacher.

83
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,521
Yes, Miss Susan.

84
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:20,259
Can I bang your erasers
after class?

85
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,761
Karl, I'm serious.
Don't mess with me.

86
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,432
I have a yardstick,
and I'm not afraid to use it.

87
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:31,370
We're gonna be
making a presentation

88
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,006
for the Morrison contract
sooner than we planned.

89
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:36,842
There are a lot of firms
gunning for this,

90
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,978
and--damn it, Lynette!
Don't--don't touch my figurines.

91
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,580
These are worth more
than the house you live in.

92
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,416
Big deal.
- So is this coffee mug.

93
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,286
All right, we should
break for lunch.

94
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:49,655
No. Until this deal closes,
we work through lunch.

95
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:53,192
But as a consolation,
we'll also be working nights.

96
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,661
Nights? You really think
that's necessary?

97
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:59,431
This is a $10 million deal,
Carlos. How bad do you want it?

98
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:02,401
You heard the woman.
We're working nights.

99
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:06,238
Um, I have
a tiny scheduling conflict.

100
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,874
I coach my daughter's basketball
team on Friday nights.

101
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:11,844
So if I could--
- Friday nights are now work nights.

102
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:13,779
If we're successful,

103
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:16,782
those of you on commission
stand to do very well.

104
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,785
And those of you who aren't?
Well, you get to keep your jobs,

105
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:23,656
which, in this economy,
is a bonus all by itself.

106
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,160
All right, let's run down
to the deli, grab a sandwich

107
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:30,129
and meet back here in five.

108
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:32,198
You.

109
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,399
No touching.

110
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:37,002
And, yes, I'll know.

111
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,407
Isn't she fun?

112
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,344
Hey, Carlos.

113
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:48,013
Did I ever tell you

114
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,349
that Tom and I seriously
considered you and Gaby

115
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:53,219
for Penny's godparents?
- You're not getting Friday nights off.

116
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:56,355
Look, I'm not happy
about the schedule either.

117
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:59,358
I'm missing my kids, too.
- Then do something about it.

118
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:01,335
You're the President.
Put the brakes on Lucy.

119
00:06:01,336 --> 00:06:02,995
Lynette, I hired
her to crack the whip,

120
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:05,965
and that's what she's doing.
It's good for the company.

121
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,967
But she makes people crazy.

122
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,421
Can't you talk to her, get
her to dial it down a bit?

123
00:06:10,422 --> 00:06:11,437
I will think about it.

124
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,539
But don't be asking me
for favors like this.

125
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:16,008
When we're at the office,
I'm not your neighbor,

126
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:17,576
I'm not your friend.

127
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:20,446
I'm your boss. Got it?

128
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,014
Oh, by the way,

129
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:25,017
you and Tom are coming over
for cocktails on Saturday.

130
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:29,455
Oh, yeah. I plan to get drunk
and bitch about my boss.

131
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:34,727
I'm sorry,
but this is unacceptable.

132
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,630
Do you at least
know <i>why</i> he steals?

133
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,131
If there were

134
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,133
some sordid childhood trauma
we could blame it on,

135
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:43,473
it would really help me
out with the neighbors.

136
00:06:43,474 --> 00:06:44,136
Oh, he knows.

137
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:47,573
Dr. Bernstein uncovered that
my very first session.

138
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,842
Really? And--and yet
he keeps charging me.

139
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,511
So, doctor,
what's this "revelation"

140
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,114
that you've been keeping from me
for $200 an hour?

141
00:06:57,384 --> 00:07:01,253
I steal to hurt you.

142
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:04,556
Why would you want
to hurt me?

143
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,026
Each day for the past year,

144
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,828
you have, inch by inch,

145
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,031
slice by slice,

146
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,200
brought me closer
to being a eunuch.

147
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,872
Would you excuse us
for moment?

148
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,541
This just became
a private conversation.

149
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,843
If I stay,
I might be able to help.

150
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,345
You wanna help?

151
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:29,348
Why don't you go down
to the pharmacy in the lobby

152
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,883
and buy some aspirin?

153
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,584
I'm gonna need it.

154
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:44,196
I don't deserve this.

155
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:46,298
I have been nothing
but supportive of you

156
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:48,267
since you got out of jail.

157
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:50,869
I even gave you a job.

158
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:53,405
I wanted to be
your partner.

159
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,374
You made me an employee.

160
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:59,244
So you decided to punish me
by resorting to petty theft?

161
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,314
For God sakes, Orson,
I'm your wife.

162
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:05,050
Perhaps, but I'm not
your husband.

163
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:09,088
We may share a bed, but you save
your passion for your company.

164
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,423
That's not true!
- Isn't it?

165
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:15,094
Every day for the past year,
I have been in the background,

166
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,595
an afterthought,

167
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:20,065
While you spend day and night
nurturing your business.

168
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:23,001
All the while thinking
I had your support.

169
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,536
I tried.

170
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:28,974
I thought I wouldn't mind
being Mr. Bree Van de Kamp.

171
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,410
But it's killing me.

172
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:35,647
Every day, I get smaller
and smaller.

173
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:39,418
And if something
doesn't change,

174
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:43,922
Orson Hodge is just gonna
disappear altogether.

175
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:49,661
Girls are out
like a light. Thanks for dinner.

176
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:52,631
Carlos, do you have to back to work?
- Gaby, I got a meeting.

177
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,967
But can't Lucy cover it?

178
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:57,136
You know those two extras
zeroes at the end of my paycheck

179
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,438
you like so much? They're there
because I'm President.

180
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:01,740
Hours are part of the gig.

181
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:04,276
Hey. How about a quickie?

182
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:06,645
Babe, I don't have time.

183
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:10,549
Right, that's why I didn't
suggest a longie. Oh, come on.

184
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:12,551
I'll have your eyes
rolling back in your head

185
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:13,613
in three minutes flat.

186
00:09:13,614 --> 00:09:16,188
You wanna do it there in
front of the kids' sippy cups?

187
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,293
All gone.

188
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:24,563
Now let's do this.
It'll be like old times.

189
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,832
We never did it
on the table.

190
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,768
Yeah, we did, years ago.
Don't you remember?

191
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,339
I don't think that was me.

192
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,108
Oh. Right.

193
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,577
Well, we'll create
new table memories.

194
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:41,547
If you're trying to turn me on,
you just failed miserably.

195
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,216
Carlos, do you
realize since Bradley died

196
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,185
and you took over,
we haven't had sex once?

197
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,520
I miss you. I wanna
spend time with you.

198
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,490
Now move the creamed corn and do me!
- Okay, how about tomorrow night?

199
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:53,492
Yeah,
I've heard that before,

200
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,961
and then tomorrow comes,
and you're too tired.

201
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,430
Okay, then, this weekend.
I'll be all yours.

202
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:01,467
And we can defile any piece
of furniture you want.

203
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:08,807
Hey, Karen, you don't have
any fax paper, do you?

204
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,542
Fax paper!

205
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,712
Turn down the Dean Martin!

206
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,681
Don't worry about it.

207
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,984
I'll go to the store tomorrow.
Do you need anything?

208
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:22,254
Eggs... Milk...

209
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,722
Lightbulbs...

210
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,724
Okay, let's make this easier.

211
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,693
Is there anything
you <i>don't</i> need?

212
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,361
I'll tell you what.

213
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:32,097
I'll call you from the store
in the morning, okay?

214
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:44,401
What a lovely rainbow, June.

215
00:10:44,469 --> 00:10:47,204
Here's a gold star for you.

216
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,906
Oh, Drew, wow!

217
00:10:49,974 --> 00:10:52,943
You know,
elephants don't have wings,

218
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:56,713
but I like the way
you're thinking.

219
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,416
Hey, Evan,
what did you draw?

220
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,752
Oh.

221
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,856
Um...
That's a lot of red.

222
00:11:05,923 --> 00:11:07,924
It's blood.

223
00:11:07,992 --> 00:11:10,760
Okay.

224
00:11:10,828 --> 00:11:12,662
So...

225
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:16,099
That man must be a doctor

226
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:19,369
making the bloody man
all better?

227
00:11:19,437 --> 00:11:22,739
No, he's stabbing him
in the guts with a sword.

228
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,742
Evan, that's...

229
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,711
kind of a scary picture.

230
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:29,379
Nuh-unh, it's funny.

231
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:31,982
No, Honey,
it's inappropriate,

232
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:33,984
especially when
the assignment was

233
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:36,253
to make a picture
that makes you happy.

234
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,722
This does make me happy.

235
00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:40,590
Where's my gold star?

236
00:11:44,295 --> 00:11:46,429
I just can't get used
to everyone working--

237
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,232
First Bree, then Susan,
now Lynette.

238
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,067
Thank God for you.

239
00:11:51,135 --> 00:11:53,837
I just had to
get out of that boring house.

240
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:56,093
So what do you gals do
when you get together?

241
00:11:56,094 --> 00:11:56,806
Mostly gossip.

242
00:11:56,874 --> 00:11:59,676
Mm.
- You got any good gossip?

243
00:11:59,744 --> 00:12:03,313
Ooh. I heard Ed Simmons
got a Harley.

244
00:12:05,216 --> 00:12:07,117
You know, I should get back.

245
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,991
Come on. Give me a break.
I'm still new at this.

246
00:12:09,992 --> 00:12:10,620
Okay.

247
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,523
We'll start with something
a little easier--bitching.

248
00:12:13,591 --> 00:12:16,059
I can handle that.
Bitch away.

249
00:12:16,127 --> 00:12:19,863
Well, I am so pissed at Carlos.
He is never home.

250
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:22,832
And when he is, he's too tired
to do anything.

251
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,535
And by "anything,"
I mean sex.

252
00:12:27,104 --> 00:12:28,572
Are you uncomfortable?

253
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,740
A little. Go on.

254
00:12:30,808 --> 00:12:33,410
Well, we've never had
a drought like this.

255
00:12:33,477 --> 00:12:35,378
It's been almost two weeks.

256
00:12:35,446 --> 00:12:38,248
Two weeks? And that's
a drought for you?

257
00:12:38,316 --> 00:12:40,984
Yeah. Lately, Carlos just
doesn't want to do it.

258
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,320
Wrong.
Guys <i>always</i> wanna do it.

259
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,955
Really?
- Yeah.

260
00:12:45,022 --> 00:12:48,091
Even if you're tired
and get home late?

261
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:50,093
Even if we're exhausted
and late

262
00:12:50,161 --> 00:12:52,295
and been shot in the leg...
twice.

263
00:12:52,363 --> 00:12:53,964
We still want to.

264
00:12:54,031 --> 00:12:57,167
So you just gotta get past
the tired adult to find

265
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,135
the horny teenage boy inside.

266
00:12:59,203 --> 00:13:01,871
Huh. That's good to know.

267
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:04,374
You're good
at this girl talk thing.

268
00:13:04,442 --> 00:13:06,042
Well, thanks.

269
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,646
So, um, does Lynette ever
talk about me and sex?

270
00:13:11,482 --> 00:13:13,450
Yeah, I should get back.

271
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,888
You called me
down here for this?

272
00:13:18,956 --> 00:13:21,157
It's a kid playing
with a soccer ball.

273
00:13:21,225 --> 00:13:24,628
It's a head, and he's stabbing
someone with a sword.

274
00:13:24,695 --> 00:13:27,063
Well, maybe it was
in self-defense.

275
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:31,134
Mr. Mayer, generally, when kids
exhibit this type of behavior,

276
00:13:31,202 --> 00:13:32,769
there's a problem.

277
00:13:32,837 --> 00:13:35,538
Excuse me.

278
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,540
I have to take this. Sorry.

279
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,143
Hello?

280
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:43,913
Thanks for ratting out my kid
on his first day.

281
00:13:43,981 --> 00:13:46,883
It's not my fault. I showed this
to the school psychologist.

282
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,000
She gave it to the principal.
My hands were tied.

283
00:13:49,001 --> 00:13:50,353
So right away it's Evan's fault?

284
00:13:50,421 --> 00:13:51,855
Did you ever consider

285
00:13:51,922 --> 00:13:53,990
that he didn't understand
the assignment?

286
00:13:54,058 --> 00:13:56,493
I told the class to draw
something that made them happy.

287
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,461
All the other kids
drew kittens and rainbows.

288
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:01,898
Your son drew small intestines
on the end of a stick.

289
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,234
Let's cut to what
this is really about.

290
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:07,570
You hate <i>me,</i> and you don't
want my son in your class.

291
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:10,206
That is not true!
- It is, too!

292
00:14:10,274 --> 00:14:12,175
You're still punishing me
for what happened between us.

293
00:14:12,243 --> 00:14:14,177
You're stuck in the past

294
00:14:14,245 --> 00:14:17,147
and blaming me for your screwed-up life!
- Okay, will someone call Guinness?

295
00:14:17,214 --> 00:14:19,816
Because you just set
the world record

296
00:14:19,884 --> 00:14:22,901
for the biggest load
of crap in one sentence.

297
00:14:22,902 --> 00:14:23,753
Oh, bite me!

298
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,822
How long was I gone?

299
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,791
Uh...

300
00:14:27,858 --> 00:14:29,793
This is nothing, Mr. Hobson.

301
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,096
We were just having
a difference of opinion.

302
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:35,465
Yeah, and my opinion is

303
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:37,901
your <i>teacher</i> doesn't understand
the difference

304
00:14:37,968 --> 00:14:39,616
between emotional
problems and creativity.

305
00:14:39,617 --> 00:14:40,804
Shut up, Karl.

306
00:14:40,871 --> 00:14:43,039
Excuse me. Did you just
tell him to shut up?

307
00:14:43,107 --> 00:14:46,576
You know, this is
typical "Susan" behavior.

308
00:14:46,644 --> 00:14:49,546
And you wonder why
no man can stay with you.

309
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,254
Would this seem
any less shocking

310
00:14:58,322 --> 00:15:01,391
if I told you we were
once married for 12 years?

311
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:09,065
Yes,
am I speaking to Mr. Dinsmore?

312
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:12,068
Ah, this is Bree Van de Kamp.

313
00:15:12,136 --> 00:15:15,171
Yes,
it's nice to talk to you, too.

314
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:17,207
Well, as I'm sure you're aware,

315
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:21,411
your company has made
several offers to purchase mine.

316
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:23,913
Yes, I know I said
I wasn't interested,

317
00:15:23,981 --> 00:15:26,383
but some things have happened
in my personal life

318
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:29,319
and I think I'm ready to...

319
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:32,689
finally make a deal.

320
00:15:32,757 --> 00:15:34,457
Really?

321
00:15:34,525 --> 00:15:36,393
Well, that's wonderful.

322
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,861
Why don't you, uh,

323
00:15:37,928 --> 00:15:41,831
come to my office tomorrow
and we'll talk?

324
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,400
Goodye, Mr. Dinsmore.

325
00:15:50,466 --> 00:15:52,433
Ok, there you go.
The rest is yours.

326
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:54,402
Thanks.
I don't know what it is.

327
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,539
Every time I go to the market,
there's stuff I forget.

328
00:15:57,606 --> 00:16:00,208
I know what it is.
You're old.

329
00:16:02,344 --> 00:16:04,979
So where's Dave?
- Camping.

330
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,981
Ooh, camping. How fun.

331
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,616
Enjoying the great outdoors,

332
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:11,119
getting a bunch of teenage kids
on prom weekend.

333
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:13,154
Good for him.

334
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,423
Look, I know that you think
he's some creepy psycho.

335
00:16:15,491 --> 00:16:19,827
But you should know that
he has had a very hard life,

336
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,964
and there are things about him
that you don't understand.

337
00:16:23,032 --> 00:16:23,998
Like what?

338
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,000
Like he was married before,

339
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,002
and his wife died
in an accident

340
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,205
along with
their 3-year-old daughter.

341
00:16:30,272 --> 00:16:32,874
Oh, Edie. Are you sure?

342
00:16:32,942 --> 00:16:35,510
Yes.

343
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,645
So if at times

344
00:16:37,713 --> 00:16:41,649
his behavior seems
a little strange,

345
00:16:41,717 --> 00:16:44,619
try to remember the grief
he's carrying.

346
00:16:46,655 --> 00:16:49,357
You know, I lost a kid.

347
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,126
It does things to you.

348
00:16:52,194 --> 00:16:54,362
No wonder he...

349
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,364
Oh, God, I wish I'd known.

350
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,333
Well, you do now.

351
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,302
So next time, try to be
a little more understanding.

352
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,271
Of course.

353
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:06,274
You know,
I could use a drink.

354
00:17:06,342 --> 00:17:09,544
Come to my house and we'll
crank up Dean Martin and...

355
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,179
toss a few back.

356
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:12,747
Come on.

357
00:17:48,884 --> 00:17:51,352
Mom?

358
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:56,024
Oh, Andrew.
I didn't hear you come in.

359
00:17:56,091 --> 00:17:58,893
That Dinsmore guy
is waiting for you downstairs.

360
00:17:58,961 --> 00:18:01,362
Thank you, dear.

361
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,335
I must say, Bree. I was
surprised to get your call.

362
00:18:07,403 --> 00:18:09,671
You've always said
you'd never sell your company.

363
00:18:09,738 --> 00:18:12,940
Bree has decided
she wants more family time.

364
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,176
She's a very traditional woman,
you know.

365
00:18:15,244 --> 00:18:18,146
It's one of the reasons
I fell in love with her.

366
00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:20,782
Does that mean you're going
to stop working altogether?

367
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:23,751
I know your fans have been
hoping for a second book,

368
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:25,853
uh, my wife included.

369
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:27,855
That's sweet,
but I've decided to focus

370
00:18:27,923 --> 00:18:29,824
on other pursuits
at the moment.

371
00:18:29,892 --> 00:18:32,827
Mm, yes, her sole ambition now
is to be Mrs. Orson Hodge.

372
00:18:32,895 --> 00:18:34,796
And at the risk
of sounding selfish,

373
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:38,166
I'm glad I'll be the only one
she's cooking for.

374
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:40,755
Were you able to look over
the contracts I sent over?

375
00:18:40,756 --> 00:18:41,269
Oh, shoot.

376
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:44,605
I left them upstairs.
Oh. Well, I'll get them.

377
00:18:44,673 --> 00:18:47,342
I'll show you the offices
before we start the demolition.

378
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:49,544
You're getting rid
of your office?

379
00:18:49,611 --> 00:18:51,512
No, we don't need it anymore,

380
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,817
and Bree knows I've always
wanted a game room.

381
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:59,187
So it's your "sole ambition"
to be Mrs. Orson Hodge?

382
00:18:59,254 --> 00:19:00,521
Andrew.

383
00:19:00,589 --> 00:19:02,657
No, I-I have to ask.

384
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:05,126
Why are you letting Orson
sell your company?

385
00:19:05,194 --> 00:19:06,794
It was my idea.

386
00:19:06,862 --> 00:19:09,864
My work has been
compromising my marriage.

387
00:19:09,932 --> 00:19:12,867
I didn't realize the toll
it's been taking on Orson.

388
00:19:12,935 --> 00:19:16,804
Okay, so he's unhappy.

389
00:19:16,872 --> 00:19:18,806
Buy him some golf clubs,
put him on lithium,

390
00:19:18,874 --> 00:19:21,342
but don't give up everything
you've worked so hard for.

391
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,345
Andrew, do you know why
my book sold so well?

392
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,980
Because it was authentic.

393
00:19:26,048 --> 00:19:27,648
I actually believe in

394
00:19:27,716 --> 00:19:29,617
the old-fashioned values
I wrote about.

395
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:31,953
I believe in men
opening doors for ladies

396
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,955
and children
respecting their elders.

397
00:19:34,022 --> 00:19:36,958
I also believe that sometimes

398
00:19:37,025 --> 00:19:39,093
women need to make sacrifices
for their husbands.

399
00:19:39,161 --> 00:19:41,062
I would be
the worst kind of hypoite

400
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,064
if I preached these values

401
00:19:43,132 --> 00:19:46,000
and then didn't
follow them myself.

402
00:19:46,068 --> 00:19:48,002
Okay, I get it.
You love Orson,

403
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,238
and you're willing to
sell your company to prove it.

404
00:19:50,305 --> 00:19:53,074
What I'm wondering is,
is if he loves you,

405
00:19:53,142 --> 00:19:56,844
why would he want you to stop
doing what makes you happy?

406
00:20:07,055 --> 00:20:09,424
Hey. You busy?

407
00:20:09,491 --> 00:20:11,325
What is it?

408
00:20:11,393 --> 00:20:14,395
I brought you
a little gift.

409
00:20:15,898 --> 00:20:17,632
Oh. Cute.

410
00:20:17,699 --> 00:20:22,403
I thought it would be a nice
addition to your collection.

411
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,805
Uh-huh.

412
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,014
I knew it was you.

413
00:20:33,081 --> 00:20:34,282
Pardon?

414
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:37,185
You're the one who complained
about me to Carlos.

415
00:20:37,252 --> 00:20:39,454
I'm... not sure
what you're talking about.

416
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:42,156
Oh, jeez. What,
you knife me in the back,

417
00:20:42,224 --> 00:20:44,125
and now you're gonna
play stupid?

418
00:20:44,193 --> 00:20:46,894
Carlos said some people
are having problems with me

419
00:20:46,962 --> 00:20:49,363
and that I should
watch my demeanor.

420
00:20:49,431 --> 00:20:52,834
And I thought to myself,
who are "some people"?

421
00:20:52,901 --> 00:20:56,070
And then it hit me--
it's the chummy neighbor.

422
00:20:56,138 --> 00:20:58,039
Okay, yes, Carlos and I
spoke briefly,

423
00:20:58,106 --> 00:21:00,908
but I thought he blew me off.
- So that's your defense?

424
00:21:00,976 --> 00:21:03,678
You thought your backstabbing
was unsuccessful?

425
00:21:03,745 --> 00:21:06,180
Well, I'll admit
it's kind of flimsy,

426
00:21:06,248 --> 00:21:09,584
but until I got
something better...

427
00:21:09,651 --> 00:21:12,353
Okay, next time you have
an issue with me,

428
00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:14,322
you know where my office is.

429
00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:18,493
Oh, and, uh, as far as
Friday nights are concerned...

430
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,196
consider that
a permanent work night.

431
00:21:22,264 --> 00:21:23,698
Don't worry.

432
00:21:23,765 --> 00:21:26,667
If you're as bad at coaching
as you are at office politics,

433
00:21:26,735 --> 00:21:28,936
your daughter
won't be missing much.

434
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:39,213
Found the contract.

435
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:40,882
Everything is in order.

436
00:21:40,949 --> 00:21:44,218
All we need now is your signature.
- Mr. Dimore, would you mind

437
00:21:44,286 --> 00:21:46,787
if I speak to my husband
for a moment?

438
00:21:46,855 --> 00:21:51,058
Oh, yeah, please, go ahead.
I'll--I'll be right outside.

439
00:21:51,126 --> 00:21:52,393
What's wrong?

440
00:21:52,461 --> 00:21:55,897
This is happening
so fast.

441
00:21:55,964 --> 00:21:59,300
Yes, a bit.
But it was your idea.

442
00:21:59,368 --> 00:22:01,836
Well, I have a new idea.

443
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,538
I'd like to wait.

444
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:07,742
Wait? But I-I need this
for my recovery.

445
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:11,479
Just give me one year. That's
not asking too much, is it?

446
00:22:11,547 --> 00:22:15,316
You made me a promise.
You need to stick to it.

447
00:22:15,384 --> 00:22:19,353
Orson, think about how I built
this company from nothing,

448
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:23,891
how it brings me joy and pride
and a sense of accomplishment.

449
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:27,528
Is that <i>really</i> something
you want me to give up?

450
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,731
Yes.

451
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:39,574
Mr. Dinsmore, would you
come back in, please?

452
00:22:42,511 --> 00:22:44,478
So are we ready?

453
00:22:47,482 --> 00:22:49,750
Actually, no.

454
00:22:49,818 --> 00:22:51,552
I'm not selling.

455
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,020
Excuse me?

456
00:22:53,088 --> 00:22:54,622
Tell your wife

457
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:57,191
I will be doing
that second book after all.

458
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,828
Well, I'm--I'm sorry
to hear that.

459
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,932
Bree...

460
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,801
What about my problem?

461
00:23:06,868 --> 00:23:08,769
I might start stealing
again.

462
00:23:08,837 --> 00:23:12,239
Steal what you must,
my love.

463
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,875
But it won't be my company.

464
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,959
Look at him.

465
00:23:32,027 --> 00:23:33,794
He's out like a light
already.

466
00:23:33,862 --> 00:23:36,897
That's what a long day
of fishing does to you.

467
00:23:36,965 --> 00:23:39,133
Yeah, well, he's gonna need
all of his energy

468
00:23:39,201 --> 00:23:41,135
for our big hike tomorrow,
right?

469
00:23:41,203 --> 00:23:43,671
Actually, I don't think
I'm gonna go with you guys.

470
00:23:43,739 --> 00:23:45,706
My knee's been
kind of bothering me.

471
00:23:45,774 --> 00:23:48,109
Okay, well, then why don't we
wait till the next day

472
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,111
and see how you feel?

473
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:53,080
No, no, it's fine.
I'm just gonna hang out here.

474
00:23:53,148 --> 00:23:55,082
Besides,
it's such a romantic hike.

475
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,785
You guys should do it alone.

476
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,855
You always have
such a good attitude.

477
00:24:00,922 --> 00:24:02,857
Do I?
- Uh-huh.

478
00:24:02,924 --> 00:24:06,894
It seems like you take
everything in stride, you know?

479
00:24:06,962 --> 00:24:10,264
Like you just naturally find
the silver lining.

480
00:24:10,332 --> 00:24:13,200
Yeah, I wish
it were natural.

481
00:24:13,268 --> 00:24:15,670
I had to teach myself
to be this way.

482
00:24:15,737 --> 00:24:18,172
With some of the stuff
that's happened to me,

483
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,708
I never would've survived
if I hadn't.

484
00:24:23,178 --> 00:24:24,879
So what's your secret?

485
00:24:24,946 --> 00:24:28,315
Oh, I realized that...

486
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:33,154
I was waiting for somebody
to fix things.

487
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:36,657
But no one was going to.

488
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,726
It was all up to me.

489
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:44,398
I had to decide
what was important

490
00:24:44,466 --> 00:24:47,268
And go after it.

491
00:24:47,335 --> 00:24:50,004
I had to make myself happy.

492
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:53,207
Are you?

493
00:24:53,275 --> 00:24:55,676
Happy.

494
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,778
I'm gettin' there.

495
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,583
Why don't you get some sleep?

496
00:25:02,651 --> 00:25:04,418
You got a big day tomorrow.

497
00:25:17,797 --> 00:25:20,632
Come on, Lucy. Why would you
agree to this meeting?

498
00:25:20,699 --> 00:25:22,867
Well, we're overextended
as it is.

499
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,637
Fine.

500
00:25:25,704 --> 00:25:28,606
Yeah, I'll see you at
the conference room at 7:00 A.M.

501
00:25:28,674 --> 00:25:30,608
Hi there.

502
00:25:30,676 --> 00:25:32,343
Hey, babe.

503
00:25:32,411 --> 00:25:35,180
What are you doing up?

504
00:25:35,247 --> 00:25:38,850
I couldn't sleep.
I was a little hot.

505
00:25:42,054 --> 00:25:44,155
That's better.

506
00:25:44,223 --> 00:25:46,291
You look
a little warm yourself.

507
00:25:46,358 --> 00:25:48,814
Okay, I know where
you're going with this.

508
00:25:48,815 --> 00:25:50,128
Oh, if that were true,

509
00:25:50,196 --> 00:25:52,989
your pants would be around
your ankles right now.

510
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,833
Gaby what are you doing?

511
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,869
I'm releasing the horny
teen inside of you.

512
00:25:57,937 --> 00:26:00,405
Now come on. Two boobs, no waiting.
- Damn it, Gaby,

513
00:26:00,473 --> 00:26:03,448
I thought we were gonna wait
till the weekend. I'm tired.

514
00:26:03,449 --> 00:26:04,576
Not my problem.

515
00:26:06,145 --> 00:26:09,047
Actually, it is! You know,
if big Carlos is tired,

516
00:26:09,115 --> 00:26:11,783
that pretty much rules out
little Carlos, too.

517
00:26:11,851 --> 00:26:13,751
Now listen up,
the pair of you.

518
00:26:13,819 --> 00:26:16,721
I haven't been sitting around
in butt floss all night

519
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:19,324
for my health.
You're putting out.

520
00:26:23,662 --> 00:26:24,929
Oh! Ahh!

521
00:26:24,997 --> 00:26:26,764
That's more like it!

522
00:26:26,832 --> 00:26:28,900
Well, I'm awake now.

523
00:26:28,968 --> 00:26:31,002
In fact...

524
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:34,272
mind if we spice it up
a bit?

525
00:26:36,308 --> 00:26:39,010
I forgot these were
in the nightstand.

526
00:26:39,078 --> 00:26:40,979
This is gonna be fun.

527
00:26:41,046 --> 00:26:42,514
Mm-hmm. There. How's that?

528
00:26:42,581 --> 00:26:46,184
Tight, just the way I like it.
- Me, too.

529
00:26:46,252 --> 00:26:49,187
Mmm.

530
00:26:49,255 --> 00:26:50,488
Good night.

531
00:26:50,556 --> 00:26:52,724
Carlos, where you going?

532
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:54,692
To go grab a few hours sleep

533
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,362
before I have to get back
to work.

534
00:26:57,429 --> 00:27:00,064
Carlos, get back here! Carlos!

535
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:04,402
Could you at least
scratch my nose?!

536
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:08,106
Amy, that is very sweet.

537
00:27:08,174 --> 00:27:10,742
I love
the colors you used.

538
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:14,712
Oh, Danielle,
that is just beautiful.

539
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,248
Hmm.

540
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:34,265
Oh.

541
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:37,302
Evan, that is very pretty.

542
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:40,705
You did the assignment
just like I asked. Good job!

543
00:27:40,773 --> 00:27:42,207
That's not mine.

544
00:27:42,274 --> 00:27:44,676
Annie asked me
to bring hers up for her.

545
00:27:44,743 --> 00:27:46,277
This one's mine.

546
00:28:07,266 --> 00:28:09,667
Shh! Shh! Shh!
- Oh!

547
00:28:09,735 --> 00:28:11,169
Don't wake him up.

548
00:28:11,237 --> 00:28:14,038
I know. Ow!
- Come on.

549
00:28:56,282 --> 00:28:57,382
I know.

550
00:29:08,027 --> 00:29:11,162
What is that?
- Let's just go back. Let's go back.

551
00:29:21,573 --> 00:29:24,309
I heard a gunshot. It sounded
like a hunting rifle.

552
00:29:24,376 --> 00:29:27,011
Yeah, it almost hit Katherine.
- You guys all right?

553
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:29,147
Yeah, I think so.
Hey, this is a State Park.

554
00:29:29,214 --> 00:29:30,696
People aren't supposed
to be hunting here.

555
00:29:30,697 --> 00:29:32,350
Well, I guess these
guys don't care about that.

556
00:29:32,418 --> 00:29:35,486
I just wanna get out of here. Please?
- Yeah, of course.

557
00:29:35,554 --> 00:29:38,256
We'll, uh, go back and pack,
and we'll leave.

558
00:29:38,324 --> 00:29:39,791
Well, sorry, man.

559
00:29:41,627 --> 00:29:43,494
Me, too.

560
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,965
Juanita! Celia!
Get your coats on!

561
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:04,034
We're going to see daddy.

562
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:09,139
Let me see it.
- Okay, just so you know,

563
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:11,141
I should be bringing this
to the psychologist.

564
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:13,777
But I didn't, because this kind
of "self-expression"

565
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:16,813
usually gets kids expelled.
- Just let me see it.

566
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,518
Aw, hell.

567
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,186
Yeah, "aw, hell."

568
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:25,188
You got a problem here,
Karl.

569
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:27,891
Your son's got
some serious anger issues,

570
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:30,393
and you need to figure out
what's going on.

571
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:33,763
I know what's going on.
This is his mom.

572
00:30:33,831 --> 00:30:35,432
Marisa?

573
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,268
Well, why would he draw
a picture of her like this?

574
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:47,410
She left us...
Six weeks ago.

575
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:49,713
Oh.

576
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,047
Karl...

577
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:53,049
I woke up one day

578
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:55,619
to find her standing there
with her bags packed.

579
00:30:55,686 --> 00:30:58,288
She said
she was overwhelmed,

580
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,923
that she loved Evan

581
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:02,926
but she wasn't cut out
to be a mother.

582
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:07,330
So she just left?

583
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,867
So here I am, alone,

584
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:13,069
raising this boy.

585
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:18,108
And it's obvious I'm not
doing a very good job.

586
00:31:23,447 --> 00:31:25,582
You must be loving this.

587
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,918
Why?

588
00:31:27,985 --> 00:31:31,788
'Cause I did
the exact same thing to you.

589
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:34,324
Oh.

590
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,893
Yeah.

591
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:40,096
You know, I can understand
why you react the way you do

592
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:42,165
when you bump into me,

593
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,301
why it bothers you.

594
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:51,441
I never really got it
until just now.

595
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,881
I used to hope
that one day,

596
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:00,383
you would know
what this felt like,

597
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:03,186
and now that you do...

598
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:06,656
I'm so sorry.

599
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:15,565
Oh! Hey, Lynette!
- Hi!

600
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:17,901
Great office. I see you're busy.
Don't let me disturb you.

601
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,869
I just wanted
to drop off the girls

602
00:32:19,937 --> 00:32:22,172
so I could talk to Carlos
for a sec.

603
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,708
All right, girls,
have fun with Aunt Lynette.

604
00:32:30,514 --> 00:32:32,557
You think you can buy
me off with presents?

605
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:33,950
Gaby, now is not a good time.

606
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:35,919
Well, I'd say
let's talk about it tonight,

607
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:38,421
but who knows if you're
even gonna come home?

608
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:40,156
Damn it, Gaby.

609
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:42,392
You're the one that pushed me
take this job.

610
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,361
And ever since I did,

611
00:32:44,428 --> 00:32:47,364
all you've done is complain
about how hard I'm working.

612
00:32:47,431 --> 00:32:49,899
You're right, and I'm sorry.
It's just... I'm scared.

613
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:51,901
We're turning into
what we used to be.

614
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:54,471
I'm unhappy at home,

615
00:32:54,538 --> 00:32:57,240
you're always working, trying to
buy me off with presents,

616
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,509
too tired
to make me feel loved.

617
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:02,145
We've made these mistakes
before, Carlos.

618
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:05,015
For God sakes,
let's not make 'em again.

619
00:33:05,082 --> 00:33:08,018
I made
a commitment here, Gaby.

620
00:33:08,085 --> 00:33:11,521
I don't think
I can just bail.

621
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,556
I know you can't,

622
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:16,626
and that's the part
that really scares me.

623
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:20,697
We're bored.

624
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:22,666
Hey, I got you sodas,
didn't I?

625
00:33:22,733 --> 00:33:24,768
And I let you feed
the paper shredder.

626
00:33:24,835 --> 00:33:27,737
Don't you have any toys?
- No. I got a hole puncher.

627
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:30,273
Sorry. That's the best
I could do. Come on.

628
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:36,546
What about
those glass things?

629
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:38,548
They're pretty.
Can I hold one?

630
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:41,017
Oh, sweetie,
those aren't to play with,

631
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:44,387
not unless you wanna see someone
go completely bonkers.

632
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:50,694
Actually, they <i>do</i> look
like a lot of fun.

633
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:53,396
If only I had the power
to stop you...

634
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:03,340
What the hell
are you doing?!

635
00:34:03,407 --> 00:34:06,209
We're playing.
What does it look like?

636
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,316
Are these your kids?

637
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,752
'Cause they were in my office
playing with my figurines,

638
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,589
which are imported.
They're worth a lot of <i>dinero.</i>

639
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,558
Do you even understand
what I'm saying?!

640
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:22,606
What's with the yelling?

641
00:34:22,607 --> 00:34:24,527
I don't know.
I'm just as worried as you are.

642
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:27,063
Look, let me
boil it down for you.

643
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:28,365
Office? <i>Sí.</i>

644
00:34:28,432 --> 00:34:30,200
Day care? No!

645
00:34:30,267 --> 00:34:31,801
Lucy, what's going on?

646
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:33,770
Apparently, some people
don't understand

647
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,772
that this is
a place of business,

648
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,907
and they need
to keep their kids at home!

649
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:40,477
Then I guess you should
yell at me.

650
00:34:40,544 --> 00:34:43,580
These are my kids.
Come here, sweetie.

651
00:34:43,647 --> 00:34:46,049
Oh, jeez.

652
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:48,251
I, uh,
I didn't know that.

653
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:51,621
I-I thought they were hers
'cause they're...

654
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:53,523
Could you just go?

655
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,392
Um...

656
00:34:55,459 --> 00:34:57,494
I'm sorry.

657
00:34:57,561 --> 00:35:00,930
So what if they were?

658
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:04,601
That's the way you talk to people?
- I said I'm sorry.

659
00:35:04,668 --> 00:35:07,070
Look, I-I am trying so hard
to make this deal happen.

660
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:09,339
I guess the stress
is just getting to me.

661
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,508
It's getting all of us.
Maybe it's a sign

662
00:35:11,575 --> 00:35:14,477
we should change the way
we do things around here.

663
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:16,646
We are trying to play
with the big boys, Carlos.

664
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,782
Now is not the time
to pull back.

665
00:35:18,849 --> 00:35:20,784
Don't you want this company
to succeed?

666
00:35:20,851 --> 00:35:23,820
I wanna build a company
that treats its people well

667
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:26,489
and lets them go home at night
to see their families.

668
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:28,958
Look, I know I don't have
the greatest bed side manner.

669
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:31,461
But you hired me to
take this company to number one.

670
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:33,430
Now if you don't want
to do that,

671
00:35:33,497 --> 00:35:35,532
I'm probably not your girl.

672
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,201
I was just thinking
the same thing.

673
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,036
Wow.

674
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:41,704
What happened to you?

675
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:44,073
The old Carlos would
do <i>anything</i> to be the best.

676
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:47,444
I guess I'm not
the old Carlos anymore.

677
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:53,783
Fine.

678
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:02,392
Don't forget
your little animals!

679
00:36:10,343 --> 00:36:13,045
Orson,
please come upstairs.

680
00:36:13,112 --> 00:36:15,781
I know what that couch does
to your back.

681
00:36:15,849 --> 00:36:18,717
Don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.

682
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:21,720
Know you're disappointed
right now, but you have to know,

683
00:36:21,788 --> 00:36:25,224
I really do want to find
some way for you to be happy.

684
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:28,227
So do I.

685
00:36:54,487 --> 00:36:56,388
Hey, don't you want
your stuff?

686
00:36:56,456 --> 00:36:59,591
Oh, can I get it tomorrow?
I just really want to get home.

687
00:37:13,373 --> 00:37:16,909
Edie?

688
00:37:19,512 --> 00:37:21,113
I always wondered

689
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:24,149
why you were so determined
to live on Wisteria Lane.

690
00:37:26,753 --> 00:37:29,154
You said you thought
we'd be happy here,

691
00:37:29,222 --> 00:37:31,523
and I wanted to believe you.

692
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:36,495
But it turned out that you...

693
00:37:36,562 --> 00:37:40,365
just wanted to be close
to Mike Delfino.

694
00:37:42,402 --> 00:37:44,536
Who gave you that?

695
00:37:44,604 --> 00:37:47,239
Nobody gave it to me.

696
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:50,842
I did research. You think
I'm too stupid to do research?

697
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:53,645
Edie, listen.
This doesn't mean anything.

698
00:37:53,713 --> 00:37:56,648
It's all there--the accident,
Mike's acquittal,

699
00:37:56,716 --> 00:37:59,718
and even a little mention
of how...

700
00:37:59,786 --> 00:38:01,887
David <i>Dash</i>

701
00:38:01,955 --> 00:38:04,323
couldn't make it
to the funeral

702
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,525
because he had
a nervous breakdown.

703
00:38:08,027 --> 00:38:09,661
Honey, look.

704
00:38:09,729 --> 00:38:12,130
Just give me a chance
to explain.

705
00:38:12,198 --> 00:38:15,267
Oh, so <i>now</i> you want
to explain?

706
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:20,605
Okay, why don't you start

707
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,275
by explaining
why you married me?

708
00:38:26,112 --> 00:38:28,513
I married you
because I love you.

709
00:38:28,548 --> 00:38:32,184
No! You married me because
you needed a cover story

710
00:38:32,251 --> 00:38:35,187
so you could get close to
the man who killed your family.

711
00:38:35,254 --> 00:38:36,588
That's ridiculous.

712
00:38:36,656 --> 00:38:38,256
Yeah, it's insane.

713
00:38:38,324 --> 00:38:40,258
But that's why you did it.

714
00:38:40,326 --> 00:38:42,928
So what are you
gonna do now?

715
00:38:42,996 --> 00:38:45,297
You gonna hurt him?

716
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,400
I mean...

717
00:38:48,468 --> 00:38:51,436
You know, that's the only.

718
00:38:51,504 --> 00:38:53,372
Logical explanation.

719
00:38:53,439 --> 00:38:57,976
And my only question is...

720
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,445
What the hell
have you been waiting for?

721
00:39:00,513 --> 00:39:04,483
Honey,
you're not feeling well.

722
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,618
Let's get you upstairs
into bed.

723
00:39:06,686 --> 00:39:09,554
Tell me the truth,
you freak.

724
00:39:09,622 --> 00:39:13,525
Did you move us here
to hurt Mike Delfino?

725
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:19,297
He destroyed...

726
00:39:19,365 --> 00:39:22,000
everything I ever loved,

727
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,969
and he was never punished.

728
00:39:26,372 --> 00:39:30,742
I need to make things right.

729
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,811
You?

730
00:39:32,879 --> 00:39:37,315
Why did you have to do this?

731
00:39:37,383 --> 00:39:40,552
We could've been
so happy.

732
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:48,760
What are you doing?

733
00:39:48,828 --> 00:39:50,962
I'm gonna tell him before you...

734
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:53,398
Before you do something stupid.
- Edie, don't.

735
00:39:56,869 --> 00:40:00,372
Give me that.

736
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:02,808
No! Aah!

737
00:40:45,885 --> 00:40:50,055
Get out of here!
Just get the hell <i>out!</i>

738
00:40:50,123 --> 00:40:53,692
I'm calling the police!
Do you hear me?

739
00:41:04,971 --> 00:41:06,238
Aah!

740
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,174
Aah!

741
00:41:18,284 --> 00:41:22,854
<i>Yes,</i>
<i>life is full of nasty shocks.</i>

742
00:41:22,922 --> 00:41:25,290
<i>And they always seem to occur</i>

743
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:28,994
<i>when we least expect them.</i>

744
00:41:42,275 --> 00:41:45,710
<i>And once our system</i>
<i>has been jolted,</i>

745
00:41:45,778 --> 00:41:49,614
<i>the question becomes,</i>
<i>will we survive?</i>

746
00:41:54,615 --> 00:41:55,615
