NCIS Los Angeles 1x16
- Chinatown -

3
00:01:25,538 --> 00:01:28,849
If you tell me you're picking me
up at 9:00, 8:50, I'm curbside.

4
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,914
- I got caught up in something.
- What?

5
00:01:30,956 --> 00:01:33,624
You don't have a TV.
You don't read the newspaper.

6
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:35,895
You clearly don't spend
any time getting ready.

7
00:01:36,034 --> 00:01:37,581
maybe I was working out.

8
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:39,974
- You don't work out.
- I run.

9
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,895
Yeah, when people
are shooting at us.

10
00:01:42,573 --> 00:01:44,062
You know what? I slept in.

11
00:01:44,613 --> 00:01:46,382
With who?
You barely sleep.

12
00:01:46,734 --> 00:01:47,823
There's nobody.

13
00:01:47,865 --> 00:01:50,308
Come on. it would be great
for you to be in a relationship.

14
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,507
Again on this conversation?
You are my partner, not my mother

15
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:56,491
I just want you to be happy
and find a good girl.

16
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,651
Finally.

17
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,406
Nice of you gentlemen to join us.

18
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:02,355
Eric.

19
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:04,183
Calvin Lee.

20
00:02:05,285 --> 00:02:07,582
Age 31. Submarine nuclear physicist

21
00:02:07,624 --> 00:02:09,258
who just made Lieutenant Commander,

22
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,551
and was about to ship out on
a six-month deployment as the XO,

23
00:02:13,078 --> 00:02:14,062
until...

24
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:16,719
he hanged himself this morning.

25
00:02:17,353 --> 00:02:18,584
Now, the problem is

26
00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:21,906
that his sub was test-driving
a hydrophonic decoy system,

27
00:02:21,948 --> 00:02:24,585
which is a fancy way of saying
that we can now trick those

28
00:02:24,627 --> 00:02:27,063
underwater microphones
that track our subs.

29
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:31,264
with the XO dead, SECNAV wants to know
if the deployment's been compromised.

30
00:02:31,627 --> 00:02:32,459
Now...

31
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:36,327
This footage was caught
by some bachelorettes.

32
00:02:37,499 --> 00:02:41,472
Initial forensics puts the time of death
at around 6:00 a.m. This morning.

33
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,818
The suicide was pretty dramatic
and very public.

34
00:02:45,036 --> 00:02:46,707
He obviously wanted people
to see him.

35
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,439
Maybe he was making a statement.

36
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:50,336
Maybe he didn't want back
on that sub.

37
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:54,205
he worked awfully hard to become
a Lieutenant Commander at 31.

38
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:55,675
XO on a sub.

39
00:02:55,858 --> 00:02:58,511
it's a pretty big assignment.
I don't buy it.

40
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:02,515
Suicidal people usually leave a trail,
if you know what to look for.

41
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,517
Sam and I will hit the crime scene.
Kensi,

42
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:07,353
check out the house.
And bring Nate.

43
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,649
- You're actually letting me out again?
- On a short leash.

44
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,235
- And a muzzle.
- Clean up after him.

45
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,738
- You want a piece of this, too?
- Don't let him hump your leg.

46
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,041
What?

47
00:03:22,232 --> 00:03:24,084
All right, so he parked right there.

48
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,088
Tied the rope off.

49
00:03:26,943 --> 00:03:29,125
- Jumped from here.
- Or he was tossed.

50
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,046
Knot looks right for a sailor.

51
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,975
Assuming it was suicide, why here?

52
00:03:40,131 --> 00:03:43,131
I don't know. Maybe this place
has some sort of significance or

53
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,123
it's near something?

54
00:03:45,803 --> 00:03:48,102
Maybe he wanted someone
to see him when they drove by.

55
00:03:48,452 --> 00:03:51,709
Hopefully, Eric can find some
traffic cams or something

56
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,233
to shed a little light
on this thing.

57
00:04:01,132 --> 00:04:03,451
It's quite a view
for your last look at life.

58
00:04:04,214 --> 00:04:06,113
Yeah. Quite a view.

59
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:31,812
This is one squared-away sailor.

60
00:04:32,452 --> 00:04:33,731
CDs are organized

61
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,190
by artist and release date.

62
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,624
Very obsessive-compulsive.

63
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,751
You should see his sock drawer.

64
00:04:44,475 --> 00:04:46,256
This looks like a girlfriend.

65
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,501
Relationship gone sour?

66
00:04:50,747 --> 00:04:52,212
It's been known to happen.

67
00:04:52,645 --> 00:04:54,669
Of course, you'd have to be
in a relationship first.

68
00:04:55,774 --> 00:04:56,963
Was that aimed at me?

69
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,610
I'm just bustin' your...

70
00:04:59,149 --> 00:05:00,017
chops.

71
00:05:00,813 --> 00:05:03,761
Chops.
You know, how, like partners do.

72
00:05:03,989 --> 00:05:05,594
- You're not my partner.
- Right.

73
00:05:05,636 --> 00:05:07,833
- Don't make me get the muzzle.
- Cool.

74
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:41,419
NCIS.
Put your hands up.

75
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:43,821
You've got this all wrong.

76
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:46,971
Stop!

77
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,151
- Nice tackle, Urlacher.
- Nate, a little help.

78
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,317
Let me go!

79
00:06:02,606 --> 00:06:04,697
Yeah, we don't usually cuff
the suspect's feet.

80
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:05,906
Right.

81
00:06:06,602 --> 00:06:08,219
- Get off me!
- Stop!

82
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,071
- You okay?
- Yes.

83
00:06:10,113 --> 00:06:11,203
Let me go!

84
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,371
Why did you run?

85
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,622
What'd you put in here?

86
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:17,213
Looks like about two ounces of meth.

87
00:06:17,447 --> 00:06:18,919
That's why he ran so fast.

88
00:06:19,557 --> 00:06:21,380
But not fast enough.

89
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:37,293
What do we have?

90
00:06:37,335 --> 00:06:40,199
He busted into Calvin Lee's,
pinched like two, three ounces of ice,

91
00:06:40,241 --> 00:06:41,650
then booked out of there.

92
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,125
But we chased him down,
slapped some cuffs on him.

93
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,570
Kensi tackled him.
I backed her up.

94
00:06:48,103 --> 00:06:49,325
Slow down, Serpico.

95
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:51,185
- Did you question him?
- No.

96
00:06:51,227 --> 00:06:53,810
Figured we'd let him stew
for a little while and,

97
00:06:53,986 --> 00:06:55,623
it might be better if it wasn't me.

98
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:58,214
- I'll question him.
- I'll question him.

99
00:06:58,256 --> 00:06:59,140
You...

100
00:06:59,726 --> 00:07:01,712
do some deep breathing exercises.

101
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,633
You ever see her run?

102
00:07:07,613 --> 00:07:09,970
She took him down
like a cheetah on a springbok.

103
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:11,472
"A springbok"?

104
00:07:12,137 --> 00:07:13,391
I'll see you later.

105
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,184
We... hitting the streets?

106
00:07:15,397 --> 00:07:16,811
No, I'm taking you back to Ops.

107
00:07:17,073 --> 00:07:18,104
I'll drive.

108
00:07:19,323 --> 00:07:20,481
I don't think so.

109
00:07:24,426 --> 00:07:27,738
- There's a couple ways we can do this.
- I'd like access to a JAG lawyer.

110
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:33,160
- Why do you think you need a lawyer?
- I know my rights.

111
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:35,886
All right, I'll ask around.
I'll find out who has the...

112
00:07:36,075 --> 00:07:38,020
best track record for murder cases.

113
00:07:38,231 --> 00:07:39,458
I didn't kill anybody.

114
00:07:40,005 --> 00:07:40,907
So, what,

115
00:07:41,153 --> 00:07:42,759
you were Calvin Lee's meth dealer?

116
00:07:42,934 --> 00:07:45,137
You took two ounces
of meth from his house.

117
00:07:48,126 --> 00:07:49,473
All right, look, pal,

118
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:53,305
we've got 60 open cases
on our desks right now.

119
00:07:53,936 --> 00:07:56,892
We've got a dead body,
illegal drugs, and you.

120
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:00,062
Easiest thing for us
to do is just walk away.

121
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:03,052
if you want us to keep digging
and find something that might prove

122
00:08:03,094 --> 00:08:04,721
you innocent along the way,

123
00:08:05,637 --> 00:08:07,945
you've got to give us
a reason to keep looking.

124
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:15,983
Calvin got a promotion
to Lieutenant Commander,

125
00:08:16,241 --> 00:08:17,955
then a great billet as an XO.

126
00:08:18,186 --> 00:08:21,083
So let me guess.
You were next in line?

127
00:08:21,294 --> 00:08:22,751
It was a career-maker.

128
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:24,545
Calvin was a jerk.

129
00:08:24,798 --> 00:08:26,464
He was moody, curt, secretive.

130
00:08:26,954 --> 00:08:28,382
That job was mine.

131
00:08:28,736 --> 00:08:30,759
My men worked
their asses off for me.

132
00:08:32,618 --> 00:08:35,723
For the past week, I've been spiking
his soda with methamphetamines.

133
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,224
Just small amounts.

134
00:08:38,173 --> 00:08:40,269
So, what, he fail a drug test?

135
00:08:42,596 --> 00:08:43,898
You can't taste it.

136
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,170
It feels like a caffeine high.

137
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,612
With a big tour,
they do a drug test of the whole crew.

138
00:08:49,944 --> 00:08:51,830
Between a urinalysis and a search,

139
00:08:51,872 --> 00:08:54,283
If he'd get bumped off the boat,
the job would go to me.

140
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:57,150
But you didn't count
on him killing himself.

141
00:08:57,192 --> 00:08:58,454
I didn't like Calvin.

142
00:08:58,781 --> 00:09:00,297
But I didn't want him dead.

143
00:09:00,877 --> 00:09:02,681
And now there's an investigation.

144
00:09:03,642 --> 00:09:05,669
I went there to undo
some of the damage.

145
00:09:06,068 --> 00:09:06,818
No.

146
00:09:07,345 --> 00:09:09,092
You went back to cover your ass.

147
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,529
Unfortunately for you,
it was too late.

148
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:15,262
Now, Calvin Lee is dead
because of you.

149
00:09:19,178 --> 00:09:21,481
Trace amounts of blood
on his left shoe.

150
00:09:21,523 --> 00:09:23,726
Preliminary tox screen just came in.

151
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,269
Looks like he was positive
for methamphetamines,

152
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:29,410
but Calvin Lee did not blow
a drug test.

153
00:09:29,621 --> 00:09:31,737
In fact,
he hasn't had a urinalysis in some time.

154
00:09:32,012 --> 00:09:33,840
That means nobody
but his shipmate, Vic,

155
00:09:33,882 --> 00:09:36,970
knew that he had amphetamines in his
system. And if Vic's telling the truth,

156
00:09:37,121 --> 00:09:38,551
Calvin Lee didn't know.

157
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,473
That's probably not
why he offed himself.

158
00:09:40,515 --> 00:09:43,555
Nothing in his medical file
about depression or mental illness.

159
00:09:43,695 --> 00:09:45,523
So we could be looking at a murder?

160
00:09:45,816 --> 00:09:47,753
What are the chances
this isn't a suicide?

161
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,338
I'd say zero percent.

162
00:09:49,657 --> 00:09:51,340
What do you know that we don't?

163
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:53,592
The words to every TV theme song.

164
00:09:55,293 --> 00:09:56,383
And this.

165
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:01,016
Caltrans traffic operator
saw him on the bridge

166
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,832
and zoomed in for a closer look.

167
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,258
It's definitely Calvin Lee.

168
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,145
And he's alone.

169
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,608
The body language says
no signs of duress.

170
00:10:09,805 --> 00:10:11,727
He came with the noose already tied.

171
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,826
I'd say that's pretty conclusive.

172
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,864
What was that he threw off
the bridge?

173
00:10:31,818 --> 00:10:33,424
Maybe he was throwing his gum out?

174
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,553
you wouldn't want to choke on your gum
before you strangle yourself to death.

175
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,097
- I don't know.
- Clearly.

176
00:10:42,688 --> 00:10:46,103
Can you pay Lee's parents a visit?
We are going back to the crime scene.

177
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:01,916
Have fun, guys.

178
00:11:02,867 --> 00:11:03,845
Okay.

179
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,778
Should I get a gun?

180
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:07,681
- Have you ever carried a weapon?
- No.

181
00:11:07,723 --> 00:11:09,616
Fired a weapon?
Been trained with a weapon?

182
00:11:09,658 --> 00:11:11,248
Then you probably won't need one.

183
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:14,089
And the parents will be mourning
over their dead son.

184
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:17,701
Which is why you're bringing
an operational psychologist with you.

185
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,012
Copy that.

186
00:11:21,762 --> 00:11:24,475
We're very sorry for your loss,
Mr. and Mrs. Lee.

187
00:11:24,841 --> 00:11:26,920
Did Calvin ever share
with you any trouble

188
00:11:26,962 --> 00:11:30,428
he was having at work,
in relationships?

189
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,275
- Was he depressed?
- No, no, no.

190
00:11:33,849 --> 00:11:35,486
Calvin was a perfect son.

191
00:11:36,305 --> 00:11:37,225
Always.

192
00:11:37,969 --> 00:11:39,534
School, Navy...

193
00:11:40,228 --> 00:11:41,028
He...

194
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:44,671
He was always trying to do his best.

195
00:11:45,284 --> 00:11:48,625
We gave up everything
to come here and have our son.

196
00:11:49,338 --> 00:11:50,346
And now,...

197
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:53,504
- he's gone.
- You left China?

198
00:11:53,904 --> 00:11:56,161
We had a daughter
when Ming was pregnant.

199
00:11:57,451 --> 00:11:59,468
But we were only allowed one child.

200
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,596
- Was your daughter close with Calvin?
- When they were younger.

201
00:12:03,237 --> 00:12:05,766
But she's...
She's gone. She...

202
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,226
she died a long time ago.

203
00:12:07,985 --> 00:12:09,929
We're very sorry to hear that.

204
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:15,609
Can you think of any reason
why Calvin would take his own life?

205
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:17,847
No, it must be a mistake.

206
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:19,819
Tell me something...

207
00:12:21,386 --> 00:12:22,616
Is this your daughter?

208
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,452
No. This is Xue-Li,

209
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:28,122
our son's fiancée.

210
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:30,833
Do you know where we could find her?

211
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,744
Well, she's very upset. She said
she's going back to Hong Kong

212
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,546
to be with her family,
leaving immediately.

213
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,325
Perhaps we could have
this conversation a little later?

214
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:45,556
My wife and I, we...

215
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,752
- we need more time.
- Absolutely.

216
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,102
We understand.

217
00:12:51,325 --> 00:12:52,927
Maybe we're over thinking this.

218
00:12:52,969 --> 00:12:56,318
Maybe his death doesn't have anything
to do with the sub's decoy system.

219
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,402
Maybe he just got
in a fight with his girlfriend.

220
00:12:59,016 --> 00:13:00,839
- Selfish.
- What's that?

221
00:13:01,803 --> 00:13:02,868
Suicide.

222
00:13:03,698 --> 00:13:06,598
You're basically leaving
everybody else to clean up your mess.

223
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:08,829
You all right, big guy?

224
00:13:09,076 --> 00:13:10,372
You know what today is?

225
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:11,582
Wednesday.

226
00:13:11,739 --> 00:13:12,833
It's Tuesday.

227
00:13:13,165 --> 00:13:14,290
You sure?

228
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,146
Feels like a Wednesday.

229
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:19,840
Five weeks to the day
since Dom went missing.

230
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:22,634
And we're here picking
through roadside trash,

231
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,387
'cause some distraught
meatball offed himself.

232
00:13:25,692 --> 00:13:28,627
Sam, if we had
something new to go on,

233
00:13:28,781 --> 00:13:31,337
anything new, anything at all,
we'd be on it 24/7.

234
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:34,229
- You know that, but we've got nothing.
- And it's going to stay that way

235
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,056
as long as we're out here
wasting our time

236
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:38,108
- with this things.
- It isn't a waste of time.

237
00:13:38,282 --> 00:13:40,267
The security of the men
and the technology

238
00:13:40,309 --> 00:13:42,178
on that submarine
remain in question.

239
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,073
Besides that,
Calvin Lee has a family.

240
00:13:46,335 --> 00:13:48,577
At the very least,
we're going to give them closure.

241
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,699
That's the same thing we're going
to do for Dom's family someday.

242
00:13:55,577 --> 00:13:57,717
Ming and Jun Lee immigrated here

243
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,324
in February of 1979
with their daughter Jane.

244
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,591
She was two years old at the time.

245
00:14:02,907 --> 00:14:05,802
Calvin, their son, was born
six months later at County.

246
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:09,723
They've been running the same antique
store in Chinatown for over 30 years.

247
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,267
- When did the daughter pass away?
- She didn't.

248
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,592
The parents said she died years ago.

249
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:17,564
No death certificate on record,
but I did find this.

250
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,469
Jane Lipsger, formally Jane Lee

251
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:24,358
now living in the arts district

252
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,241
where she owns her own eclectic
hard metal furniture shop.

253
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,425
- She got married?
- Nope. Just changed her name.

254
00:14:31,033 --> 00:14:32,374
Why would the parents lie?

255
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,634
And why would she change
her name to Lipsger?

256
00:14:35,392 --> 00:14:37,511
I think it's time
somebody asked her.

257
00:14:38,301 --> 00:14:40,754
Whatever it was,
it meant something to him.

258
00:14:40,906 --> 00:14:42,966
And he didn't want it
found on his body.

259
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,520
What are
the circumstances that leads

260
00:14:47,562 --> 00:14:50,406
to someone throwing a toilet seat out
of a moving vehicle?

261
00:14:50,448 --> 00:14:52,644
Kind of stretches
the imagination, don't it?

262
00:14:54,652 --> 00:14:55,978
Christmas lights...

263
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,604
a <i>Cats</i> CD...

264
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:01,460
Oh, this is interesting. I may actually
take this one back to dust for prints.

265
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,543
Just out of curiosity.

266
00:15:05,836 --> 00:15:08,282
I do not want to meet
the owner of this shoe.

267
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,534
It's a size 15.

268
00:15:11,246 --> 00:15:13,328
- That's a lot of woman.
- Maybe.

269
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,305
Hello.

270
00:15:22,825 --> 00:15:24,405
Right place, right size.

271
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,271
That's his parting shot
to the world?

272
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,889
I'm gonna throw over my keys
so no one can move my car?

273
00:15:33,337 --> 00:15:35,341
Like I said: selfish.

274
00:15:40,938 --> 00:15:42,232
Yeah, we're on it.

275
00:15:42,521 --> 00:15:44,902
Eric just found Calvin Lee's sister
in the arts district.

276
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,126
You know what I like
about metal furniture?

277
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:56,663
Who are you kidding? What do you know
about designing furniture?

278
00:15:57,079 --> 00:15:58,540
I dabble in things.

279
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,649
You do things.
You break things.

280
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,935
You don't dabble in things.

281
00:16:04,545 --> 00:16:06,173
- You don't.
- Can I help you?

282
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:08,177
That depends.

283
00:16:08,655 --> 00:16:10,344
If you're Jane Lipsger

284
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:11,320
or Lee.

285
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:12,763
And you are?

286
00:16:13,043 --> 00:16:15,891
I'm Callen. This is Sam.
We're with NCIS.

287
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:17,476
Which means what exactly?

288
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,933
Naval Criminal
Investigative Service.

289
00:16:20,448 --> 00:16:22,773
We'd like to ask you some questions
about your brother Calvin.

290
00:16:23,538 --> 00:16:24,691
What about him?

291
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,360
When you spoke with him?

292
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,029
Why?
What's going on?

293
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,327
I'm afraid he died early
this morning.

294
00:16:42,422 --> 00:16:44,378
I'm sorry we had
to be the ones to tell you.

295
00:16:46,332 --> 00:16:47,091
How?

296
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:53,178
It appears he took his own life.

297
00:17:08,998 --> 00:17:10,606
Calvin called me last night.

298
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,489
Left a message on my machine.

299
00:17:13,016 --> 00:17:15,634
He sounded drunk,
which wasn't like him.

300
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:19,287
He was saying goodbye, but I figured
it was just because he was shipping out.

301
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:20,872
You two were close?

302
00:17:21,671 --> 00:17:23,231
We talked almost every day.

303
00:17:25,432 --> 00:17:29,047
Even if I hate my parents, I have
an irrational need to hear how they are.

304
00:17:31,327 --> 00:17:33,119
I make fun of him, but...

305
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:36,018
he's really a great brother.

306
00:17:37,635 --> 00:17:40,063
He was the good son.
You were the rebel.

307
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,716
I was a terror.

308
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,771
But they had it coming.

309
00:17:45,414 --> 00:17:48,314
Old school Chinese parents
live for their sons.

310
00:17:49,827 --> 00:17:51,653
Mine were a Jihua family.

311
00:17:52,548 --> 00:17:55,550
We left China because
of <i>Jihua Shengyu Zhenzi</i>...

312
00:17:56,152 --> 00:17:57,576
the one-child policy.

313
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:01,963
I think they resented leaving.

314
00:18:03,265 --> 00:18:05,333
And then they only had eyes for him.

315
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:10,338
You know what they call
baby girls in China?

316
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,582
<i>Qu zai mifan</i>...

317
00:18:16,525 --> 00:18:18,147
Maggots in rice.

318
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,178
Do you have any idea

319
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,353
why Calvin
would have killed himself?

320
00:18:27,588 --> 00:18:28,899
He seemed to have it all:

321
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:30,863
Lieutenant Commander,

322
00:18:31,622 --> 00:18:32,331
XO,

323
00:18:33,735 --> 00:18:35,190
beautiful fiancée.

324
00:18:36,641 --> 00:18:37,544
Fiancée?

325
00:18:44,037 --> 00:18:46,208
Xue-Li.
That's a joke.

326
00:18:46,888 --> 00:18:49,341
It was an arranged marriage
my parents were trying to force on him.

327
00:18:49,383 --> 00:18:51,531
He wanted nothing to do with her.
Trust me.

328
00:18:52,157 --> 00:18:53,048
Why is that?

329
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:58,778
Because Calvin...

330
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,204
didn't like girls.

331
00:19:04,221 --> 00:19:05,021
Women.

332
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:07,729
He liked men.

333
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,190
He was very discreet.
My parents had no idea.

334
00:19:10,327 --> 00:19:11,959
He was in a relationship.

335
00:19:12,389 --> 00:19:13,701
His name's Jaxson.

336
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:15,426
It wasn't easy.

337
00:19:15,744 --> 00:19:16,897
Calvin took the

338
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:20,170
"don't ask, don't tell"
stuff very seriously and Jaxson...

339
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,035
really didn't.

340
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:26,344
There were a lot of ups
and a lot of downs.

341
00:19:30,508 --> 00:19:32,440
The gay Lieutenant Commander.

342
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,843
Think his mom knew?

343
00:19:36,728 --> 00:19:38,969
- Don't moms know these things?
- You tell me.

344
00:19:40,234 --> 00:19:42,264
- No mom.
- That's why you need me.

345
00:19:42,694 --> 00:19:44,211
This is funny.

346
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,198
Mr. Jaxson!

347
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,712
Mr. Jaxson, you there?

348
00:19:56,926 --> 00:19:58,083
You around?

349
00:20:12,285 --> 00:20:14,260
Doesn't look like love to me.

350
00:20:20,327 --> 00:20:22,519
- They find the weapon?
- Not yet.

351
00:20:23,815 --> 00:20:26,391
- None of the neighbors heard anything.
- Well, they seldom do.

352
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,269
No signs of forced entry.

353
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,065
Only one set of footprints.

354
00:20:34,413 --> 00:20:37,569
It's probably the blood found
on Lieutenant Commander Lee's shoes.

355
00:20:37,896 --> 00:20:40,363
So I'm thinking he slits
the guy's throat,

356
00:20:40,868 --> 00:20:43,209
tosses a few back,
realizing what he's done,

357
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,977
then hangs himself at first light.

358
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,388
So we call it a crime of passion,
murder-suicide?

359
00:20:50,805 --> 00:20:53,335
If he killed this guy,
that explains why he hanged himself.

360
00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:55,609
Well, it explains the suicide.

361
00:20:56,285 --> 00:20:58,423
Now we got to figure out the murder.

362
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,537
Coroner's report confirms
the presence

363
00:21:00,579 --> 00:21:02,899
of methamphetamines
in Calvin Lee's system, but

364
00:21:02,941 --> 00:21:04,896
no signs of actual meth use:

365
00:21:04,938 --> 00:21:07,515
Needle marks,
meth mouth, lung damage.

366
00:21:07,695 --> 00:21:09,803
Which is consistent
with his shipmate's story.

367
00:21:09,845 --> 00:21:12,946
The main cause of suicide in the armed
services: clinical depression,

368
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:15,595
relationship problems, deployment,
or combat stress.

369
00:21:15,637 --> 00:21:17,859
There's not much combat stress
in a sub deployment.

370
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,612
- And no history of depression.
- Which leaves relationships.

371
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,299
And this guy was hiding his relationship
from a lot of people.

372
00:21:24,245 --> 00:21:26,922
This is the surveillance footage
from Jaxson's building.

373
00:21:26,964 --> 00:21:28,550
Calvin let himself in last night,

374
00:21:28,592 --> 00:21:30,838
and then left in a hurry,
eight minutes later.

375
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,148
That's enough time to kill Jaxson.

376
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,000
Motive?

377
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:35,808
Any number of reasons.

378
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,413
If Jaxson wasn't discreet,

379
00:21:37,455 --> 00:21:40,257
that would put Calvin's career
and family ties on the line.

380
00:21:40,954 --> 00:21:41,758
Or maybe

381
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,138
Calvin just wanted out, you know?

382
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:45,812
He's about to deploy.

383
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:47,555
He thinks it's best to just end it.

384
00:21:47,722 --> 00:21:50,558
Jaxson refuses to let him go
and threatens to out Calvin.

385
00:21:50,745 --> 00:21:53,603
- But still no murder weapon.
- Maybe he took it with him.

386
00:21:53,835 --> 00:21:56,272
He'd have had to drop his weapon
somewhere between the crime scene

387
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:57,357
and the overpass.

388
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,943
Look at what he's wearing.
He didn't change.

389
00:22:00,394 --> 00:22:01,836
You saw that blood splatter.

390
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:03,771
How could he manage to kill this guy

391
00:22:03,813 --> 00:22:06,908
and get the knife out of the building
without getting blood on himself?

392
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,326
Eric, scroll back.

393
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:11,452
It's 6:00 at night,
people are coming and going.

394
00:22:11,843 --> 00:22:13,156
Dog walkin' time.

395
00:22:16,397 --> 00:22:19,421
- Busy apartment building.
- Go back to the delivery guy.

396
00:22:19,822 --> 00:22:22,272
Gotta get past
all the nosy neighbors.

397
00:22:24,661 --> 00:22:25,844
No one buzzed him in.

398
00:22:27,135 --> 00:22:29,431
And he leaves in a hurry.
Can barely see his face.

399
00:22:29,862 --> 00:22:31,683
Purposely exits away from camera.

400
00:22:32,613 --> 00:22:33,852
That's our guy.

401
00:22:34,568 --> 00:22:35,687
Let's check it out.

402
00:22:45,457 --> 00:22:48,084
No one had Chinese food
delivery last night.

403
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:49,981
It's 'cause it never got delivered.

404
00:22:50,023 --> 00:22:52,495
He just needed this to get access
to the apartment building.

405
00:22:54,063 --> 00:22:55,963
"Jolly Chan's Chinese food."

406
00:22:56,457 --> 00:22:58,207
It's guaranteed MSG-free.

407
00:22:59,082 --> 00:23:00,790
<i>Jolly Chan</i> is in Chinatown,

408
00:23:00,832 --> 00:23:03,356
and while they have
an excellent kung pao chicken,

409
00:23:03,398 --> 00:23:06,405
they don't deliver to West Hollywood
or anywhere near Jaxson's apartment.

410
00:23:06,447 --> 00:23:07,280
Okay.

411
00:23:07,911 --> 00:23:11,135
If the person who ordered
the food used a credit card,

412
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:15,311
we might be able to get a name
by matching the contents of the order

413
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:17,568
to the restaurant's
takeout receipts.

414
00:23:18,934 --> 00:23:20,482
We've created a monster.

415
00:23:21,162 --> 00:23:23,359
What, that's...
that's not good detective work?

416
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:28,323
You might start by checking the bag
and its contents for fingerprints.

417
00:23:29,556 --> 00:23:31,172
Sure, we could do that.

418
00:23:31,554 --> 00:23:32,704
Which we did.

419
00:23:33,993 --> 00:23:34,871
Bobby Tang:

420
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,864
he runs an import/export company
out of West Adams, and

421
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,820
he's got a mug shot.

422
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:42,924
Emphasis on mug.

423
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,130
He's a member
of the Asian gang Hiragana.

424
00:23:46,172 --> 00:23:48,920
They're one of the most dangerous
and organized gangs in L.A.

425
00:23:49,268 --> 00:23:50,667
Suspected homicide:

426
00:23:50,787 --> 00:23:54,745
torching a business associate's store
with the business associate still in it.

427
00:23:55,378 --> 00:23:57,894
I'd say he possesses
the necessary skill set.

428
00:23:58,093 --> 00:23:59,312
Let's pay him a visit.

429
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:07,570
Hetty, can I ask you a...?

430
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,363
No!

431
00:24:09,629 --> 00:24:11,783
You didn't even know
I was gonna ask.

432
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:13,609
Will it cost me money?

433
00:24:14,175 --> 00:24:15,453
I don't think so.

434
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,705
Does it involve any legal issues?

435
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:21,376
No, no. I just want to ask you
a hypothetical question.

436
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,172
- You mean, like a riddle?
- Sure.

437
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,524
Ask away.

438
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:30,985
Have you ever known
an operational psychologist

439
00:24:31,281 --> 00:24:33,006
who became an agent?

440
00:24:48,745 --> 00:24:50,248
Kerwood Ames,

441
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,739
a brilliant man.

442
00:24:52,017 --> 00:24:54,978
He pioneered
several profiling techniques.

443
00:24:56,781 --> 00:24:58,121
Is he still with the agency?

444
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:01,492
No, he was killed
in his second week on the job.

445
00:25:01,594 --> 00:25:03,084
Or was it his second day?

446
00:25:05,047 --> 00:25:07,303
Ames had a gifted mind,

447
00:25:07,345 --> 00:25:09,340
but he tended to think logically.

448
00:25:10,574 --> 00:25:11,585
Invaluable

449
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:14,823
for a scientist,
not so much for an agent.

450
00:25:14,865 --> 00:25:17,237
Choices they make on the street

451
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,017
don't always seem to make sense

452
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:20,727
to the untrained eye,

453
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:23,104
which is probably
what keeps them alive.

454
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:25,043
Why do you ask?

455
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,836
Just... just curious.

456
00:25:29,143 --> 00:25:31,154
Admirable quality... curiosity.

457
00:25:32,774 --> 00:25:34,747
Unless, of course, you're a cat.

458
00:25:42,152 --> 00:25:44,477
So this is Bobby Tang's company.

459
00:25:49,149 --> 00:25:50,414
You bring the lock pick?

460
00:25:55,935 --> 00:25:56,816
That works.

461
00:26:10,938 --> 00:26:13,429
Looks like our buddy Bobby Tang
is a video pirate.

462
00:26:14,086 --> 00:26:14,795
No.

463
00:26:15,601 --> 00:26:16,434
What?

464
00:26:16,677 --> 00:26:19,116
I know what you want to say...
don't do it.

465
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,843
You don't like my pirate impression?

466
00:26:44,815 --> 00:26:47,355
I guess Xue-Li didn't go back
to Hong Kong after all.

467
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,984
What's she doing with Bobby Tang?

468
00:26:51,247 --> 00:26:53,444
I don't know,
but she looks like she's in trouble.

469
00:26:59,972 --> 00:27:00,839
Look out!

470
00:27:05,843 --> 00:27:08,126
Throw the weapon down!
Drop it! Down!

471
00:27:08,589 --> 00:27:10,503
Drop your weapon!
Down on the ground!

472
00:27:11,327 --> 00:27:12,218
Get down!

473
00:27:42,977 --> 00:27:43,828
You okay?

474
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,100
Where'd they come from?

475
00:27:46,142 --> 00:27:47,506
And where'd she go?

476
00:27:58,671 --> 00:28:00,381
That guy got me in the face.

477
00:28:00,838 --> 00:28:03,581
And I'm not even gonna tell you
where the guy upstairs got me.

478
00:28:03,623 --> 00:28:05,405
I think the guy in the hospital
bit me.

479
00:28:05,554 --> 00:28:09,328
I see the Ice and Aspirin Club
is at it again.

480
00:28:09,949 --> 00:28:11,847
Every time I come here,

481
00:28:12,011 --> 00:28:15,151
I feel like I've stepped
into a damn Hardy Boys' novel.

482
00:28:16,276 --> 00:28:17,753
I gather that

483
00:28:17,795 --> 00:28:20,031
you couldn't talk your way
out of this one?

484
00:28:20,225 --> 00:28:22,784
We had a little bit
of a language barrier.

485
00:28:23,027 --> 00:28:25,125
And an "I want you dead" barrier.

486
00:28:28,787 --> 00:28:29,631
That...

487
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:31,623
knife we got off Bobby Tang...

488
00:28:31,998 --> 00:28:34,260
Forensics says it looks like a match

489
00:28:34,418 --> 00:28:37,256
with the one that killed
Calvin Lee's boyfriend Jaxson.

490
00:28:37,478 --> 00:28:39,592
- And Xue-Li?
- In the wind.

491
00:28:39,947 --> 00:28:42,349
I alerted Border Patrol
and local law enforcement.

492
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,777
What have we learned from "the Three
Stooges" you took into custody?

493
00:28:46,843 --> 00:28:48,601
We're not sure they speak English.

494
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,367
Leave them to me.

495
00:28:52,257 --> 00:28:54,577
<i>Woe mon yoe-banfa</i>

496
00:28:54,964 --> 00:28:56,909
<i>zjan ta-men shuo.</i>

497
00:28:57,823 --> 00:28:59,428
- What's that mean?
- It means,

498
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:02,198
"We have ways of making them talk."

499
00:29:05,757 --> 00:29:07,497
You're next, Mr. Callen.

500
00:29:09,767 --> 00:29:13,412
We don't know what we're dealing with.
Could be espionage, could be anything.

501
00:29:15,133 --> 00:29:16,421
What do we have, Kensi?

502
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:22,308
Bobby Tang delivers Chinese food
to West Hollywood and kills Jaxson.

503
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:24,262
Calvin finds Jaxson's body,

504
00:29:24,504 --> 00:29:25,535
hangs himself.

505
00:29:25,676 --> 00:29:27,527
Bobby confronts Xue-Li,

506
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:29,783
who... two-taps him in the chest.

507
00:29:29,825 --> 00:29:32,186
Xue-Li's the only one alive.
What do we have on her?

508
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:34,814
Supposedly she was brought here
for an arranged marriage.

509
00:29:35,538 --> 00:29:36,441
From where?

510
00:29:36,815 --> 00:29:39,745
She's not exactly a well-behaved
mail-order bride.

511
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,779
She handled that Glock like a pro.

512
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:44,282
I'll speak to the parents,
find out how they met her.

513
00:29:44,765 --> 00:29:47,132
Maybe they know something
they don't realize they know.

514
00:29:52,383 --> 00:29:53,499
You'd like to come?

515
00:29:54,607 --> 00:29:56,739
- Do you want me to?
- You don't want to be out?

516
00:29:57,678 --> 00:29:58,873
No, I do, I do.

517
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:00,798
I should stay.

518
00:30:01,048 --> 00:30:03,134
I got a lot of paperwork...

519
00:30:03,685 --> 00:30:05,302
logical stuff,

520
00:30:05,653 --> 00:30:07,557
Kerwood Ames issue...

521
00:30:11,448 --> 00:30:12,810
What are we missing, Sam?

522
00:30:14,161 --> 00:30:15,297
I don't know.

523
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,200
What Dom would say?

524
00:30:29,723 --> 00:30:30,602
Probably...

525
00:30:31,592 --> 00:30:34,580
give us some obscure historical fact
about God knows what.

526
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:39,063
Did you know Leonardo DaVinci
was the first person

527
00:30:39,105 --> 00:30:42,323
to design the submarine
in the 15th century

528
00:30:42,365 --> 00:30:44,550
and he was also the first inventor

529
00:30:44,758 --> 00:30:46,961
to think to combine
existing machines

530
00:30:47,101 --> 00:30:49,586
to create new and improved ones?

531
00:30:56,702 --> 00:30:58,682
How do we know this is just a key?

532
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:13,403
Mrs. Lee, sorry to bother you again,
but we have a few more questions.

533
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:14,956
Jun is not here.

534
00:31:15,386 --> 00:31:17,296
That's okay.
I'm sure you can help.

535
00:31:18,392 --> 00:31:20,255
I prefer my husband to be here.

536
00:31:20,871 --> 00:31:21,670
Why?

537
00:31:22,786 --> 00:31:24,090
He's the strong one.

538
00:31:25,522 --> 00:31:28,100
You said Calvin's fiancée, Xue-Li,
went back to Hong Kong.

539
00:31:29,606 --> 00:31:30,888
But she didn't.

540
00:31:31,405 --> 00:31:32,354
Did she?

541
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,147
You need to wait for my husband.
I can't talk about it.

542
00:31:40,386 --> 00:31:43,192
Because you don't want to
or because he won't let you?

543
00:31:47,377 --> 00:31:49,533
Okay,
I don't usually get this excited,

544
00:31:50,061 --> 00:31:52,118
but this is cool on so many levels.

545
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:53,786
I take it it's not a car key.

546
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,496
<i>Au contraire, mon frère</i>.

547
00:31:55,803 --> 00:31:57,748
It is and so much more.

548
00:31:58,334 --> 00:31:59,927
It's a high-tech cloner.

549
00:32:00,068 --> 00:32:02,169
It's like an IronClad flash drive,

550
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,235
just jacked up on steroids.

551
00:32:04,376 --> 00:32:06,684
It only needs to be
in the vicinity of a computer,

552
00:32:06,726 --> 00:32:08,952
and it relays the information
to a remote location.

553
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:12,433
Look at this thing. You can disguise
this as any everyday object.

554
00:32:12,837 --> 00:32:15,099
Just leave it
near someone's computer,

555
00:32:15,632 --> 00:32:17,101
all her secrets are revealed.

556
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,645
This one, interestingly enough,
never been used.

557
00:32:20,185 --> 00:32:22,845
Why would the Navy
give Calvin a jacked-up IronClad?

558
00:32:23,495 --> 00:32:24,900
I don't think they did.

559
00:32:25,521 --> 00:32:28,310
I mean, I can't be totally sure
how any of this works,

560
00:32:28,977 --> 00:32:30,700
because most of the code

561
00:32:31,345 --> 00:32:32,610
looks like this.

562
00:32:33,407 --> 00:32:34,368
Chinese?

563
00:32:34,918 --> 00:32:36,102
Military grade.

564
00:32:36,925 --> 00:32:39,503
Nothing this sophisticated's
even on our radar.

565
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,500
If this came
from the People's Republic

566
00:32:41,695 --> 00:32:43,336
and wound up on that sub...

567
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,445
Every piece
of classified information

568
00:32:45,487 --> 00:32:48,144
and new technology on that mission
would be compromised...

569
00:32:49,655 --> 00:32:51,671
and available to our enemies.

570
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,181
Calvin Lee was a Chinese spy.

571
00:33:04,844 --> 00:33:07,293
Calvin's shipmate Vic
did say that he was

572
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,602
secretive, nervous,

573
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,664
a loner.

574
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:14,043
I would be too
if I were betraying my country.

575
00:33:14,206 --> 00:33:15,788
Imagine living every day wondering

576
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:18,386
if you're about to be caught,
constantly looking over your shoulder.

577
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,290
Imagine that.

578
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,629
Maybe he thought
he was about to be made.

579
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:27,630
Could explain the suicide.

580
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:29,607
Yeah, but why toss this?

581
00:33:30,087 --> 00:33:32,802
Why not hide it first?
Give it to your handlers?

582
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:35,194
Maybe the Lieutenant Commander

583
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:38,099
is sending a message from the grave.

584
00:33:38,395 --> 00:33:41,313
Historically,
traitors were hung from bridges

585
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:44,605
- as a warning to others.
- Calvin didn't want to be a traitor.

586
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,400
That's why the cloner had never
been used. 'cause Calvin refused.

587
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,903
So the Chinese threatened him
with the best currency they had.

588
00:33:51,282 --> 00:33:53,364
His one vulnerability, his boyfriend

589
00:33:53,556 --> 00:33:54,341
Jaxson.

590
00:33:55,073 --> 00:33:57,368
Only Bobby Tang went too far:
he killed him.

591
00:33:57,556 --> 00:33:58,900
So with nowhere else to turn,

592
00:33:58,942 --> 00:34:01,564
suicide is the final act of defiance
against his tormentors.

593
00:34:02,059 --> 00:34:03,641
That explains why he tossed this.

594
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:07,315
So maybe Mr. Lee was a true patriot.

595
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:08,979
Died for his country.

596
00:34:09,021 --> 00:34:11,694
With the operation blown, the only thing
left to do for his handlers

597
00:34:11,736 --> 00:34:13,736
was clean up the mess
and cover your tracks,

598
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,416
starting with Bobby Tang.

599
00:34:15,568 --> 00:34:18,252
Xue-Li,
pretending to be his arranged bride,

600
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:21,328
but really a pro brought in
from the home office

601
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:22,768
to get things done.

602
00:34:22,997 --> 00:34:25,003
That's why we have
no back story on her.

603
00:34:25,045 --> 00:34:26,139
She's a shooter.

604
00:34:26,876 --> 00:34:29,483
- Now she's tying up her loose ends.
- Which are?

605
00:34:29,691 --> 00:34:31,085
Anyone who may have known.

606
00:34:31,127 --> 00:34:32,796
Probably starting with the family.

607
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:35,852
And any one of them
could be an asset to us, so

608
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,685
they're all in danger.

609
00:34:40,685 --> 00:34:42,244
How did you meet Xue-Li?

610
00:34:42,286 --> 00:34:44,312
Her family was friends of Jun's...

611
00:34:44,354 --> 00:34:46,069
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

612
00:34:46,408 --> 00:34:48,502
- Yeah.
<i>- Get Calvin's parents out of there.</i>

613
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,129
Callen and Sam think that Xue-Li

614
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,906
<i>is going to try to kill them.</i>

615
00:34:52,984 --> 00:34:54,156
Okay, got it.

616
00:34:54,812 --> 00:34:56,093
Get out of here right now.

617
00:34:56,307 --> 00:34:58,956
- To go where? We have customers.
- Mr. Lee, you are in danger.

618
00:34:58,998 --> 00:35:01,182
I must move you
someplace safe immediately.

619
00:35:01,344 --> 00:35:03,809
This is our store, our neighborhood.
There is no danger.

620
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,519
Xue-Li might come here to kill you.

621
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:08,315
- Let's go to the back door.
- Look, I need to lock up.

622
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:10,099
Mr. Lee,
we don't have time for this.

623
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:15,946
I got it.

624
00:35:16,146 --> 00:35:17,693
Sorry, I have to do this.

625
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:23,454
Jun!
No, no! Jun, stop!

626
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:37,852
Eric, Jun just tried to kill me
and his wife.

627
00:35:38,021 --> 00:35:39,005
I need backup.

628
00:35:39,263 --> 00:35:40,681
I'm calling LAPD

629
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:42,681
and sending your GPS
to Callen and Sam.

630
00:35:49,351 --> 00:35:51,107
<i>Eric, Xue-Li is after us.</i>

631
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:52,733
<i>Where's our backup?</i>

632
00:35:58,448 --> 00:35:59,949
Kensi's in trouble.

633
00:36:07,485 --> 00:36:09,559
I'm in a Chinese restaurant
called Foo Chow.

634
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,211
I need an exit strategy
to get back to my car on Broadway.

635
00:36:12,414 --> 00:36:14,296
I'm loading the pictometry
of the building.

636
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:18,050
Come on. Come on.

637
00:36:21,935 --> 00:36:23,060
<i>Okay, I got you.</i>

638
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:27,017
<i>Don't go out the front. Take the side
door left. It leads into the market.</i>

639
00:36:42,558 --> 00:36:44,398
I need eyes on Jun and Xue-Li.

640
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:45,870
I'm looking.

641
00:36:50,902 --> 00:36:51,793
<i>I got him.</i>

642
00:36:52,249 --> 00:36:54,003
<i>Jun's at your 6:00, closing in fast.</i>

643
00:37:04,235 --> 00:37:05,139
Stay down.

644
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:09,727
<i>Jun is closing in on her
and I can't locate Xue-Li.</i>

645
00:37:13,046 --> 00:37:15,983
Kensi, you hear me?
We're coming in the north gate.

646
00:37:16,284 --> 00:37:17,860
You need to find these guys.

647
00:37:27,219 --> 00:37:28,813
I've got eyes on Jun.

648
00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:40,412
Federal agent, Jun.
Don't move.

649
00:37:41,338 --> 00:37:43,302
- I got <i>Jun, Sam.</i>
- Eric, where's Xue-Li?

650
00:37:43,597 --> 00:37:45,012
I can't find her.

651
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:46,639
Ming says there are three.

652
00:37:55,461 --> 00:37:57,089
Go! Go! Go! Go!

653
00:38:05,138 --> 00:38:06,556
Don't do it, Xue-Li.

654
00:38:07,517 --> 00:38:08,702
We know about Calvin.

655
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,746
We found the clone.
It's over.

656
00:38:16,903 --> 00:38:18,556
There were several families,

657
00:38:19,411 --> 00:38:21,131
all agents of the MSS.

658
00:38:22,974 --> 00:38:25,786
We were told we'd be given
the gift of a second child

659
00:38:26,278 --> 00:38:28,118
if we would go to America

660
00:38:28,698 --> 00:38:30,069
and raise him to be a spy.

661
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:32,852
Did you resent the MSS?

662
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:36,947
Our son would be
the ultimate socialist hero.

663
00:38:38,294 --> 00:38:39,337
We were proud.

664
00:38:40,092 --> 00:38:41,651
When did you tell Calvin?

665
00:38:42,377 --> 00:38:43,779
A very young age.

666
00:38:44,812 --> 00:38:46,113
He always knew.

667
00:38:46,716 --> 00:38:49,435
We raised him to go to Annapolis,
join the Navy,

668
00:38:49,868 --> 00:38:51,708
but always loyal to China,

669
00:38:52,909 --> 00:38:54,784
And then what about Xue-Li?

670
00:38:56,073 --> 00:38:57,514
Sent from the MSS

671
00:38:57,556 --> 00:38:58,836
to be his handler,

672
00:38:59,688 --> 00:39:02,184
and make sure
we're still committed to the mission.

673
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,225
But in the end...

674
00:39:06,057 --> 00:39:07,768
he couldn't do it.

675
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:12,689
He was such a sweet boy.

676
00:39:13,655 --> 00:39:15,718
We never should have
made him do this.

677
00:39:16,549 --> 00:39:18,131
But Jun insisted

678
00:39:18,512 --> 00:39:20,441
it was why we came here.

679
00:39:25,548 --> 00:39:27,599
Ming, you got a chance
to do the right thing.

680
00:39:28,806 --> 00:39:30,451
Maybe even start over...

681
00:39:32,907 --> 00:39:35,556
if you tell us about the others
who might still be here.

682
00:39:38,814 --> 00:39:39,960
Think about it.

683
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:44,757
Calvin Lee was born
to be a sleeper agent.

684
00:39:45,271 --> 00:39:46,982
But deep down inside,

685
00:39:47,557 --> 00:39:48,719
he loved this country.

686
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:50,955
The store was the perfect cover.

687
00:39:51,576 --> 00:39:53,724
Agents could come and go,
no questions asked.

688
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,976
How many contacts
do we think they had?

689
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,330
Hard to say.

690
00:39:57,372 --> 00:39:59,609
Eric is going through their computers,
records,

691
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,625
security footage for months.

692
00:40:04,671 --> 00:40:05,521
Ready?

693
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:22,993
<i>Mom...</i>

694
00:40:25,325 --> 00:40:26,298
<i>Mom...</i>

695
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:27,903
<i>My baby!</i>

696
00:40:29,063 --> 00:40:31,102
I thought it would help Ming.

697
00:40:32,859 --> 00:40:35,766
She might tell us more
if she actually saw her daughter.

698
00:40:36,304 --> 00:40:38,602
Emotional witnesses
tend to open up more.

699
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,214
You may have just

700
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:43,950
blown open an entire cell
of sleeper agents,

701
00:40:43,992 --> 00:40:45,866
30 years in the making.

702
00:40:47,414 --> 00:40:49,738
You should stick
with what you do best.

703
00:40:52,524 --> 00:40:53,867
Carry on, everyone.

704
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:58,738
Nice work, buddy.

705
00:40:59,851 --> 00:41:00,624
Thanks.

706
00:41:00,929 --> 00:41:01,890
You know,

707
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:03,710
you're not a bad partner after all.

708
00:41:03,978 --> 00:41:04,856
Really?

709
00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:07,810
'Cause, well, I asked Hetty if,

710
00:41:08,067 --> 00:41:10,364
operational psychologists
had ever become agents.

711
00:41:12,817 --> 00:41:14,356
I'm sorry.
I so take it back.

712
00:41:14,398 --> 00:41:17,683
I know I'm logical,
but I'm also intuitive, self-sufficient.

713
00:41:21,914 --> 00:41:22,816
Cool.

714
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:25,923
I get it. Absolutely cool.

715
00:41:25,965 --> 00:41:27,552
