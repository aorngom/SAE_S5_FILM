1
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,700
Damn.

2
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,000
And severe thunderstorms
and localized downpours

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,400
Will rumble over areas
of northern california

4
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,800
And central nevada tonight and tomorrow.

5
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,000
Flood warnings for storey,
lyon and carson counties

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,900
Are in effect until 8:00 am
tomorrow morning.-That's great.

7
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,700
Off the big road, south of sin city.

8
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,800
Got a four wheeler, sitting duck.

9
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,900
Hey, if you guys are hungry,

10
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,900
I know a pretty good indian
restaurant that's open all night.

11
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,900
Oh, i can't. I have a date.

12
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,500
You got a date? With who?

13
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,500
My hot tub.

14
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,100
Now that sounds like a party.

15
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,000
You're so not invited.

16
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,800
Hold up, guys.

17
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,200
Change of plans.

18
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,300
I'm glad i caught you.

19
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,400
Is everything ok?

20
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,300
I've been on the phone
with a sheriff in nevada.

21
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,300
There's been a series
of suspicious accidents

22
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,900
In the reno area that may be connected.

23
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,600
Jj, this can't wait till morning?

24
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,700
I don't think so.

25
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,600
If i'm right about this,

26
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,400
I think we'll be leaving
first thing tomorrow.

27
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,700
Sorry.

28
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,100
Three nights ago outside of reno,

29
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,400
This car was hit by a tractor trailer.

30
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Any survivors?

31
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,600
The truck driver walked away unharmed.

32
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,000
Jonathan and rebecca gallen, the
passengers in the car, were doa.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,900
When the local sheriff
arrived on the scene,

34
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,400
He noticed several things

35
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
No blood spatter inside the car.

36
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,000
No seat belt burns.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,300
No lacerations from the air bags.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,500
They we dead before the accident.

39
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,100
The autopsy confirmed that
and the cause of death.

40
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,500
Blunt force head trauma

41
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,600
And evidence of rape
and torture to the woman.

42
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,500
The unsub wasn't very successful at hiding
the fact that he murdered two people.

43
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,600
There's a chance he has
gotten away with it before.

44
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,900
After i spoke to the sheriff,

45
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,800
I had garcia look into
any similar accidents

46
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,000
Near the california, nevada border.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,500
She found two with a similar m.O.

48
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,000
In the past couple of weeks.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,900
Both were couples, in a car,
hit by a tractor trailer.

50
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,800
It's always a man and a woman stopped
right in the middle of the road.

51
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,700
It's always at night
on a remote highway.

52
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,900
It can't be a coincidence
the victim type

53
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,500
And this very specific m.O.

54
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,200
Are the same in all three cases.

55
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,500
Was garcia able to find
any connection between them?

56
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,000
One thing they have in common
is that they all disappeared

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,800
For 48 hours prior to the accidents.

58
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,900
We know what he does to his
victims during that time.

59
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,500
We just need to figure
out where he finds them.

60
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,400
Wow. I can barely keep my eyes open.

61
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,500
You've been asleep since we left reno.

62
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,500
Really?

63
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,300
Oops.

64
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,400
Aah! Ian, look out!

65
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,900
Are you ok?

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,900
Yeah.

67
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,900
That was close.

68
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,000
Maybe we both need some rest.

69
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,000
Yeah.

70
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,300
You coming in?

71
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,700
No. I'm gonna call your mom
and check in with the kids.

72
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,100
You better lock the doors.

73
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,500
I'm not afraid of the dark.

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,200
Sure you're not.

75
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,200
Ha ha! Damn it, ian.

76
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,800
You scared me.

77
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,400
Me to get your second wind.

78
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,000
Oh, god.We've got this little
paradise all to ourselves.

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,200
What do you mean?

80
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,100
Look around. We're the only ones here.

81
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,200
Oh, it's such a beautiful night.

82
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,800
Ohh. Let's get to the cabin.

83
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,600
I'm so glad weook this trip.

84
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,500
Me too.

Jj?

91
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,800
It's so the baby can't hear.

92
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,100
What's he listening to?

93
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,400
Beethoven.

94
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,300
I personally preferred mozart, myself.

95
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,200
But be careful to limit his
exposure to one hour a day.

96
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,800
Amniotic fluids have a
tendency to amplify sound.

97
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,900
Thanks for the reminder, doc.

98
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,900
Ok, so, all three
crashes were on highways

99
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,700
Outside of carson city,
lake tahoe and reno.

100
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,400
All cities with a large and
diverse, transit population.

101
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,000
Not to mention the thousands of
locals mixing with seasonal workers.

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,200
An endless pool of
victims to chose from.

103
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,000
Rebecca gallen was beaten badly.

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,700
Ribs broken ante-Mortem.

105
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,500
He'd need time and privacy to do this.

106
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,400
That would suggest the killer
either lives or works in the area.

107
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,300
He's gng to such extremes
to try and hide the murders.

108
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,700
Maybe he has a
connection to the victims.

109
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,700
What does the press know?

110
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,900
All media outlets are
reporting an accident.

111
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,600
One thing going for us, the
killer has no idea we know.

112
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,700
That helps us.

113
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,600
Jj, when we land,would you explain
to sheriff bruner and his deputies

114
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,100
How important it is to keep this quiet?

115
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,700
Got it.

116
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,300
If the unsub finds out we're here,

117
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,200
All bets are off.

118
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
He could change him.O.

119
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,100
Or just pick up and find
his victims somewhere else.

120
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,800
Am i dreaming?

121
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,000
Time to get up.

122
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,000
No, it's a nightmare.

123
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,600
I want banana pancakes.

124
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,800
Please

125
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,500
Abby corbin, we don't have any kids,

126
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,700
Dogs or parents to deal
with for eight more hours.

127
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,800
Please let me sleep.

128
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,200
-No
-Why

129
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,200
Doesn't melted butter and
maple syrup sound so good?

130
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,200
I'll tell you what sounds
really good right now.

131
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
What?

132
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,000
Peace and quiet.

133
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,900
You're so not a morning person.

134
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,700
You knew that before we got married.

135
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,400
From this point on, the
company line is simple.

136
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,900
The fbi's here investigating
a missing persons.

137
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,000
You may be thinking, if
the public knew the truth,

138
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,700
They might be able to help us.

139
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,800
But we can't risk this getting out

140
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,200
Because this killer needs to believr
he's getting away with murder.

141
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,600
Any future calls related
to this investigation

142
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,900
Can be directed to me or agent jareau.

143
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,900
Remember, if we can just
keep a lid on this now

144
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,300
It'll only help us later. Thanks.

145
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,100
Thank you, agent jareau.

146
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,600
Yeah. Just doing my job

147
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,600
Ah, it's not much, but it's
a place to hang your hats.

148
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,600
All we need is a table
and an evidence board.

149
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,700
Sheriff, if you don't mind,

150
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,100
Some of us would like to go
to the site of the accident.

151
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,300
I'll have a deputy take you.

152
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,800
Rebecca gallen's father is
coming in to claim the bodies.

153
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,000
Why don't you let us take care of that?

154
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,100
I'd appreciate it.

155
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,600
I'll drive you myself.

156
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,500
Do you have any aerial
photos of the crash sites?

157
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,900
We didn't think to get any.

158
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,500
Not a problem.

159
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,000
I'll have our technical
analyst get some from the nsa.

160
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,400
I'd like to see what the areas
surrounding the highways are like.

161
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,600
First victims, fritz
and johanna dietrich,

162
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,700
Were found ten days ago,
visiting from germany.

163
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,300
Their accident site was on
highway 50 just south of tahoe.

164
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,000
Second couple, melissa and
tom taylor, were from oregon.

165
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,900
They were found on the
267, northeast of tahoe,

166
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,100
Not far from the interstate

167
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,100
It's right here.

168
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,400
And the latest victims,jonathan and
rebecca gallen, were from arizona.

169
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,000
Their accident occurred between
reno and carson city on highway 395.

170
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,700
Right here.

171
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,200
All three couples were staying
in the area without reservations.

172
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
Anthe only transactions
on their credit cards

173
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,600
Were from gas stations
hundred of miles away.

174
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,300
The common theme here is no paper trail.

175
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,300
If no one can contact
them or trace them,

176
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,800
They become the perfect victims.

177
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,300
Rebecca gallen's father
is going to be here soon.

178
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,100
I'll talk to him.

179
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,300
Maybe he can help us fill
in some of the blanks.

180
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,500
If you don't mind,
i'd like to go home now

181
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,600
And tell my wife that i
didn't kill that couple.

182
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,400
Sir, we're gonna have to
ask you not to do that.

183
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,200
But everyone believes i killed them.

184
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,700
You don't know what that feels like.

185
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,600
We understand what we're asking of you,

186
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,100
But this is an extremely important
part of our investigation.

187
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,100
We need the public to continue
to believe this was an accident.

188
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,400
Mr. Jones, we will catch this guy.

189
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
And when we do, your good
name will be vindicated.

190
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,700
I promise you that.

191
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,500
Well, ok.

192
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,600
If i can think of anything that would
be of use to you,i'll let you know.

193
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,600
Thanks for your time, sir.

194
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,000
This guy could've left
the bodies anywhere.

195
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,400
On the side of the road,
buried in the ground.

196
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,200
But he didn't. And
there's a reason for that.

197
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,600
Yeah. He's taunting us.

198
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,500
No, he's not.

199
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,600
This behavior tells us the
risk of leaving the bodies

200
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,300
Where he killed them
is greater than the risk

201
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,200
He takes staging these accidents.

202
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,400
Thank you.

203
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,900
Satellite photos.

204
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,300
Look at that. All three accident
sites have similar blind curves.

205
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,600
The grade of the hill about
the same, everlocation.

206
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,000
Now, what are these areas
just off the highway?

207
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,600
Some are fire roads, some are
trails for off-Ro vehicles.

208
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,000
Atvs and such.

209
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
We know this guy's organized.

210
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,800
Looks like he plans
his escapes in advance.

211
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,500
Mr. Sanders, i'm very sorry

212
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,100
That you have to be here
under these circumstances.

213
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,200
No father should have to
claim his daughter's dead body.

214
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,700
You're also here for your
son-In-Law jon, correc

215
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,400
Uh, i'm gonna i need a full
copy of that accident report.

216
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,300
We're suing that truck
driver and his employer.

217
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,800
Mr. Sanders, your daughter and son-In-Law
were hit by the tractor trailer,

218
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,800
But that's not how they died.

219
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,400
What are you talking about?

220
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,800
They were dead hours
before the collision.

221
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,100
No. The police told us
they died in the accident.

222
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,000
Yes, sir. I understand that.

223
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,900
We had to wait for the autopsy results.

224
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,200
And they confirmed that
they had been murdered.

225
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,300
Sir, i do understand how hard this is.

226
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,300
We believe rebecca and jon are the third
couple to die in these circumstances.

227
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,500
Who would want to kill my baby?

228
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,200
I have a couple of questions.

229
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,200
We found camping equipment
in the back of jon's car.

230
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,400
Yeah, yeah. He was real
big on the outdoors.

231
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,200
This time he had to
drag her along with him.

232
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,300
Do you know where he liked to camp?No.

233
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,300
Where he liked to hike?

234
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,800
I don't know.

235
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,100
Did he ever bring rebecca souvenirs?

236
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,600
T-Shirts from
anywhere? -I don't know.

237
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,200
How about restaurants?

238
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,500
Places he liked to eat

239
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,700
My baby has a...

240
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,300
Had a sweet toot

241
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,800
And, uh...

242
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,900
Jon would always bring
her back these donuts.

243
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,400
We found a matchbook
from a diner...flo's?

244
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,500
Does that ring a bell?

245
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,600
Maybe. I can't be sure.

246
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,900
It was a real popular place.

247
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,000
But...

248
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,700
He always brought some back for her.

249
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,800
Thank you.

250
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,700
Be right with you.

251
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,600
It's not even lunchtime yet.

252
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,100
The sign said people will travel
for miles for flo's donuts.

253
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,600
Sorry to keep you waiting.

254
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Would you like a dozen to share?

255
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,300
Ooh. Fbi.

256
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,700
Ma'am, we're trying to trace the steps of a
couple that may have been here a few days ago.

257
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,400
Darlin', i've waited on 87 folks
since we opened this morning.

258
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,800
Somebody would have to
come through here doing

259
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,100
Cartwheels on fire for me to remember.

260
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,100
Would you take a look anyway please?

261
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,000
Huh! Well, i'll be.

262
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,600
I do remember them

263
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,100
Were they doing cartwheels?

264
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,500
No, but i was.

265
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,500
The lady left me a
$10 tip for breakfast,

266
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,300
Two days in a row.

267
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,600
Nice couple.

268
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,800
They in some kind of trouble?

269
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,100
There's no cell service up here.

270
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,800
And that's a bad thing, why?

271
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
I do want to check in on the kids.

272
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,200
We'll be home by dinner.

273
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,800
Hey, i can't find my underwear.

274
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,800
Have you seen them?

275
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,200
You caught me.

276
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm serious.

277
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,000
I don't know.

278
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,100
I threw them in that
vicinity over there.

279
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,100
You know what? They didn't
just get up and walk away.

280
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,000
Hey.Here you go.

281
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,100
All right. Thank you.

282
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,200
Hey, it's breakfast.

283
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,700
Ok. This chair is bolted to the floor.

284
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,800
Someone really thinks we'd
want to steal this crap?

285
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,000
One man's trash...

286
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,400
Yeah, i know. I know.

287
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,700
Did you find your underwear?

288
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,600
No.

289
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,800
It's not funny

290
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,900
I'm not laughing.

291
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,200
But if i start looking
around and find it...

292
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,800
You owe me lunch.

293
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,500
I'll take that bet.

294
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,100
At least you finally got my breakfast.

295
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,900
I didn't order this.

296
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,200
Right.

297
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,000
I didn't.

298
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,600
Well, neither did i.

299
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,200
Ok. So who knew i
wanted banana pancakes?

300
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,800
It's time to go.

301
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,300
We have a witness who can put
the gallens at a diner in shwood.

302
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,500
So it's poible they
were staying close by.

303
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,800
I thought you forgot about me.

304
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,700
It hurt.

305
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,900
Garcia, what information do
you have on sherwood, nevada?

306
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,300
Uhh...sherwood.

307
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,100
A lovely town that is east of lake tahoe

308
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,000
Near the state line.

309
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,400
This area has close to 300
hotels, motels and resorts.

310
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,700
Garcia, can you send us a list
of-- Addresses and phone numbers?

311
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,300
On its way, kind sir.

312
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,700
Anything else i can do you for?

313
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,400
Not for now.

314
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,700
Thank you, garcia.

315
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,900
You, my fine furry friends, are welcome.

316
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,700
Remind me to have her drug tested.

317
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,700
So what's our plan?

318
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,000
I'll start narrowing down the list.

319
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,600
Then what?

320
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
We knock on every door

321
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,200
And show pictures of the gallens.

322
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,900
That could take days, weeks even.

323
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,000
I know we don't have the manpower,

324
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,900
But at this point,
what choice do we have?

325
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,200
Abby, let's go. Car'running.

326
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,300
Ok,ok

327
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,900
Did you get everything? Es.I got it.

328
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,600
You sure? -Yes. Um...

329
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,000
Ian, it's stuck.

330
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,500
You've got to just jiggle the handle.

331
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,200
I can't. All right. Well...

332
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,600
Wait a minute. Ian,
there's someone outside.

333
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,000
Hello!

334
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,400
Hey! Open it!

335
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,800
Hey! Open the door!

336
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,000
Hey!

337
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Ian

338
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
Morning, jj.

339
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,000
Sorry for the ke-Up call.

340
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,400
It's all right.Wasn't sleeping.

341
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,800
It looks like we've got a
possible missing persons.

342
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,800
Ian and by corbin were
in reno for the weekend.

343
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,100
They were supposed to be home yesterday.

344
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:20,800
Where's home?

345
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,100
San luis obispo.

346
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,500
They could've driven
right through sherwood.

347
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,100
They've already been missing a night.

348
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,300
His mom's looking after their two kids.

349
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,100
Call me when everybody gets here.

350
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,200
What is this?

351
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,100
Left-Over kung pao chicken?

352
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,500
That's disgusting.

353
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,500
What?

354
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,000
The smell of chinese
food makes you sick,

355
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,500
But you don't even flinch when
you look at those pictures.

356
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,900
She's pretty tough.

357
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,100
How much longer are
you going to do that?

358
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,600
We can't just sit here all night.

359
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Well, we haven't been sitting...ian.

360
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,100
And it's morning.

361
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,300
What?

362
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,500
Yeah.

363
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,900
Is that cement?

364
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,300
Calm down.

365
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,400
Damn it, abby, i'm trying
to get us out of here.

366
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,900
What was that?

367
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,600
Where did he go?

368
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,800
I don't see him.

369
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,200
Let me see it, please

370
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,000
Ian and abby corbin have already
been missing:for over 24 hours,

371
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,200
Which means we may only have
until tonight to find them.

372
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,700
According to their families,
they left reno yesterday

373
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,500
And were planning on stopping
somewhere for the night.

374
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,100
They didn't use a credit card.

375
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,000
Unless they avel with a lot of cash,

376
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,900
The room wasn't too expensive.

377
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,100
They were not traveling
on the interstate.

378
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,400
That eliminates over half
of our previous search.

379
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,800
Sounds like we're looking for somebody

380
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,400
Who works the night shift
at a back road motel.

381
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,500
And we think he's most likely
in his early to mid-Thirties.

382
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,300
Why is that?

383
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,300
Abducting couples is an ambitious task.

384
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,400
And this guy's had time
to perfect his skill.

385
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,600
He could be older.

386
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,000
Don't get hung up on his age.

387
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,500
That's the hardest thing to predict.

388
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,300
Wh we do know is females take
extensive beatings from him.

389
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,200
That, combined with the sexual assault,

390
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,000
Tells us he's a violent
anger excitation rapist.

391
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,800
A sexual sadist like this can't get off

392
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,100
Unless he's torturing and watching
the effects on his victims.

393
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,200
Part of the torture is psychological.

394
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,400
This is another reason he takes couples.

395
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,400
Chances are he forces one to
watch his power over the other.

396
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,800
Because only the women
suffer sexual torture,

397
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,200
He's likely a magnant misogynist.

398
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,500
Thisypically stems from an
extreme hatred towards a woman

399
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,300
Who was relentless in her
psychological and physical abuse.

400
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,500
How do you know the d
wasn't the abusive one

401
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,700
And he's just continuing the cycle?

402
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,900
Only a woman could make
him hate women this much.

403
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,600
The idea of the "terrible
mother" is best illustrated

404
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,500
In world mythology by the negative
aspects of the great mother.

405
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,500
Instead of nurturing her
children, she destroyed him.

406
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,600
And given this upbringing,

407
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,800
It's highly unlikely he'd
ever been in a relationship,

408
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,000
Let alone been married.

409
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,500
And since he works in
the service industry,

410
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,100
He's forced to deal wi a lot of people.

411
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,900
So he can probably hide
his aversion to women

412
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,800
Until he gets them behind closed doors.

413
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,900
With that said, we
shouldn't rule out anyone

414
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,700
With prior offenses tord women.

415
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,800
Given the amount of time
he spends with his victims,

416
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,600
He requires a great deal of privacy.

417
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,300
He may even utilize an atv to
get away from the accident sites,

418
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,100
So the property may back
up onto an off-Road trail.

419
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,300
We should therefore concentrate
on the most remote motels first.

420
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,200
Th

421
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,600
Oh, my god! Ian!

422
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,200
He was right there!

423
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,300
You just watched me do that.

424
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,800
You always second guess me.

425
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,100
Trust me. It's not going to break.

426
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,700
I'm always second-Guessing you?

427
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,500
Yeah.

428
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,400
When?

429
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,900
You want to get into this now?

430
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,100
We never should have stopped.

431
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,000
Oh, so it's my fault?

432
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,100
No. I didn't-- I
didn't say that.

433
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,500
But you want to. Go ahead.

434
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,600
Fine.

435
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,400
If you hadn't been hung over,

436
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,300
We could've been on
the road a lot earlier.

437
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,200
So it is my fault.

438
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,700
No, it's mine.

439
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,500
I should've cut you off.

440
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,100
Sorry for enjoying myself on vacation.

441
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,400
You should try it sometime.

442
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,600
I ve fun.

443
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,400
I just don't have to be drunk.

444
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,000
Once a year i have a
few too many at dinner.

445
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,800
Don't confuse me with your father.

446
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,000
Oh, my. Ohh.

447
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,500
Haven't seen them.

448
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,300
How many employees you got working here?

449
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,800
I've got 11 people on payroll.

450
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,100
You got a night manager?

451
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,300
We rotate the shift.

452
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,200
Got a nice set up in the back ofce.

453
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,500
All the movie channels.

454
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,500
Your employees, they have
access to all these rooms?

455
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,500
We all have master keys, yeah.

456
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,400
I need to see list
of all of those names.

457
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,200
Ok.

458
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,100
You get a lot of people staying over?

459
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,600
Some hard-Core riders.

460
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,300
Guys come up here for a night or two.

461
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,000
Ever get any couples?

462
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,600
You know any girls who'd stay here?

463
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,400
Yeah. I guess it is a bit...

464
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,600
Rustic.

465
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,500
Yeah.

466
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,200
They might get dirty.

467
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,900
So the rentals keep you busy.

468
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,300
Tourists, mainly.

469
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,100
Most locals have their own.

470
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,500
Imagine it's pretty easy to get
yourself turned around out there.

471
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,500
I guess.

472
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,500
But it's faster getting around
on trails than on the roads.

473
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,500
So, you run this place alone?

474
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,600
More work, more money.

475
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,500
Do you mind if i keep this?

476
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,900
Help yourself. Thanks for your me.

477
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,100
He's going to jam that
thing in your face again.

478
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,300
I need some air.

479
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,100
Do you want to get hurt?

480
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Here we go.

481
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,600
The silent treatment.

482
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,100
You know what? It's two
speeds with us lately, ian.

483
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,100
We either lash out or we shut down.

484
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,300
That's not true, ab.

485
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,100
Really? Then what do you call this?

486
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,900
Sorry about that.

487
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,400
I was around back.

488
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,100
Aaron hotchner, fbi

489
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,800
I'm wayne dryden. I'm the manager.

490
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,600
We're looking for these people.

491
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,800
Have you seen them?

492
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,800
Their names are abby and ian corbin.

493
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,700
They must have done something really bad

494
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,600
To bring the fbi all the way out here.

495
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,500
They're missing.

496
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,100
Is there anyone else here
who may have seen them?

497
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,600
Well, it's just me and the old lady.

498
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,300
And she's down at the
mall for this hummel expo.

499
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,200
She collects those things.

500
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,000
Do you know them? 'Ve heard of them.

501
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,800
She's got those things
taking over my office.

502
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,400
They are everywhere in there.

503
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,600
It's a sight.

504
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
Can i help you, sir?

505
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,300
Do you have any rooms?

506
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,400
One moment, sir.

507
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,700
If you see or hear
anything, here's my card.

508
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:07,900
Thank you.

509
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,800
I hope you find who you're looking for.

510
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,500
I'm sorry, sir. We have a full house.

511
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,200
But you
just said--

512
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,700
No, i didn't.

513
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,800
Well, you have any ideas
where we could stay?

514
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,900
Sure.

515
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,700
You can drive back down the road...

516
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,600
And  you turn left,

517
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,300
There's about 200 places.

518
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,800
And turn right, there's about 199.

519
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,800
'S already dark,

520
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,900
And we've barely gotten
through half of the motels.

521
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,800
Maybe he's not in the remote areas

522
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,400
You think he's hiding in
the middle of everything?

523
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,500
Maybe.

524
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,500
Let's go.

525
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,300
Wait. Guys?

526
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,800
Garcia found a connection between
a motel handyman and rebecca gallen.

527
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,400
Ey went to high school together.

528
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,000
So, i thought maybe he was
connected to other victims.

529
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,700
It turns out he's not,

530
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,700
But there's something else that
all of the women have in common.

531
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,700
Rebecca gallen was
found in a bra, t-Shirt,

532
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,300
Skirt and flip flops.

533
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,100
Johanna dietrich in a dress and sandals.

534
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,500
Melissa taylor was wearing
a bra, tank top, and jeans.

535
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,500
None of them were wearing underwear.

536
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,000
How do you know it was taken?

537
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,900
Because they all
packed it in their bags,

538
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,300
But none were wearing
it during theollisions.

539
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,200
He leaves his victims in a
car without their underwear

540
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,300
And waits for them to be hit.

541
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,500
A violent collision
of metal against flesh.

542
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,700
It's like the accidents
are the final rape.

543
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,900
This sexual aspect
didn't show up over night

544
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,800
This is something he's
been building up to.

545
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,800
What do you think your parents told them

546
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,300
When we didn't come home?

547
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,100
That we're on an adventure.

548
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,700
What's going to happen to them?

549
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,200
Ian. Abby.

550
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,300
Abby, abby, are you ok?

551
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,300
Yeah.

552
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,000
What's he doing?

553
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,200
Ian

554
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,100
What

555
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,100
Those aren't mine.

556
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,700
He was just in here.

557
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,700
Get behind me.

558
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,900
Ian, i'm scared.

559
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,000
So this guy sees these
collisions as some kind of rape.

560
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,200
We know that an underwear
fetish typically begins

561
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,800
In adolescence with peeping
in neighbors' windows.

562
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,100
When that no longer satisfies them,

563
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,800
They'll burglarize homes and start
taking the object thatarouses them.

564
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,300
If they get away ith that long enough,

565
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,800
They become more confident.

566
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,500
Then the object becomes
he woman wearing it.

567
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,900
That's when  rape can occur.

568
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,300
The one constant is they always
take the underwear as a souvenir.

569
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,900
Is it possible a pervert like
this has ever been arrested?

570
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,800
There's a good chance
a serial sex offender

571
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,900
With an underwear fetish
has been caught before.

572
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,300
Right again, agent hotchner.

573
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,400
What is it, garcia?

574
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,700
For the last two days i've
been searching throh vicap

575
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,300
For similar rapes and murders
in cases that are still open.

576
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,200
That has yielded me diddly squat.

577
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,600
So i regrouped.

578
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,200
I looked at some
pictures of baby pandas.

579
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,300
I went back i and i started searching for similar
rapes and murders in cases that had been solved. Ok?

580
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,400
What did you find?

581
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,700
Five months ago this
guy named clint barnes

582
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,600
Is convicted of 5 rapes that have
been 30 miles away in selbyville.

583
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,700
Now, what's interesting

584
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,800
And by interesting i also
mean icky and sad and wrong,

585
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Is that mr. Barnes only stole the
undergarment of his last victim

586
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,700
And she was beat in exactly the
same manner as our current victims.

587
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,200
And she was the only one who died.

588
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,200
The first four showed
no sign of torture?

589
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,100
According to statements
made by the survivors, yes

590
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,900
Some questions about his performance,

591
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,800
Thingsike, "did you enjoy it?"

592
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,100
That sounds like a
power reassurance rapist.

593
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,500
That doesn't fit his last crime aall.

594
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,600
The last victim wasn't his.

595
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,100
It was our unsub's.

596
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,300
Ian! Stop

597
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,700
Plse!

598
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,000
We need to clean your hand.

599
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,100
I'll be fine.

600
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,400
You're cut pretty bad.

601
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,700
I sa i'll be fine.

602
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,200
Ian, what are you doing? He got in here.

603
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,600
There's got to be a way out.

604
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,000
Just--Just slow
down for one second.

605
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,000
We gotta get out of
here! I know, ian--Uh!

606
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,000
Abby?

607
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,200
I'm so sorry.

608
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,400
Are you ok?

609
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,300
Abby

610
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,300
I didn't mean it.

611
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,700
I know.

612
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,600
I know you didn't mean it.

613
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,100
What's happening

614
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,100
Ian.

615
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,500
Just get us out of here.

616
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,300
Now.

617
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,200
Please.

618
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,900
The way out has to be in the bathroom.

619
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,000
Files rushed over
from the d.A.'S office.

620
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,900
How many suspects did the
have in the selbyville case?

621
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,200
Let's see. Including clint barnes,

622
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,100
Says they had about 10 other
men who looked good for it.

623
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,900
Brought in double that for questioning.

624
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,200
Jj, cross-Reference
these names of suspects.

625
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,700
See if you get a match with people
we still need to talk to in sherwood.

626
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,800
You got it. -You can us my office.

627
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,900
Almost all these guys
had criminal records.

628
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,900
Offenses range from
spousalabuse, sex crimes,

629
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,400
Molestation and attempted rape.

630
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,100
Our unsub is using brutal,
physical force and extreme violence.

631
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,500
Look for somebody who's angry
and hostile towards his victims.

632
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,100
Look for an intellectual component.

633
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,100
This guy used the m.O. Of another rapist

634
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,500
To make sure the wrong person
went to jail for his crimes.

635
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,600
The selbyville police
talked to our unsub.

636
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,100
He looked good for these crimes.

637
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,900
He's in here somewhere.

638
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,300
You need to let us go.

639
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,000
Now!

640
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,800
People are waiting for us.

641
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,400
If we're not home,

642
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,500
They're going to call the police.

643
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,200
They have no idea you're here.

644
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,200
We told them we're staying in sherwood.

645
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,800
That's not what ian said
when he checked you in.

646
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,200
What do you want?

647
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,600
I want to know...

648
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,600
Why you are with a man who
doesn't take care of you.

649
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:49,600
And en you let him
push yoaround like that.

650
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:04,500
Have you ever wondered what
it's like to be with a real man?

651
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,300
All right, garcia, let's try again.

652
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,400
Go for it.

653
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,100
Name's floyd henson.

654
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,900
Lived and worked in
sherwood his entire life.

655
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,300
Went to jail at 25 for
breaking and entering.

656
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,600
Our friend got caught
red-Handed with some bloomers

657
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,800
Charged with attempted rape.

658
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,700
Jerk served time, got out a year ago.

659
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,700
His last known address
is at the crest cottages.

660
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,400
Jj, the list of hotels
and motels we went to.

661
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,600
I interviewed the manager there.

662
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,000
His name was dryden, right?

663
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,300
Employee records say wayne dryden was fired
from the crest cottages six months ago.

664
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,700
The only employee now is the owner...

665
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,900
Floyd hansen.

666
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,500
Abby?

667
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,300
Let's go. I know where we're going.

668
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,500
Jj, tell garcia we'll
call her from the car.

669
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,100
Abby.

670
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,700
Wake up.

671
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,300
Honey, what'd he do toou?

672
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,300
I'm going to kill that son of a bitch.

673
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,700
He said he'll be back.

674
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,800
Abby,

675
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,000
I love you.

676
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,100
I'm going to get us out of here.

677
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,200
Do you hear me?

678
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,400
Abby

679
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,900
I should've taken my own
advice and gotten some rest.

680
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,400
Hotch, we've talked to so many people.

681
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,900
It could've been any of us.

682
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,600
Hello?

683
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,200
Hello?

684
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Do you hear me, garcia?

685
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,800
Yeah, that's better.
I can sort of hear you.

686
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,700
So, like i was saying,

687
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,500
It looks like floyd hansen
didn't even have a chance.

688
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,900
His mother drank herself
to death when he was two.

689
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,000
Father remarried but to a prostitute.

690
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,300
Where's his father now?

691
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,800
He died six months ago.

692
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,800
Floyd inherited the
crest cottages from--

693
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,100
Garcia?

694
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,400
We lost her.

695
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,000
Hello? Reid? Oh, man.

696
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,900
Timeline fits. He gets
out of jail a year ago,

697
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,400
He's on good behavior for a few months.

698
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,600
But the urges are too strong,

699
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,700
Rapes and kills a woman,

700
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,600
But he's smart enough to
blame it on another guy.

701
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,300
His father dies, he
inherits all the privacy,

702
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,400
Control and victims he could ever need.

703
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,500
It's loose.

704
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,700
I got one. Look, ab.

705
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,400
If i get one more...

706
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,200
No. Don't you do that.

707
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,900
Don't you give up on me.

708
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,200
Abby, look at me.

709
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,100
You can do this.

710
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,900
We're going to do this.

711
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,500
We're going to get out of here, abby.

712
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,300
That would really be something

713
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,700
'Cause that hasn't happened yet.

714
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,200
But this...

715
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,800
This always happens.

716
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,700
Uh! Oh. Easy.

717
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,100
Someone always gives up.

718
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,700
I got to say, i didn't
think it was going to be you.

719
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,500
I mean, i get it.

720
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,400
You're tired.

721
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,800
Leave her alone!

722
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,700
You know, i heard you're
not a morning person,

723
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,300
But what kind of man turns that down?

724
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,100
You didn't touch my pancakes

725
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,600
So you must be starving.

726
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,600
And then there's him.

727
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,500
He's supposed to protect you.

728
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,200
Isn't that the deal?

729
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:43,500
Isn't that why you
married a big, strong man?

730
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,100
So...

731
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,400
Why did he just sit
there the whole time?

732
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,100
You son of a bitch.

733
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,600
There are 10 cabins on 10 acres.

734
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,100
There are maps outside the office.

735
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,000
He's got a lot of privacy.

736
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,900
There's a garage, there's
the sheds, there's stables...

737
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,200
Why not keep them in one of the cabins?

738
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,500
We're going to have to check everything.

739
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,500
We'll look in here.

740
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,000
Ok. Morgan, prentiss this way.

741
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,700
He's been following the investigation.

742
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,100
He's been at this longer han we thought.

743
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,000
Don't worry.

744
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,200
When i'm done with her,

745
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,400
It'll take the fight ight out of you.

746
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,800
Morgan, prentiss, i'm at cabin 6.

747
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,800
No!

748
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,500
Fbi

749
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,400
Ian!

750
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,300
He went through there.

751
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,000
Morgan! Ian!

752
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,600
There.

753
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,700
Are you ok?

754
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,600
Ian.

755
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,300
We need an ambulance cabin 6.

756
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,500
Is he ok?

757
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,800
Is he ok?

758
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,100
He's going to be ok.

759
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,200
Ian

760
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,900
Well, roadside motels
definitely go on my list.

761
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,300
Of things to never do again.

762
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,300
You've got a list?

763
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,500
You don't?

764
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,100
It's going to take a while
to get this mess cleaned up.

765
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,100
Well, it's going to take a hell of a
lot longer for that couple to recover.

766
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,200
I wonder if this place was ever nice.

767
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,000
I was here.

768
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,400
I talked to him and i didn't see it.

769
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,200
He made himself look like a good guy.

770
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,700
You bought it.

771
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,900
It happens.

772
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,600
To the best of us.

773
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,000
Welcome to the club.

774
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,500
Roman poet phaedrus wrote,

775
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,400
"Things are not always what they seem.

776
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,700
The first appearance deceives many.

777
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:18,400
The intelligence of a few perceives
what has been carefully hidden."
