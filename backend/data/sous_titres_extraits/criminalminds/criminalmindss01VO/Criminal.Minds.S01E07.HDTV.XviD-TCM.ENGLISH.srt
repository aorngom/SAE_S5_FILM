1
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,600
No. No! No, mommy, don't let him get me.

2
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,200
Sam! He ruined my picture, mom.

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,900
It's Ok, honey. We'll make another one.

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,800
Chris, I've asked you not to get him worked up before bed.

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,100
We're just playing.

6
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,900
We have got a 12-hour car ride tomorrow.

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,400
Now he's gonna be up half the night.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,200
Ok, Ok. Kids, go get Ben.

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,900
But my picture!

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,800
You can work on it tomorrow in the car, honey

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,000
on the way to disney world.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,900
Yeah!

13
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,600
- Ok.
- Disney world!

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You do realize I am the only adult in this house?

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,700
Well, isn't that what you love about me?

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,500
Every once in a while

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,500
I would like a tiny bit of help, Mr. Crawford.

18
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,200
You got it, Mrs. Crawford.

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,000
Thank you.

20
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,000
Ben!

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,400
Ben, where are you?

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,100
Where are you, Ben?

23
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:13,200
Benny! Where are you? Ben!

24
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,000
He's not coming, dad.

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,800
Good boy, Ben.

26
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,500
Hey, Sam.

27
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,200
Just let him sleep with us.

28
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,800
Dad?

29
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,900
Yeah?

30
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,600
I love you.

31
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,900
I love you, too, kiddo.

32
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,100
The is WDCW 88.8. Good morning folks.

33
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,300
It's time to get out, get out there and enjoy it.

34
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,000
The forecast for you is mostly sunny with brisk easterly winds.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,700
You can expect a high near 75 degrees.

36
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,700
Clear tonight with a low near 61.

37
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,600
Chris.

38
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
Sam?

39
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,100
Dr. Thomas Fuller wrote

40
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,900
"with foxes, we must play the fox."

41
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,400
Crawford family. Butchered in their homes.

42
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,900
Murder/suicides?

43
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,100
That's what we have to find out.

44
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,600
He's so gorgeous.

45
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,700
Thank you.

46
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,400
If you find baldness and wrinkles attractive.

47
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,900
Look at his little witty bitty nose.

48
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,500
Don't you want one of these?

49
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,600
Mm. I'll stick to practicing.

50
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,700
Congratulations.

51
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,100
Thanks. She's amazing.

52
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,500
I'm a little terrified.

53
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,900
Well, uh, we should get going.

54
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,600
Pleasure seeing you, Mrs. Hotchner.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,800
Bye-bye.

56
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,400
Bad?

57
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,600
The worst.

58
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,800
Crawford family. Murdered 3 days ago.

59
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,300
Saw it on the news.

60
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,200
They were found in the basement of their house.

61
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,400
Bags packed for a vacation they never took.

62
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,900
Report said it was a murder/suicide.

63
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,700
Father stabbed the mom, then shot himself.

64
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,300
That's the conclusion Maryland State police came to.

65
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,600
The gun was found next to the father.

66
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,300
Had gunpowder residue on his right hand.

67
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,800
And now you must have some compelling reason

68
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,700
to think that Chris Crawford didn't off his family?

69
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,400
Yeah. Another murdered family.

70
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
The Millers--found a month ago.

71
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,400
The mother Reese Miller, her 2 children, and her new husband.

72
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,500
Again, they were found in the basement

73
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,600
and like the Crawfords, their suitcases were packed for a vacation.

74
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,300
Both cases, the bodies were discovered

75
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,900
5 days after their vacations were supposed to have started.

76
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,900
Yet the coroner determined that they had been dead only 24 hours.

77
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,000
So for 4 days, both families remained in the house.

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,700
Location of the bodies, both cases, the basement.

79
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,500
That indicates a level of organization.

80
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,700
With a quick, but disorganized application of overpowering force.

81
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,900
If these aren't murder/suicides

82
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,800
someone's doing a damn good job of making them look like it.

83
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,000
Possibly this man--Eric Miller.

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,100
Biological father of the Miller children.

85
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,500
Arlington P.D. Issued a bolo for Miller after the bodies were discovered.

86
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,700
Ex-wife Reese Miller had a restraining order

87
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,600
against him for domestic violence.

88
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
When she get re-married?

89
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,900
The week before they were killed.

90
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,500
Violent husbands believe their wives and children are property.

91
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,700
Reese Miller getting re-married possibly made him snap.

92
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,400
Well, the Virginia cops finally located Eric Miller last night

93
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,000
responding to a drunken disturbance at
a motel where Miller had been hiding out.

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,900
When they found him

95
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,900
they discovered blood on his black leather jacket.

96
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,100
Belonged to his children.

97
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,500
Was any of his DNA found at the Crawford house?

98
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,100
No.

99
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,400
Did he know the Crawfords?

100
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,000
If he does, he's not saying.

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,600
In fact, he hasn't said a word since his arrest.

102
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,200
Uh, the Arlington P.D. have asked us to interview him.

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,200
If anyone could apply overwhelming force, he's your man.

104
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,100
I want you to find out. Talk to him.

105
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,100
You want me to talk to him?

106
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,100
Yeah. You've done interviews before with other agents running point.

107
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,300
You can go solo.

108
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,900
Morgan, the Crawford house is a fresh crime scene.

109
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,200
Once the Crawfords were brought down to this basement

110
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,000
they must have known their fate.

111
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,200
M.E. Said they were all killed down here.

112
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,300
Sam was found here. Emily over there.

113
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,300
So...I'm the unsub. How did I do it?

114
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,100
Well, I had to bring 'em down here first.

115
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,700
How?

116
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,400
I had a gun.

117
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,200
Ok. Use a gun to force them down here. What next?

118
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,500
- Stab 'em.
- Who first?

119
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,200
The strongest, the father.

120
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,200
He was found right there, and then the mother.

121
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,600
That's her right there.

122
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,300
How you gonna keep the kids from running away?

123
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,200
Restraints.

124
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,000
Can't aim a gun at them and
stab the mother at the same time.

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,800
No restraints were found on the victims.

126
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,700
Because I took them with me.

127
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,400
No ligature marks were found.

128
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,500
Let's go upstairs. See how they lived.

129
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,100
Sam Crawford. White male.

130
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,500
Age 5. Multiple stab wounds.

131
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,500
Laceration to the left ventricle.

132
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,900
No defensive wounds present.

133
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,100
Allison Crawford. White female. 32.

134
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:29,700
Multiple stab wounds. C.O.D.--Exsanguination.

135
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,800
Emily Crawford. White female. 8.

136
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,500
Multiple stab wounds. C.O.D.--Exsanguination.

137
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,300
Christopher Crawford. White male. 36.

138
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,300
Point-blank single 9 millimeter
gunshot wound to the temporal lobe.

139
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,500
Where's his wedding ring?

140
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,300
It's not listed in his personal effects.

141
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,500
He obviously wore one, so where is it?

142
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,900
I'm Dr. Spencer Reid from the FBI.

143
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,000
I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.

144
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,600
Got something you wanna ask me, boy?

145
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,200
You look me in the eye, and you ask.

146
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,300
3 days ago--

147
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,800
you're not looking at me.

148
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,100
3 days ago, the Crawford family was murdered.

149
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,400
Is that right?

150
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
Did you know them?

151
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,600
What are you getting at?

152
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,700
They were killed in the exact same way

153
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,400
that your family was killed.

154
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
And?

155
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,700
I've been slapped around all night by every cop in Virginia.

156
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,600
What makes you think a damn photo is gonna scare me?

157
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,600
Is that what this is about, hmm?

158
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,100
You think I'm crazy, man?

159
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,600
You think I suddenly snapped

160
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,100
and I slaughtered my own wife and kids?

161
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,700
You think I did this? Huh?

162
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,700
Is that what you think?

163
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,200
Sit down, now.

164
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,600
Is this your daddy?!

165
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,900
I'm done talking to you people!

166
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,100
You don't have to talk. Just listen.

167
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,800
On the occasions you assaulted your wife, you were intoxicated.

168
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,200
Once the effects of alcohol wore off

169
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,200
you were overcome by feelings of remorse.

170
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,700
I'm gonna tell you this just one time. You shut your mouth!

171
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,800
Genetic factors contribute to alcohol stress interactions.

172
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,600
Your mother was an alcoholic

173
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,800
and she was often too drunk to stop the beatings

174
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,000
that your father gave you.

175
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,800
I think we should stop this.

176
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,900
He's not finished.

177
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,500
Age 6, you were orphaned to a family where the abuse continued

178
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,800
only this time, it was sexual.

179
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,400
You shut your mouth, or I'm gonna rip your face off.

180
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,700
The abuse continued well into puberty

181
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,400
but my one concern is, Eric

182
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,500
did you or did you not continue
the cycle with your own children?

183
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,000
I never laid a hand on my children.

184
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,800
You hear me?!

185
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,400
I hear you.

186
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,600
I found them like that.

187
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,300
Dead. Bloodied. My babies.

188
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,400
My sweet, little babies.

189
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,100
I was crazy out of my mind. I didn't know what to do.

190
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,500
And I knew the cops were gonna blame me, and they have.

191
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,400
So you ran?

192
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,700
So what've I got now?

193
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,500
You have your innocence.

194
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,400
For the sake of your children

195
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,900
I believe that they, at the very least, deserve the truth.

196
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,500
I can't get...the image of my dead children out of my mind.

197
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,100
Ty, my little boy

198
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,700
he was clutching a...a piece of paper.

199
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,500
I think it was a drawing.

200
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,400
May--maybe a painting.

201
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,500
Please. I'd love to know what he painted, Dr. Reid.

202
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,600
Interesting interrogation technique.

203
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,800
What did you hope to accomplish?

204
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,700
Well, he was closed off, defensive, hostile.

205
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,100
I needed a way in.

206
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,900
He's suffered a breakdown

207
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,200
but I don't think he killed his family

208
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,500
and I know he still loved his wife.

209
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,600
Why do you say that?

210
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,300
Even though they were divorced

211
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,700
he's still wore the wedding ring.

212
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,000
The yard is overgrown.

213
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,900
Like the roof, Chris Crawford's car is in need of maintenance

214
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,900
and Allison Crawford's S.U.V. is in pristine condition.

215
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,000
Says here that Allison drove the kids to school.

216
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,800
If they were educated privately

217
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,200
maybe the car was just an attempt to show the other parents wealth.

218
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,800
Like this house.

219
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,500
Designer magazines conspicuously placed

220
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,900
expensive modern furniture, plasma TV.

221
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,900
Behind the curtains, water damage.

222
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,500
Allison spent money on the things her friends could see

223
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,300
and neglected those they couldn't.

224
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,700
The Crawfords lived beyond their means.

225
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,900
So, where'd the extra cash come from?

226
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,800
Get Garcia to check their financial status.

227
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
"Emily."

228
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,700
This painting is of this house.

229
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,200
Strange for a child. It has no color.

230
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,900
Has lines, dimensions, but no color.

231
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,100
No dog collar was found, right?

232
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,400
Maybe the dog didn't have one.

233
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,200
Mm-hmm. He'd have to have one.

234
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,900
Come here.

235
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,600
See that?

236
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,700
This dog door opens automatically

237
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,300
via a chip in the dog's collar.

238
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,100
If anything attempted to get in without one...

239
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,400
The alarm would've been activated.

240
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,500
When the cops got here, the house was locked tight

241
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,700
and the alarm was hot.

242
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,200
So the night the Crawfords were murdered

243
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,300
the only way in or out was with the dog collar.

244
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,600
Gideon, whoever killed this family had to be a big guy.

245
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,200
Chris Crawford was a black belt in judo.

246
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,700
So are you.

247
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,400
I've got a gun to your back.

248
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,700
Maybe you could take it from me.

249
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,000
But your children are in the same room.

250
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,900
And if you fail, they die.

251
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,700
Does it matter how big I am now?

252
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,500
Bound or not, Allison Crawford would've put up one helluva fight.

253
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,100
Emily and Sam would've been sobbing.

254
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,000
Crawford didn't kill his family.

255
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,700
And there's no evidence Miller was ever in the house

256
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,400
or he'd have known.

257
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,600
Help me! Help! Please! Help me!

258
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:16,100
No! No! Please! Please, no! No!

259
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,300
What are you doing?

260
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,300
Why didn't anyone hear them scream?

261
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,600
I believe the unsub had control of this family.

262
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,500
He may have separated each family member.

263
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,500
Tells the mother, "if you scream, I'll kill your children."

264
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,900
Tells the children, "if you cry, I'll kill mommy."

265
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,200
The suspect found a way of restraining them without leaving marks.

266
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,100
Based on lividity...

267
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,300
the M.E. Estimates that the father was the last to die.

268
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,600
Which means he witnessed the whole thing.

269
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,200
If he did spend time with both families

270
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,100
he must've known he had the time to spend with 'em.

271
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,000
'Cause he knew they were goin' on vacation.

272
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,300
Look at travel agents, relatives, work colleagues

273
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,800
contract workers, children's tutors.

274
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,100
Gideon, we've been looking into the Crawford financials.

275
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,800
Allison Crawford spent way more money than Chris could afford.

276
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,700
They were in major debt.

277
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,300
And Chris Crawford wrote a number of checks

278
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,500
for a series of visits to a therapist.

279
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,400
She had 2 cell phone accounts...

280
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,400
one of them billed to a separate address in southeast Washington, D.C.

281
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,800
You get that?

282
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,900
Federal agents! FBI! Federal agents! Clear!

283
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,600
That's the cleanest thing in here.

284
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,800
What's that?

285
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,700
It's a child's painting. It's a colonial house.

286
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,600
Mom, dad, 2 children out front holdin' hands.

287
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,700
And a big dog.

288
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,600
I think it's the Crawford house. It's signed by Emily.

289
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,300
Strange. Eric Miller said he found his son clutching a painting.

290
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,900
He wanted to know what was on it.

291
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,000
What was on it?

292
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,400
His son's blood.

293
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,500
Hotch! Hotch!

294
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,000
Hey. Whoa. Whoa. Easy.

295
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,300
Freeze!

296
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,300
Why am I here?

297
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,500
I think you know why.

298
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,300
That's mine.

299
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,700
Colors indicate a self-confidence...an outgoing personality.

300
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,800
Shows an above-average intelligence.

301
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,200
The child that painted this was left-handed.

302
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,900
Emily Crawford was left-handed.

303
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,700
Right.

304
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,000
You're not.

305
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,600
How'd you get the painting, Frank?

306
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,500
Forget to take your medicine today, Frank?

307
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,100
For a severe manic-depressive, that's not good.

308
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,500
They make me feel wrong.

309
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,200
Wrong enough to kill the Crawfords?

310
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,300
Frank.

311
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,800
I--I did a--a bad thing.

312
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,600
What did you do?

313
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,800
I shouldn't have gone to the house.

314
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,900
Allison told me not to.

315
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,900
I would never...never hurt Ally.

316
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,700
She's the only family I got.

317
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,000
Family?

318
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,900
She's my sister.

319
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:02,800
She's dead.

320
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,700
He killed them.

321
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,600
Chris did. I know he did it.

322
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,900
What bad thing did you do?

323
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:19,100
The rule was...I was never supposed to go to the house.

324
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,400
That was the only rule.

325
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,900
Allison said if Chris saw me...

326
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,000
he would never let me see her again.

327
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,600
He was gonna lock me up in the loony bin.

328
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,100
He never liked me.

329
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,400
You went...to the house.

330
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,800
She said...she couldn't visit me anymore.

331
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,900
I just wanted to see her.

332
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:46,000
Seeing Allison made everything better

333
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,600
but they cut my phone off.

334
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,000
That day! The day I went to see them!

335
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,100
They cut my phone off! 

336
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,500
I never would've gone to the house

337
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,600
if they hadn't cut off the phone!

338
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,400
There's no way this guy could've
gotten into the house without a key.

339
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,000
Right.

340
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,100
Knowing how Chris Crawford felt about his brother-in-law

341
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,200
you see him having one?

342
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,500
No.

343
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,800
Frank, you went to the house. What did you do?

344
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:10,600
It was...dark. And--and cold.

345
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:15,000
I went around to the side to look through the window.

346
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,900
But my breath steamed up the glass

347
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,700
and I wiped it clean, and...and I--

348
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,300
I could see them, sitting down for dinner.

349
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:33,500
I saw Emily and Sam, and...Sam was crying.

350
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,100
I guess he was in trouble.

351
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,000
Did you see Allison?

352
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Yeah.

353
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,300
She was saying grace over the table.

354
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:48,100
And then...she looked up and saw me.

355
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,200
And she mouthed something at me.

356
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,100
I think it was, "get the hell out."

357
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,300
So I left.

358
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,800
Did Chris see you?

359
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,800
No. He wasn't there.

360
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,000
But a friend was at the head of the table.

361
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,900
You said a friend?

362
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,600
Mm-hmm. I saw someone.

363
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,800
What did this person look like?

364
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,400
I--I didn't see their face...but...uh...tiny.

365
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
Really tiny.

366
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,600
White or black, Frank?

367
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,800
I don't know. But...

368
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,500
What?

369
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,800
The hair. It--it...it was red.

370
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,800
If Frank saw them that day

371
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,000
it wasn't Chris Crawford at the table.

372
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,300
Maybe it was the suspect.

373
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,700
And she wasn't saying, "go away."

374
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,500
She was saying, "help me."

375
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,200
It--it wasn't a friend.

376
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,000
Frank.

377
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,400
It wasn't a friend at all.

378
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,400
It was him.

379
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,800
He's the one who killed them.

380
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,700
Frank.

381
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,800
I--I--I--I--

382
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,200
Frank.

383
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,300
No! No! No! No!

384
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,800
Frank. Frank. Frank, Frank, stop.

385
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:01,000
No! Frank! Frank! No! Let go! Stop it! No! No!

386
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,800
Frank, calm down!

387
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,700
Frank! Come on!

388
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,300
Both families had a dog.

389
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,000
And both houses had a dog door.

390
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,500
Fielding said that the person he saw was small.

391
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,800
Yeah, well, in order to get through that door

392
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,200
you'd have to be 5'4", tops, and real thin.

393
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,300
"When you have eliminated the impossible

394
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,300
whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."

395
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,400
Sherlock Holmes was a fictional character.

396
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,700
Whoever did this isn't.

397
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,700
We can be pretty sure he's probably
found himself another family by now.

398
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,300
Let's just watch him sleep.

399
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,700
No. We've got a long day ahead of us tomorrow.

400
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,200
Can I kiss him?

401
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,000
Both of you, out.

402
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,500
Ok. No, I understand. Yeah. I figured as much. Thank you.

403
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,100
He's been looking at those pictures all morning.

404
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,500
Well, I sure hope he sees a connection

405
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,400
'cause I've checked doctors, lawyers, travel agents, tutors

406
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,200
contract workers. I got nothin'.

407
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,900
Why target those families?

408
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,800
Well, to know that, we have to know how.

409
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,300
We know organized killers are often skilled workers

410
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,300
with above-average intelligence.

411
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,800
High birth status.

412
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,800
And in most cases...male.

413
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,000
In the workplace, he's socially confident.

414
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,500
And with women...sexually confident.

415
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Every offense...is preplanned.

416
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,700
Targeting the victim is almost as pleasurable as the actual kill.

417
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,100
These guys, they're...they're meticulous.

418
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,300
It's a compulsion.

419
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,000
Everything has to have its proper place.

420
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,100
They do exhaustive amounts of research on their victims.

421
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,700
They watch their every move

422
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,700
every last detail is observed.

423
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,600
Everything has to be written ever so neatly

424
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,400
in a book or possibly a journal.

425
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,800
When the kids are comin' home from school.

426
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,200
When daddy'll be home.

427
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,700
Playtime. Suppertime. Bath time. Bedtime.

428
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,400
Plan the work...work the plan.

429
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
This is the way that he maintains control.

430
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,800
It's also how he personalizes his target...

431
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,300
so nothing's left to chance.

432
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,300
Absolutely nothing...

433
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,300
is left out of place, ever.

434
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,900
So he plans the work...

435
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,300
and when he's good and ready, he works that plan.

436
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
He takes great pride in his job.

437
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,800
I think the workplace has to be the connection.

438
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,800
Both are by Emily, painted months apart.

439
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,800
This one...is full of color, life.

440
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,900
The one I found at Emily's house has lines, dimensions. No color.

441
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,900
I believe Emily was coerced to make this.

442
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,600
It's a point of view. It is his point of view.

443
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,000
This is where the killer stood, just watched the family.

444
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,800
Each of the dead husbands was missing his wedding ring.

445
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,900
This is the unsub's trophy.

446
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,400
He targets a family because he lost his own.

447
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
For a few days, he gets to play daddy.

448
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,800
And he can do whatever he wants
because no one's gonna come lookin'

449
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,200
because they're supposed to be on vacation.

450
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,200
Let's get forensics to check the inside of Chris Crawford's clothing.

451
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,600
The suspect may have worn the father's clothes to...

452
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
whew! Complete the fantasy.

453
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,700
So, why kill them?

454
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,300
'Cause the fantasy can't last.

455
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:36,200
Do we know anything that actually helps us identify this bastard?

456
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,800
Wait a minute.

457
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,800
Chris Crawford worked for the I.R.S.

458
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:45,400
And...Reese Miller was a secretary at the GAO.

459
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,100
That makes them both government employees.

460
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,300
Let's check out Chris Crawford and Reese Miller.

461
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,100
He had his share of problems at home.

462
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,600
Who doesn't?

463
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,700
But he didn't fix 'em by killin' his family.

464
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,300
Were you aware he was in therapy?

465
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,800
He mentioned a marriage counselor.

466
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,800
He say who?

467
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,600
Nope. And I didn't ask.

468
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,900
I don't like to pry.

469
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,100
That's surprising, comin' from an I.R.S. Agent.

470
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,900
You mind if we go through Chris's belongings?

471
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,600
See if he had any connection to Miller?

472
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,900
You're welcome to look through anything you like.

473
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,900
Family therapists.

474
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,300
They often use children's paintings to assess the family unit.

475
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,300
We're all still in shock.

476
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,400
Reese was a quiet woman.

477
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,700
She kept pretty much to herself, bell to bell.

478
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,600
Brought in her own lunch, and she had 2 kids

479
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,100
but then you knew that.

480
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,300
It's just so terrible. I still can't believe it.

481
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,800
She was covering for one of my women who was on maternity leave.

482
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,900
And she was always tired, you know?

483
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,300
But then any woman married to Eric Miller would be.

484
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,500
He was a mean drunk.

485
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,000
Mrs. Raleigh...

486
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,100
He hit her, you know?

487
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,900
She tried to cover it up

488
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,700
but concealer can only do so much magic.

489
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,500
I should know.

490
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,400
Mrs. Raleigh.

491
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,500
I'm tired. I'm talking too much.

492
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,100
Do you know if Mrs. Miller was seeing a marriage counselor?

493
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,100
Reese kept pretty much to herself.

494
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,000
You're not betraying any confidence.

495
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,100
We need to know everything about her life.

496
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,800
Every thursday, I covered for her

497
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,100
so she could take off early to see a therapist.

498
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,200
Thought it worked.

499
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,500
She kicked the bastard out, got remarried.

500
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,000
Look what that got her.

501
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,600
We gotta stop meeting like this, Reid. People will talk.

502
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,800
But then talk is cheap.

503
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,700
Not when you're talkin' to a therapist.

504
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,200
The Crawfords made 12 weekly payments

505
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,000
to the applewood family medical center.

506
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,700
What about the Millers?

507
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,500
No. Nothin' here.

508
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,200
How about pharmaceuticals?

509
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,200
Nobody gets therapy these days
without a healthy dose of medication.

510
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,400
What are you implying, Reid?

511
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,300
That everyone is medicated.

512
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,500
Did you just make a joke?

513
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,800
No. I meant statistics.

514
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,000
- They--they show that--
- Reid, next time, just say yes.

515
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,200
Now, medication normally requires reimbursement from the HMO

516
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,300
and since she works for the government like you and I

517
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,600
we share the same health care provider.

518
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,800
Are you hacking into the government's HMO database?

519
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,700
Is that legal?

520
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,900
'Course not. We'll go to prison, and you'll be someone's bitch.

521
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:11,800
Really?

522
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,400
Oh. Right there. Good call, Reid.

523
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Mrs. Reese Miller--diazepam.

524
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,800
Who prescribed the meds?

525
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,200
Dr. R. Howard at the applewood family center.

526
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,100
Let's find out what he looks like. Here we go.

527
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,100
Dr. Howard isn't a he.

528
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,700
Excellent, Lacey. Really wonderful.

529
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,000
There's so much color. It's very lovely, indeed.

530
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,800
Dr. Rachel Howard?

531
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200
I'm special agent Aaron Hotchner with the FBI.

532
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,500
Come on, Lacey. Come on, go with mommy.

533
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,000
Can I help you?

534
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,800
I'm agent Jason Gideon, behavioral analysis.

535
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,400
We both deal with the dysfunctional.

536
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,400
Happily, in my line, the end results
aren't quite as unpleasant as yours.

537
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,000
Unless you're the Crawford family.

538
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,500
Or the Millers. You knew them both.

539
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,100
Yes. I knew them, but...

540
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,200
ma'am.

541
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,100
I think you should take a seat.

542
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,900
Why?

543
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,800
We're gonna have to check your alibi.

544
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,500
Dig all you want. I have 4 teenagers.

545
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,000
If I had any time to myself

546
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,800
it wouldn't be spent killing my clients.

547
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,000
You worked with both families?

548
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I assessed their cases.

549
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,300
This office deals with hundreds of families--military

550
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,700
cops, lawyers, congressmen, feds.

551
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,000
I only met the Crawfords and Reese Miller once.

552
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,900
But you prescribed medication for them.

553
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,300
I'm the only medical doctor here.

554
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,300
Who'd you hand the cases over to?

555
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,400
Uh, I'll have to check my files.

556
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,200
You don't use a computer?

557
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,600
Not all of us have embraced the technical revolution.

558
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,700
I keep everything filed. It makes me feel more in control.

559
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,300
And please...do not read into that.

560
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,500
The Crawfords.

561
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,800
Karl Arnold dealt with their case.

562
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,900
What about the Millers?

563
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,000
I'd like to see him now.

564
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,400
Well, you can't. He works a 4/40--4 10-hour days.

565
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,600
He's off today, but he'll be in first thing tomorrow.

566
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,000
Do you have his home address? 

567
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,000
I'll get a team out to his house.

568
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,200
In the meantime, we'd like to see his office.

569
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,900
Suspect's cell is goin' straight to voice mail.

570
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,700
Karl's a good man.

571
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,400
That's what everybody says

572
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,100
until they find a body in the basement.

573
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:51,900
It's locked.

574
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,900
I'll get security.

575
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,200
No. We don't have time for that.

576
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,100
Someone will have to pay for that.

577
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,500
Karl Arnold will.

578
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,100
Gideon.

579
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,100
Where is he now?

580
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,300
I can't believe Karl--

581
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,600
Where is he?

582
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,200
I don't know. If he's not at home,

583
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,300
maybe he's gone to see his family.

584
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,300
He's married?

585
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,500
With 2 children--Karl Jr. And Sarah.

586
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,700
How long ago did the marriage collapse?

587
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,100
About 5 years ago.

588
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,800
It wasn't a good time for Karl. He--

589
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,500
he took some time off work.

590
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,400
He couldn't concentrate. He started...

591
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,500
drinking.

592
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:42,900
Yeah?

593
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,600
I can't bel--maybe you've got it wrong.

594
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,800
I would've seen--

595
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,900
Oh, my god. I feel sick.

596
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,000
Where does Karl's family live?

597
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,500
She took the kids and moved to Idaho.

598
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,300
They just raided Karl's home.

599
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,600
He's not there.

600
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,500
Cut it out, now, both of you!

601
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,500
Sarah, Karl Jr, go do your homework.

602
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,700
Hello?

603
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,100
Wait. I'm sor--I can't hear--shh!

604
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:30,900
What did you say?

605
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,900
Faye Arnold, this is federal agent Aaron Hotchner.

606
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,600
I'd like to know where your ex-husband is.

607
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,000
As long as he's nowhere near me

608
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,200
I don't give a damn.

609
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,100
We really need to find him.

610
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,400
When was the last time you saw him?

611
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,200
I--I haven't seen him in over 2 years.

612
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,600
He--he--he's a scary guy.

613
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,700
But...he did call me about an hour ago.

614
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,600
I wish he would just go to hell and stay there.

615
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,600
What did he say?

616
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,500
He just...babbled on about how precious family is and...

617
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,000
did he say where he was?

618
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,400
No. No. He--he just wanted to talk to the kids.

619
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,200
He said he'd just met a little girl that reminded him of my Sarah.

620
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,600
Did he seem upset, anxious, confused?

621
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,300
Seemed like he always is--

622
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,300
angry, controlling, manic.

623
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,200
Do you have any idea where he might be?

624
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,300
No. But I--I did hear kids in the background.

625
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,600
And--and--and then someone started to cry.

626
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,800
That's when he hung up.

627
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,600
Thank you.

628
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,200
Arnold called his wife.

629
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,600
She heard kids in the background.

630
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,600
He's already in another family's house.

631
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Hotch, there's gotta be hundreds of families here.

632
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,600
Then we'll send an agent to every last one of them if we have to.

633
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,500
Karl Arnold--he has a boy and a girl

634
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,000
just like the Millers and the Crawfords.

635
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,300
Target family would be the same.

636
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,600
How could I not have seen it?

637
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,000
Because he's that good. If he wasn't

638
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,500
we would have caught him sooner.

639
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,400
Does he have a journal?

640
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,600
He writes everything down, takes it everywhere.

641
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,200
It's likely he also collects trophies.

642
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,100
If they're not in his house

643
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,700
they're right here, hidden in this room.

644
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,100
What does he mean by trophies?

645
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,100
From the families he killed.

646
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,900
If he doesn't confess, we'll need 'em as evidence.

647
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,900
Here's one--the Harrises, one boy, one girl.

648
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,500
Can I see it?

649
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,100
I got a few. The Boyds and the Dunkens.

650
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:06,500
Wait. The Dunkens. That's not one of his cases. That's mine.

651
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,000
They have a baby boy

652
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,700
and a slightly introverted 8-year-old named Jackie.

653
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,000
Jackie...

654
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,000
Jackie's work?

655
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,700
He took it from my office.

656
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,900
Were they planning a trip?

657
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,000
To the adirondacks.

658
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,400
Let's go. Hotch, tear up the room.

659
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,000
Here, take this. I call you some backup.

660
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,500
We've got 3 adults and 2 children sitting at the dining room table.

661
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,100
FBI! FBI!

662
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,600
He's got my baby!

663
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,500
Ma'am, is he alone?

664
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,200
My baby!

665
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,100
Where's the basement?

666
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,100
Under the stairs!

667
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,200
Son of a bitch.

668
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,100
Get 'em outta here. Get them outta here!

669
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,400
Gideon. Gideon!

670
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,700
Karl?

671
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,700
Karl, it's the FBI.

672
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,500
Karl?

673
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,500
Why don't you give me the baby?

674
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,600
Karl?

675
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,000
Karl, I want you to look at me.

676
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,800
I'm gonna put my gun away...

677
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,800
And I want you to hand me that baby.

678
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,700
Give me the baby.

679
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,000
You move, I'm gonna break your neck.

680
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,100
Hello.

681
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,900
Let's go.

682
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,400
- How are you?
- Keep it moving.

683
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,700
Did he say anything?

684
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,800
No.

685
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,800
Can we tie him forensically to the other crimes?

686
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,600
Negative on foreign DNA.

687
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,400
He must have washed Crawford's clothes.

688
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,800
Then we'll need a confession.

689
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,100
Can you get one?

690
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,300
Did you do what I asked?

691
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,300
Yeah.

692
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,200
Then maybe.

693
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,200
Emily Crawford was a very talented and gifted girl.

694
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:33,100
Her brother Sam, a bright, energetic child.

695
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,600
You watched them from the yard for days, maybe even weeks.

696
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,300
You learned everything about them

697
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,900
studied their every move

698
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,300
and then you wrote it all down.

699
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,200
May I have a glass of water?

700
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,500
Something wrong?

701
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,800
No, I'm just thirsty.

702
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,000
Water, please.

703
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,800
Could you remove my shackles? I'm clearly no threat to you.

704
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,000
They stay on.

705
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,700
You chose families that reminded you of the one you lost.

706
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,900
You stalked them, you bound them, you terrorized them

707
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,600
then you killed them...one by one.

708
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,100
We have your journals, Karl.

709
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:23,700
It's my job...to write everything down, to get to know them.

710
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,900
I can't help them solve their problems without knowing background.

711
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,800
And I make home visits...

712
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,900
sometimes without their knowledge because people lie.

713
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,700
You, of all people, should know that.

714
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:47,900
Eric Miller was an awful husband and father.

715
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,400
Allison Crawford hemorrhaged money her husband didn't have.

716
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,200
It can strain any marriage.

717
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,100
On the surface, this looks like any family, U.S.A.

718
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,500
2 parent household, 2 kids, boy and a girl.

719
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,400
If you look a little closer

720
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,800
you'll see their body language tells a different story.

721
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,300
The woman and children are distant from the man.

722
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,400
Their smiles are stiff. Their eyes are frightened.

723
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,400
Every hair is in place, wearing their sunday best

724
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,800
their own private hell being memorialized on film.

725
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,300
Are you OK?

726
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,700
It isn't right.

727
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,700
What isn't?

728
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:41,400
You've got the pictures mixed up!

729
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,900
The one in the middle, that is Sam Crawford's.

730
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,400
It should be Ty Miller's!

731
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,400
You need...to swap them. You need to make it right.

732
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,000
This one here?

733
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,900
What the hell have I been trying to tell you?

734
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,200
You're right. They're switched.

735
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,900
That is Sam Crawford's foot with the Miller family

736
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,600
but how did you know that, Karl?

737
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:35,100
And I watched them for a number of days, always at night.

738
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,600
Saw how they lived. How they loved.

739
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,300
I would keep them apart...

740
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:46,400
until the last night, till the last supper.

741
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,900
Then I would bring them, one by one...

742
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,400
down to the basement.

743
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:00,200
The youngest first. The father last.

744
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,600
Why, karl?

745
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,800
So he could see...

746
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:12,000
what happens to families when the head of household...

747
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,100
isn't strong.

748
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,800
Wives wither.

749
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,400
Children perish.

750
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,200
But me?

751
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,000
I'm an excellent father.
