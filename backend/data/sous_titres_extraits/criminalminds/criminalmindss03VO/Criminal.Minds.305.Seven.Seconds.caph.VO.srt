00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,080
Paging katie jacobs.

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,530
{\a6}POTOMAC MILLS,VIRGINIA

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,400
Please report to security immediately.

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,890
Katie jacobs,please report to security.

5
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,470
911. State your emergency.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,800
My niece,she's gone.

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,310
She's--she's missing. Her mom
and her dad are still looking.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,540
We can't--we
can-- oh,my god.

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,590
Ma'am,where are you?

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,420
In the,uh--in the
mall,in potomac mills.

11
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,740
She's only 6. Her mom
and dad can't find her.

12
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,000
Who am I speaking with?

13
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:34,460
Susan jacobs.

14
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,880
Susan,can you tell me your niece's name?

15
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,120
Katie. Please come quick.

16
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,580
- Security's just
not- - katie what?

17
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,600
Um,jacobs.

18
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,650
And where was katie last seen?

19
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,290
This isn't happening.

20
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,770
Ma'am,stay with me.

21
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,590
What if someone took her like
the little girl last week?

22
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,650
- Ma'am- -
oh,my god.

23
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,520
Attention,all patrons.

24
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,550
This is an emergency announcement.

25
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,280
We have gone into immediate
lockdown procedure.

26
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:15,630
Please follow all directions of law
enforcement and security personnel.

27
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,360
Attention,all patrons.

28
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,420
This is an emergency announcement.

29
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,190
We've gone into immediate
lockdown procedure.

30
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,850
Please follow all directions of law
enforcement and security personnel.

31
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,620
Where are the parents?

32
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,560
Over here with the head of security.

33
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,770
Ms.Samuels,thank you.

34
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,290
No problem.

35
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,680
Mr.And mrs.Jacobs,I'm james franklin,

36
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,690
Director of the bureau's
rapid deployment team.

37
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,490
We need a photo of your
daughter. You have one on you?

38
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,280
There was another little girl
who went missing last week.

39
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,280
Maybe on your phone.

40
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,390
Got a picture of katie on your phone?

41
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,080
She disappeared from a mall,too.

42
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,030
She was murdered,right?

43
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,280
Ma'am,it's too early to know
if that case is connected.

44
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,700
Yeah,why so many fbi?

45
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,200
Standard operating procedure.

46
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,010
I've also alerted our
behavioral analysis unit.

47
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,960
If there is a pattern to these
abductions,they'll find it.

48
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,180
Thank you.

49
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,240
Stay with them.

50
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,310
Jim.

51
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,090
We've been in lockdown
for almost 20 minutes.

52
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,390
My team's already in motion.

53
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,270
Another female,same
age,same time of day,

54
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,890
Taken from essentially
the same location.

55
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,960
What makes you sure katie
jacobs is still in the building?

56
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,580
The mall's got cameras installed
at every entrance and exit.

57
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,020
Surveillance video confirms
katie entering the building,

58
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,440
But no sign of her leaving.

59
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:35,330
Security paged her over the intercom,and
their initial sweep came up empty.

60
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,720
Whoever killed jessica davis
last week left that mall with her

61
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,880
Because he wanted time
with his victim in privacy.

62
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,460
Assuming it's the same offender,he
wouldn't stray from his M.O.

63
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,010
He wouldn't leave here
without his victim.

64
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,450
So if katie's still under
this roof,so is her abductor.

65
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,520
Garcia,report to the
mall's security office.

66
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,540
Reid,morgan,I want you to
find the head of security.

67
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,650
We need all data from every search team.

68
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,270
You guys start with katie's parents.

69
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,670
We'll treat the mall
like a neighborhood,

70
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,300
And we'll separate into
areas of control. Come on.

71
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:07,110
117 stores,uh,69 storage
closets,73 dressing rooms,

72
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,350
6 men's rooms,6 ladies' rooms,

73
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,580
Exits to the rooftop via the
north and south stairwells,

74
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,050
7 restaurants,each with
separate kitchen,and 4 elevators.

75
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,370
Every team's gonna need a copy of this.

76
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,440
Katie was last seen by her cousin
in the arcade about 25 minutes ago.

77
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,960
She was wearing jeans,a green
shirt,gray sneakers,and ponytails.

78
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,890
Registered offenders located
within a 45-mile radius.

79
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,980
Ok,run this against current
and former employees as well.

80
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,570
If this animal so much as looks
at me wrong once we get him...

81
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,940
I read the jessica davis report.

82
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,800
I know you found the remains last week.

83
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,740
20 years,never seen anything like it.

84
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,790
Can't get the image out of my head.

85
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,950
I joined the bureau to rescue people,not
to stand over another dead kid today.

86
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,750
I couldn't handle it.

87
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,850
Hopefully you won't have to.

88
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,800
It's all chance,you know.

89
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,770
Wrong place at the wrong time.

90
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,250
No logic. No sense.

91
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,440
How does a parent reconcile that?

92
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,010
They never do.

93
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,950
You want every inch of
surveillance footage?

94
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,100
Yes,because I need to examine
it frame by frame to see

95
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,760
If there's anything in the
background you guys missed.

96
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:15,000
I also need a joystick
controller,video transmitters,

97
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,010
A coax cable,and a programmable park.

98
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,310
And I don't mean that hypothetically.

99
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,250
Ms.Jacobs' cell phone
had katie's picture on it.

100
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,990
Mall security helped us make copies.

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,250
Ok,we need to get one of these to every
search team,every officer,every patron.

102
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,070
Potential witnesses need to
know who we're looking for,too.

103
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,230
Problem is our unsub
could be any one of 'em.

104
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,140
There's her parents.

105
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:52,670
Hi.

106
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,280
We're agents jareau and
prentiss with the B.A.U.

107
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,070
And you must be katie's aunt and uncle.

108
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,390
This can't be easy.

109
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,380
We're here to walk you through this.

110
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,820
Well,aside from the
stairwells,storage closets,

111
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,740
And hundreds of shops,there's a
whole underbelly beneath our feet--

112
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,330
Subterranean level,air
ducts,boiler rooms.

113
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,980
Realistically,it'll take at least...

114
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,430
3 hours to cover this place.

115
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,330
Realistically,we have
less than half that time.

116
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,090
How do you figure?

117
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,900
99% of abducted children who are
killed die within the first 24 hours,

118
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,650
75% within the first 3 hours,

119
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,090
And what only law enforcement knows is
jessica davis joined the 44% of children

120
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,870
Who are abducted and killed
within the first hour.

121
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,750
Yeah. What do you got?

122
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,070
Ok,so this is surveillance footage
off an exit camera outside the arcade.

123
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:37,990
Well,can't you get a better angle?

124
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,050
Sugar,I'm not london here.

125
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,290
I can only work with what they have.

126
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,250
Believe me when I tell
you the 1980s just called.

127
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,000
They want their security system back.

128
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:48,840
Ok,look in the far right,middle
section. You see the 2 ponytails?

129
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,020
Yeah. That's katie.

130
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,400
Angle barely got an image of
her,let alone who she was with.

131
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,050
Can you enhance the image for me?

132
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,560
I could start the process. We
don't have that kind of time.

133
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,110
Aw,you are breakin' my heart,baby girl.

134
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,320
Where are you goin'?

135
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,180
And who are you with?

139
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,570
Dostoevsky once said,

140
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,450
"nothing is easier than
denouncing the evildoer.

141
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,530
Nothing more difficult
than understanding him."

142
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,980
Katie jacobs.

143
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,850
This image was captured moments before
your nephew reported katie missing.

144
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,390
Oh,god.

145
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,540
I know the angle's limited,

146
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:02,630
But is there anything or anyone
in the frame that you recognize?

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,730
- No.
- No.

148
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,470
Katie has asthma. She needs her inhaler.

149
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:14,190
H-how could someone have just taken
her in front of all those people?

150
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,740
That's what we're trying to figure out.

151
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,410
How do you plan on doing that?

152
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,740
We're retracing katie's steps.

153
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,470
We're going over surveillance footage.

154
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,670
We're searching every crack
and crevice under this roof.

155
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,320
I want to be out there
looking for my girl.

156
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,000
I'd want to be doing the same
thing,but when an abduction is reported,

157
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,270
The parents are debriefed separately.

158
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,450
It's more efficient that way.

159
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,480
What do you wanna know?

160
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,890
Did katie have any connection
at all to jessica davis?

161
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,480
No.

162
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,820
There is no connection.

163
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,960
Maybe a dance class,a church group.

164
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,090
You think katie will end up like that?

165
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,180
No,now,mrs.Jacobs,just
listen to me here.I'm just--

166
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,700
is that what you're trying to tell me?

167
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,380
I'm trying to find your daughter.

168
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,980
Look at me.

169
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:02,830
I know it's excruciating
at a time like this,

170
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,580
But I have to ask these questions,ok?

171
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,380
Just breathe.

172
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,540
Ok.

173
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,360
I want you two to take this path.

174
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,900
I'll meet you there.

175
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,960
Katie.

176
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,120
Katie jacobs.

177
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,950
Katie jacobs.

178
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,110
So she and her cousin came
in here about 30 minutes ago,

179
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,890
And that was the last
time anyone saw katie?

180
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,090
That's right.

181
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,780
10 minutes after the assault is generally
the molester's lowest point of self-esteem.

182
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:37,610
He could be panicking right about
now,realizing he's got a witness.

183
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,230
Richard allen davis strangled polly klaas
just to prevent her from identifying him.

184
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,320
A single abduction like this would
normally be classified as a snatch-and-grab,

185
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,960
But with the jessica davis abduction,

186
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,090
It's more likely we're dealing
with a preferential offender.

187
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,040
Whose victims fall
into a particular type.

188
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,890
He came to this mall knowing
what he was looking for,

189
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,250
Because he feels safe
here,familiar with his surroundings.

190
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:59,180
So when you and your cousin
were going in and out of stores,

191
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,950
Did anybody try to talk to her?

192
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,790
I don't think so.

193
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,590
Did somebody maybe compliment her
hair or open the door for you guys?

194
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,200
He wasn't exactly paying attention.

195
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,910
- Yes,I was.
- Yeah.

196
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,510
You'd think after all
my years in retail,

197
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,330
I'd hate the mall,but it was convenient.

198
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,170
She was right next to me,I swear.

199
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,940
And then we split up,because I-- I
had to shop for my husband's birthday.

200
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,930
And that's when you got lost
in that video game,right?

201
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,450
I should have stayed near the kids.

202
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,450
It's not fair.

203
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,440
And now I wish we never
left the house this morning.

204
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,940
I'm sure that's how
my brother feels,too.

205
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,640
How are all these questions getting
us any closer to finding her?

206
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,070
Assuming that she knew not
to walk off with a stranger,

207
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,690
It means she might have trusted the
offender,which can tell us a lot.

208
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,600
Well,then explain to
me what happened to her.

209
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,320
She might have walked off
with someone in uniform.

210
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,760
No,I meant jessica.

211
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,180
I wanna know what happened to that girl.

212
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,410
Katie.

213
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,000
Katie.

214
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,420
Katie jacobs.

215
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,670
Katie.

216
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,110
Katie jacobs.

217
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,580
Katie.

218
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,400
You know,this may all be a mistake.

219
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:11,450
Katie might just be lost,maybe
in some bookstore or something.

220
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,160
She loves to read.

221
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:16,020
You know,she could just be
in a corner,just,you know--

222
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:20,530
Or maybe playing dress-up
in a store or something.

223
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,670
Katie.

224
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,030
Katie jacobs.

225
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,550
Jeremy,we--we asked your mom and
dad if we could talk privately.

226
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,200
Thought it might be easier that way.

227
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,420
'Cause my dad thinks this is my fault.

228
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,200
No.

229
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:51,070
Jeremy,your dad is just
super upset right now,

230
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:55,060
Because times like this,people
get really emotional.

231
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,060
Hey,kid...

232
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,930
The moments right before a kidnapping
like this are the most important.

233
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,870
You gotta understand you're the
only one who can help us with that.

234
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,820
But--but I
can't remember.

235
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:11,190
Jeremy,all we need is the
last thing katie did or said

236
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,360
Before you realized she was gone.

237
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,520
Jeremy.

238
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,330

Jeremy--what?What?What?

239
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,000
What is it? Talk to me.What?

240
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,000
I can't breathe.

241
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,530
Uh,y-you're having a
panic attack. Sit down.

242
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,100
Jeremy,sit down. Sit down.

243
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,270
Want you to put your
head between your knees.

244
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,020
Put your head between
your knees. That's right.

245
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,990
Just breathe. Just breathe.

246
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,260
Is that katie's?

247
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,560
Yeah.

248
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,860
She didn't like it
with her sneakers today.

249
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,110
Said it didn't match.

250
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,370
Would you mind if we
borrowed that sweater?

251
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,160
Why?

252
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,490
It would help the search
dogs to pick up her scent.

253
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:35,010
Whoever abducted katie did so
by looking at her as an object.

254
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:39,580
If there's the slightest
chance that he has a conscience,

255
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:42,610
It may help to remind him she's not.

256
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,180
And,uh,how would you do that?

257
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,110
Well,we wouldn't.

258
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,050
You would.

259
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,430
Hotch.

260
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,560
Thank you.

261
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:04,590
My guess is jeremy either heard or
saw something that could be useful.

262
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,910
But the guilt has manifested itself
into an acute stress disorder.

263
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,570
The kid can't remember a thing.

264
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,840
Take him back to the scene
and do a cognitive interview.

265
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:13,970
Ok.

266
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,700
Do you have kids?

267
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,210
No. Not yet.

268
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,430
But everyone that needs
us,we think of as our own.

269
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,620
I don't know if I can do this.

270
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,030
Ok,just--just
stay calm.

271
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,570
Don't address what he's done.

272
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,680
That'll only make him defensive.

273
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,200
Ready.

274
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,480
Just keep the focus on katie.

275
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,810
All right,we need him
to hear who she is.

276
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,670
No one knows that better than you.

277
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,070
My name is beth jacobs.

278
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:09,170
45 minutes ago,our
daughter katie went missing.

279
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,760
She's only 6 years old.

280
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,400
Last month,she started first grade.

281
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:24,500
Katie is our only child,and
we love her very much.

282
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:28,470
We just want her back safe.

283
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,480
The other day...

284
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,660
Katie told me that she
was ready to ride...

285
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,890
A big girl's bike...

286
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,780
Without training wheels...

287
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,710
And I promised her that she
could do that on her birthday.

288
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,100
Please,whoever you are...

289
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,050
I hope you're listening.

290
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:10,540
We just want our daughter
back to us safely.

291
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:21,100
Katie is just a little girl.

292
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:24,390
She's just a little girl who
deserves another birthday.

293
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:36,590
Only 7 seconds I was able to
decipher,but it's 7 more than we had.

294
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
What are we looking at?

295
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,840
Surveillance footage I retrieved f
ofa second camera on the first floor.

296
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,610
It shows katie exiting the arcade,follows
her movements through the crowd.

297
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,100
She went north.

298
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,230
UNABLE TO LOCATE MATCHING SUBJECT

299
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,640
Till she disappears.

300
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,860
Criminy. I still can't
make out who she was with.

301
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,770
7 seconds...

302
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,030
That's all the images I could find,sir.

303
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,870
Is all it takes for
a child to disappear.

304
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,990
If katie was alone,

305
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,530
The only stores in the vicinity she would be walking
toward would be furniture, Stationary,or bedding.

306
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,100
Nothing that a 6-year-old
would leave an arcade for.

307
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:08,030
Unless it wasn't a store
that caught her eye.

308
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:11,770
I once followed todd cortel the entire
length of silver beach because he had a kite.

309
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,830
The right bait might lure
her away from the crowd.

310
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,660
So what are you youngsters
playing these days?

311
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,080
I like...

312
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,660
D.O.A.

313
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,130
D.O.A.?

314
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,820
- As in "dead on arrival"?
- It's "dead or alive."

315
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,450
What do you like so
much about it,jeremy?

316
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,170
The close combat.

317
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,740
It's all about timing,how
well you know your enemies.

318
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,120
Plus I'm really good at it.

319
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,800
Yeah,I bet you are,kid.

320
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,680
So,uh,what was the first game that You
walked to when you came in here earlier?

321
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,930
Girl's trail stops cold?

322
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,530
Because that vent is depositing
air from the food court,

323
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,910
The dog is overwhelmed by the smell.

324
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,180
Katie.

325
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,360
Katie jacobs.

326
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:16,320
I'm sorry,ma'am. I
can't let you do that.

327
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:18,260
But I'm his mother,for god sake.

328
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,300
Look,I understand.

329
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,150
I'll take care of this.

330
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,360
Jeremy is talking with 2
of our agents right now.

331
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,600
Well,then,I should be there,too.

332
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:28,180
Whatever's blocking your son's
memory may be exacerbated by that.

333
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:31,840
He might be feeling a
bit responsible somehow.

334
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,390
One minute,you're having a
lighter engraved for your husband,

335
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,840
And the next minute,katie's
name is being paged.

336
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,050
I never thought something like
this could happen to our family.

337
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,420
Nobody ever does.

338
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,130
What are they doing to my son?

339
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,370
It's a sensory method of questioning.

340
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,820
We're hoping it'll help jeremy remember what
happened before he realized katie was gone.

341
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,280
I'm gonna ask you to close your
eyes for a minute,all right?

342
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,920
I want you to go back to when you first
walked in the arcade a little earlier.

343
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,600
Can you remember that?

344
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,020
Yeah.

345
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,430
You're doin' great,my man.

346
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,140
Ok,in your mind,I want you to try
and picture what it sounded like ine.

347
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,350
Her picture what it smelled like.

348
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,130
Was it crowded?

349
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,320
It was loud.

350
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:23,860
Were the people loud,or
were the sound effects loud?

351
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,070
Both.

352
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,060
Some kid was yelling at his game.

353
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:30,900
Die!

354
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,240
I own you.

355
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,800
You're mine. Now die!

356
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,920
Jeremy,I don't like it here.

357
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,880
Well,tough,because I do.

358
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,740
I want to find my mommy.

359
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,800
Stop whining. I gave you a quarter.

360
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,560
Now go play a game.

361
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,940
Die,die,die.

362
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,350
Die,die,die.

363
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,980
Die,die,die.

364
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,430
What's making you so
uncomfortable,jeremy?

365
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:09,370
I don't like it in here. Jeremy.

366
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,900
What was she crying about?

367
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,130
I don't remember.

368
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,930
- I-- I couldn't
hear. - Ok.

369
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,370
Jeremy,go back to the video game.

370
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,030
I was winning.

371
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,960
And how'd that make you feel?

372
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:38,420
Awesome,proud of
myself,kind of embarrassed.

373
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,080
Embarrassed? How?

374
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:43,170
Like people were watching me.

375
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,550
Why were you self-conscious
who was watching you?

376
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,910
I could smell her shampoo.

377
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,580
Katie's?

378
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,800
No.

379
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,840
Please,I wanna go.

380
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,570
Can we please go?

381
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,120
Die.

382
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,350
Jeremy,I don't like it here.

383
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,930
You like that game,huh?

384
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,900
You wanna play?

385
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,250
We can switch back and
forth for combo attacks.

386
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
Please can we go?

387
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,640
Please,jeremy.

388
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,970
Get out of here.

389
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,240
I have extra quarters.

390
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,920
Please,jeremy.

391
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:26,370
I want an ice cream.

392
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,720
Katie?

393
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,520
- Katie?
- So katie was asking for ice cream?

394
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,790
Yeah.

395
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,180
Was there something else?

396
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,160
No.

397
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,110
You did good,kid.

398
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,100
Picked up katie's scent
on something in here.

399
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:01,190
Just a lot of half-eaten
food,empty cups.

400
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,470
And this.

401
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,530
What'd you find?

402
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,950
It's a necklace in the trash.

403
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,660
Bag it and label it in
case there's any connection.

404
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,290
There is.

405
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,510
Katie was wearing it.

406
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,460
She found it in the
schoolyard about a year ago.

407
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:22,120
This is 24-karat gold,and
the stones are real.

408
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,180
Whoever lost it would
have been looking for it.

409
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,400
Is there any reason that
katie would have lied?

410
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,850
No.

411
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,960
How far do you live from here?

412
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:30,880
About a mile.

413
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,620
Do you mind if we search your house?

414
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,720
Of course not.

415
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,980
What do you think
you're gonna find there?

416
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,650
It's just protocol.

417
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,520
Excuse me.

418
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,750
What is he not telling us?

419
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:52,190
The clasp is damaged,like it
was ripped off of her neck.

420
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,780
Then they tossed it in the trash.

421
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:57,130
If the abductor just wants to fulfill his
urge and move on,he wouldn't take the time.

422
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,330
This is motivated by
rage. It's personal.

423
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,430
David westerfield kidnapped danielle van dam
out of revenge when her mother rejected him.

424
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,930
This may not be related to
last week's abduction after all.

425
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,740
Somebody lit a fire last night.

426
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,240
Well,there's dirty dishes
for 3 in the kitchen,

427
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,910
So they eat together as a family.

428
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,970
Hey,my favorite movie
from when I was a kid.

429
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,250
So they watch movies together,too.

430
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:45,300
By a fireplace in a house that's
in a cookie-cutter neighborhood.

431
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:48,440
Norman rockwell couldn't
have painted this any cozier.

432
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,520
That's what worries me.

433
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:56,670
Is there anyone in your life
you would consider a threat?

434
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,150
Why would you ask me that?

435
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,460
We have to explore every possibility.

436
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,410
I don't understand.

437
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,740
Now you don't think it's
connected to the other case?

438
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,640
We're not sure.

439
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:08,300
Why would someone we know do this?

440
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,330
Katie jacobs.

441
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,870
I just have a couple of
questions I want to ask you.

442
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,360
Are there any families in your
neighborhood that you don't get along with?

443
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,540
My neighborhood?

444
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:22,350
- Or an employee that you might have fired?
- No.

445
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,210
- Or any child that katie
might have upset? - H-hold on.

446
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,600
Where are you going with this?

447
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,090
Katie's necklace didn't
fall off by itself,

448
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,280
And it's possible that
she knows the offender.

449
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:33,960
Ah,that's crazy. I
mean,w-why would any--

450
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,560
no,no.

451
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,910
We get along with everyone
in our neighborhood,

452
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,360
And,uh,katie loves all of
her--all of her friends at school.

453
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,530
I mean,I,uh--I taught
my daughter well.

454
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,890
Why would you say,"i've
taught my daughter well,"

455
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,150
And not,"we've taught her really well"?

456
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,070
You know what I mean.

457
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,490
Why are you looking at me like that?

458
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,390
Are there marital issues
that I should know about?

459
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,050
Are you kidding?

460
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,420
Are either of you having an affair?

461
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,900
You son of a bitch!

462
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,520
- My daughter is missing,and you
wanna turn this around-- - I know that

463
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:08,670
I'm concerned with finding her,which
is why i've asked you the question.

464
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,860
My family means everything to me.

465
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,000
Finding katie is everything to me.

466
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:29,400
No,we are not participating
in any affairs.

467
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,720
Ok.

468
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,460
Katie jacobs.

469
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,930
Katie jacobs

470
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:41,500
Katie.

471
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:44,270
Katie jacobs.Katie.Katie.

472
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,960
Katie's been wetting her bed.

473
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,970
A lot of 6-year-olds
do. Could be bad dreams.

474
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,890
Some kids won't get up at night,'cause
they're afraid of the dark.

475
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,360
Or it could be a lot
more complex than that.

476
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,840
Most girls covet their dolls
like an extension of themselves.

477
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,150
Reid,I know
these signs--

478
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,880
acting out on her toys,wetting the bed.

479
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:13,610
She's obviously covering up
something about that necklace.

480
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,900
Is there something else?

481
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:18,740
No.

482
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,550
And her cousin might be
holding something back.

483
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:26,260
Katie's in a lot of pain and not
telling anybody,and I think I know why.

484
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,410
Yeah?

485
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:34,400
Hotch,I think katie's being
molested,and we both know the odds.

486
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,410
Most likely by somebody
under the same roof.

487
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,080
Mr.Jacobs bought his
own daughter a necklace,

488
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:46,660
Nobody would think twice about
that,so why would katie lie?

489
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,450
She didn't...

490
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,910
Because her father didn't
buy her the necklace.

491
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,160
Get back here as soon as you can.

492
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,960
We need to separate the boy
and his father,2 rooms. Now.

493
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,450
Katie jacobs.

494
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,610
Katie.

495
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,230
No,sir.

496
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,240
What's going on here?

497
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,140
We're questioning
jeremy in another room.

498
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,540
I know that. Why?

499
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,700
We suspect that he may know something.

500
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,540
About katie?

501
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:22,690
From you,mr.Jacobs,we'd like
to know more about your son.

502
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,630
What's going on?

503
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,960
Did you find katie?

504
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,020
Jeremy,how old are you?

505
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,240
- 13
- 13

506
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,300
You know,when I was 13,I was
starting to notice girls,too.

507
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,820
I was
curious,but,uh--heh.

508
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,920
I was--I
was,like,really awkward,

509
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:53,980
So it was super hard for me
to talk to them,and I,uh--

510
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:56,470
I Found that incredibly frustrating.

511
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,260
Why are you telling me this?

512
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,010
'C ause I think I understand you.

513
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,310
You're,uh-- you're
in the arcade.

514
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,300
Pretty girl walks in,and,uh...

515
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:07,950
You get distracted by the--the
scent of her hair,right?

516
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,690
I guess.

517
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,700
So what?

518
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:14,610
So you're-- you're
becoming a man. It's--heh.

519
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,080
Believe it or not,it
happens to all of us.

520
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,330
There's nothing wrong with that at all.

521
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,720
Never said there was.

522
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:25,910
And these video games that you
play,these cool video games allow you to,

523
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,710
to explore your violent side. Right?

524
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,030
So,I mean,clearly you're intrigued.

525
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:37,320
My only question is whether or
not you acted on these curiosities,

526
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:40,060
You've experimented yet.

527
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,950
Shouldn't you be looking
for my cousin right now?

528
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,410
I am looking for your cousin right now.

529
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,840
Why are you asking me these questions?

530
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:51,230
Why are you avoiding them?

531
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,260
What would you like to know?

532
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,240
What jeremy's interests are.

533
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,660
Uh,computer.

534
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:04,270
Likes to be on the computer.
Spends hours at a time.

535
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,900
What's going on?

536
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,500
Who does he socialize with?

537
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,860
I don't know.

538
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:12,540
Kids at school,I suppose.

539
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:16,610
You live under the same roof,but
you can't name any of his friends?

540
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:21,960
He spends hours in his room listening
to that metal music I don't understand.

541
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:25,650
Has he always been this distant
with you,or is this something new?

542
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,140
Well,I
guess--

543
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,350
I guess it's always been like this.

544
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,020
That's why I don't find it odd.

545
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:36,050
Well,we did some checking,and,uh...

546
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:39,910
We found out that jeremy,at
the ripe age of 13,has a record.

547
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,910
For stealing,6 months ago.

548
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,900
We knew that.

549
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:45,460
And that didn't strike you as odd?

550
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,700
He stole earrings for a girl he liked.

551
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,530
When I was his age,I-- I
probably did the same thing.

552
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,490
He must have really wanted
to make an impression on her,

553
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,520
Make her feel special,because we checked
the record, And they were very valuable.

554
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,750
We reprimanded him. What was her name?

555
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,260
Who?

556
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:09,420
The girl jeremy liked
so much he stole for.

557
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,520
I--I
don't know.

558
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:14,060
We're his parents. He's 13 years old.

559
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,340
If he hadn't been arrested,

560
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:20,500
We probably wouldn't even know
that he was interested in girls.

561
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,530
J.J.,Can I get a minute?

562
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,370
Excuse me. Where's my brother?

563
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,950
He's being questioned,sir.

564
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,840
About jeremy?

565
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,410
You think jeremy knows something?

566
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,420
We don't know the answer to that yet.

567
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,880
Oh,god.

568
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,470
Believe me,when we do know something,

569
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,260
You guys'll be the first people we tell.

570
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,660
W-we have to trust that.

571
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,420
Excuse us.

572
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,130
Well,that was strange.

573
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,360
What?

574
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,270
You would think during a time like this,

575
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,100
Susan would wanna know why
her son's being detained.

576
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,070
She didn't even look
to us for an answer.

577
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,890
Look at her. She's
relaxed enough to sit down.

578
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,400
Maybe protecting what
composure she has left?

579
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:14,740
Or protecting someone else.

580
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:17,500
Hey,jeremy,do you know
what I do for the fbi?

581
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,320
No.

582
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:20,510
Study human behavior.

583
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,050
Like,uh,the way you're pushing
your chair away from me,

584
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:28,340
It tells me that what I'm saying
is making you uncomfortable,like,

585
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:31,000
Uh,you're trying to
distance yourself from me,

586
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:33,830
Maybe from what I'm capable
of reading about you.

587
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,210
Whatever.

588
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,980
Case in point: You
bite your inner cheek.

589
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:42,870
It's a-- it's a nervous tic,like
you're holding on to something.

590
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,630
Doing it right now.

591
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,390
You were also doing
it inside the arcade,

592
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:51,170
And I think you were doing it
because maybe-- I don't know--

593
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:54,260
Maybe you remembered something
more than what you told us.

594
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:57,270
No. I told you everything.

595
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:59,920
I don't know. I don't think
you told us everything.

596
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,700
I think something else
happened inside that arcade,

597
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:05,070
Something-- something you
haven't told anybody yet.

598
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,240
Mr.Jacobs,have a seat.

599
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:18,440
Did,uh,jeremy and katie
spend a lot of time together?

600
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,940
Our families spend a
lot of time together.

601
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,450
He likes his cousin.

602
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,280
Does that make you jealous?

603
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,270
What?

604
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,640
Why would it?

605
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,650
Why would it?

606
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:37,500
We found that in the trash.

607
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:45,580
How is it that you know your 6-year-old
niece likes to read books and play dress-up,

608
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,920
But you don't know the first
thing about your own son?

609
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:50,290
Typically molesters only pay
attention to the children that

610
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,110
They're grooming,ignoring
even their own.

611
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,480
Katie wore that necklace
because you told her to,

612
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,760
Because you told her she was special.

613
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:01,500
As if the sexual abuse wasn't enough.

614
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,840
Is that when it started?

615
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:04,710
- When what started?
- When you gave katie the necklace,

616
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,140
When she started wetting the bed,

617
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:10,160
When her parents came to you and susan wondering
Why their daughter locked herself in her room.

618
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:12,940
Was that when it started? Is
that when the molestation started?

619
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,430
This is ridiculous.

620
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,900
Couldn't help yourself,could you?

621
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:16,620
You're crazy!

622
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,680
Like so many little girls before.

623
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,230
- I--I wanna get outta here. - You
started spending more time with her

624
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,950
and telling her she was special.

625
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,490
- I'm not listening to you.
- You knew it was sick,

626
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,070
- your brother's own daughter.
- Shut up!

627
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,510
- Did she outgrow your preference?
- Shut up!

628
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,200
- Did she get too old for you?
- No!

629
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,820
No.

630
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,940
I may have done some things that...

631
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:52,330
You couldn't possibly understand,

632
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:56,330
but I would never hurt katie.

633
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:14,750
Whoever ripped the necklace
off katie did it in a rage,

634
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,360
And he just seems... Broken.

635
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,070
One minute,I'm having a
lighter engraved for my husband,

636
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,400
And the next minute,katie's
name is being paged.

637
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,610
You know,for probably the most
stressful day of your life,

638
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:35,110
I haven't seen you light one cigarette.

639
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:39,720
I quit over a month ago.

640
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,900
You'd think after all
my years in retail,

641
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:46,450
I'd hate the mall,but it was convenient.

642
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:56,450
I don't think the aunt is telling us
everything,and this could get dicey.

643
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,440
- Susan- -
what is it?

644
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:03,240
- Uh,I need to speak with susan.
- Why?What happened?

645
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,400
Did you find her?

646
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,120
No. Not yet.

647
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,730
- What--is it
about jeremy? - No.

648
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,480
- Richard?
- I need to speak with you.

649
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:09,440
Come this way.

650
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:11,170
What are you doing? What's this about?

651
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,220
You used to work in retail?

652
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,630
I'm sorry. How does that-

653
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,960
- should be able-
- I understand.

654
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,570
You mentioned it earlier.

655
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,450
So what?

656
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:22,550
What you didn't tell me was you
used to work in this mall years ago.

657
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:24,720
What does that have to do with anything?

658
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,260
Susan,do you know something?

659
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:29,950
You know this building
like the back of your hand.

660
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,770
Earlier,you made sure to
separate from the group.

661
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,070
Someone tell us something!

662
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,030
What the hell is happening?

663
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,170
God,susan! What do you know?

664
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,640
- Oh,god.
- Come on.Let's go.

665
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,870
- Susan,what- - what
did you do to katie?

666
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,630
- Susan!
- What did she do?

667
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,520
What did she do to her?

668
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,210
What did you do with katie?

669
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,790
Why would you ask me that?

670
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,680
You and richard have been
playing the happy family,

671
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:01,380
When the truth is you've been separated.

672
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,190
Why else didn't you realize he hasn't
had a cigarette in over a month?

673
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,950
He has no use for a new lighter.

674
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,550
Richard and I have been
trying to work things out.

675
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:14,600
Did you really believe that getting rid of
that little girl would take away his sickness?

676
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:18,820
You're not making a bit of sense.

677
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,940
Did it occur to you last week?

678
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,160
After you saw on the news that

679
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:27,310
A little girl was snatched from a
local mall and found dead 3 days later?

680
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:30,940
There are 2 seasonal storage
closets at the end of that hall,jim.

681
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:33,650
You check those. We'll
take the ones upstairs.

682
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:36,580
Did you duct-tape her mouth,too?

683
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:39,280
You know,if you do that to
someone with asthma,they could die.

684
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:41,630
But I guess you already
figured that out.

685
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,730
This was not supposed
to happen to my family.

686
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,290
It didn't just happen,susan.

687
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:50,260
You took her,a 6-year-old
vulnerable child who trusted you,

688
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:52,170
who trusted your husband.

689
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,850
You need to tell me where she is.

690
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,880
I don't know what you're talking about.

691
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:09,530
This is how katie sees herself,

692
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:15,480
self-loathing,dirty,disgusting.

693
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:19,460
- That is what your husband made her feel.
- No.

694
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,580
Those nights that she
would stay at your house,

695
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:25,140
He would sneak into her room
and tell her not to make a sound.

696
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,240
No,please don't do this.

697
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,530
Do you have any idea how
terrified she must have been,

698
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:34,480
How confused,while you lay
awake protecting an animal

699
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:37,810
Who will always have
those urges and always has.

700
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,350
Don'T. Please don't.

701
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,450
There's nothing left
for you to protect,susan.

702
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,000
Instead of shielding her from more pain,

703
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,820
You blamed her for your own.

704
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,540
No,no,no.

705
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,510
Yes,you did.

706
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,660
You have robbed katie of her childhood,

707
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:53,440
Are you gonna steal the rest
of her life from her as well?

708
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:55,570
No! Enough!

709
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:58,660
Where is she?

710
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,980
Katie! Katie!

711
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:13,760
Pick it apart,guys--
every box,every shelf.

712
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:14,380
Katie!

713
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:15,290
Katie!

714
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,390
Katie!

715
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,080
This whole pile back here.

716
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,840
I need 2 guys in this aisle.

717
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:20,790
Check up in here.

718
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,300
Jim,why don't you check this room.

719
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:26,030
Katie!

720
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,960
You guys,in this room. Let's go.

721
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:29,070
Katie!

722
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,130
Katie!

723
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,290
I got her! I got her!

724
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,130
Hey,we need a medic.
Somebody move.Let's go.

725
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,640
I can't feel a pulse.

726
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,430
Tip her head back,open her airway.

727
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,310
Ready? 1,2...

728
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,660
Come on,katie.

729
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,520
Katie!

730
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:19,730
Come on,sweetie. Come
on,sweetie.Wake up.

731
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,680
Is katie gonna be all right?

732
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,870
She will eventually.

733
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,070
I heard her call my mom's name.

734
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,780
That's what I remembered before.

735
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,500
We get it,kid.

736
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:08,090
That's your mom.

737
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,030
What's gonna happen to me now?

738
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,610
I don't know,jeremy,but,uh,

739
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,640
We're gonna make sure
you're all right,ok?

740
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,080
Let's go.

741
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,840
Susan consoling katie's mother,

742
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,230
That's an image that's
gonna haunt me for a while.

743
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:39,640
Well,we could have been
left haunted by a lot worse.

744
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,160
Thing is there's still a guy
out there who hasn't been caught.

745
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:13,950
I know.

746
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:17,050
And there always will be.

747
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,250
But today we made a difference.

748
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,030
Tell you one thing,if
I had a kid back home,

749
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,280
I wouldn't still be standing here.

750
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,810
I'll see you around.

751
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,460
Take it easy.

752
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,030
- She's coming.
- Thanks.

753
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:49,750
He's asleep.

754
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,530
Just 5 minutes.

755
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,370

Fairy tales do not tell
children that dragons exist.

757
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:23,360
Children already know
that dragons exist.

758
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,320
Fairy tales tell children
that dragons can be killed.
