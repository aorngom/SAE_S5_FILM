00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,780
Wai-wai-wai-wait!

2
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,820
Just--just look at me!Please!

3
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,280
Is this--is this the hospital?

4
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,570
D-did I make it out?I made it!

5
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,840
This isn't the hospital.

6
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,790
Oh god,please,please,please.

7
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,540
Please.

8
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,370
A NIGHT IN THE SHOW 
Featuring Charles Chaplin

9
00:01:30,922 --> 00:01:34,012
- You're not teaching today?
- This afternoon.

10
00:01:34,892 --> 00:01:38,392
- What's this?
- It's genius.

11
00:01:38,402 --> 00:01:41,352
You have chaplin on film?

12
00:01:41,362 --> 00:01:44,302
My great-granddad was an accountant 
at one of the first movie studios.

13
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:47,562
- He lived in california?
- No,no,no.Chicago.

14
00:01:47,572 --> 00:01:50,832
Essanay studios.Closed 1920.

15
00:01:50,842 --> 00:01:54,982
Back then,you had 4 of 5 movies made in the U.S.
They were all made in chicago.

16
00:01:55,632 --> 00:01:57,882
They closed down and let my grandpa take A...

17
00:01:57,892 --> 00:02:01,512
- Eh,a couple of extra prints home.
- They let him?

18
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:05,112
Well,that's the family story.
We're stickin' to it.

19
00:02:07,742 --> 00:02:09,572
This guy's a genius.

20
00:02:09,582 --> 00:02:11,912
How come you haven't brought these in before?

21
00:02:11,922 --> 00:02:13,992
Showing it to my cadets today.

22
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:17,752
I try to leave 'em with some kind of strategy 
for dealing with the stress the job brings.

23
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,312
Like comedy.

24
00:02:19,322 --> 00:02:22,432
Greatest gift my granddad ever left me.

25
00:02:23,002 --> 00:02:27,242
What's going on in here?Oh,mr.Chaplin.
The funny guy.

26
00:02:28,672 --> 00:02:33,632
You know,if what i hear is true about that man,
that right there was the original player.

27
00:02:34,062 --> 00:02:37,862
Ok,but,guys,seriously,
what's up with the rickety projector?

28
00:02:37,872 --> 00:02:39,372
They don't have this on dvd?

29
00:02:39,382 --> 00:02:42,662
Hey,some people like things run 
through a projector.

30
00:02:42,672 --> 00:02:46,422
I think I'm gonna let you 
two old-timers do your thing.I'm out.

31
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:49,392
Hey,I got a couple little tramp reels 
if you have time.

32
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,862
I got a few minutes.

33
00:02:55,662 --> 00:02:58,192
That'S...

34
00:03:03,562 --> 00:03:06,442
- Agent jareau?
- It's open.

35
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:09,922
Detective mcgee,kansas city P.D.
I called last week.

36
00:03:10,222 --> 00:03:12,742
About some missing people in downtown kansas city.

37
00:03:12,752 --> 00:03:14,452
Uh,right,right.Um...

38
00:03:14,462 --> 00:03:17,272
I'm sorry.
Didn't i ask you to send me your files first?

39
00:03:17,282 --> 00:03:21,872
Yeah.Um,about that,
I--I don't,uh,have any files.

40
00:03:21,882 --> 00:03:23,622
No--no one's actually been reported missing yet.

41
00:03:23,632 --> 00:03:26,842
- It's--it's more like a theory.
- Theory.

42
00:03:26,852 --> 00:03:28,662
Yeah.Um...

43
00:03:29,172 --> 00:03:34,462
Brought you the most relevant ones.
I have,um,like,40 more of them.

44
00:03:38,192 --> 00:03:41,432
I catalogue everybody I come in contact 
with on the street-- 

45
00:03:41,442 --> 00:03:45,912
um,names,descriptions,uh,
what they're wearing,identifying marks.

46
00:03:45,922 --> 00:03:48,512
Anyways,my department assigned
 me to keep an eye on downtown,

47
00:03:48,522 --> 00:03:53,102
uh,skid row,dopers,um,hooker stroll,
whatnot.Typical stuff.

48
00:03:53,452 --> 00:03:58,062
And everything was going good until I started 
noticing there were less and less every week.

49
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:00,882
- Of...
- Of--of them.

50
00:04:00,892 --> 00:04:04,942
Less vagrants,less--less prostitutes,
less junkies strung out on the corners.

51
00:04:04,952 --> 00:04:06,872
Well,sounds to me like you're doing a good job.

52
00:04:06,882 --> 00:04:09,732
Yeah,that's what my bosses think.
I actually,uh...

53
00:04:10,652 --> 00:04:14,182
Got an award last week from the mayor's office.

54
00:04:17,822 --> 00:04:19,862
- So...
- So I'm not doing it.

55
00:04:19,872 --> 00:04:23,482
Crime went down because the people
 committing the crimes have disappeared.

56
00:04:23,492 --> 00:04:29,662
And--and then,over the last several weeks,
people seem to be disappearing at a couple a day.

57
00:04:29,672 --> 00:04:34,332
Isn't that the nature of these particular groups
 is that they're transient?

58
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:36,722
No.No.N-not this many this fast.

59
00:04:36,732 --> 00:04:40,272
I-I'm telling you,I can--
I can talk to somebody at lunch,

60
00:04:40,282 --> 00:04:43,602
and by dinnertime,they're wiped off 
the face of the earth.

61
00:04:43,612 --> 00:04:47,592
- Ok.Um,how many is it?
- 63

62
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,372
- 63 people?
- At least 63.

63
00:04:52,382 --> 00:04:56,722
63 people that i regularly used to see 
are just not there anymore.

64
00:04:56,732 --> 00:04:59,402
And then last week,I,um...

65
00:05:00,082 --> 00:05:03,132
I got this in the mail at the stationhouse.

66
00:05:03,142 --> 00:05:07,512
There are two types of people in the world.
Those who do the work and those who take the credit.

67
00:05:07,522 --> 00:05:09,202
You should be ashamed.

68
00:05:09,212 --> 00:05:13,422
Somebody else knows that I'm getting 
praised for something that I did not do.

69
00:05:13,432 --> 00:05:17,782
63 people.
You're--you're sure about this?

70
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:20,612
Something is happening out there,agent jareau.

71
00:05:22,012 --> 00:05:25,002
Something bad.

75
00:06:03,682 --> 00:06:06,122
You aren't sure whether anyone is in fact missing.

76
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:09,572
No,I--I am sure.
I just can't seem to convince anyone else of it.

77
00:06:09,582 --> 00:06:12,362
- There's been no official investigation?
- No.

78
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,272
63 people can't be coincidence,right?

79
00:06:15,282 --> 00:06:20,302
Reid,any stats on the percentages of,um
well,I don't really know how to phrase the question.

80
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:21,852
Homeless who go missing?

81
00:06:21,862 --> 00:06:25,942
The very nature of homelessness suggests 
a lifestyle of fluidity,yet 

82
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,682
honestly,they're not as transient 
as you would think.

83
00:06:27,692 --> 00:06:32,912
They generally stay in small,well-defined areas
 based on familiarity and what services are nearby.

84
00:06:32,922 --> 00:06:35,722
So--so you're saying they don't just disappear.

85
00:06:35,732 --> 00:06:39,672
Not normally,but I mean,
that doesn't preclude the possibility.

86
00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:42,722
Names,addresses,descriptions.

87
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:46,442
Do--do you have any information
 that might help us find them again?

88
00:06:46,452 --> 00:06:47,992
I--I didn't have a need for it at the time.

89
00:06:48,002 --> 00:06:51,772
Do you have enough here to see 
if they've been reported missing by someone?

90
00:06:51,782 --> 00:06:53,352
I don't-- I don't know.

91
00:06:53,362 --> 00:06:56,492
I--I ran them all through our computers 
and came up blank.

92
00:06:56,502 --> 00:07:00,442
None of them turned up deceased?
Checked the morgues and the hospitals?

93
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:03,282
I--I have checked everywhere,sir.

94
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:05,482
Simply being gone isn't a federal issue.

95
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:09,262
We're gonna need an official invitation 
into your jurisdiction.

96
00:07:10,232 --> 00:07:12,872
- An official?
- Police chief,chief of detectives.

97
00:07:12,882 --> 00:07:16,642
It has to come down through the chain of command.
We have no authority to look into this.

98
00:07:17,752 --> 00:07:20,122
Um,I don't know that I-- I can do that.

99
00:07:20,132 --> 00:07:23,452
Unless we're officially asked,we can't help you.

100
00:07:23,462 --> 00:07:28,722
Jurisdictional issues aren't open for debate.
Sorry.It's out of our hands.

101
00:07:29,652 --> 00:07:32,202
Uh,hotch...

102
00:07:32,212 --> 00:07:36,322
There could be 63 victims here.

103
00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:42,962
Well,I suppose you and I could go back 
with the detective and talk to his commanders 

104
00:07:42,972 --> 00:07:45,162
and try to impress upon them 
the serious implications.

105
00:07:45,172 --> 00:07:46,802
Thank you.

106
00:07:46,812 --> 00:07:49,072
If we get an invitation,
we could send for the rest of you.

107
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:51,472
I just don't want to give the appearance
 that we're running over them.

108
00:07:51,482 --> 00:07:53,832
I'll wrap my class up.

109
00:07:53,842 --> 00:07:56,812
If anything changes,let me know.
I should be available by 4:00.

110
00:07:56,822 --> 00:08:00,732
- J.J.Be ready in 30.
- Agent.Um,sir.

111
00:08:00,742 --> 00:08:04,422
- He--he took 2 of my book-
- uh,if you could leave your notebooks with us,

112
00:08:04,432 --> 00:08:08,142
we can unofficially go over them and
 maybe develop some more information.

113
00:08:08,152 --> 00:08:12,462
How about I show you,uh,which people aren't
 around anymore and you can copy down all the information.

114
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,652
Ok.Well,you heard agent hotchner.

115
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:17,242
You got 30 minutes to brief us on 63 people.

116
00:08:17,252 --> 00:08:19,392
Ok.Um...

117
00:08:21,672 --> 00:08:24,412
Of all the preposterous assumptions of humanity,

118
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:29,172
nothing exceeds the criticisms made of the habits
 of the poor by the well-housed

119
00:08:29,182 --> 00:08:33,232
well-warmed,and well-fed.Herman melville.

120
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:39,222
- Landing in 10 minutes.
- What?

121
00:08:39,822 --> 00:08:43,782
- We're landing in 10 minutes.
- Already?

122
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:46,132
It's a fast plane.

123
00:08:48,982 --> 00:08:53,032
- He's really into those notebooks.
- Almost obsessional.

124
00:08:54,252 --> 00:08:56,732
You mean clinically obsessional.

125
00:08:56,742 --> 00:08:58,932
Obsessive note-taking could be a form of O.C.D.

126
00:08:58,942 --> 00:09:02,452
So the only witness we have to any of this 
might be mentally unstable?

127
00:09:02,462 --> 00:09:06,092
- That's possible.
- This may be be a wild-goose chase.

128
00:09:06,102 --> 00:09:10,992
But as someone I greatly respect suggested,
63 people may be in trouble

129
00:09:11,002 --> 00:09:13,852
and I think that that's worth the chase.

130
00:09:25,862 --> 00:09:29,122
- Damn.
- That is a lot of people.

131
00:09:29,132 --> 00:09:33,652
Homeless men,homeless women,runaways,
prostitutes,and drug users.

132
00:09:33,662 --> 00:09:36,912
Can all of their disappearances be a coincidence?

133
00:09:36,922 --> 00:09:39,072
Yeah,technically it wouldn't really 
be a coincidence

134
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:42,412
since a number of these people share high-risk traits,
which throws the curve off.

135
00:09:42,422 --> 00:09:43,612
You see,the word "coincidence" implies more-

136
00:09:43,622 --> 00:09:46,732
Hey,kid,we do not need
 a vocabulary lesson right now.

137
00:09:46,742 --> 00:09:49,402
Right.Sorry.

138
00:09:50,402 --> 00:09:53,122
What was it the yorkshire ripper 
said about his victims?

139
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:57,972
The women I killed were filth,
bastard prostitutes that were littering the streets.

140
00:09:57,982 --> 00:10:00,012
I was just cleaning up the place a bit.

141
00:10:00,022 --> 00:10:01,832
He's a housecleaner.

142
00:10:01,842 --> 00:10:05,012
Mission-based killer who believes his murders 
are helping society.

143
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:08,092
These guys devolve rapidly until 
they're just killing machines.

144
00:10:08,102 --> 00:10:11,002
And our hands are tied by jurisdictional concerns?

145
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:12,432
Well,what are we supposed to do?

146
00:10:12,442 --> 00:10:16,372
If we don't follow the city's jurisdiction,
no one's gonna ever ask us for help.

147
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:19,922
We do it by the book.
Then we pray...

148
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,942
That no one else gets hurt in the meantime.

149
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:42,262
You're kidding me,right?
You got nothin' I need.

150
00:10:42,272 --> 00:10:44,942
Someone wants company.

151
00:10:44,952 --> 00:10:46,462
What,like a date?

152
00:10:46,472 --> 00:10:49,532
- I'm supposed to take you.
- In this?

153
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:52,992
- Get in.
- Slow down.

154
00:10:53,412 --> 00:10:57,622
- Private party's gonna cost about 500 bucks,baby.
- Get in.

155
00:10:57,632 --> 00:11:01,332
But you're all right with that,500 bucks,cash?

156
00:11:01,342 --> 00:11:03,902
He'll pay.Get in.

157
00:11:03,912 --> 00:11:05,832
You're a twitchy little thing,aren't you?

158
00:11:05,842 --> 00:11:09,702
No.Use the side door.
No one can see you.

159
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:12,382
Yeah.Whatever.

160
00:11:17,972 --> 00:11:20,262
All right,you beautiful thing,you.

161
00:11:20,592 --> 00:11:22,722
Talk to me.
Tell me you got something I can work with.

162
00:11:22,732 --> 00:11:25,772
Oh,I wish I could,
but i've gone through 41 names so far

163
00:11:25,782 --> 00:11:28,762
and none of them reported missing in any database.

164
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,502
- Come on,girl.Not one?
- No.

165
00:11:30,512 --> 00:11:33,642
I even went interpol on it.
Big fat zero.

166
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:37,342
- Damn.
- It's unbelievably sad,isn't it?

167
00:11:37,872 --> 00:11:40,382
All right.
Well,just keep doing your thing,all right?

168
00:11:40,392 --> 00:11:44,042
- Let me know if you find anything with the rest of the names.
- Ok.

169
00:11:55,812 --> 00:11:59,822
What'd you do to yourself,girl?

170
00:12:13,462 --> 00:12:15,902
That driver...

171
00:12:20,192 --> 00:12:22,792
What is it he gave me?

172
00:12:27,602 --> 00:12:29,842
What the hell?

173
00:12:30,632 --> 00:12:35,562
You took my shoes?
What are you,some kind of freak?

174
00:12:52,102 --> 00:12:55,182
Let me outta here!

175
00:13:32,602 --> 00:13:36,322
Look,if this is your idea of a joke,
I'm not laughing.

176
00:13:48,212 --> 00:13:52,512
Oh,you're gonna pay for this,freak.
Believe me.

177
00:14:26,552 --> 00:14:29,052
I'm hurting.

178
00:14:29,062 --> 00:14:31,862
I cut myself.

179
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:36,112
Would somebody please help me?

180
00:14:37,722 --> 00:14:41,382
Would somebody please help me in here?

181
00:14:53,872 --> 00:14:56,332
Police Department 
KANSAS CITY,KANSAS

182
00:14:56,342 --> 00:14:58,602
This is my desk over here.

183
00:15:00,952 --> 00:15:03,242
- Is this your commander's office?
- Yeah.

184
00:15:03,252 --> 00:15:06,732
- Uh,i'm--I'm gonna go talk to him first.
- Sure.

185
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:12,622
This is the neatest detective's desk 
I have ever seen.

186
00:15:14,132 --> 00:15:17,512
You did--you did what?
Call you back.

187
00:15:18,562 --> 00:15:20,972
I'm guessing it didn't go too well.

188
00:15:23,462 --> 00:15:24,902
I'm captain wright.

189
00:15:24,912 --> 00:15:28,862
Agent hotchner.This is agent jareau.
We're with the fbi's behavioral analysis unit.

190
00:15:29,752 --> 00:15:33,582
- Listen,guys,I don't know what detective mcgee here told you-
- yes,you do.

191
00:15:34,012 --> 00:15:37,572
I told them that there's a large number of 
people missing from my area of responsibility.

192
00:15:37,582 --> 00:15:39,922
No.You think there are a large number
 of people missing.

193
00:15:39,932 --> 00:15:43,292
- We discussed this last week.
- He informed you of this before?

194
00:15:43,302 --> 00:15:45,902
Agents,we have run every one of the names 
from his little books

195
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:48,552
and we couldn't find a single missing report.

196
00:15:48,562 --> 00:15:52,542
Tell him what the other agent said about-- 
about homeless people not going missing like this.

197
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,382
That's not exactly what he said.

198
00:15:54,392 --> 00:15:59,192
Listen,guys,I-I'm really sorry you came
 all this way,but we don't need any fbi help.

199
00:15:59,202 --> 00:16:02,172
May I have a word with you in your office?

200
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:05,762
Uh,yeah,sure.Sure.Right this way.

201
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:11,482
You should have told us he already knew.

202
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:16,892
Would you have come?

203
00:17:04,722 --> 00:17:06,562
Any news?

204
00:17:06,572 --> 00:17:08,622
Haven't heard from hotch or J.J.

205
00:17:08,632 --> 00:17:12,102
Garcia went through all the names but couldn't
 find a single report to hang an investigation on.

206
00:17:12,112 --> 00:17:15,912
We've been compiling preliminary profile thoughts
 based on the limited victimology that we have.

207
00:17:15,922 --> 00:17:17,652
Profile?We don't even have this case yet.

208
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,922
We just want to be prepared in case 
we are called in.

209
00:17:19,932 --> 00:17:24,492
- We don't have enough other work to do?
- Gideon,he's a housecleaner.

210
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:28,442
With 63 potential victims.

211
00:17:31,922 --> 00:17:34,632
What have you come up with so far?

212
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:06,442
I can't believe he did this.

213
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:09,982
Well,detective mcgee is pretty sure 
that these people are missing,sir.

214
00:18:09,992 --> 00:18:13,322
- Now,detective mcgee is...
- A little obsessive-compulsive?

215
00:18:13,332 --> 00:18:16,912
- Oh,you noticed that,huh?
- Doesn't mean he can't be a good cop.

216
00:18:17,482 --> 00:18:21,712
I thought assigning him to keep an eye 
on skid row would be harmless.

217
00:18:21,722 --> 00:18:25,162
Well,most of those people only 
cause trouble for each other.

218
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:34,222
Is this the envelope the letter came in?

219
00:18:34,522 --> 00:18:37,372
Yeah.They dusted for prints.It's clean.

220
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:46,672
You've only been a cop for 4 years 
and you're already a detective.

221
00:18:46,682 --> 00:18:50,952
Yeah,they,uh...Promoted me to keep me away
 from the general public.

222
00:18:51,192 --> 00:18:53,812
That's why I'm baby-sitting skid row.

223
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:57,192
Look,I'm sorry he got you to travel 
all the way here.

224
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:59,482
Sir,we're happy to help with the problem.

225
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,862
What problem?

226
00:19:01,872 --> 00:19:05,892
Sir,63 people missing from 
a localized area is unusual.

227
00:19:05,902 --> 00:19:10,242
Are you kiddin' me?Bums,whores,junkies.

228
00:19:10,642 --> 00:19:12,332
Can these people even be missing?

229
00:19:12,342 --> 00:19:14,912
You seem hostile to the idea that these
 people could be in trouble.

230
00:19:14,922 --> 00:19:19,332
No,what I'm hostile to is a member of my 
command recruiting the fbi to handle a case 

231
00:19:19,342 --> 00:19:20,772
that I don't even believe is happening.

232
00:19:20,782 --> 00:19:24,202
You know,the note he received could 
be an unsub reaching out.It's not uncommon.

233
00:19:24,212 --> 00:19:27,232
Or it could be another cop 
who's pissed off that mcgee got an award.

234
00:19:27,242 --> 00:19:29,922
Sir,this type of unsub is relatively
 easy to catch.

235
00:19:29,932 --> 00:19:33,092
- Nobody else has to get hurt.
- As far as I know,no one has been hurt.

236
00:19:33,102 --> 00:19:37,962
I have some experience in this field,and I believe
 that your problem's only going to get worse.

237
00:19:37,972 --> 00:19:40,572
Oh,well,thank you.We'll keep an eye on that.

238
00:19:40,582 --> 00:19:42,612
You have a safe trip home.

239
00:19:42,622 --> 00:19:44,322
- What if they were cheerleaders?
- Excuse me?

240
00:19:44,332 --> 00:19:46,262
Or teachers?Or mothers?

241
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:48,952
How did you put it?Can bums even 
be missing?Well,sir,they can.

242
00:19:48,962 --> 00:19:51,922
They can be hurt,they can be scared,
and they can be killed.

243
00:19:51,932 --> 00:19:55,592
- You must really care about these people.
- It's my job to care about them.

244
00:19:57,532 --> 00:20:00,972
Most cops would say it's their job 
to keep 'em in line.

245
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:03,722
Yeah,well,my father taught me to be 
a different kind of cop.

246
00:20:03,732 --> 00:20:06,532
Was he a detective,too?

247
00:20:06,542 --> 00:20:10,202
Yeah,he was a-- he was killed 
in the line of duty in '85.

248
00:20:10,912 --> 00:20:12,782
I'm sorry.

249
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:15,752
Captain wright was his partner.

250
00:20:15,762 --> 00:20:18,162
It's the only reason the department keeps me on.

251
00:20:18,172 --> 00:20:20,612
I'm sure that's not the only...

252
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,052
- This postmark.
- Excuse me?

253
00:20:26,062 --> 00:20:27,602
- Kansas city.
- Right.

254
00:20:27,612 --> 00:20:29,632
Missouri.We're in kansas city,kansas.

255
00:20:29,642 --> 00:20:31,742
Yeah,well,they're just across the river
 from one another.

256
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:34,922
No,what they are is right across the state line.

257
00:20:38,162 --> 00:20:40,412
- Hotch,it's federal.
- What?

258
00:20:40,422 --> 00:20:42,252
If we want this case,it's ours.It's federal.

259
00:20:42,262 --> 00:20:45,412
This letter came from across the river,
from kansas city,missouri.

260
00:20:45,422 --> 00:20:47,932
- Interstate communication.
- Puts it in federal jurisdiction.

261
00:20:47,942 --> 00:20:51,582
Sir,this is now a federal case.
I would like to retain detective mcgee as a consultant.

262
00:20:51,862 --> 00:20:54,692
You're not opening any investigations 
in my jurisdiction.

263
00:20:54,702 --> 00:20:57,362
I don't want a fight with you.
Even though this is a federal case,

264
00:20:57,372 --> 00:21:00,872
If we develop any information,
I will come to you and your men will make the arrest.

265
00:21:00,882 --> 00:21:02,742
And why would you do that?

266
00:21:02,752 --> 00:21:05,392
Because that's how we operate.

267
00:21:35,092 --> 00:21:37,812
Anybody there?

268
00:21:38,712 --> 00:21:41,692
Hello?I cut myself in here.

269
00:21:41,702 --> 00:21:44,302
Is somebody there?

270
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:51,302
- Do you wish to know the future?
- What?

271
00:21:51,312 --> 00:21:55,572
Would you like to see exactly
 how your day is going to end?

272
00:22:10,752 --> 00:22:13,532
Oh,god,no.No.

273
00:22:26,337 --> 00:22:30,147
Oh,please,I have a baby

274
00:22:30,157 --> 00:22:32,817
Her name is sheila may.Please.

275
00:22:32,827 --> 00:22:35,817
I just want to go see my daughter.

276
00:22:37,467 --> 00:22:39,947
I know you're there.

277
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:44,937
Why--why are you doing this to me?
What did I do to you?

278
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,867
What did you do?

279
00:22:47,877 --> 00:22:50,767
What is the legacy of a whore,maggie?

280
00:22:52,047 --> 00:22:55,967
Aids,syphilis,gonorrhea,herpes

281
00:22:55,977 --> 00:22:59,817
hepatitis,disease,and filth.

282
00:22:59,827 --> 00:23:01,687
What did you do?

283
00:23:01,697 --> 00:23:05,657
- You...Were...You.

284
00:23:15,617 --> 00:23:18,747
- B.A.U.
- I'm jason gideon.

285
00:23:18,757 --> 00:23:22,047
- Agents morgan,prentiss,and dr.Reid.
- Captain alright.

286
00:23:22,057 --> 00:23:25,847
If you,uh,want to get your squad together,
captain,we could start giving the profile.

287
00:23:26,117 --> 00:23:28,257
- Already?
- We've been working on it all day.

288
00:23:28,267 --> 00:23:32,077
- Oh,have you,now?
- Just out of an abundance of preparedness,yeah.

289
00:23:32,087 --> 00:23:34,827
Give me a few minutes,guys,huh?

290
00:23:35,637 --> 00:23:37,277
I'm not sure if he's really ok with this,

291
00:23:37,287 --> 00:23:40,707
or he's sure we're wrong 
and wants to see us embarrass ourselves.

292
00:23:43,747 --> 00:23:46,107
I don't have any diseases.

293
00:23:46,117 --> 00:23:49,067
I just went to the clinic.I'm clean.

294
00:23:49,077 --> 00:23:52,157
You don't even know the meaning of the word.

295
00:23:53,287 --> 00:23:56,447
Now,you have been judged and sentenced...To death.

296
00:23:56,857 --> 00:24:00,117
No.Pl-please,don't kill me.

297
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:02,937
I have a daughter.I will do anything you want.

298
00:24:02,947 --> 00:24:06,197
I assure you,I'm not without compassion.

299
00:24:06,207 --> 00:24:10,497
You are roughly in the center of
 a 130,000-square-foot facility.

300
00:24:11,237 --> 00:24:14,307
You have until sunrise to
 find your way out of here.

301
00:24:14,677 --> 00:24:19,167
If you don't,your sentence will be carried out.

302
00:24:19,787 --> 00:24:22,707
You only have a few hours,maggie.

303
00:24:24,647 --> 00:24:27,857
We're going to provide a psychological
 profile of the man we're looking for.

304
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:33,177
It contains some unusual,specific personality traits 
that someone out there is bound to recognize.

305
00:24:33,557 --> 00:24:36,437
Which will make him relatively easy to locate.

306
00:24:36,447 --> 00:24:41,687
Long-lasting,negative impression
 he leaves on anyone he might meet.

307
00:25:12,637 --> 00:25:15,627
We have a term for the killing behavior
 this unsub displays--

308
00:25:15,637 --> 00:25:19,717
Cleaning house-- fixing 
what's wrong with the world.

309
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:23,997
He's deeply rationalized this behavior,
and while he certainly knows the killing is wrong,

310
00:25:24,007 --> 00:25:27,477
he truly believes that 
he's doing the world a great service.

311
00:25:27,487 --> 00:25:30,397
Ultimately,this type of unsub becomes a loner.

312
00:25:30,407 --> 00:25:32,437
There will not be too many people 
that can still tolerate him.

313
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:36,507
Now,if he does have a relationship at all,
the person will not be his equal.

314
00:25:36,517 --> 00:25:38,447
It'll be someone subservient to him.

315
00:25:38,457 --> 00:25:42,367
He'll be fastidious,
tending toward obsessive- compulsive disorder,

316
00:25:42,377 --> 00:25:46,557
and he'll have an overwhelming sense of indignation 
towards the things that he's judged to be wrong.

317
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:49,337
He wouldn't even consider the reasons
 why someone might disagree with him.

318
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:53,207
- He sounds like a real jagoff.
- Exactly.Class-a scumbag.

319
00:25:53,217 --> 00:25:56,967
Detective mcgee started noticing the disappearances
 a year ago.

320
00:25:56,977 --> 00:25:59,467
The unsub probably had a stressor at this time-- 

321
00:25:59,477 --> 00:26:04,127
the death of a family member or someone
 who had some semblance of control over him.

322
00:26:04,137 --> 00:26:07,237
Right now,no one has control over him.

323
00:26:08,577 --> 00:26:12,377
It's probable that he isn't currently working 
after this many victims 

324
00:26:12,387 --> 00:26:17,827
And the devolution that it brings a job just 
wouldn't leave him time to practice his true calling.

325
00:26:17,837 --> 00:26:23,097
- Which is...
- A predator,a killing machine.

326
00:26:23,747 --> 00:26:26,437
By now,it's become all he thinks about.

327
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:04,387
It's not fair,you son of a bitch!

328
00:27:54,147 --> 00:27:55,937
SLAUGHTERHOUSE

329
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:11,599
What are you lookin' at?

330
00:28:11,609 --> 00:28:13,499
Just want to ask you a few questions,my man.

331
00:28:13,509 --> 00:28:17,849
- About what?
- Unfamiliar faces walking around here.

332
00:29:01,379 --> 00:29:04,239
Is there anything I can do for you?
Get you to a shelter,maybe?

333
00:29:04,249 --> 00:29:06,519
Have you ever seen one of them shelters?

334
00:29:06,529 --> 00:29:08,629
I'll take my chances in the park.

335
00:29:08,639 --> 00:29:10,829
At least I got the birds I can feed there.

336
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:13,039
Ok.Ok,I understand.

337
00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:14,959
Be careful,you hear me?

338
00:29:14,969 --> 00:29:18,869
This world needs all of its beautiful ladies,
and that means you,too,mona.

339
00:29:23,249 --> 00:29:25,779
You're a good guy.

340
00:29:25,789 --> 00:29:27,619
- You think?
- Yeah.

341
00:29:27,629 --> 00:29:30,229
You make the people around you feel good.

342
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:32,119
Well,he's no charlie chaplin.

343
00:29:32,129 --> 00:29:34,209
- Again with the chaplins.
- How'd you guys do?

344
00:29:34,219 --> 00:29:36,599
Well,reid got propositioned by
 every prostitute we talked to

345
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:39,009
but we didn't find anybody 
who thinks they'd seen the unsub.

346
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:41,869
- Same story with us.
- We saw gideon and mcgee a block back.

347
00:29:41,879 --> 00:29:43,689
- They hadn't had any luck,either.
- It's odd.

348
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,739
If the unsub were out here,he'd stand out.

349
00:29:45,749 --> 00:29:48,719
- You know,people would recognize the description.
- So where does that leave us?

350
00:29:48,729 --> 00:29:51,459
Right where I thought we were.

351
00:29:51,469 --> 00:29:54,729
- Captain?
- You said this guy would definitely be memorable.

352
00:29:54,739 --> 00:29:56,159
You were adamant.

353
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:59,899
So if no one out here remembers him,
according to you,he doesn't exist.

354
00:29:59,909 --> 00:30:02,849
- That's not exactly what we said,but-
- It's what you implied.

355
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:04,429
What do you think happened to them,captain?

356
00:30:04,439 --> 00:30:06,699
I told you,I don't think anything happened to them.

357
00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:08,879
Oh,that's right.
You think they all got houses and jobs.

358
00:30:08,889 --> 00:30:12,099
Ok,all this means is we have 
another piece of the puzzle here.

359
00:30:12,109 --> 00:30:16,749
Someone got over 60 street-smart people
 out of here and no one noticed.

360
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:18,559
It's almost like he blended in.

361
00:30:18,569 --> 00:30:21,959
It's more than that.
It's like he must somehow belong.

362
00:30:21,969 --> 00:30:25,029
- Like he's here all the time.
- Like social services.

363
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,129
What?

364
00:30:26,139 --> 00:30:27,779
- Captain wright.
- Yeah?

365
00:30:27,789 --> 00:30:30,919
- Does your social services department patrol around?
- Excuse me?

366
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:33,159
Do they drive around in the middle of 
the night looking for people to help?

367
00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:36,009
No.They have to be called,and then-- 

368
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:38,439
Morgan!

369
00:30:38,699 --> 00:30:42,039
Mona!Mona,wait a minute!
Do not get in that van!

370
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:45,769
What are you doing?
I thought you didn't need any help.

371
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:48,149
He's gonna drive me to the park.

372
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:50,489
Hey,how's it goin',my man?

373
00:30:50,499 --> 00:30:52,599
- I should go.
- Slow down.What's your hurry?

374
00:30:52,609 --> 00:30:54,449
I got a lot of work.I should go.

375
00:30:54,459 --> 00:30:57,719
- Sir,do you have a city employee I.D.
- Look,I really don't have time for this.

376
00:30:57,729 --> 00:31:00,259
Yes,you do.I.D.,Please.

377
00:31:06,689 --> 00:31:09,339
Out of the truck!Out of the truck!Get out here!

378
00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:13,749
All right,all right!Don't hurt me!

379
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:15,849
Just...Don't hurt me.

380
00:31:28,029 --> 00:31:30,539
Oh,no way.

381
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:46,029
Please.I just--

382
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:45,669
No!No.

383
00:34:00,379 --> 00:34:03,199
Not fair.

384
00:34:16,504 --> 00:34:19,084
I don't--I didn't do anything.

385
00:34:24,014 --> 00:34:27,074
Everything's good.It's good.It's good.He's good.

386
00:34:28,794 --> 00:34:30,834
He's terrified.

387
00:34:31,374 --> 00:34:33,834
- Of us?
- Of the unsub.

388
00:34:37,384 --> 00:34:39,904
Garcia couldn't find much on this guy at all.

389
00:34:39,914 --> 00:34:43,524
No employment records,no tax records,
no credit cards,no bank accounts.

390
00:34:44,234 --> 00:34:47,614
The van is registered to a paper corporation 
out of the cayman islands.

391
00:34:47,624 --> 00:34:51,654
Other than having a valid driver's license,
steven foster has no paper trail.

392
00:34:51,664 --> 00:34:55,004
My guess is he's devoted his entire 
life to helping the unsub.

393
00:34:55,504 --> 00:34:58,664
Unsub takes care of everything for him.

394
00:34:58,674 --> 00:35:02,124
In return,steven provides fresh victims.

395
00:35:02,774 --> 00:35:04,874
So how do you know there's another guy?

396
00:35:04,884 --> 00:35:08,094
Does he look like he could cleanly
 pull off 63 murders?

397
00:35:08,104 --> 00:35:11,954
So if he's his accomplice,
why is he so afraid of the guy?

398
00:35:11,964 --> 00:35:15,444
Steven's the only person in the world
 truly aware of what the unsub is capable of.

399
00:35:15,904 --> 00:35:18,734
The only one still alive.

400
00:35:29,914 --> 00:35:33,944
Sadism and torture invariably get worse 
with every victim.

401
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:37,944
That's why this was so important.
We couldn't take the chance that it wasn't happening.

402
00:35:40,534 --> 00:35:43,374
- That's him? 
- He's not the unsub.

403
00:35:43,784 --> 00:35:47,654
- Well,then-- then who is he?
- Only relationship the unsub has left in the world.

404
00:35:47,664 --> 00:35:48,734
His only friend.

405
00:35:48,744 --> 00:35:51,694
Did you want me to publicize the arrest,
put some pressure on the unsub?

406
00:35:51,704 --> 00:35:53,174
No.He might run.

407
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:56,284
Ok,so,uh,how we gonna find him,then?

408
00:35:56,294 --> 00:35:59,004
Steven's gonna tell us where he is.

409
00:36:25,304 --> 00:36:27,034
Well,finally!

410
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:30,364
You took your damn time,didn't you?

411
00:36:32,844 --> 00:36:36,434
What the hell am i doin' here,anyways?
I didn't do nothin'.

412
00:36:37,644 --> 00:36:40,514
I mean,what's the charges?
Do you even have any?

413
00:36:41,254 --> 00:36:43,974
What did I do,offer to help an old lady
 get a--get to a park?

414
00:36:43,984 --> 00:36:47,694
Is that even illegal?I don't think so.

415
00:36:47,704 --> 00:36:53,564
Should be getting some kind of award instead of
 sitting in here waiting for you to decide to talk to me.

416
00:36:54,064 --> 00:36:55,784
I know you're gonna...

417
00:36:55,794 --> 00:36:59,034
Charge me with that wreck,right,
crashing into that car?

418
00:36:59,044 --> 00:37:02,884
That was the other cop's fault,the black guy?

419
00:37:05,154 --> 00:37:09,314
He jumped into my van.
He caused me to-- it was his fault.

420
00:37:10,804 --> 00:37:15,424
It-- it wasn't me.
It was-- there were witnesses,you know.

421
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:17,894
Sit down.

422
00:37:24,234 --> 00:37:28,434
I've been standing on the other side of that
 glass thinking about what to do with you,steven.

423
00:37:29,654 --> 00:37:32,724
And this morning I decided to save your life.

424
00:37:32,734 --> 00:37:35,374
You're gonna tell me where my killer is.

425
00:37:35,384 --> 00:37:40,224
You're gonna give me an address,and you're gonna 
tell me how to get inside without raising an alarm.

426
00:37:40,234 --> 00:37:43,424
You're gonna draw me a map if I need one.

427
00:37:43,434 --> 00:37:46,964
And you're gonna do this 
because he's never been nice to you.

428
00:37:47,934 --> 00:37:51,244
He constantly insults you and belittles you.

429
00:37:51,254 --> 00:37:56,554
He emasculates you and makes you feel ugly 
and stupid and worthless.

430
00:37:56,564 --> 00:37:58,834
Nothing you ever do is right.

431
00:37:58,844 --> 00:38:01,714
Never good enough.

432
00:38:03,454 --> 00:38:05,854
You hate him,steven.

433
00:38:07,234 --> 00:38:11,184
And you're also going to tell me 
because you know you screwed up last night.

434
00:38:11,774 --> 00:38:16,064
He told you that your paramount concern was
 not to attract the attention of the authorities

435
00:38:16,074 --> 00:38:19,524
and you know the punishment will be severe.

436
00:38:19,934 --> 00:38:24,244
Nobody knows better than you 
what he can do to people.

437
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:29,524
I've spent a long time studying monsters
 like your friend,and I can promise you...

438
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:34,284
He's gonna do things to you 
that even you can't imagine.

439
00:38:39,554 --> 00:38:42,224
I can't.

440
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:48,844
My family's always worked for his family.
It's all I know.

441
00:38:50,894 --> 00:38:55,104
His father died last year and left everything
 to him,all the money,all the...

442
00:38:56,654 --> 00:38:59,324
He--he's the last one.

443
00:39:01,724 --> 00:39:05,724
He--he changed after.He's different.

444
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:10,754
He'S...Meaner.

445
00:39:16,094 --> 00:39:19,044
He's gonna hurt me so bad.

446
00:39:19,054 --> 00:39:21,434
Not if we lock him up.

447
00:39:23,114 --> 00:39:26,714
Not if you tell us how we can put him away.

448
00:39:30,754 --> 00:39:32,644
Holcombe.

449
00:39:34,534 --> 00:39:37,544
His--his name is charles holcombe.

450
00:39:39,934 --> 00:39:43,184
He owns the old meatpacking plant.

451
00:40:03,904 --> 00:40:07,944
Are you gonna hide your face from me?Coward.

452
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:11,284
That old man was begging.

453
00:40:11,294 --> 00:40:14,594
I'm not gonna give you that,you son of a bitch.

454
00:40:14,974 --> 00:40:18,784
I'm not gonna beg you for anything.

455
00:40:30,284 --> 00:40:32,814
But you will beg,whore.

456
00:40:33,184 --> 00:40:35,344
They all do.

457
00:40:35,354 --> 00:40:37,754
- Charles holcombe!
- FBI

458
00:40:39,614 --> 00:40:42,524
- Don't do it.
- Let me do my job!

459
00:40:49,374 --> 00:40:52,344
It's ok,It's ok.look at me

460
00:40:52,354 --> 00:40:54,894
You're all right.It's over.

461
00:40:57,884 --> 00:41:00,834
- The face.
- You've got some cuts,but you're gonna be ok.

462
00:41:00,844 --> 00:41:05,484
No.I want to see his face.

463
00:41:06,754 --> 00:41:09,064
Morgan.

464
00:41:18,164 --> 00:41:20,984
I won.

465
00:41:24,964 --> 00:41:27,014
There's an ambulance outside.

466
00:41:27,024 --> 00:41:30,094
Can you have someone check on my baby?

467
00:41:30,104 --> 00:41:34,664
My mom's baby-sitting her,and--
and I didn't get home last night.

468
00:41:34,674 --> 00:41:38,164
- We'll take care of it.
- Thank you.

469
00:42:36,644 --> 00:42:41,794
Nothing is permanent in this wicked world,
not even our troubles.

470
00:42:43,484 --> 00:42:45,854
Charles chaplin.
