Rtraffic's looking pretty good this
afternoon for your evening commute.

00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,790
This is john brown with
your kmpa traffic report.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,980
Stay tuned for southland
sports,coming up after this.

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,480
Can't be late for my own party, norman.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,570
I gotta go. You're gonna
have to meet me there.

6
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:20,640
Ok.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,050
You're not gonna wear that tie, are you?

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,120
Not one of my favorites.

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,990
Don't forget to put the seat down.

10
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,880
Jeez,lady!

11
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,190
- Excuse me,miss?
- Yes?

12
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,410
Excuse me.

13
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,020
Oh,wait. Hold on one second.

14
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,460
All right,i'm back.

15
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,810
No,go on. And as i was saying...

16
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,630
The principal's office
called. Yeah--plagiarism.

17
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,180
Yeah,well,i was in the middle of
closing on the ocean park 5-bedroom...

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,180
And i'm telling you, if i lose that commission,
it is coming out of his college fund.

H.l.mencken.

42
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,700
This is orange county, california.

43
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,750
10 days ago,judy hannity, a
real estate broker and a mother,

44
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,040
Was shotgunned on the 91 freeway.

45
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,360
- She survived this?
- Barely.

46
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,360
She's paralyzed from the waist down.

47
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,850
The second and third
victims were both d.o.a.

48
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,960
There were different
vehicles for each shooting.

49
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,890
A small black suv, a black sedan,a
white sedan, no makes,no plates.

50
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:27,920
No solid witnesses?

51
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,430
The first victim described the shooter as
a normal,middle-aged white guy in an suv.

52
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,810
She gave that description but
she couldn't rember anything else?

53
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,580
Isn't that consistent with trauma?

54
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,250
Uh,actually,no.

55
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,570
Trauma victims either
remember everything or nothing.

56
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,960
So wait--the third victim was shot last
week, we just got the phone call today?

57
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,380
Until the third shooting, the locals
weren't convinced it was a serial shooter.

58
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,330
There were different cars, and the first
shooting there was a different weapon.

59
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,110
It's the same weapon.

60
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:56,400
The shot pattern on the second and
third one are much wider,though.

61
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,070
He sawed off the shotgun.
It's the same shooter.

62
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,080
He's evolving,and quickly.

63
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,530
The media has already
dubbed him the road warrior.

64
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,520
That explains why they
wanted us there so quickly.

65
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,280
What do you mean?

66
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,150
This type of unsub is
the hardest to catch.

67
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,100
Totally impersonal victims.

68
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,950
A third of the crime scene
flees with him and his vehicle.

69
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,110
The victim's car's a wreck.

70
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,970
And the last third, the road, it's contaminated
by all the other cars that drive over it.

71
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,090
So how do we get him?

72
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,650
We build a solid profile.

73
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,840
We release it to the public
with an appeal for help.

74
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,100
Somebody knows this guy.

75
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,010
And it's my job to make them realize.

76
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,770
<i>Sheriff's.....</i>

77
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,230
Thea salinas, sheriff's county homicide.

78
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,450
I'm running the taskforce.

79
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:42,720
I'm special agent jordan todd, special
agents rossi, hotchner, prentiss...

80
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,430
Morgan... And that's dr. Spencer reid.

81
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,110
- Are these the vehicles from the shootings?
- Yes.

82
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,640
Did you set up the hotline?

83
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,500
Like you asked.

84
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,530
We have the local stations
putting the number out there.

85
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,260
We're getting about
a dozen calls an hour.

86
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,180
I'll alert the media to stand by
for our press conference. Excuse me.

87
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,950
The sheriff's department
and the chp are on tac alert.

88
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,730
We've got choppers on
round-the-clock freeway patrol.

89
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,360
The victims' vehicles,with
maps,csps,and bullet points.

90
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,210
Everything we got on
the case is in this room.

91
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,730
Anything solid on the tip line?

92
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:14,300
Usual nutjobs, crime buffs,
bored senior citizens.

93
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,170
You might have got
everything squared away.

94
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,270
It's not me. It's the shooter.

95
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,650
The o.c.has an endless
supply of 3 things--

96
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:25,240
Freeways,news coverage, and
blond female luxury car owners.

97
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,800
People are pretty scared?

98
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,740
I could ask for a submarine and get it.

99
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,750
The first m.o.in the first shooting
differs dramatically from the other two.

100
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,340
Daylight on a crowded freeway.

101
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,460
That's dozens of potential witnesses.

102
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,700
It's high-risk. He got lucky.

103
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,890
Well,then, he's a fast study.

104
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,350
Sawed off his shotgun and lowered his risk
by switching to nights and changing vehicles.

105
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,410
What if he wasn't planning
on murder the first time?

106
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,040
You think the first
shooting was spontaneous?

107
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,870
Well,we know what he's
capable of when he plans ahead.

108
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,560
If i'm not planning to commit a
crime, why not drive my own vehicle?

109
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,860
So the suv is his actual car.

110
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,850
But then,why did he have a gun in the suv
if he wasn't planning to commit murder?

111
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,280
And what happened to make
him pull that first trigger?

112
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,300
We need to re-interview
the first victim.

113
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,610
Ms.hannity, i'm agent aaron hotchner.

114
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,630
This is agent emily
prentiss. We're from the fbi.

115
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,880
She already told the police
everything she can remember.

116
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,640
Rick... It's ok.

117
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,470
Please.

118
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,760
It's just the two of us.

119
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,420
He feels like it's
his job to protect me.

120
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,380
I understand you've
spoken to the police.

121
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,720
I just need to go back
through the shooting with you.

122
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,340
It only comes back in pieces.

123
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,960
We can take it slowly.

124
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,220
Just try to piece together
your day,if you can.

125
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,860
Have you seen accidents
like this before?

126
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,040
A few.

127
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,730
Do people recover?

128
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,730
The doctor said she has a good chance.

129
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,220
- It's my fault.
- No.

130
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,680
This is no one's fault but
the man who shot your mother.

131
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,920
I got in trouble at school.
She was on her way there.

132
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,210
She shouldn't have even been in her car.

133
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,360
So you were angry?

134
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,430
I don't know. I suppose.

135
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:34,530
I know this is difficult, but every
detail helps us understand who this man is.

136
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,920
Come on. Come on,move!

137
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,300
I was impatient.

138
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,180
And you cut him off?

139
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,790
Was there anything else?
Did he swear? Did he honk?

140
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,710
Did he threaten you in any way?

141
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,270
Excuse me.

142
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,920
Oh,wait. Hold on one second.

143
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,360
He tried to speak to me.

144
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,540
What did he say?

145
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,800
He couldn't say anything.

146
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:22,200
I wouldn't give him a chance.

147
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,560
What? Now you want to talk about
your feelings like you're some chick?

148
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,000
You drive like an old lady.

149
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,890
All right,i'm back.

150
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,390
No,go on. And as i was saying...

151
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,280
If he hadn't seemed so normal...

152
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,420
I wouldn't have said anything.

153
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,310
I...

154
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:59,530
I usually don't even use my
horn, because on the road...

155
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,980
You never know.

156
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,330
I'll ask your son to come back in.

157
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,700
Is she ok?

158
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,620
She says you've been taking
very good care of her.

159
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,880
I guess so.

160
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,380
She's lucky to have you.

161
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,010
So... What happened?

162
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,950
She made it personal.

163
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:42,860
When the victimology's this specific, we know
the victims represent a specific person to him.

164
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,580
Who?

165
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,490
Given the fact that he's the
same age and race as the victims,

166
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:49,310
Likely a current or
former wife or girlfriend.

167
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,070
So why not just kill the actual person?

168
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,360
She's just a scapegoat for
his own personal failings.

169
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,430
He knows if he kills her,
he loses that scapegoat.

170
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,030
So he just goes around
blowing away any women?

171
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,350
No,just women that
remind him of his wife.

172
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,350
When this type of killer is triggered,
they need to release the resentment quickly.

173
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,410
Subsequently,they tend to strike
close to the focus of that resentment.

174
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:13,580
So if the focus is his wife,
then that focus is his home.

175
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,490
Yeah. He almost certainly
lives in this area.

176
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,220
This is his kill zone.

177
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,180
Uh,what are these various
markers everywhere?

178
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,670
Uh,roadwork.

179
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:32,060
Judith hannity said that he shot her
after she challenged him personally.

180
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,320
Before that, he was almost apologetic.

181
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,740
What's going on?

182
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,040
Out of the 30 roadwork sites in the
kill zone, only 2 were alternate merges,

183
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,210
Both less than 3 miles
from the crime scenes.

184
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,160
Alternate merges?

185
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,500
Multiple lanes funneled down to one.

186
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,770
One car per lane, alternating
at the drivers' discretion.

187
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:48,240
These sites allow him to
set up the confrontation.

188
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,580
A guy who follows the
rules may lash out once,

189
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,940
but to do it again, he'd
need similar provocation.

190
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,110
So he seeks out alternate merge sites, then
he goes through them over and over again

191
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:59,530
Until he finds a woman that fits
his victim type and who cuts him off.

192
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:02,730
So,we have to shut down every alternate
merge in the county immediately.

193
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,800
And we need to talk to the
crews that work these sites.

194
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,650
So what does all this tell you?

195
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,530
Impersonal killers
are like drug addicts.

196
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:12,450
The first time gives them the ultimate
high, and after that, no high is as good.

197
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:15,410
Unfortunately,the
addict doesn't know that.

198
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:19,530
He will chase that high to the
gates of insanity and death.

199
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:24,540
By now,killing is all
our unsub things about.

200
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,860
He's set up the exact same situation again
and again, hoping to get the same result.

201
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:38,420
He begins to think he's doing it wrong.

202
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:44,030
He becomes obsessed with improving
his skills, honing his m.o.

203
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,270
And tailoring his weapon
to his deadly purpose.

204
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,850
He figures if he gets
them all just right,

205
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,520
if he can get his technique
and his tools perfected,

206
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,810
He'll feel that first high again.

207
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,640
He's becoming a more lethal addict.

208
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,050
And he'll never accept that the
high is gone and it won't come back.

209
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,740
He'll never stop. Never.

210
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,140
You know how many cars i see
drive through my work site here?

211
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,830
Your boss said you were the
safety officer that night?

212
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,380
So?

213
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,300
So that means you would have been
holding the sign to slow cars down.

214
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:33,110
We're looking for a man in a white sedan, and
he would have come through over and over again.

215
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:38,540
The driver would have been going extra slow,
like he was daring anyone to cut him off.

216
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,140
Son of a bitch.

217
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,130
You remember someone?

218
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,320
Yeah. I thought the guy was lost.

219
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,360
I mean, i even talked to tony about
this guy dressing like a hard-ass,

220
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,870
but he drove like a chick.

221
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,320
- No offense.
- None taken.

222
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,100
What do you mean,
dressed like a hard-ass?

223
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,320
This jackass was wearing a leather
jacket, he's got sunglasses on,

224
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,440
They're mirrored, you
know, like the cops use.

225
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,810
But it was dark out.

226
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,080
He's starting to role-play.
He's breaking from reality.

227
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,090
Do you remember anything
else about this man?

228
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:05,720
A car cut him off, and he stuck
his arm out across the front seat.

229
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,410
But after that i didn't
see him come through again.

230
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,500
Show me what he did with his arm.

231
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,590
Like this.

232
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,140
Like he was keeping a passenger
from hitting the dashboard?

233
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,540
Yeah,but the dude was alone.

234
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:18,620
- Thanks for your time.
- Sure.

235
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,250
What's wrong?

236
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,150
A small suv is a family vehicle.

237
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:26,360
Between that and the hand gesture, i'm
afraid that our unsub's married with children.

238
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,680
Why does that matter?

239
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,970
Well,if he's breaking from reality and
he's lashing out at surrogates for his life,

240
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,540
Then it's only a matter of time before
he tries to wipe out the real thing.

241
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,490
Are you saying this guy's
gonna kill his wife and kids?

242
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:39,520
Call your people.

243
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,120
We need to get a profile
out as soon as possible.

244
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:49,200
The hyper-masculine
disguise, victim preference,

245
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,270
And the emasculating
trigger of the first attack

246
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:54,600
All tell us this is an unsub
suffering a masculine identity crisis.

247
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,430
A masculine identity crisis?

248
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,600
That's why he's driving
around blowing women away?

249
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,030
No. Judy hannity was just the trigger.

250
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,630
We need to identify the
precipitating trauma.

251
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,080
Something happened in the unsub's
life, something so traumatic,

252
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,430
It turned a normal man
into a serial killer.

253
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,510
So he's suffering from some
kind of psychotic break.

254
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:15,000
Which means the world he sees around him
has changed,and so has his role in it.

255
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,510
And that of his family.

256
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:20,340
His perception of his home life
is the key to his pathology.

257
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,880
At home this unsub feels less than a man,
a failure as a father and as a husband.

258
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,970
He feels his children
don't need or respect him.

259
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:51,310
And that he's unwanted and
obsolete in their lives.

260
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,150
As a husband he feels emasculated
and humiliated by his wife.

261
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,050
Yeah,right, that'd be good.

262
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,840
Now,these beliefs and
perceptions, real or imagined,

263
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,570
Have destroyed this individual's
masculine self-image.

264
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,460
This unsub is delusional.

265
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,480
He's now dressing in
this road warrior persona.

266
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,060
It gives him feelings of power
and purpose that he craves.

267
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,570
It is now the single most
important thing in his life.

268
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,880
And he will die before giving it up.

269
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,060
His new fantasy persona can't co-exist
with the everyday reality of his home life.

270
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,060
Which means sooner or later he's
going to kill his entire family.

271
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,150
So what do we do?

272
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,400
Our strategy's three-fold.

273
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,120
First we find every small-model blue
suv owner in the estimated kill zone.

274
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,170
2--we set up a single alternate merge scenario
in that zone, and we man it with our people.

275
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,710
And 3--we release our
profile to the public.

276
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:44,570
Somebody out there knows this
man. They just don't realize it.

277
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,470
Hey,norman.

278
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,980
Can you put this on my account?

279
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,520
I'll need mr. Manning's approval.

280
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,930
Whenever you get around to it.

281
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,930
I'm still waiting for last
month's expense summary,norman.

282
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,170
I'm sorry.

283
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,390
The guys on the sixth floor
are asking for my quarterly.

284
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,630
I need that summary.

285
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,550
I got--i know i got--
i got it here somewhere.

286
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:31,980
You're an old,bald loser
and everyone laughs at you.

287
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,210
What did you say?

288
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,810
I didn't say anything.

289
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,990
Look,norman, the sixth floor doesn't
care what's going on in your life

290
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,210
or how long you've been with the firm.

291
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,780
They're all about the numbers,

292
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:50,820
and the numbers tell them that younger
workers cost less and produce more.

293
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,010
I like you,norman.

294
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,770
I know how hard things have been
for you these past few months.

295
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,920
Don't give those bastards on the sixth
floor an excuse, you know what i mean?

296
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,790
Yeah. Yeah.

297
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,410
Here it is.

298
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,670
Thanks.

299
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,670
We ask the public to listen very
carefully to the following description.

300
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:21,930
Anyone who believes they recognize this
individual should call our tip line immediately.

301
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:26,060
We are looking for a white,
middle-aged,married father.

302
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:30,090
We believe his wife is blond,
approximately 40 years old,

303
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:33,470
Resembles the victims,
and drives a luxury sedan.

304
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:37,500
This individual drives
a blue small-model suv

305
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,530
and most likely lives in this area.

306
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:44,270
It is also very possible this
individual recently suffered

307
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:47,020
a personal trauma in his life.

308
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:51,770
All points bulletin: be on the lookout
for a worthless loser named norman,

309
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:57,830
Who resents anyone with a life and kills
just to prove he's not an emasculated loser.

310
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:13,560
It's very possible this individual has
suffered a personal trauma in his life.

311
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,870
Again,a white,middle-aged,
married father.

312
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,880
We believe his wife is
blond,approximately 40 years old,

313
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,720
Resembles the victims, and
drives a luxury sedan. This...

314
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,510
They do it to me, they do it to me,
they do it to me, they do it to me!

315
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:33,060
Why do they always do that to me?

316
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,050
Makes you... Damn...

317
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,200
Hey,buddy. Are you all right?

318
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,210
Joe karem and timothy calvert.

319
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,230
D.o.a.no wants,no warrants.

320
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,290
They work in the area, and detectives
are notifying their families.

321
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:26,880
Sawed-off 12-gauge, close range, shot out of the
driver's side window, driving a small blue suv.

322
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,760
That's our guy, but
he went way off script.

323
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,730
Multiple male victims, surface street,
daytime attack, and he drove his own vehicle.

324
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,630
Something triggered
him and pissed him off.

325
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,630
What time did this happen?

326
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,910
Approximately 2:20.

327
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:40,810
Single witness says the shooter
was driving a small blue suv.

328
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:41,950
Didn't get a plate.

329
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,750
Middle-aged white guy, wearing a tie.

330
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,480
Suit jacket hanging in the back.

331
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,590
- Press conference?
- 2:20.

332
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,140
Jordan went on the air at
2:00. He was watching the news.

333
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,080
You said the unsub was going
to be watching the coverage.

334
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,980
20 minutes from wherever he was watching
the press conference to this intersection.

335
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:00,160
He drives the speed limit, taking into
account red lights and mid-day traffic...

336
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,510
No more than 10 miles.

337
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,330
So he lives within 10 miles of here?

338
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,940
- I don't think so.
- I don't understand.

339
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,120
We were wrong.

340
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,200
He was wearing a tie, suit
jacket hanging in the back.

341
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,150
And considering the time of day...

342
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,980
He works in the area.

343
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,480
I'm gonna call garcia.

344
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,350
Give it to me.

345
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:21,050
Hey,baby. Can you pull up a map
of the crime scene area for me?

346
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:24,630
Sugar,i could shut down the power grid
to the whole city if you told me to.

347
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,330
Yeah,i'm sure you can.

348
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,340
Right now i just need you to highlight
a 10-mile radius around this point.

349
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,930
Track any calls coming in
from this area to the tip line.

350
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,340
Coordinate with prentiss
and reid,would you?

351
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,280
I'm all over it. Mwah.

352
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,380
Thanks,baby girl.

353
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,210
You think he's gonna
kill again soon,don't you?

354
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,890
And he's done killing surrogates.

355
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,740
Did you know?

356
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,210
Excuse me. This is not
the time or the place.

357
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,550
You gonna do this in front of the press?

358
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:48,490
He killed those people
because of something i said.

359
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:51,460
No. Whenwetalk to the public,
it's always a possibility.

360
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:54,710
That is part of the job. Tell
me now if you can do it or not.

361
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:57,290
Damn right. I can do the shop.

362
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:00,350
Good. You're about to give
another press conference.

363
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:04,640
We're on the air in 3,2,1...

364
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,970
We are prepared to release to
the public additional information

365
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:12,220
About the individual responsible
for the freeway shooting.

366
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:18,360
The individual is a white, 45- to
55-year-old male of average build.

367
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,470
He works in this area.

368
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:26,730
He wears a suit and tie to work and left
work very abruptly shortly after 2:00,

369
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:31,070
immediately after watching our
earlier statement about him.

370
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:36,100
If anyone has any additional information,
please call our anonymous tip line immediately.

371
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,050
Thank you.

372
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,390
One last thing.

373
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:44,970
This individual has committed horrible
crimes and must be held to account,

374
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:48,580
but he is a husband and a father.

375
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,670
He's violent and he's troubled,

376
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:54,880
but he must be capable of some
degree of mercy and compassion.

377
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,140
And so... We appeal to him...

378
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,870
Do not hurt any more people.

379
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:06,680
Please turn yourself in.

380
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,090
Norman? Is something wrong?

381
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,580
I'm the road warrior.

382
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,950
What?

383
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,780
I'm the road warrior,
the freeway shooter.

384
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,390
I thought i should tell you.

385
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,020
Of course you are,dear.

386
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,730
And i'm the zodiac killer.

387
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:44,070
We should compare notes at dinner.

388
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,250
What's so funny?

389
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:58,920
Dad confessed. He's the road warrior.

390
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,660
You're such a dork.

391
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,490
Yeah.

392
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,430
What is the exact address?

393
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,410
What do we got?

394
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:16,110
You have no idea how many middle-aged
white men there are out there

395
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,350
Who have someone close to them
that think they're a serial killer.

396
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:21,120
And you said that he saw
the press conference,right?

397
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,770
Ok,thank you.

398
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,770
Guys,i think we might have something.

399
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:29,650
That's funny,when i heard the description in
the first press conference, i thought of norman.

400
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:32,690
Then i just thought,
it couldn't be,you know?

401
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:33,870
He's so quiet.

402
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,810
What is it that mr. Hill does for you?

403
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,960
He's in charge of the company's
travel expenses. This is his desk.

404
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,600
Does he have access to the company cars?

405
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,680
Yeah,the whole fleet.

406
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,840
What about the first press
conference made you think of norman?

407
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,870
The woman mentioned something
about him suffering a tragedy.

408
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,060
Daddy, what's taking so long?

409
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,910
Daddy will be done in a minute.
Just stay in the car,baby.

410
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,450
I want to help.

411
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,840
Jenny,get back in the car!
Get back in the car! No!

412
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,430
How long ago did his daughter die?

413
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,820
6 months.

414
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,180
I really should have
done more to help him.

415
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,140
Thank you.

416
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,000
Norman's personnel file.

417
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,410
This address current?

418
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:21,950
It should be.

419
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,360
Why does he have 2 files?

420
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,910
Uh,we cross-reference married couples.

421
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,090
I don't understand.

422
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:30,230
Norman's wife vanessa works here,too.

423
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,560
We need to speak to her.

424
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,920
Uh,she's not here.

425
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:38,400
She just got a promotion, so
she took a couple of weeks off.

426
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,140
Get in the car.

427
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,150
- I just got home from school.
- Don't talk back to me!

428
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,170
Norman,what's going on?

429
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:50,020
You'll see. Everybody,now. I'm driving.

430
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,510
Norman,what are you doing?

431
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,710
- Norman,slow down!
- No!

432
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,410
What do you mean,no?

433
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:08,240
We have to get out of here.

434
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,920
Dad,let us out of the car!

435
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,890
Damn it.

436
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,050
- Please.
- Ok,norman, the police are behind us.

437
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,560
- Shut up!
- Shut up?

438
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,600
- The police should stay out of this.
- Stay out of it?

439
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,960
You ran a stop sign and you're
going like 100 miles an hour.

440
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,840
- This is family business!
- Family?

441
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,830
- You have to stop this.
- No.

442
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,920
What we have to do is we
have to get out of here.

443
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,620
Please,dad,this is crazy!

444
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,990
Norman,stop this car right now!

445
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:57,530
Shut up! All of you shut up!

446
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:03,890
Salinas. Where?

447
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:06,870
We have a chase. Small model suv,blue.

448
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:09,500
Driving recklessly. 117th and pacific.

449
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:14,010
Morgan,we have a high-speed chase, 117
and pacific. It sounds like our guy.

450
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,050
All right,listen, we're closer
to 117, so we're on our way now.

451
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,220
We'll head over to the hill house.

452
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,090
If he's having a break, he could
be on his way there to finish it.

453
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,580
- We're on our way. Be careful.
- Ok.

454
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:29,480
Norman,please stop.

455
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,670
We should have done
this a long time ago.

456
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,730
Done what?

457
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:35,570
We can't move on living in
that house. I can't do it.

458
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,240
- Move on?
- I don't know how you could.

459
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:42,450
How you could-- you keep looking
at those same walls, the same...

460
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,710
The same pictures.

461
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,280
Norman,what are you talking about?

462
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,600
It's my job to make
everything right again.

463
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,400
- Turn right here.
- Where,here?

464
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,610
Right--right-- turn right
here! Turn right here!

465
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,420
I'm gonna need a little
more notice than that,kid.

466
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,750
Sorry. Sorry.

467
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:12,140
Norman,please just tell
me what's happening.

468
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,340
Why are you doing this?

469
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:16,260
Because i know that you blame me.

470
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,250
Blame you?

471
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:20,210
I see the way you all
look at me. I see it.

472
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,760
- All right,left.
- Where?

473
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,930
Uh,next light.

474
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,920
Norman,please,just stop.

475
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,740
Oh,my god. Where did you get that?

476
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,480
I tried to tell you,
but you wouldn't listen.

477
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,530
You just wouldn't listen!

478
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:31,240
Repeat,shots fired! On the chase now.

479
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,440
He's losin' it.

480
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,240
Reid,does it look like the chase
could be headed to his house?

481
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,040
Uh,yeah,i think so.

482
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,050
It almost looks like he's starting to go
in a wide circle toward that direction.

483
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,990
Ok,emily, we're right outside it now.

484
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:02,270
All units, pursuit now
headed over memorial bridge.

485
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:05,050
We're almost there. Turn
right at the next light.

486
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:12,260
Norman,where did you get that gun?

487
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:15,300
- How could you forget her so fast?
- What?

488
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:18,190
- You think i forgot?
- You moved on!

489
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,660
I cry every day!

490
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:23,530
Don't lie to me! Don't lie to me!

491
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,310
Memorial bridge is
around the next corner.

492
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:34,200
Hold on! Hold on!

493
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:47,090
- You good!
- We're good,go,go!

494
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,590
Vanessa hill! Fbi!

495
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,530
Are you inside?

496
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:02,150
Maybe they went somewhere safe.

497
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,600
Let's check around back.

498
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,280
We can never be a family
again in that house.

499
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,530
We can never be a family anywhere!

500
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,450
No. No,don't say that.

501
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:20,690
- You let her die,daddy!
- No,no,no, it wasn't my fault.

502
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:22,190
Of course it was your fault!

503
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:24,290
Please don't say it!
Just stop saying that!

504
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,420
I wasn't there. Sasha wasn't there.

505
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,610
You had her and you let her die!

506
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:31,960
Just shut up! Just shut up!

507
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,180
A '63 astin martin db-5.

508
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:50,040
James bond. Goldfinger.

509
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,030
Guys.

510
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,930
Reid,get on the radio and
tell them we're in the chase.

511
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,590
This is the fbi
behavioral analysis unit.

512
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,060
We caught up to the chase
and are now monitoring.

513
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,670
We ask if you're able
to stop the vehicle,

514
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,480
You allow us to take the
lead in contacting the driver.

515
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,420
We believe him to be a
severely deranged suspect.

516
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,360
Copy.

517
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,300
Let's split up.

518
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,450
It was your fault.

519
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:54,440
I'm sorry.

520
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,520
You let my baby girl die.

521
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,570
And you think i forgot?!

522
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:46,330
It was your fault.

523
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:51,860
No. No,no,no, no,no!

524
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,540
Norman!

525
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,490
What are you doing? What are you doing?

526
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,310
- Don't move!
- My family's inside!

527
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:24,540
- Stop and listen to me!
Listen to me! - No,my family's--

528
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,210
- nobody is in that car.
- Nobody...

529
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,660
- Your family's gone,norman.
- No,they're in there.

530
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,540
They're gone,norman!

531
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:35,120
Look inside. Look in
the car. Look in the car.

532
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,950
They were never there.

533
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:42,220
It's over.

534
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,740
They were never with you.

535
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,640
No,but they were. They were...

536
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,190
Your family's gone,norman.

537
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,090
Oh,god,what did i do?

538
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:40,180
Oh,what did i do to my family?

539
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,560
My family! I'm sorry.

540
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,950
I'm sorry! My family...

541
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,470
It's over,norman.

542
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:54,790
We're gonna get you some help.
It's over. Let's go. Get up.

543
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,350
Jordan?

544
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,130
Did i do that?

545
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:19,400
Is this my fault?

546
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,430
No,kiddo. No way.

547
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,550
They were gone before
we even got the case.

548
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,730
We knew he would hurt his family.

549
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:31,220
We just didn't know that he already had.

550
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:36,270
I don't...

551
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,890
I'm not sure i can do this job.

552
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,720
That's ok.

553
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,280
There's nothing wrong with that.

554
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,130
"there's no tragedy in life
"like the death of a child.

555
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:06,290
Things never get back
to the way they were."

556
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:09,450
President dwight eisenhower.

557
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,500
You all right?

558
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,770
I will be.

559
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:21,750
Hey,you guys ever notice how the trip
home always seems to go so much faster?

560
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,300
That's because the
tailwinds are in our favor.

561
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,850
No,i meant 'cause-- anybody
want to get something to eat?

562
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:27,390
- Not really.
- You?

563
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,720
No,not really.

564
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,770
There's someone in the b.a.u.room,guys.

565
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:38,620
- What are you doing here?
- JJ.

566
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:41,710
Garcia said you guys were
on your way back tonight.

567
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:44,470
I thought you could use a surprise.

568
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,910
I thought i gave you strict orders to get
this place out of your head for a while.

569
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,750
My bad. I couldn't help myself.

570
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:55,710
Here. I heated it up. Room temp. Right?

571
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:02,630
I just realized, with all that we do
and see in this room, it never smiles.

572
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:05,700
I wanted at least one
good memory to hold on to.

573
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,980
Excuse me,kid.

574
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:12,310
Um,jj,uh... Can i?

575
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,310
Of course.

576
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,620
Ok,you gotta hold his
head up. Careful,careful.

577
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:21,660
- I got it,i got it.I got it.
- No,you don't got it. You're smothering him.

578
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,910
Look,what's he doing? What's he doing?

579
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:26,790
He is smiling at derek morgan.

580
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,180
- Gas.
- Gas.

581
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:32,080
Give me that.

582
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,910
Hey,little man.

583
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:42,300
You're smiling.

584
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,800
Yes.

585
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,350
