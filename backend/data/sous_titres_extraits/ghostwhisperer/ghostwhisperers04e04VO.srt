00:00:11,677 --> 00:00:13,522
???

3
00:00:13,522 --> 00:00:14,754
????

4
00:00:14,754 --> 00:00:15,707
??

5
00:00:15,707 --> 00:00:16,879
what ???

6
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:18,296
i ???

7
00:00:18,296 --> 00:00:21,222
?

8
00:00:21,573 --> 00:00:24,054
hey, can you please stop talking and smile?

9
00:00:24,054 --> 00:00:25,153
oh sorry

10
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:27,579
huh,???

11
00:00:27,855 --> 00:00:29,822
?

12
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:31,700
oh??

13
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,533
to pick up some really
great pieces for the shop.

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,228
it's kind of sad

15
00:00:35,228 --> 00:00:36,633
that they're
just gonna scrap

16
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,934
this gigantic
thing.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,886
yeah, but first they're
gonna auction off everything.

18
00:00:39,886 --> 00:00:42,067
promise me you
won't go overboard.

19
00:00:42,134 --> 00:00:43,067
yes, yes.

20
00:00:43,134 --> 00:00:44,866
i know when
to stop bidding. shush.

21
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:46,400
no, for once,
i'm being literal.

22
00:00:46,467 --> 00:00:47,467
i'm talking
about that woman

23
00:00:47,533 --> 00:00:49,544
who jumped off
this ship last week.

24
00:00:50,034 --> 00:00:52,167
don't you guys
watch the news?

25
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:54,725
yeah. all they found were
her shoes by the railing.

26
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:56,344
people do that
apparently.

27
00:00:56,344 --> 00:00:58,233
they just take off their
shoes before they jump.

28
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,600
oh, you're not just
being literal.

29
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:00,867
you're being kind of weird,

30
00:01:00,934 --> 00:01:02,533
and no one
is going overboard.

31
00:01:03,137 --> 00:01:04,167
all aboard!

32
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:05,167
ooh. ok.

33
00:01:05,408 --> 00:01:07,208
don't forget
they're coming saturday

34
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:08,925
to deliver the new
fridge for the garage.

35
00:01:08,925 --> 00:01:10,233
i got it. go.
have fun.

36
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,333
bye, d.
bye.

37
00:01:11,802 --> 00:01:13,949
haven't told her
we're trying to get pregnant?

38
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,318
i don't want to make
an announcement

39
00:01:15,318 --> 00:01:16,607
until there's
something to announce.

40
00:01:16,607 --> 00:01:18,333
but you know, 3 days,
the open sea,

41
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,934
with nothing else to do.

42
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,134
no auction preview?

43
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,734
every now and then, you
have to take a break.

44
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,967
oh, do you?

45
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,012
ohh.

46
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,853
did your ghost-dar
go ping?

47
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:40,088
there may be one or...

48
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:43,467
20.

49
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:46,034
finally.
somebody who can see us.

50
00:01:46,101 --> 00:01:48,233
oh, don't mind them.
they're all on edge

51
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,867
about the ship
going to the breakers,

52
00:01:49,934 --> 00:01:52,467
but all good parties
have to end, right?

53
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:54,233
welcome aboard.
i'm betty.

54
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:57,067
um, melinda.

55
00:01:57,134 --> 00:01:58,400
what happened
to you?

56
00:01:58,467 --> 00:02:00,366
oh. phew. so sorry.

57
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:04,215
i was dead in my stateroom
before the steward found me.

58
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,834
blood settled
to that side.

59
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,773
my advice-if you're having
a massive coronary,

60
00:02:09,773 --> 00:02:12,333
don't put the "do not
disturb" sign out first.

61
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,230
<i>now, come on.
you're gonna love the claridon.</i>

62
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,800
i already do.

63
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:18,366
you making friends
already?

64
00:02:18,433 --> 00:02:20,733
yeah, one that's
actually nice.

65
00:02:21,367 --> 00:02:23,156
so you've been here
since the fifties?

66
00:02:23,156 --> 00:02:24,800
no. god, no.

67
00:02:24,867 --> 00:02:27,333
'99. i was a vintage-clothing dealer.

68
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,167
so you said
you're in m-110?

69
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:30,633
oh,
it's a lovely room.

70
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,338
audrey hepburn
once stayed there.

71
00:02:32,338 --> 00:02:33,631
you remind me
of her.

72
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:35,292
it's just up ahead
on the right.

73
00:02:35,292 --> 00:02:36,600
oh, god.

74
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:38,888
not now, mr. linarcos.

75
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:41,433
like i said,
they're all restless,

76
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,233
worried that when
the ship is destroyed,

77
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,734
they'll be lost forever.

78
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,700
woman: well, bribe the steward.
i can't stand our room anymore.

79
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:47,834
at least you can
breathe in here.

80
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,167
man: the ship's
sold out.

81
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:51,000
whoever booked this room
is gonna be here any minute.

82
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:52,000
then we should hurry.

83
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:55,667
uh, hi. i think
this is our room. heh.

84
00:02:56,253 --> 00:02:58,034
right. sorry.

85
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,033
we were...  just um..

86
00:03:00,033 --> 00:03:01,400
being nosy. heh.

87
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,101
hi. i'm rich henderson,

88
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:07,193
and this is my fiancée-
i mean-heh-my wife.

89
00:03:07,193 --> 00:03:10,167
julia. it's hard to tell,
but we're on our honeymoon.

90
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:11,433
aww.
congratulations.

91
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,037
i- i'm melinda, and this
is my husband jim.

92
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:16,667
we're in-in 108,
right next door.

93
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:19,067
oh. have you guys been here
since the start of the trip?

94
00:03:19,134 --> 00:03:20,644
southampton
to halifax,

95
00:03:20,644 --> 00:03:21,972
and now here we are.

96
00:03:21,972 --> 00:03:24,101
rich's idea.
he's sort of a ship geek.

97
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:27,134
personally, you can't scrap
the old tub fast enough for me.

98
00:03:27,201 --> 00:03:29,867
<i>the s.s. claridon is one of
the last true ocean liners.</i>

99
00:03:29,934 --> 00:03:31,134
and if we didn't
take this trip now-

100
00:03:31,201 --> 00:03:32,931
then we'd be
on a beach in maul.

101
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:36,206
i warn you, if your a.c.
is anything like ours,

102
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:38,201
keep your underwear
in the minibar.

103
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:40,281
rich: so sorry.

104
00:03:40,281 --> 00:03:41,500
bon voyage.

105
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,119
ooh, i am
so sorry i'm late.

106
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:54,727
did you know that there
are over 55 kinds

107
00:03:54,727 --> 00:03:56,998
<i>of exotic woods
on the s.s. claridon?</i>

108
00:03:56,998 --> 00:03:59,474
you know, i've been reading about
this for the last, um, half an hour.

109
00:03:59,474 --> 00:04:01,311
oh, i swear
i tried to text you.

110
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:04,165
yeah, cell service
is so spotty on the high seas.

111
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:06,700
what happened?

112
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:08,800
well, the spa was a zoo,

113
00:04:08,867 --> 00:04:11,600
and their best masseur
quit in halifax,

114
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:16,075
but there is still time for a
romantic stroll before dinner.

115
00:04:16,384 --> 00:04:18,312
do i have to wear
a penguin suit for that?

116
00:04:18,312 --> 00:04:20,166
no. first night, it's
just jacket and tie,

117
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,879
and don't worry, 'cause
you won't be in it long.

118
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,800
oh. so there's an upside.

119
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:28,300
you know, i never take for
granted how lucky we are.

120
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,331
me either.

121
00:04:31,202 --> 00:04:33,034
ok, what are we
talkin' about here?

122
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:35,433
well, i ran into julia
at the spa,

123
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,763
and she kept apologizing
for trying to steal our room,

124
00:04:37,763 --> 00:04:41,000
but i guess they're having
some problems, you know, in bed.

125
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:42,266
ohh. on their honeymoon?
yikes.

126
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,300
i know. i guess every
time it gets romantic,

127
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:45,704
he falls asleep.

128
00:04:45,704 --> 00:04:47,040
that's why they
wanted to switch,

129
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,108
'cause it was too hot.

130
00:04:48,108 --> 00:04:49,881
or not hot enough
by the looks of it.

131
00:04:49,881 --> 00:04:52,433
you know,
you do have a spooky knack

132
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,400
for getting people
to open up to you.

133
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:56,433
yeah. except usually
it's after they've died.

134
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,667
hmm.

135
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:01,700
oh.

136
00:05:02,323 --> 00:05:04,098
poor guy.
what's wrong with him?

137
00:05:04,098 --> 00:05:05,266
i mean, is he sick,

138
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,662
is it just the pressure
from the honeymoon, or what?

139
00:05:09,271 --> 00:05:11,433
there's a third option.

140
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,734
girl: can you see us?

143

jim: wow.
a kissing ghost.

144
00:05:54,674 --> 00:05:55,625
little kinky.

145
00:05:55,626 --> 00:05:56,819
it's not sexy.

146
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:59,180
i mean, she's all banged up
and covered in seaweed.

147
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,775
wait a minute. do you
think she's the woman

148
00:06:00,775 --> 00:06:02,082
that delia
was talkin' about?

149
00:06:02,082 --> 00:06:03,283
it's possible.

150
00:06:03,283 --> 00:06:05,025
then why is she
haunting rich?

151
00:06:05,393 --> 00:06:08,259
well, that's a good question,
but whatever the answer is,

152
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,735
we know why there are not
sparks flying in the bedroom.

153
00:06:10,735 --> 00:06:12,749
now, wait a minute. you
think he's having an affair

154
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:14,548
with the jumper
on his honeymoon?

155
00:06:14,993 --> 00:06:17,279
well, she's haunting
his tongue for some reason.

156
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,562
good luck
bringing that up

157
00:06:18,562 --> 00:06:19,645
in casual conversation.

158
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,065
actually, i was hoping
that you could

159
00:06:21,065 --> 00:06:22,792
hang out with him.
you know, guy talk.

160
00:06:23,074 --> 00:06:24,886
do we have to
get involved in this?

161
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:27,062
yes. she's a very
powerful ghost,

162
00:06:27,062 --> 00:06:28,642
and she's practically
feeding off of him.

163
00:06:28,642 --> 00:06:29,953
but you said
that's what ghosts do,

164
00:06:29,953 --> 00:06:31,637
they feed off the energy
of the living.

165
00:06:31,637 --> 00:06:33,318
right, but she's the reason
he's not sleeping,

166
00:06:33,318 --> 00:06:35,627
which could make their marriage
end before it even started.

167
00:06:35,627 --> 00:06:37,606
oh, hi. again.

168
00:06:37,714 --> 00:06:41,779
hi. you haven't seen my
so-called husband, have you?

169
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,426
uh, y-

170
00:06:44,493 --> 00:06:45,708
yeah, he was
on the deck,

171
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,349
taking a nap
a little while ago.

172
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:48,724
are you kidding me?

173
00:06:49,001 --> 00:06:50,380
that's the-

174
00:06:50,516 --> 00:06:51,656
finally.

175
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:56,620
sorry. i-
i was changing.

176
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,713
next thing i know,
i- i woke up on deck.

177
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:00,993
you're sleepwalking again?

178
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:03,435
rich, you've gotta go see
the ship's doctor.

179
00:07:03,435 --> 00:07:05,049
i'll call her
in the morning.

180
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,468
well,
we should, uh-

181
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,099
uh, join you,
if that's ok.

182
00:07:08,893 --> 00:07:10,182
please.

183
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,747
rich: america is the last holder of the blue
riband for the fastest transatlantic crossing.

184
00:07:28,747 --> 00:07:30,767
<i>and the s.s. united states
could go faster in reverse</i>

185
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:33,647
<i>than the claridon
can go forward, even today.</i>

186
00:07:33,647 --> 00:07:35,646
but she was never
built for speed.

187
00:07:35,646 --> 00:07:39,395
<i>in fact, because the claridon was the
last 3-stack liner ever built, the-</i>

188
00:07:39,395 --> 00:07:41,066
rich, sweetie.

189
00:07:41,597 --> 00:07:43,500
oh, i'm sorry.
once i get started, i-

190
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:45,633
no, it's
fascinating, really.

191
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,333
jim: yeah.
yeah, it was.

192
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:56,200
did you guys, um-

193
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:58,688
were you onboard, uh,
last week? i heard a rumor

194
00:07:58,688 --> 00:08:00,967
that a woman jumped
off, jumped overboard.

195
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:04,026
georgia kent. jumped off
right before we reached halifax.

196
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,433
most excitement
we've seen on the ship,

197
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,870
not to be disrespectful.

198
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,600
heh. did you
ever talk to her?

199
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:11,576
rich ran into her
a couple times.

200
00:08:11,576 --> 00:08:13,047
mmm, just in passing,

201
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:14,825
reserving time
on the squash court.

202
00:08:14,987 --> 00:08:17,941
yeah. he's been playin'
a lot of squash.

203
00:08:18,837 --> 00:08:20,694
apparently doesn't
leave a lot of energy

204
00:08:20,694 --> 00:08:21,978
for other things, but...

205
00:08:21,978 --> 00:08:24,200
jim loves squash.

206
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,600
practically addicted,
right, sweetheart?

207
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,333
yeah. i do.
thanks, sweetheart.

208
00:08:30,153 --> 00:08:32,333
i got a court reserved
8 a.m. tomorrow.

209
00:08:32,998 --> 00:08:34,733
are you ready to lose?

210
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,066
it's my lucky day.

211
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,714
you know, they're having
a karaoke contest

212
00:08:38,714 --> 00:08:40,778
in the club international.
who's in?

213
00:08:40,778 --> 00:08:43,368
oh, i-i think
we're gonna turn in.

214
00:08:43,368 --> 00:08:45,408
yeah, i really should
save energy for the squash.

215
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:48,575
well, i am gonna go try
my best rihanna.

216
00:08:48,642 --> 00:08:50,413
we've been avoiding
our cabin.

217
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:52,208
it's so hot and noisy
in there.

218
00:08:52,275 --> 00:08:54,775
i think we must be near
a ventilation shaft.

219
00:08:54,842 --> 00:08:57,308
a lot of scratching and
banging from the engine room.

220
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,108
more like scratching
from a rats' nest.

221
00:08:59,175 --> 00:09:01,108
and the air that comes
out of that thing in the wall-

222
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:02,442
punka louvre.

223
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:03,675
whatever. it's creepy.

224
00:09:03,742 --> 00:09:06,105
sounds like moaning from-
from a woman singing.

225
00:09:07,408 --> 00:09:10,609
<i>well, they say
the claridon is haunted.</i>

226
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,775
so they say. good night.

227
00:09:12,842 --> 00:09:14,377
good night.
good night.

228
00:09:29,575 --> 00:09:31,508
can you get a message
to my family in queens?

229
00:09:31,575 --> 00:09:34,327
look, my husband probably found some
letters. they're not what he thinks.

230
00:09:34,327 --> 00:09:35,852
there isn't much time.

231
00:09:35,852 --> 00:09:37,535
i need you to tell
my brother those withdrawals

232
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,012
from the company account
weren't mine.

233
00:09:39,318 --> 00:09:40,475
ohh!

234
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:41,742
whoa.

235
00:09:41,809 --> 00:09:44,740
we're all scared. something
horrible's gonna happen.

236
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,797
ok, i-it's nothing bad.
it's just-

237
00:09:47,328 --> 00:09:49,327
just a change, ok,
and i can help you.

238
00:09:49,327 --> 00:09:50,258
mel.

239
00:09:50,258 --> 00:09:51,891
their home is about
to be destroyed,

240
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,465
and they're
getting stronger.

241
00:09:53,465 --> 00:09:56,255
now go. spread the word
and follow me.

242
00:09:56,256 --> 00:09:57,956
so much
for nothing to do.

243
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,223
what? uh, oh.

244
00:10:06,557 --> 00:10:08,256
somebody better be dead.

245
00:10:08,323 --> 00:10:10,123
careful
what you wish for.

246
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,806
melinda?

247
00:10:11,963 --> 00:10:14,623
what the hell?
i thought you were on a boat.

248
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,423
i am. do you still
wanna learn?

249
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,423
not at 1:00 in the morning.

250
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,757
yeah, well,
it comes with the job.

251
00:10:19,824 --> 00:10:22,781
i have about 2 dozen
lost souls here.

252
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,824
so what, you want me
to parachute in?

253
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,475
no. just listen. get their
names, their unfinished business

254
00:10:27,475 --> 00:10:29,190
and start relaying the
messages to their next of kin

255
00:10:29,256 --> 00:10:30,723
and then e-mail me
when you're done.

256
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,790
oh. ship-to-shore
crossovers.

257
00:10:33,857 --> 00:10:36,243
i need your help,
so grab a pen.

258
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,156
ok, everybody,
his name's eli.

259
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,723
he can hear you.

260
00:10:43,657 --> 00:10:45,592
uh, yeah...

261
00:10:46,123 --> 00:10:48,190
the name's rogo.

262
00:10:50,223 --> 00:10:51,403
um...

263
00:10:52,323 --> 00:10:54,170
how do you
spell that?

264
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,590
i give up.
you win.

265
00:11:06,657 --> 00:11:07,590
good game.

266
00:11:07,657 --> 00:11:09,123
thanks.

267
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,523
glad it's over.

268
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,523
it was roast-
roasting in here.

269
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,123
yeah.
hey, hey, hey. wait.

270
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,156
what'd you do
to your back?

271
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:19,824
oh. what-what the hell?

272
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:20,924
i- i don't kn-

273
00:11:20,989 --> 00:11:22,423
i don't-um...

274
00:11:22,757 --> 00:11:23,956
uh...

275
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,023
i gotta hit
the showers.

276
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:28,323
yeah. right.

277
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,102
hey, uh, excuse me.

278
00:11:32,102 --> 00:11:34,081
could-could you
help me win a bet?

279
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:35,457
i don't know. can i?

280
00:11:35,523 --> 00:11:37,623
um, look, my buddy here
says he played

281
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:38,890
every morning
of the transatlantic,

282
00:11:38,956 --> 00:11:40,156
but i don't believe him.

283
00:11:40,223 --> 00:11:41,790
uh, his name's
richard henderson.

284
00:11:44,464 --> 00:11:45,920
hope you didn't bet much.

285
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,665
he's in every day
bright and early.

286
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,925
doesn't seem to help
his game out much, though.

287
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:53,523
wait a minute. he played with
the woman who jumped overboard?

288
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,690
excuse me.

289
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,914
look. right there.

290
00:11:56,914 --> 00:11:58,790
same name, same time,
3 different days.

291
00:11:58,857 --> 00:12:00,056
georgia kent.

292
00:12:01,924 --> 00:12:03,523
i never saw 'em
play together.

293
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,023
in fact, she came down
at night before dinner,

294
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:08,356
usually with her husband,

295
00:12:08,423 --> 00:12:09,723
booked her time religiously,

296
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,457
but she never once
showed up to play.

297
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,216
hey, you didn't
hear it from me.

298
00:12:14,623 --> 00:12:15,557
yeah.

299
00:12:15,623 --> 00:12:17,023
can i use
your phone?

300
00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:18,690
so she booked
time on the court

301
00:12:18,757 --> 00:12:20,588
as a cover for some other
shipboard activity?

302
00:12:20,588 --> 00:12:21,603
yeah.
but wait a minute.

303
00:12:21,603 --> 00:12:23,478
the day she was booked,
the ship was at sea,

304
00:12:23,478 --> 00:12:25,681
so whatever she was doing,
she was doing it on the ship.

305
00:12:25,723 --> 00:12:27,471
or you mean whomever
she was doing.

306
00:12:27,471 --> 00:12:29,484
well, rich was
definitely playing squash,

307
00:12:29,484 --> 00:12:31,983
and she jumped before
the ship docked in halifax,

308
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:33,231
so-

309
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:35,881
you know what?

310
00:12:35,882 --> 00:12:37,443
i'll see you
up on deck later.

311
00:12:37,443 --> 00:12:39,054
i have to go back
to the spa.

312
00:12:39,054 --> 00:12:40,570
what, another massage?

313
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,535
nope. just following
a hunch.

314
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:49,924
you're good.

315
00:12:49,989 --> 00:12:52,364
i saw how you handled
that spa attendant.

316
00:12:52,364 --> 00:12:54,351
so you really think
that georgia kent woman...

317
00:12:54,351 --> 00:12:55,673
oh, it's simple math,
you know.

318
00:12:55,673 --> 00:12:57,336
she disappeared
before halifax.

319
00:12:57,336 --> 00:12:59,245
the masseur abandoned
ship in halifax.

320
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,053
2 plus 2 equals
a torrid affair.

321
00:13:01,053 --> 00:13:02,570
and so modest.

322
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:03,596
hey!

323
00:13:03,735 --> 00:13:05,505
did you hear the latest?

324
00:13:05,505 --> 00:13:07,238
our steward just told us
the cruise line

325
00:13:07,238 --> 00:13:09,866
received an anonymous phone call
from somebody aboard the ship.

326
00:13:09,866 --> 00:13:11,923
that woman who supposedly
jumped overboard,

327
00:13:11,923 --> 00:13:13,590
they found her alive,

328
00:13:13,657 --> 00:13:15,818
shacked up with
the ship's masseur in halifax.

329
00:13:15,818 --> 00:13:17,123
no kidding.

330
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,623
this woman leaves her husband

331
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,123
and-and fakes her own suicide

332
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,879
so at least her husband
will get the insurance money.

333
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,494
i mean, can you imagine?

334
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,698
honey, they were out
of cranberry j-

335
00:13:28,445 --> 00:13:30,275
i don't know
what's happening to us.

336
00:13:30,582 --> 00:13:31,784
it's ok.

337
00:13:38,391 --> 00:13:40,857
look, i can help you,
but please,

338
00:13:40,924 --> 00:13:43,291
if you're not georgia
kent, then who are you?

339
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:47,667
he swore he'd marry me.
he lied to me.

340
00:13:54,664 --> 00:13:56,564
so we ruled out
the jumper, huh?

341
00:13:56,631 --> 00:13:57,631
yeah, i know,

342
00:13:57,698 --> 00:13:59,798
but this ship is older
than my great-grandma.

343
00:13:59,865 --> 00:14:01,598
i mean, this ghost
could be anybody.

344
00:14:01,664 --> 00:14:03,624
you sure you didn't get
anything else from rich?

345
00:14:03,624 --> 00:14:05,192
no. rich is just
a decent guy

346
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:08,271
whose family, coworkers, and
cohorts are still very much alive,

347
00:14:08,271 --> 00:14:11,122
andid i mention
that he loves ships?

348
00:14:11,122 --> 00:14:12,897
she's convinced
she's gonna marry him.

349
00:14:12,964 --> 00:14:16,214
mm-mmm. he told me he's been with
julia since was in high school.

350
00:14:16,214 --> 00:14:17,650
well, whoever she is,

351
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,068
she obviously met
a very violent end.

352
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,302
what, like murdered?

353
00:14:22,302 --> 00:14:23,547
it's possible.

354
00:14:23,701 --> 00:14:26,806
she was definitely thrown
or jumped overboard.

355
00:14:26,848 --> 00:14:28,714
nothing about sleepwalking?

356
00:14:28,714 --> 00:14:29,776
no. no.

357
00:14:29,776 --> 00:14:31,642
i mean, he had these
scratches on his back,

358
00:14:31,642 --> 00:14:34,186
like fingernails, but-
could a ghost do that?

359
00:14:34,186 --> 00:14:36,314
if she's angry or
trying to tell us something.

360
00:14:36,355 --> 00:14:37,692
like what?

361
00:14:37,692 --> 00:14:38,831
i don't know,

362
00:14:38,897 --> 00:14:40,355
but we better
figure it out

363
00:14:40,356 --> 00:14:42,203
before this problem
gets more than skin-deep.

364
00:14:42,203 --> 00:14:43,024
yeah.

365
00:14:43,231 --> 00:14:44,733
i'll get right on that.

366
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,891
i'm going.

367
00:14:54,552 --> 00:14:56,066
ah, thank you.

368
00:15:02,297 --> 00:15:03,530
rich.

369
00:15:04,731 --> 00:15:06,154
hey.

370
00:15:06,863 --> 00:15:08,697
the, uh-
the 3:08 cocktail's

371
00:15:08,764 --> 00:15:10,630
the most important
drink of the day.

372
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,530
i'm celebrating.

373
00:15:16,184 --> 00:15:18,831
ship's doctor gave me
a clean bill of health.

374
00:15:19,863 --> 00:15:21,571
there's nothing wrong
with me.

375
00:15:21,996 --> 00:15:23,430
cheers.

376
00:15:23,497 --> 00:15:25,664
can i get a beer? tap.

377
00:15:28,497 --> 00:15:30,524
<i>claridon isn't the only thing
heading to the scrap yard</i>

378
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:32,293
she's draggin'
my marriage with her.

379
00:15:32,293 --> 00:15:34,764
ah. you sleepin' a lot,
too, huh?

380
00:15:35,195 --> 00:15:36,197
too?

381
00:15:36,263 --> 00:15:39,556
yeah, i mean, i'm
- i don't know about you, but i'm exhausted.

382
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:44,530
i mean, i keep fallin' asleep, you
know, at the worst possible moments.

383
00:15:44,597 --> 00:15:46,597
my wife's gettin' crazy
about it.

384
00:15:46,664 --> 00:15:47,831
you havin' dreams?

385
00:15:47,896 --> 00:15:49,930
yeah, but i-i mean,
i don't remember them

386
00:15:49,996 --> 00:15:51,364
when i wake up.
what about you?

387
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,697
you kidding me?

388
00:15:52,764 --> 00:15:54,783
almost like
they aren't dreams.

389
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,764
and this morning,
when you saw

390
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,882
those scratches
on my back-

391
00:15:58,882 --> 00:16:00,464
yeah, what was
goin' on with that?

392
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:03,622
heh. i know it
sounds crazy, but...

393
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,697
there's this woman-

394
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:08,430
long hair, wearing
this ripped ball gown,

395
00:16:08,497 --> 00:16:10,454
and-and she's
all over me,

396
00:16:10,454 --> 00:16:12,236
her fingernails.

397
00:16:12,236 --> 00:16:13,963
how can a dream
do that?

398
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:14,996
you got me.

399
00:16:15,063 --> 00:16:16,664
always begins
in our cabin.

400
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:19,597
gets so hot in there
i can barely breathe,

401
00:16:19,664 --> 00:16:21,930
and i don't even
remember falling asleep,

402
00:16:21,996 --> 00:16:24,564
and she's
whispering in my ear,

403
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,896
kissing me.

404
00:16:26,048 --> 00:16:27,752
used to be able to
wake myself out of it,

405
00:16:27,752 --> 00:16:29,654
but now, i-it's like
i'm losing my will.

406
00:16:29,654 --> 00:16:31,247
i just go with it,
and then...

407
00:16:32,096 --> 00:16:34,697
i mean, i know
it's just a dream,

408
00:16:34,764 --> 00:16:36,330
but i-i mean,
on my honeymoon?

409
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,978
and then
she takes my hand,

410
00:16:38,978 --> 00:16:41,364
leads me out.
i wake up...

411
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,002
somewhere with no idea
how i got there.

412
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:50,097
you're not havin'
the same thing?

413
00:16:50,163 --> 00:16:51,664
no.

414
00:16:52,171 --> 00:16:53,644
old girlfriend, maybe?

415
00:16:53,644 --> 00:16:55,153
nah. i've never
seen her before.

416
00:16:55,153 --> 00:16:57,364
hey, look, you-you know a lot
about this boat, don't you?

417
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,297
<i>you know a lot about
the s.s. claridon.</i>

418
00:16:59,364 --> 00:17:00,764
more than anyone
should know. why?

419
00:17:00,831 --> 00:17:01,996
do you know anything
about, um-

420
00:17:02,623 --> 00:17:04,930
i don't know. the room
you're stayin' in, m-108.

421
00:17:04,996 --> 00:17:07,277
i'm-i'm more
of a rivet counter.

422
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:09,963
bill bradford might be able
to help you out there. why?

423
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,030
who's that?

424
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:12,397
maritime historian.

425
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:15,297
he's doing a book signing up
on the main deck right now.

426
00:17:15,364 --> 00:17:16,564
right.
what's this, uh-

427
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,797
nothing. uh, you know,
i gotta talk to my wife.

428
00:17:18,863 --> 00:17:20,797
um, just somethin' she'd
be really interested in.

429
00:17:20,863 --> 00:17:23,630
sorry, man.
here, this one's on me.

430
00:17:23,697 --> 00:17:25,153
take it easy.
thanks.

431
00:17:29,497 --> 00:17:30,912
there you go. enjoy.

432
00:17:32,097 --> 00:17:33,347
hi, mr. bradford.

433
00:17:33,347 --> 00:17:34,995
could you sign it
to melinda?

434
00:17:34,995 --> 00:17:36,868
please. it's bill,
and i'd be delighted.

435
00:17:38,382 --> 00:17:40,197
do you mind if i ask you
a strange question?

436
00:17:40,263 --> 00:17:42,842
i travel on ships
year-round lecturing

437
00:17:42,842 --> 00:17:45,973
and meeting every kind of
liner looney you can imagine.

438
00:17:45,973 --> 00:17:47,788
believe me,
nothing's strange.

439
00:17:47,788 --> 00:17:49,797
uh, it's about cabin m-108.

440
00:17:49,863 --> 00:17:52,963
has anything tragic
ever happened in there?

441
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,197
m-108?

442
00:17:54,263 --> 00:17:55,797
are you asking
if it's haunted?

443
00:17:55,863 --> 00:17:58,276
'cause i've got news for you.
this whole ship is haunted.

444
00:17:58,276 --> 00:17:59,764
you think?

445
00:17:59,831 --> 00:18:01,397
oh, ghosts everywhere.

446
00:18:01,464 --> 00:18:03,097
if you believe
that sort of thing.

447
00:18:03,163 --> 00:18:04,688
personally, i don't.

448
00:18:04,688 --> 00:18:06,664
funny, you don't look
like a ghost chaser.

449
00:18:06,731 --> 00:18:08,147
uh, i just have a...

450
00:18:08,564 --> 00:18:10,097
casual interest.

451
00:18:10,163 --> 00:18:12,445
well, to answer
your question,

452
00:18:12,445 --> 00:18:16,263
there were 86 recorded deaths
on this ship during her career,

453
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,497
but...

454
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:20,163
none so far as i know
in m-108.

455
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,416
except for romance.
excuse the poetry.

456
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,664
lots of relationships
hit an iceberg in there.

457
00:18:24,731 --> 00:18:25,664
nobody knows why.

458
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:27,392
do those records
still exist?

459
00:18:27,392 --> 00:18:29,497
mm-hmm. they're all part
of the ship's archives,

460
00:18:29,564 --> 00:18:31,597
which are sadly also
being sold at auction.

461
00:18:31,664 --> 00:18:33,197
i'll tell you,
it's a crime

462
00:18:33,263 --> 00:18:35,330
what's about to happen
to this lovely lady.

463
00:18:35,397 --> 00:18:36,597
her time has come, bill.

464
00:18:36,664 --> 00:18:38,731
you should know that
as well as anybody.

465
00:18:38,797 --> 00:18:40,545
???

466
00:18:40,545 --> 00:18:42,597
i don't sneak, billy.
cliff sturges.

467
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:43,831
this is my friend terry.

468
00:18:43,896 --> 00:18:44,831
hi. melinda.

469
00:18:44,896 --> 00:18:45,963
nice to meet you.

470
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,063
cliff owns the ship.

471
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,330
he's the one sending
her to the scrappers.

472
00:18:49,397 --> 00:18:51,397
well, he's definitely off
my christmas card list.

473
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,797
<i>the claridon's
completely outdated,</i>

474
00:18:52,863 --> 00:18:55,992
and when the new safety
regulations kick in in 2010,

475
00:18:55,992 --> 00:18:58,996
practically have to gut the
whole ship and start over again.

476
00:18:59,063 --> 00:19:01,764
still, it's sad to lose such
a beautiful piece of history.

477
00:19:01,831 --> 00:19:03,330
i'm with you.

478
00:19:03,397 --> 00:19:06,063
well, ships are
a lot like people.

479
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,996
we all have to die
sometime.

480
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,386
now, if you'll
excuse us...

481
00:19:55,497 --> 00:19:57,430
come with me.

482
00:21:01,597 --> 00:21:04,463
tell me you're sorry.

483
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,364
why am i here?

484
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:24,051
i woke up,
and he was gone.

485
00:21:24,051 --> 00:21:26,126
and the door was open,
and...

486
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:28,437
i got here
right as he fell.

487
00:21:28,504 --> 00:21:30,150
he's gonna be ok.
they got him.

488
00:21:30,282 --> 00:21:32,015
you pulled the alarm?

489
00:21:32,015 --> 00:21:34,569
no. i just started screaming,
a-and the alarm went off.

490
00:21:34,636 --> 00:21:36,289
then who sounded it?

491
00:21:36,436 --> 00:21:39,016
i don't know. rich!

492
00:21:40,037 --> 00:21:41,070
thanks.

493
00:21:41,137 --> 00:21:42,669
thank god you're ok.

494
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:45,736
maybe it was
your ghost.

495
00:21:51,203 --> 00:21:53,103
you could have
killed him.

496
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,103
are you all right?

497
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,003
yeah.

498
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,437
i didn't mean...

499
00:21:56,504 --> 00:21:58,437
she was screaming
and screaming

500
00:21:58,504 --> 00:22:00,386
for someone
named rich.

501
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:01,903
what are you doing out
there? i don't know.

502
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,504
i realized
it wasn't him.

503
00:22:03,569 --> 00:22:06,203
who? your fiancé?

504
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:08,829
look what he did to me.

505
00:22:16,407 --> 00:22:18,402
she's looking
for her fiancé.

506
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,556
he the reason
she's so banged up?

507
00:22:20,818 --> 00:22:22,191
i think he may have
killed her,

508
00:22:22,191 --> 00:22:23,601
but i don't know
if she wants revenge

509
00:22:23,601 --> 00:22:25,202
or for him to meet her
in the afterlife.

510
00:22:25,202 --> 00:22:27,663
what i do know is that it
all goes back to cabin m-108.

511
00:22:27,663 --> 00:22:29,350
wait. so we're gonna
have to change rooms?

512
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,616
yeah, just for
the night, but i won't

513
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:31,920
let her hurt you.
don't worry.

514
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,274
no, what i'm worried about

515
00:22:33,274 --> 00:22:34,887
is i'm actually finding this
kind of exciting.

516
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:36,710
i mean,
what does that make me?

517
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,289
a man i love.

518
00:23:11,169 --> 00:23:12,677
jim, wake up.

519
00:23:19,002 --> 00:23:22,202
my husband isn't the man that
you're looking for either,

520
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:23,872
so maybe you
should talk to me.

521
00:23:23,872 --> 00:23:25,401
he's not
my fiancé?

522
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:26,802
uh, no.

523
00:23:26,869 --> 00:23:28,567
is that why you've been
haunting this room?

524
00:23:29,249 --> 00:23:30,923
he doesn't know
i'm here.

525
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:33,569
no one does.

526
00:23:34,536 --> 00:23:36,469
i have to find him.

527
00:23:36,536 --> 00:23:38,503
he has to pay
for what he did.

528
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:45,503
jim, wake up!

529
00:23:45,569 --> 00:23:46,902
hey, wh-wait a minute.
i was, uh-

530
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:48,481
dreaming?
did you see her?

531
00:23:48,481 --> 00:23:50,670
no. no, i can't
remember anything.

532
00:23:50,736 --> 00:23:52,654
look, just get dressed.
the ghost was here.

533
00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:55,469
and i'm pretty sure that
i just saw the word "aft"

534
00:23:55,536 --> 00:23:56,603
bruised into her back.

535
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,948
what does that mean?

536
00:23:57,948 --> 00:23:59,403
the rear of the ship.

537
00:23:59,469 --> 00:24:01,169
i know that, but-
but what's it doing there?

538
00:24:01,236 --> 00:24:02,829
i don't know. it looked
like she'd fallen

539
00:24:02,829 --> 00:24:04,567
or was pushed
against something.

540
00:24:06,202 --> 00:24:08,656
are you sure that you don't
remember any of your dream?

541
00:24:08,829 --> 00:24:10,503
yeah, scout's honor. why?

542
00:24:10,569 --> 00:24:12,432
good. come on.

543
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:13,483
where are we goin'?

544
00:24:13,483 --> 00:24:14,731
aft.

545
00:24:16,103 --> 00:24:17,521
what about
the scratches?

546
00:24:17,521 --> 00:24:18,703
i don't know yet.

547
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:21,202
the ghost just latches on to
whatever guy is staying in the room?

548
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:22,636
it's classic
imprint haunting.

549
00:24:22,703 --> 00:24:24,569
the ghost repeats the same
behavior over and over again.

550
00:24:24,636 --> 00:24:26,369
we know that her fiancé|was in that room,

551
00:24:26,436 --> 00:24:28,022
we know that he
obviously hurt her,

552
00:24:28,022 --> 00:24:29,935
but it's like he didn't
know she was on the ship.

553
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:31,257
she said nobody knew.

554
00:24:31,257 --> 00:24:32,635
wait a minute.
wait a minute.

555
00:24:32,635 --> 00:24:34,136
whenever you see her, she's
running or hiding, right?

556
00:24:34,202 --> 00:24:35,136
yeah. why?

557
00:24:35,202 --> 00:24:36,336
she might have been
a stowaway.

558
00:24:36,403 --> 00:24:38,136
you might be the smartest man
on this ship.

559
00:24:38,202 --> 00:24:39,336
awesome. what are we
looking for?

560
00:24:39,403 --> 00:24:40,770
anything that says "aft."
all right.

561
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:05,196
this is where her body
was thrown overboard.

562
00:25:05,196 --> 00:25:07,254
wait a minute. she was
already dead before-

563
00:25:07,254 --> 00:25:10,425
yeah. and i think one
of the crew members killed her.

564
00:25:11,687 --> 00:25:14,080
so while eli finished
his ghost to-do list,

565
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,793
i spent the whole day finding
out passenger information.

566
00:25:16,793 --> 00:25:18,819
the amount of people
who have stayed in m-108

567
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:20,647
over the years-
mind-boggling.

568
00:25:20,647 --> 00:25:22,344
not one of them died.

569
00:25:22,344 --> 00:25:24,010
yeah, and if she
was a stowaway,

570
00:25:24,077 --> 00:25:26,149
it's gonna be next to impossible
to figure out who she was.

571
00:25:27,102 --> 00:25:29,336
you know, i hate
to bring this up, but...

572
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:31,500
do you think your friend betty
might know something about the ghost?

573
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,518
'fraid not.
she keeps to herself.

574
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:38,637
fantastic dress, by
the way. haute couture?

575
00:25:38,903 --> 00:25:40,555
she doesn't,
and thanks.

576
00:25:40,555 --> 00:25:41,686
sample sale.

577
00:25:42,303 --> 00:25:44,002
ok. um-

578
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:46,053
heh. so you think she was
murdered and then thrown overboard.

579
00:25:46,053 --> 00:25:47,481
yeah, and possibly
by her fiancé.

580
00:25:47,481 --> 00:25:49,253
i mean, i read
in bill bradford's book

581
00:25:49,253 --> 00:25:52,329
that some of the crew would use
empty staterooms for hookups.

582
00:25:52,329 --> 00:25:54,334
wow. so you think
he killed her there.

583
00:25:54,334 --> 00:25:56,636
yeah, and now she's haunting any
couple who stays in that room,

584
00:25:56,685 --> 00:25:59,455
you know, confusing them for
the man who killed her. zip me.

585
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:03,025
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. now, in
your vision, you saw a pitchfork?

586
00:26:03,025 --> 00:26:04,392
pitchfork?

587
00:26:04,392 --> 00:26:05,880
yeah. i had this vision,

588
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,586
and there was trash
on the deck,

589
00:26:07,586 --> 00:26:10,769
like eggs, flour, and
a pitchfork, 3 prongs.

590
00:26:10,975 --> 00:26:13,120
oh, it sounds more like
neptune's trident

591
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,046
for the crossing the line
ceremony.

592
00:26:15,046 --> 00:26:18,400
whenever a ship crosses the
equator, the crew dresses in costume

593
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,322
and initiates anyone
who's never crossed before.

594
00:26:20,322 --> 00:26:22,206
it's called
the neptune ritual.

595
00:26:23,036 --> 00:26:25,858
<i>so how many times has the
claridon crossed the equator?</i>

596
00:26:25,858 --> 00:26:28,366
i'm a ghost, hon,
not an ancient mariner.

597
00:26:29,236 --> 00:26:31,015
jim, we have work to do
before dinner.

598
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:33,384
toodles.

599
00:26:37,336 --> 00:26:38,802
needle, meet haystack.

600
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:40,598
<i>well, so far, we know
that the claridon</i>

601
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:42,648
has crossed
the equator 8 times

602
00:26:42,648 --> 00:26:44,606
during world war ii
as a troop ship,

603
00:26:44,606 --> 00:26:47,754
but seriously doubt there was
anyone in a ball gown aboard.

604
00:26:48,045 --> 00:26:49,331
wait. here's something.

605
00:26:49,618 --> 00:26:51,624
<i>voyage 401, s.s. claridon.</i>

606
00:26:51,624 --> 00:26:53,027
"the fun way to rio."

607
00:26:53,027 --> 00:26:54,841
file for the whole trip's here.

608
00:26:54,841 --> 00:26:56,339
is there a date?

609
00:26:56,339 --> 00:26:59,531
yeah. leaving new york
march 30, 1975,

610
00:26:59,598 --> 00:27:00,865
returning 3 weeks later.

611
00:27:00,931 --> 00:27:02,898
and then crossing
the line twice.

612
00:27:02,965 --> 00:27:03,848
yeah.

613
00:27:05,231 --> 00:27:06,698
what do you got?

614
00:27:06,764 --> 00:27:09,666
uh, pictures of
the neptune ritual.

615
00:27:10,901 --> 00:27:13,030
that doesn't look like
the fun way to rio.

616
00:27:13,097 --> 00:27:15,757
it is if you enjoy having
flour and eggs poured on you

617
00:27:15,757 --> 00:27:17,648
before being dunked
in the pool.

618
00:27:18,498 --> 00:27:19,731
oh, my god.

619
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:20,898
what?

620
00:27:20,965 --> 00:27:22,364
that's him.

621
00:27:22,431 --> 00:27:25,134
that's the guy that i saw
throwing the body overboard.

622
00:27:27,498 --> 00:27:29,598
and the photographer
was nice enough

623
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,197
to write down
their names.

624
00:27:31,264 --> 00:27:32,705
you gotta be kiddin' me.

625
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,727
we need to talk to you.

626
00:27:37,965 --> 00:27:40,030
oh, hi. look, i'm running
a little late for drinks,

627
00:27:40,097 --> 00:27:41,750
but, uh, if you'd
like to meet after...

628
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:44,464
you were part of the ship's
crew in the seventies.

629
00:27:47,064 --> 00:27:49,421
that's right.
wrote about it in my book.

630
00:27:49,421 --> 00:27:51,898
and you were aboard
the rio cruise in 1975,

631
00:27:51,965 --> 00:27:54,293
where a woman's body
was thrown overboard.

632
00:27:54,293 --> 00:27:57,223
she had the word "aft"
bruised into her back.

633
00:27:57,735 --> 00:27:59,622
you know what
that means, don't you?

634
00:28:01,965 --> 00:28:02,931
how-

635
00:28:02,997 --> 00:28:04,164
her ghost is still here,

636
00:28:04,231 --> 00:28:06,244
and i've talked to her.

637
00:28:06,331 --> 00:28:07,932
i don't know if you
believe that or not,

638
00:28:07,932 --> 00:28:10,087
but i think you have
something to do with this.

639
00:28:15,231 --> 00:28:16,598
um...

640
00:28:20,164 --> 00:28:22,405
it's not what you think.

641
00:28:22,731 --> 00:28:24,931
i hated law school,
so i quit,

642
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:28,698
and i was so thrilled to be
serving on this great ship.

643
00:28:28,764 --> 00:28:30,364
i started
in the engine room.

644
00:28:30,431 --> 00:28:31,997
were you engaged?
me? oh, no.

645
00:28:32,064 --> 00:28:33,197
confirmed bachelor.

646
00:28:33,264 --> 00:28:35,865
yeah, but you still
haven't told us who she was.

647
00:28:36,651 --> 00:28:39,115
she said her name
was lorelel.

648
00:28:40,664 --> 00:28:42,424
it was my first sailing.

649
00:28:42,731 --> 00:28:44,997
i was down on the well deck

650
00:28:45,064 --> 00:28:49,076
when i caught her sneaking
out of the cargo hold.

651
00:28:49,076 --> 00:28:51,197
hey. you're not supposed
to be down here.

652
00:28:51,264 --> 00:28:53,898
she had stowed away
before we departed rio

653
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:56,197
and had borrowed
something to wear

654
00:28:56,264 --> 00:28:57,720
so she could sneak
into first class.

655
00:28:58,158 --> 00:28:59,614
jim: you didn't
turn her in?

656
00:28:59,614 --> 00:29:03,264
no. maybe if i had,
she'd still be alive.

657
00:29:03,331 --> 00:29:04,431
i don't know.

658
00:29:04,498 --> 00:29:05,842
so what happened?

659
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:08,679
she was
an american

660
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:10,865
working as
an au pair in rio.

661
00:29:11,465 --> 00:29:13,098
there's this guy. once i find him,
he'll pay for my ticket, i promise.

662
00:29:13,165 --> 00:29:14,631
told me she'd
come onboard

663
00:29:14,698 --> 00:29:16,132
to surprise a man that
she'd fallen in love with.

664
00:29:16,198 --> 00:29:18,831
i'm afraid she
didn't say his name.

665
00:29:18,898 --> 00:29:21,511
so we made
a silly deal.

666
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:22,779
it was kid stuff,
really.

667
00:29:22,779 --> 00:29:24,731
i wouldn't
turn her in,

668
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:26,865
and she wouldn't tell
my commanding officer

669
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,399
i was smoking
while i was on duty.

670
00:29:28,465 --> 00:29:29,564
so is it a deal?

671
00:29:29,631 --> 00:29:31,798
then i told her how to
get up to first class,

672
00:29:31,865 --> 00:29:34,887
and i warned her not
to let anybody see her.

673
00:29:38,015 --> 00:29:40,065
that was the last time
i saw her alive.

674
00:29:40,132 --> 00:29:42,798
she was-she was
running off excited,

675
00:29:43,023 --> 00:29:44,691
so full of life.

676
00:29:45,787 --> 00:29:47,564
3 days later...

677
00:29:50,298 --> 00:29:51,997
i found her body here.

678
00:30:05,188 --> 00:30:07,497
this area is called
the shaft alley?

679
00:30:07,497 --> 00:30:08,761
that's right.

680
00:30:10,703 --> 00:30:12,908
chief engineer ordered me...

681
00:30:14,499 --> 00:30:16,544
to dispose of her body.

682
00:30:17,698 --> 00:30:19,174
she was just some...

683
00:30:19,174 --> 00:30:22,027
stupid stowaway, and it
would look bad for the company.

684
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,561
2 years later, he got his
throat slit after a card game.

685
00:30:25,898 --> 00:30:27,432
served him right.

686
00:30:27,499 --> 00:30:28,698
mr. linarcos.

687
00:30:29,229 --> 00:30:30,921
yeah. i met him, too.

688
00:30:30,921 --> 00:30:32,227
aw, jeez.

689
00:30:32,689 --> 00:30:34,277
this ghost thing
is real.

690
00:30:34,277 --> 00:30:36,021
like you
wouldn't believe.

691
00:30:36,664 --> 00:30:38,263
she knows
what she's doing.

692
00:30:41,428 --> 00:30:43,317
i was a scared kid,

693
00:30:43,998 --> 00:30:48,113
and i was following
some really bad orders.

694
00:30:49,664 --> 00:30:51,650
been haunted by it
ever since.

695
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,524
apparently you're
not the only one.

696
00:30:56,546 --> 00:30:58,298
it's hot in here.

697
00:30:58,365 --> 00:30:59,631
where does this go?

698
00:30:59,698 --> 00:31:02,032
it, uh, goes the full
height of the ship.

699
00:31:02,098 --> 00:31:03,817
crewmen use it to get
from one deck to another

700
00:31:03,817 --> 00:31:05,797
without being seen
by the passengers.

701
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:08,825
wait. honey, you think somebody
killed her and then hid her body here?

702
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,962
or they dumped her
from above.

703
00:31:11,697 --> 00:31:13,834
but she was still alive
when she hit the bottom.

704
00:31:13,834 --> 00:31:16,404
a
- are there cabin assignments in that file?

705
00:31:16,404 --> 00:31:18,726
we have to find out
who was in m-108.

706
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:23,054
cliff sturges.
is that even possible?

707
00:31:23,054 --> 00:31:24,839
well, his family owned
the shipping line.

708
00:31:25,222 --> 00:31:26,839
we could always
go ask him.

709
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:28,136
he's aboard?

710
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,393
no. wait.
now?

711
00:31:30,393 --> 00:31:31,839
he's come back for me?

712
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:33,112
melinda: lorelel!

713
00:31:34,865 --> 00:31:36,835
we have to find cliff
right away.

714
00:31:36,835 --> 00:31:39,668
right.
come on, bill.

715
00:31:44,409 --> 00:31:46,183
mr. sturges,
are you in there?

716
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:49,522
where's the ship's doctor?
cliff's collapsed.

717
00:31:49,522 --> 00:31:50,859
i'm a paramedic.

718
00:31:50,898 --> 00:31:52,937
he was complaining
about being hot,

719
00:31:52,937 --> 00:31:54,666
and then he fell
onto the bed.

720
00:31:54,917 --> 00:31:57,009
lorelel,
you have to stop.

721
00:31:57,465 --> 00:31:58,765
terry:
what's going on?

722
00:31:58,831 --> 00:31:59,998
who's lorelel?

723
00:32:00,065 --> 00:32:01,355
don't ask.

724
00:32:02,981 --> 00:32:05,034
thank you for
helping me find him.

725
00:32:06,946 --> 00:32:09,316
now we can be
together forever.

726
00:32:16,673 --> 00:32:18,566
she died in 1975?

727
00:32:18,566 --> 00:32:19,400
terry: here, honey.

728
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,152
<i>melinda: yes,
aboard the claridon.</i>

729
00:32:21,428 --> 00:32:24,063
she ???

730
00:32:25,626 --> 00:32:27,730
but how?
what happened?

731
00:32:27,797 --> 00:32:29,577
why don't you
tell us?

732
00:32:30,445 --> 00:32:32,630
all i know is that
she disappeared.

733
00:32:32,697 --> 00:32:34,635
last time i ever saw her
was on the aft deck.

734
00:32:34,635 --> 00:32:36,069
in those days,
you were allowed

735
00:32:36,069 --> 00:32:38,565
to have guests on the ship
when she was in port.

736
00:32:39,489 --> 00:32:41,088
we'd been docked
for a week in rio.

737
00:32:41,155 --> 00:32:43,443
i- i met her that first day...

738
00:32:43,443 --> 00:32:44,022
oh, my god.

739
00:32:44,088 --> 00:32:46,585
in a small cafe
on the avenue rio branco.

740
00:32:47,455 --> 00:32:50,775
from then on,
we were like soul mates.

741
00:32:51,022 --> 00:32:52,289
marry me.

742
00:32:52,355 --> 00:32:54,672
marry me right now and
come back to the states.

743
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:56,707
i- i want to, but...

744
00:32:56,855 --> 00:32:58,656
i can't just leave now.

745
00:32:58,722 --> 00:32:59,589
this is crazy.

746
00:32:59,656 --> 00:33:01,122
then i'll send for you.

747
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:03,322
but in the meantime...

748
00:33:04,681 --> 00:33:06,255
i got you this.

749
00:33:07,689 --> 00:33:09,297
we were so young.

750
00:33:13,355 --> 00:33:15,629
they called
all visitors ashore.

751
00:33:17,118 --> 00:33:18,586
then she left.

752
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,589
i never saw her again.

753
00:33:22,446 --> 00:33:24,262
as soon as i got
back on the dock,

754
00:33:24,262 --> 00:33:26,122
i knew i was
making a mistake.

755
00:33:26,188 --> 00:33:27,848
there were some men
loading cargo

756
00:33:27,848 --> 00:33:29,719
toward the front
of the ship.

757
00:33:29,821 --> 00:33:31,955
i just walked
right past them.

758
00:33:32,233 --> 00:33:34,399
she snuck back onboard.

759
00:33:34,489 --> 00:33:35,992
how do you know that?

760
00:33:36,371 --> 00:33:38,121
she just told me.

761
00:33:40,988 --> 00:33:42,589
um...

762
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,712
i have a gift.

763
00:33:45,055 --> 00:33:47,341
i can see and talk
to the dead.

764
00:33:49,888 --> 00:33:51,768
bill:
trust me, cliff.

765
00:33:52,267 --> 00:33:53,821
you should listen
to her.

766
00:33:53,888 --> 00:33:55,689
in that case, tell me
what happened to her.

767
00:33:55,756 --> 00:33:58,489
i've been wanting to know
for the last 33 years.

768
00:33:58,555 --> 00:33:59,921
he's lying.

769
00:34:00,826 --> 00:34:02,367
he hurt me.

770
00:34:02,855 --> 00:34:04,855
she said you're lying

771
00:34:04,921 --> 00:34:06,777
and that you hurt her.

772
00:34:08,122 --> 00:34:09,888
that doesn't make
any sense.

773
00:34:09,955 --> 00:34:12,188
after the ship
had sailed,

774
00:34:12,255 --> 00:34:14,638
i found some clothes
in the cargo deck.

775
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:19,288
i went to find
his room,

776
00:34:19,955 --> 00:34:21,222
m-108.

777
00:34:21,289 --> 00:34:24,389
we had stayed there
most of the week

778
00:34:24,455 --> 00:34:26,331
while the ship
was anchored.

779
00:34:31,327 --> 00:34:33,468
i was so humiliated,

780
00:34:33,888 --> 00:34:35,720
and i knew
if i got caught,

781
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,268
his family owned
the shipping line

782
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,989
and he'd find out
i was there,

783
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:42,594
and i'd just be this
pathetic girl

784
00:34:42,594 --> 00:34:44,756
who was stupid enough
to believe he loved me.

785
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,342
she went to your room,

786
00:35:25,573 --> 00:35:27,500
and she saw you
kissing another woman.

787
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,391
of course. uh...

788
00:35:34,088 --> 00:35:36,334
patsy, my fiancée.

789
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:37,843
what, you had 2?

790
00:35:39,155 --> 00:35:41,662
my family pressured me
to get engaged to her.

791
00:35:41,662 --> 00:35:44,222
that's why i'd gone on that
cruise, to think things through.

792
00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:47,714
that night,
after the ship set sail,

793
00:35:47,714 --> 00:35:49,322
patsy surprised me
in my room.

794
00:35:49,389 --> 00:35:50,322
she'd gotten nervous,

795
00:35:50,389 --> 00:35:52,088
and she'd flown
down to rio.

796
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:54,689
i met someone.
i don't know what...

797
00:35:54,756 --> 00:35:57,143
so i sat her down, and i
told her about lorelel.

798
00:35:58,588 --> 00:36:01,219
if lorelel saw a kiss,
it was...

799
00:36:02,622 --> 00:36:04,519
just patsy saying good-bye.

800
00:36:07,455 --> 00:36:08,988
what happened to her?

801
00:36:12,355 --> 00:36:14,355
i tried to open
the hatch.

802
00:36:16,589 --> 00:36:18,055
but it was stuck.

803
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:23,039
so i started up
to the next deck.

804
00:36:23,138 --> 00:36:24,884
it was so hot in there

805
00:36:24,884 --> 00:36:26,806
and ???

806
00:36:40,258 --> 00:36:41,956
i didn't know.

807
00:36:42,855 --> 00:36:44,422
my god, we-

808
00:36:47,222 --> 00:36:49,055
we were so in love.

809
00:36:50,555 --> 00:36:51,656
i- i'm sorry, terry.

810
00:36:51,722 --> 00:36:54,558
this must be difficult
for you to hear.

811
00:36:54,722 --> 00:36:56,422
it explains a lot.

812
00:36:56,489 --> 00:36:58,821
we've been going together
for nearly 3 years,

813
00:36:58,888 --> 00:37:01,860
and he still introduces
me as his friend.

814
00:37:02,022 --> 00:37:03,888
that's why i came
on this cruise,

815
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:05,890
so that i could
let go of the past.

816
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,331
all these years, i've been
obsessed with lorelel.

817
00:37:08,331 --> 00:37:10,132
i flew down to rio twice,

818
00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:13,689
but the family she was working
for said she just vanished one day.

819
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:16,355
i looked for her
in the states and...

820
00:37:16,422 --> 00:37:19,289
europe. i hired private
detectives, but nothing.

821
00:37:19,355 --> 00:37:21,487
i mean, you probably
think i'm nuts.

822
00:37:21,487 --> 00:37:25,327
i mean, i knew this girl for
one week when i was 20 years old.

823
00:37:26,921 --> 00:37:28,988
but i never forgot her...

824
00:37:29,397 --> 00:37:30,808
ever.

825
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,041
i found this on the floor
the day she left.

826
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:51,913
i thought she'd
somehow managed

827
00:37:51,913 --> 00:37:54,002
to slip it back
into my pocket.

828
00:37:58,055 --> 00:37:59,740
i've kept it with me
ever since.

829
00:38:04,355 --> 00:38:08,251
i've come back to that room
looking for him over and over.

830
00:38:09,008 --> 00:38:10,888
you don't have to
do that anymore.

831
00:38:11,788 --> 00:38:13,555
i didn't mean
to hurt anyone.

832
00:38:15,455 --> 00:38:17,503
i loved him so much.

833
00:38:18,756 --> 00:38:21,475
i looked in a thousand faces
trying to find him.

834
00:38:22,355 --> 00:38:24,870
he's still so handsome.

835
00:38:27,522 --> 00:38:29,540
she loved you...

836
00:38:30,455 --> 00:38:33,455
so much she never
stopped looking for you.

837
00:38:34,555 --> 00:38:36,675
neither one of us did.

838
00:38:36,922 --> 00:38:39,225
we were both chasing a dream
we could never catch.

839
00:38:45,227 --> 00:38:47,597
maybe he did
catch the dream.

840
00:38:49,455 --> 00:38:51,216
he just doesn't
know it yet.

841
00:38:55,955 --> 00:38:57,188
what is that?

842
00:38:57,923 --> 00:38:59,435
it's for you.

843
00:39:00,455 --> 00:39:02,389
you can move on now.

844
00:39:06,689 --> 00:39:08,822
tell cliff he should, too.

845
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,004
uh, it's for
all of you.

846
00:39:28,722 --> 00:39:31,379
you can see it 'cause
you're ready to go.

847
00:39:40,289 --> 00:39:41,955
uh-uh.

848
00:39:53,389 --> 00:39:54,822
hey.

849
00:39:55,222 --> 00:39:56,888
hi.

850
00:39:59,132 --> 00:40:00,669
beautiful sight,
isn't it?

851
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:04,555
i was just saying to jim
it's so sad.

852
00:40:04,622 --> 00:40:06,155
such a wonderful ship.

853
00:40:06,222 --> 00:40:09,167
ah. and that's why
i'm calling off the auction,

854
00:40:10,205 --> 00:40:13,315
decided to put her up for
sale as a floating museum.

855
00:40:13,622 --> 00:40:15,589
why the change
of heart?

856
00:40:17,188 --> 00:40:19,555
i think i wanted to break
her up for selfish reasons,

857
00:40:19,622 --> 00:40:23,835
reasons that don't really exist
anymore, thanks to melinda.

858
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,443
can i tell them?

859
00:40:28,155 --> 00:40:29,978
well, i haven't
changed my mind.

860
00:40:30,555 --> 00:40:32,422
cliff proposed
to me this morning.

861
00:40:32,489 --> 00:40:34,489
oh, my god.
congratulations.

862
00:40:34,555 --> 00:40:36,522
thank you.
thank you.

863
00:40:36,589 --> 00:40:40,955
and now, if you could
all be my witnesses...

864
00:40:51,689 --> 00:40:53,988
saw that in a movie once.

865
00:40:56,915 --> 00:40:58,455
thanks, melinda.

866
00:40:59,835 --> 00:41:01,255
you're welcome.

867
00:41:11,322 --> 00:41:13,487
betty: they've been
going at it like bunnies.

868
00:41:18,122 --> 00:41:19,788
not that i noticed.

869
00:41:21,122 --> 00:41:23,646
how come you didn't go
with the others last night?

870
00:41:24,855 --> 00:41:28,656
when i was 39, my doctor told
me i had congestive heart failure

871
00:41:28,722 --> 00:41:30,522
and could drop dead
any second,

872
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:34,222
so i packed all my best
clothes, my medical records,

873
00:41:34,289 --> 00:41:37,222
<i>got my will in order, and booked
a world cruise on the claridon.</i>

874
00:41:38,014 --> 00:41:40,352
i wanted it to last forever.

875
00:41:41,355 --> 00:41:42,888
so far, so good.

876
00:41:44,489 --> 00:41:46,886
the ship's owner
just told me that he's

877
00:41:46,886 --> 00:41:48,801
<i>not sending the
claridon to the breakers.</i>

878
00:41:50,355 --> 00:41:52,489
you don't belong here
anymore.

879
00:41:52,555 --> 00:41:54,489
you should go
into the light.

880
00:41:54,555 --> 00:41:56,555
ha! are you kidding?

881
00:41:56,622 --> 00:41:59,022
the only place i'm going
is into the bar.

882
00:41:59,452 --> 00:42:01,289
bon voyage.

883
00:42:06,022 --> 00:42:07,612
hi.

884
00:42:08,489 --> 00:42:10,188
all right.

885
00:42:14,222 --> 00:42:16,522
just wanna see if
the fridge came in.

886
00:42:16,589 --> 00:42:18,253
nice.
ahh.

887
00:42:21,722 --> 00:42:23,955
hey. whoa.

888
00:42:25,222 --> 00:42:26,704
you all right?

889
00:42:26,704 --> 00:42:28,442
yeah. it's just,
you know,

890
00:42:28,442 --> 00:42:30,155
the whole time
we were on the boat,

891
00:42:30,222 --> 00:42:31,591
i didn't have
any seasickness,

892
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:33,149
and now that
we're on dry land...

893
00:42:33,149 --> 00:42:33,933
right.

894
00:42:36,155 --> 00:42:37,656
hey, you don't think,

895
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,422
um...

896
00:42:43,616 --> 00:42:45,916
i might be pregnant.

897
00:42:47,335 --> 00:43:02,416
