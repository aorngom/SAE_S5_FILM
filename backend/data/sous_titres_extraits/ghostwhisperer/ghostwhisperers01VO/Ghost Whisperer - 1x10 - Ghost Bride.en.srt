00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,440
Except from the time that I was a little girl,I knew that I could talk to the dead

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,990
It's all right,honey

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,180
Earthbound spirits,my grandmother called them

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,530

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,270

So we found her a wedding dress

17
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,530

23
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,500
And I just want you all to know

24
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,650

25
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,330
And a man who really knows how to love

26
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,610
I just feel like the luckiest woman on the planet

27
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,320
what's the hell was that

28
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,710
You know,I'm thinking

29
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,220
That wasn't just a nasty draft

30
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,710
A ghost,in a wedding dress and something tells me she is just getting start

31
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,950
You looks beautiful

32
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,590
I can't believe how well it fits,just like custom made

33
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,730
How did you find it? Exactly what I've been looking for

34
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,930
Everything is out there if you look hard enough

35
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,630
Thank you,I love it

36
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,160
There's a little tight though

37
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,370
Don't worry about that,we can let it out

38
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,920
Hey,are you Okay?

39
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,100
Yeah,just a little dizzy

40
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,270
It's strange ever since we are engaged

41
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,700
I had the slugish feeling like I'm too tired to do anything

42
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,600
Sometimes I wonder if it's the cosmos tell me not to get married

43
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,620
chest feels a little tight

44
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,320
Let's get her out the dress

45
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,240
I can't get a breathe

46
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,200
I'd better take you home

47
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,070
I'm telling you,you have to eat something

48
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,010

49
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,660

50
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,060
Not that sweet. I already have these all in the kitchen

51
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,870

52
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,540

56
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,920
Who were you talking to?

57
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:14,910
Um...

58
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,310
Lisa,do you remember how you said weird things happening

59
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,000
There is a reason for it

60
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,400
You have a spirit attached to you

61
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,000
You saying I'm haunted

62
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,350
She is one started the fire at the party

63
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,280
She?

64
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,910
Melinda,you are freaking me out. Is this a joke?

65
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,070
I wouldn't have mentioned it if she won't so...persistent

66
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,200
You see her. but...I can't

67
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:54,180
It's a gift. I have this thing I can do

68
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,020
Okay! where is the camera

69
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,650
You and mark trying to punk me,right?

70
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,040
She's wearing a wedding dress

71
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,510
What?

72
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:08,910
I can't see her face. She's wearing veil. She's young and angry

73
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,210
Serena

74
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,300
It's Mark

75
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,650
Please don't mention anything about this,I'll explain

76
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,090
- Hey! Mark

77
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,810

78
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,660
Wedding? what...what wedding?

79
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,360
Honey. come on. You are so stressed. this is supposed to be fun

80
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:38,370
Yeah. you know sometimes it can seems like chaos,but,it's all gonna come together

81
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,300
I promise

82
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,740
It's heavier than it looks

83
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,950
Tell me about it

84
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,280
I'm pay for price for that. I'm gonna check in the register tomorrow

85
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,720
Absolutely not. You'll take it at cost

86
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,960
I mean. what is the good of having a antique store if you don't get the discount

87
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,520
*** you are the one giving yourself a discount

88
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,050
Melinda?

89
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,830

91
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,830
Can you help me find someone?

92
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,710
Not now,I'm sorry

93
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:22,840
You know. I think the least you can do is introduce me

94
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,500
I feel so guilty when I can't help them

95
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,180
As if your plate isn't full enough with lisa

96
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,720
Hey did you tell her the ghost bride? Yeah

97
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,500

151
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,690
this ghost...i think her name is serena

152
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,040
she's mark's late wife

153
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,220
she died on the wedding day

154
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,880
in the car accident leaving the church

155
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,670
Mark was the only survivor

156
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,130
he does not like to talk about it

157
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,850
i know he was devastated but...

158
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,510
how do you get over something like that

159
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,050
i don't know if i ever do

160
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,710
Just learn to live with that i guess

161
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,000
Day we moved in together

162
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,690
weird stuff start happening

163
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,750
like what?

164
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,820
electrical things. lights are flicking all the time

165
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,300
Computers go crazy

166
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,650
And what about you? what do you feel?

167
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,230
That's the thing

168
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:36,010
Sometimes i feel really tired. drained

169
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,430
other times depressed

170
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,820
That's because spirit feed up your energy

171
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,230
And I feel... hated

172
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,830

173
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,790
i know that sounds weird but...

174
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,980
i feel this hatred coming out me like someone always

175
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,190
watching waiting

176
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,140
like someone wants to hurt me

177
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,190
she's not gonna let me have Mark

178
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,290
so mark has no idea his fianc¨¦e being haunted by his late wife

179
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,250
no. now she doesn't want tell him

180
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,930
well. she's gonna tell him eventually

181
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,610
You have to get the ghost cross over for the wedding

182
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:14,790
i don't know if i can

183
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,760
i can't make a spirit go. if they don't wonna go

184
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,800
Man. Lisa is bumming

185
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,480
The last thing she want is Mark thinking about serena at their wedding day

186
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,270
she's just want start the clean ***

187
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,380
You never start with clean ***

188
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,370
people make comparison with the past relationships

189
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,680
Yeah. i know.

190
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,760
That's something no thrown in your face

191
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,110
You know. i know it bugs me Jim talks about his exes

192
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,420
Why?

193
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,860
I just don't like the idea of thinking about him with another woman

194
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,400
Even i know he was a monk before he met me

195
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,570
But come on,you have to be curious

196
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,920
i am curious. i just have to keep them in the abstract

197
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,910
so he went out with a bunch of women

198
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,810
it wasn't ***. the long leg sweet supermodel

199
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,520
Jim dated a supermodel?

200
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,450
i'm not let you know something i don't

201
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,830
i bet your Jim did date a supermodel

202
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,940
i'm totally kidding

203
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,630
So. do you keep in contact with any of your ex-girlfriends

204
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,900
Did you find a blonde hair on my uniform,you know

205
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,170
there is perfectly reasonable explanation

206
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,560
i'm serious

207
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:28,310
Am i currently in touch with one of my ex-girlfriends?

208
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,030
Yeah

209
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,150
really?

210
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,600
Yeah. Stephanie from Connecticut

211
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,450
remember?

212
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,980
she emails me pictures of a little boy's once so often

213
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,600
And i'm 99% sure neither of them are mine

214
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:42,900
nice

215
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,190
look i keep in touch with her husband,too

216
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,860
He doesn't email you,though

217
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,030
what is going on?

218
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,000
nothing. just you never mention Stephanie

219
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,780
yes i did. remember?

220
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,330
a lawyer from Danbury?

221
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,190
make you nerves because she had some scrimption in bride magazine

222
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,670
i just never had her name

223
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:59,000
So she is in attorney. she must be really smart

224
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,180
Yes she is

225
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:06,350
One time she finished new your times cross word puzzle in 102hours and brag it for about a week

226
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:11,000
Did you ever think about...i don't know,getting married?

227
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,660
She talked i listened

228
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,830
well you loved her,i meant you'd live with her,right?

229
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,020
i think i'm falling into a giant marital bear trap

230
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,280
while i have to chew off one leg to get out

231
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:32,620
i thought about it,though,for about a minute

232
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,610
You know? took an aspirin

233
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,160
Hey,stop that

234
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,830
what is wrong with you?

235
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,700
why are you doing this,serena?

236
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,490
How do you know my name?

237
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:29,020
you saw my first barbeque. you know. careful you don't get burned

238
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,950
Serena,wait. i can help you

239
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,760
i'm just look things

240
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,180
- Thanks for coming
- no problem

241
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:49,880
Mark thinks i'm losing my mind from stress. he may be right

242
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,550
You are not believe me

243
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,140
But having Mark believe that is exactly serena wants

244
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,370
we are supposed to meet our minister here to go over the ceremony

245
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,170
i thought if we came here early you can talk to him first

246
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,390
what are you doing here?

247
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,390
trying to help

248
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,350
she is here?

249
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,670
So. what are you two having some kind of shared hallucination?

250
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,870
Mark. please just try to be open

251
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,840
i don't blame you for not believing

252
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,920
but it's true

253
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,280
she is with us

254
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,550
Serena is haunting us

255
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,660
She is going to try to destroy our wedding

256
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,290
She's not as dumb as i thought

257
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,170
Honey,listen to yourself

258
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,920
You realize what you saying?

259
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,590
Tell him i appreciate the irony

260
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,860
getting marry at the same church as we did

261
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,030
She's upset because she getting married at the same church

262
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,470
Is this the same church?

263
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:49,600
is it?

264
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,460
Honey You know,this is my family church. i was ***** here

265
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,420
That book better not be what i think it is

266
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,480
She's asking about the book

267
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:57,680
what about the book?

268
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,890
This is nothing

269
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,370
Just gonna use a poem for the ceremony

270
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,850
i was gonna show the minister

271
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,120
You know where he got that book?

272
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:05,820
Me

273
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,990
i gave it to him because i want him use a poem for our wedding

274
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,280
but at that time it was too corny

275
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,740
what's happening

276
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,130
it's the book of poetry she gave you

277
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,100
How did you know that?

278
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,020
She just told me

279
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,790
Serena

280
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,240
Serena gave you that book?

281
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,260
i didn't even read it

282
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,410
She was dead

283
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,640
Tell him he better not dare read those poems

284
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:43,730
tell him!

285
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,420
Lisa. hey wait. where you going?

286
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,030
Does he really think he can forget me that easily?

287
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,110
How's Lisa. she Okay?

288
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,500
She's all right

289
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,250
She's seriously freak out

290
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,820
So am I

291
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,120

to stay calm

293
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,400
Serena get stronger if you are scared or anxious

294
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,490
what does she want?

295
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,540
I'm not sure

296
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,290
But i knew what she doesn't want

297
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,560
You to marry Lisa

298
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,160
I don't understand,i mean,Lisa is the best

299
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,060
She's wonderful

300
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,640
Even serena's parent love Lisa

301
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,960
Some people just can't let go

302
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,470
Living or dead

303
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,790
Can i talk to her

304
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,660

00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,160

thank you

308
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,860
You know...i thought

309
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,370
When i lost serena i thought

310
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,540
i thought never be happy again

311
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,830
Maybe i was right

312
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,020
Stop interfering

313
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,020
Why are you doing this?

314
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,770
This isn't your business

315
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,670
I'm trying to help,Them and you

316
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,040
i don't need your help

317
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:32,660
How can you call this antique store when half the items are new?

318
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,860
Look i know that you've been through a lot

319
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,630
Mark has too. don't you think he at least deserve a shot of happiness?

320
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,710
Happiness

321
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,520
That's relative,don't you think?

322
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,180
Weren't you happy?

323
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,880
i remember being happy when my wedding day

324
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:03,250
the ceremony was beautiful. everything is perfect

325
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,790
It's a little over-whelming to feel all that love

326
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,820
from your family and friends

327
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,620
And of course your husband

328
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,100
Then on the way to reception

329
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,160
Mark was driving,i was in the front seat

330
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,160
Mark's best man josh was in back

331
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,670
it all happens so quickly

332
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,110
one second we were talking and the next

333
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,490
still wondering why i was so angry

334
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,850
That's a horrible way to die. i understand

335
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,060
You need to understand something else

336
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,470
i can't have you interfering anymore

337
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,470
If you do. there won't be percussions

338
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,700
What is that supposed to mean?

339
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,960
trust me...you don't want to find out

340
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,120
I'm gonna have to switch with bobby and work the graveyard shift.

341
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,630
Is that gonna be all right?

342
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,270
Melinda.

343
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,660
You and stephanie,do you e-mail each other a lot?

344
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,090
What?

345
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:17,990
No.

346
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,440
Once every couple of months

347
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,380
and then maybe...

348
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,630
can I ask you to stop?

349
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,990
Why?

350
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,940
Can't I ask you to do something without there having to be a reason?

351
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,600
Yes,you can. I'm just...

352
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,050
I'm not sure where this is coming from.

353
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,030
You're not?

354
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,330
You are e-mailing your genius ex-girlfriend

355
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,470
who is recently single

356
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,270
hunting for a new father for her kids.

357
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,080
I'm just supposed to be ok with that?

358
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,400
No. But it just seems...

359
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,300
like a perfectly normal request.

360
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,260
I'll do it.

361
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,650
Thank you.

362
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,260
Honey,I got to say

363
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,460
you seem to be channeling some weird ghost energy.

364
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,850
It's not always about ghosts,jim.

365
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,280
This is so above and beyond the call of duty.

366
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,770
It's about honoring her memory.

367
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,040
Maybe she'll see that I'm not trying to eradicate her.

368
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,610
Good to see you again.

369
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,550
It's so nice of you to come.

370
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,340
It would mean so much to serena

371
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,640
if she knew you were here.

372
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,240
Thank you.

373
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,730
Somebody please remove those hideous flowers.

374
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,000
Thank you,daddy.

375
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,880
She'd be happy you're moving on,mark.

376
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,900
Lisa's a good woman.

377
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,010
Oh,she's got you totally snowed.

378
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:58,820
Why are you even here trying to score points with my parents?

379
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,420
You can't replace me,ladybug.

380
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,970
Give up.

381
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,100
Honey,you ok?

382
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:12,140
I'm sorry. I just feel a little queasy.

383
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:16,880
I think I should go back to the car,if that's ok.

384
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,230
She's a lovely girl,mark.

385
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,860
You're lucky. Twice blessed. I know.

386
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,850
I can never forget serena.

387
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,120
You won'T.

388
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,700
Leave. You don't belong here.

389
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,040
There you are. Your dress is ready,

390
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,580
and I just need you to try it on one more time.

391
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,720
Look,I...

392
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,500
I really appreciate

393
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,390
all the trouble you've gone to.

394
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,890
And I'm gonna pay for it,of course.

395
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,430
What are you talking about?

396
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:36,570
There's not going to be a wedding.

397
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:44,630
It's just so obvious that mark has never gotten over serena.

398
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,600
What?

399
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,410
Why do you think that?

400
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,370
We visited her grave together.

401
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,750
If you could've seen his face--

402
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,430
the love,the--I don't know--the grief.

403
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,400
It was...heartbreaking.

404
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:08,230
He'S...in love with her,not me.

405
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:11,580
I knew that I could never compare to her.

406
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:17,220
But I love him... so much.

407
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:22,100
I guess I was dumb to think that that would be enough.

408
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,900
Why don't you postpone the ceremony?

409
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,800
Ok? For just like a few weeks.

410
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,650
Take some time. Really think about this.

411
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:32,030
It's not about a few weeks or a few months.

412
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:34,750
Serena is never gonna let him go.

413
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,710
Thank you both... so much for everything.

414
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,430
Don't you want your dress?

415
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:51,690
Keep it.

416
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,760
You just don't listen,do you?

417
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,810
He's very handsome,your husband.

418
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,200
Masculine.

419
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:54,180
I like that. Stay away from him,serena.

420
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,680
You stay away from mine,I'll stay away from yours.

421
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,030
I just had the weirdest dream.

422
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,290
Didn't I?

423
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:16,370
I wish that's all it was.

424
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,920
What are you doing?

425
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,980
Oh,it's nothing. Plumbing problem.

426
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,810
Oh,I'm sorry. No offense,but I'm calling a real plumber this time.

427
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,770
This is ridiculous.

428
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,680
Uh,wait.

429
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,740
No,you should not have to spend your time on this.

430
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,420
I left out one small important detail.

431
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,180
Oh?

432
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,950
I misplaced my wedding ring.

433
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,740
I took it off when I was taking a shower.

434
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:53,520
I put it on the sink.

435
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,490
It must've fallen in.

436
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,210
Don't panic. I will get it.

437
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,380
You did not misplace it.

438
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,490
Serena,give him his ring back!

439
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:03,840
What? I hate to ask this,but who is serena?

440
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:04,690
Serena!

441
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,640
I don't know where lisa is,mark. I promise.

442
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,360
She just packed a bag and she left.

443
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,080
Was she mad the last time you saw her?

444
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:14,840
Mad? No.

445
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,650
I would say resigned.

446
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,040
This is all about serena,isn't it?

447
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,940
She doesn't think it's really over.

448
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:27,720
And she's hurt that you asked her to be alone at serena's grave yesterday.

449
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,220
No,no,no. It'S...it's not what she thinks.

450
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,820
Well,then,what?

451
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:40,270
I didn't wanna upset serena's parents with what I had to say.

452
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,700
I got a chance here to be happy,

453
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,200
happy the way that you and I never really were.

454
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,890
Lisa and I,we're soulmates.

455
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:59,910
If you really love me,you'll know this is true.

456
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:02,970
Please.

457
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,350
Serena.

458
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,850
Let me have that,serena.

459
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,370
Did you love serena?

460
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,010
I thought I did.

461
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:24,880
I swear.

462
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,380
We were a couple since high school.

463
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,010
We went to college together.

464
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,580
It was just always the two of us.

465
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,230
You know? Marriage seemed like the next logical step.

466
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:41,030
And then serena got pregnant.

467
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,210
I didn't know that she was pregnant.

468
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,410
There's a little more to the story.

469
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,750
He's got to be back by tuesday. Hey.

470
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:52,780
Have you seen serena?

471
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,680
Yeah,yeah. She's over here.

472
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,110
Hey.

473
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:02,800
Hey.

474
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,240
Should you be drinking?

475
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:08,800
Oh. You're right.

476
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,530
You're right. I'm sorry.

477
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:11,890
What's going on,serena?

478
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:12,390
That's not like you.

479
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:14,080
You wouldn't take a chance like that.

480
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,750
I miscarried a week ago.

481
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:23,250
Are you...well,you're just telling me this now?

482
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,540
Mark,chill.

483
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:27,910
It's her wedding day,man.

484
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,430
Hey,it's mine,too,josh.

485
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,630
I knew you'd be upset,and I didn't wanna ruin everything.

486
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:35,990
All our plans.

487
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,890
Hey,we're gonna try again.

488
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,980
I wasn't trying to trick you.

489
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,550
I just didn't want this day to be depressing.

490
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,670
I just don't understand you--

491
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,150
how you can think it's ok

492
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,900
to completely lie to me.

493
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,040
Hey,mark. Come on.

494
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,880
She miscarried,man.

495
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,190
Think of what she went through.

496
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,240
She must've felt...

497
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,810
at least you're still together,and you have your whole lives to...

498
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,870
mark!

499
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,890
I woke up a day later in the hospital.

500
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:10,220
My wife and my best friend were dead.

501
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,980
And I kept going over that last conversation,

502
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:19,370
what josh had said about the miscarriage

503
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:21,790
and what she must have gone through.

504
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:25,440
It was like he understood her better than I did.

505
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:29,310
I mean,he was looking out for her...

506
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:33,080
and I was thinking about myself.

507
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:41,210
If you don't know if you were in love with serena,

508
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,750
how do you know that you love lisa?

509
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,520
I don't know how to describe it.

510
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,300
Being with her,it's like finding a perfect match,

511
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,100
like meeting someone who knows everything about you,good and bad.

512
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:58,270
Someone you never have to hide who you are from.

513
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,640
Someone that makes you feel...

514
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,610
safe.

515
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,700
Yeah.

516
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,450
I had a lot of things with serena.

517
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:11,990
I did.

518
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,830
But nothing like that.

519
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:32,930
She's here?

520
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,450
Not anymore.

521
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,020
I thought I'd find you here.

522
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,080
I've always loved it here.

523
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,410
It's so peaceful.

524
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,820
I'm sorry.

525
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,540
You know what hurts the most?

526
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,510
He's right.

527
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,560
We didn't get married because we were madly in love.

528
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:10,000
We got married because there didn't seem to be any reason not to.

529
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:12,750
But it's important to know the truth.

530
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,350
It's part of the reason you're still here.

531
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,730
I've been a raging witch,haven't I?

532
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:22,320
Oh. I think you should just try and be happy for him.

533
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,320
I wasn't always this way.

534
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,430
Josh used to say we were the happiest couple he knew.

535
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,880
Best man josh?

536
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:32,120
He used to joke with me that he was just waiting for me to get tired of mark

537
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,670
and then he was gonna sweep me away.

538
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,310
Don't be so sure he was joking.

539
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:37,670
Josh?

540
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,240
Yeah,you know.

541
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,190
Sometimes you want what's in front of you to work so bad

542
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,030
that you don't see what's right there beside you.

543
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,370
What am I supposed to do now?

544
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,120
Um...do you know where lisa is?

545
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,110
Maybe.

546
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,400
Maybe you should send her a signal,

547
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,500
try to make amends.

548
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:09,200
Speaking of making amends...your husband's ring.

549
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,430
It's in the left pocket of that ratty bathrobe of his.

550
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,960
Thank you.

551
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,180
Oh,thank you,spirit world.

552
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,270
Thank you.

553
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,220
Wait. Is she here?

554
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,670
No. Just you and me.

555
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,440
Are we ok?

556
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,940
Not completely.

557
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,170
There's something

558
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,330
I need to talk to you about.

559
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:41,350
Do you remember that guy that I told you I dated in college?

560
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,310
Yeah. Kevin somebody.

561
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:44,220
Kevin cole.

562
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,300
It was a little more serious than dating.

563
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,480
You don't need to do this.

564
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,140
I do.

565
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,780
Kevin and I were really close.

566
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,680
We talked about the future,

567
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,310
the city we wanted to live in,

568
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:54,550
how many kids we wanted to have.

569
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,160
Ok. See,this is when I think maybe sharing everything is not...

570
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:58,890
I am not finished.

571
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:05,520
I trusted him... more than anyone else.

572
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:08,360
And then I told him about my...

573
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,660
what I can do,and he didn't believe it.

574
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,160
Broke your heart.

575
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,290
He did.

576
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:27,280
Then I met you,and I learned what love is supposed to be.

577
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,390
You never doubted anything I told you.

578
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:37,220
You just...you just accepted it right away. You know?

579
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,720
You're my best friend,and you make me feel really safe.

580
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,140
HeY.

581
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,000
And I really liked your body.

582
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:51,960
Why do you always have to joke?

583
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:55,710
The flight's scheduled to arrive just before noon.

584
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,270
Mom,you don't need to pick me up.

585
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,180
O'hare's crazy this time of year.

586
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,360
I'll find a cab.

587
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,880
Uh,of course I still love him.

588
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:08,390
It's just that he's not ready right now.

589
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:11,860
Uh,see you tomorrow. Love you.

590
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,120
It's over

591
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,640
All right already!

592
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,340
You won! You can stop it now!

593
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,200
Hello.

594
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,160
It's for you.

595
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,190
Of course.

596
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:58,960
Hello.

597
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,840
I'll be right there.

598
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,510
Thought I'd go out with a bang just because I can.

599
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,720
I feel her.

600
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,370
Why is she still here?

601
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:38,470
I was trying to apologize. In my way.

602
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,050
She wants to give you a message.

603
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,190
You know what to tell her.

604
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,030
She knows how much you love mark,

605
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:49,560
and she's sorry about the way that she acted,

606
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,400
and she's gonna stop now.

607
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:53,760
She's gonna cross over.

608
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,260
It doesn't change one thing.

609
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:02,480
Mark is still seriously hung up on her.

610
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,640
No,he isn'T.

611
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,880
Not the way you think.

612
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,690
You didn't see him at the cemetery.

613
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,380
He told me about the cemetery.

614
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,890
He asked serena to let him go.

615
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,810
He told her how much he loved you,

616
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:17,380
how much he wanted to make you happy.

617
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,030
Is she here?

618
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:32,490
Can I ask a question?

619
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:35,780
Why...

620
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:39,820
why did you do this to me,to us?

621
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,280
What was the point?

622
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:44,060
Because you have your whole life with mark,

623
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,820
all that time to make it perfect,

624
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,790
and I don'T.

625
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:52,350
She just wanted more time with him.

626
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,430
She felt cheated.

627
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:00,950
I'm sorry for everything that's happened,

628
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:03,550
for everything that she's been through.

629
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,230
Tell her I tried to show her a poem for the wedding.

630
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,070
Here.

631
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:14,030
She found you a poem for the wedding.

632
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:15,360
It's on the night table.

633
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,380
Thank you so much,melinda.

634
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,920
"Thank you,melinda"?

635
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,340
Maybe you should thank serena,too.

636
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:35,550
Yes.

637
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,030
Thank you,serena.

638
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,660
All I can say is you better not blow it.

639
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,390
He is a pretty good catch all and all.

640
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,870
She says good luck on your wedding.

641
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:48,130
I have to call mark.

642
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:50,910
Excuse me.

643
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,560
Done my duty. Where's my light?

644
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,620
Um,hello. Where's my light?

645
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:04,740
I don't know.

646
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,240
If you can't see it,maybe you're not ready.

647
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,420
What kind of answer is that?

648
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,300
Where the hell is my light?

649
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,960
"Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,

650
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,400
"but bears it out even to the edge of doom.

651
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:24,390
I never writ,nor no man ever loved."

652
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:31,000
This poem was suggested by a trusted and treasured guest.

653
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,380
Now may I kiss my bride?

654
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,860
Kiss her!

655
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,810
Cranberry juice,please?

656
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,590
Can you help me find someone?

657
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,630
You're josh,aren't you?

658
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:13,680
Yeah.

659
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,150
Come with me.

660
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,580
Serena?

661
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,200
Someone's been looking for you.

662
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,170
Josh.

663
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:41,010
You all right?

664
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,930
I've been looking everywhere for you.

665
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,840
Are you all right?

666
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:54,990
Yeah.

667
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,170
I think I am.

668
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,330
I can't believe I found you.

669
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:35,890
What is up with you? You're like super giddy.

670
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:37,740
I'll explain later.

671
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:42,360
Wait a minute. Serena's gone.

672
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:43,420
She's gone.

673
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,110
Peace at last.

674
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,490
Oh. I just think it's wonderful,you know,

675
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,280
when people can find their perfect match,

676
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,270
who they're supposed to be with.

677
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:52,600
HmM.

678
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,160
What?

679
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:57,820
Um...

680
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:00,180
I'm just wondering.

681
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:03,010
She must be here somewhere.

682
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,160
Oh,yeah. That's right.

683
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,030
There she is.

684
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:07,970
Oh,yeah. Here I am.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
