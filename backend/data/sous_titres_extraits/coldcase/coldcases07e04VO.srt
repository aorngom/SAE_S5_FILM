1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
The following story is fictional and does
not depict any actual person or event.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,200
********

3
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,499
Brothers and sisters, look at
the person sitting next to you.

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,700
Chances are,

5
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:28,701
they have a loved one

6
00:00:29,202 --> 00:00:31,802
fighting in Southeast Asia.

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,099
Our boys are doing everything

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,500
to keep their souls intact
over there.

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,299
So ask yourself :

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,200
what are you doing over here?

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,499
When you look in the mirror,

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,700
does the reflection seek
material gain from the world ?

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,900
Billy.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,100
I wasn't finished.

15
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,600
Sorry, Dad. Sorry.

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,799
<i>He ain't bad.</i>

17
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,900
What does it profit a man

18
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:20,101
to gain the whole world...

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,100
... and lose his soul ?

20
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,699
So, Archie, you said your pop
was William Sanders, right ?

21
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,500
William Jeremiah Sanders.
What it says on my birth certificate.

22
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,800
And my mom Beatrice
passed away six months ago.

23
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,299
Just always told me
he was a drunken bum.

24
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,699
So, why the sudden interest ?

25
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,299
My kid came home
the other day

26
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,300
{\a6}<i>My family tree</i>

27
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,100
and asked me to
help him with this.

28
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,099
Reminded me of when I had the
same project back in school.

29
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,799
Now my son's asking
about my dad.

30
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,199
And you couldn't
tell him anything.

31
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,500
Just want to maybe find
out something about him.

32
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,299
You know, fill in the blanks.

33
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,899
So your mom told you
he was murdered ?

34
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,899
No, no. Old "Philly Tribune"
had a blurb

35
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,199
about a Billy Sanders
killed in 1970,

36
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,900
eight months
before I was born.

37
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,399
Tracked this down
from the Ident Unit.

38
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,900
Looks like you.

39
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,300
Mug shot, huh ?

40
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,300
Guess Ma was right.

41
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,300
What was he arrested for ?

42
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,099
Disorderly conduct

43
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,299
outside a bar.
Just the one time.

44
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,099
Could happen to anybody.

45
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,199
Paper said he was killed down
on Wharton Street,

46
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,600
1500 block.

47
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,900
Any idea what he was
doing down there ?

48
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,199
See the calluses ?

49
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,599
Perfectly manicured nails.

50
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,899
- Your pop a musician ?
- Don't know.

51
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,500
Your mother ever
mention anyone else,

52
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,799
Dad's side of the family ?
Nothing.

53
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,100
That's why I'm here, Detective.

54
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,300
When you find anything...

55
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,200
Sure. Um...

56
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,300
We'll let you know.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,499
Well, the dad was a reverend.

58
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,199
Billy played the organ
at his church.

59
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,199
Only people interviewed
were, uh, friends, family

60
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,199
from the congregation.

61
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,199
What's a church boy doing

62
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,399
hanging down on Wharton Street
Friday night ?

63
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,600
Think I know.

64
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,299
Ain't seen one of these
for 30 years.

65
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,200
You got to get out more, Will.

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,800
Check out the bee in the middle.

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,799
VIP pass to The Hive.

68
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,299
After-hours jazz spot
back in the day,

69
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,700
just a block from where Billy
was killed.

70
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,599
He would have been a regular.

71
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,500
Were you a card
carrying member, too ?

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,400
I wish.

73
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,400
You had a Jack of Clubs,

74
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,099
you weren't some drunken bum,
like Mom said.

75
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,800
He was ????
one of the best musician in town.

76
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,500
Cold Case
Season 7 Episode 4

77
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:13,901
Transcript VO : www.ragbear.com

78
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,500
Soul

79
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,899
Let you out of
your cave, boss ?

80
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,300
Anything to get out

81
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:41,201
of these COMPSTAT reports.

82
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,299
What you got ?

83
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,299
Jazz musician,
20 years old.

84
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,399
Blunt-force trauma.

85
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,599
No wallet
on the body.

86
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,799
ID'd from a disorderly
conduct pinch in '70.

87
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,799
Wharton section of South Philly.
Heavy streetwalker traffic.

88
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,999
Well, assigned thought it could
have been the old flimflam.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,999
A trick gets lured in.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,299
Pimp cracks his skull,
takes his cash.

91
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,099
Murder weapon looks
like a bottle.

92
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,899
Found dark glass shattered
near the victim.

93
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,099
M.E. assessed it matched
the wound to his skull.

94
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,599
There's a state liquor store

95
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,199
a block over
from where he was killed.

96
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,999
So was The Hive, an underground
club where Billy played.

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,100
Will was the after-hours
guru back in the day.

98
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,599
Could only go a couple times
before I got drafted.

99
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,299
Ran every Friday, same
night Billy was killed.

100
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,199
I heard of this place.

101
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,999
It was in the basement
of some house, right ?

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,399
Yeah. Joint was hot,
smelly, crowded.

103
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,600
But the music... Man.

104
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,200
What I would have given
to have a Jack of Clubs.

105
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,799
Long shot, but let's
check out the bottle,

106
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,899
see if we can track where
it might have come from.

107
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,299
- What about next of kin ?
- Reverend Thomas Sanders.

108
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,599
Never mentioned his son played
the clubs back in the day.

109
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,799
You remember any of the
musicians from that place, Will ?

110
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,899
Not by name.

111
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,500
Owner was a tough broad,

112
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:46,801
the Queen Bee.

113
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,499
She'd sit at the end of the
bar, smoke like a chimney.

114
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,600
Maybe she's still
buzzing around,

115
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,799
can tell us if Billy
was there night he died.

116
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,099
Talk to Dad, too.

117
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,700
See if any of this new
info sparks a memory.

118
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,800
Got a kid here, wants
to see Detective Rush.

119
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,299
I'm her partner.
I'll talk to him.

120
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,000
He asked for Detective Rush.

121
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,400
Scotty.

122
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,500
Ooh. Something I ate.

123
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,200
The chili fries ?

124
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,399
Good, though.

125
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,500
Valens.

126
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,300
Hey, Ma.

127
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,599
Uh, just...

128
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,800
No reason.
Just checking in.

129
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,600
What, I can't check on my mom ?

130
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,900
Yeah, fine.

131
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,099
Okay, yeah.

132
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,000
Talk later. Bye.

133
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,699
Ran the title.
Real estate files show

134
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,099
the Queen Bee was
Geraldine Watkins back in '70.

135
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:38,999
Still around ?

136
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,700
Yeah. Runs a soul food joint
out of the same address today.

137
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,999
Somebody here to see me ?

138
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,200
Oh, yeah. He's right over...

139
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,899
We played music for the Lord.

140
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,699
Billy played an organ
the angels envied.

141
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,699
Is that Billy's brother ?

142
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,099
Tom Jr. was going
to be a preacher

143
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,100
in the Sanders tradition.

144
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,400
My eldest was taken
by the jungle,

145
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,399
my youngest, by the streets.

146
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,900
Both jungles,
just different terrain.

147
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,999
I served over there, as well.

148
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,899
You got something
on my son's murder ?

149
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,299
We're looking into it.

150
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,599
Was there anyone at church
had a problem with Billy ?

151
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,999
On the contrary.

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,699
When he died,

153
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,499
they buried him like a king.

154
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,199
His casket, his headstone,

155
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,199
the flowers... all courtesy
of the congregation.

156
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,699
Any chance we can get a list

157
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,499
of the congregation members
back then ?

158
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,499
I'll check and see.

159
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,600
But why ?

160
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,399
Tom, you familiar
with The Hive ?

161
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,399
After-hours jazz club
back in the day ?

162
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,499
Why would I be ?

163
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,699
I don't associate
with those kinds of people.

164
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,499
Ever mention a girl
named Beatrice Sloan ?

165
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,799
What are you implying
about my son, Detective ?

166
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,599
Nothing.

167
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,400
Just trying to find out
what happened.

168
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,200
Well, when his brother died,
it was rough on everyone.

169
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,299
Me and Billy
drifted apart a bit.

170
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,099
He in some kind of trouble ?
Drugs, money ?

171
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,100
No, no.
Not that I knew of.

172
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,599
I just think he may have started
to question his faith.

173
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,399
Know anyone he was hanging
with outside the church

174
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,899
before he died ?
- I'm sorry. I don't.

175
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,699
But may the weight
of the Lord

176
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,800
be on their soul.

177
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,200
Check out the "specials..."

178
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,200
Winning numbers
on the track today.

179
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,200
Street lottery.

180
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,200
Little numbers running
with your soul food ?

181
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,800
Hey, sweeties.

182
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,300
Anywhere you'd like.

183
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,300
Creamed chicken
is to die for.

184
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,400
Looks like a winner.

185
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,200
Got to say, Queen Bee,
step up from The Hive.

186
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,600
Honey,
I'm an honest businesswoman.

187
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,100
Call Vice over,
they going to agree ?

188
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,600
The Hive ain't been around
since the '70s.

189
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,700
Well, there's no statute
of limitation on homicide.

190
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,300
Homicide ?

191
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,800
Billy Sanders.

192
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,300
Oh, Sanders. Yeah.

193
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,000
Sad, 'cause he was a nice kid.

194
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,400
Had this on him.

195
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,500
He here the night he died ?

196
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,600
Not that I remember.

197
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,700
We're going to need the names
of who might have been here that night.

198
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,900
If any of them are still alive.

199
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,600
All those musician cats
wanted to be like Miles.

200
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,600
They came with
a nasty habit.

201
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,700
Any of those cats
have a beef with Billy ?

202
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,800
No. Church boy ?
Not at all.

203
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,500
Seems like a tight
fit for a jazz club.

204
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,700
They didn't mind.

205
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,700
I had to turn folks away.

206
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,700
Shucks.

207
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,700
Tons of musicians
used to roll through here,

208
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,900
but even I was shocked

209
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,100
the night Billy Sanders
appeared on my stage.

210
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,000
Whoo ! Where did you learn
to beat like that, kid ?

211
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,800
Come on, now.
Time to get paid.

212
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,800
Uh-uh, gentlemen.

213
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,400
The Bank of Geraldine
doesn't give money away.

214
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,900
You drank more than you played.

215
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,600
No. Not tonight.

216
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,000
Don't work like that.

217
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,600
Hey, Miss Watkins.

218
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,600
Billy ?

219
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,900
I'm gonna see you and your mom
at church on Sunday, right?

220
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,500
Now, beat it.

221
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,500
Your father know
you're here, Billy ?

222
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,600
No, and I'd appreciate
if we kept it that way.

223
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,300
Sorry to hear about
your brother, sweetie.

224
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,700
Oh, I didn't order
anything.

225
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,500
Be careful, young man.

226
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,800
Thanks for the drink... miss.

227
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,900
My mother's the only "miss"
in my family.

228
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,400
Can really play those drums.

229
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,600
Play a lot more than that.

230
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,700
- Really ?
- Yeah, learn by ear.

231
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,700
If-if I hear it,
I can play it.

232
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,400
So you can hold a beat, but
you can't hold your liquor ?

233
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,500
Well, well, I'm a quick learner.

234
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,900
<i>One more coming up.</i>

235
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,900
Who was the girl ?

236
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,600
Beatrice something.

237
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Older, but wise to the fact
that drummers keep the rhythm.

238
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,200
- Beatrice Sloan ?
- That's it.

239
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,600
Yeah, used to work
for Ronde Brooks.

240
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,700
Ronde Brooks ?

241
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,900
Of Ronde Records ?

242
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,100
One and the same.

243
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,000
But I always thought

244
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,600
that Beatrice was Ronde's girl.

245
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,600
Ronde know about her and Billy?

246
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,200
You gotta ask him.

247
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,800
Don't let the suit
fool you,

248
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,500
'cause Ronde came up in the streets,
and you don't get to what he had

249
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,800
by getting chumped.

250
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,300
Can I get you guys
anything ? Perrier ?

251
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,500
I'm good.

252
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,900
I own every single one of these
on vinyl.

253
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,600
No kidding.

254
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,400
You know, I've got a
lifetime achievement

255
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,900
ceremony in my honor coming up.

256
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,500
I could put aside
a couple of tickets.

257
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,400
Thanks, but we're tied up with
Billy Sanders' murder.

258
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,400
Billy Sanders ?

259
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,900
Yeah, I remember Billy Sanders.

260
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,400
Session guy.
You must've been pissed

261
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,200
when you heard he was steppin'
out with Beatrice,

262
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,500
knocked her up.

263
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,000
Guys, I don't--

264
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,600
I don't date my secretaries.

265
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
Yeah, nobody with money
does that.

266
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,800
Beatrice would go around
to the clubs

267
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,500
and let me know
which musicians to look at.

268
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,500
Billy was one of them.

269
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,000
- You and Billy get along ?
- Sure.

270
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,300
Yeah, we got along.

271
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,300
He had a very strict old man,
though.

272
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,200
You know, when Billy
wasn't churchin',

273
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,300
he was workin' for me.

274
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,200
But he asked me to pay him
under the table.

275
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,900
He wanted to keep it quiet.

276
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,800
So, why didn't you come forward,
make a statement after he was killed ?

277
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,500
I didn't even hear about it
until a week later.

278
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,100
Kid quit coming around.

279
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,900
- Why's that ?
- Why do most of 'em ?

280
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,700
He fell to the bottle
or the needle.

281
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,400
The one thing
I will say
about Billy,

282
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,700
kid was all about the right
place, the right time.

283
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
Hold it.

284
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,300
Yo, what's that ?

285
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,800
You guys deaf ?
Answer me.

286
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
I was playing behind the beat.

287
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,300
Sounded kinda
fresh, you know.

288
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,700
Damn it, kid !

289
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,000
Ronde,
I-I'm sorry, man.

290
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,100
I told him to stay
on the beat.

291
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,800
Stop, stop. What he's rollin'
with sounds good.

292
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,200
It's your drunk ass that's
always trippin' us up, punchy.

293
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,600
Hit the road. Beat it.

294
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,500
Go sleep it off.

295
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,000
You kiddin' me, man.

296
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,000
Looks like I'm kiddin' ?

297
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,000
You, jump in.

298
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,300
Somebody come
play bass.

299
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,200
Behind the beat,
like him.

300
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,200
And with an ear like mine,
some things just stick out to you.

301
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,300
So, who was the mess ?

302
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,300
That would be Buster Large.

303
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,500
Soon after graduated
to train wreck.

304
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,300
You fire him ?

305
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,900
Eventually had to.

306
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,300
After Billy leapfrogged him,
the fellas gave him hell.

307
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,300
He crawled
deep into the bottle, junk.

308
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,100
He blame Billy for his troubles ?

309
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,900
Ain't that what most addicts do ?

310
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,400
Excuse me,
detectives.

311
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,000
So, Buster follows Billy home
from The Hive,

312
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:01,701
bottle in hand.

313
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,700
Cracks him over the head,
takes him out.

314
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,000
Most expensive bottle of booze
Buster ever bought in his life.

315
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,000
Bet you wish all our
vics were musicians.

316
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,600
Freakin' kid in
a candy store.

317
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,000
No candy store I went to
had the O'Jays on vinyl.

318
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,300
Lot to choose from.

319
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,100
You got any Spinners ?

320
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,000
Philly Soul's over there,
on wax.

321
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,400
Buster, right ?

322
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,800
Session guy over
at Ronde Records back when.

323
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,100
There was some other kid behind you
on bass, Billy Sanders ?

324
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,200
You guys cops ?

325
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,600
Well, we're not here
to sell insurance.

326
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,900
You still hittin' the sauce,
Buster ?

327
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,400
Been clean 30 years.

328
00:15:38,401 --> 00:15:40,901
It's all good,
but Billy was killed in 1970.

329
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,700
I got along with Billy
just fine.

330
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:47,600
Really ? Was that before or after
he made you the laughingstock of the Swamp-pit ?

331
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,900
Billy wanted that gig,
he could have it.

332
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,600
Ronde was a slave driver,
anyway.

333
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,900
Feel the same way when you were poutin'
outside the studio after you got canned ?

334
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,000
Looking for your job back ?

335
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,100
Look, hell, yeah, I got pissed.

336
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,200
But I realized that
Billy was just better than me.

337
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,800
It was in his soul.

338
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,300
And he knew what sounded good.

339
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,200
<i>"Papa was a Rolling Stone"
by The Temptations.</i>

340
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,100
Hey, why don't you ever
bring me no drink, Beatrice ?

341
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,800
Why don't you ever pass one up ?

342
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,800
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, baby.

343
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,900
There's a girl here
in her Sunday best.

344
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,700
She says she's
from your church.

345
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,700
So, I was thinkin',

346
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,600
um, maybe I could come
by your place later.

347
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,900
That's probably not a good idea.

348
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,600
Look, come on,
he catches
me here,

349
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,300
he'll skin my hide,
let alone bring you home.

350
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,800
Why's he so against
you bein' here ?

351
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,800
Told you, it's the way it is...

352
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,200
and it's not what my
brother would've done.

353
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,000
- Hey.
- Hey.

354
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,300
How do I look ?

355
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,700
You look great.

356
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,000
Come on, don't be nervous.

357
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,800
Relax.

358
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,900
Ronde, this here's Chandra,
the one I was telling you about.

359
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,800
Got those gospel pipes.

360
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
Not now.

361
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,500
Uh, but you said you'd
hear my friend sing...

362
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,600
Can't you see I'm busy ?

363
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,200
Gotta get these
sounds right.

364
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,300
Yeah, well, you know, you ain't
never gonna get it right

365
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,100
if you keep copying Motown.

366
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,500
What, what did you say ?

367
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,200
Your vocalists got no soul,
no pain.

368
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,400
Motown's got gospel.

369
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,600
Screw Motown, all right ?
This is Philly.

370
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,300
Then let's actually tap
into the Philly sound.

371
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,200
Falsetto from the street corners
we hear every day

372
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,900
-- let's show
that to the world.

373
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,600
What you know 'bout
makin' records, huh ?

374
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,600
I know this mono stuff is junk.

375
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,500
We need somethin' fresh,

376
00:17:44,501 --> 00:17:47,101
a fuller sound
than Motown has ever imagined,

377
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,900
strings and horns,
all on different tracks.

378
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,200
What are we, The Beatles ?

379
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,800
Why not ? They it stole from us,

380
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,900
let's steal it back.

381
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,800
Okay, how 'bout this, kid ?

382
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,700
As soon as you can pay for it,
we'll do it.

383
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,600
Deal ?

384
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,600
- So then you'll listen to my friend ?
- You crazy ?

385
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,000
She ain't a front girl.

386
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,700
She just a churchy
with a fat ol' ass.

387
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,100
Chandra.

388
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,000
That's the last I saw of him.

389
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,300
But the thing is, he called it.

390
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:23,501
Wasn't long before Gamble & Huff
took it to a whole new level.

391
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,700
Who was his friend ?

392
00:18:24,701 --> 00:18:26,301
Chandra somethin',
that's all I know.

393
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,900
Sit tight, Buster.
We may be back.

394
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,800
And Philly Soul was
the next step from Motown.

395
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,300
Takes me back, man.

396
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,800
Cruisin' in the drop-top,

397
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,100
Billy Paul on the eight track.

398
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,600
- Never heard of him.
- Come on, man, how about The Intruders ?

399
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,100
- Delfonics ?
- Nope.

400
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,700
All right, you got to at
least know "Love Train."

401
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,000
Yeah, song from the beer
commercial.

402
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,700
You're an ass, man.

403
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,500
Needle in a haystack with this bottle label.

404
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,300
State liquor store had
nothing like it in stock.

405
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,100
So long ago, bottle might not even
be manufactured anymore.

406
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,400
They didn't recognize it
from anything back then either.

407
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,500
Hit up the Liquor
Control Board,

408
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,200
see what I can find.

409
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,800
This Chandra girl,
Chandra Patterson.

410
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,200
On the list we got
from Billy's dad.

411
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,300
How come choir girl never came
forward after he was killed ?

412
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,300
Lil, you know this kid over here ?

413
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,300
That's the same dude
from yesterday.

414
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,100
Uniforms picked him up on a D&D,

415
00:19:27,101 --> 00:19:28,201
asked for you.

416
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,300
Thanks.

417
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,400
Hey.

418
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,600
You asked for me ?

419
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,900
Uh, I did ?

420
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,800
What's your name ?

421
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,900
Why'd you ask for me ?

422
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,000
Downstairs, your name's
on that board thing.

423
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,900
Try again.

424
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,900
You came in yesterday.

425
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,900
Give me your I.D.

426
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,100
Sean Thomason.

427
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,200
Really ?

428
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,900
That's a pretty good fake.

429
00:20:05,214 --> 00:20:06,600
What do you, uh,
what do you do here ?

430
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,800
Homicide. Why ?

431
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,900
- You got info on a case ?
- Homicide ?

432
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,700
Well, that's cool.

433
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,400
How long have you worked here ?

434
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,700
What's with the personal
questions ?

435
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,200
He's a D-K.

436
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,100
Put him dostairs,
let him sleep it off.

437
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,700
Everything cool ?

438
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,800
Kid stinks.

439
00:20:33,801 --> 00:20:35,601
So, looks  like Chandra's still
at it in the church.

440
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,700
Only now, she's the choir director.

441
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,300
Billy and Tommy were
like older brothers.

442
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,500
We'd sneak out of church events,

443
00:20:50,601 --> 00:20:54,201
find Motown or Stax on the radio.

444
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,000
Where were you the night
Billy was killed ?

445
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,500
Home with my parents.

446
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,200
I didn't really go out
much on the weekends.

447
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,300
Only when you went with
Billy to Ronde's studio.

448
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,600
You never told the police
he worked at Ronde Records.

449
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,300
Billy's parents lost both sons
eight months apart.

450
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,200
I didn't want to add
insult to injury.

451
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,000
Well, might've helped solve
his murder.

452
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,500
Billy changed
from the boy I knew.

453
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,900
He was drinking a lot.

454
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,400
Started losing himself
in the studio scene.

455
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,100
But you wanted to be
in that scene.

456
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,400
Thought I was gonna
be the next Aretha,

457
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,000
but Ronde could care less
about gospel vocals.

458
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,900
Well, the way we heard it,
Ronde stopped you at the gate.

459
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,700
No. I got
my chance to shine,

460
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,200
and it was all because of Billy.

461
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,500
Where the heck is Billy ?

462
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,100
I'm here. I'm here.

463
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,800
I couldn't split organ practice
early.

464
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,600
Dad stayed the whole time.

465
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,000
All right, we're gonna
need separate mics.

466
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,700
Fresh from up here, fellas.
Fresh from up here.

467
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,900
And ladies.
There you go. There you go.

468
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,600
Follow my lead.

469
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,800
Billy, what the hell ?

470
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,000
Don't worry, you can pay me
when it's a hit.

471
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,400
Start us off.

472
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,600
Tempo up.

473
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,200
Just a bit.

474
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,100
Rhythm section.

475
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,400
Guitar.

476
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,300
Strings. Horns.

477
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,900
Choir, come on now.

478
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
<i>"Back stabbers"
by Hope Olaide Wilson.</i>

479
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,000
The Lord is good to all,

480
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,200
and his tender mercies
are on all his works.

481
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,300
And boy, was the
Lord good to Billy.

482
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,200
I know that song.

483
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,700
It was a pretty big hit, huh ?

484
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,400
Sound that launched the label.

485
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,500
He was Philly Soul.

486
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,400
I still have
the sheet music.

487
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,800
You know, Billy footed the
bill for all those musicians.

488
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,900
Where did he get that money ?

489
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,800
Well, not from
what Ronde paid him.

490
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,100
I'll tell you that.

491
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,300
I don't remember a woman's
voice on the track.

492
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,100
When they recorded it,
they swapped me out for three men

493
00:24:00,101 --> 00:24:02,601
who sang falsetto and could dance.

494
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,500
Ronde's call.
That's just the way it was.

495
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,300
Billy didn't get cash from the old man.
He'd never approve.

496
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,500
Unless Billy was dipping
into the donations basket.

497
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,600
Pass the hot sauce.

498
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,500
Well, the father could tell us
who handled the church finances.

499
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,800
If they're still alive.

500
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
What's up, Will ?

501
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,500
Liner notes.

502
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,500
See something off, guys ?

503
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,800
Music, lyrics, and arrangements.

504
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,300
Ronde's a one-man show.

505
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,600
Chandra said Billy
wrote that song.

506
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,900
So, why is Ronde getting sole credit

507
00:24:32,901 --> 00:24:35,101
for the track
that launched the label ?

508
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,700
Steal a little,
you're a thief.

509
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,100
You steal a lot, you're a king.

510
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,000
Get up, Finn Cooper.

511
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,400
Unless you want me to
give this to your dad.

512
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,700
You mean, our dad ?

513
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,500
Must have really
wanted to meet me.

514
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,100
Yeah, I guess.

515
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,700
Here I am.

516
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,500
So, what do you want to know ?

517
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,000
Just wanted to see
what you look like, okay ?

518
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,800
Did you call my dad ?

519
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,500
Not my place.

520
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,600
You could have saw
me two days ago.

521
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,400
Yeah, but there were all these
cops and people around.

522
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,200
It's kind of how
it is around here.

523
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
I don't know.

524
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,200
What was I gonna say ?

525
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,700
So, you get your load on,
jammed up.

526
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,900
There's easier ways.

527
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,300
You always drink like this ?

528
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,300
No.

529
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,500
You know...

530
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,900
It's just like,
things are one way.

531
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,400
Then it's, like,
there's this other sister.

532
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,500
They say you might be coming by ?

533
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,100
Yeah. I mean...

534
00:25:53,901 --> 00:25:55,501
I don't know about that.

535
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,000
Yeah. It's, like, weir right ?

536
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,800
So, uh...

537
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,300
So, what happened
with you and Dad ?

538
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,300
What do you mean ?

539
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,300
It's like he's got this
whole other life before.

540
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,700
But I've never even seen a picture
of the guy before he was like, 45, so...

541
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,400
I guess there's some things
he didn't want you to know.

542
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,600
Like what ?

543
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,300
Well, you have to ask him.

544
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,000
Yeah, right.

545
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,600
You need an officer
to drive you home ?

546
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,100
I can go ?

547
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,000
Don't make a habit of it, okay ?

548
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,600
Uh, yeah.

549
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,700
No, I'll take the bus.

550
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,100
- Thanks.
- You know, you don't need

551
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,600
to get locked up every
time you want to see me.

552
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,000
The great Ronde Brooks.

553
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,800
I'm staring at those
gold records, thinking,

554
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,900
"Damn, if I had a
tenth of that talent."

555
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,000
But it was Billy's talent.

556
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,500
The real innovator.

557
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,900
Excuse me ?

558
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,500
Billy wrote this.

559
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,800
Yet I can't find
his name anywhere.

560
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
That's some cold jealousy.

561
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,000
What happened when Billy learned
you cuffed his song ?

562
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,700
Cuffed his song ?

563
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,800
You know how many people steal
my stuff and call it their own?

564
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,800
See, that's what lawyers are for,
and I think I'd like mine.

565
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,400
- Now.
- Sure.

566
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,900
Course, takes some
time to process.

567
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,800
Lifetime achievement award.

568
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,800
Might have to miss the ceremony.

569
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,200
Uh... hey...

570
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,600
All right.

571
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,700
So, Billy should have
gotten credit.

572
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,400
And one thing I know,
when a guy's in trouble,

573
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,300
he tends
to make hasty decisions.

574
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,900
Baltimore ?

575
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,600
You're drinking
all the time now.

576
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,000
Suddenly, you
care about that ?

577
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,200
Things are
different now, Billy.

578
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,300
You owe cash to some
really dangerous people.

579
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,400
That was to make the record.

580
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,100
You think Ronde cares ?

581
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,100
You think he's ever
going to pay you ?

582
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,800
You used to believe in me.

583
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,700
I do.

584
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,800
Baby, I believe you can
do anything you want to.

585
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,400
But you're
under Ronde's thumb.

586
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,200
You know, and your
dad controls every...

587
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,700
You don't know
anything about that.

588
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,400
Well, I know you won't even
introduce me to your family.

589
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,300
Because I'm not...
I'm not from the church.

590
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,400
<i>"If you don't know me by now"
by Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes.</i>

591
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,900
Damn it, Billy.

592
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,800
Once I make it big,
that'll all change.

593
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,500
No, it won't.

594
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,200
Look at you.

595
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,800
I mean, what do you want ?

596
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,200
You want to fill
your brother's shoes ?

597
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,000
Do you want to be
your own person ?

598
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,800
For us.

599
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,100
I see.

600
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,300
When you're ready to be
a father, you let me know.

601
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,000
Whoa, whoa ! You break it,
you pay for it !

602
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,500
You owe me money, Ronde.

603
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,600
You need to get some
things in order.

604
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,000
Give you enough so she
can go take care of it.

605
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,800
I don't want
to take care of it!

606
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,600
Ronde, this is my song
on the radio. My song !

607
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,600
When it's picked up nationally,
it'll be huge.

608
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,300
Those are my lyrics.

609
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,000
And my arrangements
and my music.

610
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,300
I did not authorize
those extra musicians.

611
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,900
You'll get paid
when I get paid.

612
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,500
You still work for me, son.

613
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,800
Not anymore.

614
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,100
Want out of your contract ?

615
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,600
Pay you for the credit.

616
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
Keep your mouth shut.

617
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,700
Never have to see me again.

618
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:03,900
Ten grand.

619
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,100
Five. Not a penny more.

620
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,200
Fine.

621
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,600
I got plenty more hits in me.

622
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,500
The kid help ?

623
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,600
Yeah, sure. Sure, he helped.

624
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,700
But he couldn't handle
his own business.

625
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:30,800
Hell, I've had 13 gold records
since he died.

626
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,000
I'm a master at what I do.

627
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,600
You know who loaned him the
money for the orchestra ?

628
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,900
There's only one bank in Philly

629
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,200
a black musician
would have went to for that kinda cash.

630
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,400
The Bank of Geraldine.

631
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,300
The Liquor Control Board
couldn't ID our label,

632
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,800
but I got a list
of local distributors

633
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,100
that would have shipped
the dark bottles back in 1970.

634
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,100
Well, they can I.D. it,

635
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,700
maybe they know where
the bottle was shipped.

636
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,600
I already sent
them the label.

637
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,700
Had an interesting chat
with my buddy in Vice.

638
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,100
Geraldine was more
than a numbers runner.

639
00:30:59,100 --> 00:30:59,600
You don't say.

640
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,000
Yeah, investigated her a few
years back for loan sharking.

641
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,500
Not enough to charge her,
I take it.

642
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,800
No, but one sap they picked up
begged to stay in lockdown.

643
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,100
Scared her goons would break
his legs over 200 bucks.

644
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,700
Billy owed
a lot more than that.

645
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,000
That's why he needed
money from Ronde.

646
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,100
Maybe heading to pay her
back when he got jumped.

647
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,400
Hey, come on, Serpico.
It's your lucky day.

648
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,600
Time for some
real detective work.

649
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,800
Nice to see you
again, Queen Bee.

650
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,000
Don't see numbers
running on the menu.

651
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,800
I told you
everything I know about Billy.

652
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,200
Left out you were pretty heavy
in the loan sharking game.

653
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,100
Not afraid to pop
some kneecaps.

654
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,600
Billy owed you
some major coin.

655
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,500
Okay, you got a warrant ?

656
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,800
Oh, you want a warrant ?

657
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,800
That's cool.

658
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,100
Yeah, it'll just take,
say, a few weeks.

659
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:47,400
In the meantime, your
friendly neighborhood officer
will stand post,

660
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,100
make sure business
is on the up and up.

661
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,600
Okay, all right, listen.

662
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,800
Billy did owe me money.

663
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,200
And he paid me back.

664
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,700
Only his timing
couldn't have been worse.

665
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,000
Oh, hey.

666
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,800
Hey. What you doing here,
sweetie ?

667
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,100
Um, hey, Geraldine.

668
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,000
I got your money. $2,500.

669
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,200
It's all there.
You can count it.

670
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,600
No, th-that's fine. Um, thanks.

671
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,900
Thanks. Thanks, sweetie.

672
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:26,901
<i>"Me & Mrs. Jones"
par Billy Paul.</i>

673
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,600
I've never seen Tom so shook up.

674
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,400
I mean, he had
a reputation to protect.

675
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,000
That's a pretty big scandal,

676
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,600
you hitting it with the Reverend.

677
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,200
Not my proudest moment.

678
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,100
But being with him made me feel
better about myself.

679
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,900
Tom know Billy saw
the cufflinks ?

680
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,700
I lied, said he hadn't,
and Tom didn't believe me.

681
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,600
So, he went after him ?

682
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
I don't know for certain.

683
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,400
I mean, considering
what happened...

684
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,000
I sure hope not.

685
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,600
Hey, Billy didn't take from
the church, but get this.

686
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,300
Clerk said she got
an anonymous donation

687
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,300
right after Billy died with
orders for his headstone.

688
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,600
$2,500 bucks.

689
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,300
That's the exact amount
Billy had on him.

690
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,900
Found where our label came from.

691
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,300
Philadelphia Winery.

692
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,600
Communal wine.

693
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,500
Explains why our label
wasn't in a state store.

694
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,800
Oh, it was shipped
to church supply shops,

695
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,600
including one down the street
from Tom's church.

696
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,000
Father catches son on the street,
and they get into an argument.

697
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,500
Dad gets the last word.

698
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,100
Well, it looks like
that anonymous donation was made
with blood money.

699
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:40,500
Told us you didn't
know anything   about a place
called The Hive, Tom.

700
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,600
That's true.

701
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,900
So you don't know anything
about Geraldine Watkins, either ?

702
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,300
Miss Watkins is a part
of the congregation.

703
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,700
Has been for 50 years.

704
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,500
On Sunday, sure.

705
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,700
But you were tending flock
with a separate congregation on the side.

706
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:02,100
Believe me, I've been making amends
over that for 39 years.

707
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,100
Recognize this ?

708
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,500
Bottle of wine
from our church.

709
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,500
Same kind of bottle
that killed Billy.

710
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,800
Must have hurt when he found out
you were a liar and a cheat.

711
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,500
Not to mention a
hypocrite, Tom.

712
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,200
I know I was flawed
as a husband and as a preacher,

713
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,600
but I loved my son.

714
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,000
Did you go after
Billy that night, Tom ?

715
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,700
I did.

716
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,100
Searched all over.

717
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,900
I only wish it would have gone
differently when I found him.

718
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,200
I was at the house.

719
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,200
Mother said you
packed some things.

720
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,700
Everything okay, son ?

721
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,500
Something on your mind ?

722
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,000
I'm leaving home, Dad.

723
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,100
I'm gonna start my life away
from your church.

724
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,900
- You'll do no such thing.
- The music I do...

725
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,500
it's not some sin.

726
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,400
It's me.

727
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,700
You'd know that
if you'd just listen to it.

728
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,100
What does it profit a man
to gain the whole world...

729
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,800
... and lose his soul ?

730
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,500
I can quote scripture, too.

731
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,700
I just see things different.

732
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,100
What I do-- it's like
my own sermon, you know ?

733
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,100
How dare
you disgrace me like this ?

734
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,100
How am I disgracing you ?

735
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,800
Hanging with that element.

736
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,100
Going around town,
borrowing money.

737
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,500
How do you know about that, huh ?

738
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,300
From Geraldine ?

739
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,600
You've got no right
to question me, boy.

740
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,400
I'm your father.

741
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,300
Then act like it for once.

742
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,600
Your brother's looking down
on you now.

743
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,400
I'm not Tommy !
Don't you get it ?

744
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,000
He told me he was glad
that he got drafted.

745
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,400
Don't you talk
about your brother.

746
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,900
So he could get away from you.

747
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,500
They took the wrong son.

748
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,600
You judge me,

749
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,700
but your preaching is
as empty as your soul.

750
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
The sins of the father do visit
the son.

751
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,400
What did you do
after Billy left, Tom ?

752
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,200
Went home... to my wife.

753
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,500
Couldn't even look her
in the eye.

754
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,500
One thing keeps troubling us.

755
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,400
A stranger makes a donation
for Billy's headstone, and

756
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,600
you're cool with it ?

757
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,500
That headstone was gorgeous.

758
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,900
It was inscribed with  Psalm 145.

759
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,500
"The Lord is good to all,

760
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,200
and his tender mercies..."

761
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,800
"...are on all his works."

762
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,400
Whoever did that knew my son
better than me.

763
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,200
All he wanted was my acceptance.

764
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,400
And I couldn't give it to him.

765
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,600
Billy has a son
who wants to meet you.

766
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,300
Maybe now you got
a second chance.

767
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,100
Who else had access
to the wine, Tom?

768
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,700
We heard it was
the choir director.

769
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,100
Still is.

770
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,900
We got this at the church.

771
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,400
Who is that listed
as the choir director from '70 to '71 ?

772
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,100
Delia Patterson.

773
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,400
You don't recognize
your own mother, Chandra ?

774
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,900
What does any of this have
to do with Billy ?

775
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,900
It was exciting being at
the studio with Billy, huh ?

776
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,000
The one time, yeah,
but...

777
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,700
It wasn't for you.

778
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,400
I always just felt better
in the church.

779
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,200
But we got the contracts
from Ronde's office.

780
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,600
You didn't leave your backup
gig, like you told us.

781
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,900
You were fired about a
week after Billy died.

782
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,100
That's why you dedicated
your talents to the church.

783
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,600
You might have had the talent,
but you didn't have the look.

784
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,200
You were only there
in the first place

785
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,100
'cause of Billy.

786
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,900
Without him, you were nothing.

787
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,400
In fact,

788
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,000
you were always overlooked.

789
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,200
By Ronde, then by Billy.

790
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,000
Billy never overlooked me.

791
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,800
Lot of pressure on Billy...

792
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,300
the church, the studio.

793
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,400
I'm sure trying
to help you added to it.

794
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,600
Good thing he had support
from someone like Beatrice.

795
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,500
What ?! Why ?

796
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,700
Well, she loved him.

797
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,200
Love ?! Please.

798
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,600
She didn't even know him.

799
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,300
Paid for his headstone
after he died.

800
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,700
She didn't pay for it. I...

801
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,700
Kept hearing about
this headstone.

802
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,300
Wanted to see it
for ourselves.

803
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,700
"The Lord is good to all, and

804
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,600
his tender mercies
are on all his works."

805
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,100
Psalm 145.

806
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,900
An ode to Billy.

807
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,700
Your atonement.

808
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,000
Now, how'd you pay
for it, Chandra ?

809
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
With the exact amount
Billy had on him when

810
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
he was killed ?

811
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,100
The groundskeeper
at the cemetery

812
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,600
says you're there
at least once a month.

813
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,500
I loved Billy.

814
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,200
Ever since I was little,

815
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,800
he was there for me.

816
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,600
And when Billy needed you,

817
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,400
you were there
for him, weren't you ?

818
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,600
He called,

819
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,900
said he needed a ride

820
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,000
to the bus station.

821
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,500
You don't understand.

822
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,300
I couldn't lose him.

823
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,300
He was the only one
who believed in me.

824
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,400
Ooh! Thought I'd have
to walk the whole way.

825
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,500
Owe you tons.

826
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,400
Oh, it's not a problem.

827
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,600
Why you jumping to get to
the bus station anyway ?

828
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,200
Got to get to Baltimore.

829
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,200
Finally stood up
to my old man, Chandra.

830
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,900
- I'm gonna move out on my own.
- Really ?

831
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,900
And look.

832
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,000
I told Ronde

833
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,300
to kiss my ass,
and he actually paid me.

834
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,700
Shove it, Ronde.

835
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,800
But you're still gonna work
for him, though, right ?

836
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,700
What ?!

837
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,700
No.

838
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,800
I'm going to do my own thing.

839
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,200
But you're the only one
promoting me there.

840
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,300
You said we were gonna make
a record together.

841
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,400
I believed you, Billy.

842
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,100
And we can someday.

843
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,600
Someday ?

844
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,000
When ?

845
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Without you around,
I'm just a ghost.

846
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,100
You can't just leave.

847
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,600
I have to.

848
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,600
I'm gonna go get Beatrice
and bring her back here,

849
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,000
- so we can start a label.
- Beatrice ?

850
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,400
You know, it's because of her
that I'm...

851
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,100
I have the guts to do all this.

852
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,100
Because of her ?

853
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:36,100
Some assistant wants to leech off of you
'cause she knows you'll be something ?!

854
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,700
No, it's not
like that at all.

855
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,600
She believes in me.

856
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,600
<i>I</i> believe in you.

857
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,900
She's pregnant.

858
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,600
And I want
to be with her.

859
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,600
This is something that
I need to do.

860
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,200
No.

861
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,700
We make... We make magic,

862
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,600
Billy.

863
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,400
You know...
You know what I can do.

864
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,000
- You're the only one.
- Chandra, calm down.

865
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,600
You said... You said
we were gonna make it...

866
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,600
- Calm down.
- ... together.

867
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,900
It'll be okay.
You're great.

868
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,100
We'll make a record someday.

869
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,200
This is not about the record.

870
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,000
I'm sorry.

884
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,900
* I'll be there *

885
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,400
* Whenever you need me *

886
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,100
* I'll be there *

887
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:50,300
* I'll be around *

888
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:56,100
* I knew just what to say *

889
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:00,200
* Now I found out today *

890
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:04,700
* Oh, the words
had slipped away *

891
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:09,500
* But I know
there's always a chance *

892
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:13,900
* A tiny spark
will remain, yeah *

893
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:18,800
* And sparks turn into flames *

894
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,300
* And love can burn once again *

895
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,400
* But I know you know *

896
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,400
* Whenever you call me,
I'll be there *

897
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:32,000
* Whenever
you want me, I'll be there *

898
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,800
* I'll be around *

899
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,100
