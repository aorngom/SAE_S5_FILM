May 20, 1967

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,600
Welcome to the
neighborhood.

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,100
Thanks.

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,900
You're gonna love it here.

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,200
Which house is yours ?

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,200
Oh, I don't live here.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,700
Roy W. Dunn, your Sampson Brush
and Housewares representative.

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,200
Noticed you've made
some improvements.

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,900
I sure did--
new carpeting.

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,000
Well, Sampson's
patented spot removers

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,800
and brushes keep that carpet
looking aces.

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,900
You'll have to
try back later.

14
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,400
Wife's at the butcher
picking up the sunday roast.

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,200
Well, then, please give her
this complimentary Tidy Brush.

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,500
25-year warranty.

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,200
Thanks. Mrs. needs all
the help she can get

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,700
when it comes to
the housework.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
<i>"I'll be your mirror"

20
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,500
Roy !

21
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,800
Be right over, Joannie.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I've been waiting
all morning.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,500
Where have been ?

24
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,800
Had something to take care of.

25
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,600
What, pray tell ?

26
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,200
Did you hear
about Candy Toliver ?

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,000
Oh, just can't believe it.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,600
I guess you never do know.

29
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,200
No, you don't.

30
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,500
That Wilson girl from down
the street got arrested

31
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,800
for singing folk songs
at an antiwar rally.

32
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,800
Strange times, to be sure.

33
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,800
Let me check my book.

34
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,600
Can't be the silver polish.

35
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,400
You took delivery
of that last week.

36
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,100
Spray starch ?

37
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,900
You do know exactly
what I need, Roy.

38
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,400
It's my job to know.

39
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,300
Local developer drained the pond
to make way for more houses.

40
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,700
Found a body on the bottom.

41
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,400
Tech estimates male,
mid-30s.

42
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Oh. How long has
he been down here ?

43
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,100
Oh, that's a question
for the bone squad.

44
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,600
This place was a park, right ?

45
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,100
Surrounding streets
all had access.

46
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,900
Weights.

47
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,800
Somebody wanted the body
to stay down.

48
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,700
Can I borrow your coffee ?

49
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,500
Got an inscription.

50
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,000
"Roy W. Dunn."

51
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,000
"Sampson Brush Salesman
of the Year, 1966."

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,300
Door-to-door salesman ?

53
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,500
Sampson was a competitor to the Fuller
Brush company.

54
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,300
Sold a lot more than brushes.

55
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,300
Well, somebody didn't like
what Roy was selling.

56
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,500
Or he knocked on the wrong door.

57
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,500
Cold Case
Season 6 Episode 14

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Transcript VO : www.ragbear.com

59
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,300
The brush man

60
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,300
Little privacy ?

61
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,100
Is something wrong
with your dugout ?

62
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,500
Flooded.

63
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,000
Now if you
don't mind,

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,900
I got to tidy up and tuck in?

65
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,200
<i>Roy W. Dunn.</i>

66
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,700
35 years old.

67
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,500
Sampson Brush Company regional
manager filed a theft report on June 9

68
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,100
alleging Roy checked out company property
on June 6,

69
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,300
then took off with money collected
from customers.

70
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,200
Along with $250 worth
of Sampson products.

71
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,100
Well, guess we can close
the books on that one.

72
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,500
Search of Roy's tenement room
back in '67 yielded nada.

73
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,100
Guy lived out of a suitcase.

74
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,600
It doesn't sound like
Sampson's Salesman of the Year.

75
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,000
Don't see many door-to-door
salesmen anymore.

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,800
Ah, different times.

77
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,100
Used to be you could get
anything from fresh chickens,

78
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,000
bibles to <i>Grit</i> magazine
delivered right to your door.

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,900
Yeah, now I got some guy from a phone
bank calling me during the game.

80
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,500
Lot of these guys just blew
into a town looking

81
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,300
before moving on
to the next one.

82
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,700
Well, maybe Roy tried to run off
with some lonely housewife.

83
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,500
Husband got wind of it,
put a stop to it.

84
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,100
Well, that or he got mixed up
in some scam.

85
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,600
Run his name through the NCIC
database, see if we got a hit.

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,700
Hey!

87
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,800
Missed a spot.

88
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,900
You get anything back
from the lab, Nick ?

89
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,900
Uh, barbells found with the body
were sold in hundreds of places.

90
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,900
What about the plastic ?

91
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,500
Nothing special.

92
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,500
But forensics, uh, found, uh,
deep abrasions

93
00:05:58,501 --> 00:05:59,801
on his ribcage.

94
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,900
Could have been stabbed.

95
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,700
Or eaten by snapping turtles.

96
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,300
I just got off the horn
with Sampson Brush.

97
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,300
They're faxing over
Roy's route
and his customer list.

98
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,800
Start a canvas.

99
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,200
Might be some folks on the block
still remember Roy.

100
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,000
Better yet.

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I got the name of the salesman
who took over
Roy's route.

102
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Harry Hapgood.

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,800
Uh, he's still out there
pounding the pavement.

104
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,500
<i>Uh, didn't figure you</i>
for tighty-whiteys.

105
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,500
Rush.

106
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,100
Yeah, she got
quite an eyeful.

107
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,500
Oh, for the record,
they're boxer briefs.

108
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,400
Right. And the
grooming at work?

109
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,900
I'm in a transitional state.

110
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,000
What's that mean?

111
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,200
Means I got a crick in my neck
from sleeping on the office couch.

112
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,400
Waking up smelling
like nervous perp.

113
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,800
You let Toni move in,
didn't you ?

114
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,500
Yup.

115
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,700
And now you're out ?

116
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,600
Yup.

117
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,300
Roy W. Dunn.

118
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,900
That's going way back.

119
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,200
When was the last time
you saw him ?

120
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,000
Would have been
a Wednesday.

121
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,700
We met every Wednesday
for breakfast.

122
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,000
Right here, as
a matter of fact.

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,500
One day he didn't show.

124
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,100
Summer of '67 ?

125
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,200
Second week of June.

126
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,800
I remember 'cause that week the
company called me to sort out his route.

127
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,500
You got a real good memory,
Harry.

128
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,800
You betcha.

129
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,500
Not for nothing I've been selling
Sampson for 45 years.

130
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,000
Keep the orders up here.

131
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,600
What kind of salesman was Roy ?

132
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,000
Roy had every housewife
on his route

133
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:22,001
pecking out of his hand.

134
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,500
Tall, dark and a double shot
of mysterious.

135
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,800
Mysterious how ?

136
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,400
He never talked
about his past,

137
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,100
and he wasn't
from around here.

138
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,200
I saw his apartment once,
and he slept on the floor.

139
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,300
No mattress,
no pillow.

140
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,800
Nothing but floorboards.

141
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,500
Bit of an odd duck, then.

142
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,200
he looked like Paul Newman,

143
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,700
and he wasn't married.

144
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,800
I tell you, there were a lot
of steamed housewives

145
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,900
when I took over the route
for him.

146
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,500
He selling something
other than brushes ?

147
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,900
Come again ?

148
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,900
Was Roy having an affair
with any of these housewives ?

149
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,200
Not that I saw.

150
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,000
Roy was all business.

151
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,700
And that route of his was
what we call low-hanging fruit.

152
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,500
Same route you took over
when he disappeared, right, Harry ?

153
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,800
Stop right there, Detective.

154
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,500
I had no beef with Roy.

155
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,200
He trained me.

156
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,200
He taught me
how to get to yes.

157
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,300
I'm concerned about
your drapes, Joannie.

158
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,000
What's wrong with them ?

159
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,500
Let's have a look.

160
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,300
<i>"These boots are made for walkin'"
by Nancy Sinatra.</i>

161
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,100
Maybe your friend would like
to join us ?

162
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,400
Oh. I should get back.

163
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,500
Oh, come on, Diane.

164
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,400
Roy won't bite.

165
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,800
I'd really like you
to see this, Diane.

166
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,700
You see this dust
and dirt right here ?

167
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,000
Only way to get rid of it
is take down the drapes,

168
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,700
launder them
and hope you don't ruin them.

169
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,900
Who has the time ?

170
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,600
Exactly why Sampson created
this innovative drape

171
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,301
and upholstery brush.

172
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Dirt just lifts out.

173
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,500
I want one.

174
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,200
Harry, write Joannie's order up

175
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:07,201
and throw in a free sample
of our new skin care line.

176
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,600
Can I put you down
for one, Diane ?

177
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,400
Diane's husband's
a tightwad.

178
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,500
- He's got her on a budget.
- Joannie.

179
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,800
I've got Wednesday
afternoon open.

180
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,400
I can come by.

181
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,200
I should, uh, probably check
with my husband.

182
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,600
I want you
to have this.

183
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,500
Oh, I can't.

184
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,700
And I insist.

185
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,400
Let me know when you want
some of our Crystal View

186
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,800
Keep that window I see you
looking out of every day gin-clear.

187
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,100
I'll bet old Roy put that dust
on those drapes

188
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:48,801
while no one was looking.

189
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,100
Joannie Pogue married ?

190
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,000
At the time, but her husband
was always away on business.

191
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,800
She always putting it out there
like that ?

192
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,700
Just for old Roy.

193
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,700
She around ?

194
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,900
23 Harmondale Lane.

195
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,200
Would you like one
of my lemon bars, Detective ?

196
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,600
Sinfully good.

197
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,800
Uh, no, I'm-I'm good.

198
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,600
We're here about Roy Dunn.

199
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,300
Word travels fast.

200
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,300
Heard Roy was quite popular
with the local housewives.

201
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,000
Well, he was attentive
and polite, handy,

202
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
and he knew exactly
what you wanted.

203
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,700
What did <i>you</i> want, Joannie ?

204
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,700
Detective,

205
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,800
are you asking me if I was having
an affair with Roy ?

206
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,600
Were you ?

207
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:36,401
It was a purely professional
flirtation.

208
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,300
I liked having Roy over,

209
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,700
and he liked selling me
his products.

210
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,000
Uh, swinging '60s,
and Roy wouldn't swing ?

211
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,800
Oh, not around here it wasn't.

212
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,300
We kept up appearances.

213
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,800
You remember last time
you saw him ?

214
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:50,501
Easy.

215
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,600
I went out in the front yard
to get a little color.

216
00:10:53,801 --> 00:10:57,401
<i>"Lightning's girl"
by Nancy Sinatra.</i>

217
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,000
Hey there, buddy.

218
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,300
Show you how
to throw a slider.

219
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,800
Roy.

220
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,700
Yes, Joannie.

221
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,100
What do you think ?

222
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,500
Natalie Wood has one
just like it.

223
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:29,501
Oops.

224
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,000
Sorry about that.

225
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,600
Just toss it back.

226
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,301
Hey, in there.

227
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,900
Need the ball back.
Good luck.

228
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,900
Abnormal Norm just added it
to his collection.

229
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,700
- That's not right.
- Take a look, Roy.

230
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,100
The whole family's
not right.

231
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,800
You don't want to go
in there. Trust me.

232
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,600
Just leave it.

233
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,500
Well, I'm going in.

234
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,700
If I don't come back
call the National Guard.

235
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,000
Hold it right there, mister.

236
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,500
I'd like the ball back.

237
00:12:03,601 --> 00:12:05,901
I'd like you to get off my property.

238
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,500
What about
this, uh,

239
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,900
Abnormal Norm ?

240
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,300
Went to Vietnam,

241
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,400
stepped on a land mine,

242
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,600
scarred his face horribly.

243
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,500
Was never right
after that.

244
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,300
The city's been trying
to condemn the house for years.

245
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,900
Did he have a problem
with Roy ?

246
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,900
Hard to tell.

247
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,700
He was a bit of a recluse,

248
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,500
and the only time I ever saw him
was in the park.

249
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,100
What was he doing down there ?

250
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,500
Feeding the ducks.

251
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,600
Got very upset when he heard
they were draining the pond

252
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:39,301
to put it more houses.

253
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,100
Police. Open up.

254
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,000
Hands off the Creedence.

255
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,000
Get your damn hands
of the vinyl !

256
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
This is private
property.

257
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,400
Wrong move, Rambo.

258
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,100
Should have opened up
and answered our questions.

259
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,500
Just gave us a reason
to search this dump.

260
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,300
Should have brought
your Hazmat suit, boss.

261
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,700
What do we got ?

262
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,000
Besides a million
city code violations ?

263
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,200
Quite a collection.

264
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,700
Hoarding started
with the mom.

265
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,700
Son can't bear
to throw anything out.

266
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,000
She still in the picture ?

267
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,400
She passed
last year.

268
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,300
Over here.

269
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,900
Balls and bikes.

270
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,400
Looks like Norm
had a filing system.

271
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,700
Library books,
overdue 40 years.

272
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,400
And this.

273
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,900
Roy W. Dunn.

274
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,200
Checked out,

275
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,100
never returned.

276
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,800
Roy keep track
of his appointments ?

277
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,900
No, it's mostly notes on who
bought what and the money collected.

278
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,900
Found this inside.

279
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,600
It's addressed
to Alice.

280
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,500
100 bucks.

281
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,100
Lot of money
back then.

282
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,300
Payoff ?

283
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,500
Well, whatever it was,
Roy never got to deliver it.

284
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,600
Miller's checking
the name against Roy's.

285
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,000
That supposed to mean
something?

286
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,100
Salesman named Roy W. Dunn.

287
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,000
- How did you get that book ?
- Found it.

288
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,600
- In the park by the pond.
- How about that.

289
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,000
We just found him fertilizing

290
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
After you killed him
and sunk the body.

291
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,300
Why would I do that ?

292
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,700
Neighbor saw
you and Roy

293
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,100
having words after he went to get
a baseball back for a kid on the street.

294
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,700
That's a good motive.

295
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,800
Seen folks killed for a pair
of $20 kicks and a bus pass.

296
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,400
Roy asked, and I gave
the ball back.

297
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,700
Even though I had
every right to keep it.

298
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,000
Sounds like a real
lifesaver moment.

299
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,100
You're a funny guy, Detective.

300
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,400
No, what's
funny, Norm,

301
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,100
is you assaulting
a police officer,

302
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,900
then keeping a book that
ties you to the murder victim.

303
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,200
I'd say that's good for
25 years of belly laughs,

304
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,700
depending what
the jury thinks.

305
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,900
This stuff's not gonna work
on me, Detectives.

306
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,900
Abnormal Norm.

307
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,000
The neighborhood bogeyman.

308
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,300
What ?

309
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,900
You didn't like the way
Roy stared at you ?

310
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,900
He was not the only one
who didn't.

311
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,000
Roy was okay by me,

312
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,200
but not everyone
on the street liked him.

313
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,900
<i>"European song"
by Velvet Underground.</i>

314
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,800
Something wrong ?

315
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,300
We didn't order
this stuff.

316
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,500
Your wife, Diane,
placed the order.

317
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,900
Well, she must
have made a mistake.
Okay.

318
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,600
But you've already paid
for them.

319
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,200
And I said...

320
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,400
we don't want them.

321
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:08,700
Look, it was not my intention
to cause any trouble.

322
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,700
Maybe I misunderstood.

323
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,400
I know what you're up to.

324
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,600
I know your type, mister.

325
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,600
I was just doing my job.

326
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,800
Then do it somewhere else.

327
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,200
Glenn Drew.

328
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,300
Guy was a hothead ?

329
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,900
Lot of happy, happy, joy, joy crap
on that street.

330
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,800
Everyone pretending to be normal

331
00:16:33,901 --> 00:16:36,801
while the world around
was going to the dogs.

332
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,500
When was this argument
with Glenn?

333
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,300
It was maybe a couple of weeks before
Roy stopped coming around.

334
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,800
Are we done here ?

335
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,500
Or are there more of my rights
you want to trample?

336
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,000
You're not going anywhere, Norm.

337
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,400
I didn't kill Roy.

338
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,500
The only killing I ever did
was for my country.

339
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,700
And look what it got me.

340
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,900
She gave up <i>her</i> apartment.

341
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:12,500
No reason staying in the same building
paying two rents,

342
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,600
Giving her the key
was your first mistake.

343
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,500
Woman could burn.

344
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,800
She made an omelet with salami,
onions, and peppercinis.

345
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,900
Probably making one
right now for some other guy.

346
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,400
I'm not going there.

347
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,500
You're not going
home, either.

348
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,600
Exactly why you need
a plan of action.

349
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,500
Got a hit on
Roy's name.

350
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,200
Turns out he's got
an FBI number.

351
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,600
So, our boy, Roy,
wasn't so squeaky-clean.

352
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,700
Number was generated
out of New York State in '57.

353
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,000
Any indication of the crime ?

354
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,400
Haven't digitized records
that far back yet.

355
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,200
Request a hand search ?

356
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,500
Hurry up and wait.

357
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,700
Lilly ?

358
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,200
You all right ?

359
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,200
She's dead.

360
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,800
My mother.

361
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,500
You asked how she was and...

362
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,100
I'm sorry.

363
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,800
Lilly, I'm...

364
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,100
Thought you might
want to know.

365
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,100
What happened ?

366
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,100
Cirrhosis.

367
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,500
Year and a half ago.

368
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,800
Never stopped drinking.

369
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,100
All those years.

370
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,200
Tried to get
her to stop.

371
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,300
She hid bottles.

372
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,300
Disappeared for days.

373
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,800
It was her cross.

374
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
She was staying
with me.

375
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,200
She just gave in to it.

376
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,000
And I let her.

377
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,600
All I could do was watch.

378
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,000
Wasn't your fault, Lilly.

379
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,300
Sorry you had to go
through that alone.

380
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,500
Somebody had to.

381
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,200
Your mother and I...

382
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,100
we, uh...

383
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,700
Sometimes it's better
when people don't stay together.

384
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,500
Where is she ?

385
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,900
Saint Anne's.

386
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,300
Traffic was bad.

387
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,100
I didn't have any trouble.

388
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,700
Okay, let's do this.

389
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,300
Made that myself.
It's called the...

390
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,400
Crazy X.

391
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,000
Looks easy enough.

392
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,900
Oh, no.

393
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,400
That's a real stumper.

394
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,900
We're here
about Roy Dunn.

395
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,200
That, uh, salesman
that turned up ?

396
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,100
Shame they're taking out the park
and putting in more houses.

397
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,400
You purchase Sampson
products from him ?

398
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,600
Once.

399
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,100
Stuff was all overpriced.

400
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,100
Where are my manners ?

401
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,400
Would anybody like
something to drink ?

402
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,100
A soda,
glass of wine ?

403
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,000
Honey, it's 3:00.

404
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,900
Oh, um, I'll make
some coffee.

405
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,100
Um, I'll help.

406
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,500
It won't take long.

407
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,600
Uh, Glenn got this new machine.

408
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,300
Beans to brew
in five minutes.

409
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,400
Want to tell us about
the argument you had with Roy ?

410
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,900
Didn't like Roy with your wife
when you were at work.

411
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,300
Actually, it had to do
with my son, Kevin.

412
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,700
You're gonna have
to be more specific, Glenn.

413
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,500
Kevin was having trouble
at school.

414
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,200
Moody, getting in fights and...

415
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,600
Roy have something
to do with that ?

416
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,000
I had a bad feeling
about the gu

417
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,800
Just wasn't right.

418
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:02,200
35-year-old bachelor spending time
with a 15-year-old kid.

419
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:05,201
<i>"Let it out"
by The Hombre.</i>

420
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,600
You're dropping
your elbow.

421
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,100
Use your legs.

422
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,000
Were you good enough
to play in the big leagues ?

423
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,300
At one time.

424
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,500
I knew it.

425
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,300
I was your age,

426
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,300
used to play all day
just to get out of the house.

427
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,200
What do you mean ?

428
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,800
My house wasn't a place
you wanted to be.

429
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,800
Kevin !

430
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,800
Get in the car, son.

431
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
I didn't mean...

432
00:22:29,801 --> 00:22:32,401
You are not allowed in the park
without permission.

433
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,400
What do you think you're doing ?

434
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,800
Just showing him some pitches.

435
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,600
Kid's got a hell of an arm.

436
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,700
I thought I made
myself clear.

437
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,200
I don't want you
around my family.

438
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,000
Look, I didn't mean any...

439
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,800
No, you look.

440
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,400
I catch you hanging
around Kevin again,

441
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,100
I'll call the cops.

442
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,800
Sorry.

443
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,100
It won't happen again.

444
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,400
I didn't like the way
he looked at me.

445
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,500
I didn't like he was
spending time with my son.

446
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,900
So, I called the police.

447
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,200
They share your concerns ?

448
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,300
They said there just
wasn't much they could do

449
00:23:13,301 --> 00:23:15,501
unless this Roy did something.

450
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,400
You take matters
into your own hands ?

451
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
No.

452
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,100
But one night I was coming home
from work and I saw him

453
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,300
<i>standing outside</i>
<i>this woman's house.</i>

454
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,400
I mean, there he was just...

455
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,300
lurking around
some other family.

456
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,400
Where was this ?

457
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,500
Kettle Street.

458
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,400
It's on the other
side of the park.

459
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,400
The guy was up to no good.

460
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,300
I was just trying
to protect my family.

461
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,600
Understandable.

462
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,700
We're gonna need
a number for Kevin.

463
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,400
Oh, sure thing.

464
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,400
Here's one.

465
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,500
"Free rent in exchange
for light clerical

466
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:11,201
and a weekly massage."

467
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,000
I better call on
that one right away.

468
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,900
For somebody out there,
that's the perfect arrangement.

469
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,200
Not this cowboy.

470
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,400
Just got Roy's jacket
from the FBI.

471
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,000
Manslaughter ?

472
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Did seven years in Sing Sing.

473
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,100
Killed a guy named Jim Mills
in a bar fight in Albany.

474
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,300
Check out the name
of his widow.

475
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,200
Alice Mills.

476
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,900
Same Alice on the envelope
we found in Roy's book?

477
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,200
Lives right here in Philly.

478
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,100
Kettle Street.

479
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,500
Six blocks from the park.

480
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,100
Same place Glenn Drew
saw Roy watching that woman.

481
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,900
Looks like Roy had a past.

482
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,300
And it caught up to him
with a vengeance.

483
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,600
Of course I remember Roy Dunn.

484
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,000
How could I not ?

485
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,600
When was the last time
you saw him, Alice ?

486
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,800
Why are you asking me
about Roy ?

487
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,800
'Cause we found his body
six blocks from your old house.

488
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,300
Roy killed
your husband
in a bar fight back in Albany.

489
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,300
I lived through it, Detective.

490
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,700
I know what happened.
He made you a widow.

491
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,100
Served his time, then he
follows you down here ?

492
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,300
Fill in the blanks for us, Alice.

493
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,000
We found this in Roy's notebook.

494
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,800
Maybe you can shed some light
on what the money was for.

495
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:37,000
Look, Roy and my husband were
teammates on the Albany Senators.

496
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,200
Minor league baseball.

497
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,100
Roy's curve ball was good enough
for the majors.

498
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,700
Jim's talent
was drinking too much

499
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,200
and taking it out on the one person
who wouldn't fight back.

500
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,500
He hit you ?

501
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,600
Yes.

502
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,900
Roy took offense.

503
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,900
He saw me
with a black eye.

504
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,900
Told Jim if he laid another hand
on me,

505
00:25:57,901 --> 00:25:59,401
he'd be sorry.

506
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,700
Roy swung first ?

507
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,900
That's what the witnesses said.

508
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,500
After the trial,
my son and I moved to Philly.

509
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,300
Then, out of the blue,

510
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:15,100
these envelopes
filled with money
would show up in my mailbox.

511
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,700
Roy ?

512
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,900
What are you doing ?

513
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,100
- Nothing, I...
- Roy, please, wait !

514
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,800
I want to talk to you.

515
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,200
Sorry, I shouldn't be here.

516
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,700
I just want to help.

517
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,300
By sneaking around
and leaving money ?

518
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,800
For what I did to you.

519
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,700
I shouldn't have
gotten involved.

520
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,600
Everybody knew
what Jimmy was doing

521
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,600
and they all chose
to look the other way.

522
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,700
I couldn't do that.

523
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,900
And I should've walked away
the first time he hit me.

524
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,300
He didn't deserve you.

525
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,200
That's in the past now, Roy.

526
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,300
I don't blame you.

527
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:20,200
I spent every day in that cell
thinking about what I'd done to you.

528
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,600
Should've just walked away.

529
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,100
You're not
the walking-away kind.

530
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,100
I know.

531
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,700
Sometimes I wish I could be.

532
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,300
Did he say
anything else that day ?

533
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:42,000
No, we just talked
about his job.

534
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,100
But I thought
there was something

535
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:47,200
about one of those houses
that was eating at him.

536
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,400
You ask him about it ?

537
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,800
Said he had a clear view
of things.

538
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,800
I thought he was talking
about a woman.

539
00:27:54,800 --> 00:28:00,100
But I got a sense that
there was more to it.

540
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,000
Hello, Diane.

541
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,800
Oh, excuse me.

542
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,500
On sale.

543
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,300
Hmm, mother's little helper.

544
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,700
- I'm sorry ?
- The phone number

545
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,400
you gave us for your son,
Kevin, didn't work.

546
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,000
Turns out
he moved.

547
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,600
Two years ago.

548
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,500
Oh, Glenn must've given you
the old number.

549
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,600
Sure, I just thought
maybe you had a falling out.

550
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,100
You still talk with your son ?

551
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,100
My husband already answered
your questions.

552
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,400
But you didn't.

553
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,400
Made sure you were out of the room
while he answered for you.

554
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,900
What's this all about ?

555
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,800
You and Roy.

556
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,400
Glenn tell you to lie ?

557
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,900
What are you insinuating ?

558
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,800
Glenn's a pretty
controlling guy.

559
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,100
Seen a few of his type
in my day.

560
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,100
That how you cope with it?

561
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,400
Glenn is a very good man.

562
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,300
But Roy...

563
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,100
Something you want
to tell me, Diane ?

564
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,100
You weren't alone.

565
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,200
Just lonely.

566
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,900
- No, please !
- Can't say I blame you,

567
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,300
husband like Glenn.

568
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,600
But if he found out
that you were having
an affair...

569
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,800
It wasn't an affair.

570
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,300
It wasn't anything.

571
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,800
Diane.

572
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,400
I want to help you.

573
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,000
It's...

574
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,200
It's Glenn.

575
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,900
He's not at work
when he says he is

576
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:12,300
and when I ask him   about it, he lies to me.

577
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,700
When he's home,
it's even worse.

578
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,400
It doesn't get any better.

579
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,500
I'm just...

580
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,900
I'm so tired of pretending that
everything is perfect when it's not.

581
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,300
It's what people do here.

582
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,200
I see it every day.

583
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,900
You could leave.

584
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:51,300
No, no, I can't leave.

585
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,500
That would, uh...

586
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,200
that would be impossible, Roy.

587
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,100
Is it ?

588
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,100
Mom ?

589
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,200
No, Kevin !

590
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,500
Kevin, wait !

591
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,100
Letting Kevin see me
with Roy like that

592
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,300
was the biggest mistake
of my life.

593
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,300
What did Roy do after that ?

594
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,900
He went to find Kevin.

595
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,500
Did you see Roy after that ?

596
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,800
No, I assumed he did
the gentlemanly thing

597
00:31:21,801 --> 00:31:23,701
and transferred routes.

598
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:28,600
You blame that on Kevin,
seeing you with Roy ?

599
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,200
The only thing that mattered
was my son.

600
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,800
And I felt like
I lost him that day.

601
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,400
Where is he now ?

602
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,600
I wish I knew.

603
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,800
Got a line on Kevin.
Lives outside of Scranton.

604
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,900
Jeffries is bringing him in.

605
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,000
Diane says her son
caught her with Roy.

606
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,400
Wasn't too happy about it.

607
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,000
Around the same time
Roy disappeared.

608
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,200
His folks finally just shipped him off
to Valley Forge.

609
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,300
Military school ?

610
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,800
During the Vietnam War?

611
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,300
One way to straighten out
a mixed-up kid.

612
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,000
Or get rid of a big problem.

613
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,300
Parents had good timing, Kevin.

614
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,100
Sent you to military academy at
the height of the Vietnam War.

615
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:22,500
Push-ups and screaming
might work for some kids.

616
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,200
Not me.

617
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,800
I... I ditched that place.

618
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,300
And before that, public school.

619
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,500
A school nurse sent you home
with a broken wrist

620
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,100
end of your
sophomore year.

621
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,600
June 7, 1967.

622
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,300
Day after,

623
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,700
Roy Dunn disappeared.

624
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,900
Roy Dunn ?

625
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,400
Door-to-door
salesman.

626
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,500
You remember.
Used to play ball with him.

627
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,300
Yeah, maybe I did.

628
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,700
What's one got to do
with the other?

629
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:55,700
How did you break
your wrist, Kevin ?

630
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,500
I don't know.

631
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,200
I got in a lot of fights
back then.

632
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,500
Roy one of 'em ?

633
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,400
I never had a problem with Roy.

634
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,100
No ?

635
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,700
Not even after you saw him
with your mother ?

636
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,700
We spoke to her.

637
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,700
Said you were pretty upset
about what you saw.

638
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,300
Leave her out of this.

639
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,100
All of sudden ?

640
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,200
She's my mother.

641
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,600
When's the last time
you called her ?

642
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,300
What is this ?

643
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,500
Must have had
a good reason

644
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,800
to cut her out of your life
like that.

645
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,700
Like seeing her
with another guy ?

646
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:29,300
Still disgusts you to think
she was unfaiful to your father.

647
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,900
You got it all wrong.

648
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,400
Used to lift weights,
Kevin?

649
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,600
I look like I lift weights?

650
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,900
Past has a way
of getting dredged up.

651
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:43,100
Just like a body in the bottom
of a pond in a park.

652
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,900
Where you two used to play.

653
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,100
I did see Roy
that day I got hurt,

654
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:52,500
but it wasn't 'cause of him.

655
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,500
I was already a mess.

656
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:59,200
You don't know what it was like
living in the middle of that.

657
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,500
Kevin.

658
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,300
Kevin...

659
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,100
please.

660
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,600
What you saw....

661
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,200
What, what happened to you ?

662
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,400
Did you get into a fight
at school ?

663
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,300
No.

664
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,200
Let me see.

665
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,700
Who did this to you ?

666
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,700
It was your father, wasn't it ?

667
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,100
Why ?

668
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,100
I can't.

669
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:49,300
You told your father
about Roy and your mom

670
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,600
and he took it out
on the messenger.

671
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,800
Then he went after Roy ?

672
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,200
No. That's not
what happened.

673
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,600
Then what did happen, Kev ?!

674
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,800
Nick, uh, why don't you go
get Kevin a soda ?

675
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,400
42 years is a long time
to keep a secret.

676
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,000
I didn't know Roy was dead.

677
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,500
What'd you tell him that day ?

678
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,500
He wanted to...

679
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,600
...know why my dad hit me.

680
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,900
Why, Kevin ?

681
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,200
Because of what I saw.

682
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,400
Dad ?

683
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,900
I'll never forget that look
on his face.

684
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,800
You know, he...

685
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,600
I thought I did something wrong.

686
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,400
He made you think that.

687
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,300
Old man, he...

688
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:26,000
he chased me down,
gave me the beating of my life.

689
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,600
He threatened worse
if I said a word to anybody.

690
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,400
But you told Roy.

691
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,700
Roy went to confront
your father.

692
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,300
A part of me...

693
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,300
wanted him to...

694
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:46,300
take me and my mother
out of that house.

695
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,400
All she put up with.

696
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,800
Well...

697
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,400
some people shouldn't stay
together.

698
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,200
Took me a long time
to figure that out.

699
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,100
Still my dad though, you know ?

700
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,800
Nice setup you got
here, Glenn.

701
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,700
Why don't you put the tools down
and step away from the bench.

702
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,900
What's going on here ?

703
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,100
- Did Diane let you in ?
- You're a real handy guy.

704
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,900
Kept it together
all these years.

705
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,000
Kept what together,
Detective ?

706
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,500
Appearances.

707
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,500
Why Diane needs a bottle of wine
to make it through the day.

708
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,000
I don't have to stand
here, listen to this.

709
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,800
You got something you want
to ask me about, ask it.

710
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,400
How 'bout that bunk
you fed us

711
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,700
about being the good father,

712
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,700
protecting your
family from Roy.

713
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,100
It's a real stumper, Glenn.

714
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,600
I'd like you to leave now.

715
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,700
You couldn't be happy,
so neither could anyone else.

716
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,100
Smacking your
wife around,

717
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,700
- beating your kid.
- I never laid a hand on them.

718
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,100
Not what Kevin
told us.

719
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,600
But Roy knew
what you did to him.

720
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,100
And why.

721
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,700
You still hitting the park
after hours, Glenn ?

722
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,500
You got too old for that ?

723
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,700
Or maybe you got a toe-tapping thing
going at the airport

724
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,400
This is ridiculous.

725
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,000
- I'm not the criminal here...
- We're cops, Glenn.

726
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,500
You don't think we know

727
00:38:17,501 --> 00:38:21,401
what all the loitering tickets
at Judy Garland Park mean ?

728
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,200
You're, you're twisting things
around.

729
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,000
You did a pretty
good job of that yourself.

730
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,800
But Roy could tell.
He had that eye.

731
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,900
Saw right through you.

732
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,000
Confronted you.

733
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,200
But you couldn't handle it.

734
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,000
Made Roy out to be the monster,
but it was you.

735
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,400
Wasn't it, Glenn ?

736
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,500
He had no right.

737
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,100
Was still my house.

738
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,400
My house ! My family !

739
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,100
I was a good father.

740
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,500
I saw Kevin.

741
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,800
Get the hell out of here.

742
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,900
I'm not going
anywhere.

743
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,100
You're trespassing.

744
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,500
- You want me to call the police ?
- Go ahead.

745
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,200
They might like to hear
what you did to Kevin.

746
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,600
What are you talking about ?

747
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,400
Shouldn't hit him, Glenn.

748
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,900
Kevin is all mixed up.

749
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,500
That why you busted his arm ?

750
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,400
I went away for a long time,
Glenn.

751
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,300
Learned to keep my mouth shut
and look the other way.

752
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,900
I'm done doing that now.

753
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,500
And you're
done bullying Kevin and Diane.

754
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,900
Who the hell are you to tell me
how to run my family ?

755
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,000
Some nobody
salesman.

756
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,900
It's over, Glenn.

757
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,900
I know
about the park.

758
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,700
What ? You don't know
what you're talking about.

759
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,500
Can't even admit who you are
so you take it out on them.

760
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,200
You shut your mouth.

761
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,700
You need to leave, Glenn,
right now.

762
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,800
Let Diane
and Kevin live their lives.

763
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:15,300
I will do no such thing.

764
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,600
You don't deserve them.

765
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:59,199
