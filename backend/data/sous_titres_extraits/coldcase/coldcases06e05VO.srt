1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,800
Hep, hup! Hep, hup! Hep, hup!

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,600
SEPTEMBER 8, 1951

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,200
<i>"Sound off"
by Vaughn Monroe.</i>

4
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,700
Swabbie's got a head
like a '49 Ford.

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,400
Come on, Tully.

6
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,100
Last round-- you gotta knock
this anchor clanker out !

7
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,600
You got to wear him down,
Tully-- you're a Marine.

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,300
Go get him in
this round, Tully.

9
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,400
Listen up, Marines !

10
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,300
Shore leave commences at 1300.

11
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,600
As Marines, you will
conduct yourself with honor,

12
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,900
valor, and fidelity.

13
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,400
Outstanding job,
PFC Tully.

14
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,400
Private First Class Snow,
what in Sam Hill is this ?!

15
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,100
Sir, it won't stay bloused, sir !

16
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,200
It won't stay bloused
because you do not belong

17
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,000
in my beloved Corps !

18
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,100
I suggest you unscrew
yourself ASAP!

19
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,300
Well, any day, sweetheart !

20
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,200
Sir, yes, sir !

21
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,300
PFC Tully,

22
00:02:05,301 --> 00:02:07,701
tell me why I should not cancel
liberty for all hands

23
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,800
because of PFC Snowball's
personal appearance ?!

24
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,600
Sir, PFC Snow will
square himself away !

25
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,800
Marines take care of their own !
That is our code, Sergeant !

26
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,200
Outstanding answer, PFC Tully!

27
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,600
Stand by !

28
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,100
Platoon, dismissed !

29
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,700
Aye, aye, Sergeant !

30
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,500
Do it !

31
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,300
I love the smell
of toxic waste in the morning.

32
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,100
You want to watch
your step.

33
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,200
The place is full of stuff that'll eat your
Florsheims for breakfast.

34
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,500
What do we have ?

35
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,400
A land test on a real estate deal

36
00:03:19,401 --> 00:03:21,601
turned up toxic levels
of you-name-it.

37
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,400
EPA clean-up crew found
the remains inside.

38
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,600
It was an adult male
shot in the head.

39
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,100
M.E. tech ballparks it
at .38 caliber.

40
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,900
- How long has it been here ?
- Agency says the land

41
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,500
hasn't been used as
a legal dump site in over 50 years.

42
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,300
We need to find out
who had access--

43
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,400
permission
to dump here.

44
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,700
That ought to be fun.

45
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,400
EPA's lawyers have been trying
to sort that out for years.

46
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,100
What's that ?
Dog tags ?

47
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,500
"Tully, James, C. USMC."

48
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,000
Looks like we just found
a lost Marine.

49
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:06,600
COLD CASE
6x05

50
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:15,500
Transcript VO : www.ragbear.com

51
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:21,501
Shore leave

52
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,900
Marine private first class
James C. Tully,

53
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,100
Accused of desertion,
September 9, 1951.

54
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,300
Stationed aboard
the USS Pronto,

55
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,400
on his way to do
battle in Korea.

56
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,900
The forgotten war.

57
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,400
Disappeared
during liberty.

58
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,800
He was supposed to be
back on the Pronto

59
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,500
morning of September 9,
at 0600 hours.

60
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,700
He never showed.

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,300
I think we know why.

62
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,300
The kid was only 17 years old.

63
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,900
Got into some kind of trouble.

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,700
On liberty, that's no surprise.

65
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,200
Drinking, shenanigans.

66
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,600
The last hoorah.

67
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Trying to get in as much
living as possible.

68
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,100
Pretty high casualty
rate in Korea.

69
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,700
Maybe he gets
cold feet ?

70
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,100
Ah, not likely.

71
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,800
Marines aren't drafted.
They enlist or volunteer.

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,100
Docks have always been
a dangerous place.

73
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,400
He gets separated from
his fellow Marines,

74
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,700
and runs into some
local riffraff ?

75
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,900
The guys in his platoon
might know something.

76
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,700
Yeah, if we can
track them down.

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,100
Well, brother Steve Tully's

78
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:29,501
on his way to Philly
to claim the remains...

79
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,700
a decorated Marine
in Vietnam himself.

80
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,800
The father served
in World War II.

81
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,100
Whole family
of military men.

82
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,200
Must have been
a real disgrace--

83
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,600
Tully accused
of being a deserter.

84
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,300
The family
never believed it.

85
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,800
Sent the Naval Board
of Corrections

86
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,300
countless letters refuting
the unauthorized absence charge.

87
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,300
To no avail.

88
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,000
Trying to reverse a charge
like that  with the military bureaucracy

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,700
is like getting a battleship
to reverse course--

90
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,700
slow and unlikely to happen.

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,500
It's our job to see this Marine
gets his honor back.

92
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,000
Hey, what the...?

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,100
That's for aiding and abetting

94
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,400
in a decapitation of
my best tie last week.

95
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,900
What makes you think
I had anything to do

96
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,900
- with that... incident ?
- Oh, don't worry.

97
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,800
Your little partner
in crime, La Bamba.

98
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,400
he's gonna get his, too.

99
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,900
What up, fellas ?

100
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,700
You tell me, Scotty.

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,900
ASK ME ABOUT ERECTILE.
DYSFUNCTION

102
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,700
My father went to his grave
wondering if Jimmy was a coward.

103
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,900
He fought the
desertion ruling.

104
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,900
He must have known different
in his heart.

105
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,900
Said it wasn't
in Jimmy's DNA to desert.

106
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,900
But he still wanted the flag
to prove it.

107
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,400
My brother never backed down
from a fight in his life.

108
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,300
Wondering if you
can tell us anything

109
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,200
about Jimmy... might help us
with our investigation.

110
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,100
Oh, yeah...
brought this postcard he sent us.

111
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,600
It's the last time
we heard from him.

112
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,600
"Our sergeant granted us
a liberty pass."

113
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
"Me and a couple guys
from the platoon  are gonna hit the town."

114
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,700
You know who his friends were ?

115
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,200
No, I was just a kid
when he left for boot camp.

116
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,100
Gave me his baseball glove.

117
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,600
Told me to keep it oiled
for him.

118
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,900
Promised to teach me
his curve ball when he got back.

119
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,100
Card's postmarked
the day he disappeared.

120
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,700
I slept with it under
my pillow for years,

121
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,200
just thinking it
would bring him back.

122
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,000
What about his pocket watch ?

123
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,300
Didn't they find it
with his, you know...

124
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,000
Pocket watch ? No.

125
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,600
Oh, it definitely would
have been on him.

126
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,900
He treasured that watch.

127
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,500
Robbery gone bad ?

128
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,800
My father told him it was his duty

129
00:07:58,001 --> 00:07:59,601
to bring the watch back safe

130
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,500
and pass it on
to his own son someday.

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,700
Never even made it
out of Philly.

132
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,300
Sergeant Chaney,
they said we could find you here.

133
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,600
I volunteer twice a week
and school some of these men

134
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,200
in checkers, just
to let them know

135
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,700
that their sacrifice
still means something.

136
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:29,600
Wondering what you remember about
Private First Class Jimmy Tully.

137
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,300
One of nine guys that went
to Korea came back

138
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,300
in a body bag,
and you're asking me

139
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,700
about a coward that went AWOL ?

140
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,600
You were
his platoon sergeant, right ?

141
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,000
That type of behavior fit ?

142
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,800
Well, the kid
was a hell of a boxer.

143
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,500
He beat the tar out of
the Navy's best puncher

144
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,900
the day of
shore leave,

145
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,000
but there's a hell
of a difference

146
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,500
between taking a punch
and staring down enemy fire.

147
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,700
His body turned up yesterday.

148
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,700
We think he got killed
on shore leave.

149
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,300
Anyone in his platoon
have a problem with him ?

150
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,400
Whoa. If Tully was killed,

151
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,100
it wasn't by another Marine.

152
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,300
Any idea which
of his friends

153
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,700
he might have hit Philly with ?

154
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,900
Yeah, there was a guy
named Max, um...

155
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,900
Max Heid... Heidhorn...
Heidhorn, yeah.

156
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,200
He was a real clown.

157
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,500
We'll look into it.

158
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,100
Hey, detectives...

159
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,300
If a guy doesn't come back
to the ship,

160
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,800
I have no other choice  but to declare
him a deserter.

161
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,500
Max Heidhorn ?

162
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,500
Detectives Rush, Miller.

163
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,600
Thanks
for coming in.

164
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,300
A fan of the ponies ?

165
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,800
I like to lay a few bets

166
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,900
here and there,
keep things interesting.

167
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,700
You got a system ?

168
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,700
Yeah.

169
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,000
It's called
"Win some, lose some."

170
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,400
But you didn't
ask me down here

171
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,200
to pick up tips
on the sport of kings.

172
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Understand you
and Jimmy Tully were friends.

173
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,200
Sure were.

174
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,800
We survived boot camp together.

175
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,300
Were you with him
on shore leave ?

176
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,500
Me and about 500 other Marines
and sailors.

177
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,600
When's the last time
you saw him ?

178
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,800
That'd be hard to forget.

179
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,700
Hey, Tully, get in line.

180
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,800
All right, come on,
I'm buying.

181
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,800
Get an anchor and globe
or, uh, maybe one  of them hula girls.

182
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,000
I ain't got
time, Max.

183
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,500
<i>"If you turn me down"
par Peggy Lee.</i>

184
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,600
Those Navy squids
don't do so well on land.

185
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:22,401
I'll say.

186
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,600
Valentine red.

187
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,200
Color of your lips.

188
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,800
Thanks.

189
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,500
Gotta dash.

190
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,600
Hey, Tully.

191
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,000
What the hell you gawking at ?

192
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,600
See that ?

193
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,700
Yeah, I sure did.

194
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,400
Another barnacle looking
to latch onto some sailor.

195
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,100
GUNWALE
Man, the girls I told you about at this place

196
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,100
do a whole lot more
than just look, baby.

197
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,000
You coming ?

198
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
What, are you kidding ?

199
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,700
Just met the girl of my dreams.

200
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,700
Hey, anybody want to see
the Liberty Bell with me ?

201
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,900
Yeah... dumbbell
meets Liberty Bell.

202
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,800
Take it easy on the kid, Max.

203
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,300
You know, good thing
you got old Tully here

204
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,600
always sticking up
for you, Snowball.

205
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,700
Maybe he can, um, chaperone
your little sightseeing tour.

206
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,900
I'm going across
the street.

207
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,700
Hey, no, no,

208
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,300
that's a Navy bar.

209
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
Karnow's got to be sore
about you beating him.

210
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,700
Yeah, well, I beat him
fair and square.

211
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Where I'm going,

212
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,200
at least you won't have to fight
sailors off just to get a dance.

213
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,000
You know where
to find me, Punchy.

214
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,800
Roger that, Devil Dog.

215
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,200
Tattoo was the last thing
I remember about shore leave.

216
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,300
Almost didn't make it back
to the ship  due to the whiskey...

217
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,200
and a redheaded girl.

218
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,300
This Karnow,
he and Tully have a history ?

219
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,000
"Mean Gene" Karnow...

220
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,900
Tully gave that bastard a really
good pasting at a smoker right before

221
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,600
we got our liberty passes.

222
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,800
Fight over what ?

223
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,700
Boxing match over
bragging rights.

224
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,400
Tully always took that
Semper Fi, "always faithful"

225
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,200
business seriously.

226
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,500
Me, on the other hand...

227
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,500
Karnow the type
to hold a grudge ?

228
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,400
Well, first off,
he was a Swabbie.

229
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,500
No love lost
between Marines and sailors.

230
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,800
Gene Karnow ?

231
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,500
Take it easy
there, Dragnet.

232
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,600
You guys looking for lessons ?

233
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,000
We're here about
Jimmy Tully.

234
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,500
What's he want, a rematch ?

235
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,800
- He's dead.
- Killed on shore leave

236
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,400
- the night he knocked you out.
- How'd that happen ?

237
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,900
- We were just about to ask you
the same question.
- You think

238
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,400
I killed him because he got over
a few lucky punches ?

239
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,600
So no hard feelings
between you and Tully ?

240
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,800
Hell, that match with Tully
and me on board ship,

241
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,700
that was my last fight.

242
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,000
Boiler blew up on
the way to Korea,

243
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,400
and drove a six-inch piece
of steel into my shoulder.

244
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,500
Jab wasn't much good
after that.

245
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,500
- You see Tully that night ?
- Yeah.

246
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,500
Sure.

247
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,800
Guy had brass ones,

248
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,401
walking into a Navy bar.

249
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,500
<i>"Yeah, yeah, yeah"
by Keely Smith and Louis Prima.</i>

250
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,900
You got lucky, jarhead.

251
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,300
Look, I don't want
any trouble.

252
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,300
What do you want then ?

253
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,600
A dance.

254
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,200
Good luck and good night.

255
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,900
She's shot down
every sailor in here,

256
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,900
including yours truly.

257
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,200
I'll take my chances.

258
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,100
You lost this.

259
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,200
"Brown, Sanford and Mullins,

260
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,500
Attorneys at Law."

261
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
So which one are you ?

262
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,700
I'm just a stenographer
right now.

263
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,600
Tomorrow's my first
day on the job.

264
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,700
But someday I'm gonna have
my own card just like that.

265
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,700
I'd offer to buy
you a drink,

266
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,100
but it looks like you're doing just fine
in that department.

267
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,200
You wanna buy me a drink,
you gotta get in line.

268
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,800
The sailor at the
end of the bar says

269
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,200
you're the toughest
thing in here.

270
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,400
Think he might've been right.

271
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,900
I thought Marines
were supposed to be brave.

272
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:32,000
A good Marine must
improvise, adapt and overcome.

273
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,600
Is that why
you're in a Navy bar ?

274
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,000
The one thing I swore I'd do before I
shipped off was dance with a pretty girl.

275
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,700
Is that where I come in ?

276
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,800
Affirmative.

277
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,500
All right, but I don't dance
with strangers.

278
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,300
Jimmy Tully,
Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania.

279
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,200
Nora Lee,
Philadelphia born and bred.

280
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,500
Miss Nora Lee
from Philadelphia born and bred,

281
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,200
would you care to dance ?

282
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,400
Why don't you drop anchor
someplace else ?

283
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,100
- You got a problem, pal ?
- Besides you guys

284
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,700
taking over our bars
and bird-dogging our women ?

285
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,800
Not tonight.

286
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,400
You better have a lot
of bullets in that gun.

287
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,700
Never thought I'd be
defending a jarhead's right

288
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,500
to dance with the prettiest
girl in the bar.

289
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,900
This tough guy,
he got a name ?

290
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,200
Nah, didn't bother asking.

291
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,600
Introduced him
to the sidewalk pretty good.

292
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,100
Well, maybe he waited around
outside for Tully.

293
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,700
I couldn't tell you,
because the second

294
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,800
prettiest girl in the bar
was so impressed

295
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,500
with my bravery,
she asked me to dance.

296
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,900
Been together 55 years.

297
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,500
You remember anything else
about this guy ?

298
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:53,300
Yeah, had a dock workers'
union patch on his jacket.

299
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,600
That's a funny
thing to remember.

300
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,000
I was a snipe, you know,
an engine room rat.

301
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,900
I had to deal with sandcrabs
like that all the time.

302
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,900
Thanks for your time.

303
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,600
You know,
if you ever want some lessons,

304
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
come on down

305
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,700
and we'll lace 'em up, okay ?

306
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,400
My partner needs more
than that.

307
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,700
You're what,

308
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,900
50 push-ups
from the cover of GQ ?

309
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,300
I wouldn't be so sure about that, big fella.

310
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,400
I could teach him something that'd wipe
that smirk right off your face.

311
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,000
Oh... no offense, Detective.

312
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,800
Come on, come on,
give me some.

313
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,000
Come on.

314
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,200
Gunwale, your old haunts ?

315
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,500
Navy bar-- tied
a few on here.

316
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,500
Some things never change.

317
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,400
I'll bet she still remembers
what I drink.

318
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
John...

319
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,100
long time no see.

320
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,000
Irish whiskey and a beer back ?

321
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,100
On duty.

322
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,700
This is Detective Rush.

323
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,000
Hey.

324
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,400
We're wondering
if you remember Jimmy Tully.

325
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,200
Marine back in '51.

326
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,200
I'm good, sugar,
but I'm not that good.

327
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,400
Witness said he had words over
a girl with a local tough guy.

328
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,500
In the Gunwale ?
Imagine that.

329
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,000
That tough guy wore
a dock workers' union patch

330
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,200
on his jacket.

331
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,600
Flashed a gun.

332
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,200
Could be Ray Lisi.

333
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,200
Hall of fame jackass.

334
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,100
86'd him from the Gunwale,
oh, a decade ago.

335
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,400
He ever do time ?

336
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,100
He did a good stretch
at Frackville,

337
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,500
for beating a union scab.

338
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,200
The guy's sucking his meals down
through a straw now.

339
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,600
Where's Lisi
park it these days ?

340
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,500
Over at Ruby's with the rest
of his old dock buddies.

341
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,300
Probably already
got his drunk on.

342
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,700
And he likes cops even less than Marines.

343
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,100
We'll keep that in mind.

344
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,100
- Thanks, Sue.
- Okay.

345
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,500
Hey...

346
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,200
he tries to throw a bottle
at you, like he did me...

347
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,100
We'll return the favor.

348
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,400
some headway on the oil drum
Tully was found in.

349
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,300
What do you got ?

350
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,700
List of about 50 entities
that could've dumped there.

351
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,200
Of the most interest,
the Navy and the shipyard.

352
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,200
- Oil drum could have come off a ship.
- Yep.

353
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,600
Check naval base records.

354
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,100
When I served, the military
kept a paper trail a mile long

355
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,000
for every belt buckle,
bullet and mess kit.

356
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,200
Oh, joy.

357
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,300
Oh, so where's this
old dock worker ?

358
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,300
I hear he took a swing at the cop
that picked him up.

359
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,400
Ray Lisi ?

360
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,200
Scotty's got him
in the box now.

361
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,100
I'm gonna make you
pick up after yourself, Ray.

362
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,400
You mind telling me
what this is all about, junior ?

363
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,800
Sure, pops.

364
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,600
Either you tell me about the last time
you saw Jimmy Tully,

365
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,300
or I lock you up
for taking a swing at that cop.

366
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,400
Jimmy who ?

367
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,900
We got an eyewitness
says you flashed a gun at him.

368
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,800
- Oh, that's interesting.
- It gets better, see,

369
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,300
'cause this Marine got shot.

370
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,500
Well, isn't that
what they sign up for ?

371
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,700
Pulled your sheet.

372
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,300
You beat a guy
with a .38

373
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,400
not long after Tully
disappeared.

374
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,200
It's the same caliber
killed Tully.

375
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,400
Guy was a scab.
He kept falling on my gun.

376
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,600
Lucky I didn't
pull the trigger.

377
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,200
Well, you couldn't beat Tully,
so you shot him.

378
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,300
Keep trawling.

379
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm done with you, Ray.

380
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,900
Either you talk   or a few friends
of that cop you swung at

381
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,100
are gonna come in here
and tuck you in for the night.

382
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,900
Lucky bastard was doing
just fine when I left him.

383
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,500
<i>"Go, man, go"
by Melvin "Sy" Oliver.</i>

384
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,000
Greatest city in the world.

385
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:25,601
Lot of guys on the ship
are from Philly.

386
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,500
Maybe I'll make it
my home someday, too.

387
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,000
It's already 10:00.

388
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,300
I'm sorry, I'm keeping you
with your big first day tomorrow.

389
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,700
My friend dragged me
along with her,

390
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,000
and I wasn't expecting
to meet someone like you.

391
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,300
I know, me neither.

392
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,800
We got those clumsy sailors
to thank for that.

393
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,900
You probably would've found some
other pretty girl to dance with.

394
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,700
But I found you.

395
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,900
What's the matter ?

396
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,700
Aren't you afraid
of going over there ?

397
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,900
Marines aren't supposed
to show fear.

398
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,900
Save the slogans
for your buddies.

399
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,600
I'm serious, Jimmy.

400
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,400
Look, any guy who tells you
he isn't afraid is a liar.

401
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,000
But my father served,
and so did his father.

402
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,600
It's what the men
in my family do.

403
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,500
Hey...

404
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,000
What if I lose you
as soon as I found you ?

405
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,600
I still owe you that dance,
remember ?

406
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,800
Dance marathon ?

407
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,100
Now you're talking.

408
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,200
Marine and fastest typist
in the steno pool ?

409
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,400
We'll be the couple to beat.

410
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,200
Nora !

411
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,100
What is it with this guy ?

412
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,700
He works down at
the docks with my father.

413
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,500
I can handle him.

414
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,900
If he lays one finger on you,

415
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,500
I'm gonna clean his clock.

416
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,700
What're you doing, Ray ?

417
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,000
This guy's not gonna
be here for you like I am.

418
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,700
I appreciate you
looking out for me,

419
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,000
but you need to go home.

420
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,500
Please...

421
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,800
Do it for me.

422
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,900
Oh, I never been much
for that lovey-dovey crud,

423
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,200
but... I think
she was real smitten.

424
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,900
You don't strike me
as the observant type, Ray.

425
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,300
I did not shoot that jarhead.

426
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,800
He embarrassed you
in front of your girl.

427
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,900
She wasn't my girl.

428
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,300
The most she ever did
was let me buy her a drink.

429
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,000
I hope she backs that up.

430
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,700
- Your husband ?
- I lost him ten years ago.

431
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,600
Ben was a good man.
He was there for me.

432
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,400
Don't make men
like they used to.

433
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,600
Was Tully around
when you started dating Ben ?

434
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,900
I know what you're thinking,

435
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,900
but I wasn't
that kind of girl.

436
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,800
I met Ben a year later.

437
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,200
A friend set us up.

438
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,200
That's my son Peter.

439
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,300
Handsome.

440
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,700
I thought you wanted
to ask me about Jimmy Tully.

441
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,800
A guy named Ray Lisi said you were
with Jimmy the night he disappeared.

442
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,400
We met at the Gunwale.

443
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,900
Then hit a dance marathon.

444
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,700
"Marine and fastest typist
in the steno pool."

445
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,900
That's what he said.

446
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,100
- What about after that ?
- After that ?

447
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,500
I would've given him my heart.

448
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,800
But fate wouldn't have it.

449
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,900
THE GOOD LIFE

450
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:31,201
<i>"Mona Lisa"

451
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,300
What ?

452
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,100
Just seeing if your boyfriend
Ray comes out to stop me.

453
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,700
Stop you from what ?

454
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,800
Smuggling you
on the ship.

455
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,600
Come on, I'll buy
you a soda.

456
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,100
- Merci.
- You're welcome. Enjoy.

457
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,900
I sure i am gonna
miss you.

458
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,300
You'll forget what I look like
minute the ship leaves port.

459
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,500
Not if you give me a
photo of yourself.

460
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,299
Do I look like the kind of girl

461
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,800
who carries photos
of herself around ?

462
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,700
Come on, let's fix that.

463
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,900
Come on.

INSTANT PHOTO BOOTH

465
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,000
You're supposed to
look at the camera.

466
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,700
What if I don't want to ?

467
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,900
We're going to have
to keep doing this  until you get it right.

468
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,900
Or we could do this...

469
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,100
Private First Class Tully ?

470
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,500
Yes ?

471
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,200
Need to come with us.

472
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,300
Jimmy ? What's happening ?

473
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,300
I don't know.

474
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
I'll find you.

475
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,000
- That was the last time I saw him.
- What did shore patrol want with Tully ?

476
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I don't know.

477
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,200
He never came back.

478
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,500
Anything else you remember,
give us a call.

479
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,200
Thank you for letting me know
what happened to him.

480
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,100
I only knew Jimmy
for a few hours,

481
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,800
but I never forgot him.

482
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,000
Hey, John,

483
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,800
naval clerk dug up the ship's
disciplinary log book.

484
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,800
Logbook have an entry of
sending out shore patrol ?

485
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,800
Sent to question Tully's
entire platoon.

486
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,000
Log entry said they were looking for
a Private First Class Lenny Snow...

487
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,500
suspected of taking a Navy
officer's pearl-handled .38 revolver.

488
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,900
Could be our
murder weapon.

489
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,600
Gun was never recovered.

490
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,900
Snow spent the crossing
to the Korean Peninsula

491
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,900
below decks in the
ship's brig.

492
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,400
Well, let's put him in our box,
see what is got to say about this gun.

493
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,400
Had a look at your service record.

494
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,900
Navy Cross, Bronze Star.

495
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,300
That's some tour
of duty.

496
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,800
I prefer
not to talk about it.

497
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,000
Why not ?

498
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,700
Did you serve, Detective ?

499
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,100
Navy.

500
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,100
Vietnam ?

501
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,100
River Rat unit.

502
00:25:13,101 --> 00:25:15,601
Then you know a lot of good men
never made it back.

503
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,600
Doesn't seem right to be making a fuss
over a bunch of medals and ribbons.

504
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,200
I did what I had to do.

505
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,600
Others gave more.

506
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,700
You straightened yourself out
after shore leave, though.

507
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,500
I'll admit I wasn't the most squared-away
Marine in my unit.

508
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,800
But I didn't take
that officer's weapon.

509
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,000
Why'd shore patrol
think you did ?

510
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,100
Oh, I got blamed for everything.

511
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,900
Didn't help that Sergeant Chaney
had it in for me.

512
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,200
You see Tully that night
on shore leave ?

513
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,100
Yeah.

514
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,400
Tried to help me out of the
pickle I was in with that gun.

515
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,900
BUS STATION DEPOT

516
00:25:48,901 --> 00:25:52,901
<i>This is the last call
for bus 82-- Pittsburgh...</i>

517
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,900
Where the hell
have you been ?

518
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,900
I been looking all
over town for you.

519
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,400
- I'm in trouble.
- Yeah, I know.

520
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,900
Shore patrol gave me
the third degree about you.

521
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,000
I didn't take that revolver.

522
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,300
You gotta believe me.

523
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,200
Then you better start
convincing me--

524
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,800
'cause I just left
the girl of my dreams.

525
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,300
I don't know what happened.

526
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,900
Sergeant Chaney
had Max and me

527
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,700
on police detail
in officer quarters.

528
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,700
You were with Max ?

529
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,200
You can ask him.

530
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,600
I never even
saw the weapon.

531
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,100
Scout's honor.

532
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,800
You see Max go inside ?

533
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,700
He wanted to see how squared away
an officer kept his rack.

534
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,500
You know Max.

535
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,300
He was just
joking around.

536
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,100
You think Max took it ?

537
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,800
If you didn't...

538
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,400
What's it matter ?

539
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,400
Sarge is right...
I'll never be a good Marine.

540
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,800
You've got more guts
than half of these guys.

541
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,100
I don't care
what Sarge says.

542
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,400
How you figure that ?

543
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,800
You lied about your age
to get into the Corps.

544
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,400
I know a lot of
guys who lied

545
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,200
so they wouldn't have to serve.

546
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,700
Why are you so nice
to me, Tully ?

547
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,100
Remind me of
my kid brother, I guess.

548
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,800
Memphis ?

549
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,600
Only place I could think of.

550
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,400
If you run now,

551
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,600
you'll never
stop running.

552
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,300
- I don't know, Tully.
- I'm gonna find Max,

553
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,700
I'm gonna make this right.

554
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,200
So you can either
get on that bus,

555
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,700
or you can go back to the ship,

556
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,700
you can look Sergeant
Chaney in the eyes,

557
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,300
and you can
tell him the truth.

558
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,800
The choice is yours.

559
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,800
Hardest thing
I ever did,

560
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,600
not getting on
that bus.

561
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,500
Shore patrol
was waiting,

562
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,300
threw me right
in the brig.

563
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,900
Look, when'd you hear
Tully went AWOL ?

564
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,500
Halfway to Korea--
one of the guards told me.

565
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,600
It didn't make
a lot of sense, though.

566
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,700
You know if Tully found Max
that night ?

567
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,900
I don't know.

568
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,300
But if Tully gave you
his word on something,

569
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,000
pretty much meant
it was gonna happen.

570
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,700
He wasn't just
an outstanding Marine,

571
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,200
he was like a brother to me.

572
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,700
Semper Fi.

573
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,600
Spic and Span time, Max--

574
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,600
you lied to us about
seeing Tully.

575
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,800
- I said I didn't remember.
- That amnesia

576
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,800
extend to taking that
officer's gun ?

577
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,600
You were going to let Snow
swing for that,

578
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,300
only Tully wasn't going
to let that happen.

579
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,800
He was going to
turn you in,

580
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,900
so you shot him before
he had the chance.

581
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,400
You got it all wrong.

582
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,000
You took that
officer's gun,

583
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,400
and that's conduct
unbecoming the Corps.

584
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,800
So is shooting a guy who was
just trying to help a friend.

585
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,100
I'm guilty of a
lot of things--

586
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,500
being a bad Marine
is just one of 'em.

587
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,300
But you can't say the
same about Tully.

588
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,800
He was some
top-shelf stuff.

589
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,500
<i>"Rocket 88"
by Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats.</i>

590
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,800
Hey, it's Punchy !

591
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,500
Give me the weapon, Max.

592
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,200
Don't know what you're
talking about.

593
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,600
Cut the crap.
Snow told me.

594
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,800
Ah. You gonna
rat me out?

595
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,900
Of course not.

596
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,300
But I need it back.

597
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,800
It was a  joke...

598
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,500
to mess with
Lieutenant JG Putnam,

599
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,100
make him think he lost
his precious revolver.

600
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,200
A joke ?

601
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,700
You know, Snow's thinkin'
about going AWOL

602
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,300
because he can't face
Sergeant Chaney ?

603
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,700
That sound funny to you ?

604
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,700
Best thing for our platoon would
be for that guy to wash out.

605
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,600
You're wrong about him.

606
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,700
That guy's a walking
mortar magnet.

607
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,200
Don't waste your last hours
of shore leave on Snow.

608
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,600
Just give me the weapon, Max.

609
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,900
I can't. I pawned it.

610
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,600
How do you think
I met these friendly ladies ?

611
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,800
60 bucks ?!

612
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,300
How am I supposed
to get that kind of money ?

613
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,400
- How much you got ?
- Ten.

614
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,700
I was gonna use it to buy
something special for Nora.

615
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,500
Don't worry.

616
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,400
I'll chip in.

617
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,000
I'm not proud of what I did,

618
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,200
but I never saw Tully
with that pistol.

619
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,400
So he doesn't show for
the boat ride to Korea

620
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,700
and you don't say a word ?

621
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,700
I thought maybe he took off
with that girl

622
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,200
he was so hot
to get back to.

623
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,600
It's what I'd have done.

624
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,800
Back when I could run.

625
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,400
We've got a gun,

626
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,600
but no one
who saw Tully with it.

627
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,700
So Tully leaves Max and what,
gets the gun out of hock ?

628
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,300
But he'd need money
for that.

629
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,100
I think I know
where he got it.

630
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,000
Tully did find Nora
later that night.

631
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:30,900
How do you figure ?

632
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,400
Well, something wasn't
sitting right,

633
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,300
so I checked into Ben Conlin,
Nora's late husband.

634
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,600
- The Navy officer.
- Yeah.

635
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,500
Thought if I
could put him

636
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,300
and Tully in town at
the same time...

637
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,300
But he was stationed
in Japan.

638
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,500
Yeah, a dead end.

639
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,000
Till I found this.

640
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,400
Ben Conlin adopted

641
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,700
Nora Lee's three-
month-old baby boy.

642
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,400
A month after
they got married.

643
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,100
Birth certificate lists
the father as "unknown."

644
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,400
Math points to Tully,

645
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,900
and their romance didn't end
in that photo booth.

646
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,800
In 1952, tough time to be
a single mother.

647
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,700
- You must have...
- I don't know what you're talking about.

648
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,600
Come, Nora. You didn't meet Ben
til Peter was born.

649
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,800
Peter

650
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,600
is Tully's son.

651
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,500
Got the records
to prove it.

652
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,400
I've never told anyone.

653
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,200
Not even Peter.

654
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,300
You lied about
seeing Tully again.

655
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,800
Makes it hard for me to believe
anything you say now.

656
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,200
What choice did I have ?

657
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,500
So I'd Start thinking--
maybe Tully does go AWOL,

658
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,700
then he finds out
you're pregnant,

659
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,600
and wants to leave you.

660
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,200
No. You can check.

661
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,500
I wrote letters,

662
00:31:45,501 --> 00:31:47,701
filed paternity
requests with the VA.

663
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,500
I didn't know where
Jimmy was, either.

664
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,100
Then tell me what happened.

665
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,100
I waited all night
for him to come back,

666
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,600
staring out my window,
praying to God.

667
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,200
And then, there he was.

668
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,400
Nora.

669
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,700
Oh, I never thought
I'd see you again.

670
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,200
What's bothering you,
Jimmy ?

671
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,300
Nothing.
It's just...

672
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,800
I'm here.

673
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,800
What happened
with shore patrol ?

674
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,300
Spill.

675
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,400
I just want to make the most
of our last hours together.

676
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,900
Just let me look at you.

677
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,800
You gotta be straight
with me.

678
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,500
Something's eating
at you.

679
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,700
They're looking for
a friend of mine.

680
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,800
A friend who didn't do what
they're saying he did.

681
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,600
And, uh...

682
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,900
I tried to help him.

683
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,700
I couldn't.

684
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,200
Why couldn't you ?

685
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,800
Because I don't have the money
to prove he's innocent.

686
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,700
And if you had
the money,

687
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,600
you could use it
to help your friend ?

688
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,600
Look, if I help him...

689
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,700
and he dies over there...

690
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,500
You don't know
the future.

691
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,400
You can only follow your gut,

692
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,200
like you did following me
into that bar

693
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,200
and... pestering me
for a dance.

694
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,600
I can be pretty persistent
when I need to be.

695
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,900
What is this ?

696
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,700
My mother wore it
on her wedding day.

697
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,000
It's got
to be worth more

698
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,400
than whatever's
behind that pawn ticket.

699
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,600
- Nora, I can't...
- I don't want to hear another word.

700
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,400
Look, it's not worth a lot,

701
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,900
but it's been in my family
for a long time.

702
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,400
Will you keep this for me ?

703
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,600
Yes.

704
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,400
I'll be waiting for you at
the docks, before we push off.

705
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,300
Wait, wait...

706
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:15,100
I waited by the docks to see
him one last time, but...

707
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,500
Tully didn't leave you...

708
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,200
he was taken from you.

709
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,200
He was a special man.

710
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,900
One look and I knew
what he was made of.

711
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,200
I want his family
to have this.

712
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,600
This will mean a lot
to his kid brother Steve.

713
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,200
Detective Rush...

714
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,500
Jimmy was the
love of my life.

715
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,200
Thank you for giving
that back to me.

716
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,700
So, Tully uses Nora's necklace
to get the gun out of hock.

717
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,900
Tully was a
hard charger.

718
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,500
Goes back to the ship,

719
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,800
puts the weapon back in
Putnam's locker or returns it

720
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,300
to his platoon sergeant.

721
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,800
Tough play, either way.

722
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,500
He digs, he scores.

723
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,700
You were right, boss.

724
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,000
Military doesn't buy
a tin of beans or toss a grenade

725
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,300
unless there's a paper trail.

726
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,800
De-requisition order
to dispose

727
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,100
of six steel oil drums
of hazardous material

728
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,700
from the USS Pronto.

729
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,100
September 9.

730
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,400
Date matches up.

731
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,400
Stuff like that doesn't
get on or off a ship

732
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,200
without the engine
room knowing about it.

733
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,300
"Mean Gene" Karnow
was a machinist mate.

734
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,600
Throw this wrench at him,
see how he answers.

735
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,200
This supposed to mean
something ?

736
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,800
The date's of interest,

737
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,800
especially seeing as how Tully's body
was found in an oil drum.

738
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,500
Right, the Marine.

739
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,700
You remember this order ?

740
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,400
Yeah, I come back
from, uh, shore leave,

741
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,700
and there's, uh, a Marine
sergeant screaming at me

742
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,100
to get rid of the
waste oil drums ASAP.

743
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,900
I tell him I don't take orders
from a jarhead.

744
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,800
Navy ship, Navy engine room.

745
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,700
You refused to
dump those drums ?

746
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Yeah, and in
about ten minutes,

747
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,700
my chief comes down
and chews me out,

748
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,600
so I go ahead
and get rid of 'em.

749
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,700
This Marine sergeant--

750
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,200
his name by any chance Chaney ?

751
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,700
Yeah, that's him.

752
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,500
Thought he was all hard,

753
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,200
but then we get out
to rough seas,

754
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,800
he's out back puking
his guts out over the rail.

755
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,100
Chaney.

756
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,600
Took a look at your medical

757
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:29,101
and service record books,
Sergeant Chaney.

758
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,200
Spent most of your second tour
in the field hospital.

759
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,100
Significant battle fatigue ?

760
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,700
You ask me down here to
question my service record ?

761
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,800
You're way out of your depth, son.

762
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,400
Something must have been
eating at you real bad,

763
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,100
'cause you never saw any action
during your second tour.

764
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,500
You want to ask me something
about Tully, ask it,

765
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,200
but I will not sit here

766
00:36:49,201 --> 00:36:52,001
and have you question
my service to this country.

767
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,100
This interview is over.

768
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,700
You want, we can cuff
you to that chair.

769
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,400
I had an officer like you--
a ball-busting son of a bitch.

770
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,800
I hated that bastard...

771
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,500
but when it was said and done,

772
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,700
he just wanted
what was best for his men.

773
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,700
He had a code.

774
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,000
Best ones do.

775
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,300
Is that why you were trying
to wash out PFC Snow ?

776
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,700
What the hell does this
have to do with Snow ?

777
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,600
Answer the question !

778
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,500
Snow didn't belong
in the Marines !

779
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,500
And it was your job
to sort men like him.

780
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,500
Snow was going to fill up his boots
the very minute he saw those Chinamen

781
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,100
coming at us in waves.

782
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,800
With all due respect, sir,

783
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,800
you were wrong about Snow,
dead wrong.

784
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,300
He was 15 years old.

785
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,500
He wanted to be a Marine so bad
he lied about his age.

786
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,000
You buried him behind a desk
and he still made it to the front line.

787
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,200
Awarded the Bronze Star
and Navy Cross.

788
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,100
That's a lot of bull.
Snow did no such thing.

789
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:56,300
Account of Private First Class
Lenny Snow's heroic actions during battle.

790
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,500
While you were cooling
your heels in a field hospital,

791
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,000
this is what
a brave Marine was doing.

792
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,800
"During a sudden enemy ambush,

793
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,400
"Private First Class Snow
unhesitatingly

794
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,900
"left his foxhole,

795
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,700
"moved through withering fire,
and employing his rifle,

796
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,300
"inflicted numerous casualties.

797
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,700
"His actions saved the lives
of his fellow Marines."

798
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,700
I will not listen to this.

799
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,700
Snow was going
to get us all killed over there.

800
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,900
I should know.

801
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,100
I've seen it before.

802
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,000
Lenny Snow exemplified
the Marine Corps.

803
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,200
Negative !

804
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,600
Then just when you think
you got Snow going AWOL,

805
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,300
Tully shows up to plead his case,

806
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,200
says he knows
Lenny didn't take that gun.

807
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,700
- Tully was wrong.
- Not about Snow he wasn't, and you know it.

808
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,400
You're still a Marine.

809
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,700
Act like one.

810
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,500
Son of a bitch
wouldn't back down.

811
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,100
He threatened
to pull rank on me.

812
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,800
On me!

813
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,000
This better be good, Tully.

814
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,000
Getting me out of the rack

815
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,800
- at this time of night.
- Sir...

816
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,600
PFC Snow did not take Lieutenant
JG Putnam's revolver, sir.

817
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,800
Where did you get this, Tully ?

818
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,500
- I cannot say, sir.
- I didn't copy that.

819
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,500
You will give me that weapon.
That is an order.

820
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,700
Sir, I wish only to clear
Private Snow's name.

821
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,800
PFC Snow is not worthy
of being a Marine.

822
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,900
- Snow is a coward and a thief,
- Sir...

823
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,300
and will not tarnish the
Marine Corps with his presence.

824
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,800
...with all due respect
to Sergeant Chaney,

825
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,900
PFC Snow is neither
a coward nor a thief.

826
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,300
You have no idea what
it takes to be a Marine.

827
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,200
PFC Snow believes you are
trying to wash him out, sir,

828
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,600
something that is against
Marine Corps tradition.

829
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,000
Do not lecture me
about tradition !

830
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,700
Now, you will stand down
and give me that weapon.

831
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,600
I can't do that, sir.

832
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,500
You are disobeying orders,
PFC Tully !

833
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:52,500
You will give me that weapon
and you will tell me where PFC Snow is,

834
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,900
or I will see to it that
your sorry butt is booted back

835
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,600
to whatever ungrateful hole
you crawled out of.

836
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,500
Sergeant, I am prepared
to go to Captain Ryan  and tell him the truth.

837
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,500
The truth ?

838
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,300
And what truth is that ?

839
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,800
That you wish to pin the theft
of an officer's weapon

840
00:40:07,801 --> 00:40:09,201
on an innocent man.

841
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,800
You will do no such thing.

842
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,600
'Cause I decide which Marines remain
in this platoon.

843
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,400
Me and only me.

844
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,100
Sir, I can't
let you do that.

845
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,000
You...!

846
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,700
Sergeant, please.
