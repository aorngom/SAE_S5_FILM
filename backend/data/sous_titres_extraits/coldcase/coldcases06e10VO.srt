BOONE STANDS ALONE

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,570
August 14, 2005

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,500
<i>"Gone"
by Kanye West.</i>

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,010
Where the hell have you been ?

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,360
You are 20 minutes late,

7
00:00:23,361 --> 00:00:25,361
and this is our first actual press
for this campaign.

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,720
I'll make it up to him.

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,720
It's going to take a little more
than just a charming smile, Dex.

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,680
And what do you have
on your feet ?!

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,670
You told me to buy the suit.

12
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,840
You didn't say anything
about the shoes.

13
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,830
Sorry to hold you up.

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,210
I was at the community center.

15
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,490
Running that center,
must certainly get culture shock

16
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:43,591
compared to corporate
litigation, eh ?

17
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,670
No comparison.

18
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,140
What I do now matters.

19
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,070
So, uh, what made you decide

20
00:00:48,071 --> 00:00:50,271
to jump into the tar pit
of municipal politics ?

21
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,440
<i>Look sharp !</i>

22
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,780
Gonna have to get you boys a
real hoop one of these days.

23
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,010
Sorry about that Dex is really
dedicated to the kids down here.

24
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,390
He's going to need
more dedication

25
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:04,991
to knock Grover Boone
off his perch.

26
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,530
Your guy has got no name,
no connections, and no money.

27
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,430
Well, he's got something better.

28
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,210
Hey, Eric...

29
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,610
Heart.

30
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,980
They move your brother
out of the ICU yet ?

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,630
I'm keeping him in my prayers.

32
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,980
You need anything,you
come see me, you hear ?

33
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,750
This boy Eric's older brother was walking
home the other night,

34
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:27,851
caught a stray bullet.

35
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,230
Local dealers flexing
muscle at each other.

36
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,790
Happens every day out here.

37
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,300
It doesn't make it right,
though, does it ?

38
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,220
So to answer your question :

39
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,921
That's why I'm running
for city council.

40
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,090
Sixth Street is the biggest
drug market in North Philly.

41
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,000
Cops can't stop it.
Boone can't stop it.

42
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,610
What are you going to do about it?

43
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,800
I'm going to shut the whole thing down.

44
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,030
<i>In other news,
police sources said today </i>

45
00:02:07,031 --> 00:02:08,831
<i>that murdered city council
hopeful,</i>

46
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:12,940
<i>Dexter Collins,was in possession of
a significant amount of crack cocaine,</i>

47
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,760
<i>strengthening speculation that the anti-drug
candidate struggled with an addiction</i>

48
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,740
<i>that led to his death just
five days before the election.</i>

49
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,150
Bleeding ulcers, man.

50
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,200
I haven't eaten in days.

51
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,020
The prison doctors are useless.
I can't take it anymore.

52
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,020
That's something you should've considered
before robbing five liquor stores.

53
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,090
Show some holiday spirit,man.
I'm looking at 15 years.

54
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,380
We're looking at a three-hour
drive back to Philly.

55
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,940
Lawyer said you got something
to give ?

56
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,600
You know that after-hours
joint on Susky ?

57
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,340
"The Red Rooster" ?

58
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,570
Got it on good authority a lot
of those waitresses are pros.

59
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,300
What ? You're leaving ?

60
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,530
We're Homicide, Luther.
We deal in bodies, not hookers.

61
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,160
You're as dumb as you look

62
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:01,661
if you think that weak crap
is gonna to fly.

63
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,170
I was just warming up.

64
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,850
I'll see you in 15.

65
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,410
Dexter Collins ?

66
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,320
- What about him ?
- He didn't get killed by no drugs.

67
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,650
He was assassinated.

68
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:15,151
"Sixth Street Mafia".

69
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,400
And you witnessed this ?

70
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,810
A crackhead up at Graterford
told me on the cell block,

71
00:03:18,811 --> 00:03:20,211
when I serving my last bit.

72
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,320
He saw the whole thing go down.

73
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,590
Let's talk to the smokehound.

74
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,030
Dead. TB. Last year.

75
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,990
Happen to ID the doer
before he died ?

76
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,220
He said he didn't get
a good look.

77
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,140
Aw, that's great. Second-hand
BS from a dead witness.

78
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,290
Any more garbage
you wanna peddle ? Hey...

79
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,090
The gun they used...
.40 caliber SIG ?

80
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,350
Y'all ever find it ?

81
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,780
What's your point ?

82
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,190
I know where it is.

83
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,080
There's nothing here.

84
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,410
Wait a minute.

85
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,300
40 caliber SIG Sauer.

86
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,330
Guess Luther's not as dumb as he looks.

87
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,890
Cold Case
Season 6

88
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,940
Transcript VO : www.ydy.com

89
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,700
Street money

90
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,270
Dexter Collins,
found shot to death

91
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:51,371
on Sixth Street,
2:00 in the morning.

92
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,560
Looked like a drug deal
gone bad.

93
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,760
He was 30 years old,
raised in the badlands,

94
00:04:55,761 --> 00:04:58,161
full ride at Penn, Yale Law,
then Wall Street.

95
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,020
The guy was a lightweight.

96
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,640
He gave it up to be
a community activist.

97
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:01,941
Ran for city council.

98
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,700
Said he was gonna take
on the drug dealers.

99
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,220
Anti-drug candidate
found shot to death

100
00:05:07,221 --> 00:05:09,121
with a crack pipe
and a fistful of vials.

101
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,370
The crack thing never jibed to me.

102
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,380
He was a reformer.
Refused to take "street money".

103
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,830
Said he was going to earn votes,
not buy them.

104
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,680
Ward bosses must've loved that.

105
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,150
Newspapers went to town
after his death.

106
00:05:20,151 --> 00:05:21,751
Called him the
"Crackhead Candidate".

107
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,090
But they never reported this :

108
00:05:23,091 --> 00:05:25,891
"The autopsy didn't find
any drugs in Dex's system."

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,720
Maybe he hadn't used in a while?

110
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,160
Or maybe the drugs were planted.

111
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,550
- Frame job ?
- This was a nasty campaign.

112
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,750
Dex was giving Grover
Boone a run for his money.

113
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,560
30 years on the city council ?

114
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,960
Boone would eat his own
children to hold on to his seat.

115
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:41,460
Commissioner created a task
force to solve Dex's murder.

116
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,540
Two dozen cops, handpicked,

117
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,341
hardly any homicide experience.

118
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,800
Guess how that went.

119
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,340
So, let's look into Luther's story.

120
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,670
The gun we found is a
match as the murder weapon,

121
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,030
but there's nothing connecting
it to the "Sixth Street Mafia".

122
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,540
We need more on Dex Collins
than news reports and rumors.

123
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:56,541
Who was close to him ?

124
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,450
Well, the father, Ronnie Collins,
raised Dex by himself.

125
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,020
And also his campaign manager,
Cassie Michaels.

126
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,180
Re-interview them,

127
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,881
but let's not rattle too many cages
until we know what we're going at.

128
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,300
I'm going to meet
the campaign manager.

129
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,480
Something I got to take care of.

130
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,290
"Cooper".

131
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,570
Who's that ?

132
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,080
I keep getting my neighbor's mail.

133
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,300
You might want to stop
by the post office.

134
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,220
Check it out...
nine o'clock.

135
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,780
Oh, not bad.

136
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,440
You think I got a chance
at something like that ?

137
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,230
Absolutely.

138
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,550
- Yeah ?
- Yeah.

139
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,840
- Hey, you.
- How's it going, Frankie ?

140
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,560
Oh, you know,
busy working on my swing.

141
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,520
- Yep.
- Listen, I got to jet.

142
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,770
See you later ?

143
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,560
See ya.

144
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,010
You're an ass.

145
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,010
Dex was special.

146
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,430
We met in law school,

147
00:07:23,431 --> 00:07:24,931
and I could tell
he was going places,

148
00:07:24,932 --> 00:07:27,532
so I jumped at the chance
to work on his campaign.

149
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,770
That must've been a shock,
the way he died...

150
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:31,371
murdered in the street like that.

151
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,110
Couple questions
that never got resolved...

152
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:35,211
Dex's involvement
with drugs for one.

153
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,700
Dex never so much as took a
drink as long as I knew him.

154
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,690
I was his campaign manager.

155
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,740
My job was knowing about his
skeletons,and he didn't have any.

156
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,330
Sounds too good to be true.

157
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,350
- Well, it's too good for this city.
- Meaning ?

158
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,030
Philly's political machine
has been in place forever.

159
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,840
If you want to run for office,
then you need name recognition.

160
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,770
So you pay the ward leaders,
in cash,

161
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:56,271
to go spread the good word.

162
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,300
Street money.

163
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,990
Ostensibly it goes to expenses,
but...

164
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,490
mostly it just goes into their pockets.

165
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,180
Dex refused to do that,
so he made some enemies.

166
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,970
Any of these enemies the type
who'd shoot Dex,

167
00:08:05,971 --> 00:08:07,271
plant drugs on him ?

168
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,500
In my business, we specialize
in character assassination.

169
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:12,301
Not the other kind.

170
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:15,380
So explain what Dex was
doing on a known drug corner,

171
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,650
dead of night,
if it wasn't for drugs.

172
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,710
He was on a mission.

173
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,710
Let's get real.

174
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,170
The drug war is over ;
we lost.

175
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:32,750
There's a boy, 16 years old, who was shot
by drug dealers,

176
00:08:32,851 --> 00:08:35,251
died in ICU last night.

177
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:39,430
His 12-year-old brother
cried in my arms,asked me why.

178
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,660
I couldn't tell him that's
just how it is on Sixth Street.

179
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,660
I couldn't say, our district leader,
Grover Boone,

180
00:08:46,661 --> 00:08:48,861
is too busy hosting
parties for real

181
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,690
estate developers to be accountable
for the blood on our street.

182
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,530
I need to answer that boy's question.

183
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,350
Give me a chance.

184
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,840
Sign my petion to
be added to the ballot,

185
00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:10,641
and I swear to you, I will always
be here and accountable.

186
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,720
Your name's Warren, right ?

187
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,200
Own the Diamond Diner.
What's wrong ?

188
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:23,590
I don't need an outsider telling
me what it's like on my own street.

189
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,470
I'm not an outsider.

190
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,330
I grew up here.

191
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,420
Live here now,
just down the block.

192
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,500
Well... you sure as hell didn't
get that suit on Sixth Street.

193
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,750
Come on.Come on.

194
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,130
I, uh... I assure you I, uh,

195
00:09:54,631 --> 00:09:58,631
plan to take better care of our district
than my apartment.

196
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,050
What's this about ?

197
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,010
Uh... my dad.

198
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,090
Some of you may know him.

199
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,310
Ronnie Collins.

200
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,560
Every morning he's woken up,

201
00:10:12,561 --> 00:10:15,161
knowing he'd have
to push a mop all day.

202
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:20,590
But he's had faith each day his
hard work was going to pay off.

203
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,110
That faith gave me a better life.

204
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,780
So every morning, I wake up,

205
00:10:26,981 --> 00:10:30,081
I look in the mirror,
and I see faith.

206
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,550
I know I can do the same for you.

207
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,230
All I need is your signature.

208
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:43,231
<i>"Guns are drawn"
by The Roots.</i>

209
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,600
Do you remember those signs painted
on sidewalks and bus shelters?

210
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,640
Yeah, "Faith."
They were everywhere.

211
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,220
It wasn't even us who did that.

212
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,930
Dex's supporters did it themselves.

213
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:00,990
End of the day,

214
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,591
it wasn't power or
politics for Dex.

215
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,470
All he cared about was that damn street.

216
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,540
And he paid for it with his life.

217
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,960
Got a hit
on the murder weapon, boss.

218
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:16,790
Registered in '04 to a Jay Quincy,
a truck driver in Chester.

219
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,760
Reported the gun stolen
with a couple others

220
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,461
a few weeks before Dex's death.

221
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:21,860
He's done it before, too.

222
00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:23,361
Once in Jersey, twice in Delaware.

223
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,550
- A straw purchaser.
- Lowest of the low.

224
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,610
Reports guns stolen and
sells them on the street.

225
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,270
Figure he sold to Dex's killer.

226
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,330
Maybe one of the
"Sixth Street Mafia".

227
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,740
Last cops I talked to were a joke.

228
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,420
They already made up
their minds about him.

229
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:38,221
They didn't even know
what he was about.

230
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,120
You and your son
pretty tight, Mr.Collins ?

231
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,340
Put everything into Dex.

232
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,740
You understand, I...

233
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,720
I wanted him to have opportunity,
get him away from here.

234
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,460
But he came home.

235
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,120
Said he wanted to change the
way things worked on the streets.

236
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,610
Who was I to tell him the
street wasn't worth the trouble ?

237
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,520
He was going after the dealers.

238
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,510
Only one who had guts
enough to stand up to them.

239
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,260
What was his reward ?

240
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,420
Called him the crackhead candidate.

241
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,920
Guess that sells more papers than...

242
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,580
faith.

243
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:18,130
Taking a look at the
"Sixth Street Mafia".

244
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,160
- It's about time.
- Why is that ?

245
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,610
Dex was out there every night
trying to save folks,

246
00:12:23,611 --> 00:12:26,411
and those gangsters
didn't like it one damn bit.

247
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,630
£¨" the corner  "by common £©

248
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,910
Hey, friend, can I talk to you ?

249
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,320
Listen, man, you don't have
to be doing this.

250
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,530
Saying you're not alone.

251
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,900
Take my card, come see me.

252
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,480
We can help you get clean,
give you options.

253
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,040
You best start moving.

254
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,080
I ain't even playing.

255
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,130
I know you. Victor Nash.

256
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,470
- We grew up together.
- Yeah, so ?

257
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,120
My dad helped us set up
that car wash, remember ?

258
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,360
Two bucks a car.

259
00:13:07,361 --> 00:13:09,161
Thought we were
some regular Trumps.

260
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,690
Look, 'cause we know each other,
I'm gonna give you a pass.

261
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,170
Go home. Now.

262
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,960
I won't go until all of you go first.

263
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,580
How you plan on pulling that off ?
You strapped ?

264
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,450
I don't got a gun.

265
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,110
I got faith.

266
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,760
But see, I got a gun.

267
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,610
Yeah ?

268
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,600
But you won't use it.

269
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,150
Victor Nash was...

270
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,580
a screwup from the age of ten.

271
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,210
Dex saw something there worth saving.

272
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,290
For a while,
it looked like he was right.

273
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,670
Victor left the corner ?

274
00:13:54,671 --> 00:13:57,071
Did odd jobs
at the campaign office.

275
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,980
Yeah, but I never trusted him myself.

276
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,460
You don't just walk away
from a gang like Sixth Street.

277
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,270
After Dex died, Victor
went right back to them.

278
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,010
No questions asked.

279
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,390
Yeah, Scotty.

280
00:14:30,491 --> 00:14:31,791
Traffic, huh ?

281
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,810
I'll meet you on Sixth Street.

282
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,400
This a private game ?

283
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,540
Relax, folks.
Just looking for someone.

284
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,910
Hey, Victor.

285
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,650
I didn't do nothing.

286
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,970
Besides slinging rock, guns,
agg assault ?

287
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:00,171
That's all in the past ?

288
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,970
One of those early achievers,
I guess.

289
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,500
Hey, why y'all hassling me ?

290
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,610
- Dex Collins.
- I can't help you.

291
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,680
Now, see,
that's not how this works.

292
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,070
We ask questions, then you lie.

293
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,610
Whoops,a gun.

294
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,540
This the one you pulled on Dex ?

295
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,610
That was a misunderstanding.

296
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,950
Like hanging around his campaign
just before you popped him ?

297
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,610
Where were you, huh,
the night he got shot ?

298
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:20,790
I was at an NA meeting.

299
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,030
I was all messed up ;
I was getting high,

300
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:25,631
half hoping to get busted or dead.

301
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,510
He helped me.

302
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,300
Come on, Victor. Still a soldier.

303
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,080
Sixth Street was losing business
with his nightly visits to the corner.

304
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,540
Dex reached out to you,
and you put one in his chest.

305
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,140
Sixth Street was nothing compared
to who was really after Dex.

306
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:46,141
<i>"5 O'clock" by Perceptionists
& Phonet of Little Brother.</i>

307
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,110
- Is all this really necessary ?
- Yes.

308
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:55,810
Dex, I have every member of
the district coming here today.

309
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,600
I have ward leaders and clergy,

310
00:15:57,601 --> 00:16:00,201
most of them expecting
more than just a free meal.

311
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,780
I'm not paying for votes.

312
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,000
Then, you need to convince
them to support you.

313
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,630
Dex, champagne's gonna help
with that.

314
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,970
I should be out on the corner,
not kissing political ass.

315
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,010
You need to do both.

316
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:14,150
Dex,look, I think that you
actually have a shot here,

317
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,590
okay, so just straighten
this tie and put on a smile.

318
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,560
It's only gonna hurt a little.

319
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,290
What's going on ?

320
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,150
Warren Wilson...

321
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,420
I'm Lieutenant Doherty.

322
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,530
This is notification that you're shut
down

323
00:16:36,531 --> 00:16:37,831
for health violations
pending review.

324
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,570
The inspector was here two months ago.
There weren't any problems.

325
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,810
You'll have to take that up
with the Health Department...

326
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,830
assuming you have a liquor license.

327
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:48,360
We're hosting a private party
here tonight, expecting 150 guests.

328
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,690
Not anymore... building's
only zoned for 70.

329
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,700
Oh, are you the fire marshal, too,
or just Boone's hatchet man ?

330
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,550
Cassie, it's okay.

331
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,520
He's only doing what he's told.

332
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,470
Isn't that right, Lieutenant ?

333
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,400
<i>Send the rich boy home.</i>

334
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,950
<i>Vote Grover Boone.</i>

335
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,610
<i>He stands alone.</i>

336
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,130
<i>Send the rich boy home.</i>

337
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,820
<i>Vote Grover Boone.</i>

338
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,810
<i>He stands alone.</i>

339
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,290
Boone is like any other
gangster in the street.

340
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,060
He's got muscle, too...
only they wear badges.

341
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,340
Now I know
you're still using, Victor.

342
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,290
Saying a cop did Dex Collins, huh ?

343
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,720
Saying if Boone wanted
Dex done, he'd be done.

344
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,500
- You fill in the blanks.
- Yeah, we'll do that.

345
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,410
You remember how
the rest of this goes.

346
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,310
Came up in the department
with Pat Doherty.

347
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,220
He's never served a day of street duty.

348
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,390
- Desk jockey, huh ?
- Political operator.

349
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,960
Goes lieutenant to deputy
commissioner in two years.

350
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,420
- Hitched his wagon to Boone.
- Not just him.

351
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,910
Health Department closes
Warren's restaurant in '05.

352
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,170
He files a complaint
that gets thrown out.

353
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,660
Electricity's shut down
in his house the next day.

354
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,480
Yeah, Boone takes no prisoners.

355
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,950
He's not all bad.
Hires cops to moonlight for him.

356
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,470
Speaks up for us at city hall.

357
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,360
And then condemns us on the
5:00 news when it hits the fan.

358
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,690
This election got ugly.

359
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,720
Dex's campaign office
was broken into,

360
00:17:58,721 --> 00:18:00,321
volunteers harassed.

361
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,860
Maybe someone went too far.

362
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,190
Making extra points for
taking out the competion.

363
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,580
Meeting with Warren,

364
00:18:05,581 --> 00:18:08,181
see if he remembers
any rabid Boone supporters.

365
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,320
Gonna contact Boone, too.

366
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,440
That's a hornet's nest, Scotty.

367
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,510
I'll handle Boone.

368
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:18,720
You sold the guns on the street,
filed a false report.

369
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,520
Not the first time, either.
You got a whole side business going.

370
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,810
- Ain't that right?
- I don't recall.

371
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,750
Listen, Ray.

372
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,680
It's Jay.

373
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,990
Right... Jay.

374
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,010
I pulled the other reports you filed.

375
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,050
I got them right here.

376
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,750
Uh... somewhere.

377
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,530
Hang on a second.

378
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:45,020
Seven handguns in Delaware in 2002.

379
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,060
12 in Jersey the next year.

380
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,600
I got bad luck.

381
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,180
Don't know the half of it.

382
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,790
One of your guns was used in
the shooting of a policeman.

383
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,180
Another wounded a little
girl on a playground.

384
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,750
Now, I'm a cop and a mom, Jay.

385
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,030
You've pissed me off twice already.

386
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,300
Then, there's Dex Collins.
Sold the gun to the killer.

387
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,270
That's conspiracy.

388
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,920
- Prove it.
- That's why the DA's here, Jay.

389
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:11,340
To be honest,
I'm not that good a lawyer.

390
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,980
ADD, you know ? Makes it hard.

391
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:18,040
That's why I work this crap job.
Oh, here we go, okay, so...

392
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
the report says that

393
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:22,401
the guns were stolen
from your mother's house,

394
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,030
so even when we prove
this false

395
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,590
and we will-- any half-assed
public defender's gonna say that

396
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,020
we can't connect it to you,
so what I'm proposing is...

397
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,460
So I can go.

398
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,930
Yeah...

399
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,170
but Mom's gonna have to stay.

400
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,190
Like you're gonna arrest an old lady.

401
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:42,100
You see, Ray, not only are
we arresting her, but, uh...

402
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,500
we're gonna convict her,too.

403
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,520
Hey, Mrs.Quincy.

404
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,730
Your old lady's gonna spend
the rest of her life

405
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,031
in a cage thinking one thing :

406
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,960
"My son did this to me."

407
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,230
It was a Dominican guy.

408
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,600
Hangs out at the Hardware Depot.

409
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,150
Jorge Gonzalez.
Okay ?Anything else ?

410
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,230
Yeah, you gonna drink that ?

411
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,500
You should have called first,John.

412
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,520
Yeah, would he have called back ?

413
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,220
This is about Dex Collins.

414
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,110
I'm looking for a list of
supporters from the last campaign.

415
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:39,000
- Never gonna happen.
- You impeding an investigation ?

416
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,010
I'm looking out for you, John.

417
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:45,530
Look, Boone is just gonna
refer you to his attorney.

418
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,980
Then, he's gonna call
the commissioner

419
00:20:46,981 --> 00:20:48,881
and have you transferred
to the motor pool.

420
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,840
We did a thorough job on
this case three years ago.

421
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,040
Dex Collins was killed buying dope.

422
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,610
Except you didn't find the doer.

423
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,390
He was probably dead, too...
community service murder.

424
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,980
You don't want to start a riot in
the streets by stirring this up.

425
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,190
You worried about a riot in the
streets or a riot in city hall ?

426
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,580
Both.

427
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,370
So, Boone is refusing
to cooperate ?

428
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,060
Did I say that ?

429
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,590
Come on,John,relax,we're
working the same job here.

430
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,030
I do police work, Pat.
Not exactly sure what you do.

431
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,880
Councilman Boone.

432
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,830
Good to see you, Lieutenant.
Sorry I can't talk.

433
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,490
Do it again real soon.

434
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:41,170
You paid a big price supporting Dexter Collins
during the election, going against the Boone machine.

435
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,430
Yeah, it was tough for a while.

436
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,510
No income, three daughters.

437
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,680
Worked 12 hours a day for Dex,

438
00:21:48,081 --> 00:21:50,781
then bartended at a club
after hours just to get by.

439
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,850
Back in business now, though.

440
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,880
Boone cooled off after Dex died.

441
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,140
Think it was one of Boone's people ?
Got overenthusiastic, went after Dex ?

442
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,200
Well, everybody was kind of crazy.

443
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:04,430
You know, bricks were thrown,
tires slashed,

444
00:22:04,931 --> 00:22:07,631
but the worst damage
we did to ourselves.

445
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:08,720
What does that mean ?

446
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,500
Well,we were doing well in
the polls, but, uh,

447
00:22:11,601 --> 00:22:12,901
flat broke.

448
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,320
The big donors were afraid
of alienating Boone,

449
00:22:15,321 --> 00:22:17,521
so we got into bed
with the wrong people.

450
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:21,240
You're saying it was one of Dex's
own supporters who took him out ?

451
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:25,890
I'm saying,
you lie down with dogs...

452
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,710
He's here. Mulwrey is here.

453
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,560
He's,like,five steps behind me.

454
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,000
- I thought you were pitching him.
- Yeah,but he said that he wanted to meet you.

455
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,850
Dex,this guy is big
money,and he is no bull,okay?

456
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:41,070
We are one minute away
from having our phones repossessed,

457
00:22:41,071 --> 00:22:42,471
so, please don't piss him off.

458
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:46,240
Okay,don't preach to him.
Just be normal, okay ?

459
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,320
- We need this.
- Mr. Mulwrey, um...

460
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,940
Why don't you,uh,come into my office?

461
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,040
- Mr. Mulwrey?
- I've heard enough. You're my guy.

462
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,460
Just maybe consider
some real shoes.

463
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,890
Oh, my God !

464
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:28,390
There was 50 grand easy
in that case.

465
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,840
- Street money.
- What did Mulwrey want in return ?

466
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:34,920
He was lobbying city hall to redevelop
the Chandler Housing Projects.

467
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:37,490
Would have displaced
hundreds of poor residents.

468
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,550
Dex spoke out against
that during the campaign.

469
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,750
Mulwrey figured he'd buy Dex's silence.

470
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,490
But the next day,Dex held a press conference
denouncing the Chandler redevelopment.

471
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:50,780
So Dex takes the man's money
and screws him a day later.

472
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,980
Mulwrey comes out of the
construction business.

473
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,470
Waste management.
Plays by different rules.

474
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,470
You hit him, he hits back.

475
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,440
With a vengeance.

476
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,900
This used to be the Chandler
Housing Project, right ?

477
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,670
Pulled that eyesore down three
years ago. Feels good to give back.

478
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,870
I'm sure you relocated all the
people who got displaced, too.

479
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,090
The city contracted
me to redevelop here.

480
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:23,050
- Yeah,'cause you paid 'em off.
- But not everyone toed the line.

481
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,720
Dex Collins, for example.

482
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,500
Gave him a lot of money to back off.

483
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,390
Only he screwed you to the
wall with a press conference.

484
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,210
Almost ended this cash cow.

485
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,090
It's called the cost of doing business.

486
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,790
As you can see,
I ended up on top.

487
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,880
And Dex ended up dead.

488
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,840
Dex and I were straight.

489
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,210
First time in the history
of Philly politics that

490
00:24:43,211 --> 00:24:45,211
a candidate actually
gave money back.

491
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,720
Dex returned the 50 grand ?

492
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:49,090
Guy was sincere,
I'll give him that.

493
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:52,450
- But a bit too naive for his own good.
- Because he was on the up-and-up ?

494
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:56,330
Because he didn't know that his campaign
manager was taking cash from everyone

495
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,460
and putting it on the street.

496
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,340
Cassie Michaels told us they
never took a penny of street money.

497
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,180
Well, then she lied.

498
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,880
I don't care how charismatic you are.

499
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,230
In ward politics,

500
00:25:07,231 --> 00:25:10,031
the bosses don't lift a finger
without getting paid.

501
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,910
Cassie went behind his back ?

502
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:14,940
The guy ran his whole campaign
on doing things different.

503
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:17,190
He just didn't know what
the other hand was doing.

504
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,810
So, he gave you your money back ?

505
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,620
Figured he found out
what she was up to.

506
00:25:20,721 --> 00:25:22,321
Isn't that why he fired her ?

507
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,670
What's up with this new DA ?

508
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,530
Waiting half an hour to start a lineup
for our straw purchaser Quincy.

509
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,531
Bell's nowhere.

510
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,960
- Who is this jackass anyway ?
- Bell's good people.

511
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,870
His dad was a cop.
Killed in the line.

512
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,620
Car broke down.

513
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:55,990
Recognize any of them, Jay ?

514
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,460
Hard to say.They all look alike.

515
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:01,780
Let's pretend for a minute that
your mom's life depended on it

516
00:26:01,781 --> 00:26:03,981
because it kind of does.

517
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,680
Number four.

518
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,680
Wasn't hard to say, after all.

519
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:21,030
You held back about the street money.

520
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,830
Dex wasn't taking it,
but you were.

521
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:27,160
- Well,I was doing my job.
- That how Dex saw it ?

522
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,170
- Going behind his back.
- He understood.

523
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,110
That why he let you go ?

524
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,930
I was good at my job,
and he knew that.

525
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,440
Well, it was more than that.

526
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,940
I did some background on you two.

527
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,240
You met at Yale.
Shared an apartment.

528
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,140
- Yeah, we were friends.
- With benefits, right ?

529
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,010
- But the relationship changed.
- We went in different directions.

530
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,780
Yet you drop everything
when he calls.

531
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,520
Okay.

532
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:53,830
What do you want me to say ?

533
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:57,400
You want me to say that I still had
a thing for Dex ? So what if I did ?

534
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,410
It had to be tough.

535
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:03,670
Him wanting you in his camp,
just not on his arm.

536
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,810
Not in his neighborhood,
at least.

537
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,810
You know, in my experience,

538
00:27:12,011 --> 00:27:16,211
top motives for murder :
love and money.

539
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:20,210
- I didn't kill Dex.
- Which was worse, Cassie ?

540
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,880
Getting fired or dumped ?

541
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,900
I was protecting him from himself.

542
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,960
Dex was a saint.But he never understood.

543
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,150
Saints don't win elections.

544
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:33,130
We are about to take down the most
powerful member of the city council.

545
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:35,070
That wouldn't happen
without street money.

546
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,640
You don't get it, Cass.

547
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,480
It doesn't count if
we play by their rules.

548
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:42,230
Says who ? Where is it written that
Dex Collins can't work the system ?

549
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,760
The system's broken.

550
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,900
I am trying to show people
we don't need it anymore.

551
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48,840
Your ideals are nothing if
you lose. They're nothing.

552
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:52,440
That is why I'm here.
Because I keep you grounded.

553
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,370
I put you in the game.

554
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,640
I didn't ask you to.

555
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:58,350
You think you've done this alone ?

556
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,260
If it wasn't for me, you would still be the
most popular activist on "Sixth Street".

557
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:10,070
Instead, you are a political presence.

558
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:13,170
Just imagine what we can do.

559
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,840
You can't be a part of this anymore.

560
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,040
There's a reporter on the
phone from theInquirer.

561
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,730
Wants a comment from Dex
about a story for tomorrow.

562
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:33,380
Has to do with June 13,1987.

563
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,160
I'm sorry. That supposed
to mean something ?

564
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,470
What did the reporter have ?

565
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,300
He never said.

566
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,370
Dex kept things from me,too.

567
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,640
And a day later, he was dead.

568
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:53,330
Yeah, that's not good enough. Cassie,
you were his campaign manager.

569
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,100
His friend.You saying
you never found out ?

570
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,880
Yeah.

571
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:01,000
Unfortunately, I did.

572
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,110
I've been meaning to tell you
how much I admired your son.

573
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:20,000
Of course, no one's perfect.

574
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,870
'Cause in 1987, Dex was
arrested for dealing drugs.

575
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,150
Just like the rest, looking
to bring my son down.

576
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,100
I'm looking for the truth.

577
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,610
- Why didn't you tell me ?
- It would have given you an excuse to walk away.

578
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,740
You owe Dex more than
just sitting vigil for him.

579
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,450
Tell me what happened.

580
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,040
Cops come to my house
one morning.

581
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:52,990
Say they busted Dex for
slinging dope the night before.

582
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:59,230
I said, "No, sir, not my son.
You must have got it wrong."

583
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,760
But they were right.

584
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:09,220
13 years old,
and they got him in lockup.

585
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,400
Judge suspended the charges
because of my boy's academics.

586
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:21,820
Yeah,did everything I could
to keep him off the street.

587
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,730
Street still killed him in the end.

588
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,870
Juvenile record's sealed, but
a reporter found out anyway.

589
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:32,720
Any idea who else could
have told him, Ronnie ?

590
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,690
Oh, yeah.

591
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,170
Dex's juvenile record.

592
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:42,000
Picked up for distribution
of cocaine, June '87.

593
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,790
You were with him.

594
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:46,170
Dex got off.His father made a deal.

595
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:49,650
Sent him away to a fancy school.
But not you, Victor.

596
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,600
Nah, I took the full hit.

597
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:55,130
24 months at Glen Mills
Youth Detention Center.

598
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,900
These cords are sealed.
Public has no access to them.

599
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:00,610
So tell me how the Inquirer
found out about it.

600
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,600
You charging me ?

601
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,510
Only other person who'd remember.

602
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,420
Only one who can confirm it.
You.

603
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,650
Charge me
if you're gonna charge me.

604
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,160
Call Boone,
tell him the job's done.

605
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,670
Oh, you think I answer to Boone ?

606
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,780
You police,ain't you ?

607
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:23,000
I answer to him.

608
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,070
You were pissed at Dex for dodging
the bullet all those years ago.

609
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,000
Making something of himself.

610
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,380
- He gave me a second chance.
- Right.

611
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:33,660
As his errand boy.

612
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,420
What else was I good for ?

613
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,440
Exactly. You were nothing
but a thug.

614
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,020
Thought you'd take him down a notch.

615
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,440
Remind everyone exactly
what street Dex comes from.

616
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:45,340
But what I can't figure out, Victor :
why you had to shoot him, too.

617
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:50,280
I was so high that night, I
barely rember what was happening.

618
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,830
Go the hell away !

619
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,700
I told you. I...

620
00:31:56,301 --> 00:31:58,001
I thought you was a reporter.

621
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,760
Where have you been ?

622
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,660
In here not feeling too good.

623
00:32:03,661 --> 00:32:07,461
<i>"The Boogie Man"
by Mos Def.</i>

624
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:10,630
Any more ?

625
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,900
Look,I ain't ever had
nobody looking out for me.

626
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,820
Hey,drop that self-pity routine.

627
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,250
The reporter just came.

628
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,560
They wanted me to know about what happened
between us back in the day, you know ?

629
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,340
I didn't say a word,
but gave me money anyway.

630
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,670
Doesn't matter, Victor.

631
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,820
I said nothing.I don't even
know how they found out.

632
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,740
It was Boone.

633
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:32,850
Someone slipped these
under my door this morning.

634
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,310
Thought it was you.

635
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,720
Boone keeps pushing and pushing.

636
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:42,760
I'm sick of it.

637
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:46,290
This ends tonight.

638
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:48,720
- What are you gonna do ?
- Talk to Boone.

639
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:52,330
He's got dirt on me,
and I've got dirt on him.

640
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,740
Photo showed Boone
with a woman ?

641
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,690
Stripper from the Oasis Club.

642
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:07,740
He was doing her for months while his
wife was sick and dying in the hospital.

643
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,460
A man of the people, my ass.

644
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,050
When exactly did Dex
go to see Boone ?

645
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,520
A few hours before he died.

646
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,390
And you never told ?

647
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,260
A guy like Dex.

648
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,200
High-profile, respected.

649
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,740
Gunned down like a dog.

650
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:28,580
What do you think they'll
do to a guy like me ?

651
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,990
Patrick.

652
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,140
They're towing my damn car.

653
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,280
Jeez.

654
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:58,050
Where did you find a parking
employee with the balls

655
00:33:58,051 --> 00:34:00,051
to tow my car ?

656
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,730
You've got your people,
I've got mine.

657
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,660
- Let's talk about Dex Collins.
- Why would I do that ?

658
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,180
Because Doherty's wife works
admin at a juvenile court.

659
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:12,870
You had her look into Dex's sealed
record,leak it toThe Inquirer.

660
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,450
You can do better than that.

661
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,630
I also have a witness placing you
with Dex the night he was murdered.

662
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:19,940
Maybe I should call my lawyers.

663
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:22,670
Well, then we're talking
headlines, Grover.

664
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,890
Being a suspect in a murder investigation
doesn't really help

665
00:34:25,891 --> 00:34:27,291
when you're making
a run at mayor.

666
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,980
You know, I never knew
you to be political, John.

667
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,270
If you'd played ball
a few years ago,

668
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:33,871
you'd be head
of the department now.

669
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,260
This isn't politics.

670
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,850
Everything's politics.

671
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:44,280
But since I like you,
I'm going to give you ten minutes.

672
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:46,200
Ask your questions.

673
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:49,960
Dex came to you the night he died.
He had some photographs.

674
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,610
I was expecting a showdown.

675
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,480
But the boy had a way
of surprising you.

676
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:57,860
You had a...

677
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,950
tough day in the press.

678
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,300
It's only going to get tougher.

679
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:06,580
Unless... you've come to surrender.

680
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,780
You should probably
avoid the Oasis Club.

681
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,070
At least while your
wife's in the hospital.

682
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,570
Hmm,that's like telling
a dog not to bark.

683
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,000
Everyone has something.

684
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,000
Even you.

685
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,130
Let me tell my wife first.

686
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,190
I don't want her to
see this in the news.

687
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:42,430
I'm giving these back to you.

688
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,630
We're wasting time beating
each other to a pulp.

689
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,390
And what do you propose ?

690
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,000
You kill the newspaper story,

691
00:35:50,001 --> 00:35:52,501
I kill the photos, no more smear jobs.

692
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:53,720
How do I know
there aren't more copies ?

693
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:56,930
You don't. So let's be
the good guys, Grover.

694
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,970
I absolutely underestimated you.

695
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:09,220
You know, if the roles were reversed,
I wouldn't pay you the courtesy.

696
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,840
I know.

697
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,860
So why are you doing it ?

698
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:15,910
'Cause I'm gonna beat you anyway.

699
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,700
All my years in politics,
I never met anyone like him.

700
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,450
Kind of wish he was still around.

701
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,610
It would've made life interesting.

702
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:29,990
You couldn't last 30 years on the city
council without knowing your enemies.

703
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,220
You ever find out
who took the photos ?

704
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,390
No one in my campaign.

705
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,500
I'm curious, Grover,

706
00:36:35,501 --> 00:36:40,301
if Dex had lived, would you have
killed the news story ?

707
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,140
Looks like your ten minutes are up.

708
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,260
We'll do it again real soon.

709
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,610
Something kicked up on your suspect
from the lineup, Jorge Gomez.

710
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,700
Turns out this isn't his first arrest.

711
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,410
I ran his name, no felonies.

712
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:12,210
But he's got a misdemeanor.
Drunk and disorder in '04.

713
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,170
Held overnight on $500 bail.

714
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,970
His boss at the time bailed him out.

715
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,440
His boss ?

716
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,740
Owner of the Diamond Diner.

717
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,830
You're no career criminal, Warren.

718
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,570
If you were,you wouldn't ask three other
employees where to buy a gun

719
00:37:29,571 --> 00:37:31,271
before Jorge Gomez.

720
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,640
Or you'd have thought to
toss it in the Schuylkill.

721
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,100
Not in a drain pipe half
a block from Dex's body.

722
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,710
Checked your story for that night.

723
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,680
Bartending at the Oasis.

724
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,580
But the manager says you
clocked you out early.

725
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:44,680
Alibi's shot ; got you with the gun,
it's premeditated murder.

726
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,770
You're looking at life.

727
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,480
That gun was for protection.

728
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,400
That's not how you used it.

729
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,270
You know, the thing
about the Oasis Club ?

730
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,380
That's where those blackmail
photos of Boone were taken.

731
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,600
See, what I don't get,

732
00:37:57,601 --> 00:38:00,201
why put your neck out for Dex
taking those photos,

733
00:38:00,202 --> 00:38:01,402
then get a gun to kill him ?

734
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,090
That's not how it happened.

735
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,600
You going to have to
explain it to us then,Warren.

736
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,040
So we can help you.

737
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,910
Give us something for the DA.

738
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,410
Do 20 years instead.

739
00:38:13,411 --> 00:38:16,211
Get some time with your family
at the other end.

740
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:20,580
I got a right to support a
candidate without being harassed.

741
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,860
Well, sure,
as long as it's Boone.

742
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:25,190
Yeah, but Boone put the screws
to you.

743
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:27,240
He used everything
in his arsenal :

744
00:38:27,241 --> 00:38:29,941
the health department,
even the cops.

745
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,700
He was out for blood.

746
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,220
He had people watching me.

747
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,980
It's why I got the gun.

748
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:39,020
Sure.

749
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:43,450
Position you were in, hey,
I'd have done the same.

750
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:45,580
All that rage,

751
00:38:45,881 --> 00:38:47,981
but why take it out
on the wrong guy ?

752
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,510
This epic dogfight
between him and Boone,

753
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,770
and you're caught in the middle,
over your head.

754
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,390
I couldn't think straight.
I couldn't sleep anymore.

755
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:00,600
And Dex wouldn't...

756
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,270
What ? What happened ?

757
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:04,790
What made you turn ?

758
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,000
All that talk about looking
in the mirror,

759
00:39:13,001 --> 00:39:16,201
seeing faith...
that was powerful stuff.

760
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,380
That's what hooked you
onto Dex, right ?

761
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,270
So let me ask you,

762
00:39:20,271 --> 00:39:23,271
when you look
in the mirror now...

763
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,220
what do you see ?

764
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,370
I see Dex.

765
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,900
Dex.

766
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:48,810
There you are.

767
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:50,930
Where have you been ?

768
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:54,530
Look at this. No dealers.
No buyers.

769
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,480
Boone had the cops sweep the block.

770
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,020
Today, Sixth Street.

771
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,370
Tomorrow, Seventh, the Eighth,
the whole district...

772
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,830
What happened with Boone ?

773
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:08,250
I wish I could've seen his
face when he got those photos.

774
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,210
It was you ?

775
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,860
You're messing with
the wrong guy, Warren.

776
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,920
That's why I got this.

777
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,830
Anyway, who cares ?
We are gonna win now !

778
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,450
Dex...

779
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:29,800
You didn't use the photos ?

780
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:32,110
We don't have a chance without them.

781
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,780
Look, we're in a dead heat
right now.

782
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:37,150
But if we don't pull it out this
time, we'll get him next time.

783
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:40,400
Next time is four years from now.

784
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,450
I don't have four weeks !

785
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,380
Boone's taken my restaurant.

786
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,130
I can't pay my bills.

787
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,920
Now what's he going to
do to me when you lose ?

788
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:54,030
Warren, I guarantee you,
he stays away.

789
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,490
You cut a deal.

790
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,640
What'd Boone offer ?

791
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,560
Clean up your street ?

792
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,710
Run you in another district ?

793
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,530
Or was it a straight-up payoff ?

794
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,400
No, it's not like that.

795
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,070
I should've known.

796
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,320
You're just like the rest.
All crooks !

797
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,970
- Sellouts !
- Warren, for God's sake...

798
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:22,700
- And I'm the one who gets screwed !
- Listen ! Listen, man !
