00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:16,181
You can barely tell.

4
00:00:17,526 --> 00:00:18,753
I'm flying.

5
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:21,995
Good as new. Look.

6
00:00:22,807 --> 00:00:24,009
Todd's sick of me.

7
00:00:24,614 --> 00:00:25,982
So maybe you're sick of him.

8
00:00:25,982 --> 00:00:27,549
Let's go back to Tim's room.

9
00:00:27,549 --> 00:00:29,062
He's cooler than any of them.

10
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:30,379
You really want to?

11
00:00:31,302 --> 00:00:32,893
Maybe later.

12
00:00:52,364 --> 00:00:54,200
You're not supposed to have people here.

13
00:00:55,094 --> 00:00:55,917
Who says?

14
00:00:55,917 --> 00:00:57,414
Your mom and dad.

15
00:00:57,414 --> 00:00:59,181
You're gonna call them in Jakarta?

16
00:00:59,181 --> 00:01:01,878
Give the lady a beer for her silence.

17
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:03,053
Is Jill coming?

18
00:01:03,635 --> 00:01:04,975
What do you think?

19
00:01:04,975 --> 00:01:05,677
I saw her today.

20
00:01:05,677 --> 00:01:07,587
She said maybe, maybe not.

21
00:01:07,587 --> 00:01:09,275
Please.

22
00:01:09,275 --> 00:01:10,503
She's coming.

23
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:12,484
Who's gonna clean 
this up in the morning?

24
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:15,293
Go watch TV, Bonita.

25
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:18,974
There she is.

26
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:22,510
Oh, hi, gorgeous.

Yeah.

How you doing, Detectives?

00:02:59,574 --> 00:03:02,502
Trash still here, chairs on the floor.

42
00:03:02,502 --> 00:03:03,730
They hadn't closed yet.

43
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,476
Eight years on the line,

44
00:03:05,724 --> 00:03:06,644
never had a triple.

45
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,201
Last out gets the action.

46
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:09,538
This an overnighter?

47
00:03:09,538 --> 00:03:11,258
Kid who opens up found this morning.

48
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:12,187
Looks like a straight robbery?

49
00:03:12,187 --> 00:03:13,719
Go talk to the scene man, kid.

50
00:03:14,143 --> 00:03:15,028
Register's raided.

51
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,210
Let's get it dusted.

52
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:22,923
It's a bad case of death.

53
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:25,979
All three shot.

54
00:03:26,612 --> 00:03:27,889
Her throat's cut.

55
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:29,479
Doer's got a gun.

56
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:31,203
Why's he gotta slit her throat, too?

57
00:03:31,203 --> 00:03:33,155
Um, Detective?

58
00:03:34,018 --> 00:03:35,905
When you dust the register...

59
00:03:35,905 --> 00:03:38,036
We might find your prints?

60
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:42,257
That's why we keep our hands full.

61
00:03:42,758 --> 00:03:45,777
All right, I'm knocking on some doors.

62
00:03:45,777 --> 00:03:47,159
We boring you in here?

63
00:03:47,778 --> 00:03:48,987
Stillman called.

64
00:03:48,987 --> 00:03:51,201
There's a civilian down at 
Central, wants to talk to you.

65
00:03:51,201 --> 00:03:51,977
Me?

66
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:54,810
Asked for a lady in Homicide.

67
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:08,262
I hear you were in the Badlands.

68
00:04:08,262 --> 00:04:10,045
Della's Chicken and Ribs.

69
00:04:10,247 --> 00:04:11,891
What's the deal with this civilian?

70
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:13,109
Civilian?

71
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:14,657
Probably some nut job.

72
00:04:14,657 --> 00:04:16,090
Vera said that he, uh...

73
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,924
I told Vera to deal with her.

74
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:18,994
I've been on since midnight.

75
00:04:18,994 --> 00:04:20,185
I got three murders to solve,

76
00:04:20,185 --> 00:04:21,833
and he's pawning his 
dog calls off on me?

77
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:22,713
I know, Lil.

78
00:04:23,405 --> 00:04:24,751
He is one pain in the ass, boss.

79
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:26,306
Yeah, look, she's right outside.

80
00:04:26,306 --> 00:04:27,680
Just chase her demons away.

81
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,061
Your triple's not gonna 
go anywhere, all right?

82
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,627
You better give Vera some hell.

83
00:04:30,627 --> 00:04:32,149
Like it would do any good.

84
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:44,569
Detective Rush. Homicide.

85
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:48,576
You do murders?

86
00:04:48,576 --> 00:04:50,693
I investigate murders.

87
00:04:52,387 --> 00:04:54,321
I want to tell you about one.

88
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,275
What's your name?

89
00:04:58,776 --> 00:05:00,189
Bonita...

90
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:02,559
Bonita Rafaela.

91
00:05:03,877 --> 00:05:06,313
You been smoking some 
pot today, Bonita?

92
00:05:07,044 --> 00:05:08,517
It helps with the pain.

93
00:05:09,495 --> 00:05:11,238
I've got cancer.

94
00:05:12,968 --> 00:05:13,942
Sorry.

95
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,319
I saw a murder.

96
00:05:20,744 --> 00:05:23,967
A girl was killed on a tennis court.

97
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,832
Where's the court?

98
00:05:26,832 --> 00:05:28,404
Chestnut Hill.

99
00:05:29,272 --> 00:05:31,955
At the house where I used to work.

100
00:05:33,227 --> 00:05:35,691
The boys were having a party.

101
00:05:59,636 --> 00:06:02,145
He hit her...

102
00:06:03,058 --> 00:06:04,874
over and over

103
00:06:04,874 --> 00:06:06,815
and over and over.

104
00:06:07,376 --> 00:06:09,149
You didn't call the police?

105
00:06:09,927 --> 00:06:11,709
I went to bed.

106
00:06:12,434 --> 00:06:14,296
I thought it wasn't my business.

107
00:06:14,296 --> 00:06:16,809
A girl dying wasn't your business?

108
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:20,081
And when did this happen?

109
00:06:20,908 --> 00:06:23,139
In 1976.

110
00:06:24,087 --> 00:06:27,026
1976, Bonita?

111
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:28,841
27 years ago,

112
00:06:28,841 --> 00:06:31,088
and you're just telling this now?

113
00:06:31,584 --> 00:06:33,107
I had a son.

114
00:06:33,882 --> 00:06:35,499
I needed to work.

115
00:06:36,322 --> 00:06:39,032
But now I have this cancer.

116
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,744
Something die in here?

117
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:54,992
Whew...These cases.

118
00:06:54,992 --> 00:06:56,387
The timing adds up.

119
00:06:56,387 --> 00:06:58,156
Jill Shelby, beaten 
at a neighbor's house,

120
00:06:58,156 --> 00:06:59,085
found the next morning.

121
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,380
Case was never solved.

122
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,372
Yeah, like the rest of these job.

123
00:07:02,372 --> 00:07:03,827
But now we got a witness.

124
00:07:04,494 --> 00:07:05,713
Are you saying we should open

125
00:07:05,713 --> 00:07:07,610
a 27-year-old case, Lil?

126
00:07:08,106 --> 00:07:09,513
There's new direction.

127
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:11,264
Yeah, witnesses from that long ago

128
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,912
are gonna be pretty shaky.

129
00:07:12,912 --> 00:07:15,300
Maybe. But then, 
time can be on our side.

130
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,170
People who wouldn't talk then

131
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,614
might be willing to now.

132
00:07:18,116 --> 00:07:18,992
Look at this maid.

133
00:07:18,992 --> 00:07:19,535
Mm-hmm.

134
00:07:19,535 --> 00:07:21,062
I mean, time passes.

135
00:07:21,062 --> 00:07:21,896
People's loyalties

136
00:07:21,896 --> 00:07:23,779
and circumstances change.

137
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,353
Do you believe this maid?

138
00:07:25,353 --> 00:07:27,779
Yeah, I do.

139
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,923
I don't know the assigned detective.

140
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:32,594
Britt.

141
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:35,088
I bet Jeffries does.

142
00:07:42,735 --> 00:07:44,551
Britt was top shelf.

143
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:46,974
Got killed in Camden trying 
to pick up a fugitive.

144
00:07:46,974 --> 00:07:49,484
So he's not the reason 
the job went cold.

145
00:07:49,484 --> 00:07:51,559
Uh-uh. And I remember this one.

146
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:52,953
It made him crazy.

147
00:07:52,953 --> 00:07:53,482
The girl's mother

148
00:07:53,482 --> 00:07:56,152
would come in year after year,

149
00:07:56,152 --> 00:07:58,118
Britt never had anything for her.

150
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:00,535
who'd he look at for the doer?

151
00:08:00,535 --> 00:08:03,028
The two brothers, 
one being the boyfriend.

152
00:08:03,028 --> 00:08:05,054
A live-in cook made the list.

153
00:08:05,054 --> 00:08:05,802
And, of course,

154
00:08:05,802 --> 00:08:07,587
some folks thought 
a gang of black kids

155
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:10,437
must have come to 
Chestnut Hill that night.

156
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:13,307
The boyfriend his top pick?

157
00:08:13,307 --> 00:08:14,197
Yeah, it was rumored

158
00:08:14,197 --> 00:08:15,622
he had been violent with her.

159
00:08:15,622 --> 00:08:17,075
Todd Whitley?

160
00:08:17,075 --> 00:08:18,184
Oh, yeah.

161
00:08:18,184 --> 00:08:20,159
Cocky little jerk, as I recall.

162
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:21,866
From a society family.

163
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:24,900
No one would talk about those boys.

164
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,555
The old man was too powerful.

165
00:08:27,555 --> 00:08:30,241
Put up walls Britt 
couldn't even get past.

166
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:32,959
Someone should read the job again.

167
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,133
Maybe those walls are shakier now.

168
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,244
How about you?

169
00:08:38,146 --> 00:08:39,232
I got a job.

170
00:08:39,734 --> 00:08:40,758
But Vera might get a sense

171
00:08:40,758 --> 00:08:42,335
of achivement out of it.

172
00:08:42,335 --> 00:08:43,804
You spoke to the maid, Lil.

173
00:08:43,804 --> 00:08:45,722
Only 'cause he stuck me with her.

174
00:08:47,703 --> 00:08:49,634
This job deserves another look

175
00:08:49,634 --> 00:08:51,965
and Vera doesn't have 
the type of personality

176
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:54,524
to get anywhere with society people.

177
00:08:58,911 --> 00:09:00,608
You give Vera my triple,

178
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:03,252
you're gonna find him 
in Della's freezer.

179
00:09:16,383 --> 00:09:18,586
Excuse me, is Evelyn Shelby here?

180
00:09:19,172 --> 00:09:20,613
I'm Evelyn.

181
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,834
Hi. Lilly Rush.

182
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:28,871
How'd you find this house?

183
00:09:28,871 --> 00:09:32,536
Well, I'm a Detective Homicide.

184
00:09:34,403 --> 00:09:36,662
Is it about someone who stayed here?

185
00:09:38,195 --> 00:09:39,816
No, um...

186
00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:42,517
it's about your daughter.

187
00:09:45,341 --> 00:09:47,587
A witness has come forward in her case.

188
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,339
Someone who worked in the neighborhood.

189
00:09:51,903 --> 00:09:54,139
So you don't know anything.

190
00:09:54,515 --> 00:09:56,499
We have new direction.

191
00:09:56,842 --> 00:10:00,375
Look, I came into Homicide every August,

192
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,095
for over 20 years.

193
00:10:02,095 --> 00:10:04,394
Eventually, I figured 
out that Detective Britt

194
00:10:04,394 --> 00:10:05,632
was too much of a gentleman

195
00:10:05,632 --> 00:10:07,711
to tell me to stop coming,

196
00:10:07,711 --> 00:10:08,283
that her case

197
00:10:08,283 --> 00:10:09,933
would never be solved.

198
00:10:10,701 --> 00:10:12,885
You can only hope so long.

199
00:10:12,885 --> 00:10:14,924
So I should just forget about Jill?

200
00:10:16,228 --> 00:10:17,137
How about Todd Whitley?

201
00:10:17,137 --> 00:10:18,696
Should I forget him, too?

202
00:10:18,696 --> 00:10:20,884
Todd was lovely to Jill.

203
00:10:20,884 --> 00:10:24,152
Really, I... hear he 
knocked her around.

204
00:10:24,619 --> 00:10:26,401
What's lovely about that?

205
00:10:26,747 --> 00:10:29,700
I still see Todd Whitley... 
and Melanie.

206
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,315
They're married now.

207
00:10:31,974 --> 00:10:33,180
Melanie...

208
00:10:34,214 --> 00:10:35,938
Jill's best friend?

209
00:10:36,613 --> 00:10:39,366
They became close after she died.

210
00:10:39,366 --> 00:10:40,623
And I'm not interested

211
00:10:40,623 --> 00:10:44,048
in stirring up more 
accusations against him.

212
00:10:46,076 --> 00:10:48,157
Well, I'm reopening the case.

213
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,839
I'm not saying don't do your job.

214
00:10:51,588 --> 00:10:53,973
It's just that no one's 
been able to solve it

215
00:10:53,973 --> 00:10:56,108
after all these years.

216
00:10:58,104 --> 00:11:03,532
And... and I-I just can't 
get pulled in again.

217
00:11:17,068 --> 00:11:17,880
What kind of person

218
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,828
doesn't wanna solve

219
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:20,659
her daughter's murder?

220
00:11:21,943 --> 00:11:23,913
Someone in a lot of pain?

221
00:11:23,913 --> 00:11:25,093
Well, she won't help me with Todd,

222
00:11:25,093 --> 00:11:26,652
she thinks he's a golden boy.

223
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:28,796
And the best friend's married to him.

224
00:11:28,796 --> 00:11:30,349
That's a tight inner circle.

225
00:11:30,349 --> 00:11:32,661
So Jill's own mom isn't on board,

226
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,879
who's this for?

227
00:11:39,097 --> 00:11:41,385
You working a dead case 
instead of our triple?

228
00:11:41,385 --> 00:11:42,372
Talk to him.

229
00:11:42,372 --> 00:11:44,122
Unsolved isn't dead, Las.

230
00:11:44,122 --> 00:11:45,983
And she's got direction. Don't you?

231
00:11:46,436 --> 00:11:49,338
Yeah, but I also got three 
murders at this restaurant.

232
00:11:49,338 --> 00:11:50,160
All right.

233
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,928
Who else can you go to on this?

234
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:53,353
Well, not Melanie.

235
00:11:53,353 --> 00:11:55,032
So I guess that leaves the brothers.

236
00:11:55,032 --> 00:11:56,718
What was their party line on the abuse?

237
00:11:56,718 --> 00:11:59,727
The party line was 
don't talk to the cops.

238
00:11:59,727 --> 00:12:00,959
Going out on the street, boss.

239
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:01,823
Right.

240
00:12:01,823 --> 00:12:03,163
Neighborhood survey on Della's.

241
00:12:03,163 --> 00:12:03,849
You coming or not?

242
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:06,955
Let me just work this one for 
one more interview, then I'm back.

243
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:08,609
Great.

244
00:12:09,205 --> 00:12:10,532
All right, what's your 
play with the brothers?

245
00:12:10,532 --> 00:12:12,870
Well, Todd's a superstar lawyer now.

246
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,967
Eric is more of a fringe case.

247
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:19,607
Divorced, drinking problem, 
doesn't exactly work.

248
00:12:20,257 --> 00:12:22,525
Sounds like he's your first stop.

249
00:12:43,785 --> 00:12:44,911
Eric?

250
00:12:45,287 --> 00:12:46,599
Yeah?

251
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,048
Detective Rush.

252
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:50,637
I'm heading out. I have a meeting.

253
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:52,866
There's a 1:00 in Old City.

254
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,912
It's not that kind of meeting.

255
00:12:56,929 --> 00:12:58,053
Oh.

256
00:12:58,309 --> 00:12:59,718
Um..I'm..It'll just take a few minutes.

257
00:12:59,718 --> 00:13:01,818
It's about Jill Shelby.

258
00:13:02,636 --> 00:13:04,217
You were in school with her, right?

259
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:05,694
Chelsea Day?

260
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,010
I can't talk to you.

261
00:13:10,562 --> 00:13:11,917
How come?

262
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:14,825
They treated my brother and 
me like suspects back then.

263
00:13:14,825 --> 00:13:16,563
Well, it was an open secret

264
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,378
Todd was hitting Jill.

265
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:22,953
He loved Jill.

266
00:13:22,953 --> 00:13:25,240
People hit people they love.

267
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,177
I shouldn't say anymore.

268
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,303
Maybe you could just 
tell me what she was like.

269
00:13:34,843 --> 00:13:36,238
She was nice.

270
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:41,006
When you were alone 
with her, at least.

271
00:13:41,006 --> 00:13:42,479
When you weren't alone?

272
00:13:45,118 --> 00:13:46,712
I don't wanna speak ill of the dead.

273
00:13:46,712 --> 00:13:48,733
It's okay. I hear it every day.

274
00:13:51,505 --> 00:13:52,728
She'd ignore you.

275
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,243
She ignore you that night?

276
00:13:56,645 --> 00:13:58,505
She was at her worst at parties.

277
00:14:06,403 --> 00:14:07,596
I see dollar signs,

278
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,239
already, Charlie.

279
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:19,715
That was a $50 value.

280
00:14:19,715 --> 00:14:20,960
Thank you!

281
00:14:25,672 --> 00:14:26,673
Come on, Jill.

282
00:14:26,861 --> 00:14:29,170
Tell us what a kiss from Eric's worth.

283
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:30,980
I can't.

284
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:33,236
He's Todd's brother.

285
00:14:33,753 --> 00:14:35,862
You've already kissed two other guys.

286
00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:38,115
I'm not into it.

287
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,402
Come here, Eric.

288
00:14:51,614 --> 00:14:53,860
So she was kind of a 
bitch to you that night.

289
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,090
She didn't mean it.

290
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,749
That was the just 
way she got sometimes.

291
00:15:00,749 --> 00:15:02,361
Mmm.

292
00:15:03,979 --> 00:15:05,792
Anyway, I need to go.

293
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:08,285
Oh, did you letter in high school?

294
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,919
You look kind of athletic.

295
00:15:12,349 --> 00:15:13,617
One year.

296
00:15:15,255 --> 00:15:16,556
Wrestling.

297
00:15:22,781 --> 00:15:23,571
Todd Whitley.

298
00:15:23,571 --> 00:15:24,876
Lilly Rush.

299
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,938
Have a seat, Lilly.

300
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:31,157
Who'd you row for?

301
00:15:31,157 --> 00:15:33,151
Uh, Chelsea Day and Penn.

302
00:15:33,151 --> 00:15:35,315
I'm still on the water most mornings.

303
00:15:35,607 --> 00:15:36,852
Impressive.

304
00:15:37,357 --> 00:15:39,204
This is about Eric I assume.

305
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,509
You don't seem too shocked 
he might be in trouble.

306
00:15:42,494 --> 00:15:45,059
Patterns of behavior, right?

307
00:15:46,296 --> 00:15:47,808
Recognize her?

308
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:53,504
What is this?

309
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:56,089
A homicide investigation.

310
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:58,776
Look, that was painful 
for a lot of people.

311
00:15:59,422 --> 00:16:01,154
I suggest you leave it alone.

312
00:16:01,154 --> 00:16:02,402
I can't do that.

313
00:16:02,402 --> 00:16:04,159
It's an open case.

314
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,160
Why did someone like 
you become a cop?

315
00:16:09,743 --> 00:16:13,153
Oh, bad education, limited talent.

316
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,940
You should be married, 
living the good life.

317
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,478
Well, no one ever asked.

318
00:16:26,593 --> 00:16:29,625
So here I am working a homicide.

319
00:16:30,395 --> 00:16:32,273
Well, as I told the cops at the time,

320
00:16:32,273 --> 00:16:34,454
I was with my brother all night.

321
00:16:34,454 --> 00:16:35,532
Actually, a lawyer

322
00:16:35,532 --> 00:16:38,768
told them that in a statement
three weeks later.

323
00:16:38,768 --> 00:16:39,474
So?

324
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,939
Look... my father owned 
half of Philadelphia.

325
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:51,617
People like to see families 
like ours in trouble.

326
00:16:51,617 --> 00:16:53,593
We hired a lawyer.

327
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,189
Maybe your kind of people don't do that...

328
00:16:56,664 --> 00:16:57,940
mine do.

329
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,712
Even if there's nothing to hide?

330
00:16:59,712 --> 00:17:00,884
I can't help you anymore.

331
00:17:02,037 --> 00:17:04,243
I understand you're 
married to Melanie now.

332
00:17:04,243 --> 00:17:05,687
She can't help you either.

333
00:17:05,687 --> 00:17:08,564
Do you still have 
a problem with violence?

334
00:17:09,652 --> 00:17:10,427
I know you once hit

335
00:17:10,427 --> 00:17:14,130
Jill hard enough to give 
her three stitches and all.

336
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,196
Everyone knew the cops

337
00:17:15,196 --> 00:17:16,778
had it in for me over Jill.

338
00:17:17,716 --> 00:17:19,340
They were wrong then,

339
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,857
you are wrong now.

340
00:17:20,857 --> 00:17:22,146
Ever hit Melanie?

341
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:25,658
All right, Lilly,

342
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:27,756
you're right.

343
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:31,740
Someone did beat the crap out 
of Jill on a regular basis.

344
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,027
But It wasn't me.

345
00:17:33,706 --> 00:17:36,546
Her father was a real 
son of a bitch.

346
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,588
You sure know how to find people.

347
00:18:03,243 --> 00:18:05,450
I thought you'd still 
be living in Chestnut Hill.

348
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,941
I like the city.

349
00:18:08,943 --> 00:18:10,388
Did you find something?

350
00:18:10,388 --> 00:18:13,080
Autopsy records and medical records.

351
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,866
And?

352
00:18:13,866 --> 00:18:15,570
I just don't understand these injuries

353
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,090
Jill had before she died.

354
00:18:17,855 --> 00:18:18,849
Injuries?

355
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:21,140
Broken rib when she was 12....

356
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,610
a concussion ... a jaw 
fracture at nine years old.

357
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:25,842
What's the deal?

358
00:18:26,744 --> 00:18:29,242
She played field hockey and soccer.

359
00:18:29,668 --> 00:18:30,468
Uh-huh.

360
00:18:31,396 --> 00:18:33,132
She was very active.

361
00:18:33,823 --> 00:18:36,771
Evelyn, 
my ex-husband was a mean drunk.

362
00:18:36,771 --> 00:18:38,699
I know the difference 
between a soccer injury

363
00:18:38,699 --> 00:18:40,551
and a trip down the stairs.

364
00:18:43,124 --> 00:18:44,778
Did your husband beat your daughter?

365
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:47,621
He was in Houston the night she died.

366
00:18:47,621 --> 00:18:49,190
That wasn't my question.

367
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,331
He's been dead nine years.

368
00:18:52,721 --> 00:18:55,806
And now you work at a Shelter 
for battered women and children.

369
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:58,920
Where did you get that?

370
00:19:00,317 --> 00:19:01,383
The case file.

371
00:19:07,139 --> 00:19:09,193
I took this picture.

372
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,926
I don't see how you can 
just forget her, Evelyn.

373
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,719
Forget?

374
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:26,824
I think about her every day.

375
00:19:28,811 --> 00:19:30,540
This ruined my life.

376
00:19:31,116 --> 00:19:32,897
Then it still matters.

377
00:19:35,447 --> 00:19:36,553
I can't look back.

378
00:19:36,553 --> 00:19:38,108
It's too hard.

379
00:19:41,163 --> 00:19:43,103
So you sell your Chestnut Hill house,

380
00:19:43,103 --> 00:19:44,132
pack up your old life

381
00:19:44,132 --> 00:19:46,828
and-and think you can just walk away?

382
00:19:47,336 --> 00:19:49,884
You can't walk away from her, Eveylyn.

383
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:51,523
She's a part of you.

384
00:19:55,814 --> 00:19:57,493
There's now hope now.

385
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:02,189
And what if you don't solve it?

386
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:05,207
Where does that leave me?

387
00:20:07,002 --> 00:20:08,950
What if I do solve it?

388
00:20:27,282 --> 00:20:30,414
My husband doesn't 
want me talking to you.

389
00:20:31,206 --> 00:20:32,344
Todd doesn't want you helping

390
00:20:32,344 --> 00:20:34,473
with your best friend's 
murder investigation?

391
00:20:35,046 --> 00:20:36,912
I thought we put this to rest.

392
00:20:37,484 --> 00:20:39,423
It's important to me, Melly.

393
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:44,261
So you came to the party 
with Jill but left alone?

394
00:20:44,857 --> 00:20:46,015
I drank too much.

395
00:20:46,323 --> 00:20:48,375
I had to go home and I couldn't find her.

396
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,124
You made a big point

397
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:52,818
in your interview that 
you were sure it wasn't Todd.

398
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,513
The detective made a big 
point of asking about him.

399
00:20:55,513 --> 00:20:57,189
He was fixated on the Whitleys,

400
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,780
but barely looked at Tim Dorn.

401
00:20:59,771 --> 00:21:01,074
This is the cook?

402
00:21:01,074 --> 00:21:02,357
He lived in our guest house,

403
00:21:02,357 --> 00:21:03,011
and he was with

404
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,633
the girls that night.

405
00:21:04,884 --> 00:21:06,439
When we left for the party,

406
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:10,089
he told Jill she should 
come by later if she wanted.

407
00:21:10,089 --> 00:21:10,998
When I heard she was missing

408
00:21:10,998 --> 00:21:12,230
the next day,

409
00:21:12,685 --> 00:21:15,362
Tim was the first person I thought of.

410
00:21:19,775 --> 00:21:20,727
All this information

411
00:21:20,727 --> 00:21:22,115
and I got one page on the guy

412
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,324
the mother and best 
friend think did it.

413
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:26,898
You gotta listen to the best friend.

414
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:30,254
Teenage girls tell 
each other everything.

415
00:21:30,562 --> 00:21:32,078
Well, Britt wrote 
two sentences on him,

416
00:21:32,078 --> 00:21:34,506
then blew him off.

417
00:21:35,198 --> 00:21:37,721
It's hard to tell if he 
even worked him hard enough.

418
00:21:37,721 --> 00:21:40,015
Especially when he had it out for Todd.

419
00:21:42,748 --> 00:21:44,319
Dorn's up in Frackville.

420
00:21:45,042 --> 00:21:46,137
Locked up?

421
00:21:48,434 --> 00:21:49,933
Why do you think he's 
gonna talk to you?

422
00:21:50,882 --> 00:21:52,243
I'm an optimist.

423
00:21:53,221 --> 00:21:56,185
Lil, I got a wife at home.

424
00:21:56,185 --> 00:21:57,672
You don't have to come.

425
00:21:57,672 --> 00:21:59,060
You think it's a dead case.

426
00:22:02,499 --> 00:22:04,151
Let me just call her.

427
00:22:07,203 --> 00:22:08,684
Five years for forgery.

428
00:22:09,747 --> 00:22:13,204
I got a facility for it,
gets me into trouble.

429
00:22:13,956 --> 00:22:16,671
You ever dabble in more serious crime?

430
00:22:16,671 --> 00:22:19,161
Like the violence done to Jill Shelby?

431
00:22:19,161 --> 00:22:20,069
No, Ma'am.

432
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:22,730
I'm strictly a cerebral criminal.

433
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,624
Pretty attractive, wasn't she?

434
00:22:25,624 --> 00:22:28,030
She was pretty cute, for a girl.

435
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,287
You did tell her to 
come over that night.

436
00:22:30,506 --> 00:22:33,965
She came over a lot to get high.

437
00:22:33,965 --> 00:22:37,004
She and her little 
vixen friend Melanie.

438
00:22:37,004 --> 00:22:39,702
Well, that little vixen 
thinks that you killed Jill.

439
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,726
Well, if you marry the prime suspect

440
00:22:42,726 --> 00:22:45,552
I guess you better 
point to someone else.

441
00:22:45,552 --> 00:22:47,953
Jill's mom also thinks you did it.

442
00:22:47,953 --> 00:22:50,997
A woman lives in a certain world.

443
00:22:50,997 --> 00:22:53,533
If the shining neighbor 
boy killed her daughter,

444
00:22:53,533 --> 00:22:55,718
that world's a lie.

445
00:22:55,718 --> 00:22:57,638
Britt has your alibi down here

446
00:22:57,638 --> 00:23:00,011
as going to bed at 10:00.

447
00:23:00,831 --> 00:23:03,767
I guess he must have kept his word.

448
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,507
Actually, I was with a... 
friend that night.

449
00:23:09,507 --> 00:23:10,869
What friend?

450
00:23:11,445 --> 00:23:13,007
Bobby Jordan.

451
00:23:13,007 --> 00:23:16,291
This big, luscious college
boy down the street.

452
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:20,220
Neither of us was 
exactly out and proud

453
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,393
at the time, so we asked Britt

454
00:23:22,393 --> 00:23:24,874
not to document the sleepover.

455
00:23:24,874 --> 00:23:26,331
Bobby's gonna confirm that?

456
00:23:26,858 --> 00:23:29,543
Well, I imagine he's 
come to terms by now.

457
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:33,334
Did Jill ever talk to you about Todd?

458
00:23:33,557 --> 00:23:36,568
Oh, sure. Those girls 
told me everything.

459
00:23:36,568 --> 00:23:38,588
Like what?

460
00:23:38,588 --> 00:23:40,584
Teenage drama.

461
00:23:40,584 --> 00:23:43,254
They even told me things 
they didn't tell each other.

462
00:23:44,392 --> 00:23:46,770
Like all the while Jill was fretting

463
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,833
that Todd doesn't treat her right,

464
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:52,224
Melanie was doing him on the side.

465
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,374
You can't be here.

466
00:24:11,374 --> 00:24:12,238
Gate was open.

467
00:24:12,238 --> 00:24:13,809
My partner, Chris Lassing.

468
00:24:14,267 --> 00:24:15,151
How you doing?

469
00:24:15,151 --> 00:24:16,708
Todd is furious at you.

470
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:17,701
Uh-oh.

471
00:24:17,701 --> 00:24:19,121
Thanks to you his brother came here

472
00:24:19,121 --> 00:24:22,888
last night, drunk, after 
six years of being sober.

473
00:24:22,888 --> 00:24:23,908
Eric did?

474
00:24:24,551 --> 00:24:26,273
Look, I've told you about Tim Dorn.

475
00:24:26,273 --> 00:24:28,414
Why do you have to keep bothering us?

476
00:24:28,414 --> 00:24:30,521
Dorn's alibi checked out.

477
00:24:30,521 --> 00:24:31,669
We know about you and Todd

478
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:33,376
stepping out on Jill back then.

479
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,416
I... I don't have to talk to you.

480
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:37,661
We have to arrest you?

481
00:24:38,037 --> 00:24:39,581
You don't want that, Lady.

482
00:24:39,581 --> 00:24:41,046
You should see our holding cell.

483
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,577
Your headband will get all dirty.

484
00:24:42,577 --> 00:24:44,365
Why does this matter?

485
00:24:44,365 --> 00:24:45,123
'Cause when you tell us

486
00:24:45,123 --> 00:24:46,868
one lie, Melanie, even if it's small,

487
00:24:46,868 --> 00:24:48,684
that makes us think 
you're hiding other things.

488
00:24:48,684 --> 00:24:50,807
Like whatever Todd did 
to Jill that night.

489
00:24:52,334 --> 00:24:54,213
It wasn't Todd, okay?

490
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,458
I know...

491
00:25:00,445 --> 00:25:02,767
because I was with him that night.

492
00:25:09,393 --> 00:25:10,775
That is some top.

493
00:25:13,314 --> 00:25:14,572
It's new.

494
00:25:15,357 --> 00:25:17,132
You look like, uh...

495
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:19,329
What?

496
00:25:20,308 --> 00:25:23,226
A patriotic street walker.

497
00:25:27,346 --> 00:25:29,139
It was in Seventeen.

498
00:25:38,948 --> 00:25:40,604
Why do you have to be a jerk?

499
00:25:41,265 --> 00:25:43,474
Why don't you go and comfort her?

500
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:50,166
You know, you could use 
some time in charm school.

501
00:25:50,911 --> 00:25:51,951
Could I?

502
00:25:53,673 --> 00:25:55,517
I could give you a tutorial...

503
00:25:57,165 --> 00:25:58,329
upstairs.

504
00:25:59,633 --> 00:26:01,138
What about Jill?

505
00:26:02,623 --> 00:26:03,866
What about her?

506
00:26:08,238 --> 00:26:10,355
I'm obviously not proud of it.

507
00:26:11,477 --> 00:26:14,065
It sounds like Eric had pretty
strong feelings for Jill.

508
00:26:15,393 --> 00:26:16,591
So?

509
00:26:16,591 --> 00:26:17,853
So, why'd he fall off the wagon

510
00:26:17,853 --> 00:26:19,835
just 'cause Jill's name came up?

511
00:27:10,107 --> 00:27:12,186
Two million people in this city,

512
00:27:13,353 --> 00:27:14,870
I gotta run into you?

513
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,421
You think I'm thrilled seeing you?

514
00:27:16,421 --> 00:27:17,098
All right, look,

515
00:27:17,098 --> 00:27:20,428
I'm sorry if I was 
obnoxious in your office.

516
00:27:20,428 --> 00:27:22,035
More than obnoxious.

517
00:27:22,035 --> 00:27:22,797
It's just the way that you

518
00:27:22,797 --> 00:27:24,375
were looking out for Eric. It was...

519
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,489
I hear he's drinking again.

520
00:27:28,489 --> 00:27:29,987
Don't talk about Eric.

521
00:27:30,321 --> 00:27:32,943
Todd, I know that you were 
with Melanie that night.

522
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:33,708
Excuse me?

523
00:27:34,218 --> 00:27:34,905
Which doesn't add up

524
00:27:34,905 --> 00:27:36,085
with you saying you were with Eric.

525
00:27:36,085 --> 00:27:38,659
So I figure that you just 
said that to protect him.

526
00:27:39,352 --> 00:27:42,442
Okay, let's say I was 
with Melanie that night.

527
00:27:42,442 --> 00:27:43,578
You can understand 
why I wouldn't want

528
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,777
the entire world knowing that, right?

529
00:27:45,777 --> 00:27:46,766
Right.

530
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:50,010
So why not just say 
that you were sleeping?

531
00:27:50,755 --> 00:27:52,677
Why give Eric an alibi?

532
00:27:52,677 --> 00:27:53,881
You should drop this.

533
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:54,768
Eric did it.

534
00:27:54,768 --> 00:27:55,886
That's why you can sleep at night

535
00:27:55,886 --> 00:27:57,993
and have a normal life, 
and he's a mess.

536
00:27:57,993 --> 00:27:58,919
You should just watch it.

537
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:00,568
When did the hard drinking start?

538
00:28:00,943 --> 00:28:01,753
After he killed her?

539
00:28:01,753 --> 00:28:03,884
I can make your life very difficult.

540
00:28:03,884 --> 00:28:05,176
Eric kills Jill...

541
00:28:05,176 --> 00:28:06,620
you clean up after him.

542
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,727
Brother's keeper ever 
since. Am I close?

543
00:28:10,064 --> 00:28:11,417
Tell me something, Lilly.

544
00:28:12,597 --> 00:28:16,921
What is the point of all of 
this after so many years?

545
00:28:17,786 --> 00:28:19,477
People shouldn't be forgotten.

546
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,929
Even if they are my kind of people.

547
00:28:21,929 --> 00:28:23,836
Maybe they don't have a lot of money,

548
00:28:23,836 --> 00:28:25,941
they don't have lawyers...

549
00:28:25,941 --> 00:28:27,473
but they matter.

550
00:28:28,295 --> 00:28:29,761
They should get justice, too.

551
00:28:31,955 --> 00:28:33,038
I see.

552
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:35,693
You're a crusader.

553
00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:38,261
I guess I am.

554
00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:41,913
Good luck.

555
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,437
So, is sleep like an 
optional thing for you?

556
00:28:53,549 --> 00:28:54,920
I'm not tired.

557
00:28:56,183 --> 00:28:57,882
Guess who weighed in on your case today?

558
00:28:59,202 --> 00:29:01,061
Mmm... the commissioner.

559
00:29:05,065 --> 00:29:06,312
The commissioner?

560
00:29:07,226 --> 00:29:07,918
Apparently he

561
00:29:07,918 --> 00:29:10,808
and the Whitley's father
were college pals.

562
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:13,452
Todd called Bradley to tattle on me?

563
00:29:14,408 --> 00:29:15,463
What a baby.

564
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:16,632
And now Bradley's wondering

565
00:29:16,632 --> 00:29:18,471
when you're going back on the line.

566
00:29:18,471 --> 00:29:19,560
He couldn't pick me out of a line up.

567
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,405
Suddenly he's tracking my career?

568
00:29:21,405 --> 00:29:22,423
Screw him.

569
00:29:23,124 --> 00:29:24,824
Don't say that too 
loud in this building.

570
00:29:24,824 --> 00:29:26,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

571
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,342
Rush...

572
00:29:27,342 --> 00:29:28,534
your boyfriend's downstairs.

573
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:29,309
I'm single.

574
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,622
You sure it's not your boyfriend?

575
00:29:30,622 --> 00:29:34,653
One of the Whitleys...
booked for DUI.

576
00:29:43,523 --> 00:29:45,736
You crash that nice 
car of yours, Eric?

577
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,026
Thanks to you.

578
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:49,654
I had something to do with it?

579
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:50,812
All I did was bring up Jill.

580
00:29:50,812 --> 00:29:52,314
Why's that send you on a bender?

581
00:29:52,314 --> 00:29:55,072
My brother called our lawyer,
who called the commissioner,

582
00:29:55,471 --> 00:29:56,749
who's a very close family friend.

583
00:29:56,749 --> 00:29:58,233
I heard all about it.

584
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,427
Then why don't you take 
a hint and back off?

585
00:30:03,194 --> 00:30:04,038
'Cause something tells me

586
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:05,541
you and I are one scotch away

587
00:30:05,541 --> 00:30:07,580
from a good conversation.

588
00:30:27,746 --> 00:30:28,715
Hey, Lil.

589
00:30:28,997 --> 00:30:29,605
Hey.

590
00:30:29,605 --> 00:30:30,499
Hey.

591
00:30:30,499 --> 00:30:32,527
Las is in with Evelyn Shelby.

592
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:34,107
Huh.

593
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:42,821
I kept my own box on Jill.

594
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:43,720
It's been packed away

595
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,678
for years, but I thought 
maybe it could help.

596
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:46,461
Good.

597
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,601
Melanie told me about her 
and Todd in high school,

598
00:30:49,601 --> 00:30:51,131
behind Jill's back.

599
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:52,963
Well, she was only 15.

600
00:30:54,388 --> 00:30:54,999
Mrs. Shelby,

601
00:30:54,999 --> 00:30:57,575
it looks like we're closing
in on Eric Whitley.

602
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,073
The younger one?

603
00:30:59,073 --> 00:31:00,022
Yeah, well,

604
00:31:00,022 --> 00:31:01,836
he doesn't have an 
alibi for that night.

605
00:31:01,836 --> 00:31:03,994
And, uh, he was pretty sick

606
00:31:03,994 --> 00:31:06,144
in love with your daughter.

607
00:31:08,145 --> 00:31:09,931
I was looking at her yearbook,

608
00:31:09,931 --> 00:31:11,686
and I remembered this boy.

609
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,241
Ann Winters' son.

610
00:31:15,155 --> 00:31:18,212
A few years after Jill died 
he said something to Ann

611
00:31:18,212 --> 00:31:20,821
about the Whitleys 
getting away with murder.

612
00:31:24,157 --> 00:31:25,946
Why isn't this in the file?

613
00:31:25,946 --> 00:31:27,025
Well, it should be.

614
00:31:27,025 --> 00:31:28,827
John told it to the police.

615
00:31:28,827 --> 00:31:30,130
What's the kid name?

616
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:32,292
Charlie Winters.

617
00:31:34,512 --> 00:31:36,337
If Britt talked to him 
I'd have a  record of it.

618
00:31:36,337 --> 00:31:38,105
He was meticulous.

619
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:39,829
Well, are you sure

620
00:31:39,829 --> 00:31:41,490
your husband mentioned it to Britt?

621
00:31:42,175 --> 00:31:43,686
He told me he did.

622
00:31:47,283 --> 00:31:49,246
Could he have lied, Evelyn?

623
00:31:50,202 --> 00:31:51,195
Well, I don't know.

624
00:31:51,195 --> 00:31:53,968
I mean, I hounded him about it.

625
00:31:53,968 --> 00:31:55,356
He said it came to nothing.

626
00:31:55,356 --> 00:31:58,240
That I should stop brining it up.

627
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,664
Stop pointing fingers at the Whitleys.

628
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:02,997
They were a powerful family.

629
00:32:05,662 --> 00:32:08,968
I guess we both know what it's 
like to have a husband fail you.

630
00:32:12,863 --> 00:32:14,897
We'll find Charile Winters, Evelyn.

631
00:32:15,422 --> 00:32:16,113
We'll talk to him,

632
00:32:16,113 --> 00:32:18,496
and we'll let you know what he says.

633
00:32:45,561 --> 00:32:46,622
Thanks for coming out.

634
00:32:46,622 --> 00:32:48,634
I can't really leave the retreat.

635
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:51,217
Sure. It's about Jill Shelby.

636
00:32:51,984 --> 00:32:53,692
So, now you wanna hear?

637
00:32:54,594 --> 00:32:56,279
Yeah, you told the cops 
you didn't see anything.

638
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:57,213
Yeah, at first.

639
00:32:57,904 --> 00:32:59,862
But then I came to the Shelbys

640
00:32:59,862 --> 00:33:01,914
with some good information,

641
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,879
and I got the brush-off.

642
00:33:04,879 --> 00:33:07,047
You come stoned in your VW van?

643
00:33:07,047 --> 00:33:08,143
So?

644
00:33:08,143 --> 00:33:10,841
Charlie, Evelyn Shelby's 
the one who told us about you.

645
00:33:10,841 --> 00:33:12,900
Screw Evelyn Shelby, okay?

646
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,767
I tried to help her years ago.

647
00:33:15,977 --> 00:33:16,954
She wouldn't hear it.

648
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:19,560
You're right, Charlie,
but she's not afraid now,

649
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,073
and we wanna hear.

650
00:33:23,689 --> 00:33:24,431
Okay.

651
00:33:27,938 --> 00:33:29,407
I was, um...

652
00:33:30,636 --> 00:33:33,964
Kind of passed out on a lounge chair.

653
00:33:33,964 --> 00:33:34,645
How could this happen?

654
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:35,725
Just shut up.

655
00:33:36,623 --> 00:33:38,319
Why'd you have to wear this?

656
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:39,463
What?

657
00:33:39,463 --> 00:33:40,572
It's ruined.

658
00:33:44,567 --> 00:33:45,621
That's what you were thinking about?

659
00:33:45,621 --> 00:33:47,098
That stupid jacket?

660
00:33:47,098 --> 00:33:48,891
Just leave things to me.

661
00:33:56,822 --> 00:34:00,040
So, they... got in 
their car and left,

662
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,659
and, man, I just got 
the hell out of there.

663
00:34:04,017 --> 00:34:06,357
Why'd Eric care so 
much about the jacket?

664
00:34:08,582 --> 00:34:09,594
There was this...

665
00:34:10,377 --> 00:34:12,958
one year that Eric 
did wrestling, and...

666
00:34:14,089 --> 00:34:17,016
Todd couldn't wrestle 
to save his life.

667
00:34:20,045 --> 00:34:22,414
I think it was the only thing that...

668
00:34:23,254 --> 00:34:25,274
he could do better than Todd.

669
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:28,450
Hi.

670
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:29,296
How was it?

671
00:34:29,296 --> 00:34:29,898
Good.

672
00:34:31,712 --> 00:34:33,398
I need a couple of minutes.

673
00:34:33,898 --> 00:34:35,596
I... I have to tell you something

674
00:34:35,596 --> 00:34:36,967
that's gonna be hard to hear.

675
00:34:38,866 --> 00:34:41,272
Todd was seen with the 
murder weapon that night.

676
00:34:43,261 --> 00:34:44,821
But I was with him.

677
00:34:44,821 --> 00:34:47,003
You were asleep after 
drinking all night.

678
00:34:47,003 --> 00:34:48,775
He could've got out of bed later.

679
00:34:48,775 --> 00:34:50,592
This is the father of my children.

680
00:34:50,592 --> 00:34:52,203
He was involved with 
a murder, Melanie,

681
00:34:52,203 --> 00:34:54,324
that's someone that you 
don't know very well.

682
00:34:55,712 --> 00:34:58,326
Well, maybe he was just 
covering up for Eric.

683
00:34:58,326 --> 00:34:59,820
Even if that's all he did,

684
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,694
that's accessory to murder.

685
00:35:15,302 --> 00:35:17,300
I wanna tell you something...

686
00:35:18,394 --> 00:35:20,296
but if I do, I can't go home.

687
00:35:21,478 --> 00:35:22,841
I can help you with that.

688
00:35:23,975 --> 00:35:25,713
They're talking every night.

689
00:35:25,713 --> 00:35:26,942
They're arguing.

690
00:35:28,311 --> 00:35:31,026
Todd keeps telling Eric 
to stay away from Tabby's.

691
00:35:31,026 --> 00:35:31,823
What's that?

692
00:35:31,823 --> 00:35:33,095
They have an aunt, Tabitha.

693
00:35:33,095 --> 00:35:34,945
She has a house in Chestnut Hill.

694
00:35:34,945 --> 00:35:39,073
It was... it was close to 
where we all used to live.

695
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,729
Pack a bag for you and the kids.

696
00:35:42,547 --> 00:35:44,177
You're coming with me.

697
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,220
Hey.

698
00:35:57,007 --> 00:35:58,270
Where's my wife?

699
00:35:59,927 --> 00:36:01,062
Safe.

700
00:36:01,062 --> 00:36:02,285
Hey, bitch,

701
00:36:02,722 --> 00:36:04,852
you tell me where she is.

702
00:36:04,852 --> 00:36:07,701
Is this how you handle 
women you can't control?

703
00:36:07,701 --> 00:36:09,007
This supposed to scare me?

704
00:36:09,007 --> 00:36:10,800
It's supposed to make you think.

705
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,499
I'm not like the girls 
you're used to, Todd.

706
00:36:14,207 --> 00:36:17,241
You can't try to charm me, 
then when that doesn't work,

707
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,937
talk down to me, then 
when that doesn't work,

708
00:36:19,937 --> 00:36:21,169
get aggressive.

709
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,403
I'm not Jill

710
00:36:23,403 --> 00:36:24,618
or Melanie.

711
00:36:25,191 --> 00:36:28,369
I'm the police, and we're at the 
police headquarters, you moron.

712
00:36:31,351 --> 00:36:33,276
You gonna talk to me like that?

713
00:36:33,276 --> 00:36:34,397
What are you gonna do?

714
00:36:35,016 --> 00:36:37,021
Kill me in the parking lot of Central?

715
00:36:37,975 --> 00:36:39,772
You think you'll get away with it again?

716
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:44,870
I know about Tabby's.

717
00:36:45,404 --> 00:36:46,678
I'll have a warrant tomorrow,

718
00:36:46,678 --> 00:36:48,911
and guys are sitting on it right now.

719
00:36:48,911 --> 00:36:51,710
Whatever you hid there, 
we're about to find it.

720
00:36:54,094 --> 00:36:55,679
So it's over.

721
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:02,626
Okay.

722
00:37:15,075 --> 00:37:16,759
I can't protect him anymore.

723
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:21,906
I did as much as I could.

724
00:37:24,157 --> 00:37:26,615
Why don't you come in, 
give me a statement?

725
00:37:31,408 --> 00:37:32,363
Okay.

726
00:37:43,282 --> 00:37:44,566
Flipped on his brother.

727
00:37:46,655 --> 00:37:47,800
Do you believe him?

728
00:37:48,385 --> 00:37:49,665
I don't know.

729
00:37:49,665 --> 00:37:51,229
I gotta find Eric.

730
00:38:04,276 --> 00:38:05,802
No meeting tonight, huh?

731
00:38:06,795 --> 00:38:08,132
Screw the meetings.

732
00:38:09,334 --> 00:38:10,546
Scotch and soda.

733
00:38:11,596 --> 00:38:12,889
Look, I can't talk to you.

734
00:38:14,783 --> 00:38:17,041
My brother chewed me 
out the day you came by.

735
00:38:19,245 --> 00:38:21,987
Really? 'Cause he's been 
talking to me a lot.

736
00:38:21,987 --> 00:38:24,666
Yeah, well, I guess he puts
himself in a different category.

737
00:38:26,616 --> 00:38:28,936
He told me about you and Jill, and...

738
00:38:31,014 --> 00:38:33,068
that you were in love with her.

739
00:38:33,469 --> 00:38:35,019
She was his girlfriend.

740
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,053
Oh, she'd hang around 
with you when, uh...

741
00:38:42,635 --> 00:38:46,332
no one was around, but drop 
you the second Todd showed up.

742
00:38:46,332 --> 00:38:48,279
Look, I already told you 
that she was like that.

743
00:38:48,279 --> 00:38:50,640
And that he found you 
two together that night.

744
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,418
Look, I said I couldn't talk to you.

745
00:38:57,833 --> 00:39:00,341
What happened to your 
letter jacket, Eric?

746
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:01,671
I don't know.

747
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,047
Another.

748
00:39:04,047 --> 00:39:05,943
I don't think there's time for another.

749
00:39:07,461 --> 00:39:09,037
I have to arrest you.

750
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:12,419
He told me you did it,

751
00:39:12,419 --> 00:39:14,220
and that you came to him 
for help afterwards,

752
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,720
and you two buried the 
racket at your aunt's house.

753
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,557
Why would I kill her?

754
00:39:19,906 --> 00:39:22,236
Because she humiliated you.

755
00:39:24,038 --> 00:39:26,765
She accused you of watching them.

756
00:39:26,765 --> 00:39:28,312
Oh, my God.

757
00:39:29,314 --> 00:39:30,974
So what, he's pinning it on me now?

758
00:39:30,974 --> 00:39:32,890
It's his story against yours.

759
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:35,182
And you're the problem drunk 
who never got his life together,

760
00:39:35,182 --> 00:39:36,878
so if you have anything to give me,,

761
00:39:36,878 --> 00:39:37,732
you should do it now.

762
00:39:37,732 --> 00:39:39,962
Look, he ruined my jacket.

763
00:39:41,008 --> 00:39:43,452
He got his blood all 
over it. Hers, too.

764
00:39:49,456 --> 00:39:51,863
You didn't throw it out, did you?

765
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:00,866
And Jill didn't humiliate me.

766
00:40:04,362 --> 00:40:05,727
He did.

767
00:40:27,188 --> 00:40:28,269
Hi, gorgeous.

768
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:31,593
Where were you?

769
00:40:32,249 --> 00:40:33,929
Well, you can't really ask me that.

770
00:40:33,929 --> 00:40:35,154
That's my jacket.

771
00:40:35,154 --> 00:40:37,013
So you finally got a taste of her, huh?

772
00:40:37,013 --> 00:40:38,516
Now you have something 
real to jerk off to.

773
00:40:38,516 --> 00:40:39,436
Todd.

774
00:40:39,436 --> 00:40:42,393
Huh, have you seen him in the 
window watching us have sex?

775
00:40:43,175 --> 00:40:44,705
That's crazy.

776
00:40:44,705 --> 00:40:46,972
Up in the tree with his 
hand down his pants.

777
00:40:46,972 --> 00:40:49,002
Stop. Please.

778
00:40:49,002 --> 00:40:50,716
Well, you're the one 
who just screwed him.

779
00:40:50,716 --> 00:40:52,789
I didn't screw him. 
Give me some credit.

780
00:40:52,789 --> 00:40:54,258
I saw you all pressed up to him.

781
00:40:54,258 --> 00:40:55,971
Only 'cause you were off with Melanie.

782
00:40:55,971 --> 00:40:57,461
Just stop talking.

783
00:40:57,461 --> 00:40:58,507
Asshole.

784
00:40:58,507 --> 00:40:59,191
Bitch.

785
00:40:59,191 --> 00:40:59,960
Don't.

786
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,073
Shut up!

787
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:03,503
You're so pathetic.

788
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:05,097
And you're such a prick.

789
00:41:05,486 --> 00:41:07,210
You shut your mouth.

790
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:08,434
Screw you.

791
00:41:08,434 --> 00:41:10,130
Hey, slut...

792
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:11,820
I said shut your mouth.
