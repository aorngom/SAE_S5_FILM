3
00:00:12, 760 --> 00:00:15, 320
Been waiting for you,  baby.  
Where you at  ?

4
00:00:17, 750 --> 00:00:19, 970
When exactly you going
to be home  ?

5
00:00:20, 220 --> 00:00:21, 500
I just got a little hung up,  baby.  

6
00:00:21, 560 --> 00:00:23, 380
I'm on my way back to the city now.  

7
00:00:23, 480 --> 00:00:26, 230
I don't understand what
you been doing all this time.  

8
00:00:26, 330 --> 00:00:28, 740
Starting to worry.  
You know I hate to worry,  babe.  

9
00:00:28, 780 --> 00:00:31, 550
Oh,  no,  sweetie.   There's nothing
to worry about.  

10
00:00:31, 650 --> 00:00:33, 710
I just finished setting up
our contacts down here.  

11
00:00:33, 750 --> 00:00:36, 160
"Contacts"  ? Like what,  your family  ?

12
00:00:36, 280 --> 00:00:38, 720
No,  I just lined up that doc
who writes scrips, 

13
00:00:38, 760 --> 00:00:42, 020
as long as we kick back
and keep it all in cash.  

14
00:00:42, 860 --> 00:00:45, 280
So you're on your way
driving back now  ?

15
00:00:45, 370 --> 00:00:47, 110
Yeah,  I'll be back before sunup.  

16
00:00:47, 180 --> 00:00:51, 730
Well,  that's good,  babe,  'cause
I can't wait to see your lying ass  !

17
00:00:52, 570 --> 00:00:53, 960
No-no-no  !

18
00:00:57, 920 --> 00:01:00, 080
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to  ?

19
00:01:00, 840 --> 00:01:03, 030
Get in here  !

20
00:01:03, 120 --> 00:01:05, 290
Stop it  !

21
00:01:21, 060 --> 00:01:22, 970
Christina ?

22
00:01:31, 200 --> 00:01:33, 940
Christina ?

Someone here to see you, Will.

Yeah ?

29
00:03:08, 430 --> 00:03:10, 180
Althea Johnson.  

30
00:03:11, 770 --> 00:03:15, 430
Daughter Wanda shot and dumped
in the Badlands back in '93.  

31
00:03:15, 880 --> 00:03:17, 670
Bana bread, hmm ?

32
00:03:17, 720 --> 00:03:19, 660
17 years this November.  

33
00:03:19, 730 --> 00:03:22, 930
Calls me every year asking
if there's been a break.  

34
00:03:23, 040 --> 00:03:25, 930
Been hanging these faithfully.  

35
00:03:26, 020 --> 00:03:28, 830
Wish I could tell you we have a
break in the case,  Mrs.  Johnson, but.  .  .  

36
00:03:28, 910 --> 00:03:32, 270
I got a call on my flyer, Detective.  

37
00:03:32, 390 --> 00:03:35, 570
Man says he saw Wanda
in a car that night.  

38
00:03:35, 670 --> 00:03:36, 740
Alive.  

39
00:03:36, 780 --> 00:03:38, 580
- Night she was killed ?
- Yes.  

40
00:03:38, 640 --> 00:03:42, 080
Green car, just like the
one the other witness said.  

41
00:03:42, 150 --> 00:03:43, 270
Where ?

42
00:03:43, 350 --> 00:03:45, 280
Corner of Kip and Cambria.  

43
00:03:45, 370 --> 00:03:46, 590
That's a bad drug corner.  

44
00:03:46, 660 --> 00:03:47, 700
I know.  

45
00:03:47, 770 --> 00:03:50, 530
But my Wanda didn't mess
with drugs, Detective.  

46
00:03:50, 620 --> 00:03:52, 340
She was a good girl.  

47
00:03:53, 560 --> 00:03:55, 400
You should have done
that homework last night.  

48
00:03:55, 490 --> 00:03:57, 960
Mama, please. It's done.  

49
00:03:58, 010 --> 00:03:59, 850
And you didn't eat your breakfast.  

50
00:03:59, 910 --> 00:04:01, 680
I got a Pop-Tart.  

51
00:04:06, 150 --> 00:04:08, 010
- Wanda, honey ?
- What ?

52
00:04:08, 090 --> 00:04:09, 740
You going to run barefoot ?

53
00:04:10, 100 --> 00:04:11, 890
- You forgot your track shoes.  
- Bye.  

54
00:04:11, 960 --> 00:04:13, 860
Are you forgetting something else ?

55
00:04:13, 950 --> 00:04:16, 280
- Mom ?
- You're still my little girl.  

56
00:04:28, 190 --> 00:04:33, 350
Ten minutes late to pick her up
from practice and she was gone.  

57
00:04:33, 670 --> 00:04:36, 310
This man... he just
happened to see her ?

58
00:04:36, 380 --> 00:04:38, 200
I grilled him good.  

59
00:04:38, 260 --> 00:04:40, 270
I believe he's telling the truth.  

60
00:04:40, 320 --> 00:04:41, 680
We'll bring him in. Check his story.  

61
00:04:41, 750 --> 00:04:45, 910
Calls himself Brother Olajuwon now.  

62
00:04:46, 220 --> 00:04:48, 480
Says he turned his life around.  

63
00:04:48, 900 --> 00:04:50, 880
Oh, one of those.  

64
00:04:50, 940 --> 00:04:55, 280
I'd prefer if you keep
an open mind, Detective.  

65
00:04:56, 370 --> 00:04:58, 830
Hey, Valens. Did you hear about Mota ?

66
00:04:58, 940 --> 00:05:00, 120
What's that ?

67
00:05:00, 190 --> 00:05:03, 040
Just got Swiss-cheesed in the
shower up in the big house.  

68
00:05:04, 790 --> 00:05:07, 270
- Really ?
- You didn't know about that ?

69
00:05:08, 600 --> 00:05:10, 060
Just now hearing it.  

70
00:05:10, 160 --> 00:05:12, 230
Hmm, just asking 'cause, uh, 

71
00:05:12, 340 --> 00:05:17, 530
I saw the visitation logs and you were up there
now two days ago paying Hector Cruz a visit.  

72
00:05:17, 620 --> 00:05:20, 890
Yeah.  Yeah, it's some
other case I'm working.  

73
00:05:21, 400 --> 00:05:23, 630
Something I need to worry about ?

74
00:05:23, 950 --> 00:05:26, 160
Hmm, or anybody else for that matter ?

75
00:05:26, 650 --> 00:05:28, 220
I don't see why.  

76
00:05:29, 990 --> 00:05:32, 260
Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.  

77
00:05:33, 060 --> 00:05:34, 860
Yeah.  

78
00:05:35, 520 --> 00:05:37, 420
Thanks for the heads-up.  

79
00:05:38, 290 --> 00:05:40, 480
***

80
00:05:41, 520 --> 00:05:43, 170
Hey, buddy.  

81
00:05:43, 240 --> 00:05:45, 810
Anybody asking for a Christina
Rush last night, room 48 ?

82
00:05:45, 880 --> 00:05:50, 210
I'm sorry.  That information will require
a warrant from a judge or a magistrate.  

83
00:05:50, 540 --> 00:05:51, 440
What ?

84
00:05:51, 520 --> 00:05:54, 690
Under the Fourth Amendment
based on probable cause.  

85
00:05:54, 800 --> 00:05:57, 900
You're going to require orthodontia
you don't start answering the right way.  

86
00:05:58, 000 --> 00:06:00, 390
Christina Rush, 48.  

87
00:06:00, 570 --> 00:06:04, 220
I'm sorry. There's no one that's checked
in or out this week by that name.  

88
00:06:04, 320 --> 00:06:06, 980
You open up or I'm going to put that
fire extinguisher through this window.  

89
00:06:07, 030 --> 00:06:09, 480
Well, that wouldn't seem prudent.  

90
00:06:13, 140 --> 00:06:16, 000
Do I need to call the police ?

91
00:06:16, 830 --> 00:06:18, 890
Better yet, how about I call Vice ?

92
00:06:18, 980 --> 00:06:21, 970
Shut down this fleabag for
narcotics and prostitution.  

93
00:06:30, 350 --> 00:06:32, 250
Who paid the bill ?

94
00:06:32, 460 --> 00:06:34, 260
They haven't checked out yet.  

95
00:06:36, 320 --> 00:06:38, 620
Bernie, que paso ?

96
00:06:38, 700 --> 00:06:39, 780
What ?

97
00:06:42, 900 --> 00:06:44, 890
are you kidding me ?

98
00:06:45, 440 --> 00:06:47, 340
"Alexis Childress" ?

99
00:06:47, 790 --> 00:06:50, 740
I was just informed by housekeeping
that the room is trashed.  

100
00:06:50, 810 --> 00:06:52, 480
The woman in 48, what did she look like ?

101
00:06:52, 560 --> 00:06:55, 050
Sandy blonde, in her 30s.  

102
00:06:55, 120 --> 00:06:56, 790
Looks a little like you.  

103
00:06:56, 900 --> 00:06:58, 390
You take a credit card for the deposit ?

104
00:06:58, 450 --> 00:07:01, 340
I waived it on account
of her general hotness.  

105
00:07:01, 710 --> 00:07:03, 040
That, and she paid cash.  

106
00:07:03, 100 --> 00:07:04, 710
Anyone else coming or
going from this room ?

107
00:07:04, 770 --> 00:07:07, 430
Just you, and now the room is trashed.  

108
00:07:09, 820 --> 00:07:12, 420
Hey, who's going to pay for this ? !

109
00:07:15, 100 --> 00:07:18, 480
Don't see that witness statement
about the car back in '93.  

110
00:07:18, 560 --> 00:07:20, 290
Could have swore it was here.  

111
00:07:20, 360 --> 00:07:24, 860
Inez Kellog, little old lady got a partial
on a green SUV leaving the dump site.  

112
00:07:24, 930 --> 00:07:26, 840
Anybody else been in the box ?

113
00:07:27, 740 --> 00:07:29, 060
Not according to the log.  

114
00:07:29, 130 --> 00:07:30, 090
But you remember it ?

115
00:07:30, 150 --> 00:07:34, 400
Yeah.  Never went anywhere 'cause
she couldn't I.D. the model or year.  

116
00:07:35, 230 --> 00:07:38, 570
Oh... New info puts Wanda in a
similar car three blocks from there.  

117
00:07:39, 400 --> 00:07:42, 440
This guy better not
be sowing false hope.  

118
00:07:43, 150 --> 00:07:44, 610
Hey, you all right ?

119
00:07:44, 690 --> 00:07:46, 190
Yeah, I'm fine.  

120
00:07:46, 260 --> 00:07:47, 670
But Christina's gone.  

121
00:07:47, 750 --> 00:07:49, 600
Along with my service weapon.  

122
00:07:49, 780 --> 00:07:51, 690
Lil, you've got to call this in.  

123
00:07:51, 750 --> 00:07:53, 190
I need your help getting them both back.  

124
00:07:53, 240 --> 00:07:56, 090
But you don't report it stolen, it gets
used in a crime, that's it, Lil. You're done.  

125
00:07:56, 120 --> 00:07:58, 450
Look, I know what this means, Scotty.  

126
00:07:58, 570 --> 00:08:00, 710
I'm asking for your help.  

127
00:08:01, 940 --> 00:08:03, 610
What do we got ?

128
00:08:03, 690 --> 00:08:06, 660
Well, the guy tossed the room.
He was looking for something.  

129
00:08:08, 460 --> 00:08:10, 650
Oxys. Who's "Alexis Childress" ?

130
00:08:10, 730 --> 00:08:12, 790
The same name the room's under.  

131
00:08:12, 870 --> 00:08:14, 310
It's all we got to go on.  

132
00:08:14, 370 --> 00:08:17, 000
But you want to go after
these guys without a gun ?

133
00:08:17, 140 --> 00:08:18, 640
Don't worry.  

134
00:08:18, 720 --> 00:08:20, 540
I got a gun.  

135
00:08:25, 640 --> 00:08:27, 620
Robert Miggs ?

136
00:08:27, 730 --> 00:08:30, 020
As-salaam alaikum, Detective.  

137
00:08:30, 100 --> 00:08:32, 280
And it's Brother Olajuwon now.  

138
00:08:32, 380 --> 00:08:35, 580
Yeah. Only reason we're meeting like
this is 'cause of Althea Johnson.  

139
00:08:35, 660 --> 00:08:37, 120
She said I could trust you.  

140
00:08:37, 160 --> 00:08:41, 240
You find the prophet while doing
that dime up at Camp Hill, brother ?

141
00:08:41, 320 --> 00:08:43, 320
Allah had a plan for me.  

142
00:08:43, 370 --> 00:08:46, 100
That plan include
sprouting a conscience ?

143
00:08:46, 270 --> 00:08:49, 600
The first thing I saw when I
finished my incarceration was

144
00:08:49, 650 --> 00:08:52, 560
that woman out there in
a blizzard hanging flyers.  

145
00:08:52, 630 --> 00:08:54, 780
She wanted to find out what
happened to her daughter.  

146
00:08:54, 840 --> 00:08:59, 380
Yeah.  Well, I saw that girl's
face, and I remembered...

147
00:08:59, 480 --> 00:09:01, 670
Name's Wanda. Where'd you see her ?

148
00:09:01, 740 --> 00:09:04, 610
Like Brother Malcolm, I, too,
was in the game.  

149
00:09:04, 670 --> 00:09:05, 700
Dealing.  

150
00:09:05, 760 --> 00:09:10, 630
The corner was "poppin'" as
they say in the pusher parlance.  

151
00:09:11, 070 --> 00:09:13, 370
Wanda trying to cop ?

152
00:09:13, 430 --> 00:09:15, 630
I don't know what she
was doing in that car.  

153
00:09:15, 670 --> 00:09:17, 380
Just knew something wasn't right.  

154
00:09:38, 080 --> 00:09:40, 340
Yo, check off, Young.  

155
00:09:41, 580 --> 00:09:43, 590
I don't like that one.  

156
00:09:45, 030 --> 00:09:47, 240
Something ain't right with that.  

157
00:09:52, 710 --> 00:09:55, 380
Can't get that girl's
face out of my thoughts.  

158
00:09:55, 440 --> 00:09:57, 390
You get a good look at the car ?

159
00:09:57, 470 --> 00:09:59, 460
Green Ford Explorer.  

160
00:09:59, 560 --> 00:10:00, 870
Got a head for cars ?

161
00:10:00, 950 --> 00:10:02, 890
Skill set you get on the corner.  

162
00:10:02, 960 --> 00:10:04, 720
Only way to read your customer.  

163
00:10:04, 790 --> 00:10:06, 120
What'd that car say to you ?

164
00:10:06, 190 --> 00:10:09, 640
Caucasian car-- that's
how come I rembered.  

165
00:10:09, 760 --> 00:10:13, 720
Wondered what a beautiful, young
sister was doing in a ride like that.  

166
00:10:13, 790 --> 00:10:15, 720
You see anybody in there with her ?

167
00:10:15, 830 --> 00:10:18, 570
No.  Just heard voices.  

168
00:10:18, 630 --> 00:10:23, 100
Some kind of dispute, then
the gun went off.  

169
00:10:25, 240 --> 00:10:28, 600
Different model years of Ford Explorers.  

170
00:10:29, 540 --> 00:10:32, 320
Tell me which one you recognize.  

171
00:10:33, 280 --> 00:10:35, 200
Like that.  

172
00:10:35, 350 --> 00:10:37, 660
'92 Ford Explorer.  

173
00:10:37, 740 --> 00:10:39, 450
Sure ?

174
00:10:39, 530 --> 00:10:42, 540
Had one of them DARE stickers on it.  

175
00:10:50, 590 --> 00:10:52, 780
Where'd you get that ?

176
00:10:53, 550 --> 00:10:55, 550
It was a gift.  

177
00:10:55, 670 --> 00:10:57, 410
You prepared to use that thing ?

178
00:10:57, 500 --> 00:10:58, 850
They got my sister.  

179
00:10:58, 910 --> 00:11:01, 780
Assaulted me and took my gun.  

180
00:11:01, 880 --> 00:11:04, 100
Just evening the odds.  

181
00:11:04, 340 --> 00:11:09, 240
Start with this Rothman Drugs doling
out a lifetime supply of painkillers, huh ?

182
00:11:09, 650 --> 00:11:13, 240
100 count, 160 milligrams.  

183
00:11:13, 290 --> 00:11:16, 220
That's a lot of blues.
Worse than I thought.  

184
00:11:17, 030 --> 00:11:18, 950
What's that mean ?

185
00:11:20, 370 --> 00:11:22, 530
Come on, Lil. You saw her.  

186
00:11:22, 640 --> 00:11:27, 520
It's what pill-poppers do:
use fake names to get scrips.  

187
00:11:27, 600 --> 00:11:29, 420
Why you so sure that
they're Christina's ?

188
00:11:29, 480 --> 00:11:32, 340
Checked into that fleabag
under the same alias.  

189
00:11:32, 410 --> 00:11:36, 140
He's gotta use a fake name 'cause she can't get
a scrip for a controlled substance with a record.  

190
00:11:36, 190 --> 00:11:39, 070
You know, my sister's a lot
of things, but a drug addict ?

191
00:11:41, 040 --> 00:11:42, 680
You know something I don't, Scotty ?

192
00:11:42, 730 --> 00:11:43, 890
Here we go.  

193
00:11:43, 960 --> 00:11:46, 100
When's the last time you saw her ?

194
00:11:46, 150 --> 00:11:47, 270
When was that ?

195
00:11:47, 310 --> 00:11:51, 230
She called me... a couple days ago...  

196
00:11:51, 430 --> 00:11:52, 760
("Beast of Burden" by The
Rolling Stones playing)

197
00:11:52, 820 --> 00:11:55, 430
Just tell her I'll be
back soon, okay, baby ?

198
00:11:57, 250 --> 00:11:59, 730
All right, take care.  

199
00:12:05, 420 --> 00:12:07, 590
Thanks for coming.  

200
00:12:09, 910 --> 00:12:15, 270
Listen, I know I left a mess
last time I was in town.  

201
00:12:17, 740 --> 00:12:20, 000
I'm really sorry about that.  

202
00:12:22, 820 --> 00:12:25, 570
What do you need, Christina ?

203
00:12:26, 810 --> 00:12:30, 180
- So it's like that, huh ?
- Yeah, it's like that.  

204
00:12:30, 260 --> 00:12:32, 150
Just get to it.  

205
00:12:36, 550 --> 00:12:39, 860
You're the only one who
really knows my sister;

206
00:12:40, 240 --> 00:12:41, 890
what she's like, what she's thinking.  

207
00:12:41, 980 --> 00:12:43, 150
I don't know about that.  

208
00:12:43, 240 --> 00:12:45, 750
I wanna know if she still hates me.  

209
00:12:47, 830 --> 00:12:49, 920
You're talking to me.  

210
00:12:50, 020 --> 00:12:52, 620
You haven't even spoken
to her yet, have you ?

211
00:12:56, 980 --> 00:13:00, 840
Do you think there's a chance
that Lilly could ever get past it ?

212
00:13:00, 980 --> 00:13:03, 740
What difference does it make ?
You're just gonna skip town.  

213
00:13:03, 780 --> 00:13:06, 480
No, no. That's just it.  

214
00:13:06, 980 --> 00:13:09, 530
I want to move back.  

215
00:13:09, 600 --> 00:13:12, 360
This is my home. This is
where my family is.  

216
00:13:13, 920 --> 00:13:15, 840
I don't know, Christina.  

217
00:13:17, 610 --> 00:13:20, 610
You're gonna have to
call Lilly yourself.  

218
00:13:20, 970 --> 00:13:26, 070
But you might wanna
get cleaned up first.  

219
00:13:27, 750 --> 00:13:30, 210
I'm trying, Scotty.  

220
00:13:31, 580 --> 00:13:32, 950
I'm really trying.  

221
00:13:33, 050 --> 00:13:35, 160
I know that look from Narcotics.  

222
00:13:35, 220 --> 00:13:39, 660
It wasn't pinned...  
but she was jonesing.  

223
00:13:41, 180 --> 00:13:45, 830
My sister...   hooked on hillbilly
heroin, and you didn't tell me ?

224
00:13:46, 470 --> 00:13:49, 080
What the hell was I supposed to say, Lil ?
After what happened last time ?

225
00:13:50, 520 --> 00:13:51, 700
Hey, wait, wait, wait.  

226
00:13:51, 830 --> 00:13:54, 530
What are you doing ?

227
00:13:55, 510 --> 00:13:56, 750
You lied to my face !

228
00:13:56, 810 --> 00:13:58, 690
- What ?
- See ? I knew you would react this way.  

229
00:13:58, 730 --> 00:14:00, 200
Why you think she came to me first, Lil ?

230
00:14:00, 260 --> 00:14:01, 960
Of course, why wouldn't she ?

231
00:14:02, 020 --> 00:14:04, 270
It says a lot about your
relationship, don't it ?

232
00:14:04, 340 --> 00:14:06, 480
You think I wanna get put in the
middle of this all over again ?

233
00:14:06, 550 --> 00:14:07, 720
It didn't stop you before.  

234
00:14:07, 780 --> 00:14:10, 130
Just another piece to you right, Scotty ?

235
00:14:11, 200 --> 00:14:14, 640
You know, why don't ya take your ass back
up to the feds and take that big job ?

236
00:14:14, 690 --> 00:14:17, 790
You can forget about us just
like you forgot about your sister.  

237
00:14:17, 890 --> 00:14:19, 890
What ?!

238
00:14:21, 080 --> 00:14:24, 130
I figured you were her
next stop anyway.  

239
00:14:24, 190 --> 00:14:26, 330
Was I right ?

240
00:14:28, 610 --> 00:14:31, 030
Why wouldn't you just tell me ?

241
00:14:31, 840 --> 00:14:34, 010
I don't know, Lil.  

242
00:14:34, 100 --> 00:14:36, 990
Maybe I got my own family to deal with.  

243
00:14:37, 060 --> 00:14:39, 310
Did you ever think of that ?

244
00:14:46, 800 --> 00:14:49, 700
We just gonna stand here
arguing all damn day...  

245
00:14:50, 100 --> 00:14:53, 310
or are we gonna go get
your gun and Christina back ?

246
00:15:01, 720 --> 00:15:03, 350
Anybody seen Rush today ?

247
00:15:03, 440 --> 00:15:05, 570
Some family thing with her sister.
Think Scotty went to help her out.  

248
00:15:05, 620 --> 00:15:07, 460
I don't even want to know.  

249
00:15:07, 560 --> 00:15:09, 450
That missing witness statement turn up ?

250
00:15:09, 610 --> 00:15:10, 570
Gone.  

251
00:15:10, 640 --> 00:15:13, 290
Any luck with the partial
plates ran back in the day ?

252
00:15:13, 360 --> 00:15:17, 320
I got 40 '92 green Ford Explorers,
but none of 'em checked out.  

253
00:15:17, 370 --> 00:15:21, 120
"Wreck, alibi, in for repair,
out of search radius."  

254
00:15:21, 170 --> 00:15:22, 750
What about this one ?

255
00:15:22, 830 --> 00:15:25, 770
Every other one has a reason
why it was deleted.  

256
00:15:25, 850 --> 00:15:27, 550
Did you farm out any
legwork back in the day ?

257
00:15:27, 620 --> 00:15:32, 100
I was busy chasing down witnesses,
so I used Joe Mueller in patrol.  

258
00:15:34, 550 --> 00:15:36, 080
This is fault of patient.  

259
00:15:36, 160 --> 00:15:39, 020
People change numbers,
fax in forge scrips.  

260
00:15:39, 090 --> 00:15:40, 770
Addicts stop at nothing to get pills.  

261
00:15:40, 810 --> 00:15:43, 190
Ten refills and you don't
even double-check with the doc ?

262
00:15:43, 300 --> 00:15:44, 450
She didn't look like an addict.  

263
00:15:44, 520 --> 00:15:46, 700
Was she alone or was
she working with someone ?

264
00:15:46, 800 --> 00:15:50, 000
- What do you mean ?
- It's a lax pharmacy that doles out pills like candy.  

265
00:15:50, 030 --> 00:15:51, 750
- Word spreads fast.  
- Lies !

266
00:15:51, 820 --> 00:15:54, 400
You pulled the records.  She
was paying cash, right ?

267
00:15:54, 520 --> 00:15:56, 010
You dealing painkillers or drug addicts ?

268
00:15:56, 070 --> 00:15:59, 040
I call the DEA, that's fed time, Nazir.  

269
00:15:59, 630 --> 00:16:02, 600
Look, we're not
interested in busting you.  

270
00:16:03, 900 --> 00:16:08, 230
We're looking for this woman and
anyone else she was working with.  

271
00:16:11, 550 --> 00:16:13, 290
She came alone.  

272
00:16:13, 400 --> 00:16:16, 730
But she had the same address on her
I.D. as the two other guys from New York.  

273
00:16:16, 800 --> 00:16:18, 840
Same address ? What other guys ?

274
00:16:18, 910 --> 00:16:21, 530
New York I.D. They paid with cash.  

275
00:16:24, 480 --> 00:16:26, 340
How often these guys come in ?

276
00:16:26, 470 --> 00:16:29, 700
First guy's been in here before.  Knows
not to come more than once a week.  

277
00:16:29, 920 --> 00:16:31, 790
Well, what about this other guy ?

278
00:16:31, 890 --> 00:16:35, 390
Don't recognize him, but this is
not the only place that takes cash.  

279
00:16:36, 650 --> 00:16:39, 940
- All using fake New York I.  D.  s.  
- And you don't report it.  

280
00:16:40, 020 --> 00:16:42, 000
I'm cooperating with you now.  

281
00:16:42, 070 --> 00:16:44, 260
Pharmacies that play
ball with drug addicts.  

282
00:16:44, 320 --> 00:16:46, 230
Just one stop on the circuit ?

283
00:16:46, 290 --> 00:16:48, 260
Like clockwork.  

284
00:16:48, 340 --> 00:16:51, 430
And I can tell you the place
they're going to hit up next.  

285
00:16:54, 530 --> 00:16:55, 620
Got a minute, Joe ?

286
00:16:55, 720 --> 00:16:57, 060
Yeah.  

287
00:16:57, 150 --> 00:17:00, 750
Signed Ryan Howard bat-- wife beat her
husband to death with it last night.  

288
00:17:00, 820 --> 00:17:02, 560
Well, maybe the Phillies will sign her.  

289
00:17:02, 650 --> 00:17:04, 520
Yeah, maybe.  

290
00:17:04, 600 --> 00:17:08, 130
- What's up ?
- Been going over the Wanda Johnson case.  

291
00:17:09, 460 --> 00:17:10, 710
Drawing a blank.  

292
00:17:10, 810 --> 00:17:13, 720
15-year-old girl killed in
the Badlands back in '93.  

293
00:17:13, 780 --> 00:17:16, 670
Had you run some partial plates
from an eyewitness statement.  

294
00:17:16, 760 --> 00:17:19, 510
- You say so.  
- We got a better description of the car.  

295
00:17:19, 570 --> 00:17:22, 300
Turns out we were looking
for a '92 Ford Explorer.  

296
00:17:22, 370 --> 00:17:24, 770
- Came up zilch.  
- Yeah, we see that.  

297
00:17:25, 070 --> 00:17:27, 040
Why'd you cross this one out ?

298
00:17:27, 240 --> 00:17:29, 120
That was a long time ago.  

299
00:17:30, 000 --> 00:17:32, 400
If I had to guess, I'd say it
was a wrong plate or something.  

300
00:17:32, 480 --> 00:17:34, 810
Well, you listed a reason
for all the others.  

301
00:17:34, 880 --> 00:17:36, 800
That one.  .  .   nothing.  

302
00:17:36, 870 --> 00:17:40, 520
I'll have to, uh, consult my
field notes, jog my memory.  

303
00:17:40, 590 --> 00:17:43, 450
Like to see those notes, you don't mind.  

304
00:17:44, 010 --> 00:17:46, 680
Yeah.  I'll get right on that.  

305
00:17:51, 700 --> 00:17:53, 930
Covering up for sloppy work ?

306
00:17:54, 130 --> 00:17:56, 400
Let's hope that's all it is.  

307
00:18:03, 600 --> 00:18:07, 200
Before you even any odds
with that street gun.  .  .  

308
00:18:08, 930 --> 00:18:11, 180
This thing's still packing a charge.  

309
00:18:18, 220 --> 00:18:20, 760
I can't believe she's
hooked on painkillers.  

310
00:18:22, 520 --> 00:18:26, 070
Probably after some
injury.  That's how it starts.  

311
00:18:26, 150 --> 00:18:29, 140
I mean, all the crap we
went through with my mom.  

312
00:18:29, 560 --> 00:18:31, 360
Growing up.  

313
00:18:31, 780 --> 00:18:34, 340
You know, people think
they can just kick it.  

314
00:18:34, 530 --> 00:18:36, 910
It ain't that easy.  

315
00:18:37, 590 --> 00:18:41, 380
These pills, going straight from
that pharmacy to the street.  

316
00:18:41, 450 --> 00:18:46, 970
They grind up the time-release
Oxys to smoke, snort, shoot, whatever.  

317
00:18:47, 640 --> 00:18:49, 620
Docs give 'em to anybody.  

318
00:18:49, 740 --> 00:18:51, 450
Pharmacists are.  .  .  

319
00:19:05, 560 --> 00:19:07, 420
I found this in the room.  

320
00:19:09, 100 --> 00:19:10, 940
She tried to show it to me.  

321
00:19:11, 000 --> 00:19:13, 400
Said she rembered that swimsuit.  

322
00:19:13, 490 --> 00:19:17, 700
But she was only like.  .  .   five.  

323
00:19:17, 760 --> 00:19:20, 030
I got photos of me that age.  

324
00:19:20, 100 --> 00:19:23, 550
Makes you think you
remember being there.  

325
00:19:34, 860 --> 00:19:36, 550
That him ?

326
00:20:36, 860 --> 00:20:39, 480
***

327
00:21:00, 950 --> 00:21:03, 220
****

328
00:21:42, 370 --> 00:21:44, 020
***

329
00:21:45, 200 --> 00:21:47, 510
Hey, I'm, uh, just knocking off
to grab those files for you.  

330
00:21:47, 630 --> 00:21:49, 570
Don't bother !

331
00:21:50, 220 --> 00:21:51, 260
Get your hands off me !

332
00:21:51, 320 --> 00:21:54, 790
I'm giving you one chance to
explain how come you buried this.  

333
00:21:55, 150 --> 00:21:56, 160
It was a fluke.  

334
00:21:56, 210 --> 00:21:58, 210
Doherty had nothing to do
with that girl getting killed.  

335
00:21:58, 270 --> 00:21:59, 660
Then why did you delete the file ?

336
00:21:59, 720 --> 00:22:00, 880
He was my lieutenant.  

337
00:22:00, 940 --> 00:22:03, 340
That puts him off-limits ?

338
00:22:03, 530 --> 00:22:05, 350
Look, I gave him a heads-up.  

339
00:22:05, 450 --> 00:22:07, 820
We had a good laugh
about it, and that was it.  

340
00:22:07, 880 --> 00:22:09, 460
He ask you to bury the report ?

341
00:22:09, 510 --> 00:22:12, 970
No.  I figured the last thing my lieutenant need
was his name popping up in a hot investigation.  

342
00:22:13, 010 --> 00:22:15, 440
Well, it popped.  

343
00:22:15, 660 --> 00:22:17, 640
Look, I got respect for chain of command.  

344
00:22:17, 710 --> 00:22:18, 880
So do I, Joe.  

345
00:22:18, 960 --> 00:22:21, 100
Except when it comes
to covering up a crime.  

346
00:22:21, 160 --> 00:22:24, 130
There wasn't no cover-up.  

347
00:22:24, 810 --> 00:22:29, 840
Breathe a word of this to anybody, I'll have
you pushing a sector car around the 12th.  

348
00:22:29, 900 --> 00:22:31, 920
Yeah, we'll see about that.  

349
00:22:37, 850 --> 00:22:39, 490
Where is she, numbnuts ?

350
00:22:39, 730 --> 00:22:43, 760
You scream when I take that sock
out, I'll make you eat this whole bottle.  

351
00:22:45, 180 --> 00:22:46, 670
The hell ?

352
00:22:46, 730 --> 00:22:47, 790
What'd I do ?

353
00:22:47, 850 --> 00:22:50, 130
Where is Christina ?

354
00:22:50, 190 --> 00:22:51, 850
How the hell should I know ?

355
00:22:51, 920 --> 00:22:53, 070
That's Cliff's old lady.  

356
00:22:53, 130 --> 00:22:54, 500
Who the hell's Cliff, and where is he ?

357
00:22:54, 550 --> 00:22:56, 210
Back in Jersey.  I don't know.  

358
00:22:56, 280 --> 00:22:58, 220
I hooked him up once
to move some blues--

359
00:22:58, 260 --> 00:23:00, 870
easy stuff from pain clinics in Florida.  

360
00:23:00, 940 --> 00:23:02, 430
Run them up I-95 to Newark.  

361
00:23:02, 460 --> 00:23:03, 980
So, why is Cliff coming down here ?

362
00:23:04, 030 --> 00:23:06, 690
'Cause he sent his woman
down here to buy some pills, 

363
00:23:06, 750 --> 00:23:09, 210
and she kept lying to him, saying
she couldn't get a hold of me.  

364
00:23:09, 250 --> 00:23:10, 190
Why would she lie to him ?

365
00:23:10, 230 --> 00:23:11, 900
She said she was working
on another hookup.  

366
00:23:11, 940 --> 00:23:14, 630
One week turned to
two, Cliff started losing it.  

367
00:23:14, 680 --> 00:23:16, 130
He said he was going to have her ass.  

368
00:23:16, 180 --> 00:23:17, 390
And you knew where she was staying ?

369
00:23:17, 430 --> 00:23:20, 260
I saw her outside a rehab clinic, and
I followed her to the Grand.  

370
00:23:20, 300 --> 00:23:21, 720
And you told him where she was.  

371
00:23:21, 770 --> 00:23:24, 870
Cliff-- he's got a
possessive mean streak.  

372
00:23:24, 930 --> 00:23:26, 490
Unhinged-like.  

373
00:23:26, 530 --> 00:23:28, 960
He gave her the pimp hand and
hauled her ass out of there.  

374
00:23:29, 020 --> 00:23:30, 030
And you went there with him.  

375
00:23:30, 100 --> 00:23:33, 360
No.  He just told me to go
back and find the stash.  

376
00:23:33, 400 --> 00:23:34, 850
I found you instead.  

377
00:23:34, 930 --> 00:23:37, 260
You took my gun.  Where's my sister ?

378
00:23:37, 390 --> 00:23:39, 320
Your sister ?What ?

379
00:23:39, 370 --> 00:23:41, 580
No, man, that was Cliff.  He
took the gun, too.  

380
00:23:41, 630 --> 00:23:43, 190
You said he was in Jersey.  

381
00:23:43, 250 --> 00:23:45, 190
- Where ?
- I don't know.  

382
00:23:45, 260 --> 00:23:47, 390
Jersey City-- I
never been up there.  

383
00:23:47, 470 --> 00:23:49, 620
I don't even know the dude's last name.  

384
00:23:49, 690 --> 00:23:51, 600
Come on, man.  All I got's a cell number.  

385
00:23:51, 670 --> 00:23:54, 500
Check my phone.  It's a Jersey area code.  

386
00:23:54, 570 --> 00:23:57, 070
We'll be back.  Better be right.  

387
00:23:57, 140 --> 00:23:58, 770
Try to make it last.  

388
00:24:01, 660 --> 00:24:03, 940
What ?No dip ?

389
00:24:03, 990 --> 00:24:07, 710
That deleted plate match came
back belonging to Doherty.  

390
00:24:07, 780 --> 00:24:10, 000
Could be one of those
grassy knoll coincidences.  

391
00:24:10, 060 --> 00:24:13, 580
Be inclined to go there with you, Nick, except
I also got a missing witness statement.  

392
00:24:13, 650 --> 00:24:15, 630
Nobody's been in that box except you.  

393
00:24:15, 700 --> 00:24:18, 510
Well, that's where Nightstick
Joe comes into the picture.  

394
00:24:18, 590 --> 00:24:19, 760
Let me guess.  

395
00:24:19, 820 --> 00:24:22, 000
He deleted the license plate
that came back to Doherty.  

396
00:24:22, 070 --> 00:24:23, 820
Yeah.  See where I'm going with this ?

397
00:24:23, 920 --> 00:24:27, 070
He's trying to get in with the
bosses, so he buries the report.  

398
00:24:27, 150 --> 00:24:29, 180
Worse-- he shows
it to Doherty.  

399
00:24:29, 260 --> 00:24:31, 910
And Doherty says he'll take care of it.  

400
00:24:32, 330 --> 00:24:36, 250
I owe it to Wanda Johnson to
follow this thing to the end.  

401
00:24:36, 310 --> 00:24:38, 440
Yeah, you're going to follow it
right into forced retirement.  

402
00:24:38, 490 --> 00:24:40, 850
So mote it be.  

403
00:24:40, 920 --> 00:24:45, 920
u got anything else linking Doherty to this
except his car and a missing witness statement ?

404
00:24:46, 400 --> 00:24:47, 910
How about a gun ?

405
00:24:47, 960 --> 00:24:50, 140
Wanda was shot with a .  38.  

406
00:24:50, 200 --> 00:24:54, 910
Doherty never turned in his department-issue
.  38 when we got the new Glocks.  

407
00:24:54, 980 --> 00:24:57, 240
Looks just like this
old wheel gun of mine.  

408
00:24:58, 760 --> 00:25:02, 560
You think a police lieutenant
killed a 15-year-old girl ?

409
00:25:02, 610 --> 00:25:04, 770
There's one way to find out.  

410
00:25:04, 910 --> 00:25:07, 330
Suppose you know where
Doherty keeps his gun.  

411
00:25:07, 390 --> 00:25:10, 340
Desk, top right drawer, next
to the bottle of Old Spice.  

412
00:25:10, 390 --> 00:25:12, 210
Just walk in there and get that gun ?

413
00:25:12, 260 --> 00:25:15, 640
Doherty's got his local
clergy meeting tonight.  

414
00:25:16, 250 --> 00:25:17, 890
But after that.  .  .  

415
00:25:18, 020 --> 00:25:21, 740
("Undercover of the Night"
by the Rolling Stones plays)

416
00:25:35, 230 --> 00:25:38, 160
The sink's clogged in
the ladies' room, Sal.  

417
00:25:38, 210 --> 00:25:41, 610
I'll get to it after I finish
touching up the big boss's office.  

418
00:25:41, 690 --> 00:25:43, 250
You been hitting the gym ?

419
00:25:43, 300 --> 00:25:45, 020
Just pushing this mop and bucket.  

420
00:25:46, 190 --> 00:25:47, 950
You're looking toned.  

421
00:25:48, 050 --> 00:25:50, 220
What did you say was
wrong with the sink ?

422
00:26:01, 000 --> 00:26:04, 400
Accusing the deputy commissioner of
murder, Will, I mean, that's career suicide.  

423
00:26:04, 460 --> 00:26:08, 250
16 years I've been chewing on this case.  

424
00:26:08, 510 --> 00:26:13, 300
Dreading the baked goods she sends every year letting
me know her daughter's killer is still out there.  

425
00:26:34, 130 --> 00:26:38, 350
You better get your ducks lined up, Will, before
you go slinging accusations at the brass.  

426
00:26:38, 420 --> 00:26:40, 380
In the process of doing just that.  

427
00:26:40, 430 --> 00:26:44, 180
- What are you up to, Will ?
- Suppose Doherty's gun were to turn up.  

428
00:26:44, 270 --> 00:26:46, 710
Could you get preliminary
ballistics on it from FIU ?

429
00:26:46, 760 --> 00:26:50, 430
We better be talking hypothetical here
because I am all out of favors upstairs.  

430
00:26:52, 600 --> 00:26:55, 360
One deputy commissioner's gun.  

431
00:27:07, 330 --> 00:27:13, 570
Subscriber info on the cell comes back
to Clifton Harper in Jersey City Heights.  

432
00:27:14, 480 --> 00:27:17, 430
She's got this deranged
boyfriend after her.  

433
00:27:17, 660 --> 00:27:19, 020
She really knows how to pick them.  

434
00:27:19, 100 --> 00:27:20, 590
Easy.  

435
00:27:20, 670 --> 00:27:22, 580
I don't know why I should care anymore.  

436
00:27:22, 660 --> 00:27:23, 730
Still blood.  

437
00:27:23, 790 --> 00:27:26, 220
Still.  .  .   hurts.  

438
00:27:27, 470 --> 00:27:31, 160
Look, I'm sorry I dragged
you into this mess.  

439
00:27:33, 850 --> 00:27:37, 850
Nah.  I should have told you before.  

440
00:27:42, 150 --> 00:27:45, 810
I mean, I-I feel like I'm
still responsible for her.  

441
00:27:46, 470 --> 00:27:51, 010
I-I don't know how
to.  .  .   keep doing this.  

442
00:27:52, 180 --> 00:27:54, 930
She went through what you did, too.  

443
00:27:55, 980 --> 00:27:58, 260
Well, you would think it
would have brought us closer, 

444
00:27:58, 330 --> 00:28:01, 490
but I barely rember a
time when we got along.  

445
00:28:01, 850 --> 00:28:05, 450
When we were just.  .  .   sisters.  

446
00:28:14, 370 --> 00:28:15, 650
Don't worry.  

447
00:28:15, 760 --> 00:28:17, 500
We'll build it again.  

448
00:28:19, 400 --> 00:28:21, 770
One weekend, my dad came back.  

449
00:28:21, 860 --> 00:28:25, 850
He, uh, took us to the beach.  

450
00:28:26, 360 --> 00:28:29, 170
Christina was so happy.  

451
00:28:29, 740 --> 00:28:31, 430
But I knew.  

452
00:28:31, 480 --> 00:28:32, 560
You knew what ?

453
00:28:32, 640 --> 00:28:35, 660
He was just gonna leave again.  

454
00:28:36, 130 --> 00:28:38, 180
And he did.  

455
00:28:40, 040 --> 00:28:44, 740
Look, whatever happens, Scotty.  .  .   thanks.  

456
00:28:52, 980 --> 00:28:54, 910
You pulled me out of a
mayoral fund-raiser, John.  

457
00:28:54, 990 --> 00:28:56, 190
This better be good.  

458
00:28:56, 310 --> 00:28:57, 670
Got a few questions, Pat.  

459
00:28:57, 720 --> 00:29:00, 380
You got questions, you come up to the
fifth floor and ask 'em in the morning.  

460
00:29:00, 460 --> 00:29:02, 880
I don't think you want that.  

461
00:29:03, 010 --> 00:29:04, 540
Careful, Detective.  

462
00:29:04, 630 --> 00:29:06, 920
Wanda Johnson.  

463
00:29:08, 720 --> 00:29:10, 060
That supposed to mean something ?

464
00:29:10, 140 --> 00:29:11, 470
Well, we got a break in the case.  

465
00:29:11, 560 --> 00:29:12, 880
Great.  Work it.  

466
00:29:15, 830 --> 00:29:17, 460
Is this some kind of stunt ?

467
00:29:17, 540 --> 00:29:21, 720
Wanda Johnson was shot and killed
in the Badlands back in '93.  

468
00:29:21, 790 --> 00:29:24, 320
Witness came forward, puts
Wanda in your car.  

469
00:29:24, 390 --> 00:29:26, 850
Green '92 Ford Explorer.  

470
00:29:26, 930 --> 00:29:28, 700
Sounds like you have
an unreliable witness.  

471
00:29:28, 770 --> 00:29:32, 000
Oh, your car popped back in
the day off a partial plate.  

472
00:29:32, 060 --> 00:29:34, 060
Got deleted from the file.  

473
00:29:34, 140 --> 00:29:37, 720
Okay.  I see where this is going.  

474
00:29:37, 800 --> 00:29:39, 380
And I'll warn you right now.  

475
00:29:39, 430 --> 00:29:41, 250
I'll have both your
badges and your pensions.  

476
00:29:41, 310 --> 00:29:42, 920
Take your best shot.  

477
00:29:42, 980 --> 00:29:44, 610
We'll see whose badge goes first.  

478
00:29:44, 660 --> 00:29:45, 770
What the hell does that mean ?

479
00:29:45, 830 --> 00:29:50, 570
Witness statement putting your car at the
crime scene turned up missing from the box.  

480
00:29:50, 630 --> 00:29:54, 190
You don't want the feds in
this, Pat.  We're doing you a favor.  

481
00:29:59, 210 --> 00:30:00, 930
We're done here.  

482
00:30:01, 060 --> 00:30:05, 250
Not until you tell us how a bullet from
your gun ended up killing Wanda Johnson.  

483
00:30:17, 980 --> 00:30:19, 510
You're bluffing.  

484
00:30:20, 780 --> 00:30:23, 110
Came back a definitive match, Pat.  

485
00:30:28, 090 --> 00:30:30, 400
I'd like my FOP lawyer now.  

486
00:30:30, 480 --> 00:30:31, 960
I'm still waiting for the truth.  

487
00:30:32, 020 --> 00:30:33, 420
And I'd still like my lawyer.  

488
00:30:33, 520 --> 00:30:36, 710
STILLMAN: Night Wanda was shot
you were at Timmy Murphy's wake.  

489
00:30:36, 800 --> 00:30:38, 770
- The whole department was there.  
- Yeah.  So what ?

490
00:30:38, 840 --> 00:30:40, 570
I know what you're doing here, Pat.  

491
00:30:40, 720 --> 00:30:42, 100
Stay out of this, John.  

492
00:30:42, 170 --> 00:30:43, 360
You left your gun at home.  

493
00:30:43, 440 --> 00:30:44, 830
- No.  
- Car was in the Badlands.  

494
00:30:44, 960 --> 00:30:47, 980
I know all about your boy
Matt's struggle with drugs.  

495
00:30:48, 040 --> 00:30:50, 790
This had nothing to do with my
son, and I'll stand for the gun.  

496
00:30:50, 850 --> 00:30:54, 780
That girl's mother has been
twisting in the wind for 16 years.  

497
00:30:54, 840 --> 00:30:57, 640
I said Matty didn't do this.  

498
00:30:57, 720 --> 00:30:59, 700
How do you know that ?

499
00:31:00, 250 --> 00:31:02, 320
Because I asked him.  

500
00:31:07, 320 --> 00:31:08, 450
What's this ?

501
00:31:08, 550 --> 00:31:10, 900
I was gonna tell you about that.  

502
00:31:11, 000 --> 00:31:12, 120
I'm listening.  

503
00:31:12, 190 --> 00:31:14, 160
- Me and Ronnie.  .  .  
- You went out drinking ?

504
00:31:14, 230 --> 00:31:17, 060
- No !
- Don't lie to me.  

505
00:31:17, 320 --> 00:31:20, 940
Okay.  Just a little.  

506
00:31:21, 860 --> 00:31:23, 340
How'd this happen ?

507
00:31:23, 400 --> 00:31:25, 730
Ronnie got sick, and it was an accident.  

508
00:31:25, 820 --> 00:31:28, 420
But we cleaned it up, though.  

509
00:31:30, 250 --> 00:31:32, 850
Anything else you want to tell me ?

510
00:31:42, 290 --> 00:31:44, 710
I wanted to believe him.  

511
00:31:44, 820 --> 00:31:47, 190
- How'd he get your gun ?
- I don't know.  

512
00:31:47, 260 --> 00:31:51, 030
But you knew enough when you heard about the
shooting to make that plate match go away.  

513
00:31:51, 100 --> 00:31:52, 780
You knew Matty was involved.  

514
00:31:52, 850 --> 00:31:55, 870
- No.  
- Buried that witness report.  

515
00:31:55, 930 --> 00:31:58, 570
What kind of cop does that ?

516
00:31:59, 960 --> 00:32:02, 050
He was my son.  

517
00:32:02, 140 --> 00:32:04, 230
I was trying to protect him.  

518
00:32:05, 600 --> 00:32:07, 230
It was that damn Ronnie Tavares.  

519
00:32:07, 300 --> 00:32:09, 450
I told Matt to stay away from him.  

520
00:32:09, 500 --> 00:32:12, 370
We'll talk to him.  

521
00:32:14, 200 --> 00:32:17, 860
Matt's turned his life around.  

522
00:32:20, 420 --> 00:32:23, 510
He's got a family and
a son of his own now.  

523
00:32:23, 610 --> 00:32:28, 520
Then maybe he'll understand the
hell he's put Althea Johnson through.  

524
00:32:43, 300 --> 00:32:45, 870
Good to see you've pulled
yourself together, Matt.  

525
00:32:45, 940 --> 00:32:48, 300
I understand you're a father now.  

526
00:32:48, 940 --> 00:32:52, 630
- Lieutenant.  .  .  
- You know what this is about ?

527
00:32:53, 270 --> 00:32:54, 990
Remember Wanda ?

528
00:32:57, 800 --> 00:33:00, 990
We got your old running buddy
Ronnie Tavares in the other room.  

529
00:33:01, 090 --> 00:33:06, 350
Really made something of himself:
meth addict, petty theft, distribution.  

530
00:33:06, 420 --> 00:33:08, 670
He's ready to cooperate.  

531
00:33:08, 750 --> 00:33:10, 630
My father know about this ?

532
00:33:10, 720 --> 00:33:12, 990
He's prepared to take the fall for you.  

533
00:33:13, 070 --> 00:33:16, 160
You gonna let that happen, Matt ?

534
00:33:17, 320 --> 00:33:18, 170
No.  

535
00:33:18, 260 --> 00:33:20, 880
It's time to man up here, son.  

536
00:33:22, 980 --> 00:33:25, 630
How'd you know Wanda ?

537
00:33:26, 380 --> 00:33:28, 570
We met at a party the week before.  

538
00:33:28, 640 --> 00:33:30, 990
She was still in high school.  

539
00:33:31, 090 --> 00:33:33, 000
She didn't look it.  

540
00:33:33, 090 --> 00:33:35, 580
How'd you meet her that night ?

541
00:33:35, 660 --> 00:33:39, 050
We cruised by the school, picked her up.  

542
00:33:39, 240 --> 00:33:41, 210
("Tumbling Dice" by The
Rolling Stones playing)

543
00:33:41, 290 --> 00:33:43, 230
I didn't even rember her name.  

544
00:33:46, 290 --> 00:33:49, 120
Mm-hmm, yeah Yo, Wanda.  

545
00:33:49, 240 --> 00:33:50, 840
Yo, Wanda, it's
me-- Ronnie.  

546
00:33:50, 960 --> 00:33:51, 890
Yeah, so ?

547
00:33:52, 400 --> 00:33:53, 620
Yo, yo, yo, let's just go do this, man.  

548
00:33:53, 680 --> 00:33:55, 060
Yo, in a minute, fool, relax.  

549
00:33:55, 170 --> 00:33:57, 770
Yo, you're looking good, baby.  Let
me holla at you for a second.  

550
00:33:58, 900 --> 00:34:00, 110
- Holla.  
- So.  .  .  

551
00:34:00, 170 --> 00:34:03, 350
me and my boy Matt right here--we're
trying to get in a little adventure.  

552
00:34:03, 740 --> 00:34:05, 770
- That so ?
- Yes.  

553
00:34:05, 890 --> 00:34:07, 070
What you doing ?

554
00:34:07, 130 --> 00:34:08, 500
Waiting on my mom.  

555
00:34:08, 580 --> 00:34:10, 370
Looks like she forgot you.  

556
00:34:10, 500 --> 00:34:12, 540
Yo, you know we can
give you a ride, right ?

557
00:34:12, 860 --> 00:34:14, 700
Come on.  

558
00:34:17, 520 --> 00:34:18, 190
Madam.  

559
00:34:20, 900 --> 00:34:22, 210
All right ?

560
00:34:26, 820 --> 00:34:28, 500
Listen up, Ronnie.  

561
00:34:28, 570 --> 00:34:30, 240
We got Matt Doherty next door.  

562
00:34:30, 310 --> 00:34:31, 460
Yeah, good for you.  

563
00:34:31, 530 --> 00:34:33, 240
Wrong, bad for you, Ronnie.  

564
00:34:33, 310 --> 00:34:34, 830
Matt's got his life together.  

565
00:34:34, 900 --> 00:34:36, 710
Plus his dad's a cop, big time.  

566
00:34:36, 830 --> 00:34:39, 090
Means he knows the art of the deal.  

567
00:34:39, 210 --> 00:34:41, 800
I know how to deal.  

568
00:34:41, 880 --> 00:34:43, 130
What'd Matt say ?

569
00:34:43, 210 --> 00:34:45, 560
Says you lured Wanda into that car.  

570
00:34:46, 550 --> 00:34:48, 930
- He said that ?
- Said you were gonna give her a ride home.  

571
00:34:49, 390 --> 00:34:51, 870
- Right.  
- But you end up in the Badlands ?

572
00:34:51, 920 --> 00:34:53, 910
- Detour.  
- For what ?

573
00:34:53, 970 --> 00:34:55, 900
Show that dealer what's what.  

574
00:34:55, 950 --> 00:34:57, 830
He ripped us off the week before.  

575
00:34:57, 910 --> 00:35:00, 760
Huh, so.  .  .  

576
00:35:02, 520 --> 00:35:04, 290
That what the gun was for ?

577
00:35:04, 360 --> 00:35:07, 430
That's not my gun, and it wasn't my idea.  

578
00:35:07, 510 --> 00:35:10, 050
Matt's painting a picture
putting it all on you.  

579
00:35:10, 130 --> 00:35:15, 360
Matt.  .  .   he was tripping about
that dealer getting over on us.  

580
00:35:26, 730 --> 00:35:28, 600
- That's him.  
- All right, so how you want to do this ?

581
00:35:28, 660 --> 00:35:30, 760
Do what ?I said I wanted to go home.  

582
00:35:30, 840 --> 00:35:33, 360
Yo, chill, baby, relax, We just
got some business to attend to.  

583
00:35:33, 420 --> 00:35:35, 430
Now you're allBoyz n the Hood ?

584
00:35:36, 040 --> 00:35:37, 250
Just tell him you want something.  

585
00:35:37, 300 --> 00:35:39, 450
I'm not telling him nothing.  

586
00:35:39, 900 --> 00:35:41, 060
Check this.  

587
00:35:41, 130 --> 00:35:42, 690
- Come on.  Are you serious ?
- What the hell ?

588
00:35:42, 750 --> 00:35:44, 110
We're just gonna go straight at 'em, man.  

589
00:35:44, 170 --> 00:35:45, 760
You can't go point that
thing at a dealer, fool.  

590
00:35:45, 810 --> 00:35:47, 050
These guys shoot back, man.  

591
00:35:47, 120 --> 00:35:48, 820
Just gonna put a little
scare into him, okay ?

592
00:35:48, 910 --> 00:35:50, 210
You get my back with his boys.  

593
00:35:50, 500 --> 00:35:52, 810
You guys are crazy.  I'm out.  

594
00:35:52, 870 --> 00:35:54, 340
Give me that thing, man.  

595
00:35:54, 510 --> 00:35:55, 980
- This is no time to.  .  .  
- Get off of it !Stop !

596
00:36:00, 270 --> 00:36:03, 170
Ronnie should have
never grabbed that gun.  

597
00:36:03, 300 --> 00:36:05, 120
It was an accident.  

598
00:36:05, 230 --> 00:36:09, 030
It also an accident you don't
take Wanda to the hospital ?

599
00:36:12, 490 --> 00:36:15, 350
Lot of things I should
have done different.  

600
00:36:15, 460 --> 00:36:17, 650
Worried about what
your father would say ?

601
00:36:20, 250 --> 00:36:22, 190
It was all I could think about.  

602
00:36:23, 680 --> 00:36:24, 960
What the hell did you just do, man ?

603
00:36:25, 030 --> 00:36:26, 750
Me ?You grabbed the gun !

604
00:36:26, 950 --> 00:36:28, 100
We got to get her to a hospital, man.  

605
00:36:28, 150 --> 00:36:29, 700
It was an accident.  That's what
we're gonna tell 'em, right ?

606
00:36:29, 780 --> 00:36:31, 290
- It was an accident.  
- Wanda.  

607
00:36:31, 360 --> 00:36:32, 530
Yo.  

608
00:36:32, 620 --> 00:36:34, 440
- Oh, man.  
- Wanda.  

609
00:36:34, 700 --> 00:36:35, 520
Oh, no.  

610
00:36:35, 590 --> 00:36:36, 370
Oh, man, what are we gonna do, man ?

611
00:36:36, 460 --> 00:36:39, 570
- I don't know.  
-Go, man, we got to get her out of this car !

612
00:36:40, 650 --> 00:36:44, 400
Ronnie said we had to get rid of
the body, so that's what we did.  

613
00:36:44, 520 --> 00:36:47, 090
Just dump her like that.  

614
00:36:49, 070 --> 00:36:53, 170
I cleaned out the car, put the gun back.  

615
00:36:53, 240 --> 00:36:55, 020
Then lied to your father.  

616
00:36:55, 080 --> 00:36:57, 300
But he knew, didn't he ?

617
00:36:57, 500 --> 00:37:00, 190
Yeah, I could see it in his eyes.  

618
00:37:01, 670 --> 00:37:05, 400
All these years sober.  

619
00:37:05, 470 --> 00:37:09, 140
It's like I've been waiting
for this day to come.  

620
00:37:10, 650 --> 00:37:13, 660
So has Althea Johnson.  

621
00:37:18, 830 --> 00:37:19, 800
All right.  

622
00:37:19, 910 --> 00:37:22, 850
Unit number for Cliff
Harper is on the left.  

623
00:37:24, 520 --> 00:37:26, 930
No lights on.  Nobody's home.  

624
00:37:26, 980 --> 00:37:29, 720
Record for assault, domestic violence.  

625
00:37:29, 780 --> 00:37:31, 340
Guy's a real charmer.  

626
00:37:31, 430 --> 00:37:32, 630
Let's pull around back.  

627
00:37:32, 690 --> 00:37:34, 390
See if we can find a way in.  

628
00:38:09, 380 --> 00:38:11, 180
Christina.  

629
00:38:12, 450 --> 00:38:14, 090
Lil ?

630
00:38:14, 310 --> 00:38:16, 220
He did this to you ?

631
00:38:17, 870 --> 00:38:20, 450
He won't leave us alone.  

632
00:38:21, 280 --> 00:38:24, 900
Cliff-- where
is he, Chris ?

633
00:38:25, 170 --> 00:38:28, 530
No matter what I do, he always finds us.  

634
00:38:28, 660 --> 00:38:30, 420
I'm so sorry, Lil.  

635
00:38:30, 500 --> 00:38:32, 850
What do you mean "us" ?

636
00:38:32, 910 --> 00:38:34, 190
You have to get out of here.  

637
00:38:34, 300 --> 00:38:35, 310
No, we're not leaving without you.  

638
00:38:35, 380 --> 00:38:38, 470
It hurts to breathe.  

639
00:38:40, 030 --> 00:38:41, 600
Can you walk ?

640
00:38:41, 690 --> 00:38:43, 940
I tried.  

641
00:38:44, 580 --> 00:38:47, 320
I can't leave.  

642
00:38:47, 410 --> 00:38:49, 020
I'm not like you.  

643
00:38:49, 090 --> 00:38:50, 450
Need to get her out of here.  

644
00:38:50, 520 --> 00:38:59, 390
I thought if I just left her with a friend
and came home, I could get it together.  

645
00:38:59, 490 --> 00:39:00, 720
Left, left who ?

646
00:39:00, 800 --> 00:39:07, 010
Then I could come and get her and
then we could be like that again.  

647
00:39:07, 090 --> 00:39:09, 020
What are you talking about ?

648
00:39:09, 120 --> 00:39:10, 710
Christina, we have to go.  

649
00:39:10, 790 --> 00:39:17, 060
Like at the beach.  .  .   in
the photo that Dad gave me.  

650
00:39:17, 780 --> 00:39:19, 920
You remember that day, Lil ?

651
00:39:20, 100 --> 00:39:22, 380
- Yeah.  
- When he came back ?

652
00:39:22, 480 --> 00:39:24, 700
Yeah, yeah, sweetie, I remember.  

653
00:39:34, 750 --> 00:39:37, 160
Can you help us rebuild it, Dad ?

654
00:39:38, 010 --> 00:39:41, 370
I thought we were going
to be like that again.  

655
00:39:41, 470 --> 00:39:43, 840
Sisters.  

656
00:39:44, 510 --> 00:39:47, 060
Sure, Chris, why not ?

657
00:39:47, 270 --> 00:39:51, 440
I want it to be like that for her.  

658
00:39:51, 580 --> 00:39:52, 630
Let's get her out.  

659
00:39:52, 730 --> 00:39:53, 730
Let's go.  

660
00:39:53, 850 --> 00:39:57, 670
- I got to go, Lil, 'cause I got to switch out the laundry.  
- It's okay.  

661
00:40:36, 040 --> 00:40:38, 900
Christina, time to get up.  

662
00:40:43, 070 --> 00:40:44, 970
The hell ?

663
00:40:51, 190 --> 00:40:53, 380
How could you do that to my sister ? !

664
00:40:56, 990 --> 00:40:58, 420
Don't.  

665
00:40:58, 500 --> 00:41:01, 640
You don't want to do that, Lil.  

666
00:41:02, 670 --> 00:41:04, 840
Come on.  

667
00:41:07, 870 --> 00:41:10, 040
Let's go home.  

668
00:41:32, 330 --> 00:41:35, 390
