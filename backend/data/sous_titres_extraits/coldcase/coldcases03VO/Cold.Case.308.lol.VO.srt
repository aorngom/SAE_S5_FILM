1
00:00:00,175 --> 00:00:02,732
The following story is fictional and does
not depict any actual person or event

2
00:00:19,598 --> 00:00:21,206
What do you have there, Ned?

3
00:00:21,206 --> 00:00:23,505
It's for my dad

4
00:00:33,084 --> 00:00:35,113
Neddie!

5
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,677
Neddie, could you take that bowl of
potato chips into the family room?

6
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:45,700
I've got batter on my hands

7
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,586
Mom, I drew a picture of Dad's plane
with the exact way

8
00:00:48,586 --> 00:00:51,418
that the wings were
decorated, OK? / OK, Neddie

9
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:56,759
Because, you said he's not flying in that anymore
so he needs something to remember it by

10
00:00:58,741 --> 00:01:03,002
Mom,  I need you to start
the shrimp rounds

11
00:01:11,617 --> 00:01:14,216
Who are you?

12
00:01:14,216 --> 00:01:15,668
Who are you?

13
00:01:15,668 --> 00:01:17,634
I'm Ned

14
00:01:17,634 --> 00:01:20,454
Well then I'm your dad, Ned

15
00:01:20,454 --> 00:01:23,145
You don't look like my dad

16
00:01:23,145 --> 00:01:25,270
I have his picture

17
00:01:25,654 --> 00:01:28,767
I'm a lot handsomer now
than I used to be

18
00:01:32,128 --> 00:01:33,855
I'm home

19
00:01:33,855 --> 00:01:39,200
Oh, my God Carl

20
00:01:51,263 --> 00:01:53,620
Hi

21
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,258
- I remember you
- Hi

22
00:02:10,342 --> 00:02:12,946
I made this

23
00:02:14,437 --> 00:02:16,826
It's real

24
00:02:16,826 --> 00:02:19,775
These are the bracelets
with your name on them

25
00:02:19,775 --> 00:02:24,983
Everybody wore 'em
while you were in Vietnam

26
00:02:29,922 --> 00:02:33,894
Big boys don't cry, Dad

27
00:02:33,894 --> 00:02:39,058
I'm cryin' because your mom
spent so much money on this box

28
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:41,053
No, I made it

29
00:02:41,053 --> 00:02:43,983
Oh, yeah?

30
00:03:10,476 --> 00:03:13,478
Apr '73  Burton, C

31
00:03:25,304 --> 00:03:27,597
Lieutenant Stillman

32
00:03:28,574 --> 00:03:30,901
Kat Miller, narcotics
I called you

33
00:03:30,901 --> 00:03:32,688
Detective Rush and Valens

34
00:03:32,688 --> 00:03:34,443
Glad you could come down

35
00:03:34,443 --> 00:03:38,070
We found something interesting
tossed in this place

36
00:03:39,674 --> 00:03:41,350
What are they?

37
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,296
POW bracelets

38
00:03:43,296 --> 00:03:46,258
All with the same name on 'em
Carl Burton

39
00:03:46,258 --> 00:03:47,634
He was a Navy pilot

40
00:03:47,634 --> 00:03:50,672
Prisoner of war in Vietnam
He was shot to death back here in '73

41
00:03:50,672 --> 00:03:52,259
You remember that all from cuff?

42
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:53,349
He was a war hero

43
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:55,518
Never brought the job in?

44
00:03:55,518 --> 00:03:56,767
Where'd you find this?

45
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:59,003
Behind the water heater in the cellar

46
00:03:59,003 --> 00:04:00,771
I just thought that was off

47
00:04:00,771 --> 00:04:03,088
Something sentimental to a murder victim
being stuffed down there

48
00:04:03,088 --> 00:04:05,326
So, were these like dog tags?

49
00:04:05,326 --> 00:04:07,431
Friends and family wore 'em,
not the soldier

50
00:04:07,431 --> 00:04:09,659
POWs who made it home like Carl did,

51
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,078
someone would gather them up
and make a presentation

52
00:04:12,078 --> 00:04:15,109
Anyone you drag out of this place
know how they wound up here?

53
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:16,681
House was empty when we hit it

54
00:04:16,681 --> 00:04:18,357
Skimpy new direction

55
00:04:18,357 --> 00:04:19,754
He's a POW, Scotty

56
00:04:19,754 --> 00:04:22,840
We got anything,
we're gonna go with it

57
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,919
Yeah OK, sure

58
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:28,018
In fact, think of Carl Burton like family

59
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,796
That's how I want this job worked

60
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,192
Carl Burton, 35,
Lieutenant Commander, US Navy

61
00:05:13,192 --> 00:05:16,416
Shot down on his 23rd
bombing mission over Hanoi

62
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,732
Go up enough times,
luck runs out

63
00:05:18,732 --> 00:05:22,298
His got even worse, was captured,
spent 5 years in a prison camp

64
00:05:22,298 --> 00:05:24,885
Survives all that, gets gunned
down in his own area code

65
00:05:24,885 --> 00:05:26,539
7 months after he's home

66
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:28,765
Last place Carl's seen
was a funeral reception

67
00:05:28,765 --> 00:05:30,970
of a POW buddy of his,
Rex Potter

68
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,945
He was a Roxborough guy same as Carl,
didn't make it out of the prison camp

69
00:05:34,945 --> 00:05:37,353
Interviews with the family,
people at the Potter house that night,

70
00:05:37,353 --> 00:05:39,155
no one sees anything unusual

71
00:05:39,155 --> 00:05:41,664
Carl's body was found
a mile from the reception,

72
00:05:41,664 --> 00:05:46,532
gun was a few feet from him
but rain washed away any prints

73
00:05:46,532 --> 00:05:49,022
And a bag of marijuana
in his pocket

74
00:05:49,022 --> 00:05:50,992
Well a funeral's gotta
be intense, right?

75
00:05:50,992 --> 00:05:53,379
Put Carl in the mood
for some kind of escape?

76
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:55,162
He scores, gets shot
on the way home,

77
00:05:55,162 --> 00:05:56,560
being in the wrong neighborhood

78
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,356
That doesn't explain
the bracelets in that house

79
00:05:58,356 --> 00:06:00,184
Maybe he tried to trade 'em
to the dealer

80
00:06:00,184 --> 00:06:01,616
No, they're not worth anything

81
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:02,958
Could be why he got shot

82
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,378
Let's talk to Carl's wife and son,

83
00:06:04,378 --> 00:06:07,228
see what they remember
about the day of the funeral

84
00:06:07,228 --> 00:06:09,969
Could be another vet
burnout story, John

85
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:14,230
Lot of guys we served with
came home, turned to junk

86
00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:17,558
Whatever we find,
we follow it up

87
00:06:29,862 --> 00:06:32,213
You didn't have to fix up,
Mrs Burton

88
00:06:32,213 --> 00:06:34,868
Military wife, look right, live right

89
00:06:34,868 --> 00:06:36,210
May I get you a drink?

90
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,308
Pretty early

91
00:06:38,308 --> 00:06:42,079
Cocktail hours somewhere,
boys used to say

92
00:06:43,173 --> 00:06:45,413
We're here about
your husband's murder

93
00:06:45,413 --> 00:06:46,558
Something come up?

94
00:06:46,558 --> 00:06:50,841
We found his POW bracelets
in an abandoned house in Tioga

95
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:53,572
Kind of sketchy area back
when Carl was killed

96
00:06:53,572 --> 00:06:56,021
It's even worse now

97
00:06:57,727 --> 00:06:58,991
OK

98
00:06:58,991 --> 00:07:01,856
Any idea how the bracelets
wound up there?

99
00:07:01,856 --> 00:07:04,105
No

100
00:07:05,187 --> 00:07:07,313
This is embarassing but,

101
00:07:07,313 --> 00:07:09,235
I guess I lost track of them

102
00:07:09,235 --> 00:07:12,150
You don't seem like the
losing track type

103
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,690
No, but I lost track of myself
for a time then

104
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,995
Carl was carrying pot when he died

105
00:07:17,995 --> 00:07:19,936
The theory was that he had a habit

106
00:07:19,936 --> 00:07:21,386
Got him in to trouble that night

107
00:07:21,386 --> 00:07:24,554
Doesn't sound like
the gung-ho fighter pilot I married

108
00:07:24,554 --> 00:07:26,923
How about the guy
who came home to you in '72?

109
00:07:26,923 --> 00:07:28,910
I don't think about that man

110
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,673
I'd rather remember Carl
as he was before

111
00:07:31,673 --> 00:07:33,180
He was strong

112
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,008
He was a hero,
I was his wife

113
00:07:36,008 --> 00:07:40,842
Would you have known
if he was doing drugs? /No

114
00:07:40,842 --> 00:07:43,228
We really tried

115
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:47,777
We just never got to
know each other ever again

116
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:07,922
This is very romantic

117
00:08:07,922 --> 00:08:11,511
Did you turn into a champagne girl
while I was gone?

118
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:14,056
Come on, now

119
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,319
After sleeping for years with a guy
in skivvies, showered once a week

120
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,396
I'm finally looking good

121
00:08:39,871 --> 00:08:42,167
Remember when I broke up with you?

122
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:45,460
You left a pathetic note
in my parents' mail box

123
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,409
'I need to be free'

124
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:50,744
You came up to me in the parking lot
and I'm thinking

125
00:08:50,744 --> 00:08:55,625
'Oh, no, here she comes
She'd better not cry'

126
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,346
Remember?

127
00:08:57,346 --> 00:08:59,638
I knew better than you even then

128
00:08:59,638 --> 00:09:04,694
'Carl, I got your note
I don't think so'

129
00:09:04,694 --> 00:09:07,469
That's right

130
00:09:25,017 --> 00:09:27,507
I feel 18

131
00:09:29,048 --> 00:09:30,698
What is it, your shoulders?

132
00:09:30,698 --> 00:09:35,490
It's OK
Come back

133
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,388
Honey, no
Not if it hurts you

134
00:09:38,388 --> 00:09:40,855
Come on

135
00:09:40,855 --> 00:09:44,021
We'll dance later
when you're better

136
00:09:44,021 --> 00:09:45,922
I don't want you to pretend
it doesn't hurt

137
00:09:45,922 --> 00:09:48,022
Let me pretend!

138
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:49,668
My arms have been broken 4 times

139
00:09:49,668 --> 00:09:52,253
They're busted
They'll always be

140
00:09:52,253 --> 00:09:58,320
I, I can't lift 'em
I can't dance

141
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:02,631
Sorry

142
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:07,270
I should make sure
Ned didn't wake up

143
00:10:08,093 --> 00:10:10,573
I'm goin' for a walk

144
00:10:10,573 --> 00:10:13,464
You don't need to wait for me

145
00:10:25,368 --> 00:10:28,063
He'd go for walks

146
00:10:28,063 --> 00:10:29,935
For hours

147
00:10:30,987 --> 00:10:33,607
Is that when this started?

148
00:10:35,638 --> 00:10:38,976
Any idea where'd he go
on these walks?

149
00:10:39,831 --> 00:10:43,162
I didn't know where Carl was, truly

150
00:10:43,162 --> 00:10:44,955
Even when he was right in front of me

151
00:10:44,955 --> 00:10:46,776
But you two stayed together

152
00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:50,750
Hoping somehow
we'd find what we lost

153
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,435
But before we could,

154
00:10:54,435 --> 00:10:57,027
he was gone again

155
00:10:58,972 --> 00:11:01,139
Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania

156
00:11:02,043 --> 00:11:05,978
So, you're not the kind
doc sees patients?

157
00:11:05,978 --> 00:11:08,448
No, I'm the kind who does the research

158
00:11:08,448 --> 00:11:09,906
Better hours?

159
00:11:09,906 --> 00:11:12,066
Better company

160
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:13,587
So where did the bracelets turn up?

161
00:11:13,587 --> 00:11:16,331
Stashed away
In a crack house

162
00:11:16,331 --> 00:11:17,575
Were they in the box?

163
00:11:17,575 --> 00:11:19,711
Yeah, there was a box

164
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:21,054
I made that thing

165
00:11:21,054 --> 00:11:22,944
Thinkin' is, your dad wanted
to buy drugs,

166
00:11:22,944 --> 00:11:25,022
maybe he got desperate,
tried to pawn the bracelets

167
00:11:25,022 --> 00:11:27,947
Not exactly what you want to believe
about your father but

168
00:11:27,947 --> 00:11:31,059
We know you were young
when he got home / 7

169
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:34,562
You remember anything that looking
back makes you think he was usin'?

170
00:11:34,562 --> 00:11:40,596
No  In fact from the day he got back
he never missed Triple Nickel Reveille

171
00:11:40,596 --> 00:11:43,593
- Wakin' up early?
- 5:55 AM

172
00:11:43,593 --> 00:11:47,014
Exercised best he could,
started his day

173
00:11:47,014 --> 00:11:48,938
Not junkie behavior

174
00:11:48,938 --> 00:11:50,698
When'd'ya last see those bracelets?

175
00:11:50,698 --> 00:11:54,018
First week he was back,
he put 'em in the basement

176
00:11:54,018 --> 00:11:56,773
He wasn't big on war mementos

177
00:11:56,773 --> 00:11:58,951
- Tryin' to move on
- Yeah

178
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:02,871
Anyone around back then
who could of got in the way of that?

179
00:12:03,358 --> 00:12:08,079
There was someone
Who we shouldn't of even known about

180
00:12:09,503 --> 00:12:11,960
Liberty City Zoo

181
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:17,927
So these people,
they made me stay over in Vietnam

182
00:12:17,927 --> 00:12:20,429
That why you didn't
write me any letters?

183
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:22,009
Only way I could even
talk to my friends there

184
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:24,275
was through a secret code
we made up

185
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:25,739
A secret code?

186
00:12:25,739 --> 00:12:27,772
Well each letter has its own
number of taps

187
00:12:27,772 --> 00:12:30,702
We'd spell out words on the walls
between our rooms

188
00:12:30,702 --> 00:12:34,745
Wow  Like, could you do an N?

189
00:12:38,398 --> 00:12:40,237
Do E

190
00:12:43,606 --> 00:12:45,375
D

191
00:12:48,287 --> 00:12:49,608
That's my name, right?

192
00:12:49,608 --> 00:12:52,118
That's Ned in your secret code

193
00:12:52,118 --> 00:12:54,241
Do another

194
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,849
I don't know, what's it mean?

195
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:06,158
I said 'bear'
Wanna go see the bears?

196
00:13:06,158 --> 00:13:11,729
When I come here with Ken,
we always go see the lions first

197
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:14,775
Who's Ken?

198
00:13:14,775 --> 00:13:17,116
Mommy's friend

199
00:13:17,116 --> 00:13:19,192
What kind of friend?

200
00:13:19,192 --> 00:13:23,534
Well he takes me to the zoo
and he takes Mommy to dinner

201
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:33,844
At some level
I knew I shouldn't have said that

202
00:13:33,844 --> 00:13:38,957
'Cause you knew this Ken was
your mom's special friend?

203
00:13:38,957 --> 00:13:42,993
Guess I was a little messed up
about the dueling father figures

204
00:13:42,993 --> 00:13:46,796
Because truthfully, I knew Ken a lot
better than my dad at that point

205
00:13:46,796 --> 00:13:48,514
Your dad follow up with this guy?

206
00:13:48,514 --> 00:13:51,251
Not that I heard about

207
00:13:51,251 --> 00:13:53,496
If I spent  5 years
in a box getting tortured

208
00:13:53,496 --> 00:13:55,943
while some guy's taking
my wife to dinner

209
00:13:55,943 --> 00:13:57,948
I'd follow up

210
00:13:59,598 --> 00:14:02,703
Janet Burton didn't mention anyone
on the scene while Carl was gone?

211
00:14:02,703 --> 00:14:04,499
Played the pained and patient wife

212
00:14:04,499 --> 00:14:06,741
Not big on airing dirty laundry

213
00:14:06,741 --> 00:14:08,302
Doesn't she want to know
what happened to Carl?

214
00:14:08,302 --> 00:14:09,950
Seemed afraid of
what we might find,

215
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,384
him not turning out to be
the perfect hero

216
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,803
- The house with the bracelets
- Yeah, what'd you find?

217
00:14:14,803 --> 00:14:16,920
Back in '73,
place still had renters

218
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,263
before crack ran 'em out

219
00:14:18,263 --> 00:14:20,989
One of 'em, Ken Westin

220
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,832
Our perfect wife's boyfriend

221
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:31,925
Step lively
lively, quietly

222
00:14:31,925 --> 00:14:34,247
Giving you a heads up, Dorothy

223
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:37,323
Tour groups heading
to ceramics, over

224
00:14:37,323 --> 00:14:40,283
- Ken Westin?
- Absolutely

225
00:14:40,283 --> 00:14:41,646
Detective Valens, homicide

226
00:14:41,646 --> 00:14:45,684
Mind if I ask you to step to this side
of the rope here, please

227
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:49,276
We found some POW bracelets
hidden in your old house, Ken

228
00:14:49,276 --> 00:14:51,954
Belonged to a murder victim
Carl Burton?

229
00:14:51,954 --> 00:14:56,129
Whoa
Carl's bracelets?

230
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,081
I must've left those when I moved

231
00:14:58,081 --> 00:15:01,475
Why were they in your house
in the first place?

232
00:15:01,475 --> 00:15:04,510
Already got the skinny on your
relationship with Janet,

233
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:07,696
so you can pick up from there

234
00:15:08,588 --> 00:15:13,806
I'm confessin' to the act of a
heart-sick young man, OK?

235
00:15:13,806 --> 00:15:18,484
I took 'em
The day she broke up with me

236
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:22,541
To make myself feel better,
I snatched the bracelets

237
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:25,220
- Low, I know
- It's real low, Ken

238
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,415
- The guy was a POW
- I appreciate that

239
00:15:28,415 --> 00:15:34,658
I was over there, too
11 months before illness befell me

240
00:15:34,658 --> 00:15:40,306
So, let's say the bracelet snatch
doesn't do the trick and your still stewin'

241
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:43,535
Makes me wonder where you were,
the night Carl got shot

242
00:15:43,535 --> 00:15:48,993
I was at Smokie's,
my regular night spot, sheesh!

243
00:15:48,993 --> 00:15:52,769
I stole from the guy
I did not wish him to be dead

244
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:54,676
Know anyone who might've?

245
00:15:54,676 --> 00:15:57,911
I'll tell you this,
when he came back,

246
00:15:57,911 --> 00:16:01,317
Carl wasn't exactly winning friends
and influencing people

247
00:16:01,317 --> 00:16:04,187
- What d'you mean?
- A little unstable

248
00:16:04,187 --> 00:16:05,786
And you'd know how?

249
00:16:05,786 --> 00:16:08,339
Did some research,
check up on the guy,

250
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:10,824
make sure he was worthy

251
00:16:17,174 --> 00:16:19,315
I asked you to take
that down, Wes

252
00:16:19,315 --> 00:16:20,832
You kiddin' me hero?

253
00:16:20,832 --> 00:16:22,665
That signs worth at least
two cars a month

254
00:16:22,665 --> 00:16:26,216
I mean three if I could
teach you a little hustle

255
00:16:33,748 --> 00:16:35,530
She's a beauty

256
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,527
Can I send you home
together today?

257
00:16:37,527 --> 00:16:42,025
Oh, hello
I need to think about it

258
00:16:43,808 --> 00:16:46,137
Excuse me, man

259
00:16:57,465 --> 00:16:59,235
You can't keep showin' up here Daniel

260
00:16:59,235 --> 00:17:00,505
- You gonna talk to me?
- No!

261
00:17:00,505 --> 00:17:02,226
Well you gotta some day

262
00:17:02,226 --> 00:17:05,169
The kid's got hustle
washing cars for free, you know?

263
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:06,632
I told you to beat it

264
00:17:06,632 --> 00:17:09,374
Look,  I just wanna know
about my dad

265
00:17:09,374 --> 00:17:11,672
OK, I've asked you three times,
now I'm doing your work for you,

266
00:17:11,672 --> 00:17:13,517
- I mean what's it gonna take?
- Leave this alone

267
00:17:13,517 --> 00:17:15,801
- Leave my father alone?
- Believe me,

268
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:19,281
there are some things
you don't wanna know

269
00:17:19,768 --> 00:17:22,580
Now get outta here!

270
00:17:25,165 --> 00:17:28,710
You know,
I've been real nice to you, Carl

271
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,915
You're gonna wish
you were nicer to me

272
00:17:37,801 --> 00:17:42,153
So, who was this kid Daniel?

273
00:17:42,153 --> 00:17:43,826
I can't say for sure,

274
00:17:43,826 --> 00:17:46,875
since I was no longer
a member of the inner circle

275
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,004
But this looked like
a personal thing to you?

276
00:17:49,004 --> 00:17:51,405
The kid got under Carl's skin

277
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:53,786
And I'd done enough research

278
00:17:53,786 --> 00:17:57,977
That was the last time I saw
the moody son of a gun

279
00:18:00,219 --> 00:18:03,257
Ken Westin was a mistake,
he was a neighborhood guy,

280
00:18:03,257 --> 00:18:06,601
kept me company while Carl was

281
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:09,284
Oh, he was pretty wounded
when you two broke up

282
00:18:09,284 --> 00:18:11,360
Stole Carl's bracelets

283
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,609
Ken did it?
Oh, for Pete's sakes

284
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:17,603
Think he would've gone a step farther?
Got into it with Carl?

285
00:18:17,603 --> 00:18:20,298
Confrontation was not Ken's style

286
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:22,554
Janet, do you know anything
about a kid named Daniel?

287
00:18:22,554 --> 00:18:29,024
Yeah
Daniel He was

288
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:34,852
- Would coffee help you?
- No

289
00:18:34,852 --> 00:18:39,066
Daniel Potter,
his father Rex was a POW with Carl

290
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:40,881
Didn't make it home

291
00:18:40,881 --> 00:18:44,363
It was Rex's memorial
Carl went to the day he died

292
00:18:44,363 --> 00:18:48,583
Have any idea why Carl and Daniel
were fighting at the car dealership?

293
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,591
Daniel was hounding Carl

294
00:18:50,591 --> 00:18:53,322
Trying to get stuff out of him
about his father

295
00:18:53,322 --> 00:18:55,222
But Carl wouldn't talk about that

296
00:18:55,222 --> 00:18:58,067
He saw horrible things
in that prison camp

297
00:18:58,067 --> 00:19:02,127
He wouldn't revisit them
for anyone, not me, not Daniel

298
00:19:02,127 --> 00:19:03,820
When he said no to Daniel?

299
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,755
The kid put a rock
through our window

300
00:19:06,755 --> 00:19:08,914
He was angry at the world

301
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:12,460
But, taking it out on Carl

302
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,897
About their age?
When your dad was in prison? / Yeah

303
00:19:20,897 --> 00:19:23,173
Must've been rough

304
00:19:23,173 --> 00:19:25,018
Never knowing
if he was comin' home

305
00:19:25,018 --> 00:19:26,398
Well I thought it would
be easier somehow

306
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:28,767
if I knew the details
of what he was going through

307
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:33,098
- But Carl wouldn't say
- He was trying to protect me

308
00:19:33,098 --> 00:19:36,701
Pretty understanding for a guy
who threw a rock at Carl's house

309
00:19:36,701 --> 00:19:38,620
Yeah, well that was awful

310
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,165
You take it any further?

311
00:19:40,165 --> 00:19:42,417
Me being angry with Carl
stopped with the rock

312
00:19:42,417 --> 00:19:44,187
Yeah?
Why?

313
00:19:44,187 --> 00:19:46,402
He caught me red handed

314
00:19:46,402 --> 00:19:49,243
finally he gave me
what I wanted

315
00:19:53,506 --> 00:19:55,608
- You gonna pay to fix that?
- Let go of me / - No

316
00:19:55,608 --> 00:19:58,690
you wanna talk,
let's talk

317
00:19:59,138 --> 00:20:02,275
- Go ahead  We're getting this over with
- Where's my dad?

318
00:20:02,275 --> 00:20:04,498
- Still in prison in Hanoi
- Why? What did he do?

319
00:20:04,498 --> 00:20:08,573
He's an American soldier
To the North Vietnamese that's a crime

320
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:12,024
What's it like there?
The prison?

321
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:19,363
There's not a lot to eat
Water makes you sick

322
00:20:19,363 --> 00:20:23,185
Guards are monsters
in human clothes

323
00:20:23,185 --> 00:20:27,099
But your dad and the other guys,
they have each other

324
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:28,832
Can't they just get together
and break out of there?

325
00:20:28,832 --> 00:20:32,699
I mean my dad can take
some Vietnamese guy

326
00:20:34,113 --> 00:20:37,050
Maybe he will

327
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:41,176
- Is he gonna live?
- Yes

328
00:20:41,176 --> 00:20:44,147
Your dad's one of the
strongest people I've ever met

329
00:20:44,147 --> 00:20:49,974
If I had to trek in hell,
he's a guy I'd want by my side

330
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:54,033
He's comin' home to you

331
00:20:56,254 --> 00:21:01,461
You guys are brave
You are Carl

332
00:21:01,908 --> 00:21:05,179
I knew it

333
00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:12,419
Your dad, he's a hero
Not me

334
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:15,467
I'm a coward

335
00:21:18,231 --> 00:21:19,766
Coward?

336
00:21:19,766 --> 00:21:21,626
Why would Carl say that
about himself?

337
00:21:21,626 --> 00:21:23,860
It doesn't make sense, right?

338
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,115
Survived five years
of being tortured

339
00:21:26,115 --> 00:21:28,228
Humble guy

340
00:21:28,228 --> 00:21:30,192
Or troubled

341
00:21:30,192 --> 00:21:32,507
Ever get the feeling
he really meant that, Daniel?

342
00:21:32,507 --> 00:21:34,976
Saw him a few times after that
Talked to him about my dad

343
00:21:34,976 --> 00:21:41,138
But every time I could always feel it
Somethin' was eatin' him up

344
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:44,070
Carl Burton's military service record

345
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,358
I don't see anything in there that could
make the guy call himself a coward

346
00:21:46,358 --> 00:21:50,004
Awarded bronze star, purple heart

347
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:53,059
Oh, this is it
He took early release

348
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:54,002
What's that

349
00:21:54,002 --> 00:21:55,787
It means he left the prison camp early

350
00:21:55,787 --> 00:21:56,872
Thought you couldn't leave

351
00:21:56,872 --> 00:21:58,337
Well, not under honorable circumstances

352
00:21:58,337 --> 00:22:02,417
The code of conduct among POWs is that
the sickest and longest serving go first

353
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:03,847
But Carl wasn't either of those

354
00:22:03,847 --> 00:22:05,813
Then how does he get
to the front of the line?

355
00:22:05,813 --> 00:22:07,418
Tells the VC guards
what they want to hear,

356
00:22:07,418 --> 00:22:09,060
lets 'em use 'em for propaganda

357
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,660
That doesn't sound like
a gung-ho fighter pilot

358
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,525
- Why would he do that?
- Why?

359
00:22:13,525 --> 00:22:16,224
He's sick of gettin' beat nearly to death
five years in a row,

360
00:22:16,224 --> 00:22:19,970
misses family,
he's stowed in solitary

361
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:23,202
It's hard to know what a code like that
starts to mean at that point

362
00:22:23,202 --> 00:22:24,781
But a lot of guys did hang in

363
00:22:24,781 --> 00:22:27,403
Yeah, hundreds of 'em and they
would not have been fans of Carl's

364
00:22:27,403 --> 00:22:30,136
And they came home a week
before Carl was killed

365
00:22:30,136 --> 00:22:34,048
End of March '73,
main group of POWs got back

366
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:35,711
Any of 'em come back to Philly?

367
00:22:35,711 --> 00:22:37,830
A guy named Raitt from Antioch

368
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:40,423
Roger Raitt, a Navy Commander?

369
00:22:40,423 --> 00:22:42,587
You know him?

370
00:22:42,587 --> 00:22:44,706
I served with him

371
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,513
Been a long time

372
00:22:51,513 --> 00:22:53,547
I'm not much for the reunions

373
00:22:53,547 --> 00:22:58,524
Truth be told, I'm not either but
working in the defense industry,

374
00:22:58,524 --> 00:23:00,857
- it pays to keep in touch
- Sure

375
00:23:00,857 --> 00:23:02,996
There's one this Saturday,
in Old City

376
00:23:02,996 --> 00:23:05,793
I can't make small talk out of it,
I'd rather just leave it behind

377
00:23:05,793 --> 00:23:09,074
And here you are,
carrying a gun every day

378
00:23:09,074 --> 00:23:12,039
That's what I couldn't revisit

379
00:23:12,987 --> 00:23:17,742
Roger, I wanna talk to you about a guy
you were in prison with, Carl Burton?

380
00:23:17,742 --> 00:23:21,303
Wound up dead, shot
Right after you guys got back

381
00:23:21,303 --> 00:23:24,503
I remember / Comin' home it
had to be hard to adust

382
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:27,690
It made me realize
any day I wake up

383
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:32,266
with a doorknob on the inside of the door,
it's a good day

384
00:23:32,894 --> 00:23:35,554
Maybe someone else
didn't see it that way,

385
00:23:35,554 --> 00:23:38,348
came back angry,
wanting to settle a score?

386
00:23:38,348 --> 00:23:40,351
Everyone has a breaking point

387
00:23:40,351 --> 00:23:42,776
Carl reached his over there

388
00:23:42,776 --> 00:23:46,625
I didn't respect it but I understood

389
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,904
Hard to imagine all the POWs did

390
00:23:48,904 --> 00:23:50,353
We were like brothers, John,

391
00:23:50,353 --> 00:23:52,163
one of them went after Carl,
I would've know

392
00:23:52,163 --> 00:23:56,897
I'm talkin' about a lot of soldiers
and a guy they thought was a traitor

393
00:23:56,897 --> 00:24:01,366
We'd only been home a week
and all of us already knew

394
00:24:01,366 --> 00:24:05,675
Carl's worst punishment
was living with what he did

395
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:11,631
Rex's 51st bombing run

396
00:24:11,631 --> 00:24:14,305
He gets hit
Ejects

397
00:24:14,305 --> 00:24:16,499
Comes down outside Hanoi

398
00:24:16,499 --> 00:24:20,643
Spends a few hours hiding in a cave,
trying to get up enough strength to move

399
00:24:20,643 --> 00:24:25,770
But when he hears a North Vietnamese
patrol, he takes off on a broken leg,

400
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:30,067
with only his pistol
to hold off 20 guys chasing him

401
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:33,693
For hours Rex dragged himself along
just ahead of them

402
00:24:33,693 --> 00:24:37,951
Till he comes to this
hollowed out tree and squeezes in

403
00:24:37,951 --> 00:24:40,291
How dare you

404
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,159
I'm here to pay my respects

405
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:45,364
- How dare you sneak in here!
- Mom, stop it!

406
00:24:45,364 --> 00:24:47,856
You don't know what this man
did to your father, Daniel

407
00:24:47,856 --> 00:24:51,130
Let's calm down
We're here for Rex

408
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,977
Rex wouldn't want you here

409
00:24:52,977 --> 00:24:56,899
You betrayed him
Betrayed everyone

410
00:24:56,899 --> 00:24:59,974
You're a disgrace

411
00:24:59,974 --> 00:25:04,494
- Daddy?
- OK, Ned

412
00:25:06,858 --> 00:25:09,971
I'm sorry, Ruth

413
00:25:13,051 --> 00:25:15,251
Carl

414
00:25:15,835 --> 00:25:19,291
I think it's better
if you don't go to the reception / Yeah

415
00:25:19,291 --> 00:25:23,347
- I'll tell the guys that
- Tell them I died over there, Roger

416
00:25:23,347 --> 00:25:26,373
Tell them I'm already a ghost

417
00:25:33,439 --> 00:25:36,672
Guys who stuck it out,
resisted the most,

418
00:25:36,672 --> 00:25:38,216
did better when we got home

419
00:25:38,216 --> 00:25:41,424
The ones who gave in
had a tougher time / Yeah

420
00:25:41,424 --> 00:25:43,202
How bad do you think
it was for Carl?

421
00:25:43,202 --> 00:25:46,147
Bad enough I thought
he'd kill himself

422
00:25:46,147 --> 00:25:48,922
The gun was found
5 feet away from his body

423
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:52,419
You remember how long it takes
a man to die from a gut shot

424
00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:54,961
Might've crawled away after

425
00:25:54,961 --> 00:25:59,174
But who commits suicide
by shooting themselves in the stomach?

426
00:25:59,174 --> 00:26:04,491
Guy aiming for his heart
whose arms don't work anymore

427
00:26:12,186 --> 00:26:16,716
Could be my last cheesesteak
for a while / Oh, yeah?

428
00:26:16,716 --> 00:26:19,856
- Julie's talkin' about tofu
- Lieutenant

429
00:26:19,856 --> 00:26:21,141
Miller, how are you doing?

430
00:26:21,141 --> 00:26:22,717
Just dropped a guy in lock up

431
00:26:22,717 --> 00:26:24,726
How's the Burton case pannin' out?

432
00:26:24,726 --> 00:26:26,234
Nick Veera, this is Kat Miller,

433
00:26:26,234 --> 00:26:28,447
she's the one that turned up
the POW bracelets

434
00:26:28,447 --> 00:26:30,679
- Good work
- Thanks

435
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:32,028
So?

436
00:26:32,028 --> 00:26:34,999
Well the latest is,
Carl might have commited suicide

437
00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:38,456
A close fire would have left
lead residue on his clothes, right?

438
00:26:38,456 --> 00:26:40,608
Labs checkin'

439
00:26:40,608 --> 00:26:43,105
So, I hear you're doin' well
over in narcotics

440
00:26:43,105 --> 00:26:47,333
Oh, good I like it, so

441
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:51,218
Is that your long term
area of interest?

442
00:26:51,218 --> 00:26:53,127
I never thought I'd be a cop
in the first place

443
00:26:53,127 --> 00:26:56,054
so I'm game for whatever crops up

444
00:26:56,054 --> 00:26:58,500
I thought bein' in blue
was every girls' dream

445
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,963
You got somethin' else on mind?

446
00:26:59,963 --> 00:27:03,218
It's a long story
But, here I am

447
00:27:03,218 --> 00:27:06,183
- My options are open
- That's good to know

448
00:27:12,688 --> 00:27:16,610
Ken Westin copped
to takin' your dad's bracelets

449
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,828
Ken did?
Really?

450
00:27:18,828 --> 00:27:21,574
Dumb reaction
to your mom dropping him

451
00:27:21,574 --> 00:27:25,830
Does that maybe make
the drug scenario less likely? / Maybe

452
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:29,168
Ned, there was an incident
at Rex Potter's memorial

453
00:27:29,168 --> 00:27:32,248
- The day your father died
- Yeah, I remember it

454
00:27:32,248 --> 00:27:35,809
The rest of the POWs
took issue with your dad showing up

455
00:27:35,809 --> 00:27:39,205
We could see it in their faces
when we walked in They hated him

456
00:27:39,205 --> 00:27:41,825
Must've been pretty crushing
for him / Yeah

457
00:27:41,825 --> 00:27:43,936
One of those POWs thinks

458
00:27:43,936 --> 00:27:47,344
maybe he couldn't take it any longer

459
00:27:49,076 --> 00:27:52,236
You mean killed himself?

460
00:27:52,236 --> 00:27:54,110
However he died, Ned,

461
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,270
it ain't gonna change
what he was to you

462
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:59,873
I know a reason
why he might have killed himself

463
00:27:59,873 --> 00:28:03,884
Me
What I did

464
00:28:19,719 --> 00:28:21,507
Hey, buddy

465
00:28:21,507 --> 00:28:25,266
I know it's not fun
to be around people yelling like that

466
00:28:25,266 --> 00:28:27,531
It's OK

467
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,788
I love you

468
00:28:31,788 --> 00:28:34,665
Me, too, Daddy

469
00:28:34,665 --> 00:28:38,209
So you don't mind if I
eat all your ice cream?

470
00:28:38,209 --> 00:28:41,115
You could have your own

471
00:28:42,132 --> 00:28:46,589
- So, what can I get you guys?
- Bomb pop, please

472
00:28:46,589 --> 00:28:47,923
Hey, I remember you,

473
00:28:47,923 --> 00:28:50,084
you came in last summer
with your dad

474
00:28:50,084 --> 00:28:53,841
I'm his dad
Carl Burton, hi

475
00:28:53,841 --> 00:28:58,132
No, it was another man
A soldier

476
00:28:58,132 --> 00:29:00,050
He'd been over in
a Vietnam prison camp,

477
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,930
had some break
your heart stories about it

478
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:04,745
I was not here last summer,
I was

479
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:06,728
that was not me

480
00:29:06,728 --> 00:29:11,806
I'm sure it was this little boy
Who was that?

481
00:29:12,605 --> 00:29:16,086
Who was it, Ned?

482
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,672
Ken

483
00:29:19,672 --> 00:29:22,078
Ken was

484
00:29:22,078 --> 00:29:25,998
not a POW
Did he use my name?

485
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:32,451
Told this lady he was
your dad? / Yes

486
00:29:33,461 --> 00:29:39,652
And you let him
Why Ned?

487
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:42,512
I don't know

488
00:29:48,035 --> 00:29:51,870
So Ken's not just moving in on
Carl's wife while he's gone

489
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,817
He's pretending to be him

490
00:29:53,817 --> 00:29:56,528
I was with him a few times
when he did it

491
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:57,691
Didn't stop him

492
00:29:57,691 --> 00:29:58,862
You were 7

493
00:29:58,862 --> 00:30:01,224
But I knew it was wrong

494
00:30:01,224 --> 00:30:03,031
So after your dad found out?

495
00:30:03,031 --> 00:30:07,369
Marched me home, went down
to the basement for a while, then left

496
00:30:07,369 --> 00:30:11,195
- Where was your mom?
- Asleep

497
00:30:11,195 --> 00:30:13,804
Has been ever since

498
00:30:13,804 --> 00:30:16,014
Lab results are back

499
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:19,886
No traces of lead on Carl's clothes,
that rules out suicide

500
00:30:19,886 --> 00:30:22,007
So even if that was what
Carl was thinking that night,

501
00:30:22,007 --> 00:30:23,955
someone got to him first

502
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:25,063
If it's me,

503
00:30:25,063 --> 00:30:27,646
I'm heading' after the guy
posin' as my kid's dad

504
00:30:27,646 --> 00:30:31,466
Says here Carl was at
Rex Potter's funeral reception

505
00:30:31,466 --> 00:30:34,059
Even after Roger Raitt
told him not to show

506
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:36,115
Ken lived near the Potters,
knew them

507
00:30:36,115 --> 00:30:39,608
So maybe he's at the reception,
that's where Carl goes lookin' for him

508
00:30:39,608 --> 00:30:42,416
After Carl gets something
out of the basement, maybe a weapon,

509
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:44,331
he goes to confront Ken

510
00:30:44,331 --> 00:30:46,497
And never makes it back

511
00:30:47,785 --> 00:30:50,625
Westin spent four months
in Texas in '71,

512
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:52,279
waiting to be shipped out

513
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:56,513
Had a nervous breakdown
Discharged before he left US soil

514
00:30:56,513 --> 00:30:57,911
All right

515
00:30:57,911 --> 00:31:01,961
- You want us in there?
- I got it

516
00:31:05,478 --> 00:31:08,542
Sorry to pull you from work, Ken

517
00:31:09,293 --> 00:31:13,458
- I needed to talk to you
- Oh, sure

518
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:18,566
So, it sounds like Carl Burton was comin'
apart at the seams when he got back

519
00:31:18,566 --> 00:31:21,668
Yeah, he seemed to
have trouble adjusting

520
00:31:21,668 --> 00:31:23,529
It's tough to watch that

521
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:26,040
Guys over there snappin' out

522
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,843
Gotta go home, get out of here

523
00:31:28,843 --> 00:31:30,614
You can see they're never
gonna be the same

524
00:31:30,614 --> 00:31:32,933
- You know what I mean
- Oh, I do

525
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:36,254
Everybody going,
"crap, so-and-so lost it"

526
00:31:36,254 --> 00:31:40,189
But in the back of your mind,
you're thinking "I'm with him"

527
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:44,352
- In your weak moments
- You lay schemin' at night

528
00:31:44,352 --> 00:31:49,555
Come close to doin' some
crazy stuff, yeah

529
00:31:49,555 --> 00:31:52,811
So Carl turns up at this
funeral reception

530
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:54,830
where he's disinvited,
what was it like?

531
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,955
Antagonistic

532
00:31:56,955 --> 00:31:59,556
He's looking for trouble

533
00:31:59,556 --> 00:32:02,101
So you saw him the night he died?

534
00:32:02,101 --> 00:32:04,159
That's funny,
'cause you didn't tell us that,

535
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:11,437
you said you were at the bar
tossin' back a few when Carl was shot

536
00:32:11,437 --> 00:32:16,051
Yep
Went there after

537
00:32:16,051 --> 00:32:20,193
OK, then
So that was a lie you told us?

538
00:32:20,193 --> 00:32:21,996
Not intentionally

539
00:32:21,996 --> 00:32:23,752
It's been a long time

540
00:32:23,752 --> 00:32:26,837
Memory's middle aged now

541
00:32:26,837 --> 00:32:32,236
That's OK
It's a small time lie for you

542
00:32:41,638 --> 00:32:44,971
Does that bother you Ken?

543
00:32:44,971 --> 00:32:49,395
'Cause it doesn't seem
violent to me, I'm used to it

544
00:32:49,395 --> 00:32:53,428
Maybe because guns have been
a part of me since I was a kid

545
00:32:53,428 --> 00:32:57,303
I was 17 years old
when I went over there

546
00:32:57,303 --> 00:33:00,382
I thought it was a toy

547
00:33:00,382 --> 00:33:05,388
Until I watched a few men die slowly

548
00:33:05,388 --> 00:33:09,552
But you know what I'm
talking about

549
00:33:09,552 --> 00:33:12,833
What this does

550
00:33:15,762 --> 00:33:21,704
Not because you're a soldier,
because we know you weren't

551
00:33:21,704 --> 00:33:27,644
Ah, Lieutenant

552
00:33:30,828 --> 00:33:33,248
How long did Carl bleed?

553
00:33:33,248 --> 00:33:36,082
This is serious!

554
00:33:36,082 --> 00:33:40,510
How long did Carl bleed?

555
00:33:42,136 --> 00:33:46,142
I could never

556
00:33:46,142 --> 00:33:50,832
In extreme circumstances,
you learn about human nature

557
00:33:50,832 --> 00:33:57,258
But what kind of person
would pretend to be a POW?

558
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:00,250
I'd like a lawyer

559
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,942
Why?
What did you do?

560
00:34:01,942 --> 00:34:03,845
I didn't do anything to Carl

561
00:34:03,845 --> 00:34:07,814
Well you took what belonged to him
and walked around like it was yours

562
00:34:07,814 --> 00:34:11,966
Do you really think someone who had
a nervous breakdown at Fort Hood

563
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:16,674
would survive five years
in the Hanoi Hilton?

564
00:34:17,466 --> 00:34:19,481
It's a bad lie you told

565
00:34:19,481 --> 00:34:23,154
I know
I know

566
00:34:23,154 --> 00:34:25,610
I think I may have a disease

567
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:30,472
You tell people you're
a racecar driver, a brain surgeon

568
00:34:30,472 --> 00:34:34,624
Not a POW

569
00:34:38,825 --> 00:34:41,338
Now talk about that night

570
00:34:41,338 --> 00:34:44,506
Carl confronted you
at that reception / Yes

571
00:34:44,506 --> 00:34:47,683
And what did you do?

572
00:34:47,683 --> 00:34:49,936
Nothing

573
00:34:49,936 --> 00:34:52,691
Got called out

574
00:34:57,777 --> 00:35:00,241
I didn't have much time,
after I parachuted down

575
00:35:00,241 --> 00:35:03,896
I had to start my escape
on a busted leg

576
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,967
- I hear you wanna be me
- Excuse me?

577
00:35:06,967 --> 00:35:08,953
Well, might as well take these

578
00:35:08,953 --> 00:35:11,955
Use my name, my wife, my kid

579
00:35:11,955 --> 00:35:13,579
So now you got everything
that means a damn thing to me

580
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:17,011
Carl, this is akward

581
00:35:17,011 --> 00:35:20,103
You have something wrong with you,
you know that?

582
00:35:22,218 --> 00:35:25,347
Well that's the pot callin'
the kettle black

583
00:35:25,347 --> 00:35:27,469
- You're a fraud
- Daniel, I'm sorry

584
00:35:27,469 --> 00:35:30,523
Hey Carl, let's play a game

585
00:35:31,975 --> 00:35:37,254
This is a grenade
And you're you

586
00:35:38,823 --> 00:35:42,191
- Daniel
- Get away from me

587
00:35:59,709 --> 00:36:02,512
And that's how
you got the bracelets

588
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,600
A few minutes later,

589
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,225
Daniel left the house,

590
00:36:08,225 --> 00:36:10,934
went after Carl

591
00:36:12,562 --> 00:36:16,041
I told your detective
the kid was a problem

592
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:21,672
Yeah, well You're a real solid judge
of character, Ken

593
00:36:32,563 --> 00:36:34,656
We found out the truth that day,
huh, Daniel

594
00:36:34,656 --> 00:36:36,897
- What truth?
- About Carl

595
00:36:36,897 --> 00:36:38,635
Wasn't the guy you thought

596
00:36:38,635 --> 00:36:41,583
He was, underneath

597
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:43,924
Hearing about early release
didn't change that

598
00:36:43,924 --> 00:36:45,843
So why the big scene
at the reception?

599
00:36:45,843 --> 00:36:47,140
You were real keyed up

600
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,426
- Giving Carl what for
- Called him a fraud

601
00:36:49,426 --> 00:36:52,333
Look, Vietnam was complicated

602
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:53,603
The POWs are getting tortured

603
00:36:53,603 --> 00:36:57,457
and all they hear from America
is that this war's a mistake

604
00:36:57,457 --> 00:37:00,514
I get it
I get Carl throwing in the towel

605
00:37:00,514 --> 00:37:03,922
See, that's interesting
but that's what an adult thinks

606
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:06,797
Then what does a 15 year old
who just lost his dad think?

607
00:37:06,797 --> 00:37:09,466
That Carl abandoned
Rex Potter to die

608
00:37:09,466 --> 00:37:11,534
And he runs home
with his tail between his legs

609
00:37:11,534 --> 00:37:12,796
while your dad was still takin' it

610
00:37:12,796 --> 00:37:16,931
- Busted limbs, broken teeth
- Don't talk about my dad

611
00:37:19,753 --> 00:37:24,172
You don't know what
it was like for him

612
00:37:24,172 --> 00:37:27,022
But Carl did

613
00:37:27,022 --> 00:37:29,348
And he still left him there

614
00:37:29,348 --> 00:37:30,651
I got one letter from my dad

615
00:37:30,651 --> 00:37:33,625
but the government
blacked it out halfway

616
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:38,062
He took the time to write me
and they blacked it out

617
00:37:38,815 --> 00:37:42,771
I thought I could get
the black off

618
00:37:42,771 --> 00:37:45,902
I put it in water

619
00:37:47,735 --> 00:37:50,773
The only letter he sent

620
00:37:53,963 --> 00:37:57,582
I just wanted to know him

621
00:37:59,164 --> 00:38:02,934
He was gone a long time

622
00:38:02,934 --> 00:38:05,196
I thought that
Carl could help me

623
00:38:05,196 --> 00:38:08,646
Fill in the gap

624
00:38:08,646 --> 00:38:11,357
And he was right

625
00:38:12,813 --> 00:38:15,724
I didn't wanna know

626
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,509
You wanna just follow me
or do you wanna talk?

627
00:38:36,509 --> 00:38:38,941
I wanna ask you some things

628
00:38:39,461 --> 00:38:42,018
Are you stoned?

629
00:38:44,888 --> 00:38:46,865
Do not get into this

630
00:38:46,865 --> 00:38:49,806
- This is bad news
- Shut up

631
00:38:49,806 --> 00:38:53,525
This time we're talkin'
and you're gonna answer me for real

632
00:38:53,525 --> 00:38:57,542
After you left today the other POWs
told me that you gave up

633
00:38:57,542 --> 00:38:59,996
Said things you should be ashamed of
and then left my dad to die

634
00:38:59,996 --> 00:39:02,647
Is that true?

635
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:10,006
Is it true, Carl?

636
00:39:12,414 --> 00:39:15,915
I left the prison

637
00:39:15,915 --> 00:39:18,539
- And your dad was still there
- You left him,  all his friends said it

638
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:21,222
I didn't want
anything to happen to him

639
00:39:21,222 --> 00:39:23,929
But I had to go home

640
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:25,835
They played you on
a loudspeaker in prison

641
00:39:25,835 --> 00:39:28,578
and everyone heard you say
that the war was wrong

642
00:39:28,578 --> 00:39:31,239
You said they were war criminals
and that the Vietnamese saved you!

643
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:33,557
I said things I didn't mean
because I wanted to get home!

644
00:39:33,557 --> 00:39:35,672
Why?  Why couldn't you
do it like my dad?

645
00:39:35,672 --> 00:39:40,263
Because they broke me!
They chained us up

646
00:39:40,263 --> 00:39:43,148
They kicked our teeth in,
they killed our friends

647
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:46,396
That's what they did

648
00:39:48,591 --> 00:39:50,562
To my dad?

649
00:39:50,562 --> 00:39:53,233
To all of us

650
00:39:53,233 --> 00:39:55,533
And I couldn't do it one more day

651
00:39:55,533 --> 00:40:01,454
I wanted to see my wife,
my son

652
00:40:01,454 --> 00:40:03,562
You saying my dad
didn't want to see me?

653
00:40:03,562 --> 00:40:05,673
- Daniel, put that down
- Answer me!

654
00:40:05,673 --> 00:40:07,255
Daniel he was crazy about you!

655
00:40:07,255 --> 00:40:08,933
Why didn't he come home then?

656
00:40:08,933 --> 00:40:11,305
Because he wouldn't give in

657
00:40:11,305 --> 00:40:13,677
He was the toughest guy
I ever met

658
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:18,820
He could stick it out
and I couldn't

659
00:40:19,438 --> 00:40:22,640
What if they were breaking his arms
and kicking his teeth,

660
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,209
while he heard you saying that stuff
over the loudspeaker? / Daniel!

661
00:40:25,209 --> 00:40:30,718
he heard you say he was wrong!
And he wasn't! He wasn't!

662
00:40:36,428 --> 00:40:41,434
Carl, I think I hit you bad

663
00:40:43,263 --> 00:40:46,201
Go, don't be here, go!
It's OK!

664
00:40:46,201 --> 00:40:47,813
Carl, I didn't mean it!

665
00:40:47,813 --> 00:40:50,707
Go!
Run!

666
00:41:31,296 --> 00:41:38,771
* Gordon Lightfoot

671
00:41:55,121 --> 00:41:59,961

678
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:32,393
* Just like a paperback novel *

679
00:42:32,393 --> 00:42:36,110

680

* The hero would be me *

682
00:42:45,366 --> 00:42:49,163
* But heroes often fail *

683
00:42:49,163 --> 00:42:53,063
* And you won¡¯t read that book again *

684
00:42:53,063 --> 00:42:59,562

697
00:44:00,166 --> 00:44:03,388
* I don¡¯t know where we went wrong *

698
00:44:03,388 --> 00:44:05,524
* But the feelin¡¯s gone *

699
00:44:05,524 --> 00:44:11,119
* And I just can¡¯t get it back *
