1
00:00:33,425 --> 00:00:34,822
Congratulations, Jimmy.

2
00:00:34,822 --> 00:00:36,638
Hey, Mr. Wyatt, thanks.

3
00:00:36,638 --> 00:00:39,710
Even though you tanked my final,
you held onto your B.

4
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,272
Well, I've had a lot
of stuff on my mind.

5
00:00:42,272 --> 00:00:44,318
Math kind of took a backseat.

6
00:00:44,318 --> 00:00:45,791
Jimmy!

7
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,260
You haven't signed my yearbook yet.

8
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,850
- I'll do it later.
- I'm saving page 26 for you.

9
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:53,199
There's a candid of us
in chemistry lab.

10
00:00:54,297 --> 00:00:56,729
We have our goggles on,
but you can definitely tell it's us.

11
00:00:56,729 --> 00:00:58,764
Yeah? Cool.

12
00:00:58,764 --> 00:01:00,597
Hey, Jimmy, what do you say, huh?

13
00:01:00,597 --> 00:01:01,997
Coach.

14
00:01:01,997 --> 00:01:03,012
You look weird in a suit.

15
00:01:03,012 --> 00:01:05,301
Hey, tell me about it.
I feel like I'm at a funeral.

16
00:01:05,301 --> 00:01:08,149
And I am, in a way,
losing my star runner.

17
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:10,842
My loss, Villanova's gain, right?

18
00:01:10,842 --> 00:01:12,167
Excuse me, coach.

19
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:22,561
- Quinn.
- It's time.

20
00:03:27,603 --> 00:03:30,564
Hi. / Hi. You got a lighter?

21
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:32,779
Can't smoke in here.

22
00:03:35,386 --> 00:03:36,700
- Morning.
- Hey, Lil.

23
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,493
You know Lindsey Dunlay,
child services?

24
00:03:39,254 --> 00:03:40,714
Since tenth grade.

25
00:03:41,844 --> 00:03:43,132
Is she one of yours?

26
00:03:43,132 --> 00:03:45,077
Yeah. Claire Tate. 17.

27
00:03:45,077 --> 00:03:47,263
Knows everything,
hates everyone. Great kid.

28
00:03:47,263 --> 00:03:50,970
Her dad was killed in 1988.

29
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,593
Grad night. Adams high.

30
00:03:52,593 --> 00:03:54,757
- Was he a teacher?
- A student.

31
00:03:54,757 --> 00:03:56,024
His girlfriend was pregnant.

32
00:03:56,024 --> 00:03:57,294
Had the baby that night.

33
00:03:57,294 --> 00:03:59,223
Which, in the wisdom of teenagers,

34
00:03:59,223 --> 00:04:01,343
they left in a trash can.

35
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,427
Claire was that baby?

36
00:04:04,058 --> 00:04:06,072
Jimmy was hit by a car
that same night.

37
00:04:06,072 --> 00:04:07,089
They never found the driver.

38
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:08,153
We got new direction?

39
00:04:08,153 --> 00:04:10,475
Claire was approached by
a man yesterday,

40
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:12,279
talking about his murder.

41
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:13,943
Can I smoke on that balcony?

42
00:04:13,943 --> 00:04:16,043
Answer a few questions first.

43
00:04:16,574 --> 00:04:18,867
Can you describe
the guy you met, Claire?

44
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:21,131
He was old.
He drove a white van.

45
00:04:21,131 --> 00:04:23,584
Old like 30 or old like 60?

46
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:24,893
In between.

47
00:04:24,893 --> 00:04:26,719
And this was
at your school? / Yeah.

48
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:29,192
He pulls up, wants to talk to me.

49
00:04:29,192 --> 00:04:30,903
Says, "I know who killed Jimmy."

50
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,159
Meaning your dad.

51
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,411
But, when I said that,

52
00:04:33,411 --> 00:04:37,879
he says, "Jimmy wasn't
your dad. I was."

53
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:40,167
Did you get a name, Claire?
A license plate?

54
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:42,991
One of the teachers came out
and chased him away.

55
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:45,658
He was probably lying.

56
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:47,222
We'll find out.

57
00:04:47,222 --> 00:04:48,392
Can I go smoke now?

58
00:04:48,392 --> 00:04:49,534
You shouldn't.

59
00:04:49,534 --> 00:04:52,104
Who you gonna tell? My parents?

60
00:04:55,856 --> 00:04:57,389
Got an edge, huh? / Yeah.

61
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:59,980
17 years in foster care will do that.

62
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,510
We'll have uniforms in the area
watch out for a white van.

63
00:05:04,077 --> 00:05:05,674
There was one more thing.

64
00:05:05,674 --> 00:05:07,112
What's that?

65
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,080
Before he drove off,

66
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,392
he said he'd be coming back for me.

67
00:05:51,082 --> 00:05:52,498
Read about George's burial?

68
00:05:52,965 --> 00:05:54,636
No one there
but the grave diggers.

69
00:05:54,636 --> 00:05:57,083
Ask me, potter's field
is too good for his bones.

70
00:05:57,556 --> 00:05:59,638
So did you guys
hear about the parachuter?

71
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:01,505
No.

72
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:03,377
Sutton.

73
00:06:05,584 --> 00:06:07,134
You going to elaborate?

74
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:08,963
A girl, coming to homicide.

75
00:06:08,963 --> 00:06:11,224
Parachuting in from
northeast detectives.

76
00:06:11,224 --> 00:06:12,575
What's her inside drag?

77
00:06:12,575 --> 00:06:14,622
Dad was Tommy Sutton.
Died on the job.

78
00:06:14,622 --> 00:06:16,659
'81. Shot in a traffic stop.

79
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:18,846
Yeah. So who's goinna say no
to a fallen hero's daughter

80
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:20,239
wanting to come to homicide?

81
00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:22,404
Gil Sherman worked northeast.
Maybe he knows her.

82
00:06:22,404 --> 00:06:25,212
Already asked.
Said she's a looker.

83
00:06:26,362 --> 00:06:28,062
Can't hold that against her.

84
00:06:28,062 --> 00:06:29,791
You can if she throws it around.

85
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,740
Who says she does that?

86
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,869
Word I hear,

87
00:06:33,869 --> 00:06:36,344
some type of scandal
involving her sergeant.

88
00:06:37,123 --> 00:06:38,875
Sexual nature.

89
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,426
That's ill-advised.

90
00:06:41,426 --> 00:06:43,913
I got a sixth sense on this.

91
00:06:43,913 --> 00:06:45,719
This girl's gonna be trouble.

92
00:06:50,983 --> 00:06:55,731
Jimmy Tate, 18.
Graduated June 11, 1988

93
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:58,412
killed outside the school
that night. / Hit and run.

94
00:06:58,412 --> 00:07:00,896
Theory was some drunk kid did it,
never came forward.

95
00:07:00,896 --> 00:07:04,534
Jimmy's girlfriend, Quinn Ellis,
gave birth at the party that night,

96
00:07:04,534 --> 00:07:06,859
then left the baby in a trash bin.

97
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,796
Did two years for
reckless endangerment.

98
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:10,470
Lost custody, never bounced back.

99
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,466
She's been in and
out of trouble ever since.

100
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:14,631
Lives in a halfway house
in Fairmont.

101
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:15,921
Was she a suspect?

102
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:16,957
No license, no car.

103
00:07:16,957 --> 00:07:18,309
She was picked up
a few hours later

104
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:20,126
walking along the parkway in a daze.

105
00:07:20,126 --> 00:07:22,107
A partial tire impression
at the scene

106
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:24,784
was I.D'd as a Firestone,
new tread.

107
00:07:24,784 --> 00:07:27,000
A fairly common brand,
but it's something.

108
00:07:28,561 --> 00:07:32,136
So who's this guy coming around
now telling Claire he's her dad?

109
00:07:32,136 --> 00:07:34,631
Maybe just a crank.
Someone wants to mess with her mind.

110
00:07:34,631 --> 00:07:37,242
As if being thrown away
by her parents didn't do that.

111
00:07:48,164 --> 00:07:50,948
I do needlepoint
because I don't know how to knit.

112
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:52,943
Me neither.

113
00:07:52,943 --> 00:07:54,876
I'm not too good with skills.

114
00:07:54,876 --> 00:07:57,569
So, Quinn, we're looking back
into Jimmy's hit-and-run.

115
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:01,994
That night just about sunk me.

116
00:08:01,994 --> 00:08:03,305
Losing Jimmy?

117
00:08:03,305 --> 00:08:04,439
And the baby.

118
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:06,099
Yeah, but losing her was voluntary.

119
00:08:06,784 --> 00:08:08,351
It was a bad decision.

120
00:08:10,068 --> 00:08:11,339
Tell us about it.

121
00:08:12,616 --> 00:08:16,578
Well, I had her in a stall
in the girl's bathroom.

122
00:08:16,578 --> 00:08:17,960
Tough place to give birth?

123
00:08:18,803 --> 00:08:21,213
You know what though?
It wasn't too bad.

124
00:08:22,155 --> 00:08:25,718
It wasn't easy or anything,
but I handled it.

125
00:08:25,718 --> 00:08:27,776
So why ditch her in the trash?

126
00:08:27,776 --> 00:08:31,999
I was 18 and dumb.

127
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,938
Just couldn't think
of anything else right then.

128
00:08:34,938 --> 00:08:36,356
And Jimmy was?

129
00:08:36,356 --> 00:08:39,405
Gone. Right after she was born.

130
00:08:39,856 --> 00:08:43,951
Quinn, Claire was approached yesterday
by a guy that claimed he's her dad.

131
00:08:44,506 --> 00:08:46,230
That's crazy.

132
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:49,121
That's mean and crazy.

133
00:08:49,121 --> 00:08:51,223
Anyone you can think of
would say that? / No.

134
00:08:51,978 --> 00:08:54,185
Jimmy was my one and only.

135
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:57,137
To this day, he was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

136
00:08:58,053 --> 00:08:59,741
So how did it go wrong?

137
00:09:00,646 --> 00:09:03,094
Getting pregnant messed us up.

138
00:09:06,157 --> 00:09:09,441
Sine, opposite over hypotenuse.

139
00:09:10,191 --> 00:09:13,946
Cosine, adjacent over hypotenuse.

140
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,995
Can you meet me tonight?

141
00:09:17,481 --> 00:09:19,799
No. My parents.

142
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:22,280
Jimmy! Quinn!

143
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,881
My way or the hallway.

144
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:38,192
Dork, huh?

145
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:42,937
Hey, what's wrong?

146
00:09:42,937 --> 00:09:46,720
Nothing. / Don't tell me nothing.
You're crying.

147
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,351
I'm scared you'll
hate me. / Quinn.

148
00:09:53,454 --> 00:09:56,814
You know how I haven't
been feeling that good?

149
00:09:58,336 --> 00:10:01,211
Well, it turns out
I'm pregnant.

150
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:09,647
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

151
00:10:09,647 --> 00:10:11,293
Did you take one of those...

152
00:10:11,293 --> 00:10:13,942
Home tests?
Yeah.

153
00:10:15,342 --> 00:10:16,946
It was blue.

154
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:19,212
It was just that one weekend.

155
00:10:22,057 --> 00:10:23,520
We need to fix it.

156
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:26,244
Yeah.

157
00:10:27,784 --> 00:10:29,441
We'll take care of it.

158
00:10:38,135 --> 00:10:41,392
But we didn't really
take care of it.

159
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:46,259
Time got away from us
and we had her.

160
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:50,004
How about leaving her
at a hospital? A church?

161
00:10:50,789 --> 00:10:52,421
That would have been better.

162
00:11:07,227 --> 00:11:10,530
Yeah, I found that baby.
It was a head trip.

163
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:14,184
So how did you happen to be
looking in the trash that night?

164
00:11:14,184 --> 00:11:16,947
I was drunk,
weaving down the hall,

165
00:11:16,947 --> 00:11:19,869
and there was this cry
from the closet.

166
00:11:19,869 --> 00:11:22,240
I thought I was hearing things.

167
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,485
But, no, it was a real live baby.

168
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:26,852
See anyone around?

169
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,640
I ran back to the party,
told everyone.

170
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,379
Got around real quick
it was Jimmy and Quinn's.

171
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:35,082
Did people know Quinn
was pregnant? / No.

172
00:11:35,082 --> 00:11:36,926
Well, most people, anyway.

173
00:11:36,926 --> 00:11:38,453
But you did?

174
00:11:38,453 --> 00:11:43,321
Well, I happened to be in the nurse's
office one day when Jimmy came in.

175
00:11:49,859 --> 00:11:51,187
Jimmy.

176
00:11:54,998 --> 00:11:58,779
- That ankle acting up?
- Oh, no. It's better.

177
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:00,600
So what can I do for you?

178
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,259
Well, um...

179
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:05,414
I'm in a situation with my girlfriend.

180
00:12:05,414 --> 00:12:07,053
Yes?

181
00:12:07,053 --> 00:12:08,915
She's, uh...

182
00:12:08,915 --> 00:12:11,135
you know, pregnant.

183
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:15,605
I borrowed some money, $200.

184
00:12:15,605 --> 00:12:19,506
We want to take care of it.

185
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:22,615
I just don't know where to go.

186
00:12:24,271 --> 00:12:26,425
I see.

187
00:12:26,425 --> 00:12:29,722
Well, first of all,

188
00:12:29,722 --> 00:12:32,645
it costs more like $900.

189
00:12:34,774 --> 00:12:37,187
And you'd both need parental consent.

190
00:12:37,187 --> 00:12:39,171
We can't.

191
00:12:39,171 --> 00:12:41,298
And...

192
00:12:42,091 --> 00:12:46,364
you know, Quinn would never
be able to have children again. / No. I...

193
00:12:46,364 --> 00:12:47,749
I didn't know that.

194
00:12:47,749 --> 00:12:49,991
I have some photos you should see.

195
00:13:00,917 --> 00:13:05,887
Can you imagine having
your legs and arms broken,

196
00:13:06,593 --> 00:13:08,355
and then suctioned away?

197
00:13:09,472 --> 00:13:11,766
Huh? / You'd probably scream,

198
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:15,028
just like the babies do.

199
00:13:19,197 --> 00:13:20,820
I thought if...

200
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,195
it was early, it was easy.

201
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,738
Murder isn't easy.

202
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,498
Well...

203
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:34,632
I guess...

204
00:13:36,813 --> 00:13:38,389
Thanks, nurse Laura.

205
00:13:43,212 --> 00:13:45,412
So this nurse had an agenda.

206
00:13:45,822 --> 00:13:47,044
Nut job.

207
00:13:47,987 --> 00:13:49,494
Jimmy come from money?

208
00:13:50,073 --> 00:13:54,330
His dad left them early.
Mom was a sometimes waitress.

209
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,115
So how do you figure
he got the 200 bucks?

210
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,055
He was on the track team,

211
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:03,926
had kind of an extra close
relationship with the coach.

212
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:05,689
You got a name?

213
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,199
Bruce...

214
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,877
something.

215
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:14,183
You know, I could find it
in my yearbook.

216
00:14:14,695 --> 00:14:16,143
Call you.

217
00:14:18,496 --> 00:14:22,396
It turns out this school nurse
was big into operation choose life in '88.

218
00:14:22,396 --> 00:14:23,673
And built up a sheet doing it.

219
00:14:23,673 --> 00:14:25,048
Laura Graham, three arrests.

220
00:14:25,048 --> 00:14:27,426
'86, assaulted a patient
going into a clinic.

221
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:29,697
Same year, broke windows
at a doctor's office.

222
00:14:29,697 --> 00:14:31,436
Strange extracurriculars
for a school nurse.

223
00:14:31,436 --> 00:14:34,814
And my personal favorite,
1987, ran a doctor off the road

224
00:14:34,814 --> 00:14:37,083
after his shift at
a woman's health center.

225
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,702
In her caddy Cimarron.

226
00:14:39,376 --> 00:14:40,829
Firestone tires?

227
00:14:41,641 --> 00:14:43,241
Just like the car that killed Jimmy.

228
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:53,619
Lieutenant Stillman?

229
00:14:54,337 --> 00:14:55,347
I'm Josie Sutton.

230
00:14:56,086 --> 00:14:57,830
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

231
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,073
I'm really glad to be here.

232
00:15:00,175 --> 00:15:03,315
I knew your dad.
I was at his funeral.

233
00:15:04,205 --> 00:15:07,390
All I remember about the funeral
were the gunshots.

234
00:15:07,925 --> 00:15:09,355
They scared me, and...

235
00:15:10,087 --> 00:15:12,498
in retrospect,
seem kind of inappropriate.

236
00:15:14,097 --> 00:15:15,145
Sit down.

237
00:15:21,282 --> 00:15:22,971
How'd you like it at northeast?

238
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,422
It was fine.

239
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,810
Look, I'm sure
you know the rumors

240
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:33,136
going around about sergeant
White and you. / Yeah.

241
00:15:33,136 --> 00:15:36,409
Now, I don't need
to know what happened. / No.

242
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:38,083
I just don't want trouble here.

243
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,181
Me neither.

244
00:15:40,098 --> 00:15:41,320
Fair enough.

245
00:15:42,655 --> 00:15:43,759
Hey, boss.

246
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,191
Scotty Valens.
Detective Sutton.

247
00:15:46,191 --> 00:15:47,463
Hi. Josie.

248
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:49,901
Uh, from northeast? / Yeah.

249
00:15:49,901 --> 00:15:52,887
Yeah, we heard you
were coming. / Uh...

250
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:55,398
- congratulations.
- Thanks.

251
00:15:55,398 --> 00:15:56,896
Did you find that track coach?

252
00:15:56,896 --> 00:15:59,695
Wasn't at his last known.
Guess his wife tossed him.

253
00:15:59,695 --> 00:16:01,027
Going to his workplace now.

254
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:03,045
Why don't you take
Sutton with you?

255
00:16:04,786 --> 00:16:07,294
Yeah.
Sure.

256
00:16:11,911 --> 00:16:14,545
So two scared kids want to end
their pregnancy,

257
00:16:14,545 --> 00:16:16,360
but you had other plans for them.

258
00:16:17,171 --> 00:16:18,832
I counseled Jimmy.

259
00:16:18,832 --> 00:16:21,217
No, you lied to him.

260
00:16:21,217 --> 00:16:22,446
You showed him gruesome photos.

261
00:16:22,446 --> 00:16:24,921
I thought he should see what
they do at the killing mills.

262
00:16:24,921 --> 00:16:27,000
Oh, bite me.

263
00:16:27,511 --> 00:16:29,303
We hear Quinn never
looked pregnant.

264
00:16:29,303 --> 00:16:32,441
So, maybe, by June, you thought
they'd gone against your advice. / No.

265
00:16:32,441 --> 00:16:34,352
Maybe now you wanted
to punish Jimmy?

266
00:16:34,352 --> 00:16:36,504
And we know your cadillac's
your weapon of choice.

267
00:16:37,482 --> 00:16:39,296
I got through to Jimmy.

268
00:16:39,296 --> 00:16:42,429
Right after the holidays, he asked
for the name of an obstetrician.

269
00:16:43,401 --> 00:16:46,816
So, you see, there was
no need for punishment.

270
00:16:49,003 --> 00:16:50,061
Excuse me.

271
00:16:54,574 --> 00:16:58,121
Claire, don't you
have school right now?

272
00:16:58,121 --> 00:17:00,233
Just American history.
Who cares?

273
00:17:00,233 --> 00:17:01,785
You want your diploma, Claire.

274
00:17:01,785 --> 00:17:03,112
I don't like school.

275
00:17:05,797 --> 00:17:07,208
So why are you here?

276
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,418
He came back.

277
00:17:08,932 --> 00:17:10,195
The guy in the van?

278
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,800
Yeah, asked me to go with him.

279
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,163
You get a good look this time?

280
00:17:13,653 --> 00:17:15,849
Yeah. We talked.

281
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:17,595
Said we should have dinner,
father-daughter.

282
00:17:17,595 --> 00:17:19,096
Claire, he could be dangerous.

283
00:17:19,096 --> 00:17:21,102
- He was nice.
- Well, I need to talk to him.

284
00:17:21,102 --> 00:17:22,601
Did you get a name? / No.

285
00:17:25,974 --> 00:17:30,286
Look, I saw your mom
yesterday. / So?

286
00:17:33,457 --> 00:17:34,952
She asked about you.

287
00:17:35,908 --> 00:17:37,363
Why do I care?

288
00:17:38,455 --> 00:17:40,552
She'd like to see you.

289
00:17:40,552 --> 00:17:41,906
No, thanks.

290
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:51,997
Bruce Johnson.

291
00:17:52,547 --> 00:17:54,582
Yeah? / We're here
to talk about Jimmy Tate.

292
00:17:55,055 --> 00:17:57,775
Jimmy Tate?
Great kid, personality plus.

293
00:17:57,775 --> 00:17:59,655
We hear you were kind of
a father figure to him.

294
00:17:59,655 --> 00:18:01,119
Yeah. Yeah, I was.

295
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,145
He didn't have a real dad,

296
00:18:02,145 --> 00:18:03,650
and his mom didn't exactly
pick up the slack.

297
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:04,845
Something wrong with her?

298
00:18:04,845 --> 00:18:06,827
Nice lady. Just couldn't
handle the basics,

299
00:18:06,827 --> 00:18:08,770
you know?
Wounded bird type.

300
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,274
So when Jimmy got
into trouble with Quinn...

301
00:18:10,274 --> 00:18:11,831
Another wounded bird.

302
00:18:11,831 --> 00:18:13,985
You gave him the 200 bucks
for the abortion?

303
00:18:13,985 --> 00:18:16,965
Yeah. I didn't want to see him
throw his life away.

304
00:18:16,965 --> 00:18:18,468
Obviously, he disagreed.

305
00:18:18,468 --> 00:18:19,936
Why do you say that?

306
00:18:20,446 --> 00:18:22,892
Because he returned the money.

307
00:18:23,444 --> 00:18:25,186
Because now they were
gonna keep the baby?

308
00:18:25,186 --> 00:18:26,831
Never mind a future in track,

309
00:18:26,831 --> 00:18:28,082
a free ride to Villanova,

310
00:18:28,082 --> 00:18:30,541
he figured let me get married
at 18 instead.

311
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,663
I'm guessing you tried
to talk him out of it.

312
00:18:32,663 --> 00:18:37,211
Yeah, it fell to me to show him
the light about the girl.

313
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,893
Keep the money.
Don't be crazy.

314
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:46,820
We're gonna have it.

315
00:18:47,745 --> 00:18:49,774
Jimmy, that's a big mistake.

316
00:18:49,774 --> 00:18:51,959
No. We'll be a family.

317
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:54,910
Earlier than I ever thought but...

318
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,741
What about the track scholarship?

319
00:18:57,989 --> 00:18:59,421
Maybe in a year or two...

320
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:01,168
Won't happen.
Your time is now.

321
00:19:01,168 --> 00:19:03,329
I have to think of Quinn.

322
00:19:03,329 --> 00:19:05,710
Look, kid...

323
00:19:06,869 --> 00:19:09,622
I hate to say this but, uh,

324
00:19:09,622 --> 00:19:12,567
are you sure it's yours? / Huh?

325
00:19:14,213 --> 00:19:15,720
I've seen her with other guys,

326
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:18,437
when you're not around.

327
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:22,386
Talking, maybe. / No.

328
00:19:23,317 --> 00:19:24,857
Not just talking.

329
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:31,883
I'm sorry.

330
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,853
But maybe it's not
your mistake at all.

331
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:40,383
So Quinn had other boyfriends?

332
00:19:41,554 --> 00:19:43,735
I don't know if
I'd call them boyfriends.

333
00:19:43,735 --> 00:19:45,030
She made the rounds.

334
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:48,159
Was this something you knew
or just your opinion?

335
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:50,209
She was oversexed, okay?

336
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:51,481
But how do you know?

337
00:19:52,081 --> 00:19:54,146
Some girls just put it on the glass.

338
00:19:55,338 --> 00:19:59,600
And you think this is relevant somehow
to Jimmy getting killed? / Yeah, I do.

339
00:20:00,635 --> 00:20:02,848
Because what if he
wised up, huh?

340
00:20:02,848 --> 00:20:04,439
What if he told Quinn to beat it?

341
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:06,544
And what if, in a female rage,

342
00:20:06,544 --> 00:20:08,498
with a baby and no man,

343
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,264
she just went out
and mowed Jimmy down?

344
00:20:15,724 --> 00:20:17,883
Jimmy was your one
and only, huh, Quinn?

345
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,069
Like I said.

346
00:20:19,069 --> 00:20:20,945
That ain't what I'm hearing
from his old coach.

347
00:20:21,697 --> 00:20:23,031
Why are you talking to him?

348
00:20:23,031 --> 00:20:24,185
Quinn, I'm busy,

349
00:20:24,185 --> 00:20:25,864
and you're wasting my time!

350
00:20:25,864 --> 00:20:27,178
I don't know what you mean.

351
00:20:27,178 --> 00:20:29,385
I mean if you had
multiple boyfriends,

352
00:20:29,385 --> 00:20:30,676
I got multiple suspects.

353
00:20:30,676 --> 00:20:31,513
I didn't.

354
00:20:31,513 --> 00:20:33,584
No? The coach is making that up?

355
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:38,903
Hey, Quinn...

356
00:20:38,903 --> 00:20:42,063
your daughter is being stalked
by some freak who says he's her dad.

357
00:20:42,063 --> 00:20:44,090
Now I know you didn't give
a crap about her
when you were 18,

358
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,874
because you wanted
your young, fun life,

359
00:20:45,874 --> 00:20:47,550
and a crying baby's
a real buzz kill.

360
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,795
- That's mean.
- But you were 18 then.

361
00:20:49,795 --> 00:20:51,871
How about being an adult now,

362
00:20:51,871 --> 00:20:52,972
and owning up?

363
00:20:55,308 --> 00:20:56,751
What do you want to know?

364
00:20:56,751 --> 00:20:58,813
Were there other guys?

365
00:20:59,652 --> 00:21:00,752
One.

366
00:21:10,495 --> 00:21:11,668
How'd you get out of swimming?

367
00:21:13,048 --> 00:21:14,769
I said I had my period.

368
00:21:15,386 --> 00:21:16,685
We wish.

369
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,932
I didn't want this either, Jimmy.

370
00:21:21,485 --> 00:21:25,556
I know, I know. I...
I was just joking.

371
00:21:26,462 --> 00:21:28,762
I thought we were gonna
be happy about it.

372
00:21:29,942 --> 00:21:31,228
We are.

373
00:21:33,468 --> 00:21:34,731
I'm just...

374
00:21:35,363 --> 00:21:36,689
hearing things.

375
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:38,991
Like what?

376
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:42,741
Maybe I'm not your only guy.

377
00:21:43,576 --> 00:21:45,663
- Who said that?
- Coach Johnson.

378
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:49,589
Coach Johnson's a jerk.

379
00:21:49,589 --> 00:21:51,370
He's a teacher.
He wouldn't lie.

380
00:21:57,533 --> 00:22:00,054
I went to the locker room
one time.

381
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,673
And he was in the office.

382
00:22:08,344 --> 00:22:11,769
He said he, he liked me, and...

383
00:22:12,724 --> 00:22:16,066
that I was pretty,
and he started touching me.

384
00:22:17,939 --> 00:22:20,873
I just, I just kind of froze, Jimmy.

385
00:22:21,816 --> 00:22:23,564
No.

386
00:22:24,244 --> 00:22:26,021
No!

387
00:22:26,492 --> 00:22:28,284
It was over really quick.

388
00:22:28,284 --> 00:22:29,749
I don't believe this.

389
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,012
I couldn't either.

390
00:22:32,012 --> 00:22:33,636
I don't believe you!

391
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:36,794
It's true.

392
00:22:38,377 --> 00:22:39,695
I...

393
00:22:40,689 --> 00:22:42,787
I don't think we
can be together anymore.

394
00:22:43,838 --> 00:22:45,124
Jimmy.

395
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,521
If I can't trust you...

396
00:22:47,521 --> 00:22:49,021
But I didn't want to.

397
00:22:49,934 --> 00:22:51,150
It's over.

398
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:56,847
God, what about the baby?

399
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:02,575
I'll think of something.

400
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,985
So he broke it off?

401
00:23:17,128 --> 00:23:20,604
We weren't gonna raise
the baby together anymore.

402
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:23,078
What were you gonna do?

403
00:23:24,422 --> 00:23:26,209
Jimmy came up with another plan.

404
00:23:26,715 --> 00:23:28,279
Found someone to take her.

405
00:23:29,262 --> 00:23:30,389
Who?

406
00:23:31,027 --> 00:23:32,190
I don't know.

407
00:23:33,628 --> 00:23:37,398
That night in the bathroom,
he just said "it's all over,"

408
00:23:37,398 --> 00:23:39,070
and went to get them.

409
00:23:41,154 --> 00:23:43,989
You sure you didn't
go looking for Jimmy? / No.

410
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:48,659
Because Jimmy bailing like that
could be seen as motive.

411
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:51,950
Jimmy dying ruined my life.

412
00:23:53,722 --> 00:23:55,984
Why would I do that to myself?

413
00:23:59,514 --> 00:24:01,553
There's a lot of people
ruin their lives.

414
00:24:06,837 --> 00:24:09,584
Looked through the records
at Dr. Sterling's office.

415
00:24:09,584 --> 00:24:11,572
The doctor nurse Laura recommended?

416
00:24:11,572 --> 00:24:14,895
Jimmy and Quinn went to see him
March 14, '88.

417
00:24:15,523 --> 00:24:16,765
That help us?

418
00:24:16,765 --> 00:24:17,626
Keep reading.

419
00:24:17,626 --> 00:24:19,564
An adult had to accompany them,
since they were minors.

420
00:24:19,564 --> 00:24:21,036
Guess whose signature
is on the chart?

421
00:24:21,036 --> 00:24:22,694
Nurse Laura's.

422
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:25,181
Jered Wyatt, their math teacher.

423
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:28,993
Worth a conversation. / Lil?

424
00:24:30,186 --> 00:24:31,167
Hey, Lindsey.

425
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:34,241
Claire's school called.
She disappeared this afternoon.

426
00:24:34,241 --> 00:24:35,387
What do you mean, disappeared?

427
00:24:35,387 --> 00:24:38,099
She was abducted
outside the school.

428
00:24:40,598 --> 00:24:42,204
The guy in the white van.

429
00:24:56,367 --> 00:24:58,556
Guess who ain't answering
his phone all of a sudden?

430
00:24:59,092 --> 00:25:00,342
The track coach.

431
00:25:00,342 --> 00:25:02,287
Plus he owns a white Dodge van.

432
00:25:02,287 --> 00:25:04,010
Guy had an unnatural
interest in Quinn,

433
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,404
maybe now he's got
it for the kid.

434
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,944
- Hey, I'm Jo Sutton.
- Yeah.

435
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,999
Uh, Lilly Rush. / Hi.

436
00:25:12,999 --> 00:25:15,048
I was getting tired of being
the only girl on the line.

437
00:25:15,048 --> 00:25:17,376
Hey, Vera.
We know this dude.

438
00:25:21,558 --> 00:25:22,635
Timmy!

439
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,628
- Where's your windex?
- Oh, yeah. You guys.

440
00:25:27,355 --> 00:25:29,461
You seen that white van
everyone's talking about?

441
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,483
I don't, uh, get involved.

442
00:25:31,483 --> 00:25:32,895
How about some beer?

443
00:25:32,895 --> 00:25:34,146
What brand?

444
00:25:34,738 --> 00:25:36,687
You choose. Live it up.

445
00:25:36,687 --> 00:25:39,604
Well, yeah, I seen it.
Uh, drove alongside this girl walking.

446
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:40,545
When was that?

447
00:25:41,677 --> 00:25:45,138
I'd just be guessing,
because I don't really keep up with time.

448
00:25:46,308 --> 00:25:47,456
Was this guy driving?

449
00:25:47,456 --> 00:25:49,087
That's the mug of the man. Yeah.

450
00:25:49,087 --> 00:25:50,184
He force the girl in?

451
00:25:50,184 --> 00:25:52,029
Oh, no, chief.
She got in herself.

452
00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:53,426
What, like, willingly?

453
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:54,809
Yeah, feet up on the dash.

454
00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:57,586
Going for a nice spin. Voluntary.

455
00:26:04,552 --> 00:26:05,602
Jered Wyatt?

456
00:26:07,342 --> 00:26:08,589
Lieutenant Stillman.

457
00:26:08,589 --> 00:26:10,527
I have to teach a night
class in an hour.

458
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:11,473
We just want to get to the bottom

459
00:26:11,473 --> 00:26:14,279
of your name being on this
doctor's form, Mr. Wyatt.

460
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:18,187
Um...

461
00:26:18,187 --> 00:26:21,520
I helped out Jimmy and Quinn
because they were nice kids.

462
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,120
- That all?
- That's all.

463
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,843
Well, taking an interest is one thing,

464
00:26:24,843 --> 00:26:27,455
but acting as their guardian
during a sonogram?

465
00:26:32,192 --> 00:26:34,815
- Can I be frank?
- Please.

466
00:26:36,389 --> 00:26:39,132
I was...
married.

467
00:26:39,132 --> 00:26:42,113
And? / And I wanted to stay that way.

468
00:26:42,942 --> 00:26:45,289
And, well...

469
00:26:45,289 --> 00:26:47,834
Jimmy had something over me.

470
00:26:58,519 --> 00:26:59,647
Mr. Wyatt, I...

471
00:27:00,858 --> 00:27:02,576
- Whoa.
- Oh, my god.

472
00:27:02,576 --> 00:27:03,820
Nurse Laura?

473
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,259
Hey, Jimmy.

474
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:06,513
Do something, Jered.

475
00:27:06,513 --> 00:27:07,807
Ho, ho, hold on a second.

476
00:27:07,807 --> 00:27:08,873
Jimmy?

477
00:27:08,873 --> 00:27:11,187
Jimmy! Hey, hey.

478
00:27:11,682 --> 00:27:13,870
Take it easy, okay?

479
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,351
I'm not gonna say
anything. / It's...

480
00:27:16,656 --> 00:27:21,109
Jimmy, I have
a fragile home situation.

481
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:23,287
- Yeah, sure.
- No, no, no.

482
00:27:24,832 --> 00:27:26,080
This is important.

483
00:27:30,633 --> 00:27:32,880
You do me a good turn here,
I'll do you one.

484
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,165
What do you mean?

485
00:27:34,165 --> 00:27:37,816
I know about Quinn.
Your problem.

486
00:27:38,396 --> 00:27:40,615
I want to help, if I can.

487
00:27:41,343 --> 00:27:42,771
We're fine.

488
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:47,140
Hey.
Hey, you can talk to me.

489
00:27:48,898 --> 00:27:50,564
We broke up, but...

490
00:27:51,718 --> 00:27:53,481
We still have the baby coming.

491
00:27:56,296 --> 00:27:57,743
Can I help at all?

492
00:27:58,984 --> 00:28:02,609
There is something we need
for this appointment.

493
00:28:06,369 --> 00:28:07,920
I took them to the doctor.

494
00:28:09,002 --> 00:28:10,917
Now we both knew
each other's secrets.

495
00:28:11,749 --> 00:28:13,005
Insurance.

496
00:28:14,547 --> 00:28:16,828
And what'd Laura do for insurance?

497
00:28:18,402 --> 00:28:19,668
I don't know.

498
00:28:21,018 --> 00:28:23,961
But boy, she pitched a fit
after Jimmy walked in on us.

499
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,399
I'm talking warpath.

500
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:36,578
Oh, you play like you're all
virtue and piety, don't you, Laura?

501
00:28:36,578 --> 00:28:38,815
But the truth is, uh...

502
00:28:38,815 --> 00:28:39,974
not so much.

503
00:28:40,568 --> 00:28:42,197
If you're asking if I was...

504
00:28:42,732 --> 00:28:45,594
compromised with Jered Wyatt,
yes, I was.

505
00:28:45,594 --> 00:28:47,821
And Jimmy was witness to this.

506
00:28:47,821 --> 00:28:49,159
That's also true.

507
00:28:49,671 --> 00:28:51,551
That couldn't have sat well.

508
00:28:51,551 --> 00:28:53,218
You had a reputation to uphold.

509
00:28:53,218 --> 00:28:55,101
And a job to keep. / Look...

510
00:28:56,815 --> 00:28:59,524
I know something that
could probably be helpful.

511
00:29:01,046 --> 00:29:02,756
Talk to Angie Parrington.

512
00:29:03,594 --> 00:29:06,176
- The girl who found the baby?
- She was in my office every day.

513
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,318
I had to watch her
take her medication.

514
00:29:08,318 --> 00:29:11,637
- What kind of meds?
- Antipsychotics.

515
00:29:13,312 --> 00:29:14,608
What's that got to do with Jimmy?

516
00:29:14,608 --> 00:29:17,833
She was obsessed with him,
talked about him nonstop.

517
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:20,750
So Angie's troubled.
Okay, but...

518
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,529
why would she suddenly snap?

519
00:29:23,247 --> 00:29:25,995
Because she went off her meds
for graduation.

520
00:29:31,629 --> 00:29:34,505
- You didn't come today, Angie.
- No, I didn't.

521
00:29:34,505 --> 00:29:36,561
It's been three days.
I'm not taking that poison anymore,

522
00:29:36,561 --> 00:29:38,506
and I just graduated,
so you can't make me.

523
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:44,674
Jimmy!

524
00:29:44,674 --> 00:29:46,190
Uh, I know, I gotta sign your book.

525
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,752
No, it's not about that.
It's something else,

526
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:50,310
- and I know you're gonna like it.
- Could I find you later?

527
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,953
No, Jimmy, I have something for you.

528
00:29:51,953 --> 00:29:53,520
Quinn needs me right now.

529
00:29:54,198 --> 00:29:56,378
I don't know why you
still like Quinn. / Angie...

530
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:58,059
Because she's like nothing.
She's like a background girl.

531
00:29:58,059 --> 00:30:00,222
No she's not.
She's shy, but...

532
00:30:01,282 --> 00:30:02,728
You don't know her.

533
00:30:03,167 --> 00:30:04,850
Yeah, well, I think she's fat.

534
00:30:06,601 --> 00:30:09,125
Jimmy! I'm gonna find you.

535
00:30:11,033 --> 00:30:14,176
So Angie's pretty determined
to get Jimmy alone.

536
00:30:14,176 --> 00:30:16,835
And she was the kind of girl
who got what she wanted.

537
00:30:16,835 --> 00:30:18,560
You think she was
capable of violence?

538
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,215
She quit her meds once before,
her sophomore year.

539
00:30:22,706 --> 00:30:25,715
Lit a cheerleader's
hair on fire at a pep rally.

540
00:30:30,517 --> 00:30:33,177
I hear my girl Angie
was kind of nutso?

541
00:30:33,716 --> 00:30:35,212
I'm sorry, man.

542
00:30:35,212 --> 00:30:37,073
Easy come, easy go.

543
00:30:38,011 --> 00:30:39,930
So has this one pulled anything yet?

544
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:47,100
Uh, no.
Not really.

545
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,602
Give her time.

546
00:30:49,613 --> 00:30:52,879
Claire sent a note
to her foster parents. / Yeah?

547
00:30:52,879 --> 00:30:54,388
She doesn't want to be found.

548
00:30:55,118 --> 00:30:57,705
"Don't worry about me.
I'm with my dad."

549
00:30:57,705 --> 00:31:01,619
Lieutenant, um, I've been going over
new car purchases from June '88.

550
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:05,354
You have? / New tread
on the tires, new car...

551
00:31:05,354 --> 00:31:07,388
That's needle-in-a-haystack territory.

552
00:31:07,946 --> 00:31:09,681
But I found something.

553
00:31:09,681 --> 00:31:12,022
One of the buyers
was Angie Parrington.

554
00:31:12,597 --> 00:31:14,144
My Angie who found the baby?

555
00:31:14,144 --> 00:31:16,024
And who was pining for Jimmy.

556
00:31:16,024 --> 00:31:18,367
Bought a corvette on June 10th.

557
00:31:18,367 --> 00:31:20,391
The day before Jimmy was killed.

558
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:24,629
Oh, Angie...
Say it ain't so.

559
00:31:29,417 --> 00:31:31,068
Yeah, I bought a car.

560
00:31:31,068 --> 00:31:33,050
It was Jimmy's graduation present.

561
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,457
That's quite a gift.

562
00:31:34,457 --> 00:31:35,881
I'm generous.

563
00:31:37,463 --> 00:31:40,499
So how does a high school girl
have that kind of dough?

564
00:31:41,602 --> 00:31:43,584
My parents missed graduation.

565
00:31:43,584 --> 00:31:46,422
Out of guilt, they said
I could buy any car I wanted.

566
00:31:48,586 --> 00:31:50,734
So what did he say?

567
00:31:50,734 --> 00:31:53,651
He kept blowing me off
when I tried to tell him about it.

568
00:31:53,651 --> 00:31:55,552
I finally cornered him
in the parking lot.

569
00:31:55,552 --> 00:31:56,825
Show him the new set of wheels.

570
00:31:56,825 --> 00:31:58,803
Yeah. He saw it.

571
00:31:58,803 --> 00:32:00,063
He kept walking.

572
00:32:00,063 --> 00:32:02,575
Sees a corvette
and doesn't slow his pace?

573
00:32:02,575 --> 00:32:06,025
I know. I'm, like...
Jimmy, it's a corvette.

574
00:32:08,503 --> 00:32:09,855
But no interest.

575
00:32:10,406 --> 00:32:13,534
He was just rambling
about finding Mr. Wyatt.

576
00:32:15,249 --> 00:32:17,929
The math teacher?
Why was he looking for him?

577
00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:18,865
I don't know.

578
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:22,934
And I'll never know why
he was so into Quinn.

579
00:32:24,145 --> 00:32:26,634
But you should have seen
the way he looked at her.

580
00:32:27,439 --> 00:32:29,004
Now, you didn't get so upset

581
00:32:29,004 --> 00:32:31,590
that you turned that corvette
on him, did you, Angie?

582
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:35,450
I can't even drive stick shift.

583
00:32:40,095 --> 00:32:41,593
Ever have kids, Jered?

584
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,235
No, we never did.

585
00:32:45,235 --> 00:32:46,647
We've done some looking.

586
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,259
Seems you and your wife poured a lot
of time and money into trying for a baby.

587
00:32:51,259 --> 00:32:53,843
- Maybe for a short period.
- Six years.

588
00:32:54,483 --> 00:32:59,908
Well, we adjusted.
We have hobbies, pets.

589
00:32:59,908 --> 00:33:02,345
But that kind of thing
can make a marriage shaky.

590
00:33:02,345 --> 00:33:03,477
There was some strain.

591
00:33:03,477 --> 00:33:05,300
How were you gonna turn things around?

592
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,971
How about a baby?

593
00:33:06,971 --> 00:33:08,189
What are you suggesting?

594
00:33:08,189 --> 00:33:09,984
Oh, why else would Jimmy
come looking for you

595
00:33:09,984 --> 00:33:12,503
same night Quinn had that child?

596
00:33:12,944 --> 00:33:14,442
There's no proof of anything.

597
00:33:14,442 --> 00:33:16,854
Well, throw in that you
were at the sonogram,

598
00:33:16,854 --> 00:33:19,071
seems like you were
a prospective parent.

599
00:33:25,534 --> 00:33:27,159
Please...

600
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:33,232
Jered.

601
00:33:34,727 --> 00:33:37,549
It's no crime, wanting a baby.

602
00:33:39,192 --> 00:33:41,238
That's all Helen and I ever wanted.

603
00:33:42,591 --> 00:33:44,133
Sure.

604
00:33:44,133 --> 00:33:47,328
Our marriage was dying...

605
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:49,845
every day we couldn't conceive.

606
00:33:49,845 --> 00:33:51,962
And these two kids pop out a baby

607
00:33:52,507 --> 00:33:54,682
when they don't even want one.

608
00:33:54,682 --> 00:33:57,844
One weekend and they're pregnant.

609
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:04,004
They had a problem,
we had a problem.

610
00:34:06,308 --> 00:34:08,509
I really thought this baby could...

611
00:34:11,046 --> 00:34:12,465
could save us.

612
00:34:13,867 --> 00:34:15,988
So what went wrong?

613
00:34:31,876 --> 00:34:33,262
I got the car seat,

614
00:34:33,262 --> 00:34:35,470
diapers, formula.

615
00:34:36,173 --> 00:34:37,382
I thought of everything.

616
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,931
- So boy or girl?
- Uh, girl.

617
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:47,490
- So is Quinn bringing her?
- Uh, no.

618
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:51,048
Mr. Wyatt, I can't do it.

619
00:34:52,028 --> 00:34:54,709
No, no, no...
We're all set.

620
00:34:55,232 --> 00:34:56,665
I'm sorry.

621
00:35:02,942 --> 00:35:07,862
What? / Look, I know I'm going back
on our plan, and I'm sorry about it,

622
00:35:07,862 --> 00:35:10,187
but after seeing what I saw...

623
00:35:10,187 --> 00:35:13,522
well, I realized,
those two girls are all I want.

624
00:35:13,522 --> 00:35:15,170
I'm trying to save my marriage here.

625
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:16,488
I'm trying to save something, too.

626
00:35:16,488 --> 00:35:18,897
This is my last hope.
Helen is waiting!

627
00:35:18,897 --> 00:35:20,321
Sorry, Mr. Wyatt.

628
00:35:20,321 --> 00:35:21,730
Maybe you can adopt or something.

629
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:23,890
We have already tried that!

630
00:35:27,061 --> 00:35:28,870
Jimmy...

631
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,777
listen to me now.

632
00:35:31,225 --> 00:35:32,810
Jimmy!

633
00:35:33,478 --> 00:35:35,777
This is my life I'm talking about!

634
00:35:36,504 --> 00:35:37,976
Jimmy!

635
00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:39,969
Questioned documents got an imprint
from Claire's note, a phone number.

636
00:36:39,969 --> 00:36:41,211
We trace it?

637
00:36:41,211 --> 00:36:43,316
Viking motel, Spring garden.

638
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,732
There she is.

639
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,001
Hi, Claire.

640
00:37:12,178 --> 00:37:13,689
How'd you find me?

641
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:14,798
That doesn't matter.

642
00:37:14,798 --> 00:37:15,940
Claire, what's going on?

643
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,159
You want to stop there?

644
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:18,598
The hell with that.

645
00:37:18,598 --> 00:37:19,892
No!

646
00:37:20,832 --> 00:37:22,432
You're under arrest.

647
00:37:22,432 --> 00:37:24,340
Endangering the welfare of a child.

648
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,437
His family left him.
I'm all he has.

649
00:37:26,437 --> 00:37:27,895
But you're not his.

650
00:37:44,823 --> 00:37:46,231
Look at me.

651
00:37:46,852 --> 00:37:48,985
We brought your mommy.

652
00:37:48,985 --> 00:37:50,028
What?

653
00:37:50,028 --> 00:37:52,298
She was real worried about you.

654
00:37:59,994 --> 00:38:01,594
My god.

655
00:38:02,369 --> 00:38:05,635
I can see Jimmy all over your face.

656
00:38:05,635 --> 00:38:07,146
Not that you care.

657
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,947
I do.
I do, baby.

658
00:38:09,947 --> 00:38:11,849
Don't call me that!

659
00:38:15,998 --> 00:38:18,885
I messed up. Bad.

660
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:24,231
I was just so sad that
Jimmy didn't want me anymore.

661
00:38:24,998 --> 00:38:26,585
He did want you.

662
00:38:27,504 --> 00:38:29,160
We know who hit him that night.

663
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:34,745
It was Jered Wyatt. / Yeah...

664
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:36,500
And you know the reason, Claire?

665
00:38:38,258 --> 00:38:39,703
You.

666
00:38:41,521 --> 00:38:43,810
- What do you mean?
- He wanted you for himself.

667
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:47,554
But Jimmy said no,
because the second he laid eyes on you,

668
00:38:47,554 --> 00:38:50,114
no way he was parting with his girl.

669
00:38:51,474 --> 00:38:52,992
Jimmy said that?

670
00:38:54,483 --> 00:38:55,973
He was on his way back to you.

671
00:39:02,266 --> 00:39:04,453
"It's all over."

672
00:39:04,453 --> 00:39:06,140
That's what Jimmy said to you.

673
00:39:07,425 --> 00:39:09,487
Now I know what he meant.

674
00:39:18,797 --> 00:39:19,879
Oh, my god.

675
00:39:20,419 --> 00:39:22,026
You did it!

676
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,485
- No.
- You did.

677
00:39:25,485 --> 00:39:27,849
I've never done anything, Jimmy.

678
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:30,013
You just did.

679
00:39:30,013 --> 00:39:32,472
You did the most amazing thing.

680
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,490
It's a girl.

681
00:39:38,366 --> 00:39:39,734
Yeah?

682
00:39:40,985 --> 00:39:43,414
She's real small, Quinn.

683
00:39:49,141 --> 00:39:51,152
No, I can't.

684
00:39:51,152 --> 00:39:52,243
Sure you can.

685
00:39:52,243 --> 00:39:55,221
- I'll drop her.
- No.

686
00:39:56,251 --> 00:39:58,623
Look how you're holding her.

687
00:39:59,496 --> 00:40:01,009
A baby girl.

688
00:40:02,794 --> 00:40:04,566
It's all over now.

689
00:40:08,227 --> 00:40:09,449
I know.

690
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:16,620
I have to find him.

691
00:40:21,907 --> 00:40:23,941
I just want to hold
her a little more.

692
00:40:26,149 --> 00:40:28,254
I'll be right back.

693
00:40:51,756 --> 00:40:52,773
Jimmy...

694
00:40:53,645 --> 00:40:55,352
Jimmy!

695
00:41:21,925 --> 00:41:23,122
Oh, Claire...

696
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:31,548
No matter what happens, baby,

697
00:41:32,398 --> 00:41:35,029
your mom and dad loved you.

698
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:11,882
* Peter GabrielÀÇ 'In Your Eyes' *

699
00:42:13,179 --> 00:42:15,009
* Love *

700
00:42:17,585 --> 00:42:24,021
* I get so lost, sometimes *

701
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:27,836
* Days pass *

702
00:42:28,687 --> 00:42:34,188
* and this emptiness fills my heart *

703
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:39,718
* When I want to run away *

704
00:42:39,718 --> 00:42:44,385
* I drive off in my car *

705
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:50,182
* But whichever way I go *

706
00:42:50,182 --> 00:42:54,691
* I come back to the place you are *

707
00:42:57,551 --> 00:43:00,242
* And all my instincts, *

708
00:43:00,242 --> 00:43:01,922
* they return *

709
00:43:02,764 --> 00:43:04,592
* And the grand facade, *

710
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:07,199
* so soon will burn *

711
00:43:08,036 --> 00:43:09,868
* Without a noise, *

712
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:12,704
* without my pride *

713
00:43:13,169 --> 00:43:18,953
* I reach out from the inside *

714
00:43:24,416 --> 00:43:26,922
* In your eyes *

715
00:43:26,922 --> 00:43:29,505

(In your eyes)*

717
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,725
* I see the doorway
(In your eyes)*

718
00:43:34,725 --> 00:43:37,505
* to a thousand churches
(In your eyes)*

719
00:43:37,505 --> 00:43:40,196
* The resolution
(In your eyes)*

720
00:43:40,196 --> 00:43:43,213
* of all the fruitless searches
(In your eyes)*

721
00:43:44,325 --> 00:43:48,726
* I see the light and the heat
(In your eyes)*

722
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:54,238
* Oh, I want to be that complete
(In your eyes)*

723
00:43:54,238 --> 00:43:59,146
* I want to touch the light
The heat I seen your eyes *

724
00:43:59,146 --> 00:44:01,710
* The light the heat
(In your eyes)*

725

* The resolution
(In your eyes)*

729
00:44:12,375 --> 00:44:15,423
