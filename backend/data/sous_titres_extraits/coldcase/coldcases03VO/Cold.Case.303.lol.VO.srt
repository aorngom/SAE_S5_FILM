00:00:00,286 --> 00:00:02,990
The following story is fictional and does
not depict any actual person or event.

2
00:00:55,821 --> 00:00:57,372
October 29, 1978
I'm a major loser,

3
00:00:57,372 --> 00:00:59,699
screamed like a girl
about 5 times.

4
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:00,738
More like 10.

5
00:01:01,654 --> 00:01:04,048
But I totally dug the dirty stuff,

6
00:01:04,048 --> 00:01:06,016
does that help my manhood?

7
00:01:06,016 --> 00:01:07,961
I don't know,
it just makes you perv.

8
00:01:09,498 --> 00:01:11,253
Hey guys, wait up.

9
00:01:11,253 --> 00:01:13,218
It's not cool to ditch
the wheelchair girl.

10
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:17,927
Oh my god, Vick, I'm so sorry.

11
00:01:17,927 --> 00:01:20,622
In case you haven't noticed,
this thing doesn't have turbo on it.

12
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:21,762
We were gonna wait.

13
00:01:22,804 --> 00:01:26,349
So, anybody want to
go grab a beer or something?

14
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:27,691
I can't, I gotta work tommorrow.

15
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:29,500
Craig, don't be a jerk.

16
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,205
How does having a job
make me a jerk?

17
00:01:31,205 --> 00:01:32,355
Hey, Vick!

18
00:01:33,187 --> 00:01:36,294
Pop, you didn't have
to pick me up.

19
00:01:36,294 --> 00:01:38,108
Well, here I am anyway.

20
00:01:38,108 --> 00:01:39,210
How are you, sir?

21
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,569
It's good to see you.

22
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:41,849
Sorry to break up the party,

23
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:44,084
I just want to get
my girl home safe.

24
00:01:44,084 --> 00:01:46,732
Well, I guess
I'll catch you later, guys.

25
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:47,956
Love you, Vick.

26
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,524
Hey, thanks for coming.

27
00:01:54,308 --> 00:01:55,801
Thanks for asking.

28
00:01:57,773 --> 00:02:00,057
It was really great
to see everybody.

29
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,920
The only reason that I came was
because Vicky asked me to.

30
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,899
It's never going to be the way it was.
You understand?

31
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,541
Let's get out of here.

32
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,756
What if I started a regular poker game?
You interested?

33
00:03:24,756 --> 00:03:26,489
Maybe. Yeah.

34
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:28,199
Geez, don't do me any favors.

35
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,105
Something wrong with
the way I play cards?

36
00:03:32,105 --> 00:03:34,076
You get a little heated up is all,

37
00:03:34,076 --> 00:03:35,026
when things don't go your way.

38
00:03:35,026 --> 00:03:37,043
Yeah? Forget the whole thing.

39
00:03:37,043 --> 00:03:38,711
Hey Jo, do you play cards?

40
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:40,814
Sure. I'm a Texas holdum girl.

41
00:03:40,814 --> 00:03:42,461
There you go.

42
00:03:46,343 --> 00:03:48,739
It's for the best, trust me.

43
00:03:50,712 --> 00:03:52,311
Who's Lil talking to?

44
00:03:52,311 --> 00:03:54,130
Woman who's son was
killed back in '78,

45
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,916
supposedly a copycat
murder off the movie Halloween.

46
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:04,393
I'm moving and I found this
when I was boxing up Angus's things.

47
00:04:04,393 --> 00:04:05,367
What is it?

48
00:04:05,367 --> 00:04:07,639
It's a letter to Angus
from his friend Vicky,

49
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,326
written the day he died.

50
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,845
'You say you want to marry me

51
00:04:12,845 --> 00:04:14,711
but you don't know
what that means.'

52
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:16,208
Angus was over the moon for Vicky,

53
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,117
but I never knew he'd proposed.

54
00:04:18,117 --> 00:04:20,038
She's asking for more time.

55
00:04:21,237 --> 00:04:24,078
'Don't tell anybody,
it's too dangerous for you.'

56
00:04:24,078 --> 00:04:28,763
Angus and Vicky were in a terrible
accident, 6 months before he died.

57
00:04:28,763 --> 00:04:29,843
What happened?

58
00:04:29,843 --> 00:04:32,780
Angus was driving too fast.

59
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,626
He was lucky but Vicky,

60
00:04:35,626 --> 00:04:37,561
she was paralized.

61
00:04:37,561 --> 00:04:39,664
And people blamed Angus.

62
00:04:39,664 --> 00:04:42,904
You think he was killed because
someone found out about this proposal?

63
00:04:42,904 --> 00:04:44,742
Yes, I do.

64
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:48,092
The man they arrested back then,
it just never felt right to me.

65
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:53,513
I'm afraid that's not much
to go on, Mrs. Bistrong.

66
00:04:53,513 --> 00:04:56,516
You would have liked Angus, detective,
he would have made you smile.

67
00:04:56,516 --> 00:04:58,146
I'm sure you're right.

68
00:04:58,859 --> 00:05:02,482
I'm moving from the house
where I raised that little boy on my own.

69
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:06,169
All I want is to leave his spirit
with some kind of peace.

70
00:05:06,805 --> 00:05:09,411
It's where good karma
comes from, you know.

71
00:05:10,447 --> 00:05:12,670
Acts of kindness.

72
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,187
I don't really go in for
that kind of thing.

73
00:05:18,241 --> 00:05:20,518
Do you go in for finding the truth?

74
00:06:02,244 --> 00:06:04,085
All signs pointed to Eddie Foster,

75
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:06,752
the nut job who dressed like
the killer from Halloween.

76
00:06:06,752 --> 00:06:10,403
Stabs a girl in Grey's Ferry
the night before.

77
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,193
I remember the press
loved this story.

78
00:06:12,193 --> 00:06:15,482
And Angus was found
in the same area as the first victim,

79
00:06:15,482 --> 00:06:17,101
less than 24 hours later.

80
00:06:17,101 --> 00:06:18,732
Fibers from Foster's trunk

81
00:06:18,732 --> 00:06:21,112
matched the ones found on the girl.

82
00:06:21,112 --> 00:06:23,315
No fibers were recovered on Angus.

83
00:06:23,315 --> 00:06:25,694
- That's something.
- Not much.

84
00:06:25,694 --> 00:06:28,336
Come on, I got karma
on the line here.

85
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:30,968
Foster's not going
to be very helpful,

86
00:06:30,968 --> 00:06:33,174
he killed himself a week
before his trial.

87
00:06:33,174 --> 00:06:37,712
Autopsy says Angus's body was moved
post mortem to the movie theater.

88
00:06:38,286 --> 00:06:41,580
We'll run his clothes again, see if
the new scan picks up trace fibers.

89
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,287
They talked to the friends Angus was with
that night, trying to retrace his steps.

90
00:06:45,287 --> 00:06:47,830
The car accident's probably
the reason he was killed.

91
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,443
That was 6 months
before he died.

92
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:51,406
Believe me, it's motive enough.

93
00:06:51,406 --> 00:06:54,052
Well for now let's focus
on the secret proposal.

94
00:06:54,786 --> 00:06:56,819
A tight group
of friends like that,

95
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:58,354
hard to keep anything secret.

96
00:06:58,354 --> 00:07:01,064
Well, we'll follow the grapevine,
start at the roots.

97
00:07:01,064 --> 00:07:03,751
Vicky, the girl from the accident.

98
00:07:16,914 --> 00:07:18,511
You have small children?

99
00:07:21,004 --> 00:07:23,453
Well, not of our own,
that wasn't in the cards.

100
00:07:23,453 --> 00:07:25,527
I'm a kindergarten teacher.

101
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:27,217
The kids go nuts for her.

102
00:07:27,217 --> 00:07:28,819
And I love the kids.

103
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:31,393
The pain in the ass parents,
I can do without.

104
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:34,477
But you wanted
to talk about Angus.

105
00:07:34,477 --> 00:07:36,604
Yeah, we're taking
another look at the case.

106
00:07:36,604 --> 00:07:37,928
After all this time?

107
00:07:37,928 --> 00:07:39,133
Did something new come up?

108
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:40,763
It looks like it, yeah.

109
00:07:40,763 --> 00:07:42,696
Vicky, we heard Angus
proposed to you,

110
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:44,173
right before he died.

111
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:45,534
How did you know about that?

112
00:07:45,534 --> 00:07:48,277
His mom found your letter.

113
00:07:48,277 --> 00:07:50,853
You seemed very worried for Angus.

114
00:07:50,853 --> 00:07:52,952
Didn't want him telling anybody.

115
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:55,789
Well, after the accident,

116
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:59,931
our friends couldn't forgive him for
what happened, they were...

117
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:01,458
brutal.

118
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:04,141
Who rode him the hardest?

119
00:08:04,141 --> 00:08:06,350
- Craig.
- Why?

120
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:09,862
He was my boyfriend
before the accident.

121
00:08:09,862 --> 00:08:11,541
Needed to blame somebody
for what happened.

122
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,773
We heard Angus was
driving pretty fast.

123
00:08:13,773 --> 00:08:15,550
Yeah, and you've never done that?

124
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,976
Vick, they're just trying to help.

125
00:08:17,976 --> 00:08:20,900
Yeah, I know, I know.

126
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,369
It was an accident, detective.

127
00:08:23,895 --> 00:08:26,288
And Craig saw it all go down.

128
00:08:27,814 --> 00:08:29,776
We should rent a house
together this summer.

129
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:30,856
And we don't have school.

130
00:08:30,856 --> 00:08:32,549
Get a totally decent place.

131
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:37,217
Yeah, and we can all go in
on a big color TV, get Atari.

132
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:38,878
What are you, 12?

133
00:08:38,878 --> 00:08:40,353
What are you, 40?

134
00:08:41,141 --> 00:08:42,535
I could dig living with chicks,

135
00:08:42,535 --> 00:08:44,650
always someone around
to do the housework, right?

136
00:08:46,497 --> 00:08:48,832
You know, it's a little
cold for the bike.

137
00:08:48,832 --> 00:08:50,425
Can I go with you?

138
00:08:51,861 --> 00:08:53,467
Yeah, sure.

139
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:56,107
You're gonna pick Angus's beater
over this beautiful ride?

140
00:08:56,107 --> 00:08:58,719
Hey, ease up on
my wheels, man.

141
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:00,028
I'm not too cold.

142
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:02,346
All right.

143
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,345
This is not a beater,
this is a classic.

144
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:17,998
Come on, let's blow
this taco stand.

145
00:09:17,998 --> 00:09:20,095
Show Craig what
a beater can do.

146
00:09:28,883 --> 00:09:30,813
You're awsome,
you know that?

147
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,273
Later, dude.

148
00:09:55,535 --> 00:09:56,986
Angus!

149
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:11,670
Oh, my god.

150
00:10:12,622 --> 00:10:15,020
Hang on,
we'll get you out of there.

151
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,705
It's jammed tight!

152
00:10:23,803 --> 00:10:25,177
You OK?

153
00:10:29,857 --> 00:10:32,572
I was looking to get
Craig riled up.

154
00:10:33,602 --> 00:10:37,133
Remind him that I had
...........options.

155
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:38,951
So, the way you figure it,

156
00:10:38,951 --> 00:10:42,403
the accident was....
part your fault.

157
00:10:42,403 --> 00:10:44,408
I was the one who
egged him on.

158
00:10:46,055 --> 00:10:47,847
If I hadn't....

159
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:52,015
She found a way to forgive Angus
but she's never forgiven herself.

160
00:10:53,652 --> 00:10:56,341
Well, after that,
everything changed.

161
00:10:56,341 --> 00:10:58,931
It was Life, Part 2.

162
00:10:58,931 --> 00:11:02,692
Your friends ever threaten
Angus direct?

163
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:05,343
Craig did.
A few times.

164
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,602
Told Angus to stay away from me
or he's regret it.

165
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:12,358
Any chance Craig found out somehow
about Angus proposing?

166
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:18,614
Angus had this fantasy that things
would go back to normal.

167
00:11:18,614 --> 00:11:21,885
That Craig would be
his best bud again.

168
00:11:22,942 --> 00:11:25,638
He might have reached
out to Craig.

169
00:11:25,638 --> 00:11:27,409
Ask for his support.

170
00:11:27,994 --> 00:11:30,171
It would have been
a really bad move.

171
00:11:42,837 --> 00:11:45,104
I respect the  police.

172
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,969
You guys do stellar work,

173
00:11:46,969 --> 00:11:49,574
laying your ass on the line for
us average Joe's.

174
00:11:49,574 --> 00:11:51,592
Laying the butter pretty
thick there, Craig.

175
00:11:51,592 --> 00:11:53,169
I'm just speaking the truth.

176
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:55,081
Why don't we get
back to Angus.

177
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,018
We heard you were pretty
rough on your old pal.

178
00:11:57,018 --> 00:11:58,475
Hey, he brought it
on himself.

179
00:11:58,475 --> 00:12:00,102
Bad enough
what he did, then

180
00:12:00,102 --> 00:12:02,202
he wouldn't take
responsibility for it.

181
00:12:02,202 --> 00:12:04,062
Meaning he blamed
someone else?

182
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,468
Well for a while it was the car
flipped too easy,

183
00:12:07,468 --> 00:12:09,536
you know,
then the brakes were bad.

184
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,793
Said he was gonna sue,

185
00:12:11,793 --> 00:12:13,783
but nothing ever came
of it, of course.

186
00:12:13,783 --> 00:12:15,673
You know Angus popped
the question at Vicky

187
00:12:15,673 --> 00:12:17,248
the day he was killed?

188
00:12:18,257 --> 00:12:19,946
No, I didn't.

189
00:12:20,748 --> 00:12:23,444
Where'd you go that night,
after the movie?

190
00:12:23,444 --> 00:12:26,203
Out with Donna,
got some beers.

191
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,590
Crashed at her place.

192
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,557
Donna who we hear is in
Europe, somewhere?

193
00:12:30,557 --> 00:12:33,068
I had no idea Angus
proposed, OK?

194
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:35,014
Thought you and Vicky
were an item.

195
00:12:36,316 --> 00:12:38,770
OK, I know how this sounds,

196
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,146
but after the accidents
my feelings changed.

197
00:12:41,146 --> 00:12:42,344
Changed how?

198
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,956
I still cared about her.

199
00:12:43,956 --> 00:12:46,707
She wasn't exactly girlfriend
material anymore.

200
00:12:46,707 --> 00:12:49,862
Wow. That kind of
loyalty must have

201
00:12:49,862 --> 00:12:51,861
really helped her
through the hard times.

202
00:12:51,861 --> 00:12:54,471
Give me a break here,
I was a kid.

203
00:12:54,471 --> 00:12:57,335
Besides everything had
changed between us.

204
00:12:57,335 --> 00:12:58,913
All of us.

205
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:11,556
I was just dropping something
off I got for her, OK?

206
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:13,722
Just go, Angus.

207
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:17,891
You gotta forgive
me sometime, Craig.

208
00:13:19,046 --> 00:13:22,038
You're my best friend, man.

209
00:13:22,038 --> 00:13:23,982
I'm nothing to you anymore.

210
00:13:25,322 --> 00:13:27,591
Let's go in. See Vicky.

211
00:13:34,783 --> 00:13:38,886
Hey, Vick. Couple of losers
here to see you.

212
00:13:43,127 --> 00:13:45,928
I'm not feeling
so great today, guys. Sorry.

213
00:13:45,928 --> 00:13:49,631
- That's cool.
- Oh, it's totally understandable.

214
00:13:49,631 --> 00:13:52,697
So we were thinking we could throw
a major bash when you get better.

215
00:13:52,697 --> 00:13:53,858
We'll do it at my parent's place,

216
00:13:53,858 --> 00:13:55,561
get a band, have a dance floor,

217
00:13:55,561 --> 00:13:56,607
make it decent.

218
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,276
Yeah, do my classic
frozen margaritas,

219
00:13:58,276 --> 00:13:59,771
get everybody wasted.

220
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,907
Hey, obviously she doesn't
care about some party right now.

221
00:14:02,907 --> 00:14:03,979
Let her rest.

222
00:14:03,979 --> 00:14:05,950
God I was,
we were just trying to...

223
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,466
She's not in the mood
for that kind of stuff.

224
00:14:07,466 --> 00:14:08,550
Stop hollering at her.

225
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,000
Hey, we really respect
that you did save her,

226
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,637
but she's our friend, OK?

227
00:14:17,501 --> 00:14:19,173
We'll be back later, Vick.

228
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:31,490
So who was the guy hanging
around Vicky's room?

229
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,173
The fireman who pulled her
out of the car, saved her life.

230
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,071
What was he doing there?

231
00:14:36,071 --> 00:14:37,272
He was always there.

232
00:14:37,272 --> 00:14:39,139
So he fell for her?

233
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:43,269
I thought he was just basking
in the hero glow at first but

234
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:45,756
it turned out, yeah,
he fell for her.

235
00:14:45,756 --> 00:14:49,305
Maybe he would of had something to
say if he found out Angus proposed.

236
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,026
I'd put money on it.

237
00:14:51,026 --> 00:14:52,834
So whatever happened
to this guy?

238
00:14:55,203 --> 00:14:58,097
Vicky married him.
That's what.

239
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,751
The fireman's her husband.

240
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:08,504
Women love firemen.

241
00:15:08,504 --> 00:15:10,443
It's like a disease or something.

242
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:15,077
Yeah. Give a lady a choice between a
nice looking detective and a mutt fireman.

243
00:15:15,077 --> 00:15:16,972
They'll go for the dog,
every time.

244
00:15:16,972 --> 00:15:18,952
This fireman was a big hero.

245
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:21,041
Pulled Vicky from the burning car.

246
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:23,620
And neither of them mentioned it
when you talked to her? / Nope.

247
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,656
The ex, Craig said the fireman
was a real possessive type.

248
00:15:26,656 --> 00:15:29,480
Might get really worked up about
a proposal coming Vicky's way.

249
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,938
If he knew about it.

250
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:32,198
The ex point at anyone else?

251
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:35,300
That Angus was looking in to
that the car was faulty.

252
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,582
Drives like a maniac,
blames the car.

253
00:15:37,582 --> 00:15:39,844
The accident report says
he wasn't driving more than 45.

254
00:15:39,844 --> 00:15:41,602
- Just didn't seem that......
- The limit there is 30.

255
00:15:41,602 --> 00:15:43,649
Do you know how many
pedestriansget mowed down by

256
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:45,310
idiots speeding down that road?

257
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:48,647
Hey, I'm just saying
what's in the AID report.

258
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:52,806
Will, let's talk to Angus's mother,
see what he was looking in to.

259
00:15:52,806 --> 00:15:57,108
And we'll find out why we didn't get
the full story on our hero fireman.

260
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:02,404
- Wanna grab some coffee Jo?
- Yeah, sure.

261
00:16:08,227 --> 00:16:10,689
So, did I say something
wrong up there? / Well...

262
00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:12,667
I got an attitude
too quick, huh? / Sutton...

263
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:14,617
- Cause I'm woring on that.
- Hey. (Time out)

264
00:16:16,926 --> 00:16:23,088
I wanted you to know Will's wife was
killed about 10 years ago, hit and run.

265
00:16:23,088 --> 00:16:28,777
Now this case, the accident,
it seems it's on his mind. / Crap.

266
00:16:29,545 --> 00:16:32,060
- And I was mouthing off.
- You didn't know.

267
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,596
- One black coffee, what can I get you?
- Coffee, regular.

268
00:16:36,547 --> 00:16:37,840
I could wear a dunce cap.

269
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,066
Oh, he's probably sold out of those.

270
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:47,943
- You'll get to know these guys, Jo.
- Yeah, I know.

271
00:16:49,312 --> 00:16:52,272
I'll meet you back at...
Thanks, boss.

272
00:17:00,364 --> 00:17:03,364
All I have is green tea,
is that all right?

273
00:17:03,364 --> 00:17:04,883
That'll be fine.

274
00:17:07,617 --> 00:17:11,182
You think I get too heated up
when I play cards? / Yeah.

275
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:15,756
I'm so grateful to you for
looking in to this case.

276
00:17:17,964 --> 00:17:20,715
Mrs. Bistrong, we heard that
Angus thought something

277
00:17:20,715 --> 00:17:23,790
might have gone wrong
with his car, causing it to flip.

278
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,570
He talked about it
constantly at first.

279
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,974
I told him to stop
thinking like that.

280
00:17:28,974 --> 00:17:31,065
Good of you.

281
00:17:32,109 --> 00:17:34,104
A few days before he died,

282
00:17:34,104 --> 00:17:36,290
I talked to him about it.

283
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:38,633
And he surprised me.

284
00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:40,058
Angus?

285
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:46,958
I got the Drexel course list for you.

286
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:52,213
Maybe it's time to finish up
that last semester and get your degree.

287
00:17:52,213 --> 00:17:54,624
I have enough
in the savings account.

288
00:17:54,624 --> 00:17:58,942
Thanks mom but I'm kind of
swamped right now.

289
00:17:59,569 --> 00:18:01,839
Oh, Angus, please stop
torturing yourself,

290
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:03,855
none of this can change
what happened.

291
00:18:03,855 --> 00:18:05,300
If it wasn't all my fault,

292
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,580
people might not hate me
so much. / Angus...

293
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,140
And Vicky might look
at me differently.

294
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,015
She's forgiven you.

295
00:18:13,323 --> 00:18:15,779
All I want is that
one second back.

296
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:18,698
So I can hit the brakes sooner
and move around the truck.

297
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:23,487
Gussy, from the time
you were a tiny boy,

298
00:18:23,487 --> 00:18:28,591
you have been the sweetest spirit
on this earth,the most gentle.

299
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:32,042
You didn't mean to hurt anybody,
it was an accident.

300
00:18:32,042 --> 00:18:37,469
Forgive yourself.
Try to move forward.

301
00:18:37,469 --> 00:18:39,734
I am moving forward, mom.

302
00:18:40,397 --> 00:18:42,025
[Firefighting : Vehicles And Equipment]

303
00:18:43,734 --> 00:18:46,990
I'll be OK.  You'll see.

304
00:18:51,901 --> 00:18:54,498
I think he wanted
to become a fireman.

305
00:18:54,498 --> 00:18:56,268
Save people.

306
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,328
Like that fireman
who saved Vicky.

307
00:18:58,328 --> 00:19:00,197
Did he ever take the test?

308
00:19:00,197 --> 00:19:01,357
Never got to.

309
00:19:01,357 --> 00:19:03,531
He was killed
a few days later.

310
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,176
Do you still have
those manuals of his?

311
00:19:06,176 --> 00:19:09,355
I'm sure I do,
I don't throw anything of his away.

312
00:19:09,355 --> 00:19:11,775
- I'll find them for you.
- Appreciate it.

313
00:19:15,831 --> 00:19:18,315
Angus was a good boy, detective.

314
00:19:18,315 --> 00:19:21,979
Even if accepting what he had done
was too much for him to bear.

315
00:19:32,453 --> 00:19:35,431
Pretty big piece of information
you two left out, Ian.

316
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,438
With all due respect,
I never really knew Angus.

317
00:19:39,438 --> 00:19:41,146
Or any of that group.

318
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:43,761
They were college kids,
I was a working guy.

319
00:19:43,761 --> 00:19:45,848
We heard you boxed people out.

320
00:19:45,848 --> 00:19:47,796
Didn't want anyone else
hanging around.

321
00:19:47,796 --> 00:19:49,129
That's crap.

322
00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:51,409
I wasn't the reason
those friends busted up.

323
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:52,489
Meaning what?

324
00:19:52,489 --> 00:19:55,746
The sad truth is, it happens a lot
after accidents like that.

325
00:19:55,746 --> 00:19:57,915
People can't handle it,
don't know how to be.

326
00:19:57,915 --> 00:19:59,545
You know about Angus proposing?

327
00:19:59,545 --> 00:20:00,992
Not back then.

328
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:03,339
But it's not something I would
have been concerned about.

329
00:20:03,339 --> 00:20:04,501
Why is that?

330
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:07,783
Angus was always gonna be the reason
she's in that chair, simple as that.

331
00:20:07,783 --> 00:20:11,108
A letter we got says she was
seriously considering marrying the guy.

332
00:20:12,388 --> 00:20:14,713
This might sound terrible,

333
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:18,141
but Vicky told me the only reason
she didn't say no right off

334
00:20:18,141 --> 00:20:21,041
is she thought Angus is the only
guy to ever want her.

335
00:20:21,425 --> 00:20:22,898
Where were you?

336
00:20:22,898 --> 00:20:24,625
The night he was killed, Ian?

337
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:28,325
Vicky asked me to the movie but I had an
early shift the next day so I stayed in.

338
00:20:28,325 --> 00:20:31,080
Not much of an alibi but
it's God's honest truth.

339
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,241
- We'll look in to it.
- Of course.

340
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:36,338
You have any thoughts
about who killed Angus?

341
00:20:36,338 --> 00:20:38,024
We thought it was that Foster guy.

342
00:20:38,024 --> 00:20:41,359
- All the news said so.
- You don't sound so 100%.

343
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:45,941
Something happened
a few weeks before Angus died.

344
00:20:48,091 --> 00:20:51,057
- Hey, Mr. Leoni,
- Tony / Devin.

345
00:20:51,057 --> 00:20:52,223
Where's Vicky?

346
00:20:52,223 --> 00:20:54,081
The therapist said
a friend took her for a walk.

347
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,628
So Vicky tells me
you play football, huh?

348
00:20:57,628 --> 00:20:59,939
Yeah, he's been missing a lot of
practices and comes here.

349
00:20:59,939 --> 00:21:01,239
It's no big deal.

350
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:02,979
Well, you're a good little bro, kid.

351
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:07,057
You know, she could walk again.
If she keeps working at it.

352
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,443
Devin, we've talked about this.

353
00:21:08,443 --> 00:21:10,420
It's possible.
That's all I'm saying.

354
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:14,536
Possible. Right?

355
00:21:17,037 --> 00:21:19,663
Well we can pray for her.
That's for sure.

356
00:21:19,663 --> 00:21:23,511
She's totally evil.
She yells at me after every exercise.

357
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:28,131
Hi, guys.

358
00:21:31,134 --> 00:21:33,075
- Oh, god...Sorry.
- Are you retarded?

359
00:21:33,075 --> 00:21:35,640
Can't you do anything
without hurting somebody? / Pop!

360
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,943
Mr. Leoni. / You walk in with a stupid
grin on your face like something's funny.

361
00:21:38,943 --> 00:21:41,394
- I should just knock it right off!
- Easy there.

362
00:21:41,394 --> 00:21:43,603
Get out! / Easy.

363
00:21:43,603 --> 00:21:46,511
- I was just trying to help.
- It's a little too late for that.

364
00:21:46,511 --> 00:21:47,705
Too late?

365
00:21:48,635 --> 00:21:51,029
God, can't you see
you're making it worse?

366
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:53,051
Acting like somebody died?

367
00:21:54,137 --> 00:21:56,013
She didn't die.

368
00:21:56,013 --> 00:21:57,620
She's right here.

369
00:22:05,883 --> 00:22:07,835
Vicky didn't tell us about that.

370
00:22:07,835 --> 00:22:09,983
I shouldn't have said anything.

371
00:22:09,983 --> 00:22:11,225
The guy lost his wife early,

372
00:22:11,225 --> 00:22:14,090
those kids were all he had,
of course he was messed up.

373
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,823
The father, a violent guy?

374
00:22:15,823 --> 00:22:17,245
Never knew him that way.

375
00:22:17,245 --> 00:22:20,452
But Vick and him stopped talking
as soon as she moved out.

376
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:22,107
Why is that?

377
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:25,170
All she said about it was the accident
made him a different guy.

378
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,322
Mrs. McAllen.

379
00:22:30,489 --> 00:22:33,263
I heard the messages on the machine
that they were looking for you.

380
00:22:33,263 --> 00:22:35,866
We're just asking him
some questions. That's all.

381
00:22:35,866 --> 00:22:37,907
Babe, I'm fine, you didn't
need to come down here.

382
00:22:37,907 --> 00:22:42,508
Yes, I did. My husband
didn't hurt Angus.

383
00:22:42,508 --> 00:22:45,968
- And I can prove it.
- Yeah, how?

384
00:22:45,968 --> 00:22:50,646
I should have done this a long time ago,
I just couldn't face it. I'm sorry.

385
00:22:53,637 --> 00:22:56,125
Vick, what's going on?

386
00:23:01,878 --> 00:23:03,496
Where did you get that, Vicky?

387
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:08,060
I found it hidden in
my father's hall closet.

388
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,381
The day after Angus was murdered.

389
00:23:23,896 --> 00:23:26,972
Vicky gave us the knife, Mr. Leoni.

390
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:30,176
Someone tried to wipe it clean
but there was residue, looked like blood.

391
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:31,475
What are you talking about?

392
00:23:31,475 --> 00:23:34,005
The knife she found hidden
in your hall closet

393
00:23:34,005 --> 00:23:36,153
the day after Angus's murder.

394
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:41,634
So that's why she kicked
me out of her life.

395
00:23:41,634 --> 00:23:43,809
So the knife was yours?

396
00:23:45,662 --> 00:23:50,732
Yeah, it was mine.
Blood's mine too.

397
00:23:50,732 --> 00:23:54,635
I remember I cut myself
making a salad.

398
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,422
So, why'd you hide it
in the closet?

399
00:23:58,422 --> 00:24:03,075
I put it aside, I was going to
take it in to get sharpened.

400
00:24:04,899 --> 00:24:08,968
And you remember that
all these years later? / Yeah, I do.

401
00:24:09,852 --> 00:24:12,312
You must have been
pretty angry at Angus.

402
00:24:12,312 --> 00:24:14,045
What he did to Vicky.

403
00:24:14,045 --> 00:24:15,590
It's just human.

404
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,265
Well I was furious at first.

405
00:24:17,265 --> 00:24:20,447
We heard about the hospital, how you
got up in his face. Threatened him.

406
00:24:20,447 --> 00:24:22,475
I lost my temper, that's all.

407
00:24:22,475 --> 00:24:24,141
Now, I don't blame you.

408
00:24:25,293 --> 00:24:29,334
I know you loved that girl with everything
you had. / Of course I did.

409
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:32,853
I bet your whole life all you
thought about was keeping her safe.

410
00:24:32,853 --> 00:24:36,637
Making sure she never even
so much as scraped her knee.

411
00:24:37,789 --> 00:24:43,643
Then look what this stupid reckless boy
does without a moments thought.

412
00:24:43,643 --> 00:24:46,886
- But I forgave the kid.
- That's a damn lie.

413
00:24:46,886 --> 00:24:49,289
You never forgive
something like that.

414
00:24:56,802 --> 00:24:58,012
Hey.

415
00:25:00,115 --> 00:25:03,224
I'm Detective Jeffries,
they radioed my wife was in an accident.

416
00:25:03,982 --> 00:25:07,524
Detective. I'm sorry, sir.

417
00:25:07,524 --> 00:25:09,211
Where's my wife, officer?

418
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:15,712
Name on the ID was Mary Jeffries.

419
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:24,376
She was gonna change her tire?

420
00:25:25,794 --> 00:25:27,357
Yes, sir.

421
00:25:28,204 --> 00:25:30,392
rucker must not have seen her
get out of the vehicle.

422
00:25:30,392 --> 00:25:33,846
No that's just not right,
Mary would wait for me.

423
00:25:35,062 --> 00:25:36,971
I should have been
with her tonight,

424
00:25:38,111 --> 00:25:39,863
if I had just been with her.

425
00:25:40,861 --> 00:25:42,664
Can I call someone for you?

426
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,699
They ever find that trucker?

427
00:26:20,816 --> 00:26:25,994
No. But if they had,
I might have killed him.

428
00:26:25,994 --> 00:26:28,638
- I don't think so.
- Why is that?

429
00:26:29,514 --> 00:26:31,032
Because you would
have looked at him.

430
00:26:31,032 --> 00:26:34,568
And you would have seen some poor stiff
who was driving the night shift

431
00:26:34,568 --> 00:26:36,705
just trying to get home
to his family.

432
00:26:36,705 --> 00:26:40,262
Too scared to stop
and face what he did.

433
00:26:40,262 --> 00:26:41,679
You defending what he did?

434
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,328
No, I'm just saying that you probably
would have seen right off,

435
00:26:45,328 --> 00:26:48,864
what it took me a long time
to see in Angus.

436
00:26:48,864 --> 00:26:51,419
It was just an accident.

437
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:55,735
The truth is, on a bad night

438
00:26:55,735 --> 00:26:58,548
it could've been you
or me driving.

439
00:27:05,008 --> 00:27:07,761
Well maybe you forgave Angus.

440
00:27:07,761 --> 00:27:10,181
But someone else
in your house didn't.

441
00:27:11,522 --> 00:27:14,851
If forensics find
that knife killed him,

442
00:27:14,851 --> 00:27:18,875
there's only one other person
who had access to it.

443
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:20,384
Your son.

444
00:27:23,246 --> 00:27:25,210
So the knife was yours, wasn't it?

445
00:27:26,156 --> 00:27:28,110
Yeah, it was mine.
So what?

446
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,119
I was a kid,
I got it for part of a costume.

447
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:32,827
You need a 10 inch steak knife
for a Halloween costume?

448
00:27:32,827 --> 00:27:35,507
I wanted it to look real,
I got the Michael Myers mask,

449
00:27:35,507 --> 00:27:37,434
- the gray jumper...
- Why did you hide the knife?

450
00:27:37,434 --> 00:27:39,473
I threw it there as soon as
I heard about the murder.

451
00:27:39,473 --> 00:27:42,628
I didn't want my pop to see it
in the trash and flip out.

452
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:45,171
I was gonna ditch the knife
in a dumpster later but it was gone.

453
00:27:45,171 --> 00:27:47,883
And you don't ask Vicky or
your pop about it going missing?

454
00:27:47,883 --> 00:27:50,941
You don't understand what
my house was like after that accident.

455
00:27:50,941 --> 00:27:53,308
I was just trying to disappear.

456
00:27:53,308 --> 00:27:55,521
Not upset anybody, ever.

457
00:27:57,998 --> 00:28:01,404
You must have hated Angus
for doing that to your life.

458
00:28:01,404 --> 00:28:04,249
I hated the world after what
happened to Vick.

459
00:28:05,089 --> 00:28:07,457
She always looked out for me.

460
00:28:07,457 --> 00:28:09,058
That's the hand life dealt her.

461
00:28:09,058 --> 00:28:13,584
- That Angus dealt her.
- Yeah. That's right.

462
00:28:14,353 --> 00:28:17,421
And then he's psycho enough
to ask her to marry him.

463
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,278
I just saw you
an hour ago Angus.

464
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:32,041
That's not exactly
giving me time.

465
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:34,310
I said all of this in the letter.

466
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,851
I didn't read your letter.

467
00:28:35,851 --> 00:28:39,249
Look, Angus, I know
you're just doing this out of guilt.

468
00:28:43,948 --> 00:28:46,798
I love you, Vicky Leoni.

469
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:49,252
It hasn't changed since 9th grade
and it's not gonna now.

470
00:28:49,252 --> 00:28:52,533
Quit it. Stand up.

471
00:28:54,356 --> 00:28:57,560
I am messed up, all right?

472
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:02,737
Things don't work right anymore.

473
00:29:02,737 --> 00:29:06,588
You get it? / Do you think that
I care about that stuff?

474
00:29:07,716 --> 00:29:12,411
I know I'm a geek and
you deserve way better,

475
00:29:12,411 --> 00:29:15,442
I mean look at you,
you take my freaking breath away.

476
00:29:16,162 --> 00:29:20,281
Maybe this is right.
You and me.

477
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:24,747
Angus. / What are you doing?

478
00:29:25,953 --> 00:29:28,536
Are you psycho?
Acting like this?

479
00:29:28,536 --> 00:29:31,282
- Devin, it's OK.
- Look what he did to you.

480
00:29:31,282 --> 00:29:35,454
How can you say that's OK,
that's not OK to me.

481
00:29:35,454 --> 00:29:36,745
I'm gonna wake up
my pop if you....

482
00:29:36,745 --> 00:29:40,725
All right, all right Devin,
I'm going man.

483
00:29:52,788 --> 00:29:54,484
Craig was outside your house?

484
00:29:54,484 --> 00:29:56,945
Yeah. He was out there
all the time back then.

485
00:29:56,945 --> 00:29:58,397
Doing what?

486
00:29:58,397 --> 00:29:59,810
Just sat on his bike.

487
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:01,861
Watching the place,
night after night.

488
00:30:03,422 --> 00:30:08,496
So Craig lied. He still had a soft spot
for Vicky, even after the crash.

489
00:30:08,496 --> 00:30:10,133
But Devin was telling the truth.

490
00:30:10,133 --> 00:30:11,484
Knife doesn't match the wounds.

491
00:30:11,484 --> 00:30:14,406
The bloodstains on the handle,
corn starch.

492
00:30:14,406 --> 00:30:15,884
- Costume blood?
- Yep.

493
00:30:15,884 --> 00:30:17,116
Here's something.

494
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:20,733
Chemical tests on Angus's clothes came
back, it picked up traces of elk skin.

495
00:30:20,733 --> 00:30:22,097
What's elk skin used for?

496
00:30:22,097 --> 00:30:24,398
Most common use?
Motorcycle gloves.

497
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:29,149
And it's our boy Craig
who had that beautiful ride.

498
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,780
Devin told us about your
stalker routine outside Vicky's place.

499
00:30:39,895 --> 00:30:43,526
You still in love means
you have a motive to get rid of
the competition.

500
00:30:43,526 --> 00:30:45,274
You don't understand.

501
00:30:46,327 --> 00:30:48,209
We're a little dim.

502
00:30:48,209 --> 00:30:50,001
Why don't you explain it to us?

503
00:30:50,001 --> 00:30:52,279
I just wanted to talk to her.

504
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:53,808
Beg her to forgive me.

505
00:30:53,808 --> 00:30:55,861
Forgive you? For what?

506
00:30:58,018 --> 00:30:59,498
What I did.

507
00:30:59,498 --> 00:31:00,847
You talking about the night of the murder?

508
00:31:00,847 --> 00:31:03,182
No, I'm talking about the crash.

509
00:31:03,182 --> 00:31:04,564
What happened there?

510
00:31:07,684 --> 00:31:10,852
You're on the hook for murder Craig
and we're losing our patience here.

511
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,660
I was right there when it happened.

512
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,234
I could have helped her but I froze.

513
00:31:41,494 --> 00:31:45,775
Oh, my god, please,

515
00:31:52,909 --> 00:31:54,447

Craig, help me.

519
00:32:11,716 --> 00:32:16,131
Craig, help

520
00:32:16,131 --> 00:32:17,797
Oh, man.

521
00:32:17,797 --> 00:32:19,537
Hang on, we're gonna
get you out of there.

522
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:22,648
Help me. Craig,

523
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:27,181
are you there? Craig.

524
00:32:27,181 --> 00:32:30,173
are you there? Craig.

525
00:32:30,173 --> 00:32:31,311
It's jammed tight!

526
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:37,047
Craig, oh help me. Craig.

527
00:32:37,047 --> 00:32:40,024
Easy there. / I gotta get her
out of here before it catches.

528
00:32:41,531 --> 00:32:46,437
Easy, easy.

529
00:32:48,006 --> 00:32:51,355
Please help me, Craig.

530
00:32:51,355 --> 00:32:53,109
Are you there?

531
00:32:54,386 --> 00:32:57,151
Are you there? Craig?

532
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,873
I couldn't move.

533
00:33:01,569 --> 00:33:03,364
I was a pathetic coward.

534
00:33:04,058 --> 00:33:06,356
I blamed Angus for all of it.

535
00:33:06,356 --> 00:33:07,745
But I didn't kill him.

536
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:13,608
So you were hanging around
her house to apologize?

537
00:33:14,734 --> 00:33:16,227
Night after night.

538
00:33:17,227 --> 00:33:18,964
Trying to get up the nerve.

539
00:33:18,964 --> 00:33:20,226
But I never did.

540
00:33:21,719 --> 00:33:24,696
Craig, you heard Vicky say her leg hurt.

541
00:33:24,696 --> 00:33:27,117
You sure about that? / Yeah.

542
00:33:27,117 --> 00:33:32,023
And you saw her try and
kick off the seat belt? / Yeah. So?

543
00:33:35,843 --> 00:33:38,074
Angus wasn't studying
to be a fireman.

544
00:33:52,191 --> 00:33:54,156
Did you find something out?

545
00:33:54,156 --> 00:33:56,001
Yeah, we did.

546
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:59,837
Was it...did my father kill Angus?

547
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:04,076
No. But you knew that.

548
00:34:04,076 --> 00:34:05,686
What?

549
00:34:05,686 --> 00:34:07,657
What are you talking about?

550
00:34:07,657 --> 00:34:09,810
Ian couldn't have
put the knife there.

551
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:11,738
That knife didn't kill Angus.

552
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,601
It's part of your brothers
Halloween costume.

553
00:34:16,874 --> 00:34:18,876
We talked to your old partner.

554
00:34:18,876 --> 00:34:20,708
The one who covered for you
way back then.

555
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:24,351
We know things went wrong
when you used the jaws of life.

556
00:34:24,822 --> 00:34:28,628
"A terrible mistake,"
Your partner said.

557
00:34:28,628 --> 00:34:32,193
"Made by an eager,real talented rookie."

558
00:34:32,193 --> 00:34:33,833
And Angus figured it out.

559
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:35,468
Started reading up.

560
00:34:35,468 --> 00:34:38,631
Ian? What's going on?

561
00:34:39,558 --> 00:34:41,617
I had to get you out.

562
00:34:41,617 --> 00:34:44,267
Smoke was coming
out of that engine.

563
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,659
You saved me.

564
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:48,822
He was trying to save you.

565
00:34:48,822 --> 00:34:51,005
He saw the car was
about to catch fire.

566
00:34:52,098 --> 00:34:56,283
I moved too fast,
the last push knocked you forward...

567
00:35:01,795 --> 00:35:03,863
And that's what broke my spine.

568
00:35:06,614 --> 00:35:10,459
Ian. What did you do to Angus?

569
00:35:10,459 --> 00:35:14,180
No, not that sweet kid.

570
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:18,801
Residue on Angus's body was elk skin.

571
00:35:18,801 --> 00:35:25,330
One of the uses besides motorcycle gloves
is firemmens gloves.

572
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,872
He came to me.

573
00:35:30,609 --> 00:35:33,964
I didn't go to him,
he came to me.

574
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:38,227
Coming up, we'll bring you
full coverage on the investigation

575
00:35:38,227 --> 00:35:40,589
in to the real Halloween killer,

576
00:35:40,589 --> 00:35:43,154
including a live update from
the Gray's Ferry neighborhood

577
00:35:43,154 --> 00:35:45,195
where the killer struck
just last night.

578
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,050
Angus. How was the movie?

579
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,552
I figured it out Ian.

580
00:36:00,552 --> 00:36:02,754
After the car flipped over,
Vicky was crying out,

581
00:36:02,754 --> 00:36:05,181
she said her leg hurt.
Her leg hurt!

582
00:36:05,181 --> 00:36:06,515
She was dellusional Angus,

583
00:36:06,515 --> 00:36:07,511
didn't know what was going on.

584
00:36:07,511 --> 00:36:10,038
Yes, she did.
She felt it, man.

585
00:36:10,038 --> 00:36:13,722
And I know all about the jaws of life
and how you messed up.

586
00:36:13,722 --> 00:36:16,664
You're nuts Angus now I've been
as nice to you as I can but

587
00:36:16,664 --> 00:36:17,914
I'm getting sick of it.

588
00:36:17,914 --> 00:36:18,989
Yeah, you are nice.

589
00:36:18,989 --> 00:36:20,905
Right off the bat
and you didn't even know me.

590
00:36:20,905 --> 00:36:23,149
No, it was like you didn't
blame me at all.

591
00:36:23,149 --> 00:36:25,036
Time to go home,
sleep it off butthead.

592
00:36:25,036 --> 00:36:26,913
You just went there out of guilt.

593
00:36:26,913 --> 00:36:28,600
I just want to be near her

594
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,864
but you want to ease
your consciense.

595
00:36:31,366 --> 00:36:34,208
Vicky and I can be
happy together.

596
00:36:35,634 --> 00:36:37,669
Just tell them what you did.

597
00:36:37,669 --> 00:36:40,459
Ian, she won't believe me
if I do it.

598
00:36:41,545 --> 00:36:44,952
I didn't do anything.

599
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,431
You're a total fraud.

600
00:36:46,431 --> 00:36:48,973
Everyone thinks
you're some big hero

601
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,470
but I'm gonna tell them the truth.

602
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,981
Look you little pissant,

603
00:36:51,981 --> 00:36:54,162
you crashed a car and
when you were crawling away

604
00:36:54,162 --> 00:36:56,617
on your hands and knees
I was saving a life.

605
00:36:56,617 --> 00:36:58,205
But you lied.

606
00:36:58,205 --> 00:37:00,355
And I'm gonna tell everybody
what you did.

607
00:37:00,355 --> 00:37:06,702
And then you're gonna know what it feels
like to be hate for one stupid mistake.

608
00:37:18,419 --> 00:37:21,169
The real Halloween killer is
still on the loose tonight.

609
00:37:21,169 --> 00:37:23,669
Police have launched a massive
search to find the man

610
00:37:23,669 --> 00:37:27,307
who stabbed and killed
a Grey's Ferry girl late last night.

611
00:37:27,307 --> 00:37:31,072
The witnesses reported that the man was
dressed as the main character

612
00:37:31,072 --> 00:37:33,225
in the slasher picture
The Halloween.

613
00:37:33,225 --> 00:37:38,117
Local groups have begun to call on
theaters to stop showing the film.

614
00:37:39,698 --> 00:37:42,442
