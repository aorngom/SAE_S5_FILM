00:00:00,181 --> 00:00:01,473
* 1, 2, 3, uh! *

2
00:00:01,473 --> 00:00:03,824
* My baby don't mess around me *

00:00:09,671 --> 00:00:12,124

* to see me walk out the do'*

7
00:00:17,877 --> 00:00:19,503
* Don't try to fight the feeling *

8
00:00:19,503 --> 00:00:21,894
Sweetheart?
* because the thought alone *

9
00:00:24,035 --> 00:00:25,996
I was, just, uh,
fixing my hair, pop.

10
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:29,431
You look different tonight.

11
00:00:30,357 --> 00:00:31,737
Nice, I mean.

12
00:00:33,086 --> 00:00:36,185
You sure Dirk's gonna be
at this party, sweetie?

13
00:00:36,185 --> 00:00:37,853
He's pledging the fraternity, pop.

14
00:00:37,853 --> 00:00:38,900
Of course he'll be there.

15
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,519
He hasn't been coming around
like he used to.

16
00:00:40,519 --> 00:00:41,807
You sure everything's
okay with him?

17
00:00:41,807 --> 00:00:43,401
Yeah, I'm sure.

18
00:00:43,401 --> 00:00:44,805
Look, I gotta go.

19
00:00:44,805 --> 00:00:47,275
Oh, uh, I wanted you to...

20
00:00:47,275 --> 00:00:48,969
have this.

21
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:51,868
Here, it was your mom's.

22
00:00:54,407 --> 00:00:58,163
You are a young lady now, sweetie.

23
00:00:58,981 --> 00:01:01,712
Okay, um...

24
00:01:01,712 --> 00:01:03,307
- Say "cheese".
- Cheese.

25
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:06,673
It's beautiful, pop.

26
00:01:07,174 --> 00:01:08,614
Just like you.

27
00:01:09,348 --> 00:01:10,676
Really?

28
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:12,979
You look just like your mom.

29
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:18,555
She would be so
proud of you, sweetie.

30
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,127
Get out of here!

31
00:02:01,657 --> 00:02:05,691
Decedent : Laurie Dunne
Cause of Death : Smoke Inhalation

32
00:02:10,028 --> 00:02:12,103
Laurie was in her
first year of college.

33
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,535
She always dreamed
of going to state.

34
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:16,606
Her and her friend
from the neighborhood, Dirk,

35
00:02:16,606 --> 00:02:18,059
that's all they ever talked about.

36
00:02:20,344 --> 00:02:23,781
And this friend was at the fraternity party
when the fire broke out?

37
00:02:23,781 --> 00:02:25,191
Nah, he was back at his dorm.

38
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:27,724
He'd passed out.
Tied on one too many.

39
00:02:27,724 --> 00:02:30,241
Said Laurie was having a real blast.

40
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:31,835
She wanted to stay.

41
00:02:32,664 --> 00:02:33,889
It was her first party.

42
00:02:34,495 --> 00:02:36,046
She was so excited.

43
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:37,586
Is that right?

44
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:40,316
Laurie's mom died
when she was 12.

45
00:02:41,908 --> 00:02:43,183
Cancer.

46
00:02:43,779 --> 00:02:45,312
She liked to stay home, mostly.

47
00:02:45,312 --> 00:02:47,859
Watch reruns with her old pop.

48
00:02:48,556 --> 00:02:51,161
This fire was an accident, Mr. Dunne.

49
00:02:51,161 --> 00:02:53,254
You, you know we work
homicides, right?

50
00:02:53,254 --> 00:02:54,951
I thought it was an accident, too.

51
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,271
Till I found this.

52
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,697
It's from Laurie's e-mail.

53
00:03:05,078 --> 00:03:06,905
From the night of the party.

54
00:03:06,905 --> 00:03:09,196
It says right there
the phone it came from.

55
00:03:09,196 --> 00:03:10,484
Laurie's cell phone.

56
00:03:10,484 --> 00:03:11,975
She had a, um

57
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:13,877
camera thingamajig on it.

58
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:16,925
So she sent this photo
to herself? /Yeah.

59
00:03:19,156 --> 00:03:24,442
The time and date was
October 23, 2004. 11:25 P.M.

60
00:03:25,244 --> 00:03:27,755
And 40 minutes later...

61
00:03:28,247 --> 00:03:30,063
my daughter was dead.

62
00:04:05,631 --> 00:04:09,078
The fire marshal said the blaze probably
started from a stray cigarette.

63
00:04:09,078 --> 00:04:10,690
No accelerants found.

64
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,488
Cause of death was smoke inhalation.

65
00:04:12,488 --> 00:04:15,057
Blood alcohol level .22.

66
00:04:15,057 --> 00:04:16,980
Thought dad said Laurie
wasn't a partier.

67
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,907
She wasn't.
Straight-A student, latin major,

68
00:04:19,907 --> 00:04:23,568
a city council summer intern.
Straight-up nerd.

69
00:04:23,568 --> 00:04:26,534
That amount of booze would've
knocked her flat on her back.

70
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,564
Everyone else gets out but her.

71
00:04:28,564 --> 00:04:30,027
Heading out?

72
00:04:30,027 --> 00:04:32,096
Early bird catches the slimebag.

73
00:04:32,096 --> 00:04:33,479
Who you starting with?

74
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:35,958
Dirk Bryant, fellow freshman,
Gamma-Rho pledge.

75
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,932
Claims he left the house an hour
before the fire started.

76
00:04:38,932 --> 00:04:40,789
Dad said he and this
Laurie were friends.

77
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:42,631
Since childhood. Best buddies.

78
00:04:42,631 --> 00:04:43,763
We'll check in with AV.

79
00:04:43,763 --> 00:04:45,467
See how they're doing
on our laptop photo.

80
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:46,752
Who's coming to first Thursdays?

81
00:04:46,752 --> 00:04:48,693
- I'm in.
- Ditto.

82
00:04:48,693 --> 00:04:50,362
What's first Thursdays?

83
00:04:50,362 --> 00:04:51,913
We taking your ride or mine?

84
00:04:51,913 --> 00:04:54,286
Mine. Catch you later.

85
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:57,773
Think he's warming up to me.

86
00:05:06,702 --> 00:05:08,855
Looks like you got a crush
on the new girl.

87
00:05:09,756 --> 00:05:11,871
Yeah, Cupid pierced my heart.

88
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:14,600
Oh, this our guy?

89
00:05:18,798 --> 00:05:20,173
Dirk Bryant?

90
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:22,967
Yeah?

91
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:26,222
Philly homicide.
Detective Rush, Vera.

92
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:28,262
Homicide?

93
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:29,709
You're kidding, right?

94
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:31,287
You know anything about this, Dirk?

95
00:05:32,772 --> 00:05:35,417
Picture sent from Laurie Dunne's
cell phone night she died.

96
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:36,775
From inside your fraternity house.

97
00:05:36,775 --> 00:05:39,274
We're wondering who might
have done this. Any ideas?

98
00:05:39,274 --> 00:05:41,508
- No way.
- Sure about that?

99
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,378
Look, I was bombed
out of my skull that night.

100
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:46,647
I went back to my dorm room,
passed out.

101
00:05:47,121 --> 00:05:48,703
My roommate can back that up.

102
00:05:48,703 --> 00:05:51,111
When's the last time
you saw Laurie? / At the party.

103
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:53,705
She wanted to stay.
She was drinking, having a ball.

104
00:05:53,705 --> 00:05:55,765
Yeah. Sure looks like it.

105
00:05:55,765 --> 00:05:58,381
Listen. I didn't even invite her to
that party in the first place.

106
00:05:58,381 --> 00:05:59,613
What do you mean?

107
00:06:00,798 --> 00:06:02,922
Laurie basically invited herself.

108
00:06:04,988 --> 00:06:06,891
You want to be a Gamma-Rho brother,

109
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,769
you talk, walk, blink and breathe
when we say you do.

110
00:06:12,404 --> 00:06:15,011
- You get me, pledges?
- Sir, yes, sir.

111
00:06:16,868 --> 00:06:19,668
You.
Sit down.

112
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:25,713
Eat.

113
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:28,467
No hands.

114
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,253
Hiya, Dirk.

115
00:06:37,743 --> 00:06:39,062
What are you doing?

116
00:06:39,517 --> 00:06:41,540
Aren't you gonna
introduce your friend, Dirk?

117
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:45,052
Um, this is Laurie.

118
00:06:45,737 --> 00:06:47,385
And that's, uh...

119
00:06:47,385 --> 00:06:49,142
my friend, Dierdre.

120
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:52,230
We met in foreign
film club. / Hi.

121
00:06:53,016 --> 00:06:55,606
I'm gonna go sit over there.

122
00:06:55,606 --> 00:06:58,280
Um, so anyway,
this Saturday night,

123
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,826
the film club's showing
a Bergman double feature,

124
00:07:00,826 --> 00:07:03,822
Autumn sonata and
cries and whispers.

125
00:07:03,822 --> 00:07:05,463
Be there or be square.

126
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,370
Want to come?
Old time's sake?

127
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,992
Unfortunately,
Dirk is committed that night.

128
00:07:14,992 --> 00:07:17,306
It's alum weekend and
the house is throwing a party.

129
00:07:17,306 --> 00:07:19,086
Everyone's invited.

130
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,715
Dirk didn't invite you?

131
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:26,348
Um...
I guess I forgot.

132
00:07:26,348 --> 00:07:28,653
I accept the invitation.

133
00:07:28,653 --> 00:07:31,198
Film club, what film club?

134
00:07:32,891 --> 00:07:35,267
It's gonna be mad fun, Laurie.

135
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:37,064
Bring your cute friend, too.

136
00:07:43,433 --> 00:07:44,584
Laurie kind of jumped the gun.

137
00:07:44,584 --> 00:07:47,112
So this friend of Laurie's
was at the party, too?

138
00:07:47,524 --> 00:07:48,735
Yeah.

139
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,271
Know where we can find her?

140
00:07:51,464 --> 00:07:54,442
Uh, Laurie and I
kind of drifted apart here.

141
00:07:54,442 --> 00:07:56,886
I didn't know her friends,
she didn't know mine.

142
00:07:56,886 --> 00:07:59,617
How'd Laurie take it,
your drifting apart?

143
00:08:00,308 --> 00:08:01,522
Things change.

144
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,450
What're you gonna do?

145
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,939
You mean you changed.

146
00:08:04,596 --> 00:08:05,929
That a crime?

147
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:08,222
Wanting the highlight of
my Saturday night

148
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:12,052
to be more than reading
foreign film subtitles?

149
00:08:16,402 --> 00:08:18,647
So um...

150
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,938
pretty young to make
homicide. / I'm 28.

151
00:08:21,938 --> 00:08:24,368
Yeah, but you got
your family connection.

152
00:08:25,413 --> 00:08:26,821
How old were you?

153
00:08:27,368 --> 00:08:30,374
I was practically 29.

154
00:08:32,734 --> 00:08:35,496
Sure, I remember
those bozo frat boys.

155
00:08:35,496 --> 00:08:37,047
Real jerks.

156
00:08:41,693 --> 00:08:44,100
You see anything at the party
you want to share?

157
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,257
Anything like what?

158
00:08:48,964 --> 00:08:50,592
Like this.

159
00:08:50,592 --> 00:08:52,928
Could be what happened to Laurie
wasn't an accident.

160
00:08:53,546 --> 00:08:55,806
Anything you want to share now?

161
00:08:55,806 --> 00:08:56,985
She was your friend, Dierdre.

162
00:08:56,985 --> 00:08:58,405
Help us out here.

163
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:03,166
They blindfolded us.

164
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:06,061
What?

165
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:07,824
The minute we went in.

166
00:09:07,824 --> 00:09:09,947
They said we couldn't see

167
00:09:09,947 --> 00:09:12,891
where their stupid secret room was.

168
00:09:12,891 --> 00:09:15,269
Where the real party would take place.

169
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,725
Only brothers could.

170
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:19,442
And you went along with this.

171
00:09:20,266 --> 00:09:22,518
I bought a new dress for this party.

172
00:09:22,518 --> 00:09:24,580
What happened
after they blindfolded you?

173
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,168
The fun and games began.

174
00:09:31,898 --> 00:09:34,988
Avril LavigneÀÇ 'Skater Boy'

175
00:09:36,183 --> 00:09:39,277
* He was a boy, she was a girl *

176
00:09:39,277 --> 00:09:42,593
* Can I make it anymore obvious? *

177
00:09:42,593 --> 00:09:46,053
* He was a punk, she did ballet *

178
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:49,026
* What more can I say? *

179
00:09:49,026 --> 00:09:51,109
* He wanted her, she'd never tell *

180
00:09:51,109 --> 00:09:52,362
Why they gotta be
blindfolded, Manny?

181
00:09:52,362 --> 00:09:55,044
You know the rules. No one
but us sees the way to the pen.

182
00:09:55,044 --> 00:09:57,571
The pen? / That's what we call
our party room, darling.

183
00:09:57,571 --> 00:09:59,245
It's okay, Dirk.

184
00:09:59,245 --> 00:10:00,628
It's kind of fun.

185
00:10:00,628 --> 00:10:02,946
You sure you're okay,
Laurie? / Yeah.

186
00:10:02,946 --> 00:10:04,661
Welcome to the pen, girls.

187
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:10,890
- Can I take off my blindfold now?
- Oh, no, no.

188
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,545
Not just yet, hon.
We got to introduce you formally first.

189
00:10:13,545 --> 00:10:14,779
Think cotillion.

190
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:17,245
Cotillion? What'that?

191
00:10:17,245 --> 00:10:19,383
May I present...

192
00:10:19,383 --> 00:10:22,820
miss Dierdre Miller, gentlemen!

193
00:10:24,147 --> 00:10:25,182
Come on, step up, honey.

194
00:10:25,182 --> 00:10:27,248
Just got a little platform
for your presentation.

195
00:10:28,081 --> 00:10:29,026
Whoopsie daisy!

196
00:10:29,026 --> 00:10:30,813
Manny, this isn't right.

197
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,317
All right?

198
00:10:37,025 --> 00:10:40,004
And last but not least,

199
00:10:40,004 --> 00:10:43,660
may I present...
miss Laurie Dunne!

200
00:10:47,112 --> 00:10:48,999
Step up again.

201
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:56,759
You can take the blindfolds
off now, ladies.

202
00:11:06,455 --> 00:11:09,497
Damn, you!
You tipped the scale!

203
00:11:11,896 --> 00:11:14,778
Gamma-Rho dubs you,
miss Laurie Dunne.

204
00:11:15,277 --> 00:11:17,308
Queen of the porkers!

205
00:11:19,858 --> 00:11:21,893
Welcome to the pig pen, porkies!

206
00:11:24,793 --> 00:11:27,389
Get your fat asses back in here.
The party's just started!

207
00:11:28,578 --> 00:11:30,796
I didn't know.
Laurie, I didn't.

208
00:11:32,286 --> 00:11:34,688
Whoa. We're not done
with you yet, little piggy.

209
00:11:34,688 --> 00:11:36,965
No! Stop it!

210
00:11:38,374 --> 00:11:39,977
We all got out of there.

211
00:11:39,977 --> 00:11:41,383
Except for Laurie.

212
00:11:42,392 --> 00:11:44,703
So why the big secret, Dierdre?

213
00:11:45,436 --> 00:11:48,378
Would you want the world to know
what they did to you?

214
00:11:49,595 --> 00:11:52,096
I'm sorry about what
happened to Laurie,

215
00:11:52,848 --> 00:11:54,645
but it was an accident.

216
00:11:56,057 --> 00:11:57,661
Some accident.

217
00:12:06,072 --> 00:12:09,892
So our prince charmings put those
poor girls on display for laughs.

218
00:12:09,892 --> 00:12:12,748
Laurie's friend, Dirk,
he was a part of this ruse, too?

219
00:12:12,748 --> 00:12:14,065
The kid was a lowly pledge.

220
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:15,679
Seemed clueless
to what was going down.

221
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:18,041
He's Gamma-Rho,
faithful to the brotherhood,

222
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,055
so let's go back for round two.

223
00:12:19,055 --> 00:12:21,141
Meantime, what do you know
about this Manny?

224
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:25,214
College boy, did six months in county
for aggravated assault.

225
00:12:25,214 --> 00:12:27,407
Beating on some townies.
On probation now.

226
00:12:27,407 --> 00:12:29,633
Vera and Valens are having a talk.

227
00:12:30,028 --> 00:12:31,282
Lieutenant?

228
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:33,518
Find anything on that laptop, Naya?

229
00:12:33,518 --> 00:12:34,961
We blew up your victim's photo.

230
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:36,806
Guy with the bottle's got
a fraternity ring,

231
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:38,074
Gamma-Rho insignia.

232
00:12:38,074 --> 00:12:40,081
Graduation year 1973.

233
00:12:40,081 --> 00:12:42,114
Making our boy what, mid-50s?

234
00:12:42,114 --> 00:12:44,189
Middle aged and partying
with college kids?

235
00:12:44,189 --> 00:12:46,030
That's aging gracefully.

236
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,366
What's with the gemstones?

237
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:48,606
Well, maybe he's a varsity athlete.

238
00:12:48,606 --> 00:12:50,497
Gamma-Rho's known for its crew types.

239
00:12:50,497 --> 00:12:52,121
'93 grad myself.

240
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:54,326
So one stone for every varsity year?

241
00:12:54,326 --> 00:12:56,090
I'll be at the athletic department call.

242
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,473
Match a '73 grad who had
three years of varsity

243
00:12:58,473 --> 00:13:00,695
with our Gamma-Rho alum lists.

244
00:13:00,695 --> 00:13:02,604
Maybe we find our party boy.

245
00:13:14,097 --> 00:13:16,670
- This Gamma-Rho?
- Sir, yes, sir!

246
00:13:17,976 --> 00:13:20,445
We're looking for a Herman Jones.

247
00:13:21,203 --> 00:13:22,961
Please step inside, sirs!

248
00:13:26,422 --> 00:13:29,194
Sir? Guests for you, sir!

249
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,510
Herman Jones?

250
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,539
What's it to you?

251
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,996
- And it's Manny.
- Yeah, whatever.

252
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,061
Philly PD.

253
00:13:42,057 --> 00:13:44,124
Quit gawking, pledge.
Get out of here.

254
00:13:46,004 --> 00:13:47,461
He's cute.

255
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:50,031
French maids do it for me, too.

256
00:13:50,031 --> 00:13:51,866
How we discipline the newbies,

257
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:53,377
break theem down.

258
00:13:54,603 --> 00:13:55,855
And you are?

259
00:13:55,855 --> 00:13:58,152
Detective Valens, Vera.

260
00:13:58,152 --> 00:14:01,039
Got some questions about the night
Laurie Dunne died.

261
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,342
Well, fire away, so to speak.

262
00:14:05,342 --> 00:14:08,836
Heard about your hogscale party.
Class act there, Herman.

263
00:14:08,836 --> 00:14:11,993
Not my fault the heifer had dreams.

264
00:14:14,365 --> 00:14:15,870
Dreams?

265
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,534
Of being a Gamma-Rho booty call.

266
00:14:18,534 --> 00:14:20,505
Hey, Scotty,
you know a Jimmy Davis?

267
00:14:20,505 --> 00:14:22,852
It's a probation officer. Sure.

268
00:14:22,852 --> 00:14:24,269
He and I went to the academy together.

269
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:25,474
We're kind of like brothers.

270
00:14:25,474 --> 00:14:27,042
Davis knows I been dotting my I's.

271
00:14:27,042 --> 00:14:28,857
Maybe jimmy finds out
you missed a "T,"

272
00:14:28,857 --> 00:14:30,616
tosses your ass back in county.

273
00:14:30,616 --> 00:14:32,938
You get to play
French maid for the cons.

274
00:14:38,642 --> 00:14:41,387
So what happened after you
dragged Laurie back into the pen?

275
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,271
It was a joke, okay?

276
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,702
I didn't do anything
to that pork pie.

277
00:14:48,702 --> 00:14:50,253
Tell us about it.

278
00:14:50,253 --> 00:14:51,928
Girlfriend went ballistic.

279
00:14:54,073 --> 00:14:55,957
We're not done with
you yet, little piggy!

280
00:15:04,051 --> 00:15:05,737
You four-eyed loser!

281
00:15:06,466 --> 00:15:08,763
That's what the jocks
used to call you in high school!

282
00:15:08,763 --> 00:15:11,887
- Or don't you remember?
- For real?

283
00:15:11,887 --> 00:15:14,751
I'm not talking to you,
so shut the hell up!

284
00:15:18,107 --> 00:15:21,596
You think getting contacts
changes who you were?

285
00:15:22,271 --> 00:15:24,503
makes you their friend now?

286
00:15:25,032 --> 00:15:27,033
their brother?

287
00:15:27,697 --> 00:15:30,027
You used to hate guys like this,

288
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:33,285
guys who beat you up
in gym class every day.

289
00:15:35,036 --> 00:15:36,797
You were better than them.

290
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:40,271
Because you didn't need
to make others feel small,

291
00:15:41,352 --> 00:15:43,177
to feel real.

292
00:15:44,273 --> 00:15:45,836
But you know what?

293
00:15:46,711 --> 00:15:48,900
You're that guy now, Dirk.

294
00:15:50,223 --> 00:15:51,765
You're that guy.

295
00:16:08,028 --> 00:16:09,793
I know who you are.

296
00:16:13,034 --> 00:16:14,502
Dierdre?

297
00:16:15,271 --> 00:16:16,650
What happened?

298
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:19,249
Come on, let's get out of here.

299
00:16:29,893 --> 00:16:32,753
Like I said,
fatty got emotional.

300
00:16:32,753 --> 00:16:34,676
So Dierdre was still in the house?

301
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:37,097
Whatever yes. So what?

302
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:41,540
What did Laurie mean by, "I know who
you are" to the older guy?

303
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,389
Who the hell knows?

304
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:43,348
It was alum weekend.

305
00:16:43,348 --> 00:16:44,639
A lot of people were there.

306
00:16:45,187 --> 00:16:47,255
I don't know who
that old warthog was.

307
00:16:51,741 --> 00:16:53,042
Why'd you lie, Dierdre?

308
00:16:53,611 --> 00:16:55,936
Say you left when you were
still in the house?

309
00:16:59,302 --> 00:17:00,822
Tell them, Dierdre.

310
00:17:01,408 --> 00:17:03,413
Someone should know
what happened to you.

311
00:17:04,414 --> 00:17:06,486
I bought that new dress.

312
00:17:08,017 --> 00:17:10,508
- And he ripped it.
- Who did?

313
00:17:14,379 --> 00:17:16,566
Look, I need to make a call.

314
00:17:19,261 --> 00:17:20,933
Who hurt you, Dierdre?

315
00:17:21,516 --> 00:17:23,205
It was dark.

316
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:28,737
I was trying to find
a way out of that house,

317
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:33,258
but there were so many rooms,

318
00:17:34,128 --> 00:17:35,991
and then someone just grabs me

319
00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:38,947
from out of nowhere
and rips my dress.

320
00:17:40,175 --> 00:17:42,828
It was over before I could
even scream.

321
00:17:44,925 --> 00:17:48,284
I tried to find my way out of
that house, but I couldn't.

322
00:17:48,284 --> 00:17:50,752
That's when Laurie
found you in that hallway.

323
00:17:50,752 --> 00:17:52,302
Laurie got me out of that house.

324
00:17:54,292 --> 00:17:57,150
But then she turned traitor.

325
00:17:58,915 --> 00:18:02,029
Are you okay, Dierdre? / No.

326
00:18:02,772 --> 00:18:04,950
She's not okay.

327
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,960
Laurie?
Can I talk to you, please?

328
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,783
Get away from us, you jerk!

329
00:18:10,783 --> 00:18:12,608
I didn't know they were
gonna do that! I swear!

330
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:15,569
You're pathetic if you
listen to one word he says.

331
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:17,178
How could you not know, Dirk?

332
00:18:17,178 --> 00:18:19,508
They don't tell pledges anything.
/ Yeah, right!

333
00:18:19,508 --> 00:18:20,889
I'd never let you come if I knew!

334
00:18:20,889 --> 00:18:23,247
You're a lying piece of crap!

335
00:18:23,247 --> 00:18:25,079
Give me two minutes,
Laurie, please!

336
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:25,972
I have to talk to you!

337
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,797
She doesn't care
what you have to say!

338
00:18:27,797 --> 00:18:29,419
Dierdre, he's my friend.

339
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:31,584
Don't you get it?

340
00:18:31,584 --> 00:18:34,045
You're nothing to him!

341
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,319
I want to hear
what he has to say.

342
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,571
What did you do?

343
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:55,826
We went straight home.

344
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,740
We tried to pretend
it never happened.

345
00:18:59,543 --> 00:19:02,234
Jo?
Got something.

346
00:19:08,504 --> 00:19:09,745
Just talked to Stillman.

347
00:19:09,745 --> 00:19:11,607
I.D'ed the guy in the picture shoving

348
00:19:11,607 --> 00:19:13,475
the tequila bottle down Laurie's throat.

349
00:19:13,475 --> 00:19:14,550
The Gamma-Rho alum?

350
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:18,104
Class of '73,
three years varsity crew.

351
00:19:18,104 --> 00:19:19,668
One guy makes the grade.

352
00:19:19,668 --> 00:19:21,084
You're not gonna
believe who it is.

353
00:19:21,084 --> 00:19:22,761
Don't keep me hanging.

354
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,650
The name john avery ring any bells?

355
00:19:25,551 --> 00:19:29,322
City councilman John Avery? / Bingo.

356
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,949
A rumor has it, this councilman
Avery's a real hounddog.

357
00:19:39,949 --> 00:19:42,283
Can't keep his paws off
the female interns.

358
00:19:42,283 --> 00:19:44,398
That's how Laurie knew him,
her summer internship.

359
00:19:44,398 --> 00:19:46,178
And in October of 2004,

360
00:19:46,178 --> 00:19:48,986
Avery was in the middle
of a reelection campaign.

361
00:19:48,986 --> 00:19:51,502
If his joining in the Gamma-Rho
activities ever came to light,

362
00:19:51,502 --> 00:19:52,988
he'd be kissing
his career bye-bye.

363
00:19:52,988 --> 00:19:55,099
So maybe Laurie's death
wasn't accidental.

364
00:19:55,099 --> 00:19:57,704
- Maybe the fire was a cover-up.
- Lot of maybes.

365
00:19:57,704 --> 00:20:00,589
Too many for us to make that kind
of accusation against a councilman.

366
00:20:00,589 --> 00:20:03,565
What if Dirk gave us
a positive ID on him?

367
00:20:03,565 --> 00:20:07,223
Good luck getting any cooperation
from your frat boys. / Why?

368
00:20:07,223 --> 00:20:09,349
Gamma-Rho's closing ranks.

369
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:11,082
Slimebag lawyer just got involved.

370
00:20:11,082 --> 00:20:12,193
That was quick.

371
00:20:12,193 --> 00:20:15,295
Apparently that psycho kid, Manny,
me and Scotty talked to?

372
00:20:15,295 --> 00:20:18,290
went squealing to
his brothers right after. / Great.

373
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,796
Laurie's dad mentioned some kind
of letter the councilman sent him,

374
00:20:20,796 --> 00:20:22,943
right after she died.

375
00:20:22,943 --> 00:20:24,560
Could be doer's remorse?

376
00:20:29,841 --> 00:20:32,610
What's councilman Avery's letter
got to do with what happened to Laurie?

377
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,015
Well, we need to look at everything.

378
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:35,633
Part of the job, Mr. Dunne.

379
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:38,184
Avery ever reach out to you again,
after sending the letter?

380
00:20:38,184 --> 00:20:40,981
No. I, I don't know,
not that I can recall.

381
00:20:40,981 --> 00:20:42,315
What about Dirk?

382
00:20:42,315 --> 00:20:44,380
Dirk? What about him?

383
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,151
He keep in touch?

384
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:49,018
Comes over for a meal
once a week.

385
00:20:49,018 --> 00:20:51,935
We, uh, watch some TV, talk.

386
00:20:51,935 --> 00:20:53,272
It's nice.

387
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,068
Him coming here like that, it's...

388
00:20:56,068 --> 00:20:57,824
keeps my mind off things.

389
00:20:57,824 --> 00:20:58,830
That's admirable.

390
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,684
Especially from someone
as young as him.

391
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:03,758
He's a special kid.

392
00:21:04,928 --> 00:21:06,444
Why are you asking about him?

393
00:21:07,013 --> 00:21:10,601
Dirk and Laurie, you knew they
were growing apart at college.

394
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:11,488
What's your meaning?

395
00:21:11,488 --> 00:21:14,544
He had a whole other crowd
he was trying to get in with.

396
00:21:15,044 --> 00:21:16,880
No. You don't know him.

397
00:21:20,649 --> 00:21:23,676
The day I told Laurie that...

398
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,141
her mom wasn't coming
back from the hospital...

399
00:21:27,848 --> 00:21:29,167
not one tear.

400
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,198
Not that day.

401
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:34,358
- Not ever.
- Brave girl.

402
00:21:34,804 --> 00:21:36,371
12 years old.

403
00:21:36,371 --> 00:21:38,371
Only thing holding me down to earth.

404
00:21:38,371 --> 00:21:39,961
Is that right?

405
00:21:40,745 --> 00:21:42,694
One night, I can't sleep.

406
00:21:42,694 --> 00:21:44,465
I come down here...

407
00:21:45,755 --> 00:21:47,740
and I hear my daughter crying.

408
00:21:48,591 --> 00:21:51,278
That's when I see Dirk,
just a kid, too.

409
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:53,685
Got Laurie in his arms.

410
00:21:54,257 --> 00:21:55,793
And that's when I knew...

411
00:21:56,632 --> 00:21:58,484
he was the only thing

412
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,027
holding her down to earth.

413
00:22:04,984 --> 00:22:08,006
So...
you want tell me

414
00:22:08,006 --> 00:22:09,677
what happened to my girl now?

415
00:22:11,225 --> 00:22:13,273
What makes you ask me about Dirk?

416
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,642
Nice kid.

417
00:22:22,235 --> 00:22:24,460
Spending time with the dead
friend's father.

418
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,434
- That's commitment.
- Or guilt.

419
00:22:27,561 --> 00:22:29,115
My lawyer said you can't talk to me.

420
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:33,581
From the minute your brother Manny knows
we're opening this case, he tells everyone.

421
00:22:33,581 --> 00:22:36,103
You knew way before Manny did,
and you never told a soul.

422
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,078
Why'd you bring Laurie back
into that house?

423
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,021
Because she bitch-slapped you
in front of your boys?

424
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:44,209
Maybe you were looking
to settle the score.

425
00:22:44,209 --> 00:22:45,836
Or maybe you were following orders.

426
00:22:46,382 --> 00:22:49,497
Laurie recognizes councilman Avery,
leaves him no choice.

427
00:22:49,497 --> 00:22:51,548
He sends his errand boy
to bring her back.

428
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,266
Nobody made me do
anything that night.

429
00:22:56,351 --> 00:22:57,995
No one but me.

430
00:23:01,684 --> 00:23:04,337
So what's so important
you want talk to me about?

431
00:23:05,898 --> 00:23:07,725
I'm sorry.

432
00:23:07,725 --> 00:23:08,879
That's it?

433
00:23:10,035 --> 00:23:12,437
That's all you have
to say for yourself?

434
00:23:13,466 --> 00:23:15,197
That's not good enough.

435
00:23:17,018 --> 00:23:18,657
In your kitchen....

436
00:23:20,619 --> 00:23:23,933
after your mom died.

437
00:23:24,427 --> 00:23:26,480
What?

438
00:23:27,654 --> 00:23:29,674
I remember watching you cry.

439
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:33,024
Why are you telling me this?

440
00:23:33,024 --> 00:23:34,531
And I remember...

441
00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:37,853
thinking we were just 12, you know?

442
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:44,319
But that was over, being kids.

443
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:47,596
Because that night...

444
00:23:48,358 --> 00:23:51,404
I knew I had to be the one
person you could always...

445
00:23:52,824 --> 00:23:54,602
count on.

446
00:23:56,055 --> 00:23:57,949
You always were.

447
00:24:00,621 --> 00:24:02,543
Not tonight.

448
00:24:29,061 --> 00:24:30,362
What the hell's going on?

449
00:24:36,494 --> 00:24:37,918
You boinking the oink, Dirk?

450
00:24:38,338 --> 00:24:40,447
- Let's get of here.
- Dudes!

451
00:24:40,447 --> 00:24:43,744
Dirk's rounded up
our little porker!

452
00:24:43,744 --> 00:24:44,795
Don't call her that.

453
00:24:44,795 --> 00:24:46,646
Shut up, dork boy.

454
00:24:47,467 --> 00:24:49,095
- Come on!
- Stop it.

455
00:24:49,095 --> 00:24:50,794
Hey, you leave her alone!

456
00:24:54,307 --> 00:24:55,518
Back to the pen!

457
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,491
Time for the greased pig contest!

458
00:24:57,491 --> 00:25:01,085
What? No! Stop it!
Dirk!

459
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,528
Laurie!

460
00:25:18,668 --> 00:25:20,415
And you call these
guys your brothers?

461
00:25:21,502 --> 00:25:22,844
They're not always like that.

462
00:25:22,844 --> 00:25:26,084
So councilman Avery's in the house.

463
00:25:28,755 --> 00:25:30,412
What'd you do, after that?

464
00:25:31,837 --> 00:25:33,460
Like I said,
I went back to my dorm.

465
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,874
Didn't occur to you
to call the cops, go for help?

466
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,516
I was out of it.
Didn't know what to do.

467
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:42,194
Friend like you,

468
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,249
who needs enemies?

469
00:25:54,284 --> 00:25:57,823
The meet with Avery's set
for tomorrow morning in his office.

470
00:25:57,823 --> 00:26:00,328
The guy has no idea how you're
gonna rock his world.

471
00:26:00,328 --> 00:26:03,165
I'd pay good money to be
a fly on that wall.

472
00:26:03,165 --> 00:26:05,219
Good work today, guys.
Good night.

473
00:26:05,219 --> 00:26:06,402
Good night, boss.

474
00:26:07,969 --> 00:26:10,773
Older, powerful men like Avery,
they can be a bitch.

475
00:26:12,267 --> 00:26:13,651
What do you mean?

476
00:26:14,298 --> 00:26:15,446
Nothing.

477
00:26:16,249 --> 00:26:18,443
So what's first Thursdays?

478
00:26:19,213 --> 00:26:21,898
Uh, Jones tavern, first
Thursday of the month.

479
00:26:21,898 --> 00:26:25,332
Homicide detectives boozing it up,
swapping war stories.

480
00:26:26,138 --> 00:26:27,269
You want to join?

481
00:26:28,242 --> 00:26:31,075
Nah. I'm not one for mixing work
with the personal myself.

482
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:33,560
Oh, me neither.

483
00:26:34,502 --> 00:26:35,865
Did that once before.

484
00:26:37,068 --> 00:26:40,105
It was a big mistake. / Yeah?

485
00:26:40,105 --> 00:26:43,131
I'm meaning, I'd understand if...

486
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,666
you found yourself
in a similar situation.

487
00:26:46,612 --> 00:26:48,736
Your old boss, sergeant White...

488
00:26:48,736 --> 00:26:49,952
Anyway, this is me.

489
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:55,503
- Nice ride.
- Yeah.

490
00:26:55,503 --> 00:26:56,845
It's four doors.

491
00:26:58,585 --> 00:26:59,617
Good night, Scotty.

492
00:27:08,888 --> 00:27:11,354
Laurie Dunne was
a summer intern in my office.

493
00:27:12,102 --> 00:27:13,481
Sweet girl.

494
00:27:14,575 --> 00:27:16,419
A terrible accident that fire.

495
00:27:19,991 --> 00:27:23,737
The thing is, councilman, we're not
convinced it was an accident.

496
00:27:25,184 --> 00:27:27,447
And we know you were there
the night she died.

497
00:27:29,652 --> 00:27:31,748
You're not serious, are you?

498
00:27:31,748 --> 00:27:32,964
We have a witness.

499
00:27:35,025 --> 00:27:36,635
One phone call from me, pal,

500
00:27:36,635 --> 00:27:38,452
you'll be running
the auto pound tomorrow.

501
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:47,093
And you'll be headline news, pal.

502
00:27:57,196 --> 00:27:58,322
What do you want?

503
00:27:59,735 --> 00:28:02,421
What'd your Gamma-Rho brothers
do to Laurie that night?

504
00:28:03,861 --> 00:28:07,668
Boys, booze and bravado,
a lethal combination.

505
00:28:07,668 --> 00:28:09,668
That poor girl was
caught in the vortex.

506
00:28:09,668 --> 00:28:11,263
And you were just
the wide-eyed innocent,

507
00:28:11,263 --> 00:28:12,582
watching it all go down.

508
00:28:12,582 --> 00:28:14,206
I had some drinks, I admit.

509
00:28:14,552 --> 00:28:16,337
But I knew when enough was enough.

510
00:28:18,109 --> 00:28:22,684
Swill! Swill! Swill!
Swill! Swill!

511
00:28:23,725 --> 00:28:25,775
Oh, piggy got you good, Manny!

512
00:28:26,852 --> 00:28:28,482
I'll show you a real man, porky!

513
00:28:35,102 --> 00:28:37,523
- She's taking pictures, dude!
- Get away from me!

514
00:28:37,523 --> 00:28:39,476
- She just took a picture!
- Get away from me!

515
00:28:40,784 --> 00:28:42,343
Give it back, you jerk!

516
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,429
She's taking pictures?

517
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:49,468
- So what? I took care of it!
- And I emailed it.

518
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,560
- You stupid!
- Leave her alone, Manny!

519
00:28:53,951 --> 00:28:55,925
Party's over, as of now.

520
00:28:56,497 --> 00:28:58,882
Get out of here!
All of you!

521
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:01,475
Go!

522
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:06,172
What about her?

523
00:29:10,513 --> 00:29:11,816
Get her home.

524
00:29:13,021 --> 00:29:14,662
I don't care how.

525
00:29:23,198 --> 00:29:24,985
That girl was alive when I left.

526
00:29:28,081 --> 00:29:30,119
She could have
blackmailed you, councilman,

527
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:31,445
and you just walked away?

528
00:29:31,445 --> 00:29:33,370
What do you honestly think I'd do?

529
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:36,701
- Kill the girl?
- Someone did.

530
00:29:36,701 --> 00:29:39,217
There were witnesses
who saw me leave that house.

531
00:29:39,217 --> 00:29:41,079
Your fraternity brothers, councilman?

532
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:41,970
A jury would love that.

533
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,467
I'm not talking about them.

534
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:45,175
Then who?

535
00:29:47,929 --> 00:29:49,275
Those girls...

536
00:29:50,598 --> 00:29:53,759
From earlier that night.

537
00:29:54,474 --> 00:29:57,122
- What girls?
- From the, you know?

538
00:29:58,189 --> 00:29:59,696
The contest.

539
00:30:01,373 --> 00:30:04,356
Wait a minute. Those girls were
still in the house?

540
00:30:04,356 --> 00:30:05,705
In the backyard.

541
00:30:06,362 --> 00:30:07,899
What were they doing there?

542
00:30:08,427 --> 00:30:10,443
They were setting the fire.

543
00:30:15,974 --> 00:30:18,006
You and your friends
set that fire, Shirley.

544
00:30:18,006 --> 00:30:19,047
That's crazy.

545
00:30:19,047 --> 00:30:20,464
We have a witness.

546
00:30:20,464 --> 00:30:22,014
Saw it all go down.

547
00:30:23,226 --> 00:30:25,620
I got your buddy, Dierdre,
in the next room.

548
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,965
She's blaming it all on you.

549
00:30:27,303 --> 00:30:29,156
You're lying.
She would never do that.

550
00:30:29,156 --> 00:30:32,406
Oh, people do all sorts of things
looking at life for murder one.

551
00:30:36,142 --> 00:30:37,933
Laurie stood up for you.

552
00:30:39,354 --> 00:30:40,869
Do the same for her, Shirley.

553
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:52,095
Those boys had no right
to do what they did to us.

554
00:30:52,775 --> 00:30:55,382
It made you mad./ No.

555
00:30:57,327 --> 00:30:59,004
It just...

556
00:31:00,783 --> 00:31:02,421
it kind of broke my heart.

557
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:05,331
Then why burn down the house?

558
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,515
To break theirs.

559
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,940
I can't believe those guys.

560
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,264
Let's go home.

561
00:31:15,264 --> 00:31:16,745
And do what?

562
00:31:16,745 --> 00:31:19,481
Cry ourselves to sleep
like we always do?

563
00:31:21,234 --> 00:31:23,362
Not after what they did to us.

564
00:31:24,617 --> 00:31:26,205
What they did to Dierdre.

565
00:31:26,205 --> 00:31:27,162
So what do you suggest?

566
00:31:27,162 --> 00:31:29,693
Tell the whole world,
so we'll be a laughingstock?

567
00:31:30,745 --> 00:31:32,290
We're not gonna tell anybody.

568
00:31:32,771 --> 00:31:35,820
We're just gonna...
get even.

569
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,336
Break up their stupid party.

570
00:31:42,465 --> 00:31:44,259
Burn the house down!

571
00:31:45,628 --> 00:31:47,061
I'm in.

572
00:31:53,477 --> 00:31:55,075
Shirley?

573
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,314
Burn it down!

574
00:32:09,314 --> 00:32:11,626
Are you okay, Dierdre?

575
00:32:11,626 --> 00:32:15,220
No, she's not okay.

576
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:19,014
Laurie?
Can I talk to you please?

577
00:32:21,264 --> 00:32:23,462
You know the rest of the story.

578
00:32:23,829 --> 00:32:25,996
Laurie went back
in the house with him.

579
00:32:27,058 --> 00:32:28,587
So...

580
00:32:31,235 --> 00:32:36,163
maybe you figured the traitor
deserved to burn up, too? /No.

581
00:32:36,782 --> 00:32:38,989
We didn't know what to do.

582
00:32:38,989 --> 00:32:41,397
We were gonna go home
but then.../ Then what?

583
00:32:43,511 --> 00:32:46,425
You have no idea what it's like

584
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:51,523
being the punch line
to every joke, do you?

585
00:32:52,814 --> 00:32:56,636
Someone had to pay.

586
00:32:58,473 --> 00:33:01,884
Come on. We're gonna burn
this place to the ground!

587
00:33:01,884 --> 00:33:03,773
Not with Laurie still in there!

588
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:06,377
Who cares?
She's a traitor!

589
00:33:06,975 --> 00:33:08,807
They've gotta pay!

590
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:11,596
For what they did to us!

591
00:33:12,137 --> 00:33:13,896
To me.

592
00:33:18,046 --> 00:33:19,726
Let's go home.

593
00:33:25,708 --> 00:33:27,153
Oh, my god.

594
00:33:29,373 --> 00:33:32,504
- That's him.
- Oink, oink.

595
00:33:44,883 --> 00:33:46,156
Dierdre?

596
00:33:50,881 --> 00:33:52,214
Someone's...

597
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:55,010
gotta pay.

598
00:34:02,594 --> 00:34:04,245
Run!

599
00:34:15,943 --> 00:34:17,795
It spread so fast.

600
00:34:19,228 --> 00:34:20,951
And then everyone was running.

601
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:23,541
Screaming.

602
00:34:24,904 --> 00:34:27,119
All I could do was stand there

603
00:34:27,996 --> 00:34:29,429
and watch...

604
00:34:31,754 --> 00:34:33,708
Why couldn't Laurie get out?

605
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,428
I don't know.

606
00:34:37,428 --> 00:34:39,478
Everyone else got out,

607
00:34:39,478 --> 00:34:41,471
even her friend.

608
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:44,925
- Her friend?
- Dirk.

609
00:34:47,069 --> 00:34:48,640
Dirk was in the house?

610
00:34:50,101 --> 00:34:52,436
He was the last one out.

611
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,329
Passed out in your dorm room.

612
00:35:07,957 --> 00:35:09,058
It's a nice story.

613
00:35:10,584 --> 00:35:11,439
Leave me alone.

614
00:35:11,439 --> 00:35:13,054
You were the last one
out of the house

615
00:35:13,661 --> 00:35:14,969
when the fire broke out.

616
00:35:16,918 --> 00:35:17,760
That's a lie.

617
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,337
Ever seen an animal
trapped in a fire, Dirk?

618
00:35:21,164 --> 00:35:25,548
What? / They panic,
run in circles, scream.

619
00:35:25,548 --> 00:35:26,801
Horrible way to die,

620
00:35:27,282 --> 00:35:28,756
horrible thing to watch.

621
00:35:29,234 --> 00:35:30,808
I don't have to listen
to this. / Hey.

622
00:35:34,572 --> 00:35:38,063
Laurie's father saw you
that night in her kitchen.

623
00:35:39,529 --> 00:35:40,904
After her mom died.

624
00:35:42,212 --> 00:35:43,614
Please stop doing this.

625
00:35:43,614 --> 00:35:44,725
He said you were her rock,

626
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,070
the one person she
could always depend on.

627
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,770
You'd never leave Laurie.

628
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,684
You stayed that night.

629
00:35:51,684 --> 00:35:52,879
Tried to save her.

630
00:35:53,621 --> 00:35:56,499
But you couldn't, could you?

631
00:36:00,042 --> 00:36:01,686
She made me promise.

632
00:36:03,302 --> 00:36:04,637
Promise what?

633
00:36:05,745 --> 00:36:07,265
That's why I could never tell.

634
00:36:09,257 --> 00:36:10,648
Her pop...

635
00:36:11,764 --> 00:36:15,612
he thinks Laurie died happy.

636
00:36:18,005 --> 00:36:19,777
And the truth would
break his heart.

637
00:36:24,076 --> 00:36:25,834
Tell us the truth now.

638
00:36:31,165 --> 00:36:32,405
He was wrong.

639
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:35,436
I wasn't Laurie's rock.

640
00:36:37,548 --> 00:36:39,339
She was mine.

641
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:45,060
This is all your fault, pledge.

642
00:36:46,868 --> 00:36:47,768
She took pictures!

643
00:36:47,768 --> 00:36:49,528
They're gonna close
us down now for sure!

644
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,870
It's over, Manny.

645
00:36:57,487 --> 00:36:58,648
Hey, don't touch her!

646
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:00,945
You can't boink the oink, Dirk.

647
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:04,818
Then I will.

648
00:37:06,072 --> 00:37:07,408
What's going on?

649
00:37:10,767 --> 00:37:12,247
Dirk?

650
00:37:13,428 --> 00:37:15,311
Dirk...

651
00:37:15,311 --> 00:37:17,761
No! No!

652
00:37:17,761 --> 00:37:20,184
She's still in there! / Dirk?

653
00:37:23,836 --> 00:37:26,454
You a brother?
Or you a bitch?

654
00:37:26,454 --> 00:37:27,999
Give me the key, Manny!

655
00:37:30,728 --> 00:37:32,368
Dirk, help me!

656
00:37:32,368 --> 00:37:33,900
Get away from the door!

657
00:37:40,068 --> 00:37:42,389
Help me! Help me!

658
00:37:42,389 --> 00:37:45,190
Get to the window!
You can climb out!

659
00:37:56,209 --> 00:37:57,415
Get to the window!

660
00:37:58,882 --> 00:38:02,006
Dirk! I can't breathe!

661
00:38:08,322 --> 00:38:10,475
No.
No!

662
00:38:12,528 --> 00:38:14,283
Keep your face where there's air.

663
00:38:14,815 --> 00:38:16,948
Help!
Somebody help!

664
00:38:17,738 --> 00:38:19,230
Help us!

665
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:23,153
Don't you let go of me.

666
00:38:27,629 --> 00:38:28,972
Promise.

667
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,874
What? / You'll
take care of my pop.

668
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:35,164
Don't talk like that.

669
00:38:35,164 --> 00:38:36,338
They're gonna get you out of here.

670
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:40,717
Dirk, you listen to me
and you listen good.

671
00:38:42,381 --> 00:38:43,956
Don't you let him be...

672
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,386
alone.

673
00:38:48,889 --> 00:38:50,520
Promise, Dirk.

674
00:38:51,197 --> 00:38:52,989
Promise...

675
00:38:55,135 --> 00:38:56,727
I promise.

676
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,488
Hey, hey! I won't let you go.
Do you hear me?

677
00:39:02,488 --> 00:39:05,751
I won't let you go!
Won't let you go.

678
00:39:06,236 --> 00:39:07,509
I know you won't.

679
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:11,762
Laurie...

680
00:39:12,449 --> 00:39:13,876
Laurie!

681
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,860
Laurie!

682
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:18,442
Laurie!

683
00:39:22,507 --> 00:39:24,506
* Sarah McLachlanÀÇ 'Fallen' *

684
00:39:24,506 --> 00:39:27,665
* Heaven bent to take my hand,*

685
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:30,420
* and lead me through the fire.*

686
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,514
* Lead a long awaited answer *

687
00:39:33,514 --> 00:39:36,610
* to a long and painful fight. *

688
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:39,896
* Truth be told, I've tried my best *

689
00:39:39,896 --> 00:39:42,330
* but somewhere along the way, *

690
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,968
* I got caught up in
all there was to offer *

691
00:39:49,165 --> 00:39:54,752
* and the cost was so much
more than I could bare.*

692
00:39:54,752 --> 00:39:58,475
* Though I've tried, I've fallen.*

693
00:39:58,475 --> 00:40:02,301
* I have sunk so low.*

694
00:40:02,301 --> 00:40:04,803
* Out of the best,*

695
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:08,493
* the better I should know.*

696
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:11,100
* So don't come around here *

697
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:14,672
* and tell me I told you so.*

698
00:40:20,624 --> 00:40:23,662
* We all begin with good intent *

699
00:40:23,662 --> 00:40:25,996
* Love was raw and young *

700
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:29,791
* We believed that we
could change ourselves *

701
00:40:29,791 --> 00:40:32,194
* and the past could be undone.*

702
00:40:32,844 --> 00:40:35,332
* But we carry on our back *

703
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:38,362
* the burden that time always reaveals.*

704
00:40:38,789 --> 00:40:42,019
* In the lonely light of morning, *

705
00:40:42,019 --> 00:40:45,187
* in the one that would know heal,*

706
00:40:45,187 --> 00:40:49,473
* is the bitter taste
of losing everything *

707
00:40:49,473 --> 00:40:52,338
* that I've held so dear.*

708
00:40:52,338 --> 00:40:54,884
* Though I've tried, I've fallen *

709
00:40:54,884 --> 00:40:58,367
* I have sunk so low. *

710
00:40:58,367 --> 00:41:00,937
* Out of the best,*

711
00:41:00,937 --> 00:41:04,607
* the better I should know.*

712
00:41:04,607 --> 00:41:07,229
* So don't come around here,*

713
00:41:07,229 --> 00:41:12,236
* and tell me that I told you so.*

714
00:41:14,045 --> 00:41:16,845
* Heaven bent to take my hand, *

715
00:41:16,845 --> 00:41:19,840
* Nowhere left to turn *

716
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,977
* lost in those our thoughtful friends,*

717
00:41:22,977 --> 00:41:25,439
* to everyone I know.*

718
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:28,885
* Oh, they turn their heads embaressed*

719
00:41:28,885 --> 00:41:32,217
* pretend that they don't see.*

720
00:41:32,217 --> 00:41:34,050
* that there's one big step *

721
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:36,372
* and slip before you know it *

722
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:43,222
* and there doesn't seem
a way to be redeemed.*

723
00:41:43,899 --> 00:41:47,978
* Though I've tried, I've fallen.*

724
00:41:47,978 --> 00:41:51,615
* I have sunk so low.*

725
00:41:51,615 --> 00:41:54,063
* Out of the best, *

726
00:41:54,063 --> 00:41:58,179
* better I should know. *

727
00:41:58,179 --> 00:42:00,418
* But don't come around here *

728
00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:05,047
* and tell me that I told you so.*
