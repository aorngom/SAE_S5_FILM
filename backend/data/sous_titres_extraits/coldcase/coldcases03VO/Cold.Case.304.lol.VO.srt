00:00:00,276 --> 00:00:03,096
The following story is fictional and does
not depict any actual person or event.

2
00:00:04,042 --> 00:00:06,602
August 12,1945

3
00:00:06,602 --> 00:00:08,798
Whoo-wee, What a doozy, folks!

4
00:00:08,798 --> 00:00:10,656
It's only an exhibition game

5
00:00:10,656 --> 00:00:14,886
but it has all the drama of the
7th game of the World Series!

6
00:00:14,886 --> 00:00:17,656
The bottom of the 9th and
the negro league of All Stars

7
00:00:17,656 --> 00:00:21,655
are dead even with
the major leaguers at 3 apiece.

8
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:24,953
At bat, for the negro leaguers,
Clyde Taylor.

9
00:00:24,953 --> 00:00:27,353
Already, 2 doubles and a single,

10
00:00:27,353 --> 00:00:30,314
this kid has been sensational!

11
00:00:30,314 --> 00:00:33,334
Show him how it's done, rookie.

12
00:00:35,473 --> 00:00:36,929
Time.

13
00:00:43,893 --> 00:00:48,010
Look here,
what'd I tell you, Jackie?

14
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,668
Man, shakin' in his shoes.

15
00:00:49,668 --> 00:00:51,342
No, you watch.

16
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:53,541
The young fella's gonna be just fine.

17
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:55,220
He's got a ton of guts.

18
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,816
How's this one grab ya?

19
00:01:00,498 --> 00:01:02,804
Just right.
Thanks Crumbs.

20
00:01:02,804 --> 00:01:05,050
Make us famous, would ya?

21
00:01:15,627 --> 00:01:19,033
Money, marbles or chalk, gentlemen.

22
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:25,489
I'm taking all bets.
My rookie hits this ball
clear over the grandstand.

23
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:30,702
You can do it, honey pie.
Just one more pitch! This is it!

24
00:01:30,702 --> 00:01:34,539
I'll send you back to the
cotton fields, you hear me boy?

25
00:01:35,421 --> 00:01:37,866
The count is 3 and 2,

26
00:01:37,866 --> 00:01:43,113
here's the wind up,
and the pitch!

27
00:02:06,032 --> 00:02:07,692
Yes!

28
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:49,199
All right, Leonard,

29
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,521
you just wait for yours now.
Keep your eye on that ball.

30
00:02:52,521 --> 00:02:54,654
You can do it,
wait for your pitch.

31
00:02:54,654 --> 00:02:57,587
All right, come on Leonard,
good eye, you can do it.

32
00:02:57,587 --> 00:03:00,322
Watch that ball.

33
00:03:04,216 --> 00:03:06,712
- How old is he now?
- 11.

34
00:03:06,712 --> 00:03:09,016
He didn't get that good
Jeffries size, did he?

35
00:03:09,016 --> 00:03:10,436
His mom's an itty bitty thing.

36
00:03:10,436 --> 00:03:12,835
Tell you what,
the kid's got a motor on him.

37
00:03:12,835 --> 00:03:13,943
He's fast, huh?

38
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:18,019
Problem is, he can't hit the ball
to save his life and never gets on base.

39
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:20,291
Hey Uncle Will, Mr. Stillman.

40
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,232
Hey Leonard,
looking good out there, son.

41
00:03:22,232 --> 00:03:25,279
- If I could only hit the dang ball.
- Oh, the hits will come.

42
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:27,314
- You've got the mechanics.
- I do?

43
00:03:27,314 --> 00:03:28,706
What've I been telling you?

44
00:03:28,706 --> 00:03:31,326
Still, I'm no Clyde Taylor.

45
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:33,167
Let's get you home.

46
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:35,321
Who's Clyde Taylor?

47
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:37,591
- You've never heard of him?
- No.

48
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:39,332
He was the best of the best.

49
00:03:39,332 --> 00:03:41,996
Maybe even better
than Babe Ruth. Right?

50
00:03:41,996 --> 00:03:43,749
That's what my pops used to tell me.

51
00:03:43,749 --> 00:03:46,041
Took the old negro leagues by storm.

52
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,503
But not for very long.

53
00:03:47,503 --> 00:03:49,405
Because somebody killed him, right?

54
00:03:49,405 --> 00:03:51,654
- That's true.
- Who?

55
00:03:51,654 --> 00:03:53,967
- No one ever knew.
- Not even the police?

56
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,592
Sometimes there's
no good evidence,

57
00:03:55,592 --> 00:03:57,219
the police have to put
the case away.

58
00:03:57,219 --> 00:03:58,997
And we're left with just mystery.

59
00:03:58,997 --> 00:04:01,669
But what if it was the Babe
who got murdered?

60
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:03,761
I mean, instead of Clyde?

61
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:07,811
Would the olden day cops
let that be a mystery?

62
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:53,414
Clyde Taylor, 20,

63
00:04:53,414 --> 00:04:56,473
beaten to death next to his car
outside Connie Mack Stadium.

64
00:04:56,473 --> 00:04:58,206
Well, no return
to the scene of the crime,

65
00:04:58,206 --> 00:04:59,990
the stadium was torn
down in the 70's.

66
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:05,537
Body was found after an exhibition game
between the negro league All Stars
and a group of major leaguers.

67
00:05:05,537 --> 00:05:07,745
They found him still in his uniform.

68
00:05:07,745 --> 00:05:12,031
Assigned has down there was
a smear in front of his jersey. / Yeah?

69
00:05:12,031 --> 00:05:14,670
A tobacco stain,
the backside was caked in blood.

70
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,382
Well the story went,
Clyde was attacked from behind.

71
00:05:17,382 --> 00:05:19,090
Struck down with his very own bat.

72
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,719
Which adds up,
his gear bag and mitt were found
next to him, the bat was missing.

73
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:24,139
40's. Different era,

74
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:26,232
ball players lugging around
their own gear.

75
00:05:26,232 --> 00:05:28,620
Might explain why Clyde
had his uniform on.

76
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,078
Colored players probably
weren't allowed to shower.

77
00:05:32,078 --> 00:05:33,220
Suspects?

78
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,524
They were looking at Tyler Cage,
the losing pitcher.

79
00:05:36,524 --> 00:05:38,661
The one Clyde hit a home run off
to win the game.

80
00:05:38,661 --> 00:05:41,311
The players heard him jawing at Clyde
using racial slurs.

81
00:05:41,311 --> 00:05:43,199
But ultimately he had an alibi,

82
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,093
post-game press conference
hadn't even started,

83
00:05:45,093 --> 00:05:50,156
Cage was seen across town
drinking away his post-game blues.

84
00:05:50,156 --> 00:05:52,411
- Located the last to see.
- Yeah?

85
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:56,251
Mr. Joe Crumbly.
Goes by Crumbs.

86
00:06:01,423 --> 00:06:04,218
Mr. Crumbly, you were
the club-house manager for

87
00:06:04,218 --> 00:06:06,628
Clyde's team,
the Philly Steel-Drivers?

88
00:06:06,628 --> 00:06:08,004
Check.

89
00:06:08,004 --> 00:06:12,472
Also on board for the All Star game,
the day Clyde was killed.

90
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,966
You two were the last ones
out of the locker room.

91
00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:18,724
Check. Clyde wanted to
avoid the spotlight so

92
00:06:18,724 --> 00:06:20,689
he waited for the mob
to die down.

93
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:22,691
Hammers a homer and then
liked to lay low?

94
00:06:22,691 --> 00:06:24,874
Yeah, that's how he was.

95
00:06:24,874 --> 00:06:29,539
So I pick up the slack,
be the braggadocios one.

96
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:33,180
See, I believe Clyde,
had he lived,

97
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,465
would have been the first
to cross the color line,

98
00:06:35,465 --> 00:06:37,335
not Jackie Robinson.

99
00:06:37,335 --> 00:06:41,583
So going back, you remember
if Clyde was carrying a bat
with him that night?

100
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,593
Made sure he had it in his bag.

101
00:06:43,593 --> 00:06:45,985
It was the bat he hit
the home run with.

102
00:06:45,985 --> 00:06:50,098
A home run off of Tyler Cage,
the opposing pitcher? / Yes, ma'am.

103
00:06:50,098 --> 00:06:51,582
What was your opinion of him?

104
00:06:51,582 --> 00:06:54,284
The man was lower than oil dirt.

105
00:06:54,284 --> 00:06:57,393
Ask me who killed Clyde,
my money's on him.

106
00:06:57,393 --> 00:07:00,554
Because of the popping off he did
during the game? Racewise?

107
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:03,861
What was said during the game
was never an issue.

108
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:07,110
But off the field, well.

109
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,511
That was a different story.

110
00:07:13,181 --> 00:07:14,846
Hey, Mr. Taylor.

111
00:07:14,846 --> 00:07:16,872
Could I have your autograph?

112
00:07:18,114 --> 00:07:21,144
- What's your name young fella?
- Troy.

113
00:07:21,144 --> 00:07:23,271
OK, Troy.

114
00:07:26,797 --> 00:07:28,114
Best of luck to you, son.

115
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,480
Gee, thanks.

116
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:34,889
Now when I go to the toilet,
I'll have something to use.

117
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:37,946
Hey you little bastards,
get back here!

118
00:07:43,317 --> 00:07:46,106
- I recogize you, the bat boy.
- So?

119
00:07:46,106 --> 00:07:47,835
You're the pitcher's son.

120
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:50,072
Let me have him.

121
00:07:50,072 --> 00:07:53,928
Keep your cotton pickin' hands
off me ya big ape.

122
00:07:53,928 --> 00:07:57,283
What are you gonna do?
Hit a kid?

123
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:01,046
I'd like my name back.

124
00:08:10,443 --> 00:08:11,736
I'm tellin' my dad,

125
00:08:11,736 --> 00:08:16,770
you're gonna be sorry you didn't
keep your paws to yourself, boy.

126
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,532
Rotten to the core,
just like his pa.

127
00:08:25,532 --> 00:08:27,486
Never told the police this story?

128
00:08:27,486 --> 00:08:29,271
Never figured it meant much.

129
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:32,857
Just another jerk kid being a jerk.

130
00:08:32,857 --> 00:08:36,967
How is it you became involved
with what was an all
black organization?

131
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:38,915
I knew Clyde since the war.

132
00:08:38,915 --> 00:08:41,458
Saw him play ball with
the other servicemen.

133
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:45,545
Then we're home, I heard the local
negro team was holdin' tryouts

134
00:08:45,545 --> 00:08:47,244
so I rung him up.

135
00:08:47,244 --> 00:08:50,900
Next, Clyde makes the team,

136
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,683
and tells me I'm comin'
along with him.

137
00:09:01,235 --> 00:09:05,244
Troy. We know about that stunt
you pulled on Clyde after the game.

138
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:08,314
- Asking for his autograph?
- So?

139
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:11,630
So we also know you ran and told
your daddy he put his hands on you.

140
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,195
That don't mean dad went back and
did something about it.

141
00:09:14,195 --> 00:09:16,377
He's dead 10 years,
let him rest in peace.

142
00:09:16,377 --> 00:09:18,095
Well that game ended his career.

143
00:09:18,095 --> 00:09:20,377
- That gives him motive.
- He had an alibi.

144
00:09:20,377 --> 00:09:22,057
So maybe people lied for him.

145
00:09:22,057 --> 00:09:24,312
Look, you know the history.

146
00:09:24,312 --> 00:09:27,503
A white pitcher who loses
to a black team in 1945 may have

147
00:09:27,503 --> 00:09:29,558
just pitched himself out of baseball.

148
00:09:29,558 --> 00:09:31,011
Your dad must've hated Clyde.

149
00:09:31,011 --> 00:09:33,059
Not as much as Moody did.

150
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:36,920
Who's Moody?

151
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,672
Moody Brown.

152
00:09:38,672 --> 00:09:41,265
The player Clyde replaced
on the line-up that day.

153
00:09:41,265 --> 00:09:43,148
Well how did you know about that?

154
00:09:43,148 --> 00:09:44,964
When you're 7 years old,

155
00:09:44,964 --> 00:09:49,308
being the bat boy is like
being a cat's ass.

156
00:09:49,308 --> 00:09:52,288
Down on the field,
up close and personal,

157
00:09:52,288 --> 00:09:54,539
hear what the players are really
talking about.

158
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:57,355
Are you saying you saw something
go down between Moody and Clyde?

159
00:09:57,355 --> 00:09:59,924
Had the best seat in the house.

160
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:24,443
Best not be thinkin' about nothin'
but handin' over that ball.

161
00:10:24,443 --> 00:10:27,076
Real nice.

162
00:10:29,601 --> 00:10:34,060
Mister, what's that scar
on your face?

163
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,850
Ask around.
See what you hear.

164
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:42,333
Hey, you!
Stop right there.

165
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,041
Just heard I ain't playin'
because of you.

166
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:51,491
I'm in the line-up?
I didn't know.

167
00:10:51,491 --> 00:10:53,107
Don't worry, rookie.

168
00:10:53,107 --> 00:10:55,546
We're fine.
We all in this together, right?

169
00:10:55,546 --> 00:10:58,549
- Because we only got one day.
- One day?

170
00:10:58,549 --> 00:11:02,710
Tommorrow, those major leaguers
go back to being the boys of summer.

171
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,447
We go back to being the boys
who shine their shoes.

172
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:07,804
I wouldn't look at it that way.

173
00:11:08,848 --> 00:11:10,318
Look here,

174
00:11:10,318 --> 00:11:14,603
what d'ya say you pull up a lame
for old Moody one time? Huh?

175
00:11:14,603 --> 00:11:15,857
You asking me to fake an injury?

176
00:11:15,857 --> 00:11:19,826
Not too late in the game.
Just give me one at bat.

177
00:11:19,826 --> 00:11:23,776
- One moment.
- Moody I want you to play, I do.

178
00:11:24,337 --> 00:11:26,963
But I couldn't live with myself.

179
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:31,956
All right, then.

180
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:39,267
Let me go.
You're breaking my hand.

181
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:42,102
Right, I'm breaking your hand.

182
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:43,772
You don't see to it
I get the bat,

183
00:11:43,772 --> 00:11:46,523
I'm going to break
your head, understand?

184
00:11:46,523 --> 00:11:48,143
Hey, what's going on?

185
00:11:48,143 --> 00:11:50,473
We're just funnin', Jackie,

186
00:11:51,176 --> 00:11:54,384
like a pair of old giggling
pickaninnies over here.

187
00:11:59,772 --> 00:12:03,117
So, Moody made a threat.

188
00:12:03,117 --> 00:12:06,944
We both know players talk smack
when it comes to playing time.

189
00:12:06,944 --> 00:12:09,373
But when Clyde hit that home run,

190
00:12:09,373 --> 00:12:13,047
all the negros run out on the field
like they just won the World Series,

191
00:12:13,047 --> 00:12:15,039
all except Moody.

192
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:16,585
What was the deal with the scar?

193
00:12:16,585 --> 00:12:17,927
You follow up on that?

194
00:12:17,927 --> 00:12:21,346
Negro player told me he got it in a
pop bottle fight with his cousin.

195
00:12:21,346 --> 00:12:23,377
And?

196
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:26,997
And his cousin wasn't
around no more.

197
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,923
Exsuce me, sir.
You Moody Brown?

198
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:52,117
Sittin' here in front
of this shop, ain't I?

199
00:12:52,117 --> 00:12:55,034
Who else am I gonna be?

200
00:12:55,034 --> 00:12:57,225
Detectives Jeffries and Valens, Moody.

201
00:12:57,225 --> 00:13:00,092
We wanna talk to you about
Clyde Taylor.

202
00:13:00,092 --> 00:13:02,772
Why you wanna come here
drudging up that old mess?

203
00:13:02,772 --> 00:13:05,851
- We may have a crack in the case.
- From 60 years ago?

204
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,263
What crack you got?

205
00:13:07,263 --> 00:13:08,808
One matter concerns you.

206
00:13:08,808 --> 00:13:11,896
It has to do with Clyde
cutting into your playing time.

207
00:13:11,896 --> 00:13:13,810
Oh, that's a stale story.

208
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:17,022
And one you need
to tell us about.

209
00:13:17,022 --> 00:13:19,199
I played the negro leagues,

210
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:21,874
I made my 100 dollars a month.

211
00:13:21,874 --> 00:13:25,714
Beyond that, sorry.
My memory's broke.

212
00:13:25,714 --> 00:13:29,284
A witness heard you tell Clyde
you'd bust his head if you didn't play.

213
00:13:29,284 --> 00:13:31,268
And you didn't play.

214
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,335
I'll admit I was ready
to square off with Clyde.

215
00:13:35,335 --> 00:13:36,968
I'm the squaring off type.

216
00:13:36,968 --> 00:13:41,117
And a game against the major leaguers
didn't come around every day.

217
00:13:41,117 --> 00:13:45,515
Colored player got to feel
what it was like to be equal,

218
00:13:45,515 --> 00:13:48,522
if only for 3 hours
on a Sunday afternoon.

219
00:13:48,522 --> 00:13:51,552
But you didn't get that.

220
00:13:51,552 --> 00:13:57,417
Sir, I wanted a career.
A real one.

221
00:13:57,417 --> 00:14:02,587
Negro tell you that wasn't
on his mind, he's a liar.

222
00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:07,535
Major league scouts are out there,
I can tell they're just
lickin' their chops.

223
00:14:07,535 --> 00:14:11,402
Yeah, they're waitin' to spy me
throw my double wind-up.

224
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:17,008
What d'ya think'll look best
on ol' Satchel there, young rookie?

225
00:14:17,008 --> 00:14:19,978
Yankie pinstripes or Dodger blue?

226
00:14:19,978 --> 00:14:22,564
Either/or should look real sharp,

227
00:14:22,564 --> 00:14:24,931
as long as it comes
with a rocking chair.

228
00:14:27,435 --> 00:14:30,674
Booker T. Washington be
tellin' a joke now.

229
00:14:31,893 --> 00:14:33,562
Oh, what about the color line,

230
00:14:33,562 --> 00:14:35,610
do you really think someone's
gonna break through?

231
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,905
- Satchel, any opinions on the subject?
- Oh, let me see,

232
00:14:38,905 --> 00:14:42,194
who's the best pitcher Joe DiMaggio
said he'd ever faced? / You.

233
00:14:42,194 --> 00:14:44,672
And I give a good interview, too.

234
00:14:49,185 --> 00:14:50,495
Come on, Moody,
calm down.

235
00:14:50,495 --> 00:14:52,445
He's just sore because you're the future.

236
00:14:52,445 --> 00:14:55,701
Truth be told,
Clyde'll beat us all to the majors.

237
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:58,011
There a problem gentlemen?

238
00:14:58,011 --> 00:14:59,768
No, sir, Mr. D.

239
00:14:59,768 --> 00:15:04,040
Fine. May I have a minute, Clyde?

240
00:15:07,801 --> 00:15:10,692
Boys are heapin' some
high praise on you.

241
00:15:10,692 --> 00:15:14,032
All this talk about the majors.

242
00:15:14,032 --> 00:15:16,434
I think it's best to pay them no mind.

243
00:15:16,434 --> 00:15:17,843
That's good.

244
00:15:17,843 --> 00:15:19,972
Because I own your black ass.

245
00:15:19,972 --> 00:15:22,361
Don't you forget it.

246
00:15:26,249 --> 00:15:28,041
So Dandridge saw
the writing on the wall,

247
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:31,818
end of the negro leagues
and his millions going down the drain.

248
00:15:31,818 --> 00:15:34,096
But if he could hold on to Clyde,

249
00:15:34,096 --> 00:15:36,676
maybe his team somehow survives.

250
00:15:37,596 --> 00:15:40,972
What did Dandridge mean
saying he owned Clyde?

251
00:15:40,972 --> 00:15:42,688
I don't know.

252
00:15:42,688 --> 00:15:44,872
But back in them days,

253
00:15:44,872 --> 00:15:50,679
a millionare black man
didn't become one playin' by the rules.

254
00:16:00,856 --> 00:16:03,364
So the negro leagues
made you a rich man.

255
00:16:03,364 --> 00:16:06,032
Millionare by age 24.

256
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:07,709
Sure picked the right job.

257
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:10,712
I wasn't the only one.1945,

258
00:16:10,712 --> 00:16:14,571
it was one the largest black dominated
businesses in the United States.

259
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:18,652
And in '47 Branch Rickey signed
Jackie Robinson so your league

260
00:16:18,652 --> 00:16:21,179
was on the way out
and you were headed for a bankruptcy.

261
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:25,984
Chubby young white fella who paid
attention during black history month.

262
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:27,903
Clyde was your new marquee player.

263
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,873
It'd be bad business
not to tie him up.

264
00:16:29,873 --> 00:16:32,259
- I won't deny that.
- Question is, how?

265
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,437
Players signed month to month
contracts in those days.

266
00:16:34,437 --> 00:16:38,465
No way you were just gonna let him walk
when the majors came callin' / True

267
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:40,703
So what did you have over Clyde?

268
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,693
What's this you owned him stuff?

269
00:16:48,368 --> 00:16:51,821
You ownin' my ass,
is that a joke?

270
00:16:51,821 --> 00:16:56,072
Clyde, you got a gift that's gonna
make somebody a lot of money.

271
00:16:56,072 --> 00:16:59,095
And since you're mine,
it's gonna be me.

272
00:16:59,095 --> 00:17:01,728
Major league's opened the game
up to coloreds.

273
00:17:01,728 --> 00:17:03,135
Why would you think
you could stop me?

274
00:17:03,135 --> 00:17:05,606
Because you're in love.

275
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:09,250
And I know with who.

276
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,048
Thought you were being
careful, huh? / Why?

277
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:14,441
Why would you wanna
do this to me?

278
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:17,088
This whole season's on the field.

279
00:17:17,088 --> 00:17:19,480
You're so naive off.

280
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,010
Simply put, business.

281
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:26,567
So maybe I'm not scared of
what you know.

282
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:32,164
Fine. As long as you're not scared
of  a noose around your neck.

283
00:17:32,164 --> 00:17:35,717
Because you just know
I love to talk.

284
00:17:35,717 --> 00:17:40,384
Suit up.
We'll put this behind us.

285
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:44,845
I'm gonna break your neck.

286
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,173
I'm the one who oughtta be sore.

287
00:17:51,468 --> 00:17:53,894
That Lilly white skin.

288
00:17:53,894 --> 00:17:59,344
bet it's even lighter where the sun
don't shine.

289
00:18:02,363 --> 00:18:05,268
What that must be like.

290
00:18:14,564 --> 00:18:16,104
Lilly white skin?

291
00:18:16,104 --> 00:18:19,451
Clyde's lady friend was
as fair as you.

292
00:18:20,056 --> 00:18:21,349
So maybe after the game

293
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:24,823
Clyde came looking to break your neck
and you broke his head first?

294
00:18:24,823 --> 00:18:27,864
If that was so, I would've killed him
on the choo-choo.

295
00:18:27,864 --> 00:18:30,607
An hour after the game
I was on a train to New York.

296
00:18:30,607 --> 00:18:33,645
- Can you prove that?
- I'll let you do that.

297
00:18:34,846 --> 00:18:36,573
So who was the white girl?

298
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:41,568
Some dame on the arm of this
wise guy, Eddie Mason.

299
00:18:42,091 --> 00:18:44,079
Heard Eddie call her Legs.

300
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:49,025
So maybe Eddie knew about
Legs and Clyde, got a hold of that bat.

301
00:18:49,025 --> 00:18:51,584
And hit a home run of his own.

302
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:59,490
Leonard?

303
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,031
What are you doing here?

304
00:19:01,031 --> 00:19:03,342
I got locked out.

305
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,836
Your mother told me she was
going on morning shift.

306
00:19:05,836 --> 00:19:09,036
She did. I think maybe that
she's at Ronnie's house.

307
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:12,202
- Who's Ronnie?
- Dude that's been staying over.

308
00:19:17,842 --> 00:19:20,231
Thought your sister was
seeing some guy named Benjamin?

309
00:19:20,231 --> 00:19:22,546
Well, that's the problem.
You never know.

310
00:19:22,546 --> 00:19:24,994
Woman's 45, acts all 15.

311
00:19:24,994 --> 00:19:28,909
I ran a check on Eddie Mason,
long sheet. Bad guy.

312
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:30,778
- Still alive?
- Nope.

313
00:19:30,778 --> 00:19:33,128
Dead doer.
That never does it for me.

314
00:19:33,128 --> 00:19:36,152
Well you should think about that next time
you go reaching for a 60 year old case.

315
00:19:36,152 --> 00:19:37,708
Eddie was charged
with bank embezzlement

316
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,527
a week after Clyde was killed.

317
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:41,270
So he was out and about on
the night of the murder?

318
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,595
Figure out who his lady was?

319
00:19:42,595 --> 00:19:45,087
Seems that Eddie had a thing for show girls.

320
00:19:45,087 --> 00:19:46,803
Then he's not such a bad guy after all.

321
00:19:46,803 --> 00:19:49,313
Eddie prefered more legitimate dance.

322
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,354
He was a regular at Papa Belle's review.

323
00:19:51,354 --> 00:19:53,832
Home to old-school Philly's
version of the Rockettes.

324
00:19:53,832 --> 00:19:56,053
So maybe Legs was one of them?

325
00:19:56,053 --> 00:20:00,779
Lil's got Joe Crumbly looking through
old publicity shots from Papa Belle's.

326
00:20:02,221 --> 00:20:04,301
- Hey, Leonard.
- What?

327
00:20:04,301 --> 00:20:08,198
Wanna show you something.
See that guy back there?

328
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:12,230
Yeah. He's old looking.

329
00:20:13,282 --> 00:20:16,779
- He knew Clyde Taylor.
- He did?

330
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:20,708
- They were best friends.
- Wow.

331
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,330
Me and Clyde were tight.

332
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:25,158
But I guess if he was drawn
to a white girl,

333
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:27,260
he'd keep mum about it.

334
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,539
But you do remember
a white girl hanging around?

335
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:31,574
At practice, a time or two.

336
00:20:31,574 --> 00:20:34,207
But none of these gals ring a bell.

337
00:20:35,094 --> 00:20:38,256
My box of doodads are
good for nothing, huh?

338
00:20:38,256 --> 00:20:40,176
Ah, this is something.

339
00:20:40,176 --> 00:20:42,990
One of my most prized possessions.

340
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:46,302
Not too hard to tell which one's me.

341
00:20:46,302 --> 00:20:52,000
Nice. / Nice? Miss doesn't know
who I'm standing along side.

342
00:20:53,892 --> 00:21:01,527
That's you, Clyde, Jackie Robinson,
Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige.

343
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:04,837
Puny me and four giants of baseball.

344
00:21:04,837 --> 00:21:08,222
So, what's the deal with
ball players and tobacco?

345
00:21:08,222 --> 00:21:12,741
Every one of you guys except Clyde
has a big wad of gunk in your mouth.

346
00:21:12,741 --> 00:21:14,695
Clyde likes Bazooka Joe,

347
00:21:14,695 --> 00:21:18,165
but most players did enjoy dipping.

348
00:21:18,165 --> 00:21:20,423
Clyde had a tobacco
stain on his uniform.

349
00:21:20,423 --> 00:21:23,339
Kinda odd if he didn't chew.

350
00:21:23,339 --> 00:21:24,586
Let's dig out that uniform,

351
00:21:24,586 --> 00:21:28,921
run the stain and then do a
DNA dragnet on all of our old-timers.

352
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:33,019
Boss, found three ladies still in the area
that worked at Papa Belle's.

353
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:35,095
Their old publicity shots.

354
00:21:37,889 --> 00:21:40,063
Could one of these be her?

355
00:21:40,063 --> 00:21:44,493
Jeepers! Surprised
I remember so well.

356
00:21:44,493 --> 00:21:46,135
That's Legs.

357
00:21:46,135 --> 00:21:49,747
Her name's Esther Davis.
Lives on the Main Line.

358
00:21:49,747 --> 00:21:54,414
- Say, hey young fella.
- Hey.

359
00:22:03,836 --> 00:22:07,961
Ginger Rogers,
that's who I wanted to be.

360
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:10,687
I was 19, new in town.

361
00:22:10,687 --> 00:22:12,798
Papa Belle's was the place to be.

362
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,363
And that's where you met
Eddie Mason?

363
00:22:14,363 --> 00:22:15,846
After the show,

364
00:22:15,846 --> 00:22:18,239
he asked me to dine
at his table.

365
00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:19,542
And how'd you meet Clyde?

366
00:22:19,542 --> 00:22:23,757
Eddie and his cronies wanted to
swing by the ball field, watch some practice.

367
00:22:23,757 --> 00:22:27,479
While they were yackety-yakking,
I went to find some shade.

368
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:31,157
- And there he was?
- By a drinking fountain.

369
00:22:31,157 --> 00:22:34,476
This gorgeous man trying to cool off.

370
00:22:34,476 --> 00:22:40,726
We hardly said boo to one another but
must have stood there a good 5 minutes.

371
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:43,295
It was storybook,
it really was.

372
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:46,047
Yeah, but now you had
two big problems. / Yes.

373
00:22:46,047 --> 00:22:48,178
One, what to do about Eddie.

374
00:22:48,178 --> 00:22:52,514
And two, falling in love
when it was still 1945.

375
00:22:52,514 --> 00:22:55,104
Did Eddie know
about you and Clyde?

376
00:22:55,104 --> 00:22:58,228
Even if he did
he didn't kill him.

377
00:22:58,228 --> 00:23:01,900
Eddie was in Miami Beach
that weekend, scheming away.

378
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,210
So, him being gone,

379
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,671
you must've been with Clyde
that last day?

380
00:23:05,671 --> 00:23:10,522
I went to the game and met him
afterwards at the water fountain.

381
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,659
Like always.

382
00:23:15,538 --> 00:23:19,283
Feels like every other game
when your name is Satchel Paige.

383
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:25,246
Clyde, what is it?
What's wrong?

384
00:23:25,246 --> 00:23:27,834
- Dandridge knows about us.
- Oh, no.

385
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:31,028
Says I have to play
for him forever, always,

386
00:23:31,028 --> 00:23:32,960
or he's gonna tell about us.

387
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,530
But if you do play for him,
he'll keep his mouth shut.

388
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:38,354
But then I have to give up any chance
of ever playing in the majors.

389
00:23:38,354 --> 00:23:40,582
- So?
- So?

390
00:23:40,582 --> 00:23:42,067
Why is that so important?

391
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:48,648
Because, if a colored ball player can show
he's as good as a white player
in the most American game there is.

392
00:23:48,648 --> 00:23:51,900
People with skin like mine
won't be up at night praying
he could scratch the color away

393
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,580
so he can be normal.

394
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,280
Honey, the world you're dreaming of is
a long, long way off from now.

395
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,784
Gotta start somewhere.

396
00:23:59,784 --> 00:24:02,649
Clyde, don't try to be a pioneer.

397
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:05,110
It's best to just keep
your head down.

398
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,555
Maybe the answer is for you
to lift your head up.

399
00:24:09,334 --> 00:24:14,278
Hey, man of the hour, the world is
waiting for you.

400
00:24:15,347 --> 00:24:16,648
Oh, Clyde.

401
00:24:17,995 --> 00:24:22,687
Dad, look, there he is.

402
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:27,914
Go out front, baby.

403
00:24:31,396 --> 00:24:33,902
So Troy and his father were still there,

404
00:24:33,902 --> 00:24:35,788
during the press conference? / Yes.

405
00:24:35,788 --> 00:24:38,923
Did they say anything else?
Make any threat on Clyde?

406
00:24:38,923 --> 00:24:41,738
No. The father never spoke,

407
00:24:41,738 --> 00:24:44,772
just stood there so menacingly.

408
00:24:44,772 --> 00:24:48,733
I think that was more frightening
than had he said something.

409
00:25:00,091 --> 00:25:02,330
If you weren't such a looker,

410
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,352
I'd be losing my patience
right about now.

411
00:25:04,352 --> 00:25:06,699
If you didn't lie about your dad,
we wouldn't be here.

412
00:25:06,699 --> 00:25:09,671
I never lied.
What'd you do with the Spaniard?

413
00:25:09,671 --> 00:25:11,852
Detective Jeffries, Troy.

414
00:25:11,852 --> 00:25:13,808
Heard some flattering things about you.

415
00:25:13,808 --> 00:25:16,747
The way I see it, you've been
a good boy and a bad boy.

416
00:25:16,747 --> 00:25:18,781
Good because you told me about Clyde
teaching civlity

417
00:25:18,781 --> 00:25:20,807
and how your bratty butt
ran off to tell daddy.

418
00:25:20,807 --> 00:25:27,308
But bad because you left out the part
where you and daddy
doubled back for Clyde.

419
00:25:29,206 --> 00:25:31,817
OK, we doubled back.

420
00:25:32,762 --> 00:25:35,378
Keep going.

421
00:25:35,378 --> 00:25:37,667
When I told him
about the autograph deal,

422
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:39,252
that was the last straw.

423
00:25:39,252 --> 00:25:41,368
He said he wouldn't let that stand.

424
00:25:51,455 --> 00:25:53,368
Nice bat.

425
00:25:54,865 --> 00:25:57,369
Not real fair, sneakin' up on a man.

426
00:25:57,369 --> 00:26:01,199
My son told me what you did.

427
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:04,350
I'm here to tell you
I'm embarassed.

428
00:26:09,658 --> 00:26:12,753
- He's a kid.
- I'm talking about me.

429
00:26:12,753 --> 00:26:16,871
The names I used on you,
during the game. / Oh.

430
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,811
Your first at bat,
I could tell you were special.

431
00:26:22,811 --> 00:26:27,484
Second at bat,  I could tell you
were the best hitter I'd ever faced.

432
00:26:27,484 --> 00:26:31,482
After that I threw you
the hardest ball I'd ever thrown.

433
00:26:31,482 --> 00:26:33,690
You cleaned my clock.

434
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:39,534
Don't feel good,
but now I know.

435
00:26:48,311 --> 00:26:52,892
- Thank you.
- Daddy, come on. Can we go yet?

436
00:26:52,892 --> 00:26:55,914
Troy, come here.

437
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,283
I want you to say you're sorry
to Mr. Taylor. / No.

438
00:27:01,283 --> 00:27:03,897
Get that tobacco out of your mouth.

439
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:10,278
But daddy, you saw the jig had his mitts
on that white lady.

440
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:14,922
Don't judge a book by its cover.
Ya understand?

441
00:27:15,618 --> 00:27:18,496
So I said sorry. Had to.

442
00:27:18,496 --> 00:27:20,928
That was real tobacco in your mouth?

443
00:27:20,928 --> 00:27:23,108
Used to do whatever my dad did.

444
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:25,734
That might explain the stain
on Clyde's jersey.

445
00:27:25,734 --> 00:27:28,353
DNA won't help if the tobacco
was Troy's.

446
00:27:28,353 --> 00:27:30,320
Now can we call this meeting, please?

447
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,807
Yeah, OK Troy.

448
00:27:32,807 --> 00:27:34,192
At least your dad taught
you a lesson.

449
00:27:34,192 --> 00:27:37,541
Not really. I'm still
not real big on spooks.

450
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:40,491
So don't judge a book by its cover
didn't even dent your knuckle head?

451
00:27:40,491 --> 00:27:43,724
That part was about the girl
so that got through just fine.

452
00:27:43,724 --> 00:27:45,238
How was that about the girl?

453
00:27:45,238 --> 00:27:46,969
Well Dad recognized the lady.

454
00:27:46,969 --> 00:27:49,027
She's from the same town down south
where he grew up.

455
00:27:49,027 --> 00:27:50,720
What are you getting at, Troy?

456
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,169
The white lady.

457
00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:56,828
She wasn't really white.
She was black.

458
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:08,708
Does your husband know, Esther?

459
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:11,958
- Know what?
- You're black.

460
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:19,496
- No. He doesn't.
- But Clyde did.

461
00:28:19,496 --> 00:28:21,173
Yes, he was the only one.

462
00:28:21,173 --> 00:28:23,146
Is that why he had to die?

463
00:28:23,146 --> 00:28:25,211
What do you mean?

464
00:28:25,211 --> 00:28:27,487
Your secret was so important to you.

465
00:28:27,487 --> 00:28:32,996
You have a whole lifetime as a white
woman that tells just how important.

466
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:40,450
I came here from Macon , Georgia.

467
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:43,802
I had two sisters, Dorothy and Ruby,
we were dirt poor.

468
00:28:43,802 --> 00:28:47,688
- How did you end up here?
- We were living in Squalor.

469
00:28:47,688 --> 00:28:50,625
Auntie said I had the lightest skin,

470
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:53,082
I could make a real living
like a white person.

471
00:28:53,082 --> 00:28:55,142
And then once here

472
00:28:55,142 --> 00:28:57,684
you were able to pass
and got on at Papa Belle's.

473
00:28:57,684 --> 00:28:59,764
I had some dreams of my own.

474
00:28:59,764 --> 00:29:02,301
But maybe Clyde asked you
to live colored.

475
00:29:02,301 --> 00:29:04,544
Was going to out you.

476
00:29:04,544 --> 00:29:07,165
You did ask him to keep his head down.

477
00:29:07,165 --> 00:29:10,763
And Clyde thought the answer
was for you to lift your head up.

478
00:29:10,763 --> 00:29:13,895
But you wanted your dream
so you stopped him from living his.

479
00:29:13,895 --> 00:29:18,068
No. But I could see
the only way for us

480
00:29:18,068 --> 00:29:21,792
to both get what we wanted
was to go out seperate ways.

481
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,395
That's not what you said before.

482
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:27,262
You wanted Clyde to forget
about the majors.

483
00:29:27,262 --> 00:29:30,108
But then someone changed my mind.

484
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:32,865
Esther.

485
00:29:32,865 --> 00:29:34,027
Who's there?

486
00:29:34,027 --> 00:29:39,797
It's me, Crumbs.
Were you crying?

487
00:29:39,797 --> 00:29:41,830
I'm just scared for Clyde.

488
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:44,287
He's butting head with Dandridge
and he might get hurt.

489
00:29:44,287 --> 00:29:50,408
Yeah. Yeah, I'm scared too.
But because you know,

490
00:29:50,408 --> 00:29:52,810
I think Clyde might hurt himself.

491
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:55,037
What do you mean?

492
00:29:55,037 --> 00:29:58,188
He told me about Dandridge.

493
00:29:58,188 --> 00:30:02,981
And about how the majors are
no longer even a dream.

494
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:05,789
- Clyde said that?
- Yeah, just now.

495
00:30:05,789 --> 00:30:08,329
Cause he's chosen you.

496
00:30:08,329 --> 00:30:10,556
- Oh.
- Yeah.

497
00:30:10,556 --> 00:30:16,214
- You seem pretty happy about it.
- Yes. I should go.

498
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,972
- Esther, wait!
- Ow! / Sorry.

499
00:30:18,972 --> 00:30:23,693
It's just, I've never seen
him so down.

500
00:30:23,693 --> 00:30:27,221
- I sure wish you'd think about that.
- Think about it?

501
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:28,972
- Look, just scram OK?
- What?

502
00:30:28,972 --> 00:30:31,386
Just go.
Take your good foot outta here.

503
00:30:31,386 --> 00:30:32,946
Go to some dance hall in New York

504
00:30:32,946 --> 00:30:37,371
or somewhere. That's for you.
Give Clyde his chance.

505
00:30:37,371 --> 00:30:40,112
No. It's complicated
what's going on between us.

506
00:30:40,112 --> 00:30:41,768
It's not something
you'd understand.

507
00:30:41,768 --> 00:30:43,295
- You think I'm stupid?
- No.

508
00:30:43,295 --> 00:30:46,120
Sweetheart, I know a hell of
a lot more about one thing

509
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,676
than anybody
you could round up.

510
00:30:48,676 --> 00:30:49,793
I know that if you leave Clyde alone,

511
00:30:49,793 --> 00:30:52,155
Dandridge won't have anything
to hold over him.

512
00:30:52,155 --> 00:30:53,653
He'll be free

513
00:30:53,653 --> 00:30:56,873
to swap places with
Babe Ruth and be the best player alive.

514
00:30:56,873 --> 00:30:59,241
That's a fact.

515
00:31:00,748 --> 00:31:02,637
But only if you leave.

516
00:31:02,637 --> 00:31:05,343
Then why doesn't Clyde tell me this?

517
00:31:05,343 --> 00:31:07,929
Oh, come on,
he's a prince.

518
00:31:07,929 --> 00:31:10,022
He'd never tell you to your face.

519
00:31:10,022 --> 00:31:15,104
Please, I'm begging you.
Leave us alone.

520
00:31:23,407 --> 00:31:27,274
So Crumbs knew all about
the two of you?

521
00:31:28,501 --> 00:31:30,960
Clyde made sure of that early on.

522
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,853
Told me I had to pass muster with
the greatest club-house manager
in baseball

523
00:31:34,853 --> 00:31:38,012
or I was out.

524
00:31:45,021 --> 00:31:51,456
Okey, dokey, next, who was the first
African-American to play in the major leagues?

525
00:31:51,456 --> 00:31:53,014
Jackie Robinson.

526
00:31:53,014 --> 00:31:55,936
Wrong, Fleet Walker.

527
00:31:55,936 --> 00:31:59,804
He played back in 1884.

528
00:31:59,804 --> 00:32:01,444
DNA came in Joe.

529
00:32:01,444 --> 00:32:04,584
We thought you might be wondering.

530
00:32:04,584 --> 00:32:06,782
You're sweating.

531
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:13,293
Crumbs, tell another one about Clyde.

532
00:32:13,293 --> 00:32:16,120
Sorry kiddo, don't know
if I have another.

533
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,348
I heard Clyde had a special bat
he liked to use.

534
00:32:19,348 --> 00:32:20,828
I used to hold it for him.

535
00:32:20,828 --> 00:32:23,789
You know,
he use it on the day he was killed?

536
00:32:23,789 --> 00:32:26,705
The one he hit the home run with.

537
00:32:26,705 --> 00:32:29,891
So, tell us about that one, Crumbs.

538
00:32:29,891 --> 00:32:32,132
What d'you say, huh?

539
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:39,163
One day, Clyde handed me a bat

540
00:32:39,163 --> 00:32:42,288
and told me to always
have it on hand.

541
00:32:42,288 --> 00:32:46,044
Said he only used this bat
when he really needed it.

542
00:32:46,044 --> 00:32:49,752
Like when terrible pressure comes
creeping up your neck.

543
00:32:49,752 --> 00:32:52,552
What made that bat so special?

544
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:57,115
Said, because he hit
more grounders with it

545
00:32:57,115 --> 00:32:59,111
than any other bat he ever used.

546
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:02,057
Grounders? But those are lame.

547
00:33:02,057 --> 00:33:04,911
Even so, his last time up,

548
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:06,841
that's the bat he wanted to use.

549
00:33:06,841 --> 00:33:09,715
This old pressure was
creeping up, huh?

550
00:33:09,715 --> 00:33:13,397
Any man would've been
shaking in his shoes.

551
00:33:13,397 --> 00:33:17,150
And so you gave him the bat.

552
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:19,130
And he told me he was
gonna hit a grounder,

553
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,766
just for me.

554
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:24,116
So, there he was,

555
00:33:24,116 --> 00:33:29,405
looking at the fastest
fastest ball you ever did see.

556
00:33:30,294 --> 00:33:33,874
And crack!

557
00:33:33,874 --> 00:33:37,445
It was the home run of home runs.

558
00:33:37,445 --> 00:33:39,619
And that grounder
he was talking about?

559
00:33:39,619 --> 00:33:41,425
That's what I asked.

560
00:33:41,425 --> 00:33:42,904
He said,

561
00:33:42,904 --> 00:33:47,841
you'll learn Crumbs.
Someday, you'll learn.

562
00:33:47,841 --> 00:33:52,395
So, if a homer and a grounder
means the same thing to you,

563
00:33:52,395 --> 00:33:55,804
your nerves won't get to you.

564
00:33:55,804 --> 00:34:00,150
So we'd like to see that bat.

565
00:34:04,061 --> 00:34:07,232
Won't be needing this no more.

566
00:34:22,287 --> 00:34:23,853
Wow.

567
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,828
Missing since the night Clyde died.

568
00:34:25,828 --> 00:34:27,450
Yeah, we've been looking for that.

569
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:28,427
Can I hold it?

570
00:34:28,427 --> 00:34:30,858
I'd better give it to your uncle.

571
00:34:30,858 --> 00:34:34,135
Come on Leonard,
let's take a look at this.

572
00:34:35,045 --> 00:34:39,957
Hey, thank Joe for the nice time.

573
00:34:39,957 --> 00:34:42,776
- Thanks, Crumbs.
- When you get older Leonard,

574
00:34:42,776 --> 00:34:46,447
do me one thing, would ya?

575
00:34:46,447 --> 00:34:51,356
Don't remember what
that bat did to Clyde.

576
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:56,335
Remembr what Clyde did
with that bat.

577
00:34:59,793 --> 00:35:02,407
Wanna sit?

578
00:35:18,227 --> 00:35:21,879
There he is!

579
00:35:21,879 --> 00:35:22,994
Crumbs.

580
00:35:22,994 --> 00:35:27,194
Mr. Major Leagues, here we come.

581
00:35:27,194 --> 00:35:29,578
You can forget about that one.

582
00:35:29,578 --> 00:35:31,805
Never gonna happen
with Esther around.

583
00:35:31,805 --> 00:35:37,582
Oh, yeah, that's the thing.
I fixed it.

584
00:35:37,582 --> 00:35:38,533
What d'ya mean?

585
00:35:38,533 --> 00:35:42,638
Esther. Yeah, she's,
she's gonna go away. / What?

586
00:35:42,638 --> 00:35:46,760
I know it's gonna hurt up front,
but yeah, it's for the better.

587
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,853
- Got her packing.
- Packing?

588
00:35:51,014 --> 00:35:52,993
- Who do you think you are?
- What?

589
00:35:52,993 --> 00:35:55,680
Telling Esther to break it off
with me?

590
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,213
Can't believe you did this to me.

591
00:35:57,213 --> 00:35:59,581
No, I was trying to help you.

592
00:35:59,581 --> 00:36:02,055
You'll see.

593
00:36:05,775 --> 00:36:08,465
Clyde! Your bat!

594
00:36:08,465 --> 00:36:10,856
Keep it. Forever.

595
00:36:10,856 --> 00:36:13,607
But this bat's gonna be in
the Hall of Fame one day.

596
00:36:13,607 --> 00:36:15,569
It's only a game.

597
00:36:15,569 --> 00:36:19,727
Hit a ball and run around bags.
Fun. But for kids.

598
00:36:19,727 --> 00:36:22,592
A man has a life to live.

599
00:36:22,592 --> 00:36:25,479
Stupid broad.

600
00:36:26,203 --> 00:36:29,209
What did you say?

601
00:36:29,209 --> 00:36:31,166
That's what always stops
the great ones.

602
00:36:31,166 --> 00:36:33,461
- Don't let her stop you.
- She's in my soul.

603
00:36:33,461 --> 00:36:34,896
Oh, cripes!

604
00:36:34,896 --> 00:36:37,510
A floozy with a great pair of gams?

605
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:40,181
Big deal!

606
00:36:41,757 --> 00:36:44,930
You've been my friend Crumbs.

607
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:47,642
I'll always remember that.

608
00:36:47,642 --> 00:36:52,232
But you make this game
make your life so small.

609
00:36:52,232 --> 00:36:54,658
- Now I can't even see you.
- Oh, yeah?

610
00:36:54,658 --> 00:36:58,868
You got any idea what you're
thowing away? Huh?

611
00:36:58,868 --> 00:37:01,454
What some men would do
to be in your shoes?

612
00:37:01,454 --> 00:37:04,407
To get just one swing?

613
00:37:04,407 --> 00:37:06,816
Hey! Are you listening?

614
00:37:06,816 --> 00:37:10,383
Hey, slow up!
Clyde, stop! / No.

615
00:37:10,383 --> 00:37:15,671
OK, OK, say idiot, say something!

616
00:37:15,671 --> 00:37:18,725
Clyde! What about our future, huh?

617
00:37:18,725 --> 00:37:21,840
My future? Stop the walking!

618
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,139
You're not going anywhere!

619
00:37:23,139 --> 00:37:28,119
Stop! Just stop! Clyde!

620
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,826
Oh God, oh God.

621
00:37:36,779 --> 00:37:38,167
No, Clyde!

622
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:41,232
Don't go!

623
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:49,651
Please don't go,
please. Please.
