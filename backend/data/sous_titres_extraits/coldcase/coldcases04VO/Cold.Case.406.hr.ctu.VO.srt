1
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,930
Hawk,will you play"summertime blues"for us tonight?

2
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,170
I think I can fit that in.

3
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,590
you know,I listen to you in bed before I go to sleep.

4
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:34,360
Your voice feels so close.Like you're in bed with me.

5
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,160
What's your name,darlin'?

6
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,490
Gloria.

7
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,340
I hope you have sweet dreams tonight,gloria.

8
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,000
mic's starting to pick that up, bones.

9
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,240
Yeah,I called maintenance 50 times.

10
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,710
Sorry,about that, hawk. I'm on it.

11
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,360
All right. You got something for me?

12
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,140
Check out the latest roy hamilton single.

13
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,780
Sounds like it's in 3-D.

14
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,370
Yeah,heard about that. New thing called stereo.

15
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,200
You gonna play it,hawk?

16
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,500
Only if I like it.

17
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,480
Aw,it's smokin',hawk.

18
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,600
Someday,I'm gonna buy a gibson guitar just like the one on that song.

19
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,210
Hold on,elvis. Let's get to work.

20
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,790
Hey,hey,philly.It's your cool rockin' daddy the hawk,

21
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,410
comin' at you live on wixa.

22
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,800
Can you hear the sound,philly? I heard it last night at the locust club.

23
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,150
It was doing funny things to the people.

24
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,370
It made their bodies sweat, made their hips shake.

25
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,420
I want you to turn it up, philly!

26
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,510
I want you to turn up that rock and roll music!

27
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,870
You're dialed into the hawk and this is gene vincent with "say mama!"

28
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:28,440
Let's slow it down for a sec for a little ballad called "scarlet rose."

29
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,590
a filmmaker doing a documentary on '50s rock dj john hawkins.

30
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,840
Oh,the hawk?

31
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,660
My mom used to go to his sock hops.

32
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,300
Said he was pretty wild.

33
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,560
Late '50s were a crazy time to be a kid.

34
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,380
You a rocker,boss?

35
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,590
I had a radio.

36
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,930
Detective rush, this is tom bergin.

37
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,210
Tom's been looking at a tape recording that began seconds after hawkins died.

38
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,400
Didn't hawkins...

39
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,620
yeah,comb his hair with a .38 live on the air?

40
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,270
So they thought. Apparently,as hawkins slumped over,

41
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,620
his hand hit a control that started an in-studio tape recorder.

42
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,830
He taped his shows?

43
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,890
Yeah,for reruns.

44
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,610
And no one's heard this before?

45
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,300
Years ago,but no one's heard what I've heard.

46
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,950
No one had this equipment.

47
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,020
This thing ready yet?

48
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,320
One sec.First I had the tape transferred on m-audio,

49
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,860
and then I flipped it to logic pro

50
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,700
because it totally leverages the new mac pci-dsp card.

51
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,150
Hey,guy.

52
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,890
No one understands a word you're saying.

53
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,640
Right,right. Here we go.

54
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,720
this is right after the gunshot.I'm gonna lower the sound of the record.

55
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,750
All you'll hear is the ambience in the dj booth.

56
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,230
footsteps?

57
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,820
Hawkins wasn't in there alone.

58
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,670
could be a door, someone leaving.

59
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,750
Then it's quiet for 30 minutes until the janitor rain.

60
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,860
So either hawkins woke from the dead and walked out of there...

61
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,080
or his murderer did.

65
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,600
hawkins got top billing over the musicians?

66
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,180
Radio djs were as big as the rock stars.

67
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,310
Alan freed in new york, wolfman jack in L.A.

68
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,790
And the hawk here in philly.

69
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,040
Can't even name a dj on the air now.

70
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,280
Back then they were the tastemakers,scotty.

71
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,930
They picked the songs, made or broke careers.

72
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,560
Hawk could've been the target of some wannabe rock star.

73
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,210
Or some record company suit. That was the time of payola.

74
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,980
Dj's taking bribes from record companies to play songs.

75
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,850
Far as we know,hawk never took any payouts.

76
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,880
Real fan of the music.Wasn't afraid to play black artists to white teens.

77
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:34,980
You a fan?

78
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,510
Nah. I like country music.

79
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,950
Country?

80
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,680
Yeah,I dj'd in college.

81
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,240
This is will jeffries coming at you live.

82
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:49,610
Here's hank williams with "my son calls another man daddy."

83
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,020
just when you think you know someone.

84
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,170
the '58 theory was suicide. Looked self-inflicted.

85
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,350
They didn't have our forensics back then.

86
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,290
Divorced at 24. Ex-wife inherited his money.

87
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,000
Good motive,except that he was broke.

88
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,620
Maybe she found out after the fact.

89
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,930
Even if she's not the doer,first wives know all the dirt.

90
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,760
Excuse me.

91
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,070
Hey,ally, everything okay?

92
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,100
I don't know. It's your brother.

93
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,220
He stopped going to work.

94
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,980
What?

95
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,910
Mike's been in bed for three days straight.

96
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,250
So he's sick?

97
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,290
Not according to the doctor.

98
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,240
He hasn't been the same since that day you came over.

99
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:42,770
What are you talking about?

100
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,960
What'd you say to him,scotty?

101
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,430
Nothing.We were just talking.

102
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,500
I'm scared,okay?

103
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:55,470
he sleeps all day.At night,he wanders around the house like a ghost.

104
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,460
Okay,listen... I'll stop by today.

105
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,500
Okay.

106
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,230
Mike will be fine.

107
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,800
We married young. He was a free spirit.

108
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:18,190
I wanted kids,a simple,quiet life,and he wanted...

109
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,860
to rock and roll?

110
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,660
my father was a musician.

111
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,850
I knew firsthand how tough a show business life could be.

112
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,490
Did you stay in touch with your ex-husband much?

113
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,130
Oh,goodness,no.

114
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,830
I remarried,started a family.I didn't want the likes of john around.

115
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,260
Where were you the night he was shot,dottie?

116
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,360
Oh,really,now. I was at home with my family.

117
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,380
When did you last see john?

118
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,390
a month before he died.

119
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,460
13 years since I'd last seen him.

120
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,810
I was selling our house.

121
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,960
He agree to that?

122
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,430
It was bought with my money,but back then

123
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,010
a woman could only get a loan if a man cosigned.

124
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,050
Different times.

125
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,010
How was john when you saw him?

126
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,720
Same as always.In the middle of a mess.

127
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,470
asthat's right,kids,zip toothpaste!

128
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,180
Keep your smile hip.

129
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,450
brush with zip.

130
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,050
How you been,dot?

131
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,180
Good.

132
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,050
- When you called,I thought...
- just sign the bottom,john.

133
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,360
How's the family?

134
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,690
Everyone's fine.

135
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,650
You know,I heard a record by your dad the other day.

136
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,770
he sound like a drunken fool?

137
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,510
No,sounded like a great bass player.

138
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,320
You promised to play the song i wrote,hawk! What the hell happened?

139
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,110
You been drinking?

140
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,740
I had a bunch of friends and this girl sally from the roller rink.

141
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,300
They were all at the drive-in tuned into the show,waiting to hear my song.

142
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,330
"Belly button rock"?

143
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,910
Yeah,that's it. What happened?

144
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,280
I listened to it.

145
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,050
And?

146
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,500
It's not so hot,bones.

147
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,660
You saying I got no talent?

148
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,780
No. I'm saying I only play what I like.

149
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,310
Baloney sandwich,hawk.

150
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,780
You play whatever the record company pays you to play.

151
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,180
You know that is not true.

152
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,910
How 'bout i get my dad to buy you one of them new skylarks,huh?

153
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,620
You play my song then?

154
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,760
I'm not for sale. I never was. I never will be.

155
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,610
I'm sorry you had to see this,donna.

156
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,640
But I told sally I'd be on the radio.

157
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,670
I'd do anything for you,bones,anything to help you,

158
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,830
but you know how I am about the music,right?

159
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,690
All right,then. Go on,now.

160
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,350
Sally will still dig you.Rock 'n' roll star or not.

161
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,580
Better lock up that gun of yours,hawk.

162
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,220
Excuse me?

163
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,720
You never know who could get to it.

164
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,240
Is that a threat,buddy?

165
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,910
You can't keep stomping on people's dreams all the time and get away with it.

166
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,190
Whose gun was that?

167
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:14,230
John'S. Always kept it at work.

168
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,810
So many crazies out there.

169
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,950
Sounds like bones was one of them.

170
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,210
Heard you had a meltdown with your boss,the hawk.

171
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,750
I had dreams.

172
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,110
Thought hawk didn't appreciate the next elvis.

173
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,340
Well,maybe you found his gun,

174
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,810
made him appreciate you.

175
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,010
came back the next day,hat in hand,and hawk forgave me.

176
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,080
You were at the station the night he was killed.

177
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,140
I was,uh,djing a party that night,so I left.

178
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,220
Plenty of witnesses.

179
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:01,800
Well,the truth is,his career advice saved me from years of futility.

180
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,430
Your songs were that bad?

181
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,910
terrible.

182
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,560
But I could still recognize talent in others.

183
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,950
Built a career on that.

184
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,580
Congratulations.

185
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:15,350
Yeah. I learned what music really was from the hawk.

186
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,140
one in a million,that guy.

187
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,290
Think of anyone who'd want to hurt him?

188
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,400
Well... lot of people didn't care for him,sure,

189
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:31,240
but one guy had more than a garden-variety beef with him.

190
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:41,180
Grab your partner grab your gal and rock...

191
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,820
you feel that beat?

192
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,130
Now when this song kicks in,

193
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,280
I want you kids to shake it.

194
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,130
can you shake it?

195
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,850
I don't think you heard me.I said,can you shake it?!

196
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,420
Well,all right! Let's go!

197
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,870
hey,hawkins?

198
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,240
Your mama colored?

199
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,310
Come again?

200
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,170
I figure she must be,you like playing this jumpity-squawk so much.

201
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,050
It's rock and roll.

202
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,620
Why don't you take the stick out of your tail and enjoy the beat?

203
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,210
Carli chester?

204
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,380
You recall that name?

205
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,410
No. Should I?

206
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,470
She's one of the girls you got out there dancing like a whore.

207
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:58,930
Take a look,mister.Those kids are alive,cause they can feel the music.

208
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,100
Carli is 16 years old.

209
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,390
She's my little girl,and she's in trouble.

210
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,050
Trouble?

211
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,540
Month ago she went to one of your sock hops.

212
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,040
Says she met you at a party afterwards.

213
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,680
I meet a lot of fans.

214
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,840
You did more than meet my daughter.

215
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,390
I'm afraid you've been misinformed.

216
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,760
You're calling my little girl a liar,sir?

217
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,300
No,but I'm not the father.

218
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,290
You either take responsibility,

219
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,200
or I'm gonna fit you for a pine-jacket.

220
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,970
Understand me,buster?

221
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,360
turn it up,bones.

222
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:34,780
You got it,hawk!

223
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,110
teeny-boppers always did love the hawk.

224
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,370
Sounds like he did some lovin' back.

225
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,950
Kind that gets you arrested.

226
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,660
Or shot in the head with a .38.

227
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,250
You recall a rock dj known as the hawk,lloyd?

228
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,230
Never did care for that kind of music.

229
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,170
He got your daughter pregnant back in '58.

230
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,260
I was wrong about that.

231
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,150
How so?

232
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,580
My daughter lied.

233
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,800
It was her moron boyfriend who's now my moron son-in-law.

234
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,870
Thought hawkins killed himself.

235
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,200
He was murdered.

236
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,980
Not surprised to hear it.

237
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,320
That right?

238
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,130
I saw him in a neighborhood diner time to time.

239
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,440
Two ships passing in the night.

240
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,960
You want to elaborate?

241
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:37,340
A few months before he died,

242
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,680
I took my family to breakfast before sunday services.

243
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,460
He was there.

244
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,170
Coming off of a late night?

245
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,790
And getting into trouble with a young girl again.

246
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,480
You know what they say about a racetrack?

247
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,050
It's a place where windows clean people.

248
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,400
That right?

249
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,060
You look familiar. Have we met?

250
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,410
On the radio.

251
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,570
I'm your #1 fan. You can call me jenny.

252
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,840
Jenny. It's a nice name.

253
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,110
People said you come here a lot.I hope I'm not bothering you.

254
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,470
Not at all,kid.

255
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,410
Will you play "my kind of dream" for me tonight?

256
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,670
Sure.

257
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,510
what's your kind of dream,jenny?

258
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,920
Gettin' out of this town.

259
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:37,650
Goin' where?

260
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,610
Anywhere.

261
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,560
It's a nice place-  anywhere.I've been there myself many times.

262
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,880
It's got to be better than secretarial school.

263
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,710
That so bad?

264
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,790
It's a train ride to squaresville.

265
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,320
see,I wt to be a singer.

266
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,020
Get in line. That's a hard dream.

267
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,820
But it's mine.People in line aren't my problem.

268
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,410
You sure are feisty,jenny.

269
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,620
Born that way.

270
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,880
what the hell you doing with gramps?

271
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,350
None of your business,skiz.

272
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,180
We're going now.

273
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,060
Get off of me!

274
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,340
Why don't you take a walk? Cool off.

275
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:15,200
Why don't you keep your nose out of it,old man,before I break it for you?

276
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,550
Kid,you rode in here on a bicycle.

277
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm quaking in my boots.

278
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,880
I'm staying,skiz,so scat.

279
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,270
Woot de do.

280
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:45,220
This skiz clown-- know his real name?

281
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,740
Scott sienkovic.

282
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:51,580
I remember because he made the front page of the papers a few months later.

283
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,290
Boy scout of the year?

284
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,890
Armed robbery.

285
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,910
Shot a bank teller.

286
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,810
Had it out for hawkins big time,skiz.

287
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,800
And we know you're not shy with a firearm.

288
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,680
Grown man going after a girl half his age.

289
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,530
Guy deserved to get shot.

290
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,090
You want to tell us where you were the night he died?

291
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:21,370
Bowling at the thunderbird lanes.Me and 100 other kids heard that needle skip.

292
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,300
we'll check that out,skiz.

293
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,810
Woot de do.

294
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,030
This jenny-- she your girlfriend long?

295
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,680
Couple of months,before she got all obsessed with hawkins.

296
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:32,650
How obsessed?

297
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,460
She kept calling the radio,

298
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,600
writing him letters,

299
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,170
talking about him nonstop.

300
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,830
You know,real psycho stuff.

301
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,080
You think they had an affair?

302
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,580
Must have.

303
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:45,190
Why else would she give two pennies about that loser?

304
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,130
Sounds like it was a one-way street.

305
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,910
She got crazier and crazier over it.

306
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:53,270
One night we were in front of a real rock star,

307
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,300
and as usual,all she cared about was the hawk.

308
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,520
All right! Now here's the one you've been waiting for--

309
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,550
little richard!

310
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,770
skiz,you got to help me get to the hawk.

311
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,900
Stop acting nutso,jenny.

312
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,560
I got to see him. You don't understand!

313
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:30,730
He's an old coot. Why do you care?

314
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,730
Don't talk about him like that!

315
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,170
You're on your own,dollface.

316
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,530
do this,we'll go park later.

317
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:42,930
Promise?

318
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,840
You helping me get to him or not?

319
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,220
Woot de do.

320
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,020
We got to talk to the hawk.

321
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,270
Yeah,and I got a date with jayne mansfield.

322
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,070
You think you're funny?

323
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,880
Hawk!

324
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:05,150
hey! Why'd you stop taking my calls?

325
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,130
I've been busy,jenny.

326
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,740
You shouldn't even be back here,all right?

327
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,230
I just...I just want to talk.

328
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,160
About what?

329
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,090
Us.

330
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,150
Us?

331
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,800
Jenny,there is no us.

332
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,080
I made it for you.

333
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:30,310
play it. You'll understand everything.

334
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,450
I'll never forget you.

335
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,070
"Scarlet rose."

336
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,490
Same song hawk was playing on the radio when he was killed.

337
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,000
Know where we can find this jenny?

338
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,220
Ran into her after I got out of jail.

339
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,240
All married.Mrs. Jenny monahan.

340
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,750
Pretended like she didn't know me.

341
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,680
That's a surprise.

342
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,080
Can I get out of here?

343
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,350
Yeah.

344
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,710
Sounds like we got a groupie gone wild.

345
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,240
At 17,you think your first love's your last.

346
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,010
Yeah. Every fan knew where the hawk broadcast.

347
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,810
I wonder if jenny found her way there.

348
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,620
And found the hawk's gun.

349
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,290
what's going on,mike?

350
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,930
What do you mean?

351
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,330
This.

352
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,490
It's got to be be some kind of virus.

353
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,070
Think I can afford to miss work?

354
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,650
The doc says you're okay physically.

355
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,120
Oh,he's just pissed I'm late with his bills.

356
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,190
da called me again.

357
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,410
Yeah,this coach fitzpatrick thing.

358
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,920
The case is... falling apart.

359
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,730
The only guy who agreed to testify is getting scared.

360
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,650
He might go south on the stand.

361
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,790
Judge could toss it.

362
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,670
- You sure you don't remember anything?
- No way.

363
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,300
I ask because...

364
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,610
there was this one night you came home from practice.

365
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,570
Oh,god,scotty,that was a long time ago.

366
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:44,950
Yeah,but I remember,'cause... you were pretty messed up.

367
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,900
You slept in your clothes.

368
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,080
you okay,mike?

369
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,720
I'm fine.

370
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,520
Go to sleep.

371
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,020
Something happen at practice?

372
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,450
No.

373
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,450
Hey,why are you being so quiet?

374
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,530
Just don't go there no more,okay?

375
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,500
Don't go near the coach.

376
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,950
Why?

377
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,360
You want to play guess?

378
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,260
Come on.

379
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,950
Guess this song.

380
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,510
you got it?

381
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:48,010
Scotty,I'm too tired,okay?

382
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,990
Okay.

383
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:52,910
We'll play tomorrow night.

384
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,590
All right. Night,mikey.

385
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,190
Night.

386
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,590
I don't remember that night.

387
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,410
Well,what about that song?

388
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,440
No.

389
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,490
You're sure?

390
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,480
I'm tired,scotty.

391
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:28,740
That was the only time I ever saw you get so... bummed out.

392
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,670
I mean,you were crying...

393
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,750
if I was bawling,it was probably because that weasel jay shortz cheap-shotted me.

394
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:40,340
Yeah. Probably.

395
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,260
We'll talk later,all right? I'm just beat.

396
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,080
Okay.

397
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,540
you don't get better soon,I'm going to pound you.

398
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,540
Oh,yeah,that'll be the day.

399
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:43,960
How about a little music?

400
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,200
May I?

401
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,230
interesting lyrics you wrote for the hawk.

402
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,690
How'd you get that record?

403
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,020
Bones kept all of hawk's stuff,

404
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,480
including the song he was playing when you killed him.

405
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:42,130
Me? Oh,you're joking,right?

406
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,840
Back then it was called a teenage crush.

407
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,430
Now we call it stalking.

408
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,830
I was a lonely,confused kid, not a murderer.

409
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,740
Can't just take your word for it,jenny.

410
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,240
I was at home that night with my sisters.

411
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:59,060
Believe me,hawk had bigger problems than a lovesick teenybopper.

412
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,730
What kind of problems we talking?

413
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:07,870
One night... I snuck into the station to see him.

414
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,420
I got an idea of what he was up against.

415
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,210
Meaning what?

416
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,150
The record companies.

417
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,400
They were always trying to make him take payola.

418
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:18,370
Hawk doesn't sound like the kind of dj that would take money to play a song.

419
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,760
Well,that didn't stop them from trying.

420
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,650
Thanks,ben.

421
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,240
Didn't know you were buying dinner tonight.

422
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:35,320
I sent you a record last week,expected it on the air by now.

423
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,210
I'm not for sale.

424
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,770
Everyone's for sale.

425
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,610
Funny,I heard you play one of my groups today.

426
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,680
Hey,I got nothing against your label.

427
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,840
Was it that new warner mack tune? That's pretty hot.

428
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,930
No,the darts,"square town."

429
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,830
Oh,bones picked that one.

430
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,680
I give him a pick each day.

431
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,130
And he chose mine.

432
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,500
are you saying that bones took money to play a song?

433
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,810
Bones understands the game.

434
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,270
Djs like you are dinosaurs.

435
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,550
That right?

436
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,240
We've got the money,the artists,the control.

437
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:13,460
Radio is just my personal handshake to the buying public.

438
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,090
And if the buying public doesn't want it?

439
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,720
One choice of entree you eat, what's on the plate.

440
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:21,780
You know what?People like you take everything that is real and good

441
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:24,430
and you turn it into tinsel.

442
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,000
But the worst part...

443
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:31,020
tinsel-man...  is that you don't even know it.

444
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:34,100
Oh,so you're the big shot celebrity with all the answers,that it?

445
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,800
No,I'm just like the kids.

446
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:38,500
I'm a fan. I'm a damned fan of the music.

447
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:42,130
Now,if you will excuse me,I have to sell some toothpaste.

448
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,460
You give my best to bones.

449
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:46,340
That's right! Zip toothpaste!

450
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,550
If you want to keep your smile hip,

451
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,640
you'd better brush with some zip!

452
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,840
Gave up the singing career then and there.

453
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,810
Saw how cutthroat it was.

454
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,910
That the last time you saw the hawk?

455
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,570
He looked crushed.

456
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,660
So the hawk knew bones was on the take.

457
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:13,430
And maybe hawk was going to do something about it.

458
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:21,780
Your career is over if authorities knew you were taking payola,right,bones?

459
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,820
Fcc was cracking down,lot of people's lives ruined over that.

460
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:27,980
You can't prove I took money.

461
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,590
We don't care about payola in '58.

462
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,990
We care about who killed john hawkins.

463
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,140
Hawk confront you on what you did?

464
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,970
The same night he found out.

465
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,310
Keep talking.

466
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,850
I never meant to betray him.

467
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,280
But you did,bones.

468
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,310
It didn't matter.

469
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,550
Something had already changed in him.

470
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,050
If I get my own show,

471
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,880
you girls are my first guests.

472
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,540
Bones,we got to talk.

473
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,470
Hawk! Have a seat.

474
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:10,770
This is,uh,this is gigi,and this is lulu.

475
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,690
Gilugilu.

476
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,940
You mind,girls?

477
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,830
We need some privacy.

478
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,790
hurry back.

479
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,230
What are you doing here,bones?

480
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:31,180
Mr. Ockley invited me.This is some shindig,huh?

481
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:34,130
I got two chicks after me. Can you believe that?

482
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,880
They're hookers,bones.

483
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,860
Wh-what?

484
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:42,690
No,lulu's A dance student, and gigi's A...

485
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,660
stripper.

486
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,300
I've seen her act,umbrellas.

487
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,770
you're fooling.

488
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,420
I know you took money to play that darts song.

489
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,160
It was just one song.

490
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:59,980
That one song means that they've got me over a barrel.

491
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,060
I don't understand...

492
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,790
I could go to jail...

493
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,770
because of what you did.

494
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:10,340
Mr. Ockley says it's how the game's played.

495
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,480
You know what the game is,bones?

496
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:16,190
It's the music and the fans who love it.

497
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,270
And then there's all this.

498
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:22,130
The dealmakers,the sellouts,the price of your soul.

499
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,970
I'm sorry,hawk.

500
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,410
I'm so sorry.

501
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,070
What are you gonna do?

502
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,120
I don't know,maybe leave philly for a while.

503
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,030
What about your show?

504
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,560
Aw,to hell with it.

505
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,570
To hell with all of this.

506
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,670
I got something more important in my life now.

507
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,020
Jenny.

508
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,320
but she's just a fan.

509
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,770
No.

510
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,430
She's more than that.

511
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,920
Me and her gonna take a little trip out west.

512
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,090
Hawk...

513
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,880
I just wanted to be a winner.

514
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,140
Like you.

515
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,960
You always were,kid.

516
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,340
Steep price. We all paid.

517
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,150
Some more than others.

518
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:30,480
So jenny and hawk were going away together?

519
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,130
That was the plan.

520
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,620
But,the next night, hawk was dead.

521
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,190
Funny how jenny failed to mention her travel plans with hawk.

522
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,780
Failed to mention a lot more than that.

523
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:46,900
Follow me.That documentary dude? He's got nothing on me.

524
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,090
Check it out.

525
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,290
Lyrics to "scarlet rose."

526
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,710
See,the way jenny reacted to that song got me thinking.

527
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,280
We already heard the lyrics,nick.

528
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:59,210
Well,I've been on the phone with ascap all day.

529
00:32:59,220 --> 00:32:59,860
What's that?

530
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,810
The american society of composers.

531
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,840
And it turns out there were some lyrics that jenny didn't record.

532
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:05,840
Really?

533
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,880
Like that elton john song "daniel"? You know what that's about?

534
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,430
A guy missing his brother daniel.

535
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:14,950
Yeah,but you never know the reason why 'cause of the verses he left out about vietnam.

536
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,860
"Daniel's" about vietnam?

537
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,150
How do you know that?

538
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,340
The ascap chick told me.See,changes the entire meaning.

539
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,200
So look at the lyrics that jenny didn't record.

540
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:28,350
So dream your sweet little dreams,and I will kiss your tiny cheek

541
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,000
and though I must leave now know,that you'll always be with me

542
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,050
I offer up this prayer,that everywhere she goes,

543
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:39,650
please protect my baby,my sweet,sweet scarlet rose.

544
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,240
Song is registered under the name john hawkins.

545
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,020
Circa 1942.

546
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,320
So the hawk wrote it,not jenny?

547
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,030
Sounds like a lullaby.

548
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:51,100
Well,maybe jenny wasn't his girlfriend.

549
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,120
My money says she's his daughter.

550
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,730
john hawkins was your father, not your heartthrob.

551
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,040
He divorced dottie when you were four.

552
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,120
Why keep that secret,jenny?

553
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:13,720
I never considered him my father.He left. I never saw him again.

554
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:15,240
So whyrack him down?

555
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:18,380
Maybe cause you wanted to tell hawk what it felt like to be abandoned?

556
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,840
And maybe he rejected you again.

557
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,190
So you start sneaking into the station.

558
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,630
You're wrong.It wasn't like that...

559
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,160
come on,jenny.Your father let you down once,then twice.

560
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:27,990
So you made him pay...

561
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,140
no!

562
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:35,690
Finding him was the best thing that ever happened to me.

563
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,290
When did you tell him who you were?

564
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,780
The night little richard played When I gave him my record.

565
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,870
I couldn't leave. I had to find him.

566
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:14,870
I used to play this song for...a little girl I knew.

567
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:21,070
I used to sit her up right next to me like a princess.

568
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,760
Was her middle name rosemary?

569
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,060
Jennifer rosemary hawkins.

570
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:32,350
I used to tell her that scarlet roses were the prettiest in the world.

571
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,670
Just like his little girl.

572
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,540
Your scarlet rose.

573
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,020
I was so afraid to tell you.

574
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,850
So you did it in a song.

575
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,140
You listened to it?

576
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,580
It's beautiful.

577
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:54,300
Six months ago I found some old photos mom hid away.

578
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,880
When we were a family.

579
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:00,850
You remembered me at all?

580
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,660
I never forgot you

581
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,750
I want you to understand why I had to leave.

582
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,620
It doesn't matter now.

583
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:13,580
No.I was living for myself.I was constantly on the move.

584
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:17,160
One year in new york,next year in L.A.

585
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,500
Lots of cigarettes and booze  and...

586
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,830
lots of static.

587
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,670
Dottie was right. It was...it was no place for a kid.

588
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,550
I wouldn't have cared.

589
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:41,300
How 'bout we take that trip to anywhere?

590
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,450
Let me make up for lost time.

591
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,090
What about your show?

592
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:53,960
I told 'em I was going to take a little time off to spend with my family.

593
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,630
We talked about leaving in a couple of weeks.

594
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,100
He said I could sing backup with a band in california.

595
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,610
But all I cared about was having my dad back.

596
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:16,270
Well,how'd your mom take the news?

597
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,740
I never told her.

598
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,470
You sure?

599
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,620
Might get her upset.

600
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:24,810
That might even go talk to the hawk.

601
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,550
Try to stop him.

602
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,850
Everything my mom did was because she loved me.

603
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:42,170
I understand you and hawk had a daughter?

604
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:46,630
Jenny was legally adopted by my second husband.

605
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:53,090
Still. It's,uh...strange how you left that out.

606
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,090
John was never much of a father. So,uh,it didn't matter.

607
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,820
What about your own father?

608
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,190
What does he have to do with this?

609
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,370
Your mom died young,and your father raised you.

610
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,130
The musician?

611
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:15,760
If you can call playing at holiday inns along route 1 being a musician.

612
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:18,920
Died on the road at age 43.

613
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:21,550
Suicide.

614
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:27,450
I can see how jenny wanting to be a singer was upsetting.

615
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,660
She wouldn't listen to me.

616
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:32,940
She thought her passion was enough to give it a try.

617
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,100
Passion is for fools.

618
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:40,580
Passion is a fifth grade girl finding her dad hanging dead in a motel bathroom.

619
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:42,900
You'd do anything to keep jenny from ending up like that.

620
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,720
I was trying to protect her.

621
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:46,700
But she was determined.

622
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:50,520
And she wanted her real dad to help make her dreams come true.

623
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,080
And what does he do?

624
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:56,400
He encourages her. Invites her to california to sing.

625
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:57,730
My god.

626
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:03,240
You went to the studio that night,didn't you,dottie?

627
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,750
To stop him.

628
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,100
I went there to talk.

629
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:19,480
I swear,just to talk.

630
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:39,190
Jenny told me everything.

631
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:41,900
You stay away from her.

632
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,700
She's my daughter,too,dottie.

633
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:45,550
No.

634
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,760
A daughter is someone you raise.

635
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,690
Someone you take to girl scouts,

636
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,750
someone you make dinner for every night,

637
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,580
whose tears you wipe when she cries.

638
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,620
I want to be there for her now.

639
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,610
You just want to fill her head with nonsense.

640
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:04,990
No,I want her to dream.Or to at least try,dottie,don't take away her dreams.

641
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,790
You abandoned us.

642
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,080
You're a selfish son of a bitch,and you always will be.

643
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:10,910
I'm not that man anymore.

644
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:12,920
You will ruin her life

645
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:15,260
Poison her with silly notions of singing.

646
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:18,820
She is good,dottie. She is really good.

647
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:19,530
I've heard enough...

648
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,280
no,I want you to hear this,all right.

649
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:24,480
She's got talent, She's got real talent.

650
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:31,530
Let's slow it down for a sec for a little ballad called

651
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,170
"scarlet rose."

652
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:51,220
dottie.

653
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,310
I can't lose her,john.

654
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,120
Take it easy,dottie.

655
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,070
Take it easy.

656
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,540
Don't fill her with dreams.

657
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,480
Dreams just break your heart.

658
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,530
Gimme that thing,dottie.

659
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,730
Come on now,sweetheart,come on.

660
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:13,650
That's right.Okay.

661
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:22,300
Scarlet rose... scarlet rose...
