"stop war"

00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,300
Thou shalt not kill

4
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,300
June 5,1981

5
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,510
honestly,z,was there a party where you didn't drop trou?

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,890
Question is why?It's elfin.

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,100
Can't even see it.

8
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,750
Exactly.

9
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,390
Bobby kennedy,eat your heart out.

10
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,260
I will pay you $100 to destroy that.

11
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,280
I'm not kidding.

12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,300
Ow!Looking sexy,sweetie.

13
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,690
Just what the doctor likes.

14
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,840
Uh...sweetie,that's sara.

15
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,380
Oops.Really?

16
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,420
We looked alike once upon a time.

17
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,010
We still do.

18
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,590
You're just prettier.

19
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,940
First six months I knew these two,thought they were sisters.

20
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,190
'Cause you were on acid your entire freshman year.

21
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,090
Come on,guys.
Z wasn't always on acid.

22
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,870
Yeah.I switched to mushrooms sophomore year.

23
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,450
How much longer you going to torture us,jack?

24
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,800
Oh,I love these pictures.

25
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,250
Reminds me of the freedom of our college days.

26
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,400
How we all met.

27
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,320
I'd go back in a heartbeat.

28
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,910
Yeah?Uh-huh.

29
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,860
Back then,I had so much time.

30
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,340
Spent it with you guys.

31
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,450
- And now...
- work people.

32
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,500
- Bills people.Commute people.
- Voted-for-reagan people.

33
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,900
- Hey.
- yeah

34
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,020
Mcbride.

35
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,850
Sorry.I don't know how that one got in there.

36
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,610
I guess the show is over.

37
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,880
johanna?Everything all right?

38
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,530
- morning,boss.
- morning

39
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,980
- Louie.
- Hey,rush,long time.

40
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,360
Looking good.

41
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,930
Back at ya,louie.

42
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:42,480
Couple named jack and johanna kimball died here in 1981.

43
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,540
It looked like an accidental gas leak explosion.

44
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,500
Yeah,"looked" being the operative word.

45
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,830
Blast from the stove ripped through  a portion of the kitchen floor.

46
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,660
Debris fell behind the basement drywall.

47
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,290
Did the owner find something?

48
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,280
Construction foreman did while doing renovations.

49
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,090
Fragments of a pipe cap...

50
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,650
and melted battery.

51
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,960
Talking bomb?

52
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,120
A bomb specifically designed to mimic a gas explosion.

53
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,370
That's why they didn't find anything back in '81?

54
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,870
Yep.Can't find what you're not looking for,right?

55
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:19,130
- Battery was used for a triggering device?
- Bingo.

56
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,300
- What kind of couple were these two?
- Clean-cut.Upwardly mobile.

57
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,910
And blown to bits.

Nothing we don't know.

63
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,070
The kimballs met at penn,got married in 1973.

64
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,500
Jack was an ad copywriter.
Johanna was a corporate lawyer.

65
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,260
No kids.

66
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,910
All work and no play.

67
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,450
Young couple making a lot of money,settled into the main line.

68
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,240
1981,First wave of yuppies.

69
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,300
College friend named sara lowell paid for their funerals.

70
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,510
Lil and scotty are starting there.

71
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,370
Excuse me.

72
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,180
- Hey,janie.
- Hey,dad.

73
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,100
- Hey,sean,how ya doing?
- Okay.

74
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,640
- What do you got there?
- Avatar aang.He can bend air.

75
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,610
Is that right?

76
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,580
go wait in grampa's office,sweetie.
I'll be right there.

77
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,090
- You okay,janie?
- Yeah.

78
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,630
No.

79
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,670
I was wondering if you could take sean for a couple of days.

80
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,410
- Mom's in florida.
- Sure,sure.

81
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,920
Carl and I need a night together to talk.

82
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,890
- Something happen?
- No.

83
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:12,060
We've just become strangers who live in the same house.

84
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,530
Janie,I know I'm the last person to give advice on this...

85
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,210
good,bad,whatever it is.

86
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,700
Don't leave anything left unsaid.

87
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,040
I won'T.

88
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,370
You sure you can handle sean?

89
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,750
I could handle you,right?

90
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,310
These flowers are beautiful,sara.

91
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,190
What are they?

92
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,110
Cattleya orchids.

93
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,290
Rely on other shoots to bloom.

94
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:06,270
My mom always said they symbolized the strength of family.

95
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,030
- Hmm,pretty.
- Thank you.

96
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,040
Any thoughts on who'd want to hurt jack or johanna?

97
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,760
None.They were a young,happy couple,no enemies.

98
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,660
So when'd you last see them?

99
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,260
They hosted A...a college reunion weekend.

100
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,290
We left on saturday.

101
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,950
Next night they were dead.

102
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,500
Reunion?
Fun times?

103
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,360
Well,there was lots of partying and talking into the night.

104
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,160
Like the old days.

105
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,570
You didn't have such a wonderful time?

106
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,820
I was...still kind of stuck in my old hippie ways.

107
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,660
Didn't fit very well into the decade of greed.

108
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,090
Jack and johanna,they hippies,too,back in the day?

109
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,540
No,I was the hippie.

110
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,250
- They were the true activists.
- The height of the vietnam war.

111
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,560
They were protesting against an america
that had become wnean imperialist bully.

112
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,980
Sounds vaguely familiar.

113
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,100
Capitalism was a dirty word for us in '71.

114
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,560
And in '81?

115
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,570
For some of us not so dirty anymore.

116
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,400
300 watts a channel.

117
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,740
Nice.

118
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,100
How much?

119
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,380
- I try not to dwell on that.
- Why?Don't feel guilty.You earned it.

120
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,740
By writing candy bar slogans.

121
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,770
Remember when we wanted our talents to serve a purpose?

122
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,060
Purpose is for cub scouts.

123
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,110
- Hey,I just turned that down.
- It's still too loud to neighbors?

124
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,840
It's friday night.

125
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,100
- You're not ready for bed.
- I didn't say that.

126
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,810
Refill?

127
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,060
At your service.

128
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,110
Sara?You want something?

129
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,540
I think I'll join you.

130
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,670
Remember that summer freshman year?

131
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,670
You visited me.
My parents were gone.

132
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,420
Feels like yesterday.

133
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,390
- Yesterday being 12 years ago.
- I know.

134
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,850
I think about those days too much.

135
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,260
What are you doing?

136
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,940
Fixing your hair.Relax.

137
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,400
Well,fix it in front of jack next time.

138
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,620
All right,don't put on airs with me.

139
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,080
Excuse me?

140
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,290
You're a long way from that one-bedroom apartment in newark.

141
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,900
Grow up,porter.

142
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,700
Stop acting like you just stepped off the mayflower.
Your dad was a plumber.

143
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,900
You know,isn't it ironic that you work for a military contractor?

144
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,880
What's that supposed to mean?

145
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,090
I wonder what your boss would say  if he knew what you did in college.

146
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,590
I take it back.
You haven't changed a bit.

147
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,610
You're still a manipulative bitch.

148
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:55,180
I drive by your office all the time.
Maybe I'll stop in and say hi.

149
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,640
You ever go near my workplace,it'll be the last thing you do.

150
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:18,130
- what was johanna talking about?
- I'm not sure.

151
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,690
It was...it was very complicated between those two.

152
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,960
Complicated how?

153
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,490
Well,they used to date before
johanna broke it off for jack.

154
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,120
I don't think porter ever got over her.

155
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,960
- He show up at the funeral?
- I paid for it,but I didn't go.

156
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,450
I wanted to remember jack and johanna as they were.

157
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,530
I never saw any of them again after that weekend.

158
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,930
First johanna dumps you and disses you.

159
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,960
Pissed you off pretty bad.

160
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,390
She had some dirt on you.
Maybe you stopped her from talking.

161
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,520
I'd never hurt johanna,never.

162
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,560
Funny.

163
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,010
You're still not telling us what she had on you.

164
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,660
Fine.

165
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,060
We were caught by campus security  one drunken night our freshman year.

166
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:02,910
For doing what?

167
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,910
Breaking into penn's rotc headquarters,smashing it up with a baseball bat.

168
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:11,160
Ten years later you're working for  a company with huge military contracts.

169
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:15,060
Let me guess.This little rotc incident wasn't on your resume?

170
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,870
- What do you think,einstein?
- I think you should answer "yes" or "no".

171
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,690
That all she had on you?

172
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,230
Yes.

173
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,120
Why do I know you're lying?

174
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,160
Porter.

175
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,340
You're a suspect in a double homicide.

176
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,830
We'll dig deep into your background,leave no stone unturned.

177
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,880
We're much more sympathetic to suspects  that do the digging for us.

178
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:40,210
Look,we were wanna-be che guevaras out to change the world.

179
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,350
So?

180
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,250
It's not what johanna had on me.

181
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,810
It's what z had on all of us.

182
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,170
hide the children!

183
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,050
You're gonna wash that seat off,right,z?

184
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,600
It ain't any bigger in real life,pal.

185
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,300
Enough,Z.

186
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,300
I got neighbors.

187
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,640
Now we care about what the neighbors think,jack?

188
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:22,240
Yeah.Yeah,'cause I'm the schmuck
with a nude houseguest riding a bike.

189
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,850
something is happening here

190
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:34,020
but you don't know what it is do you mr.Jones?

191
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:36,640
Knock it off,Z.

192
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:43,980
You don't know what it is do you,mr.Jones?

193
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,330
You want to say something to me?

194
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,850
Used to be my hero,jack.

195
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,970
Your words inspired me.

196
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,850
All of us.

197
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,580
What about the plans we had,man?

198
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,980
Was it ever about the cause,jack?

199
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,320
Or was it just about you hearing yourself talk?

200
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,430
Go to hell.

201
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,080
I'll see you there.

202
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,820
Mr.Jones.

203
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,000
Mr.Jones?

204
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,070
Jones family.

205
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,050
Radical underground student group in the '70s.

206
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,960
Espoused violence for a change.

207
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,210
I heard of them when I was on patrol.
Like the weathermen.

208
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,090
Used to plant bombs in public places to protest the vietnam war.

209
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,270
Violence to end wars.Makes sense.

210
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,480
- Jack was a member?
- We all kind of were.

211
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,750
Went to a few meetings,but...

212
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,560
I thought they were all nuts.

213
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,840
Bombing for peace was like humping for virginity.

214
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,220
just a few meetings?

215
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,600
That's it.

216
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,660
Fbi sent over photos of the jones family philly headquarters.

217
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,350
See what porter's definition of a few is.

218
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,140
Miller.In here.Now.

219
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,460
What's up?

220
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,330
How in the hell do you open this thing?

221
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,950
There's this new device called a straw.

222
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,650
Straw?

223
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,300
I didn't see that.

224
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,300
Why don't you let the four-year-old show you?

225
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,390
Hey,sean,how about some juice,buddy?

226
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,550
Sure.

227
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:56,380
You wanna go interview a murder suspect or something,boss?

228
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,220
Calm yourself down?

229
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,940
Fbi surveillance photos.

230
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,380
- The jones family.
- Porter's full of it.

231
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,630
- They were at a lot of meetings.
- Not sara,though.

232
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,930
No fbi files on any of them specifically.

233
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,980
Either they really only attended meetings...

234
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,420
or they were never caught blowing something up.

235
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,770
Well,one of them was handy with bombs.

236
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,950
- What do you got?
- College files.

237
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,890
Z took out a lot of student loans.

238
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:26,260
Paid them off working summers at helm drilling & blasting,big construction company.

239
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,030
- Blasting?
- Z worked demolition.

240
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,640
Peace-loving hippie was an expert with explosive devices.

241
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,260
WherRe you in '71?

242
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,620
Year out of the air force.
Worked a foot beat.

243
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,050
Any run-ins with these jones family punks?

244
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:48,150
Nah,worked crowd control at some protest marches.

245
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,320
Thousands gathered right here.

246
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,680
These kids ever go to class?

247
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,210
Who has time for class when there's a revolution going on?

248
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,120
Revolution,my ass.

249
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,180
Takes a silver spoon to have so much time to protest.

250
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,940
Most college kids' hearts were in the right place.

251
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,000
My uncle served two tours in vietnam.

252
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,470
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

253
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:10,210
Got home,walked through the airport,

254
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,030
and two of those good-hearted college students threw eggs in his face.

255
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,460
threw eggs in his face.

256
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,820
Complicated times,nick.

257
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,960
Just like today.

258
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,840
professor zimmerman?

259
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,190
to what do I owe the honor,detectives?

260
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,440
- How'd you know who we are?
- Oh,it's a talent I've long had.

261
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,770
For spotting guys that are gonna ruin your day?

262
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,320
Philly homicide.

263
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,070
Got a few questions about jack and johanna kimball.

264
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,870
Jack and johanna?

265
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,000
Turns out they were murdered back in '81.

266
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,830
Accidental explosion was really a bomb planted
behind their kitchen stove.

267
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:55,470
Reminiscent of what you and your pals
in the jones family used to do.

268
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,500
I...I can't believe this.

269
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,710
Understand you knew a thing or two about explosives.

270
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:06,150
And you were in a fight with jack at your little reunion party?

271
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,390
Jack and I...we worked it out.

272
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,730
Yeah?

273
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,190
- Where were you the night he died?
- I was already home.

274
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,810
- Alone?
- Yeah.

275
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:16,480
Great alibi,Z.Did the butler do it,too?

276
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,340
Look,um...

277
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,670
if anyone had a problem with jack that weekend...

278
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,350
it was sara.

279
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,080
I'm sorry I rode your bicycle naked

280
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,220
in a ronald reagan mask,jack.

281
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,750
Forget it.

282
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,880
Wouldn't be a party without seeing your ass.

283
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,540
I miss you,man.
That's all.

284
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,150
I miss how it used to be with all of us.

285
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,320
So do I.

286
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,980
- You know what I'm gonna do?
- What are you gonna do?

287
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,300
When I go home tomorrow...

288
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,200
I'm gonna propose to my girlfriend.

289
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,140
Well,I thought you didn't believe in the archaic,

290
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,620
oppressive bonds of marriage.

291
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,610
oh,you and johanna make it so cool.

292
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,030
With jo,it's kind of easy.

293
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,450
You learn to love the little things.

294
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,940
Need some help,sara?

295
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,610
Sara!What did you...

296
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,600
I should have it,too.

297
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,200
What you and johanna have.

298
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,480
What are you talking about?

299
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,350
Mcbride was the only person who ever loved me.

300
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,940
And you killed him.

301
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,860
Sara...I...I am sorry.

302
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,480
I thought I could move on.

303
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,460
I tried so hard.

304
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,030
You guys have made something of your lives.

305
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,530
If I died,if I vanished off the face of the earth tomorrow,

306
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,010
no one would even notice.

307
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,640
You're the one who should be dead,jack,not mcbride.

308
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,780
- Who's mcbride?
- Miss sara's boyfriend.

309
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:25,050
He was a gung-ho radical who was inspired  by jack's political writings.

310
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,600
Anything specific?

311
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,790
Jack had a catchphrase that caught on: "Peace at any cost.

312
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,510
- Meaning violence was okay?
- Yep.

313
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,410
At the time,penn's science center had a defense contract with the government.

314
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,610
Mcbride got a little carried away.

315
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,440
How so?

316
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,510
Well, he blew himself up planting a bomb there.

317
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,690
Your boyfriend died, and you blamed jack.

318
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,630
Ten years later you finally made him pay.

319
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,920
Ten years later I was a mess.

320
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,400
I didn't have the strength to get out of bed.

321
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,470
Maybe you called an old friend in the
jones family to do it for you.

322
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,540
The Jones family?

323
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,650
I was a pacifist.

324
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,150
Didn't believe in that.

325
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,370
But your boyfriend did.

326
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,900
Mcbride was a gentle soul.

327
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,160
He was the kindest guy I ever met.

328
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,900
Doesn't sound like the kind of guy
who could blow up a building on his own.

329
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,290
Mcbride had help, didn't he?

330
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,050
The bombing was jack's idea.

331
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,290
He recruited mcbride.

332
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,380
- They were all in on it.
- Who was?

333
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,640
Jack...porter...johanna, Z.

334
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,110
They were all in the science center
when it went off.

335
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,990
What about you?

336
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:51,760
They kept me in the dark. 
I didn't know until later.

337
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,900
That's some secret.

338
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,830
We were all dying inside.

339
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,040
Jack was the only one...

340
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,450
who couldn't live with it anymore.

341
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,030
What happened?

342
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,760
What happened is that ten years ago, we killed someone.

343
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,400
Jack.

344
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,170
What happened...is that none of us can live with it.

345
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,060
Look at sara.

346
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,670
Can't get up in the morning without a pill.

347
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,690
Z dulling the pain with booze.

348
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,930
Me?

349
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:40,740
Trying to buy peace of mind with bmws
and trips to aspen.

350
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,110
That's brilliant, dr.Freud.

351
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,280
It's the truth.

352
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,890
Fact is, that's really why I brought us all together.

353
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,490
You put mcbride's slide in there on purpose?

354
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,450
Maybe I did.

355
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,500
We promised never, ever to talk about this again.

356
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,000
Guess I'm breaking that promise.

357
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,440
Two weeks ago I got a call from mcbride's dad.

358
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,510
hello, jack.

359
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,540
Roger mcbride again.

360
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,980
I can't seem to reach you.

361
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:15,980
Anyway, it's ten years since we lost my boy,

362
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,520
and I've been thinking about you.

363
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,760
He really looked up to you, jack.

364
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,180
I think a part of his spirit lives in you,

365
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,850
and that comforts me.

366
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,160
I'll never understand why he did it.

367
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,600
He was my only son.

368
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,510
Time doesn't heal a damn thing.

369
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:39,580
It only makes it worse.

370
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,410
I haven't called him back.

371
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,610
I'm not sure what I'd say.

372
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,990
Maybe, um...

373
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:56,030
"hey, mr.Mcbride, "your son's death was actually my fault.

374
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:59,220
"I took a clean-cut kid and made a killer out of him.

375
00:22:59,220 --> 00:22:59,920
" Please stop this.

376
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,130
"He died "in my arms, and then i ran away like a coward.

377
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:06,020
"Washed his blood off my jeans "like it was dirt.

378
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,360
Can you ever forgive me?

379
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:15,010
" I'm sorry, but mcbride knew the risks.

380
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:17,550
He never would've been there
if I hadn't planned the whole thing.

381
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,390
We can't change the past.

382
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,540
But we can change the future.

383
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:25,180
The only way we're gonna heal is if the truth comes out.

384
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,860
The truth means we go to jail.

385
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,920
monday morning...

386
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,780
I'm going to the cops.

387
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,260
that was saturday.

388
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,930
We all left that night.

389
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,820
And sunday he was dead?

390
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,580
It looks like one of you went back to shut him up.

391
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,730
Well, I was proud of him.

392
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,510
Well, you had nothing to lose.

393
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:03,360
You weren't directly involved in mcbride's death.

394
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,800
Leaves porter and Z.

395
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,140
The boy closed the window.

396
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,890
"Then the boy closed his eyes.

397
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,360
And outside...

398
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,210
the barn and all the animals slept.

399
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,710
That's right.

400
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:26,780
Now, time for some shut-eye.

401
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,120
I don't wanna sleep.

402
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,000
I want to go home.

403
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,260
Oh, you gotta stay here tonight, pal.

404
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,590
Why?

405
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,700
Because your mom and dad are having a date.

406
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,140
Why?

407
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,520
it's grown-up stuff.

408
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:43,020
Time to hit the hay.

409
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,760
How come gramma rita doesn't live here?

410
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,030
Gramma rita's happy where she is.

411
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,180
Why?

412
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,400
Well...

413
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:06,460
gramma rita always used to wonder
when I'd be home, where I was.

414
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,820
It made her sad.

415
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,720
And now it's easier for gramma rita.

416
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,170
She doesn't have to worry and be sad because...

417
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:20,320
because she doesn't have to wait for me anymore.

418
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:29,040
Now, how 'bout we both get some sleep?

419
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,000
Can you read it to me again?

420
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,280
I just read it to you twice, pal.

421
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,850
One more time.Please.

422
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,790
All right.

423
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,640
"the sun came up and the rooster crowed...

424
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,730
we got z and porter in separate rooms.

425
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:59,780
Oh, play them against each other,
then pick the right time to shine the light.

426
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,390
What, talk a deal?

427
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:04,300
Ada thomas said she's willing to
take involuntary on mcbride

428
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,760
if one of them confesses to the kimball job.

429
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,900
Got it.

430
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,100
Well, legally the da can't lie to a suspect.

431
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,260
Ah, but we can.

432
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,400
I love this job.

433
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
- Janie.
- Hey, dad.

434
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:24,750
- Sean get off to school okay?
- Ah, piece of cake.

435
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,840
How many times did he get you to read the barnyard?

436
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,780
Twice.
Then he knew it was bedtime.

437
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,470
So, uh...how'd things go?

438
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:39,790
after you and mom, I promised myself I would never do this to sean.

439
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:43,060
You were so young...you remember that, janie?

440
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,790
I never forgot.

441
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,790
Well, sometimes it's not so simple.

442
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,880
It's not your fault.

443
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,260
I know.

444
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,410
So, how many times did you really read him the book?

445
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,690
Fell asleep on the fifth.

446
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,270
Tell us more about your pal, mcbride.

447
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,950
I already told you everything I know.

448
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,850
Porter says you and mcbride planted that bomb together.

449
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:23,900
Understand you were friends with paul mcbride.

450
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,120
Sara's boyfriend?

451
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,370
Your pal z says you and mcbride planted a bomb together.

452
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,370
You're going down for mcbride right now.

453
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:31,430
Unless...

454
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:34,170
unless you come clean about the kimballs' murder.

455
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:37,110
现在就交待否则你就无福消受你六居室的房子

456
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,860
for a six-by-nine cell

457
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,200
jack was going to the cops about mcbride.

458
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,860
I wanted to stop him.We all did.

459
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:51,880
- So you killed him.
- No.I tried to reason with him.

460
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,600
You're gonna shove us under a bus to end your real guilt.

461
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:57,860
My "real guilt"?

462
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,430
The fact that you peddle yummy bars to pay the mortgage.

463
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,770
It's felony murder, jack.
We could go away for a long time.

464
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:05,570
Yeah, prison with hard-core murderers.

465
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,790
You wanna repent?Do it on your own time.

466
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,580
It's 1981.

467
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:12,290
No one has sympathy for what
we were trying to accomplish in '71 we?

468
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,720
The whole plan was jack's idea.
Let's not forget that.

469
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,410
Well, I think jack's right.

470
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,580
Well, how brave of you,
seeing as you've got nothing at stake here.

471
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,990
We owe it to mcbride to tell the truth.

472
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:25,430
Guess what, sara?
When you weren't around, your precious love was

473
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:28,240
bagging every hot art major on campus,
so spare me his sainthood.

474
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,820
That's not necessary, porter.

475
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,300
She wanted truth; she can suck on it.

476
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,820
Johanna, what do you think?

477
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,980
what do you think?

478
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,330
Remember how we used to solve our disputes?

479
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:49,290
Simple vote.True democracy.

480
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,110
Don't you still believe in that, jack?

481
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,620
Fine.

482
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:03,460
Yes," we turn ourselves in; "no," we never discuss this again.

483
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:07,380
"no," we never discuss this again 

484
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,330
Sounds good.

485
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,260
Jack, I assume you're a still a "yes"?

486
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,940
Yes.

487
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,440
Yes.We turn ourselves in.

488
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,000
No way, jose.

489
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,130
I second that.

490
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,480
That's two "no"s, two "yes.

491
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,390
" Jo, you're the deciding vote.

492
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,570
No.

493
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:43,570
What?

494
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:45,800
I'm saying we don't go to the cops.

495
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,130
I say we bury this forever, 

496
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:50,290
once and for all. 

497
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,190
And with that, it was over.

498
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,200
And you all went on your merry way?

499
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,280
Well, it wasn't merry.

500
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,620
I'll tell you that.

501
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,510
We were just glad it was over.

502
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,620
And jack was gonna abide by the vote?

503
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,230
No way.No, not that guy.

504
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:20,120
What are you hiding, z?

505
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,530
I got nothing to hide.

506
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:26,870
The fact is...jack still couldn't let it go.

507
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:37,500
what we did, jo, it's killing us all.

508
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,890
Can't you see that?

509
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:41,290
And this is how we help each other?

510
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:45,400
I told sara she can stay with us for a while.
She needs us.

511
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,830
And we need to face what we did.

512
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,600
Mcbride is dead.

513
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,830
And it's awful and I'm sorry for his father,

514
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:54,230
but there's nothing we can do to bring him back.

515
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,950
But we can bring ourselves back.

516
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,670
Jack, you might be right about the others.

517
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:03,120
But I'm happy...with all that we have, with who we are.

518
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,710
- Jo, jo...
- I've fought so hard to get here, jack.

519
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,910
I can't start again.

520
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:10,630
I can't go back to being the poor kid with nothing.

521
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:19,810
remember what my mom used to say about the cattleyas?

522
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,660
I know.Family.

523
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,470
Yeah.

524
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:29,840
What about the family that we wanted to start?

525
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,600
Jack, we're finally ready.

526
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:35,320
I can't start anything right now.

527
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,970
That is the problem.

528
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:39,210
You saying you don't love me?

529
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:41,200
No, I'm saying that i have to make this right.

530
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,590
Even if that means going to jail?

531
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:46,510
Never seeing each other again.

532
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,470
but you're sure...johanna said that about the orchids?

533
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,660
Symbol of family?

534
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:05,220
Yeah.

535
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,830
The exact same thing sara told us.

536
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:14,130
According to z, sara was staying at the house a few more days.

537
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,890
Sara forgot to mention that little detail to us.

538
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:20,000
I ran her 1970 fingerprints against her current prints.

539
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,120
Thing is, they don't match.

540
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,080
But these do. 

541
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,400
Whose are they?

542
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,380
Johanna'S.

543
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:32,130
Sara lowell is really johanna kimball.

544
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:36,570
The real sara must've died in the blast.

545
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,980
Johanna stole her identity.

546
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,260
And ran.

547
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:48,820
Still no where abouts on johanna.

548
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,520
Mm.Running again.

549
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,210
Miller's talking to the family.

550
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:54,830
Hey, louie traced the serial number on the pipe cap

551
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:57,190
to a batch that was purchased by marshall corp.

552
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:59,500
Oh, where porter worked in '81.

553
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,810
Looks like we got our bomb-maker.

554
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:06,260
You stay in touch with sara after that weekend?

555
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,140
Sara?

556
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,260
We weren't exactly exchanging christmas cards.

557
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:13,670
I never saw her again.

558
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:17,340
We know you made the bomb, einstein.

559
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,990
And you had the hots for johanna.

560
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,670
I guess it doesn't matter.

561
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:26,280
She's been dead for so long.

562
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,050
It was johanna's idea...

563
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:31,850
but something went wrong. 

564
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,090
She wasn't supposed to be in the house.
Just jack.

565
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,810
Your best friend.

566
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:38,630
You gotta understand...

567
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:41,090
I did it for the woman I loved.

568
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:43,790
When did johanna come to you?

569
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,440
I was packing to leave...

570
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,170
jack's still going to the cops.

571
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,330
What?
I thought we all decided.

572
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,450
He doesn't care.

573
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:08,320
- Well, you got to stop him, jo.
- He won't listen to me.

574
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,330
He's throwing everything away, including me.

575
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,290
I'm scared, porter.

576
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:14,530
I'm scared, porter.

577
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,940
I'm so scared.

578
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,870
Maybe I was wrong about everything.

579
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,880
What do you mean?

580
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:27,160
The decisions I made back then about you and jack.

581
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,690
I have thought about it, you know.

582
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:33,960
That summer.

583
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:37,570
We were together.

584
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,970
Maybe this is a chance to start over.

585
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,670
Yeah, but in jail, on the run?

586
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:49,830
There's another way.

587
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:53,740
I keep thinking about jack's writings, his words.

588
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,430
"Peace at any cost.

589
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,540
" Yes.

590
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:10,070
What are we talking about, jo?

591
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,900
You and me not giving up what we've got.

592
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,910
You and me?

593
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:21,100
Yes.

594
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,610
It was a simple plan.

595
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,720
The stove knob triggered the bomb.

596
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,360
Jo should have been long gone, meeting me.

597
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,640
But she didn't show.

598
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,990
All I wanted was her,

599
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,490
and I...I killed her.

600
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,930
Sara was staying in the house, porter.

601
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:02,500
You killed her, not johanna.

602
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,730
Forgot to loop you in, huh?

603
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:09,510
Maybe that summer wasn't so special after all.

604
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,460
your daughter's good.

605
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,540
Thank you.

606
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,030
You've carved quite a life for yourself, haven't you?

607
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:27,890
Beautiful house, beautiful family.

608
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:32,010
I wonder what johanna would think of this.

609
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,730
Where was johanna from?

610
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,400
- Uh, new jersey.
- Right.

611
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,380
In a tiny apartment in newark, out-of-work father.

612
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:43,750
Grew up poor.

613
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,490
You do your homework.

614
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,930
Yeah, all of you came from money except for johanna.

615
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:53,800
She worked her way through school.

616
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:56,510
Struggled.

617
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:03,320
I bet she would have given anything to have this, done anything.

618
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:15,630
Please.

619
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:18,530
I know who you are, johanna.

620
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,510
Does it haunt you?

621
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,460
When you steal a life,
do you leave your soul behind?

622
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,600
Don't do this here, please.

623
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,880
Tell me what happened, johanna.

624
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:41,120
All I ever wanted was a family.

625
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,370
A garden...

626
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,490
peace.

627
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:48,930
And you killed for it.

628
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,960
I loved jack.

629
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,450
Strange way to show it.

630
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:58,170
I'm not a monster.

631
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:00,520
What are you then?

632
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:04,390
A coward.

633
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:12,590
Sara's taking a walk.

634
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,250
只有我们俩了

635
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,580
Let's go to bed, sweetie.

636
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:21,570
Tomorrow morning we should get on a plane and go somewhere,

637
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:24,600
- anywhere. 
- Jo, there's no running away.

638
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:29,720
We've been under a lot of stress with work,
with this reunion.

639
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,560
Let's take a break, you and me.

640
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,300
I can'T.

641
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:46,050
Remember that day?

642
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,840
We got a flat tire.

643
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:52,380
Pulled into a park.

644
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:55,730
Walked down to that lake.

645
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,680
Best flat tire I ever had.

646
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:07,930
I thought it was you and me against the world.

647
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:10,610
It still is.

648
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:13,410
Let's do this together.
Be strong with me, jo.

649
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,560
You always were the strong one.

650
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,960
It isn't strength.

651
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:24,080
It's like I don't have a choice.

652
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:29,110
No choice.

653
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:32,280
I think i understand now.

654
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:36,180
Good.

655
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:53,850
Let's go to bed.

656
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,280
I'll be up in a second.
