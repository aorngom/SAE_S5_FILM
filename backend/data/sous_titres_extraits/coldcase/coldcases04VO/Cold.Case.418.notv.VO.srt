The following story is fictional and does not depict any actual person or event.

September13,1999

3
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,400
I like that one,mommy.

4
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,280
you're right,abby.

5
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,660
It's beautiful.

6
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,130
Kind of looks like the old house.

7
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,270
Can we just get out of here,mom?

8
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,330
But I think it has a pool,natalie.

9
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,200
I could have a pool party.
For my birthday.

10
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,180
Hello,your birthday is in november.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,490
Mom.

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,310
Just a regular party then.

13
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,520
With a vanilla polar bear cake.

14
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,300
Don't hold your breath,ab.

15
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,300
November's still two months away.

16
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,270
And?

17
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,870
A lot can happen in two months.

18
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,410
We're the bradford girls.
We celebrate birthdays in style.

19
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,570
This year won't be any different.

20
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,470
This our spot,mommy?

21
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,630
Yeah,for tonight.

22
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,740
Are we really going to get a house like the one back there?

23
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,980
Of course we are,sweetie.

24
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,510
We can have any house we want.

25
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,790
One day.

26
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,660
hmm.Environmental group found it.
Testing the bottom of the lake.

27
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,110
- For what?
- That...stuff they test for.

28
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,400
Looks like this heap was submerged for years.

29
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,590
Wasn't the only thing submerged.

30
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,430
Marlene bradford.35 years old.

31
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,100
How'd you make the id?

32
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,830
Car's vin number.
Running dental records for verification now.

33
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,410
She was reported missing eight years ago.

34
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,790
Hmm,hot plate.

35
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,400
Hmm,tv,hangers.

36
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,050
- Looks like she was moving.
- Or living in her car.

37
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,790
Area's popular with the homeless.Has been for years.

38
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,470
A kid's doll.

39
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,790
Might have been a whole family.

40
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,000
- So what killed her?
- Small caliber weapon.

41
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,010
Could be a .38.

42
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,140
That explains marlene.

43
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,550
so where's the rest of the family?

44
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:30,400

47
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,050
marlene bradford,mother of two.

48
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,630
Reported missing november 17,1999.

49
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,090
Kids the last to see?

50
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,400
Yeah,natalie,14,abby,nine.

51
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,330
Told the cops mom dropped them off at school.
Never came back.

52
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,870
Both girls went into the system; we're locating them.

53
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,580
Marlene had a job at al's village market on broad street.

54
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,690
But she was still living in her car.

55
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,910
You try getting by on six bucks an hour with two kids.

56
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,710
Bullet's out to ballistics.Maybe we get a hit.

57
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,670
Car doesn't take a dive without making a splash.

58
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,840
Thinking some bum in the park saw something?

59
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,930
Shelf life's short on the street.

60
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,470
Transients disappear.

61
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,830
Do a canvas.
Maybe we get lucky.

62
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,210
Will...word in my office?

63
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,020
Sure thing.

64
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,220
- You went behind my back.
- Excuse me?

65
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,720
I know you got the name of the ex-trucker jersey's looking into.

66
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,160
- It's a free country.
- You need to back off,will.

67
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,960
He took my wife.

68
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,280
You got no business telling me what to do.

69
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,370
This guy's got it coming,no denying it,

70
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,820
but you do this,you're lost.

71
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,490
You know where mary was going
the night she died?

72
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,460
Dink's
That was our club.

73
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,740
I told her I'd meet her if I got off in time,but...

74
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,160
you worked late.

75
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,440
If I had been there,

76
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,830
she wouldn't have been left dying on the side of that road.

77
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,520
- It wasn't your fault,will.
- He's got to pay for that.

78
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,170
And he will.
Let jersey bring him in.

79
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,310
What I do with this is my business.

80
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,820
Someone shot my mom.

81
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,920
Who would do that?

82
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,570
Abby...

83
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,080
your mom have any enemies?

84
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,080
She was like a pta mom.No way.

85
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,580
But you'd been living on the streets.

86
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,340
For three months,yeah,

87
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,380
but it wasn't always like that.

88
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,010
We had a nice house,a yard.

89
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,530
So how'd you end up in the car?

90
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,600
Dad got cancer...

91
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,840
and everything changed.

92
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,180
The doctor bills wiped us out.

93
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,770
We lost everything.

94
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,950
Your mom have any run-ins on the street?

95
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,460
Honestly,I...I don't remember a lot about that time.

96
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,890
You don't remember being homeless?

97
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,240
It sounds weird,but...

98
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,420
what I remember from back then is my mom always being there.

99
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,840
is my mom always being there.

100
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,120
You were young.

101
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,720
Maybe your sister

102
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,760
natalie will remember more.

103
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,050
Me and natalie got separated in foster care.

104
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,070
I was lucky.I found a good family right away.

105
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,630
I take it natalie didn'T.

106
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,180
She was older.

107
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,290
No one wanted her for long.

108
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,900
We just kind of grew apart.

109
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,420
And she had changed anyway.

110
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,690
Changed how?

111
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,830
She believed mom took off,left us.

112
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,680
But now she'll know it wasn't that way,right?

113
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,580
You didn't believe that?

114
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,080
It was my tenth birthday.

115
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,590
I knew she wouldn't leave us.

116
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,640
Someone's going to talk to my sister,right?

117
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,050
Yeah.

118
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,320
Tell her I miss her.

119
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,010
ok.

120
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,650
Like I said,I don't have a mother.

121
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,530
She jumped ship way back.

122
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:09,900
We found her this morning at the bottom of fairmount lake.

123
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,990
She had been shot,natalie.

124
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,090
She probably did it to herself.

125
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,360
The ultimate escape.

126
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,210
You think your mother killed herself?

127
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,700
My mom was weak and helpless.

128
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,410
- She didn't know how to deal with life.
- It's a tough thing losing a spouse.

129
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,940
No excuse for being clueless.
She didn't even know how to balance a checkbook.

130
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,650
- Sounds like she got overwhelmed.
- And that's my problem how?

131
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,360
Any idea who might have had it out for your mother?

132
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Besides the bums,derelicts,and drug addicts who populated our new world?

133
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,420
Be specific,natalie.

134
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,060
The first night we lost the house,my mom brought us to a shelter in the city.

135
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,100
- Tough place to end up.
- You don't say.

136
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,600
Is this where we're going to live now,mommy?

137
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,550
No,baby.

138
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,620
This is only for tonight.

139
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,800
Just till I figure things out.

140
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,110
Which one is ours?

141
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,770
22.

142
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,750
What are you looking at?

143
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,890
- I think there must be a mix-up.
- There ain't no mix-up.

144
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,110
It's the last bed,and you ain't taking it from me.

145
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,450
But we were guaranteed this bed.

146
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,240
- The woman at intake said...
- you want this bed,take it.

147
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,470
Barbie here's going to be turning tricks in no time.

148
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,880
- Don't talk to my daughter like that.
- What are you going to do about it?

149
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,130
Hey,what is going on here?

150
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,120
Nothing.

151
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,100
I was assigned this bed.

152
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,410
- Vita.
- She don't even need a bed.

153
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,440
You know the rules.

154
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,260
Tell her to go sleep in that car I saw her pull up in.

155
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,510
Mothers with kids get the last bed.

156
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,630
I see you again,I'll kick your ass,bitch.

157
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,490
We stayed just that one night.

158
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,470
Figured we were safer in the car.

159
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:33,450
Maybe marlene bumped into this vita outside the shelter?

160
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,310
I already told you what happened.

161
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,970
Your mom shot herself.

162
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,030
Your sister abby doesn't think so.

163
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,350
She's young.

164
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,560
She'd like to see you.

165
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,110
She's with a good family now.
She doesn't need me.

166
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,030
Not going to replace you.

167
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,510
Maybe it isn't so bad if they did.

168
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,080
Yeah.I was mad-dogging that woman.

169
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,820
I was mad-dogging that woman.

170
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,570
So what?
Did more than that,vita.

171
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,150
- You threatened her.
- Not long after,she turned up dead.

172
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,530
Those were just words.I barely even remember her.

173
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,580
Well,a trip downtown might jog your memory.

174
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,830
I can't be skipping out on my shift.

175
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,310
I'm one paycheck away from being back on the street as it is.

176
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,490
- Then answer the question.
- You ever run into marlene again?

177
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,530
The truth,vita.

178
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,620
Yeah,I saw her,okay?

179
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,510
Where?

180
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:35,720
On her way to work at that store over on broad street.

181
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,150
Thought she was a little bitch.

182
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,550
A little bitch,huh?

183
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,090
But homegirl had more heart than I thought.

184
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,650
mommy,where you going?

185
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,570
mommy has to work the late shift tonight.

186
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,440
You're leaving us out here?

187
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,490
I'll be right there.

188
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,400
I can see you through the window.

189
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,930
We're the bradford girls.

190
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,110
we stick together.

191
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,700
I'm sick of going to school in clothes I slept in.

192
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,790
It's gross.

193
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,540
By the end of the month,we'll have a place of our own,

194
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,410
and all this will be a distant memory.

195
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,020
That's what you said last month.

196
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,350
This time it's going to happen.

197
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,450
just stay under the covers,

198
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,920
and no one will even know you're here.

199
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,090
no employee parking.Customers only.

200
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,770
- I know,mr.Patel...
- move the car.

201
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,260
What about my kids?

202
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,980
Take your kids home to the sitter.

203
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,180
I can't afford a sitter.

204
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,040
You don't like the rules,get another job.

205
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,130
I need this job.Please.

206
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:50,840
Rules are rules.

207
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,760
Get them out of here.Now.

208
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,000
well,maybe I'll call the ins.

209
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:05,130
Tell them about the illegals you have cleaning the store at night.

210
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,510
rules are rules.

211
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,300
I'm not moving my car.

212
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,430
You cross me?You'll regret it.

213
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:19,170
You'll regret it.

214
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,330
marlene started a war with her boss.

215
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,240
I could have told her.

216
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,640
You can't win a war with management.

217
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,040
Now,if you don't mind,I got to get back to work.

218
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,640
Hi.Welcome to blue mart.

219
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,010
That was ballistics.

220
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,030
Well,they got a hit on the bullet found in marlene's car?

221
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,740
- From a .38 colt revolver.
- Oh,that's specific.

222
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,390
And guess who owns one?

223
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,580
Marlene's boss.

224
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,570
Lost your business,anil.

225
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,530
For hiring illegals.

226
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,390
Common practice.

227
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,230
The big superstores pay a fine.

228
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,780
Me?Ruined.

229
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,940
Maybe you blamed marlene bradford?

230
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,220
Maybe it's 'cause of her you got to wear this clown suit.

231
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,540
What are you talking about?
Marlene was a good employee.

232
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,640
- That superstore was the rat.
- Then why'd you shoot her?

233
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,360
She's dead,it was your gun that killed her.You know what?

234
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,270
I'm seeing a new uniform in your future,anil.
Bright orange jumpsuit.

235
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,970
- I bought that gun for the store.
- And you killed marlene with it.

236
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,080
No,you don't understand.I gave it to her.

237
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,740
Sure you did.

238
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,320
I did.

239
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,800
For her own protection.

240
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,050
Mommy,the water's cold.

241
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,950
I know.

242
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,910
I'm sorry,baby.

243
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:11,360
How come you can't get an office job like sarah's mom?

244
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,720
'Cause mom can't find her way out of a paper bag.

245
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,170
Not a lot of job openings for housewives with one year of college.

246
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:21,320
what the hell is going on here?

247
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,680
sorry,mr.Patel.

248
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,150
the girls needed a place to wash up before school.

249
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,760
Look,we're staying across town.

250
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,630
You said no babysitter.

251
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,970
But there's no house,is there?

252
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,890
no one for you to stay with?

253
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,350
No family?

254
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,600
I just need a little more time

255
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,650
to scrape up first and last month's rent,
and then I'll be able to find a place.

256
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,420
Please.

257
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,870
You can use the facility anytime you want,

258
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,380
but the parking...

259
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,970
I'm sorry.

260
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:13,190
If the customers can't park,they find another store,and I'm out of business.

261
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,900
I just don't know where else to go,here it's safe.

262
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,820
Oh,I know a place.

263
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:22,840
over there at,uh,fairmount park at the,uh,sweet briar cutoff.

264
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,810
Uh,don't let the looks of me stop you.

265
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:31,380
it ain't the ritz,but you're not going to be there long anyway.

266
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,000
You're onto sunnier shores real soon.

267
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,030
you're one of the lucky ones.I can tell.

268
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:39,160
I can tell.

269
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,500
thank you.

270
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,610
here.For you.

271
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:09,060
you're all alone.To grow old protect yourself.

272
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,910
- I can't take that.
- You have to.

273
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,710
Think about your girls.

274
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:18,070
Everybody needs a helping hand.

275
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,850
land of plenty?

276
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,180
Not for people like marlene.

277
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,800
So who was this homeless dude?

278
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,060
Name's hopper.A regular.

279
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,160
Came in for his daily lottery ticket.

280
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,590
You said fairmount park at sweet briar?

281
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,340
Definitely.

282
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,870
That's where marlene's body was found.

283
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,190
Well,canvas struck out.

284
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,340
Hard to believe anybody would stick around here for eight years.

285
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,060
I thought will was coming with.

286
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,870
Had something to do.

287
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,300
- Like what?
- Wouldn't say.

288
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,740
Vincent hopper?

289
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,620
Philly P.D.

290
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,410
Wanted to talk to you about a woman named marlene bradford?

291
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:17,690
Her body was found near here in the lake.

292
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,790
she didn't deserve that.

293
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,920
One in a million,that marlene.Nicest kids.

294
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,470
You directed her here back in '99.

295
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:32,090
I thought we'd be celebrating our move to sunnier shores together.

296
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,980
Well,looks like she wasn't the only one who didn't make it.

297
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,630
Ah,run of bad luck.

298
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,670
Put me behind schedule.

299
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,740
You're lucky I'm still here.

300
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,000
There's a change around the corner,you know?

301
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:49,000
You know something about marlene's disappearance?

302
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,660
Marlene wasn't meant for the streets.

303
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,140
Last time I saw her,it was only getting worse.

304
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,010
Nat,you're supposed to be in the car with abby.

305
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,490
I got to use the john if you don't mind.

306
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,540
You couldn't have taken her with you?

307
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,640
Jeez,can't I even take a pee without her?

308
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,660
And anyway,she's sound asleep.

309
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:32,220
ah,she's just being a teenager.

310
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,250
she's better than most of them around here.

311
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,730
You know everybody here,don't you?

312
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,300
After a few years,it gets easy.

313
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,470
Years?

314
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,000
But that's not going to be you.

315
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:49,560
It's abby's birthday tomorrow.

316
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,110
I can't even get her a cake.

317
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,170
Here.

318
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,010
It's a hope ticket.

319
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,020
A hope ticket?

320
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,230
Lets you dream about what you'd do with the winnings.

321
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:09,150
A million dollars.

322
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,930
Deal is,if you win,you got to share the wealth.

323
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,840
50-50.

324
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,480
Think of it as a finder's fee.

325
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,480
What would you do with a half a million dollars?

326
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,910
Oh,I'd get my family back.

327
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,270
Half a mill?

328
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:31,840
I could provide for my boy and his mom.

329
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,490
Like I should.

330
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,600
How old were you in this picture?

331
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,900
My son's got his eye set on this special glove.

332
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,920
and I mean to get it for him.

333
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,010
Then I'm sure you will.

334
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,800
- Mom! 
- What's the matter?

335
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,600
гн The car,it's gone.
гн What?!

336
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,380
- Where's abby?
- I don't know,mom!

337
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,160
- Where's your sister?
- She was in the car!

338
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,160
The car disappeared with abby in it?

339
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,830
Guess she wasn't so lucky after all.

340
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,440
That happened the night before marlene was murdered.

341
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,190
So,what did marlene do?

342
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,980
What any mother would do.
She panicked.

343
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,930
whoa.Scared the crap out of me,buddy.

344
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,590
Just closing up.

345
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,970
You need something?

346
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,680
Winter of '95 was really something.

347
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,580
Yeah,it was.

348
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,510
Can't get it out of my mind.

349
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,370
Yeah,right.Well,you know,I-I should finish closing.

350
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:04,260
My wife was killed that night.

351
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,410
Hit-and-run trucker.

352
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,660
But you know that,don't you?

353
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,960
- No. 
- She didn't die right away.

354
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,320
- Oh,please.
- Took a while.

355
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,450
Please.I-I...

356
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:21,730
what-what-what do you...want?Money?A-anything.

357
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,870
What do you think you can possibly give me?

358
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,950
I-I don't know.I...

359
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:29,250
- you left her there to die.
- Please.It was an accident.

360
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,450
You drove away.

361
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:35,380
- Close your eyes.
- No.Please-don't do this.

362
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,930
- Please.
- I said,close your eyes.

363
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:51,330
No child abduction reports filed the night
marlene's station wagon went missing.

364
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,910
Car wasn't even reported stolen.

365
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,570
Doesn't make sense.
Losing a kid-- parent's worst nightmare.

366
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,470
Do almost anything to get them back.

367
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,350
So why not file a report?

368
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,190
Maybe marlene knew who stole it.

369
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:06,150
Or maybe she got spooked.
Cops could start asking questions.

370
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,440
Like what was abby doing alone in the car in the first place?

371
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,320
- Single mother living on the streets.
- State could take both girls.

372
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,710
Easily.

373
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:15,550
But her kid's missing.
Think it's a chance she'd take.

374
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,700
The car was at a public park.
Lot of restrictions.

375
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,160
Yeah?

376
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,290
What if it got towed?

377
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,220
Marlene bradford.

378
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,020
Her car got towed november '99,by you.

379
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,150
Fellas,you know how many cars I tow?

380
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,720
Her car had a kid in it.
That ring any bells?

381
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,540
According to the records,marlene racked up over $200 in fines.

382
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,670
And she didn't have that kind of dough.

383
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,780
But somehow she got her wheels back.

384
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,570
Like I said,I don't remember.

385
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,210
Look,bro...

386
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:57,020
I've waived a few tickets in my day.

387
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,460
And they weren't nearly as hot as marlene.

388
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,260
You remember that,uh,,red camaro?

389
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,650
Oh.She stripped a few gears.

390
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,100
I bet you fellas get over a lot,huh?

391
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,390
Eh,yeah.

392
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,650
- Job don't pay nothing,huh?
- Gotta make it up somehow.

393
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,880
Yeah,damn right.

394
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,890
That what happened with marlene?

395
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,580
You cut her a deal?

396
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,650
Yeah,you could say that.

397
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,770
Hey,nothing comes for free,if you know what I mean.

398
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,590
mommy is so sorry,baby.

399
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:40,180
I promise I'll never leave you like that again.

400
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:45,120
I knew you'd come get me 'cause tomorrow's my birthday.

401
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,510
It's amazing you'll even be alive to see it.

402
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,540
- Natalie... 
- what?

403
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,370
- And she could've been killed,mom.
- You don't think I know that?

404
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,960
Just go inside,where it's warm,

405
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,200
while I go talk to the driver.

406
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,960
All right,it's going to be $279.

407
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,990
I get paid tomorrow.Maybe I could come...

408
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:13,850
look,save it.
You want your ride tonight,lady,you pay for it.

409
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,270
No,you don't understand.

410
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:18,890
If I don't get this car out of here,
my kids don't have anywhere to sleep tonight.

411
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,520
That's not my problem,lady.

412
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,260
Look...

413
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:30,080
I got something in the car.

414
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,460
You could get a lot of cash for it.

415
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,280
- Like?
- A gun.

416
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,430
it's right here.

417
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:48,380
it was right here!It was right here!

418
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,710
You stole it!

419
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,290
Look,you want your ride or not?

420
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:56,850
I can't leave here without it.My girls...

421
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:08,700
other ways to settle that tab,lady.

422
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,400
What?

423
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:16,300
we've got nowhere else to go,please.

424
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:19,180
Mom?

425
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:22,130
what's taking so long?

426
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,750
just go back inside,baby.

427
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:30,450
I'll be there in a minute.

428
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,840
hey,what the he?

429
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,980
her kids were in the next room.

430
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,090
- You took the gun,too,didn't you?
- That's crazy.

431
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,890
It didn't just walk away,dirtbag.

432
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:59,630
Hey,it was that girl.

433
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:01,850
- What girl?
- The one that was in the car.

434
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,800
Look,I saw her take something out of the glove box that night.

435
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,730
Abby took the gun?

436
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,380
Time to stop pretending you don't remember,abby.

437
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,310
I'm not pretending.

438
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,130
Certain things you don't forget...

439
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,180
like being in a car that's getting towed.

440
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,480
And taking the gun that killed your mom.

441
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,590
I got scared.

442
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:24,810
I saw the tow truck driver,and I grabbed it.

443
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,730
What about after?

444
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,940
Dangerous-- having a gun in close quarters like that.

445
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,390
Maybe it went off accidentally.

446
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:37,130
Maybe you got tired of your mother's empty promises.

447
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:40,890
- They weren't empty promises.
- You were living in a car,abby.Come on.

448
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,770
My mom did her best.

449
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:46,150
Everything she did was for us.

450
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:50,290
Only natalie didn't see it.

451
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:10,230
- promise not to tell mom?
- Whatever,stop being a baby.

452
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,720
- What are you doing with that?
- It was in the glove box.

453
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,040
It's not a toy,abby!

454
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,160
I wasn't playing with it!I...

455
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,650
there must be,like,50 cans in there.

456
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:25,170
We hit the jackpot tonight,girls.

457
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,170
How much will we get for these?

458
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,640
Lots.

459
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,060
Guess what we're going to do with the money?

460
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,040
Something for my birthday?

461
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,600
Something special.

462
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,280
Like what?

463
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,140
Some cake you got out of the garbage?

464
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,680
Natalie,please.

465
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,560
So how did you get the car back?

466
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:53,080
I sold the gun.

467
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,350
I know what you did.

468
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:10,650
- I'll get us out of this.
- How?

469
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,680
By showing us houses we're never going to live in?

470
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,390
We're better off without you and your stupid fantasy world.

471
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,950
- Stop it,natalie.
- You're disgusting!

472
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,120
- I hate you!
- You don't mean that.

473
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,630
I wish it was you that died instead of dad.

474
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,020
Nat,

475
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:33,270
I'm sorry,baby!

476
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,700
Natalie!

477
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,460
Natalie,come back!

478
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,970
Nat!

479
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,130
Natalie!

480
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,510
natalie loved mom.
She didn't mean it.

481
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,660
But she left with the gun.

482
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,600
And the next night your mom was dead.

483
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,040
Hey,john.

484
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,850
Come on in.

485
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:17,560
You haven't picked up your phone all day.

486
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,650
All this time...

487
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:26,630
he wasn't what I imagined.

488
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,850
What did you do,will?

489
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:32,300
I followed him into the alley.

490
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,990
It was dark,raining.

491
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,420
Go on.

492
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,980
I put my gun to his chest.

493
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:49,680
But I couldn't do it.

494
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,310
I wanted him to be a monster.

495
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,270
But he wasn'T.

496
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:11,330
He was just a guy in a diner.

497
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,360
I thought...

498
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,250
if I could do it...

499
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:23,670
it would make it better.

500
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,090
It won'T.

501
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,710
You did the right thing.

502
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,540
That night at dink's,

503
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,890
they were playing miles davis,

504
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,990
her favorite.

505
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,950
I...

506
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:48,580
haven't played one of his records since.

507
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,470
It's been 12 years.

508
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,500
A long time,will.

509
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,660
Yeah,it feels like yesterday.

510
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:10,550
She's not coming back,is she,john?

511
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,950
No,she's not.

512
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,130
Things got ugly with you and your mom.

513
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:51,200
"I hate you.
Wish you were dead."

514
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,860
Harsh words.

515
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,320
I was a kid.Kids mouth off.

516
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,280
Difference is,you had the gun that killed her.

517
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:02,100
You got something to say,say it.

518
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,150
At 14,it all seemed so black and white.

519
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:07,440
Life sucks because you have a lousy mother.

520
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,820
What do you know about it?

521
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:12,050
More than I'd like to.

522
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,510
Yeah,we all got problems,lady.

523
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,840
- I'm out of here. 
- Sit down.

524
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:23,730
No money.No husband.

525
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,900
No family.Two kids to raise.

526
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,550
Your mom deserved better from you.

527
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:30,300
She filled our heads with empty promises and lies!

528
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,210
She was trying to protect you.

529
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,190
She didn't protect us.

530
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,320
She left us when we needed her the most.

531
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,150
But she came looking for you,didn't she,natalie?

532
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,590
After you ran off.

533
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,260
Yeah,she found me.

534
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,130
Where?

535
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,470
Home.

536
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,640
I thought I might find you here.

537
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:20,770
You have every right to be angry.

538
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:30,060
But I'm doing my best,natalie.

539
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,980
Why can't you be real for once,mom?

540
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:36,150
You want to know what's real,nat?

541
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:39,090
I never thought I'd be a widow.

542
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:43,220
I never thought I'd lose our home.

543
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,340
Your dad always took care of everything.

544
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:48,060
All I had to do was love you and your sister.

545
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,870
Maybe it's not enough,mom-- love.

546
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,460
It's all I've got.

547
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:09,340
How could he die on me?

548
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:15,860
Still got each other,mom.

549
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:21,410
The bradford girls,remember?

550
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,460
we stick together.

551
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,300
We got to go forward with what we've got.

552
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,320
Still got this,too.

553
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:39,630
- A lottery ticket?
- It's a hope ticket.

554
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,700
It's worth a try,right?

555
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,420
It's a winner.

556
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,070
25 bucks.

557
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:58,830
Looks like abby gets her polar bear cake,after all.

558
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:01,870
And I can still pay the finder's fee.

559
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:05,060
How about I drive you to school?

560
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,600
And when you and abby get home,

561
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,570
we'll have a real birthday celebration.

562
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:17,490
We waited for hours after school for her to show.

563
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,500
I was an idiot to believe her.

564
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:25,200
What about the gun,natalie?

565
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,510
I gave it back to my mom.

566
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,570
Your mom said something about paying a finder's fee?

567
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,790
I don't know what she meant.

568
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:43,320
Means you weren't the last to see her that day.

569
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,660
You lied,hopper.

570
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,920
Me?Lie?

571
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,650
We know marlene came looking for you,

572
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:57,070
to pay the finder's fee.

573
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:00,350
Was just your luck,that ticket being a winner.

574
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:02,080
What are the chances,right?

575
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,100
It's news to me.I had no idea.

576
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,620
Oh,I think you did.

577
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,800
So what happened,hopper?You get greedy?

578
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,650
Wanted the 25 bucks all to yourself?

579
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,710
25 bucks?It was a million dollars.

580
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,920
Yeah,right.

581
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,010
A million.

582
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,850
She was lucky.

583
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,600
I know how to pick 'em,always did.

584
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,410
You sure do.

585
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:37,960
Just didn't count on her cheating you like that.

586
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,520
She had no right taking what was mine.

587
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,950
So you took it back-- your share.

588
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:45,040
Damn right.It was my ticket.

589
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,930
Was my chance.

590
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:49,030
To get off the streets?

591
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,110
To...

592
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,640
get my world back.

593
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:59,790
And everything in it.

594
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:05,050
Hopper!

595
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,080
- we won,hopper!
- What?

596
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,070
The lottery ticket.

597
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,050
It's a winner.

598
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,270
Ah,I knew it.

599
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,600
what did I say?!

600
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,890
One in a million,right?!

601
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,150
here.

602
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:28,650
Come look at the birthday cake I got for abby.

603
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,860
Wait,this is $12.

604
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,510
Where's the rest of it?

605
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,780
- what do you mean?
- The million we won.

606
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,490
Million?

607
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,750
hopper,you know how this works.

608
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,550
You're lucky if you win two bucks.

609
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:47,080
No,I'm going to get my wife back.

610
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,560
I'm going to play baseball with my son.

611
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:52,680
He wants that special glove,and I'm going to get it for him.

612
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,390
Hopper...

613
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:57,310
that picture was from a long time ago.

614
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,680
You know that.

615
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,970
No,no.

616
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:03,500
I promised my boy that glove.

617
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,000
Your son's not a kid anymore.

618
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:10,440
He's a grown man.

619
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,970
He is?

620
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,880
What's past is past.

621
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:20,960
We got to move on with what we've got.

622
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,150
You're just trying to keep the money for yourself.

623
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:28,260
No,that's crazy.

624
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,610
Now,where is it?!

625
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:31,480
What are you...what are you doing?!

626
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,490
Fabby's birthday cake!

627
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,180
I know it's here.

628
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,080
you can't take what's mine.

629
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,710
What have you done?

630
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,930
It's my ticket.

631
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,850
Hopper,don'T.

632
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,950
It's my hope.
