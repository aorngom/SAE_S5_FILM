1
00:01:24,382 --> 00:01:25,398
Are we good?

2
00:02:26,924 --> 00:02:28,388
I have to check it.

3
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:12,364
I have it.

4
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:15,537
It's real.

5
00:03:16,505 --> 00:03:17,520
Money first.

6
00:03:17,935 --> 00:03:19,985
He says money first.

7
00:03:49,526 --> 00:03:51,427
Nice doing business with you.

8
00:04:00,864 --> 00:04:02,074
What did I miss?

9
00:04:03,953 --> 00:04:04,677
Iggy.

10
00:04:08,835 --> 00:04:10,320
Who the hell are you?

11
00:04:13,117 --> 00:04:14,641
Weasel, don't. I--

12
00:04:17,151 --> 00:04:19,256
My friend marco here
made a silly mistake,

13
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:21,652
and sold you something
that belongs to me.

14
00:04:21,653 --> 00:04:24,881
Now, I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to take it back.

15
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,770
Get out.

16
00:04:32,367 --> 00:04:33,597
Easy.

17
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:42,701
Why does he keep
clicking that pen, man?

18
00:04:42,702 --> 00:04:43,918
Shoot him!

19
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:03,163
Robbery?

20
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,152
Doesn't look like
the register's been touched.

21
00:05:12,047 --> 00:05:13,812
Smells like somebody
had a barbecue.

22
00:05:21,077 --> 00:05:22,100
Somebody did.

23
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:24,590
What the hell happened
to you, friend?

24
00:05:40,961 --> 00:05:42,357
I thought we had two bodies.

25
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:45,292
We do.

26
00:06:01,484 --> 00:06:02,473
Ruby.

27
00:06:03,551 --> 00:06:04,579
Hello, peaches.

28
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,061
Nice homicides.

29
00:06:07,062 --> 00:06:09,838
- Only the best for you, Ruby.
- Who's our friend, the owner?

30
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:12,079
Uh, manager. Jake Scuillo.

31
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,863
Owner's a guy named
Karl Kreutzfeld. Not present.

32
00:06:14,864 --> 00:06:16,523
Ruber, you got a cause of death?

33
00:06:16,524 --> 00:06:18,596
Funny you should ask me that,
because no.

34
00:06:18,725 --> 00:06:21,226
- How 'bout burnt to a crisp?
- How 'bout not?

35
00:06:21,227 --> 00:06:25,561
Look it. The clothes.
They should have lit up first.

36
00:06:25,597 --> 00:06:28,344
What, they torched him,
then they dressed him?

37
00:06:28,508 --> 00:06:29,817
Electrocuted, maybe.

38
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,931
What about our superhero?

39
00:06:33,932 --> 00:06:37,160
Marco Cordova.
Customer, apparently.

40
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:40,994
Neck's broken, like he was
shot out of a cannon.

41
00:06:42,556 --> 00:06:44,464
This doesn't make any sense.

42
00:06:44,476 --> 00:06:46,348
You guys might want
to call the cops.

43
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:50,809
I mean, thrown against
the wall, okay. But this-

44
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,292
We've got a possible witness.

45
00:06:53,821 --> 00:06:55,178
Ignacio llosa.

46
00:06:56,668 --> 00:06:59,022
- Punched in. Never punched out.
- Oh, jeez.

47
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:01,471
- You know him, Joe?
- Yeah,

48
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,265
he's a sweet kid, but he's got
a nightmare family.

49
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,692
Let's pick him up.

50
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:14,914
Mr. Montague,

51
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:16,978
I gotta go to work
in the morning.

52
00:07:17,287 --> 00:07:19,869
I'd kinda like to get some
sleep tonight at some-

53
00:07:21,701 --> 00:07:25,384
Maybe you should have thought
about that before you lost the key.

54
00:07:29,986 --> 00:07:31,806
We gotta find that kid.

55
00:07:32,557 --> 00:07:33,383
Make a left.

56
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,771
Kathy and me are going up
to the lake this weekend.

57
00:07:42,772 --> 00:07:44,380
You and Anna can come, if you want.

58
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,316
You don't have to invite us
every time you go up there, Lou.

59
00:07:47,317 --> 00:07:49,621
Are you kidding?
Kathy loves that kid.

60
00:07:52,618 --> 00:07:53,880
What did your lawyer say?

61
00:07:54,603 --> 00:07:56,463
Vanessa might have a case.

62
00:07:56,781 --> 00:07:59,575
You're her father.
You stuck around.

63
00:07:59,951 --> 00:08:01,680
You're not gonna lose that kid.

64
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,739
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop stop.

65
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,666
That's Iggy.

66
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,616
Iggy! Stop!

67
00:08:32,492 --> 00:08:33,655
Iggy!

68
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:41,328
Iggy, open up.

69
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,122
Hang on.

70
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:49,770
Where is he?

71
00:08:59,017 --> 00:09:00,195
He's gone.

72
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:12,355
I want that cop's name.

73
00:09:14,741 --> 00:09:15,966
Can I be done?

74
00:09:16,961 --> 00:09:18,462
- Okeydoke.
- Thank you.

75
00:09:18,463 --> 00:09:20,406
Hey, hey, hey.
Dishes, missy.

76
00:09:23,165 --> 00:09:24,223
How was school today?

77
00:09:25,654 --> 00:09:27,932
Billy Frazier brought in
a huge earthworm.

78
00:09:27,933 --> 00:09:29,799
- Yeah?
- I touched it.

79
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:32,934
- Disgusting.
- Yeah.

80
00:09:32,935 --> 00:09:33,679
Come here.

81
00:09:34,258 --> 00:09:35,512
Let me see your hand.

82
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,691
- Ew, I can still feel the slime!
- No, you can't!

83
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:41,570
I can. Oh--

84
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:45,621
Miller.

85
00:09:45,622 --> 00:09:46,866
We just picked up Iggy.

86
00:09:46,867 --> 00:09:49,073
<i>At his mom's.
You better get in here, Joe.</i>

87
00:09:49,074 --> 00:09:50,470
I'll be right there.

88
00:09:57,718 --> 00:09:59,620
- Hi, Lee.
- Hi, Anna baby.

89
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,660
You got Iggy?

90
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,203
You need the interview room?

91
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:04,650
No, my office.

92
00:10:05,532 --> 00:10:06,522
You mind?

93
00:10:14,034 --> 00:10:16,177
You swore to me I'd
never see you in here.

94
00:10:17,381 --> 00:10:18,396
You swore.

95
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,270
Look at me when
i'm talking to you!

96
00:10:22,242 --> 00:10:23,797
Two men got burnt to death.

97
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:25,360
Tell me what happened.

98
00:10:27,214 --> 00:10:29,562
- I can't.
- You can't?

99
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:32,719
Your old man would have killed you
if your mom hadn't killed him first.

100
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,759
I convinced the D.A.
it was self-defense. I lied for you.

101
00:10:37,616 --> 00:10:39,598
If I tell you, my mom's dead.

102
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,524
I'll protect her.
I promise.

103
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,408
But, detective Joe,
who's gonna protect you?

104
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:07,824
Nice watch.

105
00:11:08,017 --> 00:11:09,714
- Can I use the bathroom?
- No.

106
00:11:10,935 --> 00:11:13,419
- I feel like i'm gonna puke.
- I'll bet you do.

107
00:11:17,257 --> 00:11:18,303
What's this?

108
00:11:21,707 --> 00:11:24,226
You have an apartment.
What's with the motel key?

109
00:11:26,909 --> 00:11:29,228
You don't know what motel
you're staying in?!

110
00:11:29,229 --> 00:11:30,634
It's not a real place.

111
00:11:32,035 --> 00:11:32,599
What?

112
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,681
- I'm gonna puke. I'm gonna go to the...
- Sit down! Sit down!

113
00:11:36,382 --> 00:11:40,160
You're not going anywhere until you tell me
what's going on. Now, what is going on?

114
00:11:40,653 --> 00:11:42,243
Just tell me what happened.

115
00:11:42,732 --> 00:11:44,211
How'd he burn'em?

116
00:11:45,987 --> 00:11:47,596
Three dudes came in.

117
00:11:47,936 --> 00:11:49,627
I never seen them before.

118
00:11:49,662 --> 00:11:52,233
The main guy,
they called him the weasel.

119
00:11:52,362 --> 00:11:53,343
How did he burn 'em?

120
00:11:55,984 --> 00:11:57,800
How did he burn 'em, Iggy?
Tell me.

121
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:03,429
Iggy!

122
00:12:37,953 --> 00:12:39,303
I got the phone records.

123
00:12:41,348 --> 00:12:44,705
Our fried guy called his boss
just before he got killed.

124
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:46,268
His boss?

125
00:12:46,538 --> 00:12:48,921
The guy who owns the pawn shop
Karl Kreutzfeld.

126
00:13:02,632 --> 00:13:04,581
<i>That's so awesome.</i>

127
00:13:11,643 --> 00:13:13,051
Happy birthday, Isaac.

128
00:13:14,103 --> 00:13:16,206
Time for cake an icecream, come on!

129
00:13:17,305 --> 00:13:20,083
Mr. Kreutzfeld, did you make all this
money in a pawn shop?

130
00:13:20,103 --> 00:13:21,106
Oh God, no.

131
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:24,057
No, I own a chain of dry cleaners.

132
00:13:24,058 --> 00:13:25,485
I admit, it's ridiculous

133
00:13:25,486 --> 00:13:28,707
how much people pay to have
their clothes washed without water.

134
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:29,982
The...

135
00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:33,030
pawn shop is my grandfather's. Was.

136
00:13:34,071 --> 00:13:35,113
Now it's mine.

137
00:13:35,962 --> 00:13:37,484
It was his life, actually. He...

138
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,231
loved things.

139
00:13:39,617 --> 00:13:43,225
Show me your things, and I can tell you
your life story. Something like that.

140
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:46,467
Please understand, I've never
had an employee

141
00:13:46,468 --> 00:13:48,647
killed on the job before.
This is

142
00:13:48,801 --> 00:13:51,000
very disturbing, to say the least.

143
00:13:51,193 --> 00:13:53,797
Jake Scuillo called you just
before the time of the murders.

144
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,654
Yeah, he wanted to know about
closing up early. Business was slow,

145
00:13:56,655 --> 00:13:57,995
which is not unusual.

146
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:01,627
What about your other employee,
Ignacio Llosa?

147
00:14:05,388 --> 00:14:06,546
Make a wish, Isaac.

148
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:13,973
Did he mention anything
about a key?

149
00:14:16,346 --> 00:14:17,234
A key?

150
00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:19,993
No, he didn't say anything
about a key.

151
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,783
I'm sorry I'm so distracted today.

152
00:14:24,053 --> 00:14:26,311
If there's anything else
I can do, to help,

153
00:14:26,485 --> 00:14:30,382
please call me. I sincerely hope you
catch this son of a bitch.

154
00:14:31,095 --> 00:14:31,751
Thank you.

155
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:33,798
I don't care about the money.

156
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:35,360
I just want to get rid of it.

157
00:14:35,785 --> 00:14:37,425
I'm in a parking lot.

158
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:38,428
Hello?

159
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,296
Jennifer?

160
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:44,790
I've got it here.
Where are you?

161
00:14:46,623 --> 00:14:47,915
Hello, Jennifer?

162
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:20,125
- So, what do you want to watch tonight?
- Nemo.

163
00:15:21,302 --> 00:15:22,691
Again? Come on.

164
00:15:23,502 --> 00:15:24,216
How about

165
00:15:24,505 --> 00:15:25,605
Abbot & Costello?

166
00:15:26,338 --> 00:15:27,303
Nemo.

167
00:15:27,747 --> 00:15:29,483
Abbot & Costello meet Frankenstein?

168
00:15:30,671 --> 00:15:32,446
Come on, it's got Frankenstein.

169
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,182
Stay there.

170
00:15:59,178 --> 00:16:00,914
Anna, go to your room, now!

171
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:03,345
Iggy?

172
00:16:05,058 --> 00:16:06,659
I'm sorry, detective Joe.

173
00:16:10,287 --> 00:16:11,560
Hang in there, all right?

174
00:16:13,141 --> 00:16:14,685
This is detective Joe Miller.

175
00:16:14,686 --> 00:16:17,212
I need an ambulance.
I've got a kid bleeding to death.

176
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:18,402
I'm sorry.

177
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:20,678
There's no one else.

178
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:22,897
They double-crossed me.

179
00:16:24,247 --> 00:16:25,077
I'm sorry.

180
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,548
I'm sorry...

181
00:16:27,397 --> 00:16:28,130
it's you.

182
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:31,352
It opens...

183
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,397
every door.

184
00:16:34,478 --> 00:16:36,252
It opens every...

185
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:38,490
door.

186
00:16:38,491 --> 00:16:39,918
What are you talking about?

187
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:40,890
It opens...

188
00:16:41,237 --> 00:16:41,662
every...

189
00:16:42,163 --> 00:16:42,877
door.

190
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,366
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

191
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:14,517
You want to sleep
at our place tonight?

192
00:17:16,225 --> 00:17:17,324
No. We're all right.

193
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,511
We're good.

194
00:17:20,787 --> 00:17:23,413
Hey, listen, there's something 
I want to talk to you about.

195
00:17:24,606 --> 00:17:25,629
Hey, sweetie.

196
00:17:26,748 --> 00:17:28,580
No, they're gonna stay here tonight.

197
00:18:42,963 --> 00:18:44,178
My God.

198
00:20:49,893 --> 00:20:50,568
Hi.

199
00:20:58,517 --> 00:20:59,694
Take me home.

200
00:21:09,379 --> 00:21:10,247
Dad?

201
00:21:12,234 --> 00:21:13,314
What's in there?

202
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:16,845
It's just a dream, sweetheart.

203
00:21:29,192 --> 00:21:30,002
You see?

204
00:21:38,933 --> 00:21:39,744
Back to bed.

205
00:21:47,847 --> 00:21:50,412
1968, burn victim.

206
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,322
Unsolved.

207
00:21:55,505 --> 00:21:57,492
He swallowed a motel key?

208
00:22:04,438 --> 00:22:06,020
Pawn shop victim.

209
00:22:07,043 --> 00:22:08,779
The entry wounds are the same.

210
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,415
- I'm sorry.
- It's me.

211
00:22:21,724 --> 00:22:23,094
Are you coming to bed, Martin?

212
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,733
Yeah, actually, sweetie.

213
00:22:32,562 --> 00:22:34,183
Can you make animal pancakes?

214
00:22:35,957 --> 00:22:37,829
Can I make animal pancakes?

215
00:22:38,388 --> 00:22:40,086
What kind of animal
pancakes you want?

216
00:22:40,453 --> 00:22:41,282
Elephant.

217
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:45,038
I don't know how to make
an elephant, but how 'bout a mouse?

218
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,158
Elephant.

219
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:47,898
All right,

220
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,082
one elephant pancake coming up.

221
00:23:03,053 --> 00:23:03,670
Yeah.

222
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,252
Hey, Lou.

223
00:23:07,065 --> 00:23:10,181
She's a little spooked, but she seems
like she's doing all right.

224
00:23:10,944 --> 00:23:12,680
We have another court date tomorrow.

225
00:23:13,838 --> 00:23:15,719
But right now I'm making
elephant pancakes.

226
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,915
Everything's pretty normal.

227
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:18,468
Hey, Anna, check this out.

228
00:23:23,677 --> 00:23:25,973
Stuff keeps disappearing in the room.

229
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:27,767
What room?

230
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,214
The magic room.

231
00:23:36,844 --> 00:23:37,442
Okay.

232
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,105
Pick one.

233
00:23:41,301 --> 00:23:43,423
You know, I don't think
we should be doing this.

234
00:23:45,044 --> 00:23:46,934
Just pick... pick a stuffed animal.

235
00:23:48,735 --> 00:23:49,256
All right.

236
00:23:49,912 --> 00:23:51,880
Not Lester Bony fish.

237
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:52,671
Okay.

238
00:23:53,346 --> 00:23:54,735
Okay, this one.

239
00:23:54,913 --> 00:23:55,781
This one?

240
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,324
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

241
00:24:00,767 --> 00:24:01,790
Now watch.

242
00:24:21,255 --> 00:24:23,223
Hey, Anna, Anna, get back here.

243
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:26,831
Anna, what are you doing?
Come on, get out of there.

244
00:24:29,329 --> 00:24:30,159
Okay.

245
00:24:30,274 --> 00:24:31,953
Experiment over, okay?

246
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,458
That's it.

247
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:34,572
Open it.

248
00:24:51,097 --> 00:24:52,776
Come on, that's it, okay?
Game over.

249
00:24:53,162 --> 00:24:53,663
Okay?

250
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:54,875
Oh, Dad.

251
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,322
Listen. Listen to me.

252
00:24:56,341 --> 00:24:58,618
I need you to make me a promise.
All right?

253
00:24:59,428 --> 00:25:02,148
Not to tell anyone about
the room, or the key...

254
00:25:02,857 --> 00:25:04,864
- Or anything else, all right?
- Okay.

255
00:25:06,947 --> 00:25:07,680
Promise me.

256
00:25:08,182 --> 00:25:09,127
I promise.

257
00:25:20,191 --> 00:25:22,603
- Duuh! Jeez, Joe!
- Good morning.

258
00:25:22,835 --> 00:25:24,340
You scared the hell
out of me.

259
00:25:25,189 --> 00:25:26,269
How'd you, uh--

260
00:25:26,462 --> 00:25:27,851
I know how Ignacio did it.

261
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,263
Get dressed.

262
00:25:38,587 --> 00:25:40,574
What if it resets
while we're in there?

263
00:25:42,214 --> 00:25:44,587
I think as long as
we have the key, we're safe.

264
00:26:51,398 --> 00:26:53,115
We got water and electricity.

265
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,475
We can go anywhere?

266
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,385
Anywhere with a door, I think.

267
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:02,452
Penn state's playing.

268
00:27:14,586 --> 00:27:16,034
According to the money transfert,

269
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:18,639
someone tried to buy this key
for two million bucks.

270
00:27:18,967 --> 00:27:20,047
I'd pay three.

271
00:27:23,366 --> 00:27:26,259
Well, we can't keep it.
Three people are dead because of it.

272
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,089
I know.

273
00:27:29,288 --> 00:27:30,793
But let's enjoy it now.

274
00:27:31,256 --> 00:27:32,645
While we can. Okay?

275
00:27:33,262 --> 00:27:35,712
Who knows if we're gonna get
another chance like this.

276
00:27:35,886 --> 00:27:36,503
Yeah.

277
00:27:38,862 --> 00:27:40,058
Hey, Bridgewater.

278
00:27:42,644 --> 00:27:44,766
Direct from Cuba,
but you didn't get it from me.

279
00:27:44,767 --> 00:27:46,792
Keep it. I don't smoke
those stinky things.

280
00:27:46,808 --> 00:27:48,718
Me neither.
I just like giving them away.

281
00:27:49,297 --> 00:27:51,573
You got a visitor.
Jennifer Llosa.

282
00:27:51,978 --> 00:27:53,406
Iggy's sister.

283
00:27:58,904 --> 00:28:00,226
I'm sorry about your brother.

284
00:28:00,371 --> 00:28:01,181
Half brother.

285
00:28:03,052 --> 00:28:03,670
Thanks.

286
00:28:06,178 --> 00:28:07,547
Were you and Ignacio close?

287
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:09,322
I left home... early.

288
00:28:09,727 --> 00:28:10,595
I always thought

289
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:14,319
we'd be closer when he got older,
but... I guess not.

290
00:28:19,933 --> 00:28:23,048
My mother asked me to come down
for any outstanding paperwork.

291
00:28:24,428 --> 00:28:26,300
I'm pretty sure
it's all taken care of.

292
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,132
Unless you want
to sign for his

293
00:28:29,502 --> 00:28:30,640
personal effects.

294
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,338
So, Jennifer Llosa.

295
00:28:43,547 --> 00:28:44,492
Something wrong?

296
00:28:45,823 --> 00:28:47,405
Iggy didn't have
a sister.

297
00:28:48,756 --> 00:28:50,762
You took it, didn't you?

298
00:28:55,412 --> 00:28:56,454
Tell me what it is.

299
00:28:56,531 --> 00:28:57,920
I'm responsible for that key.

300
00:28:58,595 --> 00:29:00,254
- Give it to me.
- Who are you?

301
00:29:02,454 --> 00:29:04,171
- Let me go.
- Not until you tell me.

302
00:29:07,856 --> 00:29:08,782
Let me show you.

303
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:17,749
<i>Hey, Joe!</i>

304
00:29:18,829 --> 00:29:19,312
Joe!

305
00:29:28,109 --> 00:29:28,784
You okay?

306
00:29:30,077 --> 00:29:30,772
What's wrong?

307
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,672
She knows.

308
00:29:36,713 --> 00:29:37,331
Who?

309
00:29:49,176 --> 00:29:50,450
Miller has the key.

310
00:29:54,269 --> 00:29:55,350
Do I have to get a shot?

311
00:29:55,351 --> 00:29:57,298
No, I told you,
it's not that kind of a doctor.

312
00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:00,739
They just want to ask you some questions
about what it's like to live here and stuff.

313
00:30:00,975 --> 00:30:02,192
Do I have to go?

314
00:30:06,866 --> 00:30:07,273
Yeah.

315
00:30:07,595 --> 00:30:07,995
You do.

316
00:30:08,864 --> 00:30:10,292
These people just want to help us,

317
00:30:10,293 --> 00:30:12,588
and make sure that we're doing good.
And we are, right?

318
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:15,750
Yeah, except for you not
letting me stay up late.

319
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:18,741
Well, you make sure
and tell Dr. Gellman that.

320
00:30:19,223 --> 00:30:19,729
Okay.

321
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:20,570
All right.

322
00:30:25,305 --> 00:30:26,405
Anna Miller?

323
00:30:30,302 --> 00:30:30,881
You ready?

324
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:32,559
Yeah.

325
00:30:35,878 --> 00:30:38,637
<i>Paging Dr. Steadman,
Dr. Steadman, please.</i>

326
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:42,168
Okay.

327
00:30:42,612 --> 00:30:43,827
Have fun.
Tell the truth.

328
00:30:44,503 --> 00:30:45,872
Okay, I will.

329
00:30:56,695 --> 00:30:58,894
Do you know how long
this is gonna be? We have a

330
00:30:58,933 --> 00:31:01,904
- court thing at 17h.
- It'll be a couple of hours.

331
00:31:01,981 --> 00:31:04,335
If you'd like, there's a coffee shop
across the street

332
00:31:04,336 --> 00:31:05,801
- from the hospital.
- Thank you.

333
00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:16,585
I'm through eating this mush.
I'm getting some real food.

334
00:31:16,586 --> 00:31:19,229
- Mr. Jabrowski,get back in bed.
- Get your hands off me!

335
00:31:20,426 --> 00:31:24,256
For your crimes against decency,
and politeness, and common courtesy,

336
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:26,740
I condemn you to Hell!

337
00:31:35,258 --> 00:31:35,856
Hey!

338
00:31:38,346 --> 00:31:39,175
Hey.

339
00:31:57,277 --> 00:31:57,837
Hey.

340
00:32:03,065 --> 00:32:04,280
Where am I, man?

341
00:32:15,162 --> 00:32:16,281
I don't know.

342
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:20,371
Oh, man.

343
00:32:50,815 --> 00:32:51,645
Hospital.

344
00:33:00,356 --> 00:33:01,244
Wait, don't...

345
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,185
do that.

346
00:34:02,864 --> 00:34:04,967
Why won't you stay gone?!

347
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,616
So you're the new
motel guy?

348
00:34:21,654 --> 00:34:23,642
- Tell me about the bus ticket.
- Why?

349
00:34:29,063 --> 00:34:30,220
You want it back or not?

350
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:33,538
- What's your name?
- Wally.

351
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,754
Wally,

352
00:34:35,872 --> 00:34:37,165
I'm detective Joe Miller.

353
00:34:38,554 --> 00:34:40,580
Cop?
Interesting angle.

354
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:45,286
What were you
in the hospital for?

355
00:34:46,695 --> 00:34:47,679
Hemorrhoids.

356
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:50,689
Laser surgery.
What's it to you, detective?

357
00:34:51,488 --> 00:34:53,418
My daughter's here for a
psyche evaluation,

358
00:34:53,419 --> 00:34:55,501
her mother's suing for custody
after three years,

359
00:34:55,502 --> 00:34:57,427
and she'll probably win,
thanks for asking.

360
00:34:57,543 --> 00:34:58,894
Oh, sorry.

361
00:34:59,858 --> 00:35:00,302
I mean,

362
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,096
sorry.

363
00:35:02,636 --> 00:35:04,305
You forget to be
human sometimes.

364
00:35:06,089 --> 00:35:07,575
<i>Can I get you anything else?</i>

365
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,022
Thank you.

366
00:35:15,118 --> 00:35:16,044
It's on me.

367
00:35:16,064 --> 00:35:18,958
Can I have a greek omelet?
Actually, two.

368
00:35:21,331 --> 00:35:23,511
I blew the last of my
money on the surgery.

369
00:35:28,643 --> 00:35:30,186
Put it... Put it away!

370
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,084
- What is it?
- Is this a joke?

371
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:35,077
No.

372
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:38,964
I don't know what it is.

373
00:35:41,434 --> 00:35:42,707
Nice talking to you.

374
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:43,977
Okay, okay.

375
00:35:48,183 --> 00:35:49,842
It's an object.

376
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:52,717
Yeah?

377
00:35:54,626 --> 00:35:56,054
One of many.

378
00:35:56,304 --> 00:35:57,635
Okay, where do they
come from?

379
00:35:57,828 --> 00:36:00,413
From the motel room.

380
00:36:00,549 --> 00:36:03,230
All the objects come
from the motel room,

381
00:36:03,231 --> 00:36:05,371
you've been there,
you used the key, right?

382
00:36:06,074 --> 00:36:08,158
You really don't know
what I'm talking about?

383
00:36:09,808 --> 00:36:10,946
Holy crap.

384
00:36:11,641 --> 00:36:14,938
It's amateur hour. This guy's got the key,
doesn't even know what it is.

385
00:36:16,831 --> 00:36:18,162
How many objects are there?

386
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:24,124
All right. All right.
All right.

387
00:36:26,168 --> 00:36:28,308
There's a lot of 'em.
About a hundred, at least.

388
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:29,650
Nobody really knows for sure.

389
00:36:30,142 --> 00:36:31,126
A hundred?

390
00:36:33,296 --> 00:36:34,743
- And do they all...
- They do...

391
00:36:34,975 --> 00:36:36,171
weird stuff.

392
00:36:36,673 --> 00:36:38,544
Some are useful, some aren't.

393
00:36:39,055 --> 00:36:42,035
Used to know a guy who had the pencil.
You know what the pencil does?

394
00:36:42,036 --> 00:36:43,039
Makes pennies.

395
00:36:43,193 --> 00:36:45,007
Tap it on the table,
penny falls out.

396
00:36:45,238 --> 00:36:45,856
That's it.

397
00:36:46,416 --> 00:36:49,387
Guy made 500 bucks a day
tapping the damn pencil noon to night.

398
00:36:50,564 --> 00:36:51,470
Six months of that,

399
00:36:51,606 --> 00:36:52,744
tapped his brains out.

400
00:36:53,757 --> 00:36:55,532
Then there's the umbrella.

401
00:36:55,667 --> 00:36:57,143
Makes people think
they know you.

402
00:36:57,152 --> 00:36:59,140
Particularly helpful
if you're shy.

403
00:36:59,236 --> 00:37:01,436
Last guy who had it
moved to Seattle,

404
00:37:01,513 --> 00:37:03,075
to be less conspicuous.

405
00:37:03,386 --> 00:37:04,872
But other objects...

406
00:37:05,007 --> 00:37:06,627
say the...

407
00:37:06,704 --> 00:37:08,267
key, for example,

408
00:37:08,749 --> 00:37:10,138
highly useful.

409
00:37:13,707 --> 00:37:14,864
What about the bus ticket?

410
00:37:15,269 --> 00:37:16,176
Not that useful.

411
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,937
Unless you want to get to a little spot
outside Gallup, New Mexico, in a jiffy,

412
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:21,037
which I don't.

413
00:37:21,297 --> 00:37:22,127
Why Gallup?

414
00:37:23,265 --> 00:37:24,037
Why not?

415
00:37:27,148 --> 00:37:28,730
What happened in that motel room?

416
00:37:31,778 --> 00:37:32,434
Wally.

417
00:37:38,859 --> 00:37:40,055
Something terrible.

418
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:41,888
Look...

419
00:37:43,528 --> 00:37:44,608
detective Miller,

420
00:37:45,689 --> 00:37:48,621
do you ever feel that there's
something wrong with the universe?

421
00:37:49,084 --> 00:37:49,818
Yeah, sure.

422
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,534
Well, you're right.

423
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,486
Things like this
shouldn't happen.

424
00:37:55,027 --> 00:37:56,995
But in that motel room,
they did.

425
00:37:58,094 --> 00:38:00,487
Nobody really knows what happened,

426
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:02,763
but everybody's got a theory.
Some people think that

427
00:38:03,207 --> 00:38:05,117
God died,

428
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,194
and that all these objects,
they're little pieces of his corpse.

429
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:10,393
Some people say that's crap.

430
00:38:10,683 --> 00:38:11,957
They think that

431
00:38:11,995 --> 00:38:14,812
some part of the universe
broke down, and it's just

432
00:38:14,947 --> 00:38:16,622
physics gone haywire.

433
00:38:16,623 --> 00:38:18,453
And other people think
that God is alive,

434
00:38:18,454 --> 00:38:19,807
and this is some kind of test.

435
00:38:19,808 --> 00:38:24,129
And they're all out trying
to collect all the objects like

436
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:26,826
pilgrims looking for relics
during the middle ages.

437
00:38:28,909 --> 00:38:30,163
And what do you think, Wally?

438
00:38:31,321 --> 00:38:32,884
Who gives two squirts?

439
00:38:34,157 --> 00:38:35,257
All that matters

440
00:38:35,801 --> 00:38:37,035
is the price.

441
00:38:37,305 --> 00:38:38,868
That's what nobody gets.

442
00:38:39,138 --> 00:38:41,222
There's always a price to pay

443
00:38:41,453 --> 00:38:43,132
for using the objects.

444
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,982
Whether you know it or not,

445
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:46,564
there's always

446
00:38:46,834 --> 00:38:47,644
a price.

447
00:38:50,866 --> 00:38:52,255
What price did you pay?

448
00:38:53,721 --> 00:38:55,939
I'm not the one
you should be worried about.

449
00:38:57,406 --> 00:38:57,831
See,

450
00:38:58,081 --> 00:39:00,261
objects attract one
another like magnets.

451
00:39:00,415 --> 00:39:02,403
You think we ran into
each other by accident?

452
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,714
Every time you use that key,
it's like alarms going off.

453
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:08,993
People are coming for you, Joe.

454
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:10,054
Bad people.

455
00:39:10,382 --> 00:39:11,964
They're crawling out
of the woodwork.

456
00:39:11,965 --> 00:39:14,896
They don't even know who you are,
but they're already looking for you.

457
00:39:14,897 --> 00:39:17,964
Probably emptying your underwear drawer
right now, looking for that thing.

458
00:39:17,965 --> 00:39:21,436
And I think you understand me when I say
that they won't mind killing you...

459
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:24,022
or killing your family
to get their hands on it.

460
00:39:26,201 --> 00:39:27,050
Anna.

461
00:39:37,565 --> 00:39:38,105
Hi.

462
00:39:38,607 --> 00:39:39,282
Anna Miller?

463
00:39:40,417 --> 00:39:42,452
Anna Miller,
is she still with the doctor?

464
00:39:42,548 --> 00:39:44,410
Where's the other receptionist?
Anna miller.

465
00:39:44,411 --> 00:39:46,397
I'm sorry, sir,
she already left.

466
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,445
Left? What do you mean she left?!

467
00:39:50,275 --> 00:39:51,471
With her father?

468
00:39:58,956 --> 00:39:59,554
Miller.

469
00:39:59,902 --> 00:40:02,371
<i>I think you have something
of mine, detective Miller.</i>

470
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:04,204
Who is this?

471
00:40:06,462 --> 00:40:07,908
I know I have
something of yours.

472
00:40:09,355 --> 00:40:10,339
Care to trade?

473
00:40:20,824 --> 00:40:22,116
Come on, come on, pick up.

474
00:40:23,409 --> 00:40:27,815
Lou, it's me. They got Anna. She's in
a rail station off of route. Call me.

475
00:41:19,132 --> 00:41:20,135
Lose the doors.

476
00:41:20,733 --> 00:41:21,350
Burn 'em.

477
00:42:24,446 --> 00:42:25,295
Daddy!

478
00:42:45,398 --> 00:42:46,363
Hey, Joe.

479
00:42:48,851 --> 00:42:50,337
Were my directions okay?

480
00:42:55,411 --> 00:42:58,227
- What does the gun do?
- It shoots bullets really fast.

481
00:43:02,355 --> 00:43:03,494
It's gonna be okay.

482
00:43:07,892 --> 00:43:09,436
Do you know what
the pen can do...

483
00:43:10,198 --> 00:43:11,423
detective Miller?

484
00:43:13,256 --> 00:43:14,780
It can cook your daughter

485
00:43:15,648 --> 00:43:16,671
like a microwave.

486
00:43:20,143 --> 00:43:20,760
Here...

487
00:43:24,253 --> 00:43:25,082
let me show you.

488
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:27,648
Stop.

489
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:38,915
Smart man, your father.

490
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:42,465
I'll give you the key.

491
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:45,976
You'll give me
my daughter back,

492
00:43:47,655 --> 00:43:49,420
and then you'll leave,
understand?

493
00:43:50,626 --> 00:43:51,397
Of course.

494
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:11,538
Grab him!

495
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:33,377
You killed my brother!

496
00:45:09,287 --> 00:45:10,203
Gimme that key!

497
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:16,717
Anna!

498
00:45:17,821 --> 00:45:18,680
Anna!

499
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:21,547
Daddy!

500
00:45:25,179 --> 00:45:26,354
Noooo!

501
00:45:34,837 --> 00:45:36,026
Reset it!

502
00:45:43,748 --> 00:45:44,937
I didn't mean to!

503
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:46,955
You can bring her back,
she's not dead!

504
00:45:47,336 --> 00:45:49,345
There's an object that
can bring her back.

505
00:45:49,892 --> 00:45:51,204
I can take you to it.

506
00:46:43,248 --> 00:46:44,205
God, Anna.

507
00:46:51,722 --> 00:46:53,458
You know what this looks like?

508
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,048
He's in the middle
of a custody battle.

509
00:46:56,252 --> 00:46:57,086
His ex said

510
00:46:57,087 --> 00:47:00,210
he missed their court appointment,
and now, he and Anna are gone.

511
00:47:00,247 --> 00:47:01,217
Joe wouldn't run.

512
00:47:01,737 --> 00:47:03,281
Then where did that
little girl go?

513
00:47:13,815 --> 00:47:15,557
We've got blood,
ladies and gentlemen

514
00:47:16,462 --> 00:47:17,515
Come on, Joe.

515
00:47:18,034 --> 00:47:18,963
Answer.

516
00:48:47,438 --> 00:48:49,379
- Destefano.
- Yeah, it's me.

517
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,577
Holy God, you're okay.

518
00:48:53,527 --> 00:48:54,785
<i>Anna with you?</i>

519
00:48:56,015 --> 00:48:57,231
No, she's gone.

520
00:49:01,181 --> 00:49:02,138
Where is she?

521
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,057
She went into the room.

522
00:49:07,956 --> 00:49:10,157
She went into the room,
and she's gone.

523
00:49:13,598 --> 00:49:15,798
Joe... you need to come home.

524
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:19,612
We'll figure this thing out.
They're already thinking the worst.

525
00:49:19,817 --> 00:49:21,224
<i>They found blood on the door.</i>

526
00:49:23,609 --> 00:49:25,659
What about the body?
There was a burned body.

527
00:49:25,731 --> 00:49:28,806
We didn't find a body. They just want
to know what happened to Anna.

528
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:32,428
Well, she's alive, Lou.

529
00:49:33,084 --> 00:49:35,271
Listen, I need you to do
a background check for me

530
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:37,020
on a guy that Iggy called the weasel.

531
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:42,477
Joe.

532
00:49:43,966 --> 00:49:44,773
I gotta go.

533
00:49:46,153 --> 00:49:46,837
Hello.

534
00:49:52,757 --> 00:49:53,905
Where'd you come from?

535
00:49:56,475 --> 00:49:57,281
What?

536
00:49:57,971 --> 00:49:59,420
Where were you
two minutes ago?

537
00:50:00,267 --> 00:50:01,018
Texas.

538
00:50:01,257 --> 00:50:04,237
Let this be a lesson
to you all, cowboy,

539
00:50:04,804 --> 00:50:08,705
that no man shall judge, tease,
or criticize another man.

540
00:50:08,883 --> 00:50:10,482
You can't be mean.

541
00:50:10,687 --> 00:50:12,755
You shouldn't be mean.
Being me--

542
00:50:15,063 --> 00:50:16,840
- Hi, Wally.
- Oh, hi.

543
00:50:21,037 --> 00:50:22,650
I suppose it's possible.

544
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,468
There's a chance.

545
00:50:25,766 --> 00:50:27,543
A very small chance

546
00:50:27,544 --> 00:50:29,757
you can bring the kid
back out of this room.

547
00:50:31,135 --> 00:50:32,502
Well, tell me how
I can do it.

548
00:50:35,021 --> 00:50:35,773
Well...

549
00:50:38,145 --> 00:50:39,303
Sometimes...

550
00:50:40,942 --> 00:50:44,145
When you start getting
objects together,

551
00:50:45,464 --> 00:50:47,406
weird things happen.

552
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:50,260
New things.

553
00:50:50,936 --> 00:50:52,344
New properties.

554
00:50:52,595 --> 00:50:54,196
Totally unpredictable.

555
00:50:55,402 --> 00:50:56,733
Take the watch.

556
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,141
Useless, right?

557
00:50:58,411 --> 00:50:59,955
- The watch?
- Wristwatch.

558
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:02,270
Cooks eggs.
Nothing else, just eggs.

559
00:51:02,483 --> 00:51:04,567
Put an egg in the middle,
hard-boils it.

560
00:51:04,586 --> 00:51:07,065
I don't know how somebody figured
that out, but they did.

561
00:51:07,219 --> 00:51:08,087
Anyway,

562
00:51:08,705 --> 00:51:12,061
nobody used to care much
about the watch until

563
00:51:12,467 --> 00:51:15,572
one day somebody found out
that if you put the watch

564
00:51:16,035 --> 00:51:19,199
and the knife together,

565
00:51:19,894 --> 00:51:20,974
you get a...

566
00:51:22,074 --> 00:51:23,926
kind of telepathy.

567
00:51:28,363 --> 00:51:30,659
So you're saying that
if I find the right object,

568
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:33,376
- and I use it with the key...
- I don't know, Joe...

569
00:51:33,717 --> 00:51:34,855
it's a million to one.

570
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:41,067
- I'll take it.
- Whatever you do,

571
00:51:41,337 --> 00:51:44,327
don't lose the key. If you lose it,
you'll never get her back.

572
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:13,208
Cop's kid vanished.

573
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:15,639
Him too.

574
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,334
It's not right.

575
00:52:24,957 --> 00:52:28,140
We need to find the key
before the weasel.

576
00:52:29,684 --> 00:52:30,514
Before.

577
00:52:39,832 --> 00:52:40,584
Lou.

578
00:52:45,601 --> 00:52:48,109
I got a sample of Anna's blood
from the hospital,

579
00:52:48,611 --> 00:52:51,273
and I ran it against what we found
in the storage room.

580
00:52:51,659 --> 00:52:52,720
It's a match.

581
00:52:55,421 --> 00:52:58,063
You think you could lose
that report for a little while?

582
00:52:58,141 --> 00:52:58,778
Lou...

583
00:53:00,707 --> 00:53:03,716
- 24 hours, tops.
- Thanks, Marty.

584
00:53:06,899 --> 00:53:08,694
Ignacio's personal effects?

585
00:53:09,967 --> 00:53:10,623
Yeah.

586
00:53:22,527 --> 00:53:23,048
What?

587
00:53:23,221 --> 00:53:23,955
<i>Dr. Ruber,</i>

588
00:53:24,244 --> 00:53:27,601
<i>I compiled all the death certificates
for the burn victims, like you asked.</i>

589
00:53:27,794 --> 00:53:28,353
Yeah.

590
00:53:28,546 --> 00:53:31,421
<i>- But I ran into trouble on one of them.
- What's the problem?</i>

591
00:53:31,517 --> 00:53:34,237
<i>The burn case from 93.
He's still alive.</i>

592
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:35,877
<i>His name is Milton Vrang.</i>

593
00:53:37,805 --> 00:53:39,947
- Is this a trick?
- No.

594
00:53:40,892 --> 00:53:41,857
Not at all.

595
00:53:42,474 --> 00:53:44,943
Whenever I talk about it,
they up my meds.

596
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:48,049
You're safe.

597
00:53:50,865 --> 00:53:52,100
You can tell me anything.

598
00:53:53,874 --> 00:53:55,746
I'll tell you what
I used to believe.

599
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:58,910
Not what I believe now,
because now...

600
00:53:59,218 --> 00:53:59,952
I'm healthy.

601
00:54:02,151 --> 00:54:03,386
What I used to believe is...

602
00:54:03,946 --> 00:54:05,045
is that there were

603
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,032
these things

604
00:54:07,399 --> 00:54:08,961
spread throughout the world

605
00:54:09,811 --> 00:54:10,910
that looked like

606
00:54:11,624 --> 00:54:13,071
ordinary things,

607
00:54:13,476 --> 00:54:14,402
but weren't.

608
00:54:14,981 --> 00:54:16,679
But if you could find

609
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:18,974
all these things,

610
00:54:19,534 --> 00:54:21,116
they would lead a path...

611
00:54:22,255 --> 00:54:24,628
and you could know
the mind of God.

612
00:54:28,448 --> 00:54:31,284
I used to believe
I belonged to a cabal,

613
00:54:31,632 --> 00:54:35,625
a group that was dedicated
to collecting all the objects

614
00:54:36,388 --> 00:54:38,278
for this holy purpose.

615
00:54:39,494 --> 00:54:41,983
But some of the objects...

616
00:54:43,817 --> 00:54:45,051
are full

617
00:54:45,727 --> 00:54:47,810
of holy... holy fire.

618
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,977
So, you see, when I was...

619
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:55,507
when I was touched with

620
00:54:57,301 --> 00:54:58,246
the pen...

621
00:55:00,716 --> 00:55:02,645
I burned. Burned!

622
00:55:05,038 --> 00:55:05,559
A pen?

623
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:07,643
A ballpoint pen?

624
00:55:08,125 --> 00:55:10,710
- Did they send you to kill me?
- Who?

625
00:55:11,404 --> 00:55:13,083
- The order.
- No.

626
00:55:14,607 --> 00:55:15,668
Mr. Vrang,

627
00:55:16,537 --> 00:55:22,094
I need you to tell me
everything you know. Please.

628
00:55:23,617 --> 00:55:24,582
Please.

629
00:55:26,492 --> 00:55:28,035
Tell me about the key.

630
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:38,857
What the hell.

631
00:57:08,836 --> 00:57:10,399
Took you long enough,
detective.

632
00:57:12,386 --> 00:57:13,890
Make sure you get
all of 'em.

633
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:15,878
One of these radios
is an object.

634
00:57:16,322 --> 00:57:17,923
I'm trying to figure out
which one.

635
00:57:20,209 --> 00:57:21,501
By smashing it?

636
00:57:24,183 --> 00:57:25,727
You can't break an object.

637
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:28,215
Haven't you learned
anything yet?

638
00:57:31,707 --> 00:57:33,038
Guess that's the one.

639
00:57:34,178 --> 00:57:37,731
Supposed to make you three inches taller,
if you tune it to the right station.

640
00:57:38,777 --> 00:57:39,722
Fascinating.

641
00:57:41,497 --> 00:57:42,751
So, who are you?

642
00:57:44,979 --> 00:57:46,108
Jennifer Bloom.

643
00:57:47,719 --> 00:57:50,825
One of the dead men in the pawn shop,
Marco Cordova,

644
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:52,253
I knew him.

645
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:53,951
He was my second.

646
00:57:55,436 --> 00:57:56,343
My partner.

647
00:57:56,671 --> 00:57:59,970
Former partner.
Went rogue about six months ago.

648
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:02,728
He took the key.

649
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,101
Joe,

650
00:58:06,085 --> 00:58:08,864
if I wanted, I could have killed you
the moment you walked in here.

651
00:58:09,134 --> 00:58:10,021
But I didn't.

652
00:58:12,414 --> 00:58:13,861
That's not what
we're about.

653
00:58:14,633 --> 00:58:16,427
Rule number one,
we don't kill.

654
00:58:17,372 --> 00:58:18,298
Ever.

655
00:58:20,738 --> 00:58:21,799
And who's "we"?

656
00:58:24,095 --> 00:58:25,214
We're called the legion.

657
00:58:26,564 --> 00:58:28,860
We're trying to get rid
of the objects.

658
00:58:28,937 --> 00:58:30,828
For good.
All of them.

659
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:33,433
We track the owners,

660
00:58:33,761 --> 00:58:34,803
make contact,

661
00:58:34,996 --> 00:58:36,539
ask them to give us
their objects,

662
00:58:36,771 --> 00:58:37,813
join our cause.

663
00:58:38,623 --> 00:58:39,587
That ever work?

664
00:58:41,494 --> 00:58:43,034
I've had people beg me.

665
00:58:44,582 --> 00:58:45,264
Tell me,

666
00:58:46,987 --> 00:58:48,012
since you found the key,

667
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:50,120
has your life gotten better,

668
00:58:51,019 --> 00:58:51,740
or worse?

669
00:58:55,948 --> 00:58:57,429
My daughter went
into the room.

670
00:59:00,825 --> 00:59:02,399
And I need the key
to bring her back.

671
00:59:04,221 --> 00:59:05,780
The legion can help you.

672
00:59:07,238 --> 00:59:08,048
Let us.

673
00:59:08,531 --> 00:59:09,724
How are you gonna help me?

674
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:10,884
Join,

675
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:13,013
and I'll tell you everything.

676
00:59:15,111 --> 00:59:15,728
Right.

677
00:59:16,191 --> 00:59:16,886
Joe,

678
00:59:17,581 --> 00:59:18,121
wait.

679
00:59:21,053 --> 00:59:21,671
Leave it.

680
00:59:38,842 --> 00:59:40,482
I think I'll skip nap time today.

681
00:59:50,863 --> 00:59:52,175
We need you, Joe.

682
00:59:52,854 --> 00:59:54,089
And you need us.

683
00:59:57,249 --> 00:59:58,769
I'm a friend
of Milton Vrang's,

684
00:59:58,770 --> 01:00:01,393
and I'm calling
about the order of

685
01:00:02,126 --> 01:00:03,380
the reunification.

686
01:00:03,998 --> 01:00:05,175
<i>I didn't order anything.</i>

687
01:00:17,753 --> 01:00:20,116
<i>The number you have dialed
has been disconnect...</i>

688
01:00:29,242 --> 01:00:30,612
- Hello?
- Hello.

689
01:00:30,882 --> 01:00:32,850
I'm a friend
of Milton vrang's.

690
01:00:33,082 --> 01:00:36,477
I'm calling about the order
of the reunification.

691
01:00:36,949 --> 01:00:37,547
<i>The order?</i>

692
01:00:39,746 --> 01:00:40,402
Yes.

693
01:00:40,768 --> 01:00:41,772
The new religion.

694
01:00:48,523 --> 01:00:49,217
Is that him?

695
01:00:54,986 --> 01:00:56,047
Yeah, that's him.

696
01:00:57,899 --> 01:01:00,194
I shouldn't even be here.
It'll just make you a target.

697
01:01:00,368 --> 01:01:01,236
Enough with that.

698
01:01:01,429 --> 01:01:03,166
We're in this thing
together all the way.

699
01:01:03,185 --> 01:01:05,133
All right? Whatever
the hell this thing is.

700
01:01:05,336 --> 01:01:06,069
Partners.

701
01:01:11,046 --> 01:01:12,146
What's his name?

702
01:01:15,812 --> 01:01:17,027
Howard Montague.

703
01:01:18,724 --> 01:01:19,438
The weasel.

704
01:01:20,364 --> 01:01:21,502
Howard Montague.

705
01:01:21,846 --> 01:01:24,103
We'll open an investigation,
make it official.

706
01:01:24,238 --> 01:01:25,704
Come on,
what would we even say?

707
01:01:25,859 --> 01:01:28,010
We don't say anything,
we just show 'em the key.

708
01:01:31,318 --> 01:01:32,534
I can't risk losing it.

709
01:01:33,691 --> 01:01:35,736
The key's my only shot
at bringing Anna back.

710
01:01:36,084 --> 01:01:38,533
Well, at least make a statement,
and clear your name.

711
01:01:39,248 --> 01:01:40,695
We'll look for Anna
together.

712
01:01:41,402 --> 01:01:42,463
Let me help you.

713
01:01:43,176 --> 01:01:44,160
Yeah, sure, Lou.

714
01:01:45,684 --> 01:01:46,475
All right.

715
01:01:48,695 --> 01:01:50,384
Now, we gotta talk
to Lee.

716
01:01:51,104 --> 01:01:51,931
She's smart.

717
01:01:53,225 --> 01:01:54,391
She won't flip out.

718
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:58,229
At least I don't think she will.
Do you?

719
01:02:51,261 --> 01:02:53,899
Now, you know killing me won't
bring your little Anna back.

720
01:02:54,008 --> 01:02:55,796
Then you better tell me
what will.

721
01:02:55,914 --> 01:02:58,108
May I remind you you're
an officer of the law?

722
01:02:58,414 --> 01:02:59,362
Say that again.

723
01:02:59,698 --> 01:03:01,061
Say that again!

724
01:03:05,526 --> 01:03:06,514
If you lie to me,

725
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:08,470
you're dead.
Understand?

726
01:03:10,983 --> 01:03:13,202
Is there an object
that can bring her back?

727
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:15,344
In concert with the key,

728
01:03:15,846 --> 01:03:17,003
- yes.
- What is it?

729
01:03:17,582 --> 01:03:20,321
- Tell me!
- Not unless you let me go.

730
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:25,259
No deals.

731
01:03:25,472 --> 01:03:29,079
Listen, you ever want to see your kid
again, you will deal with me.

732
01:03:29,696 --> 01:03:32,668
I get you the object,
you give me the key. That's the deal.

733
01:03:34,867 --> 01:03:37,355
When I get my daughter back,
I'll give you the key.

734
01:03:39,343 --> 01:03:40,597
When she's safe.

735
01:03:42,487 --> 01:03:43,028
Deal.

736
01:03:52,423 --> 01:03:53,465
Give me the pen.

737
01:03:55,645 --> 01:03:56,552
It's mine.

738
01:03:56,989 --> 01:04:00,134
I don't want you sticking it in my ribs
the next time I turn around.

739
01:04:00,829 --> 01:04:02,063
Now, reach into
your pocket.

740
01:04:05,518 --> 01:04:06,116
Drop it.

741
01:04:14,566 --> 01:04:15,396
What else you got?

742
01:04:34,283 --> 01:04:35,517
Underpants too,
Montague.

743
01:04:35,614 --> 01:04:38,276
This is idiotic.
My underwear is not an object.

744
01:04:38,372 --> 01:04:40,379
Well, then, I'm sure
you wont' miss 'em.

745
01:05:00,887 --> 01:05:02,411
I hope you're proud
of yourself.

746
01:05:18,172 --> 01:05:20,313
Are any of those things
the object I'm looking for?

747
01:05:20,332 --> 01:05:20,680
No.

748
01:05:21,471 --> 01:05:22,377
Don't be stupid.

749
01:05:23,709 --> 01:05:24,133
Good.

750
01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:27,991
That's-- that's my--

751
01:05:40,995 --> 01:05:41,573
The pen.

752
01:05:42,384 --> 01:05:43,329
It's still there.

753
01:05:47,654 --> 01:05:48,638
And it moved.

754
01:05:51,387 --> 01:05:53,065
The object survived
the reset.

755
01:05:55,689 --> 01:05:57,483
Maybe that's where
it's supposed to go.

756
01:06:22,133 --> 01:06:23,329
You really read
this stuff?

757
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:25,220
I used to teach it
before I was

758
01:06:25,221 --> 01:06:27,322
unjustly terminated.
Come here, look.

759
01:06:27,843 --> 01:06:28,730
My masterpiece.

760
01:06:29,868 --> 01:06:31,508
It's a map of
all of the objects.

761
01:06:31,547 --> 01:06:32,974
Their relationship
to one another.

762
01:06:33,495 --> 01:06:34,055
You see...

763
01:06:35,859 --> 01:06:37,036
over here's the key.

764
01:06:37,865 --> 01:06:39,968
Pivotal object,
very powerful.

765
01:06:49,055 --> 01:06:49,923
What's this?

766
01:06:51,756 --> 01:06:53,010
The prime object.

767
01:06:53,588 --> 01:06:55,094
The one that connects
everything.

768
01:06:55,923 --> 01:06:59,045
They say that the prime object
controls all of the other objects.

769
01:07:00,728 --> 01:07:02,330
And it will bring
my daughter back.

770
01:07:03,178 --> 01:07:04,721
If you use it
with the key.

771
01:07:05,222 --> 01:07:06,206
Yes.

772
01:07:09,659 --> 01:07:10,470
What is it?

773
01:07:18,515 --> 01:07:19,480
The clock.

774
01:07:25,479 --> 01:07:27,269
You're sure Kreutzfeld
has the clock?

775
01:07:27,949 --> 01:07:28,836
Oh, yeah.

776
01:07:30,322 --> 01:07:31,904
He's an object collector.

777
01:07:33,537 --> 01:07:36,007
He uses the pawn shops
to comb for objects.

778
01:07:36,644 --> 01:07:39,659
Keeps everything up on the third floor,
but security is tight.

779
01:07:40,753 --> 01:07:42,605
Why does he need
so much protection?

780
01:07:44,612 --> 01:07:47,409
Maybe he's afraid someone's
gonna try to steal the clock.

781
01:08:06,189 --> 01:08:09,411
Corner of Smithfield and Liberty
4:30 PM. Thursday.

782
01:08:18,610 --> 01:08:20,231
Thank you. Just keep
the change.

783
01:08:27,138 --> 01:08:29,068
<i>Did you see that
blue car go by?</i>

784
01:08:30,534 --> 01:08:31,518
<i>Was it pretty?</i>

785
01:08:32,772 --> 01:08:35,203
Stop making phone calls
if you want to live.

786
01:08:36,414 --> 01:08:38,483
- I have questions.
- Bring us an object.

787
01:08:38,729 --> 01:08:39,906
You'll get answers.

788
01:08:46,927 --> 01:08:50,260
Kreutzfeld converted this place
to be the most anti-key house

789
01:08:50,261 --> 01:08:53,225
you could ever think of.
See, he pulled a permit in '96.

790
01:08:54,634 --> 01:08:57,301
The front door is a sliding door,
no pintumbler lock.

791
01:08:57,302 --> 01:08:59,918
- The key won't work.
- Every door in this house slides.

792
01:08:59,919 --> 01:09:01,058
Even the closets.

793
01:09:01,276 --> 01:09:02,858
Can't get inside
with the key.

794
01:09:02,896 --> 01:09:03,880
This area here,

795
01:09:04,169 --> 01:09:06,099
it's bulletproof glass,
three layers thick.

796
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:08,559
You see these doors?
They all have electronic locks.

797
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,229
You need a pass card
to get through 'em.

798
01:09:10,235 --> 01:09:13,663
- So, once the alarm system is triggered...
- You're sealed in. Sitting ducks.

799
01:09:13,673 --> 01:09:16,370
You realize now why
I've never attempted this.

800
01:09:16,508 --> 01:09:19,343
Let's check the original plans
against these revised plans.

801
01:09:29,122 --> 01:09:30,515
Where did this door go?

802
01:09:31,284 --> 01:09:34,229
There were two doors going into
this room, and now there's only one.

803
01:09:38,219 --> 01:09:39,276
There's a wall.

804
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:43,643
He got rid of it,
I guess.

805
01:09:43,988 --> 01:09:45,430
Made it more secure
that way.

806
01:09:46,279 --> 01:09:47,455
I know how
we're getting in.

807
01:09:49,773 --> 01:09:52,374
There are lots of guards.
You're gonna have to shoot 'em all.

808
01:09:52,375 --> 01:09:53,985
How many bullets
do you have?

809
01:09:54,637 --> 01:09:56,583
If I shoot anybody,
it's gonna be you.

810
01:09:58,756 --> 01:10:00,232
That's not
very collaborative.

811
01:10:03,257 --> 01:10:05,605
What's the most powerful
object you can think of?

812
01:10:05,783 --> 01:10:06,573
The key.

813
01:10:07,847 --> 01:10:09,637
No, I mean dangerous,
like a weapon.

814
01:10:11,038 --> 01:10:11,838
The eye.

815
01:10:13,063 --> 01:10:14,406
The glass eye.

816
01:10:14,499 --> 01:10:16,698
Nobody's seen it in years.
You'll never find it.

817
01:10:18,004 --> 01:10:19,170
What does the eye do?

818
01:10:21,367 --> 01:10:22,158
Well,

819
01:10:23,836 --> 01:10:24,974
to tell you the truth...

820
01:10:25,386 --> 01:10:26,524
- Shut up.
- All right.

821
01:10:29,379 --> 01:10:30,788
Get a message
to your boss.

822
01:10:31,714 --> 01:10:33,662
Tell Kreutzfeld
I have a present for him.

823
01:10:33,971 --> 01:10:34,685
The weasel.

824
01:10:35,305 --> 01:10:36,482
I want to make a trade.

825
01:10:36,483 --> 01:10:39,260
Meet me out front, and don't try
anything funny. I have the eye.

826
01:10:39,338 --> 01:10:40,322
You son of a...

827
01:10:40,804 --> 01:10:41,585
Will you shut up?

828
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:43,476
I'm not gonna give you
over to Kreutzfeld.

829
01:10:44,945 --> 01:10:46,530
I'm just trying to clear the house.

830
01:10:46,531 --> 01:10:48,210
How are we supposed
to get in there now?

831
01:10:48,211 --> 01:10:49,087
With the key.

832
01:10:49,561 --> 01:10:51,584
There are no viable doors
in that house.

833
01:10:52,877 --> 01:10:53,445
There's one.

834
01:11:08,403 --> 01:11:09,428
Close the door.

835
01:11:10,785 --> 01:11:11,896
It's our only way out.

836
01:11:12,353 --> 01:11:15,156
We're never gonna make it
back downstairs. Now close it.

837
01:11:22,009 --> 01:11:24,262
<i>I want the entire
building secured.</i>

838
01:11:48,559 --> 01:11:50,353
Protect the upstairs.

839
01:12:04,996 --> 01:12:06,655
Back to bed, kiddo.

840
01:12:09,655 --> 01:12:10,446
Okay?

841
01:12:36,528 --> 01:12:37,261
Easy.

842
01:12:38,303 --> 01:12:39,499
Hands out to your sides.

843
01:12:41,930 --> 01:12:43,184
Get his access card.

844
01:12:55,721 --> 01:12:57,206
What's the code?

845
01:12:59,965 --> 01:13:01,470
What's the code?

846
01:13:25,142 --> 01:13:25,798
Stay.

847
01:13:50,937 --> 01:13:53,194
Anthony, have you
secured upstairs?

848
01:13:55,894 --> 01:13:56,898
Anthony?

849
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,235
They're upstairs.

850
01:14:18,465 --> 01:14:19,797
Dormant objects.

851
01:14:20,067 --> 01:14:22,320
Their properties haven't
been discovered yet.

852
01:14:25,276 --> 01:14:26,433
Where's the clock?

853
01:14:36,824 --> 01:14:39,525
Well, you didn't think he'd leave
it out in the open, did you?

854
01:14:40,624 --> 01:14:42,129
Hand me the ax.

855
01:14:42,302 --> 01:14:42,707
But...

856
01:14:43,517 --> 01:14:44,482
you gotta be kidding.

857
01:14:45,466 --> 01:14:47,858
You can't expect
to open a safe with an ax.

858
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:08,858
The door...

859
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:10,633
It's still here?

860
01:15:12,244 --> 01:15:14,424
- Sometimes they build over 'em.
- Sometimes?

861
01:15:29,367 --> 01:15:31,258
- Open it.
- I can't!

862
01:15:34,151 --> 01:15:35,193
Break it down.

863
01:15:35,309 --> 01:15:37,663
- It's bulletproof.
- Break it down!

864
01:15:44,859 --> 01:15:46,306
Look out, look out!

865
01:15:53,232 --> 01:15:54,254
Hurry up.

866
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:56,570
Joe...

867
01:15:57,614 --> 01:15:58,791
we got a problem.

868
01:16:00,451 --> 01:16:01,319
There's no knob,

869
01:16:01,434 --> 01:16:03,614
there's no lock.
We can't use the key.

870
01:16:08,844 --> 01:16:09,577
come on!

871
01:16:14,747 --> 01:16:17,081
- What the hell are you doing?
- Check the bag.

872
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:19,576
A door knob?

873
01:16:23,648 --> 01:16:25,075
This is your plan, huh?

874
01:16:25,345 --> 01:16:26,387
You're remodeling.

875
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:28,027
Plug it in.

876
01:16:30,866 --> 01:16:32,409
Couldn't get
cordless, huh?

877
01:16:33,354 --> 01:16:35,342
- Shut up and plug it in.
- All right.

878
01:16:36,094 --> 01:16:37,788
Kill the power
in the study.

879
01:16:57,910 --> 01:16:59,280
Gimme that light
over here.

880
01:16:59,887 --> 01:17:00,987
Is that knob
gonna work?

881
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:02,492
I mean, does
that count?

882
01:17:06,022 --> 01:17:07,450
Now the next one!

883
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:10,189
Hurry it up.

884
01:17:11,366 --> 01:17:12,118
Come on!

885
01:17:14,646 --> 01:17:16,343
- Light. I need light.
- Right!

886
01:17:18,098 --> 01:17:19,892
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

887
01:17:28,766 --> 01:17:30,271
Come on.

888
01:17:36,117 --> 01:17:37,583
Oh, my God.

889
01:17:41,096 --> 01:17:42,735
Not without the clock.

890
01:17:44,336 --> 01:17:45,263
Come on!

891
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:48,156
- Hurry up!
- Don't stop! Come on!

892
01:17:51,370 --> 01:17:52,566
Detective Miller,

893
01:17:53,357 --> 01:17:57,042
there are events in motion that are far
greater than you could understand.

894
01:17:57,043 --> 01:17:58,026
I will help you.

895
01:17:58,477 --> 01:18:01,892
I will get you anything you want,
but I must have that key.

896
01:18:04,265 --> 01:18:05,499
<i>Now get in there!</i>

897
01:18:11,399 --> 01:18:12,268
Get 'em!

898
01:18:23,572 --> 01:18:24,479
Look out.

899
01:18:43,983 --> 01:18:45,855
I used to know
a safecracker.

900
01:18:46,029 --> 01:18:47,881
It's possible
I could look him...

901
01:18:58,874 --> 01:18:59,896
There it is.

902
01:19:17,201 --> 01:19:18,359
There it is.

903
01:19:20,674 --> 01:19:21,908
Now what do I do?

904
01:19:24,011 --> 01:19:26,114
To bring my daughter back,
what do I do?

905
01:19:26,770 --> 01:19:27,870
Open it?

906
01:19:33,773 --> 01:19:36,223
You better know what the hell
you're talking about.

907
01:19:55,978 --> 01:19:57,560
Please,
bring my daughter back.

908
01:20:03,308 --> 01:20:05,411
Please,
bring my daughter back.

909
01:20:10,601 --> 01:20:12,029
This can't be.
It's impossible.

910
01:20:12,048 --> 01:20:14,865
It's a prime object!
It's the clock! It has to be.

911
01:20:15,193 --> 01:20:16,601
I'm right.
I'm always right.

912
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:17,855
Look, we had a deal.

913
01:20:18,469 --> 01:20:21,672
- I get you that clock, you give me the key.
- When my daughter is safe.

914
01:20:29,485 --> 01:20:32,051
It doesn't work
in the room.

915
01:20:44,273 --> 01:20:44,949
Hello.

916
01:20:49,530 --> 01:20:51,634
We'll bring you in,
we'll show 'em the key.

917
01:20:51,673 --> 01:20:53,259
We'll blow the whole thing wide open.

918
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:55,259
There won't be a case
against you after this.

919
01:20:56,255 --> 01:20:57,539
And then we'll
get Anna back.

920
01:20:57,717 --> 01:20:59,406
Whatever it takes,
I promise.

921
01:21:04,404 --> 01:21:05,105
Destefano.

922
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:07,733
Hi, Lou, it's Martin.

923
01:21:08,089 --> 01:21:08,582
<i>Ruby!</i>

924
01:21:09,006 --> 01:21:10,863
What sweet wind blows
in my direction?

925
01:21:12,314 --> 01:21:15,478
I need to see you and Joe Miller.
It's important.

926
01:21:17,157 --> 01:21:18,662
It's about the key.

927
01:21:20,533 --> 01:21:23,273
This isn't just a random
collection of things.

928
01:21:23,274 --> 01:21:24,990
There is something
going on.

929
01:21:27,112 --> 01:21:29,832
Some people think
that these things are...

930
01:21:29,833 --> 01:21:31,993
a way to communicate
with God.

931
01:21:33,324 --> 01:21:36,160
Some say the objects
are God.

932
01:21:37,549 --> 01:21:38,302
Come on.

933
01:21:38,475 --> 01:21:40,115
I'm not saying
I believe that.

934
01:21:40,231 --> 01:21:42,469
I don't know what I believe.
It's just...

935
01:21:47,524 --> 01:21:48,971
Can I see the key?

936
01:21:50,129 --> 01:21:50,920
Please?

937
01:21:52,367 --> 01:21:55,300
I just have to know
if it's real.

938
01:22:21,959 --> 01:22:23,078
I've been waiting

939
01:22:23,503 --> 01:22:24,892
all my life...

940
01:22:25,606 --> 01:22:26,818
for something,

941
01:22:27,917 --> 01:22:29,094
it's this.

942
01:22:30,290 --> 01:22:31,544
We can't tell anyone.

943
01:22:31,756 --> 01:22:33,319
Rube, we gotta clear Joe.

944
01:22:33,590 --> 01:22:36,349
They'll put him away for kidnapping.
Or worse, murder.

945
01:22:37,101 --> 01:22:38,529
We have to show them
the key.

946
01:22:38,664 --> 01:22:40,690
I've gotta save
my daughter, Ruber.

947
01:22:40,728 --> 01:22:42,619
And Lou's right,
I can't do it alone.

948
01:22:43,710 --> 01:22:46,372
- I don't have any other choice.
- Your daughter

949
01:22:46,468 --> 01:22:49,787
is gone, and I'm
so sorry for you.

950
01:22:50,192 --> 01:22:51,716
But you can't
bring her back.

951
01:22:53,068 --> 01:22:56,252
We have to keep
the key to ourselves.

952
01:22:57,139 --> 01:22:59,396
We have to use this.

953
01:23:01,026 --> 01:23:02,194
I've made my decision.

954
01:23:18,509 --> 01:23:19,030
Marty!

955
01:23:19,725 --> 01:23:20,863
Give me the key, Joe.

956
01:23:22,927 --> 01:23:24,991
Rube, come on.
This is crazy.

957
01:23:26,188 --> 01:23:27,886
Whose side are you on?

958
01:23:32,478 --> 01:23:33,501
My side.

959
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:36,607
Lou!

960
01:23:40,466 --> 01:23:40,967
Lou!

961
01:23:41,642 --> 01:23:42,317
Lou!

962
01:23:47,102 --> 01:23:47,526
Lou.

963
01:23:48,549 --> 01:23:50,285
Don't make me
shoot you too.

964
01:23:51,269 --> 01:23:52,812
Give me the key, Joe.

965
01:23:56,883 --> 01:23:57,519
Okay.

966
01:23:59,265 --> 01:24:00,481
Just take it easy.

967
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:11,728
You want the key, Ruber?

968
01:24:33,372 --> 01:24:34,086
Oh, my god.

969
01:24:38,195 --> 01:24:39,025
Helen, wait!

970
01:25:16,569 --> 01:25:17,340
Helen?

971
01:25:20,484 --> 01:25:21,256
It's okay.

972
01:25:40,105 --> 01:25:42,131
Yes, I need to report
a murder.

973
01:25:43,405 --> 01:25:45,025
Detective Joe Miller

974
01:25:45,643 --> 01:25:46,163
just...

975
01:25:46,395 --> 01:25:48,826
shot Lou Destefano,
his partner.

976
