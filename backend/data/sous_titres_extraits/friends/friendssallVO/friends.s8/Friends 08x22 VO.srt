1
00:00:04,653 --> 00:00:06,450
What are you looking at?

2
00:00:06,613 --> 00:00:10,526
A poster for that WWl movie l'm in.
Check it out.

3
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:13,247
Wow! lt looks really violent!

4
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:16,405
l know. l'm coming soon
to a theater near you.

5
00:00:16,573 --> 00:00:19,770
l'm in THX.
l'm unsuitable for children!

6
00:00:20,093 --> 00:00:23,802
-l cannot wait to see this.
-lt's generating Oscar buzz.

7
00:00:24,013 --> 00:00:27,210
-l started that!
-l thought l did!

8
00:00:27,413 --> 00:00:29,404
l just talked to my agent. . .

9
00:00:29,653 --> 00:00:33,407
. . .and the premiere is next week
and you're all invited!

10
00:00:33,613 --> 00:00:35,524
-Will we take a limo?
-Sure!

11
00:00:35,893 --> 00:00:39,488
l love taking limos
when nobody died.

12
00:00:39,693 --> 00:00:41,763
Well, l won't be able to come.

13
00:00:41,973 --> 00:00:47,172
For those who haven't checked
their calendars, today's my due date.

14
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:51,451
l want to thank you guys
for how great you've been during this.

15
00:00:51,613 --> 00:00:55,731
l couldn't have done it without you.
l loved these last 9 months.

16
00:00:55,893 --> 00:00:58,088
l'm looking forward
to the next part. . .

17
00:00:58,493 --> 00:01:02,566
. . .but l am really gonna miss
being pregnant.

18
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:09,409
That's right. Still no baby.

19
00:01:09,573 --> 00:01:11,768
Come on, people, make some room.

20
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:15,608
Sweetie, maybe you'd be
more comfortable here.

21
00:01:16,893 --> 00:01:18,451
You.

22
00:01:21,053 --> 00:01:23,851
Like you haven't done enough.

23
00:01:24,973 --> 00:01:29,091
l know you're miserable.
l wish there was something l could do.

24
00:01:29,253 --> 00:01:32,529
l wish l were a sea horse.

25
00:01:34,853 --> 00:01:40,246
Because with sea horses, it's the male.
They carry the babies.

26
00:01:41,493 --> 00:01:46,328
And then also,
l'd be far away in the sea.

27
00:01:57,173 --> 00:01:58,686
God.

28
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:04,367
l have never been so uncomfortable
in my entire life.

29
00:02:04,573 --> 00:02:06,848
l know. l remember toward the end--

30
00:02:07,053 --> 00:02:11,888
That's a great story. Tell it while
you're getting me some iced tea.

31
00:02:14,573 --> 00:02:18,566
Oh, God, get out!
Get out, get out, get out!

32
00:02:20,493 --> 00:02:22,563
Let's.

33
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:26,169
The One Where Rachel is Late

34
00:03:03,413 --> 00:03:06,246
Hey, did you have the baby yet?

35
00:03:08,413 --> 00:03:11,803
Do you want me to sit on you?
Because l'll do it.

36
00:03:12,413 --> 00:03:15,883
-What are you doing here?
-They sent me home from work.

37
00:03:16,093 --> 00:03:19,449
They said, ''Start your maternity
leave now. Just rest. ''

38
00:03:19,613 --> 00:03:21,524
You know what? Screw them!

39
00:03:21,693 --> 00:03:25,402
lf they don't want me there,
l'll hang out with you guys.

40
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,604
Or you could do volunteer work.

41
00:03:31,053 --> 00:03:33,647
-Hello?
-Joey, it's Estelle.

42
00:03:33,893 --> 00:03:38,728
l was able to get you and one guest
tickets to your premiere.

43
00:03:38,933 --> 00:03:43,529
-You told me l could have six tickets.
-l sold four on eBay.

44
00:03:45,613 --> 00:03:48,286
You'll be sitting next to HotGuy372.

45
00:03:49,893 --> 00:03:53,010
So that's it? l only get
to bring one guest?

46
00:03:53,213 --> 00:03:57,206
Yeah. What time do you
want to pick me up?

47
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:59,205
Hello?

48
00:04:00,013 --> 00:04:03,289
You hear that?
l only get one extra ticket.

49
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:07,611
So somehow l have to pick
between you three and Ross.

50
00:04:09,213 --> 00:04:12,649
-What about me?
-You said you didn't want to go.

51
00:04:12,893 --> 00:04:15,646
l would still like
to be acknowledged.

52
00:04:15,893 --> 00:04:20,603
-Because l'm pregnant, l'm invisible?
-Definitely not invisible.

53
00:04:22,693 --> 00:04:26,242
Ross didn't care enough
to be here, so he's out.

54
00:04:26,493 --> 00:04:30,122
-You snooze, you lose.
-He's not snoozing. He's teaching.

55
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,528
Well, then somebody's snoozing.

56
00:04:32,693 --> 00:04:37,813
And, Joey, not that this should affect
you at all, but if you pick me. . .

57
00:04:38,013 --> 00:04:43,485
. . .l was planning on wearing
a sequin dress cut down to here.

58
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:48,406
-l haven't seen this dress.
-Star in a movie.

59
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:53,529
Pick whoever you want. Listen
to your heart. What does it tell you?

60
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:56,605
Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe.

61
00:04:58,053 --> 00:04:59,725
Well. . . .

62
00:05:02,253 --> 00:05:04,608
l think l want to take Chandler.

63
00:05:04,813 --> 00:05:08,203
Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe.

64
00:05:09,973 --> 00:05:13,807
-You want to take me?
-Yeah, l wish l could take everybody.

65
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,891
But Chandler's always
supported my career.

66
00:05:17,053 --> 00:05:20,409
He's paid for acting classes,
headshots and stuff.

67
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:23,252
This will be my way
of paying you back.

68
00:05:23,413 --> 00:05:27,406
So you're never actually
going to pay me back?

69
00:05:28,813 --> 00:05:32,931
Just because he paid for your
headshots, you're gonna take him?

70
00:05:33,093 --> 00:05:38,008
l don't think you're comprehending
just how slutty this dress is.

71
00:05:38,813 --> 00:05:43,250
lt's not just the stuff he paid for.
lt's everything, you know?

72
00:05:43,493 --> 00:05:47,372
He read lines with me.
He went with me on auditions.

73
00:05:47,653 --> 00:05:50,725
Then he consoled me
after l didn't get parts.

74
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:54,369
You always believed in me, man,
even when l didn't.

75
00:05:54,573 --> 00:05:58,566
l always knew you were gonna make it.
l'm so proud of you.

76
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:02,408
Thanks, that means a lot to me.

77
00:06:04,893 --> 00:06:08,806
Mon, maybe one of these guys
wants to wear your dress.

78
00:06:09,213 --> 00:06:14,162
-l'm gonna go shave.
-Yeah, well, l'm gonna go spit.

79
00:06:18,893 --> 00:06:20,406
l have to pee.

80
00:06:20,573 --> 00:06:25,693
lf l don't come out, it's because l've
choked to death on the potpourri stink.

81
00:06:27,213 --> 00:06:33,209
You hold her nose, l'll blow in her
mouth and the kid'll just. . .out of her.

82
00:06:34,773 --> 00:06:37,845
She's a week late.
She's got to have it today.

83
00:06:38,013 --> 00:06:42,245
l don't know. l think
it's still gonna be a while.

84
00:06:42,493 --> 00:06:44,848
Care to make it interesting?

85
00:06:45,053 --> 00:06:48,329
-l bet you she'll have it tomorrow.
-You're on.

86
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,969
-Okay, how much?
-One hundred thousand dollars.

87
00:06:53,253 --> 00:06:58,088
-How about 50 bucks?
-l'll call Zurich and move some money.

88
00:06:58,253 --> 00:07:01,643
All right, whose turn is it
to help me get up?

89
00:07:02,893 --> 00:07:04,611
No one's here.

90
00:07:07,053 --> 00:07:09,248
Oh, damn it!

91
00:07:21,773 --> 00:07:26,722
This is exciting. So glamorous! People
taking our picture. How do l look?

92
00:07:27,173 --> 00:07:29,767
-A little tall.
-What?

93
00:07:29,973 --> 00:07:34,012
Would you crouch down a bit
so that l look taller?

94
00:07:35,173 --> 00:07:37,403
There you go.

95
00:07:38,973 --> 00:07:41,612
lt's just so glamorous.

96
00:07:44,813 --> 00:07:47,611
Oh, hey, Mon? Rach is here.

97
00:07:47,813 --> 00:07:50,611
And you're still pregnant.

98
00:07:50,813 --> 00:07:53,725
l'm sorry. l know
how uncomfortable you are.

99
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:58,723
You know what? You look great.
Yeah, like 50 bucks.

100
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:05,925
l have to go pee. Apparently this baby
thinks my bladder is a squeeze toy.

101
00:08:07,693 --> 00:08:11,129
Damn it. Here's your 50 bucks.

102
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:16,328
That's interesting that you lost.
Now, l forget, do you like to lose?

103
00:08:16,493 --> 00:08:18,609
All right, stop it.

104
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:21,890
-Double or nothing she has it tomorrow.
-Fine.

105
00:08:22,093 --> 00:08:27,611
Until then, General Grant, why don't
you set up camp. . .right there?

106
00:08:28,693 --> 00:08:32,208
-Rachel here? We have an appointment.
-ln the bathroom.

107
00:08:32,413 --> 00:08:35,530
-Rach, we gotta go.
-ln a minute!

108
00:08:37,573 --> 00:08:42,727
People ask why we're not together.
l just don't know what to tell them.

109
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:46,687
-All right, let's go.
-Do you want to go change first?

110
00:08:46,933 --> 00:08:50,687
The doctor's staying open late for us,
but if you hurry. . . .

111
00:08:51,973 --> 00:08:55,409
-No, l'm fine.
-You don't think that's inappropriate?

112
00:08:55,973 --> 00:09:00,364
-What?
-Good God, man. Don't anger it.

113
00:09:02,613 --> 00:09:08,245
Ross, it is 1 00 degrees outside.
For the first time in weeks, l am--

114
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:11,928
Fine. Whatever you want.
You're the mommy.

115
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,004
No! Don't call me ''Mommy. ''

116
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:17,882
lt's bad enough you call
your own mother that.

117
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:21,491
l'm actually with her on this one.

118
00:09:27,853 --> 00:09:30,413
<i>I thought I knew who the enemy was--</i>

119
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:34,925
Okay, this is it. This is
my big fight scene coming up.

120
00:09:35,373 --> 00:09:39,002
<i>I'm fighting for every man</i>
<i>in the 82nd Ground Division.</i>

121
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:50,569
Ross?
Can l ask you something?

122
00:09:50,773 --> 00:09:54,607
When Carol was pregnant with Ben. . .

123
00:09:55,093 --> 00:09:57,687
. . .were you this irritating?

124
00:10:01,093 --> 00:10:03,209
-Excuse me?
-Nothing. You're just. . . .

125
00:10:03,373 --> 00:10:08,401
You've been a little short with me
lately. l'm not trying to irritate you.

126
00:10:08,573 --> 00:10:12,407
Well, then, you must have
a natural talent for it.

127
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:18,364
The doctor will be in soon.
Why don't we not speak until then?

128
00:10:22,653 --> 00:10:25,850
Seriously. Breathe louder, Ross.
That's great.

129
00:10:29,013 --> 00:10:32,005
We should ask the doctor
if she even knows. . .

130
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:37,406
. . .how to deliver a baby
that's half human, half pure evil!

131
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:42,731
-Hi, Dr. Long. How are you?
-You're nice to her.

132
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,766
She has the drugs.

133
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:48,923
We'll do a quick check.

134
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:52,762
Eight days late, huh?
You must be getting uncomfortable.

135
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:55,401
Yeah, just a tad.

136
00:10:56,293 --> 00:11:01,083
You're 80<i>°/°</i> effaced. You're on your way.
lt still could last a while.

137
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:06,208
-There are ways to help things along.
-Do them!

138
00:11:07,093 --> 00:11:10,768
Actually, they're things
you can do. Home remedies.

139
00:11:10,973 --> 00:11:14,602
ln my experience, l've found
some are very effective.

140
00:11:14,813 --> 00:11:20,206
-Well, we are ready to try anything.
-There's an herbal tea you can drink.

141
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:23,928
You can take some castor oil.
There's spicy foods.

142
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:25,851
We will do all of those.

143
00:11:26,093 --> 00:11:28,323
-Taking a long walk.
-Good. Done.

144
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:33,402
And there's the one that's
proved most effective: sex.

145
00:11:37,813 --> 00:11:41,169
You've got to be kidding me!

146
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:57,525
Good job, Joe! Well done! Top-notch!

147
00:11:58,173 --> 00:12:01,290
-You liked it? You really liked it?
-Oh, yeah!

148
00:12:01,493 --> 00:12:05,805
-Well, which part exactly?
-The whole thing! Here we go!

149
00:12:06,013 --> 00:12:08,288
No, no, no. Give me some specifics.

150
00:12:08,493 --> 00:12:12,372
l loved the specifics.
The specifics were the best part.

151
00:12:12,573 --> 00:12:18,170
Hey, what about the scene with
the kangaroo? Did you like that part?

152
00:12:18,413 --> 00:12:23,806
l was surprised to see a kangaroo
in a World War l epic.

153
00:12:24,813 --> 00:12:26,963
You fell asleep!

154
00:12:27,173 --> 00:12:32,122
There was no kangaroo! They didn't
take any of my suggestions!

155
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:39,008
-Thanks for coming. See you later.
-Don't go. l'm so sorry.

156
00:12:39,173 --> 00:12:43,212
Look, this guy fell asleep!
He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!

157
00:12:44,373 --> 00:12:47,570
Or call an ambulance!

158
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:54,607
What did the doctor say?
Any news on when the baby will come?

159
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:58,083
No. She gave us ideas
on how to induce labor.

160
00:12:58,253 --> 00:12:59,606
We tried them all.

161
00:12:59,773 --> 00:13:05,325
We went for a walk, we tried tea,
castor oil, spicy food. Nothing worked.

162
00:13:05,573 --> 00:13:07,803
There is one thing we didn't try.

163
00:13:07,973 --> 00:13:11,932
But someone thinks that
that will open up a can of worms.

164
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:15,842
lf it's gonna help
bring the baby here, today. . .

165
00:13:16,013 --> 00:13:18,481
. . .l think you should do it.

166
00:13:19,813 --> 00:13:23,169
-lt's sex.
-Do it!

167
00:13:23,493 --> 00:13:27,008
-Monica.
-lt's been a really long time for you.

168
00:13:27,213 --> 00:13:32,367
l mean, women have needs.
Do it. Get yours.

169
00:13:33,093 --> 00:13:35,368
Oh, l don't know about that.

170
00:13:36,653 --> 00:13:42,728
l think if the two of you had sex, the
repercussions would be catastrophic.

171
00:13:43,653 --> 00:13:45,803
All right, let's be practical.

172
00:13:46,013 --> 00:13:51,849
lf Ross isn't willing, he's not
the only guy you can have sex with.

173
00:13:52,053 --> 00:13:55,250
You could borrow Chandler.
Chandler is good.

174
00:13:56,373 --> 00:13:59,171
Monica, what is the matter with you?

175
00:13:59,413 --> 00:14:02,769
-l just want the baby to be born today.
-Why today?

176
00:14:03,773 --> 00:14:05,570
Okay, fine.

177
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:10,609
l bet Phoebe that you're gonna have
the baby, and l don't want to lose.

178
00:14:11,053 --> 00:14:16,207
What? While she's been going through
this hell, you've been making money?

179
00:14:16,413 --> 00:14:20,770
You're betting on your friend
staying in this misery?

180
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:26,323
-l'll take that bet.
-What?

181
00:14:26,493 --> 00:14:30,406
l'm miserable. l may as well
make some money out of it.

182
00:14:30,573 --> 00:14:32,803
Can l get some of that action?

183
00:14:33,053 --> 00:14:35,283
l'm betting against all of you?

184
00:14:35,493 --> 00:14:38,326
l really feel like
tomorrow it's gonna happen.

185
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:40,205
Okay.

186
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:49,325
Hey, Sleeping Beauty.

187
00:14:49,493 --> 00:14:53,532
Where have you been?
l want to talk to you. l still feel bad.

188
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:57,169
Oh, no. Were you upset?
Did you lose sleep?

189
00:14:57,933 --> 00:14:59,252
l'm so sorry.

190
00:14:59,453 --> 00:15:03,128
The reason l came over is
to settle things between us.

191
00:15:03,293 --> 00:15:07,286
l wanted to pay you back
with the premiere, but you missed it.

192
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:09,683
-So how much do l owe you?
-What?

193
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:13,369
-l don't want to owe you anything.
-You don't owe me.

194
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:16,047
-l don't want your--
-We're doing this!

195
00:15:16,253 --> 00:15:18,972
You got me my first headshots.
How much?

196
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:23,451
-l don't know, $500.
-Okay, $500. What else?

197
00:15:23,653 --> 00:15:28,249
Then there was the second set.
The infamous ''booger'' headshots.

198
00:15:29,293 --> 00:15:33,366
Okay, so that's another $500.
That's 500 and 500. That's. . . .

199
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:40,445
-You want a calculator?
-Please.

200
00:15:41,653 --> 00:15:43,291
Here.

201
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,966
All right, what else?

202
00:15:49,173 --> 00:15:53,883
Well, there's acting classes,
stage-combat classes, tap classes--

203
00:15:54,093 --> 00:15:56,891
Which we're still keeping
under our hats.

204
00:15:57,093 --> 00:16:01,371
That dialect coach who helped you
with a Southern accent.

205
00:16:01,533 --> 00:16:05,845
Which, after 20 hours of lessons,
still came out Jamaican.

206
00:16:06,693 --> 00:16:12,051
What the hell are you talking about?
The South will rise again, man.

207
00:16:14,613 --> 00:16:17,207
Yes, money well-spent.

208
00:16:17,413 --> 00:16:19,483
Okay, what else? Rent.

209
00:16:19,693 --> 00:16:24,164
Two, three years of rent,
utilities, food. . . .

210
00:16:24,413 --> 00:16:28,725
Okay, so l'm writing you
a check for. . . .

211
00:16:29,693 --> 00:16:35,484
So you fell asleep during my movie.
Big deal, right?

212
00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:38,645
How do you clear this thing?

213
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:44,689
Finish your enchilada.

214
00:16:44,853 --> 00:16:48,687
Ross, we've tried all the spicy food.
lt's not working.

215
00:16:48,853 --> 00:16:52,050
Okay, here, have one of these peppers.

216
00:16:54,773 --> 00:16:59,164
Oh, God. So hot. Oh, my God.

217
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:04,853
By the way, you don't want to touch
the pepper and then touch your eye.

218
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:09,929
l am feeling nothing.

219
00:17:12,813 --> 00:17:15,805
Speaking of hot,
watching you do that. . .

220
00:17:15,973 --> 00:17:19,522
. . .really makes me want
to have sex with you.

221
00:17:19,933 --> 00:17:23,323
-Stop it.
-Come on! Why are we wasting time?

222
00:17:23,493 --> 00:17:27,850
We know it's gonna work.
lt's doctor-recommended.

223
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:33,645
l'm sorry. But we have to have
some boundaries. My God, l'm dying.

224
00:17:33,813 --> 00:17:36,691
We've done it before.
We'll do it again.

225
00:17:36,853 --> 00:17:39,890
lt'll be a nice way
to bookend the pregnancy.

226
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:43,489
l'm not gonna make love to you
so you'll go into labor.

227
00:17:43,693 --> 00:17:47,049
Make love? What are you, a girl?

228
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:51,884
Always a great way to get
into a man's pants.

229
00:17:52,093 --> 00:17:56,484
You'll be performing a service.
Think of me as a ketchup bottle.

230
00:17:56,653 --> 00:18:01,169
Sometimes, you have to bang on
the end of it to get it to come out.

231
00:18:03,093 --> 00:18:06,449
l love when you talk dirty to me.

232
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:10,331
l know it. You're right.
That's not sexy.

233
00:18:13,653 --> 00:18:17,009
Oh, l seem to have dropped my fork.

234
00:18:17,213 --> 00:18:19,568
Let me just bend over and get it.

235
00:18:26,733 --> 00:18:28,212
Oh, God!

236
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:34,449
Okay, enough.
This is not going to happen.

237
00:18:34,693 --> 00:18:37,161
Come on, Ross. l'm miserable here.

238
00:18:37,373 --> 00:18:41,048
Come on, you started this,
now you finish it!

239
00:18:41,613 --> 00:18:44,411
Come on, wuss. Make love to me.

240
00:18:46,013 --> 00:18:49,050
-You know what?
-What?

241
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,244
Forget it.

242
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:55,284
What now, Ross,
you're not gonna talk?

243
00:18:55,453 --> 00:18:59,048
How on earth will you ever annoy me?

244
00:18:59,293 --> 00:19:02,251
Oh, wait a minute, l know.

245
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:09,372
You'd think the jalapeño would
clear up your sinuses, but no!

246
00:19:09,613 --> 00:19:12,081
That's not enough--
What are you doing?

247
00:19:12,253 --> 00:19:15,484
l'm getting that baby out of you!

248
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:23,285
-Oh, God!
-l know.

249
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:25,569
Oh, no, no, no.

250
00:19:26,293 --> 00:19:29,046
l think my water just broke.

251
00:19:29,613 --> 00:19:32,252
l am good!

252
00:19:33,533 --> 00:19:37,492
Okay, l got the pillow.
l got the bag.

253
00:19:37,653 --> 00:19:40,725
-You got the keys?
-l got the keys.

254
00:19:45,253 --> 00:19:46,925
We're having a baby.

255
00:19:59,773 --> 00:20:04,528
l didn't have time to read this part
of the books, but do we have time--?

256
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:07,486
-Not so much.
-Okay, let's go.

257
00:20:11,933 --> 00:20:13,127
-200.
-Thank you.

258
00:20:13,293 --> 00:20:18,447
That's it. l don't care when
the baby comes. No more betting.

259
00:20:20,213 --> 00:20:21,851
Hello?

260
00:20:29,013 --> 00:20:32,289
l guess we could bet
one more time.

261
00:20:32,453 --> 00:20:36,765
-ls Rachel having the baby?
-How did you know that?

262
00:20:37,013 --> 00:20:40,085
-Joey! Chandler!
-They're at the coffee house.

263
00:20:40,293 --> 00:20:42,648
You know everything!

264
00:20:42,893 --> 00:20:46,124
Wait. l bet you the baby
is over 7 pounds.

265
00:20:47,293 --> 00:20:50,888
l bet you it has hair!
l bet you it's a girl.

266
00:20:51,053 --> 00:20:54,648
-We know it's a girl.
-l'll give you really good odds.
