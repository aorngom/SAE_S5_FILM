<i>Previously:</i>

2
00:00:03,773 --> 00:00:07,243
There's this woman that l like a lot.

3
00:00:07,493 --> 00:00:09,563
But it's complicated.

4
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:13,009
She was with this other guy
for a long time.

5
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:16,410
l could never do that to the guy.
We're friends.

6
00:00:16,613 --> 00:00:20,606
So this guy she used to go out with,
is he a good guy?

7
00:00:22,173 --> 00:00:23,367
The best.

8
00:00:23,573 --> 00:00:26,007
-Then talk to him.
-l don't know.

9
00:00:26,253 --> 00:00:29,404
lt's worth finding out,
if you like her.

10
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:31,205
l do, so much.

11
00:00:31,453 --> 00:00:34,092
l can't stop thinking about her.
l can't--

12
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:37,609
You know what?
You have to go for it.

13
00:00:37,813 --> 00:00:42,443
How often does this happen to you?
You owe it to yourself.

14
00:00:43,613 --> 00:00:45,444
lt's Rachel.

15
00:00:54,493 --> 00:00:57,963
l'm sorry, did you just say
it's Rachel?

16
00:00:59,373 --> 00:01:00,965
Yes.

17
00:01:04,253 --> 00:01:05,606
You like Rachel?

18
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:10,564
Yes. l like Rachel.

19
00:01:17,413 --> 00:01:18,926
Rachel?!

20
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,325
Yeah. Okay, but look, you know. . . .

21
00:01:22,573 --> 00:01:24,803
You know who else l like? You.

22
00:01:25,053 --> 00:01:28,648
And it doesn't get said enough.
l like you, Ross.

23
00:01:30,853 --> 00:01:33,162
-Rachel Rachel?
-lt's not a big deal.

24
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:36,689
lt's not a big deal?
l'm sorry, l just. . . .

25
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:40,003
What about the stuff you said?

26
00:01:40,253 --> 00:01:44,724
How you can't stop thinking about her?
How you can't sleep?

27
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:46,685
l'm an actor, you know?

28
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:50,642
As a group, we tend to be
overdramatic.

29
00:01:50,853 --> 00:01:53,970
Rachel-who's-carrying-my-baby Rachel?

30
00:01:54,173 --> 00:01:57,404
l know it's bad.
And l know it's wrong, okay?

31
00:01:57,613 --> 00:02:00,605
lt's not like anything's
ever gonna happen.

32
00:02:00,853 --> 00:02:03,686
These are just feelings.
They'll go away.

33
00:02:04,453 --> 00:02:06,330
You know, l gotta go.

34
00:02:06,573 --> 00:02:07,801
Hey, Ross--

35
00:02:08,013 --> 00:02:11,801
You know, l just have one--
Rachel?!

36
00:02:22,973 --> 00:02:24,565
Rachel?!

37
00:02:26,653 --> 00:02:28,769
The One Where Joey Tells Rachel

38
00:03:02,373 --> 00:03:05,046
Okay, she's kicking.

39
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:08,367
She's growing inside you.

40
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:14,130
-That was a big one.
-That's the youngest girl to reject me.

41
00:03:15,013 --> 00:03:16,446
-You guys!
-Hey there.

42
00:03:16,693 --> 00:03:19,810
Let me ask you.
Do you believe in soul mates?

43
00:03:20,053 --> 00:03:21,247
Oh, yes, l do.

44
00:03:21,453 --> 00:03:24,126
There's one person out there
for everyone.

45
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:27,206
You know how you find him?
Stop looking.

46
00:03:27,453 --> 00:03:30,331
l've stopped looking
for Russell Crowe.

47
00:03:30,573 --> 00:03:32,291
He'll find me.

48
00:03:32,493 --> 00:03:33,562
And you?

49
00:03:33,853 --> 00:03:38,802
No. l believe that certain people are
more suited for each other, but. . . .

50
00:03:39,013 --> 00:03:41,527
-Soul mates? l don't think they exist.
-Good.

51
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:44,406
-Why?
-Well, last night, l met Monica's.

52
00:03:49,053 --> 00:03:50,247
What?

53
00:03:50,493 --> 00:03:54,202
l had a date with this guy.
l swear he's her other half.

54
00:03:54,413 --> 00:03:59,362
You don't think there's somebody
better suited for Monica than me?

55
00:04:02,373 --> 00:04:04,329
Well, what's he like?

56
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:07,805
-He's tall. He has brown hair.
-Of course.

57
00:04:08,013 --> 00:04:12,291
A tall guy with hair similar to mine?
Oh, unknowable universe!

58
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:15,401
-He works with food.
-Oh, sure. Older?

59
00:04:15,613 --> 00:04:19,003
-Obviously. And he's British.
-l was just gonna ask!

60
00:04:19,213 --> 00:04:23,491
And he's so centered,
and mature and confident.

61
00:04:23,693 --> 00:04:26,048
lt's so sad they never met.

62
00:04:26,253 --> 00:04:30,610
Luckily, the guy she settled for
can't hear you.

63
00:04:31,053 --> 00:04:33,521
Oh, l'm so sorry.
Maybe l'm wrong.

64
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,571
We're going out again.
l'll find out more.

65
00:04:36,773 --> 00:04:39,606
He's meant for her,
and you're gonna date him?

66
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:42,930
He may not be my soul mate,
but a girl's gotta eat.

67
00:04:50,013 --> 00:04:53,130
l talked to Joey.
l wanted to see you.

68
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:57,246
l still can't believe it.
Joey and Rachel?

69
00:04:57,453 --> 00:05:00,445
lt's like you and me going out,
only weirder.

70
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:03,404
l know you're hurting. . .

71
00:05:03,653 --> 00:05:05,530
. . .but don't say that again.

72
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:11,206
What if they marry?
He'd be the stepfather of my child.

73
00:05:11,413 --> 00:05:13,449
You don't need to worry.

74
00:05:13,693 --> 00:05:16,048
He'll never tell her how he feels.

75
00:05:16,293 --> 00:05:19,046
lf he did, you don't know
how she'd react.

76
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:23,087
Sure, women never like Joey.
l think he's a virgin.

77
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:27,892
-He isn't thinking about going for her.
-He's not?

78
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:31,648
All he's thinking about
is how you're taking this.

79
00:05:31,893 --> 00:05:35,647
lt's freaking him out.
He wants to move to Vermont.

80
00:05:36,613 --> 00:05:40,003
-Why?
-He wants to leave the country.

81
00:05:44,413 --> 00:05:46,210
He thinks you hate him.

82
00:05:47,373 --> 00:05:48,852
Hate him?

83
00:05:50,253 --> 00:05:52,847
No, l don't hate him.

84
00:05:55,253 --> 00:05:58,051
lt's just, it's Rachel. You know?

85
00:05:58,293 --> 00:06:02,206
l can't even imagine how hard
this must be for you. . .

86
00:06:02,413 --> 00:06:06,247
. . .but l don't want you
to lose Joey over it.

87
00:06:06,493 --> 00:06:10,691
Right now, he needs to know
that you're still his friend.

88
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:14,811
Okay, l'll talk to him.

89
00:06:15,053 --> 00:06:16,645
l'd do it soon.

90
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:21,569
He just asked me how to convert
his dollars into Vermont money.

91
00:06:28,093 --> 00:06:29,572
-Hi!
-Hi.

92
00:06:29,773 --> 00:06:33,004
-Chandler, Monica, this is Don.
-Hello.

93
00:06:35,293 --> 00:06:36,851
Soul mate.

94
00:06:39,773 --> 00:06:43,129
-What are you guys doing?
-We had lunch at Adriatica.

95
00:06:43,373 --> 00:06:47,810
-What's with the sun-dried tomatoes?
-l know! ls this 1 985?

96
00:06:48,013 --> 00:06:51,562
-That's what l said! lsn't it strange?
-Not really.

97
00:06:52,853 --> 00:06:55,287
What's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?

98
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:59,806
On a barbecued-chicken pizza?

99
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:01,406
No?

100
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:06,243
-What restaurants do you like?
-Octavio. 27-and-7.

101
00:07:06,453 --> 00:07:10,605
-There's this place, Alessandro's.
-Oh, my God! l'm the chef!

102
00:07:10,813 --> 00:07:13,532
You're kidding!
Your food is fantastic!

103
00:07:13,773 --> 00:07:17,686
l want to talk about your menu.
Anyone want coffee?

104
00:07:17,893 --> 00:07:21,010
lf you're talking about me,
l'll go with you.

105
00:07:23,653 --> 00:07:25,245
What are you doing?

106
00:07:25,853 --> 00:07:29,084
l swear, l didn't know you guys
would be here.

107
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,642
You don't believe in soul mates, so. . . .

108
00:07:31,853 --> 00:07:35,641
l believe in handsome strangers
who hit on my wife.

109
00:07:35,853 --> 00:07:40,847
Just because l think they're soul mates
doesn't mean anything'll happen.

110
00:07:41,053 --> 00:07:43,283
Phoebe? Good work.

111
00:07:43,493 --> 00:07:46,053
He's great. l love him.

112
00:07:48,453 --> 00:07:51,445
Don't worry, we'll find you
someone else.

113
00:08:03,973 --> 00:08:07,602
l understand if you came by to hit me.
l deserve it.

114
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:10,008
No, l don't want to hit you.

115
00:08:10,213 --> 00:08:12,602
What, then? Kick me?

116
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:14,127
No.

117
00:08:15,053 --> 00:08:16,725
Bite me?

118
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,847
l don't want to do anything to you.

119
00:08:20,093 --> 00:08:23,165
l just want to say l'm not
mad at you. . .

120
00:08:24,573 --> 00:08:27,724
. . .and that l certainly
do not hate you.

121
00:08:28,893 --> 00:08:31,407
l just came here to say that.

122
00:08:31,613 --> 00:08:33,843
Hey, wait, Ross?

123
00:08:35,093 --> 00:08:38,768
You wanna come in
for a beer or something?

124
00:08:40,973 --> 00:08:42,804
Yeah, sure.

125
00:08:46,453 --> 00:08:48,967
You got any beer?

126
00:08:51,693 --> 00:08:54,810
All l got is melon stuff
that Rachel left.

127
00:08:55,213 --> 00:08:56,532
Okay.

128
00:09:03,893 --> 00:09:06,885
You need to understand something.

129
00:09:10,653 --> 00:09:14,805
l am never gonna act
on this Rachel thing, okay?

130
00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:19,649
l wouldn't do anything to jeopardize
my friendship with you.

131
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:22,366
Thank you.

132
00:09:38,213 --> 00:09:42,365
Anyway, it'll just. . . .

133
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:45,809
lt'll take me a while to get over her.

134
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:50,012
l'm not sure how to do that.
l've never been in love, so. . . .

135
00:09:50,253 --> 00:09:51,686
What?

136
00:09:54,173 --> 00:09:56,607
You're in love with her?

137
00:09:56,853 --> 00:10:01,324
-Yeah. l thought you knew that.
-No.

138
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:07,411
Look, if it helps, l don't want
to feel this way, honest.

139
00:10:07,613 --> 00:10:11,811
l just keep thinking,
''l'll get over this,'' you know?

140
00:10:12,053 --> 00:10:15,807
But it just keeps getting harder.

141
00:10:16,013 --> 00:10:19,323
l don't know what to do, you know?

142
00:10:20,773 --> 00:10:22,809
What do l do?

143
00:10:28,413 --> 00:10:34,329
-You need to tell her how you feel.
-That's the green stuff talking.

144
00:10:36,253 --> 00:10:39,609
l'm serious.
You need to find out where she is.

145
00:10:39,853 --> 00:10:43,562
lf she's not where you are,
you can start to move on.

146
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:46,845
But what if,
and l'm not saying she will be--

147
00:10:47,053 --> 00:10:50,250
lf she is where you are. . .

148
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:56,726
. . .then my feeling weird
shouldn't stand in the way.

149
00:10:57,213 --> 00:10:59,681
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

150
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,653
lf she ends up with somebody else. . .

151
00:11:03,893 --> 00:11:07,568
. . .the truth is,
she couldn't find a better guy.

152
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,051
Hey, thanks.

153
00:11:11,293 --> 00:11:16,367
-So when are you gonna talk to her?
-Oh, my God. l have to tell her.

154
00:11:17,453 --> 00:11:20,763
l haven't thought about it.
What should l say?

155
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:24,648
l'm understanding,
but let's not get carried away.

156
00:11:27,213 --> 00:11:29,010
What am l gonna say?

157
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,122
Yeah, tell me about it.

158
00:11:49,013 --> 00:11:53,962
l'm phasing out the wine importing
and focusing more on the cheese.

159
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:56,004
Cheese, you say?

160
00:11:56,253 --> 00:11:59,404
That's some
pretty smelly work, huh, Don?

161
00:12:00,013 --> 00:12:03,483
-Excuse me?
-Cheese. lt's smelly.

162
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,689
You must smell a lot of the time too.

163
00:12:09,413 --> 00:12:13,850
Not really. But with cheese,
l think the smellier, the better.

164
00:12:14,053 --> 00:12:18,569
Me too! Chandler hates it.
l can't have blue cheese in the house.

165
00:12:18,773 --> 00:12:21,731
And you're still married to him?

166
00:12:25,693 --> 00:12:31,211
l would like to go to France and eat
nothing but bread and cheese.

167
00:12:31,453 --> 00:12:33,603
Not even bread. Just cheese.

168
00:12:33,813 --> 00:12:35,644
No, l want the bread.

169
00:12:36,253 --> 00:12:38,164
And pastries.

170
00:12:38,453 --> 00:12:40,409
And pâté.

171
00:12:40,773 --> 00:12:44,288
l'm really not high.
l just used to be fat.

172
00:12:45,013 --> 00:12:48,449
l have a villa in the Loire Valley
you can stay in.

173
00:12:48,653 --> 00:12:50,689
ls it made of cheese?

174
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:56,969
No. A house made of cheese,
wouldn't that be great?

175
00:12:57,173 --> 00:12:59,892
-l'd move in tomorrow!
-Oh, come on!

176
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,723
-Listen to this!
-l'm so sorry.

177
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:08,085
-What do we do?
-They both want a house of cheese.

178
00:13:08,773 --> 00:13:11,526
l don't know how you fight that.

179
00:13:17,573 --> 00:13:21,851
Okay, okay. l can do this.
l can tell her how l feel.

180
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,323
Okay, stand up straight.

181
00:13:24,573 --> 00:13:27,326
Take a couple deep breaths.

182
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:30,690
Look confident.

183
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,290
Joey? What's up?

184
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:40,731
l came by because
l want to talk to you about something.

185
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:41,968
What's up?

186
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:45,211
Here, in the hall?
What are we, animals?

187
00:13:45,413 --> 00:13:48,723
l'm late for a meeting.
Could you make it quick?

188
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:52,405
l just came by to tell you that. . .

189
00:13:52,773 --> 00:13:56,482
. . .l want to have dinner with you.

190
00:13:56,693 --> 00:13:59,332
Sure. Just tell me where to meet you.

191
00:14:02,973 --> 00:14:04,452
Okay. That's good.

192
00:14:04,693 --> 00:14:07,844
That gives you a couple of hours
to prepare.

193
00:14:08,773 --> 00:14:11,241
Don't you people ever knock?

194
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:15,413
l'd like to have Don and Phoebe over.

195
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:17,012
Sure. Set it up.

196
00:14:17,213 --> 00:14:20,330
l'll just be browsing
through the personals.

197
00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:23,682
Are you okay?
You're acting weird.

198
00:14:23,893 --> 00:14:24,882
Yeah. Fine.

199
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:26,407
Not perfect.

200
00:14:26,613 --> 00:14:28,444
But good enough.

201
00:14:28,853 --> 00:14:30,445
Jeez, what's with you?

202
00:14:30,653 --> 00:14:33,565
l'm sorry, did you say ''cheese''?

203
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:39,006
-What's going on?
-Phoebe says you and Don are soul mates.

204
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:42,330
l don't believe in that,
but you two get along.

205
00:14:42,573 --> 00:14:47,601
l'll step aside if you wanna go with
Don and live in a house of cheese.

206
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:52,722
-You don't believe in soul mates?
-No, but l'm sure ''tomatoes'' does.

207
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,971
l don't believe in soul mates, either.

208
00:14:57,173 --> 00:14:58,401
-You don't?
-Nope.

209
00:14:58,613 --> 00:15:01,127
We weren't destined
to end up together.

210
00:15:01,373 --> 00:15:04,809
We fell in love and work hard
at our relationship.

211
00:15:05,053 --> 00:15:07,613
Some days we work really hard.

212
00:15:08,213 --> 00:15:12,252
So you don't want to live with Don
in a cheese house?

213
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:18,210
No, l've had second thoughts.
Do you know how hard it'd be to clean?

214
00:15:18,453 --> 00:15:20,808
-l love you.
-l know.

215
00:15:21,013 --> 00:15:23,402
l'm gonna take you out to dinner.

216
00:15:23,613 --> 00:15:27,891
l found this place that makes
the greatest jalapeño poppers.

217
00:15:29,573 --> 00:15:31,484
No? They taste so good.

218
00:15:37,493 --> 00:15:40,883
lt happens whenever Chandler
touches my stomach.

219
00:15:41,093 --> 00:15:43,846
l'm worried the baby won't like him.

220
00:15:46,733 --> 00:15:49,884
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, sure.

221
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,166
Look, the reason. . . .

222
00:15:57,213 --> 00:15:59,090
ls it hot in here?

223
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:02,410
Why don't you take off your sweater?

224
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:05,244
This is a nice place. . .

225
00:16:05,493 --> 00:16:10,089
. . .and my T-shirt has a picture
of Calvin doing Hobbes.

226
00:16:10,293 --> 00:16:13,922
Oh, my God, really? Can l see it?

227
00:16:14,133 --> 00:16:15,327
Yeah, sure.

228
00:16:18,053 --> 00:16:21,568
l wouldn't think Hobbes
would like that so much.

229
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:30,081
How long have we known each other?

230
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:32,090
Seven, eight. . . .

231
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,801
Eight years. Wow.

232
00:16:35,253 --> 00:16:36,481
A long time.

233
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:40,646
But over the past few weeks, l--

234
00:16:40,893 --> 00:16:45,205
Okay! Sorry about the wait,
but it is mega-jammed in here.

235
00:16:45,413 --> 00:16:47,085
Our specials tonight--

236
00:16:47,293 --> 00:16:49,807
-Could you give us a second?
-Sure.

237
00:16:50,013 --> 00:16:51,287
Second's up!

238
00:16:54,573 --> 00:16:57,849
Not that kind of table.

239
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,486
So you were saying?

240
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,448
l'm not sure.

241
00:17:05,693 --> 00:17:10,209
You asked how long we knew each other,
and l said eight years.

242
00:17:10,453 --> 00:17:14,685
Then the waiter came over
and cut his tip in half. . .

243
00:17:16,413 --> 00:17:18,290
. . .and now here we are.

244
00:17:18,653 --> 00:17:21,565
Yeah. Here we are.

245
00:17:30,853 --> 00:17:33,686
l think l'm falling in love with you.

246
00:17:35,813 --> 00:17:37,292
What?

247
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:42,086
l'm falling in love with you.

248
00:17:50,013 --> 00:17:52,004
Who are you talking to?

249
00:17:53,533 --> 00:17:56,206
Oh, you're kidding. lt's a joke.

250
00:17:57,253 --> 00:17:59,050
Funny. lt's funny!

251
00:17:59,293 --> 00:18:01,284
l don't get it.

252
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:11,766
Okay.

253
00:18:15,293 --> 00:18:16,885
Wow.

254
00:18:19,573 --> 00:18:21,245
Are you. . .?

255
00:18:23,933 --> 00:18:26,208
How did. . .?

256
00:18:27,253 --> 00:18:28,447
When?

257
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:33,088
Does it really matter?

258
00:18:35,693 --> 00:18:37,411
Wow. Wow.

259
00:18:37,653 --> 00:18:39,723
lt is hot in here.

260
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:41,605
l know this is a lot.

261
00:18:41,853 --> 00:18:44,970
You don't have to say anything.

262
00:18:46,053 --> 00:18:49,250
You take as much time as you need.

263
00:18:55,933 --> 00:18:58,163
Okay, you gotta say something.

264
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:03,404
Joey, l love you so much.

265
00:19:03,613 --> 00:19:05,604
-But--
-But.

266
00:19:06,253 --> 00:19:07,811
Joey?

267
00:19:08,053 --> 00:19:10,567
Right. Hey, that's. . . .

268
00:19:10,853 --> 00:19:13,003
That's okay. That's fine.

269
00:19:13,213 --> 00:19:17,923
lt's pretty much what l was expecting.

270
00:19:19,293 --> 00:19:21,727
lt's no big deal, all right?

271
00:19:24,773 --> 00:19:28,402
-l think l'm gonna go.
-Please don't leave like this.

272
00:19:28,613 --> 00:19:32,208
You can't do this to a pregnant woman!

273
00:19:33,013 --> 00:19:34,605
Don't start doing that.

274
00:19:34,853 --> 00:19:38,243
You can't do that,
because you're gonna make me. . . .

275
00:19:38,453 --> 00:19:40,364
Oh, there we go!

276
00:19:42,773 --> 00:19:45,731
-Can l?
-Sure.

277
00:19:47,573 --> 00:19:50,007
Oh, Joey. l don't want to lose--

278
00:19:50,213 --> 00:19:52,249
Hey, hey.

279
00:19:54,053 --> 00:19:57,568
You can't, okay? Ever.

280
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:01,127
l'm so sorry.

281
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,291
Please don't be sorry.

282
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:06,649
Okay? Don't be sorry.

283
00:20:14,893 --> 00:20:17,407
You know, l was only kidding.

284
00:20:18,613 --> 00:20:20,843
Yeah, that was a real good one.

285
00:20:31,053 --> 00:20:32,884
-ls this your table?
-Yeah.

286
00:20:33,093 --> 00:20:35,482
-You'll be here all night.
-l know.

287
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:38,201
l haven't even read the specials.

288
00:20:38,693 --> 00:20:40,092
What's the matter?

289
00:20:40,293 --> 00:20:44,889
l don't know.
l think maybe one of them is dying.

290
00:20:47,293 --> 00:20:50,012
l kind of hope it's the girl.

291
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:53,925
The guy is really cute!
