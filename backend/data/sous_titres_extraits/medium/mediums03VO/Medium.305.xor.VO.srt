1
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:05,693
When I was little,
our next door neighbour Mrs Walters,

2
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:07,716
used to bring me
her daughter old clothes.

3
00:00:07,962 --> 00:00:09,712
I never wanted to wear them.

4
00:00:10,516 --> 00:00:12,360
It wasn't that I didn't
like the clothes,

5
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:14,151
it was the way they made me feel,

6
00:00:14,185 --> 00:00:15,991
whenever I put them on.

7
00:00:16,871 --> 00:00:17,787
Later,

8
00:00:17,806 --> 00:00:20,944
I found out that when Mrs. Walter's
little girl would misbehave,

9
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:22,575
she would lock her,

10
00:00:22,786 --> 00:00:24,410
in a dark closet.

11
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:31,587
Then there was a time I was about
to sit down and watch television.

12
00:00:31,928 --> 00:00:34,516
And suddenly got
the distinct impression,

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,200
that things between my babysitter

14
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:39,191
and her latest boyfriend had...

15
00:00:40,258 --> 00:00:42,242
moved to the next level.

16
00:00:47,127 --> 00:00:48,382
My point being,

17
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:52,113
that sometimes the energy from an event
can hang around a particular object

18
00:00:52,128 --> 00:00:54,130
long the event is over.

19
00:00:54,678 --> 00:00:56,760
Almost... like an emprint.

20
00:00:57,387 --> 00:00:59,031
And people like me,

21
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:00,992
people who are sensitive,

22
00:01:01,826 --> 00:01:03,732
it's almost as if we can read

23
00:01:04,008 --> 00:01:05,150
the energy,

24
00:01:05,368 --> 00:01:06,983
and know what happened.

25
00:01:08,385 --> 00:01:11,913
Like the time Boby Page
taught me to shoot with his dad's rifle.

26
00:01:14,088 --> 00:01:15,132
Not knowing

27
00:01:15,155 --> 00:01:18,233
his dad has just used it
to put down their old Retreiver Buck.

28
00:01:20,408 --> 00:01:21,191
Yeah,

29
00:01:21,217 --> 00:01:23,701
that was a particularly bad energy.

30
00:01:30,988 --> 00:01:33,823
And it isn't just energy
of other people's things.

31
00:01:34,075 --> 00:01:35,683
Other people's behavior,

32
00:01:35,826 --> 00:01:38,031
that comes floating back to me at times.

33
00:01:44,007 --> 00:01:45,500
What?! What?
What is it?!

34
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:48,451
The trick, I learned,
is to try to figure out why,

35
00:01:48,696 --> 00:01:51,091
the object is sharing
that energy with you.

36
00:01:51,477 --> 00:01:53,113
What the message might be.

37
00:01:53,357 --> 00:01:54,410
And then,

38
00:01:55,085 --> 00:01:56,330
hopefully,

39
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:58,972
behave accordingly.

40
00:02:52,487 --> 00:02:53,632
You okay?

41
00:02:54,325 --> 00:02:55,962
It's 03:15 in the morning.

42
00:02:56,627 --> 00:02:59,591
It's never God's plan for people
to be up at 3:15 in the morning.

43
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:00,812
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:00,858 --> 00:03:04,062
I want to clean up the blood and
open the road before the morning rush.

45
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,413
I knew you'd want to see it all
before they carted it away.

46
00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:11,543
You sure she wasn't drunk?

47
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:13,631
She was heading east around 11:20.

48
00:03:13,658 --> 00:03:16,692
Light trafic, looks like
she was going between 20 and 30.

49
00:03:19,415 --> 00:03:21,280
One in the head, two in the chest.

50
00:03:22,466 --> 00:03:24,363
I don't think she even
knew what hit her.

51
00:03:24,767 --> 00:03:26,910
Somebody shoot her
from a passing car?

52
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,433
I guess someone was up
on that walkway, there.

53
00:03:30,988 --> 00:03:33,513
What do you mean?
That's half a football field away.

54
00:03:35,835 --> 00:03:37,042
You're saying we have a...

55
00:03:37,228 --> 00:03:39,052
...highway sniper
and nobody saw him?

56
00:03:42,846 --> 00:03:44,542
So, how old are you Daddy?

57
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:47,281
I'm old, kiddo.
I'm really old.

58
00:03:47,306 --> 00:03:48,470
No your not.

59
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:50,160
Mommy, I don't understand.

60
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:52,522
Why can't Daddy open
his birthday presents <i>now</i>?

61
00:03:52,548 --> 00:03:53,950
'Cause that's not how we do it.

62
00:03:53,976 --> 00:03:55,961
We don't offer birthday presents
in the morning.

63
00:03:55,988 --> 00:03:57,302
We do on Christmass.

64
00:03:57,338 --> 00:03:59,870
Yeah, this isn't Christmass,
this is Daddy's birthday.

65
00:03:59,895 --> 00:04:01,921
Have you ever seen anyone
put a birthday candle

66
00:04:01,945 --> 00:04:03,580
in a ball of breakfeast cereals?

67
00:04:03,615 --> 00:04:05,561
No. You want to know why?

68
00:04:05,815 --> 00:04:08,353
'Cause we don't open birthday presents
in the morning.

69
00:04:08,605 --> 00:04:11,020
Let me let you in
a little secret, Bridge.

70
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:14,271
I think it's really 'cause Mommy
likes to procrastinate.

71
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:16,382
Really?
What's that?

72
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:19,303
When someone puts on doing things
that they really need to do.

73
00:04:19,356 --> 00:04:20,703
P recisely.

74
00:04:20,926 --> 00:04:23,861
I think the real reason
I can't open my presents,

75
00:04:24,528 --> 00:04:28,161
Is because Mommy has not actually
gone around and getting me one yet.

76
00:04:28,317 --> 00:04:29,291
Thank you.

77
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:31,131
Thank you very much.

78
00:04:35,488 --> 00:04:37,430
- Good morning.
- Hi, uh...

79
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:39,850
Do you have the add
that ran this morning's paper?

80
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:41,122
Oh, sure.

81
00:04:45,725 --> 00:04:47,621
Anything I can help you with in there?

82
00:04:47,906 --> 00:04:49,401
I'm interested in this.

83
00:04:49,607 --> 00:04:51,740
It's a great machine,
would you like to see one?

84
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:52,752
- Sure.
- Yep.

85
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,593
It says to ask about pricing.

86
00:04:55,617 --> 00:04:56,412
1099.

87
00:04:56,548 --> 00:04:57,983
1100 dollars.

88
00:04:58,015 --> 00:05:01,073
And believe it or not,
our competitors have 'em for 3049.

89
00:05:02,015 --> 00:05:03,741
Not which you had budgeted..

90
00:05:04,928 --> 00:05:06,541
What were you
looking to spend?

91
00:05:06,808 --> 00:05:08,793
Half of that, or less.

92
00:05:10,446 --> 00:05:11,441
This...

93
00:05:11,658 --> 00:05:14,050
is a 1200 $ camera too, but....

94
00:05:14,226 --> 00:05:15,591
far superior

95
00:05:15,635 --> 00:05:17,550
to the one you wanted to buy.

96
00:05:18,936 --> 00:05:22,110
It comes specially equiped
with a 12:1 zoom lens,

97
00:05:22,165 --> 00:05:23,802
that's like having a...

98
00:05:24,036 --> 00:05:25,971
video camera on the end of a telescope.

99
00:05:26,487 --> 00:05:28,531
It's excellent in low-light situations,

100
00:05:28,768 --> 00:05:29,920
this is the...

101
00:05:30,126 --> 00:05:32,450
Rolls-Royce of video cameras.

102
00:05:32,937 --> 00:05:34,821
I let you have it for 500 dollars.

103
00:05:38,235 --> 00:05:40,010
Okay, why would you do that?

104
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:44,040
Everyone of these that I sell,
comes right back to the store.

105
00:05:44,096 --> 00:05:46,340
It's an excellent
piece of gear, it's just...

106
00:05:46,627 --> 00:05:49,592
too damn complicated for your
average point-'n-shoot customer.

107
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:52,922
And nobody wants to read the
operating manual anymore, you know?

108
00:05:53,315 --> 00:05:55,690
We were just gonna sent it back
to the manufacturer, and...

109
00:05:55,715 --> 00:05:58,113
frankly I would much rather
sell it to you,

110
00:05:58,137 --> 00:05:59,843
hopefully make a new customer,

111
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:02,181
and saves money on shipping.

112
00:06:03,828 --> 00:06:05,161
Let me run to the back,

113
00:06:05,187 --> 00:06:07,341
take a battery, a blank DVD
and let you play.

114
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:16,240
< i>Hello...</i>

115
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:18,360
<i>Wow, face the camera, sweetie.</i>

116
00:06:19,205 --> 00:06:21,071
<i>Yeah... thank you.</i>

117
00:06:21,917 --> 00:06:23,063
<i>So...</i>

118
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:24,920
<i>Roll over.</i>

119
00:06:25,157 --> 00:06:26,921
<i>Come on, you want to.
You want to do it.</i>

120
00:06:26,948 --> 00:06:28,151
<i>You wanna roll over.</i>

121
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:29,423
<i>- Thank you...
- Hey you!</i>

122
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:32,363
<i>Camera guy, I'm talking to you.</i>

123
00:06:33,997 --> 00:06:35,851
<i>What's you do here camera guy?</i>

124
00:06:37,017 --> 00:06:39,442
<i>What do y-- W-what do you mean?</i>

125
00:06:40,678 --> 00:06:42,073
<i>What do I mean?</i>

126
00:06:42,215 --> 00:06:43,763
<i>What do you think I mean?</i>

127
00:06:43,997 --> 00:06:46,481
<i>I mean, I've been coming to this park 
for 3 days in a row,</i>

128
00:06:46,495 --> 00:06:49,503
<i>and for 3 days in a row I've seen
you trying to take pictures of me.</i>

129
00:06:49,846 --> 00:06:51,301
<i>I don't like it.</i>

130
00:06:54,255 --> 00:06:56,551
<i>Okay, so what?
Now you have nothing to say?</i>

131
00:06:58,648 --> 00:07:00,111
<i>What's your name?</i>

132
00:07:00,656 --> 00:07:02,760
<i>I'm thinking your name must be Dick.</i>

133
00:07:03,077 --> 00:07:04,763
<i>Do you mind if I call you Dick?</i>

134
00:07:04,775 --> 00:07:05,661
<i>Dick.</i>

135
00:07:07,768 --> 00:07:09,872
<i>Big, brave guy, with a camera.</i>

136
00:07:10,927 --> 00:07:12,292
<i>Go ahead, Dick</i>

137
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:14,041
<i>Tilt  down.</i>

138
00:07:15,136 --> 00:07:16,682
<i>I know you want to.</i>

139
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:21,011
<i>Tilt... down,</i>

140
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:22,940
<i>Dick</i>

141
00:07:31,898 --> 00:07:33,330
<i>Allright, that's enough.</i>

142
00:07:34,636 --> 00:07:36,473
<i>Now,</i>
<i>You got what you needed?</i>

143
00:07:36,778 --> 00:07:38,270
<i>- I'm out of here.
- Oh, Miss!</i>

144
00:07:38,303 --> 00:07:39,617
<i>Wait Miss, don't go!</i>

145
00:07:39,658 --> 00:07:41,516
Ready to play?

146
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,210
How does it feel to you?

147
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:46,622
It's small, light, it's terrific, right?

148
00:07:46,857 --> 00:07:48,573
Just wait till I put this battery in,

149
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:50,522
power it up, so you'd see
what it really can do.

150
00:07:50,548 --> 00:07:52,631
Ok but I think there might
already be one in there.

151
00:07:52,648 --> 00:07:54,211
No, actually it's impossible,

152
00:07:54,238 --> 00:07:56,783
you can't put the DVD in
until you put the battery in.

153
00:07:56,806 --> 00:07:58,461
And I just put the battery in,

154
00:07:58,785 --> 00:07:59,983
Go ahead.

155
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:09,740
I'll take it.

156
00:08:20,397 --> 00:08:22,552
<i>Cathy come on, I haven't got all day
Get in there.</i>

157
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,533
<i>I'm using up the battery!</i>

158
00:08:25,317 --> 00:08:27,450
<i>I can't keep photographing an empty bed.</i>

159
00:08:28,227 --> 00:08:29,370
<i>Cathy.</i>

160
00:08:30,408 --> 00:08:31,502
<i>Get in there!<i>

161
00:08:31,566 --> 00:08:32,403
<i>No.</i>

162
00:08:32,405 --> 00:08:34,231
<i>Get in there, I'm using up the battery!</i>

163
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:36,560
<i>Oh, you are so</i>

164
00:08:36,597 --> 00:08:38,541
<i>predictable at this video thing.</i>

165
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:40,143
<i>And what does that mean?</i>

166
00:08:40,176 --> 00:08:42,213
<i>What do you think it means? It means...</i>

167
00:08:42,336 --> 00:08:44,301
<i>It's just good for you
to be predictable.</i>

168
00:08:44,346 --> 00:08:46,740
<i>You are completely predictable.</i>

169
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:49,573
<i>Does that mean...
that you don't love me anymore?</i>

170
00:08:51,807 --> 00:08:53,602
<i>It means...</i>

171
00:08:54,815 --> 00:08:57,522
<i>that I'd better be the only one
that you videotape.</i>

172
00:08:58,598 --> 00:09:00,780
<i>From now and 'til the end of time.</i>

173
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,471
<i>That's what I mean, camera guy.</i>

174
00:09:03,716 --> 00:09:04,992
<i>And what else?</i>

175
00:09:06,008 --> 00:09:08,033
<i>It means...</i>

176
00:09:09,468 --> 00:09:10,970
<i>Cathy loves Travis.</i>

177
00:09:11,027 --> 00:09:12,782
<i>-Louder.
- Cathy loves Travis.</i>

178
00:09:12,806 --> 00:09:14,283
<i>Tell it louder!</i>

179
00:09:14,946 --> 00:09:15,950
Allison?

180
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,003
You're busy?

181
00:09:18,406 --> 00:09:21,510
Just a birthday present for Joe.
Just wrapping in.

182
00:09:22,446 --> 00:09:24,821
Well, we're all summoned
to the conference room,

183
00:09:24,846 --> 00:09:26,121
I know not why.

184
00:09:26,627 --> 00:09:28,322
Maggie played cards at the club.

185
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:30,581
Every Wednesday night, 8:45.

186
00:09:32,847 --> 00:09:35,171
Game ended at 11, It had to.

187
00:09:35,268 --> 00:09:37,090
That's when they closed the room.

188
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:41,123
She was always home by 11:25

189
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:45,471
On 30, I call her cell phone.
It goes straight to voice mail,

190
00:09:45,498 --> 00:09:47,093
I thought - "okay,

191
00:09:47,205 --> 00:09:49,510
she forgot to put
the damn thing on."

192
00:09:49,897 --> 00:09:51,152
By quarter to 12,

193
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,702
I start to get anxious.

194
00:09:52,798 --> 00:09:55,732
So I call the other girls--
Camille, Lorraine, Rhonda.
They're all home.

195
00:09:56,455 --> 00:09:57,621
I don't know

196
00:09:57,717 --> 00:09:59,361
what
else to do, so I keep

197
00:09:59,456 --> 00:10:00,952
calling the cell phone.

198
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:01,962
And then

199
00:10:02,058 --> 00:10:04,393
I call the police.
No help.

200
00:10:05,195 --> 00:10:06,503
No offense.

201
00:10:07,028 --> 00:10:08,103
So...

202
00:10:08,717 --> 00:10:10,533
tried her cell again.

203
00:10:11,727 --> 00:10:13,123
And this time,

204
00:10:13,595 --> 00:10:15,930
I got
an EMS guy who answered.

205
00:10:24,387 --> 00:10:25,513
I met Mr. Caffey

206
00:10:25,607 --> 00:10:27,760
when
he came in this morning
to identify his wife.

207
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:30,980
I assured him
that we're doing
everything we can

208
00:10:31,027 --> 00:10:32,221
to find

209
00:10:32,318 --> 00:10:34,132
this animal.

210
00:10:37,115 --> 00:10:39,373
We all drive the same streets.

211
00:10:41,388 --> 00:10:42,742
Our loved ones

212
00:10:43,357 --> 00:10:45,320
all drive the same streets.

213
00:10:46,726 --> 00:10:48,741
Oh, how do I smell?

214
00:10:48,887 --> 00:10:50,570
Like the cool mist of the ocean.

215
00:10:50,626 --> 00:10:52,763
Hmm, just like the box says.

216
00:10:52,816 --> 00:10:53,900
Thank you, honey.

217
00:10:53,996 --> 00:10:56,053
- Happy birthday, Daddy.
- Thank you, sweetie.

218
00:10:56,106 --> 00:10:58,061
Open mine!
Open mine!

219
00:10:58,215 --> 00:11:00,852
Wow, is this for me?

220
00:11:01,358 --> 00:11:05,000
- Is it a car?
- No, and you did that joke last year.

221
00:11:05,055 --> 00:11:08,610
He does that joke every year.
That's how we know he's a year older.

222
00:11:09,595 --> 00:11:11,193
It's beautiful.

223
00:11:11,248 --> 00:11:12,931
- I made it.
- You're kidding.

224
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:14,333
Do you know what it is?

225
00:11:14,385 --> 00:11:16,440
Yes I do, but I'm not going to tell you.

226
00:11:16,535 --> 00:11:18,653
She thinks it's an ashtray.

227
00:11:18,748 --> 00:11:20,562
That is so otherworldly.

228
00:11:20,665 --> 00:11:22,623
This is so what I was hoping for.

229
00:11:22,956 --> 00:11:24,140
You don't even smoke.

230
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:26,511
And I never will,
but I can still appreciate

231
00:11:26,616 --> 00:11:28,612
a beautifully made ashtray.

232
00:11:29,236 --> 00:11:30,450
Thank you, honey.

233
00:11:30,548 --> 00:11:33,490
I am going to put this
on my desk at work,

234
00:11:33,595 --> 00:11:35,512
right next to the one
you gave me last year.

235
00:11:35,706 --> 00:11:37,571
Here's a little something
from me and Marie.

236
00:11:37,628 --> 00:11:39,260
Also not a car.

237
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:44,173
You shouldn't have.

238
00:11:44,266 --> 00:11:45,992
Oh, my.

239
00:11:46,496 --> 00:11:48,550
Oh, come on.

240
00:11:48,656 --> 00:11:50,481
Oh, wow, look at this.

241
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:51,550
Awesome!

242
00:11:51,616 --> 00:11:55,490
Now this is even better than
the one that I showed you in the paper.

243
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,443
Wow, this one has all
the bells and whistles.

244
00:11:58,545 --> 00:12:00,273
Don't look at me.
Marie picked it out.

245
00:12:00,365 --> 00:12:04,822
Whoa. I can't even imagine
how much this cost.

246
00:12:05,715 --> 00:12:08,520
So which of the girls
isn't going to college?

247
00:12:09,585 --> 00:12:11,093
Where is...?

248
00:12:15,017 --> 00:12:16,872
Well, that's it.
There's no bonus gift.

249
00:12:16,886 --> 00:12:19,100
I'm not looking for a bonus gift.

250
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,722
You outdid yourself.
And you, too!

251
00:12:21,817 --> 00:12:24,062
Oh, how did you know?

252
00:12:27,695 --> 00:12:30,210
No, I just thought
that maybe they included

253
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,753
a blank DVD for you to record on.

254
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:35,372
you're kidding?
There's nothing to record on in there?

255
00:12:35,406 --> 00:12:37,523
- I didn't even think to ask.
- That doesn't matter.

256
00:12:37,545 --> 00:12:39,473
I can wait to record
something till tomorrow.

257
00:12:39,518 --> 00:12:41,410
This is clearly an amazing camera.

258
00:12:41,457 --> 00:12:43,840
I got me some amazing cologne

259
00:12:43,945 --> 00:12:45,853
and an amazing ashtray.

260
00:12:46,007 --> 00:12:48,811
And an amazing little
raspberry right here.

261
00:12:49,097 --> 00:12:52,001
Sorry about the DVDs.
I'll grab some tomorrow.

262
00:12:52,526 --> 00:12:54,063
It was a great birthday.

263
00:12:55,527 --> 00:12:56,573
Really?

264
00:12:57,638 --> 00:12:59,290
I'm glad.

265
00:12:59,935 --> 00:13:02,242
I'm so glad you thought so.

266
00:13:03,338 --> 00:13:06,370
I was worried you would think
I didn't put enough thought into it.

267
00:13:09,558 --> 00:13:11,060
I always think,

268
00:13:11,628 --> 00:13:13,161
"This year I'll be different.

269
00:13:15,186 --> 00:13:18,373
"This year I'll whisk him off his feet,

270
00:13:19,635 --> 00:13:21,512
"take him to the pyramids,

271
00:13:22,358 --> 00:13:23,850
"buy him box seats

272
00:13:23,908 --> 00:13:26,530
"for some great sports
team or something.

273
00:13:27,826 --> 00:13:30,170
Make him a gourmet meal."

274
00:13:33,495 --> 00:13:34,433
And then

275
00:13:34,487 --> 00:13:36,683
I run around the day of

276
00:13:37,947 --> 00:13:41,373
getting your present,
making you a cake from a mix...

277
00:13:43,476 --> 00:13:44,790
worrying 

278
00:13:45,315 --> 00:13:47,321
that you'll think I don't care.

279
00:13:51,405 --> 00:13:53,093
I was driving home tonight,

280
00:13:54,878 --> 00:13:56,462
the sun had already set,

281
00:13:58,006 --> 00:13:59,882
and every building that I passed,

282
00:14:00,598 --> 00:14:02,082
every bridge

283
00:14:02,606 --> 00:14:04,330
every water tower,

284
00:14:05,797 --> 00:14:07,521
I was thinking,

285
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,330
"Is he there?"

286
00:14:12,445 --> 00:14:14,310
And  you could just feel that

287
00:14:14,506 --> 00:14:16,293
every person

288
00:14:16,477 --> 00:14:19,382
and every car around me,
they were thinking the same thing:

289
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:21,253
"Is he out there?

290
00:14:22,948 --> 00:14:25,390
Is he thinking about
shooting at my car?"

291
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:27,961
At me.

292
00:14:29,655 --> 00:14:31,991
Doesn't he know it's my birthday? 

293
00:14:34,288 --> 00:14:36,442
Doesn't he know I have to get home

294
00:14:36,957 --> 00:14:39,442
so Bridgette can give me her ashtray?

295
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,690
<i>Come on, baby,
get up there.</i>

296
00:15:26,858 --> 00:15:28,610
<i>No, Travis,
I don't want to.</i>

297
00:15:28,815 --> 00:15:30,213
<i>Come on. It's just</i>

298
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:31,843
<i>you and me here.</i>

299
00:15:32,388 --> 00:15:34,170
<i>I want to see you
on camera.</i>

300
00:15:34,847 --> 00:15:36,570
<i>It's  too embarrassing.</i>

301
00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:38,962
<i>I don't want anyone
to see this online.</i>

302
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,132
<i>Kathy,</i>

303
00:15:41,606 --> 00:15:43,280
<i>don't you
trust me, baby?</i>

304
00:15:43,908 --> 00:15:45,900
<i>If you really love me,
you'll do this for me.</i>

305
00:15:48,206 --> 00:15:49,033
<i>Travis,</i>

306
00:15:49,055 --> 00:15:51,770
<i>I don't want to do this, okay? </i>

307
00:15:52,075 --> 00:15:54,413
<i>Can you just get in there
so I have something to focus on?</i>

308
00:15:54,447 --> 00:15:56,173
<i>I've never used this
tripod thing before.</i>

309
00:16:02,355 --> 00:16:04,591
<i>Travis, did you hear me?
I don't want to do this,</i>

310
00:16:04,695 --> 00:16:05,861
<i>okay?</i>

311
00:16:06,288 --> 00:16:07,460
<i>I mean,</i>

312
00:16:08,026 --> 00:16:11,253
<i>I'll do this, I'll do anything,
but I don't want you to tape it, 'right?</i>

313
00:16:11,588 --> 00:16:14,440
<i>I'm not asking you to do anything
that I'm not gonna do.</i>

314
00:16:14,537 --> 00:16:15,610
<i>No,</i>

315
00:16:15,656 --> 00:16:17,363
<i>you shouldn't tape it, okay?
Not tonight.</i>

316
00:16:17,395 --> 00:16:19,033
<i>Why?
It's gonna be fun.</i>

317
00:16:19,598 --> 00:16:21,231
<i>Listen, nobody's gonna see it.</i>

318
00:16:21,287 --> 00:16:23,861
<i>I mean, you're beautiful, but...</i>

319
00:16:23,957 --> 00:16:25,973
<i>you're not famous.
I mean, no offense,</i>

320
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:28,343
<i>but you ain't exactly Paris Hilton,
I'm not Colin Farrell.</i>

321
00:16:28,408 --> 00:16:30,192
<i>Now give me something to focus on.</i>

322
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,053
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

323
00:16:50,575 --> 00:16:52,770
<i>I told you I didn't want to tape it.</i>

324
00:17:09,116 --> 00:17:10,763
<i>What are you showing me?</i>

325
00:17:13,537 --> 00:17:15,362
<i>He knows something's up.</i>

326
00:17:17,815 --> 00:17:19,812
<i>Last night, he came home,
said he couldn't</i>

327
00:17:19,896 --> 00:17:22,020
<i>reach me for hours.</i>

328
00:17:23,598 --> 00:17:25,540
<i>He beat the living crap out of me.</i>

329
00:17:28,518 --> 00:17:30,230
<i>No, don't.</i>

330
00:17:33,057 --> 00:17:35,362
<i>I told him I got a call, you know,</i>

331
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:39,280
<i>to do temp work at the V.A. Hospital,
but he didn't believe me.</i>

332
00:17:40,086 --> 00:17:41,520
<i>He said he could...</i>

333
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,441
<i>smell you on me.</i>

334
00:17:44,616 --> 00:17:46,090
<i>Not you, but someone.</i>

335
00:17:46,296 --> 00:17:47,822
<i>Said the next time</i>

336
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:49,430
<i>he'd kill me.</i>

337
00:17:50,926 --> 00:17:53,561
<i>Do it with drugs.
No one would ever know.</i>

338
00:17:56,925 --> 00:17:59,720
<i>Sometimes I lie in bed at night,</i>

339
00:18:02,016 --> 00:18:04,411
<i>I lie next to him and I think about...</i>

340
00:18:06,176 --> 00:18:08,371
<i>what my life would be like</i>

341
00:18:09,078 --> 00:18:10,822
<i>if he were gone...</i>

342
00:18:13,415 --> 00:18:15,113
<i>if he were dead.</i>

343
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,772
<i>Is it something you want?</i>

344
00:18:31,956 --> 00:18:34,472
<i>I can't let him hurt
you anymore, Kathy.</i>

345
00:18:40,608 --> 00:18:43,081
<i>Shouldn't you maybe shut off the tape?</i>

346
00:18:53,748 --> 00:18:55,273
Kathy and Travis.

347
00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:57,113
Any particular Kathy and Travis?

348
00:18:57,165 --> 00:18:59,460
I just know,
at least I strongly suspect

349
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:01,540
they're going to attempt
to kill her husband.

350
00:19:01,716 --> 00:19:03,702
He's a doctor, there must be
some way to research

351
00:19:03,728 --> 00:19:05,602
doctors with wives named "Kathy."

352
00:19:05,805 --> 00:19:08,050
- I'm pretty sure they're from this area.
- Why's that?

353
00:19:08,257 --> 00:19:11,402
I bought my husband a video camera
for his birthday from Archibald's.

354
00:19:11,575 --> 00:19:13,183
Before there were batteries in it,

355
00:19:13,216 --> 00:19:15,422
before there was anything to record on,

356
00:19:15,586 --> 00:19:17,023
I started to see videos

357
00:19:17,106 --> 00:19:18,983
of this couple on the viewfinder screen.

358
00:19:19,068 --> 00:19:20,661
Kathy and Travis?

359
00:19:21,266 --> 00:19:23,913
I think perhaps they owned
the camera before I did.

360
00:19:24,276 --> 00:19:27,272
I think the camera
remembers what it saw

361
00:19:27,425 --> 00:19:30,233
and it's showing it to me so we could
stop this thing from happening.

362
00:19:30,286 --> 00:19:33,171
It's showing you all this,
but it's not giving you last names.

363
00:19:33,376 --> 00:19:35,413
It's showing you all this,
but it's not telling you

364
00:19:35,446 --> 00:19:38,172
where or when this killing
might take place.

365
00:19:38,795 --> 00:19:41,753
Allison, maybe you haven't noticed,
but the city's come to a standstill.

366
00:19:41,887 --> 00:19:44,782
We're in the middle
of a bona fide crisis.

367
00:19:46,705 --> 00:19:47,622
Give me a name,

368
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,340
first and last.

369
00:19:49,477 --> 00:19:53,020
Better yet, buy a camera
that has videos of this madman

370
00:19:53,078 --> 00:19:55,752
who's using our streets
for target practice.

371
00:19:56,325 --> 00:19:58,283
That would be truly helpful.

372
00:20:02,348 --> 00:20:04,100
He loved it, right?

373
00:20:04,545 --> 00:20:06,941
Someone owned this camera
before I did, didn't they?

374
00:20:07,588 --> 00:20:09,852
You told me people were
bringing them back to the store,

375
00:20:09,878 --> 00:20:12,303
but you never explained
that someone actually used

376
00:20:12,328 --> 00:20:14,852
this specific camera
you sold me before I bought it.

377
00:20:14,877 --> 00:20:16,983
- Well, I don't know that to be true.
- Well, I do.

378
00:20:16,997 --> 00:20:18,840
I need the name
of the previous owner.

379
00:20:19,027 --> 00:20:20,503
Ma'am, I can assure you

380
00:20:20,658 --> 00:20:21,932
if by some chance

381
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,792
someone purchased the camera
before you and returned it to the store,

382
00:20:24,826 --> 00:20:27,412
it passed the most
rigorous of inspections

383
00:20:27,428 --> 00:20:29,292
before being
returned to inventory.

384
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,381
It's completely covered
by manufacturer's warranty.

385
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,293
I don't care about
the manufacturer's warranty.

386
00:20:33,305 --> 00:20:35,941
I just need the name of the
person who owned it before me.

387
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:38,930
Furthermore, as I offered
at time of purchase,

388
00:20:39,018 --> 00:20:40,692
I'd be happy to take the machine back,

389
00:20:40,778 --> 00:20:42,741
swap it out for an easier-to-use model.

390
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:44,702
His first name was Travis.
He had brown hair.

391
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:45,580
Ma'am,

392
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:48,913
I'm not saying that someone else
did buy your camera before you, but--

393
00:20:49,036 --> 00:20:51,551
if they did,
I still couldn'ttell you their name.

394
00:20:51,635 --> 00:20:53,673
I'm with the District Attorney's office.

395
00:20:53,758 --> 00:20:56,323
That's all well and good, but...

396
00:20:56,487 --> 00:20:59,162
You're gonna need
to speak to a manager.

397
00:20:59,247 --> 00:21:01,080
I mean, do you have
a warrant or something?

398
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,163
Did he not bring it back?
Did a girl bring it back?

399
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,350
Kathy-- brown hair, pretty?

400
00:21:05,817 --> 00:21:08,330
I don't get it.
Are you not happy with the camera?

401
00:21:13,878 --> 00:21:15,920
I need some recordable DVDs.

402
00:21:16,477 --> 00:21:17,553
Basically what the Mayor,

403
00:21:17,575 --> 00:21:19,443
and the City Attorney
want you to weigh in on

404
00:21:19,648 --> 00:21:22,042
Is if we assign
a disproportionate share

405
00:21:22,098 --> 00:21:24,930
of police to monitor the neighborhoods
where the wealthy people live--

406
00:21:25,105 --> 00:21:28,533
what's our exposure if our sniper friend
shoots someone in a poor neighborhood

407
00:21:28,565 --> 00:21:30,941
and their family
decides to sue the city.

408
00:21:31,907 --> 00:21:35,270
Want to hear a scary thought?
Which is also a great thought?

409
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,590
- What if he never shoots again?
- What's scary about that?

410
00:21:38,946 --> 00:21:40,290
Between you and me?

411
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,233
If he doesn't make
another try I don't think

412
00:21:42,266 --> 00:21:44,630
there's a lot of hope
we're ever going to catch him.

413
00:21:44,677 --> 00:21:47,060
The evidence he left behind
the other night

414
00:21:47,408 --> 00:21:49,612
isn't leading us anywhere.

415
00:21:53,177 --> 00:21:55,051
On the other hand,
I suppose I'd rather have

416
00:21:55,136 --> 00:21:58,780
one unsolved murder than two
or three or four or five.

417
00:21:58,807 --> 00:22:00,563
Hell, I'd rather have
one unsolved murder

418
00:22:00,575 --> 00:22:02,460
then two or three solved ones.

419
00:22:02,505 --> 00:22:05,320
I just invited Sean Caffey back
down here for a little conversation.

420
00:22:05,356 --> 00:22:08,201
Thought you might want to listen in
from the other side of the glass...

421
00:22:08,277 --> 00:22:10,921
You're having a conversation
with him in the interrogation room?

422
00:22:10,978 --> 00:22:14,961
That's a hell of a way to treat a widower
two days after his wife is shot to death.

423
00:22:15,325 --> 00:22:16,600
Maybe.

424
00:22:16,927 --> 00:22:20,543
Apparently there was trouble in the marriage,
but there was also a solid prenup in place.

425
00:22:20,617 --> 00:22:22,131
In the event of divorce,

426
00:22:22,218 --> 00:22:23,860
Sean would get nothing.

427
00:22:23,987 --> 00:22:25,780
How much is she worth to him dead?

428
00:22:25,868 --> 00:22:28,983
Between the inheritance and
insurance pay outs, about 30 millions.

429
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:33,070
So he bought himself
a long-range rifle,

430
00:22:33,297 --> 00:22:35,210
got up on that pedestrian bridge

431
00:22:35,298 --> 00:22:37,703
and, boy, talk about a lucky shot.

432
00:22:37,786 --> 00:22:38,942
He's rich.

433
00:22:38,986 --> 00:22:40,663
They hire people to do
their dirty work.

434
00:22:40,787 --> 00:22:42,463
Sounds improbable, but...

435
00:22:43,286 --> 00:22:44,632
not impossible.

436
00:22:44,677 --> 00:22:47,052
And as it happens
we're suffering from...

437
00:22:47,368 --> 00:22:49,752
an acute shortage of leads
in this particular case, so yeah,

438
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:51,761
sure.
I'll come with you.

439
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:54,643
- I'll pass.
- It's okay.

440
00:22:54,726 --> 00:22:56,441
You weren't invited.

441
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:02,652
Just an errand.

442
00:23:02,688 --> 00:23:05,152
Now that you're back,
want to be my date for an interrogation?

443
00:23:05,168 --> 00:23:06,892
I suppose.

444
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,502
Where did you get these?

445
00:23:12,188 --> 00:23:14,463
Your wife hired a private detective.

446
00:23:15,665 --> 00:23:18,313
Were you aware that she was
contemplating divorce?

447
00:23:19,605 --> 00:23:21,273
These photos are over a year old.

448
00:23:21,306 --> 00:23:23,763
Maggie and I were working things out.
I don't understand.

449
00:23:23,845 --> 00:23:25,880
<i>How is this relevant to anything?</i>

450
00:23:25,907 --> 00:23:28,131
<i>Shouldn't you be out there
looking for a man with a gun?</i>

451
00:23:28,145 --> 00:23:30,190
<i>I don't know, we're not sure
who we should be looking for.</i>

452
00:23:30,207 --> 00:23:31,862
That's why we're having
this conversation.

453
00:23:31,885 --> 00:23:34,613
- Should I be calling my lawyer?
- You have a lawyer?

454
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,672
Of your own?

455
00:23:35,718 --> 00:23:37,961
<i>Because your late wife's family
made it very clear to me</i>

456
00:23:37,965 --> 00:23:41,220
<i>the family attorney had no interest in
helping you with this particular matter.</i>

457
00:23:41,345 --> 00:23:42,953
What do you make of him?

458
00:23:44,315 --> 00:23:46,833
I feel really stupid, really useless.

459
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:50,190
It's as if I'm not even
tuned in to the same channel.

460
00:23:50,525 --> 00:23:52,133
Everything I see in my head

461
00:23:52,135 --> 00:23:54,731
has to do with those two kids
I told you about this morning.

462
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,930
And their plan to kill her husband.

463
00:23:57,576 --> 00:23:59,732
So talk to me about being a player.

464
00:24:01,976 --> 00:24:03,732
How does that work?

465
00:24:05,105 --> 00:24:06,122
I mean,

466
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:09,300
you marry a really wealthy woman,
she makes you sign a prenup,

467
00:24:09,505 --> 00:24:11,990
and then what is it?
You just can't be faithful?

468
00:24:12,595 --> 00:24:15,193
Because from a monetary standpoint,
it makes no sense.

469
00:24:15,237 --> 00:24:17,360
You're really playing with fire.

470
00:24:17,906 --> 00:24:19,882
Unless of course,
you can make absolutely certain

471
00:24:19,898 --> 00:24:22,480
that she won't divorce you,
can't divorce you,

472
00:24:22,688 --> 00:24:24,182
isn't alive to divorce you.

473
00:24:24,658 --> 00:24:26,450
I loved my wife.

474
00:24:26,538 --> 00:24:30,012
Where were you between 11 and 11:45
on the night your wife was slain?

475
00:24:30,098 --> 00:24:32,120
I've made no secret of where I was.

476
00:24:32,298 --> 00:24:34,423
<i>I was at home,
trying to contact her.</i>

477
00:24:34,497 --> 00:24:36,063
<i>Then why didn't you
use the home phone?</i>

478
00:24:36,077 --> 00:24:38,003
Why'd you keep
calling her from your cell phone?

479
00:24:38,026 --> 00:24:39,083
Because I was lazy.

480
00:24:39,106 --> 00:24:41,341
Because I had her mobile number
programmed into my cell.

481
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:43,912
Because if I use the regular
phones at home I had to dial it,

482
00:24:43,945 --> 00:24:47,273
but if I used my cell phone
I just had to press one button.

483
00:24:48,117 --> 00:24:50,003
Do you think I don't know
how bad this sounds?

484
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:52,323
The answer to all
your questions is "yes."

485
00:24:52,405 --> 00:24:54,601
Yes, I do think you
know how bad this sounds,

486
00:24:54,728 --> 00:24:56,611
<i>yes you do need a lawyer</i>

487
00:24:56,658 --> 00:24:58,621
<i>And yes,</i>
<i>I know you didn't ask,</i>

488
00:24:58,628 --> 00:25:01,692
<i>but I do believe you're going to be
spending the night with us, Mr. Caffey.</i>

489
00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:06,460
I wonder who lives in here.

490
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,112
Daddy.

491
00:25:10,198 --> 00:25:12,190
I'm making a documentary

492
00:25:12,266 --> 00:25:15,823
on the nocturnal habits
of eighth graders.

493
00:25:15,855 --> 00:25:18,840
Explain to our viewers at home
what it is you're doing right now.

494
00:25:18,888 --> 00:25:21,843
I'm doing geometry.
And it's stupid.

495
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:24,733
This is fascinating.
I know I'm riveted.

496
00:25:25,976 --> 00:25:29,462
My name is Bridgette Dubois
and I shall now

497
00:25:29,548 --> 00:25:31,541
dance with a spoon

498
00:25:32,108 --> 00:25:33,260
on my...

499
00:25:34,148 --> 00:25:35,861
on my nose.

500
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,961
Goaway!

501
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:47,800
- Honey...
- Goaway!

502
00:25:47,828 --> 00:25:50,310
Honey, smile.
This is Daddy's birthday present

503
00:25:50,377 --> 00:25:52,651
- and I need you to smile...
- Goaway!

504
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:54,810
I think she wants you to go away.

505
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:57,370
I bet you can't guess

506
00:25:57,376 --> 00:25:59,682
who the only two people
in this family are

507
00:25:59,776 --> 00:26:03,131
who haven't been
captured on DVD yet?

508
00:26:03,697 --> 00:26:05,012
Let me think about it.

509
00:26:07,235 --> 00:26:08,372
Time's up.

510
00:26:08,797 --> 00:26:10,993
What was that question again?

511
00:26:13,955 --> 00:26:16,993
Um, I... Are you forgetting
that yesterday was my birthday?

512
00:26:17,967 --> 00:26:21,692
Exactly.
So ask me again in 365 days.

513
00:26:23,736 --> 00:26:25,091
Hmm. Sorry, fella.

514
00:26:25,576 --> 00:26:28,130
I guess your work here
for tonight is through.

515
00:26:28,665 --> 00:26:30,860
I'm going to go
lock the door.

516
00:26:31,546 --> 00:26:33,472
And then I'm going
to go brush my teeth.

517
00:26:34,856 --> 00:26:36,140
No.

518
00:26:36,307 --> 00:26:38,393
Don't waste your time.

519
00:26:38,517 --> 00:26:40,121
I told you nothing's going to happen.

520
00:26:40,196 --> 00:26:42,322
Hardy-har, har, har.

521
00:27:12,766 --> 00:27:14,242
<i>So what am I looking for?</i>

522
00:27:14,737 --> 00:27:17,180
<i>A Mercedes.
It'll be coming towards you.</i>

523
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:19,942
<i>It's 11 after 11,
so it should be any minute now.</i>

524
00:27:20,608 --> 00:27:22,692
<i>He plays cards
every Wednesday at his club.</i>

525
00:27:22,916 --> 00:27:24,780
<i>They close the place at 11:00.</i>

526
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:28,402
<i>There's one.</i>

527
00:27:28,645 --> 00:27:30,082
<i>I'm pretty sure there's one.</i>

528
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:31,750
<i>Yeah. That's it.</i>

529
00:27:31,797 --> 00:27:33,622
<i>- I can tell from here.
- You sure?</i>

530
00:27:33,665 --> 00:27:35,432
<i>I'm absolutely sure.</i>

531
00:27:35,858 --> 00:27:37,002
<i>That's him.</i>

532
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:42,710
<i>Bang.</i>

533
00:27:43,457 --> 00:27:45,470
<i>Too bad this camera
doesn't have bullets.</i>

534
00:27:46,647 --> 00:27:48,273
<i>- That was a joke.
- I know.</i>

535
00:27:48,325 --> 00:27:50,363
<i>- Next week.
-I know.</i>

536
00:27:54,596 --> 00:27:55,483
So....

537
00:27:55,527 --> 00:27:57,600
you're telling me you believe
these two lovers

538
00:27:57,628 --> 00:27:59,541
- you've been talking about-
- Kathy and Travis.

539
00:27:59,555 --> 00:28:01,863
...were trying to kill
Kathy's husband,

540
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:05,582
but shot Sean Caffey's
wife by mistake?

541
00:28:09,336 --> 00:28:12,543
Well, it would certainly
simplify things if it were true.

542
00:28:12,628 --> 00:28:13,863
What do you mean?

543
00:28:13,948 --> 00:28:17,193
I mean, what a relief if we're no longer
dealing with a homicidal maniac

544
00:28:17,236 --> 00:28:19,172
who's bent on shooting
people at random,

545
00:28:19,215 --> 00:28:21,332
but rather a single
act of passion.

546
00:28:22,296 --> 00:28:24,771
Of course, you don't know Kathy
and Travis' last name.

547
00:28:24,857 --> 00:28:28,423
So it's not like we can track
these people down, check this story out.

548
00:28:28,548 --> 00:28:29,780
Well, that's the thing--

549
00:28:29,868 --> 00:28:31,903
when I saw them
rehearsing to kill this man,

550
00:28:32,066 --> 00:28:34,711
the wife, Kathy, kept talking
about this card game.

551
00:28:35,115 --> 00:28:36,832
How it had to end at 11:00.

552
00:28:36,898 --> 00:28:38,513
Sounded like the same card game

553
00:28:38,547 --> 00:28:41,061
at the same club that
Sean Caffey was talking about.

554
00:28:41,698 --> 00:28:44,181
- What's your point?
- Am I being naive, or...

555
00:28:44,425 --> 00:28:48,102
isn't it as simple as going to this club
and asking them if they have a member

556
00:28:48,148 --> 00:28:50,622
named Kathy
who's married to a doctor?

557
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:54,992
Anything to help solve
Mrs. Caffey's murder.

558
00:28:55,238 --> 00:28:57,232
Everyone around
here's devastated,

559
00:28:57,538 --> 00:28:59,071
as you can imagine.

560
00:28:59,356 --> 00:29:02,151
We're actually interested in talking
to some people we think may have

561
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:04,361
important information
about the killing.

562
00:29:04,607 --> 00:29:06,740
People we believe to be
members of the club here.

563
00:29:06,905 --> 00:29:09,222
They're a couple.
The husband's a doctor.

564
00:29:09,428 --> 00:29:12,432
Drives a car very similar
to the one Mrs. Caffey drove--

565
00:29:12,597 --> 00:29:14,503
expensive black sedan.

566
00:29:14,756 --> 00:29:18,433
A lot of the gentlemen here
drive expensive black sedans.

567
00:29:18,517 --> 00:29:21,721
And any number of our
members are physicians.

568
00:29:22,126 --> 00:29:23,913
Can you tell me anything
else about him?

569
00:29:23,935 --> 00:29:26,321
He plays cards here
on wednesdays at the club.

570
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:28,970
His wife is named Kathy.

571
00:29:29,045 --> 00:29:30,982
She has brown hair, maybe 25.

572
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:32,823
Mrs. Dubois,

573
00:29:32,848 --> 00:29:35,292
I have been at this club
for almost  25 years.

574
00:29:35,438 --> 00:29:37,201
I know every member personally.

575
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:39,683
And the only female
member named Kathy

576
00:29:39,767 --> 00:29:41,921
is a 63-year-old divorcee.

577
00:29:45,015 --> 00:29:46,891
Okay, so much for Kathy.

578
00:29:47,866 --> 00:29:49,742
Would it be possible to
get our hands on a list

579
00:29:49,745 --> 00:29:51,941
of the gentlemen who played
cards here last wednesday?

580
00:29:51,988 --> 00:29:54,272
Maybe the Wednesday
before that as well?

581
00:29:54,606 --> 00:29:55,710
I'm sorry,

582
00:29:55,796 --> 00:29:57,470
but there is no list.

583
00:29:57,567 --> 00:29:59,221
Wednesday is ladies only.

584
00:29:59,268 --> 00:30:01,072
Has been for as long as
I've been here.

585
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:05,273
If there's nothing else for the moment,

586
00:30:05,355 --> 00:30:07,833
we have a lunch on,
I really need to look in on.

587
00:30:08,727 --> 00:30:10,563
Of course.
We appreciate your help.

588
00:30:10,928 --> 00:30:13,803
If you need me,
I'll be in the clubhouse.

589
00:30:15,277 --> 00:30:17,971
What brand was that camera?
I wanna make sure I don't get one of those.

590
00:30:17,988 --> 00:30:19,073
I'm sorry.

591
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:21,171
We should head back to the ranch.

592
00:30:24,605 --> 00:30:25,950
That's Kathy.

593
00:30:26,947 --> 00:30:28,510
What'd you say?

594
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,101
Excuse me, Miss.

595
00:30:30,237 --> 00:30:31,350
Waitress...

596
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:33,322
Sorry, were you calling me?

597
00:30:33,828 --> 00:30:36,283
What can I get for you?
Something to eat, something to drink?

598
00:30:36,396 --> 00:30:37,720
Diana.

599
00:30:39,928 --> 00:30:41,413
Do I know you?

600
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:44,630
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

601
00:30:44,665 --> 00:30:47,423
It's just from over there
you look so familiar.

602
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:51,670
Been here almost
a year and a half, so...

603
00:30:52,728 --> 00:30:54,471
Are you a member
or a guest, or...?

604
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:56,563
A guest, a visitor.

605
00:30:57,126 --> 00:30:58,481
Oh.
It's weird.

606
00:30:58,807 --> 00:31:00,332
Has that ever happened to you?

607
00:31:00,695 --> 00:31:02,330
No, I'm certain we've met.

608
00:31:02,698 --> 00:31:05,491
But your name wasn't Diana.

609
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:08,690
I think you were
with your husband.

610
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:12,203
Okay, if you say so.

611
00:31:12,708 --> 00:31:14,262
Only thing is,

612
00:31:14,348 --> 00:31:16,790
I'm single. So...

613
00:31:18,815 --> 00:31:20,510
Are you sure I can't
get you anything?

614
00:31:20,637 --> 00:31:22,480
No, I'm fine, thanks.

615
00:31:23,068 --> 00:31:25,070
Okay, well, call if you need me.

616
00:31:26,008 --> 00:31:26,833
Okay.

617
00:31:26,858 --> 00:31:28,482
Who's that?
What'd you have to say?

618
00:31:28,647 --> 00:31:29,963
Her?

619
00:31:30,986 --> 00:31:32,852
Nothing, nobody.

620
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:39,502
Sorry I'm late.

621
00:31:43,425 --> 00:31:46,033
Saved you some Chinese.

622
00:31:46,555 --> 00:31:47,793
Wow,

623
00:31:49,148 --> 00:31:51,753
Wow, someone had a bad day.

624
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,672
I wasted half a day
at the golf course

625
00:31:54,848 --> 00:31:56,282
for no reason at all.

626
00:31:56,365 --> 00:31:59,131
Questioned someone I had
no business questioning.

627
00:31:59,595 --> 00:32:01,201
By the time I got back to the office,

628
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:03,482
there were all these
meetings about a sniper

629
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:05,462
who seems to have
gone on vacation

630
00:32:12,587 --> 00:32:14,513
I want to take that thing back.

631
00:32:14,838 --> 00:32:16,593
What thing?
What are you talking about?

632
00:32:19,368 --> 00:32:20,671
Girls.

633
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:23,452
Are you through with that?

634
00:32:24,335 --> 00:32:25,822
What's going on?

635
00:32:25,846 --> 00:32:28,442
The camera, I want to take it back.
I'll get you a different one,

636
00:32:28,465 --> 00:32:29,821
but I want to take this one back.

637
00:32:29,945 --> 00:32:31,352
Why? I like it.

638
00:32:31,398 --> 00:32:33,792
Yeah, well, for what
it's worth, I like it, too.

639
00:32:33,877 --> 00:32:35,603
Is something the matter
with it, Mommy?

640
00:32:35,686 --> 00:32:36,870
Yeah, I think so.

641
00:32:36,995 --> 00:32:39,762
The guy who sold it to me
gave me a huge discount on it.

642
00:32:40,206 --> 00:32:42,830
Every night since I gave it to you
I watch you turn it off.

643
00:32:42,935 --> 00:32:46,352
Then I come out here in the middle of
the night, it's turned itself back on.

644
00:32:46,646 --> 00:32:48,642
I'm worried it's going
to catch fire or something.

645
00:32:48,818 --> 00:32:49,712
What?!

646
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:51,893
I'll get another one
a different one...

647
00:32:51,976 --> 00:32:53,131
I promise.

648
00:32:53,576 --> 00:32:55,343
Tomorrow. I promise.

649
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:07,513
I don't want to hear a peep.
You're going back.

650
00:33:15,295 --> 00:33:17,900
- You okay?
- Do you hear that?

651
00:33:19,515 --> 00:33:21,273
No, I don't hear anything.

652
00:33:21,947 --> 00:33:23,713
Go back to sleep.

653
00:33:31,937 --> 00:33:34,170
Doesn't anyone hear that but me?

654
00:34:16,247 --> 00:34:17,652
<i>It's open.</i>

655
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:25,173
<i>Can you turn
that thing off, honey?</i>

656
00:34:25,475 --> 00:34:27,080
<i>I'd really rather not.</i>

657
00:34:27,847 --> 00:34:29,862
<i>The first time I saw you
it was through this thing.</i>

658
00:34:29,908 --> 00:34:31,780
<i>I have a fond
memory of that.</i>

659
00:34:31,855 --> 00:34:33,371
<i>And I have a...</i>

660
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:35,342
<i>hunch we're gonna be
needing some memories.</i>

661
00:34:35,378 --> 00:34:39,531
<i>So I'll just keep pointing this
memory-maker at you if you don't mind.</i>

662
00:34:40,176 --> 00:34:41,893
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

663
00:34:42,137 --> 00:34:44,332
<i>We're together forever, baby.</i>

664
00:34:44,575 --> 00:34:45,822
<i>You think so?</i>

665
00:34:45,908 --> 00:34:47,980
<i>WeWe shot the wrong car.</i>

666
00:34:48,108 --> 00:34:49,863
<i>We shot the wrong person.</i>

667
00:34:50,828 --> 00:34:52,271
<i>You saw the news?</i>

668
00:34:52,396 --> 00:34:55,161
<i>How could I miss the news?
It's everywhere.</i>

669
00:34:55,758 --> 00:34:57,960
<i>We shot a woman, Kathy!</i>

670
00:34:58,198 --> 00:35:00,270
<i>Some woman driving home!</i>

671
00:35:00,636 --> 00:35:02,761
<i>Okay. So next time
we'll kill the right person.</i>

672
00:35:02,787 --> 00:35:04,113
<i>What? Next time?</i>

673
00:35:04,348 --> 00:35:06,230
<i>Kathy, I don't know if I have
a </i>next time<i> in me.</i>

674
00:35:06,235 --> 00:35:08,252
<i>I mean, if we're lucky
to get away with this,</i>

675
00:35:08,287 --> 00:35:10,853
<i>I don't know if I want to
tempt fate with a "next time."</i>

676
00:35:11,137 --> 00:35:13,092
<i>Well, what's the alternative?</i>

677
00:35:13,298 --> 00:35:14,891
<i>I don't know.</i>

678
00:35:15,016 --> 00:35:16,861
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

679
00:35:17,785 --> 00:35:20,143
<i>We can't run away together--
you're still married.</i>

680
00:35:20,225 --> 00:35:22,221
<i>You're not gonna get the money.</i>

681
00:35:24,677 --> 00:35:26,683
<i>You tell me.
What do you think we should do?</i>

682
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:31,692
<i>Well, I don't think you should
sit there crying like a baby.</i>

683
00:35:32,267 --> 00:35:34,342
<i>Listen to yourself.</i>

684
00:35:34,907 --> 00:35:37,303
<i>You sound like you want
to commit suicide or something.</i>

685
00:35:37,547 --> 00:35:39,231
<i>Suicide?</i>

686
00:35:57,928 --> 00:35:59,532
<i>Seems to be working fine.</i>

687
00:35:59,815 --> 00:36:01,961
<i>No... I'm sure it is.
It's just, um...</i>

688
00:36:03,145 --> 00:36:05,550
<i>my boyfriend gave it to me
and... I'm just</i>

689
00:36:05,635 --> 00:36:06,913
<i>not a memory person</i

690
00:36:06,995 --> 00:36:08,833
<i>I'm really about
the here and the now.</i>

691
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,443
<i>So, here's the receipt.</i>

692
00:36:13,606 --> 00:36:16,681
<i>Any chance I can get cash?</i>

693
00:36:20,546 --> 00:36:21,740
Hello.

694
00:36:21,878 --> 00:36:23,870
Sorry to wake you at this hour

695
00:36:23,957 --> 00:36:26,393
but I thought you'd want to know
you were partially right.

696
00:36:27,357 --> 00:36:28,931
Right about what?

697
00:36:28,985 --> 00:36:30,880
Guy's name was Travis.

698
00:36:31,645 --> 00:36:34,161
What are you talking about?
Whose name was Travis?

699
00:36:35,298 --> 00:36:37,981
Travis McQueen, 24 years old.

700
00:36:38,607 --> 00:36:40,802
He's an Army sharpshooter.
Mustered out of the service

701
00:36:40,817 --> 00:36:42,290
5 months ago.

702
00:36:42,506 --> 00:36:44,543
Couple of uniforms
responded to an odd smell

703
00:36:44,568 --> 00:36:46,550
coming from
an apartment downtown.

704
00:36:47,715 --> 00:36:50,273
Found a high-powered rifle
with a night scope.

705
00:36:50,355 --> 00:36:52,110
<i>not to mention a dead body.</i>

706
00:36:52,238 --> 00:36:55,641
<i>Young guy. I'm guessing he's been
sitting here almost three days.</i>

707
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,161
Looks like a suicide.

708
00:36:59,535 --> 00:37:01,212
Of course it does.

709
00:37:12,345 --> 00:37:13,222
Sorry.

710
00:37:13,268 --> 00:37:15,630
I'm not sure if this
is where I'm supposed to be.

711
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:16,833
Diana.

712
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,670
Diana Marvin.

713
00:37:19,206 --> 00:37:22,060
I have a strong feeling this is exactly
where you're supposed to be.

714
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:27,861
Hi.

715
00:37:28,467 --> 00:37:29,791
Diana.

716
00:37:35,075 --> 00:37:36,433
Of course I know who he is.

717
00:37:36,558 --> 00:37:39,373
He's been a member of the club
I work at since I've been there.

718
00:37:39,695 --> 00:37:42,532
Not to mention he's been all over
the papers and the news.

719
00:37:42,696 --> 00:37:44,891
I know you arrested him,

720
00:37:44,976 --> 00:37:47,182
which is absurd.

721
00:37:47,986 --> 00:37:49,862
I feel so terrible for him.

722
00:37:49,898 --> 00:37:51,500
You know, what
happened to his life.

723
00:37:51,718 --> 00:37:53,032
It's just...

724
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,562
I know there's a
news blackout, but...

725
00:37:57,247 --> 00:38:00,803
are you folks any closer to catching
the person who's actually responsible?

726
00:38:00,886 --> 00:38:02,532
We certainly think so.

727
00:38:02,935 --> 00:38:04,291
That's good.

728
00:38:04,495 --> 00:38:05,971
If you don't mind my asking,

729
00:38:06,058 --> 00:38:07,592
just how well did you know him?

730
00:38:09,298 --> 00:38:11,090
We're getting awfully
personal here.

731
00:38:12,938 --> 00:38:15,502
I'm happy to help
with your investigation,

732
00:38:15,935 --> 00:38:17,701
You know, if Sean
needs a character witness,

733
00:38:17,786 --> 00:38:19,541
I'm only too happy
to help, but...

734
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:23,620
Sean indicated that the two of you
were deeply involved for some months.

735
00:38:25,446 --> 00:38:28,241
Is... is that against the law?

736
00:38:29,327 --> 00:38:31,203
Is that why I'm here?

737
00:38:31,238 --> 00:38:32,573
Do you mind if I ask...

738
00:38:32,725 --> 00:38:35,163
Who ended the affair?

739
00:38:35,977 --> 00:38:38,172
No one ended anything.

740
00:38:38,896 --> 00:38:40,892
Sean Caffey is a married man.

741
00:38:40,975 --> 00:38:43,933
The reality of the situation
became obvious to both of us.

742
00:38:43,975 --> 00:38:46,941
So you knew he wasn't about
to divorce his wife for you.

743
00:38:46,986 --> 00:38:48,582
He didn't offer.

744
00:38:48,948 --> 00:38:50,820
I certainly never asked.

745
00:38:51,598 --> 00:38:54,323
Do you mind if I ask
where you're going with this?

746
00:38:54,395 --> 00:38:58,203
Are you aware That Mr. Caffey
was bound to a prenuptial agreement

747
00:38:58,247 --> 00:39:00,011
that for all intents and purposes

748
00:39:00,025 --> 00:39:02,670
would leave him penniless if
his marriage ended in divorce?

749
00:39:03,278 --> 00:39:04,841
I don't understand
what you're saying.

750
00:39:04,917 --> 00:39:08,153
Penniless as a divorce
but extraordinarily wealthy

751
00:39:08,237 --> 00:39:09,720
as a widower.

752
00:39:13,808 --> 00:39:14,970
Well, it's...

753
00:39:16,258 --> 00:39:20,132
flattering to assume your lover
might do anything to be with you.

754
00:39:20,258 --> 00:39:22,860
That you could
stir that kind of...

755
00:39:24,106 --> 00:39:26,471
passion, in another person.

756
00:39:27,726 --> 00:39:30,613
Sean is many things,
but he is not a murderer.

757
00:39:30,695 --> 00:39:32,233
Not even with help?

758
00:39:32,285 --> 00:39:33,411
No.

759
00:39:33,498 --> 00:39:34,573
Not Sean.

760
00:39:35,535 --> 00:39:36,813
Not ever.

761
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,892
I believe you.

762
00:39:41,307 --> 00:39:42,621
Thank goodness.

763
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:44,021
I do, too.

764
00:39:44,068 --> 00:39:46,390
I don't think he had
anything to do with it.

765
00:39:46,867 --> 00:39:48,673
I don't think he knew
anything about it.

766
00:39:48,757 --> 00:39:50,230
I'm sure he didn't.

767
00:39:51,916 --> 00:39:54,830
Do you know a man
named Travis McQueen?

768
00:39:56,888 --> 00:39:58,930
Did you say "Travis"?

769
00:39:59,868 --> 00:40:02,623
I don't know anyone
by the name of Travis, no.

770
00:40:04,517 --> 00:40:06,272
He was a sharpshooter in the Army.

771
00:40:06,395 --> 00:40:08,032
Been out about six months now.

772
00:40:08,058 --> 00:40:09,491
He liked to hang around in the park,

773
00:40:09,528 --> 00:40:11,883
take long-lens pictures of pretty girls,
chat them up,

774
00:40:11,927 --> 00:40:15,123
talk about his adventures
as a sniper in Iraq.

775
00:40:15,218 --> 00:40:16,320
No, I'm sorry.

776
00:40:16,405 --> 00:40:17,842
How about Kathy?

777
00:40:19,347 --> 00:40:20,622
Kathy...

778
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:23,510
just Kathy?
Do she have a last name?

779
00:40:23,596 --> 00:40:25,270
I'm sure she does.

780
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:28,602
All I know is she
was Travis's girlfriend.

781
00:40:28,847 --> 00:40:31,641
or, at least,
she pretended to be.

782
00:40:31,725 --> 00:40:33,241
No, sorry.

783
00:40:34,208 --> 00:40:37,001
Don't know a Travis,
don't know a Kathy.

784
00:40:37,407 --> 00:40:40,093
And are you prepared
to swear to that?

785
00:40:40,215 --> 00:40:41,851
In a court of law?

786
00:40:41,936 --> 00:40:43,650
Excuse me?

787
00:40:47,105 --> 00:40:48,903
You have the right
to remain silent.

788
00:40:48,987 --> 00:40:52,590
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

789
00:40:52,677 --> 00:40:54,950
- You have the right to counsel.
- Hold on.

790
00:40:55,316 --> 00:40:57,081
I just told you--

791
00:40:57,206 --> 00:40:59,800
whoever this person is,
whoever his girlfriend is,

792
00:40:59,845 --> 00:41:02,440
however they were involved,
I don't know them.

793
00:41:02,487 --> 00:41:04,682
Why don't you bring
Allison's friend in here?

794
00:41:04,807 --> 00:41:06,213
Yeah.

795
00:41:11,186 --> 00:41:13,383
This will just take a second.

796
00:41:22,328 --> 00:41:24,160
This is the lady, right?

797
00:41:24,796 --> 00:41:26,073
Hi, Kathy.

798
00:41:27,325 --> 00:41:30,410
And you're prepared
to testify to that in a court of law?

799
00:41:30,495 --> 00:41:32,851
Yeah, sure.
That's her. Kathy.

800
00:41:32,975 --> 00:41:35,692
She came in and exchanged
a video camera for store credit.

801
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,292
How's that flash screen
working out for you?

802
00:41:39,896 --> 00:41:41,640
And the proof of purchase
was this receipt,

803
00:41:41,647 --> 00:41:44,070
charged to the credit
card of Travis McQueen?

804
00:41:44,156 --> 00:41:46,060
That's the receipt.

805
00:41:50,976 --> 00:41:52,663
You want to hear
something funny?

806
00:41:52,985 --> 00:41:55,541
It may well be that the
camera you returned...

807
00:41:57,107 --> 00:41:58,752
...is the one I sold her.

808
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:02,081
Go figure.

809
00:42:05,006 --> 00:42:08,701
