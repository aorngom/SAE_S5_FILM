1
00:00:11,735 --> 00:00:15,237
<i>We can cast off the shackles
of our daily lives.</i>

2
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,542
<i>We can go anywhere we want to go.</i>

3
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:25,614
<i>We can be any version of ourselves</i>

4
00:00:25,682 --> 00:00:27,616
<i>That we want to be.</i>

5
00:00:27,684 --> 00:00:30,619
<i>I'm not saying that isn't true.</i>

6
00:00:30,687 --> 00:00:33,756
<i>Who am I to contradict
a college textbook?</i>

7
00:00:33,823 --> 00:00:36,759
<i>But any schoolkid can tell you</i>

8
00:00:36,826 --> 00:00:39,595
<i>That there is one thing
you can't do in your dreams.</i>

9
00:00:40,664 --> 00:00:42,831
<i>You can't die.</i>

10
00:00:44,868 --> 00:00:47,036
<i>According to just about every schoolkid</i>

11
00:00:47,103 --> 00:00:48,871
<i>Who's ever lived--</i>

12
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:50,973
<i>If you actually die in your dream,</i>

13
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:53,208
<i>You'll die in real life, too.</i>

14
00:00:53,276 --> 00:00:55,878
<i>We laugh at that idea
as we get older.</i>

15
00:00:55,946 --> 00:00:57,913
<i>But I wonder sometimes:</i>

16
00:00:57,981 --> 00:01:00,215
<i>Can we ever be absolutely sure</i>

17
00:01:00,283 --> 00:01:03,252
<i>That those kids are wrong?</i>

18
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,256
<i>I mean, if your dream
does kill you,</i>

19
00:01:07,324 --> 00:01:09,625
<i>You're not around to talk
about it, right?</i>

20
00:01:09,693 --> 00:01:11,794
<i>They'll call it a heart attack.</i>

21
00:01:11,861 --> 00:01:15,164
<i>They'll say you died
in your sleep.</i>

22
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:17,733
<i>They'll never know
what actually happened</i>

23
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:21,103
<i>Is that your worst nightmare
finally caught up with you.</i>

24
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:27,676
You okay?

25
00:01:27,744 --> 00:01:29,678
You all right?

26
00:01:29,746 --> 00:01:31,680
Actually, I'm dead.

27
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,351
Get some more sleep.

28
00:01:35,418 --> 00:01:37,419
You'll feel better.

29
00:01:42,525 --> 00:01:46,462
<i>S06E06
Bite me</i>

30
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,891
<i>They're coming to get you, Barbara.</i>

31
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,560
<i>Stop it.</i>

32
00:02:32,627 --> 00:02:33,961
<i>You're ignorant.</i>

33
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,764
<i>They're coming for you, Barbara.</i>

34
00:02:36,832 --> 00:02:39,066
<i>Look! There comes one of them now.</i>

35
00:02:39,134 --> 00:02:40,234
Cool.

36
00:02:40,302 --> 00:02:42,703
They really were coming for her.

37
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:44,338
- I'm getting out of here.
- <i>Johnny!</i>

38
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,379
<i>Johnny!</i>

39
00:02:52,447 --> 00:02:54,415
<i>Help me!</i>

40
00:02:54,483 --> 00:02:56,083
Hey, where you goin' ?

41
00:02:56,151 --> 00:02:57,751
You're not afraid, are you ?

42
00:02:57,819 --> 00:02:59,186
Hey, what're you watching over there ?

43
00:02:59,254 --> 00:03:01,222
It sounds pretty scary
for a Sunday morning.

44
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:04,058
It's some old movie called
<i>Night of the living dead.</i>

45
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:06,794
It's part of a zombie movie marathon

46
00:03:06,862 --> 00:03:08,829
That's going to be on until Halloween.

47
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:09,997
They're not running the one

48
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:11,398
Where everyone gets trapped in the mall,

49
00:03:11,466 --> 00:03:12,433
Are they ?

50
00:03:12,501 --> 00:03:15,169
Bridgette! I am going to kill you!

51
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:17,004
Mom!

52
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,472
Make her come and get this thing

53
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,908
Out of here!

54
00:03:20,976 --> 00:03:22,643
Bridgette, I mean it!

55
00:03:22,711 --> 00:03:25,479
Get in here
before I flush this thing!

56
00:03:25,547 --> 00:03:26,714
That thing has a name.

57
00:03:26,781 --> 00:03:27,815
Miss Scarlet.

58
00:03:27,883 --> 00:03:30,117
I don't care what your
stupid science class

59
00:03:30,185 --> 00:03:32,720
Decided to call their stupid pet.

60
00:03:32,787 --> 00:03:34,288
Get it out of here. Now!

61
00:03:34,356 --> 00:03:35,890
Bridgette, I thought you told me

62
00:03:35,957 --> 00:03:37,892
You were going to keep
miss Scarlet in your room.

63
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:40,761
I know, but miss Colletto
said tarantulas do better

64
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,796
In humid environments

65
00:03:42,864 --> 00:03:44,798
Like a bathroom or a basement.

66
00:03:44,866 --> 00:03:46,800
And it's not like I was
going to keep her in here.

67
00:03:46,868 --> 00:03:48,335
Humid,huh?

68
00:03:48,403 --> 00:03:50,838
How do you think she'll feel
at the bottom of the toilet?

69
00:03:50,906 --> 00:03:52,673
Ariel, relax. Bridgette, hey.

70
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:54,508
Bring miss Scarlet back into your room.

71
00:03:54,576 --> 00:03:57,578
You can bring her in here when
it's your turn to take a bath.

72
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,582
Scanlon.

73
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,584
He does know it's Sunday, right?

74
00:04:03,652 --> 00:04:05,586
Hey. What's going on?

75
00:04:05,654 --> 00:04:07,588
Hey, I know it's the weekend,
but I was wondering

76
00:04:07,656 --> 00:04:09,356
If there's any way you could
give me a hand with something.

77
00:04:09,424 --> 00:04:11,659
I got kind of a situation.

78
00:04:11,726 --> 00:04:14,628
What kind of situation?

79
00:04:14,696 --> 00:04:16,630
You're damn right, I'm upset.

80
00:04:16,698 --> 00:04:18,299
Something bad has happened to him,

81
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:20,167
And you people don't seem to care.

82
00:04:20,235 --> 00:04:22,670
This is a man who has given discounts

83
00:04:22,737 --> 00:04:24,371
To the policemen and firemen

84
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:27,374
For as long as he's been in business.

85
00:04:27,442 --> 00:04:29,210
He's even buried a few men for free

86
00:04:29,277 --> 00:04:32,046
When he realized that
the families couldn't afford it.

87
00:04:32,113 --> 00:04:34,381
And now that he needs you,

88
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:37,151
All I hear is, it's too soon

89
00:04:37,219 --> 00:04:39,653
To file a missing persons report.

90
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:42,656
The person who answered
your call obviously wasn't aware

91
00:04:42,724 --> 00:04:44,291
Of your father's special relationship

92
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:45,426
With the department.

93
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,094
Which is why we're here to assure you

94
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,696
That this is being taken seriously.

95
00:04:48,763 --> 00:04:51,065
We're doing everything
we can to find your father.

96
00:04:51,132 --> 00:04:51,699
Now, do you think it's possible

97
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,267
Thanks.

98
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,102
That he may have just slipped
away without telling you?

99
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,770
Maybe taken some time off?

100
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,772
You haven't heard a word
I've said, have you?

101
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,274
He's not taking time off.

102
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,508
He doesn't take time off.

103
00:05:01,576 --> 00:05:02,977
"time off" is not in my father's dna.

104
00:05:03,044 --> 00:05:05,412
This is a man who lives to work.

105
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,580
Period.

106
00:05:06,648 --> 00:05:09,283
He's been running
this place for 40 years.

107
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:10,618
And as far as I know,

108
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,620
The only time he's taken time off

109
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,455
Was the morning that I was born.

110
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,956
And that was only because my mother

111
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,725
Threatened to kill him if he didn't.

112
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,195
Okay, well...

113
00:05:21,263 --> 00:05:23,197
Along those same lines,
did he have any enemies?

114
00:05:23,265 --> 00:05:24,832
Anyone who may have wished him harm?

115
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,802
Ten, twelve years ago,

116
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,272
I would've said "no."

117
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:34,041
He was always a very loved man.

118
00:05:34,109 --> 00:05:37,044
He was the president of
the chamber of commerce three times.

119
00:05:37,112 --> 00:05:38,779
He always sponsored a little league team.

120
00:05:38,847 --> 00:05:41,248
He loved this neighborhood.

121
00:05:41,316 --> 00:05:43,917
I think that's why he was so upset

122
00:05:43,985 --> 00:05:46,920
When he started to see it change
with the drugs

123
00:05:46,988 --> 00:05:49,757
And the crime and the dealers...

124
00:05:49,824 --> 00:05:52,259
The gangs.

125
00:05:52,327 --> 00:05:55,262
You know, daddy's never been shy
about his opinion

126
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,264
With regard to the state
of things around here.

127
00:05:57,332 --> 00:06:00,367
And on more than one occasion,

128
00:06:00,435 --> 00:06:01,402
He's had words with

129
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:02,569
The drug dealers.

130
00:06:02,637 --> 00:06:04,271
Maybe...

131
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:07,274
One of them, finally just...

132
00:06:07,342 --> 00:06:09,143
Just got rid of him.

133
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,278
Now, if you'll excuse me,

134
00:06:11,346 --> 00:06:14,281
I have two funerals this morning.

135
00:06:14,349 --> 00:06:16,350
The dead don't like
to be kept waiting.

136
00:06:20,055 --> 00:06:21,855
Yikes.

137
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:25,693
Okay, here's the plan.

138
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,696
I put miss Scarlet on the tip
of Ariel's toothbrush

139
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,030
and you take a picture.

140
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,199
And then, once Ariel's done

141
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,635
brushing her teeth,
we show her the picture.

142
00:06:34,703 --> 00:06:37,071
Your spider looks funny
when he's sleeping.

143
00:06:38,173 --> 00:06:40,107
First of all, it's not a spider,

144
00:06:40,175 --> 00:06:41,442
it's a tarantula.

145
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:43,944
Second of all, it's not a he, it's a she.

146
00:06:44,012 --> 00:06:47,281
And third of all,
tarantulas don't sleep.

147
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:49,283
Well, this one does.

148
00:06:49,351 --> 00:06:51,352
What?

149
00:06:59,894 --> 00:07:01,829
What did miss Colletto say ?

150
00:07:01,896 --> 00:07:02,863
Was she mad?

151
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:04,865
No, sweetie, she wasn't mad.

152
00:07:04,933 --> 00:07:06,367
Nobody's mad.

153
00:07:06,434 --> 00:07:09,136
She was just sorry it took
her so long to call us back.

154
00:07:09,204 --> 00:07:11,505
She wanted to make sure that
you don't worry about it.

155
00:07:11,573 --> 00:07:14,541
She said there's no way
of knowing how old miss Scarlet was,

156
00:07:14,609 --> 00:07:17,845
And it was probably just her time.

157
00:07:17,912 --> 00:07:19,913
That isn't your fault.

158
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,884
I think I'm just going to go to bed.

159
00:07:23,952 --> 00:07:25,719
I thought we were going
to finish this together.

160
00:07:25,787 --> 00:07:28,455
You can finish it without me.

161
00:07:28,523 --> 00:07:30,524
I'm just not in the mood
anymore.

162
00:07:34,362 --> 00:07:36,130
Did miss Colletto happen to mention

163
00:07:36,197 --> 00:07:39,032
what we were supposed to do with
the spectacular spider remains?

164
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,102
Apparently,
miss Scarlet is flushable.

165
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,370
Burial at sea.

166
00:07:43,438 --> 00:07:46,507
Excellent.
What about the terrarium?

167
00:07:46,574 --> 00:07:48,575
She said if we
don't have any use for it,

168
00:07:48,643 --> 00:07:50,110
We can just throw it away.

169
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,279
Seems that she has more than
she needs in her classroom.

170
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,782
Dead tarantulas,

171
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,817
Flesh-eating zombies,

172
00:07:56,885 --> 00:07:59,853
And a missing funeral parlor director.

173
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:02,856
Halloween isn't exactly
being subtle this year.

174
00:08:14,436 --> 00:08:15,636
Hey, come on, barb.

175
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,204
Church was this morning, huh?

176
00:08:17,272 --> 00:08:19,206
I'm sorry.

177
00:08:19,274 --> 00:08:21,208
Was that you who just
said something to me?

178
00:08:21,276 --> 00:08:23,877
And did you say it in black and white?

179
00:08:23,945 --> 00:08:26,380
I mean, praying's for church, huh

180
00:08:26,448 --> 00:08:27,915
Come on.

181
00:08:27,982 --> 00:08:28,949
Wait, back up.

182
00:08:29,017 --> 00:08:30,951
Did you just call me "Barb"?

183
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:33,954
My name's Allison.

184
00:08:34,022 --> 00:08:35,456
And I'm not sure I like

185
00:08:35,523 --> 00:08:37,825
What this black and white
is doing to my skin.

186
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,097
Do you remember one time,
when we were small,

187
00:08:44,165 --> 00:08:46,099
We were out here?

188
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:47,768
It was from right over there.

189
00:08:47,836 --> 00:08:49,803
I jumped out at you from behind a tree,

190
00:08:49,871 --> 00:08:52,473
And grandpa got all excited
and he shook his fist at me

191
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,476
And he said, "boy,
you'll be damned to hell."

192
00:08:55,543 --> 00:08:58,011
You used to really be scared here.

193
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,014
This is really freaky.

194
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,016
You're still afraid.

195
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,959
They're coming to get you, Barbara.

196
00:09:12,026 --> 00:09:13,961
You've got to stop calling me Barbara!

197
00:09:14,028 --> 00:09:15,295
My name is Allison!

198
00:09:15,363 --> 00:09:17,798
Even though this is a dream,
my name is Allison!

199
00:09:17,866 --> 00:09:20,834
They're coming for you, Barbara.

200
00:09:20,902 --> 00:09:22,002
Look!

201
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,238
There comes one of them now.

202
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,554
Don't worry.

203
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:15,622
You're going to wake up soon.

204
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:26,900
Hey, is that your house?

205
00:10:26,968 --> 00:10:28,936
I need to get inside!
We both really

206
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,337
Need to get inside...

207
00:10:46,821 --> 00:10:48,755
Hey, what's going on?

208
00:10:48,823 --> 00:10:50,057
You all right ?

209
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,392
Yeah, nothing.

210
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,660
It's a nightmare.

211
00:10:53,728 --> 00:10:54,795
It's just a nightmare.

212
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:55,862
Sorry, honey.

213
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,631
Go back to sleep.

214
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:00,701
What? Allison?!

215
00:11:00,768 --> 00:11:02,603
What did you do to your arm?

216
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,905
Oh, my god.

217
00:11:09,015 --> 00:11:11,684
I just don't understand
how this happened.

218
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:13,118
I was having a dream,

219
00:11:13,186 --> 00:11:16,455
A weird, old zombie movie dream.

220
00:11:18,124 --> 00:11:19,658
Well, I mean...

221
00:11:19,726 --> 00:11:22,962
If you were dreaming,
you weren't, like, in control.

222
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:24,997
You just, like, grabbed yourself--

223
00:11:25,065 --> 00:11:27,032
You grabbed your arm,
and you scratched yourself up.

224
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,567
Really ripped the skin.

225
00:11:28,635 --> 00:11:31,070
But, you know, it's not that unusual.

226
00:11:31,137 --> 00:11:32,538
Had a roommate in college

227
00:11:32,606 --> 00:11:35,140
Who used to throw punches in his sleep.

228
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,609
I sometimes grind my teeth.

229
00:11:36,676 --> 00:11:38,711
I mean, it's not like
you went in the garage

230
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:40,746
And, like, started up the skill saw.

231
00:11:40,814 --> 00:11:42,681
I mean, you scratched yourself.

232
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:44,416
You scratched the crap out of yourself,

233
00:11:44,484 --> 00:11:46,318
But still...

234
00:11:48,021 --> 00:11:49,021
Okay.

235
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:50,522
Voilà .

236
00:11:51,992 --> 00:11:53,192
Groundskeeper found Bobbi Catalano's dad

237
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,761
A little over an hour ago.

238
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:57,997
Forensics thinks he was killed
out there by those graves,

239
00:11:58,064 --> 00:12:00,132
Then dragged in here and out of sight.

240
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,600
Wallet and watch are gone.

241
00:12:01,668 --> 00:12:03,502
Car is still parked in the parking lot.

242
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,472
Do we have any idea
what he was doing out here ?

243
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:07,773
Given his profession, you'd think

244
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:08,908
It might have been work-related,

245
00:12:08,975 --> 00:12:10,276
But apparently,

246
00:12:10,343 --> 00:12:13,312
One of those headstones over
there belongs to his wife.

247
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,381
Best guess is, he was visiting her

248
00:12:15,448 --> 00:12:16,815
When someone jumped him.

249
00:12:16,883 --> 00:12:19,018
Smashed his head in with a
stone and emptied his pockets.

250
00:12:19,085 --> 00:12:22,688
It's kind of a strange place
for a mugging, don't you think?

251
00:12:22,756 --> 00:12:24,623
Well, yes and no.

252
00:12:24,691 --> 00:12:27,159
It's quiet, isolated.

253
00:12:27,227 --> 00:12:29,428
If you yell for help,
there's no one around to hear

254
00:12:29,496 --> 00:12:30,863
Except for a bunch of dead people.

255
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:33,532
Feel free to take a look around

256
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,868
And see if you get anything.

257
00:12:35,936 --> 00:12:37,336
I'm going to go call ms. Catalano

258
00:12:37,404 --> 00:12:39,071
And let her know we found her dad.

259
00:13:02,095 --> 00:13:03,729
Sir?

260
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:09,168
Sir.

261
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:15,107
Sir, are you all right?

262
00:13:22,115 --> 00:13:23,582
What the hell is going on?

263
00:13:28,054 --> 00:13:29,088
Allison, go for help.

264
00:13:29,155 --> 00:13:30,556
Get them to call an ambulance.

265
00:13:32,826 --> 00:13:37,262
The mesozoic era is often called
the age of the reptiles.

266
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,232
Reptiles were the dominant form
of life on earth

267
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,035
For the entire era, which lasted...

268
00:13:44,938 --> 00:13:46,939
...Almost 200 million years.

269
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:52,044
The mesozoic era is divided
into three distinct periods.

270
00:13:55,448 --> 00:13:56,648
Bridgette?

271
00:13:57,784 --> 00:13:58,917
Are you all right?

272
00:14:04,324 --> 00:14:06,325
Hi, kiddo.

273
00:14:07,394 --> 00:14:08,627
No hello?

274
00:14:08,695 --> 00:14:10,362
Is everything okay?

275
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,998
I think miss Scarlet's mad at me.

276
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:14,533
Miss Scarlet?

277
00:14:14,601 --> 00:14:16,168
The spider ?

278
00:14:16,236 --> 00:14:17,703
I don't think that's
possible, honey.

279
00:14:17,771 --> 00:14:20,305
I was there when
miss Scarlet was fl...

280
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,476
Laid to rest,
and I don't think she can be mad

281
00:14:24,544 --> 00:14:26,178
At anyone or anything at this point.

282
00:14:26,246 --> 00:14:28,013
I think she can.

283
00:14:28,081 --> 00:14:29,715
And I think she is.

284
00:14:29,783 --> 00:14:31,116
And I deserve it.

285
00:14:31,184 --> 00:14:32,518
Why?

286
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:36,155
Because I gave her some candy.

287
00:14:36,222 --> 00:14:38,023
What?

288
00:14:38,091 --> 00:14:40,526
I fed her some candy.

289
00:14:40,593 --> 00:14:43,362
I put some candy in her cage,

290
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,697
Just to see if she'd like it.

291
00:14:47,267 --> 00:14:49,468
I think that's why she died.

292
00:14:49,536 --> 00:14:51,070
Paging dr. Stateman.

293
00:14:51,137 --> 00:14:53,138
His name's Edgar Kripke.

294
00:14:53,206 --> 00:14:55,507
According to social services,
he's a drug addict

295
00:14:55,575 --> 00:14:57,009
And a paranoid schizophrenic.

296
00:14:57,077 --> 00:14:59,278
When he couldn't get a bed at
the local homeless shelter,

297
00:14:59,345 --> 00:15:00,512
He'd sleep in that cemetery.

298
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,681
Bobbi Catalano told me that kripke

299
00:15:02,749 --> 00:15:04,850
Had actually had words
with her father before.

300
00:15:04,918 --> 00:15:07,119
I guess her dad wasn't
too happy that this guy

301
00:15:07,187 --> 00:15:09,621
Was crashing a few hundred
yards from his wife's grave.

302
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:11,490
Carl actually called
the police on him once.

303
00:15:11,558 --> 00:15:12,825
Had him arrested for vagrancy.

304
00:15:12,892 --> 00:15:14,726
But that doesn't prove that he...

305
00:15:14,794 --> 00:15:17,329
We searched the cardboard
box that Kripke calls home.

306
00:15:17,397 --> 00:15:20,332
Found Carl's wallet
in there and his watch.

307
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,468
What about the blood around his mouth?

308
00:15:22,535 --> 00:15:23,902
And the groaning?

309
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,370
Drug overdose.

310
00:15:25,438 --> 00:15:27,573
He must have just gotten
high when you spotted him.

311
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,842
His doctor says it caused
some serious brain damage.

312
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:31,610
What kind of drug does that?

313
00:15:31,678 --> 00:15:34,513
You ever heard of something called "wet"?

314
00:15:34,581 --> 00:15:37,583
Cigarettes soaked in methanol,
formaldehyde and ethanol.

315
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,951
It's a hallucinogen. Believe it or not,

316
00:15:39,018 --> 00:15:40,185
There's actually demand for this stuff.

317
00:15:40,253 --> 00:15:42,187
The government's been
trying to make it harder

318
00:15:42,255 --> 00:15:43,789
For the people who cook this stuff up

319
00:15:43,857 --> 00:15:45,190
To get their hands on the ingredients,

320
00:15:45,258 --> 00:15:47,259
But we just keep seeing
more and more of it.

321
00:15:47,327 --> 00:15:49,628
So, what, this guy just fried his brain?

322
00:15:49,696 --> 00:15:52,431
We're never going to get him
to admit what he did.
It's okay.

323
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:54,633
I think we got enough
to pin this murder on Kripke,

324
00:15:54,701 --> 00:15:56,068
Whether he ever talks again or not.

325
00:15:57,871 --> 00:15:59,271
I don't know exactly what it was

326
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:01,206
That drew your attention
to this deadbeat, but

327
00:16:01,274 --> 00:16:03,709
I'm glad it happened.

328
00:16:03,776 --> 00:16:07,613
At least now we got some
answers for Carl's daughter.

329
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,214
So, Bridgette thinks she's being haunted

330
00:16:09,282 --> 00:16:10,449
By that dead spider?

331
00:16:10,517 --> 00:16:11,984
Yes, indeedy.

332
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:13,685
So, what did you tell her?

333
00:16:13,753 --> 00:16:15,220
I suggested she talk to her teacher

334
00:16:15,288 --> 00:16:17,856
And tell her that she fed
candy to the class pet.

335
00:16:17,924 --> 00:16:19,558
Well, how is that going to help?

336
00:16:19,626 --> 00:16:21,493
She's obviously got a guilty conscience,

337
00:16:21,561 --> 00:16:23,195
Not to mention an overactive imagination,

338
00:16:23,263 --> 00:16:25,197
So I just figured if she confessed, then...

339
00:16:25,265 --> 00:16:26,398
Okay, I get that.

340
00:16:26,466 --> 00:16:28,267
You've been at this for a while.

341
00:16:28,334 --> 00:16:30,035
Have you ever communed
with any dead insects?

342
00:16:30,103 --> 00:16:31,270
Now that you mention it,

343
00:16:31,337 --> 00:16:34,873
I'm going to have to add
that to my to-do list.

344
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:38,443
<i>...Reports, incredible as they seem,</i>

345
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:40,913
Are not the results of mass hysteria.

346
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,015
A wave of murder, which is sweeping

347
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:46,418
The eastern third of the nation,
is being committed by creatures

348
00:16:46,486 --> 00:16:49,655
Who feast upon the flesh
of their victims.

349
00:16:49,722 --> 00:16:52,424
I think we have some late word
just arriving.

350
00:16:52,492 --> 00:16:55,127
This is the latest disclosure
in a report

351
00:16:55,195 --> 00:16:58,197
From national civil defense
headquarters in washington.

352
00:16:58,264 --> 00:17:01,466
"it has been established that
persons who have recently died

353
00:17:01,534 --> 00:17:05,304
Have been returning to life
and committing acts of murder."

354
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,741
"widespread investigation
of reports from funeral homes,

355
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:11,944
"morgues and hospitals has concluded

356
00:17:12,011 --> 00:17:15,681
"that the unburied dead
are coming back to life

357
00:17:15,748 --> 00:17:17,849
And seeking human victims."

358
00:17:32,165 --> 00:17:33,665
Hello?

359
00:17:36,803 --> 00:17:38,103
Joe.

360
00:17:38,171 --> 00:17:39,605
Oh, my god.

361
00:17:39,672 --> 00:17:41,206
What are you doing here?

362
00:17:41,274 --> 00:17:42,474
I'm sorry. My name's not Joe.

363
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:44,543
It's Dale. It's Dale Cosgrove.

364
00:17:44,611 --> 00:17:46,011
Don't you remember?

365
00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:48,914
I saved you from that creature

366
00:17:48,982 --> 00:17:51,183
Who was trying to get in here.

367
00:17:51,251 --> 00:17:52,818
You fell down, and you hit your head.

368
00:17:52,885 --> 00:17:55,287
We put you on the couch
so you could sleep it off.

369
00:17:55,355 --> 00:17:57,256
But now you're up,
I could use your help.

370
00:17:57,323 --> 00:17:59,124
I mean, if you're feeling up to it.

371
00:17:59,192 --> 00:18:00,759
And that creature who attacked you...

372
00:18:00,827 --> 00:18:03,295
He's got a lot of friends.

373
00:18:03,363 --> 00:18:05,731
Pretty sure they're coming back.

374
00:18:07,934 --> 00:18:09,001
Hey.

375
00:18:09,068 --> 00:18:11,169
I know what I'm talking about.

376
00:18:11,237 --> 00:18:12,604
My family and I were on the interstate,

377
00:18:12,672 --> 00:18:14,039
And we saw a whole bunch of them.

378
00:18:14,107 --> 00:18:15,707
I slowed down.
It was dark.

379
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:18,210
I didn't realize what they were at first.

380
00:18:18,278 --> 00:18:20,379
And before I knew what was happening...

381
00:18:20,446 --> 00:18:23,015
One of them got my wife's door open,

382
00:18:23,082 --> 00:18:25,050
And he... He pulled her out of the truck,

383
00:18:25,118 --> 00:18:27,919
And they all began biting at her,

384
00:18:27,987 --> 00:18:30,355
Ripping at her flesh with their teeth.

385
00:18:30,423 --> 00:18:32,090
That's horrible.

386
00:18:32,158 --> 00:18:33,625
So, we found your house,

387
00:18:33,693 --> 00:18:37,029
And... Hope you don't mind
that we set up camp here.

388
00:18:37,096 --> 00:18:38,997
It's fine with me.

389
00:18:39,065 --> 00:18:40,365
It's not my house.

390
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:42,434
I don't know whose house it is.

391
00:18:44,003 --> 00:18:45,804
Daddy?

392
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:49,107
My daughters.

393
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:51,643
That's Abigail, Mabel and Bella.

394
00:18:51,711 --> 00:18:53,612
I'm sorry... I didn't catch your name.

395
00:18:54,881 --> 00:18:56,915
I'm Allison.

396
00:18:59,085 --> 00:19:02,387
I'm Allison Dubois.

397
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:04,189
Daddy, I know you told us
to stay in the basement,

398
00:19:04,257 --> 00:19:05,257
But that man is getting worse.

399
00:19:05,325 --> 00:19:06,258
There's a man?

400
00:19:06,326 --> 00:19:07,259
What man?

401
00:19:07,327 --> 00:19:08,560
Someone else is here?

402
00:19:08,628 --> 00:19:10,228
We found him on the way.

403
00:19:10,296 --> 00:19:12,097
We saved him from a pack
of those things.

404
00:19:12,165 --> 00:19:14,433
They were
biting him and clawing at him,

405
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,168
So we brought him with us.

406
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:17,502
Girls, go to the kitchen.

407
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,737
Get him some water.

408
00:19:18,805 --> 00:19:20,639
See if he'll take a drink.

409
00:19:22,775 --> 00:19:24,242
We got to board this place up,

410
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,144
Wait it out until the police

411
00:19:26,212 --> 00:19:27,979
Or the national guard can come get us.

412
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:30,816
I think, if we can make
it till morning...

413
00:19:32,518 --> 00:19:33,952
- ...We'll be okay.
- They're back, daddy!

414
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,387
A whole bunch of them!

415
00:19:35,455 --> 00:19:37,022
You can see them through the window!

416
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,697
Damn it.

417
00:19:45,765 --> 00:19:47,532
We're going to need more wood.

418
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,867
And fast.

419
00:19:50,703 --> 00:19:52,704
Look for old furniture.

420
00:19:52,772 --> 00:19:55,674
Anything we can break into more boards.

421
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:16,995
Hey.

422
00:20:17,063 --> 00:20:18,897
Come on.
What are you staring at?

423
00:20:18,965 --> 00:20:20,065
We have work to do.

424
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:21,299
I'm sorry.

425
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:23,769
I know him.

426
00:20:23,836 --> 00:20:26,805
We kind of come from the same place.

427
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:32,177
Oh, my god.

428
00:20:34,781 --> 00:20:36,148
He's not breathing.

429
00:20:36,215 --> 00:20:38,150
Hey, come on down there!

430
00:20:38,217 --> 00:20:39,418
We need some wood!
Here.

431
00:20:39,485 --> 00:20:40,786
Here, you take this.

432
00:20:40,853 --> 00:20:42,754
I'll look for more.

433
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,247
No, no.

434
00:21:12,652 --> 00:21:13,685
Yeah?

435
00:21:13,753 --> 00:21:15,587
Al, what is it?
What's wrong?

436
00:21:18,624 --> 00:21:20,158
Oh, my god.

437
00:21:24,036 --> 00:21:25,503
Mr. Dubois?

438
00:21:28,173 --> 00:21:30,107
Hi... Doctor.

439
00:21:30,175 --> 00:21:31,409
How's my wife?

440
00:21:31,476 --> 00:21:32,643
She'll be fine.

441
00:21:32,711 --> 00:21:34,145
We dressed her wound,

442
00:21:34,212 --> 00:21:36,981
But I'm not sure that's
what we should call it.

443
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:38,149
What do you mean?

444
00:21:38,216 --> 00:21:39,951
Once we rinsed all the blood away...

445
00:21:40,018 --> 00:21:43,187
You know, her skin is...

446
00:21:43,255 --> 00:21:45,222
It's raw, it's inflamed.

447
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,124
There's clearly bruising.

448
00:21:47,192 --> 00:21:49,293
And it certainly seems for all the world

449
00:21:49,361 --> 00:21:50,761
Like she's been bitten.

450
00:21:50,829 --> 00:21:52,997
The only thing is,
there's no broken skin,

451
00:21:53,065 --> 00:21:55,533
No teeth marks, no actual trauma.

452
00:21:55,601 --> 00:21:58,102
How's that possible?

453
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,503
Well, one possibility,

454
00:21:59,571 --> 00:22:02,373
And the only possibility
I can think of is,

455
00:22:02,441 --> 00:22:05,276
There's a phenomenon
known as psychosomatic bruising.

456
00:22:05,344 --> 00:22:07,211
In very rare cases,

457
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:10,381
A patient sometimes can injure themselves.

458
00:22:12,751 --> 00:22:15,019
I don't think
that's possible in this case

459
00:22:15,087 --> 00:22:17,955
'cause the bite was on the back
of her calf, so I...

460
00:22:18,023 --> 00:22:20,291
Oh, the wounds wouldn't have
been caused by physical trauma.

461
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:23,561
The belief is, they're generated
by the patient's mind.

462
00:22:23,629 --> 00:22:26,631
The injuries are a subconscious
physiological response

463
00:22:26,698 --> 00:22:28,499
To extreme stress.

464
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:30,801
The theory is that your emotional state

465
00:22:30,869 --> 00:22:32,937
Can cause your blood vessels to engorge.

466
00:22:33,005 --> 00:22:34,538
And if it's bad enough,

467
00:22:34,606 --> 00:22:37,008
You could actually bleed
right through your pores.

468
00:22:37,075 --> 00:22:38,676
Now, you know, your wife did say

469
00:22:38,744 --> 00:22:41,712
That she's been having nightmares,
so I thought

470
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,814
Maybe all she needs is a couple nights

471
00:22:43,882 --> 00:22:46,117
Of uninterrupted sleep.

472
00:22:46,184 --> 00:22:48,019
So, here's a prescription
for sleeping pills,

473
00:22:48,086 --> 00:22:51,722
And beyond that...

474
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,090
That doesn't make much sense.

475
00:22:53,158 --> 00:22:54,925
<i>She wants me to get more sleep?</i>

476
00:22:54,993 --> 00:22:56,794
Hey, look, I don't know, you know?

477
00:22:56,862 --> 00:22:58,729
She seemed to think that, you know,

478
00:22:58,797 --> 00:23:00,398
A night of uninterrupted sleep was...

479
00:23:00,465 --> 00:23:02,933
Wait. I don't think she gets this.

480
00:23:03,001 --> 00:23:06,170
<i>I don't think I could survive
a night of uninterrupted sleep.</i>

481
00:23:06,238 --> 00:23:07,838
I mean, think about it.

482
00:23:07,906 --> 00:23:10,908
Even if she's right, even if
I'm doing this to myself,

483
00:23:10,976 --> 00:23:13,778
I'm still getting hurt.

484
00:23:13,845 --> 00:23:16,914
I dream that I get hurt,
I wake up, and I'm hurt.

485
00:23:16,982 --> 00:23:20,418
What if my next dream,
I dream that I break my leg,

486
00:23:20,485 --> 00:23:22,620
Or what if I die in my dream?

487
00:23:22,688 --> 00:23:25,256
Die? You don't think that
could happen, do you?

488
00:23:27,793 --> 00:23:28,893
Honey, this is crazy.

489
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,194
How do you not sleep?

490
00:23:30,262 --> 00:23:31,962
You have to sleep.

491
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:35,099
It's 6:15. The girls
are gonna be up in a minute.

492
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:37,635
I was hoping we'd get home before...

493
00:23:37,703 --> 00:23:39,370
Okay, here's what we're going to do.

494
00:23:39,438 --> 00:23:41,038
I'm going to stay awake tonight, okay?

495
00:23:41,106 --> 00:23:42,306
I'll watch you sleep.

496
00:23:42,374 --> 00:23:44,175
If it looks like you're
having a nightmare,

497
00:23:44,242 --> 00:23:45,509
Then I'll wake you up.

498
00:23:45,577 --> 00:23:47,812
And if you make it till midnight,
then we'll switch.

499
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:50,448
I'll sleep for a few hours,
and-and you stay awake.

500
00:23:50,515 --> 00:23:52,183
And we'll keep doing
that until morning.

501
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,118
And that way, between the two of us,

502
00:23:54,186 --> 00:23:55,619
We'll share a good night's sleep.

503
00:23:55,687 --> 00:23:58,355
How's that sound?

504
00:24:04,329 --> 00:24:05,796
Mrs. Dubois?

505
00:24:07,733 --> 00:24:09,934
Mrs. Catalano, I didn't know
you were coming by.

506
00:24:10,001 --> 00:24:12,336
I didn't know I was coming by.

507
00:24:12,404 --> 00:24:14,371
The district attorney
called me late last night,

508
00:24:14,439 --> 00:24:16,707
Invited me to be part
of a press conference

509
00:24:16,775 --> 00:24:18,008
That they're having this morning.

510
00:24:18,076 --> 00:24:22,079
Anyway, I saw you sitting over here,
and I wanted

511
00:24:22,147 --> 00:24:24,248
To come over and say thank you.

512
00:24:24,316 --> 00:24:26,650
They told me that you were the one

513
00:24:26,718 --> 00:24:28,319
Who figured out who killed daddy.

514
00:24:28,386 --> 00:24:30,354
Well, not me by myself,

515
00:24:30,422 --> 00:24:33,090
But you're very welcome.

516
00:24:33,158 --> 00:24:36,794
I am sure that you
hear this all the time,

517
00:24:36,862 --> 00:24:39,964
But if there's anything
that I can do for you...

518
00:24:40,031 --> 00:24:41,398
Oh, thank you.

519
00:24:41,466 --> 00:24:44,668
I'm just glad they caught the guy.

520
00:24:47,005 --> 00:24:49,106
Ooh, my.

521
00:24:49,174 --> 00:24:51,308
I'd better get going.

522
00:24:51,376 --> 00:24:53,177
Thank you.

523
00:24:56,882 --> 00:24:58,682
What happened to your hand ?

524
00:25:00,786 --> 00:25:03,554
It's really not that bad.

525
00:25:03,622 --> 00:25:06,891
Actually, I did it to myself.

526
00:25:06,958 --> 00:25:08,092
Really?

527
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,460
When I got the call

528
00:25:09,528 --> 00:25:11,262
About dad, and they told me

529
00:25:11,329 --> 00:25:13,497
That he was really dead, I must have

530
00:25:13,565 --> 00:25:16,200
Just grabbed my hand and
started squeezing it.

531
00:25:16,268 --> 00:25:19,170
Anything. Anything to keep
from screaming out loud,

532
00:25:19,237 --> 00:25:22,006
And I guess that...

533
00:25:22,073 --> 00:25:24,408
I didn't even realize
that I was doing that.

534
00:25:24,476 --> 00:25:26,410
But...

535
00:25:26,478 --> 00:25:28,879
Anyway, I'd better get going.

536
00:25:28,947 --> 00:25:30,948
Again, thank you.

537
00:25:37,823 --> 00:25:39,890
I'm really sorry, miss Colletto.

538
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:42,860
I shouldn't have given
miss Scarlet a piece of candy,

539
00:25:42,928 --> 00:25:46,096
And I should have told you what I did.

540
00:25:46,164 --> 00:25:49,667
Thanks for coming in
and telling me that, Bridgette.

541
00:25:49,734 --> 00:25:52,736
That must have been a hard thing to do.

542
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:56,240
Can you keep a secret?

543
00:25:57,876 --> 00:26:01,011
See mr. Nibbles back there?

544
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:03,013
No one else knows this,

545
00:26:03,081 --> 00:26:05,249
But he's really mr. Nibbles two.

546
00:26:05,317 --> 00:26:08,519
See, I took the first
mr. Nibbles home with me

547
00:26:08,587 --> 00:26:10,521
One weekend,
and I forgot to shut the door

548
00:26:10,589 --> 00:26:12,189
To the room where I was keeping him.

549
00:26:12,257 --> 00:26:14,358
Turns out, my cat was able
to knock the top off his cage.

550
00:26:14,426 --> 00:26:17,862
Long story short,
I spent most of my Sunday

551
00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:19,663
Driving from pet store to pet store

552
00:26:19,731 --> 00:26:21,298
Looking for a mr. Nibbles look-alike.

553
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:25,769
These things happen, Bridgette.

554
00:26:25,837 --> 00:26:28,005
You probably shouldn't
have given miss Scarlet

555
00:26:28,073 --> 00:26:30,507
A piece of candy,
but you can't even be sure

556
00:26:30,575 --> 00:26:32,009
That that's what made her die.

557
00:26:50,662 --> 00:26:53,230
Bridgette, what is it?

558
00:26:53,298 --> 00:26:55,032
Are you okay?

559
00:26:58,036 --> 00:27:00,971
She's got her sweatshirt like that

560
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,374
So the tarantula can't
get into her mouth.

561
00:27:08,747 --> 00:27:09,880
You still sore?

562
00:27:09,948 --> 00:27:11,115
Yeah. No.

563
00:27:11,182 --> 00:27:12,516
You know what's weird?

564
00:27:12,584 --> 00:27:14,952
Why don't we talk about
what isn't weird, huh?

565
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,120
That would be a much shorter conversation.

566
00:27:17,188 --> 00:27:19,757
You know that man... the one
who owned the funeral home,

567
00:27:19,824 --> 00:27:20,925
The man who was killed?

568
00:27:20,992 --> 00:27:22,326
His daughter came into work today,

569
00:27:22,394 --> 00:27:24,461
And she had the exact same cuts I have.

570
00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:26,597
What do you mean?

571
00:27:26,665 --> 00:27:29,566
I mean, exactly the same...
the same place, same everything.

572
00:27:29,634 --> 00:27:32,836
Maybe she ran into
the same zombie you did.

573
00:27:32,904 --> 00:27:34,171
They were exactly the same.

574
00:27:34,239 --> 00:27:36,006
That can't be a coincidence, can it?

575
00:27:36,074 --> 00:27:37,241
I don't know, Al.

576
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:38,909
And I'm happy to keep talking about it

577
00:27:38,977 --> 00:27:40,978
For as long as you like,
but keep in mind,

578
00:27:41,046 --> 00:27:42,446
You're cutting into
your first sleep shift.

579
00:27:42,514 --> 00:27:46,317
Remember, you got to be up
to relieve me in three hours.

580
00:27:46,384 --> 00:27:51,021
If I even snore weird,
you're gonna wake me up, right?

581
00:27:51,089 --> 00:27:52,489
You go to sleep.

582
00:27:52,557 --> 00:27:53,691
I got it covered.

583
00:27:53,758 --> 00:27:56,126
I'm not going to let
anything happen to you.

584
00:28:04,703 --> 00:28:06,370
No! No! No!

585
00:28:30,061 --> 00:28:34,965
Joe, if you can hear me,
I'd really like to wake up now.

586
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:46,677
Joe!

587
00:29:06,998 --> 00:29:08,098
Let us in!

588
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:09,333
Please! Dad's hurt.

589
00:29:09,401 --> 00:29:10,834
You have to let us in.

590
00:29:10,902 --> 00:29:12,069
Can you hear me?

591
00:29:12,137 --> 00:29:14,104
You have to help us!
You promised !

592
00:29:14,172 --> 00:29:15,639
No, I can't!

593
00:29:15,707 --> 00:29:17,107
Please. I'm out of bullets.

594
00:29:17,175 --> 00:29:19,009
For the love of god, let us in!

595
00:29:19,077 --> 00:29:20,210
No!

596
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:21,712
No. I have to protect myself.

597
00:29:22,947 --> 00:29:25,783
If I let you in, you might kill me.

598
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:28,452
I can't let myself die in a dream!

599
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,387
Let us in, please?

600
00:29:30,455 --> 00:29:32,689
No, I can't.

601
00:29:33,958 --> 00:29:35,225
I'm sorry.

602
00:29:35,293 --> 00:29:36,927
Oh, no, I don't want to die.

603
00:29:36,995 --> 00:29:38,162
I don't want to die.

604
00:29:38,229 --> 00:29:39,730
I don't want to die!

605
00:29:39,798 --> 00:29:41,632
I don't want to die.
I don't to die.

606
00:29:41,699 --> 00:29:42,900
I don't want to die.
Allison.

607
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:44,268
I don't want to... die!
Easy.

608
00:29:44,335 --> 00:29:46,003
It's okay. You're awake.

609
00:29:46,071 --> 00:29:48,839
You're safe.

610
00:29:51,088 --> 00:29:53,456
Hey, Al, it was just a dream,
that's all it was.

611
00:29:53,524 --> 00:29:55,759
Okay? Nothing scratched you,
nothing bit you.

612
00:29:55,826 --> 00:29:57,260
You're fine.

613
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,329
I know, you're right.

614
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,300
It's your turn.

615
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:06,603
<i>This one is nice and fresh,</i>

616
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:08,471
But if this was all brown,
you just simply want to...

617
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:11,508
And that's his first two.
Devon Gray, and there's...

618
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:13,944
...Harriet Banks are the lucky winners

619
00:30:14,011 --> 00:30:15,645
Of this past weekend's
super lottery draw.

620
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:18,982
The pair came forward to claim
their $11 million prize...

621
00:30:40,204 --> 00:30:42,272
Hello?

622
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,509
Hello?

623
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:06,956
Careful. That's hot.

624
00:32:08,392 --> 00:32:10,627
You already know that, don't you?

625
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,962
Why are you pointing that thing at me?

626
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,397
I'm not one of them.

627
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:16,399
We know exactly who you are, Barbara.

628
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:17,567
My name is not Barbara.

629
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:18,768
It's Allison.

630
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:20,337
Don't bother lying.

631
00:32:20,404 --> 00:32:23,306
We already found
your lab over that hill.

632
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:24,607
We know all about the concoction

633
00:32:24,675 --> 00:32:26,176
You cooked up in your tanks, Barbara.

634
00:32:26,243 --> 00:32:28,044
What are you talking about?

635
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,679
We know that everything
that happened here

636
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:31,981
Last night was your fault.

637
00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:34,250
I've never seen these things before.

638
00:32:34,318 --> 00:32:35,518
Look.

639
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:37,320
I don't know what you're talking about.

640
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:39,155
What lab, what concoction?

641
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,191
You made all those people sick, Barbara.

642
00:32:41,258 --> 00:32:42,192
You poisoned them.

643
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:44,527
No, you're wrong.

644
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:46,529
You know what?

645
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:48,531
I'm glad I was the one who found you.

646
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,500
No, where am I going?!

647
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:52,869
The pentagon wants us to keep
a few of the specimens alive.

648
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:54,170
Given their ravenous appetites,

649
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:55,638
I was worried the creatures
wouldn't make it

650
00:32:55,706 --> 00:32:57,607
All the way to Washington.

651
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,642
I guess it's good we found them a snack.

652
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,177
No!

653
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:02,178
Get that door.

654
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:03,380
No.

655
00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:04,714
No, please!

656
00:33:20,731 --> 00:33:22,832
Let me out!

657
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,034
Please.

658
00:33:30,474 --> 00:33:31,908
Let me out!

659
00:33:40,016 --> 00:33:43,185
Hey, you never woke me.

660
00:33:43,253 --> 00:33:45,087
I fell asleep.

661
00:33:45,155 --> 00:33:47,189
And?

662
00:33:47,257 --> 00:33:48,991
It was horrible.

663
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:51,127
I guess I survived it, though.

664
00:33:51,194 --> 00:33:52,995
Scanlon and Devalos were there.

665
00:33:53,063 --> 00:33:54,163
Really?

666
00:33:54,231 --> 00:33:57,333
Any sign of the tin
man or the scarecrow?

667
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,434
They kept calling me Barbara,

668
00:33:58,502 --> 00:34:00,302
and they said I was
responsible for all of it

669
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,738
And then they threw me
in the back of this truck,

670
00:34:02,806 --> 00:34:06,742
And you were there and the girls.

671
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:10,146
Wait a second, I thought you said
that we were all dead.

672
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,489
You all ate me,
all of you feasted on me.

673
00:34:23,493 --> 00:34:27,429
You don't look any worse for wear.

674
00:34:27,497 --> 00:34:31,600
Seriously, wasn't this
exactly the kind of dream

675
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:33,502
That we were worried about?

676
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,171
I mean, if we did actually, you know,

677
00:34:35,238 --> 00:34:37,139
Eat you in this dream,

678
00:34:37,207 --> 00:34:39,508
It's pretty safe to
assume that you were dead

679
00:34:39,576 --> 00:34:40,809
If not when the meal started,

680
00:34:40,877 --> 00:34:42,311
Certainly by the time it ended.

681
00:34:42,379 --> 00:34:46,415
You're not dreaming now and
you look pretty lively to me.

682
00:34:46,483 --> 00:34:48,417
I guess you're right.

683
00:34:48,485 --> 00:34:51,854
<i>It's usually a series of four
treatment sessions to reduce...</i>

684
00:34:51,922 --> 00:34:53,355
What is that?

685
00:34:53,423 --> 00:34:57,159
I guess I did sustain
an injury in that dream.

686
00:34:57,227 --> 00:34:59,395
When I touched something hot,
it burned me.

687
00:34:59,462 --> 00:35:01,597
Oh, god.

688
00:35:01,665 --> 00:35:06,135
I guess if you dreamt
about being eaten alive

689
00:35:06,203 --> 00:35:08,837
By the reanimated corpses
of your dead family,

690
00:35:08,905 --> 00:35:10,706
And that's the only
wound you got, I guess

691
00:35:10,774 --> 00:35:13,175
You could consider yourself lucky.

692
00:35:15,245 --> 00:35:16,679
I'm sorry.

693
00:35:16,746 --> 00:35:19,748
No one was in front, so I just
made my way around the back.

694
00:35:19,816 --> 00:35:22,284
Oh, it's okay, mrs. Dubois.

695
00:35:22,352 --> 00:35:24,053
What can I do for you?

696
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,623
I brought by your father's
personal effects.

697
00:35:27,691 --> 00:35:30,326
I read in the paper that

698
00:35:30,393 --> 00:35:32,127
the viewing was tomorrow,
and I wanted to make sure

699
00:35:32,195 --> 00:35:34,863
that you had everything
you needed... his watch,

700
00:35:34,931 --> 00:35:36,832
His wedding band.

701
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,335
You're very thoughtful.

702
00:35:39,402 --> 00:35:41,337
Actually, our embalmer Steven's

703
00:35:41,404 --> 00:35:44,006
On his way over with daddy's remains.

704
00:35:44,074 --> 00:35:48,077
I was just getting... The room ready.

705
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,847
You all right?

706
00:35:51,915 --> 00:35:56,652
Oh, I'm sorry, it's just...

707
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,854
Daddy always used to say,

708
00:35:58,922 --> 00:36:01,724
"death never takes
the wise man by surprise ;

709
00:36:01,791 --> 00:36:05,894
He is always ready to go or to let go."

710
00:36:05,962 --> 00:36:09,164
I guess I'm not feeling
terribly wise right now.

711
00:36:13,603 --> 00:36:17,072
Shoot.

712
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,507
Do you happen to have a pen?

713
00:36:18,575 --> 00:36:21,343
If you wouldn't mind
signing this receipt

714
00:36:21,411 --> 00:36:23,879
that you received your
father's personal effects...

715
00:36:27,117 --> 00:36:30,119
Could you just give me one
moment to empty the autoclave?

716
00:36:30,186 --> 00:36:31,553
I was just cleaning some instruments

717
00:36:31,621 --> 00:36:34,356
For Steven.

718
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:49,138
Excuse me, what are those ?

719
00:36:50,173 --> 00:36:52,975
Those?

720
00:36:53,043 --> 00:36:54,176
They're the embalming tanks.

721
00:36:54,244 --> 00:36:55,611
They hold the fluid the embalmer uses

722
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:59,048
to replace the blood in the dead body.

723
00:36:59,115 --> 00:37:01,116
Ethanol, methanol,

724
00:37:01,184 --> 00:37:04,086
Formaldehyde.

725
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:10,392
Sorry.

726
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,494
Burned myself.

727
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,404
Bobbi?

728
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,673
That wouldn't happen to be short

729
00:37:24,741 --> 00:37:26,342
for Barbara, would it?

730
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:28,477
As a matter of fact, it is.

731
00:37:28,545 --> 00:37:29,611
How did you know?

732
00:37:43,226 --> 00:37:46,795
Okay, if you have something to tell me,

733
00:37:46,863 --> 00:37:49,698
You're going to have
to figure out a way to tell me.

734
00:37:56,373 --> 00:37:58,507
Miss Scarlet,

735
00:37:58,575 --> 00:38:00,776
I'm serious.

736
00:38:09,352 --> 00:38:12,788
Oh, eggs.

737
00:38:12,856 --> 00:38:14,957
Thank you again for coming in,
ms. Catalano.

738
00:38:15,024 --> 00:38:17,526
I realize how busy you must be
during this difficult time,

739
00:38:17,594 --> 00:38:19,728
So I'll get right to the point.

740
00:38:19,796 --> 00:38:22,264
There have been some recent developments

741
00:38:22,332 --> 00:38:24,933
In the investigation into
your father's murder.

742
00:38:25,001 --> 00:38:28,570
We now have reason to believe
that he bit his attacker

743
00:38:28,638 --> 00:38:29,738
Before he died.

744
00:38:29,806 --> 00:38:31,140
Really?

745
00:38:31,207 --> 00:38:32,808
All right.

746
00:38:32,876 --> 00:38:34,710
Well, forgive me, mr. Devalos,

747
00:38:34,778 --> 00:38:36,879
But I don't see
how that really qualifies

748
00:38:36,946 --> 00:38:38,480
As a new development.

749
00:38:38,548 --> 00:38:40,482
I don't want to hear all the gory details

750
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,484
About the fight between
my father and that man.

751
00:38:42,552 --> 00:38:43,485
That's the thing.

752
00:38:43,553 --> 00:38:45,487
That man Edgar Kripke...

753
00:38:45,555 --> 00:38:48,457
He doesn't have any bite
marks anywhere on his person,

754
00:38:48,525 --> 00:38:50,259
And as a result,
we're no longer convinced

755
00:38:50,326 --> 00:38:51,760
He's the one who murdered your father.

756
00:38:51,828 --> 00:38:53,128
I don't understand.

757
00:38:53,196 --> 00:38:55,564
He had my father's watch,
he had my father's wallet.

758
00:38:55,632 --> 00:38:57,599
They had argued several times.

759
00:38:57,667 --> 00:39:00,602
Edgar Kripke is an unmedicated
paranoid schizophrenic.

760
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,738
He argued with many people many times.

761
00:39:02,806 --> 00:39:04,139
He never hurt anyone.

762
00:39:04,207 --> 00:39:06,575
Now, as for your father's possessions,

763
00:39:06,643 --> 00:39:09,278
If Kripke was the first person
to find the body,

764
00:39:09,345 --> 00:39:11,113
Maybe he stole them

765
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:12,748
Or maybe they were planted.

766
00:39:13,783 --> 00:39:16,985
Planted, really?

767
00:39:17,053 --> 00:39:19,555
Who would have wanted
to do that and why?

768
00:39:19,622 --> 00:39:20,722
We're not entirely sure,

769
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,925
But now that Kripke's
guilt is in question

770
00:39:22,992 --> 00:39:24,960
And because there are no other suspects,

771
00:39:25,028 --> 00:39:27,029
We are going to reopen the investigation.

772
00:39:27,096 --> 00:39:28,730
If that's what you need to do...

773
00:39:28,798 --> 00:39:30,032
Typically,

774
00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:32,534
We begin with the last person
who saw the victim alive

775
00:39:32,602 --> 00:39:34,403
So we can rule them out as a suspect.

776
00:39:34,471 --> 00:39:37,739
In this case that person is you.

777
00:39:37,807 --> 00:39:40,108
So, if you don't mind,

778
00:39:40,176 --> 00:39:41,109
We'd like you to submit yourself

779
00:39:41,177 --> 00:39:42,811
To a brief physical examination.

780
00:39:42,879 --> 00:39:46,148
If the female officer doesn't
find any bite marks on you,

781
00:39:46,216 --> 00:39:48,150
Then we can refocus our energy elsewhere.

782
00:39:48,218 --> 00:39:49,718
You're joking.

783
00:39:49,786 --> 00:39:50,819
I beg your pardon?

784
00:39:50,887 --> 00:39:52,321
I loved my father.

785
00:39:52,388 --> 00:39:54,289
I would never hurt him.

786
00:39:54,357 --> 00:39:55,724
If he knew how you were treating

787
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:56,992
A member of his family,

788
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,728
After everything that he has
done for this department...

789
00:39:59,796 --> 00:40:01,763
Are you aware that your business
has taken out

790
00:40:01,831 --> 00:40:03,365
No less than five separate loans

791
00:40:03,433 --> 00:40:05,167
From the bank over the past few years?

792
00:40:05,235 --> 00:40:07,870
Do you read the papers, mr. Detective?

793
00:40:07,937 --> 00:40:10,172
The economy is not what it used to be.

794
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,174
And yes, people are still dying,

795
00:40:12,242 --> 00:40:14,510
But their survivors are
not spending the money.

796
00:40:14,577 --> 00:40:15,611
Now, what is your point?

797
00:40:15,678 --> 00:40:17,880
I also called a few of your suppliers.

798
00:40:17,947 --> 00:40:19,348
If business is down,

799
00:40:19,415 --> 00:40:21,717
Maybe you could explain to me why,
over the past year or so,

800
00:40:21,784 --> 00:40:23,986
You ordered three times
more embalming fluid

801
00:40:24,053 --> 00:40:25,454
Than in previous years.

802
00:40:25,522 --> 00:40:28,290
Are you aware that
embalming fluid is a mixture

803
00:40:28,358 --> 00:40:31,493
Of ethanol, methanol, and formaldehyde...

804
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:33,462
The ingredients in the drug wet?

805
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:34,763
I did not know that.

806
00:40:34,831 --> 00:40:36,131
We've been curious how
our local drug dealers

807
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:39,902
Have been able to put
so much out on the street.

808
00:40:39,969 --> 00:40:41,703
You care to venture any theories

809
00:40:41,771 --> 00:40:44,006
I wouldn't know where to begin.

810
00:40:44,073 --> 00:40:46,742
Your father figured out
what you were doing.

811
00:40:46,809 --> 00:40:49,311
He confronted you.

812
00:40:49,379 --> 00:40:50,546
There was a struggle.

813
00:40:50,613 --> 00:40:52,047
He bit you

814
00:40:52,115 --> 00:40:54,983
On your right calf.

815
00:40:55,051 --> 00:40:57,286
I, for one, appreciate
everything your father did

816
00:40:57,353 --> 00:40:59,821
To help the men and women
that serve this city.

817
00:40:59,889 --> 00:41:02,591
That's why, provided
you enter a guilty plea

818
00:41:02,659 --> 00:41:04,293
And make a full confession,

819
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,627
I'm prepared to discuss a deal

820
00:41:05,695 --> 00:41:07,696
With whoever you hire to represent you,

821
00:41:07,764 --> 00:41:09,531
Or if you insist on
doing it the hard way,

822
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,568
I'll simply have detective
Scanlon here arrest you,

823
00:41:12,635 --> 00:41:15,003
And once your calf has been
examined for a bite mark,

824
00:41:15,071 --> 00:41:18,140
Well, then... Then your fate will lie

825
00:41:18,207 --> 00:41:20,642
In the hands of the jury.

826
00:41:25,281 --> 00:41:30,052
He asked me to meet him
at my mother's grave.

827
00:41:32,221 --> 00:41:34,790
And he told me that
he knew everything.

828
00:41:37,594 --> 00:41:39,728
He said my mama

829
00:41:39,796 --> 00:41:43,165
Would have been ashamed of me.

830
00:41:46,169 --> 00:41:48,670
<i>Those are all eggs ?</i>

831
00:41:48,738 --> 00:41:50,105
Yep.

832
00:41:50,173 --> 00:41:51,740
Did you know that a tarantula can lay

833
00:41:51,808 --> 00:41:53,542
Up to 2,000 eggs at a time?

834
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:54,543
They're not going

835
00:41:54,611 --> 00:41:56,478
To hatch here, are they?

836
00:41:56,546 --> 00:41:58,580
No, probably not.

837
00:41:58,648 --> 00:42:00,749
I called miss Colletto
as soon as I found them,

838
00:42:00,817 --> 00:42:01,984
And she says that she's going

839
00:42:02,051 --> 00:42:03,619
To take 'em to the pet store tomorrow

840
00:42:03,686 --> 00:42:05,687
And make sure they all get good homes.

841
00:42:05,755 --> 00:42:07,222
It's what miss Scarlet
would have wanted.

842
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:12,861
You two ready
for a little trick-or-treating?

843
00:42:12,929 --> 00:42:15,964
Okay, you're a witch,
I get that, but dad,

844
00:42:16,032 --> 00:42:17,466
What are you supposed to be?

845
00:42:17,533 --> 00:42:18,934
I'm a nerd.

846
00:42:19,002 --> 00:42:21,003
Ariel, honey,
we're going to see you later.

847
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,404
We're taking off.

848
00:42:22,472 --> 00:42:23,639
Hold on!

849
00:42:30,513 --> 00:42:32,114
It was from right over there.

850
00:42:32,181 --> 00:42:33,949
Just promise me we won't go anywhere

851
00:42:34,017 --> 00:42:36,051
Where we might see someone I know.

852
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:37,753
We'll try not to.

853
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,221
Hey, are those my boots?

854
00:42:39,288 --> 00:42:42,991
Did anyone remember
to turn off the tv?

855
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:45,627
You used to really get scared here.

856
00:42:46,696 --> 00:42:49,231
You're still afraid.

857
00:42:49,298 --> 00:42:51,333
Stop it now, I mean it.

858
00:42:51,401 --> 00:42:54,870
They're coming to get you, Allison.

859
00:42:54,937 --> 00:42:55,904
Stop it, you're ig...

860
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:02,911
They're coming to get you, Barbara.

861
00:43:02,979 --> 00:43:06,014
Yeah, that's what I thought you said.
