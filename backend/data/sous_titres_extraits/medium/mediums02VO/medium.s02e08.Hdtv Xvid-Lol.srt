1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,300
Everyone likes to guess.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:03,700
Heads or tails?

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,800
Tails or heads?

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,300
Go ahead, try it.

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,600
Chances are you'll be right at least half the time.

6
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,700
Will it be a boy or a girl?

7
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,400
Everyone thinks they know--

8
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,800
and chances are good at least half the people will be right.

9
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,600
The candidate you want?

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,200
Or the other guy?

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,300
Nice to see you, Bud.
Appreciate your support.

12
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,200
Nice to see you, Mike.

13
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,100
Good choice, Mike.

14
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,700
I know I can count on you,
Allison.

15
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,500
Hey...

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,800
you all right?

17
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,400
What's going on?

18
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,000
Oh, it was nothing.

19
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,500
It was just a bad dream.

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,800
It was just a...

21
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,000
just a normal bad dream.

22
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,400
Just... anxiety about Devalos.

23
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,500
About the election.

24
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,600
Aha. I see.

25
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,200
My wife is suffering from "electile" dysfunction.

26
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,000
Now that's scary.

27
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,200
I'm voting for Mommy's boss.
Are you voting for Mommy's boss?

28
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
What are you talking about?
You can't vote.

29
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,400
Yes I can; I can do whatever I want to.

30
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,000
Mommy says I can do anything,

31
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,800
if I put my mind to it.

32
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,600
This has nothing to do with Mommy.

33
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,900
You're not old enough.
It's against the law.

34
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,500
What do you mean "against the law"?

35
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,200
Are you old enough?

36
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,800
Duh! I can't even drive yet.

37
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,800
Okay, look, this is how it works:

38
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,500
When you're 16, you get to drive and see R-rated movies.

39
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,200
When you're 18, you get to go to college and vote,

40
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,600
and at 21,

41
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,500
you get to drink and do whatever you want.

42
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Says who?

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,600
Sorry, but there'll be no drinking, driving,

44
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,800
and nobody in this family is going anywhere
until you girls learn how to make your beds

45
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,100
and do your own laundry.

46
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,200
But that stuff is hard!

47
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,600
Tell me about it.

48
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,100
Wow!
Look at all this stuff!

49
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,600
All stuffed and ready to go.

50
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,400
Did anybody remember to get a sitter?

51
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,100
Uh, I don't know.
Anybody?

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,900
Marie, did you remember to get a sitter?

53
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,900
Are you guys going out tonight?

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,600
Yep.

55
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,300
It turns out the temperature in Hades has finally plummeted below zero,

56
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,900
and your mother and I are going to go out and we're going to see a movie

57
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,900
and maybe we're gonna get some dinner-- alone.

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
With just each other.

59
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,700
Wow.

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,100
Everybody's gonna think I have a little workshop of elves working for me.

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,900
Hey, look at this:

62
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,300
There's a special sneak preview tonight of Memoirs of a Geisha.

63
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,000
Didn't you like that book?

64
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,100
Yeah, I really liked it.
We should try to get in.

65
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,500
What's a geisha?

66
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,900
Ask your mother.

67
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,300
What's a geisha?

68
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,000
What's a geisha?

69
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,900
Well, things are going to be a little different under my watch,
Mr. Mayor.

70
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,900
Yeah, trust me.

71
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,200
I'm not afraid to knock a few heads from time to time.

72
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,900
Yeah, you can count on me.

73
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,500
Allison...

74
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:34,900
What's the matter?

75
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,800
No... nothing.

76
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm well aware that, traditionally,
the candidates only debate once,

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,600
but why not give the voters a second chance to decide? Hmm?

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,600
I mean, you can't have too much democracy.

79
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,800
Oh, come off it, Nate.

80
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,800
We'll be lucky to fill the damn hall
for one debate, much less two;

81
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,900
quit grandstanding.

82
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,200
There are no cameras here.

83
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,200
All right,
Mr. District Attorney.

84
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,700
Have it your way.
I get it.

85
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,800
You're ahead in the polls.

86
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,000
You don't see any up-side to debating me more than once,

87
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,000
but, remember,

88
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,100
things can change very quickly in politics.

89
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,900
A young woman is raped and murdered in her own home.

90
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,800
Just this week, this man,

91
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,700
Clyde Morton,

92
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,900
was arrested in connection with the attack--

93
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,100
the same Clyde Morton who was arrested for breaking into an elderly

94
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,600
couple's home with a firearm,

95
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,400
just three years ago.

96
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,600
Why wasn't this dangerous criminal behind bars?

97
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,300
Why did an innocent woman have to die?

98
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,500
Because District Attorney Manuel Devalos

99
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,400
refused to prosecute
to the full extent of the law.

100
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,800
Isn't it time Phoenix had a prosecutor tough enough to do the job?

101
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,200
Vote Nathan Bradley: new blood,

102
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,500
new breed, solid values.

103
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,800
Paid for by the Committee to Elect Nathan Bradley.

104
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,300
Clyde Morton?

105
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,200
What are you talking about?
He's a scared kid.

106
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,000
At least he was three or four years ago.

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,400
Yeah. Thank you.

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,500
Yeah, that's him.

109
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,100
He was arrested for breaking and entering--
14, maybe 15 years old.

110
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,900
Remanded to juvenile detention.

111
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,300
Is he out yet?

112
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,500
Should be.

113
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
About a month ago.

114
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,100
I remember the mayor made a big stink about this.

115
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,200
Wanted me to try him as an adult.

116
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,100
He was carrying this ancient weapon, with one bullet--

117
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,700
in his pocket, as I recall.

118
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,600
The bullet wasn't even in the gun.

119
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,600
And according to the old man and old woman whose apartment he broke into

120
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,300
the gun never came out of his pocket.

121
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,200
Now, what in the world does this have to do with my opponent?

122
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,400
Apparently, sometime between now and the election,

123
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,400
Clyde Morton is going to rape and murder a young woman here in Phoenix.

124
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,400
And you know this...?

125
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,300
I saw an ad that your opponent is going to air after it happens.

126
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,600
I mean, I saw it in my head.

127
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
And I saw Bradley.

128
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,400
I saw him here.

129
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,500
Right where you are,
behind your desk.

130
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,100
We have to find a way to stop this,

131
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,400
save this woman's life.

132
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,000
Bradley is going to use this against you.

133
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,600
So what are we gonna do?

134
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,800
I don't think there's anything to do.

135
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,900
I can't protect the victim.
We don't know who she is.

136
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,400
And I can't very well arrest Clyde Morton for a crime he's yet to commit.

137
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,200
Well, I know that, but can't we send
someone there to keep an eye on him?

138
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,300
Can't we send the police to his house,

139
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,000
let him know that he's being watched?

140
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,100
I could give his parole officer a call.

141
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,100
Well, I don't think that's going to do it.

142
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,700
Well, give me a name of the victim,

143
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,300
or at least a description.

144
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,500
I'll put her under round-the-clock protection.

145
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,500
I don't have it.

146
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,600
Well, then, I don't know what to tell you, Allison.

147
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,700
I could've tried this kid as an adult,

148
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,300
locked him up for a long, long time,

149
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,400
but my gut told me not to do it.

150
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,100
My gut told me that he just made a stupid mistake.

151
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,700
That he's basically a decent kid who could use a second chance.

152
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,500
And now you're telling me that he's gonna kill somebody?

153
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,700
Considering that I don't have a lot of options,

154
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,000
I hope you understand when I say that I'm hoping...

155
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,500
with all my heart...

156
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,600
that you're wrong.

157
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,700
Two for Memoirs of a Geisha, please.

158
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,300
Uh, is that the line to go inside?

159
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,500
Okay. Thank you.

160
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,600
Thank you.

161
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,000
So, what'll it be?
Food? Call the kids?

162
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,000
- Little of both?
- Candy.

163
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,500
Oh, my God! Joe?!

164
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,200
Joe Dubois?

165
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,600
Karen!

166
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,500
- Karen, I don't believe it...
- Joe.

167
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,600
I thought I heard you lived in Phoenix.

168
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,200
Hey. What are you doing here?

169
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,000
This sure beats physics.

170
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,100
This is physics.

171
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,200
Everything is physics.

172
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,500
Well, Steve's folks live here. Steve?

173
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,300
This is my husband Steve.

174
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,600
This is an old friend from grad school,

175
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,600
Joe Dubois.

176
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,100
Uh, hi.

177
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,100
Allison--
This is my wife Allison.

178
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,100
This is Karen Jane.

179
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,300
Herzfeld now.

180
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Karen Herzfeld.

181
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,600
Um...

182
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,400
Wow, we were research fellows in grad school,

183
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,700
many moons ago.

184
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,400
Well, not that many moons ago.

185
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,500
Well, nice to meet you,
"research fellow".

186
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Nice to meet you,
research fellow's husband.

187
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,100
Research fellow's wife.

188
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,400
So what have you been up to?

189
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,000
Me? Well, I've been up to kids.

190
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,000
And dogs,

191
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,300
and this guy,

192
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,200
and our real estate business.

193
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,400
Real estate. Wow.
Well, who'd-a thunk it?

194
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,000
And you are the chairman of what physics program at what university?

195
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,600
Oh, well,
none of the above.

196
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,300
I'm a project engineer at Aerodytech.

197
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,600
Okay.
I can see that.

198
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,700
So what are you guys here to see?

199
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,700
Uh, the, uh, the geisha movie.

200
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,600
Oh, we just got out.
You're gonna love it.

201
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,900
Well, good.

202
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,200
Oh, wow, okay,
look, that's us.

203
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,300
God, it was great to see you.

204
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,300
You, too.

205
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,000
We should all get together.

206
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,800
We should.
Yes, absolutely.

207
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,400
I'll call you at your office.

208
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Oh, yeah.
Absolutely.

209
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,100
- Do that.
- Okay then.

210
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,900
Okay.

211
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,900
So nice to meet you,
Allison.

212
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,800
Nice to meet you.

213
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,500
She's pretty.

214
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,900
That's how you get to be a geisha.

215
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,700
No, I meant Karen.

216
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,100
Oh, yeah. I guess.

217
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,400
I don't think I remember you mentioning her before.

218
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,900
We had a seminar together for, like, one semester.

219
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,500
I think after that,
she transferred away or something.

220
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,000
Man, for a second there,
I almost couldn't remember her name.

221
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,800
Do you think she noticed,
or did I cover okay?

222
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,900
Oh, no, you cover great.

223
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,500
Hang onto that one.

224
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,000
Oh, damn, I left the window open this morning.

225
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,500
The cat's going to have gotten out.

226
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,600
Me? I'm hanging in.

227
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,700
No, nobody yet.

228
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm just not ready to get back out there, you know?

229
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,600
Titu? Where are you?

230
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,200
Besides, I have a cat.

231
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,900
Or at least I had a cat.

232
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,900
Titu?

233
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,500
Titu?

234
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,300
Oh! He must have gotten out.

235
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,800
It's all right.

236
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,400
He'll come back when he's hungry.

237
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,800
Is that your other line?

238
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,700
All right. Talk to you later.

239
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,100
Bye.

240
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,000
Titu? Where are you hiding?

241
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,000
Titu?

242
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,400
Titu! Hey!

243
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,700
Good morning.

244
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,600
Hey, what's going on?

245
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,700
You looking for another movie?

246
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,400
Yeah, I was just hoping we could run into more old girlfriends.

247
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,700
Okay...

248
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,900
Is there something you want to talk to me about?

249
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
I don't know--
is there something you want to talk to me about?

250
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,200
Are you still mad about last night?

251
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,000
I run into an old friend,
an old married friend.

252
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,000
What is the big deal?

253
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,700
Is she in the paper or something?

254
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,300
I had a dream last night.

255
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,400
I saw this woman.
She came home from work.

256
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,200
There was a stranger in her house. He...

257
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,500
I just thought...

258
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,400
Maybe it happened last night.
Maybe it's in the paper.

259
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,100
And this woman was Karen?

260
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,400
You know what? Forget it.
Forget about that.

261
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,600
I'm just a little thrown,
that's all.

262
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,800
I can see that.

263
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,200
You want to tell me why?

264
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,400
I don't know.

265
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,900
I guess I thought I knew about everyone.

266
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,400
I guess I thought that we told each other everything.

267
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,800
We have. We did.

268
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,800
Well, clearly,
you left someone out!

269
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,100
I don't think so.

270
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,600
You know what?

271
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,300
Remember who you're talking to and try that one again.

272
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,200
You know what?

273
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,000
I have no idea what conversation I'm in.

274
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,600
- Fine.
- Fine.

275
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,400
"This is physics.

276
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,800
Everything is physics".

277
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,500
Oh, look, it's all coming back to him.

278
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,600
Oh, man.

279
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,200
I understand.
There were so many back then.

280
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,500
Who could keep track?

281
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,200
Allison, come on.

282
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,100
It was 15 years ago.

283
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,000
It only happened once and we were very drunk.

284
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,500
But it did happen!

285
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,300
I forgot, okay?

286
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Hell, she and I never even talked about it.

287
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,400
We just pretended it never happened.

288
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:50,000
It was one of those things where we both knew
it was a bad idea the second it was over.

289
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,800
Well, it didn't look that way to me.

290
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,000
You are really overreacting.

291
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,000
Oh, really?

292
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,300
How would you feel if you had a porno movie starring me playing in your head?

293
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,700
You mean, you saw it?

294
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,100
Trust me. It's not something I sought out.

295
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,000
It's not like I saw it in the TV Guide and put it on my must-see list.

296
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,700
It just popped into my head.

297
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,000
You're kidding me.

298
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,200
That is so not fair, Allison.

299
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,100
Not only is that not fair,

300
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,200
it is creepy.

301
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,500
You have no right to get inside my head like that.

302
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,300
Wait a second.

303
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,900
What makes you think I got it out of your head?

304
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,600
Maybe I pulled it out of her head.

305
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,400
This is an absurd conversation.

306
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,700
Maybe she didn't forget about it.

307
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,700
Maybe she didn't think it was a mistake the minute after it was over.

308
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,900
Do you hear yourself?

309
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You're railing at me for something that happened
before I met you that I never think about,

310
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,000
that I actually forgot about.

311
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,700
And what are you yelling at me for?

312
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,300
I have no control over what goes on inside her head!

313
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Besides, it's 15 years ago!

314
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,000
What are you going to say when she calls?

315
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,900
What are you talking about?
She's not going to call.

316
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,800
Yeah, she is.

317
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,600
No, she was just being polite.

318
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,900
She wants something from you,
I can tell.

319
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,100
Wants something?

320
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,300
I guess you didn't notice the significant other she had on her arm.

321
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,600
I didn't mean she wants another physics lesson!

322
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,000
Allison...

323
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,200
Joe Dubois.

324
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,600
Joe, hey. Uh, it's your old physics buddy, Karen.

325
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,400
Karen?

326
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,500
Karen, hi.

327
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,700
Hi. You didn't think I was going to call, did you?

328
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,200
Uh, actually, no, I didn't.

329
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,600
Surprise.

330
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,700
Surprise.

331
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,600
Look, I know you're busy. Um...

332
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,000
No, I'm good.

333
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,300
You sure?
'Cause...

334
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,100
The thing is...

335
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,800
I need to talk to you about something.

336
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,200
Sure.

337
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,800
But I'd really rather do it in person.

338
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:48,800
Uh-huh.

339
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,500
But I like it there.

340
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,100
It's weird.

341
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Daddy, tell her she has to take it down.

342
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,100
Have you noticed the eyes seem to follow you no matter where you're standing?

343
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,900
Not funny.

344
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,400
Daddy...

345
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,200
Hey.

346
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,000
Half this room belongs to your sister and she likes it there,

347
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,100
and I like it, too.

348
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,600
Mommy's right.

349
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,400
Nothing wrong with a little political awareness.

350
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,600
Yeah!

351
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,900
You don't even know what he's talking about.

352
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,300
You just like the colors.

353
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,600
Ariel, sweetie, we'll figure it out in the morning, okay?

354
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,500
Okay.

355
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,100
Sleep tight.

356
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,900
You, too, Mommy.

357
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,000
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

358
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,200
Night.

359
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,000
Good night.

360
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,000
Good night.

361
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,100
So he's counting on you to be wrong?

362
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,600
That's his plan?

363
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,100
Apparently.

364
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,800
He's right. There's nothing he can do.

365
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,400
I didn't give him any information he can use.

366
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,800
I am wrong from time to time.

367
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,000
Okay, stop.

368
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,600
Who are you, and what have you done with my wife?

369
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,400
No, I'm serious. He's right.

370
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,400
I misinterpret things...

371
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,900
I overreact.

372
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,300
Sometimes I see smoke where there's no fire.

373
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,100
I'm sorry.
What are we talking about?

374
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,900
Politics.

375
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,300
Old girlfriends.

376
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
I'm sorry if I overreacted.

377
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,800
To be fair,

378
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,400
if I found a bunch of dirty pictures of you and an ex,

379
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,300
I think I'd probably be walking around with a dark cloud over my head, too.

380
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,900
And besides,

381
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,200
if it makes you feel any better,

382
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,600
you weren't completely wrong.

383
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,500
She did call today.

384
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,800
Oh, yeah, what did she want?

385
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,200
Lunch, Thursday.

386
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,200
Really? Just the two of you?

387
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,300
Hey, relax.

388
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,900
There's no smoke, there's no fire,
no combustion of any kind.

389
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,000
I invited her to join me in the cafeteria.

390
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,100
Just me and a lunchroom full of my closest colleagues.

391
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,800
Good thinking, Lincoln.

392
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,500
We aim to please, Louise.

393
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,300
You the new valet?

394
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,300
I need a favor.

395
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,800
I've never done this pre-emptive crime-fighting thing before.

396
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,100
Do I at least get one of those flying motorcycles like Tom Cruise had?

397
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,600
Oh, absolutely.

398
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,200
It'll be waiting for you when you return to City Hall.

399
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,800
You sure you're comfortable with this?

400
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,400
Stopping by the kid's house,
letting him know we're watching,

401
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,400
Keep an eye on him?
I'm okay with that.

402
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,000
especially if you think it's gonna make a difference for Manny.

403
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,700
I think it might save a life.

404
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,300
I mean, I know it's not the way it's normally done,

405
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,700
and I... I know it's kind of wrong.

406
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,500
He doesn't know, you know.

407
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:54,900
Who's that?

408
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,900
Devalos. He doesn't know we're doing this.

409
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,500
I think he'd be upset if he did.

410
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,100
All the more reason not to tell him.

411
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,900
Can I help you?

412
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,200
My name is Lee Scanlon.

413
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,200
I'm a detective with the Phoenix Police Department.

414
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,100
We were hoping to talk with Clyde Morton.

415
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,600
I'm his mother.

416
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,500
He's not in right now.

417
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,700
He's out looking for a job.

418
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,500
Something the matter?
Is he in trouble?

419
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,200
We were just hoping to speak with him.

420
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,200
You don't look like police.

421
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,100
Actually, I work with the D.A's office.

422
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,000
Oh.

423
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,600
Well, I hope he wins, your boss.

424
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,500
He's smart,

425
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,200
and I think he cares.

426
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,300
He could've sent my boy away for years and years,
instead, he exhibited some mercy,

427
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,400
something you don't see much of around here--

428
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,100
Mercy.

429
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,700
Well, that's sort of why we're here, actually.

430
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,100
Make sure that he's okay.

431
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,500
We wouldn't want to see him get himself into any kind of trouble.

432
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,200
I thought that's what the probation officer was for.

433
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,100
You can tell whoever needs to know,

434
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,100
my son doesn't go around looking for trouble anymore.

435
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,400
That's behind him now.

436
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,300
Glad to hear it,

437
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,200
ma'am, but we'd like to talk to him just the same.

438
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,300
Any idea when he's gonna be home?

439
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,400
Been getting in late.

440
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,700
Uh, I think he found himself a girl.

441
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,500
There's no law against that now, is there?

442
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,100
No, ma'am.

443
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,400
If you'd just tell him we dropped by.

444
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,300
Let him know we'll check back.

445
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,700
Well, that felt horrible.

446
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,800
All this Minority Report stuff's not all that it's cracked up to be,

447
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,900
but if it makes you feel better,

448
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,600
Jeffrey Dahmer's mother thought that he was a saint, too.

449
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,500
Clyde?

450
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,700
Clyde Morton?

451
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,500
Stay here.

452
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,500
Hey!

453
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,200
Hey!

454
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,200
They're saying he's got swelling on the brain.

455
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,900
Could be a couple of days before they know if he's going to make it or not.

456
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,300
So what happened?
Why did he run?

457
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,100
I don't know.

458
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,300
We couldn't find anything on him.

459
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,100
Maybe just panic 'cause he figured me for a cop.

460
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,100
It was an accident.

461
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:20,800
It was a...

462
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,800
stupid, horrible awful accident.

463
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,800
You wouldn't happen to know the definition of "accident" would you, Allison?

464
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,200
I-I'm sorry, I meant the car part.

465
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,200
An accident,
by definition is a chance event.

466
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
So am I to simply assume that it was by chance that you

467
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,300
and Detective Scanlon went over to Clyde Morton's house?

468
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,700
Despite the fact that you and I had already discussed it?

469
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,100
Despite the fact that I'd already made it abundantly clear that it is not

470
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,000
the policy of this office to harass citizens based on the possibility

471
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,400
that they might commit illegal acts?

472
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,900
I asked you a question!

473
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,200
Hey, back off. We went there to help you.

474
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,100
Help me?

475
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,900
By violating this man's rights?

476
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,600
By putting him in the hospital?

477
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,100
By using the name of this office?

478
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,400
Thanks, Lee.
thanks for your help.

479
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,100
I'm sorry.

480
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,100
We apologize.

481
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,700
We weren't driving that car.

482
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,100
Right.

483
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,400
Right.

484
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,400
Get me the name of the physician attending Clyde Morton.

485
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,800
See if I can speak with him, please.

486
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,200
I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

487
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,300
Don't apologize to me

488
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,000
I'm not the one lying in a hospital bed fighting for his life.

489
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,100
Yeah, go.

490
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,700
I'm trying to locate that doctor and you're ten minutes late for court.

491
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,700
Thank you both very much.

492
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,100
I'll take care of this from here.

493
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,100
Night, honey.

494
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,000
Good night, Daddy.

495
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,200
Good night.

496
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,900
Isn't Mommy going to say good night?

497
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,300
She's going to sneak in later,
when you're asleep.

498
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,200
Well, then, how will I know she did it?

499
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,800
You trust your mom don't you?

500
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,400
I guess.

501
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,500
Tell her that maybe I'll sneak in later while she's asleep

502
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,800
and kiss her good night, too.

503
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,700
I will definitely let her know.

504
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
You still waiting?

505
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,500
Hi. Yes.

506
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,300
I'm calling regarding the condition of Clyde Morton.

507
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,200
Thank you. Thank you.

508
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,500
He's still in I.C.U.

509
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,300
Okay.

510
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,700
How do you feel?

511
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,300
Does it, matter?

512
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,700
It matters to me.

513
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,100
Awful.

514
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,500
Sad.

515
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,100
Guilty.

516
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,300
Confused.

517
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,800
I'll go say good night to the girls.

518
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,300
Okay.

519
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,700
Love you.

520
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,600
Nah, didn't make it to the gym,

521
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,000
had to do something after work.

522
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,500
Nothing, I'm fine.

523
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,900
Just a little beat, that's all.

524
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,400
No.

525
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,200
Damn.

526
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,900
I left the window open this morning.

527
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,800
The cat's gonna have gotten out.

528
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,200
Really. I'm fine.

529
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,300
Something happened to somebody I know and I'm kinda bummed about it.

530
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,600
Titu!

531
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,900
Where are you?

532
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,400
Titu!

533
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,000
Can I just tell you about it some other time?

534
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,700
I just want to take a shower,
watch TV, and veg.

535
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,400
Titu?

536
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,100
Here, boy.

537
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,600
Okay. I'll talk to you tomorrow.

538
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,400
You, too. Bye.

539
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,000
Scanlon.

540
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,600
Hi.
It's Allison.

541
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,000
Clyde Morton's out of I.C.U.

542
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,700
Great. I'll be sure and send him a card.

543
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,200
I want to talk to him.

544
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,500
What for? He's obviously not gonna hurt anyone now,

545
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,600
not in the near term, anyway.

546
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,300
I had that dream again last night.

547
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,700
Same woman, same everything.

548
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,200
- A little different clothes, but other than that...
- Allison.

549
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,500
He might know something.
He might be able to shed some light.

550
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,300
You know your boss,
my old friend,

551
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,800
practically had an aneurysm yesterday.

552
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,900
I need to find somebody to look after my kids,

553
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,600
I don't think I can be there till late afternoon.

554
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,400
Do you just not hear "no"?

555
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,800
You want to say 5:00?

556
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,400
- Hey, you.
- Hello.

557
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,000
Thanks for coming all this way.

558
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,200
Well, thank you for seeing me.
I know you're very busy.

559
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,100
No. You said it's important.

560
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,600
So, what's good here?

561
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,500
Nothing. The chairs.

562
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,500
It's close. Hi.

563
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,500
Mr. Dubois.

564
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,400
Thank you.

565
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,500
Ah, you like fish?

566
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,500
Yeah.

567
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,500
Two... whatever the fish is today, two of those.

568
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,700
And you still like iced tea?

569
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,000
I do.

570
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,100
And two of those,
too, please.

571
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:54,900
Thanks.

572
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,300
So.

573
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,000
Were you as stunned as I was that we ran into each other the other night?

574
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,700
Yeah, I was pretty stunned.

575
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,300
She's lovely, your wife.

576
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,100
Thank you. She came to me that way, actually.

577
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,400
I had nothing to do with it.

578
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,200
Steve seems nice.

579
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,900
He is. Nice. Very.

580
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,100
Do you believe in fate?

581
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,800
It's funny you should say that.

582
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,900
I didn't used to,

583
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,000
but since I got out of school...

584
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,400
well, since I've been married, really...

585
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,600
Well, here's the thing.

586
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:36,300
For the past few years or so I, I've had this, um...

587
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,800
It's like a hollow inside me,

588
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,700
and I've been trying to figure out how to fill it.

589
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,000
what it is and what to do with it,

590
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,100
and just last week I realized what it was.

591
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,700
I'm smart.

592
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,500
Not that Steve isn't, but...

593
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,000
You know, selling houses.

594
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,700
I don't know.

595
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,300
It's not quantum physics.

596
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,300
It's not any type of physics.

597
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,100
So now you're supposed to say, "Everything's physics".

598
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,200
Everything's physics.

599
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,800
Anyway, then I ran into you,
that's the fate part.

600
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,800
You lost me, Karen.

601
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,700
I want to start working again.

602
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,500
I want to be an engineer, I want to use...

603
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,900
my head for something more than calculating mortgage rates.

604
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,100
Aha.

605
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,400
Steve and I are thinking of moving the business here.

606
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,900
His parents are getting older.

607
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,400
He'd like to be closer.

608
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,100
Sure.

609
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,500
Funny thing is...

610
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,000
There happens to be a job opening

611
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,700
at your company that I think I might be right for.

612
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,600
Oh, really? Wow.

613
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,100
That's, um, that's great.

614
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,100
So, um...

615
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,800
I was hoping, as long as you're comfortable with it,

616
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,700
you'd put in a good word for me.

617
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,000
Assistant vice-president of systems sales and marketing.

618
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,300
It says here that they're looking for a masters in engineering.

619
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,700
I know, and I never get mine.

620
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,800
which is stupid because I have a1most all the credits,

621
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,100
but I was kind of hoping that my experience in business would make up for it.

622
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,700
And,

623
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,000
well, your going to bat for me.

624
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,600
Right. Um...

625
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,600
The thing is, they're looking for somebody with a masters.

626
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,800
I know, but...

627
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,300
Clients want to feel like they're dealing with someone who

628
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,200
understands what it is that we're selling.

629
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,900
I get that, I do,

630
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,800
but I'm a closer, Joe.

631
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,200
You get me in that room,

632
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,300
and I will show them that I have the perfect résumé for this job.

633
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,700
Look, um...

634
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,900
I know how management thinks around here.

635
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,700
If they say they're looking for a certain degree,

636
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,600
you got to walk in that room with that diploma.

637
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,600
It's that simple.

638
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,000
But even if someone like you weighs in on my behalf,

639
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,700
don't you think they'll meet me?

640
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,500
I don't know.

641
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,200
Isn't it at least worth a try?

642
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,200
I mean...how fantastic would that be,

643
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,300
working together again,

644
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,800
rubbing elbows,

645
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,500
pulling all-nighters.

646
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,700
What are you doing, Karen?

647
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,800
I'm closing, Joe.

648
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,200
I'm closing...

649
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,000
Well, stop.

650
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:20,300
Look, I am flattered by your proposal, both proposals,

651
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,800
but frankly, you're not qualified for either position.

652
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,700
The first one is clearly way above your head educationally,

653
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,600
and the second one is permanently filled
by someone who knows more about physics

654
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,000
than you and me combined.

655
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,300
Enjoy your fish.

656
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,900
Mr. Morton?

657
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
It's Allison Dubois from the district attorney's office.

658
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:09,900
May I come in?

659
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,500
Sure, I guess.

660
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,700
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you had a visitor.

661
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,600
Can I help you?

662
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,500
If you're here about the accident,
somebody already spoke with him.

663
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,500
No, no, no, that's not why I'm here.

664
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,700
I'm not here to take a statement, really. I...

665
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,500
I wanted to ask you a question.

666
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,000
I'm sorry, you are...?

667
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,500
Catherine Croshaw.

668
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,200
I'm Mr. Morton's case advisor at the employment office.

669
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,100
Have we met before?

670
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,400
No, not exactly.

671
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,100
I can come back.

672
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,100
That's okay. I only have about five minutes left on my parking meter.

673
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,400
Yeah, you'd better get home and feed that cat.

674
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,000
Clyde...

675
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,000
Cathy,

676
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,400
come on,
enough of that.

677
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,700
This woman doesn't care about our business.

678
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,800
I just woke up from a coma.

679
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,700
Damn, girl, get over here and give me a proper kiss.

680
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,800
I love you.

681
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,000
I love you, too.

682
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,500
Call me when you get home from the gym.

683
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,300
Mm, think I'll skip the gym today.

684
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,900
I just want to take a shower.

685
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,800
- See ya.
- Nice to meet you.

686
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,800
She seems nice.

687
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:47,000
Yeah. She's going through a, uh, tough time right now.

688
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,600
The guy she's divorcing is crazy.

689
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,400
Nuts.

690
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I'm sorry.

691
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,100
Yeah, he's one of those...

692
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,800
Hey.

693
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,200
Oh, no, get-get him out of here!

694
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,300
- Nurse!
- What's the problem? Did I do something?

695
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,900
Get him out of here!

696
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,900
He's the reason I'm in this hospital, okay?

697
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,800
Nurse!

698
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,900
- He's a police officer.
- Get him out of here, all right.

699
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,000
- I'm supposed to be safe in here!
- This is Detective Lee Scanlon.

700
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,100
- What?
- He's with me.

701
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,900
You're not Cathy's ex?

702
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,400
I'm not anybody's ex and damn proud of it.

703
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,300
Wait a second.
Who did you think he was?

704
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,400
You were never married to Cathy?

705
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,000
Is that the lady I just passed in the hall?

706
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,500
I don't even know who Cathy is.

707
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,800
Is that why you took off on me yesterday?
You thought I was...

708
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,500
her husband?

709
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,800
Her ex-husband.

710
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,900
He put her in the hospital last year.

711
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,400
I'm sorry.
I guess I was wrong.

712
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,400
He told me that he knew where I lived and that he's been driving by my house.

713
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,300
Can I talk to you outside?

714
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,800
It wasn't Clyde.
It was never going to be Clyde.

715
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,000
What was never going to be Clyde?

716
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,600
He was never gonna to kill her.
He was just gonna be accused of it.

717
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:03,800
Okay.

718
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,300
His fingerprints,
his DNA is probably all over her house.

719
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,300
They would have found her body,
looked at his record,

720
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,000
figured it was an open and shut case.

721
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,100
What was an open and shut case?

722
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,500
- Her murder.
- Whose murder?

723
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,300
Cathy.

724
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,000
The Cathy I just saw walking down the hall?

725
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,200
I hate to be the bearer of good news,
but she's not dead.

726
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,700
No, but she was going to be before Clyde got hit.

727
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,500
- But now she's not...
- No.

728
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,000
Yes.

729
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,300
Oh, my God, she was wearing the same clothes that she was wearing in my dream.

730
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,300
It's tonight.

731
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,000
Lee,

732
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,700
it's gonna happen tonight.

733
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,300
No, I didn't make it to the gym.

734
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,900
I had to do something after work.

735
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,400
Nothing. I'm fine.

736
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,500
Just a little beat, that's all.

737
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,400
No.

738
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,700
Damn, I left the window open this morning.

739
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,300
The cat's gonna have gotten out.

740
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,900
Really, I'm fine.

741
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,000
It's just,

742
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,800
something happened today to somebody that I'm kind of bummed out about.

743
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,400
Titu? Here, boy.

744
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,400
Titu?

745
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,200
I'll tell you some other time,
okay?

746
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,500
I just want to take a shower,

747
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,000
watch TV and veg.

748
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,300
Titu.

749
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,100
Titu?

750
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,000
I'll call you in the morning, okay?

751
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,500
You, too.

752
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,300
Bye.

753
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,800
You ever play rock, scissors,
and paper, Mr. Croshaw?

754
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,800
This is just like that,

755
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,800
except it's called knife,
gun...

756
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,700
You're dead.

757
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,700
Mommy!

758
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,800
It's him!

759
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,900
Who?

760
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,000
Him!

761
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,500
Hello?

762
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,800
Good morning.

763
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,100
Good morning,
Mr. District Attorney.

764
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,900
"Mr. District Attorney"?
Wow, that bad, huh?

765
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,400
Well, I guess you had every reason to be angry.

766
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:13,800
Did I?

767
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:19,600
Turns out you saved the woman's life
and kept an innocent man from going to jail.

768
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,200
So does that mean I ought to send out my résumé?

769
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,000
Allison, as long as I have a job, you have a job.

770
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,900
By the way, you wouldn't have
any inside information on that, would you?

771
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,200
Sir, clearly I'm not the person to ask.

772
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,700
I am the one who saw Bradley standing behind your desk,

773
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,900
but well...

774
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,200
for what it's worth,
I do have a good feeling about tomorrow.

775
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,000
Me, too.

776
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,800
Things are gonna be different under my watch, Mr. Mayor.

777
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,200
Trust me.

778
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,100
I'm not afraid to knock a few heads from time to time.

779
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:58,800
No, I'm just... I just stopped Manny Devalos' heart, I think.

780
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,800
No, it's his office I'm in.

781
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,900
He's the only guy around here working at this hour.

782
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,400
So, when I realized that I'd forgotten my keys and my cell phone,

783
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,600
I almost locked out of my office.

784
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,800
I didn't know who else to ask for help.

785
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,400
So thank you for running them over here,

786
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,000
and I will be standing in the lobby. Yeah.

787
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,800
wife.

788
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And...

789
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,300
She thinks I ought to concede as well.

790
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,300
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

791
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,300
If it were me,
I'd ride it out.

792
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,900
As a wise man once said,

793
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,600
"You can't have too much democracy".

794
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,000
Thank you, Manuel.

795
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,100
I will see you on TV tomorrow.

796
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,500
You, too.

797
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,600
Hey, listen,

798
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,800
if you see an exterminator looking lost out there will you point him this way?

799
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,700
He's supposed to do a big number on my office today.

800
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,700
Consider it done.

801
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,600
Oh, my gosh, with everything on,
I completely forgot to ask you.

802
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,700
How was your lunch yesterday?

803
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,400
Didn't happen.

804
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,000
What? You're kidding!
She stood you up?

805
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,400
Actually, uh...

806
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,500
I did the standing up.

807
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,500
You did?

808
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,200
You did?

809
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,900
I don't know.

810
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,300
What's the point of going out for a 
hamburger when you have steak at home?

811
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,600
I'm taking the kids to school.
I'll call you from work.

812
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,500
That's so funny.
I was sure you'd ordered the fish.

813
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:55,800
