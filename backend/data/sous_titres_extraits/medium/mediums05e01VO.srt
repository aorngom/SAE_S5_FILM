the governer,
they all want me to step in.

4
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:09,441
They gave him his job back.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,650
That's amazing.

6
00:00:12,648 --> 00:00:15,973
- That means that you get your job back?
- As soon as I want.

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,072
- Who's that?
- Terry Cavanaugh.

The John D. Rockefeller

I bought your invention.

He said, "do it in Phoenix".

12
00:00:28,426 --> 00:00:30,736
Find some space, hire some people.

00:00:31,427 --> 00:00:32,877

<i>Those who knew Phineas' best</i>

35
00:01:58,557 --> 00:02:01,428

00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,939
<i>Once even-keeled and hardworking,</i>

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,710

39
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:13,200
<i>that Phineas,

00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:16,173
<i>once identified himself

41
00:02:16,298 --> 00:02:17,962
<i>as "Cyrus Ames"?</i>

42
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,218
<i>Who, you ask, was Cyrus Ames?</i>

43
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:25,740
<i>Cyrus Ames was a notorious
gunfighter and card cheat.</i>

44
00:02:26,154 --> 00:02:28,651
<i>For a time, he was employed
by the railroads</i>

45
00:02:28,776 --> 00:02:32,305
<i>to shoot any Indians who attempted
to interfere with the construction.</i>

46
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:35,059
<i>On the day of Phineas' accident,</i>

47
00:02:35,309 --> 00:02:37,926
<i>Cyrus Ames lay dying of syphilis</i>

48
00:02:38,094 --> 00:02:41,594
<i>in the very same doctor's office
where Phineas was treated.</i>

49
00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:43,575
<i>Some believe</i>

50
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,675
<i>that an exchange of sorts
took place that day.</i>

51
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,175
<i>That the soul of a dying gunfighter</i>

52
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,146
<i>somehow slipped into the body
of an injured railroad worker.</i>

53
00:02:53,926 --> 00:02:56,611
<i>Coincidence?

54
00:02:57,448 --> 00:02:59,007

Bad dream?

59
00:03:16,852 --> 00:03:17,852
Bad rerun.

60
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,400
It was weird, I dreamt
about an old TV show.

61
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:28,175
You mean no one's in danger?
You don't have to call anyone?

62
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,250
We can just go back to sleep?

63
00:03:32,218 --> 00:03:33,587
I don't believe it.

00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:05,663
Allison, you're here. Good.

67
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:08,891
Once settled, join me and Lee
for a meeting, please?

68
00:05:09,374 --> 00:05:10,392
With him?

69
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,680
With them.

70
00:05:15,037 --> 00:05:17,287
Lee, Allison, this is Joel Tiernan.

71
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,587
And sitting beside him is my old
friend, his wife, Gabrielle.

72
00:05:22,724 --> 00:05:25,813
Six months ago, Gabrielle's sister,
Robin, was found murdered

73
00:05:25,938 --> 00:05:27,993
in a cottage she'd rented
on Saguaro Lake.

74
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,747
There were no witnesses
and as of now,

75
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,553
no suspects.

76
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,375
This all took place when D.A.
Van Dyke was running this office.

77
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,507
His people worked the case
but never solved it.

78
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:44,564
I believe it was...

79
00:05:45,323 --> 00:05:46,398
August 16th

80
00:05:46,523 --> 00:05:48,097
when I first realized that

81
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,475
the Phoenix police
department had given up

82
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,783
on trying to find
my sister's killer.

83
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,675
I had called district attorney
Van Dyke for an update,

84
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,800
and...

85
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:01,508
he told me there were
no new developments in the case.

86
00:06:01,633 --> 00:06:04,975
When I asked him when I might
expect any new developments,

87
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,233
he was kind enough to explain to me

88
00:06:07,358 --> 00:06:10,077
that good police work
depends on good leads.

89
00:06:10,407 --> 00:06:13,357
And since there were
no new leads in the case...

90
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,502
Six months ago, there was nothing
I could do about that.

91
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,630
Now I can.

92
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,350
That's why I'm putting
my two best people on it.

93
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,586
I'm going to tell her everything.

94
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,375
What did you just say?

95
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,650
You heard me.

96
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,917
I'm going to tell her everything.

97
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:49,533
I think I saw his face.

98
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,495
- What are you talking about?
- The killer, I think I saw his face.

99
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,191
Put me together
with a sketch artist,

100
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:59,585
we might have something for you
to work with this afternoon.

101
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,289
Hey, kiddo.
How was school?

102
00:07:07,838 --> 00:07:09,238
Why the long face?

103
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,514
I sort of got
in trouble in art class.

104
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,389
Oh, yeah?
What happened?

105
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,611
I kind of drew a funny picture
of my teacher,

106
00:07:19,015 --> 00:07:20,022
Mr. Enright.

107
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,524
Did you apologize?

108
00:07:22,872 --> 00:07:25,557
Well, yeah, but he wants you and mom

109
00:07:25,682 --> 00:07:28,845
to look at the picture
anyways and sign it

110
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,170
- so he knows you saw it.
- Okay.

111
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,814
Bridgette, you drew this?

112
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:41,464
That man is naked.

113
00:07:42,405 --> 00:07:43,710
He sure is.

114
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,633
This is the man you
believe murdered Robin Aaronson?

115
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:49,927
I think it's a pretty good likeness.

116
00:08:01,142 --> 00:08:03,292
Tell me, is this the man you saw?

117
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,110
Yes. Absolutely.

118
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,801
- You know this man?
- I knew him.

119
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:13,492
Gabrielle's first husband, Nathan.
He was a very successful novelist,

120
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,937
and when he died, he left
Gabrielle a very wealthy woman.

121
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:19,477
He's dead?

122
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:23,363
Killed in a car crash two years ago,
driving home from a writers' retreat.

123
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,850
Struck head-on by another
vehicle, a stolen vehicle.

124
00:08:27,264 --> 00:08:29,223
By the time the accident
site was discovered,

125
00:08:29,348 --> 00:08:31,375
the other driver, the car thief,
had disappeared.

126
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,075
Skulked off into the night.

127
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,583
We never managed to identify him.

128
00:08:36,848 --> 00:08:39,580
I'm sorry, Allison. I don't know
what you think you saw,

129
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,772
Nathan's dead for two years,
he couldn't have killed 6 months ago.

130
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,389
Look on the bright side. At least
this woman wasn't in the room

131
00:08:49,514 --> 00:08:52,125
when you accused her dead
husband of murdering her sister.

132
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,777
Would you put that
thing away already?

133
00:08:54,983 --> 00:08:56,900
I'm sorry.
It's just so...

134
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,300
Accurate?

135
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:03,400
Yeah, I mean I know
we've had the talk with Bridgette,

136
00:09:03,905 --> 00:09:06,879
And I know she's seen all this stuff
in science class, but it's just...

137
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:08,298
But what?

138
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,009
You're acting like you never drew
a picture of a naked person before.

139
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,675
I'm sure that I scribbled

140
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,014
the occasional "bazoom" in my notebook,
but nothing like this.

141
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,775
What? A young boy's fascination
with "bazooms" is okay?

142
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,229
But a young girl's curiosity
about that, isn't?

143
00:09:25,826 --> 00:09:27,875
I'm just going to turn off
the light now.

144
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,429
Yeah, you do that.

145
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,990
So, you're telling me
Joel Tiernan did this?

146
00:10:18,866 --> 00:10:21,275
Joel Tiernan, Gabrielle Tiernan's
current husband,

147
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,826
is the hit-and-run driver

148
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:25,801
who killed her first husband,
Nathan Cafferty?

149
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,670
That is one very forgiving lady.

150
00:10:29,932 --> 00:10:31,875
Obviously, I don't think she knows.

151
00:10:32,115 --> 00:10:33,115
Obviously.

152
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:37,799
Look, I know how this sounds, Lee,
but I dreamt about it last night.

153
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,639
Joel Tiernan was the other driver
in that accident.

154
00:10:40,764 --> 00:10:43,267
I think that's how he got
that big scar on his forehead.

155
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,075
What?!

156
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,308
I'm sorry, it's just Manny
puts us on one cold case,

157
00:10:48,433 --> 00:10:50,800
and you start dreaming about
another that's even colder.

158
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,858
You may see
who took the Lindbergh baby.

159
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:56,029
What if i'm right? What if Joel
Tiernan is responsible for this?

160
00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:00,475
If you're sure about what you saw,

161
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,900
and when I say "sure," I'm talking
in the neighborhood of 100 percent,

162
00:11:05,826 --> 00:11:07,593
then I'll bring the guy in
for questioning,

163
00:11:07,718 --> 00:11:09,468
ask him to account
for his whereabouts.

164
00:11:09,593 --> 00:11:11,093
But if you're not...

165
00:11:12,063 --> 00:11:15,227
Remember, these are Manny's friends.
At least the wife is.

166
00:11:15,997 --> 00:11:19,052
If you're right about this Tiernan guy,
Gabrielle sure can pick them.

167
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,179
- What do you mean?
- I interviewed a few

168
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,323
of the dead sister's friends
yesterday.

169
00:11:24,448 --> 00:11:27,227
One of them told me about a little
accident Robin had in '06.

170
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,875
She claimed she'd fallen, but the friend
spotted some bruising around her neck.

171
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,961
Got the feeling she may have
been covering for someone.

172
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,180
An abusive boyfriend, maybe.

173
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,720
Turns out she was.

174
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,367
And his name was Nathan Cafferty.

175
00:11:44,348 --> 00:11:46,913
She was having an affair
with her sister's husband?

176
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,213
For about a year until Nathan decided
he was still in love with Gabrielle.

177
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:53,530
According to the friend,
Robin didn't take it well.

178
00:11:53,655 --> 00:11:55,500
Threatened to tell her sister.

179
00:11:56,164 --> 00:11:57,675
Nathan got physical.

180
00:11:57,882 --> 00:12:00,844
Grabbed Robin by the neck,
threw her up against the wall.

181
00:12:03,364 --> 00:12:05,600
It happened in the same cabin
she died in.

182
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,175
I saw it, Lee.
I saw it yesterday.

183
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,011
I just didn't understand.
So, so, wait...

184
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,513
so, if Robin was having
an affair with Nathan,

185
00:12:13,638 --> 00:12:16,985
shouldn't we bring in Gabrielle for
questioning? She has the motive.

186
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,525
If she knew her sister was getting it on
with her husband, sure.

187
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,864
But according to the friend,
she never found out.

188
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,713
Besides, I did some checking. There are
photos of her at some charity event

189
00:12:26,838 --> 00:12:29,500
in Flagstaff till the wee hours
on the night of the murder.

190
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,475
Plus, she's the one that came
to us for help, remember?

191
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,875
It wouldn't make much sense to
reheat a case that'd gone cold

192
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,423
if you were the killer,
now, would it?

193
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,764
Hey, it's me.

194
00:12:41,397 --> 00:12:44,554
I got a call from Bridgette's school.
They want us to come in today at 3:00

195
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,175
<i>to meet with her art teacher
and a school counselor.</i>

196
00:12:49,176 --> 00:12:51,326
I teach art, Mr. And Mrs. Dubois.

197
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,450
I'm not a prudish man,
and if I were teaching

198
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:57,074
a life drawing class
to a group of college students,

199
00:12:57,199 --> 00:12:59,100
I might be inclined
to laugh this off,

200
00:12:59,551 --> 00:13:00,737
but the fact is,

201
00:13:01,235 --> 00:13:03,875
Bridgette is a ten-year-old
in a fourth grade art class,

202
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,400
and this is the second time
in two days she's drawn

203
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,330
a vivid portrait of me...
Her teacher.

204
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,050
I don't know what to say,
Mr. Enright.

205
00:13:13,248 --> 00:13:16,753
This obviously is inappropriate,
and we're very sorry.

206
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:19,530
I appreciate that.
And please understand, she's one

207
00:13:19,655 --> 00:13:22,475
of the most imaginative students
I've ever had the pleasure to teach.

208
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,052
I adore having her in the class,

209
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,707
but I'd be lying

210
00:13:25,832 --> 00:13:28,987
if I said the last couple of days
haven't been disturbing to me.

211
00:13:29,112 --> 00:13:32,414
So, that's why I asked
Mrs. Tharp to sit in with us.

212
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,075
Mr. Enright and I thought
that perhaps Bridgette

213
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,691
could use the benefit of
a few sessions with me.

214
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,800
You think that Bridgette
needs to see a psychologist?

215
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,905
- Because of this?
- The drawings are rather graphic.

216
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,200
We just wanted to find out where
Bridgette got the impulse to make them.

217
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,975
To see if she's been exposed
to anything that could have

218
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,291
caused this preoccupation
with the naked form.

219
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,275
Wait a second. She hasn't
been exposed to anything,

220
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,400
and this is not a preoccupation.
It's just a kid using her imagination.

221
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,060
Bridgette needs a lesson
in what's appropriate and not.

222
00:14:05,185 --> 00:14:07,220
She doesn't need to go to therapy.

223
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,012
With all due respect,

224
00:14:09,137 --> 00:14:11,600
you're not the subject
of the drawings, Mr. Dubois. I am.

225
00:14:12,138 --> 00:14:14,143
I'm not sure
I agree with your assessment.

226
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:17,217
I'm not sure that you know my daughter
as well as you think, Mr. Enright.

227
00:14:17,342 --> 00:14:18,356
Mrs. Tharp,

228
00:14:19,117 --> 00:14:22,675
we do appreciate your offer, I think
we'll to speak with Bridgette ourselves

229
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,800
before we take you up on that.

230
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:26,659
Mr. Enright,

231
00:14:27,258 --> 00:14:29,701
I am sorry
for any kind of discomfort

232
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,829
or embarrassment that our daughter
may have caused you.

233
00:14:33,151 --> 00:14:35,485
We'll make sure we speak
with Bridgette and let her know

234
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,875
that these kinds of drawings
in school are not appropriate.

235
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,050
Absolutely.

236
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,813
And I promise you this
will never happen again.

237
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,700
Hi, kiddo.
How you doing?

238
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:52,825
Okay.

239
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,775
I'm sorry.

240
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,750
Hey, it's okay, sweetie.
We're not mad at you.

241
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:01,757
But you need to stop drawing
pictures of your teacher.

242
00:15:01,882 --> 00:15:03,443
It's making him uncomfortable.

243
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,405
Well, I didn't want to draw
another picture of Mr. Enright.

244
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:09,866
I just felt like I had to.

245
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,100
- What do you mean, you had to?
- I don't know.

246
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,586
When I close my eyes,
I see him in my head.

247
00:15:17,222 --> 00:15:20,372
And I just know that I have
to put it down on paper.

248
00:15:22,698 --> 00:15:24,630
Maybe Vridgette's not
the problem here.

249
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:26,829
Maybe it's that teacher
we should be worried about.

250
00:15:26,954 --> 00:15:29,175
What are you saying?
This is Mr. Enright's fault?

251
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,802
I don't know. All I know is
that she goes in his class,

252
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:34,515
and then she feels like she has to
draw him without his clothes on.

253
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,975
Why? What's going on
in this guy's head?

254
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,645
What kind of, I don't know,
energy is bridgette picking up on?

255
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,190
What are you saying? Mr. Enright's
putting in some kind of "naked energy"?

256
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,475
I don't know but we should talk
to the school,

257
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,375
and get her transferred
to another class.

258
00:15:48,571 --> 00:15:50,375
Okay, good luck
with that conversation.

259
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,783
You'd better make sure that
you have your facts straight.

260
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:55,900
If you're going to accuse somebody
of putting out a "naked vibe,"

261
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,998
make sure you have
all your ducks in a row.

262
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,083
How you can just dismiss this?

263
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,375
I'm not. It'll pass, Joe.

264
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,675
I asked Bridgette specifically,

265
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,631
"did anything inappropriate happen?"

266
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,929
"Anything at all that made you feel
uncomfortable?" She said no.

267
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:12,675
It'll pass.
Whatever it is that's making her

268
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,350
want to draw these pictures,
It'll pass.

269
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,275
If we make a huge thing of this,

270
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,354
we're just going to make Bridgette
more confused than she already is.

271
00:16:23,664 --> 00:16:25,422
All right, you got me thinking.

272
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,319
I just took a look at our files
on Nathan Cafferty's accident.

273
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,979
<i>Unfortunately, it turns out
the city destroyed both cars</i>

274
00:16:31,104 --> 00:16:32,375
<i>about a year ago.</i>

275
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,077
<i>We won't find any DNA to help us figure
out who was driving that other car,</i>

276
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,645
but I did find one
interesting thing.

277
00:16:39,348 --> 00:16:41,357
Turns out our friend
Joel has a record.

278
00:16:41,482 --> 00:16:44,601
Arrested in '02 for car theft,
and again in '04 for check-kiting.

279
00:16:45,042 --> 00:16:47,714
Although how that proves he killed
Nathan Cafferty, I've no idea.

280
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,875
What about the papers?
Maybe you should check the papers.

281
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,100
What papers?

282
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,375
The papers from the accident scene.
They were everywhere.

283
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,061
There were hundreds of them.
I saw Joel touch one of them.

284
00:16:58,186 --> 00:17:01,353
If they're in the evidence locker,
we should check them for fingerprints.

285
00:17:01,698 --> 00:17:04,675
I'm looking at the report right here,
and there's no mention of any papers.

286
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,517
It's just two cars
and one dead body.

287
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,195
I think you're focusing
on the wrong case.

288
00:17:11,001 --> 00:17:14,282
<i>Our boss asked us to help solve
the murder of his friend's sister,</i>

289
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,775
you're trying to prove her husband
committed manslaughter.

290
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,828
You should just stick
to the case at hand.

291
00:17:19,227 --> 00:17:20,627
Just a suggestion.

292
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:24,300
Tell me about the first time
we made love.

293
00:17:24,551 --> 00:17:26,900
We were staying at
your parents' house.

294
00:17:27,257 --> 00:17:29,857
You snuck into the guest room
to join me.

295
00:17:31,366 --> 00:17:33,677
You were worried
about getting caught.

296
00:17:34,566 --> 00:17:36,866
But then you fell asleep in my arms.

297
00:17:37,664 --> 00:17:39,864
Your mom woke us up in the morning

298
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,650
but she didn't seem that mad.

299
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,475
How did we celebrate when
you sold your first novel?

300
00:17:51,673 --> 00:17:55,323
We booked a presidential suite
at a resort we couldn't afford,

301
00:17:56,029 --> 00:17:58,579
and we ordered room
service all weekend.

302
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,300
I was...

303
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,472
I had a difficult year.

304
00:18:07,597 --> 00:18:09,597
I was going through something.

305
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,630
The miscarriage.

306
00:18:13,098 --> 00:18:16,398
You were almost three months along.
No one knew but us.

307
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,500
We were just about to share
the good news with our parents.

308
00:18:21,407 --> 00:18:23,017
We even had names picked out.

309
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,644
Courtney if it was a girl.

310
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,300
Peter if it was a boy.

311
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:34,779
When you called me, I just...

312
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,050
I just couldn't believe that anything
you were saying could be true,

313
00:18:41,973 --> 00:18:44,912
that there was any chance you could
be who you said you were,

314
00:18:45,037 --> 00:18:46,437
that there was any...

315
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,050
possibility that...

316
00:18:49,913 --> 00:18:52,380
- we could be together again.
- It's me, Gabby.

317
00:18:53,252 --> 00:18:54,352
It's Nathan.

318
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,300
I've come back to you,

319
00:18:56,547 --> 00:18:59,179
and I promise,
I'm never going to leave you again.

320
00:19:07,502 --> 00:19:08,520
Mrs. Dubois.

321
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,191
Hi, I'm sorry. I know it's early,
I didn't call first.

322
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,675
No, no, it's fine.

323
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,736
What's on your mind?

324
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,167
The night before I met you,
I had a dream that,

325
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,142
that I couldn't understand.

326
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,450
It was about a man
who died a long time ago.

327
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,248
Only instead of
his soul crossing over,

328
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,334
it made its way into this other man.

329
00:19:33,845 --> 00:19:36,045
Well, I guess that's why i'm here.

330
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,475
The more I come to learn
about your family,

331
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,818
the more sense
this dream starts to make.

332
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,551
After Nathan's accident,
there were days

333
00:19:46,676 --> 00:19:48,575
I didn't know how I'd carry on,

334
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,600
or if I even could carry on.

335
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,442
But then, just when
I was ready to give up...

336
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,778
Joel Tiernan appeared?

337
00:19:57,175 --> 00:20:00,142
Imagine losing the love
of your life,

338
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:02,175
but then before you'd even begun

339
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,452
to start mourning the loss,
getting him back.

340
00:20:05,223 --> 00:20:08,413
Being spared the lifetime it would've
taken to get over that loss.

341
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,582
It was...

342
00:20:11,074 --> 00:20:12,424
it was a miracle.

343
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,475
Nothing short of a miracle,

344
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,714
surely you, of all people,
can appreciate that.

345
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,480
Did Nathan ever talk to you about what
happened the night of the accident?

346
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,473
He ever told you how exactly he might
have crossed paths with Joel Tiernan?

347
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,100
No, no. All he remembers was
the screeching of tires.

348
00:20:30,246 --> 00:20:31,696
Nothing after that.

349
00:20:32,414 --> 00:20:36,418
And in regards to Joel Tiernan, neither
one of us remembered ever meeting him.

350
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,975
We tried to investigate
his life after the switch,

351
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,600
but as it turned out, there wasn't
much of a life to investigate.

352
00:20:43,862 --> 00:20:44,862
No family,

353
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,300
no friends to notice Joel
behaving differently.

354
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,424
I can only imagine what a comfort
it must've been to have your husband,

355
00:20:52,579 --> 00:20:54,629
your real husband, by your side,

356
00:20:54,923 --> 00:20:56,838
when you got the news
of Robin's death.

357
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,049
Actually, I was by myself
when I got the news.

358
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,343
I'd gone to an event that night.
Joel couldn't go,

359
00:21:03,676 --> 00:21:06,700
and so we didn't see each other
until much later...

360
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,500
but it was difficult for Joel, too.

361
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,786
I think he loved her
as much as I did.

362
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:17,675
Bridge! I heard a rumor
you weren't dressed yet.

363
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,300
Just leave me alone!

364
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,197
Come on, come on.
It's getting late.

365
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:24,657
I'm sorry, daddy.

366
00:21:26,357 --> 00:21:28,563
What are you sorry about, honey?
What's the matter?

367
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:31,390
I know I wasn't supposed to...

368
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,626
but I couldn't stop.

369
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,175
Joel Tiernan

370
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,429
is Nathan Cafferty.
That's what you're telling me?

371
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,222
I know how this sounds.

372
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:50,850
No, I don't think you do.
It sounds insane, Allison.

373
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,317
You are telling me that the essence

374
00:21:53,442 --> 00:21:55,475
of my friend's dead husband somehow

375
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,812
found its way into the body of that man,
Joel Tiernan, and that therefore,

376
00:21:58,937 --> 00:22:01,860
we should question Joel Tiernan
for the murder of Gabrielle's sister?

377
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,207
They were having an affair.
She threatened to tell.

378
00:22:04,332 --> 00:22:06,740
With who? On whom
was she threatening to tell?

379
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:10,161
- They're one and the same.
- I think that's a tough sell to a jury.

380
00:22:10,572 --> 00:22:13,475
Sir, I am telling you,
Joel tiernan was driving the car

381
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,000
that killed Nathan Cafferty
that night.

382
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,573
Joel and Nathan were
within yards of each other

383
00:22:18,698 --> 00:22:20,375
when Nathan's soul left his body,

384
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,975
but instead of going wherever
it was supposed to go...

385
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,775
It did what?
It just made its way

386
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,775
to the nearest warm body
and took up residence.

387
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,806
- Is that really what you think?
- I know that's what his wife thinks.

388
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,852
Can't we just bring him in here
and ask him

389
00:22:35,977 --> 00:22:38,600
where he was the night
his sister-in-law died?

390
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,140
- You mean no one asked him that?
- No one has asked him anything.

391
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,029
No one thought it mattered.

392
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,951
In the past 24 hours, a theory
of evidence has emerged.

393
00:22:50,206 --> 00:22:53,475
It's unconventional, to be
sure, but I was just curious

394
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,999
as to whether you might
have a point of view about it.

395
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,875
Mrs. Tiernan, Gabrielle,

396
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,170
recently spoke
with Mrs. Dubois here and...

397
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,089
shared some very interesting things

398
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:08,011
about the nature of you and your
wife's... mutual attraction.

399
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,100
My wife...

400
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,520
my wife is very spiritual.

401
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,950
She has some rather romantic
ideas about life and death.

402
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:26,645
I'm not sure she's...

403
00:23:27,104 --> 00:23:29,324
entirely over the loss
of her first husband.

404
00:23:30,155 --> 00:23:32,705
I suppose, inevitably,
appearance aside,

405
00:23:33,015 --> 00:23:36,265
I have some things,
some traits in common with Nathan,

406
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,350
and I'm sure Gabrielle...

407
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,700
interprets those similarities,

408
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,270
well, with a...

409
00:23:42,767 --> 00:23:44,130
a romantic's heart,

410
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,450
a romantic's sensibility.

411
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,469
I hope you don't think
too badly of her.

412
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,030
It's one of the reasons
i love her so.

413
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,311
- Anything else?
- There is one more thing.

414
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,565
Do you happen to remember where you were
the night that Robin was murdered?

415
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,114
Of course. At home.

416
00:24:06,527 --> 00:24:07,627
In bed sick.

417
00:24:08,976 --> 00:24:10,726
Gabrielle had this...

418
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,055
charity thing, really wanted me
to go with her

419
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:16,120
and meet some of her friends,
but I just couldn't get out of bed.

420
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,575
Then she got that horrible news...

421
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,811
and we weren't even together,

422
00:24:22,604 --> 00:24:24,800
and, I mean, we're always together.

423
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,341
Was anyone else home that night?
A cook, a maid?

424
00:24:31,733 --> 00:24:33,283
Would that be a "no"?

425
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,950
Yes, that's a "no."

426
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,400
Are you heading where
I think you're heading?

427
00:24:39,525 --> 00:24:42,275
I barely knew Robin.
I just barely married her sister.

428
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,690
Why in the world would I want
to do her any harm?

429
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,175
On the morning
after Robin was murdered,

430
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,700
the police found a...
a spot of blood

431
00:24:50,749 --> 00:24:53,159
- At the crime scene that wasn't hers.
- Yes, I know.

432
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:55,201
It was in all the papers. So?

433
00:24:55,804 --> 00:24:58,121
So we were wondering if you'd mind
giving us a blood sample.

434
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:02,324
It would enable us
to rule you out, Mr. Tiernan.

435
00:25:03,403 --> 00:25:06,275
Actually, i'm embarrassed that
this wasn't attended to earlier.

436
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,000
It's a simple request

437
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,975
and I would infer nothing from it
other than it would allow us

438
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,575
to do our due diligence, and...

439
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,805
we could look your wife in the eye and
tell her we have left no stone unturned.

440
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,800
So, Mr. Tiernan, can detective
Scanlon take you downstairs?

441
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,980
Is that a "no"?

442
00:25:24,579 --> 00:25:26,029
Yes, that's a "no."

443
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:29,969
I will not participate
in this farce.

444
00:25:30,723 --> 00:25:32,675
I will not have my privacy invaded

445
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,675
so you people can grasp at straws,

446
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,176
and most importantly,

447
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:38,575
I will not put my wife
through the embarrassment

448
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,955
and the humiliation and the pain

449
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,775
of knowing that her please
for help in this matter

450
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,200
have yielded nothing but the most...

451
00:25:46,864 --> 00:25:50,454
cynical and simple-minded ideas
about

452
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:53,217
who might be responsible
for her sister's death.

453
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,640
- Is that all?
- You know,

454
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:01,584
I can compel you
to give us that blood.

455
00:26:01,709 --> 00:26:03,159
Well, by all means,

456
00:26:03,284 --> 00:26:04,934
call the family lawyer.

457
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,190
Gabrielle will give you the number.
I'm leaving now.

458
00:26:13,913 --> 00:26:15,992
I let go of the contractor that
we hired to...

459
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:17,675
I'm home! Anyone want chinese?

460
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,800
... build the floor
model for trade shows.

461
00:26:20,389 --> 00:26:24,081
That sounds good. We'll take new bids
in next week. See you in the morning.

462
00:26:24,943 --> 00:26:26,575
Hi. You're back early.

463
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,675
Actually, I worked from home today.

464
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,175
You were in meetings and I needed
to make an executive parental decision,

465
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,176
after I made it, I didn't see the point
of discussing it until you got home.

466
00:26:35,832 --> 00:26:36,928
Discussing what?

467
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:40,636
She was upset, embarrassed, I couldn't
force her to go to school.

468
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:42,575
What, you couldn't bring yourself?

469
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,573
You weren't here. You didn't see her.
She said she couldn't help herself.

470
00:26:46,698 --> 00:26:50,429
Now, I think we should just keep her
away from school 'til this thing passes.

471
00:26:50,554 --> 00:26:53,076
- You want her to miss more school?
- As a matter of fact, I do.

472
00:26:53,201 --> 00:26:56,197
I mean, people do it all the time.
Kids get sick, they stay home.

473
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,150
But she's not sick.
She's not sick, Joe.

474
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,245
This is happening for a reason. She's
drawing these pictures for a reason.

475
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,832
She can't just miss school
'cause we don't know what it is.

476
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,050
What if we never figure it out?

477
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,090
- Wait a second. What is this?
- What's what?

478
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:15,794
I don't know. This spot.

479
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,569
On Mr. Enright's chest.

480
00:27:18,829 --> 00:27:21,420
I don't know. It's his,
you know, his nipple.

481
00:27:21,636 --> 00:27:24,436
No, I don't think so.
Look, there's only one.

482
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,000
And look, it's on all these.

483
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:30,175
She drew it on every single picture.

484
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,449
Is it growing? It looks like
it's just changing shape.

485
00:27:33,574 --> 00:27:35,900
Look, this one's like
a little circle,

486
00:27:36,025 --> 00:27:38,225
and then here it looks like an x.

487
00:27:40,338 --> 00:27:42,938
Maybe she's not just
drawing Mr. Enright.

488
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,550
Maybe she's diagnosing him.

00:28:38,469 --> 00:28:40,307
"we had little in common, but faith,

504
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,310
"as it has often been said,
is feminine.

505
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,765
"Even the cynic
who believes in nothing

506
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,700
"can find a girl
who believes in him."

507
00:29:11,728 --> 00:29:12,875
I was wrong.

508
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,475
Tiernan isn't walking around with
the soul of Cafferty inside of him.

509
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,382
He's walking around
with Nathan Cafferty's autobiography.

510
00:29:20,042 --> 00:29:21,932
- I beg your pardon?
- Remember I told you

511
00:29:22,057 --> 00:29:25,375
that I saw pages raining down from
the sky the night of the car wreck?

512
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,200
I think that's what it was.
It was Nathan Cafferty's autobiography.

513
00:29:29,716 --> 00:29:32,375
Joel stole it before
anyone else could read it.

514
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,975
That's how he knew so much about him.
That's how he could convince Gabrielle

515
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,500
that he was him.

516
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,750
He had a...

517
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,779
a virtual manual on how to be him.

518
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,532
I'm sorry. I know I told you
that Joel was Nathan.

519
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,875
I was wrong.

520
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,652
I fell for the same scam
Gabrielle did.

521
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,829
The only thing I don't know

522
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,457
is, if Joel Tiernan
was always Joel Tiernan,

523
00:29:53,998 --> 00:29:56,001
Why would he kill Robin Aaronson?

524
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,504
Maybe because
he didn't kill her, Allison.

525
00:29:58,861 --> 00:29:59,880
What?

526
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,927
Lee brought this in a few
minutes before you arrived.

527
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,855
- Wait a second. Who's this?
- Arthur Kolber.

528
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:09,557
Worked at the cottages where
Robin Aaronson was beaten to death.

529
00:30:10,304 --> 00:30:13,400
I was doing my due diligence on
the hotel staff when I found out

530
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,772
Kolber sexually assaulted
a female friend two months ago.

531
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,875
I had the lab compare his blood
with the drop that we found

532
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,200
at the scene of Robin Aaronson's murder,
and... guess what.

533
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,475
A perfect match.

534
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,992
Kolber claims he cut his hand
doing repairs at the cottage,

535
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,995
but I don't buy it.
I'm pretty sure this is our guy.

536
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,200
Wait a second.

537
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,814
Even if he didn't kill Robin,

538
00:30:35,939 --> 00:30:39,919
what about everything he's done
to Gabrielle. Can't we get him on that?

539
00:30:40,152 --> 00:30:41,152
On what?

540
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,566
Gabrielle is a full-grown woman.
If she wants to believe she's married

541
00:30:44,691 --> 00:30:48,012
to the ghost of her dead husband,
well, there's no law against that.

542
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,675
On the other hand,
I'd be lying if I said

543
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,589
that I didn't think that Joel
Tiernan was hiding something.

544
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,936
But here's the thing, I already owe
the man an apology for accusing him

545
00:30:59,061 --> 00:31:02,787
of killing his sister-in-law.
I can't also accuse him of

546
00:31:03,002 --> 00:31:05,427
perpetrating one of the cruelest
hoaxes I've ever heard of,

547
00:31:05,552 --> 00:31:06,975
especially without proof.

548
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,992
You... don't have any proof, do you?

549
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,993
Yeah, well. Me neither.

550
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,123
I'm sorry. I don't get it.
Your daughter has done

551
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,575
maybe a dozen more
explicit drawings of me,

552
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,921
And you want to talk to me
about this dot?

553
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:25,966
I'm not so sure that it is just a dot.
I think that maybe it's a mole.

554
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,377
All right, a mole. So?

555
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,870
So... do you?

556
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,369
Do you have a mole on your chest?

557
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:39,700
One that's, you know,
in roughly the same spot as these?

558
00:31:39,825 --> 00:31:43,275
You know what? I don't really know.
I've got quite a few. Most adults do.

559
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,900
I know,
but I'm talking about this one.

560
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:48,875
You see how it's changing
shape in the pictures?

561
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,750
See, it's, like, growing?

562
00:31:52,017 --> 00:31:55,831
I don't mean to alarm you, but I think
that you might want to see a doctor.

563
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,500
Mr. Dubois, with all due respect
to your daughter, these are doodles.

564
00:32:01,405 --> 00:32:04,139
Now, are you seriously suggesting
that I have myself

565
00:32:04,264 --> 00:32:05,975
tested for skin cancer

566
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,311
because of your daughter's doodles?

567
00:32:08,835 --> 00:32:10,901
Actually, I am.

568
00:32:13,786 --> 00:32:15,175
Robin, you in there?

569
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,900
The door's open.

570
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I got here as fast as I could.

571
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,850
So why'd you make me drive all
the way out here hust to talk to you?

572
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,350
What is this place?

573
00:32:32,555 --> 00:32:33,555
This?

574
00:32:36,158 --> 00:32:37,558
This is our place.

575
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:41,842
It's so good to see you again, baby.

576
00:32:41,967 --> 00:32:45,045
Robin, what are you doing?
Why are you dressed like that?

577
00:32:46,986 --> 00:32:47,798
Stop!

578
00:32:50,521 --> 00:32:51,718
What's the matter?

579
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,800
I can't do this with you.

580
00:32:54,716 --> 00:32:57,139
I mean, I'm flattered,
don't get me wrong.

581
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,600
But I could never betray
Gabrielle like that.

582
00:33:07,372 --> 00:33:08,522
That's funny.

583
00:33:09,024 --> 00:33:11,446
You never had a problem
with it before, Nathan.

584
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:13,575
What did you just call me?

585
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,577
"Nathan." That's who
you really are, isn't it?

586
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,162
Gabrielle told you.

587
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:22,418
Yeah, she told me.
She told me all about you.

588
00:33:23,766 --> 00:33:26,075
Of course,
if you were really Nathan,

589
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,340
you'd know about our little secret,
wouldn't you?

590
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,801
You'd know that you bought me
this <i>négligée</i>,

591
00:33:33,405 --> 00:33:35,300
and you'd know that this place

592
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,389
is where we used to meet

593
00:33:38,286 --> 00:33:39,436
to make love,

594
00:33:40,339 --> 00:33:41,839
to betray my sister.

595
00:33:43,473 --> 00:33:46,473
But you don't remember
anything about us, do you?

596
00:33:47,146 --> 00:33:48,946
Because you're not Nathan,

597
00:33:49,866 --> 00:33:51,116
you're a fraud.

598
00:33:52,433 --> 00:33:53,475
A parasite.

599
00:33:53,658 --> 00:33:56,220
- Wait a minute. You have it wrong.
- Shut up!

600
00:33:57,203 --> 00:33:59,036
Stop lying.

601
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:05,300
I don't know how you tricked my sister,
but i'll make sure she knows the truth.

602
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,001
I'm gonna tell her everything.

603
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,442
Your sister loves me, Robin.
She's happy.

604
00:34:18,411 --> 00:34:20,307
You should have left us alone.

605
00:34:26,472 --> 00:34:27,622
Mrs. Tiernan?

606
00:34:30,905 --> 00:34:33,008
I was hoping I could speak with you.

607
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,933
I'm not sure we have much
to talk about.

608
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,660
Not unless you're here to apologize for
the way your office treated my husband.

609
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,170
No, that's not why I'm here.

610
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:44,875
Obviously, he didn't write
about the affair

611
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,275
in his autobiography.

612
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,210
That's why Joel didn't know
about it.

613
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,300
So when Robin threatened
to expose him,

614
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,967
He didn't really have a choice but to
kill her or he lose everything.

615
00:34:57,619 --> 00:35:01,575
No, you're wrong. They found another
man's blood at the crime scene.

616
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,810
A man who worked at the hotel,
he told the police he cut his hand.

617
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,600
I can't prove it, but it think
he's being honest with us.

618
00:35:09,189 --> 00:35:11,500
The truth is, I can't prove
any of this.

619
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,550
But you came to us,

620
00:35:14,105 --> 00:35:16,205
you told us you wanted our help.

621
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,875
And I thought you deserved
to hear the truth

622
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,800
even if a jury never does.

623
00:35:22,158 --> 00:35:23,508
Even if it hurts.

624
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,400
Gabrielle,

625
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,700
he's gone.

626
00:35:28,908 --> 00:35:30,814
The man you loved is gone.

627
00:35:32,192 --> 00:35:33,442
And this man...

628
00:35:34,577 --> 00:35:35,577
isn't him.

629
00:35:48,449 --> 00:35:50,200
Gabby, I'm back.

630
00:35:51,206 --> 00:35:52,691
Welcome home, Nathan.

631
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,234
It's okay.

632
00:35:54,983 --> 00:35:57,075
You don't have to pretend
in front of Mrs. Dubois.

633
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,114
She knows who you really are.

634
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,300
What's she doing here?

635
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,741
After all I've been through
with the D.A.'s office,

636
00:36:06,866 --> 00:36:08,623
Why would you let that woman
in our house?

637
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,800
She came here to talk to me,

638
00:36:12,053 --> 00:36:14,000
to tell me some things about you.

639
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,300
Some theories she has about you.

640
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,500
What kind of theories?

641
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,600
Why would you listen to her?

642
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:24,426
We've been together
nearly two years.

643
00:36:24,551 --> 00:36:27,175
What could she possibly tell you
that we don't already know?

644
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,300
Well, that's a great question,
Nathan.

645
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,900
You don't mind if I call you
"Nathan," do you?

646
00:36:33,018 --> 00:36:34,145
You know what?

647
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,900
I was just flipping through
a couple of your books this morning.

648
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,900
They're beautifully written,
Mr. Cafferty.

649
00:36:41,511 --> 00:36:45,111
You really have a way with words
and a very particular style.

650
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,475
You're a wonderful writer.

651
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,600
Thank you.

652
00:36:50,934 --> 00:36:54,850
Anyway, I know this is gonna
sound like a strange request,

653
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:57,725
but we were wondering if...

654
00:36:58,528 --> 00:37:00,200
maybe we could get you

655
00:37:00,325 --> 00:37:02,450
to sit here and write something,

656
00:37:02,886 --> 00:37:04,555
right here, right now.

657
00:37:05,658 --> 00:37:07,266
Now, why would i want to do that?

658
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,400
Well, why wouldn't you want
to do it?

659
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,950
You know, it's, it's funny.

660
00:37:15,563 --> 00:37:18,763
In the two years since
you first walked in that door,

661
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,350
I haven't seen you do
a single stitch of work.

662
00:37:22,648 --> 00:37:24,366
I haven't seen you write anything.

663
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,850
And Nathan, I mean...

664
00:37:28,456 --> 00:37:32,225
the original Nathan,
he was forever writing things,

665
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,577
reading things to me,
showing me things.

666
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
So do it for me again, Nathan,

667
00:37:44,998 --> 00:37:46,305
like you used to.

668
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:19,610
Can you even type?

669
00:38:20,452 --> 00:38:22,799
I think I'd like you to leave
my house now, Mrs. Dubois.

670
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,317
Actually, this is my house...

671
00:38:27,508 --> 00:38:29,458
and I'd like Allison to stay.

672
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,444
She's invited some of her colleagues
over. They should be here in a minute.

673
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:43,145
Mrs. Dubois seems to think that
if the police take a look around the...

674
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,747
the property, they may turn up
that manuscript

675
00:38:45,872 --> 00:38:48,336
that she says you took
from Nathan's car.

676
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:54,200
We turned the place upside down.

677
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,350
So far, we found nothing.

678
00:38:57,349 --> 00:39:00,545
I'll give it more minutes, but I think
it's just about time to pack it in.

679
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,173
So that's it?
He gets away with everything?

680
00:39:04,883 --> 00:39:06,550
Everything except Gabrielle.

681
00:39:07,029 --> 00:39:09,888
She asked if we'd escort her husband
from the premises after we're done.

682
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,536
We might not be able to prove
Joe Tiernan's a murderer,

683
00:39:14,813 --> 00:39:17,132
but at least we got him
out of her life.

684
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:32,888
Are the girls down?

685
00:40:33,143 --> 00:40:34,550
Two out of three.

686
00:40:35,029 --> 00:40:37,475
Bridgette's still buzzing
about all the nice things

687
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,422
that Mr. Enright had to say
about her after class today,

688
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,067
how she should feel free
to draw what she wants

689
00:40:43,192 --> 00:40:44,442
when she wants.

690
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,775
Call me crazy. I think somebody
got some good news

691
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,175
from their dermatologist.

692
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,450
What is this?

693
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,175
It's a little picture of us that
Bridgette drew before she went to bed.

694
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,600
I looked very closely.
There's no lumps,

695
00:40:55,725 --> 00:40:58,575
growths or vestigial limbs
on either of us,

696
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,100
so I assume we're
in the pink of health.

697
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,650
She even gave us clothes.

698
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,175
Did I tell you that I took
a life-drawing class in college?

699
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,775
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

700
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,975
You ever done any modeling?

701
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,890
Get used to these boxers, babe,
because they're never coming off.

702
00:41:17,387 --> 00:41:19,437
You have something against art?

703
00:41:20,052 --> 00:41:22,659
I'm telling you.
You've got a little something.

704
00:41:22,784 --> 00:41:25,284
I just need to get my crayons.
