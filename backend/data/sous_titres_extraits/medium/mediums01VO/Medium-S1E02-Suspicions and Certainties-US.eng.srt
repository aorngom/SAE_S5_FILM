1
00:00:24,341 --> 00:00:25,535
Ivan Kinetko.

2
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,221
Ivan Kinetko, this is the Greater Phoenix Police!

3
00:00:29,314 --> 00:00:30,967
We have a warrant for your arrest.

4
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:33,108
The building is completely surrounded.

5
00:00:33,384 --> 00:00:34,971
Present yourself at the front door

6
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,924
with your hands above your head in 15 seconds or we're coming in.

7
00:00:39,037 --> 00:00:41,394
It's okay, baby. Just stay covered up. Don't panic.

8
00:00:41,596 --> 00:00:44,151
Mr. Kinetko, you have ten seconds!

9
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,881
Ten seconds to what?

10
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:47,956
Can't we talk?

11
00:00:48,042 --> 00:00:50,868
Can't a man bring his girlfriend to a hotel for...

12
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:56,803
Stay covered, baby, stay covered. Don't worry-- this is not about you. This is about me.

13
00:00:56,854 --> 00:00:58,078
Don't move! Don't move!

14
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,782
You just stay covered there. Don't you compromise your modesty.

15
00:01:00,823 --> 00:01:02,365
You haven't done anything wrong. 

16
00:01:02,668 --> 00:01:05,769
Have you no decency? Have you no shame?

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,563
Turn your backs and let the woman get dressed.

18
00:01:09,171 --> 00:01:13,971
Don't worry, darling. I am going to call my lawyer as soon as I get to the station.

19
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,240
He will have this whole thing unwound faster than you can say "ACLU."

20
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:23,667
Miss?

21
00:01:25,077 --> 00:01:26,792
I understand your discomfort,

22
00:01:26,904 --> 00:01:30,028
but I'm going to need you to tell me who you are and show me some identification.

23
00:01:33,488 --> 00:01:34,383
Miss?

24
00:01:41,589 --> 00:01:43,057
Oh, man...

25
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:46,017
What you got there, Ronny? Is she underage?

26
00:01:46,821 --> 00:01:47,563
No.

27
00:01:48,168 --> 00:01:50,000
Kinda the opposite problem.

28
00:01:50,994 --> 00:01:53,512
Looks like she's been dead about two weeks.

29
00:01:58,998 --> 00:02:01,295
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

30
00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:06,026
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scream. Mommy just had a bad dream.

31
00:02:06,098 --> 00:02:09,872
Mommy... you gotta stop doing that! Please, stop doing that.

32
00:02:09,954 --> 00:02:10,967
Yeah, Mommy.

33
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,015
Could you maybe stop doing that?

34
00:03:00,744 --> 00:03:05,731
Mom! It's 37 after 7:00 and I haven't eaten and I don't have any lunch money and today's the class trip

35
00:03:05,783 --> 00:03:09,018
so I have to have my blue jumper and you didn't sign my permission slip

36
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:12,463
and Bridgette... she's picking her nose and throwing snot balls at me.

37
00:03:12,555 --> 00:03:13,666
You lie!

38
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:15,361
I'm going to kill you!

39
00:03:15,455 --> 00:03:17,411
You kill me and I'll tell Mom!

40
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,603
Get out of bed and deal with your children.

41
00:03:22,053 --> 00:03:23,723
Can't you hear them? They need you.

42
00:03:25,187 --> 00:03:28,089
Oh, I'll be damned if I know what my son sees in you.

43
00:03:28,305 --> 00:03:31,203
It's okay. You already are damned.

44
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,248
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.

45
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:37,410
A beautiful day for a neighbor.

46
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:39,374
Would you be mine?

47
00:03:40,056 --> 00:03:42,477
Hey, Hot Lips, this is your wake-up call.

48
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:43,834
Go away.

49
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,248
It's not a beautiful day. Do you not hear the death threats wafting in from the hall?

50
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,889
Hey, kids, stop threatening to kill each other.

51
00:03:51,048 --> 00:03:52,621
Mommy finds it depressing.

52
00:03:52,702 --> 00:03:54,879
I don't want to get up. You're right. I'm depressed.

53
00:03:55,867 --> 00:03:57,142
You know what depression is?

54
00:03:57,714 --> 00:03:59,061
It's un-channelled anger.

55
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:01,243
Thank you. Thank you.

56
00:04:01,343 --> 00:04:02,866
Everything's different now.

57
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:04,955
But I'm still not getting up.

58
00:04:05,057 --> 00:04:06,095
Come on, Allison...

59
00:04:06,782 --> 00:04:09,833
Did you not hear her? Did you not hear Ariel?

60
00:04:10,054 --> 00:04:12,209
She's got a thrilling day lined up.

61
00:04:12,342 --> 00:04:16,951
Class trip, snot ball dodging, sister killing.

62
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,779
She's nine years old.

63
00:04:19,782 --> 00:04:22,085
I, on the other hand, am 33

64
00:04:22,153 --> 00:04:26,064
and when you go to work and the girls go to school I have nothing to look forward to.

65
00:04:26,157 --> 00:04:27,165
Al...

66
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:31,050
If I organize one more drawer, I'll go out of my mind.

67
00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:32,709
Objective observation?

68
00:04:32,878 --> 00:04:35,566
Ever since you made the decision not to go to law school,

69
00:04:35,747 --> 00:04:37,856
to go to work for the D.A. as a consultant...

70
00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:41,373
- I don't know, you seem kinda...
- Bitchy? Cranky? Pissed off?

71
00:04:41,517 --> 00:04:42,868
You can read minds.

72
00:04:44,516 --> 00:04:48,192
It's hard. They never call. He said he wanted to use me but...

73
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,056
Maybe he changed his mind.

74
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:53,220
I don't think he changed his mind. It's Phoenix.

75
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:57,368
How many cases do you think there are where he can actually use someone like you?

76
00:04:57,748 --> 00:04:58,745
He'll call.

77
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,618
When he's got something where he needs you, he'll call.

78
00:05:01,747 --> 00:05:03,733
Ooh... I know what I meant to ask you.

79
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:04,986
This'll cheer you up.

80
00:05:05,053 --> 00:05:06,662
What's the chance of us getting a sitter tonight?

81
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:08,259
The Siscos want to have dinner.

82
00:05:10,004 --> 00:05:12,073
Come on. The Siscos. You like them.

83
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,793
You'll never guess where.

84
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:16,476
Remember who you're talking to, okay?

85
00:05:16,804 --> 00:05:18,689
Not the place we went last weekend.

86
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:21,387
- What's the problem? It's a nice place.
- We were just there!

87
00:05:21,484 --> 00:05:24,708
I know, but it's the place the Siscos told us about. The place we promised we'd try with them.

88
00:05:24,827 --> 00:05:26,624
I didn't have the heart to tell Nick we'd already been.

89
00:05:26,738 --> 00:05:29,559
Besides, they're talking about maybe inviting the Hammersmiths and the Perrys.

90
00:05:30,772 --> 00:05:33,691
Nick mentioned it at lunch yesterday and it totally slipped my mind.

91
00:05:33,777 --> 00:05:35,625
So is we in or is we out?

92
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:41,468
Let's see-- dinner with four rocket scientists and their lovely wives? Oh, joy.

93
00:05:41,662 --> 00:05:44,882
I can barely keep my legs together at the mere thought of it.

94
00:05:44,985 --> 00:05:48,681
That's okay. I'm not much interested in you with your legs together anyway.

95
00:05:49,243 --> 00:05:50,089
Girls...

96
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:52,767
Mommy needs help getting out of bed!

97
00:05:55,803 --> 00:05:58,600
Will the jury foreman please rise and face the court?

98
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,389
- Here we go.
- Will the defendant please rise?

99
00:06:03,371 --> 00:06:06,176
And on the count of first-degree murder, how does the jury find?

100
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,405
Your Honor, it is with some regret that I report that we were unable to find unanimity

101
00:06:11,477 --> 00:06:13,220
and are hopelessly deadlocked.

102
00:06:17,737 --> 00:06:20,333
The jury is dismissed with the thanks of the court.

103
00:06:21,578 --> 00:06:25,110
Mistrial. Judge declared a mistrial.

104
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,518
Yes, I know. I was there.

105
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:29,959
Jury just couldn't convict. Understandable.

106
00:06:30,497 --> 00:06:32,683
Captured the bastard covered in his victim's blood,

107
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,566
still holding the chain saw that he used to cut up the body into nine pieces

108
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:39,389
so he could fit it into the tall kitchen garbage bags he had on hand,

109
00:06:39,435 --> 00:06:42,729
as opposed to simply cutting it in half and using the extra-strength backyard

110
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,927
and garden bags he had on his "to do" list to pick up.

111
00:06:46,021 --> 00:06:48,007
No, I know. I heard the testimony.

112
00:06:48,093 --> 00:06:51,754
Still, the jury could not convict. Deadlocked.

113
00:06:51,816 --> 00:06:53,464
- I know.
- You know.

114
00:06:54,184 --> 00:06:59,511
Oh, well, that's good that you know. You should know something. You're a jury consultant.

115
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:04,667
I mean, we spent thousands of dollars of taxpayers' money to hire you;

116
00:07:04,739 --> 00:07:09,552
countless man-hours profiling and interviewing and testing 100 and some-odd citizens,

117
00:07:09,617 --> 00:07:11,503
so we could pick the perfect jury...

118
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:15,804
hoping against hope that we could send this piece of human smegma to get a lethal injection.

119
00:07:15,871 --> 00:07:18,797
So it's really good that you know something, because it's clear the one thing

120
00:07:18,835 --> 00:07:22,956
you do not know is how to pick a jury that will vote for the death penalty.

121
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:26,746
District Attorney Devalos, I don't think I like your tone.

122
00:07:27,453 --> 00:07:28,988
Oh, well, then, I guess we're even.

123
00:07:29,177 --> 00:07:30,846
I don't think I like your work.

124
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,287
Ridiculous.

125
00:07:34,482 --> 00:07:35,496
Stupid.

126
00:07:37,473 --> 00:07:39,790
That's my wife, sir! All right.

127
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:42,586
- Absurd.
- Nine points, Paul...

128
00:07:42,674 --> 00:07:46,165
Absurd... absurd, absurd, absurd.

129
00:07:47,896 --> 00:07:50,221
A-B-S-U-R-D.

130
00:07:51,327 --> 00:07:52,131
Absurd.

131
00:07:52,192 --> 00:07:53,309
- Proper.
- Proper...

132
00:07:53,564 --> 00:07:55,751
Proper English. No. Eight points,

133
00:07:55,818 --> 00:08:00,881
- Betty, would give you 26...
- Absurd. The answer is "absurd."

134
00:08:01,557 --> 00:08:02,326
Silly.

135
00:08:04,424 --> 00:08:06,303
Foolish. Foolish. No.

136
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:09,115
Seven points, Paul. Give you the game.

137
00:08:09,386 --> 00:08:10,318
Freezing.

138
00:08:17,394 --> 00:08:18,141
Hello?

139
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:22,170
Good morning. Is Allison Dubois available for District Attorney Devalos?

140
00:08:22,257 --> 00:08:24,771
Oh, my God. You have no idea.

141
00:08:36,978 --> 00:08:38,590
Called at the last minute.

142
00:08:39,026 --> 00:08:40,414
Too late for day care.

143
00:08:40,572 --> 00:08:41,749
I'm sorry.

144
00:08:53,403 --> 00:08:54,401
Welcome back.

145
00:08:54,888 --> 00:08:57,263
Is this the new intern? The one taking your place?

146
00:08:58,248 --> 00:09:00,239
It's all right. Go on inside. He's waing for you.

147
00:09:00,326 --> 00:09:02,449
I'm sorry. He just called so last minute.

148
00:09:02,526 --> 00:09:04,523
It's all right. Leave her here. I'll keep an eye on her.

149
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:05,313
You sure?

150
00:09:11,681 --> 00:09:14,247
That's a mighty heart-healthy lunch you're having there.

151
00:09:14,606 --> 00:09:16,125
You trying to tell me something?

152
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:21,337
Have you had some kind of vision about my health, some premonition about my well-being?

153
00:09:21,414 --> 00:09:26,095
No, just something I say whenever I see a middle-aged man eating starch fried in lard.

154
00:09:27,124 --> 00:09:28,987
Haven't heard from you in a while.

155
00:09:29,472 --> 00:09:32,679
Figured maybe you thought about it and realized there was really no place for me

156
00:09:32,735 --> 00:09:34,835
in a district attorney's office. I mean...

157
00:09:36,105 --> 00:09:37,399
given what I do.

158
00:09:40,824 --> 00:09:44,507
Do me a favor. Take me through this one more time. This...

159
00:09:45,054 --> 00:09:46,938
thing you experience.

160
00:09:47,516 --> 00:09:53,062
Well, if you force me to break it down, categorize it... I guess...

161
00:09:53,998 --> 00:09:58,162
the main thing is... I mean, it's been happening since I was a kid.

162
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,487
I see people that have passed.

163
00:10:00,568 --> 00:10:03,214
Their spirits, they come to me, tell me things.

164
00:10:03,282 --> 00:10:04,622
People that have passed?

165
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:07,172
Dead people.

166
00:10:07,654 --> 00:10:10,654
What, they just come over to your house without being invited?

167
00:10:11,197 --> 00:10:14,034
- They're never invited.
- No. Of course not.

168
00:10:15,836 --> 00:10:20,029
To be honest, I'm not quite sure what to do with that.

169
00:10:20,173 --> 00:10:23,301
I mean, not that I doubt you, but from a prosecutorial point of view...

170
00:10:23,383 --> 00:10:24,293
No. I know.

171
00:10:25,205 --> 00:10:26,593
I also have dreams.

172
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:29,670
- Dreams.
- Dreams that come true.

173
00:10:30,557 --> 00:10:33,905
- Dreams. But again, in a court of law...
- No. I know. Believe me...

174
00:10:33,965 --> 00:10:36,204
I hear this stuff coming out of my mouth and...

175
00:10:36,357 --> 00:10:38,436
What about reading minds?

176
00:10:39,593 --> 00:10:42,132
Can you guess what a person's thinking?

177
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:46,715
Maybe even what their attitude about something might be?

178
00:10:47,304 --> 00:10:48,660
I don't know. Sometimes.

179
00:10:55,213 --> 00:10:58,404
He suffocates them, then hangs onto the corpses for days,

180
00:10:58,471 --> 00:11:02,004
sometimes weeks, and has sex with them, over and over again.

181
00:11:02,084 --> 00:11:04,185
Six of them that we know about.

182
00:11:04,267 --> 00:11:07,851
His sentencing trial is in three weeks. Jury selection begins on Monday.

183
00:11:09,411 --> 00:11:13,073
Can you help me find a jury to give him the maximum sentence?

184
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:15,996
12 men and women who would actually vote "yes"?

185
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,923
I think so. I mean, I'd certainly like to try.

186
00:11:20,037 --> 00:11:23,243
You understand what I'm asking? We have the death penalty here in Arizona.

187
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:27,332
I'm asking you to help me send this man to his death. Are you okay with that?

188
00:11:29,051 --> 00:11:32,806
If he's done the things you say he's done, why would I have a problem with that?

189
00:11:32,894 --> 00:11:34,905
I don't know. Some people might.

190
00:11:35,135 --> 00:11:36,375
Well, not me. No.

191
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:43,942
Obviously, no one can know what you're doing, helping us in this way.

192
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:47,030
So I can count on you to keep it a secret?

193
00:11:47,117 --> 00:11:49,693
I mean, your husband, I suppose, but beyond that...

194
00:11:50,106 --> 00:11:52,922
Oh, so now, it's lying and sending people to their death.

195
00:11:53,475 --> 00:11:56,640
By the way, the man you're going to help eliminate-- his name is...

196
00:11:56,727 --> 00:11:59,204
Ivan Kinetko. Yeah. I know.

197
00:12:04,622 --> 00:12:07,470
He called! He called! He called! He called!

198
00:12:07,545 --> 00:12:08,692
I'm sorry, who called?

199
00:12:09,004 --> 00:12:10,951
The District Attorney's Office. They need me.

200
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,325
- Say hi to the kids.
- Hi to the kids.

201
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:16,701
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Daddy.

202
00:12:16,814 --> 00:12:19,173
- Hi, Daddy.
- Someone's in a good mood.

203
00:12:19,482 --> 00:12:21,590
Oh, you can read minds, too.

204
00:12:23,217 --> 00:12:26,084
So Nick is married to Diane who's a financial something.

205
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:30,396
And Alan is married to Kamala, who's a doctor-- a therapist of some kind-- works with kids.

206
00:12:30,522 --> 00:12:33,586
And Brett is married to Jennifer who works for some charity.

207
00:12:33,674 --> 00:12:37,857
Nick and Diane, Alan and Kamala, Brett and Jessica.

208
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:38,815
Jennifer.

209
00:12:40,105 --> 00:12:42,552
Brett and Jennifer. Sorry.

210
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,059
A psychic with a bad memory. Go figure.

211
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:48,229
They just don't make 'em like they used to.

212
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:51,117
Uh, so tonight...

213
00:12:51,702 --> 00:12:54,912
These people, they're all scientists. I mean, at least the guys are, so...

214
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,492
You know, if somebody says-- and you know they're going to--

215
00:12:57,963 --> 00:12:58,920
What do you do?

216
00:13:03,007 --> 00:13:04,676
- Oh, what?
- Continue.

217
00:13:04,854 --> 00:13:06,658
Well, obviously, you know the rest.

218
00:13:07,927 --> 00:13:11,972
A psychic with a bad memory can't remember. Why don't you finish your thought.

219
00:13:12,131 --> 00:13:15,987
Okay, I'm just saying, I mean, if somebody says, "So, Allison, what do you do for a living?"

220
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,576
- I'm curious.
- Well, you know what I do for a living.

221
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:20,865
Well, I mean, I curious how you're going to put it.

222
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:24,092
Well, gosh, dear, how would you like me to put it?

223
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:27,679
- I'm just saying, I mean, there are lots of ways of saying...
- You're worried I'm going to embarrass you?

224
00:13:27,831 --> 00:13:29,410
No. God, no.

225
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:32,543
Well, then don't worry so much about how things are put.

226
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,695
Because everything will be put the way it needs to be put.

227
00:13:34,756 --> 00:13:38,560
And if you don't like the way things are put, you can just go "ptth!" yourself.

228
00:13:42,161 --> 00:13:43,598
- Alan.
- Sorry we're late.

229
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,666
- Jessica.
- Jennifer.

230
00:13:47,495 --> 00:13:48,938
Hey. How are you?

231
00:13:49,764 --> 00:13:53,809
I mean this 11-year-old boy hasn't spoken since he's six. Five years.

232
00:13:53,895 --> 00:13:56,787
And there's nothing physiologically wrong with him. It's a control thing.

233
00:13:56,868 --> 00:14:00,428
And obviously his parents are going completely out of their minds. Sent him everywhere.

234
00:14:00,863 --> 00:14:01,600
Tell them.

235
00:14:02,143 --> 00:14:07,202
- Well, I developed this therapy.
- Very Annie Sullivan. Very Miracle Worker.

236
00:14:07,577 --> 00:14:10,069
- Tell them.
- It's very intense.

237
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,907
Just he and I in a cabin.

238
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,367
For four days.

239
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:16,848
No food, unless he asks for it. No water.

240
00:14:17,011 --> 00:14:18,726
And I have everything under lock and key.

241
00:14:18,804 --> 00:14:21,799
Wait a second. Unless he asks for it? You're willing to starve this kid?

242
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,912
No, no, no. No one's starved. She's not going to starve anybody.

243
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:28,061
Listen to this. The people from the Dr. Phil show called her.

244
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:29,643
Tell them.

245
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,167
Um...

246
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:35,808
the first day... was like a standoff.

247
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:37,139
You know what he's doing--

248
00:14:37,225 --> 00:14:40,359
he's waiting for her to go to asleep, so he can get the key.

249
00:14:40,436 --> 00:14:41,430
Get to the food.

250
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,893
Honey, I think you're making a big deal out of this.

251
00:14:43,989 --> 00:14:46,655
- No, I'm proud.
- So wait a second. What happened?

252
00:14:47,108 --> 00:14:49,228
- Did anyone fall asleep?
- Of course not.

253
00:14:49,397 --> 00:14:52,376
I mean, she's not falling asleep. She's staying up.

254
00:14:52,495 --> 00:14:56,483
And she's talking to him. Explaining the jig is up. You've met your match. Right?

255
00:14:56,682 --> 00:14:59,882
I know you can talk, your parents know you can talk and your teachers know you can talk,

256
00:14:59,948 --> 00:15:02,682
and no one is leaving here, no one is sleeping and for damn sure

257
00:15:02,718 --> 00:15:05,110
no one's getting anything to eat until you say something.

258
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:08,442
- And how long did it take?
- I didn't hear from her for 37 hours.

259
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:10,532
 You stayed up with him for 37 hours straight?

260
00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:13,618
Um, I'm not sure. I don't know.

261
00:15:14,142 --> 00:15:18,083
I think there were brief periods of unconsciousness for both of us.

262
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,001
- And it worked? He spoke?
- Hell, yes, he spoke.

263
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,957
And he hasn't stopped speaking since.

264
00:15:23,276 --> 00:15:24,176
Wow.

265
00:15:26,231 --> 00:15:27,340
 What did he say?

266
00:15:28,575 --> 00:15:30,868
Actually, his first words were, uh...

267
00:15:31,268 --> 00:15:32,051
"Jesus."

268
00:15:35,145 --> 00:15:37,438
She's flying east to Yale next week.

269
00:15:37,555 --> 00:15:39,869
Being honored by the Childhood Behavioral Council.

270
00:15:40,171 --> 00:15:43,120
Wow. That must be very gratifying.

271
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,763
Congratulations.

272
00:15:49,788 --> 00:15:50,621
Thank you.

273
00:15:52,062 --> 00:15:54,488
I'm still a little uncomfortable with all the fuss.

274
00:15:56,525 --> 00:15:57,555
What do you do?

275
00:15:58,015 --> 00:15:58,722
Me?

276
00:16:00,211 --> 00:16:04,112
I work part-time at the District Attorney's Office. It's very boring.

277
00:16:08,855 --> 00:16:11,296
You had fun, I know you did.

278
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:13,088
Hey, I love a good story.

279
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:14,875
What are you talking about?

280
00:16:15,505 --> 00:16:19,361
Annie Sullivan and the Jesus Boy. You seemed to like it.

281
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,055
What, are you saying she's lying?

282
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,304
No. She didn't tell the story; her husband did.

283
00:16:25,745 --> 00:16:29,862
Look, I'm just saying that I don't think everything necessarily happened the way we were told.

284
00:16:30,564 --> 00:16:32,893
You suspect this or you know this?

285
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:36,549
Are you asking if I was there? I wasn't there.

286
00:16:37,066 --> 00:16:40,204
So you'll concede the possibility that the story is true?

287
00:16:41,946 --> 00:16:43,482
Did I miss something here?

288
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,937
When did we make the leap from having impressions about things

289
00:16:47,095 --> 00:16:49,081
to being certain about things?

290
00:16:49,748 --> 00:16:51,190
I'm just telling you what I think.

291
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:53,214
Well, it sounds like you're telling me what you know.

292
00:16:53,368 --> 00:16:55,432
And frankly, it's scaring the crap out of me.

293
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,114
Is that what you're doing for the D.A. next week? Is that what you're selling, certainty?

294
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,963
If it is, doesn't that bother you a little?

295
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:03,757
No. Why? Should it?

296
00:17:04,201 --> 00:17:06,679
Okay, maybe I got this wrong,

297
00:17:06,742 --> 00:17:10,275
but somewhere between pulling my pants off and passing me the soap in the shower,

298
00:17:10,311 --> 00:17:13,296
did you or did you not say that you were going to be helping the D.A.

299
00:17:13,342 --> 00:17:15,840
select a jury that he hoped would send a man to the electric chair.

300
00:17:15,891 --> 00:17:18,729
No. Lethal injection. We are very enlightened here in Arizona.

301
00:17:18,795 --> 00:17:22,739
We do lethal injection. Oh, yeah. Oh, and by the way, that man--

302
00:17:22,972 --> 00:17:26,510
he killed six women. Then he raped them...

303
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:28,896
and then he raped them, and then he raped them.

304
00:17:29,393 --> 00:17:32,045
- Says the D.A.
- Says the evidence.

305
00:17:32,168 --> 00:17:33,908
You're certain of this.

306
00:17:35,767 --> 00:17:39,955
I mean, a guy might die, Allison. Doesn't that give you... I don't know... pause?

307
00:17:40,764 --> 00:17:43,534
All right, forget that. What if he's guilty and you pick the wrong people?

308
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,177
- What if you're responsible for him walking?
- I'm confused.

309
00:17:46,254 --> 00:17:49,090
Are you worried that I'll be good at what I do or not good enough?

310
00:17:49,147 --> 00:17:52,356
I don't know. I guess I'm worried you may do something crazy and human like...

311
00:17:52,434 --> 00:17:54,982
- what do you know... make a mistake.
- That isn't going to happen.

312
00:17:55,064 --> 00:17:57,624
- Because?
- I know what I know.

313
00:17:57,706 --> 00:17:59,019
But you don't.

314
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:03,324
You didn't know the district attorney was going to call this morning.

315
00:18:03,385 --> 00:18:06,840
You didn't know that Ariel's school trip was going to be canceled at the last minute.

316
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:10,102
Hell, you don't even know that Brett is married to Jennifer and not Jessica.

317
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:12,437
But suddenly you know who's lying and who's not lying,

318
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,135
and who's going to vote "yes" and who's going to vote "no,"

319
00:18:15,222 --> 00:18:18,602
and whether some little boy you never met said "Jesus" or not.

320
00:18:21,412 --> 00:18:23,245
Will you listen to yourself, Allison?

321
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,569
That's what I'm trying to do.

322
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,176
Very nice.

323
00:18:42,629 --> 00:18:43,904
Very impressive.

324
00:18:45,897 --> 00:18:48,456
I admire the discipline it takes to...

325
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:52,015
achieve this kind of physical...

326
00:18:52,885 --> 00:18:53,950
perfection.

327
00:18:57,298 --> 00:18:58,324
You're warm.

328
00:18:59,629 --> 00:19:00,805
Let me cool you off.

329
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:03,341
Don't worry, darling.

330
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,106
Relief is but a moment away.

331
00:19:43,507 --> 00:19:44,991
Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

332
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:47,080
You can just put those on the tables right there.

333
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,552
I apologize. Thanks, guys.

334
00:19:52,293 --> 00:19:55,216
- So what's your thesis called?
- Excuse me?

335
00:19:56,311 --> 00:19:58,631
Everyone here thinks that you're the intern who came back

336
00:19:58,687 --> 00:20:01,822
to write her thesis on jury selection in capital trials, so...

337
00:20:01,905 --> 00:20:04,442
Well, then it'd be, uh, "Jury Selection in Capital Trials."

338
00:20:04,531 --> 00:20:05,386
Catchy.

339
00:20:05,984 --> 00:20:08,407
140... please sit down.

340
00:20:09,138 --> 00:20:12,590
144 prospective jurors. These are their questionnaires.

341
00:20:13,526 --> 00:20:14,908
I don't get to meet them?

342
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,619
Why don't we just wait and see how you do with the questionnaires first.

343
00:20:19,578 --> 00:20:22,915
You can usually identify the obvious deadheads off of these.

344
00:20:22,992 --> 00:20:25,618
- "Deadheads"?
- People we absolutely won't accept.

345
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,578
In this case, people that are never going to vote for capital punishment.

346
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,749
If it has a red Post-it on it,

347
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,256
it means the jury consultant thinks the person is a definite "no."

348
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:43,478
If it has a green Post-it on it, it means she thinks the person is a definite "yes."

349
00:20:43,566 --> 00:20:45,542
And if it has no Post-it on it at all,

350
00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:49,305
it means she has no opinion yet and it's something we'll figure out when we get to court.

351
00:20:49,386 --> 00:20:52,823
- What happens in court?
- We get six strikes and so does the other side.

352
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,226
- Strikes?
- A free pass.

353
00:20:54,314 --> 00:20:57,451
These are people that you can say "no" to without having to explain yourself.

354
00:20:57,528 --> 00:20:59,836
- The deadheads.
- Well, no.

355
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,536
That's where it gets tricky.

356
00:21:04,075 --> 00:21:07,511
The judge will probably throw out most of the deadheads without prompting.

357
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:11,161
What you want to save your strikes for are the people that you think

358
00:21:11,215 --> 00:21:14,403
the other side is desperate to have that the judge might not kick out.

359
00:21:14,618 --> 00:21:18,294
At the same time, the other side is going to use their six strikes

360
00:21:18,372 --> 00:21:21,573
to eliminate the people they think you really want to have, okay?

361
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,568
So, I brought these.

362
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:26,978
They're half the size of the others, so we can tell yours from hers.

363
00:21:27,436 --> 00:21:29,963
- So what do you think?
- About what?

364
00:21:33,367 --> 00:21:35,124
It's just a bunch of paper.

365
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,792
So you can't just look at them, touch them, just feel something?

366
00:21:40,868 --> 00:21:42,210
I don't know. I haven't tried.

367
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:44,924
So getting aimpression off an inanimate objects is not something...

368
00:21:44,995 --> 00:21:45,953
I don't know.

369
00:21:46,261 --> 00:21:50,039
You have to understand these aren't feelings I've ever gone out of my way to have.

370
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:54,484
Used to be I'd walk into a place or I'd meet a person and I'd get that feeling,

371
00:21:54,705 --> 00:21:56,132
and I'd just want a drink.

372
00:21:57,996 --> 00:21:59,255
This is new.

373
00:22:01,058 --> 00:22:03,220
I guess I was counting on meeting the people.

374
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:06,162
Well, I don't know what to tell you. This is how we start.

375
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,083
In any event, your involvement in this process has got to be...

376
00:22:11,175 --> 00:22:12,455
Secret. I heard.

377
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:16,361
Allison, if this isn't something you're interested in doing...

378
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:20,601
No, no. I'm interested. It's just that, if I tell you something, I want to be certain.

379
00:22:20,692 --> 00:22:21,984
Don't worry about that.

380
00:22:22,281 --> 00:22:24,955
I'm up to my eyeballs in people who are certain.

381
00:22:25,395 --> 00:22:28,413
It would just be nice to meet someone who's right for a change.

382
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,391
I'll be in my office when you're done.

383
00:22:42,739 --> 00:22:47,318
Jonathan McCall. Born January 20, 1968.

384
00:22:47,523 --> 00:22:53,692
1989-1992, Divinity Studies at the School of Theology at Catholic University.

385
00:23:02,361 --> 00:23:06,636
Naomi Perreault. Born April 17, 1959.

386
00:23:06,713 --> 00:23:10,675
Question: Have you ever lost a friend or loved one to a violent crime?

387
00:23:10,783 --> 00:23:12,349
Answer: Yes.

388
00:23:12,584 --> 00:23:16,435
A coworker of mine was killed for his car one night after coming out of a Laundromat.

389
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:19,318
It was especially sad because he had won the car just a month earlier

390
00:23:19,426 --> 00:23:21,888
in a sales promotion they ran here at the company.

391
00:23:31,888 --> 00:23:36,618
Maxine Harris. Born November 3, 1970.

392
00:23:37,146 --> 00:23:39,663
Baptist. Single.

393
00:23:40,341 --> 00:23:44,883
I've supervised data entry for the Bocktel Company since 1998.

394
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:46,915
I own my own home.

395
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:52,538
I read one newspaper and I try to watch one newscast every day if I have the time.

396
00:23:52,977 --> 00:23:55,782
I spend a lot of time here with my mother.

397
00:23:56,613 --> 00:24:01,825
She's been in the hospital since 2002 when she suffered a massive stroke.

398
00:24:03,858 --> 00:24:06,402
I believe in the sanctity of life.

399
00:24:07,773 --> 00:24:10,467
I believe that things happen for a reason.

400
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:11,805
Hello.

401
00:25:12,373 --> 00:25:14,857
Hey... So how's the job?

402
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,845
It's great. Instead of sitting home all day and talking to no one,

403
00:25:18,906 --> 00:25:22,219
I'm in a big anonymous room talking to no one. It's all I could've hoped for.

404
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:25,654
Hmm. Do you know it's 20 minutes after 9:00?

405
00:25:25,782 --> 00:25:29,909
Oh, God, Joe, I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

406
00:25:30,606 --> 00:25:32,270
It's okay, don't worry about it.

407
00:25:32,956 --> 00:25:34,799
Psychic with a bad sense of time.

408
00:25:36,474 --> 00:25:37,938
Do you remember where you live?

409
00:25:38,143 --> 00:25:41,879
Hmm, I'm seeing a house.

410
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:46,100
I'm seeing a guy in his underwear. I'm seeing lots of dishes in the sink.

411
00:25:46,694 --> 00:25:48,577
It's amazing how you do that.

412
00:25:49,008 --> 00:25:50,036
I'll wait up.

413
00:25:50,574 --> 00:25:51,691
Okay, bye, babe.

414
00:26:00,902 --> 00:26:02,940
You understand I'm not paying you by the hour, right?

415
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:07,685
I stuck my head in there two or three times but you seemed to be in your own world.

416
00:26:07,762 --> 00:26:11,008
That's okay. You want the good news or the bad news?

417
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,349
Give me it all. I'm a big boy. I can take it.

418
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:14,863
Okay, well...

419
00:26:15,545 --> 00:26:18,238
I got through almost all of them. And I got things off a lot of them.

420
00:26:18,304 --> 00:26:21,126
But I don't agree with most of what your jury consultant told you.

421
00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:22,314
What do you mean?

422
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:26,076
Well, like this woman for instance. Maxine Harris.

423
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:29,400
Yes, she's religious, but that's not all she is.

424
00:26:29,912 --> 00:26:33,195
She has a mother who's been confined to the hospital for the last two years

425
00:26:33,286 --> 00:26:38,340
despite the fact that she can't see, can't hear, can't eat and can't even breathe on her own.

426
00:26:38,421 --> 00:26:39,783
You know what she prays for?

427
00:26:39,938 --> 00:26:42,281
She prays for an earthquake to knock the building down.

428
00:26:42,349 --> 00:26:45,323
She prays for a fire to take out her mother's wing.

429
00:26:45,587 --> 00:26:49,076
All she wants to do is put this old woman out of her misery,

430
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:50,495
and the state won't let her.

431
00:26:51,953 --> 00:26:54,238
Maxine Harris can be reached.

432
00:26:54,528 --> 00:26:56,244
She will understand your frustration.

433
00:26:56,353 --> 00:26:59,603
She'll understand the victim's family's need for closure.

434
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:05,262
And I believe the defense is going to read it the way your expert did and advocate for her.

435
00:27:05,379 --> 00:27:08,619
So by looking like you lose one, you win one.

436
00:27:09,243 --> 00:27:10,165
Should I go on?

437
00:27:10,887 --> 00:27:13,826
Okay, this guy here, he's a fireman, right?

438
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,616
So your expert has him as a definite "yes."

439
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:19,612
She's thinking law and order guy, of course he'll vote for the needle.

440
00:27:19,689 --> 00:27:23,391
But his best friend's brother is on death row in Nevada.

441
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,772
Wait a second, is that on the questionnaire?

442
00:27:27,718 --> 00:27:28,398
Sorry.

443
00:27:28,792 --> 00:27:32,527
Neither is the fact that this school teacher she has as a definite "no"

444
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:35,024
was raped 20 years ago when she was in college.

445
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,340
The guy who raped her hired a great attorney and got off, went on to rape three other women,

446
00:27:39,514 --> 00:27:44,342
finally got caught and put away, but is up for parole later this year and will probably get it.

447
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:47,117
I mean, if I'm you, I want that lady in my lifeboat.

448
00:27:50,248 --> 00:27:51,704
What are you doing tomrow?

449
00:27:52,185 --> 00:27:53,157
I don't know, why?

450
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:56,835
How'd you like to come to court with me, meet some of these people?

451
00:28:02,554 --> 00:28:04,617
Stop smiling like that.

452
00:28:05,181 --> 00:28:08,902
The moonlight's bouncing off your teeth and keeping me awake.

453
00:28:09,246 --> 00:28:10,137
Tough.

454
00:28:10,941 --> 00:28:13,137
I was pretty great today.

455
00:28:13,878 --> 00:28:17,944
It was pretty great being me today.

456
00:28:19,008 --> 00:28:24,048
Whatever happened to the old Allison? The depressed Allison? I miss her.

457
00:28:24,381 --> 00:28:27,755
I don't know. I will be in court tomorrow.

458
00:28:27,996 --> 00:28:29,962
So if I see her, I'll ask her.

459
00:28:30,802 --> 00:28:31,677
Court.

460
00:28:32,163 --> 00:28:32,973
Really?

461
00:28:34,355 --> 00:28:35,527
Parking ticket?

462
00:28:36,116 --> 00:28:39,183
You hate being wrong, don't you?

463
00:28:39,275 --> 00:28:40,278
Am I wrong?

464
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:43,084
Are you sure?

465
00:28:44,865 --> 00:28:46,157
Are you certain?

466
00:28:47,673 --> 00:28:49,689
Or is it just something you suspect?

467
00:28:53,335 --> 00:28:55,342
Say good night, Gracie.

468
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,641
Good night, Gracie.

469
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,190
What's your hurry?

470
00:29:10,998 --> 00:29:14,026
Oh, you don't want me to change my mind now, do you?

471
00:29:14,102 --> 00:29:15,557
You're not going to change your mind.

472
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:19,898
Well, aren't you afraid your girlfriend might change her mind?

473
00:29:20,288 --> 00:29:22,350
Or do you guys do this all the time?

474
00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:25,519
'Cause me, I've never done this.

475
00:29:26,085 --> 00:29:28,591
Thought about it, but never done it.

476
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:30,531
She's not going to change her mind.

477
00:29:31,351 --> 00:29:33,143
When she sees how beautiful you are...

478
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:34,976
When you see how beautiful she is...

479
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,963
When do I get a look at her?

480
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:40,915
I mean, time's a-wastin'. I'm sobering up here, Slick.

481
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:44,382
She's just inside. She's sitting on the couch.

482
00:29:44,515 --> 00:29:45,532
She's waiting for you.

483
00:29:55,349 --> 00:29:56,378
Oh, my God!

484
00:30:05,395 --> 00:30:10,908
Do you wish to enter a challenge to the seating of potential juror number 12, Maxine Harris?

485
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:13,714
We certainly do not, Your Honor.

486
00:30:13,796 --> 00:30:18,261
And according to my records, the prosecution has exhausted all of its challenges.

487
00:30:18,338 --> 00:30:20,405
Do you concur, District Attorney Devalos?

488
00:30:21,477 --> 00:30:22,992
I'm afraid so, Your Honor.

489
00:30:23,857 --> 00:30:25,090
Very well, then.

490
00:30:25,628 --> 00:30:28,654
Ms. Harris, if you please. We have a jury.

491
00:30:29,479 --> 00:30:31,403
Court will recess for ten minutes.

492
00:30:31,552 --> 00:30:34,513
At that time, the sheriff's deputies will escort in the defendant

493
00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:37,670
so the court can begin to hear pre-trial motions.

494
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,551
Gentlemen.

495
00:30:40,364 --> 00:30:44,087
Mr. District Attorney, sir, I cannot accept responsibility for an outcome

496
00:30:44,143 --> 00:30:48,091
when I am not given the opportunity to participate in the events leading up to that outcome.

497
00:30:48,188 --> 00:30:51,567
- Certainly you can understand that.
- Actually, I find it all rather confusing.

498
00:30:51,634 --> 00:30:55,785
To be honest, I don't recall you accepting any responsibility when you did participate.

499
00:31:03,967 --> 00:31:06,751
That's against the law, you know.

500
00:31:09,379 --> 00:31:11,097
I don't want to make any trouble.

501
00:31:11,192 --> 00:31:13,885
Is that what you're doing? That's not how I see it.

502
00:31:14,341 --> 00:31:20,019
Allison, you were right about every single person we cross-examined today.

503
00:31:20,168 --> 00:31:22,993
- Well, I... 
- I got to tell you, I'm starting to believe

504
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:26,886
if I don't screw this up, we have a real shot at getting rid of this monster.

505
00:31:31,708 --> 00:31:34,202
This is Italy...

506
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:40,616
where art and the art of hospitality, go hand in hand.

507
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:44,175
But no trip to Italy would be complete

508
00:31:44,263 --> 00:31:47,719
without a gondola ride through the Venice canals.

509
00:31:49,345 --> 00:31:51,958
It's really very nice here, Allison.

510
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,902
The women are beautiful, the climate.

511
00:31:55,722 --> 00:31:58,384
I'm sorry we didn't get a chance to meet in America,

512
00:31:58,485 --> 00:32:03,484
but the second I heard there was a hung jury and I saw the chance to escape...

513
00:32:03,935 --> 00:32:07,763
See, you were wrong about Maxine Harris.

514
00:32:09,466 --> 00:32:12,613
No way that woman was going to give me the needle.

515
00:32:13,817 --> 00:32:15,250
Better luck next time.

516
00:32:19,002 --> 00:32:21,251
No... Oh!

517
00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:27,948
It's still Thursday, right?

518
00:32:29,575 --> 00:32:31,378
The jury's still out, right?

519
00:32:31,604 --> 00:32:33,293
There's no verdict yet, right?

520
00:32:33,411 --> 00:32:36,636
Oh, God, Allison, it's the middle of the night.

521
00:32:36,985 --> 00:32:39,591
That's not necessary. It was just a question.

522
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:41,805
I love you, too.

523
00:32:44,408 --> 00:32:46,375
- Loss...
- Loss...

524
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:49,340
Gain, gain, gain, gain, gain, gain.

525
00:32:50,193 --> 00:32:51,066
Found.

526
00:32:51,694 --> 00:32:56,713
Oh, she said "loss," I think, without the "T." All right, eight points, Paul.

527
00:32:56,855 --> 00:32:59,395
- Opposite.
- Find?

528
00:33:02,572 --> 00:33:03,414
Hello.

529
00:33:03,543 --> 00:33:07,295
Allison? It was unanimous. Death by lethal injection.

530
00:33:07,581 --> 00:33:10,009
The death penalty? You're kidding me.

531
00:33:11,611 --> 00:33:13,116
He's not going to Italy.

532
00:33:13,407 --> 00:33:14,893
Italy? What are you talking about?

533
00:33:15,006 --> 00:33:16,905
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.

534
00:33:17,019 --> 00:33:20,597
That's wonderful. I mean, it's terrible, but it's wonderful.

535
00:33:20,738 --> 00:33:22,624
Allison, congratulations.

536
00:33:22,783 --> 00:33:25,322
I know we wouldn't be here if it weren't for you.

537
00:33:27,652 --> 00:33:31,318
Oh! I'm king of the world!

538
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:35,000
Anatomically speaking, I don't think that's possible.

539
00:33:35,385 --> 00:33:37,018
I'm still king of the world.

540
00:33:37,447 --> 00:33:40,356
Come on, Allison. The news is about to start.

541
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:44,661
Shh! You wake 'em up, you put 'em back to sleep.

542
00:33:44,881 --> 00:33:47,386
Come on, King. This is exciting.

543
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,562
That's right, Bill. History of a sort was made here today.

544
00:33:49,658 --> 00:33:54,283
Remarkably, this jury spent less than 2½ hours to return a sentence of death

545
00:33:54,329 --> 00:33:59,162
by lethal injection in the case of Ivan Kinetko, a serial murderer and rapist.

546
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:03,212
And while District Attorney Manuel Devalos seemed highly gratified by the swift

547
00:34:03,282 --> 00:34:08,071
and certain verdict the jury gave him, the accused and his defense team seemed stunned

548
00:34:08,158 --> 00:34:10,483
by both the speed and certainty of this verdict.

549
00:34:10,554 --> 00:34:11,952
Wait a second. That's not him.

550
00:34:12,687 --> 00:34:15,412
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, my God. Something's wrong.

551
00:34:15,576 --> 00:34:17,276
That's not the man in my dreams!

552
00:34:18,761 --> 00:34:21,116
- Okay. Does that really matter?
- It matters to me!

553
00:34:21,213 --> 00:34:23,242
That's not the man I saw commit the crimes.

554
00:34:23,789 --> 00:34:25,981
Hey? Where are you going?

555
00:34:28,173 --> 00:34:32,607
- But sir, I'm not even sure he's guilty.
- That's all right, Allison. I am.

556
00:34:32,672 --> 00:34:36,584
- But...
- There are no buts. There can't be.

557
00:34:38,171 --> 00:34:43,399
I got a lab full of DNA to prove that he's our man. Besides, he confessed.

558
00:34:43,502 --> 00:34:46,450
In any event, this was not the trial to determine guilt or innocence.

559
00:34:46,553 --> 00:34:49,799
We had that trial three months ago. This trial was about sentencing.

560
00:34:49,882 --> 00:34:54,872
So go to sleep, get some rest. You've done a great thing here.

561
00:34:55,042 --> 00:34:56,716
But now, I'm not so sure.

562
00:34:56,819 --> 00:34:59,865
Allison, so it doesn't look like the face in your dreams.

563
00:34:59,994 --> 00:35:03,035
So what? Who knows where you got that face from?

564
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,500
And what difference does it make? Maybe your dreams are wrong.

565
00:35:06,603 --> 00:35:10,602
Frankly, I don't care. I believe your instincts about people are right.

566
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:13,428
Today, that's what mattered.

567
00:35:13,618 --> 00:35:16,598
- But I can't be wrong.
- Sure you can.

568
00:35:16,694 --> 00:35:20,750
You're a human being. The ability to be wrong is one of the membership requirements.

569
00:35:20,903 --> 00:35:25,102
The willingness to admit it-- well, that gets you extra points.

570
00:35:44,282 --> 00:35:49,489
Extra! Get your morning paper! Read all about the murder! Extra!

571
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,893
Buy a paper and meet me down the block.

572
00:35:52,145 --> 00:35:57,200
When I realized you weren't going to wake yourself up from a sound sleep complaining of a nightmare,

573
00:35:57,518 --> 00:35:59,841
I got scared and woke myself up.

574
00:36:00,396 --> 00:36:02,995
Not funny. Turn that off, will ya?

575
00:36:05,781 --> 00:36:10,031
This is my fault, right? I asked for the old depressed Allison back and...

576
00:36:10,646 --> 00:36:12,022
Still not funny.

577
00:36:15,545 --> 00:36:19,876
Okay, Mr. Science Guy, how dead-on is all this DNA stuff?

578
00:36:20,477 --> 00:36:22,058
Dead dead-on.

579
00:36:22,775 --> 00:36:25,616
Better than a fingerprint. It's virtually perfect.

580
00:36:26,676 --> 00:36:28,872
So then I must really have been wrong.

581
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:32,872
Well, okay. But only about the part that matters least.

582
00:36:33,256 --> 00:36:34,342
How can you say that?

583
00:36:34,464 --> 00:36:37,378
I move my lips, I push out air.

584
00:36:37,553 --> 00:36:38,780
There's nothing to it.

585
00:36:39,235 --> 00:36:41,943
Allison, who cares what he looked like in your dreams?

586
00:36:42,687 --> 00:36:46,946
I care. I mean, if I'm wrong about that, I could be wrong about other things.

587
00:36:47,142 --> 00:36:49,859
- Hallelujah.
- It's not funny.

588
00:36:49,937 --> 00:36:52,281
I don't find it funny. I find it comforting.

589
00:36:52,368 --> 00:36:55,523
Well, I find it confusing and depressing.

590
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:59,511
I mean, I feel like that chemist who set out

591
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:03,014
to prevent heart attacks and accidentally discovered Viagra.

592
00:37:03,117 --> 00:37:06,613
That man is a fine chemist, by the way. A very fine chemist.

593
00:37:06,681 --> 00:37:08,487
He has nothing to be depressed about.

594
00:37:08,651 --> 00:37:11,466
- Shut up.
- What difference does it make?

595
00:37:11,836 --> 00:37:15,138
As long as we're certain the real killer is going to meet his maker.

596
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:17,657
As long as theittle boy finally talks.

597
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:21,953
As long as horny old men can bed sweet young girls half their age,

598
00:37:22,024 --> 00:37:24,872
I ask you, what's the difference?

599
00:37:25,674 --> 00:37:28,758
And by the way, how old are you?

600
00:37:29,382 --> 00:37:33,872
About half your age. Just don't turn on any more lights.

601
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,452
Guess who wants to have dinner tomorrow night?

602
00:37:44,619 --> 00:37:47,773
This is a whole new nightmare. I can see it coming.

603
00:37:47,856 --> 00:37:51,419
That's right. Your favorite friends at your favorite place.

604
00:37:51,859 --> 00:37:53,047
Come on. It'll be fun.

605
00:37:53,215 --> 00:37:56,023
We'll listen to their stories, you can tell me what really happened afterwards.

606
00:37:58,224 --> 00:37:59,073
Where you going?

607
00:38:00,134 --> 00:38:05,043
I'm going to check that your father isn't in our bed. I'm tired.

608
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,098
Oh, no, thank you. I'm the designated driver tonight.

609
00:38:19,834 --> 00:38:24,386
So, wait a second. The last time I saw you, you were headed east. How'd your conference go?

610
00:38:25,361 --> 00:38:27,771
You know what? I didn't go.

611
00:38:28,212 --> 00:38:29,815
I felt a little funny.

612
00:38:29,926 --> 00:38:33,424
I couldn't help but wonder how much of what happened was...

613
00:38:34,263 --> 00:38:37,290
- therapy or how much was luck.
- It wasn't luck.

614
00:38:37,383 --> 00:38:42,911
I'm not saying it was all luck, I am just saying that one time does not a proven protocol make.

615
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,780
I want to work on it some more.

616
00:38:44,928 --> 00:38:48,399
You know, I mean, there's no accounting for happy accidents.

617
00:38:48,502 --> 00:38:49,808
I know what you mean.

618
00:38:50,324 --> 00:38:51,846
Here's to happy accidents.

619
00:38:52,184 --> 00:38:53,023
Hear, hear.

620
00:38:55,046 --> 00:38:59,060
Now, I'm remembering that you do something for the government.

621
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:01,486
She works for the local District Attorney's Office.

622
00:39:01,932 --> 00:39:03,995
District Attorney Manuel Devalos.

623
00:39:04,286 --> 00:39:06,023
The Ivan Kinetko trial.

624
00:39:07,006 --> 00:39:11,343
- We're not supposed to discuss that.
- Well, I'm proud. I'm proud, baby.

625
00:39:11,409 --> 00:39:14,634
You were you involved in that trial? That necrophiliac rapist guy?

626
00:39:14,707 --> 00:39:18,500
She was very involved. We're not allowed to discuss the nature of her involvement...

627
00:39:18,582 --> 00:39:21,035
- Well, kudos to you.
- Yes, kudos to you!

628
00:39:21,116 --> 00:39:24,650
I don't want any kudos, really. There was more than a little luck involved there.

629
00:39:24,742 --> 00:39:27,701
- And lots of other people.
- Not luck. Instinct.

630
00:39:27,819 --> 00:39:28,664
Talent.

631
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:31,183
- Certainty.
- No. You're wrong.

632
00:39:31,389 --> 00:39:35,551
You can relate to this. You do 90 little things right and one big thing wrong and...

633
00:39:35,643 --> 00:39:39,421
- It all just works out anyway.
- And you're not sure you know why.

634
00:39:39,856 --> 00:39:41,290
I'll definitely drink to that.

635
00:39:43,205 --> 00:39:45,412
So are we ready to order?

636
00:39:45,697 --> 00:39:48,223
Geez, I haven't even had a chance to look at the menu.

637
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,240
We've been here, what, three times in the last three weeks?

638
00:39:50,348 --> 00:39:52,012
I should have the damn thing memorized.

639
00:39:53,908 --> 00:39:54,817
Jesus...

640
00:39:57,618 --> 00:39:59,164
- You okay?
- No.

641
00:40:03,577 --> 00:40:04,458
Yes.

642
00:40:07,566 --> 00:40:09,328
Actually, it's great.

643
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:13,172
Psychic with a bad memory.
