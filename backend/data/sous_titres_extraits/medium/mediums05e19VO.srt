Who knows how to love you
without being told

4
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,500
Somebody tell me why I'm on my own

Hey, what are you doing here ?

7
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,600
Happened to be in the neighborhood.
Thought I'd bring dinner by.

8
00:00:56,033 --> 00:00:58,801
Real dinner, not that microwave stuff.

9
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,900
you just happened to be
in the neighborhood, huh ?

10
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:09,530
Maybe I didn't think
you should be alone tonight.

11
00:01:11,804 --> 00:01:13,105
You remembered.

12
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:15,509
Of course I remembered.

13
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:17,409
Today's the anniversary.

14

Marie, damn it.

22
00:02:33,228 --> 00:02:36,540
Don't get me wrong, but you seem a
little, uh, tightly wound this morning.

23
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:38,530
Yeah, well, I feel
a little tightly wound.

24
00:02:38,535 --> 00:02:39,761
My head is killing me.

25
00:02:39,766 --> 00:02:41,902
That dream keeps rattling
around in my head.

26
00:02:41,965 --> 00:02:44,643
Al, come on now, we stayed up
over an hour talking about that.

27
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:46,243
Yeah, I know.

28
00:02:51,218 --> 00:02:53,282
Hey, hey, hey, hey, listen to me.

29
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,172
It was a bad dream,

30
00:02:55,178 --> 00:02:58,201
a bad dream about losing your kids,

31
00:02:58,255 --> 00:03:01,070
and that's a dream
that every parent has at some point.

32
00:03:01,117 --> 00:03:03,170
Yeah, I know, I was there
the first time you said it.

33
00:03:03,175 --> 00:03:06,212
Then just think about it, Al.
Everything you told me about this dream...

34
00:03:06,215 --> 00:03:07,583
all the places, all the people...

35
00:03:07,585 --> 00:03:10,083
you said yourself you didn't
recognize any of 'em.

36
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:12,672
Okay, so maybe, maybe,
don't you think that maybe

37
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:14,562
that just might mean
that it wasn't real ?

38
00:03:14,566 --> 00:03:15,851
And until you... wait, hold on...

39
00:03:15,857 --> 00:03:17,551
until you see something that is real,

40
00:03:17,556 --> 00:03:20,203
that makes it real,
that's the way we have to think.

41
00:03:20,206 --> 00:03:22,770
'Cause we can't start living our lives

42
00:03:22,778 --> 00:03:24,910
like this is, this is our last year.

43
00:03:25,535 --> 00:03:27,270
We can't do that to our kids.

00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:30,533
I love you, too, Mommy.

45
00:03:31,426 --> 00:03:34,552
Marie, Mom doesn't want you
to read the notes until lunchtime.

46
00:03:34,555 --> 00:03:37,292
Otherwise, she'd just hand 'em to you
with your cereal in the morning.

47
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:41,571
It's all right, Marie.
I'll write you a new note.

48
00:03:41,578 --> 00:03:43,121
Hey, uh, don't forget.

49
00:03:43,128 --> 00:03:44,961
I don't have Dad's car today, so...

50
00:03:44,967 --> 00:03:47,802
I'm going to need a ride
to the Art Institute after school.

51
00:03:47,805 --> 00:03:50,993
They're, uh, having dance tryouts
for this summer's dance program.

52
00:03:51,355 --> 00:03:52,341
Check your bag.

53
00:03:53,168 --> 00:03:54,783
Mom, you didn't.

54
00:03:58,095 --> 00:04:00,490
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR DANCE TRY OUT.
I'LL PICK YOU UP RIGHT AFTER SCHOOL.

55
00:04:00,768 --> 00:04:03,170
Okay, you do know that I'm 16, right ?

56
00:04:07,806 --> 00:04:09,220
I don't think it's going to fit me.

57
00:04:11,606 --> 00:04:14,661
There are some onesies in here,
and I think some dresses.

58
00:04:14,937 --> 00:04:17,011
Some of the stuff goes
all the way back to Ariel,

66
00:04:46,588 --> 00:04:47,821
Why not just kill me ?

67
00:04:48,008 --> 00:04:49,301
'Cause this is more fun.

68
00:04:58,486 --> 00:04:59,303
Allison ?

69
00:05:00,025 --> 00:05:00,983

00:05:02,497 --> 00:05:04,001
Who sits at this desk ?

71
00:05:04,698 --> 00:05:07,393
Uh, most of the time,
a detective named Luis Ruiz.

72
00:05:07,757 --> 00:05:10,761
But, uh, he's been out
on assignment for about two months.

73
00:05:11,046 --> 00:05:14,372
Cloak and dagger stuff. I actually
have no idea what he's doing. Why ?

74
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:21,090
Everything I'm about to tell you
is highly classified information.

75
00:05:21,105 --> 00:05:23,723
I'm sure you two have heard
about what's going on down in Mexico.

76
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:26,432
The carnage, it's...

77
00:05:26,436 --> 00:05:28,122
like nothing they've ever seen before.

78
00:05:28,277 --> 00:05:30,902
Gunfights in the streets,
wholesale murder,

79
00:05:30,905 --> 00:05:32,801
body count's well into the thousands.

80
00:05:32,886 --> 00:05:34,171
It's a drug war.

81
00:05:34,506 --> 00:05:37,870
Two rival cartels are fighting
over territories and distribution.

82
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:41,093
And now, some of that fighting
is spilling over the border.

83
00:05:41,198 --> 00:05:43,863
Seen a rash of kidnappings
and homicides across Arizona

84
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:46,501
that we believe is connected
to what's going on down south.

85
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:50,013
Allison, that detective
that you think might be in danger,

86
00:05:50,415 --> 00:05:53,741
he's actually been working undercover
as a part of a joint investigation

87
00:05:53,755 --> 00:05:55,912
between us and
the Drug Enforcement Agency.

88
00:05:56,045 --> 00:05:58,431
Miraculously, he's managed
to get inside one

89
00:05:58,436 --> 00:06:00,530
of the cartel's operations
right here in Phoenix.

90
00:06:00,536 --> 00:06:02,490
No law enforcement agency

91
00:06:02,497 --> 00:06:05,190
has ever had a man in so deep
with one of these organizations.

92
00:06:05,196 --> 00:06:08,503
Well, that's great. When's the last
time anyone actually heard from him ?

93
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,642
Well, when a man is working
that deep undercover,

94
00:06:10,718 --> 00:06:13,731
he can't be expected to check
in with any regularity...

95
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,632
Now that man that you saw torturing him...

96
00:06:17,935 --> 00:06:20,383
Yeah, the one with the burn
scar on his face.

97
00:06:22,528 --> 00:06:25,450
Oh, my God. This is him.

98
00:06:25,645 --> 00:06:28,092
I was afraid of that. Oswaldo Castillo.

99
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,373
He's, uh, he's been the cartel's
top enforcer for years.

100
00:06:31,376 --> 00:06:36,092
Now, he specializes in the assassination
of Mexican politicians and judges.

101
00:06:36,156 --> 00:06:38,313
We've suspected for a long while
that the cartel

102
00:06:38,317 --> 00:06:40,111
has stationed him here in Arizona.

103
00:06:40,497 --> 00:06:44,170
But, um, no one's been able
to lay eyes on him.

104
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:47,530
His presence here would certainly
explain this rash of violence.

105
00:06:52,736 --> 00:06:53,852
Hey, you.

106
00:06:56,906 --> 00:06:58,562
Okay, I'll ask.

107
00:06:59,005 --> 00:07:00,600
Why are you looking at me like that ?

108
00:07:01,136 --> 00:07:03,493
Allison, everybody's been trying
to reach you for two hours.

109
00:07:05,297 --> 00:07:06,570
3:00, Ariel ?

110
00:07:06,778 --> 00:07:08,300
Dance tryouts ?

111
00:07:08,356 --> 00:07:09,362
Art Institute ?

112
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,840
Oh, my God, I...

113
00:07:12,425 --> 00:07:13,920
I was supposed to go get her.

114
00:07:15,415 --> 00:07:16,790
I completely forgot.

115
00:07:17,388 --> 00:07:18,860
It's okay. She called me.

116
00:07:19,837 --> 00:07:21,991
I postponed a conference call
and I got her there.

117
00:07:22,118 --> 00:07:24,293
I don't understand.
How could she not get ahold of me ?

118
00:07:24,355 --> 00:07:27,050
Well, she called your office and
they  said you were behind closed doors.

119
00:07:27,056 --> 00:07:29,781
And we both tried your cell, and it
just went straight to voice mail.

120
00:07:30,426 --> 00:07:33,031
I don't even remember turning this off.

121
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:36,553
Oh, God...

122
00:07:36,837 --> 00:07:37,980
Al, you okay ?

123
00:07:38,337 --> 00:07:39,711
Yeah, it's nothing,
I just have this headache

124
00:07:39,717 --> 00:07:42,080
and I just can't seem to shake it.

125
00:07:42,447 --> 00:07:43,591
Do you want me to call Dr. Berman,

126
00:07:43,605 --> 00:07:45,540
see if he can squeeze you
in first thing in the morning ?

127
00:07:46,697 --> 00:07:48,210
Joe, It's a headache.

128
00:07:48,428 --> 00:07:50,322
I know, but I'm leaving
for San Diego tomorrow,

129
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:52,391
so if you're coming down with something...

130
00:07:52,447 --> 00:07:55,151
I'm not coming down with something;
it's a headache. It'll pass.

131
00:07:55,377 --> 00:07:56,471
Promise you.

132
00:07:56,667 --> 00:07:59,723
You know, I can, I can make it
through three days without you.

133
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:03,090
If you really want to help me,

134
00:08:03,447 --> 00:08:05,771
why don't you get the girls dinner
and put them to bed,

135
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:09,491
so I can just crawl under the covers
and try to sleep this thing off ?

136
00:08:15,446 --> 00:08:17,043
Okay, go ahead. Crawl away.

137
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:23,423
By the way, she got in.

138
00:08:23,745 --> 00:08:24,642
Ariel.

139
00:08:25,578 --> 00:08:26,932
She nailed the tryout.

140
00:08:30,216 --> 00:08:31,721
Excellent.

141
00:08:40,305 --> 00:08:41,293
Sorry I'm late.

142
00:08:41,296 --> 00:08:42,202
That's okay.

143
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:43,700
You said it was important.

144
00:08:44,244 --> 00:08:45,615
Oswaldo Castillo.

145
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:48,349
I think I might have found
someone who knows where he is.

146
00:08:48,907 --> 00:08:49,499
Who ?

147
00:08:49,859 --> 00:08:50,841
His doctor.

148
00:08:51,508 --> 00:08:54,090
His name's Hector Cruz.
He's in Guadalajara, Mexico.

149
00:08:54,107 --> 00:08:55,932
Wait a second.
Where'd you come up with this ?

150
00:08:57,348 --> 00:08:59,432
I hired another private detective.

151
00:08:59,715 --> 00:09:02,673
You're telling me you hired another
private eye to hunt for Oswaldo Castillo

152
00:09:02,686 --> 00:09:05,191
after the last one took all
your money and disappeared ?

153
00:09:06,056 --> 00:09:08,262
Do you not understand that
I do this for a living ?

154
00:09:08,725 --> 00:09:09,731
Well, according to him,

155
00:09:09,745 --> 00:09:12,201
this Cruz is some kind of mob doctor.

156
00:09:12,347 --> 00:09:15,433
He treats wounded cartel soldiers
after-hours in his clinic.

157
00:09:15,965 --> 00:09:17,063
If we could just get in there,

158
00:09:17,525 --> 00:09:18,923
if we could get into his files.

159
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:21,690
He's got to have some kind
of a way to contact his patients.

160
00:09:21,706 --> 00:09:22,803
Not necessarily,

161
00:09:23,086 --> 00:09:25,411
if in fact,
he's even really Castillo's doctor.

162
00:09:25,538 --> 00:09:27,821
If in fact, he's even gone
to see him in the last year.

163
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:29,362
Or ten years or whatever.

164
00:09:29,728 --> 00:09:32,022
Not to mention the fact
that you're talking about Mexico.

165
00:09:32,565 --> 00:09:34,993
I have no jurisdiction in Mexico.
You know that.

166
00:09:35,556 --> 00:09:36,631
And even if I did,

167
00:09:36,728 --> 00:09:38,473
we don't know that any of this is true.

168
00:09:39,817 --> 00:09:40,713
I'm sorry.

169
00:09:41,316 --> 00:09:44,731
The best I can do is to pass this doctors
name along to the Mexican authorities.

170
00:09:45,188 --> 00:09:46,453
That's the best you can do ?

171
00:09:49,175 --> 00:09:52,921
Look into his eyes and you tell me
that you give a damn about jurisdiction.

172
00:09:53,456 --> 00:09:54,372
Look at him !

173
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:56,370
This is the man who murdered your wife.

174
00:09:57,695 --> 00:10:01,012
This is the man who massacred my family !

175
00:10:01,016 --> 00:10:01,991
No !

176
00:10:10,888 --> 00:10:12,053
Hello ?

177
00:10:13,555 --> 00:10:15,753
No, you didn't wake me. It's only 8:30.

178
00:10:18,005 --> 00:10:19,642
Yes, Mr. District Attorney.

179
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:23,241
Wherever you need me to go.

180
00:10:26,546 --> 00:10:27,991
What am I looking at ?

181
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:31,750
Do you remember the police officer
who was working undercover ?

182
00:10:31,758 --> 00:10:34,372
The one you were so concerned about ?

183
00:10:34,716 --> 00:10:35,662
That's him.

184
00:10:36,265 --> 00:10:38,443
In the coolers in about a dozen pieces.

185
00:10:39,887 --> 00:10:42,603
This is, uh, this is his house.

186
00:10:45,695 --> 00:10:47,803
Oh, my God, that poor woman.

187
00:10:47,808 --> 00:10:51,140
Unfortunately, this is pretty
standard stuff for these cartels.

188
00:10:51,407 --> 00:10:54,803
Targeting the families of their enemies,
of law enforcement agents.

189
00:10:55,127 --> 00:10:57,913
Makes people think twice
about investigating them.

190
00:10:58,945 --> 00:11:00,821
The DEA's going to be
setting up a task force

191
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,020
 in our offices until this is solved.

192
00:11:03,026 --> 00:11:03,901
If it's all right with you,

193
00:11:03,918 --> 00:11:06,642
I'd like to introduce you
to my colleague on the federal side.

194
00:11:06,647 --> 00:11:09,111
He is the guy who's going
to be running their whole show.

195
00:11:09,446 --> 00:11:13,781
Believe it or not, he lost his wife
to a cartel car bomb just a few weeks ago.

196
00:11:14,305 --> 00:11:15,933
They murdered his wife ?

197
00:11:20,787 --> 00:11:22,160
Agent Munoz.

198
00:11:24,506 --> 00:11:26,810
Special Agent Daniel Munoz,

199
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:28,750
I'd like you to meet Allison Dubois.

200
00:11:29,028 --> 00:11:34,111
Who knows how to love you
without being told

201
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:39,650
Daniel Munoz... that's his name,
Special Agent Daniel Munoz.

202
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:40,843
He's completely real.

203
00:11:40,858 --> 00:11:42,353
I know, I hear you,
I hear you,  I hear you.

204
00:11:42,366 --> 00:11:43,882
He's real, Joe. I didn't make him up.

205
00:11:43,895 --> 00:11:45,362
He worked for the DEA.

206
00:11:45,365 --> 00:11:47,332
Not only that, they murdered his wife.

207
00:11:47,477 --> 00:11:49,452
Who-who murdered this guy's wife ?

208
00:11:49,465 --> 00:11:50,680
Oswaldo Castillo.

209
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:52,961
He did it with a car bomb.

210
00:11:52,977 --> 00:11:54,261
He's a professional killer.

211
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:56,062
He works for this drug cartel.

212
00:11:56,096 --> 00:11:58,711
He's the one that I saw
torturing that detective.

213
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,032
This is it... this is what he does.

214
00:12:01,046 --> 00:12:04,370
He kills people.
He kills people's families.

215
00:12:07,007 --> 00:12:08,303
Well, say something.

216
00:12:08,887 --> 00:12:11,713
And we're next, right ?
Me and the kids, we're next ?

217
00:12:11,726 --> 00:12:12,980
That's where you're going, right ?

218
00:12:13,206 --> 00:12:14,991
Why do you say this like
it's a question ?

219
00:12:15,006 --> 00:12:17,293
I'm sorry, Allison, I don't know how
to continue this conversation

220
00:12:17,295 --> 00:12:18,593
unless it's a question.

221
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:21,763
How do you want me to continue ?
Like it's a certainty...

222
00:12:22,055 --> 00:12:25,261
my death, my children's deaths,
they're absolutely certain ?

223
00:12:25,276 --> 00:12:27,961
Well, hey, let's just go get
the cyanide and end it all right now.

224
00:12:27,975 --> 00:12:29,832
What the hell do you want
me to do, Allison ? Come on.

225
00:12:29,835 --> 00:12:32,183
Isn't it enough that my life
is over, but now you're upset with me

226
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:35,571
because I'm not reacting to it properly ?
What is it you want me to do ?

227
00:12:36,307 --> 00:12:37,892
What is it I want you to do ?

228
00:12:38,137 --> 00:12:39,711
What is it I want you to do ?!

229
00:12:39,906 --> 00:12:42,763
I want you to get your ass
out of that damn bed,

230
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:44,330
and I want you to keep us safe !

231
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,221
I want you to act like you give a damn !

232
00:12:46,356 --> 00:12:48,400
Like what I'm saying matters to you !

233
00:12:48,407 --> 00:12:50,712
Of course it matters to me,

234
00:12:50,976 --> 00:12:52,340
It completely matters.

235
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:54,552
But I don't know what
to tell  you to do about it

236
00:12:54,598 --> 00:12:57,622
if you're already convinced
that doing anything is useless.

237
00:12:57,787 --> 00:12:59,520
And I don't think that waking the kids

238
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:01,721
by yelling at each other
is the answer either.

239
00:13:11,568 --> 00:13:14,141
There were five ice chests.

240
00:13:14,757 --> 00:13:18,910
Each with a different piece
of that police detective in it.

241
00:13:19,335 --> 00:13:20,641
I understand.

242
00:13:20,796 --> 00:13:22,263
And I believe you, I do...

243
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,221
I absolutely believe you.

244
00:13:24,307 --> 00:13:26,542
But I also believe that standing out
in the sun too long

245
00:13:26,548 --> 00:13:27,641
 is going to give me cancer,

246
00:13:27,648 --> 00:13:28,891
but I'll be damned if the kids

247
00:13:28,897 --> 00:13:32,093
 and I are going to spend the rest
of our lives hiding in the dark.

248
00:13:32,626 --> 00:13:34,141
What kind of an answer is that ?

249
00:13:34,158 --> 00:13:36,353
That's the only answer I have, Allison.

250
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:40,080
I can't believe that our fate
is sealed, I can't.

251
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:43,393
Life is about choices.
You've just got to make the right ones.

252
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:44,460
Well, what are they ?

253
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,561
Okay, let's say you're right.

254
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,340
Let's say that we're a target
for these cartel people

255
00:13:48,346 --> 00:13:50,523
because you work
in law enforcement, okay ?

256
00:13:50,536 --> 00:13:51,472
Then the answer's pretty simple.

257
00:13:51,475 --> 00:13:53,631
You got to stop working
in law enforcement.

258
00:13:55,317 --> 00:13:57,231
- You're right.
- Of course I'm right.

259
00:13:58,276 --> 00:13:59,393
I got to quit.

260
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:02,601
I mean, I know Devalos is counting
on me, but I have to quit,

261
00:14:02,605 --> 00:14:04,502
and I have to make sure
that they know that I did.

262
00:14:04,508 --> 00:14:06,502
That's right,
for the sake of your family,

263
00:14:06,506 --> 00:14:08,601
that's what you have to do, absolutely.

264
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,902
I mean, there's no other choice,
is there ?

265
00:14:10,906 --> 00:14:11,800
I mean, if you're convinced
that we're in danger,

266
00:14:11,806 --> 00:14:13,802
if you're absolutely
certain of it,

267
00:14:13,806 --> 00:14:16,303
no, yeah, you-you got to go
into work tomorrow,

268
00:14:16,308 --> 00:14:17,500
you got to knock on Devalos' door

269
00:14:17,505 --> 00:14:19,301
and you got to say, "I resign...

270
00:14:19,308 --> 00:14:21,002
for the safety of my family."

271
00:14:23,306 --> 00:14:25,601
Of course, if you're convinced
that we're all going to die anyway,

272
00:14:25,608 --> 00:14:27,000
what's the point ?

273
00:14:30,907 --> 00:14:33,803
Which is why the choice that
I would advocate involves two things.

274
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:37,201
First, that you embrace the possibility

275
00:14:37,205 --> 00:14:40,101
that these things that you're dreaming
about might not be set in stone.

276
00:14:40,107 --> 00:14:42,562
And secondly, secondly,
that you do your job,

277
00:14:42,605 --> 00:14:45,303
you do your job as
if your life depended on it.

278
00:14:45,306 --> 00:14:47,902
As if your family's life depended on it.

279
00:14:47,908 --> 00:14:50,203
And then-then you might
be able to find this guy, this...

280
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,202
Oswaldo Castillo.

281
00:14:51,205 --> 00:14:53,601
Oswaldo Castillo.
You find him and you put him away.

282
00:14:53,807 --> 00:14:56,001
You put the people that
he works for away.

283
00:14:56,007 --> 00:15:00,202
And then, there's no reason
for anyone to kill your family anymore.

284
00:15:00,206 --> 00:15:02,303
And there's no one left around to do it.

285
00:15:20,705 --> 00:15:22,103
You sleep here ?

286
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:24,332
It's Allison, right ?

287
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:26,602
Well, I'm impressed, Allison.

288
00:15:26,605 --> 00:15:29,103
None of my agents ever beat me
into the office.

289
00:15:31,008 --> 00:15:32,901
Oh, I'm so sorry.

290
00:15:36,106 --> 00:15:37,202
Don't be.

291
00:15:37,207 --> 00:15:39,101
My wife's murder is part of this case.

292
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,902
So is this how it works ? Your thing...

293
00:15:42,905 --> 00:15:44,961
you look at a file,
hope something comes to you ?

294
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:50,600
To be perfectly honest,
I have no idea how this thing works.

295
00:15:50,907 --> 00:15:53,503
Or even if it's going
to work on any given day.

296
00:15:54,407 --> 00:15:55,401
But, uh...

297
00:15:56,306 --> 00:16:00,502
yeah, sometimes looking at pictures,
at a file...

298
00:16:00,505 --> 00:16:02,102
sometimes it helps.

299
00:16:04,107 --> 00:16:06,402
Please, I want to show you something.

300
00:16:08,807 --> 00:16:10,161
This is everything we've got.

301
00:16:12,007 --> 00:16:15,400
Had it expressed over from
my El Paso field office last night.

302
00:16:16,607 --> 00:16:19,431
Look at whatever you like.
My files are your files.

303
00:16:23,307 --> 00:16:25,601
Ariel, come on, hurry up.

304
00:16:26,108 --> 00:16:27,103
Taxi's here to take me to the airport.

305
00:16:27,106 --> 00:16:29,600
The girls are going to be late
for school if you don't leave soon.

306
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:31,102
I'm on it, Dad. Don't worry.

307
00:16:32,008 --> 00:16:33,501
Marie's doing it again.

308
00:16:33,505 --> 00:16:37,102
Marie, you're supposed to wait until
lunchtime to read Mommy's messages.

309
00:16:37,107 --> 00:16:40,100
Hey, come on, it's all right.She doesn't
have to wait if she doesn't want to.

310
00:16:40,107 --> 00:16:41,402
Come on, come on,
you guys got to get going.

311
00:16:43,108 --> 00:16:46,103
Daddy, I can't read this.
Could you please read it to me ?

312
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:48,702
"Marie, have a..."

313
00:16:51,906 --> 00:16:53,302
Let me see yours, sweetie, can I...?

314
00:16:56,408 --> 00:16:57,200
There.

315
00:17:34,007 --> 00:17:36,001
KILLED 3/10/08

316
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,003
Hi. Is this 220 Dekalb ?

317
00:17:56,007 --> 00:17:57,503
I couldn't find any number
on your house.

318
00:17:59,006 --> 00:18:00,000
Thanks.

319
00:18:06,707 --> 00:18:07,701
Oswaldo.

320
00:18:11,905 --> 00:18:12,930
<i>Tu almuerzo.</i>

321
00:18:24,808 --> 00:18:26,732
I think I know where we can find him.

322
00:18:29,406 --> 00:18:32,003
I think I know where
Oswaldo Castillo's hiding.

323
00:18:32,705 --> 00:18:34,201
Allison, you don't look well.

324
00:18:34,207 --> 00:18:36,002
Maybe you and I should go
talk about this outside.

325
00:18:36,005 --> 00:18:38,800
No, no. I saw him.

326
00:18:39,507 --> 00:18:40,803
I just saw Oswaldo Castillo.

327
00:18:40,808 --> 00:18:43,201
He's at 220 Dekalb.

328
00:18:44,106 --> 00:18:45,500
He's at an old lady's house.

329
00:18:45,505 --> 00:18:47,602
I think her son was a friend of his.

330
00:18:50,207 --> 00:18:53,100
Why are you all just sitting there ?

331
00:18:53,107 --> 00:18:55,730
Allison, your nose.

332
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:36,703
Mrs. Dubois.

333
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:37,702
Dr. Cruz.

334
00:19:37,707 --> 00:19:39,402
Sorry to keep you waiting, huh ?

335
00:19:39,406 --> 00:19:41,701
Not at all, Doctor.
Thanks for squeezing me in.

336
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,201
Please...

337
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:47,203
be patient with me.
My English is a little weak.

338
00:19:47,806 --> 00:19:51,801
We don't get too many tourists from your
country in these parts of Guadalajara.

339
00:19:56,306 --> 00:19:59,800
It says that you were hoping
to get a prescription today ?

340
00:20:00,906 --> 00:20:02,200
For pain medication ?

341
00:20:05,007 --> 00:20:06,200
According to this,

342
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:10,800
you are still experiencing some pain
from a surgery that you had a year ago ?

343
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,101
A brain surgery.

344
00:20:12,105 --> 00:20:14,900
I had a tumor growing on my brain stem.

345
00:20:15,605 --> 00:20:18,601
Usually I would just contact
my own doctor for the pills,

346
00:20:18,605 --> 00:20:22,600
but since I wasn't planning on being
back in the States for a few days...

347
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:26,200
You thought you would visit
my humble clinic, huh ?

348
00:20:30,907 --> 00:20:33,401
You do realize, Mrs. Dubois,

349
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,902
you are not the first American
to cross the border

350
00:20:36,908 --> 00:20:39,200
in search of narcotic
pain medication.

351
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:44,702
I don't suppose you would have
some documentation of your surgery.

352
00:20:44,705 --> 00:20:47,202
A MRI perhaps.

353
00:20:48,107 --> 00:20:49,803
Thank you, Doctor.

354
00:20:50,007 --> 00:20:51,202
I understand.

355
00:20:52,206 --> 00:20:54,800
I was just hoping not to cut
my vacation short,

356
00:20:54,805 --> 00:20:57,102
but actually I feel like
I got everything I wanted.

357
00:20:59,105 --> 00:21:00,902
Mrs. Dubois,

358
00:21:01,607 --> 00:21:03,900
do you mind letting me see your scar ?

359
00:21:04,405 --> 00:21:05,333
Pardon me ?

360
00:21:05,405 --> 00:21:06,202
Your scar.

361
00:21:06,206 --> 00:21:09,903
I mean, if you did undergo the procedure
you are describing to me,

362
00:21:09,905 --> 00:21:11,300
it should not be a problem.

363
00:21:12,407 --> 00:21:16,130
Who knows ? It might convince me to give
you the prescription you are after.

364
00:21:17,207 --> 00:21:18,830
For the right price, of course.

365
00:21:33,155 --> 00:21:35,753
Allison, hey, hey, Allison, hey.

366
00:21:36,008 --> 00:21:37,102
You're awake.

367
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,371
How you feeling ? You okay ?

368
00:21:40,306 --> 00:21:41,751
My head hurts.

369
00:21:42,457 --> 00:21:43,800
How long have I been here ?

370
00:21:44,705 --> 00:21:47,240
Just a few hours. Listen, Al,

371
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:51,102
um, they ran some tests while
you  were unconscious.

372
00:21:51,108 --> 00:21:54,820
And I need to talk to you
about what they found.

373
00:21:54,827 --> 00:21:56,240
The brain tumor. I know.

374
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:07,460
As you can see, you have a sizable tumor
growing in the region of the medulla.

375
00:22:07,907 --> 00:22:11,722
The medulla's part of the brain stem.
It regulates motor functions,

376
00:22:12,406 --> 00:22:15,501
breathing, heartbeat, R.E.M. sleep.

377
00:22:15,505 --> 00:22:17,612
The medulla's in charge of all of that.

378
00:22:20,207 --> 00:22:22,821
These headaches you've been having ?

379
00:22:23,106 --> 00:22:25,223
They're a symptom of your condition.

380
00:22:25,908 --> 00:22:30,200
As the tumor grows, there's less space
in your skull for your brain.

381
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:34,001
And that can cause something called
elevated intracranial pressure.

382
00:22:34,065 --> 00:22:36,752
And that can lead to all kinds
of side effects,

383
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:40,842
including difficulty
understanding and expressing language.

384
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:44,121
Which might explain the garbled
notes you told me about.

385
00:22:46,107 --> 00:22:48,471
So this tumor,
this thing inside of her brain,

386
00:22:49,885 --> 00:22:51,231
are we talking cancer ?

387
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:53,863
We have no way of knowing
until we examine the tissue.

388
00:22:53,868 --> 00:22:56,860
And we can't do that without
performing a surgical procedure.

389
00:22:57,206 --> 00:23:01,100
A procedure that we need to do
in any event to remove the tumor

390
00:23:01,227 --> 00:23:03,053
and relieve the pressure on the brain.

391
00:23:03,535 --> 00:23:06,882
No, the tumor is benign.
I already know that.

392
00:23:06,897 --> 00:23:10,420
That's good, Mrs. Dubois.
It's important to think positively.

393
00:23:10,646 --> 00:23:12,021
No, you don't understand.

394
00:23:12,408 --> 00:23:13,920
I know it's benign.

395
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:16,403
I heard you, Mrs. Dubois.

396
00:23:17,378 --> 00:23:19,421
And I'm aware of your reputation.

397
00:23:20,008 --> 00:23:23,213
But even if you're right,
it changes nothing.

398
00:23:23,607 --> 00:23:25,832
We need to get in there.

399
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:28,103
The tumor is growing quickly.

400
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:31,200
If we do not do something soon,
very soon,

401
00:23:31,668 --> 00:23:33,740
it can lead to something we call

402
00:23:33,758 --> 00:23:35,313
"herniation of the brain."

403
00:23:36,126 --> 00:23:39,631
And that can cause paralysis,

404
00:23:40,005 --> 00:23:42,603
coma... and even death.

405
00:23:43,205 --> 00:23:44,220
It's okay.

406
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,620
None of those things
are gonna happen to me.

407
00:23:50,506 --> 00:23:51,703
When do we do this ?

408
00:23:51,757 --> 00:23:52,862
As soon as possible.

409
00:23:53,455 --> 00:23:55,622
I'd like to schedule it
for tomorrow morning.

410
00:23:58,007 --> 00:24:00,140
You want to open up my skull
tomorrow morning ?

411
00:24:04,058 --> 00:24:05,361
Okay, I'm fine with that.

412
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:08,802
That's excellent.

413
00:24:13,606 --> 00:24:15,701
Girls will be getting out
of school soon.

414
00:24:17,007 --> 00:24:20,201
I want to bring them here so we
that can tell them both together.

415
00:24:20,206 --> 00:24:21,202
- No.
- What ?

416
00:24:21,205 --> 00:24:22,980
I want you to take the girls
and get out of Phoenix.

417
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:25,131
I don't care where you guys go,
just stay away.

418
00:24:25,608 --> 00:24:26,722
What are you talking about ?

419
00:24:27,306 --> 00:24:29,003
You are in danger, Joe.

420
00:24:29,805 --> 00:24:32,200
You, the girls.

421
00:24:33,108 --> 00:24:35,623
Everything I've been dreaming lately,
it's all coming true.

422
00:24:35,635 --> 00:24:36,730
Allison...

423
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:40,101
And I know if you and the girls
stay here, you're gonna die.

424
00:24:40,306 --> 00:24:42,703
Allison... you're ill.

425
00:24:42,706 --> 00:24:44,550
Yeah, now, but in the future,

426
00:24:45,147 --> 00:24:46,813
in the future, I am better.

427
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:48,372
I survive all this.

428
00:24:48,385 --> 00:24:50,632
No! This is serious, Al.

429
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:52,852
You have a brain tumor !

430
00:24:53,205 --> 00:24:55,102
You're asking me on the eve of a surgery

431
00:24:55,107 --> 00:24:58,170
that you might not survive,
to-to pack up our kids

432
00:24:58,188 --> 00:25:01,301
and take them as far away as
I possibly can ? No !

433
00:25:02,505 --> 00:25:05,081
I'm not listening to your dreams,
not this time.

434
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:06,383
- No !
- Yes !

435
00:25:06,396 --> 00:25:07,731
Hey, look at this !

436
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,603
Take a good, long look

437
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:12,800
'cause this is what that tumor's
doing to you when you try to write.

438
00:25:12,805 --> 00:25:15,802
Now imagine what it is doing
to you when you try to dream.

439
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:17,202
- I don't care !
- No !

440
00:25:17,606 --> 00:25:21,161
Your dreams cannot be
trusted right now. No.

441
00:25:21,175 --> 00:25:25,343
Hey... what if I'm right ?

442
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,410
I know I'm sick.

443
00:25:30,337 --> 00:25:32,522
And I know you're worried about me.

444
00:25:33,605 --> 00:25:38,623
but please, I beg of you, please ?

445
00:25:39,306 --> 00:25:42,422
I don't want to survive this
if I can't have my family.

446
00:25:45,505 --> 00:25:47,602
Okay. All right.

447
00:25:47,606 --> 00:25:48,933
Okay, fine. You win.

448
00:25:49,806 --> 00:25:52,041
Okay, I'll go home.
I'll take them to my sister's.

449
00:25:53,007 --> 00:25:55,100
I'll tell them we want them to stay
there so that I can stay here

450
00:25:55,108 --> 00:25:56,100
in the hospital with you.

451
00:25:56,107 --> 00:25:57,301
Joe !

452
00:25:57,308 --> 00:25:59,502
No! That is the best that I can do.

453
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:01,501
Because I need to be here

454
00:26:01,505 --> 00:26:02,600
when you wake up in the morning.

455
00:26:02,607 --> 00:26:04,503
<i>And I need to be here every morning</i>

456
00:26:04,956 --> 00:26:06,223
until you're better.

457
00:26:07,455 --> 00:26:09,303
And that is just the way
that it's gonna be.

458
00:26:15,805 --> 00:26:16,803
Allison ?

459
00:26:24,907 --> 00:26:28,433
I, uh, I heard about your illness.
I'm so sorry.

460
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:45,351
I won't stay long.

461
00:26:45,357 --> 00:26:48,422
I just wanted to let you know that
we went to that address you gave us.

462
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,750
Found a bunch of weapons hidden
on the property,

463
00:26:50,937 --> 00:26:52,102
men's clothes,

464
00:26:52,305 --> 00:26:55,020
some fake I.D.s that belonged
to Oswald Castillo.

465
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,531
But not him ?

466
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:57,901
Not him.

467
00:26:58,438 --> 00:26:59,833
We must have just missed him.

468
00:26:59,955 --> 00:27:02,103
He must have known we were coming
because he left in a hurry.

469
00:27:02,108 --> 00:27:03,721
Left behind his money, his weapons.

470
00:27:05,187 --> 00:27:06,371
This is a good thing.

471
00:27:07,408 --> 00:27:09,001
We will find him.

472
00:27:09,955 --> 00:27:11,460
I wish I could believe you.

473
00:27:12,556 --> 00:27:13,993
I've dreamt about him, you know.

474
00:27:14,996 --> 00:27:16,860
He wants to hurt my family.

475
00:27:18,407 --> 00:27:20,933
I don't know when, I don't know where...

476
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:23,832
but it's coming.

477
00:27:24,908 --> 00:27:29,212
Ma'am, I know we don't know
each other very well, but...

478
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:33,632
today you very nearly led me
to the man who murdered my wife.

479
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:36,701
These things you've been seeing ?

480
00:27:37,108 --> 00:27:38,520
I'm not gonna let 'em happen.

481
00:27:39,148 --> 00:27:40,651
You're not gonna let them happen.

482
00:27:41,706 --> 00:27:42,951
That's why we're here.

483
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:45,551
That's why we're in this together.

484
00:27:49,406 --> 00:27:50,502
Good luck, Allison.

485
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:12,701
Sir, what are you doing here ?

486
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:15,130
I got the voicemail message
you left me this afternoon.

487
00:28:16,356 --> 00:28:18,302
And you said some very nice things,
Allison,

488
00:28:18,308 --> 00:28:20,331
but I have to admit
the message alarmed me.

489
00:28:21,106 --> 00:28:24,502
All that talk about how glad
you are to have known me.

490
00:28:24,508 --> 00:28:28,101
how appreciative you are of
everything I've done for you.

491
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:30,821
To be honest, Allison,
it sounded like a good-bye.

492
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:34,402
I was just depressed.

493
00:28:34,406 --> 00:28:36,092
I guess I just called to say hi.

494
00:28:36,107 --> 00:28:38,271
I got your voicemail and I just...

495
00:28:39,037 --> 00:28:41,223
talked too much. I'm sorry.

496
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:44,800
Can I come in ?

497
00:28:45,906 --> 00:28:47,262
Oh, sure.

498
00:28:48,805 --> 00:28:50,503
You know, I know we've been
out of touch for a while,

499
00:28:50,515 --> 00:28:52,653
but I still consider you a friend,
and it's...

500
00:28:53,055 --> 00:28:55,200
Listen, I just have to ask you this.

501
00:28:55,828 --> 00:28:58,822
You're not considering doing
anything drastic, are you ?

502
00:28:58,967 --> 00:29:01,912
No! No, I'm fine.

503
00:29:01,926 --> 00:29:04,872
I mean, some days are better
than others, but...

504
00:29:06,108 --> 00:29:09,071
no, I'm not planning on doing
anything drastic.

505
00:29:09,766 --> 00:29:10,760
Please.

506
00:29:17,008 --> 00:29:18,011
You, uh...

507
00:29:20,057 --> 00:29:21,202
you going somewhere ?

508
00:29:23,457 --> 00:29:25,442
I'm just going out of town
for a couple days.

509
00:29:26,836 --> 00:29:27,831
I see.

510
00:29:29,906 --> 00:29:30,980
Can you put it off ?

511
00:29:32,035 --> 00:29:33,031
What for ?

512
00:29:33,335 --> 00:29:36,203
Because I'd like you to come to work
for me again starting right now.

513
00:29:37,207 --> 00:29:39,821
What would I do ?
I haven't had a dream in a year.

514
00:29:40,106 --> 00:29:41,101
I don't care.

515
00:29:41,507 --> 00:29:43,102
I'll hire you right now as a paralegal.

516
00:29:43,106 --> 00:29:45,730
You go back to school.
You finish getting your law degree.

517
00:29:46,058 --> 00:29:49,203
Look, as long as I have a job,
you have a job.

518
00:29:52,806 --> 00:29:53,900
I don't think so.

519
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:56,551
Allison...

520
00:29:57,557 --> 00:30:01,303
you have got to move on.
You owe it to the memory of your family.

521
00:30:01,315 --> 00:30:04,602
I owe it to the memory
of my family to do what I'm doing now.

522
00:30:06,256 --> 00:30:07,623
I could have saved them...

523
00:30:08,408 --> 00:30:09,650
Joe and the girls.

524
00:30:09,907 --> 00:30:10,941
Allison...

525
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,400
Before that operation...

526
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:16,201
I was dreaming about Castillo.

527
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:18,002
I was on the path to finding him.

528
00:30:18,008 --> 00:30:19,740
And I would have found him, I know it.

529
00:30:21,308 --> 00:30:22,403
But after that surgery,

530
00:30:22,407 --> 00:30:24,401
when I woke up, it was just gone.

531
00:30:27,205 --> 00:30:29,973
No more visions, no more dreams.

532
00:30:31,107 --> 00:30:34,400
It was like when they cut that tumor
out, they cut out my gift, too.

533
00:30:40,425 --> 00:30:42,400
If I'd just put off that surgery,

534
00:30:44,606 --> 00:30:46,940
my family would still be alive.

535
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:55,062
Hey. I'm back.

536
00:30:56,505 --> 00:30:57,903
It's good that you're up.
The nurse said

537
00:30:57,908 --> 00:31:00,001
that they're gonna take you
in for surgery in ten minutes,

538
00:31:00,906 --> 00:31:03,823
so I brought you some stuff from home.

539
00:31:05,706 --> 00:31:07,523
The girls all wrote you notes.

540
00:31:08,406 --> 00:31:10,700
on paper napkins.
They're hidden in here.

541
00:31:11,026 --> 00:31:13,100
Um, I wasn't supposed to tell you.

542
00:31:13,507 --> 00:31:15,342
What's the matter, cat got your tongue ?

543
00:31:43,588 --> 00:31:45,501
- Hello ?
- Where the hell are you ?

544
00:31:46,106 --> 00:31:48,501
It's... It's okay, Joe.
Really, it's going to be okay.

545
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:49,731
No, it is not okay.

546
00:31:49,788 --> 00:31:52,951
You ripped out your IV and
you snuck out of your hospital room.

547
00:31:53,105 --> 00:31:54,742
You're supposed to be
in surgery right now.

548
00:31:54,745 --> 00:31:56,240
Yeah, I know.
I can't have that surgery.

549
00:31:56,506 --> 00:31:57,700
What did you say ?

550
00:31:57,805 --> 00:32:00,253
I can't have it. At least not now.

551
00:32:00,996 --> 00:32:03,003
It's going to take away my dreams, Joe.

552
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:04,701
It's going to take away my gift.

553
00:32:04,838 --> 00:32:07,320
Allison, what the hell
are you talking about ?

554
00:32:07,457 --> 00:32:09,853
Look, I had another dream
last night about the future.

555
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:11,553
And now...

556
00:32:14,656 --> 00:32:17,103
And now I know that if
I let them operate,

557
00:32:17,106 --> 00:32:19,202
it's going to be the last dream
that I ever have.

558
00:32:19,206 --> 00:32:20,883
Allison, you're delirious.

559
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:22,271
You're not making any sense.

560
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:23,602
I need to keep dreaming.

561
00:32:24,857 --> 00:32:27,820
I need to find out how
I'm supposed to save you.

562
00:32:28,545 --> 00:32:31,602
After that, I swear,
I will come back to the hospital.

563
00:32:32,236 --> 00:32:33,742
I will come back to you.

564
00:32:35,738 --> 00:32:37,952
With any luck,
it'll just be a couple of days.

565
00:32:37,966 --> 00:32:40,310
You could be dead in a couple of days.

566
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:42,231
Tell Lee.

567
00:32:43,405 --> 00:32:47,300
T-Tell Lee that he shouldn't
bother checking my credit cards

568
00:32:47,305 --> 00:32:49,712
because I just used the cash
that I have in my purse.

569
00:32:50,058 --> 00:32:51,922
I found a nice place to dream.

570
00:32:52,008 --> 00:32:54,350
No, no, no, no. Allison.
Allison, listen to me. Listen.

571
00:32:54,358 --> 00:32:55,351
I love you, Joe.

572
00:32:56,405 --> 00:32:58,242
Whatever happens, you know that.

573
00:32:59,556 --> 00:33:01,250
I love you more than anything.

574
00:34:49,005 --> 00:34:51,801
I heard about your close
call in Guadalajara.

575
00:34:52,605 --> 00:34:54,820
Didn't expect to see you back
in the States so soon.

576
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:57,630
What can I say ?
I had a very good doctor.

577
00:34:57,808 --> 00:34:59,430
There's an extra $20,000 here.

578
00:34:59,655 --> 00:35:00,750
Cabrera family.

579
00:35:01,386 --> 00:35:02,900
They want to make sure
you know they appreciate

580
00:35:02,908 --> 00:35:05,041
the level of cooperation
that you offer them.

581
00:35:10,507 --> 00:35:11,500
What is that ?

582
00:35:12,548 --> 00:35:13,640
The garage door.

583
00:35:18,708 --> 00:35:19,702
Who are you ?

584
00:35:20,908 --> 00:35:21,950
What are you doing here ?

585
00:35:22,705 --> 00:35:24,560
Her name's Allison Dubois.

586
00:35:25,107 --> 00:35:27,482
You killed her family
a little over a year ago.

587
00:35:29,136 --> 00:35:31,401
Doctor's office in Guadalajara.

588
00:35:31,946 --> 00:35:33,860
You went there on your own, didn't you ?

589
00:35:34,407 --> 00:35:35,970
You left a cell number with the doctor.

590
00:35:35,975 --> 00:35:39,200
He needed to contact you to give you
the results of a blood test,

591
00:35:39,207 --> 00:35:41,421
see if your gunshot wound
had gone septic.

592
00:35:42,005 --> 00:35:45,270
The investigator I hired tracked
the cell number this address.

593
00:35:46,135 --> 00:35:47,303
That's how I got here.

594
00:35:47,905 --> 00:35:49,620
Now, what are you doing here, Daniel ?

595
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:53,802
Well, I guess we know.

596
00:35:54,007 --> 00:35:55,451
All right, that's enough talk.

597
00:35:55,655 --> 00:35:57,753
Wait a second. What's that smell ?

598
00:35:58,046 --> 00:36:00,550
Don't worry about it. Pull the trigger.

599
00:36:00,757 --> 00:36:01,990
We can all go together.

600
00:36:03,906 --> 00:36:05,300
I cut the gas line

601
00:36:05,307 --> 00:36:07,050
before I closed the garage door.

602
00:36:08,105 --> 00:36:11,100
I figure, by now,
all it will take is one little spark.

603
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:16,602
You pull your trigger. I'll pull mine.

604
00:36:17,557 --> 00:36:18,680
Any spark will do.

605
00:36:21,677 --> 00:36:22,670
Daniel.

606
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:26,501
Explain to me how you can take
money from these people

607
00:36:26,506 --> 00:36:28,333
after they did that to your wife.

608
00:36:29,108 --> 00:36:33,952
Oh, see? You're not so psychic.

609
00:36:35,855 --> 00:36:38,551
He didn't start taking money
after I killed his bride.

610
00:36:40,348 --> 00:36:42,122
He was taking money for years.

611
00:36:42,507 --> 00:36:44,132
You allowed them to murder her ?

612
00:36:45,056 --> 00:36:46,853
She figured out what I was doing.

613
00:36:46,856 --> 00:36:47,832
I didn't like it, but...

614
00:36:47,836 --> 00:36:49,461
Hey, the past is the past.

615
00:36:51,406 --> 00:36:54,600
Point is, nobody has to die now.

616
00:36:55,707 --> 00:36:56,940
We can all walk away.

617
00:36:57,507 --> 00:37:02,383
<i>And you can walk away
a very wealthy woman, Miss Dubois.</i>

618
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:03,823
I don't want that.

619
00:37:05,007 --> 00:37:06,131
I don't want money.

620
00:37:08,038 --> 00:37:09,853
I want to see my family again.

621
00:37:10,505 --> 00:37:14,302
And we all know there's only
one way that I can do that now.

622
00:37:17,906 --> 00:37:19,121
So, what is it going to be ?

623
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:23,950
You're right.

624
00:37:24,645 --> 00:37:25,822
Ladies first.

625
00:37:39,747 --> 00:37:42,080
Agent Munoz. You're here.

626
00:37:42,107 --> 00:37:43,703
Mr. District Attorney.

627
00:37:43,706 --> 00:37:46,512
It's awfully early in the morning
to be seeing you. Something up ?

628
00:37:46,518 --> 00:37:48,232
Well, we just received an anonymous tip.

629
00:37:48,238 --> 00:37:51,302
A citizen spotted someone matching
Oswaldo Castillo's description.

630
00:37:51,406 --> 00:37:53,501
Apparently, he's meeting
with two other men in a parking lot

631
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:56,233
outside a check cashing facility
in Point Breeze.

632
00:37:56,305 --> 00:37:57,302
Right now ?

633
00:37:57,306 --> 00:37:59,352
We believe so.
Squad cars are on  the way.

634
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:00,651
You can ride with me if you'd like.

635
00:38:00,658 --> 00:38:02,830
Sure. Let me just stick
this in here and I'll be right down.

636
00:38:12,407 --> 00:38:16,002
COPS ON WAY. LEAVE NOW.

637
00:38:18,756 --> 00:38:19,871
Did you warn him ?

638
00:38:21,857 --> 00:38:24,203
Allison, my God.

639
00:38:24,208 --> 00:38:26,761
I thought you were having surgery
this morning. What are you doing here ?

640
00:38:26,766 --> 00:38:28,241
I had to put it off.

641
00:38:28,486 --> 00:38:30,641
I had to tell the District Attorney about a...

642
00:38:31,265 --> 00:38:33,130
dream that I just had.

643
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:36,802
What are you talking about ?
Allison, no offense,

644
00:38:36,807 --> 00:38:39,061
but you look terrible. I don't think
you know what you're saying.

645
00:38:39,308 --> 00:38:41,703
Sir! You can come in now.

646
00:38:49,105 --> 00:38:51,401
What's going on ?
I thought we were going after Castillo.

647
00:38:51,405 --> 00:38:52,942
There was no tip.
We just told you that

648
00:38:52,948 --> 00:38:55,322
so you would be compelled
to contact Oswaldo.

649
00:38:55,455 --> 00:38:56,701
May I see your phone, please ?

650
00:38:58,157 --> 00:39:01,273
Absolutely not. This is
my private phone. I just can't...

651
00:39:01,278 --> 00:39:04,131
That cop you gave up, Luis Ruiz.

652
00:39:05,757 --> 00:39:08,380
He sat five feet from me
for the past three years.

653
00:39:09,605 --> 00:39:10,821
I know his kid.

654
00:39:12,805 --> 00:39:13,802
Give me that phone now

655
00:39:13,808 --> 00:39:16,701
or I'll arrest you for obstruction of
justice and then I'll take it from you.

656
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:17,952
This is insane.

657
00:39:18,425 --> 00:39:20,570
I'm a Federal Agent.
You just can't bully me.

658
00:39:20,808 --> 00:39:23,043
That really doesn't matter much,
Agent Munoz.

659
00:39:23,508 --> 00:39:26,003
Either you give me the phone or I go
to the trouble of getting a subpoena

660
00:39:26,007 --> 00:39:27,732
and getting the records
from  your carrier.

661
00:39:28,258 --> 00:39:30,430
They'll give me every call, every text,

662
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:33,422
and as I'm sure you're aware,
all I need to do

663
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:38,031
is prove that you forwarded information
about Detective Ruiz to the Cabrera cartel.

664
00:39:39,066 --> 00:39:42,181
And that would make you an accessory
to the murder of a police officer.

665
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:43,961
You'd be looking at the death penalty.

666
00:39:44,707 --> 00:39:46,802
Or you can give me your phone.

667
00:39:47,108 --> 00:39:49,000
Tell me where Oswaldo Castillo's hiding,

668
00:39:49,706 --> 00:39:51,231
and I might just be willing to settle

669
00:39:51,238 --> 00:39:53,232
for putting you in jail
for the rest of your life.

670
00:40:01,306 --> 00:40:02,981
Okay. We did it your way.

671
00:40:03,006 --> 00:40:04,672
Now let's get you to the hospital.

672
00:40:05,037 --> 00:40:06,030
Allison ?!

673
00:40:06,908 --> 00:40:09,323
Paging Dr. Stateman.
Dr. Stateman, please.

674
00:40:09,328 --> 00:40:10,553
Hey. Joe.

675
00:40:12,008 --> 00:40:13,000
Any news ?

676
00:40:13,006 --> 00:40:15,103
I haven't heard a thing.
She's still in surgery.

677
00:40:17,066 --> 00:40:20,552
Well, I would have been here sooner,
but your wife left me a very busy man.

678
00:40:21,807 --> 00:40:23,203
Daniel Munoz

679
00:40:23,406 --> 00:40:25,703
gave us the address where
Oswaldo Castillo was hiding.

680
00:40:26,008 --> 00:40:27,702
We arrested him about two hours ago.

681
00:40:31,606 --> 00:40:34,960
Joe, I know that Allison
delayed her surgery

682
00:40:35,216 --> 00:40:39,452
because she was afraid that the cartel
posed a threat to your family.

683
00:40:39,455 --> 00:40:43,163
You should know that
they're not a threat anymore.

684
00:40:43,168 --> 00:40:44,522
You're wife's a hero, Joe.

685
00:40:46,056 --> 00:40:47,050
I know that.

686
00:40:47,606 --> 00:40:48,702
I've always known that.

687
00:40:51,056 --> 00:40:52,203
Mr. Dubois.

688
00:40:54,705 --> 00:40:56,321
Maybe we should speak in my office.

689
00:40:56,335 --> 00:40:58,600
No. What's going on. Just...

690
00:40:58,656 --> 00:40:59,903
Tell me. How's my wife ?

691
00:41:00,707 --> 00:41:02,951
The procedure itself went well.

692
00:41:03,346 --> 00:41:04,813
The tumor was benign.

693
00:41:05,407 --> 00:41:08,131
And we were able to excise
it almost entirely.

694
00:41:08,756 --> 00:41:11,200
There was a small portion

695
00:41:11,206 --> 00:41:14,233
that had grown deeply into
the tissue of the brainstem.

696
00:41:14,255 --> 00:41:15,881
If it continues to grow,

697
00:41:16,178 --> 00:41:18,881
we think we'll be able
to eliminate it with radiation.

698
00:41:19,337 --> 00:41:21,060
That's... Okay.

699
00:41:21,068 --> 00:41:23,340
So, how long before she's awake ?

700
00:41:26,857 --> 00:41:29,532
Your wife had a stroke
shortly before surgery.

701
00:41:30,608 --> 00:41:34,003
The pressure in her skull,
it just got to be too much.

702
00:41:34,205 --> 00:41:36,342
We went ahead with the procedure anyway.

703
00:41:36,756 --> 00:41:39,272
But now she is completely non-responsive

704
00:41:39,287 --> 00:41:41,571
and she's showing
no signs of consciousness.

705
00:41:41,686 --> 00:41:44,300
And so far,
we've been unable to wake her.

706
00:41:45,357 --> 00:41:47,053
I'm sorry, Mr. Dubois.

707
00:41:47,207 --> 00:41:50,300
But until we can determine
the severity of the stroke,

708
00:41:50,305 --> 00:41:52,501
it is impossible to predict

709
00:41:52,506 --> 00:41:58,232
<i>when or even if she will ever
come out of her comatose state.</i>

710
00:42:01,706 --> 00:42:06,903
Who doesn't long for someone to hold

711
00:42:06,908 --> 00:42:12,501
>Who knows how to love you
without being told

712
00:42:12,907 --> 00:42:18,203
Somebody tell me why I'm on my own

713
00:42:18,546 --> 00:42:22,741
If there's a soulmate for everyone

714
00:42:33,405 --> 00:42:39,201
