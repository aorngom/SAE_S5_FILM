1
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,600
You all right?

2
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,300
Everything okay?

3
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,400
Allison,
everything okay?

4
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,600
It's so quiet.

5
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,100
Joe, say something.

6
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,400
Oh, my G, I can't hear.

7
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,800
Oh, my God,
I can't hear!

11
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,000
What are they saying?

12
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,600
We're not sure why.

13
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,000
She just woke up,
and, and she couldn't hear.

14
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,500
No, not a thing.

15
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,500
What are the]rsaying?

16
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,700
Wait.

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,700
No, never before.

18
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,400
Uh... no, no viral infection
that we're aware of.o.

19
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,900
No-no, no head trauma,
nothing like that.

20
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,900
It-it just... I don't know.
It just happened.

21
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,100
BRIDGETT
What's going on?

22
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,700
Why does it feel like
the middle of the night?

23
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,400
Paon me. Can you hold on
just one second?

24
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,100
It ithe middle of the night,
Brid,

25
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,600
and I'm on the phone
with the emergency room

26
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,200
and I really need you
to get back to bed.

27
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,300
Why's Daddy

28
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,600
Bed, bed.

29
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,400
Oh, really?
That would be great.

30
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,700
9:00 a.m.?
Absolutely.

31
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,600
We'll be there.

32
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,500
Thank you.

33
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,400
What did they say?

34
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,800
"...tests."

35
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,500
???

36
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,600
Oh, good.

37
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh, thank you.

38
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,100
Hey, I don't think
we should say anythi

39
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,100
?wGto the girls
until we know more.

40
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,700
I love you.

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,700
I don't hear anything.

42
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,800
Your wife's hearg loss
is rather profound.

43
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,700
Let's go speak
in my office.

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,800
What is  saying?
I cahear anything!

45
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,000
Shh, shh, shh.

46
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,200
Okay.

47
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,900
DOCTOR:
 <i>I believe your wife</i>

48
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,800
is suffering from something
called SSHL:

49
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,200
suddenensorineural
hearing loss.

50
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,700
It can be caused
by any number of things.

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,500
About, uh, 30% of the time,
people just wake up with it.

52
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,800
w, the good news is,
for most people,

53
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,600
the condition simply
goes away on its own.

54
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,600
But you're reasonably confident
that whatever it is,

55
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,100
whatever is causing it
is not a permanent condition?

56
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,400
(ringtone playing)
Sorry, that's my wife's phone.

57
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,400
Hello?

58
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,700
CYNTHIA:
Forgive meI'm looking
for Allison Dubois.

59
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,000
Have I dialed the wrong number?

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,400
No, no.
This is her husband Joe.

61
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,500
Can I ask who's calling?

62
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,000
My name is Cynthia Keener.

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,600
Your wife and I have been
doing some work together.

64
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,800
I wondered if I might
have a word with her, please.

65
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,300
To be honest, Cynta,

66
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,600
she woke up this morning
not feeling terribly well.

67
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,900
In fact, we're at the doctor's
right now.

68
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,000
Can I have her call you back?
One of us call you back?

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Of course. Uh, please tell her
I hope she feels better.???

70
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,200
Sorry. You were saying?

71
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,900
You asked me 

72
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,000
if this sort of hearing loss
is ever permanent.

73
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,200
And is it?
It can be.

74
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,100
But... we're a long way
from even thinking about that.

75
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,100
 JOE: What's going on?
BRIDGETTE: What's all
the hollering about?

76
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,400
Hey, hey, are you
all right?
Mom, was that yo

77
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,700
This silence is so...

78
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,800
It's like somebody just put
a blanket over your head.

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,700
I felt like

80
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,100
I was going to forget
how to breathe.

81
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,500
And I thought maybe if I just...
 <i>scream!</i>

82
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,500
Maybe I'll hear it.

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,900
Maybe it'll start something,

84
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,500
and I'll be okay,
but it didn't work.

85
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,300
Please don't
be scared, guys.

86
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,500
It's okay, Mom.

87
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,200
I know you're going
to get better.

88
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,100
What?!

89
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,500
Feel better, Mom.

90
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,000
Just don't scream.
It's scary.

91
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,100
Oh, I love you, too, babe.

92
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,400
???

93
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,700
What's that?
What are you doing?

94
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,800
I don't want to look
at anything on the computer.

95
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,700
THE GIRLS ARE IN BED

96
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,600
Cool!

97
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,600
Tell me something else.

98
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,000
KEENER CALLED NEED TO CALL HER BACK WHAT DO I SAY

99
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,500
I don't want her to know.

100
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,200
I don't want anyone to know.

101
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,400
Maybe you should just tell her
I have the flu.

102
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,000
How are <i>you</i> doing?

103
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,500
MAYBE A LITTLE LONELY

104
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,400
(moaning passionately):
Mmm...

105
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,700
Mmm...

106
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,200
Yeah.
Who are you talking to?

107
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,200
Hold on. Sorry.
Hold on one seco.

108
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,600
Cynthia Keener.

109
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,500
Who?

110
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,800
(shouting):
Kee-ner!

111
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,500
Yeah.
Okay, Miss Keener,

112
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,800
I'll, I'll pass everything
along to her.

113
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,600
Yeah, any information
that she gets,

114
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,300
I'll give it to you
right away.

115
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,400
Okay.

116
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,100
Okay. Hey.
(whistles)

117
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,100
Come...

118
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,400
"She has a case for you."

119
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,400
I thought you told her
I the flu.

120
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,400
"Kidnapping night before last.
12-year-old girl."

121
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,600
COMPLETELY DEAF.

122
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,800
???

123
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
JOE:
Nicole...

124
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,900
Swenson
is the

125
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,200
daughter of...

126
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,700
Of Laura and Darrin Swenson.

127
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,800
Daughter of

128
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,500
Laura and Darrin
Swenson.

129
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,000
Got it.

130
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,500
Laura's late husband

131
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,000
founded the Lyndhurst
Land and Lease Company.

132
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,500
You may have seen
thbillboards.

133
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,400
Okay.

134
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,300
She really can't hear
anything we're saying?

135
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,200
No.

136
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,800
No, she really can't.

137
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
Okay, well,

138
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,900
the, uh, Swensons'
family attorney

139
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,400
is an old friend of mine,

140
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,200
and he's hired me
to work the point

141
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,400
and negotiate
any and all discussions

142
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,100
with the kidnappers
as we work to get Nicole back.

143
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,300
What about the police?

144
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
We don't want
the police involved.

145
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,700
The family
was given very strict

146
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,700
instructions by the kidnappers.

147
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,500
Listen, I-I can't
do this anymore.

148
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
I've got to get back
to the Swensons.

149
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,000
How about I talk to you,
and you talk to her?

150
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Okay.

151
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
So Allison says she saw the men

152
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,100
wearing masks.

153
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,200
That's what
she said, yeah.

154
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,400
Tell her
that's good.

155
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,500
Tell her
that's very good.

156
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,000
That if, in fact, they're
purposely hiding their identity

157
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,100
from the girl,

158
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,300
it means they probably
don't want to kill her,

159
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,900
that they're ready
to hand her back alive

160
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,400
as soon as theget their money.

161
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,700
Okay.

162
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,200
Tell her also
that it's very useful

163
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,600
to know that they're
communicating in sign language.

164
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,000
Th would suggest
that it wasn't really

165
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,700
a crime of opportunity.

166
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,800
It was very
well planned.

167
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,900
They don't want to hurt r.

168
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,200
They, they just
want their money.

169
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,300
Okay.

170
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,000
All of this

171
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
will be very important
once we start our negotiations

172
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,000
with the

173
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,300
Thank you.

174
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,600
Mr. Dubois, uh, would you
please l me know

175
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,100
if Allison gets any more...

176
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,000
particulars?
Absolutely.

177
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,000
I've got to go

178
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,600
to the house now.

179
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,400
What did she say?

180
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,300
I feel a really bad case
of carpal tunnel coming on.

181
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,700
Testing.

182
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,200
Testing, testing.

183
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,800
But I don't understand.

184
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,100
I'm, I'm asking you

185
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,400
a simple question.

186
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,100
Well, please connect me
with somebody who can.

187
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,000
Watch your tone. Just...

188
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,800
Who's he talking to?

189
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,800
I'm on hold.

190
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,200
It's the insurance company.

191
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,300
Mr. Swenson, wou you
please hang up that phone.

192
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,200
When I'm finished.

193
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,100
We have a kidnapping
and ransom policy.

194
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,400
Now they're telling me
they won't give us theoney.

195
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,400
Well, of course not.

196
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,400
That not how insurance works.

197
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,100
They only reimburse <i>after</i>
the ransom has been paid.

198
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,000
Now, please, Mr. Swenson,
will you hang up that phone?

199
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,200
They can't help you.

200
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,400
The fewer people who knoabout

201
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,900
your daughter's kidnapping,
the better right now.

202
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,100
Come on.

203
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,300
Let's... Let's sit down.

204
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,900
I don't understand.

205
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,200
What are we gonna do?

206
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
We're gonna do
whatever we need to do.

207
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,300
Now, I know this is difficult,
but you have to think about this

208
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,200
as a business
negotiation.

209
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,900
You haveomething
they want.

210
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,600
They have something
you want.

211
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,100
We want to resolve this
as quickly as possible

212
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,400
without anyone getting hurt.

213
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
But that's what I mean.

214
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,900
What they want, I don't have.

215
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,100
I don't have five
million dollars.

216
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,500
Not just lying around waing
to get thrown into a duffel bag.

217
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,200
We will find it.

218
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,800
We're, we're talking
to the banks.

219
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,900
We'll remortgage the house.

220
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,300
That's why we have Cyrus.

221
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,600
That is what he's
good at. Tell him.

222
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,800
Unfortunately, Darrin
has already given you

223
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,900
a fairly accurate assessment
of our situation.

224
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,700
With the banks...

225
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,000
With the mortgage...

226
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,000
I think the st cas

227
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,700
we can put together
before day's end

228
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,000
is somewhere in the neighborhood

229
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,100
of three to three
and a half million.

230
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,800
I mean, if I had more time...

231
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,000
We'll offer them three million.

232
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,000
Weren't you on the same
phone call that I was?

233
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,500
They want five.

234
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,500
We have three.

235
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,600
I don't believe
they're gonna find

236
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,400
a buyer who has more.

237
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,100
How can you be sure?

238
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
How can <i>you</i> be sure

239
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,000
that they won't do something...

240
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,400
awful?

241
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,900
???

242
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,800
I mean, there wouldn't
be an upside to it.

243
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,200
There's no profit
to be made from it.

244
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,300
For the men who took Nicole,
this is just a business venture.

245
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
1
They don't want this
thing to drag out,

246
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,000
and three million dollarC..

247
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,300
is an ful lot of money.

248
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,100
Now, when they call,

249
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,700
I'm gonna talk
to them.

250
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,300
Trust me.

251
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,000
This will work out.

252
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,200
MARIE:
 <i>Mommy.</i>

253
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,200
Mommy. Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.

254
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,900
She can't hear you.

255
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,700
Come on. I'll
read you the book.

256
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,600
I want Mommy to read it.

257
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,100
But she can't. I'll
do it though, okay?

258
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:11,900
Okay.

259
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,700
Okay, let's go.

260
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,000
Hey.

261
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,900
"Is your mama a llama?"

262
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,500
ARIEL:There we go.

263
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:28,900
MARIE:
Okay.

264
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,800
??? ALLISON:
Can I do that?

265
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,900
Okay.

266
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,300
"Is your mama a llama?"

267
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,700
You guys
are reading.

268
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,800
I can do that.

269
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,200
"'Is your mama a llama?'

270
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,300
"I asked my friend Dave.

271
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,400
"'No, she is not,' is
the answer Dave gave."

272
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,100
What are you doing?

273
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,300
You're calling Cindy?

274
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,800
You can't call anybody.

275
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,600
You're not gonna be
able to hear them.

276
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,800
Cynthia Keen. We have
to call Cynthia Keener.
Why?

277
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,100
It's the middle
of the night.

278
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,400
All ri Nev ???

279
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,200
The place where
the video was shot,

280
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,100
it had a very rustic
feeling to it.

281
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,800
like a... like a cabin
in the mountains.

282
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,200
AnI also saw

283
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,800
a glass, a water glass,

284
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,300
and on it was printed

285
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,400
the name of a local diner.

286
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,900
Well, I saw a video
about an hour ago,

287
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,000
but I didn'tsee any 

288
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,600
Well, I'm not sure it was
actually in the video.

289
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,100
I think they realized...

290
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,200
you could see it.

291
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,200
One of the kidnappers

292
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
pulled it off the table

293
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,500
before they started cording.

294
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,900
It sd "Mano's Diner."

295
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,700
We looked it up online.

296
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,600
A Mano's Diner is in
the White Tank Mountains,

297
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,800
just outside of Phoenix.

298
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,600
The White Tank Mountains.

299
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,100
Hmm.

300
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,200
Well, that's the first
real clue we've had

301
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,000
since this whole
thing began.

302
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,800
Well, I mean, the glass
doesn't actually guarantee

303
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,300
that they're somewhere
near the diner.

304
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,200
ll, still,
it's a's a good start.

305
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,100
She's quite amazing.

306
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,000
(loudly):
Would you-- would you like
to stay with me today?

307
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,900
???

308
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,000
I would like for you
to stay with me today.

309
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,200
CYNTHIA:
 <i>Laura,</i>

310
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,100
Darrin.

311
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,500
This is Allison.

312
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,800
Allison's an investigator
I work with.

313
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,700
She, uh, has reviewed
the ransom tape

314
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,900
and has some
pretty strong ideas

315
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,700
about where it might
have been shot.

316
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,600
Oh, my goodness.
Well,

317
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,800
it's, uh, it's not a certainty,
but Allison feels

318
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,100
that your daughter might be
in the White Tank Mountains

319
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,200
not far
from here.

320
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
Excellent.

321
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
So, uh, what do we do?

322
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,800
Well, I'm about to sqd
some people up there right now.

323
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,100
Uh, we're going to work
as many angles as possible,

324
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,100
gather as much
information as we can,

325
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,000
and continue to negotiate.

326
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,300
Thank you. It's, it's,

327
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,200
it's just such
a comfort...

328
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,600
Um, Allison is profoundly deaf.

329
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,900
It's one of the reasons she
feels such a strong connection

330
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,900
to Nicole

331
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:23,200
and why she's been working so
hard on this particular case.

332
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,800
I know we forfeit interest
by cashing in now,

333
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,700
but I need access
to those funds.

334
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,500
That could be them.

335
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,800
Is everyone ready?

336
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,300
Swenson resince.

337
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,300
(electronically altered):
Who is this?

338
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,600
Gentlemen,
this is Cynthia Keener,

339
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,500
just like the last time.

340
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,200
I need to talk to the Swensons.

341
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,500
I'm sorry.

342
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,500
Uh, I thought

343
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,500
I'd already
explained to you

344
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,000
that that's just
not going to happen.

345
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,300
We very much
want Nicole back

346
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,600
and, uh, we're very anxious
to get this whole thing moving,

347
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,100
but you are going to
have to deal with me.

348
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,600
And how can we be sure
you're not the police?

349
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,100
You're jusgoing to have
to take my word for it.

350
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,000
Again, all I'm interested in
is getting you your money

351
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,300
and getting the Swensons
their daughter bk.

352
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,500
Now, uh, we've seen your tape.
We believe you have her.

353
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,900
How do we move
this thing along?

354
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,800
You have the money?

355
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,700
We do.

356
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,200
$5 million?

357
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,600
Three, we have $3 million.

358
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,000
But the price is five.

359
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Well, I understand
the price is five

360
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,100
and I'm lling you
all we have is three.

361
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,000
You justive us
Nicole back

362
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,100
and we'll give you
$3 million.

363
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,700
(whispering):
Tell them we'll give them
the money.

364
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,900
W-We'll figure out a way.

365
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,700
We just need a few more days.

366
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,700
No, no.

367
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,300
Gentlemen?

368
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,400
Gentlemen,
we-we're not hearing anything.

369
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,900
Gentlemen?

370
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,100
Five.

371
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,200
Three.

372
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,100
I'm offering you
what the Swensons have

373
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
and what they have
is $3 million.

374
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Cash.

375
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,000
(phone clicks)
Hello?

376
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,400
ial tone)
Hello?

377
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,200
They're gone.

378
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,800
You're fired.
Excuse me?

379
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,000
I told you.

380
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,400
We can get them
their money.

381
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,100
But we have no more time.

382
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,800
Every second that you
alw your daughter

383
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
to spend with
these people,

384
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,800
you put her further
and further in peril

385
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,700
Now, truste, they
want to make a deal.

386
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,400
They want to give you
your daughter back

387
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,800
and they want their money.

388
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,000
They want the
same thing you do.

389
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,000
$3 million or $5 million,

390
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,500
they want what you want:
they want this to be over.

391
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,700
Did you get
anything?

392
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,100
No.

393
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,900
They're going to call back.

394
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,500
How can you be so sure?

395
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,400
Well, like I told you before,

396
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,900
it's not as if there's
another buyer out there.

397
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,500
They're going to call back.

398
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,800
Well, I hope you're right.

399
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,100
I hope you know
what you're doing

400
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,400
because if anything happens
to our Nicole...

401
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,200
??? 

402
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,400
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN DEAF VERY LONG, HAVE YOU?

403
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,200
Swenson residence.

404
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,800
MAN (voice distorted):
We'll take the $3 million.

405
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:35,900
Get it ready.
(sighs)

406
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
(sobs)
It is ready.

407
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,700
Where do I meet you?

408
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,000
Not you. Have the father
bring us the money.

409
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,300
I'm sorry.
He's not available to do that.

410
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,200
I'll, uh,
I'll be bringing the money.

411
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,100
Well, then I'm sorry,

412
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,600
but his little girl won't be
available to be returned.

413
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,900
Either the father brings the
money or there's no exchange.

414
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,500
Listen tme...

415
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,500
No, listen to me.

416
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,600
I'll be calling back
with final instructions shortly.

417
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,100
At that time, I need
the father to bring the money.

418
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,700
I will be watching.

419
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,700
If the father is followed
by police, by you,

420
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,300
there'll be no exchange.

421
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,100
You'll find nothing.

422
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,800
You'll find no one

423
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,300
just the corpse.

424
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,700
Cyrus,

425
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,800
get the money ready.

426
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,900
I'm going to need an armed team

427
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,400
to follow Mr. Swenson
to the drop.

428
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,800
Lady, you follow me,

429
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,000
you order anybody
to follow me,

430
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,500
I'll come back here
and I'll kill you.

431
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,600
Mr. Swenson...
Or shall I kill
you now?!

432
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,300
Cyrus, where are we
with that money?

433
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,600
MR. SWENSON:
 <i>It's two hours.</i>

434
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,100
What could be taking them
so long?

435
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,000
GIRLS IN BED LUV U GOODNIGHT

436
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,900
Mmm.

437
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,300
Oh, I'm not sure

438
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,000
if you've actually answered
the phone yet or not.

439
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,500
Actually, I'm not even sure

440
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,600
if the phone's finished ringing
yet or not.

441
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,200
I miss your voice.

442
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,600
I miss the girls' voices.

443
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,300
The sound of the house
in the morning.

444
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,600
The way that you sigh
when you roll over in bed.

445
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,800
Sorry I'm not there.

446
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,300
Honestly, I'm not really sure
what good I'm doing here.

447
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,100
???

448
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,200
I know that I am not easy.

449
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,100
But I do love you

450
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,600
and I hope you still love me.

451
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,600
Anyway, if you're there...

452
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,800
sweet dreams.

453
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,400
Sleep tight.

454
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,900
And know that I love you.

455
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,300
And if you're not there...

456
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,900
...sweet dreams.

457
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,600
Sleep tight.

458
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,900
And know that love you.

459
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,100
Hi.

460
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,400
Allison.

461
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,000
She saw one of them.

462
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,400
One of the kidnappers.

463
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,900
She can identify him
and he knows it.

464
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,400
They're going to have
to kill her now, aren't they?

465
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,100
Mrs. Swenson...

466
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,300
I need your help.

467
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,400
I need you to convince
your husband

468
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,100
to let me call
the police.

469
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,600
What, what are you
talking about?

470
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,600
They said no police.

471
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,500
That's...
that's what we agreed on.

472
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,800
That's what we promised.

473
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,600
I have new information.

474
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,300
???

475
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,900
It's her, isn't it?

476
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,500
You, you told us
her first name,

477
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,800
but you never told us
helast.

478
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,100
It's Dubois, isn't it?

479
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,000
What does she know?

480
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,500
She thinks your daughter
may be in serious danger.

481
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,700
Now, we havepeople

482
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,800
the White Tank area
for this cabin.

483
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,400
But with police help,

484
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,300
we have a much
better chance
of finding her.

485
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,500
??? changing the plan.

486
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,100
Are you insane?

487
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,100
We're almost there.

488
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,000
We're one call away

489
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,700
and now you want
to double-cross them?

490
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,900
Now u want to give
them a reason

491
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,100
to kill our little girl?

492
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,200
I fear they already
have a reason.

493
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,100
What are you talking about?

494
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,700
What is she talking about?

495
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,300
That's it.

496
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,800
I'm going to the bedroom.

497
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,400
I'm going to try and sleep.

498
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,700
And when
that phone rings,

499
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,300
I'm doing whatever
those people tell .

500
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,300
I'm going wherever
they want me to.

501
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,200
And I am bringing
my daughter ba.

502
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,300
Mrs. Swenson,
I beg of you.

503
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,900
Please let us
call the police.

504
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,600
Otherwise, I fear
we're compromising

505
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,400
your daughter's
safe return.

506
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,100
How dareou?

507
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,100
This is not your child.

508
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,500
This is our child.

509
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,100
Darrin, Darrin...

510
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,600
Mrs. Swenson,

511
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,100
ishis what
you want?

512
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,600
She's my baby.

513
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,500
I... I d... I don't know you.

514
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,500
I don't know
this woman.

515
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,900
They said no police.

516
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,100
And we'll be...

517
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,000
We're almost there, right?

518
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,400
We're almost there, honey.

519
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,700
Come on.

520
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,900
Let's go to bed.

521
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,600
They'll come for us
when the phone rings.

522
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,000
I heard...

523
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,200
u had a dream.

524
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,400
Maybe saw some,
some bad guys?

525
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,500
Want to go look
at some pictures

526
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Maybe see if you
recognize anyone?

527
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,300
CYRUS:
Exactly three million.

528
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,200
One million a bag.

529
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,300
Thank you, Cyrus.

530
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,300
I don't understand
why it is taking them so long

531
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,500
to call back.

532
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,400
They like this.

533
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,400
Right.
They like
that wre anxious.

534
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,200
Mr. and Mrs.
Swenson...

535
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,100
omething I'd like
to propose to you.

536
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,100
I just got a phone call
from my office.

537
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,200
They have a small, electroc
portable beacon

538
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,600
that they can have
over here in ten minutes.

539
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,700
It's tiny.

540
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,700
It fits in the wheel well
of your car and...

541
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,200
it can give us your location
if anything should go wrong.

542
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,200
I can't risk it.

543
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,900
I won't risk it.

544
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,200
But, Mr. Swenson,
they'll never know it's there.

545
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,900
Looks like
it's a moot point.

546
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,100
I'll handle this from here.
Thank you.

547
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,800
Hello, this
is Nicole's father.

548
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,100
MAN (voice distorted):
Is the money ready?

549
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,700
Yes. It's ready.
It's completely ready.

550
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,600
Then it looks like you're going
to get your daughter back today.

551
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,500
Oh, thank God.

552
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,400
I need you to follow
my instructions precisely.

553
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,800
Do you have a pen and paper?

554
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,700
Yes. Yes, I'm ready.

555
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,800
Drive to Deer Valley Park.

556
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,600
At the corr of 19th and
Landale, y'll find a trash can

557
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,900
nearhe southernmost swing set
on the playground.

558
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,100
Okay.

559
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,100
Right on top will be
a white paper bag,

560
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,600
and in the white paper bag
you'll find a cell phone.

561
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,800
Okay. What then?

562
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,900
Mr. Swenson.

563
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,200
When you
retrieve

564
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,100
the white paper bag--

565
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,100
I'll give you gloves.

566
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,300
???

567
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,300
It may contain
forensic evidence

568
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,900
that will help us find
the men who did this.

569
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,800
Don't you understand?

570
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,200
I don't care
about the men who did this.

571
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:30,100
None of us care
about the men who did this.

572
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,800
I'm not going to that
garbage can wearing gloves.

573
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,600
What if they're
watching me?

574
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,800
No.

575
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,600
I just want my daughter back.

576
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,200
Oh... bring her back to me.

577
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,800
You bring her back to me.

578
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,400
You know I will.

579
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,800
It's almost over.

580
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,600
I can feel it.

581
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,200
Mrs. Swenson...

582
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,500
I'm so sorry
if me and my people

583
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,200
have made this
harder for you.

584
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,400
But, uh, quite
honestly,

585
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,100
I've never worked
with a man as...

586
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,200
determined
as your husband.

587
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,900
He just wants it over.

588
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,900
We... We just want it over.

589
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,900
I guess now
we just wait.

590
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,600
I'm going
for some air.

591
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:41,700
Keener.

592
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,700
We got a winner.

593
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,700
Pardon me?

594
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,500
She's looked through
six books of mug sho5v

595
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,500
and she finally found the guy.

596
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,800
If you've got a computer there,
I can e-mail him over to you.

597
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,100
That's terrific.

598
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,400
Is she sure?
Is she really sure?

599
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,700
You want to know she's sure,
hold on a second.

600
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,700
Cynthia, it's him.

601
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,000
CYNTHIA:
Do either of you
recognize this man?

602
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,900
No.

603
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,500
There is something
familiar about him.

604
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,600
His name is David Barrington.

605
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,100
???

606
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,400
Coincidentally,
Mrs. Swenson,

607
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,300
he worked for your husband
for several months last year.

608
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,700
Oh, my gosh.

609
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,500
Wait aute,
What...

610
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,200
What a you saying?

611
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,600
Are you saying

612
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,800
this is an inside job?

613
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,700
That someone who worked
fo husband betrayed him?

614
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,900
Maybe.

615
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,600
Maybe he still works for him.

616
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,300
Cynthia, I'm the one who
brought you in on this.

617
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,200
I've always been in
your corner, but now...

618
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,000
My husband was right about you.

619
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,700
What you're saying,
it doesn't make any sense.

620
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:52,300
Why? Whyould he hire someone
to kidnap his own stepdaughter?

621
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,400
I don't know.

622
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,700
Maybe he's planning
to use the ransom money--

623
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,200
minus what he's giving
to the kidnappers--

624
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,300
to cover all
the shortfalls at work.

625
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,400
I don't know what
you're talking about.

626
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,700
What-What shortfalls?

627
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,500
The coany is doing fine.

628
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,300
That's not what Cyrus told me
when he hired me.

629
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,300
He didn't want
you to know.

630
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,600
Since Darrin's been
running things,

631
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,300
he's taken a lot
more risks.

632
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,400
The company's accumulated
a grt deal of debt.

633
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,000
It-It still...
It doesn't make any sense.

634
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,500
???

635
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,900
For the moment.

636
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,500
Until you're reimbursed

637
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,800
through that insurance policy
he made sure you had.

638
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,100
My, uh...

639
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,900
My dad had a...

640
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:07,200
a hunting cabin...
in the mountains.

641
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,900
No one's
used it in...

642
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,800
in years.

643
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,400
He won't be there.

644
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,200
(sobbing):
You're-You're wrong.

645
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,400
You are so wrong.

646
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,500
Give me the address.

647
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,400
Let me prove you right.

648
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,500
Well, well.
The man with the plan.

649
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,200
Where is she?

650
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,600
She's in the other room.

651
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,200
She can't hear anything.

652
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,800
Yeah, let's get
this over with.

653
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,900
As promised,
one million dollars.

654
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,300
It's all there.

655
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,700
Hey, come on, man.
You know where I live.

656
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,500
Listen,
if I were you two?

657
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,300
I would get the hell
out of here now.

658
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,900
In fact,
I'll tell you what.

659
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,600
I'll wait ten minutes
before I go in and get Nicole.

660
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,400
That way there's absolutely
no chance she'll see you two.

661
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,400
Yeah, well, I wouldn't
worry about that.

662
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,900
She already has.

663
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,400
What are you talking about?

664
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,600
Well, it was a bit
of an accident.

665
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,700
Yo daughter hurt herself.

666
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,300
She screamed.

667
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:27,300
I ran inside, but...
I wasn't wearing my mask.

668
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,300
She saw your face?

669
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,900
Wait a second.

670
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,000
What are we going to do?

671
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,900
???

672
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,500
I told her aut you.

673
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,800
I told her how this
was all your doing.

674
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,100
Your idea.

675
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,200
Well, I didn't <i>tell</i> her.

676
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,100
Wrote it out.

677
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,400
How can you do this to me?

678
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,200
Do you know what this means?

679
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,400
This means I can't
take her home.

680
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,800
We dug you a hole out back.

681
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,600
Nicole...

682
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,500
I am so sorry.

683
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,200
Come on.
(screams)

684
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,900
Come on.
(screaming)

685
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,400
Come on, Nicole.

686
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,800
Nicole! Stop it!

687
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,100
Just so you know...

688
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,400
it would give me
enormous pleasure

689
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,200
to put one of these
right between your eyes

690
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,700
and another through
the center of your chest.

691
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,000
Fine. Deny a woman
a little happiness.

692
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,500
NTHIA:
Mrs. Swenson?

693
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,800
There's someone here
who'd really like to see you.

694
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,200
Mom!

695
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,300
I love you.

696
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:02,200
(sobbing)
ARIEL:
 <i>No...</i> Is Your Mama A Llama?

697
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,100
Can we read
about a giraffe?

698
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:04,500
MARIE:
No.

699
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,900
ARIEL:
Or... uh, the girl
in the forest?

700
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,700
MARIE:
No.

701
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,600
ARIEL:
Is <i>your</i> mama a llama?

702
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,600
Is <i>my</i> mama
a llama?
(gasps)

703
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,900
Is your mama
a llama?
(sighs)

704
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,100
Is your mam...is
your mama a llama?

705
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,300
No? Come here.

706
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,500
"'Is your mama
a llama?'"...

707
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,500
BOTH:
..."I asked my friend Dave."

708
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
"'No, she is not,' is
the answer Dave gave.

709
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:28,400
"'No, she is not,' is
the answer Dave gave.

710
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,400
"She hangs
by her feet

711
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,000
"and she lives
in a cave.

712
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,500
I do not belie
that'sow llamas behave."

713
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,300
