1
00:00:01,087 --> 00:00:03,005
<i>Family. It's our rock.</i>

2
00:00:03,636 --> 00:00:04,836
<i>Our salvation.</i>

3
00:00:05,843 --> 00:00:08,743
<i>These are the people we are closest to
in the whole world.</i>

4
00:00:09,213 --> 00:00:10,827
<i>They share our dreams.</i>

5
00:00:10,952 --> 00:00:12,428
<i>They share our blood.</i>

6
00:00:12,845 --> 00:00:14,741
<i>And yet it's often
those closest to us</i>

7
00:00:14,866 --> 00:00:17,217
<i>who are capable of hurting us
most deeply.</i>

8
00:00:17,654 --> 00:00:19,255
<i>"To be or not to be".</i>

9
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:22,626
<i>That was not the question in Hamlet.</i>

10
00:00:23,263 --> 00:00:24,613
<i>The question was:</i>

11
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:28,504
<i>"How could my uncle kill my father
and marry my mother?"</i>

12
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,614
<i>Is this what they mean
by family entertainment?</i>

13
00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:34,809
<i>Real life is even more frightening.</i>

14
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,579
<i>A world-famous football player
is accused of garroting his wife.</i>

15
00:00:39,327 --> 00:00:42,777
<i>Two brothers are found guilty
of massacring their parents.</i>

16
00:00:43,486 --> 00:00:46,141
<i>And the government tells us
that almost 16%</i>

17
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:48,245
<i>of the murders committed
in this country</i>

18
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,374
<i>are perpetrated by one family member
against another.</i>

19
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:05,263
Don't be afraid.

20
00:01:08,284 --> 00:01:10,434
No one will ever know it was you.

21
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,794
Everything okay?

22
00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:22,341
Oh, my God, I just...

23
00:01:22,466 --> 00:01:24,375
I just had the worst nightmare.

24
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,443
Did you hear what you just said?

25
00:01:26,568 --> 00:01:28,399
No, I mean it, it was just...

26
00:01:28,896 --> 00:01:30,980
it was truly a nightmare.

27
00:01:31,105 --> 00:01:33,252
Just, you know, a bad dream.

28
00:01:33,935 --> 00:01:37,500
Something that would never happen.
Something that could never happen.

29
00:01:37,948 --> 00:01:39,223
Just a bad dream.

30
00:01:39,941 --> 00:01:41,079
A bad dream?

31
00:01:41,714 --> 00:01:42,852
Could never happen?

32
00:01:45,245 --> 00:01:46,353
Excellent.

33
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,179
www.sub-way.fr
www.seriessub.com

34
00:02:43,877 --> 00:02:46,111
Sunday morning.
What are you doing up?

35
00:02:46,236 --> 00:02:48,008
I heard you and mom in the kitchen.

36
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:50,560
Mom's got to go in to work
for a couple of hours this morning,

37
00:02:50,685 --> 00:02:52,963
so I thought I'd keep her company
while she ate breakfast.

38
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:55,216
Look who I found in the hallway.

39
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:58,052
- Your sisters aren't up yet, are they?
- No.

40
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,791
Just me. I actually want to talk
to you guys about something

41
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,619
without everyone else around.

42
00:03:05,516 --> 00:03:09,520
Last night, after the movies, Ashley's
dad invited me, Madison, and Carla

43
00:03:09,645 --> 00:03:12,256
to go skiing at his cabin
in Flagstaff next weekend.

44
00:03:12,468 --> 00:03:14,296
That's awfully nice of him.

45
00:03:14,421 --> 00:03:16,072
- I think.
- No, it is.

46
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:19,073
So would it just be
you three girls and Ashley's dad?

47
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:22,427
Ashley's older brother
Jamie will be there.

48
00:03:22,678 --> 00:03:25,079
And I think he's bringing
a few of his friends, too.

49
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:28,541
- How much older is Ashley's...?
- He's a senior.

50
00:03:31,106 --> 00:03:32,335
I'd really like to go.

51
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,381
I know skiing is expensive,
but I could use babysitting money.

52
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,357
And they want to leave
around noon on Friday,

53
00:03:37,482 --> 00:03:40,427
which means missing everything after,
but I haven't been absent all year.

54
00:03:41,896 --> 00:03:44,398
Honey, this is really something
that Daddy and I need to talk about

55
00:03:44,523 --> 00:03:45,975
and I got to go now.

56
00:03:48,755 --> 00:03:50,962
But I promise
we'll talk later, okay?

57
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,986
- Can you walk me out?
- Yeah.

58
00:03:57,314 --> 00:03:58,657
Senior boys.

59
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:01,038
When did she get to be so old?

60
00:04:02,811 --> 00:04:04,558
Can you hold that, please?

61
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:06,441
Thank you.

62
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,126
Don't be afraid.

63
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:21,203
It was a car accident.

64
00:04:22,042 --> 00:04:23,053
I'm sorry?

65
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,305
You were wondering
about my scar, right?

66
00:04:25,996 --> 00:04:28,100
I was in a car accident
a few years back.

67
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:31,840
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
- I'm used to it.

68
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:38,684
This is convenient.
Did you all actually meet?

69
00:04:39,304 --> 00:04:41,878
Allison Dubois,
this is Dylan and Brooke Hoyt.

70
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,365
Detective Scanlon.

71
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,783
Mr. and Mrs. Hoyt.

72
00:04:45,454 --> 00:04:47,069
We're brother and sister.

73
00:04:49,232 --> 00:04:50,232
I'm...

74
00:04:50,802 --> 00:04:52,469
the official psychic.

75
00:04:53,316 --> 00:04:55,605
- Nice to meet you, Brooke.
- And you, Allison.

76
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,884
Detective Scanlon.

77
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:00,210
Brooke and Dylan are the children
of a dear old acquaintance of mine.

78
00:05:00,335 --> 00:05:02,073
I went to college with their mother.

79
00:05:02,198 --> 00:05:04,064
I really appreciate
you seeing us on a Sunday.

80
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:05,589
Of course. Please.

81
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:09,321
The last time I actually spoke
to Mom was Thursday night.

82
00:05:09,446 --> 00:05:11,101
We made a date to have lunch.

83
00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:14,188
Friday I drove over to her place
and her car wasn't in the driveway.

84
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,107
I have a key.
I went into the house.

85
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,004
She was nowhere to be found.

86
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:21,012
I went down to the police,
they said...

87
00:05:21,137 --> 00:05:23,977
if she didn't turn up after 48 hours
we could file a report.

88
00:05:24,382 --> 00:05:26,467
- We did that last night.
- We're sitting there.

89
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,488
Filling out all the paperwork, talking
to this very bored-looking officer

90
00:05:29,613 --> 00:05:31,665
and I felt like
we needed to pull some strings.

91
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,464
This woman has been gone
at least three days,

92
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:37,129
and we can't seem to get
anybody excited about that.

93
00:05:37,406 --> 00:05:38,927
So I thought about calling you.

94
00:05:39,052 --> 00:05:42,346
And I'm happy to help. As you know,
I'm very fond of your mother.

95
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,220
But the truth is, missing people
are the province of the police.

96
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:49,685
Now I've asked Detective Scanlon
to sit with us

97
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,476
so that he can liaise
with the department on your behalf.

98
00:05:53,176 --> 00:05:56,024
And I've asked Allison
to be here because, well,

99
00:05:56,149 --> 00:05:59,930
frankly, she's an invaluable resource
in these kind of matters.

100
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:01,855
But at the end of the day,

101
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:05,406
if she is truly missing, it's police
that we have to depend upon to find her.

102
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:08,282
The key phrase being
"if she truly is missing."

103
00:06:09,461 --> 00:06:11,542
Which is why I have to ask
if you're sure

104
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:13,497
that she didn't just take a trip
somewhere.

105
00:06:14,683 --> 00:06:17,760
You wouldn't know it from looking
at her, but she's not a well woman.

106
00:06:17,885 --> 00:06:21,864
She's had diabetes for years. She has
to give herself three injections a day.

107
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,144
Her kidneys are starting to fail, she's
to go to the hospital for dialysis.

108
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:27,970
So, no, spontaneous travel is not
something she's inclined to do.

109
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:31,549
What is she inclined to do?
Does she have any hobbies?

110
00:06:31,784 --> 00:06:33,017
Does she like to shop?

111
00:06:33,358 --> 00:06:34,708
She likes nature.

112
00:06:35,236 --> 00:06:37,636
She likes to bike,
she likes to hike.

113
00:06:37,886 --> 00:06:41,061
Even after she started getting
really sick, she wouldn't slow down.

114
00:06:41,572 --> 00:06:44,990
I always worry,
what if she gets hurt or lost?

115
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:46,115
I mean,

116
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,550
what if she doesn't have
enough insulin?

117
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:53,829
I'm begging you.

118
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,645
She won't even return
my phone calls.

119
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,791
Brooke,
you've got to talk to Mom for me.

120
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,082
I don't think I can do that, Dylan.

121
00:07:02,207 --> 00:07:03,680
Mom's cut you off.

122
00:07:03,805 --> 00:07:06,794
- She doesn't want anything to do...
- I know what she wants!

123
00:07:10,942 --> 00:07:12,542
I know what she wants.

124
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,140
But I need money.

125
00:07:16,325 --> 00:07:17,475
I have debts.

126
00:07:19,111 --> 00:07:21,523
Debts you can't make
late payments on.

127
00:07:22,725 --> 00:07:23,859
Brooke, please.

128
00:07:24,852 --> 00:07:27,402
Just explain to her
that I'm in trouble.

129
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:29,368
And that I will pay her back.

130
00:07:30,691 --> 00:07:33,035
- I'm starting a new business.
- Another new business.

131
00:07:33,498 --> 00:07:36,213
You've come up with yet
another way to lose money.

132
00:07:36,993 --> 00:07:38,995
- You're amazing.
- That's not fair.

133
00:07:39,228 --> 00:07:42,013
Look, I'm not talking
to Mom for you.

134
00:07:43,067 --> 00:07:44,067
Sorry.

135
00:07:44,591 --> 00:07:45,591
I can't.

136
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,708
When it comes to you,
I happen to agree with her.

137
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,536
I think you're an embarrassment.

138
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:52,411
I'm glad she cut you off.

139
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:54,869
I'm asking one more time.

140
00:08:02,072 --> 00:08:04,010
Those two have sure come a long way.

141
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,590
Excuse me?

142
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,570
I just saw something back there.

143
00:08:09,042 --> 00:08:10,531
Must've been a few years ago.

144
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,408
Brooke didn't have
that scar on her face, not yet.

145
00:08:14,252 --> 00:08:15,953
They were fighting about money.

146
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,164
It got bad and Dylan pulled a gun.

147
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:20,515
Looked like they got
along fine to me.

148
00:08:21,429 --> 00:08:23,861
Well, like I said,
it was a long time ago.

149
00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:31,233
Is someone supposed
to be coming over, Daddy?

150
00:08:31,358 --> 00:08:32,808
Not that I know of.

151
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:39,017
Hey, there.

152
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,185
Sis.

153
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:42,095
What are you doing here?

154
00:08:46,251 --> 00:08:47,601
My marriage...

155
00:08:49,636 --> 00:08:52,942
I don't understand.
You two always looked so happy.

156
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,313
I guess we're both good actors.

157
00:08:57,356 --> 00:09:00,515
The truth is, we've been having
a hard time for a while now.

158
00:09:01,326 --> 00:09:03,378
The marriage is barely
running on fumes.

159
00:09:03,503 --> 00:09:05,794
Okay.
But it is running, right?

160
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:12,711
Okay, Sara's all set
up in Ariel's room.

161
00:09:14,062 --> 00:09:17,191
Ariel's in with Bridgette and Marie.
She didn't look very happy about it.

162
00:09:17,316 --> 00:09:20,352
She kept asking
if we'd talked about the ski trip.

163
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,713
I really hope
we're on the same page with this,

164
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:27,318
'cause I think that we're going to have
to deal with this tomorrow morning.

165
00:09:27,628 --> 00:09:30,401
You mean, the page where
15-and-a-half-year-old girls

166
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:33,301
don't go on overnight trips
with 18-year-old boys?

167
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:36,158
Yeah. I think
we're of the same mind on that.

168
00:09:36,412 --> 00:09:37,993
Sara asked me to thank you again.

169
00:09:38,268 --> 00:09:41,111
It's fine.
She's thanked me already, four times.

170
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:42,746
Did I thank you?

171
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,253
Thank you.

172
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:47,489
I know my sister can be
a little much sometimes.

173
00:09:47,614 --> 00:09:48,614
It's fine.

174
00:09:49,186 --> 00:09:51,571
How many times have
we put my brother up?

175
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,161
You know,
I know this doesn't matter, but...

176
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:58,443
I always kind of liked Ryan.

177
00:10:00,245 --> 00:10:02,775
I always felt my sister was lucky
to have him.

178
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:05,187
Well, don't start mourning yet.

179
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,116
The marriage isn't necessarily over.

180
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:10,468
This very well be act one
in a very long play.

181
00:10:11,216 --> 00:10:13,552
Besides,
we don't even know if it's true yet.

182
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,972
He never seemed
like the cheating type to me.

183
00:10:16,097 --> 00:10:18,115
I know, that's what I thought.

184
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:22,355
Who knows? Maybe she'll come to her
senses and want to go back home.

185
00:10:27,813 --> 00:10:28,813
Honey?

186
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,233
Dylan, I'm home!

187
00:10:34,924 --> 00:10:36,398
I'm out in the garage.

188
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,657
Hey, babe.
What are you doing out here in the dark?

189
00:10:45,056 --> 00:10:47,056
My God, Dylan, what are you doing?

190
00:10:47,672 --> 00:10:48,814
What is that?

191
00:10:49,388 --> 00:10:50,620
What's going on?

192
00:10:51,206 --> 00:10:53,485
I told her I needed money.
We needed money.

193
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,953
Wouldn't listen.

194
00:10:56,515 --> 00:10:58,198
I didn't mean to kill her.

195
00:10:58,834 --> 00:10:59,834
Oh, my God.

196
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,247
I've thought this through.
Everything's going to be fine.

197
00:11:05,787 --> 00:11:08,392
We're going to be fine.
We just have to work together.

198
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,346
We just have to each do our part.

199
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,450
Now, me...

200
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,974
I'll take care of the body.

201
00:11:17,099 --> 00:11:19,637
I'll put it in my car, drive somewhere
far away and bury it.

202
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,898
You don't need to have
anything to do with that.

203
00:11:22,023 --> 00:11:23,023
Oh, God.

204
00:11:24,615 --> 00:11:25,615
I need you

205
00:11:26,437 --> 00:11:27,644
to take care of her car.

206
00:11:28,462 --> 00:11:30,782
It's parked out front,
we can't leave it there.

207
00:11:31,517 --> 00:11:34,437
I need you to drive it to the airport,
to long-term parking.

208
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:37,654
Just drive it in there,
lock the door, walk away.

209
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,699
Once you do that, call me
and I'll pick you up. Can you do that?

210
00:11:44,881 --> 00:11:45,944
She's alive.

211
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:07,484
You awake?

212
00:12:10,038 --> 00:12:11,245
Do you smell that?

213
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,545
Here you go.

214
00:12:21,357 --> 00:12:22,833
Hey, check it out, you guys.

215
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,451
Aunt Sara made tofu.

216
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,254
Tofu... oh, boy.

217
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,229
- Morning.
- Good morning.

218
00:12:28,936 --> 00:12:30,414
I figured while I was here,

219
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:32,750
I'd teach the girls what being
a vegan's all about,

220
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,656
see if I couldn't recruit
a couple of converts.

221
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,215
Did you guys know
that meat is murder?

222
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,960
No, I hadn't heard that.

223
00:12:42,691 --> 00:12:44,041
Can I be excused?

224
00:12:47,986 --> 00:12:49,338
I'll be right back.

225
00:12:54,131 --> 00:12:55,305
You all right?

226
00:12:56,061 --> 00:12:57,863
How long is she staying here?

227
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:00,911
Through the weekend maybe.

228
00:13:01,411 --> 00:13:03,490
You have to let me go
on that ski trip.

229
00:13:03,973 --> 00:13:05,659
What does that have to do with this?

230
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,613
It has everything to do with this.

231
00:13:07,738 --> 00:13:11,006
With her here, I don't have a place to
sleep, I don't have a place to change.

232
00:13:11,131 --> 00:13:12,802
I can't even eat
the foods that I like.

233
00:13:12,927 --> 00:13:14,876
Honey, I think you're being
a little dramatic.

234
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:16,034
Really?

235
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,307
Did you know that Bridgette snores?

236
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,547
It's true.
And Marie thinks that it's hysterical,

237
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:25,762
so she laughs all night long.

238
00:13:25,969 --> 00:13:27,097
Laughing and snoring.

239
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,640
Snoring and laughing.

240
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,058
It's not funny.

241
00:13:30,971 --> 00:13:32,845
I didn't sleep at all.

242
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,250
Okay, hey, so that's why Dad and I
are supposed to let you go

243
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,315
on an overnight with a bunch of
18-year-old boys?

244
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,444
I never should have told
you about her brother.

245
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:43,780
Right... lying... absolutely...
that would've sealed the deal.

246
00:13:44,582 --> 00:13:47,159
You know what? I got to get ready
for work, and you for school.

247
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,991
Why don't we talk about this
tonight sisters are asleep?

248
00:13:50,244 --> 00:13:51,494
"Tonight" what?

249
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,374
Your mind's made up,
Dad's mind's made up, so just forget it.

250
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:57,127
- Okay, fine.
- Fine!

251
00:14:07,415 --> 00:14:10,432
She's got no business
putting you through this.

252
00:14:10,729 --> 00:14:13,124
What are you talking about?
What are you doing here?

253
00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:15,420
I'm talking about my daughter Sara.

254
00:14:16,127 --> 00:14:19,024
She's got no business
inflicting herself on you and Joe,

255
00:14:19,928 --> 00:14:22,777
particularly since her husband
hasn't done anything wrong.

256
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,045
That man's as faithful as a dog.

257
00:14:26,445 --> 00:14:27,595
Are you sure?

258
00:14:28,385 --> 00:14:29,385
Am I sure?

259
00:14:30,691 --> 00:14:31,995
I'm dead, aren't I?

260
00:14:34,404 --> 00:14:35,917
So what are you saying?

261
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,543
This has all been
some big misunderstanding?

262
00:14:38,873 --> 00:14:41,479
This, my dear Ally, is just...

263
00:14:42,752 --> 00:14:44,052
Sara being Sara.

264
00:14:44,427 --> 00:14:46,144
I mean, I love her to death...

265
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:47,697
literally...

266
00:14:47,822 --> 00:14:49,376
but believe me when I tell you

267
00:14:49,501 --> 00:14:52,932
my little girl never saw a molehill
that she couldn't turn into a mountain.

268
00:14:54,484 --> 00:14:55,484
Now...

269
00:14:56,185 --> 00:14:57,495
you need to fix this.

270
00:14:58,134 --> 00:15:00,284
You need to get her to understand

271
00:15:00,536 --> 00:15:02,562
that she is screwing up
a good thing.

272
00:15:02,687 --> 00:15:05,448
Ryan is her one chance
for true happiness,

273
00:15:05,573 --> 00:15:07,311
and she is going to ruin it.

274
00:15:11,657 --> 00:15:14,663
Hey, no fair hiding. If I got to eat
bean curd for breakfast, so do you.

275
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:19,433
I'm sorry.

276
00:15:19,734 --> 00:15:21,271
We really need to talk.

277
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:24,868
I can't even begin to imagine

278
00:15:25,435 --> 00:15:27,842
how to have this conversation
with my sister.

279
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,205
It's straightforward.

280
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:32,167
You just tell her that your dead father
stopped by to swear

281
00:15:32,292 --> 00:15:34,266
that her husband
wasn't cheating on her.

282
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,915
Look, she's read about me in the papers.
I'm sure she'll understand.

283
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,648
I sure don't doubt she'll understand.
I'm not certain she's going to believe.

284
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:42,866
What, Sara?

285
00:15:43,801 --> 00:15:47,538
I'm sorry, she strikes me as the poster
child for people who believe.

286
00:15:48,631 --> 00:15:50,838
Oh, I got to get to work
in 30 minutes.

287
00:15:50,963 --> 00:15:53,145
So I'll pick up the girls
from school this afternoon

288
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,119
and I'll have a talk with her
when I get back.

289
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,722
Hopefully I can convince
her to go home tonight.

290
00:15:57,847 --> 00:15:59,435
Oh, wouldn't that be great?

291
00:16:01,901 --> 00:16:02,912
Mrs. Dubois.

292
00:16:03,037 --> 00:16:04,957
I'm sorry to show up
unannounced, Mr. Hoyt,

293
00:16:05,082 --> 00:16:06,770
but I was working
on your mother's case,

294
00:16:06,895 --> 00:16:08,758
and I think
I had a real breakthrough.

295
00:16:08,883 --> 00:16:10,333
Is this a bad time?

296
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,819
Come on in, please.

297
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,091
Are you saying
you know where she is?

298
00:16:14,216 --> 00:16:15,390
Does Brooke know?

299
00:16:16,364 --> 00:16:20,145
What kind of breakthrough
are we talking about exactly?

300
00:16:20,587 --> 00:16:22,689
Boy, I really don't see
a woman's touch here.

301
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:25,813
Why would you?

302
00:16:26,205 --> 00:16:28,260
I don't know,
I guess I just assumed.

303
00:16:28,486 --> 00:16:30,484
You live here with Harmony, right?

304
00:16:33,448 --> 00:16:35,111
I could have sworn the DA mentioned

305
00:16:35,236 --> 00:16:36,995
you were engaged
to someone named Harmony?

306
00:16:41,757 --> 00:16:42,987
No, not...

307
00:16:43,968 --> 00:16:46,727
for a long time.
I haven't see Harmony in years.

308
00:16:49,517 --> 00:16:52,761
Does Harmony have something to do
with the breakthrough you had?

309
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,333
Well, I thought she did.

310
00:16:54,816 --> 00:16:56,333
Maybe I was mistaken.

311
00:16:57,181 --> 00:16:58,731
This is embarrassing.

312
00:16:59,238 --> 00:17:00,977
So you're no longer engaged?

313
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:03,658
Not for about four years now.

314
00:17:05,307 --> 00:17:07,412
She broke it off just
before the wedding.

315
00:17:08,566 --> 00:17:09,816
Sent me a note,

316
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,964
said she was leaving the country.

317
00:17:13,015 --> 00:17:14,827
I haven't seen her since.

318
00:17:16,873 --> 00:17:18,619
I don't understand,
are you suggesting

319
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:21,414
that she might've had something to do
with my mother's disappearance?

320
00:17:21,932 --> 00:17:24,876
I don't know what I'm saying.
I'm sorry for wasting your time.

321
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,625
I'm confused, though,
like, I just, I mean...

322
00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:30,821
at least tell me what brought
you here this morning.

323
00:17:30,946 --> 00:17:32,523
I don't know that it matters,

324
00:17:32,648 --> 00:17:35,804
but I got this picture in my head about
the night that your mom disappeared.

325
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,806
And yeah,
there was someone named Harmony in it.

326
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,725
Although...

327
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,440
that makes no sense and...

328
00:17:42,914 --> 00:17:44,229
and actually you were in it.

329
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:45,991
Okay, well, that...

330
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,899
I'm sorry,
but that is crazy 'cause...

331
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:51,369
like I said,
I haven't seen her in forever.

332
00:17:51,801 --> 00:17:53,511
Besides, I was at Brooke's,

333
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,633
talking about Mom, actually...

334
00:17:55,758 --> 00:17:57,176
her health, everything.

335
00:17:58,257 --> 00:17:59,412
Kind of ironic.

336
00:18:00,742 --> 00:18:02,059
Got pretty drunk.

337
00:18:03,024 --> 00:18:05,625
We both did. I ended up staying
the night, she didn't want me driving.

338
00:18:08,137 --> 00:18:09,310
I'm plastered...

339
00:18:09,592 --> 00:18:11,690
we're both plastered...
and our mom is...

340
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:16,594
I'm sorry for getting your hopes up,
Mr. Hoyt.

341
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:19,292
Don't be.

342
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,141
Knock-knock.

343
00:18:24,334 --> 00:18:25,311
Can I come in?

344
00:18:25,746 --> 00:18:27,046
Pull up a chair.

345
00:18:28,852 --> 00:18:31,952
So I thought about what you said,
about your dream,

346
00:18:32,746 --> 00:18:36,119
about Dylan and the fiancée killing
the mom, about how that made no sense

347
00:18:36,244 --> 00:18:37,573
since there is no fiancée,

348
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:40,681
about how he's got an airtight alibi
'cause he was with his sister all night,

349
00:18:40,806 --> 00:18:42,460
so I did a little research.

350
00:18:42,585 --> 00:18:45,771
You want to see something else
that doesn't make a whole lot of sense?

351
00:18:52,061 --> 00:18:53,394
You know what that is?

352
00:18:55,345 --> 00:18:58,265
Of course I know what it is.
It's a restraining order.

353
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,351
It's a restraining order you took
out against your brother in 2004.

354
00:19:03,334 --> 00:19:04,934
Apparently he pulled a gun on you.

355
00:19:05,576 --> 00:19:06,576
He did.

356
00:19:06,825 --> 00:19:10,537
And yet, according to him, he was with
you the night your mother disappeared.

357
00:19:10,969 --> 00:19:13,756
In fact, you invited him to stay over...
the man that...

358
00:19:14,123 --> 00:19:17,781
pulled a gun on you, the man that
you took a restraing order out against?

359
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:19,156
It's true.

360
00:19:19,574 --> 00:19:21,002
He'd had too much to drink.

361
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:23,560
I told him to spend the night
in my guest room.

362
00:19:24,072 --> 00:19:26,713
It's also true that
there was a period in my life

363
00:19:26,838 --> 00:19:28,701
when I was terrified of my brother.

364
00:19:29,765 --> 00:19:31,635
Thankfully, that's ancient history.

365
00:19:34,728 --> 00:19:37,967
Are you suggesting he's somehow involved
in my mom's disappearance?

366
00:19:39,726 --> 00:19:43,419
Well, from what we know about them,
from what we know about him,

367
00:19:43,544 --> 00:19:45,181
it's obviously crossed our minds.

368
00:19:45,306 --> 00:19:47,227
I swear to you, he was with me.

369
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,323
The thing you need to understand,
Detective...

370
00:19:50,448 --> 00:19:52,398
the thing you both
need to understand...

371
00:19:52,523 --> 00:19:56,486
is that my brother isn't the same man
he once was. He's changed.

372
00:19:56,883 --> 00:19:59,279
- What do you mean?
- Do you remember when we first met,

373
00:19:59,578 --> 00:20:01,428
I mentioned a car accident?

374
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:05,153
I was in the hospital
for over a year.

375
00:20:05,512 --> 00:20:07,200
I had multiple surgeries,

376
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,069
months of rehab.

377
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,024
Dylan practically took up
residence in my hospital room.

378
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:16,082
He was with me
every step of the way.

379
00:20:17,065 --> 00:20:18,439
In a strange way,

380
00:20:18,564 --> 00:20:20,615
my nearly dying changed everything.

381
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,140
Everything bad between us just...

382
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,290
dissolved.

383
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:28,601
What about your mom?
What was it like between her and Dylan?

384
00:20:29,756 --> 00:20:31,771
My mother has always
been very hard on Dylan.

385
00:20:34,092 --> 00:20:36,807
At one point,
she actually removed him from the will.

386
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,271
That said,

387
00:20:39,611 --> 00:20:42,388
Dylan's really been trying
to mend fences with her.

388
00:20:42,989 --> 00:20:45,403
When Mom had to start dialysis
this past winter,

389
00:20:45,528 --> 00:20:48,574
he got himself tested to see
if he could donate one of his kidneys.

390
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:52,777
It wasn't a match, but I think it meant
a lot to her that he'd even be willing.

391
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:55,628
I'm sorry.

392
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,568
I know you're working very hard
to try and find my mother, but...

393
00:20:58,693 --> 00:21:01,509
if you think Dylan had anything to do
with her disappearance...

394
00:21:16,077 --> 00:21:17,776
What are you guys watching?

395
00:21:18,113 --> 00:21:20,445
Aunt Sara says it's
called reality TV.

396
00:21:21,415 --> 00:21:22,683
Come on, Al, sit.

397
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,537
Help us decide which one of
these attention-starved wackadoos

398
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:28,534
has the scariest boob job.

399
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:30,999
No, that's okay.

400
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:33,882
I'm just going to get out of these
clothes, grab something to eat.

401
00:21:38,522 --> 00:21:41,723
Did you and Joe
have a chance to talk?

402
00:21:42,048 --> 00:21:43,048
Sure did.

403
00:21:46,748 --> 00:21:47,748
Great.

404
00:21:58,445 --> 00:22:00,743
Is this the only place you could find
to do your homework?

405
00:22:00,868 --> 00:22:01,879
Yeah.

406
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:05,365
- Well, what about your bedroom?
- Aunt Sara's stuff's all over my desk.

407
00:22:06,554 --> 00:22:09,044
- Well, the kitchen?
- I can't concentrate.

408
00:22:09,354 --> 00:22:11,410
They're watching some heinous show.

409
00:22:12,002 --> 00:22:15,206
And now that I know that I'm going
to school all day Friday,

410
00:22:15,331 --> 00:22:18,029
instead of leaving in the middle of
the day to go on a ski trip,

411
00:22:18,154 --> 00:22:20,046
I have a lot
of extra homework to do.

412
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:23,949
Do you know where your father is?

413
00:22:24,221 --> 00:22:25,404
In the shower.

414
00:22:25,855 --> 00:22:26,855
Great.

415
00:22:29,692 --> 00:22:31,731
It's not
that she doesn't believe you.

416
00:22:32,067 --> 00:22:34,171
It's not
that she doesn't believe in you.

417
00:22:34,841 --> 00:22:37,287
It turns out,
she just doesn't believe my dad.

418
00:22:37,412 --> 00:22:39,419
She never has, and she never will.

419
00:22:39,544 --> 00:22:42,377
Great. I'm dealing with a ghost
with a credibility problem.

420
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,059
She just kept asking me,
"If Ryan's such a decent guy,

421
00:22:45,184 --> 00:22:47,098
"then how come
he hasn't shown up here?

422
00:22:47,223 --> 00:22:50,910
"How come he isn't pounding on the front
door, begging me to come back?

423
00:22:51,035 --> 00:22:52,868
"How come he hasn't even called?"

424
00:22:53,316 --> 00:22:56,436
And you know what?
I mean, I don't have an answer for that.

425
00:22:56,561 --> 00:22:58,480
Well, maybe you should go see him.

426
00:22:58,605 --> 00:23:00,629
Encourage him
to make the first move.

427
00:23:01,077 --> 00:23:04,162
No, I don't want to do that.
This is my sister's marriage.

428
00:23:04,476 --> 00:23:07,135
It would make me really uncomfortable
to get in the middle of all that.

429
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:10,438
Well, it might be your sister's
marriage, but this is our house.

430
00:23:10,786 --> 00:23:13,717
We got to do something.
Ariel's camped out in the hall,

431
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:17,216
and our other children are being
force-fed tofu and reality TV.

432
00:23:19,142 --> 00:23:21,733
All right,
I guess I could drop in on Ryan.

433
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,500
Harmony, you okay?

434
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,771
<i>I don't know. I think so.</i>

435
00:23:40,573 --> 00:23:42,373
I'm almost at the airport.

436
00:23:45,001 --> 00:23:48,620
Are you really sure that I'm not going
to wind up on some security camera?

437
00:23:48,832 --> 00:23:50,747
<i>They tape over
that footage all the time.</i>

438
00:23:50,872 --> 00:23:53,593
<i>Nobody's gonna notice the car
there for weeks, believe me.</i>

439
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:55,759
<i>Everything's gonna be fine, Harmony.</i>

440
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:59,004
<i>I'm almost done here.
Just do like we said. Drop off the car,</i>

441
00:23:59,129 --> 00:24:01,310
<i>and I'll pick you up
at Terminal Two, all right?</i>

442
00:24:01,435 --> 00:24:02,435
Okay.

443
00:24:15,852 --> 00:24:18,862
Sir, I really need to speak with you.
I'm very worried about Brooke Hoyt.

444
00:24:18,987 --> 00:24:21,136
Sorry, Allison.
It's going to have to wait.

445
00:24:21,754 --> 00:24:23,441
Brooke's mother, Felicia...
they...

446
00:24:23,566 --> 00:24:26,089
They just found her body at
South Mountain Park this morning.

447
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:27,606
I'm so sorry.

448
00:24:28,397 --> 00:24:31,001
I actually just got off the phone
with Brooke. I'm meeting her and Dylan

449
00:24:31,126 --> 00:24:32,934
at the city morgue
so that they can make

450
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:35,223
an official identification
of their mother's body.

451
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,142
Did you just say you were
just talking to Brooke?

452
00:24:41,317 --> 00:24:45,108
A park ranger found her at the bottom of
a cliff in a remote area of Pima Canyon.

453
00:24:45,712 --> 00:24:48,188
They figured she slipped
and fell during a walk,

454
00:24:48,433 --> 00:24:50,613
- but the coroner thinks otherwise.
- What do you mean?

455
00:24:52,316 --> 00:24:55,001
There was no blood spatter
where the body landed.

456
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,659
A living person falling from that height
would have popped like a balloon.

457
00:24:58,784 --> 00:25:00,408
Mrs. Hoyt, on the other hand...

458
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:03,598
What are you telling me? She was already
dead before she went over that cliff?

459
00:25:03,723 --> 00:25:06,152
No. I'm telling you
she was already murdered.

460
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:09,763
The coroner says she was dead at least
an hour before her body hit those rocks.

461
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,752
That means somebody
took her to that park.

462
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:13,803
That means somebody
threw her off that cliff.

463
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,123
Probably wanted to make her death
look like an accident.

464
00:25:17,248 --> 00:25:20,272
Good news is, they found a few chunks
of skin under Mrs. Hoyt's fingernails,

465
00:25:20,397 --> 00:25:23,813
which would seem to suggest that
she put up a fight before she died.

466
00:25:24,382 --> 00:25:26,815
With any luck, we'll find out
who she was fighting with

467
00:25:27,096 --> 00:25:28,646
once we run that DNA.

468
00:25:29,798 --> 00:25:31,879
You know,
it's not polite to stare, Allison.

469
00:25:32,004 --> 00:25:34,644
I can't help it.
I had another dream last night.

470
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:38,460
Dylan was burying a body in the desert,
only it wasn't his mother.

471
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,168
It was his sister.

472
00:25:41,075 --> 00:25:42,175
That sister?

473
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:46,544
I don't know.
She looks pretty spry to me.

474
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:51,631
This conversation
is kind of tricky for me.

475
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,070
You know,
we're talking about your sister here.

476
00:25:54,195 --> 00:25:56,436
And I know you love her,
and I love her, too.

477
00:25:56,561 --> 00:25:57,561
But...

478
00:25:57,859 --> 00:26:00,308
the truth is, she can be exhausting.

479
00:26:00,735 --> 00:26:02,161
No. Believe me, I know.

480
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:06,386
I'm tired of always having
to be the adult in the relationship.

481
00:26:07,797 --> 00:26:10,559
I'm tired of having to clean up messes
I didn't make.

482
00:26:10,684 --> 00:26:13,535
Look, the thing is that I know
that she wants to make it work.

483
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,516
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

484
00:26:15,899 --> 00:26:18,904
She just needs a little nudge, you know?
A gesture or something.

485
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:21,954
Maybe if you came by the house
to see her, or if you just called her.

486
00:26:22,703 --> 00:26:26,011
I think that's all that it would take,
really, to get her to come home.

487
00:26:26,136 --> 00:26:27,422
I'm sure you're right.

488
00:26:27,547 --> 00:26:30,990
I'm sure that if I made the effort, Sara
would be perfectly willing to forgive me

489
00:26:31,115 --> 00:26:33,257
for the fact that
she walked out on me.

490
00:26:34,715 --> 00:26:37,166
Look, I'm not trying to be
a hard-ass here,

491
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,348
but she left me,
not the other way around, okay?

492
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:43,971
Would I take her back?

493
00:26:44,173 --> 00:26:45,173
Sure.

494
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:48,129
It's not like I've changed
the locks or anything.

495
00:26:48,254 --> 00:26:50,316
She can come home anytime she wants.

496
00:26:50,882 --> 00:26:54,886
But between you and me, she's put me
through this way too many times.

497
00:26:56,507 --> 00:26:58,607
Your sister digs the drama, Joe.

498
00:26:59,127 --> 00:27:01,268
Me? I'm tired of it.

499
00:27:13,988 --> 00:27:16,627
Sorry.
I forgot to get that validated.

500
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,211
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

501
00:27:35,172 --> 00:27:37,266
Well, it didn't look innocent to me.

502
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,757
It didn't look like hand-holding.
More like hand-caressing.

503
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,659
What are you going to do?

504
00:27:42,889 --> 00:27:43,995
I don't know.

505
00:27:44,392 --> 00:27:46,525
I mean, if Ryan really is cheating,
then,

506
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,861
why would Dad say
that he's being faithful?

507
00:27:49,674 --> 00:27:52,336
Why would he want his daughter to go
back to somebody who's betraying her?

508
00:27:55,595 --> 00:27:57,534
I think I got to tell her
what I saw.

509
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,856
I'll take her out tomorrow night,

510
00:28:00,981 --> 00:28:03,342
get away from the house,
away from the kids, right?

511
00:28:03,467 --> 00:28:05,046
So she doesn't make a scene.

512
00:28:16,754 --> 00:28:19,020
We just got a match
on the DNA we found

513
00:28:19,145 --> 00:28:21,032
under Felicia Hoyt's fingernails.

514
00:28:22,046 --> 00:28:24,788
Turns out,
it belongs to Harmony Fletcher.

515
00:28:25,876 --> 00:28:27,856
Harmony, Dylan's old fiancée?

516
00:28:28,181 --> 00:28:30,415
<i>Yup. Seems she got arrested</i>

517
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,976
for a DUI a while back, so her prints
and DNA were in the system.

518
00:28:34,409 --> 00:28:35,713
It's a perfect match.

519
00:28:35,963 --> 00:28:39,574
Well, I don't understand. I thought
nobody had heard from Harmony in years.

520
00:28:39,699 --> 00:28:42,431
- I thought she left the country.
- <i>So did everyone else.</i>

521
00:28:42,713 --> 00:28:44,250
<i>Devalos just spoke with Dylan again.</i>

522
00:28:44,375 --> 00:28:46,950
<i>He swears he's had no contact
with her since she left him.</i>

523
00:28:47,173 --> 00:28:50,162
<i>Says he has no idea
why she'd want to kill his mother.</i>

524
00:28:51,351 --> 00:28:54,693
Of course, Mr. Devalos. If Harmony
contacts me, I'll call you right away.

525
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:55,818
Thank you.

526
00:28:57,969 --> 00:28:59,269
What did he say?

527
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,944
They identified the DNA
they found on Mom's body.

528
00:29:05,332 --> 00:29:07,078
They think it was Harmony Fletcher.

529
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,124
They've launched
a statewide manhunt for her.

530
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:15,498
That's a good thing, right?

531
00:29:16,956 --> 00:29:18,806
Actually, I'd say that's...

532
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,774
better than good.

533
00:29:22,745 --> 00:29:24,495
I'd say that's fantastic.

534
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,352
I told you it was
going to be all right.

535
00:29:42,417 --> 00:29:43,767
She didn't do it.

536
00:29:44,904 --> 00:29:48,088
Harmony Fletcher didn't
kill Felicia Hoyt.

537
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:49,931
Dylan and Brooke did.

538
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:52,104
- Beg your pardon?
- Look, I'm sorry,

539
00:29:52,229 --> 00:29:54,106
I know that Felicia was your friend.

540
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:57,650
But I'm telling you, something
peculiar is going on with her children.

541
00:29:58,304 --> 00:29:59,421
Last night...

542
00:30:00,485 --> 00:30:02,049
I saw them kissing.

543
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:04,472
On the lips.

544
00:30:04,597 --> 00:30:06,232
For a very long time.

545
00:30:07,337 --> 00:30:08,764
I think that they're lovers.

546
00:30:09,177 --> 00:30:11,027
When you say yousaw, you...

547
00:30:11,427 --> 00:30:13,472
Okay, I didn't see it.
I dreamt it.

548
00:30:13,597 --> 00:30:15,247
But what if it is true?

549
00:30:15,645 --> 00:30:18,065
What if Felicia found out?
What if she confronted them?

550
00:30:18,428 --> 00:30:20,692
Look, I know
that the DNA is telling us that

551
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:22,454
Harmony killed Felicia,

552
00:30:23,192 --> 00:30:26,043
but what if Dylan and Brooke figured out
a way to...

553
00:30:26,168 --> 00:30:28,447
plant it there so that we would think
it was Harmony?

554
00:30:28,572 --> 00:30:30,451
Allison, it's not just the DNA.

555
00:30:30,576 --> 00:30:32,788
Harmony Fletcher confessed
to Felicia's murder.

556
00:30:33,918 --> 00:30:35,515
What do you mean?
You found her?

557
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,809
Well, not exactly.

558
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:39,571
Dylan Hoyt found this
on his doorstep this morning.

559
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,857
It's from Harmony,
confessing to everything.

560
00:30:41,982 --> 00:30:44,583
Harmony Fletcher didn't leave Dylan
at the altar 'cause of cold feet.

561
00:30:44,708 --> 00:30:46,594
She left him 'cause of cold cash.

562
00:30:46,816 --> 00:30:49,260
Apparently, Felicia Hoyt didn't approve
of Dylan's fiancée,

563
00:30:49,385 --> 00:30:51,686
so she offered her $100,000
to leave town.

564
00:30:53,144 --> 00:30:56,436
Harmony took it and never looked back,
at least until four days ago.

565
00:30:56,652 --> 00:30:58,070
She'd run out of money.

566
00:30:58,286 --> 00:31:01,358
When Felicia refused to give her
another cent, things got heated.

567
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,713
Harmony hit her over the head
with a crystal paperweight.

568
00:31:03,838 --> 00:31:07,240
When she realized she'd killed her,
she dressed Felicia in hiking clothes,

569
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:10,674
drove her car to South Mountain Park,
pitched her body over that cliff.

570
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,871
This doesn't make any sense.
Why would she leave this note for Dylan?

571
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:17,930
If she did everything that this letter
claims that she did, where is she now?

572
00:31:18,055 --> 00:31:20,293
- I think this is a fake.
- No, it's real, Allison.

573
00:31:20,418 --> 00:31:22,887
We compared that signature
to the one on her release papers

574
00:31:23,012 --> 00:31:25,993
from her DUI arrest a few years back.
It's a perfect match.

575
00:31:26,118 --> 00:31:28,126
And her fingerprints
are all over that paper,

576
00:31:28,251 --> 00:31:30,260
and according
to preliminary DNA tests,

577
00:31:30,385 --> 00:31:32,802
her saliva sealed
the envelope it came in.

578
00:31:38,409 --> 00:31:39,864
Rough day, Ally?

579
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:42,314
Yeah, as a matter of fact, it was.

580
00:31:42,439 --> 00:31:44,990
It was a rough night, too,
now that you mention it.

581
00:31:45,699 --> 00:31:48,394
You want to know why, or are you already
ahead of me on that one?

582
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:51,228
Well, if you're referring to the fact
that Sara's husband

583
00:31:51,353 --> 00:31:54,204
appears to be giving more
than just dictation

584
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,072
to his comely young assistant,

585
00:31:56,197 --> 00:31:58,249
yeah, I guess I'm ahead of you.

586
00:31:59,173 --> 00:32:01,460
Truth be told,
I've been ahead of you all along.

587
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:05,130
But you got to understand. There's a
reason I haven't been truthful with you.

588
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:07,433
Sara's pregnant?!

589
00:32:08,485 --> 00:32:11,342
Your dad said she's three weeks along.
She doesn't even know yet.

590
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:15,030
I hate this. So now what?
What am I... 

591
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:19,030
I'm about to take her out to dinner and
tell her that her husband is a cheater.

592
00:32:19,326 --> 00:32:21,497
I have no idea what
I'm supposed to do now.

593
00:32:21,622 --> 00:32:24,108
Your dad really doesn't want you
to have that dinner.

594
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:28,358
He swears that once Sara learns
that she's pregnant,

595
00:32:28,483 --> 00:32:31,457
once she and Ryan realize
they're going to be parents,

596
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:33,912
that'll go a long way
to fixing their marriage.

597
00:32:34,037 --> 00:32:35,794
That he'll end the affair.

598
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,998
He says...
Your dad says they'll actually be happy.

599
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,902
- So he doesn't want me to tell her?
- Your father's absolutely convinced

600
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:44,165
that if Sara finds out that Ryan's been
cheating on her,

601
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,686
they'll be a big blowup.

602
00:32:46,043 --> 00:32:47,339
That'll be it for them.

603
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,591
They'll do the kind of damage
that can't be undone,

604
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,310
baby or no baby.

605
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,669
That's why your father lied to me.

606
00:32:53,923 --> 00:32:57,445
And that's why you can't tell Sara
that Ryan's been cheating on her.

607
00:33:00,339 --> 00:33:03,606
Wait, where are you going? You're not
going to say anything to her, are you?

608
00:33:04,892 --> 00:33:07,434
Well, I gotta tell her
that we're not going to dinner.

609
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:08,880
And the rest of it...

610
00:33:09,293 --> 00:33:10,793
I gotta sleep on it.

611
00:33:13,887 --> 00:33:17,136
Are you really sure I'm not going to
wind up on some security camera?

612
00:33:18,026 --> 00:33:19,905
<i>They tape over
that footage all the time.</i>

613
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:22,808
<i>Nobody's even going to notice
the car there for weeks. Believe me.</i>

614
00:33:22,933 --> 00:33:26,272
<i>Harmony, it's all going to be okay,
all right? I'm almost done here.</i>

615
00:33:26,397 --> 00:33:30,075
<i>Just do like we said: dump the car,
and I'll pick you up at Terminal Two.</i>

616
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,200
Okay.

617
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:41,318
<i>We're just a few weeks away
from the midterm elections,</i>

618
00:33:41,443 --> 00:33:44,604
<i>and polling data indicates
that the incumbent Republicans</i>

619
00:33:44,774 --> 00:33:47,982
<i>will be lucky to escape 2006
with their...</i>

620
00:33:58,452 --> 00:33:59,694
What's going on?

621
00:34:00,086 --> 00:34:01,086
You okay?

622
00:34:02,236 --> 00:34:04,188
It's nothing.
Just a bad dream.

623
00:34:04,714 --> 00:34:06,195
You need to call anyone?

624
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:10,584
No, it was something
that happened back in 2006.

625
00:34:10,709 --> 00:34:13,055
There's nothing
we can do about it now.

626
00:34:21,974 --> 00:34:23,655
I think she's waking up.

627
00:34:25,332 --> 00:34:26,732
Well, hello there.

628
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:28,620
It's nice to have you back.

629
00:34:29,665 --> 00:34:31,909
You've been unconscious
for some time.

630
00:34:32,034 --> 00:34:33,956
You were in a terrible accident.

631
00:34:34,834 --> 00:34:38,425
Now, don't try to speak.
We had to wire your jaw shut.

632
00:34:39,185 --> 00:34:40,921
Now, I'm afraid...

633
00:34:41,561 --> 00:34:43,639
your internal injuries
are quite serious,

634
00:34:43,764 --> 00:34:46,537
and your facial tissue has been through
some serious trauma.

635
00:34:46,807 --> 00:34:48,704
You nearly lost all the skin
on your face,

636
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:51,208
and some of the underlying bone
was compromised as well.

637
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:54,066
But it's going to be okay.
Tell her it's going to be okay.

638
00:34:54,191 --> 00:34:55,897
A team of plastic surgeons
is flying in.

639
00:34:56,022 --> 00:34:58,427
They're going to work from
old photographs of you.

640
00:34:58,718 --> 00:35:01,281
It's going to take some time
and a number of operations,

641
00:35:01,406 --> 00:35:04,023
but the good news is,
we believe, eventually,

642
00:35:04,276 --> 00:35:06,537
you will look
just like your old self.

643
00:35:08,861 --> 00:35:11,345
We have a long road
ahead of us, Brooke.

644
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,727
You should rest.

645
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,579
Please, don't try to speak.

646
00:35:15,704 --> 00:35:17,629
Doctor,
can I have a moment with my sister?

647
00:35:17,754 --> 00:35:18,754
Of course.

648
00:35:24,383 --> 00:35:26,681
Harmony, listen to me.
They found you in Brooke's car.

649
00:35:26,806 --> 00:35:28,168
They think you're Brooke.

650
00:35:30,508 --> 00:35:32,458
You know my mom loves Brooke.

651
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:36,203
If you were Brooke,
we'd have all the money we'd ever need.

652
00:35:36,721 --> 00:35:39,933
All this... the accident,
the operations they want to do...

653
00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:43,515
it kind of feels like fate,
doesn't it?

654
00:35:48,135 --> 00:35:49,602
Sorry it's so hot in here.

655
00:35:49,727 --> 00:35:52,281
The air-conditioning has been
temperamental the last couple days.

656
00:35:52,406 --> 00:35:54,736
I think it may have finally
given out altogether.

657
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,474
- Let me know if you want more.
- Not to worry.

658
00:35:58,188 --> 00:35:59,823
So, why are we here?

659
00:36:00,365 --> 00:36:02,346
Where is Dylan?
Does he know about this?

660
00:36:02,471 --> 00:36:03,621
Actually, no.

661
00:36:04,101 --> 00:36:06,056
Given his history of involvement
with everyone,

662
00:36:06,181 --> 00:36:08,231
we wanted to talk to you first.

663
00:36:10,731 --> 00:36:12,168
We've found Harmony Fletcher.

664
00:36:14,346 --> 00:36:15,637
And what's more,

665
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:18,800
we're virtually certain that we can
prove that she's responsible,

666
00:36:18,925 --> 00:36:20,928
at least in part,
for the murder of Felicia Hoyt.

667
00:36:22,653 --> 00:36:23,853
You're joking?

668
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,174
Where was she?

669
00:36:27,108 --> 00:36:28,789
How did you ever find her?

670
00:36:29,194 --> 00:36:30,687
We didn't have to look very hard.

671
00:36:31,308 --> 00:36:33,273
We know exactly what you did,
Harmony.

672
00:36:36,674 --> 00:36:38,735
Were you...
were you just talking to me?

673
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:43,951
- That's crazy.
- We know all about the accident.

674
00:36:44,447 --> 00:36:46,539
All about
the reconstructive surgeries.

675
00:36:47,784 --> 00:36:49,623
We know who you really are, Harmony.

676
00:36:50,278 --> 00:36:51,501
You're serious?

677
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,932
It's a hell of a story.

678
00:36:55,753 --> 00:36:57,965
Lucky for us, we can prove it.

679
00:36:58,325 --> 00:36:59,514
What's he doing?

680
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:02,506
Your fingerprints are on that glass.
DNA from your lips, too.

681
00:37:03,034 --> 00:37:05,430
And I'm fairly certain
that when we test them,

682
00:37:05,555 --> 00:37:08,579
they're going to come back a perfect
match for Harmony Fletcher. Am I wrong?

683
00:37:08,704 --> 00:37:11,525
We know that Dylan killed
the real Brooke three years ago.

684
00:37:11,973 --> 00:37:14,661
They got in a fight about money.
Things got out of hand.

685
00:37:14,877 --> 00:37:17,067
The two of you conspired
to get rid of the body.

686
00:37:18,065 --> 00:37:21,765
The DNA evidence tells us
that you killed Felicia Hoyt.

687
00:37:22,877 --> 00:37:24,867
The one thing we don't know is...

688
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:26,368
why.

689
00:37:27,061 --> 00:37:29,319
And if you're willing to testify
about Dylan's complicity

690
00:37:29,444 --> 00:37:30,877
about both these murders,

691
00:37:31,002 --> 00:37:33,375
I'll just think about taking
the death penalty off the table.

692
00:37:35,762 --> 00:37:38,009
Please, feel free to exercise
your right to remain silent,

693
00:37:38,134 --> 00:37:40,867
but you should know that I'm offering
the same deal to Dylan,

694
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,879
so you'll need to decide
rather quickly

695
00:37:43,004 --> 00:37:45,525
whether or not
you believe your "brother"

696
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:48,318
will keep quiet
if his life's on the line.

697
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:55,741
I had to kill Felicia
because of her kidneys.

698
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:58,428
She need a transplant.

699
00:37:58,553 --> 00:38:01,862
She kept pressing me to get tested
to see if I was a compatible donor.

700
00:38:02,394 --> 00:38:04,036
Of course, I couldn't do that.

701
00:38:04,438 --> 00:38:07,451
The test would prove in an instant
that I wasn't really her daughter.

702
00:38:08,752 --> 00:38:11,155
She didn't understand
why I wouldn't help her.

703
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,001
How could her only
daughter just let her die?

704
00:38:15,706 --> 00:38:18,712
It got nasty between us.
She threatened to cut me off.

705
00:38:18,971 --> 00:38:21,006
And you couldn't let that happen.

706
00:38:23,399 --> 00:38:26,887
Harmony Fletcher, you're under arrest
for the murder of Felicia Hoyt.

707
00:38:27,484 --> 00:38:29,032
You have the right to remain silent,

708
00:38:29,157 --> 00:38:31,850
anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

709
00:38:38,018 --> 00:38:40,359
How goes the hunt
for a new place to live?

710
00:38:43,551 --> 00:38:45,001
That's encouraging.

711
00:38:46,051 --> 00:38:47,051
If I...

712
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:49,334
tell you something...

713
00:38:50,855 --> 00:38:52,287
promise not to roll your eyes?

714
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,956
I don't roll my eyes.

715
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:56,208
You've been rolling your eyes
my whole life.

716
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:59,169
You should have said something sooner,
'cause I have no idea that I'm doing it.

717
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:04,216
I miss my husband.

718
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:08,023
- There, you just did it again.
- Sara...

719
00:39:08,327 --> 00:39:10,255
I know.
It sounds crazy, right?

720
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,756
What are you saying? You saying
you suddenly changed your mind?

721
00:39:12,881 --> 00:39:15,027
You saying you think that he's innocent?
Because...

722
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:17,270
if you do, there's something
I got to tell you.

723
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,438
There's nothing you need to tell me.

724
00:39:19,696 --> 00:39:21,274
I know he's having an affair.

725
00:39:22,181 --> 00:39:25,046
Even have a pretty good idea
who he's having it with.

726
00:39:26,628 --> 00:39:29,866
- But I miss him, and I want to go home.
- Hold on, just wait a second.

727
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,817
I don't want to hold on a second.
That's what I want to do.

728
00:39:33,296 --> 00:39:34,538
If he'll have me.

729
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,163
If he'll have you?

730
00:39:36,288 --> 00:39:38,291
Get ready to roll those eyes again.

731
00:39:40,682 --> 00:39:42,129
I cheated on him first, Joe.

732
00:39:42,623 --> 00:39:44,923
- What?!
- I cheated on him first.

733
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,550
About a year ago.

734
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:51,422
Last summer. It was at the beach club
during the week, while Ryan was at work.

735
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,308
I never drink during the week,
and I never drink without Ryan.

736
00:39:55,661 --> 00:39:59,373
But it started to rain,
and there was nothing else to do,

737
00:40:00,102 --> 00:40:02,641
and this nice-looking guy
bought me a drink.

738
00:40:03,481 --> 00:40:05,605
Didn't even ask.
Just sent it over.

739
00:40:06,818 --> 00:40:09,656
I kind of convinced myself
it was all a big drunken nightmare.

740
00:40:11,265 --> 00:40:13,523
But then,
the guy started texting me.

741
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:17,553
I didn't answer his texts.
I didn't even encourage him.

742
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:19,914
But Ryan saw one.

743
00:40:22,978 --> 00:40:24,254
Well, say something.

744
00:40:29,741 --> 00:40:31,450
Well, anyway, I'm...

745
00:40:33,101 --> 00:40:34,201
heading home

746
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,218
tomorrow morning.

747
00:40:38,415 --> 00:40:40,507
Hopefully,
he hasn't changed the locks.

748
00:40:43,009 --> 00:40:45,331
Who knows?
Maybe a miracle will happen.

749
00:40:46,398 --> 00:40:48,675
Maybe he'll find
a reason to love me again.

750
00:40:49,946 --> 00:40:51,573
Well, for what it's worth,

751
00:40:52,384 --> 00:40:56,165
I have it on pretty good authority
that your key will still let you in.

752
00:40:56,813 --> 00:40:58,413
And believe it or not,

753
00:40:58,834 --> 00:41:00,584
being married to Allison,

754
00:41:01,181 --> 00:41:04,086
I'm learning to buy into
this miracle thing more and more.

755
00:41:05,509 --> 00:41:08,119
It's quite a family
you've married into, huh?

756
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,199
Dad's a liar, sister's a cheater.

757
00:41:11,835 --> 00:41:15,817
I'm starting to think maybe my mom
kills drifters in her spare time.

758
00:41:17,827 --> 00:41:20,259
Well, at least she's home again,

759
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,390
and there's peace for now.

760
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,226
Honey, your room's ready!

761
00:41:25,498 --> 00:41:27,931
Hey, you know what?
I get to be an uncle.

762
00:41:28,324 --> 00:41:31,274
I mean, if everything
that my dad says is right,

763
00:41:31,587 --> 00:41:34,054
- I'm going to be an uncle.
- Congratulations, Unc!

764
00:41:34,179 --> 00:41:35,179
Thank you.

765
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:37,737
Ariel, you can have your room back!

766
00:41:38,332 --> 00:41:40,692
- I guess I'll be an aunt.
- That's right.

767
00:41:40,817 --> 00:41:42,207
What's all the hollering about?

768
00:41:42,555 --> 00:41:45,699
Honey, can you go tell your sister
in the kitchen that her room's ready?

769
00:41:45,824 --> 00:41:47,332
What are you talking about?

770
00:41:47,457 --> 00:41:48,877
Ariel isn't in the kitchen.

771
00:41:49,276 --> 00:41:51,182
She's not even home from school yet.

772
00:41:52,011 --> 00:41:54,097
What are you talking about?
It's after 5:00.

773
00:41:55,315 --> 00:41:56,972
But she's still not home
from school.

774
00:41:57,302 --> 00:42:01,002
You know, it's Friday. I bet she left
school and went on that ski trip.

775
00:42:02,346 --> 00:42:04,544
I have Ashley's
number in the kitchen.
