1
00:00:02,171 --> 00:00:04,182
                              

2
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:34,188
                              

3
00:00:57,423 --> 00:00:59,400
         (Joe coughing)         

4
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,953
             Hey. You all right?

5
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,669
Need something cold.            

6
00:01:05,704 --> 00:01:07,212
            Hey, how's that flu?

7
00:01:07,247 --> 00:01:09,324
 That cough doesn't sound good. 

8
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:10,899
     I don't know why not.      

9
00:01:10,968 --> 00:01:13,615
    I've been practicing it     
        all night.              

10
00:01:13,684 --> 00:01:17,673

11
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,580
 "You Give Me Fever"        

11
00:01:59,648 --> 00:02:00,988
                 No, no, no, no,
                I understand.   

12
00:02:01,022 --> 00:02:02,966
                 I don't live in
             your area, but I...

13
00:02:03,034 --> 00:02:05,312
     I've called all the clinics
        around us, and, well,   

14
00:02:05,347 --> 00:02:08,095
         they all seem to be out
             of the flu vaccine.

15
00:02:08,164 --> 00:02:09,638
             N-no, I understand.

16
00:02:09,673 --> 00:02:11,414
                  The very young
            and the very old.   

17
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:12,856
                The thing is, my
                 husband's sick,

18
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:14,633
                 and I'm worried
             that if I get sick,

19
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:15,975
            there's not going   
                    to be anyone

20
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:17,952
                 to take care of
                 our three kids.

21
00:02:21,105 --> 00:02:22,813
            You can?            
        (chuckles)              

22
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:24,188
        You will?               

23
00:02:24,222 --> 00:02:25,529
              Oh.               

24
00:02:25,597 --> 00:02:27,541
             11:45.             

25
00:02:27,575 --> 00:02:31,866
    Um, is there any way you    
could do that any earlier?      

26
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,883
    It's just that Chandler     
  is so far from where I work.  

27
00:02:35,924 --> 00:02:36,962
You know what, never mind.      

28
00:02:36,996 --> 00:02:38,001
          Never mind.           

29
00:02:38,036 --> 00:02:39,375
    11:45. I will be there.     

30
00:02:39,444 --> 00:02:41,120
Don't give anyone my shot.      

31
00:02:41,187 --> 00:02:43,198
            Thanks.             

32
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:44,640
Boy, you sure seem happy        

33
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:46,483
for someone that's going        
to get a shot.                  

34
00:02:46,518 --> 00:02:47,590
          Yeah, I am.           

35
00:02:47,658 --> 00:02:49,199
    You guys are lucky          
    you got yours at school,    

36
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:51,244
but I missed mine at work,      
 and with Daddy sick and all... 

37
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:53,223
      Mom, do you want me       
      to take that to Dad       

38
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,669
            so that you can, uh,
            have some breakfast?

39
00:02:55,738 --> 00:02:56,775
        Would you?              

40
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:57,950
                        Yeah.   

41
00:02:57,984 --> 00:02:59,056
            Thanks.             

42
00:02:59,124 --> 00:03:00,397
BRIDGETTE:                      
Hey, Mom?                       

43
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:02,945
      How's that detective      
      you work with doing?      

44
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,354
              Detective Scanlon?

45
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:05,594
              He's good.        

46
00:03:05,628 --> 00:03:07,337
         He's got a beautiful   
          little baby girl.     

47
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:08,377
                  Yeah.         

48
00:03:08,444 --> 00:03:09,348
          He's good. Definitely.

49
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,623
             Why do you ask?    

50
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,534
I just had this dream last night

51
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:15,014
  that didn't make much sense.  

52
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,362
             What kind of dream?

53
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,534
     It was nothing really.     

54
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:20,781
  I mean, he was just sitting   
        in a restaurant         

55
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:24,234
 with this pretty blonde lady,  
     and he was really sad.     

56
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:25,240
He had                          
this little box,                

57
00:03:25,274 --> 00:03:27,018
and I think there               
was a ring in it.               

58
00:03:27,052 --> 00:03:30,136
     But the big thing is,      
    he was just really sad.     

59
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,816
But, uh, that doesn't           
make sense, right?              

60
00:03:32,852 --> 00:03:34,762
     I mean, if he already      
          has a baby,           

61
00:03:34,796 --> 00:03:37,007
     then why was he giving     
    this lady a ring?           

62
00:03:37,043 --> 00:03:39,824
 And what would have to happen  
      to make him so sad?       

63
00:03:39,858 --> 00:03:41,501
      I don't know, honey.      

64
00:03:41,535 --> 00:03:43,445
         Those are all          
     really good questions.     

65
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,764
  Hmm. So, you don't think it   
 makes much sense, either, huh? 

66
00:03:48,241 --> 00:03:50,016
             Cool.              

67
00:03:51,258 --> 00:03:52,799
     (elevator bell dings)      

68
00:03:55,951 --> 00:03:57,560
        (coughing)              

69
00:04:02,456 --> 00:04:05,170
     (sniffing)                 

70
00:04:05,205 --> 00:04:07,115
         (man coughing)         

71
00:04:18,113 --> 00:04:20,928
SCANLON:                        
So, what do you think?          

72
00:04:20,962 --> 00:04:23,040
Good ring, nice ring?           

73
00:04:23,107 --> 00:04:24,717
             It's very good.    

74
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:27,096
              It's very nice.   

75
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:28,538
You think Lynn will like it?    

76
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:31,321
Well, of course, she'll like it.

77
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,662
         Who wouldn't?          

78
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,735
        (chuckles)              

79
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,009
 I was thinking maybe tonight.  

80
00:04:35,043 --> 00:04:36,283
    Figure it's time.           

81
00:04:36,351 --> 00:04:37,590
I wait much longer,             
little Leigh                    

82
00:04:37,626 --> 00:04:39,870
will be old enough              
to be the maid of honor.        
                (chuckles)      

83
00:04:41,313 --> 00:04:43,424
        Boy, there's a lot of   
    strangers around here today.

84
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:45,402
                What's going on?

85
00:04:45,437 --> 00:04:47,716
            SCANLON:            
 It's a big hush-hush briefing  
    with some guy from FEMA.    

86
00:04:47,784 --> 00:04:49,761
    You're not going?           
                      Not going.

87
00:04:49,863 --> 00:04:51,605
         Wasn't asked.          
    Damn glad about it, too.    

88
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,952
I have somewhere to be at 11:45.

89
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:03,172
              MAN:              
This picture was taken in 1996. 

90
00:05:03,206 --> 00:05:05,249
    The subject lived           
    in a small village          

91
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:08,234
in the Democratic Republic      
         of the Congo.          

92
00:05:08,268 --> 00:05:11,990
He succumbed to a disease       
called viral hemorrhagic fever. 

93
00:05:12,057 --> 00:05:14,402
        It's very rare.         

94
00:05:14,437 --> 00:05:18,292
The strain responsible for this 
  man's death is called FV-39.  

95
00:05:18,326 --> 00:05:20,036
     Ladies and gentlemen,      

96
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,087
          FV-39 is of           
    particular concern to us    

97
00:05:23,121 --> 00:05:27,077
because the virus holds up well 
in transport and weaponization. 

98
00:05:27,144 --> 00:05:29,054
 In fact, there are a few of us 

99
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:31,938
      who believe that it       
    would be an ideal agent     

100
00:05:31,972 --> 00:05:34,452
for a bioterrorist attack       
against the United States.      

101
00:05:34,486 --> 00:05:36,129
          (man coughs)          

102
00:05:36,163 --> 00:05:38,174
      FEMA has been trying      
    to create an antiserum,     

103
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,950
  a cure that can be deployed   

104
00:05:39,985 --> 00:05:42,967
in the event of just such       
     a bioterrorist attack.     

105
00:05:43,036 --> 00:05:44,643
  In fact, we've been working   
          very closely          

106
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,287
with a company right here       
        in Phoenix              

107
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:48,936
    that is at the forefront    
        of that effort.         

108
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,550
Dr. Erik Westphal heads up      

109
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:54,836
the bio-pathology division      
of United Southfield.           

110
00:05:54,904 --> 00:05:56,545
I'll let him take it            
from here.                      

111
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,954
    Doctor.                     

112
00:05:57,989 --> 00:05:59,630
     Um... (clears throat)      

113
00:05:59,664 --> 00:06:03,050
     Our lab is a biosafety     
        level four lab.         

114
00:06:03,084 --> 00:06:04,525
 That means we're handling some 

115
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:06,738
of the deadliest microbes       
         on the planet.         

116
00:06:06,772 --> 00:06:09,755
Uh, naturally, both our company 
and the federal government      

117
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:12,806
  spend extraordinary amounts   
    of time and money           

118
00:06:12,841 --> 00:06:15,153
monitoring our inventory.       

119
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:19,914
 When the government inspectors 
      gathered their data       

120
00:06:19,948 --> 00:06:21,456
and filed their latest reports, 

121
00:06:21,558 --> 00:06:23,300
         there appeared         
      to be trace amounts       

122
00:06:23,335 --> 00:06:26,519
of FV-39 cultures missing       
from some of our samples.       

123
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,591
          (murmuring)           

124
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,134
This isn't                      
the kind of thing               

125
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:31,448
     that you would notice      
     on a day-to-day basis,     

126
00:06:31,515 --> 00:06:34,096
        but over time...        

127
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:37,281
  There is a measurable amount  
          of this bug           

128
00:06:37,316 --> 00:06:39,694
         that we simply         
    can't account for.          

129
00:06:39,762 --> 00:06:41,069
          (murmuring)           

130
00:06:41,104 --> 00:06:43,383
MAN:                            
Worst case scenario,            
ladies and gentlemen,           

131
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:45,930
  is that someone either sold   
     or gave these cultures     

132
00:06:45,965 --> 00:06:47,808
        to someone              
    who intends to use them     

133
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:49,887
          as a weapon           
      of mass destruction.      

134
00:06:49,954 --> 00:06:52,099
        We at FEMA              
      need to move forward      

135
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:53,742
 as though that were the case.  

136
00:06:53,776 --> 00:06:55,184
DINOVI:                         
So, what does this mean?        

137
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:57,263
            Is Homeland Security
     issuing some kind of alert?

138
00:06:57,297 --> 00:06:58,804
              MAN:              
      Quite the contrary.       

139
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,783
    There will be no alert.     

140
00:07:00,817 --> 00:07:02,761
 There will be no notification. 

141
00:07:02,795 --> 00:07:04,672
        There will be no        
      public announcement       

142
00:07:04,741 --> 00:07:05,979
of any kind.                    

143
00:07:06,047 --> 00:07:07,421
As a matter of fact,            

144
00:07:07,456 --> 00:07:09,533
        the only people         
  who know anything about this  

145
00:07:09,568 --> 00:07:11,411
          are sitting           
    in this room right now,     

146
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:14,730
      and that is the way       
    it's got to stay.           

147
00:07:14,764 --> 00:07:18,586
  Dr. Westphal doesn't happen   
  to agree with that decision,  

148
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,999
but the fact is, at this moment,
     ladies and gentlemen,      

149
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:23,380
         we do not have         
     an effective antiserum     

150
00:07:23,415 --> 00:07:25,626
    in sufficient quantities    
    to deal with this.          

151
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,806
          As a result,          
    the preventive measures     

152
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,850
 that we can take are limited.  

153
00:07:29,886 --> 00:07:32,700
Dr. Westphal,                   
if this virus--                 

154
00:07:32,735 --> 00:07:35,617
this FV-39--                    
is out there,                   

155
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:37,260
how bad could it get?           

156
00:07:37,328 --> 00:07:39,137
How many people                 
would be affected?              

157
00:07:40,143 --> 00:07:41,249
            It's hard to say.   

158
00:07:41,284 --> 00:07:42,893
                     It's not an
                 airborne virus.

159
00:07:42,927 --> 00:07:45,105
                 It is spread by
              people, to people,

160
00:07:45,172 --> 00:07:48,692
      and it carries a mortality
              rate of about 85%,

161
00:07:48,727 --> 00:07:50,906
which is what makes it          
such an effective threat.       

162
00:07:50,973 --> 00:07:53,655
Again, depending                
on how long it was out there    

163
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:57,678
and how soon we were able       
        to contain it...        

164
00:07:57,712 --> 00:07:59,756
    hundreds of dead?           

165
00:07:59,824 --> 00:08:02,572
    Thousands, maybe.           

166
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:05,858
    It's just too hard          
        to say for sure.        

167
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,573
              JOE:              
    You did the right thing.    

168
00:08:08,642 --> 00:08:09,949
        (coughing)              

169
00:08:10,017 --> 00:08:11,591
  There's nothing to be gained  

170
00:08:11,626 --> 00:08:14,273
        by telling a man        
 who's contemplating proposing  

171
00:08:14,307 --> 00:08:17,760
      that it might not--       
 and I underline "might not"--  

172
00:08:17,795 --> 00:08:20,074
  go exactly the way he hopes.  

173
00:08:20,141 --> 00:08:21,213
         Yeah, I know.          

174
00:08:21,248 --> 00:08:22,654
         But you should         
      have seen his face.       

175
00:08:22,724 --> 00:08:23,829
    He looked so vulnerable.    

176
00:08:23,863 --> 00:08:25,773
I just... I hate the idea       

177
00:08:25,807 --> 00:08:27,650
         of him getting         
    his feelings hurt.          

178
00:08:27,684 --> 00:08:29,393
  Well, if Bridgette's right,   

179
00:08:29,428 --> 00:08:31,405
    he's going to get           
    his feelings hurt           

180
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:32,881
    no matter what you do--     

181
00:08:32,915 --> 00:08:36,065
    um, either by you or...     
     or at dinner tonight.      

182
00:08:36,168 --> 00:08:37,473
              Huh.              

183
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,714
         Well, thanks.          

184
00:08:38,748 --> 00:08:40,658
  That... that... that helps.   

185
00:08:40,693 --> 00:08:42,100
That feels better. Thanks.      

186
00:08:42,203 --> 00:08:43,207
         Anything else?         

187
00:08:43,242 --> 00:08:45,687
         Oh, uh, honey,         
     can you do me a favor?     

188
00:08:45,722 --> 00:08:47,833
        I'm running late        
        for my flu shot,        

189
00:08:47,869 --> 00:08:49,509
     and I left the number      
         of the clinic          

190
00:08:49,544 --> 00:08:50,784
 in the kitchen on the counter. 

191
00:08:50,818 --> 00:08:52,192
    Can you go read it to me    

192
00:08:52,226 --> 00:08:54,304
     so I can let them know     
     that I'm still coming?     

193
00:08:54,338 --> 00:08:56,517
    You want me to go           
all the way back to the kitchen?

194
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:58,059
         Honey, please.         
    (tires screeching)          

195
00:08:58,093 --> 00:09:00,674
    I don't want them           
to give away my flu shot.       

196
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:12,575
        You still there?        

197
00:09:12,611 --> 00:09:14,185
     I think there's going      
    to be an accident.          

198
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:15,291
             What?              

199
00:09:15,327 --> 00:09:16,331
Honey, hang up the phone.       

200
00:09:16,366 --> 00:09:17,471
        Call 911.               

201
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:18,879
 Tell them to send an ambulance 

202
00:09:18,914 --> 00:09:21,125
to North Beeline Highway,       
 just south of Shea Boulevard.  

203
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,600
Tell them to send a fire truck. 

204
00:09:22,634 --> 00:09:24,076
         There's a man          
     who's about to crash,      

205
00:09:24,111 --> 00:09:26,355
    and he's got a backseat     
    full of gasoline.           

206
00:09:43,857 --> 00:09:44,929
          Sir!                  

207
00:09:44,997 --> 00:09:46,773
                Sir! Wake up!   

208
00:09:46,808 --> 00:09:48,450
            (coughs)            

209
00:09:48,484 --> 00:09:50,159
          Sir, sir, wake up!    

210
00:09:50,194 --> 00:09:51,668
What are you doing?             

211
00:09:51,703 --> 00:09:53,512
         Get out of the car now.

212
00:09:55,926 --> 00:09:57,737
      Your car's on fire.       
    You have to get out now.    

213
00:09:57,771 --> 00:09:59,211
     No. Get away!              

214
00:09:59,246 --> 00:10:00,720
    Get away from me!           

215
00:10:00,755 --> 00:10:01,960
         Open the door!         

216
00:10:01,995 --> 00:10:04,006
    Go away! Get away!          

217
00:10:04,073 --> 00:10:05,548
    You have to get out now.    

218
00:10:05,617 --> 00:10:07,090
  Your car's going to explode.  

219
00:10:07,192 --> 00:10:08,332
        Get away!               
                             No.

220
00:10:08,366 --> 00:10:10,409
I want to die, damn it!         

221
00:10:10,445 --> 00:10:11,415
        Go!                     

222
00:10:11,484 --> 00:10:12,455
                      It's going
                     to explode!

223
00:10:12,522 --> 00:10:15,405
Go! Go!                         

224
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:25,529
          (explosion)           

225
00:10:25,563 --> 00:10:26,635
            I just don't get it.

226
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:27,976
                    I mean, what
                    is the point

227
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:29,552
            of dreaming about   
    something like this if...   

228
00:10:29,586 --> 00:10:31,161
            if you can't stop   
              it from happening?

229
00:10:31,196 --> 00:10:33,274
Well, I wish I had              
an answer for you.              

230
00:10:33,308 --> 00:10:35,352
I'm just glad he                
didn't take you with him.       

231
00:10:35,387 --> 00:10:37,330
Did, uh... did he               
say anything to you             

232
00:10:37,398 --> 00:10:38,872
before the car                  
blew up?                        

233
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:40,381
         No, he just kept saying

234
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,063
          that he wasn't getting
                 out of the car.

235
00:10:43,098 --> 00:10:46,683
        He kept telling me to   
          go away over and over.

236
00:10:47,724 --> 00:10:50,607
Look, uh, the driver            
was determined to do            

237
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:52,619
what he was determined to do.   

238
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,998
He turned his car into a bomb.  

239
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:57,781
Even if you had managed         
to get him out of it,           

240
00:10:57,849 --> 00:10:59,659
don't you think that ultimately 
he would have found             

241
00:10:59,694 --> 00:11:01,235
some other way                  
to get the job done?            

242
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:03,950
            (sighs)             

243
00:11:03,984 --> 00:11:06,565
            Oh, God.            

244
00:11:11,997 --> 00:11:15,114
            (sighs)             

245
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,782
            (gasps)             

246
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,961
You okay?                       

247
00:11:31,477 --> 00:11:34,191
                 Yeah.          

248
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:37,242
    Yeah, fine, I guess, I...   

249
00:11:37,277 --> 00:11:38,449
            What time is it?    

250
00:11:38,484 --> 00:11:40,159
    It's 1:45.                  

251
00:11:40,193 --> 00:11:41,164
          Why?                  

252
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:42,203
                Damn it.        

253
00:11:42,272 --> 00:11:43,646
Is there anything               
I can help you with?            

254
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,959
            I had an appointment
        to go get a flu shot,   

255
00:11:45,993 --> 00:11:48,105
      which is why I'm out here.

256
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:50,418
    That was over two hours ago.

257
00:11:50,487 --> 00:11:52,060
              You know what?    
                It's fine.      

258
00:11:52,096 --> 00:11:55,515
    I'm just going to call them,
          I'm gonna apologize...

259
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:56,687
                 (sighs)        

260
00:11:56,723 --> 00:11:59,538
                Suddenly I'm not
         feeling so good anyway.

261
00:11:59,572 --> 00:12:01,550
            I think I might have
    already caught Joe's bug.   

262
00:12:01,584 --> 00:12:03,829
Well, do me a favor             
and don't sneeze on me, okay?   

263
00:12:03,897 --> 00:12:06,176
I have big plans                
tonight, remember?              

264
00:12:06,243 --> 00:12:09,193
           For she's           
     a jolly good fellow       

265
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,809
     For she's a jolly good    
            fellow             

266
00:12:11,876 --> 00:12:14,859
           For she's           
     a jolly good fellow       

267
00:12:14,961 --> 00:12:17,508
 Which nobody can deny.       

268
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:19,855
        (cheering)              

269
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:21,329
Hey, sorry I'm late.            

270
00:12:21,364 --> 00:12:22,838
(sighing)                       

271
00:12:26,527 --> 00:12:28,470
          You okay?             

272
00:12:28,538 --> 00:12:30,985
                Look at them.   

273
00:12:31,053 --> 00:12:33,836
They have no idea.              

274
00:12:36,585 --> 00:12:38,730
                I can't help it.

275
00:12:38,765 --> 00:12:39,803
          I can't help wondering

276
00:12:39,837 --> 00:12:42,653
            how many of them are
             going to survive...

277
00:12:42,687 --> 00:12:44,095
                 if you're going
                to survive...   

278
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:46,944
              if little Leigh is
            going to survive.   

279
00:12:46,978 --> 00:12:48,688
No, you can't talk              
that way.                       

280
00:12:48,722 --> 00:12:51,470
You can't think that way.       

281
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,615
     We'll figure this out,     
         we always do.          

282
00:12:53,683 --> 00:12:55,024
                      Really?   

283
00:12:55,059 --> 00:12:56,265
              Are we any further
                along tonight   

284
00:12:56,299 --> 00:12:57,941
                    than we were
                this morning?   

285
00:12:57,976 --> 00:13:00,255
         Do we know anything now
    that we didn't know then?   

286
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:02,835
            How do you do it?   

287
00:13:02,904 --> 00:13:04,713
            How do you stop a   
            thing you can't see?

288
00:13:04,781 --> 00:13:05,987
    (distant laughter)          

289
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,352
                  I think I just
                want to go home.

290
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,564
             I think I just want
             to be with my baby.

291
00:13:18,494 --> 00:13:20,471
         Oh, I'm sorry.         

292
00:13:20,505 --> 00:13:21,812
        What am I doing?        

293
00:13:21,846 --> 00:13:23,555
 We didn't come here for this.  

294
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:26,137
Uh, you said there was something
you wanted to talk to me about, 

295
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:27,712
                    something   
                      important.

296
00:13:27,747 --> 00:13:31,435
You know what? It'll keep.      

297
00:13:31,469 --> 00:13:33,982
    Let's just go home          
     and be with our baby.      

298
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,904
            ALLISON:            
          I don't know.         

299
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:42,632
I saw this horrible thing       
    and then I just--           

300
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,040
    I got the shakes.           
        (beeping)               

301
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:48,063
 And then I felt kind of dizzy, 
    felt kind of achy.          

302
00:13:48,097 --> 00:13:51,047
                        99.6.   

303
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:53,360
Huh?                            

304
00:13:53,395 --> 00:13:54,936
              You are one degree
                above normal.   

305
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,652
(sighing):                      
I feel like I'm dying.          

306
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,065
                    Well, I'm   
                 sorry, Allison.

307
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,177
            I don't want to make
              a liar out of you,

308
00:14:02,247 --> 00:14:06,470
        but people do not die   
         from one-degree fevers.

309
00:14:06,504 --> 00:14:08,682
            I know that's not   
          what you want to hear,

310
00:14:08,716 --> 00:14:12,370
        and it's no fun being   
         the bearer of bad news,

311
00:14:12,471 --> 00:14:14,381
            but I think you have
            what everyone has   

312
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:18,069
              and I think you're
                  going to live.

313
00:14:18,103 --> 00:14:19,276
                     Now...     

314
00:14:19,345 --> 00:14:23,534
                    (coughs)    

315
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:26,048
                    Want to hear
                 some good news?

316
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,765
            Now that we are both
              sick with the flu,

317
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:31,547
        I believe we can once   
    again share the same bed.   

318
00:14:31,582 --> 00:14:34,632
Wait a second,                  
what's the good news?           

319
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,443
     (chuckles)                 

320
00:14:36,477 --> 00:14:39,392
        Ariel can take the girls
             to school tomorrow,

321
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,835
         and maybe I'll actually
                feel good enough

322
00:14:40,869 --> 00:14:42,879
             to go back to work.

323
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,081
            (sighs)             

324
00:14:49,116 --> 00:14:54,044
    Try to get this morning     
        out of my mind.         

325
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,100
The smell of all that gasoline, 

326
00:14:58,134 --> 00:15:00,783
 the smell of that man burning. 

327
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:05,845
     (engine accelerating)      

328
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,200
            (coughs)            

329
00:15:28,979 --> 00:15:31,125
            (gasps)             

330
00:15:31,192 --> 00:15:32,365
             Lee...             

331
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,604
hi, sorry to call so late.      

332
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,851
 I-I know you had a big evening 
        and all, but...         

333
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:38,131
    SCANLON (quietly):          
Oh, no, no, that's okay, I, uh, 

334
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:41,550
    I kind of called a flag     
          on the play.          

335
00:15:41,585 --> 00:15:44,568
  Right idea, uh, wrong night.  

336
00:15:44,602 --> 00:15:46,077
            Really?             

337
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,384
        What's up?              

338
00:15:47,418 --> 00:15:49,899
         I don't know,          
 I-I just had the oddest dream  

339
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:53,050
about that man who burned       
himself alive today in that car.

340
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:55,665
I think he was sick, Lee,       
          really sick.          

341
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:56,973
    What do you mean?           

342
00:15:57,008 --> 00:15:59,655
         I don't know,          
 I just had a dream, and in it  

343
00:15:59,723 --> 00:16:00,963
        he was coughing,        

344
00:16:00,997 --> 00:16:05,455
he had these white, oozy things 
      on his face, and...       

345
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:09,881
    he was bleeding a little    
 around his eyes and his nose.  

346
00:16:09,915 --> 00:16:11,088
            Oh, no.             

347
00:16:11,122 --> 00:16:15,077
  What do you mean, "Oh, no"?   

348
00:16:15,112 --> 00:16:16,720
            What people have you
            been in contact with

349
00:16:16,754 --> 00:16:18,263
 since you were at the accident?

350
00:16:18,297 --> 00:16:19,871
    What do you mean,           
    "in contact with"?          

351
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,944
     Allison, think, what people

352
00:16:20,978 --> 00:16:22,253
            have you been around
             since the accident?

353
00:16:22,287 --> 00:16:23,727
              You,              

354
00:16:23,795 --> 00:16:27,918
 all the police and the medical 
people who showed up, my family.

355
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:30,198
              Why?              

356
00:16:30,233 --> 00:16:31,941
        Lee, talk to me.        

357
00:16:31,976 --> 00:16:33,182
        What's going on?        

358
00:16:33,217 --> 00:16:35,897
         We may have a problem--

359
00:16:35,965 --> 00:16:40,725
                  you, me...    

360
00:16:40,793 --> 00:16:42,234
                  all of us.    

361
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,346
        Stay put,               
 I'm gonna call you right back. 

362
00:16:44,381 --> 00:16:46,358
W-What do you mean, "Stay put"? 

363
00:16:46,426 --> 00:16:48,202
        What's going on?        

364
00:16:48,237 --> 00:16:51,220
          Lee... Lee.           

365
00:16:51,287 --> 00:16:55,175
        It seems weird,         
 eating while it's still dark.  

366
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,718
    I know, I'm sorry, guys.    

367
00:16:56,752 --> 00:16:58,126
                 So are we going
                 to school today

368
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,198
                    or what?    

369
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:00,338
I don't know,                   

370
00:17:00,407 --> 00:17:02,786
      honey, I don't know       
        what's going on.        

371
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,630
    They just told us           
      to wake everybody up      

372
00:17:04,665 --> 00:17:07,379
         and make sure          
that we don't go outside.       

373
00:17:07,414 --> 00:17:10,464
         We can't open          
     any windows or doors.      

374
00:17:10,498 --> 00:17:11,904
        They were going         
    to come over soon           

375
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,386
 and explain everything to us.  

376
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,263
JOE:                            
There are trucks outside.       

377
00:17:16,332 --> 00:17:17,537
They don't have                 
their lights on,                

378
00:17:17,573 --> 00:17:19,851
      but I can hear them,      

379
00:17:19,952 --> 00:17:23,036
 and people are doing something 
    on the front lawn.          

380
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,780
        You sure I can't        
      just open the door?       

381
00:17:24,814 --> 00:17:28,635
 No, Devalos was very specific. 

382
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:30,344
                          ARIEL:
        There's a man outside   
              my bedroom window.

383
00:17:30,379 --> 00:17:32,993
He's putting up plastic         
or something.                   

384
00:17:33,027 --> 00:17:36,481
         (phone rings)          

385
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:37,821
                 Hello.         

386
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:39,665
              MAN:              
          May I speak           
  with Allison Dubois, please?  

387
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,341
            This is her husband.
                 Can I help you?

388
00:17:41,409 --> 00:17:43,118
    Is everyone awake?          

389
00:17:43,153 --> 00:17:45,398
 We don't want to unnecessarily 
        frighten anyone.        

390
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:46,539
    What do you mean,           
      "Is everyone awake?"      

391
00:17:46,573 --> 00:17:48,080
    Who am I speaking with?     

392
00:17:48,114 --> 00:17:49,823
This is Dr. Erik Westphal.      

393
00:17:49,892 --> 00:17:51,097
I'm with United Southfield      
         Laboratories.          

394
00:17:51,132 --> 00:17:52,337
 I'm here with the FEMA people. 

395
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:53,377
    Is everyone awake?          

396
00:17:53,412 --> 00:17:54,719
     Are you ready for us?      

397
00:17:54,753 --> 00:17:57,669
We'd love to get this over with 
    before the sun comes up     

398
00:17:57,704 --> 00:17:59,815
and your neighbors notice       
    what we're up to.           
What is he saying?              

399
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:01,055
      Well, wait a second.      

400
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:02,563
      What are you up to?       

401
00:18:02,632 --> 00:18:04,810
Just open the front door,       
          Mr. Dubois.           

402
00:18:04,878 --> 00:18:06,018
      We're right outside.      

403
00:18:07,058 --> 00:18:09,403
                  They're at the
                     front door.

404
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:15,070
    (knocking on door)          

405
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:18,287
                    WESTPHAL:   
                Mr. Dubois, this
                is Dr. Westphal.

406
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:24,860
  Mr. Dubois... are you there?  

407
00:18:24,894 --> 00:18:26,837
                  Could you open
            the door, please?   

408
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:27,843
                      We're, uh,

409
00:18:27,911 --> 00:18:29,318
                  kind of racing
                      the clock.

410
00:18:33,711 --> 00:18:35,654
             Mrs. Dubois has had
                 direct contact.

411
00:18:35,722 --> 00:18:37,565
             I need her isolated
        in a room by herself.   

412
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:39,074
                  The father and
                    the children

413
00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:41,153
                 can be examined
             together somewhere.

414
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:42,226
Wait a minute.                  

415
00:18:42,261 --> 00:18:43,366
             Mrs. Dubois, I need
                 to examine you.

416
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,774
                  I need samples

417
00:18:44,808 --> 00:18:47,623
     of your blood, your saliva,
      your hair, and your urine.

418
00:18:47,657 --> 00:18:48,629
  What are you talking about?   

419
00:18:48,663 --> 00:18:49,635
     What is going on here?     

420
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:51,144
 Why do you need to examine me? 

421
00:18:51,178 --> 00:18:53,424
Why do you need to examine      
  my husband and my children?   

422
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:54,966
            I promise you I will
    explain everything to you   

423
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,972
                 at the earliest
                    opportunity,

424
00:18:56,006 --> 00:18:57,882
        but right now I need you

425
00:18:57,951 --> 00:19:00,028
        to show my colleagues   
         back into your bedroom.

426
00:19:00,064 --> 00:19:02,308
      Every moment we lose could
          potentially compromise

427
00:19:02,377 --> 00:19:04,689
            your health and your
                family's health.

428
00:19:28,427 --> 00:19:30,839
                      (clanging)

429
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,841
(rustling)                      

430
00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:45,422
(door opens)                    

431
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:49,680
Mrs. Dubois,                    

432
00:19:49,714 --> 00:19:51,557
    I'm, uh, I'm sorry          
    this has taken so long.     

433
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:53,536
              Where's my family?
                     I can't get

434
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,608
      a hold of my family.      

435
00:19:54,643 --> 00:19:56,218
      I keep texting them,      
         calling them.          

436
00:19:56,253 --> 00:19:58,665
    They don't answer,          
     they don't write back.     

437
00:19:58,699 --> 00:19:59,939
Well, your husband is           

438
00:19:59,974 --> 00:20:02,253
      in the living room,       
getting an IV drip for his flu. 

439
00:20:02,287 --> 00:20:03,393
        (clears throat)         

440
00:20:03,427 --> 00:20:05,471
  Your kids were totally fine,  

441
00:20:05,506 --> 00:20:08,153
and your eldest daughter        
took them to school.            

442
00:20:08,188 --> 00:20:12,143
    As for you, do you sleep    
      on a feather pillow?      

443
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,020
    Well... What? Why?          

444
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:15,093
         You shouldn't.         

445
00:20:15,128 --> 00:20:16,702
        You're allergic.        

446
00:20:16,736 --> 00:20:18,546
 Other than that, you're fine.  

447
00:20:18,647 --> 00:20:19,787
        Are you serious?        

448
00:20:19,821 --> 00:20:21,631
    You show up at my house     
     looking like something     

449
00:20:21,665 --> 00:20:24,581
out of a science fiction movie, 
 and you tell me that I'm fine, 

450
00:20:24,616 --> 00:20:26,760
     that everyone's fine,      
    that everything is fine?    

451
00:20:26,794 --> 00:20:28,671
Yeah, I am sorry,               
but we had no choice.           

452
00:20:28,705 --> 00:20:30,817
Okay, the man that you saw      
kill himself yesterday          

453
00:20:30,852 --> 00:20:32,930
was a biologist                 
who worked in my lab.           

454
00:20:32,964 --> 00:20:35,846
  His name was Mitchell Lomis   
 and he was apparently infected 

455
00:20:35,914 --> 00:20:40,037
  with a very, very dangerous   
      virus called FV-39.       

456
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:44,027
    You thought that I caught   
     this virus, whatever it is?

457
00:20:44,061 --> 00:20:46,909
  Yeah, you and all the other   
people who rushed to help Mitch.

458
00:20:46,978 --> 00:20:48,754
This virus...                   

459
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:54,923
  There are organizations, uh,  
        movements               

460
00:20:54,957 --> 00:20:59,147
    that would pay a fortune    
for even a minute amount of it. 

461
00:20:59,182 --> 00:21:01,762
    Y-You infect one person     
      and then expose him       

462
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,942
 to as many people as possible  
    before he succumbs          

463
00:21:03,976 --> 00:21:06,187
      and you can decimate      
         a small city.          

464
00:21:06,257 --> 00:21:08,803
At our lab we were working      
on this virus,                  

465
00:21:08,837 --> 00:21:10,714
    working on a cure.          

466
00:21:10,782 --> 00:21:13,430
How Mitch became infected,      
      we still don't know,      

467
00:21:13,464 --> 00:21:15,743
      but I can't believe       
    that it was an accident.    

468
00:21:15,778 --> 00:21:17,554
         There are just         
      too many safeguards,      

469
00:21:17,588 --> 00:21:20,403
 too many checks and balances.  

470
00:21:20,438 --> 00:21:21,745
          The fear is           

471
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:24,225
     that he was attempting     
to steal some and sell it.      

472
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,203
                 How well do you
            know this person?   

473
00:21:26,238 --> 00:21:28,282
          Uh, does he strike you
        as the kind of person   

474
00:21:28,316 --> 00:21:30,326
                    who could do
            something like that?

475
00:21:30,362 --> 00:21:33,344
  There's a time when I would   
have said absolutely not.       

476
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:35,355
      But he went through       
     a pretty ugly divorce      

477
00:21:35,425 --> 00:21:37,032
     a couple of years ago.     

478
00:21:37,067 --> 00:21:40,217
He had some financial struggles,
      emotional struggles.      

479
00:21:40,252 --> 00:21:43,234
Just wrestling with depression. 

480
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,917
      I-I just keep hoping      

481
00:21:45,952 --> 00:21:47,928
    that whatever he took...    

482
00:21:47,964 --> 00:21:50,511
    it was incinerated          
    right when he was.          

483
00:21:50,578 --> 00:21:51,751
     But what if it wasn't?     

484
00:21:51,785 --> 00:21:52,957
 What if it's still out there?  

485
00:21:53,026 --> 00:21:56,009
         Yeah, well...          

486
00:21:56,043 --> 00:21:58,658
      let's just pray that      
      that's not the case.      

487
00:22:00,703 --> 00:22:02,848
Uh, it's not that we            

488
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:04,859
    don't have an antivirus,    
          by the way.           

489
00:22:04,928 --> 00:22:06,201
  It's just that we don't have  
         enough funding         

490
00:22:06,235 --> 00:22:08,716
  to produce it in meaningful   
          quantities.           

491
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,733
 It's about two cents a person, 
        actually.               

492
00:22:11,767 --> 00:22:15,454
 I mean, if every U.S. citizen  
        paid two cents,         

493
00:22:15,488 --> 00:22:18,437
 we'd have enough to inoculate  
  the entire city of Phoenix.   

494
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:20,282
        Or Philadelphia.        

495
00:22:20,316 --> 00:22:23,400
        Or San Antonio.         

496
00:22:23,434 --> 00:22:25,444
    Just astounding, right?     

497
00:22:30,005 --> 00:22:31,983
          NEWSCASTER:           
 ...with the new increase       

498
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:35,335
     and the mystery virus,     
nobody knows very much about it.

499
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,146
        A short time ago        
it was completely unknown.      

500
00:22:37,214 --> 00:22:38,855
            How are you feeling?

501
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:40,867
              Hey.              

502
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:42,879
Pretty amazing, actually.       

503
00:22:42,914 --> 00:22:45,896
    They hydrated me,           
 they gave me some antibiotics. 

504
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,908
Hell of a house call.           

505
00:22:47,943 --> 00:22:49,718
How about you?                  

506
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:51,562
        I'm fine.               

507
00:22:51,596 --> 00:22:52,836
    It-it's all gone.           

508
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,680
  The achiness. The dizziness.  

509
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,155
 He said it was all in my head. 

510
00:22:56,223 --> 00:22:59,039
     I guess he was right.      

511
00:22:59,073 --> 00:23:02,358
Did anyone explain this to you, 
what they were doing here?      

512
00:23:02,393 --> 00:23:03,597
No one had to.                  

513
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:05,710
It's all over the TV.           

514
00:23:05,745 --> 00:23:08,727
Representatives from FEMA       
and a Phoenix biotech firm      

515
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,236
        began showing up        
        on the doorsteps        

516
00:23:10,271 --> 00:23:12,750
  of police and rescue workers  
before dawn this morning,       

517
00:23:12,818 --> 00:23:15,701
  concerned that they may have  
contracted a deadly virus.      

518
00:23:15,735 --> 00:23:18,684
So far none of the city workers 
      have tested positive      

519
00:23:18,753 --> 00:23:20,127
      and officials remain      
          tight-lipped          

520
00:23:20,195 --> 00:23:22,139
 about whether or not the virus 
        remains a threat        

521
00:23:22,173 --> 00:23:23,413
    to the general populace.    

522
00:23:23,447 --> 00:23:26,396
So much for secrets.            

523
00:23:26,431 --> 00:23:28,408
     (elevator bell dings)      

524
00:23:37,963 --> 00:23:39,974
     (elevator bell dings)      

525
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:44,300
        (phones ringing)        

526
00:23:53,989 --> 00:23:55,799
                        DEVALOS:
        You feeling left out?   

527
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:56,972
                You want one?   

528
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,549
        A mask, I mean.         

529
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,225
 I know a guy who knows a guy.  

530
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,599
        Oh, no, no, no.         
        I'm holding out         

531
00:24:01,634 --> 00:24:03,779
for one of those full body suits

532
00:24:03,813 --> 00:24:06,696
    that those guys who came    
 to my house this morning had.  

533
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:09,176
          Lot of fear.          

534
00:24:09,211 --> 00:24:12,194
      About 20% of the staff are
          taking a personal day.

535
00:24:12,228 --> 00:24:14,406
About to have a little briefing 
    in the conference room.     

536
00:24:14,508 --> 00:24:15,613
    You want to come along?     

537
00:24:15,681 --> 00:24:17,659
             Yeah.              

538
00:24:19,101 --> 00:24:20,676
     As soon as we realized     

539
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:23,694
that this Lomis fellow had been 
infected with the missing virus 

540
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:26,375
  and the fact that he worked   
     for United Southfield,     

541
00:24:26,411 --> 00:24:28,320
    we began investigating.     

542
00:24:28,354 --> 00:24:31,874
  Dr. Westphal gave us access   
    to his office computers,    

543
00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:34,723
and we obtained a warrant       
    for his laptop as well.     

544
00:24:35,764 --> 00:24:37,674
  We discovered that Mr. Lomis  

545
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:39,082
    had been using an alias     

546
00:24:39,116 --> 00:24:42,200
      to log onto several       
    anti-American Web sites,    

547
00:24:42,234 --> 00:24:46,055
and that he had indeed contacted
a potential buyer for the virus.

548
00:24:46,089 --> 00:24:48,067
     Now the good news is,      

549
00:24:48,101 --> 00:24:51,520
the e-mails indicate that       
 the sale was never completed.  

550
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:55,578
Our best guess is that Mr. Lomis
 inadvertently infected himself 

551
00:24:55,612 --> 00:24:57,924
      as he was attempting      
    to dispose of the virus     

552
00:24:57,959 --> 00:25:01,444
  as soon he realized that the  
 sale was not going to happen.  

553
00:25:01,479 --> 00:25:04,260
         We now believe         

554
00:25:04,328 --> 00:25:08,150
  that everything that he had   
        was in that car.        

555
00:25:08,184 --> 00:25:12,005
We believe that everything      
that he had burned up with him. 

556
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:15,324
    And so I'm pleased          
to inform you this morning      

557
00:25:15,358 --> 00:25:17,169
that even as we're sitting here,

558
00:25:17,203 --> 00:25:19,683
the mayor's office is announcing
     to the general public      

559
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:23,204
    that there is no longer     
any threat from the FV-39 virus.

560
00:25:29,105 --> 00:25:31,450
    And just when you think     

561
00:25:31,485 --> 00:25:33,428
that there is nothing good      

562
00:25:33,463 --> 00:25:36,312
  that can come from something  
  potentially so frightening,   

563
00:25:36,346 --> 00:25:39,162
the folks on Capitol Hill       
      woke up this morning      

564
00:25:39,197 --> 00:25:42,179
and heard about the panic       
that was slowly spreading       

565
00:25:42,214 --> 00:25:44,191
throughout the Southwest,       

566
00:25:44,226 --> 00:25:47,208
and I've been told that an      
 appropriation is in the works  

567
00:25:47,243 --> 00:25:49,756
    to allocate $60 million     

568
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:52,807
    for the production          
      of FV-39 antiserum.       

569
00:25:59,045 --> 00:26:01,021
Looks like we're all            
going to live.                  

570
00:26:01,056 --> 00:26:03,871
Which means I'll get            
another shot at this.           

571
00:26:03,905 --> 00:26:06,888
        Oh, I'm sorry last night
            didn't go the way   
                 that you hoped.

572
00:26:06,922 --> 00:26:08,229
Eh, it's okay.                  

573
00:26:08,264 --> 00:26:09,939
If it was meant to be,          
it would've been.               

574
00:26:09,974 --> 00:26:11,214
     You know, it's funny.      

575
00:26:11,248 --> 00:26:13,057
  One of my daughters told me   
    yesterday morning           

576
00:26:13,092 --> 00:26:14,934
      that she had a dream      
      about you proposing.      

577
00:26:14,969 --> 00:26:17,081
So I kinda knew it wasn't going 
     to happen last night.      

578
00:26:17,115 --> 00:26:18,287
              Why?              

579
00:26:18,322 --> 00:26:21,002
When did she have me proposing? 

580
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,210
              No.               

581
00:26:22,312 --> 00:26:25,261
     It wasn't about when.      

582
00:26:25,296 --> 00:26:27,306
You know what? Never mind.      
  Forget that I said anything.  

583
00:26:27,374 --> 00:26:28,915
 I promised myself I wouldn't.  

584
00:26:28,949 --> 00:26:30,826
Well, wait a minute. Don't      
 let me make a fool of myself.  

585
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,235
      If there's something      
        I should know...        

586
00:26:32,302 --> 00:26:34,313
      No. There's nothing       
        you should know.        

587
00:26:37,231 --> 00:26:38,873
            (sighs):            
        I mean...               

588
00:26:38,907 --> 00:26:40,616
you were sad last night, right? 

589
00:26:40,651 --> 00:26:42,962
    We both were. We thought    
  the world was going to end.   

590
00:26:42,997 --> 00:26:44,471
    Okay, well, that was it.    

591
00:26:44,506 --> 00:26:45,779
      That was her dream.       

592
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,494
    That she saw you getting    
        ready to propose        

593
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:50,440
but instead you were sad.       

594
00:26:50,474 --> 00:26:52,485
    So, it already happened.    
You have nothing to worry about.

595
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:54,731
            DINOVI:             
 How you doing out there?       

596
00:26:54,765 --> 00:26:57,245
Just getting locked and loaded. 

597
00:26:58,955 --> 00:27:00,397
                 I hate to leave
                    you guys,   

598
00:27:00,465 --> 00:27:01,705
            but I've had this   
             dinner on the books

599
00:27:01,773 --> 00:27:02,911
            with the head of the
                 Teacher's Union

600
00:27:02,979 --> 00:27:04,151
        for weeks.              

601
00:27:04,186 --> 00:27:05,359
          Are you sure          
    you're going to be okay?    

602
00:27:05,393 --> 00:27:07,035
Mm-hmm. Better than okay.       

603
00:27:07,069 --> 00:27:08,912
        Hi, cutes.              

604
00:27:09,013 --> 00:27:10,958
     Hi.                        
            So this woman I'm   
                meeting with?   

605
00:27:11,025 --> 00:27:12,935
        She has a reputation for
      being kind of long-winded.

606
00:27:13,037 --> 00:27:14,209
      I wouldn't wait up.       

607
00:27:14,244 --> 00:27:15,718
Hey, as soon                    
as she hits the hay,            

608
00:27:15,754 --> 00:27:17,730
I'm hitting the hay.            
    Uh, what else, what else?   

609
00:27:17,765 --> 00:27:19,373
        Uh, I've got my cell,   

610
00:27:19,441 --> 00:27:21,250
            the phone number for
                the restaurant's
                  on the fridge,

611
00:27:21,285 --> 00:27:22,458
                and, uh...      
You know what, Lynn?            

612
00:27:22,492 --> 00:27:24,134
          We're good.           

613
00:27:24,168 --> 00:27:25,508
         You just go do         
    what you gotta do.          

614
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,151
          Okay, okay.           

615
00:27:27,185 --> 00:27:28,325
        I'm going.              

616
00:27:28,392 --> 00:27:29,531
              Mmm.              

617
00:27:29,633 --> 00:27:31,543
                  Okay.         
Oh, Mama.                       

618
00:27:31,644 --> 00:27:33,018
Oh, Mama.                       
                    Bye.        

619
00:27:33,086 --> 00:27:35,398
(laughs)                        
            Bye, honey. Bye.    

620
00:27:35,467 --> 00:27:37,477
          (whispers):           
              Bye.              

621
00:27:47,804 --> 00:27:51,256
       I've been working       
      on the baby bottle       

622
00:27:51,324 --> 00:27:54,273
 All the live long day        

623
00:27:54,342 --> 00:27:57,459
       I've been working       
      on the baby bottle       

624
00:27:57,527 --> 00:27:59,840
  Just to pass the time away  

625
00:27:59,874 --> 00:28:01,651
         (phone rings)          

626
00:28:01,718 --> 00:28:04,701
         Can't you hear        
    the phone a-ringing...     

627
00:28:04,735 --> 00:28:06,377
What do you think, little Leigh?

628
00:28:06,411 --> 00:28:08,892
  Should we let the answering   
    machine grab that?          

629
00:28:08,926 --> 00:28:10,904
    (machine clicks, beeps)     
         I'm with you.          

630
00:28:10,938 --> 00:28:12,244
     Hi, Lynn. It's Jenny.      

631
00:28:12,312 --> 00:28:13,921
    I just left this message    
          on your cell          

632
00:28:13,955 --> 00:28:16,401
and I called your apartment and 
 then I found this number, too, 

633
00:28:16,436 --> 00:28:18,916
and thought maybe I'd catch you 
     here, but I guess not.     

634
00:28:18,951 --> 00:28:20,928
          Anyway, uh,           
     Larry Birkbaum called.     

635
00:28:20,963 --> 00:28:22,939
He wanted to let you know       
 he's running a half hour late  

636
00:28:22,974 --> 00:28:24,784
      for dinner tonight.       
          Oh, and, uh,          

637
00:28:24,818 --> 00:28:26,627
he can't wait to see you.       

638
00:28:26,662 --> 00:28:27,834
         Okay. Thanks.          

639
00:28:27,903 --> 00:28:29,074
          That's all.           

640
00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:35,779
        (kissing)               

641
00:28:39,402 --> 00:28:40,877
    What was that for?          

642
00:28:40,911 --> 00:28:42,485
That was for                    
"I'm feeling better."           

643
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,302
  That was for "I haven't been  
able to kiss you in days."      

644
00:28:45,403 --> 00:28:47,179
                    (giggles)   

645
00:28:47,214 --> 00:28:48,520
That was for...                 

646
00:28:48,554 --> 00:28:51,035
"nobody's going to get          
a deadly virus                  

647
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:53,214
        "and bleed from their   
                  eyes and nose,

648
00:28:53,282 --> 00:28:56,265
             get things all over
            their face and die."

649
00:28:56,299 --> 00:28:59,283
            Not tonight, anyway.

650
00:28:59,317 --> 00:29:02,266
That's a good answer.           

651
00:29:02,301 --> 00:29:03,640
                     What a day.

652
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:05,082
    Ugh.                        

653
00:29:06,189 --> 00:29:08,938
            How many            
almost disasters are there      

654
00:29:08,972 --> 00:29:10,916
that we never hear about?       

655
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:13,933
Government or big business      
         don't tell us          

656
00:29:14,069 --> 00:29:15,375
  because they don't have to.   

657
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:17,387
  Makes you grateful there are  
    people like that doctor     

658
00:29:17,421 --> 00:29:18,594
who was here this morning.      

659
00:29:18,628 --> 00:29:20,203
            Mm-hmm.             

660
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:26,238
          Mmm.                  

661
00:29:26,272 --> 00:29:27,646
What was that one for?          

662
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,289
                That was to hold
                me till morning.

663
00:29:29,323 --> 00:29:32,339
      Another good answer.      

664
00:29:34,687 --> 00:29:36,665
    (knocking on door)          
        WESTPHAL:               
           Come on in.          

665
00:29:37,672 --> 00:29:40,185
Okay, Erik, I'm here.           

666
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,297
What's so important you needed  
to get me out of bed            

667
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:43,839
at 11:30 and rush over?         

668
00:29:43,873 --> 00:29:47,694
     Don't get mad at me...     

669
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:49,874
but I hacked into your computer.

670
00:29:49,908 --> 00:29:52,958
      I read your e-mail.       

671
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:58,021
It's not happening, is it?      

672
00:29:58,055 --> 00:30:00,066
I'm sorry.                      

673
00:30:03,017 --> 00:30:06,000
    They don't buy it.          

674
00:30:06,034 --> 00:30:07,845
  They all think it's a setup.  

675
00:30:07,879 --> 00:30:10,493
     That maybe I'm working     
      with the government.      

676
00:30:12,506 --> 00:30:14,751
     So it's not happening.     

677
00:30:14,786 --> 00:30:17,768
Maybe you picked the wrong guy. 

678
00:30:19,546 --> 00:30:22,328
    I think deep down,          

679
00:30:22,395 --> 00:30:26,216
 I don't want to be the one who 
 sells this virus to some nuts. 

680
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:29,267
     Gets a lot of innocent     
          people hurt.          

681
00:30:30,945 --> 00:30:33,928
        I mean...               

682
00:30:33,962 --> 00:30:35,973
     I'd do it if I had to.     

683
00:30:36,008 --> 00:30:38,990
  You think you don't have to?  

684
00:30:39,025 --> 00:30:42,008
You see Congress approving      
  production of our antiserum?  

685
00:30:42,076 --> 00:30:44,019
  Neither do I. You know why?   

686
00:30:44,088 --> 00:30:47,037
Because they can't see microbes.

687
00:30:47,072 --> 00:30:49,216
They can see planes flying      
        into buildings.         

688
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:52,233
 They can see suicide bombers.  

689
00:30:52,301 --> 00:30:54,211
  But they can't see microbes.  

690
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:57,262
(sniffling)                     

691
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,878
                 Are you crying?

692
00:30:59,945 --> 00:31:02,962
    Oh, God, don't... don't cry.

693
00:31:02,997 --> 00:31:06,013
        I'm sorry.              

694
00:31:06,047 --> 00:31:08,830
          (sniffling)           

695
00:31:08,897 --> 00:31:10,874
 Are we going to be all right?  

696
00:31:10,909 --> 00:31:13,690
Are you asking me if there'll be
 money to pay for your alimony? 

697
00:31:13,725 --> 00:31:15,333
No.                             

698
00:31:15,434 --> 00:31:18,888
I'm asking you if we're         
going to be all right.          

699
00:31:23,347 --> 00:31:25,324
                 Come here.     

700
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,095
  We're going to be just fine.  

701
00:31:51,107 --> 00:31:53,118
             Good.              

702
00:31:55,733 --> 00:31:56,906
             Wait, don't go yet.

703
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,649
                  No, I want you
                    to see this.

704
00:31:58,683 --> 00:31:59,655
        See what?               

705
00:32:01,735 --> 00:32:03,143
              Me.               

706
00:32:03,177 --> 00:32:05,188
    Drinking the last           
    of the antiserum.           

707
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,065
      I don't understand.       

708
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,305
    Why are you doing that?     

709
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:11,356
    Well, it's the only way     
         I can survive.         

710
00:32:13,838 --> 00:32:16,686
 I had to expose myself to the  
 virus in order to infect you.  

711
00:32:16,722 --> 00:32:18,732
     And now that I'm sure      
         you have it...         

712
00:32:18,766 --> 00:32:20,911
        Are you serious?        

713
00:32:20,946 --> 00:32:22,922
 You got about 12 hours, Mitch. 

714
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,599
         Be a good guy.         

715
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:26,611
    Go out and infect           
        lots of people.         

716
00:32:26,646 --> 00:32:28,455
        Or don't.               

717
00:32:28,523 --> 00:32:31,003
    As long as they find your   
      body covered with lesions,

718
00:32:31,071 --> 00:32:34,624
    blood running from your eyes
    and nose, what do I care?   

719
00:32:34,692 --> 00:32:36,032
          Do me favor.          

720
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,009
Close the door on your way out. 

721
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,016
          Mrs. Dubois.          

722
00:32:45,084 --> 00:32:46,793
          Come on in.           

723
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:49,810
Oh, uh,                         
we better not.                  

724
00:32:49,879 --> 00:32:51,722
  Little bit of a cold.         

725
00:32:51,757 --> 00:32:53,499
It's good to see you again.     

726
00:32:53,566 --> 00:32:54,706
(clears throat)                 

727
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,416
Hope you're feeling better.     

728
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:58,428
                 Oh, physically,
                    much better.

729
00:33:00,003 --> 00:33:01,545
      Certainly busy here.      

730
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:04,462
Oh, we have antiserum           
to manufacture.                 

731
00:33:04,496 --> 00:33:06,574
We're finally getting           
to do the work                  

732
00:33:06,642 --> 00:33:08,720
that we were meant to do.       

733
00:33:08,754 --> 00:33:11,670
      Feels good.               

734
00:33:11,738 --> 00:33:14,520
So, um, what can I do for you?  

735
00:33:14,554 --> 00:33:16,733
      Well, you can admit       

736
00:33:16,767 --> 00:33:19,415
    that you murdered           
    your friend, Dr. Lomis,     

737
00:33:19,449 --> 00:33:25,013
and that this entire panic      
about FV-39 virus is contrived. 

738
00:33:26,322 --> 00:33:28,500
 Why would you say that?        

739
00:33:30,715 --> 00:33:33,228
Why would you even think that?  

740
00:33:34,905 --> 00:33:36,849
 None of that is true.          

741
00:33:36,883 --> 00:33:38,022
     None of it.                

742
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,866
      (coughing)                

743
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:45,197
     Please, Dr. Westphal.      

744
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,543
  We both know that it's true.  

745
00:33:47,578 --> 00:33:49,991
    That you are a pompous,     
         self-consumed,         

746
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:52,471
      self-aggrandized man      
    who thinks he's smarter     

747
00:33:52,506 --> 00:33:54,618
        and knows better        
      than everybody else.      

748
00:33:54,652 --> 00:33:57,133
     You infected Dr. Lomis     
        with that virus,        

749
00:33:57,167 --> 00:34:00,049
    and you didn't even care    
     who else he infected.      

750
00:34:00,084 --> 00:34:01,658
    In fact, it was only due    

751
00:34:01,726 --> 00:34:04,173
    to Dr. Lomis's own sense    
        of decency              

752
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:06,922
    that other people           
    didn't get sick and die.    

753
00:34:06,956 --> 00:34:09,369
Where is this coming from?      

754
00:34:09,403 --> 00:34:11,514
         This... story?         

755
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,392
    It's not a story.           

756
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,874
You know it's not a story.      

757
00:34:15,908 --> 00:34:18,388
 Well, can you prove any of it? 

758
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:25,361
    You can't prove it          
     because it's not true.     

759
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:28,211
  Just 'cause I can't prove it  
doesn't mean it's not so.       

760
00:34:28,246 --> 00:34:29,351
             Fine.              

761
00:34:29,386 --> 00:34:30,659
     Believe what you like.     

762
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,201
    I have work to do.          

763
00:34:32,235 --> 00:34:33,609
    Lives to protect.           

764
00:34:34,683 --> 00:34:36,526
I'm going to go talk to my boss.

765
00:34:36,594 --> 00:34:39,141
Then I'm going to go talk       
     to that man from FEMA,     

766
00:34:39,175 --> 00:34:41,789
        and I'm going to tell   
            them what I know.   

767
00:34:41,857 --> 00:34:42,996
    And you're right.           

768
00:34:43,032 --> 00:34:44,773
I might not be able to prove it,

769
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:47,925
but I might be able to get them 
     to take a second look      

770
00:34:47,992 --> 00:34:50,338
    at those appropriations     
      for your antiserum.       

771
00:34:50,374 --> 00:34:52,452
  I might be able to get them   

772
00:34:52,486 --> 00:34:55,937
    to put the brakes           
        on all of this.         

773
00:34:57,347 --> 00:34:59,358
     Why would you do that?     

774
00:35:01,403 --> 00:35:04,186
  Why would you deny hundreds   
     of thousands of people     

775
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,934
 the chance to live in the face 
  of a potential catastrophe?   

776
00:35:06,969 --> 00:35:08,678
To prove what?                  

777
00:35:08,745 --> 00:35:11,494
To gain what?                   

778
00:35:12,669 --> 00:35:15,082
      Talk about pompous.       

779
00:35:15,116 --> 00:35:17,730
Self-aggrandized, self-consumed.

780
00:35:22,123 --> 00:35:24,100
(sighs)                         

781
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:34,024
        (keys jangling)         

782
00:35:37,345 --> 00:35:39,187
                         DINOVI:
                    You're home.

783
00:35:39,255 --> 00:35:40,427
I wanted to surprise you.       

784
00:35:40,496 --> 00:35:41,501
    The baby's asleep.          

785
00:35:41,535 --> 00:35:42,842
     I was going to change.     

786
00:35:43,882 --> 00:35:45,893
    Something special?          

787
00:35:46,966 --> 00:35:49,379
    Uh, just things we need     
         to talk about.         

788
00:35:58,701 --> 00:36:00,241
     (sighs)                    

789
00:36:00,309 --> 00:36:01,985
      Talk.                     

790
00:36:03,897 --> 00:36:05,673
                I can't do it   
                      like this.

791
00:36:05,741 --> 00:36:07,215
                     Do you want
                      some wine?

792
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:09,227
No. Let's just talk.            

793
00:36:09,261 --> 00:36:10,467
You got something on your mind. 

794
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:11,708
I got something on my mind.     

795
00:36:11,743 --> 00:36:13,586
          I was asleep          
 when you got home last night.  

796
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,463
        You were asleep         
  when I got up this morning.   

797
00:36:15,497 --> 00:36:17,139
 Let's just do it. Let's talk.  

798
00:36:19,689 --> 00:36:21,900
Okay, I'll start.               

799
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,515
How is Larry Birkbaum?          

800
00:36:25,555 --> 00:36:27,130
              Wow.              

801
00:36:27,198 --> 00:36:29,109
        You know.               

802
00:36:30,182 --> 00:36:32,159
I'm a detective, Lynn.          

803
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,758
Why is my...                    

804
00:36:39,737 --> 00:36:41,011
Why are you having dinner       

805
00:36:41,045 --> 00:36:42,922
         with a lawyer          
    who practices family law    

806
00:36:42,956 --> 00:36:44,765
      when you told me you      
         were working?          

807
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,508
  I mean, this guy specializes  

808
00:36:46,543 --> 00:36:49,023
    in child support,           
        custody issues.         

809
00:36:49,058 --> 00:36:51,102
  Unless it's something else.   

810
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:53,716
Maybe the two of you            
are friends.                    

811
00:36:53,751 --> 00:36:55,426
              No.               

812
00:37:01,898 --> 00:37:03,272
    What's this?                

813
00:37:03,307 --> 00:37:04,848
    That's my divorce.          

814
00:37:06,861 --> 00:37:08,871
             What?              

815
00:37:08,906 --> 00:37:10,145
        You're married?         

816
00:37:10,213 --> 00:37:11,552
                          I was.

817
00:37:11,587 --> 00:37:14,336
                For a minute,   
                      in my 20s.

818
00:37:14,437 --> 00:37:17,587
Oh, and now is probably as good 
  a time as any to tell you...  

819
00:37:17,622 --> 00:37:19,465
    I wasn't a virgin           
    when we first met.          

820
00:37:22,551 --> 00:37:24,025
                 I know I should
                    have just   

821
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,266
    told you about it,          

822
00:37:25,334 --> 00:37:28,082
         but honestly,          
it meant so little to me.       

823
00:37:28,116 --> 00:37:29,993
     It lasted so briefly.      

824
00:37:30,027 --> 00:37:32,507
  And it happened so long ago.  

825
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,720
    It was so inconsequential   
                to both of us   

826
00:37:34,787 --> 00:37:35,960
                  that we didn't
                     even bother

827
00:37:35,995 --> 00:37:38,073
            to get it taken care
                 of at the time.

828
00:37:38,107 --> 00:37:40,420
    And then, when you          
and I first got together,       

829
00:37:40,487 --> 00:37:42,397
    things were so on-again,    
        off-again.              

830
00:37:44,075 --> 00:37:46,353
                  But now, since
                we're on again--

831
00:37:46,388 --> 00:37:48,231
                     really on--

832
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,176
                    I just...   

833
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:54,199
        I hated...              

834
00:37:54,267 --> 00:37:56,579
I really hated keeping something
        from you.               

835
00:37:58,424 --> 00:38:00,871
            Also...             

836
00:38:24,943 --> 00:38:27,122
    It's never going to fit     
         on my finger.          

837
00:38:27,156 --> 00:38:29,167
        (chuckles)              
            Shut up.            

838
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:31,950
        I want the knee.        

839
00:38:32,017 --> 00:38:33,425
    I want the whole thing.     

840
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,236
             Okay.              

841
00:38:38,422 --> 00:38:40,935
But before that happens...      

842
00:38:43,048 --> 00:38:45,931
you're going to have to tell me 

843
00:38:45,965 --> 00:38:48,344
    what I'm supposed to do     
        with this.              

844
00:38:55,151 --> 00:38:57,128
         Okay, you win.         

845
00:38:58,873 --> 00:39:00,884
But I still want the knee.      

846
00:39:05,646 --> 00:39:07,253
         (sighs)                

847
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,804
             Um...              

848
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:26,833
unaccustomed to public speaking 
        as I am...              

849
00:39:26,868 --> 00:39:29,147
    God, this better get better.

850
00:39:29,214 --> 00:39:31,426
        (laughing)              

851
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,337
(dog barking in distance)       

852
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:35,617
                    Go to sleep.

853
00:39:35,651 --> 00:39:37,730
How do you know                 
I'm not sleeping?               

854
00:39:37,831 --> 00:39:39,774
    I'm just psychic.           

855
00:39:39,809 --> 00:39:42,356
Well, how am I                  
supposed to sleep               

856
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:44,501
when I know...                  
I just...                       

857
00:39:44,535 --> 00:39:47,083
I know that                     
that evil bastard               

858
00:39:47,117 --> 00:39:49,362
is just sitting                 
in his house                    

859
00:39:49,397 --> 00:39:50,704
gloating to himself             

860
00:39:50,738 --> 00:39:52,480
about how he got away           
with everything.                

861
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,325
I mean, he killed a man.        

862
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:57,777
He marshaled the resources      
of an entire city--             

863
00:39:57,813 --> 00:40:00,997
the federal government, even--  
to get what he wanted.          

864
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,277
            I don't know what to
              tell you, Allison.

865
00:40:03,311 --> 00:40:06,059
             Sometimes, you just
                have to give up.

866
00:40:06,094 --> 00:40:09,144
        Sometimes, you just have
        to surrender to the idea

867
00:40:09,178 --> 00:40:11,792
        that everything works   
                 out in the end.

868
00:40:13,135 --> 00:40:14,608
                That, one way   
                     or another,

869
00:40:14,643 --> 00:40:17,726
    life has a way of eventually
         evening everything out.

870
00:40:17,794 --> 00:40:20,275
              Even the gloating,
                evil bastards   

871
00:40:20,309 --> 00:40:22,789
                    are going to
                     get theirs.

872
00:40:22,823 --> 00:40:24,264
                      But it can
                     only happen

873
00:40:24,332 --> 00:40:26,242
                if we get a full
                  night's sleep.

874
00:40:26,276 --> 00:40:27,583
Are you mocking me?             

875
00:40:27,618 --> 00:40:30,132
            No, I'm begging you.

876
00:40:31,875 --> 00:40:34,155
            A grateful nation   
                    salutes you.

877
00:40:34,222 --> 00:40:35,563
Quiet.                          

878
00:40:35,597 --> 00:40:37,641
I'm trying to sleep.            

879
00:40:37,709 --> 00:40:39,652
 (monitor beeping rhythmically) 

880
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:42,302
                            MAN:
        Good thing you called   
            911 when you did.   

881
00:40:42,336 --> 00:40:44,044
        (grunting)              

882
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,888
      (labored breathing)       

883
00:40:45,956 --> 00:40:47,532
        (coughing)              
                            Shh.

884
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,409
                     Just relax.

885
00:40:49,444 --> 00:40:51,990
                Dr. Westphal,   
            try not to speak.   

886
00:40:52,025 --> 00:40:54,940
     I know you're afraid,      
  but there's no reason to be.  

887
00:40:54,975 --> 00:40:58,596
  105 is a pretty good fever,   
      but we've seen more       

888
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,472
    than a few patients come    
    through our doors           

889
00:41:00,575 --> 00:41:02,283
    with this very same flu     
        you have,               

890
00:41:02,351 --> 00:41:04,026
 and everyone's pulled through. 

891
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:05,870
         We've just got         
     to keep you hydrated,      

892
00:41:05,939 --> 00:41:07,949
keep your electrolytes balanced,

893
00:41:07,983 --> 00:41:09,927
      and the medications       
      we're giving you...       

894
00:41:09,962 --> 00:41:12,978
    I'm betting we're looking   
              at 102 by morning.

895
00:41:20,858 --> 00:41:22,399
MAN:                            
Me?                             

896
00:41:22,467 --> 00:41:24,142
I'm betting 107.                

897
00:41:24,177 --> 00:41:26,456
But then your physician         
doesn't know you                

898
00:41:26,524 --> 00:41:28,031
as well as I do.                

899
00:41:28,099 --> 00:41:29,440
    He doesn't know you had     

900
00:41:29,475 --> 00:41:32,760
      an allergic reaction      
    to that antiserum.          

901
00:41:32,794 --> 00:41:35,777
  Sure, it cured the disease,   

902
00:41:35,811 --> 00:41:39,967
      kept you from dying       
  of viral hemorrhagic fever,   

903
00:41:40,001 --> 00:41:43,488
but we always knew              
a tiny part of the populace     

904
00:41:43,556 --> 00:41:45,633
would react badly               
to it.                          

905
00:41:45,668 --> 00:41:49,052
Which is why, when you          
felt that first itch            

906
00:41:49,087 --> 00:41:51,031
at the back                     
of your throat,                 

907
00:41:51,065 --> 00:41:53,110
must have been                  
a surprise, huh?                

908
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,786
You didn't wait.                

909
00:41:54,821 --> 00:41:58,038
You gave yourself               
a massive dose of steroids      

910
00:41:58,072 --> 00:41:59,781
to halt the reaction.           

911
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:03,268
Because you knew better.        

912
00:42:03,335 --> 00:42:07,594
    You were one step ahead,    
        as always.              

913
00:42:09,304 --> 00:42:13,863
     But you never counted      
          on the flu.           

914
00:42:13,897 --> 00:42:16,410
And now, with your immune system

915
00:42:16,478 --> 00:42:20,032
     completely compromised     
    by those steroids,          

916
00:42:20,066 --> 00:42:25,396
      your body has no way      
        to fight it off.        

917
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:30,257
  You might as well have FV-39  
      or the black plague,      

918
00:42:30,291 --> 00:42:33,006
  for all the immune response   
        you can muster.         

919
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,666
There you go.                   

920
00:42:37,735 --> 00:42:39,711
You go to sleep.                

921
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,797
For the very last time.         

922
00:42:42,831 --> 00:42:45,143
That's right, Erik.             

923
00:42:45,178 --> 00:42:48,328
You are going to die.           

924
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:51,479
        You know,               

925
00:42:51,547 --> 00:42:55,100
    I'd kiss you good night     
          if I could.           

926
00:42:55,169 --> 00:42:59,392
        But, hey,               
you can't have everything.      

927
00:42:59,459 --> 00:43:01,504
             Whoa.              

928
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:04,119
    You okay?                   

929
00:43:04,154 --> 00:43:05,996
Everything all right?           

930
00:43:06,065 --> 00:43:08,209
                     It's better
                 than all right.

931
00:43:08,277 --> 00:43:09,953
             Everything's great.

932
00:43:16,022 --> 00:43:18,267
Don't worry about me.           

933
00:43:19,542 --> 00:43:21,553
I've totally surrendered.
