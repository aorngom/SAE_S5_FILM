1
00:00:00,595 --> 00:00:01,993
My name is Jane Vasco.

2
00:00:02,049 --> 00:00:03,355
I could use you on my team.

3
00:00:03,468 --> 00:00:07,017
I work for a secret government
agency that hunts Neuros.

4
00:00:07,064 --> 00:00:10,405
People who can do dangerous
things with their minds.

5
00:00:11,162 --> 00:00:12,650
On my first assignment...

6
00:00:12,688 --> 00:00:14,765
something a little weird happened,

7
00:00:14,905 --> 00:00:17,799
okay, something really weird.

8
00:00:18,395 --> 00:00:21,308
Until I get some answers
I'm getting on with my life,

9
00:00:21,663 --> 00:00:23,039
doing my job...

10
00:00:23,144 --> 00:00:25,067
stocking up on aspirin...

11
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:27,743
because I gotta tell ya,

12
00:00:28,492 --> 00:00:30,321
pain's a bitch!

13
00:00:33,876 --> 00:00:36,013
MAGICIAN'S PALACE

14
00:00:45,976 --> 00:00:47,869
He's actually pretty good.

15
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,961
It's child's play.
Cheap tricks.

16
00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:54,650
Maybe.

17
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:57,747
All any of us have to do is... better.

18
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:02,603
- So, what're you guys doing tonight?
- Levitation.

19
00:01:02,872 --> 00:01:05,558
Wow, ambitious!

20
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:10,419
But... isn't there something
in the rules against that?

21
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:12,248
I don't recall any rules about that.

22
00:01:12,316 --> 00:01:15,334
Yeah, the rules strictly prohibit
any pre-rigging of the stage.

23
00:01:16,084 --> 00:01:18,952
- How you guys're gonna set up your wire rig?
- Wire rig?

24
00:01:19,301 --> 00:01:20,497
Yeah.

25
00:01:20,785 --> 00:01:23,073
How else are you going
to perform levitation?

26
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:25,383
Magic.

27
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:30,222
Next, Howard Morris.
The amazing Howie!

28
00:01:39,264 --> 00:01:40,819
Marcia!

29
00:02:05,546 --> 00:02:07,744
Gentlemen, as you know,

30
00:02:07,947 --> 00:02:12,385
the rules for tonight's audition strictly
forbid any use of stage apparatus.

31
00:02:13,365 --> 00:02:16,846
I assure you gentlemen, there is none.

32
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:49,072
And now, if you expected any gimmicks,

33
00:02:49,246 --> 00:02:51,645
prepare to watch in wonder...

34
00:02:51,735 --> 00:02:56,356
as you experience true magic.

35
00:02:56,813 --> 00:02:58,489
True magic.

36
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,795
What do you make of that, Andre?

37
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:55,690
PAINKILLER JANE 1x14 "THE AMAZING HOWIE"
Subtitles subXpacio and TusSeries

38
00:03:56,929 --> 00:03:59,414
Some things carry over from childhood.

39
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:02,745
Okay, using my teddy
bears for target practice,

40
00:04:02,957 --> 00:04:05,262
wasn't particularly childlike.

41
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:08,126
But I knew what I wanted
to do when I grew up.

42
00:04:08,135 --> 00:04:09,945
For some kids it was music,

43
00:04:10,014 --> 00:04:12,276
others wanted to be police officers.

44
00:04:12,596 --> 00:04:17,123
And sometimes our childhood dreams
don't work out the way we planned.

45
00:04:17,516 --> 00:04:21,094
Come to think of it, entering
the subway in the morning,

46
00:04:21,244 --> 00:04:25,534
feels kind of like going
into a kid's secret clubhouse.

47
00:04:27,132 --> 00:04:30,568
Only in adulthood, the other
kids in the clubhouse...

48
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,979
are professionals on a team...

49
00:04:33,168 --> 00:04:35,773
Well, at least we pretend we are.

50
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:38,985
Morning.

51
00:04:39,443 --> 00:04:42,017
- Is it?
- Have you been here all night?

52
00:04:43,223 --> 00:04:45,096
What are you working on?

53
00:04:46,676 --> 00:04:47,902
Maybe I don't want to know.

54
00:04:47,993 --> 00:04:52,809
Last night I saw a woman
levitate into the air.

55
00:04:52,942 --> 00:04:54,822
And then you woke up?

56
00:04:55,615 --> 00:04:58,027
It wasn't a dream.
It was a magic trick.

57
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,277
- I see.
- Jane, I know this trick.

58
00:05:00,312 --> 00:05:03,485
Ok, I know how it's done, but this guy,
Howie, he didn't do it like that.

59
00:05:03,572 --> 00:05:07,019
I mean this woman, she really levitated.

60
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:09,107
- Okay...
- What is okay?

61
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:13,458
What the heck is okay about a real
live human female levitating,

62
00:05:13,551 --> 00:05:15,451
with no gimmicks involved, nothing?

63
00:05:16,084 --> 00:05:17,919
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:18,112 --> 00:05:19,946
Jane, don't you see what this means?

65
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,260
No, what does it mean?

66
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:24,481
Oh, great.

67
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:29,051
Either this guy Howie is smarter than
I am, which we all know is impossible,

68
00:05:29,164 --> 00:05:31,730
or it's something else that should
be very obvious to all of you.

69
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,290
Howie's a Neuro.

70
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:36,245
Because he performed a magic trick
that you can't figure out.

71
00:05:36,441 --> 00:05:38,298
There's no other explanation.

72
00:05:38,847 --> 00:05:40,743
Mental meltdown, yours?

73
00:05:40,831 --> 00:05:44,476
- Ok, guys, you weren't there last night.
- Where exactly is there?

74
00:05:46,206 --> 00:05:49,816
The Magician's Palace.
It's a very exclusive club.

75
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,664
Once a year, they hold auditions for
amateur magicians who want to join.

76
00:05:54,702 --> 00:05:56,609
And what were you doing there?

77
00:05:58,744 --> 00:06:00,240
Research.

78
00:06:01,893 --> 00:06:04,814
Is there something that came up
on your radar that I'm unaware of?

79
00:06:04,915 --> 00:06:08,253
No. I just figured, you know, the more
we know the better prepared we are.

80
00:06:08,715 --> 00:06:11,625
Yeah, you know, boss, just in case
a Neuro wants to saw one of us in half.

81
00:06:11,795 --> 00:06:14,384
Hey, boss, I know we were dealing
with a bunch of comedians.

82
00:06:15,337 --> 00:06:17,193
How'd the tryout go, Ri?

83
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,371
- Who said anything about me trying out?
- Wait a second.

84
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,817
You do magic?

85
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:29,383
- Why am I not surprised.
- Ok, yes! I do magic, ok?

86
00:06:29,494 --> 00:06:31,763
And last night I made it to
the final round of auditions.

87
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,114
And so did this guy, Howie.

88
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:35,799
Ok, boss, This trick that he did,
it was impossible.

89
00:06:35,955 --> 00:06:38,139
- Or just a really good trick.
- No.

90
00:06:38,174 --> 00:06:40,219
No, I mean, I've been working
on this thing all night.

91
00:06:40,232 --> 00:06:42,938
- There's only one explanation.
- He's better than you.

92
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,741
Are you guys dense?

93
00:06:44,927 --> 00:06:48,126
You guys can't even spot a Neuro when all
the evidence is right there in front of you.

94
00:06:48,212 --> 00:06:50,861
Well, maybe we need a volunteer
from the audience to help us out.

95
00:06:50,896 --> 00:06:52,975
Madam, you, you come
help us please!

96
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:56,769
Okay, it's not going to be on my shoulders,
when Howie's powers escalate, ok?

97
00:06:56,994 --> 00:06:58,630
I mean, who knows what he's capable of.

98
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:01,219
- Yes, just, Connor, shut up.
- Yeah.

99
00:07:01,857 --> 00:07:04,681
This is not enough evidence to move
forward. You're gonna have to let it go.

100
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:07,115
Oh, if only the blind could see.

101
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,269
We've got a new lead on that...
what did you call it?

102
00:07:09,293 --> 00:07:12,165
It's a shape-shifter
- Right, the one we lost in Virginia...

103
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,600
Right now that's top priority.
Let's roll.

104
00:07:14,765 --> 00:07:16,943
Boss, when we find this
guy, you chip him.

105
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,792
We'll get Riley to pull
a quarter out of his ear.

106
00:07:18,817 --> 00:07:20,668
Ok, I heard that!

107
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:24,109
He pet.

108
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:19,685
oh!

109
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:23,411
- Hi.
- Hey! How we...

110
00:09:26,327 --> 00:09:28,059
- Looking for this?
- Look,

111
00:09:28,316 --> 00:09:29,809
I realize that probably shouldn't be here.

112
00:09:29,923 --> 00:09:32,053
No.
You really shouldn't.

113
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:36,820
Look Howie, I'm really sorry. It's just...
I got so nervous about tomorrow's audition,

114
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,021
I know you're going to have
something amazing,

115
00:09:39,044 --> 00:09:41,450
I just came here to find
what I'm up against.

116
00:09:41,934 --> 00:09:44,445
You're that desperate to get
into the magician's palace?

117
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:48,476
- Yeah, it's pathetic, I know.
- I could have you disqualified.

118
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,678
If I were you, I would.

119
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,187
Everybody makes mistakes, Ri.

120
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,225
May the best man win.

121
00:10:03,393 --> 00:10:05,171
Really.

122
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,815
Okay.
Thanks.

123
00:10:12,388 --> 00:10:16,116
Hey, Ri. Any hot dates float your way?

124
00:10:16,247 --> 00:10:19,197
- What do you want?
- I need a favor.

125
00:10:21,064 --> 00:10:23,058
Can you hack into Seth's database?

126
00:10:23,114 --> 00:10:25,215
Yes. Why would I want to?

127
00:10:25,373 --> 00:10:27,530
Seth ran some tests
on me last week,

128
00:10:27,912 --> 00:10:30,984
and every time I ask for the results,
he says he doesn't have them yet.

129
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:33,781
Well, I think he does and he's
keeping something from me.

130
00:10:33,816 --> 00:10:38,410
- I just want to know the truth.
- Okay... why would I want to?

131
00:10:39,775 --> 00:10:42,288
- I'll owe you one?
- You already owe me one.

132
00:10:42,605 --> 00:10:45,508
Besides, I'm busy.
I got to prepare for my audition.

133
00:10:45,689 --> 00:10:48,482
Which I'm not going to win
because Howie is a Neuro.

134
00:10:48,544 --> 00:10:52,027
Okay, okay. I wouldn't
ask if it wasn't important.

135
00:10:52,712 --> 00:10:54,468
My job's important.

136
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:57,943
- Besides, if Andre finds out about this...
- All right, fine.

137
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,113
Don't help me.

138
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:03,078
I'm just the girl
who can heal from anything.

139
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:06,848
Jane, wait!

140
00:11:12,935 --> 00:11:14,796
- I'll make you a deal.
- I'm listening.

141
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,958
I'll get the test results from Seth.

142
00:11:18,305 --> 00:11:20,306
But you have to do me a favor in return.

143
00:11:21,744 --> 00:11:23,851
And what might that favour be?

144
00:11:32,177 --> 00:11:34,687
- You can't be serious.
- Quit your complaining.

145
00:11:34,755 --> 00:11:36,802
This is what all the best
assistants are wearing.

146
00:11:40,222 --> 00:11:42,390
So, you got your stuff covered?
You know what to do?

147
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:45,112
Riley, if you make me go
over this one more time...

148
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,750
I just want to make sure
it goes off without a hitch.

149
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,946
Oh man, these judges are
going to be blown away.

150
00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:55,904
- I thought that was my job.
- Ladies and gentlemen, Riley Jensen.

151
00:11:56,979 --> 00:11:58,485
How do I look?

152
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:02,754
It's show time!

153
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:12,498
For my next illusion,

154
00:12:12,517 --> 00:12:16,535
I'll need some help
from my lovely assistant, Jane.

155
00:12:24,636 --> 00:12:27,458
A 38-caliber revolver.

156
00:12:33,413 --> 00:12:36,624
Please examine it to confirm that
hasn't been modified in any way.

157
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:39,184
The ammunition, please.

158
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:47,344
And if you wouldn't mind loading it, sir.

159
00:12:56,711 --> 00:13:00,824
Solid steel, six inches thick.

160
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:06,216
Are you satisfied that the gun
and the ammunition are genuine?

161
00:13:07,732 --> 00:13:09,758
They appear to be.

162
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,216
Excellent.

163
00:13:41,778 --> 00:13:45,907
Is this, in fact, a spent
38 caliber slug?

164
00:13:50,052 --> 00:13:54,077
It's still warm.
And there's blood.

165
00:13:58,793 --> 00:14:02,362
Very impressive,
Mr. Jensen.

166
00:14:04,907 --> 00:14:07,343
Howard Morris.

167
00:14:12,596 --> 00:14:15,306
All the best assistants
are wearing them?

168
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,489
Wait. If I may...

169
00:14:21,017 --> 00:14:24,549
The illusion I had planned will pale
in comparison to Riley's,

170
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:29,467
so instead I'd like to repeat
what you just witnessed,

171
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,448
and turn it up a notch.

172
00:14:33,963 --> 00:14:37,962
- Howie, you can't do this.
- It's the ultimate challenge,

173
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:43,034
performing another magician's trick
with no preparation, no rehearsal,

174
00:14:43,351 --> 00:14:44,944
and the same props.

175
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:48,498
Howie, you don't understand.
It's Jane... she...

176
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,993
- She knows the trick!
- I have Marcia.

177
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:56,549
No, but Marcia, she...
Look, please Howie, you can't do this.

178
00:14:57,321 --> 00:15:00,419
Look, he cannot do this trick.

179
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:05,483
Each entrant is entitled to perform the
illusion of their choosing, Mr. Jensen.

180
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:08,639
But you don't understand,
he'll kill her!

181
00:15:14,904 --> 00:15:16,717
No!

182
00:15:34,073 --> 00:15:36,997
Bravo!
Well done!

183
00:16:11,254 --> 00:16:13,175
You walked out on me.

184
00:16:14,095 --> 00:16:18,331
After I put on the star spangled
tap dancing costume...

185
00:16:18,366 --> 00:16:21,518
and let you shoot me in the gut.
I think I held up my end of the bargain.

186
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:23,880
- So, you didn't see what happened?
- What was there to see?

187
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:28,166
- You won, Howie lost, case closed.
- No. Howie won.

188
00:16:29,464 --> 00:16:31,206
But how is that possible?

189
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:37,302
Because he did the same trick.
With my gun and with a normal assistant!

190
00:16:40,288 --> 00:16:43,547
I was talking about Marcia.
You know what I mean.

191
00:16:43,728 --> 00:16:47,624
- But that's impossible.
- Yeah? Not, no, for a Neuro it isn't!

192
00:16:47,735 --> 00:16:49,762
Ri, you've got to let this go.

193
00:16:51,242 --> 00:16:52,872
Yeah, what if I get a DNA results?

194
00:16:53,316 --> 00:16:55,214
- Would that finally convince you?
- I'm serious.

195
00:16:55,301 --> 00:16:58,042
You're going to get yourself in trouble
if you keep obsessing about this guy.

196
00:16:58,201 --> 00:16:59,566
All right, fine.

197
00:17:00,174 --> 00:17:02,161
I won't ask for your help any more.

198
00:17:03,072 --> 00:17:04,875
Riley...

199
00:17:06,336 --> 00:17:08,158
My end of the deal.

200
00:17:09,854 --> 00:17:11,936
I got into Seth's computer.

201
00:17:12,247 --> 00:17:14,635
You were right. He has
the results of your tests.

202
00:17:14,723 --> 00:17:16,434
And are you going to share?

203
00:17:17,285 --> 00:17:20,946
You can take a look yourself. It was
written in doctor-ese mumbo jumbo.

204
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:22,819
I have no idea what it means.

205
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,174
Then I guess I'm gonna have
to ask someone who does.

206
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,593
- You lied to me.
- I'm sorry?

207
00:17:42,716 --> 00:17:44,130
You lied to me.

208
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:46,561
- About what?
- My test results.

209
00:17:46,784 --> 00:17:48,615
You told me you didn't have them yet.

210
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,722
Did you break into my files?

211
00:17:51,379 --> 00:17:52,881
Is that bad?

212
00:17:53,418 --> 00:17:54,635
Do you think I can't handle it?

213
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:58,630
Jane, the results aren't bad at all.
They're just surprising.

214
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:01,557
- Andre thought...
- You talked to Andre?

215
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:05,480
Yes, he agreed that I should
recheck my procedures...

216
00:18:05,535 --> 00:18:07,898
and look for any possible errors
before telling you what I found.

217
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:10,285
- Which is?
- All right,

218
00:18:12,084 --> 00:18:15,345
you remember taking an
IQ test in high school?

219
00:18:15,563 --> 00:18:18,015
Since then, your score has gone up...

220
00:18:18,437 --> 00:18:21,584
by 35 points.

221
00:18:22,077 --> 00:18:24,500
- And?
- Well, that simply doesn't happen.

222
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:26,997
Someone might gain five,
or even ten points at most.

223
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:30,433
But a jump like yours
it's astonishing.

224
00:18:40,194 --> 00:18:42,095
The amazing Jane.

225
00:18:42,115 --> 00:18:44,006
It's hardly bad news.

226
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:50,068
Your spatial processing,
pattern recognition, analytical skills,

227
00:18:50,403 --> 00:18:54,108
short and long-term memory
they've all vastly improved.

228
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,475
- The question is why?
- I'm not sure, but it's...

229
00:18:57,947 --> 00:18:59,800
possibly related to your healing.

230
00:19:00,468 --> 00:19:04,534
You see, in a normal brain, neurons
are forming new connections all the time,

231
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:06,182
but most of those die off...

232
00:19:06,203 --> 00:19:09,269
unless they're reinforced through
practice and repetition but yours...

233
00:19:10,476 --> 00:19:14,080
yours seem to survive.
Can't believe you broke into my files.

234
00:19:14,264 --> 00:19:16,144
So what happens now? I just...

235
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:19,478
keep getting smarter until,
what, my brain explodes?

236
00:19:19,551 --> 00:19:20,798
I wish I could tell you but...

237
00:19:21,773 --> 00:19:23,908
this is uncharted territory
for both of us.

238
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,757
But I think the chances
of cranial detonation are low.

239
00:19:30,562 --> 00:19:34,243
Thanks.
That's reassuring.

240
00:19:38,266 --> 00:19:39,941
No problem.

241
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,188
Now, I'll just reset my password.

242
00:19:51,164 --> 00:19:54,832
A toast to the newest member
of the Magician's Palace.

243
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,428
- Congratulations.
Thank you.

244
00:20:02,214 --> 00:20:04,222
I really appreciate you coming tonight.

245
00:20:05,214 --> 00:20:07,062
I know I haven't exactly
been a gracious loser,

246
00:20:07,145 --> 00:20:09,575
but I'm telling you, the trick you
did last night was mind-blowing.

247
00:20:09,693 --> 00:20:12,690
Come on, Riley, you can drop the act.

248
00:20:13,385 --> 00:20:14,192
What do you mean?

249
00:20:14,242 --> 00:20:18,245
You know exactly how I did the trick with
the gun, because you did it the same way.

250
00:20:19,536 --> 00:20:21,904
You got to wonder how many of us
there really are out there.

251
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:23,640
How many of us... what?

252
00:20:24,148 --> 00:20:25,678
Real magicians.

253
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,636
People who don't need
gimmicks or slight of hand...

254
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:30,081
People who can truly perform magic.

255
00:20:31,283 --> 00:20:34,056
Right.
Right, true magic, yeah.

256
00:20:34,277 --> 00:20:36,376
I mean, I didn't want to be
the first person to say it.

257
00:20:36,494 --> 00:20:38,136
You know how
some people are.

258
00:20:38,984 --> 00:20:41,808
- I thought I was the only one.
- No, no, no, no. There's...

259
00:20:41,843 --> 00:20:43,805
Well, me and my dad.

260
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,361
When did you first know
that you were... special?

261
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:49,146
After I inherited my dad's wand.

262
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,905
I'd been studying magic all my life but...

263
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,353
I only got good enough to do
birthday parties or amateur nights,

264
00:20:54,593 --> 00:20:57,208
but I was just doing the same
fake tricks as everybody else.

265
00:20:57,294 --> 00:21:02,077
But after I got the wand,
it's like the conduit of real magic,

266
00:21:02,183 --> 00:21:03,150
Everything changed.

267
00:21:03,185 --> 00:21:06,847
You should've seen my face when that first
rabbit actually materialized in that hat.

268
00:21:07,104 --> 00:21:09,325
- That must have been something.
- Yeah. So, what about you?

269
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:12,205
When did you first, you know,
achieved your gift?

270
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:14,261
My gift, yeah.

271
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,675
- Could I get some more...
- Oh, god!

272
00:21:17,865 --> 00:21:19,686
- Spilt my water... I'm sorry.
- Everything all right?

273
00:21:19,687 --> 00:21:20,887
Fine.

274
00:21:21,433 --> 00:21:24,112
- We'll clean it up right away.
- That would be great.

275
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:26,847
- Are you okay?
- Did I get you?

276
00:21:26,942 --> 00:21:28,134
Don't worry about it, it's okay.

277
00:21:28,327 --> 00:21:30,138
I'm sorry. I'm just...

278
00:21:30,346 --> 00:21:31,413
No, it's okay.

279
00:21:32,671 --> 00:21:34,544
What were you saying?

280
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,331
What was I saying?

281
00:21:36,682 --> 00:21:38,421
- Oh, about my gift.
- Yeah.

282
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:41,529
Yeah. Well, I was walking in town,

283
00:21:43,272 --> 00:21:47,067
Chinatown actually, I was in Chinatown.
And there was this little store,

284
00:21:47,689 --> 00:21:51,170
This little store, and I went inside
and there was this statue,

285
00:21:51,495 --> 00:21:53,323
a Buddhist statue.

286
00:21:53,548 --> 00:21:55,656
And the owner, he didn't
want to sell it to me, right?

287
00:21:55,862 --> 00:21:59,164
But there was something about it.
I just felt like it was meant for me.

288
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,193
You know what that feeling is like, right?

289
00:22:02,271 --> 00:22:05,173
- I did not really know.
- Not really know.

290
00:22:05,433 --> 00:22:08,609
Well, anyway, one thing led to another,
I convinced him to sell it to me.

291
00:22:08,652 --> 00:22:10,437
Buda-bing, buda-boom,
that was that.

292
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:12,275
Gift.

293
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:15,317
- Did you switch cups?
- What? No.

294
00:22:15,818 --> 00:22:16,737
No.

295
00:22:16,777 --> 00:22:18,869
- Are you trying to drug me?
- No, of course not.

296
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,820
I am not trying to drug you.

297
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,448
You're after my wand.

298
00:22:23,636 --> 00:22:24,461
No. I'm not after...

299
00:22:24,486 --> 00:22:26,596
I thought you were a kindred spirit, Riley.

300
00:22:26,761 --> 00:22:29,418
- I thought I could trust you.
- No, but you can trust me.

301
00:22:29,566 --> 00:22:31,237
Ok, I don't want your wand!

302
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:32,746
The truth is I work with some people...

303
00:22:32,837 --> 00:22:35,254
that might be able to figure
what's really happening to you.

304
00:22:35,642 --> 00:22:37,702
I know exactly what's
happening to you.

305
00:22:42,608 --> 00:22:44,084
Howie?!

306
00:23:01,736 --> 00:23:03,217
Howie?!

307
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,205
Howie?!

308
00:23:09,182 --> 00:23:11,617
Ahhhh!

309
00:23:20,046 --> 00:23:21,486
Howie!

310
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:52,151
Howie!

311
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,971
Howie!

312
00:24:05,783 --> 00:24:09,261
Seth, I need you to run a DNA sample.

313
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:10,673
On what?

314
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:12,945
You'll see here.

315
00:24:14,206 --> 00:24:16,130
- Egg shells?
- Yeah.

316
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:18,830
You've encountered the first
Neuro chicken, have you?

317
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,514
Cute.

318
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,760
These came out of Howie Morris' mouth.

319
00:24:22,885 --> 00:24:26,653
So, basically all you need to do is get
a saliva sample and run the test. Right?

320
00:24:27,264 --> 00:24:30,357
- Well, theoretically.
Ok, then let's do it.

321
00:24:30,616 --> 00:24:34,438
Riley, I can't do anything without
Andre's authorization.

322
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:36,569
Give me a break, Andre?
We don't need to let him know.

323
00:24:36,644 --> 00:24:38,896
I mean, we just run the DNA tests
and that's it.

324
00:24:39,867 --> 00:24:41,345
Sorry.

325
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:50,796
Do you... Do you want to take
your magic egg shells with you?

326
00:24:53,699 --> 00:24:55,711
...one of my team members
has the right to follow hunches...

327
00:24:56,049 --> 00:24:58,989
The right to follow their intuition, but
when we are working on a single case,

328
00:24:59,024 --> 00:25:01,052
Riley, I need you to keep
your head in the game.

329
00:25:01,107 --> 00:25:03,463
You want to follow this up?
Do it at home!

330
00:25:03,991 --> 00:25:05,024
Hey!

331
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:08,878
- He's still on the magician thing?
- Yeah.

332
00:25:09,069 --> 00:25:11,918
Now he wants a DNA test on an eggshell.

333
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:14,503
- Why not let him have it?
- Why, you think he's onto something?

334
00:25:14,595 --> 00:25:15,771
No. But you know Riley.

335
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:19,423
He's not going to let this go until
he gets proof, one way or the other.

336
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,427
We have confirmed cases,
they take priority.

337
00:25:21,488 --> 00:25:24,345
Yes, we need Riley on
those confirmed cases.

338
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:28,261
And while he's got his head wrapped up
in this, he'll be so distracted that...

339
00:25:28,356 --> 00:25:30,914
He's a professional,
he'll have to get over it.

340
00:25:31,231 --> 00:25:32,460
- I agree.
- Good.

341
00:25:32,495 --> 00:25:36,049
That's why I'm saying, why not
show him the results from the DNA test,

342
00:25:36,157 --> 00:25:39,511
and when they come back negative,
we can get back to business as usual.

343
00:25:39,535 --> 00:25:42,944
- Waste our resources to humor Riley.
- it's a favor for a friend.

344
00:25:42,995 --> 00:25:45,437
And before you argue with
me, let me remind you...

345
00:25:45,618 --> 00:25:48,674
that new and improved
IQ number in my file?

346
00:25:49,817 --> 00:25:51,509
It's higher than yours.

347
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:58,832
Who's there?

348
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:00,309
It's Riley.

349
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,537
What do you want?

350
00:26:09,871 --> 00:26:12,221
Listen, Howie, I just want to explain
what happened at the restaurant.

351
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:14,377
Ok? It's not what you thought.

352
00:26:15,459 --> 00:26:17,099
You wanna come in?

353
00:26:17,802 --> 00:26:19,217
Thanks.

354
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:21,986
Riley be gone!

355
00:26:31,606 --> 00:26:33,144
Why don't you go over
his place and look around?

356
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:36,213
I've already been there. The lunatic's
probably off on his Neuro hunt.

357
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,464
Actually, that lunatic might be
in a bit of trouble.

358
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,005
Those eggshells tested Neuro positive.

359
00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:48,726
It's clear.

360
00:26:57,256 --> 00:26:58,667
No sign that he's been here.

361
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,250
You gotta wonder what this
Howie guy could've done to him.

362
00:27:01,869 --> 00:27:05,052
For all we know he could be levitated
over the East river by now.

363
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:06,893
I'm glad you find this amusing.

364
00:27:07,329 --> 00:27:09,944
- He is a Neuro!
- I know, but, c'mon!

365
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,347
What's the guy gonna do?
Pull a rabbit out of his hat?

366
00:27:12,471 --> 00:27:15,025
We still got to find him.
And Riley too.

367
00:27:40,516 --> 00:27:42,313
Howie, what have you...?

368
00:27:51,731 --> 00:27:54,202
- Where are we?
- The Magician's Palace.

369
00:27:54,283 --> 00:27:56,465
If you're thinking of calling
for help, don't bother.

370
00:27:56,851 --> 00:27:58,292
This whole wing is being renovated.

371
00:27:58,339 --> 00:28:01,050
- What did you do to me?
- The disappearing sack trick.

372
00:28:01,325 --> 00:28:03,652
I wish you could have seen it.
It was very impressive.

373
00:28:03,894 --> 00:28:05,095
What did it feel like?

374
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:07,592
Why don't you try it on
yourself and find out?

375
00:28:09,351 --> 00:28:10,658
You know, I didn't want it
to come to this.

376
00:28:11,511 --> 00:28:13,324
But you didn't give me
much of a choice.

377
00:28:13,537 --> 00:28:16,586
Lying to me,
trying to steal my wand.

378
00:28:16,672 --> 00:28:18,396
And who are these
"people you work for?"

379
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:20,758
Government? Military?

380
00:28:20,814 --> 00:28:23,491
People who want to use my gift
for their own nefarious purposes?

381
00:28:23,584 --> 00:28:24,624
It's not like that.

382
00:28:24,816 --> 00:28:26,220
I know why you're
doing this, Riley.

383
00:28:26,312 --> 00:28:29,089
Is because you're jealous.
Because I'm the real McCoy.

384
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:32,841
You're not the real McCoy, Howie,
you're not a magician. You're cheating.

385
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:35,341
- Cheating?
- Illusions take time and skill...

386
00:28:35,476 --> 00:28:38,145
years of practice.
Your "gift" just fell in your lap.

387
00:28:38,239 --> 00:28:40,126
Hey, I earned this.

388
00:28:40,213 --> 00:28:43,281
I spent my entire life proving myself
worthy of my father's legacy.

389
00:28:43,338 --> 00:28:45,052
This wand is my reward.

390
00:28:45,113 --> 00:28:47,044
Enough with the wand, it's a stick.

391
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:49,488
And it has nothing to do
with your ability.

392
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:54,609
What would you know about it?

393
00:28:55,827 --> 00:28:57,123
You're what we call a Neuro.

394
00:28:57,222 --> 00:29:00,320
You have a genetic mutation and
that's what gives you your power.

395
00:29:02,416 --> 00:29:04,840
- That's absurd!
- It's what my team does.

396
00:29:04,901 --> 00:29:06,302
We track down Neuros.

397
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:08,885
Some can control people's
minds, start fires...

398
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,723
bring back the dead.
You, you can do magic.

399
00:29:11,873 --> 00:29:14,344
- You're delusional.
- It's in your mind, Howie.

400
00:29:14,423 --> 00:29:17,167
Your father's wand just gives
you the confidence that you need.

401
00:29:17,211 --> 00:29:18,609
No!

402
00:29:29,466 --> 00:29:32,221
Your magic,
when did it begin?

403
00:29:34,423 --> 00:29:36,094
After my dad died,

404
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:40,463
I didn't have the heart
to perform for a while.

405
00:29:40,506 --> 00:29:43,912
When I started again, I decided to use
his wand in my act as a kind of a...

406
00:29:44,147 --> 00:29:45,474
as a tribute.

407
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,033
Nothing special happened,
not for weeks.

408
00:29:48,342 --> 00:29:50,525
When that rabbit
first appeared in the hat,

409
00:29:52,393 --> 00:29:54,757
I hadn't changed anything.
I didn't do anything different,

410
00:29:54,828 --> 00:29:56,851
I didn't even eat a decent breakfast.

411
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,814
So you thought of the wand.

412
00:30:00,294 --> 00:30:01,591
I would have done the same.

413
00:30:01,683 --> 00:30:03,785
I thought maybe it didn't work at first
because...

414
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,208
I was out of practice,
or I wasn't good enough.

415
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,898
And when the real magic came,
I thought maybe it was...

416
00:30:09,733 --> 00:30:13,441
a final gift from my father,
to show that I deserved it.

417
00:30:15,813 --> 00:30:18,017
Now you're telling me that's not true?

418
00:30:18,569 --> 00:30:20,821
That the only thing
my father left me was...

419
00:30:21,356 --> 00:30:23,119
an old stick with chipped paint.

420
00:30:23,282 --> 00:30:26,850
And that if it wasn't for some
random mutation, I'd still be...

421
00:30:26,885 --> 00:30:30,043
a marginally talented hack pulling a
quarter out of nine years old's ear.

422
00:30:30,133 --> 00:30:31,651
That's what you're telling me?

423
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:36,598
Yeah. Pretty much.

424
00:30:39,325 --> 00:30:42,810
Okay, I've got Howie's
recent credit card activity.

425
00:30:42,996 --> 00:30:47,991
Mostly online purchases of
books and magic supplies.

426
00:30:48,016 --> 00:30:50,737
- Several charges for pizza delivery.
- What a life!

427
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,929
- Plane tickets? Car rentals? Hotel rooms?
- No.

428
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:57,851
Come on, what would genius boy
do to find himself? Think!

429
00:30:59,744 --> 00:31:02,942
Wait! Try checking traffic cameras
near Howie's apartment.

430
00:31:03,065 --> 00:31:04,853
That's a great idea.

431
00:31:06,427 --> 00:31:07,872
I have no clue how to do that.

432
00:31:07,928 --> 00:31:10,399
Come on! Even with that
oversized IQ of yours?

433
00:31:13,156 --> 00:31:14,956
Since none of you guys
were taking me seriously,

434
00:31:15,018 --> 00:31:17,017
I had to take matters
into my own hands.

435
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:20,925
If you're watching this, it means I've been
missing now for about twelve hours.

436
00:31:21,036 --> 00:31:24,100
If I were sitting there, with you guys,
which I'm obviously not,

437
00:31:24,271 --> 00:31:25,969
I might be able to help you. So...

438
00:31:26,187 --> 00:31:27,692
He's thorough.
You gotta give him that.

439
00:31:27,723 --> 00:31:29,452
I've hooked up my heat
signature to the database...

440
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:31,366
and linked into N.S.A.'s satellites.

441
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:36,225
The red dot you see should indicate
where my location is.

442
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:38,526
Hopefully one of you guys
can read a map...

443
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:41,996
and I'm not at the bottom of a river
somewhere by the time you get to get this.

444
00:31:42,054 --> 00:31:44,769
So come find me.

445
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,070
Where is that?

446
00:31:46,087 --> 00:31:49,458
I’d say it's way at the end
of Old Post road.

447
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,410
Let's rock and roll.

448
00:31:55,007 --> 00:31:59,824
Maybe you're right. Maybe my abilities
did come from some... mutant gene.

449
00:31:59,975 --> 00:32:03,396
The thing I'm realizing, Riley is...
it doesn't matter.

450
00:32:03,557 --> 00:32:06,305
It doesn't matter?
Of course it matters.

451
00:32:06,447 --> 00:32:07,383
Why?

452
00:32:07,403 --> 00:32:10,985
- Because you'll know the truth.
- But magic is all about hiding the truth.

453
00:32:11,732 --> 00:32:15,251
- Using an illusion to complete the trick.
- Your life isn't a trick, Howie.

454
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,722
If you have a genetic anomaly,
it needs to be dealt with.

455
00:32:18,857 --> 00:32:20,487
Dealt with?
What do you mean?

456
00:32:23,234 --> 00:32:27,189
Riley, how would you like to spend
the rest of your life in a rabbit cage?

457
00:32:27,287 --> 00:32:29,881
- We can chip you!
- Chip me?

458
00:32:29,979 --> 00:32:32,687
It's a small chip that
emits an electrical charge.

459
00:32:36,283 --> 00:32:39,081
- That puts an end to my magic?
- It's not magic, Howie.

460
00:32:39,105 --> 00:32:42,433
My whole life, I grew up watching
my father bring a sense of...

461
00:32:42,568 --> 00:32:44,871
mystery and wonder to people's lives.

462
00:32:46,383 --> 00:32:48,376
Finally, I can do the same.

463
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:56,249
I don't understand you
or your team, Riley.

464
00:32:56,323 --> 00:33:00,188
Why would you want to "chip"
somebody like me? I'm not dangerous.

465
00:33:00,256 --> 00:33:01,740
It's not what we want.

466
00:33:01,864 --> 00:33:05,740
It's just over time we've realized that
every Neuro is potentially dangerous.

467
00:33:05,761 --> 00:33:07,070
Why?
Because I'm different?

468
00:33:07,134 --> 00:33:09,007
Because I can do things
that most people can't?

469
00:33:09,132 --> 00:33:11,309
The same about
Einstein or Hawking.

470
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:13,263
And what about Mozart?

471
00:33:14,638 --> 00:33:17,085
He was composing when he was four.
You gonna chip him too?

472
00:33:17,179 --> 00:33:19,438
Somehow, I doubt that Mozart was a Neuro.

473
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,070
What if he was?

474
00:33:30,455 --> 00:33:32,206
You know what your problem is, Riley?

475
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,497
- I'm still tied to a chair?
- You're scared.

476
00:33:34,589 --> 00:33:35,959
Scared? Scared of what?

477
00:33:35,994 --> 00:33:38,348
Anything. Anything you don't understand.

478
00:33:39,303 --> 00:33:43,136
Instead of enjoying the ride, you try
to figure it out and make it all logical.

479
00:33:43,218 --> 00:33:44,062
Of course.

480
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:45,864
It's probably why you love
your computers so much.

481
00:33:45,955 --> 00:33:48,499
- They're reliable.
- Is that all that matters in life?

482
00:33:49,491 --> 00:33:50,758
Reliable?

483
00:33:55,883 --> 00:33:57,915
What about the joy of mystery?

484
00:33:59,242 --> 00:34:00,612
Love?

485
00:34:00,689 --> 00:34:04,177
Don't you remember the first time
you saw someone turn a tiger...

486
00:34:04,212 --> 00:34:06,386
into a beautiful woman
in the blink of an eye?

487
00:34:06,807 --> 00:34:10,451
Before you started calculating it
and explaining it all to yourself?

488
00:34:11,307 --> 00:34:13,817
Wasn't there a moment
where your jaw dropped...

489
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,531
and your heart stuck in your throat
and all you could think of was...

490
00:34:18,011 --> 00:34:19,246
Wow.

491
00:34:21,252 --> 00:34:23,112
You want to take that away?

492
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,609
From children?
From adults? From yourself?

493
00:34:29,392 --> 00:34:31,970
- My heat signature!
- Excuse me?

494
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:35,838
Howie, you nee to go.
You need to get out of here.

495
00:34:36,092 --> 00:34:38,382
- Why?
- My teammates, they'll be coming.

496
00:34:38,555 --> 00:34:41,538
I gave them a way to find me.
You have to go now!

497
00:34:46,705 --> 00:34:49,481
- Conner, wait...!
- Ahhh!

498
00:34:49,862 --> 00:34:51,411
You can't hold me.

499
00:34:52,498 --> 00:34:54,168
Into thin air!

500
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:56,989
Into thin air!

501
00:34:58,933 --> 00:35:01,446
Into thin air!
No!

502
00:35:01,581 --> 00:35:02,817
Yes!

503
00:35:04,696 --> 00:35:06,364
Riley,

504
00:35:07,335 --> 00:35:11,590
- ...you okay?
- Yeah. Great.

505
00:35:22,846 --> 00:35:24,746
- We made a mistake!
- Yes.

506
00:35:24,865 --> 00:35:28,043
I was just about to say that we should
have trusted your instincts more. Good job.

507
00:35:28,064 --> 00:35:29,563
Howie is not a threat.

508
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:31,380
Ok? We should de-chip
him and let him go.

509
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,450
De-chip?
Is that possible?

510
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:35,847
The doctors at NICO have
done some surgeries.

511
00:35:35,961 --> 00:35:38,214
It's not conclusive but they're
suggesting it's possible.

512
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,654
There's a step backward
for the world.

513
00:35:40,677 --> 00:35:43,170
- And why would they want to do this?
- I don't know. It's not my department.

514
00:35:43,278 --> 00:35:45,583
If anyone deserves to be de-chipped
it should be Howie.

515
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:47,737
He's harmless. He just wants
to make people happy.

516
00:35:47,883 --> 00:35:50,890
He's a Neuro, Riley. The path to
hell is paved with good intentions.

517
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:53,786
Howie's only on the path
to the Magician's Palace.

518
00:35:53,834 --> 00:35:56,292
Sorry, we can't take the risk.

519
00:35:57,108 --> 00:35:59,100
Then you better chip me, too.

520
00:36:00,165 --> 00:36:02,026
What are you doing?!

521
00:36:02,562 --> 00:36:05,985
You see, you can take the risk.

522
00:36:06,018 --> 00:36:07,875
There's always a choice.

523
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:11,637
But then, you might need me
to save your asses. Again.

524
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:14,083
- That's not funny.
- The debate is over.

525
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:17,515
Howie is chipped and he goes to NICO.
Connor.

526
00:36:25,368 --> 00:36:26,646
Thanks for trying.

527
00:36:26,764 --> 00:36:28,904
Is there any way you could
de-chip him on your own?

528
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,356
No. Seth would have to operate, and...

529
00:36:31,509 --> 00:36:34,160
you know Seth.
Without Andre's authorization...

530
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,072
What?

531
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,658
When I first joined the team, Seth and I
we ran some tests on the Neuro chip,

532
00:36:44,781 --> 00:36:46,882
to find out if anything might
disrupt its function.

533
00:36:47,198 --> 00:36:48,213
- And?
- If I can create...

534
00:36:48,243 --> 00:36:51,136
- ...a strong enough electromagnetic field.
- Can you do that?

535
00:36:51,322 --> 00:36:52,812
If anyone can...

536
00:36:53,598 --> 00:36:55,356
This is your deal, Riley.

537
00:36:56,533 --> 00:36:58,168
You're on your own.

538
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:16,121
- You got a pick up for us?
- Yeah.

539
00:37:23,985 --> 00:37:25,977
- When did this happen?
- Last month.

540
00:37:26,064 --> 00:37:27,366
They upgraded everything.

541
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:30,156
They've already been chipped,
they don't pose any threat.

542
00:37:30,266 --> 00:37:32,827
I don't make the orders.
I drive the freaks.

543
00:37:34,573 --> 00:37:35,961
Where is it?

544
00:37:38,964 --> 00:37:40,456
What do you want?

545
00:37:40,739 --> 00:37:43,824
Look, I've got to get you out of here.

546
00:37:44,426 --> 00:37:45,871
Why bother?

547
00:37:46,601 --> 00:37:48,755
You've taken away the one thing
from me that ever truly mattered.

548
00:37:48,784 --> 00:37:52,008
You think I could ever go back
to a normal, boring, life?

549
00:37:52,526 --> 00:37:53,888
It's not that bad, is it?

550
00:37:53,937 --> 00:37:56,557
Only by comparison to a world
filled with magic.

551
00:37:59,342 --> 00:38:01,351
I think I can disable your chip.

552
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:03,468
What?

553
00:38:04,337 --> 00:38:05,615
Just get ready.

554
00:38:09,772 --> 00:38:11,197
For what?

555
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:26,402
Trust me.

556
00:38:40,143 --> 00:38:41,356
Howie!

557
00:38:41,433 --> 00:38:43,502
Howie!
Howie!

558
00:38:45,112 --> 00:38:46,521
Are you okay?

559
00:38:46,768 --> 00:38:48,462
You've electrocuted me?

560
00:38:48,787 --> 00:38:50,249
We don't have much time.

561
00:38:50,385 --> 00:38:51,829
Try your magic.

562
00:38:52,105 --> 00:38:53,498
Try to disappear.

563
00:38:53,546 --> 00:38:55,970
- It's no use.
- No, you want to try!

564
00:38:56,346 --> 00:38:57,594
Please,

565
00:38:58,796 --> 00:39:00,569
try it.

566
00:39:00,742 --> 00:39:02,145
Come on.

567
00:39:03,019 --> 00:39:04,852
I will vanish...

568
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,215
Now!

569
00:39:11,066 --> 00:39:12,569
You need to concentrate.

570
00:39:12,652 --> 00:39:13,381
Okay?

571
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,025
Look, just pretend like I'm the audience.

572
00:39:17,176 --> 00:39:18,863
Ok, Howie, amaze me.

573
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,251
Amaze me!

574
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:24,106
Come on, Howie!

575
00:39:36,131 --> 00:39:37,713
I can't.

576
00:39:38,267 --> 00:39:40,120
The chip's still working.

577
00:39:40,406 --> 00:39:42,163
The jolt that I gave you has got to work.

578
00:39:42,256 --> 00:39:44,259
I'm telling you I can't!

579
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,590
- I've got to get you out of here.
- Don't, don't!

580
00:39:58,438 --> 00:40:01,305
- I'm willing to accept my fate.
- Yeah, well, I'm not.

581
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:03,915
Come on!

582
00:40:34,161 --> 00:40:37,083
- What is this place?
- Someplace I have to get you out of.

583
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:52,462
What the hell happened here?

584
00:40:54,563 --> 00:40:56,049
What do you know about this?

585
00:40:56,497 --> 00:40:57,721
I don't.

586
00:40:57,795 --> 00:40:59,452
And where the hell is Riley?

587
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:17,688
Come on, Howie!
We have to hurry!

588
00:41:19,578 --> 00:41:22,673
Howie, you need to try it,
try it again!

589
00:41:22,832 --> 00:41:25,427
- Riley, I told you that...
- Howie, we're running out of time!

590
00:41:25,562 --> 00:41:26,792
Take this.

591
00:41:28,985 --> 00:41:31,030
Just try again for your dad.

592
00:41:33,834 --> 00:41:35,301
Come on.

593
00:41:44,499 --> 00:41:49,085
The amazing Howie will now...
be gone!

594
00:41:54,223 --> 00:41:55,705
Riley.

595
00:41:58,239 --> 00:41:59,653
Hey, boss.

596
00:42:02,438 --> 00:42:03,711
Beautiful day, huh?

597
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,468
Where's Morris?

598
00:42:06,034 --> 00:42:07,870
Howie? Isn't he in his cell?

599
00:42:08,003 --> 00:42:10,102
You know damn well
he's not in his cell!

600
00:42:10,221 --> 00:42:11,628
No, I have no idea.

601
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,438
How does a chipped Neuro get out of
his cell without setting off security?

602
00:42:19,465 --> 00:42:21,005
Magic?

603
00:42:22,015 --> 00:42:23,565
Magic.

604
00:42:45,232 --> 00:42:48,724
It always amazed me how Riley was
able to pull a rabbit out of his hat...

605
00:42:48,748 --> 00:42:50,796
when it came to computer information,

606
00:42:51,209 --> 00:42:53,927
I never dreamed he was able
to do it literally as well.

607
00:42:54,145 --> 00:42:56,060
In the end Howie was right,

608
00:42:56,178 --> 00:43:00,149
it didn't matter to the non-magicians
in his audience how he did his tricks.

609
00:43:00,192 --> 00:43:03,261
They were there to be entertained
and amused.

610
