00:00:00,763 --> 00:00:02,197
My name is Jane Vasco

2
00:00:02,277 --> 00:00:03,618
I could use you on my team.

3
00:00:03,688 --> 00:00:07,179
I work for a secret government
agency that hunts neuros.

4
00:00:07,295 --> 00:00:11,214
People who can do dangerous
things with their minds.

5
00:00:11,399 --> 00:00:12,806
On my first assignment...

6
00:00:12,894 --> 00:00:15,091
Something a little weird happened,

7
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:18,467
okay, something really weird.

8
00:00:18,594 --> 00:00:21,611
Until I get some answers
I'm getting on with my life,

9
00:00:21,819 --> 00:00:23,412
doing my job.

10
00:00:23,487 --> 00:00:25,516
Stocking up on aspirin,

11
00:00:25,563 --> 00:00:28,638
because let me tell ya,

12
00:00:28,707 --> 00:00:30,507

13
00:00:44,812 --> 00:00:46,303
... with the high today expected

14
00:00:46,361 --> 00:00:47,956
to be in the low 70's.

15
00:00:48,118 --> 00:00:49,364
As for the rest of the week,

16
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:51,747
expect a chance of rain on saturday.

17
00:00:52,058 --> 00:00:56,150
Alright, it's 6:30 a.m. And
time for the traffic report.

18
00:00:56,243 --> 00:00:57,653
Light for a thursday morning...

19
00:00:57,723 --> 00:01:00,600
But expect some congestion
downtown due to the arrival

20
00:01:00,658 --> 00:01:03,597
of visiting chinese
minister of foreign affairs,

21
00:01:03,675 --> 00:01:04,675
zhang quan...

22
00:01:04,707 --> 00:01:08,175
who wants here to discuss the growing
number of food import restriction

23
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:10,672
 between the US and China.

24
00:01:10,724 --> 00:01:13,140
In other news, the city....

25
00:01:16,084 --> 00:01:17,298
Good morning...

26
00:01:17,483 --> 00:01:20,414
Is everything set for today, Phillip?

27
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,192
You know how important this is.

28
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:25,062
Don't worry.

29
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,687
Everything will go as planned.

30
00:01:50,168 --> 00:01:51,671
Got a lead on our neuro.

31
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:53,104
Briefing at 7:00.

32
00:01:53,162 --> 00:01:54,950
Call connor and riley.

33
00:01:55,871 --> 00:01:57,189
Wrong number?

34
00:01:57,431 --> 00:01:58,849
I wish.

35
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:08,458
King, connor king.

36
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,093
Guess we're not running this morning.

37
00:02:12,695 --> 00:02:13,920
You guess right.

38
00:02:14,373 --> 00:02:15,373
Sorry.

39
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,568
It's your ass for not picking up,

40
00:02:20,754 --> 00:02:23,575
andre called, got a lead on that neuro.

41
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,174
There's a briefing, now.

42
00:02:34,657 --> 00:02:35,657
Riley's on his way.

43
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,697
Couldn't get hold of connor.

44
00:02:36,765 --> 00:02:37,628
That's okay, I did.

45
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:38,576
He'll be here.

46
00:02:38,696 --> 00:02:39,828
What's going on?

47
00:02:39,898 --> 00:02:42,857
Seth confirmed that phil dyle's
dna is neuro-positive.

48
00:02:43,031 --> 00:02:45,609
Morgan believes he's tied in
with some political extremists.

49
00:02:45,678 --> 00:02:47,066
We figure out what his power is?

50
00:02:47,112 --> 00:02:49,378
Nope, we're just gonna have to wing it.

51
00:02:49,493 --> 00:02:50,691
Damn!

52
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:52,684
You alright?

53
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:54,314
Yeah, yeah...

54
00:02:54,395 --> 00:02:57,265
Guess I should've thrown
the circuit breaker.

55
00:02:57,528 --> 00:03:00,110
Dyle rented a top floor office
in a downtown building

56
00:03:00,202 --> 00:03:01,532
the leasing company ran a credit check.

57
00:03:01,566 --> 00:03:03,173
Feds caught it doing routine security.

58
00:03:03,254 --> 00:03:04,480
What do the feds have to do with it?

59
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:06,295
That office building's on
the motorcade route

60
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,831
of the chinese foreign minister
who's visiting the city today.

61
00:03:10,113 --> 00:03:11,130
What happened to you?

62
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,296
Got splashed by a truck.

63
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:18,275
I was distracted.

64
00:03:18,321 --> 00:03:19,411
That's doesn't sound like you.

65
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:20,458
So sue me!

66
00:03:21,344 --> 00:03:23,154
Given dyle's political agenda...

67
00:03:23,216 --> 00:03:24,946
An attack on zhang quan, on U.S. soil

68
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,888
could have disastrous ramifications.

69
00:03:26,934 --> 00:03:27,934
Thanks for coming.

70
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:28,951
Sorry I'm late.

71
00:03:28,963 --> 00:03:31,088
You wouldn't have been if
you answered your phone.

72
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:34,177
I was helping my neighbor
jump-start his car.

73
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,247
Okay, people, let's roll,

74
00:03:35,252 --> 00:03:36,281
we don't have much time.

75
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:36,682
Where?

76
00:03:36,802 --> 00:03:38,559
I'll fill you in on the way.

77
00:03:38,975 --> 00:03:39,809
What happened to him?

78
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:42,207
Don't ask or you'll have to sue him.

79
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,570
) Zhang's motorcade just
got off on exit 41,

80
00:05:24,605 --> 00:05:26,305
turned east on jefferson.

81
00:05:27,246 --> 00:05:29,082
Eta on dyle's location?

82
00:05:29,147 --> 00:05:31,190
Two minutes, 35 seconds.

83
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:50,001
Run it!

84
00:06:04,317 --> 00:06:06,005
Riley, zhang's eta.

85
00:06:06,052 --> 00:06:07,276
Two minutes.

86
00:06:10,705 --> 00:06:12,011
Got a satellite thermal image of someone

87
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:13,380
in the rented office.

88
00:06:13,815 --> 00:06:14,815
Alright,

89
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:16,863
Jane, in there, use the stairs in case.

90
00:06:16,902 --> 00:06:18,000
You take the elevator.

91
00:06:18,104 --> 00:06:19,284
I'll cover the rear.

92
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:41,907

93
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:02,777

94
00:07:05,616 --> 00:07:06,991
What's going on?

95
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,626
Explosion in the staircase.

96
00:07:09,003 --> 00:07:10,237

98
00:07:20,845 --> 00:07:22,791
Getting off the elevator, fourth floor.

99
00:07:23,238 --> 00:07:24,290
Stay on target.

100
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,625
Vasco?

101
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:31,497
Vasco?!

102
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:47,564
She's dead.

103
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:49,021
It's jane.

104
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:50,360
She'll heal.

105
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,160
No.

106
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:54,388

148

to be in the low 70's.

187
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:07,837
As for the rest of the week,

188
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,720
expect a chance of rain on saturday.

189
00:20:10,824 --> 00:20:14,878
Alright, it's 6:30 a.M. And
time for the traffic report.

190
00:20:14,951 --> 00:20:16,863
Light for a thursday morning...

191
00:20:28,335 --> 00:20:29,735
Got a lead on our neuro.

192
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,181
Briefing at 7:00.

193
00:20:31,262 --> 00:20:32,384
Call connor and riley.

194
00:20:40,735 --> 00:20:41,787
Damn it!

195
00:20:43,362 --> 00:20:44,362
Sorry I'm late.

196
00:20:44,888 --> 00:20:47,389
You wouldn't have been if
you answered your phone.

197
00:20:47,478 --> 00:20:50,229
I was helping my neighbor
jump-start his car.

198
00:20:59,747 --> 00:21:00,925
Vasco, you alright?

199
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,760
Yeah, I think.

200
00:21:07,022 --> 00:21:08,710
Alright, let's roll, people.
we don't have much time.

201
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:09,168
Where?

202
00:21:09,288 --> 00:21:10,590
I'll fill you in on the way.

203
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,120
What happened to him?

204
00:21:12,247 --> 00:21:14,392
Don't ask or you'll have to sue him.

205
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,250
Okay, third try.

206
00:21:21,256 --> 00:21:23,048
Parking meter trick didn't
slow them down enough,

207
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:24,994
I gotta find something else to change.

208
00:21:36,404 --> 00:21:39,150
The traffic signal for this
light is 75 seconds.

209
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,145
Why does the damn thing
change for them at 14.

210
00:21:48,131 --> 00:21:50,501
How can they control
the traffic signals?

211
00:21:52,189 --> 00:21:53,189
Unless they're feds.

212
00:22:05,734 --> 00:22:07,682
You have no idea how
you lost the button.

213
00:22:07,724 --> 00:22:09,476
It's a button, darlin'.

214
00:22:09,915 --> 00:22:11,436
If it means that much to you,

215
00:22:11,494 --> 00:22:13,517
you can come over tonight
and sew on another one.

216
00:22:13,552 --> 00:22:14,633
We got a problem guys.

217
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:16,045
What've you got?

218
00:22:16,165 --> 00:22:17,977
Someone just hacked into the dmv system.

219
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,969
Ran a plate on one of our vehicles.

220
00:22:20,243 --> 00:22:21,305
Think dyle's onto us?

221
00:22:21,931 --> 00:22:23,180
How would he know how to find us?

222
00:22:23,226 --> 00:22:24,636
Riley, which plate did they run?

223
00:22:24,706 --> 00:22:25,706
The black tahoe.

224
00:22:26,715 --> 00:22:27,733
I think it is dyle.

225
00:22:27,802 --> 00:22:29,782
Is that woman's intuition?

226
00:22:31,386 --> 00:22:32,386
Humor me.

227
00:22:32,912 --> 00:22:33,912
Right.

228
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,108
So what's the deal with riley?

229
00:23:00,165 --> 00:23:01,271
How'd he get wet?

230
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,783
The truck hit a puddle.

231
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,683
Zhang's motorcade's
approaching exit 41...

232
00:23:29,881 --> 00:23:33,129
Eta to building, 2 minutes, 55 seconds.

233
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:34,959
Hit it.

234
00:24:09,134 --> 00:24:10,134
Run it!!

235
00:24:18,885 --> 00:24:19,891
Watch out!!!

236
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:24,887
Getting a lotta heat
on the thermal image.

237
00:24:24,934 --> 00:24:25,998
What happened?

238
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,116
We're cut off.

239
00:24:32,236 --> 00:24:33,570
Call the fire department.

240
00:24:33,585 --> 00:24:34,821
Zhang's eta?

241
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:37,125
2 minutes, 20 seconds.

242
00:24:37,832 --> 00:24:39,726
We're not getting through this.

243
00:24:42,622 --> 00:24:43,784
Whoa!!

244
00:24:50,112 --> 00:24:51,279
) Vasco's going in alone.

245
00:24:51,869 --> 00:24:53,363
&Riley, zhang's eta...

246
00:24:55,051 --> 00:24:56,183
Minute, ten.

247
00:24:56,218 --> 00:24:57,640
I've got a satellite
thermal image of someone

248
00:24:57,676 --> 00:24:58,765
in the rented office.

249
00:24:59,467 --> 00:25:00,912
Taking the elevator.

250
00:25:10,752 --> 00:25:12,185
Elevator's out.

251
00:25:12,463 --> 00:25:13,764
Jane, take the stairs.

252
00:25:15,343 --> 00:25:17,172
Zhang's 20 seconds
from the intersection.

253
00:25:38,341 --> 00:25:40,158
Got a lead on our neuro.

254
00:26:01,472 --> 00:26:02,477
Come on!

255
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,465
Got a lead on our neuro.

256
00:26:35,947 --> 00:26:36,947
Damn!!

257
00:26:37,078 --> 00:26:38,204
We have a briefing at 7:00

258
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:39,702
call connor and riley.

259
00:27:09,921 --> 00:27:11,447
You're gonna be damn
sorry lady that you ever came

260
00:27:11,493 --> 00:27:12,588
along for this ride.

261
00:27:17,434 --> 00:27:20,316
...With a high today expected
to be in the low 70's.

262
00:27:20,841 --> 00:27:22,170
As for the rest of the week,

263
00:27:22,216 --> 00:27:24,201
expect a chance of rain on saturday.

264
00:27:24,723 --> 00:27:28,609
All right it's 6:30 a.M. And
time for the traffic report.

265
00:27:28,902 --> 00:27:32,397
Light for a thursday but expect
some congestion downtown

266
00:27:32,455 --> 00:27:33,723
due to the arrival of

267
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:36,175
visiting chinese minister
of foreign affairs...

268
00:27:36,226 --> 00:27:37,578
6:30 a.M?

269
00:27:39,322 --> 00:27:40,322
Thursday?

270
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:44,245
I don't understand.

271
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,388
It's not the first time
you've lived this day.

272
00:27:46,508 --> 00:27:47,678
Keep your mouth shut.

273
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:48,962
I've got to take this call.

274
00:27:56,527 --> 00:27:57,165
Hello?

275
00:27:57,285 --> 00:27:59,212
Is everything set for today, phillip?

276
00:28:00,134 --> 00:28:01,290
Mother, please.

277
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:03,197
The job will get done.

278
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:04,484
I told you not to worry.

279
00:28:04,515 --> 00:28:06,476
You know how important this is.

280
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,130
Something's come up
I need to take care of.

281
00:28:13,118 --> 00:28:14,349
I've got it under control.

282
00:28:14,424 --> 00:28:15,938
Try and have some faith in me.

283
00:28:17,303 --> 00:28:18,749
Then I'll see you tonight...

284
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:21,037
To celebrate our victory.

285
00:28:21,072 --> 00:28:22,667
I'll be there for dinner.

286
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:28,733
You always listen to your mother?

287
00:28:28,767 --> 00:28:29,875
Shut up.

288
00:29:01,425 --> 00:29:02,917
André...which one's andre?

289
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:04,605
The older guy or the muscle?

290
00:29:18,076 --> 00:29:20,134
Vasco, where the hell are you?

291
00:29:29,078 --> 00:29:30,121
Who's andre?

292
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,200
Boss

293
00:29:34,026 --> 00:29:34,542
I'll take it.

294
00:29:34,662 --> 00:29:35,016
No.

295
00:29:35,136 --> 00:29:35,571
I'll take it.

296
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:36,691
No.

297
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,023
You have your choice...

298
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:42,447
Him...

299
00:29:43,993 --> 00:29:44,993
...or me?

300
00:29:53,253 --> 00:29:54,810
I gotta take it.

301
00:29:56,051 --> 00:29:57,051
Connor.

302
00:29:57,751 --> 00:29:58,941
Got a lead on our neuro.

303
00:29:58,988 --> 00:30:00,059
Briefing at 7:00.

304
00:30:00,155 --> 00:30:01,820
Any idea where vasco is?

305
00:30:03,197 --> 00:30:04,197
No.

306
00:30:04,538 --> 00:30:05,590
No! No!!

307
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:06,372
Connor!!

308
00:30:06,492 --> 00:30:07,492
No! No!!

309
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,180
Call riley.

310
00:30:09,949 --> 00:30:10,949
Copy that.

311
00:30:13,738 --> 00:30:14,829
I got to go.

312
00:30:18,097 --> 00:30:20,507
So if the day is completely replayed...

313
00:30:20,663 --> 00:30:22,712
How come I rember
everything that happened?

314
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,262
Because you were holding
on to me when I re-racked.

315
00:30:26,385 --> 00:30:27,995
No one else will recall living this day,

316
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:31,222
including your little commando team.

317
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,766
That explains connor's button.

318
00:30:37,663 --> 00:30:38,684
How far back can you go?

319
00:30:39,189 --> 00:30:40,722
The beginning of the current day.

320
00:30:40,842 --> 00:30:42,424
Once a day's over, it's over.

321
00:30:44,102 --> 00:30:46,177
I'm not god.

322
00:30:47,493 --> 00:30:48,539
Just close.

323
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:53,575
My turn.

324
00:30:56,192 --> 00:30:58,145
Who are you people?

325
00:31:00,701 --> 00:31:02,763
Why are you trying to kill zhang quan?

326
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,279
Answering a question with a question.

327
00:31:12,684 --> 00:31:14,385
Guess you're going to die never knowing.

328
00:32:03,928 --> 00:32:04,928
Hey

329
00:32:21,932 --> 00:32:22,970
it's okay.

330
00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:27,222
Straight to voice mail.

331
00:32:27,303 --> 00:32:28,748
Vasco, if nothing's wrong with you,

332
00:32:28,806 --> 00:32:30,106
I'm gonna kill you myself.

333
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:32,632
What happened to you?

334
00:32:32,713 --> 00:32:34,417
Take to long to explain.

335
00:32:34,648 --> 00:32:36,207
I know what dyle's power is.

336
00:32:36,602 --> 00:32:38,278
He can re-rack time.

337
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:40,307
Replay the same day over and over.

338
00:32:41,469 --> 00:32:43,122
That's a pretty wild theory.

339
00:32:43,215 --> 00:32:45,500
You called the briefing to tell
us that dyle rented

340
00:32:45,569 --> 00:32:47,454
a downtown office on the route of

341
00:32:47,524 --> 00:32:49,720
the chinese foreign
minister, zhang quan.

342
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:52,038
You couldn't know that.

343
00:32:52,113 --> 00:32:53,281
Unless you already told me.

344
00:32:53,327 --> 00:32:54,039
Which you did.

345
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,113
The last time we started this day.

346
00:32:56,252 --> 00:32:58,160
Joe's going to short out a wire

347
00:32:58,227 --> 00:32:59,227
and the light's going to blow.

348
00:32:59,267 --> 00:33:00,324
Damn!

349
00:33:02,262 --> 00:33:03,325
I'm alright.

350
00:33:03,522 --> 00:33:05,406
Guess I should've thrown
the circuit breaker.

351
00:33:06,273 --> 00:33:06,846
How did you...

352
00:33:06,966 --> 00:33:09,813
In two seconds, riley's
going to enter soaking wet.

353
00:33:14,623 --> 00:33:16,137
Didn't you get splashed by a truck?

354
00:33:18,542 --> 00:33:20,801
No, but this girl I just met did.

355
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:21,870
Close enough.

356
00:33:22,396 --> 00:33:23,178
How'd you know that?

357
00:33:23,298 --> 00:33:25,738
The last time we lived
this day I called riley.

358
00:33:25,864 --> 00:33:28,136
This time, I didn't get
your call about the briefing

359
00:33:28,223 --> 00:33:29,691
somebody else must've called him.

360
00:33:29,934 --> 00:33:30,934
Yeah, I did.

361
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,274
Everything's just a little off.

362
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,565
Sorry I'm late.

363
00:33:34,862 --> 00:33:36,788
Connor, hold up your right arm.

364
00:33:37,858 --> 00:33:39,421
You got a button missing on your cuff.

365
00:33:39,587 --> 00:33:42,477
Yeah, I just noticed.

366
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,215
The neuro can restart the day.

367
00:33:44,271 --> 00:33:45,774
As many times as he needs to.

368
00:33:45,832 --> 00:33:47,404
We don't remember anything,

369
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:48,560
what's different?

370
00:33:48,629 --> 00:33:50,005
How do you know all this.

371
00:33:50,074 --> 00:33:51,381
What're you talking about?

372
00:33:51,439 --> 00:33:52,456
Long story.

373
00:33:52,502 --> 00:33:53,346
And we've got to get downtown.

374
00:33:53,466 --> 00:33:54,617
Dyle's going to try again.

375
00:33:55,986 --> 00:33:56,986
Connor.

376
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,974
What the heck is going on?

377
00:34:00,818 --> 00:34:01,818
You're asking me.

378
00:34:20,995 --> 00:34:21,684
Be careful...

379
00:34:21,804 --> 00:34:24,475
The whole intersection is
going to erupt in flames.

380
00:34:24,972 --> 00:34:25,972
If you say so.

381
00:34:29,018 --> 00:34:30,018
Run it!!

382
00:34:38,811 --> 00:34:39,811
Flames, huh?

383
00:34:40,483 --> 00:34:42,146
Dyle must've changed something.

384
00:34:49,634 --> 00:34:51,495
Riley, zhang's eta?

385
00:34:54,235 --> 00:34:55,322
Two minutes.

386
00:34:55,784 --> 00:34:57,229
I've got a satellite
thermal image of someone

387
00:34:57,287 --> 00:34:58,287
in the rented office.

388
00:34:58,431 --> 00:34:59,777
He's cut power to the elevator.

389
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:02,246
Stairwell's the only way up
but it's booby-trapped.

390
00:35:02,345 --> 00:35:03,744
I'll take the lead.

391
00:35:19,862 --> 00:35:22,178
Zhang's eta to intersection, 20 seconds.

392
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:26,265
That jack-ass stole my vespa.

393
00:35:27,271 --> 00:35:28,275
Where is he?

394
00:35:28,346 --> 00:35:29,346
I don't know.

395
00:35:35,672 --> 00:35:36,742
Untie me!!

396
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:37,792
Shut up.

397
00:36:42,428 --> 00:36:43,428
Point blank.

398
00:36:44,203 --> 00:36:45,833
Zhang never had a chance.

399
00:36:46,009 --> 00:36:47,009
Yeah.

400
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,308
Gotcha.

401
00:36:53,847 --> 00:36:55,510
One of the networks
acquired cell phone footage

402
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:57,547
of the assassination
taken by a civilian.

403
00:36:57,753 --> 00:36:58,753
They just ran it.

404
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,998
Unfortunately, we got to watch it live.

405
00:37:01,383 --> 00:37:01,783
Great.

406
00:37:01,903 --> 00:37:03,839
Everyone's gonna see our
screw-up over and over again,

407
00:37:03,914 --> 00:37:04,914
all day long.

408
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,697
Homeland security elevated
the threat level to orange.

409
00:37:07,766 --> 00:37:10,506
Dod's put the military
on alert, world-wide.

410
00:37:10,587 --> 00:37:12,613
Even if we hunt this guy
down and chip him,

411
00:37:12,668 --> 00:37:14,918
it won't lessen the political cris.

412
00:37:15,142 --> 00:37:17,914
The info I gave you on dyle's
apartment lead to anything?

413
00:37:18,423 --> 00:37:18,801
Yep.

414
00:37:18,921 --> 00:37:21,107
The place was rented last
week, under an alias.

415
00:37:21,186 --> 00:37:23,085
I ran a search and came
up with a cell phone,

416
00:37:23,152 --> 00:37:25,730
activated the same day, same address.

417
00:37:25,799 --> 00:37:27,487
Can you track the cell phone?

418
00:37:29,142 --> 00:37:30,611
When were you gonna tell us?

419
00:37:30,795 --> 00:37:31,415
Gimme a break,

420
00:37:31,535 --> 00:37:34,108
it just popped up on the grid
as you were walking in.

421
00:37:35,257 --> 00:37:36,344
He's still in town.

422
00:37:36,413 --> 00:37:38,550
Ten blocks away from
where the hit took place.

423
00:37:39,496 --> 00:37:40,767
Let's go get him.

424
00:37:41,195 --> 00:37:43,081
Should I notify the
fbi and metro police?

425
00:37:43,184 --> 00:37:44,184
No.

426
00:37:44,213 --> 00:37:46,571
No, nobody should do anything,
until we think this through.

427
00:37:46,617 --> 00:37:47,908
If vasco is right.

428
00:37:48,028 --> 00:37:50,540
And we're reliving this
day over and over,

429
00:37:50,587 --> 00:37:53,046
we get near dyle and try and chip him,

430
00:37:53,095 --> 00:37:54,412
all he's going to do is rewind the day.

431
00:37:54,471 --> 00:37:55,966
And we start from scratch.

432
00:37:56,448 --> 00:37:58,036
But if dyle rewinds the day,

433
00:37:58,066 --> 00:37:59,900
doesn't that mean that
zhang will be alive?

434
00:38:00,725 --> 00:38:01,725
Again?

435
00:38:02,312 --> 00:38:03,957
Riley, you're a genius!

436
00:38:04,211 --> 00:38:05,772
We knew that.

437
00:38:05,841 --> 00:38:06,881
We can work this.

438
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,206
Is someone gonna clue me in here?

439
00:38:09,332 --> 00:38:11,559
Right now dyle thinks I'm dead.

440
00:38:11,739 --> 00:38:13,369
Why does he think you're dead?

441
00:38:13,415 --> 00:38:15,311
Because he unloaded his gun into me.

442
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,149
According to riley,

443
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:19,346
he hasn't gone back to his apartment.

444
00:38:19,507 --> 00:38:22,144
Which means he still thinks I'm there.

445
00:38:24,185 --> 00:38:25,185
I'm lost.

446
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:28,311
If we can force dyle to replay the day,

447
00:38:28,438 --> 00:38:28,988
I can nail him.

448
00:38:29,108 --> 00:38:30,440
He's already hit his target.

449
00:38:30,553 --> 00:38:32,334
He has no reason to replay the day.

450
00:38:32,436 --> 00:38:33,436
Let's give him one.

451
00:38:53,382 --> 00:38:55,199
Dyle's at his apartment now.

452
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:44,657
How did you get this number?

453
00:39:45,362 --> 00:39:47,154
Your mother gave it to me.

454
00:39:48,496 --> 00:39:49,496
Mother..?

455
00:39:53,072 --> 00:39:53,798
Who are you people?

456
00:39:53,918 --> 00:39:55,132
What do you want?

457
00:39:57,525 --> 00:39:58,525
Revenge.

458
00:40:01,706 --> 00:40:03,668
Say goodbye to "mother."

459
00:40:10,249 --> 00:40:11,484
do what you have to, phillip!

460
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:12,790
Don't let them stop you!

461
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:17,570
Nooo!!!

462
00:40:30,382 --> 00:40:32,290
Vasco better be right about this.

463
00:40:40,762 --> 00:40:42,311
They don't understand...

464
00:40:42,646 --> 00:40:43,994
I can bring mother back.

465
00:40:45,641 --> 00:40:47,479
Jump into the morning and...

466
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:49,944
They don't understand...

467
00:40:50,002 --> 00:40:51,551
I can bring mother back.

468
00:41:23,806 --> 00:41:24,806
jane?

469
00:41:27,549 --> 00:41:28,951
before he works on the wiring.

470
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:33,968
Got a lead on our neuro.

471
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Briefing at 7:00

472
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,320
call connor and riley.

473
00:41:36,407 --> 00:41:37,471
No need to.

474
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,037
What?

475
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:41,168
Seth got a neuro-positive test on dyle.

476
00:41:41,727 --> 00:41:44,108
Riley found out he rented
a downtown office.

477
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:46,383
You think he's going
to assassinate the chinese

478
00:41:46,455 --> 00:41:47,455
foreign minister.

479
00:41:47,669 --> 00:41:49,102
It's not going to happen.

480
00:41:49,276 --> 00:41:50,736
How would you know that?

481
00:41:51,287 --> 00:41:52,726
I just chipped him.

482
00:41:52,779 --> 00:41:53,779
Where are you?

483
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:55,473
Dyle's apartment.

484
00:41:55,959 --> 00:41:57,647
I'll explain when you get here.

485
00:41:57,855 --> 00:41:59,670
And tell joe to be careful.

486
00:41:59,832 --> 00:42:01,331
He should throw the circuit breaker

487
00:42:01,439 --> 00:42:03,242
before he works on the wiring

488
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:10,083
Damn!

489
00:42:14,308 --> 00:42:16,277
Some neuros exploit their powers

490
00:42:16,358 --> 00:42:17,572
in a negative way,

491
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:20,312
but the ability to do things over,

492
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:22,208
keep trying until you get it right,

493
00:42:22,347 --> 00:42:24,755
can be used in a positive way.

494
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,338
What's so funny.

495
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:43,516
How's a guy like riley get anywhere

496
00:42:43,591 --> 00:42:45,129
with a babe like that?

497
00:42:47,956 --> 00:42:48,956
Persistence.

498
00:42:50,277 --> 00:42:51,857
Maybe you could learn a thing or two.

499
00:42:51,965 --> 00:42:52,965
Yeah, right.

500
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:57,422
Come here, you're buying.
