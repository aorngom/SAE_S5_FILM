1
00:00:02,296 --> 00:00:04,827
<i>Mick St. John,
thank you for joining us tonight.</i>

2
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:05,799
<i>You're welcome.</i>

3
00:00:05,994 --> 00:00:07,689
<i>So what's it like
being a vampire?</i>

4
00:00:10,335 --> 00:00:11,985
Being a vampire sucks.

5
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,670
It's a bad joke, I know,
but it's the truth.

6
00:00:14,901 --> 00:00:16,930
- So you drink blood?
- Why, you offering?

7
00:00:17,207 --> 00:00:19,661
I'm just kidding.
Yeah, I have a guy.

8
00:00:19,799 --> 00:00:21,828
- You mean, like a dealer?
- Yeah, like a dealer.

9
00:00:21,967 --> 00:00:24,990
- So you never bite anybody?
- No, no...

10
00:00:25,456 --> 00:00:27,050
unless they really ask for it.

11
00:00:27,244 --> 00:00:29,128
- Do you sleep in a coffin?
- No.

12
00:00:29,265 --> 00:00:32,662
That's an old wives' tale.
I sleep in a freezer.

13
00:00:33,135 --> 00:00:36,861
And while we're on the subject,
garlic is tasty on pizza.

14
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:40,260
- Does it repel you?
- It repels my dates sometimes.

15
00:00:40,825 --> 00:00:42,893
Toss holy water on me,
I get wet.

16
00:00:43,036 --> 00:00:45,630
Crucifixes? Okay,
if you like that kind of thing.

17
00:00:45,816 --> 00:00:48,702
Oh, and I definitely
can't turn into a bat.

18
00:00:48,866 --> 00:00:50,560
That'd be cool,
though, wouldn't it?

19
00:00:50,707 --> 00:00:52,113
What about daylight?

20
00:00:52,295 --> 00:00:53,323
Daylight's not good.

21
00:00:53,607 --> 00:00:54,972
Daylight's not good.

22
00:00:55,207 --> 00:00:56,920
The longer I'm in the sun,
the worse I feel.

23
00:00:57,037 --> 00:00:59,540
- But you don't burst into flames?
- Not if I can help it.

24
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,181
How do you kill a vampire?
Wooden stake, I'm guessing?

25
00:01:02,315 --> 00:01:04,110
No, a wooden stake
won't kill a vampire.

26
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,271
Flamethrower will
kill a vampire.

27
00:01:06,506 --> 00:01:09,722
Or we can lose our head.
I mean, literally.

28
00:01:09,998 --> 00:01:11,450
Other an that, we heal.

29
00:01:12,085 --> 00:01:15,492
You seem like a very nice fellow,
but don't vampires kill people?

30
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:18,413
Most vampires don't have
boundaries or rules, but I do.

31
00:01:18,608 --> 00:01:22,621
I don't hunt women. I don't hunt
children. I don't hunt innocents,

32
00:01:22,856 --> 00:01:25,133
but there's predators out there
who need to be dealt with.

33
00:01:25,165 --> 00:01:26,963
Is that why you became
a private investigator?

34
00:01:28,066 --> 00:01:30,041
It's a way to use my
special abilities.

35
00:01:30,278 --> 00:01:32,393
Any advice for the vampire
wannabes out there?

36
00:01:32,587 --> 00:01:33,233
Yeah...

37
00:01:33,747 --> 00:01:35,201
Stay out of my way.

38
00:01:37,206 --> 00:01:38,960
<i>I often wondered what
it would be like</i>

39
00:01:39,037 --> 00:01:41,303
<i>if I had the opportunity
to explain myself...</i>

40
00:01:43,115 --> 00:01:44,801
<i>but that's just
a fantasy.</i>

41
00:01:46,246 --> 00:01:47,780
<i>Here's the reality.</i>

42
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,791
<i>You sleep alone...</i>

43
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:53,083
<i>you keep your
secrets hidden.</i>

44
00:01:54,997 --> 00:01:58,012
<i>Oh, yeah, and here's what
a dinner party looks like.</i>

45
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:02,163
<i>I know, I know.</i>

46
00:02:02,488 --> 00:02:04,283
<i>Everyone says
they're open-minded.</i>

47
00:02:04,418 --> 00:02:07,721
<i>Everyone tries to accept people
who are different from them.</i>

48
00:02:07,957 --> 00:02:09,082
<i>But the truth is,</i>

49
00:02:09,228 --> 00:02:11,820
<i>people don't react well when
they find out that you're...</i>

50
00:02:12,886 --> 00:02:13,960
<i>undead.</i>

51
00:02:16,057 --> 00:02:18,271
<i>And the other thing you've
got to deal with--</i>

52
00:02:19,665 --> 00:02:21,173
<i>when you live forever,</i>

53
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:23,872
<i>the past always
catches up with you.</i>

54
00:02:25,948 --> 00:02:29,483
<i>Like all good detective stories,
this one starts with a girl...</i>

55
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,123
<i>A promising life cut
tragically short.</i>

56
00:02:32,355 --> 00:02:34,240
<i>Tonight, a killer
is on the loose.</i>

57
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:38,303
<i>Well, technically two girls,
and one of them's already dead.</i>

58
00:02:38,496 --> 00:02:41,083
This is Beth Turner
for "Buzzwire." Cut.

59
00:02:42,105 --> 00:02:44,653
- Really? I was okay?
- Oh, yeah, total Amanpour.

60
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:47,033
I mean, no one would would ever know
it was your very first live webcast.

61
00:02:47,215 --> 00:02:50,230
- We gotta get a shot of the body.
- Cops won't let anyone get close.

62
00:02:50,396 --> 00:02:52,423
I'm not leaving
without my money shot.

63
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:54,350
- Oh, my god. Did I just say that?
- Yes.

64
00:02:54,495 --> 00:02:56,000
I've become a news
whore overnight.

65
00:02:56,145 --> 00:02:57,120
Not... overnight.

66
00:02:57,545 --> 00:02:58,711
Lieutenant Carl!

67
00:03:00,998 --> 00:03:03,472
- Carl, what can you tell me?
- Well, let's see, Beth. Nothing.

68
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:05,182
Come on. I was first on scene.

69
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:08,012
Who fed you the location on
the 710 freeway shooter?

70
00:03:11,045 --> 00:03:13,831
All right, fine. We think she
was a Hearst college student.

71
00:03:13,977 --> 00:03:17,471
She had their mascot tattooed on a
very discreet part of her anatomy.

72
00:03:17,657 --> 00:03:20,150
- Front or back?
- These guys--

73
00:03:20,295 --> 00:03:22,232
Get these cameras out of here!

74
00:03:22,557 --> 00:03:24,480
Get these cameras out of here, now!
Move it!

75
00:03:24,675 --> 00:03:26,792
<i>When you've been around
as long as I have,</i>

76
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,282
<i>you think that nothing
can surprise you anymore,</i>

77
00:03:29,795 --> 00:03:31,302
<i>but that was
before tonight--</i>

78
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,642
<i>before I saw her
walking barefoot</i>

79
00:03:34,827 --> 00:03:37,660
<i>through a freezing fountain
at 2:00 in the morning.</i>

80
00:03:55,206 --> 00:03:56,000
Beth...

81
00:03:56,705 --> 00:03:58,492
Step away from the body.

82
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:04,962
"Murder on Melrose."

83
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:05,803
No.

84
00:04:07,385 --> 00:04:09,741
"Southland Student Slain."

85
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:10,812
Eh.

86
00:04:12,807 --> 00:04:14,073
Vampire.

87
00:04:14,448 --> 00:04:16,381
Something with "vampire" in it.

88
00:04:26,197 --> 00:04:27,552
Do I know you?

89
00:04:29,098 --> 00:04:30,021
You tell me.

90
00:04:32,575 --> 00:04:33,750
You're a cop, right?

91
00:04:34,758 --> 00:04:35,401
No.

92
00:04:36,016 --> 00:04:37,851
- Reporter.
- Nope.

93
00:04:38,688 --> 00:04:40,951
We've met before.
You look very familiar.

94
00:04:41,186 --> 00:04:43,403
Well, maybe I've just
got one of those faces.

95
00:04:45,358 --> 00:04:46,042
Okay.

96
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:50,361
Question. What do
you like better--

97
00:04:50,638 --> 00:04:55,172
- "vampire slaying rocks L.A."--
- There's no such thing as vampires.

98
00:04:56,898 --> 00:04:59,722
I don't think the girl in
the fountain would agree.

99
00:05:00,196 --> 00:05:00,981
I mean--

100
00:05:06,946 --> 00:05:10,952
www.forom.com

101
00:05:11,096 --> 00:05:14,290
1 x 01 :
No Such Thing As Vampires

102
00:05:22,206 --> 00:05:23,852
Come on, Beth. The body's gone.

103
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:26,963
Cops packed up hours ago, okay?
What are we still doing here?

104
00:05:27,107 --> 00:05:28,180
Looking for the girl's car.

105
00:05:28,278 --> 00:05:30,161
Right, and how do we
know she didn't walk?

106
00:05:30,307 --> 00:05:32,323
- Nobody walks in L.A.
- Of course.

107
00:05:32,976 --> 00:05:33,911
Here we go.

108
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,443
Hearst college parking permit.

109
00:05:49,418 --> 00:05:51,671
I need you to check on
that parking decal.

110
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,573
- I can't deal right now.
- No, don't worry about it.

111
00:05:53,607 --> 00:05:54,763
I'll call 'em, I'll call 'em.

112
00:05:56,245 --> 00:05:59,363
200,000 unique visitors
on your vampire story,

113
00:05:59,496 --> 00:06:01,473
and we posted less
than 24 hours ago.

114
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:03,310
The vampire angle was genius.

115
00:06:03,457 --> 00:06:05,891
- Did you come up with that?
- Yeah, it just kinda came to me.

116
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,923
Very nice.
Get me some science on this-- an expert.

117
00:06:09,028 --> 00:06:11,232
Now I wanna blow this thing up,
make it seem real.

118
00:06:11,657 --> 00:06:14,110
"Are there vampires among us?"

119
00:06:14,298 --> 00:06:16,602
I'm letting you run with this.
What's your next move?

120
00:06:16,748 --> 00:06:19,342
Steve got the dead girl's
address from a parking permit.

121
00:06:19,487 --> 00:06:20,761
I think I'll take
a look around.

122
00:06:20,895 --> 00:06:23,673
Don't think. Go.
Mama needs fresh content.

123
00:06:28,508 --> 00:06:30,430
You don't get to change
the rules of the game

124
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:31,833
after the game has started,

125
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:35,030
and that goes for your silent
south American partners, too.

126
00:06:35,408 --> 00:06:37,150
My position is simple, okay?

127
00:06:37,386 --> 00:06:40,260
I'm short the Shanghai A-Shares,
and that was a guaranteed deal.

128
00:06:40,407 --> 00:06:41,412
Guaranteed.

129
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:43,122
Hey, buddy,
let me get rid of this guy.

130
00:06:43,248 --> 00:06:47,263
<i>My friend Josef is one of the
oldest vampires in L.A.--</i>

131
00:06:47,496 --> 00:06:49,760
<i>400, going on 30.</i>

132
00:06:49,948 --> 00:06:54,962
<i>Living... well, unliving proof that
paranoia never goes out of style.</i>

133
00:06:55,106 --> 00:06:58,640
Any default, and I would not be
sleeping so snugly if I were you.

134
00:06:58,887 --> 00:07:01,241
These people are unbelievable--
no integrity.

135
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:04,490
Oh, you don't like veiled threats?
Then how about this?

136
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,033
You screw me,
and I will personally come down there

137
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:08,580
and cut your heart out, okay?

138
00:07:09,005 --> 00:07:10,790
That's the only thing
they understand.

139
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:13,903
Oh, that sounds good.

140
00:07:14,878 --> 00:07:16,343
And my best to the family.

141
00:07:17,088 --> 00:07:19,773
Ah, you look good.
You working out? Little bit, huh?

142
00:07:20,466 --> 00:07:22,352
Well, have you seen the news?

143
00:07:22,426 --> 00:07:24,850
This terrible thing in west Hollywood?
It's everywhere.

144
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,788
"Vampire slaying rocks L.A."

145
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:28,562
Yeah, I know.
It doesn't look good for us.

146
00:07:28,565 --> 00:07:31,151
It's a threat to our secrecy.
What is this, the 1720s?

147
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:33,410
We're discreet.
We don't leave bodies lying around.

148
00:07:33,455 --> 00:07:34,773
Now we have to be
extra vigilant.

149
00:07:34,827 --> 00:07:37,581
We live in an age of fingerprint scans,
D.N.A. tests, genome mapping--

150
00:07:37,606 --> 00:07:41,252
- Josef, relax, okay?
- I am relaxed. This is relaxed.

151
00:07:41,405 --> 00:07:44,173
You're only 90. You've never been
chased by a torch-bearing mob--

152
00:07:44,348 --> 00:07:45,231
Hungry!

153
00:07:46,345 --> 00:07:48,230
Would you care for a
liquid refreshment?

154
00:07:48,465 --> 00:07:50,153
- No, thank you.
- Are you sure?

155
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:54,263
She's delicious.
'82 was a good year.

156
00:07:54,406 --> 00:07:56,431
Oh, we went to the Super
bowl in '82, right?

157
00:07:56,558 --> 00:07:59,001
Lost a million bucks on
Cincinnati that year, right?

158
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,361
- Except for that.
- Yeah.

159
00:08:00,556 --> 00:08:01,682
You're fooling yourself

160
00:08:01,818 --> 00:08:04,321
if you think you can exist on
that retail blood forever.

161
00:08:04,457 --> 00:08:06,343
- I do all right.
- Yeah, for now.

162
00:08:06,715 --> 00:08:09,200
But you're fighting a losing battle,
my friend, okay?

163
00:08:09,276 --> 00:08:12,521
Sooner or later, your inner vampire
is going to demand to be fed,

164
00:08:12,896 --> 00:08:14,682
and then what?

165
00:08:15,237 --> 00:08:16,981
- Good-bye, Josef.
- Good-bye.

166
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,910
<i>My guy at the
morgue, Guillermo,</i>

167
00:08:35,105 --> 00:08:37,083
<i>deals in information
and blood.</i>

168
00:08:38,836 --> 00:08:40,690
<i>Tonight I needed both.</i>

169
00:08:42,428 --> 00:08:44,113
Hey, Mick.

170
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:46,532
- What can I do you for?
- Drinking on the job?

171
00:08:46,677 --> 00:08:48,652
- 40 or 6-pack?
- Give me a sixer.

172
00:08:48,777 --> 00:08:51,183
Oh-ho. Thirsty boy, huh?

173
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:56,933
I don't know why you like
this A-positive so much.

174
00:08:57,257 --> 00:09:00,132
The O-positive has got
a much better finish.

175
00:09:00,275 --> 00:09:02,831
I wanna see the body of the girl
they found at the Design Center.

176
00:09:02,925 --> 00:09:04,231
Yeah, I figured you would.

177
00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:13,821
There's no smell
of vampire on her.

178
00:09:14,105 --> 00:09:16,360
I noticed.
The carotid artery's been severed.

179
00:09:16,505 --> 00:09:18,631
- How much blood loss?
- She exsanguinated.

180
00:09:18,778 --> 00:09:21,980
- At 40% loss, the heart stops.
- Vampire would've drained her.

181
00:09:23,008 --> 00:09:25,642
Those aren't bite marks.
They're too clean.

182
00:09:25,788 --> 00:09:27,722
Plus there's impact
trauma around the wound,

183
00:09:27,855 --> 00:09:29,601
and her neck was
punctured by something.

184
00:09:29,745 --> 00:09:31,342
Call me if you
get anything else.

185
00:09:31,486 --> 00:09:33,360
Oh, yeah, yeah,
'cause I work for you, right?

186
00:09:37,736 --> 00:09:40,281
<i>I didn't intend to
end up a do-gooder.</i>

187
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:42,541
<i>For the longest time,
I was like most people--</i>

188
00:09:42,728 --> 00:09:44,900
<i>just kind of looking
out for myself.</i>

189
00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:49,193
<i>Then 22 years ago, I took a case
that changed my life forever.</i>

190
00:09:55,466 --> 00:10:01,241
Mr. St. John, please help me.
Someone took my daughter.

191
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,382
<i>Some cases really
sucker punch you.</i>

192
00:10:04,476 --> 00:10:07,920
<i>You think you know what you're
getting into, then... wham.</i>

193
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:11,372
The police have nothing.
It's been two days.

194
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:22,653
<i>Whether it's a missing
child or a murdered coed,</i>

195
00:10:22,798 --> 00:10:27,140
<i>victims always leave a trail.
You just have to find it.</i>

196
00:10:28,815 --> 00:10:31,550
<i>Cops had been girl's
apartment since morning.</i>

197
00:10:32,348 --> 00:10:34,650
<i>I'd been waiting
since 6:00.</i>

198
00:10:35,026 --> 00:10:37,342
<i>Looks like I wasn't
the only one.</i>

199
00:11:30,705 --> 00:11:31,550
Aouch.

200
00:11:33,688 --> 00:11:36,231
- You were at the crime scene.
- Easy with the mace, okay?

201
00:11:36,376 --> 00:11:38,541
- Stay back!
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

202
00:11:38,687 --> 00:11:41,232
You're not gonna hurt me?
How do I know you're not the killer?

203
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,162
Well, because I'm
not killing you.

204
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,522
Okay. If you're
not the killer--

205
00:11:47,717 --> 00:11:49,733
and let's go with that,
'cause that's comforting--

206
00:11:50,015 --> 00:11:52,942
- What are you doing here?
- I'm a private investigator.

207
00:11:53,268 --> 00:11:55,101
Let me see your credentials.

208
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,532
"Mick St. John"?

209
00:12:03,247 --> 00:12:04,650
Who are you working for?

210
00:12:04,845 --> 00:12:07,433
Falls under my client
confidentiality agreement.

211
00:12:07,628 --> 00:12:09,860
So don't you wanna know who
I am and what I'm doing here?

212
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,571
You're Beth Turner.
You work for "Buzzwire."

213
00:12:13,825 --> 00:12:15,241
It's entertaining.

214
00:12:15,305 --> 00:12:17,060
Excuse me.
It's not just entertainment.

215
00:12:17,295 --> 00:12:19,361
It's hard-hitting,
investigative--

216
00:12:19,555 --> 00:12:22,183
- Okay, there's a bit of sleaze.
- You're probably the best.

217
00:12:22,415 --> 00:12:24,012
- Best what?
- Thing they have.

218
00:12:25,655 --> 00:12:27,151
Thanks.

219
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:34,462
Let me see.

220
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,690
I saw something just like
it in the victim's car.

221
00:12:42,468 --> 00:12:45,243
Look. Same exact thing.
I've been researching it--

222
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,592
Egyptian hieroglyphic.
The insignia for an ancient blood cult.

223
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:53,212
Right. Blood cult.
So we're talking vampires?

224
00:12:53,918 --> 00:12:55,513
I know. They don't exist.

225
00:12:56,115 --> 00:12:59,000
Something has to explain all the
killing and the goth-o-rama around here.

226
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:01,350
I mean, obviously,
she had a thing for vampires.

227
00:13:01,637 --> 00:13:03,943
Yeah, I guess they're
back in style.

228
00:13:05,195 --> 00:13:07,683
You know, some people actually
find them attractive.

229
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:08,662
Really?

230
00:13:09,448 --> 00:13:10,050
Yeah.

231
00:13:13,588 --> 00:13:15,421
- What is it?
- Blood.

232
00:13:15,655 --> 00:13:17,490
We should get that
to the police.

233
00:13:19,345 --> 00:13:20,711
Hey, honey.

234
00:13:20,947 --> 00:13:23,623
Josh, I'm in the middle of something
right now. Can I call you back?

235
00:13:24,098 --> 00:13:25,651
Okay. Bye.

236
00:13:28,298 --> 00:13:30,181
Stop doing that.

237
00:13:33,705 --> 00:13:35,072
<i>Nine out of ten murders,</i>

238
00:13:35,308 --> 00:13:37,330
<i>the killer is someone
the victim knew.</i>

239
00:13:37,618 --> 00:13:40,441
<i>That's why I wasn't about to
miss Kelly Foster's funeral.</i>

240
00:13:40,908 --> 00:13:43,840
<i>Too bad funerals always
take place during the day.</i>

241
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:48,901
<i>That glance in the grave
always puts everyone on edge,</i>

242
00:13:49,138 --> 00:13:50,742
<i>but when it's murder...</i>

243
00:13:51,575 --> 00:13:52,750
<i>keep your eyes open.</i>

244
00:13:54,286 --> 00:13:56,451
<i>You're gonna see more
than just tears.</i>

245
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:12,842
Thanks for ditching
me the other night.

246
00:14:13,036 --> 00:14:15,293
I knew you'd be all right.
You're resourceful.

247
00:14:16,137 --> 00:14:19,291
Kelly was a bright
and promising student,

248
00:14:19,538 --> 00:14:21,321
and we all mourn her loss.

249
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:25,001
Christian Ellis-- he was Kelly's
social anthropology professor.

250
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:29,211
We inhabit our physical bodies
for what we call a lifetime,

251
00:14:29,355 --> 00:14:31,243
but death holds no dominion.

252
00:14:31,517 --> 00:14:35,431
Kelly Foster lives as
our sister in blood.

253
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,703
I'm guessing the EMOs
with the black roses

254
00:14:38,887 --> 00:14:41,201
are part of his ancient
mythology studies program.

255
00:14:41,435 --> 00:14:43,501
- Did your homework.
- Which I am sharing with you.

256
00:14:43,905 --> 00:14:46,283
Your turn.
Where's the blood vial?

257
00:14:46,656 --> 00:14:50,431
You took a vial of blood from
Kelly's apartment. I want it.

258
00:14:59,396 --> 00:15:01,940
- You son of a bitch!
- Chloe, Chloe! Chloe, Chloe, Chloe!

259
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:06,391
- We still love you. You know that.
- Oh, shut up!

260
00:15:07,836 --> 00:15:09,813
<i>A whiff of fresh
blood on the air,</i>

261
00:15:10,146 --> 00:15:11,831
<i>blood I'd
smelled before.</i>

262
00:15:12,028 --> 00:15:12,910
You okay?

263
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:14,682
I'm okay.

264
00:15:17,705 --> 00:15:21,103
Lot of angry people.
Angry people make good suspects.

265
00:15:21,335 --> 00:15:24,311
- And dangerous ones.
- Don't worry. I'll look out for you.

266
00:15:24,727 --> 00:15:27,270
We should divvy them up.
Two can cover more ground.

267
00:15:27,418 --> 00:15:28,440
I work alone.

268
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,822
A girl's dead.
I'm not letting this go.

269
00:15:32,238 --> 00:15:35,541
- Kind of pushy, aren't you?
- You'll get used to it.

270
00:15:36,386 --> 00:15:40,472
Start with the professor.
I'll take his young attacker.

271
00:15:43,585 --> 00:15:45,902
Wait. What about my vial?

272
00:15:46,138 --> 00:15:48,250
We should get it to the police
so they can analyze it,

273
00:15:48,438 --> 00:15:49,801
find out whose blood it is.

274
00:16:00,106 --> 00:16:01,753
It's the professor's.

275
00:16:17,028 --> 00:16:19,242
What's going on with you
and professor Ellis, Chloe?

276
00:16:19,488 --> 00:16:20,653
What do you mean?

277
00:16:20,885 --> 00:16:23,573
Well, you tried slicing the
guy open at the funeral today.

278
00:16:23,715 --> 00:16:25,363
Christian's a svengali.

279
00:16:25,535 --> 00:16:28,223
He, like, brainwashed Kelly
with all this literary crap

280
00:16:28,408 --> 00:16:32,332
about vampires and
sex and dark desires.

281
00:16:32,705 --> 00:16:34,390
He runs a vampire study group.

282
00:16:34,637 --> 00:16:36,893
- Study group?
- It's a cult.

283
00:16:37,036 --> 00:16:39,251
- What goes on there?
- The usual clichés--

284
00:16:39,347 --> 00:16:42,412
chanting, candles,
blood drinking.

285
00:16:42,555 --> 00:16:45,102
- They drink blood?
- Oh, yeah.

286
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,220
Christian thinks
he's a vampire.

287
00:16:47,775 --> 00:16:50,892
- A real vampire?
- A lot of girls believe him.

288
00:16:51,505 --> 00:16:53,951
He's got a lot of... disciples.

289
00:16:54,136 --> 00:16:56,641
- Were you a disciple?
- Yeah, I was in.

290
00:16:56,877 --> 00:16:59,943
In fact, I was the one who
told Kelly she should join.

291
00:17:01,757 --> 00:17:04,350
- Big mistake that was.
- What happened?

292
00:17:06,487 --> 00:17:10,502
She was all over Christian,
totally fed into his crap.

293
00:17:10,648 --> 00:17:13,621
- And you didn't?
- Yeah, I did.

294
00:17:14,736 --> 00:17:17,091
He's really powerful...

295
00:17:17,795 --> 00:17:19,202
seductive...

296
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,360
makes you feel special.

297
00:17:21,548 --> 00:17:24,042
- But you weren't.
- No.

298
00:17:24,886 --> 00:17:27,142
And that made you
jealous of Kelly?

299
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:32,490
Yeah, and pissed off.
And, no, I didn't kill her,

300
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,801
if that's what
you want to know.

301
00:17:35,966 --> 00:17:39,931
Go write your stupid little
vampire story someplace else.

302
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,252
When I was turned
into a vampire,

303
00:17:52,448 --> 00:17:54,420
all my senses were
heightened to 11.

304
00:17:55,446 --> 00:17:57,131
For god sakes,
you're giving me a headache.

305
00:17:57,305 --> 00:17:59,583
- I'm able to smell the past...
- We need to discuss this.

306
00:17:59,755 --> 00:18:01,632
- Glimpse the future...
- Not now. I have class.

307
00:18:02,426 --> 00:18:04,120
Oh, when should
we discuss this--

308
00:18:04,295 --> 00:18:06,273
when another one of your
students turns up dead?

309
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:09,383
And I can hear a marriage going down
the drain from a hundred yards.

310
00:18:09,618 --> 00:18:12,330
- I had nothing to do with that.
- Is that what we're telling people?

311
00:18:12,578 --> 00:18:14,791
You tell them whatever
the hell you want.

312
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:41,802
Hi. Is professor
Ellis home, please?

313
00:18:41,948 --> 00:18:42,881
He's not here.

314
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:46,702
Oh. Uh, I'm-- I'm sorry to disturb you.
I didn't mean to bother.

315
00:18:46,886 --> 00:18:48,830
Is there something that I
can help you with, mister...

316
00:18:48,867 --> 00:18:51,552
St. John. Mick St. John.
I'm a private investigator.

317
00:18:52,487 --> 00:18:55,690
- This is about the dead girl.
- Yes, I'm looking into the case.

318
00:18:57,278 --> 00:18:58,960
This must bevery
difficult for you.

319
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:01,130
How about I come
back another time?

320
00:19:01,506 --> 00:19:02,860
What do you want to know?

321
00:19:05,058 --> 00:19:08,881
There was a time when Christian
was a serious academic.

322
00:19:09,437 --> 00:19:12,981
He has a PHD in
mythological anthropology.

323
00:19:13,216 --> 00:19:17,611
He published every year.
But now he has other interests.

324
00:19:17,796 --> 00:19:21,151
- Like Kelly Foster?
- Among others.

325
00:19:22,356 --> 00:19:25,103
These girls are so young
and impressionable.

326
00:19:25,656 --> 00:19:28,062
- I used to be that way myself.
- Me, too.

327
00:19:28,345 --> 00:19:32,170
Christian can be very charming...
like a snake.

328
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:36,633
Oh, he's a vampire, by the way.
I don't know if you knew that.

329
00:19:36,896 --> 00:19:37,830
I did not.

330
00:19:38,107 --> 00:19:40,893
At least, that's what he tells
them when he seduces them

331
00:19:41,266 --> 00:19:43,102
in the basement
of Chandler hall.

332
00:19:44,176 --> 00:19:48,472
Mrs. Ellis, do you think your
husband killed Kelly Foster?

333
00:19:48,707 --> 00:19:52,341
The girl had a bite
in her neck, right?

334
00:19:52,628 --> 00:19:55,792
- Right.
- He's the only vampire I know.

335
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:00,650
We have all fed on blood,

336
00:20:01,256 --> 00:20:03,130
every one of you in this room.

337
00:20:03,446 --> 00:20:05,280
Everyone on this earth...

338
00:20:05,555 --> 00:20:09,813
in the womb,
our first meal is blood.

339
00:20:10,557 --> 00:20:12,202
We feed in darkness.

340
00:20:13,455 --> 00:20:14,820
There is no time.

341
00:20:15,938 --> 00:20:17,910
There's no life.
There's no death.

342
00:20:18,615 --> 00:20:20,590
It is a perfect world,

343
00:20:21,528 --> 00:20:23,401
seemingly everlasting,

344
00:20:24,338 --> 00:20:29,872
until we are ripped from
the womb into daylight.

345
00:20:30,695 --> 00:20:32,203
When we are born,

346
00:20:32,387 --> 00:20:35,840
that paradise is lost,
and we spend the rest of our days

347
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:38,143
trying to find our way back--

348
00:20:38,757 --> 00:20:42,623
back to that perfect world
of blood and darkness.

349
00:20:44,156 --> 00:20:45,792
That's enough for tonight.

350
00:20:46,485 --> 00:20:50,601
But remember to take this truth
with you to your everyday lives.

351
00:20:50,837 --> 00:20:54,702
We are all vampires,
every last one of us.

352
00:20:56,107 --> 00:20:57,790
I will see you all next week.

353
00:21:04,065 --> 00:21:06,701
- That was an amazing lecture.
- Thank you.

354
00:21:06,936 --> 00:21:09,862
Hey, I'm Kate Nelson.
I just transferred down from Berkeley.

355
00:21:10,757 --> 00:21:11,973
Welcome.

356
00:21:12,306 --> 00:21:15,083
I read your book,
"The mythology of darkness."

357
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:18,053
Well, that's more than I can
say for a lot of my students.

358
00:21:18,937 --> 00:21:23,332
I think it's really interesting,
the vampire as metaphor for desire.

359
00:21:23,796 --> 00:21:27,573
The thirst for blood is
symbolic of a deeper hunger.

360
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:29,222
A hunger to connect.

361
00:21:31,218 --> 00:21:33,151
You did read my book, huh?

362
00:21:33,336 --> 00:21:34,940
Do you think I could
audit your class?

363
00:21:35,078 --> 00:21:37,390
Well, my lectures are
pretty popular, but

364
00:21:37,718 --> 00:21:39,223
I'm sure we could
squeeze you in.

365
00:21:39,408 --> 00:21:40,911
Thanks. I really appreciate it.

366
00:21:41,147 --> 00:21:42,603
I know I'm a month behind.

367
00:21:42,787 --> 00:21:46,801
Is there a syllabus I could get
started on or some way to catch me up?

368
00:21:50,568 --> 00:21:52,870
Well, I do have a study group

369
00:21:53,066 --> 00:21:55,423
for some of my more
motivated students.

370
00:21:55,618 --> 00:21:57,063
I'm really motivated.

371
00:21:57,537 --> 00:21:58,320
Daniel?

372
00:22:00,505 --> 00:22:03,671
This is Daniel, my T.A.
Daniel, this is kate...

373
00:22:04,096 --> 00:22:07,590
- Nelson.
- Kate Nelson. I'm sorry.

374
00:22:07,778 --> 00:22:09,282
Would you take down
her information?

375
00:22:09,558 --> 00:22:11,351
- Sure.
- I have to get going.

376
00:22:15,295 --> 00:22:19,203
- Hi. Study group, huh?
- Sounds intriguing.

377
00:22:19,616 --> 00:22:22,210
- So how do we get hold of you?
- 3-1-0...

378
00:22:29,146 --> 00:22:31,503
Somewhere in the city,
a killer is on the loose.

379
00:22:32,205 --> 00:22:35,321
Josef wants me to hunt him
to keep our secret safe.

380
00:22:35,468 --> 00:22:37,442
I just want to make sure
he doesn't do it again.

381
00:22:38,537 --> 00:22:41,562
You don't have to be a vampire
to get a taste for blood.

382
00:22:56,135 --> 00:22:58,541
- You startled me.
- I'm Mick St. John.

383
00:22:58,918 --> 00:23:02,413
Right. My wife mentioned
you came by the house.

384
00:23:03,618 --> 00:23:05,552
You're looking into
Kelly Foster's death.

385
00:23:05,877 --> 00:23:07,090
Uh, murder.

386
00:23:08,116 --> 00:23:10,142
Do you mind if I ask
who you're working for?

387
00:23:10,338 --> 00:23:11,692
I'm working for Kelly.

388
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:15,212
Well, then I want to
help in any way I can.

389
00:23:15,618 --> 00:23:19,440
She was an extraordinary girl,
and I...

390
00:23:19,726 --> 00:23:21,181
I truly cared for her.

391
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:23,063
So there was a relationship?

392
00:23:23,298 --> 00:23:26,270
I already told the police everything.
I have nothing to hide.

393
00:23:26,826 --> 00:23:29,091
If I did,
do you think I'd be talking to you?

394
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:36,253
That piece is over
500 years old,

395
00:23:36,426 --> 00:23:39,581
from the reign of Sigismund I--

396
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:42,461
The sign of Vilnius,
a lithuanian vampire god.

397
00:23:42,698 --> 00:23:43,580
Vampire god, huh?

398
00:23:44,378 --> 00:23:45,530
You know, that's interesting,

399
00:23:45,737 --> 00:23:48,452
because Kelly Foster showed up dead
with two bite marks in her neck.

400
00:23:48,686 --> 00:23:50,532
Well, clearly,
someone's trying to make it look

401
00:23:50,567 --> 00:23:52,001
as if I had something
to do with it.

402
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:54,153
Maybe that's because you keep
telling people you're a vampire.

403
00:23:54,187 --> 00:23:56,301
- I am a vampire.
- Really?

404
00:23:56,956 --> 00:24:01,163
Well, not in the way most commonly
portrayed in dime-store novels.

405
00:24:01,347 --> 00:24:02,982
When most people hear
the word "vampire,"

406
00:24:02,996 --> 00:24:06,200
they immediately conjure up an
image of some undead monstrosity

407
00:24:06,536 --> 00:24:09,863
running around at night
trying to drink human blood.

408
00:24:10,518 --> 00:24:11,542
I hate that.

409
00:24:11,828 --> 00:24:15,463
A real vampire is simply a
person born with the ability

410
00:24:15,695 --> 00:24:18,292
to absorb and manipulate
pranic energy.

411
00:24:18,485 --> 00:24:20,082
"Prana" is a hindi
word meaning--

412
00:24:20,266 --> 00:24:22,860
- Life force.
- Yes, very good.

413
00:24:23,057 --> 00:24:26,023
Real vampires have a
critical energy imbalance.

414
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:28,803
So we must seek out pranic
energy and absorb it.

415
00:24:28,948 --> 00:24:31,210
Couldn't you just have a
double espresso or something?

416
00:24:32,557 --> 00:24:35,533
Fresh blood has a very high
pranic energy content,

417
00:24:35,678 --> 00:24:37,743
hence the blood
link to vampires.

418
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:40,863
But when done correctly,
a pranic ceremony can have

419
00:24:41,048 --> 00:24:42,742
salutary effects for
both participants.

420
00:24:42,975 --> 00:24:44,290
So tell me
something, professor--

421
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:46,261
do the salutary effects kick in

422
00:24:46,547 --> 00:24:48,801
before or after the
sex with your students?

423
00:24:49,785 --> 00:24:52,800
I think we're through talking.

424
00:24:55,545 --> 00:24:56,713
All right, thank you.

425
00:24:57,328 --> 00:24:59,200
You know,
if one of the killers you put away

426
00:24:59,437 --> 00:25:01,333
ever wanted to get even,
all they would have to do

427
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:03,322
is wait for the Cochinita
Pibil to go on special.

428
00:25:03,576 --> 00:25:04,940
"Vampire slaying rocks L.A."?

429
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:07,811
- Publicity spawns tips, Carl.
- Yeah, and copycats.

430
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,862
Don't be mad.
I gave you the vial of blood.

431
00:25:10,005 --> 00:25:12,550
- It's inadmissible.
- Did you have it analyzed?

432
00:25:12,747 --> 00:25:15,761
Is it from a person of interest?
The professor of darkness?

433
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,251
You have his D.N.A. on file?

434
00:25:18,528 --> 00:25:21,172
Look, he volunteered a D.N.A.
swab during his first interview.

435
00:25:21,356 --> 00:25:22,343
Cooperative.

436
00:25:22,485 --> 00:25:24,403
Yeah, that's what they
always want you to think.

437
00:25:24,677 --> 00:25:27,981
- What do you have on Chloe Jones?
- You talk to her?

438
00:25:28,117 --> 00:25:30,052
- She seems a little edgy.
- She should be.

439
00:25:30,288 --> 00:25:31,852
We found a stalking and
harassment complaint

440
00:25:31,887 --> 00:25:33,523
filed against her with
the campus police.

441
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:35,262
- Filed by?
- Kelly Foster.

442
00:25:35,686 --> 00:25:37,143
Chloe said they
were best friends.

443
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:40,351
They were. We also found a blood
pendant at Chloe's apartment.

444
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:42,320
They were both sleeping
with the professor.

445
00:25:42,567 --> 00:25:44,300
Well, threesomes
never end well.

446
00:25:44,445 --> 00:25:45,611
- Huh?
- Don't ask.

447
00:25:57,225 --> 00:25:58,493
It's about time you got back.

448
00:26:01,356 --> 00:26:03,330
- Make yourself at home.
- I did,

449
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:04,642
and poured myself a drink.

450
00:26:05,485 --> 00:26:07,033
You seriously drink this stuff?

451
00:26:07,176 --> 00:26:09,100
What is it, like,
nonfat soy vegan blood?

452
00:26:09,248 --> 00:26:10,761
- If you don't like it--
- I didn't say that.

453
00:26:10,795 --> 00:26:12,353
- Are you sure?
- Get out of here.

454
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:15,903
Actually, you got any freshies around?
Yeah, of course not.

455
00:26:16,037 --> 00:26:18,250
Am I supposed to know
why you're here, Josef?

456
00:26:18,997 --> 00:26:23,393
It is possible that there is a core
truth behind the vampire myth.

457
00:26:23,536 --> 00:26:27,271
Perhaps there are people with
certain genetic predispositions

458
00:26:27,418 --> 00:26:31,053
who actually could
require and digest blood.

459
00:26:31,887 --> 00:26:34,460
Vampire experts. Beautiful.

460
00:26:34,608 --> 00:26:36,772
Now we got the food mouthing
off about the farmer.

461
00:26:36,956 --> 00:26:37,992
The whole city is talking.

462
00:26:38,085 --> 00:26:40,003
You want to know what
they're talking about? Us.

463
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:42,562
- So it's a slow news day.
- Oh, that's not it.

464
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:44,662
It's a reporter
from "Buzzwire."

465
00:26:44,835 --> 00:26:47,951
She started this whole killer
vampire thing-- a Beth somebody.

466
00:26:48,098 --> 00:26:50,683
- Turner.
- You know her?

467
00:26:51,295 --> 00:26:53,250
Yeah, we did some breaking
and entering together.

468
00:26:53,556 --> 00:26:55,763
Hmm. Well, you, my friend,
must get her to stop.

469
00:26:55,938 --> 00:26:56,821
What do you mean?

470
00:26:57,005 --> 00:26:59,203
Like she's driving along and
suddenly her car explodes?

471
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:02,150
I was thinking you'd ask her nicely,
but fielder's choice.

472
00:27:02,477 --> 00:27:03,830
The killer's not
a vampire, Josef.

473
00:27:03,978 --> 00:27:06,902
- There were bite marks.
- Two stab wounds.

474
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,071
And the blood?

475
00:27:08,267 --> 00:27:10,530
Well, you hit an artery,
you're bound to get some of that.

476
00:27:10,565 --> 00:27:12,310
Oh, so you're telling
me some poser wannabe

477
00:27:12,447 --> 00:27:15,333
drinking blood out of a snoop
dogg chalice is behind this?

478
00:27:15,566 --> 00:27:17,303
Yeah, something like that.

479
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:18,901
Hmm. Why haven't
you killed him?

480
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,450
There's more than one suspect.

481
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:21,802
So kill them all.

482
00:27:22,577 --> 00:27:24,561
That's what I would do.
Hey, look,

483
00:27:24,706 --> 00:27:27,580
I know you have morals and scruples,
and that's fine... sort of.

484
00:27:27,996 --> 00:27:30,880
But you are not the man I on
occasion pretend to respect

485
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:32,832
if you don't get
this under control.

486
00:27:33,905 --> 00:27:36,122
Hey, you have a soft spot
for the mortal ones,

487
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:38,500
a fascination with all the
charming things they do

488
00:27:38,687 --> 00:27:41,011
while listening to the tick, tick,
tick of their own looming demise.

489
00:27:41,047 --> 00:27:42,701
That's fine. It's good.
Everyone needs a hobby.

490
00:27:42,738 --> 00:27:44,892
Look, people aren't gonna
suddenly believe in vampires

491
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,590
because of a
"Buzzwire" article.

492
00:27:46,787 --> 00:27:48,141
Are you willing to
take that risk?

493
00:27:48,285 --> 00:27:49,842
If everyone have
vampires on their mind

494
00:27:49,886 --> 00:27:52,040
because of some reporter,
suddenly things get noticed.

495
00:27:52,698 --> 00:27:55,620
- We get noticed.
- I said I'm on this.

496
00:27:55,768 --> 00:27:58,171
Good, 'cause if that reporter
actually finds out who we are,

497
00:27:58,435 --> 00:28:00,872
she gets a Pulitzer,
and we join the list of extinct species.

498
00:28:00,937 --> 00:28:02,010
We're on the same side.

499
00:28:02,477 --> 00:28:04,602
I'm sorry.
I'm not questioning your loyalties.

500
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:05,810
Yeah? Good.

501
00:28:06,135 --> 00:28:08,922
Yeah. Vampire solidarity.
Rah, rah, rah and all that.

502
00:28:09,248 --> 00:28:10,373
Hey, and don't forget,

503
00:28:10,518 --> 00:28:12,790
I'm your only friend who doesn't
like you just for your money.

504
00:28:12,828 --> 00:28:15,130
That's true. Sad but true.

505
00:28:27,488 --> 00:28:28,541
We're closed.

506
00:28:32,995 --> 00:28:34,790
Oh. It's you.

507
00:28:36,088 --> 00:28:37,450
It's not funny.

508
00:28:38,338 --> 00:28:40,411
Why are you wearing that
stupid thing anyway?

509
00:28:42,126 --> 00:28:44,480
Take it off.
You're really starting to freak me out.

510
00:28:46,065 --> 00:28:47,431
Did you hear me?

511
00:28:54,347 --> 00:28:56,182
Relationships are complicated.

512
00:28:56,488 --> 00:29:00,032
Vampire or mortal--
that's one thing we have in common.

513
00:29:09,736 --> 00:29:10,953
Yeah, yeah.

514
00:29:13,135 --> 00:29:15,260
Okay, here's what
I don't understand.

515
00:29:16,976 --> 00:29:18,670
I'm fine. How are you?

516
00:29:18,818 --> 00:29:21,530
How did you know the blood we found
in the vial was the professor's?

517
00:29:21,637 --> 00:29:23,712
- You're saying it wasn't?
- No, it was.

518
00:29:23,858 --> 00:29:26,350
He gave the police a D.N.A.
sample, and it matched.

519
00:29:26,957 --> 00:29:29,552
So you must have a source
in the department, right?

520
00:29:29,748 --> 00:29:32,462
No, but obviously you do.

521
00:29:35,435 --> 00:29:38,552
So... what did you
find out about Chloe?

522
00:29:39,848 --> 00:29:42,301
She's got a few anger
management issues.

523
00:29:42,488 --> 00:29:44,852
Turns out our murder victim
got a restraining order

524
00:29:45,037 --> 00:29:46,540
against her a
couple months ago.

525
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:50,583
What's her deal?
The professor toss her aside?

526
00:29:50,906 --> 00:29:52,272
Yeah, but murder?

527
00:29:52,688 --> 00:29:54,281
Check her out.

528
00:29:55,726 --> 00:29:59,221
- Let me know what you think.
- Okay.

529
00:30:00,386 --> 00:30:01,551
What about the wife?

530
00:30:01,747 --> 00:30:05,050
Well, she knows her husband's a snake.
But the professor...

531
00:30:06,217 --> 00:30:08,282
- What?
- He thinks he's a vampire.

532
00:30:08,476 --> 00:30:11,401
Yeah, I know.
I attended his so-called class.

533
00:30:11,548 --> 00:30:12,242
You what?

534
00:30:12,515 --> 00:30:14,922
I also managed to wrangle an
invite to his study group.

535
00:30:16,418 --> 00:30:17,963
I'm not sure that's
a good idea.

536
00:30:18,155 --> 00:30:20,791
What are they gonna do,
kill a newcomer to get extra credit?

537
00:30:21,395 --> 00:30:22,853
I just think you
should be careful.

538
00:30:23,048 --> 00:30:24,831
Don't let the professor
get you alone.

539
00:30:24,975 --> 00:30:26,092
I'll be careful.

540
00:30:27,727 --> 00:30:28,941
Good.

541
00:30:33,268 --> 00:30:35,571
You look so familiar.

542
00:30:35,808 --> 00:30:37,690
Are you sure we
haven't met before?

543
00:30:38,526 --> 00:30:41,210
- Yeah, twice now.
- No, someplace else.

544
00:30:43,028 --> 00:30:44,671
I guess I've just got--

545
00:30:44,816 --> 00:30:46,293
One of those faces.
I know, you said.

546
00:30:50,918 --> 00:30:51,940
I should go.

547
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:11,280
Sometimes the past doesn't
just catch up with you.

548
00:31:11,697 --> 00:31:12,633
It haunts you...

549
00:31:15,098 --> 00:31:16,932
makes you think
about your choices.

550
00:31:18,047 --> 00:31:20,072
On that night 22 years ago.

551
00:31:20,358 --> 00:31:21,191
It's all right.

552
00:31:21,426 --> 00:31:22,740
I followed a trail...

553
00:31:23,028 --> 00:31:24,470
I'm here. It's all right.

554
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:28,053
Found the girl and
came face-to-face

555
00:31:28,317 --> 00:31:30,531
with the woman who'd
made me a monster--

556
00:31:30,727 --> 00:31:31,793
Coraline.

557
00:31:36,537 --> 00:31:38,252
I knew you would come.

558
00:31:40,397 --> 00:31:41,902
Here we are, Mick...

559
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:45,942
finally one happy family.

560
00:31:50,316 --> 00:31:53,991
Forever is a long time
with an ex-wife like mine.

561
00:31:58,128 --> 00:32:00,861
You're taking a long time
putting that mike on.

562
00:32:01,098 --> 00:32:03,312
I'm just trying to get
it exactly right here.

563
00:32:03,508 --> 00:32:04,782
Does that include
feeling me up?

564
00:32:04,955 --> 00:32:06,982
Hey, you're going into
the vampire's lair, okay?

565
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:08,730
I just want to make
sure this mike works.

566
00:32:08,765 --> 00:32:10,691
- I'll be fine.
- I don't know about that.

567
00:32:11,067 --> 00:32:14,752
So... exclusive infiltration of
a college sex and blood cult.

568
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,910
Man, the story just
keeps getting better.

569
00:32:17,465 --> 00:32:19,971
A girl's dead.
This is an important story.

570
00:32:20,247 --> 00:32:22,181
Yeah, it doesn't mean
we can't milk it.

571
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:24,243
A real humanitarian.

572
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:43,940
Chloe?

573
00:32:50,067 --> 00:32:50,912
Chloe?

574
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:53,652
Chloe?

575
00:33:03,037 --> 00:33:03,733
Beth.

576
00:33:23,088 --> 00:33:24,783
Where are we going, exactly?

577
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:27,953
Don't worry.
It's all part of the ritual.

578
00:33:28,135 --> 00:33:29,971
Ritual? I thought it
was a study group.

579
00:33:30,206 --> 00:33:32,282
Yeah. You'll see.

580
00:33:37,388 --> 00:33:40,450
Seriously? The ritual's
in a boiler room?

581
00:33:42,508 --> 00:33:44,100
Hi. You've reached Beth Turner.

582
00:33:44,285 --> 00:33:46,043
I'm unable to answer your
call your call right now,

583
00:33:46,075 --> 00:33:49,092
so please leave a message, and I'll
get back to you as soon as I can.

584
00:33:52,205 --> 00:33:57,883
The spiritual, sexual vampire lurks
between the lines of Sanskrit tablets.

585
00:33:58,026 --> 00:34:03,042
Numeroultures of antiquity believed
that blood was the vital element

586
00:34:03,258 --> 00:34:06,082
in the lovemaking and
life-giving process.

587
00:34:06,327 --> 00:34:09,950
Now all these ancient texts can be
categorized in a number of ways,

588
00:34:10,098 --> 00:34:14,451
but what's most important to us
is the spirit of these texts,

589
00:34:14,587 --> 00:34:15,952
not the letter.

590
00:34:16,608 --> 00:34:17,922
Hi, Kate.

591
00:34:18,105 --> 00:34:21,500
So the ancient tantric practice
of using sexual intercourse

592
00:34:21,735 --> 00:34:26,322
to transform one's sexual energy
into blissful consciousness

593
00:34:27,445 --> 00:34:29,843
speaks to that issue perfectly.

594
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:33,550
Well, I think that's
enough for tonight.

595
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:36,033
I will see you all next week.

596
00:34:38,366 --> 00:34:41,523
Blood is life,
and life is blood.

597
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:44,493
Born into light,
we seek the dark.

598
00:34:45,195 --> 00:34:45,893
Thank you.

599
00:34:49,885 --> 00:34:51,011
Kate.

600
00:34:51,987 --> 00:34:53,400
I'm so glad you could make it.

601
00:34:53,585 --> 00:34:54,800
Seems like I missed it.

602
00:34:54,997 --> 00:34:56,700
I thought I was supposed
to be here at 11:00.

603
00:34:56,738 --> 00:34:58,050
Well, this is your
first session,

604
00:34:58,188 --> 00:35:00,683
and I like to get a little
one-on-one time with my students.

605
00:35:01,195 --> 00:35:01,942
Okay.

606
00:35:02,407 --> 00:35:04,241
So let's go back and talk.

607
00:35:04,987 --> 00:35:06,210
Don't be shy.

608
00:35:18,976 --> 00:35:20,531
Hold out your hands above mine.

609
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:23,880
Right above mine.

610
00:35:25,275 --> 00:35:26,542
Just like that.

611
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:32,090
We are only now rediscovering
what the ancients knew.

612
00:35:32,235 --> 00:35:34,350
We are simply energy.

613
00:35:34,638 --> 00:35:36,902
We both radiate and absorb it.

614
00:35:38,058 --> 00:35:40,081
Concentrate on your hands.

615
00:35:42,825 --> 00:35:44,140
Do you feel that?

616
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,841
Uh... maybe.

617
00:35:49,535 --> 00:35:51,230
It takes a little practice.

618
00:35:52,205 --> 00:35:53,431
Close your eyes...

619
00:35:55,475 --> 00:35:56,642
and concentrate.

620
00:35:57,278 --> 00:36:00,912
Feel your yonic energy
balancing mine.

621
00:36:02,265 --> 00:36:04,103
Do this long enough...

622
00:36:04,706 --> 00:36:07,630
our hearts will synchronize.

623
00:36:09,915 --> 00:36:11,273
Are you kidding me?

624
00:36:11,646 --> 00:36:13,863
This actually works for you?

625
00:36:14,146 --> 00:36:15,931
What do you have under there?

626
00:36:16,165 --> 00:36:17,002
Huh?

627
00:36:17,147 --> 00:36:18,652
What do you have under there?

628
00:36:18,837 --> 00:36:21,411
Get your hands off me. Get off!

629
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:24,600
Are you recording this?

630
00:36:24,787 --> 00:36:26,482
Who are you? Answer me!

631
00:36:29,547 --> 00:36:30,722
Where's the recorder?

632
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:32,831
Give it to me.

633
00:36:39,485 --> 00:36:41,361
Kate! Hey, Kate!
You all right? What happened?

634
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:43,023
- I need to call the police!
- Why? What did he do to you?

635
00:36:43,058 --> 00:36:45,321
- Do you have a cell phone?
- Uh, uh, yeah, in my car.

636
00:37:11,645 --> 00:37:12,962
- Where is she?
- Who?

637
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:14,801
Your new student. Where is she?

638
00:37:15,037 --> 00:37:16,010
No idea.

639
00:37:17,347 --> 00:37:18,502
What do you think--

640
00:37:20,077 --> 00:37:21,532
I don't have a lot of time.

641
00:37:28,228 --> 00:37:31,723
I know she was here, man.
I can smell her on you.

642
00:37:32,328 --> 00:37:34,390
And you're gonna tell
me where she is.

643
00:37:34,636 --> 00:37:35,711
She just left.

644
00:37:37,336 --> 00:37:39,972
But... you can't be real.

645
00:37:40,626 --> 00:37:42,081
That's right, professor,

646
00:37:42,275 --> 00:37:44,672
because there's no such
thing as vampires.

647
00:37:55,968 --> 00:37:58,932
- Why are you doing this?
- You wouldn't understand.

648
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:01,380
- I might.
- Christian's a prophet.

649
00:38:01,565 --> 00:38:03,173
His teachings reveal
the powerful truth

650
00:38:03,408 --> 00:38:04,861
about our vital pranic energy.

651
00:38:05,047 --> 00:38:08,631
We must absorb this energy,
preserve it, not waste it on women.

652
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:16,543
Without these distractions,
Christian can fulfill his true destiny.

653
00:38:16,678 --> 00:38:18,373
- What destiny?
- Hey, hey!

654
00:39:15,846 --> 00:39:17,453
I'm not gonna let you hurt her!

655
00:39:36,716 --> 00:39:38,032
Shouldn't have done that.

656
00:39:54,056 --> 00:39:55,651
Everything's gonna
be all right.

657
00:39:57,048 --> 00:39:58,261
You're not gonna do this.

658
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:00,932
It'll work, Mick,
you, me and baby.

659
00:40:01,307 --> 00:40:04,131
No. I'm not gonna let
you hurt that girl.

660
00:40:06,508 --> 00:40:07,963
I can't let you.

661
00:41:08,275 --> 00:41:09,072
Come on.

662
00:41:10,937 --> 00:41:11,913
I'm gonna take you home.

663
00:41:15,446 --> 00:41:16,142
Good girl.

664
00:41:47,857 --> 00:41:50,972
The last time I held her in my arms,
she was only a child.

665
00:41:51,435 --> 00:41:53,510
Over the years,
I tried to stay close,

666
00:41:53,975 --> 00:41:57,092
just out of sight,
in case she needed me.

667
00:41:57,418 --> 00:41:58,732
And tonight she did.

668
00:42:01,236 --> 00:42:04,150
It's all right. You're with me.

669
00:42:06,005 --> 00:42:07,031
You saved me.

670
00:42:07,368 --> 00:42:09,810
From a graduate student
in mythological studies.

671
00:42:10,376 --> 00:42:11,880
Didn't exactly take Superman.

672
00:42:12,118 --> 00:42:13,661
No, that's not what I meant.

673
00:42:14,546 --> 00:42:16,330
I mean, when I was little.

674
00:42:17,225 --> 00:42:18,912
When I was taken.

675
00:42:19,375 --> 00:42:21,692
You got a really nasty
