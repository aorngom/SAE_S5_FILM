1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,480
? ?

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,510
<i>? ? ? that turned me from a
vampire  back into a human. </i>

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,860
how long will it last?
I don't know.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,250
Maureen? no!

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,010
Ben talbot from the
district attorney's office.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,190
And you are? I'm mick st. john.
I'm a private investigator.

7
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,250
Maureen was killed
by a vampire.

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,290
I can't save beth as a human.

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,960
You have to turn me back.
(snarls)

10
00:00:30,988 --> 00:00:32,630
your face-- what happened?

11
00:00:32,664 --> 00:00:34,608
But vampires and humans
can have sex, man.

12
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:35,642
You're not afraid
beth's gonna get hurt.

13
00:00:35,675 --> 00:00:37,971
<i>you're afraid you're gonna get hurt.
being a vampire</i>

14
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:41,083
is not what's keeping us apart.
it's just you.

15
00:01:02,217 --> 00:01:04,440
He's still on us.
* all alone in my room, think of you *

16
00:01:04,515 --> 00:01:08,111
* at a rate that
is truly alarming *

17
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:11,521
<i>okay. this is a
one-way street. </i>

18
00:01:11,768 --> 00:01:12,862
so?

19
00:01:13,318 --> 00:01:15,963
I'm going one way.
yeah, the wrong way.

20
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:17,480
* I keep looping my
memories of you *

21
00:01:17,506 --> 00:01:19,960
* in my head,
I pretend that you want me *  hang on.

22
00:01:22,858 --> 00:01:25,122
Okay, you can't die.
you can't die.

23
00:01:25,206 --> 00:01:26,930
You cannot die. what?

24
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:28,510
Hmm? nothing. it's fine.

25
00:01:28,538 --> 00:01:30,750
(tires screech) * pretending
that she still wants me *

26
00:01:33,716 --> 00:01:35,363
look, I've worked in many d.
A. 's offices,

27
00:01:35,406 --> 00:01:38,813
and whenever you get
a new boss, well,

28
00:01:38,858 --> 00:01:40,950
everybody runs things differently,
you know?

29
00:01:40,997 --> 00:01:43,043
It's-- it's all about personality.
yeah, but maureen was what

30
00:01:43,076 --> 00:01:45,913
made "buzzwire" work for me.
she was totally supportive

31
00:01:45,957 --> 00:01:48,712
of the kind of stories I wanted to
pursue. and your new boss isn't?

32
00:01:48,725 --> 00:01:50,923
I don't know yet. he's calling
a big meeting this afternoon

33
00:01:50,956 --> 00:01:53,052
to discuss "buzzwire's"
new direction.

34
00:01:53,068 --> 00:01:54,650
Which might not
include stories about

35
00:01:54,678 --> 00:01:57,940
demented college professors or serial
killers.   you've looked at my stories.

36
00:01:57,965 --> 00:02:01,610
Yeah. they're, uh,
not what I expected.

37
00:02:01,646 --> 00:02:03,503
What do you mean?

38
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:04,601
They're not all fluff.

39
00:02:04,637 --> 00:02:07,512
Thanks... I think.

40
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:14,151
* attached to, on my mind,
let me show you *

41
00:02:18,196 --> 00:02:19,390
I can shake him. (tires squeal)

42
00:02:20,237 --> 00:02:21,670
* I can't stop
thinkin' about you *

43
00:02:21,698 --> 00:02:24,001
* and I can't stop
thinkin' about you *

44
00:02:24,016 --> 00:02:26,131
* and you never could
or would do what I do *

45
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,700
* and I can't stop
thinkin' about you *

46
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,721
* I can't stop
thinkin' about you *

47
00:02:29,747 --> 00:02:32,111
* I can't stop
thinkin'  about you *

48
00:02:32,157 --> 00:02:35,692
* and you never could
or would do what I do *

49
00:02:40,756 --> 00:02:43,802
no, no, no, no, no!

50
00:02:45,185 --> 00:02:46,543
* can't stop thinkin'
about you *

51
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:53,051
you did it. you lost him.

52
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:54,641
That j-turn gets
them every time.

53
00:02:54,665 --> 00:02:56,472
Okay, so you've
done that before.

54
00:02:56,505 --> 00:02:59,421
Afraid so. welcome to my world.

55
00:02:59,785 --> 00:03:02,082
So... you've been
reading my stories.

56
00:03:02,126 --> 00:03:04,640
You've asked me to lunch. why?

57
00:03:04,868 --> 00:03:08,282
Nothing nefarious. I just...
wanted to learn more about you,

58
00:03:08,337 --> 00:03:10,113
and we went through some
pretty heavy stuff together.

59
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:11,293
Yeah, it's not like
you get kidnapped

60
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:13,073
by a plastic surgeon every day.

61
00:03:13,107 --> 00:03:15,643
We almost died, you know?
and I keep wanting to talk about it,

62
00:03:15,668 --> 00:03:17,822
but I can't seem to
explain it  to most people.

63
00:03:17,857 --> 00:03:19,912
Well, you can't unless
you experienced it.

64
00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:23,110
There's no point of reference.
exactly. (laughs)

65
00:03:23,128 --> 00:03:24,461
you know,
I still don't understand how mick

66
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,731
and that other guy got us out of there.
(brakes screech)

67
00:03:36,227 --> 00:03:37,352
(ben) who is that?

68
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:38,802
Where did you learn
to drive like that?

69
00:03:38,836 --> 00:03:40,951
Three sessions at the
nascar training track.

70
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,770
Oscar gift bag, 2006.

71
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:44,782
Nice.

72
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:46,322
You ready?

73
00:03:48,817 --> 00:03:51,172
* I put myself at ease *

74
00:03:51,776 --> 00:03:52,902
(woman) tierney!
(paparazzi shouting at once)

75
00:03:52,935 --> 00:03:54,200
is that tierney taylor?

76
00:03:54,236 --> 00:03:58,713
Yeah, making her "look at me.
I'm a celebrity" entrance.

77
00:03:58,856 --> 00:04:00,621
<i>(mick) being human again,
however briefly, </i>

78
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,831
<i>put me back out into the world,
and it made me realize</i>

79
00:04:03,847 --> 00:04:07,083
<i>i was tired of hiding.
beth was right when she said</i>

80
00:04:07,118 --> 00:04:09,983
<i>that being a vampire
doesn't have to define me. </i>

81
00:04:10,036 --> 00:04:13,123

82
00:04:13,235 --> 00:04:15,140
<i>but jumping into
this world</i>

83
00:04:15,176 --> 00:04:18,270

84
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,892

85
00:04:24,696 --> 00:04:26,403
<i>welcome to hollywood. </i>

86
00:04:27,118 --> 00:04:29,103
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
too close.

87
00:04:29,126 --> 00:04:30,942
No such thing.

88
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:00,901
Are you sure you're not hungry?

89
00:05:02,027 --> 00:05:05,472
Yeah. I had a big breakfast.
doesn't this bother you?

90
00:05:05,675 --> 00:05:08,362
I expect it here...
or at kitson, the grove--

91
00:05:08,457 --> 00:05:10,553
anyplace they think a
celebrity will show up.

92
00:05:12,585 --> 00:05:15,370
But they were waiting
outside my house this morning

93
00:05:15,395 --> 00:05:17,762
like they knew exactly
what time I was leaving.

94
00:05:17,796 --> 00:05:20,151
And they shouldn't have.
I sent fake schedules

95
00:05:20,196 --> 00:05:22,363
to your manager,
your agent, your publicist.

96
00:05:22,397 --> 00:05:24,262
Well, we know it's not them
tipping off the paparazzi.

97
00:05:24,297 --> 00:05:28,062
No, it's somebody close to you,
like a friend, your boyfriend.

98
00:05:28,097 --> 00:05:31,451
No. no way.
this nightmare is affecting scott, too.

99
00:05:31,496 --> 00:05:34,341
Doesn't scott's band have a
new album that's coming out?

100
00:05:34,616 --> 00:05:37,352
Look, I'm just saying maybe
he wants the publicity.

101
00:05:37,456 --> 00:05:39,103
I get it. I'm a celebrity.

102
00:05:39,137 --> 00:05:41,280
I chose to live my life
in the public eye,

103
00:05:41,327 --> 00:05:43,060
but... I at least have to have

104
00:05:43,096 --> 00:05:44,871
a couple people in my
life  that I can trust.

105
00:05:44,906 --> 00:05:46,403
That's why you hired me--

106
00:05:47,377 --> 00:05:49,292
to make sure you trust
the right people.

107
00:05:54,795 --> 00:05:55,831
Jason.

108
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:57,780
(laughs) tierney. mmm.

109
00:05:58,088 --> 00:06:00,131
Honey, you look
fabulous as usual.

110
00:06:00,796 --> 00:06:02,012
Oh, this one's new.

111
00:06:02,047 --> 00:06:03,782
Oh, no, jason,
this is mick st. john.

112
00:06:03,817 --> 00:06:06,722
He's overseeing some new
security arrangements.

113
00:06:06,905 --> 00:06:07,770
Mick, this is jason abbott.

114
00:06:07,805 --> 00:06:09,581
He's producing my new movie,
"lusitania. "

115
00:06:09,838 --> 00:06:13,020
and this little girl is the
reason for "lusitania. "

116
00:06:13,066 --> 00:06:15,301
we're gonna have a
billion-dollar franchise

117
00:06:15,337 --> 00:06:16,113
on our hands.

118
00:06:16,138 --> 00:06:19,610
Yeah, now that we finally have
a start date, I am so excited.

119
00:06:23,847 --> 00:06:26,511
Would you two excuse me?
I'm going to the ladies' room.

120
00:06:31,328 --> 00:06:32,452
Hot lunch date?

121
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:34,732
Very hot.

122
00:06:35,277 --> 00:06:37,250
And sunny.
definitely too much sun.

123
00:06:38,848 --> 00:06:40,193
It's not a date.

124
00:06:41,035 --> 00:06:44,500
Are you working for tierney taylor?
what do you know about her?

125
00:06:44,606 --> 00:06:45,870
Just what everybody does--

126
00:06:46,068 --> 00:06:49,060
what her favorite color is,
everybody she's ever dated,

127
00:06:49,095 --> 00:06:50,752
what she had for
dinner  last night.

128
00:06:51,297 --> 00:06:52,222
Right.

129
00:06:53,117 --> 00:06:54,943
Look, I've been meaning to call
you about the other night.

130
00:06:54,976 --> 00:06:57,030
(lowers voice) the other
night when you kissed me?

131
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,092
So, uh,
how do you wanna do this?

132
00:07:00,255 --> 00:07:01,580
(normal voice) it's
called dating.

133
00:07:02,095 --> 00:07:05,190
Right. we, uh, we go out,
get to know each other.

134
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:06,872
You've known me since I was 4.

135
00:07:06,887 --> 00:07:09,263
Okay, it's weird when
you say it like that.

136
00:07:09,626 --> 00:07:15,093
(man) tierney! tierney!
miss taylor, look here!

137
00:07:29,685 --> 00:07:32,423
Hey, hey. how was lunch?

138
00:07:33,118 --> 00:07:34,183
What, are you following me?

139
00:07:34,756 --> 00:07:35,830
Oh, not me.

140
00:07:38,197 --> 00:07:41,242
Hottie, huh? you should put
it up on your facebook page.

141
00:07:41,775 --> 00:07:43,022
You've seen my facebook page?

142
00:07:43,057 --> 00:07:44,571
Of course I've seen
your facebook page.

143
00:07:44,696 --> 00:07:47,660
Hmm. did you like it?

144
00:07:47,694 --> 00:07:50,978
Yeah. and I was surprised
that Mr. skulk-in-the-shadows

145
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:52,262
is suddenly all
over the internet.

146
00:07:52,295 --> 00:07:54,021
Yeah, well, you know,

147
00:07:54,059 --> 00:07:55,890
I want to expand my business,
and I realize that

148
00:07:55,907 --> 00:07:59,962
I need to put myself out there a bit
more, so... your flashy new client will
certainly see to that.

149
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:02,892
Now this tierney girl--
yes, I know. I know.

150
00:08:02,938 --> 00:08:04,722
She's a celebrity,
and you're concerned

151
00:08:04,807 --> 00:08:07,601
that I'm endangering myself to this
kind of public exposure.  yeah.

152
00:08:07,635 --> 00:08:10,621
But don't worry, dad.
I'll, uh, I'll be careful.

153
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:13,881
<i>don't call me that.
well, you did turn me. </i>

154
00:08:13,908 --> 00:08:17,003
<i>re-turned you.
okay, re-turned. </i>

155
00:08:17,136 --> 00:08:19,060
and you were gonna become
a vampire again anyway,

156
00:08:19,136 --> 00:08:21,611
and I'm not your sire.
you're kinda my step-sire, though.

157
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:22,513
No.

158
00:08:23,788 --> 00:08:25,901
Now... you wanna know
what I was gonna say?

159
00:08:25,946 --> 00:08:29,422
I was gonna say tierney
reminds me of jean harlow.

160
00:08:30,787 --> 00:08:32,302
You went out with jean harlow?

161
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:34,472
I mostly stayed in
with jean harlow.

162
00:08:34,525 --> 00:08:37,031
<i>now if I were going to give
you advice, which I'm not, </i>

163
00:08:37,055 --> 00:08:39,492
d say go for it.
okay, have some fun.

164
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:41,441
But for somebody
who's finally decided

165
00:08:41,477 --> 00:08:43,172
to join the 21st century,

166
00:08:43,296 --> 00:08:47,583
you're going from zero to 60 in
about half a second. jean harlow?

167
00:08:47,787 --> 00:08:48,971
Yeah.

168
00:08:49,555 --> 00:08:50,411
As reporters,

169
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,902
you've all been scrupulous
about  researching your stories

170
00:08:53,936 --> 00:08:57,493
and--and checking your
sources  and not intruding

171
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,431
into people's privacy.

172
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,523
<i>and while you've
been  doing that, </i>

173
00:09:03,568 --> 00:09:06,932
"buzzwire" has been
scooped  on an hourly basis

174
00:09:06,985 --> 00:09:10,803
by tmz and perez hilton
and ain't it cool news.

175
00:09:10,846 --> 00:09:12,873
So... new rule--

176
00:09:12,945 --> 00:09:16,722
if you hear amy winehouse
is out snortin' vodka shots

177
00:09:16,748 --> 00:09:19,461
with prince harry, run with it!

178
00:09:19,495 --> 00:09:21,213
Yeah. and if it's not true?

179
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,480
We'll retract it later.
so... off you go,

180
00:09:24,496 --> 00:09:28,350
my little scoopsters.
get me that news.

181
00:09:31,678 --> 00:09:33,491
Hi, Mr. lewis. I'm beth turner.

182
00:09:33,618 --> 00:09:36,380
<i>oh, I know.
I've had my eye on you. really? </i>

183
00:09:36,407 --> 00:09:40,250
I hear you have an in with tierney
taylor's new boyfriend.   scott walsh?

184
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,310
Mick st. john.
oh, he's not tierney's boyfriend.

185
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:47,210
He's a private investigator. even
better. more likely to have the inside
scoop on the curse.

186
00:09:47,445 --> 00:09:49,523
The curse?
on tierney's new movie--

187
00:09:49,576 --> 00:09:51,553
the jason
abbott "lusitaniathing.

188
00:09:51,575 --> 00:09:54,240
The start date's been pushed back,
like, three times.  so you think there's

189
00:09:54,275 --> 00:09:58,943
a supernatural curse on the movie? of
course not, but it makes  for a
great headline.

190
00:09:58,976 --> 00:10:01,601
So abbott's throwing a
party for the movie tonight.

191
00:10:01,636 --> 00:10:03,122
I scored you an invite,

192
00:10:03,155 --> 00:10:05,622
and since you're in so
tight  with her new hottie,

193
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:09,473
<i>i'm expecting you to come back
with something hot!   okay. </i>

194
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:10,833
okay?

195
00:10:15,318 --> 00:10:16,912
<i>the last time I saw
the "gray ghost"</i>

196
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:19,271
<i>was december 1942. </i>

197
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:22,080
<i>i was with my regiment, </i>

198
00:10:22,117 --> 00:10:24,700
<i>sailing from new
york  to england, </i>

199
00:10:24,728 --> 00:10:26,361
<i>scared to death. </i>

200
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:30,151
<i>off the coast of scotland,
we got hit by a 92-foot wave, </i>

201
00:10:30,188 --> 00:10:31,713
<i>almost capsized. </i>

202
00:10:33,888 --> 00:10:35,711
<i>some guy wrote a
book  about it. </i>

203
00:10:35,725 --> 00:10:37,970
<i>he called it "the
poseidon adventure"--</i>

204
00:10:38,007 --> 00:10:40,650
<i>exaggerated things a bit,
but I like to think</i>

205
00:10:40,697 --> 00:10:43,463
<i>the gene hackman character
was based on me. </i>

206
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,112
oh, please. don't shoot.

207
00:10:46,657 --> 00:10:48,682
Tierney taylor's new boyfriend.

208
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:51,252
<i>who I am is none of your business.
who are you? </i>

209
00:10:51,297 --> 00:10:55,100
I'm dean foster, and actually,
everything that tierney does--

210
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:56,803
<i>it is my business. </i>

211
00:10:56,838 --> 00:10:59,050
that's called stalking.
it's called making a living.

212
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:02,103
Oh, yeah?
you getting any help with that?

213
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:05,422
Anyone close to tierney been tipping you
off? you think  I would tell you that?

214
00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:07,241
Look, I get the whole
obsessed fan thing.

215
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:08,111
You've seen all her movies.

216
00:11:08,148 --> 00:11:11,752
You feel like there's some connection--
listen, I don't give a damn
about tierney.

217
00:11:11,785 --> 00:11:14,562
The only thing I care about is
how much I can make off her.

218
00:11:14,568 --> 00:11:20,063
The girl's my ride, man.
dude, I've been knocked out

219
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:22,950
by guys way more
famous than you,

220
00:11:22,997 --> 00:11:25,192
so go ahead. hit me,

221
00:11:25,228 --> 00:11:27,852
and then we'll see how much
I can squeeze outta you.

222
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:29,843
Come on.

223
00:11:31,406 --> 00:11:33,210
I don't have time
for trash like you.

224
00:11:39,486 --> 00:11:41,693
I told you this was a
paparazzi-free night.

225
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:42,972
You're here to
have a good time.

226
00:11:42,996 --> 00:11:46,112
You don't pay me to party. well, I don't
pay you to be my bodyguard, either.

227
00:11:46,127 --> 00:11:48,410
Why don't you just think
of it as a night off?

228
00:11:49,397 --> 00:11:50,713
Go talk to your friend.

229
00:11:51,867 --> 00:11:52,953
What friend?

230
00:11:53,428 --> 00:11:58,603
(jason) how many movies? uh...
I saw you with her at lunch.

231
00:11:59,158 --> 00:12:00,502
Yes. she's um...

232
00:12:00,827 --> 00:12:04,002
That was...
last week, I was talking to malcolm...

233
00:12:04,026 --> 00:12:05,483
I think we're dating.

234
00:12:05,508 --> 00:12:07,102
<i>you think? </i>

235
00:12:07,247 --> 00:12:08,663
well, it's complicated.

236
00:12:09,477 --> 00:12:10,860
Can you be yourself with her?

237
00:12:10,876 --> 00:12:12,203
Mostly, yeah.

238
00:12:12,216 --> 00:12:13,982
Then uncomplicate it.

239
00:12:13,987 --> 00:12:15,461
Scott, let's go, babe.

240
00:12:15,478 --> 00:12:16,362
* hot *

241
00:12:16,398 --> 00:12:20,061
* there ain't that
much room at the top *

242
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,631
* yeah, ah, yeah, ah *

243
00:12:21,668 --> 00:12:23,810
(jason) I know I
look more mature,

244
00:12:23,836 --> 00:12:25,812
and, hey, look,
this is a mature town.

245
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,422
It needs mature people.

246
00:12:27,687 --> 00:12:29,223
* gotta get to the top *

247
00:12:30,247 --> 00:12:33,760
<i>that was the most boring
conversation of my entire life. </i>

248
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:36,262
tierney's producer has
the most uelievable ego.

249
00:12:36,286 --> 00:12:38,772
Who were those other guys?
were they abbott's bodyguards?

250
00:12:38,798 --> 00:12:41,882
Investors. they're paying
for the movie and this party.

251
00:12:45,526 --> 00:12:46,992
Looks like tierney's
having fun.

252
00:12:47,426 --> 00:12:49,542
Yeah. she doesn't
get to relax much.

253
00:12:50,408 --> 00:12:51,581
So, uh...

254
00:12:51,788 --> 00:12:54,471
Where does a vampire
take a girl on a date?

255
00:12:55,027 --> 00:12:57,653
I don't know. the usual places.

256
00:12:57,908 --> 00:12:58,911
Probably not a
lot of restaurants.

257
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:01,473
I'm guessing you get
bored  watching women eat.

258
00:13:02,536 --> 00:13:05,511
Actually, I haven't exactly

259
00:13:05,557 --> 00:13:08,511
been in a romance
relationship with a human

260
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:09,953
since I became a vampire.

261
00:13:09,978 --> 00:13:13,862
What? do you mean, you haven't...
not with a human.

262
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:17,360
Wow.  it's not like you've
slept with a vampire.

263
00:13:17,386 --> 00:13:20,611
Maybe once in college,
but I was really drunk. right.

264
00:13:29,316 --> 00:13:30,781
(tierney) and what else are
you doing behind my back?

265
00:13:30,817 --> 00:13:34,773
I can't believe you don't trust me.
how can i, when you do  stuff like this?

266
00:13:34,828 --> 00:13:37,702
I'm not the one keeping
secrets, tierney.

267
00:13:40,878 --> 00:13:42,703
I'll meet you inside.  (sighs)

268
00:13:51,075 --> 00:13:54,083
are you okay? it's nothing.

269
00:13:54,346 --> 00:13:56,091
It looked like something to me.

270
00:13:56,465 --> 00:13:58,210
It's a misunderstanding,
that's all.

271
00:13:59,157 --> 00:14:00,703
I'm gonna go to my
stateroom and fix my face.

272
00:14:00,737 --> 00:14:02,803
Okay. I'll come with.
no, I'm fine.

273
00:14:04,228 --> 00:14:06,120
You really are very nice.

274
00:14:17,845 --> 00:14:19,322
* now you're famous *

275
00:14:19,345 --> 00:14:22,073
* do you know the
price you pay? *

276
00:14:22,117 --> 00:14:26,620
* I hope that ain't contagious,
I ain't gonna live that way *

277
00:14:26,646 --> 00:14:28,703
* thank you, no *

278
00:14:28,727 --> 00:14:29,952
* but I don't need to go... *

279
00:14:29,968 --> 00:14:33,012
there you are.
I've been looking for you.

280
00:14:33,508 --> 00:14:34,530
I'm sorry about that.

281
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:35,880
Not a problem.

282
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:38,093
Look, i-i've gotta
get back to "buzzwire"

283
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,913
and fabricate a hot story.

284
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,870
Did you hear that?  what?

285
00:14:57,408 --> 00:14:58,770
It's tierney.

286
00:15:00,055 --> 00:15:01,440
Mick, no!

287
00:15:24,817 --> 00:15:25,841
Hey, show some respect.

288
00:15:25,878 --> 00:15:28,570
For what?
some drunk actress who fell overboard?

289
00:15:32,275 --> 00:15:33,760
You wanna go for a swim, too?

290
00:15:35,256 --> 00:15:36,163
Excuse me.

291
00:15:37,265 --> 00:15:38,123
Was she drunk?

292
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:41,782
No, she wasn't drunk.
I would've smelled it on her.

293
00:15:42,547 --> 00:15:45,040
Where are you going?
tierney's stateroom.

294
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:52,981
It had to be an accident.

295
00:15:53,006 --> 00:15:54,991
Who would have a reason
to kill tierney?

296
00:15:55,796 --> 00:15:57,201
Nobody I know of.

297
00:15:58,315 --> 00:16:00,441
But since I was
reviewing the security,

298
00:16:00,496 --> 00:16:03,272
if she was in danger,
I should've known about it.

299
00:16:03,298 --> 00:16:04,992
You can't think
this is your fault.

300
00:16:05,037 --> 00:16:08,522
I told her she could trust me,
that I'd look out for her.

301
00:16:09,015 --> 00:16:10,522
And now she's dead.

302
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:19,660
What is it?

303
00:16:22,778 --> 00:16:24,103
(sniffs) blood.

304
00:16:25,807 --> 00:16:26,872
This was wiped

305
00:16:26,905 --> 00:16:28,562
and put back.

306
00:16:29,087 --> 00:16:30,421
Somebody hit her? (sniffs)

307
00:16:33,998 --> 00:16:36,072
she was dragged from the room.

308
00:16:40,106 --> 00:16:41,911
Tierney was murdered.

309
00:16:42,716 --> 00:16:43,983
Well...

310
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:46,173
What a pleasant surprise.

311
00:16:46,185 --> 00:16:48,472
What are you doing he?
he's here  because the d. A. 's office

312
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,263
wants to make sure that
the police don't screw up

313
00:16:50,295 --> 00:16:53,163
another high-profile celebrity case.
is that right?

314
00:16:53,185 --> 00:16:55,613
Either way,
I need you both to clear the scene.

315
00:16:59,528 --> 00:17:00,963
The display case.

316
00:17:01,816 --> 00:17:03,060
What about it?

317
00:17:04,548 --> 00:17:06,452
The anchor's your
murder weapon.

318
00:17:09,856 --> 00:17:11,182
Bag it.

319
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:23,202
What amazing luck,
you being on the scene like that.

320
00:17:23,238 --> 00:17:24,452
Tmz didn't have anyone there,

321
00:17:24,465 --> 00:17:25,933
and perez hilton's
just sitting at home,

322
00:17:25,965 --> 00:17:27,820
waiting for somebody
to e-mail him.

323
00:17:27,855 --> 00:17:29,290
I already have the headline--

324
00:17:29,327 --> 00:17:32,270
"wild child tierney
takes drunken plunge. "

325
00:17:32,305 --> 00:17:33,740
tierney wasn't drunk.

326
00:17:33,766 --> 00:17:36,002
Okay, if we're wrong,
we'll--we'll do a retraction.

327
00:17:36,045 --> 00:17:39,442
But in the meantime, we-- it's okay that
people think  she deserved what
she got?

328
00:17:39,895 --> 00:17:41,843
I can't help what people think.

329
00:17:43,057 --> 00:17:46,913
(lowers voice) there is a chance
that this was murder. seriously?

330
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:50,100
<i>yes, but don't post this until
I have the facts straight, </i>

331
00:17:50,126 --> 00:17:53,063
or I'm not writing it,
and you have no on-the-spot story.

332
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:56,630
<i>this would go so
great with murder. </i>

333
00:17:56,657 --> 00:17:58,671
okay, I'm thinking splash page.

334
00:17:58,716 --> 00:18:00,250
Don't ask me what
I paid for it.

335
00:18:00,285 --> 00:18:01,451
Where did you get this?

336
00:18:01,486 --> 00:18:05,340
Dean foster.
and he's got more where that came from.

337
00:18:14,918 --> 00:18:18,692
Mick! welcome back to
the land of the undead.

338
00:18:19,536 --> 00:18:22,160
Here for a little a-positive?
I restocked.

339
00:18:22,325 --> 00:18:23,932
No, I'm here about tierney.

340
00:18:24,995 --> 00:18:26,173
Yeah, it's a shame.

341
00:18:27,198 --> 00:18:28,522
I liked her movies.

342
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:31,151
Never actually saw one.

343
00:18:31,538 --> 00:18:32,883
Oh, she did a nch
of teen movies.

344
00:18:32,908 --> 00:18:33,791
I mean, not really my thing,

345
00:18:33,826 --> 00:18:36,631
but matinee at the
chinese theatre--

346
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:40,313
best air-conditioning in town,
like a giant freezer unit.

347
00:18:40,935 --> 00:18:42,881
Yeah, if your freezer
smells like popcorn.

348
00:18:42,927 --> 00:18:44,863
<i>dude, I sleep here. </i>

349
00:18:44,885 --> 00:18:47,432
popcorn would be a
huge improvement.

350
00:18:48,036 --> 00:18:50,421
You know, the press are
saying this was an accident,

351
00:18:50,955 --> 00:18:52,071
that she was drunk.

352
00:18:52,106 --> 00:18:54,150
You know her blood
alcohol  was normal.

353
00:18:54,308 --> 00:18:57,300
The c. O. d. was a temporal skull
fracture. so she was hit in the head?

354
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:59,610
Yeah, with this anchor.

355
00:18:59,795 --> 00:19:01,502
I found traces of
her blood on it,

356
00:19:01,606 --> 00:19:04,141
and the shape
matches the fracture.

357
00:19:04,165 --> 00:19:05,152
Where'd you get it?

358
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,822
Uh... a. d. a.
talbot brought it in.

359
00:19:15,425 --> 00:19:16,220
Hey.

360
00:19:16,248 --> 00:19:17,770
Hey. guillermo confirmed it.

361
00:19:17,795 --> 00:19:19,222
Tierney was dead before
she hit the water.

362
00:19:19,255 --> 00:19:22,273
Someone at the party killed her.
I came to show you this.

363
00:19:23,356 --> 00:19:26,101
Grant bought it off a
paparazzo named dean foster.

364
00:19:26,888 --> 00:19:28,913
I ran into him on the
dock before the party.

365
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,622
To get the shot,
he had to be on the boat,

366
00:19:30,646 --> 00:19:34,672
so how did he get past security without
an invite? (sighs) I don't know.

367
00:19:34,695 --> 00:19:37,782
Maybe whoever's leaking
him information got him in.

368
00:19:37,965 --> 00:19:40,680
Look, I gotta speak with
tierney's boyfriend scott.

369
00:19:40,705 --> 00:19:43,223
I gotta find out what they were
arguing about.   I would love to help,

370
00:19:43,257 --> 00:19:45,501
but grant insists I speak
to tierney's producer.

371
00:19:45,527 --> 00:19:48,443
He wants a quote using the words
"movie" and "cursed. " (scoffs)

372
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:52,163
listen, once you're done,
you, uh, you wanna come by?

373
00:19:52,198 --> 00:19:55,271
We could...
share some information.

374
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:56,551
I'd like that.

375
00:19:59,896 --> 00:20:02,002
They weren't here five minutes ago.
who are they after?

376
00:20:02,036 --> 00:20:04,843
Hey, tierney's boyfriend!
over here!

377
00:20:04,855 --> 00:20:06,981
Go. save yourself.
see you later.

378
00:20:20,065 --> 00:20:21,123
Hey.

379
00:20:21,628 --> 00:20:24,573
<i>hey. you little punk,
give me that camera. </i>

380
00:20:24,596 --> 00:20:27,480
man, you kidding?
you know how much this thing costs?

381
00:20:30,085 --> 00:20:32,043
The camera, lost boy.

382
00:20:40,586 --> 00:20:42,042
You should be ashamed
of yourselves,

383
00:20:42,078 --> 00:20:45,522
making a living like this.
talk about bloodsuckers.

384
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:47,422
It's perfect. we work at night.

385
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,501
We can get places
other people can't.

386
00:20:52,697 --> 00:20:56,783
You're a smoker?
what are you doing, kid?

387
00:20:57,606 --> 00:20:59,721
What? it's gonna
stunt my growth?

388
00:21:02,065 --> 00:21:04,441
What can you tell me
about dean foster?

389
00:21:04,605 --> 00:21:05,942
He's a little
intense for the work.

390
00:21:05,977 --> 00:21:09,770
I mean, we'll take a picture of anyone,
but old dean?

391
00:21:09,995 --> 00:21:12,163
(scoffs) well,
let's just say he lacks diversity

392
00:21:12,186 --> 00:21:13,181
in his subject matter.

393
00:21:13,215 --> 00:21:17,962
Let me guess--tierney taylor.
where can I find him?

394
00:21:17,997 --> 00:21:19,612
Nobody's seen him
since she died.

395
00:21:19,636 --> 00:21:21,821
He's probably curled up in
his shrine room, crying.

396
00:21:21,858 --> 00:21:25,761
Mm-hmm. can you keep
your colleagues off me?

397
00:21:26,095 --> 00:21:30,170
In the name of vamp solidarity,
we'd love to help, but...

398
00:21:30,197 --> 00:21:33,691
You're a celebrity p. I.
now. you're the story, dude.

399
00:21:39,295 --> 00:21:42,510
Well, the movie's dead.
the studio pulled the plug.

400
00:21:42,526 --> 00:21:45,041
I heard the studio thinks
the movie was cursed.

401
00:21:45,066 --> 00:21:46,870
<i>sometimes I even think
there's a curse. </i>

402
00:21:46,897 --> 00:21:51,570
you know, every time we're ready to
roll, something happens. like the fire
on the stage  and the boat sinking?

403
00:21:51,585 --> 00:21:53,713
Heal the bay's still on
my case for that one.

404
00:21:53,726 --> 00:21:56,271
Now tierney's accident...

405
00:21:56,526 --> 00:21:59,840
Except it wasn't an accident.
looks like murder.

406
00:21:59,876 --> 00:22:03,022
Now who'd wanna murder tierney? well,
that's what I'm trying to find out.

407
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:05,003
Well, that's pretty ballsy of you,
miss turner,

408
00:22:05,608 --> 00:22:08,370
chasing down tierney's killer.
you should sell me your story.

409
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,573
I could get cameron diaz
to play you, easy.

410
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:13,061
Well, why didn't you get
her to replace tierney?

411
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,423
<i>nah. tierney
was the movie. </i>

412
00:22:14,456 --> 00:22:17,300
the studio'd never let
me  do it without her.

413
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:26,043
You think I killed her?
I loved her.

414
00:22:26,085 --> 00:22:27,521
People kill for
love  all the time.

415
00:22:27,527 --> 00:22:28,991
Tierney and I fought
sometimes, sure,

416
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:31,013
but we-- we always made up.

417
00:22:31,186 --> 00:22:34,413
At the party,
what was the argument about?

418
00:22:39,017 --> 00:22:41,523
I found out she was hiding
something for me, okay?

419
00:22:42,518 --> 00:22:45,623
I was upset. the two of us--
we didn't have secrets.

420
00:22:47,128 --> 00:22:48,880
Everybody has secrets, scott.

421
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:50,593
Not me and tierney.

422
00:22:51,607 --> 00:22:52,432
I heard a message

423
00:22:52,466 --> 00:22:54,770
that her business
manager left for her.

424
00:22:55,568 --> 00:22:59,241
She paid this paparazzo, dean,

425
00:22:59,266 --> 00:23:01,860
50 grand to keep some
photos  off the market.

426
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:04,143
When I asked her about it,
she blew up.

427
00:23:04,835 --> 00:23:06,380
I figured dean had snapped her

428
00:23:06,437 --> 00:23:08,433
fooling around with
some other guy.

429
00:23:09,436 --> 00:23:10,741
Maybe you, even.

430
00:23:16,205 --> 00:23:19,493
There was nothing going on
between myself and tierney.

431
00:23:22,466 --> 00:23:23,923
Yeah, I didn't want to believe
she was cheating on me,

432
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:26,013
but when she
wouldn't tell me...

433
00:23:29,237 --> 00:23:31,762
My band hasn't hit. . yet.

434
00:23:32,467 --> 00:23:34,212
<i>tierney had, and, um, </i>

435
00:23:34,405 --> 00:23:36,581
it was tough, sure, but...

436
00:23:37,906 --> 00:23:39,541
We loved each other,

437
00:23:39,555 --> 00:23:43,312
and, um,
whenever tierney was keeping from me,

438
00:23:43,878 --> 00:23:45,723
we... we would have
worked it out.

439
00:23:58,375 --> 00:23:59,080
Come on. what are you doing?

440
00:23:59,116 --> 00:24:00,791
I'm watching for paparazzi.

441
00:24:01,258 --> 00:24:02,281
I figure we got
about ten minutes

442
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:04,071
before they track me down...

443
00:24:04,557 --> 00:24:06,150
(vehicle approaches) or less.

444
00:24:12,348 --> 00:24:13,672
Mick!

445
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,590
Oh, god. mick...

446
00:24:24,397 --> 00:24:25,762
Here.

447
00:24:28,388 --> 00:24:29,952
(panting) let's get inside.

448
00:24:52,917 --> 00:24:56,050
You okay? yeah.

449
00:24:58,405 --> 00:25:01,152
? ?

450
00:25:01,165 --> 00:25:03,230
<i>whoever's after you is--
wait, wait. after me? </i>

451
00:25:03,255 --> 00:25:06,283
<i>yeah, what do you think, they're
trying to kill me?  they were headed
right for you. </i>

452
00:25:06,315 --> 00:25:08,690
I pushed you out of the way.
you had to push me out of the way,

453
00:25:08,726 --> 00:25:12,982
<i>because I was standing next to you.
maybe they're after both of us. </i>

454
00:25:13,126 --> 00:25:15,841
I mean, my case and your story
both connect to tierney, right?

455
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:19,160
Maybe we're closer to a
killer than we thought.

456
00:25:19,455 --> 00:25:20,983
What did abbott say?

457
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:23,912
There's definitely something
weird going on with the movie,

458
00:25:24,196 --> 00:25:26,463
and, uh,
now the studio's  shut it down.

459
00:25:26,646 --> 00:25:29,252
They're not gonna replace tierney?
no, but the movie was insured,

460
00:25:29,306 --> 00:25:31,883
so the investors will
get their money back.

461
00:25:32,136 --> 00:25:33,902
What about tierney's boyfriend?

462
00:25:34,298 --> 00:25:37,482
We found out that tierney was
paying dean off. for what?

463
00:25:37,857 --> 00:25:40,452
I don't know, but scott thought
tierney was cheating on him

464
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:42,721
and that dean had found
out and blackmailed her.

465
00:25:42,757 --> 00:25:46,773
Maybe she got tired of paying him,
and he killed her.

466
00:25:46,805 --> 00:25:48,453
Or she wasn't really
paying him at all.

467
00:25:48,485 --> 00:25:50,620
Maybe the boyfriend was lying
to cover up his own guilt.

468
00:25:50,656 --> 00:25:55,761
No. the boyfriend's only crime is being
in an emo band. what's wrong with emo?

469
00:25:57,168 --> 00:25:59,342
Nothing, when they were
influenced by husker du,

470
00:25:59,538 --> 00:26:01,323
but now they all just
copy  jimmy eat world,

471
00:26:01,358 --> 00:26:04,382
and, well,
that explains dashboard confessional,

472
00:26:04,427 --> 00:26:05,510
doesn't it?

473
00:26:05,766 --> 00:26:08,011
I like dashboard confessional.

474
00:26:08,927 --> 00:26:10,062
No, you don't.

475
00:26:13,837 --> 00:26:14,970
Where you going?

476
00:26:15,925 --> 00:26:17,033
Home.

477
00:26:17,057 --> 00:26:18,652
Not alone, you're not.

478
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:20,720
Somebody just tried to kill you.
well, you can't drive me.

479
00:26:20,756 --> 00:26:23,213
There's paparazzi outside.

480
00:26:25,176 --> 00:26:27,261
Well, then you should
probably stay here, then...

481
00:26:27,297 --> 00:26:28,490
With me.

482
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:32,413
Oh, wow.
from dating to speed dating.

483
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:35,073
<i>no, I don't mean with me,
with me. </i>

484
00:26:35,096 --> 00:26:36,840
I mean, I just--
I can't drive you,

485
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:39,591
and my couch is...
comfortable, and...

486
00:26:39,697 --> 00:26:42,323
Besides, I sleep in my
freezer upstairs, so...

487
00:26:43,565 --> 00:26:47,633
Okay. well,
better safe than sorry.

488
00:26:48,628 --> 00:26:49,620
Okay.

489
00:26:53,435 --> 00:26:54,651
(clears throat) and, you know,
I mean, if you need anything,

490
00:26:54,688 --> 00:26:56,911
I'm, uh,
I'm just right upstairs anyway.

491
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,233
In your freezer.

492
00:26:59,086 --> 00:27:00,132
Yeah.

493
00:27:02,377 --> 00:27:03,543
Sweet dreams.

494
00:27:04,837 --> 00:27:06,291
You, too.

495
00:27:07,946 --> 00:27:09,901
* now waking to the sun *

496
00:27:09,936 --> 00:27:11,131
* I calculate what I had done *

497
00:27:11,887 --> 00:27:13,040
* like jumping from the bow *

498
00:27:13,815 --> 00:27:15,090
* just to prove
that I knew how *

499
00:27:18,848 --> 00:27:21,071
you know, tierney spends $1,
000 a month

500
00:27:21,118 --> 00:27:22,631
on cat grooming.

501
00:27:23,057 --> 00:27:26,080
<i>cat... grooming. </i>

502
00:27:26,455 --> 00:27:26,970
(types on keyboard) wait.
whoa, whoa.

503
00:27:27,006 --> 00:27:27,882
Here's... something.

504
00:27:27,916 --> 00:27:30,732
A check for 50 grand
to dean foster?

505
00:27:31,928 --> 00:27:34,222
<i>scott was right.
tierney is paying him off. </i>

506
00:27:34,755 --> 00:27:35,610
this is weird.

507
00:27:35,637 --> 00:27:37,941
Her--her business manager,
ryan gold--

508
00:27:38,066 --> 00:27:39,643
he writes all her
checks, right?

509
00:27:39,877 --> 00:27:42,880
Well, there's a payroll account,
which is how he gets paid,

510
00:27:42,915 --> 00:27:46,321
but every month like clockwork,
he also writes himself a check

511
00:27:46,358 --> 00:27:50,281
from her personal account--
20 grand a pop.

512
00:27:51,825 --> 00:27:54,372
Maybe she found out gold
was embezzling from her.

513
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:57,052
(ben) "i sort of remember
seeing that guy"

514
00:27:57,067 --> 00:27:58,892
isn't gonna stand up in court.

515
00:27:59,516 --> 00:28:00,842
Look, depose him again.

516
00:28:00,897 --> 00:28:02,840
Somebody tried to
kill me  last night.

517
00:28:02,976 --> 00:28:04,913
Ugh, listen,
I have to call you back.

518
00:28:06,417 --> 00:28:08,070
Seems to happen a lot.

519
00:28:08,088 --> 00:28:09,880
Well, I wouldn't say a lot.
(stammers)

520
00:28:10,075 --> 00:28:12,321
I'm looking into the
tierney taylor murder.

521
00:28:13,406 --> 00:28:14,412
(scoffs) because I
asked you not to.

522
00:28:14,447 --> 00:28:15,822
And the car that
almost  ran me down

523
00:28:15,856 --> 00:28:17,192
might lead to
something important.

524
00:28:17,207 --> 00:28:19,402
Can you run the plate? why me?

525
00:28:20,386 --> 00:28:22,802
What if I told you that
everything I've found

526
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:24,211
points to one suspect,

527
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:27,072
and he might be the same guy who tried
to kill me? which suspect would this be?

528
00:28:27,107 --> 00:28:31,030
Dean foster--paparazzo
with an unhealthy interest

529
00:28:31,055 --> 00:28:33,350
in tierney.
yeah, well, tierney wasn't the first.

530
00:28:33,397 --> 00:28:34,451
You know about him?

531
00:28:34,497 --> 00:28:36,373
Yeah. he's a person
of interest.

532
00:28:36,407 --> 00:28:38,813
Look, five years ago,
an actress filed

533
00:28:38,835 --> 00:28:40,093
a restraining order
against foster,

534
00:28:40,127 --> 00:28:42,582
which he proceeded to
violate with wild abandon.

535
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:46,030
Threat management got involved,
but foster wouldn't back off.

536
00:28:46,367 --> 00:28:47,912
The actress finally
moved off to london,

537
00:28:47,945 --> 00:28:49,762
and foster moved on
to someone new.

538
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:53,100
So tierney became more than
just a subject to him,

539
00:28:53,137 --> 00:28:56,292
and then she rejected him,
and he killed her? it's possible, yeah.

540
00:28:56,437 --> 00:28:57,983
Well, why haven't
you  picked him up?

541
00:28:58,198 --> 00:29:00,390
Because we haven't found him yet.
(cell phone rings)

542
00:29:02,318 --> 00:29:03,413
I gotta take this.

543
00:29:03,446 --> 00:29:05,481
I'll get back to you on the
license plate, all right?

544
00:29:11,678 --> 00:29:14,972
Everyone thought she was one of those...
vapid little girls

545
00:29:15,015 --> 00:29:16,933
who runs around
without underwear,

546
00:29:17,268 --> 00:29:20,310
gets married to ys they meet
in gas station bathrooms.

547
00:29:22,216 --> 00:29:23,610
(sighs) tierney
wasn't like that.

548
00:29:25,926 --> 00:29:27,113
Sorry.

549
00:29:28,407 --> 00:29:30,360
Ahem. you're probably
looking for what we owe you.

550
00:29:30,446 --> 00:29:32,453
Actually, I'm here to talk about
a payment that tierney made

551
00:29:32,486 --> 00:29:36,853
to dean foster.
it was a private matter.

552
00:29:37,217 --> 00:29:40,231
What about the $20,
000 checks that you cut each month

553
00:29:40,248 --> 00:29:41,653
from tierney's account?

554
00:29:42,428 --> 00:29:43,583
Is that a private matter, too?

555
00:29:43,608 --> 00:29:45,832
Yes. leave it alone.

556
00:29:47,056 --> 00:29:48,291
Well, you can tell me,

557
00:29:49,267 --> 00:29:52,600
or I'm gonna find out myself,
and if I do that,

558
00:29:52,888 --> 00:29:54,510
it may not remain private.

559
00:30:02,638 --> 00:30:04,232
"tierney taylor"
wasn't her real name.

560
00:30:04,258 --> 00:30:07,311
She legally changed it.
her dad was a drunk.

561
00:30:07,516 --> 00:30:09,280
He'd slap tierney
and her mom around,

562
00:30:09,368 --> 00:30:12,912
and thenne day, her mom had enough.
she snapped.

563
00:30:13,307 --> 00:30:14,630
She killed him?

564
00:30:14,827 --> 00:30:18,422
When she got out of jail,
she was an emotional wreck.

565
00:30:19,427 --> 00:30:21,470
And tierney bought
her mom a house,

566
00:30:21,878 --> 00:30:24,282
hired staff, private doctors.

567
00:30:24,797 --> 00:30:27,773
But the payments--they
couldn't  trace back to her.

568
00:30:27,808 --> 00:30:29,303
So you made them in your name.

569
00:30:30,305 --> 00:30:31,931
That kid would've done
anything to keep her mom

570
00:30:31,966 --> 00:30:33,253
out of the limelight.

571
00:30:33,726 --> 00:30:36,943
And then somehow dean found out.
despicable freak.

572
00:30:37,888 --> 00:30:39,572
So in the middle of
everything else,

573
00:30:39,766 --> 00:30:41,583
we had to find the
money to pay him off.

574
00:30:41,628 --> 00:30:42,780
"everything else"?

575
00:30:42,815 --> 00:30:44,371
Her movie, "lusitania"--

576
00:30:44,405 --> 00:30:46,251
tierney was shelling
out her own money

577
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:48,783
for costumes, swimming lessons,

578
00:30:49,475 --> 00:30:51,353
abbott kept saying he
was gonna reimburse her,

579
00:30:51,828 --> 00:30:53,120
and she kept believing him

580
00:30:53,316 --> 00:30:55,510
because he swore he wouldn't
make the movie without her.

581
00:30:57,157 --> 00:30:59,032
Frankly, I'm surprised
he stuck to his word.

582
00:31:00,466 --> 00:31:02,602
I thought it was the studio
that shut the movie down.

583
00:31:02,645 --> 00:31:05,911
No. it was all
abbott's decision.

584
00:31:13,898 --> 00:31:14,993
Hey, mick, what's up?

585
00:31:15,015 --> 00:31:16,971
No-go on the business manager.

586
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:19,113
I did find out that
tierney's pouring a whole lot

587
00:31:19,148 --> 00:31:20,911
of her own money into
the movie, though.

588
00:31:22,437 --> 00:31:24,863
And it wasn't the studio
that shut the movie down.

589
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:28,703
It was abbott.  then why would abbott
telle the studio was behind it?

590
00:31:29,685 --> 00:31:31,261
(sighs) look, go see logan.

591
00:31:31,286 --> 00:31:33,111
See what you can
dig up  on abbott.

592
00:31:53,857 --> 00:31:54,891
Beth turner.

593
00:31:54,926 --> 00:31:56,282
Dean foster.

594
00:31:57,756 --> 00:31:58,963
Did you get my e-mail?

595
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:00,772
Pictures of mick st. john?

596
00:32:00,797 --> 00:32:03,003
Yeah, he's not a story
without tierney taylor.

597
00:32:03,026 --> 00:32:06,452
"buzzwire's" not interested.
I didn't send them to "buzzwire. "

598
00:32:06,485 --> 00:32:07,931
<i>i sent them to you. </i>

599
00:32:09,305 --> 00:32:10,360
so how did st. john

600
00:32:10,385 --> 00:32:14,373
get hit by a car,
then just get up and walk away?

601
00:32:15,057 --> 00:32:16,163
I don't know.

602
00:32:16,788 --> 00:32:18,512
I'm willing to bet
that you do know.

603
00:32:19,496 --> 00:32:20,370
What do you want?

604
00:32:20,385 --> 00:32:21,863
You get a tip on a hot story,

605
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:24,312
I'm gonna be the first
person  that you call.

606
00:32:24,348 --> 00:32:27,881
From now on,
I get all of "buzzwire" exclusives.

607
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:33,190
Otherwise, mick st.
john becomes my number one priority.

608
00:32:33,738 --> 00:32:34,940
It's up to you.

609
00:32:42,536 --> 00:32:44,742
Logan discovered that
abbott was broke.

610
00:32:44,767 --> 00:32:46,401
He spent all of the
investors' money

611
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:48,741
before they even shot
a frame of film.

612
00:32:48,837 --> 00:32:50,330
He needed the insurance
to pay them back,

613
00:32:50,365 --> 00:32:51,663
and the only way to do that

614
00:32:51,688 --> 00:32:54,002
was if the plug was
pulled  on the movie.

615
00:32:54,047 --> 00:32:56,753
And that meant getting
rid of tierney. mm-hmm.

616
00:32:59,525 --> 00:33:01,172
Hey! abbott!

617
00:33:01,848 --> 00:33:02,903
Hey.

618
00:33:03,778 --> 00:33:06,480
I was just, uh,
I was just heading off to a meeting.

619
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:07,921
For your next movie?

620
00:33:08,878 --> 00:33:10,070
Fish gotta swim.

621
00:33:14,306 --> 00:33:16,732
I'll never, you know,
forget tierney.

622
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:19,291
Yeah, me neither.

623
00:33:20,347 --> 00:33:20,881
There is one thing

624
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,811
we were hoping you
could clear up, though.

625
00:33:22,975 --> 00:33:26,010
Sure. yeah, um, I'm--
I'm glad to help, but...

626
00:33:27,265 --> 00:33:28,311
You know what?

627
00:33:28,786 --> 00:33:32,512
I lefty... phone inside.
I'll be right back, okay?

628
00:33:36,318 --> 00:33:38,233
He's making a run for it.

629
00:33:38,597 --> 00:33:41,433
Yeah. they always do.

630
00:33:44,057 --> 00:33:45,582
<i>chasing people is
so much different</i>

631
00:33:45,618 --> 00:33:47,083
<i>when you're a vampire. </i>

632
00:33:47,276 --> 00:33:49,381
<i>a vampire is always
in control. </i>

633
00:33:50,177 --> 00:33:52,470
<i>it's easy to forget that
it isn't just a game. </i>

634
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:57,121
<i>and I can't deny
the rush... </i>

635
00:34:01,757 --> 00:34:03,351
<i>please. ...
when I catch the bad guy. </i>

636
00:34:03,387 --> 00:34:05,171
<i>i didn't wanna kill her.
then why did you? </i>

637
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:06,913
I had to pay back
the investors.

638
00:34:06,968 --> 00:34:09,861
With tierney gone,
the insurance kicked in force majeure.

639
00:34:09,897 --> 00:34:12,713
It's not an act of god when
you kill somebody, abbott.

640
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:14,883
You murdered that girl.

641
00:34:15,098 --> 00:34:16,692
She would have done
anything for you,

642
00:34:16,705 --> 00:34:17,993
but you killed her!

643
00:34:18,025 --> 00:34:20,121
My investors are bad news.

644
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:23,623
They were gonna kill me.
I had to shut the movie down.

645
00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:26,623
Look, i-i tried other things.
I sicced the paparazzi on her.

646
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:27,723
I thought it would
stress her out.

647
00:34:27,758 --> 00:34:29,843
I tried to get her to drop
out of the movie on her own,

648
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:32,022
and nothing worked.

649
00:34:36,615 --> 00:34:38,122
Let's go.

650
00:34:42,338 --> 00:34:44,743
(man) hey, who is that?
(man) jason abbott.

651
00:34:44,768 --> 00:34:48,011
(woman) mick, did he kill tierney
taylor? (man) did he kill
tierney taylor?

652
00:34:48,036 --> 00:34:50,512
Hey, get these vultures outta here.
(camera shter clicking)

653
00:34:51,348 --> 00:34:53,191
(man) hey, abbott,
why'd you do it?

654
00:34:54,917 --> 00:34:57,273
I ran the partial.
it traced back to abbott.

655
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:59,862
But I guess you already knew that, huh?
we just came to talk to him.

656
00:34:59,895 --> 00:35:02,131
He confessed. it'd be better
if he confessed to the police.

657
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,413
I'm sure he'll give
a repeat performance.

658
00:35:11,895 --> 00:35:14,531
I guess that's the end of
my 15 minutes of fame.

659
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:21,050
What happens when
a vampire thinks

660
00:35:21,086 --> 00:35:22,903
he's about to be exposed?

661
00:35:23,516 --> 00:35:29,431
He moves on, changes cities,
names, starts all over.

662
00:35:29,476 --> 00:35:30,753
Have you ever done that?

663
00:35:30,808 --> 00:35:35,430
No, but I've been careful...
and lucky.

664
00:35:35,478 --> 00:35:37,711
I suppose one day my
luck will run out,

665
00:35:38,775 --> 00:35:39,990
but until then,

666
00:35:40,756 --> 00:35:41,920
listen...

667
00:35:42,905 --> 00:35:44,673
How about dinner tonight?

668
00:35:44,696 --> 00:35:46,080
Arbor bistro?

669
00:35:46,495 --> 00:35:47,860
It's a great restaurant.

670
00:35:48,726 --> 00:35:50,481
They grow all their
own vegetables.

671
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:53,280
You are gonna get so
tired  of watching me eat.

672
00:35:54,327 --> 00:35:55,432
I hope so.

673
00:35:57,458 --> 00:35:58,661
It's a date.

674
00:36:13,636 --> 00:36:15,833
The rest of the
paparazzi have moved on,

675
00:36:15,856 --> 00:36:17,082
but dean won't.

676
00:36:17,337 --> 00:36:19,052
He won't stop stalking mick.

677
00:36:20,066 --> 00:36:21,920
And eventually he'll get
a picture of mick vamping

678
00:36:21,957 --> 00:36:23,372
or drinking blood.

679
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:25,351
You know,
this whole digital revolution

680
00:36:25,377 --> 00:36:27,192
is bad for vampires.

681
00:36:27,567 --> 00:36:29,633
Back in the day,
a photo didn't matter.

682
00:36:30,076 --> 00:36:32,222
Because vampires come
out blurry on film?

683
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:36,090
It's the silver ne the emulsion,
and all a blurry photo proves

684
00:36:36,105 --> 00:36:38,021
is the
photographer's incompetence.

685
00:36:38,055 --> 00:36:40,291
Are you speaking from
personal experience?

686
00:36:40,316 --> 00:36:41,273
Let's just say there was

687
00:36:41,298 --> 00:36:43,090
a, uh,
particularly rowdy night  at garbo's

688
00:36:43,128 --> 00:36:48,033
I wouldn't want documented. don't tell
me. you're the reason she wanted to
be alone.

689
00:36:48,058 --> 00:36:50,873
Now, beth, you wouldn't want me
to kiss and tell, would you?

690
00:36:56,145 --> 00:36:59,040
So what do you want me to do
about this foster character?

691
00:37:02,176 --> 00:37:04,323
I thought you could handle it,
you know?

692
00:37:04,358 --> 00:37:05,700
Pay him off or something.

693
00:37:05,736 --> 00:37:07,281
Yeah, well,
you think that'll work?

694
00:37:08,758 --> 00:37:09,742
No.

695
00:37:14,135 --> 00:37:15,821
Well, then you know how
I'm gonna handle it.

696
00:37:17,506 --> 00:37:18,942
Mick has protected me

697
00:37:19,547 --> 00:37:21,690
and saved me more
times than I can count.

698
00:37:22,485 --> 00:37:24,183
And you're returning the favor.

699
00:37:27,776 --> 00:37:29,020
Just don't tell him
we're doing this.

700
00:37:29,056 --> 00:37:30,412
I can keep a secret.

701
00:37:37,898 --> 00:37:39,693
But as long as you're
involved with mick

702
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,211
and you work at "buzzwire, "

703
00:37:42,796 --> 00:37:44,900
his secret will
always be in danger.

704
00:38:06,906 --> 00:38:07,762
I, um...

705
00:38:07,788 --> 00:38:08,702
Yeah?

706
00:38:11,628 --> 00:38:13,153
(sighs) I have
something to tell you.

707
00:38:16,165 --> 00:38:17,413
I quit "buzzwire. "

708
00:38:18,558 --> 00:38:19,600
why?

709
00:38:20,235 --> 00:38:21,333
Well, with maureen gone,

710
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:23,222
there's not even a veneer
of respectability,

711
00:38:23,255 --> 00:38:25,330
and I'm not gonna make a
living  feeding off people

712
00:38:25,347 --> 00:38:27,291
like some kind of...

713
00:38:32,726 --> 00:38:35,211
Yes, well, um...

714
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,740
I suppose we're all vampires
in one form or another.

715
00:38:43,785 --> 00:38:45,060
To vampires.

716
00:38:46,518 --> 00:38:47,883
To us.

717
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:10,333
Hey. get outta her kid.
come on.

718
00:39:10,365 --> 00:39:11,643
Come on.
there ain't nothing  for you to see.

719
00:39:11,677 --> 00:39:13,071
Go on. move along.

720
00:39:16,996 --> 00:39:18,920
Hey, I'm talkin' to you,
you little punk.

721
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,511
Go on. get outta here.

722
00:39:20,536 --> 00:39:22,312
Hey, don't you got a
curfew or somethin'?

723
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:27,672
<i>not in over a hundred years or so...
punk. </i>

724
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,840
hey, what's going on?

725
00:39:37,695 --> 00:39:39,001
(whispers) oh, god, no.

726
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,411
I'm thinking yes. (snarls)

727
00:39:52,966 --> 00:39:54,740
<i>and for the last time, </i>

728
00:39:54,915 --> 00:39:57,450
<i>this is beth turner
reporting for "buzzwire. "</i>

729
00:40:03,495 --> 00:40:05,041
(man) * don't blame me *

730
00:40:05,338 --> 00:40:06,203
* I had a vision *

731
00:40:06,255 --> 00:40:10,821
* and a whole philosophy
of how things are to *

732
00:40:11,678 --> 00:40:13,241
* be *

733
00:40:14,126 --> 00:40:23,982
