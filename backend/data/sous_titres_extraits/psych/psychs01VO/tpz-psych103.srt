1
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:16,011
Hey, Shawn, what in the world
do you think you're doing?

2
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:18,175
Hide and seek.
I don't think so.

3
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:20,549
But you said we could.
Not like that.

4
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,848
That's how you play.

5
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:24,481
Not in my house.
Shawn, you can't tail
a suspect like that.

6
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:28,960
Look how loud you are.
Your perp is gonna hear
you coming from every turn.

7
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,963
Those things smack
every time you take a step.

8
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,056
Now, if you're gonna
wear them when you compete,
you gotta keep...

9
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,157
Compete?

10
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:37,670
(WHISPERING)
On the balls of your feet.
Balls of your feet.

11
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,366
And you take deliberate steps.

12
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,567
You don't know where he is.

13
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,402
He shouldn't get to know
where you are.

14
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:48,213
He's invisible,
you're invisible.

15
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:52,280
Now, you've leveled
the playing field.
Can I go now?

16
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:54,912
No. You're going to learn
to do the little things right.

17
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:56,216
For instance,

18
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,215
when you peer
around a corner,

19
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:02,386
I want you to stay
down low 'cause, you see,

20
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,657
they're expecting you
up here at eye level.

21
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,722
When you walk down a hall,

22
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,928
check the grains
of the carpet.
We just vacuumed, right?

23
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,763
And never, ever again
do I ever want to
hear you slam a door

24
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:17,105
when you can
pull it closed.
But we're just playing.

25
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:20,203
Well, play right, Shawn,
or don't play at all.

26
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:29,018
Shawn,

27
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:32,022
(WHISPERING) he's not in here.

28
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:42,896
CARLTON: I don't need to
tell you how vital it is

29
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:45,631
that we maintain
the utmost secrecy
on this heist.

30
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:48,105
The Attorney General
does not want his son's
wedding disrupted

31
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:49,368
any more than
it's already been.

32
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,103
How will we explain
our presence to the press?

33
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:53,338
We don't.
Just let them stew.

34
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,243
Well, that's one approach.

35
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:59,649
But, if I may suggest, I once
wrote a paper regarding press
releases and such and...

36
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,915
Sorry, your idea sounds great.

37
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,486
(DOOR OPENS)

38
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,017
Get the board.

39
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,864
What are you doing?
Dude, I'm onto something big.

40
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,836
Tailing cops?
In a police station?

41
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,805
Some monumentally expensive
ring just got stolen.

42
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,466
I'm gonna get
us on the case.

43
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:23,804
We just got a case
five minutes ago.

44
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,402
Yeah, a lame one.
Stolen computers
from a high school.

45
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,879
Come on, like,
you were falling asleep
during that meeting.

46
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,323
This is an heirloom.
It's worth $5 million,

47
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:43,692
lifted from the hotel where
they're having the wedding.
Wedding's on Saturday.

48
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:46,454
(EXCLAIMS)
There's an open bar.

49
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,093
Dude, we're so there.
Are we looking
at the same thing?

50
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,572
I told you to wait
in my office.
I had a premonition.

51
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,940
Something sparkly.
Just over five karats,

52
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,672
perfect clarity,
slight inclusion.

53
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,611
Is this ringing
any bells for you?

54
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:05,016
Solve the case I gave you.
Then we'll talk.

55
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,787
In the meantime,
I have a lot of work
to complete.

56
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:10,955
It's the secretary.

57
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,022
Pardon?
The secretary.
The secretary did it.

58
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,425
Now, what can you
tell me about the ring
I'm envisioning?

59
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,088
But you barely even
looked at this folder.

60
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,688
It's in the papers.
Where?

61
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,427
The signatures,
it's in her handwriting.

62
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:25,198
Look, she's faking her
own signature, and later
there's evidence that it's...

63
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:33,171
I feel it in the ink.

64
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,110
Very bad vibes.

65
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:39,743
Strong squidish vibes.

66
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:44,087
We'll check it out.
Until then, I trust you
can find the door.

67
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,284
But what about the ring?
Not until this one is done.

68
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,229
Hey, let me gather some
information, all right?
Make a little headway.

69
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,098
Then I'll have a psychic
episode that blows the
ears right off their skulls.

70
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,637
Shawn, I'm in
meetings all day.

71
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:02,197
I barely had time to come
down for this. We're doing
what the Chief says. Period.

72
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,588
SHAWN: So sorry to have
kept you waiting.

73
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,318
I am Shawn Spencer,
chief psychic here
at the department.

74
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:24,363
Thank you so much for helping.
This whole thing
has been devastating.

75
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,295
My hands are still shaking.

76
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:29,062
You're doing fine.
Okay, I only have a second.

77
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:31,399
I'll need you to tell me
everything I have to
know about this case

78
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,302
as quickly as humanly
possible, okay?

79
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,409
What about this guy?
What's going on
with the best man?

80
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,536
I don't know,
he's not answering
his phone or his door.

81
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,773
DYLAN: This day
has just been
completely unreal.

82
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,146
Guys, it's going to be fine.

83
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,048
You're in good hands.
I have never failed a case.

84
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,883
I know who you are.
I read about you in the paper.

85
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:53,720
You did?

86
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:59,423
You're the sister
of the groom.

87
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,805
And the maid of honor.

88
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,833
And the wedding planner?
Correct.

89
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:14,243
That is so many hats.
You should see my closet.

90
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,713
I am hoping to.

91
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:17,911
But not until
I find this ring.

92
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,851
Well, the wedding's tomorrow.
How fast are you?

93
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,081
That depends entirely on
how much cooperation
I receive.

94
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,384
Why don't you come
to the wedding?

95
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:27,085
Yeah. No, no,
I couldn't possibly
impose on you. No.

96
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,390
Please, you're
saving us here.

97
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,159
You find this ring,
we'd owe you everything.

98
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:36,426
What in the hell
is going on here?

99
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,436
I just dropped by
to say hello.

100
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:42,497
Guys, this is head detective
Carlton Lassiter and his
lovely new partner, Juliet.

101
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:45,840
His last one turned out
to be his girlfriend,
so she was transferred.

102
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,273
I'm not sure if that was
the only reason. I'll let you
decide for yourselves.

103
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,748
Shall we?
Sure.

104
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,645
If this is some sort of hazing
ritual, where we're gonna end
up naked in a river somewhere,

105
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,351
I'll need to arrange
for a ride home.

106
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,516
Listen to me, Spencer.

107
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:04,154
The department's
reputation is on the
line with this one.

108
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:08,667
If I catch you anywhere near
this case, I will throw every
book I can find at you.

109
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,694
What if you find the Bible?
You going to throw that, too?

110
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:15,472
Seems a little sacrilegious
to me, don't you think?

111
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,612
Ow.

CARLTON: I am right on
schedule, sir.

I've booked myself a suite
to use as a command center.

135
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,400
I'll stay the night
if I have to.
Keep an eye on things.

136

for that, is it?

No?

138
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,866
That ring has been
in my family
for 200 years.

139
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,843
My mother agonized over
the decision to give
it to my son.

140
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:00,139
I'm not letting it
get away now.

141
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,613
Sir, we are checking
every person who came
through that door.

Every employee.
Every guest.

Nobody checks
out of this hotel

144
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,550
until we're just short
of going through every
piece of their luggage.

145

No, you're not.

00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:24,730
Can I help you, sir?

148
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,435
I'm just

149
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:30,337
listening.

150
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,110
For what?
For what?

151
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,743
Lyme disease.
Lyme disease?

152
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,551
Lyme disease, rickets,
avitaminosis, Legionnaire's,
bubonic. You name it.

153
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,592
I want you to
listen to something.

154
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:47,717
Do you hear that?
Mmm-hmm.

155
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:48,919
We have spores in the wall.

156
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:50,724
Spores?
You know
where else they are?

157
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:54,960
In the planter. You know
where else? Everywhere
in the entire hotel.

158
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:58,231
Who called you? Mike?

159
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,329
Mike? Is this
a big joke to you?

160
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:03,874
I don't answer to Mike.
Have you seen Mike lately?
Mike can kiss my ass.

161
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,975
I was called in by
the state inspector himself.

162
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,536
Are you at all aware
how dangerous this is?
Hell, yes, I am!

163
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:09,774
Good. I'm glad.

164
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,976
I need access to
this whole place,
elevator shafts, air vents,

165
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:13,278
the safe room, obviously.

166
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:14,614
The safe room
is a crime scene.

167
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,917
This eucalyptus
will be dead by lunch.

168
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:21,016
The safe room will be
a triage unit if I don't get
those spores out of there.

169
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:25,196
Understood.
Can we let the cops finish
up in there first?

170
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,422
Tell them to hurry.

171
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,728
Oh, man.

172
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,498
(SNIFFS)

173
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,638
Thirteen minutes after
midnight, members
of the wedding party

174
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,703
enter the safe room,
placing the ring
into a safety deposit box,

175
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,682
which was slid into the safe
and closed for the night.

176
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,275
No sensors indicate
that either the safe door

177
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:50,151
or the lock box
was opened again
until the following morning.

178
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:55,359
Please note, he has activated
the time lock, which prevents
the safe from opening.

179
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:59,027
No one walks into
that room again
until the following morning,

180
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,827
when the ring is
discovered missing.

181
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,528
So it definitely didn't
disappear during the night?

182
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,002
Or so they would
like you to think.

183
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:09,098
However, if you look
closely, there are nine
glitches on this tape.

184
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,574
I'm sorry, glitches?

185
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,440
Seams, static bursts
in the image.

186
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:16,607
Someone could have tapped in
an alternate video feed of
this room while it was empty.

187
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,583
Or, more likely,
as I believe,

188
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,147
someone built a scale
replica of this room.

189
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,217
(MAN LAUGHS)

190
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,957
Who laughed?

191
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:30,959
Nobody?

192
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:34,925
(MAN LAUGHS)

193
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:37,492
If somebody disagrees
with my theory,
I'd like to know.

194
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,368
It does seem
very elaborate.

195
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,574
And just a bit far-fetched.

196
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,008
Are you a detective?
Why are you here?

197
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,571
BUZZ: You asked for
all of us to come.

198
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:51,405
Oh, well, Officer,
since you're such
an expert on fetching,

199
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,480
why don't you fetch
me a cup of coffee?

200
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:54,678
(LAUGHS)

201
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,358
Moving on.

202
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:06,523
All the employee alibis
check out. Except this one.

203
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,259
Dietrich Mannheim.

204
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,892
Currently
the facilities manager.

205
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,869
You may remember him
from the security video.

206
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:15,737
He was in the room
when the ring was placed
into the safety deposit box.

207
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,774
During questioning,
he was nervous, evasive,

208
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,812
and contradicted himself
more than once.

209
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,213
His work computer history
reveals that he recently
visited websites

210
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:29,414
for boats and expensive
cars, and he failed to
show up for work.

211
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,088
Questions?

212
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,016
Is this your only lead?

213
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:39,895
His responses
to my interrogation
were hostile at best.

214
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:41,828
Clarify "hostile".

215
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,597
Use my tone now as a guide.

216
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,217
Detective O'Hara,
all alone?

217
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,424
Well, not anymore, apparently.

218
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,320
Work troubles?

219
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,458
I'm sensing work troubles.

220
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,959
Here, let me read your palm.

221
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,368
How about just one finger?

222
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,235
Come, now, let me see
if I can be helpful.

223
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,104
Why are you here?

224
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:24,870
The Maxwell wedding.

225
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,440
Honestly. I was invited.

226
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:28,605
By whom?

227
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,774
Beth. Bethany. The bride.

228
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:34,612
Little baby B.
The B sting. Love her.

229
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,484
God, Dylan is so
lucky to have her.

230
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:39,718
She grounds him in ways
that he needed grounding,
don't you think?

231
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,428
She's a good sport.

232
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,492
Air Supply, really?

233
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:52,764
Kidding. Just kidding.
Relax.

234
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,173
This is work-related.

235
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,446
You thought this place
would be different,

236
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:05,475
but nobody respects
your opinions.

237
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,685
They all think
you're too young?

238
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,222
Always.

239
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,552
Always.

240
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,329
You know, I think
you and I could
help each other.

241
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:19,523
And how would that be?

242
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:23,295
Oh, I know things.
Things about rings.

243
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,735
Oh. I thought you were
here for a wedding.

244
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,399
I am... ish.

245
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,542
You first.

246
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:47,855
(STAMMERING)
I just got a message for you,
Mr. Guster, and,

247
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,986
well, I'm afraid
it's about your cat.

248
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,088
My cat?

249
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,327
The poor thing is in
the animal hospital.
They think her leg is broken.

250
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,232
I'll get down there later.

251
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,600
You're not going?

252
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,138
I'm very busy.

253
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:03,835
But your cat needs you for
moral support. The vet said
it could be the difference.

254
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,137
Later.

255
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,235
You have to go.

256
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,177
Mr. Guster, I know
that you're in shock.

257
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,340
Don't do anything you're
going to regret forever.

258
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,008
I don't even...
He's not going?

259
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,419
Oh.

260
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,855
So, now I have a cat?

261
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:30,424
An orange tabby. Last
Christmas, you made her a tiny
Santa hat. It was adorable.

262
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,493
Fantastic.
I can't even have a
make-believe boy cat.

263
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:35,199
Gus, a boy cat wouldn't
serve my purposes
nearly as well.

264
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,868
The next time I need you,
Pickles is having kittens.

265
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:40,377
Pickles?
Mrs. Pickles is her full name.

266
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,914
Though, I'm not
actually sure cats can
marry outside of Boston.

267
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,609
Yeah, well,
in a related issue,

268
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:47,117
I'm blocking your number
on all the phones
in the office.

269
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,120
If you think that will work,
I think it's endearing.

270
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,281
In the meantime, aren't you
the least bit curious

271
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:54,292
about who was there
when they put the ring
in the hotel safe?

272
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,918
Wait a minute.

273
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,561
This is a safecracking case?

274
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,258
Did I forget to mention that?

275
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,395
What kind of safe?

276
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,405
The Hydra 700.

277
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:08,906
The 700 is out?

278
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,304
That's impossible,
nobody could crack that.

279
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,812
I haven't even told you about
the wall sensors.

280
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,172
Can we be done by 3:00?

281
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,076
Yes.

282
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:27,016
The safe room,
right behind that door.

283
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:32,092
What is all this?
I thought this was
a safe job.

284
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:35,930
Oh, Lassiter
has this insane idea that this
in an elaborate heist, right?

285
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,993
Like on par
with <i>Ocean's Eleven,</i>
or <i>Thomas Crown,</i>

286
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,596
or... Oh, the one
where they kill
Donald Sutherland

287
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,869
in the first ten minutes,
remake...

288
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,537
Mr. Spencer, Mr. Guster,
what a surprise.

289
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,104
Chief. Looking good.
You're probably
wondering...

290
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:53,879
I sent an officer down to the
high school to take a look
at your secretary suspect.

291
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,946
She cracked.
He didn't even get
the first question out.

292
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,217
Really?

293
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:03,020
'Cause I envisioned
that being harder.

294
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:06,292
Yet I don't recall
asking you to come down
here to the De La Cruz.

295
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,055
Well, we have
reason to believe

296
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,067
this case goes in
a completely
different direction.

297
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,227
Huh.

298
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,567
Let me be perfectly clear.

299
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,807
I didn't see you
and we didn't talk.

300
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,810
Call me if you have something.

301
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,846
I love her.
Yeah.

302
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,359
He knows you?

303
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:45,096
I had to lay some groundwork.
He doesn't believe in
psychics. This is plan B.

304
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,660
Chief Inspector Shawn,
how are you?

305
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,366
(SHUSHING) I'm undercover.

306
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,305
Not even the
American police know
I'm in on this.

307
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,968
(STAMMERING) I'm sorry.
I blew it again, didn't I?

308
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,602
And after you brought
me into your confidence.

309
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,375
Bobby, it's fine.
Believe me.

310
00:16:56,448 --> 00:17:00,111
These other Interpol guys
are very appreciative
of what you're doing here.

311
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,447
<i>(RULE BRITANNIA</i> PLAYING)
How long will you need?

312
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,715
Just as discussed,
five minutes, tops.

313
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,247
You're my man.

314
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:12,825
Interpol?

315
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,490
That's right.
Missing Ring Division.

316
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:17,467
I believe I was recruited
out of North Africa
when I was 15.

317
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,901
You could at least
use a British accent.

318
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,166
(IN BRITISH ACCENT) Oh,
please, Gus, I started with
a British accent,

319
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,300
and then seamlessly
slipped into my
fake American one.

320
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,500
Bobby gave me
some pointers.

321
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:29,046
Apparently you Americans
say "howdy" a lot.

322
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,376
Howdy.

323
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,214
What are you doing?

324
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:38,654
List. List. I made a list of
suspects after attending
Lassiter's briefing.

325
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,884
He let you in his briefing?

326
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,051
(LAUGHS) He does when
you're in the airshaft.

327
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,286
All your suspects
are in the
wedding party?

328
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,661
Look, the only ones who
knew they put
that ring in the safe

329
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,858
were at the rehearsal dinner.

330
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:50,094
So, it was an inside job?
Looking like it.

331
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:52,898
GUS: You're making keys?

332
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,734
Gus, how else
do you expect me
to get in the rooms?

333
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:55,933
Shawn, you can't do that.

334
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,703
Of course I can,
I worked at the
Hampton Inn

335
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,835
for that three-day weekend
in Austin when we were 19.

336
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,107
I know you remember that.
Gus, this is so easy.

337
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,478
Try making a key.

338
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,223
Dude, I rule.

339
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:13,784
Nope. Innocent.
Let's move.

340
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,850
What are you talking about?
We haven't even
stepped foot in there.

341
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,158
Gus, do you need
the remedial course, really?

342
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,859
Uncle Leo left
his wallet on the table.

343
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,830
Criminals are sneaky,
jaded, suspicious people.

344
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,702
They're smart
and defensive.

345
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,674
This guy has a reason
to be trusting.

346
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,366
Can we go now?

Guys, hey,
your door was open.

350
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:43,714
Oh, it was?

351
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,953
Yes, and I was worried that
something horrible
had happened. You're okay?

352
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:49,391
Yeah, yeah.

353
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,587
(LAUGHS)

354
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,857
I told you we didn't have to
come in here. They're fine.

355
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:55,525
Everybody's fine.
This is my associate, Gus.

356
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,466
Just call him Peter Panic.

357
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,167
How are you doing?

358
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:00,762
So, you're a psychic, too?

359
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,932
Well...
Gus here is
a safe expert.

Yes, he subscribes to

362
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:14,546
It's an online magazine.
And it's a trade publication.

363
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:20,423
Excuse me for saying so,
but how exactly do you figure
into this legal family?

364
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,819
I started my
criminal law degree.

365
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:29,061
Then I came to my senses,
went to Europe, painted,
slept, ate, sank a boat.

367
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,160
Disappointed?
Besotted.

368
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,563
We'd like to speak
to the best man,
if possible.

369
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,039
So would we.

370
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,606
Any ideas where he is?

371
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,803
We haven't seen him
since the night of
the sixth.

372
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,573
Which is the night
the ring disappeared.

373
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,239
The florist quit.

374
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,078
So, after we dropped
the ring off at the safe,

375
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,550
we had to wrap bouquets
all night in our suite.

376
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,087
Everybody except Jack.
Do you think he's a suspect?

377
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,089
No, we just
think he's lazy.

378
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,156
DYLAN: Hey, Dad,
this is Shawn Spencer.

379
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,289
He's the psychic
I told you about.

380
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,290
I know. Let's talk.

381
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:05,634
Son, I'm very comfortable with
the current direction
of the investigation.

382
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,865
So, let's let the real
police department
do their job.

383
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,067
Sir, believe me,
I am only here to help.

384
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,578
In fact, I was actually
hoping to discuss...

385
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,044
I'm glad you understand.

386
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,315
The guy shook my hand like
I stole something.

387
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:27,017
You see?
That's why I can't
do this job alone.

389
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,132
Wow. That is about
as orange as you can get.

390
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,298
Which suspect's
room is this?
Lassiter's.

391
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,895
The head detective?
He has his own room?

392
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,406
Perhaps paid
for by the city.

393
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:45,170
No. No. This is
going too far.
We're not staying.

394
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,439
Gus, we need these
witness statements.

395
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:50,845
It's not exactly like
we're being overwhelmed
with cooperation here.

396
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,918
Oh, Lacey.

397
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,715
Lacey, you can
sink my boat.

398
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,156
Toss me the remote.

The Attorney General
has an insurance policy

He'll collect a cool

6:00 tonight.

Please don't tell anyone.

Thanks. 6:00, huh?

yes, there is.

is to know about this.
They've been through enough.

502
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,546
Yes, sir.

503
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:58,355
MAXWELL: So, this is it.

504
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:01,558
Well, that ought to keep
them busy for a while.

505
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,121
Can we at least watch
the tape in another room
besides Lassiter's?

506
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:10,394
Gus, he's not coming back.
Are you sure
about that?

507
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,265
Yes, didn't you
check his messages?

508
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,696
Are you gonna
have some cookies?
No.

509
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,001
Do you wanna finish
my banana?

510
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,405
I want to leave.

511
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:25,143
SHAWN: Look at the best man.
He's smashed.

512
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,643
And look at his hair.
It's horrible.

513
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:36,351
That's it?

514
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,328
We have to watch it again.

515

It's open?
What are you doing?

518
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,399
Oh, what am I early?

519
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,233
Big Dyl,
you're right on time.

520
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:52,900
Did I forget to mention
that we're hosting
the bachelor party?

521
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:58,807
No, thank you.

522
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:02,148
He says, "Uh-oh.
I thought you said you wanted
it inside the piñata."

Eat. Eat like men.

525
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:09,322
You're really mad?

526
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:11,259
We have less than 12
hours to solve the case,

527
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:13,797
and you're throwing
a kegger in a police
officer's room.

528
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:15,025
Why would I be mad?

529
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,501
Gus, his best man was
a total washout, he wasn't
gonna plan anything.

530
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,562
We have to dig information
out of suspects,
and you're wasting time.

531
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,532
Dylan!

532
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,239
Dude. You, wow!

533
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,438
Yes, wow!

534
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:32,144
Gus here has some
questions for you,
you flaxen-haired Argonaut.

535
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:35,380
Anything for you two.
I love you guys.

536
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,281
I've found that they're
particularly forthcoming

537
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:40,051
with information
while in this state.

538
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:43,219
For example, I've
eliminated every
suspect here.

539
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:45,653
Although there is
a guy stealing cable

540
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,062
and another refilling
his minibar bottles
with shampoo,

541
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:51,660
but I don't think
those are gateway crimes
to a jewelry heist.

542
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:55,704
Seriously. Gus, come on,
give me a kiss.

543
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:59,073
No, no, nothing weird,
on my cheek.

544
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,071
Get me out of here.
I think it's
your turn to dig.

545
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:05,677
Do you know
who stole the ring?

546
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,183
No.

547
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,950
And to be honest,
I don't care.

548
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,955
I didn't even want
the damn thing.

549
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:15,990
Okay. The night
that we announced
our engagement, no,

550
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:19,989
my Dad stops dinner right
in the middle of my speech.

551
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:26,098
So, he goes and gets
my grandmother's ring.

552
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,866
What am I supposed
to say? No?

553
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,408
So, now it's not about us,
it's about him again.

554
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:34,343
I mean, forget that
I just chose the person

555
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:36,642
that I wanna spend
the rest of my life with.

556
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,350
I don't wanna seem ungrateful,

557
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,712
but if it were up to me,

558
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:48,492
I'd sooner just stop looking.

559
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:51,184
Cross him off.

560
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,592
Dylan, how is Dad?

561
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:58,602
I mean, financially,
would you say everything is...

Okay.

564
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,799
So much for that.

565
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,045
Dylan was the only
shot we had in this
room, but that's okay.

566
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:10,574
We have other suspects
in this hotel.

567

you guys here.

You got anything?
These girls
are not criminals.

574
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:31,928
It was worth a shot.

575
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,632
You wanna get out of here?

576
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,198
Yes, I do.

So, how are you
holding up?
I'm good.

578

My dad brought in all
this extra security
for some reason.

579
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:52,651
Can he afford that?
What do you mean?

580
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:55,693
I don't know, it's just... It
was a tough year financially
for a lot of people...

getting at?

you get that from?

underestimate me,
or my wardrobe.

remove...

about five minutes.
