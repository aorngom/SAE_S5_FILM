What the heck
is going on here?

14
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,057
Mr. Spencer, your
son's been cheating.

00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:34,066
Have not!
Are, too! You hit
my ships every time.

Both of you,
on your feet, now.

Best friends do not accuse
each other of cheating.

to fighting every time
they have an argument.

that I have a partner

BOTH: Yes, sir.

21
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:50,347
Well, we couldn't do our job
if we didn't trust each other
completely.

22
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:52,275
There are rules
to a partnership,

23
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:54,115
and they are the same rules
for a friendship.

for a tournament
but she never showed up.

You're not
wearing a watch.
That's a good point.

00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:58,468
This is from somebody else.
Somebody who's not loaded.

175
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,440
This is an eternity ring.
You're supposed to wear this
all the time.

176
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:04,449
And it's usually
given to you by someone,
you know, intimate.

177
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,178
Why do you know that?

178
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,083
I gave one to Jessica Chan.

179
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,884
Ah, yes, Jessica Chan.

180
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,925
And how long was eternity
for the two of you?

181
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,892
Three months.
But they were awesome months.

182
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,258
Except for the end part.

183
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,853
Right. I've never
seen a girl lie

184
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,625
about entering
the Witness
Protection Program.

185
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,564
She wasn't lying, Shawn!
Gus, I saw her at Starbucks!

186
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:22,658
You can't be sure of that.

187
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:26,068
She was wearing a nametag.
She had a plaque on the wall.

188
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:29,539
"Employee of the Month."
Her hobbies were hiding
and lying about hiding.

189
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:31,776
Fine. Whatever. Drop it.

190
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,904
My point is,
why isn't Deanna wearing hers
all the time?

191
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,950
She clearly has someone
daddy doesn't approve of.

192
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,077
We find the mystery lover,
we find her.

193
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:46,686
Dude, why don't I ever
get to say stuff like that?

194
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,826
CARLTON: All right.
Get her down to the station
and take her statement.

195
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,694
Nail down the last time
she saw Deanna.

196
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,494
I'm on my way in now.

197
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:58,799
I am sensing
you're drinking
a nonfat vanilla,

198
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:03,171
half caf with lots of
whipped cream but without
your usual pink straw.

199
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,971
What, are you two
stalking me now?

200
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,944
Or did you come to tell me
where the missing girl is?

201
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,071
No.

202
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:11,841
But I did divine
that Deanna has
a secret boyfriend,

203
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,579
which sounds
like a lead to me.

204
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,678
Yeah, we're looking into
all her relationships.

205
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,814
But, you see, it's my job
to investigate people

206
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,326
with things like, you know,
motive, means and opportunity.

207
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,222
Stop following me.

208
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,257
(TISKING)
What did I say?

209
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:29,267
Look, man, I've been meaning
to have the same conversation
with you about leading me.

210
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:30,833
To be honest,
I'm sick of it.

211
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,666
We either walk
side by side,
or not at all.

212
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,171
(HORN HONKING)

213
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,007
Shawn, six months ago
I called you up

214
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,105
to ask you whether or not
you wanted any of this junk.

215
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:44,843
How come you only call me
to come pick up stuff?

216
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,147
You didn't listen,
now I'm donating
all of it to Goodwill.

217
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:48,413
I'm on my way there
right now,

218
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,819
so you got about 30 seconds,
last looks.

219
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,586
(PROTESTING)
No, no, no.

220
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:56,492
You cannot throw out
my Whitesnake T-shirt.

221
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,587
You can't get this
in stores anymore.

222
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,029
That is...

223
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,757
This is my
<i>Airwolf</i> windbreaker.

224
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,802
I've been looking for this
for like five years now.

225
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,894
Why did you take this?
I never even saw you
wear it.

226
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,372
Of course I didn't wear it.
I took it, so you wouldn't.

227
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:10,365
Don't put it on.

228
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:14,038
Gus, nobody had
an <i>Airwolf</i>jacket
except Jan-Michael Vincent.

229
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,205
(EXCLAIMS)

230
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,283
This looks like
a custom Sak-Hart
graphite rod and reel.

231
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,114
That's right. Good eye.

232
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:21,551
You can't throw
something like this away.

233
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,849
It's 15 years old.

234
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,082
Fifteen? Looks brand-new.

235
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,522
Oh, that's because
it's never been used.

236
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,287
Bought it for him.

237
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,989
Man, I have been itching
to get out on the blue
and hook some snapper,

238
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,054
but you know what a chore
it is to get the boat and...

239
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,100
You're welcome to come
with me tomorrow morning.

240
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,431
Boat leaves
at 5:00 a.m. Sharp.

241
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:40,836
Princess here,
never could get him up.

242
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:44,967
Look, the American Medical
Association clearly states
the proper amount of sleep...

243
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,808
Well, if you're sure
you don't mind
a little company?

244
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,814
If you're sure
you can be there at 5:00 a.m.

245
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:52,077
I'll be on the docks
at <i>4</i>:15 a.m.

246
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,379
Spencer.

247
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,752
What just
happened here?

248
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,689
I think
your dad just made
his first play-date.

249
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,920
(LAUGHING)

250
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,791
It's not funny.
It is.

251
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:08,857
He gave away my custom
something something pole.
I loved that thing.

252
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:10,699
You gonna get it back?

253
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,399
No. We are going to
the Vista Rico Health
and Racquet club.

254
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,338
Now's not the time
for a steam, Shawn.

255
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,274
Gus, Deanna was seen
practicing there

256
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,538
the morning she disappeared.

257
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,376
If she's some sort of
tennis star, she probably
goes there a lot.

258
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,383
Maybe someone saw her
with her mystery lover!

259
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,909
How did that sound?

260
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,045
It feels like
you're pushing.
You're pressing.

261
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,017
(GROANS)

262
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,660
GUS: Deanna's coach
is in Tokyo,

263
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,595
but the manager said
this girl was here practicing
the last time Deanna was.

264
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:39,926
Sweet.

265
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,467
Excuse me,
can we talk to you
for a second?

266
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,163
I only have 11 minutes
left to practice.

267
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:48,229
Yeah, but isn't it better
if someone's over there
to return your serve?

268
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:51,743
You play?
No, but this is
Vernest Lambert Watkins.

269
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,908
He was a junior champion
of some junior league.

270
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,040
What did you guys
call yourselves?
The Little Green Fuzzymen?

271
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,813
The Yellow Hornets.
But that was like
10 years ago.

272
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,514
He'll give you a workout.
We're just gonna have a chat.

273
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:04,954
Racket's over here?

274
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:10,794
Now, I can sense
that you were here
the day Deanna disappeared.

275
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:14,594
Duh. Everybody knows
we hit together.
What are you, a genius?

276
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,096
Actually,
I'm a psychic.

277
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,638
And I don't think
I like your tone.

278
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:32,614
Let me rephrase that,
and don't read anything
into my tone,

279
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,916
why do you think
she didn't show up to
that tournament in Tokyo?

280
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:39,350
Out.

281
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,052
Out? Out my ass!

282
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,152
You can't be serious.
That ball was clearly
on the line!

283
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,821
Long. Long by
a hair, buddy.

284
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,262
(GRUNTS)

285
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:48,625
Any ideas?

286
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,692
You know what
her weakness was?

287
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,896
Kittens?

288
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,701
Focus. All she thought
about was boys.

289
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:57,707
(GRUNTING)

290
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:01,874
Cowboy up there, buddy.

291
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,312
Shut up.

292
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,380
Any boys in particular?

293
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,850
She was not particular
at all.

294
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,183
But I heard
she started hanging out
with that Doug Lenmar.

295
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:12,281
Doug Lenmar? He's one of
the top-ranked players
on the men's tour.

296
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,053
He stinks. No net game.

297
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,118
Her father totally freaked
when he found out
and told her to end it.

298
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:20,063
Then she tried to be
all rebellious and
stormed off the court.

299
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,123
How grody of her.

300
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,566
(GRUNTING)

301
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,997
Grody?
Grody to the max?

302
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,134
Grody with a spoon.

303
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:32,173
Come on, work with me.
I don't know what the kids
are saying these days.

304
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,370
I don't remember anything
else. That's all I heard.

305
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,173
Well, you hear a lot.

306
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,911
Coaches are more gossipy
than housewives.

307
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,953
Just watch. In five years,

308
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:45,081
she'll be knocked up
and living in government
assisted housing.

309
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:48,149
It's good to see
the game hasn't hardened you.

310
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,588
Out!

311
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,859
Okay, so we know
she had a secret boyfriend,
Doug Lenmar.

312
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:55,423
But if he was in Tokyo,
why would she go to see him?

313
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,469
Let's find out
if he really is in Tokyo.

314
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:00,266
If so, plan B.
She was boy-crazy.

315
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,102
There's got to be more
than one dude in the mix.

316
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,608
Maybe she's not missing.
Maybe she's hiding.

317
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,874
To keep her dad off her case.
But where would she hide?

318
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,244
Ooh.
What?

319
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:14,077
I have the urge
to suddenly
get my bunions buffed.

320
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:20,254
Shawn, this is
completely unnecessary.

321
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,351
(WHISPERING) Deanna was here.
We have to retrace her steps.

322
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,793
In a paraffin wax dip?

323
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,330
You know how flaky
my knuckles get.

324
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:28,093
Two birds, one stone.
I've never felt so productive.

325
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,067
And exactly
how much information
do you plan on getting

326
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,103
from a manicurist
that can't speak English?

327
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,638
None so far.

328
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,934
Hold on.

329
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:39,942
Dude.

330
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:47,747
Hurry up!

331
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,086
(EXCLAIMS)
She was here yesterday.

332
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:52,316
Check that out.

333
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,450
Gus, you're gonna
smudge my gloss.

334
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,054
She ordered
nail protein solution.

335
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,495
So she has weak,
peeling nails.

336
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,999
No, genius.
The billing address
is her father's place,

337
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,093
but the delivery address
is someplace else.

338
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,070
Nice focus, Gus.
Thank you.

339
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,768
Maybe you're ready
to take on that
little girl again.

340
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,972
Gus, I feel good
about this.

341
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:18,447
She's gonna be here.
Safe and sound.

342
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,076
<i>(POLICE RADIO CHATTERING)</i>

343
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:24,783
Or not.

344
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:34,363
All right,
I want to talk to her
the minute she wakes up.

345
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,193
If she wakes up.

346
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:38,861
What happened here?

347
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,566
This isn't a missing
person case any more.

348
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,937
It's attempted murder.

349
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:47,610
Man, even she gets
to say stuff like that.

350
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:06,955
That's more crappy jewelry.

351
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,660
That means the working-class
boyfriend has been here.

352
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,362
Hey, aren't you
Henry Spencer's kid?

353
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:12,665
That I am.

354
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,332
I took a six-week course
he taught at the academy.

355
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,272
Lucky you. How was he?

356
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,247
Yeah, that just
about sums it up.

357
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,077
Do you mind if we
poke around a little?

358
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,207
No.

359
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:28,452
We do. We mind
quite a bit actually.

360
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,852
You know what,
scratch that.

361
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:33,357
I'm gonna let you guys
stick around to see
what real detectives do.

362
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:36,155
Sweet! Just let us know
when they arrive.

363
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,229
Deanna shared this place
with another player
on the tour,

364
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,061
so her name wasn't
on the lease.

365
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,658
But Lassiter found
one of her close friends.

366
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,330
Apparently, they met
frequently at that
Indian restaurant.

367
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,100
We canvassed the area
with her photo

368
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,936
and the owner of this building
recognized her.

369
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,671
So we opened the door
and <i>voilà.</i>
<i>Voilà.</i>

370
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:55,077
O'Hara, come
take a look at this.

371
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,881
Check this out.

372
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,791
I think
these were all taken
inside this apartment.

373
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,522
I think you're right.

374
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,799
Wait a second.
What?

375
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:25,735
I see something!

376
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,142
I see a trophy.

377
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,046
But I'm out of place.

378
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,946
I've been kidnapped.

379
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,218
There is a trophy
missing from here.

380
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,281
And we know she suffered
a blunt force trauma.

381
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,623
Possibly the weapon.
Good work, O'Hara.

382
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,389
O'Hara? That was all us!

383
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,330
I think
your tutorial in police work
is done now. Goodbye.

384
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:00,137
It's cool. I've got
everything we need.

385
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,383
Deanna is listed as critical
but stable for now.

386
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,353
She's touch and go
for the next <i>4</i>8 hours.

387
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,719
<i>MAN ON TV:</i>
<i>... 50 pounds and is considered</i>
<i>to be armed and dangerous.</i>

388
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,054
<i>Anyone with information</i>
<i>as to the whereabouts</i>
<i>of this man...</i>

389
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:15,252
Gosh!

390
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,192
Finding Deanna lit a fire
under the department.

391
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,890
Lassiter's been having
these advisory alerts
run 2<i>4l</i>7.

392
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,432
So let me
get this straight.

393
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,560
Their theory is that
Felix followed her
to her hideaway,

394
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,263
and showed his love
by trying to kill her?

395
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:27,805
Not a terrible theory.

396
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:29,941
Let's review, shall we?

397
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:31,942
No forced entry.

398
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,444
That means she either
let the attacker in
or he had a key.

399
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,413
Sounds like someone
she was intimate with.

400
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:39,144
Now, the toilet seat
in her apartment was up.

401
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,049
So we know there was
a guy there recently.

402
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,384
I doubt
the killer stopped to use
the little boy's room,

403
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,754
so let's assume
the phantom boyfriend
stopped by for a matinee.

404
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,661
And there were
two wine glasses
missing from her set.

405
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:53,390
So she probably
shared a drink with him,
and he grabbed the glasses

406
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:57,868
which had
his fingerprints on them
as he beat a discreet retreat.

407
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,469
None of that points to Felix.

408
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:04,839
I gotta get back to work.

409
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,343
Now?
You're gonna leave now?

410
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:07,810
When we're up to our necks
in intrigue?

411
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,212
The case is almost closed.
We have the girl,
she's still alive.

412
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,749
The cops beat us.
Let them have this one.

413
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,943
How can you be so negative?

414
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:14,849
Easy. I need face time
with my boss.

415
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,785
I already missed
the pamper pole
trust exercise.

416
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:19,153
I'm uncomfortable
with you even saying
the words "pamper pole".

417
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,556
Look, every minute
the cops spend
looking for Felix,

418
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,322
the real attacker
breathes easier.

419
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:26,228
Now we have got
to convince them to start
looking for other suspects.

420
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:27,424
No.

421
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,865
Unless you can give us
something more substantial,
Mr. Spencer,

422
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,403
we're gonna continue
the manhunt
for Felix Alvarez.

423
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,330
Manhunt?
Mmm-hmm.

424
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:36,772
Hey, I can project
Tommy Lee Jones
from <i>The Fugitive</i>

425
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:37,866
if you'd like.

426

430
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,747
It's about time.
Were you on a break?

431
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,787
(EXCLAIMS) Hey!

432
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,148
Dad?

433
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,017
Now what?

434
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,561
I just stopped by
to drop off this hat
for Mr. Lassiter,

435
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:00,655
so he can look the part
next time we go out and
catch us some snapper.

436
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:01,756
Thanks.

437
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,097
The next time
you go out and...

438
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,098
(STAMMERS)
Isn't that my hat?

439
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:07,399
What are you doing here?

440
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,337
Oh, you know,
just interrupting
an official briefing,

441
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:10,898
and being in general,
pain in my ass.

442
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:13,240
Oh, well,
try living with him
for 17 years.

443
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:14,677
(MOCKING)

444
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:17,510
Excuse me. I have
a killer to catch.

445
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:21,281
Good luck with that.

446
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:24,477
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

447
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,285
And time!

448
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:28,052
Nicely done.

449
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:31,785
Excuse me a second.

450
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,255
What're you doing here?

451
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,765
Dude, you turned off
your cell phone.

452
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,767
Some might take that
as a hint. As in,
"Leave me alone."

453
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:39,235
Burton, you're not
having visitors,
are you?

454
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:40,771
You know my policy
on visitors.

455
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,773
He's not a visitor...
Jerry Hathaway.

456
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:45,207
I too work at Central Coast.
In the lab.

457
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,843
Yes, I worked on
the mono-thio-Huxtable
drug.

458
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,849
It's for pancake-
reactic function.

459
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:52,975
Pancreatic.

460
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:55,849
Actually, no, Burton.
It was pancake.
Really?

461
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,389
Yes, there are
properties in the batter
that help to stabilize

462
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,015
the ions
we were working with.

463
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,389
I never heard
of that project.

464
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,087
It was a great drug.

465
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,994
But it caused headaches,
stomach aches, tooth aches,

466
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:10,228
weight gain,
weight loss, balding,
sever oily bowel discharge,

467
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,703
and in very rare cases
it made you pee fire.

468
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,966
Wow!

469
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,702
Yeah. So the higher-ups
shelved the project,

470
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,368
much to my chagrin.

471
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,170
I thought I knew
all the lab guys.

472
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:22,907
I'm surprised
we've never met before.

473
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:25,814
I don't make
much of an impact
on other human beings.

474
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,045
It's terrible
for my self esteem.

475
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,611
In fact, I've been here
all weekend,

476
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,657
and this is the first
conversation I've had.

477
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:36,786
And, Tom, you should know
that nobody made me a nametag.

478
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:40,463
You know what we say
about that here. Hello.

479
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,362
Hi, Tom.

480
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:47,438
No, I mean the motto
of the weekend. H-E-L-L-O.

481
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:50,270
Lop off the last letter
and you've got what
this weekend really is.

482
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:53,675
Stands for Health, Esteem,
Life, Love and Openness.

483
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,871
Well, that's
pretty keen, Tom.

484
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:59,110
You know,
in the spirit of openness,
I've always looked up to Gus.

485
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:00,879
He's everything
I wish I was.

486
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:03,352
Do you think maybe
we could work on
the next exercise together?

487
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:04,912
No, we can't do that.
Burton!

488
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,083
I believe your friend
is reaching out right now.

489
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,753
I think you two would be
perfect candidates
for the Minefield.

490
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,853
Burton, you have to
keep your eyes closed

491
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,921
while your friend
leads you through
a series of obstacles.

492
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,524
Oh, Tom! That sounds
really bitching!

493
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,265
Can I talk to him
alone for a second?
Sure!

494
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,330
Oh, great, thanks!
Oh, gosh.

495
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:23,704
Dude, I've got bad news.
What?

496
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:26,175
Deanna's doctors say
she showing signs
of improvement.

497
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:28,678
Shawn,
in the health care community,
we call that good news.

498
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,408
Given what we already know?

499
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,040
Did she know her attacker?
Yes.

500
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,950
Does that mean
when she wakes up
she can ID him?

501
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,250
She ID's him
and the case is closed.
Where's the downside?

502
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:38,482
Because if you're
the bad guy

503
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:41,025
and you know that
your victim could wake up
and point the finger at you...

504
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,618
(DRAMATICALLY)
He'll find her
and finish her off!

505
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,023
You're just not landing it.

506
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:47,188
The point is,

507
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,233
Deanna's life
is in danger now
more then ever,

508
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:50,768
and she needs us.

509
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,929
Burton, is there a problem?

510
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,336
Yes, Tom,
I'm afraid there is.

511
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:58,843
Burton's grandmother
just called.
She's broken her hip.

512
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,911
I thought you dealt
with that issue already.

513
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,776
The other side.
Tore the M.C.L.

514
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,975
She did it
while trying to do her
line dancing classes.

515
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,508
Why was an 87-year-old woman
with a broken hip attending
a line dancing class?

516
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,885
(CHUCKLES) Attending?
She was teaching it.

517
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,320
You leave
my grandson alone.
He's a good boy.

518
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,725
Oh, yeah.
Then why did he run
when he saw us coming?

519
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,854
Because you guys
got my face plastered
all over the TV

520
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,864
for something
I didn't do, man.
I'm innocent!

521
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:22,456
I don't even think
about her anymore.

522
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,331
Yeah, see, that's what
all the crazy stalkers say.

523
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,529
Stop!

524
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:28,939
Just... stop.

525
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:30,065
Hey, what the hell?

526
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:31,632
What are you doing?
Get your hand off him.

527
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,177
He's reading his guilt.
Give him a second.

528
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,544
Hamana, Hamana,
Hamana, Hamana,

529
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:41,416
Ricky, Enrique, Heraldo,
Menudo, Richie!

530
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:43,816
(GRUNTING)

531
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,152
This man is
true to his word.

532
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,229
He's pure of heart.

533
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:59,069
He made many mistakes
in his past.

534
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:02,538
Dirty, filthy mistake.

535
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,576
See,
I'm not telling you anything
you don't already know here.

536
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,512
But he didn't attack Deanna.

537
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:11,542
Really?

538
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:14,242
If he's so pure of heart,

539
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:18,153
why did we find the trophy
that she was nearly bludgeoned
to death with in his car?

540
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,017
(MOUTHING)

541
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:43,344
The raven crows
only at midnight,

542
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,781
dusk is for
the rooster's cackle.

543
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,410
What?

544
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,078
Jules, that's your cue
to cackle.

545
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,917
Shawn, I don't
have a cackle
in my repertoire.

546
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,286
What, you called for
this secret meeting.

547
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:54,222
We should use code-speak
in case people are listening?

548
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:57,625
(WHISPERS) It's not secret.
Just away from prying eyes.

549
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,027
So what do you propose?

550
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:01,190
Should we rent
one of those pedal boats
that looks like a swan?

551
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:04,633
We could, or you
could just take these.

552
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,662
What is this?

553
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:08,603
Copies of the files
on Felix Alvarez.

554
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,072
Why are you giving
this to me?

555
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:11,870
I've talked to the kid,
his grandmother

556
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:13,467
and the court-ordered
psychiatrist he had to see

557
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:14,876
after breaking
into Deanna's house.

558
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:18,143
They all say the months
of counseling paid off.
He was rehabilitated.

559
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:21,310
And he had a medical condition
that required dialysis.

560
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,680
My great-aunt
needed dialysis,

561
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:27,521
and she was always
knockdown-dragout,
winter-bear tired afterward.

562
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,519
And his last appointment
probably left him

563
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:34,156
way too winter-bear
tired to stalk
and attack Deanna.

564
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:35,221
Exactly.

565
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,165
And just what did
the police do
when you fed them

566
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:38,725
this peculiar piece
of info-gristle?

567
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:39,827
They spit it out.

568
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,805
In fact,
they're so certain
that he's the guy,

569
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,933
they've taken
the 2<i>4</i>- hour guard off
of Deanna's hospital room.

570
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:55,414
Jules, that's no good.
You gotta get security
back on that door.

571
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:56,818
The killer
will come back.
He'll try again.

572
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,413
At the very least,
her dad is always
by her bedside.

573
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:00,753
Have you seen that dude?

574
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:03,385
She needs more security
than a 60-year-old
in a track suit.

575
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:06,294
Look, without protection,
you might as well just send
the killer an invitation,

576
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,798
saying,
"Hey, come on back,
finish the job."

577
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,630
I wonder if they make
invitations for that.

578
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:13,000
I don't see why not.
You can send an evite
for anything.

579
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,265
This is true.

580
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:17,103
Lassiter thinks
it's an inefficient
use of manpower.

581
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:19,405
I'll see what I can divine.
What's this?

582
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:21,945
It's rest of the paperwork
on Felix's first break-in.

583
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:24,948
I figure you need
all this information
to do your psychic stuff.

584
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,286
I can feel these two crimes
were not committed
by the same person.

585
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:41,264
But in order for
your brothers in blue
to be wrong,

586
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,267
we're saying
Felix was framed.

587
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,895
We're saying it was somebody
who knew he would be targeted
by the police.

588
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:48,531
You're saying it.
I'm stealthily
lending an ear,

589
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,303
I'm saying
it was an excellent,
slam-dunk frame-up.

590
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,344
This somebody was
a pretty bad guy.
Yes.

591
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:54,673
Ugly on the inside.

592
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:58,512
Thought of every detail.
A virtual hunchback
mastermind...

593
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:00,915
Shawn! Just let me know
what you find.

594
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:03,318
And remember,
psychic intuition's
not gonna help this guy.

595
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:04,582
Evidence will.

596
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,453
Oh, one more thing.

597
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:07,821
Roosters don't cackle.

598
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:09,553

I beg your pardon.

599
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,528
They cock-a-doodle-doo.

(LASSITER AND HENRY
CHATTERING)

601
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:26,810
You've got
to be kidding me.

602
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:28,539
Shawn, what are
you doing here?

603
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:29,773
I don't know.

604
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:32,578
I guess I took a wrong turn
and ended it up in
<i>The Twilight Zone.</i>

605
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,675
What the hell's
going on here?

606
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:35,743
What? We caught us
some lunch this morning.

607
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,549
Hooked them,
cooked them
and ate them.

608
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:38,987
How tribal of you.

609
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,354
Shawn never really was
one for roughing it.

610
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:45,157
We went camping once,
found him curled up
inside his sleeping bag

611
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,130
because a raccoon
was hunting him.

612
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:49,860
Stalking me.
The raccoon was
stalking me, Dad.

613
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:54,303
And I came to
talk to you. Alone.

614
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:56,533
All righty.
So, what's wrong?

615
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,710
All right,
here's the thing.

616
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:00,870
(EXCLAIMS)

617
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:05,377
Why is there
a picture of Lassiter
on your refrigerator?

618
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,374
That's a picture
of the fish.

619
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:09,920
I didn't even know
he was in there.

620
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,779
What could
you guys possibly talk
about out there?

621
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,155
Shawn, that is
the beauty part.
Nothing.

622
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:17,694
He knows to sit there,
shut up and fish.

623
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:20,458
What? You think
we sit out there, we yap
about you all day long?

624
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,591
I can't really wrap
my brain around any of it.

625
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:25,135
All right,
so what's so important?

626
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:27,898
I'm working on a case.

627
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:32,501
And I know that they've
arrested the wrong guy.

628
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:33,771

The M.O.

630
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:38,538
Right? This guy in custody,
he trashes a girl's house,
trashes it,

631
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:42,143
but then, at the apartment
when they find her,
it's practically sterile.

632
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,983
I'm talking about
a perfect crime scene.

633
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,819
But I cannot find anything
in these police reports
to back me up.

634
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,553
Right there.
You see, right there.
That's your first problem.

635
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:51,618
What?
The police reports.

636
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:54,597
Shawn, a police report
is always from somebody
else's point of view.

637
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,190
I've written
a ton of them myself,

638
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:58,827
and one thing you cannot do
is take them as gospel.

639
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:02,472
All right?
So let's run
this again.

640
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,303
Now you've been to
both crime scenes, right?

641
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,400
Right. Well, the first one
was after the fact,

642
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,968
but I've been
to both places, yeah.

643
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,479
Okay. So...

644
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:11,540
close your eyes.

645
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,208
Dad, I didn't come here
to take a stupid test.
Can't we just talk as men?

646
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:18,915
Shawn, would you trust
your old man for once,
just once?

647
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,090
Close your eyes.

648
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:26,160
Here we go.

649
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,859
All right,
now I want you to go back
to the first crime scene.

650
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,094
This poor girl's house.
What do you see?

651
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:32,963
What do I see?

652
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,167
Her bed.

00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,567

00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:47,148
Come on, keep going.

657
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:48,617
Keep going, Shawn,
what else?

658
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:50,051
No, there is nothing else.

659
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,383
The guy was there
way before me.

660
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,480
Everything looks
different now.

661
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:55,549
Okay. Okay. Now let's go
to the second crime scene.

662
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,095
To this apartment
where she was found.

663
00:29:58,163 --> 00:29:59,926
Can we stop on the way
and get donuts?

664
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:01,488
Shawn, focus.

665
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,958
Keep your eyes closed.

666
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:07,796
What do you see?

667
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:22,312
Wait a minute.

668
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:37,731

to break into.

you pulled me
out of my retreat.

671
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:54,379
I can kiss my chances
of getting Dr. Feelgood
on my route goodbye.

672
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:01,415
Gus, what time
do you have?

673
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:02,516
Where's your watch at?

674
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,619
It's a key tanning month.

675
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,290
2:15 p.m.

676
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,560
2:15 p.m. Right.

677
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,966
It's around the same time
we were here before.

678
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:16,172
So, why are
all these clocks wrong?

679
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:18,068
Dude,

680
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:21,009
I need you to lay the ground,
pretend like you're Deanna.

681
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,877
I am not pretending
to be a woman half
beaten to death, Shawn.

682
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:25,006
You know what?

683
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:27,415
I am starting to wonder
if you have trust issues
with me.

684
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:28,713
Really?
Yes.

685
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:30,219
First, you wouldn't do
the Minefield,

686
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:33,382
now you won't lay on the floor
and pretend to be
an unconscious woman for me.

687
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:34,584
What's going on with you?

688
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:37,457
Two words.
<i>Airwolf</i> windbreaker.

689
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,120
Okay, two more.

690
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,928
<i>Airwolf</i> windbreaker.

691
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,599
Battleship.
Dude, that was like
a million years ago.

692
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:46,659
I'm just saying.

693
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,502
I never cheated again.
Now can we please
just do this?

694
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,508
What is the point in me
pretending to be Deanna?

695
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,907
Something here's weird,
okay?

696
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:56,208
When I was with my dad,
I realized the shadows
coming off those two lamps

697
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:58,340
were in the wrong spots.

698
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,816
I think someone tampered
with this crime scene.

699
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:02,045
Who could do that?

700
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,213
Someone smart.
Someone experienced.

701
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,257
Which is why we need
to recreate the scene

702
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:08,383
so that it is
exactly the way it was
when the cops got here.

703
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:09,517
All right. Fine.

704
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,255
Fine. Now,
in the landlord's statement,

705
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:12,762
he said the body was found

706
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:17,199
here in the supine position.
So, please, if you will...

707
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:20,898
Sure. Just tell me
what supine means.

708
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,863
Gus, supine.

709
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:25,899
Su...
Mmm-hmm.

710
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:29,040
...pine.

711
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,381
You don't know what
the word means, do you?

712
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:34,179
Okay, fine. You win.
Mr. Vocabulary wins.

713
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:37,516
Mr. Vocab is the big winner
tonight, everybody.

714
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:39,419
Thank you.
No, please, please.

715
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,588
It means on your back.

716
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:44,521
(SIGHS)

717
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,223
I knew that.

718
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,889
No, you didn't.

719
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:50,927
Okay.

720
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:57,931
This is off.

721
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:02,641
The lamp is in the same spot,
but the shadows aren't.

722
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:06,011
And something else
is wrong.

723
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:10,577
There are six pictures
on this bookshelf,

724
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,987
there are six pictures
in this photo.

725
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:14,183
What do you expect?

726
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:15,350
Seven.

727
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:17,257
I clearly remember
seven photos, Gus.

728
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,729
<i>There were two pictures</i>
<i>on each shelf</i>
<i>and one shelf with one.</i>

729
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:22,589
<i>That's seven.</i>

730
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,593
It was right here.
Where this box is.

731
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:29,131
Can you remember
what's in the missing photo?

732
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:35,476
I'm not...

733
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:37,039
sure.

734
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,249
What the hell is going on?
Nothing, man.

735
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:46,517
Nothing?

736
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,652
Is that guy dead?

737
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:51,024
(SIGHING) Damn it.
Now you've seen too much.

738
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:52,562
(STAMMERS)
I didn't see anything.

739
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,724
Yeah, you did.
You're in this just as deep
as I am now.

740
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,267
We're gonna have
to work together.

741
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:58,359
Okay?

742
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,734
I assume this building
has an incinerator? Yeah?

743
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,238
Yeah.
Okay.

744
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:04,331
So we just have to
chop up the body

745
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:06,468
and then we put the limbs
in little plastic baggies.

746
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,205
The torso, we're gonna
have to melt down
with a blow torch.

747
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:09,337
Okay, I've heard enough.

748

(EXCLAIMS)

749
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:13,176
(WHISPERS)
Chop up his body?

750
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:15,116
And then you wonder
why I don't trust you?

751
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:17,147
Are we done yet?

752
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,745
One last thing.

753
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,257
Hurry up, Shawn.

754
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:43,242
Shawn, I left my retreat
to solve a crime,
not to order takeout.

755
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:44,747
That's exactly
what we're doing.

756
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:47,341
Hi, there.
What time do you
turn those lights on?

757
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,613
At 5:00,
for the beginning
of the dinner crowd.

758
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:52,178
Never any earlier
for any reason
whatsoever?

759
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:53,947
It's on a timer.

760
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,185
What the hell is the point?

761
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,692
I think I know
who the killer is.

762
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,525
Just one more question.
And this is
absolutely critical.

763
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:07,265
Do your samosas come
with that red onion chutney?

764
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,203
I arraigned
Felix today.

765
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,674
If he's smart
he'll just plead out.

766
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:14,643
Next is the...

767
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:16,874
Jimminy Crickets. What?

768
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,813
He's sensing an anomaly
in the space-time continuum.

769
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:20,009
Oh, it's very serious.

770
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:21,881
They can unravel
the fabric of reality itself.

771
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:25,184
We've been trailing it
from across town.
The distortion is near.

Bless you.

773
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,554
Thank you.

774
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,822
It's in the photos
in the file!

775
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:39,034
Yes. The photos are lying.
That is the anomaly.

776
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,099
It was the distortion that
prevented me from divining
dirty Deanna's attacker.

777
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:44,402
But now,

778
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:46,575
now I have a clear image.

779
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,009
We already know
who attacked her.

780
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,478
He's right, Mr. Spencer.

781
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:50,912
He's wrong.

782
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:54,746
The bludgeoner is close.

783
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:56,516
Follow me.

784
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:08,428

00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:21,470
The photos.

790
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,537
(STAMMERS)
Look at the photos.
Jules, Jules, Jules,

791
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:26,105
what's going on with
the lights in the background,
in the window?

792
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,051
Oh, he's right.
The lights in the restaurant
are on in these photos.

793
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,712
They were off
when we found Deanna.

794
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:32,016
What?
This is crazy.

795
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:34,023
Why would
I attack some woman
I've never met before?

796
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:36,992
Never met? Didn't you
photograph her house when
that Felix guy broke in?

797
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:39,427
SHAWN: Yes, that's when
you met her then. Dude!

798
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:41,488
She liked meeting new people.
And she liked to party.

00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:42,931
And she liked to have
her photo taken.

And guess
who takes photos
for a living. You!

801
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:47,260
And it was nice,
and it was on,

802
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,033
and you were giving it
to her, and she liked it.

803
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:53,543
Until she met somebody
who could afford to buy her
nicer jewelry than you.

804
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:55,373
She was on her way
to see him in Tokyo.

805
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:57,471
You decided to confront her
at her apartment.

and you made it nice,
and you left

810

Then you came back here,
and assumed your capacity

that the police have seen
a million times.

818

They'd have known it was you.
So what did you do?

819
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:42,192
You waited for
the forensics guys to split,

that you forgot

00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:08,540
He confessed
to the whole thing.

842
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:11,342
And the police found
a fake hospital badge
at his apartment.

843
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:13,440
They think he was
gonna try to kill her
last night.

844
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:14,944
How's the girl?

845
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,112
The doctors say
she's gonna pull through.

846
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,451
There he is!

847
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,582
Well, you're here,
but you're not gonna go out
like that, are you?

848
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:25,288
Yeah, I can't make it tonight.
I gotta work a double.

849
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:27,860
Hey, I know.
Why don't you take
Junior here?

850
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,092
I'll catch you next week.

851
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:32,602
(PROTESTING)
What are you
talking about?

852
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:36,105
Didn't you just work
back-to-back shifts
on that tennis thing?

853
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:37,765
Okay, fine. You got me.

854
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:41,209
All right. He's actually
capable of taking
all the fun out of fishing.

855
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:43,508
He criticized
my pole technique
for like three hours.

856
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:45,776
It's holding a pole
in the water.
What is there to criticize?

857
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,910
Hey, ease up. That's my pop
you're talking about.

858
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:51,580
I'm beginning to understand
you a little better, Spencer.

859
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,259
Burton, you're back.

860
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:59,125
Sorry I missed
today's program, sir.

861
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:00,754
Well, it's okay.

862
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:03,262
I tried out
a new trust exercise

863
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:05,165
where I pull
a rubber band back
as far as I can

864
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,295
and hold it up to
my trust partner's eye,
and I say,

865
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:09,168
"Do you trust me?
Do you trust me?"

866
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,071
Wow. How did that go?

867
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:14,401
I wish my grip was better.

868
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,971
But the cornea
is resilient.

869
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:18,981
That's true, Tom,
I've heard that.

870
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:22,576
Now, Burton here hates
to drag his personal life
into work matters,

871
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:24,416
but I feel like
you should know,

872
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:28,822
his dear grandmother
somehow managed to dislocate
both of her shoulders, too.

873
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:32,329
I think it was the chin-ups
she was trying to do
on the traction bar.

874
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:33,690
Burton,

875
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:36,733
you have missed
almost every exercise we had
arranged for this weekend.

876
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:39,429
You left a work function
to tend to your
ailing grandmother,

877
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:41,630
even if it was detrimental
to your career.

878
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:42,763
You know
what that tells me?

879
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,001
Tells me you really care
about people.

880
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,502
I do.
He does.

881
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:48,602
And after getting in touch
with my feelings this weekend,

882
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:51,170
I think that's exactly
what the Central Coast
Pharmaceutical Company

883
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:52,306
is all about.

884
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:53,611
Yes.
Okay.

885
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:58,815
Burton's grandmother
is gonna need
a little extra caring after.

886
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:01,050
He would never complain
because I know
he loves his job,

887
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,389
but if there was any way
that his route could be
a little less time...

888
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,053
Save your breath.

889
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:08,394
Burton,
I know that everybody here
wants to get Dr. Magnotti,

890
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:12,232
why don't you swap him out
for a couple of your
less-productive clients?

891
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:15,101
Oh, wow. Wow.
Thank you, Tom.

892
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:17,072
And my grandmother
thanks you,
as a matter of fact.

893
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,473
Well, I'll tell you what.
Once she's feeling better,

894
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:23,070
I want you two to come on
over to my house and have
dinner with my wife and I.

895
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,741
(LAUGHING)
Oh, no, we couldn't.
We couldn't.

896
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,875
Lizzie makes a fondue
that'll knock your socks off.

897
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:29,715
Block of cheese
about the size
of a house cat.

898
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:31,414
We're gonna melt it down
and gobble it up.

899
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,514
Okay.
All right.

900
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,821
Sure. We'd be honored.
And don't be
such a stranger.

901
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:38,191
Hello, Tom. Hello!

902
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:41,262
I am so screwed.
Why?

903
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,799
He wants to meet
my grandmother.
So?

904
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:45,427
So? You know that one of
them is dead and the other
one lives in Jamaica.

905
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:48,131
Dude, relax. I know like
five people that could easily
play your grandmother.

906
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:50,105
Okay, so you know
a line-dancing octogenarian

907
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,005
who can do chin-ups
and has two broken hips?

908
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:53,805
Yeah, as long as
she can be Chinese.

909
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:55,903
Just trust me.
Never mind.

910
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,743
Oh, you do trust me,
right?

911
00:41:57,815 --> 00:42:00,010
I mean, I know
it's a silly thing to say
after all these years,

912
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:03,383
but we don't have
to do these kinds
of exercises, do we?

913
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,485
Battleship rematch?
No, that's all right.

914
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:18,630
<i>In between the lines</i>
<i>there's a lot of obscurity</i>

915
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:22,069
<i>I'm not inclined</i>
<i>to resign to maturity</i>

916
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,638
<i>If it's all right</i>
<i>then you're all wrong</i>

917
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,735
<i>But why bounce around</i>
<i>to the same damn song?</i>

918
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:33,943
<i>You'd rather run</i>
<i>when you can't crawl</i>

919
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:40,014
<i>I know, you know</i>
<i>That I'm not telling the truth</i>

920
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:43,321
<i>I know, you know</i>
<i>They just don't have any proof</i>

921
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,329
<i>Embrace the deception</i>
<i>Learn how to bend</i>

922
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:50,561
<i>Your worst inhibitions</i>
<i>tend to psych you out</i>
<i>in the end</i>

923
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:52,363
<i>I know, you know</i>

924
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:55,899
<i>I know, you know</i>
