1
00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:02,405
<i>So that's it from Thunderbird stadium</i>

2
00:00:02,455 --> 00:00:04,405
<i>As quarterback Sammy
Winslow and the T-birds</i>

3
00:00:04,455 --> 00:00:06,228
<i>Lose another heartbreaker.</i>

4
00:00:06,486 --> 00:00:08,417
<i>Winslow was brilliant at times today,</i>

5
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:09,864
<i>Throwing for three touchdowns,</i>

6
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,256
<i>But his two second-half interceptions
were absolute backbreakers.</i>

7
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:15,914
This is the greatest
moment of my whole life.

8
00:00:15,964 --> 00:00:18,362
Hey, you see, being a cop
has its advantages, huh?

9
00:00:18,412 --> 00:00:20,400
- This is pretty cool.
- Oh, there he comes.

10
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:21,699
Oh, my god.

11
00:00:21,749 --> 00:00:23,400
I gotta get his autograph.

12
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,135
He's so cool.

13
00:00:25,185 --> 00:00:27,148
Just relax, relax.
Remember, he's a person.

14
00:00:27,198 --> 00:00:28,107
Just like me.

15
00:00:28,157 --> 00:00:30,775
Oh, no, he's way better than you.

16
00:00:30,914 --> 00:00:32,524
Hey.

17
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:33,511
Good game.

18
00:00:35,032 --> 00:00:36,227
Uh, great game, Sammy,

19
00:00:36,277 --> 00:00:39,828
But do you want to know why you threw
that interception in the third quarter?

20
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:46,454
Why?

21
00:00:46,455 --> 00:00:49,763
Well, every time you're gonna
throw a quick pass to the left side,

22
00:00:49,813 --> 00:00:52,198
You rub your hands together,
then pat the ball twice.

23
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:55,343
Which is probably why you threw those
six picks in the last three games.

24
00:00:55,393 --> 00:00:58,021
Or something. I
- I don't know.

25
00:00:59,522 --> 00:01:01,354
Uh, sorry. He's a

26
00:01:01,404 --> 00:01:04,246
Perceptive little pain
in the butt or something.

27
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,508
Sorry.

28
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,979
You can't do that. He's a quarterback.

29
00:01:08,029 --> 00:01:09,108
You can't
tell him--

30
00:01:09,158 --> 00:01:10,190
Kid.

31
00:01:15,436 --> 00:01:16,879
Oh, my god.

32
00:01:17,441 --> 00:01:18,694
My god.

33
00:01:18,744 --> 00:01:20,663
Whoa. We got the game ball.

34
00:01:21,212 --> 00:01:22,852
I got the game ball.

35
00:01:28,431 --> 00:01:30,807
Where have you two been?
We've left you 12 messages.

36
00:01:30,808 --> 00:01:33,785
Sorry, we were having our biannual
Rae Dawn Chong movie marathon.

37
00:01:33,835 --> 00:01:34,900
Did you see quest for fire?

38
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:35,963
Guys!

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,757
The chief is not happy.

40
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:40,234
You have to keep your cell
phones on at all times.

41
00:01:40,235 --> 00:01:41,469
This would all be a lot easier

42
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,105
If you would just run with
my genius psych signal idea.

43
00:01:44,106 --> 00:01:45,350
- No.
- Don't you mean yes?

44
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,200
What are you talking about?

45
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:48,544
It's like the bat
signal, only way awesomer.

46
00:01:48,594 --> 00:01:51,480
The silhouette in the sky would be
my hand to my head, psychic-style.

47
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,357
I drew up a whole proposal.

48
00:01:52,407 --> 00:01:54,610
That would have cost
the department $200,000.

49
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,203
We covered that with
our bake sale alone.

50
00:01:56,253 --> 00:01:57,820
And what's going on with our badges?

51
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,953
You're not getting badges.

52
00:01:59,003 --> 00:02:00,639
- She has one.
- She's a cop.

53
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:02,893
All right, fine, we'll settle for guns.

54
00:02:03,128 --> 00:02:04,660
It's about time.

55
00:02:05,148 --> 00:02:07,897
Come with me. We may have
a missing persons case

56
00:02:07,947 --> 00:02:08,923
We need you to look into.

57
00:02:08,973 --> 00:02:10,912
"May have?" That doesn't
sound very definitive.

58
00:02:10,962 --> 00:02:12,700
Do you have any leads?

59
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,177
There's one.

60
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,437
Mr. Spencer, we need you
to psychically tell us

61
00:02:21,487 --> 00:02:23,098
Who belonged to this foot.

62
00:02:27,322 --> 00:02:30,361
Does he know that's where they
keep the bodies for identification?

63
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:32,714
I think he's figuring
that out right now.

64
00:02:35,691 --> 00:02:37,902
There you go.

65
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,315
So what can you tell us?

66
00:02:44,094 --> 00:02:44,895
It's weird.

67
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:48,706
The lower extremities give off
very, very intense psychic vibes.

68
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,759
For instance, the pinky toe is
telling me that he went to the market.

69
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:55,580
I'm sorry. That's wrong. He, uh,

70
00:02:55,638 --> 00:02:57,415
He actually stayed home.

71
00:02:57,673 --> 00:03:00,535
And something about

72
00:03:00,716 --> 00:03:02,428
Wee-wee and roast beef.

73
00:03:02,478 --> 00:03:05,324
Okay, I knew this was a waste of time.

74
00:03:11,298 --> 00:03:13,637
The foot was found
by hikers this morning

75
00:03:13,687 --> 00:03:15,336
On a trail near lake Cachuma.

76
00:03:15,386 --> 00:03:17,859
Mr. Spencer, we have to assume
that we were meant to find

77
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:20,636
This foot, which means that
we're dealing with a psycho.

78
00:03:20,842 --> 00:03:23,622
I'm gonna position this case as
a possible murder investigation.

79
00:03:23,672 --> 00:03:25,982
But I can only keep this foot
thing quiet for a day or two.

80
00:03:26,032 --> 00:03:27,427
I don't want to panic the community.

81
00:03:27,477 --> 00:03:30,426
You're saying you think this
thing might cause quite a stink.

82
00:03:33,828 --> 00:03:36,008
All right, now, I just feel like a heel.

83
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,098
That was callous.

Oh, hey, yeah.

88
00:04:14,478 --> 00:04:15,571
Had to bolt out of there.

89
00:04:15,572 --> 00:04:18,297
My cell phone was, like,
literally shocking my leg.

90
00:04:18,429 --> 00:04:19,834
It must be the battery or something.

91
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,216
I like that story.

92
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:22,484
Let's stick with it.

93
00:04:22,534 --> 00:04:25,003
You know, there was something weird
about the way the big toe was smushed

94
00:04:25,053 --> 00:04:26,548
And the side of the foot was callused.

95
00:04:26,598 --> 00:04:28,292
Not random, almost
symmetrical, you know,

96
00:04:28,342 --> 00:04:29,742
Like it had happened over time.

97
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:32,099
It probably comes from some
repeated action, like kicking.

98
00:04:32,149 --> 00:04:33,099
Or kicking.

99
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:34,010
He could have been an athlete.

100
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:34,873
Like a soccer player.

101
00:04:34,923 --> 00:04:36,135
Or a soccer player.

102
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:38,286
Sorry.

103
00:04:38,336 --> 00:04:39,914
It helps me think.

104
00:04:41,056 --> 00:04:42,622
Google "missing foot. "

105
00:04:42,672 --> 00:04:44,133
That was your plan?

106
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:45,288
Not all of it.

107
00:04:45,338 --> 00:04:46,673
Watch out, watch out!

108
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:48,045
Rogue foot on the loose.

109
00:04:48,095 --> 00:04:49,413
I can't control it.

110
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:52,415
It's heel-toed, down
from the spirit world

111
00:04:52,465 --> 00:04:54,544
To give me a swift kick
in the ass, and now--

112
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,668
But now it's channeling a
message through my own foot.

113
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:57,929
What's it saying?

114
00:04:57,979 --> 00:04:59,600
Besides, "everyone cut loose"?

115
00:05:00,207 --> 00:05:01,206
Let's listen.

116
00:05:02,646 --> 00:05:05,412
Something about the big
toe, the way it was smushed,

117
00:05:05,462 --> 00:05:07,734
Callused, as if it
belonged to someone who

118
00:05:07,784 --> 00:05:09,035
Kicked things a lot.

119
00:05:09,085 --> 00:05:10,474
- A prison guard?
- A rockette?

120
00:05:10,524 --> 00:05:11,796
- A kangaroo.
- An athlete.

121
00:05:11,846 --> 00:05:13,955
Yes, an athlete.
Perhaps a soccer player?

122
00:05:14,152 --> 00:05:15,231
Soccer players wear shoes.

123
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,556
The toe thing wouldn't happen
unless the person was barefoot.

124
00:05:17,606 --> 00:05:19,136
Again, let me pitch kangaroo.

125
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:20,779
What else do you have, Spencer?

126
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:21,702
I mean, do you have a name?

127
00:05:21,752 --> 00:05:23,857
Are they in danger?
Are they still alive?

128
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:27,462
Darn it. Vision gone.

129
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,211
I'll have to sit with this one.

130
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:32,422
Just get back to us when you have
something, and it better be quick.

131
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,246
Chief, my middle name is quick.

132
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:36,312
I changed it from Boutros-Ghali.

133
00:05:39,702 --> 00:05:41,221
Are you sure it's Vlad Alexavic?

134
00:05:41,271 --> 00:05:43,736
Think about it-- He's the only player in
the league that kicks without his shoe.

135
00:05:43,786 --> 00:05:45,913
Plus, you said he had surgery
on his ankle last year.

136
00:05:45,963 --> 00:05:48,397
Yeah, he jumped off of Kathy
griffin's balcony on a dare.

137
00:05:48,447 --> 00:05:50,753
Blew out his ankle.
Missed the entire playoffs.

138
00:05:50,803 --> 00:05:52,883
That scar on the ankle was fresh.

139
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:53,871
I don't know, Shawn.

140
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,456
Even for you, that's a big leap.

141
00:05:55,506 --> 00:05:56,383
And what are we gonna do?

142
00:05:56,433 --> 00:05:58,205
Just walk into a pro
football training camp

143
00:05:58,255 --> 00:06:00,049
And just start asking if
anyone's missing a foot?

144
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:03,200
The words "foolproof" and
"plan" do come to mind, yes.

145
00:06:03,745 --> 00:06:04,954
What are you guys doing here?

146
00:06:05,004 --> 00:06:06,640
I was drawn here by a name

147
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,435
That's been kicking around
my psychic third brain.

148
00:06:09,485 --> 00:06:10,651
- Vlad—
- Vlad Alexavic,

149
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:11,809
The t-bird kicker?

150
00:06:12,035 --> 00:06:14,098
Yeah, after you left, I started
thinking about the connection

151
00:06:14,148 --> 00:06:15,972
Between the big toe and an athlete,

152
00:06:16,022 --> 00:06:18,298
And then I realized
Vlad is the only kicker

153
00:06:18,348 --> 00:06:19,544
Who kicks without a shoe.

154
00:06:19,594 --> 00:06:20,865
Jules,

155
00:06:20,915 --> 00:06:22,506
Color me impressed.

156
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:24,107
And purple, with a streak of magenta.

157
00:06:24,157 --> 00:06:27,460
Well, I-I dated a Miami
dolphin for a while one summer.

158
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,979
Oh, yeah, so you're

159
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:31,760
Really attracted to big,
meat-headed football players.

160
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,516
Oh, they're not all meatheads.

161
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,790
And I don't know, it's just

162
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,110
Something about that uniform.

163
00:06:39,705 --> 00:06:40,536
Yeah.

164
00:06:40,586 --> 00:06:42,210
So. Anyway.

165
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,867
Shawn and I thought that if we could
get some information about Vlad--

166
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:45,961
- It's already done.
- And the team

167
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:48,365
We matched DNA samples
to the foot yesterday.

168
00:06:48,677 --> 00:06:49,816
It's Vlad.

169
00:06:57,004 --> 00:06:58,453
Set, hut!

170
00:06:58,713 --> 00:07:00,413
Out round.

171
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:06,587
Dude, can you believe this?

172
00:07:06,637 --> 00:07:09,998
We're standing on the field of an
actual pro football training camp.

173
00:07:10,048 --> 00:07:11,228
This is awesome.

174
00:07:11,351 --> 00:07:12,638
My dad would love this.

175
00:07:12,647 --> 00:07:13,447
Yeah.

176
00:07:13,448 --> 00:07:14,729
Too bad he's not talking to you.

177
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:16,433
You should have just
gone on the camping trip.

178
00:07:16,773 --> 00:07:18,068
I'll make it up to him next week.

179
00:07:18,431 --> 00:07:19,436
I'll head over there for dinner,

180
00:07:19,486 --> 00:07:20,935
Bring him a pouch of big league chew,

181
00:07:20,985 --> 00:07:23,116
Maybe watch a couple of
episodes of the mentalist.

182
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,021
It'll be fine.

183
00:07:56,354 --> 00:07:57,177
Dude!

184
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,857
This is going to be the
coolest case of all time.

185
00:07:59,907 --> 00:08:01,631
I should have brought my autograph book.

186
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,771
I've been stuck on C. Everett
Koop and Drew Lachey for a while.

187
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:06,374
I don't see what the big deal is.

188
00:08:06,424 --> 00:08:08,148
A bunch of guys in tights and hard hats,

189
00:08:08,198 --> 00:08:09,760
Playing in the dirt.

190
00:08:09,942 --> 00:08:10,744
What?

191
00:08:10,794 --> 00:08:11,943
I'm not a big fan of football.

192
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:13,775
What are you a fan of, exactly?

193
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:14,758
I don't know.

194
00:08:14,808 --> 00:08:16,714
The gun sports.

195
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,043
What are we waiting for?

196
00:08:18,093 --> 00:08:19,295
To talk to Sam Winslow.

197
00:08:19,345 --> 00:08:20,736
He's the coach and general manager.

198
00:08:20,786 --> 00:08:23,069
Are you kidding me? We get to
meet slingin' Sammy Winslow?

199
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:24,011
- What!
- So?

200
00:08:24,061 --> 00:08:26,789
So he's one of the greatest quarterbacks
in the history of pro football.

201
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,308
He also happens to be a
very good friend of mine.

202
00:08:28,358 --> 00:08:29,638
You met him once when you were ten.

203
00:08:29,688 --> 00:08:31,781
And the only thing that
my dad and I both like

204
00:08:31,831 --> 00:08:33,510
Besides Asian slaw and harry Hamlin.

205
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,493
Who's with me?

206
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:36,396
Who's with me on Hamlin?

207
00:08:36,578 --> 00:08:37,535
Literally,

208
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:38,711
No one is with you.

209
00:08:38,761 --> 00:08:41,941
Sammy won a championship
his first season as a coach,

210
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:44,344
But he hasn't even been to
the playoffs in six years.

211
00:08:44,394 --> 00:08:46,269
It sounds like he's
not a very good coach.

212
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,092
<i>Come on. You call that
a two-minute drill?</i>

213
00:08:50,142 --> 00:08:53,615
<i>I could get to Dallas on my nephew's
big wheel faster than you ladies.</i>

214
00:08:53,665 --> 00:08:54,947
It's ridiculous.

215
00:08:54,997 --> 00:08:56,277
Reset.

216
00:08:56,592 --> 00:08:58,403
It's ridiculous.

217
00:08:58,453 --> 00:08:59,852
I see you're too tall to be an agent.

218
00:08:59,902 --> 00:09:00,990
You must be a shoe rep.

219
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,264
No, I'm a cop.

220
00:09:02,314 --> 00:09:03,882
We need to speak to you
about one of your players.

221
00:09:03,932 --> 00:09:06,498
I'm detective Lassiter. This
is my partner, detective O’Hara,

222
00:09:06,548 --> 00:09:08,121
And these are...

223
00:09:10,136 --> 00:09:11,169
never mind.

224
00:09:11,805 --> 00:09:14,159
I don't want the press to see this.

225
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:15,988
I'll give you two minutes,
all right. Come with me.

226
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:17,310
Thank you.

227
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,154
You found Vlad's foot?

228
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:28,625
You sure it's his?

229
00:09:28,675 --> 00:09:29,871
I'm afraid so.

230
00:09:29,921 --> 00:09:31,080
When's the last time you saw him?

231
00:09:31,308 --> 00:09:33,163
It's been a few weeks.

232
00:09:33,213 --> 00:09:34,799
I mean, he was a holdout.

233
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:37,234
I mean, Vlad's always been
a bit of a free spirit.

234
00:09:37,514 --> 00:09:39,739
I mean, he's disappeared
during the off-season before.

235
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:40,959
I just thought he was doing it again.

236
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:42,573
We're gonna need to speak
with some of your players.

237
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,282
We'd appreciate it if
you kept the information

238
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,458
about Mr. Alexavic
quiet for the time being.

239
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:48,539
Could someone have killed him?

240
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,512
That's what we're here to find out.

241
00:09:56,978 --> 00:09:59,638
I can't believe I'm saying this,

242
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:02,193
But you two think you could
have spoken up a little bit?

243
00:10:03,344 --> 00:10:04,240
Sorry about that.

244
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,499
It's what happens to us when we're
in the presence of one of our heroes.

245
00:10:07,711 --> 00:10:11,088
Gus almost fainted when we ran
into Ralph Macchio at a del taco.

246
00:10:11,138 --> 00:10:12,811
For the record, he
was not working there.

247
00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:14,401
Why don't we interview the players

248
00:10:14,402 --> 00:10:16,484
and you guys take care
of everything else?

249
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:17,395
Sure.

250
00:10:17,445 --> 00:10:19,521
Heard you guys were asking
questions about Vlad.

251
00:10:19,571 --> 00:10:21,114
What's going on?

252
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,699
It's unclear at this
point, Mr. Tompkins.

253
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:25,387
It's Matt.

254
00:10:25,437 --> 00:10:28,184
Look, Vlad's one of my
bros. If there's a problem,

255
00:10:28,234 --> 00:10:29,034
I wanna know about it.

256
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:32,579
If you have any information about
Vlad, we could really use the help.

257
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:35,160
Well, I don't want to start
any rumors or anything, but

258
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,369
I did hear that he owed
a lot of money to people.

259
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:39,722
- What people?
- Bookies, I think.

260
00:10:39,935 --> 00:10:42,358
I also heard a rumor that he
tried to start a night club with

261
00:10:42,359 --> 00:10:44,442
some of his cousins
and lost a sh--

262
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:47,131
Load of money.

263
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:49,015
That'd be Russian cousins?

264
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,160
What do you think?

265
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:03,928
Great, While you guys were goofing
off, we actually got a lead.

266
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,741
Matt Tompkins told us that
Vlad lost a bunch of money

267
00:11:06,742 --> 00:11:08,289
that belonged to some Russian cousins.

268
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:09,279
What'd you guys find?

269
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:10,611
Just this.

270
00:11:10,661 --> 00:11:11,466
What's that?

271
00:11:11,516 --> 00:11:12,590
Vlad's phone.

272
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,018
We found it in his locker.

273
00:11:14,068 --> 00:11:15,113
You stole it?

274
00:11:15,163 --> 00:11:17,282
Benji, the locker room
attendant, let us in.

275
00:11:17,332 --> 00:11:19,345
Big fan of Rent.
Told him Gus was Taye Diggs,

276
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,100
so he also gave us these old jerseys.

277
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,191
How do I look, Jules?

278
00:11:22,241 --> 00:11:24,909
Like my 11-year-old nephew
in his Peyton Manning pajamas.

279
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,582
Your 11-year-old
nephew's ruggedly sexy.

280
00:11:26,632 --> 00:11:28,693
- That's weird.
- Whoa. Hang on.

281
00:11:29,012 --> 00:11:30,608
Look at that.

282
00:11:30,658 --> 00:11:32,066
That is a direct threat.

283
00:11:32,116 --> 00:11:34,254
This plus the foot screams Russian mob.

284
00:11:34,304 --> 00:11:35,930
Really? I don't hear anything.

285
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,191
I'm just saying we found
that phone awfully easy,

286
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:40,713
And there just happens to be a
threatening text on it? Come on.

287
00:11:40,763 --> 00:11:42,922
So you think someone
planted it in his locker.

288
00:11:42,972 --> 00:11:44,724
No, I think someone
put it there on purpose.

289
00:11:44,907 --> 00:11:46,032
That's what I just said.

290
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:49,210
Mine wasn't in the form of a question,
so it comes from a place of power.

291
00:11:50,087 --> 00:11:51,588
I'm not gonna stand
here and listen to this,

292
00:11:51,638 --> 00:11:54,290
And we'll be back with a search
warrant for the contents of that locker.

293
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,994
You see, we actually
follow police procedure.

294
00:12:00,031 --> 00:12:01,723
So what do we do now?

295
00:12:01,773 --> 00:12:03,741
Benji said the only ones
allowed in the locker room

296
00:12:03,742 --> 00:12:05,153
are players and team personnel.

297
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,870
The answer to what happened
to Vlad is not in some

298
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,384
Russian bathhouse.

299
00:12:09,434 --> 00:12:11,083
No, we need to get close to the team.

300
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:12,469
Are you saying we go undercover?

301
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:14,593
I'm saying we assume
alternate identies.

302
00:12:14,643 --> 00:12:16,520
So that we can get in
there and investigate

303
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,424
Without drawing any extra
attention to ourselves.

304
00:12:25,698 --> 00:12:27,651
Coach Winslow?
Sorry to bother you.

305
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:29,595
It's all right. Come in.

306
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:33,271
You were with the cops earlier.

307
00:12:34,425 --> 00:12:35,747
You didn't say a word.

308
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:39,159
No, it's because I was observing.

309
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:40,192
My name is Shawn Spencer.

310
00:12:40,242 --> 00:12:42,702
I'm a psychic that works for the SBPD.

311
00:12:44,145 --> 00:12:46,672
This is my partner, du
quoin "smallpox" Randolph.

312
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:48,094
You can call him Gus.

313
00:12:48,144 --> 00:12:50,865
We work on high-profile
cases like this all the time.

314
00:12:50,915 --> 00:12:52,364
Yeah, well,

315
00:12:52,414 --> 00:12:53,746
This is my fault.

316
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:57,116
I mean, I knew that Vlad was going off
the rails, and I didn't do anything.

317
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,485
No, no, no, coach, please.

318
00:12:58,535 --> 00:12:59,858
Don't beat yourself up.

319
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:03,819
You-- You probably
get this a lot, but

320
00:13:04,026 --> 00:13:06,734
But we're huge fans of yours.

321
00:13:07,248 --> 00:13:09,574
I slept on your face for years.

322
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,000
I mean, I had sheets with
you on them when I was a kid.

323
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:14,537
And we've actually met before.

324
00:13:14,587 --> 00:13:17,287
I was the kid after the Denver game
who told you about your interceptions.

325
00:13:17,337 --> 00:13:18,368
Oh, yeah.

326
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,753
I told you he'd rember me.

327
00:13:20,297 --> 00:13:21,493
Yeah.

328
00:13:23,188 --> 00:13:25,298
You know, I didn't throw a
pick the rest of the year.

329
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,647
Oh, boy, I thought I'd play
football forever, you know?

330
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:33,708
Sure as heck never
thought I'd end up a coach.

331
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:36,562
Well,

332
00:13:36,612 --> 00:13:37,801
Coach,

333
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:41,878
I'm here because I'm sensing some
very dark forces coming from your team.

334
00:13:42,136 --> 00:13:44,059
Whoever did this to Vlad

335
00:13:44,109 --> 00:13:46,490
Might want to harm
other players as well.

336
00:13:46,672 --> 00:13:47,994
I think that we can help.

337
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:50,083
How can you possibly help?

338
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,491
Red 17!

339
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:56,721
Red 17 check down!

340
00:13:56,771 --> 00:13:57,652
Check down! Red!

341
00:13:57,702 --> 00:13:58,989
- 17 dragon!
- Shawn!

342
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,194
- Wildebeest!
- Shawn!

343
00:14:00,244 --> 00:14:02,412
<i>Bevell came back too
early from his concussion.</i>

344
00:14:02,462 --> 00:14:03,430
<i>He's afraid of getting hit.</i>

345
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,378
Fletcher.

346
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:07,093
<i>Well, he's worrying about his
divorce. He's not focused on the game.</i>

347
00:14:07,143 --> 00:14:09,328
<i>Dayne may seem heavy, but
it's just water weight.</i>

348
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:10,429
<i>He's actually gonna be fine.</i>

349
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:12,610
<i>Bollinger is freaking out because
he thinks his wife might know</i>

350
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,552
<i>That he's sleeping with the
reporter from channel five.</i>

351
00:14:14,602 --> 00:14:17,493
And Calderwood, well, he's just not
cool with being demoted to second team,

352
00:14:17,543 --> 00:14:19,276
Even if he says he is.

353
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:23,717
Yes, no, mean, juiced, possibly gay,

354
00:14:23,767 --> 00:14:25,357
Definitely gay.

355
00:14:29,028 --> 00:14:30,118
That is incredible.

356
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:33,309
I mean, I already knew about
Dayne, suspected Kenny, but

357
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:35,192
I mean, that still--
That's impressive.

358
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:36,992
So what is in this for you?

359
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,532
Well, we just want to find
whoever did this to Vlad,

360
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:41,072
Help you get your team back.

361
00:14:44,881 --> 00:14:49,256
And maybe lead the team out of
the tunnel one time before a game?

362
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:51,006
That is not gonna happen.

363
00:14:51,626 --> 00:14:53,251
But, you know, I may need your help.

364
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:54,810
But there's just one problem.

365
00:14:55,284 --> 00:14:56,520
I mean, these guys are not gonna

366
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,281
Just let somebody walk in off
the street and get close to them.

367
00:14:59,444 --> 00:15:01,484
They have to think that you belong.

368
00:15:02,713 --> 00:15:04,016
All right. Let's get this done fast.

369
00:15:04,066 --> 00:15:05,439
We've got ten other
spots to check today.

370
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:08,034
They said the locker room guy has
the key, and he's on the field.

371
00:15:09,768 --> 00:15:12,171
All right, I want to see
all the kickers trying out

372
00:15:12,221 --> 00:15:14,039
On the field right now.

373
00:15:26,578 --> 00:15:27,841
That's right. It's real.

374
00:15:28,493 --> 00:15:29,973
Feel free to drink it in.

375
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:45,636
- Some help?
- Ok!

376
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,060
So, Adam,

377
00:15:49,576 --> 00:15:53,030
Vlad just came in here last year
and beat you out for the job, huh?

378
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,204
Yeah, well,

379
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:57,326
He's not here, so
it's my job to win now.

380
00:15:59,482 --> 00:16:01,366
Shanked that a little.

381
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:02,480
I never heard of you before.

382
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,346
You said you played in Tampa?

383
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,185
Tel Aviv.

384
00:16:07,235 --> 00:16:08,468
Israeli arena league.

385
00:16:08,642 --> 00:16:10,974
Didn't play on the Sabbath,
so you probably didn't see me.

386
00:16:11,024 --> 00:16:12,432
I've also been out of the
game for a little while.

387
00:16:12,482 --> 00:16:14,608
I had a couple of knee
surgeries, and this elbow

388
00:16:14,658 --> 00:16:16,776
Filled with ostrich cartilage.

389
00:16:16,777 --> 00:16:17,728
Six.

390
00:16:17,778 --> 00:16:19,273
- Get out there and kick.
- Yeah, coach

391
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,842
Did I see you give an
interview to espn this morning?

392
00:16:23,892 --> 00:16:25,421
First of all,

393
00:16:25,471 --> 00:16:26,976
It was espn-deportes.

394
00:16:27,026 --> 00:16:28,576
And it was an exclusive, coach.

395
00:16:28,626 --> 00:16:30,826
You can't be giving interviews.

396
00:16:30,876 --> 00:16:32,343
You're a non-roster invitee.

397
00:16:32,393 --> 00:16:34,170
I told the docs you had an MCL tear,

398
00:16:34,171 --> 00:16:35,454
which means no kicking.

399
00:16:35,504 --> 00:16:36,750
You're here to solve a murder.

400
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,301
No interviews, no kicking,
solve the murder. Got it.

401
00:16:39,864 --> 00:16:41,609
All right, let's go, girls. Pick it up.

402
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:43,954
- My grandmother moves faster than that.
- All right,

403
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,614
Estevez, Estevez, you're up.

404
00:16:45,664 --> 00:16:48,678
Actually it's Emilio
Estevez, Est-tev-ez.

405
00:16:48,728 --> 00:16:50,898
And I have a knee
injury, so I can't kick.

406
00:16:50,948 --> 00:16:52,625
If you ain't gonna kick,
then get off this field.

407
00:16:52,675 --> 00:16:53,842
You saying I don't have a choice?

408
00:16:53,892 --> 00:16:55,417
No. Get out there.

409
00:17:06,695 --> 00:17:08,232
What's up?

410
00:17:08,426 --> 00:17:09,854
That was awesome!

411
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,135
It was just a 21-yarder.

412
00:17:11,185 --> 00:17:12,318
Yeah, well,

413
00:17:12,368 --> 00:17:14,014
I was in an iron lung a week ago.

414
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,074
Dude, check the books.

415
00:17:16,124 --> 00:17:18,194
I think I just tied tom Dempsey’s
record for longest field goal.

416
00:17:18,244 --> 00:17:19,622
Yeah, no, you didn't.

417
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:22,101
His record is 63 yards, not 63 feet.

418
00:17:22,151 --> 00:17:23,765
What's up in your world?

419
00:17:24,094 --> 00:17:25,885
Look, Shawn, we can't be wasting time.

420
00:17:26,054 --> 00:17:27,948
Lassiter's on his Russian
thing, and we only have two days

421
00:17:27,998 --> 00:17:29,221
To figure out what happened to Vlad.

422
00:17:29,271 --> 00:17:30,498
Two days

423
00:17:30,548 --> 00:17:32,792
To fulfill 20 years of fantasies.

424
00:17:33,007 --> 00:17:34,511
That's what a team manager wears, huh?

425
00:17:34,561 --> 00:17:35,999
I'm not a team manager.

426
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:37,323
I'm a training intern.

427
00:17:37,373 --> 00:17:39,648
And I've been setting up
massage tables for the last hour.

428
00:17:39,698 --> 00:17:41,520
You know what they do on
those massage tables, Shawn?

429
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,568
They play connect four.

430
00:17:42,618 --> 00:17:43,875
They massage men.

431
00:17:43,925 --> 00:17:45,227
Big, hairy men.

432
00:17:45,728 --> 00:17:49,144
Look, let me be very clear. These
hands are not touching anyone.

433
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:51,461
I only use these hands to touch myself.

434
00:17:53,915 --> 00:17:56,151
- Let me rephrase that.
- Please stop speaking.

435
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:58,291
And no more fist bumps
for the rest of the day.

436
00:17:59,105 --> 00:18:02,594
Carlton, we have been to every place
even remotely connected to Russia

437
00:18:02,644 --> 00:18:04,788
And all of eastern Europe,
and we have found nothing.

438
00:18:04,838 --> 00:18:06,991
We have to start looking someplace else.

439
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,252
Maybe there's something in
this stuff from Vlad's locker.

440
00:18:13,774 --> 00:18:15,490
Just a bunch of junk.

441
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:19,217
What?

442
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:21,541
Well, Tompkins said he thought
Vlad was gambling, right?

443
00:18:21,591 --> 00:18:23,804
- Yeah.
- These could be bets that he made.

444
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:27,124
Look, it says Miami
plus six, K.C. Minus two.

445
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:28,734
Look at this.

446
00:18:28,784 --> 00:18:30,487
It's a phone number.

447
00:18:30,537 --> 00:18:31,690
Do you still have Vlad's phone records?

448
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,173
Yeah, but they didn't show anything.

449
00:18:33,223 --> 00:18:35,285
The text Vlad got was
from a disposable phone.

450
00:18:35,335 --> 00:18:38,115
Check this.
805-555-14--

451
00:18:38,165 --> 00:18:39,302
2-1?

452
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:41,122
That number called Vlad twice last week.

453
00:18:41,775 --> 00:18:43,719
We got a lead. Let's go.

454
00:18:44,949 --> 00:18:47,427
While you were fooling
around, I was investigating.

455
00:18:47,477 --> 00:18:50,412
Ever since the cops came,
everyone's talking about Vlad.

456
00:18:52,973 --> 00:18:54,041
What are they saying?

457
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,134
None of the players liked that dude.

458
00:18:56,184 --> 00:18:57,291
He either owes them money,

459
00:18:57,341 --> 00:19:00,298
Tried to sleep with their wives,
or called them out in the press.

460
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:07,263
- Did I move it?
- No.

461
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,268
- Not one nanometer.
- Nanometer. What is that?

462
00:19:09,318 --> 00:19:10,784
Like two or three feet?

463
00:19:15,838 --> 00:19:17,538
I don't think everyone
hated Vlad. Check it out.

464
00:19:17,588 --> 00:19:19,984
He has one of those warriors
towels in his locker too.

465
00:19:20,273 --> 00:19:21,671
They call themselves the warriors

466
00:19:21,672 --> 00:19:23,538
because they're the
craziest guys on the team.

467
00:19:23,588 --> 00:19:27,219
Matt Tompkins, Vince Garner,
and Drew Shacker are the leaders.

468
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:29,068
Man.

469
00:19:32,646 --> 00:19:34,852
Now I'm gonna have to figure out
a way to get close to those guys

470
00:19:34,902 --> 00:19:37,113
That doesn't involve getting a lobotomy

471
00:19:37,163 --> 00:19:41,206
Or showering with strange
men with volcano nipples.

472
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:45,448
Coach is crazy if he thinks I'm
playing special teams this year.

473
00:19:45,498 --> 00:19:47,670
I get injured on a play,
there goes my bonus.

474
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,894
Exactly, right?

475
00:19:55,709 --> 00:19:56,981
Dude, what are you doing?

476
00:19:57,289 --> 00:19:58,888
Have you guys seen altered states?

477
00:19:58,938 --> 00:19:59,936
No.

478
00:19:59,986 --> 00:20:02,473
Just got back from being a monkey.

479
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:05,419
Why did I think that would land?

480
00:20:05,469 --> 00:20:07,240
You scared the hell out of us, bro.

481
00:20:12,103 --> 00:20:13,648
Sorry, bro.

482
00:20:13,698 --> 00:20:16,213
Emilio Estevez
Est-te-vez.

483
00:20:16,332 --> 00:20:17,137
New kicker.

484
00:20:17,187 --> 00:20:18,272
You mean like the actor guy?

485
00:20:18,404 --> 00:20:19,693
You're thinking of Charlie Sheen.

486
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,600
What?

487
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,861
Actually, you're probably
not thinking of anything.

488
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,397
Nice ink.

489
00:20:25,447 --> 00:20:26,718
Thanks, man.

490
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,777
Yeah, this is my wife.

491
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:30,210
That's my mom.

492
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,629
And that's the stripper I hook
up with in Vegas sometimes.

493
00:20:34,478 --> 00:20:35,847
Very sweet.

494
00:20:35,897 --> 00:20:37,335
I dated a dancer once.

495
00:20:37,385 --> 00:20:38,318
Destiny.

496
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,311
Real name was glitter.

497
00:20:41,594 --> 00:20:42,816
Nothing there?

498
00:20:43,393 --> 00:20:45,145
So

499
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,262
What's up with your kicker, Vlad?

500
00:20:47,701 --> 00:20:49,367
Some pretty crazy
rumors floating around.

501
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:50,603
I don't know what to tell you, man.

502
00:20:50,653 --> 00:20:51,981
Vlad's kind of a loner.

503
00:20:52,031 --> 00:20:53,386
Yeah, we didn't really know him.

504
00:20:53,436 --> 00:20:55,292
I heard something about some Russians.

505
00:20:55,342 --> 00:20:57,451
I hope it's not that they're coming.

506
00:20:59,046 --> 00:21:00,018
They're coming.

507
00:21:01,615 --> 00:21:03,149
The Russians.

508
00:21:08,812 --> 00:21:10,048
Well,

509
00:21:10,098 --> 00:21:11,539
That's it for me.

510
00:21:12,754 --> 00:21:13,908
I...

511
00:21:17,548 --> 00:21:19,659
I gotta go get my steroids shot.

512
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:22,242
Whoops. Probably shouldn't
have said that out loud.

513
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:24,592
Steer clear.

514
00:21:24,642 --> 00:21:26,712
Might be some pee in that one.

515
00:21:29,707 --> 00:21:32,043
This is definitely the address.

516
00:21:33,216 --> 00:21:35,314
And there's a picture
of Vlad on the shelf.

517
00:21:35,814 --> 00:21:36,748
Oh, no.

518
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,644
Look at that.

519
00:21:40,117 --> 00:21:41,864
Madam,

520
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:44,289
Why do you have that picture here?

521
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:47,425
Ooh, I'm a huge fan of Chad.

522
00:21:47,475 --> 00:21:49,963
One day I plan to have his baby.

523
00:21:50,491 --> 00:21:51,994
We're detectives with the sped.

524
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:55,076
We're looking for any information
you might have on Vlad Alexavic.

525
00:21:55,126 --> 00:21:56,100
Oh, jeez

526
00:21:59,705 --> 00:22:00,768
Go around back.

527
00:22:17,328 --> 00:22:18,788
Get on your knees!

528
00:22:19,622 --> 00:22:20,828
Hands on your head.

529
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,131
Nice work, O’Hara.

530
00:22:24,716 --> 00:22:27,331
"Sergee van Geef. "

531
00:22:27,381 --> 00:22:28,884
- Vangieff.
- Yeah, whatever.

532
00:22:28,934 --> 00:22:31,653
You, my friend, have a big problem.

533
00:22:31,899 --> 00:22:33,388
Your visa runs out next month.

534
00:22:33,438 --> 00:22:35,298
- So?
- So...

535
00:22:35,348 --> 00:22:37,987
you either give us something,
or it's bye-bye, Santa Barbara;

536
00:22:38,037 --> 00:22:39,313
Hello, St. Petersburg.

537
00:22:39,363 --> 00:22:41,114
I can't go back to Russia, man.

538
00:22:41,164 --> 00:22:43,198
My lady and I, we are
starting aquarium store.

539
00:22:43,248 --> 00:22:44,953
We already have a bathtub full of Koi.

540
00:22:45,003 --> 00:22:47,188
Why were you calling
Vlad Alexavic last week?

541
00:22:47,238 --> 00:22:48,201
Did I?

542
00:22:50,342 --> 00:22:51,479
Okay.

543
00:22:51,965 --> 00:22:53,327
Vlad owes me money.

544
00:22:53,377 --> 00:22:55,362
You were booking bets for him, right?

545
00:22:55,412 --> 00:22:56,879
That's why you ran?

546
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:58,375
Da.

547
00:22:58,425 --> 00:22:59,637
But it was just to make money

548
00:22:59,687 --> 00:23:02,505
To buy fountain of child
spitting water for store.

549
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:05,890
His old girlfriend introduced
us. Vlad and I are friends.

550
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,122
Sergei,

551
00:23:07,172 --> 00:23:09,796
Sergei, bookmaking's a very
serious offense. What is that now,

552
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,046
Five years in prison?

553
00:23:11,096 --> 00:23:13,218
Oh, more if you take
the bets over the phone.

554
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:15,567
That's interstate wire fraud.

555
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,772
Who's gonna feed all those fish?

556
00:23:21,251 --> 00:23:22,713
Are you gonna start soon?

557
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,404
I already did.

558
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:27,923
What do you mean?

559
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:29,859
You don't feel it?

560
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:30,816
Feel what?

561
00:23:30,866 --> 00:23:31,762
The heat.

562
00:23:32,315 --> 00:23:33,373
See,

563
00:23:33,423 --> 00:23:34,817
I'm using what's called the, uh,

564
00:23:34,867 --> 00:23:36,169
Hovering technique.

565
00:23:36,219 --> 00:23:38,124
I learned it from
some monks in Cambodia.

566
00:23:38,257 --> 00:23:40,083
It's forbidden to touch the skin.

567
00:23:44,954 --> 00:23:46,585
Yeah,

568
00:23:47,156 --> 00:23:48,751
I think I feel it.

569
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:49,875
You do?

570
00:23:49,925 --> 00:23:52,251
I mean, good.

571
00:23:52,301 --> 00:23:54,886
Now what I want you to do

572
00:23:54,936 --> 00:23:56,829
Is close your eyes tight

573
00:23:56,879 --> 00:24:00,060
And focus on the power
source coming from my hands.

574
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,569
Yeah.

575
00:24:03,619 --> 00:24:05,688
Now I totally feel it.

576
00:24:06,357 --> 00:24:07,572
Aw, yeah.

577
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:09,094
That's awesome.

578
00:24:10,686 --> 00:24:11,938
Can you do the buttocks?

579
00:24:12,497 --> 00:24:14,482
The hover technique?

580
00:24:14,532 --> 00:24:16,583
Resourceful Gus makes a rare appearance.

581
00:24:16,633 --> 00:24:19,087
Please tell me you have something
so we can get out of here.

582
00:24:19,137 --> 00:24:21,084
Depends. What can you
tell me about poison oak?

583
00:24:21,134 --> 00:24:23,373
What can't I tell you?
It's the three-leaved devil.

584
00:24:23,575 --> 00:24:25,975
Causes severe itching
and a red bumpy rash.

585
00:24:26,025 --> 00:24:28,996
Found only on the pacific coast and
usually near bodies of fresh water.

586
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:33,553
<i>The foot was found
by hikers this morning</i>

587
00:24:33,554 --> 00:24:34,987
on a trail near Lake Cachuma.

588
00:24:35,234 --> 00:24:36,429
Come on.

589
00:24:36,748 --> 00:24:38,323
We gotta call the M.E.
And check something out.

590
00:24:38,373 --> 00:24:39,941
But I think I might know
where Vlad's body is.

591
00:24:39,991 --> 00:24:41,595
- How?
- Calamine lotion.

592
00:24:41,645 --> 00:24:42,968
Calamine lotion?

593
00:24:47,506 --> 00:24:49,071
All right, thanks.

594
00:24:49,314 --> 00:24:50,136
You were right.

595
00:24:50,186 --> 00:24:52,089
The m. E. Said the pink
flakes under Vlad's toenails

596
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,439
were dried calamine lotion.

597
00:24:53,635 --> 00:24:56,074
And this is the closest
lake to traing camp.

598
00:24:56,247 --> 00:24:58,047
Cops obviously got my message.

599
00:24:58,097 --> 00:24:58,927
What are you doing?

600
00:24:58,977 --> 00:24:59,912
It's game time.

601
00:24:59,962 --> 00:25:01,665
I'm about to blow their minds.

602
00:25:01,715 --> 00:25:02,646
How do I look?

603
00:25:02,696 --> 00:25:03,598
Like an idiot.

604
00:25:03,648 --> 00:25:05,157
Sweet.

605
00:25:08,582 --> 00:25:09,554
Sorry I'm late.

606
00:25:09,604 --> 00:25:11,023
Practice ran long.

607
00:25:11,073 --> 00:25:13,604
By the way, Jules, you might want
to jump on the Spencer bandwagon,

608
00:25:13,654 --> 00:25:15,968
Sign up for my newsletter,
maybe buy my fathead.

609
00:25:17,244 --> 00:25:19,266
Spencer, what are you doing here?

610
00:25:20,176 --> 00:25:21,595
It's Vlad's body.

611
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,449
It's dark, it's murky,

612
00:25:23,499 --> 00:25:25,255
His voice is
a little, uh--

613
00:25:25,305 --> 00:25:26,330
- Warbly.
- That's right.

614
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,396
Like it's calling to me from underwater.

615
00:25:28,446 --> 00:25:29,380
Maybe a

616
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,757
A river or stream.
Perhaps, a--

617
00:25:31,807 --> 00:25:33,232
Lake?

618
00:25:33,898 --> 00:25:35,998
Yeah, we pulled out
Vlad's body an hour ago.

619
00:25:39,887 --> 00:25:43,025
Mr. Spencer, it looks like you're
a little late to the game this time.

620
00:25:43,297 --> 00:25:45,078
What, no witty retort?

621
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:47,529
No reference to some obscure '80s film?

622
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:51,039
- O’Hara, write this down.
- I don't have a pen.

623
00:25:51,089 --> 00:25:52,929
Make note of the date and
time that I, Carlton Lassiter,

624
00:25:52,979 --> 00:25:55,921
Actually shut Shawn
Spencer’s cavernous piehole.

625
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:01,805
Sorry. What was that?

626
00:26:02,397 --> 00:26:04,534
Something about night of the comet.

627
00:26:04,584 --> 00:26:07,117
Just-- Just
forget it.

628
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:11,567
Okay, we need to expedite this.

629
00:26:11,617 --> 00:26:13,234
Make it a top priority.

630
00:26:13,284 --> 00:26:15,050
We received a tip that
Vlad had been using

631
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,851
An old girlfriend's cabin on the lake.

632
00:26:16,901 --> 00:26:18,758
When we went back and ran
some of his credit cards,

633
00:26:18,808 --> 00:26:21,705
We found out that one was used
at the cold spring gas station.

634
00:26:21,755 --> 00:26:22,994
On highway 154.

635
00:26:23,044 --> 00:26:25,828
Yup, and the attendant there said
that he'd rembered seeing Vlad

636
00:26:25,878 --> 00:26:28,231
Three days ago, and that he got
into a car with several other men.

637
00:26:28,281 --> 00:26:29,661
Which we assume is
our Russian connection.

638
00:26:29,711 --> 00:26:30,690
You see, boys,

639
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,957
At the end of the day,

640
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,817
Good old-fashioned police
work always wins out.

641
00:26:34,867 --> 00:26:35,838
Old-fashioned.

642
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:38,630
So you went and
Billy-clubbed some immigrants?

643
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,960
You know, Jules, it's a shame you
didn't see my kick at practice.

644
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:55,529
Yeah, sorry I missed it.

645
00:26:55,579 --> 00:26:57,190
I didn't.

646
00:26:57,606 --> 00:26:59,109
Ooh, I almost forgot.

647
00:27:00,796 --> 00:27:03,920
Just a little something to make
this whole police thing official.

648
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:06,552
Isn't this the same thing you
gave the former Laotian general

649
00:27:06,602 --> 00:27:08,121
Who sells peanuts outside the station?

650
00:27:08,171 --> 00:27:09,706
Yeah, but his actually
says detective on it.

651
00:27:09,756 --> 00:27:11,311
Chief, I need a favor.

652
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:13,827
Please don't release the info
about finding Vlad's body yet.

653
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:14,906
Come on.

654
00:27:14,956 --> 00:27:16,374
Give me one good reason.

655
00:27:16,424 --> 00:27:17,540
I'll give you five.

656
00:27:20,568 --> 00:27:21,733
I'll give you one.

657
00:27:21,783 --> 00:27:24,027
I know deep down in my psychic loins

658
00:27:24,077 --> 00:27:25,618
That the Russian angle
is completely wrong.

659
00:27:25,668 --> 00:27:27,806
Why, because all signs
point directly to it?

660
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:28,795
Exactly.

661
00:27:28,845 --> 00:27:30,332
Whoever did this thinks
they got away with it.

662
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,398
We release the info now,
they're just gonna run.

663
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,852
Give me one day.

664
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:37,643
It's gonna take us at least 24 hours
to find and notify them in Russia.

665
00:27:37,693 --> 00:27:39,116
That gives you one day.

666
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:40,255
Thank you, chief.

667
00:27:40,305 --> 00:27:41,561
Come on, Gus.

668
00:27:43,035 --> 00:27:44,156
Oh, lassie.

669
00:27:44,206 --> 00:27:47,301
Your haircut's worse than Joyce
Hyser's in just one of the guys.

670
00:27:47,513 --> 00:27:48,774
Thank you and good night.

671
00:27:55,952 --> 00:27:57,395
Why isn't my dad picking up?

672
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,117
Probably because you were
supposed to be at his house

673
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:00,706
Three hours ago for your apology dinner.

674
00:28:00,756 --> 00:28:02,133
Yeah, well, we'll have a late dinner.

675
00:28:02,183 --> 00:28:03,844
Late? It's already 10:00, Shawn.

676
00:28:03,894 --> 00:28:05,075
Way past curfew.

677
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:07,687
We're gonna get caught, and you
might end up losing your roster spot.

678
00:28:07,737 --> 00:28:08,724
Why did we come back here?

679
00:28:08,774 --> 00:28:11,077
Because the answer to what
happened to Vlad is with the team.

680
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:13,196
The warriors lied about
being friends with him.

681
00:28:13,246 --> 00:28:15,102
And Drew referred to
him in the past tense.

682
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:16,715
Yeah, we didn't really know him.

683
00:28:16,765 --> 00:28:19,006
So the guys were with Vlad at
the lake, but they lied about it.

684
00:28:19,056 --> 00:28:20,274
Exactly.

685
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:23,053
Something went down. I just don't
know what or who else was there.

686
00:28:23,103 --> 00:28:23,922
What do we do now?

687
00:28:23,972 --> 00:28:25,640
Be careful. There's a cover-up here.

688
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:28,772
A lot of guys hated Vlad.
Anybody could be involved.

689
00:28:46,728 --> 00:28:48,293
You guys know why you're here.

690
00:28:48,885 --> 00:28:50,352
You have two choices.

691
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:52,363
Dude, I think we're
on top of the stadium.

692
00:28:52,413 --> 00:28:53,588
Do not step forward.

693
00:28:53,638 --> 00:28:55,465
You can either jump

694
00:28:55,515 --> 00:28:57,093
Or get pushed off.

695
00:28:57,143 --> 00:28:58,779
You have five seconds to decide.

696
00:28:58,829 --> 00:29:00,190
Five...

697
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,633
four...

698
00:29:01,683 --> 00:29:02,732
three...

699
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,238
two...

700
00:29:04,613 --> 00:29:05,797
one!

701
00:29:06,071 --> 00:29:07,989
What do you think you're doing?

702
00:29:08,314 --> 00:29:09,226
Enough already.

703
00:29:09,276 --> 00:29:10,591
It's Matt and Vince.

704
00:29:10,641 --> 00:29:11,459
We might be screwed.

705
00:29:11,509 --> 00:29:12,827
Don't be an idiot.

706
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:14,507
You can blow this whole
thing for all of us.

707
00:29:14,557 --> 00:29:17,348
We're only trying to scare 'em.
Coach is not gonna find out.

708
00:29:17,577 --> 00:29:18,682
Hell, yes, he can.

709
00:29:18,732 --> 00:29:20,150
And there goes our contracts.

710
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:23,922
You get these guys off this
building and into their rooms now.

711
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:25,349
All right,

712
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:27,291
Guys, take the hoods off. Show's over.

713
00:29:32,252 --> 00:29:33,972
Sorry about that, guys.

714
00:29:34,364 --> 00:29:35,792
Beer?

715
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,336
What were you gonna do?

716
00:29:37,386 --> 00:29:38,415
Haze us?

717
00:29:38,465 --> 00:29:39,812
It's traing camp.

718
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:42,247
You know, it gets so intense,
you gotta cut loose a little.

719
00:29:42,297 --> 00:29:44,409
What was all that stuff
with Matt and Vince about?

720
00:29:44,459 --> 00:29:46,853
You don't have guaranteed contracts,
so you don't have to worry about that.

721
00:29:47,324 --> 00:29:48,884
Just don't tell coach what we did.

722
00:29:48,934 --> 00:29:50,347
All right?

723
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:52,804
Come on, guys.

724
00:29:56,324 --> 00:29:57,494
Oh, gosh.

725
00:29:57,544 --> 00:29:58,988
Dude,

726
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:00,478
I got it.

727
00:30:00,528 --> 00:30:02,774
We need to talk to Sammy.
He always works late.

728
00:30:02,824 --> 00:30:03,782
What about your dad?

729
00:30:03,832 --> 00:30:05,332
I'll figure that out on the way.

730
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,120
Shawn, you're not the person
I want to see right now.

731
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:13,041
I know, I know, and I'm sorry.

732
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:14,910
I'm gonna make it up to you, I promise.

733
00:30:15,071 --> 00:30:16,726
Uh, do
you--

734
00:30:16,901 --> 00:30:18,451
Do you still have that football,

735
00:30:18,501 --> 00:30:20,549
The Thunderbirds football
that I got when I was a kid?

736
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:22,960
I don't know. Maybe
up in the attic. Why?

737
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,590
I want him to sign it.

738
00:30:27,844 --> 00:30:30,627
Henry, that steak was
downright vicious, baby.

739
00:30:30,677 --> 00:30:32,414
I mean, thank you for having me over.

740
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:35,032
I-- You know, I don't rember the
last time I had a home-cooked meal.

741
00:30:35,531 --> 00:30:37,225
You kidding? Sammy Winslow at my house.

742
00:30:37,275 --> 00:30:38,553
I should be thanking you.

743
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:41,110
Or you could thank me,
since I brought him over, but

744
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,324
It's neither here nor there.

745
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:44,630
Do you know that Shawn and I used to
sit in that living room right there

746
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,175
And watch every single one of your
games? You remember that, Shawn?

747
00:30:47,225 --> 00:30:49,839
Remember? I remember I had
to stand next to the fridge

748
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,831
For the entire second half

749
00:30:51,881 --> 00:30:54,057
Of the playoff game
against Seattle in '88

750
00:30:54,107 --> 00:30:55,717
Because every time I got an otter pop,

751
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:57,018
You threw a touchdown.

752
00:30:57,068 --> 00:30:58,506
He didn't want to jinx it.

753
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:01,197
- Hey, we won, right?
- Yes, we did.

754
00:31:05,499 --> 00:31:09,327
I still can't believe that you let
Shawn talk you into this crazy plan.

755
00:31:09,585 --> 00:31:12,061
Well, you know, the kid
does have a way with words.

756
00:31:12,111 --> 00:31:15,348
I mean, I'm not sure if he's a
genius, or if he's totally full of it.

757
00:31:16,214 --> 00:31:18,277
Maybe he's a little bit of both.

758
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:23,778
Get us a couple more beers.

759
00:31:23,828 --> 00:31:25,286
- You got it.
- Thanks.

760
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,115
You know, I was thinking
about retiring this year.

761
00:31:36,525 --> 00:31:38,226
But now...

762
00:31:38,585 --> 00:31:40,478
I can't go out like this.

763
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:43,184
Everything I've done before
would just be forgotten.

764
00:31:44,479 --> 00:31:45,891
Sammy,
if--

765
00:31:45,941 --> 00:31:49,072
If you found out that you
had players that were hazing,

766
00:31:49,122 --> 00:31:51,067
What would you do about it?

767
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:53,755
Used to be I wouldn't do anything.

768
00:31:53,805 --> 00:31:55,328
But that all changed last year

769
00:31:55,378 --> 00:31:58,155
When I put behavior clauses
in everybody's contract.

770
00:31:58,156 --> 00:31:59,594
What do you mean?

771
00:31:59,644 --> 00:32:02,013
Well, we had so many guys
getting in trouble off the field,

772
00:32:02,063 --> 00:32:03,815
You know, getting arrested,

773
00:32:04,013 --> 00:32:07,370
Driving their motorcycles through
honeybaked ham stores, stuff like that.

774
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,220
So...

775
00:32:08,232 --> 00:32:09,684
I put a thing in everyone's deal

776
00:32:09,734 --> 00:32:12,236
That says if they get caught
doing any of that stuff,

777
00:32:12,853 --> 00:32:14,251
That I can cut them.

778
00:32:14,301 --> 00:32:15,431
No exceptions.

779
00:32:15,481 --> 00:32:16,361
None.

780
00:32:16,411 --> 00:32:18,774
The only thing they respond to is fear.

781
00:32:19,085 --> 00:32:20,712
Fear of losing their money.

782
00:32:21,136 --> 00:32:23,603
I think we should put
that fear to work for us.

783
00:32:40,832 --> 00:32:41,971
<i>Good job, boys!</i>

784
00:32:42,021 --> 00:32:43,313
<i>Hold up.</i>

785
00:32:43,688 --> 00:32:44,956
<i>Hold up!</i>

786
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:47,975
<i>Well, Vlad's death
is a horrible tragedy.</i>

787
00:32:48,172 --> 00:32:50,412
<i>We're working with the Santa
Barbara police department to...</i>

788
00:32:50,462 --> 00:32:52,180
help in any way that we can.

789
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,910
And we voted as a team to

790
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,001
Continue to practice and to play,

791
00:32:56,051 --> 00:32:58,223
And that is what we're
going to do. Thank you.

792
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:00,171
At least tell us who
the kicker's gonna be.

793
00:33:00,221 --> 00:33:01,762
Thank you.

794
00:33:03,831 --> 00:33:05,957
You know, I hope you know
what you're doing, kid.

795
00:33:06,007 --> 00:33:07,300
You got
my career--

796
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,931
Hell, you got my legacy in your hands.

797
00:33:08,981 --> 00:33:10,029
Sammy,

798
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:12,036
You're just gonna
have to trust me, okay?

799
00:33:12,086 --> 00:33:13,689
I'm gonna fix this.

800
00:33:20,925 --> 00:33:22,217
You didn't even look at the ball.

801
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:23,659
You ain't mad at it, though.

802
00:33:33,215 --> 00:33:34,935
We're four weeks from our first game.

803
00:33:34,985 --> 00:33:36,590
You're still pulling
this? Come on, baby.

804
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,974
Come on! Focus men!

805
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,286
Dude,

806
00:33:39,336 --> 00:33:40,861
Matt and Drew are getting into it.

807
00:33:40,911 --> 00:33:42,829
I think the pressure's getting to them.

808
00:33:42,879 --> 00:33:44,085
Where are your John Stockton shorts?

809
00:33:44,135 --> 00:33:45,837
They're not John Stockton shorts, Shawn.

810
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:48,441
I changed because I just got
off the phone with Juliet.

811
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:50,490
She wants us to come down
to the station right now.

812
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,677
Check this out. According to her,

813
00:33:52,727 --> 00:33:54,047
Vlad wasn't murdered.

814
00:33:54,048 --> 00:33:55,027
What?

815
00:33:55,077 --> 00:33:56,011
Say that again.

816
00:33:56,061 --> 00:33:57,333
Use a Jamaican accent.

817
00:33:57,383 --> 00:33:59,735
Me said Vlad no murder.
The murder thing can't work.

818
00:33:59,785 --> 00:34:01,553
No, man. The
man's feet--

819
00:34:01,603 --> 00:34:03,421
- Shawn.
- All right, let's go.

820
00:34:04,651 --> 00:34:06,994
And according to the
coroner, Vlad's injuries

821
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:08,361
Were more consistent

822
00:34:08,411 --> 00:34:10,452
With those of a motor vehicle accident.

823
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,928
Well, my psychic wires are crossed then.

824
00:34:12,978 --> 00:34:14,886
'Cause I can see Vlad's body,

825
00:34:14,936 --> 00:34:17,966
But I don't see any shards of
glass or cuts on it anywhere.

826
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:19,393
Good catch. I'm glad I called you.

827
00:34:19,443 --> 00:34:21,292
Are you sure you didn't call
me to see me in my uniform?

828
00:34:21,342 --> 00:34:25,012
'Cause I got a glimpse of myself in the
mirror earlier, and I was like wha-at!

829
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,662
I didn't know they made
pads in extra small.

830
00:34:28,148 --> 00:34:29,272
Hey.

831
00:34:29,322 --> 00:34:30,472
Dead Russian guy.

832
00:34:30,522 --> 00:34:32,341
Possible homicidal football players.

833
00:34:32,391 --> 00:34:34,067
Right. Sorry, Gus.

834
00:34:36,346 --> 00:34:37,997
- Where did this come from?
- They're Vlad's.

835
00:34:50,782 --> 00:34:52,331
I'm getting something here.

836
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:55,274
Older republican walruses.

837
00:34:55,582 --> 00:34:58,491
No, that doesn't make any sense.
Everyone knows walruses are libertarian.

838
00:34:58,541 --> 00:35:00,810
Off-- Off--
Off-- Offlagen.

839
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,855
Off-- Off--
Rixper--

840
00:35:02,905 --> 00:35:04,830
Off--
On-- Off--

841
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,247
- Shawn.
- Off-road warriors.

842
00:35:08,297 --> 00:35:10,056
Off-road like atv.

843
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:12,943
You know what, atvs
don't have windshields.

844
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,572
We have to go.

845
00:35:25,116 --> 00:35:26,380
<i>All right, I think I know what happened,</i>

846
00:35:26,381 --> 00:35:27,455
but I need a little more proof.

847
00:35:27,505 --> 00:35:29,824
I don't understand the big
deal about the time of death.

848
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,055
It happened between 4:00 and
6:00 on Thursday the 14th.

849
00:35:32,105 --> 00:35:34,956
That text came in five
hours after he already died.

850
00:35:35,006 --> 00:35:36,959
Would you send a threatening
text message to someone

851
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,397
Hours after you supposedly killed them?

852
00:35:38,447 --> 00:35:40,464
You would if you were
starting the cover-up.

853
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:42,434
What do you think you're gonna
find in Matt and Vince's locker?

854
00:35:42,484 --> 00:35:44,673
Something that ties
them directly to Vlad.

855
00:35:45,483 --> 00:35:46,914
Looks like someone beat us to it.

856
00:35:46,964 --> 00:35:48,091
It's not one of their lockers.

857
00:35:48,141 --> 00:35:49,273
Whose is it?

858
00:35:49,323 --> 00:35:50,708
It's mine.

859
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:58,423
Why did you even have to
keep that stupid thing?

860
00:35:58,473 --> 00:36:00,529
It's my only form of I. D., Gus.

861
00:36:00,579 --> 00:36:02,200
Hey.

862
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,083
Hey, bros. What's up?

863
00:36:04,133 --> 00:36:05,358
What's up?

864
00:36:05,408 --> 00:36:07,394
What's up is we know
you're not a kicker.

865
00:36:07,444 --> 00:36:09,825
You guys saw me nail a
69-footer a couple days ago.

866
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,447
Then what the hell are you
doing working for the cops?

867
00:36:12,497 --> 00:36:14,239
Okay, okay.

868
00:36:14,289 --> 00:36:15,900
So maybe I'm not a player,

869
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:18,792
I'm not a player, but I crush a lot.

870
00:36:19,688 --> 00:36:21,298
Wow, I would have bet money they
would have gotten that reference.

871
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:22,795
- I got it.
- Thanks, buddy.

872
00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:26,686
All right, the jig is up. I'm
a psychic. I work for the cops.

873
00:36:26,975 --> 00:36:28,552
You know what, I'm tired
of you messing with us.

874
00:36:28,602 --> 00:36:30,856
Whoa, whoa-whoa.
What was that?

875
00:36:30,857 --> 00:36:32,324
I said I'm tired of
you messing with us.

876
00:36:32,374 --> 00:36:34,428
Not you.

877
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,183
It's Vlad.

878
00:36:39,233 --> 00:36:41,383
He's speaking to me.
He's in a dark place.

879
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:44,786
It's hard to understand him. He
sounds a little like Yaakov Smirnoff.

880
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:47,414
He also has some ritz bits in his mouth.

881
00:36:47,464 --> 00:36:49,397
Cheese, no, peanut butter.

882
00:36:49,447 --> 00:36:51,362
- Shawn.
- Okay, I'll tell 'em.

883
00:36:51,412 --> 00:36:52,714
I said I'd tell 'em.

884
00:36:52,764 --> 00:36:55,745
All right, Vlad says he
knows it's an accident.

885
00:36:57,294 --> 00:36:59,495
Oh, I'm seeing through Vlad's eyes now.

886
00:36:59,545 --> 00:37:02,294
He invited you to go
atving down by the lake.

887
00:37:02,723 --> 00:37:03,729
You were drinking.

888
00:37:03,779 --> 00:37:05,442
There was a horrible
accident where Vlad and Matt

889
00:37:05,492 --> 00:37:08,467
Smashed into each other like
two frozen Christmas hams.

890
00:37:08,468 --> 00:37:10,095
Vlad wasn't wearing his helmet.

891
00:37:10,414 --> 00:37:12,652
Hit his head on a rock, and
by the time we got there,

892
00:37:12,988 --> 00:37:14,234
- He was dead.
- Shut up, Drew.

893
00:37:14,284 --> 00:37:16,710
Matt, you were thrown
so violently from the atv

894
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,978
That the emergency switch tethered to
your wrist left a burn just like Vlad.

895
00:37:20,028 --> 00:37:21,265
And the foot,
the foot--

896
00:37:22,135 --> 00:37:23,648
Just got ripped off in
the middle of the accident.

897
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,558
But you weren't supposed
to be doing any of that,

898
00:37:25,608 --> 00:37:27,942
So you had to cover it up
or risk losing your contract,

899
00:37:27,992 --> 00:37:29,073
And that's worth millions.

900
00:37:29,123 --> 00:37:31,426
- Smallpox, wrapping
up the wrap-up. - What?

901
00:37:31,476 --> 00:37:33,653
- Putting a bow on it.
- The pox may be small--

902
00:37:33,703 --> 00:37:36,698
Yeah, that's really, really
very, very impressive, guys.

903
00:37:37,104 --> 00:37:38,625
Too bad we've already
dug ourselves so deep

904
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:40,400
We can't let you ever
tell anyone about it.

905
00:37:40,775 --> 00:37:42,005
Then again,

906
00:37:42,055 --> 00:37:43,172
- I could be dead wrong.
- Yup.

907
00:37:43,222 --> 00:37:45,323
I mean, I just-- I just
heard it all from a locker.

908
00:37:45,373 --> 00:37:46,608
What the hell does it know?

909
00:37:46,658 --> 00:37:48,336
Seriously, here's what I
think we should do, guys.

910
00:37:48,386 --> 00:37:49,414
- Gus, run.
- Yup.

911
00:37:58,342 --> 00:37:59,718
Gus! This way!

912
00:38:02,498 --> 00:38:04,822
We'll use the phone in the press box.

913
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,577
Come on, Gus, this is
what we worked so hard for.

914
00:38:08,655 --> 00:38:10,934
I was a training intern, Shawn!

915
00:38:15,445 --> 00:38:17,530
Guess you guys didn't
know about the elevator.

916
00:38:21,403 --> 00:38:23,314
- Wait!
- Get over there.

917
00:38:23,364 --> 00:38:25,381
- What are we doing, Matt?
- Yeah, what are you doing, Matt?

918
00:38:25,431 --> 00:38:29,438
Don't be rash and stupid now after you
covered up the Vlad accident so nicely.

919
00:38:29,627 --> 00:38:31,457
That's right.
I know.

920
00:38:31,458 --> 00:38:32,258
What the hell happened?

921
00:38:32,259 --> 00:38:34,279
I sensed a plan being hatched
right there in the moment.

922
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:36,295
You knew Vlad was in
trouble with the Russians.

923
00:38:36,345 --> 00:38:37,964
You guys decided that
would be the story.

924
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,106
You dumped Vlad's body in the lake,

925
00:38:40,156 --> 00:38:42,242
And you left the foot right out there,

926
00:38:42,292 --> 00:38:43,509
Where you were sure it would be found.

927
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,605
You gave the cops
exactly what they wanted.

928
00:38:46,242 --> 00:38:49,276
It was the text, man, the text
to Vlad's phone afterwards.

929
00:38:49,326 --> 00:38:51,203
That was overkill. That's what cost you.

930
00:38:51,253 --> 00:38:52,464
We have to get rid of 'em, Matt.

931
00:38:52,514 --> 00:38:53,540
No, you don't.

932
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,569
We know you're not murderers.
It was just an accident.

933
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:57,858
- Yeah, that we covered up.
- Yeah.

934
00:38:57,908 --> 00:38:59,718
You can forget about our contracts.

935
00:38:59,768 --> 00:39:00,573
We're going to jail.

936
00:39:00,623 --> 00:39:03,580
Jail's not so bad.
Haveyou guys seen "Stir crazy"?

937
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,570
I bet they'll let you ride bulls.

938
00:39:05,607 --> 00:39:06,407
All right

939
00:39:06,408 --> 00:39:07,719
We'll take 'em up to the roof,

940
00:39:07,769 --> 00:39:09,796
Make 'em jump. It'll look
like a hazing gone bad.

941
00:39:09,846 --> 00:39:11,965
- Come on.
- No, no, no.

942
00:39:12,015 --> 00:39:14,570
Hey, hey-hey. Let go of 'em.

943
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:16,004
Coach.

944
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,970
Son.

945
00:39:18,426 --> 00:39:19,824
What are you doing here?

946
00:39:19,874 --> 00:39:22,101
Watching film in the coach's box,

947
00:39:22,102 --> 00:39:23,747
like he does every night before a game.

948
00:39:23,905 --> 00:39:26,359
Yeah, and I heard everything.

949
00:39:26,409 --> 00:39:28,363
Coach, come on.

950
00:39:28,413 --> 00:39:29,664
Think about this.

951
00:39:29,714 --> 00:39:31,938
Giving up three of your starters for...

952
00:39:31,988 --> 00:39:33,516
- these guys?
- Yeah

953
00:39:33,566 --> 00:39:35,474
You can't win without us.

954
00:39:37,478 --> 00:39:39,043
You're probably right.

955
00:39:40,304 --> 00:39:41,681
What?

956
00:39:41,731 --> 00:39:43,706
But that doesn't matter anymore.

957
00:39:44,637 --> 00:39:46,663
Shawn, you and your dad are people who

958
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:49,822
Love football so much you'd
do anything to be close to it.

959
00:39:50,551 --> 00:39:53,072
And that made me realize
what's most important.

960
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,359
The game.

961
00:39:55,963 --> 00:39:57,629
To hell with you, old man.

962
00:39:57,679 --> 00:39:58,970
We'll just get rid of you too.

963
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,044
No, no, no.
You don't--

964
00:40:00,094 --> 00:40:01,620
Well! Freeze.

965
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,055
Cop!

966
00:40:06,856 --> 00:40:08,603
You think I'd do all this
without having back-up?

967
00:40:08,653 --> 00:40:10,148
I'm not stupid.

968
00:40:10,198 --> 00:40:12,552
They don't give these
badges to just anybody.

969
00:40:12,602 --> 00:40:14,044
Feel it.

970
00:40:14,094 --> 00:40:15,502
You guys did good.

971
00:40:16,281 --> 00:40:17,568
I'm proud of you.

972
00:40:17,618 --> 00:40:19,395
Thanks, Sammy.

973
00:40:19,445 --> 00:40:20,693
It looks like you...

974
00:40:20,743 --> 00:40:22,563
might need a few extra
players for the season.

975
00:40:22,613 --> 00:40:23,439
No.

976
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:24,641
- But, you know--
- You know--

977
00:40:24,691 --> 00:40:26,609
- It's not gonna happen.
- Just hear me out.

978
00:40:26,659 --> 00:40:28,039
Never.

979
00:40:29,632 --> 00:40:32,687
<i>Hello, everyone. Welcome to
thunder dome for opening night,</i>

980
00:40:32,737 --> 00:40:36,597
<i>As hope springs eternal for coach
Sammy Winslow and the T-birds.</i>

981
00:40:36,944 --> 00:40:39,237
You know, I can't believe I'm
actually letting him do this.

982
00:40:39,287 --> 00:40:40,411
You remember back then I told you

983
00:40:40,412 --> 00:40:43,273
he was a perceptive
little pain in the butt?

984
00:40:43,323 --> 00:40:47,976
I probably should have also told
you that he is persistent as hell.

985
00:40:53,111 --> 00:40:55,323
- Ready?
- Are you kidding me?

986
00:40:55,373 --> 00:40:58,400
I've never been more ready
for anything in my life.

987
00:40:59,736 --> 00:41:02,045
Ready to lead 'em out, son.

988
00:41:02,095 --> 00:41:03,822
Thunderbirds!

989
00:41:03,872 --> 00:41:05,829
This is our house!

990
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,872
This is our time!

991
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,537
It's game time!

992
00:41:20,157 --> 00:41:22,881
Gus, it's my day off. The case is over.

993
00:41:22,931 --> 00:41:25,951
What do you and Shawn
want me to see anyway?

994
00:41:26,816 --> 00:41:28,601
That.

995
00:41:31,726 --> 00:41:33,072
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

996
00:41:33,122 --> 00:41:36,897
<i>Here come your los Angeles Thunderbirds!</i>
