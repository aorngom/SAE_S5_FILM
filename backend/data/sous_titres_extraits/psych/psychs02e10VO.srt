1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,181
No one ever gets their ball back
from mean old man Fuller's yard.

2
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:11,892
This sucks.

3
00:00:14,784 --> 00:00:15,887
I know.

4
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:19,057
We were tied 114 to 114.

5
00:00:19,113 --> 00:00:20,732
And I was up.

6
00:00:20,794 --> 00:00:24,099
We weren't supposed
to be playing with my new ball.

7
00:00:24,381 --> 00:00:27,104
I'll give you 1,000 outs
if you go get it.

8
00:00:27,613 --> 00:00:29,300
- 2,000.
- Done.

9
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:34,100
Okay, you got it, all right,

10
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:36,231
almost got it. There I go...

11
00:00:38,027 --> 00:00:39,435
- Gus!
- Shawn!

12
00:00:39,492 --> 00:00:41,752
- Is the ball all right?
- I can't get back over.

13
00:00:41,827 --> 00:00:43,217
Get that ball off my grass!

14
00:00:43,298 --> 00:00:45,635
- Get out of my yard!
- Gus, I'm really gonna Miss ya.

15
00:00:49,581 --> 00:00:51,393
Ho, buzz McNab.

16
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,813
The christmas spirits told
me to give this to you.

17
00:00:56,164 --> 00:00:58,867
Oh, my goodness, a Daisy Red Ryder.

18
00:00:59,008 --> 00:01:00,631
I had one of these when I was a kid.

19
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:03,316
It was the reason I wanted
to become a policeman.

20
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,559
Well, merry christmas
from me and Gus.

21
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:06,883
Thanks, guys.

22
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,498
- He's gonna shoot his eye out.
- Yes, he is.

23
00:01:10,643 --> 00:01:11,985
That was amazing.

24
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,799
How did you know that?

25
00:01:13,862 --> 00:01:15,828
Uh, the room where I take naps
shares a vent

26
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,194
with the room where they do
the psychological evals.

27
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,315
Lassie!

28
00:01:26,497 --> 00:01:28,046
I-I hate snow globes.

29
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:30,894
Now, that's strange.
My psychic senses told me

30
00:01:30,981 --> 00:01:33,499
specifically that snow globes
didn't give you nightmares

31
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:36,486
About being trapped in a clear ball
with snow that burns your skin off.

32
00:01:39,627 --> 00:01:42,077
Well, merry christmas from me and Gus.

33
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,013
Mr. Mittens says it felt just
like going to sleep,

34
00:01:48,097 --> 00:01:49,867
and he doesn't hold
it against you at all.

35
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:51,545
Kitty Heaven...

36
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,618
It's just like east beach.

37
00:01:53,684 --> 00:01:55,562
That is the best news ever.

38
00:01:55,656 --> 00:01:56,923
Merry christmas

39
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:58,201
from both of...

40
00:01:58,835 --> 00:02:01,169
This is a very special gift.
It's clearly just from me.

41
00:02:01,248 --> 00:02:03,135
Don't appropriate. Not at christmas time.

42
00:02:03,258 --> 00:02:05,492
Thank you so much, Shawn.

43
00:02:05,563 --> 00:02:07,169
'Tis the season, Jules.

44
00:02:08,597 --> 00:02:12,516
This is exactly what I need to get into
the holiday spirit before my family arrives.

45
00:02:12,582 --> 00:02:14,958
Oh, should I meet them, or is it too soon?

46
00:02:15,047 --> 00:02:16,521
Too soon for what?

47
00:02:17,461 --> 00:02:18,456
Nothing.

48
00:02:19,823 --> 00:02:21,521
O'Hara's family christmas, huh?

49
00:02:21,618 --> 00:02:26,521
My family's christmas are the best
with tradional's scolish, games

50
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:28,582
and music and crafts.

51
00:02:28,663 --> 00:02:30,738
You guys should totally
come by tonight if you'd like.

52
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,457
I do love a scottish craft.

53
00:02:33,616 --> 00:02:36,353
But, uh, my father and I
have been invited over

54
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:38,139
to the Gusters for an
old-fashioned holiday dinner.

55
00:02:38,453 --> 00:02:39,570
Maybe next time.

56
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:43,126
I can think of someone who could use
a little cheer this time of year.

57
00:02:43,248 --> 00:02:44,999
Recently divorced.

58
00:02:45,023 --> 00:02:46,600
Separated. Estranged?

59
00:02:46,877 --> 00:02:48,445
- Embattled?
- Yes.

60
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,215
And all alone
for the holidays.

61
00:02:53,033 --> 00:02:54,188
All right!

62
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,911
Who keeps telling people
I want snow globesfor christmas?

63
00:03:02,793 --> 00:03:05,400
Dude, I am really stoked.

64
00:03:05,456 --> 00:03:07,634
In over 20 years
of friendship, I can count

65
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:09,249
on one shop teacher's hand,
the number of times

66
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,576
your folks have had us over.

67
00:03:10,651 --> 00:03:13,437
I assume it's because they can't
stand my father. Understandably.

68
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,572
Well, I wouldn't
necessarily say that.

69
00:03:15,647 --> 00:03:16,946
What would you say necessarily?

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,158
Let's just say it's not
because of your dad.

71
00:03:19,222 --> 00:03:21,153
Your house is too small?

72
00:03:21,313 --> 00:03:22,975
- Didn't have enough extra chairs?
- No.

73
00:03:23,226 --> 00:03:25,151
- Hiding a jewish family in your attic?
- No.

74
00:03:26,654 --> 00:03:28,200
Wait a minute.

75
00:03:28,585 --> 00:03:30,300
It's not because of me.

76
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:32,600
Gus?

77
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,100
I can't believe this.

78
00:03:34,343 --> 00:03:37,409
I feel like pe le pew when he
looked up pew in the dictionary.

79
00:03:37,512 --> 00:03:39,080
Le pew. Whuh?

80
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,173
No.

81
00:03:40,258 --> 00:03:42,525
My parents always thought
you were a bad influence on me.

82
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,679
- Understandably.
- A bad influence?

83
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:46,724
- Yes.
- Dude, that's absurd.

84
00:03:46,897 --> 00:03:51,065
Because of you, Shawn, I got my first "b,"
broke my first curfew, accidentally killed

85
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:52,141
the state bird...

86
00:03:52,216 --> 00:03:54,143
How was I supposed to know
he couldn't hold his own liquor?

87
00:03:54,246 --> 00:03:55,646
Now I know what to get
your parents for christmas.

88
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:56,124
What?

89
00:03:56,181 --> 00:03:58,078
I'm gonna lead 'em on a walk
down memory lane,

90
00:03:58,172 --> 00:04:00,771
and give them the gift of seeing
what a positive influence

91
00:04:00,822 --> 00:04:02,455
I have been on their son.

92
00:04:04,814 --> 00:04:08,574
Dad, why do you insist
on getting a real tree?

93
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,954
You probably chopped down
some poor animal's home.

94
00:04:11,057 --> 00:04:13,850
Yeah, that's the vicious
little bastard right there.

95
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,140
- Can we go, please?
- Whoa, Shawn, Shawn?

96
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:21,006
Look, I don't wanna be late to the Gusters.
It's important that this dinner go well.

97
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,583
Aren't you forgetting something?

98
00:04:23,277 --> 00:04:24,389
Your gift.

99
00:04:25,175 --> 00:04:27,181
Go on. Shake it, rattle it,
feel it, sniff it.

100
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:29,764
Do whatever the hell you want with it
before it goes in that stocking.

101
00:04:29,848 --> 00:04:31,754
Then you got one week to figure
out what it is.

102
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,354
Dad, this ridiculous competion means
way more to you than it does to me.

103
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,260
That's why you haven't won since
you were eight-years-old.

104
00:04:37,316 --> 00:04:38,528
Christmas '92 was a draw.

105
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,583
- You know that.
- Oh, so you do care.

106
00:04:40,826 --> 00:04:42,056
Go on.

107
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:48,713
That's it.

108
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,586
That's it?

109
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,776
- You're sure?
- That's all I need.

110
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,000
Oh, here's yours.

111
00:04:53,874 --> 00:04:55,057
Merry christmas.

112
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,077
- You are never...
- Shh.

113
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,430
Wait-wait-wait.

114
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:08,476
All right, time's up.
In the stockings they go.

115
00:05:08,532 --> 00:05:10,387
I'm gonna figure it out, Shawn. I always do.

116
00:05:13,035 --> 00:05:14,252
Same time.

117
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:22,172
Oh, I think there's a surprise
in here for someone.

118
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,502
I'm grown. You don't have
to do this every year.

119
00:05:24,577 --> 00:05:26,376
We hear you, son,
we hear ya.

120
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,053
And we're sure you're very happy
still being a sales rep.

121
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:29,799
I am.

122
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:32,049
Pharmaceutical sales
is a very desirable field.

123
00:05:32,313 --> 00:05:34,762
Of course, and you're doing
very well for yourself.

124
00:05:34,905 --> 00:05:36,977
That's $100, boy.

125
00:05:39,137 --> 00:05:40,893
No. Not gonna happen.

126
00:05:40,996 --> 00:05:42,518
Turkey's ready!

127
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,505
- Finally!
- It smells good, Winnie.

128
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,198
Why smell it
when you can taste it?

129
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:50,658
Speaking of smoked turkey,
you know why Gus isn't a smoker?

130
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:52,123
'cause when we were kids
I made him smoke

131
00:05:52,188 --> 00:05:55,412
an entire pack of cigarettes,
and he discovered he hated the taste.

132
00:05:55,497 --> 00:05:57,372
Pretty good influence
if I do say so myself.

133
00:05:57,428 --> 00:05:58,921
Probably what gave him asthma.

134
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,799
Probably what stunted
his growth too.

135
00:06:00,885 --> 00:06:02,435
I'm five-ten-and-a-half.

136
00:06:02,482 --> 00:06:03,499
We hear you, son.

137
00:06:03,546 --> 00:06:04,635
We hear ya.

138
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:06,485
Gus, you're tall enough.
Shawn, you're an idiot, and to be fair,

139
00:06:06,551 --> 00:06:08,798
there's a lot of
complicated causes for asthma.

140
00:06:08,847 --> 00:06:09,504
Now, let's eat.

141
00:06:09,551 --> 00:06:11,997
You know, it was actually Gus'
asthma medication

142
00:06:12,184 --> 00:06:14,453
that first interested him
in pharmaceuticals.

143
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,601
- So you're welcome for that.
- You made your point, Shawn.

144
00:06:17,685 --> 00:06:19,707
- You're a good friend.
- Yes, you're very close.

145
00:06:19,773 --> 00:06:22,355
So close, I wonder
if he wouldn't be married by now

146
00:06:22,402 --> 00:06:24,313
if he wasn't spending
so much time

147
00:06:24,607 --> 00:06:25,698
with you.

148
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:27,339
Trust me. I get mine.

149
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,061
I mean...
I'm just waiting for Mrs. Right.

150
00:06:31,342 --> 00:06:33,531
We at least thought you'd have
a house by now.

151
00:06:33,587 --> 00:06:35,543
I have time. The market's still cooling off.

152
00:06:35,618 --> 00:06:36,465
Yeah. So's the food.

153
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:38,395
You won't have time
if you keep using

154
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:40,047
all your extra energy
with this gypsy

155
00:06:40,113 --> 00:06:42,479
detective agency nonsense
you two have cooked up.

156
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,843
Mrs. G.

157
00:06:44,296 --> 00:06:46,390
It's a psychic detective agency.

158
00:06:48,085 --> 00:06:48,977
Psych.

159
00:06:49,052 --> 00:06:52,372
And how does this differ from that pet
baptism business you had as kids?

160
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:56,420
First of all, that was an llc. And I'm
the one that let Gus believe

161
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:58,904
that jesus was black. The whole time
we were grow...

162
00:06:59,017 --> 00:07:00,320
Growing up,
which of course he is.

163
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:01,450
He is that.

164
00:07:04,732 --> 00:07:05,793
That... he is that.

165
00:07:05,848 --> 00:07:07,444
I say we skip
old man Fuller's house.

166
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,686
Nobody wants to sing
to his old, mean behind.

167
00:07:09,742 --> 00:07:11,857
Can't hear the song
over his cussing anyway.

168
00:07:12,477 --> 00:07:14,280
Oh, come on, you guys!

169
00:07:14,853 --> 00:07:16,345
We're all adults now.

170
00:07:16,468 --> 00:07:18,679
Can't we let bygones be bygones?

171
00:07:18,726 --> 00:07:21,527
Even old man Fuller
can use some christmas spirit!

172
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:22,784
Come on!

173
00:07:22,897 --> 00:07:25,042
O/~ we wish you a merry christmas o/~

185
00:08:12,444 --> 00:08:15,445
yeah, it's an apparent suicide, but,
uh, we're still working the scene.

186
00:08:35,108 --> 00:08:38,439
Dude, what if
this wasn't suicide?

187
00:08:39,071 --> 00:08:40,629
What if this was murder?

188
00:08:40,695 --> 00:08:42,085
Shawn, it's christmas time.

189
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,722
- Can you please leave work at the office?
- They've already moved on.

190
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:47,488
Look, there is no way
that an 80-year-old man

191
00:08:47,535 --> 00:08:49,036
in Fuller's condition
could have hoisted himself

192
00:08:49,092 --> 00:08:50,437
over that bannister.

193
00:08:50,827 --> 00:08:51,897
And check it out.

194
00:08:52,264 --> 00:08:54,951
He was clearly looking forward
to watching some tv tonight.

195
00:08:55,198 --> 00:08:57,038
While he ate his lobster.

196
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:02,080
- You may be on to something.
- Plus, I psych it up nice for your parents,

197
00:09:02,155 --> 00:09:04,695
they might be impressed,
you know?

198
00:09:04,798 --> 00:09:05,845
Throw in a little razzle dazzle.

199
00:09:05,898 --> 00:09:07,897
Maybe they realize I'm not such
a bad influence after all.

200
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,354
Which may get them off my case for
deciding to go into business with you.

201
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,628
Now you're feeling me,
you convertible lebaron.

202
00:09:15,063 --> 00:09:16,390
Are you guys coming or what?

203
00:09:16,493 --> 00:09:17,614
Sure thing, pop.

204
00:09:20,712 --> 00:09:21,632
Stop!

205
00:09:22,718 --> 00:09:24,099
I'm sensing something.

206
00:09:25,158 --> 00:09:26,304
What is it, Shawn?

207
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,111
Is it like the other 26 and a half crimes
we solved for the police department?

208
00:09:30,225 --> 00:09:31,586
I'm sensing a struggle.

209
00:09:36,634 --> 00:09:38,281
Oh, please!

210
00:09:41,237 --> 00:09:42,498
Fuller's unconscious.

211
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:45,951
No, he was just an old man
with a little soft skull.

212
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,328
Oh, someone's wrapping a rope
around his neck!

213
00:09:51,394 --> 00:09:53,832
What I'm sensing here,
ladies and gentlemen,

214
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,436
is murder.

215
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,216
Spencer, old people are always
offing themselves during the holidays.

216
00:09:59,263 --> 00:10:01,901
Well, according to csu,
Shawn might be right.

217
00:10:02,048 --> 00:10:03,297
Colorado state university?

218
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:04,691
Crime scene unit.

219
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:06,478
- Them too.
- Let me see that.

220
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:09,192
Blunt force trauma,
signs of struggle.

221
00:10:09,494 --> 00:10:10,799
My lord.

222
00:10:10,874 --> 00:10:12,095
He really is psychic.

223
00:10:12,189 --> 00:10:14,536
Maybe we were wrong
about the boys working together...

224
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:15,748
This time.

225
00:10:16,602 --> 00:10:17,964
Right. Get him outta here.

226
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,429
It's an open crime scene,
people,

227
00:10:19,483 --> 00:10:22,614
I need witness statements
from each and every oneof you carolers.

228
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,985
Crap, I'm running late.

229
00:10:24,032 --> 00:10:26,595
Lassie, come on, man.
Handle your business.

230
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,852
Gus and I will take 'em down
to the station tomorrow.

231
00:10:28,913 --> 00:10:30,472
- We have passes...
- Which practically

232
00:10:30,556 --> 00:10:32,650
makes us co-workers.
Isn't that right, big l?

233
00:10:37,618 --> 00:10:38,726
That hurt, man!

234
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:43,318
But when they cut us,
we bleed blue.

235
00:10:47,644 --> 00:10:49,099
Carlton!

236
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,099
Hi!

237
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:52,127
I'm so glad
you could make it!

238
00:10:53,758 --> 00:10:56,199
I hope you're
in a hogmanay mood.I doubt it.

239
00:10:56,284 --> 00:10:57,999
Whatever that is.

240
00:10:58,088 --> 00:10:59,130
The first footer!

241
00:11:02,304 --> 00:11:05,191
Oh, the first footer,
it's scottish tradition

242
00:11:05,294 --> 00:11:07,191
to celebrate the first visitor
of the holidays.

243
00:11:07,261 --> 00:11:08,190
You.

244
00:11:11,499 --> 00:11:13,195
Why are they all
staring at me?

245
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,289
Well, the first footer
traditionally brings a gift of food.

246
00:11:17,896 --> 00:11:20,300
All I've got is
a cliff bar in my car.

247
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:22,933
I'd really prefer
to save it for my morning run.

248
00:11:23,144 --> 00:11:26,684
So these are my nephews.

249
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,399
Drake, Finn, and Isaac.

250
00:11:28,464 --> 00:11:30,483
Boys, this is detective Lassiter.

251
00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:32,161
He works with auntie Julie.

252
00:11:34,007 --> 00:11:35,566
I like it better
in here already.

253
00:11:36,045 --> 00:11:37,754
I was helping them
with their christmas crafts.

254
00:11:37,801 --> 00:11:39,599
It's always my favorite part.

255
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,242
Look at this,
auntie julie!

256
00:11:41,298 --> 00:11:43,720
- Look at mine!
- Oh, my goodness.

257
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,129
This looks fantastic,
but you know,

258
00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:49,717
maybe detective Lassiter
would like to help out.

259
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:52,499
Sure.

260
00:11:54,242 --> 00:11:56,608
All right, fellas,
what do we got going on here?

261
00:11:57,205 --> 00:11:59,562
Well, you know, drake,
technically jesus was born

262
00:11:59,628 --> 00:12:02,598
around april, so we need to get
rid of this winter foliage.

263
00:12:02,684 --> 00:12:06,271
Oh, and, finn,
the word manger actually refers

264
00:12:06,336 --> 00:12:08,509
to the wooden feeding trough
that the animals used,

265
00:12:08,556 --> 00:12:13,260
so let's put baby jesus
in this little shot glass.

266
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,861
Perfect.
Well, you know,

267
00:12:15,908 --> 00:12:17,439
based on how far they had
to travel,

268
00:12:17,514 --> 00:12:20,059
all the experts agree
that the wise men didn't really

269
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,209
get there until jesus was two,
so let's get rid of them.

270
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,462
Uh, uh, carlton.

271
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:25,711
Remember,
this is for the children.

272
00:12:26,085 --> 00:12:26,899
Right.

273
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:29,312
Let's do one
with santa in it.

274
00:12:29,865 --> 00:12:31,288
Hand me kris kringle
there, guys.

275
00:12:31,326 --> 00:12:32,913
That's a great idea!

276
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:36,617
You know, interestingly enough,
the dutch version of santa

277
00:12:36,917 --> 00:12:39,086
used slaves
to deliver the toys.

278
00:12:45,424 --> 00:12:47,865
We're here to give our official
statements for the Fuller case.

279
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,916
Yes. About that.

280
00:12:49,965 --> 00:12:55,676
Um, our investigation has
confirmed Mr. Spencer's hunches.

281
00:12:55,918 --> 00:12:57,373
Ah, really?

282
00:12:57,725 --> 00:13:00,678
- It was murder.
- That's 27 and counting.

283
00:13:00,772 --> 00:13:03,968
Do you folks mind coming on in
for a moment? Just have a seat.

284
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:05,600
Make yourselves comfortable.

285
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:07,891
Chair's right
over there.

286
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,196
I thought we could, uh,
have more privacy this way.

287
00:13:11,237 --> 00:13:12,457
Why? What, is there a problem?

288
00:13:12,534 --> 00:13:14,121
Well, this report says
that there were traces

289
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:16,562
of weed killer found
in Mr. Fuller's system.

290
00:13:16,628 --> 00:13:17,454
Poison.

291
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:19,116
I sensed that as well.

292
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,060
There's just
one slight problem,

293
00:13:21,107 --> 00:13:23,389
we found a box of the same type
of weed killer

294
00:13:23,534 --> 00:13:25,100
on Mr. Guster's property.

295
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:26,700
Can you explain that?

296
00:13:27,444 --> 00:13:30,293
Whoa, whoa, now. Slow your roll.
I can explain that.

297
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:33,024
Me and Fuller had a long-time
feud about the property line.

298
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,235
And every now and then
I'd poison his shrubs

299
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:37,460
because he refused
to cut them back.

300
00:13:38,386 --> 00:13:39,842
Bill, that's not like you.

301
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,182
How about this? Blunt force trauma
to the head of the deceased

302
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,429
was done caused by a bloody
hammer found nearby

303
00:13:44,495 --> 00:13:47,237
with prints belonging
to a Mr. William Guster.

304
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,091
Yeah, but if you'd looked
a little closer,

305
00:13:50,147 --> 00:13:52,954
you would have found a hacksaw and
a pickaxe with my prints on them too.

306
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,044
Fuller had been taking
my tools for years.

307
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:57,100
That's another reason
we'd been feuding.

308
00:13:57,297 --> 00:13:59,654
Another perfectly
reasonable explanation.

309
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:02,208
Just one more thing,
the rope

310
00:14:02,268 --> 00:14:03,925
to hang Mr. Fuller
matches rope

311
00:14:03,963 --> 00:14:07,691
- used from a boat belonging to...
- Lemme guess. Me.

312
00:14:10,011 --> 00:14:11,100
Dad, you're crazy.

313
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,500
Mr. G.

314
00:14:13,211 --> 00:14:14,400
Wait.

315
00:14:14,966 --> 00:14:16,412
You mean it really was mine?

316
00:14:16,496 --> 00:14:18,233
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

317
00:14:18,308 --> 00:14:20,158
Look, I just said that
to be funny.

318
00:14:20,942 --> 00:14:22,548
I have no idea how it got there.

319
00:14:22,604 --> 00:14:24,933
I am sorry, Mr. Guster,
the evidence is strong enough.

320
00:14:25,393 --> 00:14:28,168
- You have the right to remain silent.
- What?

321
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:29,549
You give up that right,
anything you say

322
00:14:29,646 --> 00:14:30,726
you can't arrest me!

323
00:14:30,794 --> 00:14:32,266
- And will be used against you in a court of law.
- I'm a deacon in a church!

324
00:14:32,313 --> 00:14:35,044
- You have a right to an attorney.
- What is the lord gonna say?

325
00:14:38,058 --> 00:14:40,105
It's very nice of you
to invite us over.

326
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,936
Oh, Winnie, it's
the least I could do.

327
00:14:41,983 --> 00:14:45,367
- Now when is bill gonna be released from custody?
- Soon I hope.

328
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:47,296
A thing like this
could be devastating to somebody

329
00:14:47,361 --> 00:14:50,356
with delicate health,
a weak disposition.

330
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:52,807
We're gonna get dad out before
anything can happen to him.

331
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,098
I was talking about you.

332
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:58,054
Your father's strong as an ox, but you,

333
00:14:58,251 --> 00:15:01,758
lord knows you have enough
stress to deal with as it is.

334
00:15:02,081 --> 00:15:06,790
Mrs. G., you have my word,
everything will be fine.

335
00:15:06,884 --> 00:15:08,597
- We're gonna take this case.
- Yeah.

336
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:11,681
Shawn, maybe we oughta get
some food together here.

337
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:17,220
- Maybe you oughta pass on this one.
- I can't, dad. I owe it to them.

338
00:15:17,277 --> 00:15:19,934
Look, the Gusters
are nice people, okay?

339
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,117
They invite you over for dinner at 6:00.
They don't serve till 6:30.

340
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,091
So what?

341
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:24,508
The point is, as a rule,

342
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:26,597
you never wanna get involved in a case

343
00:15:26,654 --> 00:15:29,109
where personal relationships are involved.

344
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,455
- Dad, I think I can handle it.
- What if Gus's dad is guilty?

345
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,425
Are you out of your mind?
How could you even say that?

346
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,505
That's what I mean. Right there, Shawn.

347
00:15:41,561 --> 00:15:44,213
You've already made
your decision irrespective of the facts.

348
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,955
You have already compromised this case.

349
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,522
Compromised? Why?

350
00:15:47,588 --> 00:15:49,597
Because I'm not afraid
of my own emotional attachment?

351
00:15:49,653 --> 00:15:52,775
I'll have you know that I view that as a tool
in my problem-solving, not a liability.

352
00:15:52,812 --> 00:15:54,427
It is that exact kind of lame-ass thinking...

353
00:15:54,483 --> 00:15:56,690
I can see why you were never a detective.

354
00:15:56,737 --> 00:15:58,774
And I can see why you ended up
a divorced detective.

355
00:16:03,815 --> 00:16:04,782
My god.

356
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,697
We went almost three hours
without having an argument.

357
00:16:08,852 --> 00:16:11,237
It's our best holiday in years, huh?

358
00:16:15,654 --> 00:16:18,151
Uh, I was just arresting someone
in the neighborhood.

359
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,935
I thought I'd drop by and say hi.

360
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:24,911
Oh, you know, we just sat down to lunch, so...

361
00:16:25,457 --> 00:16:26,436
Sorry.

362
00:16:26,502 --> 00:16:27,704
Hey, guys.

363
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,291
Look what I've got.

364
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,104
A wii!

365
00:16:32,178 --> 00:16:33,390
Awesome!

366
00:16:33,774 --> 00:16:37,673
Wow, that's actually
very thoughtful. Thank you.

367
00:16:37,757 --> 00:16:40,010
It turned up in a sweep.
I mean, they're welcome to use it,

368
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,674
but technically it belongs
to the D.A.'s office.

369
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:44,622
Come on! Let's play boxing!

370
00:16:44,745 --> 00:16:46,000
You're not busy?

371
00:16:46,154 --> 00:16:49,656
No, no. Go right ahead.

372
00:16:52,326 --> 00:16:55,267
Oh, oh, drake, you're too slow, my friend!

373
00:16:55,332 --> 00:16:57,599
You better change your name
to Lassiter because I own you!

374
00:16:58,737 --> 00:17:00,756
Oh, he's down on the ground!

375
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,393
- What a lame-o.
- Come on.

376
00:17:05,409 --> 00:17:08,029
Who's next? Who's next? Come on!

377
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:10,100
Let's go! Somebody come
get some! Who's next?

378
00:17:10,226 --> 00:17:11,700
Get some! Come on!

379
00:17:14,572 --> 00:17:18,422
You guys sure you don't wanna
take a sandwich or anything for the road?

380
00:17:18,478 --> 00:17:19,900
You hardly ate any of your food.

381
00:17:19,967 --> 00:17:22,708
Ooh, I remember once when we
were little you made us

382
00:17:22,774 --> 00:17:24,277
- these chicken cordon bleus.
- Shawn.

383
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:27,000
- But the ham was so thin...
- Shawn!

384
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:28,496
We don't have an appetite.

385
00:17:28,543 --> 00:17:30,200
All we can think
about is clearing dad's name

386
00:17:30,252 --> 00:17:31,700
and getting him out of jail.

387
00:17:32,711 --> 00:17:35,039
I'll give you a call
as soon as we have any leads.

388
00:17:38,502 --> 00:17:39,225
Dad.

389
00:17:40,202 --> 00:17:42,727
No, it is not an engraved set
of rubber bullets.

390
00:17:42,793 --> 00:17:45,502
Why would I possibly give you
another excuse to shoot a gun?

391
00:17:45,605 --> 00:17:46,900
Well, you better keep thinking.

392
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:51,032
Shawn, I don't have to tell you
how important this case is.

393
00:17:51,108 --> 00:17:53,408
So whatever you need, just let me know.

394
00:17:55,652 --> 00:17:58,300
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
What? What is it?

395
00:17:58,485 --> 00:17:59,978
Give me a second.

396
00:18:00,785 --> 00:18:02,540
Is it a clue that clears my dad?

397
00:18:02,587 --> 00:18:04,606
Can you shush for one second?

398
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:06,400
I know you think this is easy for me,

399
00:18:06,466 --> 00:18:09,875
but I do go through a mental
process. Like a equals b.

400
00:18:09,928 --> 00:18:10,839
B equals c.

401
00:18:10,895 --> 00:18:12,842
Which means a equals...
Would you stop it?

402
00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:15,687
That's too close!
Now I gotta start all over.

403
00:18:19,163 --> 00:18:20,806
Damn it, Shawn,
what's taking so long?

404
00:18:20,843 --> 00:18:22,500
Okay! All right!

405
00:18:22,576 --> 00:18:25,215
We need to figure out if there
was a homeowner's association.

406
00:18:30,164 --> 00:18:31,357
Ah, Mr. Mitchell.

407
00:18:31,394 --> 00:18:33,000
- Yes.
- My name is Shawn Spencer.

408
00:18:33,093 --> 00:18:35,807
I'm not interested
in any fake vacation packages.

409
00:18:35,873 --> 00:18:37,826
I'm not giving you
my social security number

410
00:18:37,863 --> 00:18:40,286
so I can claim the grand prize,
and I'm not paying

411
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:43,263
for any damn subscriptions
for magazines that I know I'll never see.

412
00:18:46,689 --> 00:18:50,308
I'm the head psychic for the
Santa Barbara police department.

413
00:18:53,851 --> 00:18:55,335
Well, come on in then.

414
00:19:00,711 --> 00:19:03,161
We're investigating
the death of Mr. Fuller.

415
00:19:03,387 --> 00:19:06,523
And I am sensing some unresolved conflict
between the two of you.

416
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:09,913
Something... something to do
with rules and violations.

417
00:19:09,966 --> 00:19:11,037
Yes, it's true.

418
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:13,168
Fuller became a constant thorn in my side

419
00:19:13,224 --> 00:19:15,487
ever since I started
the homeowner's association.

420
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:17,633
He refused to follow the ordinances.

421
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:21,708
When I'd give him citations, he'd tear
them up and throw them in the trash.

422
00:19:21,955 --> 00:19:23,729
So I'd give him another citation.

423
00:19:23,814 --> 00:19:26,152
It was a constant, vicious cycle.

424
00:19:26,314 --> 00:19:27,600
It's him.

425
00:19:27,854 --> 00:19:29,219
He did it. Bust him, Shawn.

426
00:19:29,262 --> 00:19:30,520
See it, see it.

427
00:19:30,589 --> 00:19:32,664
See it. Stop it.

428
00:19:34,645 --> 00:19:36,523
Sounds like you wanted him out of the way.

429
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,204
No, no, not at all.

430
00:19:38,269 --> 00:19:40,946
He was a pain, but he was
our best supporter.

431
00:19:41,278 --> 00:19:42,114
Our?

432
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,785
The Mitchell family.

433
00:19:44,015 --> 00:19:46,766
We founded this neighborhood
100 years ago.

434
00:19:46,823 --> 00:19:51,424
Now we're lobbying the city to have
them declare it a historical district.

435
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,169
Fuller refused to sell his
house after all these years.

436
00:19:55,245 --> 00:19:56,803
We were the only friends he had.

437
00:19:57,681 --> 00:19:58,526
Hello.

438
00:19:58,585 --> 00:20:01,956
Oh, hi, honey. This is Shawn Spencer
and Burton Guster.

439
00:20:02,154 --> 00:20:07,056
I remember the two of you from when
you were no more than yea high.

440
00:20:08,643 --> 00:20:13,208
You had the cutest
little lawn-mowing business.

441
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,547
Oh, wow, that's right. We did.

442
00:20:15,622 --> 00:20:20,392
In fact I think we paid you $5.00
for a job that never got done.

443
00:20:20,463 --> 00:20:23,383
Oh! This guy.

444
00:20:23,449 --> 00:20:26,557
You know, the yard tools
are out back. I'll go get them.

445
00:20:28,676 --> 00:20:30,563
She's, uh...
She's not serious, is she?

446
00:20:30,652 --> 00:20:31,760
She is.

447
00:20:37,835 --> 00:20:40,220
Oh, and make sure
to water the gardenias.

448
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,793
I've had them longer
than you've been alive.

449
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,937
This is ridiculous.

450
00:20:54,022 --> 00:20:56,435
She should've just accepted
the $5.00 refund offer.

451
00:20:56,502 --> 00:20:58,774
We need to be solving my dad's case.

452
00:21:01,966 --> 00:21:02,952
Dude.

453
00:21:06,762 --> 00:21:09,200
There's somebody
in old man Fuller's house.

454
00:21:12,377 --> 00:21:14,632
I can't believe we're gonna bail
on the mitchells' yard again.

455
00:21:14,699 --> 00:21:15,929
Come on!

456
00:21:23,971 --> 00:21:25,980
Who are you, and what are you doing here?

457
00:21:26,027 --> 00:21:27,989
I should ask you the same thing.

458
00:21:31,661 --> 00:21:32,872
My name's Shawn.

459
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:35,765
This is my partner,
skooney "u-turn" singleton.

460
00:21:35,846 --> 00:21:38,071
We're from dirty boy landscaping.

461
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,204
I got a call from your office,
said you needed some estimates

462
00:21:40,242 --> 00:21:41,998
on some renovations.

463
00:21:42,608 --> 00:21:43,969
You guys are fast.

464
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:47,146
I just left word at the office
saying I needed a landscape architect.

465
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,409
You know, I cold-called
this geezer for years

466
00:21:49,483 --> 00:21:52,412
pushing him to sell,
and he always refused.

467
00:21:52,497 --> 00:21:54,221
Finally it's available.

468
00:21:54,286 --> 00:21:55,338
Really?

469
00:21:55,404 --> 00:21:57,114
What's so special about this place?

470
00:21:57,161 --> 00:21:59,114
It's the only lot in the neighborhood

471
00:21:59,728 --> 00:22:02,063
with 360-degree unobstructed views.

472
00:22:02,626 --> 00:22:04,285
It'll sell for a fortune.

473
00:22:07,144 --> 00:22:09,517
Don't worry, this yard will
be immaculate when we're done.

474
00:22:09,575 --> 00:22:11,099
- Bye-bye.
- Be in touch.

475
00:22:11,252 --> 00:22:12,711
You hear her, Shawn?

476
00:22:12,726 --> 00:22:14,260
She's been cold-calling for years.

477
00:22:14,275 --> 00:22:16,182
And she stands to make a fortune on this place.

478
00:22:16,197 --> 00:22:17,386
That's motive. Right?

479
00:22:17,401 --> 00:22:18,537
Yeah, yeah.

480
00:22:18,852 --> 00:22:20,925
It's gotta be her.
What more do we need?

481
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,540
Let's get the cops on it right away.

482
00:22:23,613 --> 00:22:25,413
I, I guess it wouldn't, uh, hurt

483
00:22:25,432 --> 00:22:27,657
to have them
do a cursory background check.

484
00:22:27,688 --> 00:22:30,864
Maybe, maybe look.
Look at the phone records.

485
00:22:30,879 --> 00:22:31,952
- Right.
- Okay.

486
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:40,204
I'll do everything in my power
to make this process

487
00:22:40,242 --> 00:22:41,794
as painless as possible.

488
00:22:41,982 --> 00:22:43,622
Jules. Jules, over here!

489
00:22:47,047 --> 00:22:48,263
It's about time.

490
00:22:48,496 --> 00:22:49,944
Did you check the phone records?

491
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:51,344
Yep, your tip paid off.

492
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,716
That's great. Thank goodness.

493
00:22:52,731 --> 00:22:54,766
There were all these vibes,
but I wasn't sure.

494
00:22:54,781 --> 00:22:56,099
So it was rosa.

495
00:22:56,114 --> 00:22:57,823
- Who?
- The real estate agent.

496
00:22:58,874 --> 00:23:00,359
No,
no.

497
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,269
She has a solid alibi.

498
00:23:02,746 --> 00:23:05,833
But we discovered quite a few calls
from someone else,

499
00:23:05,848 --> 00:23:08,730
who also made numerous cash transfers
into Fuller's account.

500
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:10,639
Possibly paying off a blackmail.

501
00:23:10,654 --> 00:23:12,763
Wait a second,
if you're not about to arrest rosa,

502
00:23:12,802 --> 00:23:14,249
what are you doing standing here?

503
00:23:14,901 --> 00:23:15,982
Distracting you.

504
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:17,265
Distracting.

505
00:23:19,111 --> 00:23:20,294
Sorry, Gus.

506
00:23:21,314 --> 00:23:22,314
Shawn!

507
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:23,801
Shawn!

508
00:23:24,253 --> 00:23:27,100
- No, no, no, Mr. Guster!
- Mr. Guster.

509
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:29,483
Burton, Burton, please.
Don't make a scene, darling.

510
00:23:29,498 --> 00:23:31,750
The neighbors, neighbors
are watching us.

511
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:33,264
What is this?

512
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:35,365
Get in the car, ma'am.
Please.

513
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:39,089
- Watch your head.
- Don't!

514
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,986
Don't you touch my hair!

515
00:23:51,035 --> 00:23:52,675
We got here as fast as we could.

516
00:23:52,822 --> 00:23:54,194
This is our worst nightmare.

517
00:23:54,459 --> 00:23:57,138
It seems like everything
is conspiring against us.

518
00:23:57,473 --> 00:23:58,727
So we lawyered up.

519
00:23:58,814 --> 00:24:00,550
That's how they say
it in the bucket, son,

520
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:02,277
Where I did an eight-hour bid.

521
00:24:02,503 --> 00:24:04,239
I don't know those words.

522
00:24:05,687 --> 00:24:08,755
I'm not gonna do well in prison.

523
00:24:09,327 --> 00:24:11,391
Don't worry, sweetheart.

524
00:24:11,473 --> 00:24:12,915
You'll be fine.

525
00:24:13,301 --> 00:24:14,825
She not gonna make it.

526
00:24:15,285 --> 00:24:17,609
I told you,
nobody's going to prison.

527
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,960
Mrs. G,

528
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:21,216
why didn't you tell anybody

529
00:24:21,231 --> 00:24:24,000
that old man Fuller was blackmailing
you for all these years?

530
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:26,635
I wanted to, believe me,
I did, but I couldn't.

531
00:24:26,997 --> 00:24:30,180
You see, this all started when bill's
sailboat caught fire.

532
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:33,712
I tried to muster up the courage
to tell everybody that it was my fault.

533
00:24:33,886 --> 00:24:37,188
But before I could, the insurance
company had paid everything off already.

534
00:24:37,688 --> 00:24:40,449
Well, somehow, Fuller knew the truth
of what had happened.

535
00:24:40,642 --> 00:24:42,985
He threatened to turn me
in for insurance fraud

536
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,725
if I didn't pay him every month.

537
00:24:44,982 --> 00:24:47,136
Well, he was so old,
I figured paying him off

538
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:50,102
for the rest of his life
was the cheapest route.

539
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,824
To the police it looks like motive.

540
00:24:52,036 --> 00:24:53,039
I know.

541
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,652
But don't worry, son.

542
00:24:55,899 --> 00:24:57,114
We have called nana.

543
00:24:57,221 --> 00:24:59,553
She's to look after you
in case anything should happen

544
00:24:59,568 --> 00:25:00,822
to the two of us.

545
00:25:00,837 --> 00:25:01,876
Mom,

546
00:25:02,236 --> 00:25:05,211
I don't need my grandmother, who lives
in a nursing home to look after me.

547
00:25:05,691 --> 00:25:06,694
We hear you, son.

548
00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:08,479
We hear you.
Anyway, it's just

549
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,529
until we can raise the money
to post your mother's

550
00:25:10,544 --> 00:25:12,038
bail and pay our legal bills.

551
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:14,033
Whatever the cost is, I'll cover it.

552
00:25:14,098 --> 00:25:16,554
- Don't worry about it.
- We appreciate the gesture, Burton.

553
00:25:16,908 --> 00:25:19,648
But, son,
we're talking real money.

554
00:25:20,078 --> 00:25:22,280
You have a savings account
in a Penny Jar.

555
00:25:22,546 --> 00:25:25,605
I have a 401,
a diversified asset-allocated

556
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,543
portfolio full of securities
and equity to tap into.

557
00:25:28,905 --> 00:25:31,792
He's always been so good
with the big words.

558
00:25:32,756 --> 00:25:34,912
How much do you think we can get
for the cutlass?

559
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,336
Stop it!
I can't take anymore!

560
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:39,963
All of my life
it's been Gus can't handle this!

561
00:25:39,978 --> 00:25:41,329
Protect Gus from that!

562
00:25:41,656 --> 00:25:42,718
Well, guess what?

563
00:25:42,771 --> 00:25:45,220
I'm the most responsible, well-prepared,

564
00:25:45,258 --> 00:25:47,745
non-criminal-record-having adult
in this room.

565
00:25:47,987 --> 00:25:50,372
And it's high time
you two stopped babying me.

566
00:25:50,387 --> 00:25:51,999
I'm 29-years-old.

567
00:25:52,014 --> 00:25:55,282
And by the way, I know you've
only been married for 28 years.

568
00:25:55,297 --> 00:25:57,449
I did the math a long time ago.

569
00:25:57,464 --> 00:25:59,094
So stop protecting me from that.

570
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:00,736
Starting now,

571
00:26:01,138 --> 00:26:02,470
I'm gonna take care of you.

572
00:26:02,807 --> 00:26:04,389
I'm gonna give you money.

573
00:26:04,924 --> 00:26:06,461
And we're gonna solve this case.

574
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:09,474
Shawn may not have always been
the best influence on me,

575
00:26:09,713 --> 00:26:12,684
but he's always believed in me,
even when I didn't believe in myself.

576
00:26:12,942 --> 00:26:13,961
And right now,

577
00:26:14,421 --> 00:26:15,443
I believe in him.

578
00:26:18,521 --> 00:26:19,621
We hear ya, son.

579
00:26:27,973 --> 00:26:29,327
All right, dude.

580
00:26:29,342 --> 00:26:31,163
You had your moment, man.
You nailed it.

581
00:26:31,638 --> 00:26:33,201
Now go ahead and make a timely exit.

582
00:26:33,787 --> 00:26:34,789
Come on, man.

583
00:26:35,174 --> 00:26:36,756
Before you gotta make another speech.

584
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:40,026
Your mom being arrested might be

585
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:41,824
Christmas miracle we need for the case.

586
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:42,856
How so?

587
00:26:44,329 --> 00:26:45,969
I suspect she wasn't the only one

588
00:26:45,984 --> 00:26:48,438
in the neighborhood that old man
Fuller was blackmailing.

589
00:26:48,551 --> 00:26:50,172
We gotta get back in his house.

590
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:17,794
Let's hurry up.

591
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,717
This place gives me the creeps.

592
00:27:34,231 --> 00:27:35,234
Bingo!

593
00:27:35,423 --> 00:27:38,286
This must be how old man Fuller
saw your mom burn your dad's boat.

594
00:27:45,175 --> 00:27:46,680
Dude, there's something in there.

595
00:27:46,842 --> 00:27:48,058
What do you think it is?

596
00:27:58,445 --> 00:27:59,661
Will you stop it, Shawn?

597
00:27:59,687 --> 00:28:01,501
You know how that story
gives me the creeps.

598
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:07,823
Norman!
Norman!

599
00:28:07,871 --> 00:28:09,087
Norman!

600
00:28:09,102 --> 00:28:10,902
Okay, stop it, that's enough!
That's enough!

601
00:28:11,212 --> 00:28:12,669
- Game over.
- Fine.

602
00:28:17,616 --> 00:28:18,637
Don't play, Shawn.

603
00:28:41,829 --> 00:28:43,062
Just as I thought.

604
00:28:43,826 --> 00:28:46,823
He was snooping on the entire
neighborhood from up here.

605
00:28:47,215 --> 00:28:48,874
These are his blackmail pictures.

606
00:28:53,463 --> 00:28:54,805
Suburban pot farm.

607
00:28:57,178 --> 00:28:58,604
Bootleg dvd ring.

608
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:02,572
None of these are really cause
for murder.

609
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:10,430
Covering an illicit affair.

610
00:29:11,033 --> 00:29:12,841
Now that's what I call motive.

611
00:29:20,076 --> 00:29:21,080
What?

612
00:29:32,372 --> 00:29:33,372
You see anything?

613
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:40,531
Hurry up.

614
00:29:48,436 --> 00:29:50,500
<i>I know where our culprit lives.</i>

615
00:29:58,173 --> 00:30:01,602
Hey. Got some questions for you about
some illicit pictures.

616
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:12,583
But we already know where you live!

617
00:30:43,632 --> 00:30:46,759
We call that "sammy floyd's
tree house ambush."

618
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:50,432
Okay, okay.

619
00:30:50,466 --> 00:30:51,527
Okay.
You got me.

620
00:30:51,552 --> 00:30:53,134
I'll give you your pictures back.

621
00:30:54,189 --> 00:30:56,502
We have pictures of you, Dude.

622
00:30:56,612 --> 00:30:58,835
The ones old man Fuller
was blackmailing you for.

623
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:01,626
- What pictures are you talking about?
- I work at a one-hour photo.

624
00:31:01,807 --> 00:31:03,905
I thought you were asking
about the pictures of hot,

625
00:31:03,982 --> 00:31:05,401
naked chicks I sometimes keep.

626
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:06,568
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

627
00:31:08,641 --> 00:31:09,857
This isn't you?

628
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:11,552
No.

629
00:31:12,236 --> 00:31:13,644
But it kinda looks like my dad.

630
00:31:13,734 --> 00:31:16,140
From about 30 years ago
when we first moved here.

631
00:31:16,596 --> 00:31:18,834
Man, it was an old picture
mixed in with the new ones.

632
00:31:18,887 --> 00:31:21,279
We couldn't tell the difference
because they're all black and white.

633
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,749
So we're looking for his dad?

634
00:31:22,788 --> 00:31:24,500
- Yes.
- He passed away a few years ago.

635
00:31:24,534 --> 00:31:25,537
No.

636
00:31:25,886 --> 00:31:27,247
Who's this woman in the photo?

637
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:28,801
It's not my mom.
That's for sure.

638
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:31,059
- She died before we moved here.
- Who the hell is she?

639
00:31:31,329 --> 00:31:33,820
You know, don't really feel comfortable
talking about my family secrets, all right?

640
00:31:33,835 --> 00:31:36,665
What's the name of that one-hour photo
where you hide your filthy debauchery?

641
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,428
I remember my dad had a female friend
who would visit only at night.

642
00:31:39,777 --> 00:31:41,474
- What was her name?
- I don't remember.

643
00:31:41,489 --> 00:31:43,045
- Do you know she lives?
- No.

644
00:31:43,103 --> 00:31:45,283
Can you tell us anything?
I just swung from a tree.

645
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:49,079
When she left the house would
smell like, white linenperfume.

646
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:50,976
I remember it because
it was the same perfume

647
00:31:50,991 --> 00:31:52,714
my mom used
to wear when she was alive.

648
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,257
- So our culprit is a woman?
- Apparently.

649
00:31:55,328 --> 00:31:57,131
Who looked like that 30 years ago.

650
00:31:57,631 --> 00:31:58,635
She's hot.

651
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:00,338
What?

652
00:32:00,727 --> 00:32:01,883
You have problems.

653
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:11,081
You know,
I was thinking.

654
00:32:11,126 --> 00:32:14,139
If, you guys have an extra seat
at that table

655
00:32:14,154 --> 00:32:17,009
for christmas dinner,
I might be available.

656
00:32:17,942 --> 00:32:20,547
Carlton, I haven't been completely
honest with you.

657
00:32:20,707 --> 00:32:22,733
- You see, family.
- Say no more.

658
00:32:24,513 --> 00:32:25,516
Don't worry.

659
00:32:26,101 --> 00:32:27,724
I won't come around anymore.

660
00:32:28,008 --> 00:32:29,649
I am so sorry, Carlton.

661
00:32:29,664 --> 00:32:32,700
Don't be. I mean it's. It's totally
natural for you to be jealous

662
00:32:32,715 --> 00:32:34,401
if your nephews like me more than you.

663
00:32:35,025 --> 00:32:36,701
- Come again?
- I get it.

664
00:32:36,716 --> 00:32:39,921
You're used to being the cool aunt
that everyone wants to hang out with.

665
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,192
But when I'm around,
you just can't compete with that.

666
00:32:42,207 --> 00:32:45,172
Sometimes I just.
I forget to dial down

667
00:32:45,187 --> 00:32:46,917
my coolness when I'm around kids.

668
00:32:48,015 --> 00:32:49,578
They're just so impressionable.

669
00:32:51,702 --> 00:32:52,705
You

670
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:54,847
are so right.

671
00:32:56,115 --> 00:32:57,648
I can't compete with that.

672
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,430
Hey,
don't be so hard on yourself.

673
00:33:00,483 --> 00:33:02,731
All right, I'm sure your nephews
still think you're

674
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:04,439
really fly.

675
00:33:06,965 --> 00:33:08,414
Merry christmas, Carlton.

676
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,078
Great news.

677
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:16,729
We're following a new lead on the case.

678
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:19,272
That's great because I just got
my notice to appear in court

679
00:33:19,287 --> 00:33:21,075
just in time for christmas.

680
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:22,251
Look at this.

681
00:33:22,449 --> 00:33:24,715
An announcement for old man
Fuller's estate sale.

682
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,419
Making people buy back stuff that was

683
00:33:26,434 --> 00:33:28,441
probably
already theirs in the first place.

684
00:33:29,772 --> 00:33:31,489
I don't know what they put
in this stuff,

685
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:35,197
But the jerk chicken from Kingstons
has always been the best.

686
00:33:35,507 --> 00:33:36,549
Let me see.

687
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:42,445
Well, they got the right ratio
of black pepper, scotch bonnet,

688
00:33:43,282 --> 00:33:44,285
and thyme.

689
00:33:44,343 --> 00:33:45,343
Hey, son.

690
00:33:48,203 --> 00:33:49,733
Whoo. I ain't mad at that.

691
00:33:49,912 --> 00:33:52,277
But they should have used
a quarter less pimento.

692
00:33:53,144 --> 00:33:54,147
Mom.

693
00:33:55,979 --> 00:33:57,754
Minced nutmeg instead of ground.

694
00:33:58,601 --> 00:33:59,604
My god.

695
00:33:59,823 --> 00:34:02,235
Gus, you came
by the super smeller honest.

696
00:34:07,301 --> 00:34:10,002
She also smelled like,
white linenperfume.

697
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:12,051
Dude!

698
00:34:12,122 --> 00:34:14,183
Can the super smeller
pick out a scent from memory?

699
00:34:14,248 --> 00:34:15,800
Well, the olfactory and memory areas

700
00:34:15,815 --> 00:34:18,513
of the cerebral cortex
share the same neural pathways.

701
00:34:18,627 --> 00:34:20,335
- What is that? Is that a yes?
- Yes.

702
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,595
Sweet!
I think I know how to solve the case!

703
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:23,650
Come on!

704
00:34:24,232 --> 00:34:25,408
We'll be back.

705
00:34:29,279 --> 00:34:32,256
Jules, I'm getting a major
psychic disturbance

706
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:35,352
down at old man Fuller's estate sale.
You might wanna get down here.

707
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:37,249
Okay.
Hurry.

708
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:39,419
Check it out.

709
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:42,587
If our culprit's here, she's gonna wanna
get a hold of those photos.

710
00:34:42,602 --> 00:34:44,384
- Right.
- If she's like most old ladies,

711
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,274
she probably thinks you were on
the Jeffersons,

712
00:34:46,289 --> 00:34:48,770
and she wears the same perfume
from her youth.

713
00:34:48,823 --> 00:34:51,174
All you gotta do is identify
who's wearingwhite linen.

714
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:53,087
- I'll take care of the rest.
- Got it.

715
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:57,789
- You ready?
- Yep.

716
00:34:58,919 --> 00:35:01,033
Ladies and Gentlemen,
the next item up for bidding

717
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,041
- Is this one-of-a-kind.
- Excuse me.

718
00:35:03,056 --> 00:35:05,925
Antiqued confederate
civil war battle flag.

719
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,733
Who will open the bidding at $100?

720
00:35:09,011 --> 00:35:10,264
May I have $100?

721
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,015
Thank you.
I have $100 to open the bidding.

722
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:17,121
How about $200? Can I hear $200?
$200. Thank you.

723
00:35:17,136 --> 00:35:20,123
$200. Xan I hear $300?
$300?

724
00:35:20,138 --> 00:35:21,868
Anyone.
Thank you, sir, $300.

725
00:35:21,926 --> 00:35:23,972
Do I hear $400?
Who will say $400?

726
00:35:23,987 --> 00:35:26,405
Do I hear $400? Who will go $400?
Thank you.

727
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,060
I have $400.
Do I have $500?

728
00:35:29,426 --> 00:35:30,439
$500?

729
00:35:31,015 --> 00:35:33,116
$500, who will.
Thank you.

730
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,890
I have $500.

731
00:35:34,905 --> 00:35:36,164
Come on.
Any luck?

732
00:35:36,179 --> 00:35:38,377
No old lady in here
is wearingwhite linen.

733
00:35:38,392 --> 00:35:40,532
- Sweet. That's our only lead.
- Sold!

734
00:35:40,547 --> 00:35:44,141
To the man in the blue argyle sweater
for $500.

735
00:35:44,257 --> 00:35:46,606
This antique confederate battle flag.

736
00:35:48,308 --> 00:35:49,755
Thank you for bidding, sir.

737
00:35:49,801 --> 00:35:51,150
Enjoy your flag.

738
00:35:51,611 --> 00:35:52,807
Here you go.

739
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,814
You can totally get a gun rack
for your truck now.

740
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:58,286
Next item up for bidding is this box
of heirlooms.

741
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:00,189
Antique photographs.

742
00:36:00,204 --> 00:36:01,698
Dude, I don't know what to do.

743
00:36:01,713 --> 00:36:03,400
$100 to open.
You better do something.

744
00:36:03,439 --> 00:36:05,249
- I supposed to smell everyone?
- Thank you.

745
00:36:05,301 --> 00:36:06,551
I have $100.

746
00:36:06,566 --> 00:36:07,875
Who will go $200?

747
00:36:08,855 --> 00:36:10,958
Make sure to water the gardenias.

748
00:36:10,976 --> 00:36:13,504
I've had them longer
than you've been alive.

749
00:36:15,881 --> 00:36:17,830
Identify the base
component of that fragrance.

750
00:36:20,851 --> 00:36:21,897
Gardenia.

751
00:36:21,912 --> 00:36:23,339
Are you absolutely certain?

752
00:36:23,354 --> 00:36:24,715
Tahitian gardenia.

753
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:26,858
- Thank you. Now give me a push.
- What?

754
00:36:26,873 --> 00:36:29,601
- Give me a little push.
- Not pushing you just give me a little.

755
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,415
Get that ball off my grass, Guster!

756
00:36:37,951 --> 00:36:39,647
Get out of my yard!

757
00:36:40,133 --> 00:36:42,650
If you kids don't keep
it quiet out there,

758
00:36:42,665 --> 00:36:45,713
I'm gonna call the cops!

759
00:36:46,776 --> 00:36:49,567
He's channeling old man Fuller's
grumpy drunken spirit.

760
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,797
What's that?

761
00:36:50,813 --> 00:36:52,990
What's that, you miserable old geezer?

762
00:36:53,551 --> 00:36:55,288
The cops have the wrong suspects.

763
00:36:55,544 --> 00:36:57,840
Well, then who's the killer?

764
00:36:59,787 --> 00:37:01,021
Gladys Mitchell?

765
00:37:05,069 --> 00:37:06,413
30 years ago you.

766
00:37:06,712 --> 00:37:08,542
You used to deliver flowers

767
00:37:08,588 --> 00:37:11,091
To the nice little widower
who moved in down the street.

768
00:37:11,106 --> 00:37:12,323
One thing led to another.

769
00:37:12,338 --> 00:37:14,641
The next thing you knew, you were locked

770
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:16,639
in a torrid, illicit affair.

771
00:37:17,203 --> 00:37:19,719
Dirty, sweaty, an affair that if it got

772
00:37:19,734 --> 00:37:21,650
to the public would not only ruin
your marriage,

773
00:37:21,665 --> 00:37:24,491
But soil the good name of the
neighborhood's founding family.

774
00:37:24,506 --> 00:37:27,022
Old man Fuller knew your secret!

775
00:37:27,086 --> 00:37:29,633
He could see everything
from his snooping perch.

776
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,885
In exchange for his silence,
you had to cater

777
00:37:34,015 --> 00:37:36,435
to all of his needs
for the better part of 30 years.

778
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:39,780
But oh, that bastard
just wouldn't die, would he?

779
00:37:39,795 --> 00:37:42,524
No, it was as if his meanness
was keeping him alive.

780
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:45,395
And then your worst nightmare
became a reality.

781
00:37:45,459 --> 00:37:47,408
He started going senile.

782
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,449
You couldn't risk him telling somebody
about the affair,

783
00:37:51,524 --> 00:37:53,519
So you took matters into your own hands,

784
00:37:53,534 --> 00:37:55,815
And you killed the son of a bitch!

785
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:57,413
That's absurd.

786
00:37:57,723 --> 00:38:00,945
I couldn't possibly hang
a grown man from up there.

787
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:04,487
I can see it.

788
00:38:05,972 --> 00:38:07,515
You tried to poison him!

789
00:38:09,792 --> 00:38:11,124
But he spit it out.

790
00:38:12,862 --> 00:38:14,936
Then you panicked.
You grabbed a hammer.

791
00:38:16,817 --> 00:38:18,334
You tried to bash in his skull!

792
00:38:18,349 --> 00:38:19,879
But no, he just wouldn't die!

793
00:38:19,894 --> 00:38:22,052
His little feet
twitching this way and that!

794
00:38:22,072 --> 00:38:23,833
And then a really desperate move.

795
00:38:23,872 --> 00:38:25,628
You grabbed the disoriented Fuller!

796
00:38:25,731 --> 00:38:27,727
You pushed him over
to the base of the stairs.

797
00:38:27,742 --> 00:38:29,793
You found yourself a nice piece of rope.

798
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,622
You tied one end around his Neck!

799
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,680
You draped the otherend
over the bannister

800
00:38:33,757 --> 00:38:35,360
and you tied it to the Chair lift.

801
00:38:36,749 --> 00:38:39,257
And then you used that Chair lift

802
00:38:41,167 --> 00:38:43,617
to pull old man Fuller

803
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:46,779
all the way up and over the bannister

804
00:38:46,794 --> 00:38:50,086
at this ridiculous, agonizing pace.

805
00:38:50,499 --> 00:38:51,765
And that

806
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,412
is how you killed that

807
00:38:55,206 --> 00:38:57,248
ancient,
pruney relic.

808
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:01,896
I'm so sorry, Honey.

809
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,948
I just couldn't let him ruin everything

810
00:39:04,963 --> 00:39:07,020
that we worked so hard to build.

811
00:39:07,657 --> 00:39:10,448
Guster, you can tell your parents
we're gonna drop the charges.

812
00:39:11,867 --> 00:39:13,078
Good work, Shawn.

813
00:39:17,071 --> 00:39:18,523
You've already had your moment.

814
00:39:24,955 --> 00:39:26,730
All right, let's light this puppy up.

815
00:39:31,589 --> 00:39:33,866
Well, Shawn,
it looks like another draw this year?

816
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,036
Yes.

817
00:39:35,051 --> 00:39:36,255
It appears so.

818
00:39:40,933 --> 00:39:44,077
<i>Look at that.
Little Psych golf balls.</i>

819
00:39:44,157 --> 00:39:46,367
I also signed you up for lessons
with the golf pro

820
00:39:46,382 --> 00:39:48,384
down at the Santa Barbara
municipal course.

821
00:39:48,399 --> 00:39:49,845
That's sweet, dad.
Thank you.

822
00:39:49,903 --> 00:39:51,061
All right, your turn.

823
00:39:51,121 --> 00:39:52,124
All right.

824
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,211
I have no idea what this is.

825
00:39:58,661 --> 00:39:59,857
What do we got here?

826
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,849
"Dear dad, you got me

827
00:40:01,884 --> 00:40:03,664
<i>monogrammed psych golf balls</i>

828
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:06,716
and golf lessons with the pro down
at the municipal course."

829
00:40:06,731 --> 00:40:08,039
Turn it, turn it, turn it.

830
00:40:08,863 --> 00:40:10,319
I believe his name is Pierre.

831
00:40:11,144 --> 00:40:12,720
I got you, old man!

832
00:40:12,831 --> 00:40:14,362
That's it, Shawn, you know,
this is the last year

833
00:40:14,377 --> 00:40:16,083
we're gonna play
this stupid little game.

834
00:40:16,098 --> 00:40:17,464
Somebody doesn't like to lose.

835
00:40:17,479 --> 00:40:20,057
Because you're an old grinch
during christmastime.

836
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:22,668
- The name is Ebenezer Grinch man.
- Stop. Stop!

837
00:40:22,683 --> 00:40:24,388
Grinch of the Cruise Scrooge grinchies.

838
00:40:24,403 --> 00:40:25,413
Shawn.

839
00:40:25,683 --> 00:40:27,197
Here you go. Here's your real gift.

840
00:40:27,744 --> 00:40:28,747
What?

841
00:40:28,824 --> 00:40:31,715
- Wait, what's it gonna do?
- Just give her a rip.

842
00:40:32,044 --> 00:40:33,578
So what's there? What's in there?

843
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,173
Look at that.

844
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,072
That's me fishing.

845
00:40:38,785 --> 00:40:40,656
In the snow. It's snowing.

846
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,557
That's really nice, Shawn.
That's great. Thank you.

847
00:40:43,685 --> 00:40:45,467
Thank you. All right.

848
00:40:45,736 --> 00:40:46,793
Thank you.

849
00:40:46,808 --> 00:40:49,224
Thank you for a lovely dinner.
I think we should be going now.

850
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:50,296
Yes. Thank you.

851
00:40:50,311 --> 00:40:51,877
It was my pleasure. Merry christmas.

852
00:40:51,897 --> 00:40:52,950
Merry christmas.

853
00:40:52,965 --> 00:40:54,705
I got a perfect place for this.

854
00:40:54,724 --> 00:40:56,083
You all should get some rest.

855
00:40:56,098 --> 00:40:57,354
You've been through a lot.

856
00:40:57,369 --> 00:41:00,047
Finally things can get back
to the way they were.

857
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:01,416
Well, almost.

858
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,663
I've been thinking,
maybe we could use some advice

859
00:41:04,678 --> 00:41:06,677
about that diversification stuff.

860
00:41:06,696 --> 00:41:08,673
Seem like you're doing
pretty good for yourself.

861
00:41:08,688 --> 00:41:11,298
And making some good business decisions.

862
00:41:13,155 --> 00:41:14,158
Sure!

863
00:41:14,225 --> 00:41:16,096
No problem.
Let me go get the car.

864
00:41:16,249 --> 00:41:17,252
Mr. Spencer.

865
00:41:17,895 --> 00:41:18,918
Shawn.

866
00:41:21,738 --> 00:41:24,516
Now, you look after Burton for us.

867
00:41:28,582 --> 00:41:29,944
Are you sure this is enough?

868
00:41:29,959 --> 00:41:31,935
I mean, this is Gus
we're talking about, right?

869
00:41:34,924 --> 00:41:36,610
Don't worry, Mr. G, I got it covered.

870
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:39,201
Merry christmas, Shawn.
Merry christmas to you all.

871
00:41:39,467 --> 00:41:40,468
Bye, Guys!

872
00:41:42,864 --> 00:41:45,009
All right, all right, all right.
How did you do it?

873
00:41:45,132 --> 00:41:48,559
Come on.
Don't. Don't.

874
00:41:48,817 --> 00:41:49,820
Don't...
