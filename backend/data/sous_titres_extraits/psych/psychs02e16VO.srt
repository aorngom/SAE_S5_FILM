1
00:00:14,486 --> 00:00:16,304
Hon, I'm gonna grab a drink.

2
00:00:16,424 --> 00:00:19,659
- Wanna get me one too, sweetie?
- Okay.

3
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:45,215
Shawn.

4
00:00:46,242 --> 00:00:47,587
What are you doing?

5
00:00:48,138 --> 00:00:50,364
You were supposed to be asleep
two hours ago.

6
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:51,811
I was watching.

7
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:53,840
And then I know I shouldn't, but then...

8
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:55,814
I didn't want to go back upstairs.

9
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,033
I was scared.

10
00:00:59,382 --> 00:01:00,443
All right.

11
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:06,455
Now listen,
now you know that none of this

12
00:01:06,718 --> 00:01:10,641
People do not become
bloodthirsty monsters after they get shot.

13
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,157
In fact, I've had a lot
of experience in the field

14
00:01:13,215 --> 00:01:16,279
with puncture wounds, and there's no way
a giant dart to the lungs creates

15
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:18,812
a 6-inch hole visible from the other side.

16
00:01:19,034 --> 00:01:20,812
- Really?
- No way!

17
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,564
I mean, maybe the blood-engorged cavity
will become purple and expand

18
00:01:24,723 --> 00:01:27,790
and perhaps even explode...
I've seen that.

19
00:01:32,513 --> 00:01:36,570
Look, dead bodies
do not walk, son.

20
00:01:37,688 --> 00:01:41,373
Sometimes they suddenly blink
or jolt for a second, but...

21
00:01:42,624 --> 00:01:45,609
Mostly they just wither and smell...

22
00:01:45,993 --> 00:01:47,696
And drizzle and ooze.

23
00:01:53,982 --> 00:01:55,484
All right, now go to bed.

24
00:01:55,604 --> 00:01:57,049
Sleep tight.

25
00:02:04,401 --> 00:02:05,554
A Museum?

26
00:02:05,747 --> 00:02:08,292
4:00 in the morning for a Museum
and not even the one downtown?

27
00:02:08,412 --> 00:02:10,474
- Hey, the paper come out yet?
- I don't know. They running another

28
00:02:10,534 --> 00:02:14,110
- story on the Wyles death?
- I don't know. Perhaps.

29
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,979
Gosh, I hadn't even thought about that.

30
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:19,379
Carlton, you're name's been in every article
they've printed since you've reopened the case.

31
00:02:19,499 --> 00:02:22,228
Has it? I try not to read
the papers too much... Very skewed.

32
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,450
No, I was just gonna look at the classified
ads. I mean, you know I've been looking

33
00:02:24,483 --> 00:02:26,847
- for a new bob's big boy, right?
- I got it, Detective.

34
00:02:26,967 --> 00:02:29,673
Press operator from the mirror
gave me an advanced copy.

35
00:02:29,793 --> 00:02:31,655
But there's nothing about
you or Wyles in there.

36
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:34,786
What? Impossible... I leaked that stuff
about the will getting changed yesterday.

37
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:38,025
Hey, did you say you were looking
for a big boy, like a full-size?

38
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:39,963
Go away.

39
00:02:40,335 --> 00:02:42,148
Thing's a rag anyway.

40
00:02:43,173 --> 00:02:45,427
- Security tape, Ms. Bridgewell.
- Hi, I'm Detective O'Hara.

41
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,041
- Sophie.
- Wait, you're the curator?

42
00:02:47,061 --> 00:02:49,270
- Assistant curator.
- I'd like to speak to someone in charge.

43
00:02:49,328 --> 00:02:51,483
- I am in charge.
- She sounds in charge.

44
00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:55,522
- The Mummy room's this way. Please follow me.
- Where's the curator?

45
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:58,548
He's in Egypt procuring the rest of
this collection, but I assure you

46
00:02:58,668 --> 00:03:01,688
There's no need. He's been working
all night. Can you catch us up?

47
00:03:01,808 --> 00:03:04,984
This exhibit just opened yesterday.
I don't know how this is possible.

48
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,135
It was a prank or some sort of dare.

49
00:03:07,564 --> 00:03:10,316
It's a 3,000-year-old Mummy
that's missing, officer.

50
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:12,328
It's Detective and it's not
like it was covered in gold.

51
00:03:12,448 --> 00:03:14,596
I mean he wasn't a king or a prince
or even a royal food taster.

52
00:03:14,626 --> 00:03:17,848
He was just some guy who happened to die, got
himself wrapped up, and was found in a pretty,

53
00:03:17,868 --> 00:03:19,693
cracked box. He probably mummified himself.

54
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:22,492
He hasn't had his coffee yet.
Has anyone found the night watchman?

55
00:03:22,612 --> 00:03:24,796
- I'm afraid not.
- Night watchman: Douglas F. Hastings,

56
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:28,196
47, three counts of felony
burglary on his record.

57
00:03:28,316 --> 00:03:30,702
- Technically, burglary is a felony.
- Two charges dropped.

58
00:03:30,822 --> 00:03:32,581
Don't you people run background checks?

59
00:03:32,607 --> 00:03:35,253
Doug was a very good employee
who's been here seven years.

60
00:03:35,373 --> 00:03:37,136
And we have a complex security system.

61
00:03:37,256 --> 00:03:39,155
Which was due to be
overhauled last spring.

62
00:03:39,203 --> 00:03:41,677
We pushed it back. We have a very abulic
board of Directors.

63
00:03:41,797 --> 00:03:43,984
Good, I'd like to speak with each one
of them as soon as the sun rises.

64
00:03:44,104 --> 00:03:46,933
Now if you'll forgive us, we have several
high-profile cases that don't involve

65
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:48,688
archaic security systems
in rundown buildings.

66
00:03:48,808 --> 00:03:51,581
O'Hara, put out an apb
on the guard's vehicle,

67
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:53,770
look up the word "abulic"
and meet us back at the station.

68
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:58,705
Just a minute! I don't know
who you are, Detective,

69
00:03:58,825 --> 00:04:00,156
but this was no prank.

70
00:04:00,276 --> 00:04:02,419
The alarm was triggered from the inside.

71
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:04,544
And although our archaic
security footage

72
00:04:04,664 --> 00:04:07,364
was limited to rotating shots
of the four main rooms,

73
00:04:07,484 --> 00:04:09,146
not a single image shows the culprit

74
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:11,505
or the Mummy being carried
from the building.

75
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,901
She's right. It's all right here.

76
00:04:14,436 --> 00:04:18,464
The mummy disappeared in 15 seconds or
less and our main feed picked up none of it.

77
00:04:18,743 --> 00:04:21,476
This all cracks of something
larger than petty crime.

78
00:04:21,704 --> 00:04:25,630
And not to sound too shirley mcclain,
screams of something potentially...

79
00:04:26,043 --> 00:04:27,660
Supernatural.

80
00:04:29,163 --> 00:04:31,957
This requires someone with skills
beyond the normal person.

81
00:04:32,691 --> 00:04:33,970
I want him.

82
00:04:43,687 --> 00:04:46,124
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

83
00:04:48,007 --> 00:04:49,424
Do you think he's up?

84
00:04:54,677 --> 00:04:55,872
Hello?

85
00:04:56,407 --> 00:04:57,370
Jules!

86
00:04:57,992 --> 00:05:00,268
Actually I'm wide awake.
Why do you ask?

87
00:05:00,388 --> 00:05:02,407
You want to watch a movie together
over the phone?

88
00:05:02,527 --> 00:05:04,358
Please say it's father of the bride two.

89
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:05,962
How about Captain ron?

90
00:05:06,104 --> 00:05:07,365
Pure luck?

91
00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:09,205
You don't have anything
with martin short?

92
00:05:11,434 --> 00:05:12,897
Hold on a second.

93
00:05:18,847 --> 00:05:20,987
Well, you don't have to get snippy.

94
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:23,098
You're the one that drunk-dialed me.

95
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:25,076
Really?

96
00:05:25,364 --> 00:05:27,993
I just assumed...
I mean, it's 4:25, right?

97
00:05:28,401 --> 00:05:29,756
The Museum?

98
00:05:29,876 --> 00:05:32,044
- Are you kidding?
- They love me down there.

99
00:05:32,164 --> 00:05:33,308
You see my plaque?

100
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,890
- What's wrong?
- They only put one name on there.

101
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,378
- So?
- So Gus is gonna have an aneurysm,

102
00:05:41,498 --> 00:05:42,888
and not the good kind.

103
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:45,729
Spencer, we can rehash good times later.
Right now I really need you to create

104
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:47,724
some semblance of focus.

105
00:05:48,286 --> 00:05:51,275
Missing Mummy, missing guard,
old security system.

106
00:05:51,395 --> 00:05:54,398
Please tell our feisty little assistant curator
that this was not some elaborate break-in

107
00:05:54,518 --> 00:05:55,955
so we can all go home.

108
00:05:56,075 --> 00:05:57,577
Okay, I'll try.

109
00:05:58,213 --> 00:05:59,866
That a real beaver?

110
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,198
- Shawn Spencer.
- I know.

111
00:06:06,318 --> 00:06:08,257
- Sophie Morris Bridgewell.
- I know.

112
00:06:08,377 --> 00:06:11,249
- Everyone certainly loves you down here.
- And I love you...

113
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:13,220
Metaphorically. What?

114
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,651
You had your shot.

115
00:06:15,746 --> 00:06:17,521
Let me do what I do.

116
00:06:19,988 --> 00:06:21,362
Excuse me, i'll need some space.

117
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:22,678
Thank you.

118
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:51,378
Have it.

119
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:53,268
- Have it.
- Want it.

120
00:06:53,388 --> 00:06:55,407
- Have it.
- Mine's bigger.

121
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:01,226
- I have a problem.
- What is it?

122
00:07:01,346 --> 00:07:03,337
The layout of this display is horrible.

123
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:04,716
Who designed this?

124
00:07:04,836 --> 00:07:06,771
It's ridiculous. Really?

125
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,402
We need two of these?

126
00:07:08,549 --> 00:07:11,475
- Queen nurfurtittie.
- Nefertiti.

127
00:07:11,595 --> 00:07:13,274
I've heard it both ways.

128
00:07:40,492 --> 00:07:41,499
Well?

129
00:07:41,619 --> 00:07:45,370
I'm gonna have to concur with Detective
Carlito Lassiteros on this one.

130
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:48,465
That Mummy was not stolen,
Ms. Bridgewell.

131
00:07:48,585 --> 00:07:51,563
- Great.
- I'm afraid it walked out...

132
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:53,680
All on its own.

133
00:08:00,635 --> 00:08:04,475
<i>Psych 216 Final Season</i>

136
00:08:15,234 --> 00:08:18,610
<i>- www.forom.com </i>

137
00:08:23,534 --> 00:08:26,037
The Mummy walked out?
Come on, you're just trying to impress

138
00:08:26,157 --> 00:08:29,345
- that pretty little assistant curator.
- Was she pretty? I hadn't noticed.

139
00:08:29,465 --> 00:08:33,820
Really? Brown eyes, languid smile,
long slender neck of a balanchine dancer.

140
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,502
I had three different hairstyles
last week and you didn't comment on one.

141
00:08:36,622 --> 00:08:40,542
Look, I felt that something got up
out of that coffin and walked away,

142
00:08:40,662 --> 00:08:42,031
not to the exit,

143
00:08:42,151 --> 00:08:43,818
but to the body of the museum.

144
00:08:43,938 --> 00:08:45,168
Good, you're here.

145
00:08:45,288 --> 00:08:47,473
All of you in my office.

146
00:08:47,747 --> 00:08:50,268
Sweet, now you got us in trouble.

147
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:02,390
What I have to say is very... difficult.

148
00:09:02,534 --> 00:09:06,245
If this in any way pertains to Lassiter's
third testicle, i'm afraid we already know.

149
00:09:07,215 --> 00:09:10,119
This is no time for jokes, Mr. Spencer.

150
00:09:14,327 --> 00:09:17,287
When I accepted this position
on an interim basis,

151
00:09:17,407 --> 00:09:20,575
the agreement between myself and
the mayor was should things work out

152
00:09:20,695 --> 00:09:24,004
at an appropriate time, the interim
would be removed from the title.

153
00:09:24,124 --> 00:09:28,224
As you know that has not yet happened.
And recently I gave the mayor a deadline,

154
00:09:28,344 --> 00:09:31,801
a deadline that has passed
without any sort of response.

155
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,669
So effective friday,
i'm stepping down as chief.

156
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:37,851
- What?
- I'm leaving.

157
00:09:37,971 --> 00:09:39,841
You can't do that! Do they know?

158
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:41,315
Oh, they know.

159
00:09:41,435 --> 00:09:43,400
I'll write a letter. I'll start a petition.

160
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,968
I'll leak it to the reporter
at the mirror.

161
00:09:45,088 --> 00:09:47,445
O'Hara, please. Thank you.

162
00:09:47,609 --> 00:09:50,628
I appreciate the sentiment,
but the die is cast.

163
00:09:50,748 --> 00:09:51,810
Chief...

164
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,115
Are you sure you don't want
to wait it out just a little bit longer?

165
00:09:55,235 --> 00:09:57,519
- You never...
- No, Mr. Spencer.

166
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,403
- So you're saying the job is open.
- What?

167
00:10:00,963 --> 00:10:02,627
I mean, did anyone mention my name?

168
00:10:02,747 --> 00:10:04,542
I believe they have someone in mind.

169
00:10:04,662 --> 00:10:06,058
But you don't know if it's me.

170
00:10:06,178 --> 00:10:09,841
Look, chief, let me just offer
that I think you're a great chief.

171
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:13,990
And, uh, I'm sure things
will all work out.

172
00:10:16,707 --> 00:10:18,285
That's all for now.

173
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,085
Go!

174
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:41,409
What are you watching?

175
00:10:42,188 --> 00:10:44,298
Security videos from the Museum.

176
00:10:44,418 --> 00:10:46,528
Videos? As in actual video tapes?

177
00:10:46,648 --> 00:10:49,189
Well, their system
could use an overhaul.

178
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:52,173
Where are the tapes
from the other cameras?

179
00:10:52,293 --> 00:10:53,375
That's it.

180
00:10:53,495 --> 00:10:55,714
- One tape?
- Yeah, it's on a rotation.

181
00:10:55,834 --> 00:10:57,789
It's actually not a bad system, you know?

182
00:10:57,909 --> 00:11:01,018
It appears you can't leave the Museum
without getting caught by the cameras.

183
00:11:01,138 --> 00:11:02,376
So it's efficient.

184
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,004
Maybe.

185
00:11:04,124 --> 00:11:07,281
We should, probably check it out
for ourselves, though.

186
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:09,311
- What say you?
- Sure.

187
00:11:10,281 --> 00:11:13,928
There's one thing you should
probably know before we get there.

188
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,565
"Paleo-sleuth Shawn Spencer."

189
00:11:19,685 --> 00:11:21,312
- I know.
- I dug that thing up too.

190
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:24,963
Gus, believe me, I was appalled
myself at first... Sickened, really.

191
00:11:25,446 --> 00:11:28,171
But then I noticed, look,
the didn't forget you completely.

192
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:31,223
- Where?
- There, right there! The "photo by" section.

193
00:11:31,343 --> 00:11:33,094
That says "photo by Bruton Gaster."

194
00:11:33,214 --> 00:11:36,637
Well I gave 'em the info when I was driving
through a tunnel, so that probably played a role.

195
00:11:36,757 --> 00:11:38,565
I want a new plaque, Shawn.
I want it tomorrow.

196
00:11:38,685 --> 00:11:40,936
I want my name in big yellow
letters that blink.

197
00:11:41,056 --> 00:11:43,062
And why won't you even tell me
what this museum case is about?

198
00:11:43,182 --> 00:11:44,569
In time, in time.

199
00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:46,204
Gentlemen, thank you for coming.

200
00:11:46,324 --> 00:11:49,699
Mr. Spencer, very good to see you again.
And you must be Mr. Gastor.

201
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:53,092
Guster, Burton Guster.
You people ever hear of spell checker?

202
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,553
I was just giving gasty
here all the specifics.

203
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,825
Yes, well the exhibit just opened
yesterday afternoon without a hitch.

204
00:11:58,945 --> 00:12:01,181
- The alarm went off at 3:00 a.m.
- I was here at 5:00.

205
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:02,414
- A.m.?
- You were not.

206
00:12:02,534 --> 00:12:03,990
- I was, I was working.
- Doing what?

207
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,712
It was a private case. Look, I don't think
we should bore Ms. Bridgewell here

208
00:12:06,832 --> 00:12:08,144
with the complexities
of our other investigations.

209
00:12:08,264 --> 00:12:09,964
You're not tailing cheating
boyfriends again, are you?

210
00:12:10,084 --> 00:12:12,304
- Gus, come on. I'm trying to look cool.
- I told you before, Shawn.

211
00:12:12,424 --> 00:12:14,422
We are bigger than that. We cleared,
like, 50 bucks on the last one.

212
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:18,011
Gus... psychic-client privilege
and what not? Come on.

213
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:20,707
- Shall we continue?
- Yes, this way.

214
00:12:21,378 --> 00:12:23,002
- What's wrong with you?
- You stole my picture!

215
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:25,491
So the bulk of the activity
seems to have occurred in here.

216
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,604
Yes, I can see it.

217
00:12:27,724 --> 00:12:30,253
The lid sliding off the being rising up,

218
00:12:30,373 --> 00:12:32,699
walking across the floor
not unlike an egyptian.

219
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:34,663
Gus could show you.

220
00:12:35,943 --> 00:12:37,235
- Gus!
- Nope.

221
00:12:37,355 --> 00:12:39,768
- No what?
- You know I'm not walking into that room, Shawn.

222
00:12:39,888 --> 00:12:42,674
Come on, dude. I thought this
was over in the sixth grade.

223
00:12:42,822 --> 00:12:44,293
What's wrong?

224
00:12:44,413 --> 00:12:46,632
He won't break the plane
of the Mummy room.

225
00:12:46,864 --> 00:12:48,161
Why not?

226
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,891
He's afraid of being cursed.

227
00:12:50,488 --> 00:12:53,740
- He's not that far off base really.
- Please don't coddle him.

228
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,767
Every one of those guys
that unearthed tut's tomb... Cursed.

229
00:12:56,887 --> 00:12:58,846
- They're all dead now.
- Of course they are.

230
00:12:58,966 --> 00:13:01,272
That was over 80 years ago. Come on, man.

231
00:13:01,392 --> 00:13:04,087
This is gonna be good for you.
Walk to me. Face your fears.

232
00:13:04,207 --> 00:13:07,791
You can talk all you want,
but facts and logic will win out this time.

233
00:13:07,911 --> 00:13:11,068
Facts and logic are in the corner of the guy
who thinks he's gonna get his face melted off?

234
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:12,852
I'm not hearing it, Shawn.

235
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,985
Well you wanted to check
the cameras, right?

236
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,356
Will you set foot
in the security camera room?

237
00:13:22,897 --> 00:13:25,235
This system's actually
better than I thought.

238
00:13:25,355 --> 00:13:27,948
Even if you make it out of one room, you get
picked up in the next room immediately.

239
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:30,256
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna try and beat the system.

240
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:33,384
Watch me, just on the center screen.
See if I can get out.

241
00:13:33,504 --> 00:13:36,341
- All I gotta do is sit here... fine.
- Yeah, we'll communicate on the phone,

242
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:40,069
- so give me a call.
- No, you call me. This is my work cell.

243
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:42,360
- I'm not paying for that call.
- Gus, it's usage minutes.

244
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,176
It doesn't matter
which one of us makes the call.

245
00:13:44,296 --> 00:13:45,661
Just call me, Shawn.

246
00:13:45,793 --> 00:13:47,085
Fine.

247
00:13:50,946 --> 00:13:54,021
I'm sorry, I can't let this go.
It's a monthly plan. It's a minutes plan.

248
00:13:54,141 --> 00:13:56,227
Can we get started with this thing now?

249
00:14:09,358 --> 00:14:12,176
I saw that. Got it on two angles.

250
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,730
Do you want to give this up any time soon?

251
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,221
You're crawling.

252
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:24,431
I see you, Shawn.
You're behind the plant.

253
00:14:25,017 --> 00:14:27,453
See you there. See you there.

254
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,071
The plant is moving
across the room, Shawn.

255
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,648
Leave that poor lady alone, Shawn.

256
00:14:37,594 --> 00:14:39,339
You're using the carpet?

257
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:43,143
Really? Wait a minute...
I almost bought that for a second.

258
00:14:43,473 --> 00:14:45,764
You're using the wolf pelt?

259
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:49,021
This is like watching entrapment
if instead of Catherine Zeta-Jones

260
00:14:49,141 --> 00:14:53,170
- they had some guy with pancake butt.
- I do not have pancake butt!

261
00:14:54,387 --> 00:14:56,502
- What you got? You got something?
- Yep.

262
00:14:56,622 --> 00:14:58,806
Really?
You can see me right now?

263
00:14:58,926 --> 00:15:00,797
- Horrid, Shawny boy.
- Horrid.

264
00:15:03,498 --> 00:15:05,823
Great, now I gotta watch this?

265
00:15:07,257 --> 00:15:08,867
You're muting me?

266
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:11,038
For the first interesting thing
that's happened?

267
00:15:11,305 --> 00:15:13,924
"Look at me, look at me. "I love my hair.

268
00:15:14,044 --> 00:15:16,758
"I can make obscure '80s references
"that nobody understands.

269
00:15:16,878 --> 00:15:18,292
"Laugh at me.

270
00:15:20,008 --> 00:15:21,951
"Hey, know something about me?

271
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:24,662
"I have a motorcycle, but I never seem
to be riding it."

272
00:15:24,782 --> 00:15:27,156
- How about this? Are you seeing this?
- Yep.

273
00:15:27,276 --> 00:15:30,381
- How about now? You see this?
- Terrible.

274
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:33,212
- How about this? You seeing this?
- If you're gonna hide under a barrel,

275
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,479
don't put the phone next to your ear.

276
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:37,615
You're getting all of this?
You can see all of this?

277
00:15:37,735 --> 00:15:38,766
Yep.

278
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:41,192
Whoa, I lost you.

279
00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:44,281
There you are.

280
00:15:44,495 --> 00:15:46,636
Ha! I got you.

281
00:15:46,804 --> 00:15:48,454
For one second, Shawn.

282
00:15:50,473 --> 00:15:53,281
Trying that corner again?
Please.

283
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:55,919
Shawn?

284
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,441
Eh... great.

285
00:15:58,598 --> 00:16:00,505
Now you wore down my battery.

286
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:04,265
Where are you?

287
00:16:08,472 --> 00:16:10,455
How about now?

288
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,013
Bingo.

289
00:16:14,754 --> 00:16:18,087
I'm sure you can understand, Mr. Wyles,
why I've been so motivated

290
00:16:18,207 --> 00:16:20,705
by what I've uncovered in this investigation.

291
00:16:20,825 --> 00:16:24,386
Well, all I know, detective, is I certainly
seem to see your name in the paper every day.

292
00:16:24,512 --> 00:16:25,814
Really?

293
00:16:25,934 --> 00:16:28,541
Which paper would that be, because you
know I've missed some of the coverage.

294
00:16:28,661 --> 00:16:31,125
- Can we just get on with what you want?
- Of course. It's really

295
00:16:31,245 --> 00:16:34,521
just more of a formality than anything.
I wasn't even going to call you in today.

296
00:16:34,641 --> 00:16:37,807
I just need to go over a few bank
records and see some papers

297
00:16:37,927 --> 00:16:41,194
- and exhume your father's body.
- I'm sorry. What was that last one?

298
00:16:41,314 --> 00:16:45,721
Oh, uh, it's just more of a technical detail
than anything exhuming your father's body.

299
00:16:45,841 --> 00:16:49,761
I mean, you wouldn't even have to be there. I
could have him back in eternal slumber by noon.

300
00:16:50,016 --> 00:16:51,951
1:45 at the latest.

301
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:54,378
- This place is gonna close soon.
- No, it's not.

302
00:16:54,498 --> 00:16:57,851
Shawn, I was in there forever. Somebody's
shutting off the lights with us in here.

303
00:16:57,971 --> 00:16:59,897
Pretty sure that's a timer.

304
00:17:01,131 --> 00:17:03,614
Why would they set a timer
with people still in here?

305
00:17:03,755 --> 00:17:06,298
'cause the museum closed 20 minutes ago?

306
00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:11,620
How did they close it with us inside?

307
00:17:11,801 --> 00:17:15,716
Well, remember I said I talked to Sophie
the curator? She's very sweet, by the way.

308
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:19,394
She loves red robin. Isn't that
a strange favorite restaurant.

309
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:23,111
You're going behind the tarp? Really?

310
00:17:23,231 --> 00:17:25,364
There's an exit behind the tarp?

311
00:17:25,484 --> 00:17:27,741
You're probably gonna be eaten
by carpet beetles.

312
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:31,914
Look, I discovered a number of intriguing
things when I was figuring out how to crack

313
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:35,492
the security cameras, including an exhibit
that looked like it had already been

314
00:17:35,612 --> 00:17:37,519
broken into, so what I'm thinking is

315
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,061
whoever did it might come back
because anyone on the inside

316
00:17:40,181 --> 00:17:42,991
knows that there's no night
guard on duty and...

317
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:44,559
And what?

318
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:47,068
- Sophie said it was cool.
- What was cool?

319
00:17:47,188 --> 00:17:50,575
Come on, man. Haven't you ever wanted to spend a
night in the museum? You know, do it up with all

320
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:53,001
the stuffed creatures and the bones?

321
00:17:53,121 --> 00:17:56,165
No, Shawn, I haven't.
I can't spend the night in the museum.

322
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:59,542
I don't have my tooth brush.
I don't have any of my multivitamins.

323
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:03,005
And oh, yeah, I don't want my soul
suffering eternal damnation

324
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,465
for disrupting the sleep of
an egyptian canal digger.

325
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,759
Come on, dude!

326
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:09,789
With hastings on the lam,
they're fresh out of night watchmen.

327
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:13,317
Sophie was actually quite happy
that I offered. She's taking me to dinner.

328
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,856
What do they have at red robin?

329
00:18:20,387 --> 00:18:24,940
Come on, Gus. They didn't get what they were looking
for the first time. Maybe they'll break in again.

330
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,706
We'll be here to catch 'em red-handed.
Won't that be cool?

331
00:18:27,964 --> 00:18:31,800
Dude, there's probably a sensor
of some sort. Take a step back.

332
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:35,111
Okay, now try it.

333
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:42,058
- What's on the hill?
- That's freedom, Shawn.

334
00:18:42,178 --> 00:18:45,085
- Does that look like a camera?
- No, no one's gonna leave their camera

335
00:18:45,205 --> 00:18:48,505
- outside in the mist so it can get ruined.
- Looks like a camera to me.

336
00:18:48,898 --> 00:18:51,328
- We caught a break.
- We caught a break.

337
00:18:51,508 --> 00:18:54,870
Hastings, that security guard from the Museum
who's still missing, had a few assault charges

338
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,678
on his record that never went to trial.

339
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,437
Hastings is way more violent
than we thought.

340
00:18:59,557 --> 00:19:02,024
- And we found the car finally.
- They found his car.

341
00:19:02,144 --> 00:19:04,834
- Yeah, it was in the shop actually.
- But you didn't find him?

342
00:19:04,954 --> 00:19:07,106
No, the shop gave him a loaner.
I just thought I would let you know,

343
00:19:07,226 --> 00:19:08,955
give you a heads up, see
if you come up with anything.

344
00:19:09,075 --> 00:19:12,027
- What kind of car is the loaner?
- Gray gmc pickup.

345
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,139
- Don't be mad.
- Why would I be mad?

346
00:19:39,313 --> 00:19:41,986
I'm locked in a museum with
possibly a violent criminal

347
00:19:42,106 --> 00:19:43,855
and probably an angry Mummy spirit.

348
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:47,051
And here's a bonus:
we have no phones.

349
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:49,618
- I told you to charge that phone.
- You did not.

350
00:19:49,738 --> 00:19:51,027
I didn't?

351
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:52,922
Does thinking it count?

352
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,198
They might have a snack bar.

353
00:19:56,412 --> 00:19:58,625
You know, maybe that truck
wasn't gray, dude.

354
00:19:58,745 --> 00:20:00,971
Maybe it was, like, a deep midnight blue

355
00:20:01,048 --> 00:20:04,510
Or a black or a nicekelly green.
It's hard to know for sure.

356
00:20:04,631 --> 00:20:07,259
You know, the cones in the eyes
make it possibleto see at night.

357
00:20:07,297 --> 00:20:10,789
I know how the eyes work, Shawn. I just
hope I still have minein the morning.

358
00:20:10,854 --> 00:20:12,609
Where exactly are we?
He's here.

359
00:20:12,668 --> 00:20:15,022
He's gonna come back.
He's gonna kill us.

360
00:20:15,095 --> 00:20:17,255
Dude, I never said
hastingsstole the thing.

361
00:20:17,314 --> 00:20:19,745
No,
you think the actual Mummy walked out.

362
00:20:19,835 --> 00:20:21,185
That makes me feel better.

363
00:20:21,276 --> 00:20:24,426
Don't go all"glass half empty" on me.
Let me show you what I found.

364
00:20:26,195 --> 00:20:28,167
What is wrong.
With this flag?

365
00:20:28,605 --> 00:20:29,644
Everything.

366
00:20:29,685 --> 00:20:31,102
- Besides that.
- I don't know.

367
00:20:31,122 --> 00:20:33,529
- It's upside-down.
- And backwards. What's your point?

368
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:38,084
It's dust gathered on the bottom
of the frame.

369
00:20:38,748 --> 00:20:41,603
That means somebody eitherturned
it upside-down or knocked it over.

370
00:20:44,608 --> 00:20:45,292
Whoa,

371
00:20:45,413 --> 00:20:47,594
I lost you for a second.
There you are.

372
00:20:47,632 --> 00:20:50,240
And this little nook
is not in camera range.

373
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,219
It's not a nook.

374
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:53,500
What would you call it?
It's clearly nota corner.

375
00:20:53,737 --> 00:20:55,414
Cranny? Will you sign off on Cranny?

376
00:20:55,473 --> 00:20:57,229
- Why am I here, Shawn?
- Because

377
00:20:57,407 --> 00:21:00,918
somebody didn't want the camera
to see what ever happened in this Cranny.

378
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,645
I never signed off on Cranny.
There's nothing here, Gus.

379
00:21:03,665 --> 00:21:05,182
It's just a bunch of old guns.

380
00:21:08,442 --> 00:21:09,931
And not even nice onesat that.

381
00:21:10,177 --> 00:21:12,357
The lexan glass case that houses
it is worth more.

382
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,206
- Lexan glass?
- Yeah, it's bullet proof.

383
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,885
Well, it would have to be in case
the guns decided to fire them selves.

384
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:20,066
Lexan glass.

385
00:21:20,215 --> 00:21:21,025
What?

386
00:21:21,129 --> 00:21:23,395
That's common know ledge, Shawn.
People know that.

387
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:25,495
Who, people in Charlton Heston's house?

388
00:21:25,515 --> 00:21:27,144
Yes, and your Mama.

389
00:21:33,227 --> 00:21:34,519
Did you hear that?

390
00:21:34,745 --> 00:21:36,416
Nobody's here but us.

391
00:21:36,506 --> 00:21:38,541
I tried, Shawn.
I can't do this.

392
00:21:38,683 --> 00:21:40,414
Gus, don't bea traveling wilbury.

393
00:21:40,448 --> 00:21:42,695
- Look, Christine's here.
- Will you stop it, Shawn?

394
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:44,689
Relax, it's not eventhe right color.

395
00:21:45,698 --> 00:21:46,624
Dude.

396
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:49,410
We have got to get one
of these for the office.

397
00:21:49,525 --> 00:21:51,230
How much you think these things run?

398
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,293
- I don't know.
- How heavy are they?

399
00:21:56,051 --> 00:21:57,870
That was actually kind of scary, Gus.

400
00:21:59,165 --> 00:22:02,540
Come on, dude!
It's just the motoron the fridge!

401
00:22:03,339 --> 00:22:07,062
Of course,
why wouldan exhibit be plugged in?

402
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:12,762
The sign says do not touch, Shawn.

403
00:22:12,782 --> 00:22:14,251
Not anymore.

404
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,292
- It's stuck, though.
- It's supposed to be stuck.

405
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,771
To keep people like you out.

406
00:22:19,095 --> 00:22:20,098
People who what?

407
00:22:20,145 --> 00:22:22,175
People who spend the night in Museums
to investigate Mummies

408
00:22:22,225 --> 00:22:23,845
that may have walked out on their own?

409
00:22:57,518 --> 00:22:58,734
You are here.

410
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,260
What are you doing?

411
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:01,493
Bidding for Talismans.

412
00:23:01,555 --> 00:23:02,686
Talismen.

413
00:23:02,795 --> 00:23:04,605
I don't care what they're called, Shawn.

414
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:07,763
I'm acquiring protection for the spiritual
injustice we caused in the Museum.

415
00:23:08,139 --> 00:23:10,680
- You can buy wolfsbane online?
- In bulk.

416
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:13,225
Now I just gotta find somebody
to Loan me a cat.

417
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,000
- You got mcnabb's number?
- Come on, Gus.

418
00:23:16,175 --> 00:23:18,553
I thought that, at the very least,
finding the guard dead would

419
00:23:18,573 --> 00:23:21,955
help you jump on the band wagon that,
hey, this is a realflesh and blood killer.

420
00:23:22,055 --> 00:23:24,065
He was killed by the Mummy, Shawn.

421
00:23:24,138 --> 00:23:25,939
You don't know that.
You have no proof.

422
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:29,771
Okay, fine, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I didn't
tell you I signed us up for night guard duty.

423
00:23:29,815 --> 00:23:32,038
And I'm sorry I didn't tell
you there was a Mummy involved.

424
00:23:32,058 --> 00:23:35,595
But we have a legitimate trail now.
The copsare taking this seriously.

425
00:23:35,696 --> 00:23:38,540
I need you! I need the sweet blue shirt,
I need the pants.

426
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,413
I need the winsome smile that
hides the sad Jamaican clown inside.

427
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,791
We need to call Lassiter
and we are not going back to the Museum.

428
00:23:45,097 --> 00:23:47,840
No more Mummy room,
no more Spooky stuff.

429
00:23:48,962 --> 00:23:49,946
I promise.

430
00:23:53,447 --> 00:23:54,914
He's exhuming a body?

431
00:23:55,015 --> 00:23:59,020
He is casually disturbing what should be
the passing of a great and dignified man.

432
00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:00,679
Yeah,he does that.

433
00:24:04,718 --> 00:24:06,126
White socks, black shoes.

434
00:24:06,146 --> 00:24:09,276
What's the rule on that? Don't you have
to be wearing jeans? What's the rule?

435
00:24:09,903 --> 00:24:13,755
Come on dude. I honestly had no idea he was
gonna be pulling a corpse from the ground.

436
00:24:13,775 --> 00:24:15,165
Don't worry about it, Shawn.

437
00:24:15,196 --> 00:24:18,140
I honestly didn't know I was gonna be
putting my foot in your ass.

438
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:20,074
Life's full of surprises.

439
00:24:20,171 --> 00:24:22,494
I got the coroner's reporton
the guard hastings.

440
00:24:22,596 --> 00:24:25,465
At least stay for this, see how silly
it is to be afraid of Mummies.

441
00:24:25,485 --> 00:24:26,750
What do you got, Jules?

442
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,100
- You're not gonna like it.
- We're not gonna like it.

443
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,212
- I'm sure we'll be able to make something of it.
- Hastings was strangled to death.

444
00:24:32,861 --> 00:24:35,728
No magic involved there.
And correct me if I'm wrong Jules,

445
00:24:35,795 --> 00:24:38,544
but you can actually get fingerprints
off strangulation victims.

446
00:24:38,658 --> 00:24:40,765
- I'm afraid that's not possible.
- Why is that?

447
00:24:40,925 --> 00:24:42,820
The hand was wrappedin
some sort of cloth.

448
00:24:43,219 --> 00:24:44,116
Cloth?

449
00:24:44,136 --> 00:24:46,441
There were linen fibers embedded
into the guard's neck.

450
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,865
Clearly that was just
to cover his prints.

451
00:24:48,885 --> 00:24:51,793
We also found Dust and Spores
that weren't from this area.

452
00:24:51,972 --> 00:24:54,113
Well, maybe the cleaning
crew didn't come around.

453
00:24:54,256 --> 00:24:56,918
Only if they didn't come
aroundfor over 3,000 years.

454
00:24:56,975 --> 00:24:59,431
The spores camefrom inside the coffin.

455
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:02,236
Thanks, Jules.

456
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:10,424
Finally!

457
00:25:10,505 --> 00:25:11,384
Finally what?

458
00:25:12,343 --> 00:25:15,555
- I've been leaving message son your phone.
- Yeah, I sor tof dropped my phone.

459
00:25:15,575 --> 00:25:17,715
Yeah, what'd I tell youa bout
taking care of your stuff?

460
00:25:17,745 --> 00:25:20,335
You know what? You're right. First
my tricycle out in the yard, now this.

461
00:25:20,355 --> 00:25:22,862
- I see a pattern developing here.
- All right, look, Shawn,

462
00:25:23,019 --> 00:25:24,595
I was hoping we could talk alone.

463
00:25:24,819 --> 00:25:25,920
No offense, Gus.

464
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,378
- Di!
- No no, don't you dare.

465
00:25:27,398 --> 00:25:29,535
We are here
to talk to you and this is urgent.

466
00:25:29,555 --> 00:25:31,453
- So is mine.
- Ours involves a dead guy.

467
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,731
- Why do you always have to win, Shawn?
- 'Cause we're winners.

468
00:25:35,885 --> 00:25:37,584
Fine, what is it? Go ahead.

469
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,681
Okay,

470
00:25:39,923 --> 00:25:42,624
what do you do when your best suspect.

471
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,901
Sort of,
just.

472
00:25:46,025 --> 00:25:47,896
- Say it, Shawn.
- Doesn't exist

473
00:25:48,198 --> 00:25:49,117
anymore?

474
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:52,033
People disappear all the time, Shawn.
Some are very good at it.

475
00:25:52,053 --> 00:25:53,445
Especially a career criminal.

476
00:25:53,465 --> 00:25:55,205
Yeah, this is a little more complicated.

477
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:57,075
Look, it doesn't matter who
you're talking about here, Shawn.

478
00:25:57,142 --> 00:25:59,442
But when the trail goes cold,
you do what every good cop does.

479
00:25:59,462 --> 00:26:03,010
You follow the time line. You trace back
the steps that led to the trail going cold.

480
00:26:03,321 --> 00:26:04,797
- Back ground check.
- Exactly.

481
00:26:04,817 --> 00:26:06,109
Perfect. Perfect, dad!

482
00:26:06,245 --> 00:26:08,185
But I wanna see you later, without Gus.

483
00:26:08,205 --> 00:26:09,408
I need to talk to you.

484
00:26:09,795 --> 00:26:11,165
Okay, what is this?

485
00:26:11,395 --> 00:26:14,421
What is all this "without Gus" stuff?
I mean, it's Gus. Just say it.

486
00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:17,580
- Say what it is. What is it?
- Okay. All right.

487
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:23,070
I got a phone calla couple
of days ago and.

488
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,710
I don't know if you have any plans,
but.

489
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:29,948
Are you busy on saturday?

490
00:26:32,527 --> 00:26:34,649
You want me to come
with you to awkward class?

491
00:26:35,815 --> 00:26:36,953
Forget it.

492
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,633
See ya!

493
00:26:42,016 --> 00:26:46,344
Detectives, that's very thought ful of you,
but I just don't want youto make a big fuss.

494
00:26:46,364 --> 00:26:48,245
We are not going to make a fuss.

495
00:26:48,297 --> 00:26:50,946
Detective Lassiter and i just
ant to throw you a going away party.

496
00:26:51,023 --> 00:26:52,361
It's going to be very.

497
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,395
William wyles the beud.

498
00:26:54,415 --> 00:26:56,983
<i>It was formerly believed that wyles'
death was due</i>

499
00:26:57,003 --> 00:27:00,114
<i>to an accidental fall
down the stairs of his Montecito home.</i>

500
00:27:00,134 --> 00:27:03,135
<i>But now a former employee
has come forward to say.</i>

501
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:07,085
<i>She heard loud arguing coming from
the wyles's study the night of his death.</i>

502
00:27:07,105 --> 00:27:10,665
<i>Contrary to the belief that
wyles was alone the night he died.</i>

503
00:27:10,685 --> 00:27:12,764
<i>Santa Barbara police
detective Carlton Lassiter,</i>

504
00:27:12,784 --> 00:27:16,959
<i>who's been leading this investigation,
was unavailable for comment.</i>

505
00:27:17,056 --> 00:27:19,620
Unavailable for comment?
I've been here all day.

506
00:27:19,836 --> 00:27:21,264
Who's not giving memy messages?

507
00:27:24,845 --> 00:27:26,022
Cupcakes.

508
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:28,071
Right, of course.

509
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,912
With little cuffs on them.

510
00:27:31,035 --> 00:27:32,405
And, sprinkles.

511
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,724
We're really gonna miss you.

512
00:27:34,744 --> 00:27:37,315
<i>Wyles, who became a publishing
magnate at the age of 30,</i>

513
00:27:37,335 --> 00:27:39,675
<i>was one of Santa Barbara's
leading philanthropists</i>

514
00:27:39,695 --> 00:27:42,395
<i>and a major contributor
to political campaigns.</i>

515
00:27:42,415 --> 00:27:45,755
<i>As well as a well-known
collector of war Memorabilia.</i>

516
00:27:45,775 --> 00:27:47,949
<i>At his height, he owned more than 30.</i>

517
00:27:48,026 --> 00:27:50,233
- How's the back ground check coming?
- Just finished.

518
00:27:50,417 --> 00:27:53,095
Rahm entottem lived during the
19th dy Nasty of Egypt.

519
00:27:53,115 --> 00:27:54,345
Probably near Giza.

520
00:27:54,515 --> 00:27:57,625
He had 11 sons, all of whom
spent their days smelting metal

521
00:27:57,645 --> 00:27:59,565
from the orealong the banks of the nile.

522
00:27:59,985 --> 00:28:01,297
Smelters?

523
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,714
Perhaps you misunderstood.

524
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:06,290
We don't care what
he did when he was living.

525
00:28:06,497 --> 00:28:08,059
Only since he's been a Mummy.

526
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:09,460
Let's do this.

527
00:28:09,645 --> 00:28:12,993
First, he was on display
for six months in Cincinnati.

528
00:28:13,235 --> 00:28:14,714
He didn't kill anybody there.

529
00:28:14,827 --> 00:28:17,795
Then he was on Loan, Plano, Texas.

530
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:21,406
Nobody had their eyes
or internal organs stolen there.

531
00:28:21,426 --> 00:28:23,071
- What's that?
- It's a bowl of Chili.

532
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:26,253
- And who's that up there?
- It's Austin kerns. Would you pay attention?

533
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:29,035
Then he was transported for
two days by truck,

534
00:28:29,055 --> 00:28:31,335
spent the evening in
the Museum ware house,

535
00:28:31,355 --> 00:28:33,815
and boom,was on display first
thing the next morning.

536
00:28:33,835 --> 00:28:34,975
Mine's Better.

537
00:28:34,995 --> 00:28:37,585
Yeah, but mine's something
sensible that people might utilize.

538
00:28:37,605 --> 00:28:39,215
So you'rethe sensible one now?

539
00:28:39,235 --> 00:28:41,299
- More and more lately.
- Okay.

540
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,480
All right,
let's work back wards.

541
00:28:44,865 --> 00:28:46,079
We just did.

542
00:28:48,124 --> 00:28:50,005
This is as close
as I get to that Museum.

543
00:28:50,025 --> 00:28:51,950
I know. Quick, put that on.

544
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,155
My name is Shawn Spencer.
I'm working with Sophie and the Museum.

545
00:29:00,175 --> 00:29:02,010
This is my partner Paddy Simcox.

546
00:29:02,235 --> 00:29:05,630
We're wondering if there's any documentation
on the arrival of the rock 'em sock 'em Mummy.

547
00:29:05,803 --> 00:29:06,884
Rahmentottem.

548
00:29:06,939 --> 00:29:10,190
Or has there been any instances of
things exploding for no apparent reason?

549
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,186
I don't know nothing.

550
00:29:12,265 --> 00:29:14,555
- And I don't think you guys should be in here.
- Right.

551
00:29:14,575 --> 00:29:17,579
Perhaps I'll call Sophie and let
her know you're not being very help ful.

552
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:20,970
Listen, all I have security
access for is this room.

553
00:29:21,065 --> 00:29:24,440
Well, then let us know what
happens here, man! Here at the docks!

554
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,248
Fine, it's simple.

555
00:29:26,268 --> 00:29:29,690
That thing shows up, a Museum
rep comes and does an inspection.

556
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,800
And then we put itout on the floor.

557
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:34,212
I wish that there was
more that I could tell you.

558
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:35,763
Dude, it's a tripod.

559
00:29:35,838 --> 00:29:37,555
I told you that was a tripod.

560
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,794
With a camera.
Coming back.

561
00:29:41,195 --> 00:29:42,372
Hey, wait up!

562
00:29:55,897 --> 00:29:57,074
What are you doing?

563
00:29:58,354 --> 00:30:00,185
Left your keys in the trunk lock.

564
00:30:00,205 --> 00:30:03,773
I'm sorry. I know I promised not to shoot there.
I know you guys said you'd call the cops,

565
00:30:03,793 --> 00:30:05,938
but I just need one more night
for my project to be done.

566
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:08,255
- Your project?
- My film project.

567
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,927
- Aren't you guys with the.
- Yes, we are.

568
00:30:09,947 --> 00:30:11,201
- With who?
- Who ever you think we're with.

569
00:30:11,221 --> 00:30:13,705
- The Museum?
- Yes, exactly. And you are a film student?

570
00:30:13,725 --> 00:30:16,427
Yes, working on night cycle.

571
00:30:16,525 --> 00:30:17,935
It's my thes is project.

572
00:30:18,053 --> 00:30:21,391
It's just the life cycle of
a wild flower at the top of the hill.

573
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:24,525
- The name of your film is night cycle?
- What's wrong with that?

574
00:30:24,545 --> 00:30:26,175
Well, it's kind of boring.

575
00:30:26,551 --> 00:30:28,865
Unless it's about a motorcycle
that comes to life at night and

576
00:30:28,885 --> 00:30:30,701
solves crime and does sweet whee lies.

577
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,822
Listen,

578
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,724
I alread y told the guy in the Jumpsuit. I mean,
you could barelysee the Museum in the background.

579
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:38,828
- I just needed to frameit up that way.
- You have foot age of the Museum.

580
00:30:38,884 --> 00:30:41,985
Yeah, but it won't infringe on
anyone's copyright, I can guarantee it.

581
00:30:42,292 --> 00:30:44,067
Do you have stuff from tuesday night?

582
00:30:44,165 --> 00:30:45,486
Yeah, but not on me.

583
00:31:04,615 --> 00:31:05,626
Here it is.

584
00:31:05,677 --> 00:31:08,520
A standard video camera runs
at 30 frames per second.

585
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:10,435
- Yeah, we know that.
- How would we know that?

586
00:31:10,455 --> 00:31:13,525
It's common know ledge, Shawn.
And technically it's 29.97.

587
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:18,615
Unless you're working in Hd, then
it's 23.98 partially segmented frames.

588
00:31:18,635 --> 00:31:22,165
Regard less, for time lapse
I set it for one frames for minute.

589
00:31:22,185 --> 00:31:23,773
So everything moves faster.

590
00:31:23,816 --> 00:31:26,388
- 30 times faster.
- 1,800 times faster.

591
00:31:26,408 --> 00:31:28,418
- I knew that. I was testing you.
- Sure you did.

592
00:31:28,438 --> 00:31:31,413
Okay Guys,
what are we looking for here, exactly?

593
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:32,535
It's pretty simple.

594
00:31:32,555 --> 00:31:34,871
A crime occurre dat the Museum
on this particular evening.

595
00:31:34,891 --> 00:31:37,934
We just wanna know if your camera caught
any foot age of it. It's nothing too crazy.

596
00:31:37,973 --> 00:31:41,792
And most likely there's a crazed Mummy out
and about strangling people willy-nilly.

597
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,020
Yes. And that.

598
00:31:44,735 --> 00:31:45,754
This is 3:00 am.

599
00:31:45,857 --> 00:31:47,227
Slow it down here.

600
00:31:48,227 --> 00:31:49,732
This is kind of exciting.

601
00:32:02,627 --> 00:32:04,881
Holy crap.
Gus, can you believe it?

602
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:06,503
Gus?

603
00:32:09,451 --> 00:32:11,091
He's a little scared of Mummies.

604
00:32:12,147 --> 00:32:13,439
Dude, it's just a film!

605
00:32:13,459 --> 00:32:15,147
- Video.
- Even better.

606
00:32:15,173 --> 00:32:17,471
No one can reach through the screen
and grab you.

607
00:32:18,568 --> 00:32:20,014
That's so weird.

608
00:32:20,582 --> 00:32:23,032
We only saw him for one frame and then,

609
00:32:23,329 --> 00:32:24,925
you know, he walked out and poof.

610
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:26,022
He's gone.

611
00:32:29,428 --> 00:32:30,239
Wait.

612
00:32:30,451 --> 00:32:31,705
The lights on the van.

613
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,751
Dude, he took that van.

614
00:32:37,771 --> 00:32:38,638
The Mummy?

615
00:32:38,685 --> 00:32:39,437
Great.

616
00:32:39,556 --> 00:32:42,562
Now we got a Mummy on the loose and the son
of a bitch know show to drive a stick?

617
00:32:42,582 --> 00:32:44,605
- Now we know how he got away.
- We need to call the Police.

618
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:45,590
No, not yet.

619
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:47,625
- I've seen that van.
- You know where it is?

620
00:32:47,645 --> 00:32:50,324
Unless it's moved in the last two hours,
I do.

621
00:32:52,024 --> 00:32:54,510
What the.
Dude, I told youit was here.

622
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:08,560
I told you I saw it!

623
00:33:22,933 --> 00:33:25,125
What are you doing?
Turning the cararound, Shawn.

624
00:33:25,145 --> 00:33:28,639
Dude, she's not even gonna be in California
by the time we get out of here.

625
00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:30,095
Just keep turning the wheel!

626
00:33:30,115 --> 00:33:32,504
- I don't wanna hit anything, Shawn!
- This is a company car.

627
00:33:32,562 --> 00:33:35,530
Dude, you got it.
You clearly had itafter the se.

628
00:33:36,258 --> 00:33:37,261
Really?

629
00:33:37,962 --> 00:33:39,968
The 11-point turn, dude?

630
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:50,445
This is a prime example of a situation
best handled by the Police.

631
00:33:50,465 --> 00:33:52,745
- Or a witch doctor.
- It's not a Mummy, Gus.

632
00:33:52,765 --> 00:33:55,210
You keep saying that,
and it keeps coming up Mummy.

633
00:33:55,998 --> 00:33:58,010
No way he makes that turn.

634
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,869
Slow down.

635
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,273
He hit a tree.

636
00:34:11,313 --> 00:34:13,361
- Let's go get him.
- I'm not getting out there.

637
00:34:13,938 --> 00:34:15,405
Dude, they hit a tree.

638
00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:18,213
Who ever they are, they're not moving.
They're incapacitated.

639
00:34:18,233 --> 00:34:19,873
They could be hurt, maybe even dead.

640
00:34:19,987 --> 00:34:21,164
Maybe undead.

641
00:34:21,373 --> 00:34:24,145
- They might need our help.
- Or our internal organs!

642
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,469
- Let's call the police.
- With whose phone?

643
00:34:27,805 --> 00:34:28,847
All right, fine.

644
00:34:28,981 --> 00:34:30,119
I'm bringing my bat.

645
00:34:30,245 --> 00:34:31,680
Grab some flash lights.

646
00:35:01,826 --> 00:35:04,180
Shawn,
I think.

647
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:12,500
I think this may be the most terrifying
moment of my life.

648
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:15,084
You're confronting ithead on.

649
00:35:15,258 --> 00:35:16,920
I'm so proud of you, buddy.

650
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,038
I think I just saw someone running
away in the woods.

651
00:35:22,178 --> 00:35:22,969
Look!

652
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:24,430
That door's cracked!

653
00:35:25,116 --> 00:35:26,860
I don't think anybody's here.

654
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,798
How sure are you?

655
00:35:28,818 --> 00:35:30,322
Fairly to pretty damn.

656
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:33,192
Good, because
I don't think I can take one more.

657
00:35:39,451 --> 00:35:40,879
Shawn?

658
00:35:47,226 --> 00:35:50,145
I am telling you, Carly town, you
gotta come with uson this!

659
00:35:50,165 --> 00:35:52,854
And I'm telling you, I'm about
to solve the biggest case of my career.

660
00:35:52,874 --> 00:35:54,796
So which do you think I'd rather do?

661
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,785
The old man didn't die from
a fall down the stairs.

662
00:35:56,805 --> 00:35:59,977
Initial findings indicate he had blunt
force trauma to his head before he fell.

663
00:35:59,997 --> 00:36:03,180
So unless you've gota psychic
answer for that, you guys can run along.

664
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:06,465
Crud. Now Wyles isn't answering his phone.

665
00:36:06,485 --> 00:36:09,010
I have the final coroner's
report on that exhumed body.

666
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,395
It was definitely a head trauma.

667
00:36:10,415 --> 00:36:14,065
And it turns out that unidentified matter
found in his skull was a chip of ivory.

668
00:36:14,085 --> 00:36:15,380
Great.

669
00:36:16,271 --> 00:36:18,025
But I have the best reveal ever.

670
00:36:18,045 --> 00:36:19,495
Spencer, we'll get to
your little mummy thing later.

671
00:36:19,515 --> 00:36:22,879
Quite honestly, I only took the case because
Wyles iv is on the board of trustees.

672
00:36:22,899 --> 00:36:25,500
I thought I could do a little
snooping, but all I got was dead ends.

673
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,330
I can solve both cases!

674
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,937
- You can what?
- Lassie, call Wyles on his cell phone.

675
00:36:32,965 --> 00:36:35,594
He'll pick that up because he's
not at home. Dude, we got it.

676
00:36:35,614 --> 00:36:38,710
- Oh, we are good!
- Then meet us at the Museum.

677
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,695
Why can't they just meet
usat a well-lit starbucks?

678
00:36:40,715 --> 00:36:43,462
One more time, buddy. For justice.

679
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,709
- Why am I here?
- You'll find out soon enough.

680
00:36:46,729 --> 00:36:48,605
But whatever it is, I'm
taking full credit for it.

681
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:50,695
Just cooperate with us, Mr.Wyles.

682
00:36:50,715 --> 00:36:52,425
Things don't look very
good for you right now.

683
00:36:52,445 --> 00:36:54,994
- Yeah, well, I'll have your job.
- Well, it's too late for that.

684
00:36:55,014 --> 00:36:56,761
Someone else already does.

685
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,610
Shawn!

686
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,856
Don't worry, Sophie.
I'm being very gentle.

687
00:37:05,925 --> 00:37:07,823
I laid down a blanke tand everything.

688
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,005
Not my first time alone in a coffin.

689
00:37:10,025 --> 00:37:11,245
By the way.

690
00:37:11,265 --> 00:37:13,520
Playing dead, awesome.

691
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,544
- What is this nonsense?
- He's solving a case.

692
00:37:16,564 --> 00:37:20,169
Actually, I'm solving two cases.
But let's take the mone at a time.

693
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:24,000
First, a being did rise from this coffin.

694
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,812
And walk out of the
museum on tuesday night.

695
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:32,907
Strangled poor hastings, may
he rest in peace, with his bare hands.

696
00:37:33,024 --> 00:37:34,445
Correction,

697
00:37:35,546 --> 00:37:38,825
- linen-wrapped hands.
- Thank you.

698
00:37:38,845 --> 00:37:41,485
I was the first one
to say that it was a Mummy.

699
00:37:41,505 --> 00:37:44,895
But that being was not the mummy.

700
00:37:44,915 --> 00:37:46,944
- Rub-my-bottom.
- Rahmentottem.

701
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:48,545
That mummy never made it into the museum.

702
00:37:48,565 --> 00:37:51,575
No, that mummy never made it out
of the white van in the parking lot.

703
00:37:51,595 --> 00:37:56,388
It was swapped out by an
angry ware house Foreman on wheels.

704
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,630
It was all part of an elaborate break-in.

705
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:01,006
This is absolute insanity.

706
00:38:01,171 --> 00:38:05,305
An interesting choice of words.
I thought for sure you'd say genius.

707
00:38:05,437 --> 00:38:09,172
- Well, why would I say genius?
- Because it was your plan.

708
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,685
My plan?

709
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:13,575
You're the one that got
into the snuffalupagus wrapped in

710
00:38:13,595 --> 00:38:17,848
just enoughte a-stained linen to look
like a mummy through the cracked lid.

711
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:20,420
You needed to get those
pistols back, didn't you?

712
00:38:20,567 --> 00:38:24,905
Yeah, the ones that used to be at the top
of the stairs in your father's house.

713
00:38:24,925 --> 00:38:28,395
Especially that one with
the chipped ivory handle.

714
00:38:28,415 --> 00:38:30,270
- Which.
- which was the murder weapon!

715
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,147
Come on, lass. A little consideration,
please? I mean, look.

716
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,806
I'm going all out with the cloth and
thing here. I'm doing my thing.

717
00:38:36,895 --> 00:38:38,500
- Detectives.
- You knocked your father

718
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,524
on the head with that pistol,
let him fall to his death,

719
00:38:40,544 --> 00:38:43,269
and then ran out and waited
for somebody else to find him.

720
00:38:44,131 --> 00:38:46,630
And the pistol got willed to the Museum.

721
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:50,015
That's why you worked so
hard to get that exhibit closed.

722
00:38:50,035 --> 00:38:52,635
And delayed the installation
of the new security system.

723
00:38:52,655 --> 00:38:55,884
He couldn't get his way into the display.
But he needed to be in the Museum.

724
00:38:55,904 --> 00:38:58,620
You have been a busy little
boy, haven't you?

725
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:02,335
I believe you will be my
final Santa Barbara arrest,  Mr.Wyles.

726
00:39:02,355 --> 00:39:04,530
Put your hands behind your back, sir.

727
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:08,024
Nice, nice... but guys, check it out.
There's more, right?

728
00:39:08,044 --> 00:39:10,680
He tilted the camera so
that he wouldn't be visible.

729
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:14,390
He... he strangled hastings so
there wouldn't be a witness!

730
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:17,900
I saw him run away in the forest!

731
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,025
Gus?

732
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,250
Is there any chance at all you'll stay?

733
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,195
No.

734
00:39:29,215 --> 00:39:31,740
But I'm sure we'll see each other around.

735
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:36,214
Look, I knew the mayor Wante Draymond
sauter for the job. He's an old friend of his.

736
00:39:36,234 --> 00:39:39,375
But Sauter didn't become
available until recently.

737
00:39:39,395 --> 00:39:42,080
So I did what I had to do.

738
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,915
Look, I'm sure Sauter will do a fine job.

739
00:39:45,935 --> 00:39:48,540
Are you sure you'll have a use for this?

740
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,415
Dude, you're being kind of insensitive.

741
00:39:51,435 --> 00:39:52,690
She'll be fine.

742
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,176
Phone. It's the mayor.

743
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,760
Yes, sir?

744
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,770
Well, yes. But.

745
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:09,070
Of course. Yes, that's...

746
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,770
sir, you don't have to beg.

747
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:16,190
You are begging.

748
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,220
As of now?

749
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:20,950
Okay.

750
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,003
- I'm the new chief.
- Not interim?

751
00:40:30,045 --> 00:40:32,234
Don't you dare call me that again.

752
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:38,440
Oh, my god, what happened?
What did he say?

753
00:40:38,485 --> 00:40:41,617
- I honestly have no idea.
- I think I do.

754
00:40:42,421 --> 00:40:44,145
What's this?

755
00:40:44,165 --> 00:40:46,371
Bumped my arrest to page two.

756
00:40:48,882 --> 00:40:50,769
Congratulations, Karen.

757
00:40:50,789 --> 00:40:52,240
Thank you.

758
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,430
PHOTO: BRUTON GASTER

759
00:40:57,646 --> 00:40:59,841
- We should have a party!
- We should definitely have a party.

760
00:40:59,861 --> 00:41:03,632
- We have all the party accoutrements!
- Just go get some party gear

761
00:41:03,652 --> 00:41:06,720
and just open some crackers
and a bottle of something.

762
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:13,185
Shawn, are you sure you didn't get
some sort of special message this week?

763
00:41:13,205 --> 00:41:17,019
Dad, I told you, I dropped my phone.
Now, I gotta go.

764
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:20,205
No no, Shawn! Look, there's something I gotta
get off my chest before you leave here!

765
00:41:20,225 --> 00:41:23,924
Dad, I don't know if you just read the secret
or watched an emotional oprah or what.

766
00:41:23,955 --> 00:41:25,995
But I don't think we're ready to
open our souls to each other.

767
00:41:26,015 --> 00:41:28,444
- Well, we have no choice, kid.
- But we do, and it's good.

768
00:41:28,464 --> 00:41:31,305
Because what we have is simple
and shallow and unobtrusive.

769
00:41:31,325 --> 00:41:34,985
So let's have this conversation when
you're 90 and maybe on an oxygen tank.

770
00:41:35,005 --> 00:41:37,745
'Cause I have a date with
a woman who runs a Museum.

771
00:41:37,765 --> 00:41:39,501
- And that's new for me.
- No, Shawn!

772
00:41:39,521 --> 00:41:41,804
- Please, no!
- It just feels good.

773
00:41:41,824 --> 00:41:44,330
You know what, I'll grab
the door for you on my way out!

774
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,124
Mom.
