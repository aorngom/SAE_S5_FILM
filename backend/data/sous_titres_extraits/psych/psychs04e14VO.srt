1
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:16,390
- What are you doing?
- My book report.

2
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,851
Didn't you just start this book
a half an hour ago?

3
00:00:19,324 --> 00:00:22,258
Yeah, I read the flap
and then the first chapter,

4
00:00:22,383 --> 00:00:24,732
then I totally figured out the ending,
so it's cool.

5
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:28,693
- How do you know that you're right?
- You taught me how to draw conclusions.

6
00:00:29,232 --> 00:00:31,113
You know what you're doing,
don't you?

7
00:00:31,577 --> 00:00:33,658
Banking a whole afternoon
of video game time.

8
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:37,385
You're operating
on incomplete information. It's sloppy,

9
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,330
you're gonna find yourself
embarrassed by it.

10
00:00:39,669 --> 00:00:42,735
Dad, please, it's pretty obvious
to figure out what's gonna happen.

11
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,527
Wilbur's gonna win the pig ribbon,

12
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,360
and he and Charlotte
are gonna live happily ever after.

13
00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:50,735
All right,

14
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:52,860
I'll tell you what.

15
00:00:52,985 --> 00:00:55,023
If you get an "A" on that report,

16
00:00:55,564 --> 00:00:57,973
- I'm gonna take you to Disneyland.
- Sweet!

17
00:01:00,849 --> 00:01:02,006
Good luck, kiddo.

18
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,926
You were doing exactly
what I'm doing now

19
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,939
when you poisoned...

20
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:17,434
Mr. Camfini's pizza.

21
00:01:18,516 --> 00:01:20,204
Think about what you want
on this pizza.

22
00:01:20,556 --> 00:01:23,790
It's the last one you'll eat
before you go to prison... for murder.

23
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:30,548
I could also do a calzone.
It's the same basic principle, right?

24
00:01:31,243 --> 00:01:33,676
Where's the pineapple?
You guys don't have any pineapple?

25
00:01:34,243 --> 00:01:35,243
Dad?

26
00:01:35,872 --> 00:01:38,139
- You gotta stop.
- I've made a pizza before.

27
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:39,747
You've got the wrong guy.

28
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:42,183
He's the only one
who couldn't possibly have done this.

29
00:01:42,308 --> 00:01:44,685
- Didn't you ever read the case file?
- Yeah, I read th...

30
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,718
Went over the summary and part of...
I don't have time to read case files.

31
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:50,109
Medical alert bracelet.

32
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:52,250
- The guy can't handle nuts.
- What?

33
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,935
Shawn, the poison
was dissolved in peanut oil.

34
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,075
His hands would look like baseball mitts
if he even got near that poison.

35
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:00,889
What'd I tell you?

36
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:15,381
First of all, let me apologize
for this interruption of process.

37
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:18,888
I borrowed $5
from my father last week,

38
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:22,229
and he's decided that now
would be an appropriate time to collect.

39
00:02:22,354 --> 00:02:23,559
Here you go, pop.

40
00:02:23,728 --> 00:02:25,561
Here's your five clams.
Take it.

41
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,104
Buy your lotto tickets.

42
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:30,065
Waste it on false hopes,
easy dreams.

43
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,610
Meanwhile,
I will go back to doing what I do,

44
00:02:32,807 --> 00:02:34,661
which is working for a living.

45
00:02:34,786 --> 00:02:37,664
Speaking of working for a living,
how can you, sir,

46
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,117
stand there with a clean conscience,

47
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,724
while I accuse
an innocent young man of murder,

48
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:44,955
when it was in fact you...

49
00:02:46,015 --> 00:02:47,816
who poisoned Mr. Camfini's pizza?

50
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:48,876
You did this?

51
00:02:53,475 --> 00:02:54,298
Yes, I did.

52
00:02:55,138 --> 00:02:57,092
I've had this place for 25 years.

53
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,761
I wasn't gonna let anyone sell off
my place to some chain.

54
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,015
- This is a family business.
- I know.

55
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:04,454
I'm your nephew.

56
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:06,685
You were gonna let him take me?

57
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,412
You know what? My work here is done.
Jules, cuff him.

58
00:03:10,537 --> 00:03:12,737
Lassie, finish topping that pizza.

59
00:03:17,768 --> 00:03:19,646
I got here as fast as I could.
What did I miss?

60
00:03:19,771 --> 00:03:21,060
Just me nailin' that guy.

61
00:03:21,185 --> 00:03:23,084
What are you talking about?
I nailed the guy.

62
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:24,662
How can you rewrite history?

63
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,331
He wrote a term paper
on president Mitchell.

64
00:03:27,522 --> 00:03:30,131
The fact is,
I saved your ass in there once again.

65
00:03:30,256 --> 00:03:32,503
- It's not the first time.
- Name another.

66
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,840
Are you kidding? When don't you come
to me for last-minute guidance?

67
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,363
I'm in a slump.
Gimme a break.

68
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,736
I'll give you this one
on a technicality.

69
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:44,640
But all the other stuff you do,
does that fall under fatherly duties?

70
00:03:47,213 --> 00:03:49,314
Did that not sound like a thank you?

71
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,732
Hello. Walter Snowden.

72
00:03:50,857 --> 00:03:53,816
I'd like to introduce myself
and say very impressive work.

73
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,609
Thanks, Walt.
I'm Shawn Spencer.

74
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:57,965
- This is my partner...
- Burton Guster.

75
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,155
Or should I say Ghee Buttersnaps

76
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,909
or Lavender Gooms
or Clementine Wooliesocks, perhaps?

77
00:04:05,656 --> 00:04:07,905
- This guy really is a fan.
- A fan or a stalker.

78
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,041
Ghee Buttersnaps was said on a secure
military base with no one else around.

79
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,961
Let's just say I've been following
your work for quite a while now,

80
00:04:14,248 --> 00:04:16,693
and this last is very impressive.

81
00:04:16,969 --> 00:04:19,404
I thought you were going
to accuse that first gentleman.

82
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,719
Would have been
completely ridiculous.

83
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:27,641
I wouldn't say completely ridiculous.
He did have a douchey face.

84
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,078
I saw what you were up to.
You turned it around.

85
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:33,246
You created a false sense of security
for the real culprit,

86
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:35,911
and then you coerced
a confession out of him.

87
00:04:36,036 --> 00:04:37,474
I mean, that was just...

88
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,070
Brilliant.

89
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,948
Let's just say that I am amazing
and leave it at that.

90
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,491
I'd like to offer you a job.

91
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,787
Thank you, but no, thank you.
He already has a job.

92
00:04:48,976 --> 00:04:50,929
Now, this is for the both of you,
actually.

93
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,043
I run a fairly well-known
private security firm,

94
00:04:54,415 --> 00:04:57,880
and I'm working for a gentleman
who is quite... important.

95
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:01,634
Walt, our jobs require that we go
shirtless at any given moment,

96
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:04,548
and this, no offense,
sounds a little dry.

97
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,328
It's a two-week operation.
I'll offer you $8,500 a day.

98
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,477
- Do the math.
- Gus, do the math.

99
00:05:11,732 --> 00:05:13,081
That's a lot of money.

100
00:05:14,054 --> 00:05:15,798
What would we be doing exactly?

101
00:05:15,923 --> 00:05:18,358
You'd be part
of a prestigious think tank.

102
00:05:18,483 --> 00:05:21,278
- A think tank?
- A hand-picked assembly of experts,

103
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,907
who would be working with my client,
Mr. Ashton Bonaventure.

104
00:05:25,548 --> 00:05:27,701
- The billionaire businessman?
- That's fantastic.

105
00:05:27,987 --> 00:05:30,187
I love that guy.
I love his mane.

106
00:05:30,312 --> 00:05:31,997
He's looking for new product ideas.

107
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:33,582
No product ideas.

108
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,543
He will be after I pitch him
the concept for the electric sponge.

109
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,419
This has nothing to do
with businesses.

110
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,454
So what will we be doing?

111
00:05:41,113 --> 00:05:42,925
Preventing his assassination.

112
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,405
Psych 414
"Think Tank"

113
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,293
Timing: Psych Team
www.sous-titres.eu

114
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:12,172
The latest threat
on Mr. Bonaventure's life

115
00:06:12,297 --> 00:06:14,074
has been alarmingly precise.

116
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:17,599
It states he will not survive
his speech in Santa Barbara.

117
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,798
Any questions
before we get in the room?

118
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,641
When will Gus and I be riding
in Mr. Bonaventure's hot air balloon?

119
00:06:27,766 --> 00:06:30,388
I don't even see
where that is a part of your duties.

120
00:06:30,513 --> 00:06:31,345
I see.

121
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,439
Can I ride on the back of his jet ski
while he performs water doughnuts?

122
00:06:34,564 --> 00:06:37,033
I don't see
how that'll help protect him.

123
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:40,136
Will he at least leave the outgoing
message on my answering machine?

124
00:06:40,261 --> 00:06:44,250
I believe in doing whatever it takes
to stimulate the creative process,

125
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,145
within limits, and to that effect,

126
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:51,662
I have addressed all of the items
on your contract rider.

127
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:52,578
Rider?

128
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,998
We have people looking
for your regulation-size trampoline,

129
00:06:56,296 --> 00:06:58,609
the packs of Big League Chew,

130
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:02,796
and, of course, Mr. Guster's
official NBA "let's blast it" air horn.

131
00:07:02,975 --> 00:07:05,477
- I didn't want one of those.
- No, they'll find it.

132
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,355
This is where your work begins.

133
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,040
Now, the experts inside here
are the brightest minds in their fields.

134
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,354
The ideas
will be flying around fast.

135
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,895
Now we'll go over every attack
scenario imaginable.

136
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,554
Mr. Bonaventure's life
depends upon it.

137
00:07:21,223 --> 00:07:22,611
Hope you're ready.

138
00:07:26,623 --> 00:07:27,673
Oh, my God.

139
00:07:28,283 --> 00:07:30,783
- Look at all the Skittles!
- You ordered them, Mr. Spencer.

140
00:07:31,482 --> 00:07:34,828
I'd like to introduce you
to your fellow think tank members.

141
00:07:35,235 --> 00:07:37,394
This is Fred Collins Boyd,

142
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:40,000
who is a retired agent
for the secret service.

143
00:07:40,173 --> 00:07:42,123
He was hand-picked
by president Reagan.

144
00:07:42,422 --> 00:07:43,921
Reagan was the one after Mitchell?

145
00:07:44,236 --> 00:07:46,487
President Mitchell
was played by Kevin Kline in <i>Dave</i>.

146
00:07:46,612 --> 00:07:48,383
- He's a fictional character.
- No.

147
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,645
Dave was a fictional character
who looked like president Mitchell.

148
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,389
And Svetlana Progoyovic,

149
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,817
formerly an independent contractor
working with government agencies,

150
00:07:57,942 --> 00:07:59,186
including the K.G.B.

151
00:07:59,363 --> 00:08:03,273
She's now working for the American
government in a preventative capacity.

152
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:06,235
- Independent contractor. That mean...
- Hit woman? Yes.

153
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,445
- I shouldn't try...
- Don't even think about it.

154
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:12,407
And rounding out our team is Alan Zenuk,
who graduated from M.I.T.

155
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,576
And is now
a leading crime statistician,

156
00:08:15,109 --> 00:08:16,829
dealing with odds and probabilities.

157
00:08:17,305 --> 00:08:19,998
I see. But didn't Winnie
from <i>The Wonder Years</i> also do that,

158
00:08:20,327 --> 00:08:23,418
and wouldn't it have been way cooler
to have her instead?

159
00:08:23,746 --> 00:08:26,296
And I'd like to introduce you
to Shawn Spencer

160
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:30,342
and Burton Guster,
who started a psychic detective agency

161
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,762
four years ago and have since solved
an impressive number of cases

162
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,749
for the local police department.

163
00:08:35,874 --> 00:08:38,329
- Gentlemen, have a seat.
- All right.

164
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:42,980
And, of course, you all know by now
this is our client,

165
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,064
maverick billionaire,
Ashton Bonaventure.

166
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:50,111
He is an innovator on the cutting edge
of the technological industry.

167
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,574
That makes sense. I saw on Cribs that
he has a soda fountain in his bedroom.

168
00:08:54,532 --> 00:08:57,119
Yes, well, oddly enough,
that is correct as well.

169
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:00,965
He also turned Wall Street upside down
when he bought out Tetron Tech in '98.

170
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,626
- Thousands of people lost their jobs.
- Mr. Guster is on point, actually.

171
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,356
You do not do as well as he has done

172
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:10,678
without leaving a tidal wave of enemies
in your wake,

173
00:09:10,803 --> 00:09:13,926
and there have been three attempts
on his life in the last two years.

174
00:09:14,632 --> 00:09:17,931
It has become painfully apparent
that there are blind spots

175
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,725
in his security detail,

176
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,269
and it is your job
to tell us what they are.

177
00:09:22,445 --> 00:09:26,400
If a bad guy can do it, I want us
to have considered it beforehand.

178
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:28,650
- Any questions?
- Yes, I have a question

179
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:31,235
for the statistician formerly known
as Kenneth Branagh.

180
00:09:32,135 --> 00:09:34,906
Without looking, can you tell me exactly
how many Skittles are in this bowl?

181
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:37,367
Sorry.
And what is the probability

182
00:09:37,655 --> 00:09:39,786
that Gus will choose a green one?

183
00:09:40,638 --> 00:09:43,451
Excuse me. What brings
Mr. Bonaventure to Santa Barbara?

184
00:09:43,576 --> 00:09:45,292
The purpose of the visit

185
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,436
is the company's annual board
of directors address

186
00:09:47,561 --> 00:09:49,795
and to announce the rollout
of a major new product.

187
00:09:50,626 --> 00:09:54,134
Perhaps we should hear the rest
from Mr. Bonaventure himself.

188
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,888
<i>Hello, team.
Thank you for participating.</i>

189
00:09:58,828 --> 00:10:01,031
<i>I can't imagine what it's like</i>

190
00:10:01,156 --> 00:10:03,769
<i>to be in your shoes right now,
having your responsibilities.</i>

191
00:10:04,144 --> 00:10:07,210
<i>Just know
that I will do whatever I can</i>

192
00:10:07,335 --> 00:10:10,018
<i>to help you keep me alive out there,
all right?</i>

193
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,653
We're here to serve you, sir,
so relax.

194
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:14,696
- We're on top of it.
- Mr. Bonaventure?

195
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,844
Spencer... Shawn Spencer here.

196
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:20,869
Do you think that there is a market
for a comb that works while you sleep?

197
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,540
You have to push the button to talk.

198
00:10:27,254 --> 00:10:30,170
- Can you...
- No. I'm not gonna ask him again.

199
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,299
He went scrooge on me.
Did you hear that?

200
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,512
If there's nothing more,
let's get to work.

201
00:10:43,106 --> 00:10:46,103
This is a schematic of the building
where we think the attacker will strike.

202
00:10:47,144 --> 00:10:50,471
I'm lookin' at the service entrance
to the lower kitchen of the hotel here.

203
00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:51,699
It is off-limits.

204
00:10:51,824 --> 00:10:54,444
You cannot control a working environment
with that many moving pieces.

205
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,030
I agree. Most breaches
would occur in that kitchen.

206
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:00,575
The only tactic here is to make
the security team look the other way.

207
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,202
Give me that map. I'll show you.

208
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:04,079
We're not participating.

209
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:06,221
They might
as well be speaking Australian.

210
00:11:06,346 --> 00:11:08,886
Now, look, it's like part giraffe,
part Loch Ness monster.

211
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,308
Say something.

212
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:17,125
I'm having a vision.

213
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:18,635
Mr. Snowden.

214
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,680
You still care for her very deeply,
don't you?

215
00:11:22,536 --> 00:11:23,557
That's correct.

216
00:11:27,738 --> 00:11:28,895
Svetlana?

217
00:11:29,475 --> 00:11:31,974
You recently moved
into a new residence, did you not?

218
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:33,665
Congratulations.
Very sexy.

219
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,368
Lava lamps, yes?

220
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:39,484
- What does that have to do with that?
- I'm not sure yet, Boyd.

221
00:11:39,609 --> 00:11:40,866
That is how my gift works.

222
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,618
It's like acid reflux,
but instead of acid,

223
00:11:43,884 --> 00:11:46,518
it's psychic-ness.
It's psychic-ness reflux.

224
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,750
- I'll tell you when you're gonna die.
- Thanks for the parlor tricks, but no.

225
00:11:50,441 --> 00:11:54,087
If you don't mind, we're trying
to figure out what we're supposed to do

226
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,247
if bullets fly in this tight kitchen
proximity here,

227
00:11:57,372 --> 00:11:59,216
so if you don't have
anything on topic.

228
00:11:59,341 --> 00:12:00,302
<i>Under Siege.</i>

229
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,262
Seagal used a spatula
to deflect bullets.

230
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,472
So you're saying
we arm our people with spatulas?

231
00:12:04,642 --> 00:12:07,767
No, I'm saying it was pretty cool,
and he's <i>Above the Law</i> again.

232
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,480
I calculate the probability of that
occurring to be 0.0%.

233
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:17,420
Let's switch to explosives
as a present threat.

234
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,447
I've seen tiny plastique explosives
in cell phones.

235
00:12:21,018 --> 00:12:22,449
How crude and inaccurate.

236
00:12:22,706 --> 00:12:25,393
Getting the phone to the target
is difficult enough.

237
00:12:25,518 --> 00:12:27,788
Getting them to use it
is not predictable.

238
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,581
And how do you target your mark?

239
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,624
Personally,
I'm quite fond of poisons.

240
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:35,377
A cell phone isn't predictable enough,
but a poison is perfectly reliable.

241
00:12:35,502 --> 00:12:37,506
- Is that what you're saying?
- I use skin contact.

242
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,112
I spray it directly on them.

243
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:42,305
It's as if I sneezed, and then it's...
How do you say?

244
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,512
Good night, Charlie.

245
00:12:43,711 --> 00:12:46,014
Gus, how bad do you wish
you were Charlie?

246
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,141
She's a killer, Shawn.
She kills people.

247
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,259
- But how bad?
- Really bad.

248
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:54,064
- And how do you get close?
- The easy answer is any uniform.

249
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:57,984
An assassin is 40% more likely
to be disguised as a service person.

250
00:12:59,142 --> 00:13:00,501
Whenever I consult,

251
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:03,984
I always suggest that we immediately
focus in on delivery personnel.

252
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,869
The public are conditioned to find
uniformed persons as less suspicious.

253
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,849
When I had to walk through a crowd,

254
00:13:09,974 --> 00:13:13,208
I'd always try to appear
as femine and disarming as possible.

255
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,085
You wore a bikini
made of whipped cream?

256
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:17,629
I carry a baby.

257
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,955
A plastic one, of course.

258
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,177
I was born
without a maternal instinct.

259
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,347
The larger question is

260
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,392
what gaps are there in the security
system that we can't account for?

261
00:13:31,122 --> 00:13:33,270
There are always gaps.
You can't account for everything.

262
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,272
We can. We have to.

263
00:13:37,575 --> 00:13:40,067
Let's take a ten-minute break.

264
00:13:40,192 --> 00:13:44,156
I have to have a conference call
with Mr. Bonaventure's advance team.

265
00:13:45,631 --> 00:13:47,238
- Can I talk to you?
- Certainly.

266
00:13:47,363 --> 00:13:48,618
- Excuse me.
- Excuse us.

267
00:13:48,743 --> 00:13:50,018
We'll be right back.

268
00:13:51,601 --> 00:13:53,598
Keep your eyes off my draft, Boyd.

269
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:55,447
Follow me.

270
00:13:55,572 --> 00:13:57,464
Please tell me
that the trampoline has arrived.

271
00:13:57,589 --> 00:13:59,493
- It's not the trampoline.
- What is it?

272
00:13:59,618 --> 00:14:01,418
Time is of the "es-sance."

273
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:05,635
Yes, sir.

274
00:14:06,088 --> 00:14:08,346
Yes, sir, I understand.
We'll let 'em know right away, sir.

275
00:14:08,843 --> 00:14:10,156
Over here, Shawn.

276
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,102
Dude, this is kind of exciting.
What's behind there?

277
00:14:15,543 --> 00:14:17,031
- That says "exit".
- I know.

278
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,441
We are completely making fools
of ourselves inside there.

279
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,400
We need to cut our losses
and go home.

280
00:14:21,784 --> 00:14:23,410
This slump of yours
is out of control.

281
00:14:23,535 --> 00:14:25,555
I admit we're having
some early trouble,

282
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,037
but that room is
like kryptonite to my skills.

283
00:14:28,162 --> 00:14:31,369
It's, like, neutralizing my weapons.
I need to see thingsand touch stuff.

284
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,814
Has it ever occurred to you
that these are the kind of people

285
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:36,351
that could figure out
you're not who you say you are?

286
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,835
- Come on, son.
- Do not do Ed Lover on me.

287
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,505
We need to wow them with ideas
and we're right back in business.

288
00:14:41,674 --> 00:14:43,548
Or completely out of business.

289
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,844
If we're gonna stay here,
you need to call your dad.

290
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,014
- Since when do I need his help?
- You called him to get here.

291
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:52,724
Which we didn't use.

292
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,318
I may not be a planner,
or a detail man,

293
00:14:56,443 --> 00:14:59,764
or a taxpayer,
but when push comes to shove, I work,

294
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,690
- and I get the job done.
- My gosh.

295
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,466
Now follow me back in there,
and let's blow these guys' minds,

296
00:15:04,591 --> 00:15:05,841
scanners-style.

297
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:12,593
We chose this hotel specifically because
none of the surrounding buildings

298
00:15:12,718 --> 00:15:14,545
are higher than two stories,

299
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,716
so if we surround him
with all six bodyguards,

300
00:15:17,841 --> 00:15:21,586
then we have seemingly eliminated
all possibilities of an attack.

301
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,047
- So what are we missing?
- Here comes the wow.

302
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:28,333
- Yes, Mr. Spencer, you have something?
- As a matter of fact, I do, Walt.

303
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:31,555
If the assassin is unable
to take a shot from above,

304
00:15:31,742 --> 00:15:34,407
then I think there is a very,
very good possibility

305
00:15:34,532 --> 00:15:36,268
that he will shoot from beneath.

306
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,585
- From beneath?
- Indeed. Shoot from beneath.

307
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,621
So, what are you saying,
the killer's like a groundhog,

308
00:15:42,746 --> 00:15:45,443
who digs little tunnels in the earth,
something like that?

309
00:15:46,087 --> 00:15:49,531
- What are you calculating, Alan?
- The odds of Mr. Spencer getting fired.

310
00:15:49,776 --> 00:15:50,651
What?

311
00:15:50,776 --> 00:15:54,243
I think that's about enough for today.
Let's meet tomorrow, 8:00 sharp.

312
00:15:55,284 --> 00:15:57,087
I was just gettin' warmed up, man.

313
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:07,344
It's really scraping the bottom
of the barrel, asking Lassie for help.

314
00:16:07,469 --> 00:16:10,113
Your ability to know nothing
about real police work

315
00:16:10,238 --> 00:16:12,035
has finally caught up to you.

316
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,236
- We can always just...
- We're not calling my dad.

317
00:16:14,361 --> 00:16:16,061
I can do this by myself.

318
00:16:17,014 --> 00:16:18,864
Exactly how does that work?

319
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:21,722
- Whatever do you mean, chief?
- With your father.

320
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,722
See, I saw him at the pizza place.

321
00:16:23,847 --> 00:16:24,997
You sure did.

322
00:16:25,299 --> 00:16:28,549
You see, he missed most
of my baseball games as a kid,

323
00:16:28,695 --> 00:16:32,699
and recently, he has been trying
to show me more support in my ventures.

324
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:42,286
This is big boy work,
so what do you want?

325
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:45,045
Quick question, more of a trivia thing.
Kind of a "what if".

326
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:47,063
- Get to it.
- Have you ever given any thought

327
00:16:47,188 --> 00:16:49,702
to how or when someone would try
to assassinate Ashton Bonaventure?

328
00:16:49,827 --> 00:16:52,594
Don't spout out everything Tom Cruise
did in <i>Valkyrie</i>, I already pitched that.

329
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:53,934
Bonaventure?

330
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:57,691
- You're working for Bonaventure?
- Us and some other experts.

331
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,822
I've been trying
since forever to get

332
00:16:59,947 --> 00:17:01,982
on one of these private
security details.

333
00:17:02,107 --> 00:17:05,357
I wrote to Gerald Ford when I was a kid,
telling him I wanted to protect him,

334
00:17:06,061 --> 00:17:07,409
and that I loved him.

335
00:17:07,534 --> 00:17:10,528
This might be your lucky day,
'cause I'm thinking of letting you in.

336
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,696
- Throwing you a bone.
- I'm not going to help you.

337
00:17:12,821 --> 00:17:15,075
If they wanted my ideas
they could have asked me themselves.

338
00:17:15,297 --> 00:17:17,797
Gus has 100 large in his pocket.

339
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,454
Are you trying to bribe me?

340
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:22,290
Fair enough. You drive a hard bargain.
And 3 bucks for a baby nugget?

341
00:17:22,802 --> 00:17:25,251
This is ridiculous! I know everything
there is about Bonaventure.

342
00:17:25,484 --> 00:17:28,423
I've been dealing with his people
for weeks, coordinating crowd control.

343
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,748
I would have been a real asset
in that room.

344
00:17:31,111 --> 00:17:32,717
I'm gonna call Bill McGoldrick.

345
00:17:33,924 --> 00:17:36,471
- Who?
- He's head of security. He hate me.

346
00:17:36,673 --> 00:17:39,265
I don't know him.
We've been dealing with Walter Snowden.

347
00:17:39,675 --> 00:17:41,301
- Who's that?
- Walter Snowden?

348
00:17:41,426 --> 00:17:44,145
- Head of Snowden security?
- I've never heard of Snowden security.

349
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:45,688
You don't know Walter Snowden?

350
00:17:46,054 --> 00:17:49,904
I've never heard of Walter Snowden
or Snowden security in my life.

351
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:51,804
Who is he?

352
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:58,367
<i>Perhaps we should hear the rest
from Mr. Bonaventure himself.</i>

353
00:17:59,806 --> 00:18:00,786
<i>Just know...</i>

354
00:18:02,432 --> 00:18:04,596
He's the head of Bonaventure...

355
00:18:05,433 --> 00:18:07,739
Head of think tank operations.

356
00:18:09,182 --> 00:18:10,182
Crap.

357
00:18:17,213 --> 00:18:18,213
Crap.

358
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:22,120
Now I gotta get a warrant
to get in this place.

359
00:18:31,915 --> 00:18:33,064
What the hell?

360
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:43,915
Damn.

361
00:18:45,873 --> 00:18:46,873
Skittles?

362
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,697
Bonaventure
has never heard of Snowden.

363
00:18:49,822 --> 00:18:51,209
I don't get it.

364
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,840
We saw him on video.

365
00:18:55,155 --> 00:18:56,676
- Video was fake, Gus.
- Fake?

366
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,596
<i>Hello, team.
Thank you for participating.</i>

367
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,556
It was footage of Bonaventure

368
00:19:01,727 --> 00:19:04,058
at a golf tournament
or sales convention or something.

369
00:19:04,468 --> 00:19:06,344
No, should have known better.

370
00:19:06,469 --> 00:19:08,521
He would have loved
my pillow comb idea.

371
00:19:09,595 --> 00:19:11,246
Snowden tried to kill him
in the past,

372
00:19:11,371 --> 00:19:13,359
but he could never crack
Bonaventure's security.

373
00:19:13,838 --> 00:19:17,196
<i>If a bad guy can do it, I want us
to have considered it beforehand.</i>

374
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:21,223
He puts together this think tank
to gather as many ideas as possible

375
00:19:21,348 --> 00:19:23,202
so that he can carry out the hit
successfully.

376
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,039
There's no record
of a Walter Snowden in our database.

377
00:19:26,474 --> 00:19:28,805
- What about the others?
- Boyd, Progoyovic, and Zenuk

378
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,788
all check out.
We will question them.

379
00:19:30,913 --> 00:19:33,367
So let me get this straight.
You joined this organization,

380
00:19:33,492 --> 00:19:35,256
didn't bother to check
if they were legit,

381
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,977
and then you gave 'em ideas
about how to kill one of your idols?

382
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,260
If it's any consolation,
all of his ideas stank.

383
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,473
- Stunk.
- Stank.

384
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:43,097
- Stinkeded?
- I'm sure they did.

385
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,635
I won't say that I'm not gonna hold this
over your head forever,

386
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,393
because, honestly, of course I am.

387
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,853
It's not the time to gloat 'cause you're
right for the first time in your life.

388
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,417
I'm just having a mini slump.

389
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:55,860
The important thing is, I need evidence
bags for the rest of those Skittles.

390
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,363
We have four days to find this guy.

391
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:01,199
- Why four days?
- That's when Bonaventure gets to town.

392
00:20:01,754 --> 00:20:03,535
Bonaventure's flight got
in four hours ago.

393
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:06,634
- He's already at his hotel.
- Hopefully alive.

394
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,483
What is the meaning
of this interruption?

395
00:20:14,431 --> 00:20:16,719
I believe
that you will be in grave danger,

396
00:20:16,844 --> 00:20:19,968
and believe that there will be
an attempt made on your life.

397
00:20:20,611 --> 00:20:23,137
- And how do you know that?
- Because I am a psychic.

398
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:24,538
I'm also...

399
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,934
An inventor. It's a pillow that combs
your hair while you sleep.

400
00:20:28,611 --> 00:20:29,561
Check it out.

401
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,772
You need to cancel your speech tonight,
and we need to get you out of town.

402
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,233
No, this is the most important
appearance of the year for me.

403
00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:39,153
12 other companies are trying
to launch what I'm going to announce.

404
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:41,322
If we don't go first,
we're finished.

405
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,866
Five years of development.
I'm going on.

406
00:20:44,303 --> 00:20:45,618
My company depends on it.

407
00:20:45,806 --> 00:20:47,555
No, sir, your attackers
depend on it.

408
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:50,665
I pay these people
very well to keep me safe,

409
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,585
and nothing in this world is gonna
stop me from making that speech.

410
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,215
Right now, you're not safe,

411
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,936
and this guy, who has solved
over 50 unsolvable cases,

412
00:20:58,061 --> 00:20:59,495
is your best chance to live.

413
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,176
- And why is that?
- Because solving these unsolvable cases

414
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,680
is usually impressive to people,
and because I spent the last 12 hours

415
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,491
with your would-be assassin,

416
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,560
and I know every single little thing
that he might try.

417
00:21:13,311 --> 00:21:15,661
All right, psychic,
here's your shot.

418
00:21:16,313 --> 00:21:17,734
I'm going to my car.

419
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,012
Get me there.

420
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,994
<i>I've even seen tiny plastique explosives
in cell phones.</i>

421
00:21:32,317 --> 00:21:34,065
Don't answer that.
That stays where it is.

422
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,186
In fact, everybody, cell phones out.
Let's see 'em.

423
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:38,061
Now put 'em on the floor.

424
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:40,682
Let's move.

425
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,975
<i>Generally people are programmed to find
persons in uniform less suspicious.</i>

426
00:21:51,871 --> 00:21:52,685
The maid.

427
00:21:53,071 --> 00:21:54,071
The maid!

428
00:22:03,065 --> 00:22:03,988
Axe for men?

429
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,264
What?

430
00:22:06,015 --> 00:22:07,115
She's clean.

431
00:22:14,478 --> 00:22:16,149
<i>Me? I carry a baby.</i>

432
00:22:16,827 --> 00:22:17,827
Baby.

433
00:22:17,952 --> 00:22:19,826
- The baby?
- The baby!

434
00:22:23,783 --> 00:22:25,533
Baby's real. She's clean.

435
00:22:27,577 --> 00:22:28,888
<i>I use skin contact.</i>

436
00:22:34,072 --> 00:22:36,312
Feel it, orchid man!
Nice try!

437
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,855
It's water. He's clean.

438
00:22:38,943 --> 00:22:39,816
He's clean.

439
00:22:49,063 --> 00:22:52,453
I think we can all agree
that that was a horrible mistake.

440
00:22:53,149 --> 00:22:55,449
Good job tackling that maid, though.

441
00:22:56,399 --> 00:22:59,544
I think the only thing to come out
of this exercise will be lawsuits.

442
00:23:00,335 --> 00:23:01,785
I'd call my lawyer,

443
00:23:02,186 --> 00:23:04,465
but I seem to have dropped my phone.

444
00:23:06,022 --> 00:23:07,022
Wait!

445
00:23:15,078 --> 00:23:16,428
Hair looks great.

446
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:22,591
Chief, I really don't see the point
in getting upset over spilled milk.

447
00:23:22,716 --> 00:23:23,937
Why would I be upset?

448
00:23:24,062 --> 00:23:25,939
The most powerful businessman
in the state

449
00:23:26,064 --> 00:23:28,844
is the target of an assassination,
and one of my people helped plan it.

450
00:23:28,969 --> 00:23:31,528
- It was two. Gus was there as well.
- Why would you say that?

451
00:23:31,653 --> 00:23:33,866
It might help cushion the blow
if we distribute the blame.

452
00:23:33,991 --> 00:23:35,863
- Cushion who?
- I guess me mostly.

453
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:38,525
Chief,
the man that we are looking for

454
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,589
is operating
under the alias of "Walter Snowden".

455
00:23:40,714 --> 00:23:42,810
The remaining members
of the bogus think tank

456
00:23:42,935 --> 00:23:45,423
have given us a detailed description
of his features.

457
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:48,292
He is obviously well-funded
and deeply connected.

458
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:49,510
Here's the sketch.

459
00:23:50,849 --> 00:23:52,646
- May I?
- Certainly.

460
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:56,934
Just a moment.
I know this man.

461
00:23:57,537 --> 00:24:00,646
- Do you know from where?
- Court. Some sort of lawsuit.

462
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:03,357
- What kind of suit?
- I believe it was wrongful death,

463
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,026
something in one of our factories.

464
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:07,588
<i>You still care for her very deeply,
don't you?</i>

465
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:08,780
<i>That's correct.</i>

466
00:24:09,164 --> 00:24:10,464
It was his wife.

467
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:14,368
Yes, I believe it was.
As I recall, we settled.

468
00:24:14,665 --> 00:24:16,036
And you don't know his name?

469
00:24:16,478 --> 00:24:19,207
I spend a lot of time in court.
It's the nature of my position.

470
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,291
All right.

471
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,877
O'Hara, let's get on anybody who may
have had any court battles

472
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:24,668
with Mr. Bonaventure's company.

473
00:24:24,793 --> 00:24:26,714
And, Mr. Bonaventure,
I cannot express

474
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,045
with words
the horror of these developments.

475
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,552
Members of our consulting team
being involved is a shock,

476
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,458
and this will be dealt
with for the future.

477
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:36,325
You obviously have
our full cooperation.

478
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,726
If you insist on keeping
your public appearance this evening,

479
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,978
we will provide
a full security detail.

480
00:24:41,316 --> 00:24:44,398
Actually, this man is the only one
who successfully protected me this week.

481
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:46,737
- He saved my life.
- He also put your life in danger.

482
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:48,861
- Why would you say that?
- Turnabout.

483
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,321
So as I understand it,

484
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,031
the suspect offered
all of you $8,500 a day,

485
00:24:53,156 --> 00:24:55,159
with the exception of Mr. Boyd
who received 9,500.

486
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:58,704
- How come you got more?
- Yeah. He tells the future.

487
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,040
All you've told us
is the plot to <i>Die Hard 3</i>.

488
00:25:01,364 --> 00:25:03,292
Yeah, and that isn't difficult
to ascertain?

489
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:05,586
Calm down.
Maybe it was 8,500.

490
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:07,296
It wasn't about the money.

491
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:09,715
Let it go, gentlemen.
The check didn't even clear.

492
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:12,555
This is a total disaster.
Now we got nothin'.

493
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,365
That's not entirely true.
We got this dope NBA air horn.

494
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:19,433
Stop screwing around!

495
00:25:20,429 --> 00:25:22,517
I will be running point on this,
ladies and gentlemen.

496
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:25,565
Actually, I want Mr. Spencer
to work point...

497
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:26,607
With my team.

498
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:29,736
Feel that!

499
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:32,339
That is a very bad decision.

500
00:25:32,744 --> 00:25:34,532
I don't make bad decisions,

501
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,743
and your participation
is entirely my call.

502
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,912
Mr. Spencer is my choice.

503
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,709
- Well what, Lassie?
- What do you want to do?

504
00:25:48,411 --> 00:25:51,674
- This was way more fun a moment ago.
- In other words, you have no idea.

505
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:54,335
Of course, I have an idea.
What we're going to do...

506
00:25:58,065 --> 00:26:00,000
is reassemble the think tank.

507
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,650
All right, first of all,
let me just say that this is very,

508
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,585
very exciting for me.

509
00:26:11,828 --> 00:26:15,818
I like to do things differently,
so no one will call me Mr. Spencer.

510
00:26:16,081 --> 00:26:17,131
It's Shawn.

511
00:26:17,584 --> 00:26:19,883
Shawny
if you're feeling a little loose.

512
00:26:20,462 --> 00:26:22,807
Never the Shawn dog,
'cause that's just lame,

513
00:26:22,932 --> 00:26:25,209
and I've never been one
to chase balls.

514
00:26:25,647 --> 00:26:27,596
We will check our egos at the door,

515
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:31,150
along with our watches, because time
does not exist in this room.

516
00:26:31,982 --> 00:26:34,258
So let's see 'em.
Watches down.

517
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:36,919
Come on. Take 'em off.

518
00:26:37,213 --> 00:26:39,342
Means you, too, Stoltz.
Let's do it.

519
00:26:39,838 --> 00:26:40,680
Very nice.

520
00:26:41,152 --> 00:26:42,152
I like it.

521
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:44,141
Now, what do we know?

522
00:26:44,525 --> 00:26:46,425
Bonaventure will not budge
on his plans.

523
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,970
We also know
that the killer is very determined.

524
00:26:49,095 --> 00:26:51,541
Bonny boom-boom's gonna take
the stage for his shareholders speech

525
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:53,966
at exactly 7:20 p.m.
That gives us...

526
00:26:58,656 --> 00:26:59,845
Watches on.

527
00:27:01,343 --> 00:27:02,161
No, wait.

528
00:27:02,469 --> 00:27:04,844
I can just...
make out the clock from here.

529
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,458
Is it 3:00? Is it 2:00?
Is that a clock?

530
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,652
You know what?
Forget it.

531
00:27:13,597 --> 00:27:16,387
- Let's open things up to the room.
- Finally.

532
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:20,096
I could see two clear weaknesses,
here and here.

533
00:27:20,346 --> 00:27:23,599
Three. Now open up your earlobes.
I will elaborate.

534
00:27:24,037 --> 00:27:27,937
Number one, location
and its susceptibility to penetration.

535
00:27:30,223 --> 00:27:31,607
She... you...

536
00:27:33,165 --> 00:27:35,069
Erect structures must

537
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:37,603
defend external forces,
not only physically,

538
00:27:37,728 --> 00:27:39,102
but also psychologically.

539
00:27:39,332 --> 00:27:41,041
We need to think outside of the box.

540
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:43,102
What is this? Anybody?

541
00:27:43,227 --> 00:27:44,745
- A low-fat muffin?
- No!

542
00:27:45,291 --> 00:27:48,791
The speech will be given here
in the empire ballroom.

543
00:27:49,416 --> 00:27:52,545
We will keep a secure holding area
that is connected solely

544
00:27:52,955 --> 00:27:55,131
by this service corridor.

545
00:27:55,357 --> 00:27:57,682
I sense that once
he is on the pedestal,

546
00:27:58,168 --> 00:27:59,818
this area will be safe.

547
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,098
Question, big bear?

548
00:28:05,804 --> 00:28:06,934
Stop callin' me that.

549
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,388
I'll have to come up
with a new code name.

550
00:28:09,513 --> 00:28:11,397
Little bear certainly
isn't gonna do the trick.

551
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:14,317
You're wastin' all these uniforms
against this back wall.

552
00:28:14,488 --> 00:28:17,688
You leave the points of access,
the doors, the wings, more open.

553
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:20,425
See, this wall acts as your barrier.

554
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,033
Gotta make these cops more useful.

555
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,633
They will be more useful.

556
00:28:23,758 --> 00:28:26,345
I'm gonna have them thinking of Xmas
present ideas while they wait,

557
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:29,063
and gift certificates
will not be considered.

558
00:28:30,613 --> 00:28:32,179
Okay then, it's settled.

559
00:28:32,304 --> 00:28:35,296
We will put our defenses here
in the front.

560
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:37,317
Chief, this is just stupid.

561
00:28:37,635 --> 00:28:39,842
He doesn't let the senior ranking member
on this force?

562
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:41,702
You've got your team, he's got his.

563
00:28:41,827 --> 00:28:44,847
We put him into this position.
It's our job to get him out.

564
00:28:45,367 --> 00:28:46,367
Chief?

565
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:48,851
We have a plan.

566
00:29:03,204 --> 00:29:04,962
Stand by the door?
That's ridiculous.

567
00:29:05,087 --> 00:29:06,938
I'm essentially a security guard
in your plan.

568
00:29:07,063 --> 00:29:09,173
Are you kidding me?
You are Kevin Costner in this plan.

569
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:10,986
You're in charge
of the entire audience.

570
00:29:11,111 --> 00:29:13,480
- I should be with Bonaventure.
- I brought that up.

571
00:29:13,605 --> 00:29:15,213
He finds you unsettling.

572
00:29:15,338 --> 00:29:16,466
He mentioned me?

573
00:29:16,591 --> 00:29:19,527
Yes. He also said you were creepy,
but he did mention you.

574
00:29:19,652 --> 00:29:21,592
- By name?
- He called you "Lazenby".

575
00:29:21,717 --> 00:29:24,123
Come on, Carlton, we're fine.
It's not about who gets what title.

576
00:29:24,248 --> 00:29:26,438
- The man's life is at stake.
- What else isn't important?

577
00:29:26,563 --> 00:29:29,127
That fact that I'm adding
a surprise element the second

578
00:29:29,252 --> 00:29:31,365
- that I open this door.
- Wait a minute.

579
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,021
- What surprise element?
- Pardon me?

580
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,357
What do you mean, surprise element?

581
00:29:38,313 --> 00:29:41,032
We have been playing
from behind this whole time.

582
00:29:41,157 --> 00:29:43,349
It is now that I will use this!

583
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,958
- Your finger?
- My gift.

584
00:29:47,541 --> 00:29:50,996
Someone knew your route too well.
There's a mole on your own team.

585
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:53,165
My people have been with me
for ten years.

586
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,881
They should be used to the unexpected.

587
00:29:55,101 --> 00:29:57,294
- What are you doing?
- We're going on the offensive.

588
00:29:57,912 --> 00:30:00,789
You are set to take the stage at 7:20.
That means that...

589
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:02,350
Dadgummit.

590
00:30:02,475 --> 00:30:04,510
You have a watch on,
'cause I forgot to put...

591
00:30:05,976 --> 00:30:08,681
Oh, chop chop, gentlemen.
I'm on in five minutes.

592
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:09,726
Not...

593
00:30:10,916 --> 00:30:11,916
exactly.

594
00:30:13,088 --> 00:30:13,811
What?

595
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,088
The only thing
in the entire universe

596
00:30:16,213 --> 00:30:19,400
that your attacker knows is that
you will take the podium at 7:20 p.m.

597
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:22,903
He will have to be in position,
he will be at his most vulnerable,

598
00:30:23,089 --> 00:30:26,365
a veritable sitting duck
if we can find him, and I...

599
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,960
will find him.

600
00:30:30,544 --> 00:30:32,114
I will be able to sense him,

601
00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:35,166
and I will most likely
be able to see him.

602
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:37,710
And how will you do that?

603
00:30:38,048 --> 00:30:39,587
I will go on first, sir.

604
00:30:41,922 --> 00:30:43,606
What, on? Where?

605
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,927
The podium.
I will stall for as long as it takes,

606
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,096
sensing the crowd, smelling them,

607
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:51,765
anything out of place,
then the cops and your team,

608
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,976
will suss him out,
and you will follow.

609
00:30:54,862 --> 00:30:56,854
No, that is not acceptable.

610
00:30:59,192 --> 00:31:02,109
- Hand to the head, not working.
- That's why I added sound effects.

611
00:31:03,603 --> 00:31:06,530
Mr. Bonaventure,
I know how this is going to end,

612
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,158
and I am the only one
that can offer you that guarantee.

613
00:31:09,525 --> 00:31:12,741
- Have I been wrong yet?
- The maid, the gardener, the baby.

614
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:15,094
- Why would you say that?
- I don't know. Symmetry?

615
00:31:15,219 --> 00:31:17,241
Regardless,
I've gotten you this far.

616
00:31:17,366 --> 00:31:20,961
Now what do you value more, your life
or a slight delay in your speech?

617
00:31:29,569 --> 00:31:31,365
Shareholders, board members,

618
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,054
members of the press,

619
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,203
attractive businesswomen

620
00:31:35,328 --> 00:31:37,936
with your spiky heels
and your ankle tattoos.

621
00:31:39,954 --> 00:31:43,317
Raise your hand if you vacuum topless
to Carly Simon. I'm kidding.

622
00:31:45,932 --> 00:31:48,268
Welcome.
Welcome, all of you.

623
00:31:48,393 --> 00:31:51,905
My name is Shawn,
and I am the opening act, Jack!

624
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,163
I apologize in advance

625
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,431
if I completely blow your minds.

626
00:32:01,207 --> 00:32:02,311
There's a man...

627
00:32:05,384 --> 00:32:06,484
False alarm.

628
00:32:08,007 --> 00:32:09,457
I am here to say...

629
00:32:10,861 --> 00:32:12,008
that greed...

630
00:32:12,801 --> 00:32:14,601
for lack of a better word,

631
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:15,641
is good.

632
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,184
It's right.

633
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:18,894
<i>Greed works.</i>

634
00:32:19,151 --> 00:32:21,563
<i>Greed for life, for money, for love,</i>

635
00:32:22,085 --> 00:32:23,148
for flan.

636
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,534
<i>What is synergy?</i>

637
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,530
What is he doing?

638
00:32:29,861 --> 00:32:32,366
I really have no idea,
but you have to give him a chance.

639
00:32:33,308 --> 00:32:34,076
I think.

640
00:32:34,271 --> 00:32:35,271
Maybe.

641
00:32:37,053 --> 00:32:38,455
What the hell is he doing?

642
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:41,458
- I'm trying to find out.
- <i>I'm gonna get you guys an eyeball,</i>

643
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,126
so would you just
calm your asses down?

644
00:32:46,421 --> 00:32:48,770
About stock splits?

645
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,886
Because we're just gonna keep
splitting stocks, people,

646
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,471
and if the stock don't split,

647
00:32:55,078 --> 00:32:56,378
you must acquit.

648
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:06,567
Excuse me.

649
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,612
<i>I'm getting a vibe.
Check the air vents.</i>

650
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,280
Stay up there, Shawn.
Give us a minute.

651
00:33:17,904 --> 00:33:19,371
Let's talk about the future.

652
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:32,300
The true tragedy
is that we are a part

653
00:33:32,425 --> 00:33:34,641
of the most technologically
advanced company

654
00:33:34,766 --> 00:33:36,014
in all of California,

655
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:39,266
and yet, I walked
up onto this stage,

656
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,645
when we all know,
I should have flown

657
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:44,563
via jet pack.

658
00:33:44,947 --> 00:33:46,023
Who's with me?

659
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:51,862
Are my shoes electric? No.

660
00:33:52,186 --> 00:33:54,090
Does my pillow comb my hair at night

661
00:33:54,215 --> 00:33:55,699
while I am sleeping?

662
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,817
No! Sadly, it does not.

663
00:33:57,942 --> 00:33:59,161
And where, I ask you,

664
00:33:59,531 --> 00:34:00,983
is the hoverboard technology

665
00:34:01,108 --> 00:34:03,290
that we all saw
in <i>Back to the Future II</i>

666
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,332
over 20 years ago?

667
00:34:05,457 --> 00:34:07,211
How come that hasn't materialized?

668
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,159
We will be allocating

669
00:34:09,284 --> 00:34:12,358
a significant amount of our resources
to making that happen.

670
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:20,057
- Don't move! Drop the gun!
- Hands in the air!

671
00:34:20,539 --> 00:34:21,539
Now!

672
00:34:22,858 --> 00:34:25,716
And that's not even counting
the treadmill that we all saw

673
00:34:25,841 --> 00:34:29,491
so beautifully realized in the opening
credits of the Jetsons.

674
00:34:31,888 --> 00:34:34,388
- We got him.
- What? What do you mean?

675
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:37,272
We got him?
We "got him" got him?

676
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:41,662
- Get me out there.
- Bonny boom-boom is on the move.

677
00:34:41,943 --> 00:34:44,068
And I think it's about time
we had weapons

678
00:34:44,193 --> 00:34:46,417
that were designed to kill zombies!

679
00:34:48,832 --> 00:34:52,836
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
We are not doing hovercrafts, all right?

680
00:34:53,605 --> 00:34:56,282
And greed and flan are also a no-no.

681
00:34:56,899 --> 00:34:57,678
Now then.

682
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,766
Picked him up like a U.P.S. man,
I don't think he was going duck hunting.

683
00:35:04,147 --> 00:35:05,996
You blew it
when you chose a psychic.

684
00:35:06,121 --> 00:35:08,731
Didn't you know I would peg you?
That's a thing. Pegging people?

685
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:13,017
Blowin' smoke about the trampoline
being on its way too.

686
00:35:13,142 --> 00:35:15,811
"On a flatbed from Albuquerque",
he says.

687
00:35:15,936 --> 00:35:16,780
My ass!

688
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:20,075
- I thought you were an idiot.
- We've all been there.

689
00:35:20,366 --> 00:35:22,077
You got our frequencies.

690
00:35:22,626 --> 00:35:24,329
Wait. That doesn't make any sense.

691
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,875
If he had our frequency, he would have
known we were onto him and got out.

692
00:35:28,174 --> 00:35:29,974
He wasn't listening to us.

693
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:33,964
He has a microphone.

694
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,049
Who are you talking to?
Who's your partner?

695
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,801
If he had a partner,
why would he need the think tank?

696
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:42,014
<i>The only tactic is to have
the security team look the other way.</i>

697
00:35:43,071 --> 00:35:45,439
They needed ideas.
They tried once and they failed.

698
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,239
The hit woman gave them the plan.
Wait a minute.

699
00:35:48,364 --> 00:35:50,898
- Which vent did you find him in?
- It was the one off the back wall?

700
00:35:52,003 --> 00:35:54,667
<i>You're wasting all your us here
at this back wall.</i>

701
00:35:54,792 --> 00:35:57,654
<i>You leave your access points,
The doors, the wings, more open.</i>

702
00:35:58,674 --> 00:36:00,115
I know who we're looking for.

703
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:03,518
Boyd purposely directed us away
from the vents.

704
00:36:03,643 --> 00:36:07,647
- Snowden had a mole in the room.
- Where did we put Boyd on the detail?

705
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:10,625
Upstairs. I wasn't about
to trust somebody I didn't know.

706
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:11,750
Split up.

707
00:36:13,913 --> 00:36:15,625
But onto a more serious sub...

708
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,232
OK, you're out of here.

709
00:36:17,357 --> 00:36:20,766
- I'm trying to undo some damage here.
- Are you kidding me? I inspired them.

710
00:36:20,891 --> 00:36:23,710
- I don't want to argue. Just go.
- There's another killer.

711
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,351
In the building,
there's two of 'em. It's a team.

712
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:41,440
Let's take a left here.
Is your car waiting for you?

713
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:43,352
Of course, it is.
Where's my team?

714
00:36:43,477 --> 00:36:45,627
Gus is getting them. Don't worry.

715
00:36:47,553 --> 00:36:49,653
- Move, move, move!
- Look out!

716
00:36:54,693 --> 00:36:55,943
Son of a bitch!

717
00:36:59,963 --> 00:37:01,051
Boyd's gone.

718
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,369
To your car, and we're home free.

719
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:08,457
Clear! Go!

720
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:21,388
Go, go, go!

721
00:37:23,752 --> 00:37:25,202
What's the hold up?

722
00:37:26,158 --> 00:37:27,507
Oh, man.

723
00:37:29,684 --> 00:37:32,238
What are you, a hired gun?
I get it with Snowden.

724
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:33,584
He wanted vengeance.

725
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:36,336
You're gonna throw everything away
for another man's vendetta?

726
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,755
You don't remember me
from the trial, do you?

727
00:37:40,422 --> 00:37:41,550
She was my sister.

728
00:37:42,516 --> 00:37:46,285
You and your lawyers
decided her life was worth $1.2 million.

729
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:48,432
"It's more than fair", they said.

730
00:37:48,863 --> 00:37:50,142
I tried to make amends.

731
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,953
Let me handle this.
I have experience in these situations.

732
00:37:53,078 --> 00:37:54,187
You wrote checks.

733
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,608
That's all you did. We took your money,
and we put it towards making you pay.

734
00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:00,380
It's kind of ironic, isn't it?
You financed your own murder.

735
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,779
Boyd, or whatever your real name is,

736
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,116
- You are a very smart man.
- You're an idiot.

737
00:38:06,687 --> 00:38:08,870
You were worthless in that room,
and you're useless now.

738
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,371
We can all agree
than name-calling is beneath you.

739
00:38:11,803 --> 00:38:13,290
It's not gonna work.

740
00:38:13,587 --> 00:38:16,001
I got your guy locked in my sights,
and I will shoot him.

741
00:38:16,398 --> 00:38:19,338
Unless you want to be the second victim,
I suggest you hold very still.

742
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:22,898
Who are you kidding? If you were gonna
kill him, you would have already shot.

743
00:38:23,023 --> 00:38:24,134
This is personal.

744
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,845
I'm waiting to see
the right look on his face.

745
00:38:29,731 --> 00:38:32,976
Remember when we were in the room,
and I was talkin' about trampolines?

746
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,103
They're incredibly therapeutic.

747
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,731
So why don't you and I
go find ourselves a big one

748
00:38:38,084 --> 00:38:40,359
- And bounce like gentlemen?
- Are you suicidal? Is that it?

749
00:38:49,071 --> 00:38:51,671
- Get out of the car!
- Hands in the air!

750
00:38:54,777 --> 00:38:56,094
- You got him?
- I got him.

751
00:38:56,219 --> 00:38:58,251
You all right?
Let me ask you a question.

752
00:39:01,934 --> 00:39:04,549
Do you hate waking up
with bed head in the mornings?

753
00:39:06,124 --> 00:39:07,424
What? I can't...

754
00:39:07,549 --> 00:39:09,915
You know what? Never mind.
It's okay.

755
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:16,144
You want to tell me
what this is about?

756
00:39:16,761 --> 00:39:19,666
Wanted you to know
that I saw you at the pizza place.

757
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:22,564
You know,
I missed a lot of Shawn's games

758
00:39:22,689 --> 00:39:24,864
when he was a kid.
I just wanted to see him work.

759
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,356
Exactly how much input do you have
in Shawn's cases?

760
00:39:31,082 --> 00:39:33,954
I get involved in the process,
I guess, and then his...

761
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,832
You know, his psychic-ness,
it just takes over.

762
00:39:39,581 --> 00:39:40,712
You retired young.

763
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:43,879
- Yeah, maybe a little.
- And you like being involved in cases?

764
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:45,905
I'd be lying if I didn't tell

765
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,968
that I still got a bit of fuel left
in my tank.

766
00:39:48,137 --> 00:39:50,554
- I haven't regrets. I've learned that.
- Do you want a job?

767
00:39:52,069 --> 00:39:52,806
What?

768
00:39:55,862 --> 00:39:59,654
Look, what happened this week is a mess,
and it can't happen again.

769
00:39:59,924 --> 00:40:02,314
We've been discussing
for quite a while, creating

770
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:04,689
a new position, a liaison of sorts,

771
00:40:04,814 --> 00:40:08,094
that would oversee
our external divisions.

772
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:10,907
Working with other departments,
agencies, outside help.

773
00:40:11,285 --> 00:40:12,158
Psychics.

774
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,661
Our consultants would fall
under that category, yes.

775
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,446
Don't get me wrong.
The benefits far outweigh the costs,

776
00:40:20,571 --> 00:40:24,045
but your son has turned this department
on its head over the last four years.

777
00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:27,173
- Try my life over the last 30.
- It wouldn't be a full-time position,

778
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:30,981
Just part-time, few days a week.
We could discuss your schedule. All...

779
00:40:31,106 --> 00:40:34,583
it would take is just
a little consideration on your part.

780
00:40:38,651 --> 00:40:41,521
All right, listen, Karen,
that's a very astute observation,

781
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,389
and a fascinating offer,

782
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:46,541
But I think I'm gonna stay retired.

783
00:40:51,437 --> 00:40:52,837
And say thank you.

784
00:40:55,942 --> 00:40:56,828
You're sure?

785
00:41:09,093 --> 00:41:11,689
- Who are you talkin' to?
- Credit card company.

786
00:41:11,814 --> 00:41:14,058
Oh, yes, as I was saying,

787
00:41:14,302 --> 00:41:17,314
somebody used my card
to purchase a zebra-striped jacket.

788
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:20,268
- I would like that charge removed.
- You charged that jacket.

789
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,944
Gus, I said somebody.
Doesn't mean it wasn't me.

790
00:41:23,069 --> 00:41:25,273
How was I supposed to know
that Snowden's check was bogus?

791
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,815
Yes, of course, I'll hold.
I love holding.

792
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:31,905
There's a lesson to be learned here.
Do not spend your think tank money

793
00:41:32,074 --> 00:41:35,298
before you know whether the think tank
is run by a vindictive murderer or not.

794
00:41:35,423 --> 00:41:38,113
The real lesson is that we need to get
into corporate consulting,

795
00:41:38,238 --> 00:41:40,305
because that's where
we'll build our nest egg.

796
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:41,414
What you mean?

797
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,290
Giant trampoline for the office.

798
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:46,465
We'll never get another corporate gig,
so it doesn't matter.

799
00:41:48,787 --> 00:41:49,881
We have two lines?

800
00:41:51,665 --> 00:41:53,301
Who do we know
in Bulgarian consulate?

801
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,929
That's me. Here.
Here, trade.

802
00:41:56,225 --> 00:41:57,875
Another consulting gig.

803
00:41:58,511 --> 00:42:00,940
<i>Hola!</i>
<i>Como estan ustedes?</i>

804
00:42:01,065 --> 00:42:03,376
<i>Mi llamo es Shawnito Rodriguez.</i>

805
00:42:03,501 --> 00:42:06,213
<i>Mi gusta Bulgaria, y...</i>

806
00:42:06,845 --> 00:42:08,682
<i>Y trampolina gigante!</i>

807
00:42:08,944 --> 00:42:10,266
<i>Explosianos.</i>

808
00:42:12,344 --> 00:42:13,594
<i>Por... Por que?</i>

809
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:19,605
<i>I'm too sexy for my jacket
Too sexy for my jacket</i>

810
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:22,050
<i>It's such a racket</i>

811
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:26,126
<i>And I'm too sexy for my gun
Too sexy for my gun</i>

812
00:42:26,537 --> 00:42:27,757
<i>It's just no fun</i>

813
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:31,875
<i>I'm too sexy for your party
Too sexy for your party</i>

814
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,176
<i>No way I'm disco dancing</i>

815
00:42:34,582 --> 00:42:37,425
<i>Cause I'm a model,
you know what I mean </i>

816
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:40,475
<i>And I do my little turn
on the catwalk</i>

817
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,175
<i>Yeah, you know what I mean </i>

818
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,500
<i>I do my little turn on the catwalk </i>
