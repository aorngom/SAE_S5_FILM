1
00:00:03,196 --> 00:00:04,196
<i>Jaws IV</i>?

2
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:06,723
Yes, <i>Jaws IV</i>. It was terrified.

3
00:00:06,848 --> 00:00:08,743
You have to understand
why I'm conflicted here.

4
00:00:08,868 --> 00:00:12,511
It's very difficult to comfort you
over what is the worst sequel ever made.

5
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:13,638
Dad...

6
00:00:13,807 --> 00:00:16,282
Shawn, you are not gonna
be eaten by a shark.

7
00:00:16,407 --> 00:00:18,908
Sharks do not attack
people willy-nilly.

8
00:00:19,033 --> 00:00:22,104
That's crazy. So many random scenarios
have to line up.

9
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:23,846
- Really?
- Of course.

10
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:25,399
The shark has to be hungry.

11
00:00:25,721 --> 00:00:27,658
He has to be attracted
to jumping, kicking,

12
00:00:27,783 --> 00:00:31,113
or sudden movements in the water
or maybe even somebody with a cut.

13
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:34,158
But isn't it true that most shark
attacks occur in 3 feet of water?

14
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:37,161
Of course it is.
But that's where the swimmers are.

15
00:00:37,286 --> 00:00:38,704
So that's a skewed sample.

16
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,622
Do I watch for the fin?

17
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:42,849
No, that only happens in the movies.

18
00:00:42,974 --> 00:00:44,502
You never see them coming.

19
00:00:44,773 --> 00:00:46,629
That's why they're called
the silent killers.

20
00:00:47,913 --> 00:00:49,674
I thought that was hypertension.

21
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:50,935
Either way,

22
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,010
stop thinking about it.
Could you do that?

23
00:00:57,721 --> 00:00:59,432
Anyways,
don't they sleep during the day?

24
00:00:59,668 --> 00:01:00,935
No, sharks never sleep.

25
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:05,064
Just get out there, have some fun,
and remember... slow, steady movements.

26
00:01:05,793 --> 00:01:06,793
Get in.

27
00:01:09,973 --> 00:01:11,028
That a boy.

28
00:01:17,698 --> 00:01:18,698


29
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,254
- What are you doing?
- No time to talk. Keep taking notes.

30
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,422
What's the rush?

31
00:02:14,123 --> 00:02:14,924
That.

32
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:18,304
Every time we get a high-profile case,
you know what's gonna happen next.

33
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:21,108
Spencer's gonna waltz in here,
make some crazy proclamation

34
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:24,497
about what happened,
and in five days, he's gonna be right.

35
00:02:24,622 --> 00:02:25,478
Not today.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,646
McNab? Hold back the Wonder Twins.

37
00:02:28,499 --> 00:02:30,566
Oh, come on. Really, Buzz?

38
00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:33,296
This is the thanks I get
for giving you a cat

39
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:35,821
and finding a guy to remove
your "baja men" tattoo?

40
00:02:36,003 --> 00:02:37,947
Sorry, guys.
He's really determined today.

41
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,858
- Let's just go.
- You're probably right.

42
00:02:39,983 --> 00:02:42,847
You don't want to go down there.
I know how you feel about dead things.

43
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:45,153
You know, the whole...

44
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,858
Not only is that an affront
to my character,

45
00:02:50,983 --> 00:02:53,121
but I'll have you know,
I'm turning over a new leaf.

46
00:02:53,246 --> 00:02:54,756
I'm now hardened. I've seen it all.

47
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,977
You've seen it all through the cracks
in your fingers

48
00:02:57,102 --> 00:02:59,542
- while you're hiding your eyes.
- You know what? That's it.

49
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:01,985
That makes four years.
I don't need you to look out for me.

50
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,253
I have a new name now.

51
00:03:03,378 --> 00:03:05,684
For now on, I want you
to call me "Guts".

52
00:03:06,822 --> 00:03:09,135
- We all call you that.
- No. "Guts", Shawn.

53
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,664
What are you saying?
You're saying "Guts"?

54
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:13,761
- That's too close to Gus.
- You know, never mind.

55
00:03:13,886 --> 00:03:16,824
- Call me "old ironside".
- Michael Ironside?

56
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:18,399
Old iron stomach...

57
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,199
That's me.

58
00:03:20,385 --> 00:03:22,574
Carlton, you can't solve
a case in four minutes.

59
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:24,661
Can't I? I think I can.
I've seen it done.

60
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:26,371
- Not by you.
- Thanks for that.

61
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,057
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

62
00:03:28,182 --> 00:03:30,251
You are a great detective.
It's just that...

63
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:34,380
There's a piercing in the skin.

64
00:03:34,701 --> 00:03:37,465
There are lots of them.
It's a shark attack.

65
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:41,678
No, this one's different.
It's cleaner.

66
00:03:44,205 --> 00:03:46,517
- It's a knife wound.
- A knife wound?

67
00:03:47,893 --> 00:03:49,854
- Spencer would say it.
- You're not him.

68
00:03:50,023 --> 00:03:51,897
And thank the sweet lord for that.

69
00:03:53,646 --> 00:03:55,333
It's now or never, O'Hara.

70
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,569
Week after week,

71
00:03:56,738 --> 00:04:00,740
I sit idly by doing life-sucking,
soul-eating detailed police work

72
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:02,692
while he just bounces in

73
00:04:02,817 --> 00:04:05,661
and hops from one wild conclusion
to the next, only to be right.

74
00:04:06,022 --> 00:04:09,397
This knife wound is good. It's big.
And I'm gonna jump on it before he does.

75
00:04:09,522 --> 00:04:12,251
Today I'm going
to out-Spencer Spencer.

76
00:04:13,488 --> 00:04:15,296
All right, McNab. Send them down.

77
00:04:15,973 --> 00:04:16,973
Go ahead.

78
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:19,775
Carlton, no good can come of this.

79
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,552
It can only end disastrously.

80
00:04:22,384 --> 00:04:23,478
If by disastrously

81
00:04:23,603 --> 00:04:25,764
you mean triumphantly,
then, yes, I agree.

82
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,028
If not, I would like to invite you,
in the nicest way possible,

83
00:04:29,153 --> 00:04:30,019
to shut it.

84
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,903
Is this the same shark spotted last week
by the whale-watching boat?

85
00:04:34,028 --> 00:04:36,358
Can you give us any details
on the shark attack?

86
00:04:36,696 --> 00:04:40,279
We've got a couple problems with that.
First of all, our victim is a John Doe.

87
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,420
And what's the other problem?

88
00:04:43,095 --> 00:04:45,534
- Watch how I do this.
- Please don't make me.

89
00:04:46,471 --> 00:04:48,771
Our victim wasn't killed by a shark.

90
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:52,012
He was murdered.

91
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,086
No, seriously.

92
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:57,922
No, I'm not kidding.
He was murdered.

93
00:04:58,408 --> 00:05:00,662
What about those things
that look like shark bites?

94
00:05:00,787 --> 00:05:04,219
- Yeah, those are shark bites.
- And those at the shoulder?

95
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,097
Yes, those are also shark bites.

96
00:05:07,413 --> 00:05:10,434
- Can you spell your last name?
- You don't know how to spell Lassiter?

97
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:12,352
No, I do.
I just want to see if you did.

98
00:05:12,971 --> 00:05:14,229
One follow-up question.

99
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,347
Does the shark have an alibi?

100
00:05:17,341 --> 00:05:20,265
Do you think the shark can have
a fair trial in this jurisdiction,

101
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,649
or will you have to pick
your jury from the aquarium?

102
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:13,538
Psych 415 "The Head, the Tail,
the Whole Damn Episode"

103
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,195
Timing: Psych Team
www.sous-titres.eu

104
00:06:17,928 --> 00:06:19,877
"Detective Dipstick at it again?"

105
00:06:20,998 --> 00:06:22,805
What the hell do they mean "again"?

106
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,054
It's <i>The Courier</i>.
It's not even a real newspaper.

107
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:28,040
Nobody reads the paper
these days anyway.

108
00:06:28,165 --> 00:06:29,329
Why didn't you stop me?

109
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:33,008
I don't know. I guess I was busy RSVPing
my invitation to "shut it".

110
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:34,791
Sorry about that.

111
00:06:35,447 --> 00:06:38,287
You can still salvage this.
We just forget yesterday ever happened,

112
00:06:38,412 --> 00:06:40,433
and we find out
who it was that washed ashore.

113
00:06:40,558 --> 00:06:43,704
I've been at this. Nobody's been
reported missing locally or statewide.

114
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:47,058
I can't even I.D. the body.
I'm the worst detective ever.

115
00:06:47,183 --> 00:06:48,449
Mr. Dipstick...

116
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:51,076
Might I get you to sign
my copy of today's paper?

117
00:06:51,373 --> 00:06:52,870
That is libel...

118
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:54,435
Or slander.

119
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,188
It's also copyright infringement.
I registered this six months ago.

120
00:06:57,313 --> 00:06:59,835
- He did. Also "officer Whoopsie".
- I forgot about that.

121
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,922
You get 5% of any action-figure money
when Hasbro comes on board.

122
00:07:04,192 --> 00:07:05,257
This is your fault.

123
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,176
- My fault?
- You got all up in my head.

124
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,928
First of all, I wouldn't last 5 minutes
in your head.

125
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,942
That was some ribbing
between colleagues. Here's the thing...

126
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:15,066
I honestly think
you're on the right track.

127
00:07:15,191 --> 00:07:17,728
If you hadn't had McNab stop us,
we would have made the same guess.

128
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:21,648
- I would have guessed ape attack.
- Gus, it's never, ever an ape attack.

129
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,735
- It will be. Mark my words.
- You saw the knife wound, did you not?

130
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:27,321
It looked like a knife wound,
I've regretted it since I said it.

131
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:29,490
Don't regret it.

132
00:07:30,328 --> 00:07:32,572
Don't you see? This should be
the best moment of your life.

133
00:07:32,697 --> 00:07:34,328
You should feel liberated...

134
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:38,039
in your guts,
because you're following your guts!

135
00:07:38,572 --> 00:07:41,134
You found the piece that didn't fit,

136
00:07:41,655 --> 00:07:43,761
and even though
you don't know how it connects,

137
00:07:43,886 --> 00:07:46,380
you announced it
to the world anyway.

138
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,134
Spencer, one loose end
doesn't make it foul play.

139
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,637
- It doesn't?
- How do we have stayed in business?

140
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:55,182
But what if it does, Lassie?
We're comrades now.

141
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:58,139
I do this all the time.
I can walk you through this.

142
00:07:58,264 --> 00:08:01,105
This is the weird part of the "spit out
a crazy theory" process.

143
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:04,010
You say it, everyone thinks
you're crazy, you're incompetent,

144
00:08:04,135 --> 00:08:05,953
you should probably
color your sideburns.

145
00:08:06,078 --> 00:08:07,140
Truth...

146
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,987
We're one in the same.

147
00:08:09,206 --> 00:08:10,588
We're "Shassie" now.

148
00:08:10,844 --> 00:08:13,283
We're "Sharlton".
We're "Spencitter".

149
00:08:13,954 --> 00:08:14,827
Oh, my God.

150
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:18,455
Make no mistake.
This is definitely your fault.

151
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:20,707
I've heard that,
but I'm trying to figure out how.

152
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,335
We are going to the coroner's office,
and you're coming with.

153
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,962
Sweet. I love that guy.

154
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,457
All right, I can take it.

155
00:08:29,771 --> 00:08:31,721
It was a shark attack, right?

156
00:08:31,896 --> 00:08:33,720
- I was told to wait.
- For what?

157
00:08:34,717 --> 00:08:37,683
- Woody!
- Hello, friend. Now we can begin.

158
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,310
The victim was chewed off
just below the waist...

159
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,838
- Tin tummy.
- Iron stomach.

160
00:08:42,963 --> 00:08:44,962
Was found wearing
a very expensive watch,

161
00:08:45,087 --> 00:08:46,576
not waterproof...

162
00:08:46,862 --> 00:08:48,652
Which is not typical
of a serious boatsman.

163
00:08:49,087 --> 00:08:52,531
We have no fingerprints, naturally,
as there... There are no fingers.

164
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,136
Continue.

165
00:08:56,261 --> 00:08:58,578
Cut off at the wrist, huh?
Interesting.

166
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,843
- Is there anything to help us I.D. him?
- Dental records were inconclusive.

167
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:04,459
We do have the remnants of a belt,

168
00:09:05,528 --> 00:09:07,439
which means the man
probably had a wallet on him

169
00:09:07,564 --> 00:09:09,489
which would likely still
be inside the shark,

170
00:09:09,614 --> 00:09:10,969
until it's digested.

171
00:09:11,094 --> 00:09:13,427
We could find a finger in there
we could get a print off of.

172
00:09:13,855 --> 00:09:15,393
- How do you feel?
- Peachy.

173
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,344
I give up.
Our prime suspect is a shark.

174
00:09:18,469 --> 00:09:20,442
You're giving up
on the murder thing already?

175
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:22,227
What about the suspicious
stab wound?

176
00:09:22,534 --> 00:09:24,847
Now that I look at it,
you know, in the lights and everything,

177
00:09:24,972 --> 00:09:26,972
it looks just like
a shark-bite wound.

178
00:09:27,097 --> 00:09:30,132
Don't do it, Lassie.
Don't... do it.

179
00:09:30,411 --> 00:09:31,819
Stick to your guns.

180
00:09:32,473 --> 00:09:33,639
Follow your instincts.

181
00:09:33,764 --> 00:09:35,824
Believe in yourself
like I believe in you.

182
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:38,452
- Do not start singing right now.
- Actually, Lassie,

183
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,537
that particular wound,
it's intriguing.

184
00:09:41,662 --> 00:09:44,600
Now, I'm not saying it's likely,
but I cannot, in good conscience,

185
00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:47,127
according to my oath,
say it is not a knife wound.

186
00:09:47,601 --> 00:09:48,951
What do you mean?

187
00:09:49,664 --> 00:09:50,923
You see, it's...

188
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:53,356
It's jagged, like a tooth mark,

189
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,179
but it's slightly
different from the others.

190
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,890
It's difficult to tell
without finding the rest of the body,

191
00:10:00,544 --> 00:10:03,310
- it could have been made by a knife.
- You're saying I could have been right?

192
00:10:03,483 --> 00:10:05,938
The knife would have to have
the characteristics of shark teeth.

193
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,205
What would this knife look like?

194
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,237
Probably something...

195
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:11,919
like this.

196
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,113
And then we've got,
you know, the teeth...

197
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,573
- Jagged there.
- Sure.

198
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,782
Dear God, what am I doing?

199
00:10:20,362 --> 00:10:21,536
This is half a man.

200
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,497
It's all right. Look at that.
You see that? You see it match?

201
00:10:24,752 --> 00:10:26,987
- It's a reach.
- Reach? Lassie...

202
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:29,962
Do you ever get tired of being wrong,
of being beaten to the punch?

203
00:10:30,437 --> 00:10:33,264
Would you trust your guts
and let those reporters know

204
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:35,676
that it is them who are
actually the Dipsticks?

205
00:10:37,076 --> 00:10:38,011
All right.

206
00:10:38,136 --> 00:10:40,639
Let's get a chopper in the air,
get us a boat and a decent fishermen.

207
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:43,107
We're gonna find this shark,
slice it open, I.D. the victim,

208
00:10:43,232 --> 00:10:45,477
and then we're gonna figure out
who wanted to murder him.

209
00:10:45,602 --> 00:10:47,840
- Do my theories sound that insane?
- Sometimes insaner.

210
00:10:47,965 --> 00:10:49,928
- So we're back on murder?
- Shut it.

211
00:10:50,053 --> 00:10:51,971
You say that again, I shoot you.

212
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:55,367
That is the spirit, man.
You are back on the crazy train.

213
00:10:55,492 --> 00:10:57,284
You want to know how I do it next?

214
00:10:58,228 --> 00:11:00,951
That felt like a reluctant no.
We should follow.

215
00:11:09,988 --> 00:11:13,152
- What in the world is going on here?
- Somebody put out a $10,000 reward

216
00:11:13,277 --> 00:11:14,623
for the capture of the shark.

217
00:11:14,748 --> 00:11:16,627
Now every nut job in town
with an outboard

218
00:11:16,752 --> 00:11:18,468
is hitting the water
trying to find it.

219
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,873
Is that dynamite?
Wait, wait, wait.

220
00:11:20,998 --> 00:11:23,640
Stop right there,
you backwoods hill people.

221
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,767
There is evidence in that shark!

222
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:27,083
Get back...

223
00:11:27,428 --> 00:11:29,072
Have you got a license for that?

224
00:11:29,905 --> 00:11:32,799
- This is where it gets harder.
- Leave me alone.

225
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,062
Sir, I need to commandeer your boat.

226
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,612
It's vegetarian.

227
00:11:38,685 --> 00:11:41,241
So you're telling me that every boat
you have has been rented.

228
00:11:41,504 --> 00:11:43,315
Every lure, every reel.

229
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,787
$10,000 reward
is a lot of money, officer.

230
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:48,616
Really? You see this?

231
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,256
That ain't gonna
make a boat suddenly appear.

232
00:11:51,381 --> 00:11:53,169
It isn't gonna fix my engine either.

233
00:11:53,515 --> 00:11:55,892
Really?
All right, then, how about this?

234
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,133
Check with me tomorrow.

235
00:11:59,258 --> 00:12:01,302
I may have this thing up
and running by dawn.

236
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:05,140
No, no, tomorrow's way too late.
I need you to fix thing thing now!

237
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,059
You're worse
than that guy in the papers.

238
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,769
What's his name, detective...

239
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:09,811
Dipstick!

240
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,228
Not another word!

241
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,390
- Who's that?
- He's not with me.

242
00:12:18,288 --> 00:12:19,834
I can't believe I'm supporting this,

243
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:21,762
but I have managed
to secure a police boat.

244
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,564
Sweet!
We can put our heads together...

245
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:26,264
Two mismatched partners off
on a harebrained adventure.

246
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:28,245
Spencer,
I want nothing to do with you.

247
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,324
We are not <i>compadres</i>.
We are not partners.

248
00:12:30,453 --> 00:12:32,186
We are nothing.
Are we at least <i>amigos</i>?

249
00:12:32,311 --> 00:12:33,835
- Homeboys?
- Platonic soul mates?

250
00:12:35,782 --> 00:12:36,922
Shove off, captain.

251
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:39,966
I've got a man-eating shark to catch
with evidence inside.

252
00:12:40,215 --> 00:12:41,885
It's almost as if we're not invited.

253
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,977
- Not you too.
- What?

254
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:54,189
- You're going after the shark reward?
- What? What are you, crazy?

255
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:57,185
- What's with all the equipment?
- This stuff belongs to a buddy of mine.

256
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,653
We're gonna go out,
and we're gonna hunt some marlin.

257
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,612
Wayans? Well, it's about time.

258
00:13:02,117 --> 00:13:04,609
Get out there, quick,
before they make another <i>White Chicks</i>.

259
00:13:04,734 --> 00:13:06,584
<i>White Chicks</i> was hilarious.

260
00:13:08,335 --> 00:13:10,461
Look, Carlton,
so you didn't catch the shark.

261
00:13:10,586 --> 00:13:13,586
It doesn't mean you're a bad cop.
It only means that you're a bad...

262
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:15,858
Fisherman? I'm sorry...

263
00:13:16,526 --> 00:13:18,756
Were you about to say
that I'm a bad fisherman?

264
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,398
I am only saying that
what happened today is not a reflection

265
00:13:21,523 --> 00:13:23,026
on your abilities as a detective.

266
00:13:23,151 --> 00:13:25,778
- I was being supportive.
- By saying I'm a bad fisherman.

267
00:13:25,903 --> 00:13:27,316
Only comparatively...

268
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:29,574
I didn't see anybody else
get their tie caught in a reel

269
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:31,518
or fire their gun
pointlessly into the water.

270
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,096
It wasn't pointlessly!

271
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:35,439
I told you, that driftwood
looked like a dorsal fin.

272
00:13:35,608 --> 00:13:38,460
Then why did you yell freeze
and hold your badge up first?

273
00:13:38,593 --> 00:13:39,719
Force of habit.

274
00:13:39,844 --> 00:13:42,821
And we both know that we got skunked,
we got stuck with inadequate gear.

275
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,022
- It looked fine to me.
- Are you k...

276
00:13:45,147 --> 00:13:48,098
I would have had better luck politely
asking the fish to jump in the boat.

277
00:13:48,223 --> 00:13:50,590
Trust me, O'Hara,
you know nothing about fishing.

278
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,910
Actually, I once spent
three weeks with my dad

279
00:13:53,035 --> 00:13:55,625
on a charter off islamorada.
We fed tarpon by hand.

280
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,044
You know what, little miss
"I obviously have daddy issues"?

281
00:13:58,169 --> 00:14:00,315
If you want me to take a trip
down memory lane with you,

282
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,099
why don't you start by not
insulting the core of my being?

283
00:14:03,224 --> 00:14:05,557
Fishing is
one of my top-five skills...

284
00:14:05,682 --> 00:14:07,679
Right behind profiling
and skee-ball.

285
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,930
Carlton,
you are taking this personally.

286
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:12,725
I am only suggesting
that we bring in an expert.

287
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:14,728
Maybe I'm suggesting
that you shut it!

288
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:21,551
I am so sorry.

289
00:14:22,602 --> 00:14:23,904
I'm just dehydrated.

290
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,606
- I haven't seen that thing in 2 years.
- Man, I need to get my numbers up.

291
00:14:34,731 --> 00:14:36,708
We haven't had a paying case
in three weeks.

292
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,484
Don't you worry. I'm about to crack
the shark murder case.

293
00:14:39,609 --> 00:14:41,087
What? You're kidding, right?

294
00:14:41,669 --> 00:14:42,919
Check this out.

295
00:14:43,818 --> 00:14:45,547
- Shark tooth fi-letter.
- Filleter?

296
00:14:45,672 --> 00:14:47,054
This thing probably...

297
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:49,888
Kind of makes the same, exact wound
we saw at the coroner's office.

298
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,423
Let me get this straight.
You're doing real police work,

299
00:14:52,548 --> 00:14:54,476
and Lassiter's following
some crazy hunch?

300
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:57,104
- Stranger things have happened.
- Name one.

301
00:14:57,609 --> 00:15:01,316
Michelle Pfeiffer dated Fisher Stevens.
And then he actually cheated on her.

302
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:04,027
<i>It really wasn't about the reward.
It's about keeping the water safe.</i>

303
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,154
<i>But we got him.
We brought him in.</i>

304
00:15:08,113 --> 00:15:10,042
<i>We'll make a few dinners out of him.</i>

305
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:11,660


306
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:22,087
- I knew you lied to me at the marina.
- I did not lie to you.

307
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:25,507
I was going out to hook a marlin,
and I hooked a killer shark instead.

308
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:28,176
Now I'm a hero and $10,000 richer...

309
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,637
- Serendipity.
- We need to see that shark.

310
00:15:30,911 --> 00:15:34,598
- So now you're interested in fishing?
- Sort of. Gus and I need a subject

311
00:15:34,723 --> 00:15:37,227
for an icky thump-ology experiment
we're doing in our tree-house lab.

312
00:15:37,524 --> 00:15:39,594
The study of fish
is called ichthyology.

313
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:42,281
That's right. Remind me to put it
on my list of funny words,

314
00:15:42,406 --> 00:15:44,525
right between avuncular
and mangrove.

315
00:15:45,064 --> 00:15:48,033
We just need to see the shark's teeth
to see if they match a wound.

316
00:15:48,158 --> 00:15:48,989
Wait.

317
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,223
Are you working
with detective Dipstick on this?

318
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,349
- You're calling him that too?
- I tried not to.

319
00:15:53,474 --> 00:15:56,364
- It just rolls right off the tongue.
- Where is this thing, in the fridge?

320
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,373
What do you think?
It's 9 feet long!

321
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:01,626
I have it on ice,
but it's at an undisclosed location.

322
00:16:03,483 --> 00:16:05,647
I'm getting something.
It's not dull.

323
00:16:05,772 --> 00:16:07,071
Sharp's storage!

324
00:16:07,852 --> 00:16:08,744
Disclosed.

325
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:11,177
Did you just pretend
to be a psychic, to me?

326
00:16:11,351 --> 00:16:14,097
- Sorry. It's force of habit.
- Nobody is touching that shark.

327
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:17,189
- We will be in and out in quickly.
- A photographer come tomorrow morning

328
00:16:17,314 --> 00:16:18,852
to take a picture of me with it.

329
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,936
- For your Facebook page?
- No. Magazine.

330
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:22,734
- <i>Fish Digest</i>?
- <i>Bald guys quarterly</i>?

331
00:16:22,859 --> 00:16:24,608
- <i>Coot's life</i>?
- Stop it.

332
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,858
I feared it would be a Spencer
that got to that shark before me.

333
00:16:28,983 --> 00:16:30,947
I can't believe it turned out
to be the other one.

334
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:32,856
I think I should be offended.

335
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:34,951
Compliment to you.
Insult to your dad.

336
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,745
- Well-executed two-fister.
- Nice.

337
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:38,822
That shark is part
of my ongoing investigation,

338
00:16:38,947 --> 00:16:41,583
- and I need to see it.
- That seems to be going around.

339
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,002
Henry, I'm appealing to you
as a policeman and a father.

340
00:16:44,797 --> 00:16:46,713
What the hell do you
know about being a father?

341
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,716
It's official! You heard
detective Dipstick. Let's do this.

342
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:01,019
- There isn't somebody to let you in?
- He was here. He had the key.

343
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,730
- Are you sure you can do this?
- I can do anything I want!

344
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,203
Son of a...

345
00:17:12,259 --> 00:17:13,698
I know what you're thinking.

346
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,409
But I am not getting any pleasure out
of your "beflusterment" at this moment.

347
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:21,372
Not true... I'm getting a fair amount.
But I'm still on your side.

348
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,083
- Well?
- Don't look at me like that.

349
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,628
That fish was gonna pay
for my new roof.

350
00:17:28,021 --> 00:17:30,495
This is just great.
Someone steals my shark.

351
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,997
They're impeding a police investigation,
what's more, I look like a total fool.

352
00:17:34,122 --> 00:17:36,604
I get it... All of a sudden,
this is all about you.

353
00:17:36,957 --> 00:17:38,808
Don't you get
all self-righteous on me.

354
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:39,736
Father!

355
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:41,685
I am in the middle of
a murder investigation,

356
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,455
and you're worried about
is your money.

357
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,248
A murder investigation?

358
00:17:45,373 --> 00:17:48,552
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but let's be reasonable.

359
00:17:53,228 --> 00:17:55,126
Pick up a telephone.
Say, "Hey, Lassiter, I..."

360
00:17:55,251 --> 00:17:57,953
The thief was here recently,
within the hour.

361
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:00,617
I couldn't pick up my phone.
I dropped it in the water.

362
00:18:00,742 --> 00:18:02,941
Would you cut the crap?
You sound worse than your kid!

363
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:04,902
See that trail of ice?
It's barely melted.

364
00:18:05,027 --> 00:18:06,784
That means whoever did
this is still near.

365
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:08,977
So what, you're gonna
track a shark on land?

366
00:18:09,102 --> 00:18:10,878
It seems easier
than doing it on the water.

367
00:18:11,003 --> 00:18:12,874
- It's not.
- I will track this thing

368
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:15,662
like I tracked that sea lion
to the deepest part of the big blue.

369
00:18:15,787 --> 00:18:18,255
You stole a guy's old GPS coordinates
for that.

370
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,280
That changes the result how?

371
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,291
I can narrow it down to that way.

372
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,258
Give me your keys.

373
00:18:25,383 --> 00:18:27,146
- It's a few blocks away.
- I don't care.

374
00:18:28,262 --> 00:18:30,132
- Dad!
- It's right there!

375
00:18:30,257 --> 00:18:31,257
Dad!

376
00:18:32,596 --> 00:18:35,113
I'm sensing your shark.
It's nearby.

377
00:18:35,696 --> 00:18:38,197
Warm up your super-sniffer.
We're gonna need it.

378
00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:39,889
I got it.

379
00:18:40,936 --> 00:18:41,786
We'll drive.

380
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,824
The toothed beast is here.

381
00:18:47,949 --> 00:18:48,835
Where?

382
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,240
Somewhere...

383
00:18:52,139 --> 00:18:53,515
Over there.

384
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,576
Here.

385
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:56,289
No, it's this general...

386
00:18:56,765 --> 00:18:59,428
It's this general area here.

387
00:19:00,202 --> 00:19:01,252
Probably...

388
00:19:01,619 --> 00:19:03,279
Stuffed back

389
00:19:03,404 --> 00:19:05,878
behind these large beads of...

390
00:19:07,078 --> 00:19:08,104
I'm wrong!

391
00:19:08,578 --> 00:19:09,732
It's this way.

392
00:19:11,206 --> 00:19:13,656
Oh, my Gosh.
It's definitely over there.

393
00:19:14,456 --> 00:19:16,236
That's just... That's just foul.

394
00:19:31,507 --> 00:19:32,378
I'm okay.

395
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:35,548
And thank you so much for helping
get the big, dead shark off of me!

396
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:40,456
Someone didn't want us
to find the contents

397
00:19:40,581 --> 00:19:42,013
of this shark's belly.

398
00:19:45,144 --> 00:19:47,602
- We're looking at a cover-up.
- You're looking at the wrong shark.

399
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:51,401
- Who the hell are you?
- Dr. Kimberly Phenix.

400
00:19:51,526 --> 00:19:53,773
I run the ocean studies department
at the university.

401
00:19:53,898 --> 00:19:55,777
I'm also
a pretty decent shark expert.

402
00:19:55,965 --> 00:19:58,279
- I didn't call for a shark expert.
- Actually, you did.

403
00:19:58,404 --> 00:20:00,722
Your partner called me yesterday,
but I was out.

404
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,618
So you're the one they call
detective Dipstick?

405
00:20:03,842 --> 00:20:05,240
Detective Lassiter.

406
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,725
Head detective Carlton Lassiter.

407
00:20:08,935 --> 00:20:10,534
That's okay. I read the article.

408
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:13,253
Had some bad ink myself too.
The press can be so snarky.

409
00:20:13,607 --> 00:20:14,712
How'd you find us?

410
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,924
I followed you. I was the one honking
as you ran through all the red lights.

411
00:20:18,094 --> 00:20:20,593
That is the god-given right
of any working police officer, lady.

412
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:22,663
Yeah, I was talking about him.

413
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:25,367
So I saw you on TV
when you caught this guy.

414
00:20:25,911 --> 00:20:27,767
Can't say I wasn't
a little impressed.

415
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:32,118
- Thank you, miss...
- Miss... That's sweet, but it's doctor.

416
00:20:32,243 --> 00:20:34,816
Or just Kim. But not Dr. Kim,
'cause I'm not a radio show host.

417
00:20:35,351 --> 00:20:37,318
All right, doctor... Kim...

418
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:40,029
I'm gonna have to respectfully disagree
with you about that fish.

419
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,353
Me too. I've done my homework.
This is the shark.

420
00:20:42,478 --> 00:20:44,477
It's a man-eater,
and it's rare for these waters.

421
00:20:44,602 --> 00:20:46,202
You're right, but only kind of.

422
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:48,997
The shark you're looking for is
indeed <i>Galeocerdo cuvier</i>...

423
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,915
- A what?
- A tiger shark.

424
00:20:51,653 --> 00:20:53,000
- Very good.
- Thank you.

425
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,920
But the shark that attacked

426
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,007
is probably more in the neighborhood
of a 17-footer, not this little guy.

427
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:00,350
Wait a minute.

428
00:21:00,624 --> 00:21:01,967
That is not a little guy.

429
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:03,938
Duly noted. And, yeah, it is.

430
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:05,597
Incidentally, I was...

431
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:08,046
glad to see that it was a former cop
who caught the shark

432
00:21:08,171 --> 00:21:10,518
- instead of a shark hunter.
- My intentions were good.

433
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:12,145
He wanted the reward.

434
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:14,397
I was trying to keep the water safe
for the children.

435
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:17,567
- Were you, really?
- All right, the reward crossed my mind,

436
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:19,944
but a divorced man
has to build his nest egg.

437
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,739
Did you just casually
slip the word divorced

438
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,936
into a sentence
to an apparently single woman?

439
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,785
Did you just casually slip
single woman into your response?

440
00:21:28,426 --> 00:21:29,370
Touche.

441
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,574
- Is this really happening?
- Yes.

442
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:34,443
I think your dad
is totally in there.

443
00:21:34,568 --> 00:21:36,205
Please, Gus, where's the decorum?

444
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,670
He's hitting on this poor woman
in the middle of a crime scene.

445
00:21:38,795 --> 00:21:41,393
You did that three times
in the last year.

446
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:44,615
I'll be right there.
A leg just washed up over on Dodd beach.

447
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,740
Let's go.

448
00:21:46,078 --> 00:21:47,768
- Care to join us?
- I'd love to.

449
00:21:47,893 --> 00:21:48,893
After you.

450
00:21:51,492 --> 00:21:53,577
Man, he's got every play
in your book.

451
00:21:53,702 --> 00:21:55,563
Or have you been using
his playbook all along?

452
00:21:57,932 --> 00:21:59,816
It's not a book. It's a binder.

453
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,531
- What happened to you?
- I don't want to talk about it.

454
00:22:07,301 --> 00:22:08,351
Who's that?

455
00:22:09,092 --> 00:22:10,407
My dad brought a date.

456
00:22:10,532 --> 00:22:12,785
I didn't know he was seeing anyone.
He met her today.

457
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,907
He brought a woman he
just met to an autopsy?

458
00:22:15,032 --> 00:22:16,232
Who does that?

459
00:22:16,554 --> 00:22:17,502
Shut up.

460
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,587
Maybe if we wait long enough,

461
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,090
we'll be able to piece
this poor guy together ourselves.

462
00:22:23,894 --> 00:22:25,301
I know how you feel, young man.

463
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,636
You just...
You have to breathe. In, out.

464
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,304
Come on, in, out. That's it.

465
00:22:30,073 --> 00:22:32,850
Concentrate on your breathing.
You'll do fine.

466
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,302
Massive tissue loss.

467
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:38,648
Partially denuded bone,
and some odd markings

468
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:40,065
right here near the ankle.

469
00:22:40,451 --> 00:22:42,700
Almost like he was
tethered to something,

470
00:22:42,825 --> 00:22:44,296
like a-a surfboard.

471
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,509
- Do we have an I.D.?
- Still pending.

472
00:22:46,634 --> 00:22:49,077
We do have some preliminary data,
and it's a bit odd.

473
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:52,155
It appears imbedded right here.

474
00:22:52,842 --> 00:22:54,038
Surface tissue...

475
00:22:54,653 --> 00:22:56,416
with completely different DNA.

476
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,745
The shark must have had
this tissue wedged in its teeth

477
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,379
- when he chomped down on this poor guy.
- So what does this mean?

478
00:23:01,893 --> 00:23:03,756
It means there was a second victim.

479
00:23:10,043 --> 00:23:12,982
The prevailing wisdom
is that shark attacks are random acts

480
00:23:13,107 --> 00:23:15,143
committed by a beast driven
only by its next meal.

481
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:19,140
But I have a theory
that these attacks occur

482
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:21,441
under conditions determined
by a number of variables...

483
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:24,777
Air and water temperatures, currents,
time of year, things of that sort.

484
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:26,751
And they're anything but random.

485
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:28,677
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

486
00:23:29,738 --> 00:23:33,007
What? I'm responsible for everyone?
The machine's right outside the door.

487
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,863
By properly isolating the variables,
we can extrapolate the data

488
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,554
to predict and even
prevent future attacks.

489
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:46,911
Any questions?

490
00:23:47,148 --> 00:23:49,603
How long before the fingers
inside the shark's stomach are digested

491
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:51,176
and no longer usable for prints?

492
00:23:51,301 --> 00:23:52,994
There's more than one victim now.

493
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:55,157
The idea of murder is
seeming like a stretch.

494
00:23:55,282 --> 00:23:58,119
Maybe we should focus on the fact
that there's a shark eating people.

495
00:23:58,244 --> 00:24:00,749
Yes, but that doesn't mean
that our first victim wasn't murdered

496
00:24:00,874 --> 00:24:03,900
before he fell into the water
and was devoured by the shark.

497
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:05,968
Do not invite me to shut it.

498
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,710
I wasn't going to.

499
00:24:07,835 --> 00:24:09,982
Can you please tell me
where this thing is?

500
00:24:10,763 --> 00:24:13,895
Based on currents and where the body
and the leg washed ashore,

501
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,788
I can give you a better approximation,
I'll need some time to run the numbers.

502
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:19,684
Great. Let's get down to that marina
and get ourselves some real equipment

503
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:21,936
and find the right shark
before some idiot in a sea bus

504
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:23,878
rolls over it with a propeller.

505
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:26,491
I have never been more in love with you
than I am at this moment.

506
00:24:26,616 --> 00:24:28,174
You are virtually insane!

507
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:30,419
Getting real equipment
is going to be a problem.

508
00:24:30,544 --> 00:24:32,719
The mayor just upped
the reward to $50,000.

509
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:34,222
50,000?

510
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,516
Sorry.

511
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:38,953
What are we waiting for?
Let's get down there.

512
00:24:47,342 --> 00:24:49,195
Is it true the reward's
been increased?

513
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:52,163
Yes, the reward has
been increased to $50,000

514
00:24:52,288 --> 00:24:55,076
in an effort to keep the beaches open
during the holiday weekend.

515
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:57,912
However, I would like to implore

516
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,540
the overzealous middle-school
dropouts in the crowd

517
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,500
to exercise restraint.

518
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:06,129
Here's the bottom line. I'm not going
to commandeer your boats, per se,

519
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,214
although I believe I can.

520
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:12,311
Just know that you'll be performing
a great community service

521
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,178
if you turn it over us.

522
00:25:14,303 --> 00:25:17,783
Otherwise, I will be arresting you
for hindering a police investigation.

523
00:25:17,908 --> 00:25:20,268
What? O'Hara, I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

524
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:21,478
Come here.

525
00:25:22,891 --> 00:25:24,291
Don't go anywhere.

526
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:28,067
We found a guy matching
the description.

527
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,236
Figure out what he does
and who he is.

528
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:34,081
We know who he is. A web millionaire.
He came down a couple days ago.

529
00:25:34,961 --> 00:25:38,340
That's a really strong maybe.
So put McNab on it and get dramamine,

530
00:25:38,465 --> 00:25:41,330
because we are gonna stay
on that boat till we find the shark!

531
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,848
We found his car.

532
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,042
I'm still kind of talking
to the sea trash.

533
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,878
It's in the parking lot!

534
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,546
- This parking lot?
- Yes!

535
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:51,549
It was abandoned three nights ago,
and you need to see what's inside.

536
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:54,093
Let's go.

537
00:25:59,542 --> 00:26:01,861
His name is Dante Pavan.

538
00:26:02,233 --> 00:26:04,518
He has quite the personal
crusade going on.

539
00:26:04,643 --> 00:26:06,793
He's an ocean activist, big-time.

540
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,942
Oil drilling, whale-watching excursions.
Name it, he's against it.

541
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,153
He's brought
his personal crusade here.

542
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:13,563
Did he bring a boat?

543
00:26:13,688 --> 00:26:15,740
Nope. And no record
of a rental or a purchase.

544
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:18,034
Never even checked into his hotel.

545
00:26:18,852 --> 00:26:22,830
How did he get so far out in the current
with his expensive watch without a boat?

546
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,208
He's been known to stage crazy,
elaborate protests.

547
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:26,314
How crazy?

548
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,879
He threw himself into a fishing net
while a load was being pulled in.

549
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,882
He chained himself to a
buoy to protest whaling.

550
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,571
That actually made the news.

551
00:26:34,696 --> 00:26:37,234
He did the same thing
on an oil-tanker anchor.

552
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:40,063
<i>Rather odd markings
here near the ankle,</i>

553
00:26:40,188 --> 00:26:41,933
<i>almost like he was
tethered to something.</i>

554
00:26:43,271 --> 00:26:45,691
Where'd you go? We were
videotaping your speech.

555
00:26:45,816 --> 00:26:48,352
We need you to sign a release
for <i>America's Funniest Home Videos</i>.

556
00:26:48,477 --> 00:26:50,650
We're wrapping things up.
We've identified our victim.

557
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,735
What?
You're not going after the shark?

558
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:56,116
The only reason we needed the shark
was to ID the body... Dante Pavan.

559
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:58,449
He's an ocean activist nut job
from Seattle.

560
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,174
Leads an extreme group
called oceans first.

561
00:27:01,341 --> 00:27:03,454
That's so thin.
You're acting insane.

562
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,749
No, what's insane, is that I've been
listening to you for the last days.

563
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,247
This is who I am,
I am comforted by the facts,

564
00:27:09,372 --> 00:27:10,836
and these facts solve crimes.

565
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,909
This was a shark attack,
not a murder.

566
00:27:13,034 --> 00:27:16,301
Lassie, mark my words,
there is something in that shark.

567
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,928
Why else would somebody steal my dad's
and open the thing up?

568
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:20,255
I don't know.

569
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,641
Somebody wanted the reward money,
they figured out they got the wrong one.

570
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,709
That doesn't make any sense.

571
00:27:26,297 --> 00:27:29,040
O'Hara, check any snorkeling excursions,
whale-watching tours...

572
00:27:29,165 --> 00:27:31,734
See if anyone had a Dante
Pavan on the docket.

573
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,109
Bye, gentlemen.

574
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:35,216
This is where we part ways.

575
00:27:36,705 --> 00:27:38,829
So what? You want to go home,

576
00:27:39,176 --> 00:27:42,376
or you want to go watch your Dad
hit on that lady doctor for a while?

577
00:27:42,501 --> 00:27:45,371
I'd rather dip my jewels in honey,
then go on a bear watch.

578
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:48,166
Our work here is not finished.

579
00:27:48,791 --> 00:27:50,538
There's something in that shark.

580
00:27:50,663 --> 00:27:52,795
We need someone
to take us out to sea.

581
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,632
Excuse... if you could...

582
00:28:02,069 --> 00:28:04,390
- What are you doing?
- How do you make that sound?

583
00:28:16,543 --> 00:28:17,880
You all know me.

584
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:19,488
No, we don't.

585
00:28:21,188 --> 00:28:23,188
You know how I make my living.

586
00:28:24,966 --> 00:28:26,746
We're still unclear on who you are.

587
00:28:27,199 --> 00:28:28,706
I'm a psychic, Jack!

588
00:28:29,065 --> 00:28:30,791
Check your papers, not the front...

589
00:28:30,916 --> 00:28:33,318
Page five and further back,
sometimes the personals.

590
00:28:33,443 --> 00:28:35,854
But believe me... It's all there.

591
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:39,223
We remember Shabby, don't we?
Shabby the sea lion?

592
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,469
I tracked him at sea,

593
00:28:41,874 --> 00:28:44,138
found out where the poor
fellow was murdered...

594
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:45,598
In the entire ocean,

595
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:48,434
the exact spot.
Tell them, Gus.

596
00:28:48,837 --> 00:28:49,977
I'd rather not.

597
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:53,939
You know what else? I found
an abandoned boat, at sea, at night.

598
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,751
I have keen senses.
My senses are very keen.

599
00:28:56,876 --> 00:28:59,236
You know what? I'm gonna lay out
my history for you,

600
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:03,282
and by the end of it, you're all gonna
be begging for my services, okay?

601
00:29:03,449 --> 00:29:05,659
Four months ago,
guy walks into our office, says,

602
00:29:05,784 --> 00:29:08,660
"Help me. I'm a lycan." Gus is like,
"you're made out of seaweed?"

603
00:29:08,785 --> 00:29:11,288
I said, "no, no, Gus.
He's a werewolf."

604
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,165
We dressed up like civil war people,

605
00:29:14,332 --> 00:29:17,232
and Gus looked like Denzel Washington
in <i>Glory</i>.

606
00:29:17,511 --> 00:29:19,518
And some guy built a tunnel...

607
00:29:19,643 --> 00:29:23,471
About two years ago, some chick
got hit in the head with a tennis...

608
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:25,289
You know what? Screw that case.

609
00:29:25,414 --> 00:29:27,064
I looked at my partner.

610
00:29:27,255 --> 00:29:29,475
It was like looking
at a child lost in a mall.

611
00:29:30,105 --> 00:29:31,801
Luckily, I'd solved the case.

612
00:29:31,926 --> 00:29:34,323
The football players were
protecting their bonuses,

613
00:29:34,448 --> 00:29:38,067
and that's why they left the disembodied
foot on the path in the forest.

614
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:39,993
That's not why they did it.

615
00:29:40,193 --> 00:29:43,776
That one still confuses me.
The point is, that is but 20

616
00:29:44,128 --> 00:29:46,492
of my many, many cases
that I have solved.

617
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:49,370
You can read the book
when I learn how to type.

618
00:29:49,973 --> 00:29:53,977
Sir, the fact that you haven't left
shows me you're not afraid of my gift...

619
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:58,186
And are ready to use
it to catch this shark.

620
00:30:00,129 --> 00:30:02,279
I think we have ourselves a boat.

621
00:30:05,981 --> 00:30:09,907
Are we gonna get to sing sea chanteys
or any other kind of chanteys?

622
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,244
Do you have dramamine,
or should I just bring my own?

623
00:30:13,369 --> 00:30:15,404
Gus wants to know
if you have cable on your boat,

624
00:30:15,529 --> 00:30:18,246
it's the season finale of <i>Leverage</i>
and his Tivo's on the fritz.

625
00:30:18,371 --> 00:30:21,418
- Your job is to shut up.
- Okay, that's good. That's easy.

626
00:30:21,543 --> 00:30:24,796
I was worried to draw swabbing, which is
more difficult than remaining quiet.

627
00:30:24,921 --> 00:30:26,828
- You're failing at your job.
- Says you.

628
00:30:26,953 --> 00:30:29,003
Says the definition of shut up.

629
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:33,157
I need to get off this boat.

630
00:30:33,282 --> 00:30:36,091
Gus, don't be Leon
from the <i>Like of Prayer</i> video...

631
00:30:36,216 --> 00:30:37,746
Or anything, for that matter.

632
00:30:37,871 --> 00:30:40,271
We might actually
get to see a whale.

633
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:42,006
Fine. But after the whale.

634
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:44,746
You're on chum duty, princess.

635
00:30:54,276 --> 00:30:55,311
Nice.

636
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,156
All right, magician, where do we go?

637
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,655
Sharks are very unpredictable,
you know,

638
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,953
silent, but deadly.

639
00:31:13,662 --> 00:31:15,372
If it is he who smelt it,

640
00:31:16,115 --> 00:31:17,115
then...

641
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,419
It is also he who...
Who most likely dealt it.

642
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,630
What the hell are you talking about?

643
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:27,301
<i>These attacks occur under conditions
determined by different variables...</i>

644
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:29,178
<i>Temperatures, time of year,</i>

645
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:31,096
<i>currents, anything but random.</i>

646
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:34,123
I am sensing a number
of variables here...

647
00:31:35,315 --> 00:31:37,726
Air and water temperatures, currents,
the time of year.

648
00:31:37,851 --> 00:31:39,563
The shark is definitely
in a pattern.

649
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,050
Are you a biologist or a psychic?

650
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:51,659
The reef!

651
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:56,120
I can see it, the reef.
There is a harem of seals

652
00:31:56,245 --> 00:31:57,706
gathered there to mate

653
00:31:57,831 --> 00:32:00,231
and make succulent fondues.

654
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:02,762
The shark is also there...

655
00:32:04,262 --> 00:32:06,507
- Waiting.
- I know that spot.

656
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,610
A pod seals has been settled
in the area.

657
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,889
You might be worth
something after all.

658
00:32:16,232 --> 00:32:19,480
But I believe it's a...
It is a harem of seals.

659
00:32:20,774 --> 00:32:22,189
I've heard it both ways.

660
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:28,404
Hang in there, buddy.

661
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:35,266
We need to find out
what kind of protest stunt Pavan pulled

662
00:32:35,391 --> 00:32:37,601
in order to get
accidentally eaten by a shark.

663
00:32:37,726 --> 00:32:39,373
Maybe it wasn't a stunt.

664
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:43,419
Maybe it wasn't even an accident.
Maybe we jumped off murder too soon.

665
00:32:43,851 --> 00:32:47,677
You with Spencer on this now? Come on,
I just got my head back on straight.

666
00:32:47,802 --> 00:32:49,925
Look at this letter
I found in <i>The Courier</i>.

667
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,311
<i>The Courier</i>? No.

668
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:54,138
I would rather french-kiss a hobo
than read anything in that rag.

669
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:57,039
A simple "I don't like the writing"
would have made your point.

670
00:32:57,164 --> 00:33:00,144
I'm sorry, that paper
is not allowed in this station.

671
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:03,522
So you're going to ignore a clue
because you don't like a reporter?

672
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,802
Hate is the word, and, yes,
no good can be found in that paper,

673
00:33:06,927 --> 00:33:09,528
except maybe the obituary
for reporter Chad Gorsuch.

674
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,239
- Really?
- An untimely death

675
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:15,117
self-inflicted and painful. Later to be
referred to as gor-suching yourself.

676
00:33:15,916 --> 00:33:17,870
He's on a respirator
and dying slowly!

677
00:33:18,904 --> 00:33:20,704
That was very therapeutic.

678
00:33:21,164 --> 00:33:23,751
I actually feel quite better.
What do you got?

679
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:27,101
It's an open letter to "the criminal
fishing industry of Santa Barbara."

680
00:33:27,226 --> 00:33:29,461
It's fancily worded
and a little rambling,

681
00:33:29,586 --> 00:33:33,177
but it basically says, "stop your
illegal fishing practices, or I will."

682
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:35,179
He was taking on the whole industry?

683
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:38,015
Question is
who was he going after first?

684
00:33:43,729 --> 00:33:46,106
Move faster, you pantywaist!

685
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:50,203
Time's wasting! There's 200 other lines
in the water right now!

686
00:33:51,222 --> 00:33:54,156
- That is really gross, huh?
- You need to take over.

687
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:56,048
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

688
00:33:56,173 --> 00:34:00,079
I've got to have one hand free
to do this. Ask Tanner to do it.

689
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:02,566
- He says he has a bad wing.
- What does that mean?

690
00:34:02,691 --> 00:34:04,917
I don't know!
I don't speak salty fisherman.

691
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:08,219
- What's going on down here?
- We're right over the reef.

692
00:34:08,344 --> 00:34:09,881
I need more, psychic.

693
00:34:10,527 --> 00:34:12,480
I need... quiet...

694
00:34:13,266 --> 00:34:14,456
is what I need.

695
00:34:14,581 --> 00:34:16,804
Is there a bed in there
that I can lay down on

696
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,972
and a pillow that
doesn't smell like fish?

697
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:20,974
What the...

698
00:34:22,516 --> 00:34:24,061
I'll need a little boy's room.

699
00:34:39,939 --> 00:34:41,453
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, Dad, help me.</i>

700
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:45,158
- I need the number for the doctor lady.
- Shawn, what are you doing?

701
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:46,283
<i>Nothing.</i>

702
00:34:47,371 --> 00:34:50,922
Okay, fine, it,
It rhymes with pfark punting.

703
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:54,007
Please tell me that you're not
going after that shark.

704
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,551
I need to talk her.

705
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:57,511
- Well, you can't.
- Why not?

706
00:34:57,874 --> 00:34:59,157
She's in the bathroom.

707
00:34:59,282 --> 00:35:00,882
<i>- She's there?</i>
- Yes.

708
00:35:01,709 --> 00:35:03,959
Of course she is.
Fine. It's fine.

709
00:35:04,259 --> 00:35:07,354
Have her tell you through the door
where the shark is,

710
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:10,449
<i>because inside its belly is
evidence in a murder case.</i>

711
00:35:10,574 --> 00:35:13,452
- Shawn, I'm hanging up.
- No, wait a sec, Dad.

712
00:35:13,577 --> 00:35:17,080
Just tell her to give me a phrase,
just a phrase... anything.

713
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,797
<i>Something that sounds
oceanographery-ish.</i>

714
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:23,537
Dad.

715
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,165
That figures.

716
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:29,918
What do we got?
We got... We got maps,

717
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,686
charts, things with...

718
00:35:32,989 --> 00:35:34,971
Longitude and all the'tudes!

719
00:35:38,976 --> 00:35:40,804


720
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,517
Bull's-eye, bull's-eye, bull's-eye.

721
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:57,154
<i>Dante Pavan, he's an ocean
activist nut job from seattle.</i>

722
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:13,253
<i>It's jagged...
Like a tooth mark.</i>

723
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:14,982
<i>A knife would have many</i>

724
00:36:15,107 --> 00:36:17,521
<i>of the characteristics of shark teeth,
like this...</i>

725
00:36:21,566 --> 00:36:23,263
What are you still doing down...

726
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:26,307
I know who the killer is.

727
00:36:27,533 --> 00:36:29,728
- Who?
- We're on his boat.

728
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:37,667
How do you know Tanner...

729
00:36:38,384 --> 00:36:40,866
How do you know
Tanner is the killer?

730
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,076
Tanner has a stack of violation
as deep as the ocean floor.

731
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,161
Pavan was an activist, remember?

732
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,289
Tanner is just the kind of violator
that he was railing against.

733
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,874
That's circumstantial.

734
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,252
Who are you, Lassiter?
What about these?

735
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,546
- Shark-toothed knives?
- Exactly!

736
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,548
One of those could
have made that wound.

737
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,016
Wait a second...

738
00:36:59,302 --> 00:37:00,884
- Where's the medium one?
- Exactly.

739
00:37:01,661 --> 00:37:03,478
Where is the medium one?
It's missing.

740
00:37:03,603 --> 00:37:06,417
You want to know why?
Because Tanner used it to...

741
00:37:07,563 --> 00:37:08,475
kill Pavan.

742
00:37:08,705 --> 00:37:11,877
- That's nothing but a wild guess.
- It fits somehow, Gus.

743
00:37:12,002 --> 00:37:14,273
That's why Lassiter's always
a half a step behind us,

744
00:37:14,826 --> 00:37:17,681
because we follow our instincts,
and your first instinct is pure,

745
00:37:17,806 --> 00:37:19,316
and you got to grab it...

746
00:37:20,142 --> 00:37:21,224
I got him!

747
00:37:21,745 --> 00:37:23,891
I got that son of a bitch!

748
00:37:24,887 --> 00:37:27,587
Don't just stand there.
Help me haul it in!

749
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:29,705
Guster! Dynamite.

750
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,667
- Get that dynamite!
- Are you crazy? We're taking it in.

751
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:36,628
No, we're not. We're gonna destroy it
before it destroys us!

752
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:38,281
Now go!

753
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:46,597
<i>Surface tissue...
With completely different DNA.</i>

754
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:50,434
<i>Shark had this tissue wedged in his
teeth when he chomped down on this guy.</i>

755
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,477
You were the other victim.

756
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:53,777
Come again?

757
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,981
That shark took a bite out of you.

758
00:37:56,551 --> 00:37:59,733
It was your tissue weed in his teeth
with your DNA.

759
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:04,478
You've been in trouble
with various regulatory agencies

760
00:38:04,603 --> 00:38:06,325
for years, but you wouldn't change.

761
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,304
Dante Pavan tried to stop
you once and for all.

762
00:38:09,429 --> 00:38:11,644
That's why you killed
him in a struggle,

763
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:14,207
got rid of the evidence
the best way you knew how...

764
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:18,194
drawing a shark in to devour the body,
stab wound and all.

765
00:38:18,772 --> 00:38:21,924
But somehow, the shark got the knife
and a piece of you too.

766
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:27,888
When they caught that first shark,
you stole it and sliced him open...

767
00:38:28,525 --> 00:38:30,821
cause you thought the only evidence that
could bring you down

768
00:38:30,946 --> 00:38:32,271
was stuck in its belly.

769
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:36,188
But it was the wrong shark! You're not
gonna stop until you find the right one

770
00:38:37,071 --> 00:38:39,274
and get rid of the evidence
inside of him for good.

771
00:38:41,594 --> 00:38:42,776
Forget this!

772
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:48,200
What the hell are you doing, boy?

773
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:49,368
You're finished.

774
00:38:50,117 --> 00:38:52,996
I think this is gonna get messy.

775
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:57,000
- I'm the one with the knife.
- If that shark couldn't take me down,

776
00:38:57,712 --> 00:39:01,716
I don't think you and the retching
pantywaist here will...

777
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,050
That's for calling me a pantywaist.

778
00:39:06,328 --> 00:39:10,074
There's no shame in having a gag reflex.
It's a sign that i'm highly evolved.

779
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:12,599
I did a bit of research,
and what I found was...

780
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:13,767
He's out cold.

781
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:16,978
It was nice, though.

782
00:39:19,714 --> 00:39:21,942
Do you have any idea
how to drive this thing?

783
00:39:24,677 --> 00:39:26,905
Lassie. I'll be needing
a favor from you.

784
00:39:27,507 --> 00:39:31,089
Will you please make sure
that the chief gets one of these?

785
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:34,371
Of course I'll make sure
she gets one of these.

786
00:39:34,778 --> 00:39:37,940
- I promise.
- I don't write the headlines,

787
00:39:38,065 --> 00:39:40,227
but if I did,
I probably would have added

788
00:39:40,352 --> 00:39:43,080
- and does so with foppish aplomb.
- You know that's right.

789
00:39:43,205 --> 00:39:45,762
If you take time to read,
you'll see that we did you justice.

790
00:39:45,887 --> 00:39:48,969
It should effectively quash
all that detective Dipstick talk.

791
00:39:49,138 --> 00:39:51,304
Except in our office.
You wouldn't begrudge us that.

792
00:39:51,795 --> 00:39:53,445
I just wanted to say...

793
00:39:54,653 --> 00:39:56,018
You were this close, man.

794
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:59,497
You were right there at the precipice.
You were next to us.

795
00:40:00,038 --> 00:40:01,674
But you wouldn't jump.

796
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:05,680
Do these accolades feel good? Yes.
But it should be you right there with us

797
00:40:05,805 --> 00:40:07,540
- on the front page.
- Behind me.

798
00:40:07,665 --> 00:40:10,282
Right behind Gus.
Not because you're any less important.

799
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:13,827
- But because you're a little bit taller.
- And because you're less important.

800
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:16,538
You know what? The press can write
whatever they want.

801
00:40:16,971 --> 00:40:19,249
I'm over it.
Seriously, I don't want to be you,

802
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,625
not for one minute.

803
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:23,336
I don't want to throw out 5 crazy
theories just to get one right.

804
00:40:24,302 --> 00:40:27,335
I am a police detective,
and police detectives dont surmise

805
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,260
that banks are knocked over
by angry cats with laser beams.

806
00:40:30,608 --> 00:40:33,346
I never said they were angry.
They were following orders.

807
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,442
Regardless, at the end of the day,

808
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:37,976
I do good police work,
people respect me for it.

809
00:40:38,293 --> 00:40:39,853
- Name two.
- Name one.

810
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,772
If you'll excuse me, I have matters.

811
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,274
- Matters?
- Leave before I get rude.

812
00:40:45,221 --> 00:40:47,272
Come on, now.
I think we're past that.

813
00:40:47,397 --> 00:40:48,897
- Judges?
- Concur.

814
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,280
Out.

815
00:40:51,451 --> 00:40:53,786
- Bye, Lassie.
- See you later, buddy.

816
00:40:54,644 --> 00:40:55,644
Here.

817
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,092
Since when do you have a key?

818
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,469
I don't. Since when do you not lock?

819
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:15,872
I'm looking for sunscreen.
We're going out on the water,

820
00:41:15,997 --> 00:41:18,553
and I need
a little protection from the sun...

821
00:41:18,912 --> 00:41:20,143
and Kim's smile.

822
00:41:21,602 --> 00:41:23,412
Nothing less than spf 50.

823
00:41:23,537 --> 00:41:26,108
Your dad is one
silver-tongued devil, Shawn.

824
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:28,198
He most certainly is, Kim.

825
00:41:28,323 --> 00:41:30,904
I think we do have some sunscreen
in the other room, Dad.

826
00:41:31,411 --> 00:41:33,711
- I'll show you where.
- All right.

827
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,165
Let me just say...

828
00:41:41,642 --> 00:41:43,583
that I'm very happy
to see that things

829
00:41:43,995 --> 00:41:47,755
are going well with you anyour doctor
lady friend. She seems very nice.

830
00:41:47,989 --> 00:41:50,507
Looks like you have
a good thing going.

831
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:51,757
Good luck.

832
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:55,536
Well, thank you, son.
And truthfully, I do like her a lot.

833
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:59,954
But I'm not forgetting I'm a fisherman,
and there's still a lot of marlin.

834
00:42:00,353 --> 00:42:02,727
And she could lead me right to them.

835
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,521
That's crafty.

836
00:42:05,786 --> 00:42:07,354
See ya later, alligator.{\A mon avis il ne faut pas traduire,
c'est un vieux rock de Bill Halley, je dis a pour les djeuns}

837
00:42:12,737 --> 00:42:13,737
Alligator?
