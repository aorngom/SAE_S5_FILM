00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,100
foreign consulate, USA

2
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,900
would you excuse me for a moment?

3
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,900
hurry back.

4
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,000
i have the package in sight.

5
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:39,700
sarah?

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,200
sarah?

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,400
sarah, can you hear me?

8
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,300
???

9
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,700
where's mike traceur?

10
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,500
we can do this the easy way...

11
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,900
or the very, very hard way.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,600
kitt.

13
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,100
yes, michael?

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,900
sarah's not responding.

15
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,600
my sensors have picked up sarah.

16
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,100
she is in the vault room.

17
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,100
you are not in the vault room with her.

18
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,500
yeah, i got hung up.

19
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,300
michael, you have less than two minutes
to make contact, acquire the package,

20
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,700
and retrieve the files.

21
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,700
not a problem.

22
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,800
the ambassador's gonna be more
than a little upset

23
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,300
by your treatment of his guests.

24
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,400
sarah has been joined by four men,
and they are armed.

25
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,800
guys, what are we doing?

26
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,600
oh, come on, really?

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
oh!

28
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,800
kitt, get me to sarah now.

29
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,000
take the staircase on your left
for the fastest route to sarah.

30
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,300
- keep your eyes peeled, kitt.
- michael, i do not have eyes.

31
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,600
it's a figure of speech.

32
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,600
- which floor?
- basement level.

33
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,100
michael, security has discovered the loop

34
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,400
i have programmed into their surveillance
system.

35
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,000
they are moments away from detecting
the source of my tap.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,500
i'm moving as fast as i can.

37
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,000
you would probably move faster
if you ate a healthy diet,

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,700
decreased your alcohol intake,

39
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,400
and reduced the extracurricular activity
with your lady friends.

40
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,700
i might as well be dead.

41
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,700
your death will not help sarah
in her current situation.

42
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,900
where's the package?

43
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,700
i have lost contact with the package.

44
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,300
it appears to have vanished.

45
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,100
i have detected a co-opt
of the consulate security system.

46
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,400
it appears the men with sarah may have
a plan similar to ours.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,800
do we know who they are?

48
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,000
negative, michael.

49
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,800
do they have the package?

50
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,000
it does not appear so.

51
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,100
their weapons indicate they are
not consulate guards.

52
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,900
if they don't have the package,
then they're after the files.

53
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,400
michael, sarah has the files.

54
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,200
i know. that means they have sarah.

55
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,900
you must have a very high opinion
of mike traceur

56
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,300
if you're willing to risk the amount
of pain i'm about to inflict upon you.

57
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,300
he would do the same for me.

58
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,900
you have no idea who he is, do you?

59
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,400
michael, sarah's heart rate
and respiration have suddenly increased.

60
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,700
they are rising rapidly.

61
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,000
last chance.

62
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,400
where's mike traceur?

63
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,500
michael, you have turned the wrong way.

64
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,000
right, not left.

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
you said left.

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,800
no, michael, i said left, left, right,
left, right, left.

67
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,200
dude, you're confusing me!

68
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,200
- please remain calm.
- i am calm!

69
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,600
my surveillance tap has been detected.

70
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,300
security knows we are here.

71
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,700
go, go, go!

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,200
there are consulate guards moving in
on you from every direction.

73
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,000
and two armed men outside the vault room.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
a little late, kitt.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,100
stay where you are.

76
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,200
michael, i am being detained.

77
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,100
hey, well, get undetained.

78
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,200
hey, guys.

79
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,700
do you know where the bathroom is?

80
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,200
'cause i gotta pee.

81
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,100
please step away from the car,

82
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,500
or i will be forced to take defensive
measures.

83
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,900
dude, the car's talking to us.

84
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,800
big deal. my car talks to me.

85
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,000
it's called gps.

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,700
yes, but can your car do this?

87
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,000
yes, but can your car do this?
ATTACK MODE

88
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,000
TURBO BOOST

89
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,100
michael, sarah is in distress.

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,100
check the door.

91
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,100
i see you still have your reflexes,
traceur.

92
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,200
who the hell are you?

93
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,700
i hate needles.

94
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,000
what was that for?

95
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,300
'cause i thought i was gonna die.

96
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,000
kitt, where are you?

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,700
but...

98
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,600
i am almost at your location, sarah,
but i have attracted some attention.

99
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,800
i suggest you and michael get to the
rendezvous point as quickly as possible.

100
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,200
come on.

101
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,700
the guy with the syringe kept asking
for mike traceur.

102
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,800
they weren't after the files?

103
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,300
no, no, i've got the files.

104
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,500
they were after you.

105
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,100
clear.

106
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,700
give me your hand.

107
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,300
kitt, there's no time for you to stop.

108
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,900
now would be a good time to use
the new program i uploaded.

109
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,600
wait, what new program?

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,800
that one.

111
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,000
how did he do that?

112
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,900
mike, you really should pay attention
in the briefings.

113
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,800
sarah is right, michael. you should.

114
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,600
prepare for transformation.

115
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,200
transformation complete.

116
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,300
occupant restraint system active.

117
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,300
kitt, were you able to identify
the men in the vault room?

118
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,500
i was not, sarah.

119
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,200
whoever they were,

120
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,000
they were very good at getting in
and getting out without being seen.

121
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,800
what about the package?

122
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,200
my sensors are unable to penetrate
to that depth,

123
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,400
but the only way out undetected
is through one of

124
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,700
the underground passageways beneath
the consulate.

125
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,000
you lost the package?

126
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,900
"lost" is such a harsh word.

127
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,800
michael, sarah, we have a problem.

128
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,000
what kind of problem?

129
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,800
that kind of problem.

130
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,300
- impact in 30 seconds.
- deploy flares.

131
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,000
29...

132
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,300
kitt, stop the countdown and deploy
the damn flares.

133
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,700
- michael, deploying flares--
- kitt, deploy the flares!

134
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,000
deploying flares.

135
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,600
flares are ineffective, michael.

136
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,700
as i was trying to tell you,i cooled my
heat signature to ambient air temperature.

137
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,900
the missile is not homing in on me,
michael.

138
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,400
it is homing in on you.

139
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,300
what do you want me to do, get out?

140
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,100
that would be a fatal error, michael.

141
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,000
my sensors indicate something unusual
about this warhead.

142
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,200
i may not be programmed
to respond correctly.

143
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,600
what does he mean "respond correctly?"

144
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,800
please remain calm.

145
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,100
i have relayed our situation
to dr. Graiman.

146
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,900
i am certain he is working on a solution
as we speak.

147
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,900
emergency.

148
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,400
missile is locked on target.
???

149
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,200
there is no solution.

150
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,900
missile impact in 20 seconds.

151
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,800
19, 18, 17, 16...

152
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
this just got interesting.

153
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,100
13, 12, 11,

154
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,200
10, 9, 8,

155
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,600
7, 6, 5, 4...

156
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,800
- prepare for impact.
- 3, 2, 1...

1
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,700
kitt, it's getting hot in here.

2
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,500
kitt diverted just enough power
at exactly the right moment

3
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,100
to withstand that missile.

4
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,300
he's learning.

5
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,100
just like he's supposed to.

6
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,400
the explosive material in the missile
has attached itself to my outer skin.

7
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,500
- shed it.
- i cannot.

8
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,300
analyze it.

9
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,700
i appears to be an advanced form of napalm
with chemical attributes similar

10
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,800
to that of rocket fuel.

11
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,400
- how do we put it out?
- we do not.

12
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,900
we have to wait for it to burn out.

13
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,300
kitt, the chances of mike and i surviving
the rising temperature--

14
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,900
are 1 in 997,000.

15
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,600
that is so not good.

16
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,900
i have diverted 60% of my power
to cooling,

17
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,700
but i am afraid it is not as effective
as i had hoped.

18
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,700
worst case scenario, kitt?

19
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,000
when the temperature reaches 212 degrees,

20
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,600
you will be boiled alive in your
own bodily fluids.

21
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,300
best case scenario?

22
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,700
you will be unconscious before it happens.

23
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,400
we need the files they retrieved.

24
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,300
look, this isn't a zip drive, alex.

25
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,700
those are massive encrypted files.

26
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,200
now uploading now would drain the power

27
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,600
from the systems keeping sarah
and mike alive.

28
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,600
they lost the package, charles.

29
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,200
if it falls into the wrong hands,

30
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,400
every file we have will be compromised,

31
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,200
including the list of our undercover
operatives.

32
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,200
- if we lose the files too--
- that's my daughter in there.

33
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,600
i know, charles.

34
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,800
i know.

35
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,200
but they have to upload the files.

36
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,000
billy!

37
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,400
open a line to sarah.

38
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,800
zoe, get me a secure line with israeli
intelligence.

39
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,400
???

40
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,500
- dad.
- sarah, we need you to upload the files.

41
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,500
dr. Graiman, diverting even the smallest
amount of power at this time

42
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,700
will cause a substantial increase
in internal temperature.

43
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,300
kitt, turn off all unnecessary systems.

44
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,600
billy, figure out how to put out
this damn fire.

45
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,500
initiating simulation.

46
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,700
initiating simulation.

47
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,800
oh, god, don't get any ideas.

48
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,700
me? You're the one who just locked lips.

49
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,600
it was the heat of the moment, mike.

50
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,400
i suggest you take off your clothes.

51
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,100
okay.

52
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,500
our bodies can't withstand the excessive
temperature.

53
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,500
you're right.

54
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,900
sarah is correct, michael.

55
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,600
removing your clothes will reduce your
core temperature,

56
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,700
- thereby delaying your death.
- oh.

57
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,300
michael, please be careful as you disrobe.

58
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,100
your arm is coming perilously close
to the window control.

59
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,100
if you open the window,
you will both be instantly incinerated.

60
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,600
like i'm trying to get us killed.

61
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,700
i suggest you both refrain from speaking
unnecessarily

62
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,900
as your oxen supply is running low.

63
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,200
oxygen supply at 50%.

64
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,700
fire neutralizing.

65
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,500
simulation complete.

66
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,500
billy, what do you got?

67
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,300
we need kitt to increase his speed.

68
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,900
if he hits 377 miles per hour,
the fire will be neutralized.

69
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,600
how close are we gonna cut it?

70
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,400
within seconds of their lives.

71
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,500
kitt, you need to increase your speed.

72
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,900
increasing my speed while uploading the
encrypted files

73
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,100
will drain power necessary to keep sarah
and michael alive.

74
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,100
yeah, not a good idea.

75
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,500
billy has a plan.

76
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,700
- billy?
- billy?

77
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,900
thanks for the vote of confidence.

78
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,300
sure hope it works,
because if it doesn't...

79
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,400
we've never hit speeds that high before,
even in attack mode.

80
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,000
oxygen supply at 20%.

81
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,900
- it shoulda worked.
- billy, it's not working.

82
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,200
it should've worked, unless--

83
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,700
unless the chemical compound
is fusing with kitt's bio material,

84
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,400
causing a molecular reassembly.

85
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,900
bring 'em in hot.

86
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,500
that fire gets close to the weapons room,
we're all dead.

87
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,400
if we bring 'em in in the middle
of an uncontrollable molecular reassembly,

88
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,500
we're worse than dead.

89
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,500
we'll bring 'em into the tunnel.

90
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,800
we'll shut the emergency doors,
suck out all the air.

91
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,800
without oxygen, the fire can't breathe.

92
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,300
without oxygen, they can't breathe either.

93
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,400
kitt, we're bringing you in hot.

94
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,200
affirmative, dr. Graiman.

95
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,300
michael, sarah?

96
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,500
dr. Graiman, michael and sarah have
lost consciousness.

97
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,200
how close are they?

98
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,300
kitt's current speed, they'll be
in the tunnel in 15 seconds.

99
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,000
put medical and fire teams on alert.

100
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,900
all medical and fire personnel report
to the ssc immediately.

101
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,300
dr. Graiman, as fbi agent in charge,

102
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,700
i cannot allow you to bypass security
protocol.

103
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,200
then sarah and michael die.

104
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,600
carrie, we don't have time for this.

105
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,900
please.

106
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,300
bypass security protocol alpha delta
5-7-3.

107
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,900
security bypassed.

108
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,000
emergency hangar doors open.

109
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,400
re-entry unstable.

110
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,800
emergency procedures in effect.

111
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,700
warning.

112
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,400
molecular reassembly in progress.

113
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,100
excessive heat.

114
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,100
dr. Graiman, michael and sarah have
no oxygen.

115
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,500
please open the door.

116
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,300
billy, there's no oxygen in that tunnel.

117
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,500
- you need to open the doors now.
- working on it.

118
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,400
we do not have time for you to work
on it, billy.

119
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,000
michael and sarah will die without
oxygen immediately.

120
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,100
i am coming in. please open the door.

121
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,900
molecular reassembly halted.

122
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,300
impact imminent.

123
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,900
billy, open the damn doors!

124
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,000
i can't override the emergency system.

125
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,200
billy, if the door's not opened
immediately, i will crash into it.

126
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,600
billy!

127
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,400
3, 2, 1.

128
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,500
impact averted.

129
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,200
oxygen supply--

130
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,200
??? moving in.

131
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,800
let's cool it off first.

132
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,300
that was awesome.

133
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,200
zoe, i believe that "awesome" is not the
appropriate word for this situation.

134
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,600
deep breaths. deep breaths.

135
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,000
kitt, are you okay?

136
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,900
i am fine, sarah. are you okay?

137
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,700
i was worried about you and michael.

138
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,000
you were worried about us?

139
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,800
yes.

140
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,600
you're a computer, kitt. you can't worry.

141
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,200
artificial intelligence, michael.
there is a difference.

142
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,300
i have run it through my database
several times.

143
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,300
i believe "worry" is the appropriate word.

144
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,400
can i get some clothes here?

145
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,100
i'm fine. i'm fine.

146
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,500
i'm okay.

147
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,100
are you all right? how do you feel?

148
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,600
- not too fast.
- i got it. i got it.

149
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,500
- you all right?
- yeah.

150
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,600
- i'm fine.
- come on.

151
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,900
billy, once i complete my system
diagnostics,

152
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,500
i will point out where you went wrong
in your calculations.

153
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,900
thank you, kitt.

154
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,400
owned.

155
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,500
listen, zoe,

156
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,500
i have advanced degrees in applied
physics, quantum physics,

157
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,500
electrical and mechanical engineering,

158
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,000
chemistry, as well as discrete
and applied mathematics.

159
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,700
and i speak nine languages.

160
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,900
we should make a baby.

161
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,300
- really?
- no.

162
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,000
oh-- oh--oh--

163
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,100
the mission was compromised.

164
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,700
the mission was compromised because you
hit on every woman in the consulate.

165
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,800
i was undercover.

166
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,000
as what, a pimp?

167
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,300
four men were waiting in the vault room
and they asked for me by name.

168
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,100
- who were they?
- i have no idea.

169
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,900
they weren't after the package or the
files, but they knew i would be there.

170
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,500
are you implying that we have a leak?

171
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,200
they knew exactly when we'd be there.

172
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,800
- don't go there, mike.
- the fbi's here to protect--

173
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,200
- do not tell me how to do my job!
- then do your damn job, carrie.

174
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,500
sarah almost died.

175
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,900
sarah was trained just like everyone else.

176
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,600
i don't want her in the field anymore.
it's too dangerous.

177
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
not your call.

178
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,500
we'll do the rest of kitt's repairs
on the plane.

179
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,400
just got word the package is on the move.

180
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,100
yeah?

181
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,200
well, i thought maybe i'd grab a beer.

182
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,800
replenish some of those fluids i lost
from almost boiling to death.

183
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,800
you lost the package, mike.

184
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,800
wheels up in 15 minutes.

185
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,100
we have a problem with mike.

186
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,800
what kind of problem?

187
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
take care of it.

188
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,800
hello, michael.

189
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,100
sorry, i didn't know you were in here.

190
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,300
it's okay.

191
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,300
it's not like you haven't seen it before.

192
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,700
hey, mike...

193
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,600
those men from the vault room.

194
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,600
they know you from iraq, don't they?

195
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,500
they didn't have very flattering things
to say about you.

196
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,000
sarah, there are things that i don't
remember.

197
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,800
you don't remember?

198
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,900
or you don't want to remember?

199
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,300
lieutenant traceur!

200
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,400
you can't keep it all bottled up, mike.

201
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,600
i'm just...

202
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,600
it's just what?

203
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,300
what are you afraid of?

204
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,000
what you did...

205
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,400
or what you're capable of doing?

206
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,200
both.

1
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,900
TOP secret clearance only

2
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,800
so where's the package?

3
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,500
???

4
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,300
sarah programmed the locator coordinates
provided

5
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,700
by israeli intelligence into kitt.

6
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,200
get the package and get back
to the plane asap.

7
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,400
and how do i know someone won't be waiting
there to kill me?

8
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,200
you don't.

9
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:01,700
great.

10
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,300
kitt, you sure you don't have anything
on the men from the vault room?

11
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,800
as i told sarah at the time,

12
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,700
whoever they were,

13
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,600
they were very good at getting in
and getting out without being seen.

14
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,600
yeah,

15
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,600
like they knew exactly where they
were going.

16
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,900
there is no evidence of a leak, michael.

17
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,600
well, something's going on.

18
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,900
to alleviate your concern,

19
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,000
i will check the files of everyone working
in knight industries' research

20
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,500
and development department.

21
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,300
wait a minute, kitt. what are you saying?

22
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,200
the two people directly responsible for
the safety and security of this project

23
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,100
are the obvious suspects if our missions
are being compromised.

24
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,700
no way.

25
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,600
just because they are your friends does
not mean they are not capable of deceit.

26
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,300
the data i am accessing suggests that
it is a very common human trait.

27
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,400
many high level government officials
use deceit on a daily basis

28
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,900
and still remain in office.

29
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,400
most of alex torres' files are classified,

30
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,300
indicating he may have something to hide.

31
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,300
kitt, i have classified files.

32
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,100
are you hiding something, michael?

33
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,300
may i ask you a question?

34
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,300
that depends on the question.

35
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,700
what exactly is your relationship
with sarah?

36
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,800
you dated before you joined the military,

37
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,000
and you obviously still care deeply
for her.

38
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,600
sarah and i are just friends, kitt.

39
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,600
then why do your hormone levels rise
when you are around each other?

40
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,800
i have also detected a release
of pheromones

41
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,800
- and other signs of sexual arousal.
- whoa, kitt! way too personal.

42
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,400
i wish you wouldn't do that.

43
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,900
we have arrived at the location
of the package.

44
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,600
my scanners are picking up a man hiding
under the bridge,

45
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,400
and there is no sign of the package.

46
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,000
please be careful, michael.

47
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,700
don't move.

48
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,000
please don't shoot.

49
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
turn around.

50
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,700
where's the package?

51
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,000
i'm the package.

52
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,000
well, not all of me. just some of me.

53
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,100
let's get out of here. come on.

54
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,900
what did you expect,
a briefcase full of plutonium?

55
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,100
yeah, kind of.

56
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,600
michael, a car is rapidly approaching.

57
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:27,700
who's that?

58
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,200
michael.

59
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,000
michael traceur.

60
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,900
oh, my god.

61
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,100
it is you.

62
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,700
i'm sorry. do i know you?

63
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,000
you know me all right.

64
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,900
no te recuerdas?

65
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,200
get in the car now!

66
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,800
uh-uh.

67
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,000
you remember me now?

68
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,900
only reason why i don't kill you
is 'cause i owe you.

69
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,900
consider us even.

70
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,800
okay, papito?

71
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,400
why'd she call him "papito"?

72
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,600
what does that mean?

73
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,600
"tiny father," but that's not
how she said it.

74
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,700
that was sexual.
more like, "who's your daddy?"

75
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,000
you really do not know who this woman is?

76
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,400
never seen her before in my life.

77
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,500
but you have the same tattoo.

78
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,700
it's a military tattoo.

79
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,700
a lot of people who served in special
forces have them.

80
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,200
there is nothing in any known database
on her.

81
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,800
cross-reference her with the men
from the consulate last night.

82
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,800
i still do not have enough information
to identify the men at the consulate.

83
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,200
she's the second person i've never met
in the last eight hours

84
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,400
who claims they know me.

85
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,100
kitt, cross-reference her with me.

86
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,800
michael, even with my clearance,

87
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,900
i cannot access your classified military
files.

88
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,900
stop.

89
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,400
where's this footage from?

90
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,300
beirut, lebanon.

91
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,400
i've never been to beirut.

92
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,200
the footage does not appear
to have been altered.

93
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,900
i believe you, or someone who looks
just like you,

94
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,400
was in beirut with this woman
on the date indicated.

95
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,700
something's not right.

96
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,800
billy, open a chat line.

97
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,500
who the hell is she?

98
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,000
looks like we got us a little tongue
action.

99
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,800
muy caliente!

100
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,400
ixnay on the surveillance footage-a.

101
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,300
michael, why are you speaking pig latin
incorrectly?

102
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,000
just turn it off, please.

103
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,300
i have no idea who she is.

104
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,900
the package is vital to national security,
mike.

105
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,000
get it back.

106
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,200
yes, sir.

107
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,500
kitt, i need to speak with sarah
in private.

108
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,400
Michael ???

109
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,300
- hello, sarah.
- cut the music.

110
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,500
sarah, after i shipped out to iraq,
when i stopped calling you,

111
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,800
did i give you a reason why?

112
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,700
you remember that you stopped calling,
but you don't remember why?

113
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,500
no.

114
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,900
all right, then...

115
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,100
let me jar your memory for you, mike.

116
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,500
you called me from a classified location.

117
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,300
you wouldn't say where.

118
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,800
you asked me to marry you.

119
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,000
and i said yes.

120
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
and then you disappeared for three years.

121
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,600
i thought you were dead.

122
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,900
i asked you to marry me?

123
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,900
and the day you asked me is the same date

124
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,900
that's on the surveillance footage of you
in beirut.

125
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,800
sarah, i have never been to beirut.

126
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,500
what's going on, mike?

127
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,400
i gotta go.

128
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,400
it is possible something traumatic
happened

129
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,200
and you are repressing your memories,

130
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,900
or you have dissociative identity
disorder,

131
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,200
also known as multiple personality
disorder.

132
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,900
or someone doesn't want me to remember.

133
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,200
in re-examining your military files,

134
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,000
i find that there are many gaps.

135
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,700
you seem to have disappeared for weeks,
sometimes months, at a time.

136
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:22,100
mike, did you have anything to do
with an operation secure freedom?

137
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,700
operation secure freedom is one
of your many files

138
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,500
i was denied access to, michael.

139
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,900
the men at the consulate who tried
to kill you

140
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,200
were all involved in the same black op.

141
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,100
you okay?

142
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,900
dad, something's wrong with mike.

143
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,100
what are you talking about?

144
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,700
something happened to him in iraq.

145
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,200
things happen in war, sarah.

146
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
things men don't want to talk about.

147
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,000
no, something else. something different.

148
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,700
something very bad.

149
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,800
michael, why did you disconnect agent
rivai?

150
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,300
kitt, i need to see inside that car.

151
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,700
i believe you are either repressing your
memories

152
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,400
or you are not being honest about them.

153
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,000
kitt, when humans keep changing
the subject,

154
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,900
that means they don't want to talk
about it.

155
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,300
there are some things i remember
and some things i don't.

156
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,600
but right now, i need to see inside
that car.

157
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,400
using the signal from her gps,

158
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,500
i may be able to track and follow her
using real-time satellite surveillance.

159
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,500
can you zoom in and enhance?

160
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,800
boost and redirect your parabolic mics.

161
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,500
boosting and redirecting.

162
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,700
hey, hey!

163
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,400
you shaved your head?

164
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,600
my entire body.

165
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,800
a single strand of my hair
is worth millions.

166
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,000
look, fake eyebrows and eyelashes.

167
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,700
i also exfoliate every four hours,
so there's no way you can get a sample.

168
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,700
wanna bet?

169
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,900
what are you doing? hey, hey!

170
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,500
- oh, my god!
- did she just chop off his thumb?

171
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,600
it appears she did.

172
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,500
oh, i think i'm gonna hurl.

1
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,900
yep.

2
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,000
???

3
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,300
gotta get my thumb back. come on, come on.

4
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,900
we gotta get my thumb back.

5
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,600
mike, you have to get his thumb back
at all costs.

6
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,100
kitt, plot an intercept.

7
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,400
intercept plotted.

8
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,500
we're gonna need a little first aid.

9
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,300
accessing first aid data.

10
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,800
hey, what are you doing? ow!

11
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,800
ow! Aah!

12
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,200
i think i'm gonna pass out.

13
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,400
really?

14
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,300
yeah.

15
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,600
awesome.

16
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
what the--

17
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,100
ow! Ow! God!

18
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,400
first aid complete.

19
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,600
for a follow up, please see your personal
physician within the next 24 hours.

20
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,700
it doesn't hurt anymore.

21
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,100
can the people you're talking to hear
and see everything inside this car?

22
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,100
yes.

23
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,900
kitt, shut off all contact with the ssc.

24
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,500
- but, michael--
- just do it.

25
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,000
going offline.

26
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,400
get audio and visual back up.

27
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,500
there's no way to override.

28
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,500
that would defeat the purpose
of artificial intelligence.

29
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,900
okay, they can't hear or see us,
and please don't tell me you know me.

30
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,500
no, but i know the people you work for,

31
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,300
and they are gonna dissect me
then put me under a microscope.

32
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,200
what are you talking about?

33
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,300
i'm the cipher.

34
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,500
cipher for what?

35
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,000
an unbreakable code.

36
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,400
my dna is the key.

37
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,400
your dna is a key to decipher a code?

38
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,200
not just a code. the ultimate code.

39
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,300
and hidden in my dna is the ultimate
cipher.

40
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,400
hidden in your dna.

41
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,600
i hid it there.

42
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,400
i'm the one who invented the code.

43
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,500
you invented an unbreakable code
and hid the key to it in your dna?

44
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,100
yeah.

45
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,700
dude, that is so stupid.

46
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,600
yeah.

47
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,900
michael, i am no longer able to track her.

48
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,500
she's in the subway, kitt.

49
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,500
attack mode.

50
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,800
- initiating transformation.
- what's attack mod-oh-oh-oh!

51
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,600
transformation complete.

52
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,900
Metro ???

53
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,000
michael, the shortest route takes us
directly onto--

54
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,200
i know, just do it.

55
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,700
i have tapped into the metro surveillance
system and located her.

56
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,800
she appears to be meeting the blond man
 with the black leather jacket.

57
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,200
we have a three-minute window before
another train is due,

58
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,200
- if the trains are on schedule.
- "if."

59
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,300
oh!

60
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,100
exiting the vehicle at this time
will result in your death.

61
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,400
look, i was joking.

62
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,500
the dna, the cipher for top secret codes.

63
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,000
i mean, who'd fall for that?

64
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,100
APPROACHING SUBWAY TUNNEL

65
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,400
APPROACHING SUBWAY TUNNEL
whoa-oh!

66
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,800
whoa-oh!

67
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,200
please move to the center of the car.

68
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,500
step back to allow the doors to close.

69
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,400
oh!

70
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,800
step back to allow the doors to close.

71
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,600
excuse me.

72
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,400
who are you?

73
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,600
you know who i am.

74
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,600
where did we meet?

75
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,600
beirut.

76
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,800
i've never been to beirut.

77
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,700
dios mio.

78
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,700
you really don't remember, do you?

79
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,400
i have no idea who you are.

80
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,300
what did they do to you, mike?

81
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,100
who's they?

82
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,800
fbi, freeze!

83
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,900
everybody down! nobody move!

84
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,800
mike!

85
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,100
what the hell just happened?

86
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,100
???

87
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,600
SOMEWHERE ???

88
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,000
it was a problem, and i took care of it.

89
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,400
what did you do to me?

90
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,200
not you. mike traceur.

91
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,500
what?

92
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,200
i killed mike traceur.

93
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,000
the shooting victim was believed
to be disgruntled iraq war

94
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,600
- vet michael traceur...
- what the hell did you do?

95
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,500
i did what i felt was in the best
interests of this project.

96
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,700
and if i don't want to be dead?

97
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,100
your past has come back to haunt you,
mike.

98
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,300
if people are looking for you,
you put all of us at risk.

99
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,100
did you read it?

100
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,400
yeah, i read it.

101
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,500
it's incomplete, but now that you're dead,

102
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,800
maybe you can find out what really
happened.

103
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,300
the woman in the subway. who is she?

104
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,600
i have no idea.

105
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,400
it's like she doesn't exist.

106
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,000
where are we headed, michael?

107
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,000
if you plan on running away with me,

108
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,600
i must inform you i am the legal property
of knight industries.

109
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,600
if you continue at this speed
for no apparent reason,

110
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,000
i will be forced to take control
of the vehicle.

111
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,500
i'm going home, kitt.

112
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,800
there is nothing at your former home,
michael.

113
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,700
the fbi has already been there.

114
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,800
mike traceur is legally dead.

115
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,700
i can't be declared dead without a body.

116
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,600
a body was provided.

117
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,100
whose body?

118
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,400
i am sorry, michael,

119
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,300
i do not have that information.

120
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,800
it does not seem logical
to be upset about the situation.

121
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,900
if mike traceur is dead, your past can
no longer come back to haunt you,

122
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,200
or endanger sarah,

123
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,400
which i believe is what is preventing you
from becoming close to her again.

124
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,900
my past will always haunt me, kitt.

125
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,500
katie.

126
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,800
driving it in.

127
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,100
heads up!

128
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,600
billy morgan--oh.

129
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,600
dead man walking.

130
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,500
have you seen sarah?

131
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,200
uh, not since carrie shot you
with elephant tranquilizer.

132
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,900
you okay?

133
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,000
for a guy whose existence has just
been wiped off the face of the earth,

134
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,200
yeah, i'm...

135
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
okay.

136
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,900
some people would love the opportunity
to start again.

137
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,000
i mean,

138
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,100
the chance to negate the everyday
humiliation beating on your soul

139
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,000
like a drum from hell?

140
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,200
i'm saying i think it would be super
cool to be able to start again.

141
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,000
you want to go home with me tonight?

142
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
you're just screwing with me again.

143
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,200
aren't you?

144
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,900
i don't know. am i?

145
00:38:59,100 --> 00:38:59,800
oh...

146
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,800
you need to come up with a new name.

147
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,000
or the fbi can come up with one for you.

148
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,300
what about buster?

149
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,600
my father's real name was michael long.

150
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,100
mike long?

151
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,000
sounds like a porn star.

152
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,600
total porn name.

153
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,200
zoe che, phone call.

154
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,900
how would you know?

155
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,700
i watch a ton of porn.

156
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,500
knight industries research
and development. zoe speaking.

157
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,900
what did you do with the rest of him?

158
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,900
witness protection.

159
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,100
we can't have his dna fall
into the wrong hands.

160
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,800
yeah, right.

161
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,500
you know,

162
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,400
one day mike is gonna remember everything.

163
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,700
and when he does,
he's gonna come after you.

164
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,200
well, then...

165
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,100
we just have to make sure he never
remembers.

166
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,900
hello, michael.

167
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,100
sarah's pre-set music and mood lighting
are active.

168
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
i don't remember what happened to me,
sarah.

169
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,600
and i don't know why i don't remember,
but i would never do anything to hurt you.

170
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,100
i'm sorry that i did.

171
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,900
it's not your fault you don't remember.

172
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,400
you want to grab a beer?

173
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,800
we've gone down this road before, mike.

174
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,300
how about we start fresh?

175
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,300
i'm michael knight.

176
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,200
sarah graiman.

177
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,900
so what's your sign, michael knight?

178
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,100
not quite sure yet.

179
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,100
??

180
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,000
they make a handsome couple.
