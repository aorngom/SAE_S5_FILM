1
00:00:56,225 --> 00:00:58,040
I suppose I should just
come quietly?

2
00:01:17,768 --> 00:01:18,768
No!

3
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:21,204
No, please, no.

4
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:25,799
You know what he'll do to me.

5
00:01:38,589 --> 00:01:40,760
Robin Hood.
The pleasure's all yours.

6
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:43,640
I think it's time you were
on your way.

7
00:01:43,924 --> 00:01:44,924
Now!

8
00:01:49,713 --> 00:01:51,160
Here, allow me.

9
00:01:53,273 --> 00:01:54,280
Here.

10
00:02:01,513 --> 00:02:02,721
So, tell me,

11
00:02:04,287 --> 00:02:07,748
why would two of Squire Thornton's men
pursue you all the way from Shrewsbury?

12
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:11,739
It wasn't for me. They were
in pursuit of my mistress.

13
00:02:13,077 --> 00:02:14,120
Your mistress?

14
00:02:15,058 --> 00:02:18,165
{\Well, }I would hardly be much of a decoy
in my maid's apron.

15
00:02:18,285 --> 00:02:19,840
I was helping her escape.

16
00:02:20,172 --> 00:02:22,599
- Escape from what?
- Her marriage.

17
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,730
But the Squire sent men after her.

18
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,080
You know, some might
consider that an act of love.{\ wouldn't they?}

19
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,878
Squire Thornton has never
loved my mistress!

20
00:02:30,998 --> 00:02:34,398
If you'll excuse me, my mistress
awaits me in Nottingham.

21
00:02:35,986 --> 00:02:37,079
All right.

22
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,283
You can't just go to Nottingham alone,
it's too dangerous.

23
00:02:40,403 --> 00:02:42,813
I'll take you there... safely.

24
00:02:43,546 --> 00:02:45,040
If you tell me your name.

25
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,910
Isabella.

26
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,640
Will it be necessary for us
to hold hands throughout?

27
00:02:56,157 --> 00:02:57,514
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:59,697 --> 00:03:03,097
In all seriousness, I would like
the use of my other arm.

29
00:03:03,511 --> 00:03:05,480
Come here quick! Quick!

30
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,735
Come here, come here.

31
00:03:14,578 --> 00:03:16,600
We're close, keep moving.

32
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:31,599
He's back.

00:03:34,094 --> 00:03:37,271

Episode Five
LETS THE GAMES COMMENCE

36
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,061
<i>Keep together, lads. Move slowly.</i>

37
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,479
<i>Slowly forward. Tighter!</i>

38
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:22,323
<i>Move smoothly.</i>

39
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,959
<i>Right, come on!</i>

40
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:30,279
<i>- Put some energy into it!
- Shields higher!</i>

41
00:04:31,068 --> 00:04:32,200
<i>And now!</i>

42
00:04:36,253 --> 00:04:38,320
<i>Move it closer together.</i>

43
00:04:59,552 --> 00:05:01,282
You're still alive.

44
00:05:01,622 --> 00:05:03,922
Things must have gone well at court.

45
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:07,595
Well, they can't have
gone that badly,

46
00:05:07,715 --> 00:05:10,760
not for Prince John to provide you
with men, horses...

47
00:05:11,064 --> 00:05:12,164
Necessities.

48
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:15,611
So Prince John sent you back
to Nottingham with a mission,

49
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:17,931
and yet nobody saw fit to tell me.

50
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:21,080
The last time I checked,
I was still the Sheriff.

51
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,110
The Prince is still waiting
for his thousand crowns.

52
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,945
- His patience wears thin.
- Protect yourself! Come on!

53
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:29,219
As indeed does mine.
What's the mission?

54
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:30,992
He wants me to kill Robin Hood.

55
00:05:31,112 --> 00:05:32,760
Oh, I'm sure he does.

56
00:05:34,855 --> 00:05:37,200
But you've... never
managed it before, Gisborne.

57
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,960
Although you did{\ once} have him
at your sword point!

58
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:42,800
- Yet still he bested you.
- This time will be different.

59
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:47,119
I will command without incompetent,
ill-conceived interference from others.

60
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:49,748
No. You will fail, as before,

61
00:05:49,868 --> 00:05:52,080
and {\then }you will be back,
and beg me for my patronage.

62
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,440
Not this time.

63
00:05:54,055 --> 00:05:56,662
The Prince's furnished me with a weapon
that not even Hood can escape.

64
00:05:56,782 --> 00:05:58,039
What weapon?

65
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,412
I will not have need of you...

66
00:06:00,532 --> 00:06:01,760
ever again.

67
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,290
All I'm saying is, I shot them.

68
00:06:10,626 --> 00:06:13,876
It would be nice if someone else
offered to cook them.

69
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:16,880
Don't look at me.
Just because I'm the girl.

70
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,920
Oh, I think it's established
Much is the girl around here.

71
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,101
Hang on, Allan. What is this about?

72
00:06:22,221 --> 00:06:26,220
- I am a man in mind and body.
- Yeah? Prove it.

73
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:28,600
- Robin!
- Turn back, we've got company.

74
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,147
- So I see.
- No,

75
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:32,280
our old friend is back
from the Prince's court.

76
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,600
- What? I thought he was dead!
- So what's the reason for her?

77
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,812
- Come on, this way!
- Go, go!

78
00:06:43,245 --> 00:06:45,574
What are we doing?
We can't outrun them!

79
00:06:45,694 --> 00:06:46,919
Don't worry,

80
00:06:47,316 --> 00:06:48,640
we're not going to.

81
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,240
Follow me!

82
00:06:52,396 --> 00:06:53,686
Hold on.

83
00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:56,999
- We can't!
- Yes, we can, jump!

84
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:09,176
Quickly! Come on! Come on!

85
00:07:17,322 --> 00:07:18,720
See you, Gisborne!

86
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:20,099
It's time.

87
00:07:21,313 --> 00:07:23,000
Get the weapon into position.

88
00:07:24,101 --> 00:07:25,101
Go, go!

89
00:07:31,825 --> 00:07:33,359
Come on. Come on.

90
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,470
I'll see if the road's clear.

91
00:07:49,571 --> 00:07:51,600
- No. They're closing in.
- Right,

92
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,402
we're making it too easy for them.

93
00:07:53,522 --> 00:07:55,715
- We have to split up.
- We should stick together?

94
00:07:55,835 --> 00:07:58,764
Listen to me. We've got Prince John's
Elite Guards after us.

95
00:07:58,884 --> 00:08:00,720
They're taking us seriously.

96
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,560
- I'll lead them away.
- {\ Yeah.}What?

97
00:08:03,388 --> 00:08:06,437
I'll be fine. Just go to Nottingham,
I'll meet you there.

98
00:08:06,557 --> 00:08:08,306
Get out of the forest
as quick as you can.

99
00:08:08,426 --> 00:08:10,911
- Nottingham? Are you mad?
- {\That's }The last place {\that }they'll look.

100
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:14,631
And Kate, I need you to make sure
Isabella gets there safely.

101
00:08:15,432 --> 00:08:17,142
Kate? Please?

102
00:08:17,952 --> 00:08:19,039
For me.

103
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:22,839
Good luck.

104
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,720
- Robin, wait!
- Listen, listen.

105
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,314
Kate, Isabella, go North.
Take the cliff road.

106
00:08:27,434 --> 00:08:29,586
Allan, Much, go west
through the marshes.

107
00:08:29,706 --> 00:08:33,056
- Tuck, I'll go east.
- Good man, I'll go south. Go, go!

108
00:08:33,585 --> 00:08:34,585
Follow me.

109
00:08:55,262 --> 00:08:57,960
The merchants are here,
as per your instructions.

110
00:08:58,628 --> 00:09:00,700
Yes, I can see that.
Let's get on with it.

111
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,587
Thank you for coming
at such short notice.

112
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,520
I thought we'd get
the boring business

113
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,280
of paying our taxes out of the way
nice and early this month.

114
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:17,439
Unless, of course,
anybody has a problem with that?

115
00:09:19,473 --> 00:09:21,600
Step forward with your contribution.

116
00:09:30,597 --> 00:09:33,320
Business is very slow these days,
very slow.

117
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:37,225
It must be, because you would not
short-change me, would you?

118
00:09:38,032 --> 00:09:39,032
Because?

119
00:09:39,152 --> 00:09:41,920
If you short-change the Sheriff,
you short-change Prince John.

120
00:09:43,198 --> 00:09:44,200
What was that?

121
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:53,610
You dare to cast aspersions
on my relationship with Prince John?

122
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,359
Because your fate is in my hands.

123
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,616
A word in the right ear,

124
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,971
a whisper in the right direction.

125
00:10:01,091 --> 00:10:03,800
I am still the Sheriff!

126
00:10:22,016 --> 00:10:23,116
Black Elite.

127
00:10:27,723 --> 00:10:29,273
There's more of them.

128
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:34,640
- Why aren't they attacking?
- Would you prefer if they did?

129
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,800
Let's go.

130
00:10:43,005 --> 00:10:44,043
<i>Shields!</i>

131
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,639
<i>Together!</i>

132
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,439
<i>Right, lads, shields!</i>

133
00:11:00,907 --> 00:11:02,920
Do you even know how to count?!

134
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,480
Where {\the hell }is my treasurer?

135
00:11:08,552 --> 00:11:10,279
You killed him, sir.

136
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,520
Anybody can see that
that is nowhere near enough!

137
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:18,440
Years of loyal service,

138
00:11:18,793 --> 00:11:22,193
that's worth more than coins,
and dead outlaws, isn't it?

139
00:11:22,864 --> 00:11:25,341
- Isn't it?!
- Yes, Sir. It is, Sir!

140
00:11:26,593 --> 00:11:27,843
Apparently not.

141
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,840
Very well.

142
00:11:31,064 --> 00:11:33,464
I shall pledge my allegiance
in gold.

143
00:11:36,406 --> 00:11:38,592
Come with me, bring that book.

144
00:11:40,386 --> 00:11:42,319
We're going to make money.

145
00:11:42,706 --> 00:11:45,240
<i>It's market day, Sir.
It's always congested.</i>

146
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,880
Yes. Yes, you're quite right.

147
00:11:48,298 --> 00:11:50,560
So something needs to be done.
There! You!

148
00:11:51,094 --> 00:11:52,800
Two-cow family, are we?

149
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,680
- Yes, sir.
- That'll be 2 crowns.

150
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,490
Don't just stand there{\, man}.
Take the money.

151
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,313
- Yes, sir. Two crowns.
- Stop!

152
00:11:58,433 --> 00:11:59,800
How many goats have you{\ got there}?

153
00:12:26,827 --> 00:12:27,927
Anyone hurt?

154
00:12:31,255 --> 00:12:32,119
No.

155
00:12:37,052 --> 00:12:38,152
But you are.

156
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:50,559
Does that hurt?

157
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,125
Yes.

158
00:12:59,793 --> 00:13:01,520
I thought you were being attacked.

159
00:13:02,297 --> 00:13:04,998
No, I was training my men.

160
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,879
Although watching you and Gizmo,
maybe I'm out of a job.

161
00:13:10,282 --> 00:13:12,400
- Oh, I'm sorry...
- Don't worry.

162
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,610
You've got Titus training hard.

163
00:13:16,181 --> 00:13:17,400
Bertha of Bath.

164
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,330
Of Bertha's Circus Maximus?

165
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,000
Famous from Huddersfield
to Haltemprice?

166
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:28,399
- Where've you been?
- Here mainly.

167
00:13:31,765 --> 00:13:33,511
- I gotta go.
- Why?

168
00:13:33,631 --> 00:13:36,760
That's Prince John's men.
They're looking for me.

169
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,647
Please. I'm an outlaw.

170
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,280
One of Robin Hood's men.
If they capture me...

171
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,465
Which is exactly what they will do,
if you run. Here.

172
00:13:44,585 --> 00:13:46,335
- Trust me.
- I don't...

173
00:13:50,376 --> 00:13:53,280
- This is not going to work...
- No. Keep your head down.

174
00:14:01,315 --> 00:14:03,055
How can I help you, officer?

175
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,359
Name, and purpose in this forest?

176
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,360
I see. Straight to business, is it?

177
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,280
Suit yourself.

178
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,228
I'm Bertha,
of Bertha's Circus Maximus.

179
00:14:12,348 --> 00:14:15,097
These are my gladiators,
my little band of helpers,

180
00:14:15,217 --> 00:14:17,467
and we're on our way to Nottingham.

181
00:14:26,716 --> 00:14:28,316
What's wrong with him?

182
00:14:29,386 --> 00:14:30,536
He's a leper.

183
00:14:35,465 --> 00:14:38,240
Be gone, woman. The forest is no place
for you to be today.

184
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,350
I was getting that impression already,
but thank you for the advice.

185
00:14:46,188 --> 00:14:47,560
Let's get out of here.

186
00:14:58,195 --> 00:14:59,200
All right.

187
00:15:00,883 --> 00:15:01,888
Damn.

188
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:06,377
- This is going to slow him down a bit.
- This is all we need.

189
00:15:08,726 --> 00:15:11,959
This could take a while.
Keep an eye out for company.

190
00:15:19,374 --> 00:15:21,440
- What?
- Are you a giant?

191
00:15:21,601 --> 00:15:23,384
No. Are you a gladiator?

192
00:15:29,659 --> 00:15:31,109
Are they all yours?

193
00:15:31,345 --> 00:15:32,911
Not by birth!

194
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,040
She saved us.

195
00:15:35,378 --> 00:15:37,620
- Walt, don't be silly.
- She did.

196
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,340
None of us had anyone.

197
00:15:39,482 --> 00:15:41,477
We'd have starved to death.

198
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,960
That's enough.

199
00:15:44,481 --> 00:15:47,884
I find them on my travels.
Begging or thieving.

200
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,677
I take in as many as I can.
I feed them, I clothe them.

201
00:15:50,797 --> 00:15:53,247
I'm only doing
what anyone else would.

202
00:15:53,426 --> 00:15:54,976
I wish that was true.

203
00:15:56,494 --> 00:15:58,741
- Hey, you could help us.
- How?

204
00:15:58,861 --> 00:16:01,467
When we get to Nottingham,
fight for us.

205
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:03,760
- Yeah? In the show.
- Yeah!

206
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,282
That wouldn't be helping you. That'd
just put all of you in more danger.

207
00:16:07,402 --> 00:16:11,160
We'd disguise you again.
It was you that put Gizmo out of action.

208
00:16:12,128 --> 00:16:13,166
No, I can't.

209
00:16:13,286 --> 00:16:15,480
I can't cancel the show.

210
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,750
Or if I do, it'll be a long,
cold winter for us all.

211
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,539
All right, I'll stay with you...

212
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,610
... until my friends make it
to Nottingham.

213
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,954
If my friends make it to Nottingham.

214
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:39,328
- I thought you were heading west?
- We were.

215
00:16:39,448 --> 00:16:40,960
You're meant to be heading North!

216
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,071
We're trying!
There's Black Elite at every turn!

217
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,321
There must be hundreds of men.

218
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:51,941
There are, and they seem to know
exactly where we're going.

219
00:16:53,267 --> 00:16:54,960
Or where they want us to go.

220
00:16:56,135 --> 00:16:58,728
- We've been herded.
- Like sheep.

221
00:16:58,848 --> 00:17:02,217
Like lambs... to the slaughter.
They've been tracking us.

222
00:17:02,337 --> 00:17:04,600
They've exhausted our arsenals.
I've one arrow left.

223
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,670
So how do we get out of here?

224
00:17:08,055 --> 00:17:10,360
There's only one way left to go.

225
00:17:10,756 --> 00:17:12,106
Come on, quickly.

226
00:17:18,198 --> 00:17:20,668
It's Gisborne. This way, this way.

227
00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:22,692
Where now?

228
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,200
- Come on!
- Where now?

229
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,370
- Follow me!
- Go, go, go, go!

230
00:17:43,739 --> 00:17:46,760
Looking well, Gisborne...
for a dead man.

231
00:17:48,623 --> 00:17:51,582
Be assured that your death
will be real,

232
00:17:52,702 --> 00:17:53,852
not rumoured.

233
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,918
You must have made
quite an impression on Prince John.

234
00:17:57,038 --> 00:17:58,840
A better impression than you have.

235
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:08,160
- What's he got in there?
- How should I know?

236
00:18:08,516 --> 00:18:09,720
Just ready yourself.

237
00:18:10,051 --> 00:18:12,240
How can I, {\ready myself }when I don't know
what I have to be ready for?

238
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,254
Just be ready for anything!

239
00:18:31,961 --> 00:18:34,440
- What the hell...?
- Are you ready for that?

240
00:18:34,601 --> 00:18:38,040
It's an apt way to despatch virulent
supporters of the Coeur de Lion.

241
00:18:38,536 --> 00:18:42,040
He hasn't been fed for days.
I wanted him to be ready for you!

242
00:18:59,443 --> 00:19:01,440
- Just stay together.
- Robin?

243
00:19:01,893 --> 00:19:04,119
Are you as good a shot
as they say you are?

244
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:05,740
Of course I am.

245
00:19:07,927 --> 00:19:09,108
Calm down!

246
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:11,002
- They can smell fear{\, you know}!
- Really?

247
00:19:11,122 --> 00:19:12,320
What you thinking?

248
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,560
Throw this as far away {\from us }as you can.
Robin, you hit it in the air.

249
00:19:15,943 --> 00:19:18,581
- Yeah. Tuck, can you take the other?
- Yeah.

250
00:19:18,701 --> 00:19:21,120
Everyone, cover your eyes.
Don't breathe this in.

251
00:19:21,456 --> 00:19:23,287
On three. Ready?

252
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:25,744
One... two...

253
00:19:27,088 --> 00:19:28,088
three!

254
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,160
Get it back in the damn box.

255
00:19:41,155 --> 00:19:42,499
Go, go! Run!

256
00:19:45,944 --> 00:19:47,519
<i>You men, with me.</i>

257
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,230
It must be mustard powder!***

258
00:19:53,982 --> 00:19:54,982
Nice work.

259
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,550
Wait, wait, wait!

260
00:20:08,761 --> 00:20:11,068
And where exactly does a maid
find mustard bombs?

261
00:20:11,188 --> 00:20:13,800
- Does it really matter?
- I think it does.

262
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,319
I believe the words you're looking for
are "Thank you".

263
00:20:16,439 --> 00:20:18,179
It won't be{\take} long
for Gisborne to regroup.

264
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:21,029
{\You need to }Go to the camp and rearm.
Tuck, with me.

265
00:20:21,149 --> 00:20:21,982
Yeah.

266
00:20:22,102 --> 00:20:24,167
- Where are you going?
- To Gisborne's camp.

267
00:20:24,287 --> 00:20:27,921
To see what else he's got,
to see if, and where, he's vulnerable.

268
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,641
Hang on, where's John?

269
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:33,569
Why didn't he get rounded up
with the rest of us?

270
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,920
There's two possibilities. One,
he might've made it to Nottingham...

271
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,796
- I don't want to know the other one.
- {\We should}Just go back to the camp and rearm.{\all right?}

272
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,054
- I should come with you.
- Yeah. {\I think that would be a }Good idea.

273
00:20:44,174 --> 00:20:45,272
I agree.

274
00:20:45,392 --> 00:20:47,942
The camp should be on a need-to-know
basis. You don't need to know.

275
00:20:48,062 --> 00:20:49,862
With the greatest respect.

276
00:20:50,129 --> 00:20:51,129
Settled.

277
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,679
Bertha's Circus Maximus!

278
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,640
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's your lucky day!

279
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:05,684
Bertha's Circus Maximus is in town!

280
00:21:05,938 --> 00:21:09,929
Place your bets here
to add some extra excitement.

281
00:21:16,004 --> 00:21:17,937
The ladies love him.

282
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:20,465
<i>Get going, show me your money!</i>

283
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:24,352
Bring her to see me.

284
00:21:31,472 --> 00:21:35,372
No need for that, Bertha. I don't
expect it from old acquaintances.

285
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:36,960
Vasey?

286
00:21:37,342 --> 00:21:39,603
Sheriff... Vasey.

287
00:21:39,723 --> 00:21:42,240
Let's not dispense
with all formalities.

288
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,240
Now, the last time we spoke,
I told you

289
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:48,840
that if I ever saw you in Nottingham
again, I would kill you, but...

290
00:21:50,114 --> 00:21:51,336
here you are.

291
00:21:52,067 --> 00:21:54,520
In my defence, I heard you were
no longer sheriff.

292
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,360
Why shouldn't I be?
Who told you that?

293
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,319
I was told you'd moved on
to better things.

294
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,680
Unfortunately for you, it was a lie.

295
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,406
Not so fast.

296
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:12,666
I assume you are here
to alleviate the locals of their purses?

297
00:22:12,786 --> 00:22:14,800
- I go where the audiences are
- No.

298
00:22:14,961 --> 00:22:17,998
You go where men
are prepared to gamble...

299
00:22:19,103 --> 00:22:21,240
- on your fixed fights.
- Fixed?

300
00:22:21,401 --> 00:22:23,040
My fights are for real.

301
00:22:25,893 --> 00:22:28,764
Let's not insult each other, Bertha.

302
00:22:30,297 --> 00:22:32,200
Oh, how much do you want?

303
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,338
Two hundred crowns.

304
00:22:35,462 --> 00:22:37,492
Anything else you make you can keep.

305
00:22:37,612 --> 00:22:39,987
I can't make that in a day!
There won't be anything over!

306
00:22:40,107 --> 00:22:42,108
- That's your problem.
- I can give you half.

307
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:45,193
- Then I shall only half hang you.
- Wait.

308
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:52,675
I could settle the debt with...

309
00:22:52,987 --> 00:22:54,520
something better than money.

310
00:22:57,914 --> 00:22:59,280
There's no such thing.

311
00:23:01,156 --> 00:23:03,306
What about one of Hood's outlaws?

312
00:23:05,612 --> 00:23:09,240
What if I told you I could have him
killed in your market square

313
00:23:09,401 --> 00:23:11,746
for all to see this afternoon?

314
00:23:16,626 --> 00:23:20,326
- You can really do this?
- Would it be worth a hundred crowns{\to you}?

315
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,130
Yes.

316
00:23:25,026 --> 00:23:27,963
- Who's got the rope?
- It has to go over there.

317
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,733
- Right, then
- Ready?

318
00:23:30,521 --> 00:23:31,534
Heave!

319
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:43,423
Walt, are you hurt?

320
00:23:44,425 --> 00:23:45,960
You saved my life.

321
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:50,926
What? Oh.
I saved you from a sore head.

322
00:23:51,321 --> 00:23:53,600
No, I was nearly dead.

323
00:23:55,293 --> 00:23:56,293
Very well.

324
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,960
Children?

325
00:23:59,774 --> 00:24:02,682
Now I have to save your life,
in return.

326
00:24:03,216 --> 00:24:05,160
No, no, there's no need.

327
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:07,593
No! I have to!

328
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:12,357
All right.

329
00:24:14,844 --> 00:24:16,000
What did I miss?

330
00:24:17,972 --> 00:24:20,010
We are rigging tonight's fight.

331
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,222
So I want you

332
00:24:22,342 --> 00:24:25,104
to take as many bets as you can

333
00:24:25,224 --> 00:24:26,878
on our new gladiator.

334
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:29,282
Aw, does that mean
he's going to be the loser?

335
00:24:29,402 --> 00:24:31,069
Why don't you say that a bit louder?

336
00:24:31,189 --> 00:24:33,882
- Does he have to?
- For heaven's sake, Walt!

337
00:24:34,002 --> 00:24:35,440
He can win next time.

338
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,160
Right, off you go.
And make sure you give good odds.

339
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,580
- Go, go, go!
<i>- It has to go there!</i>

340
00:24:41,696 --> 00:24:44,440
<i>Place your bets here!
Place your bets!</i>

341
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,840
Be a winner!

342
00:24:49,412 --> 00:24:52,600
We've had a special request
for tonight's fight.

343
00:24:53,323 --> 00:24:57,232
Our new attraction
appears for one night only.

344
00:24:57,352 --> 00:24:59,708
At the end of the fight,
I want you to kill him.

345
00:24:59,828 --> 00:25:00,828
No!

346
00:25:01,056 --> 00:25:03,511
Do you know what they do
to little pigs with big ears?

347
00:25:03,631 --> 00:25:06,581
- You're hurting me!
- They take them to market!

348
00:25:12,753 --> 00:25:14,553
Why is Gisborne after you?

349
00:25:16,091 --> 00:25:18,491
Cos I'm an outlaw.
It's a long story.

350
00:25:23,248 --> 00:25:25,680
- Looks like he's been here a while.
- Yeah.

351
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,320
And he could be here a lot longer.
He's picked a good position.

352
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,761
Only one way out. Easy to defend.

353
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:36,753
There's no-one defending it now,
I mean... Where's Gisborne?

354
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,840
Where I've been all along.

355
00:25:39,525 --> 00:25:40,775
One step ahead.

356
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,634
Guy! Non!

357
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,538
Mon frère, doux!

358
00:26:07,168 --> 00:26:08,000
Isabella?

359
00:26:14,628 --> 00:26:15,928
He's my brother.

360
00:26:18,873 --> 00:26:20,755
- Get after them!
- No.

361
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,784
- I had him!
- Guy, tell me.

362
00:26:25,904 --> 00:26:28,254
At the point of my sword!
I had him!

363
00:26:30,133 --> 00:26:32,938
- Why are you here, Isabella?
- I could not endure another day.

364
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:34,720
So, what? You just walked away?

365
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,320
- You were joined in holy matrimony!
- I was only a 13-year-old girl!

366
00:26:38,676 --> 00:26:41,429
If you had any idea
of what he has done to me...

367
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:44,811
Guy, I'm your sister.
All I ask for is protection.

368
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:48,094
Well, it seems you've already
received that from Robin Hood.

369
00:26:48,214 --> 00:26:50,054
I knew nothing of his true nature.

370
00:26:50,174 --> 00:26:53,003
I was in need of help.
The help I'm asking from you now.

371
00:26:53,123 --> 00:26:56,180
Really? And what if I were
to send you back to your husband?

372
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,712
Then you'd be condemning me
to a life of misery for a second time.

373
00:26:59,832 --> 00:27:02,565
Only this time,
you'd be doing it knowingly.

374
00:27:02,685 --> 00:27:05,890
Guy, I don't believe
you knew the damage you were doing

375
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:08,444
when you sent me to Squire Thornton.
But now you do.

376
00:27:08,564 --> 00:27:11,981
Surely you must feel
some obligation towards me?

377
00:27:12,101 --> 00:27:14,551
- A sense of loyalty, duty?
- Loyalty?

378
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:18,760
How can you speak of loyalty, when you
have twice aided and abetted Robin Hood?

379
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,793
A mistake,
and one I will not make again.

380
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,080
Give me a chance, and I will earn back
your trust and your respect.

381
00:27:26,241 --> 00:27:27,546
But please...

382
00:27:28,156 --> 00:27:29,960
do not send me back to my husband.

383
00:27:36,386 --> 00:27:37,476
Very well.

384
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,287
You may stay.

385
00:27:41,336 --> 00:27:42,480
Thank you.

386
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:46,230
But if I find you
in Hood's company again,

387
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,480
I will drag you back
to Shrewsbury myself.

388
00:27:51,034 --> 00:27:52,384
You have my word.

389
00:27:58,556 --> 00:28:00,689
I knew! I knew there was
something off about her.

390
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:02,920
Just concentrate on the plan,
all right?

391
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,960
I mean, Gisborne's sister?

392
00:28:05,193 --> 00:28:08,343
- I can't believe you fell for it.
- Kate, the plan.

393
00:28:08,463 --> 00:28:11,385
- Well, I'm not happy about it.
- When are you ever?

394
00:28:11,505 --> 00:28:13,844
Robin cannot just walk
into Gisborne's camp,

395
00:28:13,964 --> 00:28:17,427
alone, with no means of defence,
against Black Elite, and a massive cat!

396
00:28:17,547 --> 00:28:19,640
If we storm in there, we'll be shot.

397
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,980
- Robin looks like he's surrendering.
- Not one of your better plans.

398
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,100
- If we waited...
- For what?

399
00:28:25,325 --> 00:28:27,491
Isabella to divulge
everything she knows about us?

400
00:28:27,611 --> 00:28:28,769
She wouldn't.

401
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,479
All right? I know she wouldn't.

402
00:28:34,036 --> 00:28:35,455
It's a good plan.

403
00:28:36,503 --> 00:28:38,753
Robin won't be undefended for long.

404
00:28:39,587 --> 00:28:40,920
Allan, let's go.

405
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:44,830
He may look small,
but he's strong, and he's very smart.

406
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,800
Sounds like trouble to me.

407
00:28:47,336 --> 00:28:49,944
Not too smart, no need to worry
about an impertinent tongue.

408
00:28:50,064 --> 00:28:51,960
Though you could always
have it cut out.

409
00:28:52,136 --> 00:28:53,727
I'll give you ten crowns.

410
00:28:53,847 --> 00:28:56,518
No, I'm thinking 20 crowns.

411
00:28:58,082 --> 00:28:59,560
- Not likely.
- 15.

412
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,003
13. Final offer.

413
00:29:04,157 --> 00:29:05,360
All right. Deal.

414
00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:09,640
Please don't sell me. I won't say
anything to him. I'll keep quiet.

415
00:29:09,924 --> 00:29:11,824
I wish I could believe that.

416
00:29:18,711 --> 00:29:20,211
Is that all you got?

417
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:24,040
Nearly show time, lads.

418
00:29:24,543 --> 00:29:25,620
And...

419
00:29:27,494 --> 00:29:29,393
we've got the Sheriff watching.

420
00:29:29,513 --> 00:29:32,874
So, let's make sure
we give him what he wants.

421
00:29:33,127 --> 00:29:34,354
What's that?

422
00:29:34,849 --> 00:29:37,043
A fight to the near death.

423
00:29:37,378 --> 00:29:40,128
- Blood, guts...
- I don't want to hurt him.

424
00:29:41,185 --> 00:29:43,960
Don't worry, you won't.
You'll be losing this bout.

425
00:29:44,486 --> 00:29:46,011
What? Why?

426
00:29:46,432 --> 00:29:48,004
Why do you think?

427
00:29:48,124 --> 00:29:49,233
The Sheriff.

428
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,323
He wants it rigged so he can clean up
on the bets we take.

429
00:29:52,443 --> 00:29:55,597
And if we don't make enough,
he will hang us all.

430
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:58,479
All you gotta do is watch out
for my signal.

431
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:01,120
When you see that,
you go down, and you stay down.

432
00:30:01,637 --> 00:30:03,520
- Stay down.
- You do that,

433
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,399
and the Sheriff gets what he wants.

434
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:08,891
If you don't,
we won't get out of here alive.

435
00:30:10,532 --> 00:30:13,482
Well, you're not giving me much choice,
are you?

436
00:30:21,894 --> 00:30:22,894
Robin?

437
00:30:30,865 --> 00:30:33,320
- Welcome.
- I like what you've done here.

438
00:30:33,639 --> 00:30:35,639
I wasn't expecting your visit.

439
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:38,939
Well,
I find that very hard to believe.

440
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:44,438
- Given him a full report, have you?
- No conversation with my sister.

441
00:30:44,647 --> 00:30:48,047
- She knows where her loyalties lie.
- I'm sure she does.

442
00:30:49,883 --> 00:30:53,319
So...
would you like to hear my demands?

443
00:30:54,098 --> 00:30:55,397
Demands?

444
00:30:56,149 --> 00:30:59,801
- Please, demand away.
- It's quite simple, really.

445
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:02,208
Get out of my forest.

446
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:06,440
Yeah, that's a reasonable request.

447
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,600
Let me think...

448
00:31:08,883 --> 00:31:11,198
- Kill him.
- Now!

449
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:20,390
Guards!

450
00:31:30,687 --> 00:31:31,919
Hood!

451
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,062
Let's see how many of your men
he can stomach!

452
00:31:35,182 --> 00:31:36,332
Eh, Gisborne?

453
00:31:38,495 --> 00:31:39,520
Come on,

454
00:31:40,235 --> 00:31:41,677
let's find John!

455
00:31:43,105 --> 00:31:46,579
<i>Gather round, it's almost show-time!</i>

456
00:31:46,818 --> 00:31:49,722
<i>Is that all you've got?
Come on, place your bets here.</i>

457
00:31:49,842 --> 00:31:53,842
<i>Put your hands together
for Bertha of Bath!</i>

458
00:32:09,614 --> 00:32:10,847
Ladies!

459
00:32:11,183 --> 00:32:12,422
Gentlemen!

460
00:32:13,537 --> 00:32:15,265
Honoured guests!

461
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:20,152
Tonight,
you are truly in for a treat.

462
00:32:20,382 --> 00:32:22,240
You may have thought

463
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,793
the ancient art
of the gladiator was gone,

464
00:32:25,913 --> 00:32:27,994
but no!
Tonight...

465
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:33,180
you are in for a dazzling display
of their swordplay.

466
00:32:34,146 --> 00:32:36,199
Welcome our gladiators warmly!

467
00:32:42,087 --> 00:32:45,304
Tonight, they fight
for nothing but pride,

468
00:32:45,424 --> 00:32:47,585
and your applause only.

469
00:32:53,718 --> 00:32:54,759
So...

470
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,639
without further ado...

471
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:01,679
Gladiators ready?

472
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,100
Fight!

473
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,508
- Let me go!
- Behave yourself!

474
00:33:27,628 --> 00:33:29,578
I don't want to come, please!

475
00:33:32,066 --> 00:33:34,592
You belong to me now, so shut up!

476
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,437
That's it. Don't go down just yet.

477
00:33:45,404 --> 00:33:47,839
Guy, what about your men?
You can't just leave them.

478
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,042
They've failed me.

479
00:33:49,162 --> 00:33:52,840
Is that why you gave me
to Squire Thornton? Did I fail you too?

480
00:33:54,203 --> 00:33:56,120
{\Why won't you }Answer me!
Don't you owe me that at least?

481
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,562
- I owe you nothing. I did for the best.
- For who? You?

482
00:33:59,682 --> 00:34:02,207
You did nothing but condemn me to hell,
I demand to know why.

483
00:34:02,327 --> 00:34:04,320
Foolish girl,
you don't understand the world.

484
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,179
No, I understand perfectly.

485
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:08,479
I just want to hear it from you.

486
00:34:08,967 --> 00:34:10,559
Why did you give me away?

487
00:34:12,164 --> 00:34:15,559
- I said, why did you give me...?
- He offered a fair price for you!

488
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:22,880
So...
do you still require my protection?

489
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:26,759
You know I do.

490
00:34:51,327 --> 00:34:55,131
No, you fool,
you're supposed to be the loser!

491
00:34:58,604 --> 00:34:59,878
Let me through!

492
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,340
Let me past!

493
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,880
Let me through! Out of the way!

494
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,570
No! He's going to kill you! No!

495
00:35:31,591 --> 00:35:34,891
She told him to do it. I heard.
That's why she sold me!

496
00:35:35,746 --> 00:35:37,571
- What?
- He's exaggerating.

497
00:35:37,691 --> 00:35:39,638
It's what he does.
You know how he goes on.

498
00:35:39,758 --> 00:35:43,241
I'm telling the truth to save your life,
just like I said I would.

499
00:35:43,361 --> 00:35:46,670
I warned you what would happen
the next time you crossed me! Kill him!

500
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:48,595
Arrest the others!

501
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,839
- Follow me, boys!
- Stop them! Stop!

502
00:35:55,834 --> 00:35:57,183
Kill them!

503
00:35:57,681 --> 00:36:00,839
- You sold him!
- I had no choice. The Sheriff...

504
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:04,595
No! She sold me because
I heard her talking about killing you!

505
00:36:04,715 --> 00:36:06,959
- What?
- She was going to get Titus to do it.

506
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:08,723
No, you don't understand!

507
00:36:08,843 --> 00:36:11,995
If I didn't do what the Sheriff told me,
he was going to kill us all.

508
00:36:12,115 --> 00:36:14,357
What an excellent idea!

509
00:36:18,711 --> 00:36:22,711
So, exactly how far
did you think you'd get, Bertha?

510
00:36:22,831 --> 00:36:24,680
- We had a deal
- The deal is off.

511
00:36:25,155 --> 00:36:26,720
You do not touch those children.

512
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:29,399
No, no, I just want
the money from the wagers.

513
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:31,769
She's welcome to the slaving money.

514
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,040
What?

515
00:36:36,376 --> 00:36:40,190
I suppose she told you that she took
the children off the street

516
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:42,460
out of the goodness of her heart?

517
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:46,959
Look at them.
They're healthy and well-fed...

518
00:36:47,198 --> 00:36:50,272
Healthier children
fetch a bigger price!

519
00:36:51,314 --> 00:36:52,999
She's being doing it for years.

520
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,727
Taking waifs and strays
off the streets,

521
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:59,203
fattening them up, and then selling them
on at the end of the season.

522
00:36:59,323 --> 00:37:02,485
- Have you?
- Yes, not this year though.

523
00:37:02,843 --> 00:37:04,962
- Take her to the dungeons.
- No!

524
00:37:05,082 --> 00:37:06,680
Oh, and... arrest those.

525
00:37:07,405 --> 00:37:11,279
- Leave them be!
- Somebody kill that man.

526
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,919
- Run!
- Come on, boys! Run!

527
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:28,728
I leave you alone
for one minute, John...

528
00:37:28,848 --> 00:37:30,939
Get back, get back!

529
00:37:31,912 --> 00:37:33,973
It used to be safe
for children in Nottingham.

530
00:37:34,093 --> 00:37:35,718
So says the outlaw.

531
00:37:36,304 --> 00:37:39,840
But, for once, I am pleased to see you,
Hood. It means that Gisborne

532
00:37:40,001 --> 00:37:43,120
has snatched defeat
from the jaws of victory once again!

533
00:37:43,584 --> 00:37:44,728
After them!

534
00:37:52,761 --> 00:37:53,818
Open it!

535
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,801
Idiots! Open it!

536
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,140
{\pos(192,230)}- Who will watch out for me now?
- You're safe now.

537
00:38:03,774 --> 00:38:07,159
<i>No-one's gonna hurt you.
Everything's gonna be fine.</i>

538
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,199
Thank you.

539
00:38:13,585 --> 00:38:14,585
John!

540
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,620
I want to stay with you.

541
00:38:22,497 --> 00:38:23,497
I know.

542
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:26,590
But it wouldn't be safe.

543
00:38:28,585 --> 00:38:30,396
I have a job to do, Walt.

544
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:33,066
Helping other people
who are in trouble.

545
00:38:33,801 --> 00:38:36,401
I can't do that
if I'm looking after you.

546
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:38,627
But I could look after you.

547
00:38:39,143 --> 00:38:41,298
- I saved his life.
- Walt...

548
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:44,894
Will I ever see you again?

549
00:38:47,957 --> 00:38:49,408
I hope so.

550
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,678
Good luck.

551
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:56,664
- Take care of your brother.
- Take care of each other.

552
00:39:00,656 --> 00:39:01,880
Can I help you?

553
00:39:03,824 --> 00:39:06,476
Well might you hang your head
in shame, Gisborne.

554
00:39:06,596 --> 00:39:08,842
You've let him escape, again,
and this... this!

555
00:39:08,962 --> 00:39:11,028
Is this what distracted you?

556
00:39:11,384 --> 00:39:12,987
This is my sister.

557
00:39:15,065 --> 00:39:18,461
Oh, I'm so sorry.
You were busy playing happy families?

558
00:39:21,235 --> 00:39:23,827
Well, your level
of incompetence never, ever

559
00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:25,897
ceases to amaze me, Gisborne.

560
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,960
Every time I think
you've plumbed a new depth,

561
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,100
along you come,
and surprise me all over again.

562
00:39:32,493 --> 00:39:35,818
Well, maybe now
Prince John will remember

563
00:39:36,188 --> 00:39:38,214
why he put me in command!

564
00:40:00,362 --> 00:40:03,427
- Is this what you're looking for?
- That's mine!

565
00:40:06,351 --> 00:40:09,871
Not your mistress'? If I'd have known
you were Gisborne's sister...

566
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:13,280
You'd have killed me?
And after I had already saved you.

567
00:40:13,441 --> 00:40:16,763
- You made your choice when you lied!
- You think I have a choice?

568
00:40:16,883 --> 00:40:20,013
My fate has been decided for me
since I was a child.

569
00:40:20,133 --> 00:40:22,385
You knew it was him chasing us,
and you said nothing.

570
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:25,455
- I didn't know it was him!
- He's your brother!

571
00:40:25,595 --> 00:40:28,308
I hadn't seen him
since I was thirteen.

572
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:29,640
When I realised...

573
00:40:30,249 --> 00:40:31,360
I was shocked.

574
00:40:32,158 --> 00:40:34,634
- You have to believe me.
- No.

575
00:40:36,273 --> 00:40:38,240
That's the last thing I have to do.

576
00:40:38,962 --> 00:40:41,480
Because you've been lying to me
ever since we met.

577
00:40:42,131 --> 00:40:44,760
You know,
I preferred you as a wronged servant.

578
00:40:45,085 --> 00:40:46,113
So do I.

579
00:40:46,442 --> 00:40:48,349
Better that, than a wronged sister,

580
00:40:48,469 --> 00:40:51,120
who was sold to her husband
like a piece of meat.

581
00:40:51,508 --> 00:40:54,058
I couldn't tell you
I was Lady Thornton.

582
00:40:55,642 --> 00:40:57,060
You're Robin Hood.

583
00:40:58,136 --> 00:41:00,338
I know what you do to nobles.

584
00:41:01,203 --> 00:41:03,586
I never turn my back
on someone in true need.

585
00:41:03,706 --> 00:41:06,449
Good.
Because that's exactly what I am.

586
00:41:14,158 --> 00:41:16,350
Goodbye, Isabella.

587
00:41:20,401 --> 00:41:22,320
And thank you for the donation.

588
00:41:36,321 --> 00:41:38,153
Welcome to Nottingham,
Your Highness.

589
00:41:38,273 --> 00:41:40,467
Long live King John!

590
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,947
Long live me.

591
00:41:42,668 --> 00:41:44,040
Robin Hood isn't dead.

592
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,680
His blood is a gift I covet,
and yet no-one gives it me.

593
00:41:48,401 --> 00:41:50,680
- Italian or Spanish?
- Which do you prefer?

594
00:41:52,189 --> 00:41:53,388
Kate?

595
00:41:53,561 --> 00:41:57,561
You will kill the Sheriff for me,
Gisborne. Only the two of us will know.

596
00:41:58,161 --> 00:42:00,920
Wait until they're all inside,
then burn it to the ground.
