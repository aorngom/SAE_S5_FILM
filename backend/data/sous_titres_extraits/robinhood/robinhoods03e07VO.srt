1
00:00:24,472 --> 00:00:26,040
That's the last drop.

2
00:00:27,424 --> 00:00:28,576
God help us.

3
00:00:33,118 --> 00:00:36,318
Do you know, I don't know
who's hotter, you or me.

4
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,828
It's you, Sire.

5
00:00:40,547 --> 00:00:41,547
You...

6
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,787
are hot...

7
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:45,592
hot...

8
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,080
... hot.

9
00:00:49,568 --> 00:00:51,694
If we could get back
to the business in hand, Sire.

10
00:00:51,814 --> 00:00:53,231
Do we have to?

11
00:00:55,454 --> 00:00:57,404
I think I'll leave you to it.

12
00:01:07,393 --> 00:01:10,200
- Good evening.
- Oh, God! Don't do that!

13
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:14,864
Sorry. Just thought
I'd pop in on you.

14
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:17,559
I...

15
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,040
thought you might like
some of these.

16
00:01:22,413 --> 00:01:26,196
- I need to make arrangements.
- Do stop whinging, Gisborne.

17
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:29,545
I've told you, you're as good
as sheriff already.

18
00:01:29,935 --> 00:01:33,385
The only thing you don't have
is the title or the power...

19
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,040
or the castle.

20
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,280
But the truth is, right now,
there're more pressing matters.

21
00:01:38,662 --> 00:01:41,740
- Robin Hood.
- Now, obviously, he has to hang.

22
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:45,880
The only problem is, the people
do rather insist on adoring him still.

23
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:48,600
- The people are fools, Sire.
- Of course they are.

24
00:01:48,944 --> 00:01:50,480
But we need their co-operation

25
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,590
if my plans for England
are to come to fruition.

26
00:01:54,594 --> 00:01:57,076
So... I need to woo them,

27
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,836
make them love me.

28
00:02:00,756 --> 00:02:02,480
Yes, Sire. But how?

29
00:02:03,141 --> 00:02:05,360
By giving them
what they want, of course.

30
00:02:06,235 --> 00:02:09,385
What they want more than anything
with this drought.

31
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,760
Water.

32
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,700
Juicy.

33
00:02:25,476 --> 00:02:28,049
<i>Prepare the horses! I wish to leave!</i>

34
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,399
Good night, Isabella.

35
00:02:34,805 --> 00:02:36,455
Good night, Robin Hood.

36
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:44,720
You'll accompany me
on my trip back to the castle.

37
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:46,631
We'll visit the dungeons.

Episode seven
TOO HOT TO HANDLE

41
00:03:39,396 --> 00:03:43,057
Don't be scared, my dear.
I just want to show you something.

42
00:03:43,517 --> 00:03:45,640
Kindred spirits, you and I.

43
00:03:48,755 --> 00:03:51,417
Now, usually the water in here
comes halfway to the top,

44
00:03:51,537 --> 00:03:54,641
but my men are blocking
the spring that feeds it.

45
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,338
The same spring supplies the underground
water sources in Nottingham.

46
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:03,120
Within the hour, every well
within a ten-mile radius

47
00:04:03,287 --> 00:04:05,504
will be without water
in this drought.

48
00:04:05,624 --> 00:04:07,866
Which is when I shall start
giving them water

49
00:04:07,986 --> 00:04:10,128
from my own personal supplies.

50
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:11,966
And then, Isabella,

51
00:04:13,148 --> 00:04:16,400
then they shall realise
it is ME they should adore,

52
00:04:16,795 --> 00:04:19,398
ME they should worship and obey,
ME...

53
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,391
who is their kind
and merciful father.

54
00:04:23,374 --> 00:04:24,920
What if they don't?

55
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:28,280
Well,{\ then} the filthy little wretches
can die of thirst.

56
00:04:37,113 --> 00:04:38,120
Nothing.

57
00:04:39,501 --> 00:04:42,118
- I'm sorry.
- Have some of mine.

58
00:04:42,496 --> 00:04:44,919
- But you need it, too.
- Come on.

59
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:46,400
Take it, Ellie...

60
00:04:46,845 --> 00:04:48,282
for my godson.

61
00:04:50,342 --> 00:04:52,042
I've missed you so much!

62
00:04:53,161 --> 00:04:55,568
- How's the little tyke doing?
- You know,

63
00:04:55,688 --> 00:04:58,684
tears, tantrums,
fouling his pants...

64
00:04:58,804 --> 00:05:00,360
but enough about my husband.

65
00:05:01,798 --> 00:05:05,120
We'll get through this drought,
Kate. I know we will.

66
00:05:05,988 --> 00:05:08,592
- Change is coming, Robin.
- Is it, now?

67
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,323
I'm beginning to wonder
if we can really change anything.

68
00:05:12,443 --> 00:05:14,511
The Sheriff is dead.
Is that not change enough?

69
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:18,496
In his place is the Prince who does
nothing while his people die of thirst.

70
00:05:18,616 --> 00:05:21,160
- Thank goodness for me, then.
- Your recce went well?

71
00:05:22,162 --> 00:05:24,676
Two guards, one door
and twenty barrels

72
00:05:24,796 --> 00:05:28,076
of Prince John's cool, fresh water
hidden in a barn,

73
00:05:28,196 --> 00:05:29,960
just begging to be sampled.

74
00:05:30,785 --> 00:05:33,520
- I don't believe it.
- There's no point resisting it!

75
00:05:33,815 --> 00:05:36,608
I saw them.
They were all over each other.

76
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,316
Sire, is it possible that you could
have misread the situation?

77
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:44,872
Well, we'll see, won't we?

78
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:48,112
Because I've set her a little trap.

79
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,440
A trap?

80
00:05:49,876 --> 00:05:53,429
I told her about my plan with the water.
If she is in league with Hood,

81
00:05:53,549 --> 00:05:56,076
I suspect she'll want to find him
and tell him all about it,

82
00:05:56,196 --> 00:05:59,785
and when she does, you'll be there,
because you'll be following.

83
00:05:59,905 --> 00:06:00,905
And then?

84
00:06:02,093 --> 00:06:03,543
What do you expect?

85
00:06:03,978 --> 00:06:06,079
They're traitors. Execute them.

86
00:06:08,065 --> 00:06:09,408
Both of them?

87
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:12,921
Gisborne,

88
00:06:14,321 --> 00:06:16,171
I have great plans for you.

89
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,973
I do hope you're not suffering
from any pathetic pangs

90
00:06:20,093 --> 00:06:21,693
of familial loyalty.

91
00:06:22,753 --> 00:06:24,014
None at all.

92
00:06:24,936 --> 00:06:27,196
My loyalty to you is absolute.

93
00:06:27,992 --> 00:06:30,716
Whatever the outcome, it shall be
my hand that resolves it for you,

94
00:06:30,836 --> 00:06:34,136
- and I promise you...
- Yes, bored now. Leave, please.

95
00:06:54,401 --> 00:06:55,701
Help me, please.

96
00:06:56,987 --> 00:06:58,925
- Help me.
- Naff off!

97
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:03,760
This drought's made me so thirsty
that... I need water, please.

98
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:06,111
There's no water here for you.

99
00:07:06,231 --> 00:07:07,581
I'm parched, sir.

100
00:07:09,271 --> 00:07:11,120
- Please.
- Get lost!

101
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:14,076
Just a little to wet
my mouth, then, eh?

102
00:07:14,196 --> 00:07:16,533
It's as dry as a camel's bum
in a sandstorm.

103
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:19,240
You're giving me the hump!
Now push off.

104
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:21,000
There's no water here for you.

105
00:07:21,161 --> 00:07:22,161
Really?

106
00:07:23,467 --> 00:07:25,367
Well, what's all this, then?

107
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:29,800
And again!

108
00:07:35,018 --> 00:07:38,116
I mean, really, it's not like I asked
for ice and a slice, was it?

109
00:07:38,236 --> 00:07:41,080
Come on, let's get
this water to the villages.

110
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,280
Thank you.

111
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:46,209
Thank you.

112
00:07:46,976 --> 00:07:50,000
- It'll be fine. It'll be fine.
- Thank you.

113
00:07:50,161 --> 00:07:53,120
- So what's his name, then?
- Actually, his name's Robin.

114
00:07:53,691 --> 00:07:57,040
Is it? Thank you very much,
that's very flattering.

115
00:07:57,201 --> 00:07:58,779
No, after the bird.

116
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:03,661
One landed on his crib
the day he was born.

117
00:08:04,196 --> 00:08:07,320
Course it did. Right, good, good.

118
00:08:09,633 --> 00:08:11,440
Joke. It was after you.

119
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:15,635
He's always been a poorly lad, so...

120
00:08:15,755 --> 00:08:17,440
{\we thought }we{\'d} gave him a name of strength.

121
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:19,200
Hello.

122
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:27,062
Let's have some water.

123
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,590
What's wrong?

124
00:08:37,135 --> 00:08:38,680
I envy them, Much.

125
00:08:39,237 --> 00:08:41,396
You know, they have nothing,

126
00:08:41,777 --> 00:08:44,320
and yet I envy them,
their lives, because...

127
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:46,147
That's better!

128
00:08:46,267 --> 00:08:49,035
... they have each other, you know?

129
00:08:50,231 --> 00:08:52,920
Well, we've got each other.

130
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,040
It's not the same, though, is it?

131
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,176
No. It's not.

132
00:09:00,147 --> 00:09:01,147
<i>Robin?</i>

133
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:05,640
What is it?

134
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:10,680
Isabella just spoke to me
as I was passing the manor.

135
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,760
She said she had important
information for you.

136
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:15,834
She wants to meet you in the meadow.

137
00:09:15,954 --> 00:09:16,954
Right, OK.

138
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,640
I'm going to have
to leave you awhile.

139
00:09:21,355 --> 00:09:22,880
Just had a message from Isabella.

140
00:09:24,113 --> 00:09:26,076
I think she may have information
about the well.

141
00:09:26,196 --> 00:09:27,440
You think that's wise?

142
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:29,200
Come on, {\Tuck}we've been through this.

143
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,478
{\My gut still tells me }I think there's something
not right about her.

144
00:09:31,598 --> 00:09:33,600
- She helped us before.
- She defied Prince John.

145
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,601
- She helped us put out the fire.
- She's Gisborne's sister!

146
00:09:36,721 --> 00:09:38,719
You think she doesn't have
ulterior motives?

147
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:41,262
Or maybe you think
she just likes you for being you.

148
00:09:41,382 --> 00:09:43,520
The truth is,
Robin Hood is needed here.

149
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,458
The water in these barrels will last
each village a day{\ or so} at most.

150
00:09:46,578 --> 00:09:48,400
Soon the very old and{\ the very} young
will start dying.

151
00:09:48,561 --> 00:09:50,779
That's exactly why I should
go and meet her.

152
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:52,618
If she has information
about the wells...

153
00:09:52,738 --> 00:09:55,520
- I hear there's water in the Trent.
- And I hear that there isn't.

154
00:09:56,106 --> 00:09:58,705
And even if I'm wrong,
it's still only a temporary solution.

155
00:09:58,825 --> 00:10:01,520
We need something permanent,
and Isabella may offer us that.

156
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,920
- I'll be back. Wait for me here.
- Robin!

157
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:06,916
Wait here.

158
00:10:25,996 --> 00:10:29,080
Well, I am punctual...
if nothing else.

159
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:30,920
You have to stop doing that.

160
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,650
So...

161
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:38,440
what's so important that you'd risk
being seen with me in public?

162
00:10:39,095 --> 00:10:41,040
Prince John's blocked the spring

163
00:10:41,201 --> 00:10:43,480
<i>that provides the water supply
to the villages.</i>

164
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:46,156
We have to find a way
of unblocking the spring.{\ then, don't we?}

165
00:10:46,276 --> 00:10:50,276
There's another entrance to the chamber
via an overflow outside the town.

166
00:10:50,445 --> 00:10:52,502
One of the guardstold me about it.

167
00:10:52,622 --> 00:10:55,480
It eventually leads to the chamber
underneath the castle dungeons.

168
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,040
If we go in that way,
we can bypass the castle completely.

169
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,211
What do you mean... "we"?

170
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,415
I mean I can take you there myself.

171
00:11:05,535 --> 00:11:06,535
Would you?

172
00:11:07,415 --> 00:11:09,440
And lead me straight
into the dragon's lair.

173
00:11:10,276 --> 00:11:12,996
What do I have to do
to make you trust me?

174
00:11:13,116 --> 00:11:17,116
I'm not my brother, Robin. {\Look, }I have
no interest in being on the losing side.

175
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,040
So this is a politically
motivated act.

176
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:25,198
Call it what you want.
Political manoeuvring...

177
00:11:26,336 --> 00:11:28,720
undermining my louse of a brother...

178
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:32,256
<i>... a naked attempt...</i>

179
00:11:32,761 --> 00:11:34,676
to get you to like me more.

180
00:11:44,974 --> 00:11:46,960
You can trust me, I swear.

181
00:11:47,312 --> 00:11:48,412
Right. Well,

182
00:11:51,393 --> 00:11:53,680
we have to go back
and get the others,

183
00:11:53,841 --> 00:11:56,556
because we're gonna need
all the help we can get.

184
00:11:56,676 --> 00:11:59,976
All right? And then we'll go,
straight to the entrance.

185
00:12:02,497 --> 00:12:03,647
Now, come on.

186
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:05,680
Come on!

187
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,000
Horses! Run! Go!

188
00:12:15,614 --> 00:12:16,680
Good morning!

189
00:12:24,196 --> 00:12:26,506
Good morning to you all, my...

190
00:12:27,577 --> 00:12:28,677
my children.

191
00:12:29,109 --> 00:12:31,640
I know you've been suffering,
and when you hurt,

192
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:33,696
I hurt.

193
00:12:33,816 --> 00:12:36,807
Which is why I am here now,
to dispense succour,

194
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:41,625
quench your thirst
and to give you the gift of life itself,

195
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,160
through water.

196
00:12:43,771 --> 00:12:45,160
Water for every...

197
00:12:50,756 --> 00:12:52,777
Where did you get that?

198
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,954
There's no need to be scared,
as long as you tell the truth.

199
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,167
You see...

200
00:13:06,156 --> 00:13:07,306
this water...

201
00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:09,568
is mine.

202
00:13:11,714 --> 00:13:12,714
So...

203
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,135
where did you get it?

204
00:13:15,915 --> 00:13:16,960
Hood, Sire.

205
00:13:18,796 --> 00:13:19,796
Of course.

206
00:13:21,556 --> 00:13:22,556
Hood.

207
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,360
Men, give this man a drink.

208
00:13:26,521 --> 00:13:27,521
Come here!

209
00:13:33,194 --> 00:13:34,594
I really wouldn't.

210
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,831
You've seen already
how your treachery pays.

211
00:13:39,155 --> 00:13:42,355
You like my water so much,
from now on you pay for it

212
00:13:43,006 --> 00:13:44,400
A penny a gallon.

213
00:13:44,561 --> 00:13:46,840
But Sire, we don't have
that sort of money.

214
00:13:47,001 --> 00:13:48,456
Well, sell something -

215
00:13:48,576 --> 00:13:52,117
some grain, a cow, a grandparent.
I don't care.

216
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:55,467
- My baby needs water to live, Sire.
- Yes,

217
00:13:56,132 --> 00:13:57,732
on that we both agree.

218
00:14:04,556 --> 00:14:08,316
If you won't love me,
then by God you'll fear me!

219
00:14:24,054 --> 00:14:25,454
What have we done?

220
00:14:28,845 --> 00:14:32,361
What do you think your brother would say
if he knew we were together?

221
00:14:32,481 --> 00:14:34,881
Guy still wet the bed
when he was 12.

222
00:14:35,087 --> 00:14:37,137
- He doesn't scare me.
- Yeah?

223
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,843
I'll be sure to mention that to him
the next time I see him.

224
00:14:42,521 --> 00:14:44,235
- What the...
- Gisborne!

225
00:14:44,355 --> 00:14:46,720
- How could you do this to me, Isabella?
- What is this?

226
00:14:47,494 --> 00:14:49,120
- You tricked me!
- I didn't{\ trick you}...

227
00:14:49,281 --> 00:14:50,200
With him!

228
00:14:50,361 --> 00:14:51,960
- How could he know{\ where we were}?
- {\You're }My sister!

229
00:14:52,121 --> 00:14:53,080
He{\must have} followed me.

230
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,006
- Liar!
- He's an outlaw, a murderer.

231
00:14:55,126 --> 00:14:56,637
Would he shackle me if I'd known?{\ - ... a traitor!}

232
00:14:56,757 --> 00:14:59,483
You kissed me. You made me believe
{\that }we may have a future together.

233
00:14:59,603 --> 00:15:02,953
- You swore you'd never see him again!
- Guy, let me go!

234
00:15:03,073 --> 00:15:05,573
You are my brother.
You will let me go.

235
00:15:07,124 --> 00:15:08,360
Please, Guy.

236
00:15:12,756 --> 00:15:15,269
All right, I will.

237
00:15:16,736 --> 00:15:19,094
I'll give you another chance,
Isabella.

238
00:15:19,214 --> 00:15:21,200
I mean, we all make mistakes,
don't we?

239
00:15:22,077 --> 00:15:24,252
What a shame you didn't show
that{\same} compassion to Marian

240
00:15:24,372 --> 00:15:26,560
- before you ran her through.
- Shut it!

241
00:15:29,522 --> 00:15:32,573
So... I will unshackle you...

242
00:15:32,693 --> 00:15:34,196
- Thank you.
- On one condition.

243
00:15:34,316 --> 00:15:37,016
Why is there always
one condition with you?

244
00:15:37,344 --> 00:15:40,960
Prove to me that you understand
the terrible error you have made.

245
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,880
Kill him...

246
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,040
in front of me...

247
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:50,566
... with this.

248
00:15:52,105 --> 00:15:55,400
If you do that,
I will lie to Prince John.

249
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,280
What does he know?

250
00:15:57,741 --> 00:16:00,860
I will tell him that he misread
what he saw last night,

251
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,400
and your life will be spared.

252
00:16:11,891 --> 00:16:12,941
Just do it.

253
00:16:16,421 --> 00:16:19,880
You're a rubbish kisser anyway. {\Just }Save us
all the pretence and do it quickly.

254
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:22,320
It'll make his day.

255
00:16:22,575 --> 00:16:25,440
Fine! I will, then. You were right.

256
00:16:27,413 --> 00:16:31,000
It was obviously a mistake
having anything to do with this weasel.

257
00:16:36,227 --> 00:16:37,320
Unshackle me

258
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,480
and I'll put things right.

259
00:17:23,124 --> 00:17:25,985
- You were going to do it!
- What are you talking about?

260
00:17:26,105 --> 00:17:28,270
I was tricking him.
I helped you fight him!

261
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,680
That was helping me?!

262
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,031
- I gave you the stick, you fool!
- Gave it to me? I took it from you!

263
00:17:33,151 --> 00:17:35,715
Yeah, course you did,
because you are so perfect!

264
00:17:35,835 --> 00:17:36,840
Oh, shut up!

265
00:17:45,424 --> 00:17:48,974
- What are you doing?
- What I've wanted to do for 17 years.

266
00:17:49,716 --> 00:17:52,915
- Consigning him to hell.
- Isabella, once you do it,

267
00:17:53,035 --> 00:17:56,280
there's no going back.
There's nothing more to be said or done.

268
00:17:56,441 --> 00:17:58,320
This will do all the talking I need.

269
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,408
What about what he may have to say?

270
00:18:01,528 --> 00:18:04,328
The only thing I ever wanted
to hear from him

271
00:18:05,243 --> 00:18:07,236
was a plea for forgiveness,

272
00:18:07,925 --> 00:18:11,520
some admission of guilt that it was
his fault that I was so unhappy.

273
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,279
He sold his own sister to a man
who made my life a misery.

274
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:26,200
That's why you shouldn't
let him off so easily.

275
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,396
Come on,

276
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,320
give it to me.

277
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,190
You will pay.

278
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:40,934
Some day, you will pay.

279
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:49,401
Get the key.

280
00:18:55,629 --> 00:18:56,636
Great.

281
00:18:57,184 --> 00:18:58,196
Oh, no!

282
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,440
Look, it's all right, we're fine.

283
00:19:01,601 --> 00:19:04,360
We'll go to Clun. It's nearer than the
camp. There'll be a blacksmith{\ there}.

284
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,240
Take it back.

285
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,436
Take what back?

286
00:19:08,556 --> 00:19:11,120
The bit about being a rubbish kisser.
Take it back.

287
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,520
- Fine, you're not a rubbish kisser.
- {\So }Why did you say it?

288
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,040
To make you angry.

289
00:19:16,135 --> 00:19:17,400
We need to tie him up.

290
00:19:21,488 --> 00:19:24,556
It's a fine line, isn't it,
between love and hate?

291
00:19:26,655 --> 00:19:28,680
Two sides of the same coin, really.

292
00:19:29,982 --> 00:19:32,082
Maybe they need to truly hate me

293
00:19:32,882 --> 00:19:35,832
before they can understand
how to truly love me.

294
00:19:40,672 --> 00:19:42,022
A penny a gallon.

295
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:45,316
{\And }Put guards on all the roads
to the River Trent.

296
00:19:45,436 --> 00:19:48,386
Any water in there is now
requisitioned by me...

297
00:19:49,187 --> 00:19:51,037
for the good of the nation.

298
00:19:59,196 --> 00:20:00,496
Clun's this way.

299
00:20:01,153 --> 00:20:02,476
It's this way.

300
00:20:02,893 --> 00:20:04,522
I know which way it is.

301
00:20:04,642 --> 00:20:08,116
Isabella, I live in the forest.
I know Clun is this way.

302
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,811
Right. You think I'm going to lead you
into another trap, right?

303
00:20:11,931 --> 00:20:14,276
Fine, we'll go your way.

304
00:20:15,524 --> 00:20:18,320
- {\Well, }If you think... We can go...
- No, no, no. No, really.

305
00:20:18,481 --> 00:20:21,636
Isabella, I am letting you
have your own way.

306
00:20:21,942 --> 00:20:25,480
Surely you can't get angry with me
for letting you have your own way{\, can you}?

307
00:20:26,422 --> 00:20:28,160
You've not been out with many women{\, have you}?

308
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,648
There are people who need our help
and they need it fast.

309
00:20:30,768 --> 00:20:34,557
We can go whichever way you want,
all right? But just decide.

310
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:37,560
Fine.

311
00:20:46,457 --> 00:20:48,000
<i>How long has he been this ill?</i>

312
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,160
Since the water ran out.

313
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,977
It's just a fever.
He's going to be fine.

314
00:20:57,266 --> 00:20:58,440
Absolutely.

315
00:21:07,222 --> 00:21:10,083
- We need to do something.
- Robin told us to wait here.

316
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:13,480
That baby has a few hours at the most.
His temperature is raging.

317
00:21:13,824 --> 00:21:17,200
All the wells and springs
around Nottingham have dried up.

318
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,079
- We need to go to the river.
- And take the weaker ones with us.

319
00:21:20,199 --> 00:21:22,970
- Yes.
- But what if there is no water there?

320
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,720
What if Robin is solving
the problem{\ with the wells}?

321
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,520
If we stay here and the water returns,
then everything's sorted.

322
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,770
That's three ifs. We need to make
a decision based on what we know,

323
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:34,160
and we know that people will die,
unless we take action now.

324
00:21:41,621 --> 00:21:43,812
Isabella, tell me
where the entrance is.

325
00:21:43,932 --> 00:21:46,120
I'll {\try to }get to the spring source
and clear it on my own.

326
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,200
- You can still try and escape.
- Escape? To where?

327
00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:51,679
My brother was my protector.

328
00:21:52,716 --> 00:21:55,216
Without him, I have nothing.

329
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:57,160
You have me.

330
00:22:33,374 --> 00:22:35,002
What was she like?

331
00:22:36,246 --> 00:22:37,649
What was who like?

332
00:22:37,769 --> 00:22:40,220
The woman that my brother killed.

333
00:22:45,812 --> 00:22:47,265
She was Marian.

334
00:22:48,151 --> 00:22:51,220
Well, she must have been
a pretty special woman,

335
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,840
to have such a hold
over you and my brother.

336
00:22:58,445 --> 00:23:02,080
She never gave your brother
a reason to feel anything for her.

337
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:03,648
And you?

338
00:23:05,871 --> 00:23:07,625
I just want to forget.

339
00:23:16,148 --> 00:23:18,829
Hey, come on, we're nearly there.

340
00:23:40,901 --> 00:23:42,551
When I was in Anatolia,

341
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:45,036
when we were really desperate,

342
00:23:45,156 --> 00:23:47,476
we'd find a lizard and squeeze it

343
00:23:47,685 --> 00:23:51,040
until the contents of its bladder
emptied into our mouths.

344
00:23:51,392 --> 00:23:53,942
What did you squeeze
if you were hungry?

345
00:23:54,146 --> 00:23:56,346
Perhaps we should turn back, Tuck.

346
00:23:56,892 --> 00:23:58,760
There is no way we are turning back.

347
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:02,099
Keep your heads down
and your weapons hidden.

348
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:04,051
John.

349
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,520
- Good day to you, my son.
- No way through today.

350
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,720
Trent's water
is requisitioned by the Crown.

351
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,436
We need water now.

352
00:24:15,556 --> 00:24:18,360
Plenty available at the castle,
penny a gallon,

353
00:24:19,465 --> 00:24:21,836
unless you're not welcome there.

354
00:24:23,134 --> 00:24:24,412
Hello, Tuck!

355
00:24:39,241 --> 00:24:41,996
Run! Get in the trees!

356
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,440
Move!

357
00:25:03,184 --> 00:25:04,537
That was close.

358
00:25:06,335 --> 00:25:07,516
Where's Kate?

359
00:25:29,497 --> 00:25:31,520
That's the trap door
to the dungeons.

360
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,120
And that's where
the water flows to the wells.

361
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,480
- The spring is somewhere under there.
- Right.

362
00:25:40,191 --> 00:25:42,476
Best get started, then, eh?

363
00:25:48,337 --> 00:25:51,720
I need four men to go to the overflow
entrance and block the chamber.

364
00:25:51,881 --> 00:25:54,603
- Now!
<i>- You heard him! Move! Move!</i>

365
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:02,541
Come on!

366
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,605
Nearly there!

367
00:26:15,397 --> 00:26:16,397
Wait!

368
00:26:24,365 --> 00:26:27,605
- Your brother must have escaped.
- You guess right.

369
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,360
Guy, what are you doing?

370
00:26:32,521 --> 00:26:34,905
My duty to Prince John.

371
00:26:36,122 --> 00:26:37,756
Executing a traitor...

372
00:26:38,595 --> 00:26:40,000
and his accomplice.

373
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,240
Executing us?

374
00:26:44,802 --> 00:26:48,502
Now that all the exits are blocked,
you're both going to drown.

375
00:26:51,537 --> 00:26:53,881
The chamber will fill pretty quickly

376
00:26:54,001 --> 00:26:56,001
and you'll try to tread water.

377
00:26:56,854 --> 00:26:59,840
You might manage a few hours
- maybe even a day - who knows?

378
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:03,040
But in the end,
you'll just run out of energy.

379
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,895
I swear, if I get out of here alive,
I will kill you!

380
00:27:07,015 --> 00:27:10,315
Swear all you like, Hood,
it won't make any difference.

381
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,250
The legend dies here,

382
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,196
slowly and painfully,
I would imagine.

383
00:27:17,608 --> 00:27:19,658
Meanwhile, I get to be Sheriff.

384
00:27:21,422 --> 00:27:23,000
Life is sweet, isn't it?

385
00:27:26,116 --> 00:27:27,196
Gisborne!

386
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,834
- Gisborne!
- Save your breath. I know him.

387
00:27:33,629 --> 00:27:35,716
He won't be coming back.

388
00:27:43,718 --> 00:27:45,685
You're a pretty little thing,
aren't you?

389
00:27:45,805 --> 00:27:47,355
And you're the devil!

390
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:48,794
Feisty, too.

391
00:27:49,243 --> 00:27:52,080
Hood certainly likes
his ladies spirited, doesn't he?

392
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:54,356
I bet he loves Isabella.

393
00:27:55,517 --> 00:27:57,920
- Isabella?
- Oh, come on, spill the beans.

394
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,760
Has she turned up yet
with an urgent message?

395
00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:06,880
Robin can't stand Isabella. Why on earth
would he have anything to do with her?

396
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,076
Oh, how sweet! You're jealous.

397
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,276
I am not jealous of her!

398
00:28:14,739 --> 00:28:16,800
Why should Hoody have all the fun?

399
00:28:18,105 --> 00:28:21,299
Why don't you go down
and relax in the dungeons?

400
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,678
I'll pop down later
for a little chat

401
00:28:24,841 --> 00:28:26,844
<i>à deux</i>, as it were.

402
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:31,103
If I'd just seen them take her,
I would've gone back.

403
00:28:31,223 --> 00:28:32,396
I would've.

404
00:28:34,472 --> 00:28:35,474
I just...

405
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:40,256
- I'd do anything for her.
- Here!

406
00:28:46,431 --> 00:28:47,608
There.

407
00:28:48,831 --> 00:28:52,396
- Thank you.
- It's bitter, but it's quite safe.

408
00:28:54,036 --> 00:28:55,890
- Here we go.
- Here.

409
00:28:58,267 --> 00:29:02,267
This is good, but it won't keep them
going for long. What do we do now?

410
00:29:17,447 --> 00:29:18,450
Well?

411
00:29:19,219 --> 00:29:21,356
She was as you suspected.

412
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:23,757
She followed Hood?

413
00:29:24,146 --> 00:29:25,160
She did.

414
00:29:26,785 --> 00:29:27,786
And?

415
00:29:30,316 --> 00:29:32,026
And I solved the problem, sire.

416
00:29:32,146 --> 00:29:36,000
Oh, please, don't get all enigmatic
on me, Gisborne. Are they dead?

417
00:29:38,675 --> 00:29:39,676
Yes.

418
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:45,476
Well, have a drink, man.
It's not every day you can celebrate

419
00:29:45,596 --> 00:29:48,038
killing a national treasure
and one's own sister.

420
00:29:48,158 --> 00:29:50,352
No, I don't want a drink, sire.

421
00:29:52,316 --> 00:29:55,566
I merely ask that you fulfil
your side of the bargain.

422
00:29:57,554 --> 00:29:58,756
You're right.

423
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:02,916
You're owed that much, at least.
There you are.

424
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,430
The keys to Nottingham.

425
00:30:14,196 --> 00:30:15,480
My lords, ladies,

426
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:19,799
never let it be said that I am a man
who does not deliver on his promises.

427
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:23,003
Robin Hood... is dead...

428
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:28,661
... executed
by my loyal friend here.

429
00:30:29,149 --> 00:30:32,916
My lords and ladies,
I give you Sir Guy of Gisborne,

430
00:30:33,036 --> 00:30:35,120
the new Sheriff of Nottingham!

431
00:30:36,858 --> 00:30:38,636
<i>Sheriff of Nottingham!</i>

432
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:53,830
So go on, do tell.

433
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:55,796
Did they squeal?

434
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,996
I tried to shift the stone
blocking the overflow.

435
00:31:11,448 --> 00:31:12,640
It's too heavy.

436
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,350
Would you mind holding me?
I'm freezing.

437
00:31:15,721 --> 00:31:16,723
Here...

438
00:31:19,838 --> 00:31:22,584
We must be the only two people
in the whole of England

439
00:31:22,704 --> 00:31:24,640
who are cold and wet right now.

440
00:31:32,593 --> 00:31:33,708
You know...

441
00:31:35,295 --> 00:31:38,276
- ... I had a dream about you and me.
- Did you?

442
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:40,639
What was it?

443
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,199
I dreamt that we...
we lived together.

444
00:31:47,595 --> 00:31:50,120
We lived in a... in a farmhouse,

445
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,476
had a few animals,
grew all our own food.

446
00:31:56,421 --> 00:31:58,225
And we had children.

447
00:32:00,945 --> 00:32:02,022
How many?

448
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:03,883
Four.

449
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:07,220
Two girls, two boys.

450
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,894
Freckles on their little noses.

451
00:32:13,305 --> 00:32:16,703
The boys had your strength
and your courage...

452
00:32:16,866 --> 00:32:18,796
And the girls your brains?

453
00:32:19,465 --> 00:32:21,006
We were so happy.

454
00:32:27,156 --> 00:32:29,856
- You probably think it's ridiculous.
- No.

455
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:32,789
It sounds...

456
00:32:35,636 --> 00:32:37,325
... sort of perfect.

457
00:32:44,194 --> 00:32:45,954
- What's that?
- What?

458
00:32:47,501 --> 00:32:49,823
There, that's a ring.
Take your dress off.

459
00:32:49,943 --> 00:32:53,058
- What?
- Take it off. I can make a rope.

460
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,990
I can get an arrow
through that ring.

461
00:32:57,017 --> 00:33:00,817
- We can get out of here, Isabella.
- Yeah, sounds so simple,

462
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:04,250
getting a tiny little arrow
through that tiny ring!

463
00:33:04,417 --> 00:33:06,000
You're forgetting one thing.

464
00:33:06,506 --> 00:33:09,324
- What?
- I'm Robin Hood.

465
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:13,840
How much further to the river, Tuck?

466
00:33:14,548 --> 00:33:18,400
We're nearly there, very nearly.
I can feel it.

467
00:33:24,076 --> 00:33:26,080
- Look, let me carry him.
- No.

468
00:33:31,372 --> 00:33:32,836
<i>Hold on, Isabella.</i>

469
00:33:33,618 --> 00:33:34,996
Where's the bow?

470
00:33:41,476 --> 00:33:43,276
All right? All right...

471
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,514
hold on...

472
00:34:15,672 --> 00:34:16,674
Yes!

473
00:34:20,787 --> 00:34:22,337
I told you I'd do it!

474
00:34:24,214 --> 00:34:28,172
Right. I'll climb up first,
and then I'll pull you up, all right?

475
00:34:40,476 --> 00:34:42,700
I've got one of Hood's gang
downstairs,

476
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:45,700
a girl, would you believe?
You'd like her.

477
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:49,159
- Fancy a gander?
- The perfect end to a perfect day.

478
00:35:36,909 --> 00:35:37,962
Reach!

479
00:35:49,005 --> 00:35:50,345
I've got you.

480
00:35:51,122 --> 00:35:52,137
Come on.

481
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,727
Come on!

482
00:36:02,937 --> 00:36:04,453
Come on! Come on!

483
00:36:05,971 --> 00:36:07,996
Thank you, thank you so much!

484
00:36:08,497 --> 00:36:10,600
- Thank you!
- We're not safe yet.

485
00:36:10,994 --> 00:36:13,116
- Careful. Watch out.
<i>- Robin!</i>

486
00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:16,320
Kate?

487
00:36:18,107 --> 00:36:19,396
What happened?

488
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,076
We tried to get to the river,
but I got caught. You can't trust her.

489
00:36:23,196 --> 00:36:24,720
We've got to get out of here.

490
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,897
It's only a matter of time
before someone comes down.

491
00:36:28,017 --> 00:36:30,167
I can't just leave her, Isabella.

492
00:36:30,627 --> 00:36:32,556
- We've got a chance to escape...
- Robin!

493
00:36:32,676 --> 00:36:35,574
... to escape our old lives.
We've got to take this chance.

494
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:36,720
Listen!

495
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:40,964
What we talked about down there,

496
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:42,321
the dream,

497
00:36:44,019 --> 00:36:45,760
it can be our dream,

498
00:36:46,847 --> 00:36:48,276
our reality...

499
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,040
- ... but we'd have to go now!
- Isabella...

500
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,756
... I like you.

501
00:36:56,252 --> 00:36:57,492
I really do.

502
00:36:59,061 --> 00:37:01,040
But I'm afraid, for me,

503
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:04,676
- it'll always be just a dream.
- What?

504
00:37:06,636 --> 00:37:09,545
Whether I like it or not,
and believe me, sometimes...

505
00:37:09,665 --> 00:37:10,897
I hate it...

506
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:17,359
... but I am Robin Hood,
I am an outlaw...

507
00:37:18,956 --> 00:37:22,756
- ... and I can't change that.
- Surely, Robin, surely in time...

508
00:37:23,098 --> 00:37:26,356
we could just start afresh,
become someone new.

509
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,446
- Please...
- No. No. I am who I am.

510
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,400
I tried to have it all
once before...

511
00:37:34,196 --> 00:37:36,833
... but it just caused
so much pain for everyone.

512
00:37:36,953 --> 00:37:38,449
No! I'm not her!

513
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,996
I'm truly sorry.

514
00:37:43,597 --> 00:37:44,599
No!

515
00:37:46,235 --> 00:37:47,236
You?

516
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,236
Quick! Go get the guards.

517
00:37:53,584 --> 00:37:56,405
Dead, you said.
Taken care of, you said.

518
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:58,400
- He's always lied, sire.
- Isabella!

519
00:37:58,953 --> 00:38:02,423
In fact, he was going to let me go
and not tell you about it...

520
00:38:02,543 --> 00:38:04,577
- No!
- Until I knocked him unconscious.

521
00:38:04,697 --> 00:38:06,880
- No, sire.
- You've let the team down, Guy.

522
00:38:07,203 --> 00:38:09,777
You've let yourself down.
In fact, you're a liability.

523
00:38:09,897 --> 00:38:13,097
- Gisborne, you're fired!
- No! You will not fire me.

524
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:17,391
I've waited all my life to be Sheriff
and I will NOT be fired by you!

525
00:38:18,325 --> 00:38:19,977
How dare you?!

526
00:38:21,247 --> 00:38:24,720
- How dare you threaten the monarch?!
- You're not a monarch.

527
00:38:24,881 --> 00:38:27,676
You're a pretender, a fake, a fraud!

528
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,196
No, no, not as big a fraud as him.

529
00:38:30,765 --> 00:38:32,516
I've been a fool, sire -

530
00:38:32,636 --> 00:38:35,996
a weak, vain woman
blinded by his flattery.

531
00:38:36,889 --> 00:38:38,956
But now I see the truth,

532
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,660
and I beg you, sire, let me show you

533
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,600
- how sorry I am.
- Put it...

534
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,680
Save your honeyed words
for someone who cares...

535
00:38:47,862 --> 00:38:49,867
- Hood.
- Be my guest!

536
00:39:55,464 --> 00:39:56,464
Guy...

537
00:39:57,955 --> 00:39:59,120
Goodbye, Isabella.

538
00:40:09,194 --> 00:40:11,640
It's...
it's not meant to be like this!

539
00:40:12,946 --> 00:40:16,200
Your days as a free man are over,
Gisborne! They're over!

540
00:40:20,996 --> 00:40:21,996
<i>Guards!</i>

541
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,104
<i>Guards! I'm down here with the Prince!
Come and help us!</i>

542
00:40:27,572 --> 00:40:31,160
- You're a dead man walking, Gisborne.
- Never seemed to do you much harm.

543
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,280
Robin!

544
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,931
- This isn't over, Hood.
- You can count on it!

545
00:40:58,051 --> 00:40:59,751
Robin, Robin, leave him.

546
00:40:59,944 --> 00:41:01,898
We've got to save ourselves.

547
00:41:02,795 --> 00:41:04,680
- This way, come on.
- Wait.

548
00:41:08,131 --> 00:41:11,040
- Thanks.
- Come on, we need to open the hatch.

549
00:41:20,521 --> 00:41:22,062
Come on, come on!

550
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:24,633
We're here!

551
00:41:28,233 --> 00:41:29,461
I'm sorry...

552
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,334
I'm so sorry.

553
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,282
No!
Please, God, no!

554
00:41:39,868 --> 00:41:40,870
Wait.

555
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,160
Look. There's water.

556
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,316
- Look!
- Thank the Lord!

557
00:42:03,065 --> 00:42:04,530
Thank the Lord?

558
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,135
Thank Robin.

559
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,260
It's full again!

560
00:42:14,276 --> 00:42:16,168
The water's come back!

561
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:19,876
Jack, that's brilliant!

562
00:42:23,255 --> 00:42:24,876
Here, drink this.

563
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,124
- This is what you do.
- And you do it well!

564
00:42:38,916 --> 00:42:41,076
No. We do it well.

565
00:42:53,785 --> 00:42:55,000
So come on, then.

566
00:42:56,731 --> 00:42:59,116
- What happened with Isabella?
- Isabella...

567
00:42:59,236 --> 00:43:03,196
Well, let's just say Isabella
won't be joining us just yet.

568
00:43:04,171 --> 00:43:05,236
Eh, Kate?

569
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,916
People of Nottingham, the king is dead.
Long live the King!

570
00:43:36,798 --> 00:43:38,680
- Do you love me?
<i>- He's not dead!</i>

571
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,240
<i>I'd know if he was dead,</i>
I'd feel it!

572
00:43:41,993 --> 00:43:42,993
Tim.

573
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,520
Wakey-wakey, Archbishop.
You've got a coronation to attend.

574
00:43:46,806 --> 00:43:48,683
And no-one to stop me!

575
00:43:48,803 --> 00:43:51,116
You will make me tipsy.

576
00:43:51,481 --> 00:43:53,160
You will get what you deserve!

577
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,689
For a coronation to take place,
you need a crown.

578
00:43:55,809 --> 00:43:57,476
So we steal his crown.
