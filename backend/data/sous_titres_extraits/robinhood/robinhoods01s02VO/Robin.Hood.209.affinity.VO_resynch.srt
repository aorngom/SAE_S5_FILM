1
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:07,909
Excuse me.

2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,353
Guy, there's a messenger
outside with a letter.

3
00:00:13,473 --> 00:00:16,234
He's insisting he gives it to
the Lord Of The Manor in person.

4
00:00:16,354 --> 00:00:19,949
- Is it from Lady Marian?
- No, he says it's from the King.

5
00:00:20,807 --> 00:00:21,901
The King?

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,527
So where is he, then?

7
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:28,757
Well, he was here a minute ago.

8
00:00:28,877 --> 00:00:31,055
He thought Robin was still
Lord Of The Manor.

9
00:00:31,175 --> 00:00:32,977
Maybe he found out he wasn't
and ran off.

10
00:00:33,097 --> 00:00:36,679
- And what fool told him that?
- It's not a secte, is it?

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,840
Fool!

12
00:00:38,226 --> 00:00:40,250
- Get after him! I want that letter!
- Yeah.

13
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,537
Yeah. He won't get far.
He's only on foot. Ha!

14
00:00:44,195 --> 00:00:45,648
Hey. Guards, come on!

15
00:00:47,805 --> 00:00:49,497
Happy Birthday, Gisborne.

16
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:52,639
- Party going well, is it?
- We've got a problem.

17
00:01:00,845 --> 00:01:03,200
Just give us the letter and
we'll let you go, all right?

18
00:01:24,338 --> 00:01:25,709
<i>Oi! Over 'ere.</i>

19
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,791
<i>Come along!</i>

20
00:01:28,584 --> 00:01:31,399
<i>Look, you've got the most
distinctive tracks in the forest.</i>

21
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,039
<i>- You might as well give up now!
- This way!</i>

22
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:25,017
Give us the message from the King.

23
00:02:25,137 --> 00:02:27,252
It's for Robin Of
Locksley and his eyes only.

24
00:02:27,372 --> 00:02:30,122
Just give it to me
or we'll take it from you.

25
00:02:38,176 --> 00:02:40,839
Don't you know it's rude
to read other people's mail?!

26
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,480
Sub Wood Team
http://subwoodteam.free.fr/forum/

27
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,764
Moochie

28
00:03:21,921 --> 00:03:24,733
By the time you get close
enough to use those swords,

29
00:03:24,853 --> 00:03:27,890
you'll be so full of arrows,
you'll look like hedgehogs.

30
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:33,899
So...

31
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,081
This is what Gisborne's
dogsbody does, is it?

32
00:03:37,201 --> 00:03:40,228
I'm not his dogsbody.
I'm his right-hand man.

33
00:03:42,369 --> 00:03:43,999
I couldn't face myself in the morning,

34
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:46,479
- if I was you.
- I count my money in the morning.

35
00:03:46,641 --> 00:03:49,200
While you are squabbling,
there's a man in agony over there.

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,637
Run back to your master.

37
00:03:51,944 --> 00:03:52,980
Go on.

38
00:03:54,425 --> 00:03:55,465
Go on!

39
00:03:57,205 --> 00:03:58,264
RUN!

40
00:03:59,624 --> 00:04:02,000
Do you practise
little speeches like that?

41
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,144
Like what?

42
00:04:03,264 --> 00:04:06,037
"You'll be so full of arrows,
you'll look like hedgehogs."

43
00:04:06,157 --> 00:04:09,077
- No, it just came to mind.
- You practise, don't you?

44
00:04:09,197 --> 00:04:10,039
No.

45
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:13,308
- Robin...
- Ssh-sh-sh-sh.

46
00:04:13,993 --> 00:04:15,082
I know you.

47
00:04:17,154 --> 00:04:18,738
Save your strength.

48
00:04:19,406 --> 00:04:20,519
Lardner...

49
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:24,726
Lardner!

50
00:04:32,712 --> 00:04:35,373
It's the royal seal. It is from Richard.

51
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:40,617
So, where are they, Gisborne?

52
00:04:40,737 --> 00:04:43,477
- They'll be here.
- Woodcock, Sir Guy.

53
00:04:43,597 --> 00:04:44,875
Birthday treat.

54
00:04:46,365 --> 00:04:47,753
Shall I get started?

55
00:04:48,374 --> 00:04:49,425
If you must.

56
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:52,559
Your men had better get
to him before Robin does.

57
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:58,457
He wants reinforcements.

58
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:00,271
He wants more men.

59
00:05:00,627 --> 00:05:03,959
He still has got no idea. He has
no idea what's happening in England.

60
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:07,134
The message you sent with Carter.
It can't have reached the King yet.

61
00:05:07,254 --> 00:05:10,777
Many a courier gets intercepted.
The proof of that's right here.

62
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,097
He wants me to send...

63
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:15,540
a note back with... Lardner,

64
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,759
telling him how many men
I can recruit and when I'll arrive.

65
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,738
Well, you can't do that now, can you ?

66
00:05:22,346 --> 00:05:23,360
But...

67
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:26,320
This... This isn't Lardner. This...

68
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,244
This is McLellan.
This is Lawrence McLellan.

69
00:05:29,364 --> 00:05:31,323
Well, then who's Lardner?

70
00:05:37,454 --> 00:05:40,017
Richard The Lionheart, they call him.

71
00:05:41,048 --> 00:05:43,110
Going into battle in a foreign land,

72
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,439
it's not the heart
of a lion you want, is it?

73
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:49,377
Since when did a heart hurt anybody?

74
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,708
Come on then! Come on!

75
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:55,498
I've got the heart of a lion!

76
00:05:57,707 --> 00:06:01,177
You can imagine the Saracens
translating that, can't you?

77
00:06:03,123 --> 00:06:05,690
He's got the what of a lion? The teeth?

78
00:06:07,384 --> 00:06:08,400
The jaws?

79
00:06:08,813 --> 00:06:09,826
The claws?

80
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:14,282
No! The heart!

81
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,977
Richard The Lion Claw,
Jerusalem's yours.

82
00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:20,376
Come in. Sit down. Help yourself!

83
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:22,778
Lion Heart?

84
00:06:25,217 --> 00:06:27,279
- It's good, very good.
- Forget about it.

85
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:30,777
It's no wonder it's taking
him so long over there, is it?

86
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:36,811
Mind you, mind you...

87
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:40,257
It's better than his brother, isn't it?

88
00:06:40,573 --> 00:06:41,830
Prince John.

89
00:06:42,991 --> 00:06:44,617
What's Prince John doing?

90
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,937
Sitting at home, heart of a dormouse?

91
00:06:48,346 --> 00:06:50,550
Prince John is a friend of mine!

92
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,545
It's a joke. It's what I do.

93
00:06:52,665 --> 00:06:54,799
I do other things.
Let's try some soothsaying.

94
00:06:54,961 --> 00:06:58,680
Sit down. I'll make some predictions
and then I'll make them come true.

95
00:06:58,841 --> 00:07:02,312
Someone in this room will bare
their buttocks to the Sheriff tonight.

96
00:07:02,432 --> 00:07:04,360
Take that man to the dungeons now!

97
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,467
No, hang on. Prediction two, Sir
Guy's joint will rise from the dead.

98
00:07:08,587 --> 00:07:11,638
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Your woodcock, Sir Guy,

99
00:07:11,758 --> 00:07:13,839
- I can bring it back to life.
- Get rid of him!

100
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,999
My third prediction's about Prince John.

101
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:18,126
One day Prince John
will be King of England.

102
00:07:18,246 --> 00:07:19,398
I know that already.

103
00:07:19,518 --> 00:07:21,795
But did you know something
in Nottingham can stop him?

104
00:07:21,915 --> 00:07:24,377
- Like what?
- Lardner's Ring.

105
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:28,817
- What is Lardner's Ring?
- Well, let me go and I'll tell you.

106
00:07:28,937 --> 00:07:31,793
Lock him in the cell overnight,
flog him in the morning

107
00:07:31,913 --> 00:07:35,361
and then he'll tell us.
Now that really is funny!

108
00:07:38,081 --> 00:07:40,519
You should listen to me!
I know what I'm talking about.

109
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:47,543
The first prediction! I told you!
And the others will follow.

110
00:07:47,663 --> 00:07:50,239
Beware the power of Lardner's Ring.

111
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:53,719
What is Lardner's Ring?

112
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:03,640
I know I'm meant to be loyal
and obedient, but

113
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:06,611
the King doesn't know the facts.

114
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:08,937
And once he does, then he'll turn home.

115
00:08:09,641 --> 00:08:12,807
And this is no time for you
to go back to the Holy Land.

116
00:08:13,803 --> 00:08:15,468
We're agreed then.

117
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:20,645
Absolutely.

118
00:08:29,971 --> 00:08:31,959
Would you like to say a few words?

119
00:08:40,382 --> 00:08:41,439
Go on then.

120
00:08:45,263 --> 00:08:46,639
Will you marry me?

121
00:08:49,058 --> 00:08:50,094
What?

122
00:08:57,319 --> 00:09:01,279
The first time I held my bow, I knew.

123
00:09:03,088 --> 00:09:04,410
It felt right.

124
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,280
Like it had been made for me.

125
00:09:09,737 --> 00:09:11,840
And that's how I feel about you.

126
00:09:14,478 --> 00:09:18,086
I promised your father
I would protect and look after you.

127
00:09:21,356 --> 00:09:22,989
But it works both ways.

128
00:09:24,754 --> 00:09:27,998
I look after my bow because
it protects and looks after me.

129
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:34,079
Together we're stronger.

130
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:42,826
So...

131
00:09:53,038 --> 00:09:54,039
Marian.

132
00:09:54,942 --> 00:09:56,264
Will you marry me?

133
00:10:01,924 --> 00:10:04,543
Robin, of every single man in the world,

134
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:08,709
- you are the only one...
- Is that a yes?

135
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:11,735
- Will you let me finish?
- I'm sorry.

136
00:10:13,075 --> 00:10:15,032
The only one who would

137
00:10:15,772 --> 00:10:16,838
propose

138
00:10:17,188 --> 00:10:18,732
over a fresh grave

139
00:10:19,595 --> 00:10:22,811
- by comparing me to your weapon.
- Well, is that a no?

140
00:10:24,203 --> 00:10:26,933
- Who will give me away?
- I can ask the King.

141
00:10:30,979 --> 00:10:33,917
So we find Lardner
and bring the King home.

142
00:10:35,816 --> 00:10:37,220
Defeat the Sheriff

143
00:10:38,964 --> 00:10:40,639
and then we get married.

144
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,279
That sounds like a plan.

145
00:10:56,999 --> 00:10:58,386
Move, you worm!

146
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,196
Right.

147
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:08,928
What's that?!

148
00:11:10,105 --> 00:11:11,137
It's a dove.

149
00:11:11,394 --> 00:11:13,337
Well, I've seen it all now!

150
00:11:17,106 --> 00:11:19,797
Here, why do you keep
a bird in your pocket?

151
00:11:20,267 --> 00:11:23,617
Why do you keep a worm in your pants?

152
00:11:24,735 --> 00:11:26,839
You should keep an eye
on that belt of yours!

153
00:11:36,081 --> 00:11:37,284
Where is he?

154
00:11:38,595 --> 00:11:40,650
- He's dead.
- What about the message?

155
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,203
Well, we got part of it, yeah.

156
00:11:42,717 --> 00:11:45,006
- But Robin turned up...
- Turned up?!

157
00:11:45,616 --> 00:11:48,686
- And got his message?
- I don't know.

158
00:11:49,454 --> 00:11:51,159
Look, he kinda took us by surprise.

159
00:11:52,346 --> 00:11:55,239
All we heard him say
was "Lardner", that was it.

160
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,453
Lardner. That's what he said.

161
00:12:03,961 --> 00:12:05,751
I blame you for this!

162
00:12:06,588 --> 00:12:09,641
You had him on your doorstep
and you let him escape?!

163
00:12:10,241 --> 00:12:11,839
You and your imbeciles!

164
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:13,421
Six legs

165
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:16,397
against one and the one

166
00:12:16,925 --> 00:12:17,970
got away!

167
00:12:31,975 --> 00:12:33,537
There's an explanation.

168
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,764
There is always a rational explanation.

169
00:12:40,441 --> 00:12:43,342
We know McLellan
and the Fool spoke together,

170
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:46,147
so something was said
about the ring of Lardner.

171
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:48,009
Maybe it's got
a coded inscription on it.

172
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:49,197
It's no problem.

173
00:12:49,317 --> 00:12:52,605
We'll just torture the Fool
until he tells us.

174
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:55,246
He's disappeared!

175
00:12:58,641 --> 00:13:00,991
I know that, you blithering oaf!

176
00:13:14,717 --> 00:13:17,467
Know anyone called Lardner?

177
00:13:18,392 --> 00:13:19,720
Have you ever known

178
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,470
or heard of anyone

179
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:25,062
or anything called Lardner?

180
00:13:27,921 --> 00:13:30,759
Lardner's Ring?
What is it? What is it?

181
00:13:35,407 --> 00:13:37,879
Tell us where it is or we will take

182
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:40,713
every ring in this village.

183
00:13:42,931 --> 00:13:46,850
- It must be some kind of ring tax.
- Allan's with them.

184
00:13:49,824 --> 00:13:52,795
Leave me alone! I don't know anything.

185
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,439
Right, you've had your chance.
Lose the ring

186
00:13:59,184 --> 00:14:00,414
or lose the finger.

187
00:14:01,244 --> 00:14:04,101
Somebody knows where Lardner is.

188
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:07,839
- Did he say Lardner?
- Does that mean something to you?

189
00:14:08,638 --> 00:14:09,680
So,

190
00:14:10,313 --> 00:14:11,879
when the sand runs out...

191
00:14:13,565 --> 00:14:15,617
the finger... comes off!

192
00:14:18,957 --> 00:14:21,656
Much, when we were in the Holy Land,

193
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,999
do you remember anybody called Lardner?

194
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:26,639
- No. Why?
- Because I have to find him.

195
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:31,501
Where's, er... Where's Will and Djaq?

196
00:14:31,864 --> 00:14:34,479
They said
they've gone to get some honey.

197
00:14:34,784 --> 00:14:38,060
- They'll be back soon.
- If that's what they've gone for.

198
00:14:38,732 --> 00:14:40,740
But why does it need two of them?

199
00:14:41,115 --> 00:14:43,079
Honey is one of those things.

200
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,443
- What things?
- What do you call it when you use

201
00:14:46,563 --> 00:14:49,080
a sweet innocent word but what
you really mean is something else?

202
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,799
- A lie.
- No.

203
00:14:50,961 --> 00:14:53,282
- A euphemism?
- A euphemism.

204
00:14:53,969 --> 00:14:55,119
Exactly!

205
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,487
Yes. There's a bit too much honey
going on around here if you ask me.

206
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,111
Will and Djaq nipping off together.

207
00:15:02,231 --> 00:15:04,881
You two going for long walks
in the forest.

208
00:15:05,056 --> 00:15:06,253
He's jealous.

209
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:10,292
What happened to fighting for justice
and rebelling against the Sheriff?

210
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:12,550
We should be sticking together!

211
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,045
Instead, we're splitting into couples.

212
00:15:15,847 --> 00:15:17,594
To be perfectly honest...

213
00:15:18,577 --> 00:15:20,319
I don't fancy mine much.

214
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:25,057
Anyway, while you two
have been off gallivanting...

215
00:15:25,177 --> 00:15:27,217
We haven't been gallivanting!

216
00:15:27,337 --> 00:15:28,719
I know what you've been up to.

217
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:30,999
We've been burying
a corpse in the forest.

218
00:15:33,979 --> 00:15:35,628
Is that a euphemism?

219
00:15:40,192 --> 00:15:42,479
Speak now and spare this woman's finger.

220
00:15:42,872 --> 00:15:46,431
Say nothing and your silence
proves your guilt.

221
00:15:47,092 --> 00:15:49,657
- Can we risk it?
- Yeah, we have to.

222
00:15:49,777 --> 00:15:52,639
I'll take him the long way round,
lead him away from camp.

223
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,453
Stop!

224
00:15:56,385 --> 00:15:57,937
I know who Lardner is.

225
00:15:58,619 --> 00:15:59,920
And I know about his ring.

226
00:16:00,946 --> 00:16:03,359
- Let the woman go.
- You're in Robin Hood's gang?

227
00:16:03,521 --> 00:16:05,271
Let the woman go!

228
00:16:09,686 --> 00:16:10,836
Now...

229
00:16:11,167 --> 00:16:12,679
tell me about Lardner.

230
00:16:13,787 --> 00:16:15,777
You'll have to catch us first!

231
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,418
Get after 'em!

232
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,859
That way!

233
00:17:16,337 --> 00:17:18,681
Whoa! Whoa! Hold there, horsey!

234
00:17:19,386 --> 00:17:21,581
This is my lucky day, this is !

235
00:17:26,036 --> 00:17:27,609
Or it was.

236
00:17:31,357 --> 00:17:32,366
Robin?

237
00:17:33,704 --> 00:17:35,478
- What's happened?
- It's Gisborne.

238
00:17:35,598 --> 00:17:37,794
He's at Locksley,
terrorising the people.

239
00:17:37,914 --> 00:17:40,568
- What?
- He's searching for Lardner's Ring.

240
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,357
Gisborne The Gullible.
I've got something to show you.

241
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,217
First you see it, then you don't.

242
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:53,567
- There it is. And there it isn't.
- What's your point?

243
00:17:57,271 --> 00:17:58,921
How did you do that?

244
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,840
You simply pull up on the handle,
the claw grabs hold of the bird.

245
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:06,983
You lift up the lid, the bird's gone.

246
00:18:08,923 --> 00:18:12,253
The cooked bird has been
hollowed out, you put a live dove

247
00:18:12,373 --> 00:18:14,739
inside it and lah di dah di dah...

248
00:18:15,043 --> 00:18:16,727
A plate full of bird's wings.

249
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:20,397
Your Fool, he's no sorcerer,
he's no soothsayer.

250
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,422
And he cannot predict the future.

251
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:24,757
He was right about
Lardner's Ring though.

252
00:18:24,877 --> 00:18:26,205
Bring 'em in!

253
00:18:36,864 --> 00:18:39,317
Back home, my uncle had a friend.

254
00:18:39,521 --> 00:18:41,907
The Sultan's official pigeon handler.

255
00:18:42,881 --> 00:18:44,279
He handles pigeons?

256
00:18:44,441 --> 00:18:47,960
- Yes, he handles pigeons.
- A job, I suppose.

257
00:18:48,536 --> 00:18:50,959
It's a very important job, Much!

258
00:18:52,407 --> 00:18:55,885
Now, the Sultan's very best pigeon,

259
00:18:56,684 --> 00:18:57,834
the smallest

260
00:18:58,529 --> 00:18:59,879
and quickest one,

261
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,855
was a pigeon called Lardner.

262
00:19:05,523 --> 00:19:06,531
Right.

263
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:09,677
Right. Does he have a ring?

264
00:19:10,033 --> 00:19:12,873
And if he does,
what's so special about it?

265
00:19:13,266 --> 00:19:16,199
The Saracens use
pigeons to carry messages.

266
00:19:16,361 --> 00:19:19,232
They put the message on a little
ring tied to the bird's foot

267
00:19:19,352 --> 00:19:20,930
and then they let it fly off.

268
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,723
It doesn't matter how far away the
bird is when you let it go,

269
00:19:23,843 --> 00:19:25,879
because it will always
find its way home.

270
00:19:26,307 --> 00:19:28,135
Carrying the message with it.

271
00:19:28,641 --> 00:19:31,324
But it isn't their home
they are searching for.

272
00:19:31,814 --> 00:19:33,382
It is their mate.

273
00:19:34,078 --> 00:19:37,736
All you have to do
is split the two of them up.

274
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,567
And a pigeon

275
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,835
will carry a message
to the ends of the Earth,

276
00:19:43,069 --> 00:19:45,758
faster and straighter
than any man ever could,

277
00:19:46,521 --> 00:19:49,140
just to be with the one they love.

278
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:54,095
So we could get a message to King
Richard, half away across the world,

279
00:19:54,215 --> 00:19:56,999
- in no time at all?
- A matter of days.

280
00:19:58,577 --> 00:19:59,920
That's incredible!

281
00:20:00,635 --> 00:20:01,840
My question is,

282
00:20:02,544 --> 00:20:05,300
why is the Sultan's best pigeon

283
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:08,124
being used by King Richard?

284
00:20:08,244 --> 00:20:10,404
Maybe they've formed an alliance
or something.

285
00:20:10,524 --> 00:20:12,331
Or maybe King Richard

286
00:20:12,643 --> 00:20:14,560
and his army have helped themselves.

287
00:20:16,297 --> 00:20:17,800
If they've got Lardner,

288
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,350
they've got the Sultan.

289
00:20:21,717 --> 00:20:23,711
And if they've got the Sultan,

290
00:20:24,627 --> 00:20:26,194
they've got everyone.

291
00:20:33,363 --> 00:20:35,306
We have to go back to the tree.

292
00:20:35,961 --> 00:20:38,264
So that's what he had in his box.

293
00:20:38,384 --> 00:20:40,679
And the only place he
could've left it is up that tree.

294
00:20:40,841 --> 00:20:44,370
You make me sick, you know that?
Betraying your old friends.

295
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:48,158
I hope you're enjoying it, Allan.
I couldn't live with myself.

296
00:20:48,278 --> 00:20:50,657
Ah well, you won't have to
for much longer, you see.

297
00:20:50,777 --> 00:20:54,607
The penalty for being
in Robin Hood's gang is death!

298
00:20:55,176 --> 00:20:57,936
Right, well. I'm glad I
could have been of service,

299
00:20:58,056 --> 00:20:59,920
I think my work here is done.
Can I go now?

300
00:21:00,201 --> 00:21:02,253
You can go, of course. With him,

301
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:04,680
to the gallows. Hang them both!

302
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,177
And feed their carcasses to the birds.

303
00:21:09,123 --> 00:21:11,437
Come along, Gisborne. No time to lose.

304
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:15,240
No, please. Have mercy.
Don't let them do this to me!

305
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:22,333
I do comedy, I don't do tragedy.

306
00:21:22,453 --> 00:21:24,960
Please.

307
00:21:26,354 --> 00:21:27,435
Well, seeing you swing
will be comedy, won't it?

308
00:21:35,797 --> 00:21:39,278
Very good.

309
00:21:39,768 --> 00:21:42,666
If Robin gets the bird,
it means the King knows our plans.

310
00:21:42,786 --> 00:21:45,642
And the last thing we need
is the King and his army

311
00:21:46,135 --> 00:21:49,531
coming back to England
before we're ready for them.

312
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:52,213
So we must catch the pigeon.

313
00:21:59,637 --> 00:22:02,397
Catch the pigeon now.

314
00:22:02,517 --> 00:22:06,117
But if we wait for Will
then we can all go together!

315
00:22:06,237 --> 00:22:09,639
- We have to go now. Come on.
- And if Allan returns with more men?

316
00:22:09,801 --> 00:22:13,199
If they knew where Lardner was, they
wouldn't have terrorised the village.

317
00:22:13,713 --> 00:22:14,774
We won't be long. Work on the message
until we get back. Now give me the rope.

318
00:22:45,694 --> 00:22:48,879
Good luck.

319
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:51,805
Do you think a bird could fly that
distance and still find its way home?

320
00:22:53,987 --> 00:22:55,489
The dove found its way back
to Noah's Ark.

321
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:58,119
How do they do it?

322
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:05,974
They just follow their hearts.

323
00:23:06,401 --> 00:23:08,266
Won't be long.

324
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,519
You take your time. No rush.

325
00:23:12,681 --> 00:23:14,637
Do you think that contraption's
strong enough to hold the us?

326
00:23:14,918 --> 00:23:17,119
Last a lifetime, that will.

327
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:20,597
Huh-heh! At least your lifetime!

328
00:23:21,492 --> 00:23:23,125
I could do your job.

329
00:23:47,561 --> 00:23:48,839
I couldn't do yours.

330
00:23:50,732 --> 00:23:52,153
Can you see it?

331
00:23:56,915 --> 00:23:58,357
That's it, I think.

332
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:00,320
Can you reach it?

333
00:24:07,043 --> 00:24:09,378
I'm nearly there.

334
00:24:14,984 --> 00:24:16,894
Robin! Robin, the Sheriff's coming.

335
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:21,903
And Gisborne's with him!

336
00:24:22,338 --> 00:24:24,624
Run!

337
00:24:29,011 --> 00:24:30,333
Go without me! I'll hold them off!

338
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:33,209
Hang on, stop.

339
00:24:48,358 --> 00:24:49,941
Yeah, that's the tree.

340
00:24:50,581 --> 00:24:51,997
You're surrounded, Hood!

341
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:54,812
You're going nowhere!

342
00:24:59,346 --> 00:25:01,841
Get back on your horse
and get reinforcements!

343
00:25:02,955 --> 00:25:03,962
- What are you doing here?
- Hiding.

344
00:25:05,677 --> 00:25:08,708
Great!

345
00:25:08,828 --> 00:25:10,892
He could just wait until it gets
dark and then release the bird.

346
00:25:12,967 --> 00:25:16,157
He'll be down before nightfall.

347
00:25:16,361 --> 00:25:19,087
"Come home."
No, it needs more immediacy.

348
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:23,146
"Come home now".
"Come home immediately!"

349
00:25:23,266 --> 00:25:25,769
- "Immediately" is better.
- "Immediately" is longer.

350
00:25:25,889 --> 00:25:29,417
- What?!
- Lardner's a pigeon, not an eagle.

351
00:25:29,537 --> 00:25:32,281
- More words, more weight.
- It's one word. Same as "now"!

352
00:25:34,185 --> 00:25:36,525
- Well, then use "now"!
- Too many cooks!

353
00:25:36,645 --> 00:25:39,269
You know, traditionally,
men in your position

354
00:25:39,389 --> 00:25:41,391
offer men in our position
a last request?

355
00:25:41,511 --> 00:25:44,717
I don't hold with tradition.

356
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:46,850
It's just a little thing. Would you
scratch my nose? I've got an itch.

357
00:25:47,283 --> 00:25:49,012
Let the Devil scratch it.

358
00:25:49,532 --> 00:25:51,839
You'll see him soon enough.

359
00:25:52,174 --> 00:25:54,655
Sir Guy's got Robin
Hood trapped up a tree.

360
00:25:55,081 --> 00:25:57,717
He wants every available
man down there now!

361
00:25:57,837 --> 00:26:00,800
- Get your horses! Quick!
- One last chance.

362
00:26:02,507 --> 00:26:03,937
While no-one's looking, let us go
and we'll say no more about it, yeah?

363
00:26:04,116 --> 00:26:06,477
I'm a performer!

364
00:26:06,597 --> 00:26:08,557
I can't die without an audience.

365
00:26:10,623 --> 00:26:12,843
It's an insult to my profession.

366
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,229
I told you to keep an eye on that belt.

367
00:26:16,634 --> 00:26:19,762
Marian,

368
00:26:19,882 --> 00:26:22,978
they don't know you're up here. If I
make a run for it, they'll follow me.

369
00:26:44,641 --> 00:26:46,737
- You can escape with Lardner.
- They're coming back!

370
00:26:46,857 --> 00:26:48,669
That is a complete waste of arrows.

371
00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:50,880
Just giving Allan
something to think about.

372
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,040
Think about us !
We're running out of arrows.

373
00:26:57,978 --> 00:27:01,277
Look! Look, they're retreating.

374
00:27:01,607 --> 00:27:05,222
I have an idea. Do not
let them escape while I'm gone.

375
00:27:11,314 --> 00:27:13,577
- He'll be dead by the time you're back.
- I won't hold my breath.

376
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:16,713
Maybe you could use me as a hostage.

377
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:19,999
- What?
- You know Gisborne's feelings for me.

378
00:27:20,137 --> 00:27:23,047
He might let you go, if he thought
it meant getting me back.

379
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:26,419
- Are you mad?
- I could say I was on my way to him

380
00:27:26,577 --> 00:27:29,800
- and you ambushed me in the forest.
- He'd never fall for it!

381
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:32,704
And how would that look? Robin
Hood takes Lady Marian hostage!

382
00:27:32,949 --> 00:27:35,599
Oh, yes, us dying together
might look better!

383
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,944
- But it won't bring the King home.
- Even if Gisborne fell for it,

384
00:27:38,064 --> 00:27:41,359
- the Sheriff wouldn't.
- The Sheriff's gone!

385
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:43,503
And while Gisborne's in charge...
Robin this could be our last chance.

386
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,243
No! It's not happening.

387
00:27:49,921 --> 00:27:51,697
Robin, have you got a better idea?

388
00:27:52,217 --> 00:27:53,793
Right. "Your Majesty."

389
00:27:53,913 --> 00:27:57,040
"No reinforcements."

390
00:27:58,338 --> 00:28:01,759
- "John plans to steal your throne..."
- "Plots."

391
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,948
- "Plots" is a better word.
- "Plots" is better.

392
00:28:07,177 --> 00:28:09,483
"Your Majesty. No reinforcements."

393
00:28:10,201 --> 00:28:12,640
"John plots to steal your throne."

394
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,617
"Come home, now."

395
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:19,760
Short, sharp and to the point.

396
00:28:20,444 --> 00:28:22,800
I'll add "make peace"
before "come home".

397
00:28:24,385 --> 00:28:26,567
"Make peace immediately."

398
00:28:26,687 --> 00:28:30,457
You know, I do like "immediately".

399
00:28:30,681 --> 00:28:34,057
But it needs more emotion.
Make it bigger! Raise the stakes!

400
00:28:34,773 --> 00:28:37,977
And alliterate! Alliteration
makes it much more memorable.

401
00:28:38,097 --> 00:28:41,817
- Where have you come from?
- I appear. I disappear.

402
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:43,377
It's what I do.
To tell how would spoil the illusion.

403
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,665
He's with me.

404
00:28:46,785 --> 00:28:49,164
- I thought you'd been caught.
- Madam,

405
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:51,479
manacles are mere mist
to myself and my...

406
00:28:52,032 --> 00:28:53,942
my mate.

407
00:28:54,062 --> 00:28:57,475
- You know about the pigeon?
- Yes,

408
00:28:57,595 --> 00:29:00,169
- Robin and Marian have gone to get him.
- So have Sheriff and Gisborne.

409
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:02,028
They've got them trapped
up a tree surrounded.

410
00:29:02,915 --> 00:29:04,095
We need to go. Now!

411
00:29:07,631 --> 00:29:08,741
Immediately!

412
00:29:11,096 --> 00:29:12,537
OK, line up!

413
00:29:13,091 --> 00:29:15,557
You, over there!

414
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:43,775
Let's get him down! Come on! Line up!

415
00:29:44,288 --> 00:29:45,905
Saddle me up another horse,
make it a fast one.

416
00:29:51,801 --> 00:29:54,489
I'll be leaving shortly.

417
00:29:54,609 --> 00:29:56,187
It's just a matter of time now
Hood, start saying your prayers.

418
00:29:56,307 --> 00:29:59,119
If they come any nearer,

419
00:30:01,438 --> 00:30:03,952
they'll get the same.
And I won't be aiming at their feet!

420
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,809
- Give me your arrows.
- It's not enough.

421
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,272
Well, they don't know that, do they?

422
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:10,720
- Ready?
- Yeah.

423
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,687
Move!

424
00:30:19,807 --> 00:30:22,360
I'll scream, then I can say
you were holding me hostage.

425
00:30:22,891 --> 00:30:24,519
You didn't scream earlier.
He's not stupid.

426
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:29,279
I'll deal with this, Marian.

427
00:30:29,918 --> 00:30:32,506
It'll take them hours
to cut down this tree.

428
00:30:32,626 --> 00:30:34,389
And in that time, the gang
will realise something's wrong.

429
00:30:35,365 --> 00:30:36,577
Yeah? They'll come and help.

430
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,173
Come, come.

431
00:30:40,522 --> 00:30:42,204
That's it, stop.

432
00:30:43,311 --> 00:30:45,041
I can't hear an axe.

433
00:30:51,737 --> 00:30:53,519
What are they waiting for?

434
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,193
You know what that is, don't you?

435
00:30:55,635 --> 00:30:57,529
It's pitch.

436
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:03,311
It burns hot and it burns fast.

437
00:31:11,123 --> 00:31:13,119
Go, go, go!

438
00:31:13,582 --> 00:31:14,686
- Much, I think it's this way.
- You think?!

439
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:17,537
Shhh!

440
00:31:17,657 --> 00:31:19,400
Don't tell me to shush!
We're looking for a tree in a forest!

441
00:31:20,533 --> 00:31:22,263
Shut up and listen!

442
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,840
I hope you're ready, Hood!

443
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:31,578
I'm sensing it's that way.

444
00:31:33,961 --> 00:31:36,109
You tried to cover me in pitch
once, Hood, do you remember?

445
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:38,769
Tried to cook me alive
in my own armour.

446
00:31:39,449 --> 00:31:42,986
Yeah!
I should have gone through with it!

447
00:31:45,593 --> 00:31:48,458
Talking trees are good.
But burning bushes are better.

448
00:31:48,578 --> 00:31:50,258
I don't see a trough of
water for you to jump into.

449
00:31:50,378 --> 00:31:52,662
If I were bound and gagged

450
00:31:52,782 --> 00:31:54,519
I couldn't scream,
so all we have to do...

451
00:32:01,564 --> 00:32:03,920
- No!
- There's no other way!

452
00:32:05,113 --> 00:32:07,357
<i>- There's always another way.
- Shields!</i>

453
00:32:07,561 --> 00:32:10,544
This is just putting off the inevitable.

454
00:32:10,664 --> 00:32:13,784
- You're not going back to him.
- I can do more good in the castle.

455
00:32:13,904 --> 00:32:17,061
Marian, I would rather die
here than have you go back...

456
00:32:18,691 --> 00:32:19,955
If you die now,
my father died for nothing.

457
00:32:20,837 --> 00:32:23,357
Trust me,

458
00:32:23,477 --> 00:32:25,037
- I'll get us out of this.
- No, you won't!

459
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,338
Not without my help.

460
00:32:28,165 --> 00:32:29,454
Look, we're in this together.

461
00:32:30,621 --> 00:32:34,507
Now, tie me up.

462
00:32:34,777 --> 00:32:36,507
Right, listen to me. He's only
got two choices now. Run or burn.

463
00:32:36,696 --> 00:32:40,190
Either way he's finished.

464
00:32:41,295 --> 00:32:43,123
And any bird that leaves
those leaves dies in the sky.

465
00:32:43,668 --> 00:32:47,080
There are too many of them.

466
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,465
- What are we going to do?
- After "three" open the shield wall.

467
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,760
One.

468
00:32:57,658 --> 00:32:58,665
Two.

469
00:33:13,774 --> 00:33:14,865
Three!

470
00:33:15,473 --> 00:33:16,540
Gisborne!

471
00:33:16,927 --> 00:33:18,165
If I die,

472
00:33:18,481 --> 00:33:21,363
Marian dies!

473
00:33:26,095 --> 00:33:27,119
No!

474
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:30,000
No! Move! Marian!

475
00:33:30,564 --> 00:33:32,649
So it's true.

476
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:36,127
You still love her.

477
00:33:37,213 --> 00:33:40,770
I've found your weakness, Gisborne.

478
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:43,080
If you harm a single hair on her head,
I swear I will kill you!

479
00:33:43,446 --> 00:33:46,720
You'll die more slowly and painfully
than any man has ever died before!

480
00:33:47,198 --> 00:33:49,611
- Well, I thought that was the point!
- No.

481
00:33:52,628 --> 00:33:54,065
- It would have been quick and painless.
- You let me go,

482
00:33:58,052 --> 00:34:00,812
I'll leave her behind. Untouched.

483
00:34:02,432 --> 00:34:05,126
I'll think about it.

484
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,281
Everybody back! Move!

485
00:34:08,593 --> 00:34:11,107
Well... that bought us some time.

486
00:34:11,227 --> 00:34:12,439
Any ideas?

487
00:34:13,647 --> 00:34:15,079
We need to make
Robin and Marian disappear.

488
00:34:16,784 --> 00:34:17,829
how do we do that?

489
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,106
A puff of smoke.

490
00:34:21,288 --> 00:34:22,925
Be careful.

491
00:34:23,268 --> 00:34:25,357
Are you all right?

492
00:34:25,477 --> 00:34:28,879
I won't leave you behind.

493
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:30,645
But we can make him think that I will.

494
00:34:30,765 --> 00:34:33,228
So now we can all see the famous
Robin Hood for who he really is.

495
00:34:33,537 --> 00:34:37,018
A common coward

496
00:34:37,801 --> 00:34:41,068
using an innocent woman as a hostage.

497
00:34:43,677 --> 00:34:44,937
She's not an innocent,
she's one of you lot!

498
00:34:45,161 --> 00:34:48,719
A pampered parasite
living off the backs of the poor.

499
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,399
Nothing personal.

500
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:54,140
You can't hide behind her skirts
for ever. Come and fight like a man.

501
00:34:56,134 --> 00:34:57,946
Remove your soldiers, Gisborne!

502
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:01,620
Or she dies at sundown!

503
00:35:02,993 --> 00:35:04,860
He wouldn't do that, would he?

504
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,772
He's bluffing. This is a siege.
All I have to do is wait.

505
00:35:14,664 --> 00:35:15,664
Well, you can't wait too long, though.

506
00:35:17,028 --> 00:35:18,090
As soon as the Sheriff
gets back, she's gonna die.

507
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,560
Ready?

508
00:35:49,835 --> 00:35:53,080
Let's go.

509
00:35:53,203 --> 00:35:55,600
The forest's on fire.

510
00:35:55,908 --> 00:35:57,479
It's a smoke screen.
You, you and you! Find the fire!

511
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:58,700
Put it out!
His men are in the forest.

512
00:35:59,846 --> 00:36:02,919
Surround the tree.

513
00:36:04,241 --> 00:36:06,458
Move!

514
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,403
Make sure you see the man on
either side of you at all times.

515
00:36:15,523 --> 00:36:17,559
Right, close in the circle, move in!

516
00:36:18,483 --> 00:36:20,959
Yes!

517
00:36:24,874 --> 00:36:26,180
I know what you're doing, Hood,
and it won't work.

518
00:36:27,161 --> 00:36:28,359
<i>We're ready for you. Ready and waiting.</i>

519
00:36:29,462 --> 00:36:30,654
It's from Will.

520
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:40,440
He's got a plan.

521
00:36:44,613 --> 00:36:46,756
Here. Here.

522
00:36:46,876 --> 00:36:50,520
Good. Horses.

523
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,553
You'll have to put your arms around me.

524
00:36:54,808 --> 00:36:57,359
- No, I'm not coming.
- Marian, we haven't got time for this!

525
00:37:00,088 --> 00:37:02,550
- Then go, before they see the rope.
- We can both go now.

526
00:37:03,437 --> 00:37:06,049
I'm staying here
until you get away safely.

527
00:37:06,366 --> 00:37:10,349
- This is about Gisborne, isn't it?
- No.

528
00:37:10,808 --> 00:37:13,970
Inside us, we both know
we belong together.

529
00:37:16,572 --> 00:37:17,680
And being apart will tear me apart
but I'm more use in the castle.

530
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:23,261
I can protect you better from there.
It's our only hope.

531
00:37:23,526 --> 00:37:26,704
Trust me.

532
00:37:35,501 --> 00:37:37,085
Give me your hand.

533
00:37:44,881 --> 00:37:47,281
- No. Just give me your hand.
- Is this a trick?

534
00:37:47,605 --> 00:37:50,360
It's an engagement ring.

535
00:37:50,521 --> 00:37:54,224
- This afternoon we had a plan.
- Yes,

536
00:37:55,355 --> 00:37:58,963
find Lardner
and bring the King home.

537
00:37:59,689 --> 00:38:01,387
Defeat the Sheriff and get
married, in that order, Robin.

538
00:38:04,969 --> 00:38:07,386
First things first.
This isn't what I want to do.

539
00:38:35,364 --> 00:38:38,380
It's what I have to do.

540
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,999
- I love you.
- I love you too.

541
00:38:40,161 --> 00:38:41,189
- Let's just get out of here.
- Has Will got everything?

542
00:38:41,556 --> 00:38:43,237
Help!

543
00:38:43,357 --> 00:38:44,999
Somebody please help me!

544
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:47,372
- Robin's gone.
- Get after him.

545
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:50,380
Do not let him release that bird.

546
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:52,840
£50 to the man who kills the pigeon.

547
00:38:53,106 --> 00:38:54,493
He's left me up here
to die, help me!

548
00:38:55,732 --> 00:38:57,920
Marian, I'm coming!

549
00:38:58,245 --> 00:38:59,323
- Is the note ready?
- Yeah. Where's Marian?

550
00:38:59,582 --> 00:39:01,966
She's fine.

551
00:39:02,086 --> 00:39:04,241
Just get out of here
and don't let that bird go

552
00:39:13,153 --> 00:39:14,949
until you're out of range, all right?

553
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:21,580
I'm coming! Marian...

554
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:23,967
Nearly there. Marian, hold on!

555
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:33,060
Hurry up!

556
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,579
It's all right, I've got you.
I've got you.

557
00:39:41,086 --> 00:39:42,441
You're coming home with me.

558
00:39:49,332 --> 00:39:50,580
You're safe now.

559
00:39:50,811 --> 00:39:51,905
Release the bird!

560
00:40:20,373 --> 00:40:21,374
Release it!

561
00:40:35,149 --> 00:40:36,276
Come on!

562
00:41:14,904 --> 00:41:17,040
And fetch...

563
00:41:17,201 --> 00:41:18,599
- Cheer up.
- What have I got to be cheery about?

564
00:41:20,184 --> 00:41:22,320
Well, we've got a visitor.

565
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,163
- Who are you?
- Not him.

566
00:41:24,921 --> 00:41:26,847
Him!

567
00:41:28,517 --> 00:41:29,519
It's Lardner. Say hello.

568
00:41:31,129 --> 00:41:33,257
You're joking?

569
00:41:33,377 --> 00:41:35,960
When you want something
to disappear, the trick

570
00:41:36,121 --> 00:41:39,018
- is to divert the audience attention.
- He switched the birds.

571
00:41:39,902 --> 00:41:42,286
I just happened to have
a spare stuck up my sleeve.

572
00:41:42,406 --> 00:41:44,040
Should've attached a verse
of the note to the decoy bird.

573
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:48,171
Nah. Would've just weighed him down.

574
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:50,080
Yes, speaking of decoy birds,

575
00:41:51,029 --> 00:41:52,466
is Marian all right with Gisborne?

576
00:41:53,264 --> 00:41:54,962
Yeah, she'll be fine.

577
00:41:57,617 --> 00:42:00,376
She can look after herself.

578
00:42:01,281 --> 00:42:03,152
Well, hey.
Do you want to do the honours?

579
00:42:03,697 --> 00:42:06,023
At least we have some hope now.

580
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:09,928
Yeah. Thanks to Lardner.

581
00:42:10,575 --> 00:42:12,060
Good luck, my friend.

582
00:42:31,761 --> 00:42:33,583
Safe journey home.

583
00:42:33,703 --> 00:42:35,960
The Sheriff's missing. Find him.

584
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,200
Nottingham is about to be flattened.

585
00:42:40,609 --> 00:42:41,960
I don't think Robin is the
problem. He might be the solution.

586
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:45,639
<i>- Ask.
- Nooooo!</i>

587
00:42:45,859 --> 00:42:48,359
Marry me now.
And make it the last thing we do.

588
00:42:48,521 --> 00:42:50,814
- Who are you?
- I am the man with the plan.

589
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,711
- The Sheriff is heading for the camp.
- It's time...

590
00:42:54,361 --> 00:42:56,279
They're coming, they're coming!!

591
00:42:54,361 --> 00:42:56,279
Get those gates open!
