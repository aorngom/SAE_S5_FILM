1
00:00:00,558 --> 00:00:03,473
Dominus tecum
Benedicta tu...

2
00:00:05,247 --> 00:00:08,106
Are the men ready to cause
chaos in Clun? Yes, my lord.

3
00:00:09,043 --> 00:00:10,408
This scheme sounds elaborate.

4
00:00:10,982 --> 00:00:15,341
Stop whining, Gisborne. If I'd wanted a wife,
I would have found one with better legs.

5
00:00:16,167 --> 00:00:17,932
Trust me, Carter is a godsend.

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,344
Shoulders back.
He kills people for fun.

7
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:22,605
Then why are we paying him?

8
00:00:24,612 --> 00:00:27,312
Fun... and money.

9
00:00:45,903 --> 00:00:47,025
Look at the hands!

10
00:00:56,758 --> 00:00:59,690
Ah, morning, Carter.
This is Gisborne.

11
00:01:03,242 --> 00:01:04,245
My Lord Sheriff.

12
00:01:07,088 --> 00:01:09,267
Respect, Gisborne, hm? I like it.

13
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:12,775
Why don't you ever
kiss my ring, hm?

14
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,656
So... you know what
you're going to do?

15
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:18,791
Retrieve the Great Pact of Nottingham
and kill Robin Hood.

16
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:22,169
Believe me, my lord, nothing
would give me greater pleasure.

17
00:01:23,294 --> 00:01:25,150
Robin Hood is as good as dead.

18
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,864
PEOPLE SCREAM, HORSES WHINNY

19
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,763
Robin! Sheriff's men.

20
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,978
Wait! You don't want them to see
you with outlaws. I don't care!

21
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:28,638
They're attacking the village. Let's
get them. Why are they doing this?

22
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,349
"Why"?! Robin,
there isn't time for "why"!

23
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:34,584
Let's go. Marian, we'll wait
and see how many... Come on!

24
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:36,288
Marian!

25
00:02:38,287 --> 00:02:39,335
There's too many of them!

26
00:02:53,928 --> 00:02:56,945
Marian! Move!

27
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,635
You, stay there! Don't move!

28
00:03:10,585 --> 00:03:11,629
SWORD IS UNSHEATHED

29
00:03:22,007 --> 00:03:23,083
Who's that?!

30
00:03:23,748 --> 00:03:24,884
Robin! The gallows!

31
00:03:36,532 --> 00:03:37,437
Friend, behind you!

32
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,475
DJAQ: The Sheriff's men
are running away.

33
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:01,802
Oh, my Lord! Oh, you've saved us!

34
00:04:02,146 --> 00:04:05,162
He's good. He's very good.

35
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,932
Don't ever tie me up! Well, you didn't
listen to your orders. People were dying.

36
00:04:26,429 --> 00:04:27,959
Marian, you can't be seen with us.
Why not?!

37
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,866
Robin, I AM with you. Because if
the Sheriff finds out, or Gisborne,

38
00:04:32,866 --> 00:04:35,646
then you can never go back to the
castle. I don't want to go back.

39
00:04:36,524 --> 00:04:39,868
Well, I'm glad. But you're not ready
to make that decision.

40
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:46,950
Thank you, my friend.

41
00:04:47,985 --> 00:04:48,998
I owe you my life.

42
00:04:50,805 --> 00:04:51,527
Yes, you do.

43
00:04:52,343 --> 00:04:55,337
But I won't take it just yet. Carter.

44
00:04:56,651 --> 00:04:59,509
Robin Hood. Much.

45
00:04:59,931 --> 00:05:01,782
Nice, er... move.

46
00:05:03,172 --> 00:05:04,683
Do I know you? I...

47
00:05:05,871 --> 00:05:10,840
We've never met. These soldiers, why are
they attacking innocent people? He's wounded!

48
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,450
It's nothing. Whoa!

49
00:05:13,784 --> 00:05:16,844
Djaq! Come on. Get up.

50
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:18,936
Let's get him out of here. Come on.

51
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,482
John! John! Will, get the quiver.

52
00:05:25,235 --> 00:05:27,858
I'm sure I've met him.
(Much, let it be!) I'm sure.

53
00:05:29,331 --> 00:05:30,154
I know that face.

54
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:36,534
Did you fight in the Holy Land?
Yes. But we didn't meet.

55
00:05:38,373 --> 00:05:41,031
How can you be sure?
YOU, I'd have remembered.

56
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:44,216
Why have you come back?

57
00:05:45,436 --> 00:05:46,334
Stabbed in the back.

58
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:49,684
Did you get him? The one who did it?

59
00:05:51,248 --> 00:05:53,840
No... but I've been biding my time.

60
00:05:54,683 --> 00:05:57,223
Preparing.
You looked prepared today.

61
00:05:57,921 --> 00:05:59,367
You could have taken on
a whole army of them.

62
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:03,278
Must be disappointed, though,
with, er... today's wound.

63
00:06:04,204 --> 00:06:06,731
I mean, if you're planning to go
back to the Holy Land and kill him.

64
00:06:08,103 --> 00:06:10,541
He's here. In England?

65
00:06:12,933 --> 00:06:15,214
It wasn't me, was it?
CARTER LAUGHS

66
00:06:16,774 --> 00:06:17,822
It worked, it worked!

67
00:06:18,715 --> 00:06:21,815
Hood saw the poor, innocent people
of Clun being attacked.

68
00:06:22,045 --> 00:06:24,742
And then dashed, rather dashingly,
in to save them.

69
00:06:25,366 --> 00:06:26,455
And we lost several guards.

70
00:06:27,264 --> 00:06:29,825
Yes, yes, yes.
It's very unfortunate. Um...

71
00:06:30,158 --> 00:06:32,421
Send their families
a basket of fruit. Small.

72
00:06:33,404 --> 00:06:37,579
But it worked! Carter left with
Hood. Hood could already be dead!

73
00:06:39,581 --> 00:06:42,111
Oh, and by the way,
Marian sent a message.

74
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,410
What message? Oh, um...

75
00:06:47,704 --> 00:06:49,501
"I'm not coming back, get over it,

76
00:06:50,308 --> 00:06:52,901
"and for God's sake, change
your clothes once in a while!"

77
00:06:53,853 --> 00:06:56,780
Very funny(!)
She ran away.

78
00:06:57,901 --> 00:06:58,853
Guy, sit down.

79
00:07:04,712 --> 00:07:09,420
She ran away the minute
her dad died. Hm?

80
00:07:10,634 --> 00:07:12,866
Now, what does that tell us?
It tells me...

81
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:19,197
that the crusty one was
the only thing keeping her here.

82
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,125
No. There was something between us.

83
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:29,292
No. She's not coming back, Guy.
Move on.

84
00:07:31,222 --> 00:07:32,615
GUY SIGHS
I'll tell you what...

85
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:36,132
...I'll give you a kiss, hm?
That'll make you feel better.

86
00:07:37,535 --> 00:07:40,821
Oh, come along. In fact, if Hood's
dead, I'll give you TWO kisses!

87
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:42,740
Come along. Kissy, kiss, kissy!

88
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,990
Get off me!

89
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:49,964
Grow up, Gisborne.

90
00:08:03,423 --> 00:08:07,025
Are you going to apologise to me?
You could have got me killed.

91
00:08:07,676 --> 00:08:10,232
I think you would have got
yourself killed without my help.

92
00:08:11,188 --> 00:08:16,016
Charging in like that. Robin, I've been fighting
these idiots for years, as the Nightwatchman.

93
00:08:17,261 --> 00:08:19,480
Remember? I know. On your own.

94
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:24,005
This is a team, Marian. You went
crashing in and we all had to follow.

95
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:27,015
And in battle, that's a cardinal
sin. We work together. MARION SCOFFS

96
00:08:28,303 --> 00:08:32,015
You mean they do as you tell them?
Yeah! Yeah, they do.

97
00:08:33,157 --> 00:08:36,390
Until you learn to do the same, you
can stay here at the camp. What?!

98
00:08:36,971 --> 00:08:40,174
I mean it, Marian.
You need to calm down.

99
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,954
(Look, I don't need
to be mollycoddled, all right?)

100
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,054
Good! Because you're
not going to get it here!

101
00:08:54,973 --> 00:08:55,977
ROBIN GROANS

102
00:09:09,053 --> 00:09:10,679
Have you been sent to baby-sit me?

103
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:18,159
Why do you do everything he says?

104
00:09:19,756 --> 00:09:21,724
I thought you used to have
your own men, Little John.

105
00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:25,213
I did.
But there can only be one leader.

106
00:09:27,542 --> 00:09:32,964
This is not how I thought
it would be... living in the forest.

107
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:39,086
I can't breathe... in here.

108
00:09:39,817 --> 00:09:41,285
It's worse than living
in the castle.

109
00:09:43,976 --> 00:09:44,773
Come here.

110
00:09:58,341 --> 00:09:59,921
It's not the here or there, is it?

111
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,733
It's your father.
You've lost your father.

112
00:10:07,722 --> 00:10:11,504
And that's why
I want to get on with things.

113
00:10:12,393 --> 00:10:15,080
In time. In time.

114
00:10:36,813 --> 00:10:37,702
You should be resting.

115
00:10:38,784 --> 00:10:41,359
Things to do. What things?

116
00:10:57,868 --> 00:11:01,332
MUFFLED SCREAM
Stay here.

117
00:11:01,332 --> 00:11:03,297
Stay here. I will.

118
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:33,921
Let me guess...

119
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:38,030
the Sheriff sent you.
He wants his Pact back.

120
00:12:39,328 --> 00:12:40,423
No chance.

121
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,986
I guaranteed it. Yeah?

122
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:45,067
Well, you made a mistake.

123
00:12:45,976 --> 00:12:48,506
Tell me where you've hidden it.
I'll die first.

124
00:12:49,547 --> 00:12:53,344
No... your friends will die first,
one by one, until you tell me.

125
00:12:55,687 --> 00:12:57,764
See, that little look back...

126
00:12:59,735 --> 00:13:00,813
you just revealed your weakness.

127
00:13:02,878 --> 00:13:05,704
Never look back, friend.
Now I know I've won.

128
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:11,767
So... who shall we start with?

129
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:13,734
Your little sidekick
in the Holy Land?

130
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,221
Or do you have a soft spot
for the girl?

131
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,703
I thought so!

132
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,282
Unbelievable!

133
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:37,848
We took him in!
We pitied him because he was wounded

134
00:13:38,344 --> 00:13:40,943
I think that was his plan, Much.
I know.

135
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:45,303
I knew. Just... outrageous!

136
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:54,939
Marian...
He'll tell us more if he knows we're happy tu hurt him. Won't he?

137
00:13:55,213 --> 00:13:57,743
That's not how we're doing this.
Speak for yourself.

138
00:13:59,192 --> 00:14:03,473
Just go and cook something. What, because
I'm a woman? No, because I'm hungry!

139
00:14:09,186 --> 00:14:10,296
What are we going to do with him, Robin?

140
00:14:12,091 --> 00:14:13,197
We'll take him back to Nottingham.

141
00:14:14,844 --> 00:14:17,526
He's failed to find the Pact
and he's failed to kill me.

142
00:14:18,715 --> 00:14:21,210
So, What do you think the Sheriff would do to
a man who's failed him that badly?

143
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,483
Hang him by the neck.
ROBIN LAUGHS

144
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:25,744
If he's lucky.

145
00:14:27,822 --> 00:14:28,586
Come on.

146
00:14:34,943 --> 00:14:35,428
Wake up!

147
00:14:38,723 --> 00:14:40,289
What do you want? I want Marian.

148
00:14:42,054 --> 00:14:44,506
Do you know where she is?
What do you think?

149
00:14:46,447 --> 00:14:48,680
How am I supposed to find her, then?
She could be anywhere.

150
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,591
Ask around.

151
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:54,266
Earn your keep.

152
00:14:58,043 --> 00:14:59,779
Nottingham, then? No.

153
00:15:01,038 --> 00:15:01,629
Clun first.

154
00:15:03,787 --> 00:15:06,209
Not you, Marian.
You're staying here. Why?

155
00:15:07,097 --> 00:15:10,896
Because... I think you need
some time alone. Why?

156
00:15:11,946 --> 00:15:13,581
Because this isn't the Marian
I know and love.

157
00:15:14,325 --> 00:15:16,804
I'm sorry if you're disappointed,
but this is who I am now. Really?

158
00:15:17,864 --> 00:15:20,851
Well, I hope not. Come on, let's go.

159
00:15:22,236 --> 00:15:26,897
Why Clun? Because there's something
I want him to see. Come on!

160
00:15:43,678 --> 00:15:44,630
I'm sorry, Jane.

161
00:15:45,738 --> 00:15:49,303
We'll make sure you and your
family eat. You have my word.

162
00:15:50,151 --> 00:15:51,341
Thank you, Robin.

163
00:15:51,927 --> 00:15:54,051
Don't worry, Jane.
We'll set you straight. Here.

164
00:15:58,038 --> 00:15:58,996
Come on.

165
00:16:01,318 --> 00:16:03,006
Her husband died because of you.

166
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:05,980
I only killed Sheriff's men.

167
00:16:07,505 --> 00:16:09,677
And they only killed villagers
to make you look good.

168
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:12,804
Now, was that the Sheriff's idea
or was it yours?

169
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,754
His. His. But you were happy
to go along with it.

170
00:16:17,903 --> 00:16:21,412
And you were happy to see her husband die,
if it meant that you'd get closer to me.

171
00:16:22,164 --> 00:16:25,566
What's your point, Locksley?
My point, assassin...

172
00:16:28,301 --> 00:16:31,799
...is there's widows here today, all trying
to comfort children who don't understand

173
00:16:32,004 --> 00:16:35,377
why their father didn't come home, and
why their mother won't stop crying.

174
00:16:36,506 --> 00:16:38,904
If you want me to feel sorry,
you're wasting your time. Am I?

175
00:16:40,308 --> 00:16:42,956
Because there's a reason why you
don't like to look back, Carter.

176
00:16:44,788 --> 00:16:46,644
Because you don't want
to see what it is you do.

177
00:16:48,145 --> 00:16:51,900
Because you don't like what you do.
And d'you know how I know that?

178
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,277
It's because I used to be like you.

179
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,916
I've killed
in the Holy Land as well.

180
00:16:59,788 --> 00:17:01,878
Boo-hoo(!) Boo-hoo...

181
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:24,101
You could have had my eye out!

182
00:17:24,727 --> 00:17:27,139
You've got some nerve,
showing your face in the forest.

183
00:17:28,717 --> 00:17:32,991
I checked you were on your own first. I know what
the lads'll do to me if they get half a chance,

184
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:36,898
but I figured I owe you this much. You're
here for me? Gisborne wants me to find you.

185
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:41,306
I mean, obviously I didn't tell him
you'd probably be here. Obviously.

186
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,995
No, but I'm going to need to tell him
something, right? So I was thinking,

187
00:17:45,678 --> 00:17:49,771
I could tell you've joined the Sisters of the Immaculate
Conception, Ripley convent.
Would he believe that? Yeah.

188
00:17:50,318 --> 00:17:54,879
Yeah. I was thinking, you could write a note.
Just say you want to be left alone.

189
00:17:55,495 --> 00:17:57,332
A bit of praying, grieving
or whatever.

190
00:17:58,103 --> 00:18:01,239
Why would YOU help ME?
Look, I'm not all bad.

191
00:18:02,417 --> 00:18:05,686
And any letters from the convent have
to be sealed by the mother superior.

192
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,373
I can sort that. How?

193
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:10,637
I'm good with nuns.

194
00:18:11,295 --> 00:18:12,967
Ave Maria, gratia plena

195
00:18:13,655 --> 00:18:16,343
Dominus tecum
Benedicta tu...

196
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:21,848
Shhhh! You're all right.
I'm not going to hurt you.

197
00:18:22,813 --> 00:18:24,911
I just want to borrow your ring.
MUFFLED SHOUTS

198
00:18:24,748 --> 00:18:26,228
Here we are. Come here.

199
00:18:27,994 --> 00:18:31,041
Lovely. Here you are.

200
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:34,336
Buy yourself a new habit.
Say a little prayer for me.

201
00:18:39,729 --> 00:18:41,305
Right, Will, let's go.

202
00:18:44,571 --> 00:18:45,524
PUNCH LANDS
Ah!

203
00:18:45,282 --> 00:18:49,935
HE GROANS
Are you all right? Yeah.

204
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,225
Everyone to me! Where did he go?

205
00:18:54,454 --> 00:18:56,300
Where is he?
John, Will, check by the road.

206
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,408
You two, down there. Now!

207
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:03,435
What about you? I'll stay here.

208
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:07,436
Go on, go. You would need two!

209
00:20:05,643 --> 00:20:07,502
I accepted a contract to kill you.

210
00:20:08,753 --> 00:20:10,136
I will fulfil that contract.

211
00:20:12,393 --> 00:20:16,472
It's not just a contract...
is it, Carter?

212
00:20:19,096 --> 00:20:22,666
Much was right, wasn't he?
We did meet in the Holy Land.

213
00:20:23,565 --> 00:20:26,269
You never met me. You met my brother.

214
00:20:27,783 --> 00:20:29,957
What was his name?
You don't remember?!

215
00:20:30,661 --> 00:20:32,800
You should. You killed him.

216
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,645
ROBIN LAUGHS
What was his name?

217
00:20:37,145 --> 00:20:39,079
Thomas. "Thomas"?

218
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,518
And, yes, this is for him.

219
00:20:43,844 --> 00:20:44,841
I've waited for this moment.

220
00:20:45,902 --> 00:20:48,261
I've imagined it so many
different ways. Meeting you.

221
00:20:48,935 --> 00:20:50,662
Killing you. Good.

222
00:20:51,622 --> 00:20:53,247
Well, I hope
it lives up to expectation.

223
00:20:53,468 --> 00:20:55,013
It will. I've trained myself.

224
00:20:56,796 --> 00:20:58,984
I'm the best there is
and I exist, Locksley, to kill you.

225
00:21:04,628 --> 00:21:05,862
I didn't kill him, Carter.

226
00:21:08,262 --> 00:21:09,603
You ordered him into a village.

227
00:21:11,385 --> 00:21:12,853
He called for help,
but you did not come.

228
00:21:13,918 --> 00:21:17,214
You let him die. I remember him.

229
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,276
He was a good fighter.
He was a war hero.

230
00:21:20,603 --> 00:21:24,339
Yeah. And he stopped listening.
He thought he was invincible.

231
00:21:24,643 --> 00:21:28,509
He led the charge into that village. We told
him it was dangerous. He wouldn't listen.

232
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:31,671
No. We tried to save him.

233
00:21:32,563 --> 00:21:38,922
I tried. You're lying. I was there when they brought
back his body. The stretcher bearers told me everything.

234
00:21:41,951 --> 00:21:46,251
I told them to make up the story, so his
family would remember him as a war hero,

235
00:21:47,028 --> 00:21:48,733
not as a fool
who got himself killed.

236
00:21:50,968 --> 00:21:51,658
Rubbish!

237
00:21:54,589 --> 00:21:59,806
He wasn't the only one who died that day. Morgan
Foster died trying to save him. Matthew Kent.

238
00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:02,823
You think I believe this?
You're just frightened to die.

239
00:22:03,303 --> 00:22:07,007
You were a coward then, and you still
are. He cried when he died. Liar!

240
00:22:07,504 --> 00:22:11,346
He cried! And he said "Tell my family I didn't cry"

241
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:16,064
"Tell them I wasn't crying. I was
laughing on the wrong side of my face!"

242
00:22:16,816 --> 00:22:21,347
That's what he used to say
- "Laughing on the wrong side of your face." How do you know that?

243
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,564
I know, because I held him
in my arms when he died.

244
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:33,188
No. He was a hero.

245
00:22:34,246 --> 00:22:36,681
You killed him. You're lying.

246
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,757
If you really think I'm lying,

247
00:22:39,587 --> 00:22:43,556
you can kill me.
If you think it'll give you peace...

248
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,321
...then kill me now.

249
00:23:08,594 --> 00:23:09,782
He WAS a hero.

250
00:23:12,063 --> 00:23:13,750
Just not on that day.

251
00:23:19,045 --> 00:23:20,288
What am I doing here?

252
00:23:23,108 --> 00:23:24,270
I don't know what I'm doing.

253
00:23:31,773 --> 00:23:32,439
Help me.

254
00:23:34,703 --> 00:23:35,426
My brother...

255
00:23:38,693 --> 00:23:39,836
...I loved him so much.

256
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,301
It's all right.

257
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:57,535
Hey... come on.

258
00:24:00,782 --> 00:24:01,710
It's all right.

259
00:24:04,658 --> 00:24:05,646
It's all right.

260
00:24:11,472 --> 00:24:12,437
Are you all right?

261
00:24:14,813 --> 00:24:17,379
CARTER SOBS
Why is he crying?

262
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,033
He's not crying.

263
00:24:22,553 --> 00:24:24,688
He's laughing
on the wrong side of his face.

264
00:24:29,405 --> 00:24:30,812
Well, now you know
she's safe and well.

265
00:24:34,379 --> 00:24:36,640
And how do you know
that she's safe and well?

266
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:40,469
She said. Did she?

267
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:44,539
I thought they took
a vow of silence.

268
00:24:45,616 --> 00:24:46,668
No, I mean, the, um...

269
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:50,585
the mother superior said,
when she gave me the letter. No.

270
00:24:53,144 --> 00:24:56,249
No. This is not right.

271
00:24:56,457 --> 00:24:57,207
What do you mean?

272
00:24:59,126 --> 00:25:03,641
Marian cannot take holy orders.
She has a life to lead.

273
00:25:05,896 --> 00:25:08,250
Saddle my horse.
Oh, I don't really do saddling.

274
00:25:09,361 --> 00:25:10,850
Do as you're told! Sure.

275
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,289
Where are we going, then?
Ripley convent. Yeah?

276
00:25:15,425 --> 00:25:17,397
Hang on! Doesn't she want
to be on her own, grieving and...?

277
00:25:18,861 --> 00:25:20,713
Get my horse!
All right! All right.

278
00:25:23,437 --> 00:25:24,628
Thomas was my hero.

279
00:25:26,065 --> 00:25:27,704
Whatever he did, I had to do, too.

280
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:30,241
And when he joined
the Knights Templar,

281
00:25:31,457 --> 00:25:32,425
I knew I had to follow.

282
00:25:33,969 --> 00:25:36,720
I had only just joined when...
when he died.

283
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:39,878
Thomas... You look like him.

284
00:25:40,801 --> 00:25:42,049
That's why I recognised you.

285
00:25:43,149 --> 00:25:44,603
I was determined to carry on for him.

286
00:25:45,459 --> 00:25:48,189
To be as good as him.
To get to the very top.

287
00:25:49,356 --> 00:25:52,073
I joined the King's private Guard
Like us!

288
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,128
And that's where I heard about you.

289
00:25:55,111 --> 00:25:58,684
Robin this, Robin that...
How great you were.

290
00:26:00,097 --> 00:26:02,517
And it made my blood boil.

291
00:26:03,941 --> 00:26:06,755
And every time I killed,
I imagined I was killing you -

292
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:11,075
the man who took my brother
away from me. And when I returned...

293
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,013
I came straight to Nottingham, where the
Sheriff has a contract on your head. £500.

294
00:26:17,764 --> 00:26:20,610
£500?! So I figured...

295
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:25,595
with his plan to lure you to the
village, I'd get to you quicker.

296
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,278
So all this death
was for personal revenge?!

297
00:26:35,223 --> 00:26:37,513
When did you last see the King? Why?

298
00:26:38,365 --> 00:26:40,989
Well, because...
we sent him a message -

299
00:26:42,402 --> 00:26:43,859
a very important message.

300
00:26:45,046 --> 00:26:48,484
The messenger was a man called Roger
of Stoke. Do you know him? I know Roger.

301
00:26:49,264 --> 00:26:52,548
No. He was expected, but did not return.
MUCH GASPS

302
00:26:53,627 --> 00:26:54,701
Great(!)

303
00:26:56,550 --> 00:27:00,268
So the King knows nothing about Shah
Mat? Shah-what? That doesn't concern you.

304
00:27:02,952 --> 00:27:06,421
What can I do? What can you do...?

305
00:27:09,489 --> 00:27:11,254
You can do what you set out to do.

306
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:15,046
Go back to Nottingham,
give the Sheriff back his Pact...

307
00:27:15,878 --> 00:27:18,718
and one dead outlaw.

308
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:22,686
MUCH: I can't believe
we're trusting him.

309
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:27,656
He just tried to kill us. Of all of us,
you and I know what war can do to a man.

310
00:27:28,903 --> 00:27:31,403
I've been to war, but I
didn't come back a mad killer.

311
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:35,904
Well, the demons work in different
ways, don't they? MUCH SIGHS

312
00:27:36,403 --> 00:27:41,173
But they're the same demons. I've got my demons
and you've never held me like you held him.

313
00:27:41,623 --> 00:27:43,238
Much! You haven't.

314
00:27:44,607 --> 00:27:48,030
You've never listened to MY story.
That's because I was there with you.

315
00:27:49,164 --> 00:27:52,168
It's my story, too. Yeah, I know.

316
00:27:53,727 --> 00:27:55,368
It's just
we've never talked about it.

317
00:27:56,678 --> 00:27:58,741
You know, we never talk.
Well, all right,

318
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:04,837
let's talk. No. Not if you're doing
it to humour me. No. Come on, Much!

319
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,430
Whatever I say you never listen to me, anyway.
Well, you know that's not true.

320
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:12,175
I told you I recognised Carter
from the Crusades.

321
00:28:12,851 --> 00:28:14,629
ROBIN SIGHS
But you didn't believe me.

322
00:28:15,415 --> 00:28:18,627
You'd listen to Marian...
spend time with her.

323
00:28:18,627 --> 00:28:20,790
Much... stop.

324
00:28:23,414 --> 00:28:24,290
All right?

325
00:28:29,631 --> 00:28:30,778
Old friend...

326
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:36,260
you have a special place
in my heart. Do I?

327
00:28:39,271 --> 00:28:40,903
Well, do I really have to say it?

328
00:28:43,302 --> 00:28:45,243
No. Of course not.

329
00:28:53,037 --> 00:28:54,680
Just once in a while,
it would be nice.

330
00:28:58,835 --> 00:29:02,131
What's he doing here?
Don't worry. It's a long story.

331
00:29:04,296 --> 00:29:05,894
Allan was here. Allan?!

332
00:29:06,501 --> 00:29:08,311
Yeah. Gisborne sent him to find me.

333
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,944
I'll kill him! No, he was trying
to help. LITTLE JOHN SCOFFS

00:29:12,218 --> 00:29:15,816
He sent Gisborne a letter
saying I'm at Ripley convent.

335
00:29:16,984 --> 00:29:18,584
The medicine's ready
whenever you want.

336
00:29:20,905 --> 00:29:22,304
This could be dangerous, Robin.

337
00:29:23,736 --> 00:29:27,343
What is it you say, John?
"Today's a good day to die!"

338
00:29:28,281 --> 00:29:31,533
What? We're going to Nottingham
to collect Carter's fee.

339
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,523
We're going to give it
to the people of Clun.

340
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,594
"We"? I take it that includes me?

341
00:29:38,192 --> 00:29:41,781
I'm sorry, Marian. Either I'm
part of your gang or I'm not.

342
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:46,459
Marian, for today,
please just stay here.

343
00:29:47,142 --> 00:29:48,302
Very well.

344
00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:52,160
Excuse me? I said, "very well".

345
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:56,103
I bow to your authority. Thank you.

346
00:29:59,491 --> 00:30:02,396
I'm ready. Do we really need him?

347
00:30:03,172 --> 00:30:06,961
Well, the Sheriff's not going to give the money
to anybody else now, is he? And if he betrays us?

348
00:30:07,578 --> 00:30:10,411
Then on my head be it.
If he does, blame me.

349
00:30:10,922 --> 00:30:13,738
Good. I will... when we're dead.

350
00:30:13,954 --> 00:30:18,165
Good. And that's a rule
I'd like you to stick to -

351
00:30:18,785 --> 00:30:21,986
don't kill anybody unless
you have to. Spoilsport!

352
00:30:23,187 --> 00:30:26,410
Djaq... do your worst.

353
00:30:26,739 --> 00:30:30,346
Today is a good day.
I hate sayings.

354
00:30:36,063 --> 00:30:38,909
Creatorem caeli et terrae

355
00:30:42,699 --> 00:30:45,211
Et in lesum Christum

356
00:30:49,352 --> 00:30:51,842
Filium eius unicum

357
00:30:56,212 --> 00:30:58,386
Dominum nostrum

358
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,604
Passus sub Pontio Pilato

359
00:31:08,787 --> 00:31:11,197
Crucifixus...
(What are you doing here?)

360
00:31:11,729 --> 00:31:13,478
(You should be back at camp.)
I lied.

361
00:31:14,594 --> 00:31:17,354
What are you going to do about it?
Nothing.

362
00:32:17,585 --> 00:32:18,338
What's this?

363
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:21,178
Robin Hood. As promised.

364
00:32:22,867 --> 00:32:25,368
Dead? Dead.

365
00:32:27,868 --> 00:32:29,244
Really?

366
00:32:32,745 --> 00:32:34,762
Did you check him? Yes, Sir Guy.

367
00:32:36,827 --> 00:32:38,351
Well, let's make doubly sure,
shall we?

368
00:32:42,244 --> 00:32:43,554
Show me his neck.

369
00:32:54,628 --> 00:32:56,973
Guy! Marian?!

370
00:33:01,163 --> 00:33:02,252
What's happening here?

371
00:33:03,212 --> 00:33:05,484
Robin Hood. He's dead.

372
00:33:06,461 --> 00:33:07,516
Congratulations.

373
00:33:09,094 --> 00:33:10,472
I need to speak with you.

374
00:33:12,881 --> 00:33:14,447
In private, please.

375
00:33:18,222 --> 00:33:19,033
Carry on.

376
00:33:26,955 --> 00:33:29,533
Dei Patris omnipotentis

377
00:33:31,249 --> 00:33:34,068
Sanctam Ecclesiam catholicam...

378
00:33:34,822 --> 00:33:36,870
Yes, yes, that's
quite enough of the gobbledegook.

379
00:33:37,077 --> 00:33:38,216
Anywhere on the table will be fine.

380
00:33:52,465 --> 00:33:53,123
Exeunt.

381
00:33:55,015 --> 00:33:55,870
It means, "get out".

382
00:33:57,888 --> 00:33:59,607
They're with me. Not any more.

383
00:34:01,361 --> 00:34:03,607
Wait for me outside.
I will pay you then.

384
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:19,200
We have... bad days.

385
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:21,854
We have good days.

386
00:34:25,402 --> 00:34:30,637
And... when we have Robin Hood,

387
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:34,794
laid out dead on our table,
we have the best days of our lives!

388
00:34:37,151 --> 00:34:39,058
The, um...
The Great Pact of Nottingham?

389
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,933
Do you know what
I'm going to do with him now?

390
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:48,635
That's not my concern, my lord.
My work here is done.

391
00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:54,363
Yes. Is that a subtle hint
that you'd like to be paid?

392
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:56,842
I believe
I've fulfilled my contract. Oh...

393
00:34:57,814 --> 00:34:59,254
Yes, I believe you have.

394
00:35:01,028 --> 00:35:04,110
We shouldn't have left him. We didn't have
a choice. What if Carter isn't one of us?

395
00:35:04,875 --> 00:35:06,746
What if he tells the Sheriff?
Then Robin's dead.

396
00:35:12,261 --> 00:35:13,439
I received your letter.

397
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:19,046
I was about to come and visit you. I asked to be
left alone, and still you were coming to see me?

398
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,404
You knew I would. Yes.

399
00:35:24,349 --> 00:35:25,367
And that's why I came.

400
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:30,349
To ask you to please leave me be.

401
00:35:32,566 --> 00:35:33,431
Marian...

402
00:35:35,771 --> 00:35:37,927
Do you seriously
expect me to believe

403
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:41,121
that you have given yourself to God?

404
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:46,680
Trust me, I haven't given
myself to anybody. Not yet.

405
00:35:47,816 --> 00:35:49,927
Good, because until you do,

406
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:53,583
I will always believe that
there is a chance for you and me.

407
00:35:54,863 --> 00:35:58,809
I need to think. Stop thinking.
Come home to me!

408
00:35:59,849 --> 00:36:01,526
You burned my home to the ground!

409
00:36:03,139 --> 00:36:03,992
Marian...

410
00:36:06,771 --> 00:36:08,084
...if I could take that back,

411
00:36:09,318 --> 00:36:14,076
if I could show you the side to me that wants
to build a home, not burn it down. I've seen it.

412
00:36:14,508 --> 00:36:18,191
Then why do you reject it?
My father is dead.

413
00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:23,653
I need time... to grieve.

414
00:36:25,572 --> 00:36:27,015
What better way to grieve

415
00:36:28,014 --> 00:36:30,229
than to create new life? Marian!

416
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:33,477
I thought that I might
never see you again.

417
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:36,353
I thought I might never...

418
00:36:38,376 --> 00:36:39,079
What?

419
00:36:42,689 --> 00:36:43,654
...kiss you.

420
00:36:48,389 --> 00:36:51,158
DOOR OPENS
Ooh, sorry.

421
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,870
The Sheriff wants you. He's gonna put
Robin's head on a spike.

422
00:37:01,538 --> 00:37:05,526
We must continue
this conversation soon. Guy!

423
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:16,950
D'you know, I might have more work for you. Are you
staying in England? I may return to the Holy Land.

424
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:22,476
Not to help King Richard?
I've had enough of fighting Saracens.

425
00:37:23,263 --> 00:37:25,213
I would, however,
like to learn more of their tricks.

426
00:37:26,337 --> 00:37:28,293
They are way ahead of us
with potions and remedies.

427
00:37:30,718 --> 00:37:33,702
They make a concoction to reduce
the breathing of a man to nothing.

428
00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:38,055
He seems to be dead, but is not.
Fascinating.

429
00:37:38,762 --> 00:37:43,212
A clue. And when the same man drinks
the opposing concoction,

430
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:47,496
he comes back to life -
just like that.

431
00:37:49,229 --> 00:37:51,978
Really? Just like what?
Just like this!

432
00:37:57,262 --> 00:37:58,080
Alive?!

433
00:37:59,650 --> 00:37:59,869
Oh!

434
00:38:04,183 --> 00:38:08,510
Oh, really! I'll take that money.
I'm not paying you now -

435
00:38:09,157 --> 00:38:11,872
now that the stiff has
stepped off the stretcher!

436
00:38:14,183 --> 00:38:15,822
Kneel. Make me.

437
00:38:16,638 --> 00:38:19,249
Oh! With pleasure.

438
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:27,992
What's she doing here?
She saved your life.

439
00:38:31,045 --> 00:38:33,997
Guy... I have to go.

440
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,998
Go? You can't go.

441
00:38:37,293 --> 00:38:42,280
I can. And I must. Look, this was a
mistake. Marian, this wasn't a mistake.

442
00:38:42,542 --> 00:38:45,446
This was the most perfect thing that
has ever happened. I am grieving, Guy.

443
00:38:46,733 --> 00:38:48,258
I misled you. I'm sorry.

444
00:38:49,655 --> 00:38:50,945
I'm sorry.

445
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,586
You're misleading yourself.

446
00:38:53,852 --> 00:38:57,309
I know. I've done it.
I told myself I didn't need you,

447
00:38:58,793 --> 00:39:03,194
that other things would satisfy me -
politics, power.

448
00:39:04,085 --> 00:39:06,854
Yet here we are. I have to get back.

449
00:39:07,604 --> 00:39:09,381
Before they realise I'm missing.

450
00:39:09,758 --> 00:39:13,837
Back to the convent? Yes. Marian, no.

451
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,116
I forbid you to go.

452
00:39:23,382 --> 00:39:24,408
(See you back at the camp.)

453
00:39:31,695 --> 00:39:35,694
BELLS TOLL Alarm! They're in the
castle! Looks like they're missing us.

454
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:39,050
Are you ready? Are you sure
you don't want to kill anyone?

455
00:39:39,894 --> 00:39:44,568
We're much more likely to get killed ourselves.
Ah, come on. We're much too good for that!

456
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,992
All right. Let's find out.

457
00:39:50,368 --> 00:39:51,356
Search everywhere!

458
00:40:07,329 --> 00:40:08,621
Carter! Quick!

459
00:40:15,562 --> 00:40:16,532
Quick!

460
00:40:51,266 --> 00:40:52,651
Robin! Here! Robin!

461
00:41:01,713 --> 00:41:04,932
Do you do this often?
It seems to, yeah!

462
00:41:05,265 --> 00:41:06,651
It really would be simpler
to kill them.

463
00:41:07,744 --> 00:41:10,465
I know. But where
would be the fun in that, eh?

464
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:17,946
I'd better be off.
Are you sure you don't want to stay?

465
00:41:18,436 --> 00:41:21,854
I do. But I'm going back to the Holy
Land. I want to visit my brother's grave.

466
00:41:22,876 --> 00:41:25,002
Say goodbye properly.
Tell him I'm sorry.

467
00:41:26,171 --> 00:41:27,321
I thought I was honouring his memory.

468
00:41:29,307 --> 00:41:32,403
And I thought I could do something
useful. Warn King Richard for you.

469
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:35,995
Thank you.

470
00:41:40,653 --> 00:41:43,836
MARIAN SIGHS
Well, you disobeyed me.

471
00:41:44,464 --> 00:41:45,539
I saved your life!

472
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:49,789
And you kissed Gisborne.
And you tied me up.

473
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:52,432
And you could have got
us all killed. I'm sorry.

474
00:41:54,403 --> 00:41:55,914
I'm not used to taking orders.

475
00:41:57,526 --> 00:41:58,518
But I can learn.

476
00:42:00,186 --> 00:42:02,187
I'd like to be part of your gang.

477
00:42:03,668 --> 00:42:05,433
And I'm not used to you being
in the forest, but...

478
00:42:06,918 --> 00:42:10,123
I'll learn. Truce?

479
00:42:10,947 --> 00:42:12,948
Yeah, truce.

480
00:42:15,871 --> 00:42:16,826
Safe journey, my friend.

481
00:42:56,016 --> 00:42:57,139
There's a messenger here.

482
00:42:57,168 --> 00:42:59,102
From Lady Marian? No, from the King.

483
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:06,398
He wants me to send a note back with Lardner.
Beware of the power of Lardner's ring.

484
00:43:07,011 --> 00:43:10,576
What is Lardner's ring?
Robin, the Sheriff's coming!

485
00:43:10,871 --> 00:43:13,694
You're surrounded, Hood!
Maybe you could use me as a hostage?

486
00:43:14,356 --> 00:43:18,327
Gisborne! If I die, Marian dies.
Marian!

487
00:43:18,472 --> 00:43:19,831
Will you marry me? What?!
