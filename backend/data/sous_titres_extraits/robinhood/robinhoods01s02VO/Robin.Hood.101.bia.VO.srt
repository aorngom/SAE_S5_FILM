1
00:00:40,873 --> 00:00:41,631
Hold hand.

2
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:43,528
You know the law.

3
00:00:43,529 --> 00:00:44,529
I know the law is an ass.

4
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,430
The price for one of the King's deer

5
00:00:47,434 --> 00:00:48,731
is your right hand.

6
00:00:49,032 --> 00:00:49,632
Let's go.

7
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:50,778
No...

8
00:00:51,548 --> 00:00:52,733
Please, have mercy...

9
00:00:53,063 --> 00:00:53,734
My wife...

10
00:00:54,198 --> 00:00:54,506
What ?

11
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,038
My wife expects a child.

12
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,037
We have no food.

13
00:00:57,534 --> 00:00:59,792
She must eat or we'll lose the baby.

14
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:00,375
Then...

15
00:01:00,376 --> 00:01:01,637
when she has the baby,

16
00:01:01,638 --> 00:01:04,555
you will say you must steal because
you have another mouth to feed.

17
00:01:04,858 --> 00:01:05,450
Bring him.

18
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,130
Please, no, I need my hands.

19
00:01:07,536 --> 00:01:08,820
We can punish you now,

20
00:01:09,924 --> 00:01:14,447
if you admit your guilt and save us the time
the punishment is lessened we can take a finger

21
00:01:14,448 --> 00:01:17,496
but you will have no right to trial,
no defense, no appeal.

22
00:01:17,756 --> 00:01:19,030
I will lose a trial

23
00:01:19,414 --> 00:01:20,402
and my hand.

24
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,426
Take the finger.

25
00:01:24,591 --> 00:01:25,008
Good.

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,057
Come on !

27
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:33,285
Put your hand on there

28
00:01:33,735 --> 00:01:35,041
like this.

29
00:01:37,183 --> 00:01:37,874
No.

30
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:39,335
I've changed my mind.

31
00:01:39,422 --> 00:01:40,564
No appeal.

32
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:44,932
What the...

33
00:01:48,313 --> 00:01:49,126
Who is there ?

34
00:01:49,636 --> 00:01:51,404
Seems I missed your hand.

35
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:54,017
Let him go before my aim improves!

36
00:01:54,496 --> 00:01:55,550
Show yourself !

37
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:57,757
You interfere with the law of the land.

38
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:01,164
The last time I looked,

39
00:02:02,025 --> 00:02:05,462
the law punished poaching with
a tanning or a spell in the stocks.

40
00:02:05,656 --> 00:02:09,213
The law is under threat and must
be severe if it is to be respected.

41
00:02:09,214 --> 00:02:10,706
If the law wants respect,

42
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,800
shouldn't the punishment fit the crime ?

43
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:14,227
I do not make the law.

44
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,501
I do not decide.

45
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,906
But you enforce it.

46
00:02:17,356 --> 00:02:19,211
And my men and I suggest

47
00:02:19,212 --> 00:02:21,056
that you decide to go on your way.

48
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,446
We got surrounded, Sir.

49
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:37,879
And let this man feed his only wife.

50
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,592
I don't know.

51
00:02:38,593 --> 00:02:39,185
You know.

52
00:02:45,676 --> 00:02:46,653
And what does that prove ?

53
00:02:50,536 --> 00:02:51,393
Missed again.

54
00:02:52,121 --> 00:02:52,999
Let him go !

55
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:55,576
God bless you, Sir.

56
00:02:55,577 --> 00:02:56,981
God bless you, all gensy.

57
00:02:58,584 --> 00:02:59,067
Come on !

58
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,338
We leave these rogues to their crimes.

59
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,336
Assholes...

60
00:03:09,961 --> 00:03:10,807
Rogues...

61
00:03:11,751 --> 00:03:13,848
Don't show your faces here again.

62
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:14,825
Cowards !

63
00:03:15,326 --> 00:03:16,128
Quiet !

64
00:03:16,293 --> 00:03:16,907
Why ?

65
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,047
We have won and they should be ashamed !

66
00:03:20,498 --> 00:03:21,947
Shame on you !

67
00:03:22,163 --> 00:03:24,440
Come back here again and my master and I

68
00:03:24,441 --> 00:03:29,152
shall see that you leave with more
than just your tails between your legs.

69
00:03:29,382 --> 00:03:31,029
"My master and I..."

70
00:03:31,621 --> 00:03:33,137
There are only two of them !

71
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:35,091
I shouldn't have said that !

72
00:03:35,738 --> 00:03:37,116
Run, Robin !

73
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,917
Run !

74
00:04:50,673 --> 00:04:51,208
Awesome.

75
00:05:24,974 --> 00:05:26,831
Five years in battle, Much.

76
00:05:27,384 --> 00:05:29,856
And you still forget the last man !

77
00:05:30,428 --> 00:05:32,226
I've always so much to remember.

78
00:05:34,956 --> 00:05:37,376
When I see the river train, I'm gonna weep.

79
00:05:38,535 --> 00:05:40,056
I'm gonna cry like a baby.

80
00:05:41,605 --> 00:05:44,673
For all the pain we suffered in Palestine.
The horrors we have witnessed.

81
00:05:45,485 --> 00:05:48,034
And because I am so hungry.

82
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,729
When we get to Locksley
I'm gonna have beef.

83
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:53,218
Yesterday you said pig.

84
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,058
Oh yesterday I was not so hungry.

85
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,702
I mean I could have pig
and the beef.

86
00:05:57,884 --> 00:05:58,739
And lamb.

87
00:05:59,783 --> 00:06:00,699
I'd like that,

88
00:06:01,377 --> 00:06:02,233
very much.

89
00:06:02,647 --> 00:06:03,295
In fact,

90
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,225
I can feel a song coming on.

91
00:06:06,226 --> 00:06:06,812
No.

92
00:06:07,429 --> 00:06:08,267
No song !

93
00:06:08,492 --> 00:06:09,987
Absolutely no song !

94
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:11,689
It'd be a cheery song !

95
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,357
And it would be a tragedy too !

96
00:06:13,358 --> 00:06:16,174
A tragedy for you to have survived the Turk,

97
00:06:16,498 --> 00:06:18,822
and made it to within a few miles of Locksley,

98
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,138
only to be killed by your own master !

99
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:25,336
You know it is lucky I do not readily take offence.

100
00:06:26,097 --> 00:06:27,989
You know, a smaller man will be offended.

101
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:30,679
A smaller man would be wounded.

102
00:06:30,826 --> 00:06:33,556
And a cleverer man would sing fewer songs.

103
00:06:34,614 --> 00:06:37,224
So master, no stop in here, allright ?

104
00:06:37,601 --> 00:06:39,939
No stop in anywhere, no more heroics.

105
00:06:40,408 --> 00:06:42,033
We're going home. We're going straight...

106
00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:42,821
home.

107
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:46,625
My friend...

108
00:06:47,977 --> 00:06:48,944
You two are on the run.

109
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:49,432
No.

110
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,733
We're returning to Locksley after a long absence.

111
00:06:52,972 --> 00:06:54,230
You look like you're on the run.

112
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,880
Want to get me out with this stitch ?

113
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:00,082
There's a good meal in it.

114
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,556
Me daughter Sarah and I.

115
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,862
We've a proper roasting?

116
00:07:03,728 --> 00:07:04,676
Master we could, couldn't we ?

117
00:07:04,677 --> 00:07:06,197
Much we are nearly home.

118
00:07:06,273 --> 00:07:07,343
Please...

119
00:07:08,484 --> 00:07:09,517
Please

120
00:07:12,634 --> 00:07:13,470
I love you.

121
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:14,916
Haven't I said that ?

122
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:18,264
Go on, dig it !

123
00:07:18,265 --> 00:07:18,911
Rust

124
00:07:18,912 --> 00:07:20,641
Have you ever done a proper day's work ?

125
00:07:20,915 --> 00:07:21,563
Rust.

126
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:23,253
Poke.

127
00:07:23,883 --> 00:07:24,718
Rust.

128
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:25,744
Poke.

129
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:27,124
Rust.

130
00:07:28,335 --> 00:07:28,946
Poke.

131
00:07:37,093 --> 00:07:37,797
Thank you !

132
00:07:40,473 --> 00:07:41,525
Where you two headed ?

133
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:42,079
Home.

134
00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:44,306
To Locksley

135
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,565
It's going late.

136
00:07:46,325 --> 00:07:48,541
You and your friend should stay in our bound tonight.

137
00:07:50,593 --> 00:07:51,983
That is very kind but I...

138
00:07:51,984 --> 00:07:53,255
don't think it would be.

139
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:54,805
Someone special waiting for you, Sir

140
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:55,941
In Locksley ?

141
00:07:58,293 --> 00:07:59,110
I doubt it.

142
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:01,382
- Listen my friend and I...
- Then what's the hurry ?

143
00:08:02,171 --> 00:08:03,241
Your father !

144
00:08:03,572 --> 00:08:04,267
He'd kill you...

145
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,544
If he saw...

146
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:07,591
- Sarah ! I'd...
- But he won't !

147
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:08,398
...see.

148
00:08:11,255 --> 00:08:12,880
Sheriff wants clothes dyed for his men,

149
00:08:13,246 --> 00:08:14,232
in rough taxes

150
00:08:14,354 --> 00:08:17,133
Taxes that I can't afford because
nobody has any money to buy my clothes.

151
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:27,411
Well !

152
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,214
You know he's a... fair-minded old man.

153
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:33,338
I'm sure if you explain...

154
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,226
your difficulties to, and if you...

155
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,052
Kissing.

156
00:08:36,523 --> 00:08:37,713
- Kiss him ?!
- Kiss his ring !

157
00:08:38,887 --> 00:08:39,892
He will understand.

158
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:41,450
You really have been away.

159
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:43,384
The old man is finished,

160
00:08:44,204 --> 00:08:46,411
we've got a new sheriff these last four years.

161
00:08:47,904 --> 00:08:49,218
- Where is that food?
- Really ?

162
00:08:50,514 --> 00:08:51,735
True, that is interesting !

163
00:08:52,754 --> 00:08:53,486
Because...

164
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:55,542
he's a fair-minded old man.

165
00:08:55,852 --> 00:08:56,613
I told you.

166
00:08:57,242 --> 00:08:58,219
With a new younger...

167
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:00,426
You're not listening ?

168
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:10,321
Robin !

169
00:09:11,882 --> 00:09:12,671
My daughter !

170
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,929
I made no offence.

171
00:09:14,201 --> 00:09:15,365
I do not wish to fight !

172
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,154
Oh bad luck !

173
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:16,999
I do !

174
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,912
You put the wrong man to mess with.

175
00:09:27,044 --> 00:09:28,433
I did not always wear clothes

176
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:29,776
I once wore metal.

177
00:09:30,705 --> 00:09:33,965
Never beaten with a sword
nor by a knight nor by a knave.

178
00:09:40,197 --> 00:09:40,873
Much !

179
00:09:46,923 --> 00:09:47,627
Master !

180
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,297
Much.

181
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:13,725
Fetch the packs.

182
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,030
Run !

183
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,054
Wo-oh ! Sir !

184
00:10:30,288 --> 00:10:30,814
Sir !

185
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:32,138
You have me !

186
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:34,865
Allow me one final request.

187
00:10:35,024 --> 00:10:35,926
What's that?

188
00:10:37,344 --> 00:10:38,198
One last kiss !

189
00:10:57,499 --> 00:11:01,715
I told you. I said no slubbering.
Why do you ever ever listen !

190
00:11:02,318 --> 00:11:03,839
Faster. Go.

191
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:21,907
Not saying anything ?

192
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:02,527
Hey there !

193
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,670
Where is everybody ?

194
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:22,994
Dan Scarlett !

195
00:12:24,887 --> 00:12:26,136
Dan ! It's me, Robin !

196
00:12:26,137 --> 00:12:26,850
Robin ?

197
00:12:26,851 --> 00:12:27,507
Yes.

198
00:12:27,508 --> 00:12:31,235
- Is it really you ?
- Of course this is ! We are home unscathed.

199
00:12:31,845 --> 00:12:32,418
Well !

200
00:12:32,729 --> 00:12:33,255
Scathed.

201
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:34,538
Very scathed.

202
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:35,646
But happy,

203
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,828
and hungry,

204
00:12:36,988 --> 00:12:37,824
mostly hungry !

205
00:12:37,825 --> 00:12:40,239
Blessed Mary, it's you !

206
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,319
- An accident ?
- Hum... an incident !

207
00:12:50,211 --> 00:12:51,056
No matter !

208
00:12:51,706 --> 00:12:53,161
- What's done is done !
- Tell me !

209
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:57,733
Guy of Gisborne runs your estate

210
00:12:58,139 --> 00:12:58,994
for the Sheriff.

211
00:12:59,722 --> 00:13:00,389
Does he ?

212
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,722
We have one tide after another
for the King in the Holy Land

213
00:13:03,723 --> 00:13:05,536
making ends meet.

214
00:13:06,822 --> 00:13:07,883
It was wrong,

215
00:13:08,475 --> 00:13:10,287
but my boys, they took some gain

216
00:13:10,929 --> 00:13:13,229
I went to stop them, but so did Gisborne law.

217
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:14,647
They got caught.

218
00:13:15,192 --> 00:13:15,868
Me too.

219
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,215
Someone had to lose a hand.

220
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,067
Better me than Will

221
00:13:20,311 --> 00:13:21,316
A little lucky.

222
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,734
I'm old.

223
00:13:23,363 --> 00:13:24,583
They got years ahead of them.

224
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:25,926
This is madness.

225
00:13:26,662 --> 00:13:28,991
You are a skilled man.
You built half this village.

226
00:13:30,183 --> 00:13:32,164
I won't allow this. You will be compensated.

227
00:13:32,165 --> 00:13:34,174
I see my boys in good health

228
00:13:34,175 --> 00:13:35,359
and I am happy.

229
00:13:37,613 --> 00:13:39,031
It's alright boys !

230
00:13:40,101 --> 00:13:41,519
This is Master Robin.

231
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,618
You're allright !

232
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:43,410
Come on !

233
00:13:47,634 --> 00:13:48,535
This is my bow.

234
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:51,380
My-my dad made it for me.

235
00:13:52,315 --> 00:13:54,109
Why has yours got these curves in it?

236
00:13:54,813 --> 00:13:56,963
Well, this... is a Sarrasin bow.

237
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:58,860
It is recurved.

238
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:01,010
The bow straighten..

239
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:02,474
when you draw.

240
00:14:03,226 --> 00:14:04,606
Makes it small,

241
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:05,977
but powerful.

242
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,038
Is it true you can...

243
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,456
hit a man from a mile away?

244
00:14:11,658 --> 00:14:13,217
If I practice everyday I'll be able to do that!

245
00:14:13,218 --> 00:14:15,585
Well, let's hope you never
have to shoot the man, Luke.

246
00:14:16,101 --> 00:14:17,481
Yeah, that's what dad says.

247
00:14:18,965 --> 00:14:20,871
But you killed loads of men
when you fought with the King!

248
00:14:23,402 --> 00:14:23,890
Look !

249
00:14:27,036 --> 00:14:28,444
Ok, give me channel

250
00:14:29,055 --> 00:14:30,153
And remember to...

251
00:14:30,857 --> 00:14:32,144
to take a breath first.

252
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:33,363
Wait ! Wait !

253
00:14:34,405 --> 00:14:35,748
He's a credit to you and Jane.

254
00:14:39,742 --> 00:14:40,530
No.

255
00:14:41,526 --> 00:14:42,361
Two years.

256
00:14:43,554 --> 00:14:44,859
They told us she wasn't eating

257
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,099
Told me she was...

258
00:14:46,962 --> 00:14:48,465
Couldn't see a boy starve.

259
00:14:49,898 --> 00:14:51,692
The whole village has suffered.

260
00:14:51,823 --> 00:14:52,865
Not just us.

261
00:14:53,213 --> 00:14:53,926
Jane.

262
00:14:55,504 --> 00:14:57,109
Your good strong wife.

263
00:15:18,244 --> 00:15:21,652
Come on ! Come on, stand there !

264
00:15:21,653 --> 00:15:22,852
And don't move !

265
00:15:22,853 --> 00:15:25,397
Ten sacks of flour have gone missing from the store.

266
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:27,651
They will be found !

267
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,123
Go on, get out of here with the rest of them !

268
00:15:31,574 --> 00:15:32,813
You'll be accounted for !

269
00:15:33,311 --> 00:15:37,123
Come on, stop stroking !
Good, get out of here !

270
00:15:37,124 --> 00:15:38,560
No more, Sir !

271
00:15:41,176 --> 00:15:42,538
Who helped this...

272
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:43,824
runt ?

273
00:15:46,595 --> 00:15:48,670
Step forward now and I may show lenience.

274
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:53,064
No

275
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:58,327
The main perpetrators would be found.
This crime would be punished, bring the boy.

276
00:15:58,328 --> 00:15:58,806
Wait !

277
00:16:02,555 --> 00:16:05,606
- Guy of Gisborne
- Sir Guy of Gisborne to you.

278
00:16:05,607 --> 00:16:07,665
and bow before your master !

279
00:16:08,407 --> 00:16:09,900
Sir Guy of Gisborne.

280
00:16:10,821 --> 00:16:13,647
My name is Robin. Earl of Huntington
and Lord of this manor.

281
00:16:14,624 --> 00:16:16,614
Your services here are no longer required.

282
00:16:40,022 --> 00:16:40,698
Charles !

283
00:16:41,862 --> 00:16:42,407
Thomas !

284
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:49,967
Welcome back, Sir !

285
00:16:52,953 --> 00:16:54,183
A bath for the Master !

286
00:16:54,558 --> 00:16:56,755
And... and fresh clothes immediately.

287
00:16:56,756 --> 00:16:57,836
Merig !

288
00:16:58,089 --> 00:16:59,000
And me too !

289
00:16:59,244 --> 00:16:59,808
Pardon ?

290
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:00,775
Thornton,

291
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,385
Much is no longer my manservant.

292
00:17:03,996 --> 00:17:04,568
Hum ?!

293
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:07,435
In recognition of the services
to me in the Holy Land.

294
00:17:08,036 --> 00:17:09,585
He's to be made a free man !

295
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:12,256
I'm granting the fields of Lodget Bondchett.

296
00:17:12,257 --> 00:17:13,179
Until then...

297
00:17:13,451 --> 00:17:15,235
he's a guest... in my house.

298
00:17:17,498 --> 00:17:21,442
And I would like a plate
of something while I bathe.

299
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:22,606
Very well.

300
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,517
That is the way to the servants' quarters.

301
00:17:29,888 --> 00:17:30,789
I knew that!

302
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,475
Welcome back, Locksley !

303
00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:39,508
Now.

304
00:17:40,246 --> 00:17:42,969
I have... kept your lands for you !

305
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,626
I have managed your estates to the best of my
ability, under the guidance of the Sheriff.

306
00:17:49,287 --> 00:17:53,033
And I would appreciate more respect
in front of the populace.

307
00:17:53,231 --> 00:17:54,911
How many years have you been here ?

308
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,130
Three years, four winters.

309
00:17:58,003 --> 00:18:00,660
And yet you still do not have the respect of the populace.

310
00:18:02,171 --> 00:18:05,523
- My men and I will leave directly for Nottingham !
- My servants will help you pack !

311
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:08,500
How was the Holy Land ?

312
00:18:09,363 --> 00:18:10,351
Bloodthirsty.

313
00:18:12,307 --> 00:18:15,124
I understand the King is winning, thanks be to God.

314
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,341
He's killing more people.

315
00:18:16,342 --> 00:18:17,393
How is that not winning ?

316
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:20,914
Show me an argument, ever settled with
bloodshed and then I'll call it winning.

317
00:18:20,915 --> 00:18:23,027
Do not pretend that you do not love war.

318
00:18:23,321 --> 00:18:24,354
I've seen you fight.

319
00:18:24,626 --> 00:18:25,218
When ?

320
00:18:26,035 --> 00:18:27,331
I do not recall.

321
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:30,988
I have changed.

322
00:18:34,622 --> 00:18:38,434
A council of nobles meets tomorrow.
Nottingham have no doubt the Sheriff will

323
00:18:38,435 --> 00:18:40,950
call a feast to celebrate your safe return.

324
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:41,542
Goodbye !

325
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:42,669
Goodbye !

326
00:18:43,974 --> 00:18:44,810
One thing !

327
00:18:47,382 --> 00:18:49,589
I should celebrate my safe return too.

328
00:18:49,674 --> 00:18:53,336
By pardonning any wrong doers from my
estates waiting trial and punishment.

329
00:18:53,337 --> 00:18:55,064
Only the Sheriff can pardon, you know that !

330
00:18:55,065 --> 00:18:58,641
It is custom for the Sheriff to acceed his nobles requests on such matters.

331
00:18:58,642 --> 00:19:01,148
Well then I suggest you take it with the Sheriff.

332
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:17,775
Was it horrible ?

333
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:20,310
The war ? What was it like ?

334
00:19:20,752 --> 00:19:21,991
War is for...

335
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:23,550
for men.

336
00:19:25,015 --> 00:19:25,878
You would be upset.

337
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:26,891
Little one.

338
00:19:27,201 --> 00:19:27,670
Yeah ?

339
00:19:28,516 --> 00:19:31,041
I heard that dying men always ask for their mums.

340
00:19:35,614 --> 00:19:36,506
That's for the bath.

341
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:37,502
What ?

342
00:19:38,037 --> 00:19:39,173
Rose petals !

343
00:19:46,609 --> 00:19:47,455
I knew that !

344
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:10,246
Much !

345
00:20:10,894 --> 00:20:11,513
Get dressed !

346
00:20:11,955 --> 00:20:13,466
We're gonna visit the old Sheriff.

347
00:20:14,358 --> 00:20:14,894
Really ?

348
00:20:15,412 --> 00:20:18,726
I would prefer... I have to say... the whole

349
00:20:18,727 --> 00:20:19,487
food,

350
00:20:19,488 --> 00:20:20,200
bath,

351
00:20:20,201 --> 00:20:20,848
sleep

352
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:21,299
thing.

353
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,106
Of course.

354
00:20:22,107 --> 00:20:23,393
I forgot my promess to you.

355
00:20:24,197 --> 00:20:25,277
You don't have to go.

356
00:20:27,098 --> 00:20:27,943
Is something wrong ?

357
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,718
England is wrong.

358
00:20:30,741 --> 00:20:32,366
And Nottingham Sheriff worse.

359
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:34,889
The old Sheriff would never've allowed this.

360
00:20:35,236 --> 00:20:37,649
I have to hear his story before I go to Nottingham tomorrow.

361
00:20:41,971 --> 00:20:43,492
Sleep well, my friend !

362
00:20:44,638 --> 00:20:45,539
You've earned it !

363
00:20:55,197 --> 00:20:56,267
Master !

364
00:20:56,718 --> 00:20:58,540
Master, the food !

365
00:20:58,541 --> 00:20:59,810
Go to the village.

366
00:21:00,242 --> 00:21:02,543
Bring every family here, and feed them.

367
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,660
Nobody here eats until they do, including me.

368
00:21:05,661 --> 00:21:06,697
Those who're ill,

369
00:21:07,477 --> 00:21:08,237
Take the food to them.

370
00:21:08,238 --> 00:21:09,047
Yes, master !

371
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:09,648
Here

372
00:21:10,765 --> 00:21:12,831
I hope that you don't mean that
by "nobody eating"?

373
00:21:14,362 --> 00:21:17,883
No. No of course not.

374
00:21:18,354 --> 00:21:19,068
That's fine !

375
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:21,509
That's... fine !

376
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:25,856
Has anyone seen my horse ?

377
00:21:33,093 --> 00:21:33,938
Get out !

378
00:21:34,201 --> 00:21:35,037
Get away from here !

379
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:35,891
Edward !

380
00:21:36,145 --> 00:21:38,070
It's me, your friend. Robin of Locksley !

381
00:21:38,071 --> 00:21:39,074
I know who you are !

382
00:21:39,447 --> 00:21:40,978
Crooks, come to deceive me !?

383
00:21:40,979 --> 00:21:42,170
I allow none of you here !

384
00:21:42,171 --> 00:21:44,255
I swear, I come in friendship !

385
00:21:44,256 --> 00:21:45,344
Get away !

386
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,062
I'm no longer the Sheriff !

387
00:21:47,553 --> 00:21:49,318
Leave me to live here my days in peace.

388
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:51,280
You heard my father, leave !

389
00:21:52,463 --> 00:21:53,111
Marian.

390
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,904
It's me, Robin.

391
00:21:56,204 --> 00:21:57,453
Congratulations.

392
00:21:57,735 --> 00:21:58,504
Leave.

393
00:21:58,505 --> 00:21:59,220
How are you ?

394
00:22:00,394 --> 00:22:01,840
- I thought of you.
- Leave !

395
00:22:03,061 --> 00:22:03,756
We're leaving.

396
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,846
Sir Edward, if you do not remember me,
remember Nottingham !

397
00:22:06,847 --> 00:22:08,029
Remember your people !

398
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:10,903
- Interesting.
- Interesting ?

399
00:22:12,229 --> 00:22:13,346
It's unbelievable !

400
00:22:14,961 --> 00:22:16,295
He used to treat us like...

401
00:22:16,296 --> 00:22:17,515
like sons !

402
00:22:17,516 --> 00:22:18,849
She's still unmarried.

403
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:19,781
Oh !

404
00:22:20,504 --> 00:22:22,983
And I thought you come
to see the old Sheriff !

405
00:22:23,697 --> 00:22:24,439
I did !

406
00:22:26,073 --> 00:22:27,068
Please !

407
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:35,792
Bless you, master Robin !

408
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,226
- We have all eaten well.
- Is there any food left ?

409
00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:39,869
I must confess I'm anxious !

410
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:40,771
Robin !

411
00:22:40,932 --> 00:22:41,636
Robin !

412
00:22:41,852 --> 00:22:42,631
Jeffrey ?

413
00:22:42,632 --> 00:22:43,467
Do you remember this ?

414
00:22:43,749 --> 00:22:44,566
Remember this ?

415
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,171
<i>My egg</i>

416
00:22:46,641 --> 00:22:47,946
<i>My egg, where's it gone ?</i>

417
00:22:50,262 --> 00:22:51,990
<i>- You've eaten it.
-No, I haven't !</i>

418
00:22:53,182 --> 00:22:54,750
Here, it is !

419
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:57,224
You used to love that
when you were a lad.

420
00:22:57,712 --> 00:22:59,008
Have you had lots to eat ?

421
00:22:59,658 --> 00:23:00,690
You're a good boy !

422
00:23:01,425 --> 00:23:02,646
Thanks for feeding us !

423
00:23:03,303 --> 00:23:05,012
Come on, Ben !
Bring those eggs !

424
00:23:05,397 --> 00:23:06,280
Come on !

425
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:10,131
That man is a show-off !

426
00:23:10,346 --> 00:23:12,262
If there are no eggs left
I'm going after him.

427
00:23:12,853 --> 00:23:13,210
Dan ?!

428
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:15,672
What's wrong ?

429
00:23:15,673 --> 00:23:17,428
Young Benedict got frightened

430
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:20,291
He told Gisborne's lot
who took the flowers.

431
00:23:20,939 --> 00:23:21,681
Your boys ?

432
00:23:22,939 --> 00:23:24,375
They've taken them to Nottingham !

433
00:23:25,427 --> 00:23:26,018
Robin !

434
00:23:26,459 --> 00:23:27,614
I will resolve this !

435
00:23:28,469 --> 00:23:30,319
I will talk to the Sheriff,
I promise !

436
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,133
Where is everybody ?

437
00:24:27,144 --> 00:24:29,076
Funny Wednesday, it used to be market day !

438
00:24:30,412 --> 00:24:33,069
I think Wednesday may still be market day.

439
00:24:35,898 --> 00:24:37,682
I'm sure there's some mistake.

440
00:24:47,554 --> 00:24:49,741
My Lord, I do not think that
this is a laughing matter !

441
00:24:49,742 --> 00:24:52,708
Sorry, remind me !
How many men do you have ?

442
00:24:55,138 --> 00:24:56,227
Twenty-four.

443
00:24:56,783 --> 00:24:58,337
- And he had...
- One.

444
00:24:58,968 --> 00:25:00,865
- But the point is...
- How did you let him take the house ?

445
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,828
Technically it is still his property.

446
00:25:07,232 --> 00:25:09,119
I would have appreciated more support

447
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,030
in this matter.

448
00:25:10,031 --> 00:25:11,148
Relax !

449
00:25:11,149 --> 00:25:12,143
Relax !

450
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:13,955
I'll give it back to you within a month

451
00:25:17,854 --> 00:25:19,620
Twenty-four... One...

452
00:25:37,143 --> 00:25:38,842
It has been a good month,

453
00:25:38,843 --> 00:25:41,472
we've collected nearly 300 pounds.

454
00:25:44,392 --> 00:25:49,429
Would you want to be the King in Antioch?
Clue : No.

455
00:25:50,171 --> 00:25:52,857
Trying to feed a starving army on 300 pounds,

456
00:25:52,858 --> 00:25:53,946
You promise...

457
00:25:55,073 --> 00:25:55,749
500 pounds.

458
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,350
It's...It's more than we've ever managed before.

459
00:25:58,463 --> 00:25:59,843
Oh ! Youpee !

460
00:26:00,494 --> 00:26:01,602
So, the King...

461
00:26:01,677 --> 00:26:04,081
is starving in the Holy Land
and you have failed him.

462
00:26:04,391 --> 00:26:05,095
But !

463
00:26:05,968 --> 00:26:08,108
"It's more than we've ever managed before."

464
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:09,921
<i>Robin of Locksley !</i>

465
00:26:09,922 --> 00:26:11,123
Good morning, everyone !

466
00:26:14,145 --> 00:26:14,849
Sheriff !

467
00:26:17,262 --> 00:26:18,314
Oh, carry on !

468
00:26:20,736 --> 00:26:21,544
Locksley !

469
00:26:21,694 --> 00:26:25,337
Welcome back ! I saw Sir Guy of Gisborne
manage your estates to your satisfaction.

470
00:26:25,338 --> 00:26:28,135
I believe you he may have managed them to your satisfaction.

471
00:26:28,685 --> 00:26:31,089
Some of your peasants are unruly by the way.

472
00:26:31,746 --> 00:26:33,812
We have two in custody awaiting punishment.

473
00:26:33,943 --> 00:26:34,704
Three.

474
00:26:34,705 --> 00:26:35,258
Three.

475
00:26:35,774 --> 00:26:36,601
Oh, discipline

476
00:26:36,602 --> 00:26:39,281
will be a problem. Be warned ! Laugh brown.

477
00:26:39,469 --> 00:26:40,361
Sheriff, thank you !

478
00:26:40,652 --> 00:26:43,422
- I propose...
- Discipline has never been a problem on my estates.

479
00:26:44,328 --> 00:26:45,183
Times have changed.

480
00:26:45,184 --> 00:26:46,272
Not for the better !

481
00:26:46,976 --> 00:26:47,784
It seems...

482
00:26:48,434 --> 00:26:53,467
You, of all people, should know that
the King needs funds to fight our Holy War.

483
00:26:53,468 --> 00:26:56,603
Is it our Holy war, or is it Pope Gregory's ?

484
00:26:56,604 --> 00:26:59,230
We stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Rome.

485
00:26:59,231 --> 00:27:01,408
And we fall shoulder-to-shoulder too.

486
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:02,629
I have seen it.

487
00:27:02,732 --> 00:27:05,117
And then what is your proposal
to raise money for the King ?

488
00:27:05,192 --> 00:27:06,685
Stop all taxes !

489
00:27:07,267 --> 00:27:08,028
Today !

490
00:27:09,314 --> 00:27:09,990
Amusing

491
00:27:11,203 --> 00:27:12,349
I did not joke.

492
00:27:13,147 --> 00:27:14,461
Today is market day,

493
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:16,189
and yet there is no market.

494
00:27:16,555 --> 00:27:18,612
And your point is ?

495
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:22,038
If a man can make more
than he needs for his family,

496
00:27:22,329 --> 00:27:24,225
he can take what remains to market.

497
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:25,681
He can trade.

498
00:27:26,009 --> 00:27:27,239
The shire can

499
00:27:27,352 --> 00:27:28,516
take its share.

500
00:27:28,803 --> 00:27:31,160
But until then we must help every man,

501
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:34,878
every peasant, every peonman, every ??
provide for his family.

502
00:27:35,626 --> 00:27:36,931
Get him trading again.

503
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:43,424
A hungry man

504
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:45,696
who can

505
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:47,584
"provide"

506
00:27:48,029 --> 00:27:50,217
for his family is a
comfortable man, a lazy man !

507
00:27:50,818 --> 00:27:51,851
doesn't want to work.

508
00:27:51,852 --> 00:27:54,132
What we need are hungry men !

509
00:27:54,395 --> 00:27:55,963
Our noble friend

510
00:27:55,964 --> 00:27:57,306
seems to forget

511
00:27:58,349 --> 00:27:59,532
that hungry men

512
00:28:00,116 --> 00:28:01,027
are virtuous.

513
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:04,172
There is a celebration of my
return tonight in the Great hall

514
00:28:04,238 --> 00:28:04,792
Indeed.

515
00:28:05,027 --> 00:28:07,881
Won't I trust none of those "virtuous men"

516
00:28:07,882 --> 00:28:08,830
will be festing?

517
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:45,552
My father seems to think he should see you.

518
00:28:46,444 --> 00:28:47,655
Our house is watched.

519
00:28:47,761 --> 00:28:49,563
Come after midnight tonight.

520
00:28:49,564 --> 00:28:50,333
Very well.

521
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:53,301
You're looking... striky

522
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:57,359
And if you still live with your
father, that must mean...

523
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,514
Take care not to be seen.

524
00:28:58,515 --> 00:28:59,528
Don't worry.

525
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,237
I can look after myself.

526
00:29:01,304 --> 00:29:03,491
I don't care about you, I care about my father.

527
00:29:03,914 --> 00:29:05,886
Are you really as naive as you seem ?

528
00:29:06,712 --> 00:29:09,876
You think you can peak fights with
this people and get away with it ?

529
00:29:10,007 --> 00:29:12,092
You think you can slight them in public ?

530
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:13,651
You're a fool.

531
00:29:15,406 --> 00:29:16,590
Marian, wait !

532
00:29:17,726 --> 00:29:19,735
Now is not the time, I know.

533
00:29:20,228 --> 00:29:22,575
I must say, you are...

534
00:29:23,665 --> 00:29:24,914
more than ever...

535
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:26,604
Your eyes...

536
00:29:27,496 --> 00:29:29,561
and even when you look at me in anger...

537
00:29:30,956 --> 00:29:32,158
I feel you.

538
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:35,538
I believe

539
00:29:36,327 --> 00:29:37,651
you can still,

540
00:29:38,214 --> 00:29:40,158
even after all this time,

541
00:29:42,087 --> 00:29:44,059
you can see into my soul.

542
00:29:46,768 --> 00:29:50,149
Five years and you're still
peddling the same old drivel.

543
00:29:50,731 --> 00:29:51,830
Does it ever work ?

544
00:29:52,142 --> 00:29:53,532
You'd be surprised !

545
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,555
Amazed !

546
00:30:16,404 --> 00:30:18,103
Bring out the Locksley's lot !

547
00:30:21,643 --> 00:30:22,470
Hey, jailer !

548
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,230
Jailer, that's me !

549
00:30:25,812 --> 00:30:27,718
Jailer, are you listening ?

550
00:30:28,071 --> 00:30:29,573
I'm from Locksley !

551
00:30:30,042 --> 00:30:32,521
Jailer ! I'm from Locksley !

552
00:30:42,353 --> 00:30:43,367
Give your names !

553
00:30:44,728 --> 00:30:46,109
Will and Luke Scarlett.

554
00:30:47,104 --> 00:30:48,099
What is your crime ?

555
00:30:48,287 --> 00:30:50,042
Living at the wrong place at the wrong time.

556
00:30:50,343 --> 00:30:53,441
Living under an evil Sheriff. Where do
our taxes go ? They go to Nottingham.

557
00:30:53,442 --> 00:30:54,258
To the Sheriff !

558
00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:55,172
To his birds !

559
00:30:56,994 --> 00:30:57,645
Name ?!

560
00:30:57,936 --> 00:30:58,630
Benedict !

561
00:30:59,585 --> 00:31:01,003
Son of Richard Giddens.

562
00:31:01,004 --> 00:31:02,327
Servant of Locksley.

563
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:03,285
What is your crime ?

564
00:31:03,663 --> 00:31:04,771
Stealing flower !

565
00:31:04,772 --> 00:31:05,729
Are you guilty ?

566
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,348
What is your punishment ?

567
00:31:08,404 --> 00:31:09,306
Don't know !

568
00:31:11,475 --> 00:31:12,433
Hanging!?

569
00:31:12,907 --> 00:31:14,297
No, surely not !

570
00:31:15,226 --> 00:31:16,043
Hanging!

571
00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:17,461
- Robin !
- No.

572
00:31:17,696 --> 00:31:19,978
- No, please !
- Dad told me you would save us !

573
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:22,147
- No, please !
- Dad told me you would save us !

574
00:31:25,753 --> 00:31:26,720
Do you mind ?

575
00:31:27,147 --> 00:31:28,903
We don't tell them what is the dangle

576
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:30,583
They kick up the hell of a stink !

577
00:31:30,584 --> 00:31:31,748
For stealing flour !

578
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:32,983
Hanging?

579
00:31:32,984 --> 00:31:35,236
The Sheriff wants an example !
We just have word...

580
00:31:35,237 --> 00:31:37,011
I'll be speaking to the Sheriff !

581
00:31:38,203 --> 00:31:40,494
Meanwhile you treat these prisoners well,

582
00:31:41,194 --> 00:31:42,734
or you'll have me to want it too.

583
00:31:43,231 --> 00:31:44,095
We've got one more.

584
00:31:50,851 --> 00:31:51,941
You are not from Locksley.

585
00:31:52,917 --> 00:31:53,471
I know.

586
00:31:54,476 --> 00:31:55,696
But you saved me once before.

587
00:31:55,697 --> 00:31:58,406
That was a long way from
Nottingham, here I am known !

588
00:31:58,407 --> 00:32:00,556
Will you save me ?

589
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,265
For my wife !

590
00:32:02,266 --> 00:32:03,561
My newborn bab'.

591
00:32:03,562 --> 00:32:05,373
You said your wife was expecting !

592
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,669
Nope, she had it !

593
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,970
Your lies today may be your own doing.

594
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:12,927
I cannot save the others and now
I fear you'll share their fate !

595
00:32:13,105 --> 00:32:13,809
What fate ?

596
00:32:19,191 --> 00:32:20,478
I'm not from Locksley.

597
00:32:21,088 --> 00:32:22,506
Did-did I say Locksley ?

598
00:32:22,834 --> 00:32:25,144
There's been a mistake, here.
I'm from Rocksdale.

599
00:32:25,482 --> 00:32:26,458
Rocksdale !

600
00:32:26,459 --> 00:32:28,233
That's why they called me Allan A. Dale.

601
00:32:28,234 --> 00:32:30,421
- Yeah, and I'm from Wild Willus.
- No !

602
00:32:30,614 --> 00:32:32,238
Throw him with the Locksley lot.

603
00:32:41,308 --> 00:32:43,364
Huntington, you are missing your feast.

604
00:32:44,313 --> 00:32:45,308
Rumours abound.

605
00:32:45,674 --> 00:32:46,660
What rumours ?

606
00:32:46,905 --> 00:32:51,121
That you're weak, that you've returned
weakened from your exertion in the Holy Land.

607
00:32:51,122 --> 00:32:53,952
My master returns with honors, honors from the King !

608
00:32:55,781 --> 00:32:59,312
What a great honor,
it would have been to **

609
00:32:59,481 --> 00:33:01,743
I have visited my peasants in your dungeons.

610
00:33:02,187 --> 00:33:03,764
They have committed grave crimes.

611
00:33:03,914 --> 00:33:07,614
- Master surely...
- Which would make all the more compassionate your gesture of pardoning them.

612
00:33:07,906 --> 00:33:08,629
Pardonning them?

613
00:33:10,498 --> 00:33:12,122
I will see them hang.

614
00:33:13,271 --> 00:33:16,848
In the morning you yourself, said that
we risk rebellion. We must have order.

615
00:33:16,849 --> 00:33:20,757
It is custom for the Sheriff to hear
is noble request for damned sake...

616
00:33:23,615 --> 00:33:28,707
By the way ! In your absence we nominated
you to oversee tomorrow's entertainment.

617
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:29,342
No.

618
00:33:30,723 --> 00:33:33,042
You don't want these rumours witnessed to spread.

619
00:33:33,586 --> 00:33:34,657
Best to *** them now.

620
00:33:35,844 --> 00:33:37,074
Otherwise we don't ***

621
00:33:42,156 --> 00:33:42,804
Marian !

622
00:33:43,576 --> 00:33:45,358
Might I have the pleasure of your company ?

623
00:34:10,822 --> 00:34:11,225
Well !

624
00:34:11,948 --> 00:34:14,174
Don't just stand there, if the Sheriff's men see.

625
00:34:14,175 --> 00:34:14,596
What ?

626
00:34:15,113 --> 00:34:17,150
You might give them the pleasure of your company !

627
00:34:17,357 --> 00:34:18,014
Grow up !

628
00:34:18,653 --> 00:34:19,404
Forgive me !

629
00:34:19,798 --> 00:34:21,244
I could not welcome you before.

630
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:23,808
How did this monster become sheriff ?

631
00:34:23,809 --> 00:34:25,226
I did not watch my back.

632
00:34:26,221 --> 00:34:28,973
Prince John gives out the Shires
in his brother's absence.

633
00:34:28,974 --> 00:34:30,681
My bid was not accepted.

634
00:34:30,682 --> 00:34:31,573
What can be done ?

635
00:34:31,733 --> 00:34:32,737
I can do nothing !

636
00:34:33,235 --> 00:34:34,108
I'm watched !

637
00:34:34,784 --> 00:34:36,221
And I must think about my daughter !

638
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:39,193
When I do speak out, no one listens.

639
00:34:40,922 --> 00:34:42,856
Robin, it is done to you, my friend.

640
00:34:43,335 --> 00:34:44,349
What can we do ?

641
00:34:44,555 --> 00:34:45,804
Play Nottingham's game.

642
00:34:45,805 --> 00:34:46,940
Speak to the Lords.

643
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:51,480
Slowly, you can turn them. But do not make the mistake
I and others have made, and make your dissent public.

644
00:34:51,766 --> 00:34:53,991
Consolidate your position quietly.

645
00:34:53,992 --> 00:34:55,428
I do not have time.

646
00:34:55,531 --> 00:34:58,339
Tomorrow, I am to order the hanging
of four of my own peasants.

647
00:34:59,466 --> 00:35:01,185
It will be the long game, I'm afraid.

648
00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:03,476
Will and Luke Scarlett cannot wait.

649
00:35:03,532 --> 00:35:05,363
Benedict Giddens. Alan A. Dale.

650
00:35:05,364 --> 00:35:07,354
You must let them die, it is a test.

651
00:35:07,518 --> 00:35:09,856
Fail it and there will be consequences.

652
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,058
- Perhaps !
- Definitely !

653
00:35:11,312 --> 00:35:12,307
This is not a game...

654
00:35:13,283 --> 00:35:14,898
My daughter speaks when she should not.

655
00:35:15,077 --> 00:35:15,959
But she is right !

656
00:35:16,231 --> 00:35:17,302
You have no choice, Robin !

657
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:18,832
Hide your temper.

658
00:35:19,809 --> 00:35:20,804
Bide your time.

659
00:35:21,518 --> 00:35:23,264
until you can act decisively.

660
00:35:24,095 --> 00:35:26,649
Or kiss your lands, if not your life, goodbye.

661
00:36:05,084 --> 00:36:07,046
<i>Murderer ! Murderer !</i>

662
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:18,279
Robin.

663
00:36:19,518 --> 00:36:20,664
It's not your fault !

664
00:36:33,879 --> 00:36:35,698
Lords ! Ladies !

665
00:36:36,571 --> 00:36:40,412
People of Nottingham ! We are gathered here
today to witness the caring out of justice

666
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:43,881
In the name of God and King Richard !

667
00:36:43,882 --> 00:36:45,628
Bring out the prisoners !

668
00:36:51,196 --> 00:36:53,628
Robin Locksley, Earl of Huntington

669
00:36:53,872 --> 00:36:56,304
having recently returned from the Holy War with a

670
00:36:56,558 --> 00:36:59,121
personnal commandation from
the King himself, will read

671
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:00,774
proclamation.

672
00:37:02,117 --> 00:37:02,952
Enjoy.

673
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,725
Oh, and no second thoughts, Locksley,

674
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:13,476
or your friend, Much, will be drop in
on us as our special guest today.

675
00:37:21,957 --> 00:37:23,601
"Let it be heard and known,

676
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,755
about the lands and realms of Richard,

677
00:37:26,906 --> 00:37:28,821
his majesty, King of England,

678
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:32,718
that on this, the 26th day of April,

679
00:37:33,314 --> 00:37:36,375
in the year of our Lord 1192,

680
00:37:36,892 --> 00:37:38,216
the following men,

681
00:37:39,038 --> 00:37:41,780
having been tried on the law and found guilty,

682
00:37:42,653 --> 00:37:45,602
Benedict Giddens of Locksley,

683
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,616
Will Scarlett of Locksley,

684
00:37:48,919 --> 00:37:50,909
Luke Scarlett of Locksley,

685
00:37:51,238 --> 00:37:52,891
Alan A. Dale of Locksley,

686
00:37:53,492 --> 00:37:56,308
these same men have been
sentenced to hang by a rope

687
00:37:57,499 --> 00:37:58,907
until they are dead."

688
00:38:06,404 --> 00:38:08,701
Will ! Luke !

689
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:15,809
- May the soul...
- Wait !

690
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:22,550
Please, don't kill my brother, my little
baby, my inbred cousin !!!

691
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:27,180
On behalf of Anthony, our bishop, I claim
benefit of clergy for these men.

692
00:38:27,819 --> 00:38:28,889
They cannot hang.

693
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:30,335
These are not holy men,

694
00:38:31,274 --> 00:38:32,758
these people cannot plead the cloth.

695
00:38:33,171 --> 00:38:33,762
Get on with it.

696
00:38:34,053 --> 00:38:36,851
I came last night to administer their Last Rites.

697
00:38:39,001 --> 00:38:39,678
So ?

698
00:38:39,771 --> 00:38:42,185
And each one came to God through me,

699
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:45,063
repenting their sins and asking to take the cloth.

700
00:38:45,936 --> 00:38:49,936
I felt duty-bound to consult the bishop
and he, in turn, conferred status

701
00:38:50,147 --> 00:38:52,485
of novice onto each man.

702
00:38:52,486 --> 00:38:53,105
Shut up.

703
00:38:55,161 --> 00:38:56,579
"I, Anthony,

704
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,964
Very Reverend vicar apostolic,

705
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:01,523
- hereby confer..."
- Shut up !!

706
00:39:03,448 --> 00:39:04,321
Is this possible ?

707
00:39:04,438 --> 00:39:06,879
They could not have become novices overnight.

708
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,832
They are become postulants !

709
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,500
Novice novices, if you like.

710
00:39:11,763 --> 00:39:13,565
And so are under protection

711
00:39:13,566 --> 00:39:14,861
of the Church !

712
00:39:23,008 --> 00:39:23,937
"Novice novices" ?

713
00:39:24,491 --> 00:39:25,449
How novel !

714
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:29,759
Well, hang them... and arrest him !

715
00:39:38,177 --> 00:39:39,003
Mister Drum !

716
00:39:46,186 --> 00:39:47,332
Watch and enjoy, Robin !

717
00:39:48,909 --> 00:39:50,647
Owe your prisoners a talk

718
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:54,299
and then you'll be done for, my friend.

719
00:39:57,578 --> 00:40:01,295
<i>May the souls of these men find the innocence and health.</i>

720
00:40:07,642 --> 00:40:09,069
I love you, boys !

721
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:12,811
I love you, Will ! Love you, Luke !

722
00:40:26,994 --> 00:40:28,290
People of Nottingham !

723
00:40:35,295 --> 00:40:39,014
These men have committed no crime
worth more than a spell in the stocks.

724
00:40:44,995 --> 00:40:47,024
Will you tolerate this injustice ?

725
00:40:47,183 --> 00:40:49,484
I, for one, will not !

726
00:41:01,963 --> 00:41:02,986
This one !

727
00:41:03,935 --> 00:41:05,362
What the hell !

728
00:41:07,813 --> 00:41:10,611
You, Locksley, will say farewell to your little Mooch !

729
00:41:10,612 --> 00:41:13,062
His name is Much !

730
00:41:13,063 --> 00:41:14,762
Well it'll be Mooch in a moment.

731
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:35,174
Master, look out !

732
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:02,253
Robin !

733
00:42:02,254 --> 00:42:03,556
This way !

734
00:42:05,506 --> 00:42:07,572
You understand ! Now, get after him !

735
00:42:10,044 --> 00:42:11,302
Well let's return to Locksley.

736
00:42:12,835 --> 00:42:13,950
Dissent for good.

737
00:42:24,589 --> 00:42:25,377
Master !

738
00:42:25,884 --> 00:42:27,077
Archers ! what do we do ?

739
00:42:28,701 --> 00:42:30,288
Let's get them something to shoot at !

740
00:42:30,289 --> 00:42:31,157
Go, go, go !

741
00:43:05,278 --> 00:43:06,536
I'm just getting some pinion.

742
00:43:14,245 --> 00:43:15,109
Be honest with me.

743
00:43:17,081 --> 00:43:19,785
