1
00:00:00,322 --> 00:00:02,614
Before we wrap up,
I would like to thank you

2
00:00:02,882 --> 00:00:05,129
for filling out
these anonymous evaluation cards.

3
00:00:05,634 --> 00:00:08,163
I found your feedback
to be largely constructive

4
00:00:08,572 --> 00:00:10,134
and flattering, so <i>gracias</i>.

5
00:00:10,686 --> 00:00:12,471
- Don't sign your name anymore.
- Got it.

6
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:14,496
But there was one evaluation

7
00:00:15,032 --> 00:00:16,340
that was so harsh

8
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:18,517
and hurtful and racist

9
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:23,406
that I took the time personally
to analyze that handwriting

10
00:00:23,531 --> 00:00:24,774
against past exams.

11
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,556
And this particular coward

12
00:00:29,403 --> 00:00:31,263
dots her eyes

13
00:00:31,692 --> 00:00:34,325
with tiny, itty-bitty,
little circles.

14
00:00:38,198 --> 00:00:40,294
Isn't that precious and cute?

15
00:00:42,525 --> 00:00:45,810
Who's "erratic and unstable" now,
princess <i>gringa</i>?

16
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:53,696
- Nice day out today, isn't it?
- Shoot!

17
00:00:56,245 --> 00:00:57,795
You forget something?

18
00:00:58,147 --> 00:01:00,556
I forgot to stagger
the timing of my exit with Shirley's.

19
00:01:00,681 --> 00:01:02,098
We have a class
across campus,

20
00:01:02,223 --> 00:01:05,197
I can't go that kind of distance
with "That's nice".

21
00:01:05,322 --> 00:01:07,503
- That's mean.
- That's not nice.

22
00:01:07,688 --> 00:01:10,811
I find Shirley very easy to talk to,
and besides,

23
00:01:10,936 --> 00:01:14,211
aren't you supposed to have
an olympic gold medal in jibber-jabber?

24
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,760
But I'm a sprinter.

25
00:01:15,885 --> 00:01:18,267
I'm at my best
during high-speed bursts of wit.

26
00:01:18,392 --> 00:01:21,274
On a Shirley walk,
I'd be winded by that stoner tree.

27
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,918
- Vaughn, how's it going?
- No worries.

28
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,380
Interesting. I might be worried
if I played hackysack a decade too late.

29
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:31,571
My class is that way.

30
00:01:32,263 --> 00:01:34,984
But I just wanted to point out
we easily walked more than 100 yards

31
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:38,347
with no awkward pauses,
and that is the sign of a true friend.

32
00:01:38,927 --> 00:01:41,308
I'm really glad you're not hitting on me
anymore.

33
00:01:42,917 --> 00:01:44,548
There's the awkward pause.

34
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,610
Excuse me.
Sorry.

35
00:01:52,915 --> 00:01:54,655
- Professor Duncan!
- What?

36
00:01:55,913 --> 00:01:58,242
Annie Edison.
I'm in your 101 lecture.

37
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,626
- I heard about your special psych lab.
- The Duncan principle.

38
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:05,673
I know it's limited to 2-year students,
but I had a 4.0 at Riverside High,

39
00:02:05,798 --> 00:02:07,507
I'm not looking down
on this school,

40
00:02:07,632 --> 00:02:09,285
I'm here
cause of an addiction to pills

41
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,128
that I was told
would help me focus,

42
00:02:11,253 --> 00:02:13,808
they actually made me lose
my scholarship and virginity.

43
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:17,219
Letting me take your lab early would be
a feather in my transcript.

44
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,321
I've been in this situation many times,
so I'm just going to be up front.

45
00:02:21,446 --> 00:02:24,765
I'm not allowed to date students.
Even though you're an eight.

46
00:02:25,606 --> 00:02:27,772
Which is a British ten,
so I'm angry.

47
00:02:28,332 --> 00:02:31,275
But if you are still interested,
then you may join the lab.

48
00:02:33,481 --> 00:02:35,881
You need to bring
two human subjects.

49
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:40,113
It would not hurt your chances one bit
if you could lend me a fiver.

50
00:02:40,238 --> 00:02:43,913
Seem I have left my purse in my duffle
and my duffle in the boot of my lorry...

51
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:47,231
I asked politely, and then
panda took his pants off.

52
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,627
I never even knew
that's what asexual meant.

53
00:02:50,321 --> 00:02:52,569
I wonder
what this express package could be?

54
00:02:52,696 --> 00:02:54,715
Somebody had to get
something to me very fast.

55
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,509
You brought your mail to campus?

56
00:02:57,663 --> 00:02:59,637
- My ear-noculars.
- What is that?

57
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,685
- Looks like your bluetooth thingie.
- No.

58
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,474
This is my cell phone headset.

59
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,476
And this is

60
00:03:06,115 --> 00:03:07,353
ear-noculars.

61
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,397
It gives you sonic hearing.

62
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,109
- All hearing is sonic.
- What?

63
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:15,482
So who wants to be
in a psych experiment?

64
00:03:16,305 --> 00:03:19,232
Annie is talking
about some kind of experiment.

65
00:03:19,507 --> 00:03:21,242
She's behind you.
Not interested.

66
00:03:21,695 --> 00:03:23,202
Please?
You get paid.

67
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,745
They do stuff to your butt?

68
00:03:25,983 --> 00:03:28,707
Do you get paid more
if they do stuff to your butt?

69
00:03:29,072 --> 00:03:30,501
That's fine. I'm in.

70
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,884
- How about you? It's tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

71
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:37,675
They showing <i>Indiana Jones</i> at the vista.
I bought a whip.

72
00:03:38,871 --> 00:03:40,469
This is really important to me.

73
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,014
Could you please go as my friend?
My really good friend?

74
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,449
Didn't realize we were.

75
00:03:45,907 --> 00:03:49,763
Thought we were like Chandler and Phoebe
who never really had stories together.

76
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,314
- Sure, I'll do it, Chandler.
- Thank you.

77
00:03:54,007 --> 00:03:57,230
- I go save Britta from that dude.
- She looks like she's in trouble.

78
00:03:57,531 --> 00:03:59,864
Hope he doesn't try
to "handsome" her to death.

79
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,868
- Vaughn.
- You in line?

80
00:04:04,892 --> 00:04:06,287
We're just chillin'.

81
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,321
- You're not gonna order coffee?
- I was just gonna see if Britta...

82
00:04:09,446 --> 00:04:11,257
No judgment, bro.
I used to do coffee.

83
00:04:11,382 --> 00:04:13,405
Then I made the switch to green tea.

84
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,422
It's filled
with these antioxidants and stuff.

85
00:04:17,194 --> 00:04:19,194
- It's pretty tight.
- Tight.

86
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:21,882
- I've heard that about green tea.
- I like it.

87
00:04:22,007 --> 00:04:24,263
- I should make the change.
- Up top, sugar bear.

88
00:04:25,668 --> 00:04:27,932
Give me some of that.
Small coffee, please.

89
00:04:29,104 --> 00:04:31,103
Britta's making the change
to green tea.

90
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:35,733
Welcome, research assistants.

91
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,965
If you look at the monitor,

92
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,615
you'll see that our subjects are waiting
for the experiment to begin, but...

93
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,411
it's actually happening right now.

94
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,881
You see, the waiting is the experiment.
The Duncan principle is simple.

95
00:04:52,006 --> 00:04:55,516
Namely, that the more control lost by...
I'm gonna write this down too, actually.

96
00:04:55,641 --> 00:04:58,331
That's a good point.
The more control lost by the ego,

97
00:04:58,984 --> 00:05:01,370
the more gained by the id,

98
00:05:01,617 --> 00:05:03,799
resulting in a surprisingly
predictable

99
00:05:03,924 --> 00:05:05,719
emotional eruption

100
00:05:06,168 --> 00:05:08,832
or breaking point,
known to ma and pa

101
00:05:09,046 --> 00:05:11,023
as a good old-fashioned tantrum.

102
00:05:15,762 --> 00:05:19,902
Go and tell our subjects we gonna start
the experiment in five minutes.

103
00:05:25,394 --> 00:05:27,034
It's never actually going to start.

104
00:05:31,537 --> 00:05:32,539
Let's do this.

105
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,550
What, a community college
Spanish teacher can't use 80 bucks?

106
00:05:45,193 --> 00:05:49,390
We're just running a little bit behind,
so we'll start in about five minutes.

107
00:05:53,757 --> 00:05:55,445
It's unacceptable, all right?

108
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,692
You lied to me!

109
00:05:56,817 --> 00:05:59,858
When you say something starts at 9:00,
it starts at <i>nueve</i>!

110
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:09,191
Houston, we have an idiot.

111
00:06:21,443 --> 00:06:23,506
Did you know we walk
the same way after class?

112
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:25,881
Sure you didn't
or we would've been walking together,

113
00:06:26,006 --> 00:06:28,306
unless you're a jerk.
Just kidding.

114
00:06:28,859 --> 00:06:29,959
Let's do it.

115
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:33,007
Don't go too fast for these dogs.
Short legs.

116
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:41,443
- What's that?
- Nothing.

117
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,197
So Pierce isn't exactly
right in the head, is he?

118
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:51,618
I know a lot of men with radar dishes
coming out of their ears.

119
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,163
He's like Inspector Gadget.

120
00:06:54,632 --> 00:06:56,206
Go, go, Gadget incontinence.

121
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,333
How about the guy
flirting with Britta?

122
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,443
I know!
He's the worst! Vaughn?

123
00:07:00,568 --> 00:07:02,838
- What is it with his hair?
- It's perpetually moist.

124
00:07:03,308 --> 00:07:05,725
We're three hours in,
so let's review what we've seen.

125
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,886
And pay close attention
to every subject's breaking point.

126
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,054
We've got

127
00:07:10,753 --> 00:07:14,099
a shouter. That one's a stomper.
Bye, hippie.

128
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,884
There's a generic whack job, bouncing
up and down like a six-foot child.

129
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,565
Shaking. Write that down.
Visible shakes.

130
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,151
Look at the little one
chase the big one.

131
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,312
I gonna make him go quicker.
It's like Benny Hill looks.

132
00:07:27,437 --> 00:07:29,364
Get him.
Come back again. Get him.

133
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,284
All right? There's a bit of fun.
It lightens the mood.

134
00:07:32,826 --> 00:07:34,526
And back to the present.

135
00:07:35,443 --> 00:07:37,143
And then there were two.

136
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:40,501
Break.

137
00:07:53,628 --> 00:07:55,428
What is going on in there?

138
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:56,659
Why...?

139
00:07:56,803 --> 00:07:58,534
What is taking so long?

140
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:00,847
I've wasted all day

141
00:08:01,544 --> 00:08:03,704
here for you.

142
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,111
The soul train awards were tonight.

143
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:10,197
You promised butt stuff!

144
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,330
And he's out.
We got him.

145
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:20,249
Strike three.

146
00:08:20,492 --> 00:08:23,342
- You're gone.
- <i>There's so much dust in here.</i>

147
00:08:23,678 --> 00:08:27,256
Do you know what? The longer they wait,
the harder they break.

148
00:08:27,895 --> 00:08:29,216
Buckle up, students.

149
00:08:29,847 --> 00:08:32,067
Do you see how often
hacky sack takes his shirt off?

150
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:34,640
He'd play shirts and skins
in a game of checkers.

151
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:37,015
I'm so glad to be able to talk
to someone about this.

152
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:39,468
I wanted to say
something to Britta about it,

153
00:08:39,593 --> 00:08:42,103
but we're supposed to be friends,
she'd think I was jealous.

154
00:08:42,228 --> 00:08:44,022
I don't see why you aren't together.

155
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:46,775
Two cute white people
going to school together, seems right.

156
00:08:47,523 --> 00:08:49,278
We're not pandas in a zoo.

157
00:08:55,065 --> 00:08:56,817
That is not what I want to see.

158
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,333
There goes the shirt.

159
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,678
I'm fine.

160
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,691
Want me to...
check you for grass stains?

161
00:09:17,816 --> 00:09:21,237
I wasn't sure how or when to bring up
that I was hanging out with Vaughn.

162
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:24,104
I figured you'd make fun of him...
and me.

163
00:09:24,471 --> 00:09:27,573
First of all,
friends do not make fun of each other,

164
00:09:27,698 --> 00:09:30,194
even if they're being tackled
in the quad by a hippie,

165
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:32,471
and secondly, Vaughn

166
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,589
seems cool.

167
00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:36,783
You should hang out sometime.

168
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,240
I gotta go.

169
00:09:41,006 --> 00:09:42,756
That was tacky out there.

170
00:09:43,286 --> 00:09:45,102
You won't ever see that again.

171
00:09:45,946 --> 00:09:46,996
No worries.

172
00:09:55,452 --> 00:09:58,722
Did you see <i>señor</i> Chang's socks
today? Tiny bullfighters.

173
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:02,476
I can top that. Did you see
that hacky sack wears an anklet?

174
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,273
Since when won't you talk about him?

175
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,639
I'm trying to be
a good friend to Britta.

176
00:10:10,315 --> 00:10:13,528
She thought I was gonna make fun of him,
but I want to be unpredictable.

177
00:10:14,436 --> 00:10:18,226
I'm gonna show her
that I am not the jerk she thinks I am

178
00:10:19,013 --> 00:10:23,099
and friend the hell out
of that green-tea-drinking drum circler.

179
00:10:23,568 --> 00:10:26,600
- Tell me you noticed his small nipples.
- Not engaging.

180
00:10:26,725 --> 00:10:28,439
It's not gossip when it's fact.

181
00:10:28,564 --> 00:10:31,214
My kids have got hamsters
with bigger nips.

182
00:10:37,138 --> 00:10:38,388
Is it on pause?

183
00:10:40,177 --> 00:10:41,477
That's just him.

184
00:10:46,252 --> 00:10:49,279
Sorry you've been waiting 26 hours.

185
00:10:50,631 --> 00:10:53,110
- Just another five minutes.
- Okey-dokey.

186
00:10:56,028 --> 00:10:57,447
Why won't he leave?

187
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,037
- What?
- I'm sorry, but this guy's not moving.

188
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:02,869
I have classes to go to.

189
00:11:03,528 --> 00:11:04,496
Go! Fine!

190
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,103
Go kill John Lennon again,
you loser.

191
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:10,095
He's ruined my study!

192
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,754
He has warped the Duncan principle.

193
00:11:13,315 --> 00:11:16,153
Damn you,
you outlying piece of datum!

194
00:11:21,491 --> 00:11:23,815
It's you!
It's your fault!

195
00:11:24,566 --> 00:11:28,029
- But you told me to bring subjects.
- Subjects! Not rain man!

196
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:30,355
Should never have let you
into this lab,

197
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,649
Miss Annie fanny panties in a bunch!

198
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,724
That's so hilarious!

199
00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:38,553
Did you think of that last time
you skipped a trip to the dentist?

200
00:11:38,678 --> 00:11:41,658
Let me answer that question
with another question.

201
00:11:44,173 --> 00:11:45,373
It's not fair!

202
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,081
Why, why?

203
00:11:49,378 --> 00:11:51,043
What are you doing?
Stop writing!

204
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,670
Put your pen... Give me that!
Get out!

205
00:11:59,857 --> 00:12:02,971
You have destroyed
the Duncan principle!

206
00:12:09,797 --> 00:12:10,812
Go home!

207
00:12:14,906 --> 00:12:15,906
Cool.

208
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,616
You did a lot of community service.

209
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,786
Ultimate frisbee at the senior's center.
It is amazing.

210
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,054
And what makes frisbee ultimate?

211
00:12:28,903 --> 00:12:31,560
If I had a nickel for every time
I wished somebody asked me that.

212
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:34,735
- I'm gonna get dessert. Want anything?
- Carrots.

213
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,250
I'm good.

214
00:12:40,549 --> 00:12:42,719
- That's a cool shirt.
- Thank you.

215
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:45,098
- Thank you very much.
- Where's it from?

216
00:12:46,313 --> 00:12:48,142
I don't even know.
I guess it's...

217
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:53,064
- Look at that. "Hanes classic."
- That's nice.

218
00:12:53,318 --> 00:12:55,116
People underestimate the elderly,

219
00:12:55,343 --> 00:12:57,859
but you see these guys out there
and they're throwing the bee

220
00:12:58,537 --> 00:13:01,238
and they're just loving life.
It's just inspiring.

221
00:13:01,471 --> 00:13:03,990
You know, I'm gonna really...
I'm gonna think about it.

222
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:06,442
All right.
I'm gonna go check on Britts.

223
00:13:09,938 --> 00:13:11,813
- You are the devil.
- I know.

224
00:13:20,189 --> 00:13:22,302
Where do we go on Saturdays?
You said Sunday.

225
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,227
I have a question for you.

226
00:13:24,605 --> 00:13:26,255
You like Vaughn, right?

227
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:28,438
- He's very cute.
- I'm just worried

228
00:13:28,563 --> 00:13:31,844
he thinks a little bit more intensely
about this thing than I am.

229
00:13:32,513 --> 00:13:34,663
He says stuff, you know, after...

230
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:36,767
School?

231
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:38,981
- After...
- Dinner mints?

232
00:13:39,106 --> 00:13:41,194
- After...
- Not having sex?

233
00:13:43,901 --> 00:13:44,906
How was that?

234
00:13:45,174 --> 00:13:46,574
What? Forget that.

235
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:49,870
The problem right now is
that he's calling me "babe".

236
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:53,687
He's trying to hold my hand.
It's getting a little relationship-y.

237
00:13:54,021 --> 00:13:55,771
And he gave me something.

238
00:13:56,353 --> 00:13:58,153
- Herpes?
- No.

239
00:13:58,777 --> 00:13:59,777
This.

240
00:14:00,628 --> 00:14:03,310
- A poem?
- How do I respond to that?

241
00:14:03,435 --> 00:14:04,535
"Thank you"?

242
00:14:05,371 --> 00:14:07,053
It's a very good question.

243
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:08,810
And it's one I will answer.

244
00:14:09,657 --> 00:14:12,632
I'm getting a text.
I'm gonna read it, if you don't mind.

245
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:15,599
I am reading it,

246
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,772
and it is read.

247
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,478
"Did you ever notice
where the ocean meets the sky,

248
00:14:22,024 --> 00:14:23,024
"did ya?

249
00:14:23,376 --> 00:14:26,757
"It's the same wizard blue
that I see in your eye,

250
00:14:27,314 --> 00:14:28,314
"Brit-ta."

251
00:14:28,687 --> 00:14:29,887
"Wizard blue"?

252
00:14:31,118 --> 00:14:33,234
Thank you so much.
You just brightened my day.

253
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:35,251
I'm so glad we can rip
on that dude again.

254
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:36,377
Look at this.

255
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:39,602
That is the stain of a teardrop
over the word "rad".

256
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,563
He said "rad"?
I thought "bad."

257
00:14:41,688 --> 00:14:43,388
That makes it worse.

258
00:14:43,871 --> 00:14:46,821
- I'm surprised he can read. You know?
- I know.

259
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:51,440
Sorry about bailing
on the psych experiment.

260
00:14:51,565 --> 00:14:53,625
That was the experiment, Troy.

261
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,400
We were testing to see
how long people would wait in the room.

262
00:14:58,592 --> 00:15:00,192
- Gotcha.
- "Gotcha"?

263
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:03,012
- That's all you have to say?
- You sat in a room

264
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:05,362
for 26 straight hours.

265
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,405
- Didn't that bother you?
- I was livid.

266
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:10,492
- Why didn't you leave?
- You asked me to stay. We're friends.

267
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:20,187
- Is this still part of the experiment?
- More like a puppy with a fish mouth.

268
00:15:20,312 --> 00:15:22,162
Right. It's more like this.

269
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,440
Laugh it up.

270
00:15:26,246 --> 00:15:28,051
You want to know what they're doing?

271
00:15:28,606 --> 00:15:30,172
Making fun of all of us.

272
00:15:33,405 --> 00:15:35,892
I heard you
with my own ear... noculars.

273
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,061
We are not making fun of you.

274
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,929
Calling me "hacky sack"
and ripping...

275
00:15:41,214 --> 00:15:43,567
my six pack abs and my moist hair.

276
00:15:44,003 --> 00:15:45,653
And that face you made?

277
00:15:46,165 --> 00:15:48,280
I think it's pretty obviously Annie.

278
00:15:48,974 --> 00:15:50,657
Definitely part of the experiment.

279
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:52,993
We were not making fun of you.

280
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,270
We're making fun
of Britta's boyfriend.

281
00:15:56,681 --> 00:15:57,622
In that case.

282
00:15:57,965 --> 00:16:00,000
But if we do something,
let's do it as a team.

283
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,414
I'll get the ball rolling.
Maybe he has a tiny penis.

284
00:16:02,539 --> 00:16:04,575
- Who is he?
- You all have got to see him.

285
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,311
Everything's all, "No worries."

286
00:16:06,436 --> 00:16:08,502
And he always says hello
three times in a row.

287
00:16:08,627 --> 00:16:11,094
Hello, good evening, how are you?
And... here, look!

288
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,387
He wrote a poem!

289
00:16:13,705 --> 00:16:15,376
- Can I?
- We shouldn't show that.

290
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:17,553
- It's fine.
- So I'll be done in an hour.

291
00:16:17,678 --> 00:16:19,227
- No worries.
- He said it!

292
00:16:20,609 --> 00:16:21,938
You've met Vaughn, right?

293
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,446
This troop's
got a case of the giggles, huh?

294
00:16:35,323 --> 00:16:36,373
Is that...?

295
00:16:37,175 --> 00:16:39,606
Did you give them my poem?

296
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,560
Why is the dinosaur
rocking a picture of my poem?

297
00:16:42,685 --> 00:16:43,685
Read it.

298
00:16:48,421 --> 00:16:51,343
You guys are laughing at me,
aren't you?

299
00:16:58,524 --> 00:17:01,924
This is the least tight thing
that's ever happened to me.

300
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:06,571
I can't believe you.

301
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,693
Honestly, how dare you?

302
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:14,783
I can hear him outside.
He's crying.

303
00:17:17,248 --> 00:17:18,578
Now he's barking.

304
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,875
- Sorry I sold you out.
- Britta is never gonna forgive me.

305
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,644
I can't believe I showed you that poem.
My life is <i>Degrassi High</i>.

306
00:17:28,824 --> 00:17:30,524
I have a gossip problem.

307
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:32,676
I stir the pot, Jeff.
I'm a pot stirrer.

308
00:17:33,124 --> 00:17:35,595
This isn't even my only study group.
See those ladies?

309
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:40,067
I used to be in their group
till they kicked me out.

310
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:43,026
They call me "Tattle-ina".
It's a bumblebee nickname.

311
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:46,690
- It's cute, but it stings.
- Look at the size of those earrings.

312
00:17:47,173 --> 00:17:49,901
It's like little dogs
should be jumping through them.

313
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:52,696
This is never going to work.

314
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:55,407
- This has to end.
- Shirley, don't do this.

315
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,867
Look, we can still hang out.

316
00:17:57,998 --> 00:18:00,578
It's just, you know,
we won't bag on people.

317
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,623
What are we gonna talk about?
My kids? Your doctor career?

318
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,524
- I was a lawyer.
- See? I'm already bored.

319
00:18:11,201 --> 00:18:13,633
- We'll always have "tiny nipples".
- They were tiny.

320
00:18:16,736 --> 00:18:18,722
I shouldn't do this,
but one last gossip.

321
00:18:21,998 --> 00:18:25,353
Britta told me
she had a sex dream about you.

322
00:18:26,276 --> 00:18:27,976
You still have a chance.

323
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,483
Details.

324
00:18:37,498 --> 00:18:38,498
Abed, here.

325
00:18:40,172 --> 00:18:42,036
I wanted to say sorry
for yelling at you.

326
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,282
- <i>Indiana Jones</i>.
- I just got the first three cause...

327
00:18:48,407 --> 00:18:49,957
The fourth one blows.

328
00:18:52,061 --> 00:18:53,111
We're cool.

329
00:18:53,381 --> 00:18:56,309
- I do not want to talk to you.
- No, I know, and I'm sorry.

330
00:18:56,434 --> 00:18:58,983
I'm really sorry.
I'm really, really sorry,

331
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,598
- I go talk to him if you want.
- He broke up with me.

332
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,185
You broke my trust.
You suck.

333
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,854
I know, and I'm sorry,
but I was in a tough position.

334
00:19:08,301 --> 00:19:10,440
I couldn't handle
just being one of the girls.

335
00:19:14,267 --> 00:19:15,917
What do you want to be?

336
00:19:17,013 --> 00:19:19,663
Is there a spot on
the friendship spectrum

337
00:19:19,788 --> 00:19:23,578
between total stranger
and having to hear about who you date?

338
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:28,208
Just a notch underneath driving you
to the airport and paintin your kitchen?

339
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:31,256
How about the friend level
where you sometimes have to cat-sit?

340
00:19:31,677 --> 00:19:32,504
Done.

341
00:19:33,248 --> 00:19:36,090
And if I'm occasionally
naked in your dreams, I won't complain.

342
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,928
She's got a problem.
She stirs the pot. She's a pot stirrer.

343
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:43,309
Sorry, dudes.

344
00:19:43,732 --> 00:19:45,032
No worries, man.

345
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:47,106
Some worries, man.

346
00:19:47,879 --> 00:19:49,029
Some worries.

347
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:03,417
Shirley would have said
something funny about that guy.

348
00:20:04,664 --> 00:20:06,164
And so I told him...

349
00:20:11,655 --> 00:20:14,134
- Give me your ear-thing.
- Got rid of it.

350
00:20:17,313 --> 00:20:20,359
You see, Jeff, there are certain things
man was not meant to hear.

351
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:22,438
We were designed

352
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,722
by whatever entity you choose,

353
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,017
to hear what's in this range,

354
00:20:28,324 --> 00:20:30,019
and really, this range alone.

355
00:20:30,469 --> 00:20:32,897
Because you know
who's talking to us in this range?

356
00:20:34,138 --> 00:20:35,588
The people we love.

357
00:20:43,788 --> 00:20:46,117
He must have heard us
call him Inspector Gadget.

358
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:53,022
I think it's time for burning man.

359
00:20:53,817 --> 00:20:55,461
I'm Saddam Hussein.

360
00:20:56,076 --> 00:20:57,755
Nice to meet you, dude.

361
00:20:58,211 --> 00:21:00,851
I love reading
and being a desperate housewife.

362
00:21:00,976 --> 00:21:02,462
Hey, man, coming through.

363
00:21:02,587 --> 00:21:04,178
I love da <i>Desperate Housewives</i>.

364
00:21:06,173 --> 00:21:07,724
I'm Dr. Doogie seacrest.

365
00:21:08,336 --> 00:21:11,072
I think I'm better than everyone else
because I'm 40.

366
00:21:11,197 --> 00:21:12,056
I'm not 40.

367
00:21:13,685 --> 00:21:15,967
I can hear you
through the window, morons.

368
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,892
Just pretend like you're asleep.
