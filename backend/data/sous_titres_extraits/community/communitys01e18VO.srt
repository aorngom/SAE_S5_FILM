1
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,426
- Haven't seen you all day.
- I've been really busy.

2
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:08,515
I had to find 30 chairs for my class,
since it's family day.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,506
Speaking of, I was going to invite
my mom so you could meet her,

4
00:00:11,631 --> 00:00:13,823
but she still thinks I'm a lawyer.

5
00:00:13,948 --> 00:00:17,705
The human being has a little human
with it, how blood curdlingly adorable.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,310
We need to talk.

7
00:00:19,805 --> 00:00:21,833
What's wrong?
Are you breaking up with me?

8
00:00:22,693 --> 00:00:24,593
Maybe we don't need to talk.

9
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:28,152
I'm so excited for
everybody to meet my sons.

10
00:00:28,322 --> 00:00:29,987
Not twins, I hope.
They freak me out.

11
00:00:30,112 --> 00:00:32,039
- They know what the other...
- Is thinking?

12
00:00:32,164 --> 00:00:34,659
- They're finishing each other's...
- Pie.

13
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:36,744
It's gonna be nice
spending time with them.

14
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:38,996
I don't get to see them
since I started school.

15
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,558
My sister jokes that
they don't recognize me anymore,

16
00:00:41,683 --> 00:00:43,751
I joke that she's jealous
because she's barren.

17
00:00:45,051 --> 00:00:46,963
My dad brings my cousin Abra,
from Gaza.

18
00:00:47,324 --> 00:00:49,173
Does she look like you
in a wig and lipstick?

19
00:00:49,343 --> 00:00:52,033
That's Halle Berry.
Abra wears a full burka in public,

20
00:00:52,158 --> 00:00:54,499
she looks like someone
covered head to toe in black fabric.

21
00:00:54,624 --> 00:00:57,573
Can't believe my grandma's
rolling her old bones down here.

22
00:00:57,698 --> 00:00:59,308
I gotta pick a cabinet to hide in.

23
00:00:59,478 --> 00:01:01,769
- You hide from her?
- She's crazy.

24
00:01:03,436 --> 00:01:05,733
Society programs us
to dispose of the elderly

25
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:07,358
because they can't buy things,

26
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,930
but don't be blind to
your grandmother's value.

27
00:01:10,055 --> 00:01:11,362
You need to cherish her.

28
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,613
You cherish her.

29
00:01:12,783 --> 00:01:15,282
I'm sure I will.
She's not gonna be around forever.

30
00:01:15,452 --> 00:01:18,744
I wanna believe you're right,
but you never quite are, are you?

31
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,205
Sorry.

32
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:23,916
Was somebody canoodling
with a certain professor?

33
00:01:24,676 --> 00:01:26,919
Actually, no.
She dumped me.

34
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:31,340
That's so sad.
I'll give Jeff a shoulder to cry on,

35
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,051
and you go put a dead bird
in that bitch's glove compartment.

36
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:35,841
Guys, sit.

37
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,264
I don't need to cry, I'm fine.

38
00:01:38,997 --> 00:01:41,600
We're your friends.
Let it all out.

39
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,170
There's nothing to let out.

40
00:01:43,295 --> 00:01:45,281
I'm glad I didn't have
to do the dumping.

41
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:47,106
I'd have to lay low for three weeks

42
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,567
to look sensitive
and to avoid questions of overlap.

43
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,235
But as the dumpee...

44
00:01:51,877 --> 00:01:55,087
I can start making out with
every girl on campus right now.

45
00:01:55,212 --> 00:01:57,533
And all anyone will feel for me
is sorry.

46
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,161
- Not anymore.
- Your heart's desensitized.

47
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,290
Like a machine, it feels no love...
just sex, like the Bootynator.

48
00:02:06,086 --> 00:02:08,043
The Bootynator...
"I'll be back, but with Booty?"

49
00:02:08,213 --> 00:02:10,212
Why would the Bootynator be back
with Booty?

50
00:02:10,382 --> 00:02:11,822
Wouldn't he try and kill it?

51
00:02:11,947 --> 00:02:13,674
Maybe he brings it back as a trophy.

52
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,319
- Why would you want dead Booty?
- I want pirate's Booty.

53
00:02:16,444 --> 00:02:17,803
Because you're hungry?

54
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,623
I'll be back.

55
00:02:20,104 --> 00:02:21,474
But with Booty.

56
00:02:22,978 --> 00:02:25,026
- That's beneath you.
- Gross.

57
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:29,565
You're too gorgeous to be a teacher
and too happy

58
00:02:29,735 --> 00:02:31,033
to be a student.

59
00:02:31,571 --> 00:02:34,896
- Take me to where your car broke down.
- I'm here for family day.

60
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,072
I'm looking for my family.

61
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:40,547
I'm sure at the very least
I can fill in for a creepy uncle.

62
00:02:41,005 --> 00:02:41,882
Amber.

63
00:02:42,007 --> 00:02:44,038
There she is!
Look at you,

64
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:45,247
all grown up.

65
00:02:45,914 --> 00:02:47,416
This is my stepdaughter.

66
00:02:47,891 --> 00:02:50,217
- Small world.
- Actually, it's a very big world

67
00:02:50,342 --> 00:02:52,085
with five billion other women in it.

68
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,130
Good luck.

69
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:56,300
Come on, I'll show you around.

70
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:04,809
- I'm back.
- Without Booty.

71
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:06,591
Now I feel sorry for you.

72
00:03:07,314 --> 00:03:08,786
- Feygnasse Team -

73
00:03:09,157 --> 00:03:10,530
.:: La Fabrique ::.

74
00:03:12,417 --> 00:03:14,494
1x18: Basic Genealogy

75
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:22,284
- Hands in the air!
- Homeland security!

76
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:24,286
Boys, leave that man alone.

77
00:03:24,982 --> 00:03:27,489
- Orange alert!
- Sorry, they're just excited.

78
00:03:27,614 --> 00:03:29,724
You're Abed's father?
I'm Shirley.

79
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:31,625
That's Elijah, like the prophet,

80
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,963
and Jordan,
like the 14 time NBA all-star.

81
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,423
- Gubi Nadir.
- Is that how you say hello?

82
00:03:37,004 --> 00:03:38,300
That's my name.

83
00:03:39,995 --> 00:03:41,804
Sorry.
You're like a black ghost.

84
00:03:42,061 --> 00:03:43,556
This is my cousin. Abra.

85
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:44,849
Greetings.

86
00:03:46,895 --> 00:03:49,854
Over the course of 7 marriages,
I've amassed 32 stepchildren.

87
00:03:50,193 --> 00:03:52,246
And obviously, Amber's my favorite.

88
00:03:52,371 --> 00:03:55,024
There was something
about his mass emails

89
00:03:55,149 --> 00:03:57,742
that made me certain
this would be a family reunion.

90
00:03:58,586 --> 00:03:59,844
Sure is, sweetie.

91
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:02,741
- She's going to photography school.
- That sounds...

92
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,994
Keep it in your pants.
You're embarrassing yourself.

93
00:04:05,407 --> 00:04:07,594
She may be hot,
but she's my princess.

94
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,700
Step-princess.

95
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,585
Family day.

96
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,670
Let's see what we got here.

97
00:04:15,468 --> 00:04:18,757
I can't believe Star-burns
isn't a virgin.

98
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,472
But judging from
that bluetooth headset, his son is.

99
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:25,890
Too cool for family?

100
00:04:26,287 --> 00:04:28,068
Everyone here is my family.

101
00:04:28,859 --> 00:04:29,859
Weak.

102
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,477
Where's your family, el Tigre?

103
00:04:32,602 --> 00:04:34,840
My older brother
will be at the barbeque.

104
00:04:34,965 --> 00:04:38,527
And it's none of your business,
but I ate my twin in utero.

105
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,223
<i>Phantom menace,</i>
How's the trade embargo with the naboo?

106
00:04:43,348 --> 00:04:44,158
Anyway

107
00:04:45,316 --> 00:04:48,662
looks like Pierce broke the piggy bank
at the escort service this time.

108
00:04:48,832 --> 00:04:50,331
Duck sauce, that was rude.

109
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:54,933
The call girls I frequent are not
nearly as attractive as my daughter.

110
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:56,712
Stepdaughter.

111
00:04:57,556 --> 00:05:00,257
Technically ex-stepdaughter.

112
00:05:01,462 --> 00:05:04,707
- You know, your mother April...
- Her name's Wanda.

113
00:05:04,832 --> 00:05:06,111
Was it Wanda? Yes.

114
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:08,176
Hold on one second.
Excuse me.

115
00:05:10,932 --> 00:05:12,394
The cards are on the table.

116
00:05:12,794 --> 00:05:15,149
Amber's the best shot
I'll ever have...

117
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,859
at something like a real daughter
and I'm striking out.

118
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:21,111
Have you told her
she's prettier than a hooker?

119
00:05:21,236 --> 00:05:24,949
If you come to the barbeque...
You'd never think of touching her...

120
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,577
Maybe you could say a couple
of cool things about me.

121
00:05:28,968 --> 00:05:32,248
You want me to wingman you
with your ex-stepdaughter?

122
00:05:32,568 --> 00:05:34,668
I'm sorry. I got a thing.

123
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:39,619
- You have a thing?
- And it's on the rebound.

124
00:05:39,744 --> 00:05:42,049
I not subject it to a night
with a girl that I can't have.

125
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,968
You can't holster it for a friend?

126
00:05:44,425 --> 00:05:46,174
Pierce is barely a friend.

127
00:05:46,299 --> 00:05:48,209
He's no more related
to Amber than you,

128
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:50,140
and he was a jag
about shutting me down.

129
00:05:50,426 --> 00:05:52,434
- How much effort do I rate?
- For you?

130
00:05:54,068 --> 00:05:55,604
I'd break a light sweat.

131
00:05:55,992 --> 00:05:58,983
Good, I need a favor.
Help Pierce with his stepdaughter?

132
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,440
You're becoming dangerous.

133
00:06:01,972 --> 00:06:03,219
It's those doe eyes.

134
00:06:03,344 --> 00:06:06,615
Disappointing you is like choking
the little mermaid with a bike chain.

135
00:06:10,372 --> 00:06:12,405
Is this nana Barnes?

136
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,957
Troy didn't mention
you were such a knockout.

137
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,028
What's that supposed to mean?

138
00:06:17,153 --> 00:06:19,545
I'm sure you've broken
a few hearts in your time.

139
00:06:21,156 --> 00:06:24,675
Tell me, how many men
do you think I've laid with?

140
00:06:26,936 --> 00:06:28,908
- Who are you?
- I am Britta.

141
00:06:29,545 --> 00:06:31,042
And I have offended you.

142
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,600
And I am sorry.
Is there anything I can get you?

143
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,771
- You can get me a switch.
- A what now?

144
00:06:38,683 --> 00:06:41,275
She's not family, nana.
You can't make her get you a switch.

145
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:44,820
She can make me get it,
I just have to know what it is.

146
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,114
It's a stick she can use
to whup you with.

147
00:06:50,758 --> 00:06:53,287
Cherish, Britta. Cherish.

148
00:06:54,517 --> 00:06:57,003
It was wonderful
meeting your brother.

149
00:06:57,128 --> 00:07:00,034
Adios, Señor Chang.
Shalom, Rabbi Chang.

150
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:01,837
And to both of you, sayonara.

151
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,506
- Right?
- Don't go.

152
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,995
Ben, do you realize how
ridiculous that sounds?

153
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,307
That is who I am.
So drop it!

154
00:07:13,692 --> 00:07:15,129
I'm dropping.

155
00:07:17,044 --> 00:07:19,522
Amber alert,
you are allergic to peanuts.

156
00:07:19,844 --> 00:07:23,359
That might be a different stepkid.
My flight actually leaves, so...

157
00:07:23,653 --> 00:07:26,695
Your flight actually leaves
after I tell you

158
00:07:26,865 --> 00:07:30,240
a story called
"Pierce takes on the school bully".

159
00:07:33,508 --> 00:07:35,579
- Are you a ninja?
- Baby.

160
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:37,746
- Don't be rude.
- She's wearing a burka.

161
00:07:37,871 --> 00:07:41,001
It's a way for women to express
their modesty, like islamic turtlenecks.

162
00:07:41,426 --> 00:07:43,429
Ask her if she wants
to play with us.

163
00:07:50,934 --> 00:07:51,970
... bouncy house.

164
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:59,074
That sounds heated.

165
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,438
Did she call him a pig's anus
or something?

166
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,817
She's saying she's old enough
to jump in a giant balloon.

167
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:08,403
She's saying he's overprotective.

168
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:14,410
- Now she says he's a pig anus.
- That fight made me crave a hot dog.

169
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,745
Stay put, boys. I'll be back.

170
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,253
You are a bad mother.
Control your children.

171
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,220
I have to go back to my car
and get my emergency shirt.

172
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:30,259
And I don't like that shirt!

173
00:08:31,943 --> 00:08:34,763
Not only did he join a band,
They got jealous and booted him.

174
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:35,931
Get out!

175
00:08:36,613 --> 00:08:38,429
That's exactly what they said.

176
00:08:38,706 --> 00:08:41,057
Off to the bathroom. Stepdad.

177
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,649
- I've never been called "stepdad."
- I don't think anyone has.

178
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,731
Listen, when she gets back...

179
00:08:47,856 --> 00:08:49,651
find some reason
why you have to leave.

180
00:08:49,776 --> 00:08:51,484
I'll beg you to stay, but you don't.

181
00:08:51,609 --> 00:08:53,907
Why don't you just leave now
and cut our work in half?

182
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,641
Good luck, buddy.

183
00:09:03,904 --> 00:09:05,154
You're leaving.

184
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:09,465
- My girlfriend... is pregnant.
- Pierce said you were gay.

185
00:09:11,096 --> 00:09:13,010
Yep, as the sunrise.

186
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,344
I'm deeply ashamed.

187
00:09:14,738 --> 00:09:17,538
I'm glad I have friends
like Pierce to keep...

188
00:09:20,647 --> 00:09:21,709
Honest.

189
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:28,358
This is slightly wrong.

190
00:09:28,725 --> 00:09:30,485
- Too much tongue?
- Just enough.

191
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,003
But it's Pierce.

192
00:09:32,128 --> 00:09:35,372
You mean the guy who doesn't want
men touching his ex-stepdaughter,

193
00:09:35,497 --> 00:09:37,451
but divorced my mom
for our housekeeper?

194
00:09:37,816 --> 00:09:39,399
Could be the same guy.

195
00:09:41,496 --> 00:09:42,498
There you are.

196
00:09:44,302 --> 00:09:46,418
- Why are you here?
- I go to school here, remember?

197
00:09:47,807 --> 00:09:50,672
There's a pictionary tournament
in the student lounge.

198
00:09:50,842 --> 00:09:52,424
Sounds fun!
Is Jeff joining us?

199
00:09:52,964 --> 00:09:55,219
- I don't know if he can.
- I can't.

200
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:56,678
- Come on.
- Stay.

201
00:09:56,848 --> 00:09:59,056
- I can't.
- Maybe I shouldn't either.

202
00:10:01,349 --> 00:10:02,935
- Stay.
- Do you think I should?

203
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,770
- I think you have to.
- I stay.

204
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,434
- Me too.
- Good, family day.

205
00:10:14,973 --> 00:10:16,027
Whatcha doin'?

206
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:18,078
Getting nana a switch.

207
00:10:19,672 --> 00:10:21,805
Stop pretending
that my mean old nana is awesome.

208
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,164
I'm not pretending.

209
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,113
I think it's cool that she's got
her own style of discipline.

210
00:10:26,238 --> 00:10:27,590
Nana's old school.

211
00:10:27,812 --> 00:10:30,437
Yeah, my mom told me
there'd be white people that did this.

212
00:10:30,801 --> 00:10:32,881
With pocket watches,
and coffee grinders,

213
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,844
and pretending
to be into steam boats.

214
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:36,930
But let's get this straight.

215
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,625
This is real life.

216
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:40,582
My nana's gonna whup you.

217
00:10:40,993 --> 00:10:43,208
Not unless I find her a switch.

218
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,458
How about this?

219
00:10:48,962 --> 00:10:50,802
Yeah, that's a great switch, Britta.

220
00:10:51,024 --> 00:10:52,943
Very hip. It should hurt a lot.

221
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,820
Where's Elijah and Jordan?

222
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:57,239
What a surprise that you lost them.

223
00:10:57,528 --> 00:10:59,199
- They're playing hide'n'seek.
- Where?

224
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:01,785
- That's not how it works.
- Stop screwing.

225
00:11:02,451 --> 00:11:04,045
You want to yell at someone?

226
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,564
Go find your crazy kids.
My boy's disciplined.

227
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:08,509
- It's not his job to...
- All right!

228
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,836
You got me, Gubi.
I'm a bad mother.

229
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:14,464
At least I let my kids be kids,
instead of acting like a jail warden.

230
00:11:14,634 --> 00:11:15,799
You don't like a burka.

231
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,515
I'm not talking about the burka.

232
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,882
I'm talking about her
never having any fun.

233
00:11:20,007 --> 00:11:22,639
Now Abra, you look me in the eyes,
and you tell me...

234
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:27,448
I'm sorry.

235
00:11:27,573 --> 00:11:30,188
I seem to have forgotten the napkins.
Do you mind?

236
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,510
Fine.

237
00:11:32,023 --> 00:11:33,275
Now I'm the napkin man.

238
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:50,331
Circle.

239
00:11:52,714 --> 00:11:55,505
Circle with a squiggly line.
A squiggly line circle.

240
00:11:55,675 --> 00:11:56,965
You heard me say "circle"?

241
00:11:59,083 --> 00:11:59,985
Smiling...

242
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,136
sideways vagina.

243
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,639
Happy...
sideways vagina.

244
00:12:05,617 --> 00:12:06,475
Happy face.

245
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:08,727
And that's a clam?

246
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:10,926
- "As happy as a clam."
- Yes!

247
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,743
"As happy as a clam"? What a...

248
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:14,608
gay guess. Idiot.

249
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,193
Pierce, you're up.

250
00:12:17,348 --> 00:12:20,614
- Eat my dust, Winger.
- You do know we're on the same team?

251
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:27,829
All right, here we go...

252
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,378
Look, I don't.

253
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,983
You have to add more.
You have to draw more.

254
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:44,805
Stop circling the same thing.

255
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,807
Guess what, you girlfriendless geek!

256
00:12:48,151 --> 00:12:51,311
- What are you drawing?
- You're supposed to know, stupid.

257
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,499
Relax...

258
00:12:53,763 --> 00:12:54,806
I'll get this.

259
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:01,017
I think they'll both drop charges,
we gotta take statements.

260
00:13:01,142 --> 00:13:02,406
It's gonna be a while.

261
00:13:02,669 --> 00:13:05,399
And I may just be a simple cop,
but people need to know.

262
00:13:05,856 --> 00:13:09,246
This isn't gonna stop until pictionary
bans the word "windmill".

263
00:13:09,729 --> 00:13:12,791
Pierce. We'll meet you at the gala.
We're gonna go get some coffee.

264
00:13:13,151 --> 00:13:14,543
Is "coffee" code for sex?

265
00:13:16,854 --> 00:13:17,671
Is it?

266
00:13:21,729 --> 00:13:23,844
- Here's your switch.
- Bring it here.

267
00:13:27,577 --> 00:13:28,640
I'll make do.

268
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,767
Let me have it.

269
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:32,853
I ain't no nun!
Bend over.

270
00:13:36,284 --> 00:13:38,775
Drop your pants and get over my lap.

271
00:13:39,484 --> 00:13:41,361
All you have to do is walk away.

272
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,169
What you doing?

273
00:13:57,447 --> 00:13:59,337
She's respecting her elders.

274
00:13:59,507 --> 00:14:01,432
See,
did you think I was a hypocrite?

275
00:14:01,557 --> 00:14:04,033
That I wouldn't really...
okay, that really...

276
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,073
I don't understand you, Britta.

277
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:13,932
I don't understand you at all.

278
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,808
You know what?

279
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:20,859
Totally wrong room.
Will you get the door?

280
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,279
She's had enough!

281
00:14:25,146 --> 00:14:26,448
She's had enough!

282
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,349
Let's focus on you,

283
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:36,599
the forbidden fruit
that is the ex-stepdaughter

284
00:14:36,724 --> 00:14:38,568
of a casual acquaintance.

285
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,384
Don't wanna lose that.

286
00:14:41,931 --> 00:14:44,382
Why do you have
a $25,000 check from Pierce?

287
00:14:45,048 --> 00:14:48,386
- Tuition, for fashion school.
- Not photography school?

288
00:14:50,638 --> 00:14:51,915
You caught me.

289
00:14:52,911 --> 00:14:54,434
Maybe I'll just buy a car.

290
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,228
You just do that?

291
00:14:56,532 --> 00:14:59,263
Well, it helps that he's kind
of desperate and stupid.

292
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,859
Did you wanna be a good person?
Or did you wanna be with me?

293
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,279


294
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,228
There you are.

295
00:15:09,353 --> 00:15:10,678
Thanks a lot, Pollyanna.

296
00:15:10,803 --> 00:15:12,897
You made me hang out
with Pierce and his stepdaughter.

297
00:15:13,022 --> 00:15:14,311
She's grifting him.

298
00:15:14,436 --> 00:15:15,351
She's what?

299
00:15:15,476 --> 00:15:18,792
She's taking a bunch of money from him.
He give's for school, but it's for...

300
00:15:19,173 --> 00:15:20,157
grifting.

301
00:15:20,403 --> 00:15:21,657
Did you tell him?

302
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:23,505
It's not simple.

303
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:24,881
It's not?

304
00:15:28,696 --> 00:15:29,575
Gross!

305
00:15:29,985 --> 00:15:31,012
You're gross!

306
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,097
You did it?

307
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,808
Yeah, but not twice.
I wanted to do it twice.

308
00:15:35,094 --> 00:15:37,352
That's gross!
You met her this morning,

309
00:15:37,522 --> 00:15:40,309
You're faster than some bacteria.

310
00:15:40,965 --> 00:15:42,857
Are you doing this
cause Slater hurt you?

311
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:43,974
What? No,

312
00:15:44,099 --> 00:15:46,194
I'm not hurt.
And Amber threw herself at me.

313
00:15:46,364 --> 00:15:49,698
You still have to tell Pierce she's
taking advantage of him, don't you?

314
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,842
When you think about it,
nobody's getting hurt.

315
00:15:54,101 --> 00:15:56,215
Pierce's getting a daughter,
Amber's getting allowance,

316
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,250
I'm getting...
we already talked about it.

317
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,916
Don't forget, this is Pierce.

318
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:03,670
He's a racist, homophobic, old goof.
He does bad stuff all the time.

319
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:08,466
Sounds like you've got all figured out.
So why you talking to me about it?

320
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:10,960
Because...

321
00:16:11,207 --> 00:16:12,012
you're...

322
00:16:12,836 --> 00:16:13,820
you know...

323
00:16:14,054 --> 00:16:15,682
- A decent person?
- Maybe.

324
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,674
You knew that talking to me
would make you feel like a bad friend?

325
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,022
You wanted to feel like a bad friend,
because you wanna be a good friend?

326
00:16:22,764 --> 00:16:24,616
You really suck, you know that?

327
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:32,616
Go get you and your brother
some ding dongs and calm down.

328
00:16:33,485 --> 00:16:34,285
'sup?

329
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:36,757
- Did your family take off?
- Yeah.

330
00:16:36,882 --> 00:16:39,247
Thanks for distracting him
while we helped Abra and her burka.

331
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:42,028
If a young lady wants to go in
the bouncy house, she should go.

332
00:16:42,153 --> 00:16:43,335
You did a noble thing.

333
00:16:43,974 --> 00:16:46,504
I didn't do it.
No, it was Jordan and Elijah's idea.

334
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:49,567
They're good kids. If they weren't,
they wouldn't be able to help Abra.

335
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:51,259
I see why you were excited.

336
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,638
You should be proud of them.
You're a good mom.

337
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,014
Oh, come on.

338
00:16:57,894 --> 00:16:59,392
Mom.
Look what I got.

339
00:17:02,101 --> 00:17:03,480
Ding dongs are my favorite.

340
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:08,401
Pretty rough?

341
00:17:08,571 --> 00:17:10,612
You were right.
Nana's a monster.

342
00:17:11,168 --> 00:17:12,280
What did you say?

343
00:17:12,785 --> 00:17:14,532
I said you were a monster, Ma'am.

344
00:17:14,906 --> 00:17:16,660
And you said Troy was right.

345
00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:19,871
Get me a switch.

346
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,671
Hey, stranger.

347
00:17:28,294 --> 00:17:29,811
Wanna pick up where we left off

348
00:17:29,936 --> 00:17:32,050
after I log some time
with daddy warbucks?

349
00:17:34,704 --> 00:17:37,692
I thought about it. And what I want
is for you to tear up that check,

350
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:39,349
and go dance with your stepdad.

351
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:43,478
Are you trying to get me to cut you in?
You don't have leverage.

352
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:45,146
If I walk over there

353
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,899
and tell him everything,
guess who he'll forgive.

354
00:17:48,069 --> 00:17:48,888
You.

355
00:17:49,013 --> 00:17:51,361
But I'd rather be the bad guy
than watch you siphon him.

356
00:17:51,642 --> 00:17:52,638
How about this?

357
00:17:52,763 --> 00:17:55,380
I walk away, and if the check clears

358
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,951
I won't make problems for you.
I'll stay gone.

359
00:17:58,434 --> 00:17:59,922
Come back whenever you want.

360
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,914
But be good to him when you do,
because I'll be around.

361
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:04,458
And I'm his friend.

362
00:18:05,102 --> 00:18:06,708
And you can be his stepdaughter...

363
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:07,669
or not.

364
00:18:12,077 --> 00:18:13,600
I'll take the 25 grand.

365
00:18:13,928 --> 00:18:15,205
Over him,

366
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,470
I'd take 25 cents.

367
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:26,871
Have you seen Amber?

368
00:18:27,712 --> 00:18:30,191
Listen, Pierce,
I gotta tell you something.

369
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:31,802
She's not coming, is she?

370
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:33,946
I wrote her a pretty big check
this afternoon.

371
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,501
I had a feeling she might...

372
00:18:35,626 --> 00:18:36,740
take it and run.

373
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:39,117
- You want me to help you cancel?
- She earned it.

374
00:18:40,821 --> 00:18:42,848
You're lucky.
It's not too late for you.

375
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,330
Have a family,

376
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:46,398
share your life.

377
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,328
That and understanding computers
are two things

378
00:18:49,453 --> 00:18:51,671
you just can't knock out at the end.

379
00:18:54,297 --> 00:18:56,676
Who did you call last week
after you farted on Vaughn?

380
00:18:57,004 --> 00:18:57,804
You.

381
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:00,513
And who did Abed call
after that squirrel stole his hot dog?

382
00:19:00,945 --> 00:19:02,926
- Me.
- That's sharing your life.

383
00:19:03,465 --> 00:19:05,518
If you have friends,
you have family.

384
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,300
Come here, son.

385
00:19:22,102 --> 00:19:23,870
Are we hugging or dancing?

386
00:19:24,305 --> 00:19:25,723
If the roles were reversed,

387
00:19:25,848 --> 00:19:27,832
I would've had sex
with your ex-stepdaughter.

388
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,000
I did.

389
00:19:32,407 --> 00:19:34,036
Chip off the old block.

390
00:19:34,692 --> 00:19:36,925
It was either that
or deal with your actual pain.

391
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:37,967
What pain?

392
00:19:39,228 --> 00:19:40,083
12:00.

393
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:42,639
Are you kidding me?

394
00:19:49,367 --> 00:19:50,878
It's okay, it's okay.

395
00:19:53,082 --> 00:19:54,007
Let it out,

396
00:19:54,254 --> 00:19:57,617
We always used to watch the shows
she wanted to watch.

397
00:19:58,871 --> 00:19:59,781
I hate <i>Glee</i>.

398
00:20:00,488 --> 00:20:02,158
I'm not crazy about <i>Glee</i> either.

399
00:20:02,421 --> 00:20:03,359
I hate it.

400
00:20:04,402 --> 00:20:06,621
I don't understand
the appeal at all.

401
00:20:09,981 --> 00:20:12,559
- Why did we do this again?
- We thought it looked fun.

402
00:20:12,887 --> 00:20:15,090
- Is your phone in your pocket?
- I can't reach it.

403
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:16,825
I can only move my right arm.

404
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:19,828
there's money already there.
Slide your arm through that bottom,

405
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:21,387
and press the buttons g-14.

406
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,682
When the snack is selected,
the mechanical lever

407
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:27,071
will be thrust forward, thereby knocking
your phone out into the receptacle,

408
00:20:27,196 --> 00:20:29,732
- you can pick it up and call for help.
- Here we go.

409
00:20:39,347 --> 00:20:40,823
I think I hit g-13.
