2
00:00:01,732 --> 00:00:04,587
His name is Jesse, and you don't know
the first thing about him.

3
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:06,505
You're going back to rehab.
Today.

4
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,552
I have a daughter.
You can't give up on them.

5
00:00:14,006 --> 00:00:15,264
I loved her.

6
00:00:15,637 --> 00:00:17,845
201.6.

7
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:21,062
- Better over than under.
- What are we, running a charity?

8
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:24,732
Maybe I know a whole new market.
Maybe alls we need is the meth.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,652
- The yield. Come on.
- 201.8.

<i>Hush little baby, don't say a word</i>

11
00:00:34,157 --> 00:00:36,661
<i>Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird</i>

12
00:00:37,732 --> 00:00:40,537
<i>And if that mockingbird won't sing</i>

13
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,959
<i>Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring</i>

14
00:00:45,033 --> 00:00:48,005

<i>Mama's gonna buy you...</i>

21
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:33,715
Surprised he doesn't make
us do that.

22
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:39,296
The pack totally
has a pecking order.

23
00:02:39,746 --> 00:02:42,554
And the head Hyena, he's the man.

24
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,768
All the other ones have to,
like, kiss his ass.

25
00:02:46,137 --> 00:02:48,573
I mean, literally.
It's so gross.

26
00:02:48,698 --> 00:02:51,773
They have to lick his jerk.

27
00:02:51,898 --> 00:02:54,848
I can't believe
they even showed it on TV.

28
00:02:59,672 --> 00:03:01,663
If this is supposed to be all, like,

29
00:03:01,788 --> 00:03:03,379
Major League and all,

30
00:03:03,702 --> 00:03:07,282
we should have equipment
maintainer guys.

31
00:03:10,674 --> 00:03:13,043
And water boys.
You know?

32
00:03:16,064 --> 00:03:17,696
Gatorade me, bitch.

33
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,534
Get us a couple flunkies in here.

34
00:03:22,276 --> 00:03:23,519
Treat us right.

35
00:03:34,883 --> 00:03:37,796
15 hours starts now.

36
00:03:38,592 --> 00:03:41,071
I'm going to hit it,
if that's cool with you.

37
00:03:41,196 --> 00:03:42,513
I don't understand.

38
00:03:43,034 --> 00:03:43,822
What?

39
00:03:43,947 --> 00:03:45,922
These numbers,
they just don't add up.

40
00:03:46,118 --> 00:03:48,118
Told you.
Dude's totally boning us.

41
00:03:48,711 --> 00:03:50,332
No, it's not that.

42
00:03:51,546 --> 00:03:53,061
It's our output.
We're off.

43
00:03:53,186 --> 00:03:56,068
We're .14% off.

44
00:03:56,578 --> 00:03:58,178
Point one-four, that's

45
00:03:59,192 --> 00:04:00,582
what, like...

46
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,050
What does that mean?

47
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,570
It means we should be netting
more than we're netting.

48
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:09,975
So how far off are we?

49
00:04:11,312 --> 00:04:12,812
It's not negligible.

50
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:17,009
Ball-parking it, I'd say we're

51
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,220
quarter to a half a pound shy.

52
00:04:21,874 --> 00:04:23,271
That's weird.

53
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,056
What about spillage?

54
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,392
Spillage?

55
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,686
Yeah, you know, like,
just stuff gets spilled.

56
00:04:31,285 --> 00:04:32,640
Nothing gets spilled.

57
00:04:33,183 --> 00:04:34,231
A little maybe.

58
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,025
Nothing gets spilled.

59
00:04:36,846 --> 00:04:38,485
What about evaporation?

60
00:04:39,382 --> 00:04:40,884
It wouldn't account for this much.

61
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:42,950
The materials aren't out that long.

62
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,818
What about the other one?

63
00:04:45,246 --> 00:04:47,321
The drops, like on...

64
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,057
on that, like, cold beer.

65
00:04:50,587 --> 00:04:51,540
Condensation?

66
00:04:55,988 --> 00:04:58,527
What about the crap
that gets left behind,

67
00:04:59,225 --> 00:05:01,591
you know, all the gunk
we scrape out of the vats?

68
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:05,179
I add up, like, a gallon each.

69
00:05:05,869 --> 00:05:07,259
Did you work that in?

70
00:05:08,393 --> 00:05:09,393
Vestiges?

71
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:12,141
Vestiges.

72
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,503
Bet that's it.

73
00:05:18,038 --> 00:05:19,638
Bet that's totally it.

74
00:05:30,715 --> 00:05:31,865
Are you okay?

75
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:34,649
Why?

76
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,079
Nothing.

77
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,767
Are you coming?

78
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:54,101
Yeah, in a minute.

79
00:05:56,403 --> 00:05:58,303
All right, see you tomorrow.

80
00:07:00,172 --> 00:07:01,172
All right.

81
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:08,608
Shit.

82
00:07:11,657 --> 00:07:12,776
You bastard.

83
00:07:23,904 --> 00:07:24,904
Son of a...

84
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:41,225
Come on, you...

85
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:43,462
Come on, come on.

86
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,620
Son of a...

87
00:08:17,341 --> 00:08:18,505
Son of a bitch.

88
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:36,931
That's great.

89
00:09:05,527 --> 00:09:06,527
All right.

90
00:09:29,198 --> 00:09:30,490
You little bastard.

91
00:11:12,168 --> 00:11:13,326
Shut the door!

92
00:11:13,451 --> 00:11:14,881
My ears are popping.

93
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,902
Shut the door.
Move.

94
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:20,420
It's like I'm on an airplane.
What the hell's doing that?

95
00:11:20,545 --> 00:11:21,709
Positive pressure.

96
00:11:23,094 --> 00:11:24,144
Positive what?

97
00:11:24,865 --> 00:11:26,194
God, friggin' kills.

98
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,132
Just move your jaw around.
Move it around.

99
00:11:28,257 --> 00:11:30,189
I am moving it around.
It's not working.

100
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,599
Then just yawn or something.
Stop acting like such a baby.

101
00:11:33,977 --> 00:11:34,977
Damn.

102
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,894
What positive?
Positive what?

103
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:40,452
Pressure. I've turned
the ventilation up

104
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,547
to keep the outside out.

105
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,277
There's been a contamination.

106
00:11:47,103 --> 00:11:48,060
Wait.

107
00:11:48,185 --> 00:11:49,082
What?

108
00:11:50,781 --> 00:11:53,402
- Hold up.
- Something got into the lab.

109
00:11:53,828 --> 00:11:55,778
So what do we do?

110
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,675
I mean, do we...

111
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,404
Wait. Wait. I mean, shouldn't
we be wearing masks?

112
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,963
It's not that...
that kind of contaminant.

113
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,491
So it's, like, not dangerous?

114
00:12:07,377 --> 00:12:09,277
Mr. White, talk to me here.

115
00:12:11,138 --> 00:12:13,580
Not to us particularly. No.

116
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:17,069
What is that?

117
00:12:17,906 --> 00:12:18,906
This is...

118
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:21,366
I made it.

119
00:12:23,703 --> 00:12:27,412
So exactly what kind of contaminant
are we dealing with here?

120
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,851
A fly.

121
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:37,889
What do you mean?

122
00:12:38,435 --> 00:12:39,383
A fly, like...

123
00:12:40,136 --> 00:12:42,156
- like what do you mean?
- I mean

124
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:43,034
a fly,

125
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,145
a house fly.

126
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:49,184
Like, uh, one fly?

127
00:12:50,093 --> 00:12:50,977
Singular?

128
00:12:52,533 --> 00:12:54,330
- What did it do?
- It got into the lab,

129
00:12:54,455 --> 00:12:56,722
and I'm trying to get it out.
Okay? Understand?

130
00:12:57,357 --> 00:12:59,425
No, man, not really.

131
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,008
I can't say that I'm
really following you here.

132
00:13:03,928 --> 00:13:06,493
Dude, you scared the shit out of me.

133
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,703
I mean, when you say
it's contamination,

134
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,851
I mean, I'm thinking, like
an Ebola leak or something.

135
00:13:11,976 --> 00:13:12,801
Ebola?

136
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:15,553
Yeah, it's a disease
on The Discovery Channel,

137
00:13:15,678 --> 00:13:18,655
where all your intestines sort of
just slip right out of your butt.

138
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,814
Thank you. I know wt Ebola is.

139
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,897
Now, tell me.
What would a West-African virus

140
00:13:24,022 --> 00:13:25,324
be doing in our lab?

141
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:27,514
So,

142
00:13:27,816 --> 00:13:29,796
you're chasing around a fly,

143
00:13:30,054 --> 00:13:32,985
and in your world I'm the idiot.

144
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,139
Jesse, listen.

145
00:13:37,762 --> 00:13:39,821
This fly... any fly...

146
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:41,841
cannot be in our lab.

147
00:13:41,966 --> 00:13:44,210
It's a problem.
It's a contamination,

148
00:13:44,335 --> 00:13:46,919
and that is in no way
a misuse of the word.

149
00:13:47,331 --> 00:13:48,000
Okay?

150
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,763
So in terms of

151
00:13:50,147 --> 00:13:51,878
keeping our cook clean

152
00:13:52,151 --> 00:13:53,976
and our product unadulterated,

153
00:13:54,202 --> 00:13:55,752
we need to take this
very seriously.

154
00:13:56,689 --> 00:13:58,044
Now do you understand?

155
00:14:01,843 --> 00:14:03,341
So is that your fly saber?

156
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:07,693
This is a swatter.

157
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,425
It happens to work quite well,
thank you.

158
00:14:12,054 --> 00:14:13,641
What happened to your head?

159
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,566
Nothing. I'm fine.

160
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:17,324
You didn't hit it,

161
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:18,871
like really... really hard?

162
00:14:18,996 --> 00:14:20,715
My head is not the problem, Jesse.

163
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,490
The fly is the problem.

164
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:26,067
You didn't happen to

165
00:14:26,573 --> 00:14:27,573
maybe...

166
00:14:28,126 --> 00:14:30,237
try our product, did you?

167
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,573
Jesse, I know this

168
00:14:32,698 --> 00:14:34,581
seems unusual to you, a layman.

169
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,335
A fly... I get it...
seems insignificant, right?

170
00:14:38,636 --> 00:14:39,560
But trust me.

171
00:14:39,685 --> 00:14:41,993
In a highly controlled
environment such as this...

172
00:14:46,573 --> 00:14:47,677
any pollutant...

173
00:14:49,729 --> 00:14:51,329
no matter how small...

174
00:14:55,573 --> 00:14:57,123
could completely...

175
00:15:15,543 --> 00:15:16,456
What?

176
00:15:20,145 --> 00:15:22,014
Were you here all night?

177
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:24,893
Have you even slept?

178
00:15:26,211 --> 00:15:27,751
No. Jesse, look.
I'm fine. Okay

179
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:29,761
Will you just please focus...

180
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,811
Okay, look. We're running late,
so let's just get started.

181
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:40,244
Shall we? The sooner we do
it, the sooner we're done.

182
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,335
Frickin' finally.

183
00:15:48,374 --> 00:15:49,824
What are you doing?

184
00:15:50,142 --> 00:15:51,742
It's time to alkaline.

185
00:15:52,266 --> 00:15:55,120
Have you not heard a word I said?

186
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:58,540
No cooking until this fly
is dealt with.

187
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:00,884
Have I been speaking to myself?

188
00:16:01,487 --> 00:16:02,936
The timer went off.

189
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,557
How long is this batch going
to be good for? An hour? Two?

190
00:16:07,264 --> 00:16:09,036
The batch will be good for nothing

191
00:16:09,161 --> 00:16:11,108
if we don't clear the contaminant.

192
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,013
Clear the contaminant?

193
00:16:13,296 --> 00:16:14,820
We're making meth here,

194
00:16:15,067 --> 00:16:16,239
not space shuttles.

195
00:16:16,364 --> 00:16:19,400
We're making nothing
until we catch this fly.

196
00:16:19,836 --> 00:16:20,836
What fly?

197
00:16:21,377 --> 00:16:22,724
Where the hell is

198
00:16:23,056 --> 00:16:25,320
this fly?
Not like I've even seen the thing.

199
00:16:25,445 --> 00:16:28,320
Maybe your positive pressure blew
it out the door or something.

200
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,239
No, no. It is here.
It is around. Okay?

201
00:16:32,181 --> 00:16:34,438
He's around,
and am not going to expose

202
00:16:34,563 --> 00:16:37,555
this batch to the open air
and contamination.

203
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,291
Now, you can leave me to deal with
this myself, or you can help me,

204
00:16:41,562 --> 00:16:43,917
but you are right.
We are running out of time,

205
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:45,990
so I need your answer right now.

206
00:16:53,738 --> 00:16:54,530
Okay.

207
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,316
Hey, tick-tock.

208
00:17:15,882 --> 00:17:19,212
Look, I like making cherry
products, but let's keep it real.

209
00:17:19,337 --> 00:17:21,455
All right, we make poison

210
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:23,340
for people who don't care.

211
00:17:23,995 --> 00:17:26,832
We probably have the most
unpicky customers in the world.

212
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:29,467
No rationalizing.

213
00:17:29,592 --> 00:17:32,060
We'll find it any minute now.
Don't give up.

214
00:17:44,888 --> 00:17:45,941
Did you...

215
00:17:46,643 --> 00:17:48,167
Did you know that there's

216
00:17:48,292 --> 00:17:50,555
an acceptable level of rat turds

217
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,752
that can go into candy bars?

218
00:17:54,584 --> 00:17:56,789
That's the government, Jack.

219
00:17:57,517 --> 00:17:59,552
Even the government

220
00:17:59,898 --> 00:18:02,960
doesn't care that much
about quality.

221
00:18:04,727 --> 00:18:06,252
You know what is

222
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:09,471
okay to put in hotdogs?

223
00:18:11,505 --> 00:18:13,758
Pig lips and assholes,

224
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:17,268
but I say, hey, have at it, bitches,

225
00:18:17,393 --> 00:18:20,062
because I love hotdogs,

226
00:18:21,043 --> 00:18:23,768
and, you know, see what I'm...

227
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,343
What are you doing?

228
00:18:29,427 --> 00:18:31,349
Look, let me just top it off,

229
00:18:31,474 --> 00:18:33,194
all right, really quick.

230
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,530
A little sodium hydroxide,
shut the lid.

231
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,325
No harm done.
Then we're golden.

232
00:18:42,697 --> 00:18:45,508
It stays closed.
That's an order.

233
00:18:45,633 --> 00:18:47,739
You can't order shit, Adolf.

234
00:18:47,864 --> 00:18:50,154
We're 50-50 partners.

235
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:51,421
Remember?

236
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,031
God, what is your problem, bro?

237
00:19:03,118 --> 00:19:04,734
Freakin' psycho.

238
00:19:07,842 --> 00:19:08,633
God,

239
00:19:08,758 --> 00:19:10,288
it, like, hit bone.

240
00:19:16,651 --> 00:19:18,051
You see it, right?

241
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,736
You see it?

242
00:19:25,535 --> 00:19:26,532
Get it.

243
00:19:28,988 --> 00:19:30,502
You want me to get it?

244
00:19:37,345 --> 00:19:38,523
Slow.

245
00:19:38,648 --> 00:19:40,146
Move slowly.

246
00:19:40,716 --> 00:19:41,667
I know.

247
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:43,284
I'm moving slowly, yeah.

248
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,935
Absolutely. I'm just going
to need your swatter thing.

249
00:19:50,758 --> 00:19:51,941
Come on.

250
00:19:54,544 --> 00:19:55,860
It's okay, come on.

251
00:19:59,009 --> 00:20:00,598
- Come on.
- Make it count.

252
00:20:00,723 --> 00:20:01,574
I'm gonna...

253
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,755
I'm going to make it count,
all right.

254
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:06,837
Now.

255
00:20:07,196 --> 00:20:08,373
On three.

256
00:20:10,428 --> 00:20:11,532
One...

257
00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:17,307
You like that?
Hurts?

258
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,551
- Did you get it?
- I think so.

259
00:20:24,676 --> 00:20:27,016
- Where is it?
- I don't know. It doesn't matter.

260
00:20:27,141 --> 00:20:28,931
Who cares?
I got it.

261
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:31,696
- Jesus, seriously?
- Where is it?

262
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:34,585
It's,

263
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,242
right there.
Look.

264
00:20:37,095 --> 00:20:38,145
Look.

265
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,110
See?
I told you I got it.

266
00:20:50,011 --> 00:20:51,361
This is a raisin.

267
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:55,324
Look, I definitely got it, man.

268
00:20:58,519 --> 00:20:59,451
Man.

269
00:21:00,988 --> 00:21:02,671
He's got some skills.

270
00:21:03,838 --> 00:21:05,138
I'll give him that.

271
00:21:05,977 --> 00:21:06,977
Look...

272
00:21:09,464 --> 00:21:11,156
I feel like I'm

273
00:21:11,281 --> 00:21:13,744
running out of ways
to explain this to you,

274
00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:16,113
but once more I shall try.

275
00:21:17,507 --> 00:21:20,318
This fly is a major problem for us.

276
00:21:21,512 --> 00:21:23,392
It will ruin our batch.

277
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:26,092
Now, we need to destroy it

278
00:21:26,217 --> 00:21:27,701
and every trace of it

279
00:21:27,826 --> 00:21:28,786
so we can cook.

280
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:31,605
Failing that...

281
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,843
we're dead.

282
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,348
There is no more room for error.

283
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:46,337
Not with these people.

284
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:52,025
All right,
how about we go get some air?

285
00:21:53,851 --> 00:21:55,021
Get some air?

286
00:21:55,441 --> 00:21:59,090
Your answer to "We're sliding
head-first into a massive crap..."

287
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:03,895
I understand that
the fly is a serious thing.

288
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,426
Now, all right?
I'm on board.

289
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:08,939
I'm just saying maybe
if we went and got some air,

290
00:22:09,064 --> 00:22:12,330
it would help us come up with
a plan on how to catch it.

291
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:13,974
Then come back down here

292
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,649
and subtract his ass.

293
00:22:37,472 --> 00:22:39,288
Wait, do you have your keys?

294
00:22:39,413 --> 00:22:40,871
- Yeah.
- You're sure?

295
00:22:40,996 --> 00:22:43,015
Last thing we need
is to get locked out.

296
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,140
Yeah.

297
00:22:46,303 --> 00:22:48,658
If you're not going to help me,
stay out of my way!

298
00:22:57,249 --> 00:22:59,156
Does somebody have an ax I can use?

299
00:22:59,281 --> 00:23:00,281
<i>El ax-o!</i>

300
00:23:00,824 --> 00:23:02,380
<i>Peligroso! El ax-o!</i>

301
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,351
There we go.

302
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:42,069
Say good night.

303
00:23:45,028 --> 00:23:46,626
Son of a bitch!

304
00:23:51,216 --> 00:23:52,266
Son of a...

305
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:56,809
Damn it!

306
00:23:59,723 --> 00:24:01,386
Where in the hell is that...

307
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,649
Need some juice maybe?

308
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,900
Knock yourself out.

309
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:33,513
It's a real one.

310
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:35,640
Yeah, like yours was working.

311
00:24:39,465 --> 00:24:41,283
Look, we're trying to decontaminate.

312
00:24:41,408 --> 00:24:44,086
You don't decontaminate
by contaminating further.

313
00:24:44,211 --> 00:24:46,011
What the hell is all this?

314
00:24:48,139 --> 00:24:49,887
Here, how about this?

315
00:24:51,186 --> 00:24:52,948
"Nontoxic glue strips."

316
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,798
It's got pheromones.
I got a buttload.

317
00:24:56,923 --> 00:25:00,039
We hang them up all over the place.
It won't be able to resist.

318
00:25:06,242 --> 00:25:07,907
I sure hope we have enough.

319
00:25:08,803 --> 00:25:11,728
I'm going to go out
on a limb and say yeah.

320
00:25:13,466 --> 00:25:14,716
Do you see him?

321
00:25:17,214 --> 00:25:19,591
How long do you think
you've been awake?

322
00:25:19,716 --> 00:25:21,674
Why do you keep asking me that?

323
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:24,510
Just figure
you could use some coffee, is all.

324
00:25:24,635 --> 00:25:25,885
I know I could.

325
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:27,676
How about it?

326
00:25:30,351 --> 00:25:31,351
Yeah.

327
00:25:34,342 --> 00:25:35,868
You take cream and sugar?

328
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:36,993
Black is fine.

329
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:52,331
Why don't you just leave him be?

330
00:25:52,778 --> 00:25:54,578
Let the traps do the work.

331
00:25:55,546 --> 00:25:58,496
These pheromones
are supposed to kick ass.

332
00:26:00,187 --> 00:26:04,191
I bet we catch this
mo-fo any second.

333
00:26:17,585 --> 00:26:18,585
Thank you.

334
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:23,458
You ever have, like, a wild animal

335
00:26:24,022 --> 00:26:25,622
trapped in your house?

336
00:26:29,691 --> 00:26:31,937
Not that I can recall, no.

337
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:35,541
We did, this one time,

338
00:26:36,069 --> 00:26:38,304
back when it was my aunt's house,

339
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:40,590
back before she died of cancer.

340
00:26:42,252 --> 00:26:43,252
Possum.

341
00:26:43,708 --> 00:26:46,528
Big, freaky-looking bitch.

342
00:26:47,016 --> 00:26:49,716
Since when
did they change it to "opossum"?

343
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:52,083
What's up with that?
When I was coming up,

344
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:53,831
it was just "possum".

345
00:26:54,427 --> 00:26:58,013
"Opossum" makes it sound
like he's Irish or something.

346
00:26:58,138 --> 00:27:01,409
Why they gotta go changing
everything?

347
00:27:01,762 --> 00:27:04,184
Whatever.
They're just big rats anyways,

348
00:27:04,309 --> 00:27:08,221
giant pink-tailed rats
with their pink rat faces,

349
00:27:08,517 --> 00:27:09,767
totally freaky,

350
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:12,482
like alien rats.

351
00:27:15,283 --> 00:27:18,512
Actually, it's not so much
that he got trapped,

352
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:22,056
but he was living there
under the house.

353
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:26,189
You could hear him going from,
like, room to room,

354
00:27:26,314 --> 00:27:29,271
always scurrying around.

355
00:27:29,396 --> 00:27:31,477
Sometimes I'd see him
outside at night,

356
00:27:31,602 --> 00:27:33,902
and he would just, you know, freeze.

357
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:38,284
And it's like you're not
looking right at it. Right?

358
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:40,659
I mean, it thinks it's fooling you.

359
00:27:41,523 --> 00:27:44,990
That's what they do.
They play dead or whatever.

360
00:27:45,115 --> 00:27:47,515
It's just so lame.

361
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,455
Is there a discernible point
to this story,

362
00:27:53,122 --> 00:27:55,667
a point that you'll be arriving at

363
00:27:55,792 --> 00:27:57,692
sometime in the near future?

364
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:02,933
It was just a total bitch
to get out. It took forever.

365
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:04,108
A guy came,

366
00:28:04,925 --> 00:28:06,825
set all these traps and all,

367
00:28:07,847 --> 00:28:09,769
and he finally got it,

368
00:28:09,894 --> 00:28:12,000
but my aunt,

369
00:28:12,423 --> 00:28:14,023
she didn't believe it.

370
00:28:15,474 --> 00:28:19,465
She kept insisting
she could still hear the thing.

371
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:22,896
I mean, you could not tell her
any different.

372
00:28:23,021 --> 00:28:24,940
She started keeping an old umbrella

373
00:28:25,065 --> 00:28:26,215
by her chair.

374
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:30,324
Man, she would just bang
on the floor and yell at it,

375
00:28:30,449 --> 00:28:32,668
even gave it a name.

376
00:28:33,302 --> 00:28:34,302
It was...

377
00:28:35,397 --> 00:28:36,397
Scrabble.

378
00:28:37,145 --> 00:28:38,408
Yeah, that was it.

379
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:41,428
"Scrabble, just knock it off."
Bang, bang, bang.

380
00:28:44,972 --> 00:28:47,974
She got like that toward the end.

381
00:28:50,034 --> 00:28:52,356
Got obsessive about stuff,

382
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:55,477
just got mad about stuff.

383
00:28:56,786 --> 00:28:58,636
We didn't know what was up.

384
00:28:59,741 --> 00:29:03,020
It wasn't like her to be that way.

385
00:29:06,957 --> 00:29:08,907
But it turned out that the...

386
00:29:09,743 --> 00:29:12,647
the cancer had spread to her brain,

387
00:29:12,772 --> 00:29:14,122
and that was why.

388
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,771
It metastasized.

389
00:29:21,608 --> 00:29:24,405
But it was good
that that was when we decided

390
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,790
to take her to the doctor
because then

391
00:29:27,804 --> 00:29:29,254
we knew what was up

392
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:32,737
and got her some treatment

393
00:29:33,754 --> 00:29:36,148
and meds so she wasn't stressing
all the time.

394
00:29:41,043 --> 00:29:43,811
It was a lot better after that.

395
00:29:44,965 --> 00:29:47,613
She was a lot happier.

396
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:57,636
Where the hell is he?

397
00:30:07,178 --> 00:30:09,378
I've been to my oncologist, Jesse,

398
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:11,849
just last week.

399
00:30:14,664 --> 00:30:16,314
I'm still in remission.

400
00:30:18,256 --> 00:30:19,356
I'm healthy.

401
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,750
Good.

402
00:30:23,306 --> 00:30:24,306
Great.

403
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:30,411
No end in sight.

404
00:30:32,444 --> 00:30:33,707
That's great.

405
00:30:39,407 --> 00:30:40,507
I missed it.

406
00:30:46,634 --> 00:30:50,298
There was some perfect moment,

407
00:30:51,188 --> 00:30:52,988
and it passed me right by.

408
00:30:55,672 --> 00:30:59,604
Yeah, I had to have enough
to leave them.

409
00:31:00,509 --> 00:31:02,259
That was the whole point.

410
00:31:06,534 --> 00:31:10,209
None of this makes any sense
if I didn't have enough.

411
00:31:12,531 --> 00:31:15,243
But it had to be
before she found out...

412
00:31:15,368 --> 00:31:16,368
Skyler.

413
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:19,026
It had to be before that.

414
00:31:19,703 --> 00:31:21,053
Perfect moment...

415
00:31:22,852 --> 00:31:23,852
for what?

416
00:31:25,739 --> 00:31:26,889
To drop dead?

417
00:31:28,827 --> 00:31:31,227
What, are you saying
you want to die?

418
00:31:33,872 --> 00:31:37,506
I'm saying I've lived too long.

419
00:31:41,863 --> 00:31:44,113
You want them to actually miss you.

420
00:31:44,501 --> 00:31:45,501
You know?

421
00:31:47,091 --> 00:31:50,726
You want their memories of you
to be...

422
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:56,080
But she just won't...

423
00:31:56,328 --> 00:31:58,630
She just won't understand.

424
00:31:59,769 --> 00:32:00,919
No matter how...

425
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,163
well I explain it,

426
00:32:04,636 --> 00:32:06,907
these days she just has this...

427
00:32:07,832 --> 00:32:08,832
this...

428
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,676
I mean, I truly believe

429
00:32:12,801 --> 00:32:15,884
there exists
some combination of words.

430
00:32:16,845 --> 00:32:19,367
There must exist certain words

431
00:32:19,492 --> 00:32:22,371
in a certain, specific order

432
00:32:22,496 --> 00:32:24,173
that would explain all of this,

433
00:32:24,298 --> 00:32:26,937
but with her I just...

434
00:32:28,263 --> 00:32:31,203
I just can't ever seem to find them.

435
00:32:31,328 --> 00:32:33,584
Mr. White,
how about you just sit down?

436
00:32:34,607 --> 00:32:36,605
I was thinking maybe
before the fugue state,

437
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:40,109
but before the fugue state
they didn't have enough money,

438
00:32:40,234 --> 00:32:42,685
so no, not then.

439
00:32:51,754 --> 00:32:54,896
And plus my daughter
wasn't born yet.

440
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,950
It had to be after Holly was born.

441
00:33:01,389 --> 00:33:03,389
Definitely before the surgery.

442
00:33:05,867 --> 00:33:07,104
Oh, Christ.

443
00:33:08,459 --> 00:33:10,259
That damn second cellphone.

444
00:33:10,766 --> 00:33:12,416
How could I possibly...

445
00:33:24,063 --> 00:33:25,463
I know the moment.

446
00:33:30,338 --> 00:33:32,926
It was the night Jane died.

447
00:33:42,017 --> 00:33:43,638
I was at home and...

448
00:33:44,046 --> 00:33:46,003
And we needed diapers,

449
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:48,619
and so I said I'd go,

450
00:33:49,092 --> 00:33:51,219
but it was just an excuse.

451
00:33:51,982 --> 00:33:53,910
Actually, that was the night I...

452
00:33:54,035 --> 00:33:56,285
I brought you your money, remember?

453
00:33:56,609 --> 00:33:58,800
Yeah, I remember.

454
00:34:00,194 --> 00:34:03,107
But afterward I stopped at a bar.

455
00:34:04,434 --> 00:34:08,351
It was odd.
I never do that, go to a bar alone.

456
00:34:09,501 --> 00:34:12,197
I just walked in, sat down.

457
00:34:17,562 --> 00:34:18,912
I never told you.

458
00:34:20,485 --> 00:34:22,135
That you went to a bar?

459
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:32,109
I sit down, and this man,
this stranger,

460
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:34,879
he engages me in conversation.

461
00:34:35,004 --> 00:34:36,657
Now, he's a complete stranger.

462
00:34:38,725 --> 00:34:42,507
But he turns out
to be Jane's father,

463
00:34:43,142 --> 00:34:44,702
Donald Margolis.

464
00:34:45,979 --> 00:34:47,733
What are you talking about?

465
00:34:47,858 --> 00:34:49,378
I didn't know it at the time.

466
00:34:50,741 --> 00:34:53,191
I mean,
it was just some guy in a bar.

467
00:34:53,831 --> 00:34:56,530
I didn't put it together
until after the crash

468
00:34:56,655 --> 00:34:58,061
when he was all over the news.

469
00:34:58,186 --> 00:35:00,251
Jane's dad.

470
00:35:00,653 --> 00:35:02,284
Think of the odds.

471
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,602
Once I tried to calculate them,

472
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,340
but they're astronomical.

473
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,040
Think of the odds

474
00:35:10,773 --> 00:35:12,673
of me going in, sitting down

475
00:35:13,155 --> 00:35:16,268
that night in that bar
next to that man.

476
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:21,650
What did you talk about?

477
00:35:26,789 --> 00:35:28,197
Water on Mars.

478
00:35:32,492 --> 00:35:33,492
Family.

479
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,322
What about family?

480
00:35:41,923 --> 00:35:43,821
I told him that I had a daughter,

481
00:35:43,946 --> 00:35:46,307
and he told me he had one, too.

482
00:35:47,929 --> 00:35:49,079
Then he said,

483
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:52,024
"Never give up on family."

484
00:35:55,234 --> 00:35:56,384
And I didn't.

485
00:35:59,884 --> 00:36:01,305
I took his advice.

486
00:36:16,499 --> 00:36:17,918
The universe is random.

487
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:19,507
It's not inevitable.

488
00:36:19,632 --> 00:36:22,086
It's simple chaos.

489
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:27,663
It's subatomic particles
in endless, aimless collision.

490
00:36:27,788 --> 00:36:30,395
That's what science teaches us,

491
00:36:31,327 --> 00:36:33,027
but what is this saying?

492
00:36:35,305 --> 00:36:38,167
What is it telling us,
when on the very night

493
00:36:38,917 --> 00:36:41,928
that this man's daughter dies,

494
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:46,337
it's me who's having
a drink with him?

495
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,880
How can that be random?

496
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:56,087
Sit down.

497
00:37:11,618 --> 00:37:13,118
That was the moment.

498
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,280
That night.

499
00:37:20,217 --> 00:37:22,217
I should never have left home.

500
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:27,294
Never gone to your house.

501
00:37:32,657 --> 00:37:35,264
Maybe things would have...

502
00:37:42,364 --> 00:37:43,664
Thought I was...

503
00:37:46,128 --> 00:37:49,181
I was at home watching TV.

504
00:37:51,051 --> 00:37:52,051
Some...

505
00:37:53,754 --> 00:37:57,522
Some nature program about elephants.

506
00:38:00,472 --> 00:38:02,922
Skyler and Holly
were in another room.

507
00:38:06,392 --> 00:38:08,842
I could hear them
on the baby monitor.

508
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:14,663
She was singing a lullaby.

509
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:27,812
If had just lived
right up to that moment

510
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,240
and not one second more...

511
00:38:44,815 --> 00:38:46,865
... that would've been perfect.

512
00:39:00,462 --> 00:39:02,012
He's not coming down.

513
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:05,575
Must be Thailand-hot up there.

514
00:39:06,602 --> 00:39:08,252
That's why he likes it.

515
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,490
Thailand's hot, right?

516
00:39:14,069 --> 00:39:15,069
Yeah.

517
00:39:15,342 --> 00:39:17,130
See? That's why.

518
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,100
Wait.

519
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:22,777
Here.

520
00:39:37,632 --> 00:39:39,314
He's not coming down.

521
00:39:42,084 --> 00:39:44,084
He's staying up there forever.

522
00:40:10,651 --> 00:40:12,069
What are you doing?

523
00:40:12,194 --> 00:40:15,094
What do you think?
I'm going to get that bitch.

524
00:40:20,087 --> 00:40:22,387
No, you're going to break your neck.

525
00:40:22,971 --> 00:40:24,763
Yeah, yeah. Just...

526
00:40:27,275 --> 00:40:30,025
No, seriously, you're...
This is a bad idea.

527
00:40:31,876 --> 00:40:32,876
Damn it.

528
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:36,641
Just hold onto it.

529
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:38,549
Hold it still?

530
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,464
I'm sorry.

531
00:41:01,121 --> 00:41:02,510
Sorry for what?

532
00:41:02,635 --> 00:41:03,991
Being a lunatic?

533
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:09,920
I'm sorry about Jane.

534
00:41:19,799 --> 00:41:20,799
Me, too.

535
00:41:23,821 --> 00:41:25,003
I mean...

536
00:41:28,488 --> 00:41:31,559
I'm very sorry.

537
00:41:37,407 --> 00:41:38,907
It's not your fault.

538
00:41:40,469 --> 00:41:43,036
But it's not mine either.

539
00:41:43,727 --> 00:41:45,505
It's no one's fault,

540
00:41:45,948 --> 00:41:47,148
not even hers.

541
00:41:54,072 --> 00:41:55,835
Sucker's just sitting there.

542
00:41:59,104 --> 00:42:00,504
We are who we are.

543
00:42:03,243 --> 00:42:05,751
You know, just two junkies

544
00:42:05,876 --> 00:42:07,926
with a duffel bag full of cash.

545
00:42:08,832 --> 00:42:10,032
Like you said,

546
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:13,530
we both would've been dead
within a week.

547
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:16,100
But I miss her, though.

548
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:21,817
God, I do.

549
00:42:32,517 --> 00:42:33,517
Come down.

550
00:42:34,437 --> 00:42:35,437
Wait,

551
00:42:35,854 --> 00:42:37,596
I am so close.

552
00:42:40,435 --> 00:42:41,543
Let it go.

553
00:42:43,449 --> 00:42:44,644
We need to cook.

554
00:42:45,635 --> 00:42:47,522
What about the contamination?

555
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:51,096
It's all contaminated.

556
00:43:00,189 --> 00:43:01,889
I definitely scared him.

557
00:43:04,325 --> 00:43:06,375
Probably stay out of our way...

558
00:43:39,862 --> 00:43:41,851
Somebody got caught, yo!

559
00:43:41,976 --> 00:43:43,626
You see that, Mister...

560
00:44:31,499 --> 00:44:32,799
Bins are packed?

561
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:35,350
Bins are packed.

562
00:44:36,847 --> 00:44:38,147
How's the yield?

563
00:44:38,477 --> 00:44:40,077
Two-oh-two and change.

564
00:44:41,826 --> 00:44:43,426
You okay getting home?

565
00:44:43,732 --> 00:44:45,144
Yeah. Better.

566
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:46,940
Thanks.

567
00:44:47,331 --> 00:44:48,471
<i>Mañana</i>, then.

568
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:06,285
Come here.

569
00:45:09,869 --> 00:45:12,123
I couldn't chance saying it inside.

570
00:45:12,248 --> 00:45:15,269
For all I know,
the lab's wired for sound.

571
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:21,008
That half a pound
that I said we're off by...

572
00:45:22,336 --> 00:45:25,404
Now, I'm not accusing you, but if...

573
00:45:26,733 --> 00:45:27,991
You understand?

574
00:45:28,116 --> 00:45:30,066
And if they ever found out...

575
00:45:33,623 --> 00:45:35,401
I didn't take shit.

576
00:45:41,275 --> 00:45:44,532
I'm just saying that I won't
be able to protect you.

577
00:45:45,894 --> 00:45:47,394
Who's asking you to?
