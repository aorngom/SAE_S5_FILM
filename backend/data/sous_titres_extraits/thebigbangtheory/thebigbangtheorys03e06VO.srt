1
00:00:01,873 --> 00:00:02,873
Kites, ho!

2
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:05,805
Kites, ho!

3
00:00:07,119 --> 00:00:08,177
Excuse me.

4
00:00:08,365 --> 00:00:10,092
You're misusing the word "ho."

5
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,010
It's an interjection
used to call attention

6
00:00:13,135 --> 00:00:14,852
to a destination, not an object,

7
00:00:14,977 --> 00:00:18,325
as in "land, ho!" or "westward, ho!"

8
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:22,221
Kites, ho!

9
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,067
Hey, guys. Whatcha doin'?

10
00:00:26,335 --> 00:00:28,535
Going out to discover electricity?

11
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:31,660
If you're referring to the work
of Benjamin Franklin,

12
00:00:31,785 --> 00:00:33,449
he did not "discover electricity,"

13
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:37,331
he merely used a kite to determine
that lignining consists of electricity.

14
00:00:37,534 --> 00:00:39,128
He also invented the Franklin stove,

15
00:00:39,253 --> 00:00:41,953
bifocals and the flexible
urinary catheter.

16
00:00:45,183 --> 00:00:46,183
Kites, ho.

17
00:00:47,841 --> 00:00:50,925
- We're heading for some kite fighting.
- "Kite fighting"?

18
00:00:51,094 --> 00:00:53,673
It's an extremely competitive,
cutthroat sport.

19
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:58,188
Actually, the risk
of throat cutting is very low.

20
00:00:58,538 --> 00:01:02,542
On the other hand, severe string burn
is a real and ever-present danger.

21
00:01:03,648 --> 00:01:04,939
You want to come watch?

22
00:01:05,952 --> 00:01:08,397
Gee... sounds amazing.

23
00:01:08,592 --> 00:01:10,403
But, I've got some friends
coming over.

24
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,822
Not a big thing...
we're gonna watch the Nebraska game.

25
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,274
Football, sure.

26
00:01:15,449 --> 00:01:16,449
Good guess.

27
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,330
I would've invited you,
but you're not a football fan.

28
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:23,666
No, no, I'm not, so... great.

29
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:26,143
You've got plans
doing something you like,

30
00:01:26,268 --> 00:01:28,028
I've got plans
doing something I like,

31
00:01:28,153 --> 00:01:28,963
it's good.

32
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,465
Maybe we'll hang out later,
after everybody's gone.

33
00:01:31,981 --> 00:01:33,149
Yeah, great.

34
00:01:33,545 --> 00:01:34,545
See ya.

35
00:01:38,347 --> 00:01:39,697
Well, this sucks.

36
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:43,602
I'm sorry, I got bored
and drifted off.

37
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:49,307
Where exactly in the interaction
did the sucking lie?

38
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:52,537
Leonard realized that Penny's been
hiding him from her friends

39
00:01:52,662 --> 00:01:55,194
because he's a tiny, little man
who flies kites.

40
00:01:57,028 --> 00:01:58,367
That certainly would suck.

41
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,622
Episode 306:
The Cornhusker Vortex

42
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,515
Sync: Golgi, Linwelin, Loky

43
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,013
www.subbercafe.fr

44
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:30,232
Wolowitz is trying to outflank us.

45
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,578
Let out some string, add altitude
and I'll go under and cut his line.

46
00:02:34,456 --> 00:02:36,489
Why wouldn't Penny want
her friends to meet me?

47
00:02:36,658 --> 00:02:38,069
Focus, Leonard, focus!

48
00:02:38,194 --> 00:02:41,285
The heat of battle is upon us.
The dogs of war are unleashed.

49
00:02:42,431 --> 00:02:45,000
Maybe Koothrappali's right.
Maybe I embarrass her.

50
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,736
You're embarrassing me.

51
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:48,992
A grown man worrying
about such nonsense

52
00:02:49,117 --> 00:02:51,367
when in the middle of flying kites.

53
00:02:52,986 --> 00:02:53,756
Sorry.

54
00:02:53,986 --> 00:02:55,924
Sorry won't bring their kites down.

55
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,693
String burn!

56
00:03:01,676 --> 00:03:04,390
They think we're flanking.
They're playing right into our hands.

57
00:03:04,515 --> 00:03:07,238
On the count of three,
we execute the flying scissor.

58
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:09,043
One, two...

59
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,725
- Did you see that?
- What?

60
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,609
That chick, she smiled at me.

61
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:15,027
- No.
- Yes, she did.

62
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,404
- Come on, scissors, scissors!
- Hold my line.

63
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,759
What are you doing?
I can't scissors by myself!

64
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,450
Come back!

65
00:03:22,352 --> 00:03:23,352
Victory!

66
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:26,249
Son of a bitch.

67
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:31,794
You're a sucky friend,
you know that?

68
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:34,147
A sucky, sucky friend.

69
00:03:35,155 --> 00:03:38,472
What was I supposed to do?
She gave me that "come-hit her" look.

70
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:42,200
If she gave you any look at all,
it was a "you suck" look.

71
00:03:44,082 --> 00:03:46,684
I would've caught up to her
if I hadn't pulled a hammy.

72
00:03:47,091 --> 00:03:49,660
Please, you weigh 80 pounds.
You don't have a hammy.

73
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,731
Penny doesn't want me
around her friends.

74
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,017
I embarrass her.
What else could it be?

75
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,135
Her actions could be
out of concern for your feelings.

76
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,444
Perhaps she's excluded you
from these gatherings

77
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:03,192
because she's scouting
for a new mate

78
00:04:03,317 --> 00:04:05,286
and doesn't want to do it
in front of you.

79
00:04:07,621 --> 00:04:08,914
How kind of her.

80
00:04:09,473 --> 00:04:10,334
Agreed.

81
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,871
Most primates don't show
that sort of discretion.

82
00:04:12,996 --> 00:04:16,372
A female bonobo will copulate
with a new male in front of the old one

83
00:04:16,497 --> 00:04:18,897
without so much
as a "how do you do?"

84
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:20,958
You always do this.

85
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,137
You ditch me for a woman
you don't have a shot with.

86
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,303
I had a shot.

87
00:04:24,428 --> 00:04:26,343
With a woman you were chasing
through a park...

88
00:04:26,468 --> 00:04:28,718
that's not a shot, that's a felony.

89
00:04:30,525 --> 00:04:33,856
What's worse, it cost me
my prized patang fighting kite.

90
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:37,902
I don't suppose there's any chance
you could give me my kite back?

91
00:04:38,417 --> 00:04:41,117
I'm sorry, Raj,
but the rules of aerial warfare

92
00:04:41,242 --> 00:04:43,490
dictate that the fallen kite
go to the victor.

93
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,160
And without rules,
the competition has no meaning.

94
00:04:46,498 --> 00:04:49,371
And without meaning,
the following would be an empty gesture.

95
00:04:49,995 --> 00:04:51,303
I have your kite.

96
00:04:51,428 --> 00:04:52,778
I have your kite.

97
00:05:03,707 --> 00:05:05,054
How was your football party?

98
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:07,056
It was pretty good.
We won.

99
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,590
That's excellent.

100
00:05:08,715 --> 00:05:10,274
It's a weird figure of speech.

101
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,049
"We won" when you weren't
actually playing.

102
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:18,275
When we watch <i>Star Wars</i>, we don't say,
"We defeated the Empire. "

103
00:05:19,576 --> 00:05:21,076
I'm glad to hear it.

104
00:05:22,548 --> 00:05:23,739
On a related subject,

105
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:26,240
are you embarrassed
to have me around your friends?

106
00:05:27,707 --> 00:05:30,371
Oh, my god, no.
Why would you ask that?

107
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:34,297
You know, I just noticed
I haven't really met any of them.

108
00:05:34,422 --> 00:05:35,612
Sure you have.

109
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,605
I met the huge ex-boyfriend

110
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:42,491
and the smaller yet still
larger than me ex-boyfriend.

111
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:45,511
By the way, were they here today?

112
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,323
- Of course not.
- Why would they be?

113
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:49,946
Why would I ask? Why am I rambling?
Why don't you stop me?

114
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,520
If you want to meet my friends,
that would be great.

115
00:05:55,196 --> 00:05:57,368
You know, I didn't
want you to be bored.

116
00:05:57,493 --> 00:05:59,884
I wouldn't be bored.
Why would I be bored?

117
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,403
'Cause they're not
genius scientists.

118
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,218
Penny, I like all sorts of people.

119
00:06:05,343 --> 00:06:07,643
Some of my best friends
aren't geniuses.

120
00:06:09,595 --> 00:06:10,494
Like who?

121
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:17,053
Some of my Facebook friends
aren't geniuses.

122
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,086
My point is,
if we're going to be a couple,

123
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:22,297
I should be friends
with your friends.

124
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:23,272
Great.

125
00:06:23,397 --> 00:06:25,967
Then come over next Saturday
and watch the game with us.

126
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,118
Another football game?

127
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,513
They have them every week.

128
00:06:30,944 --> 00:06:32,203
Did not know that.

129
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:35,518
- You wanted to meet my friends.
- Sure.

130
00:06:35,688 --> 00:06:37,723
Just I don't know much
about football.

131
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,956
A lot of the guys' girlfriends
don't know football.

132
00:06:40,081 --> 00:06:42,481
They just kind of drink
and talk in the kitchen.

133
00:06:44,182 --> 00:06:45,098
Great.

134
00:06:50,957 --> 00:06:52,935
Okay, a completed pass.

135
00:06:53,744 --> 00:06:55,248
First down, New England.

136
00:06:57,686 --> 00:07:00,461
- I think I'm starting to get this.
- Really?

137
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:04,326
The only thing I've learned
is that American men love drinking beer,

138
00:07:04,451 --> 00:07:06,919
pee too often
and have trouble getting erections.

139
00:07:11,205 --> 00:07:13,597
Focus on the game,
not the commercials.

140
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,357
Maybe if you people
cut back on the beer,

141
00:07:16,482 --> 00:07:18,613
you could get out of the bathroom
and satisfy your women

142
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,064
without pharmaceutical help.

143
00:07:23,287 --> 00:07:24,817
Raj, what are you doing here?

144
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:27,307
You were supposed to help me
pimp out my Vespa.

145
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:30,824
I'm sorry, are you under the impression
that we're still friends?

146
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:33,127
Come on.

147
00:07:33,747 --> 00:07:36,288
You're not still grinding
on the kite thing, are you?

148
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,148
It's not just the kite thing.
Every time we go some place,

149
00:07:39,273 --> 00:07:41,526
you think you can dump me
when someone prettier comes along,

150
00:07:41,651 --> 00:07:43,462
even though you don't have
a shot with them.

151
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,672
I had a shot with that jogger.

152
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:49,062
Fine. Paint green flames
on your little scooter with her.

153
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,243
It's not a little scooter.

154
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,549
It's the second biggest
Vespa they make!

155
00:07:57,829 --> 00:07:59,644
Are you watching football?

156
00:07:59,998 --> 00:08:01,358
There's no fooling you.

157
00:08:03,244 --> 00:08:06,833
Now, what is this sacks statistic
they put up there?

158
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,655
All I know about Saks is
my mother shops there.

159
00:08:12,987 --> 00:08:15,347
Sacks, sacks...

160
00:08:15,472 --> 00:08:16,787
It's football nomenclature

161
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:20,207
for when a quarterback is tackled
behind the line of scrimmage.

162
00:08:23,956 --> 00:08:24,956
Scrimmage.

163
00:08:26,808 --> 00:08:28,005
The line of scrimmage

164
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:32,144
is the imaginary transverse line
separating the offense from the defense.

165
00:08:35,408 --> 00:08:37,190
Sheldon knows football?

166
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,209
Apparently.

167
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,706
I mean, Quidditch, sure.
But football?

168
00:08:45,018 --> 00:08:46,769
Sheldon, how do you know this stuff?

169
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,166
I grew up in Texas.
Football is ubiquitous in Texas:

170
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,113
Pro football, college football,

171
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:54,157
high school football,
peewee football...

172
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:58,160
in fact, every form of football
except the original European football.

173
00:08:59,275 --> 00:09:01,564
Which most Texans believe
to be a commie plot.

174
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:04,895
Unbelievable.

175
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,236
If you're interested,
I also know all about frying meat

176
00:09:07,361 --> 00:09:09,536
that isn't chicken
as if it were chicken.

177
00:09:13,642 --> 00:09:15,220
So you could teach me?

178
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:18,267
Football or chicken-fried meats?

179
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,027
Football.

180
00:09:21,152 --> 00:09:23,206
I'm going to Penny's
to watch a game with her friends

181
00:09:23,331 --> 00:09:25,898
and I don't want to look like an idiot.
I want to blend in.

182
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,380
If you want to blend in

183
00:09:27,505 --> 00:09:30,593
I'd think looking like an idiot
would be the perfect camouflage.

184
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,930
Come on, please teach me
about football. It'll be fun.

185
00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:36,592
That's exactly what my father said.

186
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:39,194
"Come to the games.
Watch the games."

187
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:41,518
Week in and week out
from the time I was five

188
00:09:41,643 --> 00:09:43,209
until I went off to college.

189
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:45,175
Longest seven years of my life.

190
00:09:46,892 --> 00:09:49,046
Please, I'm asking you as a friend.

191
00:09:50,711 --> 00:09:53,441
Are you making this
a tier one friendship request?

192
00:09:57,766 --> 00:09:58,555
Fine.

193
00:09:59,112 --> 00:10:00,799
I really appreciate this.

194
00:10:01,318 --> 00:10:03,991
All right, poindexter,
sit down, shut up and listen.

195
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:06,855
I'm sorry?

196
00:10:07,157 --> 00:10:10,442
That's how my father always began
our football conversations.

197
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,521
And if you'd like, after the game,
I'll take you outside

198
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:16,949
and teach you how to shoot close enough
to a raccoon that it craps itself.

199
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,145
When are you going to stop
making Cylon toast?

200
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,517
When I have enough
to destroy all the human toast

201
00:10:46,642 --> 00:10:48,662
on the Battlestar
known as Galactica.

202
00:10:51,441 --> 00:10:53,610
Is that what you're wearing
to watch football at Penny's?

203
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,588
- What's wrong with a football jersey?
- Nothing.

204
00:10:56,713 --> 00:10:59,174
That, however, appears
to be a football cocktail dress.

205
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,598
It's the smallest size they had,
except the one for dogs.

206
00:11:08,226 --> 00:11:10,419
I can't believe
they had one for dogs.

207
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:11,377
Oh, yes.

208
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:14,164
Canine football fans
are a common sight in Texas.

209
00:11:14,402 --> 00:11:16,937
Cats, however,
refuse to wear sporting apparel.

210
00:11:18,729 --> 00:11:20,720
My sister found that out
the hard way.

211
00:11:21,944 --> 00:11:23,254
Anyway, wish me luck.

212
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:26,365
Leonard, wait.
Am I correct in assuming

213
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,619
that your attempt
to be accepted by Penny's peers

214
00:11:29,744 --> 00:11:31,777
is based on your desire to ensure

215
00:11:31,902 --> 00:11:34,068
your continuing mating privileges
with her?

216
00:11:36,582 --> 00:11:38,989
Well, I wouldn't put it
exactly that way.

217
00:11:39,114 --> 00:11:40,239
How would you put it?

218
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:42,967
Like you said.

219
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:48,717
Seems like an awful lot of trouble
to go through for intercourse.

220
00:11:50,425 --> 00:11:53,378
Don't you have access to women
who will do it for money?

221
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:57,830
By the way,

222
00:11:57,955 --> 00:12:00,259
another accepted usage
for the term "ho."

223
00:12:03,397 --> 00:12:04,431
Good-bye, Sheldon.

224
00:12:05,827 --> 00:12:06,641
Hold on.

225
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:10,240
I believe that social convention
dictate you not arrive empty-handed.

226
00:12:10,365 --> 00:12:12,502
Would you like
to bring some Cylon toast?

227
00:12:13,726 --> 00:12:16,440
Yeah, no, I'm trying to fit in,
not get laughed at.

228
00:12:20,968 --> 00:12:22,717
What's funny about Cylon toast?

229
00:12:28,316 --> 00:12:29,280
It's open.

230
00:12:31,178 --> 00:12:32,176
Hey, pal.

231
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:35,705
What do you want?

232
00:12:36,476 --> 00:12:38,006
I brought you a little gift.

233
00:12:38,813 --> 00:12:39,951
New kite.

234
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,845
The kite you made me lose
was an authentic patang,

235
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,705
an Indian fighting kite that my brother
sent to me from New Delhi.

236
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,627
It took me a day to put together
and two days to paint.

237
00:12:51,331 --> 00:12:52,583
This is Hello Kitty.

238
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,657
Yeah, but it comes
with a little coin purse.

239
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:00,872
Does a patang?

240
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,419
You just don't get it, do you?

241
00:13:04,544 --> 00:13:08,453
Buying me something pretty isn't going
to make our problem just go away.

242
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,625
Look, I admit I haven't always been
the best friend I could be.

243
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,331
You've been a sucky friend,
a sucky, sucky friend.

244
00:13:17,414 --> 00:13:19,755
- Stipulated.
- And you do it all the time.

245
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,148
Last week in the mall,

246
00:13:21,273 --> 00:13:24,361
we were looking for a phone
with giant numbers for your mother,

247
00:13:24,486 --> 00:13:26,339
and I suddenly realize
you're not even there.

248
00:13:26,464 --> 00:13:28,223
- I know...
- And where were you?

249
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,932
Getting shot down by the girl
at Hot Dog on a Stick.

250
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,730
But in my defense, she was gorgeous!

251
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,965
And working that squeezer
to make the lemonade,

252
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,390
going up and down and up and down.

253
00:13:40,752 --> 00:13:44,224
It was like a free pole dance
right in the middle of the food court.

254
00:13:45,684 --> 00:13:47,084
You're impossible.

255
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:50,711
At least, I can talk to women
without being drunk.

256
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:54,567
Excuse me, I have selective mutism,
a recognized medical disorder.

257
00:13:55,163 --> 00:13:56,713
You're just a douche.

258
00:13:58,563 --> 00:13:59,664
No. You know what?

259
00:13:59,789 --> 00:14:01,726
Maybe that's what
this whole thing's about.

260
00:14:01,851 --> 00:14:04,092
You're not mad at me,
you're mad at yourself.

261
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:05,474
No, I'm mad at you.

262
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:07,799
I hate myself, but I'm mad at you.

263
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:10,785
Fine. You're mad at me.
I get it.

264
00:14:11,948 --> 00:14:14,060
How about we go
spend the day together?

265
00:14:15,197 --> 00:14:18,062
Just the two of us.
We'll go anywhere you want.

266
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,540
I don't know.

267
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,350
Come on.

268
00:14:23,412 --> 00:14:25,462
Let me take you someplace nice.

269
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,637
I do enjoy the La Brea Tar Pits.

270
00:14:34,537 --> 00:14:37,209
Really, now?
With the traffic and the parking?

271
00:14:37,847 --> 00:14:38,847
Okay, fine.

272
00:14:39,662 --> 00:14:41,129
The Tar Pits. Let's go.

273
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,220
Why can't I stay mad at you?

274
00:14:57,452 --> 00:15:00,310
Are you people watching this?
Is this amazing or what?

275
00:15:01,157 --> 00:15:04,657
Sweetie, that's a highlight
from the '98 championship game.

276
00:15:06,393 --> 00:15:07,793
Did not know that.

277
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:10,408
- How much beer have you had?
- None, why?

278
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:12,869
I was just hoping you were drunk.

279
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,288
- Now we're back live.
- Okay, yeah.

280
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,207
I can see the difference.

281
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:21,447
Oh, where's the flag?
That's intentional grounding.

282
00:15:21,572 --> 00:15:22,572
Totally.

283
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,601
That completely was a forward pass,

284
00:15:24,726 --> 00:15:28,025
which they threw incomplete
to avoid loss of yardage

285
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,650
or to conserve time.

286
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:34,104
I can't believe they're not penalized
with the loss of a down

287
00:15:34,229 --> 00:15:37,475
and by having to move the scrimmage line
back to the spot of the foul.

288
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:44,900
- Here, have some pizza, sweetie.
- You know I'm lactose intolerant.

289
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,195
I know.
I just need you to stop talking.

290
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:55,912
- Sheldon, come in.
- Thank you.

291
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,470
I'd like to make a sandwich,
but I'm out of bread.

292
00:16:00,804 --> 00:16:02,544
There's some in the fridge.

293
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,471
You shouldn't keep it
in the refrigerator.

294
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:07,231
Staleness is caused by crystallization
of the starch molecules,

295
00:16:07,356 --> 00:16:09,726
which occurs faster
at cool temperatures.

296
00:16:09,851 --> 00:16:11,537
On earth, we say "thank you".

297
00:16:14,232 --> 00:16:15,782
How goes the mimesis?

298
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:17,477
"Mimesis"?

299
00:16:17,671 --> 00:16:18,671
You know.

300
00:16:19,123 --> 00:16:20,123
Mimesis.

301
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:24,343
An action in which the mimic
takes on the properties

302
00:16:24,468 --> 00:16:27,036
of a specific object or organism.

303
00:16:27,428 --> 00:16:28,428
Mimesis.

304
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:33,199
What the hell are you talking about?

305
00:16:34,037 --> 00:16:35,905
I'm attempting
to communicate with you

306
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:39,430
without my meaning becoming
apparent to those around you.

307
00:16:40,031 --> 00:16:41,381
Let me try again.

308
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,960
Have the indigenous fauna

309
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:47,218
accepted you as one of their own?

310
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,720
Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.

311
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:53,470
Oh, I guess so.

312
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:54,638
Good.

313
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:55,763
Oh, fyi.

314
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,394
After I eat my sandwich,

315
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,236
I'm taking Koothrappali's
patang kite out for a test run.

316
00:17:00,361 --> 00:17:02,812
Would you like to get
your delta-wing raptor and join me?

317
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,110
I don't want to fly kites, Sheldon.
We're watching football here.

318
00:17:06,802 --> 00:17:09,819
I can see that.
I was providing you with an alternative.

319
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:14,314
A courtesy I was never offered
in similar circumstances.

320
00:17:17,323 --> 00:17:18,473
Look at that.

321
00:17:18,598 --> 00:17:20,482
The Oklahoma coach
has thrown down a red flag,

322
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:23,166
indicating he's challenging
the ruling on the field.

323
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:26,588
I hope he's right, 'cause if he's not,
it'll cost him one of his time-outs.

324
00:17:32,776 --> 00:17:34,526
You know, Leonard, honey,

325
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:38,187
I wouldn't mind if you wanted
to go fly kites with Sheldon.

326
00:17:38,645 --> 00:17:41,434
I'll watch the end of the game.
There's only three minutes left.

327
00:17:41,772 --> 00:17:42,851
Until halftime.

328
00:17:43,088 --> 00:17:44,479
This is just half?

329
00:17:46,051 --> 00:17:49,150
- We've been here for hours.
- You'll be here for a couple more.

330
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,777
- You're kidding me.
- No.

331
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,609
Nice meeting all of you.

332
00:17:55,404 --> 00:17:57,575
So, yeah, anyway,
that's my boyfriend.

333
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,790
He is really smart.

334
00:18:10,387 --> 00:18:12,467
I really like my saber-toothed cat.
Thank you.

335
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,175
My pleasure.

336
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,341
Maybe after lunch,
we can go to Marie Callender's

337
00:18:17,466 --> 00:18:18,847
and have some pie.

338
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:20,306
I'd like that.

339
00:18:23,121 --> 00:18:25,014
This is turning out
to be a perfect Saturday.

340
00:18:25,652 --> 00:18:26,951
Good. I'm glad.

341
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,630
Did you see the way
she smiled at me?

342
00:18:34,394 --> 00:18:35,644
Fine. Go ahead.

343
00:18:36,387 --> 00:18:37,929
No. This is our day.

344
00:18:38,054 --> 00:18:41,004
If you want to chase after her,
chase after her.

345
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,148
Ah, who am I kidding?

346
00:18:43,273 --> 00:18:45,373
I wouldn't have a shot
with a girl like that.

347
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,792
Don't put yourself down.
You're a very attractive man.

348
00:18:48,401 --> 00:18:49,551
You think so?

349
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:53,668
Absolutely. It wouldn't kill you to take
a Pilates class with me now and then,

350
00:18:53,793 --> 00:18:55,520
but you have a certain wiry appeal.

351
00:18:56,229 --> 00:18:59,763
Yeah, well, it doesn't matter
'cause she wasn't really smiling at me.

352
00:19:00,402 --> 00:19:01,723
Actually, I think she was.

353
00:19:02,605 --> 00:19:03,767
- Really?
- Yeah.

354
00:19:07,457 --> 00:19:08,657
What a douche.
