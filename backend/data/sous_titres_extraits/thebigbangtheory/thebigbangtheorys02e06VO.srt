1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,330
******you are considering going into
experimental physics,my door is always open.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,100
Once again,I'm sorry that the
demonstration didn't quite work out,

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:13,840
but now we know what happens when you accidentally
spill Peach Snapple into a helium neon laser.

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,510
Short answer is...don't.

5
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:27,750
And now to tell you about the theoretical
physics department is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,530
- Dr. Cooper?
- Forget it.

7
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,410
Excuse me.

8
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,500
Sheldon,we both agreed to do this.

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,560
It's a waste of time.

10
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,980
I might as well explain the laws of
thermodynamics to a bunch of labradoodles.

11
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,910
If you don't do this,I won't
take you to the comic book store.

12
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,230
Hello.

13
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,560
Nice work with the laser,by the way.

14
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,660
Looking out at your fresh young faces,

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:12,910
I remember when I too was deciding my
academic future as a lowly graduate student.

16
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,840
Of course,I was 14.

17
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:21,120
And I'd already achieved more than most of
you could ever hope to,despite my 9:00 bedtime.

18
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,040
Now,there may be one or
two of you in this room

19
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,690
who has what it takes to
succeed in theoretical physics.

20
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,800
Although,it's more likely that you'll spend
your scientific careers teaching fifth graders

21
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,600
how to make papier mache
volcanoes with baking soda lava.

22
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,840
Oh,good God.

23
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,860
In short-- any
one who told you

24
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,160
that you would someday be able to make
any significant contribution to physics,

25
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,990
played a cruel trick on
you,a cruel trick indeed.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,060
Any questions?

27
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,600
Of course not.

28
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,490
I weep for the future of science.

29
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,040
Now if you'll excuse me,the
latest issue of Batman is out.

30
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,000
Come,Leonard.

31
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,450
Laser demonstration's
looking pretty good now,huh?

35
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,490
I love this time of the year.

36
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,550
The leaves are turning,there's
a bracing chill in the air.

37
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,290
Plus there's a whole new crop of female grad
students about to put on just enough winter weight

38
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,950
to make them needy and vulnerable.

39
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,660
That's right,honey,have another calzone.

40
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,710
Daddy can wait.

41
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,480
Isn't there a university policy
against dating graduate students?

42
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:02,060
No,if you can talk to
them,you can ask them out.

43
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,950
Damn,there's always a catch.

44
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,950
Hey,guys.

45
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,800
Hey,Leslie.

46
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,660
So,dumbass,I heard you made a
grad student throw up last night.

47
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,890
The truth can indeed be a finger down
the throat of those unprepared to hear it.

48
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,340
But why should I cater
to second-rate minds?

49
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,490
Because first-rate
minds call you "dumbass"?

50
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,240
Oh,yeah?Well...

51
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,840
you're a mean person.

52
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,580
Excuse me,Dr. Cooper,I'm
Ramona Nowitzki.

53
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,300
I was at your talk last night.

54
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,980
I think you're just brilliant.

55
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,600
That is the prevailing opinion.

56
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,490
Oh,now I'm gonna throw up.

57
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,370
Howard Wolowitz,department
of engineering,

58
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,970
co-designer of the International Space
Station's Liquid Waste Disposal System.

59
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,470
Dr. Cooper,I've read
everything you've published.

60
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,870
I especially liked your paper on grand
unification using string-network condensates

61
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:02,920
and was wondering how
you determined that

62
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,450
three-dimensional string-nets provided a
unified picture of ferrnions and gauge bosons?

63
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,850
Amazing,an intelligent labradoodle.

64
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,620
Woof.

65
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,600
The fact is I'm quite close
to a breakthrough in showing

66
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,240
how neutrinos emerge from
a string-net condensate.

67
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,890
Oh,my God,that would change the way
we view the entire physical universe.

68
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,100
It's what I do.

69
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,480
You know,the Pishkin-Wolowitz Liquid Waste
Disposal System is turning a few heads as well.

70
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,630
Again,ew.

71
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,740
You know,I'd love to hear more about
how you intend to add neutrinos.

72
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,890
Could we get a cup of coffee sometime?

73
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,130
I don't drink coffee.

74
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,880
I do.I love me a cup of joe.

75
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,500
Well,it doesn't have to be coffee.

76
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,230
How about dinner?

1
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,520
I do eat dinner.

2
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,630
Great. I know a terrific
little Italian place.

3
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,950
I never eat in strange restaurants.

4
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,090
One runs the risk of
non-standard cutlery.

5
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,740
Excuse me?

6
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,450
Sheldon lives in fear
of the three-tined fork.

7
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,560
Three tines is not a fork.

8
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,200
Three tines is a trident.

9
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,310
Forks are for eating,

10
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,340
tridents are for ruling the seven seas.

11
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,770
What if I brought food to your place?

12
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,320
That would be acceptable.

13
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,980
On Mondays,I eat Thai food.

14
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,730
Mee krob and chicken sate with
extra peanut sauce from Siam Palace.

15
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,570
You got it. I already have your address.

16
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,780
What a nice girl.

17
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:37,050
Sheldon,do you have any
idea what just happened?

18
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,320
Yes. Apparently I'm
getting a free dinner.

19
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,450
Oh,yeah,no,this thing's
majorly out of order.

20
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,610
See? Sorry.

21
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,920
That's okay. Guess
I'm taking the stairs.

22
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,840
Where you going?

23
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:53,820
4
- A.

24
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,230
Oh,are you here to see Leonard?

25
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,230
No,Dr. Cooper.

26
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,340
Dr. Sheldon Cooper?

27
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,560
We're having dinner.

28
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,350
Sheldon Cooper?

29
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,540
Tall,thin, looks a little
like a giant praying mantis?

30
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,100
He is cute,isn't he?

31
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,650
Sheldon Cooper?

32
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,440
Hi,Leonard.

33
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,560
Hey,Ramona. Come on in.

34
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,110
Thanks. Where should I put this?

35
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,220
Uh,the kitchen's fine.

36
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,210
Hey,what are you doing?

37
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,180
I need to see this.

38
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,600
The viewing area's right over there.

39
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,660
Sheldon,your girl... date...
person... Ramona's here.

40
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,640
Oh,hello.

41
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,860
Oh,sorry I'm late.

42
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,530
I just got so caught up reading
the draft of your latest paper.

43
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,910
Did you enjoy the humorous footnote
where I illustrate mirror-symmetry

44
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,280
by likening it to the Flash
playing tennis with himself?

45
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,600
So funny.

46
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,430
But the idea that you might
be able to incorporate gravity,

47
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,470
I have to tell you,I found
it physically exhilarating.

48
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,630
My hypotheses tend to have that effect.

49
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,050
I'm sorry I didn't bring
enough for your friends.

50
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,990
I assumed we were going to be alone.

51
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,800
Oh,yeah. No,we were just going.

52
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:21,120
To watch,right?

53
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,050
No,come on,now, we're going out.

54
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,950
Oh,come on, we'll be quiet.

55
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,800
Let's go,let's go.

56
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,730
Okay,you two. Have a nice...

57
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,630
whatever this is.

58
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,780
Okay,you guys,look, I know
this is none of my business,

59
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:46,270
but I just... I have to
ask-- what's Sheldon's deal?

60
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,650
What do you mean "deal"?

61
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,690
You know,like what's his deal?

62
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,230
Is it girls...?
Guys...? Sock puppets...?

63
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:01,050
Honestly,we've been operating under
the assumption that he has no deal.

64
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,110
Come on,everybody has a deal.

65
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,120
Not Sheldon.

66
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,800
Over the years,we've formulated many
theories about how he might reproduce.

67
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:13,040
I'm an advocate of mitosis.

68
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,830
I'm sorry?

69
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,560
I believe one day Sheldon will
eat an enormous amount of Thai food

70
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,670
and split into two Sheldons.

71
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,630
On the other hand, I think Sheldon
might be the larval form of his species,

72
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,670
and someday he'll spin a cocoon and emerge two
months later with moth wings and an exoskeleton.

73
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,050
Okay,well,thanks for the nightmares.

74
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,760
Hey,do you want to hang out with us?

75
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,440
What are you guys gonna do?

76
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,740
My mom's making a brisket tonight.

77
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,020
The one with the little onions?

78
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,500
Yeah,I'm busy,so... Good night.

79
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,570
Her loss. Let's go.

80
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,450
Brisket party! B-
to-the-R-to-the-I-S-K...

81
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,800

To-the-E-to-the-T...Ooh...

82
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,160
Don't.

83
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,570
Hey,aren't you having breakfast?

84
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,470
Yes.

85
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,890
Are you experimenting with
nutritional suppositories again?

86
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,110
Not in these pants.

87
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,250
So... how'd it go
with Ramona last night?

88
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:35,020
Oh,great. She's smart,insightful

89
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:39,230
and she has a very unique
way of,you know,revering me.

90
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,120
Here's your spinach mushroom omelet.

91
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,480
Thank you.

92
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,610
Did anyone touch it?

93
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,260
Gloves were worn by everyone involved.

94
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,430
I was vigilant.

95
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,170
Ramona pointed out that I've been wasting
20 minutes a day standing on cafeteria lines.

96
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,520
Time which would be better spent tackling
the great physics problems of our day.

97
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,770
You don't tackle the big issues,Ramona.

98
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,090
You fence with them.

99
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,000
En garde. Riposte.

100
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,940
Touche.

101
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,130
- Morning.
- Hi,Leslie.

102
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,160
So,Sheldon, I see you're
organizing your papers

103
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,930
for the Smithsonian
Museum of Dumbassery.

104
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:25,140
There won't be any room until they get
rid of the permanent Leslie Winkle exhibit.

105
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,720
Oh,good one.

106
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,310
I see you got a grad student
to fight your battles for you.

107
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,500
I'll let you keep
your lunch money today.

108
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,040
Okay,Dr. Cooper is on the
verge of a breakthrough.

109
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,200
If you're going to stay,

110
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:41,810
you'll have to be respectful and quiet.

111
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,540
Wait for me.

112
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,400
So have you worked
out the neutrino issue?

113
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,720
Well,to paraphrase Mozart,

114
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,370
all the subatomic particles are there.

115
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,200
I just have to put
them in the right order.

116
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,220
You're so witty.

117
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,510
Aren't I?

118
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,650
Hey,guys, this package came for...

119
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,310
Dr. Cooper is working.

120
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,930
Yes,I'm close to a breakthrough.

121
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,600
Ooh,it tickles!

122
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,050
Sorry.

123
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,570
Holy crap on a cracker.

124
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,200
Hey,Penny.

125
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,970
Hi. You probably don't
want to go in there.

126
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,600
Why? What are they doing?

127
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:44,130
The only way I could explain it would
be in a therapist's office with dolls.

128
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,060
Hoo-boy.

129
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,460
Dr. Cooper's working.

130
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,890
Yeah,I can see that.

131
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,800
Sheldon,Halonight,
Koothrappali's. You coming?

132
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,560
Oh,yes,it'sHalonight.

133
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,060
Let me just dry my tootsies.

134
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,460
You're not going toHalonight.

135
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,110
Yes,I am. It's Wednesday.
Wednesday'sHalonight.

136
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,800
Didn't a great man once say, "Science
demands nothing less than the fervent

137
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:21,220
"and unconditional dedication
of our entire lives"?

138
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,430
He did.

139
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,770
And who was that great man?

140
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,750
Me.

141
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,360
Sorry,Leonard.

142
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,920
Seriously? You're not coming?

143
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,960
You heard her. How can I argue with me?

144
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,190
Okay,well,once again,
you guys have a good...

145
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,560
whatever this is.

1
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:47,410
Dr. Cooper, I have to tell you
your friends are holding you back.

2
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:50,840
I prefer to think of it as
"I'm pulling them forward."

3
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,030
Halo night?

4
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:57,650
A man with your intellectual gifts doesn't
waste an evening playing video games.

5
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,910
He does on Wednesdays.

6
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,800
Not if he wants a Nobel Prize.

7
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,460
He does want that.

8
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,820
Does a man with my intellectual
gifts play paintball on weekends?

9
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,180
What do you think?

10
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,050
Drat.

11
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,150
Now shall we get back to work?

12
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,530
I suppose.

13
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:25,420
Battlestar Galactica comes on tonight.

14
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,330
I guess I can wait for the DVD.

15
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,660
And then never ever watch it.

16
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,580
* You can be my Yoko Ono  *

17
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,470
* You can follow me wherever I go *

18
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,330
* Be my, be my, be
my Yoko Ono, whoa-oa *

19
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,110
* Now that I'm far away *

20
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,690
* It doesn't seem to
me to be such a pain *

21
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,040
* To have you hanging off my ankle *

22
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:10,000
* Like some kind of ball and chain *

23
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,050
* You can be my Yoko Ono *

24
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:21,030
* You can follow me wherever I go *

25
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,000
* You can be my
Yoko Ono Whoa-oa-oa *

26
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,990
* You can follow me wherever I go *

27
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,620
Penny! Penny! Penny!

28
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,510
Sheldon, honey, I've told
you, it's a small apartment.

29
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,800
You only have to knock one time.

30
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,140
Please, please, I don't
have a lot of time.

31
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:43,400
Look, Ramona finally dozed off, and
I need you to help me get rid of her.

32
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,090
Get rid of her how?

33
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,970
I don't know, but apparently
I'm in some kind of relationship,

34
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,900
and you seem to be an
expert at ending them.

35
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,590
Excuse me?

36
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:04,470
I see man after man leaving
this apartment never to return.

37
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,910
Okay, first of all, it
is not man after man.

38
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,050
- Dr. Cooper?
- Hide me.

39
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,470
Hide you?

40
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,180
I formally request sanctuary.

41
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,230
Why aren't you working?

42
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,130
she distracted me.

43
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,910
I told you, Penny, I don't
have time for your nonsense.

44
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,540
I have important things to do.

45
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,000
Oh, man.

46
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,510
I know what's going on here.

47
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,450
Really? Well, then will
you explain it to me?

48
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,420
You're in love with Dr. Cooper.

49
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,660
Uh, yeah, no, that's not it.

50
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,030
Don't try to deny it.

51
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:47,690
He's a remarkable man,
but you have to let him go.

52
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,500
Oh, gee, okay.

53
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:55,570
I know it's hard, but he's a gift to
the whole world, and we can't be selfish.

54
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,380
Yeah, he's a gift all right.

55
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,910
Sisters?

56
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,750
Uh, sure. Sisters.

57
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,200
Holy crap on a cracker.

58
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,610
Sheldon?

59
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,090
What are you doing?

60
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,390
It's Morse code.

61
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,690
Why?

62
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,880
So we can communicate through the wall.

63
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,510
We are communicating through the wall.

64
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,840
Yes, but the communication
is not encrypted.

65
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,230
I don't know Morse code.

66
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,550
It's very simple. This is A ...

67
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,010
This is B ... This is C...

68
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,150
Sheldon, I'm not going to learn
Morse code at 3:00 in the morning!

69
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,570
All right.

70
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,130
Don't come in here, don't come in
here, don't come in here, don't...

71
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,700
What's going on?

72
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,390
Ramona's sleeping on the couch.

73
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,580
I know. When is she going home?

74
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,980
Never. That's the problem.

75
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,560
I need your help.

76
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,180
What are you talking about?

77
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:21,100
I'm invoking the Skynet clause
of our friendship agreement.

78
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:24,790
That only applies if you need me to help
you destroy an artificial intelligence

79
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,740
you've created that's
taking over the Earth.

80
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:30,390
Come on! Don't nitpick!

81
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,720
Good night.

82
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,560
All right.

83
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,540
I'm invoking our Body Snatchers clause.

84
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,800
The Body Snatchers clause requires
me to help you destroy someone we know

85
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,800
who's been replaced with an alien pod.

86
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:46,880
Yes. She's in the living
room. Go. I'll wait here.

87
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,410
Sheldon, what are you doing out of bed?

88
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,830
Now! Do it!

89
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:57,790
You know you need your sleep in order for your
cognitive processing to perform at optimum levels.

90
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,050
Now come on.

91
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,240
Godzilla clause?

92
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,200
Not unless she destroys Tokyo.

93
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,400
Rats.

94
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,960
I've got it!

95
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:14,690
I finally reconciled the black hole information
paradox with my theory of string-network condensates!

96
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,430
It's unbelievable!
It's paradigm-altering.

97
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,140
And I could not have
done it without you.

98
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,480
Oh, please, I just offered
a little encouragement.

99
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,260
It was a lot more than that.

100
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:27,800
You helped me work out the masses of all
the fermions and you pumiced my hammer toe.

101
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,800
How can I ever repay you?

102
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:34,370
Well, would you consider naming
it the Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem?

103
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,940
Who's Nowitzki?

104
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,900
I'm Nowitzki.

105
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:42,350
Oh, you want me to share credit?

106
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,530
Get out!

107
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,770
Oh, bite me!

108
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,740
Sisters?

109
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,010
Excuse me, Dr. Cooper.

110
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,420
I'm Kathy O'Brien.

111
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:04,230
I just finished reading your paper
reconciling the black hole information paradox

112
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,910
with your theory of string
- network condensates, and it just took my breath away.

113
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,000
Maybe when I publish it,
I'll include an inhaler.

114
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:20,040
Would you possibly have any
time for me to pick your brain?

115
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,310
Let's see. Today's Thursday.

116
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,300
Thursday nights, I eat
pizza from Giacomo's.

117
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,280
Sausage, mushrooms, light olives.

118
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:29,790
Great. I'll bring it to your
place. I have the address.

119
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,870
What a nice girl.

120
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,450
Sheldon, do you see
what just happened here?

121
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,800
Yes, I'm getting a free pizza.

122
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,820
I'm on a roll.

123
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,400
More pad Thai, please.

124
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,590
Sheldon, you've already
had four servings.

125
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,060
You might want to
slow down a bit, buddy.

126
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,520
Just one more bite.

127
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,290
Sheldon?

128
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,280
Sheldon, are you okay?

129
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:13,470
I'm just so... full.

130
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,930
