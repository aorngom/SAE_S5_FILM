1
00:00:01,525 --> 00:00:02,587
You're wrong.

2
00:00:02,712 --> 00:00:05,203
Wolverine was not born
with bone claws.

3
00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:07,517
You know me to be a very smart man.

4
00:00:07,642 --> 00:00:10,388
Don't you think
if I were wrong, I'd know it?

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,343
- First of all...
- Give it up, dude.

6
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:15,295
You're arguing with a crazy person.

7
00:00:16,274 --> 00:00:18,935
I'm not crazy.
My mother had me tested.

8
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:24,273
- What are you doing here?
- What? It's new comic book night.

9
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:26,074
Since you and Penny
finally hooked up,

10
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:29,599
we thought you two would be having
bouncy naked yum-yum night.

11
00:00:30,987 --> 00:00:32,782
There's more to life than sex, Raj.

12
00:00:32,951 --> 00:00:35,275
Who had "Leonard flames out with Penny
in less than 24 hours"?

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,400
I did.

14
00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:38,836
Nothing flamed out.

15
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:40,873
We don't have to have sex
every night, you know.

16
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,887
You don't have to,
but it's highly recommended.

17
00:00:44,965 --> 00:00:47,140
Yeah, take advantage
of that window of opportunity

18
00:00:47,265 --> 00:00:49,612
before it slams shut
on your little dinky.

19
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,412
It's not a matter of opportunity.

20
00:00:52,537 --> 00:00:55,304
We're getting to know each other.
There's a learning curve.

21
00:00:55,473 --> 00:00:57,903
What's there to learn?
You get naked, do nasty things,

22
00:00:58,028 --> 00:00:59,913
then somebody
makes scrambled eggs and salami.

23
00:01:00,038 --> 00:01:01,060
Easy peasy.

24
00:01:01,901 --> 00:01:04,105
Perhaps what Leonard
is oblique referring to

25
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,482
is the occurrence of some sort
of sexual dysfunction.

26
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,280
Who had
"Leonard gets a floppy disk"?

27
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,440
A clever...
albeit obsolete, euphemism

28
00:01:12,565 --> 00:01:15,108
for insufficient blood flow
the male sex organ.

29
00:01:17,594 --> 00:01:19,399
Nothing like that happened,
all right?

30
00:01:19,524 --> 00:01:21,539
The sex was... just fine.

31
00:01:22,157 --> 00:01:23,502
Just fine?

32
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,750
Dude, the fourth Harry Potter movie
was "just fine. "

33
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,530
I'm not saying it was bad.

34
00:01:29,655 --> 00:01:32,206
I'm just saying it...
wasn't great.

35
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,133
Do you mean for both of you?

36
00:01:34,258 --> 00:01:36,354
Because we can totally see it
not being great for her.

37
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,479
Oh, yeah.

38
00:01:38,718 --> 00:01:42,017
To tell you the truth,
I think we were both... I don't know...

39
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,413
Disappointed? Let down?

40
00:01:43,538 --> 00:01:45,246
Ashamed? Horrified? Repulsed?

41
00:01:46,157 --> 00:01:48,816
All I know is, it wasn't the way
I dreamed it would be.

42
00:01:49,656 --> 00:01:52,356
Sex is never
the way I dream it's gonna be.

43
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,557
That's because in your dreams,
you're a horse from the waist down.

44
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:02,288
Excuse me, <i>Wolverine: Origin. </i>

45
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,159
Miniseries issue two, page 22.

46
00:02:05,284 --> 00:02:07,378
Retractable bone claws.

47
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:09,523
If you people spent less time
thinking about sex

48
00:02:09,648 --> 00:02:11,572
and more time concentrating
on comic books,

49
00:02:11,697 --> 00:02:13,674
we'd have far fewer
of these embarrassing moments.

50
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,221
Episode 302: The Jiminy Conjecture

51
00:02:20,805 --> 00:02:22,612
Sync: Jess, Golgi, Loky

52
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,277
www.subbercafe.fr

53
00:02:41,415 --> 00:02:42,923
Sheldon, dinner's here.

54
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:44,527
Tandoori Palace?

55
00:02:44,652 --> 00:02:46,082
No, we went somewhere new.

56
00:02:49,952 --> 00:02:52,420
You're good naturedly ribbing me,
aren't you?

57
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:54,548
No, look, Mumbai Palace.

58
00:02:54,826 --> 00:02:55,918
Why?

59
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,399
Why would we change?

60
00:02:57,524 --> 00:03:00,979
We had a perfectly good palace.
Tandoori Palace is our palace.

61
00:03:02,302 --> 00:03:04,441
Trust me, this will be just fine.

62
00:03:04,855 --> 00:03:07,531
You <i>are</i> the authority
on "just fine. "

63
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:11,410
What's that supposed to mean?

64
00:03:12,202 --> 00:03:14,941
Yeah, exactly.
"Not bad, but not great".

65
00:03:17,602 --> 00:03:19,527
- What are they talking about?
- I don't know.

66
00:03:19,652 --> 00:03:21,450
I know.
As I'm sure you're aware...

67
00:03:23,728 --> 00:03:25,913
If that's Morse code,
that's terrible.

68
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,125
As I was saying, you and Leonard had
a disappointing sexual encounter.

69
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:33,417
Earlier this evening,
Leonard characterized it as "just fine."

70
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,775
So you're seeing a continuation
of the mocking that followed.

71
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,794
Okay, yeah, I'm just gonna go
eat my dinner elsewhere.

72
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:45,669
Maybe an airplane
headed for a mountainside.

73
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:47,769
Penny, wait.

74
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,446
What is wrong with you?

75
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:57,933
I sense I may have crossed
some sort of line.

76
00:03:59,421 --> 00:04:01,571
- Yeah, you...
- No, don't tell him.

77
00:04:01,952 --> 00:04:04,122
Let's see if he can figure it out.

78
00:04:09,794 --> 00:04:12,126
- I am so embarrassed!
- Please don't be mad.

79
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,291
- What did you tell them?
- Nothing bad.

80
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,255
Just that last night was fine.

81
00:04:16,544 --> 00:04:18,632
Fine? You said it was fine?

82
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,610
Yeah, it's a perfectly good word.

83
00:04:20,735 --> 00:04:22,797
You put it in front
of "wine" or "dining,"

84
00:04:22,922 --> 00:04:25,013
and you've really got something.

85
00:04:28,797 --> 00:04:30,897
Okay, well, let me ask you this:

86
00:04:31,612 --> 00:04:33,147
how was last night for you?

87
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:36,698
It was... okay.

88
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:38,733
Okay?

89
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:41,297
Yeah, it's a perfectly good word.

90
00:04:41,422 --> 00:04:43,359
I mean,
you put it in front of "dokay"

91
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:45,284
and you really got something.

92
00:04:46,737 --> 00:04:48,247
All right, let's not overreact.

93
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:51,242
For a lot of couples, it takes time
to get to know each other's rhythms.

94
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:53,334
Learn what the other person
wants and likes.

95
00:04:53,797 --> 00:04:55,336
So, you've been through this before?

96
00:04:58,861 --> 00:05:00,155
Okay-dokay.

97
00:05:02,361 --> 00:05:03,831
I think it's one of those things

98
00:05:03,956 --> 00:05:05,930
where talking about it
isn't gonna make it better.

99
00:05:06,361 --> 00:05:08,359
- Want a glass of wine?
- So much.

100
00:05:09,793 --> 00:05:11,842
See, we should've
done this last night.

101
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:14,146
Have a little wine,
take the edge off.

102
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:18,042
Actually, ethyl alcohol inhibits
electrical conduction in the nerve cells

103
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:21,612
and stimulates reuptake receptors
of inhibitory neurotramitters

104
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:23,582
like gamma-aminobutyric acid.

105
00:05:27,864 --> 00:05:29,678
Don't talk, just drink.

106
00:05:32,622 --> 00:05:34,117
No, you're misunderstanding.

107
00:05:34,242 --> 00:05:36,842
A Shiksa Goddess
isn't an actual goddess.

108
00:05:38,678 --> 00:05:40,117
And we don't pray <i>to</i> them.

109
00:05:40,242 --> 00:05:41,542
We prey <i>on</i> them.

110
00:05:43,581 --> 00:05:46,688
Whatever, dude. The point is,
Leonard's got one and you don't.

111
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:48,804
Is this it?

112
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,005
It was inappropriate to discuss
Leonard and Penny's sex life

113
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,602
in front of Leonard and Penny.

114
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,237
Good!

115
00:05:59,027 --> 00:06:00,345
Now I can eat.

116
00:06:07,118 --> 00:06:07,992
What's that?

117
00:06:08,491 --> 00:06:10,791
- Sounds like a cricket.
- Hang on.

118
00:06:15,243 --> 00:06:17,990
Based on the number of chirps per minute
and the ambient temperature,

119
00:06:18,115 --> 00:06:19,965
it is a snowy tree cricket.

120
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,553
Give me a freakin' break.

121
00:06:23,678 --> 00:06:25,681
How could you possibly know that?

122
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,511
In 1890, Emile Dolbear

123
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,357
determined
that there was a relationship

124
00:06:29,482 --> 00:06:31,901
between the number of chirps per minute
of the snowy tree cricket

125
00:06:32,026 --> 00:06:33,205
and the temperature.

126
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,596
A precise relationship that is not
present with ordinary field crickets.

127
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:39,356
How do you know what the exact
temperature of the room is?

128
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,258
Under the terms
of my roommate agreement,

129
00:06:41,383 --> 00:06:43,247
I've had unilateral control
of the thermostat

130
00:06:43,372 --> 00:06:45,242
ever since the sweaty night of '06.

131
00:06:47,335 --> 00:06:50,250
You were right
about Wolverine and bone claws,

132
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,215
but you're wrong about the cricket.

133
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,166
Howard, don't embarrass yourself.

134
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,167
The science chirps for itself.

135
00:06:57,728 --> 00:06:59,238
Humorous word play.

136
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:03,172
No, no, not this time.
I know insects, my friend.

137
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:06,289
I spent many childhood years
capturing them with nets,

138
00:07:06,414 --> 00:07:08,529
putting them in glass jars,
sticking pins through them,

139
00:07:08,654 --> 00:07:11,096
mounting them on corrugated
cardboard with Dymo labels underneath,

140
00:07:11,221 --> 00:07:13,581
identifying the genus and species.

141
00:07:14,562 --> 00:07:15,562
In Latin.

142
00:07:18,654 --> 00:07:21,454
Dude, you are never getting
a shiksa goddess.

143
00:07:25,398 --> 00:07:27,167
That is a snowy tree cricket.

144
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:28,530
<i>Oecanthus fultoni. </i>

145
00:07:28,901 --> 00:07:31,301
I was done with Latin
by fifth grade.

146
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,528
Okay, tell you what.

147
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,663
I am willing to bet anything
that's an ordinary field cricket.

148
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,747
I can't take your money.

149
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,459
You chicken?

150
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,337
I've always found that
an inappropriate slur.

151
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,549
Chickens are not, by nature,
at all timid.

152
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:48,734
In fact, when I was young,
my neighbor's chicken got loose

153
00:07:48,859 --> 00:07:51,720
and chased me up the big elm tree
in front of our house.

154
00:07:54,426 --> 00:07:56,642
- Chickens can't climb trees.
- Thank God.

155
00:08:00,233 --> 00:08:02,064
I believe a chicken
made you his bitch.

156
00:08:04,136 --> 00:08:06,402
But the cricket thing, I don't buy.
Bet me.

157
00:08:07,465 --> 00:08:08,565
Fair enough.

158
00:08:08,924 --> 00:08:10,956
What stakes do you propose?

159
00:08:12,402 --> 00:08:14,971
I will put up my
<i>Fantastic Four</i> number 48,

160
00:08:15,096 --> 00:08:17,048
first appearance of Silver Surfer

161
00:08:17,173 --> 00:08:20,833
against your <i>Flash</i> 123,
the classic <i>Flash</i> of two worlds issue.

162
00:08:22,361 --> 00:08:23,961
All right, you have a wager.

163
00:08:25,857 --> 00:08:28,208
Great.
Now how are you going to settle it?

164
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:31,593
There is no way to determine the species
of the cricket without examining it.

165
00:08:40,898 --> 00:08:43,730
I wonder what the non-pathetic people
are doing tonight.

166
00:08:56,612 --> 00:08:58,062
- More wine?
- Hit me.

167
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:06,217
I don't see anything.

168
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:13,876
Hallway.

169
00:09:18,656 --> 00:09:19,856
One at a time.

170
00:09:32,928 --> 00:09:34,128
What was that?

171
00:09:34,614 --> 00:09:35,614
My stomach.

172
00:09:36,915 --> 00:09:38,410
Indian food doesn't agree with me.

173
00:09:41,677 --> 00:09:42,831
Ironic, isn't it?

174
00:09:47,428 --> 00:09:48,678
Elevator shaft.

175
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,468
Help me open it.

176
00:09:54,822 --> 00:09:58,013
Are you crazy? We can't go down
an empty elevator shaft.

177
00:09:58,305 --> 00:10:00,973
Fine, if you don't want to proceed,
then you forfeit the bet,

178
00:10:01,098 --> 00:10:03,101
and I'll take possession
of your Fantastic Four.

179
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:06,329
Let's open her up.

180
00:10:07,906 --> 00:10:10,750
Are you bothered
that I can so easily manipulate you?

181
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:11,985
Don't push me.

182
00:10:13,015 --> 00:10:15,747
I may be small,
but I took kung fu when I was 13,

183
00:10:15,872 --> 00:10:18,022
and I remember a good deal of it.

184
00:10:18,656 --> 00:10:19,747
Oh, really?

185
00:10:19,872 --> 00:10:22,955
I grew up with an older brother
and a very contentious twin sister.

186
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,037
And I believe I could easily best you
in any physical confrontation...

187
00:10:26,162 --> 00:10:29,753
be it noogies, swirlies or the classic
"Why are you hitting yourself?"

188
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:36,051
Big talk from a man
who was once treed by a chicken.

189
00:10:45,435 --> 00:10:46,979
What are we drinking now?

190
00:10:47,374 --> 00:10:48,874
Peppermint schnapps.

191
00:10:51,099 --> 00:10:53,151
Why would you buy
peppermint schnapps?

192
00:10:53,371 --> 00:10:55,171
Because I like peppermint,

193
00:10:55,311 --> 00:10:57,261
and it's fun to say schnapps.

194
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:03,036
- Hey, Leonard?
- What?

195
00:11:03,364 --> 00:11:04,500
Schnapps.

196
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:07,875
Schnapps.

197
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:10,321
You're right, that is fun.

198
00:11:13,562 --> 00:11:14,658
Be careful.

199
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:16,687
If I were not being careful,

200
00:11:16,812 --> 00:11:19,428
your telling me to be careful
would not make me careful.

201
00:11:24,688 --> 00:11:25,688
Stairwell.

202
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:30,453
Flashlight went out.
I need some batteries.

203
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Fellas?

204
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:36,567
Hello?

205
00:11:39,438 --> 00:11:41,288
It's really dark down here.

206
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:48,073
Oh, sweetie.

207
00:11:48,198 --> 00:11:51,596
You really can't hold
your liquor, can you?

208
00:11:52,798 --> 00:11:53,880
I'm okay.

209
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:57,901
Just a little mouthwash,
and then I'm gonna rock your world.

210
00:12:04,883 --> 00:12:06,033
Are you okay?

211
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,660
Toby, what did you do in a past life
to be so disgusting now?

212
00:12:19,128 --> 00:12:20,655
His name isn't Toby.

213
00:12:21,002 --> 00:12:22,949
Toby is an absurd name
for a cricket.

214
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,789
- What would you name him?
- An appropriate cricket name.

215
00:12:25,914 --> 00:12:27,414
For example, Jiminy.

216
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:30,917
All right, here we go.

217
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,377
<i>Kleingast's Field Guide
to North American Insects. </i>

218
00:12:36,462 --> 00:12:38,632
Right here. See it?

219
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,037
The common field cricket,
AKA <i>Gryllus assimilis,</i>

220
00:12:41,162 --> 00:12:43,712
which is Latin
for "suck it, you lose. "

221
00:12:44,038 --> 00:12:45,038
Hang on.

222
00:12:46,476 --> 00:12:47,292
<i>Voilà.</i>

223
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:50,664
The snowy tree cricket.
AKA <i>Oecanthus fultoni,</i>

224
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:52,896
which is Latin
for I'll suck nothing.

225
00:12:53,683 --> 00:12:56,900
Of course I'm joking because the Latin
for that is <i>nihil exsorbibo. </i>

226
00:12:57,397 --> 00:12:59,084
That is not Toby,

227
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:00,529
this is Toby.

228
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,239
Raj, what do you think?

229
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,075
I really don't care anymore.

230
00:13:07,582 --> 00:13:10,497
- God, I had the most horrible night.
- What happened?

231
00:13:10,782 --> 00:13:13,892
Obviously another carnal fiasco
with the shiksi goddess.

232
00:13:15,236 --> 00:13:16,336
Shiksa. Shik-sa.

233
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,959
Forgive me.
Yiddish was not spoken in east Texas.

234
00:13:20,955 --> 00:13:23,555
And if it was,
it wasn't spoken for long.

235
00:13:24,308 --> 00:13:27,055
Yeah, fine, whatever.
The point is, you're wrong again.

236
00:13:27,334 --> 00:13:29,516
We haven't established
that I'm wrong once. All right.

237
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:32,398
Let's go down
to the Entomology Department

238
00:13:32,523 --> 00:13:35,480
and let Professor Crawley tell us
what kind of cricket Toby is.

239
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,483
He's a snowy tree cricket,
and his name is Jiminy.

240
00:13:40,071 --> 00:13:43,947
I bet I could throw a rock in this room
and come up with three better friends.

241
00:13:52,054 --> 00:13:53,375
Holy crap.

242
00:13:58,282 --> 00:14:01,032
It's like
<i>The silence of the lambsdown</i> here.

243
00:14:06,476 --> 00:14:07,679
Don't do that!

244
00:14:09,001 --> 00:14:10,765
You're such a girl.
They're just bugs.

245
00:14:11,223 --> 00:14:13,558
Well, I don't like bugs, okay?
They freak me out.

246
00:14:13,683 --> 00:14:17,063
Interesting. You're afraid of
insects and women.

247
00:14:17,407 --> 00:14:19,657
Ladybugs must render you catatonic.

248
00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:24,139
It was a joke.

249
00:14:25,594 --> 00:14:27,657
I made it to lessen your discomfort.

250
00:14:29,181 --> 00:14:30,285
You're welcome.

251
00:14:36,183 --> 00:14:38,155
Don't knock. Just walk in.

252
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,980
Why be polite to the world's
leading expert on the dung beetle?

253
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:46,301
Excuse me,
are you professor Crawley?

254
00:14:47,032 --> 00:14:48,386
Who wants to know?

255
00:14:49,718 --> 00:14:51,848
I'm Dr. Cooper
from the physics department.

256
00:14:52,156 --> 00:14:53,391
Couldn't wait, huh?

257
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:56,114
- I'm sorry?
- I haven't even packed yet,

258
00:14:56,239 --> 00:14:58,516
and you're already measuring my lab

259
00:14:58,641 --> 00:15:01,141
for one of your godless
laser machines.

260
00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:06,029
No, you don't understand.
We just want to ask you a question.

261
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:08,929
Let me ask you one first.

262
00:15:09,282 --> 00:15:12,218
What's a world renowned entomologist
with a doctorate

263
00:15:12,343 --> 00:15:15,312
and 20 years of experience
to do with his life

264
00:15:15,437 --> 00:15:18,833
when the university cuts off
the funding for his lab, huh?

265
00:15:19,672 --> 00:15:22,695
Ask rhetorical questions
that make people uncomfortable?

266
00:15:27,036 --> 00:15:28,218
What's your deal?

267
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:31,879
Are they planning
to outsource my job to Bangalore?

268
00:15:34,592 --> 00:15:35,976
I'm from New Delhi.

269
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:39,807
- You should find another entomologist.
- No. We're here. Let's settle this.

270
00:15:39,932 --> 00:15:42,566
Professor, can you identify
our cricket?

271
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,005
Of course I can.

272
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:47,696
I can identify every insect
and arachnid on the planet.

273
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:52,314
Not that that's going to keep me from
moving in with my daughter in Oxnard.

274
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,496
And we're not talking
Oxnard at the beach. No!

275
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:59,933
We're talking Oxnard
in the onion fields.

276
00:16:04,762 --> 00:16:06,047
Could you look at Toby?

277
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,507
Toby?

278
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,411
What a stupid name for a cricket.

279
00:16:13,177 --> 00:16:14,180
Told ya.

280
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:19,477
- It's a field cricket.
- No, wait. Dr. Crawley, are you sure?

281
00:16:19,747 --> 00:16:23,273
Young man, I've been studying insects
since I was eight years old.

282
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:26,066
You know what they used
to call me in school?

283
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,873
Creepy Crawley.

284
00:16:29,326 --> 00:16:32,115
Cruel as that may be,
that is not in itself a credential.

285
00:16:34,249 --> 00:16:36,049
Let me show you something.

286
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:39,331
See that?
That's a Crawley's dung beetle.

287
00:16:39,685 --> 00:16:42,185
I discovered it after spending
six months slogging

288
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,002
through the Bornean rain forest,

289
00:16:44,748 --> 00:16:46,546
while my wife was back home

290
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,278
shacking up
with a two-bit ornithologist

291
00:16:49,403 --> 00:16:51,053
who lives on a sailboat

292
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:53,511
and likes to wear boot-cut jeans!

293
00:16:55,378 --> 00:16:57,026
So, when I tell you

294
00:16:57,151 --> 00:16:59,776
that that's a common field cricket,

295
00:16:59,901 --> 00:17:02,145
you can take that to the damn bank!

296
00:17:02,493 --> 00:17:03,938
Cause God knows I can't!

297
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,691
That tramp took me for everything!

298
00:17:12,937 --> 00:17:14,937
Well, apparently, I was wrong.

299
00:17:16,283 --> 00:17:17,583
Congratulations.

300
00:17:23,962 --> 00:17:25,001
Enjoy Oxnard.

301
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,422
I'm sure your daughter's
looking forward to having you.

302
00:17:38,085 --> 00:17:39,641
What you got?
A new comic book?

303
00:17:39,814 --> 00:17:41,187
Old comic book.

304
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,940
I just retrieved it
from my safe deposit box.

305
00:17:45,901 --> 00:17:47,816
What do you have
a safe deposit box for?

306
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,201
Old comic books.

307
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:55,208
I lost this to Wolowitz
in an ill-considered cricket wager.

308
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:58,576
What, do they have Wii cricket now?

309
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,096
That can't be very popular.

310
00:18:03,032 --> 00:18:04,416
I'd rather not talk about it.

311
00:18:04,726 --> 00:18:07,544
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I'm not feeling so hot either.

312
00:18:09,274 --> 00:18:11,172
Why would that make me feel better?

313
00:18:12,463 --> 00:18:13,717
I don't know, empathy?

314
00:18:18,493 --> 00:18:19,775
Anyway, I'm just saying,

315
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,199
that you're feeling upset
about something with Howard,

316
00:18:22,324 --> 00:18:23,685
and me, with Leonard.

317
00:18:24,011 --> 00:18:25,854
Yes, the disappointing sex.

318
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,592
That's an inexact parallel.

319
00:18:28,717 --> 00:18:31,192
You and Leonard can always return
to being friends,

320
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:33,273
whereas I can never return
to a state

321
00:18:33,398 --> 00:18:36,644
in which Wolowitz has not bested me
like Mrs. Riley's chicken.

322
00:18:38,091 --> 00:18:39,701
What's Mrs. Riley's chicken?

323
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,370
A chicken that was owned
by Mrs. Riley.

324
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,875
- Okay, forget the chicken.
- I wish I could.

325
00:18:49,536 --> 00:18:51,504
You may be right
about me and Leonard.

326
00:18:51,804 --> 00:18:53,023
Of course I'm right.

327
00:18:53,148 --> 00:18:55,675
What are the odds
I'd be wrong twice in one week?

328
00:18:56,304 --> 00:18:58,619
No, I mean, we can always go back
to being friends.

329
00:18:58,744 --> 00:19:00,040
I just said that.

330
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:02,557
This conversation has started to circle.
Meeting adjourned.

331
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:11,415
What's going on?

332
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,760
You'd like to catch up
on the events of the day. All right.

333
00:19:16,552 --> 00:19:19,489
There was a half-hour wait at the bank
to get into my safe deposit box,

334
00:19:19,614 --> 00:19:22,118
I was forced to talk to Penny
about your sexual problems,

335
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,578
and, oh, yes,

336
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,718
in a moment filled
with biblical resonance,

337
00:19:25,843 --> 00:19:27,616
pride wenteth before my fall,

338
00:19:27,741 --> 00:19:30,535
causing my Flash 123
to goeth to Wolowitz.

339
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:35,298
Wait a minute.
You talked to Penny about our sex life?

340
00:19:35,543 --> 00:19:37,115
Leonard, it astonishes me

341
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,181
how you continually fixate
on the trivial.

342
00:19:39,306 --> 00:19:41,056
I lost a bet to Wolowitz.

343
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,891
Right. You're saying
you talked to Penny?

344
00:19:46,505 --> 00:19:48,255
- Interesting.
- Hardly.

345
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,060
Excuse me.

346
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,439
- Have I crossed a line again?
- Little bit.

347
00:20:01,364 --> 00:20:02,364
Who cares?

348
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,501
What did Sheldon say to you?

349
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:12,799
Not a lot.

350
00:20:12,924 --> 00:20:15,922
Just that we always have the option
of going back to being friends.

351
00:20:16,989 --> 00:20:20,250
- Is that what you want?
- I don't know, I mean...

352
00:20:20,597 --> 00:20:23,847
You have to admit things seemed simpler
when we were just friends.

353
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,723
I guess.

354
00:20:26,404 --> 00:20:28,019
It would take the pressure off.

355
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,602
It would, wouldn't it?

356
00:20:30,861 --> 00:20:32,661
So, we'll just be friends.

357
00:20:33,437 --> 00:20:34,437
Good.

358
00:20:36,514 --> 00:20:37,514
Come here.

359
00:20:50,739 --> 00:20:51,739
Okay-dokay.
