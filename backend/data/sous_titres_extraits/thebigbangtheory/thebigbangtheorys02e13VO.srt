1
00:00:05,921 --> 00:00:07,244
Gentlemen, I put it to you:

2
00:00:07,414 --> 00:00:09,947
the worst tapioca pudding
is better than the best pudding

3
00:00:10,117 --> 00:00:11,766
of any other flavor.

4
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,367
First off,
that is axiomatically wrong

5
00:00:15,537 --> 00:00:17,987
because the best pudding
is chocolate.

6
00:00:18,411 --> 00:00:20,666
Secondly,
the organic structure of tapioca

7
00:00:20,836 --> 00:00:22,798
makes it a jiggling bowl
of potential death.

8
00:00:22,968 --> 00:00:26,892
- It is extracted from the plant...
- I'm thinking of growing a mustache.

9
00:00:28,712 --> 00:00:31,400
No kidding? Fu Manchu,
a handlebar, pencil?

10
00:00:31,662 --> 00:00:33,722
- It's extracted from...
- I'm not sure yet.

11
00:00:33,892 --> 00:00:36,113
- George Clooney has one now.
- Really?

12
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:39,074
I once saw him shopping at Ralph's.
He was buying tequila.

13
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,787
You'd thinka guy like that
would have some kind of booze lackey.

14
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:51,717
This is cruel. We'd better let him
finish before his head explodes.

15
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,920
All right, why is tap...?

16
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,508
Tapioca is extracted from the root
of the plant manihot esculenta!

17
00:00:56,678 --> 00:00:59,324
Due to a high concentration of cyanide,
it is poisonous in its raw form

18
00:00:59,494 --> 00:01:01,515
and lethal if prepared improperly!

19
00:01:04,821 --> 00:01:05,916
Feel better now?

20
00:01:06,086 --> 00:01:08,137
It is also indigenous to Brazil
as is the cocoa bean,

21
00:01:08,307 --> 00:01:10,173
from which we get chocolate,
the best pudding.

22
00:01:10,343 --> 00:01:12,504
You promised
you wouldn't do that anymore!

23
00:01:14,445 --> 00:01:15,569
Hey, Hofstadter.

24
00:01:15,831 --> 00:01:16,737
Hey, Kripke.

25
00:01:16,999 --> 00:01:19,331
Heard about your latest
anti-proton decay experiment.

26
00:01:19,456 --> 00:01:20,744
20,000 data runs

27
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:23,499
and no statistically
significant results. Very impressive.

28
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:27,873
What a jerk.

29
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,140
Don't feel bad.
Negative results are still results.

30
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:33,393
Even 20,000 of them.

31
00:01:33,518 --> 00:01:34,427
All right!

32
00:01:35,955 --> 00:01:37,638
Please don't cheer me up anymore.

33
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,052
Don't let him get to you.
It's Kripke.

34
00:01:40,314 --> 00:01:42,214
He's a ginormous knob.

35
00:01:43,089 --> 00:01:44,525
That's why he eats by himself

36
00:01:44,695 --> 00:01:47,017
instead of sitting here
at the cool table.

37
00:01:47,898 --> 00:01:49,119
For shizzle.

38
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:56,631
It's true Kripke lacks the basic
social skills that we take for granted.

39
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,537
But he also controls
the new open science grid computer

40
00:02:00,707 --> 00:02:02,690
that I need to use
to run some simulations

41
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,819
of structure formation
in the early universe.

42
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:06,381
Good luck getting time on it.

43
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:08,754
The only people he lets use it
are his friends.

44
00:02:08,924 --> 00:02:12,081
Then the solution is simple.
I shall befriend him.

45
00:02:17,029 --> 00:02:19,925
What would you say to the idea
of you and I becoming friends?

46
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:23,859
I would say I have no interest
in becoming your friend.

47
00:02:25,619 --> 00:02:26,535
Really?

48
00:02:26,764 --> 00:02:28,989
That seems rather shortsighted
coming from someone

49
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:31,520
who is generally considered
altogether unlikable.

50
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,196
Why don't you take some time
to reconsider?

51
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:37,156
Yeah, I'll do that.

52
00:02:39,724 --> 00:02:41,968
I think we're off
to a terrific start.

53
00:03:03,188 --> 00:03:05,024
Subtitles: sub-way.fr

54
00:03:07,264 --> 00:03:08,141
There you go.

55
00:03:08,311 --> 00:03:11,426
Now any e-mail from Wolowitz
will go right into your spam folder.

56
00:03:12,843 --> 00:03:14,559
Thanks.
The e-mail doesn't bother me

57
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:17,707
as much as the vacation pictures of him
in a bathing suit.

58
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:20,220
Yeah, I got the same one,

59
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:23,202
and that's not a bathing suit.
It's a tan line.

60
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:31,079
Hello,
this is Sheldon Cooper.

61
00:03:31,483 --> 00:03:34,335
I am leaving a message
for Barry Kripke.

62
00:03:36,078 --> 00:03:38,983
It was pleasant
seeing you today in the cafeteria.

63
00:03:39,624 --> 00:03:42,416
I saw that you purchased
the chef's salad.

64
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:44,232
Apparently, you did not know

65
00:03:44,402 --> 00:03:47,767
that the chef's salad is kitchen
trickery to utilize scrap meat.

66
00:03:50,444 --> 00:03:52,554
Nevertheless,
I hope you enjoyed it.

67
00:03:52,847 --> 00:03:55,218
I'm following up
on our pending friendship

68
00:03:55,388 --> 00:03:58,938
and I look forward to hearing
from you regarding its status.

69
00:04:00,004 --> 00:04:01,254
Sheldon Cooper.

70
00:04:04,335 --> 00:04:06,097
What's up with Ichabod?

71
00:04:07,383 --> 00:04:09,041
He's trying to make
a new friend.

72
00:04:09,211 --> 00:04:10,786
Really?
Well, good for him.

73
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:13,178
Unless he makes one out of wood
like Geppetto,

74
00:04:13,303 --> 00:04:15,339
I don't think it's gonna happen.

75
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:18,549
How did you guys become friends?

76
00:04:18,871 --> 00:04:21,951
There was a flyer on the bulletin board
at the university:

77
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:24,871
"Roommate wanted.
Whistlers need not apply."

78
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:29,383
- And you moved in anyway?
- I assumed he was joking.

79
00:04:29,553 --> 00:04:33,226
You'd be surprised how many particle
physicists have a whimsical side.

80
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:36,942
What about Howard and Raj?
How did he become friends with them?

81
00:04:37,112 --> 00:04:39,898
I don't know.
How do carbon atoms form a benzene ring?

82
00:04:40,175 --> 00:04:42,317
Proximity and valence electrons.

83
00:04:43,982 --> 00:04:46,332
Well, sure,
when you put it that way.

84
00:04:47,295 --> 00:04:49,244
But it all worked out, right?

85
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,325
I suppose.

86
00:04:50,852 --> 00:04:52,536
I do miss whistling, though.

87
00:04:53,172 --> 00:04:54,681
Oh, come on. Really?

88
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:56,751
First warning.

89
00:05:05,469 --> 00:05:06,719
This is for you.

90
00:05:07,972 --> 00:05:09,015
Hello, Sheldon.

91
00:05:09,652 --> 00:05:10,652
Hi.

92
00:05:13,954 --> 00:05:16,446
- What is this?
- It's a questionnaire I devised.

93
00:05:16,571 --> 00:05:19,439
I'm having some difficulty
bonding with a colleague at work

94
00:05:19,564 --> 00:05:21,678
so I'm doing a little research
to better understand

95
00:05:21,803 --> 00:05:23,681
why my current friends like me.

96
00:05:25,213 --> 00:05:27,463
Yes, well, that is a good question.

97
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:31,078
But is this really the best way
to figure it out?

98
00:05:31,203 --> 00:05:32,038
I agree.

99
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,323
The social sciences
are largely hokum.

100
00:05:34,448 --> 00:05:36,826
But short of putting
electrodes in your brain

101
00:05:36,951 --> 00:05:39,129
and monitoring your response
to my companionship,

102
00:05:39,254 --> 00:05:40,885
this is the best I can do.

103
00:05:41,765 --> 00:05:43,013
Okay, "Question one:

104
00:05:43,138 --> 00:05:45,386
"Rank the following aspects
of Sheldon Cooper

105
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,845
"in order of appeal:
Intelligence;

106
00:05:48,194 --> 00:05:49,947
"ruthless attention to hygiene;

107
00:05:50,072 --> 00:05:52,580
playfulness;
JAVA applet writing"?

108
00:05:55,311 --> 00:05:58,010
I know, I may have started out
with a fairly obvious one;

109
00:05:58,135 --> 00:06:01,118
an aspect of my most appealing trait:
playfulness.

110
00:06:02,736 --> 00:06:04,493
Go ahead and rank that number one.

111
00:06:04,618 --> 00:06:06,406
I'm afraid you're on
your own for the rest.

112
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,965
It should take you
no more than three hours.

113
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,995
Wait. How many questions
are on this thing?

114
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:12,246
Only 211.

115
00:06:13,966 --> 00:06:16,116
Don't worry.
In deference to you, I kept them all

116
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:18,084
at a high school graduate
reading level.

117
00:06:19,985 --> 00:06:20,962
Thanks, pal.

118
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:22,940
You got it... buddy.

119
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,845
Honey, did you ever consider
making friends by being,

120
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,884
I don't know, pleasant?

121
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,673
That's certainly
a thought-provoking hypothesis.

122
00:06:33,798 --> 00:06:36,548
May I suggest it
as the topic for your essay?

123
00:06:42,745 --> 00:06:45,367
Your questionnaire,
very disappointing.

124
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,533
I answered every question.

125
00:06:50,796 --> 00:06:53,537
You answered the multiple choice
questions in a pattern:

126
00:06:53,764 --> 00:06:57,428
A-B-B-A-C.
A-B-B-A-C.

127
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,186
Oh, you picked up on that?

128
00:07:03,393 --> 00:07:04,630
How could I not?

129
00:07:04,927 --> 00:07:07,269
Come on.
There's over 200 questions.

130
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:10,803
And look at some of these things.
"Sheldon is to camaraderie

131
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,376
as the space shuttle is to blank?"

132
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,208
There are a number
of acceptable answers.

133
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,348
For example,
"C: Near-Earth transport."

134
00:07:18,473 --> 00:07:21,282
But certainly not
"B: Avocado rancher."

135
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:25,569
And your essay suggesting
that I'd have better luck

136
00:07:25,694 --> 00:07:28,632
making friends if I wait
till the Cylons take over?

137
00:07:29,719 --> 00:07:30,719
Please.

138
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,586
Hold on.
I put some real work into that.

139
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:35,965
Yes, well, it's better
than what Wolowitz did.

140
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,205
He drew a raccoon

141
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,532
with what appears to be
a distended scrotum.

142
00:07:42,744 --> 00:07:44,279
It's kinda cute.

143
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:47,515
Until you get to the scrotum.

144
00:07:48,044 --> 00:07:50,718
What hope do I have
for establishing new relationships

145
00:07:50,843 --> 00:07:53,077
given that my current friends
apparently could not take

146
00:07:53,202 --> 00:07:55,390
a few hours out of their lives
to help me?

147
00:07:55,515 --> 00:07:58,491
I'm not going to defend
a big-balled raccoon.

148
00:07:59,272 --> 00:08:01,312
I don't see how you could.

149
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:04,399
What I'm trying to say is that
maybe you can't approach this

150
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:06,400
as a purely intellectual exercise.

151
00:08:07,841 --> 00:08:09,301
What do you mean?

152
00:08:11,223 --> 00:08:14,689
Remember when you tried
to learn how to swim using the Internet?

153
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:17,746
I did learn how to swim.

154
00:08:18,535 --> 00:08:19,786
On the floor.

155
00:08:20,692 --> 00:08:22,789
The skills are transferable.

156
00:08:23,455 --> 00:08:25,962
I just have no interest
in going in the water.

157
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:29,259
- Then why learn how to swim?
- The ice caps are melting.

158
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:32,241
In the future, swimming
isn't going to be optional.

159
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:35,254
But you do bring up
an interesting point.

160
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:37,270
I don't have
to break new ground here.

161
00:08:37,395 --> 00:08:39,720
I'm sure much of the research
already exists.

162
00:08:39,845 --> 00:08:41,667
No, no, my point is,

163
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:43,824
if you want to learn
how to make friends,

164
00:08:43,949 --> 00:08:46,440
then just go out to a coffee shop
or a museum.

165
00:08:46,758 --> 00:08:49,652
Meet people. Talk to them.
Take an interest in their lives.

166
00:08:50,944 --> 00:08:52,947
That's insane on the face of it.

167
00:08:54,912 --> 00:08:57,043
- Where are we going?
- You're driving me to the mall.

168
00:08:57,168 --> 00:08:59,734
I'm going to acquire a book
that summarizes the current theories

169
00:08:59,859 --> 00:09:01,998
in the field of friend-making.

170
00:09:03,177 --> 00:09:06,784
Why don't you just lie down on the floor
and swim there?

171
00:09:10,862 --> 00:09:13,474
Coping with the Death
of a Loved One.

172
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:16,679
- My condolences.
- Thank you.

173
00:09:18,151 --> 00:09:19,474
Family or friend?

174
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:21,128
- Family.
- Too bad.

175
00:09:21,743 --> 00:09:24,787
If it had been a friend,
I'm available to fill the void.

176
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:33,002
It's just as well.
She smelled like mothballs.

177
00:09:33,992 --> 00:09:37,921
If you're gonna start sniffing people,
I'm gonna go get a hot pretzel.

178
00:09:39,363 --> 00:09:40,458
Excuse me.

179
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:43,206
Do you have any books
about making friends?

180
00:09:43,776 --> 00:09:45,877
Yeah, but they're all
for little kids.

181
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,587
I assume the skills can be
extrapolated and transferred.

182
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:50,216
I guess.

183
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:52,618
They're right over there
by the wooden train set.

184
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,129
I love trains.

185
00:09:57,325 --> 00:09:58,564
I bet you do.

186
00:10:02,241 --> 00:10:03,981
My, that's awfully sticky.

187
00:10:07,165 --> 00:10:09,639
All right, let's see...

188
00:10:13,073 --> 00:10:15,499
Bernie Bunny Has Two Daddies Now.

189
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,024
That's probably
about homosexual rabbits.

190
00:10:21,075 --> 00:10:24,087
Gerry the Gerbil
and the Bullies on the Bus.

191
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:26,318
Read it. Not helpful.

192
00:10:28,881 --> 00:10:30,089
Here we go.

193
00:10:30,575 --> 00:10:33,224
<i>Stu the Cockatoo Is New at the Zoo.</i>

194
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:38,956
"Author Sarah Carpenter
lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana

195
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,073
"with her husband
and best friend, Mark,

196
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,601
and their cockatoo Stu."

197
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:49,147
Hardly makes her an expert
in making friends, wouldn't you agree?

198
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,400
I don't like birds. They scare me.

199
00:10:52,478 --> 00:10:53,478
Me, too.

200
00:10:55,453 --> 00:10:57,144
Most people don't see it.

201
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,536
- What are you reading?
- <i>Curious George</i>.

202
00:11:02,876 --> 00:11:04,329
I do like monkeys.

203
00:11:04,923 --> 00:11:06,533
Curious George is a monkey.

204
00:11:06,658 --> 00:11:09,589
Somewhat anthropomorphized, but yes.

205
00:11:10,993 --> 00:11:12,072
Say,

206
00:11:13,014 --> 00:11:15,483
maybe sometime you and I
could go see monkeys together.

207
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,634
- Would you like that?
- Okay.

208
00:11:18,332 --> 00:11:19,761
What are you doing?

209
00:11:20,575 --> 00:11:22,644
I'm making friends
with this little girl.

210
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:24,433
- What's your name?
- Rebecca.

211
00:11:24,832 --> 00:11:26,788
Hi, Rebecca.
I'm your new friend, Sheldon.

212
00:11:27,155 --> 00:11:28,645
No, you're not. Let's go.

213
00:11:29,681 --> 00:11:32,956
- We were really hitting it off.
- Don't look up. There's cameras.

214
00:11:37,245 --> 00:11:40,016
I'm curious. In the "How well do
you know Sheldon" section,

215
00:11:40,141 --> 00:11:43,035
what did you put
for his favorite amino acid?

216
00:11:44,062 --> 00:11:45,081
Lysine.

217
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:47,039
Damn it, I had lysine
and changed it.

218
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:49,856
Good, you're just in time.

219
00:11:49,981 --> 00:11:53,389
I believe I've isolated
the algorithm for making friends.

220
00:11:54,449 --> 00:11:57,132
Sheldon, there is no algorithm
for making friends.

221
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,094
Hear him out.
If he's really onto something,

222
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,050
we could open a booth at Comic-Con.
Make a fortune.

223
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,498
See, my initial approach to Kripke
had the same deficiencies

224
00:12:06,623 --> 00:12:09,807
as those that plagued Stu the Cockatoo
when he was new at the zoo.

225
00:12:11,652 --> 00:12:13,148
Stu the Cockatoo?

226
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:15,075
He's new at the zoo.

227
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:17,336
It's a terrific book.

228
00:12:17,461 --> 00:12:19,663
I've distilled its essence
into a simple flow chart

229
00:12:19,788 --> 00:12:22,008
that will guide me
through the process.

230
00:12:22,384 --> 00:12:24,541
Have you thought about
putting him in a crate

231
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,456
while you're out of the apartment?

232
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:30,001
Hello, Kripke? Sheldon Cooper here.

233
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:33,139
It occurred to me
you hadn't returned any of my calls

234
00:12:33,264 --> 00:12:35,528
because I hadn't offered
any concrete suggestions

235
00:12:35,653 --> 00:12:37,079
for pursuing our friendship.

236
00:12:37,204 --> 00:12:40,881
Perhaps the two of us might
share a meal together.

237
00:12:42,531 --> 00:12:43,510
I see.

238
00:12:43,635 --> 00:12:47,274
Well, then perhaps you'd have
time for a hot beverage?

239
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:50,799
Popular choices include
tea, coffee, cocoa.

240
00:12:51,748 --> 00:12:52,813
I see.

241
00:12:52,982 --> 00:12:54,478
No, wait. Don't hang up yet.

242
00:12:54,824 --> 00:12:56,923
What about a recreational activity?

243
00:12:57,048 --> 00:12:59,194
I bet we share
some common interests.

244
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:01,584
Tell me an interest of yours.

245
00:13:02,473 --> 00:13:03,491
Really?

246
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,958
On actual horses?

247
00:13:07,347 --> 00:13:09,445
Tell me another interest of yours.

248
00:13:10,403 --> 00:13:14,081
I'm sorry. I have no desire to get
in the water till I absolutely have to.

249
00:13:14,735 --> 00:13:16,795
Tell me another interest of yours.

250
00:13:17,165 --> 00:13:19,992
- He's stuck in an infinite loop.
- I can fix it.

251
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:25,515
Interesting, but isn't ventriloquism
by definition a solo activity?

252
00:13:26,851 --> 00:13:29,307
Tell me another interest of yours.

253
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:33,449
Is there any chance
you like monkeys?

254
00:13:34,671 --> 00:13:37,381
What is wrong with you?
Everybody likes monkeys.

255
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:40,208
Hang on, Kripke.

256
00:13:42,408 --> 00:13:43,753
A loop counter

257
00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:46,908
and an escape
to the least objectionable activity.

258
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:48,657
Howard, that's brilliant.

259
00:13:49,004 --> 00:13:50,796
I'm surprised you saw that.

260
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,515
Gee, why can't Sheldon make friends?

261
00:13:56,537 --> 00:14:00,079
All right, Kripke, that last interest
strikes me as the least objectionable,

262
00:14:00,204 --> 00:14:03,552
and I would like to propose
that we do that together.

263
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:04,959
Tomorrow.

264
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,321
Yes, I'll pay.

265
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:09,764
All right, good-bye.

266
00:14:10,255 --> 00:14:11,396
All right.

267
00:14:12,455 --> 00:14:14,207
Time to learn rock climbing.

268
00:14:22,897 --> 00:14:25,485
You know, I am a fan
of ventriloquism.

269
00:14:26,585 --> 00:14:29,641
Maybe you, me and your dummy
could go get a hot beverage.

270
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,137
He could talk while you drink.

271
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,457
Nope. I wanna climb some rocks.

272
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:42,214
This appears significantly

273
00:14:42,974 --> 00:14:45,480
more monolithic
than it did on my laptop.

274
00:14:46,781 --> 00:14:50,305
One expects to see hominids
learning to use bones as weapons.

275
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,738
- You afraid of heights, Cooper?
- Hardly.

276
00:14:53,863 --> 00:14:55,755
A fear of heights is illogical.

277
00:14:56,326 --> 00:14:59,564
A fear of falling, on the other hand,
is prudent and evolutionary.

278
00:15:00,076 --> 00:15:03,235
What would you say is
the minimum altitude I need to achieve

279
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,028
to cement our newfound friendship?

280
00:15:05,785 --> 00:15:08,448
They have birthday parties here.
Little kids climb this.

281
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,773
Little kid hominids perhaps.

282
00:15:17,015 --> 00:15:18,625
So is this your entire job?

283
00:15:19,725 --> 00:15:21,599
Your parents must be so proud.

284
00:15:23,118 --> 00:15:25,502
- Let's go, Cooper.
- I'm coming, Kripke.

285
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:29,356
The harness seems to be secure.

286
00:15:30,578 --> 00:15:32,350
A small amount of incontinence
just now,

287
00:15:32,475 --> 00:15:34,653
but the Web site said
that's to be expected.

288
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,076
This isn't so bad.

289
00:15:41,353 --> 00:15:43,166
It's like vertical swimming.

290
00:15:45,061 --> 00:15:45,965
Look at you.

291
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:48,363
- You're almost halfway to the top.
- I am?

292
00:15:51,048 --> 00:15:52,148
I was wrong.

293
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,409
It is a fear of heights.

294
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,346
- You all right there, Cooper?
- Not really.

295
00:15:57,471 --> 00:15:59,384
I feel somewhat like
an inverse tangent function

296
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:01,376
that's approached an asymptote.

297
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:04,123
- Are you saying you're stuck?
- What part of inverse tangent function

298
00:16:04,248 --> 00:16:06,172
approaching an asymptote
did you not understand?

299
00:16:06,621 --> 00:16:08,801
I understood all of it.
I'm not a moron.

300
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:10,615
Just keep going.

301
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,055
- Yeah, I don't think I can.
- Well, then climb back down.

302
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:17,536
No, that doesn't seem
any more likely.

303
00:16:18,703 --> 00:16:19,769
What's your plan?

304
00:16:20,423 --> 00:16:22,022
Well, it's not exactly a plan,

305
00:16:22,388 --> 00:16:24,202
but I think I'm going to pass out.

306
00:16:34,853 --> 00:16:36,911
Sorry, can we please
just do it one more time?

307
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:40,749
One, two, one, two, three, and...

308
00:16:55,191 --> 00:16:57,921
It's a little thing,
but you really do miss it.

309
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:00,089
Hello, everyone.

310
00:17:00,214 --> 00:17:03,563
I brought my new friend
Barry Kripke home for dinner.

311
00:17:06,354 --> 00:17:07,609
Hello to you, too.

312
00:17:08,391 --> 00:17:10,838
- How was rock climbing?
- He passed out.

313
00:17:11,327 --> 00:17:13,531
Just hung there like a big salami.

314
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:16,910
That's where I sit.

315
00:17:17,588 --> 00:17:20,163
You have a special spot?
What kind of wacko are you?

316
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:23,039
How much time you got?

317
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,169
You want some Chinese food?

318
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,505
Terrific. Got any dental floss?

319
00:17:29,096 --> 00:17:30,298
In the bathroom.

320
00:17:30,645 --> 00:17:31,724
Be right back.

321
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:34,236
I got to floss the Indian food
out of my teeth

322
00:17:34,361 --> 00:17:35,930
if I'm gonna eat Chinese.

323
00:17:37,831 --> 00:17:39,182
Sheldon, are you okay?

324
00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:41,661
Yes, I pass out all the time,

325
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,962
but it was worth it.

326
00:17:44,087 --> 00:17:46,488
I've made substantial progress
in bonding with Kripke,

327
00:17:46,613 --> 00:17:49,150
which brings me
to an awkward moment.

328
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,331
What's that?

329
00:17:50,456 --> 00:17:52,195
Maintaing five friendships

330
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,772
promises to be
a Herculean task, so...

331
00:17:55,955 --> 00:17:58,201
I'm going to have
to let one of you go.

332
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,433
Me, me, let it be me.

333
00:18:04,961 --> 00:18:07,121
Leonard, you are my roommate,

334
00:18:07,246 --> 00:18:08,670
my source of transportation,

335
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:12,214
and you help me fold my sheets
when they come out of the dryer.

336
00:18:13,018 --> 00:18:14,362
You are safe.

337
00:18:16,155 --> 00:18:18,030
- Can I whistle?
- Don't be silly.

338
00:18:20,469 --> 00:18:22,100
You do not have a PhD;

339
00:18:22,744 --> 00:18:25,520
your cologne is
an assault on the senses;

340
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:29,357
and you're not available for video games
during the Jewish high holidays.

341
00:18:30,741 --> 00:18:32,228
Guilty as charged. I'm out.

342
00:18:33,596 --> 00:18:35,165
You too are safe.

343
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,323
Come on. What do I have to do?

344
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,681
Okay, you know what?
I see where this is going.

345
00:18:41,806 --> 00:18:44,706
I'm not one of you guys.
I'm not a scientist, so just tell me...

346
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,876
Everything you're saying is true,
but please allow me to continue.

347
00:18:49,788 --> 00:18:50,867
You're out.

348
00:18:55,812 --> 00:18:57,238
That's a good question.

349
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,138
While you do provide
a certain cultural diversity

350
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:01,806
to an otherwise homogenous group,

351
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,726
your responses to the questionnaire
were truly disturbing.

352
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:08,770
How could you for a moment think
my favorite amino acid is glutamine?

353
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:13,067
He had lysine, but changed it.

354
00:19:13,533 --> 00:19:15,367
Shoulda, woulda, coulda, Raj.

355
00:19:18,605 --> 00:19:20,215
I like to floss before I eat

356
00:19:20,582 --> 00:19:22,823
so my gum pockets are open
for new food.

357
00:19:30,942 --> 00:19:32,734
How did I walk past you?

358
00:19:33,324 --> 00:19:34,255
I'm Barry.

359
00:19:35,852 --> 00:19:37,258
That's not a very hot name.

360
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,637
I'm going to call you Roxanne.

361
00:19:42,418 --> 00:19:43,473
Pot stickers.

362
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,560
Suddenly, I'm looking
pretty good, huh?

363
00:19:51,198 --> 00:19:54,070
So, Kripke, I was wondering
if there's any chance

364
00:19:54,195 --> 00:19:57,676
you could get me some time
on the open science grid computer?

365
00:20:00,725 --> 00:20:01,825
But we're friends.

366
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,658
I'm sorry.

367
00:20:03,783 --> 00:20:05,674
No, my friend.

368
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,747
I'm confused.
I was given to understand

369
00:20:09,872 --> 00:20:12,627
that you allow your friends
time on the machine.

370
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:13,921
No, that's wrong.

371
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,422
There's an official schedule.
I have no control over it.

372
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:24,111
This entire endeavor seems
to have been an exercise in futility.

373
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,519
Raj, you're back in.

374
00:20:30,656 --> 00:20:32,021
He likes monkeys.

375
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,580
You've got to give him credit
for sticking with it.

376
00:20:40,415 --> 00:20:42,330
I didn't think he had it in him.

377
00:20:43,084 --> 00:20:45,368
And he almost made it
to the top this time.
