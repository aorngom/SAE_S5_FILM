1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,348
Previously on Greek.

2
00:00:01,473 --> 00:00:04,378
I'm so happy that you decided
to go into marketing

3
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:06,424
I'm thinking about
going back to law school

4
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:08,484
- That's great.
- I brought it up with Cap.

5
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:11,375
You have to live your own life.
You have to go after what you want

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,096
- and not worry about him.
- I'm not ready to graduate.

7
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,488
- What about you and Casey ?
- If she gets into CRU Law,

8
00:00:16,613 --> 00:00:18,351
- it won't be an issue.
- If she doesn't ?

9
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,853
- I don't know.
- I'm sorry I tried to change you.

10
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,606
- What about graduation ?
- We'll worry about that in May.

11
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,024
Dana inspires me.

12
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,341
Do you need to talk to me
about anything else ?

13
00:00:27,466 --> 00:00:30,446
I've been thinking. I enjoy our time
together, but I don't want to hide it.

14
00:00:31,287 --> 00:00:32,239
No.

15
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:33,532
Sorry.

16
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,501
Why won't you tell me your plan ?

17
00:00:35,626 --> 00:00:37,536
- There isn't one.
- I could help you.

18
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,206
But I also know if I have a problem,
I can come to you.

19
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:41,749
I wish you felt the same.

20
00:00:42,227 --> 00:00:44,388
Ladies and gentlemen, as president,

21
00:00:44,513 --> 00:00:45,628
it is my job

22
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:48,062
to nominate the one man
who can lead us to victory.

23
00:00:48,187 --> 00:00:50,424
And our new Revenge Chair :
Rusty Cartwright !

24
00:00:53,077 --> 00:00:54,970
Phase one is complete.

25
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,277
Phase Two :

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,765
Myrtle Beach.

27
00:01:00,623 --> 00:01:04,063
After years of pranks and brawls
and pledge paddles, this is it.

28
00:01:04,491 --> 00:01:07,858
Revenge on Omega Chi
has never looked so sweet.

29
00:01:10,902 --> 00:01:11,827
And fun !

30
00:01:11,952 --> 00:01:14,776
The first phase of Mission :
Probable is complete.

31
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,285
The next three are ready
and waiting in Myrtle Beach.

32
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,459
You might have to do
some of this without me.

33
00:01:20,584 --> 00:01:23,249
I have a secret mission
of my own involving your sister.

34
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,482
And put Evan Chambers down.
What are you doing ?

35
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,528
Are you talking about
Casey's birthday ?

36
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:33,755
I thought you were cc'ed
on her gift wish list.

37
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,554
No, I'm pretty sure this is something
she won't be expecting.

38
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:40,466
No way !

39
00:01:43,455 --> 00:01:45,705
Wait, is that the same lavaliere
that Beaver...

40
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,940
Don't ask questions.
You don't want to know.

41
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,067
This is Casey's last spring break.

42
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,849
I'm gonna get this right.
Find the perfect moment.

43
00:01:56,793 --> 00:01:58,083
You know, if this works,

44
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,828
we're never gonna have to worry
about the Omega Chis again.

45
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:02,665
That's the plan.

46
00:02:03,883 --> 00:02:04,749
Mini-car !

47
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,420
You're going down,
little Omega Chi pony !

48
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,119
B Team, rappel !

49
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,702
Boot stomps !

50
00:02:21,447 --> 00:02:23,545
That makes my sixth interview
this week !

51
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,146
After graduation, I'm just
gonna have to live off the land.

52
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,606
Whatever that means.

53
00:02:28,892 --> 00:02:31,845
- It went well ?
- If you ask me what my weaknesses are,

54
00:02:32,256 --> 00:02:33,986
I'm gonna tell you !
Punctuality's

55
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,488
overrated anyway.

56
00:02:35,853 --> 00:02:39,158
Fortunately, we have Spring Break
to delight and maybe even surprise us.

57
00:02:39,628 --> 00:02:42,031
And take our minds off
of all this post-grad craziness.

58
00:02:42,156 --> 00:02:45,113
By post-grad craziness, are you
referring to the fact that you're both

59
00:02:45,238 --> 00:02:48,209
insanely checking your e-mail
for law school responses ?

60
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,153
So far I've been rejected

61
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:52,838
from Stanford, Georgetown and Texas.

62
00:02:53,153 --> 00:02:54,924
I feel like Laura at a mixer.

63
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,618
- You still have George Washington...
- And CRU.

64
00:02:57,743 --> 00:02:59,804
I just want to know already.

65
00:03:01,175 --> 00:03:03,432
You know,
we did get some mail earlier today.

66
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,892
What ? Where is it ?

67
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,238
Where is it at ?

68
00:03:06,871 --> 00:03:08,437
They say you can tell a lot about

69
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,242
whether you were accepted
or not by the size of the envelope.

70
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:12,358
I can't look !

71
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,774
- Like what they say about guys' feet.
- That's a myth !

72
00:03:14,899 --> 00:03:16,499
Where's the damn mail ?

73
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,632
It's big.
It's big.

74
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,566
It's really big.

75
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:22,952
Read it.

76
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,953
Open it !

77
00:03:27,086 --> 00:03:30,672
My God, I got into GW Law School
in Washington, DC !

78
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:35,548
- That's awesome !
- I know !

79
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:36,731
My God.

80
00:03:37,106 --> 00:03:39,156
This is really happening.

81
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,886
Yeah, it's happening.

82
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,141
And you know they really
did admit you because

83
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:45,516
George Washington University
cannot tell a lie.

84
00:03:49,504 --> 00:03:51,397
Ash, did you get any mail from CRU ?

85
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,582
Not yet, right ?

86
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:55,693
Right.

87
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,424
- = 320 =-
"All Children... Grow Up"

88
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:05,017
Kappa Team

89
00:04:08,788 --> 00:04:09,915
And since the KTs

90
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,543
were gracious enough
to suck at golf last week,

91
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:16,101
I'm proud to say we have a sic
party house in Myrtle Beach !

92
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,677
It's on the Strand, wet bar, hot tub.
It's gonna be awesome !

93
00:04:22,348 --> 00:04:23,596
All right, but not

94
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,948
too awesome, guys.
I got a letter from Nationals,

95
00:04:26,073 --> 00:04:28,010
they're seriously
cracking down this year.

96
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:31,295
"Given several incidents involving
illegal or untoward behavior

97
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,322
"by some chapters last spring break,

98
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:36,775
"members involved in any illegal
activity will risk immediate suspension

99
00:04:37,115 --> 00:04:39,194
and the revocation
of their charter".

100
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,573
Well, there goes our South
Carolinian prostitution ring.

101
00:04:43,643 --> 00:04:44,867
All right, next up,

102
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:47,796
house elections are after
we return from spring break,

103
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:50,122
so I'll now open the floor
to presidential nominations.

104
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:51,957
JP ?

105
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:54,435
I nominate Trip Sutcliffe.

106
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,839
Well, I graciously and humbly

107
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,365
accept this nomination.

108
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,594
I would like to nominate
Calvin Owens.

109
00:05:05,369 --> 00:05:06,138
Me ?

110
00:05:06,623 --> 00:05:07,514
Shocker.

111
00:05:08,181 --> 00:05:10,559
Even though we broke up,
I still appreciate his integrity

112
00:05:10,947 --> 00:05:13,312
and I would love to see him
lead this house.

113
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:15,475
Thanks, Grant.

114
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,816
Great. Any other nominations ?

115
00:05:19,325 --> 00:05:23,325
All right, then campaign season will
commence after Spring Break

116
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,658
for Sutcliffe versus Owens.

117
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:27,428
Meeting adjourned.

118
00:05:28,987 --> 00:05:30,955
- So that was pretty cool of Grant ?
- Yeah,

119
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:33,405
I'm glad to see you guys
are staying friends.

120
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,711
- I'm not sure he did you a favor.
- What do you mean ?

121
00:05:38,192 --> 00:05:40,714
You know what I've been through
with this house, these guys.

122
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,509
How much of a jerk I've had to be.
I'm just no sure

123
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,184
this is a job you're wired
to handle.

124
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,805
Or even really want.

125
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,128
I've never been
to Myrtle Beach before.

126
00:05:52,253 --> 00:05:54,389
It's so great.
There's this club, Paradox.

127
00:05:54,514 --> 00:05:57,398
Are they gonna stamp our hands or give
us one of those wristband things ?

128
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,984
I couldn't get in.
But the beach is so great.

129
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,869
Provided you wear sun block,

130
00:06:02,115 --> 00:06:03,320
which I didn't.

131
00:06:03,685 --> 00:06:04,752
Sounds...

132
00:06:05,336 --> 00:06:06,555
dangerous.

133
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,989
Well, the truth is,
I was actually only there for one night.

134
00:06:10,114 --> 00:06:12,705
I ended up coming back
with Calvin and Dale.

135
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,124
See, Calvin and I were kind
of in a fight because

136
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,113
of the feud between our houses.

137
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,257
Your houses sure fight a lot.

138
00:06:19,382 --> 00:06:21,588
Well, this Spring Break's going
to be different.

139
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:25,843
There are a few things I have to do for
KT while I'm there, but outside of that,

140
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,137
it's gonna be all Dana-Rusty,
all the time.

141
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,390
I can't wait. I was lucky to get a room
so last minute.

142
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,558
Well...

143
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,228
I know we've only been
going out a couple of weeks.

144
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,582
And the way the economy is...

145
00:06:40,006 --> 00:06:41,342
We could share a room.

146
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,444
To save money.

147
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,240
Only if you want !

148
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:48,657
Because of the economy.
And stuff.

149
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:54,343
I wouldn't mind...
saving a little money.

150
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:58,620
That's great !
Because the economy sucks,

151
00:06:58,745 --> 00:06:59,745
so...

152
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,869
we can be frugal.

153
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,173
Together.

154
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,733
Yes, sir. I completely see the irony
of asking you to do something illegal

155
00:07:12,858 --> 00:07:15,264
regarding admissions to a school
that teaches the law, but

156
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:19,361
if I did get into CRU Law, could you
just like cough or sniff or something ?

157
00:07:19,486 --> 00:07:21,892
One cough yes, two coughs no ?
Hello ?

158
00:07:23,617 --> 00:07:24,583
Stupid laws.

159
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,821
I have some good news. I just got off
the phone with Nationals and next year

160
00:07:27,946 --> 00:07:30,574
they're requiring all houses employ
a full-time house mother.

161
00:07:31,406 --> 00:07:33,295
- How's that good news ?
- I meant for us,

162
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,870
because we're graduating.

163
00:07:35,232 --> 00:07:36,638
I wish I was graduating.

164
00:07:36,763 --> 00:07:38,863
Trust me, little sis, you don't.

165
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,238
Where are we on Casey's
surprise birthday party ?

166
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,998
We're set ! I reserved a section
at Tijuana Tony's.

167
00:07:47,123 --> 00:07:48,991
Big banner, lots of balloons,
pink ones.

168
00:07:49,116 --> 00:07:52,376
And make sure they have a lemon drop
waiting for her. Then keep them coming.

169
00:07:53,786 --> 00:07:54,608
What ?

170
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:57,208
Casey's as predictable
as a Katherine Heigl movie.

171
00:07:57,999 --> 00:08:00,020
So what's all this graduation talk ?

172
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:02,981
Just the thought of going
to spring break single ?

173
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,442
- It's kinda sad.
- And kinda my second year doing it.

174
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,238
- Sorry.
- No, don't be.

175
00:08:09,627 --> 00:08:11,657
We can find fun new guys together !

176
00:08:12,014 --> 00:08:13,617
I'm kinda missing my lame old one.

177
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,996
We need to shake this Evan Chambers
thing. You know what we could do ?

178
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,332
We could take a vacation
from ourselves.

179
00:08:20,888 --> 00:08:23,005
Can we go somewhere better
than Myrtle Beach ?

180
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,878
No, but we can lie about who we are.

181
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:28,326
I used to do it all the time on family
vacations. On one trip to San Francisco,

182
00:08:28,451 --> 00:08:30,849
I told this waiter I was
a teen prodigy in town

183
00:08:30,974 --> 00:08:32,942
to play the cello
for Tony Blair and Oprah.

184
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,681
And I got free dessert.
It was awesome.

185
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:38,600
Trust me.

186
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:44,260
Hey, you heading back down
to Sin in the Sand Land ?

187
00:08:44,385 --> 00:08:46,596
Yeah. I thought you were going
turkey-hunting again.

188
00:08:46,721 --> 00:08:50,154
I thought I'd do something different.
Hang out by the pool, get some sun.

189
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:53,532
It's too bad you don't want to go
to Sin in the Sand Land.

190
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,535
I wouldn't say no.

191
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,265
You just called it
"Sin in the Sand Land."

192
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,405
- Why would you want to go ?
- For the sand. If I were invited.

193
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,111
My room is going to be occupied.

194
00:09:09,005 --> 00:09:11,717
But I do know someone else
who has an extra room.

195
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,573
- I can call her and see if...
- Is that an invitation ?

196
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:17,727
Do you want to go to Myrtle Beach
with me and Dana ?

197
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,335
- Dana's going ?
- I'm sure she won't mind.

198
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,311
No, I just find her really grating.

199
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,438
Let me think about it.

200
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:28,275
All right, I'll pack my floaties.

201
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,428
You're wasting valuable
party time, Case ! Let's go !

202
00:09:37,553 --> 00:09:38,584
Hold on, guys.

203
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:41,330
Hi... do you have any mail
for Casey Cartwright ?

204
00:09:41,935 --> 00:09:44,900
I'm her. I mean, I'm she.
She's me. I'm me. Hi.

205
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:47,162
Hi. I can't deliver mail
to strangers.

206
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,603
You're going to have to wait
until I get to your house.

207
00:09:49,728 --> 00:09:52,003
This might be my last spring break
with my boyfriend.

208
00:09:52,128 --> 00:09:55,385
Because we're going down two different
life paths. I get into CRU Law School.

209
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,098
Law school ?
So you know it's illegal...

210
00:09:59,241 --> 00:10:00,259
Irony, got it.

211
00:10:00,384 --> 00:10:03,481
Regardless, if I get into CRU, that'd
buy us a few more years. If I don't,

212
00:10:03,606 --> 00:10:06,563
I've to accept this is a college thing
and we'll have to go our separate ways.

213
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,233
- I deliver mail for a living.
- I'll pay you.

214
00:10:10,088 --> 00:10:13,111
Also illegal. You know what ?
Never mind, here.

215
00:10:13,953 --> 00:10:15,803
I'll give you a trick of the trade.

216
00:10:15,928 --> 00:10:19,451
You can tell whether you were accepted
or not by the size of the envelope.

217
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:21,036
CRU Law, right ?

218
00:10:22,231 --> 00:10:23,038
Sorry.

219
00:10:24,736 --> 00:10:25,736
Thanks.

220
00:10:42,855 --> 00:10:46,394
- Anything from CRU ?
- Just this underwear catalog.

221
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,648
- Can I have it ?
- We've talked about this, Beav.

222
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,777
This is gonna be a spring break
you'll never forget.

223
00:10:54,136 --> 00:10:55,070
I think so.

224
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,124


225
00:11:12,956 --> 00:11:14,994
It's as God-awful as I'd imagined.

226
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:18,209
You know, Dale, I really wish
I hadn't canceled that room.

227
00:11:18,334 --> 00:11:20,012
I don't mind staying with you two.

228
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:28,353
There's gotta be
a Hide-A-Bed or something.

229
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,153
Where's it hiding ?

230
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:36,512
Sorry, Dana.

231
00:11:37,046 --> 00:11:39,948
It's okay. I just thought
we were gonna...

232
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,533
save a little money.

233
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,910
We are. We're doing this three ways.

234
00:11:44,859 --> 00:11:47,099
No ! Not in the way you're thinking.

235
00:11:48,014 --> 00:11:50,042
But there can still be some savings.

236
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,017
We can save some money elsewhere.

237
00:11:53,105 --> 00:11:55,075
I brought coupons,
for your pleasure.

238
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,884
Stone Phillips says a black light
is the best way to check for residual...

239
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,093
protein matter.

240
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:05,689
There it is.

241
00:12:05,814 --> 00:12:08,602
Looks like someone saved money
all over the room.

242
00:12:09,031 --> 00:12:10,204
On the phone ?

243
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,484
I call the floor.

244
00:12:16,243 --> 00:12:17,527
Guess we get the bed.

245
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,957
Did you guys see the
hot tub out back ?

246
00:12:25,082 --> 00:12:27,371
This place is better than the house
on Jersey Shore.

247
00:12:27,698 --> 00:12:29,815
And with fewer
hair-gelled fame-whores.

248
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,957
I can't believe we lucked out
with this place.

249
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,252
I can't believe the KTs
lucked into this place.

250
00:12:37,145 --> 00:12:39,925
What the hell are you doing here ?
This is my boss's house.

251
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,554
- There's been a misunderstanding.
- No, freaking kidding !

252
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,821
This is our house.
We rented it for the week.

253
00:12:46,946 --> 00:12:48,558
No, these guys we know rented it.

254
00:12:49,342 --> 00:12:51,019
What are you, stupid or something ?

255
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:53,939
You got exactly ten seconds
to get off this property.

256
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:55,649
Or what ?

257
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,585
Sir, we apologize to you.

258
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:06,535
And we don't want any trouble
so we will be leaving now.

259
00:13:06,957 --> 00:13:09,121
Take these items, please,
as a gift, and...

260
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,081
Sorry.

261
00:13:14,892 --> 00:13:17,415
It's a set-up. Kappa Taus wanted
us to win that tournament.

262
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,141
- Well, now we're homeless.
- Guess we kinda had it coming.

263
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,432
Had it coming ? Let's serve it back.

264
00:13:22,557 --> 00:13:24,560
Let's find a place
to stay first, Trip.

265
00:13:30,715 --> 00:13:32,214
Phase two is complete.

266
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,736
So that's it. I guess I'm leaving
Cyprus and...

267
00:13:42,214 --> 00:13:43,424
leaving Cappie.

268
00:13:45,048 --> 00:13:46,048
I'm sorry.

269
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,226
But I thought you'd
accepted your relationship

270
00:13:49,351 --> 00:13:51,413
with Cappie would end
after graduation.

271
00:13:51,653 --> 00:13:54,958
I did, but that's when everything
was... theoretical.

272
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,419
- And now it's retical.
- Exactly.

273
00:13:57,826 --> 00:13:59,045
I'm gonna be 22 !

274
00:13:59,227 --> 00:14:01,505
Do you know who's 22 ? Old people.

275
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,593
But do old people bungee jump ?

276
00:14:06,004 --> 00:14:07,678
Come on, it's our last spring break

277
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:10,065
I'm not going to let you
angst your way through it.

278
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:12,976
I am gonna miss you.

279
00:14:13,701 --> 00:14:15,451
I'm gonna miss you, too !

280
00:14:22,468 --> 00:14:25,162
How could I not have
gotten into CRU ?

281
00:14:25,287 --> 00:14:28,867
I mean, that was my safety school !
GW Law was sort of a long shot.

282
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:32,969
You got into law school ?
Congrats ! I went to Georgetown.

283
00:14:33,513 --> 00:14:35,320
Really ? Any advice ?

284
00:14:35,445 --> 00:14:36,333
Yeah.

285
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,084
It's really hard.

286
00:14:40,105 --> 00:14:41,213
Don't flunk out.

287
00:14:46,332 --> 00:14:49,317
Who wants shots
from the Margarito Bandito ?

288
00:14:53,746 --> 00:14:55,096
You want a shot ?

289
00:14:55,474 --> 00:14:56,924
God, yes ! Please !

290
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:01,728
Here !

291
00:15:06,054 --> 00:15:08,639
My first fake ID.
I can't believe it worked.

292
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:12,536
- Thank you, "Chad Stewart."
- Don't thank me, "Penelope Holmes."

293
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:13,810
Thank Kappa Tau.

294
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,081
What's the matter,
"Francis Domingo" ?

295
00:15:16,584 --> 00:15:18,672
There's an awful lot
of gratuitous flesh.

296
00:15:18,797 --> 00:15:21,267
It's like the CBS Evening News
with Katie Couric.

297
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,757
Well, I might try the bar.
What should get ?

298
00:15:27,246 --> 00:15:30,097
"Sex on the Beach".
"Sex in the Water".

299
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:33,514
"Sex Wading in the Water but
Planning to Come Back to the Beach."

300
00:15:33,712 --> 00:15:35,270
What do you think, Rusty ?

301
00:15:36,577 --> 00:15:39,019
Just get anything you want.

302
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,882
With drink names like that,
they're practically promoting

303
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:45,016
unwanted pregnancies.
You won't have to worry about that.

304
00:15:45,141 --> 00:15:47,444
- Now that I'm sharing the room.
- Thanks, Francis.

305
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,613
Thank you.

306
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,874
I'm Taylor.
I'm a dancer from Portland

307
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:58,049
who loves pugs, moody floral prints
and the music of Muse.

308
00:15:58,174 --> 00:15:59,165
And you are ?

309
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:00,709
Julia.

310
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,635
Well that's a start.

311
00:16:04,689 --> 00:16:07,299
Who are Julia and Taylor
going to meet first ?

312
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,163
I think you got one.

313
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:19,019
I'm gonna go in for a closer look.

314
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,568
I'm Taylor.
I'm a dancer from Portland.

315
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,194
I love your top.

316
00:16:28,553 --> 00:16:30,949
It seems leopard print's
really making a comeback.

317
00:16:31,842 --> 00:16:32,824
OK... thanks.

318
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,394
I have this friend

319
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,829
who just broke up with his boyfriend.
I could call him.

320
00:16:39,668 --> 00:16:40,415
Hi ?

321
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,894
Sorry, cutie.
This is just business.

322
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,136
We come down here every year
to observe trends,

323
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:47,297
check out the young people.
I like your look.

324
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:49,598
I'm Faith Flowers.

325
00:16:49,723 --> 00:16:52,177
Well, Faith Flowers,
let me be clear.

326
00:16:52,591 --> 00:16:54,658
I'm not interested in porn,

327
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,184
or lifting my top
or making out with a girl.

328
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:59,100
Shame on you.

329
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,732
Was that Faith Flowers ?

330
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,764
I didn't know you watched porn.

331
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,245
Faith Flowers is a trend forecaster.

332
00:17:10,684 --> 00:17:12,946
My father hired her
as a consultant back in the day.

333
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,539
Companies pay her to tell them
what the latest trends are.

334
00:17:15,664 --> 00:17:16,868
That's a real job ?

335
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:20,914
I'd be so good at that !
It's like being cool and psychic !

336
00:17:21,142 --> 00:17:22,579
Do something about it.

337
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,543
- What ? Beg her for a job ?
- She's right there...

338
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:28,669
Oh, no !

339
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,641
She was right there.

340
00:17:31,191 --> 00:17:32,509
It's like she's magic.

341
00:17:35,504 --> 00:17:37,138
She's the Fairy Job Mother.

342
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,243
Look, we already
have a hotel, all right ?

343
00:17:42,368 --> 00:17:44,665
So let's put everything behind us
and have some fun.

344
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,864
Hi, guys. How's the house ?

345
00:17:47,172 --> 00:17:48,864
We sure are pissed we lost it.

346
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:52,820
That house belongs to someone else.
Someone armed.

347
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,365
And it's spring break,
so we're stuck in a crap hotel.

348
00:17:57,015 --> 00:17:58,576
Sorry to hear about that, Cal.

349
00:17:59,029 --> 00:17:59,775
Thanks.

350
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,158
Heath meant that sarcastically,
by the way.

351
00:18:03,718 --> 00:18:06,830
When you guys are trying
to sleep in your crappy hotel,

352
00:18:06,955 --> 00:18:09,736
I hope you dream of Jeremy,
Ferret and Wade.

353
00:18:10,454 --> 00:18:12,037
You're still whining about that ?

354
00:18:12,162 --> 00:18:14,299
We didn't mean for them
to get expelled.

355
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:17,589
Then I didn't mean to sleep
with your girlfriend, Bing.

356
00:18:18,644 --> 00:18:19,944
Wait, yes I did.

357
00:18:22,276 --> 00:18:24,768
Everyone remember
what Nationals said.

358
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:25,937
All right...

359
00:18:26,624 --> 00:18:28,523
Happy spring break, Evan Pompeo !

360
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:31,776
Of <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> fame !

361
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,206
How's your first
college spring break so far ?

362
00:18:46,602 --> 00:18:47,875
I never want to leave !

363
00:18:48,689 --> 00:18:50,794
I heard about GW,
that's so exciting !

364
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:54,089
- Yeah, really exciting.
- Where are you going to live ?

365
00:18:54,832 --> 00:18:57,801
- I haven't thought about it.
- Are you going to get a roommate ?

366
00:18:58,258 --> 00:19:00,597
- I'm not sure.
- Do you even know anyone there ?

367
00:19:01,063 --> 00:19:01,805
No.

368
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:04,918
You're probably not going to have
a whole lot of time to socialize.

369
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:07,000
I bet law school is super hard.

370
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,465
Are you ready for it ?

371
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:16,759
You know what ?
I don't know.

372
00:19:16,884 --> 00:19:19,418
I'm not even 100 percent sure
that I'm going.

373
00:19:19,823 --> 00:19:20,823
I mean...

374
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,000
I could just stay in Cyprus
for another year.

375
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,580
Maybe take
that housemother job at ZBZ.

376
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:28,357
You should totally stay !

377
00:19:33,575 --> 00:19:34,380
Right ?

378
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:38,385


379
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:42,808
My parents say hi.

380
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:45,057
They can't sleep at night
knowing I'm down here.

381
00:19:45,182 --> 00:19:48,058
Their only comfort is knowing
I'm below the Mason-Dixon line.

382
00:19:48,773 --> 00:19:50,188
So what should we do today ?

383
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:51,975
You could do your own thing today.

384
00:19:52,485 --> 00:19:54,687
But I'm not sure
how much fun I can have alone

385
00:19:55,037 --> 00:19:57,320
on a plantation tour.
Why don't you come with me ?

386
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:59,784
Dana and I had kinda had
some romantic time planned.

387
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:02,465
What's more romantic than taking
in the architectural detail

388
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,285
of two-century-old
slaves' quarters ?

389
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:06,611
I read online that girls love them.

390
00:20:07,686 --> 00:20:11,036
I appreciate you coming all this way
because you wanted to spend time

391
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:12,877
- with me.
- I didn't come for you.

392
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,337
Do you think I enjoy
being your third wheel ?

393
00:20:16,727 --> 00:20:18,155
Then why are you here ?

394
00:20:19,298 --> 00:20:21,260
Forget it, have fun
with your girlfriend.

395
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:29,227
Is Francis okay ?

396
00:20:29,841 --> 00:20:31,093
I have no idea.

397
00:20:31,835 --> 00:20:33,731
You know, we're alone.

398
00:20:34,328 --> 00:20:35,976
Do you want to save some money ?

399
00:20:39,578 --> 00:20:41,643
Crap ! I've got this KT stuff
I gotta do.

400
00:20:41,768 --> 00:20:43,532
It's Phase Three,
I'll be right back.

401
00:20:44,522 --> 00:20:45,929
I will wait here.

402
00:20:49,611 --> 00:20:51,557
Or I'll go to the beach.

403
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,173
Wake up, Casey.

404
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,611
Hurry, wake up !

405
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:30,833
Happy birthday !

406
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:33,624
That's so nice.

407
00:21:37,085 --> 00:21:39,964
My gosh, I am so hung over.

408
00:21:40,438 --> 00:21:41,438
Yeah.

409
00:21:41,785 --> 00:21:43,259
How are you not ?

410
00:21:43,632 --> 00:21:44,632
Practice.

411
00:21:44,885 --> 00:21:47,430
You were the life of the party
last night.

412
00:21:47,911 --> 00:21:50,515
At one point, you put a lamp shade
on your head.

413
00:21:51,695 --> 00:21:53,937
You were so cute and cliché.

414
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:55,330
It was fun.

415
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:58,350
Thanks for the... cruller.

416
00:21:59,581 --> 00:22:02,628
- I actually had something else...
- I didn't get into CRU.

417
00:22:06,272 --> 00:22:07,116
I'm sorry.

418
00:22:10,106 --> 00:22:11,496
But, I've been thinking...

419
00:22:12,436 --> 00:22:13,456
about us.

420
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:17,302
And my life in Cyprus
and the sorority.

421
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:19,003
And I have decided...

422
00:22:19,451 --> 00:22:20,505
to stay.

423
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:23,591
I can defer GW for a year.
Maybe even two.

424
00:22:24,528 --> 00:22:26,172
You're not still drunk, are you ?

425
00:22:26,568 --> 00:22:28,596
I've even been thinking about

426
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:31,647
taking up the house
mother position at ZBZ.

427
00:22:35,252 --> 00:22:37,642
I love my life at ZBZ,

428
00:22:38,043 --> 00:22:39,339
and I love you.

429
00:22:40,196 --> 00:22:41,525
Why would I leave ?

430
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:50,535
Do you know what I feel like
doing now ?

431
00:22:51,171 --> 00:22:52,331
I hope so.

432
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,598
Stop it.

433
00:22:53,723 --> 00:22:55,790
I'm gonna get some clothes on.
Let's go.

434
00:22:59,622 --> 00:23:01,921
Well, nothing
on the Fairy Job Mother so far.

435
00:23:02,613 --> 00:23:04,663
How are you doing
on boy patrol, Julia ?

436
00:23:04,788 --> 00:23:05,887
None so far.

437
00:23:06,483 --> 00:23:08,386
You're still on vacation
from yourself !

438
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,100
Look for boys.

439
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:11,643
I can't vacate.

440
00:23:12,303 --> 00:23:13,419
I miss Evan.

441
00:23:14,637 --> 00:23:16,593
Are you going to
do something about it ?

442
00:23:16,718 --> 00:23:18,483
Right. Just pour my heart out

443
00:23:18,608 --> 00:23:20,241
and plead for him to take me back.

444
00:23:22,381 --> 00:23:23,700
He's right over there.

445
00:23:28,334 --> 00:23:31,169
Just open up myself to him
and possibly have him shut me down ?

446
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:33,661
You and I have had
our set of issues.

447
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:35,335
If I can forgive you...

448
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:37,262
maybe he can too.

449
00:23:40,803 --> 00:23:43,067
Can you give me a minute ?
I'll meet up with you.

450
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:53,155
- Hi.
- Hi.

451
00:23:59,185 --> 00:24:01,984
Here's the thing.
I'm just gonna get to the point.

452
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,216
I screwed up... big time.

453
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:09,017
I hurt you and I'm sorry for that.

454
00:24:10,567 --> 00:24:12,068
I still care about you.

455
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,335
A lot, actually.

456
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:20,082
And I miss you.

457
00:24:23,042 --> 00:24:24,711
And I'd appreciate a second chance.

458
00:24:30,421 --> 00:24:31,421
I can't.

459
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:35,273
I appreciate your apology.

460
00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:39,393
And I can forgive,
but I'm honestly not sure,

461
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:40,852
if I can forget.

462
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:42,730
Or if I even really want to.

463
00:24:43,218 --> 00:24:44,624
I'm still pissed.

464
00:24:47,063 --> 00:24:48,063
I'm sorry.

465
00:24:49,777 --> 00:24:50,777
So then...

466
00:24:52,726 --> 00:24:53,615
there it is.

467
00:25:12,324 --> 00:25:15,767
You can see a lot up here.
You can practically see forever.

468
00:25:15,892 --> 00:25:18,516
Speaking of forever, they something
I want to give to you.

469
00:25:22,553 --> 00:25:25,102
If you're gonna puke I'd throw it
more that direction.

470
00:25:25,227 --> 00:25:26,878
I think I see some OCs down there.

471
00:25:27,003 --> 00:25:28,272
You know, I'm okay.

472
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,320
Why don't you go first ?

473
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,698
I thought you wanted to do this.
Are you scared ?

474
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,032
I'm not scared.

475
00:25:35,415 --> 00:25:36,576
It's just...

476
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:39,744
- What if the cord breaks ?
- That never happens.

477
00:25:40,601 --> 00:25:42,007
- Does it ?
- Nah.

478
00:25:42,132 --> 00:25:43,416
Nah, never happens.

479
00:25:44,016 --> 00:25:45,713
Well, what if it's calibrated wrong

480
00:25:45,838 --> 00:25:49,130
and I hit the ground, bounce back up,
hit the platform and the ground again ?

481
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,047
Seems a little Wile E Coyote.

482
00:25:51,172 --> 00:25:53,259
There's some basis
in real physics there.

483
00:25:53,731 --> 00:25:55,803
I think that's just
the fear talking.

484
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:59,098
So what if it is fear ?
Fear's natural. It's good.

485
00:25:59,436 --> 00:26:01,058
It keeps you from making mistakes.

486
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,151
Doing things
that you're not ready for.

487
00:26:04,182 --> 00:26:06,615
Not when it keeps you
from living your life.

488
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,857
Having fun.

489
00:26:08,272 --> 00:26:09,817
I just don't want to do it.

490
00:26:09,942 --> 00:26:13,237
So I'm going to crawl back down.
I'll see you on the ground.

491
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,156
Not if I see you first.

492
00:26:19,414 --> 00:26:20,828
I ran into Rebecca earlier.

493
00:26:21,652 --> 00:26:22,705
She apologized.

494
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,109
- Wanted to get back together.
- And ?

495
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:27,504
I said no.

496
00:26:27,762 --> 00:26:29,295
I mean, are you kidding ?

497
00:26:29,578 --> 00:26:32,555
You know you still like her.
Why don't you give her another chance ?

498
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,176
Because then if I get burned again,
I'm the fool.

499
00:26:36,897 --> 00:26:37,845
No thank you.

500
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,430
See, Cal, you're too nice.

501
00:26:40,631 --> 00:26:42,308
Guys. What the hell ?

502
00:26:46,497 --> 00:26:48,090
Is that the guy from the house ?

503
00:26:48,215 --> 00:26:50,608
And isn't that your little
KT buddy paying him ?

504
00:26:57,933 --> 00:26:59,533
Are you buying some guns ?

505
00:27:01,964 --> 00:27:02,870
Who ?

506
00:27:03,183 --> 00:27:04,080
What ?

507
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:05,327
That guy ?

508
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:07,261
I've never seen that guy before.

509
00:27:07,386 --> 00:27:10,039
You hired that guy to kick us
out of that beach house.

510
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,980
Joke's over.

511
00:27:14,832 --> 00:27:15,758
You got me.

512
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:18,970
I must be going now.

513
00:27:21,011 --> 00:27:22,011
No problems.

514
00:27:22,968 --> 00:27:24,892
So, if that wasn't his house,

515
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,394
who's staying there now ?

516
00:27:26,777 --> 00:27:28,479
- Nobody ?
- Nobody ? All right.

517
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,774
Then we're taking back our house.

518
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:35,278


519
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:40,324
All right ! Everybody listen up !

520
00:27:40,655 --> 00:27:41,450
We

521
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:45,538
should toast the Omega Chis
for making this spring break memorable.

522
00:27:46,116 --> 00:27:47,039
Cheers !

523
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:56,882
We said you could invite
one friend from school.

524
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,655
Cap, I'm sorry,
they caught me paying off Roy.

525
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:03,306
Listen, we're taking back this house.
We won it fair and square. So get out.

526
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:05,433
We're not leaving, Chambers.
You lied to me.

527
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:08,008
You got three of our brothers expelled.
Leave us the house,

528
00:28:08,133 --> 00:28:09,562
- we'll call it even.
- No way.

529
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:12,940
If you want us gone,
then you're going to have to kill us.

530
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:14,967
"Kill" ?

531
00:28:15,686 --> 00:28:17,778
What am I walking into here, boys ?

532
00:28:19,377 --> 00:28:20,281
Officer.

533
00:28:20,687 --> 00:28:22,908
Everything's fine.
We're gonna turn the music down.

534
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,885
And... these guys
were just leaving.

535
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,537
Who's house is this ?

536
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:27,705
It's ours.

537
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:29,999
It's theirs.

538
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:32,438
You heard the man.
We were just leaving.

539
00:28:32,563 --> 00:28:33,919
Come on, KTs ! Let's go !

540
00:28:44,048 --> 00:28:46,432
Cheese and crackers !
Is this your donkey, too ?

541
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,225
No, we've never seen that before.

542
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:50,519
What else here isn't yours ?

543
00:28:53,837 --> 00:28:55,941
Who ordered the fat,
ugly strippers ?

544
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:58,819
What happened to the party ?

545
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,292
- That's not ours either.
- Have you been drinking ?

546
00:29:01,678 --> 00:29:02,907
How old are you, son ?

547
00:29:03,214 --> 00:29:05,042
I am 21, you jackass.

548
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,601
I got a card to prove it.
And that's

549
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,707
Senor Domingo to you, jefe.

550
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,292
Yeah, that's right.

551
00:29:13,937 --> 00:29:15,920
You just look so young, Francis.

552
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,827
Let's get you outta here.

553
00:29:18,065 --> 00:29:19,715
I'm shutting this party down !

554
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,709
Everyone go home !

555
00:29:21,956 --> 00:29:24,553
Except for you guys. It's your place.
I need to see your IDs.

556
00:29:24,874 --> 00:29:25,984
Officer, listen...

557
00:29:27,029 --> 00:29:29,058
The fact is we just arrived.

558
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:31,894
Any illegal activity
has nothing to do with us.

559
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,943
And we're in a fraternity.

560
00:29:34,307 --> 00:29:37,400
If we get in any trouble like this,
we could lose our charter.

561
00:29:38,056 --> 00:29:40,778
Should've thought of that before
you involved that innocent donkey.

562
00:29:42,467 --> 00:29:43,781
All right, Cap.

563
00:29:46,182 --> 00:29:48,369
Come on, man, we could lose
our house. For real.

564
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:50,647
Well, that's not
what we intended but...

565
00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:53,124
Seems fitting, don't you think ?

566
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,597
- Are you okay ?
- What ?

567
00:30:10,758 --> 00:30:12,935
- Yeah. Hi.
- Do you want some company ?

568
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:17,413
Why not ?
I guess I've already lost...

569
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,358
Faith ?

570
00:30:19,687 --> 00:30:21,082
Faith Flowers !

571
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:24,790
It's me ! Ash...

572
00:30:24,915 --> 00:30:25,915
Taylor.

573
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,993
- Ashed Aylor ? What a delicious name.
- Thank you !

574
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:31,579
You can call me Ashleigh for short.

575
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,497
I just wanted to say
I'm really sorry

576
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,556
about the whole porn thing.

577
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,814
- What are you talking about ?
- I'm the...

578
00:30:40,525 --> 00:30:41,839
someone you don't know.

579
00:30:42,588 --> 00:30:43,838
But you should.

580
00:30:44,493 --> 00:30:47,889
I'm graduating from CRU in a month.
I've interview for jobs ranging

581
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:51,167
from the assistant to the regional
manager of blah, blah to the junior exec

582
00:30:51,292 --> 00:30:53,688
to the head of "Who Cares".
I don't love any of that.

583
00:30:53,813 --> 00:30:56,777
So I just started to accept
that I was gonna get a job

584
00:30:56,902 --> 00:30:59,565
I didn't love because that's
what people do. Until I met you.

585
00:30:59,895 --> 00:31:02,735
Look at this dress. I made it out
of a couple of really old T-shirts

586
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:05,954
and dresses I had, because,
one, I'm in college and poor,

587
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:09,631
and two, I didn't want to throw them out
and have them sit in a landfill.

588
00:31:09,756 --> 00:31:12,856
So, deconstructed fashion.
It's totally on the rise

589
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:15,624
because of the economy,
because of how green everyone's getting.

590
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:18,042
And I love realizing that.
I love being able

591
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,587
to imagine what the next thing will be,
not just in fashion, but in everything.

592
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:25,356
And the idea of being able to do that,
what I love, and get paid ?

593
00:31:25,481 --> 00:31:28,552
That probably has to be the most
amazing thing anyone can do.

594
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:33,377
What I'm trying to say,
Fairy Job Mother, is that I love you.

595
00:31:33,502 --> 00:31:34,642
I beg your pardon ?

596
00:31:34,994 --> 00:31:37,186
I mean, I love what you do.

597
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,539
And I would love to do what you do.
Or learn from you.

598
00:31:41,664 --> 00:31:43,442
Or get you coffee

599
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,835
or whatever.

600
00:31:46,499 --> 00:31:48,057
What do you say ?

601
00:31:49,698 --> 00:31:52,651
Did you guys witness
any activity with the donkey ?

602
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:57,373
Do something, Chambers.
They're going to shut our house down.

603
00:31:57,541 --> 00:32:01,126
What do you expect me to do ?
They caught us with a freaking donkey.

604
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:02,862
Some president.

605
00:32:05,369 --> 00:32:08,050
- Officer ?
- Trip, why don't you let it alone ?

606
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:09,593
At least he's doing something.

607
00:32:10,478 --> 00:32:11,729
Officer Nixon,

608
00:32:11,854 --> 00:32:14,390
we'd be happy to make a sizable
donation to your department

609
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:16,849
if you were to look the other
way on this whole thing.

610
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,443
Bribery, too ?

611
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,855
Against the wall, Big Red !
You boys are screwed.

612
00:32:26,198 --> 00:32:27,448
Officer Nixon ?

613
00:32:27,806 --> 00:32:29,655
Hi. Can we talk in private ?

614
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,814
I hope he doesn't screw this up.

615
00:32:38,939 --> 00:32:40,874
After Trip, it can't get much worse.

616
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:44,962
We're going to lose our charter,
aren't we ?

617
00:32:49,251 --> 00:32:50,968
Thank you. Thank you so much.

618
00:32:54,525 --> 00:32:56,657
All right, guys. We're good here.

619
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:00,854
Let's go get some pancakes.

620
00:33:04,909 --> 00:33:06,900
- What the hell did you do ?
- I handled it.

621
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:10,779
So let's get our stuff back in here
and resume our spring break !

622
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:15,159
Dude, you got my vote.

623
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:21,790
Way to go, little bro.

624
00:33:22,696 --> 00:33:25,127
Maybe you do have what it takes
to become president of OC.

625
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:27,813
- Well, I learned from the best.
- Thanks, man.

626
00:33:27,938 --> 00:33:31,258
You've shown me how incredibly loyal
and generous someone can be.

627
00:33:33,414 --> 00:33:35,220
But you've also shown me how pride

628
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,723
can... really threaten
to ruin a guy.

629
00:33:38,312 --> 00:33:40,726
It's not your family or your money.

630
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:42,004
It's your pride.

631
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,818
You're gonna lose
Rebecca because of that.

632
00:33:54,994 --> 00:33:56,075
What you doing ?

633
00:33:56,558 --> 00:33:57,826
I am

634
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:01,372
just getting ready for my surprise
birthday party. How about you ?

635
00:34:01,744 --> 00:34:02,998
Did Abby tell you ?

636
00:34:03,702 --> 00:34:06,280
It's a sorority, Ash. Not the CIA.

637
00:34:06,831 --> 00:34:08,962
Good, because I have a secret
that I can't keep !

638
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:11,715
I... got a job !

639
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,634
It's not a job-job, more of

640
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:16,379
an unpaid internship with this woman,
Faith Flowers.

641
00:34:16,836 --> 00:34:18,514
She's a trend forecaster.

642
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:20,849
- What ? That's perfect for you.
- I know !

643
00:34:22,386 --> 00:34:24,038
I'm going to New York !

644
00:34:26,886 --> 00:34:27,886
My God !

645
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:31,527
It's really happening.

646
00:34:32,621 --> 00:34:34,530
Aren't you a little freaked out ?

647
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,117
No. I'm ready.

648
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:44,316
Case, when I started CRU,
I thought I'd just get a degree,

649
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,027
maybe get married.

650
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:47,461
I never...

651
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:50,811
really thought
I wanted that much for myself.

652
00:34:51,912 --> 00:34:52,673
But...

653
00:34:53,623 --> 00:34:57,514
then I met you, and because of you
and because of our friendship...

654
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:02,646
I've come to want more for myself
than I ever could've imagined.

655
00:35:04,697 --> 00:35:06,970
You always go after what you want,

656
00:35:07,463 --> 00:35:09,467
and I'll never forget that.

657
00:35:11,157 --> 00:35:12,443
You're my best friend

658
00:35:12,727 --> 00:35:13,986
and you always will be.

659
00:35:15,763 --> 00:35:18,824
Even if I'm in New York
and you stay in Cyprus.

660
00:35:19,901 --> 00:35:20,951
Wait, you knew ?

661
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,871
Yeah, it's a sorority. Not the CIA.

662
00:35:24,635 --> 00:35:27,583
Maybe I'm not as strong
as you think I am.

663
00:35:27,963 --> 00:35:29,168
Yes, you are.

664
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,414
Maybe you've just taken a vacation
from yourself.

665
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:40,471
Spinning !

666
00:35:40,914 --> 00:35:42,203
Stop the spinning !

667
00:35:43,223 --> 00:35:46,352
I'm so sorry. This is not
what I wanted it to be for us.

668
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,525
It's OK. We can save money
back in Cyprus.

669
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,856
Just say sex.

670
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:53,393
Good lord,
I'm from the South, not France.

671
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,277
Where were you all day ?

672
00:35:55,725 --> 00:35:56,945
This is your fault !

673
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,782
You're like weed.
You're my gateway.

674
00:36:00,064 --> 00:36:01,064
My fault ?

675
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,701
I didn't get you wasted.

676
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:05,245
Why'd you want to come here ?

677
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,004
Well, not for the sand.

678
00:36:09,122 --> 00:36:10,334
I wanted a girl.

679
00:36:10,703 --> 00:36:12,377
And not a landlady.

680
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:15,881
Or some sorority girl
that's too insecure to stick by me.

681
00:36:16,187 --> 00:36:19,593
I wanted to have a real college
experience like you did.

682
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:21,297
And have fun.

683
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,775
Because I only got two years
left to do it.

684
00:36:28,446 --> 00:36:30,854
Should we go get him some coffee,
or something ?

685
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:36,611
You look like <i>Aliens vs. Predator</i>,

686
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,615
but all in one human form.

687
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:43,125
I need you.

688
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,750
I need you, Casey.

689
00:36:47,574 --> 00:36:48,574
What's up ?

690
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,209
I got into law school in Washington.

691
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:53,377
That's great !

692
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,295
It's not, because I'm not going.

693
00:36:55,815 --> 00:36:58,006
I now see why Cappie doesn't want
to graduate.

694
00:36:58,593 --> 00:37:00,884
What if I'm not ready ?
What if I fail ?

695
00:37:01,279 --> 00:37:02,287
You're ready.

696
00:37:02,412 --> 00:37:04,429
There are bigger things
out there for you now.

697
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:07,596
I'll be alone.

698
00:37:07,721 --> 00:37:10,519
Remember when I first came to CRU,
I was terrified.

699
00:37:10,964 --> 00:37:13,188
I was lonely.
I didn't have a world.

700
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,972
But if I had never came here,

701
00:37:15,582 --> 00:37:17,879
I never would've joined
a fraternity.

702
00:37:18,804 --> 00:37:20,738
Met Cappie and all those guys.

703
00:37:21,189 --> 00:37:22,654
Calvin and Dale.

704
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,900
I never would've had the relationship
that I have with you now.

705
00:37:27,342 --> 00:37:29,329
Now I have a whole universe.

706
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:33,125
- Did you ever read Peter Pan ?
- No.

707
00:37:33,411 --> 00:37:35,508
See ?
I've never even read Peter Pan !

708
00:37:35,633 --> 00:37:39,038
I have no business leaving school.
I have to stay.

709
00:37:39,163 --> 00:37:43,141
The first line of Peter Pan is
"All children, except one, grow up."

710
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,442
Wendy knew that at two years old.

711
00:37:45,567 --> 00:37:47,139
You're learning it at 22.

712
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:49,892
Everyone has to grow up.
Nobody's Peter Pan.

713
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:52,436
Not even Cappie.

714
00:37:54,487 --> 00:37:55,729
Dale just threw up.

715
00:38:00,768 --> 00:38:02,253
This is my sister, Casey.

716
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:07,034
I didn't know you have a sister.

717
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:14,625


718
00:38:18,919 --> 00:38:21,861
My God, you should've seen your face !
You were so surprised.

719
00:38:22,562 --> 00:38:24,193
Yes, I was. Thanks, Abby.

720
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,992
There are a lot of really
cute guys here.

721
00:38:31,117 --> 00:38:32,867
You're still on vacation.

722
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:35,428
Not sure my vacation worked out.

723
00:38:35,768 --> 00:38:37,350
So I'm calling it a night.

724
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:42,084
Despite Dale's vomit,
I'm really enjoying Myrtle Beach.

725
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:47,925
Here comes Calvin. No fighting.
We need some BattleBots or something.

726
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:51,227
So ?

727
00:38:52,266 --> 00:38:56,124
Phase four is complete.
Even Trip said he'd vote for me.

728
00:38:56,292 --> 00:39:00,003
Then may Congratulate
the future president of Omega Chi.

729
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,171
- What ?
- As president, I think

730
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,525
my first order of business
will be to declare a truce

731
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:07,928
- between Kappa Tau and Omega Chi.
- Wait, what ? It was all a joke ?

732
00:39:09,437 --> 00:39:11,124
A series of phases, to be exact,

733
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:13,225
concocted by our Revenge Chair.

734
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:16,323
The entire plot was brought to you
by the brotherhood of Kappa Tau.

735
00:39:16,448 --> 00:39:18,948
The mob guy was actually
Brother Rubik's Cube,

736
00:39:19,073 --> 00:39:20,399
Class of '85.

737
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:24,361
The Myrtle Beach cops were Brothers Pez,
Paisley, Tricky Dick and Disco Dan.

738
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:27,572
All KT Brothers from the University
of South Carolina, class of '79.

739
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,140
Brothers for life.

740
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,536
What you gonna do now
that you don't have OC to kick around ?

741
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:33,704
Enjoy life ?

742
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:35,992
I saw Lambda Sig looking at me
funny last week.

743
00:39:36,117 --> 00:39:38,375
I didn't care for that.
I'm go get to the bottom of it.

744
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,832
- How about we go on that walk now ?
- Okay. Yeah.

745
00:39:52,959 --> 00:39:54,877
Rebecca ! Wait, wait, listen !

746
00:39:55,002 --> 00:39:56,002
I'm...

747
00:40:00,048 --> 00:40:00,981
You're what ?

748
00:40:01,337 --> 00:40:02,626
I'm not the good guy.

749
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:06,028
I don't always do the right thing
all the time.

750
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:08,990
And I'm always blaming my parents
or the money.

751
00:40:09,828 --> 00:40:12,117
But the only person to blame
is myself.

752
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:13,827
I let my pride get in the way

753
00:40:14,543 --> 00:40:15,954
I don't want to lose you.

754
00:40:19,473 --> 00:40:21,242
You can forget what a mess I am ?

755
00:40:22,484 --> 00:40:24,043
You cheated on me

756
00:40:24,168 --> 00:40:27,174
because you don't believe you
deserve happiness, but you do.

757
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,260
I do.

758
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,167
And we can find that together.

759
00:40:33,468 --> 00:40:34,687
I'd like to try.

760
00:40:41,592 --> 00:40:43,557
So, I've been...

761
00:40:44,053 --> 00:40:46,860
waiting for the perfect moment
to give you something, and...

762
00:40:48,788 --> 00:40:51,239
I think now's as good a time as any.

763
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,699
What is it ?

764
00:41:00,462 --> 00:41:02,161
I want you to wear my lavaliere.

765
00:41:02,923 --> 00:41:04,212
I love you, Casey.

766
00:41:05,419 --> 00:41:06,630
I love you, too.

767
00:41:07,118 --> 00:41:10,342
You're not as excited as I thought you'd
be. Is it because of where it's been ?

768
00:41:10,751 --> 00:41:11,583
What ?

769
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,804
No, it's just...

770
00:41:14,782 --> 00:41:17,349
I didn't bungee jump today
because I was scared.

771
00:41:18,286 --> 00:41:21,686
And if I stay in Cyprus,
I'd be staying because I'm scared.

772
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,110
You're going to Washington,
aren't you ?

773
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:31,863
I have to do what's best for me,
and that's law school.

774
00:41:32,197 --> 00:41:34,377
Don't you want me to go
and succeed ?

775
00:41:34,752 --> 00:41:35,617
I do.

776
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:39,381
I guess I'm being selfish because
I know that means I'm gonna lose you.

777
00:41:41,197 --> 00:41:44,167
Cap, you can come with me !
To Washington ! You could transfer...

778
00:41:44,522 --> 00:41:45,836
I'm not sure I can leave.

779
00:41:46,248 --> 00:41:47,420
And I can't stay.

780
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,047
But, I totally understand

781
00:41:49,334 --> 00:41:50,787
why you're scared to go.

782
00:41:51,338 --> 00:41:52,342
I'm not scared.

783
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,510
That's okay.
Leaving something can be terrifying.

784
00:41:55,663 --> 00:41:57,931
Is that what you're doing ?
Are you leaving me behind ?

785
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:00,767
- I want us to move forward, together !
- I don't want to move forward !

786
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,645
- Because you don't want to grow up.
- What other choice do we have ?

787
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,711
We are two different people

788
00:42:10,836 --> 00:42:13,738
who love each other very much.
It seems like the only place

789
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:16,158
where our differences
don't matter is in college.

790
00:42:17,919 --> 00:42:20,495
Maybe this is just one
of those college relationships ?

791
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,448
If it is, it's the best one...

792
00:42:23,481 --> 00:42:24,448
of all time.

793
00:42:26,869 --> 00:42:27,919
Look, let's just

794
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,927
finish the year out together, and...

795
00:42:30,052 --> 00:42:32,189
No, screw it.
You know what ? Why wait ?

796
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,136
If you don't have more faith in us
than that ? Then we should break up now.

797
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:39,264
- No, I don't want to.
- Too late. It's done. All right ?

798
00:42:39,862 --> 00:42:42,309
I can't believe I was gonna
give this to you tonight.

799
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:44,769
I would've felt pretty college
doing something like that.

800
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,146
Cappie, please...

801
00:42:49,555 --> 00:42:52,705
<i>Merci d'avoir suivi cette saison
avec la Kappa Team.</i>
