1
00:00:01,654 --> 00:00:03,628
We'd like to congratulate
Russell Cartwright

2
00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:05,586
on being this year's
grant recipient.

3
00:00:05,711 --> 00:00:08,017
Rusty ? It's Dana.
We met at orientation.

4
00:00:08,142 --> 00:00:10,515
Did you know that I've had
a crush on you since we met ?

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,553
I liked you even when
you were the Anchor.

6
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,472
I could buy you a cup of coffee ?

7
00:00:16,607 --> 00:00:18,939
Are you freaking kidding me ?
You blew it.

8
00:00:19,064 --> 00:00:21,235
There's nothing you can say.
We were all friends again.

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,481
- Why did you have to screw it up ?
- You screwed it up

10
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:25,462
by getting back together
with Cappie.

11
00:00:25,587 --> 00:00:28,694
I'm not going to apologize for
doing what I had to do for my house.

12
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,946
My house would never ask
me to screw people.

13
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,282
No, you're just a bunch of
losers while the rest of us,

14
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,785
including your girlfriend,
have real lives.

15
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:38,621
When am I supposed to compromise
what I want for a relationship ?

16
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:41,207
This is gonna be
trickier than I thought.

17
00:00:44,403 --> 00:00:45,628
Thanks for breakfast.

18
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:48,798
- Who says guys can't cook ?
- This is amazing !

19
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,815
Yeah, it's just
this little something

20
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,885
I threw together called Fruity Cocoa
Cinnamon Sugar Frosted

21
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,834
Honey Marshmallow Berry Waffle Pops,

22
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:58,094
- with Clusters.
- I was talking about this article

23
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:01,075
on Paula Baker's bill limiting carbon
emissions. I worked on that bill

24
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,904
- as an intern.
- "Worked on" ?

25
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:06,816
I made copies of it, but something
I was a part of is actually going

26
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:09,318
to the President of the
United States to become a law !

27
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,770
I painted flames on my turtle.

28
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:15,716
- That's pretty.
- He's not supposed to be pretty.

29
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:18,202
He's supposed to be
awesome and intimidating.

30
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:22,123
Aren't you, Little
Earnhardt, Junior...

31
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:24,569
Junior.

32
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:27,440
The KT 500 is about to begin.

33
00:01:27,565 --> 00:01:29,463
Turtles, to your starting gates !

34
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,634
I glued nunchucks on mine
and named him Michelangelo.

35
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,470
Well, we're gonna kick
your Teenage Mutant Ninja ass.

36
00:01:38,464 --> 00:01:40,143
It'd be so awesome to be there

37
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:42,560
and be a part of the
process, making laws.

38
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:46,737
You know, I thought you had
a bad time in Washington.

39
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,635
Fetching coffee, making copies.
They called you Elle Woods.

40
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,152
Yes, I remember, thank you.

41
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:53,703
But just because some people
in Paula's office

42
00:01:53,828 --> 00:01:56,365
saw me as a vapid sorority girl
doesn't mean I should give up.

43
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,827
It means I have to work harder
to prove that's not me.

44
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,852
Good for you.
You know who else won't give up ?

45
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:03,372
Little Earnhardt Junior

46
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,379
Junior.

47
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:08,335
I need to focus on my future.

48
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,508
Graduation's coming up
and then... and then...

49
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,722
- The turtle race is about to start.
- Don't wanna miss that green flag.

50
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,225
Sweet Mother of Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio,

51
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,084
is that the new Magtromex
digital microscope ?

52
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,577
- I didn't even know it was out yet !
- Pretty great ?

53
00:02:51,702 --> 00:02:54,006
Thanks to your grant money,
the new lab'd be hooked up,

54
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,883
- this is like your own Bat Cave !
- And you can use any of it

55
00:02:57,008 --> 00:02:58,385
whenever you want.

56
00:02:59,936 --> 00:03:01,391
I may take you up on that.

57
00:03:01,516 --> 00:03:03,662
Especially since I'm funding
my own research now,

58
00:03:03,787 --> 00:03:05,480
and not saving as much as I'd hoped,

59
00:03:05,605 --> 00:03:08,312
although I did award myself the
first annual Kettlewell Prize.

60
00:03:09,062 --> 00:03:10,898
- Congratulations ?
- It's underfunded.

61
00:03:11,496 --> 00:03:14,109
Looks like I'll be
entering the work force.

62
00:03:14,393 --> 00:03:15,329
Good morning.

63
00:03:15,454 --> 00:03:18,235
Hello, person who's wasting
Cartwright's time.

64
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,025
Actually, I've made some
pretty good progress so far.

65
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,702
I got the wire to re-conduct
for five minutes.

66
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,830
You must be proud
of your little protg.

67
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:29,426
Behind every great man...
is a great roommate.

68
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,544
You're still here ?

69
00:03:32,194 --> 00:03:34,652
You need to dig up a jacket
and tie by tonight.

70
00:03:34,777 --> 00:03:37,927
- What for ?
- It's time for your moment in the sun.

71
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,678
It seems that... someone

72
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:44,139
talked up our Gary Wyatt Grant winner
at the department meeting.

73
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:48,310
The dean of the Engineering school
wants to meet CRU's new wunderkind.

74
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,328
The dean wants to meet me ?

75
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,259
What about the winner
of the Kettlewell Prize ?

76
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:56,534
Would the dean like to meet him ?

77
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:58,738
He will.

78
00:04:13,278 --> 00:04:15,578
Ash, there's lipstick on this glass.

79
00:04:16,216 --> 00:04:19,550
- Eight hour no-smear is such a sham.
- I'm not wearing any.

80
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,552
You said you were going
to hire a new hasher.

81
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,686
I'm still a little gun-shy
from the whole Fisher fiasco,

82
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:27,340
but I will get to it.
Eventually.

83
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,521
Abby, if you have to go to
the bathroom, you can just go.

84
00:04:32,885 --> 00:04:35,190
No, I'll do it. I'd be happy
to find us a new hasher.

85
00:04:41,146 --> 00:04:43,616
Ash, just let her, please.

86
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,172
OK, fine. Thanks, Abby.

87
00:04:47,297 --> 00:04:49,497
Great ! I'll start making flyers !

88
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,466
Sometimes I really like her
and sometimes I feel like

89
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:56,098
- she might try to kill us in our sleep.
- Forget about that.

90
00:04:56,223 --> 00:04:58,470
I have an important question to ask.

91
00:04:58,595 --> 00:05:00,045
Would you rather...

92
00:05:01,196 --> 00:05:04,946
have a potato chip from this bag...
Crunchy, crunchy, crunchy...

93
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,453
or from that bag that's red ?

94
00:05:07,578 --> 00:05:10,426
Obviously, you want
me to pick the crunchy one.

95
00:05:10,551 --> 00:05:12,895
- Why ?
- It's for my retail marketing class.

96
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:16,523
My theory is that people'd rather go
for crunch than what the bag looks like.

97
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,944
I'll put you down in the
"prefers crunch" category.

98
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:22,362
I'm so happy that you decided to
go into marketing after college.

99
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:25,240
I'm actually thinking about
going back to Washington.

100
00:05:25,697 --> 00:05:28,155
- That's great !
- I brought it up with Cappie.

101
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,220
You and Cappie actually had a
conversation about graduation ?

102
00:05:31,345 --> 00:05:33,582
I wouldn't actually
call it a conversation.

103
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,057
We haven't talked about it
since we got back together.

104
00:05:36,182 --> 00:05:38,132
He hasn't even said the word.

105
00:05:38,565 --> 00:05:40,635
You have to live
your own life, Casey.

106
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,564
You have to go after what you
want and not worry about him.

107
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:46,343
I don't know where to begin
if I go back to Washington.

108
00:05:46,468 --> 00:05:48,467
Paula Baker's office saw me as Elle
Woods,

109
00:05:48,592 --> 00:05:50,037
so that's not an option.

110
00:05:50,162 --> 00:05:53,060
There's someone you could talk
to who knows about Washington,

111
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:54,895
whose dad was a senator,

112
00:05:55,178 --> 00:05:56,078
who's...

113
00:05:57,898 --> 00:05:59,441
We need a new hasher, stat !

114
00:05:59,882 --> 00:06:02,444
I just found some leftovers in
the fridge. They're Frannie's.

115
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:10,070
I can't believe I'm here.

116
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:12,697
I keep thinking about all the Ph. D's
that walked through that door.

117
00:06:12,822 --> 00:06:15,551
Stay focused. You're meeting
the dean of the department,

118
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:17,583
not Justin Guarini
from the American Idols.

119
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,981
It's OK. I prepared
an amusing anecdote

120
00:06:20,106 --> 00:06:22,451
to tell the dean how I got
my inspiration from watching

121
00:06:22,576 --> 00:06:24,857
- my fraternity brothers shoot pool.
- No, you didn't.

122
00:06:24,982 --> 00:06:27,594
Don't talk about your frat house
or toga parties or beer bongs.

123
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,563
I'm not gonna embarrass...

124
00:06:30,694 --> 00:06:31,894
Hello, Milton.

125
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:34,494
This must be our new wunderkind.

126
00:06:34,619 --> 00:06:36,537
Dr. Lundquist, Rusty Cartwright.

127
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:39,732
- It's such an honor to meet you, sir.
- I'm the one who should be honored.

128
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,857
Your wire is
the talk of the department.

129
00:06:41,982 --> 00:06:42,776
Thank you.

130
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:44,903
I'm always interested
in where ideas come from.

131
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,012
Where did you get the inspiration
for your breakthrough ?

132
00:06:48,137 --> 00:06:49,487
From these balls.

133
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,479
They weren't actually mine.
I was holding on to someone else's.

134
00:06:53,604 --> 00:06:55,164
They were my brother's balls.

135
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,082
The balls of my fraternity brothers.

136
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:00,210
They were pool balls, sir.

137
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,504
Combo shot led me to use
the cross-linker.

138
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,772
Fascinating.

139
00:07:05,548 --> 00:07:08,747
You know, your discovery could mean
big things on CRU, very big things.

140
00:07:08,872 --> 00:07:10,971
Attracting higher enrollment,
increased endowments.

141
00:07:11,277 --> 00:07:12,514
It lets us say,

142
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,808
"Suck it, MIT.
We got Rusty Cartwright."

143
00:07:16,739 --> 00:07:18,132
I need to tell the trustees

144
00:07:18,257 --> 00:07:20,932
about our major breakthrough
at the budget meeting next month.

145
00:07:21,057 --> 00:07:23,817
Do you think you could have some
patent-ready diagrams by then ?

146
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,361
That's a little fast.
We just started working...

147
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,983
He's being modest.
He was just telling me

148
00:07:29,108 --> 00:07:31,896
he's making real progress,
weren't you, Cartwright ?

149
00:07:32,021 --> 00:07:33,898
I knew we could
count on our wunderkind.

150
00:07:34,023 --> 00:07:36,205
Now, let me introduce
the department heads.

151
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:39,223
They are dying to meet
their future colleague.

152
00:07:45,287 --> 00:07:46,799
What is going on here ?

153
00:07:47,323 --> 00:07:51,011
We're here for the hasher job.
You're Ashleigh, right ?

154
00:07:52,474 --> 00:07:54,844
- I'm Hunter.
- Hell no.

155
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,630
What is going on here ?

156
00:07:58,755 --> 00:08:00,762
It looks like GQ
crashed into Men's Health

157
00:08:00,887 --> 00:08:03,166
and spilled hot guys
all over our living room.

158
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:06,318
Apparently the word was out about you
and the last hasher hooking up,

159
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:10,347
so a lot of the guys want the job.
These are the ones I really want...

160
00:08:10,472 --> 00:08:11,365
for the job.

161
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,479
Just because you have issues

162
00:08:13,604 --> 00:08:16,452
doesn't mean the rest of us shouldn't
have our chance at a hasher hookup.

163
00:08:16,795 --> 00:08:20,295
Excuse me, I'm looking for Casey.
She's not here right now.

164
00:08:20,924 --> 00:08:24,753
I suppose I can talk to you, then.
I'm here about the flier.

165
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,540
The hasher job.

166
00:08:26,665 --> 00:08:29,338
I do have experience.
I waited tables at Bible camp.

167
00:08:29,463 --> 00:08:32,860
And back home
I cleaned up actual pigsties.

168
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,988
You're Rusty's funny friend, Kyle.

169
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,143
Once again, Dale.

170
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:43,856
I have a reference here from my boss
one summer at Tacos and Donuts.

171
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,761
It was only for a couple of weeks.

172
00:08:45,886 --> 00:08:48,472
They needed replacement dishwashers
after this INS raid,

173
00:08:48,597 --> 00:08:51,488
- but they let on that...
- You're hired.

174
00:08:53,155 --> 00:08:54,867
- Congratulations.
- Great.

175
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,496
Professor Hastings.

176
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,593
The wunderkind.
Beats being the Anchor, doesn't it ?

177
00:09:02,718 --> 00:09:05,216
That was amazing.
I'm practically on a first-name basis

178
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:07,963
with three doctoral candidates
and a Nobel Prize winner.

179
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:11,465
Do you think we can be patent-ready
in a month like we promised Teddy ?

180
00:09:13,935 --> 00:09:16,298
- Dr. Lundquist.
- You're going to have to be.

181
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:17,931
You're in the big leagues now.

182
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,809
But just to be sure, I thought you
might be able to use some help.

183
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,145
So I arranged
for an outstanding student

184
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,953
from my advanced physics class
to assist you.

185
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:29,578
Really ? An assistant ?
I've never had an assistant before.

186
00:09:29,724 --> 00:09:32,738
Here she is now.
Cartwright, meet Stockwell.

187
00:09:36,895 --> 00:09:38,845
Actually, we know each other.

188
00:09:40,086 --> 00:09:41,413
Is she asking me ?

189
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,666
The way her inflection
went up at the end there,

190
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,668
- it sounded like a question.
- We kinda met before.

191
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,378
I get that you want to work
in Washington.

192
00:09:53,503 --> 00:09:55,702
- The question is "Why ?"
- What do you mean ?

193
00:09:55,827 --> 00:09:59,326
DC's a dark place full of bad, selfish
people who have no interest in anything

194
00:09:59,451 --> 00:10:02,601
- but corruption and blind power.
- I don't believe it's all like that.

195
00:10:04,947 --> 00:10:05,947
Hi ! Dale.

196
00:10:06,525 --> 00:10:10,359
Ashleigh waits a month to find a new
hasher and then hires Bible Boy.

197
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,111
You're unpleasant.
I prepared a shopping list.

198
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,679
If there's anything special you'd like,
let me know.

199
00:10:15,804 --> 00:10:19,505
I might whip up a batch of my
Aunt Gertie's, award-winning vinegar pie

200
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,953
- just for you.
- Great.

201
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,498
- That sounds disgusting.
- Wasn't offering any to you.

202
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,041
Anyway, have a blessed day, Case.

203
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:30,183
Guess Ashleigh and I
won't be fighting over this one.

204
00:10:30,308 --> 00:10:32,647
So, let's assume, for a second,
that Washington

205
00:10:32,772 --> 00:10:35,125
isn't all a cesspool.
What do you want to do there ?

206
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,220
Be a lobbyist, work for a federal
agency, play for the Redskins ?

207
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,930
Lobbyist could be interesting.

208
00:10:40,896 --> 00:10:43,225
You want to be a whore ?
That's what most of them are.

209
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,270
You have to wine and dine politicians,
sometimes more.

210
00:10:46,651 --> 00:10:49,187
It wouldn't be like that.
I'd work for an environmental group.

211
00:10:49,312 --> 00:10:50,954
So you'd be a green whore ?

212
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:53,234
How PC.
Maybe they could pay you in weed.

213
00:10:53,662 --> 00:10:54,812
The truth is,

214
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:57,989
I really want to work
on new legislation, making laws.

215
00:10:58,178 --> 00:11:01,753
Unless you're running for office
and that 16-year-old you slept with

216
00:11:01,878 --> 00:11:04,955
or the Psi Phi Pi brownies
could be teensy problems.

217
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,699
- You should probably start in Congress.
- How do I do that ?

218
00:11:07,824 --> 00:11:10,216
I might know someone you could talk to
but you'd owe me.

219
00:11:10,341 --> 00:11:12,557
Seriously you wouldn't do me a favor
this one time

220
00:11:12,682 --> 00:11:15,132
- without expecting something in return ?
- Nope.

221
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,150
That's your first lesson.
Welcome to politics.

222
00:11:23,527 --> 00:11:26,026
Could you hand me
the microthermometer ?

223
00:11:26,151 --> 00:11:28,562
Did you ever check the throughput
on this fraction collector ?

224
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,562
Yes. The microthermometer, please ?

225
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,857
You should probably check it again.

226
00:11:32,982 --> 00:11:36,315
You know, you're the assistant.
You're supposed to assist me.

227
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,840
Right, because
you're Mr. Wunderkind.

228
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:39,823
Big whoop.

229
00:11:40,758 --> 00:11:43,758
According to the dean,
it's a fairly large whoop.

230
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:48,789
Look, I realize this is awkward
but we're gonna have to work through it.

231
00:11:49,196 --> 00:11:51,482
- Why is it awkward ?
- Because you said you liked me,

232
00:11:51,607 --> 00:11:54,890
and I didn't remember you, then
I asked you out and you blew me off.

233
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,140
Right.

234
00:11:57,265 --> 00:11:59,565
Now I see why it's awkward, for you.

235
00:12:02,023 --> 00:12:03,805
This is a big deal for me.

236
00:12:03,993 --> 00:12:05,797
It wasn't too long ago
I was the Anchor

237
00:12:05,922 --> 00:12:08,313
and now I'm about to have my name
on a patent.

238
00:12:08,438 --> 00:12:10,465
I appreciate your help,

239
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:13,866
but we have to focus and work quickly
if we're going to get this done on time,

240
00:12:13,991 --> 00:12:16,741
and it would be great
if we could get along.

241
00:12:16,895 --> 00:12:20,030
- Are you trying to ask me out again ?
- You want me to ask you out again ?

242
00:12:20,218 --> 00:12:22,340
It wouldn't be appropriate,
would it ?

243
00:12:22,465 --> 00:12:25,118
- I mean, I am your assistant.
- Right.

244
00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:28,289
So could you hand me
the microthermometer ?

245
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,192
Will you please stop doing that ?

246
00:12:38,195 --> 00:12:40,479
If anybody knows his way
inside the Beltway it's Joel.

247
00:12:40,604 --> 00:12:42,614
He did a lot of heavy lifting
 for my father.

248
00:12:42,739 --> 00:12:44,589
He worked for your father ?

249
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,844
Just because he worked for my
dad doesn't make him a slimeball.

250
00:12:47,969 --> 00:12:49,319
He's a do-gooder.

251
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,087
How's your dad ?

252
00:12:56,212 --> 00:12:58,944
You know, trying to fall back in love
with my mom

253
00:12:59,132 --> 00:13:01,782
by never being in the same state
with her.

254
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,532
This is my...

255
00:13:06,248 --> 00:13:09,215
She wants to work in the cesspool
of lies and greed known as Washington.

256
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,748
I tried to talk her out of it.
Maybe she'll listen to you.

257
00:13:11,936 --> 00:13:15,460
I think politics gets a bad rap.
A lot of good comes out of Washington.

258
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:18,839
- You want to barf, right ?
- Same old Rebecca.

259
00:13:19,442 --> 00:13:21,477
So, tell me what you've been doing.

260
00:13:21,696 --> 00:13:23,846
What makes you think
that you want to work in DC ?

261
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:27,325
I just feel like I have something
to contribute.

262
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,599
It's why I kind of ran
for ZBZ President,

263
00:13:29,787 --> 00:13:33,355
why I've been working on Panhellenic
and why I interned for Paula Baker.

264
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,371
It sounds like
you're on the right track,

265
00:13:35,496 --> 00:13:38,269
although it never hurts to have
more experience for those Hill jobs.

266
00:13:38,394 --> 00:13:40,735
- Like working on a campaign ?
- Among other things.

267
00:13:40,923 --> 00:13:42,997
We always need help
with voter registration.

268
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:46,074
We're trying to target college students,
get them involved in the process.

269
00:13:46,262 --> 00:13:48,590
-  You'd be interested in ?
- Getting signatures ?

270
00:13:48,715 --> 00:13:49,705
I can do that.

271
00:13:49,932 --> 00:13:51,732
Great. I'll get the forms.

272
00:13:52,924 --> 00:13:54,443
This is exciting.

273
00:13:54,687 --> 00:13:58,487
Do little cartoon birds hold up
your robe for you every morning ?

274
00:14:04,151 --> 00:14:06,001
Ashleigh, I got a question.

275
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,137
Yes, Dale, I've heard the good word.

276
00:14:08,262 --> 00:14:10,015
Not my question,
but glad to hear it.

277
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,976
I thought it'd be nice to
spruce up dinner tonight,

278
00:14:13,164 --> 00:14:16,169
and since I did take a napkin
folding class at Christian manners camp,

279
00:14:16,294 --> 00:14:17,314
I was wondering

280
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:21,132
would you prefer the bird of paradise
or the goblet fan fold ?

281
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,234
Good one.

282
00:14:26,853 --> 00:14:27,991
The bird ?

283
00:14:29,692 --> 00:14:30,980
Excellent choice.

284
00:14:37,881 --> 00:14:40,131
Billy Graham Cracker has got to go.

285
00:14:40,256 --> 00:14:42,676
What do you mean ?
The house is already cleaner,

286
00:14:42,801 --> 00:14:46,240
the pantry is stocked for the first time
in weeks and he made a little bird.

287
00:14:46,365 --> 00:14:48,540
He put psalms in the cereal boxes

288
00:14:48,665 --> 00:14:51,264
and instead of pouring the pretzels
into bowls

289
00:14:51,452 --> 00:14:53,099
he lays them out in little crosses.

290
00:14:53,287 --> 00:14:55,547
Yeah, so, he's a little religious.

291
00:14:55,845 --> 00:14:57,604
What we're trying to say is,

292
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:00,774
although we understand
how Dale suits you and your issue,

293
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,679
the house would be
much better served

294
00:15:02,804 --> 00:15:05,158
with someone that's more in sync
with the rest of us,

295
00:15:05,283 --> 00:15:07,759
someone that's more responsive
to our needs...

296
00:15:07,884 --> 00:15:10,422
Someone hotter
that we can totally hook up with.

297
00:15:10,547 --> 00:15:12,788
Someone... not Dale.

298
00:15:14,434 --> 00:15:15,162
No.

299
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,551
Have you registered to vote ?
How about you ?

300
00:15:23,676 --> 00:15:26,076
- No, thanks.
- It's your civic duty.

301
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,554
- How's it going ?
- Not great.

302
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:33,420
People don't know why they should
register, why they should now

303
00:15:33,545 --> 00:15:35,475
or they think I'm
a front for Scientology.

304
00:15:35,993 --> 00:15:38,395
It was  easier getting signatures
for the Undie Run.

305
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,107
You're telling me college students are
more into getting naked than voting ?

306
00:15:42,295 --> 00:15:43,275
I'm shocked.

307
00:15:44,969 --> 00:15:47,737
Rebecca told me about your plans
to work in Washington.

308
00:15:47,925 --> 00:15:50,222
You're not the only one
with political aspirations.

309
00:15:50,347 --> 00:15:52,633
- I think that's great, Case.
- Thank you, Evan.

310
00:15:52,758 --> 00:15:55,745
I'm glad to see that your personal
life is not holding you back.

311
00:15:56,738 --> 00:15:58,038
Thank you, Evan.

312
00:15:58,544 --> 00:16:00,708
- I think you're both delusional.
- Could be.

313
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,277
I gotta get to class.
See you later ?

314
00:16:07,146 --> 00:16:09,217
Looks like you and
Evan are going strong.

315
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,720
- Are we really gonna do this ?
- Apparently not.

316
00:16:11,908 --> 00:16:13,722
We need to talk about
your sales technique.

317
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,140
What's wrong with it ?

318
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,304
Are you kidding ?
Politics is all about scare tactics.

319
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,904
Didn't you learn anything
from the Bush years ?

320
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:25,578
Watch and learn.

321
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,765
If I don't register to vote
they're gonna bring back the draft,

322
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,322
and they're taking girls ?

323
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,700
Where do I sign ?

324
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,287
Impressive.

325
00:16:37,781 --> 00:16:40,051
And thank you again
for introducing me to Joel.

326
00:16:40,176 --> 00:16:42,854
You should thank me.
After the election he's going back to DC

327
00:16:42,979 --> 00:16:45,047
as the representative's
chief of staff...

328
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:47,464
Which means he's in charge
of hiring legislative aides.

329
00:16:47,652 --> 00:16:50,628
Which means if I impress him,
then I could get one of those jobs.

330
00:16:50,753 --> 00:16:53,331
And Cappie could open up
a DC chapter of Kappa Tau.

331
00:16:53,456 --> 00:16:55,847
- We haven't talked about it.
- Good luck with that.

332
00:16:58,204 --> 00:17:00,060
All right, you try these guys.

333
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,271
Register to vote,

334
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:04,628
or... they

335
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,313
might outlaw porn.

336
00:17:16,626 --> 00:17:17,362
Go !

337
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,187
Come on !

338
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:22,127
Have any of you guys
seen my project notebook ?

339
00:17:22,252 --> 00:17:24,166
You're missing all the excitement.

340
00:17:24,482 --> 00:17:26,378
There's the crowds, the crashes.

341
00:17:26,996 --> 00:17:29,543
It's even better than last
year's record-setting pace.

342
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,435
I think my turtle died.

343
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,220
No, just pooped.

344
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,674
Maybe the lighter weight
will speed him up.

345
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,250
Less wind resistance.

346
00:17:39,578 --> 00:17:41,893
Or maybe that's just
part of his strategy,

347
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:45,684
like James Bond, so everyone behind
him'll spin out on his poop slick.

348
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,550
See what you're missing ?

349
00:17:47,948 --> 00:17:50,025
Actually, I was
gonna ask you something.

350
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,551
Has Casey mentioned anything
to you about me and her

351
00:17:52,676 --> 00:17:53,410
or...

352
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:54,956
the "G" word ?

353
00:17:55,734 --> 00:17:58,179
I don't think it's appropriate
to talk about that part

354
00:17:58,304 --> 00:17:59,661
of my sister's anatomy.

355
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,071
No, I'm talking
black gowns, tassels...

356
00:18:02,546 --> 00:18:04,874
Seriously, Cap, I don't
want to talk about that.

357
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,550
- You mean graduation ?
- Yeah, that.

358
00:18:08,675 --> 00:18:11,548
I never understood the appeal.
Why would I want to leave ?

359
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,259
My favorite coffee place is here,
my friends are here.

360
00:18:14,587 --> 00:18:16,591
The weather never seems to change.

361
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,346
It won't always be that way.

362
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:21,683
I know. The sun will eventually
burn out, leaving the Earth a cold,

363
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:24,602
lifeless cinder, but I figure
by then I'get a scarf.

364
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,063
I mean, your friends
won't always be here.

365
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,732
People are going to move on.

366
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,068
Remember how you felt
losing Wade, almost Heath ?

367
00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:35,248
Casey's gonna graduate in May.

368
00:18:35,525 --> 00:18:38,283
Thought you talked about this
before you got back together.

369
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,455
There it is.

370
00:18:43,185 --> 00:18:44,050
Sorry.

371
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:48,877
- That's the thing, we didn't.
- One second, one second.

372
00:18:50,206 --> 00:18:52,720
Hi, Professor Hastings.
I was just on my way back...

373
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,241
Yeah.

374
00:18:55,745 --> 00:18:57,746
You're kidding me.
It's gonna happen ?

375
00:18:58,368 --> 00:19:00,558
OK, I'll be back.
Sure. OK.

376
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,433
- Good news ?
- There's gonna be an article about me,

377
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,393
with photos, interviews,
the whole deal.

378
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,533
The university is sending a
photographer to take my picture today.

379
00:19:08,744 --> 00:19:10,315
I'm gonna be in EW.

380
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,466
EW ?

381
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,077
- Spitter's gonna be in
Entertainment Weekly.

382
00:19:15,202 --> 00:19:16,083
Awesome.

383
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:17,822
Engineering Weekly.

384
00:19:18,675 --> 00:19:19,658
Never mind.

385
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:25,472
- Still, good.
- All right, I gotta get going.

386
00:19:30,819 --> 00:19:32,879
- You look good for the photo.
- Thanks.

387
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:35,878
You know who else has been in EW ?
People like Carl Sagan,

388
00:19:36,146 --> 00:19:38,900
Stephen Hawking,
and now Rusty Cartwright.

389
00:19:39,025 --> 00:19:40,386
It's hard to believe.

390
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,548
Yes, it is.

391
00:19:42,651 --> 00:19:44,900
So how's that new
hasher job going for you ?

392
00:19:45,205 --> 00:19:47,802
It's good.
It's amazing what slobs

393
00:19:47,927 --> 00:19:50,395
sorority girls can be,
but it's good.

394
00:19:51,045 --> 00:19:54,772
I thought Ashleigh was never gonna hire
anybody after the whole Fisher thing.

395
00:19:54,897 --> 00:19:56,098
Who's Fisher ?

396
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:59,095
He's the guy who had the job
before you when they were dating.

397
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,957
They had an intimate relationship ?

398
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:03,544
Until they broke up,
and then she fired him.

399
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,845
- What ?!
- I'm sorry I'm late.

400
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,513
I'll catch up with you later.

401
00:20:13,686 --> 00:20:15,342
Have you been waiting long ?

402
00:20:15,911 --> 00:20:16,631
No.

403
00:20:16,871 --> 00:20:18,469
I just got hair... here.

404
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,458
Go ahead and laugh, but
I'll be the one laughing

405
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:25,471
when my ex-partner sees this in EW. This
is how I would've looked 20 years ago

406
00:20:25,596 --> 00:20:28,059
if I got the credit I deserved
for our miniature hard drive.

407
00:20:28,247 --> 00:20:30,687
- You would've had a toupee ?
- I would've had my hair !

408
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,747
Along with everything else

409
00:20:32,872 --> 00:20:34,899
The success,
the respect of our peers,

410
00:20:35,087 --> 00:20:36,644
the Victoria's Secret model.

411
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:40,029
This is just the beginning for us.
First EW, then Charlie Rose,

412
00:20:40,217 --> 00:20:42,198
and after that, who knows ? Nova ?

413
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:45,368
We don't even have a wire that
lasts longer than five minutes.

414
00:20:45,556 --> 00:20:48,466
Then I suggest you
make that happen ASAP.

415
00:20:48,851 --> 00:20:51,110
Everyone's counting
on you, Cartwright.

416
00:20:51,896 --> 00:20:54,252
OK, guys, let's
get ready for the picture.

417
00:20:57,417 --> 00:20:58,981
Move in a little closer.

418
00:21:04,374 --> 00:21:05,168
Thanks.

419
00:21:06,957 --> 00:21:09,212
Whoa ! Are those all
new voter registrations ?

420
00:21:09,445 --> 00:21:11,119
Yep. And I already edited out

421
00:21:11,244 --> 00:21:14,889
all the Eileen Dovers
and Ivana Nailors.

422
00:21:15,285 --> 00:21:18,184
- So they're pretty much good to go.
- You're really good at this.

423
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:21,767
It's amazing what you can accomplish when
you speak to what's important to people.

424
00:21:21,892 --> 00:21:24,960
It's kind of how I felt working for
Paula Baker on the carbon emissions bill

425
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:27,418
I didn't know you worked
on the Baker bill.

426
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,531
Well, I was just happy to see it

427
00:21:31,656 --> 00:21:34,876
made it out of conference committee
without a lot of amendments.

428
00:21:36,936 --> 00:21:39,213
Me, too. It's a good
piece of legislation.

429
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:42,338
Let me know if you want to do
some more campus registrations.

430
00:21:42,463 --> 00:21:45,820
Actually, I had this idea to get a
lot of new student voters all at once.

431
00:21:45,945 --> 00:21:48,144
There's this bar
near campus called Dobler's...

432
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:50,926
I went to law school at CRU.
I'm familiar with Dobler's,

433
00:21:51,051 --> 00:21:52,393
perhaps too familiar.

434
00:21:52,581 --> 00:21:55,563
I was thinking that we could throw
a big voter registration party

435
00:21:55,688 --> 00:21:57,809
with this organization called
"Do Something",

436
00:21:57,934 --> 00:22:00,964
that promotes students getting involved.
We could offer a free cover

437
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:02,320
for every new voter.

438
00:22:02,882 --> 00:22:06,866
You know, that is a really good idea. If
you could pull that off, it'd be great.

439
00:22:07,137 --> 00:22:08,947
Better than great,
it'd be fantastic.

440
00:22:09,072 --> 00:22:12,330
- Maybe even impressive ?
- Are you kidding ? Big time.

441
00:22:16,909 --> 00:22:17,903
So, Dale...

442
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:19,900
Hi.

443
00:22:20,832 --> 00:22:22,857
- Shiny.
- Drop the act, Ashleigh.

444
00:22:22,982 --> 00:22:24,509
I know what this is all about.

445
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,187
You do ?

446
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:28,874
I know the real reason you hired me.

447
00:22:31,856 --> 00:22:33,793
Dale, I don't know what to say. I...

448
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:37,202
I heard about what happened with my
predecessor and it's pretty clear to me

449
00:22:37,327 --> 00:22:40,727
that you expect the hasher
to be your personal concubine.

450
00:22:41,701 --> 00:22:42,735
Wait, what ?

451
00:22:44,508 --> 00:22:48,242
Well, despite what you may have
heard about my recent... lapse,

452
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:53,246
I'm not that kind of guy anymore, OK ?
I can't be your new hasher boy-toy.

453
00:22:54,612 --> 00:22:57,834
My God, you're such a riot.
You're like Dane Cook, but funny.

454
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,711
Sexual harassment
is no laughing matter.

455
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,422
I felt your yearning looks
as I leave a room,

456
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,507
the accidental physical contact.

457
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:05,552
Seriously ?

458
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:07,908
I need a secure job
to fund my project.

459
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:10,346
I can't afford to be your plaything

460
00:23:10,534 --> 00:23:13,962
and be tossed aside once you
inevitably desire a new

461
00:23:14,087 --> 00:23:15,268
carnal conquest.

462
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:17,753
You know, I'm sorry,
Ashleigh, I quit.

463
00:23:27,714 --> 00:23:29,888
You were sleeping.
Why aren't you working ?

464
00:23:30,321 --> 00:23:33,106
First of all, it's rude to speak
in that tone of voice

465
00:23:33,231 --> 00:23:34,746
to someone who just woke up.

466
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,812
Sorry, but we're on
a tight schedule here,

467
00:23:36,937 --> 00:23:39,208
a lot of people waiting for me
to finish this.

468
00:23:41,884 --> 00:23:43,972
I hate to break it
to you, but I don't actually

469
00:23:44,097 --> 00:23:46,132
think that's gonna
happen any time soon.

470
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,550
- What are you talking about ?
- I checked your work,

471
00:23:48,675 --> 00:23:50,846
and it looks like you're
heading for a dead end.

472
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,323
With the current formulation,
maybe we can push the wire

473
00:23:53,448 --> 00:23:55,141
to reconduct for 20 minutes,

474
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:58,478
half hour tops, but the decay
will accelerate and then it's dead.

475
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:01,439
No offense, but I don't think you
know what you're talking about.

476
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,272
I think I know as much as you do,

477
00:24:03,397 --> 00:24:06,081
and you might see that if you
weren't so cocky all the time.

478
00:24:06,206 --> 00:24:09,164
I am not being cocky.
I did win a major grant for this.

479
00:24:10,422 --> 00:24:13,159
OK, that sounded cocky,
but you just said my wire won't work.

480
00:24:13,347 --> 00:24:15,864
Not unless you plan to keep the
environmental temperature

481
00:24:15,989 --> 00:24:17,079
at absolute zero.

482
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:20,642
A patentable prototype at room
temperature ? Ch-yeah, right !

483
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,133
You're gonna have to
start out with a new formula.

484
00:24:23,258 --> 00:24:25,340
Now this doesn't have anything to do

485
00:24:25,709 --> 00:24:28,816
with you being mad at me for
forgetting your name at first, right ?

486
00:24:29,237 --> 00:24:30,494
What ? My God !

487
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:33,021
I was just asking.
That was out of line.

488
00:24:33,665 --> 00:24:36,265
But if this is about that,
I said I was sorry.

489
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:39,484
- I wanted to go out with you.
- I'm out of here.

490
00:24:41,054 --> 00:24:44,766
But if you can climb off your
ginormous ego for five minutes,

491
00:24:44,891 --> 00:24:47,816
which is about how long your
stupid wire's ever gonna last,

492
00:24:47,941 --> 00:24:49,487
you might wanna check my notes.

493
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,533
It's all in there
in black and white.

494
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:53,083
Later, dunderkind.

495
00:25:12,225 --> 00:25:13,975
Someone's in a good mood.

496
00:25:14,518 --> 00:25:16,998
Well, I think I might
have some pretty exciting news.

497
00:25:17,123 --> 00:25:19,379
Things have been getting
pretty exciting here, too.

498
00:25:19,504 --> 00:25:23,461
I think Earnhardt is gonna try and make
his move coming into this next turn.

499
00:25:23,751 --> 00:25:25,087
Yeah, it's a nail-biter.

500
00:25:25,212 --> 00:25:28,706
Listen, I had this idea for a voter
registration party at Dobler's.

501
00:25:28,831 --> 00:25:30,778
- Well, that is exciting.
- That's not it.

502
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,672
But, if it goes well and if this
congresswoman gets re-elected,

503
00:25:33,797 --> 00:25:36,122
I might have a shot at a job
in Washington in the fall.

504
00:25:36,247 --> 00:25:38,035
And not just making copies,

505
00:25:38,546 --> 00:25:41,080
but a real job
as a legislative aide.

506
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,800
Well, you know what they say.

507
00:25:43,925 --> 00:25:47,753
When life gives you legislatives,
make legislative aide.

508
00:25:49,004 --> 00:25:50,454
That's great, Case.

509
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,794
Anyway...

510
00:25:52,778 --> 00:25:55,144
that's really soon. So...

511
00:25:56,341 --> 00:25:58,264
Maybe, we should talk about...

512
00:25:58,733 --> 00:26:00,283
you know, the future.

513
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:05,699
And I was wondering
what you were thinking about you...

514
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,164
and me and...

515
00:26:09,176 --> 00:26:10,276
graduation ?

516
00:26:11,325 --> 00:26:12,984
So, what do you think ?

517
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:19,527
I like turtles.

518
00:26:21,696 --> 00:26:22,412
What ?

519
00:26:22,537 --> 00:26:24,601
Listen,
I know it may not seem like it,

520
00:26:24,726 --> 00:26:27,418
but I have given this a lot
of thought and I have a plan.

521
00:26:27,543 --> 00:26:29,545
You do ? That's great. What is it ?

522
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:33,057
We'll figure it out
when the time comes.

523
00:26:33,247 --> 00:26:34,341
That's your plan ?

524
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,730
That's not a plan.
That is a plan to make a plan.

525
00:26:36,855 --> 00:26:39,263
- Which is a plan, no ?
- You don't even have a major.

526
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,596
I don't see the need
to hash out all the details

527
00:26:41,721 --> 00:26:43,434
before it's absolutely necessary.

528
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:47,209
If you'll excuse me, I think Earnhardt
blew out a left rear claw.

529
00:26:47,334 --> 00:26:49,315
I need to get him into the pit crew.

530
00:27:02,483 --> 00:27:03,978
Ash said to give you this.

531
00:27:04,103 --> 00:27:06,681
Dale's last, and only, hasher check.

532
00:27:06,806 --> 00:27:09,751
- Why couldn't he come himself ?
- He said he wanted to, quote,

533
00:27:09,876 --> 00:27:12,576
"avoid even the appearance
of impropriety,"

534
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,165
whatever that means.

535
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:17,091
I don't know if you heard,

536
00:27:17,216 --> 00:27:20,762
but I am throwing this voter
registration party at Dobler's tonight.

537
00:27:20,887 --> 00:27:22,415
- You should come.
- I can't.

538
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,873
I'm being interviewed by EW tonight.

539
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:27,136
Engineering Weekly.

540
00:27:27,525 --> 00:27:28,552
Yeah, got it.

541
00:27:28,677 --> 00:27:31,607
But that's a really big deal, right ?
You should be proud.

542
00:27:33,631 --> 00:27:36,231
Yeah, sure.
Here, let's sit for a second.

543
00:27:36,891 --> 00:27:38,078
It's just...

544
00:27:38,203 --> 00:27:39,949
I have this assistant

545
00:27:40,074 --> 00:27:43,077
who thinks I'm heading down
a blind alley with my wire,

546
00:27:43,202 --> 00:27:45,328
so I'm not feeling all
that proud right now.

547
00:27:46,692 --> 00:27:48,856
But this party of
yours sounds impressive.

548
00:27:48,981 --> 00:27:51,259
Yeah, I'm hoping
it'll get me a job in DC,

549
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:53,785
but it's causing this weirdness
between me and Cappie,

550
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:56,052
and I don't know
if it's even worth it

551
00:27:56,177 --> 00:27:58,766
because Rebecca says everyone
in Washington is a slimeball.

552
00:27:58,891 --> 00:28:01,941
- Why are you listening to Rebecca ?
- Good point.

553
00:28:02,154 --> 00:28:03,514
But what about Cappie ?

554
00:28:03,703 --> 00:28:06,017
Maybe Cappie will surprise you.

555
00:28:06,461 --> 00:28:07,261
Maybe.

556
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,547
And maybe you should be more excited
about this interview.

557
00:28:10,672 --> 00:28:12,648
You've worked hard. Enjoy it.

558
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:13,666
I know.

559
00:28:14,755 --> 00:28:15,805
Look at us.

560
00:28:16,691 --> 00:28:18,710
The Cartwrights are kicking ass.

561
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:20,322
Yes, we are.

562
00:28:27,574 --> 00:28:30,824
So, who's the hottie I saw you
talking to downstairs ?

563
00:28:31,171 --> 00:28:33,002
That would be Hunter,
our new hasher.

564
00:28:33,495 --> 00:28:34,945
His name's Hunter ?

565
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,837
Seriously ?
What happened to Bible Boy ?

566
00:28:37,962 --> 00:28:40,342
He didn't want to be
my sexual plaything.

567
00:28:40,532 --> 00:28:42,432
Has it really come to that ?

568
00:28:42,603 --> 00:28:45,669
So Hunter's all yours.
You can kiss him, jump on him,

569
00:28:45,794 --> 00:28:47,706
roll him in bread crumbs
for all I care,

570
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:50,318
because I am done with
the whole Fisher thing.

571
00:28:51,227 --> 00:28:54,079
That new hasher has got to go.

572
00:28:54,563 --> 00:28:56,192
You're kidding, right ?

573
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,778
He is smoking hot. I thought
that's what everybody wanted.

574
00:28:58,966 --> 00:29:01,720
We thought so, too,
but we get a bad feeling about him.

575
00:29:02,098 --> 00:29:04,158
- He seems kinda pervy.
- We want Dale back.

576
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,267
He's weird and judgey
but we trust him.

577
00:29:06,392 --> 00:29:08,871
Well, I can't get Dale back.
He quit.

578
00:29:09,386 --> 00:29:13,245
I brought you ladies some towels
in case you want to take a shower later.

579
00:29:15,235 --> 00:29:16,235
Thank you.

580
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,040
I'll call Dale.

581
00:29:35,321 --> 00:29:36,171
Well...

582
00:29:37,226 --> 00:29:39,941
I'm impressed.
You actually made registering to vote

583
00:29:40,066 --> 00:29:42,571
not seem like a total
boring waste of time.

584
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:45,167
I hope Joel feels
the same way, mostly.

585
00:29:45,292 --> 00:29:48,300
- Have you seen him yet ?
- No, but here's your boyfriend.

586
00:29:50,386 --> 00:29:52,230
- Hey.
- Can I get you a drink ?

587
00:29:52,355 --> 00:29:54,978
I can't. Working.
I would love a water.

588
00:29:55,103 --> 00:29:56,403
Water. OK, sure.

589
00:29:59,011 --> 00:30:01,011
That was awkward.
What's up ?

590
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,591
- Are we really going to do this ?
- Yeah.

591
00:30:03,716 --> 00:30:07,253
Fine. I told him about Washington
and then...

592
00:30:07,929 --> 00:30:09,854
that we should
talk about graduation.

593
00:30:10,078 --> 00:30:12,578
- What did he say ?
- "I like turtles".

594
00:30:12,821 --> 00:30:13,671
Well...

595
00:30:15,044 --> 00:30:16,714
what'd you expect ?

596
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:17,989
That's our...

597
00:30:18,845 --> 00:30:19,900
your Cappie.

598
00:30:24,645 --> 00:30:26,907
Great turnout, Casey. I'm impressed.

599
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,031
Thanks, Joel.

600
00:30:28,156 --> 00:30:30,744
With these demos, we can really
address a solid voting block.

601
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,012
Yawn. Wonk talk. That's my cue.

602
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:41,216
This place is packed.
Casey must be really happy.

603
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:43,366
She would be,
but she tried to talk to Cappie

604
00:30:43,491 --> 00:30:46,278
about working in Washington
after graduation,

605
00:30:46,403 --> 00:30:48,953
and he just wants
to talk about turtles.

606
00:30:51,035 --> 00:30:51,863
Of course.

607
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:01,373
I knew you'd find a way to blow it.

608
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:04,257
You know, talking to yourself
is a sign of insanity.

609
00:31:04,382 --> 00:31:07,476
It's turning like I said.
Casey's gonna leave you after graduation

610
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:10,181
and what will you have left here ?
Turtles.

611
00:31:11,723 --> 00:31:12,823
Here you go.

612
00:31:14,077 --> 00:31:17,540
It's going really, really well.
Actually, I was thinking about,

613
00:31:17,665 --> 00:31:20,640
doing a bunch of these at college
campuses all over the district.

614
00:31:20,765 --> 00:31:23,672
That sounds interesting.
I'd like to talk more about that.

615
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,176
Why don't you come back
to my apartment later for a debriefing.

616
00:31:30,882 --> 00:31:33,682
Casey, if you want to
talk about Washington

617
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,349
- we should talk about Washington.
- It's OK.

618
00:31:36,474 --> 00:31:39,146
I don't think
it's going to be an issue.

619
00:31:42,948 --> 00:31:45,927
So, on behalf of ZBZ,
I'd like you to know

620
00:31:46,052 --> 00:31:48,729
that we would really...
You want to close the front door ?

621
00:31:48,854 --> 00:31:51,075
No, I prefer to leave it open,
if you don't mind.

622
00:31:51,565 --> 00:31:52,365
Great.

623
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:55,704
Anyway, I would really like it
if you would consider coming back.

624
00:31:56,219 --> 00:31:58,082
Are you asking for
the house or for you ?

625
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,262
For the house.

626
00:31:59,387 --> 00:32:01,710
Definitely the house.
We need you, Dale.

627
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,964
And not some flashy hunkazoid
in a cashmere V-neck.

628
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:08,801
If you were a chip, you would be
the crunchy kind in a plain, honest bag.

629
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,929
I'm saying, I like your package.

630
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:20,410
Obviously, there would
have to be some ground rules.

631
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,982
You'd have to take
a sexual harassment seminar

632
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,691
and agree to sign a contract

633
00:32:24,816 --> 00:32:27,361
swearing not to make
any unwanted advances.

634
00:32:28,704 --> 00:32:30,030
I will do that.

635
00:32:30,575 --> 00:32:33,765
So, are we good ?
You'll come back and be our hasher ?

636
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,870
Let me sleep on it.

637
00:32:38,143 --> 00:32:38,943
Alone.

638
00:32:45,366 --> 00:32:47,816
This must be our young Einstein now.

639
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,342
Cartwright, this is David Fanning
from Engineering Weekly.

640
00:32:52,232 --> 00:32:54,470
Can't wait to hear all about this wire
of yours

641
00:32:54,595 --> 00:32:56,745
that's going to change the world.

642
00:32:57,137 --> 00:33:00,769
- Can we go off the record ?
- We haven't gone on the record yet.

643
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,337
What are you doing ?

644
00:33:02,462 --> 00:33:05,172
Dana thinks we may have found
a problem with our new formula.

645
00:33:05,297 --> 00:33:07,584
That's interesting and something
we should talk about

646
00:33:07,709 --> 00:33:10,908
after we're interviewed
by a national science publication.

647
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:12,865
- Back on the record.
- Off the record.

648
00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:17,251
She thinks we're heading for a dead end,
which means a patentable prototype

649
00:33:17,376 --> 00:33:19,955
might not be possible
for years, if at all.

650
00:33:20,143 --> 00:33:22,207
That's ridiculous.
Back on the record.

651
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:23,626
Off the record.

652
00:33:24,666 --> 00:33:26,003
I think she may be right.

653
00:33:26,191 --> 00:33:28,797
We should cancel this interview,
tell the dean.

654
00:33:28,985 --> 00:33:30,271
Are you insane ?

655
00:33:30,396 --> 00:33:33,510
Opportunities for recognition like this
come around once in a lifetime,

656
00:33:33,698 --> 00:33:35,271
twice only if you're very lucky.

657
00:33:35,396 --> 00:33:37,264
I'm not about to let this one
pass me by.

658
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,487
I don't understand.
Am I supposed to pretend

659
00:33:39,612 --> 00:33:42,279
that everything is OK,
so you can get back at your ex-partner

660
00:33:42,404 --> 00:33:45,707
- who screwed you over 20 years ago ?
- So you do understand.

661
00:33:45,832 --> 00:33:47,983
Sorry. The brilliant ones
are always a little off.

662
00:33:48,357 --> 00:33:51,476
- It's not easy being the wunderkind.
- Please stop calling me that.

663
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,510
Look...

664
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:57,105
I got this wire to self-heal,

665
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:59,425
turn on a light bulb
for five minutes.

666
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,246
So far that's all it does.

667
00:34:01,434 --> 00:34:03,457
Maybe one day
it will change the world

668
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:06,306
and I really hope I'm the one
to do that, but right now,

669
00:34:06,431 --> 00:34:08,746
it just has potential.

670
00:34:09,765 --> 00:34:11,830
Potential, like me, I hope.

671
00:34:12,196 --> 00:34:14,464
So if you don't mind,
I'd rather not do this

672
00:34:14,589 --> 00:34:16,220
because I don't feel like a genius,

673
00:34:16,408 --> 00:34:19,348
I'm not a wunderkind,
I'm not a wunder-anything.

674
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:22,434
And in case there's any way
you didn't know, that's not his hair.

675
00:34:25,733 --> 00:34:27,856
Is that on or off the record ?

676
00:34:30,343 --> 00:34:31,143
Right.

677
00:34:32,818 --> 00:34:35,073
I've been thinking about
what you'll owe me.

678
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,490
If you become president,

679
00:34:36,615 --> 00:34:39,284
I want ambassadorship to France
or a battleship.

680
00:34:39,617 --> 00:34:41,954
You might have been right
about politics being scummy.

681
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:43,747
I think Joel hit on me.

682
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,707
He asked me to his place
for a "debriefing."

683
00:34:48,301 --> 00:34:49,545
That was my dad's line.

684
00:34:50,307 --> 00:34:53,465
I didn't think Joel was like that.
Why are all guys so disappointing ?

685
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,676
Damn it, I really wanted that job.

686
00:34:56,702 --> 00:34:58,470
Well, if you really want the job...

687
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,619
No. I'm going to get to Washington

688
00:35:00,744 --> 00:35:02,683
but I'll be damned
if I get there that way.

689
00:35:03,044 --> 00:35:05,832
Shouldn't you be telling
that to the slimeball ?

690
00:35:05,957 --> 00:35:07,107
You're right.

691
00:35:11,341 --> 00:35:12,859
Let me tell you something.

692
00:35:13,048 --> 00:35:15,446
Slimeballs like you are the reason
why politics suck.

693
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:17,495
Everybody's in it for what they can get.


694
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,908
You're not getting me.
I am not having sex with you.

695
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:23,245
So are we all still going back
to your apartment for the debriefing ?

696
00:35:25,104 --> 00:35:27,499
Wait, you're going back
to his apartment, too ?

697
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:28,767
All of you ?

698
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:33,839
Please say you're planning
some really weird orgy.

699
00:35:38,935 --> 00:35:40,411
Maybe he thought it was funny.

700
00:35:40,536 --> 00:35:42,306
I'm sure he thought
it was hysterical.

701
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,225
- I blame you.
- What did I do ?

702
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:48,729
You're the one who put it in my head
that everyone in politics's a slimeball.

703
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:51,433
- I didn't tell you to call him one.
- Yes, you did.

704
00:35:51,558 --> 00:35:54,270
Thought you guys
might like a healthy snack,

705
00:35:54,395 --> 00:35:56,694
so I threw together a crudite,

706
00:35:56,883 --> 00:35:58,701
beef sticks and Cheesaritos
for Cappie.

707
00:35:58,826 --> 00:36:00,026
Thanks, Daley.

708
00:36:01,236 --> 00:36:02,586
Great, he's back.

709
00:36:06,195 --> 00:36:08,295
I really thought I had that job.

710
00:36:09,187 --> 00:36:12,237
- Clearly, I don't belong there.
- You know what ?

711
00:36:13,961 --> 00:36:15,214
Yes, you do.

712
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:17,758
- What am I supposed to do now ?
- I'll tell you.

713
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:20,800
You're gonna go talk to that guy
and you're gonna get that job back.

714
00:36:20,925 --> 00:36:22,429
I can't, I am too humiliated.

715
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:25,682
You're Casey Cartwright.
You can do anything you want.

716
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:29,803
That's how I know you're gonna go to
Washington and you're gonna be amazing.

717
00:36:29,928 --> 00:36:32,378
Even if I could, what about us ?

718
00:36:32,687 --> 00:36:34,742
- What about...
- Graduation ?

719
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,485
My God, he said it.

720
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,278
You'll never leave here.

721
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,781
- You love it too much.
- That's true, I do love it here.

722
00:36:41,118 --> 00:36:43,867
But I don't think I could be anywhere
that didn't have you.

723
00:36:48,513 --> 00:36:49,623
We'll be fine.

724
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,568
Go get that job.

725
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:54,545
I'd kiss you for luck
but I've got beef stick breath.

726
00:37:10,753 --> 00:37:12,353
You wanted to see me ?

727
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:26,279
That was quite a little stunt
you pulled.

728
00:37:26,804 --> 00:37:30,038
When the dean heard about it,
he wanted to have us both expelled...

729
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,540
from the country !

730
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:34,334
Fortunately, I reminded him
that I have tenure

731
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,671
and that you're the Gary Wyatt
Grant winner, so we're both safe.

732
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,922
For now.

733
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:41,262
Thanks.

734
00:37:41,387 --> 00:37:44,595
I realize that my first impression
was right about you.

735
00:37:44,783 --> 00:37:47,556
- What was that ?
- That you lack drive, ambition.

736
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,349
It isn't just about the science.

737
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,463
You're never gonna get anywhere
with that "aww, shucks" attitude.

738
00:37:52,588 --> 00:37:56,038
Nobody's gonna toot your horn
if you can't do it yourself.

739
00:37:56,163 --> 00:37:57,482
Maybe you're right.

740
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,693
I just couldn't pretend
I deserve it.

741
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:02,279
I hope I'll get another chance
when the time is right.

742
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,698
But if I don't,
I'm not gonna let it rule my life.

743
00:38:20,511 --> 00:38:23,592
Try reversing the polarity
on the capacitors.

744
00:38:24,891 --> 00:38:25,886
Excuse me ?

745
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:40,275
I want you to know how sorry I am
about the misunderstanding last night.

746
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:43,616
If there's any way you could forget
that it happened, that'd be great.

747
00:38:43,741 --> 00:38:45,553
And I hope you'll still consider me

748
00:38:45,678 --> 00:38:47,950
for a legislative aide job
in Washington,

749
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:49,776
because I would be great at it.

750
00:38:49,901 --> 00:38:52,893
But I am sorry.
I already said that, but I am sorry.

751
00:38:53,018 --> 00:38:56,500
First off... there's no need
to apologize.

752
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,125
I should have been clearer.

753
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:02,765
And I think there may have been
another misunderstanding.

754
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:05,926
You were never gonna be considered
for a legislative aide job.

755
00:39:06,557 --> 00:39:09,607
You're an incredibly smart
and resourceful person

756
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:12,516
and someday you're gonna do great
in Washington.

757
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:15,810
But we mostly hire people with
postgraduate degrees for those jobs.

758
00:39:15,935 --> 00:39:18,688
With a bachelor's degree
you could maybe cover the phones

759
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:22,567
- or answer constituent correspondence.
- But I want to do more.

760
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:25,696
Then you're gonna need more experience
or more education,

761
00:39:26,475 --> 00:39:28,275
maybe in local government.

762
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:31,201
Have you thought about graduate school ?
What about law school ?

763
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,328
I thought about law school
but it was kind of for a boyfriend.

764
00:39:34,835 --> 00:39:37,290
Well, maybe you should really
consider it for yourself.

765
00:39:38,469 --> 00:39:39,319
I will.

766
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:40,920
Thanks.

767
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:44,673
I still know some people
in law school here.

768
00:39:45,021 --> 00:39:47,718
Deadlines are coming up,
so if you decide to apply

769
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:51,327
and want some help...
and that is not a come-on,

770
00:39:51,452 --> 00:39:52,556
by the way.

771
00:39:53,325 --> 00:39:54,765
Thanks. I'd welcome that.

772
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,435
The help, not the come-on.

773
00:40:07,286 --> 00:40:08,155
So...

774
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:11,193
- You really botched it with the dean ?
- You heard about that ?

775
00:40:11,318 --> 00:40:13,718
Nerd Twitter's
all atwitter about it.

776
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:18,038
So I guess now the pressure's off,
you don't need me anymore ?

777
00:40:18,163 --> 00:40:21,960
Actually, I'd really like you to stay.
I mean, if you want.

778
00:40:22,451 --> 00:40:25,589
I read your notes.
You were right about the dead end.

779
00:40:26,116 --> 00:40:28,610
And if I'm going to have to work up
a new formula,

780
00:40:28,735 --> 00:40:30,408
I could really use your help.

781
00:40:30,533 --> 00:40:32,888
Maybe you're not as big of a jerk
as I thought you were.

782
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:35,137
- Thanks.
- I said "maybe."

783
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,977
So where do we start ?

784
00:40:39,376 --> 00:40:42,647
Professor Hastings thinks
we should try reversing the polarity

785
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:45,192
- on the capacitors.
- He's probably right.

786
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,111
Hand me that cooling fan.

787
00:41:03,472 --> 00:41:04,495
It's over ?

788
00:41:05,652 --> 00:41:07,552
I can't believe I missed
the turtle race.

789
00:41:07,677 --> 00:41:08,774
Relax, Spitter.

790
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:10,926
I believe there's still a straggler
or two.

791
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:15,180
How did your interview go ?
When is the magazine coming out ?

792
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:17,066
That's not gonna happen, not yet.

793
00:41:17,191 --> 00:41:20,184
I decided that when it does happen,
I want it to be the right way.

794
00:41:21,114 --> 00:41:24,981
Well, I've made a decision, too.
I'm gonna go to law school.

795
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,274
That's great, Case.

796
00:41:27,188 --> 00:41:29,888
And I've made a pretty
big decision myself.

797
00:41:31,242 --> 00:41:32,239
Check this out.

798
00:41:34,078 --> 00:41:36,118
This is a form
for declaring a major.

799
00:41:37,521 --> 00:41:40,309
My God, you declared a major ?

800
00:41:40,434 --> 00:41:41,684
That's amazing.

801
00:41:42,624 --> 00:41:45,274
- Wait, this is blank.
- Well, baby steps.

802
00:41:46,135 --> 00:41:48,935
You know what they say
about slow and steady.

803
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:58,112
It's down to the wire !
No telling how this one will end.

804
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,211
And...

805
00:41:59,336 --> 00:42:01,686
Earnhardt takes the checkered flag !
