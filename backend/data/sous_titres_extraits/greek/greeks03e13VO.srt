1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,249
Previously.

2
00:00:01,419 --> 00:00:04,685
I know who started the fire.
I did. But it was an accident.

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:08,185
- Maybe someday you'll forgive me.
- For burning down my house?

4
00:00:08,468 --> 00:00:11,870
I'm gonna go before my Benz turns into
a pumpkin. Later, Sorry to leave you

5
00:00:11,995 --> 00:00:14,485
hanging like that.
Maybe I can make it up to you?

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,675
- Like a date?
- Yeah, like a date!

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,767
- What are they doing?
- Dancing.

8
00:00:18,972 --> 00:00:20,916
- What's that?
- I think it's a joke.

9
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:24,423
- I don't think it's funny.
- It's not a joke, we will handle it.

10
00:00:29,982 --> 00:00:32,233
Look who's home!

11
00:00:32,358 --> 00:00:34,699
How many nights in a row can
you spend somewhere else

12
00:00:34,954 --> 00:00:36,811
before you start
calling that place home?

13
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:39,170
Cappie can't stay here
I'm kind of stuck commuting.

14
00:00:39,295 --> 00:00:41,165
I just miss our pre-sleep
gossip sessions.

15
00:00:41,427 --> 00:00:43,438
Last night, I took my laptop
to bed and fell asleep

16
00:00:43,563 --> 00:00:46,174
reviewing my old status
updates and TMZ videos.

17
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:49,006
But isn't it nice having
this whole room to yourself?

18
00:00:49,235 --> 00:00:51,679
It's officially the biggest
single in the house,

19
00:00:51,804 --> 00:00:54,249
or in any sorority house
in the world.

20
00:00:54,374 --> 00:00:56,289
I just miss you!

21
00:00:58,514 --> 00:01:00,351
What? What's wrong?

22
00:01:00,613 --> 00:01:03,157
- You kind of reek.
- I reek? Of what?

23
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:08,067
Stale beer and pepperoni.
And... feet.

24
00:01:10,423 --> 00:01:13,034
I smell like the KT house?
I can't even tell.

25
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:16,037
- I guess it grows on you.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

26
00:01:16,162 --> 00:01:17,872
So you didn't shower there?

27
00:01:17,997 --> 00:01:22,001
No, not when the shower gets dubbed
"the Vomitorium" during parties.

28
00:01:26,452 --> 00:01:28,451
- Was a boy here?
- The All-Greek

29
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:32,097
- Softball Tournament is this weekend.
- Of course! How could I forget?

30
00:01:32,222 --> 00:01:35,890
- It's worth five Blue Ribbon points.
- ????

31
00:01:36,015 --> 00:01:39,180
It's a good chance for me to
meet a hot baseball-boy of my own.

32
00:01:39,352 --> 00:01:41,553
You're ready to jump back
on the dating horse again?

33
00:01:41,678 --> 00:01:44,620
I'm ready to ride that horse
like a bucking bronco.

34
00:01:44,745 --> 00:01:48,503
- Awkward.
- Yeah, you might be all settled down.

35
00:01:48,628 --> 00:01:52,193
Smelly, but I'm ready
to meet a fun new guy.

36
00:01:55,935 --> 00:01:59,409
- Nice shirt.
- Thanks, the pledges made it for me.

37
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:02,283
I think they're starting to
respect me as a Pledge Educator.

38
00:02:02,408 --> 00:02:04,686
You think they misspelled it
on purpose, to be funny?

39
00:02:04,811 --> 00:02:07,255
- Like, school with a 'k'?
- I decided not to ask.

40
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,211
- What's up, Rusty?
- What'd you call me, pledge?

41
00:02:10,383 --> 00:02:12,260
Or wait, is it Randy?

42
00:02:12,385 --> 00:02:15,494
It's Rusty. But you should
call me by my KT name

43
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:19,623
which is Spitter. Or Mr. Spitter.
Where's your pledge pin, pledge?

44
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:21,890
It's supposed to be on
your shirt at all times.

45
00:02:22,015 --> 00:02:25,513
- It's in my backpack.
- Put it on.

46
00:02:25,638 --> 00:02:27,937
That's a funny shirt you guys made.

47
00:02:28,778 --> 00:02:32,180
- What's so funny about it?
- Now? Nothing.

48
00:02:32,305 --> 00:02:34,916
Bye, Dumptruck.

49
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:38,353
So how are things with you and Grant
since you guys came out as a couple?

50
00:02:38,478 --> 00:02:42,482
The house has really been supportive
Except for the whole tiara incident.

51
00:02:43,649 --> 00:02:45,622
The tiara what?
Can I get a small coffee?

52
00:02:45,818 --> 00:02:49,097
Someone left a couple of tiaras
on our door after the Fairy Tale Ball.

53
00:02:49,222 --> 00:02:52,290
But it's no big deal. You know how it is
guys are always making fun of each other.

54
00:02:52,415 --> 00:02:55,341
Guys make fun of me all
the time. And some girls.

55
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:58,009
I feel like I've barely
seen you since I've been dating Grant.

56
00:02:58,264 --> 00:03:00,908
You'd like him.
He's actually a great guy.

57
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:03,391
Spend some time with him
and you'd see what I mean.

58
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,414
Maybe the three of us
could hang out tonight?

59
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:10,543
- Yeah. That sounds like fun.
- What sounds like fun?

60
00:03:10,977 --> 00:03:14,055
I was just talking about the
three of us hanging out tonight.

61
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,030
- The three of us? Fun.
- Yeah. It's gonna be really fun.

62
00:03:22,141 --> 00:03:24,014
-= 313 =-
"Take Me Out"

63
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,993
Kappa Team

64
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:36,244
Tell me again, why are
you crop-dusting my room

65
00:03:36,369 --> 00:03:40,373
- with lemon-scented cancer chemicals?
- Ash is trying to meet a new guy

66
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,730
and she's worried
about second-hand smell.

67
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,184
God! What is this?

68
00:03:50,973 --> 00:03:54,962
It's either a relatively
recent tuna fish sandwich

69
00:03:55,087 --> 00:03:58,054
or a really old ham and shrimp one.

70
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,072
So, Ash is in the market
for a new guy?

71
00:04:04,197 --> 00:04:07,663
Yeah, I was thinking of setting her up
with this Lambda Sig on IFC.

72
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:11,503
He's crazy hot. I mean,

73
00:04:11,628 --> 00:04:14,586
temperature-wise.
He sweats.

74
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:17,382
Or what about a nice KT?

75
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,288
Then she could acclimate to the smell
by being around the house more.

76
00:04:20,413 --> 00:04:23,591
I don't know.
Ash has a really sensitive nose.

77
00:04:23,716 --> 00:04:27,720
Come on. What about Beaver?
He's just like a big puppy dog,

78
00:04:29,255 --> 00:04:32,688
who doesn't know how to fetch,
but he's housebroken. Mostly.

79
00:04:33,218 --> 00:04:36,324
Right. I doubt Ash
will click with a guy

80
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:40,445
who got a mild concussion from attempting
to parachute off the roof with a bed sheet.

81
00:04:40,633 --> 00:04:43,856
- Every guy tries when they're young.
- It was last semester.

82
00:04:43,981 --> 00:04:47,973
But he's matured a lot over the break.
Come on, it's perfect.

83
00:04:48,642 --> 00:04:51,073
They're both tall.

84
00:04:51,677 --> 00:04:55,669
OK, he's really nice, and cute...

85
00:04:55,882 --> 00:04:59,117
- Super cute.
- I guess it won't hurt to try, right?

86
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:04,761
Seriously, you don't smell this?

87
00:05:04,886 --> 00:05:07,340
No. What's wrong with this?

88
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,828
It's just ripe.

89
00:05:09,953 --> 00:05:12,933
- What?
- Gosh...

90
00:05:14,634 --> 00:05:18,202
Then the miracle
of Vesuvius happened,

91
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:21,487
as the cups were drained

92
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,418
and beer rained down upon them

93
00:05:24,543 --> 00:05:28,436
like tears of joy
from the heavens above.

94
00:05:28,981 --> 00:05:31,058
OK, that's it for today's lesson.

95
00:05:31,183 --> 00:05:33,928
But before we wrap up here,
I'd like to reiterate

96
00:05:34,053 --> 00:05:37,598
the importance of wearing
your pledge pins at all times.

97
00:05:37,723 --> 00:05:41,569
It is a constant reminder
that first and foremost,

98
00:05:41,694 --> 00:05:45,020
you are Kts through and through.

99
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:48,055
And I've caught
some of you slacking lately.

100
00:05:48,301 --> 00:05:51,345
Yeah, I kinda lost mine.
You have any extras?

101
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,986
- I saw you wearing it 2 hours ago.
- You're the one who told me to take it

102
00:05:55,111 --> 00:05:57,337
out of my backpack where
I knew I wouldn't lose it.

103
00:05:57,947 --> 00:06:01,109
- Yeah, Anthony Hopkins?
- I lost mine, too.

104
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,826
But actually, it was the temporary one.
I lost my first one last semester.

105
00:06:04,951 --> 00:06:07,939
The temporary one
was my pledge pin! It's gone?

106
00:06:08,064 --> 00:06:11,732
It's somewhere in the house
or on campus.

107
00:06:11,857 --> 00:06:15,861
I'll just order a few replacement pins.
Does anyone else need one while I'm at it?

108
00:06:16,996 --> 00:06:21,000
I still have mine but I know I'm a KT
pledge. Do I need a pin to remind me?

109
00:06:21,292 --> 00:06:24,935
Yes, you do, OK?
It's a KT tradition.

110
00:06:25,771 --> 00:06:27,915
- It's a rule.
- But wee Kts, man.

111
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,388
We're not supposed
to follow the rules, right?

112
00:06:30,576 --> 00:06:34,121
OK, fine. Just wear them
around the house, at the very least.

113
00:06:34,246 --> 00:06:37,425
And try not to lose them.
Meeting adjourned.

114
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,429
That's so cute.
Rusty's acting like a man.

115
00:06:41,554 --> 00:06:45,278
It's not easy being a hard-ass when
your older sister is emasculating you.

116
00:06:48,623 --> 00:06:51,576
I will see you after class.
Bye, Rus.

117
00:06:51,701 --> 00:06:54,790
Cap, I have a question for you.

118
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,416
When Casey was with Max,
I know you didn't like him.

119
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,793
- That's correct.
- No. That's not the question.

120
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:02,984
That was too easy.
Hit me with something harder.

121
00:07:03,109 --> 00:07:05,219
I have this problem.

122
00:07:05,344 --> 00:07:09,010
Calvin wants me to spend time with
his new boyfriend who I cannot stand.

123
00:07:09,181 --> 00:07:13,160
Fortunately, that's an easy one, too. Do
what everyone does in that situation.

124
00:07:13,285 --> 00:07:16,097
Simply pretend you like
each other in front of Calvin.

125
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,228
What if I can't pretend?
'Cause I really don't like him.

126
00:07:19,617 --> 00:07:23,143
You don't have to like him,
you just have to tolerate him.

127
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:34,243
You guys are going out tonight ?

128
00:07:34,368 --> 00:07:36,779
- Yep. You ?
- Yeah, big date.

129
00:07:37,376 --> 00:07:38,626
How do I look ?

130
00:07:39,287 --> 00:07:42,753
If you're gonna ask us how your butt
looks in those jeans, don't.

131
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,602
- Who's the lucky girl ?
- Rebecca.

132
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:48,251
- Really ?
- Yeah.

133
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:51,332
- You asked out Rebecca Logan ?
- Actually, she asked me.

134
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:55,140
- If she pays do you have to put out ?
- Only if I order steak.

135
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,478
- What are you guys doing ?
- He's making me hang out with Rusty.

136
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:01,742
- He's my friend.
- He's a KT.

137
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:03,310
And he can't stand me.

138
00:08:03,435 --> 00:08:05,275
What, you hit him
with a pledge paddle ?

139
00:08:05,705 --> 00:08:08,069
No, but we duct-taped him
to a wall last year

140
00:08:08,549 --> 00:08:12,365
and then I accidentally got
his girlfriend to move away.

141
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:14,661
You got his girlfriend
to move away ?

142
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,161
Do not high-five him.

143
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,946
All right, guys.
Do I look fat in these jeans ?

144
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,052
Do you realize how many
sweaty heads have worn this ?

145
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:34,509
You can put this inside.

146
00:08:34,634 --> 00:08:37,224
I haven't blown my nose in it
and I washed it last week.

147
00:08:37,662 --> 00:08:38,512
Thanks.

148
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,769
I think I'll risk it
with the helmet.

149
00:08:43,368 --> 00:08:44,568
Let's go, Ash.

150
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,133
Here we go.

151
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:57,161
That was supposed to be a slow-pitch.
That was way faster than slow.

152
00:09:01,727 --> 00:09:03,708
Ash, that was... so close.

153
00:09:04,268 --> 00:09:06,268
Close to what ? Decapitation ?

154
00:09:09,134 --> 00:09:09,965
All right.

155
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:11,300
Here we go.

156
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,681
Let me...

157
00:09:17,944 --> 00:09:20,684
I'm gonna show you
the proper way to handle a bat.

158
00:09:22,146 --> 00:09:22,896
Okay.

159
00:09:23,778 --> 00:09:25,230
Personal space, Beaver.

160
00:09:25,624 --> 00:09:27,982
I really hope that was
a roll of tokens in your pocket.

161
00:09:28,154 --> 00:09:30,569
Gosh, just trying
to help with your swing.

162
00:09:32,465 --> 00:09:34,068
First : Stop winking at Cappie.

163
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:37,004
And second : That was the most cliché,
sleazy date-movie move,

164
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:39,327
- and you know it.
- I didn't know, I swear.

165
00:09:39,498 --> 00:09:42,496
- You don't think that was sleazy ?
- I don't know what "cliché" means.

166
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,479
Guys, we need to help
each other before the game,

167
00:09:45,604 --> 00:09:47,585
work with each other
during the game,

168
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:50,339
and shower with each other
after the game.

169
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:51,672
OK, all right.

170
00:09:51,844 --> 00:09:54,800
Seriously, what do you think
about KT and ZBZ pairing up ?

171
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:00,640
Ash, what do you think ?
Sounds good to me.

172
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:02,663
Maybe...

173
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,061
We have to go to the bathroom.

174
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:08,774
- I don't need to go to the bathroom.
- I think she meant me.

175
00:10:09,556 --> 00:10:10,499
Let's go.

176
00:10:18,064 --> 00:10:20,047
Those don't look like ginger ales.

177
00:10:20,172 --> 00:10:21,151
Pale ales.

178
00:10:21,276 --> 00:10:24,026
I figured these
could help ease the tension.

179
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:26,281
Thank you, Grant.

180
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,752
Just don't sell me out
if you get carded.

181
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:32,921
But if you're looking for payback
for me duct-taping you to the wall,

182
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:36,284
- I guess here's your chance.
- I just remembered...

183
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:37,761
I'm underage.

184
00:10:41,783 --> 00:10:45,393
But it's not like
I haven't had one before.

185
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:47,854
Forget about the
duct-taping-me-to-the-wall thing.

186
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,911
It's in the past.
It was some stupid prank.

187
00:10:51,036 --> 00:10:54,036
Like those tiaras
someone left outside your door.

188
00:10:55,211 --> 00:10:57,822
Yes, which is also in the past.

189
00:10:58,143 --> 00:11:00,449
Not really.
We don't know who did it.

190
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,189
- And we don't care.
- I do.

191
00:11:02,314 --> 00:11:04,621
- And I think you should, too.
- It's not a big deal.

192
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,653
It seems pretty harmless.

193
00:11:07,615 --> 00:11:09,269
- It didn't happen to you.
- Nope.

194
00:11:09,394 --> 00:11:11,420
But I was duct-taped to a wall.

195
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:14,380
- I thought that was in the past.
- Like the tiaras.

196
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,513
Boy, this sure is fun.

197
00:11:29,577 --> 00:11:31,942
You really thought Beaver
would be a good match for me ?

198
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,320
- Well, you're both tall.
- Yeah, sure.

199
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:37,612
We're both tall and he's cute
and he's got big, manly biceps,

200
00:11:38,107 --> 00:11:40,817
- but he's just so...
- Sweet ?

201
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:43,334
...mentally challenged.
No offense.

202
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:45,621
I appreciate the thought.

203
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,873
But I just don't think KTs
are my type.

204
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:51,878
You two.

205
00:11:52,138 --> 00:11:54,129
We'd love to have ZBZ
over for a housewarming

206
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,144
when our new place is finished.

207
00:11:56,269 --> 00:11:58,342
But you already warmed our house
to the ground.

208
00:11:58,948 --> 00:12:01,448
Let it go, Natalie.
What's done is done.

209
00:12:01,573 --> 00:12:03,567
Thanks, Katherine,
we really appreciate it.

210
00:12:03,692 --> 00:12:06,656
Of course, ZBZ is still not invited.
On principle alone.

211
00:12:07,675 --> 00:12:10,231
I saw you guys
rehearsing with some KTs.

212
00:12:10,572 --> 00:12:13,450
- Your partner, perhaps ?
- It's nice to know

213
00:12:13,575 --> 00:12:16,276
some houses aren't concerned
with winning Blue Ribbon points.

214
00:12:18,492 --> 00:12:21,154
We figure you've already slept
with all the umpires, so...

215
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,701
And we haven't committed to a partner
because we are concerned with winning.

216
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,498
- So there.
- You'd better choose soon,

217
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:29,619
- because the pickings are slim.
- Really ?

218
00:12:29,744 --> 00:12:31,882
- Who are you playing with ?
- The Omega Chi's.

219
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:34,918
It's an obvious match. The number one
houses always play together.

220
00:12:35,043 --> 00:12:37,354
But you know that.
ZBZ used to play with them...

221
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:39,299
until you were number four.

222
00:12:56,448 --> 00:12:58,457
Wait, can we split it ?

223
00:12:59,302 --> 00:13:00,702
My pick, my treat.

224
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,040
All right, fine.

225
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:08,829
- But I'm treating next time.
- If there is a next time.

226
00:13:08,998 --> 00:13:11,373
- We'll see how the rest of tonight goes
- Although,

227
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,547
we may have to choose...

228
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,070
something a little more low-budget.

229
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:18,147
No problem.

230
00:13:18,272 --> 00:13:22,174
We can go for coffee,
or a movie, or something simple.

231
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:24,668
That's funny.

232
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:27,296
Because we met, we had sex,

233
00:13:27,421 --> 00:13:29,224
then dinner and now coffee.

234
00:13:29,907 --> 00:13:31,893
It's like we're moving backwards.

235
00:13:32,216 --> 00:13:35,716
Who knows, maybe after coffee,
it'll be love at first sight.

236
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:38,859
Love at first sight ?
You really believe in that ?

237
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,034
You don't ?

238
00:13:41,401 --> 00:13:43,864
I learned in my Human Sexuality
class it's purely chemical.

239
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:46,881
The high you get from perceiving
someone as romantically appealing

240
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:49,259
is simply your brain responding
to an endorphin boost

241
00:13:49,384 --> 00:13:51,413
based on visual stimuli
and pheromones.

242
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:53,832
That's very clinical.
And cynical.

243
00:13:54,153 --> 00:13:55,834
It's clinically cynical.

244
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,852
It's a biological response.

245
00:13:58,193 --> 00:14:00,964
It's also probably why we jumped
right into bed when we first met.

246
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:02,783
So love doesn't exist ?

247
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:04,683
Nope.

248
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:08,283
I believe in dating
and relationships but...

249
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:10,347
love is a myth.

250
00:14:23,918 --> 00:14:25,363
That went well last night.

251
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:27,579
I tried to tolerate him

252
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:30,577
but he's just such a... such an...

253
00:14:32,109 --> 00:14:32,954
Omega Chi.

254
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:34,289
Hello, so am I.

255
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,306
Yeah, but you don't flaunt it.

256
00:14:36,431 --> 00:14:39,009
- Excuse me ?
- You know what I mean.

257
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:41,048
I can't spend time with him.
I'm sorry.

258
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:42,979
We'll have to hang out separately.

259
00:14:43,104 --> 00:14:44,448
I'm sure he's not thrilled

260
00:14:44,573 --> 00:14:46,400
- to spend time with me, either.
- Fine.

261
00:14:46,525 --> 00:14:48,538
He's got a study group tonight,
anyway, so...

262
00:14:48,663 --> 00:14:51,096
- if you don't have any plans...
- I don't have any plans.

263
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:53,975
You see ?
We can make this work.

264
00:14:54,918 --> 00:14:57,729
Yeah, but I refuse to be
your shared-custody child of divorce.

265
00:14:58,233 --> 00:15:00,357
You could have two birthdays
and two Christmases.

266
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:02,692
One of you will have
to give in, eventually.

267
00:15:03,052 --> 00:15:04,858
Totally. Eventually.

268
00:15:10,972 --> 00:15:14,578
I can't believe you guys
have poached eggs and hash browns !

269
00:15:14,703 --> 00:15:18,014
We have cereal, milk
and more cereal at our house.

270
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:19,960
I am walking you home every morning.

271
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,496
It's nice to see
chivalry isn't dead.

272
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:24,945
Girls, the Omega Chi's are here !

273
00:15:26,803 --> 00:15:29,893
Take me out to the ball game

274
00:15:30,018 --> 00:15:32,681
Take me out with the crowd

275
00:15:33,413 --> 00:15:36,623
Buy me some peanuts
and Cracker Jacks

276
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,393
I don't care if I never come back

277
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,663
Let me root, root root
for the home team

278
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,365
If they don't win it's a shame

279
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,329
'Cause it's one, two,
three strikes you're out 

280
00:15:49,454 --> 00:15:52,206
At the old ball game

281
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,584
Omega Chi would like
to cordially invite ZBZ

282
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:58,078
to partner with us for the All-Greek
Softball Tournament this weekend.

283
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,681
No, thank you!

284
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,631
We're going with the Kts. You guys are a
bunch of douchebags. Please leave.

285
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,200
It slipped, OK?

286
00:16:10,325 --> 00:16:13,503
It was buttered. I assure you
ladies that in no way reflects

287
00:16:13,628 --> 00:16:16,029
my ability to throw
an un-buttered softball.

288
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:19,500
OK, so you guys really want
to play with the Kts

289
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:23,337
after that demonstration
of athleticism?

290
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:27,258
Come on. There's
no need for profanities here.

291
00:16:29,964 --> 00:16:33,968
- The Kts asked us first.
- ZBZ is a democracy,

292
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,494
not let's all hang out with whatever
house Casey's current boyfriend's in.

293
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:41,464
So, all those in favor of
partnering with the Omega Chi's

294
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:43,992
for the softball tournament?

295
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,898
So, we cordially
accept your invitation.

296
00:17:05,271 --> 00:17:08,917
You kind of insulted
Cappie, and me, back there.

297
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:13,046
I'm sorry but after all
that crap about the cycle, slipping to

298
00:17:13,194 --> 00:17:17,198
number four-ish this is our chance to
show everyone that we're back on top.

299
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:21,375
They asked us, not the Gamma Psi's. Don't
you want to throw this in Natalie's face?

300
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,958
Attached to a brick.
But why would Omega Chi choose us?

301
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:28,236
Because we're moving up!
This is huge!

302
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:30,638
Are you so against this because
of your loyalty to Cappie?

303
00:17:30,843 --> 00:17:34,309
Or do you honestly believe it would
be better for us to play with KT

304
00:17:34,434 --> 00:17:36,284
than with the Omega Chi's?

305
00:17:36,409 --> 00:17:40,413
You know I love Cappie, but this is for
the good of the house.

306
00:17:40,573 --> 00:17:43,084
And there's no "I" in team. Or ZBZ.

307
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:46,387
I know. But the
Kts are so much more fun.

308
00:17:46,512 --> 00:17:49,648
Do you want to have fun,
or do you want to win?

309
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:59,659
Isn't this fun? Just the two of us?
We haven't hung out like

310
00:17:59,784 --> 00:18:02,227
- this in a while.
- Yeah, this is great.

311
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:07,187
Nice shot.
Have you been practicing?

312
00:18:07,312 --> 00:18:10,311
You're destroying me. After this
you wanna order.

313
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:14,553
A pizza and play some video games?
A little Call of Duty?

314
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:18,319
Why don't we call Grant?
He's great at that game.

315
00:18:18,444 --> 00:18:20,806
Helped me get past that crazy
level with all the tanks.

316
00:18:21,981 --> 00:18:24,359
What?
I gotta keep trying.

317
00:18:24,484 --> 00:18:28,273
Spitter. Man, I saw some pledges
not wearing their pledge pins again.

318
00:18:28,938 --> 00:18:31,399
It's no big deal.
I'm on it.

319
00:18:31,524 --> 00:18:35,336
What's going on, man?
Haven't seen you around in a while.

320
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:37,672
Not even the occasional
appearance at Gentleman's Choice.

321
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,707
I've been
a little bit domestic lately.

322
00:18:39,832 --> 00:18:43,515
I heard you're dating somebody in your
own house now. Who is that Marco, right?

323
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,780
No. Actually, his name is Grant.

324
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:49,317
- Cute?
- I just realized the two of you

325
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:52,756
- look way too much alike.
- So insanely hot. Totally get it.

326
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:56,524
Heath, we're just finishing
up our game. You wanna play winner?

327
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:59,841
- We were switching to video games?
- No, let's keep playing pool.

328
00:19:04,788 --> 00:19:07,270
Dang. You're up, Heath.

329
00:19:13,222 --> 00:19:17,226
I thought it was just supposed to be the
two of us? Separate time?

330
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:20,214
And you pull this stuff
with me and Heath.

331
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:21,950
Not cool, Rus.

332
00:19:22,484 --> 00:19:25,186
- I just figured...
- it was nice catching up.

333
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,230
Yeah.

334
00:19:27,612 --> 00:19:30,986
Wait, he knows he just won, right?

335
00:19:33,886 --> 00:19:37,231
I talked to Ash and she's pretty
set on playing with Omega Chi.

336
00:19:37,356 --> 00:19:40,709
- And so are the rest of the girls.
- You think Ashleigh's worried Beaver's

337
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:43,742
gonna date-movie molest her again?
Because we had a talk

338
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:46,841
- he's trying new clichémoves.
- That's awesome. But not the issue.

339
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:50,011
ZBZ's just been doing
a lot with KT lately

340
00:19:50,136 --> 00:19:53,448
the girls want to
branch out and maybe win.

341
00:19:53,573 --> 00:19:56,250
I totally understand.
Kts aren't jocks.

342
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,553
We can't run. We can't throw.

343
00:19:58,678 --> 00:20:00,621
Hell, we get winded
just tapping a keg.

344
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,091
Case, can I borrow your...

345
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,183
Boy on the floor!

346
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,621
She was a fiery little
pistol, wasn't she?

347
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:15,587
- So you're not mad?
- No. But I must warn you,

348
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:19,173
what we lack in physical
ability, we make up for in heart.

349
00:20:19,298 --> 00:20:22,977
And our hearts are set on crushing the
Omega Chi's at all things crushable.

350
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:26,381
I'm just sorry ZBZ will
become collateral damage.

351
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:29,984
- Really How do you plan on crushing us?
- Since you're playing with Omega Chi

352
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:33,976
we'll just have to team up with
some other very athletic sorority

353
00:20:34,101 --> 00:20:37,191
and kick your very attractive asses.

354
00:20:37,316 --> 00:20:39,151
Should I be scared?

355
00:20:39,651 --> 00:20:42,249
You care to make
a little friendly wager?

356
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,992
How much?

357
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,825
Something much more
valuable than money.

358
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,494
How about...

359
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,910
sexual favors.

360
00:20:52,035 --> 00:20:55,910
- Let's skip the betting.
- All right.

361
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:58,146
- Thanks for the movie.
- Yeah,

362
00:20:58,271 --> 00:21:01,675
I can't believe that was your first time
to see The Princess Bride. It's a classic.

363
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:05,285
"Mawwage." "Twoo wuv."

364
00:21:06,942 --> 00:21:09,791
Don't pretend like you
didn't tear up at the end.

365
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,685
Maybe I did.
What's your point?

366
00:21:11,884 --> 00:21:14,295
- "Twoo wuv?"
- Please.

367
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,331
It's a silly movie.
It's not real.

368
00:21:17,456 --> 00:21:19,233
There's no such thing.

369
00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:22,336
So you weren't in love with Cappie?

370
00:21:22,461 --> 00:21:25,616
No. Were you in love with Casey?

371
00:21:28,668 --> 00:21:31,946
- Yeah. I think so.
- Yeah, you're not with her nown so

372
00:21:32,071 --> 00:21:36,017
- what does that say about "twoo wuv?"
- It doesn't mean it can't happen.

373
00:21:36,142 --> 00:21:39,153
Like it did with my parents?
Or yours?

374
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:41,189
Not exactly the earth-shattering,

375
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:44,492
life-altering revelation they
make it out to be in the movies.

376
00:21:44,617 --> 00:21:46,757
That doesn't mean it's not real.

377
00:21:46,882 --> 00:21:48,863
Do you have proof?

378
00:21:48,988 --> 00:21:50,977
No. I just believe in it.

379
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:53,858
I believed in Santa Claus once, too.

380
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:04,155
I'm really sorry, Calvin.
You're right. That wasn't cool.

381
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:06,747
Grant can have you this weekend.

382
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:09,660
Grant might have me every weekend
if you keep pulling crap like that.

383
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,619
I know.

384
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:13,988
I just saw you and Heath
together and

385
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:17,401
it was really selfish.
I feel like a real jerk.

386
00:22:18,577 --> 00:22:21,329
If we're gonna do
this whole "separate" thing,

387
00:22:21,454 --> 00:22:25,050
- you might have to go somewhere else.
- Calvin told you about that?

388
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,191
- I had to be honest with him.
- What are you doing here?

389
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:31,067
I came to apologize for
what happened with Heath.

390
00:22:31,192 --> 00:22:33,063
Who's Heath?

391
00:22:35,635 --> 00:22:38,703
- You said you were nest.
- Not unnecessarily honest.

392
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,497
Calvin, who is Heath?

393
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:45,686
Heath is an ex... something.

394
00:22:45,811 --> 00:22:48,177
I don't really know
what to call him.

395
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:52,126
We definitely weren't
boyfriends. We just sort of dated,

396
00:22:52,251 --> 00:22:54,095
sort of...

397
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,855
What do you call
someone who's like that?

398
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,210
Fun-buddy.

399
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:04,172
Why am I nervous?

400
00:23:04,297 --> 00:23:07,575
I didn't do anything wrong. Rusty
was the one who tried to hook me up

401
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,702
with an ex fun-buddy.
But see, I just left.

402
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,438
He got out of there, and I
came to apologize for that.

403
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:17,051
Because that was wrong.
That was very wrong.

404
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:21,358
This is the guy you want me to be friends
with? Neither of us are interested.

405
00:23:21,714 --> 00:23:25,718
- Just give it a rest, Calvin.
- Girlfriend on the rag, Owens?

406
00:23:26,776 --> 00:23:29,471
I'm his boyfriend, J.P.

407
00:23:29,596 --> 00:23:33,348
Grant, he was just
messing around, OK?

408
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:43,813
Your boyfriend's super cute.

409
00:23:43,938 --> 00:23:46,247
I don't know how I'd feel
about him playing with

410
00:23:46,372 --> 00:23:50,241
a sorority full of mostly single,
attractive quality girls like Gamma Psi.

411
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:52,388
I just hope the fact

412
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:55,724
that ZBZ is playing with Omega Chi
doesn't harm your relationship.

413
00:23:55,936 --> 00:23:58,112
Good luck tomorrow!

414
00:24:00,453 --> 00:24:03,254
Gamma Psi's playing with
the Kts? How'd that happen?

415
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:06,801
- They asked us.
- And how'd that happen?

416
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:10,471
They waited so long, KT and
Psi Phi Pi were the only houses left.

417
00:24:10,596 --> 00:24:14,599
Apparently, our desire to crush
the Omega Chi's gave us the edge.

418
00:24:14,724 --> 00:24:17,778
With ZBZ as collateral
damage, that is.

419
00:24:17,903 --> 00:24:20,275
She gave me the schedule,
and apparently

420
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,732
KT and ZBZ will be playing together,
after all.

421
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:28,213
- Except on opposing teams.
- You're going down.

422
00:24:36,129 --> 00:24:40,072
- KT, I'm so glad you could join us.
- We're glad to be here.

423
00:24:40,197 --> 00:24:42,522
That was sarcasm.
You're late for warm-ups.

424
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:45,653
- You were serious about warm-ups?
- I'm always serious.

425
00:24:45,778 --> 00:24:47,561
She is.

426
00:24:50,187 --> 00:24:53,189
Teammate!
Captains' meeting at home plate.

427
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,106
Neat whistle.

428
00:24:58,231 --> 00:25:01,737
And your practice
looks very militant.

429
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,293
I never thought you'd be so
gung-ho about a softball tournament.

430
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:08,714
I might be beyond sorority politics
but I am gung-ho about winning.

431
00:25:10,104 --> 00:25:13,209
Ladies, don't make me
call your mothers!

432
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:16,179
Play ball!

433
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,502
Get it, get it, get it!

434
00:25:56,784 --> 00:25:59,055
Pledges! I got a hit.

435
00:25:59,256 --> 00:26:02,335
- Congratulations.
- Really awesome, Mr. Spitter.

436
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,150
Will you put down the cards
and show some KT pride? Look!

437
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:08,713
You should be cheering.

438
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,324
You should be running.

439
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,260
Atta boy now!

440
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:50,750
- Safe!
- Are you blind, ump?!

441
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:53,026
He was out! Are you crazy?

442
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:55,820
He was out! What are
you doing?! Are you an idiot?

443
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,531
- What are you talking about?
- He was out!

444
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:02,285
He clearly plopped on home plate.
How was he safe?

445
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:08,134
- The ump's on the take!
- What did he take?

446
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,502
Guys! We'll get the next one,
all right?

447
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:13,964
- He was out!
- Aww, man! This is so gay!

448
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:16,174
Really, Trip? What was gay about it?

449
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:18,711
I didn't mean it like that.
I just meant it was a lame call.

450
00:27:18,836 --> 00:27:21,103
- Maybe this isn't the time.
- I just want to make sure he

451
00:27:21,228 --> 00:27:23,549
understands those two words
mean completely different things.

452
00:27:23,674 --> 00:27:27,352
- Dude, don't be so touchy.
- Just drop the gay stuff, OK?

453
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:29,455
- He's right. It's not cool.
- Shut up, douche.

454
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,525
You touch the douche,
and we're out, OK?

455
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,328
Can you get thrown out of a game
for fighting with your own team?

456
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:38,388
Yeah. Break it up!
Everyone back on the field!

457
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,408
Will you just chill out?

458
00:27:42,644 --> 00:27:44,394
Play ball!

459
00:27:57,199 --> 00:28:00,319
All right, let's go, team!
Let's take these losers out!

460
00:28:01,011 --> 00:28:03,472
- Yeah, good one...
- Who wants some?!

461
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,582
Come on, Cap!
Hit a double play!

462
00:28:06,534 --> 00:28:09,103
Come on, Cappie!

463
00:28:20,051 --> 00:28:23,102
Batter, batter,
batter, batter, batter!

464
00:28:28,829 --> 00:28:31,459
That was overhand!

465
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:37,746
- Time!
- Time out!

466
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,825
What?

467
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,861
What the hell?
You could've really hurt him.

468
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:43,053
It was an accident.

469
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:45,030
Be more careful.
This is a friendly game.

470
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:46,890
Like you and the Gamma Psi's?

471
00:28:47,967 --> 00:28:50,703
Wait.
Can I ask you something?

472
00:28:50,828 --> 00:28:52,687
Were we in love?

473
00:28:52,863 --> 00:28:56,475
What? Is that why you
nearly took off his head?

474
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,479
- Are you still...?
- No! This isn't about us.

475
00:29:00,604 --> 00:29:03,180
I'm dating Rebecca.
We've gone out, like, twice.

476
00:29:03,305 --> 00:29:05,317
But she said she doesn't
believe in love.

477
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:07,994
- Any day now!
- And I can't believe

478
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:12,168
that we're talking about this here, now.
You've gone out twice. Relax. OK?

479
00:29:12,293 --> 00:29:15,728
Are you talking about me and Evan?

480
00:29:15,853 --> 00:29:19,381
I'm bored. Nothing happens
out there. And he's cute.

481
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:23,169
- Call him over, I want to meet him.
- Guys, we're in the middle of a game!

482
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:26,054
- But what does it matter if...
- What's his name?

483
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,432
Play ball!

484
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:33,507
Relax. Don't mess with people's
emotions. There will be time to flirt

485
00:29:33,632 --> 00:29:37,049
when we're not in an inning.
Now everyone get back to your positions.

486
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:39,498
And strike out my boyfriend.

487
00:29:39,623 --> 00:29:42,655
Come on, Cap!
Hit a grand slam!

488
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:45,584
The bases aren't loaded,
but thank you!

489
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:49,485
- Come on, Cappie!
- Come on, play ball!

490
00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:11,517
You OK?

491
00:30:11,642 --> 00:30:14,677
I'm fine. Just hope
my lungs don't explode.

492
00:30:14,802 --> 00:30:17,540
Did you see that line drive?

493
00:30:17,665 --> 00:30:21,656
- Payback's a bitch?
- His was an accident. I think.

494
00:30:21,781 --> 00:30:24,730
So was mine.
You think my aim's that good?

495
00:30:24,855 --> 00:30:27,600
And you're defending him now?
I see where your loyalties are.

496
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:30,536
On this field, I am first
and foremost a ZBZ

497
00:30:30,661 --> 00:30:33,305
- with Cappie's girlfriend a close second.
- Ouch, by the way.

498
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:36,308
- I'd put you above winning.
- Yeah, that's easy for you to say.

499
00:30:36,433 --> 00:30:39,512
I'll prove it to you.
I will lob you easy pitches.

500
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:42,630
You can stare'em down and let me
strike you out or you can swing away.

501
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,048
Or you could walk me.

502
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:47,218
I want to beat the Gamma Psi's just as
bad as you want to beat the Omega Chi's.

503
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:49,302
Good point.

504
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:52,388
We'll have
to wait and see what happens.

505
00:30:52,513 --> 00:30:55,110
You're just...

506
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:59,632
Seriously, though, the Omega Chi's
got three of my brothers expelled.

507
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:02,259
I've never wanted
to win more in my life.

508
00:31:04,014 --> 00:31:06,821
Although, you can't win just by
getting on base, know what I mean?

509
00:31:11,214 --> 00:31:13,946
All you have to do is get on base.

510
00:31:14,071 --> 00:31:16,275
- No pressure?
- All right.

511
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,020
- Let's go, Casey!
- "And then, responding to the cheers,

512
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:25,104
she lightly doffed her hat.
No stranger in the crowd could doubt

513
00:31:25,229 --> 00:31:29,233
- it was Casey at the bat."
- Rusty, I am trying to concentrate.

514
00:31:29,358 --> 00:31:33,163
I memorized that poem
in, like, fourth grade.

515
00:31:46,336 --> 00:31:47,804
Strike one!

516
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,507
Come on, Zeta Beta!

517
00:31:52,192 --> 00:31:54,470
Throw the heat!

518
00:31:57,881 --> 00:32:00,016
Strike two!

519
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,332
One more, Cappie!

520
00:32:08,744 --> 00:32:11,070
- Time! Time!
- Time out!

521
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:14,306
My foot fell asleep. Rusty,
can I talk to you? Come here.

522
00:32:20,514 --> 00:32:24,518
I am no doctor. Try noving it
around a little. Get the blood flowing.

523
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:28,272
It's not my foot. It's Cappie.
Should I throw the game for him,

524
00:32:28,397 --> 00:32:32,401
or make a hit so ZBZ can win? Because
we really need the Blue Ribbon points.

525
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:35,928
Then try to get a hit out there.
You're playing for ZBZ.

526
00:32:36,053 --> 00:32:39,365
Although, I could understand
putting a personal relationship

527
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,000
above house feuds.

528
00:32:44,795 --> 00:32:48,006
- That doesn't help me at all.
- What do you want me to say?

529
00:32:48,176 --> 00:32:50,933
- Play ball!
- Go, Casey!

530
00:32:57,065 --> 00:32:59,475
Come on, one more, Cap!

531
00:34:11,854 --> 00:34:15,054
I told you we should have gone
with the Psi Phi Pi's.

532
00:34:16,474 --> 00:34:18,347
Well, congrats on your win.

533
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:20,820
I would say a full "congratulations"

534
00:34:20,945 --> 00:34:23,021
but I removed the second half
of the word

535
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:25,437
for your Omega Chi teammates.

536
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:28,315
I refuse to offer them
any "ulations."

537
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:31,985
Thanks. And thanks
for throwing me easy pitches.

538
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,861
It was slow-pitch.
You were supposed

539
00:34:33,986 --> 00:34:35,948
- to strike out for me.
- I'm sorry !

540
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:38,075
You wanted to beat the OC, but we...

541
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:41,495
needed the Blue Ribbon points
to help us get back to number one.

542
00:34:41,956 --> 00:34:44,461
- And I like to win.
- Really ?

543
00:34:44,586 --> 00:34:47,372
 Because we're in a relationship
doesn't mean I'm gonna stop trying.

544
00:34:47,497 --> 00:34:50,097
It wasn't just about
Blue Ribbon points ?

545
00:34:51,428 --> 00:34:52,965
You think I'm too competitive ?

546
00:34:53,711 --> 00:34:56,468
It's one of the things
I love most about you.

547
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,632
- Hi.
- Hey Casey.

548
00:35:04,377 --> 00:35:06,523
Is Ashleigh in attendance ?

549
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:11,442
I wish to apologize
for my inappropriate advances

550
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,818
the other night.

551
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:13,787
And...

552
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:20,546
it would please me very much

553
00:35:20,671 --> 00:35:23,661
to escort her to dinner and a movie.

554
00:35:25,307 --> 00:35:26,507
Appropriately.

555
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:33,714
I saw her a second ago...
there she is.

556
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:45,019
How you doing ?

557
00:35:46,817 --> 00:35:47,770
He'll be fine.

558
00:35:53,922 --> 00:35:54,972
What's up ?

559
00:35:56,137 --> 00:35:58,287
Can you believe that back there ?

560
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,248
I just wish Grant
would chill sometimes.

561
00:36:01,969 --> 00:36:03,119
I don't know.

562
00:36:04,781 --> 00:36:07,781
I may not like Grant
for my own personal reasons,

563
00:36:08,406 --> 00:36:10,751
but I think he was right
to tell that guy off.

564
00:36:11,031 --> 00:36:14,171
He was standing up for himself.
I think you should, too.

565
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,652
Are you trying to tell me
how to be gay ?

566
00:36:16,777 --> 00:36:19,426
- Because you don't know what it's like.
- I know. You're right.

567
00:36:19,864 --> 00:36:21,625
I was made fun of in high school

568
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,430
and I never stood up for myself.

569
00:36:23,978 --> 00:36:25,128
I wish I did.

570
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:27,975
I wish I was more
like Grant back then.

571
00:36:37,293 --> 00:36:38,278
Good game.

572
00:36:39,056 --> 00:36:39,917
Thanks.

573
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,908
And thanks for the support
on the whole "that's so gay" thing.

574
00:36:48,231 --> 00:36:50,213
I am sorry. All right ?

575
00:36:50,338 --> 00:36:51,708
Yes, it offends me, too.

576
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:55,942
When you stand up like that,
you make our whole relationship

577
00:36:56,067 --> 00:36:58,067
this huge political statement.

578
00:36:58,669 --> 00:37:00,759
And it doesn't have to be like that.

579
00:37:02,105 --> 00:37:05,180
Times have changed.
It's not like it was 50 years ago.

580
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,190
You're right.
Times are changing,

581
00:37:07,315 --> 00:37:09,065
but they haven't changed.

582
00:37:09,576 --> 00:37:12,646
I wasn't ready to come out
of the closet for a reason.

583
00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:15,440
I do think it's my responsibility

584
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,259
to stand up for myself,

585
00:37:17,384 --> 00:37:20,115
because I want to be proud
of who I am.

586
00:37:21,785 --> 00:37:25,450
And not allow other people
to make me feel bad about it.

587
00:37:30,138 --> 00:37:30,999
See ?

588
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,293
I told you he was great.

589
00:37:41,805 --> 00:37:42,905
Grant Ellis.

590
00:37:44,163 --> 00:37:46,363
Educating straight people since...

591
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:47,664
last week.

592
00:37:54,233 --> 00:37:56,283
You look pretty hot in uniform.

593
00:37:59,113 --> 00:38:00,664
You look pretty hot in anything.

594
00:38:03,378 --> 00:38:06,074
Why'd you guys choose us
over the Gamma Psi's ?

595
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,702
- Aren't they the number one house ?
- Well...

596
00:38:08,871 --> 00:38:12,616
I might have done some lobbying
on ZBZ's behalf, for...

597
00:38:14,038 --> 00:38:15,375
personal reasons.

598
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,191
About our conversation
the other night.

599
00:38:21,316 --> 00:38:23,211
Right. Don't even worry about that.

600
00:38:23,336 --> 00:38:24,968
Because all I want to know now,

601
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,137
is "when's our next date" ?

602
00:38:30,138 --> 00:38:30,938
Guys !

603
00:38:31,668 --> 00:38:34,659
So, Pete just had a great idea.
He thinks the four of us should go out

604
00:38:34,784 --> 00:38:36,933
on a double-date next weekend.
What do you think ?

605
00:38:39,399 --> 00:38:41,944
Yes ! A double-date next week. Neat.

606
00:38:43,424 --> 00:38:46,406
- What do you think, Evan ?
- I think it's a great idea.

607
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:58,169
I'm glad you're spending
the night here tonight.

608
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,146
We have so much gossip
to catch up on,

609
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:01,962
I don't even know where to start.

610
00:39:02,087 --> 00:39:03,840
- Cappie and I...
- Wait ! Yes, I do.

611
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:07,219
The cute Omega Chi
playing left-base asked me out !

612
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:10,180
I know.
You've told me about 20 times.

613
00:39:10,889 --> 00:39:13,816
Did I mention that Beaver
was looking for you at Dobler's ?

614
00:39:13,941 --> 00:39:15,769
Are you trying to ruin
my new boy buzz ?

615
00:39:16,195 --> 00:39:18,397
No, I just miss you.

616
00:39:18,566 --> 00:39:20,586
Now you're double-dating
with Evan and Rebecca

617
00:39:20,711 --> 00:39:23,608
- instead of me and Cappie.
- Well...

618
00:39:24,703 --> 00:39:26,446
Maybe by the time I marry Pete,

619
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,785
the KT-Omega Chi feud will be over.

620
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,982
And Cappie can even be
in the wedding party.

621
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:36,872
I almost let Cappie
talk me out of winning today.

622
00:39:37,981 --> 00:39:40,210
- Someone found the "I" in team.
- No.

623
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,503
I meant, us.

624
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:42,404
ZBZ.

625
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,744
And for a second there,

626
00:39:44,869 --> 00:39:48,531
I was considering
striking out for him.

627
00:39:51,206 --> 00:39:52,456
Should I have ?

628
00:39:53,597 --> 00:39:56,560
When am I supposed to compromise
what I want for a relationship ?

629
00:40:00,091 --> 00:40:02,841
This is going to be trickier
than I thought.

630
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:13,338
I saw you talking to Calvin at Dobler's.
How's all that going ?

631
00:40:13,463 --> 00:40:14,313
Well...

632
00:40:14,607 --> 00:40:17,204
I tried to tolerate Grant,
like you said.

633
00:40:17,451 --> 00:40:18,915
But it didn't work out.

634
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:21,721
- Too much of a jerk ?
- Yeah.

635
00:40:21,846 --> 00:40:23,746
But not him. I was the jerk.

636
00:40:23,871 --> 00:40:26,892
I couldn't see past the fact
that he's an Omega Chi.

637
00:40:27,017 --> 00:40:28,117
But today...

638
00:40:28,242 --> 00:40:31,595
- I saw a side of him I liked.
- The side that looks like Heath ?

639
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:33,796
I'm not saying we're best friends

640
00:40:33,921 --> 00:40:35,952
or anything like that,
but it's a start.

641
00:40:38,253 --> 00:40:40,353
- Sorry I'm late.
- Dumptruck ?

642
00:40:43,343 --> 00:40:46,293
- Where's your pledge pin ?
- Right here. Chill.

643
00:40:47,282 --> 00:40:50,182
- Take it off your pants.
- Take off my pants ?

644
00:40:50,767 --> 00:40:53,412
Take the pin off your pants
and put it on your shirt,

645
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:54,910
where it's supposed to be.

646
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:57,759
It's your responsibility
to be proud of who you are.

647
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,331
That pin is a symbol

648
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:01,622
of KT pride and tradition.

649
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:04,451
And The second you stop
respecting that,

650
00:41:04,576 --> 00:41:06,226
then someone else does...

651
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:08,381
then someone else does...

652
00:41:09,682 --> 00:41:11,676
then it means nothing anymore.

653
00:41:16,337 --> 00:41:18,571
Now get back in there
and join your brothers.

654
00:41:18,696 --> 00:41:20,796
Let's get this show on the road.

655
00:41:20,998 --> 00:41:24,356
- Go Pledge Educator Spitter.
- Yep. Rusty Cartwright.

656
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:27,624
Educating KT pledges since...

657
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,111
right now.

658
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:30,129
Up top.

659
00:41:31,227 --> 00:41:34,720
- What movie are we watching ?
- The best baseball movie ever.

660
00:41:34,845 --> 00:41:35,905
Field of Dreams ?

661
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:38,206
- Bull Durham ?
- The Natural ?

662
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,819
A League of Their Own.

663
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:57,681
I love this movie so much.

664
00:41:58,835 --> 00:42:00,831
There's no crying in baseball.

665
00:42:02,244 --> 00:42:03,144
Fade in.

666
00:42:03,269 --> 00:42:06,418
The year is 1943
in Rockford, Illinois,

667
00:42:06,543 --> 00:42:10,402
And World War II has threatened
to shut down Major League Baseball.

668
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,989
But not if Madonna can help it.

669
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:15,357
That's right !
