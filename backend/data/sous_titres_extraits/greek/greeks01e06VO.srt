00:00:00,047 --> 00:00:01,484
<i>Previously on</i> Greek...

2
00:00:01,615 --> 00:00:04,141
I'm Rebecca Logan.
Casey's my big sis in the sority.

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,075
You're senator Logan's daughter!

4
00:00:06,181 --> 00:00:07,597
You didn't mention you knew her.

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,511
Should've known my brother
would volunteer.

6
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:12,012
- Way to take one for the team.
- Pledging's about sacrifice.

7
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,315
- That is impressive.
- Thanks, big sis.

8
00:00:14,402 --> 00:00:17,215
But if you really want to win,
you have to be willing to play dirty.

9
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:18,399
Right, Becs?

10
00:00:18,635 --> 00:00:20,551
- Who sent it?
- I bet it's from Rebecca.

11
00:00:20,552 --> 00:00:21,572
She didn't do this.

12
00:00:21,581 --> 00:00:23,697
- Someone else's holding the camera.
- Where's Rusty?

13
00:00:23,688 --> 00:00:25,925
- What's the big emergency?
- Lisa Lawson, Cap?

14
00:00:26,057 --> 00:00:28,166
She's even easier to get
into bed than you are.

15
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:30,762
Really? Damn it, I'm losing my edge.

16
00:00:30,913 --> 00:00:33,013
Hey, Rusty. Remember me?

17
00:00:33,144 --> 00:00:35,367
Jen K. Crushed baskets. Yeah.

18
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:38,061
Did you ever think that you
might have an unsecret admirer?

19
00:00:38,157 --> 00:00:39,545
Do you like me?

20
00:00:40,655 --> 00:00:43,478
Spitter, spitter, spitter!

21
00:01:12,488 --> 00:01:13,879
Calm down, Jamie Lee.

22
00:01:13,975 --> 00:01:16,040
- It's just me.
- I know.

23
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,484
That nail polish is super scary.

24
00:01:18,606 --> 00:01:19,818
You serious?

25
00:01:19,931 --> 00:01:21,809
I have a crucial question to ask you.

26
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,034
Do these need more rhinestones?

27
00:01:25,314 --> 00:01:27,897
Ash! They're puffy paint perfection.

28
00:01:28,026 --> 00:01:29,384
The pledges are gonna flip.

29
00:01:29,501 --> 00:01:30,426
I know, right?

30
00:01:30,985 --> 00:01:32,848
I don't get why you're going
through trouble.

31
00:01:32,839 --> 00:01:34,706
We didn't have a slumber party
when we were pledges.

32
00:01:34,697 --> 00:01:36,499
It's simple: Today's pledges

33
00:01:36,611 --> 00:01:37,766
are tomorrow's voters.

34
00:01:37,852 --> 00:01:41,357
Wow, you said obama was cute,
but this campaign event seems extreme.

35
00:01:41,482 --> 00:01:43,725
For Zeta Beta president, you dork.

36
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:46,626
With Frannie and the rest of
the house away at the Indiana game,

37
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:49,500
it's the perfect opportunity
for me to impress the girls.

38
00:01:49,764 --> 00:01:53,269
There are a ton of fun exercises in
my pledge educator handbook.

39
00:01:53,377 --> 00:01:55,723
After tonight, the girls will
be bonded to each other,

40
00:01:55,836 --> 00:01:59,009
to Zeta Beta, and, most of all, to me.

41
00:01:59,103 --> 00:02:01,472
- They must be so excited.
- Oh, that's the best part.

42
00:02:01,563 --> 00:02:04,505
I told them to pack
for a mystery location.

43
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:07,459
I can't wait to surprise them.

44
00:02:07,547 --> 00:02:11,087
We missed an away game to
spend the night in the living room?

45
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,190
Girls,

46
00:02:12,217 --> 00:02:14,530
tonight is about sisterhood.

47
00:02:14,643 --> 00:02:17,404
It's about all of us taking
the time to connect

48
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:19,123
on a deeper level.

49
00:02:19,263 --> 00:02:22,752
By morning, we'll truly be sisters.

50
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:26,786
Now,

51
00:02:26,956 --> 00:02:28,681
who's up for a trust fall?

52
00:02:35,534 --> 00:02:36,879
<i>A thunderstorm watch is in effect...</i>

53
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,799
Okay, so...
I finished mopping the floors.

54
00:02:39,899 --> 00:02:41,834
Cleaned the bathrooms. Anything else?

55
00:02:41,946 --> 00:02:44,099
Yeah, just one more thing.

56
00:02:44,202 --> 00:02:46,306
It's time to repaint the kitchen.

57
00:02:48,648 --> 00:02:51,599
It's Friday night. Everyone
else is out of town at the game.

58
00:02:51,888 --> 00:02:53,816
Oh, poor pledge Owens.

59
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:55,803
I drew the short stick
and got house duty too,

60
00:02:55,804 --> 00:02:57,661
but you don't see me getting all teary.

61
00:02:57,753 --> 00:03:00,839
Now, come on. If I'm here,
than my little bro is here.

62
00:03:02,387 --> 00:03:03,711
All right, where's the paint?

63
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:05,630
I'm screwing with you!

64
00:03:06,007 --> 00:03:08,964
Come on.
Plant a cheek, let's hang out for a bit.

65
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:12,718
Huh, well, actually...

66
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,756
What?
You got some place you'd rather be?

67
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:16,680
No. No.

68
00:03:17,221 --> 00:03:19,432
No, this is...

69
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,014
Great.

70
00:03:29,146 --> 00:03:31,262
- Wanna watch TV?
- Love TV!

71
00:03:36,357 --> 00:03:37,357
Damn!

72
00:03:41,353 --> 00:03:44,038
- Looks like we got a mouse.
- That sucks.

73
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,669
You know what sucks

74
00:03:45,861 --> 00:03:48,547
is you pledges still
don't know how to clean.

75
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,426
Coming up next, Alien.
Hey, check it out, Alien.

76
00:04:44,654 --> 00:04:46,001
Why the long face?

77
00:04:46,741 --> 00:04:48,705
This party's got your
three favorite things:

78
00:04:48,801 --> 00:04:50,511
Beer, girls,

79
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:52,425
and a severe weather warning.

80
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,227
I'm in a funk, spitter.

81
00:04:54,355 --> 00:04:57,269
Come on! Look at all
the hot mommas here.

82
00:04:57,634 --> 00:05:00,373
I'm currently off the market
because I'm in a relationship.

83
00:05:00,495 --> 00:05:03,132
But if I didn't have a girlfriend,
I'd be all over this.

84
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,240
Subtle.

85
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,163
What about her?
We call her "saran wrap."

86
00:05:12,462 --> 00:05:13,529
Clingy.

87
00:05:18,847 --> 00:05:21,367
- She's pretty.
- Her perfume gives me hives.

88
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,140
Cappie.

89
00:05:25,134 --> 00:05:26,872
What could be wrong with her?

90
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,205
- Sleep apnea.
- You are in a funk.

91
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,911
Yeah, I just feel like I'm watching
tv and all that's on is reruns.

92
00:05:32,912 --> 00:05:33,927
You know?

93
00:05:34,012 --> 00:05:36,375
Maybe I just need a
furlough from the females.

94
00:05:36,766 --> 00:05:39,677
I could spend some time indulging
my other interests like beer

95
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:41,282
and "Days of Our Lives".

96
00:05:41,377 --> 00:05:43,065
And mentoring today's youth.

97
00:05:43,158 --> 00:05:44,488
Speaking of which,

98
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:46,347
Tell me about this girlfriend of yours.

99
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,162
Well,

100
00:05:50,714 --> 00:05:52,660
her name is Jen K.

101
00:05:53,073 --> 00:05:56,547
And she has these soft,
fluffy, pink lips

102
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:58,524
that I could kiss forever.

103
00:06:01,258 --> 00:06:02,258
Hold that thought.

104
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,109
My Harley popped a flat down the road.

105
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,732
Can I come in?

106
00:06:25,955 --> 00:06:27,783
Dear God, yes.

107

00:06:36,926 --> 00:06:38,681
GREEK 106 "Friday Night Frights"

109
00:06:38,793 --> 00:06:40,764
Synchro: Flolo, Kasius

110
00:06:47,231 --> 00:06:50,193
Okay, everyone has a partner?

111
00:06:50,898 --> 00:06:52,815
Best Friday night ever, right?

112
00:06:52,932 --> 00:06:55,528
Way better than reruns
of "Ghost Whisperer".

113
00:06:55,627 --> 00:06:57,979
Can't believe we've been
pledge sisters for six weeks

114
00:06:58,105 --> 00:06:59,271
but we've barely even spoken.

115
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,097
It boggles the mind.

116
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:04,738
This about trusting that your
sisters will always be there for you.

117
00:07:04,865 --> 00:07:06,937
That they will catch you when you fall.

118
00:07:07,021 --> 00:07:10,712
And trusting that they won't be skanky
sluts who sleep with your boyfriend.

119
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:12,496
So when you're ready

120
00:07:12,627 --> 00:07:16,295
fall back and feel the support
of the Zeta Beta sisterhood.

121
00:07:22,668 --> 00:07:24,582
- Oh, ouija board!
- Oh!

122
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:27,007
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

123
00:07:27,303 --> 00:07:28,552
Mm, brain pain.

124
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:31,720
- Who wants to go first?
- Oh, I do!

125
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,219
We'll have plenty of time later

126
00:07:34,238 --> 00:07:36,604
once we get through my agenda
of team building activities.

127
00:07:36,655 --> 00:07:39,738
Casey, this corporate retreat
has been a non-stop fun fest.

128
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:42,877
But what better way to learn
about the Zeta Beta legacy than

129
00:07:42,986 --> 00:07:45,479
by talking to some old, dead sisters?

130
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,685
Yeah!

131
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:49,552
That is, unless you're scared.

132
00:07:49,756 --> 00:07:53,103
Rebecca, you should know that I'm
not scared of things that are evil.

133
00:07:53,183 --> 00:07:54,404
Prove it.

134
00:07:54,505 --> 00:07:55,505
Fine,

135
00:07:55,606 --> 00:07:57,399
and then we can move on.

136
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:06,023
Is anyone there?

137
00:08:13,444 --> 00:08:14,927
Looks like nobody's home.

138
00:08:15,022 --> 00:08:17,718
They must be at the football game.

139
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,877
Look!

140
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,200
A spirit moves among us.

141
00:08:24,302 --> 00:08:26,289
Please. Rebecca totally moved it.

142
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:29,223
Spirit, tell us who you are.

143
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,890
V...

144
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,901
i...

145
00:08:36,026 --> 00:08:38,326
r...

146
00:08:38,432 --> 00:08:39,860
g...

147
00:08:39,981 --> 00:08:41,814
i...

148
00:08:41,914 --> 00:08:44,469
n...

149
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:48,113
"Virgin."
I stand corrected. It's not Rebecca.

150
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:53,165
Now back to bonding.
How about some pledge trivia?

151
00:08:53,264 --> 00:08:54,917
Or we could tell ghost stories.

152
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:56,280
Yeah.

153
00:08:59,795 --> 00:09:02,175
Welcome to Kappa Tau.

154
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,874
I'm Cappie, your humble servant.

155
00:09:05,006 --> 00:09:06,348
Cappie, huh?

156
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,100
- Cute.
- So I've been told.

157
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,998
And, uh, and... and you are?

158
00:09:13,477 --> 00:09:15,139
Destiny.

159
00:09:15,657 --> 00:09:19,241
Exotic, cosmic.
Me likey.

160
00:09:22,037 --> 00:09:25,855
These are other people.
May I take your jacket?

161
00:09:25,995 --> 00:09:27,857
Fine.

162
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,023
- Destiny, you are...
- Thirsty.

163
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,041
- Pour me a drink?
- What would you like?

164
00:09:43,146 --> 00:09:45,041
Something with a bite to it.

165
00:09:45,135 --> 00:09:49,117
I'll get you something
you can sink your teeth into.

166
00:09:51,855 --> 00:09:54,936
- So should we call someone?
- Why?

167
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,901
To fix your bike.

168
00:09:57,046 --> 00:09:58,637
Oh, right.

169
00:09:58,745 --> 00:10:00,816
I'll let the storm blow over.

170
00:10:00,938 --> 00:10:02,619
Are you a student?

171
00:10:02,724 --> 00:10:06,423
You ask a lot of questions.
Do I need to have my lawyer present?

172
00:10:09,705 --> 00:10:11,067
Kidding.

173
00:10:13,778 --> 00:10:16,411
You learn to ask that in prison.

174
00:10:17,824 --> 00:10:19,853
Kidding.

175
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:24,983
She's odd.

176
00:10:25,096 --> 00:10:26,397
Yeah.

177
00:10:27,686 --> 00:10:30,048
Oddly hot.

178
00:10:38,142 --> 00:10:40,395
Let me guess. It's from my brother.

179
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:45,989
My, oh, my, isn't he Captain Romance.

180
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:48,242
How's the head wound?

181
00:10:48,354 --> 00:10:51,405
I'm not showing any signs of concussion,
so I should be okay.

182
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:53,354
- Are you pre-med?
- No,

183
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:55,241
just clumsy.

184
00:10:55,384 --> 00:10:57,213
I see.

185
00:10:57,382 --> 00:11:00,376
So I guess this proves
Rebecca Logan can't be trusted.

186
00:11:00,516 --> 00:11:02,991
That was proven long ago.

187
00:11:03,115 --> 00:11:06,293
- Via text message.
- Exactly.

188
00:11:06,694 --> 00:11:08,013
Wait a second.

189
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:10,443
How'd you know about that video?

190
00:11:10,571 --> 00:11:13,369
- I sent it to you.
- What?

191
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,797
Rebecca and I were
in the same rush group.

192
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:19,270
I had a front row seat that
night for her little indiscretion.

193
00:11:19,397 --> 00:11:21,927
I thought you deserved to know about it.

194
00:11:22,728 --> 00:11:25,927
- That video was really painful to watch.
- So I shouldn't have sent it.

195
00:11:26,036 --> 00:11:29,849
No. No, I'm glad you did.

196
00:11:29,991 --> 00:11:33,320
In a weird way,
it helped me process and purge.

197
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:40,977
I can't believe you were
the cell phone Scorsese.

198
00:11:41,107 --> 00:11:42,267
Scorsese? You think?

199
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,181
I thought the framing was a little off,
especially towards the end.

200
00:11:45,786 --> 00:11:47,407
I'm sorry.

201
00:11:47,508 --> 00:11:49,614
Sometimes I misinterpret snappy banter.

202
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,345
Just know that I
was only trying to help.

203
00:11:53,461 --> 00:11:56,311
No matter what, there's always
one pledge who's on your side.

204
00:11:56,422 --> 00:11:58,648
- Thanks, Jen K.
- Oh, I didn't mean me.

205
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,657
I was talking about Mandy.

206
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:02,196
Funny.

207
00:12:02,661 --> 00:12:03,751
You're really funny.

208
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,267
I can see why my brother's so into you.

209
00:12:07,614 --> 00:12:10,287
Legend has it
the ghost was a spirit

210
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:11,983
of an old student

211
00:12:12,446 --> 00:12:14,037
who was the golden girl on campus.

212
00:12:14,146 --> 00:12:16,692
Class president,
prom queen, all that crap.

213
00:12:16,817 --> 00:12:20,557
But she'd suffered
a horrible humiliation.

214
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:23,302
I heard it was some sort of sex scandal.

215
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:27,493
Anyway, she became the laughing
stock of the entire school.

216
00:12:28,387 --> 00:12:32,198
And the humiliation... made her snap!

217
00:12:32,311 --> 00:12:33,747
She took a razor blade

218
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:37,640
and slashed the throats of
the most popular girls at school.

219
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:40,472
Then she arranged the bodies

220
00:12:40,491 --> 00:12:42,727
in an elaborate fake slumber party.

221
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:45,509
And that's how they found her.

222
00:12:45,685 --> 00:12:47,094
Covered in blood,

223
00:12:47,654 --> 00:12:50,244
pretending she had friends.

224
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:01,396
Dobler's is closed!

225
00:13:01,521 --> 00:13:03,406
Can you freakin' believe it?

226
00:13:03,527 --> 00:13:06,395
- Perhaps because of the tornado watch?
- So?

227
00:13:06,505 --> 00:13:08,271
It's Karaoke Friday.

228
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,738
Their loss. I was gonna do
my reggae version of "Lady Marmalade."

229
00:13:11,868 --> 00:13:13,062
Ash,

230
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,907
Rebecca is totally
hijacking my slumber party.

231
00:13:16,033 --> 00:13:18,372
She's in there telling ghost stories.

232
00:13:18,494 --> 00:13:20,188
Help me get control back.

233
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,157
No problem. Let me handle this.

234
00:13:23,656 --> 00:13:25,420
Everyone listen up.

235
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:29,218
Did you know that a Z. B.Z.
died in this house?

236
00:13:29,338 --> 00:13:30,848
Ash.

237
00:13:31,551 --> 00:13:34,351
Her name was Virginia.

238
00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:36,673
I bet that was what the
ouija board was spelling.

239
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,956
Yeah.

240
00:13:41,314 --> 00:13:44,235
See? Told ya.

241
00:13:49,148 --> 00:13:50,393
Ah, man!

242
00:13:50,512 --> 00:13:52,727
She was just about to
blow it out the airlock!

243
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,898
- Thanks.
- What?

244
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,864
- Now I know how it ends.
- I'm sorry.

245
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,790
Gotcha.

246
00:14:02,312 --> 00:14:03,778
Who's easy now?

247
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:06,566
I've seen that movie, like, 87 times.

248
00:14:07,954 --> 00:14:10,485
Cell phones are out too.

249
00:14:11,095 --> 00:14:13,543
What can two guys do alone in the dark?

250
00:14:16,457 --> 00:14:18,208
How about we catch that mouse?

251
00:14:18,874 --> 00:14:20,587
- Great idea.
- Yeah.

252
00:14:23,702 --> 00:14:26,393
Did you arrange this lighting?

253
00:14:27,045 --> 00:14:30,003
Well, I do look best in candlelight.

254
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,303
And how do I look?

255
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,277
You look...

256
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,865
familiar.

257
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,105
Let me guess.

258
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,641
You've seen me in your dreams.

259
00:14:47,776 --> 00:14:50,559
Come on, Cappie.
Is that the best you've got?

260
00:14:52,437 --> 00:14:54,529
I love your smile. I just want to

261
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,023
put it in my pocket.

262
00:14:56,155 --> 00:14:58,303
I love your eyes.

263
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,816
I wanna gouge them out
and wear them on a chain around my neck.

264
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:09,767
You're a little bit twisted.

265
00:15:10,468 --> 00:15:11,869
Refreshing.

266
00:15:11,996 --> 00:15:16,081
Cap, can I borrow a candle?
I'm gonna look for some flashlights.

267
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,019
...knocked out power
lines throughout the area.

268
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:41,111
Everyone is advised to stay inside.

269
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,699
She came here on purpose.

270
00:16:16,956 --> 00:16:21,048
Hold the hysteria, everyone.
It's just a storm.

271
00:16:21,311 --> 00:16:24,216
- Or is it Virginia?
- There is no Virginia.

272
00:16:24,561 --> 00:16:26,580
- Right, Ash?
- Then...

273
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,105
why did they make this?

274
00:16:31,716 --> 00:16:33,190
What is that doing there?

275
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,042
Frannie hung it there. She said
it was too depressing for daily viewing.

276
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:39,238
I wonder how she died.

277
00:16:39,338 --> 00:16:41,222
She was probably murdered...

278
00:16:41,322 --> 00:16:43,134
by a serial killer...

279
00:16:43,257 --> 00:16:45,396
who ate her.

280
00:16:46,537 --> 00:16:49,538
Please...
I'm sure she died of something boring,

281
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:50,908
like cancer.

282
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,136
And, ash, we don't know
that she died in the house.

283
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:54,727
If only we could Google her.

284
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,903
Ah, but we can't.

285
00:16:56,997 --> 00:16:58,469
Moving on. How about

286
00:16:58,576 --> 00:17:01,706
we all gather 'round
for a sharing circle?

287
00:17:02,107 --> 00:17:05,677
- We could use these!
- Oh, right... books...

288
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,474
Duh.

289
00:17:10,816 --> 00:17:12,666
Light, spitter.

290
00:17:12,802 --> 00:17:15,051
- Spitter, cut it out.
- Sorry.

291
00:17:15,185 --> 00:17:17,528
- Wade, have you seen Cappie?
- No.

292
00:17:18,214 --> 00:17:20,590
That girl Cappie's
with has been lying to us.

293
00:17:20,698 --> 00:17:22,925
She said she came across
this house by accident,

294
00:17:23,045 --> 00:17:25,300
but I found our address in her purse.

295
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:28,813
What should we do? Wade, you there?

296
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,347
Okay, Alien versus Aliens. Discuss.

297
00:17:43,455 --> 00:17:45,653
What's there to discuss? Alien.

298
00:17:45,768 --> 00:17:49,534
Sigourney Weaver. Uh, Ridley Scott.
It's in a different league.

299
00:17:49,658 --> 00:17:52,992
Yeah, I don't know, though. I don't
know. I mean, Aliens had James Cameron.

300
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,762
And Paul Reiser.

301
00:17:54,855 --> 00:17:57,975
Paul Reiser? You call that an argument?

302
00:17:58,097 --> 00:18:00,531
No, Alien is a classic.

303
00:18:00,645 --> 00:18:02,615
Like Jaws.

304
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,398
Uh, please don't... don't bring up Jaws.

305
00:18:07,078 --> 00:18:08,936
My sister died in a shark attack.

306
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,384
Yeah, right.

307
00:18:10,485 --> 00:18:13,460
No, it's true. It was two summers ago.

308
00:18:13,961 --> 00:18:16,072
We were taking surfing
lessons in Hawaii.

309
00:18:16,174 --> 00:18:18,801
She'd just caught her first wave.

310
00:18:19,202 --> 00:18:22,044
I'll never forget the smile on her face.

311
00:18:23,234 --> 00:18:25,581
Then all of a sudden,
out of nowhere, a fin appeared.

312
00:18:25,696 --> 00:18:27,396
Oh, my God.

313
00:18:27,764 --> 00:18:29,308
Yeah.

314
00:18:29,407 --> 00:18:31,527
We screamed for her to paddle, but

315
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:33,506
it was too late.

316
00:18:34,598 --> 00:18:36,490
The shark attacked.

317
00:18:37,814 --> 00:18:39,812
She screamed.

318
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,708
I can't believe you're
buying this, Calvin.

319
00:18:43,841 --> 00:18:45,868
Oh, you jackass!

320
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,594
No, no... I don't even have a sister.
Only brothers,

321
00:18:49,716 --> 00:18:51,122
and an addiction to horror movies.

322
00:18:51,235 --> 00:18:52,615
- Oh, same here.
- Really?

323
00:18:52,747 --> 00:18:55,787
Oh, yeah. When I was a kid,
my parents would only let me watch PBS.

324
00:18:55,918 --> 00:18:56,920
Yeah.

325
00:18:57,073 --> 00:18:59,199
And then late at night,
I would sneak downstairs

326
00:18:59,311 --> 00:19:01,126
and stay up all night
watching horror movies.

327
00:19:01,117 --> 00:19:04,403
Yeah, watching two inches away from
the screen, keep the volume really low.

328
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:06,583
- Totally, which made it even scarier.
- I know!

329
00:19:06,743 --> 00:19:09,210
Plus in those 1980s slasher movies,

330
00:19:09,332 --> 00:19:11,221
there's always a hot girl
flashing her boobs.

331
00:19:11,371 --> 00:19:13,538
Yeah.

332
00:19:15,356 --> 00:19:16,592
You hear that?

333
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,003
- Evan.
- What?

334
00:19:19,106 --> 00:19:21,659
It's right behind you.

335
00:19:30,434 --> 00:19:33,868
- Yeah, you'll pay for that, Owens.
- That's for your dead sister.

336
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,948
- Ahh!
- What?

337
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,986
I think I'm gonna need a bigger spatula.

338
00:19:53,668 --> 00:19:55,379
Cappie?

339
00:20:00,803 --> 00:20:02,153
Manly scream you got there.

340
00:20:03,658 --> 00:20:05,410
Yeah, well...
you surprised me.

341
00:20:06,896 --> 00:20:08,741
- Have you seen Cappie?
- I'm not his mother.

342
00:20:09,076 --> 00:20:10,400
- The bathroom this way?
- Yeah.

343
00:20:11,114 --> 00:20:12,114
Destiny, wait.

344
00:20:14,658 --> 00:20:15,658
Why are you here?

345
00:20:15,699 --> 00:20:17,597
Someone needs to work
on their listening.

346
00:20:17,712 --> 00:20:18,712
I told you.

347
00:20:18,904 --> 00:20:20,134
My bike broke down.

348
00:20:20,589 --> 00:20:21,789
How do you explain this?

349
00:20:22,903 --> 00:20:24,777
- Where did you get that?
- Never mind that.

350
00:20:24,831 --> 00:20:25,893
I'm on to you.

351
00:20:32,363 --> 00:20:33,363
Nice one, Spitter.

352
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:40,114
Who are you?

353
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:41,797
Sydney Bristow?

354
00:20:43,737 --> 00:20:45,991
Okay, listen...
I came here to see Cappie.

355
00:20:46,065 --> 00:20:47,090
You know him?

356
00:20:50,053 --> 00:20:52,782
We went to camp Kitchi-Wa-Wa
together ten years ago.

357
00:20:53,751 --> 00:20:54,869
Why didn't you just say so?

358
00:20:57,831 --> 00:20:59,313
God, this is so embarrassing.

359
00:21:02,268 --> 00:21:03,852
My real name isn't Destiny.

360
00:21:03,956 --> 00:21:04,956
It's Patty.

361
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,247
Back in camp, I was the fat girl.

362
00:21:08,675 --> 00:21:09,924
Total outcast.

363
00:21:10,315 --> 00:21:12,461
Cappie was the only thing
that made it worthwhile.

364
00:21:13,187 --> 00:21:14,883
I has such a crush on him.

365
00:21:15,703 --> 00:21:17,448
But he was part of the cool crowd.

366
00:21:18,808 --> 00:21:22,096
So I promised myself that one day
I'd make him notice me.

367
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:23,619
You chose tonight?

368
00:21:23,753 --> 00:21:25,355
Well, I drove up from West Virginia.

369
00:21:25,374 --> 00:21:27,745
Just my luck
there's a freakin' hurricane outside.

370
00:21:28,844 --> 00:21:30,112
Let's get Cappie and tell him.

371
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:31,558
No!

372
00:21:33,182 --> 00:21:34,710
No, this is our little secret.

373
00:21:34,822 --> 00:21:36,913
If you tell Cappie,
it'll ruin our moment.

374
00:21:38,426 --> 00:21:40,438
He deserves to know who you really are.

375
00:21:40,606 --> 00:21:42,208
This is who I really am.

376
00:21:42,933 --> 00:21:44,705
Are you the same person
you were back then?

377
00:21:47,249 --> 00:21:48,249
No, I'm not.

378
00:21:48,627 --> 00:21:50,845
See?
I swear I'll tell him eventually.

379
00:21:50,938 --> 00:21:51,738
Cool?

380
00:21:53,368 --> 00:21:56,333
Fine. Could you please release
your kung fu grip?

381
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:57,744
This is me being gentle.

382
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,619
If I wanted to,
I could snap it like a twig.

383
00:22:01,314 --> 00:22:02,859
I'm real glad we had this chat.

384
00:22:06,606 --> 00:22:07,606
I found her!

385
00:22:07,836 --> 00:22:09,474
Oh, my God.
She's wearing the "rachel."

386
00:22:09,604 --> 00:22:11,356
Hello!
Hair cliché!

387
00:22:11,932 --> 00:22:13,981
It says here
that she was pledge educator.

388
00:22:14,118 --> 00:22:15,168
Just like you, Casey.

389
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,420
Really?

390
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,598
I wonder if she planned a slumber party.

391
00:22:19,064 --> 00:22:20,443
In fact, she ran for president.

392
00:22:20,927 --> 00:22:23,682
But according to these minutes,
she lost by one vote...

393
00:22:24,332 --> 00:22:25,916
to Trudy Henderson.

394
00:22:26,754 --> 00:22:27,758
Oh, my gosh.

395
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:29,064
What?

396
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,953
The election was the day she died.

397
00:22:32,838 --> 00:22:35,651
You guys,
I found out how Virginia croaked.

398
00:22:36,132 --> 00:22:38,194
She hung herself from the chandelier.

399
00:22:41,757 --> 00:22:44,435
She must've been really depressed
about losing the election.

400
00:22:44,547 --> 00:22:45,572
How sad.

401
00:22:45,777 --> 00:22:46,818
Sad?

402
00:22:46,988 --> 00:22:48,006
It's pathetic.

403
00:22:48,069 --> 00:22:50,931
Who makes that big of a deal
about a stupid sorority election?

404
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,469
You are hypnotizing me with those hips,
aren't you?

405
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:20,773
Go ahead.

406
00:23:21,562 --> 00:23:23,052
Try and pinch an inch.

407
00:23:23,984 --> 00:23:25,170
You can't, can you?

408
00:23:25,915 --> 00:23:26,958
You're perfect.

409
00:23:29,045 --> 00:23:30,946
I'm perfect for you.

410
00:23:32,706 --> 00:23:33,806
I couldn't agree more.

411
00:23:35,352 --> 00:23:37,085
Cappie, you gotta come quick.

412
00:23:38,464 --> 00:23:39,516
What is it, Lassie?

413
00:23:39,593 --> 00:23:40,786
Is the barn burning down?

414
00:23:41,084 --> 00:23:43,525
Yeah, can't you see we're kind of busy?

415
00:23:43,674 --> 00:23:45,835
It's Beaver.
He's drunk.

416
00:23:47,202 --> 00:23:48,573
And he's peeing in your closet.

417
00:23:49,822 --> 00:23:51,126
Not again.

418
00:23:52,143 --> 00:23:54,265
All right, stay here.
I'll be right back.

419
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:07,203
Well, they're urine-free.

420
00:24:07,323 --> 00:24:08,739
You must've given him stage fright.

421
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:10,100
Cap, we don't have much time.

422
00:24:10,137 --> 00:24:11,744
That's why we should live in the moment.

423
00:24:11,889 --> 00:24:13,746
No, I mean until Destiny finds us.

424
00:24:14,138 --> 00:24:15,442
She's not who you think she is.

425
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,101
- She's not a hot girl?
- No, she is...

426
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,742
Then she's exactly who I think she is.

427
00:24:20,637 --> 00:24:21,641
But you know her!

428
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:23,525
She went to camp with you.

429
00:24:24,215 --> 00:24:25,015
What?

430
00:24:25,703 --> 00:24:29,153
Listen, I might die for telling you
this, but her name isn't Destiny.

431
00:24:29,364 --> 00:24:32,364
- It's Patty.
- Patty... from camp.

432
00:24:35,828 --> 00:24:38,530
The only patty
there was Patty the Fatty.

433
00:24:42,389 --> 00:24:44,533
Oh, my God...
she's Patty the Fatty.

434
00:24:47,141 --> 00:24:50,319
What are the odds that she'd get
a flat tire outside of our house?

435
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,120
Oh, my God.
She came to see me.

436
00:24:55,489 --> 00:24:57,185
She's always had a crush on you.

437
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,644
She spent the past ten years
getting in shape

438
00:24:59,793 --> 00:25:01,899
so you two could have a second chance.

439
00:25:02,514 --> 00:25:03,703
That is really...

440
00:25:03,889 --> 00:25:05,287
- Insane? What?
- Hot!

441
00:25:05,306 --> 00:25:07,989
A fat girl turned into a hot chick
for me?

442
00:25:09,846 --> 00:25:11,597
It's like a Reese Witherspoon movie.

443
00:25:12,013 --> 00:25:14,340
She went through all that trouble
just to get into shape.

444
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:16,826
The least I can do is reward her
for her effort, right?

445
00:25:17,274 --> 00:25:18,571
But she sounds crazy.

446
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,639
Crazy like a fox.

447
00:25:20,788 --> 00:25:24,235
A super fox in leather, to be specific.
I'm flattered.

448
00:25:24,869 --> 00:25:26,583
You need to relax.

449
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,029
Listen, no... Cap.

450
00:25:28,951 --> 00:25:30,296
I think she's dangerous.

451
00:25:31,094 --> 00:25:32,286
She's really strong.

452
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,851
She's got these crazy eyes.

453
00:25:34,794 --> 00:25:36,769
You're really mowing
that grassy knoll, huh?

454
00:25:38,219 --> 00:25:39,919
I think I can handle her, Spitter.

455
00:25:47,772 --> 00:25:48,906
Breathe, girls.

456
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:50,791
In through the nose,

457
00:25:51,257 --> 00:25:52,412
out through the mouth.

458
00:25:53,046 --> 00:25:54,984
This is all because of the storm.

459
00:25:55,105 --> 00:25:57,565
The storm entered the house
and knocked down the chandelier?

460
00:25:58,715 --> 00:26:00,839
The chandelier is older than Madonna.

461
00:26:00,969 --> 00:26:03,858
We've been trying to get an electrician
in here for weeks to secure it.

462
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:07,356
The wind made the house vibrate
which was enough to make it fall.

463
00:26:07,673 --> 00:26:10,282
But Casey, I saw the electrician
in here last week.

464
00:26:10,431 --> 00:26:13,033
- That's not possible.
- This has got to be Virginia.

465
00:26:13,223 --> 00:26:15,371
She is one pissed poltergeist.

466
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:21,731
You're freaking the girls out.

467
00:26:21,722 --> 00:26:22,922
Good, then it's working.

468
00:26:23,067 --> 00:26:24,794
- What the hell is your problem?
- Listen,

469
00:26:24,838 --> 00:26:27,106
these girls might buy
your slumber party bonding crap,

470
00:26:27,201 --> 00:26:28,281
but I see right through it.

471
00:26:28,412 --> 00:26:29,604
You just want their votes.

472
00:26:29,716 --> 00:26:31,722
- That's not true.
- It's good politics.

473
00:26:31,783 --> 00:26:32,933
I'm actually impressed.

474
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:34,860
- Then why are you sabotaging it?
- Well...

475
00:26:34,956 --> 00:26:37,563
first, there's the whole arch
nemesis thing. But also,

476
00:26:37,564 --> 00:26:39,446
I feel my pledge sisters deserve to see

477
00:26:39,483 --> 00:26:41,402
how their future leader reacts
in a crisis.

478
00:26:42,135 --> 00:26:43,381
Wait, everyone shut up.

479
00:26:43,607 --> 00:26:44,763
I know how to fix this.

480
00:26:45,974 --> 00:26:48,526
We need to have a seance.

481
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,188
Great idea!

482
00:27:01,841 --> 00:27:02,841
See anything?

483
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:04,798
Not yet.

484
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,620
It's too fat to have gone far.

485
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,420
3:00.

486
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,541
All right, begin Operation Rodent
round up.

487
00:27:28,719 --> 00:27:31,512
Dinner time, Mr. Rat.

488
00:27:37,176 --> 00:27:38,176
On three.

489
00:27:39,388 --> 00:27:41,103
- Ready?
- Ready.

490
00:27:42,865 --> 00:27:43,665
One...

491
00:27:45,138 --> 00:27:45,938
Two...

492
00:28:02,716 --> 00:28:03,925
What the hell was that?

493
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:16,038
Watcha watching?

494
00:28:16,865 --> 00:28:21,001
Freaky, delusional romance
that could have deadly consequences.

495
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,126
So do you know how to work this thingy?

496
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:28,453
Wondering when the cell service
is gonna be back.

497
00:28:31,662 --> 00:28:33,357
Cool.
It's like magic.

498
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:38,371
Actually it's a simple crank generator
that turns friction into electricity.

499
00:28:39,462 --> 00:28:40,856
Or magic!

500
00:28:41,045 --> 00:28:44,079
<i>This just in. Officials at Stoneybrook
mental institution report</i>

501
00:28:44,117 --> 00:28:46,446
<i>that one of their patients escaped
during the storm.</i>

502
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,999
<i>She's described
as a caucasian woman, 5'8"...</i>

503
00:28:52,093 --> 00:28:53,093
<i>... years old.</i>

504
00:28:53,118 --> 00:28:54,907
<i>Listeners are warned to avoid contact</i>

505
00:28:54,963 --> 00:28:58,037
<i>since the woman is considered unstable
and extremely dangerous.</i>

506
00:29:00,168 --> 00:29:01,168
Scary.

507
00:29:03,564 --> 00:29:04,564
You have no idea.

508
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:10,152
- We're ready.
- This is ridiculous, Ash.

509
00:29:10,674 --> 00:29:13,152
Trust me.
I had a goth phase in middle school.

510
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,923
This seance will work.

511
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:17,081
Yeah, Casey, we've got
to see this through.

512
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,059
Virginia' spirit's trying
to tell us something.

513
00:29:19,086 --> 00:29:21,005
Probably that there's no such thing
as ghosts.

514
00:29:22,515 --> 00:29:24,144
We all must be quiet

515
00:29:24,613 --> 00:29:25,673
and relaxed.

516
00:29:26,207 --> 00:29:27,894
Everyone, close your eyes
and hold hands.

517
00:29:28,052 --> 00:29:29,189
and hold hands.

518
00:29:32,602 --> 00:29:33,515
Clammy.

519
00:29:34,061 --> 00:29:35,216
Virginia Horton,

520
00:29:35,533 --> 00:29:39,782
the sisters of Zeta Beta Zeta invite you
to commune with us.

521
00:29:43,055 --> 00:29:44,875
Maybe she has her cell phone turned off.

522
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,274
Sorry, you were possessed.

523
00:29:55,535 --> 00:29:57,436
Her spirit passed through me.

524
00:29:58,927 --> 00:29:59,933
She's here.

525
00:30:00,473 --> 00:30:03,911
Ashleigh, could you ask the ghost
what she wants so we can move on?

526
00:30:05,086 --> 00:30:06,086
Virginia,

527
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:07,769
tell us what you want.

528
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,177
I bet she wants us
to get back to bonding.

529
00:30:22,494 --> 00:30:24,506
You guys, it's just the wind.

530
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:29,423
I'm not so sure.

531
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:45,891
What do you think that was back there?

532
00:30:46,002 --> 00:30:47,102
No idea.

533
00:30:47,456 --> 00:30:49,971
I'm just... hoping
it doesn't bleed acid.

534
00:30:52,654 --> 00:30:53,791
Don't worry, little bro.

535
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:55,093
I'll protect you.

536
00:30:56,362 --> 00:30:57,853
Why do you think I need protecting?

537
00:31:00,955 --> 00:31:02,781
You seemed a little scared, that's all.

538
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:06,784
Me? No, I've faced some pretty
vicious animals in my day.

539
00:31:08,923 --> 00:31:09,923
See that?

540
00:31:10,097 --> 00:31:13,190
My little sister's bunny, Flopsie,
took a chunk out of it.

541
00:31:13,514 --> 00:31:15,769
I need four stitches and a tetanus shot.

542
00:31:16,347 --> 00:31:17,409
That's nothing.

543
00:31:19,434 --> 00:31:22,042
Petting zoo, 1998.
Got attacked by a rogue goat.

544
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,204
Six stitches and they closed
the zoo for a week.

545
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:29,006
Paper route, eighth grade, rabid poodle
attack, 12 stitches and I passed out.

546
00:31:29,242 --> 00:31:30,938
Poodle?
Try a polo horse.

547
00:31:30,939 --> 00:31:33,932
Fell off one four years ago,
got a concussion and a CAT Scan.

548
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,520
Head trauma, huh?

549
00:31:35,751 --> 00:31:37,718
- Explains a lot.
- What?

550
00:31:43,196 --> 00:31:44,202
It's on the move.

551
00:31:49,164 --> 00:31:51,792
Guys, there's no such thing as ghosts.

552
00:31:52,389 --> 00:31:53,389
Right, Ashleigh?

553
00:31:55,536 --> 00:31:56,784
You can never be too safe.

554
00:31:59,588 --> 00:32:01,619
Casey, tell them
they're being ridiculous.

555
00:32:02,555 --> 00:32:04,922
Well, you did call Virginia pathetic.

556
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,609
- Everyone heard you.
- But I was kidding!

557
00:32:08,585 --> 00:32:11,064
I was kidding!
It was just a joke!

558
00:32:14,611 --> 00:32:15,611
Loose brick.

559
00:32:18,446 --> 00:32:19,246
Look.

560
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:21,338
The ghost is writing us notes.

561
00:32:24,936 --> 00:32:26,445
Virginia's such a pretty name.

562
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,056
I don't think these are notes.

563
00:32:30,461 --> 00:32:31,654
I think these are votes.

564
00:32:32,205 --> 00:32:33,905
Then that can only mean one thing.

565
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,080
Someone fixed the election.

566
00:32:38,891 --> 00:32:41,563
The minutes said that Virginia lost
by one vote.

567
00:32:42,016 --> 00:32:44,625
But if these were counted,
she would've won.

568
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,923
know what we have to do.

569
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,468
- All clear.
- Sweep the room.

570
00:33:00,652 --> 00:33:01,807
We really make a good team.

571
00:33:02,553 --> 00:33:05,143
Like Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker.

572
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:13,079
To think I thought
we wouldn't get along.

573
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:15,751
- Really?
- You know, you're...

574
00:33:16,769 --> 00:33:17,769
you know.

575
00:33:18,954 --> 00:33:20,069
I'm what?

576
00:33:21,704 --> 00:33:23,099
You're pals with Rusty.

577
00:33:25,518 --> 00:33:27,883
Him and I aren't exactly<i> amigos.</i>

578
00:33:28,233 --> 00:33:30,469
Yeah, I know.
I was there for Paddlegate.

579
00:33:35,816 --> 00:33:37,381
It's cool you can see beyond that, man.

580
00:33:37,578 --> 00:33:38,945
Well, you know, I just,

581
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,164
try to stay out
of other people's business.

582
00:33:41,536 --> 00:33:42,336
I do.

583
00:33:42,828 --> 00:33:45,434
And I respect that. You know
how many people want in my business

584
00:33:45,435 --> 00:33:46,717
just because I'm a Chambers?

585
00:33:47,269 --> 00:33:49,090
Yeah, it's crazy how...

586
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:51,588
one little word can define you.

587
00:33:52,267 --> 00:33:53,267
Totally.

588
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,885
Evan, there's something
I think you should know.

589
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,206
What is it?

590
00:34:02,142 --> 00:34:03,964
Giant snake!
Above you!

591
00:34:04,987 --> 00:34:05,987
Nice try...

592
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:15,784
Get away from him, you bitch!

593
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,456
Get it off me!

594
00:34:21,933 --> 00:34:23,834
Counter-clockwise!

595
00:34:37,844 --> 00:34:39,503
I really need to talk to you.

596
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,729
Dude, give me a second.

597
00:34:57,018 --> 00:34:58,068
It's just number one.

598
00:35:00,327 --> 00:35:01,927
The bathroom is that way, Beave!

599
00:35:02,763 --> 00:35:04,142
Why do you keep moving it?

600
00:35:38,289 --> 00:35:39,289
What the hell?

601
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,540
Do you like my art project?

602
00:35:56,003 --> 00:35:58,624
I can see you're influenced
by the deconstructionist movement.

603
00:35:59,088 --> 00:36:00,088
Sit down.

604
00:36:00,767 --> 00:36:01,792
We're not done.

605
00:36:03,062 --> 00:36:04,812
I'm really good at arts and crafts.

606
00:36:05,149 --> 00:36:06,230
I can see that.

607
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,777
This is what I did every day at camp.

608
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:10,176
Alone,

609
00:36:10,596 --> 00:36:12,645
while everybody else played kickball

610
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
and rode horses.

611
00:36:15,753 --> 00:36:18,724
Well, creativity is
a much more transferable skill.

612
00:36:19,127 --> 00:36:22,000
I'd imagine this was me and Cappie
holding hands for eternity.

613
00:36:22,111 --> 00:36:23,301
I can see the resemblance.

614
00:36:23,564 --> 00:36:26,214
Now I kind of picture this as us
and all our friends.

615
00:36:27,106 --> 00:36:28,875
Look...
this is you.

616
00:36:32,617 --> 00:36:34,327
- Listen, Patty...
- Destiny!

617
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:35,439
Destiny.

618
00:36:37,961 --> 00:36:39,041
I know what it's like

619
00:36:39,899 --> 00:36:41,744
to want to go back
and revise history.

620
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,386
I wasn't always this cool frat guy
you see before you.

621
00:36:47,114 --> 00:36:48,605
This can't change the past.

622
00:36:49,561 --> 00:36:51,311
You can't make someone love you.

623
00:36:51,812 --> 00:36:52,964
Yes, I can!

624
00:36:54,311 --> 00:36:56,746
Tonight is going to be perfect,

625
00:36:57,547 --> 00:36:58,666
you'll see.

626
00:36:59,376 --> 00:37:02,376
Because I have waited too long
to let anything mess this up.

627
00:37:02,561 --> 00:37:03,561
Or anyone.

628
00:37:21,484 --> 00:37:23,552
- You remembered me.
- Of course...

629
00:37:24,186 --> 00:37:25,393
from the moment you walked in.

630
00:37:25,413 --> 00:37:28,580
How could I ever forget the way
the water glistened off your

631
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,649
wonder woman bathing suit.

632
00:37:32,686 --> 00:37:35,081
You didn't stand up for me.
You let them call me names.

633
00:37:35,137 --> 00:37:37,094
I know, and that was wrong.

634
00:37:37,561 --> 00:37:39,384
I was young and stupid.

635
00:37:40,563 --> 00:37:42,165
Do you have any idea what it's like

636
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:44,663
to love someone who's caused you
so much pain?

637
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:52,937
Cappie, look out!

638
00:38:09,561 --> 00:38:10,561
That's it?

639
00:38:11,563 --> 00:38:12,563
Excuse me?

640
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,498
I lost 80 pounds for that?

641
00:38:17,688 --> 00:38:19,477
I've never had any complaints before.

642
00:38:19,514 --> 00:38:20,763
Let me just try a better angle.

643
00:38:20,813 --> 00:38:22,697
No, that's okay.
Listen, it's been fun, but...

644
00:38:23,112 --> 00:38:24,305
I really need a donut.

645
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:27,375
Stay in touch.

646
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,281
Sisters of Zeta Beta Zeta,
this election is called to order.

647
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,900
Our president is the person
who shapes the future of our sisterhood.

648
00:38:46,169 --> 00:38:47,939
It is a role that requires vision,

649
00:38:48,479 --> 00:38:50,492
tenacity, and grace.

650
00:38:50,748 --> 00:38:52,198
So choose wisely.

651
00:38:52,785 --> 00:38:54,369
We have two candidates this evening.

652
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,809
Virginia Horton and...

653
00:38:58,498 --> 00:38:59,748
What's that chick's name?

654
00:39:00,819 --> 00:39:02,813
- Trudy Henderson.
- Trudy Henderson.

655
00:39:03,642 --> 00:39:06,487
Would anyone like to make a supporting
statement for either candidate?

656
00:39:13,065 --> 00:39:15,934
I'd just like to say that Virginia seems
like the clear choice.

657
00:39:16,427 --> 00:39:18,475
She's by far the skinniest,

658
00:39:18,644 --> 00:39:20,750
prettiest, most worthy candidate.

659
00:39:20,937 --> 00:39:22,799
She's definitely not pathetic...

660
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:25,384
in any way.

661
00:39:25,682 --> 00:39:27,638
Thank you, pledge Logan.

662
00:39:28,248 --> 00:39:30,016
Let's get on with the voting.

663
00:39:30,751 --> 00:39:32,285
All in favor of Virginia Horton

664
00:39:32,585 --> 00:39:33,585
raise your hand.

665
00:39:35,454 --> 00:39:36,554
Well, it looks like...

666
00:39:36,628 --> 00:39:39,108
- Wait, hold on. I'm not done counting.
- It looks unanimous.

667
00:39:40,749 --> 00:39:42,038
Virginia Horton wins.

668
00:39:43,311 --> 00:39:44,611
Congratulations, Virginia.

669
00:39:45,687 --> 00:39:48,338
This is election is adjourned.

670
00:39:50,617 --> 00:39:51,617
Now what?

671
00:39:51,998 --> 00:39:53,674
Now we can get on with our evening.

672
00:39:53,954 --> 00:39:54,960
Do you think it worked?

673
00:40:00,269 --> 00:40:01,406
Apparently so.

674
00:40:02,335 --> 00:40:04,123
Let's hear it for Casey, everybody.

675
00:40:06,935 --> 00:40:08,648
Now who's up for some ice cream?

676
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,363
It looks like you owe Casey your life.

677
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,817
The exterminator's gonna be here
in two hours.

678
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:32,869
Two hours?

679
00:40:33,172 --> 00:40:34,733
Okay, I think we can make it 'til then.

680
00:40:38,683 --> 00:40:40,109
What do we tell the guys?

681
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:44,561
I say we never speak of this again.

682
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:48,907
Everybody's got their secrets, right?

683
00:40:49,934 --> 00:40:50,934
Right.

684
00:41:08,303 --> 00:41:11,601
<i>In other news, police have apprehended
the escaped mental patient.</i>

685
00:41:11,872 --> 00:41:14,916
<i>Officials say that luckily
the 60-year-old woman had a bad hip</i>

686
00:41:15,284 --> 00:41:17,054
<i>and was unable to travel far.</i>

687
00:41:18,498 --> 00:41:19,937
Could I be a bad kisser?

688
00:41:20,434 --> 00:41:23,172
It's like having a dangling booger.
Someone would tell me, right?

689
00:41:23,434 --> 00:41:25,384
Cap, you can't listen to what she said.

690
00:41:25,621 --> 00:41:27,234
She was crazy, after all.

691
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:29,009
She wasn't crazy, she was in love.

692
00:41:29,963 --> 00:41:31,584
It's a fine line between the two.

693
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,226
She drove here
from West Virginia to find you.

694
00:41:34,434 --> 00:41:35,934
She went after what she wants.

695
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:38,759
You have to admire that.

696
00:41:39,123 --> 00:41:40,323
But what did it get her?

697
00:41:40,934 --> 00:41:41,934
Closure.

698
00:41:42,872 --> 00:41:43,875
Now she can move on.

699
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:45,029
Guys,

700
00:41:45,471 --> 00:41:47,558
look who I found outside.

701
00:41:47,814 --> 00:41:49,212
Hey, Timmy!

702
00:41:49,822 --> 00:41:51,518
I'm so glad that I found you.

703
00:41:52,794 --> 00:41:54,825
Who's my buddy?
Who's my buddy?

704
00:41:56,581 --> 00:41:59,126
- What's up with the redecorating?
- Just putting Virginia back

705
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:00,117
where she belongs.

706
00:42:00,403 --> 00:42:02,448
After tonight, she deserves
to be up there.

707
00:42:07,147 --> 00:42:08,761
Yeah, funny thing about tonight...

708
00:42:09,076 --> 00:42:12,002
what a coincidence that these votes
were hidden in the fireplace.

709
00:42:13,435 --> 00:42:14,435
I know, right?

710
00:42:14,727 --> 00:42:16,236
And what's more impressive
