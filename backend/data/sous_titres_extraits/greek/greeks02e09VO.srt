1
00:00:00,081 --> 00:00:01,263
Previously...

2
00:00:01,383 --> 00:00:02,505
<i>Speed dating?!</i>

3
00:00:02,665 --> 00:00:05,383
This whole thing reeks
of desperation{\if you ask me}. No offense.

4
00:00:05,544 --> 00:00:06,842
So, what now?

5
00:00:07,086 --> 00:00:09,888
All I know is, I'm in college
and I had fun with you.

6
00:00:10,008 --> 00:00:11,873
- What about Michael?
- <i>What do you want?</i>

7
00:00:11,993 --> 00:00:13,600
{\I think that }We should break up.

8
00:00:14,552 --> 00:00:16,638
Our new ZBZ president is

9
00:00:16,806 --> 00:00:18,104
- Ashleigh.
- What?

10
00:00:18,265 --> 00:00:20,606
How's that possible?
You weren't even in the running.

11
00:00:20,768 --> 00:00:22,480
I had great ideas for this house.

12
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,110
Did you? Cause I didn't hear any.

13
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:26,654
You played the politics perfectly
but great politicians

14
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:28,238
are supposed to inspire people,

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,991
not be better than the alternative.

16
00:00:30,152 --> 00:00:33,391
- I can't believe I lost.
- You may not be president,

17
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:35,830
but that doesn't mean
you can't lead the house.

18
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,862
Good morning, prez!

19
00:00:42,982 --> 00:00:45,511
You all set for your first
officers' meeting?

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,086
I guess so.

21
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,127
- How are you doing?
- Good.

22
00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:51,185
{\You know, }I'm going to have
some free time now

23
00:00:51,305 --> 00:00:53,806
so I thought
I'd get a head start on finals.

24
00:00:54,257 --> 00:00:55,902
I know you better than that.

25
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:57,434
This is crazy awkward{\, right}?

26
00:00:57,806 --> 00:01:00,270
You should be president, not me.

27
00:01:00,432 --> 00:01:03,066
I didn't even run.
I have no business being president.

28
00:01:03,642 --> 00:01:04,590
You know,

29
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,503
I'm going to announce my resignation
at the meeting and appoint you.

30
00:01:07,623 --> 00:01:08,821
I can do that.

31
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:11,048
You can't do that.

32
00:01:11,323 --> 00:01:13,462
Really? See?
No business.

33
00:01:13,582 --> 00:01:14,875
You should've won.

34
00:01:15,205 --> 00:01:17,719
I was so preoccupied
with beating Frannie,

35
00:01:17,839 --> 00:01:20,500
I never considered
what the house really wanted.

36
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:22,660
You won the election,

37
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,962
they want you.

38
00:01:27,403 --> 00:01:28,756
We'd better get a move on.

39
00:01:28,876 --> 00:01:31,340
How would it look if you were late
to your first{\officers'} meeting?

40
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,934
Pretty bad, right?

41
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,741
I just...

42
00:01:35,861 --> 00:01:37,710
I pass this on to you
in the meeting.

43
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,177
It's a ritual.

44
00:01:39,297 --> 00:01:41,479
It's in he book
of rules and rituals.

45
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:43,668
OK, then, we'd better
follow the book.

46
00:01:43,851 --> 00:01:46,349
Which I'll give you
at the meeting, too.

47
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:55,593
Two more weeks left in
freshmen year, isn't that crazy?

48
00:01:57,086 --> 00:01:59,235
Which means we only have
2 more weeks to do

49
00:01:59,355 --> 00:02:01,583
all the things we wanted
to do in the dorm.

50
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:02,888
Such as?

51
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:06,694
We always talked about sleeping
overnight in the laundry room dryers.

52
00:02:06,814 --> 00:02:08,442
Or sneaking up onto the roof.

53
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:11,034
No, I've got too much respect
for law and country

54
00:02:11,154 --> 00:02:12,993
and not enough time
for shenanigans.

55
00:02:13,113 --> 00:02:15,370
I gotta find my new dorm
for next year.

56
00:02:15,863 --> 00:02:19,238
I'm leaning toward Appleby and Wohlford,
but the bathroom situation is not ideal.

57
00:02:19,358 --> 00:02:23,108
I mean, come on. Low-flush toilets?
That's not gonna get the job done.

58
00:02:23,228 --> 00:02:25,113
- I thought you'd stay here.
- I can't.

59
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:27,437
My new roommate's not
in honors engineering.

60
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,386
You already have a new roommate?

61
00:02:31,712 --> 00:02:34,212
Well, you're shipping off
to Kappa Torrid,

62
00:02:34,332 --> 00:02:36,713
and I couldn't just wait around
and see what kind of nutbag

63
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,497
the school stuck me with.

64
00:02:38,789 --> 00:02:40,328
So who's the lucky guy?

65
00:02:40,797 --> 00:02:42,648
My old purity pledge bro, Kirk.

66
00:02:43,506 --> 00:02:45,459
The one who goes
to Bob Jones University?

67
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:46,319
Went.

68
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:49,501
It's in South Carolina and the climate
wreaked havoc on his adenoids,

69
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:51,155
so he's transferring.

70
00:02:51,275 --> 00:02:54,130
But he's more or less
the coolest dude I know.

71
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:57,265
Don't mind if he stays
with us for a few days?

72
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,145
Just to get our routine down.

73
00:03:00,751 --> 00:03:03,169
Of course not. When are you
planning on him coming here?

74
00:03:03,289 --> 00:03:05,063
I don't know exactly.

75
00:03:08,468 --> 00:03:09,649
My god, you're crazy.

76
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:13,238
- How long you been hiding
behind my bed? - Four and a half hours.

77
00:03:13,646 --> 00:03:14,646
Good one!

78
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:17,769
You're stealthy, man. I always said
you should be a sniper!

79
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:19,744
I appreciate that, Dale!

80
00:03:22,795 --> 00:03:23,996
- I'm Rusty.
- Right.

81
00:03:24,116 --> 00:03:26,491
Here's what we do, get
lunch, take a tour of Appleby,

82
00:03:26,611 --> 00:03:28,046
then go to the chapel.

83
00:03:31,874 --> 00:03:33,876
Greek 2x09
<i>Three's is a crowd</i>

84
00:03:33,996 --> 00:03:35,885
Synchro : 7844, Coke.

85
00:03:36,045 --> 00:03:38,272
seriessub.com
sub-way.fr

86
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:42,767
Welcome everyone to our first
post-elections officers meeting.

87
00:03:43,786 --> 00:03:46,271
So, I know this past week was...

88
00:03:46,552 --> 00:03:48,912
... surprising for everyone.

89
00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:51,342
But it's time for all of us

90
00:03:51,462 --> 00:03:53,400
to look ahead as we transition

91
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,208
to our new regime.

92
00:03:55,328 --> 00:03:57,582
So in the spirit
of passing the torch,

93
00:03:57,702 --> 00:04:00,756
I'm proud to pass on
the presidential gavel

94
00:04:00,876 --> 00:04:03,871
to my best friend and fellow sister,

95
00:04:04,198 --> 00:04:05,415
Ashleigh Howard.

96
00:04:13,624 --> 00:04:14,506
Sorry,

97
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:15,811
sticky fingers.

98
00:04:16,484 --> 00:04:18,298
Anyway, your newly-elected

99
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:20,542
president will now
tell you what we,

100
00:04:21,044 --> 00:04:23,335
she, has coming this Friday.

101
00:04:27,306 --> 00:04:29,521
This Friday at 7:30,

102
00:04:29,682 --> 00:04:30,671
Casey...

103
00:04:31,153 --> 00:04:32,075
We...

104
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:35,569
have booked Dobler's for a night
of sister bonding

105
00:04:35,731 --> 00:04:37,363
and fun before the end of the year!

106
00:04:37,523 --> 00:04:38,572
Actually,

107
00:04:38,734 --> 00:04:40,950
since I'm the new social chair,
shouldn't I be the one

108
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:42,763
making that announcement?

109
00:04:43,503 --> 00:04:46,371
- Right, yes. I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

110
00:04:46,491 --> 00:04:47,957
Excuse me, point of order!

111
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,291
Yes, Laura?

112
00:04:52,674 --> 00:04:54,989
Shouldn't we look ahead
to next year's Rush

113
00:04:55,109 --> 00:04:56,451
instead of Dobler's?

114
00:04:56,571 --> 00:04:59,227
I mean, I get you were
social chair and all

115
00:04:59,347 --> 00:05:01,308
but what's going
on with fraternity Pref?

116
00:05:01,428 --> 00:05:03,473
Have the Omega Chis
asked us yet?

117
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:07,304
I don't think so.

118
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:08,728
Maybe?

119
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:14,442
The Omega Chis haven't officially
Pref'd us yet, that's true.

120
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,236
But,
I...

121
00:05:17,287 --> 00:05:18,702
we... she...

122
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,658
has no reason to believe
they won't.

123
00:05:21,818 --> 00:05:25,316
Who the Omega Chis pick for their first
mix is critical for us.

124
00:05:25,436 --> 00:05:27,835
It tells the incoming freshman
we're the best.

125
00:05:27,955 --> 00:05:30,683
Pref sets the social stage
for the entire year.

126
00:05:30,803 --> 00:05:34,426
If we don't begin Rush with the
number one fraternity on campus,

127
00:05:34,546 --> 00:05:37,483
we could be screwed socially.
We need this invite.

128
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,509
I don't mean to jump in, but

129
00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:41,669
it's a really simple solution.

130
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:44,421
I can talk to Evan and we'll
have that invite in no time.

131
00:05:45,591 --> 00:05:48,133
That won't be necessary,
Frannie. It's under control.

132
00:05:51,056 --> 00:05:52,020
Moving on.

133
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,395
Right.

134
00:05:54,515 --> 00:05:55,560
Moving on.

135
00:06:03,574 --> 00:06:04,686
OK, I got one.

136
00:06:05,996 --> 00:06:08,059
Helen Mirren or Judi Dench?

137
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:10,715
- Who would you rather?
- Helen Mirren is the obvious choice,

138
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:13,798
but Dame Judi won an Oscar
for 13 minutes of screen time.

139
00:06:13,996 --> 00:06:16,013
Imagine what she could
do to me in an hour.

140
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:17,724
- You gotta choose.
- When the choice

141
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,370
is that difficult, there's really
only one clear solution...

142
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,297
both.

143
00:06:21,586 --> 00:06:23,848
- You can't, it's against the rules.
- Come on.

144
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:26,282
I'd love to be a part of that
Queen Elizabeth sandwich.

145
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:28,401
C'mon, you know
you're a one-woman man.

146
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,628
I beg your pardon.

147
00:06:34,051 --> 00:06:35,326
It's no big deal.

148
00:06:35,446 --> 00:06:37,826
You've just kinda turned into
a serial monogamist.

149
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:39,821
Where'd you even learn that phrase?

150
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:40,777
Wikipedia.

151
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,320
It's not a big deal.

152
00:06:42,482 --> 00:06:44,282
So, you like to have one girlfriend.

153
00:06:44,443 --> 00:06:46,575
I also like to have sex
with hot chicks.

154
00:06:46,737 --> 00:06:48,932
Which I met
a few during Speed Dating.

155
00:06:49,052 --> 00:06:50,304
Speed dating?

156
00:06:51,376 --> 00:06:53,415
I went with Spitter
for moral support.

157
00:06:53,954 --> 00:06:56,585
{\Look, }Wade means that when people
call you a serial monogamist...

158
00:06:56,747 --> 00:06:58,838
Hold on! People call me that?

159
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:01,215
All the time.

160
00:07:01,376 --> 00:07:02,132
Really?

161
00:07:02,293 --> 00:07:04,593
This is worse than I thought.
Serial monogamist

162
00:07:04,755 --> 00:07:07,555
is just a stone's throw away
from being "the marrying kind."

163
00:07:07,836 --> 00:07:11,017
I need to re-establish my reputation
as the Titan of Tawdry.

164
00:07:11,887 --> 00:07:14,018
- I need a threesome.
- You can't just make

165
00:07:14,138 --> 00:07:15,570
a threesome happen.

166
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,185
Yes, I can.
And guess what? I will.

167
00:07:18,506 --> 00:07:21,193
This Saturday night.
But I'll need help from both of you.

168
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:25,431
Don't flatter yourselves.

169
00:07:25,993 --> 00:07:27,578
I've got the pepperoni.

170
00:07:28,676 --> 00:07:29,712
More'zah!

171
00:07:31,297 --> 00:07:33,362
Thursday's usually
our'zah day, Dale.

172
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:35,110
I totally forgot.

173
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,447
{\God, }I'm sorry. I figured you were
eating most of your meals

174
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:38,848
at the frat house by now.

175
00:07:38,968 --> 00:07:40,505
That'd be next year.

176
00:07:41,135 --> 00:07:42,720
You're in a fraternity?

177
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,093
Can you believe it?
Your buddy Dale has lived a year

178
00:07:45,213 --> 00:07:46,903
with a liberal fornicator.

179
00:07:47,023 --> 00:07:49,200
As opposed to the conservative kind?

180
00:07:54,235 --> 00:07:56,222
Why are there chess pieces
on my bed?

181
00:07:56,883 --> 00:07:59,731
I figure, since we're going our
separate ways,

182
00:07:59,851 --> 00:08:03,480
with you choosing to live in that petri
dish and me taking the high road...

183
00:08:04,522 --> 00:08:05,808
Kirk, you OK?

184
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:11,697
I figured we should divide up
the community property.

185
00:08:11,817 --> 00:08:13,140
Amicably, of course.

186
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,766
I just don't know how
to split up the chess board.

187
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:17,623
I don't know if we cut it in half,

188
00:08:17,743 --> 00:08:20,169
or just divide up
the red and black squares?

189
00:08:22,381 --> 00:08:24,968
I could hold onto it until next
year, so we could play then?

190
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,651
Fight me for custody of the board?

191
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:28,653
You're not gonna play it
at the frat house.

192
00:08:28,773 --> 00:08:30,525
They're more the Chutes
and Ladders crowd.

193
00:08:32,395 --> 00:08:33,808
I can actually taste

194
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,453
the fennel in the pepperoni.

195
00:08:38,343 --> 00:08:40,485
This pizza is fennelicious.

196
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,706
Fennelicious?

197
00:08:46,346 --> 00:08:47,743
That's funny, right?

198
00:08:48,117 --> 00:08:50,666
Kirk's always had
a very healthy appetite

199
00:08:50,786 --> 00:08:53,821
and quite a facility with language,
kind of like James Joyce,

200
00:08:54,352 --> 00:08:56,223
with the making up new words.

201
00:08:57,624 --> 00:08:58,736
And whatnot.

202
00:09:00,771 --> 00:09:02,209
It is fennelicious.

203
00:09:03,388 --> 00:09:04,212
See?

204
00:09:07,082 --> 00:09:10,369
So, a four-hour meeting
wasn't a good sign, right?

205
00:09:11,275 --> 00:09:13,173
The house is definitely divided

206
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:16,446
and the Frannie faction seems
intent on making your life hell.

207
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:17,681
So does Frannie.

208
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:19,770
She just can't give up.

209
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,185
I can ask Frannie for help
just this once, right?

210
00:09:24,305 --> 00:09:25,495
She's still a sister.

211
00:09:25,615 --> 00:09:27,555
No! She's ingratiating
herself again.

212
00:09:27,675 --> 00:09:29,196
She's using Evan as her weapon.

213
00:09:29,357 --> 00:09:32,657
{\The }1st rule of a good president is never
let someone else tell you what to do.

214
00:09:32,936 --> 00:09:34,098
That makes sense.

215
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,372
So here's what you're gonna do...

216
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:41,470
I'm just moving across campus

217
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,215
and Dale seems to think
I'm going to the moon.

218
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:46,587
And the guy he's
planning on replacing me with?

219
00:09:46,707 --> 00:09:50,153
"Kirk." Is it just me, or
is that a really stupid name?

220
00:09:50,577 --> 00:09:53,053
You can never tell
if he's saying Kirk or Kurt.

221
00:09:53,215 --> 00:09:54,263
So annoying.

222
00:09:54,424 --> 00:09:58,128
He also does this play-by-play
of every bite of food that he chews.

223
00:09:58,248 --> 00:10:01,768
He described his gum
as a minty fresh piece of paradise.

224
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,749
That's a little weird.

225
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:06,556
And Dale seems to think
he's the second coming.

226
00:10:06,676 --> 00:10:08,303
You know what he does for fun?

227
00:10:08,423 --> 00:10:10,058
He hides in weird places

228
00:10:10,178 --> 00:10:12,920
then he jumps out of them
to scare the crap out of Dale.

229
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,102
Last night, I got home,
I reached into my clothes hamper,

230
00:10:16,222 --> 00:10:17,502
and Kirk jumped out.

231
00:10:17,622 --> 00:10:20,407
He'd been hiding in there for an hour.
I almost had a heart attack.

232
00:10:20,527 --> 00:10:23,377
- Who does that?
- Apparently, the second coming?

233
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:25,775
- I'm serious.
- No, I'd say you're jealous.

234
00:10:25,895 --> 00:10:26,895
Of Dale?

235
00:10:27,016 --> 00:10:28,153
No, of Kirk.

236
00:10:28,273 --> 00:10:30,214
{\I mean, }You're upset
that Dale's replacing you.

237
00:10:30,334 --> 00:10:32,635
But you've replaced him
with an entire fraternity.

238
00:10:32,885 --> 00:10:35,190
No, I'm not moving out
for another two weeks,

239
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,133
and I'm not replacing anybody.

240
00:10:37,253 --> 00:10:40,065
Living in the house will not affect
my relationship with Dale.

241
00:10:40,185 --> 00:10:43,871
Once you become permanent at KT,
everything's supposed to stay the same?

242
00:10:43,991 --> 00:10:46,259
Come on, Rusty.
Circumstances change,

243
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,487
relationships change,
life changes.

244
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,857
You know, if you want to stay friends
with Dale, you gotta just suck it up

245
00:10:51,977 --> 00:10:53,977
and get used to Kurt.
- Kirk.

246
00:10:55,972 --> 00:10:59,208
Remember, keep it casual and only
between you, Evan and Dino.

247
00:10:59,328 --> 00:11:01,793
- What are you going to do?
- I'm just going to sit here

248
00:11:01,913 --> 00:11:03,436
in case you get in trouble.

249
00:11:03,585 --> 00:11:04,791
Sounds like a plan.

250
00:11:06,037 --> 00:11:07,253
Here they come.

251
00:11:09,907 --> 00:11:12,574
Good evening, gentlemen.
Thank you both for joining us.

252
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:16,178
Now, let's talk about Pref.

253
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,053
I'm gonna go grab a drink.

254
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,781
- Text me if you're in over your head.
- All right, thanks.

255
00:11:22,489 --> 00:11:24,519
You guys are all transitioned, huh?

256
00:11:25,499 --> 00:11:27,031
Some more than others.

257
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,067
Sorry to hear about your loss, Case.

258
00:11:30,228 --> 00:11:31,651
I mean, what an upset?

259
00:11:32,093 --> 00:11:33,528
I'm just here for support.

260
00:11:33,972 --> 00:11:37,561
So, Evan, I was wondering when we might
expect the Omega Chi Pref invite?

261
00:11:37,681 --> 00:11:40,069
Well, sorry to break it to you gals,

262
00:11:40,189 --> 00:11:43,089
but my brothers and I have decided
to, you know, shop around

263
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:45,139
a little before committing
this year.

264
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,770
It's nothing personal.

265
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,830
When do you think
you might come to a decision?

266
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,014
Because we're not going
to wait forever.

267
00:11:51,134 --> 00:11:52,819
We're shopping around, too.

268
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,386
- If you had to guess?
- It's hard to say when.

269
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:00,547
Come on, you guys Pref
with us every year.

270
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:02,909
Just cut to the chase,
set it, and move on.

271
00:12:03,742 --> 00:12:06,301
We've been getting a lot
of attention from other sorities.

272
00:12:06,421 --> 00:12:09,581
- Even though your girlfriend is a ZBZ?
- As presidents,

273
00:12:09,701 --> 00:12:11,368
we have to put the house first.

274
00:12:12,228 --> 00:12:13,540
That's right. I keep...

275
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,405
Sorry. I keep forgetting you're
no longer president, Case.

276
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:18,325
We're done here.

277
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:21,006
Or I'm done here.

278
00:12:22,022 --> 00:12:23,541
Ash, are we done here?

279
00:12:23,956 --> 00:12:24,956
No. I...

280
00:12:27,888 --> 00:12:30,106
OK, yeah, I guess
we're done here.

281
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,489
I can't believe we had to sit
in the first row.

282
00:12:39,609 --> 00:12:41,560
I don't think
my neck will ever recover.

283
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,304
I kinda liked it. It felt like we were
right there in the action.

284
00:12:44,424 --> 00:12:45,617
Thanks, Kirk!

285
00:12:45,737 --> 00:12:49,018
- Felt like we were inside the screen.
- I know. That's crazy, right?

286
00:12:49,138 --> 00:12:51,544
Darn it, I forgot
my cardigan. I'll be right back.

287
00:12:51,664 --> 00:12:53,093
Get me some more popcorn!

288
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:56,721
Dude, you gotta try this.
This is delicious,

289
00:12:56,841 --> 00:12:59,024
with artificial butter flavor,
the right amount of salt,

290
00:12:59,144 --> 00:13:00,783
and a bit of mustard just for fun.

291
00:13:00,943 --> 00:13:02,464
No one ever eats Titan popcorn.

292
00:13:02,584 --> 00:13:06,163
It's probably been sitting out
since 2001, the year.

293
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,831
Well, I, uh...

294
00:13:07,951 --> 00:13:10,322
I guess that's why
I came prepared.

295
00:13:12,441 --> 00:13:14,300
I'm totally baked right now.

296
00:13:15,686 --> 00:13:16,600
Baked?

297
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:19,124
But I'm actually
kind of running a little low.

298
00:13:19,244 --> 00:13:22,138
I was wondering if maybe you
could, you know, help me out?

299
00:13:22,425 --> 00:13:24,184
Help you out? With what?

300
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:27,393
Can you score me some herb?

301
00:13:27,871 --> 00:13:29,144
This popcorn sucks.

302
00:13:30,074 --> 00:13:31,471
Give me this.

303
00:13:31,591 --> 00:13:34,162
You probably didn't put
enough butter on it.

304
00:13:34,352 --> 00:13:36,224
He's so demanding
when he's hungry.

305
00:13:47,266 --> 00:13:48,397
Hey, uh, Dale.

306
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:51,351
My battery's dead. Can I borrow
your phone for a sec?

307
00:13:53,496 --> 00:13:56,350
How about a little
Trivial Pursuit, Bible Edition?

308
00:13:58,482 --> 00:14:01,709
"Eve in garden tempts man with apple
and lady parts." What book?

309
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:03,687
Maybe later.

310
00:14:04,862 --> 00:14:06,557
Genesis. It was Genesis.

311
00:14:13,975 --> 00:14:15,473
Who are you writing to?

312
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:16,845
My mom.

313
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,318
Cool.

314
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,535
How about a little Bible Boggle?

315
00:14:26,703 --> 00:14:28,745
Remember at Youth Group,
when you spelled Leviticus

316
00:14:28,907 --> 00:14:31,457
and Harvey Brubauer started crying?
{\Bud?!!!!!AtraduirepourlaVF}

317
00:14:45,054 --> 00:14:47,373
Dale, your pajamas
flew out the window.

318
00:14:47,841 --> 00:14:48,723
<i>What gives?</i>

319
00:14:50,132 --> 00:14:51,720
Must be the lightweight cotton.

320
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,823
You know, 'cause my winter flannels
never have that problem.

321
00:14:55,158 --> 00:14:57,149
All right. I'll be right back.

322
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:04,693
- What's wrong with you?
- C'mon!

323
00:15:04,944 --> 00:15:07,331
Considering you're in
a fraternity, I just

324
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:09,736
figured you'd be cool with it.

325
00:15:10,184 --> 00:15:13,068
Why don't you have this conversation
with your future roommate?

326
00:15:13,505 --> 00:15:14,542
Settle down,

327
00:15:14,797 --> 00:15:15,981
it's not like

328
00:15:16,101 --> 00:15:17,955
I'm Mr. Wake and Bake.

329
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:21,339
At least not every single day.
I just do it to relax.

330
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:24,467
{\And}It also comes in handy
with stale popcorn.

331
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:26,514
But you're Dale's
purity pledge brother.

332
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,007
But I'm on Rumspringa.

333
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:30,918
- Isn't that only for the Amish?
- Yes, technically.

334
00:15:31,038 --> 00:15:33,477
But I just think God
wanted me to take a break.

335
00:15:33,746 --> 00:15:36,159
You got kicked out of Bob Jones
University, didn't you?

336
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:38,524
Let's just say
we agreed to part company

337
00:15:38,826 --> 00:15:41,235
and the only way my parents
would send me to school again

338
00:15:41,396 --> 00:15:44,113
was if I agreed to come here,
room with Dale in the Dooby-Free Shop

339
00:15:44,274 --> 00:15:46,569
- You don't plan on telling him?
- Dale?

340
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,121
And you can't, either. I mean,

341
00:15:51,853 --> 00:15:53,629
Dale is not like us.

342
00:15:54,296 --> 00:15:56,926
OK, I mean,
he's a true believer.

343
00:15:58,478 --> 00:15:59,943
He can't handle the truth.

344
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,046
<i>Stop!</i>

345
00:16:02,207 --> 00:16:03,418
<i>Give them back!</i>

346
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:13,009
So why a 70s theme party?

347
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,285
No one here was alive
during the 70s.

348
00:16:15,405 --> 00:16:17,093
I wasn't even alive
during the 80s.

349
00:16:17,213 --> 00:16:18,213
Ah, youth.

350
00:16:18,483 --> 00:16:21,433
The 70s was when debauchery
was invented, Spitter.

351
00:16:21,712 --> 00:16:23,276
And tonight I plan to carry on

352
00:16:23,438 --> 00:16:25,210
in that same sordid tradition

353
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,213
by having myself a threesome.

354
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:30,349
Wait. Wasn't debauchery
invented in ancient Rome?

355
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,321
Actually,

356
00:16:32,441 --> 00:16:34,037
the modern concept of debauchery

357
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:37,207
defines its origins as the pagan
spring equinox of antiquity.

358
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:39,893
Wikipedia.

359
00:16:42,371 --> 00:16:45,820
- You're planning a threesome?
- You can't plan it. That's be sleazy.

360
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,037
It's best to create to create
a conducive world

361
00:16:48,157 --> 00:16:50,104
for the impromptum ménage à trois.

362
00:16:50,224 --> 00:16:53,069
It seems to me that anytime you have
three people involved in anything

363
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:55,470
someone's always left out
though, right?

364
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:58,817
There are worse things than being
the odd man out in a threesome.

365
00:17:00,098 --> 00:17:02,479
Yep, I'm definitely
in a fraternity house.

366
00:17:04,537 --> 00:17:06,137
Hypothetically speaking.

367
00:17:06,697 --> 00:17:08,405
Hey, Rus. You got a sec?

368
00:17:21,285 --> 00:17:23,531
I'm sorry,
I don't know how to start.

369
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:26,373
I usually talk to Ashleigh
about this kind of stuff

370
00:17:26,493 --> 00:17:28,582
and I know you're going to judge me.

371
00:17:29,023 --> 00:17:30,494
I don't always judge.

372
00:17:34,743 --> 00:17:36,266
I'm pissed at Ashleigh.

373
00:17:36,427 --> 00:17:37,726
Cause of the election?

374
00:17:38,294 --> 00:17:39,397
That's crazy.

375
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:41,187
It's not like she ran against you.

376
00:17:41,349 --> 00:17:42,893
- She's your best friend.
- I know!

377
00:17:43,015 --> 00:17:46,265
I know you're right. I lost.
She won. She's my best friend.

378
00:17:46,757 --> 00:17:50,357
But I've been working towards
this since my sophomore year.

379
00:17:50,628 --> 00:17:53,197
All the things I wanted
to do to make next year amazing.

380
00:17:53,317 --> 00:17:54,646
My last year.

381
00:17:54,892 --> 00:17:56,120
And now I can't.

382
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,244
'm jealous of my best friend

383
00:18:00,364 --> 00:18:01,428
and it sucks.

384
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:04,903
It's better than being jealous
of some random kid named Kirk.

385
00:18:06,396 --> 00:18:07,480
Who's Kurt?

386
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,164
Don't even get me started.

387
00:18:09,284 --> 00:18:11,224
{\He's } An old friend of Dale's
who's bad news.

388
00:18:11,344 --> 00:18:12,660
But if I tell Dale

389
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,492
I know it's gonna hurt him.

390
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:18,810
Like it might hurt Ashleigh if I
don't help her get through Pref.

391
00:18:20,198 --> 00:18:23,045
I mean, but it's for their own
good, for us to get involved.

392
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,817
We should always do
what's best for friends.

393
00:18:28,089 --> 00:18:30,747
Yes, even if it might appear
to favor us in some way.

394
00:18:36,888 --> 00:18:37,828
Good talk.

395
00:18:42,885 --> 00:18:45,881
So, how does it feel
to rule the world of Zeta Beta?

396
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,100
It sucks.

397
00:18:49,209 --> 00:18:52,470
I think I could be great, but
this was always Casey's thing.

398
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,289
And now that it's my thing,

399
00:18:54,651 --> 00:18:57,833
and I can't help but realize I don't
know what the hell I'm doing.

400
00:18:58,131 --> 00:19:00,463
You've gotta give yourself
some time to learn.

401
00:19:01,297 --> 00:19:04,823
It's hard to learn, though, when the
only person you ever go to for advice

402
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:06,709
wishes she was doing

403
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:08,942
what you're doing, or trying to do.

404
00:19:09,707 --> 00:19:11,579
She's obviously more qualified.

405
00:19:11,843 --> 00:19:14,064
You know, maybe it'd be
best for both of you

406
00:19:14,184 --> 00:19:16,120
if you didn't rely on Casey so much.

407
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,705
Just go with your gut.

408
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:20,440
Well, that's why I'm here.

409
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,576
I was hoping you'd do
what you did last time.

410
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:23,956
Talk to the guys,

411
00:19:24,076 --> 00:19:27,301
get them on our side about Pref
before any other sorities got involved.

412
00:19:27,421 --> 00:19:30,797
Every sorority is involved. They've
been courting us for the past week.

413
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:33,157
I wish I could talk
to Casey about this.

414
00:19:33,277 --> 00:19:37,173
Look, I know you're trying to be
sensitive to Casey's feelings and all,

415
00:19:37,293 --> 00:19:38,818
but you're president.

416
00:19:38,938 --> 00:19:41,892
That means you can't stand safely
behind in her shadow anymore.

417
00:19:42,012 --> 00:19:45,139
And that means you can't
take a backseat on any issue,

418
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:46,563
including Pref.

419
00:19:46,878 --> 00:19:49,690
You're gonna be the one held
responsible for what happens,

420
00:19:49,852 --> 00:19:52,441
so you've gotta be the one
who's driving the bus.

421
00:19:53,122 --> 00:19:54,122
All right?

422
00:19:58,327 --> 00:19:59,372
Where is he?

423
00:20:00,082 --> 00:20:01,025
Who, Kirk?

424
00:20:01,145 --> 00:20:03,203
He went to the bathroom
a while ago.

425
00:20:04,091 --> 00:20:07,403
He spends a lot {\more }time in there
han I remember. It may be a fiber issue.

426
00:20:09,645 --> 00:20:10,980
Last night after the movie,

427
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,006
Kirk asked me
to score him some herb.

428
00:20:13,322 --> 00:20:15,175
- Basil or tarragon?
- Weed.

429
00:20:15,336 --> 00:20:17,427
- Like dandelions?
- Marijuana.

430
00:20:17,588 --> 00:20:19,012
He's a serious pothead.

431
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,988
Come on. Good one, Rus.

432
00:20:22,413 --> 00:20:24,192
That's my BFF, man. I was there

433
00:20:24,312 --> 00:20:26,881
and watched him take
an oath in front of Pastor Chuck

434
00:20:27,233 --> 00:20:29,851
and the entire Baptist youth group

435
00:20:30,111 --> 00:20:31,921
to stay away from illegal
substances

436
00:20:32,102 --> 00:20:35,044
and corrupting influences
for all eternity, longer if necessary.

437
00:20:35,164 --> 00:20:36,196
Look at the signs.

438
00:20:36,357 --> 00:20:38,407
- He's always hungry.
- High metabolism.

439
00:20:38,568 --> 00:20:39,563
Bloodshot eyes?

440
00:20:39,683 --> 00:20:41,702
Allergies.
I told you, that's why he transferred!

441
00:20:41,863 --> 00:20:43,612
He mistook my slippers for bunnies.

442
00:20:43,732 --> 00:20:46,164
Rusty, they're bunny slippers.
It's an easy mistake.

443
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:49,251
All right, you know what,
Kirk is my best friend.

444
00:20:49,412 --> 00:20:51,879
And he's my pledge bro,
and he's my new roommate.

445
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,513
And next year we're going to have fun,
good wholesome fun,

446
00:20:54,633 --> 00:20:56,216
all year, in our room, together.

447
00:20:56,377 --> 00:20:58,151
- Come on, I'm not...
- {\No. }I don't have time.

448
00:20:58,337 --> 00:21:01,571
Cause Kirk is probably trapped
in the stall {\again, }and I have to go help him.

449
00:21:01,691 --> 00:21:04,274
Because that's what
friends do for each other.

450
00:21:09,249 --> 00:21:11,023
Jen F told me that the Gamma Mu's

451
00:21:11,143 --> 00:21:13,722
baked a gingerbread
replica of the Omega Chi house.

452
00:21:13,842 --> 00:21:15,496
And the Pi Delta Epsilons

453
00:21:16,105 --> 00:21:17,598
set up a bikini car wash.

454
00:21:17,718 --> 00:21:19,967
Are they still out there?
My car's pretty dirty.

455
00:21:20,118 --> 00:21:22,702
This is ridiculous.
Frannie should just talk to Evan.

456
00:21:22,822 --> 00:21:24,854
Hang on, guys. Everyone calm down.

457
00:21:24,974 --> 00:21:27,122
- I have a better idea.
- Hey Casey,

458
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:32,499
I've been thinking. And I've decided
we should just talk to Frannie.

459
00:21:32,677 --> 00:21:34,294
- I really...
- Don't worry.

460
00:21:34,414 --> 00:21:36,145
I have it covered. Trust me.

461
00:21:37,683 --> 00:21:38,841
All right, girls,

462
00:21:39,286 --> 00:21:40,843
it's time to get it on!

463
00:21:47,822 --> 00:21:50,338
Hey, everybody, we've got company.

464
00:21:50,573 --> 00:21:53,566
The sisters of ZBZ
invite all of the Omega Chis

465
00:21:53,686 --> 00:21:56,820
to a night of pleasure and pain
at Dobler's.

466
00:21:57,062 --> 00:21:58,790
The pleasure will be us.

467
00:21:59,648 --> 00:22:01,563
And the pain will be provided

468
00:22:01,683 --> 00:22:04,110
by that really big boxing

469
00:22:04,881 --> 00:22:07,663
pay-per-view
on a really, really big screen.

470
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,948
Looks like you have
another front-runner for Pref.

471
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:17,068
Great.

472
00:22:17,915 --> 00:22:20,759
Y'know, there are some things
I'm gonna miss about this.

473
00:22:23,727 --> 00:22:25,429
Hey, what's going on out there?

474
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:28,143
Ashleigh, or more likely Casey,

475
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,827
just gave us an offer
we can't refuse.

476
00:22:31,897 --> 00:22:33,600
I'm not surprised,

477
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:35,989
but I'm also sure you're gonna

478
00:22:36,109 --> 00:22:38,410
continue to hold off the brothers
until I make my move.

479
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,596
{\Well, }If I hold off
the Pref invite much longer,

480
00:22:40,716 --> 00:22:43,883
the guys may actually decide
to go with another house, and not ZBZ.

481
00:22:44,274 --> 00:22:47,149
The bikini car wash,
that was a huge hit.

482
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:50,497
Oh, please, the Gamma Psis are
almost as slutty as the Tri Pis.

483
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,313
Yeah, but I mean,

484
00:22:52,978 --> 00:22:55,419
only you and
Calvin see that as a downside

485
00:22:56,315 --> 00:22:58,880
Maybe we should Pref
with someone else.

486
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:01,089
{\I mean, }Casey would never
recover in the house from that.

487
00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:02,476
But neither would I.

488
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,227
OK, well, you know...

489
00:23:07,683 --> 00:23:09,975
I can make up an
excuse to make us late tonight,

490
00:23:10,136 --> 00:23:12,083
but I can't keep them away forever.

491
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:14,808
Trust me, Ashleigh will cave.

492
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,522
You sure you don't have any Chambers
blood coursing through those veins?

493
00:23:19,642 --> 00:23:20,689
Very sure.

494
00:23:25,962 --> 00:23:28,326
You know, I know almost
nothing about your family.

495
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:31,962
I'm not one to whine about
my tragic past.

496
00:23:32,265 --> 00:23:33,290
With anyone.

497
00:23:33,451 --> 00:23:35,595
I'm gonna go. I'll call you later.

498
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,521
- Hey, Wade.
- Hey, Rollergirl.

499
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:52,934
Far out.

500
00:23:57,365 --> 00:23:59,138
- I can dig it.
- All right.

501
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:05,799
Hey, Cappie. Hey, Rollergirl.

502
00:24:06,451 --> 00:24:08,867
So, where's this friend
you keep telling me about?

503
00:24:09,151 --> 00:24:11,395
I think you'll really
dig one another.

504
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,261
This is Cappie.

505
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,480
Excuse me one moment.

506
00:24:26,863 --> 00:24:28,929
So, I was thinking,
maybe if we just...

507
00:24:30,608 --> 00:24:33,304
I'll take that
as your third and final "no."

508
00:24:34,865 --> 00:24:36,961
I tried to warn him,
but he wouldn't listen.

509
00:24:37,081 --> 00:24:39,631
You know what, he deserves
the cheese weasel.

510
00:24:40,268 --> 00:24:42,810
- Did you just say "cheese weasel"?
- I'm moving on.

511
00:24:43,193 --> 00:24:45,299
Next year, I'm Dale-free.

512
00:24:45,949 --> 00:24:48,254
I'm just glad to be
getting out of there alive.

513
00:24:48,374 --> 00:24:50,872
So, uh, which one of these
rooms is gonna be yours?

514
00:24:51,126 --> 00:24:52,126
Here.

515
00:24:58,591 --> 00:25:00,417
Rusty, it's a pigsty.

516
00:25:00,654 --> 00:25:02,629
It's only messy
because it's Ferret's room.

517
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:05,048
- He's the house slob.
- Is Ferret human?

518
00:25:05,209 --> 00:25:07,379
Once he moves out,
I'll clean it up.

519
00:25:07,942 --> 00:25:09,444
It'll be good as new.

520
00:25:10,548 --> 00:25:13,480
Guys, I found something
we can put the extra beer in!

521
00:25:15,354 --> 00:25:18,019
<i>Stop it, Beav!</i>
<i>What are you doing,</i> <i>Beav?</i>

522
00:25:18,787 --> 00:25:20,999
And what does one have
to do to be labeled

523
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,774
the house slob of Kappa Tau?

524
00:25:25,138 --> 00:25:26,405
I said "freeway!"

525
00:25:29,192 --> 00:25:31,216
- Lisa Lawson!
- Cappie Cappie!

526
00:25:31,336 --> 00:25:33,270
Just the girl I'm looking for.
Really.

527
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,539
Do you by any random chance
happen to remember

528
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,687
a conversation
you and I had last year

529
00:25:37,807 --> 00:25:39,455
at the Cinco de Mayo party?

530
00:25:41,644 --> 00:25:43,708
I would love to have a threeway.

531
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:45,741
No better time than now.

532
00:25:45,861 --> 00:25:48,080
Meet me upstairs.
I'll find a ménage

533
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,224
for our trois.

534
00:25:54,367 --> 00:25:56,136
- Beverage?
- Thanks.

535
00:25:57,603 --> 00:25:58,839
You look far-out.

536
00:25:59,246 --> 00:26:00,508
I'll take that.

537
00:26:01,209 --> 00:26:02,884
So, how are things with you?

538
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:05,320
I'm OK. I'm single now.

539
00:26:05,738 --> 00:26:08,650
- Which is kinda how I like it.
- I totally know how you feel.

540
00:26:08,915 --> 00:26:11,198
So,{\ uh,} it's cool
if we're just friends?

541
00:26:11,358 --> 00:26:14,366
How about we're friends that go
to Gentleman's Choice together?

542
00:26:15,523 --> 00:26:16,572
{\Ah, }Good call.

543
00:26:16,692 --> 00:26:19,277
There's too many straight
horny people around here.

544
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:22,651
Great idea, huh?

545
00:26:27,507 --> 00:26:28,648
Nice costume.

546
00:26:28,768 --> 00:26:30,465
I'm not wearing a costume.

547
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,901
Dyn-o-mite!

548
00:26:40,022 --> 00:26:41,753
Dale? What are you doing here?

549
00:26:42,752 --> 00:26:45,713
{\Well, }You know, Kirk kind of sensed
that there was some tension between us,

550
00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:48,193
and, being
the peacemaker that he is,

551
00:26:48,354 --> 00:26:50,862
he insisted we come find you
and clear the air.

552
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,736
You know, he once brokered peace
between a Presbyterian and a Methodist.

553
00:26:54,856 --> 00:26:56,425
Hey, I wanna dance!

554
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,420
All right.

555
00:26:59,364 --> 00:27:01,914
See, he's so happy
that we're talking again

556
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,052
that he's dancing to evoke joy.

557
00:27:04,172 --> 00:27:06,604
And you know, it's like a fever.
It's catching on

558
00:27:06,724 --> 00:27:08,919
I don't know. I'm feeling it, too

559
00:27:09,136 --> 00:27:11,226
Let's all
just dance our anger away.

560
00:27:11,695 --> 00:27:13,154
You know? Right, Kirk?

561
00:27:17,173 --> 00:27:19,933
All right, is there anything
else you want to say to me?

562
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,188
Glad you came by.

563
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,207
Good, good.

564
00:27:28,071 --> 00:27:31,569
Good. {\, good, good.}{\Well, you know, }I'm probably gonna grab Kirk
and head back to the dorm, then.

565
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:34,493
We've got a big day tomorrow.
We're taking a tour of Benson Hall.

566
00:27:34,613 --> 00:27:37,051
Their salad bar has
garbanzo beans and pine nuts.

567
00:27:37,171 --> 00:27:39,258
He wants to sample both of them.

568
00:27:39,378 --> 00:27:41,770
You've seen his appetite.
I don't have to

569
00:27:42,108 --> 00:27:43,206
tell you.

570
00:27:50,381 --> 00:27:51,835
{\Um, }They're coming.

571
00:27:52,842 --> 00:27:56,089
In certain cultures,
like Spain or Los Angeles,

572
00:27:56,209 --> 00:27:58,256
20 minutes late is early.

573
00:27:58,444 --> 00:27:59,802
And we're in Ohio.

574
00:27:59,922 --> 00:28:02,475
Which is exactly why there's
nothing to worry about.

575
00:28:08,737 --> 00:28:10,855
Clearly this wasn't your idea, Ash.

576
00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:14,007
Did Evan say anything
to you about coming?

577
00:28:14,127 --> 00:28:15,071
I'm not sure.

578
00:28:15,191 --> 00:28:18,199
He did say some of the guys thought
the invite was kind of desperate.

579
00:28:19,819 --> 00:28:21,866
But whatever. It's not your fault.

580
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,035
You listened to Casey.
Are you sure you don't want me

581
00:28:25,241 --> 00:28:27,200
to at least call him? Text Evan?

582
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,168
Everything's handled, Frannie.

583
00:28:36,804 --> 00:28:39,304
Maybe we need to ask her...
Don't worry,

584
00:28:39,465 --> 00:28:41,264
the Omega Chis will show.

585
00:28:41,966 --> 00:28:43,823
Evan doesn't have that much power.

586
00:28:43,943 --> 00:28:44,794
See!

587
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:49,856
Just here for my shift.

588
00:28:53,764 --> 00:28:56,252
That's it, Case.
I gotta go with my gut. I'm just...

589
00:28:56,479 --> 00:28:58,823
gonna ask Frannie
to call Evan. It's fine.

590
00:28:58,984 --> 00:29:01,326
Don't open that door.
You've seen what she did to me.

591
00:29:01,487 --> 00:29:02,492
But I'm not you.

592
00:29:02,612 --> 00:29:04,702
Trust me, it's a really bad idea.

593
00:29:06,075 --> 00:29:07,290
As bad as this one?

594
00:29:08,569 --> 00:29:10,418
So, you're taking her side?

595
00:29:10,704 --> 00:29:12,128
I'm taking our side.

596
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:15,340
The house is tired of all the politics
and your fight with Frannie.

597
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,466
This is a sorority,
not the Middle East.

598
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:20,420
They just want peace and a Pref
invite from the Omega Chis.

599
00:29:20,823 --> 00:29:22,555
I'm trying to help you.

600
00:29:23,176 --> 00:29:24,413
And I'm president,

601
00:29:24,533 --> 00:29:26,644
and I'm making my first
executive decision.

602
00:29:43,924 --> 00:29:45,452
Are you sure you want to do this?

603
00:29:45,627 --> 00:29:47,826
I mean, a lot of guys
would be nervous with two girls.

604
00:29:47,946 --> 00:29:51,920
Trust me, that wouldn't even begin
to describe what I'm feeling right now.

605
00:29:52,653 --> 00:29:54,736
Lisa, I want you to meet
the third member...

606
00:29:54,856 --> 00:29:56,047
- You?
- You?

607
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:57,038
Me?

608
00:29:57,158 --> 00:29:59,283
Skank-monster stole
my boyfriend last year.

609
00:29:59,403 --> 00:30:01,926
I didn't steal him.
I just had sex with him.

610
00:30:02,046 --> 00:30:03,123
Girls,

611
00:30:03,497 --> 00:30:04,713
girls, come on.

612
00:30:05,801 --> 00:30:07,940
I think I speak for all
red-blooded males here

613
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,406
when I say
let's just kiss and make up.

614
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:13,051
This is too weird, Cap.

615
00:30:13,764 --> 00:30:14,764
Sorry.

616
00:30:16,962 --> 00:30:18,236
That's a mood killer.

617
00:30:18,534 --> 00:30:21,494
Actually, I really want
to get back at my ex.

618
00:30:21,993 --> 00:30:23,577
- I'm still in.
- Mood's back!

619
00:30:23,746 --> 00:30:25,631
My sister, Janette, is downstairs.

620
00:30:25,751 --> 00:30:27,406
- Sister?
- Sorority.

621
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,445
She's mentioned wanting
to do this before.

622
00:30:29,565 --> 00:30:32,041
- Thank God for sororities.
- I can get her.

623
00:30:32,767 --> 00:30:34,397
And risk losing you both?

624
00:30:34,517 --> 00:30:36,013
You stay right here.

625
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:37,964
- I'll go get Janet.
- Her name's Janette.

626
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:39,537
Whatever.

627
00:30:45,153 --> 00:30:47,354
Anyone seen a Gamma Psi
named Janet?

628
00:30:56,122 --> 00:30:58,818
Well, the smooth waltz
certainly has changed.

629
00:30:58,979 --> 00:31:01,244
It may be an Austrian version.

630
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:05,950
Yeah, those knee slaps.
That's definitely Viennese.

631
00:31:08,293 --> 00:31:11,077
What's the Hustle?
That's a dance, right?

632
00:31:11,533 --> 00:31:13,046
We should totally do that!

633
00:31:13,656 --> 00:31:15,710
You know what?
This is all your fault.

634
00:31:15,871 --> 00:31:17,380
Mine? What did I do?

635
00:31:17,881 --> 00:31:19,964
Five minutes
in your little den of iniquity

636
00:31:20,084 --> 00:31:22,038
and you've driven Kirk insane.

637
00:31:22,158 --> 00:31:23,805
Who wants chimichangas?

638
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:31,944
{\Oh, }That's smart. With all his dancing,

639
00:31:32,064 --> 00:31:34,508
he brought an electrolyte
infused sports drink

640
00:31:34,628 --> 00:31:36,670
- to stay quenched.
- Smell it.

641
00:31:39,227 --> 00:31:41,253
- It's rather pungent.
- It's tequila!

642
00:31:46,053 --> 00:31:48,753
You know, maybe one of
your KT bros planted it on him.

643
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:50,619
Dale, will you face the facts?

644
00:31:51,012 --> 00:31:52,163
Kirk is wasted.

645
00:31:52,324 --> 00:31:54,916
He drinks and he smokes pot
and God knows what else!

646
00:31:55,077 --> 00:31:57,460
- You're making up lies.
- You're completely blind.

647
00:31:57,621 --> 00:32:00,546
- You wanna take this outside, cowboy?
- We're already outside.

648
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:03,059
- Good.
- <i>Break it up, boys.</i>

649
00:32:04,085 --> 00:32:06,051
Is that an open container
of alcohol?

650
00:32:08,371 --> 00:32:11,306
It's OK. I'll handle this.
I'll handle this.

651
00:32:11,467 --> 00:32:12,761
- Kirk.
- Got it.

652
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,895
Let's see some Ids.

653
00:32:21,178 --> 00:32:23,693
You don't need to see their Ids.

654
00:32:34,904 --> 00:32:36,649
- Chrissy, I found Janet!
- Janette.

655
00:32:36,769 --> 00:32:37,902
Whatever.

656
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:40,795
- Hey, she... she's gone.
- Yes, but I'm not.

657
00:32:40,915 --> 00:32:42,936
No, but we should find Chrissy.

658
00:32:43,056 --> 00:32:45,434
Oh, she's probably just
grabbing a drink.

659
00:32:47,336 --> 00:32:50,346
Did you hear a knock on the door?
Was that us?

660
00:32:51,495 --> 00:32:52,816
Fine, you big baby.

661
00:32:52,936 --> 00:32:55,866
I'll find Chrissy and we'll do
your damn threesome.

662
00:32:56,395 --> 00:32:57,556
Thank you.

663
00:32:58,969 --> 00:33:02,400
Just come and knock on my door
when you get back.

664
00:33:09,345 --> 00:33:10,697
You know, Kirk,

665
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,788
I think we just gotta
look on the bright side here.

666
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:16,562
'Cause now you can get clean and
sober before school starts.

667
00:33:16,682 --> 00:33:20,238
We won't miss a day being roommates.
We'll never watch the E! Channel again.

668
00:33:20,358 --> 00:33:22,687
'Cause it is full of temptation.

669
00:33:22,807 --> 00:33:25,423
You know, with
all the aging trollops and,

670
00:33:26,534 --> 00:33:28,821
anyway, and then me
and the other PP brothers

671
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:31,140
can come down to rehab
over the summer,

672
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,499
next year we can all sing the praises
of restraint and abstinence together.

673
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:36,266
Dale! Dale! Stop! Stop!

674
00:33:36,386 --> 00:33:37,727
Don't you get it?

675
00:33:37,888 --> 00:33:38,978
I've changed.

676
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:43,123
I don't want to be
Mr. Goody-two-shoes anymore.

677
00:33:43,243 --> 00:33:46,277
I don't want to be your roommate
and I don't want to be your friend.

678
00:33:47,445 --> 00:33:49,304
I can manage my own friendships.

679
00:33:49,424 --> 00:33:51,741
I'm not trying to tell you
how to manage your friendships.

680
00:33:51,861 --> 00:33:54,410
I just want to tell this guy
that he's a douche and he's an idiot

681
00:33:54,571 --> 00:33:57,580
and you have no idea
who you're turning your back on.

682
00:33:58,271 --> 00:33:59,374
You don't!

683
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:14,349
Turnkey!

684
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:19,333
When're we getting sprung
from this godforsaken hellhole?

685
00:34:20,007 --> 00:34:21,148
Right now.

686
00:34:22,677 --> 00:34:24,899
Kettlewell and Cartwright?
You're clean and free to go.

687
00:34:29,204 --> 00:34:31,005
You have a stupid name.

688
00:34:42,076 --> 00:34:43,720
Well, the guys made it.

689
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:46,546
My lemon drop and I
are happy for you.

690
00:34:47,287 --> 00:34:48,797
I do wish you luck, however

691
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,470
Why?

692
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:53,638
We got the Omega Chis. All I had
to do was ask Frannie for a little help.

693
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,161
There's no asking Frannie
for a little anything.

694
00:34:56,437 --> 00:34:59,023
Case, it's time to make peace
and move on.

695
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,685
Wars aren't over when one side
stops fighting.

696
00:35:01,805 --> 00:35:03,300
Look around. Frannie's the hero.

697
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,392
{\Maybe }If she's feeling generous
she'll give you back

698
00:35:05,512 --> 00:35:07,400
the silver platter
you served us up on.

699
00:35:07,561 --> 00:35:09,629
So, now it's all my fault
Frannie's in charge?

700
00:35:09,749 --> 00:35:11,279
No, it's much worse than that.

701
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,366
Since we base our entire identity
as a house on the Omega Chis,

702
00:35:15,527 --> 00:35:19,412
it's our fault that the new president of
Zeta Beta Zeta is Evan Chambers.

703
00:35:26,287 --> 00:35:27,617
I'm going home.

704
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,051
Who's ready for round two?

705
00:35:54,065 --> 00:35:55,708
<i>Round two?</i>

706
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:04,790
What?

707
00:36:05,275 --> 00:36:08,209
We... We didn't... You, um...

708
00:36:08,955 --> 00:36:12,728
These two crazy girls hooked up
with Jeremy in our room last night.

709
00:36:13,356 --> 00:36:15,343
And every extra bed was taken.

710
00:36:15,504 --> 00:36:16,719
So we bunked here.

711
00:36:19,228 --> 00:36:21,194
Uncomfortable moment averted.

712
00:36:23,356 --> 00:36:25,536
- We didn't have round one, did we?
- No.

713
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:26,960
- Of course not.
- Never.

714
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,022
- Definitely not.
- Probably not.

715
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,044
Excellent.

716
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:40,312
Breakfast?

717
00:36:43,771 --> 00:36:45,065
Nice pajamas, Beav.

718
00:36:45,741 --> 00:36:48,822
Thank you.
They floated down from the sky.

719
00:36:49,313 --> 00:36:51,081
The cotton's really lightweight.

720
00:36:51,201 --> 00:36:52,713
Little itchy, though.

721
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,773
Hey Ashleigh,

722
00:36:57,211 --> 00:36:59,263
- I wanted to tell you that...
- Big news!

723
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,497
Evan just called,

724
00:37:00,617 --> 00:37:03,254
and the Omega Chis
are inviting us to Pref tonight.

725
00:37:03,374 --> 00:37:05,102
Looks like it worked, Frannie.

726
00:37:07,489 --> 00:37:10,214
Before we all get excited
about the Omega Chis,

727
00:37:10,334 --> 00:37:12,191
I've already asked the Lambda
Sigs to come by

728
00:37:12,352 --> 00:37:15,444
so we can accept
their invite to Fraternity Pref.

729
00:37:15,605 --> 00:37:17,738
The Lambda Sigs?
You've got to be kidding.

730
00:37:17,899 --> 00:37:20,116
They're the number two house
on campus.

731
00:37:20,593 --> 00:37:21,694
Sure, now.

732
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:24,186
But maybe by Preffing with us,
they'll become number one.

733
00:37:24,306 --> 00:37:25,955
Yeah, that's not how it works.

734
00:37:26,545 --> 00:37:28,416
The Omega Chis are number one.

735
00:37:29,496 --> 00:37:30,496
Really?

736
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:33,985
Well, not according
to a girlfriend of mine.

737
00:37:34,105 --> 00:37:36,391
See, my friend is the one
who dictates who's cool.

738
00:37:36,511 --> 00:37:37,675
What?

739
00:37:38,917 --> 00:37:40,677
Nope, it's not Casey.

740
00:37:41,515 --> 00:37:43,225
You see, this friend

741
00:37:43,696 --> 00:37:45,892
has never cared what
other people thought of her.

742
00:37:46,053 --> 00:37:47,425
And you know what?

743
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,093
Everyone fell
in love with her for it.

744
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,480
And she lived where?

745
00:37:51,856 --> 00:37:52,815
Fantasyland?

746
00:37:53,992 --> 00:37:56,363
I don't think Fantasyland
would've had her, Frannie.

747
00:37:56,872 --> 00:37:59,586
See, she spent years
with a vial of blood around her neck,

748
00:37:59,706 --> 00:38:01,898
and during the biggest night
of her life

749
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:04,035
she made out with her own brother.

750
00:38:04,196 --> 00:38:06,299
Great, OK, so she's a freak too.

751
00:38:06,419 --> 00:38:09,331
Why don't we rush her right
after we get done pairing up

752
00:38:09,451 --> 00:38:10,831
with the Lamda Sigs?

753
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:14,837
No, we're not going to rush her,

754
00:38:15,338 --> 00:38:16,392
because

755
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:19,357
she... is Angelina Jolie.

756
00:38:21,337 --> 00:38:23,549
Ashleigh's friend
with Angelina Jolie?

757
00:38:24,151 --> 00:38:26,919
No, I think she's an analogy.

758
00:38:28,799 --> 00:38:30,490
I thought she was an actress.

759
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:32,986
See, after Angelina
ditched Billy Bob,

760
00:38:33,106 --> 00:38:35,733
she stopped letting guys
define her.

761
00:38:35,894 --> 00:38:37,401
She got cool, all on her own.

762
00:38:37,562 --> 00:38:39,835
And it's not because
she's with Brad Pitt.

763
00:38:39,955 --> 00:38:42,073
Even though it doesn't hurt.

764
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:46,577
The fact is, we can be
like Angelina.

765
00:38:46,738 --> 00:38:48,908
We can be unique and cool

766
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:52,019
and crazy and weird and generous

767
00:38:52,743 --> 00:38:55,753
and totally gorgeous too.

768
00:38:55,914 --> 00:38:59,757
Ashleigh, now's not exactly
the time for an us Weeklyrecap.

769
00:39:00,477 --> 00:39:01,644
I want to know...

770
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:04,470
why we're letting
a bunch of guys define us?

771
00:39:05,714 --> 00:39:08,047
We'll choose what's awesome
and who's cool

772
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:10,267
and we'll choose who's number one.

773
00:39:10,428 --> 00:39:11,894
We can have it all,

774
00:39:12,055 --> 00:39:15,145
because
we can be Angelina Jolie, too!

775
00:39:32,517 --> 00:39:35,769
<i>Brothers in our garden true</i>

776
00:39:35,889 --> 00:39:39,437
<i>Forever in unity</i>

777
00:39:39,975 --> 00:39:42,282
<i>Omega Chi, here we are</i>

778
00:39:42,402 --> 00:39:43,661
Hello, guys, hi.

779
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:46,225
I'm Betsy, for those of you
who don't know me.

780
00:39:46,345 --> 00:39:47,722
I'm the new social chair.

781
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:49,441
<i>Hi, Betsy.</i>

782
00:39:49,967 --> 00:39:53,432
So, we really appreciate your
invitation to Pref next year.

783
00:39:53,552 --> 00:39:57,064
But we've voted and
we're going to turn you down.

784
00:39:58,642 --> 00:40:01,928
Oh, and it's because
of Angelina Jolie.

785
00:40:02,771 --> 00:40:04,955
Angelina Jolie is a ZBZ?

786
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:16,045
Dale, wait.

787
00:40:16,878 --> 00:40:18,295
Why won't you talk to me?

788
00:40:18,415 --> 00:40:20,575
I'm getting used
to the sound of my own company.

789
00:40:20,695 --> 00:40:22,349
- Come on. Seriously.
- No,

790
00:40:22,469 --> 00:40:25,157
'cause you were right about Kirk.
I didn't want to see it.

791
00:40:25,277 --> 00:40:26,677
You were right, too.

792
00:40:27,522 --> 00:40:29,474
I didn't {\want to }think anything
would be different

793
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,310
when we're not roommates anymore.

794
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,726
But it will be.
Yeah, I know, hence my embrace

795
00:40:33,887 --> 00:40:36,353
of solitude and reinforcement
of personal space.

796
00:40:36,514 --> 00:40:38,240
I'm not going to disappear,

797
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,524
or turn into a drug addict.

798
00:40:42,303 --> 00:40:43,944
You still up for
a trip to that roof?

799
00:40:44,104 --> 00:40:46,166
What about your respect
for law and country?

800
00:40:46,286 --> 00:40:48,687
Come on, man,
we've already done hard time.

801
00:40:48,807 --> 00:40:50,844
What's the worst
that can happen now, huh?

802
00:41:00,871 --> 00:41:03,068
I was just thinking the same thing.

803
00:41:05,927 --> 00:41:07,791
- We should do something.
- Yeah.

804
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:10,530
- Something dramatic.
- OK, OK.

805
00:41:11,909 --> 00:41:13,735
Let's sing the school fight song.

806
00:41:14,696 --> 00:41:15,987
All right. You ready?

807
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:17,686
Two, three, four.

808
00:41:17,847 --> 00:41:20,912
<i>Far above the hills</i>

809
00:41:21,032 --> 00:41:22,470
<i>and valleys...</i>

810
00:41:23,812 --> 00:41:24,884
What are you doing?

811
00:41:25,004 --> 00:41:27,363
These look like hills?
These are mountains.

812
00:41:28,436 --> 00:41:30,872
We should put
"learn the CRU fight song"

813
00:41:30,992 --> 00:41:33,315
on our list of things to do
before we move out.

814
00:41:35,604 --> 00:41:36,798
Let's just...

815
00:41:38,336 --> 00:41:41,426
let's just put it on our list of things
to do together next year.

816
00:41:54,684 --> 00:41:56,861
Let me get that, Madame President.

817
00:42:00,178 --> 00:42:02,294
I'd feel better
if we'd won the decision

818
00:42:02,414 --> 00:42:06,006
to turn down the Omega Chis
by more than three votes.

819
00:42:06,578 --> 00:42:08,571
Well, you won the presidency
by one vote.

820
00:42:08,732 --> 00:42:11,947
Now you're up by three.
It just means you're making progress.

821
00:42:13,049 --> 00:42:16,245
It's going to be a little scary, not
being able to rely on the Omega Chis.

822
00:42:17,443 --> 00:42:19,520
Ash, you're my president.

823
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,397
And my best friend. I want to help.

824
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:25,566
Sometime's it's hard

825
00:42:25,686 --> 00:42:27,923
when things change
and you don't want them to.

826
00:42:29,693 --> 00:42:31,135
But you're OK with it?

827
00:42:32,046 --> 00:42:33,526
More than I was last week.

828
00:42:33,924 --> 00:42:35,522
It's going to take a little time.

829
00:42:35,642 --> 00:42:38,601
But I promise
I'll be OK. Eventually.

830
00:42:48,383 --> 00:42:49,674
Calvin Owens!

831
00:42:50,127 --> 00:42:51,889
Hell Week, buddy. Let's go.

832
00:42:53,712 --> 00:42:55,312
Awkward. Come on, let's go,

833
00:42:55,432 --> 00:42:57,594
let's go. <i>Get up, Calvin, let's go!</i>

834
00:42:58,034 --> 00:42:59,237
<i>Come on!</i>

835
00:43:06,634 --> 00:43:07,796
Kirk? Is that you?

836
00:43:09,384 --> 00:43:11,091
Two things, Pledge. First of all,

837
00:43:11,958 --> 00:43:14,996
when you're wearing pantyhose
on your head, never wear control top.

838
00:43:15,116 --> 00:43:18,265
Second of all, welcome
to Hell Week. Your ass is mine!

839
00:43:18,426 --> 00:43:19,770
Get him out of here

840
00:43:24,737 --> 00:43:25,737
Hey, Chip.

841
00:43:26,287 --> 00:43:27,287
Hey, Dale.
