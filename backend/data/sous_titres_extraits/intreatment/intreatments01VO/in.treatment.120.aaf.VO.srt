<i>Previously, on</i> In Treatment...

2
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:12,589
You said that ending the therapy
was the best good solution.

3
00:00:12,852 --> 00:00:15,384
I said it might be necessary
for her sake.

4
00:00:15,646 --> 00:00:19,651
When you say "good solution," I think
you mean a solution to your problems.

5
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:22,486
Alex, the fighter pilot, met Laura.

6
00:00:22,646 --> 00:00:26,646
So he comes back the next afternoon,
tells me that they met and now...

7
00:00:28,148 --> 00:00:29,798
And now they're dating.

8
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:32,651
You want me to talk about Laura?

9
00:00:32,913 --> 00:00:36,113
What do you want me to say? That I sit
opposite her and say, "What if?"

10
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:38,741
Well, I do.

11
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,229
Sorry I'm late. I was...

12
00:00:54,743 --> 00:00:56,526
I was at the market.

13
00:00:56,686 --> 00:00:59,954
Listen, would you mind putting these
in the fridge for me, please?

14
00:01:00,114 --> 00:01:01,253
Fish heads.

15
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,800
They're fish heads?

16
00:01:05,096 --> 00:01:07,002
Yeah, I'm making some chowder.

17
00:01:08,742 --> 00:01:11,197
- Fish heads for... yeah.
- Thanks.

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,027

www.swsub.com

21
00:01:35,627 --> 00:01:37,007
I really like your dress.

22
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,828
Thank you.

23
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:43,389
And your hair looks different.

24
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:48,727
- You look great, Gina.
- That's good of you to say that.

25
00:01:49,949 --> 00:01:52,439
Makes you look,
I don't know, softer somehow.

26
00:01:53,574 --> 00:01:54,924
Special occasion?

27
00:01:55,576 --> 00:01:57,426
Softer? That's interesting.

28
00:01:58,764 --> 00:02:01,598
- I'm going out with friends.
- Let me guess,

29
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:03,367
bunch of shrinks?

30
00:02:04,422 --> 00:02:07,913
Yes and I'm gonna tell them that
you brought me two bags of fish heads.

31
00:02:09,277 --> 00:02:11,308
Yes, most of them are shrinks.

32
00:02:12,213 --> 00:02:14,541
And the non-shrinks will think

33
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,851
you're analyzing them,
which, of course, you will be.

34
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:23,080
Do you know who's been
on my mind lately?

35
00:02:24,615 --> 00:02:25,513
Doris.

36
00:02:26,077 --> 00:02:27,641
From the institute?

37
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:30,060
- Are you in touch?
- Well, sort of.

38
00:02:30,322 --> 00:02:32,472
She's just gotten divorced again.

39
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:36,978
She left this dentist
who was a chronic cheat

40
00:02:37,138 --> 00:02:40,470
and now she's with this whiny,
sourpuss doctor.

41
00:02:40,976 --> 00:02:43,448
Such an obvious reaction.
You'd think as a shrink,

42
00:02:43,608 --> 00:02:45,778
you'd be able to avoid
that kind of thing.

43
00:02:45,938 --> 00:02:48,134
Easier to see patterns
when they're not ours.

44
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:50,788
Or we see them
but we can't avoid them.

45
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,493
That's worse.

46
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:56,261
You know...

47
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:58,437
Doris had a...

48
00:02:58,784 --> 00:03:01,216
She had a bit of a thing for me
back in the day.

49
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,577
Did she?

50
00:03:02,737 --> 00:03:05,273
She used to say
she was crazy about me.

51
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,470
But I never slept with her.
I always had this feeling

52
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,536
that if I did, she'd somehow,

53
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:14,689
I don't know,
use it against me or...

54
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:18,442
- say I was using her or something.
- She was like that. Extremes.

55
00:03:18,705 --> 00:03:19,568
But hot.

56
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,951
Not such useful qualities
for a therapist.

57
00:03:23,751 --> 00:03:26,416
You don't think
anybody's a good therapist.

58
00:03:26,576 --> 00:03:28,526
I'm no good either, remember?

59
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:31,679
Isn't that how we left off?

60
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,377
- Should we talk about our last session?
- Should we? I don't know.

61
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:41,677
I will say that it's not the first time
I've left here disappointed or angry.

62
00:03:41,837 --> 00:03:44,035
If I was you, I'd look into that.

63
00:03:45,823 --> 00:03:48,013
Of course, I'm angry
at everything these days.

64
00:03:48,275 --> 00:03:51,640
More or less all the time.
This week was particularly...

65
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:56,188
- What?
- The girl gymnast...

66
00:03:58,201 --> 00:04:01,815
Took a bunch of pills
and collapsed in my office.

67
00:04:02,522 --> 00:04:05,030
- Pills to get high?
- No, sleeping pills.

68
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:07,658
Tried to do herself in.
Attempted suicide.

69
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,086
- God, Paul.
- Well, sort of.

70
00:04:11,298 --> 00:04:12,848
Choosing my office...

71
00:04:13,724 --> 00:04:16,732
There are more efficient places
to kill yourself, I must say.

72
00:04:16,892 --> 00:04:18,842
But she was acting out and...

73
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,547
Got to say it rattled me.

74
00:04:21,809 --> 00:04:26,050
- She took the pills before the session?
- I had them, really stupidly...

75
00:04:26,563 --> 00:04:28,668
I never have pills in my bathroom.

76
00:04:28,828 --> 00:04:32,378
But I'm sleeping on the couch
so I'd brought some stuff down.

77
00:04:33,456 --> 00:04:35,853
She managed to get down
most of the bottle.

78
00:04:37,201 --> 00:04:38,951
- Is she okay?
- She is.

79
00:04:39,952 --> 00:04:42,918
I called the psychiatrist
who's a friend of mine

80
00:04:43,078 --> 00:04:44,395
and I asked him

81
00:04:44,987 --> 00:04:46,808
not to have her committed.

82
00:04:48,514 --> 00:04:50,764
Do you feel pretty sure she's safe?

83
00:04:52,261 --> 00:04:53,900
I think she would've been crushed

84
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,416
if she thought
that I'd abandoned her...

85
00:04:56,576 --> 00:05:00,043
You know, the parental figure
passing her on to somebody else.

86
00:05:00,203 --> 00:05:02,909
I have a feeling that's why
she took the pills in the first place,

87
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,301
to kind of test my...

88
00:05:05,802 --> 00:05:07,885
My commitment to her.

89
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,293
- Are you feeling guilty?
- No,

90
00:05:12,391 --> 00:05:14,241
but I do regret those pills.

91
00:05:15,462 --> 00:05:17,540
Well, there's always a way
to kill yourself.

92
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,990
True. No I don't feel responsible.

93
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:22,401
The strange thing is

94
00:05:22,578 --> 00:05:25,240
we had been making
a lot of progress lately.

95
00:05:25,514 --> 00:05:27,728
She told me that she'd had sex
with this boy

96
00:05:27,888 --> 00:05:31,538
and he told her that she fucked
like somebody who'd been abused.

97
00:05:33,554 --> 00:05:36,227
Amazingly insensitive dumb kid

98
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:39,615
trying to cover his own insecurity,
but Christ, it made me so angry.

99
00:05:41,078 --> 00:05:43,185
Normally, I never say anything.

100
00:05:43,573 --> 00:05:46,041
- But you did?
- I did. I called him an idiot.

101
00:05:46,201 --> 00:05:47,551
How did she react?

102
00:05:48,077 --> 00:05:50,527
If she heard,
she didn't acknowledge it.

103
00:05:52,893 --> 00:05:55,043
But a moment later she had this...

104
00:05:55,576 --> 00:05:56,725
major breakthrough.

105
00:05:57,767 --> 00:06:00,228
She started to remember details
of the accident.

106
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,418
I mean, it was a crucial
therapeutic breakthrough.

107
00:06:03,578 --> 00:06:05,979
I felt we were
really getting somewhere.

108
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:08,889
Then she just upped
and went to the bathroom.

109
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:17,854
You think you're more effective
when you're involved?

110
00:06:18,014 --> 00:06:20,372
When you show a patient
your feelings?

111
00:06:20,765 --> 00:06:22,915
Maybe, I don't know.
But that's not what I'm...

112
00:06:23,075 --> 00:06:25,225
- really saying here, Gina.
- No?

113
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:28,291
Would you stop drawing conclusions?

114
00:06:28,451 --> 00:06:30,403
I'm just telling you about my week.

115
00:06:32,376 --> 00:06:33,414
Let's see...

116
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,043
In other news...

117
00:06:36,967 --> 00:06:39,977
Kate took her affair to Rome
this week.

118
00:06:42,991 --> 00:06:46,805
When Sophie collapsed in my office,
I yelled out for Kate,

119
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:51,625
then realized I was alone in the house.
I was the only one there.

120
00:06:53,874 --> 00:06:56,024
Did you and Kate discuss anything?

121
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:59,101
She didn't try to get me
to stop her.

122
00:07:01,437 --> 00:07:03,481
She just made a call to work,

123
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:06,295
and packed her bag and off she went.

124
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,325
- You weren't surprised?
- Not really.

125
00:07:10,018 --> 00:07:12,268
That's the way Kate has always been.

126
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:16,842
I mean that was one of the things
I fell in love with...

127
00:07:17,002 --> 00:07:20,552
The fact that she just made up her mind
and just did whatever

128
00:07:22,531 --> 00:07:24,281
she was determined to do.

129
00:07:25,936 --> 00:07:28,589
So unlike my mother, you know?

130
00:07:29,944 --> 00:07:32,846
I think one of the reasons I married her
was to get back at my mother,

131
00:07:33,006 --> 00:07:36,693
because it was some kind of strike
against that whole notion of...

132
00:07:37,535 --> 00:07:39,193
I don't know, victimhood.

133
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:43,988
One thing you can say about Kate
is she never played the victim.

134
00:07:44,148 --> 00:07:47,377
She makes up her mind
to go to Rome, she goes to Rome.

135
00:07:52,253 --> 00:07:55,503
It's been 18 years
since I've been alone in that house.

136
00:07:56,128 --> 00:07:57,978
Rosie's away for the weekend

137
00:07:59,255 --> 00:08:01,402
and Max is with Kate's mom.

138
00:08:04,062 --> 00:08:06,327
I've got the whole house to myself.

139
00:08:08,068 --> 00:08:10,317
- How is that?
- Weird.

140
00:08:13,753 --> 00:08:15,704
Anyway, I'm hoping with...

141
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,867
With my fish chowder and a bottle
of good wine, I'll get lucky.

142
00:08:21,192 --> 00:08:24,942
You think I'm joking but I do make
a mean chowder, I have to say.

143
00:08:25,878 --> 00:08:28,971
I start with the broth
then the vegetables and the fillets.

144
00:08:29,131 --> 00:08:31,088
I steam the leeks and the carrots,

145
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:36,422
a few other things. Mix them all
together, leave it for about 20 min.

146
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:38,805
Delicious.

147
00:08:39,528 --> 00:08:41,223
The smell always made Kate sick.

148
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,293
She could never stand it.

149
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:46,907
I have to say I love it.

150
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,619
- Do you like chowder?
- I do.

151
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:53,860
Well, maybe I'll have a little party,
invite a couple of people over.

152
00:08:54,122 --> 00:08:56,881
I could invite...
I could invite Doris.

153
00:08:58,252 --> 00:09:00,602
How long is it since you've seen her?

154
00:09:04,066 --> 00:09:07,216
The carefree days of the institute.
The good old days.

155
00:09:08,186 --> 00:09:11,174
- Would you invite her husband?
- Are you kidding?

156
00:09:12,132 --> 00:09:15,296
It'll say in the invite,
"No sourpusses, please."

157
00:09:15,927 --> 00:09:18,093
- Just Doris Messler and you.
- And you.

158
00:09:19,743 --> 00:09:20,800
I'm invited?

159
00:09:21,176 --> 00:09:23,534
You can wear that dress if you want.

160
00:09:23,694 --> 00:09:26,434
Oh, well, thank you,
but I think I'd just be in the way.

161
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:30,253
No, you wouldn't.
You're my cover. That's the whole point.

162
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,518
I'll tell her you're coming, how great
it would be if she came too.

163
00:09:33,678 --> 00:09:36,344
It would be like an institute
reunion.

164
00:09:37,941 --> 00:09:40,407
And then I leave
and you're alone with her.

165
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:43,117
Perfect. It's a perfect plan.
Can't fail.

166
00:09:44,507 --> 00:09:46,914
You're in a chipper mood,
considering.

167
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:49,319
Guess I am.

168
00:09:50,817 --> 00:09:52,210
It's nice for a change.

169
00:09:53,065 --> 00:09:54,589
I miss this side of you.

170
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:58,278
I guess it's 'cause this shitty week
is finally over.

171
00:09:58,752 --> 00:10:00,845
You're also showing me something.

172
00:10:01,005 --> 00:10:02,471
What am I showing you?

173
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:06,810
How it feels to be with Laura.

174
00:10:08,445 --> 00:10:10,918
How a therapist feels when...

175
00:10:11,587 --> 00:10:13,191
a patient is flirting.

176
00:10:14,774 --> 00:10:16,536
You think I'm flirting with you?

177
00:10:16,696 --> 00:10:18,006
Well, no.

178
00:10:18,456 --> 00:10:22,222
That's the wrong word.
It's not flirting, it's...

179
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:24,743
I'm your cover but...

180
00:10:26,063 --> 00:10:28,142
You're inviting me to a party

181
00:10:28,302 --> 00:10:30,596
and you're telling me
which dress to wear

182
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:33,106
and you're inviting me
into your life.

183
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:35,330
And it maybe is a taste of...

184
00:10:35,943 --> 00:10:37,893
Of what it's like with Laura.

185
00:10:38,824 --> 00:10:40,592
You know, she draws you in.

186
00:10:43,318 --> 00:10:44,868
It must be flattering.

187
00:10:48,443 --> 00:10:49,606
Yeah it is.

188
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,770
I gotta tell you,
she's one hell of a storyteller.

189
00:10:54,261 --> 00:10:56,046
Man, can she weave a tale.

190
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:03,115
She goes into explicit, vivid detail.

191
00:11:04,887 --> 00:11:08,036
She spent about a half an hour
telling me about the...

192
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:12,499
About the sex
that she had with Alex...

193
00:11:13,751 --> 00:11:16,095
What she liked,
what she didn't like,

194
00:11:16,255 --> 00:11:20,053
what he liked, what she did,
what he did.

195
00:11:23,005 --> 00:11:24,155
Pretty vivid.

196
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,524
A man would have
to be made of rock not to react,

197
00:11:30,506 --> 00:11:32,156
not to feel a little...

198
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,793
- A little what?
- Jealous.

199
00:11:39,755 --> 00:11:41,319
Of course, that's what she wanted.

200
00:11:42,382 --> 00:11:43,382
Was it?

201
00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:47,158
I know you think it's a problem

202
00:11:47,318 --> 00:11:50,746
that I have this jealousy
over Laura's affair with Alex.

203
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:54,500
- No, not necessarily.
- Jealousy is not on your list

204
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,978
of reactions a therapist should have.
Or is it a list of no-no feelings?

205
00:11:59,242 --> 00:12:01,509
Is that what you want
from me, a list?

206
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:03,199
Would that make it easier?

207
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:04,344
I doubt it.

208
00:12:04,504 --> 00:12:06,595
You keep putting words in my mouth.

209
00:12:06,857 --> 00:12:10,814
Maybe you want me to be unreasonable
so you have something to push against.

210
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:12,494
This topic...

211
00:12:12,754 --> 00:12:16,404
This topic always brings us back
onto shaky ground, doesn't it?

212
00:12:16,564 --> 00:12:17,487
What topic?

213
00:12:17,647 --> 00:12:19,899
The boundaries
between therapist and patient.

214
00:12:20,316 --> 00:12:23,208
Teachers marry students.
There's no big deal about it.

215
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,453
What's the...
I mean, is it really wrong?

216
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:27,384
It's different, Paul.

217
00:12:29,944 --> 00:12:32,865
I remember Charlie, your...

218
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,383
Your patient.

219
00:12:35,543 --> 00:12:38,284
He used to call me
after sessions and he'd say,

220
00:12:38,444 --> 00:12:41,595
"This no-sex-with-the-therapist thing,
it's driving me crazy.

221
00:12:41,755 --> 00:12:44,290
"Is it for real?
There's got to be a loophole.

222
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,304
"Am I never going
to get to sleep with Gina?"

223
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,030
Okay.
Let's stay I stop Laura's therapy.

224
00:12:51,196 --> 00:12:54,096
Let's say I send her to somebody else
as you want me to do.

225
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:57,597
Surely, in six months time
I can call her up and say...

226
00:12:57,757 --> 00:12:59,381
No, no you can't.

227
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,941
Then a year, 18 months,
when it's cooled off.

228
00:13:02,203 --> 00:13:03,902
There's no cooling-off period.

229
00:13:04,524 --> 00:13:06,541
It's not about cooling off.

230
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,783
It doesn't change the dynamic.

231
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,960
In six months or 10 years,
she'll still be a patient.

232
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,831
But that's just some bullshit
some lawyer came up with.

233
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:17,644
No, it's not a law.

234
00:13:17,804 --> 00:13:20,293
It's beyond a code of ethics.
It's essential.

235
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:23,631
It's something you carry inside you.

236
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:26,066
Can't you see that?

237
00:13:27,819 --> 00:13:30,713
So what you're saying is that
there is no conceivable

238
00:13:30,873 --> 00:13:33,340
- set of circumstances in which...
- None.

239
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,600
Christ,
you're so fucking fundamentalist.

240
00:13:36,493 --> 00:13:38,844
There's a lot of people
who would disagree with this.

241
00:13:39,004 --> 00:13:40,254
Then go to them.

242
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:50,269
She's 30 years old.

243
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:54,370
She's seductive,
dependent, hysterical.

244
00:13:55,453 --> 00:13:58,647
She idolizes you.
It's classic, right? It's textbook.

245
00:14:00,228 --> 00:14:02,219
Here's a girl
with damaged self-esteem...

246
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:04,587
Excuse me,
how do you know she's damaged?

247
00:14:04,849 --> 00:14:08,099
You've told me about her affair
with your other patient,

248
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:10,271
her trying to make you jealous,

249
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,316
her describing the sex,

250
00:14:14,317 --> 00:14:16,567
how she's tried
to enter your house,

251
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:19,278
how she's played all of these games

252
00:14:19,438 --> 00:14:22,491
to try to get an oedipal reaction
from you.

253
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:26,391
If you fall for these advances,
she won't be grateful.

254
00:14:26,551 --> 00:14:28,446
She'll be shocked, rightly so.

255
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,938
And she'll leave you.

256
00:14:35,255 --> 00:14:38,931
All of which you know,
but you're ignoring it.

257
00:14:41,258 --> 00:14:42,584
You want to be desired.

258
00:14:44,943 --> 00:14:45,837
We all do.

259
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:51,342
But you need to remember why
Laura came to you in the first place.

260
00:14:51,603 --> 00:14:54,784
So you're telling me now
what's wrong with my patient?

261
00:14:55,253 --> 00:14:57,974
Another dissertation
on what a lousy therapist I am?

262
00:14:58,236 --> 00:15:01,036
I have never,
ever said anything like that.

263
00:15:01,196 --> 00:15:02,312
Excuse me?

264
00:15:02,574 --> 00:15:05,471
What about that famous letter
you wrote?

265
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:08,381
I carried that letter
in my pocket for months.

266
00:15:10,321 --> 00:15:13,346
But I do have to say that everything
I've accomplished as a therapist,

267
00:15:13,506 --> 00:15:15,492
I owe to that letter.
So, thank you.

268
00:15:16,943 --> 00:15:19,410
You know, we're getting away
from Laura again.

269
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,593
I can quote it.

270
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,848
"The patients
were consistently positive

271
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:27,932
"about their sessions with Paul.

272
00:15:28,381 --> 00:15:31,782
"However, it became clear that Paul
was playing to their expectations.

273
00:15:31,942 --> 00:15:34,177
"His approach to therapy
is compromised..."

274
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,282
No, actually what you wrote was

275
00:15:36,442 --> 00:15:40,250
"Seriously compromised
by his desire to please."

276
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,790
That translates to me as,
"He's a shitty therapist."

277
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,515
I also said that you were one
of the most brilliant...

278
00:15:47,675 --> 00:15:49,819
I know.
You said all kinds of things.

279
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,803
You said that I was your favorite,
that I was the heir apparent.

280
00:15:52,963 --> 00:15:55,115
Why didn't you tell me
that I wasn't good enough?

281
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,973
Because that's not the way I felt.
Why would I say that?

282
00:15:58,133 --> 00:16:00,004
Then I could've gotten on with
my work,

283
00:16:00,164 --> 00:16:03,596
instead of dragging out 8 years
of promises, of drumroll

284
00:16:03,756 --> 00:16:06,125
leading to the worst humiliation
of my life.

285
00:16:06,387 --> 00:16:08,881
You know Walker, even Jeffries,

286
00:16:09,521 --> 00:16:13,386
they said that I was guaranteed
to be the head of the institute.

287
00:16:13,546 --> 00:16:16,159
Across the board,
everybody agreed with it.

288
00:16:16,815 --> 00:16:17,903
Except you.

289
00:16:18,063 --> 00:16:20,700
- I didn't believe you were ready.
- Clearly, you didn't.

290
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,737
The way you took critique,
it made you furious.

291
00:16:24,502 --> 00:16:26,980
You know,
it was one professional assessment.

292
00:16:27,568 --> 00:16:31,043
And you took it personally.
So personally, I had to wonder

293
00:16:31,203 --> 00:16:33,722
if it wasn't an echo
of an earlier rejection.

294
00:16:33,882 --> 00:16:35,967
Please, Gina. Not this again.

295
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:38,533
I know exactly
where you're going with this.

296
00:16:38,693 --> 00:16:40,952
A son who feels
he's disappointed his father;

297
00:16:41,254 --> 00:16:44,904
a son who feels he hasn't lived up
to his father's expectations.

298
00:16:45,503 --> 00:16:47,786
It's something
you would want to address.

299
00:16:47,946 --> 00:16:50,086
Please don't minimize
what you said to me.

300
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:54,235
I wasn't reacting to something
in my past in relation to my father.

301
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:57,111
One review drove you
out of the institute.

302
00:16:57,805 --> 00:17:00,025
That letter pissed on eight years

303
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,396
of my work.

304
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:09,493
Despite it, though,
I became an excellent therapist.

305
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,469
And some people might say that...

306
00:17:13,006 --> 00:17:14,944
I became a better therapist
than you.

307
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,114
Maybe you feel that.

308
00:17:18,376 --> 00:17:21,126
Maybe that's what this is
really about.

309
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:25,808
So let me ask you again.

310
00:17:27,073 --> 00:17:29,756
Why did you come to me specifically?

311
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,770
I suppose because I needed to...

312
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,570
I don't know, test myself.

313
00:17:39,486 --> 00:17:41,348
I mean, I already knew
before I came here

314
00:17:41,508 --> 00:17:43,786
what you were gonna say about me
and Laura and Kate.

315
00:17:43,946 --> 00:17:47,830
But I thought to myself, you know,
if I can withstand your...

316
00:17:48,338 --> 00:17:51,602
corrosive attacks,
your particular brand...

317
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:54,867
- of analytical castration...
- That sounds horrible.

318
00:17:55,027 --> 00:17:57,055
Why put yourself through that?

319
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,064
So that I can...

320
00:18:03,754 --> 00:18:05,347
Trust myself, I suppose.

321
00:18:05,943 --> 00:18:07,193
Trust yourself?

322
00:18:08,131 --> 00:18:09,131
With what?

323
00:18:14,505 --> 00:18:15,505
You know...

324
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:19,497
You said that you were writing a novel.
You know,

325
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,346
I found that kind of amusing,
to tell you the truth,

326
00:18:22,506 --> 00:18:24,776
because a novel
is about complexity.

327
00:18:25,944 --> 00:18:28,794
It's about contradictions,
foibles, human folly.

328
00:18:29,489 --> 00:18:30,639
Not absolutes.

329
00:18:31,818 --> 00:18:33,594
For you, complexity is a problem,

330
00:18:33,754 --> 00:18:36,604
some kind of pathology
that needs to be treated.

331
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:39,974
And you know what I find fucking
offensive, to tell you the truth?

332
00:18:40,134 --> 00:18:43,137
That you think I'm blind
to a situation as obvious

333
00:18:43,297 --> 00:18:45,368
as erotic transference.

334
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,598
Let me just tell you that I treat Laura
with the same integrity,

335
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:56,441
the same concern, the same rigor

336
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:58,513
as I treat all my patients.

337
00:19:00,444 --> 00:19:02,394
I happen to like my patients.

338
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,874
That's the difference
between you and me.

339
00:19:05,034 --> 00:19:07,597
I worry about them.
I identify with them.

340
00:19:07,757 --> 00:19:10,184
I put myself out for them.
You analyze them.

341
00:19:13,116 --> 00:19:15,403
I analyze too, but I empathize.

342
00:19:19,923 --> 00:19:23,108
Let me ask you something.
I'm just curious about this.

343
00:19:26,938 --> 00:19:27,993
Do you miss

344
00:19:28,596 --> 00:19:29,893
having patients?

345
00:19:31,365 --> 00:19:32,165
Why?

346
00:19:32,844 --> 00:19:35,214
I was never really 100% convinced,

347
00:19:35,568 --> 00:19:38,171
to be honest,
that you actually like this process,

348
00:19:39,904 --> 00:19:41,782
the sitting down with a patient.

349
00:19:43,131 --> 00:19:46,725
That's because in your opinion,
I have no empathy, and so,

350
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,914
how could I get any satisfaction
from it?

351
00:19:49,074 --> 00:19:51,782
I'm not saying you don't get
satisfaction from it in the same way

352
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:53,603
that a sail-maker or...

353
00:19:53,865 --> 00:19:55,272
or a chemist gets,

354
00:19:55,707 --> 00:19:59,247
when they practice their craft.
But that thing I'm talking about

355
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,615
that exists between a doctor
and a patient...

356
00:20:01,775 --> 00:20:04,121
That connection, that buzz...

357
00:20:07,024 --> 00:20:09,392
See, I can't help but connect...

358
00:20:10,124 --> 00:20:11,450
with the person.

359
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:14,598
That's who I am as a therapist.

360
00:20:14,758 --> 00:20:15,993
That's my...

361
00:20:17,205 --> 00:20:18,174
reward.

362
00:20:30,723 --> 00:20:32,350
A while ago, before...

363
00:20:32,612 --> 00:20:34,656
Before I started coming here...

364
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:37,621
There was...

365
00:20:38,757 --> 00:20:40,607
There was a session that...

366
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:44,705
Laura cried.

367
00:20:47,114 --> 00:20:48,803
She'd never actually...

368
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,576
done that before.

369
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,165
That's a kind of a victory, right?
It's kind of a milestone for a therapist

370
00:20:56,685 --> 00:20:59,080
when you get the patient
to that point where they...

371
00:20:59,368 --> 00:21:00,753
Where they cry...

372
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:10,809
It was different with her.
There was something so...

373
00:21:12,447 --> 00:21:15,597
So moving about seeing her
just break down like that.

374
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,556
In that moment, I swear,

375
00:21:22,378 --> 00:21:24,346
I could've said, "Fuck it all.

376
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:26,733
"I just want to be with her."

377
00:21:27,643 --> 00:21:28,806
But I didn't.

378
00:21:29,843 --> 00:21:32,533
I came to you instead.
I came especially to you.

379
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:34,871
I chose you
'cause I thought to myself:

380
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:37,270
"If Gina can't convince me to...

381
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,835
"to stay away, then how am I gonna
convince myself?"

382
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,370
It's really tough
when I'm alone with her, you know?

383
00:21:50,818 --> 00:21:53,568
And she's asking me:
"Please, just be honest.

384
00:21:54,569 --> 00:21:56,560
"Please, tell me how you feel."

385
00:21:58,364 --> 00:21:59,414
And I can't.

386
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:04,046
I guess the reason I'm here
is because

387
00:22:05,488 --> 00:22:08,221
I really want to look at this.
I want to examine it.

388
00:22:08,381 --> 00:22:10,931
I want to be absolutely clear
about this...

389
00:22:12,737 --> 00:22:14,988
One hundred percent,
that it's not...

390
00:22:18,633 --> 00:22:19,783
That I'm not...

391
00:22:21,009 --> 00:22:22,559
That you're not what?

392
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:31,581
You need to say it.

393
00:22:32,447 --> 00:22:34,138
You need to finish the thought.

394
00:22:35,879 --> 00:22:37,329
That what I want...

395
00:22:39,384 --> 00:22:41,976
Isn't, in some way, immoral...

396
00:22:43,881 --> 00:22:45,031
Or...

397
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,063
unethical.

398
00:22:48,448 --> 00:22:50,098
And that it's not abuse,

399
00:22:50,928 --> 00:22:53,074
an abuse of my power as a doctor

400
00:22:53,694 --> 00:22:54,944
with a patient.

401
00:23:13,007 --> 00:23:14,657
I'm not pushing you out.

402
00:23:16,132 --> 00:23:18,974
I'm not running away,
no matter what you tell me.

403
00:23:19,134 --> 00:23:22,184
At the institute,

404
00:23:22,977 --> 00:23:26,876
maybe that was hubris on my part.
I don't know, it might have been.

405
00:23:28,134 --> 00:23:30,784
But I won't do that now.
I won't reject you.

406
00:23:31,287 --> 00:23:33,598
That doesn't mean
I'm gonna let you do something

407
00:23:33,758 --> 00:23:36,038
that you'll regret
the rest of your life,

408
00:23:36,198 --> 00:23:38,448
not without fighting you every step.

409
00:23:39,221 --> 00:23:41,025
If it's safety you need,

410
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:42,881
this is it.

411
00:23:46,013 --> 00:23:48,785
We've already crossed
lines of conduct in this room.

412
00:23:48,945 --> 00:23:51,218
I'm saying that
because I want you to know

413
00:23:51,378 --> 00:23:53,213
how far I'm willing to go.

414
00:23:54,371 --> 00:23:55,936
Whatever you tell me,

415
00:23:56,889 --> 00:23:58,264
I'm here for you.

416
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:01,107
I won't abandon you.

417
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:03,746
No matter what,

418
00:24:05,796 --> 00:24:06,765
I'm here.

419
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,012
I love her.

420
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:19,909
I love Laura.

421
00:24:20,965 --> 00:24:24,415
Every word out of her mouth,
every move she makes, I just...

422
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,878
I love talking to her, you know?
Just listening to her.

423
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,120
I know it's a joke, cliché...

424
00:24:35,695 --> 00:24:38,745
50-year-old married man
in love with a 30-year-old.

425
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:41,695
But I want to be with her

426
00:24:42,071 --> 00:24:43,723
and I don't care what it means.

427
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:45,933
And I don't care what it costs.

428
00:24:46,634 --> 00:24:47,784
I don't care.

429
00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:01,259
I love her.
