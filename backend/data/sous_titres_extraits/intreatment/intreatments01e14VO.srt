2
00:00:09,112 --> 00:00:10,848
We were watching TV and I said,

3
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:13,247
"I don't think this pregnancy's
worth fighting over."

4
00:00:13,445 --> 00:00:15,729
And I said,
"I think I might want this baby."

5
00:00:16,462 --> 00:00:19,120
I don't know if I'd ever
be able to get pregnant again.

6
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:24,571
Amy, let me in.

7
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:27,705
What happened?
What, she had a miscarriage?

8
00:00:27,825 --> 00:00:29,325
I'm seeing someone.

9
00:00:30,157 --> 00:00:31,607
Who the fuck is he?!

10
00:00:31,846 --> 00:00:33,467
What really gets me

11
00:00:33,587 --> 00:00:35,789
is that you can go to this guy's place

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,917
and then you can come home here all

13
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:40,747
wet and flushed and excited and horny

14
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:43,616
and you can sit down with our son
and do his homework.

15
00:00:44,206 --> 00:00:46,155
How does that make you feel?

16
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:48,418
It makes me feel like shit.

17
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:11,801
So,

18
00:01:13,013 --> 00:01:16,207
- how are you feeling?
- Fine. Thanks for calling.

19
00:01:22,956 --> 00:01:24,106
No Jake?

20
00:01:29,231 --> 00:01:35,785
www.swsub.com

21
00:01:46,063 --> 00:01:47,813
Remember, I told you both

22
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:51,011
at the beginning,
that in couple's therapy

23
00:01:51,293 --> 00:01:53,042
we don't meet alone,

24
00:01:53,529 --> 00:01:55,578
unless the third party agrees.

25
00:01:56,982 --> 00:01:58,873
What if I want private sessions?

26
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,671
You mean you want to begin
individual therapy?

27
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,466
I think it would be better
if it wasn't with me.

28
00:02:10,837 --> 00:02:13,286
- Why? You afraid of Jake?
- No

29
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,431
Should I be?

30
00:02:15,947 --> 00:02:17,017
Why then?

31
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:22,473
It's like three friends,
who go to a restaurant

32
00:02:22,593 --> 00:02:25,752
for dinner and then two of us
decide that we gonna go to a movie

33
00:02:26,182 --> 00:02:28,461
without telling the third person.

34
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,697
You ask me to a movie?

35
00:02:32,602 --> 00:02:35,644
I think we have to agree that
Jake can hear everything

36
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:38,783
- that we say here.
- Okay, fine.

37
00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:41,346
It's couple's therapy.

38
00:02:41,466 --> 00:02:44,051
Jake's entitled to hear
whatever we say. It's great.

39
00:03:00,925 --> 00:03:01,675
So...

40
00:03:03,014 --> 00:03:04,540
How do you feel?

41
00:03:05,183 --> 00:03:06,136
Fine.

42
00:03:07,107 --> 00:03:08,861
- Were you worried?
- Yes.

43
00:03:09,238 --> 00:03:11,237
- Very.
- Really, you worried about me?

44
00:03:12,589 --> 00:03:15,800
- Are you surprised about that?
- It's nice to hear.

45
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:20,694
- Did you worry about Jake too?
- I was worried about you both.

46
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,260
Who'd you worried about more?

47
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,563
See, he... He is here.

48
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:35,048
Actually I worried about you more

49
00:03:36,328 --> 00:03:38,978
because you are the one
who went through it.

50
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,582
Physically.

51
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:44,850
Actually, I feel great.

52
00:03:45,999 --> 00:03:47,652
I feel too good.

53
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,693
- Too good?
- I feel really really good.

54
00:03:52,492 --> 00:03:53,641
And that's...

55
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,966
- That's not good?
- I feel happy, I feel

56
00:03:57,172 --> 00:03:59,953
like I have energy, I feel like
doing things, putting on make-up,

57
00:04:00,193 --> 00:04:01,453
and going out dancing.

58
00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:08,210
- You think I'm a monster.
- No.

59
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,880
- Just a little bit.
- No, not at all.

60
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:13,466
Jake hates me.

61
00:04:14,183 --> 00:04:16,316
And you too.
He thinks we conspire against him,

62
00:04:16,436 --> 00:04:20,151
- and will never come here again.
- Did you tell him you are coming?

63
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:22,076
No, he doesn't want me coming here.

64
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:25,205
Do you feel the need
to hide things from him again?

65
00:04:25,325 --> 00:04:27,690
I... I don't have the energy to argue.
I don't know,

66
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,760
he probably wants me to feel awful
after what happened

67
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,275
and he knows that you'll help me
not feel like that.

68
00:04:33,727 --> 00:04:35,155
Is that what you want?

69
00:04:35,884 --> 00:04:38,145
For me to help you not to feel awful?

70
00:04:38,265 --> 00:04:40,190
Actually, no. Just the opposite.

71
00:04:41,007 --> 00:04:43,922
I came here
because I'm not feeling bad enough.

72
00:04:44,598 --> 00:04:46,498
And you feel bad about that?

73
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,190
I'm a woman who loses a baby.

74
00:04:49,782 --> 00:04:51,962
She'd feel grief, right?
That's what expected.

75
00:04:52,315 --> 00:04:53,564
Or perhaps

76
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,160
You just feel relieved.

77
00:04:57,049 --> 00:05:00,299
- After all your concerns and all the...
- I had no concerns.

78
00:05:00,871 --> 00:05:02,221
I didn't want it.

79
00:05:04,987 --> 00:05:07,633
So what is feeling good surprise you?

80
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:13,831
It isn't surprising as much
as it's disturbing. You know I mean...

81
00:05:14,374 --> 00:05:17,124
What's wrong with me?
Don't I have feelings?

82
00:05:26,162 --> 00:05:28,161
Why are you silent?

83
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:31,335
You think I don't have feelings?

84
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,954
No, I...

85
00:05:33,915 --> 00:05:35,881
That's a very serious accusation,
doctor.

86
00:05:37,668 --> 00:05:39,218
That is not what I think.

87
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,272
But you are silent,
and I ain't believe you.

88
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:44,182
Are you trying to pick a fight with me?

89
00:05:47,563 --> 00:05:49,894
'Cause sometimes I feel

90
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:55,102
you need to be defiant,
that you need to oppose and

91
00:05:55,892 --> 00:05:57,737
- be opposed...
- Opposed what?

92
00:05:59,051 --> 00:06:00,797
I don't know. Your husband, me.

93
00:06:01,898 --> 00:06:05,573
A society that decides a woman
should desperately want a child,

94
00:06:06,005 --> 00:06:09,423
that decides a woman
should mourn when she miscarries.

95
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,478
It's a little embarrassing,

96
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,129
you know,
when you start playing the shrink.

97
00:06:16,273 --> 00:06:18,822
You suddenly got all chatty. It's very

98
00:06:19,352 --> 00:06:21,261
Very un-alpha-male of you.

99
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:24,097
Does it bother you
that I'm un-alpha-male?

100
00:06:24,337 --> 00:06:26,264
It should bother you,
doesn't bother me.

101
00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:28,673
That's too bad actually
'cause you could

102
00:06:28,793 --> 00:06:30,092
look pretty good.

103
00:06:30,343 --> 00:06:33,564
I mean, under the right circumstances,
you could be handsome even.

104
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,526
Under what circumstances?

105
00:06:37,442 --> 00:06:40,236
I don't know, on a desert island,

106
00:06:40,356 --> 00:06:42,365
when I'm unconscious.

107
00:06:46,734 --> 00:06:49,914
I'm just kidding.
You're very handsome.

108
00:06:56,146 --> 00:06:57,196
Is it Jake?

109
00:06:59,463 --> 00:07:00,943
Where does he think you are?

110
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,596
I don't know, maybe fucking Reeves.

111
00:07:05,836 --> 00:07:07,223
Your boss?

112
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:09,699
That's alright, I don't think that.

113
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,813
Is he attracted to you, Reeves?

114
00:07:14,404 --> 00:07:16,774
- Why wouldn't he be?
- What about you?

115
00:07:17,712 --> 00:07:19,586
Doctor, I'm a married woman.

116
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,032
So why is Jake so worried
about you and Reeves?

117
00:07:26,252 --> 00:07:27,391
He's scared.

118
00:07:29,118 --> 00:07:30,167
What about you?

119
00:07:33,143 --> 00:07:34,167
What about me?

120
00:07:34,986 --> 00:07:36,457
What do you think about me?

121
00:07:42,928 --> 00:07:44,878
I think you're flirting with me.

122
00:07:48,864 --> 00:07:50,892
Why on Earth would I do that?

123
00:07:52,386 --> 00:07:53,599
I don't know.

124
00:07:54,151 --> 00:07:55,860
Maybe keep Jake on his toes.

125
00:07:57,165 --> 00:07:58,451
Like with Reeves.

126
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,181
I was just kidding.

127
00:08:12,545 --> 00:08:14,540
Are you annoyed with me?

128
00:08:16,202 --> 00:08:17,764
I don't feel anything, remember?

129
00:08:18,784 --> 00:08:21,464
I thought maybe I upset you,
that's all.

130
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,672
I'm not upset.

131
00:08:25,173 --> 00:08:26,330
I'm just...

132
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,352
Bored...

133
00:08:39,713 --> 00:08:41,000
Where's the stain?

134
00:08:44,602 --> 00:08:47,782
I saw it when we left. You must
have scrubbed the couch like a lunatic.

135
00:08:49,336 --> 00:08:52,120
Actually, it came off quite easily.

136
00:08:57,012 --> 00:08:59,070
I'm surprised, I...

137
00:09:00,108 --> 00:09:02,865
I actually thought you'd have
been down in all foes

138
00:09:02,985 --> 00:09:06,884
scrubbing away and your wife standing
over you shouting instructions and

139
00:09:07,698 --> 00:09:10,461
You wiping the sweat from your brow,
saying "it's not coming out,

140
00:09:10,581 --> 00:09:14,071
"I don't know what to do.
My next patient'll be here any minute."

141
00:09:18,262 --> 00:09:20,968
I didn't think it would
come out that easily.

142
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,311
Did you want it to still be there?

143
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:29,490
Yes, I was very attached to it.

144
00:09:29,895 --> 00:09:31,909
Have some sense of humor, come on!

145
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,046
Yes, I...

146
00:09:36,783 --> 00:09:39,153
I don't find it so funny.

147
00:09:42,057 --> 00:09:43,656
I think you're disappointed.

148
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:47,091
Why you making such a big deal
out of it?

149
00:09:47,331 --> 00:09:49,719
What were you expecting to feel
when you saw it?

150
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:52,118
Nothing.

151
00:09:53,211 --> 00:09:54,849
No sadness?

152
00:09:59,203 --> 00:10:00,030
No grief?

153
00:10:02,437 --> 00:10:03,833
Over a stain?

154
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,547
Over the loss of your baby.

155
00:10:13,426 --> 00:10:15,943
Maybe you wanted
to see that stain because...

156
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:19,086
you needed to accept it.

157
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,429
And all the...

158
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,462
the mixed feeling you have about it.

159
00:11:12,342 --> 00:11:13,426
Hello, Jake.

160
00:11:14,142 --> 00:11:15,669
Don't mean to interrupt.

161
00:11:19,986 --> 00:11:21,456
What you doing here?

162
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,525
It's couple's counseling, isn't it?

163
00:11:26,087 --> 00:11:28,016
I thought you said
you weren't coming back.

164
00:11:29,016 --> 00:11:30,809
We weren't coming back, remember?

165
00:11:32,604 --> 00:11:35,655
I just wanted to talk to Paul alone
after what happened.

166
00:11:36,104 --> 00:11:37,410
Were you following me?

167
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:42,665
You think I was following you?

168
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:46,506
Should I be following you?

169
00:11:59,362 --> 00:12:01,517
So what were you just talking about?

170
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:04,621
I didn't say a word to him last week
while we waited for you.

171
00:12:04,741 --> 00:12:07,732
- 2 weeks ago.
- Whatever. Not a word in 15 min.

172
00:12:08,093 --> 00:12:11,360
- You said you weren't coming, so...
- I know what I said. I'm here, OK?

173
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:21,441
What's that?

174
00:12:23,432 --> 00:12:25,875
I'm not pregnant anymore.
Why does everything you say

175
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,418
sound like an accusation?

176
00:12:27,658 --> 00:12:30,426
- Accusation?
- You interrogate me, and then

177
00:12:30,546 --> 00:12:33,923
whatever I say or do, I'm guilty.
I can't win with you.

178
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:36,766
Doc, my wife's paranoid.
Can you treat that?

179
00:12:36,886 --> 00:12:39,045
You're so crass it's frightening.

180
00:12:42,627 --> 00:12:43,726
So how are you?

181
00:12:44,584 --> 00:12:46,562
- I'm quite well. Thank you.
- That's great.

182
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:49,061
That's fantastic.

183
00:12:53,712 --> 00:12:55,364
You're very quiet today.

184
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:58,368
Oh, that's right. I forgot.
You're here to just nod your head

185
00:12:58,488 --> 00:13:00,778
and do a little damage
from time to time.

186
00:13:01,318 --> 00:13:02,900
What do you mean "damage"?

187
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:05,580
I don't know. I wasn't here.
You were talking to Amy.

188
00:13:08,923 --> 00:13:12,087
So you're here to survey...
the damage?

189
00:13:12,562 --> 00:13:15,508
- I'm here because she's here.
- Not for yourself?

190
00:13:15,748 --> 00:13:18,870
Does it bother you that I'm here?
I'm paying, so I don't care.

191
00:13:19,022 --> 00:13:20,762
You got guts talking about money.

192
00:13:21,194 --> 00:13:23,641
- It's not his money. It's mine.
- That's right. I forgot.

193
00:13:24,455 --> 00:13:25,861
Everything is yours, right?

194
00:13:25,981 --> 00:13:29,187
The money is yours, the pregnancy
and the miscarriage too.

195
00:13:29,568 --> 00:13:30,731
Everything's yours.

196
00:13:31,147 --> 00:13:34,484
Do you feel it's damaging for Amy
to talk to me?

197
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:37,393
Well, if she leaves our child
on your couch, it is.

198
00:13:49,212 --> 00:13:51,682
How do you feel about what happened with

199
00:13:52,814 --> 00:13:54,087
Amy's pregnancy, Jake?

200
00:13:55,476 --> 00:13:56,550
I feel like shit.

201
00:13:58,158 --> 00:13:59,872
Would you like to talk about it?

202
00:14:06,496 --> 00:14:09,103
- I don't wanna talk if he's here.
- Why?

203
00:14:10,546 --> 00:14:12,077
What do you got to hide?

204
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,108
You know you're insane, don't you?

205
00:14:14,582 --> 00:14:16,692
What do you think I'm hiding?

206
00:14:22,431 --> 00:14:24,966
Amy, do you see how your behavior

207
00:14:25,086 --> 00:14:27,485
might sometimes encourage
Jake's suspicions?

208
00:14:36,346 --> 00:14:37,757
Did she make a pass at you?

209
00:14:40,116 --> 00:14:41,395
What if I did?

210
00:14:41,603 --> 00:14:43,512
You're hitting on our therapist too?

211
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:47,747
You are fucking unbelievable. Why?
Because he's a doctor?

212
00:14:48,424 --> 00:14:49,768
He could be your father.

213
00:14:50,508 --> 00:14:52,927
- Sorry, Paul.
- Don't apologize for me, all right?

214
00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:56,756
- Why are you so threatened by Paul?
- I'm not. He doesn't worry me.

215
00:14:56,876 --> 00:15:00,153
- Your compulsion worries me.
- What do you mean "compulsion"?

216
00:15:00,395 --> 00:15:02,489
- She knows.
- No, I'm asking you.

217
00:15:06,008 --> 00:15:07,703
A compulsion to

218
00:15:08,186 --> 00:15:09,662
come on to men.

219
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:14,209
And do you think that's a pattern?

220
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,129
- Why do you think she does that?
- Ask her.

221
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,427
No, I'm asking you.

222
00:15:22,842 --> 00:15:25,929
Sometimes people behave like that
when they feel trapped

223
00:15:26,171 --> 00:15:28,556
- in a relationship.
- Is that what she told you?

224
00:15:30,006 --> 00:15:31,643
I'm asking you, Jake.

225
00:15:32,812 --> 00:15:35,250
Why does she want to fuck Reeves?

226
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:46,199
- She loves authority.
- What about you?

227
00:15:46,441 --> 00:15:48,285
You're not authoritative?

228
00:15:48,731 --> 00:15:51,744
Authoritative and authority
aren't the same thing.

229
00:15:54,994 --> 00:15:57,407
There must have been other bosses
before Reeves.

230
00:15:58,813 --> 00:16:01,174
Was Jake jealous of them too, Amy?

231
00:16:04,427 --> 00:16:06,803
- What's different with Reeves?
- It's not about him.

232
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:09,597
- It's about her. She's changed.
- In what way?

233
00:16:12,962 --> 00:16:14,978
She didn't used to have
that look in her eye.

234
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:19,315
- What do you mean, "look"?
- That look.

235
00:16:21,203 --> 00:16:22,302
Right there.

236
00:16:24,071 --> 00:16:25,287
On the prowl.

237
00:16:31,606 --> 00:16:33,174
She's out of control.

238
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:34,849
Is it possible that

239
00:16:35,402 --> 00:16:38,552
Amy's pregnancy
was a chance for you to…

240
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:40,061
control her?

241
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:43,090
A pregnancy, a baby...
It's not that easy to get out

242
00:16:43,465 --> 00:16:46,859
"on the prowl" as you put it.
She's much more restricted.

243
00:16:47,137 --> 00:16:50,607
Perhaps like in the good old days
when Lenny was a baby,

244
00:16:50,934 --> 00:16:53,933
- and she was more...
- House-broken, tamed, brain-dead.

245
00:16:54,469 --> 00:16:56,438
I got pregnant a month after we met.

246
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,421
I gave up my freedom the day I met you.

247
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:01,483
I'd like to pay you. I don't think
we paid for the last two weeks.

248
00:17:02,466 --> 00:17:04,987
We do have... a few minutes.

249
00:17:05,477 --> 00:17:07,531
I'm leaving.
Shit, I can't find my checkbook.

250
00:17:07,771 --> 00:17:10,533
- You're leaving without me?
- I came without you. Where is it?

251
00:17:10,653 --> 00:17:12,852
- Where are you going?
- I don't know. Sorry, Paul.

252
00:17:12,972 --> 00:17:14,705
- When will you be home?
- We'll see.

253
00:17:14,945 --> 00:17:17,374
- How about Lenny's dinner?
- How about his loving father

254
00:17:17,614 --> 00:17:20,002
- cooks dinner for him?
- I said where are you going?

255
00:17:20,242 --> 00:17:22,371
You shit! What do you mean,
"on the prowl"?

256
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:24,423
What am I?
Some fucking animal in heat?

257
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:28,822
- I'm glad I'm not pregnant any more.
- Really?

258
00:17:28,942 --> 00:17:31,213
- You're glad our baby died?
- Yes.

259
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,011
And I'm not gonna go around
looking sad for you anymore.

260
00:17:34,131 --> 00:17:37,610
I didn't want this baby,
and man, fucking hell, I know why.

261
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:56,547
Was it three sessions?

262
00:17:56,945 --> 00:17:59,708
It doesn't matter.
We can sort this out next week.

263
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:01,075
It's not a problem.

264
00:18:02,758 --> 00:18:03,998
I owe you $80.

265
00:18:05,162 --> 00:18:06,879
This has been really great.

266
00:18:06,999 --> 00:18:09,802
Two more of these and we'll trade
you in for a good divorce attorney.

267
00:18:10,042 --> 00:18:12,846
Maybe you should start coming here
before that happens.

268
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:16,004
As you said yourself,
you have been here for Amy,

269
00:18:16,341 --> 00:18:17,800
not for yourself.

270
00:18:18,489 --> 00:18:21,903
Maybe you should start
coming back here... for you.

271
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:18,097
Hey, I heard music. Are you done?

272
00:19:21,603 --> 00:19:22,842
Are you going out?

273
00:19:25,118 --> 00:19:27,184
Well, I'm going to Caroline's

274
00:19:27,828 --> 00:19:30,544
because she asked me to come over
and give her some advice.

275
00:19:30,664 --> 00:19:33,576
- They're redecorating.
- You got a new career.

276
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:34,982
Great.

277
00:19:36,822 --> 00:19:39,896
She likes my taste.
Do you have a problem with that?

278
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:43,771
Is there anything to eat?

279
00:19:47,967 --> 00:19:49,860
No, Paul, you can order in.

280
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,766
You're really losing it. You know that?

281
00:19:52,886 --> 00:19:54,656
Because there's nothing for you to eat?

282
00:19:54,896 --> 00:19:57,343
No, because you haven't been home
a single night this week.

283
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,301
- What about your kids?
- I don't know.

284
00:19:59,421 --> 00:20:02,032
Maybe they'll suddenly discover
they have a father.

285
00:20:02,152 --> 00:20:03,944
You're doing this for them?

286
00:20:04,064 --> 00:20:07,419
You're having an affair so that
they can rediscover their father.

287
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,247
No, I'm doing it for me.

288
00:20:11,178 --> 00:20:13,184
You know,
I came down here to tell you

289
00:20:13,304 --> 00:20:15,511
that I'm not gonna be here next week.

290
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:19,040
- I'm going away for a couple of days.
- A couple of days?

291
00:20:19,981 --> 00:20:22,810
Rosie won't be here, and I'll have
my mother come and help with Max.

292
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,327
What is this?

293
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,356
What are you talking about,
you're going away for a few days?

294
00:20:28,574 --> 00:20:30,400
It's for a week actually.

295
00:20:37,268 --> 00:20:38,183
With...

296
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,120
With him?

297
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,957
Where're you going?

298
00:20:50,354 --> 00:20:51,130
Rome.

299
00:20:53,282 --> 00:20:54,088
Rome.

300
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:57,803
Rome? Of all the cities?

301
00:20:58,864 --> 00:20:59,670
Rome.

302
00:21:00,545 --> 00:21:02,307
What is this, some kind of revenge?

303
00:21:02,768 --> 00:21:04,978
No, Rome is completely coincidental.

304
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:07,796
It was some deal he got with work
or something.

305
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:10,360
Next to the passports,
there's some business cards

306
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,761
of our favorite restaurants in Rome.

307
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:16,775
Maybe I can book you two
into the... <i>Il Palazetto</i>, maybe?

308
00:21:17,187 --> 00:21:20,409
- You know, all you had to...
- Why don't you just get out of here?

309
00:21:26,246 --> 00:21:28,107
I don't intend to feel guilty, you know.

310
00:21:28,227 --> 00:21:30,739
I'm not really interested
in what you feel.

311
00:21:30,859 --> 00:21:34,971
- You have made that perfectly clear.
- Just close the door behind you.
