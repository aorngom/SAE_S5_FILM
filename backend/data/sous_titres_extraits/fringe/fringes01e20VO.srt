1
00:00:07,321 --> 00:00:09,826
G.S.W, left-upper quadrant,
possible hemothorax.

2
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:12,372
BP is dropping 80 over 50.
Pulse 120.

3
00:00:12,418 --> 00:00:13,139
Breath sounds?

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,886
Decreased on the left side,
labored but stable.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,961
Get me
a chest scan.

6
00:00:16,003 --> 00:00:16,823
Doctor...

7
00:00:17,381 --> 00:00:18,394
There's something else.

8
00:00:24,902 --> 00:00:26,533
Sir, I just heard
about Nina Sharp.

9
00:00:26,564 --> 00:00:27,781
Do we know
who shot her?

10
00:00:27,822 --> 00:00:28,829
Trying to
figure that out.

11
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,769
The security guard and doorman
in the lobby are dead.

12
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:31,681
No I.D.
on the gunman.

13
00:00:31,716 --> 00:00:33,423
- Well, is she gonna be--
- Too early to say.

14
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,247
Sir.

15
00:00:34,496 --> 00:00:36,189
No official statement
from Massive Dynamic,

16
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,736
- or William Bell.
- Thanks.

17
00:00:38,255 --> 00:00:39,420
That's no surprise.

18
00:00:39,608 --> 00:00:41,989
If they say the C.O.O. was shot,
their stock will take a hit.

19
00:00:42,158 --> 00:00:44,616
Hey Liv,
security footage just came in.

20
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:49,015
We had video tech assemble
the three video cameras.

21
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,031
They shoot
the night guy...

22
00:00:51,994 --> 00:00:53,080
They replace him.

23
00:00:55,474 --> 00:00:58,222
Then this guy comes in
and they all head upstairs.

24
00:01:01,315 --> 00:01:01,667
<i>Evening.</i>

25
00:01:01,707 --> 00:01:03,800
Nina Sharp comes in
six minutes later.

26
00:01:21,723 --> 00:01:23,436
Then it goes black
for four minutes.

27
00:01:23,757 --> 00:01:24,902
What did
he do to her?

28
00:01:25,277 --> 00:01:26,276
<i>Whatever it was...</i>

29
00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:27,870
It only took them
four minutes.

30
00:01:28,231 --> 00:01:29,331
Who is he?

31
00:01:32,957 --> 00:01:34,467
Can we enhance
what he said?

32
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:35,393
Sure.

33
00:01:36,309 --> 00:01:39,044
<i>Take out the camera.
We can do it here.</i>

34
00:01:39,234 --> 00:01:41,981
<i>Take out the camera.
We can do it here.</i>

35
00:01:42,424 --> 00:01:45,216
<i>Take out the camera.
We can do it here.</i>

36
00:01:45,347 --> 00:01:47,860
<i>Take out the camera.
We can do it here.</i>

37
00:01:47,992 --> 00:01:50,463
<i>Take out the camera.
We can do it here.</i>

38
00:01:50,924 --> 00:01:52,422
Run it
through voice recognition.

39
00:01:58,812 --> 00:02:01,433
<i>Take out the camera.
We can do it here.</i>

40
00:02:02,127 --> 00:02:04,711
<i>Take out the camera.
We can do it here.</i>

41
00:02:05,338 --> 00:02:07,923
<i>Take out the camera.
We can do it here.</i>

42
00:02:12,223 --> 00:02:13,944
<i>David Robert Jones.</i>

43
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:16,058
Why is he
wearing bandages

44
00:02:16,113 --> 00:02:18,074
and the others
are wearing masks?

45
00:02:18,515 --> 00:02:19,596
Not easy to walk around

46
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:21,277
when you're on half
the world's watch list.

47
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:23,190
Maybe he's recently tried
to change his appearance.

48
00:02:23,225 --> 00:02:24,596
But all
our information suggests

49
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,205
that Jones
is working for Bell.

50
00:02:26,241 --> 00:02:27,454
So why shoot
his number two?

51
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:28,552
It doesn't make any sense.

52
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:30,124
Maybe our information
is wrong.

53
00:02:30,814 --> 00:02:32,237
<i>Why don't we go
straight to the source</i>

54
00:02:32,273 --> 00:02:34,384
<i>and bring William Bell
in for questioning now?</i>

55
00:02:34,872 --> 00:02:35,749
At this point,
I don't think that--

56
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,536
We have solid intelligence
that William Bell

57
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:39,431
is funding these horrific events
that we've seen.

58
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:42,063
Most of which
have been carried out by Jones.

59
00:02:42,108 --> 00:02:43,092
- I'm not--
- At this point,

60
00:02:43,113 --> 00:02:45,129
I don't care
<i>how</i> powerful William Bell is

61
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,311
or how deep
his political connections go,

62
00:02:47,348 --> 00:02:49,041
he is not
above the law.

63
00:02:49,076 --> 00:02:51,324
- Dunham--
- Sir, with all due respect,

64
00:02:51,354 --> 00:02:54,320
I have too much in this,
professionally and personally,

65
00:02:54,355 --> 00:02:56,103
that if you stand
in the way now, I--

66
00:02:56,138 --> 00:02:56,880
Dunham!

67
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,033
I came in here to begin
making the calls

68
00:03:00,068 --> 00:03:01,332
I'm going
to need to make in order

69
00:03:01,353 --> 00:03:04,161
to get the interview
that we both agree is necessary.

70
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:07,310
And I would also request
that you stop cutting me off

71
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,510
every time
I'm about to tell you

72
00:03:08,572 --> 00:03:10,032
to stop drilling,
you've struck oil,

73
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:12,609
as I was going to do when
we first came through that door.

74
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:18,913
This is Broyles.

75
00:03:24,094 --> 00:03:25,618
Nina Sharp
is out of surgery.

76
00:03:34,313 --> 00:03:35,026
<i>Hey.</i>

77
00:03:35,027 --> 00:03:35,745
Hey.

78
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,828
Where's Walter?

79
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,220
- With you?
- Uh-uh.

80
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:40,448
I went to check on him
this morning,

81
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,393
his bed wasn't even
slept in.

82
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:42,508
I thought he'd worked
here all night.

83
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,166
I thought he went home
with you last night.

84
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,563
Hey, uh,
I need to talk to Walter.

85
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:48,261
Is he here?

86
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,275
Yeah,
take a number.

87
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,769
I'm gonna
check the cafeteria,

88
00:03:50,816 --> 00:03:51,996
see if he slept
there again.

89
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:52,636
<i>Okay.</i>

90
00:03:54,685 --> 00:03:55,648
You don't look
so good.

91
00:03:56,293 --> 00:03:58,395
David Robert Jones
shot Nina Sharp.

92
00:03:58,543 --> 00:03:59,337
I wanted to see if--

93
00:03:59,368 --> 00:04:01,720
Hi--Hi, uh,
it's Peter Bishop calling.

94
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:02,791
I was wondering
if you

95
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,591
maybe have an eye
on my father?

96
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:06,830
He wandered off again.

97
00:04:07,737 --> 00:04:08,632
Yeah.

98
00:04:09,897 --> 00:04:10,873
Look,
can you do me a favor?

99
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,667
Could you go check down
in the marine biology lab?

100
00:04:12,743 --> 00:04:14,439
He--He sometimes spends
the night down there,

101
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:16,118
cleaning out the tanks
with Mrs. Ericson.

102
00:04:17,803 --> 00:04:19,893
No, I'll wait--I'll wait.
Thank you.

103
00:04:20,002 --> 00:04:21,457
Do you think he left
because of what I said?

104
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:24,354
You mean because
of what he is referring to

105
00:04:24,393 --> 00:04:25,728
as "the assault
in the pastry shop?"

106
00:04:25,774 --> 00:04:26,939
I don't know,
it's hard to say.

107
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:28,868
It was
about Cortexiphan...

108
00:04:29,393 --> 00:04:30,418
Bell's trials.

109
00:04:30,454 --> 00:04:32,973
I wanted to see if Walter
knew what Bell did to me.

110
00:04:33,037 --> 00:04:34,141
I know,
he told me.

111
00:04:35,027 --> 00:04:36,165
You caught him
off-guard.

112
00:04:36,884 --> 00:04:38,447
And I understand
you had your reasons

113
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:40,275
to saying what it is
that you had to say.

114
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:42,895
And I know
he understands that too.

115
00:04:43,268 --> 00:04:44,150
He's not there.

116
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:45,487
No one's seen him.

117
00:04:46,518 --> 00:04:47,218
Hello.

118
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:50,975
No luck, huh?

119
00:04:51,795 --> 00:04:52,924
Okay, well thanks
for your help.

120
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:54,318
Peter...

121
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:58,708
I--I'm sorry
that I was so hard on him.

122
00:05:01,011 --> 00:05:02,438
Look,
don't worry about it.

123
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:03,872
He's probably
back at the hotel right now,

124
00:05:03,906 --> 00:05:05,994
working his way to the bottom
of a pint of Rocky Road.

125
00:06:00,232 --> 00:06:01,288
I think
to repair that one

126
00:06:01,338 --> 00:06:02,965
<i>requires
a special skill set.</i>

127
00:06:05,124 --> 00:06:05,942
Phillip.

128
00:06:07,664 --> 00:06:08,721
You've been shot.

129
00:06:10,154 --> 00:06:11,674
We discovered
it was Jones.

130
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:13,776
You're lucky.

131
00:06:14,882 --> 00:06:16,994
Not too many gunshot victims
have come through this way

132
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,828
have Kevlar parts
in their rib cage.

133
00:06:19,126 --> 00:06:20,675
You'll be up and about
in no time.

134
00:06:21,442 --> 00:06:22,743
What did he want,
Nina?

135
00:06:23,585 --> 00:06:24,928
What did he do
to your arm?

136
00:06:34,078 --> 00:06:35,341
Get me
Agent Dunham.

137
00:06:36,616 --> 00:06:38,572
I need to speak with her
right away.

138
00:07:02,429 --> 00:07:03,601
Agent Dunham.

139
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:12,916
<i>Specialist
from Massive Dynamic.</i>

140
00:07:17,057 --> 00:07:19,035
I'll be right with you,
Agent Dunham.

141
00:07:21,214 --> 00:07:24,028
Let's just say this treatment
doesn't fall under an HMO.

142
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:25,931
No.

143
00:07:48,988 --> 00:07:51,198
William Bell
is not the problem,

144
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:52,160
and he's certainly
not the head

145
00:07:52,196 --> 00:07:53,927
of any
terrorist organization.

146
00:07:54,178 --> 00:07:55,389
Well,
I'll make that judgment.

147
00:07:55,513 --> 00:07:56,200
Thank you.

148
00:07:56,331 --> 00:07:58,748
Well, it's true
Jones used to work

149
00:07:58,804 --> 00:08:00,346
for William Bell
15 years ago.

150
00:08:00,402 --> 00:08:02,846
In fact, he was
one of our first employees

151
00:08:02,892 --> 00:08:04,070
at Massive Dynamic.

152
00:08:04,273 --> 00:08:05,845
- But he was let go.
- Why?

153
00:08:05,911 --> 00:08:07,082
<i>The details
are not important.</i>

154
00:08:07,124 --> 00:08:08,375
Suffice to say...

155
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,583
<i>that Jones felt
spurned by the rejection.</i>

156
00:08:11,526 --> 00:08:13,513
William was
a father figure to him,

157
00:08:13,584 --> 00:08:16,205
a respected mentor.

158
00:08:16,724 --> 00:08:19,636
I would go as far as to say that
all the death and destruction

159
00:08:19,681 --> 00:08:21,479
that Jones has caused
up until this point...

160
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:24,867
has been a way of
proving something to William.

161
00:08:25,415 --> 00:08:26,491
To prove what?

162
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:29,348
Jones always felt
that he was special

163
00:08:29,446 --> 00:08:31,223
and that
no one recognized that.

164
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:33,035
Certainly,
not William.

165
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:33,992
So before the shooting,

166
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:36,117
when was the last time
you <i>saw</i> David Jones?

167
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:37,880
Oh, I haven't seen him
for years.

168
00:08:38,362 --> 00:08:39,741
But after
he broke out of prison,

169
00:08:40,746 --> 00:08:42,387
he was contacting
our offices,

170
00:08:42,428 --> 00:08:44,261
requesting meetings
with Dr. Bell.

171
00:08:44,472 --> 00:08:46,804
Over the past few weeks,
his calls have become...

172
00:08:47,055 --> 00:08:47,932
rather extreme.

173
00:08:47,938 --> 00:08:49,919
You've been in contact
with a known felon?

174
00:08:50,028 --> 00:08:51,507
It was
an internal matter.

175
00:08:52,848 --> 00:08:54,650
Clearly, we thought
we could manage this

176
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:55,810
better than we did.

177
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:57,796
<i>Apparently,
Jones is ill,</i>

178
00:08:58,354 --> 00:09:00,808
dying from the teleportation
from his prison break.

179
00:09:01,846 --> 00:09:03,220
Nina believes
Jones' agenda is

180
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:05,020
<i>to kill William Bell
when he finds him.</i>

181
00:09:05,055 --> 00:09:06,164
Then Bell
needs to come in.

182
00:09:06,195 --> 00:09:07,903
We need to put him
into protective custody.

183
00:09:08,034 --> 00:09:10,194
- Not possible.
- Why not? Where is he?

184
00:09:10,755 --> 00:09:11,911
I can't say.

185
00:09:12,444 --> 00:09:13,461
This is ridiculous.

186
00:09:13,495 --> 00:09:14,489
Now, listen to me,
Agent Dunham.

187
00:09:14,524 --> 00:09:16,402
I can't say
because I don't know.

188
00:09:18,102 --> 00:09:20,069
I haven't seen
William Bell for months.

189
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,797
He's been
communicating with me,

190
00:09:21,798 --> 00:09:23,194
strictly electronically.

191
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,326
But what I do know,
though...

192
00:09:26,973 --> 00:09:28,347
is speaking
with William Bell

193
00:09:28,394 --> 00:09:30,850
has become more than
a professional matter for you.

194
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,109
In fact,
I'm counting on that.

195
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:35,829
Stop Jones...

196
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,187
And I will personally
arrange a meeting

197
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,470
between
you and Bell.

198
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,688
But if Jones
gets to Bell first,

199
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,847
I'm afraid all the answers
you're searching for...

200
00:09:49,282 --> 00:09:50,675
die with him.

201
00:09:53,488 --> 00:09:55,198
What did Jones
want from you?

202
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:59,525
What did he do to you
in the elevator?

203
00:10:06,514 --> 00:10:10,683
He stole a very powerful...
energy cell

204
00:10:11,252 --> 00:10:13,457
that Dr. Bell
hid within my arm.

205
00:10:13,816 --> 00:10:15,081
What can he do
with it?

206
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,937
Unfortunately,
the question is...

207
00:10:17,423 --> 00:10:19,121
What <i>can't</i> he do?

208
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:01,586
<i>Oh my God!</i>

209
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,426
- Ah!
- What is that?

210
00:11:07,551 --> 00:11:09,347
<i>Coordinate tracking
is complete, sir.</i>

211
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:11,000
<i>You can
increase sonic frequency.</i>

212
00:11:16,581 --> 00:11:17,577
It's locked in.

213
00:11:26,476 --> 00:11:28,156
Stabilize, damn it.

214
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:36,227
<i>The coordinates
are separating, sir.</i>

215
00:11:37,973 --> 00:11:40,052
<i>It's not working,
they're still separating.</i>

216
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,654
<i>We're losing it.</i>

217
00:11:42,105 --> 00:11:43,175
<i>We can't
hold it open.</i>

218
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:04,467
It's too thick here.

219
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,272
These are
the wrong coordinates.

220
00:12:10,273 --> 00:12:11,813
Try again, please.

221
00:12:26,683 --> 00:12:29,740
S01E20:
There's More Than One of Everything

222
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:02,758
Do you recognize this?

223
00:13:10,654 --> 00:13:11,796
How did you get that?

224
00:13:15,234 --> 00:13:18,068
<i>This coin looks similar
to the one you're thinking of.</i>

225
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:20,684
But it is
from another place.

226
00:13:23,078 --> 00:13:25,109
There is more than one
of everything.

227
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:29,451
I have said
too much,

228
00:13:29,492 --> 00:13:31,148
I am not supposed
to get involved.

229
00:13:34,074 --> 00:13:36,001
I have taken you
as far as I can.

230
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:39,933
<i>Does this house
look familiar to you?</i>

231
00:13:40,082 --> 00:13:41,077
Yes.

232
00:13:43,558 --> 00:13:45,810
Do you remember
what you have to find?

233
00:13:50,806 --> 00:13:52,756
You must
try to remember.

234
00:13:54,989 --> 00:13:56,376
There isn't much time.

235
00:14:29,945 --> 00:14:31,333
<i>Agent Astrid Farnsworth?</i>

236
00:14:32,986 --> 00:14:34,318
I'd like you
to meet Nina Sharp.

237
00:14:37,731 --> 00:14:38,552
Hello.

238
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,365
Uh...
How are you feeling?

239
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,294
The extent of my injuries
was greatly exaggerated.

240
00:14:46,325 --> 00:14:47,523
We wanted to ask you
a few questions

241
00:14:47,558 --> 00:14:48,587
about Dr. Bishop.

242
00:14:49,187 --> 00:14:49,863
Okay.

243
00:14:50,091 --> 00:14:51,829
Has he been acting
strange lately?

244
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:54,160
Walter acting strange,
um...

245
00:14:54,986 --> 00:14:56,476
No stranger than usual.

246
00:14:56,526 --> 00:14:57,805
And did he speak
to anyone,

247
00:14:57,844 --> 00:14:59,526
or has anyone
recently contacted him

248
00:14:59,562 --> 00:15:00,750
that you've
never heard of before?

249
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:02,929
No.
Should I be concerned?

250
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:04,367
Should she be?

251
00:15:04,691 --> 00:15:06,468
Peter, hello.

252
00:15:06,695 --> 00:15:07,465
Ms. Sharp.

253
00:15:07,723 --> 00:15:08,910
So what's going on here?

254
00:15:09,137 --> 00:15:10,495
Agent Dunham told you
about the attack

255
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:11,769
by David Robert Jones?

256
00:15:11,996 --> 00:15:12,392
Yeah.

257
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:13,432
<i>Jones is
in possession</i>

258
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:14,962
of something
your father may...

259
00:15:15,732 --> 00:15:17,232
know something about.

260
00:15:17,701 --> 00:15:20,032
When was the last time
either of you saw Dr. Bishop?

261
00:15:20,313 --> 00:15:21,602
It was last night.
Why?

262
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,348
You think Jones
has something to do

263
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,358
with his disappearance?

264
00:15:24,404 --> 00:15:25,936
Dr. Bishop gets lost,

265
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,618
more often
than you would imagine.

266
00:15:28,188 --> 00:15:29,130
I'm sure you're right.

267
00:15:30,989 --> 00:15:31,879
This is Broyles.

268
00:15:32,086 --> 00:15:35,132
It's me, I need
a priority one grid search.

269
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:37,114
Target is
Walter Bishop.

270
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,366
What the hell happened?

271
00:15:44,303 --> 00:15:45,753
Where's the other half
of the truck?

272
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,602
<i>Suddenly,
there was this...</i>

273
00:15:50,072 --> 00:15:51,027
shimmer,
like a...

274
00:15:51,477 --> 00:15:53,391
a curtain almost,
or a window.

275
00:15:53,442 --> 00:15:55,893
My colleague said
you saw a man with a machine.

276
00:15:56,113 --> 00:15:57,265
<i>Well,
what did it look like?</i>

277
00:15:57,461 --> 00:16:00,195
The man was holding, like,
this black square.

278
00:16:00,266 --> 00:16:01,665
<i>Like it was
scanning something.</i>

279
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,573
This truck, it just--
just came out of nowhere.

280
00:16:03,615 --> 00:16:06,183
It just appeared
like it came through the window,

281
00:16:06,218 --> 00:16:08,748
and what was on the other side
of it was different.

282
00:16:08,845 --> 00:16:11,467
It was emitting this sound,
like a loud noise.

283
00:16:11,646 --> 00:16:12,389
<i>It didn't look
like it was doing</i>

284
00:16:12,428 --> 00:16:15,339
anything, but, um...
It did.

285
00:16:15,385 --> 00:16:16,867
Do you remember
what he looked like?

286
00:16:17,378 --> 00:16:18,861
No, he was
wearing a mask.

287
00:16:19,457 --> 00:16:22,331
Are--Are you sure it was a mask
and not bandages?

288
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:23,732
Yeah,
more like bandages.

289
00:16:34,012 --> 00:16:35,229
<i>Take a look at this.</i>

290
00:16:35,846 --> 00:16:38,296
<i>This image of your father
was taken three hours ago.</i>

291
00:16:38,491 --> 00:16:40,145
Near East Douglas
and Grafton.

292
00:16:41,527 --> 00:16:44,092
Massive Dynamic
maintains access

293
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,596
to all the cameras
we manufacture.

294
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,199
This...
security footage

295
00:16:47,234 --> 00:16:49,140
was from the local
commuter train station.

296
00:16:51,503 --> 00:16:53,870
I think I'm starting
to understand a little better.

297
00:16:54,632 --> 00:16:56,221
This is near a beach house
that we own.

298
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,940
Walter used to love it up there
'cause it's quiet.

299
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:00,244
<i>My father has had</i>

300
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:01,944
a particularly rough
couple of days.

301
00:17:03,101 --> 00:17:03,498
I'm not sure that

302
00:17:03,558 --> 00:17:05,237
everything's making sense
to him right now.

303
00:17:05,612 --> 00:17:08,010
We have agents
canvassing the area.

304
00:17:08,244 --> 00:17:09,084
If you give us
the address--

305
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:10,172
Actually,
if you don't mind...

306
00:17:11,511 --> 00:17:13,708
I'd rather go up there
and bring him back myself.

307
00:17:13,955 --> 00:17:15,497
I think that's
for the best right now.

308
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:16,978
Of course.

309
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:19,960
Thanks.

310
00:17:22,717 --> 00:17:23,838
<i>Agent Francis...</i>

311
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:26,843
The driver died
on impact.

312
00:17:26,974 --> 00:17:28,424
Blunt force trauma
to the head.

313
00:17:28,735 --> 00:17:29,818
That's what we got
so far.

314
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,765
- You sure this is right?
- Yeah.

315
00:17:32,471 --> 00:17:33,171
<i>What?</i>

316
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,246
The prints aren't
coming back on the driver,

317
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:39,430
the, uh,
the truck isn't registered

318
00:17:39,481 --> 00:17:41,673
in New York,
or anywhere else.

319
00:17:41,762 --> 00:17:44,636
The VIN number,
the serial part numbers...

320
00:17:44,953 --> 00:17:46,163
They don't exist.

321
00:17:47,101 --> 00:17:48,132
What does that mean?

322
00:17:49,616 --> 00:17:51,014
This truck
was never made.

323
00:17:52,994 --> 00:17:54,349
How is that possible?

324
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,068
Where the hell
did it come from?

325
00:18:30,946 --> 00:18:31,771
Walter?

326
00:19:21,872 --> 00:19:23,023
Walter?

327
00:19:37,964 --> 00:19:38,945
Hello, Peter.

328
00:19:40,627 --> 00:19:42,002
Walter,
what are you doing here?

329
00:19:42,954 --> 00:19:44,347
You had us worried.

330
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,369
I'm looking for
something.

331
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:53,029
I think it...
It might be in this house.

332
00:19:54,856 --> 00:19:56,430
And it's very important.

333
00:19:57,918 --> 00:19:58,858
Okay.

334
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,971
What are you
looking for?

335
00:20:03,246 --> 00:20:04,999
I just can't recall,
son.

336
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:06,223
That's the thing.

337
00:20:07,378 --> 00:20:09,002
<i>You're not telling us
everything.</i>

338
00:20:09,012 --> 00:20:10,367
If Jones
is looking for Bell,

339
00:20:10,408 --> 00:20:12,322
then what does
an energy cell and a truck

340
00:20:12,352 --> 00:20:14,464
<i>coming from nowhere
have to do with it?</i>

341
00:20:14,515 --> 00:20:16,478
Well, nothing comes out
of nowhere, Agent Dunham.

342
00:20:16,703 --> 00:20:17,891
Then where does
it come from?

343
00:20:17,923 --> 00:20:19,290
I think
you already know that.

344
00:20:19,722 --> 00:20:21,977
And I think you already
suspect where William Bell is.

345
00:20:22,003 --> 00:20:23,787
Are you saying
that you know where Bell is?

346
00:20:25,978 --> 00:20:27,975
Stop playing games
with me.

347
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,123
Tell me where he is,
or I assure you

348
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:32,324
I will turn this world <i>over</i>
looking for him.

349
00:20:36,175 --> 00:20:37,929
Well, that's just the problem,
Agent Dunham.

350
00:20:38,703 --> 00:20:41,465
William Bell
is not <i>in</i> this world.

351
00:21:04,307 --> 00:21:05,988
<i>You're saying that
William Bell</i>

352
00:21:06,374 --> 00:21:08,394
<i>disappeared
into a different universe?</i>

353
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:10,539
Like
Dorothy going to Oz?

354
00:21:10,595 --> 00:21:13,417
Well, Walter calls it
an alternate reality.

355
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:14,695
Do you understand?

356
00:21:14,963 --> 00:21:15,971
Not remotely.

357
00:21:16,321 --> 00:21:17,841
You're saying
that William Bell...

358
00:21:18,212 --> 00:21:19,595
is not
on this planet.

359
00:21:19,636 --> 00:21:20,420
No, he is.

360
00:21:20,455 --> 00:21:22,196
Just another version
of this planet.

361
00:21:22,237 --> 00:21:23,745
Have you had
déjà vu?

362
00:21:23,995 --> 00:21:25,495
Living a moment
you've already lived before?

363
00:21:25,546 --> 00:21:26,363
Yes.

364
00:21:26,581 --> 00:21:29,533
What does déjà vu have to do
with where Bell is?

365
00:21:30,014 --> 00:21:32,551
Well, déjà vu is like
a glimpse into the other side.

366
00:21:32,586 --> 00:21:34,099
You feel like
you've been somewhere before

367
00:21:34,134 --> 00:21:36,949
because actually,
in another reality, you have.

368
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,303
<i>But déjà vu
is just a window.</i>

369
00:21:39,327 --> 00:21:41,523
It's possible some individuals
may be able to do more

370
00:21:41,543 --> 00:21:43,116
than just see
into the other world.

371
00:21:43,918 --> 00:21:45,565
They may
be able to travel there.

372
00:21:45,773 --> 00:21:46,813
So the incident
on the street--

373
00:21:46,837 --> 00:21:48,775
That's why
we can't identify the truck.

374
00:21:49,006 --> 00:21:50,406
Because it came <i>from</i>
the other side.

375
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,077
That's what Jones
is using the energy cell for.

376
00:21:53,253 --> 00:21:54,757
He's trying
to cross over,

377
00:21:54,808 --> 00:21:56,082
to get to Bell.

378
00:21:57,999 --> 00:21:59,014
Broyles.

379
00:21:59,559 --> 00:21:59,903
Dunham.

380
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:01,526
It's Francis.

381
00:22:01,869 --> 00:22:02,702
Where?

382
00:22:06,374 --> 00:22:08,678
Walter, just--
Just calm down.

383
00:22:10,855 --> 00:22:11,850
<i>Yes, Peter.</i>

384
00:22:13,888 --> 00:22:16,446
I started something
a long time ago,

385
00:22:16,481 --> 00:22:18,553
I did--I did,
it's the truth, I did.

386
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:21,715
Walter.

387
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,155
And I have
to finish it.

388
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:23,999
Walter!

389
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,962
- Walter.
- No.

390
00:22:26,618 --> 00:22:27,539
- Damn it.
- <i>I need you to</i>

391
00:22:27,574 --> 00:22:29,201
take a breath
and calm down.

392
00:22:29,237 --> 00:22:30,517
It was
the penthouse.

393
00:22:33,623 --> 00:22:34,398
<i>Walter.</i>

394
00:22:34,431 --> 00:22:35,838
I need you
to take a deep breath.

395
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,039
I can't find it.
I don't know where to look.

396
00:22:41,997 --> 00:22:43,006
I don't know
where to look...

397
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:46,903
Damn it.

398
00:22:47,898 --> 00:22:49,256
I don't know
where to look.

399
00:22:49,302 --> 00:22:51,202
Walter, Walter,
where are you g--

400
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:51,900
Walter!

401
00:22:52,877 --> 00:22:53,899
Where are you going?

402
00:22:54,389 --> 00:22:56,169
Walter, look,
it's getting late.

403
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:57,553
<i>We need
to head back.</i>

404
00:22:57,767 --> 00:22:59,188
No, not yet.

405
00:23:05,722 --> 00:23:06,927
You know,
I remember when we used

406
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,553
to come down here
during the summers.

407
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:11,099
Mom and I.

408
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:14,995
You were always
still working back in the city.

409
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,290
I'd stand out here
on the beach for hours...

410
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,470
Looking at the ocean.

411
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:25,007
Used to seem
like it went on forever.

412
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,065
And on Saturdays...

413
00:23:31,011 --> 00:23:33,439
I'd always wake up
just before my alarm.

414
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,582
I could smell
the pancakes...

415
00:23:39,281 --> 00:23:40,626
Which meant
that you were here.

416
00:23:47,678 --> 00:23:49,558
I'd creep down
the stairs...

417
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:51,862
And there'd you be.

418
00:23:53,775 --> 00:23:56,000
Standing over the stove,
flipping pancakes.

419
00:23:57,653 --> 00:23:59,304
You seemed so big
back then.

420
00:24:01,637 --> 00:24:03,332
I'd just stand there
watching you.

421
00:24:04,938 --> 00:24:05,945
And you'd always...

422
00:24:06,061 --> 00:24:07,617
- flip one of the pancakes.
- <i>Whales.</i>

423
00:24:12,132 --> 00:24:14,076
I made them
in the shape of whales.

424
00:24:15,182 --> 00:24:16,640
They were your favorite!

425
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:17,752
Yes.

426
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,989
Peter,
I remember.

427
00:24:22,678 --> 00:24:23,488
Thank you.

428
00:24:25,233 --> 00:24:26,594
I know
why I'm here.

429
00:24:28,312 --> 00:24:30,265
I know where it is.

430
00:24:34,753 --> 00:24:36,627
<i>Okay, so tell me
exactly what you saw.</i>

431
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,355
I was standing there
by the field.

432
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:40,285
Lance went back,
you know, to get the ball.

433
00:24:40,525 --> 00:24:41,705
That's
when I saw it.

434
00:24:41,932 --> 00:24:43,857
It's like a
see-through wall appeared.

435
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,746
It sort of
shimmered,

436
00:24:45,957 --> 00:24:47,320
like a heat wave,
you know?

437
00:24:47,824 --> 00:24:49,664
Like something was there,
but it wasn't.

438
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,951
What do you mean
it was there and it wasn't?

439
00:24:52,386 --> 00:24:53,979
It was
like a window,

440
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,580
but warped.

441
00:24:55,945 --> 00:24:56,891
Then it shut.

442
00:24:57,254 --> 00:24:58,433
Thank you.

443
00:25:00,311 --> 00:25:00,962
Hey.

444
00:25:01,348 --> 00:25:02,030
Okay.

445
00:25:02,691 --> 00:25:04,507
So him and his friend
are playing soccer.

446
00:25:04,707 --> 00:25:06,115
The kid's running
with the ball,

447
00:25:06,499 --> 00:25:08,594
when all of a sudden,
they see this shimmer of light.

448
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:10,039
The kid
hits the shimmer,

449
00:25:10,253 --> 00:25:12,668
and then he just,
sort of collapses.

450
00:25:12,753 --> 00:25:14,915
- And did anyone see Jones?
- No.

451
00:25:15,735 --> 00:25:17,133
But there's
a bit more to go.

452
00:25:17,377 --> 00:25:18,697
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

453
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,201
<i>How does something
like that happen?</i>

454
00:25:24,563 --> 00:25:26,442
I can't believe
I'm gonna be saying this.

455
00:25:27,104 --> 00:25:30,259
Let's assume
that Jones is trying to...

456
00:25:30,294 --> 00:25:32,238
make this doorway
into another universe.

457
00:25:32,273 --> 00:25:33,129
Why here?

458
00:25:33,405 --> 00:25:34,930
I mean, first New York,
now here.

459
00:25:34,958 --> 00:25:36,383
What do they have
in common?

460
00:25:51,836 --> 00:25:52,995
Hey Chad,
what you got?

461
00:25:53,041 --> 00:25:54,733
Third floor says
they can't find a connection

462
00:25:54,774 --> 00:25:56,195
between the incident
in New York and the

463
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,244
- <i>one on the soccer field.</i>
- Yeah, I know.

464
00:25:57,339 --> 00:25:57,819
I know.

465
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,667
Look, I want you
to go through our database,

466
00:25:59,733 --> 00:26:01,786
and cross-reference
any incidents connected

467
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:04,964
to science, biology,
or unexplained phenomenon

468
00:26:05,035 --> 00:26:07,632
and have the file
sent to my office, please.

469
00:26:08,314 --> 00:26:09,555
Dating back how far?

470
00:26:10,616 --> 00:26:11,506
All of them.

471
00:26:14,696 --> 00:26:16,436
Uh, just put them
down there, thank you.

472
00:26:18,723 --> 00:26:20,491
You can roll
that one into the corner.

473
00:27:00,482 --> 00:27:02,860
Sir, we need
to call Nina Sharp.

474
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,249
I think that
I found a connection between

475
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:05,685
what Jones did
in New York

476
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,627
and that park
in Providence.

477
00:27:15,348 --> 00:27:17,293
Walter, tell me
what you're looking for.

478
00:27:23,226 --> 00:27:24,548
Here.
I got it.

479
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:28,757
Oh!
It's still here.

480
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:30,520
I was beginning
to be afraid--

481
00:27:47,088 --> 00:27:48,060
Here.

482
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:50,098
This is
why we're here.

483
00:27:55,735 --> 00:27:56,699
It's locked.

484
00:27:56,734 --> 00:27:59,176
<i>This is a record
of all local incidents</i>

485
00:27:59,237 --> 00:28:00,297
<i>related
to the Pattern.</i>

486
00:28:00,404 --> 00:28:02,306
Some of these
go back more than 20 years.

487
00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:04,769
But we've done this ourselves
at Massive Dynamic.

488
00:28:04,838 --> 00:28:06,076
A dozen
of our top analysts

489
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:07,401
have spent the better part
of two years--

490
00:28:07,424 --> 00:28:09,785
Yeah, and there's
seemingly no obvious logic

491
00:28:09,841 --> 00:28:11,069
or predictability.

492
00:28:11,235 --> 00:28:13,143
It took me a while
to see it myself.

493
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,329
But...

494
00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:19,259
These are the spots
where Jones used his device.

495
00:28:20,143 --> 00:28:21,318
Now look at this.

496
00:28:27,142 --> 00:28:28,888
<i>That can't be
a coincidence.</i>

497
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:30,756
So what does it mean?

498
00:28:30,837 --> 00:28:32,651
I think
I may know.

499
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:37,358
Got it.

500
00:28:45,032 --> 00:28:46,381
What exactly is that?

501
00:28:47,723 --> 00:28:49,553
When Belly and I
were younger men,

502
00:28:50,547 --> 00:28:54,444
we regularly ingested
large quantities of LSD.

503
00:28:55,057 --> 00:28:55,807
You don't say?

504
00:28:55,983 --> 00:28:57,924
We became convinced
what we saw

505
00:28:58,022 --> 00:28:59,348
while on the drug
was real.

506
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:01,270
We believed
that we were

507
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:04,149
catching glimpses
of another reality.

508
00:29:04,241 --> 00:29:06,391
Another world
just like ours...

509
00:29:07,095 --> 00:29:08,341
But slightly different,

510
00:29:09,485 --> 00:29:13,602
Populated by slightly
different versions of ourselves.

511
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:16,546
We all experience it
momentarily as déjà vu.

512
00:29:16,709 --> 00:29:19,681
And Belly and I could prolong it
with hallucinogenics.

513
00:29:19,876 --> 00:29:21,562
But the question
of course was:

514
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:25,687
How to get there
without LSD?

515
00:29:25,804 --> 00:29:28,182
Belly, as you know,
theorized that young children

516
00:29:28,509 --> 00:29:32,277
have the capacity to see
these other worlds naturally.

517
00:29:32,483 --> 00:29:34,024
I know, you already
told me about that.

518
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:36,384
Bell's experiments
with Cortexiphan.

519
00:29:36,536 --> 00:29:37,060
<i>Yes.</i>

520
00:29:37,111 --> 00:29:38,942
He theorized
that properly nurtured,

521
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:40,719
these abilities
could be heightened,

522
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:41,950
intensified,

523
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,723
and that in time,
his subjects may be able

524
00:29:44,758 --> 00:29:47,338
<i>may be able to travel
from here to there.</i>

525
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,414
Over there?

526
00:29:50,024 --> 00:29:51,572
You mean
an alternate world?

527
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:58,033
Around this time,

528
00:29:58,968 --> 00:30:01,276
something was lost
to me, Peter.

529
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:03,431
Something precious.

530
00:30:03,994 --> 00:30:08,576
I became convinced that
if only I could cross over myself,

531
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:12,842
then I could <i>take</i> from there
what I had lost here.

532
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:14,789
And what was
the plan?

533
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:15,898
You were just gonna
open up a hole

534
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,310
and then walk over
to the other side?

535
00:30:17,405 --> 00:30:19,928
No...
It's not that simple.

536
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:23,330
You have to find
the right place first.

537
00:30:24,812 --> 00:30:25,987
<i>Finding the right place</i>

538
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,740
<i>to cross over
is the key.</i>

539
00:30:27,775 --> 00:30:31,886
Dr. Bell once posited
that our world has "soft spots,"

540
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,525
<i>places where the fundamental
constants of nature--</i>

541
00:30:34,562 --> 00:30:36,897
The speed of light,
gravity,

542
00:30:37,106 --> 00:30:39,208
The mass of a proton,
for example,

543
00:30:39,396 --> 00:30:40,851
have begun
to decay.

544
00:30:41,859 --> 00:30:44,477
As a result,
in these particular areas,

545
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:47,683
<i>the membrane between
the realities is thinner,</i>

546
00:30:47,724 --> 00:30:49,004
almost porous.

547
00:30:49,543 --> 00:30:51,935
Well, the Bermuda Triangle
is one,

548
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,027
<i>but there are others.</i>

549
00:30:53,062 --> 00:30:54,210
<i>And until recently,</i>

550
00:30:54,408 --> 00:30:56,695
these areas
were extremely rare.

551
00:30:57,396 --> 00:30:58,584
What do you mean
"until recently"?

552
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,432
What happened?

553
00:30:59,622 --> 00:31:01,385
We happened,
Agent Dunham.

554
00:31:01,863 --> 00:31:04,236
Scientific progress,
advancing technologies.

555
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:06,197
By meddling
with the laws of nature,

556
00:31:06,228 --> 00:31:09,238
has hastened the decay
of these constant fundamentals

557
00:31:09,292 --> 00:31:11,781
and increased
the number of soft spots.

558
00:31:12,314 --> 00:31:13,832
So you're suggesting
Jones is looking

559
00:31:13,868 --> 00:31:15,043
for one of these
soft spots.

560
00:31:15,094 --> 00:31:15,762
Yes.

561
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,845
In the belief that by releasing
the right kind of energy,

562
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:22,119
and aiming it exactly
at the proper spot,

563
00:31:23,108 --> 00:31:25,107
he could effectively
break through.

564
00:31:25,876 --> 00:31:27,101
<i>Of course,
there's a problem</i>

565
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:28,898
<i>opening a hole
to another reality.</i>

566
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:33,745
In theory, that would
also allow things from there

567
00:31:33,848 --> 00:31:35,502
to pass over here,

568
00:31:37,198 --> 00:31:39,001
which could be
dangerous.

569
00:31:40,138 --> 00:31:43,680
And so,
I also built a plug.

570
00:31:44,142 --> 00:31:45,046
A plug?

571
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:47,477
Actually,
more a patch

572
00:31:49,202 --> 00:31:51,827
to close the hole
should the need ever arise.

573
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,326
This is that patch,
Peter.

574
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,599
This is
what I had to find.

575
00:31:54,634 --> 00:31:55,902
Okay,
just so I'm clear.

576
00:31:56,732 --> 00:32:00,363
Somewhere out there, there is
a hole to another reality,

577
00:32:00,373 --> 00:32:01,496
and you need
to plug it?

578
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:02,613
Yes,
I'm afraid so.

579
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:04,373
Well, do you know
where it is?

580
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:05,740
Yes.

581
00:32:06,762 --> 00:32:07,767
Yes,
I do, Peter.

582
00:32:09,308 --> 00:32:10,977
Reiden.
Reiden Lake.

583
00:32:11,393 --> 00:32:13,209
<i>We have to identify
another soft spot,</i>

584
00:32:13,275 --> 00:32:14,643
then we'll know
where he's going.

585
00:32:14,702 --> 00:32:16,295
We should expand
the search perimeters.

586
00:32:16,454 --> 00:32:18,338
Did you map events
beyond the eastern seaboard?

587
00:32:18,582 --> 00:32:19,767
No,
they're not in our database.

588
00:32:19,802 --> 00:32:20,601
I'll call my office

589
00:32:20,636 --> 00:32:22,412
and have the files
transferred to your system.

590
00:32:22,537 --> 00:32:24,260
Which of these events
are the oldest?

591
00:32:24,477 --> 00:32:25,360
Do you remember?

592
00:32:26,316 --> 00:32:28,848
I mean,
these events are somehow

593
00:32:28,853 --> 00:32:30,862
consequences
of soft spots--

594
00:32:31,022 --> 00:32:31,580
Well...

595
00:32:33,206 --> 00:32:35,045
These are
the first recorded incidents.

596
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:38,162
They all go back
more than 15 years.

597
00:32:38,992 --> 00:32:40,026
Becca's Meadow...

598
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,839
<i>That was the site
of the first incident</i>

599
00:32:41,885 --> 00:32:42,904
<i>we know about.</i>

600
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:46,787
Wait...

601
00:32:47,964 --> 00:32:50,427
All of these incidents
point to here.

602
00:32:50,745 --> 00:32:51,943
That's where
he's going.

603
00:32:53,396 --> 00:32:54,943
Reiden Lake.

604
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:01,015
Get all the gear,
get set up.

605
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,155
Come on, men.

606
00:33:16,326 --> 00:33:17,894
We're going
to the other side.

607
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:28,109
It's just
the other side of the lake.

608
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:30,483
<i>The place where
I opened the hole.</i>

609
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,501
That's awfully
convenient.

610
00:33:33,892 --> 00:33:35,224
Not convenient
at all.

611
00:33:35,259 --> 00:33:35,942
That's why I bought

612
00:33:35,997 --> 00:33:37,496
the beach house
in the first place.

613
00:33:37,906 --> 00:33:38,796
The proximity.

614
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,577
Come on, Peter.
Can't you go faster?

615
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,106
We may not have
much time.

616
00:33:43,158 --> 00:33:43,907
After all
these years,

617
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,533
what's going to happen
if we're not <i>on</i> time?

618
00:33:45,621 --> 00:33:46,767
I don't know!

619
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,305
But my friend came
and he said we must.

620
00:33:50,521 --> 00:33:52,649
He only comes when
it's of dire consequence.

621
00:33:52,705 --> 00:33:54,023
And what friend
would that be?

622
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,468
The bald one.

623
00:33:56,251 --> 00:33:58,498
You mean the one that
Olivia calls 'The Observer'?

624
00:33:58,545 --> 00:33:59,225
Yes.

625
00:33:59,462 --> 00:34:01,240
The man who attacked me
in the woods.

626
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,799
He must've
had a very good reason.

627
00:34:03,369 --> 00:34:05,084
I'm sure he didn't mean you
any harm.

628
00:34:05,171 --> 00:34:06,974
What else aren't
you telling me, Walter?

629
00:34:07,558 --> 00:34:08,906
Lots,
I'm sure,

630
00:34:09,175 --> 00:34:10,780
but none of it
is relevant.

631
00:34:11,972 --> 00:34:15,354
Can't--it's been so long.
This all looks the same.

632
00:34:15,862 --> 00:34:18,256
Oh...
Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter.

633
00:34:18,312 --> 00:34:18,760
Peter!

634
00:34:18,795 --> 00:34:19,769
<i>Stop it!
Stop!</i>

635
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,624
Okay.

636
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,621
Now what?

637
00:34:38,965 --> 00:34:40,741
That thing's not going
to blow up, is it?

638
00:34:42,431 --> 00:34:43,767
I certainly
hope not.

639
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:48,123
What?

640
00:34:51,565 --> 00:34:53,223
You may not
remember this.

641
00:34:53,442 --> 00:34:54,349
When you were
a boy,

642
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,102
- you were very sick, dying.
- Walter.

643
00:34:56,258 --> 00:34:57,794
And sometimes,
you got scared.

644
00:34:58,016 --> 00:34:59,944
And to calm yourself,

645
00:35:00,568 --> 00:35:02,098
to forget what you were
going through,

646
00:35:02,174 --> 00:35:04,535
you took
to collecting coins.

647
00:35:06,189 --> 00:35:06,918
This one...

648
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,904
This was
your favorite.

649
00:35:16,363 --> 00:35:17,111
You're right.

650
00:35:18,012 --> 00:35:19,231
I don't remember
any of that.

651
00:35:21,713 --> 00:35:22,907
I do.

652
00:35:26,954 --> 00:35:28,053
Walter!

653
00:35:31,831 --> 00:35:33,137
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Easy, easy.

654
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,531
- Take it easy.
- <i>Hey, they're with me.</i>

655
00:35:34,595 --> 00:35:35,639
- Easy, easy.
- It's okay.

656
00:35:37,324 --> 00:35:38,537
Agent Dunham...

657
00:35:38,771 --> 00:35:39,980
H-How did you know
where we were?

658
00:35:39,996 --> 00:35:41,267
What are you
doing here?

659
00:35:41,413 --> 00:35:43,333
We're trying to plug a hole
in the universe.

660
00:35:43,369 --> 00:35:44,499
What are you
doing here?

661
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,849
- Apparently the same thing.
- But how did you--

662
00:35:49,251 --> 00:35:50,411
<i>Oh no.</i>

663
00:35:52,165 --> 00:35:53,130
What is that?

664
00:36:22,435 --> 00:36:23,769
Dr. Bishop,
stay down.

665
00:36:26,431 --> 00:36:29,094
Keep going please.
Don't stop what you're doing.

666
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:31,174
<i>Hold them off
as long as you can.</i>

667
00:36:33,503 --> 00:36:34,852
Olivia,
I'll cover you.

668
00:36:38,876 --> 00:36:41,305
Walter!
Hey, Walter, stay here.

669
00:36:41,341 --> 00:36:43,053
They'll need this
to close the portal,

670
00:36:43,102 --> 00:36:44,549
to prevent him
from going over.

671
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:45,663
Give it to me.
I'll do it.

672
00:36:46,383 --> 00:36:47,582
- Give it to me!
- Okay.

673
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:48,200
All right.

674
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,429
It's simple,
a child could do it.

675
00:36:50,596 --> 00:36:52,537
You just twist this.

676
00:37:00,649 --> 00:37:01,777
<i>What's the status?</i>

677
00:37:03,501 --> 00:37:05,285
<i>Coordinates
are coming into place, sir.</i>

678
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,688
We're almost there,
sir.

679
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:11,624
Jones?

680
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:18,760
Don't move.

681
00:37:19,706 --> 00:37:21,444
Manifold is stable.

682
00:37:21,613 --> 00:37:22,480
Don't move.

683
00:37:29,438 --> 00:37:31,689
Stop!
Don't move.

684
00:37:33,007 --> 00:37:34,256
Beautiful,
isn't it?

685
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,990
<i>You'll understand
if this reunion is brief.</i>

686
00:37:38,062 --> 00:37:40,293
If you take one more step,
I'll shoot.

687
00:37:40,529 --> 00:37:41,957
Goodbye,
Agent Dunham.

688
00:37:42,121 --> 00:37:42,643
Don't!

689
00:37:55,963 --> 00:37:57,133
The teleporter...

690
00:37:58,654 --> 00:38:00,644
It may be killing me,
but in the meantime,

691
00:38:01,825 --> 00:38:04,104
It's made me something
rather special.

692
00:38:04,678 --> 00:38:07,994
<i>You see, your bullets
just go right through me.</i>

693
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:11,878
And soon Dr. Bell will see
just how special I am.

694
00:38:17,626 --> 00:38:18,826
- Stop!
- Dunham!

695
00:38:51,494 --> 00:38:52,408
Hey.

696
00:38:54,795 --> 00:38:55,592
Hey.

697
00:38:58,647 --> 00:39:00,614
Under normal circumstances,
I would ask you

698
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:02,037
when I could expect
your report.

699
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,001
But in this case, I find myself
at a bit of a loss.

700
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:07,929
How is Nina?

701
00:39:08,002 --> 00:39:09,102
She's doing fine.

702
00:39:10,067 --> 00:39:11,853
She wanted me
to convey her gratitude.

703
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,623
What?

704
00:39:18,339 --> 00:39:19,777
We've been told
to cease and desist

705
00:39:19,823 --> 00:39:21,630
our investigation
into William Bell.

706
00:39:21,888 --> 00:39:22,916
By whom?

707
00:39:23,347 --> 00:39:25,155
The kind of people that
when they give you an order,

708
00:39:25,211 --> 00:39:26,383
you don't question it.

709
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,752
I'm sorry.

710
00:39:38,223 --> 00:39:39,272
Dr. Bishop...

711
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,890
Good news.

712
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:43,990
I got you
some berry boom.

713
00:39:48,099 --> 00:39:48,802
<i>Hey.</i>

714
00:39:49,674 --> 00:39:50,408
What's wrong?

715
00:40:10,078 --> 00:40:11,461
"I'm stepping out
for a bit.

716
00:40:11,892 --> 00:40:14,040
Don't worry about me, son.
I know where I'm going."

717
00:40:16,135 --> 00:40:17,375
You want me
to call the police?

718
00:40:21,663 --> 00:40:22,452
No.

719
00:40:26,206 --> 00:40:28,448
That is the first time
he's ever written a note.

720
00:40:30,334 --> 00:40:32,128
I think our little boy
is growing up.

721
00:41:31,356 --> 00:41:31,962
Hello?

722
00:41:32,265 --> 00:41:34,739
<i>Agent Dunham,
it's Nina Sharp.</i>

723
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:36,156
<i>You held up
your end of the bargain.</i>

724
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:37,948
<i>Now,
I'd like to hold up mine.</i>

725
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:40,001
<i>Would you mind coming
to Manhattan tomorrow?</i>

726
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:40,786
Sure.

727
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:43,142
<i>Do you know the Mutsumi Hotel
on Broadway?</i>

728
00:41:43,714 --> 00:41:44,330
Yes.

729
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:46,249
<i>Great.
Tomorrow it is, then.</i>

730
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:49,061
<i>I hope you understand
why I can't go through channels.</i>

731
00:41:49,282 --> 00:41:51,481
<i>And I appreciate it
if you didn't tell anyone</i>

732
00:41:51,512 --> 00:41:52,528
<i>about this either.</i>

733
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,832
<i>I don't mean
to sound overly cautious,</i>

734
00:41:54,867 --> 00:41:57,129
<i>but I think
you'll soon understand</i>

735
00:41:57,205 --> 00:41:59,260
<i>why we'll want
to keep this between us.</i>

736
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:00,919
<i>Let's say 1:00?</i>

737
00:42:01,131 --> 00:42:02,130
<i>Come alone.</i>

738
00:42:02,484 --> 00:42:04,116
<i>I'll answer
any questions you have.</i>

739
00:42:25,759 --> 00:42:26,735
No,
thank you.

740
00:42:43,286 --> 00:42:44,399
Uh, Nina Sharp?

741
00:42:45,788 --> 00:42:47,159
Olivia Dunham.

742
00:42:51,167 --> 00:42:52,656
Uh, no, I don't want
to leave a message.

743
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,085
She's expecting
my call.

744
00:42:57,212 --> 00:42:59,309
What do you mean
she's out of the country?

745
00:43:58,164 --> 00:43:59,540
Agent Dunham,
welcome.

746
00:44:00,859 --> 00:44:01,695
Right this way.

747
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:11,269
Go right in.

748
00:45:01,831 --> 00:45:04,586
I've been waiting
quite a long time for this.

749
00:45:07,124 --> 00:45:08,163
Where am I?

750
00:45:11,112 --> 00:45:12,138
Who are you?

751
00:45:12,894 --> 00:45:15,309
The answer
to your first question is--

752
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,172
It's very complicated.

753
00:45:19,941 --> 00:45:21,526
The answer
to your second...

754
00:45:23,817 --> 00:45:25,368
I'm William Bell.
