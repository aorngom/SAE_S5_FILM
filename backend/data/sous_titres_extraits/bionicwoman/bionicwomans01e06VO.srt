1
00:00:00,223 --> 00:00:02,095
Previously on bionic woman

2
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:05,590
What is going on Jaime
Just tell me, OK, I need know.

3
00:00:05,628 --> 00:00:06,415
I can`t

4
00:00:06,446 --> 00:00:07,463
What's this?

5
00:00:07,539 --> 00:00:09,435
Sudent ID. You're going to college.

6
00:00:09,498 --> 00:00:11,960
- The transfer student from oxford.
- The merciful T.A.

7
00:00:12,037 --> 00:00:13,532
Tom Gilchrist.

8
00:00:13,578 --> 00:00:15,802
Can I interest you in a tasty beverage?

9
00:00:16,556 --> 00:00:18,720
I'll be right back

10
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:26,360
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

11
00:00:26,436 --> 00:00:27,891
I asked you first.

12
00:00:27,997 --> 00:00:30,880
You're frickin'F. B. I, aren't you?
You supposed to leave this to us.

13
00:00:30,918 --> 00:00:32,512
What? Are you like a CIA agent?

14
00:00:32,572 --> 00:00:35,930
- Well, what the hell are you?
- I'm with the Berkut group.

15
00:00:36,723 --> 00:00:37,959
They're making the drop.

16
00:00:38,048 --> 00:00:40,414
All right, I'll go down.
You stay up here and cover me.

17
00:00:40,475 --> 00:00:42,068
Don't underestimate me.

18
00:00:48,998 --> 00:00:50,696
- You all right?
- Yeah.

19
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:54,790
Not a good idea.

20
00:00:55,668 --> 00:00:57,455
What about you?
What's your story?

21
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:00,507
It's my last night at college.
Can we just hang out?

22
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:24,365
$250,000 cash.

23
00:01:24,424 --> 00:01:26,295
Walking around money.

24
00:01:26,405 --> 00:01:29,487
Five million in bearer bonds.

25
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,362
As requested.

26
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,037
I've done my part.

27
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,256
Where's the list?

28
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,178
Right, the list.

29
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,093
Move move move!

30
00:02:04,994 --> 00:02:06,133
hurry

31
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:07,651
move move move!

32
00:02:09,527 --> 00:02:11,686
This one's still alive.

33
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,577
Get the chopper down. I want
him alive and brought to berkut.

34
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:17,651
Bring it in.

35
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:18,766
Copy that.

36
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,527
He is? Okay, excellent.

37
00:02:48,646 --> 00:02:50,830
Wait, did you mention me?

38
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,214
What did he say?

39
00:02:53,351 --> 00:02:55,435
Really? Shut up.

40
00:02:56,224 --> 00:02:58,075
Yeah, tonight at 8:00.

41
00:02:58,189 --> 00:02:59,916
Okay, all right, see you then.

42
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:03,504
Guess who's coming over tonight
for tarantino movie night?

43
00:03:03,608 --> 00:03:04,963
- Brennan.
- Brennan.

44
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:08,388
- Actually, I think I'm gonna call him.
- No, you are not calling him.

45
00:03:08,462 --> 00:03:10,750
Rule number one, let him call you.

46
00:03:10,874 --> 00:03:13,488
Rule number one? Come on.

47
00:03:13,595 --> 00:03:15,730
There are a list of rules,
and they are ironclad.

48
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:17,365
Oh, the list of rules.

49
00:03:17,451 --> 00:03:19,320
Okay, I cannot believe
you read that book.

50
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:20,975
It is seriously anti-feminist.

51
00:03:21,084 --> 00:03:23,377
I'm just saying calling a
guy is the kiss of death.

52
00:03:23,466 --> 00:03:25,268
Even if you thought you
spent an incredible,

53
00:03:25,387 --> 00:03:26,995
meaningful night with somebody,

54
00:03:27,084 --> 00:03:30,140
and they follow that up with
eight days of stone cold silence.

55
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,873
What are you talking about?

56
00:03:31,947 --> 00:03:33,265
The rules.

57
00:03:33,376 --> 00:03:35,660
Let him take the lead. Rule five.

58
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:38,267
Be mysterious. Rule six.

59
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:40,630
And don't ever split
the check. Rule ten.

60
00:03:41,825 --> 00:03:45,002
I mean, am I allowed to
vote our own property?

61
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:49,404
I'm trusting you and your
friends to have a good night, okay?

62
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,699
No smoking, no drinking, no driving.

63
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,564
And more importantly,
no calling brennan.

64
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:58,562
Okay, you are seriously
way behind the times

65
00:04:03,304 --> 00:04:05,790
you should have a word with him.

66
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:22,469
I understand you
worked for Victor Booth.

67
00:04:24,568 --> 00:04:26,499
I also understand...

68
00:04:26,619 --> 00:04:29,433
you have a wife, children.

69
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,574
The last thing you would want is
for something to happen to them.

70
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,835
What'd you find out?

71
00:04:40,938 --> 00:04:44,109
The sale is set up at the
sahrawi embassy in paris.

72
00:04:45,107 --> 00:04:47,160
Put a team together.

73
00:04:48,217 --> 00:04:51,016
This is the last known
photograph of Victor Booth.

74
00:04:51,135 --> 00:04:52,465
Who's Victor Booth?

75
00:04:52,549 --> 00:04:54,202
He's an arms dealer, among other things.

76
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,718
Doesn't seem to have
any permanent address.

77
00:04:56,822 --> 00:04:59,078
Multiple reconstructive
surgeries. Uses decoys.

78
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:01,778
Doesn't get photographed, so
nobody knows what he looks like.

79
00:05:01,838 --> 00:05:05,270
That image is eight years old. The only
thing about it is we can see the eyes.

80
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:07,410
What does Berkut want with him?

81
00:05:08,568 --> 00:05:10,550
Killed one of my men last night.

82
00:05:12,081 --> 00:05:15,830
Our operative was set up as a
buyer for a list we really need.

83
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,693
Somehow victor got wind
of the fact that he was berkut.

84
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:20,225
He killed him and left the cash.

85
00:05:20,301 --> 00:05:22,370
Which was smart, 'cause
the bills were traceable.

86
00:05:22,445 --> 00:05:24,373
We've since learned he's
set up another buyer.

87
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,936
Learned from who?

88
00:05:27,991 --> 00:05:29,679
The CIA.

89
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:31,668
I thought CIA and
Berkut hated each other.

90
00:05:31,742 --> 00:05:35,413
We do, but in this case, we're forced to
work together. We need victor's list.

91
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,095
What's on the list?

92
00:05:37,214 --> 00:05:39,751
The identities of CIA
and Berkut operatives.

93
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,580
Now, intel says Victor's
on his way to Paris.

94
00:05:43,607 --> 00:05:45,275
Given the nature of the situation,

95
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:48,386
CIA's gonna insist that we
send somebody in there with you.

96
00:05:48,476 --> 00:05:51,185
So I'm going to paris with a CIA agent.

97
00:05:51,275 --> 00:05:53,150
- That's right.
- Can I pick who?

98
00:05:53,612 --> 00:05:55,250
This isn't a kickball game, Jaime.

99
00:05:55,309 --> 00:05:57,810
I just thought that, you know,
since time is of the essence,

100
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,983
it'd be good to skip the
getting to know you part

101
00:06:00,058 --> 00:06:01,561
and just hit the ground running.

102
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:04,023
Tom Gilchrist and I seemed
to get the job done last week.

103
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,363
Okay, you wanna call him?

104
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,080
No, you go ahead. I don't call guys.

105
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,735
You're missing the point, jaime.

106
00:06:24,847 --> 00:06:27,747
Really? 'cause I think
I just kicked your ass.

107
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,961
Discretion. You have to be able to
neutralize the enemy in public

108
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,000
without anyone ever seeing.

109
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:38,445
Once you're exposed to the world,
you'll lose all value as a weapon.

110
00:06:38,549 --> 00:06:40,262
You know what I love most?

111
00:06:40,321 --> 00:06:42,465
Being referred to as a weapon.

112
00:06:48,353 --> 00:06:49,716
You all right?

113
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,279
hi.

114
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,207
- Tom.
- Jae.

115
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,440
Good luck.

116
00:07:06,444 --> 00:07:07,874
Long time.

117
00:07:07,978 --> 00:07:09,370
Nine days.

118
00:07:09,995 --> 00:07:11,559
So you ready for paris?

119
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:13,899
Yep.

120
00:07:14,763 --> 00:07:16,698
By the way, thanks for
calling me out in this.

121
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:19,130
Oh, I didn't call you. Jonas called you.

122
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,800
Okay, so here's the plan. When we
land in De Gaulle, we gotta move fast.

123
00:07:26,859 --> 00:07:29,185
Oh, De Gaulle, ha ha.

124
00:07:29,301 --> 00:07:32,540
I hate Paris. If I'm being honest,
I just... I don't get the allure.

125
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:34,156
I've never been.

126
00:07:34,244 --> 00:07:35,574
You haven't?

127
00:07:35,636 --> 00:07:38,477
Oh, It's the most romantic place
in the world. You're gonna love it.

128
00:07:38,552 --> 00:07:39,906
- Really.
- Yeah, romantic.

129
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:41,663
My parents took me there when I was 12.

130
00:07:41,783 --> 00:07:45,340
15 churches and five museums
in one day. Gun, mouth.

131
00:07:45,477 --> 00:07:47,342
The Louvre, don't do it to yourself.

132
00:07:47,447 --> 00:07:50,485
- Can we concentrate on the case?
- Let's get down to it.

133
00:07:50,574 --> 00:07:53,274
All right, Jae, you and I will
take Nathan to the safe house

134
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,645
and we'll set up shop with
the rest of the CIA team.

135
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,820
Meanwhile, you're gonna assume your
cover and check into the hotel.

136
00:07:59,275 --> 00:08:01,055
How did Berkut find Victor?

137
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,739
Last week, one of our top
operatives made contact.

138
00:08:04,828 --> 00:08:06,920
He was killed trying to buy the list.

139
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:09,235
Victor means business.
He sold names before.

140
00:08:09,343 --> 00:08:11,508
The three operatives on
the last list were all dead

141
00:08:11,613 --> 00:08:13,698
48 hours after it was sold.

142
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:17,450
And if our intel is correct,
there's over 100 names on this list.

143
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:20,642
Which means we're talking about
not only american security,

144
00:08:20,746 --> 00:08:24,162
but the immediate safetyof over 100
men and women and their families.

145
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,760
So if we can get those names,
we can protect those people.

146
00:08:26,827 --> 00:08:28,718
So is the sale definitely
going down tonight?

147
00:08:28,786 --> 00:08:31,382
The one thing that we know for
sure is it's happening tonight.

148
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:35,100
And we need to get a positive id on
victor from among 200 to 300 guests.

149
00:08:35,218 --> 00:08:39,180
So you two have to eye make contact
as many eurotrash toolbags as you can.

150
00:08:39,439 --> 00:08:41,522
And we'll take care of
the rest at the safehouse.

151
00:08:41,627 --> 00:08:43,005
Bring victor into custody

152
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:45,796
and we keep the list from
getting into enemy hands.

153
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:47,865
Let's go do it.

154
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,503
Sounds good.

155
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,020
Hey, let's keep it professional,
you two, huh?

156
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,890
you ever seen breathless?

157
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:11,465
- Jean-luc Goddard?
- No.

158
00:09:11,587 --> 00:09:14,650
I bet you haven't seen a
single movie made before 1983.

159
00:09:14,743 --> 00:09:15,975
The breakfast club?

160
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:19,314
Thanks for playing. We have
some lovely parting gifts.

161
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,800
We need two rooms.

162
00:09:42,311 --> 00:09:44,959
- I was in turkmenistan...
- I didn't know you spoke french.

163
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:47,356
- No, no, you go ahead.
- That's why I didn't call.

164
00:09:47,431 --> 00:09:49,605
Bad service? Who's your carrier?

165
00:09:49,694 --> 00:09:51,266
I know. It sounds lame, doesn't it?

166
00:09:51,406 --> 00:09:53,160
No, no, it sounds really important.

167
00:09:53,267 --> 00:09:54,965
Well, it was important.

168
00:09:55,098 --> 00:09:56,925
But you understand that, right?

169
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,221
Saving lives, national
security, that kind of thing.

170
00:09:59,281 --> 00:10:01,871
I mean, you're in the game too, right?

171
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,449
Sure.

172
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:11,195
I gather I'm madame lodato.

173
00:10:11,316 --> 00:10:13,635
Does that make me your wife or your mom?

174
00:10:13,742 --> 00:10:16,040
My very chic wife. I'm a lucky man.

175
00:10:16,214 --> 00:10:18,649
Oh, I almost forgot.

176
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,080
You all right?

177
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:30,727
Yep.

178
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,285
Look at the view!

179
00:10:48,425 --> 00:10:50,345
Yeah, it's great, right?

180
00:10:50,435 --> 00:10:54,404
Well, since we're a married couple, we
should just watch tv and not have sex.

181
00:10:54,991 --> 00:10:56,390
That's a great idea.

182
00:10:57,953 --> 00:11:00,027
I wonder if they have deal or no deal.

183
00:11:00,132 --> 00:11:01,948
Say it in french.

184
00:11:14,281 --> 00:11:16,291
Um, you know...

185
00:11:16,737 --> 00:11:20,124
You don't have to worry.
I'll... I'll just...

186
00:11:20,214 --> 00:11:24,174
I'll sleep on the couch.
I think that's a better idea.

187
00:11:33,546 --> 00:11:35,805
Bonjour, mi ami.

188
00:11:35,951 --> 00:11:38,199
What's up, Jae!

189
00:11:38,288 --> 00:11:40,295
- Comment c'est va, everybody?
- Nathan.

190
00:11:40,432 --> 00:11:43,946
Wow, they're not very
friendly. This the french CIA?

191
00:11:44,065 --> 00:11:45,635
Wait till you meet their handler.

192
00:11:45,732 --> 00:11:48,516
All right, I installed
the iris recognition software

193
00:11:48,636 --> 00:11:50,420
I got from my friend at...

194
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,985
Oh, wait, I can't tell you
where I got it, because then...

195
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,071
No, don't say...

196
00:11:54,161 --> 00:11:56,974
- I have to kill you...
- Because then you have to kill me.

197
00:11:57,094 --> 00:12:00,620
All I need to know is whether this
will effectively identify victor.

198
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,001
Jaime needs to lock on to peoples'eyes.

199
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:05,890
Once she does, the program
converts the details

200
00:12:06,024 --> 00:12:09,091
of the iris stromal pattern into a
bit pattern, and I can cross-reference.

201
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,818
Once I affirm the match,

202
00:12:10,892 --> 00:12:12,245
I apprise agent summers

203
00:12:12,351 --> 00:12:15,844
so that she can determine the means
to extricate the mark to the jimjam.

204
00:12:15,978 --> 00:12:18,866
You realize that spies
don't really talk that way.

205
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,010
I know. It blows.

206
00:12:21,085 --> 00:12:23,295
I'm just trying to bring back the cool.

207
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:26,470
Anyway, if jaime meets
victor's eyes, we'll find him.

208
00:12:26,556 --> 00:12:29,165
Victor's altered his
appearance numerous times.

209
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:32,610
Even if victor has gone
victoria, the program is airtight.

210
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,020
Okay, this biometric technology
makes photoshop look like pong.

211
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:38,602
Unprecedented false
rate match. Like, never.

212
00:12:38,743 --> 00:12:41,066
Even these geniuses
can't change their eyes.

213
00:12:41,185 --> 00:12:43,150
Wouldn't be so sure about that.

214
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:44,371
Alexis.

215
00:12:45,026 --> 00:12:46,083
Ruth.

216
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:48,085
Nice work in Dubai.

217
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,630
Where'd you find your floater?

218
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,430
High school sweetheart.

219
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,485
Jaime summers, that's a new
name. How long has she been...

220
00:12:57,897 --> 00:13:01,604
What is she,12? How did you find her?

221
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,837
Happy accident.

222
00:13:05,311 --> 00:13:07,120
Iris recognition.

223
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:10,820
I doubt your operative can get 200
captures during the cocktail party.

224
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:13,902
I don't know, our girl is pretty good.

225
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,440
Dude, don't... Don't touch my stuff.

226
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:34,885
There's a lot of
security, but we knew that.

227
00:13:34,991 --> 00:13:38,570
Yeah, packing semiautomatics outside
the embassy is a pretty big deal.

228
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:41,901
If they're doing that.

229
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,420
Are they?

230
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,780
They are.

231
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,192
So what's the embassy party for, anyway?

232
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,785
Environmentalists.

233
00:13:49,904 --> 00:13:52,629
I didn't know environmentalists
liked to party.

234
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:57,356
Hey, if we I.D. Victor
before 8:00, croissants on me.

235
00:13:57,758 --> 00:13:59,872
It's gonna be more
complicated than that.

236
00:13:59,991 --> 00:14:02,998
I know. Just trying to lighten the mood.

237
00:14:03,162 --> 00:14:04,219
Jeez.

238
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,715
Jaime...

239
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,135
I have to go out in the
field with a clear head.

240
00:14:14,224 --> 00:14:16,805
If I lose focus for a second, I'm dead.

241
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:20,447
Now, I can handle that
responsibility if it's just about me.

242
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:24,564
But I can't even begin to think about
screwing up and, as a result, you...

243
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:29,760
Personal relationships
can compromise a mission...

244
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,880
I get it. I do.

245
00:14:30,968 --> 00:14:32,239
I like you. I really do.

246
00:14:32,328 --> 00:14:34,000
Look, I think we should just be friends.

247
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,281
Good. Good.

248
00:14:35,415 --> 00:14:38,025
- We haven't even had a second date.
- Exactly.

249
00:14:38,134 --> 00:14:39,832
It's gonna be fine.

250
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:42,500
Just partners executing a job.

251
00:14:42,705 --> 00:14:43,971
That's right.

252
00:14:50,469 --> 00:14:53,210
I thought you guys said
that brennan was gonna call.

253
00:14:53,298 --> 00:14:55,690
'cause he didn't.
That's a bad sign, right?

254
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,925
Calm down. He's coming over.

255
00:14:58,033 --> 00:15:01,780
You guys'll hang out, we'll watch
reservoir dogs, and you two'll hook up.

256
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:02,675
The end.

257
00:15:02,842 --> 00:15:06,371
No, no, I don't really wanna
hook up during reservoir dogs.

258
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,763
Okay, I guess I can make that work.

259
00:15:16,264 --> 00:15:19,465
Hey, becca. This is my friend annie.

260
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,207
Hi, rebecca.

261
00:15:21,341 --> 00:15:23,143
It's becca.

262
00:15:24,572 --> 00:15:26,810
Annie didn't even know
who quentin tarantino was.

263
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:28,230
Oh, shut up.

264
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,820
Sorry, excuse me.

265
00:15:38,366 --> 00:15:40,317
Hopefully the receiving
line's still happening.

266
00:15:40,421 --> 00:15:42,997
That way we can split
up and cover more ground.

267
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,880
Victor could look like
anyone, so we have...

268
00:15:55,513 --> 00:15:57,440
Could you zip me up?

269
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:20,958
The drop needs to happen by 9:45.

270
00:16:21,074 --> 00:16:23,316
We've got to id victor before then.

271
00:16:23,432 --> 00:16:25,755
Security at 3:00 and 9:00.

272
00:16:27,408 --> 00:16:29,625
Surveillance cameras
in the grandfather clock

273
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:31,337
and ugly flower arrangements.

274
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,050
- Okay, how are you getting that?
- Oh, come on.

275
00:16:36,178 --> 00:16:39,218
What did those guys teach you
at langley, anyway?

276
00:16:40,675 --> 00:16:42,978
Possible target id, northwest corner.

277
00:16:43,106 --> 00:16:45,129
Funny, I would have said by the buffet.

278
00:16:45,256 --> 00:16:46,215
Shut up.

279
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:50,083
<i>Perhaps we can debate lithuanian
tariffs another time.</i>

280
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:52,692
<i>Mrs. Varnas is in basle tonight.</i>

281
00:16:53,235 --> 00:16:54,299
Not our guy.

282
00:16:54,426 --> 00:16:57,281
He's about to leave with her
and it's not even 9:00 yet.

283
00:16:57,397 --> 00:16:58,229
Okay.

284
00:16:59,536 --> 00:17:00,486
God.

285
00:17:00,749 --> 00:17:02,913
What do these euro douches have over me?

286
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:04,763
Wealth, power, dignity.

287
00:17:09,017 --> 00:17:09,955
No match.

288
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:14,279
Plenty of targets, let's look around.
Him? No

289
00:17:14,906 --> 00:17:18,027
No way, what's this guy, shaolin
monks here. This is a great party.

290
00:17:18,154 --> 00:17:19,437
Why am I not there?

291
00:17:25,064 --> 00:17:26,131
By the bar.

292
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:28,432
Nope.

293
00:17:29,195 --> 00:17:30,762
No, look at his hands.

294
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,900
They're in the broken zipper position.

295
00:17:33,028 --> 00:17:36,517
Low and in front of the waist.
The sign of defensiveness.

296
00:17:37,037 --> 00:17:40,491
Everything we have on our guy
says he's a sociopath. Cool

297
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:42,121
And confident.

298
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:43,866
Okay.

299
00:17:47,174 --> 00:17:49,474
Fernando! Is that you?

300
00:17:49,994 --> 00:17:52,032
May I help you, senorita?

301
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:56,616
That's so good. He looks like a
fernando. Not him, let's go. No match.

302
00:17:57,512 --> 00:18:00,233
Sorry, I mistook you for somebody else.

303
00:18:00,464 --> 00:18:01,897
And it's senora.

304
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,253
Now... He could be our man.

305
00:18:18,923 --> 00:18:22,300
He's not a diplomat, his shoes aren't
shined, he's not wearing a cummerbund,

306
00:18:22,418 --> 00:18:24,753
and his jacket's one size too big.

307
00:18:26,129 --> 00:18:28,622
Tom, you're an ana...
You psychoanalyze people.

308
00:18:28,749 --> 00:18:31,188
Neurosurgeon, and you're a therapist.

309
00:18:33,209 --> 00:18:35,093
We're running out of time.

310
00:18:39,371 --> 00:18:43,164
Drinking, why not? Let's drink now.
This is what we do at work.

311
00:18:43,546 --> 00:18:45,458
Do you know you're at work?

312
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,124
What about him?

313
00:18:50,644 --> 00:18:54,487
Yeah, how about, yeah, colonel
sanders over here? He looks good.

314
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:06,350
That's a rare vintage in this town.

315
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:10,106
Only thing I order when I'm in paris.
Drives the french nuts.

316
00:19:10,245 --> 00:19:11,956
So I take it you're not from paris.

317
00:19:12,072 --> 00:19:14,881
No, I just couriered a package
over here this morning.

318
00:19:14,997 --> 00:19:17,494
Got roped into this little get-together.

319
00:19:17,612 --> 00:19:18,687
It's a rental.

320
00:19:18,802 --> 00:19:20,643
Catch his eye.

321
00:19:20,863 --> 00:19:22,042
C'est la vie.

322
00:19:22,137 --> 00:19:24,264
Come on, look her in the eye, come on.

323
00:19:24,366 --> 00:19:26,528
I'm based in D.C. And, you?

324
00:19:26,655 --> 00:19:29,337
I'm a professor at stanford, and my
husband is an art historian

325
00:19:29,454 --> 00:19:31,939
doing research at the picasso museum.

326
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:35,500
No, I'm here for
the van gogh retrospectives, actually.

327
00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:38,000
She's a beautiful lady. Come on!

328
00:19:38,236 --> 00:19:40,918
What are you doing? He's looking
at everything but your eyes.

329
00:19:41,045 --> 00:19:45,033
Come on, casino royale. I'm shaken
and I'm stirred, okay? Come on.

330
00:19:45,544 --> 00:19:47,741
What's your favorite picasso?

331
00:19:48,215 --> 00:19:51,927
My favorite? Well, no, I'm
focused mainly on the impressionists.

332
00:19:52,042 --> 00:19:56,015
But as an art historian, you must have
at least a passing interest in picasso.

333
00:19:57,516 --> 00:19:59,793
- I like the blue period.
- Yeah, blue period rocks.

334
00:19:59,913 --> 00:20:03,370
Favorite, dora maar au chat.
You know it?

335
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:05,716
No, I don't.

336
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:08,897
You'd know it if you saw it.

337
00:20:09,024 --> 00:20:11,659
Look, when I was dropping off
this package this morning,

338
00:20:11,786 --> 00:20:15,298
There was this piece in the secretary's
office. A picasso.

339
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:18,188
But I can't tell if it's an original.
Maybe you could,

340
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,922
take a look at it for me?

341
00:20:20,045 --> 00:20:22,057
Well, maybe later. We just got here.

342
00:20:22,173 --> 00:20:24,479
Honey, let's see it.
Maybe it's one you don't know.

343
00:20:24,604 --> 00:20:27,303
Attagirl. That's what i'm talking about.

344
00:20:27,534 --> 00:20:29,916
It's close, just one flight down.

345
00:20:30,546 --> 00:20:31,898
Right up your alley.

346
00:20:32,025 --> 00:20:33,458
Thank you. Thanks.

347
00:20:33,574 --> 00:20:34,672
I've got a hunch.

348
00:20:34,794 --> 00:20:37,539
- What are you doing?
- Just go with it.

349
00:20:40,926 --> 00:20:42,660
All right, there we go.

350
00:20:43,344 --> 00:20:46,303
Come on, we gotta get
a clear shot of his eyes. Let's do this.

351
00:20:57,418 --> 00:20:58,932
Right through here.

352
00:21:03,404 --> 00:21:05,150
First door on the left.

353
00:21:08,793 --> 00:21:10,516
Yes, finally.

354
00:21:11,922 --> 00:21:14,604
We have a match.
That's him. That's victor.

355
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,937
See ya.

356
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:27,804
Come on!

357
00:21:36,152 --> 00:21:37,493
I know it's him.

358
00:21:37,955 --> 00:21:39,019
We lost him.

359
00:21:39,135 --> 00:21:39,995
How?

360
00:21:41,825 --> 00:21:43,616
He locked us in a wine vault.

361
00:21:43,741 --> 00:21:46,330
Getting locked in
a wine vault is a cliche.

362
00:21:46,457 --> 00:21:48,746
And do I need to remind
you that you're bionic?

363
00:21:48,867 --> 00:21:51,740
Yeah, I know, I'm on it.
I'll call you back.

364
00:21:51,878 --> 00:21:52,929
Let me help.

365
00:21:53,031 --> 00:21:55,489
- You've been such a great help so far.
- Pardon me?

366
00:21:55,608 --> 00:21:57,966
Let's go see that picasso.
Maybe it's one you don't know.

367
00:21:58,082 --> 00:22:01,487
Everyone knows that's picasso's
most famous painting. Everyone.

368
00:22:01,606 --> 00:22:04,509
You're the one who went down
picasso road. I was briefed in van gogh.

369
00:22:04,602 --> 00:22:07,130
Then you're like, let's just do
down into this dark basement

370
00:22:07,204 --> 00:22:09,318
- with a strange man.
- Anybody can be surprised.

371
00:22:09,378 --> 00:22:11,714
- It's embarrassing is what it is.
- Ass!

372
00:22:14,118 --> 00:22:17,852
You know, the buy is happening now.
Can we just try this together?

373
00:22:18,442 --> 00:22:21,018
What do you weigh, a buck ten?
That'll make a huge difference.

374
00:22:21,145 --> 00:22:22,683
We'll see. Whatever.

375
00:22:25,358 --> 00:22:27,000
Thanks. But I loosened it.

376
00:22:27,127 --> 00:22:28,515
Whatever. Come on.

377
00:22:54,162 --> 00:22:55,318
Did you see that?

378
00:22:55,434 --> 00:22:56,393
See what?

379
00:22:56,983 --> 00:22:58,197
Work with me.

380
00:23:09,702 --> 00:23:10,554
Excuse me.

381
00:23:10,658 --> 00:23:12,667
The only place we could find
a little privacy.

382
00:23:12,787 --> 00:23:15,642
I need you now
to turn around and go up the stairs?

383
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:19,532
How much am I gonna have to pay
you to look the other way?

384
00:23:27,854 --> 00:23:30,467
- You know, I was gonna do that.
- Sorry.

385
00:23:30,629 --> 00:23:32,153
That's all right. Nice technique.

386
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,239
Thank you.

387
00:23:48,423 --> 00:23:49,406
Let's go.

388
00:24:11,737 --> 00:24:13,129
- I'm just gonna go
- What?

389
00:24:13,222 --> 00:24:14,644
- Gonna go.
- Becca...

390
00:24:14,771 --> 00:24:16,834
Look, I'm fine, okay? It's fine.

391
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:30,643
Jerk!

392
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,218
License and registration.

393
00:25:18,229 --> 00:25:19,570
<i>You're late.</i>

394
00:25:30,618 --> 00:25:32,732
- All right, I'm going in alone.
- You're kidding?

395
00:25:32,821 --> 00:25:35,493
I know you can handle yourself, but
this guy's gonna be armed.

396
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:36,668
You're not ready for this.

397
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:39,700
Victor's in that room. That's the
mission. We both have to go in there.

398
00:25:39,775 --> 00:25:40,832
It's too dangerous.

399
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:43,168
We both knew it was dangerous
before we came to Paris.

400
00:25:43,303 --> 00:25:45,023
- Nothing's changed.
- Yes, it has!

401
00:25:45,657 --> 00:25:47,373
So I'm your trophy spy.

402
00:25:47,532 --> 00:25:49,914
Come on! This is harder than I thought.
Just hang back.

403
00:25:50,013 --> 00:25:52,675
You don't get to corner the market
on brave. We both have to go.

404
00:25:52,795 --> 00:25:55,319
You think you're being a gentleman,
but it's condescending.

405
00:25:55,424 --> 00:25:56,526
Get over yourself.

406
00:25:59,156 --> 00:26:00,158
I'll take him.

407
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:57,997
- You okay?
- Yeah.

408
00:27:09,851 --> 00:27:10,893
sClear.

409
00:27:11,699 --> 00:27:13,200
There's nothing on him. No list.

410
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,775
It's not Victor. It looks like him,
but it's not him.

411
00:27:15,895 --> 00:27:16,972
Go, now.

412
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,388
Wait, we have to go back for Tom!

413
00:27:19,525 --> 00:27:20,565
There's no time.

414
00:27:29,337 --> 00:27:30,337
Where is Victor?

415
00:27:30,457 --> 00:27:33,094
We had a lock. It's not my fault
she takes out a whole new guy.

416
00:27:33,205 --> 00:27:34,357
Why hasn't Tom called?

417
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:37,529
Trying to locate his tracking device.
It says he's still at the embassy,

418
00:27:37,649 --> 00:27:39,765
the GPS could have been
knocked loose, left behind.

419
00:27:39,885 --> 00:27:42,128
He's still there. We have to go back
and just go in.

420
00:27:42,263 --> 00:27:45,060
Hello? It's sovereign territory.
Just going in is not an option.

421
00:27:45,726 --> 00:27:46,922
Where did she come from?

422
00:27:52,021 --> 00:27:53,815
You cost me quite
a lot of money tonight.

423
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,623
Who do you work for?

424
00:27:58,945 --> 00:28:00,411
The Metropolitan Museum of Art.

425
00:28:00,581 --> 00:28:01,655
Really?

426
00:28:06,533 --> 00:28:08,492
The only reason
you're not dead yet is...

427
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,582
I forgot.

428
00:28:28,294 --> 00:28:29,644
Can I talk to Tom?

429
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:33,872
Tom, it's for you.

430
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,079
I can't believe you called me.

431
00:28:38,477 --> 00:28:40,966
Shut up. Are you okay?

432
00:28:41,313 --> 00:28:42,540
Honey, everything's fine.

433
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,815
You know how much I love
to hang out with the guys.

434
00:28:44,944 --> 00:28:46,867
Don't worry, I'm gonna be fine.

435
00:28:47,828 --> 00:28:48,831
Let me guess,

436
00:28:49,856 --> 00:28:51,135
you want your husband back.

437
00:28:51,255 --> 00:28:52,905
This is the wife, right?

438
00:28:54,895 --> 00:28:56,169
Good for you.

439
00:28:56,855 --> 00:28:57,880
You want him back.

440
00:28:58,358 --> 00:29:01,117
<i>I'm afraid it's gonna cost you
quite a lot.</i>

441
00:29:01,355 --> 00:29:02,552
I do want him back.

442
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,362
And I also want the list.

443
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,217
The list, really?

444
00:29:09,705 --> 00:29:10,826
Really.

445
00:29:12,313 --> 00:29:13,410
$6 million.

446
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,340
Fine.

447
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,133
2 million for your husband.

448
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:20,975
Great.

449
00:29:21,406 --> 00:29:22,487
One hour.

450
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,165
Go to the cafe Sartre

451
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:25,684
<i>at the Clignancourt.</i>

452
00:29:25,804 --> 00:29:26,820
<i>3% in cash,</i>

453
00:29:26,996 --> 00:29:28,530
the rest in bearer bonds.

454
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:31,704
If I see you with anyone else, I'll cut
your fake husband into real pieces.

455
00:29:35,586 --> 00:29:37,136
Does Tom have Victor?

456
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,830
Reverse that.

457
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,831
We can get Tom and the list
for 8 million.

458
00:29:41,165 --> 00:29:42,626
The drop's in 58 minutes.

459
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:45,455
What makes you think I can get
$8 million in less than an hour?

460
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:46,975
You can't?

461
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,361
I'm not authorized to release
that amount.

462
00:29:51,675 --> 00:29:53,526
Can you call someone who is?

463
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,350
- Is that a yes?
- Give me a minute.

464
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:59,737
Whatever. We still have 57 of 'em.

465
00:30:03,173 --> 00:30:04,723
Can you get the money?

466
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:06,822
I know someone who can.

467
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,816
Can you get me $8 million in,
say, 45 minutes?

468
00:30:18,562 --> 00:30:19,655
Thank you.

469
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,714
It's for the mission, right?

470
00:30:22,834 --> 00:30:25,034
<i>No, I found this great pair of shoes.</i>

471
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,995
You know, being flip
doesn't engender my trust.

472
00:30:28,335 --> 00:30:29,569
It's to buy the list.

473
00:30:30,657 --> 00:30:32,697
I'll authorize the wire.
Nathan knows the account.

474
00:30:32,829 --> 00:30:33,865
Thank you.

475
00:30:34,147 --> 00:30:35,169
<i>Just get it done.</i>

476
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,109
Wait, you're Jaime's boss?

477
00:30:47,974 --> 00:30:51,081
Sorry, she said I should call you
if there was an emergency.

478
00:30:51,261 --> 00:30:54,792
Driving without a license underage and
intoxicated, I'd say that qualifies.

479
00:30:55,139 --> 00:30:58,180
Well, thanks for your help, but I'm
just gonna go call one of my friends...

480
00:30:58,806 --> 00:31:00,402
I'm responsible for getting you home.

481
00:31:00,522 --> 00:31:02,683
On the way, we can have a little chat.

482
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,750
- We can't go in after Tom.
- What?

483
00:31:10,978 --> 00:31:13,545
We're not authorized to do anymore here.
My hands are tied.

484
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:16,035
Your agent's life's on the line,
and that's your response?

485
00:31:16,225 --> 00:31:18,710
This is a ghost mission now.
Tom is solely accountable.

486
00:31:18,894 --> 00:31:20,270
He knows that's how it works.

487
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:22,855
He wouldn't want us to put
other agents lives in jeopardy.

488
00:31:23,155 --> 00:31:24,926
He's compromised, Jaime.

489
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,741
What would you say if I told you
I'm gonna go in and get him?

490
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,659
I'd say good for you.

491
00:31:38,971 --> 00:31:40,650
Who's gonna have my back in there?

492
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:43,050
We're gonna be with you
every step of the way, okay?

493
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,778
Are we good?

494
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,637
Absolutely.

495
00:31:57,512 --> 00:31:59,191
You have a mic and earwig.

496
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,580
We can talk to you, you can talk to us.

497
00:32:01,987 --> 00:32:03,550
I don't like you in the market alone.

498
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,739
I won't be alone.
You and Jae'll be covering me.

499
00:32:05,821 --> 00:32:07,990
You just can't be with me.
It's too dangerous to Tom.

500
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:11,808
Jaime, Berkut is allowing you
to carry $8 million to get the list.

501
00:32:12,145 --> 00:32:13,879
Not to hang out with your boyfriend.

502
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:17,050
I have a degree in psychology.
Quit playing with that ring.

503
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:19,041
There isn't time to reinvent the plan.

504
00:32:19,357 --> 00:32:21,287
The list is the only reason we're here.

505
00:32:21,838 --> 00:32:24,988
She can do it. $240,000 in cash.

506
00:32:25,108 --> 00:32:26,854
The rest in bearer bonds. You good?

507
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,121
Drop me here.

508
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:41,442
So I'm supposed to believe
my sister's selling time-shares?

509
00:32:46,821 --> 00:32:48,885
What are the most popular time-shares?

510
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:50,478
I'd have to say Arizona.

511
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,436
No, it's too hot.

512
00:32:53,631 --> 00:32:54,941
Old people like that.

513
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:59,314
I mean, what is my sister doing
selling them?

514
00:32:59,669 --> 00:33:00,955
If I had to guess, I'd say

515
00:33:01,075 --> 00:33:04,060
she's trying to earn a decent living
so she can take care of you.

516
00:33:04,153 --> 00:33:05,153
Great.

517
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,862
I realize why she wanted me to call you.

518
00:33:07,997 --> 00:33:09,733
It's, like, a guilt trip once removed.

519
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,751
Sorry, I didn't mean to lay
a guilt trip on ya.

520
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,668
I have a daughter,
she's accused me of that.

521
00:33:18,842 --> 00:33:20,482
She's probably right, so I apologize.

522
00:33:21,055 --> 00:33:22,184
It's okay.

523
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,086
I'm not into Jaime's list of secrets,
you know?

524
00:33:29,659 --> 00:33:32,866
It's like some things she just...
puts on this repeat loop.

525
00:33:32,986 --> 00:33:35,378
And then others
she totally clams up about.

526
00:33:35,802 --> 00:33:37,133
I mean, we're sisters.

527
00:33:37,908 --> 00:33:39,895
Like... Okay, her fiancé?

528
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,689
She never talks about him.

529
00:33:42,174 --> 00:33:43,254
And he died.

530
00:33:43,986 --> 00:33:45,414
I mean, that's weird, right?

531
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,424
We're family, we should be able
to talk about that stuff.

532
00:33:49,577 --> 00:33:50,581
Yeah, you should.

533
00:33:52,181 --> 00:33:53,190
Are you gonna say

534
00:33:53,315 --> 00:33:54,911
"Maybe she has her reasons"?

535
00:33:55,031 --> 00:33:56,782
Maybe she does, you know?

536
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,002
<i>Just keep walking
to the center of the cafe.</i>

537
00:34:05,122 --> 00:34:06,402
Fine, but I want you to...

538
00:34:08,734 --> 00:34:09,828
Damn it.

539
00:34:18,249 --> 00:34:19,310
Hey, pretty lady.

540
00:34:20,586 --> 00:34:21,602
Care to join me?

541
00:34:25,782 --> 00:34:27,132
Here we are, second date.

542
00:34:28,005 --> 00:34:29,134
Not a cheap one.

543
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:30,469
How much?

544
00:34:31,006 --> 00:34:32,881
- $8 million.
- God.

545
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,890
I don't mind saying
I expect you to put out.

546
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:39,527
That's very forward of you.
You must be american.

547
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,990
That looks nice on you.

548
00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:47,351
Don't worry about it.
It's a cubic zirconia.

549
00:34:47,471 --> 00:34:48,474
No, it's not.

550
00:34:48,651 --> 00:34:49,686
Okay, it's not.

551
00:34:50,433 --> 00:34:52,635
- I do have an expense account.
- So it's a write-off.

552
00:34:52,817 --> 00:34:54,862
Now you're making me sound
like I'm not romantic.

553
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,933
I shouldn't have said
any of that stuff on the roof.

554
00:35:01,053 --> 00:35:03,373
- No, Tom, I was way out of line.
- It was complete crap.

555
00:35:03,493 --> 00:35:05,239
I didn't mean
what I said at the embassy.

556
00:35:05,348 --> 00:35:07,288
- About me being condescending?
- Any of it.

557
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:09,685
I shouldn't have said that stuff.
You can kick some ass.

558
00:35:09,805 --> 00:35:11,086
- I can.
- You can.

559
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,829
God, you're beautiful.

560
00:35:17,598 --> 00:35:20,311
You realize that the minute
that you put the money on the table,

561
00:35:20,431 --> 00:35:21,800
- we're dead, right?
- Right.

562
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,062
And if you didn't bring any money,
we're also dead?

563
00:35:25,475 --> 00:35:27,401
You read comic books as a kid?

564
00:35:27,521 --> 00:35:28,679
I did. I loved 'em.

565
00:35:29,081 --> 00:35:31,088
<i>My favorite was this one
called Freedom Fighters.</i>

566
00:35:31,352 --> 00:35:33,571
<i>There was this great character
called The Human Bomb.</i>

567
00:35:35,486 --> 00:35:36,489
My God.

568
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:41,266
Bombs, no.

569
00:35:41,846 --> 00:35:43,274
Nobody said bombs.

570
00:35:46,203 --> 00:35:47,584
Great. You want an espresso?

571
00:35:49,302 --> 00:35:51,289
Good evening,
I've got a list of specials.

572
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:04,418
Bingo, we got it. Pay dirt.

573
00:36:04,638 --> 00:36:06,510
Actually, I'm not that hungry.

574
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,036
Cafe policy,

575
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,273
<i>mademoiselle.</i>

576
00:36:09,494 --> 00:36:11,442
You cannot sit at the table
without paying.

577
00:36:13,807 --> 00:36:14,887
I can pay.

578
00:36:15,286 --> 00:36:16,341
Good.

579
00:36:26,207 --> 00:36:27,358
Get away from me!

580
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,520
- How do I deactivate it?
- You can't.

581
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,418
Now let me check the manual. Can I look?
Give me two seconds.

582
00:36:32,885 --> 00:36:34,520
No. It's a solar fuse detonator.

583
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,881
One of the leads is hot and the other
two are decoys! Pull the wrong lead...

584
00:36:39,009 --> 00:36:40,244
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

585
00:36:44,331 --> 00:36:45,392
It's the...

586
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:47,603
Black wire. I'm sure. Yank that puppy.

587
00:36:47,723 --> 00:36:49,537
Wait! Wait!

588
00:36:49,745 --> 00:36:50,745
Yank it!

589
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,490
Lucky guess.

590
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,096
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

591
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,396
Holy...

592
00:37:02,267 --> 00:37:03,694
All right. Stay out of the open.

593
00:37:05,621 --> 00:37:07,171
Watch out! Watch out!

594
00:37:08,807 --> 00:37:09,811
Watch out!

595
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,553
Where the hell did you come from?

596
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,401
How the hell'd you get here?

597
00:38:07,521 --> 00:38:08,833
I'm a really fast runner.

598
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:15,301
So they recovered about $4 million.

599
00:38:15,421 --> 00:38:17,695
The rest is working it's way
into the french economy.

600
00:38:17,793 --> 00:38:19,527
Well,
I was actually carrying $8 million.

601
00:38:19,612 --> 00:38:21,540
So in a way,
I got the list for half price.

602
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,211
Listen. Don't just call me
for money. Call for backup.

603
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:26,155
This time we came out ahead.

604
00:38:26,275 --> 00:38:28,359
- Could've done better.
- I was thinking about Tom.

605
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:30,356
I was thinking about you.

606
00:38:32,629 --> 00:38:34,728
- What about the CIA?
- What about 'em?

607
00:38:34,848 --> 00:38:36,480
- You give 'em Victor?
- Yeah.

608
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,374
But they left Tom. They abandoned him.

609
00:38:38,494 --> 00:38:41,180
Frankly, Victor's a lot
better off with the CIA.

610
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:48,644
By the way, my sister didn't call,
did she?

611
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:49,971
I gave her your number.

612
00:38:54,997 --> 00:38:57,408
How did you get to Victor
before I did? And...

613
00:38:57,972 --> 00:38:59,893
How did you figure out
the explosive device?

614
00:39:00,013 --> 00:39:01,580
Don't tell me you guessed, please.

615
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,437
- I didn't guess, I...
- What?

616
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,870
I don't know how to tell you
how I did it.

617
00:39:07,155 --> 00:39:10,405
The time you were working on the wiring,
I should've been scared for my life.

618
00:39:10,525 --> 00:39:13,171
But actually I was just thinking
about how nice your hair smells.

619
00:39:14,002 --> 00:39:15,690
- Okay. You know what?
- What?

620
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,938
I will not wait eight days
again for you to call me.

621
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:22,119
You've got one more shot at this thing.
Two strikes and you're out.

622
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:23,300
Rule 27.

623
00:39:24,792 --> 00:39:26,343
Hey, how about dinner?

624
00:39:26,646 --> 00:39:28,942
I mean, we're in Paris and all.

625
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:32,071
I'd love to, but I have
to get back to my sister.

626
00:39:32,191 --> 00:39:36,169
No dinner the same day
you save a guy's life. Is that rule #26?

627
00:39:37,014 --> 00:39:40,295
That's not a rule.
That's just me needing to see my sister.

628
00:39:49,112 --> 00:39:50,173
I'll call you.

629
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:57,017
Hello!

630
00:39:57,383 --> 00:39:58,483
You here?

631
00:40:00,938 --> 00:40:02,945
I thought you weren't coming back
till 7:00.

632
00:40:03,514 --> 00:40:06,065
What are you doing
that you shouldn't be?

633
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,489
If you tell me first before I find out,
I might not freak.

634
00:40:09,609 --> 00:40:11,259
I'm not doing anything.

635
00:40:11,547 --> 00:40:12,570
Come here.

636
00:40:13,297 --> 00:40:15,969
Sure this isn't a diversion to get
your guy Brennan out a window?

637
00:40:16,089 --> 00:40:17,298
Please.

638
00:40:17,445 --> 00:40:19,644
Brennan is yesterday's drama.

639
00:40:25,707 --> 00:40:26,723
It's warm.

640
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,590
I put it in the dryer.

641
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:34,458
I'm so sorry I assumed
you did something bad.

642
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,750
You know, I worry
about you so much when I'm away.

643
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:41,219
And I worry about whether
I'm doing the right thing.

644
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:43,673
And I'm just so tired.

645
00:40:48,694 --> 00:40:50,334
I know what you're giving up for me.

646
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:52,646
For us.

647
00:40:54,808 --> 00:40:57,277
I am exactly where I want to be
right now, okay?

648
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:02,465
Go take a bath.

649
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,023
I think I will.

650
00:41:05,389 --> 00:41:06,431
Thank you.
