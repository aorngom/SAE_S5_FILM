1
00:00:00,584 --> 00:00:02,168
<i>Previously on Melrose Place</i>

2
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:04,712
You are a hugely talented filmmaker.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,150
I'm not saying that because
I'm your publicist, manager and agent.

4
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:09,708
Ella has a thing for you.

5
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:12,444
You think she's pushing your career
out of the goodness of her heart?

6
00:00:12,569 --> 00:00:13,938
Rotations start next week,

7
00:00:14,063 --> 00:00:16,823
and I'm still a little
concerned about your finances.

8
00:00:16,948 --> 00:00:19,143
- You sure you can work that out?
- I can work it out.

9
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,729
I didn't peg you as someone
who wanted to pursue this

10
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:24,959
- line of work on a regular basis.
- Will you give me a chance?

11
00:00:25,084 --> 00:00:26,609
What's a rich boy like you

12
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,110
doing this stuff for anyway?

13
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,488
I need cash, okay?
Bring me something I can move.

14
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,948
If you were happy,
you wouldn't have called me.

15
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,450
You definitely wouldn't have
been sleeping with me.

16
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:35,855
It was a mistake.

17
00:00:36,306 --> 00:00:39,163
- You're my mom.
- Listen to me. I never had a baby.

18
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:40,581
Don't do this to me.

19
00:00:42,599 --> 00:00:43,747
Oh, my God. Sydney.

20
00:01:35,498 --> 00:01:37,054
You scared me.

21
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,306
The door was open. What are you
doing in Auggie's apartment?

22
00:01:39,737 --> 00:01:42,935
Auggie's surfing in Cabo.
I'm just picking him mail up

23
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,193
for him, watering the herb garden...

24
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,772
In his bedroom?

25
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,276
I was just looking for the plant food
he told me about.

26
00:01:52,107 --> 00:01:53,446
It's in the kitchen.

27
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,051
I usually take care of Auggie's
place when he's out of town.

28
00:01:56,176 --> 00:01:57,783
I guess this time he asked me.

29
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,078
If you don't believe me,

30
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,830
you can call him and ask him.

31
00:02:10,803 --> 00:02:12,131
"Dear Auggie.

32
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,832
"You won't talk to me,

33
00:02:13,957 --> 00:02:15,949
"won't let me explain
why I fell apart.

34
00:02:16,823 --> 00:02:18,085
"It's my ex-husband.

35
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,732
"I thought this time he'd choose me,

36
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:23,740
"but one woman's
never enough for him.

37
00:02:23,865 --> 00:02:27,372
"Even after 16 years, Michael
brings out my worst demons.

38
00:02:29,174 --> 00:02:31,263
"All I can do is numb myself.

39
00:02:31,848 --> 00:02:33,110
Love, Sydney."

40
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,495
Oh, my God!
My daughter can't breathe!

41
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,205
She's in respiratory distress!

42
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:45,790
We need to do something now.
Have you got an ABG?

43
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,833
- Where's the on call?
- On her way.

44
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,251
O2 sat levels are falling.

45
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:51,837
Left-to-right shunting,

46
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,525
decrease in the
ventilation-perfusion ratio.

47
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,341
- Get the CPAP, go!
- What's the status?

48
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,434
Hypoxemia.
Possible pulmonary edema.

49
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,640
It's okay, sweetheart.
You're going to be okay.

50
00:03:09,535 --> 00:03:10,476
Nice work.

51
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:12,989
- Long hours must be paying off.
- Thanks, Doctor.

52
00:03:13,114 --> 00:03:14,574
There's nowhere I'd rather be.

53
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:15,576
How's David?

54
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:17,897
I haven't heard from him lately.
He must be as busy as you.

55
00:03:18,022 --> 00:03:19,213
He seems fine.

56
00:03:20,553 --> 00:03:22,693
I only see him in the
courtyard every now and then,

57
00:03:22,818 --> 00:03:24,603
but I'm happy to tell him
"hey" next time if you'd like.

58
00:03:24,728 --> 00:03:26,701
Okay. Keep up the good work.

59
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:33,722
You're going to be
going to a party tonight.

60
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:37,049
Intimate, elite and very discreet.

61
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,523
The client's going to love you.
He has very

62
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,567
- sophisticated taste.
- Sophisticated is good.

63
00:03:42,692 --> 00:03:45,573
<i>And you're going to be working</i>
with a group of my best girls.

64
00:03:45,698 --> 00:03:47,017
When you say "a group"

65
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,395
is that, like,
we're each going to be

66
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,846
assigned to a specific guy or...?

67
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,100
If you have a versatility issue,
I can call somebody else.

68
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:59,367
No versatility issues here.
Count me in.

69
00:04:10,802 --> 00:04:13,495
My new line, Real Denim by Anton V

70
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,630
uses certified organic
cotton, non-toxic dyes...

71
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:18,428
and equally important...

72
00:04:19,674 --> 00:04:21,760
the pockets are
specifically designed

73
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,598
to flatter the ass of every woman
from every angle.

74
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,391
That's good.
Keep going like that.

75
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,188
Aren't you late for your

76
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,066
power cocktails with the velvet
mafia pre-Laker game?

77
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,008
I got a half hour

78
00:04:38,671 --> 00:04:41,162
and a vested interest
in women's trendy denim.

79
00:04:41,287 --> 00:04:44,268
Or more like
a vested interest in what's under

80
00:04:44,393 --> 00:04:46,178
Anton's hemp boxer-briefs.

81
00:04:46,957 --> 00:04:48,743
Hot, talented, successful...

82
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,374
He's more than mere hookup material.

83
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,126
- I'd date him.
- That is so cute.

84
00:04:55,218 --> 00:04:56,760
How's the press kit
coming along?

85
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:59,215
Jonah, we need to see
the details, okay?!

86
00:05:00,805 --> 00:05:02,005
I can do that.

87
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,719
I'll take care of this.

88
00:05:03,844 --> 00:05:05,933
I mean, you don't want to be sober
for tipp-off.

89
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:07,518
Keep Anton happy.

90
00:05:09,795 --> 00:05:11,380
Find out if he's dating anybody.

91
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:13,499
I like it.

92
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,163
I get you gigs,
you exceed all expectations,

93
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:23,106
and we both come off
like superstars.

94
00:05:23,912 --> 00:05:25,244
Don't mess with the system.

95
00:05:25,853 --> 00:05:26,983
Look, I'm sorry.

96
00:05:27,489 --> 00:05:30,621
The focus was off when I zoomed
in on one of the buttonholes.

97
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,181
The focus or your focus?

98
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,352
I saw you yawning in between takes.

99
00:05:35,477 --> 00:05:37,628
Was there a Tarantino
marathon last night?

100
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:40,506
No, no. I was up late
redesigning my Web site.

101
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:42,709
I'm just trying to get
some cash flowing here.

102
00:05:43,194 --> 00:05:44,042
It's bad.

103
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:47,513
I don't have a thing
lined up after this gig.

104
00:05:48,206 --> 00:05:50,297
And you can't be my only
source of employment.

105
00:05:51,363 --> 00:05:52,610
Yeah, you're right.

106
00:05:53,348 --> 00:05:54,603
But today

107
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,814
is all about my
high-maintenance client,

108
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,881
and my boss' personal agenda.

109
00:05:59,006 --> 00:05:59,831
Okay?

110
00:06:00,091 --> 00:06:00,897
Great.

111
00:06:03,423 --> 00:06:06,365
I got the lens I need.
It's somewhere.

112
00:06:27,644 --> 00:06:29,653
You would not believe my day.

113
00:06:29,778 --> 00:06:31,611
A sharing issue at the crafts'

114
00:06:31,736 --> 00:06:34,298
table left me and my favorite
dress covered in paint.

115
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:37,479
Can you bring my diopter? I can't get
any extreme close-ups without it.

116
00:06:38,035 --> 00:06:39,659
Is it okay if I leave in 15?

117
00:06:39,784 --> 00:06:41,608
<i>I wouldn't ask you
if it wasn't urgent.</i>

118
00:06:42,278 --> 00:06:43,759
I'll be there as soon as I can.

119
00:06:50,545 --> 00:06:51,642
Beautiful.

120
00:06:52,763 --> 00:06:54,223
It's a Kazimuri.

121
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:55,914
From a collector in Santa Monica.

122
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,075
Got lost on its way to
the Guggenheim in Bilbao.

123
00:06:59,102 --> 00:07:01,628
You know anyone who
wants to give it a home?

124
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,315
I mean, you pick up a watch
or jewelry, I'm your guy.

125
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,119
But like that Vachon painting,

126
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,784
this is out of my league.

127
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:10,726
You got to go through my cousin,
with that stuff.

128
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,431
He's hooked into the art world?

129
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,100
Art, antiquities...

130
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,602
- When can I meet him?
- Tonight. I'll set it up.

131
00:07:17,044 --> 00:07:18,812
If I fence through your cousin,
what's in it for you?

132
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,954
He's family.

133
00:07:20,446 --> 00:07:22,496
Unlike whatever's going on
with you and your father,

134
00:07:22,621 --> 00:07:24,109
my people look out for each other.

135
00:07:26,662 --> 00:07:28,275
Good. If Hassan can look out for me,

136
00:07:28,944 --> 00:07:30,634
then consider me family, too.

137
00:07:40,702 --> 00:07:41,932
Excuse me?

138
00:07:42,908 --> 00:07:43,712
What?

139
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,159
- Who are you?
- I went to Emergency.

140
00:07:46,284 --> 00:07:49,726
They said it was going to take hours.
I saw your name by the elevator.

141
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,177
You're the head cardiologist, right?
I'm sorry, I'm just so scared...

142
00:07:53,302 --> 00:07:55,138
This is not the way things work

143
00:07:55,263 --> 00:07:56,952
- around here...
- Please, I feel like I'm dying.

144
00:07:57,077 --> 00:08:00,062
My heart, it feels like it's going
to jump right out of my chest.

145
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,652
<i>Dark_Chii, edouardn, Just-in, Kara,
Luoleilina, SirHill et WoLF971 présentent...</i>

146
00:08:08,817 --> 00:08:10,725
All right, Ms. Foster.

147
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,493
Please unbutton
so I can take a listen.

148
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:14,050
It's Violet.

149
00:08:29,326 --> 00:08:30,300
Is it bad?

150
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,768
Your heart rate is
definitely elevated,

151
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:35,725
but I don't hear
anything else unusual.

152
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,100
Do you have a family
history of heart disease?

153
00:08:38,425 --> 00:08:39,204
Maybe.

154
00:08:39,724 --> 00:08:40,776
I was adopted.

155
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,159
I don't think it's anything serious,

156
00:08:43,284 --> 00:08:45,190
but we should definitely
run some tests.

157
00:08:45,511 --> 00:08:46,290
Tests?

158
00:08:47,178 --> 00:08:50,033
You know what?
I'm feeling better already.

159
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,426
Do you drink a lot of caffeine?

160
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,855
'Cause sometimes that can cause
a racing heartbeat.

161
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,832
This morning, I had, like,
four energy drinks.

162
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,348
There you go.
That's probably all it is, because...

163
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:08,422
you look like a very
healthy young woman.

164
00:09:12,308 --> 00:09:13,802
Do you have medical insurance?

165
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,264
You know, I just started
a new job, so...

166
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,725
Why don't we consider
this visit off the books?

167
00:09:20,905 --> 00:09:22,586
That was so sweet of you.

168
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,651
Thank you so much.

169
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:26,589
You know,

170
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,567
you should come by Coal.

171
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:29,965
I'm a bartender.

172
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,059
I bet you pour a mean cocktail.

173
00:09:32,184 --> 00:09:33,479
I'll buy you a drink

174
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:35,073
to repay you.

175
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,892
- You don't have to do that.
- Please.

176
00:09:38,136 --> 00:09:39,286
I want to.

177
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,795
Heading out after a shift
on the Mancini team?

178
00:09:49,128 --> 00:09:51,274
I thought the old man
took pride in running

179
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,857
his protégés into the ground.

180
00:09:53,184 --> 00:09:54,747
He said to say "hey,"
by the way.

181
00:09:54,872 --> 00:09:56,704
Yeah? Well, you tell him I said
"hi" back.

182
00:09:58,691 --> 00:10:01,192
Dress plus makeup equals

183
00:10:01,317 --> 00:10:02,059
 date?

184
00:10:02,845 --> 00:10:03,892
Am I right?

185
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,085
Whatever.

186
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,992
Same guy from the Nightingale party?

187
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,467
No. Just...

188
00:10:10,572 --> 00:10:11,527
some other guy.

189
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:14,738
Can you help me with
this button, please?

190
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,721
There you go.

191
00:10:22,349 --> 00:10:23,559
Do I look all right?

192
00:10:24,453 --> 00:10:25,410
Not bad.

193
00:10:26,602 --> 00:10:28,251
You clean up good, Doc.

194
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:31,129
Have fun.

195
00:10:33,222 --> 00:10:34,124
You, too.

196
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,226
This is fabulous.

197
00:10:43,784 --> 00:10:45,014
Do you see that zipper?

198
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:46,864
Recycled copper.

199
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:48,792
Would you get a
close-up of that?

200
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:49,925
Okay, I just...

201
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,950
I want to stay wide
for one more sec.

202
00:10:53,729 --> 00:10:55,292
I don't have a sec, Jonah.

203
00:10:58,013 --> 00:11:00,659
Yes, everything is going well.

204
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,334
Anton could not be happier.

205
00:11:04,308 --> 00:11:06,084
Unclench and let me do my job.

206
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:10,859
Excuse me, this is a...
It's a private showroom.

207
00:11:11,716 --> 00:11:14,552
- I'm sorry to interrupt.
- She's cool. She's with me.

208
00:11:15,984 --> 00:11:17,126
Of course.

209
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,859
I did not know
which one the diopter was,

210
00:11:19,984 --> 00:11:21,326
so I just brought them all.

211
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:22,559
Thank you. Oh, my gosh.

212
00:11:22,684 --> 00:11:24,559
Fiancée of the year.

213
00:11:25,247 --> 00:11:27,326
You deserve the biggest
trophy in the world.

214
00:11:28,464 --> 00:11:31,392
I'll trade that trophy for a shoulder
massage when you get home.

215
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:34,026
When that bell rang, I literally
ran from the building.

216
00:11:34,184 --> 00:11:34,818
Why?

217
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:36,661
What happened?

218
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:38,925
For starters,

219
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,407
I'm a total failure
as a reptile wrangler.

220
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:44,513
- Hard Hat Bob went Shawshank?
- Who's Hard Hat Bob?

221
00:11:45,231 --> 00:11:46,092
A turtle.

222
00:11:46,611 --> 00:11:49,457
He broke out of
a maximum-security terrarium.

223
00:11:50,074 --> 00:11:53,258
Behind those beady little eyes
is the pea-sized brain of a mastermind.

224
00:11:53,817 --> 00:11:55,797
And now he's at large
in my classroom.

225
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:58,090
- You have a classroom?
- I teach first grade.

226
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,159
Of course.

227
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,052
You into fashion?

228
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,650
I couldn't even tell you what brand
of dress I'm wearing right now.

229
00:12:05,014 --> 00:12:08,018
As long as the pattern hides
paint and puke, works for me.

230
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:10,226
And story time's over.

231
00:12:11,057 --> 00:12:12,939
Time for the grown-ups
to get back to work now.

232
00:12:17,318 --> 00:12:20,154
Anton, do you like live music?

233
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:21,859
Because Caleb has tickets

234
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:24,746
- to the Greek Theater, and they are...
- It's genius.

235
00:12:26,189 --> 00:12:27,119
Really?

236
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,184
You don't even want
to know who the band is?

237
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:30,503
That girl right there.

238
00:12:31,507 --> 00:12:32,873
She's beautiful.

239
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:34,526
She's grounded.

240
00:12:36,118 --> 00:12:37,059
So real.

241
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:38,589
She's perfect.

242
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:39,792
For what,

243
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:41,550
monitoring a playground?

244
00:12:44,156 --> 00:12:45,413
She's perfect

245
00:12:46,017 --> 00:12:48,150
for the face of my new campaign.

246
00:12:52,002 --> 00:12:53,341
You're not kidding.

247
00:13:28,184 --> 00:13:29,558
God, I love yachts.

248
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:32,268
Makes me feel like I'm
in the South of France.

249
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:34,563
This doesn't look like
the South of France to me.

250
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:37,458
We can pretend, right?

251
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,110
It's what we do.

252
00:13:42,538 --> 00:13:43,859
If this doesn't work,

253
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:47,492
I've got a little helper in my handbag
you can take to calm those nerves.

254
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,161
It's that obvious?

255
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:50,786
That you're new,

256
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:53,247
it's your first party,
and you're freaking out?

257
00:13:53,851 --> 00:13:55,925
Honey, on nights like
this, it's best to just...

258
00:13:56,588 --> 00:13:57,836
go with the flow.

259
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:00,940
What does that mean exactly?

260
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,873
Anything can happen.

261
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:04,861
Sometimes the guys like to

262
00:14:05,257 --> 00:14:06,636
keep things one-on-one,

263
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:08,888
other times they like
to watch us together.

264
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:12,764
Don't worry.

265
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,895
I'll look out for you.

266
00:14:16,471 --> 00:14:17,625
Thank you.

267
00:14:24,684 --> 00:14:26,888
I told Ella not
to pull you out of the game.

268
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:30,160
Oh, please. At WPK,
clients come before Kobe.

269
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:33,329
- And it's preseason, right?
- Yeah. You a basketball fan?

270
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:35,159
I think once
they finally trade Sasha,

271
00:14:35,284 --> 00:14:37,292
the Lakers will be the best team
in the league.

272
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,460
- I agree.
- Oh, good.

273
00:14:39,684 --> 00:14:42,172
You two should definitely
swap stats later.

274
00:14:42,773 --> 00:14:46,042
Look, can we just focus
on the fashion emergency here?

275
00:14:46,588 --> 00:14:48,928
Maybe Caleb can weigh in
on the Riley of it all?

276
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:50,972
Right, right.
Riley Richmond.

277
00:14:51,302 --> 00:14:52,515
What's the deal?

278
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:56,192
When I saw her, something
just clicked, all right?

279
00:14:56,317 --> 00:14:59,271
I've been selling Real Denim
using fake people.

280
00:15:00,314 --> 00:15:01,733
Models are real people, too.

281
00:15:02,352 --> 00:15:03,318
These...

282
00:15:05,384 --> 00:15:07,780
They seems so... so wrong.

283
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:10,406
All right, they're not authentic.

284
00:15:10,966 --> 00:15:12,536
I want to try something new.

285
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,580
Real people wearing
Real Denim by Anton V.

286
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,626
So, you want
to abandon your entire campaign?

287
00:15:25,604 --> 00:15:26,633
I like the instinct.

288
00:15:26,883 --> 00:15:27,643
A lot.

289
00:15:28,353 --> 00:15:29,594
The press will eat it up.

290
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,179
We can make that happen.

291
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:32,399
Fantastic.

292
00:15:33,526 --> 00:15:35,767
- I will see you tomorrow?
- Sounds good.

293
00:15:37,152 --> 00:15:39,543
And if I hurry, I'll still make
the third quarter.

294
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,399
We're publicists.

295
00:15:43,414 --> 00:15:45,653
It's our job
to protect Anton's image.

296
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,821
This epiphany he's having
could destroy it, and his brand.

297
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,157
I think he's on to something here.

298
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:54,658
Riley is not a model.
She a first grade teacher.

299
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,412
That's Anton's favorite part.

300
00:15:56,584 --> 00:15:58,925
I understand that
he may have been charmed

301
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,416
when she skipped in here

302
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:02,715
all rumpled and rosy,
but she is a novice.

303
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,997
Hiring her for a national
campaign is a huge mistake.

304
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:09,259
The wholesome teacher persona
gives us a great angle to play.

305
00:16:09,603 --> 00:16:11,517
Have her here
first thing tomorrow morning.

306
00:16:41,491 --> 00:16:43,910
Look. There's a doctor in the house.

307
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:46,326
I happened to be
in the area, so

308
00:16:46,451 --> 00:16:48,005
I'd stop by
for that drink.

309
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:51,192
After a long day at the hospital,
you definitely deserve one.

310
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,720
How many lives did you save today?

311
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:55,387
Oh, three.

312
00:16:55,584 --> 00:16:57,098
You must be starving.

313
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,650
The nectarine burrata
salad is my favorite.

314
00:17:03,058 --> 00:17:05,189
But the foie gras.
I'm going to get you both.

315
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,191
You don't need to do that.
A drink is fine.

316
00:17:07,316 --> 00:17:08,525
You took care of me earlier.

317
00:17:08,817 --> 00:17:10,669
Now I'm gonna take care of you.

318
00:17:14,637 --> 00:17:16,534
I could attempt to
warm up these samosas.

319
00:17:16,783 --> 00:17:18,259
Why did you buy them again?

320
00:17:18,384 --> 00:17:19,925
That was when I thought

321
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,207
we should maybe hit Goa
on our honeymoon,

322
00:17:22,451 --> 00:17:24,629
but now I'm thinking maybe Big Sur.

323
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:27,514
Really?

324
00:17:28,621 --> 00:17:30,029
Is it as romantic?

325
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:33,693
Oh, my gosh,
it'll be even more romantic.

326
00:17:34,605 --> 00:17:36,763
The rugged California coastline,

327
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:39,037
and scenic hikes,

328
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:41,388
and sunsets.

329
00:17:42,324 --> 00:17:43,603
Time to celebrate

330
00:17:43,817 --> 00:17:47,107
with the official beverage
of models everywhere.

331
00:17:47,384 --> 00:17:48,565
Celebrate what?

332
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,610
Fashion debut of Riley Richmond.

333
00:17:52,286 --> 00:17:54,541
Anton V wants you

334
00:17:54,896 --> 00:17:56,727
to model for his new line.

335
00:17:57,738 --> 00:17:58,531
What?

336
00:17:58,656 --> 00:18:02,259
Okay, I've had a really long day, and
I'm not in the mood to be mocked.

337
00:18:02,587 --> 00:18:03,331
I...

338
00:18:03,948 --> 00:18:06,376
am as serious
as a shoe sale at Barney's.

339
00:18:07,775 --> 00:18:10,504
I don't understand.
Anton knows I'm not a model.

340
00:18:10,684 --> 00:18:13,007
And that is exactly
why he wants you.

341
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,658
Riles, this is, like,
more than amazing.

342
00:18:18,655 --> 00:18:20,691
You know I hate being
the center of attention.

343
00:18:20,992 --> 00:18:22,774
Public speaking gives me hives.

344
00:18:22,899 --> 00:18:25,061
I always had to be in the
chorus in school plays.

345
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:28,272
And besides you, the people I'm comfortable
standing up in front of are six-year-olds.

346
00:18:28,451 --> 00:18:31,608
Riley, this is every girl's
dream come true.

347
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,192
You want
to make my dreams come true?

348
00:18:34,317 --> 00:18:36,517
Reinstate the arts programs
at my school.

349
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,242
Okay, you

350
00:18:39,835 --> 00:18:41,052
will be shot by

351
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,559
a world-class photographer,
hair and makeup done

352
00:18:44,684 --> 00:18:46,400
by the best artists in the business.

353
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,089
Your face

354
00:18:48,717 --> 00:18:50,965
will be on national magazines.

355
00:18:52,217 --> 00:18:55,508
I mean, I would so buy
out the entire newsstand.

356
00:18:56,224 --> 00:18:58,011
Fittings start tomorrow.

357
00:18:58,251 --> 00:18:59,907
No, I don't know.

358
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,692
I'm sorry. What's not to know?
It's, like, five days of work,

359
00:19:04,153 --> 00:19:06,422
and I'll ballpark it
around ten grand.

360
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:09,162
What?!

361
00:19:09,845 --> 00:19:11,092
$10,000?!

362
00:19:12,517 --> 00:19:14,235
This is the real deal, people.

363
00:19:14,451 --> 00:19:16,780
Come on. It's better
than handing out

364
00:19:16,984 --> 00:19:18,782
juice boxes at the day care center.

365
00:19:19,706 --> 00:19:20,909
I teach first grade.

366
00:19:21,862 --> 00:19:24,259
And what you are
asking me to do means

367
00:19:24,384 --> 00:19:25,859
taking a whole week off work.

368
00:19:25,984 --> 00:19:28,679
My class has tests,
projects, trips planned.

369
00:19:28,804 --> 00:19:30,692
I mean, those kids spend
more time with me

370
00:19:30,817 --> 00:19:33,338
than they do with their parents.
They depend on me showing up.

371
00:19:33,618 --> 00:19:35,792
Kids are resilient.
They'll get over it.

372
00:19:36,403 --> 00:19:38,885
I mean, little tykes are...
they're tough.

373
00:19:39,117 --> 00:19:41,625
See? Even the groom-to-be
thinks you should do it.

374
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,089
Right, Jonah?

375
00:19:43,389 --> 00:19:44,182
What?

376
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,433
No, I think

377
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,825
you would make an amazing model.

378
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:48,992
Amazing.

379
00:19:49,117 --> 00:19:50,658
But it's definitely...

380
00:19:50,783 --> 00:19:51,897
It's your choice.

381
00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:54,893
Guys, the answer is no.

382
00:19:58,661 --> 00:20:00,137
Honestly, Riley?

383
00:20:03,978 --> 00:20:05,338
This is so selfish.

384
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:12,001
So who are these guys?

385
00:20:13,284 --> 00:20:16,459
Another tip: that's a question
you're never supposed to ask.

386
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:18,925
Meaning I don't want to know?

387
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,926
From what I've overheard,

388
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:23,346
they run some kind of
import-exports thing,

389
00:20:24,187 --> 00:20:26,414
and I'm pretty sure it's not legal.

390
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,317
Then again, neither is what we do.

391
00:21:12,582 --> 00:21:13,963
I'm here for Hassan.

392
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:17,044
- How you doing?
- Right this way.

393
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,905
You must be David.

394
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:23,072
I'm Hassan.

395
00:21:23,606 --> 00:21:25,952
Amir tells me you're quite
the art aficionado.

396
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:27,535
He says the same about you.

397
00:21:28,365 --> 00:21:30,388
You should get yourself a drink.

398
00:21:31,648 --> 00:21:32,658
Thank you.

399
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:34,357
Get to know the girls.

400
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,292
Come here, come here.

401
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:41,507
Look who's getting
into the spirit of the evening.

402
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:46,526
Just between you and me,

403
00:21:46,651 --> 00:21:49,059
I've never gone pro.

404
00:21:49,444 --> 00:21:52,136
Consider tonight my gift to you.

405
00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:53,992
Now, what's your type?

406
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:55,479
I have to get off this boat.

407
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:56,272
Why?

408
00:21:57,384 --> 00:21:58,593
That guy's my neighbor.

409
00:21:58,718 --> 00:22:00,925
Don't look!
The blonde.

410
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,259
Leather jacket.

411
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:03,792
He can't know I'm here.

412
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,459
Well, why don't you
find yourself a girl,

413
00:22:06,584 --> 00:22:07,991
and have some fun?

414
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,059
You realize Wendi will seriously
lose it if you bail?

415
00:22:33,184 --> 00:22:35,992
Staying's not an option.
Okay? I'll deal with Wendi.

416
00:22:36,117 --> 00:22:37,593
I need you to help me.

417
00:22:38,169 --> 00:22:39,084
Please?

418
00:22:45,795 --> 00:22:46,835
Come here.

419
00:22:56,451 --> 00:22:57,624
Excuse me.

420
00:23:05,439 --> 00:23:06,625
To new friends.

421
00:23:07,765 --> 00:23:08,892
What was that?

422
00:23:09,017 --> 00:23:10,262
Our best anejo.

423
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:14,192
I am not letting you take all
these drinks out of your paycheck.

424
00:23:15,301 --> 00:23:16,126
I told you.

425
00:23:16,522 --> 00:23:17,684
On the house.

426
00:23:18,088 --> 00:23:19,484
I'm taking care of you.

427
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,817
All right, as long as later,
you'll let

428
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:24,151
me take care of you

429
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:26,737
with a very big tip.

430
00:23:29,152 --> 00:23:30,157
Excuse me.

431
00:23:35,797 --> 00:23:36,753
Hi, honey.

432
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,493
I know, I should've called.

433
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:40,226
Noah is out of control.

434
00:23:41,917 --> 00:23:44,226
The new girl
is not exactly working out,

435
00:23:44,351 --> 00:23:46,924
and Leticia is going to be
in Ecuador for another week.

436
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:50,269
I put a call into Larchmont Staffing
for temp sitters today.

437
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:53,517
I hear music.
Where are you?

438
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:55,792
At that Italian place
across the street.

439
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:57,493
It's Rob's birthday.

440
00:23:57,729 --> 00:24:00,326
Babe, look, surgery's one thing,
okay, but a party?

441
00:24:00,451 --> 00:24:02,532
Come home. I need help.

442
00:24:03,606 --> 00:24:05,618
All right.
I'm on my way.

443
00:24:07,693 --> 00:24:10,226
I invented a drink just for you.

444
00:24:10,805 --> 00:24:14,868
The M.D., because after you drink it,
you're gonna need one.

445
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,339
You gotta go?

446
00:24:20,719 --> 00:24:23,159
And I'm really sorry, Violet,
because...

447
00:24:23,936 --> 00:24:25,462
I had a really great time.

448
00:24:43,783 --> 00:24:45,326
So you said "surprise me."

449
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:47,192
I rose to the occasion:

450
00:24:48,209 --> 00:24:50,587
the pineapple/peanut butter combo.

451
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,092
Could be genius.
Could be deadly.

452
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:56,126
I just checked my messages
and there was one

453
00:24:56,251 --> 00:24:58,359
from the property
management company.

454
00:24:58,786 --> 00:25:00,372
Our rent check bounced.

455
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:04,658
Actually, your rent check bounced.

456
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:06,458
There's money in the account.

457
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:09,925
I deposited the check from
the Weisburg bris last week.

458
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,301
There must be
a glitch or something, I don't know.

459
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,493
It was a week ago.
It should have cleared.

460
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:17,597
Don't worry about it. It's all good.
I'll call the bank and clear it up.

461
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:22,059
But don't tell me
this doesn't look delicious.

462
00:25:22,314 --> 00:25:24,159
Do you want to cuddle
and watch a movie?

463
00:25:24,284 --> 00:25:26,025
I think Princess Bride's on cable.

464
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:28,692
I wish. I can't. I've got to finish
editing Anton's opus.

465
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:30,092
I told him I'd deliver it tomorrow.

466
00:25:30,217 --> 00:25:30,956
Okay.

467
00:25:36,872 --> 00:25:37,965
Pineapple-PB?

468
00:25:39,006 --> 00:25:39,881
Genius.

469
00:25:40,979 --> 00:25:42,072
So good.

470
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:10,551
It's my responsibility
as a bartender

471
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:12,820
to make sure you're okay to drive.

472
00:26:13,184 --> 00:26:15,294
And I take my job very seriously.

473
00:26:16,455 --> 00:26:18,551
Then I guess I could
use a little fresh air.

474
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,117
I've never seen a car
like this before.

475
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:29,792
I might be crazy,

476
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:33,215
but I think there's something
you've been wanting to do all night.

477
00:26:34,096 --> 00:26:35,094
Oh, really?

478
00:26:35,618 --> 00:26:37,025
What would that be?

479
00:26:37,443 --> 00:26:38,714
You're a doctor.

480
00:26:39,851 --> 00:26:41,382
Now, make me feel better.

481
00:27:11,136 --> 00:27:13,460
So, you think you can line
up a buyer for the sculpture?

482
00:27:15,148 --> 00:27:16,405
Forget the sculpture.

483
00:27:16,815 --> 00:27:19,177
Let's talk about the
Egyptian antiquity

484
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:23,135
that came into the cit
valued at $2.2 million.

485
00:27:24,196 --> 00:27:25,526
It's at a home in Bel Air.

486
00:27:25,836 --> 00:27:28,350
And since Amir tells me
you're the best,

487
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,931
I want you to bring it to me.

488
00:27:37,217 --> 00:27:40,407
It sounds like a great opportunity,
but I work alone.

489
00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:43,202
Oh, a small, yet

490
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:45,955
independent businessman.
That's nice.

491
00:27:49,317 --> 00:27:51,543
People don't usually turn me down.

492
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:52,825
Nothing personal.

493
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,892
There's just too many things
that can go wrong.

494
00:27:55,017 --> 00:27:56,625
I need to be the one in control.

495
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:59,260
You show up tonight.
You ate my food,

496
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:01,426
enjoyed my women,
and then you turn down.

497
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:04,223
- My offer to do business?
- I draw the line at playing fetch.

498
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:08,658
Amir told me you were be stubborn,

499
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:10,980
but he failed to mention
you were stupid.

500
00:28:13,251 --> 00:28:15,259
I guess we're going to have
to teach you a lesson.

501
00:28:15,384 --> 00:28:16,776
Get the hell out of my way.

502
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,825
You, my friend,

503
00:28:24,687 --> 00:28:26,259
need to learn some respect.

504
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,144
What happened?

505
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,797
I borrowed a buddy of mine's bike,

506
00:28:54,258 --> 00:28:56,784
took it up Angel's Crest
and spun it out.

507
00:28:58,227 --> 00:29:00,013
I must've hit my head.
Passed out.

508
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,559
Let me look at it.

509
00:29:04,601 --> 00:29:05,409
I'm fine.

510
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:07,590
No, you're not.

511
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:11,532
Labored breathing can mean internal
bleeding, plus a possible concussion.

512
00:29:11,657 --> 00:29:13,042
You need to go to a hospital.

513
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,794
I'm gonna sleep it off.

514
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:18,503
No. You're not slipping
into a coma on my watch.

515
00:29:19,817 --> 00:29:21,675
I'm taking you to a hospital.

516
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,434
It's all there, $5,500.

517
00:29:35,183 --> 00:29:37,316
You're turning
into a majorly fast runner.

518
00:29:38,408 --> 00:29:39,649
What's the money for?

519
00:29:39,774 --> 00:29:41,369
The EX3. Sweet deal.

520
00:29:41,494 --> 00:29:42,517
Thanks, buddy.

521
00:29:42,642 --> 00:29:43,921
You're selling your camera?

522
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,075
I put it on Craigslist last night.

523
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,009
But you need that for work.
You love that camera.

524
00:29:49,034 --> 00:29:50,414
Okay, thanks, dude.

525
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:53,896
No, I don't know what's going on here,
but this is not for sale.

526
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:56,182
What? I just drove
all the way from Alta Dena.

527
00:29:57,294 --> 00:29:58,552
I'm really sorry.

528
00:29:59,617 --> 00:30:00,851
What are you doing?

529
00:30:01,724 --> 00:30:03,555
Okay, what was tha all about?

530
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,615
It's just that camera's
almost a year old.

531
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,595
I just figured I sell it
and get a new one.

532
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,763
You got to keep up
with the latest technologies.

533
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:12,017
Jonah... the truth?

534
00:30:19,055 --> 00:30:20,080
The truth is that

535
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,958
my bank account
is dwindling rapidly.

536
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:25,159
And pretty soon, I'm going
to be in real trouble.

537
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:27,276
What? How is that possible?

538
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:31,533
I mean, people a cutting back
and they're recording things themselves.

539
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,553
I've been working.

540
00:30:33,935 --> 00:30:35,541
I've had to cut my rates, though,

541
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,668
like a lot, just
to even get the jobs.

542
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,111
So, that EX3, that could get me
through the next couple of months.

543
00:30:46,384 --> 00:30:47,636
If we need the money...

544
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,592
No, no. This is...
it's my problem to fix, okay?

545
00:30:50,888 --> 00:30:53,192
I mean, I'm trying
to be this guy with a job

546
00:30:53,317 --> 00:30:54,712
and steady money and...

547
00:30:55,715 --> 00:30:58,559
I had a plan, okay?
This great plan.

548
00:30:58,684 --> 00:31:00,763
It's just not panning out
the way I thought it would.

549
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,001
Okay, this mig come as a shocker,

550
00:31:06,551 --> 00:31:08,762
but I'm not marrying you
for your money.

551
00:31:09,819 --> 00:31:12,660
Jonah, if you have a problem
I want to know about it.

552
00:31:12,951 --> 00:31:13,954
Always.

553
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,126
Okay. I just...

554
00:31:20,184 --> 00:31:22,025
I-I thought could fix things

555
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,165
and come up with this

556
00:31:24,584 --> 00:31:26,050
brilliant plan.

557
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,259
We'll come up with a brilliant plan.

558
00:31:28,384 --> 00:31:29,345
Together.

559
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,328
Hope that text about the schoolteacher
was some kind of joke.

560
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:52,222
Like you wearing your
shades in the office.

561
00:31:52,717 --> 00:31:54,492
I need something to shield me

562
00:31:54,617 --> 00:31:56,225
from tho Paul Smith pastels.

563
00:31:56,658 --> 00:31:59,166
Riley Richmo turned us down.

564
00:32:00,429 --> 00:32:02,592
Don't put you off night on WPK.

565
00:32:02,717 --> 00:32:05,756
She turned you down.
So you're going to tell the client.

566
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:09,134
You do realize I got five
messages from Anton V?

567
00:32:09,484 --> 00:32:11,820
He's got big plans
for Riley Richmond

568
00:32:11,945 --> 00:32:13,535
wearing his Real Denim.

569
00:32:13,951 --> 00:32:15,359
Crushing his dreams...

570
00:32:15,484 --> 00:32:17,017
not exactly the opening
I had in mind.

571
00:32:18,331 --> 00:32:21,590
I have my feelers out
to some incredibly attractive,

572
00:32:21,715 --> 00:32:23,983
interesting... real people.

573
00:32:25,036 --> 00:32:26,225
We'll make sure Anton forgets

574
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,793
all about that
boring public schoolteacher.

575
00:32:35,007 --> 00:32:35,995
Who's this?

576
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,178
Riley Richmond
I hope I'm not too late.

577
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,687
Is the modeling job still available?

578
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:55,388
What the hell happened to you?

579
00:32:55,862 --> 00:32:57,015
I tripped.

580
00:32:57,478 --> 00:32:58,352
Right.

581
00:32:59,126 --> 00:33:00,343
What did you do,

582
00:33:00,651 --> 00:33:02,225
get caught going after
another painting?

583
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:03,484
Right over here.

584
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,652
I ordered the X-rays.

585
00:33:10,357 --> 00:33:12,292
It's not as zippy as a motorcycle,

586
00:33:13,035 --> 00:33:14,282
but it's safer.

587
00:33:15,817 --> 00:33:17,125
You got to be kidding me.

588
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,180
It's house rules. Come on.
Hop in.

589
00:33:20,078 --> 00:33:21,584
Come on.
I'll walk.

590
00:33:26,326 --> 00:33:28,921
You know I expect full disclosure
from all members of my team.

591
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:32,592
You want to tell me
what went on last night?

592
00:33:33,275 --> 00:33:34,526
I don't have any details.

593
00:33:34,651 --> 00:33:36,554
He was in pretty bad shape
when I found him...

594
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:39,266
When you find out the truth,
you come straight to me.

595
00:33:42,517 --> 00:33:43,686
I'm worried about my son.

596
00:33:44,645 --> 00:33:45,951
Of course, Dr. Mancini.

597
00:33:52,857 --> 00:33:55,726
Ella, you're the best. Thank you
for bringing me the perfect girl.

598
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:00,328
If imakes you happy,
it makes me happy.

599
00:34:00,498 --> 00:34:01,829
Here it is.

600
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:04,225
The Anton V electronic press kit.

601
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,376
Let the denim revolution begin.

602
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:07,427
Nice.

603
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:13,592
Oh, my God.

604
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:19,492
You're really doing this?

605
00:34:24,584 --> 00:34:28,315
And this is getting a little too cute
for comfort. I'm going to grab a latte.

606
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,860
After much mulling,

607
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,826
self-scrutiny, and practice

608
00:34:34,951 --> 00:34:37,114
posing in front
the bathroom mirror...

609
00:34:37,987 --> 00:34:39,659
I decided to give this a try.

610
00:34:41,173 --> 00:34:42,659
What about your...

611
00:34:42,784 --> 00:34:44,415
your class and the tests and...

612
00:34:44,584 --> 00:34:47,943
- and the trips?
- They're in good hands with Mr. Hammock.

613
00:34:48,284 --> 00:34:50,087
I just hope they don't
forget all about me.

614
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:52,513
Impossible.

615
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:56,480
Wait, Riles, are...

616
00:34:57,932 --> 00:35:00,014
Are you okay with this?
Because if you are even...

617
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,392
No, this is our life, Jonah.

618
00:35:02,951 --> 00:35:04,018
And it's real.

619
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:08,050
There are going to be rough patches.

620
00:35:10,059 --> 00:35:11,775
We're in it together now.

621
00:35:13,687 --> 00:35:14,826
Look, I-I...

622
00:35:14,951 --> 00:35:16,780
I called all the leads
I had this morning.

623
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:19,532
I'm going to drum some business

624
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:21,459
- if it kills me.
- I'm not worried.

625
00:35:21,584 --> 00:35:23,058
It's only a matter of time

626
00:35:23,183 --> 00:35:25,122
before Hollywood comes calling
for Jonah Miller.

627
00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:29,626
But you never need
to hide things from me.

628
00:35:30,504 --> 00:35:32,171
No matter what it is,
I can handle it.

629
00:35:33,469 --> 00:35:34,965
I know you can.

630
00:35:40,495 --> 00:35:41,763
And... you look

631
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:43,626
unbelievable in these jeans.

632
00:35:43,751 --> 00:35:45,099
- Really ?
- Yeah.

633
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:52,125
Anton, good news.

634
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,125
I got Lifetime, Bravo

635
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,110
and the Style Network
chomping at the bit.

636
00:35:56,552 --> 00:35:57,987
I owe it all to WPK.

637
00:35:58,617 --> 00:36:01,449
Seriously, man it's been great working
with people who support my vision.

638
00:36:03,357 --> 00:36:04,204
And...

639
00:36:05,217 --> 00:36:06,829
I think we should celebrate.

640
00:36:07,735 --> 00:36:09,292
Dinner this evening?

641
00:36:10,029 --> 00:36:12,392
I got a standing reservation
at Church & Stat Great.

642
00:36:13,616 --> 00:36:15,546
I'm craving
the steak tartare already.

643
00:36:17,018 --> 00:36:18,050
Me, too.

644
00:36:20,484 --> 00:36:22,762
I've seen a lot of motorcycle
crash victims.

645
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:25,708
Theirs skin usuall
looks like hamburger.

646
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,852
Your injuries are completely
inconsistent with your story.

647
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:31,562
You want to tell me what
actually happened last night?

648
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:34,192
I told you I didn't need to co
to the hospital, all right?

649
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,958
- So stop with the interrogation.
- You're lucky

650
00:36:36,153 --> 00:36:38,362
I took X-rays, because you
have a fractured rib.

651
00:36:39,795 --> 00:36:42,651
I'm only asking you so I can give you
proper medical care.

652
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,454
I got in a fight.

653
00:36:49,484 --> 00:36:50,498
With who?

654
00:36:53,938 --> 00:36:54,867
Just a guy.

655
00:36:55,918 --> 00:36:57,494
It was an ugly situation.

656
00:37:01,984 --> 00:37:04,359
Not all of us can be
out there acing exams and saving

657
00:37:04,484 --> 00:37:06,974
lives like the perfect
Lauren Yung, all right?

658
00:37:12,217 --> 00:37:14,940
I'll be back in a minute
to tape up your rib.

659
00:37:23,665 --> 00:37:26,467
Wendi, I am so sorry
about last night.

660
00:37:26,784 --> 00:37:29,627
Lauren, I didn't call
to hear excuses.

661
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:32,359
Then how about the truth?

662
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:34,959
My neighbor was on that boat.
I couldn't let him find out

663
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,159
about me.

664
00:37:36,284 --> 00:37:37,879
The same thing happened to me once.

665
00:37:38,049 --> 00:37:39,925
I was in a hotel bar with a client,

666
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:42,559
and in walks my straighter
than straight roommate.

667
00:37:42,762 --> 00:37:45,025
What'd you do?
I walked right up to her,

668
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:47,579
told her I was on a date
with a college professor.

669
00:37:47,704 --> 00:37:49,515
Finished my drink
then finished my job,

670
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,185
- because I'm not a quitter.
- I didn't quit.

671
00:37:52,355 --> 00:37:54,426
You took the easy way out.

672
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:57,692
I've never taken the easy
way out in my life.

673
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,859
If I thought you were lying to me,

674
00:38:00,029 --> 00:38:01,859
I'd have fired you.

675
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:04,030
But I'm going to give you
another chance.

676
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,157
You owe me, and, Lauren...

677
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,826
I never forget a debt.

678
00:38:17,217 --> 00:38:19,058
Oh, you look exhausted.

679
00:38:19,183 --> 00:38:21,592
I can't believe they called
you in for a bypass last night.

680
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:23,292
- Where's Noah?
- He's in

681
00:38:23,417 --> 00:38:26,159
- with a babysitter I'm interviewing.
- You found someone?

682
00:38:26,284 --> 00:38:28,626
She registered at the
Larchmont Agency this morning.

683
00:38:28,751 --> 00:38:30,592
I'm just interviewin
her right now, but, 

684
00:38:31,181 --> 00:38:33,150
I think she migh be perfect.

685
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:46,656
What the hell are you
doing in my house?

686
00:38:47,465 --> 00:38:48,353
Relax.

687
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,117
I don't want the nanny job.

688
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:53,692
The minute I saw the way

689
00:38:53,817 --> 00:38:55,726
you looked at me in your office,

690
00:38:56,527 --> 00:38:58,559
I knew you were your
own worst enemy.

691
00:38:58,684 --> 00:39:01,254
- My mother was right.
- What the hell are you talking about?

692
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:03,392
I told you I was adopted.

693
00:39:03,517 --> 00:39:05,292
And when I found my real mom,

694
00:39:05,417 --> 00:39:07,692
she was a mess, all because of you.

695
00:39:07,888 --> 00:39:09,220
I never got a chance to know

696
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,759
my mother because what
you did to he Your mother?

697
00:39:11,934 --> 00:39:14,141
- What was she, a patient?
- My mom

698
00:39:14,317 --> 00:39:16,311
was Sydney Andrews.

699
00:39:18,117 --> 00:39:19,992
I know you don't think
I'm your father,

700
00:39:20,117 --> 00:39:21,650
so what do y want from me?

701
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:27,992
You hurt my mother.

702
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:30,370
She was trying to get better,
but you wouldn't let her.

703
00:39:32,646 --> 00:39:33,671
