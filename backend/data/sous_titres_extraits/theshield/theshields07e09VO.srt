1
00:01:14,495 --> 00:01:16,905
Looks like
he must have split in a hurry.

2
00:01:18,499 --> 00:01:20,519
Shane's had plenty of time
since killing Lem

3
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:22,243
to figure out an exit strategy.

4
00:01:22,503 --> 00:01:24,913
You have any intel
on what Shane's driving?

5
00:01:25,529 --> 00:01:28,184
Downtown found his truck
a couple hours ago.

6
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:30,251
Unis have the plate numbers
from Mara's Lexus.

7
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:32,205
Think he'll head south?

8
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:34,910
Shane knows the first place
we'd look is Mexico.

9
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,259
Only question is if he's stupid
enough to go there anyway.

10
00:01:38,943 --> 00:01:40,929
See anything?

11
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:43,475
Couple of photos missing
from their frames.

12
00:01:43,832 --> 00:01:46,132
Hey, check this out.

13
00:01:46,199 --> 00:01:48,765
Prescription for Jackson.

14
00:01:48,832 --> 00:01:50,199
"Amoxicillin.

15
00:01:50,264 --> 00:01:53,765
Take one teaspoon
two times daily for pertussis."

16
00:01:53,832 --> 00:01:55,165
Yesterday's date.

17
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:57,398
If Jackson's sick, they might
need to refill that soon.

18
00:01:57,465 --> 00:01:59,932
You keep gathering police intel
for Mara's phone call.

19
00:01:59,998 --> 00:02:02,331
We'll keep feeding them whatever
they need to hear

20
00:02:02,398 --> 00:02:04,531
until we find them.

21
00:02:04,598 --> 00:02:06,465
Well, then what?

22
00:02:06,531 --> 00:02:09,231
What if we don't find him alone?
What if Mara's with him?

23
00:02:09,298 --> 00:02:11,898
What, you mean his accomplice?
Mara's not an innocent.

24
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,331
She's pregnant,
and the kid's 2.

25
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,765
That's a decision for when
we need to make a decision.

26
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:30,199
Does Lloyd ever let new people
into his life?

27
00:02:30,264 --> 00:02:34,331
Teenage kid? Doesn't take much
to scare a man away.

28
00:02:34,398 --> 00:02:37,998
I started seeing somebody
too soon after Chuck left,

29
00:02:38,065 --> 00:02:41,032
and I don't think Lloyd
really liked that too much.

30
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:42,231
What'd he do?

31
00:02:42,298 --> 00:02:44,598
Well, it was one
of Lloyd's teachers

32
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,965
when we lived back in tulsa,
and...

33
00:02:47,032 --> 00:02:49,965
you know what?
I don't want to talk about this.

34
00:02:50,032 --> 00:02:51,865
I don't want to ruin
a lovely evening.

35
00:02:52,035 --> 00:02:55,698
Sure, but if you ever want to
sometime...

36
00:02:55,765 --> 00:03:01,598
this guy went after Lloyd...
pushed him around.

37
00:03:01,768 --> 00:03:03,631
It was really awful.

38
00:03:03,698 --> 00:03:06,364
Wow.
Well, what caused that?

39
00:03:10,832 --> 00:03:12,998
Let's save that
for next time.

40
00:03:13,168 --> 00:03:15,199
Does Lloyd have any trouble

41
00:03:15,264 --> 00:03:18,531
getting back into his schoolwork
since...

42
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:22,065
Iloyd adjusts easily
with all this moving around.

43
00:03:22,132 --> 00:03:24,364
It's just...

44
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,765
we shouldn't do this.

45
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,231
We shouldn't?

46
00:03:39,298 --> 00:03:41,765
This is an... an, uh...
an open case.

47
00:03:41,832 --> 00:03:45,032
It's still, um...
it's not right.

48
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,665
It's crossing the line.

49
00:03:46,732 --> 00:03:48,665
Wasn't this a date?
A good one?

50
00:03:53,665 --> 00:03:55,099
Um...

51
00:03:55,165 --> 00:03:57,032
ri... I'm... I'm sorry.

52
00:03:57,099 --> 00:03:58,331
I can't do this.

53
00:03:58,398 --> 00:04:01,065
I'm... it's not a good idea,
Rita. I'm sorry.

54
00:04:01,132 --> 00:04:03,665
I'm very sorry.
I can't handle this, really.

55
00:04:03,732 --> 00:04:04,965
Please don't.

56
00:04:05,032 --> 00:04:08,865
I think we should wait,
given the circumstances,

57
00:04:08,932 --> 00:04:11,099
get some distance between us
and the case,

58
00:04:11,165 --> 00:04:12,765
then in the future,

59
00:04:12,832 --> 00:04:15,932
I-I can... I can definitely
see something happening.

60
00:04:18,398 --> 00:04:21,032
Detective Vic Mackey,
Farmington division.

61
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:22,898
How can I help you,
detective?

62
00:04:22,965 --> 00:04:24,331
Well, can you tell me

63
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:26,898
what these antibiotics
are used to treat?

64
00:04:26,965 --> 00:04:30,298
Oh. Pertussis
is whooping cough.

65
00:04:30,364 --> 00:04:32,898
Can you check if any
of the local pharmacies

66
00:04:32,965 --> 00:04:35,965
have refilled this prescription
in the last 24 hours?

67
00:04:36,032 --> 00:04:38,032
Well, medical records
are private.

68
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:39,264
Oh, I know. I know.

69
00:04:39,331 --> 00:04:40,898
We're just trying
to track down a killer

70
00:04:40,965 --> 00:04:42,132
before he leaves the country.

71
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,065
I was hoping you could give us
a head start.

72
00:04:44,132 --> 00:04:46,798
Well, I'd be happy
to help you, detective,

73
00:04:46,865 --> 00:04:49,732
if you could come back
with a subpoena.

74
00:04:49,798 --> 00:04:52,331
Do you have
any other police I. D?

75
00:04:52,398 --> 00:04:55,598
I, uh... I left my badge
in my squad house.

76
00:04:55,665 --> 00:04:57,565
Sorry, I can't help you.

77
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:01,231
I'll be happy to call your boss,
let him know why.

78
00:05:03,732 --> 00:05:05,898
No, that won't
be necessary.

79
00:05:05,965 --> 00:05:07,565
Thanks.

80
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:10,264
Every law enforcement agency
statewide

81
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:12,364
has a description
of Vendrell's vehicles

82
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:14,199
and recent pictures
of the family.

83
00:05:14,264 --> 00:05:16,665
How long you plan
to keep Shane out of the press?

84
00:05:16,732 --> 00:05:18,398
We'd rather have him in cuffs
before word gets out

85
00:05:18,465 --> 00:05:19,865
that he tried
to kill another officer.

86
00:05:19,932 --> 00:05:21,665
24 hours
and we haven't found him,

87
00:05:21,732 --> 00:05:23,498
we'll release his picture
and charges

88
00:05:23,565 --> 00:05:24,765
to get the public's help.

89
00:05:24,832 --> 00:05:26,398
I'd like to be off a desk
by then.

90
00:05:26,465 --> 00:05:27,865
We've already
discussed this.

91
00:05:27,932 --> 00:05:30,199
At least let me roll
on a strike team with Julien.

92
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:32,698
Gangs aren't taking a holiday just because
some... gangs aren't your problem anymore.

93
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:35,331
I'm dismantling
the strike team.

94
00:05:35,398 --> 00:05:37,932
That's not
your decision alone.

95
00:05:37,998 --> 00:05:40,565
You told me I'd have authority
over the Barn.

96
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,465
I'm exercising
that authority.

97
00:05:42,531 --> 00:05:44,765
We've got the highest
arrest rate in Farmington.

98
00:05:44,832 --> 00:05:46,798
Who takes the credit
when we arrest Shane

99
00:05:46,865 --> 00:05:48,631
and haul his corrupt ass in?

100
00:05:48,801 --> 00:05:51,865
You don't blame the whole army
for one soldier's war crimes.

101
00:05:51,932 --> 00:05:54,032
Do I have the authority
or don't I?

102
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:56,698
It's your house. Hope
you're doing the right thing.

103
00:05:56,765 --> 00:05:59,398
Julien, you'll be reassigned
to uniform duty.

104
00:05:59,465 --> 00:06:01,199
Captain,
I've earned the right.

105
00:06:01,264 --> 00:06:02,331
Yes, you did.

106
00:06:02,398 --> 00:06:04,331
When you pass
the detectives' exam,

107
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:06,132
I'll see to it
you're promoted.

108
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,798
In the meantime, Vendrell is
our number-one priority.

109
00:06:11,264 --> 00:06:13,865
When you're cleared for work,
you'll be reassigned.

110
00:06:13,932 --> 00:06:15,431
The strike team is my team
to run.

111
00:06:15,498 --> 00:06:16,565
Give me some new blood.

112
00:06:16,631 --> 00:06:18,732
I've had enough blood.

113
00:06:18,902 --> 00:06:21,732
You don't like it,
put in for a transfer.

114
00:06:26,832 --> 00:06:29,798
I don't like this.

115
00:06:29,865 --> 00:06:31,832
Me either.

116
00:06:31,898 --> 00:06:34,231
Can't let them
get caught.

117
00:06:34,298 --> 00:06:35,798
That's right.

118
00:06:35,865 --> 00:06:38,231
Not gonna help you find them
if somebody's gonna get hurt.

119
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:40,231
Corrine, the last thing
in the world I'm gonna do

120
00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:41,398
is hurt them.

121
00:06:41,465 --> 00:06:42,698
You really expect me
to believe

122
00:06:42,765 --> 00:06:44,099
you're not gonna
want payback?

123
00:06:44,165 --> 00:06:46,264
This isn't about payback.

124
00:06:46,331 --> 00:06:49,932
It's about the father
of your children staying free.

125
00:06:49,998 --> 00:06:52,032
And the best way
we can do that

126
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:55,865
is to keep Shane and Mara
a couple...

127
00:07:01,032 --> 00:07:03,461
you know what to do.
Now, do it.

128
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:05,932
Hello?

129
00:07:05,998 --> 00:07:07,531
Hi, Corrine.
Tell me what you know.

130
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,865
They're holding off releasing
Shane's picture to the press.

131
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:12,965
What else?

132
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,565
All divisions
are involved.

133
00:07:15,631 --> 00:07:18,698
The federal authorities
have been notified.

134
00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:22,498
Your pictures are being released
to borders and airports.

135
00:07:24,665 --> 00:07:27,398
If you give me a 50-mile radius
as to where you are,

136
00:07:27,465 --> 00:07:29,898
Vic can probably get
more detailed information

137
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:31,898
as to exactly
where the police are.

138
00:07:31,965 --> 00:07:34,364
He said if we give him a 50-mile
radius of where we are,

139
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:35,665
they can get
more specifics.

140
00:07:35,732 --> 00:07:37,231
Give me the phone.

141
00:07:37,298 --> 00:07:40,832
Put Vic on.
Now, Corrine. I know he's there.

142
00:07:43,032 --> 00:07:45,598
I'm listening.

143
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:49,264
The deal was my wife speaks
to your ex-wife,

144
00:07:49,331 --> 00:07:51,565
not that you sit in on the call
or coach Corrine

145
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:53,099
on how to pump Mara for intel.

146
00:07:53,165 --> 00:07:54,732
Just looking out
for you, Shane.

147
00:07:54,798 --> 00:07:57,631
You don't want your plan
to go to shit

148
00:07:57,698 --> 00:07:59,898
just like your plan
to kill me and Ronnie.

149
00:07:59,965 --> 00:08:01,832
That plan was solid.
You had no idea.

150
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,798
I just couldn't get the brother
to close the deal with Ronnie.

151
00:08:04,865 --> 00:08:06,965
And you were waiting for me
at my place, weren't you?

152
00:08:07,032 --> 00:08:10,065
Least I had the Sack
to take you out myself.

153
00:08:10,132 --> 00:08:11,631
You're the pussy

154
00:08:11,698 --> 00:08:14,898
who sent some random Mexicans
to rub me out along with Rezian.

155
00:08:14,965 --> 00:08:16,832
What can I do for you now,
Shane?

156
00:08:16,898 --> 00:08:19,032
You can help me steer clear
of the police,

157
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:21,732
so we both don't end up
in prison.

158
00:08:21,798 --> 00:08:23,698
I can't do that
if I don't know

159
00:08:23,765 --> 00:08:25,832
which direction
you're pointed in.

160
00:08:25,898 --> 00:08:27,565
I'm gonna be pointing at you
if I catch you

161
00:08:27,631 --> 00:08:28,965
near any one
of these calls again.

162
00:08:29,032 --> 00:08:30,331
And don't think
I won't be watching.

163
00:08:30,398 --> 00:08:31,732
I'm glad to know it.

164
00:08:31,798 --> 00:08:34,165
Tonight, at 10:00,
when we call this number,

165
00:08:34,231 --> 00:08:36,231
Corrine had better have
some new intel,

166
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,359
what'd he say?
Shane's paranoid.

167
00:08:55,659 --> 00:08:58,559
The sooner we get him
out of the country, the better.

168
00:08:58,625 --> 00:08:59,891
What would happen to Jackson

169
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,192
if he had whooping cough
and he stopped his meds?

170
00:09:02,258 --> 00:09:04,058
If he doesn't get
the right antibiotics,

171
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,958
it could turn into pneumonia,
get dangerous.

172
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:09,425
Here you go.

173
00:09:09,595 --> 00:09:13,158
Claudette shut down
the strike team.

174
00:09:13,225 --> 00:09:14,525
Holy shit.

175
00:09:14,592 --> 00:09:16,659
Another thing that
I've got to thank Shane for

176
00:09:16,726 --> 00:09:17,792
when we catch up to him.

177
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,158
How'd the phone call
with Mara go?

178
00:09:23,225 --> 00:09:25,225
I wasn't able to get a 20.
Here.

179
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:28,225
See if Shane tried to get
this prescription refilled

180
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:29,592
anywhere around here.

181
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:31,759
I'm not getting anywhere
without my goddamn badge.

182
00:09:31,826 --> 00:09:33,858
What are you gonna
work next?

183
00:09:33,925 --> 00:09:36,058
If Shane's got fake I.D. S,
who's the paper man?

184
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,925
How's he financing
this cannonball run?

185
00:09:37,991 --> 00:09:39,958
He didn't ask for cash,
so he must have some.

186
00:09:40,025 --> 00:09:45,025
You know, we assumed that
the Mexicans who killed Rezian

187
00:09:45,092 --> 00:09:46,991
took his 100 grand.

188
00:09:47,058 --> 00:09:48,325
You think
Shane snagged it?

189
00:09:48,392 --> 00:09:51,125
That kind of money
could take him a long way.

190
00:09:51,192 --> 00:09:52,292
Yeah.

191
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:54,058
Here's hoping
Jackson's cough

192
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,092
doesn't take a turn
for the better.

193
00:09:56,158 --> 00:09:57,891
We need to get
out of I.a. Soon.

194
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:00,258
The less moving we do
for the next day or two,

195
00:10:00,325 --> 00:10:01,459
the better off we are.

196
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:08,058
He's still
running a fever, Shane.

197
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,559
Hell, I'm doing
the best I can, Mara.

198
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,158
Iook, we got to get rid
of this car.

199
00:10:13,225 --> 00:10:15,559
Then we can take care
of Jackson.

200
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,659
Well, if that black asshole
you hired had done his job,

201
00:10:17,726 --> 00:10:19,192
then we wouldn't be running
like this.

202
00:10:19,258 --> 00:10:20,826
Yeah, well, I don't get
to pick and choose

203
00:10:20,891 --> 00:10:23,158
which guys I can hang
murder charges over.

204
00:10:23,225 --> 00:10:26,826
This shouldn't take long, okay?
Just wait in the car.

205
00:10:26,891 --> 00:10:28,225
Be careful.

206
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:33,359
Hey, what's the word,
amigo?

207
00:10:36,192 --> 00:10:37,659
Last time
you called me amigo,

208
00:10:37,726 --> 00:10:39,325
I caught a four-month bid
in county.

209
00:10:39,392 --> 00:10:40,925
Hell, it could've been
four years

210
00:10:40,991 --> 00:10:42,359
with the shit
I found on you.

211
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:44,925
You got any cars on this lot
with a clean Vin and papers?

212
00:10:44,991 --> 00:10:46,692
I'm legit.
You want to search my records?

213
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:47,958
I don't have to, redding.

214
00:10:48,025 --> 00:10:49,726
I take three more steps
into this dump,

215
00:10:49,792 --> 00:10:52,125
I'm gonna come across
a boatload of stolen auto parts

216
00:10:52,192 --> 00:10:53,392
with the serials
burned off.

217
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:54,625
What, you want me to call

218
00:10:54,692 --> 00:10:56,325
for an evidence truck
to come down here?

219
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,792
I may have a car
with clean papers.

220
00:11:00,858 --> 00:11:02,492
Today's your lucky day.

221
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:05,092
See that Lexus?
I need to unload that.

222
00:11:05,158 --> 00:11:07,425
Straight-up trade...
no questions asked.

223
00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:10,225
It just can't show up anywhere
where it can be found.

224
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:11,525
So, show me what you got.

225
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:16,858
I got that.

226
00:11:16,925 --> 00:11:19,192
Are you shitting me, man?

227
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:22,991
I'm offering you a Lexus,
for Christ's sakes.

228
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:24,359
She runs, my man.

229
00:11:24,425 --> 00:11:27,692
And it's the only car with
the paperwork that you need.

230
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:30,925
No questions asked,
no calls made.

231
00:11:35,425 --> 00:11:38,625
I was hoping
to never wear blues again.

232
00:11:38,692 --> 00:11:40,525
Hey, Julien.

233
00:11:40,592 --> 00:11:43,559
Captain just told me
we're back riding together.

234
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,025
Need to look
for Vendrell.

235
00:11:45,092 --> 00:11:46,025
Holy shit.

236
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:47,325
Girl takes a long weekend,

237
00:11:47,392 --> 00:11:49,359
and the whole world
starts spinning backwards.

238
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:51,025
Iook, since the captain
benched me,

239
00:11:51,092 --> 00:11:52,792
I'd appreciate
you keeping me in the loop

240
00:11:52,858 --> 00:11:53,958
on the whole Shane thing.

241
00:11:54,025 --> 00:11:55,125
Yeah, sure.

242
00:11:55,192 --> 00:11:57,425
I need to clear that
with Claudette.

243
00:11:57,492 --> 00:11:59,058
Iook,
the guy tried to kill me.

244
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,492
If I can't be in the game,

245
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,692
I'd like to at least
hear the play-by-play.

246
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:05,692
As soon as I run that past the
captain, I will keep you posted.

247
00:12:07,692 --> 00:12:09,559
Okay.

248
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:20,058
This whole thing
is so weird.

249
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,925
Yeah.

250
00:12:25,726 --> 00:12:27,925
¿qué quieres, gringo?

251
00:12:27,991 --> 00:12:29,559
You know
my partner Shane?

252
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,158
Ain't you still got to be a cop
to have a partner?

253
00:12:32,225 --> 00:12:33,559
You think Vic Mackey
loses his job

254
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:34,726
and the streets don't hear
about it?

255
00:12:36,325 --> 00:12:39,592
A few months back, Shane was
in the market for some new I.D.

256
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:42,392
You know anybody who could
make some good passports

257
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:43,759
for him on the quick?

258
00:12:43,826 --> 00:12:45,392
I know
he didn't come to me.

259
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:46,891
I said
they had to be good.

260
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,492
Who?

261
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,058
I don't got to tell ex-cop
shit anymore

262
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,858
now that you got no badge.

263
00:12:52,925 --> 00:12:54,891
I might not
be a cop anymore,

264
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,425
but I'm not
a crooked wetback, either.

265
00:12:57,492 --> 00:12:59,826
Why don't we call some
of my old colleagues,

266
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:02,225
see whose story
they're more interested in...

267
00:13:02,292 --> 00:13:03,891
mine
or your illegal operation.

268
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:08,592
All right,
I might know a name.

269
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:10,459
But then
you're out of favors.

270
00:13:14,991 --> 00:13:17,925
Working on your stamp collection
there, Marcus?

271
00:13:17,991 --> 00:13:20,225
Who are you?
On your feet, shithead.

272
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:25,125
Forging
a federal document...

273
00:13:25,192 --> 00:13:27,325
that's a three-year stretch,
minimum.

274
00:13:27,392 --> 00:13:29,958
Recognize this guy?

275
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:31,858
He's a cop.
Not anymore.

276
00:13:31,925 --> 00:13:33,826
He skipped town
without saying goodbye.

277
00:13:33,891 --> 00:13:35,492
I want to send him
a postcard,

278
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:37,125
but since you gave him
a new name,

279
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:38,459
I don't have an address.

280
00:13:38,525 --> 00:13:40,025
I didn't make him
any papers.

281
00:13:40,092 --> 00:13:42,525
One more lie, and I'm sending
half of you to a hospital.

282
00:13:42,592 --> 00:13:44,425
The other half,
I'm leaving on the floor.

283
00:13:44,492 --> 00:13:46,891
The guy said don't talk
or else.

284
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,659
You don't need to worry
about him anymore.

285
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:52,359
You need to worry
about me.

286
00:13:52,425 --> 00:13:54,991
All right, I made him
three passports, okay?

287
00:13:55,058 --> 00:13:57,559
One for him,
and then one for his wife,

288
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,225
and then one for his kid.

289
00:13:59,292 --> 00:14:00,392
Under what names?

290
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:01,392
Uh...

291
00:14:04,858 --> 00:14:09,125
Shawn and Katie hoover,
and the kid's name is Brian.

292
00:14:14,025 --> 00:14:15,359
That's good quality.

293
00:14:15,425 --> 00:14:16,625
Thanks.

294
00:14:16,692 --> 00:14:18,858
Picture's not in there yet.

295
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:21,425
I was just about
to do that.

296
00:14:21,492 --> 00:14:24,592
I'll spare you
the trouble.

297
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:27,092
Cost of doing business.

298
00:14:28,292 --> 00:14:30,858
He's getting
even hotter, Shane.

299
00:14:30,925 --> 00:14:33,559
Here,
well, maybe we should, uh...

300
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,958
we should run him
a bath again.

301
00:14:40,225 --> 00:14:41,325
Uh, yeah?

302
00:14:41,392 --> 00:14:43,991
Open the door.
Come here, honey.

303
00:14:44,058 --> 00:14:46,158
Okay, just, uh...
just a second.

304
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:51,392
Uh... yeah?

305
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:52,958
Does that kid
ever stop making noise?

306
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,258
Yeah, we're just figuring out
a way to get his medicine.

307
00:14:55,325 --> 00:14:56,392
How about
figure it out quicker?

308
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:57,525
I got jet lag
and a goddamn meeting

309
00:14:57,592 --> 00:14:58,726
I got to get
some sleep for, okay?

310
00:14:58,792 --> 00:15:00,158
Look, man, we're trying
the best we can.

311
00:15:00,225 --> 00:15:01,826
You know, most people wait
till it's dark to go to sleep.

312
00:15:01,891 --> 00:15:02,726
Just shut
the goddamn kid up.

313
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:04,025
Hey, you know what?

314
00:15:04,092 --> 00:15:05,192
Why don't I take a shit
in your goddamn earholes,

315
00:15:05,258 --> 00:15:06,891
give you a little peace
and quiet?

316
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,525
I'm sorry. Our kid has a fever,
and he's miserable.

317
00:15:09,592 --> 00:15:11,292
We're getting him
the medication.

318
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,625
He'll be better,
and he'll be quiet real soon.

319
00:15:13,692 --> 00:15:15,925
I promise.

320
00:15:15,991 --> 00:15:17,592
Appreciate it.

321
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:20,525
Thanks.

322
00:15:20,592 --> 00:15:23,858
Let's just get in the car,
get Jackson's medicine,

323
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:26,625
and get as far away from here
as we can.

324
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,759
You know
why crooks get caught?

325
00:15:28,826 --> 00:15:30,158
Because they move around.

326
00:15:30,225 --> 00:15:31,958
We got to be smarter
than that.

327
00:15:32,025 --> 00:15:33,592
We got to stay
off the roads

328
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:35,559
and out of sight
as much as possible.

329
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,058
For how long?!

330
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,692
Well, right now, Mara, every cop
from Seattle to San diego

331
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,359
is beating the Bush
looking for us.

332
00:15:43,325 --> 00:15:44,559
There's
a presidential motorcade

333
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:45,858
coming through town
this weekend.

334
00:15:45,925 --> 00:15:47,858
It's gonna tie a lot
of those people up.

335
00:15:47,925 --> 00:15:49,225
It's gonna give us
the best shot

336
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:50,792
that we're gonna get
to get out of here,

337
00:15:50,858 --> 00:15:53,359
but until then...

338
00:15:53,425 --> 00:15:55,258
until then,
we just got to hole up here.

339
00:15:55,325 --> 00:15:57,492
We still have to get Jackson
his medicine,

340
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:59,192
so we have to go out
for that.

341
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,925
Only because you left it
at home.

342
00:16:05,826 --> 00:16:07,492
I'll go get his medicine.

343
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:08,625
Come on, buddy.

344
00:16:08,692 --> 00:16:12,025
Steve?

345
00:16:12,092 --> 00:16:13,392
Allison.

346
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:15,058
Hey, mags.

347
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,925
I told you,
don't call me that.

348
00:16:16,991 --> 00:16:18,726
Just happy to see you,
Margaret.

349
00:16:20,392 --> 00:16:23,292
I told you I mailed the check.
I'm sorry it's late again.

350
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:25,325
It's fine.
That's not why we're here.

351
00:16:25,392 --> 00:16:27,258
Anita brohm called me
last week.

352
00:16:27,325 --> 00:16:29,125
Someone moved
into the Lynch house...

353
00:16:29,192 --> 00:16:30,692
single guy,
name's irving heap.

354
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:32,425
Anita looked him up
on the internet.

355
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,991
He's a registered
sex offender.

356
00:16:35,058 --> 00:16:38,192
He molested a teenage girl
in sacramento.

357
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:40,459
Mags,
I'll take care of this.

358
00:16:40,525 --> 00:16:42,792
Don't you worry about this guy,
all right?

359
00:16:42,858 --> 00:16:43,826
It's what I do.

360
00:16:47,826 --> 00:16:50,359
Irving heap?

361
00:16:50,425 --> 00:16:54,258
I'm detective Wagenbach.
This is detective Billings.

362
00:16:54,325 --> 00:16:56,325
We hear you're new
to the neighborhood.

363
00:16:56,392 --> 00:16:58,258
I re-registered
two weeks ago.

364
00:16:58,325 --> 00:17:00,092
Yeah, well, consider us
the welcome wagon.

365
00:17:00,158 --> 00:17:01,858
My family lives
right down the street.

366
00:17:01,925 --> 00:17:03,525
I notice you're not cops
in this district.

367
00:17:03,592 --> 00:17:05,225
I know my rights.

368
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:08,858
I'm not going anywhere near
your family or anyone else's.

369
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:10,625
That what you want to hear?

370
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,792
Steve...

371
00:17:15,858 --> 00:17:19,058
I am sick, detective.
That won't ever change.

372
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,925
And I raped that girl in
sacramento, but I did my stint.

373
00:17:22,991 --> 00:17:25,425
I haven't touched jailbait
since,

374
00:17:25,492 --> 00:17:27,225
so I have just as much right
to live on this street

375
00:17:27,292 --> 00:17:29,925
as anyone else.

376
00:17:35,258 --> 00:17:38,459
Hi. Hear you responded
to the police alert.

377
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:39,692
Shawn hoover.

378
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,925
I didn't see your bulletin
until after he left.

379
00:17:41,991 --> 00:17:44,092
It was less
than a half-hour ago, though.

380
00:17:44,158 --> 00:17:46,292
Is that him?

381
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:48,925
He had a young boy
with him... quite ill.

382
00:17:48,991 --> 00:17:50,492
Did you happen to see

383
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,991
what kind of car he was
driving when he left? Mnh-mnh.

384
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:55,991
Did he buy anything else?

385
00:17:56,058 --> 00:17:58,625
Yeah,
there was one other thing.

386
00:17:58,692 --> 00:18:01,258
Hi.

387
00:18:01,325 --> 00:18:03,759
Uh, gave Jackson
his medicine.

388
00:18:03,826 --> 00:18:06,726
The pharmacist says
if it's gonna work,

389
00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:10,359
it's gonna work fast,
but we got to watch him now.

390
00:18:10,425 --> 00:18:14,726
And, uh, we got you this.

391
00:18:19,726 --> 00:18:21,192
Thanks, baby.

392
00:18:21,258 --> 00:18:23,525
Yeah.

393
00:18:23,592 --> 00:18:26,559
What are those for?

394
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,359
Um... I had an idea.

395
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:31,192
The market's so bad
right now,

396
00:18:31,258 --> 00:18:34,025
there's all these houses
that are sitting empty.

397
00:18:34,092 --> 00:18:37,225
Some of them are sitting
six, eight months at a time.

398
00:18:37,292 --> 00:18:38,726
It's too dangerous
to squat.

399
00:18:38,792 --> 00:18:41,025
Yeah, but some of these houses
aren't even being shown.

400
00:18:41,092 --> 00:18:42,592
I mean, the owners
are just waiting

401
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:43,826
for the market to rebound.

402
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:46,792
Mara, we're better off
just staying still.

403
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:49,225
Yeah, well, Jackson's not.

404
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:51,492
I mean, this place
isn't good for him...

405
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:53,092
the dust in here,
the air.

406
00:18:53,158 --> 00:18:54,792
Plus, baby,
if he keeps crying,

407
00:18:54,858 --> 00:18:56,525
more people are gonna
come checking.

408
00:19:01,459 --> 00:19:02,891
I just missed him.

409
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:06,392
Put Shane's alias out to
all the local emergency rooms.

410
00:19:06,459 --> 00:19:07,659
Why all the E.r. S?

411
00:19:07,726 --> 00:19:09,359
Jackson might be sicker
than we thought.

412
00:19:09,425 --> 00:19:11,958
That's why
Shane's still in town.

413
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,759
I'll go wide...
60-mile radius.

414
00:19:13,826 --> 00:19:15,325
I'm gonna check on motels

415
00:19:15,392 --> 00:19:17,292
and start in the area
of this pharmacy

416
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,392
and work my way out.

417
00:19:18,459 --> 00:19:19,826
Shane's not stupid enough

418
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:22,125
to go to a pharmacy
near where he's staying.

419
00:19:22,192 --> 00:19:23,792
No, but maybe
Shawn hoover is.

420
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:26,292
If you do find them,
it's decision time, Vic.

421
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:27,659
What about Mara?

422
00:19:27,726 --> 00:19:29,492
She's not an innocent.

423
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,325
Mara knows
everything Shane does.

424
00:19:31,392 --> 00:19:34,425
She always has.
That's the way he wanted it.

425
00:19:34,492 --> 00:19:37,258
He came after us,
and she helped him.

426
00:19:37,325 --> 00:19:39,958
Now, if we take out Shane
and leave her,

427
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:41,625
she's gonna get caught,

428
00:19:41,692 --> 00:19:45,392
and she's gonna start pointing
all kinds of fingers at us.

429
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:46,826
Jesus Christ.

430
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:48,659
What about Jackson?

431
00:19:48,726 --> 00:19:52,325
Jackson's too young
to be a witness.

432
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:58,009
Latest research indicates
voters want their populism

433
00:19:58,575 --> 00:19:59,875
in small doses

434
00:19:59,942 --> 00:20:03,475
with competence and authority
as the main attraction.

435
00:20:04,775 --> 00:20:06,508
I thought your campaign
headquarters

436
00:20:06,575 --> 00:20:07,775
should reflect that.

437
00:20:07,842 --> 00:20:11,341
Quiero presentarte mi amigo,
guillermo Diaz.

438
00:20:11,408 --> 00:20:13,042
Mucho gusto.

439
00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:16,341
I met with miguel calderon
today.

440
00:20:16,408 --> 00:20:20,042
He's very interested
in coming on board

441
00:20:20,109 --> 00:20:22,775
as your campaign
finance Chief.

442
00:20:22,842 --> 00:20:25,241
I know miguel.
He's a good guy.

443
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:28,575
But, uh, I'm inclined to head
in a different direction.

444
00:20:28,642 --> 00:20:30,542
Calderon starts
on Monday.

445
00:20:30,608 --> 00:20:32,775
Cruz, that's not
your decision.

446
00:20:32,842 --> 00:20:35,475
And this is a conversation
we should be having in private.

447
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:39,208
You need to be very clear
on one thing.

448
00:20:39,275 --> 00:20:42,842
This place,
your campaign war chest,

449
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,875
media buys,
high-dollar strategists...

450
00:20:45,942 --> 00:20:47,842
everything that ensures

451
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:49,542
that you will be
the next mayor of Los Angeles,

452
00:20:49,608 --> 00:20:52,975
comes with a price.

453
00:20:53,042 --> 00:20:56,076
And I am very grateful
for your support,

454
00:20:56,142 --> 00:20:58,375
<i>but this is still
my campaign.</i>

455
00:20:58,442 --> 00:21:00,642
Mr. Mayor...

456
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:03,442
the dick is up your ass,

457
00:21:03,508 --> 00:21:06,842
and I am the one, not you,

458
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:10,076
who decides when and if
it comes out.

459
00:21:12,275 --> 00:21:13,642
¿entiendes?

460
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:19,775
It was all I could do to keep
from breaking this prick's jaw.

461
00:21:19,842 --> 00:21:21,176
You did great.

462
00:21:21,241 --> 00:21:23,275
The whole point here
is to get Pezuela believing

463
00:21:23,341 --> 00:21:24,542
he's calling the shots.

464
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,208
Lull him
into false complacency,

465
00:21:26,275 --> 00:21:28,475
he'll get overconfident,
start making mistakes.

466
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:29,709
Lets us take him down.

467
00:21:29,775 --> 00:21:31,909
Well, this better happen
sooner than later.

468
00:21:31,975 --> 00:21:34,176
I have an election,
and I'm not gonna win it

469
00:21:34,241 --> 00:21:36,442
pretending to be
this asshole's water boy...

470
00:21:36,508 --> 00:21:38,909
especially in front
of his new business associate.

471
00:21:38,975 --> 00:21:40,109
Who's that?

472
00:21:40,176 --> 00:21:42,341
He introduced him
as guillermo Diaz.

473
00:21:42,408 --> 00:21:45,009
Pezuela's verbal beat down
was for this guy's benefit.

474
00:21:45,076 --> 00:21:47,508
And judging from
his obvious need to impress,

475
00:21:47,575 --> 00:21:50,842
I'm guessing your intel about
a cartel evaluator was dead-on.

476
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,842
Would you be able
to pick Diaz out

477
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:54,975
if we gave you
some intelligence files?

478
00:21:55,042 --> 00:21:57,042
Sure.

479
00:21:57,109 --> 00:22:00,109
Deena's tip was dead-on.
Shane and Mara were here.

480
00:22:00,176 --> 00:22:02,909
They traded down
for a green '91 ford taurus.

481
00:22:02,975 --> 00:22:04,842
Give dispatch
that plate number.

482
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:06,775
You gonna let Ronnie know? No.

483
00:22:06,842 --> 00:22:08,608
Don't you think
he should know?

484
00:22:08,675 --> 00:22:11,642
Look, the whole city's working
overtime to find Vendrell.

485
00:22:11,709 --> 00:22:13,809
Updating Gardocki
is not my first priority.

486
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:27,542
Hey, I sure hope
you can help me out.

487
00:22:27,608 --> 00:22:29,608
Have you seen this guy
by any chance?

488
00:22:29,675 --> 00:22:31,508
He's a friend.
Sorry.

489
00:22:31,575 --> 00:22:35,042
He's traveling with his wife
and a sick child.

490
00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:38,076
Shawn hoover.

491
00:22:38,142 --> 00:22:40,475
Iook, I picked this up
for him.

492
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:42,508
His kid really needs it.

493
00:22:45,442 --> 00:22:47,942
Been getting a lot of complaints
about that brat crying.

494
00:22:50,076 --> 00:22:51,109
What room?

495
00:23:34,542 --> 00:23:37,042
<i>Dr. Willen, 2451.</i>

496
00:23:37,109 --> 00:23:39,642
<i>Dr. Willen, 2451.</i>

497
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:45,709
These people look fine.

498
00:23:45,775 --> 00:23:48,176
Jackson's really sick.
He needs to see a doctor.

499
00:23:48,241 --> 00:23:49,875
What do you want me to do,
Mara?

500
00:23:49,942 --> 00:23:52,442
I think he's having a bad
reaction to the medication.

501
00:23:52,508 --> 00:23:53,742
I understand.

502
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:56,308
Well, can you get
your sick son in

503
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:58,675
to see a doctor now,
please?

504
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:04,942
Excuse me.

505
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:07,275
He wasn't there.
I missed him again.

506
00:24:07,341 --> 00:24:10,042
Call just came in.
City of angels hospital.

507
00:24:10,109 --> 00:24:12,675
Nurse at the desk
flagged Shawn hoover.

508
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:15,709
He brought his son, Brian, in
with a high fever.

509
00:24:15,775 --> 00:24:16,742
I'm on my way.

510
00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:18,142
Something else...

511
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,608
Julien and Tina tracked down
Mara's Lexus through Deena.

512
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:22,208
Where?
Chop shop in sunland.

513
00:24:22,275 --> 00:24:24,308
He traded it
for a 1991 green ford taurus

514
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,241
with clean plates
and registration.

515
00:24:26,308 --> 00:24:28,241
Claudette and company
have that info?

516
00:24:28,308 --> 00:24:29,809
About five minutes
before me.

517
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:32,042
Got it.

518
00:24:36,076 --> 00:24:38,508
Margaret saw irving heap
just now.

519
00:24:38,575 --> 00:24:40,575
He kept staring at her,
angry,

520
00:24:40,642 --> 00:24:42,642
passed the house
a few times.

521
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:45,475
It scared her, Steve.
What the hell did you do?

522
00:24:45,542 --> 00:24:48,575
I just went by his house
to put the fear of God in him.

523
00:24:48,642 --> 00:24:49,742
Everything is fine.

524
00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:50,942
How's it fine?

525
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:53,408
The man's still living
on our street.

526
00:24:53,475 --> 00:24:54,709
I came to you for help,

527
00:24:54,775 --> 00:24:57,076
and whatever you said to him
made things worse.

528
00:24:57,142 --> 00:24:59,241
Iook, these types...
they operate in the shadows.

529
00:24:59,308 --> 00:25:00,909
All I'm trying to do
is draw him out.

530
00:25:00,975 --> 00:25:03,241
Now he sees my kids
as a threat.

531
00:25:03,308 --> 00:25:05,842
Nothing's going to happen
to our kids.

532
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:07,675
Heap knows I'm a cop.

533
00:25:07,742 --> 00:25:09,608
I thought you might be able
to help.

534
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:16,341
Hey.

535
00:25:16,408 --> 00:25:18,308
Hey.

536
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:19,809
You lied to me.

537
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:21,775
You goddamn bastard.

538
00:25:21,842 --> 00:25:22,909
Rita, wh-what...

539
00:25:22,975 --> 00:25:25,809
Iloyd told me everything
last night.

540
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:27,109
About what?

541
00:25:27,176 --> 00:25:31,109
You think that he shot that kid
deliberately?

542
00:25:31,176 --> 00:25:33,842
You think he actually planned
to kill him?

543
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:34,942
Is that true?

544
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:39,909
I actually felt...

545
00:25:39,975 --> 00:25:41,575
I'm so stupid.

546
00:25:41,642 --> 00:25:43,909
I looked into something
you said.

547
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:47,176
That teacher in tulsa
that pushed Lloyd around...

548
00:25:47,241 --> 00:25:49,475
he wanted to file
criminal charges against Lloyd.

549
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:52,408
Apparently, one night when you
were out, Lloyd tied up his son

550
00:25:52,475 --> 00:25:55,875
and threatened to torture and kill him.
That was a game. That was a stupid game.

551
00:25:55,942 --> 00:25:57,208
He was never gonna do that.

552
00:25:57,275 --> 00:26:01,642
No, it was him acting out
on his murder fascination.

553
00:26:01,709 --> 00:26:04,909
You made me think
we were on a date,

554
00:26:04,975 --> 00:26:07,709
and all you were doing was
gathering evidence on my son.

555
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:10,308
Rita...
I ought to slap you.

556
00:26:12,408 --> 00:26:14,076
If I were brave enough,

557
00:26:14,142 --> 00:26:16,442
I would slap the shit
out of you.

558
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:18,775
Just don't come near us.

559
00:26:18,842 --> 00:26:20,176
You got that?

560
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:26,875
You found
Pezuela's compadre?

561
00:26:26,942 --> 00:26:29,975
Yeah, I did.

562
00:26:30,042 --> 00:26:33,142
His name isn't Diaz.

563
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:35,241
It's guillermo beltran.

564
00:26:37,408 --> 00:26:38,975
You're certain
that's the man you saw?

565
00:26:39,042 --> 00:26:40,809
Yeah, 100%. Why?

566
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:43,241
You want to keep me
embedded in this jackpot,

567
00:26:43,308 --> 00:26:45,608
I'm entitled to know
who I'm rubbing elbows with.

568
00:26:45,675 --> 00:26:46,875
Guillermo beltran,

569
00:26:46,942 --> 00:26:49,442
former secretariat
of the presidential guard.

570
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:51,275
Resigned ahead
of a corruption shake-up

571
00:26:51,341 --> 00:26:53,375
during the vicente fox
administration.

572
00:26:53,442 --> 00:26:54,909
Used his grimy affiliation

573
00:26:54,975 --> 00:26:57,341
to kiss himself
into the guerrero drug cartel

574
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,642
as head of security.

575
00:26:58,709 --> 00:27:01,608
You know, I knew
Pezuela was hooked up, but...

576
00:27:01,675 --> 00:27:03,176
this guy's worldwide.

577
00:27:03,241 --> 00:27:05,542
He's been on the d.o.d.'s
watch list three years running.

578
00:27:05,608 --> 00:27:07,408
No wonder Pezuela was trying
to impress him.

579
00:27:07,475 --> 00:27:09,508
His boss is in town.

580
00:27:09,575 --> 00:27:11,909
Power player of this caliber
elevates Pezuela

581
00:27:11,975 --> 00:27:14,009
way beyond byz lat game level. No shit.

582
00:27:14,076 --> 00:27:16,508
And him taking stock
of local operations tells me

583
00:27:16,575 --> 00:27:19,275
the guerrero cartel wants
a seat at the table

584
00:27:19,341 --> 00:27:21,642
running the second biggest city
in America.

585
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:24,109
I need to get Washington
in the loop.

586
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:27,809
You know, from now on,
your bosses need to stop

587
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:30,076
treating my mayoral campaign

588
00:27:30,142 --> 00:27:34,009
as some loss leader
for an I.c.E. Investigation.

589
00:27:34,076 --> 00:27:35,909
That's never been
the case.

590
00:27:35,975 --> 00:27:37,475
Oh, we both know
that it is.

591
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:39,842
And it stops right now.

592
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:41,742
You heard Vic turned in
his badge yesterday?

593
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:43,642
I thought
he had another week.

594
00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:45,575
So, the way that I see it...
that leaves me

595
00:27:45,642 --> 00:27:48,408
to be your most important
instrument

596
00:27:48,475 --> 00:27:50,642
in the guerrero cartel
investigation.

597
00:27:50,709 --> 00:27:52,709
And you still have
our appreciation.

598
00:27:52,775 --> 00:27:54,542
But what I want is credit

599
00:27:54,608 --> 00:27:57,508
for a high-profile
international takedown,

600
00:27:57,575 --> 00:28:00,208
'cause
if I don't get mine...

601
00:28:00,275 --> 00:28:03,508
then I've never seen
this guy.

602
00:28:03,575 --> 00:28:06,542
I need to take care
of this irving heap situation.

603
00:28:06,608 --> 00:28:07,909
Heap hasn't come
anywhere near

604
00:28:07,975 --> 00:28:09,308
violating the terms
of his parole.

605
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:11,608
I know we're not gonna
get this guy

606
00:28:11,675 --> 00:28:13,742
acting officially as cops.

607
00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:15,809
You're my partner, right?

608
00:28:17,042 --> 00:28:19,375
What, I'm supposed to be
Shane Vendrell

609
00:28:19,442 --> 00:28:22,176
to whatever Vic Mackey plan
you've hatched?

610
00:28:22,275 --> 00:28:25,942
Look how it worked out for them.
No, thanks.

611
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:29,076
How's everything going
between you and Rita?

612
00:28:29,142 --> 00:28:30,942
She looked pretty pissed.

613
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,009
Her son
committed a murder.

614
00:28:33,076 --> 00:28:35,542
She's starting
to realize that fact.

615
00:28:35,608 --> 00:28:37,275
You know,
I'm not exactly sure

616
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:39,642
what lover Dutch game
you're playing there,

617
00:28:39,709 --> 00:28:42,142
but I know that none of it's
been above boards.

618
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:44,975
Now, I was with you every step
of the way on that case.

619
00:28:45,042 --> 00:28:48,909
I listened to your theories.
I got you alone with the kid.

620
00:28:48,975 --> 00:28:51,176
Now it's your turn
to step up.

621
00:28:51,241 --> 00:28:53,842
I can't be a party
to anything that's unethical.

622
00:28:56,042 --> 00:28:58,109
I'm sorry.

623
00:29:07,176 --> 00:29:10,341
I've given him a shot
of a stronger antibiotic.

624
00:29:10,408 --> 00:29:13,375
It's gonna help
with his cough and the fever?

625
00:29:13,442 --> 00:29:14,875
Eventually.

626
00:29:14,942 --> 00:29:18,208
My immediate concern is
getting the temperature down.

627
00:29:18,275 --> 00:29:19,608
I want to keep him here
overnight

628
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:20,809
so I can keep an eye on him.

629
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:22,508
Well, is that
really necessary?

630
00:29:22,575 --> 00:29:24,241
I mean,
we can do that, right?

631
00:29:24,308 --> 00:29:25,508
I'd rather have him here.

632
00:29:25,575 --> 00:29:27,975
Iook, doc, it's just that
I'm starting a new job

633
00:29:28,042 --> 00:29:29,608
in a couple of days
up north.

634
00:29:29,675 --> 00:29:31,176
If I'm not there,
it's gone.

635
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:32,942
Your son
shouldn't be traveling.

636
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:34,975
Trust me...
we don't want that, either.

637
00:29:35,042 --> 00:29:36,208
Iook, it's just that

638
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,208
I've been out of work
for a little while.

639
00:29:38,275 --> 00:29:39,742
And we don't
have insurance.

640
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:41,275
We'll watch him
every minute.

641
00:29:41,341 --> 00:29:43,942
If anything goes wrong,
if his fever doesn't come down,

642
00:29:44,009 --> 00:29:45,842
we'll stop at a hospital
on the way.

643
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:49,842
I have some samples of the
antibiotic to tide you over.

644
00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:51,241
I'll meet you
at the nurse's station

645
00:29:51,308 --> 00:29:53,009
and tell you
how they should be administered.

646
00:29:53,076 --> 00:29:54,275
Okay.
Thank you.

647
00:30:14,809 --> 00:30:17,275
Jesus Christ.

648
00:30:20,442 --> 00:30:24,075
Detective Keefe,
I got your call.

649
00:30:24,142 --> 00:30:26,175
Steve Billings.

650
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:28,908
Iooks like you caught
the bastard on something.

651
00:30:28,975 --> 00:30:31,175
Found child pornography
in his bedroom.

652
00:30:31,242 --> 00:30:33,876
Second offense, so this guy's
going back to prison.

653
00:30:33,941 --> 00:30:35,208
Detective Wagenbach.

654
00:30:35,275 --> 00:30:37,475
I'm curious...
how'd you get the warrant?

655
00:30:37,542 --> 00:30:39,041
Anonymous tip.

656
00:30:39,108 --> 00:30:41,175
Really?
Where from?

657
00:30:41,242 --> 00:30:44,208
Don't know.
It was anonymous.

658
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,742
Once in a while,
you get lucky.

659
00:30:47,975 --> 00:30:49,509
I appreciate the call.

660
00:30:49,575 --> 00:30:52,509
If you ever need anything,
you know where to find me.

661
00:30:56,108 --> 00:30:57,242
Shawn?

662
00:30:57,308 --> 00:30:59,142
Shawn,
got to go.

663
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:00,475
I'll be right there.

664
00:31:00,542 --> 00:31:02,008
Let's leave it. Let's go. What?

665
00:31:02,075 --> 00:31:04,075
I heard two nurses talking.
They said somebody got shot.

666
00:31:04,142 --> 00:31:06,075
There's an ambulance,
and the police are on the way.

667
00:31:06,142 --> 00:31:09,342
Come on,
come on, come on.

668
00:31:15,175 --> 00:31:17,709
It's okay.
It's okay, Jackson.

669
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:19,908
Shh. It's okay.

670
00:31:36,475 --> 00:31:38,675
Officer!

671
00:31:38,742 --> 00:31:41,175
Officer, that man over there
has a gun!

672
00:31:41,242 --> 00:31:43,575
Hey, you!

673
00:31:43,642 --> 00:31:46,375
Hey!
Stop right there.

674
00:31:46,442 --> 00:31:48,275
There's no problem here, guys.

675
00:31:48,342 --> 00:31:50,075
Stop walking now!

676
00:31:53,108 --> 00:31:55,041
Keep your hands
where we can see them.

677
00:31:57,242 --> 00:31:58,475
Are you carrying
a weapon?

678
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:02,175
.357 eagle... crossdraw.

679
00:32:02,242 --> 00:32:04,308
Get on the ground.

680
00:32:05,975 --> 00:32:08,908
I said,
"get on the ground"!

681
00:32:08,975 --> 00:32:11,375
Now!

682
00:32:16,742 --> 00:32:17,941
The whole neighborhood's

683
00:32:18,008 --> 00:32:19,709
talking about
irving heap's arrest.

684
00:32:19,776 --> 00:32:21,509
Area police were already
on the job.

685
00:32:21,575 --> 00:32:23,876
I just gave them
an insider's nudge.

686
00:32:23,941 --> 00:32:25,275
Thanks, dad.

687
00:32:25,342 --> 00:32:27,876
I'll take you to that movie
this weekend, okay?

688
00:32:27,941 --> 00:32:29,442
Okay.

689
00:32:29,509 --> 00:32:31,776
I love you.

690
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:38,876
You feel good
about yourself?

691
00:32:38,941 --> 00:32:40,108
Actually, I do.

692
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:41,941
I'm gonna sleep a hell
of a lot better tonight

693
00:32:42,008 --> 00:32:43,409
knowing
my daughters are safe.

694
00:32:43,475 --> 00:32:46,742
You committed a crime.

695
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:49,575
What crime is that?

696
00:32:52,776 --> 00:32:55,041
Did heap really have
that child porn,

697
00:32:55,108 --> 00:32:58,642
or did they plant it along with
their bogus warrant? You were there.

698
00:32:58,709 --> 00:33:00,075
I didn't ask,

699
00:33:00,142 --> 00:33:02,542
and detective Keefe did me
the courtesy of not telling.

700
00:33:02,609 --> 00:33:04,275
He's been clean
for six years, Steve.

701
00:33:04,342 --> 00:33:06,242
No, he wasn't clean.
He just hadn't been caught.

702
00:33:06,308 --> 00:33:08,609
And for all we know,
he was gonna stay clean.

703
00:33:08,675 --> 00:33:10,642
They found kiddy porn in the
guy's bedroom, for Christ's sake.

704
00:33:10,709 --> 00:33:12,375
Come on,
he's spot-checked twice a month.

705
00:33:12,442 --> 00:33:15,575
Today he just happened to leave
kiddy porn on his dresser?

706
00:33:15,642 --> 00:33:17,008
Please.

707
00:33:17,075 --> 00:33:20,675
A cop helped another cop out.
It's called loyalty.

708
00:33:20,742 --> 00:33:22,175
It's wrong.

709
00:33:24,575 --> 00:33:27,375
Yeah, well, if it's so wrong,
why don't you turn me

710
00:33:27,442 --> 00:33:29,709
and half the north Hollywood
division in?

711
00:33:32,442 --> 00:33:35,142
Vic Mackey was detained
by two police officers

712
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:37,609
in a hospital
in east Hollywood tonight.

713
00:33:37,675 --> 00:33:38,908
Why was he held?

714
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:42,175
A couple with a small child
told the officers

715
00:33:42,242 --> 00:33:44,709
that he had a gun
and pointed it at them.

716
00:33:44,776 --> 00:33:47,008
Well, that doesn't make any sense. No.

717
00:33:47,075 --> 00:33:50,208
So, they looked at the hospital
surveillance tape,

718
00:33:50,275 --> 00:33:54,442
and the couple
was Shane and Mara Vendrell.

719
00:33:56,175 --> 00:33:58,908
Tell me what you know about it,
and don't leave anything out.

720
00:33:58,975 --> 00:34:00,809
I've been chained to a desk,
remember?

721
00:34:00,876 --> 00:34:03,175
I don't know what Vic does
every minute of the day.

722
00:34:03,242 --> 00:34:05,509
Then tell me about the minutes
you do know about.

723
00:34:05,575 --> 00:34:07,575
Of course Vic wants
to bring Shane in,

724
00:34:07,642 --> 00:34:10,409
but I don't know
why they were at a hospital.

725
00:34:10,475 --> 00:34:11,742
I don't know
how Vic found them.

726
00:34:11,809 --> 00:34:13,642
Vic's gone.

727
00:34:13,709 --> 00:34:16,742
He left in disgrace.

728
00:34:16,809 --> 00:34:19,075
Now, you've got two roads
to choose from.

729
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:21,609
You can either look at this
as a fresh start,

730
00:34:21,675 --> 00:34:24,542
or you can throw your career
away just like he's done.

731
00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:26,275
What do you want to do,
detective?

732
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,242
I want my job.

733
00:34:30,308 --> 00:34:32,375
Then start fighting
for it.

734
00:34:32,442 --> 00:34:36,409
I'm gonna ask you one more time
about last night.

735
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:40,776
Why does Vendrell
want you dead?

736
00:34:50,075 --> 00:34:52,709
Vic and I found out
that Shane killed Lem.

737
00:34:55,175 --> 00:34:56,308
Go on.

738
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:58,575
We'd been suspecting him
for a few weeks.

739
00:34:58,642 --> 00:34:59,876
After all this time,

740
00:34:59,941 --> 00:35:01,742
trying to find the asshole
that killed our friend,

741
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:03,242
things started pointing
at Shane.

742
00:35:03,308 --> 00:35:05,308
Just things?
The grenade.

743
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:08,342
We made a bust on the
Salvadorans, confiscated some.

744
00:35:08,409 --> 00:35:09,876
We think
Shane held one back.

745
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,809
What reason would Shane have
to kill Lem?

746
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:12,975
I don't know.

747
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:14,575
The only thing
that we could figure out

748
00:35:14,642 --> 00:35:16,642
was Shane's involvement
with the armenians.

749
00:35:16,709 --> 00:35:19,575
Shane was double dipping.
Lem found out about it.

750
00:35:19,642 --> 00:35:21,542
When Rezian's whole crew
wound up dead,

751
00:35:21,609 --> 00:35:23,709
that theory started
looking a lot better.

752
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,342
Do you have proof
for any of this,

753
00:35:25,409 --> 00:35:27,175
or is this all based
on assumptions?

754
00:35:27,242 --> 00:35:29,709
Kavanaugh's final report...
the night Lem was killed.

755
00:35:29,776 --> 00:35:31,941
Shane told us he had been
followed all night long

756
00:35:32,008 --> 00:35:33,242
just like we had.

757
00:35:33,308 --> 00:35:35,142
Only Kavanaugh wrote
only Vic and I were followed.

758
00:35:35,208 --> 00:35:36,542
Shane lied to us.

759
00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:39,709
And why am I just
finding out about this now?

760
00:35:39,776 --> 00:35:42,208
Captain, Shane was our friend.

761
00:35:42,275 --> 00:35:44,409
We didn't want
to come to you

762
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:47,409
until we knew
we had all the proof,

763
00:35:47,475 --> 00:35:49,108
and Shane must have
found out about it

764
00:35:49,175 --> 00:35:50,342
and tried
to have us killed.

765
00:35:50,409 --> 00:35:52,342
"Us"?

766
00:35:52,409 --> 00:35:54,475
Vic thinks that Shane
was waiting at his place

767
00:35:54,542 --> 00:35:55,842
personally last night.

768
00:35:55,908 --> 00:35:58,242
If I hadn't have called him
when my hit went sideways,

769
00:35:58,308 --> 00:35:59,675
Vic could be dead
right now.

770
00:35:59,742 --> 00:36:02,475
So, Vic went to the hospital
for revenge?

771
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:04,175
No, a bullet is too good.

772
00:36:04,242 --> 00:36:05,776
Vic wants Shane caught.

773
00:36:05,842 --> 00:36:07,609
He wants him to serve time

774
00:36:07,675 --> 00:36:10,242
with all the other shitbags
that we put in there.

775
00:36:10,308 --> 00:36:12,941
We're all on the same side
on this, captain.

776
00:36:22,009 --> 00:36:24,009
Returning my calls
in person?

777
00:36:24,075 --> 00:36:27,408
Uh, better late than never.
I've got a lot on my plate.

778
00:36:27,475 --> 00:36:31,341
Really? 'cause I hear
you're already unemployed.

779
00:36:31,408 --> 00:36:34,209
I didn't want to tell you
over the phone.

780
00:36:36,508 --> 00:36:37,842
Quite the asshole.

781
00:36:37,909 --> 00:36:41,508
This is the guy I.c.E. Has been
interested in all along.

782
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:44,209
Aceveda's the one
who put us onto him.

783
00:36:44,276 --> 00:36:46,308
Then prepare to get bitten
in the ass.

784
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:48,075
The lies start with Aceveda
looking at himself

785
00:36:48,142 --> 00:36:49,375
in the mirror every morning.

786
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:51,308
David's an open book.

787
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,441
He has agreed to keep us advised
on beltran's involvement.

788
00:36:54,508 --> 00:36:56,408
Well, I'll pick up
where he leaves,

789
00:36:56,475 --> 00:36:59,575
get a handle
on beltran's street activities.

790
00:36:59,642 --> 00:37:02,075
But we're gonna have to
formalize

791
00:37:02,142 --> 00:37:04,308
our business relationship
on the long term.

792
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:08,775
Vic, you're not a cop anymore.
You're just a C.I. Now.

793
00:37:08,842 --> 00:37:11,542
Then I'm not freelancing
for you people in a war zone.

794
00:37:11,608 --> 00:37:14,408
I need I.c.E. Credentials,
a paycheck, and full dental.

795
00:37:14,475 --> 00:37:17,308
That was an easier sell
before you turned your badge in.

796
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:19,242
If you're no longer valuable
to Pezuela,

797
00:37:19,308 --> 00:37:20,742
we're not sure
you're valuable

798
00:37:20,809 --> 00:37:22,875
to this investigation
moving forward.

799
00:37:22,942 --> 00:37:24,942
Who says I'm no longer valuable
to Pezuela?

800
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,276
I'm still on his payroll.

801
00:37:26,341 --> 00:37:28,475
I still have
all the cop connections I need.

802
00:37:28,542 --> 00:37:30,508
If anything,
being badgeless just means

803
00:37:30,575 --> 00:37:32,575
I have more time
to devote to his cause.

804
00:37:32,642 --> 00:37:34,176
We're not sure
we see it that way.

805
00:37:36,341 --> 00:37:39,542
I've been keeping you
out of jail and in a job.

806
00:37:39,608 --> 00:37:41,809
When that box shows up
with your file in it,

807
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:43,708
you'll see
how goddamn valuable I am.

808
00:37:45,542 --> 00:37:48,042
Listen,
just give me some time

809
00:37:48,109 --> 00:37:51,109
to get cozied up
to this beltran guy.

810
00:37:51,176 --> 00:37:54,542
You'll see I'm still the man
on the inside.

811
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:56,475
I helped you
out of your jam.

812
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:58,308
You can help me
out of mine.

813
00:37:58,375 --> 00:38:01,276
Rita.

814
00:38:01,341 --> 00:38:04,809
Why are you so convinced
Lloyd's a murderer?

815
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:07,975
Come in.

816
00:38:11,842 --> 00:38:15,675
I went home last night
after seeing you,

817
00:38:15,742 --> 00:38:19,075
and he and I
got into an argument.

818
00:38:19,142 --> 00:38:21,276
About what?

819
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:22,875
You.

820
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:27,375
I told him that we kissed

821
00:38:27,441 --> 00:38:31,042
and that I was hoping
that we could start dating.

822
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:33,075
I thought he'd be happy,

823
00:38:33,142 --> 00:38:37,075
because you'd been so good
to us.

824
00:38:37,142 --> 00:38:41,176
And he called me pathetic.

825
00:38:41,242 --> 00:38:43,075
Then he started laughing
at me,

826
00:38:43,142 --> 00:38:46,508
because I'd thought
that you were interested.

827
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:49,508
Then he said
that you ruined me for him.

828
00:38:49,575 --> 00:38:51,109
What does that mean?

829
00:38:51,176 --> 00:38:53,508
You need to get away
from him.

830
00:38:53,575 --> 00:38:57,075
He's not an abusive husband
or a cheating boyfriend.

831
00:38:57,142 --> 00:38:58,608
He's my son.

832
00:38:58,675 --> 00:39:01,642
I cook dinner for him.
I drive him to school.

833
00:39:01,708 --> 00:39:04,775
I wash his clothes.
I can't walk away from him.

834
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:09,708
Bring him into the Barn.
Help me convince him to confess.

835
00:39:09,775 --> 00:39:11,909
And what if he doesn't...
if he's innocent?

836
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:13,642
He's not.

837
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:15,742
You can't prove that.

838
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:17,142
We both know it.

839
00:39:17,209 --> 00:39:18,276
He's my boy!

840
00:39:18,341 --> 00:39:21,242
Every killer this world
has ever seen

841
00:39:21,308 --> 00:39:23,209
started out
as somebody's boy.

842
00:39:24,608 --> 00:39:27,341
Iloyd is gonna kill
somebody else eventually...

843
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:29,642
someone else's son
or daughter...

844
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:32,176
unless you help me stop him.
I don't believe that.

845
00:39:32,242 --> 00:39:33,341
I don't believe that!

846
00:39:33,408 --> 00:39:34,909
No.

847
00:39:42,375 --> 00:39:44,575
What if Shane saw you
coming here?

848
00:39:44,642 --> 00:39:46,142
He didn't.
I made sure.

849
00:39:46,209 --> 00:39:48,375
Don't worry about it.

850
00:39:50,341 --> 00:39:52,142
Hey, cass.

851
00:39:52,209 --> 00:39:54,608
Dad.

852
00:39:54,675 --> 00:39:56,542
What are you doing here
so late?

853
00:39:56,608 --> 00:39:59,209
Oh, your mother and I
have an important phone call.

854
00:39:59,276 --> 00:40:01,875
Listen, kid, you should
get ready for bed, okay?

855
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:03,608
I didn't do anything
this time.

856
00:40:03,675 --> 00:40:05,142
No one said you did.

857
00:40:05,209 --> 00:40:07,176
Is that phone call
about me?

858
00:40:07,242 --> 00:40:10,308
No, cass.
No, no, it's not about you.

859
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:11,608
I am glad
that I caught you

860
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:13,009
before you went to sleep,
though.

861
00:40:13,075 --> 00:40:15,308
Go on, get ready.

862
00:40:22,942 --> 00:40:24,042
Night.

863
00:40:24,109 --> 00:40:25,809
Night.

864
00:40:30,408 --> 00:40:33,009
Shane said
he didn't want you here.

865
00:40:35,242 --> 00:40:36,909
Well, then,
let's not tell him.

866
00:40:58,642 --> 00:40:59,742
Hello?

867
00:40:59,809 --> 00:41:01,276
What the hell's wrong
with you?

868
00:41:01,341 --> 00:41:02,642
<i>What the hell is wrong
with me?</i>

869
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:03,942
Is Vic there?

870
00:41:04,009 --> 00:41:06,242
You told him to stay away,
didn't you?

871
00:41:06,308 --> 00:41:07,508
I get why Vic lied.

872
00:41:07,575 --> 00:41:09,708
What I don't understand
is why you would.

873
00:41:09,775 --> 00:41:11,176
I didn't lie to you.

874
00:41:11,242 --> 00:41:14,009
All we're trying to do
is get away from him, Corrine.

875
00:41:14,075 --> 00:41:15,575
Don't you comprehend that?

876
00:41:15,642 --> 00:41:18,242
We don't want to see you,
and you don't want to see us,

877
00:41:18,308 --> 00:41:19,742
but that's not enough, is it?

878
00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:21,542
That'll never be enough
for Vic.

879
00:41:21,608 --> 00:41:24,675
We want the same things
that you do, Mara.

880
00:41:24,742 --> 00:41:28,176
Vic tried to kill us tonight,
and you helped him.

881
00:41:28,242 --> 00:41:31,475
He made you an accessory
to attempted murder,

882
00:41:31,542 --> 00:41:34,408
and now you're a criminal
just like Vic.

883
00:41:34,475 --> 00:41:35,608
What do you mean?

884
00:41:35,675 --> 00:41:37,308
He came after us
at the hospital tonight

885
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:39,909
while I was trying to get
Jackson treated for his fever.

886
00:41:39,975 --> 00:41:42,142
And if those cops didn't show up
when they did,

887
00:41:42,209 --> 00:41:46,075
he would have murdered my entire
family... my unborn child.

888
00:41:46,142 --> 00:41:47,508
I understand.

889
00:41:47,575 --> 00:41:49,875
I hope so, because that's
why Vic turned in his badge.

890
00:41:49,942 --> 00:41:51,975
He's just gonna keep
coming after us

891
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:53,708
until he gets what he wants,

892
00:41:53,775 --> 00:41:57,142
and the death of my children
will be on your head.

893
00:41:57,209 --> 00:41:59,508
When I call you tomorrow
at 1:00,

894
00:41:59,575 --> 00:42:02,242
you need to have detailed
and specific information

895
00:42:02,308 --> 00:42:04,809
on how and where
the police are looking for us.

896
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:06,341
You got that?
Yeah.

897
00:42:06,408 --> 00:42:09,075
I'm only asking you again 'cause
I don't have a choice, Corrine.

898
00:42:19,276 --> 00:42:21,075
What did she say?

899
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:28,475
She said that... that
they don't trust you anymore

900
00:42:28,542 --> 00:42:32,308
and that they're not going
to be calling back here...

901
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:34,608
ever.

902
00:42:42,242 --> 00:42:44,308
I think I scared her.

903
00:42:46,475 --> 00:42:49,408
I want you to do something
for me.

904
00:42:49,475 --> 00:42:51,109
Sure. What?

905
00:42:53,341 --> 00:42:56,809
You got me here,
and, uh...

906
00:42:56,875 --> 00:43:00,341
and I'll be safe
for a few days.

907
00:43:03,842 --> 00:43:04,975
I want you to go back,

908
00:43:05,042 --> 00:43:06,642
and I want you
to turn yourself in.

909
00:43:09,242 --> 00:43:10,942
No.

910
00:43:11,009 --> 00:43:12,809
L-I don't even want to think
about that now, just listen to me.

911
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:14,875
Because it's too late. Listen, listen,
listen to me. Listen to me, okay?

912
00:43:14,942 --> 00:43:16,441
They got nothing solid
on you.

913
00:43:16,508 --> 00:43:20,408
You just tell them that I
threatened you into helping me,

914
00:43:20,475 --> 00:43:24,575
and tell them that you were
scared for your life, okay?

915
00:43:24,642 --> 00:43:27,608
They'll believe that.

916
00:43:27,675 --> 00:43:29,775
I won't do it.

917
00:43:29,842 --> 00:43:32,775
Mara, you got to take care
of Jackson...

918
00:43:32,842 --> 00:43:35,009
yourself...

919
00:43:35,075 --> 00:43:37,675
our little baby girl
right in here.

920
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:41,975
No.

921
00:43:42,042 --> 00:43:44,708
Mara, you and... and the kids
can still have a good life,

922
00:43:44,775 --> 00:43:47,508
and that's... that is all
that matters to me.

923
00:43:47,575 --> 00:43:48,608
No, we wouldn't.

924
00:43:48,675 --> 00:43:50,742
We wouldn't have you.

925
00:43:50,809 --> 00:43:53,875
Listen, you can't ||think
about me now, okayyo||u can't.

926
00:43:53,942 --> 00:43:55,042
All right?

927
00:43:55,109 --> 00:43:57,708
Now, you got to go.

928
00:43:57,775 --> 00:43:58,909
OK

929
00:43:58,975 --> 00:44:00,842
you got to go.
Come on.

930
00:44:00,909 --> 00:44:02,142
Come on.

931
00:44:06,642 --> 00:44:07,975
Come on.

932
00:44:11,742 --> 00:44:14,675
We're a family.

933
00:44:14,742 --> 00:44:17,642
Nobody's gonna tear us apart.
Let's go inside.

934
00:44:25,675 --> 00:44:29,642
Well, I always told you
I'd get you a mansion someday.
