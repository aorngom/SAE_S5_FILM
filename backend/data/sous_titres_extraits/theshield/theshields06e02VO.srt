<i>Previously on</i> The Shield<i>...</i>

2
00:00:03,014 --> 00:00:05,247
He screwed my ex wife
with the sole purpose

3
00:00:05,398 --> 00:00:09,259
of making this investigation
seem like a personal vendetta.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,143
This guy's just pissing,
he's pissing all over us.

5
00:00:12,307 --> 00:00:14,594
I've made you coffee
and I've been patient,

6
00:00:14,812 --> 00:00:15,829
you need to go.

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,910
Okay. Stop, stop. Stop!

8
00:00:20,093 --> 00:00:21,093
I'm gonna take a deal.

9
00:00:21,252 --> 00:00:22,986
I report for processing
tomorrow morning.

10
00:00:23,141 --> 00:00:24,730
We gotta wait for you to get to mexico.

11
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:26,655
We got money parked
in an account for you.

12
00:00:26,838 --> 00:00:28,757
- It's all set up.
- I'm not going that route.

13
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,307
They're gonna make you give us up.

14
00:00:30,471 --> 00:00:33,539
Why'd you even come back here tonight
if you weren't planning on leaving?

15
00:00:36,226 --> 00:00:37,242
Shane?

16
00:00:42,732 --> 00:00:44,513
We're gonna find out
who did this.

17
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:46,728
And we're gonna kill him.

18
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:49,340
It's Guardo, he stepped on
his protection twice.

19
00:00:49,522 --> 00:00:51,500
Killing Lem was a message to stay away.

20
00:00:51,664 --> 00:00:54,281
You've murdered two of
your own team members.

21
00:00:55,751 --> 00:00:57,530
You're done with Mackey.
You're off of it.

22
00:00:57,694 --> 00:01:00,085
I have proof that Vic
had Lemansky killed.

23
00:01:00,412 --> 00:01:05,004
I say that Vic used me as a middle man
to set up the hit on his guy.

24
00:01:05,168 --> 00:01:07,392
I'm just trying to get you
to tell the truth.

25
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,452
It's just somebody else's
truth, that's all.

26
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:10,931
You get Emolia to lie for you.

27
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:13,980
You just stepped onto
an entirely new playing field.

28
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,868
I hope you know the rules of the game.

29
00:01:34,873 --> 00:01:36,916
Sorry.
Claudette had us running down a lead

30
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,503
on the San Marcos house slaughter.

31
00:01:38,653 --> 00:01:40,229
I thought that was robbery/homicide.

32
00:01:40,407 --> 00:01:42,498
They'd get their loafers
dirty knocking on doors.

33
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:43,661
Who's the bag of bones?

34
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:46,823
Jupo Nunez. Founding father
of the salvadoran gang.

35
00:01:47,004 --> 00:01:50,789
Granted parole yesterday
after 50 years of a life sentence.

36
00:01:50,962 --> 00:01:51,962
Why the early release?

37
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:53,141
He's terminal.

38
00:01:53,523 --> 00:01:54,557
Lung cancer.

39
00:02:02,903 --> 00:02:03,920
Hey.

40
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:07,450
You think you can hang on long enough
to answer a few questions?

41
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:09,736
- Do I know you?
- Vic Mackey.

42
00:02:09,926 --> 00:02:11,142
You're before my time.

43
00:02:11,524 --> 00:02:13,412
But your male nurse
probably heard of me.

44
00:02:14,356 --> 00:02:16,153
He's the Farmington cop, grandpa.

45
00:02:16,316 --> 00:02:17,848
Had the run-ins with Guardo.

46
00:02:18,332 --> 00:02:20,241
You're the one raging war against us.

47
00:02:20,426 --> 00:02:21,851
Come to tear down a dying man?

48
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:23,313
My beef's with Guardo.

49
00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:25,510
He calls the shots now.

50
00:02:25,782 --> 00:02:27,797
I built this gang from the ground up.

51
00:02:28,196 --> 00:02:30,901
Guardo, all of them, owe me everything.

52
00:02:31,064 --> 00:02:33,333
Leaving you here to live in paradise.

53
00:02:33,642 --> 00:02:35,294
After a lifetime of service.

54
00:02:35,802 --> 00:02:37,200
That's one hell of a pension plan.

55
00:02:38,562 --> 00:02:39,863
You came here to insult me?

56
00:02:40,024 --> 00:02:42,793
I came here to give you a chance
to salvage your life's work.

57
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,116
Now you give me Guardo.

58
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,688
I turn on one of my own,
I disgrace myself.

59
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,453
The salvadorans lost their honor

60
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,065
after Guardo killed a cop.

61
00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:53,628
You old school guys.

62
00:02:53,792 --> 00:02:55,071
You knew never to do that.

63
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,495
And in return, we showed
you a level of respect.

64
00:02:57,695 --> 00:03:00,145
Giving him up is a step towards
restoring the glory days.

65
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:01,994
I don't know he killed one of you.

66
00:03:02,155 --> 00:03:03,644
We do. Besides,

67
00:03:03,843 --> 00:03:06,385
maybe your new leader would have
a better sense of history.

68
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,073
How to treat their heroes.

69
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:09,833
The new generation.

70
00:03:10,143 --> 00:03:11,663
No respect for the rules.

71
00:03:11,844 --> 00:03:13,097
That's disgraceful.

72
00:03:14,204 --> 00:03:15,257
What's worse is...

73
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:17,182
Kids like your grandson here

74
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,596
are gonna have to pay the
price for that disrespect.

75
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:22,501
That gat he's hiding under his shirt,
that's a felony.

76
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,369
Who knows what else I might find
if I decide to be a hardass.

77
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,850
Guardo killed Danny Rosa.

78
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:38,090
All I have is a number.

79
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,902
It's where we call him
to give him a message.

80
00:03:49,822 --> 00:03:51,402
- Vic, it's Asher.
<i>- What's going on?</i>

81
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,582
I'm at your house.

82
00:03:52,745 --> 00:03:53,844
Serving a search warrant.

83
00:03:54,017 --> 00:03:55,695
- For what?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

84
00:03:55,864 --> 00:03:56,880
Well, who's there?

85
00:03:57,044 --> 00:03:58,968
Kavanaugh, Wagenbach, Captain Wyms.

86
00:03:59,131 --> 00:04:01,823
Is there anything you need me to do?
Anything to clean up?

87
00:04:02,004 --> 00:04:03,402
No. There's nothing to find.

88
00:04:03,929 --> 00:04:05,200
Thanks for the heads up though.

89
00:04:05,363 --> 00:04:06,937
Jesus christ, Kavanaugh's at my place.

90
00:04:07,088 --> 00:04:08,194
He's got a search warrant.

91
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:10,370
Based on the Emolia's bullshit story?

92
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,415
Hey, hey.
Is there something that I need to know?

93
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,290
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

94
00:04:16,398 --> 00:04:17,886
Is there anything there to find?

95
00:04:18,194 --> 00:04:20,137
- About Lem or anything else?
- No.

96
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,579
Nothing in Vic's closet.

97
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,412
- You?
- Just leftovers.

98
00:04:36,284 --> 00:04:37,409
Did you look in the trash?

99
00:04:37,936 --> 00:04:39,225
You see the brand new jacket?

100
00:04:39,443 --> 00:04:41,218
Garbage is what God made unis for.

101
00:04:42,093 --> 00:04:44,108
I thought you were gonna
take a personal day.

102
00:04:44,271 --> 00:04:45,288
It's thursday.

103
00:04:45,487 --> 00:04:47,938
I figured I take it tomorrow.
Get the three-days weekend.

104
00:04:49,063 --> 00:04:50,515
Check the bathroom, would you?

105
00:05:05,524 --> 00:05:06,558
Claudette!

106
00:05:07,866 --> 00:05:08,882
Claudette.

107
00:05:09,734 --> 00:05:11,585
- Yeah.
- Found this balled up in the trash.

108
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:13,718
The circle there is where
Portillo autobody is.

109
00:05:13,891 --> 00:05:15,425
- Where Lemansky was killed.
- Yeah.

110
00:05:15,588 --> 00:05:17,223
Mackey said he'd never been there.

111
00:05:17,641 --> 00:05:19,746
Just keep looking.
Cause if he's this sloppy...

112
00:05:20,182 --> 00:05:21,199
maybe there's more.

113
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:24,601
You've read the statement.

114
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,662
You swear it's entirely truthful,

115
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,443
everything about Detective Mackey?

116
00:05:30,275 --> 00:05:31,428
- Yes.
- OK.

117
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:32,626
Sign and date here.

118
00:05:43,446 --> 00:05:45,861
Finished the search of
Vic's house and found these.

119
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:48,364
This is a matchbook
from Tama's costora.

120
00:05:49,046 --> 00:05:50,262
Where Emolia's been working.

121
00:05:50,444 --> 00:05:52,096
Vic said he hadn't seen or spoken to her

122
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:53,772
since he cut her off as an informant.

123
00:05:53,925 --> 00:05:56,293
Of course, we don't know
when he picked up the matchbook.

124
00:05:56,446 --> 00:05:58,709
$500 cash tucked inside
his yellow pages.

125
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,924
Exact amount that Emolia said Vic

126
00:06:01,105 --> 00:06:02,558
offered to give Lem up to Guardo.

127
00:06:03,628 --> 00:06:05,607
Vic or any of the other
guys return our calls?

128
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:08,131
- Not yet.
- Was the cash loose in the phone book?

129
00:06:08,312 --> 00:06:09,456
No. It was in that envelope.

130
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,667
Send it to the crime lab.

131
00:06:10,818 --> 00:06:12,579
See if you can get
Vic's prints off of it.

132
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,684
Fine. But if you ask me,
this is all bullshit.

133
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:17,045
There's no way Vic offed
one of his own guys.

134
00:06:25,771 --> 00:06:27,202
Phone number tracks here.

135
00:06:27,376 --> 00:06:28,532
Nydia Hernandez.

136
00:06:28,683 --> 00:06:30,199
I knocked.
No one answered.

137
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:31,815
So what now?

138
00:06:32,706 --> 00:06:33,850
We're gonna go inside.

139
00:06:34,031 --> 00:06:35,102
Wait for Guardo.

140
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:36,664
Take him someplace private.

141
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:39,822
Find out how he got close to Lem.

142
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:42,600
Then we're gonna kill him.

143
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,069
And anybody else involved.

144
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:49,315
<i>All units stand by for crime broadcast.</i>

145
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:51,760
<i>Wanted for questioning,
Detective Vic Mackey.</i>

<i>Farmington Detectives.

147

<i>on his current location.</i>

148
00:06:56,512 --> 00:06:58,394
They must have found
something in your house.

149
00:06:58,545 --> 00:06:59,607
There was nothing to find.

150
00:06:59,771 --> 00:07:01,223
Why else would they issue an APB?

151
00:07:01,386 --> 00:07:03,225
Look, why don't we just
go back to the barn,

152
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,959
see what the hell they found,
and clean this mess up right now

153
00:07:06,116 --> 00:07:09,578
- before we dig ourselves in any deeper.
- Now might be our last shot at Guardo.

154
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:13,318
He's right.

155
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:38,446
We're all clear.

156
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,941
Looks like she's Guardo's cooch.

157
00:07:41,142 --> 00:07:42,413
What are we gonna do with her?

158
00:07:43,393 --> 00:07:46,025
I don't have too much concern
for Guardo's loved ones.

162
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,902
All right. Someone's here.
Don't get trigger happy.

163
00:08:03,084 --> 00:08:05,535
I want this guy alive long
enough to ask him questions.

164
00:08:18,027 --> 00:08:19,448
Hola.it's nydia.

165
00:08:21,245 --> 00:08:22,480
¿Esta Guardo?

166
00:08:28,414 --> 00:08:29,540
He's not there.

167
00:08:29,758 --> 00:08:30,774
Gracias.

168
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,619
What's she doing now?

169
00:08:39,345 --> 00:08:40,743
She's making lunch.

170
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,500
How's the new foot patrol going?

171
00:08:46,063 --> 00:08:48,804
It's OK, but community
relations is boring.

172
00:08:48,989 --> 00:08:50,188
We're not getting any action.

173
00:08:50,387 --> 00:08:52,675
Putting a friendly face
on the department is important.

174
00:08:52,838 --> 00:08:55,434
People need to feel comfortable
bringing their problems to us.

175
00:08:55,616 --> 00:08:57,159
Robbery/homicide faxed this over.

176
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,446
It's a composite of the man
seen leaving the side

177
00:08:59,627 --> 00:09:00,951
of the San Marcos house murders.

178
00:09:01,116 --> 00:09:02,784
Get copies made.
Pass it along.

179
00:09:04,492 --> 00:09:08,131
If you're here to get an update on Vic,
I'm too busy.

180
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,341
I'll try to find someone
to get you up to speed.

181
00:09:10,511 --> 00:09:13,777
Well, I might have to wait a while. Your
cupboard down there looks pretty bare.

182
00:09:13,932 --> 00:09:16,708
Half my men are out looking for Vic.
The other half are helping RHD

183
00:09:16,859 --> 00:09:18,220
with this house slaughter.

184
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:22,067
Would it make your life any easier
if I could get you additional personnel?

185
00:09:22,515 --> 00:09:23,546
Cops I need.

186
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:25,775
A future bill in my mailbox, I don't.

187
00:09:26,211 --> 00:09:27,845
You've been captain for a week.

188
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,604
Your homicide rate's quadrupled.

189
00:09:29,767 --> 00:09:30,875
What are you talking about?

190
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:32,863
The San Marcos triangle's
a no man's land

191
00:09:33,017 --> 00:09:35,250
between Wilshire,
Central and Farmington.

192
00:09:35,704 --> 00:09:38,935
The body count should've been
divided out in equal percentages.

193
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,566
Their Captains managed
to dump all 12 on you.

194
00:09:42,473 --> 00:09:43,526
How'd they do that?

195
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:44,961
You're low on the totem pole.

196
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:46,467
Just happened.

197
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:49,917
Crime stats will go down.

198
00:09:50,225 --> 00:09:52,298
All I need is time to make my input.

199
00:09:53,348 --> 00:09:55,218
Actually, things are
only gonna get tougher.

200
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,833
The Mexican police authority

201
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:58,812
is consolidating three prisons.

202
00:09:59,264 --> 00:10:01,729
So any inmates with 3 years
or less left on their sentences

203
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:02,895
are being released.

204
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,975
Based on their gang affiliations,

205
00:10:05,128 --> 00:10:07,162
you can expect a large
influx across the border

206
00:10:07,325 --> 00:10:08,541
and up in Farmington.

207
00:10:08,723 --> 00:10:10,175
Some are probably already here.

208
00:10:11,936 --> 00:10:12,943
OK.

209
00:10:13,437 --> 00:10:14,568
How does this work?

210
00:10:14,895 --> 00:10:16,701
I file the paperwork for a budget bump.

211
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:19,038
As far as the Wilshire
and Central Captains,

212
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:21,567
I'll try to persuade them
to even out the percentages

213
00:10:21,756 --> 00:10:23,952
so that our district
doesn't take the entire hit.

214
00:10:25,729 --> 00:10:26,746
It's that easy.

215
00:10:27,183 --> 00:10:29,396
No. But that's how it is.

216
00:10:32,464 --> 00:10:35,551
Now, uh, what can you
tell me about Mackey?

217
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:44,600
Jesus, how long does it
take to eat a salad?

218
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,424
We should be glad
she didn't take a dump.

219
00:10:50,492 --> 00:10:51,926
All right. She's gone.

220
00:10:57,446 --> 00:10:58,735
International prefix.

221
00:10:59,388 --> 00:11:01,294
Guardo's in mexico.
Goddammit.

222
00:11:01,476 --> 00:11:02,948
We're just gonna
have to wait then.

223
00:11:03,116 --> 00:11:04,133
Not necessarily.

224
00:11:04,314 --> 00:11:05,325
We can't rush this.

225
00:11:05,981 --> 00:11:07,016
We gotta handle it right.

226
00:11:07,184 --> 00:11:09,271
There's an APB out for me.
This doesn't wait.

227
00:11:13,646 --> 00:11:15,679
Look, neither one of you
can be seen with me.

228
00:11:18,184 --> 00:11:19,854
That means I gotta do this on my own.

229
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,797
Why don't you go back to the barn.

230
00:11:21,978 --> 00:11:23,005
Be my eyes and ears.

231
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,044
Gather as much intel
as you can.

232
00:11:40,514 --> 00:11:41,585
You lied to me, Aldo.

233
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:43,633
You told me you didn't
know where Guardo was.

234
00:11:43,797 --> 00:11:46,329
You keep coming around here
asking questions, the salvadorans

235
00:11:46,483 --> 00:11:47,545
are going to sniff it out.

236
00:11:47,695 --> 00:11:49,536
- You want me killed?
- You lie to me again,

237
00:11:49,731 --> 00:11:50,766
I'll do it for them.

238
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:53,285
Guardo's in San Miguel.

239
00:11:53,775 --> 00:11:54,791
Why?

240
00:11:55,318 --> 00:11:57,042
Last favor I have to do for you.

241
00:11:58,005 --> 00:11:59,021
Fine.

242
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,079
He's bringing a load
of scrips out next week.

243
00:12:02,515 --> 00:12:04,984
Mexi gangs are making
a big play into the game.

244
00:12:06,328 --> 00:12:07,998
How long has he been in Mexico?

245
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,500
As far as I know, just a couple of days.

246
00:12:13,668 --> 00:12:15,229
Where's your cell phone?

247
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,968
Now leave the keys and get out.

248
00:12:22,312 --> 00:12:23,329
Now get out.

249
00:12:24,219 --> 00:12:25,671
I'll return it with a full tank.

250
00:12:27,886 --> 00:12:29,030
Where have you two been?

251
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:31,654
Running down that lead
for robbery/homicide, what's going on?

252
00:12:31,812 --> 00:12:33,878
We called your phones.
Why didn't you pick up?

253
00:12:34,031 --> 00:12:36,526
We turned them off.
We didn't want to blow our cover.

254
00:12:36,683 --> 00:12:39,093
The only reason we're here
is we heard the APB out on Vic.

255
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,813
You got a search warrant for his house?

256
00:12:41,073 --> 00:12:42,356
I can't discuss the details.

257
00:12:42,546 --> 00:12:43,939
When was the last time you saw Vic?

258
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,004
Called this morning.
Said he was taking a personal day.

259
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,167
Wagenbach and I
need to speak with you two.

260
00:12:49,483 --> 00:12:50,500
Yeah.

261
00:12:50,808 --> 00:12:52,151
Yeah, let's get this cleared up.

262
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:57,280
Your official statement
taken the night Lemansky died

263
00:12:57,435 --> 00:13:00,011
says neither you, Vic, or Gardocki

264
00:13:00,194 --> 00:13:01,860
had ever been to the portillo auto body.

265
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:03,486
Yeah.
That sounds right.

266
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,861
So why did Vic have a map

267
00:13:05,453 --> 00:13:07,350
of the portillo auto body at his house?

268
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,350
Emolia told us that Vic
was gonna give her

269
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,908
$500 to deliver Lem to the salvadorans.

270
00:13:13,471 --> 00:13:15,255
We found that exact amount

271
00:13:15,415 --> 00:13:17,395
in an envelope with Vic's prints on it.

272
00:13:17,574 --> 00:13:18,983
You think Vic set Lem up?

273
00:13:20,025 --> 00:13:21,940
You're crazier than that ex wife of his.

274
00:13:23,508 --> 00:13:27,133
Emolia made numerous calls
to a salvadoran contact

275
00:13:27,285 --> 00:13:28,459
prior to Lemansky's death.

276
00:13:28,619 --> 00:13:30,252
Emolia was outed as a snitch.

277
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:32,932
She was probably calling
to beg for her life.

278
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,357
- That doesn't prove anything.
- So how do you explain

279
00:13:35,512 --> 00:13:37,840
- all this other evidence here?
- I don't know! Maybe...

280
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,043
maybe Emolia planted it.

281
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:40,226
Or you did.

282
00:13:40,376 --> 00:13:41,705
That's... That's gold.

283
00:13:42,673 --> 00:13:44,795
Please. Go on.
I really want to hear this one.

284
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:47,161
Well, you investigated
Vic for six months.

285
00:13:47,499 --> 00:13:49,950
You had every resource the department
had available to you.

286
00:13:50,109 --> 00:13:51,292
You came up
with nothing.

287
00:13:51,452 --> 00:13:53,499
Now, in the few days after Lem dies,

288
00:13:53,724 --> 00:13:56,122
you produce a C.I.
Willing to testify against him

289
00:13:56,325 --> 00:13:57,520
and the evidence to prove it?

290
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,675
Come on, man.

291
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,004
Sounds like you know a lot
about telling tall tales.

292
00:14:01,693 --> 00:14:02,694
Planting evidence.

293
00:14:02,853 --> 00:14:04,160
Practice makes perfect, right?

294
00:14:04,723 --> 00:14:05,897
Vic didn't kill Lem.

295
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:07,822
He's being set up.

296
00:14:08,338 --> 00:14:11,202
Look, it's no secret things ended ugly
between Vic and Emolia.

297
00:14:11,371 --> 00:14:13,765
Maybe this is just bitch's revenge.

298
00:14:13,922 --> 00:14:15,049
So why'd Vic run?

299
00:14:15,227 --> 00:14:18,948
Why isn't he here defending himself,
answering our questions instead of you?

300
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,340
He probably doesn't even
know you're looking for him.

301
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:22,567
Dutchboy, come on, man.

302
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:24,667
Are you really buying this bullshit?

303
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:25,952
The evidence is right here.

304
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:27,146
It's right here.

305
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:29,278
The real question is what
your involvement is.

306
00:14:29,608 --> 00:14:30,625
Vic...

307
00:14:30,843 --> 00:14:31,844
It's too late for him.

308
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,385
If you tell us where he's hiding,

309
00:14:33,544 --> 00:14:34,793
maybe you can save yourself.

310
00:14:39,047 --> 00:14:40,566
- Como estas, Niño.
- Como estas.

311
00:14:40,737 --> 00:14:41,741
Hermano.

312
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,911
An old amigo of mine bunkered down
in San Miguel.

313
00:14:45,502 --> 00:14:46,507
Name's Guardo Lima.

314
00:14:46,676 --> 00:14:48,723
I need you to repatriate him
to the states.

315
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:50,611
I'm looking for an amigo, too.

316
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:51,972
Byz lat soldier.

317
00:14:52,298 --> 00:14:53,700
Rumor is he's in east LA

318
00:14:57,005 --> 00:14:58,010
Rocha Garrenzi.

319
00:14:58,508 --> 00:15:00,865
Wanted for three murder
for hires in Mexico city.

320
00:15:01,156 --> 00:15:03,772
Got his address, aliases,
why couldn't you bust him down there?

321
00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:04,960
He was protected.

322
00:15:05,261 --> 00:15:07,141
Married a big shot
cattle rancher's daughter.

323
00:15:07,317 --> 00:15:09,383
Rocha got tired of
milking the same heifer.

324
00:15:09,552 --> 00:15:10,850
Took of with their two niños.

325
00:15:13,394 --> 00:15:15,685
I know about some mexican
drugs coming into town.

326
00:15:15,864 --> 00:15:17,019
I might have some leverage.

327
00:15:17,174 --> 00:15:18,534
If Rocha's arrested in LA,

328
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,915
the case could get caught up
in international courts.

329
00:15:21,074 --> 00:15:22,435
The mother and rich grandparents

330
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:24,141
are looking for a quicker solution.

331
00:15:24,953 --> 00:15:25,963
They're willing to pay.

332
00:15:26,117 --> 00:15:27,131
I'll cut you in.

333
00:15:28,811 --> 00:15:29,835
What about Rocha?

334
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,554
I don't care what you do with him.

335
00:15:31,939 --> 00:15:33,225
I just need the kids.

336
00:15:35,788 --> 00:15:36,918
I'll meet you back here.

337
00:15:37,463 --> 00:15:38,464
Oh, yeah.

338
00:15:38,658 --> 00:15:39,703
What did this Guardo do?

339
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:41,177
Why do you want him?

340
00:15:41,534 --> 00:15:42,539
He killed my friend.

341
00:15:52,068 --> 00:15:53,683
- Yeah.
- Hey, it's me.

342
00:15:53,836 --> 00:15:55,810
I tried to reach Shane,
but he wouldn't answer.

343
00:15:55,991 --> 00:15:58,333
Well, he's up in interrogation
with Kavanaugh and Dutch.

344
00:15:58,515 --> 00:15:59,550
What? What's going on?

345
00:15:59,713 --> 00:16:00,729
<i>It's not good.</i>

346
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:04,342
<i>Asher said they found a map
of Portillo's auto body in your garbage.</i>

347
00:16:04,582 --> 00:16:07,590
<i>Also a matchbook from the shop
Emolia's been working at.</i>

348
00:16:07,751 --> 00:16:09,099
Someone must have put them there.

349
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:11,822
They're building a case.
You gotta get back here and fight it.

350
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:14,137
But they can't prove anything.
I didn't do anything.

351
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:16,045
It's one thing to have
Emolia's statement.

352
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:17,792
Now they've got corroborating evidence.

353
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:19,739
<i>Just stay put and keep your ears open.</i>

354
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,039
Call Reyes' gang task force.

355
00:16:22,368 --> 00:16:25,696
You find out which byz lat is the
current king shithead over in east LA

356
00:16:25,881 --> 00:16:27,158
I'll call back in five.

357
00:16:29,802 --> 00:16:31,515
I heard they found evidence on Vic.

358
00:16:32,411 --> 00:16:33,446
Yeah.

359
00:16:33,973 --> 00:16:35,262
Maybe a little too much.

360
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:37,077
What do you mean?

361
00:16:39,746 --> 00:16:41,271
You ever here of Occam's razor?

362
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:44,620
The simplest answer is usually
the right one?

363
00:16:44,874 --> 00:16:47,071
Good.
Now apply that to the Lemansky case.

364
00:16:47,943 --> 00:16:50,103
Now all this evidence
is pointing to Vic.

365
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,006
Occam's razor would suggest he's guilty.

366
00:16:55,366 --> 00:16:57,817
Walter Chatton's a contemporary
of Occam's.

367
00:16:57,981 --> 00:16:59,015
Disputed the razor.

368
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:00,504
Coined his own anti razor.

369
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,934
What's that?

370
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:04,141
Chatton believed that
the world was too complex.

371
00:17:04,304 --> 00:17:06,555
Too many variables to assume
that the simplest answer

372
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:07,862
was always the correct one.

373
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,257
OK.

374
00:17:11,602 --> 00:17:13,137
What do you think is going on?

375
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,313
The salvadorans had a
contract out on your life

376
00:17:26,495 --> 00:17:27,747
yet you never left town.

377
00:17:27,911 --> 00:17:29,490
Why not just high-tail it out of here?

378
00:17:29,672 --> 00:17:31,523
I won't talk to anyone but Jon.

379
00:17:31,887 --> 00:17:32,921
Kavanaugh's not here,

380
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,519
and you need to answer my question.

381
00:17:34,683 --> 00:17:37,242
Only reason I'm in this mess
is because of you assholes.

382
00:17:42,652 --> 00:17:43,887
What's this?

383
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,422
I'm exploring another angle.
I'll catch you up later.

384
00:17:47,257 --> 00:17:48,274
Catch me up.

385
00:17:48,564 --> 00:17:49,581
Now.

386
00:17:56,434 --> 00:17:57,886
OK, we know Emolia was greenlit.

387
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:01,504
What if she was trying to gain favor
with Guardo to save her life?

388
00:18:01,722 --> 00:18:02,775
Cut a deal with him.

389
00:18:03,011 --> 00:18:05,770
They kill Lemansky, she pins it on Vic.

390
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:09,837
Mackey's out there right now,
and you're wasting time talking to her.

391
00:18:10,581 --> 00:18:12,035
This interrogation, it's over.

392
00:18:12,235 --> 00:18:14,468
Uh, no. It's not.
I'm not finished yet.

393
00:18:15,321 --> 00:18:17,681
We got every cop we have
out looking for Vic.

394
00:18:17,845 --> 00:18:21,365
Look, private tutoring might
buy you favor with your hot unis,

395
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:24,288
but it doesn't get us any closer
to scooping up Mackey.

396
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,354
If you want to spend your time
exploring pot shot theories than

397
00:18:27,554 --> 00:18:30,525
doing your job like you were supposed
to, we'd have Vic here right now.

398
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:32,346
And not some innocent witness.

399
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:33,630
Come on, Emolia.

400
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,837
What's up?

401
00:18:47,122 --> 00:18:48,139
I have some concerns

402
00:18:48,357 --> 00:18:50,463
about keeping Wagenbach
on the Lemansky case.

403
00:18:51,057 --> 00:18:52,546
- Why?
- I know he's your guy,

404
00:18:52,746 --> 00:18:55,703
but we may have a perception problem
should this case ever go to trial.

405
00:18:55,903 --> 00:18:56,919
How?

406
00:18:58,372 --> 00:19:00,078
The defense lawyer could argue...

407
00:19:00,732 --> 00:19:03,509
that Dutch's past relationship
with Corrine has...

408
00:19:03,745 --> 00:19:05,070
strained his objectivity.

409
00:19:05,887 --> 00:19:09,100
Dutch is protecting Vic
for his ex wife's sake?

410
00:19:09,971 --> 00:19:11,587
Their relationship's no secret.

411
00:19:12,495 --> 00:19:14,220
They could argue, that...

412
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:16,562
he has a personal stake in this.

413
00:19:17,052 --> 00:19:19,721
What about the personal
nature of the case with you?

414
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:23,642
I'm still an outsider.

415
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,038
IAD is always gonna have
an adversarial relationship

416
00:19:26,202 --> 00:19:27,799
with the people that we investigate.

417
00:19:29,742 --> 00:19:31,212
But the way this case is breaking,

418
00:19:32,174 --> 00:19:34,251
with the evidence that
we have to back it up...

419
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:36,927
this could be a big win for you.

420
00:19:38,154 --> 00:19:40,536
Finally getting Mackey off the street.

421
00:19:48,415 --> 00:19:50,392
They're building a
murder case against him.

422
00:19:51,336 --> 00:19:52,661
And it might actually stick.

423
00:19:53,896 --> 00:19:55,257
We can't let him take this hit.

424
00:20:03,338 --> 00:20:04,573
And what if, uh...

425
00:20:07,421 --> 00:20:09,618
What if I said that I was with Lem
or something?

426
00:20:11,016 --> 00:20:13,394
You know, had a grenade from the bust.

427
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:16,571
Just went off by accident.

428
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:22,008
Making up some bullshit
story is not gonna help.

429
00:20:22,843 --> 00:20:24,985
Plus you'd be admitting
to aiding and abetting.

430
00:20:30,294 --> 00:20:31,420
Yeah.

431
00:20:33,308 --> 00:20:34,343
Yeah, yeah.

432
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:37,030
We gotta do something for Vic.

433
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,709
The longer he's in the wind,
the guiltier he looks.

434
00:20:53,226 --> 00:20:54,442
Hey, slow your roll, homes.

435
00:20:54,933 --> 00:20:55,967
What's your business?

436
00:20:57,311 --> 00:20:58,346
I'm here to see Santi.

437
00:20:59,072 --> 00:21:01,654
Charley, nobody sees Jefe
without an appointment or a warrant.

438
00:21:01,853 --> 00:21:04,540
I know the local swines,
and I don't recognize your face.

439
00:21:04,758 --> 00:21:05,811
I work Farmington.

440
00:21:06,047 --> 00:21:09,040
Same place your shipment of
mexican scrips is headed to next week.

441
00:21:09,621 --> 00:21:11,310
I don't get to break bread with Santi,

442
00:21:11,981 --> 00:21:14,360
the scrips are gonna end up
in my evidence locker.

443
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,611
Hay un placa de Farmington aqui.

444
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:23,842
Sabe de los vales que vien.

445
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:29,168
All right. Let's go.

446
00:21:47,821 --> 00:21:49,037
All right. I need your gun.

447
00:21:56,636 --> 00:21:57,652
It's city issue.

448
00:21:58,143 --> 00:21:59,159
I can't do that.

449
00:21:59,341 --> 00:22:00,612
Well, then you can't see Santi.

450
00:22:06,982 --> 00:22:08,852
There.
No bullets work for you?

451
00:22:11,902 --> 00:22:13,954
Take a hit. Relax,ese.

452
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,167
No, thanks.
I'm good with the contact high.

453
00:22:18,728 --> 00:22:20,217
So what brings you to the east side?

454
00:22:20,453 --> 00:22:23,648
I need a location on a byz lat
still drying the Rio off his back.

455
00:22:24,374 --> 00:22:25,445
Name's Rocha.

456
00:22:27,225 --> 00:22:28,227
So let me guess,

457
00:22:28,953 --> 00:22:31,313
I hand him over,
and my scrips make it into town.

458
00:22:32,058 --> 00:22:33,455
Great minds think alike.

459
00:22:34,073 --> 00:22:35,416
Rocha's valuable to the bosses.

460
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,449
More valuable than your scrips?

461
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:40,698
You don't want to bust that shipment,
friend.

462
00:22:40,898 --> 00:22:42,622
You're not giving me any other choice.

463
00:22:44,383 --> 00:22:46,979
You bust it, you're declaring war.

464
00:22:48,027 --> 00:22:49,588
Not only on the byz lats,

465
00:22:50,146 --> 00:22:51,780
on all the mexi gangs.

466
00:22:57,757 --> 00:22:59,137
I didn't know there was a peace.

467
00:22:59,373 --> 00:23:01,283
I'm gonna give you some
money for your time.

468
00:23:02,045 --> 00:23:03,262
You forget my face.

469
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:04,927
And the scrips.

470
00:23:05,865 --> 00:23:07,165
I don't need your money.

471
00:23:08,018 --> 00:23:09,180
I need Rocha.

472
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:15,063
I'm offering you, an olive branch.

473
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:18,276
If you prefer shock and awe,

474
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:20,600
- I can arrange that, too.
- Back off, pendejo.

475
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,310
Lil' homie's shitfaced, ese.

476
00:23:25,073 --> 00:23:27,433
Junior missed the short bus
to school today.

477
00:23:29,647 --> 00:23:31,136
Tell him to lower that weapon.

478
00:23:40,491 --> 00:23:41,978
I ain't afraid of no cops.

479
00:23:43,103 --> 00:23:44,211
I'll do it.

480
00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:50,238
You got no bullets,cerdo.

481
00:23:51,407 --> 00:23:53,067
All that smoke make you forget?

482
00:23:53,477 --> 00:23:55,074
I got one in the chamber, dickhead.

483
00:23:56,654 --> 00:23:58,669
Your honeys were too stoned to notice.

484
00:24:00,012 --> 00:24:01,247
One of you shoots me,

485
00:24:01,464 --> 00:24:03,870
my muscle twitch takes
out your bad boy here.

486
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:07,791
So, either you and I are gonna leave
this basement together,

487
00:24:08,445 --> 00:24:10,442
or we're gonna leave
this life together.

488
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:13,195
You decide.

489
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,114
Stay back.

490
00:24:33,265 --> 00:24:34,327
Back off!

491
00:24:43,434 --> 00:24:45,522
You got to the next red to tell me
where Rocha is.

492
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:48,025
He's putting a hit
on a one-niner.

493
00:24:48,515 --> 00:24:49,532
Jumped my lieutenant.

494
00:24:49,714 --> 00:24:51,239
Which one-niner?
Which one?

495
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:53,254
Which one?

496
00:24:53,581 --> 00:24:54,688
It's going yellow!

497
00:24:55,775 --> 00:24:57,046
Name's big G.

498
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,825
He deals on 8th and Alameda.

499
00:24:59,115 --> 00:25:01,373
By Colvin High?
When's this going down?

500
00:25:01,693 --> 00:25:02,709
Later today.

501
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:06,014
Rocha doesn't show up, or you warn him,

502
00:25:06,401 --> 00:25:09,397
and I'm gonna show up with a hell
of a lot more than one in the chamber.

503
00:25:09,552 --> 00:25:10,642
Now get the hell out!

504
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,693
Well, shit, man.
At least slow down,ese.

505
00:25:12,893 --> 00:25:14,454
- Get out!
- Slow down, man!

506
00:25:29,673 --> 00:25:30,716
Big G.

507
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:34,728
Man, check y'all Niggaz later,
all right?

508
00:25:35,527 --> 00:25:37,197
- Yeah, so?
- Your lucky day.

509
00:25:37,595 --> 00:25:40,209
Someone's planning on killing you,
and I actually give a shit.

510
00:25:40,427 --> 00:25:42,188
Well, I guess I best
be going then, right?

511
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,441
You aren't going anywhere.

512
00:25:43,622 --> 00:25:44,839
If the killer can't find you,

513
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:47,634
then they can't kill you.
And that's gonna be a problem for me.

514
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,908
What if this vato does a drive-by & gets
some shots off before y'all get to him?

515
00:25:55,108 --> 00:25:57,190
This guy's a pro.
He's gonna step right up to you,

516
00:25:57,341 --> 00:25:59,149
put two in your chest
and one in your head.

517
00:25:59,336 --> 00:26:00,934
That's supposed to make me feel better?

518
00:26:01,115 --> 00:26:02,441
Get back to your spot!

519
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:08,554
- Thanks for coming in.
- Two unmarked police sedans have been

520
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,984
parked outside my house all day long.
I was a cop's wife long enough to know

521
00:26:12,135 --> 00:26:14,143
- that there's trouble.
- When was the last time

522
00:26:14,296 --> 00:26:16,508
- you saw or spoke to Vic?
- Last night.

523
00:26:16,925 --> 00:26:19,375
He said that someone was trying
to pin Lem's murder on him.

524
00:26:19,557 --> 00:26:21,899
A warrant was filed for his arrest
this morning.

525
00:26:22,771 --> 00:26:24,650
For what?
For Lem's murder?

526
00:26:24,868 --> 00:26:28,063
- He would never in a million years.
- The evidence is pointing in that mean.

527
00:26:28,226 --> 00:26:29,370
What evidence?

528
00:26:29,636 --> 00:26:32,396
Oh, my God. You don't believe this,
do you? I mean, there's no way

529
00:26:32,577 --> 00:26:35,500
- that he would ever do anything
- Kavanaugh has generated some proof.

530
00:26:35,972 --> 00:26:40,111
Listen, you need to prepare yourself
for this to go either way.

531
00:26:40,569 --> 00:26:42,947
You need to start preparing the kids.
OK?

532
00:26:47,486 --> 00:26:49,952
- Corrine, wait.
- What are you doing to my husband, huh?

533
00:26:50,152 --> 00:26:51,876
- Your ex husband.
- I know you hate Vic,

534
00:26:52,058 --> 00:26:54,426
but that doesn't give you the
right to destroy my family.

535
00:26:54,581 --> 00:26:57,575
Vic had Lemansky killed because he was
a threat. The evidence proves it.

536
00:26:57,758 --> 00:27:00,063
I don't believe you.
I don't believe any of this!

537
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,134
Let's go somewhere else,
we can talk in private.

538
00:27:03,316 --> 00:27:05,481
Get off of me.
Where do you want to go, to my house?

539
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,817
You want to put your hands all over
me again? Lean me up against the door?

540
00:27:08,998 --> 00:27:10,904
Try to screw me to get back at Vic?

541
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:13,715
In some demented, twisted way?

542
00:27:14,407 --> 00:27:15,551
I only asked you questions.

543
00:27:15,714 --> 00:27:17,548
Yeah, right. You used your badge

544
00:27:17,729 --> 00:27:18,982
to get into my house,

545
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:21,015
and then you tried to touch me.

546
00:27:21,578 --> 00:27:22,866
I didn't feel safe.

547
00:27:23,483 --> 00:27:24,917
- Corrine...
- No, listen to me.

548
00:27:25,171 --> 00:27:26,206
He...

549
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,147
He entered my house
under false pretenses.

550
00:27:29,365 --> 00:27:31,743
And then he tried
to sexually assault me.

551
00:27:32,016 --> 00:27:33,296
I want to file charges.

552
00:27:34,204 --> 00:27:36,455
- Are you sure about this?
- Either take my statement,

553
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,434
or I'm gonna file charges
somewhere else.

554
00:27:52,987 --> 00:27:54,149
Just stay there.

555
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,376
Drop it!

556
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:10,779
All right.
Where are you keeping your kids?

557
00:28:10,978 --> 00:28:12,167
Who the hell are you?

558
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:13,502
Your father-in-law hired me.

559
00:28:13,718 --> 00:28:14,916
All he wants are the kids.

560
00:28:15,116 --> 00:28:17,403
If you tell me where they're at,
then I'll let you go.

561
00:28:18,729 --> 00:28:20,762
The cavalry's gonna show up any minute.

562
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:22,396
The Moreland motel.

563
00:28:23,412 --> 00:28:24,475
Room 8.

564
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:25,938
All right. Good.

565
00:28:29,061 --> 00:28:30,495
What about letting me go, man?

566
00:28:30,713 --> 00:28:32,564
Yeah. I feel like shit about that.

567
00:28:34,481 --> 00:28:35,543
How's Corrine?

568
00:28:35,824 --> 00:28:37,040
She's filing charges.

569
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:38,765
Sticking to her guns.

570
00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:40,326
Attempted sexual ag.

571
00:28:40,707 --> 00:28:42,704
- You believe her?
- I believe she believes it.

572
00:28:42,884 --> 00:28:45,753
I wouldn't have thought Kavanaugh
was capable of something like that.

573
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:48,076
Makes you wonder
what else he's capable of.

574
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,931
Yesterday, you insinuated Emolia
might have been lying.

575
00:28:54,113 --> 00:28:55,202
Setting Vic up.

576
00:28:55,383 --> 00:28:56,963
Today, not a peep. Why?

577
00:29:01,502 --> 00:29:04,062
Maybe considering everything
we suspect Vic's done,

578
00:29:04,316 --> 00:29:06,476
you see him going down
for this as some sort of...

579
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:08,810
karmic justice whether he did it or not.

580
00:29:09,016 --> 00:29:10,269
I know he's a bad guy.

581
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:12,756
The evidence is the evidence.

582
00:29:13,555 --> 00:29:15,533
It's tempting to let sleeping dogs lie.

583
00:29:16,294 --> 00:29:18,273
Especially
when the dog's as rabid as Vic.

584
00:29:18,727 --> 00:29:22,684
But I've got one chance
to right this ship, Dutch.

585
00:29:23,047 --> 00:29:24,938
To do it,
I have to put an end to a pattern

586
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,863
of silent deals and moral exchanges

587
00:29:28,063 --> 00:29:30,496
that have steered this place off course.

588
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:32,329
That means to pursue the truth.

589
00:29:33,636 --> 00:29:34,992
And the truth only.

590
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,474
Yesterday, I thought Emolia
was lying to me.

591
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:47,953
I still do.

592
00:29:48,715 --> 00:29:51,130
I can't prove it,
but I'm starting to think that Kavanaugh

593
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:52,655
is the one that fed her the lie.

594
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,886
It's one thing believing Vic's innocent,

595
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,991
but to accuse Kavanaugh,
of setting Vic up,

596
00:29:58,154 --> 00:30:01,150
- that's a whole other can of worms.
- He's already lied to me once.

597
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:03,709
He said he met Emolia yesterday
at Sid's coffee.

598
00:30:03,975 --> 00:30:05,736
I pulled footage
from the 101 freeway cam.

599
00:30:05,953 --> 00:30:07,043
Sid's is clear.

600
00:30:07,497 --> 00:30:09,348
No Kavanaugh. No Emolia.

601
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,216
The truth... May not always
lead us down the path we want.

602
00:30:20,177 --> 00:30:22,446
But it's the only way to fix this place.

603
00:30:22,628 --> 00:30:24,752
Get Emolia and bring her back down here.

604
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:44,492
- You brought their mother?
- She insisted on coming.

605
00:30:46,616 --> 00:30:47,669
Where's Guardo?

606
00:30:48,538 --> 00:30:50,190
I'm really sorry. I couldn't get to him.

607
00:30:50,372 --> 00:30:51,389
That's bullshit!

608
00:30:51,552 --> 00:30:54,455
- You didn't tell me how connected he's.
- I couldn't get close enough

609
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:58,015
- to talk to him let alone shanghal him.
- I don't giva shit how connected he is!

610
00:30:58,196 --> 00:31:00,492
I kept my part of the deal.
I expect you to keep yours.

611
00:31:00,656 --> 00:31:02,616
He's got too many people on his payroll.

612
00:31:02,816 --> 00:31:05,574
- It's impossible. I'm sorry.
- Maybe he's got you on his payroll.

613
00:31:05,737 --> 00:31:08,841
Look, I'll make it up to you, huh?
These people are paying me well

614
00:31:09,023 --> 00:31:10,094
for delivering these kids.

615
00:31:10,275 --> 00:31:12,036
I'll increase your cut.
Plus...

616
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:15,128
- Ask any other favor.
- I don't want your goddamn money.

617
00:31:15,382 --> 00:31:16,453
I want Guardo!

618
00:31:17,415 --> 00:31:19,376
Look, I'm sorry,
but there's nothing I can do.

619
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:23,805
Goddamnit!

620
00:31:30,607 --> 00:31:31,624
All right.

621
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,837
Can you get close enough to
him to give him a message?

622
00:31:35,158 --> 00:31:36,265
I might be able to do that.

623
00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:37,990
Then you meet me here in 2 hours.

624
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:42,601
It's nonsense.

625
00:31:44,889 --> 00:31:45,940
I'll call you back.

626
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:49,354
Uh, Captain.

627
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:52,204
- Why's Emolia here?
- I need to ask her some questions.

628
00:31:52,585 --> 00:31:53,602
Great.

629
00:31:53,765 --> 00:31:56,597
- I'll come with you.
- Uh, I prefer some alone time with her.

630
00:31:57,156 --> 00:31:59,298
But you can't question her
without me being there.

631
00:31:59,988 --> 00:32:03,183
The last time I checked,
I was captain of this house not you.

632
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:06,614
You want to watch, there's a front row
seat for you in the observation room.

633
00:32:06,814 --> 00:32:07,831
It's part of her deal.

634
00:32:08,502 --> 00:32:10,499
She's been burned
by the people here before.

635
00:32:10,835 --> 00:32:11,852
And...

636
00:32:12,061 --> 00:32:13,785
I promised I wouldn't leave her alone.

637
00:32:17,126 --> 00:32:18,197
Fine.

638
00:32:18,417 --> 00:32:19,815
But you just listen.

639
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:24,698
Emolia, I'm the one who said
those things about Sebastio.

640
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,896
It wasn't Vic.

641
00:32:26,132 --> 00:32:28,166
He always took care
of you two, you know that.

642
00:32:28,383 --> 00:32:30,870
Come on. Emolia, please.
Don't do this to him.

643
00:32:31,469 --> 00:32:32,594
Emolia.

644
00:32:44,487 --> 00:32:45,558
<i>I love this room.</i>

645
00:32:45,776 --> 00:32:47,029
<i>It's my favorite one here.</i>

646
00:32:47,755 --> 00:32:48,772
<i>It's kind of ugly.</i>

647
00:32:49,552 --> 00:32:50,569
Cold.

648
00:32:51,668 --> 00:32:53,211
It's not much to look at.

649
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:56,425
But it brings the truth out in people.

650
00:32:58,113 --> 00:33:00,818
I fixed a lot of wrongs
inside these walls.

651
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:03,687
That's what we do in here, Emolia.

652
00:33:04,268 --> 00:33:05,303
Find the truth.

653
00:33:05,594 --> 00:33:07,191
I already told you the truth.

654
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,232
That bullshit story you've been spinning
about Vic? I don't buy it.

655
00:33:10,459 --> 00:33:11,566
That's your problem then.

656
00:33:11,784 --> 00:33:15,439
Guardo wanted to have you killed,
you made up a story about Vic

657
00:33:15,657 --> 00:33:17,418
so that you could
get witness protection.

658
00:33:17,618 --> 00:33:19,469
Now does that sound about right?

659
00:33:23,648 --> 00:33:25,246
You can answer her.
It's all right.

660
00:33:26,934 --> 00:33:28,858
Vic wanted Lem dead.

661
00:33:29,094 --> 00:33:31,745
Gave me his location to give to Guardo.
That's it.

662
00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:39,690
Officer Lowe, Officer Asher, I need you.

663
00:33:41,614 --> 00:33:42,758
I want you out this room.

664
00:33:43,101 --> 00:33:44,118
That's not gonna happen.

665
00:33:44,301 --> 00:33:47,114
- The assistant chief himself...
- I don't care what deal you made.

666
00:33:47,332 --> 00:33:49,010
Either you leave this room on your own,

667
00:33:49,173 --> 00:33:51,315
or I'll have these two
officers do it for you.

668
00:33:57,893 --> 00:33:58,910
You all right?

669
00:33:59,236 --> 00:34:00,253
Yeah.

670
00:34:11,859 --> 00:34:13,021
<i>I've red your jacket.</i>

671
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,726
You've been in a lot of trouble,

672
00:34:15,925 --> 00:34:18,634
but nothing like this pissing match
between Vic and Kavanaugh.

673
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,684
I'm getting witness protection.

674
00:34:21,939 --> 00:34:23,300
Starting a new life.

675
00:34:23,638 --> 00:34:25,943
- I'm doing OK.
- You're not doing OK.

676
00:34:26,506 --> 00:34:27,541
You're trapped.

677
00:34:27,741 --> 00:34:28,757
You're scared.

678
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:31,172
You're living in fear.

679
00:34:33,078 --> 00:34:35,074
You're ping-ponging
between these two men

680
00:34:35,283 --> 00:34:37,896
who have done nothing
but use and abuse you,

681
00:34:38,095 --> 00:34:40,365
<i>and I'd have more sympathy for you</i>

682
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:43,550
<i>except you let them do it for a buck.</i>

683
00:34:43,877 --> 00:34:44,985
<i>For my son.</i>

684
00:34:45,221 --> 00:34:46,237
<i>Your son?</i>

685
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,178
What are you gonna tell your son
about this time of your life?

686
00:34:50,104 --> 00:34:53,461
That you let Vic and Kavanaugh
steal away your soul?

687
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,907
<i>Or that you were lost and found
the strength to free yourself?</i>

688
00:35:00,051 --> 00:35:01,383
I know you're scared.

689
00:35:01,637 --> 00:35:02,763
I'd be, too.

690
00:35:04,941 --> 00:35:06,884
But I can offer you...

691
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:09,534
a way out...
if you let me.

692
00:35:12,501 --> 00:35:14,643
- How?
- First you have to tell me the truth.

693
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,965
<i>You've helped this
department out before...</i>

694
00:35:18,782 --> 00:35:20,724
<i>and I can see about
arranging protection.</i>

695
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:23,189
<i>I'm offering you...</i>

696
00:35:23,553 --> 00:35:24,587
<i>a way...</i>

697
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:27,456
<i>to be rid of these men forever.</i>

698
00:35:27,637 --> 00:35:28,645
<i>Take it.</i>

699
00:35:28,863 --> 00:35:32,194
Because they're leading you down
a path that is destroying you...

700
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,793
your son...

701
00:35:35,554 --> 00:35:37,134
and everything around you.

702
00:35:38,405 --> 00:35:39,476
You know it.

703
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:43,723
<i>Everything...</i>

704
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,371
<i>is gonna be all right.</i>

705
00:35:46,683 --> 00:35:48,099
<i>You're gonna be ok. I promise.</i>

706
00:35:50,595 --> 00:35:51,611
I need to, uh...

707
00:35:52,991 --> 00:35:54,498
I need to talk to Captain Wyms.

708
00:35:59,327 --> 00:36:00,335
I have to talk...

709
00:36:00,553 --> 00:36:02,441
- Please.
- It's ok. It's ok.

710
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,012
But first you got to tell me the truth.

711
00:36:24,371 --> 00:36:25,587
I fed her the story.

712
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:29,599
Coerced her statement.

713
00:36:30,235 --> 00:36:32,123
Planted the evidence in Mackey's house.

714
00:36:34,157 --> 00:36:36,226
But I framed a guilty man.

715
00:36:52,676 --> 00:36:55,344
- You guys make sure you weren't tailed?
- Yeah. Where's Guardo?

716
00:36:55,508 --> 00:36:56,524
Tonio boned me.

717
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,975
- Couldn't bag the whale.
- Well, what do we do now?

718
00:36:59,992 --> 00:37:01,915
Switch bait.
Nydia home?

719
00:37:02,132 --> 00:37:03,149
Yeah.

720
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:05,509
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, man.

721
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,612
- What's the plan?
- Just follow my lead.

722
00:37:20,557 --> 00:37:22,282
- Nydia Hernandez?
- Yes.

723
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,553
Detective Mackey.

724
00:37:24,097 --> 00:37:25,975
This is Detectives
Vendrell and Gardocki.

725
00:37:26,357 --> 00:37:27,373
What's going on?

726
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:30,133
We have information that someone's
planning on kidnapping you.

727
00:37:30,295 --> 00:37:32,184
- What?
- Our department's been investigating

728
00:37:32,347 --> 00:37:33,817
a mexican drug lord named Salceda.

729
00:37:34,362 --> 00:37:37,049
An informant of ours...
Told us that he's...

730
00:37:39,522 --> 00:37:42,009
And we heard he's planning to kill
your boyfriend Guardo.

731
00:37:42,318 --> 00:37:44,133
To take over his drug
protection business.

732
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,221
I don't know any Guardo.

733
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:49,686
- You're not his girlfriend?
- No.

734
00:37:50,013 --> 00:37:51,066
Never heard of the guy.

735
00:37:52,065 --> 00:37:54,806
Wow.
Then maybe we're looking for another...

736
00:37:55,187 --> 00:37:56,767
Nydia Hernandez.

737
00:37:58,128 --> 00:37:59,477
Well, I'm sorry to disturb you

738
00:37:59,676 --> 00:38:00,911
if you're not his girlfriend,

739
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,654
you got nothing to worry about.

740
00:38:06,811 --> 00:38:07,828
Wait.

741
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,587
Guardo told me never to talk to cops.

742
00:38:14,332 --> 00:38:16,202
Why would someone want to kidnap me?

743
00:38:16,456 --> 00:38:18,035
It's Guardo Salceda wants.

744
00:38:18,943 --> 00:38:20,196
But he's in Mexico.

745
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,349
Our C.I. has learned that he plans on

746
00:38:22,548 --> 00:38:24,509
kidnapping you to use you as bait

747
00:38:24,781 --> 00:38:26,542
to lure Guardo back to LA.

748
00:38:26,796 --> 00:38:29,084
We were worried
we weren't going to get to you in time.

749
00:38:29,356 --> 00:38:32,374
We need to get you into a safehouse
while we hunt down Salceda.

750
00:38:34,031 --> 00:38:35,620
Well, I should call Guardo. Warn him.

751
00:38:35,774 --> 00:38:38,188
No, we don't know who's listening
on his side of the line.

752
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,113
Our intel says it's an inside job.

753
00:38:41,093 --> 00:38:42,255
We have to move you now.

754
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:46,284
- How long is this gonna take?
- A day. Two at the most.

755
00:38:46,501 --> 00:38:49,588
Ronnie will take you to the safehouse
immediately. We'll pack some clothes

756
00:38:49,769 --> 00:38:52,638
- for you. Meet you there, all right?
- Come on. We better get going.

757
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:57,846
What the hell are you doing?

758
00:38:58,028 --> 00:38:59,262
What the hell are you doing?

759
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,751
Vic?

760
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:04,600
Just pack.

761
00:39:05,054 --> 00:39:06,088
I'll explain later.

762
00:39:25,286 --> 00:39:26,774
I never cheated on anything before.

763
00:39:28,426 --> 00:39:29,861
The first time I do, I get caught

764
00:39:30,693 --> 00:39:33,707
taking the dirtiest man
I ever met off the street.

765
00:39:34,197 --> 00:39:36,176
You set another cop up for murder.

766
00:39:36,648 --> 00:39:39,044
Threw away your career.
I fail to see the humor.

767
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,283
I guess I didn't have enough practice

768
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,696
planting evidence,
manipulating witnesses and...

769
00:39:45,878 --> 00:39:48,256
- covering my tracks.
- You sacrificed your integrity

770
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:49,581
for Vic Mackey.

771
00:39:50,635 --> 00:39:53,558
You are better than that.
You used to be better than him.

772
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:54,865
I still am.

773
00:39:58,296 --> 00:39:59,712
Take his gun and badge.

774
00:40:09,731 --> 00:40:12,037
You're under arrest for interfering in
police business

775
00:40:12,255 --> 00:40:13,653
under color of authority.

776
00:40:14,835 --> 00:40:16,995
I assume other charges will follow.

777
00:40:18,495 --> 00:40:19,512
Put him in the cage?

778
00:40:19,748 --> 00:40:21,581
No. Take him straight to police one.

779
00:40:21,781 --> 00:40:23,233
Cuff him in front. Keep it quiet.

780
00:40:32,502 --> 00:40:34,445
At least I have Mackey out of my life.

781
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,331
He's not my problem anymore.

782
00:40:38,275 --> 00:40:39,291
He's yours.

783
00:41:16,214 --> 00:41:17,231
What's this?

784
00:41:17,866 --> 00:41:20,081
It's the message I want you
to deliver to Guardo.

785
00:41:20,971 --> 00:41:22,060
A necklace?

786
00:41:22,838 --> 00:41:24,399
Deliver it to him in person.

787
00:41:24,708 --> 00:41:26,723
You tell him that
Nydia's been kidnapped.

788
00:41:27,304 --> 00:41:28,919
If he ever wants to see her again,

789
00:41:29,628 --> 00:41:32,550
he has 24 hours to get 50 grand in cash,

790
00:41:32,841 --> 00:41:34,512
in person to LA.

791
00:41:38,026 --> 00:41:39,587
I don't think I want any part of this.

792
00:41:39,859 --> 00:41:41,983
Let alone what you do to
him after you've got him.

793
00:41:42,154 --> 00:41:44,868
- Vic, come on. Think about this.
- You're delivering a message.

794
00:41:45,122 --> 00:41:46,556
Your involvement ends there.

795
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:49,525
And I'll forgo my cut
for the returned kids.

796
00:41:54,248 --> 00:41:55,254
OK.

797
00:41:56,826 --> 00:42:00,040
You tell Guardo, call Nydia's cell phone
when he wants to set the meet.

798
00:42:03,525 --> 00:42:04,989
Hey, hey. A ransom?

799
00:42:05,207 --> 00:42:07,022
The last thing we need
is more dirty money.

800
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:08,892
I don't give a shit about the 50 grand.

801
00:42:09,346 --> 00:42:11,397
Once Guardo finds out
Nydia's been kidnapped,

802
00:42:11,597 --> 00:42:12,922
he'll have to come to LA.

803
00:42:13,412 --> 00:42:15,662
Word gets out he can't protect
his own girlfriend,

804
00:42:15,898 --> 00:42:18,330
who's gonna trust him
to protect their drugs?

805
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,453
Vic, don't do this.

806
00:42:21,889 --> 00:42:22,905
Please.

807
00:42:23,377 --> 00:42:24,430
Lem's gone.

808
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,911
Nothing we can do can bring him back.

809
00:42:29,471 --> 00:42:32,049
You push this too fare, man
we're gonna lose you, too.

810
00:42:36,678 --> 00:42:38,017
Guardo has to pay.

811
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,990
- Where's Nydia?
- The bedroom sleeping.

812
00:42:56,279 --> 00:42:57,749
This just turned into a kidnapping.

813
00:42:58,149 --> 00:42:59,165
What do you mean?

814
00:42:59,383 --> 00:43:00,581
Vic sent a message to Guardo.

815
00:43:00,772 --> 00:43:03,205
If he doesn't meet us in 24 hours,
she dies.

816
00:43:03,937 --> 00:43:05,298
What do we do if he doesn't show?

817
00:43:05,498 --> 00:43:06,533
Oh, he'll show.

818
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:07,967
This her cell phone?

819
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:09,274
Yeah. If he does show,

820
00:43:09,474 --> 00:43:12,197
- What do we do with her?
- I don't know what I'm gonna do yet.

821
00:43:12,379 --> 00:43:13,395
Vic, this is wrong.

822
00:43:14,211 --> 00:43:16,843
You two don't have to be involved
in this. Go back to the barn.

823
00:43:17,043 --> 00:43:18,259
Keep your distance from me.

824
00:43:26,682 --> 00:43:27,698
Good job.

825
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:29,895
How's he doing?

826
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:32,003
He's beautiful.
I'll see you.

827
00:43:32,198 --> 00:43:33,215
How are you?

828
00:43:33,433 --> 00:43:34,450
I'm exhausted.

829
00:43:35,194 --> 00:43:37,263
He's been colicky.
Keeping me up all night.

830
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:40,568
Well, I do have some good news
I wanted to tell you face to face.

831
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:43,594
Any excuse to get out of the house.
I need some adult time.

832
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,190
You passed the sergeant's exam.

833
00:43:47,225 --> 00:43:49,131
- Congratulations.
- Oh, God.

834
00:43:49,785 --> 00:43:50,874
Bless you.

835
00:43:51,997 --> 00:43:54,956
So I start wearing these as soon as
my maternity leave is over, huh?

836
00:43:55,192 --> 00:43:58,786
The slot's available
effective immediately.

837
00:43:59,077 --> 00:44:02,072
If you don't take it, your name
goes back to the bottom of the list.

838
00:44:03,465 --> 00:44:05,626
You mean I have to
come back to work right away?

839
00:44:05,916 --> 00:44:08,258
Or you pick another slot if it opens up.

840
00:44:08,675 --> 00:44:10,545
That's what happens
when men make the rules.

841
00:44:10,727 --> 00:44:12,724
You sleep on it,
let me know in the morning.

842
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:15,218
Hey, either of you two
seen or heard from Vic?

843
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:17,941
- No.
- If you do, tell him he can go home.

844
00:44:20,828 --> 00:44:21,844
Why is that?

845
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:24,620
Because the case against
him has been dropped.

846
00:44:24,929 --> 00:44:27,107
So, if he is still in the country,

847
00:44:27,525 --> 00:44:29,485
tell him he can sleep
in his own bed tonight.

848
00:44:32,572 --> 00:44:34,911
You're clear.
You can go back to work.

849
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:37,235
Just let Nydia go.

850
00:44:40,085 --> 00:44:41,229
We got a reprieve.

851
00:44:41,556 --> 00:44:45,014
Dutchboy and Claudette saved our asses.
Just wake her up and get her out'f here.

852
00:44:45,213 --> 00:44:46,938
She's how we're going to get to Guardo.

853
00:44:47,428 --> 00:44:49,728
What happened to no more
unilateral decisions.

854
00:44:50,109 --> 00:44:51,180
Shane's right.

855
00:44:51,979 --> 00:44:53,558
I want this guy just as bad as you,

856
00:44:53,776 --> 00:44:58,605
- but not like this. This is too risky.
- Every second he gets to breathe

857
00:44:58,841 --> 00:45:01,378
and Lem doesn't is unacceptable.

858
00:45:08,077 --> 00:45:09,366
I'll do it myself.

859
00:45:09,729 --> 00:45:10,966
What is your problem?

860
00:45:11,546 --> 00:45:13,743
Can you listen to anybody but yourself?

861
00:45:14,406 --> 00:45:17,183
Lem wouldn't listen about going
to Mexico. He's dead because of it.

862
00:45:17,401 --> 00:45:18,899
Is that what you want, man, huh?

863
00:45:19,135 --> 00:45:20,152
You want to die?

864
00:45:20,515 --> 00:45:22,619
You want to go to jail?
You want us to go to jail?

865
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:38,941
Go home. Get some shut eye.

866
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,463
I'll guard the fort for the night.

867
00:45:53,495 --> 00:45:54,693
I'll just be a minute.

868
00:46:01,083 --> 00:46:02,481
You've been a very busy boy.

869
00:46:02,953 --> 00:46:04,104
Planting evidence.

870
00:46:04,503 --> 00:46:05,756
Coercing witnesses.

871
00:46:06,645 --> 00:46:08,025
Assaulting my ex wife.

872
00:46:08,842 --> 00:46:10,040
I learned from the master.

873
00:46:13,726 --> 00:46:16,027
I told you you weren't ready
to play at this level.

874
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:19,364
Wouldn't have mattered even if I was.

875
00:46:20,435 --> 00:46:21,451
The truth is...

876
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,212
isn't your time yet.

877
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:25,730
But it'll happen.

878
00:46:26,747 --> 00:46:29,016
The universe will take out
its trash when it's ready.

879
00:46:29,397 --> 00:46:31,212
Looks like it already has.

880
00:46:33,609 --> 00:46:35,098
You corrupted everything around you.

881
00:46:36,368 --> 00:46:39,386
Turned a good man like Lemansky
into a thug and a thief.

882
00:46:40,003 --> 00:46:41,383
And you got him killed for it.

883
00:46:43,017 --> 00:46:44,741
I tried to become you for a minute.

884
00:46:45,086 --> 00:46:46,121
But...

885
00:46:46,666 --> 00:46:47,669
it wasn't worth it.

886
00:46:49,086 --> 00:46:50,102
I'll take my lumps.

887
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,337
Go back to my life.

888
00:46:52,789 --> 00:46:53,824
But I won't be the one

889
00:46:54,024 --> 00:46:56,075
hearing my dead friend's
screams in my head.

890
00:46:59,218 --> 00:47:01,632
You preach
all the existential bullshit you want.

891
00:47:02,703 --> 00:47:04,646
But I'm the one going home to my bed

892
00:47:05,336 --> 00:47:06,570
while you're still here.

893
00:47:08,331 --> 00:47:09,375
I'm at peace.

894
00:47:11,426 --> 00:47:12,443
Are you?

895
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,257
Soon enough.
