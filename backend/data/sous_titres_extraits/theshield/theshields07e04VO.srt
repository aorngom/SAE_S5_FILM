1
00:00:00,847 --> 00:00:02,082
Previously on The Shield...

2
00:00:02,117 --> 00:00:03,844
This is city controller-
Robert Martin.

3
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:07,084
We had a deal... your daughter's
reputation for my job.

4
00:00:07,119 --> 00:00:08,703
Agent Olivia Murray,
I.C.E.

5
00:00:08,738 --> 00:00:11,590
What's your
unofficial curiosity?

6
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:13,645
Our bureau Chief
shut down my investigation.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,655
If I can tie the cartel
to a local player,

8
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:16,817
Olivia's back in the hood.

9
00:00:16,852 --> 00:00:18,593
OK, Barn's at your disposal.

10
00:00:19,464 --> 00:00:21,514
The armenians
know about the money train!

11
00:00:21,549 --> 00:00:22,932
They green-lit
your family.

12
00:00:22,967 --> 00:00:24,479
What the hell
have you gotten us into?

13
00:00:24,514 --> 00:00:25,767
This is Cruz Pezuela.

14
00:00:25,802 --> 00:00:28,366
He's representing a company
that has backing

15
00:00:28,401 --> 00:00:30,726
of various Mexican
investment interests.

16
00:00:30,761 --> 00:00:32,479
The Mexican mob
is buying up Farmington?

17
00:00:32,514 --> 00:00:35,001
Blackmail... that's how Pezuela's
getting everyone onboard.

18
00:00:36,556 --> 00:00:37,955
Do you want to give me a clue
what all this is about?

19
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,613
The intel box
the mexis are using

20
00:00:39,648 --> 00:00:41,662
to blackmail
their way up to the top.

21
00:00:41,697 --> 00:00:43,924
You made it look like
it was sold out to the armos.

22
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:47,100
Which lit the fuse for
the blood feud we're stirring up

23
00:00:47,135 --> 00:00:48,438
between Rezian
and the Mexicans.

24
00:00:48,473 --> 00:00:49,549
Nicely done.

25
00:00:49,584 --> 00:00:51,073
Where's that
blackmail box?

26
00:00:51,108 --> 00:00:52,424
You couldn't
resist the temptation

27
00:00:52,459 --> 00:00:53,960
to use it
for your own purposes.

28
00:00:53,995 --> 00:00:55,385
I am now in possession
of the box

29
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,251
until the time is right
to turn it over to justice.

30
00:00:57,286 --> 00:00:58,283
What about the files?

31
00:00:58,318 --> 00:01:00,918
Whatever's in that box
is giving Rezian big balls.

32
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:04,415
<I>He's taken something
that belongs to me.

33
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,839
I took your money-train cash.

34
00:01:05,874 --> 00:01:07,838
I'm not afraid to come here
and tell you about it.

35
00:01:07,873 --> 00:01:09,496
Instead of the $2 million
that I don't have,

36
00:01:09,531 --> 00:01:11,224
I'm gonna grant you
three wishes.

37
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:12,943
Once you've had
your three meals,

38
00:01:12,978 --> 00:01:17,057
we walk away from the table fat,
happy, and even.

39
00:01:17,092 --> 00:01:19,916
I'm sick of walking around
half the day smiling at a guy

40
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:21,623
who put a grenade
in Lem's lap.

41
00:01:21,658 --> 00:01:23,107
We need shane
right now.

42
00:01:23,142 --> 00:01:25,391
We're gonna make him feel safe.
Just like old times.

43
00:01:25,426 --> 00:01:27,787
We're gonna get through this,
come through the other side.

44
00:01:27,822 --> 00:01:29,131
Thank you.

45
00:01:31,911 --> 00:01:33,105
Never mind
the illegal drinking.

46
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,027
You were supposed to be
watching your brother Matthew.

47
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:36,859
He's your responsibility,
not mine.

48
00:01:36,894 --> 00:01:39,063
Hey! Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?!

49
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:41,298
The only parent that's ever
around to listen to me.

50
00:01:43,235 --> 00:01:45,645
Don't you ever
push your mother like that!

51
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,423
Do you understand?!

52
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:51,549
www.1000fr.com presents...

53
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,110
Hi.

54
00:01:53,145 --> 00:01:55,408
Uh, I need
to talk to cass.

55
00:01:55,443 --> 00:01:57,624
I'm sorry things
got out of control before.

56
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,094
We're already
running late for school.

57
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:01,533
I don't need to get any worse.

58
00:02:01,568 --> 00:02:04,165
I already grounded her.
She's furious.

59
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,843
You know what, this may
not be the best time to talk.

60
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:11,475
Please, Corrine.
It's the time I have.

61
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,334
Cassidy?
Your father's here.

62
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,397
Open the door, please.

63
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:28,836
Cass?

64
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:34,854
Listen, kid.

65
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:37,025
I apologize
for losing my temper.

66
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:40,924
I grabbed you way harder
than I intended, and I'm sorry.

67
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,659
Do you hear me?

68
00:02:45,694 --> 00:02:46,840
Fine.

69
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,397
All right,
now, for your part,

70
00:02:50,432 --> 00:02:53,003
I think you owe your mother
and I an explanation.

71
00:02:53,038 --> 00:02:56,027
We trusted you
with certain responsibilities.

72
00:02:56,062 --> 00:02:57,986
You let us down.

73
00:03:01,562 --> 00:03:04,043
Hey.
We're talking to you.

74
00:03:04,078 --> 00:03:07,907
Apology accepted.
I'm ready to go.

75
00:03:08,714 --> 00:03:09,644
We'll finish this later.

76
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:10,889
You made a big mistake.

77
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,139
It could have your brother had some

78
00:03:12,174 --> 00:03:14,706
- goddamn serious consequences.
- Please don't swear.

79
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:17,466
I apologized,
and now I'm waiting

80
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:19,852
to hear an explanation
about your behavior.

81
00:03:19,887 --> 00:03:22,190
<I>How do you explain
your behavior?

82
00:03:22,225 --> 00:03:23,824
I don't have to
explain myself.

83
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:25,250
All the investigations???

84
00:03:25,285 --> 00:03:26,461
- You're the criminal.
- That's it.

85
00:03:26,496 --> 00:03:27,456
I'm your father!

86
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:28,866
Your choice, not mine.

87
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:31,613
- Hey, I'm gonna be your father
- come on. Let's go.

88
00:03:31,648 --> 00:03:33,975
Whether you like
what I teach you or not!

89
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,055
Let's go. Come on.

90
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,540
Let's go. Let's go.

91
00:03:38,575 --> 00:03:40,086
God damn it.

92
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:41,439
Hello!

93
00:03:47,045 --> 00:03:49,935
- Rezian's safe house.
- I see that.

94
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,380
It went up in smoke early
this morning... two bodies.

95
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,899
- Rezian?
- Both too crispy to I. D.

96
00:03:56,724 --> 00:03:58,510
I'm guessing
it's Pezuela's boys

97
00:03:58,545 --> 00:04:00,590
hunting
for the blackmail box.

98
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,548
Means they're still convinced
the armenians have their intel.

99
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,665
If that is Rezian
laying in there,??

100
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,851
That know
about our money-train debt.

101
00:04:06,886 --> 00:04:09,070
Our deal
was with Rezian.

102
00:04:09,105 --> 00:04:12,591
Him being dead might put us
back to square one.

103
00:04:18,126 --> 00:04:20,441
Mmm, s'mores.

104
00:04:20,476 --> 00:04:21,984
The arson unit
weigh in yet?

105
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,595
It didn't have to. The killers
left gasoline cans behind.

106
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,735
Weren't even trying
to hide it.

107
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,276
Recovered
9mm shells,

108
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:28,636
bullet holes
in their skulls.

109
00:04:28,671 --> 00:04:32,102
Today's the city march
observing the Armenian genocide.

110
00:04:32,137 --> 00:04:34,300
The block's in the middle
of a red, blue, and orange sea.

111
00:04:34,335 --> 00:04:36,865
Whole area's gonna be
swarming with people.

112
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:40,883
Strange day
for an internal beef.

113
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:43,622
The armenians make
any recent enemies?

114
00:04:43,872 --> 00:04:45,688
I heard some talk
the Mexicans

115
00:04:45,723 --> 00:04:47,276
have been stirring
things up with them lately.

116
00:04:47,311 --> 00:04:48,191
Could just
be street chatter.

117
00:04:48,226 --> 00:04:50,070
If this is the first shot
in a war,

118
00:04:50,105 --> 00:04:52,333
I don't want
the Armenian day of remembrance

119
00:04:52,368 --> 00:04:54,312
being turned
into a fresh battle.

120
00:04:54,347 --> 00:04:58,316
Well, maybe shane's playdates
with Ellis Rezian can pay off again.

121
00:04:58,443 --> 00:05:00,757
We'll track him down,
get him to I. D. The bodies.

122
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:02,657
See you guys
back at the Barn.

123
00:05:03,945 --> 00:05:06,093
Rezian gone might not
be the worst thing.

124
00:05:06,128 --> 00:05:08,366
Cut off the head,
and the tentacles get frisky.

125
00:05:08,401 --> 00:05:09,023
It's a risk.

126
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,207
Iook, just hear me out.

127
00:05:10,242 --> 00:05:13,510
Let's find out if he's alive
first, all right?

128
00:05:18,256 --> 00:05:19,477
It's okay.

129
00:05:19,512 --> 00:05:20,752
Glad to see you upright.

130
00:05:23,635 --> 00:05:25,230
If I hadn't gotten out of there
last night...

131
00:05:25,265 --> 00:05:26,461
don't worry.
You already thanked me.

132
00:05:26,496 --> 00:05:28,744
Two of my lieutenants
are dead.

133
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:30,554
And this was the Mexicans?

134
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:31,905
They couldn't kill you
in jail.

135
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,421
Why did you think
they would stop on the outside?

136
00:05:33,456 --> 00:05:35,074
What do they want?

137
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,624
Some Mexican intel
went missing.

138
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:43,150
Whatever it was, it was valuable
enough to spark a war.

139
00:05:43,185 --> 00:05:45,158
Your two burned
lieutenants will vouch for that.

140
00:05:45,193 --> 00:05:46,288
If you've heard the rumors,

141
00:05:46,323 --> 00:05:48,088
you can find
their source, right?

142
00:05:50,595 --> 00:05:52,094
I want a sit-down

143
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:55,781
with the people who burned
my store and killed my men.

144
00:05:55,816 --> 00:05:58,630
My people are dead
because the Mexicans are wrong.

145
00:05:58,665 --> 00:06:01,266
I'll talk to them,
make them understand that.

146
00:06:01,301 --> 00:06:04,293
They shanked you.
They killed your guys.

147
00:06:04,328 --> 00:06:06,540
Now you want to pencil in
some kind of circle jerk?

148
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,371
The only way to respond
is to push back.

149
00:06:08,406 --> 00:06:09,895
The Mexicans
are too powerful.

150
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:12,415
We can't compete
against their numbers.

151
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,206
You think them realizing
the armos don't have the balls

152
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,039
to fight back
is gonna lead to peace?

153
00:06:17,074 --> 00:06:19,334
The Mexicans
will smell your weakness,

154
00:06:19,434 --> 00:06:20,444
and they'll pounce on it.

155
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,862
We don't have
their missing intel.

156
00:06:22,897 --> 00:06:23,687
When they know that,

157
00:06:23,722 --> 00:06:26,196
they'll go looking for it
someplace else.

158
00:06:32,186 --> 00:06:33,773
If I pull this off,

159
00:06:33,808 --> 00:06:36,485
it's number two
on your short list of favors.

160
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,795
One more, me and my family
are all paid up.

161
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,368
As long
as the meeting happens

162
00:06:41,403 --> 00:06:44,707
before any more
Armenian blood is shed.

163
00:06:47,753 --> 00:06:49,759
It's time to end this war
we started.

164
00:06:49,794 --> 00:06:51,005
Can't do that yet.

165
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,941
We got the list
of Rezian's inner circle,

166
00:06:52,976 --> 00:06:54,740
which just grew smaller
by two.

167
00:06:54,775 --> 00:06:57,267
That's time
to finish this job

168
00:06:57,302 --> 00:06:59,647
while we can still control
the casualties.

169
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:06,398
Iook, I know
that you are not thinking

170
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:08,234
about setting up
this meeting.

171
00:07:08,301 --> 00:07:10,431
I'm thinking about
setting up this meeting.

172
00:07:10,466 --> 00:07:12,483
Is this another one
of those surprise endings

173
00:07:12,518 --> 00:07:14,713
that you're gonna lay on me
after all this is over with?

174
00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:18,255
Rezian isn't the only one we
have to think about taking down.

175
00:07:18,907 --> 00:07:21,903
I'm... I'm targeting
Cruz Pezuela.

176
00:07:21,938 --> 00:07:24,018
Aceveda's one-man
campaign bankroll?

177
00:07:24,053 --> 00:07:26,729
He's buying up Farmington
with cartel money.

178
00:07:26,764 --> 00:07:27,936
Pezuela gets his way,

179
00:07:27,971 --> 00:07:31,297
the entire district will be
byz lat-owned and -operated.

180
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:32,621
Well,
how is that our problem?

181
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:41,426
It's big-picture time,
Matt.

182
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,754
They're trying to take my badge,
and I need an endgame.

183
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:46,598
Pezuela is the cherry
on my career sundae.

184
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,516
Why does that
have to involve Rezian?

185
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,876
The only way to connect
Pezuela to the cartel

186
00:07:50,911 --> 00:07:53,895
is to force him
into making a bad mistake.

187
00:07:54,631 --> 00:07:58,657
The intel in that box
belongs to him.

188
00:08:00,223 --> 00:08:02,430
Now, if Pezuela gets desperate
enough to get it back,

189
00:08:02,465 --> 00:08:04,851
he shoots his way
into a jail cell

190
00:08:04,886 --> 00:08:07,434
and wipes out
the Armenian threat for us...

191
00:08:07,818 --> 00:08:09,076
two for one.

192
00:08:09,111 --> 00:08:11,451
What happens
when Pezuela doesn't cooperate

193
00:08:11,486 --> 00:08:13,976
and we're forced
to choose one win?

194
00:08:14,463 --> 00:08:15,887
Not there yet.

195
00:08:16,594 --> 00:08:20,164
Sync: Vine

196
00:08:26,864 --> 00:08:29,177
Rezian wants to sit down
with the Mexican brains.

197
00:08:29,212 --> 00:08:31,373
Guess he got
your smoke signals.

198
00:08:31,408 --> 00:08:33,638
And he's willing
to make a deal.

199
00:08:33,673 --> 00:08:37,120
I'm not paying anyone
to give me back my property.

200
00:08:37,155 --> 00:08:38,561
I'm paying you to get it.

201
00:08:38,596 --> 00:08:41,376
I'm giving you a chance
to get your blackmail box.

202
00:08:41,411 --> 00:08:43,353
That's what
you're paying me for.

203
00:08:43,388 --> 00:08:44,691
That doesn't interest you,

204
00:08:44,726 --> 00:08:47,104
I'm sure Rezian will be content
to hold onto it,

205
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:49,599
do with it
as he sees fit.

206
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,189
Or you could try to
burn your way

207
00:08:51,224 --> 00:08:52,950
through the rest
of east Hollywood.

208
00:08:55,026 --> 00:08:56,921
This might be
the smarter move.

209
00:08:56,956 --> 00:08:58,131
I'll set it up.

210
00:08:58,453 --> 00:09:00,393
But they want to talk
to the brains.

211
00:09:00,428 --> 00:09:03,220
I am not walking into the belly
of the Armenian beast

212
00:09:03,255 --> 00:09:06,683
with one of your day laborers
as my date.

213
00:09:11,069 --> 00:09:13,127
<I>Okay.
Hoy más tarde te llamo.

214
00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:17,151
Detective Mackey,
amando rios.

215
00:09:17,186 --> 00:09:19,017
Amando will speak
for me.

216
00:09:19,324 --> 00:09:20,949
Not sure he'll pass
for brains.

217
00:09:20,984 --> 00:09:22,846
He's less tequila-soaked
than the rest of the crew

218
00:09:22,881 --> 00:09:24,519
I've seen
circling you lately.

219
00:09:24,554 --> 00:09:26,034
There's only
one condition.

220
00:09:26,069 --> 00:09:29,488
If they don't bring the box
to this meeting, every file,

221
00:09:29,523 --> 00:09:31,334
tell them
not to come at all.

222
00:09:31,369 --> 00:09:33,097
- Fair enough.
- What meeting?

223
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,688
I'll explain it all

224
00:09:34,723 --> 00:09:38,247
as soon as detective Mackey gets
back to us with the details.

225
00:09:40,596 --> 00:09:42,432
Rios isn't
just some beaner.

226
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:44,385
He's got a face
only a cartel could love.

227
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,057
I got Julien
looking into him now.

228
00:09:46,092 --> 00:09:47,371
What do I tell Rezian?

229
00:09:47,406 --> 00:09:49,114
Tell him the truth.

230
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:50,858
Pezuela's
not sending his boy

231
00:09:50,893 --> 00:09:53,041
unless he knows
the blackmail box is waiting.

232
00:09:53,076 --> 00:09:54,875
So, the meet-and-greet
doesn't even happen.

233
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,981
We look like we did our job
for both sides.

234
00:09:57,016 --> 00:09:59,047
They stay clueless
and at war.

235
00:09:59,082 --> 00:10:00,370
According to the computer,

236
00:10:00,405 --> 00:10:02,893
amando rios is a nonperson,
at least stateside.

237
00:10:02,928 --> 00:10:04,816
He's one
of the arsonists?

238
00:10:05,243 --> 00:10:06,778
Well, it's possible.

239
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:10,130
Tipster thinks he might be
hooked up with a Mexican cartel.

240
00:10:10,165 --> 00:10:12,506
That's a world bigger
than what our database covers.

241
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,706
Then you might need
to dig a little deeper.

242
00:10:15,277 --> 00:10:17,652
Well, I'll try and find
a bigger shovel.

243
00:10:19,867 --> 00:10:23,163
You got to love that first-year
strike team enthusiasm.

244
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,785
Keep an eye on Julien...
information we need...

245
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,141
but if rios gets picked up
or spooked,

246
00:10:29,176 --> 00:10:30,904
we lose our best shot
at Pezuela.

247
00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:32,187
There shouldn't be any trace
of his location

248
00:10:32,222 --> 00:10:34,378
under any rocks
that Julien can reach.

249
00:10:39,612 --> 00:10:41,644
<I>Hey, you called me.

250
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:44,029
I don't need anyone
mixing martinis,

251
00:10:44,064 --> 00:10:47,337
but I'd like a little credit for
braving the morning gridlock.

252
00:10:48,354 --> 00:10:50,146
Ah,
give us a minute.

253
00:10:50,181 --> 00:10:51,396
Thanks for coming.

254
00:10:51,431 --> 00:10:52,711
You sounded like
you needed a favor.

255
00:10:52,746 --> 00:10:54,199
And you're more than due.

256
00:10:54,234 --> 00:10:58,781
We Drew the short straw
on this morning's

257
00:10:58,816 --> 00:11:00,831
burning deaths
in little Armenia.

258
00:11:00,866 --> 00:11:02,361
You're the one
with the well-appointed list

259
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:03,724
of east Hollywood c. I. S.

260
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,457
I've got Julien
after a suspect,

261
00:11:06,492 --> 00:11:09,624
but our arms might not be
long enough to reach him.

262
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:11,496
Give me a name,
and I'll run with it.

263
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:12,546
Amando rios.

264
00:11:12,581 --> 00:11:15,482
If he's our guy, we want
in on him sooner than later.

265
00:11:15,517 --> 00:11:16,634
Never heard of him.

266
00:11:16,997 --> 00:11:18,692
Let me plug it
into our system.

267
00:11:18,727 --> 00:11:20,923
I'll try to get back to you
within the hour.

268
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,808
Victim used a crowbar
to break in.

269
00:11:26,843 --> 00:11:29,139
Teenage resident
Lloyd denton called it in.

270
00:11:29,174 --> 00:11:30,859
He's our shooter.

271
00:11:30,894 --> 00:11:32,706
All right.
What are you doing out here?

272
00:11:32,741 --> 00:11:34,370
I'm riding
with Hanlon today...

273
00:11:34,405 --> 00:11:36,273
mandated
monthly street duty.

274
00:11:36,308 --> 00:11:37,857
No I. D. On the victim.

275
00:11:37,892 --> 00:11:40,601
Denton was home alone,
heard the glass break.

276
00:11:40,636 --> 00:11:42,201
Family's got a gun
in the house.

277
00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:43,551
Anybody talk
to the boy yet?

278
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:45,662
He isn't saying much.
He's pretty freaked out.

279
00:11:45,697 --> 00:11:47,950
Little Armenia torch job

280
00:11:47,985 --> 00:11:50,334
makes it a busy day
to be out of the Barn.

281
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:51,766
I'm checking in.

282
00:11:51,801 --> 00:11:53,511
I figured if I waited
for the right time,

283
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,366
I'd never get these
street hours done.

284
00:11:55,401 --> 00:11:57,623
The assistant Chief won't make
an exception in your case?

285
00:11:57,658 --> 00:11:58,690
I didn't ask him to.

286
00:11:58,725 --> 00:12:00,932
Phillips is aware
of your condition.

287
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:04,107
He also knows that it doesn't
affect my job performance.

288
00:12:04,142 --> 00:12:06,826
Well, it looks like
a straight-up b&E.

289
00:12:06,861 --> 00:12:09,511
We need a parent present
to take the kid's statement.

290
00:12:09,546 --> 00:12:10,763
Father's not
in the picture,

291
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:12,559
but we got a call in
to the mother at work.

292
00:12:12,594 --> 00:12:14,558
Got this?
We need to roll.

293
00:12:14,593 --> 00:12:17,553
Yeah.
Take care out there.

294
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:20,786
Would it have killed her
to wear blues?

295
00:12:24,418 --> 00:12:25,777
Thanks.

296
00:12:27,235 --> 00:12:30,302
Hey, Lloyd. Um,
I'm detective Wagenbach.

297
00:12:30,337 --> 00:12:31,854
This is
detective Billings.

298
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:34,073
We're gonna have an officer
take you down to the station.

299
00:12:34,108 --> 00:12:35,707
Your mom's
gonna meet us there.

300
00:12:35,742 --> 00:12:39,794
Why would luis
break into our house?

301
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:41,078
You knew the victim?

302
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:47,404
Yeah, we go
to the same high school.

303
00:12:55,618 --> 00:12:57,934
You and Hanlon
out there cracking skulls?

304
00:12:57,969 --> 00:12:58,811
Hey, don't be too rough.

305
00:12:58,846 --> 00:13:00,444
Captain likes things
by the book.

306
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,366
I asked Julien
for a status report.

307
00:13:02,401 --> 00:13:04,946
Amando rios?
Sounds Mexican to my ears.

308
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:07,236
Rios is one of the names
that dropped,

309
00:13:07,271 --> 00:13:09,420
but I wouldn't count on it
turning into something.

310
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,431
Shane,
you track down Rezian?

311
00:13:13,142 --> 00:13:15,088
Crispies are two
of his mob lieutenants,

312
00:13:15,123 --> 00:13:17,048
matavian and bozian.

313
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,225
He shed light
on any Mexican trouble?

314
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,769
He's as in the dark
as we are.

315
00:13:20,804 --> 00:13:22,616
He can't strike back
without a target.

316
00:13:22,651 --> 00:13:26,159
Ask Olivia. Maybe the feds can
point us in rios' direction.

317
00:13:26,194 --> 00:13:27,724
Already on it.

318
00:13:31,309 --> 00:13:34,419
Tina, find me when you get through
the paperwork on this guy.

319
00:13:34,952 --> 00:13:37,653
The denton kid's up in 1,
and that's the mom.

320
00:13:37,688 --> 00:13:39,514
Thanks.

321
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:43,629
Mrs. Denton,
I'm detective Wagenbach.

322
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:46,507
That boy broke in.

323
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:49,043
I know that Lloyd
was only defending himself.

324
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,029
He shouldn't be
in any kind of trouble.

325
00:13:51,418 --> 00:13:53,301
We just need your son
to tell us what happened.

326
00:13:53,336 --> 00:13:55,423
He'll be free to go, okay?

327
00:13:55,727 --> 00:13:57,654
I was in the bedroom,
doing my homework,

328
00:13:57,689 --> 00:13:59,551
when I heard the glass break.

329
00:13:59,586 --> 00:14:02,465
When did you realize
the intruder was luis?

330
00:14:03,648 --> 00:14:05,189
Not until after.

331
00:14:05,849 --> 00:14:10,123
I heard someone come in,
and I went to my mom's room.

332
00:14:10,158 --> 00:14:10,959
To get the revolver?

333
00:14:10,994 --> 00:14:14,073
I could hide until whoever
it was took what they wanted,

334
00:14:14,108 --> 00:14:18,496
but he kept coming closer,
so I got the gun.

335
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,735
The neighborhood's all we could
afford since Lloyd's dad left,

336
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,150
so I got that gun
for protection.

337
00:14:25,815 --> 00:14:27,364
Ever been fired
before now?

338
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,758
Only at the range.

339
00:14:28,793 --> 00:14:30,311
I wanted Lloyd
to understand

340
00:14:30,346 --> 00:14:32,287
that a gun is
a big responsibility,

341
00:14:32,322 --> 00:14:35,010
so we both
took safety classes.

342
00:14:35,377 --> 00:14:37,881
Do you and luis
know each other well?

343
00:14:38,471 --> 00:14:40,456
I don't even think
he knew my name.

344
00:14:40,491 --> 00:14:44,185
I mean, we don't hang out
with the same people,

345
00:14:44,886 --> 00:14:46,869
you know,
his friend diego

346
00:14:46,904 --> 00:14:50,997
gave everyone a hard time,
so I just tried to stay away.

347
00:14:55,998 --> 00:14:57,833
Why did he try to break
into our house?

348
00:14:57,868 --> 00:15:02,024
I never did anything
to that kid, mom, I swear.

349
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:04,601
Honey,
it isn't your fault.

350
00:15:06,504 --> 00:15:09,710
Yeah, but he's dead
because of me.

351
00:15:09,745 --> 00:15:12,341
How much longer
does he have to do this?

352
00:15:14,424 --> 00:15:16,662
Uh...
we'll have more questions.

353
00:15:16,697 --> 00:15:18,584
Why don't you two
get a bite,

354
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:21,134
take a little time alone together?
The rest can wait.

355
00:15:22,478 --> 00:15:25,303
Kid seemed pretty busted up.
He had answers for everything.

356
00:15:25,338 --> 00:15:28,840
Yeah, whole scene played out
like the perfect interrogation.

357
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:29,631
One thing I've learned

358
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:32,221
from that Sack of conspiracy
theories you call a head...

359
00:15:32,256 --> 00:15:35,540
the Wagenbach freak meter
points to red, you listen.

360
00:15:36,488 --> 00:15:37,516
School bully's dead,

361
00:15:37,551 --> 00:15:39,196
picked-on kid
did the shooting.

362
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:40,658
Let's grab up
the friend diego,

363
00:15:40,693 --> 00:15:43,158
get a read
on the locker-room history.

364
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:49,361
Can I come in?

365
00:15:49,396 --> 00:15:51,592
Uh, okay.

366
00:15:55,075 --> 00:15:56,523
Where's the baby?

367
00:15:57,474 --> 00:15:59,677
He's asleep.
I just put him down.

368
00:15:59,712 --> 00:16:01,164
Do your parents
know you're here?

369
00:16:01,656 --> 00:16:03,035
Yeah.

370
00:16:04,647 --> 00:16:07,356
Who does he look like now,
you or my dad?

371
00:16:09,283 --> 00:16:11,143
Honey, this is
a little unexpected.

372
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,411
What is it
that you want?

373
00:16:12,446 --> 00:16:14,811
To talk to you
about my dad.

374
00:16:17,491 --> 00:16:18,230
Okay.

375
00:16:18,265 --> 00:16:20,285
I've read stuff online
about his job.

376
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:22,841
People think
that he's stolen things,

377
00:16:22,876 --> 00:16:24,399
he's hurt people,
he's broken the law.

378
00:16:24,434 --> 00:16:25,943
Honey,
he's your father.

379
00:16:25,978 --> 00:16:29,226
Do you think he killed
Terry Crowley?

380
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:34,885
No.

381
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,264
That's what lieutenant
Jon Kavanaugh thought.

382
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:40,606
I really think
you should just be

383
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:42,670
thinking about school
and things like that.

384
00:16:42,705 --> 00:16:44,335
I need to know
who he really is.

385
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,521
<I>Well,
then, talk to him.

386
00:16:45,556 --> 00:16:48,723
Is he helping you raise Lee?
Does he even give you money?

387
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,866
I haven't asked him to.

388
00:16:50,901 --> 00:16:52,850
I don't blame you.

389
00:16:52,885 --> 00:16:54,236
Cassidy, you should go.

390
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,553
I am not the person

391
00:16:55,588 --> 00:16:57,416
you should be having
this conversation with.

392
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:58,948
You have no reason
to defend him.

393
00:16:58,983 --> 00:17:00,982
He gets you pregnant,
and then he dumps you.

394
00:17:01,017 --> 00:17:03,086
Who does that?

395
00:17:06,927 --> 00:17:08,627
Just wait.
I'll be right back.

396
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:10,625
Just
wait right here.

397
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:14,800
Vic!

398
00:17:15,436 --> 00:17:17,488
Hey, you weren't kidding
about the turnaround.

399
00:17:17,523 --> 00:17:19,752
Rios' name didn't turn up
anything on our end.

400
00:17:19,787 --> 00:17:21,350
I'm sorry.

401
00:17:21,385 --> 00:17:23,550
Eh, long shot.

402
00:17:23,947 --> 00:17:24,565
What makes you think

403
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,375
this guy might be tied
to the armo deaths?

404
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,279
Hunch.

405
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:30,468
Got to exhaust all my resources,
and lately that means you.

406
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,152
Not every day a girl's called
a resource.

407
00:17:33,187 --> 00:17:34,952
I'll keep an eye out
for rios.

408
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:38,350
And if you hear anything
on your end, give me a shout.

409
00:17:38,385 --> 00:17:39,990
Thanks.

410
00:17:40,658 --> 00:17:42,861
If rios isn't tracking
on their radar,

411
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,413
he might not be the cartel key
we're looking for.

412
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,967
Doesn't mean he's not here
to do their dirty work.

413
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:49,694
Just means
he hasn't been caught yet.

414
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:51,459
What do we do
about Rezian?

415
00:17:51,963 --> 00:17:54,117
Time to give him
the bad news.

416
00:17:58,257 --> 00:18:00,249
We tossed your olive branch
to the Mexicans.

417
00:18:00,284 --> 00:18:01,962
They're not interested
in a sit-down

418
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,243
unless you can produce
their missing box of intel.

419
00:18:04,278 --> 00:18:06,580
Time to
make another wish.

420
00:18:07,552 --> 00:18:09,180
Set up the meeting.

421
00:18:10,487 --> 00:18:12,002
I just told you.

422
00:18:12,442 --> 00:18:14,667
They won't agree to the meet
unless you have the goods.

423
00:18:14,702 --> 00:18:15,709
What is it
you're not hearing?

424
00:18:15,744 --> 00:18:17,604
I have what they want.

425
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:20,195
I'm prepared
to give it back to them.

426
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,597
You were crying to us
this morning

427
00:18:21,632 --> 00:18:23,591
that you didn't even know what
the hell they were looking for.

428
00:18:23,626 --> 00:18:24,498
And now you've got it?

429
00:18:24,533 --> 00:18:25,817
What is it
you're not hearing?

430
00:18:25,852 --> 00:18:28,501
You've had this mexi intel
the whole time?

431
00:18:28,536 --> 00:18:30,401
We located it
a couple of hours ago.

432
00:18:30,436 --> 00:18:33,691
We're not walking into a Mexican
hat dance without a ticket.

433
00:18:33,726 --> 00:18:35,531
This information...

434
00:18:36,487 --> 00:18:38,850
what does it say
that's so valuable to them?

435
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:40,519
You're here
to repay your debt.

436
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:42,360
The rest
is none of your concern.

437
00:18:43,001 --> 00:18:44,984
Set up the meeting.

438
00:18:48,915 --> 00:18:49,935
He's bigger.

439
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,382
Yeah.

440
00:18:58,184 --> 00:19:00,803
You're supposed to be at school,
taking that make-up quiz.

441
00:19:00,838 --> 00:19:02,343
What are your grades
gonna be now?

442
00:19:02,378 --> 00:19:04,555
If you didn't ground me,
I wouldn't have to sneak out.

443
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,002
Let's go, right now.

444
00:19:06,037 --> 00:19:06,956
Let go of me!

445
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:08,924
We are going home now!

446
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,396
- My backpack's in the other room.
- Then go get it.

447
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:23,822
Thanks for calling me.

448
00:19:23,857 --> 00:19:27,474
Hey, it's just a preview of what
I have to look forward to.

449
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:31,865
She was asking a lot
of questions about Vic.

450
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,082
- How did you answer them?
- It's not my place.

451
00:19:34,714 --> 00:19:36,288
She's pretty angry,
though.

452
00:19:36,323 --> 00:19:37,984
I think we all are.

453
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:42,951
We talked to luis' friend
diego vargas.

454
00:19:42,986 --> 00:19:45,485
They were selling drugs
at school, came up short,

455
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,973
had a need
for some fast cash.

456
00:19:47,008 --> 00:19:49,549
So, then, it all makes sense
why this kid broke in.

457
00:19:49,584 --> 00:19:50,809
Yeah.

458
00:19:52,477 --> 00:19:54,249
Iloyd, did you say
something to luis

459
00:19:54,284 --> 00:19:58,487
about money, jewelry, something
like that in your house?

460
00:19:58,939 --> 00:20:00,166
No.

461
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,673
I told you, it's not like
we really ever spoke.

462
00:20:04,108 --> 00:20:05,840
Anybody at school
know your schedule,

463
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,100
that your mom worked
a lot?

464
00:20:07,135 --> 00:20:10,475
Maybe. I mean,
I don't think so, but maybe.

465
00:20:11,232 --> 00:20:13,866
And you didn't realize
it was luis when you shot him?

466
00:20:13,901 --> 00:20:16,100
He already told you that.

467
00:20:16,135 --> 00:20:17,997
So, when did you recognize
who it was?

468
00:20:19,592 --> 00:20:21,207
When I walked over
to the body.

469
00:20:21,242 --> 00:20:24,612
- How long before you called 911?
- Right that second.

470
00:20:24,647 --> 00:20:26,203
Must have
been upsetting...

471
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,115
all that blood.

472
00:20:30,502 --> 00:20:32,197
Iook, can I go now?

473
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,564
I've answered all your questions
a bunch of times.

474
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,754
Diego said
luis was pretty sure

475
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:43,784
he was gonna find $1,000 in cash
somewhere in your house.

476
00:20:45,337 --> 00:20:46,978
The most expensive thing
we own

477
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:50,440
is a 25-inch color TV,
detective.

478
00:20:50,475 --> 00:20:52,727
This guy's all I've got.

479
00:20:56,747 --> 00:20:58,878
Mrs. Denton,
we're concerned about your son.

480
00:20:58,913 --> 00:21:01,541
Case lines up,
shooting's obviously clean.

481
00:21:01,576 --> 00:21:02,964
Normally,
we send you home.

482
00:21:02,999 --> 00:21:05,531
But crime victims sustain
a lot of mental trauma.

483
00:21:05,566 --> 00:21:07,307
Given his age,
I'm worried that Lloyd

484
00:21:07,342 --> 00:21:09,374
doesn't have the tools
to deal with this emotionally,

485
00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:11,110
especially with
no father around.

486
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:12,876
He's been through
so much already.

487
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:14,715
Must be hard raising him
on your own.

488
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,876
I'm doing my best.

489
00:21:15,911 --> 00:21:18,127
I keep riding him
about doing his schoolwork

490
00:21:18,162 --> 00:21:19,962
and the importance
of a good education.

491
00:21:19,997 --> 00:21:20,947
I never got to college.

492
00:21:20,982 --> 00:21:22,532
How's he doing,
grade-wise?

493
00:21:22,567 --> 00:21:25,603
His teachers say
he won't apply himself.

494
00:21:25,638 --> 00:21:28,570
He won't do his homework,
but then he aces his tests.

495
00:21:28,605 --> 00:21:30,324
But he averages out
to a "c."

496
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:32,452
It's common for kids
with really high I. Q. S.

497
00:21:32,487 --> 00:21:35,635
Iloyd said he was doing his
homework when luis broke in.

498
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,432
Yeah, I guess he finally
started listening to me.

499
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,933
Would you mind
if I stayed in touch?

500
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:44,142
I want to make sure that Lloyd
gets all the help he needs.

501
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:46,447
Yes, of course.

502
00:21:47,499 --> 00:21:48,757
Great.

503
00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:52,321
We know Rezian's lying
about the box,

504
00:21:52,356 --> 00:21:54,152
so we can't anticipate
his next move.

505
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,792
We got to be ready
for anything.

506
00:21:55,827 --> 00:21:58,551
He's probably using us
to prep a shoot-out.

507
00:21:58,586 --> 00:21:59,966
What are the specs
on this place?

508
00:22:00,001 --> 00:22:02,070
No surveillance,
two points of entry.

509
00:22:02,105 --> 00:22:04,452
Means I can back you up
from out here.

510
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:06,238
Get in touch with Rezian.

511
00:22:06,273 --> 00:22:08,198
Tell him three men only...
no weapons.

512
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:10,878
You've been playing both sides.
How are you gonna pull this off?

513
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:12,365
I got to stay
as neutral as possible,

514
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,320
which means if shit goes
sideways, you got to contain it.

515
00:22:15,355 --> 00:22:16,894
No problem.

516
00:22:17,247 --> 00:22:19,863
At least we're all three
together on this one.

517
00:22:19,898 --> 00:22:20,965
Yeah.

518
00:22:21,981 --> 00:22:24,644
You show me a better way,
I'll take it.

519
00:22:27,578 --> 00:22:30,717
He's got a location
on Pezuela's lapdog, rios,

520
00:22:30,752 --> 00:22:32,020
wants us
to meet him there.

521
00:22:32,055 --> 00:22:34,386
How is that possible
when Olivia came up empty?

522
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:38,234
Guess the enthusiastic supercop
turned over the right rock.

523
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:39,651
Picking up rios
means there's no meeting,

524
00:22:39,686 --> 00:22:41,466
buys us some time to figure out
what's Rezian's playing.

525
00:22:41,501 --> 00:22:43,560
Being the arresting officer
screws Vic with Pezuela.

526
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:46,991
We got to lock up Julien
so he doesn't blow our plan.

527
00:22:47,272 --> 00:22:48,356
Let's go.

528
00:22:54,949 --> 00:22:56,490
Friend of mine landed
at border patrol.

529
00:22:56,525 --> 00:22:58,553
Rios is on
their unofficial watch list.

530
00:22:58,588 --> 00:22:59,488
They're tracking him?

531
00:22:59,523 --> 00:23:00,788
They don't have
enough manpower to do that,

532
00:23:00,823 --> 00:23:04,003
but they do know that rios has
some family at this address.

533
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:07,652
Amazing work.

534
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:09,043
Just trying to chip in.

535
00:23:09,078 --> 00:23:12,265
Neighbor said they saw him go in
a couple hours ago.

536
00:23:13,046 --> 00:23:14,872
Me and Vic
will take the back.

537
00:23:25,778 --> 00:23:27,035
Police.

538
00:23:27,268 --> 00:23:29,133
Open up. We want
to ask you some questions.

539
00:23:29,168 --> 00:23:30,598
Police.
Open this door.

540
00:23:30,633 --> 00:23:33,135
Last chance.
Open this door.

541
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:35,239
- Police, open up!
- Go.

542
00:23:37,254 --> 00:23:38,356
Kitchen's clear.

543
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,669
- Bedroom, clear.
- Clear.

544
00:23:40,704 --> 00:23:43,509
The TV's on. Iooks like
we just missed someone.

545
00:23:43,544 --> 00:23:45,392
All right. Let's look around,

546
00:23:45,427 --> 00:23:48,401
see if there's any signs
of amando rios.

547
00:23:55,605 --> 00:23:57,619
So, we done talking
this Lloyd thing through?

548
00:23:57,654 --> 00:24:00,854
You spinning grassy knoll
doesn't do anything for us.

549
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:04,167
A profile...
male, highly intelligent,

550
00:24:04,202 --> 00:24:07,134
unstable family,
pisspoor student,

551
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:08,366
abandoned by his father.

552
00:24:08,401 --> 00:24:10,452
The mom's got
a big old Dutch-boy crush...

553
00:24:10,487 --> 00:24:13,036
obviously a couple
of genetic screws loose.

554
00:24:13,476 --> 00:24:14,700
The kid's off.

555
00:24:15,028 --> 00:24:18,839
All right, let's say he lures
the school bully over,

556
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,475
shoots him for payback
over some perceived slight?

557
00:24:22,005 --> 00:24:24,806
I don't get anger off Lloyd.
I get nothing.

558
00:24:24,841 --> 00:24:25,732
That's the problem.

559
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:27,372
He stood there
and watched somebody die

560
00:24:27,407 --> 00:24:29,259
like it was no big thing.

561
00:24:29,846 --> 00:24:31,426
There's speculation
bundy's first murders

562
00:24:31,461 --> 00:24:33,401
were committed
in his early teens.

563
00:24:33,817 --> 00:24:35,096
They gain reinforcement

564
00:24:35,131 --> 00:24:36,338
the more crimes
they get away with...

565
00:24:36,373 --> 00:24:38,261
gain power,
their methods improve.

566
00:24:38,296 --> 00:24:40,596
Wait a minute.
I buy the setup theory.

567
00:24:40,631 --> 00:24:43,532
But are you saying
this kid's a serial killer?

568
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,896
They all pop their cherry
somewhere.

569
00:24:46,681 --> 00:24:49,534
You know all
the rules, so let's play nice.

570
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,102
Once you've returned
your seat backs and tray tables

571
00:24:55,137 --> 00:24:57,238
to their upright position...

572
00:24:58,098 --> 00:25:00,717
then we'll be in business.

573
00:25:04,358 --> 00:25:06,594
Okay, we're all here.

574
00:25:07,722 --> 00:25:09,757
Who wants to share first?

575
00:25:11,512 --> 00:25:12,515
There's
a misunderstanding

576
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,743
that's causing
a lot of problems for us.

577
00:25:15,778 --> 00:25:17,642
Where's the box?

578
00:25:22,141 --> 00:25:23,865
We don't have it.

579
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,011
Oh, God damn it!
That's not what he told us!

580
00:25:26,046 --> 00:25:28,334
I only set this up because
you said you could deliver!

581
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:31,492
Your people stabbed me in jail,
killed two of my men today.

582
00:25:31,527 --> 00:25:33,532
You made your strength
very clear.

583
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:35,510
Everybody
just take a deep breath.

584
00:25:35,545 --> 00:25:37,883
- It has nothing to do with us.
- Step back.

585
00:25:37,918 --> 00:25:40,498
I risked coming empty-handed
because I want to prove

586
00:25:40,533 --> 00:25:43,313
the armenians have no stake
in this war.

587
00:25:43,348 --> 00:25:45,820
So, you tell me.
Who has what we want?

588
00:25:45,855 --> 00:25:48,486
I don't know how this rumor
got started,

589
00:25:48,521 --> 00:25:51,097
but I can't give you
what I don't have.

590
00:25:53,892 --> 00:25:54,966
We're businessmen.

591
00:25:55,001 --> 00:25:56,710
If you'll agree
to look someplace else,

592
00:25:56,745 --> 00:26:00,182
we're willing to let
today's murders go unanswered,

593
00:26:00,217 --> 00:26:03,817
and we'll help you find
who took what you lost.

594
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,495
Rezian's lying
through his Armenian teeth.

595
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,937
This is what he wants...
you doubting the truth.

596
00:26:18,972 --> 00:26:20,371
It clears him
for retribution.

597
00:26:20,406 --> 00:26:22,139
You sound desperate
to prove your worth.

598
00:26:22,174 --> 00:26:24,124
What good is a dirty cop
selling bad information?

599
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,162
My information
is still dead-on.

600
00:26:26,197 --> 00:26:28,741
You're the only one saying
the armenians have the box.

601
00:26:28,776 --> 00:26:30,391
And I've still never seen
any proof.

602
00:26:30,426 --> 00:26:32,559
One day, the blackmail box
goes missing.

603
00:26:32,594 --> 00:26:34,352
The next,
Rezian springs himself

604
00:26:34,387 --> 00:26:37,600
from a sure-thing tour
in county jail.

605
00:26:38,151 --> 00:26:40,806
Even you can connect
those dots.

606
00:26:40,841 --> 00:26:42,374
It's not enough.

607
00:26:42,409 --> 00:26:45,467
Maybe we need to look for it
somewhere else.

608
00:26:47,546 --> 00:26:49,786
A kid Lloyd's age
shouldn't have to deal

609
00:26:49,821 --> 00:26:52,137
with something this
potentially damaging alone.

610
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:55,248
Well, he's not alone,
detective.

611
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:58,127
I'm sorry.
Of course he's not.

612
00:26:58,695 --> 00:27:02,463
My dad died when I was
a little guy... 6 years old.

613
00:27:02,498 --> 00:27:04,335
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Long time ago...

614
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:06,681
the point is I know
what it's like to grow up

615
00:27:06,716 --> 00:27:08,599
without a man around
to relate to.

616
00:27:08,634 --> 00:27:11,624
Oh, Chuck wasn't
all that relatable

617
00:27:11,659 --> 00:27:13,750
even when he was
still with us.

618
00:27:13,785 --> 00:27:16,358
He drank... a lot.

619
00:27:18,981 --> 00:27:20,052
At my age,

620
00:27:20,087 --> 00:27:23,980
it's like a buyer's market
out there for men.

621
00:27:24,015 --> 00:27:27,880
I just never felt
the need to settle.

622
00:27:28,582 --> 00:27:30,741
A woman like you
shouldn't have to.

623
00:27:33,107 --> 00:27:34,445
Oh, detective Billings.

624
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,591
Are you sure
I can't get you some coffee?

625
00:27:36,626 --> 00:27:37,712
No, I'm good.

626
00:27:37,747 --> 00:27:39,806
But can you point me in
the direction of the restroom?

627
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:41,810
Oh, second door
on the left.

628
00:27:45,253 --> 00:27:48,564
I want you to know
that I'm here to help.

629
00:27:48,951 --> 00:27:50,065
House calls don't seem

630
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,770
like they're part of your
job description, detective.

631
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:54,730
I'm not the sort of cop
that punches out

632
00:27:54,765 --> 00:27:55,556
at the end
of eight hours.

633
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:58,093
And please, call me Dutch.

634
00:27:58,815 --> 00:28:00,099
Okay?

635
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:14,847
Does Lloyd have any friends
at school,

636
00:28:14,882 --> 00:28:16,945
someone he can talk to?

637
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,209
There aren't a lot
of white kids.

638
00:28:18,244 --> 00:28:19,944
Not that that matters.

639
00:28:19,979 --> 00:28:22,910
But with all the drugs
and gang activities,

640
00:28:22,945 --> 00:28:25,909
I always hoped that he would
just find himself a girlfriend.

641
00:28:26,542 --> 00:28:28,168
I mean,
he is a good-looking kid.

642
00:28:28,611 --> 00:28:30,697
I wasn't ready to date
until college.

643
00:28:30,732 --> 00:28:32,971
Some of us
are slow learners.

644
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,950
Rita,
it might be a good idea

645
00:28:35,985 --> 00:28:37,909
for you
to bring Lloyd back in.

646
00:28:37,944 --> 00:28:40,678
You want him to process this
in a healthy way.

647
00:28:40,713 --> 00:28:43,692
We can
submit the case file

648
00:28:43,727 --> 00:28:45,715
along with a videotape
of the interview,

649
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,847
maybe pry some money
out of the state

650
00:28:47,882 --> 00:28:49,814
to pay for some sessions
with a psychologist.

651
00:28:49,849 --> 00:28:52,463
Yeah, you know
how these bureaucrats are...

652
00:28:52,498 --> 00:28:55,411
all these hoops they want you
to jump through.

653
00:28:57,555 --> 00:29:01,670
<I>Well, if you think
it's the right thing.

654
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,053
- He's what?
- He's on his way in.

655
00:29:06,664 --> 00:29:09,548
From now on, if you need
to reach me, call.

656
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:11,471
We need a quick
Armenian political win...

657
00:29:11,506 --> 00:29:12,783
something public.

658
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:15,094
You help me with that,
I promise you,

659
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:17,927
the first domino falls
at Pezuela's feet.

660
00:29:19,314 --> 00:29:20,563
Why the armenians?

661
00:29:20,598 --> 00:29:21,770
Pezuela's
got it in his head

662
00:29:21,805 --> 00:29:24,253
that the armenians
have the blackmail box.

663
00:29:24,288 --> 00:29:27,723
We need him to continue
thinking that. That's all.

664
00:29:28,942 --> 00:29:30,185
It's our best shot

665
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:33,345
at getting Pezuela
to incriminate himself.

666
00:29:37,935 --> 00:29:40,326
Since the mayor recognized
the Armenian genocide,

667
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:43,912
the supporters have proposed
a commemorating memorial.

668
00:29:43,947 --> 00:29:44,786
Very nice.

669
00:29:44,821 --> 00:29:46,116
The funds have been
denied every year

670
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:48,575
by the same
city employee.

671
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:51,262
And Mr. Istanbul
with the tight fist,

672
00:29:51,297 --> 00:29:54,021
he's in
the blackmail box?

673
00:29:56,074 --> 00:29:59,328
I don't know that a plan
to erect some monument

674
00:29:59,363 --> 00:30:00,537
is enough
to ruffle feathers.

675
00:30:00,572 --> 00:30:03,971
It sounds small, but it'll
resonate big on the right ears.

676
00:30:04,006 --> 00:30:06,762
You give me the name,
I'll put it in play.

677
00:30:09,046 --> 00:30:10,598
You know him.

678
00:30:10,633 --> 00:30:14,820
It's the city controller...
Robert Martin.

679
00:30:20,477 --> 00:30:21,900
What's Pezuela got
on him?

680
00:30:21,935 --> 00:30:23,868
Insider trading.

681
00:30:24,838 --> 00:30:26,111
I was hoping to free him
from this noose,

682
00:30:26,146 --> 00:30:27,581
not tighten it myself.

683
00:30:27,616 --> 00:30:31,382
I'm not launching anything
that's gonna hurt your pal.

684
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:33,190
You're looking
at a long campaign.

685
00:30:33,926 --> 00:30:37,725
You better get used
to pressing the tough buttons.

686
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,354
Controller Martin,
please.

687
00:30:45,827 --> 00:30:47,089
I'm a friend
who's got information

688
00:30:47,124 --> 00:30:49,123
about his deal
with the berkeley group.

689
00:30:49,158 --> 00:30:52,395
- What?
- That's what he said.

690
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,778
Who is this?

691
00:30:53,813 --> 00:30:57,562
Insider trading is a crime.
You've been a bad boy.

692
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,089
I don't know
what you're talking about.

693
00:31:01,124 --> 00:31:02,137
Sure you do.

694
00:31:02,172 --> 00:31:04,493
Communications about the deal
you made so much money on,

695
00:31:04,528 --> 00:31:07,531
they've got a new owner,
and that owner's priorities

696
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:09,615
include protecting
Armenian interests.

697
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,560
Yeah, well,
that all sounds pretty vague.

698
00:31:11,595 --> 00:31:14,031
The only thing that would make
today's flag-waving sweeter

699
00:31:14,066 --> 00:31:16,095
is the announcement
that their ancestors

700
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,158
will be commemorated
in stone.

701
00:31:18,193 --> 00:31:21,159
The memorial? Oh, no, no, no.
It's too late for that.

702
00:31:21,194 --> 00:31:23,310
No, not when you've
got information

703
00:31:23,345 --> 00:31:24,529
that gives you
the inside track,

704
00:31:24,564 --> 00:31:27,031
just like you did
with berkeley.

705
00:31:29,189 --> 00:31:31,423
Guess you've got
some calls to make.

706
00:31:32,781 --> 00:31:34,679
I would have loved to have dealt
the blow myself.

707
00:31:34,714 --> 00:31:37,142
Asshole never did pay me back
for the favor he owes me.

708
00:31:37,177 --> 00:31:38,566
He would have known
your voice in a second.

709
00:31:38,601 --> 00:31:41,549
Now he's gonna
know my foot up his ass.

710
00:31:41,584 --> 00:31:42,629
Only question is

711
00:31:42,664 --> 00:31:45,663
how long is it gonna take
Pezuela to boil over?

712
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,293
City controller
announced plans

713
00:31:51,328 --> 00:31:54,749
for an I. A. Monument recognizing
the Armenian genocide.

714
00:31:54,784 --> 00:31:56,051
Well, so what?

715
00:31:56,086 --> 00:31:59,915
A slab of marble gonna disrupt
your vision for the city?

716
00:32:00,326 --> 00:32:01,235
Robert Martin

717
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,543
suddenly supporting
the Armenian interests

718
00:32:03,578 --> 00:32:05,614
means Rezian was lying.

719
00:32:05,649 --> 00:32:07,382
You were right.

720
00:32:07,417 --> 00:32:08,377
You really think Rezian

721
00:32:08,412 --> 00:32:10,215
would choose a monument
to show his hand?

722
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,519
It doesn't seem too smart.

723
00:32:12,554 --> 00:32:13,625
It's not.

724
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,818
But it means my information
has limited exposure.

725
00:32:16,853 --> 00:32:18,818
The plans will be presented
to the community

726
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,202
at the march
this afternoon.

727
00:32:20,237 --> 00:32:23,013
Rezian won't be able to resist
showing his face there.

728
00:32:23,048 --> 00:32:26,812
Hey, we agreed.
No civilian casualties.

729
00:32:26,847 --> 00:32:29,539
I see one gunman at that rally
in little Armenia,

730
00:32:29,574 --> 00:32:33,458
and you'll be hunting for
that blackmail box on your own.

731
00:32:33,941 --> 00:32:35,870
No Armenian civilians
will get hurt.

732
00:32:35,905 --> 00:32:36,742
Hey, wait.

733
00:32:36,777 --> 00:32:38,620
I'll find a way
to get it back to you.

734
00:32:38,655 --> 00:32:40,301
Do it quickly.

735
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:47,408
<I>Once you review
and sign your statement,

736
00:32:47,443 --> 00:32:49,472
<I>we'll be through.

737
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,479
You miss your dad?

738
00:32:58,442 --> 00:33:01,008
What there was to like
about him, I guess.

739
00:33:01,043 --> 00:33:02,602
<I>I hardly remember
my own father.

740
00:33:02,637 --> 00:33:05,732
Well,
I bet he would be proud.

741
00:33:06,411 --> 00:33:10,038
A detective seems like
a pretty honorable profession.

742
00:33:10,748 --> 00:33:12,504
We need another
signature downstairs,

743
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:15,505
Lloyd being a minor
and so forth.

744
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:29,229
This, uh...
this section here,

745
00:33:30,248 --> 00:33:33,034
where you were
when you heard luis break in...

746
00:33:33,069 --> 00:33:35,147
what were you doing,
again?

747
00:33:37,805 --> 00:33:41,289
Well, it says I was in
my bedroom, doing my homework.

748
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:43,336
Right.

749
00:33:45,348 --> 00:33:48,835
You have a lot of drawings
of yourself, don't you?

750
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:52,817
A lot of great artists
did self-portraits.

751
00:33:52,852 --> 00:33:55,920
You consider yourself
an artist?

752
00:33:55,955 --> 00:33:57,199
Not really.

753
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:00,750
I don't draw that well,
actually.

754
00:34:00,785 --> 00:34:04,852
A lot of things a person can do
to be considered an artist.

755
00:34:05,265 --> 00:34:06,964
- What subject?
- Hmm?

756
00:34:06,999 --> 00:34:08,563
What subject
were you studying

757
00:34:08,598 --> 00:34:10,426
when you heard luis
break in?

758
00:34:10,461 --> 00:34:11,028
Chem.

759
00:34:11,063 --> 00:34:13,476
Your mom says you don't
do very well in chemistry.

760
00:34:13,511 --> 00:34:15,644
Yeah, well,
I'm making an effort.

761
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,750
A couple of things,
looking over this statement,

762
00:34:18,785 --> 00:34:20,097
didn't quite
make sense to me.

763
00:34:20,132 --> 00:34:23,049
Are you sure this is exactly
how this all went down?

764
00:34:23,791 --> 00:34:25,497
That is
the whole truth, yes.

765
00:34:25,532 --> 00:34:28,567
Luis came looking for what
he thought was an easy payday,

766
00:34:28,602 --> 00:34:31,424
in broad daylight, with you
ready to defend yourself.

767
00:34:31,459 --> 00:34:33,128
I wasn't ready
for anything.

768
00:34:33,163 --> 00:34:35,492
Okay, I was writing
a chemistry lab report.

769
00:34:35,527 --> 00:34:37,446
I have it half-finished
if you'd like to see.

770
00:34:37,481 --> 00:34:38,374
You heard him break in,

771
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,542
went into your mom's room,
got the gun from her closet.

772
00:34:41,577 --> 00:34:43,125
You must have learned
always to keep

773
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,869
the gun unloaded
until you're ready to use it.

774
00:34:44,904 --> 00:34:48,635
So, you had time
to load the weapon

775
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,851
as you heard
the intruder approach?

776
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:52,885
It was adrenaline,
I guess.

777
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,988
You were nervous at this point,
hands shaking

778
00:34:55,023 --> 00:34:58,381
as you tried to put the bullets
in the chamber?

779
00:34:59,011 --> 00:35:00,284
I was scared, yeah.

780
00:35:00,319 --> 00:35:02,146
You didn't
see luis' face until...

781
00:35:02,181 --> 00:35:05,241
until I walked over
to his body.

782
00:35:09,548 --> 00:35:10,743
Iloyd...

783
00:35:12,518 --> 00:35:15,924
why is it, 10 hours
after killing someone,

784
00:35:16,677 --> 00:35:18,796
you seem past it?

785
00:35:21,557 --> 00:35:24,172
Just for shits
and giggles,

786
00:35:24,797 --> 00:35:26,814
let me tell you how I think
this might have gone down

787
00:35:26,849 --> 00:35:30,181
if it had been, say,
a murder.

788
00:35:30,216 --> 00:35:31,771
You could have gone
to luis yourself,

789
00:35:31,806 --> 00:35:34,210
told him about some theoretical
cash lying around your house.

790
00:35:34,245 --> 00:35:36,354
"You make it look like a
robbery. We'll split it 50/50."

791
00:35:36,389 --> 00:35:39,127
Only when
luis breaks in...

792
00:35:39,162 --> 00:35:41,535
you're waiting there
to kill him...

793
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:45,265
see what it feels like.

794
00:35:46,046 --> 00:35:48,889
A science experiment
you could ace...

795
00:35:52,515 --> 00:35:54,743
...stand over the body,

796
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:57,225
life draining out of him,

797
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,272
watch him die.

798
00:36:01,725 --> 00:36:03,904
Certain kind of person...

799
00:36:03,939 --> 00:36:07,205
might make you feel
like superman.

800
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,651
I was never big
on comic books.

801
00:36:26,661 --> 00:36:29,681
Go ahead and sign that statement
if you're satisfied.

802
00:36:32,222 --> 00:36:36,010
<I>You know, it's only natural,
a tragedy like this,

803
00:36:36,045 --> 00:36:39,118
for the person who walks away
to blame themselves.

804
00:36:41,848 --> 00:36:44,731
Promise me
you won't do that.

805
00:36:45,345 --> 00:36:47,381
<I>I'll try not to.

806
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:59,704
We're happy that the council
was able to support us on this.

807
00:36:59,739 --> 00:37:01,991
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

808
00:37:02,026 --> 00:37:02,911
David.

809
00:37:03,656 --> 00:37:06,158
Robert,
surprised to see you here.

810
00:37:06,193 --> 00:37:07,862
It's not the cause
I reject.

811
00:37:07,897 --> 00:37:10,229
It's the needless spending
on gratuitous events.

812
00:37:10,264 --> 00:37:13,217
Council was happy to hear
you had a change of heart.

813
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:15,629
You see anyone
eyeing Rezian?

814
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:18,444
I see a lot of ladies
who need some hot wax,

815
00:37:18,479 --> 00:37:19,549
but none of them Brown.

816
00:37:19,584 --> 00:37:22,044
Until this is over, Rezian
doesn't leave our sight line.

817
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,887
If a hit was ordered,

818
00:37:23,922 --> 00:37:25,358
it'll go down
before the speeches,

819
00:37:25,393 --> 00:37:27,809
when the crowd
is still unfocused.

820
00:37:30,561 --> 00:37:33,060
The Armenian cause deserves
as much representation

821
00:37:33,095 --> 00:37:34,612
as that of any other
ethnic group.

822
00:37:34,647 --> 00:37:36,043
Of course.

823
00:37:36,078 --> 00:37:38,210
This memorial is one
of the few times I can remember

824
00:37:38,245 --> 00:37:40,386
where we haven't seen
eye to eye.

825
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:42,475
Let's get started.

826
00:37:44,854 --> 00:37:46,633
Get down! Get down!

827
00:37:46,668 --> 00:37:48,432
Go! Go! Go! Go!

828
00:37:52,334 --> 00:37:54,511
Robert!
Robert! Oh, my God!

829
00:37:55,059 --> 00:37:56,701
I need a medic!

830
00:37:58,675 --> 00:38:00,351
I need a medic now!

831
00:38:11,178 --> 00:38:13,228
A city official is dead.

832
00:38:13,263 --> 00:38:15,043
Second crime
in little Armenia today,

833
00:38:15,078 --> 00:38:16,786
and we're still nowhere
on the first.

834
00:38:16,821 --> 00:38:19,422
This Armenian-Mexican trouble
is real.

835
00:38:19,457 --> 00:38:20,711
I'm still trying to
get a handle

836
00:38:20,746 --> 00:38:22,911
on how it started
and who's behind it.

837
00:38:22,946 --> 00:38:24,718
Then I want more
than just Julien

838
00:38:24,753 --> 00:38:27,688
in my Barn
with his nose to the ground.

839
00:38:33,467 --> 00:38:36,738
You and me, we're done!
Keep your money!

840
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:38,332
There's an important place
for you in my business.

841
00:38:38,367 --> 00:38:40,475
That was
a goddamn assassination.

842
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:42,906
Martin had nothing to do
with your Armenian beef.

843
00:38:42,941 --> 00:38:45,274
You flipped the switch on him
to send a message...

844
00:38:45,309 --> 00:38:48,896
"you use the blackmail box,
these are the consequences."

845
00:38:48,931 --> 00:38:53,255
We had a deal, man.
Contain the violence.

846
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,935
And I'm still
a goddamn cop!

847
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:56,502
Not for long.

848
00:38:57,381 --> 00:38:59,569
And not without me.

849
00:39:03,321 --> 00:39:05,620
You better pray
this doesn't blow back on you.

850
00:39:05,655 --> 00:39:07,391
That's what
I have you for.

851
00:39:12,053 --> 00:39:15,207
Between the fire you set
and the controller's murder,

852
00:39:15,242 --> 00:39:17,959
you have started one hell
of a shit storm for us.

853
00:39:17,994 --> 00:39:20,294
Isn't that what
you're being compensated for?

854
00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:21,957
Forget compensation!

855
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:23,711
You better give me someone
to take the hit

856
00:39:23,746 --> 00:39:25,974
for those burning murders
this morning right now,

857
00:39:26,009 --> 00:39:27,922
or I swear to God,
I will make sure

858
00:39:27,957 --> 00:39:32,642
that blackmail box stays
in little Armenia permanently.

859
00:39:40,123 --> 00:39:42,191
<I>Watch him die.

860
00:39:43,891 --> 00:39:45,773
<I>Certain kind of person...

861
00:39:45,808 --> 00:39:48,661
<I>might make you feel
like superman.

862
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,962
<I>I was never big
on comic books.

863
00:39:54,997 --> 00:39:57,301
16 years old,
already figured out

864
00:39:57,336 --> 00:39:59,679
how to commit a crime like this
and walk away clean.

865
00:39:59,714 --> 00:40:01,282
If he was gonna break,
he would have.

866
00:40:01,317 --> 00:40:03,721
Even if he had confessed, it
wouldn't have been admissible.

867
00:40:03,756 --> 00:40:05,773
What if I'm right?

868
00:40:05,808 --> 00:40:07,089
There are times
when you entertain

869
00:40:07,124 --> 00:40:09,005
the possibility
that you're not?

870
00:40:09,769 --> 00:40:12,572
We let this go, and luis is
just victim number one.

871
00:40:12,607 --> 00:40:14,067
He's a kid.

872
00:40:14,102 --> 00:40:15,586
He's already pulled off
the perfect murder.

873
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:18,408
Maybe it went down
just like he says.

874
00:40:18,443 --> 00:40:19,746
We'll never know.

875
00:40:19,781 --> 00:40:22,323
Until victim number two.

876
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:32,146
<I>Go ahead and sign that
if you're satisfied.

877
00:40:33,042 --> 00:40:34,205
Everything we have
on rios.

878
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,398
I tried before, Vic.
He's not in our system.

879
00:40:36,433 --> 00:40:38,118
Try again.

880
00:40:40,886 --> 00:40:43,112
You think he's connected to
the shooting in little Armenia?

881
00:40:43,147 --> 00:40:44,328
Vic.

882
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:50,255
Councilman David Aceveda,
federal agent Olivia Murray.

883
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:51,390
Councilman.

884
00:40:53,698 --> 00:40:56,307
I'll, um,
shake a few more trees, then.

885
00:40:56,342 --> 00:40:57,835
Thanks.

886
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:04,882
Hey, man, I didn't know
what was gonna go down.

887
00:41:04,917 --> 00:41:07,751
You have me give you
an Armenian win,

888
00:41:07,786 --> 00:41:10,226
and their march turns
into a goddamn killing?

889
00:41:10,261 --> 00:41:11,509
That was never part
of the plan.

890
00:41:11,544 --> 00:41:14,090
You know,
Martin was my colleague, Vic.

891
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:15,786
Now, you may not care
who has to die

892
00:41:15,821 --> 00:41:17,610
to save your job,
your ass,

893
00:41:17,645 --> 00:41:19,736
but I did not sign up
for this!

894
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:20,954
You signed up for this

895
00:41:20,989 --> 00:41:23,289
the moment you got into bed
with Pezuela.

896
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:27,602
I want Pezuela in prison
and out of my life now!

897
00:41:27,637 --> 00:41:29,360
Martin didn't
deserve to die,

898
00:41:29,395 --> 00:41:30,837
but now we have
something concrete.

899
00:41:30,872 --> 00:41:32,909
And something
we cannot prove, Vic.

900
00:41:32,944 --> 00:41:34,364
<I>Maybe we can't,

901
00:41:34,399 --> 00:41:37,226
but that's why I've been
reaching out to Olivia Murray.

902
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:41,161
If she can make a connection
between rios and the cartel,

903
00:41:41,196 --> 00:41:43,288
it insulates us.

904
00:41:43,323 --> 00:41:46,039
Pezuela goes down,
maybe I keep my job,

905
00:41:46,074 --> 00:41:49,343
and you stay teed up
for the bigger office.

906
00:41:55,033 --> 00:41:56,123
Hey, who's that?

907
00:41:56,158 --> 00:41:57,492
Pedro and miguel.

908
00:41:57,527 --> 00:41:59,267
Still got smoke in their hair
from the fire they set.

909
00:41:59,302 --> 00:42:01,475
Witness at the arson site
was afraid to come forward

910
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,873
until the Robert Martin
shooting.

911
00:42:02,908 --> 00:42:04,966
Okay, good.

912
00:42:05,001 --> 00:42:08,143
Make sure the entire team
expresses their gratitude.

913
00:42:14,302 --> 00:42:15,842
Why kill the controller?

914
00:42:15,877 --> 00:42:17,917
He supported your cause.

915
00:42:19,088 --> 00:42:20,928
Mexicans wanted to make it
clear they didn't.

916
00:42:20,963 --> 00:42:21,947
They think
I had something to do

917
00:42:21,982 --> 00:42:25,153
with the genocide memorial
being proposed?

918
00:42:25,188 --> 00:42:26,640
Yeah.

919
00:42:27,956 --> 00:42:29,410
We need to find this box.

920
00:42:29,445 --> 00:42:31,362
Yeah, well, good luck.

921
00:42:31,397 --> 00:42:35,385
I need your help to do it.
It's your final favor.

922
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,342
And you and your friend

923
00:42:36,377 --> 00:42:39,550
are free from
my organization's punishment.

924
00:42:41,086 --> 00:42:42,828
Well, all right, then.

925
00:42:45,903 --> 00:42:46,986
Hey, you got a sec?

926
00:42:47,021 --> 00:42:49,649
Sure. Two, even.

927
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:52,138
I just need you
to sign this.

928
00:42:52,173 --> 00:42:54,322
It's about Lee.
My lawyer Drew it up.

929
00:42:54,357 --> 00:42:55,465
Your lawyer?

930
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,855
Since when do we talk
through a mouthpiece?

931
00:43:00,906 --> 00:43:02,655
You want to tell me
what this shit means?

932
00:43:03,653 --> 00:43:06,245
That you waive
your parental rights to my son.

933
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,692
We've talked
about this before.

934
00:43:07,727 --> 00:43:08,766
It's just in writing
this time.

935
00:43:08,801 --> 00:43:11,397
I see that.
I thought we were okay.

936
00:43:11,432 --> 00:43:13,325
We are.

937
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,576
Then why is it
in writing this time?

938
00:43:15,611 --> 00:43:18,434
So that there's no confusion
down the road.

939
00:43:24,556 --> 00:43:26,976
Just get it
back to me, okay?

940
00:43:43,648 --> 00:43:46,255
You forget to hit me up
for a campaign contribution?

941
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,878
That fed in the Clubhouse,
how close is she to the truth?

942
00:43:49,913 --> 00:43:53,085
Agent Murray's looking
to take down the cartel.

943
00:43:53,615 --> 00:43:57,220
Connecting Pezuela to them
is just a win-win for all of us.

944
00:43:57,255 --> 00:43:59,093
Yeah, well, I thought I'd seen
her name somewhere before.

945
00:43:59,128 --> 00:44:01,055
Tonight, I confirmed it.

946
00:44:06,694 --> 00:44:08,342
She's in the blackmail box?

947
00:44:08,377 --> 00:44:11,302
Which means the face
of your plan's crucial next step

948
00:44:11,337 --> 00:44:13,697
is on the hook to Pezuela.

949
00:44:15,925 --> 00:44:17,971
How much have you told her?

950
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:22,003
Hey. He's got her
in his pocket.

951
00:44:22,038 --> 00:44:24,042
How much
have you told her?

952
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:30,160
Enough to blow it
with Pezuela...

953
00:44:30,195 --> 00:44:32,787
and get us both killed.

954
00:44:33,746 --> 00:44:37,670
