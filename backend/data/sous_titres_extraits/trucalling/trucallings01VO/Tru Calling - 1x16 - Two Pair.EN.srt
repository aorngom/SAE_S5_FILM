1
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:18,076
Did Harrison call?
Hi. No, was he supposed to?

2
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:21,609
He was supposed to give me a lift.
But, never mind.

3
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,987
I'm not gonna let anything
ruin my mood today because....

4
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:26,719
Look at me, Davis.

5
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:28,421
It's the new woman.

6
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:31,020
And she would be different
from the old woman because?

7
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:32,928
I won't put everything on hold anymore...

8
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:35,695
just because a few corpses
get conversational with me.

9
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:38,794
From now on,
I'm back in control of my own life.

10
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:40,065
But....

11
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:42,700
How you doing? You look a little tired.

12
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,539
I've got this thing tomorrow
at my apartment.

13
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:48,672
- And I haven't unpacked.
- When did you move in?

14
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,375
Three years ago.

15
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,947
Yes, some people are coming over,
because a guy I know from JPL...

16
00:00:57,023 --> 00:01:00,515
is feeding us images
from the Mars Spirit Rover, and--

17
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:02,458
Why don't I help you unpack?

18
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:05,794
Really? All right.
Then it'll be me, you, and Jack.

19
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,097
Jack? Why is he--

20
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:10,328
Because he volunteered
before you showed up.

21
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:11,995
Honey, I'm home.

22
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:20,141
Shot through the heart,
found in an alley downtown.

23
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,180
<i>FamiIy's on the way.</i>

24
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:26,285
Still got her lD and wallet.
Not your average mugging.

25
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:30,083
Melissa Sumner. 19. College student.

26
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,254
I like a girl
who pays attention to the details.

27
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:34,486
It's my job.

28
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,826
But not everyone does it so well,
or so thoroughly.

29
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:44,130
Help me.

30
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:02,450
Hey, you okay?

31
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,282
Yeah.

32
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,818
I got to go. Just one sec.

33
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:18,402
That body that just came in,
she asked for help.

34
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,268
- Just now?
- Just now.

35
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,205
But you're still here.

36
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:25,336
That's because nothing happened.

37
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,176
No rewind. Nothing.

38
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:48,556
Help me.

39
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,922
Are you sure you didn't imagine this?

40
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:15,825
Davis, please. I may be overworked,
but I'm not hallucinating.

41
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,730
So is this it?
Am I never gonna rewind again?

42
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:21,460
- We may never know.
- Did I do something wrong? Or--

43
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:25,732
No. Don't start that now. You put yourself
on the line for these people.

44
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,829
You've done nothing wrong.

45
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,032
Maybe it didn't happen for a reason.

46
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,577
Something specific to this case, this girl.

47
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:36,979
A college student. You think
there's something special about her?

48
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,451
Hey. Melissa Sumner's parents
are here for an lD.

49
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,188
I guess we'll find out.

50
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,028
Mrs. Sumner, I'm sure
this is of little comfort to you now...

51
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,768
but I am truly sorry for your loss.

52
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,739
We always told her
how dangerous the city is.

53
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,945
How she should just hand over her wallet
if someone wanted it.

54
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:09,311
Actually, Mr. Sumner,
her wallet was still with her.

55
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:10,747
<i>$20 inside.</i>

56
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:15,887
Can you think of anyone who might have
had animosity towards your daughter?

57
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:16,979
No!

58
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,192
<i>MeIissa was....</i>
<i>She got aIong with everyone.</i>

59
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,421
<i>She was aIways a good girI.</i>

60
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,093
She was so bright.

61
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,634
She had a brilliant future and....

62
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,602
Honey.

63
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,346
Honey,
you shouldn't be here, okay?

64
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,276
We'll go outside.

65
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:58,222
The worst part of not rewinding
is watching the family.

66
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,131
All that pain every day,
how do you stand it?

67
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,996
You get used to it.

68
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,029
Where're you going?

69
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,233
I can't just leave it like this.
I mean, I can try and find out...

70
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,368
what happened to Melissa
and why she asked for my help.

71
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,378
I know, I am sorry, okay?
I forgot to pick you up...

72
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:24,753
- but something unexpected came up.
- A girl or a bet?

73
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:28,349
Hey, it was an emergency of a kind.

74
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:32,856
Okay, so I boxed a trifecta at 3- 4- 7.
It was 3- 4- 6.

75
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,631
I was only off by one.

76
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:38,228
But who would've thought that
Vanilla Custer wouldn't pass a urine test?

77
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,603
- You know what, just forget it.
- What's your hurry?

78
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,101
My hurry is
that a body just asked for my help.

79
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:49,174
This is a do- over day,
and you let me lose $200?

80
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:52,843
It's not a do- over. The body asked for help,
and nothing happened.

81
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,716
What, were you fired?

82
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,782
I was Melissa's roommate,
but we really didn't talk much.

83
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,861
She always had her head in a book.

84
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:06,126
She was doing
a math and engineering double major.

85
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,828
And she was a teaching assistant,
and had a 3. 9 grade point average.

86
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:13,599
Any arguments, disagreements?
I mean, was she upset about anything?

87
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:17,164
She seemed fine. Everything was normal.

88
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:21,880
- I'm sorry I can't be more help.
- No, I appreciate it.

89
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:26,544
You know, it's not like Melissa and I
were really friends.

90
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:31,817
But I go back to the room now,
and all of her stuff is still there.

91
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:34,619
- Like she'll walk in any second.
- Yeah.

92
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:40,098
But I guess this is just another day to you.

93
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,771
Good. Thanks for coming.
No problem.

94
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,504
This is it. How'd it go?

95
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,345
Actually it didn't go very far.

96
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,384
The roommate backs up the parents.

97
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:01,648
Nobody has any clue
why anyone would shoot Melissa.

98
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:05,088
At least you're starting to build
a picture of who she was.

99
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,558
- Hey, Tru.
- Hey, Jack.

100
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,822
I put all 13 episodes of <i>I, CIaudius...</i>

101
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:13,388
on the same shelf as <i>The X- FiIes</i> videos.
Is that wrong?

102
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,532
What, you were serious
about alphabetizing?

103
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,207
Wow. Davis is a dedicated employee,
isn't he?

104
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,710
He really takes his work home
with him.

105
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,110
I'm trying to imagine
a first- date scenario.

106
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:31,639
Why don't you come to my apartment?
I'll show you all my books on death.

107
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:35,551
- Kind of a mood killer.
- Unless you're dating a serial killer.

108
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:38,923
Hey, Davis. We were just checking out
some of your books.

109
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:42,085
I thought you guys were here
to help me unpack.

110
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,231
Who's this?

111
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:53,236
- Someone special, I presume?
- We were together, now we're not.

112
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,833
Look, Harbor Marina. She's pretty.
Yeah.

113
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,408
You still talk to her?

114
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:06,181
Look, I think I can take care of the rest
of this if you guys want to take off.

115
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:12,950
He's a funny guy, isn't he?

116
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,492
- Funny?
- Yeah.

117
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,994
He lives alone, he makes death his career.

118
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:20,294
Have you ever noticed how
he always avoids talking about himself?

119
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,493
Come on, he's just eccentric, that's all.

120
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:25,162
- How much do you know about him?
- Plenty.

121
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,569
Really? Then tell me this.

122
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:31,239
Is Davis his first name or his last name?

123
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:36,515
I'll bet he knows a lot about you, though,
doesn't he?

124
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,044
I got a pickup.
I'll see you back at the morgue.

125
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,585
Yeah, see you there.

126
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:54,324
Why?

127
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,603
What do you want from me?

128
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,466
How can I help you?

129
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,804
Talking to yourself?

130
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:07,237
Occupational hazard in a place like this.

131
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,974
You know what I always say.

132
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,949
When they start answering back,
then it's time to worry.

133
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,645
<i>Look at this guy.</i>

134
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:18,346
Swallowed a whole bottle of downers.

135
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:20,185
What have we got?

136
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,296
Check this out.

137
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,836
No lD, but he picked up
a lot of business cards.

138
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,303
Maybe he was a salesman.

139
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:35,306
And the piece de résistance.

140
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,968
"Jean, I'm sorry, please forgive me."

141
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,672
Signed, Geoffrey.

142
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:45,013
Short, concise, to the point.
Got to admire that.

143
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,618
Save me.

144
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:11,803
Davis. Two bodies, one day. We got to talk.

145
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,719
Davis, where are you?

146
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,699
No lD, but he's picked up
a bunch of business cards.

147
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,034
You're here early.

148
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:46,845
I need to talk to Davis. A personal matter.

149
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:52,850
You rely on him a lot,
for someone you know nothing about.

150
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,413
Or am I wrong about that?

151
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,195
See you, Tru.

152
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,403
Look, Harbor Marina.

153
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,706
"H. Clarke."

154
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:22,203
I got here as fast as I could.
You want to go talk in the office?

155
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,317
Could these two people
be connected in some way?

156
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,754
<i>What does a murdered coIIege student...</i>

157
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,322
and a businessman's suicide
have in common?

158
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,732
We don't even have a last name
on the suicide.

159
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,361
He signed the note"Geoffrey."
No lD, no address?

160
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,632
We didn't find any.

161
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,709
But I did find a bunch
of different business cards in his pocket.

162
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:53,210
I checked the company names
on the computer. Get this:

163
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,746
they all had the same address.

164
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,406
It sounds like a place to start.

165
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:59,007
Two people to save, double workload.

166
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:00,715
You gonna be okay?

167
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,256
I'll be fine.
I got a head start on Melissa yesterday.

168
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,329
Can I help you?
Yeah.

169
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,403
Does the name H. Clarke
mean anything to you?

170
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,728
Why do you ask?

171
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:24,401
Tru was looking it up on her computer...

172
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:27,002
and I was just wondering
whether I'd lost a body.

173
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,946
I mean, H. Clarke wasn't on the list,
but maybe....

174
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,449
It probably doesn't mean anything.

175
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,011
Okay.

176
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,658
I need to borrow your car.

177
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:53,505
- That's so weird. I was coming--
- No, you weren't gonna come and get me.

178
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:57,064
And if I were you,
I'd stay away from the trifecta, too.

179
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,736
That is so not fair.
You know what I did and I don't.

180
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:03,509
You let me down again. Nothing you
haven't done a thousand times before.

181
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,949
And you know what? Lindsay says
the same exact thing about you, too.

182
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,386
Well, excuse me. I made a mistake.

183
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,015
I'm not lucky like you.
You screw up, and it's:

184
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,651
"What am I gonna do?
You know what, I'll just redo it."

185
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,388
That's right, I'm lucky, right?

186
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:21,024
Because I have two lives to save today
and I have no idea how I'm gonna do it?

187
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,227
You know what? Let me help you on this.

188
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,168
Help me?
You forgot to even come pick me up.

189
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:28,729
Look, I know about that, but look...

190
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:33,077
I'm good with people, you know that.
And I've helped you before.

191
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:37,780
You don't have a lot of options.
You got two lives, right?

192
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:42,146
You got to trust somebody. Why not me?

193
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:47,953
I swear, Tru, I will not let you down.

194
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:53,494
Okay, I'll tell you everything I know
about Melissa Sumner...

195
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,090
but I need you to pay attention...

196
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,931
because you never know
what's gonna be important.

197
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:01,473
Okay, drive to Hudson,
its uptown campus, Waverly Hall.

198
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,065
She's gonna TA a math class at noon.

199
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,244
All right, that's it for today, class.

200
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:13,342
Just remember, when you think
something is random, it isn't.

201
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,977
<i>It's aII about patterns.</i>

202
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:19,081
As Einstein once said,
"God doesn't play dice with the universe."

203
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:26,521
I liked that little lecture thing there,
especially the end part.

204
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:31,796
I'm not sure I agree with it, though,
about God not playing dice.

205
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,470
You feel up to arguing with Einstein?

206
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,565
Well, gambling's fun, right?

207
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:41,374
It just stands to reason that God would
wanna have a good time with His creation.

208
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:46,409
Probabilities are fun for you and me,
because we can't see the future.

209
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,385
But since God already knows all the cards...

210
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:51,014
he probably doesn't get
the same kick out of it.

211
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,320
No, that's where you're wrong.

212
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,027
I actually know
a little bit about the future myself.

213
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,064
You do?
Yeah.

214
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,097
I see you. I see me.

215
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,296
We're having lunch together.

216
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:09,697
Nice try, but I see separate tables.

217
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,206
Right.

218
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,114
"368 West 1st Street."

219
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,147
Hello, Harry.

220
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,120
It's a little harder than I thought.

221
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:26,055
I've known bail bondsmen
who are friendlier than this chick.

222
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:30,528
Right. So listen, you have to get
into this girl's life, Harrison.

223
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,531
<i>Whatever her pIans are for today,</i>
<i>you've got to change them.</i>

224
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,464
You can do it. Just be yourself.

225
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,195
I was myself.

226
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:39,596
- You hit on her?
- No.

227
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:44,068
Well, not in so many....Yeah.

228
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,041
Then be your other self.

229
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,942
- Lie?
- Bingo.

230
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:51,409
Got it.

231
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,251
You committed to 6, 000 pounds
of bison meat.

232
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,695
<i>This pIace isn't even refrigerated.</i>

233
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:08,631
<i>Okay, damn it, you can't get mad cow</i>
<i>from freaking buffaIo.</i>

234
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,635
<i>That's why they caII it"cow."</i>

235
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,670
All right, hold on a second,
just hold on.

236
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:19,105
Hello? Jean, hi,
it's so good to hear your voice.

237
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,010
No, it's great timing.

238
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,249
Yeah, it's not even
midnight here.

239
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,651
<i>No, that's right, Hong Kong doesn't sIeep.</i>

240
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:34,052
<i>Listen, honey, I'm right in the middIe</i>
<i>of finishing dinner with some cIients.</i>

241
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:38,055
No, it's going really well. It's going great.

242
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,621
<i>I miss you, too.</i>
<i>Yeah, I'II be home in a few days.</i>

243
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,362
Okay. I love you, sweetheart.

244
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,164
Hello?

245
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:49,341
Hello?

246
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:51,670
Damn it.

247
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,870
- Man of many names?
- Can I help you?

248
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:59,312
Yeah, I'm here to see Geoffrey.
I'm from the bank.

249
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,515
I just talked to your manager.

250
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,286
I told him I'd get the money today,
and I will.

251
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,221
<i>I'm working on something right now.</i>

252
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,385
Always a scheme?
I have a brother like you.

253
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:13,454
Look, the bank's gonna get their money.
I've got everything under control.

254
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,433
- So, thank you for stopping by.
- No problem.

255
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,014
You know, I come up here to be alone.

256
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,824
I can see why, it's a great spot for it.

257
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,918
If you're looking for a girl,
this campus is full of them.

258
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,828
Look, no offense, and....

259
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,200
This is so embarrassing.

260
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:53,133
I need some help with some math tutoring.

261
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:58,065
Really? What do you need help with?
Advanced calculus? Beginner?

262
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,176
Ah, um...

263
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:04,541
Fractions. I need some help
with some fractions.

264
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:06,913
Come on.

265
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,721
Okay, you multiply, divide, and...

266
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,655
one goes over the other...

267
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:16,558
and those little slashes?
What is that about? It's confusing.

268
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,458
No, the thing is...

269
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,831
you look like you need a break.

270
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,637
You're all
about patterns, right?

271
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,798
Why don't you break out of yours?

272
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:32,673
Look, I'm sorry.
You seem like a really nice guy, but...

273
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,911
I've got a lot to do.

274
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,779
Right.

275
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:48,518
Harbor Marina?
Yeah, I'm looking for H. Clarke.

276
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,290
The owner of a boat called <i>The Comet.</i>

277
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,089
Yeah, I'll hold.

278
00:18:57,236 --> 00:19:00,433
Doctor's office.
Try getting a human being on the phone.

279
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:05,903
Yeah, I'm still here.

280
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,866
You here for the poker game?
It's high stakes players only.

281
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,137
I'll be right back.

282
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:17,178
Harrison, what do you know
about a poker game...

283
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,046
at a place called The Countdown Club?

284
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:21,779
That place. Once a month
they have a high- stakes game...

285
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,684
where they throw out all the small fries.

286
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,746
I don't know,
I've only heard rumors about it.

287
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:29,157
It looks like Geoffrey's gonna lose
and kill himself sometime tonight.

288
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,322
He's desperate for the money.
Think you could get into the game?

289
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,560
lnto the game?
What about Melissa? And besides...

290
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,233
you need $5, 000 to have a stake.

291
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:41,738
Right. Just stay where you are,
I'll get the money and bring it to you.

292
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,741
<i>We're gonna switch.</i>
<i>Poker's your worId.</i>

293
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:46,243
You take Geoffrey,
and I'll take care of Melissa.

294
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:49,144
Where are you gonna get that kind of cash?

295
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:50,437
Tru?

296
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,148
Vanilla Custer flunked the urine test.
Or so you told me yesterday.

297
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:05,424
You pick winners for perfect strangers,
but not even your own bro?

298
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:06,896
Where is Melissa?

299
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:10,662
She's in her dorm.
That's the only entrance, right over there.

300
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,966
And, hey, good luck.

301
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:21,913
Hello?

302
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:25,142
I ran one of those aliases you gave me
through a credit bureau.

303
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:29,779
Harold Smith co- signed a loan
for, get this, Geoffrey Pine.

304
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,189
Pine? We finally got a last name.

305
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:35,784
<i>I think Geoffrey creates</i>
<i>new identities to open new Iines of credit.</i>

306
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:39,695
And probably get away from those people
he owed money to when things got bad.

307
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,097
He must be deeper in the hole
than he's ever been...

308
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,759
if he's committing suicide over this.

309
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,599
His wife has no idea.
She thinks he's in Hong Kong.

310
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,138
He's been living a lie.

311
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:52,134
<i>You know what the crazy thing is?</i>
<i>He's not a bad guy.</i>

312
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:56,772
With all of his schemes and everything,
he reminds me so much of Harrison.

313
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:59,578
Mirror images, duality, life and death.

314
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,152
That's a way a lot of religions
see the universe.

315
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,585
Davis, I got to go.

316
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:35,085
Hello.
<i>I'm at the game.</i>

317
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,084
And I'm just checking in.

318
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:40,591
Great. Don't lose track of Geoffrey
while you're staring at your cards.

319
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,320
<i>No, come on, Tru.</i>

320
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:46,423
<i>I wiII not Iet you down. I swear.</i>

321
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:49,394
<i>Everything is under controI.</i>

322
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:51,661
Tru?

323
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:06,583
Did you follow me here?

324
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:11,781
How could I follow you if I was here first?

325
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:15,755
Now that you mention it,
I think you should leave. Like now.

326
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:19,460
- All right, who the hell are you?
- Maybe I'm a friend of your wife's.

327
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:20,725
Not with that tell.

328
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,664
"Tell?"
It's a giveaway.

329
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,703
You looked away when you lied,
and you pushed your hair back.

330
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,239
No, seriously,
I think you should get out of here.

331
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:31,605
What is it with you?
Why are you obsessed with me leaving?

332
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:36,409
I just have a feeling that you
might have some bad luck here tonight.

333
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:39,575
Yeah, nice try at psyching out
your competition.

334
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:42,313
But I need this money, and I'm not moving.

335
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:43,615
Come on.

336
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:47,156
What does a young, pretty,
smart girl like yourself...

337
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:49,250
need with that kind of money?

338
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:52,455
Your wife doesn't know
about your secret life, does she?

339
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:56,297
Guess what, when they take your house
away, I'm sure she's gonna figure it out.

340
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,199
You don't understand.

341
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,137
My wife told me to straighten up my act
a long time ago.

342
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,071
She thinks I did.

343
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:10,312
I've been putting my theories
of probability to practical use.

344
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,449
I've been gambling, okay? A lot.

345
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,214
Got it.

346
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,688
Over the long run, I tend to win.

347
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:22,221
But over the short run, I....

348
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,451
Hmm?

349
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,789
I lost my tuition money.

350
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,099
You mean all of it?

351
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,304
Look, I can fix this, okay?

352
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:38,069
I can win. I just need one good streak.

353
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,473
That's why I'm here.

354
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,913
Consider me your good luck charm.

355
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:48,181
In a few days, the school
is gonna write a letter to my parents...

356
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:51,552
unless I head it off
by getting this money tonight.

357
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:55,688
Look, this is my last chance, Harrison.

358
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,963
I like you, but I'm gonna have to beat you.

359
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,358
Flush beats the pair.

360
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,590
How about a break?
Yeah.

361
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:23,409
No offense, but as a good luck charm,
you're not working hard enough.

362
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,681
Damn, she's a hell of a player.

363
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:34,316
She probably won last night, too.
That's why she was killed, for the money.

364
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:38,158
So, Geoffrey lost, offed himself,
and Melissa won and--

365
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,424
And was robbed and shot
in the alley outside.

366
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,363
If she leaves broke, it'll keep her alive.

367
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,231
But then she gets kicked out of school.

368
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:47,567
We have to think of this as an ER.
We have to save their lives.

369
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:49,367
You have to beat her, Harrison.

370
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,635
Not to shock you or anything,
but I'm trying.

371
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:55,179
- You have a tell.
- I do not!

372
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:57,737
You pull on your collar
whenever you're bluffing.

373
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:00,148
You playing?
Yeah.

374
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:05,313
Just remember who
the experienced poker player is, okay?

375
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,404
Straight beats two pair.

376
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,000
The ace.

377
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:59,000
Yeah!

378
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:13,889
Congratulations,
you were faking the tell.

379
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,887
Well, you know...

380
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:19,758
it was only the last one, so....

381
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,822
Um, this is, uh...

382
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,431
This is really awkward for me.

383
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:27,665
I got to warn you.
I'm in a serious relationship and--

384
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:31,208
Look, Harrison, the truth is
I really need this money.

385
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:36,044
Do you think that you would consider
loaning it to me?

386
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:40,210
I mean, I would pay you back
with interest and everything.

387
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:43,378
If you'd just give me a little bit of time....

388
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:48,787
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

389
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:53,189
Yeah.

390
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:54,726
Thanks.

391
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:06,038
This whole knowing the future thing....

392
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:09,906
- It can really suck.
- Yeah, sometimes.

393
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:12,447
That was just step one,
because step two is...

394
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:15,247
now you lose all that money to Geoffrey.

395
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:20,082
Why don't you just stick a bullet
right through my heart?

396
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:22,421
Start losing, Harry.

397
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,667
Hi, I'm looking for H. Clarke.

398
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,203
I'm Hope Clarke.

399
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,434
Are you the owner of the boat
registered out at the Harbor Marina?

400
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:40,807
Well, I'm not the sailor in the family.
My daughter, Haley, bought it.

401
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:44,304
Then can I talk to Haley?

402
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:48,083
May I ask you what this is about?

403
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:16,870
Two lousy pairs. I'm out.

404
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:27,281
Good luck charm says cash out.

405
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,626
Are you crazy?

406
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:33,526
A little friendly advice, pal.
Leave while you're ahead.

407
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,031
You got to be kidding me.

408
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:38,466
I'm on a streak
and there's still money on the table.

409
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:41,437
There's always
money on the table somewhere.

410
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:52,650
So, I guess I'm never gonna know
who the hell you are.

411
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:54,949
Guess not.

412
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,882
Well....

413
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:02,393
I think I'm gonna go surprise my wife
with an early return from Hong Kong.

414
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:06,594
Thank you.

415
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:18,833
I can't believe
I voluntarily lost all that money.

416
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:20,706
Welcome to my world.

417
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:24,014
Now, I've got to go to work.
What about you?

418
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:26,742
Melissa left here
thinking I'm some kind of jerk...

419
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:28,718
so might as well try to find her...

420
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:31,619
and make sure
she knows it wasn't personal.

421
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:37,786
Hey.

422
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:41,287
You did good.

423
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,328
You ain't so bad yourself.

424
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,030
<i>He was great, Davis.</i>

425
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:50,268
I mean, two people saved,
and he didn't just leave it at that.

426
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:54,209
He's gone to see Melissa
to try to make things right with her.

427
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:57,911
What's with Geoffrey Pine?

428
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:01,008
Just this feeling I have,
like there's unfinished business.

429
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,553
The truth is,
I may have saved his life this time...

430
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:05,452
but if he doesn't make some changes....

431
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:08,185
The man reminds me so much of Harrison,
I can't just....

432
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,420
<i>HeIIo?</i>
Can I speak to Geoffrey?

433
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,793
<i>He's stiII in Hong Kong.</i>
<i>Can I take a message?</i>

434
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:15,424
No message. Thanks. Bye.
<i>Bye.</i>

435
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:19,261
His wife says he's still in Hong Kong.

436
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:22,431
He left to go see her.
He should be home by now.

437
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:25,639
I better go make sure Geoffrey's okay.

438
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,608
Tru, it may be nothing.

439
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,672
- We talked about duality, mirror images?
- Yeah.

440
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:35,214
Murder and suicide on day one.

441
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,513
If that were a complete mirror image,
you know what would happen.

442
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,037
Hello? Melissa?

443
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:03,779
Mel? Hey, you in here?

444
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,694
Hey, Harrison.

445
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:29,103
I'm at the campus.
Melissa left a suicide note.

446
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,368
<i>My God.</i>
You need to get down here.

447
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,569
<i>I can't.</i>
<i>I'd never make it there on time.</i>

448
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,839
Geoff's still in danger.
He never went home.

449
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:38,643
You know where he is.
Where does any gambler go?

450
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:41,711
- He went back to the game.
- Just forget him, okay?

451
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:43,447
I know where she's got to be--

452
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,786
I have to reach Geoffrey.
He has no idea what he's walking into.

453
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,951
She's going to kill herself, Tru!

454
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,188
You are there. You can do this, Harry.

455
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:54,393
You can do this.

456
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,230
Melissa, I....

457
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,902
Look, I know why you're here and....

458
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:13,072
Melissa, I can help you.

459
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:17,948
Are you giving me the money after all?

460
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,290
Look, I would, but...

461
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,716
Um...

462
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:25,896
I don't have it anymore.

463
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,130
You lost it?

464
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,292
Hey, no, don't.

465
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,601
Hey, look.

466
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:36,834
Losing money
ain't the end of the world, right?

467
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:39,637
I mean, take it from me.
I can help you.

468
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,440
You can tell your parents.

469
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:46,176
No, I can't. I can't face them.

470
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:52,685
They work 16 hours a day
so that I can have a better life.

471
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,726
They gave up everything
for me and my sister.

472
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:00,353
How could I possibly tell them
I gambled away all my college money?

473
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:03,730
- They would never understand.
- There has to be another way out, okay?

474
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:07,931
No! It's hopeless. I would have to get
the money to school by tomorrow...

475
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:10,166
before they write a letter to my parents.

476
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,741
Hey, hold up.

477
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,635
Hey, look, uh...

478
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,307
my car.

479
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:20,274
My car. It ain't worth but $5, 000, but...

480
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:24,252
it's yours.

481
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:25,311
It's yours.

482
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:27,213
Huh?

483
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:31,962
Will that give you time?

484
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,529
You would do that for me?

485
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,107
Of course.

486
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:51,146
Come here. Come on.

487
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:57,779
Yeah.

488
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:06,830
What a night.

489
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:10,259
Looks like I don't need
my good luck charm after all.

490
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,564
I'm still on that hot streak.

491
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:14,796
That's tough luck, man. Maybe next time.

492
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:15,930
Hey!

493
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:19,367
Just stay calm
and hand me the money.

494
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:21,133
No!

495
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:57,381
You know, I don't know why
you keep looking out for me.

496
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:01,379
And I'm not sure I know how to thank you.

497
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:07,019
Well, if I was really looking out for you,
what do you think I'd say?

498
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,549
Tell my wife.

499
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:13,855
Harder than a high- stakes game.
Think you can handle it?

500
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:18,059
No. But it's time.

501
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:37,210
Hey. I got a pickup down in the van.

502
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:41,748
How do you get so banged up
on this job? The dead don't fight back.

503
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:43,054
You'd be surprised.

504
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:45,857
Hey, did you know that Davis was married?

505
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:50,493
His wife's dead.

506
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,965
Dead? He tell you this?

507
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:56,131
Davis? Volunteer personal information?
Are you kidding me?

508
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,208
I got an ear for gossip.

509
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,182
You got to come out with me.
I'm serious.

510
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:12,222
Don't know.
Get out of here.

511
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,315
Dude, live it up a little.

512
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,252
Hey.
Hi.

513
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:18,761
I rescued a pizza
on the way back.

514
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,557
After saving a damsel.
Yes, sir.

515
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:25,967
Is something wrong?

516
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:31,470
Yesterday, at your apartment,
there was a picture of a woman.

517
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:36,406
Maybe we should discuss that.

518
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:39,376
You know what, no,
it's none of my business, actually.

519
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:40,474
It is.

520
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:42,985
You know,
should I just go and--

521
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:46,251
No, stay, Harrison.
You deserve to hear this, too.

522
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:48,617
Okay.

523
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:56,866
We were married for a year.

524
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:58,925
You're married?

525
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:02,464
And I was supposed to meet Haley
at her mother's.

526
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:06,100
We were going to a restaurant
for our anniversary dinner.

527
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:11,709
I'd been working late here,
and I was going out to my car and...

528
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:17,685
the gas had all been drained from the tank,
the tires were flat.

529
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:21,987
There was this crazy woman there,
telling me I had to call my wife...

530
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:26,194
and prevent her from getting in her car
and getting on the freeway.

531
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:28,663
- Crazy woman?
- Our mother.

532
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:33,529
But I knew
the evening could be salvaged.

533
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:36,971
Haley knew if I was running late,
I could meet her at the restaurant.

534
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:39,634
Our mother didn't know where she was.

535
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:43,236
And you didn't call Haley.

536
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:48,010
To tell her that there was a lunatic
claiming she was gonna die that night?

537
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:52,245
<i>I thought, yeah, that'd be a great way</i>
<i>to say happy anniversary.</i>

538
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,249
What happened?

539
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:59,854
The autopsy said
that she had a seizure at the wheel...

540
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:05,027
and her car drifted over three lanes
before she was hit by a semi.

541
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:09,829
So on day one?

542
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,132
I died with her.

543
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:16,805
That's why you know so much.

544
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,641
That's why you understand.

545
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:23,216
Our mother saved you.

546
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,522
Davis, I'm so sorry.

547
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:32,986
It happened a long time ago.

548
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:36,555
And, you know, today is a celebration day.

549
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:37,859
Yeah.

550
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:39,660
Two lives saved.

551
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:40,931
Cheers.

552
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:43,629
So that's it?

553
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:46,933
No more shocking revelations?
No more secrets?

554
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:50,275
You officially know what I know.

555
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:52,679
Well, not everything, Davis.

556
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:57,818
- First name or last?
- Yes.

557
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:00,049
It's my middle. Actually, it's a funny story.

558
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:02,955
Hey, Jack? Hey, my man.

559
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:06,822
Why don't you come in here,
join the party? You work too hard.

560
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:09,024
Actually, it's a slow night.

561
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:11,499
I only had this pickup on campus.

562
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:14,629
What?

563
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:27,244
Harrison, let's just go sit down.
We'll figure out what happened.

564
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,945
She was all right when I left.

565
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:30,611
The suicide was a friend of his?

566
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:35,057
She was all right when I left.
Everything was fine.

567
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:38,788
Hey, man, it's easy to misjudge
when someone's depressed.

568
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:42,229
Who knows
what's going through their head?

569
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,677
- Where are you going?
- What difference does it make?

570
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:58,579
Lindsay was right about me.
You were right. I'm not like you.

571
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,378
I can't save anybody.

572
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:03,113
Not even myself.

573
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:06,881
Look, don't go. Just stay with me.
We can talk.

574
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:11,417
I got to get out of here.

575
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:19,830
I know this is of little comfort to you now...

576
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:22,904
but I am very sorry for your loss.

577
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:26,867
Why?

578
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:30,243
<i>Why'd she think she had to Iie?</i>

579
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,377
It was only money.

580
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,084
We put too much pressure on her.

581
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,451
Honey,
you shouldn't be here, okay?

582
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,853
We'll go outside.

583
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:47,761
Could you be any more specific?

584
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,364
We got a phone call.

585
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:56,602
A man said that Melissa had lost
all her tuition money playing cards.

586
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:02,837
Somebody told them.
Somebody told Melissa's parents.

587
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:05,279
They must have called her
after Harrison left.

588
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:08,341
They wanted an explanation.
That's why she killed herself.

589
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,820
But that doesn't make any sense.
On day one, they didn't know.

590
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:13,356
What changed?

591
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,123
<i>Who couId've done such a thing?</i>
