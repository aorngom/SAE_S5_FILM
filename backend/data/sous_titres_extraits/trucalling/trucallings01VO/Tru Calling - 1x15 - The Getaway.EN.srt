1
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:10,708
Hello?
<i>Tru, it's 1:00. Are you up?</i>

2
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,502
I am now. You know I work
the graveyard shift, right?

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,946
It's Jack's orientation.
You have to show him around.

4
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,415
Don't tell me you forgot.

5
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:20,317
No, Davis, I didn't forget.
I'm just running a bit late.

6
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:23,151
Okay. She's running late.

7
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:28,817
Okay, we can start over here.

8
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:32,389
This is the digital autopsy capture.
First we--

9
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:35,593
Scan the body with the camera
for any visible signs of trauma...

10
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,569
then enter the name and case number
into the database.

11
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:40,128
Right. Exactly.

12
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:45,039
Okay. Over here,
this is the live scan machine.

13
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:49,013
Used to log fingerprints,
flat panel to take hand impressions.

14
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:52,708
- I read the manuals.
- Good.

15
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:55,846
I wish someone had told me.
I wouldn't have gotten up so early.

16
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:59,380
Then we couldn't have spent
this quality time together.

17
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,989
And the truth is...

18
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:05,559
- there are a couple of things I don't know.
- Such as?

19
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,100
Such as, do you like working here?

20
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:13,438
The reason I ask is you don't look like
your average morgue attendant.

21
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:15,201
Yeah? And what do I look like?

22
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:18,733
You look like a girl
who takes things way too seriously.

23
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,143
Someone who should be
enjoying life...

24
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:25,082
but probably spends Friday nights
home alone watching TV...

25
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:27,243
eating a microwave dinner.

26
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,647
Should I bag the personals?

27
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:34,891
I don't spend every Friday night at home.
I mean....

28
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,792
Well, anyways,
what do you do on Friday nights?

29
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,593
Why don't you tell me?

30
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:43,864
Well, you don't stay in. That's for sure,
because that'd mean you'd be alone...

31
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,438
and you're not a guy
who's very keen on being alone.

32
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:49,134
So you go out to a bar or a club.

33
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:52,377
And after a few hours,
you return home, sometimes solo...

34
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:56,882
but usually with some nameless,
faceless, shameless girl...

35
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,043
who just doesn't understand you.

36
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,917
But either way,
by the end of the night...

37
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:06,288
you're alone, in front of the TV,
eating a microwave dinner.

38
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,328
I don't own a microwave.

39
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,765
But you still haven't answered
my question.

40
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,130
Do you like it here?

41
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:19,995
Actually, I do.

42
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:22,306
I understand.

43
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,335
You do? Because not everyone does.

44
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:30,982
That's because most people believe
that only the living need help.

45
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:49,224
Hand them over. Right now!

46
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,001
- Can I help you?
- You sure can.

47
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,342
Open the safe under the counter
and fill it up.

48
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:03,245
We don't have a safe.

49
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:10,555
Open it or she dies!
Please do what he says!

50
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,183
Now!

51
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:33,769
Help me.

52
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,697
- Harrison Davies?
- Yeah.

53
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:57,998
Are you Tru Davies' brother?
Who wants to know?

54
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:00,265
Michelle Carey, <i>Post Dispatch.</i>

55
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,338
Right, Tru told me all about you.

56
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,876
I have a couple of questions
about your sister.

57
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,037
She's been
at a series of crime scenes.

58
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,479
I was wondering
if you've anything to say about that.

59
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,983
Sorry, Michelle, I don't talk to the media.

60
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:15,145
They tend to make me a little nervous,
you know?

61
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:18,289
But I'll tell Tru
you were asking about her.

62
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,596
Harry, what a surprise.

63
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,689
You know me, I am full of them.

64
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,563
This is my brother, Harrison. This is Jack.

65
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,431
Jack Harper.
Nice to meet you.

66
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,003
You, too.
You got a sec?

67
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,629
Yeah.
Check.

68
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,270
I ran into
that reporter, Michelle.

69
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:38,332
And?

70
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,468
Didn't say a word.

71
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:42,742
<i>The gunman Ieft</i>
<i>the Lion's Lair Arcade at 2.:00 p. m...</i>

72
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:45,978
<i>and reIeased a hostage shortIy after.</i>
<i>We'II have more....</i>

73
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,676
So, what's up?

74
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:52,622
I just wanted to check in,
make sure you're doing okay.

75
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,156
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

76
00:04:56,696 --> 00:05:00,154
The whole thing with Dad
shooting the guy who killed Mom.

77
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,932
Yeah, I'm dealing with it the best I can.

78
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:08,465
You know, they haven't found the body.

79
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:13,201
You gotta hand it to the old man.
He really took care of things.

80
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,613
So is that the only reason you stopped by?

81
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:21,152
Well, now that you mention it...

82
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:25,354
it's me and Lindsay's
three- month anniversary.

83
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,518
I'm shocked you remembered.

84
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,926
I don't think it's a big deal,
but it means a lot to her.

85
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:35,627
So I booked reservations
at Le Petite Fleur....

86
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:39,369
- Whatever it is she's talking about.
- Good. She'll love that.

87
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,435
The problem is I'm a little tapped out.

88
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,738
But if you
could float some cash my way...

89
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:48,178
I can make sure that
your best friend, Lindsay...

90
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:51,242
has a night that she'll never forget.

91
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,281
Lucky it's payday.

92
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:56,680
Here.

93
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,019
Pretty expensive restaurant.

94
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,868
Of course, I should valet the car.

95
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:12,905
- Yeah, street parking. Not a problem.
- Get out.

96
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,564
Yeah, I'm going.

97
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,569
You are the best.

98
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,804
<i>And they're off.</i>

99
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:25,149
That's it, baby! Go! Come on, Eight Ball!

100
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:29,087
Hold on! Come on, Eight Ball.
Come on, go!

101
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,385
<i>Now Aidan's Luck swings up</i>
<i>on the outside.</i>

102
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:33,357
Do it for daddy, baby! Come on.

103
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,656
<i>It's Eight BaII bringing</i>
<i>to a narrow Iead.</i>

104
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,423
<i>And here comes Aidan's Luck.</i>

105
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:41,831
Just trying to parlay some cash
to bring the old lady out to a nice dinner.

106
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,599
<i>Eight BaII, Aidan's Luck</i>
<i>neck- and- neck.</i>

107
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:45,693
No!

108
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:49,468
<i>As they hit the finish Iine,</i>
<i>Aidan's Luck by a nose.</i>

109
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,773
- Looks like you guys are eating in.
- God.

110
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,773
No, that's cool.
I still got one more race, win it all back.

111
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,950
So, what do you think of
Hodge Podge and Nightcap?

112
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:06,582
Not much.
Look, I'm going with Deep Shaker.

113
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:08,787
Deep Shaker?

114
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,419
He's 20- to- 1.

115
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,023
Lots of luck with that, pal.

116
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,274
Hey, Tru.

117
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,106
What's up?

118
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,577
I just wanted to say thanks
for giving up your afternoon...

119
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,275
- to come in here and help me.
- It's no problem.

120
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:33,580
- So we're okay, you and me?
- Yeah, why wouldn't we be?

121
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:37,555
I just want to make sure.
I didn't want to come off like a know- it- all.

122
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:41,024
- No, you didn't. Perfectly, well--
- Hey, Tru.

123
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:42,885
Oh.

124
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,623
Luc, hi.

125
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:52,299
This is Jack, the new forensics assistant.
Luc's a crime scene photographer.

126
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,566
- Nice to meet you.
- Same here.

127
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,868
So....

128
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,209
So, how have you been?
Fine.

129
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,451
- Busy.
- Me, too.

130
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,310
You always are.

131
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:14,720
Speaking of busy, I....
You know, head back.

132
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,055
Well, I'll see you around.

133
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:20,596
See you, Jack.

134
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,827
Nice to meet you.
You, too.

135
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:27,037
So how long did you two date for?

136
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,431
What?
Come on, I saw it.

137
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,602
The long lingering looks,
the unfinished sentences.

138
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,875
- What are you talking about?
- I think it was about two months.

139
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:39,349
And then things got complicated,
and you broke up.

140
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:42,285
Only, now you're wondering
if you did the right thing...

141
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,289
or just the easy thing.

142
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,888
Okay, yeah, something like that.

143
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,120
Now's the part
where you're gonna lay into me...

144
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,857
for being that girl
who's way too serious, right?

145
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:52,955
No.

146
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:57,058
I was gonna tell you I'm sorry things
didn't work out the way you wanted.

147
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,310
- How did it go with Jack?
- Good, I think.

148
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,852
Did he mishandle equipment?
What did he do?

149
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,888
No, nothing like that.

150
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,818
He's a smart guy. He knows his stuff.

151
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,484
I just can't get a read on him,
for some reason.

152
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,654
It's like one minute he's in your face
and almost obnoxious.

153
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,197
The next, he's charming,
trying to be your best friend.

154
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,665
He's just trying to get acclimated,
you know.

155
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:31,032
You remember your first few days here?

156
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:36,908
Besides, we need the extra help,
especially with your other job.

157
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,476
Yeah, I guess.

158
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:41,739
Anyway, I've got to run.
I will see you tonight.

159
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,274
- Tonight?
- Yeah, Luc's show.

160
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,015
What show?

161
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,148
- Never mind.
- Davis.

162
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:53,680
Okay. Luc is having a photography show
at some gallery.

163
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,553
I'm sure it's no big deal.
I was only invited at the last minute.

164
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,496
No, it's fine. I mean, it's totally fine.

165
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,571
We broke up,
and I'm working tonight anyway.

166
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,874
- Did I mention it's fine?
- Yeah, three times.

167
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:12,172
- Well, it is. It's completely and totally--
- Fine.

168
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:23,380
You didn't have to go to all this trouble
for just three months.

169
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,890
Although I'm so glad that you did.

170
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:30,656
I can't wait to order dessert. They have
this amazing chocolate soufflé here.

171
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,126
Is everything okay?

172
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,327
Who? What's that?

173
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:41,365
Nothing. It just looks like
you're planning an escape or something.

174
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,603
Oh, my God. Here, drink some water.

175
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,343
- Sir, are you all right?
- Oh, my God!

176
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:56,816
A bone?

177
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:04,125
- This was in my veal. I almost choked!
- I'm terribly sorry, sir.

178
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:07,461
- Let me get you another dish.
- Another dish? And another bone?

179
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:08,761
I don't think so, pal.

180
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:11,735
I'm sure the maitre d'
will take your meal off the bill.

181
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:15,672
- My meal? What about hers?
- Harrison, it's fine. You're fine.

182
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:19,472
We're happy to pay for my meal,
and thank you for everything.

183
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,708
Harrison, sit down.

184
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,853
A fish bone? You ordered veal, you idiot.

185
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:35,118
Let me guess.
You don't have any money, do you?

186
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:40,765
It's just one more chapter in the
Harrison Davies book of disappointments.

187
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:44,131
Who would've thought
that Deep Shaker would have won?

188
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:48,070
It was a 20- to- 1 shot. 20- to- 1!

189
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:50,604
<i>In what is amounting</i>
<i>to a crime spree...</i>

190
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:52,439
<i>In what is amounting</i>
<i>to a crime spree...</i>

191
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:55,605
<i>the gunman once again used a customer</i>
<i>as a human shieId...</i>

192
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:59,344
<i>when he heId up the Pharsyde</i>
<i>CIothing Store shortIy after 6.:00 p. m.</i>

193
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,443
<i>The fact there were no security....</i>

194
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,580
Hey, Linds, how was dinner?
<i>Great.</i>

195
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,491
Until your brother pretended to choke
on his entrée.

196
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,619
What?
<i>Trying to get his meaI comped...</i>

197
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,526
because he blew his money
at the track today.

198
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:12,586
You're joking, right?

199
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,599
<i>I know</i>
<i>his heart's in the right pIace...</i>

200
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,659
but I really think
I'm at the end of my rope with him.

201
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:21,969
He's my brother and I love him, but....
Anything you need?

202
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:25,702
Besides a chocolate soufflé?
Look, I'll call you tomorrow.

203
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,242
Okay. Bye.

204
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:30,881
Harrison.

205
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,277
Is your brother in trouble?
Sorry, I couldn't help overhearing.

206
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:38,150
Is everything okay?
Just family stuff.

207
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,585
Siblings. They can get to you
like no one else.

208
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,787
You have brothers and sisters?

209
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:47,026
I had a sister.
She died a couple of years ago.

210
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,301
I'm so sorry.

211
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,301
Thanks. That's nice of you.

212
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:57,004
But I really feel like
she went to a better place.

213
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,635
<i>I know it sounds cIiché...</i>

214
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,644
but I really believe it's true.

215
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,316
She was sick, and then she wasn't.

216
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:10,788
Anyway, I know what you're going through
with your brother.

217
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:13,552
You feel like he's your responsibility.

218
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,417
Tell me about it.

219
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:19,225
Still, sometimes you gotta let them
make their own mistakes.

220
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,762
Learn the hard way, you know?

221
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,604
Speaking of mistakes....

222
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,572
I had this soup from the vending machine.

223
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,108
Forgot about that on your tour.

224
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,405
Anywhere around here
a guy can get some edible food?

225
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,917
Yeah, the diner two blocks up isn't bad.
I was gonna get some takeout.

226
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,612
- I'll get you something.
- Only if I can pay.

227
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,416
Sounds like a deal.

228
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:56,393
- Pickup for Davies.
- A couple more minutes.

229
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,933
Okay, I'll be right over there.

230
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,109
Hello, Tru.

231
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,512
- Do I know you?
- Michelle Carey.

232
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,642
We almost spoke on the phone
a couple of times.

233
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:14,083
I've got nothing to say to you.

234
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:17,748
I ran into your brother today.
He wouldn't talk to me, either.

235
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:20,485
You've been dodging my calls
for over a month now.

236
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,720
I'm sure your boss told you
about our chat?

237
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:25,229
He also told me
that he kicked you out of the office.

238
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:29,757
Aborted suicides, murder attempts,
near accidents. All these rescues.

239
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:34,266
What have you to say about showing up
each time before the police do?

240
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,432
Or the fact that your mother
did the same thing?

241
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,511
What are you talking about?
Where are you getting all this?

242
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:42,570
Doesn't matter. Now is the time
to give your side of the story...

243
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,843
or you'll read about it
in the paper next weekend.

244
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,385
I'll go to print
whether I get a quote from you or not.

245
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,818
Order's up.

246
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:53,116
At first I thought you had
some sort of hero complex.

247
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:56,423
Setting up these near misses
so you could rescue people just in time.

248
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:59,692
- But you never took any credit.
- There's nothing to take credit for.

249
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:01,733
No one moves or she dies!

250
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:07,829
Empty the register. Quick!

251
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,643
This guy hit two other places today.

252
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,681
He took a hostage each time,
then let them go.

253
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,376
Everyone shut up!

254
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,418
Fill it up.

255
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:28,926
I am not kidding. I'll kill her if you don't!

256
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,761
Police officer! Drop the gun!

257
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:54,442
Somebody get us some help, hurry!
It's gonna be okay, Michelle.

258
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,481
Here.

259
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,257
Hang on, Michelle.
Someone call 91 1, please!

260
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:07,231
Hang on, Michelle.
It's gonna be okay. Come on.

261
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,824
Hurry, please!

262
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:18,737
God, no.

263
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:21,943
Is she....

264
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,617
Yeah.

265
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,183
I need you.

266
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,692
- Hello?
- Tru, are you up?

267
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,570
- Because it's Jack's orientation today.
- Tell him I'll be right there.

268
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,501
Again.

269
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:00,244
Tru, to be honest,
this doesn't set a good example.

270
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,550
- Sorry, I didn't mean to keep you waiting.
- It's okay, I'm not busy.

271
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:07,615
Good. Then, Davis, can I talk to you
for one sec? In your office?

272
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,460
- Okay.
- Be right back.

273
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,231
I'll be here.

274
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,801
Michelle, the reporter,
is the one who asked for help?

275
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,738
Unfortunately. But not before she had all
these questions about me saving people.

276
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,398
Was there anyone else hurt?

277
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:26,478
The gunman grabbed a customer
who was wounded in the crossfire.

278
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,910
Then he dragged her out with him.

279
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,540
Now you must try to save
the woman trying to expose you.

280
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,813
Jeez Louise, talk about irony.
What do you know about the gunman?

281
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,582
Apparently, he was going on
some sort of crime spree today.

282
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,213
This guy hit two other places today.

283
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,350
<i>...he heId up the Pharsyde</i>
<i>CIothing Store shortIy after 6.:00 p. m.</i>

284
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,696
Three places in five hours: an arcade,
a clothing store, and then the diner.

285
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:48,358
And each time,
he uses a customer as a shield.

286
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,766
- That worries me.
- Davis, you're always worried.

287
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,896
No. The fact that Michelle's the one
that died concerns me.

288
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,406
Some people are fated to die
before their time.

289
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,933
And I believe that some people are fated
to lead to the death of others.

290
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:02,013
If you wind up back at the diner with her...

291
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,517
fate could be altered enough
where someone else could get shot.

292
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:09,283
Not to mention that if you save her,
you're exposed:

293
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,653
who you are, what you can do.
You've got to call the cops, Tru.

294
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:16,091
If you can get the gunman arrested
at either of the other two places...

295
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:20,029
he'll never make it to the diner.
Michelle will be safe and so will you.

296
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,431
- Okay, fine. I'll do it.
- And then....

297
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,366
You will? That was easy.

298
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:28,164
- I thought you were gonna call the cops.
- I am.

299
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,731
I need to make sure the cops get this guy,
so that Michelle's safe.

300
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,675
Listen to me for a minute.

301
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:37,780
Look, I know that you're good
at what you do.

302
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,886
- But that doesn't mean I can't worry.
- That means a lot, Davis.

303
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,445
Just keep your cell on at Luc's show.
I may need you.

304
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,423
Yeah, maybe I'll see you there later.

305
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:50,223
Actually, I wasn't invited.
Don't worry. I'll call you later.

306
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,263
What about that tour?

307
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:01,239
A little personal business. But I'll give you
an orientation later this afternoon.

308
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,701
Tru's a busy girl.

309
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,135
Yeah, she's got a lot of hobbies.

310
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,144
- What's the rush?
- I think it's sweet...

311
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:17,120
that you remembered your three- month
anniversary, but I'm not giving you money.

312
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,749
Why would you think that? Why....

313
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:23,092
Why do reliving days suck for me?

314
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:25,996
So, what did I do?

315
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:28,259
You lost everything I gave you
at the track.

316
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,563
So you're gonna have to be more creative.

317
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,729
And I'm gonna do you
an even bigger favor today.

318
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,568
I'll borrow your car
so you can't go to the track at all.

319
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,266
- No, wait--
- I gotta go.

320
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,107
Go on. Save everybody but me.

321
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,579
I gotta get a job. No.

322
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:47,514
You look a little lost there, bud.
Everything okay?

323
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:51,883
- You'll have to ask my sister.
- You must be Tru's brother.

324
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,084
- I'm Jack, the new guy.
- Harrison. What's up?

325
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,219
You sure everything's okay?

326
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:00,192
Yeah, it's nothing.

327
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:04,198
My girl wanted to go out
for the anniversary, you know.

328
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:08,569
I was gonna take her to a nice dinner,
but I'm all tapped out, so....

329
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:12,110
Well, what do you usually do
to score some quick cash?

330
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:13,643
I bet the horses.

331
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,510
- But I don't even have start- up cash--
- I love the track.

332
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,107
Why don't we go together
and I'll spot you a few bucks?

333
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:22,278
- Get out of here!
- I got some time till orientation. Let's go.

334
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:26,290
Sweet, because if we hurry,
we can still make the daily double.

335
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,547
Check it out.

336
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,655
I need to talk to someone
about a potential robbery.

337
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,698
<i>HoId, pIease.</i>
Come on.

338
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,666
Desk Sergeant Cooper.
How can I help you?

339
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,965
Someone I know
is gonna commit a robbery today.

340
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:41,232
<i>An armed robbery.</i>
Someone you know?

341
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:45,474
- What's your name, miss?
- I'd rather not say.

342
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:48,741
This person you know
give any specifics as to time or place?

343
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:51,647
The Lion's Lair Arcade on Fifth
around 3:00.

344
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,743
Okay, I'll bite.
What does this armed man look like?

345
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,112
No one moves or she dies!

346
00:20:57,189 --> 00:21:00,056
Mid 20s, about 6' tall, short black hair.

347
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:03,526
He wore....I mean, he's wearing
an orange T- shirt under a gray jacket.

348
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,825
Okay, we'll send an officer to check it out.

349
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,592
Thank you. Please hurry.

350
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:29,148
What's up, Frankie?
Give me $20 on the 2 horse.

351
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,755
Two seconds.

352
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:38,419
What's the matter? Second thoughts?

353
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:42,330
I must have lost
when I bet the horse yesterday.

354
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:45,662
What are you talking about?

355
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:49,263
No, Tru told me that I didn't....

356
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,775
I mean, that the horse didn't....

357
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:55,813
The horse won't do well.

358
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:59,281
I've only known Tru
for a short period of time...

359
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:02,013
but she doesn't strike me
as an expert on the ponies.

360
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,883
She's not. She's....

361
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,224
Tru is lucky, man.

362
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:10,459
So am I. So go with me
and bet the 7 horse.

363
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:14,788
- Aidan's Luck?
- Aidan's Luck loves this track.

364
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:16,333
Three- for- three at this distance.

365
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,768
Right.

366
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,538
Forgot about that.

367
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:28,906
Sorry about that.

368
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:33,178
Had to have a quick powwow
with my new consultant over there.

369
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:36,951
Give me $20 on lucky 7, to win.

370
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:55,765
Hand them over. Right now!

371
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:58,833
Everything okay?

372
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:02,071
Fine, sir.
No problem here, Officer.

373
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,081
Can I get some change
for the parking meter?

374
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:08,781
See anything out of the ordinary today?

375
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:11,652
Besides half my clientele? No.

376
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:13,982
Give us a call
if you have any problems.

377
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,186
They must have seen the cops.

378
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,259
Hey, Davis?

379
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,566
You think you'll be able
to make it tonight?

380
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:30,005
- Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
- Great. It's my first show...

381
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,737
and I'm afraid the photos
are gonna outnumber the people.

382
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:35,608
I know that Tru's really excited
about going.

383
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:39,745
She loves photography and photo stuff.

384
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:42,215
Actually, I didn't invite Tru.

385
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:45,889
Really? I had no idea.

386
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:50,358
I thought she's got a lot going on.
I didn't think she'd have the time.

387
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:54,726
Look, I'm no expert
on successful relationships...

388
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:02,172
or any relationship, for that matter.
But let me just say this.

389
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,969
Sometimes people will surprise you.

390
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:08,813
Wh- What?

391
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:15,385
<i>Unit 47, what's your status</i>
<i>on that 2- 11 at the Lion's Lair Arcade?</i>

392
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,422
<i>This is McLain.</i>
<i>That 2- 11's a negative.</i>

393
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:18,786
<i>10- 4.</i>

394
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:22,019
Some nut just called in a false alarm.

395
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,186
The premises were checked.
It's all clear.

396
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,560
<i>AII right, 10- 4.</i>
<i>We got you back in service.</i>

397
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,622
If that woman calls again,
you let her know...

398
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,726
<i>that the faIse reporting of a crime</i>
<i>is a feIony.</i>

399
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,293
<i>WiII do. 10- 4.</i>

400
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,367
What are you up to?

401
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:48,912
The gunman never showed up,
so the robbery never happened.

402
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,547
You altered the day.
He must have cased the place.

403
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,420
Saw the cops and took off. Right.

404
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,017
- There's just one problem.
- The guy's still out there.

405
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:58,153
Right, and his crime spree is still on track.

406
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,357
I have no assurance
that Michelle's gonna be safe.

407
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,923
It might be time
for another anonymous tip.

408
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:05,002
You gonna bail me out
after they lock me up?

409
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,369
Sorry, it's up to me now.
I've gotta head to that second location.

410
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:11,909
- No, it's too dangerous.
- Davis, I can't turn my back on fate.

411
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:15,037
Who knows what could happen?
I have to do this.

412
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:18,947
Okay, but I want you to take this.

413
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:24,717
- A St. Benedict medal.
- It's for protection.

414
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:26,586
Many people believe that it ensures...

415
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:30,059
no harm will come to the body or soul
that possesses it.

416
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:32,528
<i>It was given to me a Iong time ago...</i>

417
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:36,033
and I like to think
that it's kept me safe ever since.

418
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,160
I'm gonna be just fine, D.

419
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:44,069
I hope so.

420
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:48,067
- Hey.
- Hey.

421
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:51,171
- I'm just--
- I know, on your way out the door.

422
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,174
Hey, Tru.

423
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:56,584
I know you're busy
and this is kind of last- minute...

424
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:59,954
but if you get some time tonight,
I'd love for you to come to my show.

425
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:01,652
Thanks. I'll try.

426
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:04,618
- I'll keep my hopes up.
- Bye.

427
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:11,730
Thank you, Aidan's Luck. 2, 3, 4, 5.

428
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,204
And thank you.

429
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,672
I don't know what I would've done
without you.

430
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,436
No, actually, I do.

431
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,779
I wish Tru could see this.

432
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:24,314
Teach her to have a little faith
in her baby bro.

433
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,977
What's with your sister, anyway?
She's a little overprotective of you.

434
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:29,543
She can't help it.

435
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:32,886
You know, ever since our mom died
and the old man bailed...

436
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,983
she kind of looks over the family.

437
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:39,554
Maybe that's why she seems like she has
the weight of the world on her shoulders.

438
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,733
Yeah, she's got
a lot of other stuff going on.

439
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,165
Like what?

440
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:48,295
More than you could imagine, my friend.

441
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:50,670
I got a pretty big imagination.

442
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:53,908
Well, she's...

443
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:56,906
She's one- of- a- kind. But enough about her.

444
00:26:56,982 --> 00:27:00,179
More importantly,
who do you like in the next race?

445
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:03,177
You're not gonna like it.

446
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:05,455
Deep Shaker.

447
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:08,191
What? He's 20- to- 1.

448
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:11,695
He likes the outside on a dry track.
Could be his day.

449
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:16,166
And if you win this bet, you'll have
enough money for six anniversary dinners.

450
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:20,002
Deep Shaker?

451
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:21,805
$20 to win.

452
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:46,425
Don't do it.
I know what you're gonna do.

453
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,296
You're gonna grab someone
and try and hold this place up.

454
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:52,165
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Listen.

455
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:55,695
You haven't done anything yet.
Didn't hit the arcade because of the cops.

456
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:58,742
- Stop before someone gets hurt, or worse.
- Who are you?

457
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:01,244
Does it matter?
Get out of my way.

458
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,781
Don't go out there.
The guy that just left has got a gun.

459
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:12,414
- Sorry, but I'm in a rush.
- Didn't you hear what I said?

460
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:36,344
<i>Morgue.</i>
Davis, you're not gonna believe this.

461
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:38,473
Honestly, nothing at this point
surprises me.

462
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,986
He tried to hit the clothing store.
I stopped the robbery but he escaped.

463
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:45,022
<i>What about the hostage?</i>
<i>That's just it. There isn't one.</i>

464
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:49,049
He isn't taking a different hostage each
time. It's the same girl at every location.

465
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,186
- They're a team.
- Just like Bonnie and Clyde.

466
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:54,698
Kind of, except in this case,
Clyde uses Bonnie as a fake hostage.

467
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,358
That's an interesting twist.

468
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:59,631
I should've known when he took her
from the diner after she got shot.

469
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:01,968
She wasn't a shield.
He wouldn't leave her because--

470
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,132
<i>They're in it together.</i>
Right.

471
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,176
You've been busy today.

472
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:10,346
- Feel like telling me what's going on?
- Michelle.

473
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:13,247
I see we don't need to be
formally introduced...

474
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:15,843
- even though I haven't met you.
- I recognize your voice.

475
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,944
Really?

476
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:19,216
You've harassed my phone machine
enough times.

477
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,315
If you'd just talk to me,
maybe I'd stop.

478
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:23,724
<i>Today's not the day.</i>
<i>It's the perfect day.</i>

479
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:27,697
You're calling in false alarms,
chasing people out of clothing stores.

480
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,667
Just another typical day
in the life of Tru Davies.

481
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:34,728
I checked police logs, auto track records.
Your name pops up everywhere. In fact--

482
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:35,806
Michelle.

483
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:39,435
You don't want to be around me today.

484
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:44,139
I want your answers, Tru.
I'm not going anywhere until I get them.

485
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:50,483
- Okay, meet me tonight.
- Time and place?

486
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:55,089
8:00 sharp at the morgue.

487
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,527
Just please promise me
you'll wait until I get there?

488
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,220
I'll be there.

489
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:03,690
And this better be good.

490
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:06,533
Believe me, it's good.

491
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,204
Did you get all that?
<i>Yeah.</i>

492
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:14,709
She'll be at the morgue at 8:00.
Make sure she waits until I get there.

493
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:16,474
That way, we can ensure she stays alive.

494
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:19,379
Even if she isn't at the diner,
someone could still get hurt.

495
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,918
It's my job.
It's a chance we're gonna have to take.

496
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,783
<i>I'II caII you Iater.</i>

497
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:28,516
- Did I hear someone mention the diner?
- No, I was talking to Tru.

498
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:31,687
Is she getting takeout?
'Cause I could really use a burger.

499
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,822
No, she has her hands full.

500
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:43,263
Before we got there,
I'm thinking to myself...

501
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,571
it's gonna be canned soup
and crackers for us.

502
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:49,010
Jack, he's turned me in the direction
of this long shot.

503
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,072
I'm a little dubious, mind you,
but Jack said:

504
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:55,812
"If this horse wins,
you can buy six anniversary dinners."

505
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:59,287
Are you gonna eat the rest of this?

506
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,419
Deep Shaker
was a 20- to- 1 shot.

507
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:07,759
But Jack had a feeling.
And boy, did he ever have a feeling!

508
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:10,196
I'm talking about $400 worth of feelings.

509
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:14,830
I have an idea. Why don't I leave
so you can have dinner with Jack?

510
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,298
What?

511
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,372
Never mind.

512
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:21,934
What a day, what a night, and it ain't over.

513
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,981
Where are you going, chief?

514
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,546
For your little lady.
Thank you, sir.

515
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:30,780
No, you ought to thank Jack.

516
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:46,592
Drop the gun!

517
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,266
Everyone shut up!

518
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,517
You're a policeman, right?

519
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,758
I'm off-duty, ma'am.
Is there something I can do for you?

520
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,463
I hope so.

521
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,136
Hello?

522
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,243
Hello?

523
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,107
Can I help you?

524
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:38,147
Hi, I didn't see you there.

525
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,917
Michelle Carey, <i>Post Dispatch.</i>

526
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:43,358
Sorry, I subscribe to the <i>Times.</i>

527
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:47,055
I'm not peddling subscriptions.
I'm looking for Tru Davies.

528
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,692
Yeah. Davis said she's at
the Standard Diner down the block.

529
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:53,328
Really? She's supposed to meet me
here at 8:00.

530
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:56,100
- I'm sure she's on her way back.
- I'm not.

531
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:58,005
Why don't you just pop in on her?

532
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:00,634
It's just out the door,
two blocks down on your right.

533
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:02,679
Thanks. I think I will.

534
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:17,026
I don't know who tipped you off...

535
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:19,723
but I don't see
the blonde woman you described...

536
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:22,493
let alone some guy holding up the place.

537
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:25,559
I don't understand.
They should be here by now.

538
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,070
Things couldn't have changed that much.

539
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:30,738
I can't believe you're not gonna do this.

540
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:34,505
That girl knew we were gonna be
at the arcade and the clothing store.

541
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:38,048
- It was a coincidence. Bad luck.
- She knows we're together.

542
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:40,049
She has no idea who we are...

543
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:44,077
and there's no way in hell
she knows we're gonna hit this diner.

544
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:48,885
- Unless you talked to somebody, Charlie.
- You think I'm nuts?

545
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:51,484
Why would I tell anyone
about this?

546
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:54,358
Look, this is getting out of hand, Beth.

547
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,492
This was supposed to be
just the two of us having a few kicks...

548
00:33:57,568 --> 00:34:00,196
grabbing some quick dough
without anyone getting hurt.

549
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:01,465
Who's gotten hurt, Charlie?

550
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,769
- No one, but--
- Exactly. No one.

551
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:10,146
We promised each other
that the minute there was any trouble...

552
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:13,877
- we're gonna back off.
- Meanwhile, we haven't seen a dime.

553
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:17,588
As for kicks,
we haven't got much there, either.

554
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:27,126
Later, hon.
Sorry, but you're gonna miss all the fun.

555
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:29,255
Beth!

556
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,223
Beth!

557
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:39,342
Looks like your friend gave you
a bogus tip.

558
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:43,105
- It wouldn't be the first time.
- Sorry to have troubled you.

559
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:45,249
Better to be safe than sorry.

560
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:50,453
You leaving already? Because
if you'd like to join me for dinner....

561
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:54,218
Sorry, but I've got another crisis
waiting for me back at the office.

562
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:57,227
And unfortunately,
this one's gonna show up.

563
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:17,408
Did a reporter come here looking for Tru?
Long dark hair, mid- to- late 20s?

564
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:20,451
Yeah, Michelle something.
About 10 minutes ago.

565
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:23,714
I told her Tru was at the diner
and she took off.

566
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,123
8:00 at the morgue?

567
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:36,391
- I was just gonna pick up some dinner.
- Eating light?

568
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:41,532
Look, you can't even begin to understand
what's been going on today.

569
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:44,435
Oh, no.

570
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:48,070
- Wait right here. I'll be right back.
- Like that's gonna happen.

571
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:51,114
Wait for me at the morgue.
It's for your own good, believe me.

572
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:53,082
Okay, but you better show.

573
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:55,378
Give me the money right now!

574
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,211
Don't do this.

575
00:35:58,656 --> 00:35:59,714
You.

576
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,925
Police officer! Drop the gun!

577
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:07,256
I don't know what you're doing here,
but just shut up!

578
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,095
- Get in the booth.
- It's not gonna end well.

579
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,226
Now!

580
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,895
All right, let's have it right now.

581
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,103
Drop it right now!
Hurry up!

582
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:22,805
Put the gun down
and no one gets hurt.

583
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,117
All right.

584
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,448
I leave, she lives. Simple as that.

585
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:35,016
No one's been hurt yet
but that could change.

586
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:37,822
In fact, I could almost guarantee
it's going to.

587
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:39,692
Just let it go, miss.

588
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:44,289
- What if she gets shot? What if she dies?
- Just shut up!

589
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,937
Everyone knows what you look like.

590
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:52,768
You'll end up alone in prison for the rest
of your life. Is that what you want?

591
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:55,373
No, she doesn't.

592
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,977
Please, Beth. You gotta stop.

593
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:05,819
We never wanted to hurt anyone.

594
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:08,657
<i>This isn't what we do.</i>

595
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:10,789
We're not criminals.

596
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,189
We're not even good at it.

597
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:20,093
How else could
she have been on to us all day?

598
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,866
<i>And if she is...</i>

599
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:28,069
- the cops can't be far behind.
- Actually, there's one right there.

600
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:34,178
Beth, please, let this woman go.

601
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,738
Put down the gun and kick it to me.

602
00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:59,132
Drop the gun!

603
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,447
Over here.

604
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:17,589
Police! Put the gun down!
I'm from 64 Precinct.

605
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:19,425
Badge number 83049.

606
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:21,754
Police!

607
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:23,991
How'd you get here
so quick?

608
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:27,799
Got a 91 1 call from the Coroner's Office
about a holdup in progress.

609
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,670
<i>Said he was worried about his friend here.</i>

610
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,905
So, Harrison spent a fortune on dinner.

611
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:40,483
<i>He did?</i>
Yep.

612
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:45,615
He also spent the entire evening talking
about his new track buddy named Jack.

613
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:46,748
No kidding?

614
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:49,884
<i>Why do I feeI</i>
<i>if a coupIe of Iong shots hadn't come in...</i>

615
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,258
I would've had frozen pizza
instead of a soufflé?

616
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,265
I won't try and convince you otherwise.
You gonna be all right?

617
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,393
- Yeah. Ask me in the morning.
- Okay, good night.

618
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,930
I think you owe me an explanation.

619
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,371
God, I've had it with you!

620
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:07,535
It's not enough
I just saved your ungrateful....

621
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:13,050
- Okay, you want the truth?
- That's all I ever wanted.

622
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,209
Turn on that tape recorder.

623
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:18,622
Yesterday, I went to the diner.

624
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:21,123
You were following me,
just like you did today.

625
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,684
- Yesterday? I didn't go--
- You want to hear this or not?

626
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:29,225
There was a holdup at the diner.
You were shot and killed.

627
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,468
After you died, you asked for my help.

628
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,664
The day rewound,
and now I'm reliving yesterday.

629
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,466
What?

630
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:41,534
In order to keep you from dying,
I had to try and prevent a crime spree...

631
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:45,081
which you tipped me off on yesterday.
And thanks for that, by the way.

632
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:48,676
But you ended up at the diner anyway,
because that's how fate wanted it.

633
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:52,052
So now you want me to think
you're just plain nuts?

634
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,715
Nice try, but it's not gonna work.

635
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,754
I don't know
exactly what happened back there...

636
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,189
but you and I aren't done.

637
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:15,138
Luc, hey.

638
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:16,502
Yeah.

639
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:19,447
Your show. I wanted to be there.
I really did.

640
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:23,419
- It's just my day wouldn't end.
- Tru, you don't have to explain.

641
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:27,548
I invited you because I wanted you there,
not because I thought you would be.

642
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,286
It's okay, really.

643
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:33,025
Well, how did it go?

644
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:36,696
Pretty good. Had a decent turnout.

645
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:38,828
Sold two prints.

646
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:43,073
- It was a good night for me.
- That's good. I'm glad.

647
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:49,737
You know, I thought for a while
that maybe I could change our fate...

648
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:54,575
but I guess fate's one thing
you just can't change.

649
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:09,431
Thank God.
It's okay, Davis. I'm in one piece.

650
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,832
And Michelle lives to see another day.

651
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:15,463
I'll reserve judgment
whether that's a good thing or not.

652
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:18,264
So did the medallion keep you safe?

653
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:23,980
No, Davis. It was you who kept me safe.
You called the police.

654
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:30,251
It's the least I could do
after letting Michelle out of my sight.

655
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,414
Anyway, thanks.
No.

656
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:34,217
No, that's, uh...

657
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,657
That's yours to keep.

658
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:40,121
I appreciate it. Thanks, D.

659
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,320
Yeah.

660
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,199
One thing.

661
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:51,505
I'm in danger all the time.
I mean, dodging bullets, chasing bad guys.

662
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:55,307
But today, the medallion,
making me call the police.

663
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:58,108
Why were you so worried about me today?

664
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,983
Well, for one, there was Michelle.
But the truth is...

665
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:06,086
I worry about you every day, Tru.

666
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:08,990
Today I just wanted to help.

667
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:23,337
You have a fun day at the races?

668
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:27,473
Actually, we did.
Your brother's a pretty cool guy.

669
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:29,612
I happen to think so, too.

670
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:33,547
Just not sure why you had to go
to the track to figure that out.

671
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:35,050
Don't worry so much.

672
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,316
Harrison's a big boy.
He can take care of himself.

673
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,051
Besides, he won, didn't he?

674
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:45,391
Well, I'm his sister.

675
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:49,759
I know Harrison a lot better than you do
and what's best for him.

676
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:51,764
Maybe so.

677
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,631
<i>But you know what?</i>

678
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,000
You can't take care of everyone, Tru.

679
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:05,040
That isn't gonna stop me from trying.
