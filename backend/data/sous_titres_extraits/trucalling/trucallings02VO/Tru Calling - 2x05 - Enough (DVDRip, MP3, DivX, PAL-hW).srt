1
00:00:02,813 --> 00:00:04,405
Break.

2
00:00:06,293 --> 00:00:09,569
Red dog, right! Red dog, right!

3
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:12,449
- Twenty-six!
- Come on.

4
00:00:12,653 --> 00:00:15,213
Hut, hut, hut, hike.

5
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,127
Gotcha.

6
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:26,043
Nice. Bring it in strong.
Nicely done. Nice hands, Davies.

7
00:00:26,253 --> 00:00:27,572
Thanks. Nice throw.

8
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:29,644
You two,
all day with the compliments.

9
00:00:29,813 --> 00:00:32,008
Nothing wrong
with positive reinforcement.

10
00:00:32,173 --> 00:00:35,483
Ah, yes. I'm sure that Montana
always got all starry-eyed...

11
00:00:35,693 --> 00:00:37,251
...every time Rice hauled one in.

12
00:00:37,453 --> 00:00:39,887
Kind of hard to tell
with the helmets and everything.

13
00:00:40,053 --> 00:00:42,203
Okay, 48 red. Break.

14
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:47,283
Forty-eight red.

15
00:00:48,813 --> 00:00:50,531
Hut, hut, hike!

16
00:00:51,493 --> 00:00:52,892
- Whoa. Whoa.
- Ah!

17
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,771
- Are you okay?
- Ow.

18
00:00:54,973 --> 00:00:56,770
- Penalty.
- I think I did something to my wrist.

19
00:00:56,933 --> 00:00:58,571
Let me see. Let me see.

21
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:04,971
Well, it's not broken.

22
00:01:05,173 --> 00:01:08,006
You know, you may have sprained
your radial carpal ligament.

23
00:01:08,213 --> 00:01:11,569
Oh, check you out. That's good for
somebody who's just auditing med class.

24
00:01:11,773 --> 00:01:13,923
Maybe you should sub out,
put some ice on it.

25
00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:16,772
With just 10 short yards
between us and intramural glory?

26
00:01:16,973 --> 00:01:19,806
- Not a chance. Let's do it.
- All right, tough guy.

27
00:01:20,453 --> 00:01:25,208
Nice win, kids. Don't forget,
cram session later, the cadaver lab.

28
00:01:25,413 --> 00:01:29,247
Nobody leaves till we make
the endocrine system our bitch.

29
00:01:29,573 --> 00:01:32,724
- Oh, I'm gonna be late for work.
- I'm heading that way. Want company?

30
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:35,049
- Yeah.
- All right.

31
00:01:37,493 --> 00:01:39,848
You swear you've never played
flag football before today?

32
00:01:40,053 --> 00:01:42,328
- It was my professional debut.
- You're a natural.

33
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:46,287
And a hell of an upgrade over Tyler.
I swear this guy's got hands like stone.

34
00:01:46,493 --> 00:01:47,767
- Tru?
- That bag.

35
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:49,571
- What?
- It's just like the one...

36
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:51,212
...Dr. Kendall used to have.

37
00:01:51,413 --> 00:01:53,244
Our family doctor
back when I was a kid.

38
00:01:53,453 --> 00:01:56,411
Whenever he made a house call,
he used to bring a bag like that.

39
00:01:56,613 --> 00:02:00,049
- You knew a doctor that did house calls?
- Oh, he was the sweetest guy ever.

40
00:02:00,213 --> 00:02:02,852
He was the first person who told me
I should be a doctor.

41
00:02:03,013 --> 00:02:04,287
You should buy it.

42
00:02:04,493 --> 00:02:06,848
I'm not a doctor.
I'm not even a real med student.

43
00:02:07,053 --> 00:02:09,044
Yeah, but you will be, right?

44
00:02:10,093 --> 00:02:12,971
Come on. Davis is probably
wondering where I am.

46
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:19,765
- Ow.
- Are you sure you don't want me...

47
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:21,446
...to put some ice on that wrist?

48
00:02:21,653 --> 00:02:23,883
Yeah, thanks anyway.
I'm gonna run to the clinic.

49
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:26,527
Doing some volunteering this afternoon,
so I'll get some there.

50
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:28,331
Oh.

51
00:02:28,493 --> 00:02:30,324
Hey, Tru, is that you?

52
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:32,842
- Uh, yeah.
- Oh, hi. Hi, Jensen.

53
00:02:33,013 --> 00:02:34,605
Hey. Hey, Davis.

54
00:02:34,773 --> 00:02:38,891
Uh, so I'Il... I will, uh... I'll see you
at the cram session tonight.

55
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:40,651
Yeah, you will.

56
00:02:40,853 --> 00:02:43,287
- See you later, man.
- Bye.

57
00:02:44,973 --> 00:02:47,168
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
that you two were...

58
00:02:47,373 --> 00:02:48,647
That's okay. Nothing happened.

60
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,369
Of course nothing happened,
because I walked in...

61
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:55,406
...at the worst possible time,
which is my greatest talent.

62
00:02:55,893 --> 00:02:59,727
Hey, uh, Davis, can I ask you
kind of a personal question?

63
00:03:00,053 --> 00:03:01,725
Yeah, go ahead.

64
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:07,963
Well, after your wife died, um, how long
was it before you...? You know...?

65
00:03:08,413 --> 00:03:10,131
Starting dating?

66
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,801
- Uh, four years.
- Oh.

67
00:03:13,013 --> 00:03:17,165
But that had more to do with
social deficiencies than anything else.

68
00:03:17,653 --> 00:03:20,725
Look, I know it's been a few months
since Luc died, but you know...

69
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:24,369
...if you're starting to have feelings
about someone, you should accept it.

70
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:27,573
It just... It feels soon, is all.

71
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:30,162
Well, it's always gonna feel soon,
whether it's today...

72
00:03:30,373 --> 00:03:32,841
...or tomorrow
or four years from now.

73
00:03:33,253 --> 00:03:35,289
Well, how do you know
when you're ready?

74
00:03:36,053 --> 00:03:38,044
You fall in love again.

75
00:04:04,093 --> 00:04:05,367
Freeze. No one move.

76
00:04:13,373 --> 00:04:15,489
Help me, Tru.

77
00:04:15,973 --> 00:04:17,611
Please tell me...

78
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,402
Please tell me that you can fix this.

79
00:04:21,613 --> 00:04:23,285
Ooh, what happened?

80
00:04:24,573 --> 00:04:26,086
Uh...

81
00:04:26,293 --> 00:04:29,012
Well, Dad made some comment
the other day about my hair.

82
00:04:29,213 --> 00:04:33,126
He said, uh, "You look a little scruffy
to be an employee of a law firm."

83
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,767
So I said, "Hey, why don't I make
the old man happy...

84
00:04:35,973 --> 00:04:38,362
...get a real haircut for once."

85
00:04:39,253 --> 00:04:41,562
You can't get one of those
for less than 6 bucks.

86
00:04:41,773 --> 00:04:45,322
Come on, Tru. You're a girl,
you read all those fashion magazines.

87
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:47,888
There's gotta be something
you can do, Tru.

88
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:49,884
Uh...

89
00:04:54,933 --> 00:04:56,491
There. It's perfect.

90
00:04:57,533 --> 00:04:58,966
There's a new suit?

91
00:04:59,973 --> 00:05:01,770
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

92
00:05:01,973 --> 00:05:04,567
I say, you know, what the hell,
might as well go all out.

93
00:05:04,773 --> 00:05:06,764
Get myself some new threads.
Do you like?

94
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,131
It's very professional.

95
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:14,283
No, let's not kid ourselves, shall we?

96
00:05:14,493 --> 00:05:19,442
We both know what they call a guy
like me wearing a suit like that.

97
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,087
- The defendant.
- Oh, come on, Harry. You're not...

98
00:05:22,293 --> 00:05:24,727
I was crazy to think I could change.

99
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:27,493
I can't change who I am.
Let's face it, okay?

100
00:05:27,653 --> 00:05:31,043
Hey, you can change.
You changed your hair.

101
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,164
- I'm just saying.
- Watch yourself.

102
00:05:34,373 --> 00:05:35,886
Not now.

103
00:05:36,973 --> 00:05:38,770
Listen, I gotta go.

104
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:42,124
- Thanks for the hat.
- Totally. You're welcome. Bye, Harr.

105
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:46,163
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

106
00:05:46,373 --> 00:05:48,933
Not funny. It's not funny.

110
00:05:58,613 --> 00:06:02,242
Harrison, you forgot your...

111
00:06:03,813 --> 00:06:05,724
Avery, what's wrong?

112
00:06:06,613 --> 00:06:08,251
He's dead.

113
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:11,203
What? Who's dead?

114
00:06:13,253 --> 00:06:14,527
Jensen.

115
00:06:17,573 --> 00:06:19,529
Jensen's dead.

116
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:38,486
Help me.

117
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:06,969
- Tru, I'm... I'm so sorry.
- I'm not here for condolences, Davis.

118
00:07:07,173 --> 00:07:08,492
I'm here to fix this.

119
00:07:09,293 --> 00:07:11,761
Please, before he asks, tell me
what I need to know to save him.

120
00:07:12,253 --> 00:07:16,246
Okay. According to the police report,
there was a holdup...

121
00:07:16,453 --> 00:07:19,172
...and Jensen got in the way.

122
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:22,046
He was shot once in the chest
at approximately 5:30...

123
00:07:22,253 --> 00:07:24,084
...and he died en route to the hospital.

124
00:07:24,293 --> 00:07:26,170
Where was the holdup?

125
00:07:26,773 --> 00:07:29,003
A consignment store on West Broadway.

126
00:07:30,213 --> 00:07:32,010
<i>He went back for the bag.</i>

127
00:07:32,613 --> 00:07:35,366
There was this doctor's bag
in the window...

128
00:07:35,573 --> 00:07:39,009
...and he knew that I liked it,
so he must have gone back for it.

129
00:07:39,853 --> 00:07:41,764
I guess I should've
seen this coming, huh?

130
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,483
How could you possibly
see this coming?

131
00:07:44,693 --> 00:07:46,763
Typhoid Mary, remember?

132
00:07:48,213 --> 00:07:50,329
Everyone I care about gets hurt.

133
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:53,331
Everyone I love is in danger
just for knowing me.

134
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:55,205
- You're wrong about that.
- Really?

135
00:07:55,413 --> 00:07:57,802
Because my track record
says otherwise.

136
00:07:58,013 --> 00:08:00,732
In the past four months,
I lost Luc and Jensen.

137
00:08:00,893 --> 00:08:03,361
- Even Harrison died once.
- Yeah, but you saved him.

138
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:06,491
All that means is I'm one for three
when it comes to people I care about.

139
00:08:06,973 --> 00:08:09,612
Tru? Davis told me the news.

140
00:08:09,813 --> 00:08:13,044
I just wanted to let you know
how terribly sorry I am.

141
00:08:13,653 --> 00:08:18,204
She's a grief counselor. I thought
maybe you would like to talk to her.

142
00:08:18,413 --> 00:08:21,291
- We could go up to my office.
- I'm not going anywhere.

143
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,607
Not when he needs me.

144
00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:27,411
Maybe we should talk outside.

145
00:08:27,613 --> 00:08:29,046
Okay.

146
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:35,884
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

147
00:08:36,093 --> 00:08:39,972
No, you were right to call me.
She's clearly in denial over his death.

148
00:08:40,173 --> 00:08:42,733
Yeah, but still,
we should give her some time.

149
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:46,770
Okay. Whatever you think.

150
00:08:47,013 --> 00:08:50,528
- Hey. I'll be upstairs if you need me.
- Okay.

151
00:08:58,013 --> 00:09:02,052
- It's Jack.
- It's me. I've got news.

152
00:09:04,013 --> 00:09:05,765
How long has she been in there?

153
00:09:06,173 --> 00:09:07,731
Four hours.

154
00:09:08,373 --> 00:09:13,493
I should go. Jensen's parents' plane
lands in 30 minutes.

155
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:19,804
Gosh, you should've seen me earlier
when I called them to break the news.

156
00:09:20,013 --> 00:09:22,163
I couldn't stop crying.

158
00:09:25,013 --> 00:09:27,322
Some doctor I'm gonna be.

159
00:09:27,773 --> 00:09:31,686
I can't even talk about death
without completely losing it.

160
00:09:31,973 --> 00:09:34,248
I wish I could tell you it gets easier.

161
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:39,410
I'd better go, um...

162
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:43,006
- Take care of her.
- Yep.

163
00:09:52,373 --> 00:09:54,364
Hey, I was thinking,
if you were hungry...

164
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:56,882
...maybe you'd like
to go down to the diner.

165
00:09:58,053 --> 00:10:00,203
Not now, no.

166
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:03,211
- I've got things to do.
- Are you leaving?

167
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:05,529
It's been four hours
and Jensen hasn't asked for help.

168
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:09,169
Neither have any of the other bodies.
So it's time to face the facts.

169
00:10:09,373 --> 00:10:12,410
If I want the day to restart,
I have to find some new dead people.

170
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:15,002
- How do you plan on doing...?
- Last time I checked...

171
00:10:15,213 --> 00:10:18,330
...there were five other morgues.
I'll jog to every one if I have to.

172
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:21,127
- Yeah, but, Tru...
- I'm not gonna lose him, Davis.

173
00:10:34,693 --> 00:10:38,527
Hi. Um, takeout for Davis, please?

174
00:10:40,293 --> 00:10:42,887
That was fast. Thank you.

175
00:10:44,093 --> 00:10:47,244
Word has it our girl hit every morgue
in a 20-mile radius tonight.

176
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,404
No need to fabricate a story, Davis.

177
00:10:49,613 --> 00:10:53,492
I know about Jensen, and I know
exactly what she's trying to do.

178
00:10:53,693 --> 00:10:57,572
The poor girl just doesn't have any luck
with boyfriends, now does she?

179
00:10:57,733 --> 00:10:59,166
Yeah, thanks to you.

180
00:10:59,373 --> 00:11:03,332
Oh, the Luc thing.
Yeah, that was my fault. I admit it.

181
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:06,491
But Jensen,
that's fate sending a message.

182
00:11:06,693 --> 00:11:10,572
Well, lucky for him,
Tru has a knack for changing fate.

183
00:11:10,773 --> 00:11:13,162
It's different this time.
She's not God, Davis.

184
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:16,012
She can't pick and choose
the people that she wants to save.

185
00:11:16,213 --> 00:11:18,727
- They have to choose her.
- Why are you telling me this?

186
00:11:18,933 --> 00:11:22,403
Two reasons. First and foremost,
I happen to think you agree with me.

187
00:11:22,613 --> 00:11:24,808
Deep down inside, you know
what she's doing is wrong...

188
00:11:25,013 --> 00:11:26,810
...but you're too damn loyal
to say anything.

189
00:11:27,013 --> 00:11:31,165
Second, she won't listen to a word
I say, but she might listen to you.

190
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:35,326
You are right about one thing.
I am... I am loyal to Tru.

191
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:39,082
And if she needs help saving Jensen,
then she'll get it.

192
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,809
Fine. Just don't say I didn't warn you.

195
00:12:08,093 --> 00:12:10,891
I know I can help you. I just...

196
00:12:11,693 --> 00:12:14,161
I need a little more time.

198
00:12:18,053 --> 00:12:19,964
Any luck at the other morgues?

199
00:12:21,093 --> 00:12:22,572
I'm sorry.

200
00:12:23,773 --> 00:12:26,810
- You're tired. You should go home.
- I can't.

201
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,731
Not until a body asks for help.

202
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:31,367
Tru, that could take days,
or even weeks.

203
00:12:31,573 --> 00:12:33,006
I can wait.

204
00:12:33,613 --> 00:12:36,252
Well, maybe you shouldn't.

205
00:12:37,013 --> 00:12:38,969
- What?
- Look, I know you care for Jensen.

206
00:12:39,453 --> 00:12:41,683
But the fact is,
is that he didn't ask for help.

207
00:12:41,853 --> 00:12:43,650
Maybe we should assume
there's a reason why.

208
00:12:43,853 --> 00:12:46,651
I don't care if there's a reason.
I can help him, and I will.

209
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:48,844
Maybe you're not supposed to,
you know?

210
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:52,728
Maybe it's a violation of some rule.
Aren't you worried about consequences?

211
00:12:52,893 --> 00:12:55,282
I don't know about you,
but I didn't get a rulebook.

212
00:12:55,493 --> 00:12:59,486
I didn't get a rulebook either, but that
doesn't mean there aren't rules, Tru.

214
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:07,091
City Morgue.

215
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:09,888
Yes. Okay.

216
00:13:10,293 --> 00:13:13,251
- Someone just called for a pickup?
- Yes, Third and Ogden.

217
00:13:14,853 --> 00:13:16,969
I know that it's difficult...

218
00:13:17,173 --> 00:13:20,006
...especially with someone
with your abilities...

219
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:23,125
...but maybe you have to accept
the fact you can't help Jensen.

220
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:27,572
Is that what your favorite grief counselor
told you, that I'm in denial?

221
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:29,451
Well, she's right.

222
00:13:29,653 --> 00:13:35,250
I am in denial. I deny this.
And you know what? I can.

223
00:13:35,413 --> 00:13:37,563
Excuse me, I have a pickup.

224
00:13:48,573 --> 00:13:49,847
The deceased escaped...

225
00:13:50,013 --> 00:13:51,605
...from a work detail
at 11:30 this morning.

226
00:13:52,053 --> 00:13:53,486
- He was a prisoner?
- Yeah.

227
00:13:53,693 --> 00:13:56,969
He was doing the roadside work
on Route 101 when he busted loose.

228
00:13:57,173 --> 00:14:02,008
Used a fork to unlock the monitoring
device on his ankle, and took off.

229
00:14:02,373 --> 00:14:04,045
We lost him for a couple of hours...

230
00:14:04,253 --> 00:14:07,450
...then he stole this SUV,
and a chase ensued.

231
00:14:08,293 --> 00:14:11,205
I guess we know how that ended.
Was anyone else hurt?

232
00:14:11,693 --> 00:14:15,049
The dinner rush hadn't started yet,
so the patio was empty. Thank God.

233
00:14:15,253 --> 00:14:17,483
He was the only casualty?

234
00:14:17,893 --> 00:14:20,532
Now he's all yours. Enjoy.

235
00:14:25,373 --> 00:14:28,729
Tru, look, l...
I know that you're angry.

236
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:32,687
But if this body asks for help
and your day restarts...

237
00:14:32,893 --> 00:14:35,282
...promise me you won't forget
what we talked about.

238
00:14:36,053 --> 00:14:38,692
Don't worry, Davis, I won't forget.

239
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,327
Come on, please.

240
00:15:01,573 --> 00:15:02,892
Save me.

241
00:15:11,853 --> 00:15:13,525
Now, that's more like it.

243
00:15:21,693 --> 00:15:23,012
- Hello?
- It's me.

244
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:26,125
You're lucky you caught me.
I was on my way to the morgue.

245
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,164
Good. I've got
an assignment for you.

246
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:31,612
Please tell me they caught the guy
that did this to Jensen.

247
00:15:31,813 --> 00:15:34,122
- This is gonna be a tough one.
- Tell me about it.

248
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:39,168
Okay. Two bodies, two "help me's,"
two totally unrelated deaths.

249
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:41,284
Guess we've got our work
cut out for us.

250
00:15:41,493 --> 00:15:44,405
How did it happen? Did one body
ask for help and then the other?

251
00:15:44,613 --> 00:15:48,731
- Did they ask at the same time?
- Same time. It was like in stereo.

252
00:15:49,413 --> 00:15:52,166
By the way, I'm sorry about Jensen.
I know you two were getting close.

253
00:15:52,373 --> 00:15:55,171
Look, he's still alive, Davis,
and I am gonna save him today.

254
00:15:55,373 --> 00:15:58,445
Oh, I know, I know. I'm gonna
make sure that that prisoner...

255
00:15:58,653 --> 00:16:00,291
...doesn't escape that work detail.

256
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:02,768
Actually, I was gonna hand the prisoner
off to Harrison.

257
00:16:02,973 --> 00:16:04,964
Foiling the escape means talking
to police.

258
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:07,931
Harrison's got a little more experience
in that department.

259
00:16:09,053 --> 00:16:11,169
- Well, all right.
- While I'm with Jensen...

260
00:16:11,373 --> 00:16:13,933
...find a way to close the consignment
store where he was killed.

261
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:17,449
Right. Make sure the store's not held up
so no innocent lives are in jeopardy.

262
00:16:17,653 --> 00:16:19,530
- Thanks, Davis.
- Is that it?

263
00:16:19,893 --> 00:16:23,488
That's it. If I need anything else,
I'll call you.

264
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:26,049
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

265
00:16:26,373 --> 00:16:29,490
Hi. Wow, where's she off to
in such a hurry?

266
00:16:29,693 --> 00:16:33,208
Um, she's gonna go play flag football
at the park.

267
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:35,881
She's, uh, quite the athlete.

269
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:43,724
- Yo.
- Harry, I need your help.

270
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:45,730
<i>Can it wait?</i>
<i>I'm about to get a haircut.</i>

271
00:16:45,893 --> 00:16:49,090
Just because Dad called you scruffy
doesn't mean you're due for a makeover.

272
00:16:49,253 --> 00:16:51,721
- So I take it someone's day restarted?
- Sure did.

273
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:54,083
- The haircut?
- Does not end well.

274
00:16:56,533 --> 00:16:58,888
- <i>So, what do you need?</i>
- A prisoner's gonna escape...

275
00:16:59,093 --> 00:17:01,049
...on Route 101
in less than an hour.

276
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:04,928
Later today, he dies in a car crash after
a whole big car chase with the cops.

277
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:06,407
Unless I put a whammy on it.

278
00:17:06,613 --> 00:17:09,127
One problem. I never got his name.
I need you to point him out.

279
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,563
How do I do that
without looking suspicious?

280
00:17:13,573 --> 00:17:17,646
<i>- Tru? Hey, Tru, are you there?</i>
- You'll think of something.

281
00:17:17,853 --> 00:17:20,651
Just give me a description.
I'll see what I can do.

282
00:17:21,013 --> 00:17:22,571
Break.

283
00:17:24,413 --> 00:17:26,722
Forty-eight red!

284
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,132
Forty-eight red! Hut, hut, hike!

287
00:17:35,893 --> 00:17:37,167
Sorry. Adrenaline.

288
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,971
You're out one play.

289
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:41,888
Remind me never to piss her off, huh?

291
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:54,130
That was nice, Davies.
Didn't know you had it in you.

292
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:58,611
Sometimes you gotta fight dirty to win.
You, of all people, should know that.

293
00:17:58,813 --> 00:18:00,405
Let's cut to the chase, shall we?

294
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:03,525
You're planning to save Jensen.
I'm here to talk you out of it.

295
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:06,725
Considering you only see the lives
of people who ask me for help...

296
00:18:06,893 --> 00:18:09,327
...how'd you know he died?
- Oh, there's plenty of ways...

297
00:18:09,493 --> 00:18:13,122
...to find out about a murder. Watch
the news, listen to the police scanner.

298
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,607
I relive days too.

299
00:18:14,813 --> 00:18:18,692
You can save the speech
about preserving fate. I've heard it.

300
00:18:18,893 --> 00:18:21,248
It's bad enough you save people
that do ask for help.

301
00:18:21,413 --> 00:18:23,085
But saving people that don't?

302
00:18:23,253 --> 00:18:25,926
You're taking things
to an entirely new level of bad.

303
00:18:26,133 --> 00:18:29,489
This from a man who pushed a woman
with leukemia off a building.

304
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:33,049
There's a bigger picture here, Tru.
We may be on opposite sides...

305
00:18:33,253 --> 00:18:35,244
...but each side has its rules.

306
00:18:35,453 --> 00:18:38,445
You break those rules,
and the repercussions will be severe.

307
00:18:38,653 --> 00:18:41,611
Not just for you, but for Jensen.

308
00:18:41,813 --> 00:18:44,168
- Is that a threat?
- It's a guarantee.

309
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:47,645
Believe it or not,
I'm trying to do you a favor.

310
00:18:47,853 --> 00:18:51,528
Let me put his death back on track
for both your sakes.

311
00:18:53,293 --> 00:18:57,252
If there are rules, you broke them
when you killed Luc.

312
00:18:57,453 --> 00:19:00,445
I'm willing to do the same
to save Jensen.

313
00:19:19,373 --> 00:19:21,204
All right, keep moving.

314
00:19:29,973 --> 00:19:31,884
- Can I help you?
- No, sir.

315
00:19:32,093 --> 00:19:33,685
But I can most certainly help you.

316
00:19:35,013 --> 00:19:38,892
You see, I'm with a law firm.
Davies, O'Donnell and Cross, downtown.

317
00:19:39,093 --> 00:19:40,924
I'm sure you've heard of us.

318
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,483
No? Well, anyhoo, um...

319
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:49,126
Well, one of my less-fortunate clients
is currently serving a 10-year stretch.

320
00:19:49,293 --> 00:19:52,922
Now, he's looking to shave some time
off his sentence by ratting out...

321
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:55,772
...one of your guys who's planning
an escape this very work detail.

322
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:58,322
- Which guy?
- Don't have a name, just a description.

323
00:19:58,533 --> 00:20:02,048
Late 40s, light hair, and he's got
a tattoo on his arm that says "Mandy."

324
00:20:03,053 --> 00:20:05,567
If you don't believe me,
just check the guy for a fork.

325
00:20:05,773 --> 00:20:07,809
He's gonna use it to pop
that little LoJack gizmo...

326
00:20:08,013 --> 00:20:09,924
...they've got on their ankles there.

327
00:20:10,413 --> 00:20:12,290
Wait right here.

329
00:20:26,413 --> 00:20:28,324
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

330
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:30,046
Everything's under control.

331
00:20:30,253 --> 00:20:32,926
- The prisoner's safe?
- <i>They're shaking him down as we speak.</i>

333
00:20:37,253 --> 00:20:41,087
- Thanks, Harry, you're a lifesaver.
- Tell tell me something I don't know.

335
00:20:47,653 --> 00:20:49,530
Drop it. Drop it!

336
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:54,565
Put it on the ground.

337
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:57,522
Now, get your keys out.

338
00:20:57,733 --> 00:20:59,689
Take that thing off of my leg.
Now!

339
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:07,328
- Is that your car?
- Yeah. Actually, it's, uh...

340
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,207
- Come on!
- Aw, hey.

341
00:21:09,413 --> 00:21:11,608
Trust me,
you don't wanna do this, pal, okay?

342
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,326
- Listen...
- Get in the car!

343
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:15,683
- Okay, man. Let's talk about this.
- Now.

344
00:21:15,893 --> 00:21:17,292
Come on, move it.

345
00:21:18,173 --> 00:21:20,004
Let's go!

346
00:21:37,813 --> 00:21:42,728
Nice win, kids. Don't forget,
cram session later, the cadaver lab.

347
00:21:42,933 --> 00:21:45,686
Nobody leaves until we make
the endocrine system our bitch.

348
00:21:46,853 --> 00:21:50,129
Hey, I've got my car today,
so if you need a ride to the clinic...

349
00:21:50,973 --> 00:21:53,248
How'd you know I was volunteering?

350
00:21:54,133 --> 00:21:57,250
Avery mentioned it. She said you
were that much closer to sainthood.

352
00:21:58,893 --> 00:22:02,203
Davis gave me the afternoon off, so
if you think you could use extra hands...

353
00:22:02,413 --> 00:22:04,324
Yeah, always. I just have to warn you...

354
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:07,252
...it's mostly lab work and filing.
It can get pretty boring.

355
00:22:07,853 --> 00:22:10,651
Believe me, I could use
a little more boredom in my life.

356
00:22:10,853 --> 00:22:13,492
- Okay. Yeah.
- Okay.

357
00:22:21,413 --> 00:22:22,687
Whew.

358
00:22:22,853 --> 00:22:25,367
So, um, what are you doing?

359
00:22:25,573 --> 00:22:28,645
The cops are gonna be looking
for this car. I gotta ditch it.

360
00:22:29,293 --> 00:22:33,047
Right. Right, I hear you.
Good idea.

361
00:22:33,253 --> 00:22:36,768
I'm sorry about the gun, by the way.
I hope I didn't scare you too bad.

362
00:22:37,173 --> 00:22:40,449
Aw, I've been there, done that.

363
00:22:40,653 --> 00:22:42,689
Actually, I hate guns.

364
00:22:43,373 --> 00:22:45,807
- Never held one before today.
- Wow.

365
00:22:46,013 --> 00:22:47,605
Could've fooled me.

366
00:22:47,813 --> 00:22:50,088
Thanks for the ride, kid.

367
00:23:01,493 --> 00:23:03,131
This your suit?

368
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:05,688
- Mind if I borrow?
- Just happy to be alive here.

369
00:23:05,893 --> 00:23:07,963
It's all yours.

370
00:23:08,773 --> 00:23:11,685
Okay, okay. Think, Harrison.
Think, think, think.

371
00:23:11,893 --> 00:23:14,202
Okay, what would Tru do?

372
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:19,850
Here's the thing. No one is more
hooked up in this town than I am.

373
00:23:20,413 --> 00:23:23,052
So whatever you need
to get a clean getaway:

374
00:23:23,253 --> 00:23:27,485
- Fake IDs, passports, bus tickets...
- No, thanks. I take care of myself.

375
00:23:27,693 --> 00:23:31,242
Ah, but you might change your mind.
In which case, I should stick around.

376
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:33,171
No. I won't, and you shouldn't.

377
00:23:34,453 --> 00:23:37,092
I hear you. I'm hearing you.
But call me crazy, but l...

378
00:23:37,293 --> 00:23:41,366
You know what I can't figure out?
I let you go, and you're not going.

379
00:23:43,933 --> 00:23:45,685
Look, here's the thing.

380
00:23:45,893 --> 00:23:47,804
Let's just say I'm not a fan
of the cops.

381
00:23:48,013 --> 00:23:49,731
Besides, you seem like a decent guy.

382
00:23:49,933 --> 00:23:53,164
Now, really,
let me do something, please.

383
00:23:58,933 --> 00:24:00,764
Try to keep up.

384
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:03,362
You know,
you are an extremely weird kid.

385
00:24:03,573 --> 00:24:06,406
Yeah, I get that a lot.

386
00:24:07,253 --> 00:24:08,811
<i>This is Harrison. Leave a message.</i>

387
00:24:09,853 --> 00:24:12,048
Hey, Harry, I haven't heard from you
since this morning.

388
00:24:12,213 --> 00:24:14,090
I wanted to make sure you're okay.
Call me.

389
00:24:14,693 --> 00:24:17,366
- How you holding up?
- A couple of paper cuts.

390
00:24:17,533 --> 00:24:19,489
- But otherwise, good.
- Nice.

391
00:24:19,653 --> 00:24:22,565
Jensen, I need you to take
a medical history in Exam Room 1.

392
00:24:22,773 --> 00:24:26,402
- Patient's name is Stan Kirby.
- Stan Kirby. All right, no problem.

393
00:24:32,093 --> 00:24:35,722
All right, Mr. Kirby, let's get started.

394
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:39,603
Well, you're not Mr. Kirby, are you?

395
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:42,122
I somehow seriously doubt
that you're here...

396
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:44,085
...because your sciatica is acting up.

397
00:24:44,293 --> 00:24:46,090
It's good to see you again, Jensen.

398
00:24:46,293 --> 00:24:48,443
Likewise, Jack. You mind telling me
why you're here?

399
00:24:48,853 --> 00:24:52,209
First of all, let me apologize
for sneaking in like this.

400
00:24:52,413 --> 00:24:55,371
I only did it because I didn't
want Tru to know I was here.

401
00:24:55,573 --> 00:24:58,724
- Because...?
- Because I need to talk to you alone...

402
00:24:58,933 --> 00:25:00,810
...about Tru.

403
00:25:01,453 --> 00:25:05,048
She's been keeping something
from you. Something important.

404
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,289
And I think you deserve
to know about it.

405
00:25:07,493 --> 00:25:08,767
Okay.

406
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,646
You see...

407
00:25:11,853 --> 00:25:15,050
...she lost someone close to her
not long ago.

408
00:25:15,453 --> 00:25:20,004
- It was a boyfriend. His name was Luc.
- I didn't know that.

409
00:25:20,213 --> 00:25:22,124
Of course you didn't.
Tru didn't tell you.

410
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:25,086
I can't really say I blame her.
I mean, "My last boyfriend died"...

411
00:25:25,293 --> 00:25:26,726
...isn't exactly a mood setter.

412
00:25:27,053 --> 00:25:29,009
But the thing is...

413
00:25:29,533 --> 00:25:31,649
...Tru never got over Luc.

414
00:25:31,853 --> 00:25:35,607
And since he died, she really hasn't
been able to get close to anyone.

415
00:25:35,973 --> 00:25:38,851
- She keeps sabotaging herself.
- What do you mean?

416
00:25:39,053 --> 00:25:41,123
Haven't you noticed
how secretive she is?

417
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:45,804
How she's always running off but will
never tell you where she's going?

418
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:51,009
Look, I think Tru is a fantastic girl,
and I can tell she's crazy about you...

419
00:25:51,213 --> 00:25:52,612
...and that's why I'm here.

420
00:25:53,453 --> 00:25:55,205
I don't wanna see her screw this up.

421
00:25:55,413 --> 00:25:57,404
I appreciate that, Jack. I do.

422
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:01,052
There's other things you need
to know...

423
00:26:01,253 --> 00:26:03,130
...but I'm late
for another appointment.

424
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:05,972
Why don't you meet me later on,
and I'll tell you everything.

425
00:26:07,813 --> 00:26:09,087
For Tru's sake.

426
00:26:11,053 --> 00:26:12,042
Okay.

427
00:26:12,253 --> 00:26:15,290
Great. I know the perfect place.

428
00:26:15,493 --> 00:26:19,088
I don't believe this. I'm five minutes late,
and you give my appointment away.

429
00:26:19,253 --> 00:26:24,122
- Just spell your name for me, sir?
- Stan Kirby. K-l-R-B-Y.

430
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:27,723
That's odd. I checked a Stan Kirby
into an exam room 10 minutes ago.

431
00:26:27,933 --> 00:26:30,606
Well, I'm Stan Kirby.

432
00:26:30,813 --> 00:26:33,407
So whoever you checked in,
it wasn't me.

433
00:26:40,133 --> 00:26:41,805
And, uh...

434
00:26:43,013 --> 00:26:44,605
This isn't the supply room.

435
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:47,327
Which is why they have a big sign
that says "Exam Room 1."

436
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:49,452
Sorry.

437
00:26:49,613 --> 00:26:53,322
Um, that's all, Mr. Farmer. The doctor's
gonna be with you in a few minutes.

438
00:26:53,933 --> 00:26:55,764
All right.

440
00:26:59,253 --> 00:27:01,892
I thought the nurse asked you
to see a guy named Kirby.

441
00:27:02,093 --> 00:27:04,004
Oh, well they must have given me
the wrong chart.

442
00:27:04,213 --> 00:27:05,692
- It happens all the time here.
- Oh.

443
00:27:05,893 --> 00:27:08,361
Um, listen, I'm gonna get going.
I'm gonna see you later?

444
00:27:08,573 --> 00:27:12,327
I was thinking we could get coffee,
kill some time before you hit the lab.

445
00:27:12,493 --> 00:27:15,451
Uh, I wish I could,
but I gotta go to the library...

446
00:27:15,653 --> 00:27:18,770
...for books for the cram session.
- You should just come to the morgue.

447
00:27:18,973 --> 00:27:23,091
Davis is like the endocrinology king.
He's got tons of books on the subject.

448
00:27:23,773 --> 00:27:26,003
Yeah, I don't wanna put him out,
because he...

449
00:27:26,213 --> 00:27:29,842
Trust me, he'd be happy to help.
Really.

450
00:27:31,973 --> 00:27:33,964
What are we waiting for?
Let's go.

451
00:27:37,853 --> 00:27:41,402
I've gotta tell you, I've seen my share
of fugitive-from-justice flicks...

452
00:27:41,613 --> 00:27:44,366
...and, uh, not one of them had a scene
where a guy on the run...

453
00:27:44,573 --> 00:27:46,928
...would stroll through suburbia
in broad daylight.

454
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:49,010
- Somebody I need to see.
- Oh.

455
00:27:55,813 --> 00:27:57,849
- Hello, Barbara.
- Travis.

456
00:27:58,613 --> 00:28:00,763
I thought you were still...

457
00:28:02,293 --> 00:28:05,251
- What the hell did you do?
- You can read about it in the paper.

458
00:28:05,453 --> 00:28:08,047
Oh, you're unbelievable.

459
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:10,528
- Tell me where the wedding is. I'll go.
- No.

460
00:28:10,693 --> 00:28:12,570
I'm gonna go
to every church in this town.

461
00:28:12,773 --> 00:28:14,729
- You know I will.
- Don't you dare, Travis.

462
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:17,043
Don't you dare ruin this day for her.

463
00:28:17,213 --> 00:28:19,090
Who is he?

464
00:28:20,213 --> 00:28:23,888
- Uh, hostage.
- Yo.

465
00:28:24,053 --> 00:28:26,965
A hostage.
You brought a hostage to my house?

466
00:28:27,613 --> 00:28:30,207
The place looks great, by the way.
David a good provider?

467
00:28:30,413 --> 00:28:31,687
Better than you.

468
00:28:33,613 --> 00:28:35,968
You look great, Barbara.

469
00:28:36,733 --> 00:28:39,008
Touch that car
and I'm calling the cops, Travis.

470
00:28:39,213 --> 00:28:41,169
No, no, no. No cops. Bad idea.

471
00:28:41,373 --> 00:28:42,886
Last chance, Travis.

472
00:28:43,093 --> 00:28:45,323
The cops will hunt Travis down
like an animal.

473
00:28:45,693 --> 00:28:47,968
Now that he's got wheels,
there could be a chase.

474
00:28:48,173 --> 00:28:49,925
Innocent people could get hurt.

475
00:28:50,133 --> 00:28:52,567
Just give me some time to...
Let me talk to him...

476
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:55,003
...try to get him
to turn himself in peaceful.

477
00:28:55,213 --> 00:28:57,522
That car better come back
without a scratch on it.

478
00:28:57,733 --> 00:28:59,371
You have my word.

479
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,847
I'd like to report a stolen vehicle.

481
00:29:18,773 --> 00:29:20,525
Hey. You okay?

482
00:29:20,893 --> 00:29:24,203
Yeah. I'm just, uh, waiting
on a phone call from Tru.

483
00:29:24,933 --> 00:29:26,969
The two of you are thick as thieves.

484
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:29,728
Yeah, we have
a pretty unique relationship.

485
00:29:30,933 --> 00:29:33,652
Oh. As in, you used to go out?

487
00:29:36,453 --> 00:29:40,287
- No. No. God, no. No.
- What is it?

488
00:29:40,453 --> 00:29:41,772
Um...

489
00:29:44,013 --> 00:29:48,564
There's, uh, something about Tru
that you don't know about.

490
00:29:49,253 --> 00:29:52,404
No one knows it except me.

491
00:29:55,613 --> 00:29:58,446
- It's okay.
- She's not properly insured...

492
00:29:58,653 --> 00:30:01,292
...to drive the morgue van.
It's my fault, really.

493
00:30:01,493 --> 00:30:03,563
I didn't do the paperwork.

495
00:30:06,493 --> 00:30:08,051
Hi. Hope we're not interrupting.

496
00:30:08,253 --> 00:30:10,289
No. No, no, no. Uh, have you...?

497
00:30:10,493 --> 00:30:12,643
Have you...? Uh, Jensen, this is Carrie.

498
00:30:13,413 --> 00:30:15,290
- Hey. Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

499
00:30:16,093 --> 00:30:18,402
We were hoping maybe
we could borrow some books.

500
00:30:18,613 --> 00:30:22,526
Yeah. Any particular subject in mind?

502
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:30,929
- Got something for me?
- <i>You should know...</i>

503
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:33,169
...that the boyfriend's here
at the morgue.

504
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,364
He's supposed to meet me.
He may need prodding.

505
00:30:35,573 --> 00:30:37,450
If you see an opportunity
to seal the deal...

506
00:30:37,693 --> 00:30:40,287
- I will take it.
- Good girl.

507
00:30:40,493 --> 00:30:42,449
So I take it
that was your ex back there?

508
00:30:42,653 --> 00:30:44,086
Yep.

509
00:30:44,573 --> 00:30:46,928
That whole wedding you mentioned...?

510
00:30:47,133 --> 00:30:49,647
My daughter's. Mandy.

511
00:30:49,853 --> 00:30:52,765
So that's why you busted loose today
so you can go.

512
00:30:53,733 --> 00:30:57,487
So, what the hell are you gonna say
to her when you see her?

513
00:30:57,653 --> 00:30:58,972
Nothing.

514
00:30:59,173 --> 00:31:01,892
Mandy doesn't know I'm her father.

515
00:31:02,453 --> 00:31:07,049
Her mom married David shortly after
I started my sentence.

516
00:31:07,253 --> 00:31:09,687
Mandy was a little baby.
They never told her about me.

517
00:31:09,893 --> 00:31:13,681
- That's pretty cold, don't you think?
- David gave her a good life...

518
00:31:13,893 --> 00:31:16,726
...with all the things that I couldn't.
I'm grateful for that.

519
00:31:16,933 --> 00:31:20,403
That's why all I want is a glimpse
of my baby on her big day.

520
00:31:20,613 --> 00:31:23,685
After that, I'm gonna turn myself in.

521
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:26,083
- What's that?
- It's receipt from a florist.

522
00:31:26,293 --> 00:31:28,966
I found it under the seat.
It's a big order.

523
00:31:29,253 --> 00:31:31,289
It's going to St. Augustine's today.

524
00:31:31,493 --> 00:31:34,053
Guess we know
where that wedding is, huh?

525
00:31:34,413 --> 00:31:35,846
So, uh...

526
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:41,051
...if you don't mind me asking, uh,
what did they lock you up for?

527
00:31:41,253 --> 00:31:43,528
I was a getaway driver.
Bank heists, mostly.

528
00:31:43,733 --> 00:31:45,610
I started when I was about your age.

529
00:31:46,853 --> 00:31:49,651
So before you got busted,
you ever think of going straight?

530
00:31:50,013 --> 00:31:53,085
You kidding me? All the time, kid.

531
00:31:53,733 --> 00:31:57,328
I learned pretty quick, though,
a man can't change what he is.

532
00:31:57,533 --> 00:32:00,923
Oh, of course he can.
I know it's hard to believe...

533
00:32:01,133 --> 00:32:04,125
...but, uh, I was kind of a...

534
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:06,403
A small-time scammer.

535
00:32:06,613 --> 00:32:08,569
- Really?
- Oh, yeah. I'm serious.

536
00:32:08,773 --> 00:32:11,367
And now I got a 9-to-5, and, uh...

537
00:32:12,173 --> 00:32:14,607
Well, I'm kicking much ass,
I might add.

538
00:32:14,813 --> 00:32:16,883
You'll slip up.
Guys like us always do.

540
00:32:18,973 --> 00:32:21,567
Damn it. Hold on.

541
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:31,564
And last but not least,
<i>Ampoule's Modern Physiology</i>.

542
00:32:31,733 --> 00:32:36,568
Oh, thanks. They're, uh, heavy. Good.

543
00:32:36,773 --> 00:32:38,491
Can I have a word with you, please?

544
00:32:40,173 --> 00:32:43,085
I'll just read these...

545
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:44,925
...books.

547
00:32:50,293 --> 00:32:51,806
- Is something wrong?
- You tell me.

548
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:54,652
- You didn't check in with me.
- I didn't know I needed to.

549
00:32:54,853 --> 00:32:56,923
I left you three messages.
You didn't call me back.

550
00:32:57,573 --> 00:33:00,804
- Because I had everything under control.
- Two people asked for help last night.

551
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:02,969
That is a lot to handle, even for you.

552
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:05,203
If you're trying
to keep something from me...

553
00:33:05,413 --> 00:33:07,688
...whatever it is, I can handle it.
I just wanna help.

554
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:11,643
Two people didn't ask for help
last night, Davis, only one did.

555
00:33:12,493 --> 00:33:15,724
- And it wasn't Jensen.
- I don't understand. Jensen didn't die?

556
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:18,407
I'm saying he didn't ask for help.

557
00:33:18,573 --> 00:33:20,211
Look, I'm sorry I lied.

558
00:33:20,413 --> 00:33:22,973
I didn't think that you'd help me
if you knew the truth.

559
00:33:23,173 --> 00:33:26,643
Tru, look, at the end of the day,
you're the one saving lives. I get that.

560
00:33:26,813 --> 00:33:29,805
And if you ever needed me,
I'll always be here for you.

561
00:33:30,013 --> 00:33:31,571
Especially today, Tru.

562
00:33:32,253 --> 00:33:34,289
- Hey.
- Hey.

563
00:33:34,493 --> 00:33:37,849
- Oh, is Davis...?
- Outside talking to Tru.

564
00:33:38,053 --> 00:33:41,284
Oh, great. I'm telling you,
once those two get started...

565
00:33:41,493 --> 00:33:43,723
...it takes forever for them to stop.

566
00:33:44,453 --> 00:33:45,727
Really?

567
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:48,163
You look like there's someplace
you need to be.

568
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:52,167
Yeah, I'm supposed to meet somebody,
but I don't wanna interrupt, you know?

569
00:33:52,373 --> 00:33:55,251
Oh, don't worry about it.
I'll just tell them you had to run.

570
00:33:55,413 --> 00:33:58,007
I think there's another reason
you're keeping the truth from me.

571
00:33:58,173 --> 00:34:01,290
I think, on some level, you think
there's something wrong with this.

572
00:34:01,493 --> 00:34:03,961
That there's a reason
that Jensen didn't ask for help.

573
00:34:04,173 --> 00:34:06,243
You think fate wanted him
to stay dead?

574
00:34:06,453 --> 00:34:09,684
- Well, don't you?
- I don't give a damn what fate wants...

575
00:34:09,853 --> 00:34:12,686
...because fate obviously
doesn't give a damn about me.

576
00:34:12,893 --> 00:34:15,088
How can you say that,
you, of all people?

577
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:17,444
Look at my life, Davis.

578
00:34:17,653 --> 00:34:20,372
Look at everything I've sacrificed
to do this job...

579
00:34:20,573 --> 00:34:22,609
...to answer this calling.

580
00:34:22,813 --> 00:34:26,567
I've lost friends, family, sleep, sanity,
you name it...

581
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,809
...all in the name of fate.

582
00:34:29,013 --> 00:34:31,447
And how does fate repay me?

583
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:34,486
It takes the people I'm closest to.
First my mother...

584
00:34:34,693 --> 00:34:37,002
...then Luc, and now Jensen.

585
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:40,449
I'm sorry, but enough is enough.

586
00:34:40,653 --> 00:34:43,406
I'm not giving up Jensen
without a fight.

587
00:34:49,133 --> 00:34:50,964
- Where's Jensen?
- Oh, he left.

588
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:52,652
He said he had to meet a friend.

589
00:34:56,653 --> 00:34:58,928
Jack. It's gotta be.

590
00:34:59,133 --> 00:35:01,567
The consignment store.
Jack must have sent him back.

591
00:35:01,773 --> 00:35:04,606
But I talked the owner into closing it.
I even watched him lock up.

592
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:07,373
Well, knowing Jack,
he found a way to reopen it.

593
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:10,207
He was shot once in the chest
at approximately 5:30...

594
00:35:10,373 --> 00:35:12,284
...and he died en route to the hospital.

595
00:35:13,853 --> 00:35:16,731
All right, I'll try and cut him off.
In the meantime, keep dialing.

596
00:35:16,933 --> 00:35:18,969
See if anyone's at the store.

597
00:35:27,613 --> 00:35:29,524
- <i>City Morgue.</i>
- He's not here, Davis.

598
00:35:29,733 --> 00:35:31,530
- The store's still closed.
- I figured as much.

599
00:35:31,733 --> 00:35:34,725
- No one answered when I called.
- Jack's got him, I know it.

600
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:36,412
<i>Yeah, but the question is where.</i>

601
00:35:39,493 --> 00:35:42,087
I know where Jack took him,
to the crash site.

602
00:35:44,733 --> 00:35:46,724
Glad you could make it, buddy.

603
00:35:46,933 --> 00:35:49,401
I saved you the best seat
in the house.

605
00:36:06,733 --> 00:36:09,805
Well, might as well. Do you mind?

606
00:36:10,773 --> 00:36:13,651
- I had a feeling it was you.
- Whatever you did, it didn't work.

607
00:36:13,853 --> 00:36:16,606
That prisoner still escaped.
Now the police are after him.

608
00:36:16,813 --> 00:36:21,443
Oh, yeah, well, I kind of got a front-row
seat, if you know what I mean.

609
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:24,571
- You're what?
- I'm in the car with the guy.

610
00:36:24,773 --> 00:36:28,083
- How?
- I'd love to tell you the whole story...

611
00:36:28,293 --> 00:36:31,524
...but I'm a little busy right now.
- <i>I'm five minutes away.</i>

612
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:33,564
Keep him away
from the Third Street Café.

613
00:36:33,773 --> 00:36:35,684
That's where he lost control
of the car.

614
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:38,726
Oh, good news.
We're nowhere near Third Street.

615
00:36:48,653 --> 00:36:52,532
Uh, you know that whole thing
about being nowhere near Third?

616
00:36:52,733 --> 00:36:54,166
Scratch that.

617
00:36:54,373 --> 00:36:56,807
Hey, before we get started,
would you like a beer?

618
00:36:57,013 --> 00:37:00,289
- Yeah, actually, that sounds great.
- I'll take care of it. I know the bartender.

619
00:37:00,493 --> 00:37:03,929
She always gives me free drinks.
You stay right there.

620
00:37:05,253 --> 00:37:06,845
I can't seem to shake these guys.

621
00:37:07,533 --> 00:37:10,252
Okay, how about we call it a day...

622
00:37:10,453 --> 00:37:12,842
...and pull over for the nice policeman.
What do you say?

623
00:37:13,093 --> 00:37:16,051
- My daughter's wedding. Not a chance.
- Okay.

625
00:37:20,413 --> 00:37:22,051
Harry?

626
00:37:22,613 --> 00:37:23,602
Harry, are you there?

627
00:37:24,933 --> 00:37:27,128
Oh, God, watch out!
Oh, God! God!

628
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:29,051
Oh.

629
00:37:29,253 --> 00:37:30,288
Harry!

630
00:37:33,653 --> 00:37:35,291
Get out!

631
00:37:37,413 --> 00:37:39,290
Jensen!

633
00:37:43,613 --> 00:37:45,843
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.

634
00:37:48,853 --> 00:37:50,650
What the hell are you doing here?

635
00:37:50,853 --> 00:37:54,892
Call it fate. Just wait here.
I'm gonna go check on the driver.

637
00:38:00,533 --> 00:38:02,046
Are you all right?

638
00:38:02,453 --> 00:38:06,651
Yeah, just a couple bumps and bruises.
Nothing to write home about.

639
00:38:06,813 --> 00:38:09,486
We should get you to the hospital,
get you checked out.

640
00:38:09,693 --> 00:38:14,084
No, no, no. Maybe later.
Something me and Travis gotta do.

641
00:38:26,133 --> 00:38:28,522
She is something, isn't she?

642
00:38:28,733 --> 00:38:32,089
Yeah, she's a stunner.
No doubt about it.

643
00:38:33,053 --> 00:38:34,645
The question is...

644
00:38:35,493 --> 00:38:37,882
...is she worth it?
- What do you think?

646
00:38:55,293 --> 00:38:58,683
Uh, time for me to go, kid.

647
00:38:59,693 --> 00:39:02,924
Here's hoping I never see you
around the yard.

648
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:07,289
Like I told you...

649
00:39:08,133 --> 00:39:09,566
...I'm not that guy anymore.

650
00:39:09,773 --> 00:39:12,333
You know, I think you're right.

651
00:39:26,973 --> 00:39:30,807
I thought you might wanna know
we're two for two today.

652
00:39:33,493 --> 00:39:35,245
Come on, Davis, you gotta admit...

653
00:39:35,453 --> 00:39:37,842
...I saved Jensen,
and the world didn't end.

654
00:39:38,053 --> 00:39:40,487
So it's okay to admit
that you were wrong.

655
00:39:40,693 --> 00:39:43,605
I still think my concerns were valid.

656
00:39:44,933 --> 00:39:49,404
But, having said that,
if I were the one reliving days...

657
00:39:49,613 --> 00:39:53,208
...and Carrie had died on day one,
I probably would've done the same thing.

658
00:39:53,573 --> 00:39:54,892
Hmm.

659
00:39:55,053 --> 00:39:57,647
Oh, and speaking of Carrie, um...

660
00:39:58,893 --> 00:40:00,804
...I think it's time
we tell her the truth.

661
00:40:01,573 --> 00:40:04,292
- About?
- About what we do here.

662
00:40:04,493 --> 00:40:07,769
- We don't even know her.
- She... You know, I care about her.

663
00:40:07,973 --> 00:40:10,123
And I think she would be
an important asset.

664
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:11,971
You know,
if she had known about Jensen...

665
00:40:12,173 --> 00:40:14,004
...she wouldn't have let him
leave today.

666
00:40:14,213 --> 00:40:15,771
Davis...

667
00:40:16,813 --> 00:40:20,362
Okay. All right. I don't...
I didn't think you'd go for it.

668
00:40:20,573 --> 00:40:22,131
I just had to ask.

669
00:40:22,613 --> 00:40:25,332
Well, I gotta go. I'm gonna be late
for my study session.

670
00:40:25,973 --> 00:40:27,247
See you tomorrow.

671
00:40:41,173 --> 00:40:42,526
Hey, there she is.

672
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:44,086
Nice job.

673
00:40:45,933 --> 00:40:49,164
- Nice to see you, too, Av.
- Thank you, Tru. Seriously, thank you.

674
00:40:49,373 --> 00:40:50,647
Thank you, thank you.

675
00:40:50,853 --> 00:40:53,765
I sort of let it slip
that you saved my life today, so...

676
00:40:53,973 --> 00:40:56,612
If he had died...
I checked school policy...

677
00:40:56,773 --> 00:41:00,732
...we all would've gotten A's for this
semester, which would've been nice too.

678
00:41:01,053 --> 00:41:03,248
- Yeah.
- I'm just saying...

680
00:41:06,293 --> 00:41:08,682
- Hey, you okay?
- Oh, yeah.

681
00:41:08,893 --> 00:41:11,168
I think I sprained something
when you tackled me.

682
00:41:11,373 --> 00:41:13,682
- Oh, God, I'm sorry about that.
- It's okay. Believe me...

683
00:41:13,893 --> 00:41:15,724
...I prefer it to the alternative.

684
00:41:15,933 --> 00:41:18,686
- Can I take a look?
- Yeah, go ahead, please.

685
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:21,732
- Ooh.
- What?

686
00:41:21,893 --> 00:41:23,565
That's weird.

687
00:41:25,453 --> 00:41:28,650
I'm getting this serious case
of déjà vu right now.
