00:00:00,035 --> 00:00:01,040
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:02,132 --> 00:00:03,414
<i>on My Name Is Earl...</i>

3
00:00:04,301 --> 00:00:05,318
<i>In a world...</i>

4
00:00:06,053 --> 00:00:07,543
<i>where friends are hard to find,</i>

5
00:00:07,805 --> 00:00:09,253
<i>and even harder to keep,</i>

6
00:00:09,515 --> 00:00:12,154
<i>and even harder than that,
if you can find them,</i>

7
00:00:13,102 --> 00:00:14,967
<i>there was an innocent
mustached prisoner.</i>

8
00:00:15,942 --> 00:00:17,433
<i>His un-mustached guard brother,</i>

9
00:00:18,566 --> 00:00:20,431
<i>locked in a no-holds-barred battle</i>

10
00:00:20,738 --> 00:00:22,516
<i>to decide who's in charge.</i>

11
00:00:22,778 --> 00:00:26,353
Face it, you only took this job cause
you couldn't exist out there without me.

12
00:00:26,615 --> 00:00:28,939
Or maybe I knew
you couldn't exist in here without me.

13
00:00:29,201 --> 00:00:32,098
Or maybe you're getting defensive
and saying everything I say back at me.

14
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:34,809
Or maybe you're just saying
what I'm gonna say before I say it!

15
00:00:35,082 --> 00:00:37,156
- What?
- I don't know! Why don't you tell me!

16
00:00:38,377 --> 00:00:41,160
<i>And a pregnant ex-wife
who will stop at nothing</i>

17
00:00:41,422 --> 00:00:45,247
<i>to get her sister's surrogated,
bi-racial baby out of her womb.</i>

18
00:00:48,012 --> 00:00:50,961
<i>Now, a renegade criminal
is on the loose, with nothing to lose.</i>

19
00:00:52,607 --> 00:00:57,134
<i>And an angry warden must answer
to himself and his governor wife.</i>

20
00:00:57,396 --> 00:00:59,623
I know what I'm doing!
I'm a grown man!

21
00:01:01,215 --> 00:01:03,846
<i>Now, in order to protect his job,</i>

22
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:07,853
<i>the warden must find someone just
crazy enough to attempt the impossible.</i>

23
00:01:08,115 --> 00:01:09,933
Because you're both going
to go out there,

24
00:01:10,018 --> 00:01:12,733
you're going to get Frank
and you're going to bring him back here!

25
00:01:13,037 --> 00:01:15,885
<i>A secret mission
that no one can find out about.</i>

26
00:01:15,977 --> 00:01:17,237
No troopers, no press.

27
00:01:17,499 --> 00:01:20,575
And the governor
can never hear about this.

28
00:01:20,961 --> 00:01:22,159
<i>A difficult mission...</i>

29
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:23,744
<i>made mission impossible.</i>

30
00:01:24,048 --> 00:01:25,829
Before we go,
which one of us is in charge?

31
00:01:26,091 --> 00:01:27,367
You two figure it out.

32
00:01:28,177 --> 00:01:30,125
<i>Two feuding brothers.</i>

33
00:01:30,512 --> 00:01:31,627
<i>One escaped convict.</i>

34
00:01:32,014 --> 00:01:33,671
<i>Zero chances to fail.</i>

Season 3 - Episode 10
<i>Midnight Bun</i>

36
00:01:37,854 --> 00:01:38,911
Damn it, Randy,

37
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:41,387
the warden's my best chance
of getting out of here early.

38
00:01:41,483 --> 00:01:43,389
Why would you take
convicts for ice cream?

39
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:45,683
They get ice cream
in the prison cafeteria.

40
00:01:45,945 --> 00:01:48,440
I didn't want them
to taste the ice cream, Earl.

41
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:50,229
I wanted them to taste the freedom.

42
00:01:50,822 --> 00:01:54,553
Okay, look, we have 46 hours.
Frank couldn't have gotten that far.

43
00:01:54,676 --> 00:01:56,068
Where is the ice cream store?

44
00:01:56,337 --> 00:01:59,827
It's the one next to the train station
and that costume store,

45
00:01:59,936 --> 00:02:01,907
near the bong shop
where they make the fake ids.

46
00:02:02,492 --> 00:02:04,127
We just have to look for a guy

47
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:07,830
who could be dressed as anything
and who's anywhere a train might go.

49
00:02:12,491 --> 00:02:16,171
Last tuesday, a bunch of prisoners put
a tiny bird in your food and you ate it.

50
00:02:16,433 --> 00:02:19,049
I wasn't going to say anything,
but now I want you to suffer.

51
00:02:19,311 --> 00:02:21,510
<i>Me and Randy were just
beginning our journey,</i>

52
00:02:21,772 --> 00:02:23,108
<i>and Joy was trying to end hers,</i>

53
00:02:23,217 --> 00:02:25,422
<i>by giving birth to her
half-sister's overdue baby.</i>

54
00:02:25,515 --> 00:02:28,684
Whichever one of you pregnant bitches
thinks you're going next, you are wrong.

55
00:02:28,946 --> 00:02:31,228
I need to get some drugs
to kick start this delivery!

56
00:02:31,588 --> 00:02:33,981
You promised your sister
you'd deliver naturally.

57
00:02:34,243 --> 00:02:36,551
You want their little one coming in
dripping with lies?

58
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,337
You know my word doesn't mean anything.

59
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:41,532
If it did, we wouldn't have been humping
when I was still married to Earl.

60
00:02:41,655 --> 00:02:43,624
In that case,
the shame was part of the rush.

61
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:46,577
But without illicit sex,
shame is just shame.

62
00:02:47,303 --> 00:02:49,413
Whatever. Excuse me!

63
00:02:50,217 --> 00:02:52,833
Hey, last name's Turner.
I need to see a doctor, <i>pronto</i>.

64
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:55,919
Dr. Pronto to reception please.

65
00:02:56,181 --> 00:02:57,379
Dr. Pronto.

66
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:01,967
You got to be kidding me?

67
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,053
You know what?

68
00:03:04,179 --> 00:03:06,201
If somebody shows up, I'll take him.

69
00:03:08,615 --> 00:03:10,911
<i>While Joy was trying
to push out one child,</i>

70
00:03:11,048 --> 00:03:13,405
<i>Darnell had asked Catalina
to watch their other two.</i>

71
00:03:13,515 --> 00:03:14,864
You can hang out in here.

72
00:03:14,977 --> 00:03:16,767
Don't be scared,
no one died in this room.

73
00:03:16,873 --> 00:03:18,408
They made it to the stairway.

74
00:03:18,527 --> 00:03:19,568
It smells.

75
00:03:20,473 --> 00:03:22,237
What are we gonna do in here?

76
00:03:22,499 --> 00:03:24,448
I don't know,
I'm not very good with kids.

77
00:03:24,757 --> 00:03:27,238
No offense, but you guys
freak me out with your tiny hands

78
00:03:27,342 --> 00:03:28,952
and your teeth falling out all the time.

79
00:03:30,841 --> 00:03:32,039
Do you know any games?

80
00:03:33,662 --> 00:03:37,169
When I was a little girl, we used to
play a game called <i>Hide and Don't Peek</i>.

81
00:03:38,227 --> 00:03:39,463
How do you play?

82
00:03:40,047 --> 00:03:43,091
An gunman takes your family hostage,
while you run and hide,

83
00:03:43,353 --> 00:03:46,094
and then you pray the guerillas
leave before they find you.

84
00:03:46,356 --> 00:03:47,221
And how do you win?

85
00:03:47,932 --> 00:03:51,058
By pulling the bodies on top of you
and laying very, very still.

86
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,666
<i>It felt good to be
outside the prison walls,</i>

87
00:03:57,803 --> 00:03:58,978
<i>but not too good.</i>

88
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:00,659
Really? Are these necessary?

89
00:04:00,768 --> 00:04:02,039
It's prison policy.

90
00:04:02,146 --> 00:04:05,507
- Like taking convicts for ice cream.
- No, that's not prison policy.

91
00:04:05,603 --> 00:04:07,786
Haven't you learned
anything from what I did?

92
00:04:08,475 --> 00:04:09,538
What's this?

93
00:04:09,691 --> 00:04:11,372
It's a search dog.

94
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:12,996
I had him sniff Frank's bed.

95
00:04:13,258 --> 00:04:16,792
The warden doesn't want word to get out
that we're chasing an escaped convict.

96
00:04:17,054 --> 00:04:20,576
Don't you think a guy in a guard uniform
with a search dog is kind of obvious?

97
00:04:20,686 --> 00:04:22,573
Don't you think a guy
in a prisoner uniform

98
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:24,564
with handcuffs is kind of obvious?

99
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,241
Glass houses, Earl.
Glass houses.

100
00:04:27,364 --> 00:04:28,762
We're not taking the stupid dog.

101
00:04:29,024 --> 00:04:30,882
I already found out
where Frank's headed.

102
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,221
<i>After I left the warden's,</i>

103
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,654
<i>I went to find
Frank's old stealing buddy.</i>

104
00:04:35,783 --> 00:04:38,011
Paco, I didn't know
you knew how to write music.

105
00:04:38,202 --> 00:04:40,088
Turns out it's easy.

106
00:04:40,393 --> 00:04:42,320
It's just dots and lines.

107
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,362
When I get out of here, I'm gonna find
someone to play it for me.

108
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,115
I can't wait to hear
what it sounds like.

109
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:52,617
Maybe you haven't heard, but...

110
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:53,954
Frank escaped.

111
00:04:54,284 --> 00:04:56,039
Damn it!
Frank escaped?

112
00:04:56,148 --> 00:04:58,496
He's gonna get all the money
that we hid in the trailer.

113
00:04:59,096 --> 00:05:00,335
You hid money in our trailer?

114
00:05:03,842 --> 00:05:05,209
Thanks, Paco.

115
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:06,617
Damn.

116
00:05:07,146 --> 00:05:09,644
I hope this song is a sad song.

117
00:05:10,902 --> 00:05:13,408
Give me the keys
and uncuff me so I can drive.

118
00:05:13,531 --> 00:05:14,995
I'm driving, I'm in charge.

119
00:05:15,075 --> 00:05:16,511
Randy, you're not in charge.

120
00:05:16,618 --> 00:05:17,895
Plus, your foot's too big.

121
00:05:18,005 --> 00:05:20,861
When you drive, your shoe hits the gas
and the break at the same time.

122
00:05:20,947 --> 00:05:23,191
- It's terrifying.
- I'm driving, I'm the cop.

123
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:25,424
- You're not a cop.
- Oh yeah, if I'm not a cop,

124
00:05:25,517 --> 00:05:28,447
then how come when I pull up at
the home depot, all those guys run away?

125
00:05:28,776 --> 00:05:30,758
You mean like your dog just did?

126
00:05:33,547 --> 00:05:34,559
Damn it.

127
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,998
All right then, I'll just have
to pick up the scent on my own.

128
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,707
Frank stinks.

129
00:05:41,816 --> 00:05:43,607
How do dogs do this?

130
00:05:52,107 --> 00:05:53,428
This is kind of small.

131
00:05:54,023 --> 00:05:57,290
Oh, whatever. All I need is
gravity, a bucket and a wet nap.

132
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,769
Let's do this thing.

133
00:06:04,562 --> 00:06:07,021
Oh... my... God.

134
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,808
Look at this place.

135
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:11,531
This must where pregnant brides
come on their honeymoon.

136
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,947
And here's some extra services
available for a nominal fee.

137
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:19,266
Volcanic mud mask,
aroma therapy, eucalyptus wrap.

138
00:06:19,893 --> 00:06:22,216
That sounds delicious.

139
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:25,506
Is the feminine face peel
just for the ladies?

140
00:06:25,616 --> 00:06:27,611
Or can the gentleman
purchase that as well?

141
00:06:27,734 --> 00:06:30,604
- Who pays for all these nominals?
- Since you're just a surrogate,

142
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:34,299
it would be Mr. and Mrs. Ray-Ray
and Liberty Washington.

143
00:06:34,425 --> 00:06:36,974
Good. Then bring us
some of those eucalyptus things,

144
00:06:37,236 --> 00:06:39,011
extra mayo,
miracle whip if you got it,

145
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,604
and hurry up cause I want to eat before
the nurse gets here with that shot.

146
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,883
Can you believe this fancy menu?

147
00:06:48,025 --> 00:06:50,362
I swear it's like
I've died and gone to Chili's.

148
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,125
<i>Me and Randy
were staking out Joy's trailer,</i>

149
00:06:53,223 --> 00:06:55,271
<i>waiting for Frank to show up
and get his money.</i>

150
00:06:55,383 --> 00:06:56,599
<i>As luck would have it,</i>

151
00:06:56,709 --> 00:07:00,713
<i>I was spending my one day out of prison
locked up in a small space with a man.</i>

152
00:07:00,845 --> 00:07:02,089
Well, where are you?

153
00:07:02,581 --> 00:07:05,260
I'm at the american terminal
and I don't see you.

154
00:07:05,697 --> 00:07:07,173
Nah, I haven't had dinner yet.

155
00:07:07,282 --> 00:07:09,250
I thought we'd pick
something up on our way.

156
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:10,644
Randy, what are you doing?

157
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,552
Hang on, I've got
someone talking to me.

158
00:07:14,136 --> 00:07:17,264
I just wanted to see
what it'd be like to have a cell phone.

159
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,068
Sorry, that was my brother.

160
00:07:20,205 --> 00:07:21,763
Yeah, he really is.

161
00:07:23,156 --> 00:07:25,460
You're gonna have to find
your own way home,

162
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:28,950
cause my brother took prisoners
for ice cream, and then he lost one.

163
00:07:29,063 --> 00:07:31,903
So we can't go anywhere
'cause he's a sucky guard.

164
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:34,239
You look so stupid right now.

165
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:40,036
<i>I was trying to get Randy
to stop acting like a kid</i>

166
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:43,520
<i>and Dodge and Earl Jr were trying to get
Catalina to start acting like one.</i>

167
00:07:43,645 --> 00:07:46,126
So you never played <i>Simon says</i>?

168
00:07:47,347 --> 00:07:48,336
<i>Freeze tag</i>?

169
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:50,589
<i>Hot potato</i>?

170
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,051
Hot potatoes were rare,
and reserved for birthdays only.

171
00:07:56,015 --> 00:07:57,429
How about <i>Patty cake</i>?

172
00:07:58,235 --> 00:07:59,639
Is that where you go like this?

173
00:08:00,986 --> 00:08:02,426
And then get hit in the face

174
00:08:02,738 --> 00:08:04,686
for playing games
instead of working the cocoa fields?

175
00:08:04,948 --> 00:08:08,565
Just clap hands with me.
Nothing bad is going to happen.

176
00:08:17,242 --> 00:08:20,006
Randy, just give me the keys
so I can uncuff myself.

177
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:23,778
I'm not supposed to uncuff
a prisoner just because he asks.

178
00:08:24,123 --> 00:08:25,842
It says so in the manual.

179
00:08:26,345 --> 00:08:29,288
Really? What does it say to do
if a prisoner does this?

180
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:33,799
I don't know, I haven't read
the whole thing yet. Stop it, Earl!

181
00:08:34,061 --> 00:08:35,389
Uncuff me and I will!

182
00:08:35,492 --> 00:08:37,433
You know I can't stand
the sound of honking

183
00:08:37,513 --> 00:08:39,054
since I got attacked by those gooses!

184
00:08:39,316 --> 00:08:41,062
They're probably on their way here!

185
00:08:41,185 --> 00:08:43,100
Okay, I'll give you the key!
Call 'em off!

186
00:08:50,893 --> 00:08:53,093
I think they messed up
on our crudités tray.

187
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,556
It's just vegetables.

188
00:08:54,695 --> 00:08:56,184
That's what it's supposed to be.

189
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,801
Then they nailed it.
This place is great.

190
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:00,830
If the pro-lifers knew
what they were doing,

191
00:09:00,939 --> 00:09:02,880
they would just get
everybody great insurance.

192
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:05,705
Oh, good!
We didn't miss it!

193
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:07,347
How'd you know we were here?

194
00:09:07,437 --> 00:09:10,471
A volunteer from the hospital called
to say our surrogate was admitted.

195
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,963
And they offered me a discount
on a newborn photo shoot.

196
00:09:13,315 --> 00:09:14,942
They can put in a backdrop later

197
00:09:15,051 --> 00:09:17,402
that makes the baby look like
he's on the space shuttle.

198
00:09:18,064 --> 00:09:19,094
Space baby...

199
00:09:19,356 --> 00:09:20,438
that's tight.

200
00:09:20,774 --> 00:09:21,847
Let's not dilly dally.

201
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,057
We've got to get you down
to the water birthing tub.

202
00:09:25,176 --> 00:09:26,501
Water what?

203
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:29,855
Why do you want me
to give birth underwater?

204
00:09:30,117 --> 00:09:32,774
You didn't secretly impregnate me
with some kind of fish baby?

205
00:09:33,036 --> 00:09:34,724
Oh, Joy, you're gonna love this.

206
00:09:34,838 --> 00:09:36,903
It's based on ancient wisdom
and tradition.

207
00:09:37,165 --> 00:09:39,578
It goes all the way back to the '70s.

208
00:09:39,918 --> 00:09:41,437
Where's the mama in a hurry?

209
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:43,242
What the hell is that?

210
00:09:43,368 --> 00:09:44,786
It's just my insulin.

211
00:09:45,048 --> 00:09:46,660
You know I'm epileptic.

212
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,892
You're inducing.

213
00:09:49,015 --> 00:09:51,251
Are you kidding me?
You're not in labor!

214
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:54,713
I'm going to get inside your hippie tub,
and against everything I believe in,

215
00:09:54,975 --> 00:09:56,322
let this baby swim out of me,

216
00:09:56,421 --> 00:09:58,372
and hopefully it pops
and surfaces like a cork.

217
00:09:58,467 --> 00:09:59,467
Or a witch baby.

218
00:09:59,795 --> 00:10:00,803
And in return,

219
00:10:01,344 --> 00:10:03,237
you're gonna let this man nurse
give me a shot

220
00:10:03,317 --> 00:10:04,682
so we can get this over with.

221
00:10:04,943 --> 00:10:06,057
Don't give her the shot.

222
00:10:06,381 --> 00:10:08,284
My body, my choice!

223
00:10:08,732 --> 00:10:10,704
I'm getting this thing out of me.

224
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:15,777
Now give me that shot,

225
00:10:15,942 --> 00:10:18,675
or get me a fishing pole with a jar
of baby food on the end of it.

226
00:10:19,572 --> 00:10:22,442
<i>There was something
that wannabe doctor was not aware of.</i>

227
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:25,175
<i>Liberty was better known
as "Lady Liberty of Blow"...</i>

228
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,279
<i>the black ladies of wrestling.</i>

229
00:10:39,255 --> 00:10:40,635
I think you dropped something.

230
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,840
Damn it, you bogarted
my inducing drugs.

231
00:10:43,105 --> 00:10:44,841
You're not taking any drugs!

232
00:10:45,122 --> 00:10:46,661
Fine. Darnell.

233
00:10:46,741 --> 00:10:49,115
Grab all the shampoos
and shower caps out of the bathroom.

234
00:10:49,285 --> 00:10:50,973
We're getting out of here.

235
00:10:56,828 --> 00:10:59,903
Do you have any literature on the affect
of oxytocin on the male gender?

236
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,141
But if you survive and
want to write something up,

237
00:11:03,248 --> 00:11:04,574
I bet you could get it published.

238
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:10,130
<i>Joy was having trouble
being a surrogate parent,</i>

239
00:11:10,338 --> 00:11:12,420
<i>but Catalina was finding it
quite enjoyable.</i>

240
00:11:12,622 --> 00:11:15,458
<i>In fact, the kids've finally taught her
how to be a kid herself.</i>

241
00:11:16,849 --> 00:11:18,429
I did it!
I won again!

242
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:21,445
<i>Somebody else will have to teach her
how to be a good sport,</i>

243
00:11:21,525 --> 00:11:22,907
Suck on that, white one!

244
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:24,778
<i>and the kids names.</i>

245
00:11:33,821 --> 00:11:35,202
I'm going to get ice cream.

246
00:11:35,492 --> 00:11:37,167
- No, you're not.
- Yeah, I am.

247
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,698
- Stop or I shoot.
- What you're gonna do?

248
00:11:44,973 --> 00:11:47,128
Shoot me with that
stupid bean bag gun?

249
00:11:47,587 --> 00:11:48,853
I'm really sca...

250
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,065
I got the bean bag!
What are you going to do now, genius?

251
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:20,211
<i>I don't know why the ice cream guy
has all those pictures up.</i>

252
00:12:20,716 --> 00:12:23,048
<i>All he's got are creamsicles and pot.</i>

253
00:12:29,303 --> 00:12:30,518
Oh, God.

254
00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:32,222
What is it now?

255
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:34,984
Randy, I can't keep up
with your emotions.

256
00:12:35,983 --> 00:12:37,276
You were right all along.

257
00:12:38,814 --> 00:12:40,411
I'm not a good prison guard.

258
00:12:40,617 --> 00:12:42,194
I'm not good at so many things.

259
00:12:42,478 --> 00:12:45,260
I'm not a good speller,
I'm not a good athlete.

260
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,258
I'm not the brother
with the good butt.

261
00:12:47,914 --> 00:12:49,991
I can never be in charge.

262
00:12:53,464 --> 00:12:55,531
Well, not in charge of people.

263
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:57,665
But of...

264
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:58,844
toys.

265
00:12:59,086 --> 00:13:00,093
Maybe animals.

266
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:03,690
What about the dog that got away?

267
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,156
Okay, well, toys.

268
00:13:08,432 --> 00:13:10,115
I tried to think of other stuff,

269
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,554
but I ran out of time.

270
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:13,819
Randy, there's Frank.

271
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,482
Great.

272
00:13:15,582 --> 00:13:18,276
The reason I feel so stupid
in the first place.

273
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:21,521
And let me guess, he's not going to
trip over that rock that always gets me.

274
00:13:23,683 --> 00:13:25,165
Walked right over it like the fonz.

275
00:13:26,343 --> 00:13:27,460
Randy, let's go.

276
00:13:37,501 --> 00:13:39,246
You use your dumb brother
to escape, too?

277
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,797
Where you been?
I've been looking for you.

278
00:13:46,103 --> 00:13:47,801
I'm not ready to talk to you yet.

279
00:13:47,964 --> 00:13:49,347
Frank, I got to take you back.

280
00:13:50,373 --> 00:13:53,526
I know you're looking for Paco's money
in that heater, but it's over.

281
00:13:54,245 --> 00:13:55,883
No, I was actually looking for my gun.

282
00:14:00,979 --> 00:14:03,902
<i>The only thing more frustrating
to Joy than not being in labor,</i>

283
00:14:04,255 --> 00:14:06,152
<i>was the fact that
her husband suddenly was.</i>

284
00:14:06,275 --> 00:14:09,254
I've got to stop walking.
My contractions are two minutes apart.

285
00:14:09,554 --> 00:14:11,253
Hurts being a woman,
don't it, Darnell?

286
00:14:11,408 --> 00:14:12,957
I'm not sure what's about to happen,

287
00:14:13,044 --> 00:14:15,150
but I know it's going to need
to happen over water.

288
00:14:16,043 --> 00:14:17,283
That was a bad one.

289
00:14:20,038 --> 00:14:21,415
What the hell is going on?

290
00:14:21,691 --> 00:14:22,900
Did you break out?

291
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:25,180
Not exactly, but he did.

292
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,241
- Sorry.
- All right, everyone just chill out.

293
00:14:28,624 --> 00:14:30,139
Damn, my horoscope was right.

294
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:31,639
You better put that gun down.

295
00:14:31,945 --> 00:14:33,697
If you kill a hot blonde
9 months pregnant

296
00:14:33,985 --> 00:14:36,291
with her bi-racial
half sister's bi-racial baby,

297
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:39,470
Nancy Grace'll convict you in the media
before the first commercial break.

298
00:14:39,703 --> 00:14:42,495
If you have to kill somebody,
kill Earl or Randy first.

299
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:43,780
- What?
- I deserve it.

300
00:14:44,061 --> 00:14:46,414
I just want to find my money.
You, come on.

301
00:14:46,745 --> 00:14:48,718
- Help me pull the stove out.
- I can't...

302
00:14:48,853 --> 00:14:51,721
If I strain too hard, I'm afraid
I'll give birth to pooptuplets.

303
00:14:52,003 --> 00:14:53,363
Here comes another wave.

304
00:14:53,817 --> 00:14:54,818
Kill him third.

305
00:14:54,966 --> 00:14:57,670
I don't want to kill anyone.
I just want my money, all right?

306
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,154
Now you, preggers, come on,
help me move this thing.

307
00:15:01,145 --> 00:15:02,634
Joy, cops are on their way.

308
00:15:02,714 --> 00:15:04,748
They're going to help me
get my property back.

309
00:15:05,349 --> 00:15:07,089
You called the cops?

310
00:15:07,372 --> 00:15:09,516
Damn, my horoscope was right.

311
00:15:12,387 --> 00:15:15,170
Check it out. We're chained to
the refrigerator, can you believe it?

312
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,513
Okay, everyone shut up
while me and the fat chick

313
00:15:17,594 --> 00:15:19,287
move this thing
before the cops get here.

314
00:15:19,548 --> 00:15:20,847
Oh! Snap!

315
00:15:21,165 --> 00:15:23,769
I'm sorry, pregnant chick,
but seriously, pull, bitch, pull.

316
00:15:23,849 --> 00:15:25,283
No, my water just broke!

317
00:15:25,602 --> 00:15:28,423
Oh, that's nasty!
That soaked right through to the sock.

318
00:15:28,576 --> 00:15:31,674
- We've got to get her to a hospital!
- Nobody is going anywhere!

319
00:15:31,954 --> 00:15:35,128
Ray-ray, I'm freaking out.
Get me a sedative from my purse.

320
00:15:35,398 --> 00:15:37,515
- Can I get a handful of those?
- I'd like one!

321
00:15:37,775 --> 00:15:39,474
- That sounds good.
- Can I have one?

322
00:15:39,735 --> 00:15:42,024
Actually, you know what,
hold onto it for me till later.

323
00:15:42,104 --> 00:15:43,436
I kind of need to think sharp.

324
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,844
Hell no! If I can't have drugs,
neither can y'all.

325
00:15:47,456 --> 00:15:48,495
Oh, crap.

326
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,380
The cops are here.
I have placentas on my feet.

327
00:15:51,837 --> 00:15:54,155
You know what?
This ain't my day, I'm out.

328
00:15:55,815 --> 00:15:56,986
Don't turn yourself in.

329
00:15:57,338 --> 00:15:59,807
- What are you doing, Earl?
- The warden said no cops.

330
00:16:00,088 --> 00:16:01,996
You're doing a good job.
You've got a gun,

331
00:16:02,315 --> 00:16:03,746
you've got us all held hostage.

332
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:06,205
You can't quit now,
you haven't even found your money yet.

333
00:16:06,471 --> 00:16:07,694
Earl, what are you doing?

334
00:16:07,929 --> 00:16:09,751
If he wants to turn himself in, just...

335
00:16:10,726 --> 00:16:12,313
- Oh, god.
- Shut up, Darnell!

336
00:16:12,602 --> 00:16:15,340
You stole my drugs,
you are not stealing my limelight.

337
00:16:15,571 --> 00:16:18,104
I believe in you, Frank,
just believe in yourself.

338
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,855
Yeah, thanks for the pep talk, Earl,
you know, people...

339
00:16:23,185 --> 00:16:24,310
people don't realize

340
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:27,410
that hostage situations are stressful
on both sides of the gun.

341
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,077
People don't realize that.

342
00:16:29,507 --> 00:16:30,907
You know what? You're right.

343
00:16:31,113 --> 00:16:32,357
I am good at this.

344
00:16:32,911 --> 00:16:34,140
And you know what else?

345
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,282
I do have something going on for me.

346
00:16:36,751 --> 00:16:40,636
Yeah, you two, tank tops,
go ditch the cops, go on!

347
00:16:42,674 --> 00:16:45,271
Yeah, you see?
Now we're doing it.

348
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:50,795
- I'm here about a stolen baby.
- She's about to give it back.

349
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:52,877
Yeah, so it's kind
of a mute point now.

350
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:56,482
"Moot" point, you said mute with a "u,"
the word's "moot," m-o-o-t.

351
00:16:56,771 --> 00:16:57,771
I think it's mute point,

352
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,637
like there's no point in talking
about it anymore, so it's "mute."

353
00:16:59,905 --> 00:17:01,044
Trust me, it's "moot."

354
00:17:01,426 --> 00:17:03,757
No, he's right,
mute makes sense.

355
00:17:04,037 --> 00:17:05,329
Moot, what's moot?

356
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,607
I didn't know it's possible,
but I think my water just broke.

357
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:13,432
- Short breaths, Darnell.
- You need me to call an ambulance?

358
00:17:13,721 --> 00:17:15,955
Nah, he's just riding out
some contractions.

359
00:17:16,254 --> 00:17:17,278
What was that?

360
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,624
That's just his wife
giving birth to my baby.

361
00:17:23,363 --> 00:17:26,113
Look, brother, I don't know
what's going on inside that trailer,

362
00:17:26,805 --> 00:17:30,785
I suggest you do like I'm about to do
and distance yourself from these people.

363
00:17:36,647 --> 00:17:37,902
Come on, Darnell.

364
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:42,738
Bingo! I got my money!

365
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,407
Look out whore houses in Mexico!

366
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,992
Cop's gone.

367
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,953
Do I have permission
to use the restroom now?

368
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,538
I don't care what you do, home slice,
'coz I'm about to go...

369
00:17:51,632 --> 00:17:52,849
I see fingers!

370
00:17:54,287 --> 00:17:56,501
Give me a towel,
the coupon scissors and a chip clip.

371
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,738
You better be fixing to open
a bag of fritos, Mac Gyver.

372
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,353
I've done this before. I once performed
a caesarean on my cat, Miss Kitty.

373
00:18:02,711 --> 00:18:05,446
Did the kittens live?
Screw the kittens, did mama cat make it?

374
00:18:05,605 --> 00:18:07,119
I was 9,
I did the best I could.

375
00:18:31,449 --> 00:18:33,211
She's so beautiful.

376
00:18:39,696 --> 00:18:41,964
<i>The birth of a child
is a powerful thing.</i>

377
00:18:44,828 --> 00:18:46,375
<i>Even frank was moved.</i>

378
00:18:48,581 --> 00:18:50,726
It's been months
since I've seen a vagina

379
00:18:50,818 --> 00:18:52,641
that wasn't crudely drawn on my hand.

380
00:19:01,556 --> 00:19:03,042
I should get going.

381
00:19:24,077 --> 00:19:26,804
You were right, Randy.
We did need the search dog.

382
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,300
So I guess I am good
at some stuff, huh, Earl?

383
00:19:29,454 --> 00:19:31,736
Like knowing when to use
a dog on a man hunt,

384
00:19:31,843 --> 00:19:33,773
and breaking freezer doors
off refrigerators.

385
00:19:34,248 --> 00:19:36,009
Yeah, that was a real feat of strength.

386
00:19:40,835 --> 00:19:42,367
You might not have seen this,

387
00:19:42,505 --> 00:19:44,354
but when Frank was waving
his gun all around,

388
00:19:44,441 --> 00:19:47,296
I was standing in front of you
so he couldn't hit you with the bullet.

389
00:19:47,376 --> 00:19:49,031
Yeah, you're a real good bullet shield.

390
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:53,673
So I guess it's okay that I'm not good
at being in charge, because you are.

391
00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:57,343
Well, I'm only good
'cause I've got you on my team.

392
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,157
Thanks.

393
00:20:00,971 --> 00:20:02,797
I lied about being your bullet shield.

394
00:20:02,895 --> 00:20:04,905
I was only standing in front of you
on accident.

395
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:08,226
I know, Randy.
It's cool.

396
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,365
But just 'cause someone follows

397
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:16,767
doesn't mean they don't have
plenty to contribute,

398
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,581
whether they're little brothers

399
00:20:18,961 --> 00:20:20,505
or big sisters.

400
00:20:22,196 --> 00:20:24,377
- What's this?
- It's Frank's money.

401
00:20:24,684 --> 00:20:27,082
There's a couple thousand
in there for ray-ray-ray-anne.

402
00:20:27,203 --> 00:20:30,212
She's going to need it for college,
or a boob job in case she's not smart.

403
00:20:32,282 --> 00:20:33,948
All right, kids, time to eat.

404
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:36,786
<i>And sometimes,
people don't want to stop contributing.</i>

405
00:20:36,866 --> 00:20:39,029
Wait, 5 more minutes.
We're in the middle of a game.

406
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:41,278
Okay, black one, your turn.
