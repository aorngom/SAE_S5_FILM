<font color=#38B0DE>Dexter
Season 1 Episode 7</font>

4
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,870
previously on "dexter"...

5
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,160
It is my new friend.

6
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,310
When he broke into my apartment, 
he took some time to get to know me

7
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,980
my life, my secrets.

8
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,330
Same as the others --no blood.

9
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,680
Somebody who was herelast night saw something.

10
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:08,200
They got a night watchman,
but we can't find him.

11
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,360
It's the guard -- tucci.

12
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,440
I think he's alive.

13
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,360
Taking tucciover to county.

14
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,530
Rudy here is gonna put 
meback together again.

15
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,030
Yo,pretty boy,you're 
stealing my thunder.

16
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,370
I don't know.

17
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,160
I just might have tofight you for this one.

18
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,030
How about you focus onwhether or not he was the 
man you saw at the old hospitalthat night,mr. Perry?

19
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,300
It was difficult to tell.It was dark.

20
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,630
Florida prisons kick free 
25,000 inmates a year.

21
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,390
I search for the ones who 
think they beat the system,

22
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,180
like jeremy downs.

23
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,890
Jeremy got off easy.

24
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,350
To the coroner,the knife 
strokes looked random,

25
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,110
but I saw the work 
of a young virtuoso.

26
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,220
Are you gonna fuck me,faggot?

27
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,970
'Cause I killedthe 
last guy who raped me.

28
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,670
I understand now.

29
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,760
Jeremy didn't murder 
that boy four years ago.

30
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,550
He was taking out the garbage.

31
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,350
Wait,is that all?

32
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,830
<i>Cirle of Friends </i>

33
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,650
The fbi estimates that there are less than 50 
serial killers active in the united states today.

34
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,640
We don't get together at conventions,

35
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,470
share trade secrets,or 
exchange christmas cards...

36
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,420
but sometimes I wonder what 
it's like for the others.

37
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,400
The only sound I hear,

38
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,630
the only sound in the entire world...

39
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,490
...is my heart beating.

40
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,550
I swear to christ,morgan,after this case,

41
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,860
I'm submitting your assfor 
psychiatric evaluation.

42
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,740
I'm just retracingcastoff patterns,

43
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,070
directionality angles.

44
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,410
Can you tell us what 
happened here or not?

45
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,660
It's an execution.

46
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,670
The kid's an honor student,
editor of his school yearbook.

47
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,260
It's all in the knife work.

48
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,740
It's skillful,no wasted motion. 
The killer had experience.

49
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,760
Every strokehit a major artery...

50
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,550
or at least came close.

51
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,330
Are you getting a god 
damn hard-on there,morgan?

52
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,430
No,it's truly horrific. 
He was yearbook committee,you said?

53
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,230
I want your reporton this tomorrow.

54
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,560
I wish I could say sergeant doakes is my 
biggest problem right now, but he's not.

55
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,560
I've seen these wounds before.

56
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,500
You're droolingon laguerta's couch.

57
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,780
You pullinga midnight shift?

58
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,210
Lopez has the trots.
Why are you still here?

59
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,820
Why not? Nothing at home except 
an emptyfridge and an empty bed.

60
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,880
If I wasn't marriedand 
10 years younger...

61
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,010
I'd still be in high 
school.Keep dreaming.

62
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,150
Wiseass.

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,590
I've been chasing leadson 
the ice-truck killer.

64
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,320
Pathetic long shots,mostly.

65
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,780
Yeah?What kind of leads?

66
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,440
I looked at the research. 
With mass murderers,

67
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,380
it's dumbshit that trips them up.

68
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,670
Son of sam got a parking ticket 
outside his own crime scene.

69
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,980
So you ranparking violations 
at the crime scenesof our guy?

70
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,390
Smart.

71
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,540
Yeah,but none of the registere 
downers had criminal records.

72
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,850
Try "moving violations."

73
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,320
Timothy mcveigh drove waytoo 
fast on the way out of town.

74
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,910
Neil perry --I know that name.

75
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,960
Yeah,he came forwardas a 
witness two weeks ago

76
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,140
when pieces of tony tucciwere 
showing up around town.

77
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:17,460
He rode through a stop sign two blocksfrom 
the third crime scene at the seven seas motel.

78
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,600
Why woulda voluntary witness 
be at two separatecrime scenes?

79
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,550
I don't know. Maybe he 
waschopping up hookers.

80
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,970
Holy mother of fuck,is this him?

81
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,260
Let's find out.

82
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,170
Are you surethis is the right address?

83
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,060
According to dmv,this is where perry lives.

84
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,980
With his seven inbred 
cousins,by the look of it.

85
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,300
Somethinghas got to be wrong with 
somebody that can livein a steel box.

86
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,290
Aluminum,actually.

87
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,800
Nina and I hada deluxe multisectional.

88
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,730
- For real?  
- It was our starter home.

89
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,290
This is our car.

90
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,740
One of the victimswas seen getting in a wood-paneled 
station wagon on the night of her death.

91
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,560
Let's take one step at a 
time.Let's find our guy.

92
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:04,180
According to his files, he works 
as a computer analystfor miami lake.

93
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,330
Look up...slowly.

94
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,850
All right,take the front door. 
Cover all the exits.

95
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,810
- I'm going to the back.  
- ok

96
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,740
Open up,perry!It's the police!

97
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,020
Open up,perry!Police!

98
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,920
Open up,perry!

99
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,250
Open the door!

100
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,780
Hey,angel,I got him!

101
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,330
Wait!Stop running,perry!

102
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,600
Get the fuck down!

103
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,350
Fuck!

104
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,220
I knew I recognized the 
knife work of the killer.

105
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,200
Jeremy downs.

106
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,520
I had him.

107
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,330
He was mine...

108
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,690
until I found out the boy 
jeremy killed raped him...

109
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,900
*******

110
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,040
so I let jeremy go. 

111
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,400
It seemed fair.

112
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,760
But my random act of kindness was misguided.

113
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,070
If I had followed my instincts,

114
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,470
this boy's high-school yearbook 
would still have an editor.

115
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:48,600
the task force will tear apartthe house for any 
evidence that links neil perryto the ice-truck murders.

116
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,800
We need proof this time,
people -- tangible proof.

117
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,620
What is it?

118
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,540
They really foundthe ice-truck killer?

119
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,850
I did.

120
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:03,490
Yes,yes.We will financially guaranteeex 
tradition from anywhere. James?

121
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,110
Yeah,I'm on it,lieutenant.
I'll run the task force.

122
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,270
actuly I need you and pullman to stay 
with the knife victimin the alley.

123
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,180
His parentsare high-profile.

124
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,450
Hi, Whatever you need.

125
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,390
Angel... you found perry.
You run the task force.

126
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,780
Contact the fugitive'sfriends,family,

127
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,420
co-workers,coke dealer anybody 
who might tryto hide him.

128
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,730
You want usto circulate his photo?

129
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,160
In neighborhoods only.
Keep it away from the media.

130
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,590
This case stays low-profile.

131
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,360
The last thing I need is 
anothertony tucci on my hands.

132
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,900
Anything else,lieutenant?

133
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,460
Yes --choose task-force members who 
can puttheir regular duties aside

134
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,180
and bust ass untilneil 
perry's apprehended.

135
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:41,490
- Okay   
- Okay,that's all.Thank you.

136
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,270
Do you really thinkthis is the guy?

137
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,580
It's all lining up.

138
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:49,040
I saw him,dex.I chased him.

139
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,730
Debra morgan.

140
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,570
Get over here.You're on the team.

141
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,580
- Do you hear that? I'm on the team.  
- yeah

142
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,740
Do you think we get hats?

143
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,960
Hardly looks a guycapable 
of terrorizing miami.

144
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,800
A science camp,maybe.

145
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,550
I'm off.I'll keep you in the loop.

146
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,650
Where's my blood report,sparky

147
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,820
I'm on it,sergeant.

148
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,660
How you doing,mrs. Bennett?

149
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,090
Hey,charlie.Where are the kids?

150
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,760
Your husband swung bya few 
minutes ago. He didn't tell you?

151
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,940
I never seen codylight 
up like that before.

152
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,330
Big treat --the old man coming down.

153
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,390
Wait,wait. Wait.Paul?

154
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,710
Yeah.He just picked up the kids.

155
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,070
You gave my childrento paul?

156
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,680
Are you stupid?

157
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:49,100
I told the administrative officethat cody and 
astor are not to be releasedinto his custody!

158
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,250
Well,nobody told me.

159
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,470
He just got outof fucking jail!

160
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,690
Everyone,follow strict,sterile protocol.

161
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,900
There will be no contamination 
of my crime scene.

162
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,130
Bag anything that could be used 
to murder or disposeof a human body.

163
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,210
That's pretty mucheverything in here,boss.

164
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,820
Except this.

165
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,600
He's a sick fuck.

166
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,400
Some might say that.

167
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,270
To others,crypto-taxidermy is a fine art.

168
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,490
I got a mummifiedchupacabra at home.

169
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,280
Can I have permissionto run masuka's 
prints as the ice-truck killer?

170
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,510
No need for that.

171
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,160
I'll give yousome warm dna right now.

172
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,520
God,you're gross.
I didn't hear that.

173
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:35,180
Detective,I found something.

174
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,400
An archive of hidden files.

175
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,550
A lot of how-to documents --

176
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,520
draining blood from cattle,
wartime amputation techniques.

177
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,750
"Butcheringthe human carcass"?

178
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,320
There's even an article about countries 
thatdon't extradite to the U.S.

179
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,440
We got this fucker.

180
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,830
We got jack shit,morgan.

181
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,450
Everything in hereis circumstantial. 
We needsome hard evidence.

182
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,130
Hey,I'm not donelooking yet. Are you?

183
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:02,560
The school had no rightto 
release my children to paul.

184
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,940
- No,they didn'T.   
- He lost his custody rights

185
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,660
right around the time my 
headhit the living room wall.

186
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,140
I would think so.

187
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,620
I-I should be outlooking for my kids.

188
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:15,010
Rita,the best thingyou could do for the 
kids is stay herein case he tries to call.

189
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,780
What if he doesn't?

190
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:21,050
I mean,what if he kidnapped them to 
get back at mefor putting him in jail?

191
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,370
Dexter,I --

192
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,810
Hi.

193
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,250
Astor!

194
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,650
Mom,look -- it's dad.He came home.

195
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,880
Yeah.

196
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,890
What,you think I wasgonna move to the moon?

197
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,620
Stop it.Just stop.

198
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,080
Do you know I called the police?

199
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,500
Why? I told you I was 
taking them to the carnival.

200
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,130
No,you didn'T.

201
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,870
Rita,I called youat the hotel.

202
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,040
They saidyou were on a break,

203
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:54,800
so I left a message withthe 
info and my cell number.

204
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,760
Uh,hi.How are you? 

205
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:05,820
I'm paul bennett,father on parole.

206
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,440
Uh,dexter morgan.

207
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:12,000
Uh,I can't thinkof anything clever to say.

208
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,800
Paul,this is unacceptable.

209
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,550
I-I have custody. You can't just 
take themwithout my permission.

210
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,750
I cameto see my babies.

211
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,450
I missed them,rita.

212
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,560
I missed a lot of things.

213
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,880
I should phone the station,
call off the dogs.

214
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,830
Dexter,look --my dad's home.

215
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,990
Yeah,I see that,buddy.

216
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,790
Hey,angel. You're the 
experton manufactured living.

217
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,090
This closet looka little small to you?

218
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,690
A little.

219
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,200
Sweet.

220
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,110
I've gotnewspaper articles.

221
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,730
"Dismembered bodyfound in a pool."

222
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,960
"Ice-truck killerappalls miami."

223
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,370
This is a recordof everything he's ever done.

224
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,710
I got photos.

225
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,700
- Did we release those photosto the press?   
- No.

226
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:51,500
- Did he take them himself?   
- He had to.

227
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:54,150
- Did we just hitthe mother lode?  
- No.

228
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,420
We hit the motherfuckingmother lode.

229
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,910
Oh,my god

230
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,550
the evidence just keep 
spiling up at the mobile home.

231
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,630
I just authorized an 
excavation of the back patio.

232
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,530
I think there's somethingburied there.

233
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,380
What are we doingto find neil perry?

234
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:11,380
I put his name in the automated 
system and notified e fbi.

235
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,590
Airports on alert?

236
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,810
Airports,train stations,bus lines.

237
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,020
We should trackhis credit cards.

238
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,930
Already done,along with 
A.T.M.Sand bank accounts.

239
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,130
I also put a tapon his home phone.

240
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,090
Seems you thoughtof everything.

241
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,980
It seems that way.

242
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,860
- Look,maria   
- no need to apologize.

243
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,940
I don't require your approvalto do my job.

244
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,060
I know that.

245
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,620
I've been kicking your ass 
'cause I knewyou had this in you.

246
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:46,980
Well,thank you for making 
me the woman I am today.

247
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,050
I love you to everything.

248
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,850
I love youto everything,too.

249
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,850
He's not gonnahit you anymore.

250
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,820
He told me at the carnival.

251
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,860
I made him promise.

252
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,860
Thank you,baby.

253
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:22,670
I haven't had time to 
process as much as the kids.

254
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,330
I mean,paul was supposed to 
belocked up for another year.

255
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,520
Cody seemsto be processing okay.

256
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,380
Cody's too young.

257
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,960
A dad's just a concept 
to him,not a person.

258
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:40,070
But astor -- she remembers
what he put us through.

259
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,370
Well,at leastyou're not married anymore.

260
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,440
That's just it.

261
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:50,550
Technically,we are.

262
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,830
When paul went to prison,
I started divorce proceedings,

263
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,900
but he refusedto sign the paperwork.

264
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,920
As a power play?

265
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,840
I don't think so.

266
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,140
I think for all the 
darkness that haunts him,

267
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:06,280
paul loves having a family.

268
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,240
I think he's just afraidto let go.

269
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,720
When did youfirst notice it?

270
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:17,410
This darknessinside 
the guy you fell for.

271
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:24,930
I always knewit was there. 
I guess I just didn't thinkI deserved better...

272
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,400
till I met you.

273
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,720
I have a dark side,too.

274
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,160
What? I do.

275
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,490
Somehow I doubt that.

276
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,200
You have a good heart,dexter.

277
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:51,790
You're not like paul.
You don't hurt people.

278
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,120
Innocent people.

279
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,880
I don't hurtinnocent people.

280
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,360
Hey,dude,the bowling 
alley'saround the corner.

281
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,940
Hey,I'm lookingfor jeremy downs.

282
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,100
Jeremy?

283
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:43,700
He vacatedthe premises!

284
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,290
Focus.

285
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,570
I'm trying to find jeremy.

286
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,790
Oh,I get it.

287
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:57,270
Look,man,I'm not 
reallyinto that homo shit,

288
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,300
but I'm kind of shorton money for weed,

289
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:03,550
so I guess I'll do it for 
lessthan jeremy's charging.

290
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,640
Wait.What does jeremy charge?

291
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,550
Jeremy's selling himself?

292
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,900
I mean,he's always hanging outwith the 
brokeback boys down at flamingo park.

293
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,750
Comes backwith fistfuls of cash.

294
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,260
It's me. Get your ass overto neil perry's place.

295
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,340
You're gonnawant to see this.

296
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,870
Deb,it's my day off.

297
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,150
Just get your ass over here.

298
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,590
We're about to bust open the 
goods on the ice-truck killer.

299
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,000
Not what I expected.

300
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,520
So lifelike.

301
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,470
Hey,dex.

302
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,200
I thoughtyou'd want to be here.

303
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,390
Something's buried down there.
Masuka's been digging all night.

304
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,030
I hate to break thisto you,deb,

305
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,880
but you know you've got
the wrong guy here,right?

306
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,050
The ice-truck killer drains
the blood from his victims,

307
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,910
freezes their bodies, 
and only then severstheir limbs.

308
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,100
It's clean and efficient 
his psychological signature.

309
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,230
Neil perry,on the other 
hand,stuffs roadkill.

310
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,080
Yeah,and turns it into 
fucked-up fantasy shit.

311
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,820
But the fantasiesare all wrong.

312
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,480
The guy we're looking 
for wouldn't turn dead,

313
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,510
dirty things into living cartoons. 
He'd find that pathetic.

314
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,470
How do you know?

315
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,100
Because it is pathetic.

316
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,590
Deb,trust me.
Neil perry is not a killer.

317
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,820
He's a dabbler.He's a waste of time.

318
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,350
If the guy we're looking for took 
his early fantasies outon animals, 

319
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,980
he'd bury them. *************

320
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,760
And want aboutan early human kill?

321
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,800
Wod he bury that,too?

322
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:23,900
Sure. Probably.

323
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,840
En turn around.

324
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,880
You were saying?

325
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:31,200
It looks likean adult female.

326
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,140
Any idea how longthe 
body's been down there?

327
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,620
Based on decomposition,

328
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:38,050
she's been tits upfor two,
maybe three years.

329
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,950
We'll know moreafter the autopsy.

330
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,740
What happened to the limbs? 
Did they rot off?

331
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:46,000
No. They're clean cuts.

332
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,730
But he didn't chop upthe whole body.

333
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,790
This could beperry's first kill,

334
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,340
like he was experimenting.

335
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:56,230
You're the expert,dex. 
What do you thk?

336
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,760
Sure. Sounds good.

337
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:03,060
Actually,it sounds perfectly awful.

338
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,060
For weeks,I've felt like a 
student in a master class.

339
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:10,520
Is it really possible that 
the master's on the run?

340
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,440
And even more tragic,
does he live in a double-wide?

341
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,980
The gravitrongoes so fast,mom.

342
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:22,130
My dad took me on itthree times.

343
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,300
Wow.Is that so?

344
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,860
All right,let mecut you 
guys up some fruit.

345
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:30,980
Astor wouldn't go.She was afraid.

346
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,930
So what?I don't like fast rides.

347
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:41,390
Hello?

348
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,500
- Who wants doughnuts?   
- I do.

349
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,210
Paul,you can't just walk 
in here whenever you want.

350
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,280
You don't live hereanymore.

351
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,870
Oh. Sorry about that.Old habits.

352
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,310
I'll ring the doorbellnext time.

353
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,980
I got these for you.

354
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,650
All right. I'll just put 
them in,uh,something.

355
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,740
Dad,can I havea doughnut?

356
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,340
You got it,buddy.Coming up.

357
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,670
What,n-now you're making 
me out mto be the bad guy?

358
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,290
They haven'thad breakfast yet.

359
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:20,900
You know what? Kidlet,
my bad.Sorry about that.

360
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:23,290
These doughnutsare for after school.

361
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,800
But I could whip up
some eggs and pancakes.

362
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,700
- Paul!  
- Very little syrup,I promise.

363
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:31,130
- And meat.You into neat?  
- Uh-huh.

364
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:36,630
I like meat on my feet.
It's real squishy.

365
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,240
Paul.

366
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,890
You can't do thisanymore,paul.

367
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,940
What?! What?!

368
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,450
Help raise my kids?!

369
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,820
Yes,I can.That's my job.

370
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,340
All right,look.

371
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,660
I-I can't evenbegin to understand 
how difficult this has beenfor you,

372
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,880
rita, being a single mom,okay?

373
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:06,230
A-and for that,I-I'm eternally sorry.

374
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,470
I let you down.

375
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:13,320
I let everybody down.

376
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:20,210
But if I could justfind that frying pan.

377
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,500
Astor...

378
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:24,190
want to help mefind the frying pan?

379
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,020
We got a profile of neil perry.

380
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,670
He's a computer expert.

381
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,870
I.Q. -- Off the chart.
He's a loner,no priors.

382
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,570
His father split when he was 6.

383
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,540
His motherwas an alcoholic,abusive,

384
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:45,120
and possibly his first victim.

385
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,590
Roberta perry.

386
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,920
Dental records say she was
the one under the patio.

387
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:54,630
Now,neil kept her death quiet by cashing her 
social-security checks for the last twyears,

388
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,590
but he did not kill her for the money.

389
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,020
Morgan?

390
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,570
We think he wanted release.

391
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,740
Roberta perryran her son's life,

392
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,720
controlled him,beat him as a kid.

393
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,580
We think he dreamtabout 
killing her for years.

394
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,680
I just spoke with perry's 
cellphone provider.

395
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:09,930
Can they track his location?

396
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,750
No signal, he probably
turned off his phone.

397
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,500
But,according to records,

398
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:16,930
he used it on some of the nights 
the ice-truck killer victimswere taken.

399
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,980
Who did he call?

400
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:20,010
Voice mail,mostly,checking messages.

401
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,910
Verizon triangulatedthe location.

402
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,890
All the calls camefrom the same place --

403
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,950
a six-block areaon southwest 8th street.

404
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,640
yeah,The tamiami trail.

405
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:31,390
That strip'sfull of no-tell motels. 
It's like a happyhunting ground for hookers.

406
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,210
There's a good chance that's
where he's killing his victims.

407
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,510
Let's recanvass the areafor leads.

408
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,880
Now that we've gota photo of this guy,

409
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:40,770
maybe we can find somebodywho actually saw him.

410
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,560
Let's go.

411
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,780
You're startingto look like her.

412
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:48,010
Want to stop by your house,
check in with the family?

413
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,690
I'd rather check inwith your brother.

414
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,790
His instincts are usually
pretty good on this stuff.

415
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,060
Yeah,not today.He'd 
just piss on our parade.

416
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,060
He needs his day off.

417
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,130
The first time I saw his work,

418
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,780
I felt like a spanish explorer landing 
of the shores of the new world.

419
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,770
No blood in the victims,

420
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,280
no spatter,no stain.

421
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,050
Deb is wrong about him.

422
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,710
It's okay. Hell,I've made mistakes.

423
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:18,980
In fact,I'm about to 
correct a big one right now.

424
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,940
Jeremy downs.

425
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,140
Hey,you want company?

426
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,910
Just keep walkingand looking ahead.

427
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:32,260
There's some mangrovesover by 
the lake. We can go in there.

428
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:35,230
It's too public.My car's 
in the parking lot.

429
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,900
Are your windows tinted?

430
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,990
I said,"eyes front."

431
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,680
What's wrong?

432
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,830
Shit. Shit.

433
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,960
Get the fuck out of my way!

434
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:56,070
Take it easy,jeremy!
Stay right there!

435
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,710
Take him down!Take him down!

436
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,290
Hands behind your back.

437
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,960
Stand up!Stand up!

438
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,350
Pink motel

439
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:19,460
Miami metro P.D.
Can we have a minute?

440
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,010
Yeah.

441
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,860
This guy look familiar?

442
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,270
I don't know.

443
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,820
They come. They go.You get it?

444
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,630
They "come."

445
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,330
Look,my feet are aching
from pounding the pavement.

446
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,130
You thinkyou could help us out?

447
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,080
What's your name?

448
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:37,440
Laline consuelo garci* gixez.

449
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,160
Laline...

450
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:45,190
oxzghte del hombre que 
le dicen el ice-truck killer?

451
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,190
S?

452
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,760
Puede ser el.

453
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,930
So let's try this again.

454
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,590
Have you seen this man?

455
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,290
He's a regular. Rents a 
roomby the month -- cash.

456
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,500
When was the last timehe was here?

457
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,340
He's here now. He brought a 
girl to his roomthis morning.

458
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,710
A working girl? A hooker?

459
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,180
- who has to guess   
- What's the room number?

460
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,620
20. Here's the master.

461
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:09,120
Call for backup. Let's hope 
this girlis still alive.

462
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,290
Do we wait for tactical?

463
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,740
yeah, Not with a 
possible victimin there.

464
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,610
Clear.

465
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:33,560
It's okay. We're here now.You're safe.

466
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,790
Please get me out hurry, 
before he comes back!

467
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,790
Where is he?

468
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,230
Please,I want to get out!

469
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,070
Where was he going?

470
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,530
The liquor store.He said 
he's coming right back.

471
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,320
What?

472
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:56,680
Hey,where's doakes? He paged me.

473
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,980
We need your reportfrom 
that kid in the alley.

474
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:03,080
But it's my day off. I was just 
at don shula'sfamous golf course.

475
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:05,070
Did you finishyour report or not?

476
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,430
Yeah,it's in my lab.

477
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,030
Wait.

478
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,760
I'm on to you.

479
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,790
Excuse me?

480
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,070
Your crazy-ass,knife-slashing
two-step in the alley.

481
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,090
You were right.

482
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,480
You said the killerhad 
previous experience. He did.

483
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,810
Oh. Really?

484
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:27,230
Masuka lifted a printfrom the 
alley that matched a kidfrom juvie.

485
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,770
Cut up a victim five years ago.
Same knife technique.

486
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,790
We just grabbed himat flamin go park.

487
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:35,080
Great work,sergeant.

488
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:38,000
Yeah.Your instincts were dead-on.

489
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:41,510
They're always dead-onwhen it 
comes to killers. Why is that?

490
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,100
I'll just go getthat report.

491
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,020
I'm watching you.

492
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,060
Miss me?

493
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,840
Police.On the ground. 

494
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:06,060
Get down slowly.

495
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:15,200
Now the day is over 
night is drawing nigh 

496
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,320
get down!

497
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:21,710
The shadows of the evening 
steal across the sky

498
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,340
I said get the fuck down!

499
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,730
Now the darkness gathers

500
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,790
facedown ,let's go! 

501
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:38,000
birds and beasts and 
flowers soon will be asleep

502
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,780
what else do you want to 
put in the concoction?

503
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,760
Gummi bears.

504
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:48,810
How do you two plan to eat 
that,spread it on toast?

505
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,340
It alreadyhas toast in it.

506
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:54,050
Sot does.

507
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,520
Keep mashing.I'll get the door.

508
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:03,160
Oh.Hey,there,big guy.

509
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:06,360
Uh,dexter,right?

510
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:08,340
Paul,hi.Rita's not here.

511
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:11,380
Oh,that's okay.I'm 
actually here for the kids.

512
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:13,840
I came to dazzle 
them with my booty.

513
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,340
This booty.

514
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,780
This is awkward.

515
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:23,950
I'm afraid I'm not comfortable letting 
you inside the housewithout rita here.

516
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,950
Who are you,anyway,
like,the babysitter?

517
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,350
I'm watching the kidsright now,

518
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,530
so I suppose that 
makes me the baby sitter.

519
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:39,760
Are you fucking my wife?

520
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,500
I'll let rita knowyou stopped by.

521
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:44,660
Or I could just walk in.It's my house.

522
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:47,450
I own this place. I bet she 
didn't tell you that,did she?

523
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,390
Homeowner issuesare way over my head.

524
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,630
I should probablyjust call the 
police, let them sort this out.

525
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,760
- Is that it?  
- Yeah.

526
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:14,530
Yeah,why don't yougive those presents 
to my little bucketsof sunshine,

527
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,170
tell rita she can reach 
meat the motor court?

528
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,060
Okay.

529
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,600
He might be a crack-addled,
wife-abusing yahoo,

530
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:26,330
but he refuses to abandon his kids.

531
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,410
I'm not sure that's a good thing.

532
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,630
Take him on in.I'll be right there.

533
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,420
You got it.

534
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:42,390
Congratulations.

535
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,540
You just brought downthe most notorious 
serial killer in florida history.

536
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:48,650
Fucking "A."He's in booking right now.

537
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,800
It sucksyou weren't a part of this.

538
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:55,250
I mean,you and me -- we 
pavedthe way for this,right?

539
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,670
I'm cool.I've got my own bad guy.

540
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,940
Listen,I just picked up a 
message from tony tucci.

541
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:05,330
Our favoritefun-loving amputee's 
getting out of the hospital.

542
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,820
There's a party tonight.

543
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:09,190
- No,thanks. 
- I don't want to go,either.

544
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,860
But the guy lost body parts, 
and we get to tell himwe caught the guy.

545
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,470
come on, What else you got going on?

546
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,340
Wouldn't you like to know?

547
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,630
There will be hookers there.

548
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:22,440
All right.Fine,mr. Grumpy 
head. Have it your way.

549
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,460
Did he threaten you?

550
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,250
No.Nothing like that.

551
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,910
He was justmarking his territory.

552
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,240
Fucking bastard.

553
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:37,240
Only you could make
those words cute.

554
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,570
Stop it.

555
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,720
Paul said he owns this 
house. Is that true?

556
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,710
Yeah. Yeah.

557
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,190
He had it before we met.

558
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,610
I think he got it in a drug trade.

559
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,280
Dex,what am I gonna do?

560
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:58,360
I'd startby getting a divorce.

561
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,140
God,this is such a mess,
and I've dragged you into it.

562
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,630
There,there.

563
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,510
I just wish... I just wish he'd go away.

564
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,040
Why can't he just go away
and disappear forever?

565
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,690
He can do that  

566
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,040
very easily.

567
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,410
Fuck.

568
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:02,200
- We...we need to talk.  
- Yeah.

569
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:05,510
Just let me grab my heart 
up off the fucking floor.

570
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,170
Holy fuck,rita.Whew.

571
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,340
Come on in.

572
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:13,930
Uh,no. No,I-I'm good right here.

573
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:16,140
Aw,come on.

574
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,630
Don't be that way.Come on in.

575
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,420
I got a six-pack 
chilling in the cooler.

576
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:21,510
No.

577
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:24,470
No more.

578
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,380
What?

579
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,380
No more surprise 
visits to the house,

580
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,990
no more intimidatingmy friends,

581
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,750
and especiallyno more disney dad.

582
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,300
You lost your rightto be a father 
when you beatyour children's mother.

583
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,610
If you want to get to 
know a stor and cody,

584
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,230
you're gonna have to 
work for that privilege.

585
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,590
Whoa,whoa,babe,can I get a word in here?

586
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,850
No.

587
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,270
Divorce papers.

588
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,800
They're the ones you 
refused to sign in prison.

589
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:55,470
Sign them now, and I'll agree 
to supervisedvisits twice a week.

590
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,670
Show me you can do that for
six months,and then maybe --

591
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,280
maybe -- I'll think about a 
nonsupervised schedule.

592
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:05,150
Is this some kindof joke,rita?

593
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:10,210
You think you can really
make me back down?

594
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,380
No,I don'T.

595
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:14,590
But what elseam I gonna do,paul?

596
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,340
A judge put me in control. 
I'm in control now,

597
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:21,880
and I have the power to make sure
you never seeyour children again

598
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:25,130
unless you doexactly as I tell you.

599
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:30,000
Goddamn,you are fine
when you're mad.

600
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:32,370
I love the new you.

601
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,530
I do.My ass is yours to kick.

602
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,870
I deserve it.Here -- look.

603
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,600
Rita,I'm a changed man,
and I swear to god --

604
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:44,380
I am going to 
prove it to you.

605
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,390
All right. There she is.

606
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,230
Anybodybring any popcorn?

607
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,170
You got him.

608
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:06,300
Both of them.

609
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,700
Where's perry's lawyer?

610
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,880
He waived the right.

611
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:12,730
I can't hear a thing. 
Who's got the remote?

612
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:19,720
There they are 
my two colleagues... 

613
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,770
technically speaking.

614
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,120
Thankfully,one of 
them's a fraud.

615
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,760
Because you assume that.

616
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:29,060
So you can assumeI killed them.

617
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,700
You can assume
anything that you want.

618
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:38,380
The doeris merely a fiction 
that's added to the deed --the deed.

619
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:42,000
The deed is everything.

620
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,910
At least I hope he's a fraud.

621
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,940
Here's to my new hand.

622
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,520
Some say bravery is being the 
only one who knows you're afraid.

623
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:00,240
But I've worked with a lot 
of amputees,and I got to say --

624
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:03,490
I don't thinktony 
knew he was afraid.

625
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,530
Here's to one crazy bastard.

626
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,260
Kiss my atrophied ass.

627
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,000
Now for the main event.

628
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,270
Medical marijuana?

629
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,520
You wish.

630
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,530
Can you,uh,help me 
out here,rudy?

631
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,060
Look at that shit.

632
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:26,340
Half human,half machine.

633
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:28,670
But all man,baby.

634
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,120
May I have this dance?

635
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,880
Hey,buddy,you might havea 
chance with me,after all.

636
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:47,180
Oh,don't worry. There's still 
plenty enoughof me to go around.

637
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,460
So,you madethat hand and foot?

638
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,900
You did a good thing.

639
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:59,200
Tony lost a piece of himself,

640
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:01,530
and I helped him find it.

641
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:05,190
I mean,how often in life do you
get to make someone whole?

642
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,970
I wouldn't know.

643
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,240
It's like living art --what you do.

644
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:13,550
It's funnyyou should say that, 
because beforeI turned to prosthetics,

645
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:17,930
I,uh,studiedthe human form at 
the university of paris --sorbonne.

646
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:20,670
- Really?  
- Yeah.

647
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,310
Have you had dinner yet?

648
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,020
I would love to.

649
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,170
Uh,I thought I'd come
and show my support.

650
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,330
Bad timing?

651
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,530
No. No.

652
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:37,150
Um,have some champagne,sergeant.

653
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,710
See,we got blogs.

654
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,000
We got podcasts. You know,
the information won't stop.

655
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,700
It comes into your headand bleeds out your eyes,

656
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:52,830
and it's all crap,you know?

657
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:59,140
See,you got to darefor greatness 
these days to get people's attention.

658
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,670
Did I get yours?

659
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:15,410
This is worse than foreplay. 
Why doesn't she ask himany questions?

660
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:19,780
I have no ideawhat she's doing, 
but my patienceis wearing thin.

661
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:25,400
I gave jeremy a chance,
and he blew it.

662
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:30,360
Is this one going to 
disappoint me,too?

663
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,070
That's an interesting
interview technique.

664
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,170
I'm tiredof asking questions.

665
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,810
You're getting off on 
this too fucking much.

666
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:42,940
- Getting off on what?  
- The game.

667
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:45,730
I'm guessing that's why you 
didn't request a lawyer --

668
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:48,620
so you can sit here and say 
whatever shitcomes into your head.

669
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,600
Meanwhile,my assis 
spreading like cheez whiz,

670
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:53,440
waiting for you to figure 
out this isn't the fun part.

671
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,030
What are youtalking about?

672
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:01,260
We got you dead to rights.

673
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,660
But the good timeswon't 
start rolling

674
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:08,320
till you're in a courtroom 
with your ownpersonal judge ito

675
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:12,280
and court tvcarrying 
your scary-ass scowls

676
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:14,950
and crazy-shit live.

677
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,350
Fascination with serial 
killersis an american pastime.

678
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:22,250
You've got groupie housewives,
magazine profiles,

679
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:25,750
maybe even a summerblockbuster movie...

680
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:28,130
all waiting for you.

681
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:32,860
But the feeding frenzy won't 
start till you throw out the chum.

682
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:36,820
Until then,I'm just gonna chill.

683
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,780
You're right.

684
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,750
Yeah.Is isn't the fun part.

685
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:54,800
The fun part... was 
hanging themlike cattle.

686
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:57,080
Hanging who?

687
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:03,580
The hookers... right before
I cut their throats.

688
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,490
Son of a bitch.

689
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:09,820
I used gravity rootsto hang them 
upside down to drain the blood.

690
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:10,650
Then...

691
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:13,100
That shit is privileged. 
The press nevergot ahold of that.

692
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:17,730
...I'd pour in liquid nitrogento freeze 
the blood before I cut them into nice,

693
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:21,660
- clean pieces.  
- Yes.

694
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:25,280
See,you got to understand --I-I hate blood.

695
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:28,070
And there it is --

696
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,770
all the expectations I had,

697
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:34,500
all the promises of 
greatness wiped out.

698
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:38,340
My circle of friends is down to one.

699
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:49,520
How -- what are youdoing 
here? Are you a cop?

700
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:52,410
The cameras are off.
I ve one minute.

701
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,520
Tell me why.I need to know.

702
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,730
- Why what?  
- Don't!

703
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:00,610
You killed again.

704
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:05,700
I told you£¨I warned you don't 
kill anyonewho doesn't deserve to die.

705
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,910
Why did you do it?

706
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:14,000
To feel something different.

707
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,470
Different than what?

708
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:21,900
What do you normally feel?

709
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:32,170
Nothing. Fucking nothing at all.

710
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,850
I hate every fucking 
god damn second of it.

711
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:39,010
I can't stand it --
living my life in my head.

712
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,470
Does killingmake it better?

713
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:02,730
No. Worse.

714
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:05,680
Fucking worse than ever.

715
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:10,990
Put your handson the table.

716
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,030
Do it.

717
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:20,140
I'm a lot like you,you know?

718
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:24,040
Yeah,right.You're a killer?

719
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:30,370
I'm empty...

720
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:38,270
but I found a way to make 
it feel less bottomless.

721
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,100
How?

722
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:45,480
Pretend.

723
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:48,640
You pretend the feeling 
sare there for the world

724
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:51,330
and for the peoplearound you.

725
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:56,410
Who knows? Maybe one 
day they will be.

726
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,540
What the hell are you doing,morgan?

727
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:59,630
I'm scraping under 
the nails for blood.

728
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,870
Get out.

729
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,660
I want 10 more minuteswith this 
piece of shit before his lawyer shows.

730
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,780
Stand up!

731
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:12,630
Living my life in my head --

732
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,200
I know exactly what jeremy means.

733
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:17,610
At least I had someone to talk to --

734
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,960
harry,my foster father.

735
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:23,540
He spent endless hours 
teaching me how to survive.

736
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,710
Excuse me,are you 
jeremy downs' lawyer?

737
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,560
Yes,I am. I'm just 
heading over to see him.

738
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:30,000
Sooner would be better.

739
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,550
- Seriously.  
- Thank you.

740
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:45,040
My mom died when I was 16 --cancer --

741
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:48,770
and then it was just 
me,my brother,my dad.

742
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:52,130
- You have a brother?  
- Yeah. Dexter.

743
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,030
He and my dadwere really tight.

744
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,740
They were always 
spending time together.

745
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,970
I guess I was jealous.

746
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:01,610
What,you mean you weren't 
daddy's little girl?

747
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:04,210
No,I was,kind of.

748
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:07,290
He just took a special 
interest in dex,you know?

749
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:10,300
I think that's whyI became 
a cop. That's what he was.

750
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,470
I thought maybe he would give 
me more attention or something.

751
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,930
And did he?

752
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:17,540
Not really...

753
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,990
but we had our moments.

754
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,490
What about you?  
How'd you become...

755
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,170
captain hook?

756
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,440
Well,when I was little,
my mom got in a car accident,

757
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:34,330
and she lost both her legs.

758
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,820
That's terrible.

759
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,570
I rememberwhen it happened,

760
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:42,200
I just wanted to 
put herback together...

761
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:45,230
you know,like humpty-dumpty,

762
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:49,260
just the pieces weren't around.

763
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,930
I'm going to miss my playmate.

764
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:22,760
Sure,there's rita and the kids,

765
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:25,730
but they don't know the real me.

766
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,750
They can never know the real me.

767
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:33,170
And now the father is back.

768
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,390
Things have changed.

769
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,140
Everything has changed.

770
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:48,870
I always prided myself on 
being an outsider, but now...

771
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:55,730
I feel the need to connect with someone.

772
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,730
I saw myself in jeremy...

773
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:05,450
but instead of helping 
him like harry helped me,

774
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:09,900
I gave him a piece of fortune-cookie 
advice that he never even heard.

775
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,990
I failed him.

776
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:15,480
He deserves better...

777
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,760
and he'll get it from now on.

778
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,270
I guess I was wrong.

779
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:48,440
Jeremy did hear my advice.

780
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,700
He killed someone who deserves to die.

781
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:55,840
What's the statuson perry?

782
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,460
I'm having him transferredright now.

783
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:00,800
The D.A. Wants to keep himat 
county, pending arraignment.

784
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:08,450
Maria,it wasyour decision making 
that led to his captureand arrest,

785
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:13,000
and you madeall our lives easier 
by getting the bastardto confess.

786
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:14,960
I'm just doing my job.

787
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:20,620
It feels good to bepraising your police 
work instead of your politicsfor a change.

788
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:23,940
We need to makean official comment.

789
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:26,680
Don't worry.I'll keep it short.

790
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:28,620
I'm just heading downstairs 
now for the press conference.

791
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:31,130
The press conferenceis over.

792
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,380
Oh,and,uh,don't worry.

793
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:36,290
I kept it short.

794
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,050
You got to be fucking kidding me.

795
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:39,770
That was my bust.

796
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:42,150
This is my department.

797
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:47,180
Did you at leastgive me credit?

798
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:49,500
Yes.I just gave it to you.

799
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:51,510
Haven't you been listening?

800
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:02,600
Ever since harry's 
death,I've been alone...

801
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,960
but now,for the first time...

802
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,830
I feel alone.

803
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,270
How long you need 
with the prisoner?

804
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,860
As long as I can get.

805
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:22,430
Jeremy is gone,

806
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:27,350
and neil perry will soon vanish 
into the catacombs of the system.

807
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,960
I have so many questions for him.

808
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:33,730
How did he discover my secrets?

809
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:36,660
What was his message to me?

810
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:40,470
He's been in my home,

811
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,280
my photos...my life.

812
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:48,320
He knows me.

813
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:51,250
Now I need to know him...

814
00:50:56,740 --> 00:51:00,430
to connect face-to-face

815
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:04,340
before he's beyond my reach forever.

816
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,060
Hi.

817
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:23,090
Who the fuck are you?
