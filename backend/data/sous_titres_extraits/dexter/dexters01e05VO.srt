00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,240
previously on "dexter"...

4
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,070
think this is our guy's work?

5
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,520
The ice-truck killer?

6
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,460
Laguerta insulted the real killer's intelligence,

7
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,150
and now he's getting back at us for 
chasing after the wrong guy.

8
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,050
It's the guard -- tucci.

9
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,690
I think he's alive.

10
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,070
Tucci's alive?

11
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,350
The ice-truck killer is keeping him 
alive to perform amputations.

12
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,360
He's sending me a message.

13
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,630
He wants me to go there.

14
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,350
Please.

15
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,490
He was left here so I would kill him.

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,560
Just kill me.

17
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,970
I can't kill this man.

18
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,040
I'm taking tucci over to county alive.

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,000
I don't know who your contacts are, morgan,

20
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,640
but you are my up-and-comer.

21
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,150
You saved a man's life tonight.

22
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,840
The thing that surprises me most about rita is

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,940
how much I like being with her.

24
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:33,380
There's all sorts of things I can do.

25
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,620
what are you doing?

26
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,300
Whatever I want.

27
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,100
My new friend thought I wouldn't be able to resist

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,400
the kill he left for me,but I did.

29
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,940
I'm not the monster he wants me to be.

30
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,300
I'm dexter.

31
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:15,780
I like to pretend I'm alone,completely alone

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,150
maybe post-apocalypse or plague

33
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,670
whatever no one left to act normal for

34
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,030
no need to hide who I really am.

35
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,690
It would be freeing.

36
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,560
Stop grinning like a fucking psycho and get back to work.

37
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,150
Sorry, sergeant.

38
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,570
I was just waiting for forensics to wrap up

39
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,540
before I tear the bed apart.

40
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,630
I'm not the only one who enjoys isolation.

41
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,800
My shadow companion chose this place well.

42
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:00,270
This was his sanctuary,for a while, at least.

43
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,160
All these people pawing over it seems...

44
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,810
disrespectful.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,700
Tell me the sick bastard bled on something, dexter.

46
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,640
He was here for days,playing with sharp objects.

47
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,320
I'll keep looking, but so far this place is spotless

48
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,170
amazingly so.The only blood I 
found belongs to the security guard.

49
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,590
Has he said anything yet?

50
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,250
Mr. Tucci's still unconscious.

51
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,340
Lieutenant, up here!

52
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,360
There's got to be something here. Find it.

53
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,410
The guy's not a ghost.

54
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,550
Tony tucci is evidence of that.

55
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,350
Hey, dexter, you get all this blood on camera yet?

56
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,550
It's like shooting a jackson pollock.

57
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,280
Well, your jackson pollock is in the bag.

58
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:50,880
Ready?

59
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,480
Okay.

60
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,110
Whoa. What was that?

61
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,220
Did you see that?

62
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,360
What?

63
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,820
Damn rats.

64
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,080
We're all gonna get histoplasmosis 
from all their shit in the dust.

65
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,290
We'll be coughing up blood,skin lesions, mouth sores.

66
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,400
Lovely.

67
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,970
Can we get the lights, guys?

68
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,290
You ever heard of rat-bite fever?

69
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,370
Masuka

70
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,550
what'd I say about the fucking rats?

71
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,140
You haven't found anything,won't find anything.

72
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,600
This is a bust, right?

73
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,110
In so many words.

74
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,620
Which means I'm just jerking off till tucci wakes up.

75
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,580
So take a break.You've been working this thing 24-7.

76
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,130
Or are you still avoiding a personal life?

77
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,120
Oh, fuck you.

78
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,900
And, yeah, I'm better off just focusing on the job.

79
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,150
Thanks, guys.

80
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,450
It doesn't have to be either/or.

81
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,010
Maybe not for you.

82
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,340
If I found someone,so can you, right?

83
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,950
Yeah, the trouble is keeping them.

84
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,160
Tell me about it.

85
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,670
Yelina?

86
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,930
Are you okay?

87
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,080
I'm sorry. I'm fine.

88
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,900
Ernesto hasn't arrived?

89
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,820
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

90
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,120
No.

91
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,510
The coyote wanted more money,and I didn't have it.

92
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,780
Coyote?

93
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,860
You mean the man you paid to bring him here?

94
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,630
He said he sent ernesto back to cuba.

95
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,520
But that was a week ago,

96
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,850
and no one in c*rdenas has heard from ernesto.

97
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,160
Yelina, how did you contact this coyote?

98
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,110
...this was his number,but it's not working anymore.

99
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,890
I was supposed to leave him money in a park.

100
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,330
Listen, my boyfriend works for the police.

101
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,730
I'm sure he --no, no, no.

102
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,300
We can't go to the police.

103
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,660
He said he'd hurt my family in cuba if we go to the police.

104
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,070
No, it's okay.

105
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,300
It's okay.

106
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,630
Dexter will know what to do.

107
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,150
I feel just terrible for her.

108
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,170
And they were supposed to be married after he got here.

109
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,410
I do know someone in the department

110
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,700
who deals with immigration issues.

111
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,690
I can talk to him.

112
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,670
That's really kind of you, dex.

113
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,860
I mean, can you imagine not knowing 
if your fiance is dead or alive?

114
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,860
Uh, no.

115
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,670
Every night after work yelina goes 
across the street,to the beach.

116
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:11,130
I've seen her there,just staring out at the water,

117
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,390
willing him to walk out of it.

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,510
Have you ever longed for anything like that?

119
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,150
She wants something from me.

120
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,400
Ever since the blow job,

121
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,010
she assumes we've taken it to the next level.

122
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:31,080
She doesn't know yet,I don't have a next level.

123
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:35,000
Well, when I was a kid,I would have killed for an atari.

124
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,040
You know?

125
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,700
Cody would laugh at the graphics now, but back then, man...

126
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,920
It always comes to this once sex is introduced.

127
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,620
Small talk no longer cuts it.

128
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,890
Eventually she'll call me a science project

129
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,330
and slam the door in my face.

130
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,770
But when do you think he'll wake up?

131
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,720
Yeah, I did call an hour ago,but there's a killer out there 

132
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,520
that's into whores and security guards,

133
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,330
but I'll bet nurses are next.

134
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,140
Yo, check you,all "mpd blue."

135
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,150
Shanda,what are you doing here?

136
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,270
You have another lead on the ice-truck killer?

137
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,370
Man, I got bigger worries than that sick shit.

138
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,730
Now, I got me a girl on the inside, right?

139
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,560
I'm not springing your pimp,if that's what you're after.

140
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,630
Oh, hell, no.

141
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,360
But my landlord's another fucking story --

142
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,330
trying to kick me out of my home.

143
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,440
He got no cause,except he's a born-again 
hypocrite mother fucker.

144
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,860
Yeah, and you want me to talk to him?

145
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,240
No, I want you to beat in his pasty, white face.

146
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,690
Morgan.

147
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,090
Found this in evidence.

148
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,870
Masuka was gonna grease it through.

149
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,350
A cigarette butt?

150
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,240
Jesus, we could pull dna off of that, or even a print.

151
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,640
Except it would be your print.

152
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,290
You were smoking on a crime scene.

153
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:54,340
Not on the crime scene --like on the way-far end of the park.

154
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,550
The whole area's a crime scene.

155
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,600
You should know that by now.

156
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,940
Maybe you ought to just calm the hell down, my brother.

157
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,970
Who the fuck is that?

158
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,500
Give it a rest, shanda.

159
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,880
Morgan,go do something useful.

160
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,340
Go sit on that security guard until he wakes up.

161
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,770
And do not talk to him without me.

162
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,480
Believe me --your maid is not the first one to get screwed.

163
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,890
No, she's a maid.

164
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:19,920
She's not my maid.

165
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,570
So, have you heard of any other 
cuban immigrants disappearing?

166
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,540
A few.The poor bastards.

167
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,450
They spend their life savings,

168
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,950
get stuffed into a fishhold,puke the whole 90 miles to miami.

169
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,190
Then they get here, thinking,"I'm an american. I'm free."

170
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,920
Except the damn coyote...

171
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,460
he won't let them go till his family comes up

172
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,560
with a surprise release fee.

173
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,890
If they can't pay...they disappear.

174
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,730
Freedom's just another word for one more way to get fucked.

175
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,830
Sounds like someone's doing something very bad.

176
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,240
You have any suspects?

177
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,050
Sure, four or five, mostly cubans themselves,

178
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,120
but not enough evidence for a conviction or even a warrant.

179
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,310
If warrants were applied for,

180
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,240
their names will be in the database.

181
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,760
Look, buddy...

182
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,030
I know you want to help out your maid,

183
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:26,000
but there ain't a hell of a lot you can do.

184
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,850
You'd be surprised.

185
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,970
Jorge castillo --

186
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,960
number 3 on the department's list of suspects

187
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,710
but the only one even remotely close to the park

188
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,280
where yelina was supposed to drop the money.

189
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,520
They never got enough evidence for a search warrant

190
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,900
but I don't need permission to keep an eye on this guy.

191
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:29,270
No neighbors,no foot traffic --it's promising.

192
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:36,360
A good place for human trafficking...or worse.

193
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,680
Excuse me.

194
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,170
Private yard.

195
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:49,710
I'm just praying you have a '69 stingray 
headlight somewhere in here.

196
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,260
Uh, dave cutler.

197
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,200
Jorge castillo.

198
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,220
I'm sorry, but I don'T.

199
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,110
Man, my restoration's almost done.

200
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,230
She's a beauty.

201
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,770
I don't do individual sales,mr. Cutler,

202
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,400
but I can give you the name of a corvette shop I deal with.

203
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,560
I'll be happy to look around myself.

204
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,970
No offense, man,but I can't take my phone orders

205
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,060
if I'm watching over my merchandise.

206
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,760
You run this whole place alone?

207
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,450
Yeah, it keeps my costs down.

208
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,890
Hey, I'm sorry you made the trip out here.

209
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,230
You know what?

210
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,100
Try wexler's,out in tamarac.

211
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,580
That's my vette guy.

212
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,290
Yeah.

213
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,020
Must be nice being your own boss --

214
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,790
get out in the water whenever you want.

215
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,760
I saw that floater on your key chain.

216
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,940
I got to get one of those.

217
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,630
Lost my keys overboard twice in the past year.

218
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,750
I do a little fishing.I got a 32-foot concept.

219
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,030
What about you?

220
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,090
I got a rowboat with a hole in it.

221
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,300
A lo major los pescados te encuentran.

222
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,190
I don't speak spanish, sir.

223
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,240
Sorry.I just assumed you were cuban.

224
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:00,010
American, pal,just like you.

225
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,920
Just like me.

226
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,860
He's on heavy sedatives at the moment.

227
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,700
I think he deserves them.

228
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,500
I'll wait.

229
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,460
Hey.

230
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,990
Mr. Tucci.

231
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,800
Tony.

232
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,400
I'm gonna find this cocksucker.

233
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,200
I swear.

234
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,630
I don't understand america's obsession with cars.

235
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,680
I can just imagine squeezing rita and the kids

236
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,960
into that thing and hitting the open road --

237
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,130
cramped quarters,public bathrooms,

238
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,570
hours of nothing but conversation.

239
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:38,760
It's someone's american dream -- my nightmare.

240
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,880
This must be where castillo locks them up.

241
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,780
But if he's killing them when they can't pay

242
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,000
he's not doing it here.

243
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,540
So where are they?

244
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,400
Dexter morgan.

245
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,550
Gerard here.

246
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,700
There's a floater down in south beach morgue.

247
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,020
Could be a match for your maid's fianc?

248
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,510
She's a maid.

249
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,850
She's not my --is it all right if I bring her down?

250
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,530
The sooner, the better.

251
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,000
Okay, then. Thanks.Have a good day.

252
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,670
Tonight at the salsa room.

253
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,100
You got to help me celebrate my pay-grade bump.

254
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,890
Actually, I have a personal project I'm working on tonight.

255
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,300
Blow it off.I'm buying.

256
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,010
Angel, do you have that list of prioritized witnesses?

257
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,480
I can't deal with 800 anonymous tips.

258
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,700
I'm working on it.

259
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:18,800
Well, how about you stop talking and earn your bump?

260
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,820
Sexy.

261
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,810
Don't leave me hanging tonight, bro.

262
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,670
It's you and me. 

263
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,900
I wonder what I did to make him think we're so close.

264
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,900
I wonder if it'd work on rita.

265
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,660
Dexter morgan --I called earlier.

266
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,700
Oh, right, yeah, about the floater.

267
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,030
Yeah.

268
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:47,400
Hey, jerry, can you take these guys around back?

269
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,830
Should I?

270
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,560
Nah,I'll go with her.

271
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,400
She might need a shoulder.

272
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,100
She senses I'm not a shoulder.

273
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,620
Bad sign -- she's catching on.

274
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,990
I don't know what kind of idiot thinks an inner tube

275
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,330
is gonna get him over 90 miles of open ocean.

276
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:12,760
If you ask me, man,it's darwin's theory at work.

277
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,100
That must be what love looks like.

278
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,150
The inability to feel has its advantages...

279
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,930
...sometimes.

280
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,680
Hey, dexter.

281
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,820
Hey, mindy.

282
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,370
Do you need any help?

283
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,480
No.

284
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,350
So, are you gonna go to the spring formal?

285
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,830
Why would I want to do that?

286
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,100
She wanted you to ask her to the dance, dexter.

287
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,890
That's not what she said.

288
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,300
Well, you have to learn their signals.

289
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,070
Yeah, well, I don't really care about girls.

290
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,240
Oh.

291
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,460
I just like being alone.

292
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,540
But most normal people don't

293
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,780
and it's important that you seem normal.

294
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,270
Even though I'm not.

295
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,450
Because you're not.

296
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,450
We'll start you off with a temporary prefab

297
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,770
and then make adjustments as we go.

298
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:51,480
Rudy here's gonna put back together again,good as new.

299
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,240
Half the battle is attitude,

300
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,920
and you have a great one.

301
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,230
Well, I'm alive.

302
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,670
I didn't see that happening,but here I am.

303
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:11,040
Yo, pretty boy,you're stealing my thunder,

304
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:14,110
and I got a hottie waiting on me, so...

305
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,980
I don't know.

306
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,600
I just might have to fight you for this one.

307
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,460
Okay,we'll arm-wrestle later.

308
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,300
Now get out of here.

309
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,010
Watch out for this guy.

310
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,540
He's a dog.

311
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,870
Excuse me.

312
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,540
I know what you need, guys,but I didn't see much.

313
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,050
Well, any detail will help,mr. Tucci.

314
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:49,030
Well...he came up on me from behind,

315
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:52,880
and he wore a mask when he made me put the...

316
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,330
the...things on the ice.

317
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,560
I'll get it.

318
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,670
Angel of mercy.

319
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,100
Just how merciful are you?

320
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,890
Oh, you are a dog,aren't you?

321
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,590
So the ladies tell me.

322
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:13,840
Can you tell us how tall he was or 
if he was black,white, latino?

323
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,250
White, I think.

324
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:19,750
I'm guessing maybe average height --

325
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:24,090
not fat, not thin,just average.

326
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,600
I don't know.

327
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,980
And when he started, you know,working on me,

328
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,670
I was blindfolded, so...

329
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,540
did u hear anything?

330
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,070
Did he have an accent or anything?

331
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,750
He didn't talk much,or he'd whisper.

332
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,430
And that's all you heard?

333
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,890
Except the rats.

334
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,690
Sometimes they would crawl up on the bed,

335
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,590
and I'd have to shake them off.

336
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,320
Some crap-ass witness I am, huh?

337
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,590
You're doing fine.

338
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,840
You've given us a lot.

339
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,730
Yeah?

340
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,010
Yeah.

341
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:08,330
You know, sometimes when I'm trying to remember something

342
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,260
I close my eyes.

343
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,190
Really?

344
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:15,570
We could even blindfold you again.

345
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,520
...I'm kind of tired right now.

346
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,950
It's okay.Get some rest.

347
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,750
Officer morgan and i are leaving.

348
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,760
Alone.

349
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,340
No pretending.

350
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,000
No hiding.

351
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,250
No time to relax.

352
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,890
I'm too close.

353
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,750
Jorge castillo is bad.

354
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,080
That I know.

355
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,110
But bad enough to have killed yelina's fianc?

356
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,360
That I have to prove.

357
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,350
Jorge's not-so-humble abode.

358
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,100
Yeesh -- new money.

359
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:27,540
Normal people dream of this --a new car, a big home, 

360
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,950
a boat at the reef shore marina...

361
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,300
...and a beautiful wife.

362
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:37,150
Too bad -- I never enjoy making someone a widow.

363
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,920
They're so happy.

364
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,180
She has no clue who she's with.

365
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,350
Maybe that's the secret to a successful relationship.

366
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,860
Mr. Perry,you were on the grounds

367
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,340
of the same hospital where we found mr. Tucci.

368
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,330
And you were alone that night?

369
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,290
Uh, it was just me and caesar, my dog.

370
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,290
He likes abandoned buildings.Caesar's a ratter.

371
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,080
What did this guy do?

372
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,470
Why?Does he look familiar?

373
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:11,490
Yes, he looks like an actor from that john singleton movie.

374
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,630
What was that?

375
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,230
How about you focus on whether or not he was thman

376
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,810
you saw at the old hospital that night, mr. Perry?

377
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,940
Well, it was difficult to tell.

378
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,210
It was dark.

379
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,150
You said you got a look at him.

380
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,070
He had a cap.

381
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:35,260
Hey, is that kg-230 hooked into a digital cctb network?

382
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,090
Ooh, you better have a hell of a firewall.

383
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,670
You get better resolution with the 440.

384
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,930
Hello.

385
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,450
We're done here.

386
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,200
Give me a minute.

387
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,380
Morgan, thank mr. Perry for his horseshit and send him home.

388
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,950
Christ on a crutch,he could tell us something.

389
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,990
Sergeant doakes says he is a looky-loo.

390
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,310
We get dozens like that every time a story hits the news.

391
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,800
Now do me a favor --get him out of my precinct.Thank you.

392
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,040
You could try being a little more optimistic.

393
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,990
I mean, if tony tucci can be optimistic,I think we can.

394
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,190
You might get more out of people.

395
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,130
How do you know perry doesn't know anything?

396
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:29,560
Because I've been doing this a lot longer than you.

397
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,660
Okay.

398
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,970
This case is getting colder every minute 
you waste on bullshit like perry. 

399
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,860
And wanting to blindfold a trauma victim?

400
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,060
What the fuck were you thinking?

401
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:44,600
Tucci's closed for business now,and you shut him down.

402
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:49,330
I...I was trying a new approach.

403
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,290
Maybe you should just learn the basics 

404
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:57,100
before you reinvent the damn wheel.

405
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,800
come on.How can you not dance to this?

406
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:21,940
It's a gift.

407
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,220
We just need some more patrón, compadre.

408
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:25,700
Another round!

409
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,720
No more for me.

410
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,890
I got to get up early --killers to catch.

411
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:29,840
Forget that.

412
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,820
The night's just beginning,right, ladies?

413
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,810
Yes!

414
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,220
Ladies, excuse us.Angel, come here.

415
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:39,100
Your wife --she's probably worrying.

416
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,430
I don't know what she'd think of your new friend.

417
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,770
She don't mind who I flirt with as long 
as I bring home la pasion.

418
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,030
La pasion?

419
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,290
Yeah, it keeps the relationship alive.

420
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,380
Hey, what about, uh, communication, trust?

421
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,420
La pasion.

422
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,130
Wait.

423
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,190
What if she wants something more?

424
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,890
Then you reciprocate --you know...

425
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,750
no, I meant what if she wants something more emotionally?

426
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,790
Don't go down that emotional road.

427
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,270
Just go down on her.

428
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,560
It's easier,and she'll be distracted.

429
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,500
Come on.Let's dance, angel.

430
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,470
So...

431
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,500
what do you want to do now?

432
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,440
Dance with her, dexter.

433
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,740
Be polite.

434
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,020
Get her punch.

435
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,730
Open the door for her.

436
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,920
And if you find yourself alone with her

437
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,000
and things get romantic --

438
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,620
dad, I've kissed a girl before.

439
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,060
You have?

440
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:39,690
Yeah.

441
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,950
And?

442
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,240
I don't know.

443
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,510
It was okay.

444
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,350
Dexter, women are different from men.

445
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,690
We've had this talk, dad.

446
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,030
I'm saying they have a whole different experience of things.

447
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:54,960
When they're with someone,physically,they feel connected.

448
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,770
And they know when you're not.

449
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,200
They can sense it because you're very exposed.

450
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,300
Yeah, you're naked.

451
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,720
I mean emotionally.

452
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,630
Son, this is going to be very dangerous for you.

453
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,250
I can fake it.

454
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:10,870
Buddy, you can learn to fake a lot of things.

455
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,370
This is a tough one.

456
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,900
Is this it?

457
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:40,630
Angel, I've only been here one time.I don't remember.

458
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,440
Wake up.

459
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,520
Your wife's gonna love me.

460
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:02,200
The problem with acting normal is normal people 
get into stupid situations like this.

461
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:06,390
Oh. You scared the hell out of me.

462
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,510
Sorry, nina.

463
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,090
I'm dexter.

464
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:11,290
You remember?I work with angel down at the station.

465
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,830
What are you doing here?

466
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,340
It's funny.

467
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,010
We were out celebrating angel's pay-grade bump.

468
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,280
He got a raise?

469
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:21,370
Yeah.

470
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:27,620
Well, as you can see,he, uh, had a little too much to drink,

471
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,940
so I gave him a ride home.

472
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,690
He doesn't live here anymore.

473
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,940
Oh.

474
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,680
We're separated.

475
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,210
Oh.

476
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:45,690
So...good night.

477
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,860
Oh, okay.

478
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,720
Good night.

479
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,930
Come on.

480
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,090
La pasion.

481
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,820
Angel.

482
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:05,700
Angel, we're really late for work, amigo.

483
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,210
I guess I had one too many, huh?

484
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,950
And then about 10 more.

485
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,390
How did I end up here?

486
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,080
You don't remember?

487
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,980
So you live here, huh?

488
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,400
I live here.

489
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,940
You're kind of neat,aren't you?

490
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,200
Bad habit instilled by mom.

491
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,500
Hey.

492
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,870
We better get going.

493
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:10,650
Pressure's on with this ice-truck-killer situation.

494
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,980
Yeah. You go ahead.

495
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:12,780
I'll lock up.

496
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,820
I have to stop by home anyway.

497
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:17,050
My wife's gonna be worried.

498
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,330
She gets so hot and bothered.

499
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,440
No, I'll just wait,and I'll drop you at your car.

500
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,300
Where's your bathroom? 

501
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,700
Somehow it's reassuring to know I'm not 

502
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,820
the only one pretending to be normal.

503
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:38,580
I found hair on this one that doesn't 
belong to tucci --rat hair.

504
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,680
I probably picked up a parasite just --

505
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,050
don't test me, masuka.

506
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,630
Uh, you see all that shredding?

507
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,970
Half of this sheet must be lining their nests.

508
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,500
They took evidence away from the crime scene?

509
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:49,290
Exactly.

510
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:51,000
So we check their nest.

511
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,670
Uh...wild goose chase,without knowing 
what we're looking for.

512
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,370
We could talk to tucci again.

513
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,290
He knows more than he thinks,

514
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,620
and my gut tells me he can take it.

515
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:04,240
'Cause you got the instincts of a veteran on the force.

516
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,050
Masuka, run the sheet.

517
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,000
See if we can trace it to manufacturer.

518
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:10,190
I've got court in the morning,so call me on my cell --

519
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,510
all right, I get it.I'm a newbie.

520
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,240
But you are old and tired,and you need new eyes on this.

521
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,330
So when you're ready to let me do my job, you let me know.

522
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,450
And don't you fucking say a word, masuka.

523
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,800
How do you get rid of the ones who don't pay out?

524
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:30,230
Do you drop them in the middle of the ocean,

525
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,050
tell them to swim for shore?

526
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,330
You can't hide for long, jorge.

527
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,620
Hello?

528
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:40,160
Dexter, it's me.

529
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:44,190
Look, I'm sorry I haven't talked to you since that place.

530
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,530
The morgue.

531
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,750
Do you think they'll be able to catch whoever did this?

532
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,710
I'm sure he'll get what he deserves.

533
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,050
How are you doing?

534
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,260
Still a little shaky.

535
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,140
I have some late-night work I have to do,

536
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:01,630
but I could stop by earlier,if you want.

537
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,710
Maybe we could rent a movie.

538
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:07,500
Yeah, I'll pick up a dvd --something light.

539
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:26,380
Maybe if I don't blink,my eyes will tear up.

540
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,740
I hate this.

541
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:33,830
I'm questioning every move.It's exhausting.

542
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,440
I should just break it off already,

543
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:45,700
unless I can pacify her,give her...something,reciprocate.

544
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,400
La pasion.

545
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,800
Whoa, uh, dexter?

546
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,580
I'm sorry.

547
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,330
I-I, uh...

548
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:00,900
oh, I was just...

549
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:04,060
you were so generous with me.

550
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,740
I was gonna return the favor.

551
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:12,750
Oh, no, that's very sweet,but I'm sorry.

552
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:16,300
I'm just not in the mood for that.

553
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,800
That you, dex?

554
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,650
Yeah.Sorry I'm late.

555
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,280
It's okay, son.

556
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:35,030
You must have been having fun.

557
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,400
I pretended to.

558
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,850
That's good, dexter.

559
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:38,890
Dad?

560
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,590
Do you think that maybe one day I'll feel it for real?

561
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:49,390
I hope so, son.

562
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,690
I really do.

563
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:02,470
Alone, I'd be better off.

564
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:05,380
Relationships are too confusing.

565
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,850
But this I can figure out.

566
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,720
This I do well.

567
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,430
Jorge castillo's boat.

568
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,840
If he's a killer,then there's proof.

569
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,150
There's always proof,and I'll find it.

570
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:40,200
Happy, in love...the perfect couple.

571
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:44,200
I wonder if rita and the kids would like fishing.

572
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,800
Focus.

573
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:02,470
If one of these matches the contact number for ernesto's coyote,

574
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,700
you're it, jorge.

575
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,200
He drowns them here,then dumps them out there.

576
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,510
If they wash up,it'll be chalked up 
to another inner-tube mishap.

577
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:59,160
Yep -- this I do well.

578
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,990
Think about his shoes.

579
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,300
Did he walk with a limp?

580
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:10,990
Did he move smoothly,like an athlete?

581
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,280
Try to remember, tony,for me.

582
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,430
I would if I could, hon.

583
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:24,170
You're a sweet lady,and smart
using your charms on me.

584
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,340
No, no, I don't mind.

585
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,310
It's probably the last time a woman 
will flirt with me,looking like this.

586
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,330
It's okay, tony.

587
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,840
Maybe later.

588
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:38,060
We should try the blindfold.

589
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,770
What?

590
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,270
I don't want to do that.

591
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:43,600
I'm sorry, mr. Tucci.

592
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,790
I can't even begin to imagine what you've been through

593
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:49,180
but it's our job to make sure 
that nobody else goes through it, too.

594
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,500
So, morgan, you're up.

595
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,120
He was hard to hear.

596
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,370
I never knew where he was.

597
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,820
So he's agile.That's good, tony.

598
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,360
What else did you hear?

599
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,600
Rats.

600
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,170
Always those damn rats.

601
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,060
Try to focus on him, tony.

602
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,090
What did you hear?

603
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,110
What did you smell?

604
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,480
Menthol.

605
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,930
Menthol?

606
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,090
Yeah, like cough drops.

607
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,240
He cleared his throat a lot.

608
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:46,300
You know, like --

609
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,680
He unwrapped them.

610
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:56,220
I could hear those wrappers,that crinkly sound.

611
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,720
And he sucked on them.

612
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:07,360
I could hear them clicking against his teeth when he...

613
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,490
The son of a bitch loved those fucking lozenges.

614
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,970
Nothing in this nest.

615
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:33,250
Well, check another floor.They're all over this dump.

616
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,700
Fuck this.

617
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,320
Masuka.

618
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,080
We got another one over here.

619
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,300
Promising.Several fragments from the sheet here.

620
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:52,680
These rat bastards were repeat customers.

621
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,410
Who had garlic for lunch?

622
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:58,970
I'm gonna punch you in the neck.

623
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:04,700
Actually...I think you're gonna french me.

624
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,900
...2934.

625
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,800
I like being right.

626
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:23,500
I usually am,about these things.

627
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,320
"Be prepared" -- my motto.

628
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,620
The boy scouts and i have that in common.

629
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:36,730
Of course, there's no merit badge for tonight's outing.

630
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:59,480
What are we looking at?

631
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:04,040
They found the ice-truck killer's 
lozenge wrapper,thanks to your sister.

632
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,550
Lozenge wrapper?

633
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,300
Hey, after two months of finding fuck all in this case,

634
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:11,640
a lozenge wrapper's the damn holy grail.

635
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,550
My favorite serial killer is a lozenge eater.

636
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,100
How human of him. 

637
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:22,550
We have a partial.

638
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:24,970
Partial print --a partial fucking print!

639
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,680
Proud of you, sis.

640
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,280
Hey, it's a celebration here.

641
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,300
Where are you going?

642
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,140
Crime scene.

643
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,550
Excuse me.

644
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:37,120
What's, uh --what's going on?

645
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,890
We've got our first piece of tangible 
evidence on the ice-truck killer.

646
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,560
A partial fucking print.

647
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,830
You run it through afis yet?

648
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,570
It doesn't even matter if we get a match.

649
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,470
He gets pulled in for something,anything, we got him.

650
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:49,490
We get it photoed before we scan it.

651
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:58,190
...And let's keep working the old hospital site, people.

652
00:42:58,270 --> 00:42:59,920
You never know.We might get lucky again.

653
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,860
It wasn't luck.

654
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:03,610
Good work, morgan.

655
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,810
Afuera, va.

656
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:22,340
Muevanse. Come on.

657
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,710
Come on!

658
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,100
Entrar, entrar.

659
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:59,500
God bless america.

660
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,790
Hon?

661
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,580
Where are you?

662
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,310
Honey?

663
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:30,200
Honey, you in here?

664
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,500
Iderrito a mi familia!

665
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,400
Get back in there,you cuban piece of shit!

666
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,600
Fucking animals.

667
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:54,650
Incredible.

668
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:57,150
They're an even better match than I thought --

669
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:59,720
true partnership.

670
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:11,170
You know,I rarely deviate from a plan,

671
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:15,420
but I just didn't have the heart to split up such A...

672
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:18,170
...Perfect couple.

673
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,790
You two...

674
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:29,250
have quite a lucrative operation going.

675
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,750
You're a really good team.

676
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:38,020
It's clever, too.

677
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:45,660
No one questions another drowned cuban man or woman...

678
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,550
or child.

679
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,100
So, which one of you thought this up?

680
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,640
They get freedom.

681
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:53,780
We free them.

682
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,930
They thank us,for god's sake.

683
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:00,080
For drowning them and dumping 
their bodies in the ocean?Please.

684
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:03,290
We can pay you.We have money.

685
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,410
That's what it's all about, right?

686
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:07,680
I love you.

687
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,880
I love you so much.

688
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,120
I love you so much.

689
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,000
I'm gonna ask you a question.

690
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:21,890
I want you to answer me honestly.

691
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:24,700
No more bullshit.Do you understand?

692
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,920
How long have you been married?

693
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,280
12 years.

694
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:33,230
How do you love each other?

695
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:39,950
You're like me,and you make it work.How?

696
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:41,440
We want the same life.

697
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,360
We both --

698
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,660
we want the same thing.

699
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:44,570
Same life.

700
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,750
You share the same dream.

701
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:49,200
Yes, exactly, yes.

702
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,140
Yes, that's it.

703
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:52,620
That's, uh...

704
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:56,480
...helpful.

705
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,770
Thank you.

706
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:00,000
No.

707
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:50,960
I like doing things properly,but I'm out of time,

708
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,250
and I still have to dispose of them.

709
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:58,200
Valerie got short shrift.

710
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:02,300
But all in all,it was a very good night.

711
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:58,130
I like this place.

712
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:01,600
A lot of memories are buried down there.

713
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:10,350
Deviating from the plan may have been ill-advised.

714
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:28,000
But sometimes you just have to take a risk.

715
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:42,390
After all...

716
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:48,750
...isn't that what relationships are all about?

717
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,150
Do you have a dream...

718
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:15,150
...for your life...

719
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:19,620
your future, I guess?

720
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,260
Of course.

721
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:22,940
Do you?

722
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:26,400
It might sound weird.

723
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:39,500
I want to someday be content and just feel...

724
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:44,620
comfortable,like everyone else.

725
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:47,850
I want...

726
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:50,100
a normal life.

727
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:57,740
Yeah, a normal life.

728
00:52:57,810 --> 00:53:00,610
That's all I want.

729
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,100
Just that.

730
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,810
No fame and fortune --

731
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,400
excitement at every turn?

732
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:11,890
No, I've had enough excitement.

733
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,490
Thank you.

734
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:14,910
Now...

735
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:16,850
I'll take boring.

736
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:19,090
Average.

737
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:21,650
Ordinary.

738
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:25,720
That's weird, huh?

739
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,550
Yeah.
