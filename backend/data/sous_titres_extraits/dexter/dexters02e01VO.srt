1
00:01:57,957 --> 00:02:00,896
<i>Blood.
Sometimes, it sets my teeth on edge.</i>

2
00:02:01,514 --> 00:02:03,903
<i>Other times,
it helps me control the chaos.</i>

3
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,103
<i>Last season on Dexter...</i>

4
00:02:08,681 --> 00:02:11,123
<i>Tonight's the night
and it's going to happen again,</i>

5
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,489
<i>and again.</i>

6
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:15,272
Open your eyes and look...
at what you did!

7
00:02:15,403 --> 00:02:17,372
Please, you have to understand.

8
00:02:17,477 --> 00:02:19,329
Trust me, I definitely understand.

9
00:02:19,486 --> 00:02:22,296
Children, I could never do that,
not like you.

10
00:02:22,453 --> 00:02:24,448
- Why?
- I have standards.

11
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,285
- You better be a cop.
- No, forensics.

12
00:02:29,343 --> 00:02:30,992
- They found another hooker.
- Another?

13
00:02:31,097 --> 00:02:32,462
That's the 3rd one in five months.

14
00:02:32,646 --> 00:02:34,319
There's no blood near the body at all.

15
00:02:34,451 --> 00:02:36,157
It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

16
00:02:36,262 --> 00:02:39,958
<i>I've never seen such
clean dry neat looking, dead flesh.</i>

17
00:02:40,142 --> 00:02:42,032
How does the killer
get rid of the blood?

18
00:02:42,216 --> 00:02:44,028
<i>I think this is a friendly message.</i>

19
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,918
<i>Kind of like:
"Hey, wanna play?"</i>

20
00:02:46,076 --> 00:02:47,757
<i>And yes, I wanna play.</i>

21
00:02:47,914 --> 00:02:49,056
<i>I really, really do.</i>

22
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:51,323
What's this sick son of a bitch
trying to tell us?

23
00:02:51,413 --> 00:02:52,925
<i>Not us, me.</i>

24
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:54,281
Interesting hand job.

25
00:02:54,386 --> 00:02:55,725
You think this is our guy's work?

26
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,195
The Ice Truck Killer.

27
00:02:57,353 --> 00:02:58,587
This feels familiar.

28
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:01,835
<i>When he broke into my apartment,
he took some time to get to know me.</i>

29
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:04,420
<i>My life, my secrets... he knows.</i>

30
00:03:04,683 --> 00:03:07,624
<i>He's not corrupting the happy
Hallmark images of my youth.</i>

31
00:03:07,768 --> 00:03:10,052
<i>He's revealing
the ugly truth behind them.</i>

32
00:03:10,367 --> 00:03:13,068
Son, there are people out there
who do really bad things.

33
00:03:13,128 --> 00:03:15,237
But of course, you have to learn
how to spot them,

34
00:03:15,316 --> 00:03:16,419
but I can teach you.

35
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:19,755
<i>The code of Harry,
my foster father, is satisfied.</i>

36
00:03:19,845 --> 00:03:22,017
So how the hell
was your date with Rita last night?

37
00:03:22,122 --> 00:03:23,146
Great.

38
00:03:23,225 --> 00:03:24,826
<i>She's perfect because Rita is,</i>

39
00:03:25,062 --> 00:03:27,084
<i>in her own way,
as damaged as me.</i>

40
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:29,500
- I want...
- a normal life.

41
00:03:30,314 --> 00:03:31,758
Yeah, a normal life.

42
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:35,960
The killer is an artist.

43
00:03:36,151 --> 00:03:38,042
You give me the fucking creeps,
you know that?

44
00:03:38,147 --> 00:03:39,880
Yeah, I know.
Sorry about that.

45
00:03:40,038 --> 00:03:41,981
<i>Why in a building full of cops,</i>

46
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:43,391
<i>is Doakes,</i>

47
00:03:43,694 --> 00:03:45,728
<i>the only one
who gets the creeps from me?</i>

48
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,639
I want you and Rita
to meet my boyfriend.

49
00:03:47,796 --> 00:03:49,017
Dex, Rudy's different.

50
00:03:49,174 --> 00:03:51,485
<i>I feel safe with him.
I think... I'm falling for him.</i>

51
00:03:55,218 --> 00:03:56,820
I waited a long time to meet you.

52
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,894
Dad's coming home?

53
00:03:59,288 --> 00:04:01,401
If their dad shows up,
we'll deal with it together.

54
00:04:01,506 --> 00:04:03,660
Paul Bennett, father on parole.

55
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,196
Are you fucking my wife?

56
00:04:06,587 --> 00:04:08,543
My heart beats for those two kids,

57
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,668
so if you or that skinny bitch
try to screw with what's mine,

58
00:04:11,773 --> 00:04:13,873
I swear to God,
I don't care who I have to hurt...

59
00:04:14,031 --> 00:04:15,134
<i>Let's face it, Paul,</i>

60
00:04:15,344 --> 00:04:16,604
<i>you've been a problem.</i>

61
00:04:16,827 --> 00:04:18,258
<i>It's time for you to go away.</i>

62
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:19,589
He smacked me over the head,

63
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:22,131
<i>dragged me out of the house
probably through the backyard.</i>

64
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:24,697
<i>All I want is for you
to look for a shoe.</i>

65
00:04:24,828 --> 00:04:26,666
<i>It's missing, I'm telling you.</i>

66
00:04:26,797 --> 00:04:28,635
Dexter is not who you think he is.

67
00:04:28,898 --> 00:04:31,038
Do I have the pleasure
of your company this weekend?

68
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,362
We've had a major break
in the Ice Truck Killer case.

69
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,897
Debra Morgan...

70
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,892
will you marry me?

71
00:04:36,997 --> 00:04:38,363
Yes, yes!

72
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:40,680
- Where's my sister?
- Took her code 12.

73
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:41,929
Left about an hour ago.

74
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,727
How did you not know who I was?

75
00:04:44,055 --> 00:04:46,585
I think a real cop would...

76
00:04:46,848 --> 00:04:50,104
at least have a sense that she was
in the presence of the person she was...

77
00:04:50,288 --> 00:04:51,705
hunting.

78
00:04:52,854 --> 00:04:54,737
Where the fuck are you?
I'm here at work,

79
00:04:54,843 --> 00:04:56,497
and you're not. I need to talk to you.

80
00:04:56,602 --> 00:04:58,438
<i>Do not see Rudy until you find me.</i>

81
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:01,334
You're connected to this. I don't know
how, but I'm gonna find out,

82
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:03,514
and some of what I find
is gonna stick to your ass.

83
00:05:03,619 --> 00:05:05,942
I was hoping you could dig up
an old case file for me.

84
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,150
Well, sure thing.

85
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:09,263
It's the crime scene
where Harry found me.

86
00:05:09,762 --> 00:05:11,942
<i>This is what he wanted me to find
all along.</i>

87
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:13,491
<i>He's showing me where to go.</i>

88
00:05:13,858 --> 00:05:16,432
Laura Moser and three others
found chopped up with a chain saw.

89
00:05:17,842 --> 00:05:20,239
What is in that report
that Harry didn't want me to see?

90
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,628
What he saw
in that cargo container changed him.

91
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:25,305
You were left there for days,
starving,

92
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,668
<i>in blood 2 inches thick.</i>

93
00:05:27,957 --> 00:05:29,270
You remember now?

94
00:05:31,278 --> 00:05:32,355
<i>I have a brother.</i>

95
00:05:32,486 --> 00:05:33,589
A real brother.

96
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,308
I didn't even know you existed.

97
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:37,802
Imagine how I felt

98
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:41,372
when I tracked you down
and found out you were exactly like me.

99
00:05:41,556 --> 00:05:44,050
You can't be a killer and a hero.

100
00:05:44,654 --> 00:05:46,519
It doesn't work that way!

101
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:54,088
Why me, Dex?
Why'd he choose me?

102
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:55,900
You're just lucky, I guess.

103
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,627
I was so scared.

104
00:06:02,249 --> 00:06:03,929
What am I,
one of your victims now?

105
00:06:04,218 --> 00:06:05,505
No, you're not a trophy...

106
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:08,026
but you need to be put down.

107
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:11,138
Sorry.

108
00:06:11,321 --> 00:06:13,566
<i>I drove away a brother who accepts me,</i>

109
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:15,588
<i>for a foster father who betrayed me.</i>

110
00:06:15,824 --> 00:06:18,266
<i>I'm not alone and Harry kept it from me.</i>

111
00:06:18,633 --> 00:06:20,931
<i>Doakes always sensed
I was hiding something.</i>

112
00:06:21,062 --> 00:06:22,086
<i>Now, he knows.</i>

113
00:06:22,217 --> 00:06:26,096

117
00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:57,599

121

<i>Although a spare will do.</i>

123
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:29,728
Nice.
Nice warmer ball.

124
00:07:29,859 --> 00:07:31,487
Now, you can get that.
Remember.

125
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:32,771
Loose arm swing.

126
00:07:32,903 --> 00:07:34,189
Loose.
Got it.

127
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:35,791
Yeah, and keep your mind limber.

128
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:37,564
I'm doing mental Jumping Jacks.

00:07:40,748 --> 00:07:41,929
<i>I'm on edge.</i>

131
00:07:42,586 --> 00:07:44,686
<i>Thirty eight days, sixteen hours, and...</i>

132
00:07:44,818 --> 00:07:47,548
<i>twelve minutes have passed

133
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,408
<i>In that entire time,

134
00:07:52,703 --> 00:07:54,646
<i>Sergeant Doakes makes sure of that.</i>

135
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,536
<i>He follows me everywhere now.</i>

136
00:07:56,641 --> 00:08:00,002
<i>My human bloodhound
incited by the scent of darkness.</i>

137
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:04,230
<i>My best hope of losing him
is to act relentlessly normal.</i>

138
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,288
<i>Dull. So I bowl.</i>

139
00:08:13,778 --> 00:08:15,800
<i>What's really disturbing
is that I'm good at it.</i>

140
00:08:17,454 --> 00:08:19,371
- *Holes*, Dex.
- *You pictured it, didn't you?*

141
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:25,792
Hey, striker!

142
00:08:25,951 --> 00:08:27,683
We need you locked down, tonight, huh?

143
00:08:27,814 --> 00:08:29,180
We're playing the Alley Cats.

144
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:32,619
I'm a little tense, Angel.

145
00:08:34,406 --> 00:08:36,505
But I'll try my best
not to let the team down.

146
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:38,613
<i>Try, peso, try.</i>

147
00:08:38,854 --> 00:08:40,692
You gotta think positive, bro.

148
00:08:40,981 --> 00:08:43,211
Cause what we think
creates the world around us.

149
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:46,180
It's all about energy
and interconnectedness.

150
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:47,729
I mean, you gotta think positive.

151
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:49,200
<i>Angel lost someone too.</i>

152
00:08:49,383 --> 00:08:50,723
<i>When his wife left him.</i>

153
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:52,351
<i>Now, he's going toward the light,</i>

154
00:08:52,718 --> 00:08:54,215
<i>searching for answers.</i>

155
00:08:54,372 --> 00:08:56,630
<i>He found one,
on an Oprah rerun.</i>

156
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:58,757
<i>I wish it were that easy for me.</i>

157
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,842
And we just got to direct it
to manifest what we want.

158
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:05,300
Alright.

159
00:09:21,369 --> 00:09:24,310
Dude, just bowl a strike so we can go
have some fun at the strip clubs.

160
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:26,200
I want to see a real 7-10 split.

161
00:09:26,475 --> 00:09:28,051
<i>I wish I could have fun.</i>

162
00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:31,635
<i>With Doakes tailing me,
my life's been all Jekyll and no Hyde.</i>

163
00:09:31,793 --> 00:09:34,760
<i>No moon-lit play dates,
no late night social calls.</i>

164
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:35,968
<i>Not one.</i>

165
00:09:36,939 --> 00:09:38,751
<i>My brother would be so disappointed.</i>

166
00:09:38,856 --> 00:09:41,246
Don't forget:
tell the universe what you need.

167
00:09:42,007 --> 00:09:44,672
<i>I really need... to kill somebody.</i>

168
00:09:59,118 --> 00:10:00,693
Did you even take my advice?

169
00:10:01,061 --> 00:10:03,792
I'm telling you.
The universe can be very generous.

170
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,241
<i>It certainly can.</i>

171
00:10:21,556 --> 00:10:23,499
<i>For weeks, I've known who was next.</i>

172
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,206
<i>Who belonged to me.</i>

173
00:10:25,888 --> 00:10:28,225
<i>I just needed Doakes
to take a night off.</i>

174
00:10:41,076 --> 00:10:42,415
What do you need?

175
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:45,269
I need to...

176
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,160
curse someone.

177
00:10:48,367 --> 00:10:49,654
What kind of curse?

178
00:10:53,915 --> 00:10:55,149
Death curse.

179
00:10:58,904 --> 00:11:00,873
We don't do that kind of thing here.

180
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:02,816
You can go down to Little Haiti.

181
00:11:03,052 --> 00:11:05,048
Find all
the Hoodoo Voodoo you need there.

182
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,883
You are Jimmy Senseo, high priest, right?

183
00:11:16,154 --> 00:11:17,651
The man with God in his mouth.

184
00:11:20,198 --> 00:11:21,747
I'm not a tourist.

185
00:11:22,351 --> 00:11:24,872
I need a Petro curse
and I heard you were the best.

186
00:11:27,195 --> 00:11:29,322
Thank you, for your offering.

187
00:11:30,102 --> 00:11:31,204
Come.

188
00:11:51,434 --> 00:11:52,563
<i>A blind man.</i>

189
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,112
<i>Not very sporting, I know.</i>

190
00:11:54,217 --> 00:11:57,499
<i>But I'm not one to discriminate based
on race, gender or disability.</i>

191
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,870
What... is... happening?

192
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:10,992
The only pertinent question is:
what happened to your victims.

193
00:12:11,623 --> 00:12:14,170
What are you doing? What do you want?

194
00:12:14,595 --> 00:12:16,802
I can see how this
might be confusing for you, Jimmy,

195
00:12:16,894 --> 00:12:18,679
but my favorite part's
kinda ruined here.

196
00:12:18,758 --> 00:12:22,073
This is where I normally show you
the innocent people you killed.

197
00:12:22,713 --> 00:12:25,338
I brought them along, anyway.
That's part of my death ritual.

198
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:28,032
Since you're blind,
I'll just remind you.

199
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:31,432
Emmanuel Azua.

200
00:12:31,747 --> 00:12:33,304
Jean-Philippe Peguero.

201
00:12:33,777 --> 00:12:35,011
Nono Baptiste.

202
00:12:35,142 --> 00:12:36,297
I didn't kill them.

203
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,319
I cast them.

204
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:40,603
And then a remarkable coincidence,

205
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:44,043
they each die of respiratory failure
with fluid in their lungs.

206
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:47,117
I guess murder is one way
to make your curses come true.

207
00:12:47,222 --> 00:12:48,508
Good for business.

208
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:52,500
What? What was that?

209
00:12:52,578 --> 00:12:53,996
Just the next part of the ritual.

210
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:59,182
How did you administrate
the ricin poison to your victims?

211
00:13:05,925 --> 00:13:08,866
I am the one with the power
in these hands.

212
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,279
That's not entirely accurate.

213
00:13:12,332 --> 00:13:14,590
Those who believe in me shall be free.

214
00:13:16,882 --> 00:13:18,064
Knock it off!

215
00:13:18,536 --> 00:13:19,980
How do you poison them?

216
00:13:21,451 --> 00:13:22,790
Not me.

217
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,074
Madulli,

218
00:13:25,298 --> 00:13:26,532
The Petro spirit

219
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:28,843
told me, put the powder,

220
00:13:29,302 --> 00:13:31,692
in the aguardiente bottles
that they buy from me.

221
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:34,762
And I did it.

222
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:36,863
Thank you, Jimmy.

223
00:13:37,204 --> 00:13:38,754
My ritual's almost complete.

224
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,038
Madulli curses you!

225
00:13:41,222 --> 00:13:42,086
You!

226
00:13:42,876 --> 00:13:45,554
I'm afraid Madulli's a little late
to the party on that one.

227
00:13:50,434 --> 00:13:52,561
Appreciate your helping me out tonight,
Jimmy.

228
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,079
I've been waiting a long time for this.

229
00:13:57,156 --> 00:13:58,626
I really needed it.

230
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:19,779
What the fuck?

231
00:14:38,548 --> 00:14:40,229
Let that be a lesson to you.

232
00:14:41,055 --> 00:14:42,578
<i>I've always enjoyed my work.</i>

233
00:14:42,867 --> 00:14:44,574
<i>It brings order to the chaos,</i>

234
00:14:44,731 --> 00:14:46,385
<i>fills me with civic pride.</i>

235
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:48,722
<i>But what was that back there?</i>

236
00:14:49,063 --> 00:14:50,298
<i>Not voodoo.</i>

237
00:14:50,725 --> 00:14:53,325
<i>When I picked up the knife,
it's like I didn't know who I was.</i>

238
00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:56,502
<i>I come here to dump bodies,
not beer bottles.</i>

239
00:14:56,607 --> 00:14:58,156
<i>Now, I'm just a little bug.</i>

240
00:15:28,939 --> 00:15:31,223
What are doing working out
in the middle of the night?

241
00:15:31,961 --> 00:15:34,246
- I couldn't sleep.
- Tomorrow's your big day.

242
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:40,075
Where the fuck were you?
I was worried about you.

243
00:15:40,469 --> 00:15:41,519
Bowling.

244
00:15:41,782 --> 00:15:43,121
Kinda late for bowling.

245
00:15:43,672 --> 00:15:45,615
Kinda not looking for your opinion.

246
00:15:47,191 --> 00:15:48,832
You said you cleaned the place today.

247
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,123
I did. It got messed up again.

248
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,390
I'll suppose you were looking
at apartment rental ads

249
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,810
while you were on the treadmill.

250
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:57,023
- If you want me out of here, just...
- I don't.

251
00:15:57,181 --> 00:15:58,494
I just had a bad...

252
00:16:00,202 --> 00:16:01,541
bowling night.

253
00:16:02,617 --> 00:16:04,980
What I meant was,
whenever you're ready to be on your own,

254
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:06,976
I'll help you with the transition,
that's all.

255
00:16:08,564 --> 00:16:09,640
Thanks, Dex.

256
00:16:10,683 --> 00:16:11,996
Thanks for putting up with me.

257
00:16:13,729 --> 00:16:14,858
You're all I got.

258
00:16:17,195 --> 00:16:19,086
It's not such
a great bargain for you, huh?

259
00:16:21,418 --> 00:16:22,652
I'm not complaining.

260
00:16:25,461 --> 00:16:26,354
Night.

261
00:16:26,801 --> 00:16:28,324
It's your turn on the couch.

262
00:16:28,507 --> 00:16:29,925
Could you at least pick up your...

263
00:16:31,697 --> 00:16:34,113
<i>Debra can't sleep
in an empty house anymore.</i>

264
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:36,594
<i>In fact, she can't sleep much at all.</i>

265
00:16:36,936 --> 00:16:38,852
<i>I guess that's what happens
when your fiancé</i>

266
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:41,531
<i>tries to slice you up
into small bloodless pieces.</i>

267
00:16:45,707 --> 00:16:47,073
Pathetic.

268
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:58,704
Did you see that?

269
00:16:58,835 --> 00:17:00,437
Nice shooting, Dex.
We need to talk.

270
00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:01,842
Those boars won't stand a chance.

271
00:17:01,981 --> 00:17:03,863
- Hope one charges me.
- No, you don't.

272
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,173
- That thing got massive stopping power.
- Slow down.

273
00:17:06,253 --> 00:17:07,434
I got bad news.

274
00:17:07,631 --> 00:17:09,233
They need me to take a shift at work.

275
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:11,596
Right now?

276
00:17:11,754 --> 00:17:13,986
- What about the boar hunt?
- We'll plan another trip.

277
00:17:14,196 --> 00:17:15,745
I waited two weeks for this trip.

278
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,681
- You can wait another one.
- No, I can't!

279
00:17:17,742 --> 00:17:18,981
If you read the books,

280
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:22,004
you know that psychopaths like me
have a low tolerance for frustration.

281
00:17:22,064 --> 00:17:23,273
Dexter, enough...

282
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,603
with the psychopath bullshit.

283
00:17:24,663 --> 00:17:27,081
You're in control of your urges,
not the other way around.

284
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:29,137
You don't understand, dad, I need this.

285
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:31,183
It's not just a sport to me.

286
00:17:31,288 --> 00:17:34,136
I'm sorry, son,
I have responsibilities at work.

287
00:17:34,294 --> 00:17:35,502
Now, come on.

288
00:17:36,224 --> 00:17:38,009
I'll drop you off at home.
Give me the gun.

289
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:54,505
There's cheese in that donut?

290
00:17:55,082 --> 00:17:56,526
Oh, that's a Danish.

291
00:17:57,262 --> 00:17:59,861
Look,
they forgot the frosting on this one.

292
00:18:00,543 --> 00:18:03,379
Some people like donuts,
plain, no frosting.

293
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,183
<i>I can't even get donuts right.
What's going on here?</i>

294
00:18:10,283 --> 00:18:11,504
Sorry guys, I was in a hurry,

295
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,971
I just ordered a dozen pastry-buffs,
like you two deserve better than this.

296
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:17,308
Thanks, Dexter.

297
00:18:18,745 --> 00:18:21,555
We're gonna go visit my dad
in jail today. Wanna come?

298
00:18:22,842 --> 00:18:24,181
Afraid I gotta work, buddy.

299
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:28,829
Thanks for getting here so fast.

300
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:30,036
What's the emergency?

301
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:31,401
Hip-Hop Harry is on.

302
00:18:44,717 --> 00:18:46,450
We're good for fifteen minutes.

303
00:18:51,543 --> 00:18:53,513
I know we're supposed
to have dinner tonight,

304
00:18:53,802 --> 00:18:55,246
but I just had this urge.

305
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,235
I'm all for satisfying urges.

306
00:19:00,944 --> 00:19:03,709
<i>I just wish I knew why
I couldn't satisfy mine, last night.</i>

307
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:23,846
- Is everything okay?
- It will be. Just keep going.

308
00:19:27,129 --> 00:19:29,334
<i>Any minute, now...</i>

309
00:19:41,286 --> 00:19:42,363
Sorry.

310
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:47,026
No, it's my fault,
I shouldn't be springing this on you.

311
00:19:49,284 --> 00:19:51,122
No, I'm just feeling...

312
00:19:52,251 --> 00:19:53,695
a little pressure at work.

313
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:01,890
<i>I'll be okay.</i>

314
00:20:02,257 --> 00:20:04,621
<i>I follow the code.
The stalk was good.</i>

315
00:20:05,477 --> 00:20:07,866
<i>I'm just a little rusty
since killing my brother.</i>

316
00:20:09,836 --> 00:20:11,923
<i>Or maybe I took pity on my victim.</i>

317
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,459
<i>I mean, sure, he's a heinous killer,
but he also bumps into walls.</i>

318
00:20:22,627 --> 00:20:24,045
Hey, Sergeant.

319
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:26,618
Thank for supporting the bowling team.

320
00:20:26,723 --> 00:20:27,773
Fuck you!

321
00:20:27,865 --> 00:20:30,071
Where's my blood report
on the Maynard victim?

322
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,543
So what's that?
A titty site?

323
00:20:38,248 --> 00:20:39,613
- Caught me.
- Bullshit.

324
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:42,029
What the hell
were you really doing in here?

325
00:20:42,738 --> 00:20:44,024
The tits are right there.

326
00:20:45,836 --> 00:20:48,330
But in ten years,
you've never rented a single porn title.

327
00:20:52,192 --> 00:20:53,453
How would you know?

328
00:20:56,236 --> 00:20:59,509
Call me an office crazy, but your
humbling interest in my personal life

329
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:02,282
could be misinterpreted
as harassment in some circles.

330
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,855
So, report me.

331
00:21:05,858 --> 00:21:07,722
<i>I could think of easier solutions.</i>

332
00:21:09,691 --> 00:21:10,873
Nice tits.

333
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,797
- James, you got any misdemeanor A-form?
- Filed in the filing cabinet.

334
00:21:25,579 --> 00:21:29,686
Can anybody tell me where the goddamn
misdemeanor A-forms are kept?

335
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,292
I've got some right here, Lieutenant.

336
00:21:34,016 --> 00:21:35,532
OK, alright, move along.

337
00:21:35,665 --> 00:21:38,107
Nothing to see here,
just another fucking day at work.

338
00:21:45,198 --> 00:21:46,773
Welcome back, Morgan.

339
00:21:47,842 --> 00:21:49,110
Thanks.

340
00:21:52,427 --> 00:21:53,451
Maria.

341
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,277
A tour boat guide called in
a body down at the Breakwater.

342
00:22:04,368 --> 00:22:07,698
I want you to take Doakes
and a support team. And take Morgan.

343
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,071
I want to get her back out
on the field today.

344
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,027
She's not ready.
Shouldn't even be here.

345
00:22:14,283 --> 00:22:15,885
What's it been, five weeks, six?

346
00:22:16,006 --> 00:22:19,089
Appreciate your concern,
but according to her psych evaluation,

347
00:22:19,306 --> 00:22:21,380
she's ready
to get back out onto the field.

348
00:22:22,882 --> 00:22:25,613
You just gotta look her in the eyes
to know she's not right.

349
00:22:26,032 --> 00:22:28,973
You put her onto the field,
she could melt down, freak out.

350
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:32,246
She hugged me.

351
00:22:33,404 --> 00:22:36,267
Alright, you partner with her today
so you can keep an eye on her.

352
00:22:36,608 --> 00:22:38,078
- That's...
- not a request.

353
00:22:38,365 --> 00:22:39,809
Put Doakes with Batista.

354
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:45,855
Fine.

355
00:22:49,374 --> 00:22:50,628
I know that it's difficult

356
00:22:50,705 --> 00:22:53,481
for you to take orders when you feel
that you should be giving them.

357
00:22:53,676 --> 00:22:55,908
And I really appreciate
your professionalism.

358
00:22:57,231 --> 00:22:58,733
Thanks. Thank you.

359
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:03,642
You don't like roses?

360
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:04,980
Allergies.

361
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:08,224
Let me know what you find out
about that body.

362
00:23:11,241 --> 00:23:12,667
Okay, guys, listen up.

363
00:23:19,801 --> 00:23:21,795
Heard your sister's
back on the job already.

364
00:23:21,966 --> 00:23:23,253
Is she in any kind of shape?

365
00:23:23,761 --> 00:23:25,687
Well, you know Deb,
nothing gets her down.

366
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:28,256
No, I mean, did she pack
on any pounds while she was gone,

367
00:23:28,332 --> 00:23:30,122
cause last time I saw her,
she was tight.

368
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:35,907
We got multiple chop wounds,
pretty much head to toe.

369
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,213
Alright, you call it.
Heads or tails?

370
00:23:40,133 --> 00:23:42,234
- Heads.
- Hey, I didn't flip yet.

371
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:46,228
- You said "call it".
- Damn, I always get the ass end.

372
00:23:46,905 --> 00:23:49,872
- Here you go, Sergeant.
- Nevermind.

373
00:23:53,487 --> 00:23:55,457
I got sharp force trauma here.

374
00:23:56,147 --> 00:23:57,696
Heavy impact, parallel wounds.

375
00:23:58,195 --> 00:23:59,298
Maybe an axe.

376
00:23:59,542 --> 00:24:02,431
No, the defense wounds on the forearms
are long and linear.

377
00:24:02,782 --> 00:24:06,080
I can make out bevelled margins.
A machete did this.

378
00:24:06,431 --> 00:24:09,340
The machetes are weapons of choice
of the 29th St. Kings.

379
00:24:09,591 --> 00:24:11,692
The victim was in the gang
judging from that tattoo.

380
00:24:11,986 --> 00:24:14,880
We think the body was carried
from a nearby location.

381
00:24:15,301 --> 00:24:18,372
I found a real good blood trail
coming down from the road.

382
00:24:21,864 --> 00:24:22,914
Lens.

383
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:28,887
Just make sure we check the dock's lifts
for criminal records.

384
00:24:29,022 --> 00:24:32,252
It's possible this victim was killed
by one of these boat owners out here.

385
00:24:32,589 --> 00:24:36,180
Or maybe it was just an easy-access spot
to dump a corpse at night.

386
00:24:36,293 --> 00:24:39,492
No light poles, and the freeway
exit ramp is just a block away.

387
00:24:40,127 --> 00:24:41,335
He's got a point.

388
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:45,201
Yo, Dex.

389
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:51,503
You're supposed to preserve
the crime scene, asshole.

390
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,615
What's the matter with you today?

391
00:24:58,253 --> 00:25:00,616
Just a little off my game.
I'll get it back.

392
00:25:03,228 --> 00:25:05,279
- What time did you find the body?
- Seven o'clock.

393
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,925
I start prepping the Banana Boat
every morning at seven o'clock

394
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,446
- for Miami Banana Tour.
- Banana Tour?

395
00:25:11,286 --> 00:25:14,113
It's a Calypso journey
through Miami's inner harbor.

396
00:25:14,218 --> 00:25:16,293
- And you should try it.
- I'll think about it.

397
00:25:17,268 --> 00:25:18,922
Ain't that the Ice Truck Killer's babe?

398
00:25:19,189 --> 00:25:20,817
She was in the paper.
She's fucking hot!

399
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:24,141
- Did you see anyone else out here?
- No, not this morning.

400
00:25:27,131 --> 00:25:30,004
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'd have given him a brochure.

401
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:31,499
Hey, Mrs. Ice Truck Killer!

402
00:25:32,362 --> 00:25:33,911
Oh, God. Hang on, hang on.

403
00:25:34,182 --> 00:25:36,483
Just turn around,
look scared for the camera.

404
00:25:37,771 --> 00:25:40,134
Well, if you think of anything else,
you have our numbers.

405
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,603
And you have mine.
Can I pass these on now?

406
00:25:42,761 --> 00:25:44,265
- Knock yourself out.
- Thank you.

407
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,227
Just look over here,
look scared for the camera.

408
00:25:56,766 --> 00:25:57,922
Thank you.

409
00:25:59,827 --> 00:26:02,032
What, you need help with something?

410
00:26:05,837 --> 00:26:07,009
Rafael!

411
00:26:07,726 --> 00:26:09,459
- Where is Rafael?
- Sergeant!

412
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,302
Grab her!

413
00:26:14,553 --> 00:26:15,883
Somebody stop her!

414
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:23,468
Goddamnit, Morgan, grab her!

415
00:26:49,972 --> 00:26:52,545
Can we please secure
this motherfucking crime scene?

416
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,171
What did she say?

417
00:27:03,677 --> 00:27:04,938
That's her son.

418
00:27:05,817 --> 00:27:07,366
She says she knows who killed him.

419
00:27:08,187 --> 00:27:09,710
Some guy named Little Chino.

420
00:27:12,033 --> 00:27:14,370
- Felt like she was asking me something.
- She was.

421
00:27:15,315 --> 00:27:18,177
She wants you to find Little Chino
and kill him like a dog.

422
00:27:30,553 --> 00:27:31,761
<i>That look...</i>

423
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:34,458
<i>I know that look.</i>

424
00:27:35,748 --> 00:27:38,322
<i>Like her mother, she wants
someone to do something.</i>

425
00:27:45,637 --> 00:27:49,055
And next stop on Matchie the matchbook's
magical journey

426
00:27:49,186 --> 00:27:51,430
down the rainbow path is...

427
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,785
the dreaded chocolate swamp.

428
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:58,347
Why is it dreaded?
I love chocolate.

429
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:01,804
Because the chocolate swamp...

430
00:28:01,951 --> 00:28:06,022
is the home of a goopey gooey
nightmare named Glappy

431
00:28:06,154 --> 00:28:08,331
who turns children to Fudgsicles
and eats them...

432
00:28:10,202 --> 00:28:11,594
What does Matchie do?

433
00:28:14,748 --> 00:28:18,582
Well, luckily, Glappy was sleeping,
so Matchie

434
00:28:19,002 --> 00:28:22,389
goes straight to Candy Castle
where he becomes King Candy,

435
00:28:23,012 --> 00:28:25,092
who can turn everyone into sweets

436
00:28:25,168 --> 00:28:27,869
with a wave of his royal gum ball staff.

437
00:28:27,945 --> 00:28:29,306
Cool story, dad.

438
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:32,191
But next time,
can we play the actual game?

439
00:28:33,351 --> 00:28:35,150
First chance I get,
I'll talk to the warden

440
00:28:35,282 --> 00:28:37,622
about finding some
of those missing game pieces, okay?

441
00:28:41,457 --> 00:28:42,848
Gotta go, kids.

442
00:28:45,144 --> 00:28:46,930
Alright, say goodbye to your father.

443
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:48,743
Jump, jump!

444
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:55,036
What's wrong with your lip?

445
00:28:56,314 --> 00:28:58,809
Well, I was biting it,
cause I was excited to see you.

446
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:01,122
So come back real soon, okay?

447
00:29:05,481 --> 00:29:06,830
Rita, one minute?

448
00:29:08,762 --> 00:29:10,232
Go wait by the door.

449
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,760
I need your help, my lawyer's
gonna file my appeal tomorrow.

450
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:17,759
But I don't stand a chance
without that shoe.

451
00:29:17,864 --> 00:29:20,218
There's no shoe.
How many times I have to tell you that?

452
00:29:22,653 --> 00:29:25,515
Anything, any evidence to support
the fact that I was set up.

453
00:29:25,953 --> 00:29:28,395
- You mean that Dexter set you up.
- Somebody set me up.

454
00:29:30,994 --> 00:29:33,462
Rita, I'm not doing
real good in here, okay?

455
00:29:34,067 --> 00:29:35,354
It's a federal prison.

456
00:29:35,903 --> 00:29:37,767
Hardcore. I don't belong here.

457
00:29:38,832 --> 00:29:40,040
Will you help me?

458
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,607
I need to go.
See you in a couple of weeks.

459
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,778
Will you please take Eva's statement?

460
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:01,674
Set up her daughter Marissa²with some crayons.

461
00:30:02,712 --> 00:30:03,762
Sure thing.

462
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,714
<i>That girl's gonna need more than crayons²to make her world right.</i>

463
00:30:23,561 --> 00:30:26,001
<i>Killing Little Chino²could restore my world too,</i>

464
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:28,586
<i>but only if he satisfies Harry's code.</i>

465
00:30:32,271 --> 00:30:33,649
I see you've been benched?

466
00:30:34,441 --> 00:30:37,490
LaGuerta is just jealous the Ice Truck²Killer fucked me instead of her.

467
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:41,669
You chipper.

468
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:43,454
I'm just happy to be back on the job.

469
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,290
What do you want?

470
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:50,141
I'm just working on my blood report²from the crime scene today,

471
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:52,121
and I wondered what you found²on the suspect.

472
00:30:53,028 --> 00:30:54,661
Cocksucker's guilty as they come.

473
00:30:55,266 --> 00:30:59,144
He's an inforcer for the 29th St. Kings,²East Side gang, intensely violent.

474
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:02,255
He's been linked to 9 murders²in the last five years.

475
00:31:02,973 --> 00:31:04,034
<i>So far, so good.</i>

476
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:06,234
<i>I just hope he's not blind.</i>

477
00:31:06,417 --> 00:31:08,424
- Has he ever been tried?²- Twice.

478
00:31:08,963 --> 00:31:11,018
But the witnesses in each case²were murdered.

479
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:12,489
We think by Chino himself.

480
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,617
Now, people²are just too afraid to come forward.

481
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,710
Come on, Chino! Right this way.

482
00:31:34,442 --> 00:31:36,424
Fucking beef bus!

483
00:31:45,266 --> 00:31:46,375
Dad!

484
00:31:48,135 --> 00:31:49,135
I'm okay, Dex.

485
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:50,412
I've told you

486
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:53,744
never put your finger on the trigger²unless you're shooting!

487
00:31:54,091 --> 00:31:56,117
- Are you okay?²- Jesus! That was close!

488
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,276
My heart's beating out of my chest!

489
00:32:00,341 --> 00:32:01,363
Let me feel!

490
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,096
- Feel what?²- Your heart!

491
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,066
That's amazing!

492
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,330
<i>A challenge.</i>

493
00:32:15,979 --> 00:32:17,214
<i>A mountain to climb.</i>

494
00:32:17,976 --> 00:32:18,976
<i>I need this one.</i>

495
00:32:19,934 --> 00:32:22,024
<i>Little Chino came to me front door.</i>

496
00:32:23,702 --> 00:32:25,361
<i>He ask for me son Rafael.</i>

497
00:32:26,285 --> 00:32:29,731
<i>Rafael did not want
to go with Little Chino.</i>

498
00:32:30,709 --> 00:32:32,181
But he was afraid not to.

499
00:32:33,435 --> 00:32:34,515
<i>What was he going to do?</i>

500
00:32:34,785 --> 00:32:37,351
<i>** has a ***
// spanish?</i>

501
00:32:38,055 --> 00:32:40,004
<i>Rafael was going to leave me with him.</i>

502
00:32:40,762 --> 00:32:42,537
<i>****</i>

503
00:32:43,019 --> 00:32:44,621
<i>I...</i>

504
00:32:44,775 --> 00:32:46,916
<i>*never ** leave this!*</i>

505
00:32:47,789 --> 00:32:49,067
<i>Eva!</i>

506
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:53,678
Are you willing to testify

507
00:32:54,623 --> 00:32:57,324
that Little Chino picked up your son²on the night of his death?

508
00:32:59,581 --> 00:33:01,196
Come on, don't back down now.

509
00:33:06,423 --> 00:33:07,806
<i>I want him to pay.</i>

510
00:33:10,122 --> 00:33:11,122
Got him!

511
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,537
<i>Oh, that's discouraging...</i>

512
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,170
<i>With a grieving mother as a witness,</i>

513
00:33:16,363 --> 00:33:18,591
<i>Little Chino will never reach²my cutting courtroom.</i>

514
00:33:25,426 --> 00:33:26,426
Hey, Morgan.

515
00:33:26,775 --> 00:33:28,039
You wanna see something swell?

516
00:33:28,357 --> 00:33:29,389
Come a little closer.

517
00:33:30,228 --> 00:33:32,728
And the token has spoken.²Good to see you too, Vince.

518
00:33:33,658 --> 00:33:35,838
I heard we captured Big Foot?

519
00:33:36,378 --> 00:33:39,128
Behold! The 8th wonder of the world.

520
00:33:39,996 --> 00:33:41,268
<i>Am I speaking clearly?</i>

521
00:33:49,546 --> 00:33:51,514
Then, answer my fucking question, Chino!

522
00:33:52,035 --> 00:33:54,157
What time did you pick up Rafael,²last night?

523
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:56,723
Last night?

524
00:33:57,254 --> 00:33:58,894
I didn't see Rafael last night.

525
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:03,224
OK. So, why would Rafael's mother²make up that story, Chino?

526
00:34:05,019 --> 00:34:07,690
That puta's into the devil's candy, man.²Fucking heroin.

527
00:34:07,903 --> 00:34:08,906
Shit.

528
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:11,202
She was probably high.

529
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,517
<i>You're telling me that²Eva Raines is a junkie?</i>

530
00:34:14,771 --> 00:34:17,886
If that's true, Pasquale and LaGuerta²are gonna have a piss party.

531
00:34:21,031 --> 00:34:23,519
Eva Raines, two pops²for drug possession.
// Ranez?

532
00:34:23,664 --> 00:34:25,844
No fucking way the D.A.²puts a drug user on the stand.

533
00:34:25,998 --> 00:34:27,310
That chulo's gonna walk again.

534
00:34:29,004 --> 00:34:30,304
<i>But not very far.</i>

535
00:34:36,299 --> 00:34:38,093
<i>We'll both be vindicated soon.</i>

536
00:35:11,472 --> 00:35:13,304
<i>OK boys, today's our day.</i>

537
00:35:13,864 --> 00:35:16,462
<i>If we find that galley,²it'll bring back gold!</i>

538
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,255
<i>There's an aberration on the sea floor.</i>

539
00:35:22,729 --> 00:35:24,584
<i>The crevice's at 65 feet.</i>

540
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,452
<i>It has to be²where the Santa Rosa went down.</i>

541
00:35:41,503 --> 00:35:43,858
<i>The crevice's 30 to 40 yards²straight ahead.</i>

542
00:36:10,247 --> 00:36:14,387
<i>Crevice should be 25 yards ahead.²Baring 1-1-4.</i>

543
00:36:57,833 --> 00:36:58,867
I need your help.

544
00:36:59,139 --> 00:37:01,744
I know how much you were²looking forward to going out, tonight,

545
00:37:01,804 --> 00:37:03,467
but I think Deb could use you more.

546
00:37:03,739 --> 00:37:06,159
Dexter, this isn't about²this morning, is it?

547
00:37:06,693 --> 00:37:09,364
No! I swear. This is for Deb.

548
00:37:09,539 --> 00:37:12,665
She had her first day at work, today,²and LaGuerta was kind of rough on her.

549
00:37:13,436 --> 00:37:15,173
- Dexter, unlock the door!²- Hold on.

550
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:16,867
Hold on!

551
00:37:17,063 --> 00:37:18,240
Dexter, come on!

552
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,114
Open the fucking door!

553
00:37:22,069 --> 00:37:23,593
See, she's yelling at me, now.

554
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,278
Look, I'm no expert, but I think Deb²could use some girl time tonight.

555
00:37:28,725 --> 00:37:29,728
I won't lie...

556
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:32,954
I'm a little disappointed, but I know²your heart's in the right place.

557
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,480
Absolutely.

558
00:37:35,785 --> 00:37:37,714
OK, whatever you need, Dexter.

559
00:37:38,115 --> 00:37:39,933
Thank you, Rita.²I will make this up to you.

560
00:37:40,411 --> 00:37:42,938
I'm gonna have Deb²pick you up in a half hour, okay? Bye.

561
00:37:46,948 --> 00:37:47,948
Sorry.

562
00:37:48,665 --> 00:37:51,809
I double booked when I made plans²to go out with Rita tonight.

563
00:37:52,002 --> 00:37:55,051
I forgot that I had promised²to sub for another bowling team.

564
00:37:55,942 --> 00:37:57,236
Why are you so happy about it?

565
00:37:57,732 --> 00:38:00,761
I like bowling, what can I say?²Look, will you take Rita out for me?

566
00:38:00,954 --> 00:38:03,850
- She hired a babysitter and everything.²- No way, I need to work out.

567
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:06,996
Actually, you need to stop working out.²It's getting unhealthy.

568
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,190
You should go out²for some nice hard liquor instead.

569
00:38:10,324 --> 00:38:12,098
- Sorry, bro.²- Deb, please!

570
00:38:14,469 --> 00:38:16,051
When do I ever ask you for anything?

571
00:38:21,067 --> 00:38:23,055
You bung hole.²Why did you have to put it that way?

572
00:38:23,336 --> 00:38:25,745
She's expecting you in half an hour.²You're a life saver!

573
00:38:34,034 --> 00:38:35,134
<i>Tonight's the night.</i>

574
00:38:36,696 --> 00:38:37,696
<i>Really.</i>

575
00:38:39,927 --> 00:38:43,554
<i>Harry would prefer I take more time,²but my life is falling apart.</i>

576
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:49,303
<i>Whatever stopped my knife before²won't stop it again.</i>

577
00:38:49,863 --> 00:38:50,863
Hey, there!

578
00:38:52,911 --> 00:38:54,532
I'm gonna work on my release, tonight.

579
00:38:55,265 --> 00:38:57,002
Practise, practise, practise!

580
00:38:58,563 --> 00:39:00,570
Lane's open till midnight.²You wanna join me?

581
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,760
Fuck it!

582
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:50,868
There's nothing else to talk about!²You are a liar!

583
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:53,016
- You lie!²- Would you stop?

584
00:39:53,286 --> 00:39:54,813
You gonna act a lot better!

585
00:39:55,058 --> 00:39:58,108
If you want me to act better,²then you treat me better!

586
00:39:58,282 --> 00:40:00,650
You got these things²all mixed up in your head!

587
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:02,433
Listen to me, I love you.

588
00:40:02,645 --> 00:40:04,118
Alright? It's all about you!

589
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,554
There is nobody else!

590
00:40:05,689 --> 00:40:08,869
Is that why you sent me²three dozen fucking roses?

591
00:40:09,876 --> 00:40:11,979
- Get out of my sight!- There's noboby else!

592
00:40:12,133 --> 00:40:14,071
I sent you flowers, baby,²because I love you.

593
00:40:14,236 --> 00:40:16,030
Get out of my sight!²I've got nothing else

594
00:40:16,242 --> 00:40:18,268
to say to you,²until you decide to man up!

595
00:40:19,368 --> 00:40:20,368
Please, go.

596
00:40:31,317 --> 00:40:32,317
Maria?

597
00:40:32,725 --> 00:40:33,725
Fuck!

598
00:40:42,709 --> 00:40:44,307
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

599
00:40:45,437 --> 00:40:46,846
That was my fiancé.

600
00:40:48,061 --> 00:40:50,231
We are having some problems.

601
00:40:52,276 --> 00:40:53,549
Well, that happens.

602
00:41:03,215 --> 00:41:05,244
I called his house 3 nights in a row²and he says

603
00:41:05,399 --> 00:41:07,319
he's working.²He didn't return my phone calls.

604
00:41:08,062 --> 00:41:09,943
And then he comes home²and he says he's tired.

605
00:41:12,329 --> 00:41:15,049
He is tired because he's out there²fucking some bitch.

606
00:41:16,053 --> 00:41:17,384
I can smell it on him.

607
00:41:20,509 --> 00:41:22,110
Don't worry about washing their hair.

608
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,534
- And read to them before bed.²- Okay, got it.

609
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,621
<i>You've a collect call from Paul Bennett.</i>

610
00:41:29,795 --> 00:41:32,457
<i>- Will you take the charges?²- Yes, I'll accept the charges.</i>

611
00:41:35,448 --> 00:41:36,448
Excuse me.

612
00:41:37,484 --> 00:41:39,838
<i>Rita, do you have a second?²I need to talk to you.</i>

613
00:41:40,051 --> 00:41:41,051
What do you want?

614
00:41:41,787 --> 00:41:43,157
I'm not gonna make it, in here.

615
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:45,838
I don't have time for your bullshit²right now, Paul.

616
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:47,517
<i>It's not bullshit!</i>

617
00:41:47,748 --> 00:41:50,457
I'm not like these guys,²I don't belong here, Rita.

618
00:41:50,671 --> 00:41:51,671
Can you help me?

619
00:41:51,848 --> 00:41:53,410
Help you? What?

620
00:41:54,693 --> 00:41:56,953
Just... Can you look²for the shoe one more time?

621
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:01,166
I found the fucking shoe, okay?

622
00:42:02,112 --> 00:42:03,886
You what?

623
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:06,616
That's great!²I'll call the lawyer in the morning!

624
00:42:06,751 --> 00:42:07,994
Look, why does it matter?

625
00:42:08,169 --> 00:42:10,243
It's just a shoe,²it doesn't mean anything.

626
00:42:10,706 --> 00:42:13,146
You were probably high on smack²when you lost it at my house.

627
00:42:13,339 --> 00:42:15,635
Whatever, I'll let the court²fucking decide that!

628
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:16,947
<i>It's a good news!</i>

629
00:42:18,533 --> 00:42:20,790
If you send a lawyer to my house,²the shoe won't be here.

630
00:42:21,002 --> 00:42:23,298
<i>I'm not gonna let you drag²Dexter into this!</i>

631
00:42:23,626 --> 00:42:24,996
I'm in a healthy relationship.

632
00:42:25,198 --> 00:42:28,710
Finally! And I'm not gonna throw it away²to bail out my abusive ex-husband!

633
00:42:28,922 --> 00:42:30,022
<i>It doesn't work that way.</i>

634
00:42:31,083 --> 00:42:32,083
Look, I gotta go!

635
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,385
No, you don't!²Rita, don't hang up that fucking phone!

636
00:42:35,587 --> 00:42:37,651
Stop blaming other people²for your problems!

637
00:42:37,883 --> 00:42:39,984
You're in prison, now, Paul.²Deal with it.

638
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,418
<i>Some gangs earn teardrops²of blood by killing.</i>

639
00:42:57,284 --> 00:42:59,212
<i>I understand.²We all need our keepsakes.</i>

640
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:02,041
<i>One man's tattoos²are another man's blood slides.</i>

641
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:06,496
<i>All I had to do was call the gang²task force, ask where the 29th St. Kings</i>

642
00:43:06,669 --> 00:43:09,508
<i>get their tattoes,²and wait for my prey to show up.</i>

643
00:43:17,503 --> 00:43:18,507
What the fuck?

644
00:43:20,474 --> 00:43:22,693
What the fuck! Get the fuck off me!

645
00:43:23,152 --> 00:43:24,619
Fuck! Get the fuck off!

646
00:43:26,509 --> 00:43:27,551
Fuck that shit!

647
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,937
<i>The scene of the failed crime.</i>

648
00:43:45,245 --> 00:43:46,808
<i>No better place to try again.</i>

649
00:43:47,194 --> 00:43:49,490
<i>I have it on good authority²the owner fled town.</i>

650
00:43:50,454 --> 00:43:53,464
<i>Plus it's a much quieter working²environment now without the chickens.</i>

651
00:44:11,814 --> 00:44:12,814
So...

652
00:44:14,322 --> 00:44:15,672
You and Dexter come here a lot?

653
00:44:16,733 --> 00:44:17,949
We love the Hot Wings.

654
00:44:22,671 --> 00:44:25,334
Look, I'm sorry²if I'm such bad company tonight.

655
00:44:25,604 --> 00:44:27,021
Paul called right before we left.

656
00:44:27,977 --> 00:44:29,057
Yeah? What did he want?

657
00:44:30,137 --> 00:44:31,137
Who knows?

658
00:44:31,372 --> 00:44:33,475
Make me feel bad he's in prison,²I suppose.

659
00:44:34,351 --> 00:44:37,555
I'm the one that answered that domestic²dispute call way back when, remember?

660
00:44:38,197 --> 00:44:39,876
That prick deserves to be in prison.

661
00:44:40,493 --> 00:44:41,824
I know, I know.

662
00:44:42,499 --> 00:44:43,499
I'm just...

663
00:44:44,176 --> 00:44:46,163
I can't believe²I still let him get to me

664
00:44:46,313 --> 00:44:47,868
after everything he's put me through.

665
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:54,379
Oh God... I'm such an idiot.

666
00:44:54,918 --> 00:44:57,876
What you went through²is so much worse than my problems.

667
00:44:58,429 --> 00:44:59,429
What?

668
00:45:00,203 --> 00:45:02,466
My psycho killer fiancé? Please.

669
00:45:03,211 --> 00:45:04,211
I've had worse.

670
00:45:04,773 --> 00:45:06,268
At least, he paid for my meals.

671
00:45:08,082 --> 00:45:10,166
I can't believe you moved on like that.

672
00:45:10,687 --> 00:45:12,076
I wish I could be more like you.

673
00:45:12,902 --> 00:45:14,082
I mean Paul was...

674
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:15,911
so horrible to me.

675
00:45:17,262 --> 00:45:18,516
Really horrible.

676
00:45:19,461 --> 00:45:20,465
Sometimes...

677
00:45:21,342 --> 00:45:23,011
And don't tell Dexter, but...

678
00:45:24,052 --> 00:45:25,052
Sometimes,

679
00:45:25,808 --> 00:45:28,007
I find myself missing²the good parts of him.

680
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:32,213
God...

681
00:45:35,897 --> 00:45:36,897
Not him.

682
00:45:38,965 --> 00:45:40,721
Not him. It's not him that you miss.

683
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:45,341
Because what he had to offer²wasn't real.

684
00:45:49,354 --> 00:45:51,321
The way he made you feel²about yourself...

685
00:45:55,585 --> 00:45:56,585
That was real.

686
00:45:59,453 --> 00:46:00,453
Hey, are you okay?

687
00:46:01,623 --> 00:46:02,623
Need a refill?

688
00:46:08,381 --> 00:46:10,108
Can I get another draught, please?

689
00:46:11,323 --> 00:46:12,539
Excuse me?

690
00:46:13,002 --> 00:46:14,603
Don't I know you from somewhere?

691
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:18,640
Haven't I seen you on television?

692
00:46:25,223 --> 00:46:26,371
Are you that girlfriend...

693
00:46:26,515 --> 00:46:27,741
What the fuck are you doing?

694
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:29,969
- Debra, what happened?²- He grabbed me!

695
00:46:30,142 --> 00:46:31,725
You saw him, right?

696
00:46:32,168 --> 00:46:33,644
- He grabbed me.²- I think you broke

697
00:46:33,779 --> 00:46:35,496
- my fucking nose!²- He fucking grabbed me!

698
00:46:35,631 --> 00:46:36,968
All I did was touch you!

699
00:46:37,107 --> 00:46:38,709
You saw it! He grabbed me!

700
00:46:48,696 --> 00:46:51,069
<i>He wasn't easy to get here,²but here he is.</i>

701
00:46:51,667 --> 00:46:52,844
<i>And here I am.</i>

702
00:46:53,465 --> 00:46:55,162
<i>Ready. Willing.</i>

703
00:46:58,172 --> 00:46:59,233
<i>Able.</i>

704
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,837
Shit!

705
00:47:12,293 --> 00:47:14,077
There's not enough tape!²Perfect!

706
00:47:37,288 --> 00:47:41,180
<i>39 days, 22 hours and 18 minutes²since I killed my brother.</i>

707
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,094
<i>I am cursed.</i>

708
00:48:15,383 --> 00:48:17,061
What the hell do you think you're doing?

709
00:48:18,248 --> 00:48:19,742
- What were you doing?²- I don't know.

710
00:48:19,877 --> 00:48:21,498
- What were you thinking?²- I don't know!

711
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:24,228
Whatever you're going through,²killing yourself is not the answer!

712
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:25,878
You don't get points for dying!

713
00:48:26,688 --> 00:48:27,688
Dying?

714
00:48:28,203 --> 00:48:29,708
Dad, I don't wanna die!

715
00:48:30,595 --> 00:48:32,775
I'm just trying to figure out²some way to feel alive!

716
00:48:38,295 --> 00:48:41,498
<i>I don't normally seek human contact²in times of failure.</i>

717
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:44,662
<i>But then, I don't normally²experience failure.</i>

718
00:48:47,479 --> 00:48:50,515
<i>Right now, all I can think about²is the smell of Rita's kitchen.</i>

719
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:54,296
<i>The breathy cadence²of her sleeping children.</i>

720
00:48:56,129 --> 00:48:57,617
<i>The warmth of her flesh.</i>

721
00:49:23,247 --> 00:49:24,327
What's wrong?

722
00:49:26,584 --> 00:49:27,857
The prison called.

723
00:49:28,764 --> 00:49:29,764
Paul's dead.

724
00:49:40,691 --> 00:49:43,600
He died in an inmate altercation.

725
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:46,552
It's a fight.

726
00:49:47,154 --> 00:49:49,507
He was angry, and he got into a fight.

727
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:55,063
Now, I have to figure out how to tell²my children their father's dead.

728
00:50:00,438 --> 00:50:01,595
And I could have helped him.

729
00:50:05,434 --> 00:50:06,434
How?

730
00:50:10,012 --> 00:50:12,308
How could you have helped him?²He was in prison.

731
00:50:15,356 --> 00:50:16,359
That's right, Dexter.

732
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:18,481
It happened in prison.

733
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:21,061
Paul was in prison.

734
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:25,885
That was his own fault.

735
00:50:31,335 --> 00:50:32,335
Was it?

736
00:51:08,883 --> 00:51:11,100
You okay?²Rita said you got in a bar brawl tonight.

737
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:12,151
You gotta see this.

738
00:51:13,911 --> 00:51:15,609
<i>Mount Pleasant, at 81 and Salem...</i>

739
00:51:15,744 --> 00:51:17,673
They've been playing it²on the news all night.

740
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:24,866
<i>Two treasure hunters²made a ghastly discovery today,</i>

741
00:51:25,194 --> 00:51:28,165
<i>when they stumbled on what appears²to be an underwater graveyard,</i>

742
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,268
<i>in a crevasse, off the coast of Miami.</i>

743
00:51:30,866 --> 00:51:32,370
There's bodies in those bags.

744
00:51:32,524 --> 00:51:36,576
<i>The butchered bodies were submerged²inside these heavy duty garbage bags.</i>

745
00:51:37,116 --> 00:51:39,933
<i>Authorities have located²at least 30 bags so far,</i>

746
00:51:40,164 --> 00:51:42,923
<i>but around the clock²salvage efforts are still underway.</i>

747
00:51:43,394 --> 00:51:44,494
Did you hear that?

748
00:51:45,188 --> 00:51:46,886
Thirty bags!²Do you know what that means?

749
00:51:48,082 --> 00:51:49,972
There might be²a new mass murderer out there,

750
00:51:50,127 --> 00:51:51,767
way worse than the Ice Truck Killer.

751
00:51:52,963 --> 00:51:54,815
Maybe I can finally get some peace!

752
00:51:56,377 --> 00:51:57,377
Isn't that great?

753
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:05,269
It's amazing!
