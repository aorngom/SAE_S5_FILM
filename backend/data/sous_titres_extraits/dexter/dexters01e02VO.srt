00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:48,834
<i>Previously on "Dexter"...

3
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,900
<i>Tonight's the night.

4
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:53,967
<i>And it's going to happen
again and again -

5
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,367
<i>Has to happen.

6
00:01:56,401 --> 00:02:00,134
<i>There he is.
He's the one.

7
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:05,768
You're mine now,
so do exactly as I say.

8
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,634
You better be a cop.

9
00:02:07,645 --> 00:02:08,630
No...
Forensics.

10
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:10,462
There is no blood
near the body at all.

11
00:02:10,503 --> 00:02:12,363
It's the weirdest thing
you ever saw.

12
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,733
<i>I've never seen such clean,
dry, neat-Looking dead flesh.

13
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,760
How is he doing? How does the
killer get rid of the blood?

14
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,451
One of these days,
you're gonna tell me.

15
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:23,300
I told you blood spatter
doesn't take up all my time.

16
00:02:23,338 --> 00:02:25,332
How the hell was your date
with Rita last night?

17
00:02:25,368 --> 00:02:26,232
Great.

18
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:27,980
<i>She's perfect because Rita is,

19
00:02:27,998 --> 00:02:30,631
<i>in her own way,
as damaged as me.

20
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,603
Open your eyes
and look at what you did!

21
00:02:33,635 --> 00:02:35,263
Please,
you have to understand.

22
00:02:35,306 --> 00:02:37,800
Trust me.
I definitely understand.

23
00:02:41,365 --> 00:02:42,581
Hello?

24
00:02:42,605 --> 00:02:43,843
What are you doing now?

25
00:02:43,908 --> 00:02:46,832
I'm just finishing up a little
project, but I'll come by later.

26
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,432
- They found another hooker.
- Une autre ?

27
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,360
That's the third one
in five months.

28
00:02:50,386 --> 00:02:52,003
Third?
You mean there's a...

29
00:02:52,028 --> 00:02:53,301
Serial killer, that's right.

30
00:02:53,365 --> 00:02:56,332
Dex, there are people out there
who do really bad things.

31
00:02:56,365 --> 00:02:57,713
Of course, you have to
learn how to spot them,

32
00:02:57,738 --> 00:02:59,262
but I can teach you.

33
00:02:59,407 --> 00:03:03,063
The killer flayed the skin,
the flesh, completely off.

34
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:04,130
Why would he do that?

35
00:03:04,168 --> 00:03:05,333
He's experimenting,

36
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:06,863
Trying to find the right way.

37
00:03:06,906 --> 00:03:09,483
<i>He's certainly raising the bar.
Damn!

38
00:03:09,987 --> 00:03:11,760
<i>This guy is good.

39
00:03:11,787 --> 00:03:13,102
The killer is an artist.

40
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:15,102
You give me the fucking creeps.
You know that, Dexter?

41
00:03:15,135 --> 00:03:17,250
Yeah, I know.
Sorry about that.

42
00:03:17,306 --> 00:03:18,880
But now we have a fourth body,

43
00:03:18,895 --> 00:03:20,462
and the cuts were different.

44
00:03:20,487 --> 00:03:21,843
And that's tellings a story.

45
00:03:21,858 --> 00:03:23,401
The ritual is changing.

46
00:03:23,438 --> 00:03:24,551
I'd like to check and see

47
00:03:24,587 --> 00:03:25,983
if any refrigerated trucks

48
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:28,532
have been stolen
in the last week or so.

49
00:03:31,538 --> 00:03:32,943
It just seems odd.

50
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,000
Your sister has
this ice-truck theory,

51
00:03:35,055 --> 00:03:37,403
and then here you are
to back it up.

52
00:03:37,436 --> 00:03:40,060
She's good, lieutenant.
You should give her a chance.

53
00:03:41,338 --> 00:03:43,231
<i>I think this is a friendly message.

54
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,332
<i>"Hey, want to play?"

55
00:03:45,368 --> 00:03:47,461
<i>And, yes, I want to play.

56
00:03:47,668 --> 00:03:49,560
<i>I really, really do.

57
00:04:10,907 --> 00:04:12,463
<i>I dream.

58
00:04:15,706 --> 00:04:20,302
<i>I dream I'm floating
on the surface of my own life,

59
00:04:20,336 --> 00:04:24,731
<i>watching it unfold,
observing it.

60
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:28,430
<i>I'm the outsider, looking in.

61
00:04:38,407 --> 00:04:40,333
Yeah! Man!

62
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:43,400
You want to play, man?!
Come on!

63
00:04:43,438 --> 00:04:45,063
In the water!

64
00:04:47,156 --> 00:04:49,963
<i>Look at them.
They can laugh and play.

65
00:04:50,037 --> 00:04:52,430
<i>It comes so easily for them.

66
00:04:54,705 --> 00:04:57,260
<i>Even though
I'm not one of them,

67
00:04:57,305 --> 00:05:00,121
<i>even though sometimes
I can really be a monster...

68
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:03,960
<i>today, I'm just...

69
00:05:04,007 --> 00:05:06,433
<i>...a sea monster.

70
00:05:23,536 --> 00:05:26,921
<i>Soon enough, I'll have to go
back to doing what I do...

71
00:05:27,566 --> 00:05:32,061
<i>So I make a point of enjoying
days like this when I have them.

72
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,331
Just a second.

73
00:05:49,175 --> 00:05:52,761
<i>The ice-truck killer left me
a gruesome souvenir.

74
00:05:53,108 --> 00:05:56,101
<i>Explaining it
could be kind of...

75
00:05:56,438 --> 00:05:57,601
<i>...awkward.

76
00:05:59,036 --> 00:06:00,331
Hey.

77
00:06:00,345 --> 00:06:02,103
Bagels,  brother.
Let me in.

78
00:06:08,405 --> 00:06:10,762
Could it be more
depressing in here?

79
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:14,860
Got anything to drink?
It's hot as hell out there.

80
00:06:14,906 --> 00:06:16,231
O.J.?

81
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:18,031
With ice.

82
00:06:22,605 --> 00:06:24,231
So, how you doing?

83
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:25,562
I'm fine.

84
00:06:25,587 --> 00:06:27,320
Yeah, things are fine.

85
00:06:27,335 --> 00:06:29,761
Breakfast, which I already had,
was fine, but...

86
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:31,833
you know me...
I'm always hungry.

87
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,301
So, what's up, hotshot?

88
00:06:40,336 --> 00:06:41,831
All right, get this...

89
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:45,553
Lieutenant's looking
for that refrigerated truck

90
00:06:45,578 --> 00:06:48,031
in every swamp, glade, and chop shop
from here to the Keys.

91
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:49,730
But the way I see it,

92
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:54,633
that whackjob truck driver threw
a severed head at your car.

93
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:56,233
It's not as if he's shy.

94
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:58,203
You think he's hiding the truck
in plain sight,

95
00:06:58,236 --> 00:06:59,353
wanting it to be found?

96
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,571
I could answer that if Laguerta
didn't have me back with my hookers,

97
00:07:01,576 --> 00:07:03,133
looking for a witness...

98
00:07:03,158 --> 00:07:05,691
Finding that truck is your
golden ticket into Homicide.

99
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:06,600
Tell me about it.

100
00:07:06,617 --> 00:07:09,230
Just because Laguerta has you
looking for hookers on her time

101
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:10,583
doesn't mean you can't look
for the truck...

102
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,942
...On my time!

103
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,333
What's with these?

104
00:07:15,376 --> 00:07:17,060
I've got court.

105
00:07:19,237 --> 00:07:22,401
Why is it we never talk
brother-sister stuff?

106
00:07:23,016 --> 00:07:25,670
Our dad was a cop. You're a cop.
I work for the cops.

107
00:07:25,705 --> 00:07:27,832
For us, this is
brother-sister stuff.

108
00:07:29,635 --> 00:07:31,501
Brings out your eyes.

109
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:39,333
<i>First he throws
a severed head at me,

110
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:41,932
<i>then he leaves me
these doll parts,

111
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:44,261
<i>like pieces of a puzzle.

112
00:07:44,305 --> 00:07:46,031
<i>I like puzzles.

113
00:07:53,465 --> 00:07:57,200
<i>But there's nothing more frustrating than
putting a puzzle together and finding then

114
00:07:57,987 --> 00:08:01,000
<i>it still doesn't make sense.

115
00:08:05,406 --> 00:08:08,031
Please state
your name and occupation.

116
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:11,431
My name is Dexter Morgan,
and I'm a forensics specialist

117
00:08:11,466 --> 00:08:13,031
in blood-spatter analysis

118
00:08:13,066 --> 00:08:14,861
for the Miami metro
police department.

119
00:08:14,908 --> 00:08:17,800
And how long have you been
doing blood-spatter analysis?

120
00:08:17,835 --> 00:08:19,262
Almost twelve years.

121
00:08:19,307 --> 00:08:21,463
You've been involved
in quite a few cases, then.

122
00:08:21,507 --> 00:08:23,630
2,103.

123
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,662
Give or take.

124
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:28,060
No, 2,103.

125
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:32,181
Then it's safe to say
blood is your life.

126
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:35,672
Safe to say.

127
00:08:35,707 --> 00:08:39,462
<i>Unlike the other guys down at the station,
I love coming to court to rub shoulders

128
00:08:39,507 --> 00:08:42,172
<i>with the good people
of the Sunshine State...

129
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,831
<i>...and Sasquatch.

130
00:08:44,968 --> 00:08:47,983
<i>In a courthouse, everyone's
on their best behavior...

131
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:53,601
<i>...like they're being watched.

132
00:08:58,165 --> 00:09:00,163
<i>And they are.

133
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,750
<i>Some  people would look
at this family

134
00:09:01,766 --> 00:09:04,033
<i>and see only tragedy
and heartbreak.

135
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:06,502
<i>But I see so much more
than that.

136
00:09:06,518 --> 00:09:10,002
I'll do this, okay?

137
00:09:12,005 --> 00:09:14,681
<i>I see opportunity.

138
00:09:16,638 --> 00:09:18,861
Alexander Pryce finished
his homework,

139
00:09:18,898 --> 00:09:21,750
kissed his mom,
went out for a jog.

140
00:09:21,765 --> 00:09:24,230
He told her he'd be back in time
to take out the trash cans.

141
00:09:24,267 --> 00:09:27,460
Just another night,
until...

142
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,531
...until the defendant
not only struck him

143
00:09:30,558 --> 00:09:32,382
with his car but fled the scene,

144
00:09:32,403 --> 00:09:35,903
leaving Alexander Pryce
alone and dying for hours

145
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,963
before his body was found
the next morning...

146
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,300
From heinous to unspeakable.

147
00:09:42,336 --> 00:09:44,873
The people will prove that
not only did Mr. Chambers

148
00:09:44,897 --> 00:09:46,800
strike and kill Alexander Pryce

149
00:09:46,835 --> 00:09:50,232
but did so while once again
under the influence of alcohol.

150
00:09:51,515 --> 00:09:53,511
Happy birthday, Alex!

151
00:09:53,737 --> 00:09:55,132
Thank you.

152
00:09:55,165 --> 00:09:56,590
- Rip right into it.
- What?

153
00:09:56,767 --> 00:09:59,161
- Yeah.
- Hope it's money.

154
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:00,661
Yeah, you wish.

155
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:01,831
Surprise.

156
00:10:01,937 --> 00:10:04,400
Thanks, guys.
It's like 80 degrees out.

157
00:10:04,436 --> 00:10:06,330
But next year
at this time,

158
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:09,202
we're coming to visit you
at Harvard.

159
00:10:09,237 --> 00:10:12,762
It's everything I've ever
wanted for you, Alexander.

160
00:10:12,805 --> 00:10:14,000
Thanks, dad.

161
00:10:14,035 --> 00:10:16,832
All right, enough corniness.

162
00:10:17,705 --> 00:10:19,702
<i>I see their pain.

163
00:10:20,135 --> 00:10:23,450
<i>On some level,
I even understand their pain.

164
00:10:24,105 --> 00:10:26,620
<i>I just can't feel their pain.

165
00:10:31,668 --> 00:10:34,091
<i>It just a Matter of time
before we see how far

166
00:10:34,107 --> 00:10:37,362
<i>Matt Chambers's crocodile tears
will get him.

167
00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:41,260
<i>But until then,

168
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:45,142
<i>a little of my favorite
tropical fruit...

169
00:10:46,267 --> 00:10:49,902
<i>The perfect driving food
next to a pulled-pork sandwich.

170
00:10:50,236 --> 00:10:52,931
<i>Also, I can keep my energy up
for the day job.

171

* ven conmigo... *

172
00:11:02,135 --> 00:11:08,131
* junto a mi corazón *

173
00:11:08,757 --> 00:11:12,361
* y me quite la vida*

174
00:11:12,545 --> 00:11:17,582
*si no tengo tu amor *

175
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,203
Detective!

176
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,933
- Buena.
- Buena?

177
00:11:26,236 --> 00:11:27,131
Did we get an I.D.?

178
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:28,813
First on scene pulled the wallet.

179
00:11:28,846 --> 00:11:30,090
We're still waiting.

180
00:11:30,136 --> 00:11:31,461
Hello, Dex.

181
00:11:31,705 --> 00:11:34,660
<i>Her boss -
Lieutenant Laguerta.

182
00:11:34,707 --> 00:11:36,703
<i>In keeping with her total sense
of entitlement,

183
00:11:36,727 --> 00:11:39,362
<i>she has this attraction to me.

184
00:11:39,805 --> 00:11:41,882
<i>And I thought I was creepy.

185
00:11:43,165 --> 00:11:45,372
Given the skin rupture
and the secondary spatter,

186
00:11:45,435 --> 00:11:48,033
distance had to be
a 50-, 60-foot drop.

187
00:11:48,065 --> 00:11:50,330
The eastbound's only 40 feet.

188
00:11:50,365 --> 00:11:52,812
It's not high enough
for this kind of damage so...

189
00:11:52,818 --> 00:11:56,133
...best guess, originating point
is the westbound causeway.

190
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:01,062
Get me a team
on the westbound causeway!

191
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,630
She's good.

192
00:12:02,665 --> 00:12:04,122
Angel, look at this.

193
00:12:06,468 --> 00:12:08,711
I think there's something
in his mouth.

194
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,233
Medic!

195
00:12:19,137 --> 00:12:21,562
It's just a death rattle.
He's gonzo.

196
00:12:21,587 --> 00:12:23,421
You better check
out my friend, too.

197
00:12:23,435 --> 00:12:25,362
No  telling what this guy
might have had.

198
00:12:29,038 --> 00:12:31,533
This is what he had.

199
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:36,263
Call me crazy, Angel,
but I think this is human flesh.

200
00:13:03,965 --> 00:13:06,602
Hooked up
with Sean last night.

201
00:13:07,617 --> 00:13:09,060
The cable-guy Sean?

202
00:13:09,107 --> 00:13:10,631
God, no.

203
00:13:10,668 --> 00:13:12,200
He  smelled like cheese.

204
00:13:12,237 --> 00:13:14,160
So the mechanic Sean?

205
00:13:14,205 --> 00:13:15,661
Yep.

206
00:13:15,906 --> 00:13:17,662
He came over.

207
00:13:17,706 --> 00:13:20,431
We opened a bottle
of Pinot gris.

208
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,460
We finished a bottle
of Pinot gris.

209
00:13:22,507 --> 00:13:24,201
Before I knew it,
we were...

210
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:26,001
Stop that.

211
00:13:26,037 --> 00:13:27,801
You don't want
to hear this, do you?

212
00:13:27,835 --> 00:13:29,202
No.

213
00:13:29,237 --> 00:13:32,230
But if you two are getting
serious, I'd love to meet him.

214
00:13:32,266 --> 00:13:33,760
Why don't you
and Sean the mechanic

215
00:13:33,765 --> 00:13:36,951
join me and Rita the girlfriend
for dinner tomorrow night?

216
00:13:36,976 --> 00:13:38,053
Why?

217
00:13:38,087 --> 00:13:40,492
So you can tell me later he's not
good enough for your little sister?

218
00:13:40,506 --> 00:13:41,302
Don't.

219
00:13:41,317 --> 00:13:44,281
You're the one who was going on about
brother-and-sister stuff this morning.

220
00:13:44,298 --> 00:13:46,903
And that becomes
brother-and-sister double-dating?

221
00:13:46,908 --> 00:13:48,352
Because I'm on head of yours.

222
00:13:48,378 --> 00:13:50,001
Come on.
It'll be fun.

223
00:13:50,007 --> 00:13:52,990
All right, we'll go, but I'm not
promising we'll have any fun.

224
00:13:53,555 --> 00:13:54,562
Not now.

225
00:13:55,307 --> 00:13:57,101
What crawled up his ass?

226
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:58,902
He hates lab rats.

227
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,932
Well, here's a headline...

228
00:14:00,968 --> 00:14:04,260
It's lab rats that make
us cops look good.

229
00:14:05,308 --> 00:14:07,140
Okay, listen up.

230
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:10,651
We just got an I.D. on the body
from under the causeway.

231
00:14:10,697 --> 00:14:12,321
His name is Ricky Simmons.

232
00:14:12,937 --> 00:14:15,003
He was a cop.

233
00:14:31,607 --> 00:14:33,862
- Let me ask you something.
- Yeah.

234
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:37,201
When we were partners, you used
to use every excuse in the book

235
00:14:37,236 --> 00:14:39,403
to get out of making
a next-of-kin notification.

236
00:14:39,436 --> 00:14:41,903
I knew Ricky from
the department softball team.

237
00:14:41,937 --> 00:14:44,833
He was a good guy, a good cop.
It's the least I could do.

238
00:14:53,468 --> 00:14:54,630
Motherfucker!

239
00:14:58,967 --> 00:15:00,500
Call it in!

240
00:15:03,005 --> 00:15:05,033
3H-77 to dispatch.

241
00:15:05,765 --> 00:15:08,402
We need E.M.T.
and police backup now.

242
00:15:08,557 --> 00:15:09,973
I'll check the house.

243
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:12,232
Kara, it's me.
It's James.

244
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:14,163
You're okay.

245
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,802
It's me.

246
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,011
It's okay.

247
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:25,603
This is so fucked-up, man.

248
00:15:28,566 --> 00:15:31,033
Going after a cop's family...

249
00:15:31,168 --> 00:15:32,921
Who would do such a thing?

250
00:15:33,008 --> 00:15:34,640
That's why we're here.

251
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:37,260
But it's still fucked-up.

252
00:15:37,305 --> 00:15:41,170
They're telling me Ricky Simmons was under
deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.

253
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:43,503
All right.
Thanks.

254
00:15:43,535 --> 00:15:46,031
He'd been working the gig for 10
months, and everything was good.

255
00:15:46,067 --> 00:15:47,713
But this...

256
00:15:47,788 --> 00:15:49,762
Going after his wife...

257
00:15:50,365 --> 00:15:52,981
Guerrero's crossing
a whole new line.

258
00:15:53,616 --> 00:15:56,560
Now he's gone and pissed off
the entire Miami police department.

259
00:15:58,337 --> 00:15:59,860
Is there any word on the wife?

260
00:15:59,907 --> 00:16:01,761
She should be
in surgery by now.

261
00:16:02,365 --> 00:16:04,081
¿Qué pasó?

262
00:16:04,637 --> 00:16:07,201
There's an inconsistency
somewhere.

263
00:16:07,798 --> 00:16:09,061
And that would be?

264
00:16:09,088 --> 00:16:10,592
I'm not sure, but it's
the answer to a question

265
00:16:10,615 --> 00:16:12,433
we haven't thought of yet.

266
00:16:20,036 --> 00:16:21,863
Look.

267
00:16:27,935 --> 00:16:30,461
- Whose is it?
- Probably hers.

268
00:16:30,707 --> 00:16:33,720
Ricky Simmons, her husband -
Last number dialed.

269
00:16:39,035 --> 00:16:40,452
I got it.

270
00:16:40,736 --> 00:16:42,303
Good work, Angel.

271
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:43,603
Well, actually,
it was Dexter.

272
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:44,930
Sergeant?

273
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:51,033
98, 99, 100!

274
00:16:51,068 --> 00:16:54,532
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a new world record!

275
00:16:55,537 --> 00:16:56,662
Stop it!

276
00:16:56,706 --> 00:16:58,300
Can't stop!
Must tickle!

277
00:16:58,338 --> 00:17:00,200
Got to hear the magic word!

278
00:17:00,237 --> 00:17:02,012
I have your magic word right here.

279
00:17:02,017 --> 00:17:03,303
Chocolate chip.

280
00:17:03,316 --> 00:17:04,652
Cookies!

281
00:17:04,706 --> 00:17:05,921
Homemade.

282
00:17:05,966 --> 00:17:07,562
Okay, you guys,

283
00:17:07,795 --> 00:17:09,761
take your cookies
into the bedroom.

284
00:17:09,808 --> 00:17:11,031
Two each.

285
00:17:11,067 --> 00:17:13,333
But you never let us eat
in our bedroom.

286
00:17:13,368 --> 00:17:16,331
Well, I want some alone time
with Dexter.

287
00:17:17,965 --> 00:17:19,860
Are you gonna kiss him?

288
00:17:19,907 --> 00:17:21,403
Actually, yes.

289
00:17:21,437 --> 00:17:22,603
Cool.

290
00:17:22,636 --> 00:17:23,702
Gross!

291
00:17:28,137 --> 00:17:30,281
Cookie?

292
00:17:30,707 --> 00:17:32,863
I wuv cookies.

293
00:17:34,468 --> 00:17:36,861
Well, you're snarfing them down
like the cookie monster.

294
00:17:36,905 --> 00:17:40,631
No, this isn't snarfing.
This is eating with enthusiasm.

295
00:17:41,765 --> 00:17:43,932
Tell me about your day.

296
00:17:44,307 --> 00:17:47,703
I had court...
You know, the blood thing.

297
00:17:47,735 --> 00:17:51,903
And then a crime scene
and more blood.

298
00:17:52,366 --> 00:17:54,401
I don't know how you do it.

299
00:17:54,438 --> 00:17:55,461
Well, blood is...

300
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:56,833
<i>...my  life.

301
00:17:56,937 --> 00:17:58,203
...my job.

302
00:17:58,236 --> 00:18:00,902
<i>Lately, the thing that
surprises me most about Rita

303
00:18:00,926 --> 00:18:02,642
<i>is how much I like being with her.

304
00:18:02,675 --> 00:18:04,882
<i>But whenever that happens
with a woman,

305
00:18:04,895 --> 00:18:08,231
<i>when I feel comfortable with
her, it all goes wrong.

306
00:18:08,977 --> 00:18:12,033
<i>That's why I think it's best
to take it one step at a time.

307
00:18:12,065 --> 00:18:15,603
Hey, you know,
Deb has been all over me

308
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,861
for us to get together
with her new boyfriend.

309
00:18:17,887 --> 00:18:20,032
You think you can get
a babysitter some night?

310
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:22,873
You mean an actual
grown-up meal?

311
00:18:22,908 --> 00:18:26,082
I'd love that.
Make a date.

312
00:18:26,088 --> 00:18:28,360
I pick you.

313
00:18:29,868 --> 00:18:32,831
<i>And I pick my sister to chaperon.

314
00:19:01,938 --> 00:19:03,601
Sister.

315
00:19:03,637 --> 00:19:06,133
So, Miami's the haystack,

316
00:19:06,156 --> 00:19:08,282
and the ice truck's
the needle, right?

317
00:19:08,307 --> 00:19:09,381
Okay.

318
00:19:09,407 --> 00:19:13,903
And, brother, I just found
the fucking needle !

319
00:19:20,238 --> 00:19:21,783
How'd you find it?

320
00:19:21,807 --> 00:19:23,102
I put the word out
with patrol...

321
00:19:23,126 --> 00:19:24,853
You know, the whole
hide-in-plain-sight thing.

322
00:19:24,906 --> 00:19:28,301
Juan Pierre flagged this one
and called me.

323
00:19:28,338 --> 00:19:30,101
This is a busy street.
Anyone see the driver?

324
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,383
The restaurant manager said it was here
when he opened up. Is this the one you saw?

325
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,362
<i>I feel like a kid
at his own surprise party.

326
00:19:37,405 --> 00:19:39,100
<i>This is the same truck.

327
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:42,002
It's hard to say.
It all happened so fast.

328
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:45,531
Let's go on a nonforensic-geek
limb here and say that it is.

329
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:46,762
Why is it still running?

330
00:19:49,107 --> 00:19:52,030
It keeps the back compartment
refrigerated.

331
00:19:59,205 --> 00:20:00,800
Dios mío.

332
00:20:01,738 --> 00:20:04,633
Holy shit,
they're fucking fingertips.

333
00:20:08,535 --> 00:20:10,902
Clean slices,
no blood.

334
00:20:13,938 --> 00:20:17,832
My guess is he drained the body entirely
before these cuts were made.

335
00:20:17,868 --> 00:20:19,733
How'd he do that?
Some kind of pump?

336
00:20:19,766 --> 00:20:21,032
No.

337
00:20:21,066 --> 00:20:24,433
I had forensics do a workup
on our last victim.

338
00:20:24,466 --> 00:20:26,400
Our guy's old school.

339
00:20:26,436 --> 00:20:29,002
Yeah, he hoists the body up,
severs the jugular.

340
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:30,700
The heart does all the work.

341
00:20:30,738 --> 00:20:33,430
It's the most effective method,
really.

342
00:20:33,468 --> 00:20:35,700
Fucking butcher.

343
00:20:37,705 --> 00:20:40,663
<i>There are 206 bones
in the human body.

344
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,902
<i>He could have left
any one of them.

345
00:20:43,936 --> 00:20:47,663
<i>But he gave us exactly what
we need to identify the victim,

346
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:50,932
<i>like he's leaving a trail
of bread crumbs.

347
00:20:54,766 --> 00:20:56,062
Who made the find?

348
00:20:56,685 --> 00:20:57,971
Officer Morgan.

349
00:20:58,088 --> 00:21:00,240
Harry's daughter ?

350
00:21:00,257 --> 00:21:03,000
Must be in the genes,
her and her brother.

351
00:21:03,675 --> 00:21:05,240
This truck's a good get.

352
00:21:05,467 --> 00:21:06,702
It's their first solid lead.

353
00:21:06,718 --> 00:21:10,372
I encourage all my officers
to think outside the box.

354
00:21:10,386 --> 00:21:12,431
Well, nice work, lieutenant.

355
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:14,303
I got the Deputy-Mayor.

356
00:21:14,535 --> 00:21:16,630
Congratulate Morgan for me.

357
00:21:27,707 --> 00:21:29,660
<i>Another beautiful Miami day -

00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,062

Chalk one up
for Miami metro, eh, ma'am?

360
00:21:35,265 --> 00:21:38,603
Last time I checked, Morgan,
I'm the lieutenant,

361
00:21:38,637 --> 00:21:43,461
which means my officers keep me
apprised at all times on all things.

362
00:21:43,507 --> 00:21:45,321
You pull a stunt like that again,

363
00:21:45,336 --> 00:21:47,202
it won't matter
who your father was.

364
00:21:47,296 --> 00:21:48,961
Okay?

365
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:18,702
Dude, is this blood?

366
00:22:18,738 --> 00:22:21,531
It's chocolate.
It's on your shirt, too.

367
00:22:24,206 --> 00:22:26,400
It's a new shirt.

368
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:28,860
What is taking so long?

369
00:22:28,906 --> 00:22:30,672
It's a big truck.

370
00:22:31,007 --> 00:22:33,861
<i>They won't find anything,
not even a Tic Tac.

371

00:22:35,905 --> 00:22:38,331
<i>I know I would.

Your famous hunches
telling you anything?

374
00:22:40,237 --> 00:22:41,600
Ice cold.

375
00:22:41,835 --> 00:22:43,361
You're a goddamn riot.

376
00:22:43,388 --> 00:22:44,732
This fucking guy's
toying with us.

377
00:22:45,077 --> 00:22:46,723
<i>Deb's right.

378
00:22:46,758 --> 00:22:49,590

<i>...They are.

380
00:22:56,637 --> 00:22:58,503
Watching ice melt...
This is fun.

381
00:22:58,537 --> 00:23:01,233
Stand a little closer, Morgan,
and I'll melt your heart.

382
00:23:01,267 --> 00:23:03,500
I think he's got a crush
on you, Dex.

383
00:23:04,557 --> 00:23:06,772
Yo, I was talking to Morgan
the sister.

384
00:23:06,867 --> 00:23:08,800
Vince Masuka
only swings one way.

385
00:23:08,855 --> 00:23:10,061
Yeah,
from vine to vine.

386
00:23:10,107 --> 00:23:11,030
Enough.

387
00:23:11,067 --> 00:23:13,161
I'm glad to see the
sexual-harassment seminar

388
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:14,613
really paid off.

389
00:23:30,435 --> 00:23:33,700
This is seriously
fucked-up, my friends.

390
00:23:35,137 --> 00:23:37,162
Why go to all this trouble?

391
00:23:37,595 --> 00:23:40,600
What's this sick son of a bitch
trying to tell us?

392
00:23:40,868 --> 00:23:43,331
<i>Not "us".
Me.

three times in one day?

397
00:23:57,537 --> 00:23:59,703
Sí, claro.

398
00:23:59,735 --> 00:24:01,230
Bueno.

399
00:24:01,268 --> 00:24:04,301
Kiss my baby and tell her,
"daddy be home para la cena."

400
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,832
I'm getting another call.

401
00:24:06,866 --> 00:24:08,162
Yeah, te amo.

402
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:10,931
Batista.

403
00:24:10,968 --> 00:24:12,960
¿De veras?
I'll be there in two minutes.

404
00:24:15,906 --> 00:24:17,402
She's still in surgery.

405
00:24:17,437 --> 00:24:19,103
The doctors are hopeful.

00:25:39,267 --> 00:25:40,532

It's a dangerous world,
Guerrero.

428
00:25:44,937 --> 00:25:48,133
Yes, and one can't be
too careful, detective.

429
00:25:52,867 --> 00:25:55,060
Yes, I-I've had alc...

430
00:25:55,406 --> 00:25:57,832
...problems with alcohol
in the past.

431
00:25:57,865 --> 00:25:59,530
I never tried to hide that.

432
00:25:59,566 --> 00:26:03,263
But... you heard
from my A.A. sponsor.

436

Ricky is dead?

452
00:27:14,137 --> 00:27:15,800
That saddens me.

Shut the fuck up!

454
00:27:22,467 --> 00:27:24,933
Wait, you're not implying

455
00:27:24,968 --> 00:27:27,000
that Ricky Simmons was a cop,
are you?

456
00:27:27,426 --> 00:27:29,600
I'm truly disappointed.

457
00:27:29,638 --> 00:27:32,161
Not only do I have a dead cop,

458
00:27:32,207 --> 00:27:35,832
someone broke in his house
and shot his wife.

459
00:27:35,865 --> 00:27:39,833
Word out in the world,
sergeant...

460
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:42,203
Simmons's wife
was fucking around.

461
00:27:42,236 --> 00:27:45,961
Maybe he tried
to kill the bitch himself,

462
00:27:46,006 --> 00:27:48,701
and felt so bad about it,
he committed suicide.

463
00:27:48,807 --> 00:27:51,263
A cop murder-suicide...

464
00:27:51,805 --> 00:27:54,603
It's a health crisis
for you guys, ain't it?

465
00:27:56,037 --> 00:27:59,001
You think it's a fucking coincidence
your ass is in here?!

the morning Ricky Simmons died!

467
00:28:02,408 --> 00:28:03,601
Bullshit.

468
00:28:03,638 --> 00:28:05,462
We don't deal in bullshit.

469
00:28:05,506 --> 00:28:08,382
We deal in good police work...

470
00:28:08,407 --> 00:28:10,100
And good science.

471
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:19,192
You must have been a
motherfucker at cat's cradle.

472
00:28:21,306 --> 00:28:22,860
I never played it.

473
00:28:22,907 --> 00:28:25,273
Okay, Kara Simmons was shot
while she was running.

474
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,802
Her phone call
tells us that, right?

475
00:28:26,825 --> 00:28:29,603
And she was running towards
the back door... There.

476
00:28:29,615 --> 00:28:30,721
She turns.

477
00:28:30,736 --> 00:28:31,683
The shooter sees her.

478
00:28:31,705 --> 00:28:33,963
She's shot high on the chest.

479
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:35,461
It spins her around,

480
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:37,931
spraying blood on the walls
there... and there.

481
00:28:38,106 --> 00:28:39,700
She loses her cellphone.

482
00:28:39,735 --> 00:28:41,563
She struggles
with the coffee table,

483
00:28:41,605 --> 00:28:43,703
the couch, and then
she finally falls back,

484
00:28:43,735 --> 00:28:44,701
"Pop"... There.

485
00:28:50,236 --> 00:28:52,362
She never got this far.

486
00:28:54,535 --> 00:28:56,331
It's not her blood.

487
00:29:07,308 --> 00:29:09,462
Angel, meet our shooter.

488
00:29:11,305 --> 00:29:14,433
DNA of Cervantes' flesh

489
00:29:14,465 --> 00:29:17,702
DNA from a rogue drop of blood
we found at the Simmons' house.

490
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,860
Tell me you're sure about this.

491
00:29:25,908 --> 00:29:27,462
100%.

492
00:29:27,605 --> 00:29:29,893
That puts Cervantes
at both crime scenes.

493
00:29:29,905 --> 00:29:31,643
Let's nail his coffin
and ship it.

494
00:29:31,708 --> 00:29:32,800
Hang on, sergeant.

495
00:29:32,835 --> 00:29:34,723
We get him to roll
over on Guerrero

496
00:29:34,755 --> 00:29:36,043
and we own them both.

497
00:29:36,045 --> 00:29:38,063
You're talking
about throwing him a deal?

498
00:29:38,087 --> 00:29:39,150
And then, what ?
He walks?

499
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:41,310
If he does, we pick him up
on other charges.

500
00:29:41,565 --> 00:29:43,793
If he gets us Guerrero,
it's win-win.

501
00:29:43,807 --> 00:29:45,601
Gets us Guerrero?!
We can't catch the guy.

502
00:29:45,635 --> 00:29:47,463
He's un-fucking-touchable!

503
00:29:47,505 --> 00:29:49,803
Come on, lieutenant.

504
00:29:49,836 --> 00:29:51,060
We already got a win.

505
00:29:51,086 --> 00:29:52,982
It's not about your win.

506
00:29:53,008 --> 00:29:55,261
It's about the big picture.

507
00:30:05,466 --> 00:30:07,463
<i>I've seen this before.

Davey Sanchez was
a fearless and dedicated cop.

511
00:30:17,966 --> 00:30:23,362
Davey Sanchez was a son,
a husband, and a father.

512
00:30:23,406 --> 00:30:26,762
Davey Sanchez was my partner.

513
00:30:26,808 --> 00:30:30,501
Davey Sanchez was my hero.

514
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,903
That was great.

515
00:30:38,266 --> 00:30:40,133
What, dad?

516
00:30:41,467 --> 00:30:45,300
Ever since Davey was killed,
my world feels out of control.

517
00:30:47,207 --> 00:30:49,260
How do you fix it?

518
00:30:51,108 --> 00:30:53,461
Two ways, I guess...

519
00:30:55,668 --> 00:30:58,503
Honor Davey's memory...

520
00:31:00,237 --> 00:31:02,872
...and catch the bastard
who did this to him.

521
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:07,622
It's not about vengeance.

522
00:31:08,237 --> 00:31:11,112
It's not about retaliation...

523
00:31:11,165 --> 00:31:14,103
...or balancing the books.

524
00:31:14,538 --> 00:31:18,002
It's about something deep inside.

<i>My father had more
than his share of pain.

00:31:37,335 --> 00:31:39,132
You celebrating?

531
00:31:39,165 --> 00:31:40,903
Something like that.

532
00:31:43,305 --> 00:31:45,350
Hey, have we met?

533
00:31:45,935 --> 00:31:48,430
I doubt it.
I just moved down here.

534
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,030
I needed a new start.

535
00:31:51,315 --> 00:31:53,360
Girlfriend or boyfriend?

536
00:31:53,407 --> 00:31:55,182
Ex-wife.

537
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:57,543
She said I drank too much.

538
00:31:57,987 --> 00:31:59,801
Hence the "ex" part.

539
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:01,003
Fuck her.

540
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:02,561
Man, she was all over me
to change,

541
00:32:02,606 --> 00:32:05,502
like she never done anything
wrong in her life...

542
00:32:05,538 --> 00:32:07,273
Besides marrying me.

543
00:32:07,295 --> 00:32:09,133
We all make mistakes.

544
00:32:09,188 --> 00:32:11,433
Unfortunately,
mine usually involve lawyers.

545
00:32:11,468 --> 00:32:13,883
God!
Damn it!

546
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:17,200
I thought I was the only one
who hated the Hurricanes.

547
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:18,803
I take it you didn't grow up
in Miami.

548
00:32:18,835 --> 00:32:21,401
No, I've had to move
around some.

549
00:32:21,435 --> 00:32:22,901
Say no more.

550
00:32:22,936 --> 00:32:26,021
But home
is where my ass is.

551
00:32:26,135 --> 00:32:28,073
I'm getting mine
out of town.

552
00:32:28,106 --> 00:32:30,310
Enjoy Miami.

553
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:34,922
Remember, there's nothing
a new city can't cure.

554
00:32:35,228 --> 00:32:36,960
You got that right.

555
00:32:37,066 --> 00:32:38,780
Thanks, buddy.

556
00:32:38,808 --> 00:32:40,751
Next one's on me.

557
00:32:42,866 --> 00:32:44,942
You sure you're good
to drive?

558
00:32:45,007 --> 00:32:46,821
Been a lot worse.

559
00:33:06,207 --> 00:33:08,832
<i>I sure hope he doesn't go out
there and kill himself.

560
00:33:08,995 --> 00:33:11,400
<i>That would be...tragic.

561
00:33:23,138 --> 00:33:26,601
<i>Matt Chambers is accused of
committing a crime in Florida.

562
00:33:26,636 --> 00:33:28,321
<i>He was arrested in Florida,

563
00:33:28,338 --> 00:33:30,040
<i>and he's being tried
in Florida.

564
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:33,901
<i>So the good people of Florida

565
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:36,250
<i>only went as far as validating
their own assumptions

566
00:33:36,566 --> 00:33:39,320
<i>that Matt Chambers
is a Florida bad guy.

567
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:04,060
<i>"Nothing a new city
can't cure."

568
00:34:09,566 --> 00:34:12,181
<i>My father taught me
one thing above all others...

569
00:34:12,205 --> 00:34:14,170
<i>To be sure.

570
00:34:14,537 --> 00:34:15,850
<i>And I am.

571
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:19,282
<i>Matt Chambers,
Miami is your last stop.

572
00:34:20,505 --> 00:34:24,133
<i>If God is in the details,
and if I believed in God,

573
00:34:24,165 --> 00:34:26,303
<i>then he's in this room with me.

574
00:34:28,368 --> 00:34:31,361
<i>I just wish he'd brought
an extension cord.

575
00:34:37,435 --> 00:34:38,961
It's James.

576
00:34:39,207 --> 00:34:42,262
We're gonna get the bastard
who did this to you.

577
00:35:06,235 --> 00:35:08,092
This guy is just toying with us,

578
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:09,901
and Laguerta's
too fucking dumb to see it.

579
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:11,953
Yeah, Deb was saying
that this psycho guy

580
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:14,062
cut off that
chick's fingertips?

581
00:35:14,307 --> 00:35:17,130
Man, that's got to suck, right?

582
00:35:19,865 --> 00:35:23,503
<i>Guerrero taking home lobsters
to boil alive -

583
00:35:23,675 --> 00:35:25,761
<i>That's not his style.

584
00:35:25,776 --> 00:35:30,362
<i>He usually leaves the killing
to someone else.

585
00:35:30,638 --> 00:35:32,692
So, how long have you two
been going out?

586
00:35:33,807 --> 00:35:35,441
A couple weeks, I guess.

587
00:35:35,506 --> 00:35:37,690
Deb never mentioned
how you met.

588
00:35:37,906 --> 00:35:40,760
Well, she brought her car
into my shop, and...

589
00:35:40,855 --> 00:35:42,370
You have your own place?

590
00:35:43,038 --> 00:35:45,411
No, but I wish I did.

591
00:35:52,566 --> 00:35:54,132
Some day, huh?

592
00:35:54,158 --> 00:35:56,401
Dex, enough
with the Inquisition.

593
00:35:56,426 --> 00:35:57,613
No, it's all right.

594
00:35:57,665 --> 00:35:59,631
If I had a sister
with legs like yours,

595
00:35:59,647 --> 00:36:02,103
I'd be checking out the dude
she was seeing, too.

596
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,502
Is this guy a keeper
or what?

597
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:10,002
Come on.
I'll get you another drink.

598
00:36:10,036 --> 00:36:12,130
Are you guys good?

599
00:36:12,168 --> 00:36:13,531
Yep.

600
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,063
Seems like a nice guy.

601
00:36:21,508 --> 00:36:24,903
They could barely keep
their hands off each other.

602
00:36:24,937 --> 00:36:27,862
<i>I can kill a man,
dismember his body,

603

604
00:36:30,806 --> 00:36:34,953
<i>But knowing what to say when
my girlfriend's feeling insecure...

605
00:36:35,405 --> 00:36:37,443
<i>I'm totally lost.

606
00:36:40,836 --> 00:36:42,613
Off your ass, Cervantes.

607
00:36:42,627 --> 00:36:46,001
Hands behind your back.
Walk backwards and assume the position.

608
00:36:55,366 --> 00:36:57,133
Step away.

609
00:37:03,936 --> 00:37:05,661
Exit the cell.

610
00:37:07,866 --> 00:37:09,200
Where are we going?

611
00:37:09,237 --> 00:37:10,660
The call came down.

612
00:37:10,808 --> 00:37:13,001
They want you moved
to a more secure block.

613
00:37:17,605 --> 00:37:21,062
You think the call to take care
of me came down from the warden?

614
00:37:21,107 --> 00:37:24,533
Who the fuck do you think
the warden listens to?

615
00:37:26,365 --> 00:37:27,763
Get used to it.

616
00:37:32,138 --> 00:37:34,101
That's from Mr. Guerrero.

617
00:37:40,936 --> 00:37:43,003
* Are you sleeping?*

618
00:37:43,036 --> 00:37:46,802
* Are you sleeping?*

619
00:37:46,835 --> 00:37:49,432
* Brother John*

620
00:37:49,456 --> 00:37:53,643
* Brother John*

621
00:37:54,336 --> 00:37:57,470
* Morning bells are ringing*

622
00:37:57,495 --> 00:38:01,293
* Morning bells are ringing*

623
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:04,272
* Ding ding dong*

624
00:38:05,768 --> 00:38:08,581
* Ding ding dong*

625
00:38:32,636 --> 00:38:36,132
<i>Every time a woman

626

00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:42,033
<i>Still, it's not entirely unpleasant.

628
00:38:42,066 --> 00:38:43,403
What?

629
00:38:43,435 --> 00:38:44,862
The kids.

630
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:49,003
They sleep through thunderstorms.

631
00:39:20,016 --> 00:39:22,100
I'm sorry.

632
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,490
Tell me... wh...?

633
00:39:31,188 --> 00:39:34,202
I- I can't do this.

634
00:39:35,197 --> 00:39:37,290
It's okay.

635
00:39:37,867 --> 00:39:40,121
That's okay.

636
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:42,512
I'm okay.

637
00:39:46,988 --> 00:39:50,350
We have an elephant in the room,
and its name is "Sex."

638
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:53,512
Tell me about it.

639
00:39:54,786 --> 00:39:56,183
As far as I'm concerned,

640
00:39:56,217 --> 00:39:59,950
it can just stay in the corner
and mind its own damn business.

641
00:40:01,288 --> 00:40:03,851
It's easier said than done.

642
00:40:05,185 --> 00:40:07,182
Yeah.

643
00:40:08,217 --> 00:40:12,151
But it needs to be right...

644
00:40:12,187 --> 00:40:14,611
For both of us.

645
00:40:16,158 --> 00:40:19,712
Or it won't be right
for either of us.

646
00:40:22,156 --> 00:40:24,080
I don't want that.
Do you?

647
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,653
No.

648
00:40:28,687 --> 00:40:30,481
You know...

649
00:40:33,586 --> 00:40:34,941
I can't believe I found

650
00:40:34,956 --> 00:40:38,512
the one good, truly decent
man left on the planet.

651
00:40:41,057 --> 00:40:43,100

Notice how the skin is gloving
around the joints?

658
00:41:23,487 --> 00:41:25,612
And that is important
because?

659
00:41:25,636 --> 00:41:28,241
A sure sign of postmortem
severance, meaning

660
00:41:28,246 --> 00:41:30,683
the victim was already
dead when she was...

661
00:41:30,758 --> 00:41:32,353
...relieved of her fingertips.

662
00:41:32,388 --> 00:41:34,251
Why the different nail polishes?

663

- At least he's consistent.
- Yeah.

668
00:41:45,386 --> 00:41:49,563
Killing young women who have to

Her.

678
00:42:35,787 --> 00:42:37,613
You wanted to see me, sir?

679

Lieutenant Laguerta has
something she wants to tell you.

680
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,880
Officer Morgan,

681
00:42:43,086 --> 00:42:44,813
you've shown
tremendous initiative

682
00:42:44,835 --> 00:42:46,493
these last few days.

683
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:49,371
Because of you, we were able to
track down that ice truck,

684
00:42:49,385 --> 00:42:52,703
and we now have an I.D.
on the latest victim.

685
00:42:53,017 --> 00:42:56,652
The Captain believes you should be
reassigned from Vice to Homicide.

686
00:42:57,005 --> 00:43:00,192
And I concur.
Congratulations.

687
00:43:00,205 --> 00:43:01,571
You're a good cop,

688
00:43:01,615 --> 00:43:03,310
like your old man.

689
00:43:04,016 --> 00:43:05,610
Thank you, sir!

690
00:43:09,518 --> 00:43:10,892
Thank you so much.

691
00:43:10,928 --> 00:43:13,992
You keep this up and I see
a detective shield in your future.

692
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:16,133
I won't let you down, sir.

693
00:43:23,056 --> 00:43:25,060
I hope you know
what you're doing.

694
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:28,170
I promoted you, didn't I?

695
00:43:28,515 --> 00:43:31,451
Now find me

696
00:43:35,985 --> 00:43:38,961
- Okay?
- Okay.

697
00:43:40,986 --> 00:43:42,453
Y nina

00:43:42,506 --> 00:43:44,310

00:43:44,807 --> 00:43:47,251
Están maravillosas.

700
00:43:48,785 --> 00:43:51,472

Okay.

00:44:05,455 --> 00:44:06,681
Burning the oil?

704
00:44:07,016 --> 00:44:08,992
I clocked out.

705
00:44:11,288 --> 00:44:13,461
Why are you going at this
so hard?

706
00:44:13,816 --> 00:44:16,732
When someone comes after one of us,
he comes after all of us.

707
00:44:22,156 --> 00:44:23,500
I know that look, Maria.

708
00:44:23,526 --> 00:44:25,051
You got something to say,
just say it.

709
00:44:26,117 --> 00:44:28,211
I just got off the phone
with the hospital.

710
00:44:30,217 --> 00:44:33,271
Kara Simmons suffered massive
heart failure 30 minutes ago.

711
00:44:33,388 --> 00:44:34,810
I got to be there.

712
00:44:36,118 --> 00:44:37,810
James, she died.

713
00:44:51,916 --> 00:44:54,122
Was Cervantes right?

714
00:44:55,517 --> 00:44:58,732
Was Kara sleeping with someone
other than Ricky?

715
00:45:02,055 --> 00:45:03,472
Was it you?

716
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:10,101
What the fuck
were you thinking?!

717
00:45:10,116 --> 00:45:11,710
What the fuck business
is it of yours?!

718
00:45:11,757 --> 00:45:15,450
My cops, my precinct, my business!

719
00:45:15,486 --> 00:45:17,582
Kara was gonna ask Ricky
for a divorce

720
00:45:17,618 --> 00:45:21,032
as soon as he came off undercover.
She didn't want to...

721
00:45:21,115 --> 00:45:23,431
She didn't want to hurt him
when he was on the case.

722
00:45:27,615 --> 00:45:30,263
If I go by the book,
I take you off the case.

723
00:45:30,277 --> 00:45:31,752
Fuck the book.

724
00:45:31,786 --> 00:45:33,751
There's nobody in this building
more motivated to get...

725
00:45:33,767 --> 00:45:35,213
Revenge?

726
00:45:35,458 --> 00:45:37,511
Justice.

727
00:45:46,886 --> 00:45:48,782
Take point on Guerrero.

728
00:45:52,956 --> 00:45:54,782
Thanks.

729
00:45:57,086 --> 00:45:58,360
<i>In slaughterhouses,

730
00:45:58,387 --> 00:46:01,241
<i>they stun the animals
before butchering them.

731
00:46:01,457 --> 00:46:03,513
<i>It's the humane thing to do.

732
00:46:03,557 --> 00:46:05,171
<i>Those animals,

733
00:46:05,487 --> 00:46:08,182
<i>they're the lucky ones.

734
00:46:22,615 --> 00:46:25,211
"Brother, meet me
at Loco's Crab Shack.

735
00:46:25,256 --> 00:46:28,381
"Totally important.
Do not let me down. Deb."

736
00:46:29,518 --> 00:46:31,353
<i>Gone to rest his weary head.

737
00:46:31,487 --> 00:46:33,050
<i>The good news is,
he'll still be here

738
00:46:33,077 --> 00:46:36,353
<i>when I come back for
our own personal happy hour.

739
00:46:39,117 --> 00:46:41,311
God, these are so good.

740
00:46:41,357 --> 00:46:43,510
Not as good
as your good news.

741
00:46:44,017 --> 00:46:47,552
My little sister's all growed-up
and transferred to Homicide.

742
00:46:50,786 --> 00:46:52,250
And the best part...

743
00:46:52,868 --> 00:46:55,800
Laguerta had to say
the actual words.

744
00:46:55,815 --> 00:46:57,481
I thought her head would explode.

745
00:46:57,516 --> 00:46:59,153
I'm really proud of you.

746
00:46:59,186 --> 00:47:01,513
You had my back the whole way,
and I appreciate it.

747
00:47:02,026 --> 00:47:03,352
I mean that.

748
00:47:03,377 --> 00:47:04,682
You're the best.

749
00:47:04,715 --> 00:47:07,203
And that's why I wanted
to share this moment with you.

750
00:47:07,557 --> 00:47:09,813
So, Sean was busy?

751
00:47:11,147 --> 00:47:13,712
It turns out
there's another woman.

752
00:47:14,036 --> 00:47:15,382
Who?

753
00:47:16,316 --> 00:47:17,613
Me.

754
00:47:17,957 --> 00:47:19,903
Sean the mechanic
is married?

755
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:22,311
Imagine me picking
the wrong guy, huh?

756
00:47:22,755 --> 00:47:24,483
And you and he are...

757
00:47:24,517 --> 00:47:25,653
So over.

758
00:47:25,687 --> 00:47:27,613
I dumped his married ass.

759
00:47:27,685 --> 00:47:29,832
I just wish I could get
into a healthy relationship,

760
00:47:29,956 --> 00:47:31,003
like you and Rita,

761
00:47:31,517 --> 00:47:34,893
without the drama and the tension
and the uncertainty.

762
00:47:35,615 --> 00:47:38,051
Yeah, I'm a lucky guy.

763
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:57,682
Jesus, dad, it's called being on time!
Did you ever hear of it?

764
00:47:58,017 --> 00:47:59,881
I was having a bad day.

765
00:47:59,908 --> 00:48:01,572
The Captain and I
had a discussion.

766
00:48:01,685 --> 00:48:03,751
Well, maybe you sh...

767
00:48:04,018 --> 00:48:06,310
Wait.
W- What kind of bad day?

768
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:10,803
It's about the guy
who killed Davey, isn't it?

769
00:48:10,815 --> 00:48:14,241
The judge said the bust wasn't
righteous and let him walk.

770
00:48:15,218 --> 00:48:17,680
That guy kills a cop,
and nothing happens?

771
00:48:19,388 --> 00:48:20,882
That's not fair.

772
00:48:20,905 --> 00:48:22,650
Life's not fair, Dexter.

773
00:48:23,656 --> 00:48:25,322
Can't anyone do anything?

774
00:48:25,457 --> 00:48:27,363
Can't you do something?

775
00:48:28,485 --> 00:48:30,390
No, not now.

776
00:48:32,817 --> 00:48:34,411
So what, then?

777
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:37,212
The world just keeps
spinning out of control?

778
00:48:39,355 --> 00:48:40,913
No.

779
00:48:41,655 --> 00:48:44,512
The world can always
be set right again.

780
00:48:45,317 --> 00:48:48,680
<i>That guy kills a cop,
and nothing happens?

781
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:50,520
<i>Not anymore.

782
00:48:51,055 --> 00:48:52,780
Be back in a sec.

783
00:48:53,618 --> 00:48:55,780
I'm kind of running the gamut
here emotion-wise.

784
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,532
Nature calls.

785
00:48:58,416 --> 00:49:01,943
<i>All the planning,
the making sure...

786
00:49:02,418 --> 00:49:04,291
<i>Does it go away
because I have a chance

787
00:49:04,317 --> 00:49:08,322
<i>to rid the world of a cop
killer and balance the books?

788
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:10,013
<i>Do I just ignore

789
00:49:10,036 --> 00:49:12,921
<i>everything my father taught me
about how to do this right,

790
00:49:13,057 --> 00:49:16,750
<i>about how to stay safe
so I can do it again?

791
00:49:24,785 --> 00:49:26,443
Yep.

792
00:49:28,157 --> 00:49:31,210
I don't give a shit
about your goddamn problems.

793
00:49:31,257 --> 00:49:33,853
I gave you a job.
You take care of it.

794
00:49:37,616 --> 00:49:39,403
What the fuck
you looking at?

795
00:49:51,856 --> 00:49:54,200
<i>Happy birthday, Alex!
Rip right into it.

796
00:50:06,556 --> 00:50:08,282
<i>But next year
at this time...

797
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:10,460
It's you.

798
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:12,713
And you.

799
00:50:12,755 --> 00:50:15,781
<i>Thanks, dad.

800
00:50:18,816 --> 00:50:20,310
<i>All right,
enough corniness.

801
00:50:20,357 --> 00:50:22,313
We meet again...

802
00:50:30,185 --> 00:50:31,611
...for the last time.

803
00:50:34,416 --> 00:50:36,810
I didn't do anyth-
Anything.

804
00:50:36,856 --> 00:50:38,852
Some people believe that.

805
00:50:41,218 --> 00:50:42,672
The problem is, I don't.

806
00:50:43,087 --> 00:50:44,912
But it's true.

807
00:50:44,956 --> 00:50:46,452
I was - I was set up.

808
00:50:49,257 --> 00:50:50,653
By whom?

809
00:50:50,685 --> 00:50:54,113
That - That family.

810
00:50:55,457 --> 00:50:59,351
They needed someone to blame. It's a
natural thing to do when you're grieving.

811
00:50:59,415 --> 00:51:01,182
So then none of this
is your fault?

812
00:51:01,215 --> 00:51:02,753
I swear.

813
00:51:03,885 --> 00:51:06,051
Okay! Okay! Okay!
No!

814
00:51:06,087 --> 00:51:08,013
Okay. Okay. Stop.

815
00:51:08,057 --> 00:51:09,812
All right.

816
00:51:09,856 --> 00:51:11,012
Okay, okay.

817
00:51:11,058 --> 00:51:14,082
It - It was me,
only it wasn't me.

818
00:51:14,118 --> 00:51:15,982
It was the booze.

819
00:51:16,018 --> 00:51:18,253
It takes me over.

820
00:51:18,286 --> 00:51:21,781
That's a point of view to which
I'm not entirely unsympathetic.

821
00:51:22,236 --> 00:51:24,513
Neither you nor I

822
00:51:24,655 --> 00:51:28,913
is in complete control
of our destinies.

823
00:51:29,658 --> 00:51:31,280
Although, at the moment,

824
00:51:31,305 --> 00:51:32,883
it would seem
I have the upper hand.

825
00:51:34,515 --> 00:51:36,813
Really, I'm so sorry.

826
00:51:36,858 --> 00:51:39,340
You've done this
too many times to be sorry.

827
00:51:52,416 --> 00:51:55,962
<i>Carlos Guerrero has chosen
to live in a dangerous world.

828
00:51:56,018 --> 00:51:58,182
<i>That's his truth.

829
00:51:58,215 --> 00:51:59,951
<i>My truth is,

830
00:51:59,986 --> 00:52:02,882
<i>that world doesn't need me
to balance its books.

831
00:52:35,155 --> 00:52:40,513
<i>Matt Chambers, welcome to
your last change of address.

832
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:42,351
<i>You'll like it here.

833
00:52:42,388 --> 00:52:45,383
<i>You and your neighbors
have so much in common.

834
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:15,282
<i>The worst thing about finally
putting together a puzzle

835
00:53:15,816 --> 00:53:18,212
<i>is finding
there are missing pieces.

836
00:53:25,416 --> 00:53:28,651
<i>He came back and left nothing
behind but a message -

837
00:53:28,888 --> 00:53:30,651
<i>Come find me.

838
00:53:33,257 --> 00:53:34,882
<i>And I will.

839
00:53:37,246 --> 00:53:39,753
<i>There are no secrets in life,

840
00:53:40,107 --> 00:53:42,303
<i>just hidden truths

841
00:53:42,478 --> 00:53:45,052
<i>that lie beneath the surface.
