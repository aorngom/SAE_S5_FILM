1
00:00:00,129 --> 00:00:01,556
<i>Previously, on Weeds</i>

2
00:00:01,557 --> 00:00:04,348
Well I'm not a candidate because
my name isn't on the fucking ballot.

3
00:00:04,442 --> 00:00:05,445
I won.

4
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:07,272
I fucking won.

5
00:00:07,331 --> 00:00:09,218
I never filed your intent-to-run papers.

6
00:00:10,792 --> 00:00:12,902
People seem to like what we're selling.

7
00:00:13,181 --> 00:00:14,802
This shit is about to getting wild.

8
00:00:14,943 --> 00:00:16,426
Payday.

9
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:17,781
Wait a second.
I don't get paid ?

10
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:20,085
Once you reimburse me for

11
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:22,797
a non refundable year of
rabbinical school.

12
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:24,383
Then you'll be compensated, yeah.

13
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,475
Well, I quit.

14
00:00:25,476 --> 00:00:26,936
All of Agrestic

15
00:00:26,937 --> 00:00:29,676
will become a drug free zone.

16
00:00:29,677 --> 00:00:32,074
I think you're turning Agrestic into
a police state.

17
00:00:34,848 --> 00:00:36,718
That was awesome, Shane.

18
00:00:36,905 --> 00:00:38,346
I'm the new Huskeroos girl.

19
00:00:38,357 --> 00:00:39,569
I could put your money in a trust,

20
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:41,579
but you gonna need at least one parent
to be the signatory.

21
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,507
My dad.

22
00:00:42,508 --> 00:00:43,883
More like that story,

23
00:00:43,884 --> 00:00:46,252
the scorpion and the turtle.

24
00:00:46,253 --> 00:00:47,921
Scorpion and the frog.

25
00:00:47,963 --> 00:00:49,949
I brought you a bean pies Heylia.

26
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,228
Joseph, aren't you lovely.

27
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:55,716
- Heylia James ? You're not gonna have to worry about her.
- What ?

28
00:00:56,062 --> 00:00:58,899
- She's been taken care of.
- There's really no problem with Heylia.

29
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:00,947
You gotta dig the worms to catch the big fish.

30
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:02,582
Heylia's been dig up.

31
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,300
And I don't want to talk about this anymore.

32
00:02:11,752 --> 00:02:13,864
Could you stop doing that ?
It's disgusting.

33
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:15,660
I can't help it, I got GERD.

34
00:02:16,363 --> 00:02:17,182
GERD ?

35
00:02:17,183 --> 00:02:19,593
It's Gastro Oesophageal Reflux Disease.

36
00:02:19,756 --> 00:02:21,551
My stomach acid keeps coming
up the wrong way

37
00:02:21,552 --> 00:02:23,296
and there's not enough left in my stomach so,

38
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,861
it makes me burp.

39
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,080
It's very uncomfortable.

40
00:02:29,084 --> 00:02:30,165
For Chris' sake,

41
00:02:30,596 --> 00:02:31,877
I can't sit here with you another minute.

42
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:33,417
Let's do it.

43
00:02:46,397 --> 00:02:47,490
Federal agents !

44
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:51,654
Get on the floor !
Don't fucking move !

45
00:02:51,703 --> 00:02:53,394
Nobody fucking move !

46
00:03:01,346 --> 00:03:02,365
What the hell is going on ?

47
00:03:02,722 --> 00:03:03,615
(?)

48
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,760
(?) your

49
00:03:04,844 --> 00:03:06,808
vulgarity, in our presence

50
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:09,517
while the (?) underway

51
00:03:10,536 --> 00:03:12,395
This is a house of worship.

52
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:14,936
Where's Heylia James ?

53
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:22,877
We ask that you refrain from
addressing our women directly.

54
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:25,124
When a sister embraces Islam,

55
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,551
it is no longer accustomed
to answer to men who are

56
00:03:28,644 --> 00:03:29,694
unfamiliar.

57
00:03:35,812 --> 00:03:36,836
Search the place.

58
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:40,386
It's a nice bust, Scottson.

59
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,945
- Shit
- You think this is a game ?

60
00:03:49,323 --> 00:03:50,468
Jesus, you scared me.

61
00:03:50,793 --> 00:03:53,199
Did you tell Heylia yourself or
did you have your boy Conrad do it ?

62
00:03:53,388 --> 00:03:54,984
Heylia has always been straight
with me.

63
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:56,612
Just wouldn't listen.

64
00:03:56,969 --> 00:03:57,967
She's a drug dealer.

65
00:03:58,126 --> 00:03:59,134
I'm a drug dealer.

66
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,056
And in order to keep
the heat off of you,

67
00:04:01,077 --> 00:04:02,453
I have to put it on someone else.

68
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:05,804
- I gave you the Armenians.
- I gave YOU the Armenians.

69
00:04:12,715 --> 00:04:15,362
You know this isn't...
this is just not fucking working.

70
00:04:17,253 --> 00:04:18,429
This isn't working.

71
00:04:18,961 --> 00:04:20,524
Scorpion and the turtle.

72
00:04:20,957 --> 00:04:22,047
Frog.

73
00:04:23,044 --> 00:04:26,077
Well at least we have tried, and I think
we both know what needs to happen now.

74
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:30,200
Actually, I have no idea
what needs to happen.

75
00:04:30,672 --> 00:04:31,683
Why don't you tell me ?

76
00:04:31,684 --> 00:04:34,073
- One of us has to quit her job.
- Why me ?

77
00:04:34,912 --> 00:04:36,225
Drug dealer is not a career.

78
00:04:36,357 --> 00:04:38,142
Then why do I make more money than you ?

79
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,729
Nancy, you gotta end this life.

80
00:04:40,887 --> 00:04:42,029
Cause you don't have a choice.

81
00:04:42,608 --> 00:04:44,590
I'm offering you another choice.

82
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:46,021
What choice ?

83
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,194
Marry me, for real.

84
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:51,647
Mail in the marriage certificate.

85
00:04:51,975 --> 00:04:53,065
Tell your kids.

86
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:54,718
Be my wife !

87
00:04:55,152 --> 00:04:56,228
How romantic.

88
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,076
Yeah well, you gonna have to forgive me if

89
00:04:59,077 --> 00:05:00,508
I'm not in the mood to spread

90
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:02,490
rose petals at your feet.

91
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,788
I think you should go.

92
00:05:10,998 --> 00:05:12,416
Well, you have a nice fucking day.

93
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:41,499
Thank you.

94
00:05:42,244 --> 00:05:44,407
The ennemy of my ennemy

95
00:05:45,405 --> 00:05:46,907
is my friend, sister Heylia.

96
00:05:51,094 --> 00:05:52,112
That's a shame.

97
00:05:53,996 --> 00:05:55,004
Yes it is.

98
00:05:55,853 --> 00:05:57,659
You sure look good in white.

99
00:05:59,903 --> 00:06:01,491
Well, all them rules.

100
00:06:01,801 --> 00:06:03,599
Ain't no way I could keep it up for long.

101
00:06:03,816 --> 00:06:04,893
Don't say "ain't".

102
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:07,006
It's a slave word.

103
00:06:08,214 --> 00:06:10,066
I ain't no slave,

104
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:12,664
so I can says what I wants.

105
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,447
A salam aleykoum.

106
00:06:26,251 --> 00:06:27,328
Aleykoum salam.

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,103
You think its possible ?

108
00:06:34,785 --> 00:06:37,699
You think that a black scientist
named Yacub

109
00:06:37,706 --> 00:06:42,137
- created all the white people in a spaceships.
- Could you shut up for ten minutes ?

110
00:06:42,859 --> 00:06:46,247
For ten full minutes, I don't
wanna hear noise.

111
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,136
Almost done yeah.

112
00:06:54,977 --> 00:06:56,408
It's got a 5-inch thick door.

113
00:06:56,486 --> 00:06:57,379
Three-inch walls.

114
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,410
It's got 6 sides of protection against
concentred attacks with mechanical

115
00:07:01,502 --> 00:07:02,973
and electrical tools.

116
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:05,034
We keep our ready-to-sell harvest in here.

117
00:07:05,452 --> 00:07:07,647
Okay as we rotate it out,
we fill the backup.

118
00:07:07,648 --> 00:07:09,131
No cash, no personal items.

119
00:07:09,132 --> 00:07:12,557
You and me are the only people on earth
to know the combinaison.

120
00:07:13,436 --> 00:07:14,736
Right, I'll show you how to set it.

121
00:07:15,064 --> 00:07:16,127
Got five numbers.

122
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:20,092
Left, right, left-right, left.

123
00:07:20,354 --> 00:07:23,769
Four turns in between, you'll hear
a lock click when you're done.

124
00:07:27,537 --> 00:07:28,587
So what is it gonna be ?

125
00:07:29,112 --> 00:07:30,123
What about...

126
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:34,815
6 2 6 2 9

127
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,574
What is that ?

128
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:39,463
It's Nancy, if you spell it (?) the telephone.

129
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:42,101
You think that shit is slick ?

130
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,241
That nobody's gonna figure that out ?

131
00:07:45,489 --> 00:07:48,128
And no kids' birthday either.
People don't(?) just look that up.

132
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:51,226
Okay.

133
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:03,212
- Hi
- Hi

134
00:08:03,724 --> 00:08:04,998
You like me, don't you ?

135
00:08:05,496 --> 00:08:07,531
- Yeah
- You want me to be your girlfriend ?

136
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,814
- Yes
- I'm not gonna kiss you until I get my braces off.

137
00:08:11,168 --> 00:08:12,586
And that won't be for a while.

138
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:14,687
Like, maybe even a year.

139
00:08:15,002 --> 00:08:16,026
It's okay.

140
00:08:16,591 --> 00:08:17,602
Okay then.

141
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:25,073
<i>Huskeroo, Huskeroo</i>

142
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:28,648
<i>You're beautiful in all the things you do</i>

143
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:32,640
<i>And your brand is Huskeroo</i>

144
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,698
<i>Huskeroo, that's you be you</i>

145
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:38,495
<i>Huskeroo, that's you be you</i>

146
00:08:38,705 --> 00:08:39,860
They're just roomier.

147
00:08:41,107 --> 00:08:43,235
- Did you see it?
- At least they got her hair right.

148
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:47,226
So if this thing goes national,
how much money are we talking ?

149
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:50,522
A new dishwasher ? New ... house ?

150
00:08:50,653 --> 00:08:52,045
It's Isabelle's money.

151
00:08:52,806 --> 00:08:55,642
- The law on California clearly states ...
- Yeah yeah yeah

152
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:58,399
So we throw some in a college fund,
but the rest

153
00:08:58,794 --> 00:09:00,201
is fair gain(?), right ?

154
00:09:00,408 --> 00:09:03,376
- After taxes, after we pay Doug and
after my management fee.

155
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:04,623
Okay fine.

156
00:09:04,728 --> 00:09:05,962
Manager..

157
00:09:06,934 --> 00:09:08,654
Can you loan me a few grand ?

158
00:09:08,732 --> 00:09:10,164
- What for ?
- Clothes.

159
00:09:11,109 --> 00:09:12,526
I had my cancer purge,

160
00:09:12,592 --> 00:09:16,281
but now I'm in the public eye,
and I have nothing to wear.

161
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,749
You wanna take Isabelle's hard gained dollars,
and blow them on

162
00:09:19,236 --> 00:09:22,385
Glad rags for your star turn on
Agrestic's access TV.

163
00:09:22,386 --> 00:09:25,813
You bought a motorcycle and
a ridiculous leather jacket.

164
00:09:26,508 --> 00:09:27,519
All right let me think about it.

165
00:09:28,136 --> 00:09:29,173
No.

166
00:09:30,316 --> 00:09:33,945
*Huskaroo huskaroo, you're beautiful in
all the things you do*

167
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:41,205
- You're okay ? You look a little frazzled.
- I'm fine.

168
00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:43,723
Who kicks ass ?

169
00:09:43,776 --> 00:09:45,522
Huh.. I'm guessing you.

170
00:09:45,523 --> 00:09:47,294
I totally kick ass.

171
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,369
What does kicking ass entail ?

172
00:09:49,514 --> 00:09:50,551
A girlfriend.

173
00:09:50,932 --> 00:09:52,022
But that's not all.

174
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,239
Did a free cheese grater come with the girlfriend ?

175
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:56,433
Oh stop that.

176
00:09:56,434 --> 00:09:58,508
I'm gonna be the class speaker for graduation.

177
00:09:59,257 --> 00:10:03,799
- Sweetie, that's fantastic.
- Way to go little man !

178
00:10:04,097 --> 00:10:05,743
The whole (?) school voted.

179
00:10:06,053 --> 00:10:07,869
I'm gonna go start working on my speech.

180
00:10:08,027 --> 00:10:09,970
- Congratulations honey.
- Thanks.

181
00:10:11,702 --> 00:10:12,871
Are we worried...

182
00:10:13,068 --> 00:10:14,092
What ? About what ?

183
00:10:14,617 --> 00:10:16,920
That they're setting him up to laugh at him.

184
00:10:17,163 --> 00:10:18,765
They're laughing with him now.

185
00:10:18,766 --> 00:10:21,680
They think he's cool ever since
he took up your cause.

186
00:10:22,861 --> 00:10:23,886
What cause ?

187
00:10:23,912 --> 00:10:25,303
Go drugs !

188
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:26,997
He doesn't know what I do.

189
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,054
Keep clinging the value raft.

190
00:10:35,846 --> 00:10:37,106
Okay this vote

191
00:10:37,356 --> 00:10:39,616
is on a motion by Walter Straley

192
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,750
to request a variance from
zoning regulation 11.6

193
00:10:44,091 --> 00:10:46,113
for a front yard set back.

194
00:10:46,454 --> 00:10:48,463
- All in favor..
- Try 11.2

195
00:10:50,892 --> 00:10:53,623
- Excuse me ?
- It's zoning regulation 11.2

196
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,844
not 6.

197
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:57,273
And Walt is not adding a family room.

198
00:10:58,271 --> 00:11:00,069
He's adding a giant garage for his boat,

199
00:11:00,378 --> 00:11:02,742
which is gonna cut off all the light
to his neighbour's dining room.

200
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:04,251
Read the plans.

201
00:11:04,803 --> 00:11:08,099
Family room doesn't have concrete floors
and a door that's operated by a remote.

202
00:11:08,164 --> 00:11:09,162
That's complete bullshit.

203
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,459
You're not in charge here anymore, Wilson.

204
00:11:11,551 --> 00:11:13,940
Lucky for you. I'd already thrown
your nautical ass (?) out of here.

205
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:17,393
Really. Why are you fucking (?) ?

206
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:19,849
Excuse me.

207
00:11:20,196 --> 00:11:21,162
You (?).

208
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:25,810
Now, all those in favor of granting the motion,

209
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:27,911
raise your hand and say aye.

210
00:11:28,658 --> 00:11:29,669
Aye.

211
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:36,103
All of those against, ney.

212
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,770
Ney.

213
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:39,070
Motion is denied.

214
00:11:39,456 --> 00:11:40,882
Fuck you Wilson !

215
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:42,549
Go play with your dinghy.

216
00:11:43,678 --> 00:11:46,395
Please just turn those lights down a little.

217
00:11:46,396 --> 00:11:48,194
Oh you need them for the public access' cameras.

218
00:11:48,851 --> 00:11:50,203
I know, it's unfortunate.

219
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:51,700
Nobody looks good in High Def.

220
00:11:51,988 --> 00:11:55,428
You know, if you would like to address
this council as a citizen,

221
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:57,476
you can go ahead, and wait at the end of...

222
00:11:57,477 --> 00:12:00,155
Could you stop with the fucking spotlight !

223
00:12:00,156 --> 00:12:03,227
Ceylia, check the language at the door(?)
Families are watching.

224
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:07,560
You know. I know what you're trying to do,

225
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:10,737
I know what you're all trying to do,
and it's not gonna work.

226
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:15,582
I don't need you to like me.

227
00:12:16,023 --> 00:12:17,263
How about we put this to a vote ?

228
00:12:18,156 --> 00:12:20,319
All those who don't like Ceylia, say aye.

229
00:12:20,634 --> 00:12:22,115
Aye.

230
00:12:22,944 --> 00:12:24,047
Public has spoken.

231
00:12:31,547 --> 00:12:32,566
Damn it.

232
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,042
Saturday is dad's birthday, you know.

233
00:12:41,746 --> 00:12:42,765
I know.

234
00:12:44,183 --> 00:12:45,769
Well, we have a lot to do to get ready.

235
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:51,340
Maybe we'll (?) that on the (?) this year.
Last year was kind of a ..

236
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:52,692
What did you guys do last year ?

237
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:55,147
Ate his favorite foods,
watched his favorite movies and,

238
00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:57,209
Beat the shit out of piñata.

239
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,152
That's right.

240
00:12:59,217 --> 00:13:01,318
He always did have a thing for piñatas.

241
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,154
Did he ever hit you, Nancy ?

242
00:13:04,508 --> 00:13:05,769
I'm not filled with candy.

243
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,762
So what's the plan ?

244
00:13:09,131 --> 00:13:10,220
We'll do something.

245
00:13:10,221 --> 00:13:13,121
Maybe just not the
full-on all-day celebration.

246
00:13:13,371 --> 00:13:15,235
Why can't we just do what we did last year ?

247
00:13:18,071 --> 00:13:19,397
I'm not sure I can handle it.

248
00:13:21,483 --> 00:13:22,507
Okay.

249
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:25,842
Hey hey hey. How abo.. how about
a mini celebration ?

250
00:13:26,236 --> 00:13:29,366
All right, huh, would you keep it simple,
just the things that Judah loves.

251
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:34,394
Chicken parmesan, Willy Wonka, the original.
Not the lame Johnny Depp piece of shit.

252
00:13:35,432 --> 00:13:36,601
Piñata.

253
00:13:36,798 --> 00:13:37,861
Lap dance.

254
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,054
Ceylia.

255
00:13:54,088 --> 00:13:55,152
Hey hey, take it easy !

256
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,594
- All right
- God, I never should have done it.

257
00:13:57,804 --> 00:13:59,970
They hate me.
They hate me !

258
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:01,467
This is all your fault.

259
00:14:01,688 --> 00:14:04,868
Could(?) have you just put a fucking lighting
at the intersection.

260
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,270
- I was going to !
- Oh right, you were.

261
00:14:07,323 --> 00:14:10,658
But you were being this know-it-all
bitch face, I couldn't resist fucking with you.

262
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:12,168
Yeah, and you still can't.

263
00:14:12,365 --> 00:14:14,544
City council was pretty much
the only thing in my life

264
00:14:14,545 --> 00:14:16,697
I didn't have to get bait to get through.

265
00:14:17,564 --> 00:14:18,745
You took that away from me.

266
00:14:22,868 --> 00:14:25,468
How did you know about Walter's
boat garage ?

267
00:14:26,885 --> 00:14:27,804
Ceylia..

268
00:14:27,883 --> 00:14:30,969
Everything that happens in governement
is motivated by self-altruist(?).

269
00:14:31,573 --> 00:14:34,868
Someone is always trying to poop one over
on someone else so they can get something they want.

270
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,407
(?) is not but a bunch of selfish assholes.

271
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:39,989
Remember that.

272
00:14:40,576 --> 00:14:41,587
And you won't go wrong.

273
00:14:44,357 --> 00:14:45,381
Thank you.

274
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:55,700
Ceylia.

275
00:14:57,621 --> 00:14:59,134
You should bring some vodka to the council.

276
00:15:00,847 --> 00:15:01,792
Vodka ?

277
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:02,674
It's what I used to do.

278
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:04,155
You think they like anyone ?

279
00:15:04,954 --> 00:15:05,962
They like a good buzz.

280
00:15:07,233 --> 00:15:08,630
You're just trying to set me up.

281
00:15:09,751 --> 00:15:10,810
Why would I do that ?

282
00:15:11,131 --> 00:15:12,684
Cause you wanna see me fail.

283
00:15:14,187 --> 00:15:16,380
I mean, why else would you come here tonight ?

284
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:18,523
I just had nothing else to do.

285
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,198
Voda huh.

286
00:15:22,343 --> 00:15:23,421
(?)

287
00:15:45,141 --> 00:15:46,317
Go take the kids shopping.

288
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,788
Get supplies for Judah fest.

289
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:49,082
Yeah, I can do that.

290
00:15:49,897 --> 00:15:53,599
With money for both provisions and
my services as a nanny.

291
00:15:53,993 --> 00:15:56,750
Slash assistant.

292
00:15:59,206 --> 00:16:00,676
Oh that's how it's gonna be.

293
00:16:01,582 --> 00:16:03,158
According to my calculations,

294
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:08,285
I will have fully repaid my debt to you as of

295
00:16:08,363 --> 00:16:10,267
my next excursion to the dry-cleaner.

296
00:16:10,268 --> 00:16:11,882
I'd like to double check those numbers.

297
00:16:11,883 --> 00:16:14,180
- If you don't mind.
- They're rough estimates, really. They're.. they're..

298
00:16:14,534 --> 00:16:15,637
more projections.

299
00:16:16,635 --> 00:16:17,869
Taking inflation into account.

300
00:16:18,695 --> 00:16:20,782
I found another bill today from your old

301
00:16:20,927 --> 00:16:24,117
*Hamemader Amrash lev vava va*

302
00:16:24,602 --> 00:16:26,336
Over $5,000.

303
00:16:26,337 --> 00:16:28,318
Hamidrash LaTorah

304
00:16:28,384 --> 00:16:30,196
And happy is it is tax deductable.

305
00:16:30,275 --> 00:16:31,850
I don't pay taxes, you idiot.

306
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,119
There's a big harvest coming up
in a couple of weeks.

307
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:36,721
Why don't you come back and help ?

308
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,834
I'll put you on the payroll.

309
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:41,986
I want more than Sanjay.

310
00:16:41,987 --> 00:16:43,036
Forget it.

311
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,113
Wait wait wait.

312
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,211
- Yeah I'll take it.
- Welcome back.

313
00:16:53,185 --> 00:16:54,682
Jelly Beans for the piñata.

314
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:57,084
Dad hated Jelly Beans.

315
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,370
I like the cherry ones.

316
00:16:58,633 --> 00:17:01,725
- He said they taste like cough syrup.
- The only candy your father really liked

317
00:17:01,732 --> 00:17:03,825
is Almond Joy, don't ask me why.

318
00:17:03,826 --> 00:17:05,335
But get what you, get what you want.

319
00:17:05,336 --> 00:17:06,438
Not if dad hated them.

320
00:17:10,008 --> 00:17:11,295
Yael.

321
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:17,714
How was that like before you met mom ?

322
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:19,487
Ah he didn't smell as good.

323
00:17:19,626 --> 00:17:21,591
But he was the golden boy.

324
00:17:22,712 --> 00:17:23,792
My black sheep.

325
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:26,506
He did everything right.
A mother's dream. Hard working,

326
00:17:26,554 --> 00:17:28,680
athletic, ambitious.

327
00:17:29,401 --> 00:17:30,714
That wasn't getting him laid,

328
00:17:30,774 --> 00:17:32,773
so he went to a (?)

329
00:17:33,388 --> 00:17:34,590
Where is his painting ?

330
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:36,013
No no no that kind of artists.

331
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,426
Performance artists.

332
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:40,957
He did weird stuff like
paint his whole body in silver and

333
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:44,707
stand naked on a (?)

334
00:17:44,843 --> 00:17:45,705
Why ?

335
00:17:45,706 --> 00:17:47,847
To get laid. It worked too.
He met your mom.

336
00:17:47,961 --> 00:17:49,439
When he (?) the dance barefoot

337
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:53,102
in his "feet me" in St-Louis installation

338
00:17:53,777 --> 00:17:54,809
But he was always broke.

339
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,667
It wasn't really his true nature and
your mom wanted kids so

340
00:18:00,683 --> 00:18:02,530
he took his engineering degree, got a real job,

341
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,434
moved to suburbans.

342
00:18:06,073 --> 00:18:07,661
I'm never getting married, it's death.

343
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:11,561
You're a little young to
have reached to that conclusion.

344
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,543
How come you're not married uncle Andy ?

345
00:18:13,544 --> 00:18:14,580
Cause it's death.

346
00:18:14,738 --> 00:18:15,762
Right here, here we go.

347
00:18:24,035 --> 00:18:27,942
So, Alan Robert's brother

348
00:18:28,572 --> 00:18:30,441
owns green glass landscaping(?).

349
00:18:30,638 --> 00:18:33,981
Oh yeah, she gave him a no bit contract
to maintain all the parks and

350
00:18:33,986 --> 00:18:36,437
and the medians the minute she got elected.

351
00:18:37,151 --> 00:18:38,839
He overcharges like Hella Burton.

352
00:18:39,168 --> 00:18:42,936
But, you gotta love the flowering jack
around trees he put up by the ball fields.

353
00:18:43,126 --> 00:18:45,903
And Tom Bender owns all of our school buses.

354
00:18:46,014 --> 00:18:49,093
Bought them from the town and then rent them
back to us for twice what he paid.

355
00:18:49,476 --> 00:18:50,884
Which was actually my idea,

356
00:18:51,104 --> 00:18:52,302
but he went behind my back,

357
00:18:52,487 --> 00:18:55,274
made the deal himself on Diana (?)

358
00:18:55,484 --> 00:18:56,426
Where did she stay ?

359
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,053
Four seasons, Maui.

360
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,316
See I prefer the (?).

361
00:19:00,403 --> 00:19:01,309
Me too.

362
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,053
But Dana like some (?)
pancakes at the Four Seasons.

363
00:19:04,355 --> 00:19:07,112
$28 for fucking crunchy pancakes.

364
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:08,753
They should take two bites (?)

365
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,012
- You want another (?)
- No,

366
00:19:11,013 --> 00:19:14,155
no, I should probably save that
for the next council meeting.

367
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:15,770
Oh right, it's your vodka.

368
00:19:16,465 --> 00:19:18,658
Well. Thank you for this.

369
00:19:19,643 --> 00:19:20,917
The 411.

370
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:25,433
I never realized there were such a method
to your madness.

371
00:19:25,545 --> 00:19:27,468
Six years on the job and you
learn how things work.

372
00:19:29,937 --> 00:19:32,090
Are you heading out too ?

373
00:19:32,195 --> 00:19:33,600
- Me ?
- Are you leaving ?

374
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,543
- No
- Should we go out together ?

375
00:19:35,793 --> 00:19:37,762
- What ?
- Not "should we go out together",

376
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:39,692
just should we go out, together,

377
00:19:40,322 --> 00:19:41,925
out of this office,

378
00:19:42,108 --> 00:19:43,198
outside.

379
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,485
Well,

380
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:47,111
it is lunch time, out there.

381
00:19:48,306 --> 00:19:52,599
Wanna try this new little Mongolian barbecue place
before they go out of business.

382
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,499
What was that ?

383
00:20:02,564 --> 00:20:03,864
I don't know.

384
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,766
- I have condoms on my desk.
- Do you have herpes ? Warts ? Anything ?

385
00:20:18,858 --> 00:20:20,459
- I'm clean, you ?
- I'm clean.

386
00:20:21,256 --> 00:20:22,678
I had my tubes tight (?)

387
00:20:23,046 --> 00:20:24,831
- Fuck the condoms.
- Courageous.

388
00:20:36,187 --> 00:20:39,272
This isn't awesome scheme to get back
control of Isabelle's money, is it ?

389
00:20:39,716 --> 00:20:42,515
This isn't some hostile way to get back
at Dean, is it ?

390
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:43,893
I'm not sure what it is.

391
00:20:44,064 --> 00:20:45,048
Me neither.

392
00:20:45,205 --> 00:20:47,110
- (?) care right now.
- Me either.

393
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,479
My cousin live in a village where

394
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,893
all the babies born 1 year look like
those humpa lumpas.

395
00:20:56,168 --> 00:20:57,941
Then they stopped to crop those thing.

396
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,174
And the next year.

397
00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:00,684
all fine.

398
00:21:00,724 --> 00:21:03,218
Do they dance and sing morality songs ?

399
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:06,448
No, but a lot of them (?) bars
to make a living.

400
00:21:06,841 --> 00:21:09,257
I used to have nightmares about the boat scene.

401
00:21:09,637 --> 00:21:10,793
I remember that.

402
00:21:10,794 --> 00:21:14,902
I used to have to crawl in bed with you
and reads you from the real estate section
to get you to fall asleep.

403
00:21:14,949 --> 00:21:17,568
Which got me into trouble at school

404
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:19,195
when we were studying Roosevelt.

405
00:21:19,274 --> 00:21:22,176
I proudly announced the entire class
that FDR stood for

406
00:21:22,478 --> 00:21:24,211
Formal Dining Room.

407
00:21:24,212 --> 00:21:25,222
Sssh I like this part.

408
00:21:27,513 --> 00:21:29,672
(?) chicken parmesan.

409
00:21:47,918 --> 00:21:49,218
No, oh no.

410
00:21:49,219 --> 00:21:50,295
I promise I won't yell.

411
00:21:50,347 --> 00:21:51,699
No ultimatums.

412
00:21:52,054 --> 00:21:53,144
I just want to talk.

413
00:21:53,944 --> 00:21:54,981
Can I come in ?

414
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,334
Bad timing.

415
00:21:57,003 --> 00:21:58,066
What's going on ?

416
00:21:58,395 --> 00:21:59,432
Mom.

417
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,281
Birthday celebration.

418
00:22:02,924 --> 00:22:03,948
Whose birthday ?

419
00:22:05,589 --> 00:22:07,493
Mom, you're missing the best part.

420
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,999
Guys, Peter's here,

421
00:22:11,222 --> 00:22:15,095
and I need to help him with something outside
just for a minute, then I'll be right back. Ok ?

422
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:17,313
What is he doing here ?

423
00:22:17,642 --> 00:22:19,335
It's dad's birthday for fuck sake.

424
00:22:19,952 --> 00:22:22,525
Dinner's almost ready.
Lupita, set the table.

425
00:22:22,722 --> 00:22:23,799
You have hands.

426
00:22:24,075 --> 00:22:25,755
Do you know he is a DEA agent ?

427
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,630
Who's a DEA agent ?

428
00:22:28,854 --> 00:22:29,904
That Peter guy.

429
00:22:29,983 --> 00:22:31,033
Get the fuck out of here.

430
00:22:31,276 --> 00:22:34,946
I saw him leaving here yesterday and
he had this jacket on that said DEA.

431
00:22:35,489 --> 00:22:37,406
- Shane, stop making shit up.
- I'm not.

432
00:22:37,892 --> 00:22:40,163
DEA could stand for a lot of things.

433
00:22:40,255 --> 00:22:44,142
No. It was the same kind I see them on
the news when they bust people.

434
00:22:44,832 --> 00:22:45,998
The exact kind.

435
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,001
What exactly did he say to your mom ?

436
00:22:49,358 --> 00:22:50,377
I don't know.

437
00:22:50,755 --> 00:22:53,539
When I saw him, he was getting
into his car.

438
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,303
He looked really mad.

439
00:22:56,585 --> 00:22:57,960
He's mom's boyfriend, isn't he ?

440
00:23:02,939 --> 00:23:04,210
I really have to get back.

441
00:23:04,462 --> 00:23:06,184
I didn't mean to interrupt your celebration,
I just...

442
00:23:06,531 --> 00:23:08,014
didn't like the way our last
conversation went.

443
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,776
I was upset.

444
00:23:10,129 --> 00:23:13,377
I know, and you've had the right to be.
I'm sorry I went behind your back.

445
00:23:13,747 --> 00:23:14,760
I wanna be with you.

446
00:23:16,115 --> 00:23:17,033
Get to work through this.

447
00:23:17,283 --> 00:23:18,710
We have weird issues, Peter.

448
00:23:18,928 --> 00:23:19,841
All couples do.

449
00:23:20,153 --> 00:23:22,057
I'm guessing our issues are pretty unique.

450
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:27,833
This is really not the right time to talk.

451
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,120
When is the right time ?

452
00:23:30,394 --> 00:23:32,297
When it's not my dead husband's birthday.

453
00:23:35,186 --> 00:23:36,210
Fair enough.

454
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,875
- I have to get back.
- I'll call you later.

455
00:23:43,777 --> 00:23:44,919
Where is everybody ?

456
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:47,952
After Shane tell Silas that man is in the DEA,

457
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,670
Silas tell Shane he's your boyfriend.

458
00:23:50,906 --> 00:23:52,521
And you don't care about Judah no more.

459
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,963
So he smashed the cake and ran upstairs.

460
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:58,312
And Silas go outside to fuck up
the (?) with a basket-ball.

461
00:23:58,705 --> 00:24:00,334
And Andy go upstairs to get notched(?).

462
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,711
Hide from stress.

463
00:24:16,508 --> 00:24:17,545
Silas.

464
00:24:20,605 --> 00:24:21,668
Silas.

465
00:24:25,252 --> 00:24:26,198
Talk to me.

466
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:28,482
You're insane, he is a fucking DEA agent.

467
00:24:28,613 --> 00:24:30,254
Yes, yes he is.

468
00:24:31,173 --> 00:24:32,224
But it's okay.

469
00:24:32,841 --> 00:24:33,812
He's okay with it.

470
00:24:34,521 --> 00:24:36,635
So he is a crooked DEA agent. Even better.

471
00:24:37,003 --> 00:24:39,418
Peter protects my business, Silas.

472
00:24:39,537 --> 00:24:41,913
Well maybe now, but what happens
when he breaks up with you.

473
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,500
Or do you think you're so great that
that's never gonna happen.

474
00:24:45,064 --> 00:24:46,587
What happens when he dumps you ?

475
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:47,926
He can't do anything to me.

476
00:24:47,966 --> 00:24:49,896
Bullshit ! He can arrest you.

477
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,199
I'm gonna tell you something,
but you have to promise

478
00:24:55,409 --> 00:24:57,470
never to repeat it, especially to Shane.

479
00:24:57,628 --> 00:24:58,888
- Tell me what.
- Swear to me,

480
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,451
Never to shane.

481
00:25:02,591 --> 00:25:03,878
Peter and I are technically...

482
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:06,530
we're...

483
00:25:07,948 --> 00:25:08,973
What ?

484
00:25:11,034 --> 00:25:12,084
We're married.

485
00:25:15,157 --> 00:25:16,391
I know it sounds crazy,

486
00:25:16,392 --> 00:25:18,780
it kind of is crazy, but sometimes
you do crazy things

487
00:25:18,781 --> 00:25:20,855
when you have no choice,
and I had no choice.

488
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:24,124
It's a business arrangement, pure and simple.

489
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:27,486
I know what you're thinking.

490
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,331
I .. loved

491
00:25:32,777 --> 00:25:33,749
your father.

492
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,850
I still... love him.

493
00:25:36,165 --> 00:25:38,567
This has nothing to do with Judah or

494
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:41,560
marriage, really. It's business.

495
00:25:42,492 --> 00:25:43,503
You m-married him.

496
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:47,612
Silas, I know how strange this all sound.

497
00:25:47,613 --> 00:25:50,185
- It's dad's birthday !
- I know.

498
00:25:50,186 --> 00:25:51,879
But he's dead, so what difference does it make.

499
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:55,305
Stop playing the dead dad card.

500
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,051
The wrong parent died.

501
00:25:57,563 --> 00:25:59,625
And you know what ? Tough shit.

502
00:26:01,349 --> 00:26:04,200
Get your ass back and go watch
Willy fucking Wonka
