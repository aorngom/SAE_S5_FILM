00:00:00,294 --> 00:00:01,894
<i>Previously on</i> Weeds...

2
00:00:02,014 --> 00:00:04,121
We're gonna be doing
some remodeling around here.

3
00:00:04,241 --> 00:00:06,621
We could save money
if we didn't use a contractor.

4
00:00:06,741 --> 00:00:08,428
- I could do it.
- You're hired.

5
00:00:08,588 --> 00:00:11,264
I turn 18 in a few weeks.
I'm not waiting.

6
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:13,475
We should be coyotes.

7
00:00:13,635 --> 00:00:16,478
That guy who brought over
Davenport and Marzipan

8
00:00:16,638 --> 00:00:18,021
was such an asshole.

9
00:00:18,934 --> 00:00:22,025
Why can't you buy your drugs in the U.S.
like a normal person?

10
00:00:22,185 --> 00:00:25,737
I have no health insurance,
no money, and an arrest record.

11
00:00:25,897 --> 00:00:27,489
- Xanax?
- Yes!

12
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:29,157
I want some.

13
00:00:29,317 --> 00:00:30,959
How about I sell you 300 pounds

14
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:32,911
- at 25 bucks a gram?
- Fuck you.

15
00:00:33,071 --> 00:00:36,247
- That's more than street value.
- You don't like it, do something else.

16
00:00:36,407 --> 00:00:38,541
I need to <i>habla</i> with Esteban.

17
00:00:39,636 --> 00:00:43,375
"We are here to inaugurate
this mobile medical unit."

18
00:00:43,665 --> 00:00:46,529
- I want a piece of the next shipment.
- You work for Guillermo.

19
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:48,677
- There's a chain of command.
- But he said no.

20
00:00:48,905 --> 00:00:50,053
I came to you first.

21
00:00:53,608 --> 00:00:54,558
Thanks...

Transcript : Sadgeezer
Synch : Macanto, mpm, Dapitch666

22
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,900
<i>Hola.</i>
Boss says time to start.

23
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:13,119
Boss?

24
00:01:14,487 --> 00:01:15,912
Bubblicious or rhythm field?

25
00:01:16,774 --> 00:01:18,968
I like bubblicious,
but it's on back order,

26
00:01:19,088 --> 00:01:22,711
and rhythm field fell off a truck,
so there may not be enough.

27
00:01:22,985 --> 00:01:26,715
What happened to the solid subway tile
field with hex tiles on the floor?

28
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:29,748
- I want to give you options.
- You're the contractor,

29
00:01:29,868 --> 00:01:32,178
- not the designer.
- I can't express my opinion?

30
00:01:33,285 --> 00:01:35,807
Why don't we discuss this after school?

31
00:01:36,187 --> 00:01:39,102
Surf dicks and gym class.
Can't wait.

32
00:01:39,262 --> 00:01:41,312
It's your first day.
Give it a chance.

33
00:01:41,472 --> 00:01:43,617
A chance for what?
More emotional scarring?

34
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:46,014
I don't see why I have to go to school
if silas doesn't.

35
00:01:46,134 --> 00:01:48,111
You're our one shot at legitimacy.

36
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:51,047
No, I'm not. I'm very corrupt.
I'm a contractor.

37
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:52,923
Shane... stop it.

38
00:01:53,043 --> 00:01:55,243
You're gonna go to school,
and then you'll grow up

39
00:01:55,403 --> 00:01:58,753
and become a doctor or a lawyer
or a business executive.

40
00:02:00,347 --> 00:02:01,947
That's my copper pipe.

41
00:02:04,048 --> 00:02:06,171
You're late.
I hope you have a good excuse.

42
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,744
Is your mother home?

43
00:02:08,864 --> 00:02:11,001
I'm the guy you need to deal with.

44
00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:12,091
Shane,

45
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:14,611
you need to call off your worker bees.

46
00:02:16,827 --> 00:02:17,627
Cesar.

47
00:02:18,444 --> 00:02:19,467
Good morning.

48
00:02:19,587 --> 00:02:22,033
How do you know my pipe guy?
You want to choose tile? Fine.

49
00:02:22,153 --> 00:02:24,503
- But I hire the subs, mom.
- Shane.

50
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:27,484
- Not your pipe guy.
- He would like to see you.

51
00:02:29,471 --> 00:02:31,488
I have to take my kid to school,

52
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,325
and then I have work,
so maybe later on this afternoon?

53
00:02:37,335 --> 00:02:38,135
No?

54
00:02:47,955 --> 00:02:48,755
Great.

55
00:02:48,915 --> 00:02:51,887
I'm being dropped off
in a limo with mexican plates.

56
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:54,257
So much for flying under the radar.

57
00:02:54,867 --> 00:02:56,012
I'm so dead.

58
00:02:57,404 --> 00:02:58,498
New school.

59
00:02:58,926 --> 00:03:00,016
First-day jitters.

60
00:03:00,351 --> 00:03:02,201
Sometimes you eat the bear.

61
00:03:02,809 --> 00:03:05,302
- Sometimes the bear eats you.
- Yeah,

62
00:03:05,422 --> 00:03:08,525
I'll remember that when they're wrapping
the tetherball cord around my neck.

63
00:03:09,538 --> 00:03:12,946
Some people are victims
because they allow themselves to be.

64
00:03:13,106 --> 00:03:14,606
That's right, Shane.

65
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,161
So don't allow it.

66
00:03:16,313 --> 00:03:17,463
Eat the bear.

67
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,380
Here's $10 for lunch
in case you're still hungry after.

68
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,959
Can't I do drug things with you guys?

69
00:03:33,373 --> 00:03:34,968
He's going to get his ass kicked.

70
00:03:36,256 --> 00:03:37,470
He's used to it.

71
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:42,367
Mom.

72
00:03:42,716 --> 00:03:44,310
- Mom!
- Motherfucker!

73
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:47,839
Sorry, baby.

74
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,233
Jail reflex.

75
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:54,320
- You've got to take me to school.
- Isn't there like a bus or something?

76
00:03:54,528 --> 00:03:57,198
For some reason, the cordial suites
La Jolla isn't on their route.

77
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,653
- Just drop me on your way to work.
- Okay.

78
00:04:02,363 --> 00:04:03,163
Okay.

79
00:04:03,997 --> 00:04:05,828
And you've got to change and shower,

80
00:04:05,948 --> 00:04:09,002
and you need to give me $10 for lunch
and to fill out the enrollment forms.

81
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,715
- Hand mommy her pills.
- How about a breakfast bar?

82
00:04:24,018 --> 00:04:26,118
- Maybe I'll walk.
- Good girl.

83
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:48,731
Garza, slow down, slow down.
Plenty of matzo to go around.

84
00:04:49,219 --> 00:04:51,779
This is what my people ate
as we wandered the desert

85
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:53,338
for 40 years...

86
00:04:53,603 --> 00:04:55,048
at least in the beginning.

87
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,841
Then we switched to manna,

88
00:04:57,421 --> 00:04:58,718
which fell from the sky.

89
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,220
Doesn't really happen anymore.

90
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,786
I'm thinking it's either global warming
or god is dead.

91
00:05:03,906 --> 00:05:07,060
I haven't committed either way yet.
So, thoughts?

92
00:05:08,314 --> 00:05:09,395
40 years?

93
00:05:10,164 --> 00:05:11,079
Moses...

94
00:05:12,323 --> 00:05:14,233
wasn't half the coyote I am.

95
00:05:14,393 --> 00:05:16,110
Everybody check their supply bag.

96
00:05:16,431 --> 00:05:18,414
You should all have breath mints,

97
00:05:18,534 --> 00:05:19,784
a portable fan,

98
00:05:20,266 --> 00:05:23,314
and a copy of "<i>padre rico, padre pobre</i>".

99
00:05:23,434 --> 00:05:25,787
If anyone's illiterate,
I have a few copies on tape.

100
00:05:27,219 --> 00:05:30,249
That's a nice tree, huh?
Looks like someone had a fiesta here.

101
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,251
<i>Is violar mata.</i>

102
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:33,589
Rape tree.

103
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,422
These are from girls who have been
under this tree with evil men.

104
00:05:40,393 --> 00:05:42,972
Okay.
Everyone, let's move over there

105
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,473
where the scenery's a little less...
rapey.

106
00:05:52,842 --> 00:05:54,608
Do you guys sell sandwiches?

107
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:55,428
No.

108
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:56,699
Sorry.

109
00:05:58,106 --> 00:06:01,239
People just don't get it. We're
a gourmet shop, not a sandwich shop.

110
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:03,069
What about gourmet sandwiches?

111
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:04,762
I mean, you got your bread,

112
00:06:04,882 --> 00:06:08,478
your meat, every spread on the planet...
just slap them all together,

113
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:10,707
- take out your big knife...
- stab you with it?

114
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:14,657
Shouldn't you be in school?

115
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:17,839
Is money not the goal of this operation?

116
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,924
Big divorce settlement, huh?
Trust fund?

117
00:06:20,084 --> 00:06:23,007
Money is very much
the goal of this operation.

118
00:06:23,127 --> 00:06:25,486
I got screwed
in the divorce settlement,

119
00:06:25,606 --> 00:06:26,556
and no...

120
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:28,989
There is no trust fund.

121
00:06:30,194 --> 00:06:32,854
You might want to think
about making some sandwiches.

122
00:06:34,483 --> 00:06:37,025
You are forbidden to say
the word "sandwich" in my presence.

123
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:39,661
Fine.

124
00:06:41,397 --> 00:06:43,575
Or "sammich". Or "sammy".

125
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,295
It's all unacceptable.

126
00:06:49,151 --> 00:06:51,398
If you're so into gourmet,
why are you smoking this?

127
00:06:51,518 --> 00:06:54,709
- It's like the cheez whiz of pot.
- You're some big expert?

128
00:06:54,869 --> 00:06:58,618
That's a bad blend. It was harvested
probably a year ago and too soon.

129
00:06:58,738 --> 00:07:00,040
It's dried out.

130
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,149
It's full of enough mold to cure strep.

131
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:04,594
I'm thinking
you bought it off one of Rad's friends.

132
00:07:04,754 --> 00:07:06,592
How do you know so much about weed?

133
00:07:06,712 --> 00:07:09,166
Same way you know so much about cheese.

134
00:07:09,488 --> 00:07:12,435
- It's my business.
- I am fucking a teenage drug dealer?

135
00:07:12,595 --> 00:07:13,525
Grower.

136
00:07:13,645 --> 00:07:14,829
Small scale.

137
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:17,273
Soon-to-be dealer.
And we make love.

138
00:07:19,155 --> 00:07:19,942
Do we?

139
00:07:21,328 --> 00:07:22,172
What's

140
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,346
- the greatest cheese ever?
- But are we talking sheep,

141
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:28,015
- goat...
- Yeah.

142
00:07:28,135 --> 00:07:29,290
That cheese.

143
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:31,463
This is better.

144
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:40,241
Oh, my god.

145
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,792
I've been smoking cheez whiz.

146
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:18,700
<i>Entonces, Guillermo.</i>

147
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:23,828
Last week, Nancy received a portion
of your shipment.

148
00:08:23,948 --> 00:08:24,842
<i>¿Verdad?</i>

149
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:25,762
Sí.

150
00:08:25,882 --> 00:08:28,344
I instructed you to give her
that portion, and you did.

151
00:08:29,148 --> 00:08:29,947
Sí.

152
00:08:30,256 --> 00:08:33,423
You gave her that portion,
and then, from what I hear,

153
00:08:33,543 --> 00:08:35,172
you announced that you would kill

154
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:38,192
"the <i>marimacha </i>bitch
in front of her children."

155
00:08:38,755 --> 00:08:41,096
But I didn't instruct you to do that,
did I?

156
00:08:42,464 --> 00:08:44,055
No, I did not.

157
00:08:44,643 --> 00:08:45,778
Now, Guillermo,

158
00:08:46,411 --> 00:08:48,478
you know I don't like to micromanage.

159
00:08:48,598 --> 00:08:51,033
I work with people
who do their jobs well,

160
00:08:52,075 --> 00:08:53,661
and I leave them to do it.

161
00:08:53,821 --> 00:08:54,836
However,

162
00:08:55,187 --> 00:08:58,958
slaughtering a co-worker,
in front of witnesses, no less,

163
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:00,877
has to be cleared with upper management.

164
00:09:01,762 --> 00:09:03,546
And your request is denied.

165
00:09:05,934 --> 00:09:08,303
Julio's just doesn't travel well.

166
00:09:09,145 --> 00:09:12,173
You know, in the restaurant,
this is delicious.

167
00:09:12,951 --> 00:09:16,017
<i>Entonces</i>, Guillermo, nothing bad
is gonna happen to Nancy, right?

168
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:19,967
- Course not.
- I am glad to hear that.

169
00:09:20,087 --> 00:09:22,398
I will increase your commission
for shipments.

170
00:09:22,743 --> 00:09:24,859
You should live to enjoy your money.

171
00:09:26,037 --> 00:09:27,706
- <i>Gracias.</i>
- Good.

172
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,061
Everyone's friends again.

173
00:09:31,126 --> 00:09:32,033
You may go.

174
00:09:35,602 --> 00:09:36,569
Not you.

175
00:09:37,448 --> 00:09:38,289
You stay.

176
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,548
What's a <i>marimacha</i>?

177
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,219
That's an offensive term
for a lesbian woman.

178
00:09:54,002 --> 00:09:55,045
You hungry?

179
00:09:55,165 --> 00:09:57,683
Well, it smells great,
but you just said it didn't travel well.

180
00:09:57,843 --> 00:09:59,518
No, we'll go to the source.

181
00:10:09,563 --> 00:10:11,818
Someone make that noise stop!

182
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,963
<i>Señora</i>, that is three times today.

183
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,085
You're allowing criminals
into our business.

184
00:10:24,245 --> 00:10:26,266
Where's Nancy?
I'm lonely.

185
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,257
You're back there with your gun

186
00:10:29,561 --> 00:10:32,070
and your puzzles, movies...

187
00:10:32,421 --> 00:10:34,046
I've just got the donkey

188
00:10:34,438 --> 00:10:37,270
that plays "pop goes the weasel"
40 million time...

189
00:10:37,831 --> 00:10:39,401
I don't feel good.

190
00:10:40,344 --> 00:10:42,008
<i>¡Señora!
¡Despierte!</i>

191
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:51,394
<i>Señora.</i>

192
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:52,619
<i>Oye.</i>

193
00:10:53,211 --> 00:10:54,374
Breathe in.

194
00:10:56,693 --> 00:10:57,798
Ignacio.

195
00:10:58,748 --> 00:11:00,051
Okay.

196
00:11:00,542 --> 00:11:01,892
Not here, though.

197
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:04,333
<i>¿Que?</i>
No, no.

198
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:06,830
<i>Levàntate</i>. Up. Come on.

199
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:11,132
- What happened?
- You take too many drugs.

200
00:11:11,484 --> 00:11:14,051
You need to keep better care
of this store. Of yourself.

201
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:18,764
- What did you just give me?
- Stay awake.

1
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:23,130
Now your own store.

2
00:11:23,404 --> 00:11:24,104
<i>¿Sí?</i>

3
00:11:24,388 --> 00:11:25,534
I'm on it.

4
00:11:25,746 --> 00:11:27,411
The store is me.

5
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,900
I'm tingly.

6
00:11:33,855 --> 00:11:35,076
Okay, mama.

7
00:11:36,173 --> 00:11:37,843
Let's get you dressed.

8
00:11:49,648 --> 00:11:50,720
Any action?

9
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,131
Nah.

10
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:55,561
I think the word's out,
this is a pretty tough point to cross.

11
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,920
- We're doing good work here.
- Fuck, yeah.

12
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,539
No immigrants storming through
to steal fruit-picking jobs

13
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:02,933
from hardworking americans
on my watch, my friend.

14
00:12:03,094 --> 00:12:05,466
My retarded cousin, Tom,
used to be a janitor.

15
00:12:05,586 --> 00:12:06,473
No more.

16
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:08,330
Mexican took his job.

17
00:12:08,766 --> 00:12:11,916
After he got caught trying
to fuck a mop, but still.

18
00:12:12,635 --> 00:12:15,289
- Shocking. That's just shocking.
- You know that woman I showed you

19
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:17,948
- on my phone the other night?
- Freaky steroid chick?

20
00:12:18,068 --> 00:12:19,909
- She left me.
- Is that good or bad?

21
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,661
She was my masterpiece.

22
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:23,430
Six months of injections...

23
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,399
I took her from 130 to 215
with a BMI of 18.6.

24
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:30,920
She was two weeks away
from an adam's apple.

25
00:12:32,676 --> 00:12:34,131
There'll be others.

26
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:35,468
Not like Hope.

27
00:12:35,962 --> 00:12:38,192
Sometimes, after making love...

28
00:12:38,312 --> 00:12:39,725
she'd dead-lift me.

29
00:12:41,006 --> 00:12:42,556
Now, that's one of a kind.

30
00:12:43,273 --> 00:12:44,121
Anyway.

31
00:12:46,482 --> 00:12:48,479
This is desert eagle,
heading back to H.Q.

32
00:12:53,013 --> 00:12:54,013
Here we go.

33
00:12:56,402 --> 00:12:57,910
I will lead you now.

34
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,116
You shall be a free people!

35
00:13:03,946 --> 00:13:06,021
Good idea.
No time to waste.

36
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,248
Yep.

37
00:13:08,489 --> 00:13:09,984
Lady Liberty Beckons.

38
00:13:14,532 --> 00:13:16,519
This is big and tall,
checkpoint five.

39
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,485
Not a bean on the tortilla.
I repeat, not a bean on the tortilla.

40
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,745
All clear.
No spic, just span.

41
00:13:22,865 --> 00:13:23,638
Over.

42
00:13:35,378 --> 00:13:36,128
<i>Aquí.</i>

43
00:13:37,845 --> 00:13:39,530
<i>Hola!</i>
Welcome to America.

44
00:13:39,691 --> 00:13:41,858
Happy days.
Have you seen this girl?

45
00:13:42,182 --> 00:13:44,034
Anybody?
Nice to have you here.

46
00:13:44,194 --> 00:13:46,454
Have you seen her?
María? <i>¿Sí? ¿No?</i>

47
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:48,385
Nothing?

48
00:13:54,362 --> 00:13:56,006
- We did it, man.
- We sure did.

49
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:56,976
We did.

50
00:14:04,214 --> 00:14:06,191
What do we do with them now?

51
00:14:06,311 --> 00:14:07,338
No idea.

52
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:13,521
So

53
00:14:13,955 --> 00:14:15,191
you are not a lesbian.

54
00:14:16,372 --> 00:14:18,029
Around Guillermo, I am.

55
00:14:19,088 --> 00:14:21,674
Made it easier to be friends...
when we were friends,

56
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:24,200
before he wanted to kill me
in front of my children.

57
00:14:25,246 --> 00:14:26,343
Don't worry.

58
00:14:26,463 --> 00:14:27,545
It is fixed.

59
00:14:34,084 --> 00:14:35,461
You don't need a menu.

60
00:14:36,315 --> 00:14:38,380
You order what you like.
Julio will make it,

61
00:14:38,873 --> 00:14:40,966
and if he can't, he'll find it.

62
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:42,622
Order anything.

63
00:14:42,742 --> 00:14:43,912
- Elk.
- <i>Sí.</i>

64
00:14:44,922 --> 00:14:46,087
Wait, wait.

65
00:14:46,436 --> 00:14:47,682
I'm kidding.

66
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:50,893
Make the best thing that you make.

67
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:52,879
<i>Dos.</i>

68
00:14:54,756 --> 00:14:55,765
Look at you

69
00:14:55,885 --> 00:14:56,899
and your sway.

70
00:14:57,373 --> 00:14:58,083
Yes.

71
00:14:58,581 --> 00:15:01,695
- It's like you're out with the mayor.
- Much like that.

72
00:15:06,223 --> 00:15:07,243
I have to pee.

73
00:15:53,217 --> 00:15:54,123
Holy shit.

74
00:16:05,611 --> 00:16:07,804
Our food might take a little while.

75
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:42,860
- Do you have any neosporin?
- Neosporin?

76
00:16:44,592 --> 00:16:45,751
Twizzlers.

77
00:16:46,387 --> 00:16:49,261
Some tampons.
I might have a tide stick.

78
00:16:49,874 --> 00:16:50,971
Sit.
Sit down.

79
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:53,070
I'm thinking
we should go out for chinese.

80
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:53,930
Sit.

81
00:16:54,403 --> 00:16:55,114
Sit.

82
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:04,104
You never sipped from your beer
after you toasted the crowd.

83
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:07,112
- That's very bad luck.
- I don't like to drink from the bottle.

84
00:17:16,156 --> 00:17:17,153
All right.

85
00:17:18,175 --> 00:17:20,125
But clearly, that's not your issue.

86
00:17:20,881 --> 00:17:21,907
Not my issue.

87
00:17:22,027 --> 00:17:24,511
But then, I have trouble breathing
after I've been shot at,

88
00:17:24,631 --> 00:17:26,681
which, clearly, you don't, so...

89
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,634
I guess we all have our things.

90
00:17:31,428 --> 00:17:33,471
Another school.
Another first day.

91
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:35,557
Another sweaty glass of social stigma.

92
00:17:35,718 --> 00:17:37,559
We're interesting
and worthwhile people.

93
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,786
Well, if only life
were a Judd Apatow movie

94
00:17:40,995 --> 00:17:42,815
where geeks ruled the world.

95
00:17:42,976 --> 00:17:44,226
But it's not, so

96
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:46,151
let's just suck it up.

97
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:48,349
- Chip?
- No, thanks.

98
00:17:49,658 --> 00:17:52,947
Who's the king of the school?
The most popular, most athletic,

99
00:17:53,314 --> 00:17:55,296
most often-laid guy here?

100
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:58,414
I guess it's Dan.
Everyone wants to be friends with Dan.

101
00:18:07,677 --> 00:18:08,799
Hi.
I'm Shane.

102
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,592
Hey. Hi.
I'm Dan.

103
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:15,742
Don't fuck with me.

104
00:18:19,136 --> 00:18:20,577
Medium, large,

105
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,343
large, small, petite...

106
00:18:24,626 --> 00:18:25,976
petite maternity.

107
00:18:27,783 --> 00:18:28,872
Excuse me.

108
00:18:28,992 --> 00:18:29,777
Sorry.

109
00:18:30,325 --> 00:18:31,944
Do you have this in blue?

110
00:18:32,064 --> 00:18:33,287
Nice choice!

111
00:18:34,175 --> 00:18:36,524
I will ring you up over here

112
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:38,411
$42.99...

113
00:18:39,103 --> 00:18:41,457
Do you want it in a box?
In a bag? In a box in a bag?

114
00:18:42,847 --> 00:18:44,552
I actually just want it in blue.

115
00:18:44,672 --> 00:18:46,417
Well, why didn't you say so?

116
00:18:47,351 --> 00:18:49,715
I'm sorry.
I've already checked the racks.

117
00:18:49,876 --> 00:18:52,384
- Can you just check, please?
- Good idea.

118
00:18:58,118 --> 00:18:59,868
Soccer shoe.
Soccer shoe.

119
00:19:00,884 --> 00:19:03,576
- The preggies keep coming.
- We call it <i>fútbol</i>.

120
00:19:13,597 --> 00:19:15,092
- So?
- So, what?

121
00:19:16,251 --> 00:19:17,618
Do you have it in blue?

122
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:19,383
Just get it in green.

123
00:19:20,654 --> 00:19:22,087
Come on.
Come on.

124
00:19:22,797 --> 00:19:24,940
Come on.
Green is the color

125
00:19:25,168 --> 00:19:27,050
of spring, who's next?

126
00:19:27,598 --> 00:19:28,632
Let's go!

127
00:19:30,082 --> 00:19:32,172
You think maybe
they want to close up?

128
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:33,887
We've been here a while.

129
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,842
When I finish my coffee,
we'll go.

130
00:19:36,962 --> 00:19:39,043
Who was trying to kill you?

131
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,117
Maybe the MZO.

132
00:19:47,535 --> 00:19:49,441
Maybe the Mexicate.

133
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,304
And let me guess.
You're the hot sauce.

134
00:19:53,424 --> 00:19:54,863
I am the table.

135
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:01,745
- How often do people shoot at you?
- They mostly shoot at each other.

136
00:20:01,905 --> 00:20:04,832
- And the occasional bystander?
- I cannot control the streets.

137
00:20:04,993 --> 00:20:08,669
Streets that provide
the latest in mobile healthcare.

138
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:12,012
My success in business allows me to

139
00:20:12,236 --> 00:20:13,924
give back to the community.

140
00:20:14,085 --> 00:20:16,468
Take a little blood,
give a little blood.

141
00:20:16,903 --> 00:20:18,473
You question my motives?

142
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:20,193
Soothing your conscience

143
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,141
at the expense of others.

144
00:20:22,261 --> 00:20:24,226
You question my motives.

145
00:20:24,511 --> 00:20:26,395
You're bleeding again.
It's your...

146
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:28,822
No, no.
I'm okay.

147
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:42,322
Maybe if you put it under your pillow

148
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:44,956
you can get a dollar
from the shrapnel fairy.

149
00:20:47,107 --> 00:20:48,957
Well, it's part of the job.

150
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,587
If people see you're afraid,

151
00:20:51,998 --> 00:20:53,672
they do not vote for you.

152
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,333
Nothing scares you?

153
00:20:55,557 --> 00:20:56,845
- Nothing.
- That's a lie.

154
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:59,059
You're afraid of dirty beer bottles.

155
00:21:00,073 --> 00:21:01,300
I'm not afraid.

156
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,181
- I just don't like them.
- Snakes?

157
00:21:03,739 --> 00:21:05,023
Fine with snakes.

158
00:21:05,143 --> 00:21:06,560
- Failure?
- Not a problem.

159
00:21:07,402 --> 00:21:08,402
Heights.

160
00:21:10,418 --> 00:21:12,206
Are you afraid of heights?

161
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,451
Yeah.

162
00:21:21,052 --> 00:21:22,326
What are you afraid of?

163
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,293
Calm.

164
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,701
Before the storm?

165
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,280
The storm I can weather.

166
00:21:41,372 --> 00:21:42,556
Come with me.

167
00:21:49,371 --> 00:21:50,107
Okay.

168
00:21:50,331 --> 00:21:51,683
<i>Adiós, adiós,</i>

169
00:22:01,088 --> 00:22:03,038
You sure you're gonna be okay?

170
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,523
Lake Davenport,

171
00:22:05,997 --> 00:22:06,969
Florida.

172
00:22:08,389 --> 00:22:09,448
Big fish.

173
00:22:10,221 --> 00:22:11,271
Lobster boy.

174
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:12,582
Jeb Bush.

175
00:22:16,315 --> 00:22:17,554
We'll miss you.

176
00:22:21,796 --> 00:22:22,681
<i>Adiós.</i>

177
00:22:23,678 --> 00:22:24,887
<i>Hasta luego.</i>

178
00:22:29,074 --> 00:22:30,831
You were right.
This is a great business.

179
00:22:30,951 --> 00:22:32,605
Helping the unfortunate.

180
00:22:32,725 --> 00:22:35,441
- Unlimited customer base.
- Reconnecting families.

181
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:36,666
Low overhead.

182
00:22:36,786 --> 00:22:38,556
We're doing God's work,

183
00:22:38,676 --> 00:22:41,321
and we're providing the backbone
of the american economy.

184
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:45,151
They paid you, right?

185
00:22:55,783 --> 00:22:57,004
Soccer shoe.

186
00:22:57,346 --> 00:22:58,350
Football shoe.

187
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:01,059
- Whatever you call it, I need more.
- <i>No mas.</i>

188
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:02,039
Please!

189
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,635
Just a little bit?
Helps me.

190
00:23:03,933 --> 00:23:04,755
<i>No mas!</i>

191
00:23:06,842 --> 00:23:08,001
I'll pay you.

192
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:11,134
How much you got?

193
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,738
Hang on.
I'll get my purse.

194
00:23:30,927 --> 00:23:33,053
- I had a thought.
- Oh, yeah?

1
00:23:33,472 --> 00:23:34,583
About cheese.

2
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,209
Surprise.

3
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:40,088
About how it smells very strong.

4
00:23:40,442 --> 00:23:43,801
That is an understatement. You can smell
this place from a block away.

5
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:44,914
It stinks.

6
00:23:46,061 --> 00:23:47,359
Good thing you're sexy.

7
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:50,057
- Okay. You're missing the point.
- What's the point?

8
00:23:50,217 --> 00:23:53,185
It's the kind of smell that
overpowers all other smells.

9
00:23:56,641 --> 00:23:57,606
It is, isn't it?

10
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:06,099
Look at all of this room back here.

11
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,963
Maybe you know somebody
who wants to rent it?

12
00:24:14,274 --> 00:24:17,317
You really don't want
to make sandwiches, do you?

13
00:24:18,907 --> 00:24:20,670
Sandwiches are bullshit.

14
00:24:31,883 --> 00:24:33,767
There are only 40 of them
left in the world.

15
00:24:35,406 --> 00:24:36,934
And now I own three.

16
00:24:38,187 --> 00:24:41,024
He will join the other two
at my zoo in Coyoacàn.

17
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:43,318
My son has turtles.

18
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:52,905
Please tell me that's
also going to your zoo.

19
00:24:53,524 --> 00:24:54,996
You might not want to watch this.

20
00:24:58,201 --> 00:25:00,610
But you don't have a problem with it?

21
00:25:00,979 --> 00:25:02,054
I enjoy it.

22
00:25:12,757 --> 00:25:14,370
<i>Well, teach me, baby,</i>

23
00:25:16,634 --> 00:25:18,895
<i>oh, oh oh, yes</i>

24
00:25:20,962 --> 00:25:22,977
<i>a little show-and-tell.</i>

25
00:25:26,341 --> 00:25:27,535
<i>Teach me, baby,</i>

26
00:25:29,802 --> 00:25:33,109
<i>well one more time.</i>

27
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:38,346
<i>How to see the sunrise,</i>

28
00:25:40,267 --> 00:25:41,797
<i>in the dead of night.</i>

29
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:44,917
<i>Teach me, baby</i>

30
00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:52,941
<i>How to keep from loving you...</i>

31
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,439
<i>Buenas noches,</i> Nancy.

32
00:27:13,305 --> 00:27:17,343
<i>I'm not a weak girl don't call me weak,</i>

33
00:27:17,617 --> 00:27:21,701
<i>no, I'm just a hungry girl</i>

34
00:27:22,145 --> 00:27:24,485
<i>and you taste so sweet</i>

35
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:29,882
<i>and you taste so sweet...</i>
