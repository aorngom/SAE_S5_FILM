<i>Previously on</i> Weeds...

2
00:00:07,587 --> 00:00:09,095
Am I under arrest?

3
00:00:09,255 --> 00:00:11,765
You'll have to get me naked
to know for sure.

4
00:00:11,925 --> 00:00:14,434
Are you trying to flirt with me?

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,061
That's pathetic.

6
00:00:16,221 --> 00:00:19,467
- I want to try living with Mom.
- You're throwing me over for the beach?

7
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:21,346
Location, location, location.

8
00:00:21,684 --> 00:00:23,699
Judah showed me naked pictures of you.

9
00:00:23,819 --> 00:00:26,696
You had this silver sequined bowler hat.

10
00:00:26,856 --> 00:00:29,074
He swore he'd destroy those.

11
00:00:29,234 --> 00:00:30,929
- This is Lisa.
- My Mom.

12
00:00:31,049 --> 00:00:33,460
- Do you want to take a walk?
- Yes. Yeah.

13
00:00:33,905 --> 00:00:34,871
Let's go.

14
00:00:35,363 --> 00:00:36,081
Nice.

15
00:00:37,255 --> 00:00:39,793
- Check out sexy.
- She entered this country illegally.

16
00:00:40,295 --> 00:00:43,129
We could bring her back here
if we were coyotes.

17
00:00:43,414 --> 00:00:44,298
I'm in.

18
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,969
Nancy Botwin.

19
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:51,763
You have four outstanding
parking tickets

20
00:00:51,923 --> 00:00:55,266
and a strange tattoo
on the upper-left cheek

21
00:00:55,532 --> 00:00:57,048
of your backside.

22
00:00:57,345 --> 00:00:59,688
You should not be asking questions...

23
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:01,952
Questions about me.

24
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,103
You must be punished...

25
00:01:06,855 --> 00:01:08,643

Yes I can

Synch: Macanto, mpm, Dapitch666

27
00:01:30,584 --> 00:01:31,681
Fuck, Andy.

28
00:01:31,929 --> 00:01:33,576
You snooze, you lose!

29
00:01:39,998 --> 00:01:41,646
You need to move out of my house.

30
00:01:43,238 --> 00:01:45,316
Hey, Nance. What time is it?

31
00:01:45,476 --> 00:01:47,527
Time for you to get
the fuck out of my house!

32
00:01:49,344 --> 00:01:51,055
You sound really angry.

33
00:01:52,722 --> 00:01:53,992
Do you need sex?

34
00:01:54,345 --> 00:01:55,611
Help you relax.

35
00:01:56,846 --> 00:02:00,833
'Cause I am willing to whip out
my Jeremy Piven right now

36
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:02,743
and give you what you need.

37
00:02:03,467 --> 00:02:05,044
That's how much I care.

38
00:02:08,607 --> 00:02:11,551
The red bra you got hanging
in the shower is totally hot.

39
00:02:12,135 --> 00:02:14,618
Jesus. This is a frat house.

40
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,556
I'm living in a frat house.

41
00:02:17,782 --> 00:02:19,199
Who buys dishes?

42
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:22,182
Well, people collect dishes, corks,

43
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,189
old gynecological instruments.

44
00:02:25,154 --> 00:02:27,692
Mom, why are you googling
the Mayor of Tijuana?

45
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,188
- What?
- The history menu.

46
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:33,277
It's sandwiched between
caffeine side effects

47
00:02:33,397 --> 00:02:36,236
and the Ren Mar unified school district.

48
00:02:36,817 --> 00:02:38,203
It doesn't feel like Silas.

49
00:02:38,363 --> 00:02:40,580
It's important to know
our neighbors to the south.

50
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,375
Speaking of which, where's Davenport?
I want to ask him if he can drywall.

51
00:02:44,535 --> 00:02:46,753
We're gonna be doing
some remodeling around here.

52
00:02:46,913 --> 00:02:49,534
Thank god! I need my own room.

53
00:02:50,016 --> 00:02:52,119
I can't handle the nightly
earthquakes anymore.

54
00:02:52,355 --> 00:02:53,259
Earthquakes?

55
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:55,250
I was scratching. I think there's fleas.

56
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,513
I swear to God.

57
00:02:56,673 --> 00:02:58,598
Perv, we're in a bunk bed.

58
00:02:58,924 --> 00:03:02,060
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Hey, it's a family tradition.

59
00:03:02,551 --> 00:03:04,257
Okay, Delta Pledges,

60
00:03:04,788 --> 00:03:07,190
stop embarrassing your fellow brethren.

61
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,527
And, freshman, find somewhere else
to scratch your fleas.

62
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:13,390
I say we tear the whole place
down and start from scratch.

63
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,157
Yeah. You would.
Like all those tasteless assholes

64
00:03:16,785 --> 00:03:18,104
up and down the block

65
00:03:18,224 --> 00:03:20,683
who replace charming beach cottages

66
00:03:20,803 --> 00:03:22,309
with monstrous boxes...

67
00:03:22,429 --> 00:03:23,600
"We need more room!"

68
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,959
Then work with what you have
or fucking move!

69
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,961
I'm just asking for a second bathroom.

70
00:03:28,883 --> 00:03:29,587
Okay.

71
00:03:30,025 --> 00:03:31,829
You feeling flush?
Bathrooms are expensive.

72
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:33,391
And I need a long tub.

73
00:03:33,511 --> 00:03:36,761
We could save money if we didn't use
a contractor. I could do it.

74
00:03:37,371 --> 00:03:40,597
- It's a big job, sweetie.
- I'm cheap, and I don't ask questions.

75
00:03:41,018 --> 00:03:41,975
You're hired.

76
00:03:42,442 --> 00:03:45,103
You realize it's not our house
to remodel... It's Lenny's.

77
00:03:45,263 --> 00:03:47,341
I want my own fucking bathroom!

78
00:03:47,552 --> 00:03:50,316
What are you complaining about?
We got Celia out of here.

79
00:03:50,476 --> 00:03:52,110
You! Boys!

80
00:03:52,477 --> 00:03:54,279
Boys are disgusting.

81
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:57,991
Okay, let's settle down.
You got that kind of cash around?

82
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:04,021
Gonna explore some opportunities.

83
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,667
Oh, my God. He's huge.

84
00:04:09,474 --> 00:04:13,173
- Two weeks old?
- Gigantism runs in Clinique's family.

85
00:04:13,663 --> 00:04:14,799
Of course it does.

86
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:15,909
God.

87
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,552
- C-section?
- Nope.

88
00:04:17,712 --> 00:04:20,638
Shot out like a Pez.
Got a great pelvis.

89
00:04:21,016 --> 00:04:22,515
That's what everybody say.

90
00:04:26,606 --> 00:04:29,189
Business. How much of the Valley
do you think you could cover?

91
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:31,816
I might be coming into
some bulk product.

92
00:04:32,142 --> 00:04:34,068
100 pounds would be gone in a week.

93
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:36,696
- Seriously?
- You left a vacuum, Nancy.

94
00:04:36,961 --> 00:04:40,233
People are sad. Things are burned.
They need their weed.

95
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:41,900
Okay. Good.

96
00:04:42,563 --> 00:04:43,913
Very good to know.

97
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:46,372
God, he's... he's huge.

98
00:04:46,532 --> 00:04:50,328
Yeah, tell me about it.
Goodbye, Miata. Hello, minivan.

99
00:04:50,448 --> 00:04:52,669
Fuck your Miata with a strap-on,
little bitch.

100
00:04:52,789 --> 00:04:56,007
We getting a Escalade.
Let's do this shit.

101
00:04:57,543 --> 00:05:00,384
I have health insurance now
and a guesthouse.

102
00:05:01,005 --> 00:05:03,846
But the man, Mr. Caplan,
he don't wipe so good.

103
00:05:03,966 --> 00:05:06,559
Always leaving shit slicks everywhere...

104
00:05:07,018 --> 00:05:10,605
In the underwear,
on the toilet seat, the sheets.

105
00:05:10,725 --> 00:05:12,572
I don't know how she live with him.

106
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:14,192
You want to sell drugs?

107
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:16,402
I have to leave my guesthouse?

108
00:05:16,562 --> 00:05:18,238
I like living in Beverly Hills.

109
00:05:18,523 --> 00:05:20,990
- He's an agent.
- Sell to his agent friends.

110
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,261
They like to party

111
00:05:22,381 --> 00:05:24,786
with all the money they've made
off of other people's work.

112
00:05:24,964 --> 00:05:27,131
Yes, they love to party.

113
00:05:28,048 --> 00:05:30,416
You have cocaine? They like that, too.

114
00:05:30,977 --> 00:05:33,000
No. No cocaine. Just pot.

115
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,421
You should really think
about the cocaine, Nancy.

116
00:05:35,581 --> 00:05:37,215
- No.
- And the ecstasy.

117
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:41,469
- No.
- Okay. I get that from Geffen's maid.

118
00:05:52,272 --> 00:05:56,196
- What? Why are you looking at me funny?
- 'Cause you ain't said nothin'.

119
00:05:56,538 --> 00:05:58,778
Haven't you noticed
something different about me?

120
00:06:01,465 --> 00:06:02,863
I lost 10 pounds!

121
00:06:04,486 --> 00:06:07,120
Oh. Right! Of course you did!

122
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:11,791
- Good for you! You look terrific.
- Thanks.

123
00:06:11,951 --> 00:06:13,459
Feels good. You know,

124
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,337
finally back to my high school weight.

125
00:06:16,497 --> 00:06:17,833
You should be so proud,

126
00:06:17,953 --> 00:06:21,634
and I bet the women
are beating down your door.

127
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,607
Now, that's what I'm hoping for...

128
00:06:23,727 --> 00:06:25,596
New town, new pussy.

129
00:06:25,873 --> 00:06:26,973
New customer base.

130
00:06:27,374 --> 00:06:30,435
My cousin Vernon'll take care of that.
He just needs the product.

131
00:06:30,745 --> 00:06:34,022
You sure Guillermo ain't got no
connections up there to fuck things up?

132
00:06:34,252 --> 00:06:38,197
- You know, that guy, he made me cry.
- Oakland's a long way...

133
00:06:38,553 --> 00:06:40,345
from Los Angeles, Marvin.

134
00:06:40,706 --> 00:06:42,739
You don't have to worry about Guillermo.

135
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:44,761
Sweet.

136
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,189
Yes.

137
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:47,538
Sweet.

138
00:06:52,632 --> 00:06:55,483
Keep the fanny pack
tucked inside your hoodie

139
00:06:55,603 --> 00:06:57,545
until we're back on American soil.

140
00:06:58,656 --> 00:06:59,881
They have quick hands.

141
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,842
Why can't you buy your drugs
in the U.S. like a normal person?

142
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:05,746
Because I have no health insurance,
no money,

143
00:07:05,866 --> 00:07:07,472
and an arrest record.

144
00:07:08,612 --> 00:07:11,762
Let's look at this
as a cultural expedition

145
00:07:11,882 --> 00:07:13,449
to a primitive land.

146
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,322
<i>Hola, señoritas.</i>

147
00:07:24,442 --> 00:07:26,324
Xanax? Valium? Ativan?

148
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:27,742
Restylane.

149
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:29,035
No Xanax?

150
00:07:29,195 --> 00:07:31,107
No Xanax. Restylane.

151
00:07:31,678 --> 00:07:33,289
<i>Dos</i> cc.

152
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,800
<i>Està bien.</i>

153
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:39,324
Where are we gonna live
when Dad's FEMA vouchers run out?

154
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,440
- I'll find a place.
- With what money?

155
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,843
With the money I am making from my job.

156
00:07:46,003 --> 00:07:47,303
As a salesclerk?

157
00:07:47,546 --> 00:07:48,346
Yes.

158
00:07:48,506 --> 00:07:50,890
- And where am I gonna go to school?
- I don't know!

159
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,642
Wherever Shane goes.

160
00:07:52,955 --> 00:07:54,644
I'll talk to Nancy.

161
00:07:55,605 --> 00:07:56,395
Xanax?

162
00:07:56,895 --> 00:07:58,263
No Xanax.

163
00:07:58,717 --> 00:07:59,899
Restylane.

164
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:03,736
- Generic cheaper.
- Mexican generic hyaluronic acid.

165
00:08:03,896 --> 00:08:06,355
Do I want to look like the joker?
No.

166
00:08:06,475 --> 00:08:08,263
No generic.

167
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:13,879
It's a front, isn't it?

168
00:08:15,187 --> 00:08:16,360
What's a front?

169
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,626
The maternity store.
It's a drug front.

170
00:08:18,786 --> 00:08:21,237
We passed a taco cart back there.
Why don't you go get one?

171
00:08:21,357 --> 00:08:23,182
- I don't want one.
- Well, I do.

172
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,439
- Get me one.
- Get it yourself.

173
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:27,927
I just spent months
getting everything for Dad.

174
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:28,948
Get me

175
00:08:29,388 --> 00:08:32,012
a fucking taco.

176
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:35,875
Look.

177
00:08:36,596 --> 00:08:38,604
You wanted this, not me.

178
00:08:38,891 --> 00:08:41,774
Well, you got it.
Welcome to my life.

179
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,873
Broke, homeless,
not a man in sight,

180
00:08:44,993 --> 00:08:46,904
although I know that's not your issue.

181
00:08:47,196 --> 00:08:49,652
No prospects, no direction,

182
00:08:49,772 --> 00:08:51,352
no hope for relief

183
00:08:51,872 --> 00:08:54,039
from the crushing defeat

184
00:08:54,473 --> 00:08:56,926
and futility and just...

185
00:08:57,676 --> 00:09:00,626
pure bad luck that is my fate!

186
00:09:00,786 --> 00:09:02,879
Walk with me here, okay?

187
00:09:03,187 --> 00:09:06,591
Arm in arm, mother and child...
doomed.

188
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,258
- Xanax?
- Yes!

189
00:09:15,491 --> 00:09:16,517
I want some.

190
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,644
I didn't know you were a smoker.

191
00:09:19,262 --> 00:09:20,812
Not for personal use.

192
00:09:21,842 --> 00:09:23,759
I can unload 300 pounds.

193
00:09:24,518 --> 00:09:27,096
You trying to get back
in the dealing game, <i>Blanca</i>?

194
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:28,946
I told you those days are behind you.

195
00:09:29,106 --> 00:09:31,081
- You're here now.
- And I intend to stay.

196
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:33,366
There's just no reason
why I can't do both.

197
00:09:33,486 --> 00:09:34,972
I'll give you a reason...

198
00:09:35,505 --> 00:09:36,787
we got it covered.

199
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,835
Not my customer base.

200
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:42,724
How about you give me their names
and their phone numbers?

201
00:09:42,844 --> 00:09:45,144
I'd be happy to service their needs.

202
00:09:45,422 --> 00:09:46,130
What?

203
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:49,175
- We partners, right?
- Are you gonna give me half?

204
00:09:49,493 --> 00:09:53,054
I was thinking a 10% finder's fee
is generous.

205
00:09:53,214 --> 00:09:54,472
They're my customers.

206
00:09:54,632 --> 00:09:56,655
You ain't your own business no more.

207
00:09:56,775 --> 00:09:59,977
All right, you're the mom-and-pop shop
that got swallowed by the megacorp.

208
00:10:03,345 --> 00:10:04,195
Well...

209
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:07,081
how about I buy some off you for...

210
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,278
5% over wholesale?

211
00:10:09,438 --> 00:10:12,573
How about I sell you 300 pounds
at 25 bucks a gram?

212
00:10:13,042 --> 00:10:16,202
Fuck you, 25 bucks a gram!
That's more than street value.

213
00:10:16,362 --> 00:10:19,205
That's my offer, right?
You don't like it, do something else.

214
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,334
You sure about this?

215
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:27,255
Trust me. It's their home base.
They're always here.

216
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:30,800
See? Look at this.

217
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,970
They're like Jews
in wedding hors d'oeuvres.

218
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,416
That's not cool.

219
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:37,617
Sorry, man.
Forgot you were a Jew.

220
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:40,249
I should never have said that
in front of you.

221
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:42,550
- <i>¿Cuànto?</i>
- Hi.

222
00:10:43,486 --> 00:10:45,118
We're doing some market research,

223
00:10:45,238 --> 00:10:47,650
and we wanted to ask
you fellas some questions.

224
00:10:48,404 --> 00:10:49,193
<i>¿Qué?</i>

225
00:10:49,353 --> 00:10:51,215
We're trying to launch
a coyote business,

226
00:10:51,335 --> 00:10:54,073
and we want to know
about your immigration experience.

227
00:10:54,643 --> 00:10:55,743
Immigration?

228
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,869
Im-mi-gra-tion.

229
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:00,037
<i>¡Inmigración!</i>

230
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,458
That went well.

231
00:11:06,882 --> 00:11:08,379
Well, look who it is...

232
00:11:08,604 --> 00:11:09,880
my walking buddy.

233
00:11:10,176 --> 00:11:11,620
I'm glad you stopped by.

234
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,051
Sometimes a man just needs some cheese.

235
00:11:14,211 --> 00:11:16,311
Well, that's what I depend on...

236
00:11:16,597 --> 00:11:18,097
men and their need...

237
00:11:18,257 --> 00:11:19,432
for cheese.

238
00:11:20,128 --> 00:11:21,100
You're sweaty.

239
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:23,227
It's hot out.
I walked.

240
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:25,021
No car?

241
00:11:25,808 --> 00:11:27,886
You only interested in guys with cars?

242
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,750
No. I have my own... car.

243
00:11:32,255 --> 00:11:33,070
Sweet.

244
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:35,340
Yeah. It's awesome.

245
00:11:36,471 --> 00:11:37,783
Are you making fun of me?

246
00:11:38,655 --> 00:11:39,452
A little.

247
00:11:44,248 --> 00:11:45,748
Where are you going?

248
00:11:47,244 --> 00:11:49,202
I turn 18 in a few weeks.

249
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,690
I'll be able to vote...

250
00:11:53,889 --> 00:11:55,602
buy lottery tickets,

251
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:56,979
drink...

252
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:58,509
in Canada.

253
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:00,153
Yeah.

254
00:12:00,642 --> 00:12:02,392
I have a 10-year-old son.

255
00:12:02,831 --> 00:12:03,681
I know.

256
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:05,773
I've met him.

257
00:12:13,516 --> 00:12:16,405
- You are so fucking young.
- Young...

258
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,564
and impatient.

259
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,410
I'm not waiting.

260
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,124
I have a sink in the back.

261
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:28,709
Sink?

262
00:12:29,305 --> 00:12:30,586
Something to hold on to.

263
00:12:32,008 --> 00:12:33,089
Hold on to me.

264
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:44,097
<i>Hola.</i>

265
00:12:45,981 --> 00:12:46,686
Hi,

266
00:12:47,005 --> 00:12:47,834
Cesar.

267
00:12:48,631 --> 00:12:50,931
Another unexpected surprise, I know.

268
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:53,818
Took my car this time, though.

269
00:12:56,391 --> 00:12:59,323
<i>Una</i> favor, <i>por favor.</i>

270
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:00,381
GPS?

271
00:13:01,332 --> 00:13:02,754
Oh, no. No GPS.

272
00:13:03,501 --> 00:13:06,824
Esteban...
I need to <i>habla</i> with Esteban.

273
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:20,325
No one here knows an Esteban.

274
00:13:21,415 --> 00:13:22,669
Oh, come on.

275
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:26,350
It's a common Mexican name...
Steven, right?

276
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:31,085
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

277
00:13:32,446 --> 00:13:34,569
Does he have a code name?

278
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:36,882
<i>Señor Grande?</i>

279
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,160
Please back the fuck off.

280
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:49,438
- What do you need?
- To have a conversation.

281
00:13:49,777 --> 00:13:52,168
- It's business.
- You don't do business with him.

282
00:13:52,924 --> 00:13:53,779
Right.

283
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,255
'Cause he's the mayor...

284
00:13:56,947 --> 00:14:00,347
Face on all the trash cans,
making things better for you.

285
00:14:03,185 --> 00:14:04,035
Look...

286
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,726
you can either bring me to him
or I can track him down myself.

287
00:14:09,718 --> 00:14:11,395
Make an appearance at city hall.

288
00:14:11,849 --> 00:14:15,059
I'll make a big scene
till I get his attention.

289
00:14:18,913 --> 00:14:20,710
Thank you, Cesar.

290
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,543
Oh, smile.

291
00:14:24,062 --> 00:14:25,951
You get to drive a hybrid!

292
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:29,769
Maria?

293
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:31,832
No?

294
00:14:31,992 --> 00:14:34,660
- <i>No sé.</i>
- Okay. All right. Gave it a shot.

295
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,409
Who wants another muffaletta?

296
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:40,257
- Yes.
- Thank you.

297
00:14:40,417 --> 00:14:41,592
Take it. Enjoy.

298
00:14:41,752 --> 00:14:43,064
So, Claudio,

299
00:14:43,712 --> 00:14:45,827
you think your friends
and assorted relatives

300
00:14:45,947 --> 00:14:47,973
might be interested in our services?

301
00:14:48,424 --> 00:14:51,018
A kinder, gentler coyote
is a rare thing, <i>el</i> Andy.

302
00:14:51,698 --> 00:14:53,694
How can I be sure
you're not deceiving me,

303
00:14:53,814 --> 00:14:56,604
looking to recruit, transport,
and harbor my people

304
00:14:56,724 --> 00:14:59,568
for the purposes of exploitation
or organ theft?

305
00:14:59,728 --> 00:15:02,196
Come on, <i>amigo</i>.
Would an organ thief make you lunch?

306
00:15:02,356 --> 00:15:04,303
That's why Miguel has only one kidney.

307
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:05,658
Really?

308
00:15:06,617 --> 00:15:07,660
You can't tell.

309
00:15:08,946 --> 00:15:10,830
You speak amazing English.

310
00:15:11,187 --> 00:15:14,291
Well, in Colombia, I was
deputy transportation administrator.

311
00:15:14,644 --> 00:15:17,753
Let's talk numbers.
What's the going rate per smuggle?

312
00:15:17,913 --> 00:15:19,579
Depends on how far they come.

313
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:22,841
But if it's just for a straight
border crossing, usually about $3,000.

314
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:24,301
Per body?

315
00:15:26,099 --> 00:15:27,349
Not bad.
Not bad.

316
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,874
And what are the easiest ways
to get through?

317
00:15:29,994 --> 00:15:33,185
Truthfully, wait until
the border patrol changes shifts

318
00:15:33,305 --> 00:15:34,853
and scale a fence.

319
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,356
Or find a place
where there's no fence.

320
00:15:37,517 --> 00:15:39,358
Won't the agents shoot us?

321
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,053
It's too much hassle for them.

322
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,001
Blood, bodies, paperwork.

323
00:15:43,306 --> 00:15:46,002
They don't get you in the first
2 minutes, you're golden.

324
00:15:46,775 --> 00:15:49,623
You know what your real problem is?
The minutemen...

325
00:15:49,743 --> 00:15:50,744
<i>vigilante...</i>

326
00:15:51,391 --> 00:15:52,701
pains in the ass.

327
00:15:54,236 --> 00:15:55,249
What the hell?

328
00:15:55,752 --> 00:15:59,509
If you're trying to snag this remodeling
contract out from under me,

329
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:00,713
I'll ruin you.

330
00:16:00,988 --> 00:16:01,688
No.

331
00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:04,508
No, no, no.
Doug and I are just doing

332
00:16:05,294 --> 00:16:08,036
some market research,
but now that you mention it,

333
00:16:08,285 --> 00:16:10,264
maybe these fellas
can help you out, too.

334
00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:13,142
- You guys know how to build a bathroom?
- With a giant tub?

335
00:16:33,489 --> 00:16:35,530
"We are here to inaugurate

336
00:16:36,076 --> 00:16:37,917
"this mobile medical unit."

337
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:44,099
"It will provide quality medical care

338
00:16:44,219 --> 00:16:46,277
"to all citizens of Tijuana."

339
00:16:49,296 --> 00:16:52,028
"With the violence that we have now,

340
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:54,308
"it is very important."

341
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:02,715
"He wants to thank a very
generous private benefactor."

342
00:17:05,854 --> 00:17:08,238
He is the generous
private benefactor.

343
00:17:40,069 --> 00:17:41,355
I love this part...

344
00:17:41,822 --> 00:17:45,192
the part where you sit there wondering
just how fucked you are.

345
00:17:45,612 --> 00:17:47,945
- Well, how fucked am I?
- Don't talk.

346
00:17:48,398 --> 00:17:49,613
Talking ruins it.

347
00:17:56,695 --> 00:17:58,952
Go get Miss Hodes a glass of water.

348
00:18:00,784 --> 00:18:01,523
Now,

349
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:03,791
Agent Shlatter.

350
00:18:04,757 --> 00:18:05,754
Yes, sir.

351
00:18:07,251 --> 00:18:09,075
This will serve as official notification

352
00:18:09,195 --> 00:18:12,136
that all charges
pending against Celia Hodes

353
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,930
have been dropped,
per my recommendation.

354
00:18:16,378 --> 00:18:17,288
Dropped.

355
00:18:17,408 --> 00:18:20,899
Initial the form where it says
and be sure to sign on the last page,

356
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:22,730
then leave it at reception.

357
00:18:30,705 --> 00:18:32,670
Now that this is all over,

358
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,886
you know, I was wondering,
since I'm all the way up here,

359
00:18:37,256 --> 00:18:40,414
- you know, if you don't have plans...
- I'm seeing someone.

360
00:18:44,285 --> 00:18:45,544
Thank you.

361
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:47,871
Goodbye, Miss Hodes.

362
00:19:03,263 --> 00:19:05,344
Esteban Carlos Reyes.

363
00:19:05,891 --> 00:19:07,512
You come from money

364
00:19:07,632 --> 00:19:08,883
in Mexico City,

365
00:19:09,138 --> 00:19:11,462
attended Columbia University...

366
00:19:11,729 --> 00:19:12,675
Go, Lions.

367
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:16,891
In 1990, you bought
the largest zoo in Mexico.

368
00:19:17,011 --> 00:19:19,328
Tragic story with the mauled panda.

369
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,063
Very upsetting.

370
00:19:21,306 --> 00:19:24,825
You moved to Tijuana in 1995
to build and manage a casino.

371
00:19:24,945 --> 00:19:27,497
You now own
three malls and five hotels,

372
00:19:27,617 --> 00:19:30,547
all very highly rated on hotels.com,
you'll be glad to know.

373
00:19:31,623 --> 00:19:33,592
In 2004, you were elected mayor,

374
00:19:33,753 --> 00:19:36,654
and then you set up
the Esteban Reyes Foundation,

375
00:19:36,774 --> 00:19:38,981
which offers scholarships
to under-privileged children,

376
00:19:39,101 --> 00:19:40,766
and you once dated Liz Hurley.

377
00:19:41,322 --> 00:19:42,887
Now we're just friends.

378
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,781
I can only imagine
what didn't make it onto the interweb.

379
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:47,880
But enough about you.
Let's talk about me.

380
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,050
Yeah. All right.
Let's do that.

381
00:19:50,228 --> 00:19:52,984
- I now know that I'm "O" positive.
- Congratulations.

382
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,280
Carlos.
May I call you Carlos?

383
00:19:55,698 --> 00:19:56,907
- No.
- Why not?

384
00:19:58,225 --> 00:20:01,502
- What do you want, Nancy?
- A piece of the next weed shipment.

385
00:20:01,622 --> 00:20:03,762
I can turn it around quickly.

386
00:20:06,812 --> 00:20:09,032
And you come to me with this?

387
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:12,256
- I do work for you.
- No, you work for Guillermo.

388
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,353
- There's a chain of command.
- He said no.

389
00:20:14,473 --> 00:20:16,135
Why would you think I'd say yes?

390
00:20:16,296 --> 00:20:18,386
He's punishing me
for getting in trouble with you.

391
00:20:18,547 --> 00:20:21,112
- And you don't think you deserve it?
- Not like that.

392
00:20:21,657 --> 00:20:22,895
Not by him.

393
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:26,395
- By me?
- Sure. By you. The Boss.

394
00:20:26,805 --> 00:20:29,291
Please, give me a piece
of the next weed shipment.

395
00:20:55,476 --> 00:20:57,626
Thank you for your time, Mr. Mayor.

396
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:02,317
The cheapest way is to tap
into the plumbing through here...

397
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:07,185
Remove the closet wall
and make this the bathroom.

398
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:09,813
And then we'll knock down
this wall first.

399
00:21:10,452 --> 00:21:11,971
Just give me a number.

400
00:21:14,755 --> 00:21:15,986
That's your mom.

401
00:21:16,146 --> 00:21:16,939
What?

402
00:21:18,246 --> 00:21:19,990
Well, then, can I have them?

403
00:21:22,027 --> 00:21:23,804
- I want to see them.
- No.

404
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:25,537
So what do you think?

405
00:21:26,569 --> 00:21:28,999
- I'll let you know.
- Hello!

406
00:21:33,506 --> 00:21:34,829
What's going on?

407
00:21:34,949 --> 00:21:35,945
Nothing.

408
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,723
- Hi, Mrs. Botwin.
- Hi, Isabel.

409
00:21:40,434 --> 00:21:41,247
What?

410
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:44,348
Why are you looking at me funny?

411
00:21:45,612 --> 00:21:47,142
Are these the bathroom guys?

412
00:21:47,399 --> 00:21:48,119
Yeah.

413
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:49,642
This is... Claudio.

414
00:21:49,762 --> 00:21:54,118
He was once the deputy transportation
administrator of Columbia.

415
00:21:56,728 --> 00:21:58,487
They're working up an estimate.

416
00:21:58,925 --> 00:22:01,703
Well, unfortunately,
we might have to...

417
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,411
wait on...

418
00:22:05,356 --> 00:22:06,096
that.

419
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,040
- Where's Silas?
- He went to the cheese shop.

420
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,265
Calcium.

421
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,061
That's nice.

422
00:22:14,383 --> 00:22:16,106
Honey, why are you hiding

423
00:22:16,226 --> 00:22:18,882
Sammy Davis' autobiography
behind your back?

424
00:22:22,173 --> 00:22:24,429
He had a baby
with a white woman, Mom.

425
00:22:27,897 --> 00:22:29,101
I found it shocking.

426
00:22:29,547 --> 00:22:31,395
He was protecting me.

427
00:22:33,782 --> 00:22:34,595
Okay.

428
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,360
We don't get
many bean counters volunteering.

429
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,072
We're mostly servicemen or cops...
Or used to be, at least.

430
00:22:43,132 --> 00:22:45,279
This has always been
a secret dream of mine.

431
00:22:45,399 --> 00:22:47,815
And now, with the wife gone...

432
00:22:48,215 --> 00:22:50,747
I got nothing holding me back.
I'm ready to kick some ass.

433
00:22:50,908 --> 00:22:53,372
You're looking to stimulate
the adrenals, or...

434
00:22:53,492 --> 00:22:55,002
do you just not like Hispanics?

435
00:22:55,162 --> 00:22:57,542
It's not so much
that I don't like them, sir,

436
00:22:57,662 --> 00:23:00,277
it's just that there's another group
of people I like more...

437
00:23:00,397 --> 00:23:02,819
- my fellow countrymen.
- Good answer.

438
00:23:03,086 --> 00:23:05,853
We don't tolerate bigotry...
officially.

439
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:09,720
Wish there were more like you,
Mr. Wilson.

440
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,435
We're vastly undermanned.

441
00:23:11,771 --> 00:23:13,578
So, do we get to pack heat?

442
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:17,157
Our mission is to secure United States
boarders and coastal boundaries

443
00:23:17,277 --> 00:23:19,484
against unlawful
and unauthorized entry.

444
00:23:20,002 --> 00:23:22,946
Individuals, contraband,
and foreign military.

445
00:23:23,106 --> 00:23:25,512
Now, if you choose
to arm yourself, you do so

446
00:23:25,632 --> 00:23:28,138
for the purpose of self-defense only.

447
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:30,564
But you'll never
have to take action

448
00:23:30,684 --> 00:23:33,832
because you'll abide by the rules
of no contact and no engagement.

449
00:23:34,854 --> 00:23:36,668
- Can I throw rocks?
- No, sir.

450
00:23:37,098 --> 00:23:38,712
So how do we nab these fuckers?

451
00:23:39,146 --> 00:23:40,226
We report.

452
00:23:40,747 --> 00:23:42,632
We observe.
We report.

453
00:23:44,753 --> 00:23:45,748
"Report."

454
00:23:46,576 --> 00:23:47,304
Gotcha.

455
00:23:47,963 --> 00:23:50,626
Like to start tonight?
Sun's going down.

456
00:23:51,712 --> 00:23:54,562
It all starts to happen
when the sun goes down.

457
00:23:55,128 --> 00:23:56,615
Crazy shit out there.

458
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:58,489
Crazy shit.

459
00:25:45,415 --> 00:25:46,115
Hi.

460
00:25:56,781 --> 00:25:58,351
I came to you first.

461
00:26:02,785 --> 00:26:04,065
You said no.

462
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,945
It's just business, Guillermo.

463
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:21,006
Thanks.
