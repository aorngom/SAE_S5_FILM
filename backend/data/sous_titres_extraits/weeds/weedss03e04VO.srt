2
00:00:02,315 --> 00:00:03,316
I got busted.

3
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,719
Head of campus security at Valley State.

4
00:00:05,824 --> 00:00:08,570
- We just got jammed.
- Here... This is yours.

5
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:11,575
If you need protection on campus,
just ask for me.

6
00:00:11,698 --> 00:00:14,013
You still owe me 150 G's, lady.

7
00:00:14,123 --> 00:00:15,980
How am I supposed to put...
food on my table?

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,344
You keep upping my debt.

9
00:00:17,444 --> 00:00:18,991
Get a fucking job.

10
00:00:19,948 --> 00:00:21,417
Chop that shit up, move it.

11
00:00:21,861 --> 00:00:24,054
- Can you grow here?
- Hell, yeah. It's perfect.

12
00:00:24,243 --> 00:00:25,790
Shame it's all gonna be for U-Turn.

13
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:29,740
Silas Botwin, you're sentenced
to 6 months of community service.

14
00:00:31,153 --> 00:00:34,032
Injury such as yours may have
rendered you unfit for duty in the past,

15
00:00:34,143 --> 00:00:36,781
I'm afraid times have changed.
Welcome to the army.

16
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:39,307
Your Battle Buddy
is like your Siamese twin.

17
00:00:39,529 --> 00:00:40,865
You gonna shit when I shit.

18
00:00:41,065 --> 00:00:42,065
Why are you doing this?

19
00:00:42,165 --> 00:00:44,184
Because I let everything
at line for you,

20
00:00:44,991 --> 00:00:45,996
and you fucked me.

21
00:00:46,096 --> 00:00:47,287
Kachichian says goodbye.

22
00:00:47,387 --> 00:00:49,234
- Peter is dead?
- Yes!

23
00:00:49,334 --> 00:00:52,384
Make the fucking bags lighter.

24
00:00:52,637 --> 00:00:55,809
Agent Fundis, DEA.
I'm here to talk about Peter Scottson.

Season 3 Episode 4

28
00:01:55,287 --> 00:01:59,091
We broke up...
me and Peter... Scottson.

29
00:01:59,751 --> 00:02:02,868
He hasn't come in to work for a few days
and we haven't heard from him.

30
00:02:03,065 --> 00:02:04,073
It's unusual.

31
00:02:08,301 --> 00:02:09,823
I don't know...

32
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,540
- We broke up.
- Look, Mrs. Botwin,

33
00:02:13,355 --> 00:02:15,147
- I'm his partner.
- The one who burps?

34
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,452
It's reflux.

35
00:02:16,643 --> 00:02:18,364
When did you last speak with him?

36
00:02:19,685 --> 00:02:22,810
Few days ago, he brought oranges.
Do you want them?

37
00:02:22,945 --> 00:02:25,689
- Why would I want them?
- I have no idea.

38
00:02:27,921 --> 00:02:30,020
Listen, we broke up.

39
00:02:30,297 --> 00:02:31,775
I think we established that.

40
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,678
When he brought this citrus over,

41
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:35,873
did he say anything to you?
Where he was going?

42
00:02:35,974 --> 00:02:37,065
What he might be up to?

43
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,557
- Work stuff?
- No.

44
00:02:39,383 --> 00:02:40,850
He didn't talk about work much.

45
00:02:40,986 --> 00:02:43,268
I didn't even know what he did 'til...

46
00:02:43,404 --> 00:02:47,615
I tried on his jacket once by mistake.
I was cold and... I had to pee.

47
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:52,831
About the break up, we were just...

48
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:55,662
you know, different places,
I think we just wanted...

49
00:02:56,096 --> 00:02:57,435
different things.

50
00:02:57,947 --> 00:03:01,227
I think he was working at some...
undercover investigation on his own,

51
00:03:01,662 --> 00:03:03,917
which is stupid but,
even when he goes indie

52
00:03:04,461 --> 00:03:06,906
he calls,
to let me know everything's fine.

53
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,651
He knows I worry.

54
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,596
- I hope nothing is wrong.
- Well, if you hear from Peter,

55
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:17,177
I'd like you to give me a call.

56
00:03:24,268 --> 00:03:25,410
He really liked you.

57
00:03:28,468 --> 00:03:30,290
Thanks for your time, Mrs. Botwin.

58
00:03:42,752 --> 00:03:44,285
Where is Peter?

59
00:03:45,514 --> 00:03:46,515
We broke up.

60
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:49,650
Is that gonna be a problem?

61
00:03:52,805 --> 00:03:53,868
What makes you so sure?

62
00:03:54,476 --> 00:03:55,622
Mummy just knows.

63
00:03:58,818 --> 00:04:01,464
<i>Behold.</i>
The incorporated city of Majestic.

64
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:05,897
A city... experiencing a rate of growth
few people could have anticipated.

65
00:04:06,228 --> 00:04:08,534
Now, we've been a noisy neighbour
and for that...

66
00:04:08,686 --> 00:04:09,998
I want to apologize.

67
00:04:10,757 --> 00:04:13,326
That sound
you heard coming from the East,

68
00:04:13,602 --> 00:04:14,609
the West,

69
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:16,184
the North... houses

70
00:04:16,406 --> 00:04:17,432
popping up like...

71
00:04:17,532 --> 00:04:20,092
so many Californian
wild flowers, well...

72
00:04:20,313 --> 00:04:21,314
that...

73
00:04:22,074 --> 00:04:24,015
is the sound of an economic miracle.

74
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,299
A month ago,

75
00:04:26,611 --> 00:04:30,077
our own city council had a session
trying to come up with a new town logo.

76
00:04:30,575 --> 00:04:33,314
Something we could put
on our signs, our brochures.

77
00:04:39,495 --> 00:04:41,414
Italy is shaped like a boot,

78
00:04:41,691 --> 00:04:44,052
Sicily, the ball
that's about to be kicked,

79
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,896
Majestic is shaped like a... well...

80
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,216
some people say, a horseshoe.

81
00:04:49,608 --> 00:04:51,307
Others, a smile.

82
00:04:52,502 --> 00:04:54,357
But, for some of us
who are aware of

83
00:04:54,457 --> 00:04:57,436
a particular infrastructure
problems facing Majestic,

84
00:04:57,536 --> 00:04:59,434
well, we saw a different image.

85
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:06,850
In the midst of all our backslapping,
we forgot a fundamental principle of...

86
00:05:07,581 --> 00:05:08,644
smart growth.

87
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,025
If you gonna poop,

88
00:05:10,495 --> 00:05:11,696
make sure you can flush.

89
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:15,770
What we need, is a ball.

90
00:05:17,641 --> 00:05:19,187
Agrestic is that ball.

91
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,880
Now,

92
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,864
in exchange for
the right to redirect

93
00:05:23,975 --> 00:05:26,557
a small portion of our sewage
through your town,

94
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,496
we'll retrofit
your existing sewage system with

95
00:05:29,648 --> 00:05:32,727
the most advanced technology available,
at no cost to you.

96
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:40,019
We also grant you unrestricted access
to all our recreational facilities,

97
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,241
including...

98
00:05:41,429 --> 00:05:42,948
our non-denominational

99
00:05:43,182 --> 00:05:44,577
modern house of worship,

100
00:05:45,116 --> 00:05:46,925
The Absolute Truth Ministry

101
00:05:47,643 --> 00:05:48,693
of Majestic.

102
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:52,159
Now I know these are
tough times for Agrestic,

103
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:53,932
your tax basis is shrinking

104
00:05:54,032 --> 00:05:56,475
while the cost of maintaining
basic services is rising.

105
00:05:57,627 --> 00:05:58,995
It doesn't have to be that way.

106
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:03,828
We're neighbours.

107
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,023
And this...

108
00:06:06,686 --> 00:06:07,687
is a hand

109
00:06:09,337 --> 00:06:10,815
extended over the fence.

110
00:06:12,624 --> 00:06:15,317
- Thank you Mr. Groff.
- Sullivan, please.

111
00:06:15,924 --> 00:06:16,931
Sullivan.

112
00:06:17,913 --> 00:06:18,920
Dumb name.

113
00:06:21,144 --> 00:06:22,144
Education.

114
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:23,975
Two and a half semesters at Berkeley.

115
00:06:24,154 --> 00:06:25,714
Graduated Berkeley.

116
00:06:26,502 --> 00:06:27,510
with...

117
00:06:28,075 --> 00:06:29,746
- honors.
- No lying.

118
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:33,062
- Thay can check these things.
- This is Agrestic.

119
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:35,665
No one's gonna check,
and you're gonna look totally lame

120
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:38,637
and stay unemployed if you don't lie,
'cause everybody else does.

121
00:06:41,278 --> 00:06:43,390
Remember that guy
who came to the door, last night?

122
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:45,062
- Peter's friend?
- Yeah.

123
00:06:45,795 --> 00:06:48,278
Even seen him like
looking around or anything obvious,

124
00:06:48,378 --> 00:06:49,812
seen his Impala parked around?

125
00:06:50,338 --> 00:06:51,857
- Working?
- Looking.

126
00:06:52,175 --> 00:06:54,357
No, I haven't.
Why would he be looking?

127
00:06:54,742 --> 00:06:56,110
Does he know you're a drug dealer?

128
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,900
No, I don't think so.
I just thought he is...

129
00:06:59,922 --> 00:07:01,497
- a lurker.
- Mum.

130
00:07:02,145 --> 00:07:03,236
Can you type?

131
00:07:03,636 --> 00:07:04,865
With two fingers.

132
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,233
Proficient...

133
00:07:09,105 --> 00:07:10,541
typing skills.

134
00:07:10,845 --> 00:07:13,413
- Now, what kind of job do you want?
- Anything.

135
00:07:13,758 --> 00:07:16,686
So long as there's no folding,
lifting or scooping involved.

136
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:20,165
Then I'll give you
a graduate degree in English,

137
00:07:20,303 --> 00:07:21,478
and we'll take it from there.

138
00:07:22,085 --> 00:07:23,273
Let's not overdo it.

139
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:25,717
I'm just...

140
00:07:26,005 --> 00:07:27,005
proud of you.

141
00:07:27,883 --> 00:07:28,912
What for?

142
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:32,108
Getting a real job.

143
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:38,342
Well, thank you, Shane.

144
00:07:43,368 --> 00:07:44,846
Go!

145
00:07:45,812 --> 00:07:47,124
- Come on guys
- Get up!

146
00:07:49,182 --> 00:07:51,384
Move it on!
Go Botwin, Rodriguez!

147
00:07:53,186 --> 00:07:56,086
Get that cock violated asshole
up that rope Botwin!

148
00:07:56,265 --> 00:07:57,302
So help me! If you don't,

149
00:07:57,402 --> 00:08:00,040
I will rip up by
your goddamn large intestin

150
00:08:00,436 --> 00:08:02,603
and string it up by
your tiny little pecker with it!

151
00:08:02,894 --> 00:08:05,048
- How fucking cool is this!
- We both gonna die.

152
00:08:05,228 --> 00:08:06,637
Let's go! Move it!

153
00:08:06,968 --> 00:08:08,252
Actually, you're gonna die.

154
00:08:08,557 --> 00:08:09,650
I'm gonna hide under your corpse

155
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,605
and pretend I'm dead
'til everybody's gone away.

156
00:08:11,705 --> 00:08:13,666
I ain't gonna be
nobody's dead body blanket.

157
00:08:14,549 --> 00:08:15,668
We're gonna get them first.

158
00:08:15,888 --> 00:08:17,104
We won't speak the language,

159
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,070
we know nothing about the culture.

160
00:08:20,173 --> 00:08:22,532
But we have the news
fuck you up good technology.

161
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:23,993
That sergeant is dead meat.

162
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,606
We're the fucking insurgents.

163
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:29,118
We're the goddamn USA,
we're the best,

164
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:30,422
we're the coolest,

165
00:08:30,653 --> 00:08:32,786
richest, most righteous nation on Earth.

166
00:08:32,984 --> 00:08:36,023
We're a death-laden nation
of religious hypocrits.

167
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,583
All we do well is...

168
00:08:37,954 --> 00:08:40,283
shop and drive gas guzzling SUVs.

169
00:08:40,424 --> 00:08:41,833
You're fucking Un-American!

170
00:08:44,144 --> 00:08:47,057
Get your corn holly shit
shit-stained asses over here*

171
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:50,304
What's with all the...
recurring homophobic imagery?

172
00:08:50,442 --> 00:08:52,251
I'm starting to worry about this guy.

173
00:08:52,643 --> 00:08:54,079
I think they're onto you man.

174
00:08:54,376 --> 00:08:56,124
I think you gonna get court martialled

175
00:08:56,227 --> 00:08:58,332
for that muslim loving shit
you've been spotting.

176
00:08:58,443 --> 00:09:00,169
Yeah? They're calling you over too!

177
00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:07,621
I want you two, soldiers,
to return to your barracks

178
00:09:07,721 --> 00:09:10,328
changing to fresh greens and
report to my office in 9 minutes

179
00:09:10,428 --> 00:09:11,665
Not 8, not 10.

180
00:09:11,975 --> 00:09:13,249
- Is that clear?
- What's up?

181
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:16,519
You do not ever...

182
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:18,479
ask a commanding officer "what's up"!

183
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:20,076
He's not your fucking friend!

184
00:09:20,261 --> 00:09:23,245
He's your goddamn master,
your motherfucking God!

185
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,279
- You hear me, sperm breath?
- Yeah!

186
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:27,511
- It's "yes sergeant"!
- Yes, sergeant!

187
00:09:27,994 --> 00:09:29,127
Fall out!

188
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,332
Lights in the church roof.

189
00:09:35,871 --> 00:09:37,597
- What shame is this
- Come on, Doug.

190
00:09:38,646 --> 00:09:39,655
It's my turn.

191
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,567
So... are we prepared to commit
our city to being Majestic's ball

192
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:49,680
because a guy next door
bought up a cool model?

193
00:09:49,846 --> 00:09:51,004
I'm not 100% sold.

194
00:09:51,104 --> 00:09:52,222
Do you understand the numbers?

195
00:09:52,322 --> 00:09:53,322
- I do.
- And?

196
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:56,475
And we have to be able to renegociate
on our terms and not theirs,

197
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:57,624
otherwise we...

198
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,262
What's going on?

199
00:10:00,974 --> 00:10:02,976
I thought that we dealt
with this last night.

200
00:10:04,426 --> 00:10:05,434
We did.

201
00:10:05,976 --> 00:10:07,258
Why are you here?

202
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,007
Why am I here?

203
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:10,553
Why is he here?

204
00:10:10,684 --> 00:10:12,091
- Slumming!
-Yeah!

205
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:13,570
And that's a good thing too,

206
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,376
'cause no one here knows his ass
from a spreadsheet on the ground.

207
00:10:16,577 --> 00:10:19,230
Or her ass, as the case may be.

208
00:10:19,396 --> 00:10:20,957
Thanks for coming by.

209
00:10:21,178 --> 00:10:22,593
But we don't need you.

210
00:10:22,794 --> 00:10:25,276
We agreed to hire
an independant accountant

211
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:28,331
who was gonna walk us
through the entire proposal.

212
00:10:28,635 --> 00:10:29,864
It's in the minutes.

213
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:34,545
- Right, Sarah?
- The city coffers are empty, Celia.

214
00:10:35,015 --> 00:10:37,649
Doug, what's your take
on this Majestic proposal?

215
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,560
Basically,
Majestic's overflowing a river of crap.

216
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,742
It's got no place to go,
but through us.

217
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:44,655
Like a physical colonic.

218
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:46,713
We got them by the sphincter.

219
00:10:48,494 --> 00:10:50,855
Shit highway could be
our road to riches.

220
00:10:51,214 --> 00:10:52,443
Our road to riches?

221
00:10:52,636 --> 00:10:54,183
You know, the last time I checked,

222
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:56,668
you weren't even on the council.

223
00:10:58,048 --> 00:10:59,733
Graduated at Berkeley with honors.

224
00:11:00,135 --> 00:11:03,095
Associate editor,
Oxford University Press.

225
00:11:04,482 --> 00:11:05,560
What division were you in?

226
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,935
- Sorry?
- What division?

227
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,548
Academic books, reference, trade?

228
00:11:11,927 --> 00:11:13,967
Academic textbooks, mostly.

229
00:11:14,888 --> 00:11:15,912
History,

230
00:11:16,128 --> 00:11:17,758
lots of civil war stuff,

231
00:11:18,651 --> 00:11:19,657
reconstruction.

232
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:21,761
And how did you like New York?

233
00:11:22,193 --> 00:11:24,035
Oh, it was...

234
00:11:24,753 --> 00:11:27,487
big, dirty, lots of people.

235
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,298
Coconut... Nice!

236
00:11:34,864 --> 00:11:36,452
You're a very beautiful woman.

237
00:11:38,717 --> 00:11:41,345
I bet you look good, rolling
right out of bed in the morning.

238
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,677
Or in it, the night before!

239
00:11:47,204 --> 00:11:48,351
I have... my moments.

240
00:11:48,737 --> 00:11:49,737
You know, if I hire you,

241
00:11:49,837 --> 00:11:51,593
I'll be paying for the right
to make comments like that.

242
00:11:51,693 --> 00:11:52,693
You okay with that?

243
00:11:52,793 --> 00:11:55,234
As long as you're okay
with being shut down every time.

244
00:11:55,788 --> 00:11:58,541
I like you, Nancy Botwin.
You're an operator.

245
00:11:58,862 --> 00:12:00,651
The resume's bullshit of course, but...

246
00:12:01,815 --> 00:12:03,484
the mind is there...

247
00:12:03,794 --> 00:12:05,307
Here is what I do,

248
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,298
I sell values based communities,

249
00:12:07,398 --> 00:12:09,851
which means that I, and you,
need to act the part

250
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:12,289
crucifix pin under the lapel,
smile on the face,

251
00:12:12,392 --> 00:12:13,746
and a pleasant word for everyone.

252
00:12:13,915 --> 00:12:16,529
No fucking the construction cruise
like my former assistant,

253
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:18,308
then broadcast it on the internet.

254
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,710
I don't do porn so much any more.
I found it very tiring.

255
00:12:23,657 --> 00:12:26,166
Now, Majestic is my night community

256
00:12:26,701 --> 00:12:28,299
and by far, the most ambitious.

257
00:12:28,426 --> 00:12:30,175
There's a lot that comes
through that door every day

258
00:12:30,285 --> 00:12:31,394
that needs to be delt with.

259
00:12:31,503 --> 00:12:32,542
For instance, today,

260
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:34,445
I need to find
personalized gifts

261
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,242
for every member
of the Agrestic city council

262
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:38,277
and I have no idea what they'd like.

263
00:12:38,565 --> 00:12:40,848
I can do that,
I know the people on the council.

264
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,663
I figured as much since Celia Hodes
who recommended that I speak to you.

265
00:12:45,913 --> 00:12:48,170
I think this is
what's referring to as kismet.

266
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,508
Psst! Hey, space shuttle!

267
00:12:58,494 --> 00:13:00,289
You've just gotten yourself a job!

268
00:13:01,905 --> 00:13:03,257
You start on Monday.

269
00:13:07,406 --> 00:13:10,235
Can't believe they expect us
to do this job straight!

270
00:13:10,469 --> 00:13:11,474
<i>Que?</i>

271
00:13:15,243 --> 00:13:17,884
<i>Si, Mota! Muy bien!</i>

272
00:13:21,021 --> 00:13:23,534
- Mrs. Gruber?
- Silas!

273
00:13:24,097 --> 00:13:26,851
Did you know that if you drink
and take Ambien,

274
00:13:26,954 --> 00:13:29,980
you can randomly blackout
and run your car onto a boulder?

275
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,438
*

276
00:13:32,117 --> 00:13:33,683
Who's that cute latino guy?

277
00:13:39,562 --> 00:13:42,118
It's so hot!

278
00:13:44,026 --> 00:13:46,112
Why don't you take your shirt off?

279
00:13:47,305 --> 00:13:48,358
I'm fine.

280
00:13:48,966 --> 00:13:51,043
You have nothing
to be ashamed of, you're...

281
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:54,778
you're young and lean
like ostrich meat.

282
00:13:56,342 --> 00:13:58,093
Have you been drinking Mrs Gruber?

283
00:13:58,663 --> 00:13:59,672
Don't tell!

284
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:03,455
Anyway, it isn't illegal unless
you're behind the wheel of a car, is it?

285
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:05,616
I guess not!

286
00:14:06,273 --> 00:14:07,433
I'm wet!

287
00:14:15,011 --> 00:14:17,200
How you know
how high to hang a light?

288
00:14:17,397 --> 00:14:18,514
30 inches above the plant,

289
00:14:18,618 --> 00:14:20,929
makes the upper root on my hemp
enough space to size.

290
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,087
And you gonna control
the temperature too?

291
00:14:23,187 --> 00:14:24,425
Not just controlling temperature.

292
00:14:24,525 --> 00:14:27,433
It also controls humidity, so the plant
don't grow bacteria nor fongus.

293
00:14:27,536 --> 00:14:30,163
Anything else you wanna know?
I'm a wealthy information.

294
00:14:31,464 --> 00:14:32,791
Kinda impressed, aren't you ?

295
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,923
You're like "Wow", that Conrad,
he knows what he's talking about!

296
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,781
If your dick was half
as small as your brain...

297
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,819
you would have stayed far away
from that girl like I told you.

298
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,617
If we're gonna work together,
you gotta get off my dick,

299
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:46,721
dumb as it might be.

300
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,822
Ain't gonna happen otherwise.

301
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:52,633
Fair enough.

302
00:14:53,402 --> 00:14:56,381
They need us, and we need them.

303
00:14:56,789 --> 00:14:58,834
Let's be their ball!

304
00:15:00,573 --> 00:15:04,080
No! This is closed session, Mr. Wilson.

305
00:15:04,716 --> 00:15:05,876
Hold that thought!

306
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,444
I have an annoucement to make.

307
00:15:08,618 --> 00:15:12,757
For personal reasons, I've decided to
give up my position on the city coucil,

308
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:16,044
so in accordance with
our by-law section 3-24,

309
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:18,813
paragraph C,
we're hereby compelled to elect

310
00:15:18,935 --> 00:15:22,045
an interim council member to replace me
until the next election.

311
00:15:22,271 --> 00:15:24,338
I'm now opening up
the floor to nominations.

312
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,560
I nominate Doug Wilson.

313
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,373
I second the Doug Wilson nomination.

314
00:15:27,888 --> 00:15:29,334
All those in favor of the resolution

315
00:15:29,434 --> 00:15:32,038
to elect Doug Wilson
as an interim coucil member, say aye!

316
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,479
- Oh, you guys!
- All those against?

317
00:15:35,651 --> 00:15:38,738
The resolution passes, Doug Wilson
will take my seat on the council.

318
00:15:38,845 --> 00:15:39,879
Effective immediatly!

319
00:15:39,992 --> 00:15:42,914
- No this can't possibly be legal.
- It is!

320
00:15:43,072 --> 00:15:45,737
- And what makes you so sure?
- I wrote the by-laws.

321
00:15:46,165 --> 00:15:47,533
So, now that that's that,

322
00:15:47,633 --> 00:15:49,699
I would like to open up
a new order of business.

323
00:15:49,942 --> 00:15:53,096
Since is no longer conflict of interest,
I would like to nominate

324
00:15:53,423 --> 00:15:55,274
Mitch Kamin, to contract

325
00:15:55,405 --> 00:15:59,442
all requisite landscapping
that will accompany shit highway.

326
00:16:02,245 --> 00:16:03,517
This is bullshit.

327
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:05,928
No Celia, it's human shit.

328
00:16:06,186 --> 00:16:07,834
You got to get
on the same page with us.

329
00:16:07,965 --> 00:16:09,797
I'm not gonna allow this to happen.

330
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:14,775
You are not going turn this into
your little corrupt kingdom, again.

331
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:18,551
This time, there is going to be
checks and balances,

332
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,019
there is going to be oversight.

333
00:16:22,121 --> 00:16:23,443
Are you hearing me?

334
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:25,616
I'm shaking.

335
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:29,017
<i>Dastrovia.</i>

336
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:43,064
Mummy got a job.

337
00:16:43,774 --> 00:16:46,503
- Icecream for everybody.
- I'm the only one home.

338
00:16:47,415 --> 00:16:49,396
Well then... more for us!

339
00:16:51,752 --> 00:16:52,910
What's your job?

340
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:57,527
I'm the new...
Westcoast Head of Random House.

341
00:16:57,676 --> 00:17:01,041
Mom, that's great!
I told you! Yes!

342
00:17:01,717 --> 00:17:02,726
Actually,

343
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:05,100
I'm the executive assistant

344
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,252
to the Head of the Majestic project.

345
00:17:08,446 --> 00:17:11,492
By the way, darling,
they do check resumes, so...

346
00:17:11,676 --> 00:17:13,732
let's thank God
mummy smells like coconut.

347
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,546
- Hello?
- Where the fuck is my money?

348
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,256
Hold on.
I'll be right back, sweetie.

349
00:17:30,387 --> 00:17:32,144
Hey, guess what, I got a job.

350
00:17:32,499 --> 00:17:36,218
Your job is being my bitch.
Where the fuck is my money?

351
00:17:37,116 --> 00:17:40,256
Okay, I'm having a little difficulty
moving your brick at the moment.

352
00:17:40,723 --> 00:17:43,115
It's mothercking weed.
Everybody like that shit.

353
00:17:43,302 --> 00:17:44,592
Sell it, and bring me the money.

354
00:17:44,692 --> 00:17:47,548
The DEA came to my house.
I can't make a move right now.

355
00:17:47,674 --> 00:17:48,674
<i>The fuck you can't!</i>

356
00:17:48,845 --> 00:17:52,131
DEA's been up my ass since I popped out
of my mama's secret place.

357
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:54,609
That didn't stop me one bit,
fuck them!

358
00:17:54,837 --> 00:17:56,308
I'm afraid I don't have
your confidence.

359
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,860
Then, find it, bitch!

360
00:17:58,236 --> 00:18:00,703
Fuck you, guinea, not so hard!

361
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:04,871
Look, I want my money,
you hear me?

362
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,123
Sell the weed
to the fucking DEA all I care.

363
00:18:08,292 --> 00:18:09,890
No more excuses.

364
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:23,573
Santa * California.

365
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,918
Valley State campus security.

366
00:18:32,217 --> 00:18:33,675
I don't mean to quibble,

367
00:18:34,311 --> 00:18:38,203
Mrs. Botwin, I don't want to invite
another visit from your friends, but...

368
00:18:39,432 --> 00:18:41,563
Some of these bags look
a little light to me.

369
00:18:42,628 --> 00:18:46,068
I assure you, they're not light,
it's just an airy plant.

370
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:49,302
- Look, you want it or not?
- Yeah, I'll take it.

371
00:18:50,068 --> 00:18:51,395
I don't have the money on me.

372
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:54,479
So, uh... I'll be right back.

373
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:56,032
Why would you not bring the money?

374
00:18:56,497 --> 00:18:59,152
I don't know, you...
you make me nervous.

375
00:19:00,217 --> 00:19:01,675
I make you nervous?

376
00:19:03,693 --> 00:19:05,133
You're scary.

377
00:19:05,284 --> 00:19:08,592
You're the scary lady
drug dealer with thugs.

378
00:19:08,872 --> 00:19:10,106
That's me.

379
00:19:10,536 --> 00:19:11,639
Go get the money.

380
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,180
Leave the bag,
go get the money, now!

381
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:17,096
- Okay, I'll be right back.
- That's right. You will.

382
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:25,956
I have to drive to
where the money is, so...

383
00:19:26,647 --> 00:19:27,974
You wanna...

384
00:19:28,647 --> 00:19:31,301
come with me or
wait here or what?

385
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,835
I'll wait here.
I'll be right over there...

386
00:19:34,243 --> 00:19:37,096
on that bench.
Okay? Make it snappy.

387
00:19:59,758 --> 00:20:01,160
This is boring.

388
00:20:01,851 --> 00:20:04,150
Get us out of
that fucking obstacle course.

389
00:20:06,711 --> 00:20:07,926
Alright, give me that phone.

390
00:20:08,991 --> 00:20:10,227
They said not to fuck with it.

391
00:20:10,327 --> 00:20:12,568
I'm not gonna fuck with it,
I just wanna look at it.

392
00:20:13,944 --> 00:20:14,954
Come on.

393
00:20:18,132 --> 00:20:19,571
What do you think could happen
if we make a call?

394
00:20:19,684 --> 00:20:21,257
We're not supposed to make calls.

395
00:20:21,441 --> 00:20:22,869
We're just supposed to turn it on,

396
00:20:22,969 --> 00:20:25,380
stand here,
let some drone take pictures of us.

397
00:20:28,637 --> 00:20:30,376
- What are you doing?
- Making a postcard.

398
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,778
Hey, that's funny!

399
00:20:35,884 --> 00:20:37,360
- Give me a lighter!
- What for?

400
00:20:37,996 --> 00:20:40,123
I want you to take a picture of me
ligthing my fart.

401
00:20:40,295 --> 00:20:42,295
Okay, that's the spirit.

402
00:21:16,706 --> 00:21:18,893
Jesus, lady!
I thought you were someone else!

403
00:21:24,622 --> 00:21:26,777
Come on!

404
00:21:27,547 --> 00:21:29,506
This phone has video,
we can make a movie.

405
00:21:29,939 --> 00:21:31,178
- Fuck!
- What's the matter?

406
00:21:31,278 --> 00:21:33,827
- I've got nothing, I'm tensing up.
- Give me that.

407
00:21:35,977 --> 00:21:37,510
Lemme show you how it's done, alright?

408
00:21:40,612 --> 00:21:41,662
Okay, hold on.

409
00:21:41,808 --> 00:21:43,303
Point the camera on my ass, hurry.

410
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,238
I don't want to see your balls man,
tuck'em in!

411
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:48,126
Alright, there, there, fine.

412
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,585
Ready? Okay, it's coming.

413
00:21:51,697 --> 00:21:53,099
It's a good one,
here it comes!

414
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,641
- Man, what is it?
- It's showtime!

415
00:22:05,174 --> 00:22:06,482
Holly shit.

416
00:22:09,547 --> 00:22:10,688
Something.

417
00:22:12,557 --> 00:22:13,847
Something, something.

418
00:22:16,221 --> 00:22:17,231
Evidence.

419
00:22:21,978 --> 00:22:23,361
Sorry Battle Buddy.

420
00:22:34,537 --> 00:22:35,771
<i>Merci, merci, madame.</i>

421
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,210
Please.

422
00:22:39,303 --> 00:22:40,855
Just like Paris, huh?

423
00:22:43,004 --> 00:22:44,008
Sullivan!

424
00:22:44,387 --> 00:22:45,471
I owe you a thank you.

425
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,742
Your friend Nancy,
she's gonna work out.

426
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,893
-Thanks.
- Honestly, the poor thing...

427
00:22:52,181 --> 00:22:53,251
Really is help.

428
00:22:54,705 --> 00:22:56,238
Entering the job market,

429
00:22:57,154 --> 00:22:58,406
you know, at her age...

430
00:23:01,116 --> 00:23:03,284
That "crouton" thing
they do on top of the soup,

431
00:23:03,844 --> 00:23:04,850
not good.

432
00:23:05,508 --> 00:23:06,994
Try the "croque-monsieur" next time,

433
00:23:07,161 --> 00:23:08,164
or the "quiche".

434
00:23:08,726 --> 00:23:10,605
You seem to know
your way around here!

435
00:23:11,605 --> 00:23:12,838
I travel a lot.

436
00:23:13,586 --> 00:23:16,035
There's a "café Du Merci"
in just about every city.

437
00:23:16,297 --> 00:23:18,609
Same menu, same framed posters,

438
00:23:19,026 --> 00:23:20,372
same smell.

439
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,081
There's a certain

440
00:23:24,651 --> 00:23:26,577
conforting predictability to it.

441
00:23:28,763 --> 00:23:29,907
You live around here?

442
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,482
I sort of, yeah.

443
00:23:32,613 --> 00:23:35,024
Yeah, I sort of. I'm in a hotel.

444
00:23:36,594 --> 00:23:38,893
- temporarily...
- Are you in the All Suites ?

445
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:40,753
That's where I am.

446
00:23:43,865 --> 00:23:46,220
I'm staying in
one of the other ones.

447
00:23:50,127 --> 00:23:51,435
Listen,

448
00:23:51,961 --> 00:23:53,575
what would you say
if we dump this crap

449
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,526
and go some place where the lighting
is better and there's a full bar?

450
00:23:57,081 --> 00:23:58,296
I'm buying.

451
00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:02,988
Thank you.
I think maybe another time though.

452
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,867
I insist.
Why are you alone?

453
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,134
I actually have some place
I need to be.

454
00:24:11,062 --> 00:24:12,408
I totally forgot.

455
00:24:13,137 --> 00:24:14,520
I'm sorry,

456
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,632
I have to go.

457
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:19,884
You know, thank you...

458
00:24:20,576 --> 00:24:21,579
though.

459
00:24:23,342 --> 00:24:24,520
A rain check.

460
00:24:26,776 --> 00:24:28,090
Should you reconsider.

461
00:24:30,108 --> 00:24:31,734
<i>À bientôt, mademoiselle.</i>

462
00:25:02,521 --> 00:25:04,166
<i>First new message.</i>

463
00:25:04,409 --> 00:25:06,773
<i>I know you been
dodging my calls, bitch!</i>

464
00:25:06,913 --> 00:25:09,174
<i>Did you move my brick?
I want my money.</i>

465
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:10,633
<i>If I don't from you soon,</i>

466
00:25:10,858 --> 00:25:12,855
<i>I'm gonna pay
you and yours a little visit.</i>

467
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:17,320
<i>I got a guy on payroll that just thinks
some fucked-up shit they do to people.</i>

468
00:25:23,493 --> 00:25:24,633
You're gonna be late.

469
00:25:25,848 --> 00:25:26,857
It's okay.

470
00:25:31,251 --> 00:25:35,868
You know, this community servicing
is totally unsupervised.

471
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,316
Every morning,

472
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,606
they tell me where to go
and what to do,

473
00:25:42,653 --> 00:25:45,948
but no one even bothers
to check and see if I show up or not.

474
00:25:46,354 --> 00:25:47,775
I still wait you showing up.

475
00:25:48,205 --> 00:25:49,457
The thing is...

476
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:52,578
I can pretty much do anything I want.

477
00:25:53,363 --> 00:25:54,952
No one is watching me.

478
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:57,234
No one.

479
00:25:58,055 --> 00:25:59,105
I'm watching.

480
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:01,649
Plus, I meet
lots of really cool people,

481
00:26:02,392 --> 00:26:04,672
people who like to have fun,

482
00:26:07,176 --> 00:26:08,746
people who would pay to have fun.

483
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:14,540
This is a non starter.

484
00:26:15,905 --> 00:26:17,251
I will never let you deal.

485
00:26:18,672 --> 00:26:19,775
You don't have the choice.

486
00:26:22,989 --> 00:26:24,148
I know you don't.

487
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,073
It's too dangerous.

488
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,914
I don't want this for you.

489
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,600
Come back here.

490
00:26:38,334 --> 00:26:39,792
We'll discuss this later.
