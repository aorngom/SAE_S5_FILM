<i>Previously on Weeds...</i>

2
00:00:02,097 --> 00:00:02,873
I've been shot.

3
00:00:03,042 --> 00:00:04,845
Are we sure this is
the way to the hospital?

4
00:00:04,948 --> 00:00:08,627
We ain't going to no hospital.
We got our own guy... Dr. Tupelo.

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,139
Dumb name will know my wrath...
The wrath of Doug.

6
00:00:12,272 --> 00:00:15,301
What kind of man tears a
cross off the roof of a church?

7
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:18,387
An impressive one, I'm guessing.
That's a big fucking cross.

8
00:00:19,632 --> 00:00:22,891
I need to rent your empty house.
We need a grow house.

9
00:00:23,153 --> 00:00:26,353
- How did that cross get in there?
- Doug snuck it in on Sanjay's shift.

10
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:28,507
I'm thinking of opening
up another supply line.

11
00:00:28,607 --> 00:00:32,860
There's this biker chick that Andy
wants to fuck and a guy named Chess.

12
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:34,862
Let me show you what I got for you.

13
00:00:35,074 --> 00:00:36,538
You're gonna be a loyal customer.

14
00:00:36,765 --> 00:00:37,948
This weed sucks.

15
00:00:39,086 --> 00:00:40,337
This is inferior product.

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,369
I don't think our business
arrangement's gonna work out.

17
00:00:42,581 --> 00:00:43,502
And why is that?

18
00:00:43,716 --> 00:00:45,873
My customers don't seem
to like your product.

19
00:00:46,135 --> 00:00:48,542
You weigh the pros and the cons,
and I'll be in touch.

20
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:51,248
Three guys on motorcycles pulled
me out of the car,

21
00:00:51,403 --> 00:00:54,095
they said they're coming after you.
They're coming after all of us.

22
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:57,346
How many motorcycles in Pittsburgh?
I don't know. I need to look it up.

23
00:00:57,834 --> 00:01:00,095
- Who are you talking to?
- Dad.

28
00:02:00,247 --> 00:02:01,573
We've got to hit them back.

29
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:03,821
No way we can let them
get away with this shit.

30
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:05,148
Okay, calm down.

31
00:02:05,937 --> 00:02:07,649
Let's get you looked at first.

32
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:11,875
- How's that arm doing?
- Hurts like shit.

33
00:02:12,137 --> 00:02:14,250
Well, try not to move it so much.

34
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:20,718
- Either of you armed?
- Broken-armed.

35
00:02:21,396 --> 00:02:23,757
I'm going to need a $500 cash deposit.

36
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:27,696
We only accept american currency,
and we no longer barter.

37
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,298
Good ol'american green.

38
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:35,232
Dr. Tupelo will see you now.

39
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,377
- He's gonna be fine, right?
- How much can you move the arm?

40
00:02:42,272 --> 00:02:43,329
Not broken.

41
00:02:44,495 --> 00:02:47,995
And the head wound... it
looks a lot worse than it is.

42
00:02:48,383 --> 00:02:50,799
Don't you want to X-ray him
or something?

43
00:02:50,906 --> 00:02:53,810
Ma'am, if you'd like a second opinion,
I could call my buddy over at cedars.

44
00:02:53,911 --> 00:02:56,599
He'll order up an MRI, it'll
run you at least 10 grand,

45
00:02:56,703 --> 00:02:58,246
and he'll tell you the same thing.

46
00:02:58,358 --> 00:03:00,711
System's broke, my friend.
I'm working outside of it.

47
00:03:00,825 --> 00:03:01,839
I hear you.

48
00:03:02,061 --> 00:03:05,626
How can we call ourselves a first-world
country when we can't even provide basic

49
00:03:05,726 --> 00:03:07,305
healthcare for our criminals?

50
00:03:09,619 --> 00:03:10,866
How deep is that cut?

51
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,768
Six or seven stitches.

52
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:16,190
And I'm out of Demerol.
I'm gonna give you a topical.

53
00:03:16,452 --> 00:03:18,442
A topical?
Are you kidding me?

54
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:22,295
Your boy looks like a tough young man.
He can handle it.

55
00:03:22,398 --> 00:03:23,399
I'm fine.

56
00:03:24,523 --> 00:03:25,604
Just do it.

57
00:03:29,153 --> 00:03:30,664
Now I remember you.

58
00:03:31,216 --> 00:03:33,562
You came in with U-Turn and Marvin.

59
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:36,104
I might have.

60
00:03:37,944 --> 00:03:39,885
Took me forever to find that tiny,

61
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:42,981
little bullet in the
middle of that big, fat ass.

62
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:45,219
Charged him double.

63
00:03:46,021 --> 00:03:49,515
Well, I'm hoping for a discount
since we're foregoing the painkillers.

64
00:03:49,777 --> 00:03:52,100
Still got to charge you
for parts and labor, honey.

65
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:55,531
Any chance you're a shrink, too?

66
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:04,321
- Is Judah here right now?
- Yeah.

67
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:08,138
- Where is he?
- Behind you.

68
00:04:09,305 --> 00:04:10,873
I don't know why I just did that.

69
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,033
- Because he's behind you.
- I don't see him.

70
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,739
He sees you.

71
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:18,412
Did you catch "The Sixth Sense"
on cable?

72
00:04:18,512 --> 00:04:19,875
Do you see dead people?

73
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:21,630
Am I dead?

74
00:04:21,913 --> 00:04:23,793
- No, you're alive.
- Okay.

75
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:25,412
What?

76
00:04:25,604 --> 00:04:26,992
I didn't say anything.

77
00:04:27,742 --> 00:04:29,618
- You tell him.
- Tell who?

78
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,015
Dad wants to say something to you.

79
00:04:33,312 --> 00:04:34,319
What?

80
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:39,558
Why don't you answer him?

81
00:04:40,452 --> 00:04:41,646
- Answer who?
- Dad.

82
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:44,568
Shane, if you're putting us on,

83
00:04:45,075 --> 00:04:48,349
I give you all the credit in the world
for fully committing to this.

84
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,974
Kudos. All right. Bravo.

85
00:04:51,573 --> 00:04:52,696
Answer Dad.

86
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,788
Fine, what's he saying?

87
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:57,571
He wants to know
why you let Mom down,

88
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,446
why you didn't take
better care of all of us.

89
00:05:11,606 --> 00:05:12,929
That's bullshit.

90
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:16,263
There must be a million
ways we can get those assholes.

91
00:05:16,363 --> 00:05:17,563
I have no muscle.

92
00:05:17,904 --> 00:05:19,079
I have no army.

93
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,694
I'm in heels, for Christ's sake.

94
00:05:21,695 --> 00:05:23,435
What the hell does that mean?

95
00:05:25,448 --> 00:05:27,194
Shane's not pretending.

96
00:05:27,622 --> 00:05:31,209
He actually thinks he's talking to
Judah. It's very Stephen King.

97
00:05:31,646 --> 00:05:34,453
- Where is he now?
- He's upstairs with Judah.

98
00:05:34,995 --> 00:05:37,073
And after hearing what Judah's
been saying to him,

99
00:05:37,223 --> 00:05:40,998
I'm starting to think he might actually
be communicating with the other side.

100
00:05:41,494 --> 00:05:44,755
Weird things happen when
these Santa Ana winds start blowing.

101
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:45,974
No.

102
00:05:46,088 --> 00:05:49,535
Andy, help me out here.
What the hell am I gonna do with Shane?

103
00:05:49,636 --> 00:05:52,985
Take him to a shrink. Should have
done it years ago, he's fucking nuts.

104
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:56,710
Go put ice on your bruises
like Dr. Tupelo told you to.

105
00:05:56,813 --> 00:05:59,047
Taking him to a shrink isn't a bad idea.

106
00:05:59,643 --> 00:06:00,648
Oh, no?

107
00:06:00,773 --> 00:06:03,432
What if he starts talking about
what his mommy does for a living?

108
00:06:03,535 --> 00:06:05,219
We just tell him to lie.

109
00:06:06,137 --> 00:06:07,780
Wait, I guess that defeats the purpose.

110
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,991
Why does everything have to blow up
simultaneously? It's not fair.

111
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,340
Things could be worse.
You could be pregnant.

112
00:06:16,495 --> 00:06:19,666
- Bite your motherfucking tongue.
- Relax. How could you be pregnant?

113
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,821
It's not like you're getting any.

114
00:06:23,377 --> 00:06:24,629
- Or are you?
- Shut up.

115
00:06:24,738 --> 00:06:25,870
- Are you?
- Shut up.

116
00:06:25,983 --> 00:06:27,178
- Are you?
- Quit it.

117
00:06:30,334 --> 00:06:31,336
Are you?

118
00:06:32,272 --> 00:06:33,274
Thank you.

119
00:06:35,316 --> 00:06:36,358
Hi, there.

120
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:40,352
I'd like to make a deposit.

121
00:06:44,431 --> 00:06:45,649
$15,000?

122
00:06:46,548 --> 00:06:47,818
It's been a good month.

123
00:06:48,873 --> 00:06:50,612
Fill these out. Bring them back.

124
00:06:50,965 --> 00:06:51,989
What are they for?

125
00:06:52,323 --> 00:06:56,994
One's for the IRS, which demands we
report any deposit over $10,000 in cash.

126
00:06:57,256 --> 00:06:59,705
The other's for the bank.
We like to keep internal records

127
00:06:59,805 --> 00:07:02,154
of any deposit in cash over $5,000.

128
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:07,232
I'm not sure...

129
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,517
I counted right.

130
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,942
Thank you.

131
00:07:12,868 --> 00:07:14,110
Oh, my slip.

132
00:07:20,868 --> 00:07:21,870
Hello?

133
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,606
Sullivan Groff speaking.

134
00:07:23,758 --> 00:07:25,841
<i>If you ever want
to see your cross again,<i/>

135
00:07:25,941 --> 00:07:28,310
<i>you better listen to me
and do the right thing.</i>

136
00:07:28,412 --> 00:07:30,178
- Who is this?
<i>- It doesn't matter.</i>

137
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,660
<i>What matters is that you make right
on all the promises you made</i>

138
00:07:32,761 --> 00:07:35,410
<i>to certain people,
certain very important people.</i>

139
00:07:35,606 --> 00:07:36,608
Wilson...

140
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:37,991
You piece of shit.

141
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,774
Shit.

142
00:07:42,057 --> 00:07:43,603
Fucking radio barn!

143
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:44,767
Shit.

144
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:46,506
Shit.

145
00:08:02,254 --> 00:08:03,268
Of course.

146
00:08:04,246 --> 00:08:06,981
We done planting, and rent ain't due
for another couple of weeks,

147
00:08:07,081 --> 00:08:08,255
so what you doing here?

148
00:08:08,378 --> 00:08:13,091
I need to know what you do
with all of your drug money.

149
00:08:13,614 --> 00:08:15,530
I never realized how useless cash is...

150
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:19,169
Can't deposit it in the bank,
can't pay my bills with it,

151
00:08:19,274 --> 00:08:22,559
and my family is not going to
get their hands on it.

152
00:08:22,966 --> 00:08:27,230
Sorry, I ain't training another white
girl in the ways of the drug business.

153
00:08:27,477 --> 00:08:29,544
Didn't turn out
too good for me last time.

154
00:08:30,151 --> 00:08:31,782
I'm your landlord,

155
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:34,796
and if I can't handle all of this cash,

156
00:08:35,336 --> 00:08:39,090
there's just no incentive
to rent to you.

157
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:40,810
Lord, help me.

158
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,912
Fine.

159
00:08:44,808 --> 00:08:47,784
First off, you take out 20%,
and you hide it...

160
00:08:48,744 --> 00:08:51,608
Furniture cushions, floorboards, up
your snatch if you got to.

161
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:56,244
Never know when you're gonna need it.
No, trust me. It's your savings account.

162
00:08:56,528 --> 00:08:58,263
Now, it don't earn no interest but

163
00:08:58,433 --> 00:09:01,535
there's nothing like cold, hard cash
when fate comes calling.

164
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,746
Okay, what about the other 80%?

165
00:09:05,008 --> 00:09:06,652
Take the rest, and you start a company.

166
00:09:07,851 --> 00:09:09,147
What kind of company?

167
00:09:10,532 --> 00:09:13,252
You know what? Why don't you find
yourself an accountant

168
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,655
that don't mind bending the rules

169
00:09:15,878 --> 00:09:17,756
and let him take care
of it for you?

170
00:09:22,641 --> 00:09:24,107
You gonna leave me to my reading?

171
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:26,735
Do you ever get scared?

172
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,473
About anything in particular?

173
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:30,920
Getting caught.

174
00:09:31,073 --> 00:09:32,941
Oh, no. You got to put
that out your mind.

175
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,380
It's like flying.

176
00:09:36,032 --> 00:09:37,735
Sure, the plane might crash,

177
00:09:37,935 --> 00:09:39,820
but you got to get to
where you're going fast.

178
00:09:40,036 --> 00:09:42,091
So in the end, it's worth the risk.

179
00:09:48,222 --> 00:09:49,596
We're gonna be friends.

180
00:09:55,954 --> 00:09:56,964
Lord, help me.

181
00:09:58,443 --> 00:09:59,851
What does he say to you?

182
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:01,806
He likes the way you wear your hair now.

183
00:10:02,964 --> 00:10:03,972
He does?

184
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,315
But he's angry.

185
00:10:10,051 --> 00:10:11,060
At who?

186
00:10:11,765 --> 00:10:12,769
All of us.

187
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,064
- Oh yes, is he?
- Yeah.

188
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:18,317
Well, tell him that's not fair.

189
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,254
You tell him.

190
00:10:20,665 --> 00:10:22,782
- He's here.
- Oh, Shane.

191
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,159
No,

192
00:10:28,652 --> 00:10:29,685
he's not.

193
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:31,822
He's dead.

194
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,008
You saw him.

195
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:34,746
You were there.

196
00:10:36,037 --> 00:10:37,398
Please, don't do this anymore.

197
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,965
It's making me really sad.

198
00:10:39,864 --> 00:10:40,956
Why?

199
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:42,836
Don't you love him?

200
00:10:45,758 --> 00:10:47,321
I'll always love the memory of him.

201
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,614
What?

202
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,024
He says he still loves you.

203
00:10:57,468 --> 00:11:00,373
Shane, this is you talking, isn't it?

204
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,381
No, it's not.

205
00:11:10,034 --> 00:11:11,081
Don't be mad at me.

206
00:11:12,444 --> 00:11:13,454
I'm not mad.

207
00:11:13,642 --> 00:11:15,109
I'm just scared.

208
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,144
She's mad.

209
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,169
Can I help you?

210
00:11:42,197 --> 00:11:43,794
Hello, I'm Eve Meriweather.

211
00:11:44,474 --> 00:11:45,555
Good for you.

212
00:11:45,863 --> 00:11:47,120
I'm going door-to-door.

213
00:11:47,222 --> 00:11:49,321
We're trying to mobilize
the entire neighborhood

214
00:11:49,427 --> 00:11:51,693
to keep an eye out
for any suspicious behavior.

215
00:11:52,162 --> 00:11:53,325
Suspicious behavior?

216
00:11:53,454 --> 00:11:55,065
You haven't seen anything strange?

217
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,413
I can't say that I have.

218
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,559
Are you sure?

219
00:11:58,005 --> 00:11:59,921
What is it I'm supposed to
be looking out for?

220
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:03,147
Why our cross, of course.

221
00:12:06,306 --> 00:12:08,701
- Someone stole your cross?
- Yes.

222
00:12:09,265 --> 00:12:10,756
That is a damn shame.

223
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,128
- Who would do something like that?
- Jews.

224
00:12:14,698 --> 00:12:15,960
Well, I haven't seen it.

225
00:12:16,242 --> 00:12:18,006
Haven't seen many
jews around here, either.

226
00:12:18,107 --> 00:12:19,442
Well, they're mostly urban.

227
00:12:20,503 --> 00:12:21,536
You're new here.

228
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,776
Just moved in.

229
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,198
Oh, and you must be the wife.

230
00:12:26,501 --> 00:12:28,074
And you must be?

231
00:12:28,368 --> 00:12:29,389
Eve Meriweather.

232
00:12:29,964 --> 00:12:32,054
Well, look at him.

233
00:12:32,254 --> 00:12:33,570
Hello, baby.

234
00:12:35,176 --> 00:12:38,678
Why are little black babies
always so adorable?

235
00:12:39,598 --> 00:12:41,426
Why are white babies always so ugly?

236
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:45,800
Sense of humor.

237
00:12:47,285 --> 00:12:50,302
Well, you know what, thank you
for dropping by, and, yes,

238
00:12:50,525 --> 00:12:52,547
if I see your cross,
I will call the number.

239
00:12:54,647 --> 00:12:56,130
See you all in church, I hope.

240
00:12:56,704 --> 00:12:58,348
Sure. Church.

241
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:00,136
- Praise the Lord.
- Hallelujah.

242
00:13:04,528 --> 00:13:05,737
I hate white idiots.

243
00:13:06,524 --> 00:13:07,757
White idiots named Doug.

244
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,967
{\TRADUIRE EN VF}

245
00:13:20,544 --> 00:13:21,554
Celia.

246
00:13:23,013 --> 00:13:24,516
To what do I owe this horror?

247
00:13:24,621 --> 00:13:25,866
All right, save it.

248
00:13:26,015 --> 00:13:27,432
I'm here on business.

249
00:13:27,924 --> 00:13:31,142
I need a slimy, crooked accountant
with no scruples

250
00:13:31,247 --> 00:13:33,572
who will do anything to make a buck,
and unfortunately,

251
00:13:33,952 --> 00:13:35,361
you're the only one I know.

252
00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:38,115
What makes you think I
would lift a finger to help you?

253
00:13:45,338 --> 00:13:48,309
- How can I help you?
- You can set up a dummy corporation

254
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,148
for me to funnel cash through.

255
00:13:50,986 --> 00:13:52,117
You did it for Nancy.

256
00:13:52,555 --> 00:13:53,576
I like Nancy.

257
00:13:53,878 --> 00:13:56,403
Yeah, everybody likes Nancy.
Everybody hates Celia.

258
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,909
Time for everyone to come
up with a new narrative.

259
00:13:59,044 --> 00:14:01,626
- We like the old narrative. Felt right
- Tough.

260
00:14:02,085 --> 00:14:03,551
I'm not on the outside anymore.

261
00:14:04,016 --> 00:14:05,965
I am part of this operation,

262
00:14:06,454 --> 00:14:08,106
whether anyone likes it or not,

263
00:14:08,243 --> 00:14:10,260
and I intend to get my fair share.

264
00:14:15,978 --> 00:14:17,011
What?

265
00:14:18,603 --> 00:14:20,520
I really want to have
sex with you right now.

266
00:14:22,011 --> 00:14:23,503
You do?

267
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:29,310
I guess I must have some sort
of a castrating bitch fetish.

268
00:14:29,732 --> 00:14:30,738
Yeah?

269
00:14:31,645 --> 00:14:33,171
I'm really hard.

270
00:14:34,205 --> 00:14:35,214
Feel.

271
00:14:41,344 --> 00:14:42,696
Don't waste it on me.

272
00:14:42,813 --> 00:14:45,843
I'd sooner lose a leg than
suck your dick again.

273
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,173
Set up the corporation fast.

274
00:14:48,435 --> 00:14:50,466
I have major bills to pay.

275
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,365
You are working for me now.

276
00:14:54,996 --> 00:14:56,442
How about "Ball Busters, inc"?

277
00:14:56,572 --> 00:14:59,058
Yeah, whatever. Work it out, bitch.

278
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:09,078
What are we waiting for?

279
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,779
Where did you get this?

280
00:15:12,118 --> 00:15:13,817
Conrad had it at the grow house.

281
00:15:13,937 --> 00:15:15,280
Does he know you took it?

282
00:15:15,387 --> 00:15:16,391
No.

283
00:15:17,805 --> 00:15:19,720
We can't just stand
around and do nothing.

284
00:15:19,825 --> 00:15:21,305
They'll just hit us again.

285
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:22,932
Let me worry about it.

286
00:15:23,032 --> 00:15:25,114
You're not the one that
got the shit beat out of them.

287
00:15:25,236 --> 00:15:26,570
You're right, I wasn't.

288
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,256
I'm also not going up against
an army of drug-dealing bikers

289
00:15:30,518 --> 00:15:33,063
with a 17-year-old boy,

290
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,281
a flamboyant hindi queen,

291
00:15:35,398 --> 00:15:37,148
and a 4-foot-tall Jesus-loving

292
00:15:37,441 --> 00:15:38,921
pixie as my posse.

293
00:15:39,444 --> 00:15:40,708
So what do we do, then?

294
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,363
They won't let us deal.
We can't sell their shitty ditch weed.

295
00:15:43,492 --> 00:15:44,812
We're out of options.

296
00:15:46,508 --> 00:15:47,729
I'll think of something.

297
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:50,777
You better do it fast, because the
next crop of MILF is almost ready.

298
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,188
Don't you have other things to do?
Go to the mall or something...

299
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:56,419
- Be normal?
- Like it or not,

300
00:15:56,525 --> 00:15:58,556
this is a family business now.

301
00:15:58,721 --> 00:16:00,599
Then let the head of the family
worry about it.

302
00:16:00,721 --> 00:16:02,355
The head of the family's dead.

303
00:16:03,501 --> 00:16:05,085
At least that isn't my fault.

304
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:12,375
Chess is mad, and when he's mad,
he does stupid things.

305
00:16:12,602 --> 00:16:16,238
Beating the shit out of
a defenseless teenage kid is psycho.

306
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:20,195
Unfortunately, there's not much
I can do to stop him, never has been.

307
00:16:20,974 --> 00:16:23,265
Then what the hell am I doing here?
I never wash my van.

308
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,483
- You're here because of me.
- No, no, no, no.

309
00:16:28,328 --> 00:16:30,377
This Romeo and Juliet shit
isn't working for me...

310
00:16:30,665 --> 00:16:32,753
Not if there isn't anything
you can do to stop him.

311
00:16:33,723 --> 00:16:34,737
I tried.

312
00:16:37,213 --> 00:16:39,268
- I really did.
- You tell your brother,

313
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:42,921
if he ever touches anyone
in my family again, I will kill him.

314
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:53,573
Okay, maybe don't pass
that message along,

315
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,666
but just know in your heart,
his behavior is unacceptable.

316
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:01,687
- Call me?
- Yeah, maybe.

317
00:17:13,255 --> 00:17:14,474
You here for a date?

318
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:16,337
No.

319
00:17:17,755 --> 00:17:18,770
No date.

320
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:30,699
- I need help.
- You try home depot?

321
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:33,825
Plenty of Mexicans there
that can help you.

322
00:17:33,945 --> 00:17:35,481
Not that kind of help.

323
00:17:35,831 --> 00:17:37,868
I'm being shaken down
by some bikers in the hills.

324
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,591
- Yeah? I know them.
- You know them?

325
00:17:40,918 --> 00:17:44,015
<i>Señorita</i>, I know everybody who tries
to peddle shit in sunny L.A.

326
00:17:44,642 --> 00:17:47,103
And I mean shit.
They grow garbage.

327
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:51,638
- They are garbage.
- They beat up my son.

328
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:55,329
They're threatening me.
So what do you want from me?

329
00:17:58,009 --> 00:17:59,070
Protection.

330
00:17:59,201 --> 00:18:02,041
And what do I get in
return for this protection?

331
00:18:04,198 --> 00:18:06,120
My undying gratitude?

332
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:12,335
How about in return,
we're partners?

333
00:18:13,247 --> 00:18:15,380
- What kind of partners?
- 50/50 partners.

334
00:18:15,907 --> 00:18:17,325
- Half?
- Of everything.

335
00:18:21,007 --> 00:18:22,831
Can I think about it
and get back to you?

336
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:25,125
No, you cannot.
Yes or no.

337
00:18:25,548 --> 00:18:27,717
Deal or no deal.
<i>Ahora</i>.

338
00:18:29,905 --> 00:18:32,647
What kind of protection
would I get for half of everything?

339
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,983
You get total protection.

340
00:18:36,925 --> 00:18:38,194
No more shakedowns.

341
00:18:38,647 --> 00:18:40,780
Anyone fucks with you,
they fuck with me.

342
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,866
When they go down,
they go down hard.

343
00:18:46,347 --> 00:18:48,070
- Fine.
- Good.

344
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,543
You don't got to worry
about those biker <i>pendejos</i> anymore.

345
00:18:53,574 --> 00:18:56,468
- I'll take care of them.
- What are you gonna do?

346
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:58,612
Don't you worry, <i>chelita</i>.

347
00:19:05,234 --> 00:19:07,941
- What if they come after me?
- They ain't gonna come after you.

348
00:19:08,709 --> 00:19:11,573
They're gonna be thanking <i>Jesus Cristo</i>
that they're still breathing.

349
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:16,247
Then they're gonna get on those
ridiculous <i>maricónbikes</i> they ride,

350
00:19:16,379 --> 00:19:17,984
and head to Canada.

351
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:21,626
Then word's gonna spread
that you're being protecting by me,

352
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:24,520
and that's gonna allow you
to conduct your business in peace.

353
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,289
- I could use a little peace.
- You'll have it.

354
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,628
And you tell your son,

355
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:37,257
no one is ever
gonna mess with him again.

356
00:19:57,687 --> 00:19:59,484
I believe this belongs to you.

357
00:20:01,355 --> 00:20:04,329
You might want to try and hide it
a little better next time.

358
00:20:04,449 --> 00:20:06,663
- How you get it?
- Silas took it.

359
00:20:09,571 --> 00:20:12,913
He wanted me to use it
to blow the bikers away.

360
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:18,658
Like your hero U-Turn?
Silas got a tattoo on his ass, too?

361
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:21,050
Will you let that go already?

362
00:20:21,777 --> 00:20:24,455
Jealous Conrad.
So not sexy.

363
00:20:24,994 --> 00:20:27,748
Should I be carrying this on me?
What's going on with said bikers?

364
00:20:28,844 --> 00:20:30,414
It's taken care of.

365
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,788
- I went and bought some protection.
- From who?

366
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,235
- Guillermo.
- So we working for Guillermo now?

367
00:20:43,553 --> 00:20:45,370
God damn, girl!

368
00:20:45,738 --> 00:20:48,067
You realize you're just trading
one gangster for another?

369
00:20:48,172 --> 00:20:51,734
Yes. I also realize
that I have no choice.

370
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:54,362
These things are gonna keep
happening to me.

371
00:20:54,944 --> 00:20:58,230
If I don't have any muscle behind me,
I won't be able to do my business.

372
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:04,007
Like it or not, I'm...
a drug dealer.

373
00:21:06,222 --> 00:21:09,128
Say it out loud.
I'm a fucking drug dealer.

374
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:13,499
- How much he asks?
- Half.

375
00:21:15,323 --> 00:21:16,327
Half?

376
00:21:16,431 --> 00:21:19,551
I let my son be a part of this,
and I couldn't protect him.

377
00:21:19,657 --> 00:21:20,852
It was my fault.

378
00:21:21,872 --> 00:21:23,651
I did what I had to do
to protect my family.

379
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:26,855
- And who protects us from Guillermo?
- I can handle Guillermo.

380
00:21:26,975 --> 00:21:28,206
How, by fucking him?

381
00:21:32,321 --> 00:21:33,950
That is so not fair.

382
00:21:42,673 --> 00:21:45,169
It's just that
we in this together now.

383
00:21:47,513 --> 00:21:48,567
You...

384
00:21:53,758 --> 00:21:54,942
and me.

385
00:21:59,149 --> 00:22:00,684
And your boy Guillermo.

386
00:22:09,724 --> 00:22:12,150
Ain't this the fucking shit?

387
00:22:15,425 --> 00:22:18,786
The two garys did some flyovers
with the thermal-imaging camera,

388
00:22:18,915 --> 00:22:21,000
- brought back some sweet shots.
- Anything sexy?

389
00:22:21,692 --> 00:22:22,781
Two meth labs.

390
00:22:23,321 --> 00:22:25,324
If the patriot act had tits,
I'd buy it a steak.

391
00:22:26,701 --> 00:22:28,898
Wait, go back one.

392
00:22:32,109 --> 00:22:33,122
Zoom in.

393
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,761
Closer.

394
00:22:40,251 --> 00:22:41,706
- Who you calling?
- Majestic.

395
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:45,452
I read an article in the paper about
this cross of theirs that got stolen.

396
00:22:45,585 --> 00:22:47,603
I think I just found it.
Not our problem.

397
00:22:47,723 --> 00:22:49,165
It's called moral duty.

398
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,991
- Where's your respect for the Lord?
- Whose Lord we talking about? Not mine.

399
00:22:55,638 --> 00:22:58,928
If you ask me, a cross that size
is for a Lord with a tiny dick.

400
00:23:05,174 --> 00:23:06,756
- What's going on?
- Fire.

401
00:23:08,373 --> 00:23:09,563
That's a big one.

402
00:23:10,043 --> 00:23:11,789
- Where is it?
- Here.

403
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:13,887
It started somewhere in the foothills.

404
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,356
Then it jumped the highway,
and now it's right here.

405
00:23:17,157 --> 00:23:19,418
The Santa Ana winds
aren't helping matters.

406
00:23:19,797 --> 00:23:23,501
The fire department is issuing
voluntary evacuation orders.

407
00:23:23,676 --> 00:23:27,649
Denise just called, said the fire
started in their grow field.

408
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,112
Someone torched it.

409
00:23:31,721 --> 00:23:34,281
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

410
00:23:37,814 --> 00:23:40,705
- What are we gonna do?
- Does that mean we have to leave?

411
00:23:41,283 --> 00:23:44,283
- What about the grow house?
- Nance, any ideas?

412
00:23:46,334 --> 00:23:50,100
Shane, ask Judah
if he has any suggestions.
