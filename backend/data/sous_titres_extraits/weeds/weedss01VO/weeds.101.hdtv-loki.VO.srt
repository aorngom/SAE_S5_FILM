1
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:23,269
Little boxes on the hillside,

2
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,084
Little boxes made of ticky-tacky,

3
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,669
Little boxes on the hillside,

4
00:00:28,726 --> 00:00:31,041
Little boxes, all the same.

5
00:00:31,102 --> 00:00:33,492
There's a green one and a pink one

6
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:36,376
And a blue one and a yellow one

7
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,962
And they're all made out of ticky-tacky

8
00:00:39,013 --> 00:00:41,869
And they all look just the same.

9
00:00:42,863 --> 00:00:45,325
And the people in the houses

10
00:00:45,398 --> 00:00:48,162
All went to the university,

11
00:00:48,212 --> 00:00:50,685
And they were all put in boxes,

12
00:00:50,749 --> 00:00:53,403
And they came out all the same.

13
00:00:53,463 --> 00:00:55,974
And there's doctors and lawyers

14
00:00:56,067 --> 00:00:58,932
And business executives,

15
00:00:58,986 --> 00:01:01,502
And they're all made out of ticky-tacky

16
00:01:01,555 --> 00:01:05,513
And they all look just the same.

17
00:01:09,775 --> 00:01:12,540
So, I really think it's important

18
00:01:12,598 --> 00:01:15,230
that we remove all soft drinks

19
00:01:15,278 --> 00:01:17,790
from the vending machines and replace them with

20
00:01:17,888 --> 00:01:21,781
bottled water and naturally sweetened fruit juice.

21
00:01:21,866 --> 00:01:24,952
Are you talking about diet soda too?

22
00:01:25,045 --> 00:01:28,053
Because I don't think we should take away the diet soda.

23
00:01:28,116 --> 00:01:30,891
So many of our girls are watching their weight.

24
00:01:30,956 --> 00:01:32,431
All those girls are 11.

25
00:01:32,636 --> 00:01:34,241
They shouldn't be dieting.

26
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:37,072
I think she's got a little botie between the eyes.

27
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,343
That's just naive.

28
00:01:38,415 --> 00:01:41,120
She probably treated herself, poor thing.

29
00:01:41,207 --> 00:01:44,880
If my husband dropped dead, I'd suck out, lift up and inject anything that moves.

30
00:01:44,946 --> 00:01:46,932
I know that you've got boys so

31
00:01:46,997 --> 00:01:48,333
you may not understand...

32
00:01:48,397 --> 00:01:49,771
Understand what?

33
00:01:50,335 --> 00:01:53,051
That our children shouldn't be guzzling sugar and chemicals?

34
00:01:53,127 --> 00:01:56,033
No, we are in total agreement about the sugar.

35
00:01:56,126 --> 00:01:58,710
All the sugary drinks should go.

36
00:01:58,787 --> 00:02:03,873
So everyone in favor of eliminating the sugary drinks from the vending machines, ladies...

37
00:02:05,108 --> 00:02:06,530
Ladies!

38
00:02:07,036 --> 00:02:08,372
Wonderful!

39
00:02:09,048 --> 00:02:10,242
That's done.

40
00:02:10,308 --> 00:02:12,272
Thank you, Nancy Botwin.

41
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:14,613
Head of our healthy children's committee.

42
00:02:15,398 --> 00:02:16,680
Now, let's take a break.

43
00:02:16,768 --> 00:02:18,520
She's got the big bag.

44
00:02:18,607 --> 00:02:21,323
I guess he left her pretty well fixed, huh?

45
00:02:21,455 --> 00:02:22,963
I heard there was nothing.

46
00:02:23,057 --> 00:02:25,091
They spent all that money on the new kitchen.

47
00:02:25,248 --> 00:02:26,440
Have you seen it?

48
00:02:26,728 --> 00:02:28,830
It turned out gorgeous.

49
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:31,361
So give yourselves a round of applause everyone.

50
00:02:36,105 --> 00:02:37,983
I wonder how she's getting by.

51
00:02:40,177 --> 00:02:43,251
Nancy, we were all just saying how much we love your purse.

52
00:02:43,346 --> 00:02:44,422
It's a knock-off.

53
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:45,851
But you can't even tell.

54
00:02:45,937 --> 00:02:46,833
Let me see that.

55
00:02:46,908 --> 00:02:48,783
Ray should buy one of these.

56
00:02:48,846 --> 00:02:49,850
How much you paid?

57
00:02:49,948 --> 00:02:51,190
75 bucks.

58
00:02:51,257 --> 00:02:53,062
Ray should take one look at that crooked stitch

59
00:02:53,127 --> 00:02:54,730
and then she'd know you're a cheap trick.

60
00:02:54,836 --> 00:02:56,500
The stitching on this bag is perfect.

61
00:02:58,567 --> 00:03:00,163
Oh yeah. Right there.

62
00:03:00,768 --> 00:03:01,993
Goddamn it!

63
00:03:02,036 --> 00:03:04,240
Yeah, looking in the dictionary the other day,

64
00:03:04,325 --> 00:03:05,823
saw your picture sitting up in there.

65
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:08,103
Right next to "dumbass white chick".

66
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,380
That smells good.

67
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:19,142
I miss carbs.

68
00:03:19,246 --> 00:03:21,260
My friend Talisha tried no carbs.

69
00:03:21,465 --> 00:03:23,820
She ate bacon and eggs for a whole month.

70
00:03:23,906 --> 00:03:27,270
I'm talking like 5 dozen eggs and a whole pig a day.

71
00:03:27,356 --> 00:03:28,702
She lost 11 pounds.

72
00:03:28,845 --> 00:03:29,563
Shit works.

73
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:30,653
My sister does this thing

74
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:34,100
where they leave a cooler bag full of no carb food outside her house everyday.

75
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,541
She's lost 17 pounds.

76
00:03:35,606 --> 00:03:37,661
We should start this in this neighborhood.

77
00:03:37,747 --> 00:03:41,350
Call it the "I'm getting skinny 'cause come nigger stole my bag of food" diet.

78
00:03:41,426 --> 00:03:42,940
Talisha is still fat.

79
00:03:43,118 --> 00:03:44,260
She looks good.

80
00:03:44,337 --> 00:03:46,041
Then why Ronnie dumped her ass?

81
00:03:46,116 --> 00:03:49,760
'Cause he found out she was taking his money for little Ron and spending all shit for Shareek.

82
00:03:49,835 --> 00:03:52,302
Hey y'all! Why did my son got Adidas?

83
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,670
It's stupid to buy expensive shoes for a 3 year old.

84
00:03:54,717 --> 00:03:55,811
He'll outgrow them in a day.

85
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,223
You're  calling black people stupid?

86
00:03:57,326 --> 00:03:59,341
And lazy and they also steal.

87
00:03:59,717 --> 00:04:02,251
But sings and dances real good.

88
00:04:02,357 --> 00:04:03,683
White people steal.

89
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,613
Enron, World.com.

90
00:04:05,698 --> 00:04:07,303
They've been stealing billions of dollars,

91
00:04:07,346 --> 00:04:09,203
flush them through some overseas bank account.

92
00:04:09,265 --> 00:04:11,551
Then sit on the beach and count their money.

93
00:04:12,268 --> 00:04:15,251
Somebody's been listening to the good reverend Sharp.

94
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:19,382
Maybe black people need to start stealing a little bit bigger.

95
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:21,082
Maybe thought it so.

96
00:04:21,626 --> 00:04:24,522
That bag looks a little small.

97
00:04:30,215 --> 00:04:31,761
You did not just say that!

98
00:04:31,845 --> 00:04:35,813
Bitch, I can eyeball an ounce from outer space with my glasses cracked.

99
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:37,372
Give me.

100
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:45,060
Acting like you know, writing checks you ass can't cash.

101
00:04:45,138 --> 00:04:47,402
You never question Heylia's eyeballing.

102
00:04:47,566 --> 00:04:49,180
That's the Rain Man of weed right there.

103
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:49,802
Amen!

104
00:04:49,868 --> 00:04:52,382
I apologize. I'm still new at this. I stand corrected.

105
00:04:52,455 --> 00:04:53,013
Stand?

106
00:04:53,088 --> 00:04:54,611
You're on your knees corrected.

107
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:55,963
Getting  all beside herself,

108
00:04:56,027 --> 00:04:58,261
coming in my house telling about my business,

109
00:04:58,335 --> 00:04:59,842
you need to recognize...

110
00:04:59,927 --> 00:05:02,072
Alright, alright. Fine.

111
00:05:02,148 --> 00:05:04,520
I'm a bitch-ass... bitch.

112
00:05:06,216 --> 00:05:07,670
Give me a little respect.

113
00:05:07,776 --> 00:05:10,710
I'm the biggest game in the private community of Agrestic.

114
00:05:10,796 --> 00:05:13,741
Drugs sell themselves biscuit. You ain't shit.

115
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,482
You still ain't shit.

116
00:05:17,957 --> 00:05:19,171
How much you got there?

117
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:24,323
Take that crap off my money.

118
00:05:24,395 --> 00:05:25,791
You're not giving me a present.

119
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,613
You're paying me for weed.

120
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:31,191
Excuse me for trying to bring a little beauty into an ugly world.

121
00:05:34,706 --> 00:05:36,241
Oh shit!

122
00:05:36,656 --> 00:05:37,860
It's 2:30.

123
00:05:38,016 --> 00:05:40,272
Where are you rushing off to with your ass all on fire?

124
00:05:40,337 --> 00:05:42,072
Doctor Phil ain't on 'till 4.

125
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,530
Shane's  got his grief counselor.

126
00:05:45,397 --> 00:05:47,912
Oh right, I'm sorry.

127
00:05:47,997 --> 00:05:49,191
Wait, I'll walk you out.

128
00:05:49,657 --> 00:05:50,453
Damn!

129
00:05:50,546 --> 00:05:51,790
Can you imagine them?

130
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:55,000
Boy out, jogging with his daddy, having a good time,

131
00:05:55,126 --> 00:05:56,250
and boom!

132
00:05:56,618 --> 00:05:57,740
Daddy drops.

133
00:05:58,597 --> 00:05:59,922
That could fuck a kid up.

134
00:06:00,017 --> 00:06:02,021
You show me who ain't fucked up.

135
00:06:03,857 --> 00:06:05,211
Who wants some cornbread?

136
00:06:05,307 --> 00:06:06,211
Yeah.

137
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,470
You alright?

138
00:06:07,548 --> 00:06:08,391
I'm fine.

139
00:06:08,477 --> 00:06:09,441
I'm just late.

140
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:11,531
You're sure?

141
00:06:11,718 --> 00:06:14,872
Conrad, we do business, not personal.

142
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,812
You know I'm full service.

143
00:06:16,896 --> 00:06:18,721
Andy didn't tell you that when he hooked us up.

144
00:06:20,182 --> 00:06:23,845
I believe my brother-in-law's exact words were

145
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,303
"dude, meet the finest jit with the finest shit.".

146
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:28,624
Jit?

147
00:06:30,027 --> 00:06:31,151
I was quoting.

148
00:06:31,836 --> 00:06:32,951
I gotta go.

149
00:06:33,296 --> 00:06:34,121
Alright.

150
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,172
Drive safe.

151
00:06:35,746 --> 00:06:37,211
You know where I live at, right?

152
00:06:37,786 --> 00:06:39,651
I do. Bye.

153
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:53,980
What happened in the guest room?

154
00:06:54,555 --> 00:06:55,783
Ask Shane.

155
00:06:56,505 --> 00:06:58,301
I'm asking both of you.

156
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:04,802
I fell through the skylight but don't worry I'm okay.

157
00:07:05,428 --> 00:07:06,923
Turn the show back on!

158
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,803
There's a huge hole in the ceiling. What the hell were you doing up there?

159
00:07:09,877 --> 00:07:11,003
Lupita told him to get down.

160
00:07:11,088 --> 00:07:12,192
I tell him, Mrs.

161
00:07:12,278 --> 00:07:13,342
I didn't hear her.

162
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:16,681
Come on! Deaf girl on Douise Street could hear her.

163
00:07:17,097 --> 00:07:19,082
She's not deaf, she just talks weird.

164
00:07:19,168 --> 00:07:21,003
There's something wrong with her tongue.

165
00:07:21,095 --> 00:07:22,773
What? Who told you that?

166
00:07:22,857 --> 00:07:24,353
She's totally deaf.

167
00:07:24,435 --> 00:07:27,452
Dennis Kling says there is nothing wrong with her tongue.

168
00:07:27,528 --> 00:07:28,342
Hey!

169
00:07:29,006 --> 00:07:33,531
What do you mean? What ? Did they french kiss?

170
00:07:34,118 --> 00:07:35,252
Hey, Mrs. Botwin!

171
00:07:35,356 --> 00:07:36,822
Hey, Quinn! You want some chili?

172
00:07:36,928 --> 00:07:37,691
Nah, I'm good.

173
00:07:37,776 --> 00:07:38,861
That's right, Shane.

174
00:07:39,178 --> 00:07:40,702
They french kissed.

175
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:41,851
Who french kissed?

176
00:07:41,967 --> 00:07:44,271
Dennis Kling and Megan Beals.

177
00:07:44,368 --> 00:07:46,121
Oh! They did a whole lot more than...

178
00:07:46,186 --> 00:07:47,051
Quinn!

179
00:07:49,528 --> 00:07:50,902
Hey! How's your shoulder?

180
00:07:50,987 --> 00:07:52,461
I'm totally okay.

181
00:07:52,797 --> 00:07:55,911
Can I have the remote now? Please!

182
00:07:55,997 --> 00:07:57,493
You were here when he fell?

183
00:07:57,737 --> 00:08:01,343
Officially I was at Kim's house working on a science project.

184
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:02,453
Officially?

185
00:08:02,585 --> 00:08:04,271
Yeah, they were making out!

186
00:08:04,376 --> 00:08:05,773
But nothing naked.

187
00:08:05,826 --> 00:08:06,823
Shut up!

188
00:08:09,935 --> 00:08:10,762
Oh!

189
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,530
I gotta go out for a second.

190
00:08:12,675 --> 00:08:13,660
Where are you going?

191
00:08:13,755 --> 00:08:15,333
It's a neighborhood watch thing.

192
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:16,742
I'll be right back.

193
00:08:21,106 --> 00:08:22,012
Wanna fool around?

194
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:22,892
Sure.

195
00:08:44,307 --> 00:08:45,411
I told you!

196
00:08:45,545 --> 00:08:47,463
You can't miss the bear!

197
00:08:47,548 --> 00:08:49,120
I love this show!

198
00:08:52,438 --> 00:08:53,212
Boo!

199
00:08:54,057 --> 00:08:55,173
Christ!

200
00:08:55,655 --> 00:08:56,551
Josh!

201
00:08:56,778 --> 00:08:58,100
You need to relax.

202
00:08:58,846 --> 00:09:01,830
My husband died of an heart attack. You wanna orphan my kids?

203
00:09:02,016 --> 00:09:03,072
So what's up?

204
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:05,672
My guy went on this yoga retreat in Redlands.

205
00:09:05,737 --> 00:09:08,963
And he won't be back for a week, I was just wondering if you could help me out.

206
00:09:09,027 --> 00:09:10,680
He didn't take care of you before he left?

207
00:09:10,748 --> 00:09:14,492
They've been playing Winged Migration at the Plex for the midnight show all week.

208
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:18,651
Wiped me out. Shit hasn't gone this fast since the Passion of the Christ.

209
00:09:19,328 --> 00:09:22,553
People got stoned for the Passion of the Christ?

210
00:09:23,388 --> 00:09:24,831
That's disturbing.

211
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,052
That's not as disturbing as watching it not stoned.

212
00:09:27,127 --> 00:09:29,983
Religion my ass, it's a straight up snuff film.

213
00:09:30,038 --> 00:09:31,642
Why don't you take the week off?

214
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:36,533
that just goes so against my christian work ethic, Mrs. B.

215
00:09:36,656 --> 00:09:38,791
Come on, help me out. I'd do it for you.

216
00:09:38,857 --> 00:09:40,231
I don't need you to.

217
00:09:41,367 --> 00:09:43,051
My guy doesn't do yoga.

218
00:09:43,145 --> 00:09:43,991
Cash.

219
00:09:45,108 --> 00:09:47,260
- Josh!
- Come on!

220
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,403
I was at the orthodontist the other week

221
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,772
and I heard all about Shane's over-bike.

222
00:09:51,898 --> 00:09:54,880
It's gotta be costing some serious green.

223
00:09:58,846 --> 00:10:00,182
You're gonna play by the rules?

224
00:10:00,256 --> 00:10:03,651
One of your own kind, deal to your own kind.

225
00:10:03,707 --> 00:10:07,363
I'm putting the love in my glove.

226
00:10:09,878 --> 00:10:12,462
Listen, you stay away from my customer base,

227
00:10:12,527 --> 00:10:14,000
you don't deal to kids.

228
00:10:14,637 --> 00:10:15,863
Are we clear?

229
00:10:16,397 --> 00:10:17,533
They're too young to bleed,

230
00:10:17,605 --> 00:10:18,690
they're too young for weed.

231
00:10:18,747 --> 00:10:19,542
No grass in the field,

232
00:10:19,608 --> 00:10:21,411
no grass will they yield.

233
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,090
You're a poet.

234
00:10:23,188 --> 00:10:24,461
You know it!

235
00:10:27,388 --> 00:10:29,150
It's getting late, you want a ride home?

236
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:33,370
No, I'll be good, it's the suburb, safe to walk the streets at night and all that.

237
00:10:34,715 --> 00:10:35,503
Wow.

238
00:10:36,578 --> 00:10:38,762
You should take it easy with the lattés, Mrs. B.

239
00:10:38,827 --> 00:10:41,691
Don't kid yourself, caffeine is a serious drug.

240
00:10:41,817 --> 00:10:43,420
Go away now, Josh.

241
00:10:45,526 --> 00:10:46,681
Later, Mrs. B.

242
00:11:03,608 --> 00:11:06,303
Let's go, D. Come on, hassle out there!

243
00:11:10,927 --> 00:11:13,343
Ref, what's the matter with your whistle!

244
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:17,323
Well, technically, Nancy, ref can't call a foul.

245
00:11:17,406 --> 00:11:19,962
Shane was kicked by his own teammates.

246
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:21,270
Oh.

247
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,370
Look at Isabel go.

248
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:26,362
How is she doing with her nutrionist?

249
00:11:26,426 --> 00:11:27,550
Oh, fine.

250
00:11:27,847 --> 00:11:28,772
Fine.

251
00:11:29,877 --> 00:11:31,510
She lost 3 pounds.

252
00:11:31,598 --> 00:11:33,940
In just 4 months, good for her.

253
00:11:34,038 --> 00:11:36,493
She has a very slow metabolism.

254
00:11:36,727 --> 00:11:39,872
We're thinking on putting her on thyroid medication.

255
00:11:39,935 --> 00:11:43,763
Why she couldn't take after my side of the family? I will never know.

256
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:45,270
Did you see my kick?

257
00:11:45,547 --> 00:11:48,970
Yeah, I wanna see more running out there, Isabelly.

258
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:51,242
That's what burns the fat.

259
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:53,092
Kick was great, Isabel.

260
00:11:53,317 --> 00:11:55,040
Yes, it was.

261
00:11:55,136 --> 00:11:55,981
Yeah.

262
00:11:56,067 --> 00:11:58,291
I'm just gonna go get a drink.

263
00:11:58,975 --> 00:12:01,663
Water or diet soda only!

264
00:12:01,757 --> 00:12:03,122
You know, I love Dean

265
00:12:03,207 --> 00:12:05,323
but he has ruined my children.

266
00:12:05,487 --> 00:12:06,620
He  has.

267
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,290
Quinn has his asthma.

268
00:12:08,377 --> 00:12:11,630
Isabel has inherited his unfortunate build.

269
00:12:11,706 --> 00:12:12,980
Breaks my heart.

270
00:12:13,808 --> 00:12:15,693
But we all have our crosses to bear.

271
00:12:19,508 --> 00:12:21,523
Oh look, I think Shane is bleeding.

272
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:27,402
Ew! Shane just licked his own blood!

273
00:12:27,608 --> 00:12:28,942
Ew!

274
00:12:29,565 --> 00:12:31,860
Maybe he needs more iron in his diet.

275
00:12:32,438 --> 00:12:33,592
Here you go.

276
00:12:37,026 --> 00:12:37,831
Okay.

277
00:12:38,696 --> 00:12:40,602
Let the healing begin.

278
00:12:40,698 --> 00:12:42,111
Can we go home now?

279
00:12:42,206 --> 00:12:42,990
Please.

280
00:12:43,035 --> 00:12:44,511
It's not even half time.

281
00:12:44,607 --> 00:12:45,771
I don't feel well.

282
00:12:45,886 --> 00:12:47,500
I think I have rickets.

283
00:12:47,596 --> 00:12:49,810
No, you gotta tough it out, little man.

284
00:12:50,097 --> 00:12:51,432
See, that's what your father would have said.

285
00:12:51,457 --> 00:12:52,221
How about this?

286
00:12:52,307 --> 00:12:53,662
How about you relax

287
00:12:53,798 --> 00:12:54,980
and have a drink

288
00:12:55,056 --> 00:12:57,143
and sit out this quarter and

289
00:12:57,227 --> 00:13:00,131
you'll play again in the second half, okay?

290
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:01,960
Okay?

291
00:13:02,038 --> 00:13:02,850
Fine.

292
00:13:02,947 --> 00:13:03,941
Can I have fruit punch?

293
00:13:04,028 --> 00:13:05,723
You  can even have fruit punch.

294
00:13:06,346 --> 00:13:07,383
I love you.

295
00:13:08,805 --> 00:13:09,933
You know...

296
00:13:10,086 --> 00:13:12,373
From all the books I have read,

297
00:13:12,477 --> 00:13:18,201
you should really be encouraging Shane and Silas to talk about Juda's death.

298
00:13:18,305 --> 00:13:19,653
Or down the road,

299
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,640
you're looking at two very dysfunctional adults

300
00:13:22,786 --> 00:13:25,530
who will have trouble sustaining healthy relationships.

301
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:27,380
Celia.

302
00:13:27,616 --> 00:13:28,462
What?

303
00:13:28,568 --> 00:13:30,743
I had no idea you read books.

304
00:13:30,888 --> 00:13:31,550
Well...

305
00:13:31,637 --> 00:13:32,521
Hey, Nancy!

306
00:13:33,255 --> 00:13:34,182
How is it going?

307
00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:35,231
Douglas,

308
00:13:35,338 --> 00:13:38,421
do you know where your son Josh is right now?

309
00:13:38,496 --> 00:13:39,830
And what he's doing?

310
00:13:40,225 --> 00:13:41,530
Yeah, yeah.

311
00:13:41,598 --> 00:13:42,702
He's over there somewhere.

312
00:13:43,665 --> 00:13:44,910
And he just happens to be...

313
00:13:44,986 --> 00:13:46,082
Hey, Nancy, I was wondering if you..

314
00:13:46,145 --> 00:13:47,790
There are really nice stuff in here, Doug.

315
00:13:47,865 --> 00:13:48,313
Okay.

316
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,122
That's great.

317
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:50,562
It's kinda expensive but

318
00:13:50,647 --> 00:13:52,951
I promise you it's worth every penny.

319
00:13:53,147 --> 00:13:54,391
Really?

320
00:13:55,557 --> 00:13:58,880
Well, you haven't let me down yet, Nanc'. Thank you.

321
00:13:59,308 --> 00:14:00,541
You're welcome.

322
00:14:01,065 --> 00:14:02,410
Catch you later.

323
00:14:03,607 --> 00:14:05,220
I'll see you later, Doug.

324
00:14:05,597 --> 00:14:08,682
Oh... okay. Yeah, later.

325
00:14:11,716 --> 00:14:14,792
He's trying to find something nice for Dana. Her birthday's coming up.

326
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,432
Yeah, well, if he really wanted to do something nice for his wife,

327
00:14:17,495 --> 00:14:20,483
he'd ship that delinquent son of his off to military school.

328
00:14:20,557 --> 00:14:22,302
Will you look at that?

329
00:14:23,517 --> 00:14:26,703
The little scumbag sells drugs right on the playground.

330
00:14:26,775 --> 00:14:28,721
Nobody does anything about it.

331
00:14:29,815 --> 00:14:31,591
That's it! I'm gonna call the police.

332
00:14:31,678 --> 00:14:32,750
Oh please!

333
00:14:32,868 --> 00:14:34,740
Save your weekend minutes!

334
00:14:34,935 --> 00:14:38,112
The  kid will drop whatever he's got by the time he sees them marching through the sandbox.

335
00:14:38,186 --> 00:14:39,993
Which means nothing to arrest him for.

336
00:14:40,328 --> 00:14:42,450
Somebody's been watching Law & Order.

337
00:14:42,565 --> 00:14:43,680
Just the reruns.

338
00:14:43,745 --> 00:14:46,451
I've been finding Jerry Orbach oddly confident.

339
00:14:46,626 --> 00:14:48,653
You are such a brave widow.

340
00:14:50,028 --> 00:14:51,311
Alright, now, if you'll excuse me,

341
00:14:51,386 --> 00:14:53,711
I'm gonna chase that little fucker out of here.

342
00:14:54,347 --> 00:14:55,603
Oh! Did you hear?

343
00:14:56,006 --> 00:15:00,343
They found a 10 year old with marijuana in his lunch box yesterday.

344
00:15:00,948 --> 00:15:02,862
A 10 year old?

345
00:15:03,258 --> 00:15:04,482
Put that on your ankle.

346
00:15:04,565 --> 00:15:06,210
But I wanna play. We're short one.

347
00:15:06,298 --> 00:15:08,090
I guess I could go back in, coach.

348
00:15:08,138 --> 00:15:09,203
What?

349
00:15:09,448 --> 00:15:11,873
Oh, huh, Botwin. Huh...

350
00:15:12,217 --> 00:15:13,871
There's only a few minutes left in the half.

351
00:15:13,938 --> 00:15:15,221
It really wouldn't make a difference.

352
00:15:15,255 --> 00:15:19,460
And you, just sit there and ice that ankle so you can play after the break.

353
00:15:19,538 --> 00:15:20,883
You hear me, cowboy?

354
00:15:20,965 --> 00:15:24,770
The Hurricanes don't fully blow unless you are out there.

355
00:15:24,985 --> 00:15:28,212
Coach, did you mean to say that to Devon because

356
00:15:28,305 --> 00:15:32,321
I think the Hurricanes blow especially hard when I'm out there.

357
00:15:33,056 --> 00:15:34,510
You watch yourself, Botwin.

358
00:15:35,177 --> 00:15:37,123
Alright way to go Hurricanes.

359
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:43,250
Actually you should alternate cold and hot every 20 minutes.

360
00:15:43,335 --> 00:15:45,330
Don't even talk to me, weirdo.

361
00:15:45,425 --> 00:15:47,353
Fine. I was just trying to help.

362
00:15:47,426 --> 00:15:49,271
I don't need your help, lipstick.

363
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,510
Lipstick?

364
00:15:50,637 --> 00:15:53,412
Your fruit punch lipstick. Fruit punch!

365
00:15:53,508 --> 00:15:56,191
It's perfect: fruit for the fruit!

366
00:15:56,338 --> 00:15:58,112
Or are you just pretending it's blood?

367
00:15:58,218 --> 00:16:00,600
'Cause we all know now that you love the taste of blood.

368
00:16:00,705 --> 00:16:02,732
Is that it, vampire?

369
00:16:02,905 --> 00:16:04,380
Okay, I’m confused.

370
00:16:04,487 --> 00:16:07,672
Am I weirdo, lipstick, fruit punch or vampire?

371
00:16:07,746 --> 00:16:10,993
You really need to pick an insult name and stick to it.

372
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,901
How about orphan boy?

373
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:18,503
I'm going to kill you!

374
00:16:18,616 --> 00:16:20,241
You little freak!

375
00:16:22,497 --> 00:16:23,670
Shane...

376
00:16:24,907 --> 00:16:27,501
You are so dead!

377
00:16:28,407 --> 00:16:31,820
Devon, honey, you really need to watch where you're going.

378
00:16:32,107 --> 00:16:34,603
Well, it's never gonna happen at my house.

379
00:16:34,966 --> 00:16:38,852
My mom's probably got like spy cameras in the light fixtures.

380
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:40,191
Come on!

381
00:16:40,468 --> 00:16:42,002
You think I'm kidding?

382
00:16:43,047 --> 00:16:47,443
This is a woman who put one of those stuffed teddy bear nanny cams in the pantry

383
00:16:47,517 --> 00:16:50,101
so she can see if Isabel was sneaking food.

384
00:16:57,345 --> 00:16:59,903
I am so dead! I am so dead!

385
00:16:59,996 --> 00:17:01,121
Is he coming?

386
00:17:02,075 --> 00:17:04,022
There is no one chasing you, Shane.

387
00:17:04,977 --> 00:17:07,513
Are you wearing lipstick?

388
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:09,172
That's not lipstick, it's fruit punch.

389
00:17:09,277 --> 00:17:11,591
I throw a can of soda at Devon Rensler.

390
00:17:11,725 --> 00:17:13,030
That was stupid.

391
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,803
He called me orphan boy.

392
00:17:14,877 --> 00:17:15,822
He's a fuckwad.

393
00:17:15,907 --> 00:17:16,663
Did you hit him?

394
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:17,821
No, just grazed him.

395
00:17:17,897 --> 00:17:19,560
Oh! It's bad!

396
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:21,072
You can't miss the bear!

397
00:17:21,256 --> 00:17:22,173
What bear?

398
00:17:22,218 --> 00:17:23,512
I missed the bear!

399
00:17:23,645 --> 00:17:26,483
The shot was nowhere his optimum kill zone.

400
00:17:26,548 --> 00:17:27,922
What are you talking about?

401
00:17:27,998 --> 00:17:29,241
Don't you watch Bear Hunt?

402
00:17:29,307 --> 00:17:30,762
On the Wilderness Channel?

403
00:17:30,878 --> 00:17:32,201
Somehow I've missed it.

404
00:17:32,278 --> 00:17:34,533
It's only the best show in the history of television.

405
00:17:34,607 --> 00:17:38,071
Every week, these guys with gun racks and their big old monster trucks.

406
00:17:38,155 --> 00:17:39,761
They go out and they kill a bear.

407
00:17:39,876 --> 00:17:40,682
That's horrible!

408
00:17:40,758 --> 00:17:42,211
- No, it's so awesome.
- He's right!

409
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:45,503
He's got a big enough gun to get the job done.

410
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,093
Oh and tell her about CGS!

411
00:17:47,186 --> 00:17:48,712
Shane! You're gonna wet yourself!

412
00:17:48,797 --> 00:17:49,992
Shut up! You're just as into it.

413
00:17:50,056 --> 00:17:50,751
CGS?

414
00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:53,193
Carter Grizzli Suck. He's the host.

415
00:17:53,268 --> 00:17:54,363
At the end of each show, he's got...

416
00:17:54,446 --> 00:17:56,082
He has the head of the bear that they shot that week.

417
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:59,580
Right, right. And he leaves you with these, like, wise parting words like

418
00:17:59,718 --> 00:18:01,362
"You can't miss the bear!

419
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:03,941
Or he's gonna turn around and rip you open

420
00:18:04,018 --> 00:18:06,840
like a present from your mamma at Christmas morning."

421
00:18:07,428 --> 00:18:09,063
Okay, we are breaking up.

422
00:18:09,176 --> 00:18:10,003
Come on!

423
00:18:10,745 --> 00:18:12,702
Think of the time this will save us on foreplay.

424
00:18:12,797 --> 00:18:15,771
Just whisper "shoot me in the optimum kill zone"...

425
00:18:15,868 --> 00:18:16,831
I'll be good to go.

426
00:18:16,926 --> 00:18:19,441
I could whisper "linoleum" and you'd be good to go.

427
00:18:19,548 --> 00:18:21,021
Are you finally gonna do it?

428
00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:23,341
Thank God! He's been going crazy!

429
00:18:23,425 --> 00:18:25,282
Shane! Shut the fuck up!

430
00:18:56,036 --> 00:18:56,833
Doug...

431
00:18:56,908 --> 00:18:59,151
Jesus, Nancy, you weren't kidding, this stuff is primo.

432
00:18:59,586 --> 00:19:00,713
You wanna climb in?

433
00:19:00,818 --> 00:19:03,611
Unless you wanna go back to buying ditch weed from your housekeeper's cousin,

434
00:19:03,706 --> 00:19:07,442
I suggest you clue away the pipe, the open bag of pot and get your head over your ass.

435
00:19:07,487 --> 00:19:08,540
What are you thinking?

436
00:19:08,618 --> 00:19:09,483
What?

437
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:14,463
You're on the goddamn city council. What if someone like Celia walked by?

438
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,343
She's such a bitch!

439
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:19,720
Great tits but a raging bitch!

440
00:19:20,386 --> 00:19:22,112
Her husband's boning the tennis pro.

441
00:19:22,188 --> 00:19:23,162
The Asian girl?

442
00:19:23,717 --> 00:19:25,662
She loved him long time.

443
00:19:25,877 --> 00:19:27,830
Doug, she's from Anaheim.

444
00:19:27,905 --> 00:19:31,250
Not Bangkok. She can't shoot tennis balls out of her twat.

445
00:19:31,326 --> 00:19:34,591
Last week, she stuck the end of a racket up Dean's ass when he was blowing her.

446
00:19:34,676 --> 00:19:36,151
He said it felt unbelievable.

447
00:19:36,226 --> 00:19:37,453
But you know if you ask me,

448
00:19:37,528 --> 00:19:40,323
any guy who lets anything up there is at least part fag.

449
00:19:41,656 --> 00:19:43,112
How do you know all this?

450
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:44,760
He's in the poker game.

451
00:19:45,746 --> 00:19:48,162
And he just shared it with you?

452
00:19:48,247 --> 00:19:50,372
He was losing, drank too much.

453
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:56,093
Did Juda ever say anything about our sex life at these games?

454
00:19:56,168 --> 00:19:57,330
No, no.

455
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,113
The guys who still have sex with their wives

456
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,982
usually don't wanna jinx it by saying something out loud.

457
00:20:02,778 --> 00:20:05,472
It was a great guy, Nanc'. I miss him a lot.

458
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:07,601
Yeah, me too.

459
00:20:07,765 --> 00:20:11,203
If only he had lived long enough for me to stick foreign objects up his ass...

460
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:13,081
I never even got a finger up there.

461
00:20:13,717 --> 00:20:14,983
You're an amazing lady.

462
00:20:15,068 --> 00:20:16,331
And you're an idiot.

463
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:17,800
Air out the van.

464
00:20:17,896 --> 00:20:19,573
And keep your smoke private.

465
00:20:19,728 --> 00:20:20,713
You hear me?

466
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:24,131
Yeah, I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking. We're cool?

467
00:20:24,378 --> 00:20:26,133
We're cool when you pay me.

468
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:31,441
Now we're cool.

469
00:20:32,646 --> 00:20:34,411
Hey, hey, hey! I was just getting into that!

470
00:20:34,996 --> 00:20:36,842
You know, it's all about textures this fall.

471
00:20:37,058 --> 00:20:38,553
Give my love to Dana.

472
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:40,001
Right, right, will do.

473
00:20:40,085 --> 00:20:44,493
Hey, Dana wants to either call about taking a class of vegetable gardening or vegetable cooking.

474
00:20:44,546 --> 00:20:45,530
Something with vegetables.

475
00:20:45,608 --> 00:20:47,261
Vegetable carving maybe.

476
00:20:48,588 --> 00:20:51,382
Excuse me, ma'am, have you heard the good news about Jesus?

477
00:20:52,106 --> 00:20:53,682
You made me a promise, you little shit.

478
00:20:53,746 --> 00:20:54,842
Hey! Take it easy!

479
00:20:54,907 --> 00:20:56,090
I won't sneak up on you anymore.

480
00:20:56,156 --> 00:20:59,972
I just heard a 10 year old got busted, a 10 year old, you fucking liar!

481
00:21:00,045 --> 00:21:01,801
The kid told me he was 37.

482
00:21:01,895 --> 00:21:03,533
You promised me no kids.

483
00:21:03,608 --> 00:21:04,982
Yeah, but they all want it.

484
00:21:05,068 --> 00:21:06,453
And they cry if you say no.

485
00:21:06,537 --> 00:21:07,153
Josh...

486
00:21:07,216 --> 00:21:08,262
I just sold him shake.

487
00:21:08,336 --> 00:21:09,850
He's 10.

488
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:13,261
Look, when you opened shop here, I was totally cool with you, you know.

489
00:21:13,327 --> 00:21:16,473
And you took away a lot of my parent business but I let it go.

490
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,671
It's not okay to sell to little kids.

491
00:21:18,758 --> 00:21:20,113
Let their parents worry about it.

492
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,922
I'm selling to whoever's buying, okay?

493
00:21:22,025 --> 00:21:22,913
You're not!

494
00:21:27,025 --> 00:21:28,171
No, you're not.

495
00:21:28,815 --> 00:21:29,852
No?

496
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:31,942
What are you gonna do? You're gonna tell on me?

497
00:21:32,036 --> 00:21:34,720
My dad is over there getting baked in the minivan.

498
00:21:35,195 --> 00:21:38,050
He'll just be pissed that I was holding out on him.

499
00:21:42,088 --> 00:21:43,410
Don't worry...

500
00:21:43,997 --> 00:21:46,471
I will never sell to Shane, okay?

501
00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:48,243
You're a kid.

502
00:21:48,327 --> 00:21:50,103
You're just a stupid irresponsible kid.

503
00:21:50,187 --> 00:21:51,620
And you're a hypocrite.

504
00:21:53,238 --> 00:21:56,200
"Keep kids off drugs" cries the pot-dealing mom.

505
00:21:56,288 --> 00:21:57,872
But you know, if it gets you through the night...

506
00:21:57,946 --> 00:21:59,300
good for you, Nanc'.

507
00:21:59,408 --> 00:22:00,652
I'll see you around.

508
00:22:03,467 --> 00:22:07,562
Can we go now? I hate soccer and Devon Rensler called me orphan boy.

509
00:22:07,657 --> 00:22:09,330
Devon Rensler is a fuckwad.

510
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:10,310
Get in the car.

511
00:22:13,455 --> 00:22:14,402
Are you two coming?

512
00:22:14,496 --> 00:22:15,532
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

513
00:22:25,336 --> 00:22:27,371
Can we have sex in your house?

514
00:22:30,035 --> 00:22:32,223
So you guys really think you're ready?

515
00:22:32,575 --> 00:22:33,462
Yeah.

516
00:22:33,697 --> 00:22:35,220
I've tortured him enough.

517
00:22:36,566 --> 00:22:39,743
I mean, we've been going out for almost 3 months already.

518
00:22:40,606 --> 00:22:42,343
Whole three months...

519
00:22:42,498 --> 00:22:43,820
But I trust him.

520
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,732
And I think he loves me.

521
00:22:47,295 --> 00:22:50,521
I think you're right about that but you guys are only 15.

522
00:22:51,195 --> 00:22:53,783
Mom! Mom!

523
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:02,191
Shane!

524
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:05,272
We're up on the roof. Who called?

525
00:23:05,418 --> 00:23:08,060
Quinn's mom. She's on her way over.

526
00:23:08,295 --> 00:23:09,251
Great.

527
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:10,933
Go warn your brother.

528
00:23:11,077 --> 00:23:12,002
Silas!

529
00:23:12,088 --> 00:23:13,452
She's gonna make you swear

530
00:23:13,536 --> 00:23:17,922
that Silas and I are never in a room alone without
the door open and the feet on the floor.

531
00:23:18,007 --> 00:23:20,223
She's such an uptight prude.

532
00:23:21,355 --> 00:23:23,911
No wonder my dad is screwing Helen Chen.

533
00:23:25,998 --> 00:23:27,562
You know about that?

534
00:23:27,747 --> 00:23:29,463
I had my suspicions.

535
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,270
You just confirmed them.

536
00:23:31,318 --> 00:23:32,813
Oh shit.

537
00:23:32,918 --> 00:23:37,100
Look, Mrs. Botwin, I think you're really cool but Silas and I are ready.

538
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:38,603
You say that but

539
00:23:38,757 --> 00:23:39,953
you don't know.

540
00:23:40,068 --> 00:23:41,562
You never know.

541
00:23:41,968 --> 00:23:43,902
When I had sex with my last boyfriend...

542
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:45,660
Sex with your last boyfriend?

543
00:23:45,748 --> 00:23:46,841
Yeah.

544
00:23:47,608 --> 00:23:50,062
What? Did you think we were virgins?

545
00:23:51,588 --> 00:23:52,860
I'm climbing down.

546
00:23:54,207 --> 00:23:55,420
See you in the house.

547
00:23:58,776 --> 00:24:00,752
Oh check it out.

548
00:24:01,686 --> 00:24:04,180
Mr. Wells has a new boy toy.

549
00:24:05,188 --> 00:24:07,002
He... what?

550
00:24:07,116 --> 00:24:08,953
I didn't know he had an old one.

551
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:12,912
Yeah, that guy Raoul from the security patrol but they broke up a while ago.

552
00:24:12,998 --> 00:24:14,272
Hand me the binoculars.

553
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:21,500
Oh! Oh no way!

554
00:24:22,606 --> 00:24:24,313
I know that guy.

555
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:27,980
His dad would so freak if he knew that Josh was gay. This is so funny.

556
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,082
Josh?

557
00:24:29,545 --> 00:24:31,123
Josh Wilson, Josh?

558
00:24:31,206 --> 00:24:32,181
Yeah.

559
00:24:34,888 --> 00:24:36,843
I think he's a pot-dealer or something.

560
00:24:44,587 --> 00:24:45,962
I know nothing.

561
00:24:56,045 --> 00:24:58,611
If it's a girl scouts, get the mint cookies.

562
00:25:01,257 --> 00:25:02,093
Yes?

563
00:25:02,695 --> 00:25:03,971
Just one second.

564
00:25:06,058 --> 00:25:07,722
Wait! Who are you?

565
00:25:07,998 --> 00:25:10,462
- I'll just be a second.
- Excuse me!

566
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:13,813
Your dad may not care about the dealing

567
00:25:13,885 --> 00:25:16,161
but from what I'm hearing this could really upset him.

568
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:17,991
Okay. You win.

569
00:25:18,088 --> 00:25:19,730
No kids, ever, I promise.

570
00:25:19,805 --> 00:25:21,452
Your promises aren't worth much.

571
00:25:21,536 --> 00:25:22,981
I swear on my life, okay?

572
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:25,863
Just... you can't say anything, you don't know what my dad is really like.

573
00:25:25,938 --> 00:25:26,632
No, I don't.

574
00:25:26,727 --> 00:25:27,713
What's going on?

575
00:25:27,795 --> 00:25:29,501
You think you know a person...

576
00:25:29,627 --> 00:25:31,251
He said he was 23.

577
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:33,343
Promise me you're not gonna say anything, please Mrs. B.

578
00:25:33,418 --> 00:25:34,731
I'll think about it.

579
00:25:35,026 --> 00:25:36,651
- What does that mean?
- This is my house!

580
00:25:36,748 --> 00:25:38,042
- My house!
- What does that mean?

581
00:25:38,107 --> 00:25:39,150
See you around, Josh.

582
00:25:40,977 --> 00:25:42,373
See you in church.

583
00:25:43,337 --> 00:25:44,883
I know everything.

584
00:25:45,056 --> 00:25:47,622
I read her diary.

585
00:25:47,958 --> 00:25:50,160
You read her diary?

586
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:51,913
They're going to have sex.

587
00:25:52,028 --> 00:25:52,853
Here.

588
00:25:53,656 --> 00:25:54,851
I brought you something

589
00:25:59,637 --> 00:26:01,653
It has a camera in it.

590
00:26:02,825 --> 00:26:05,601
Just skip it into Silas' room.

591
00:26:06,577 --> 00:26:09,271
Flip this switch right under the tail here.

592
00:26:11,716 --> 00:26:16,322
I think Silas would notice if a big pink bear suddenly showed in his room.

593
00:26:16,387 --> 00:26:19,443
And I'm not gonna spy on my kids.

594
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:21,160
Celia, I trust them.

595
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:24,011
Please! They're all liars and sneaks.

596
00:26:24,258 --> 00:26:29,131
And it is our job to discover what they're up to and stop it.

597
00:26:29,568 --> 00:26:32,512
Are you really that naive?

598
00:26:33,668 --> 00:26:37,982
I'm beginning to think I am extremely naive.

599
00:26:38,187 --> 00:26:39,310
Take the bear.

600
00:26:39,417 --> 00:26:40,412
I'm not gonna take the bear.

601
00:26:40,497 --> 00:26:41,933
- Take the bear.
- No!

602
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:43,522
Okay. Fine.

603
00:26:43,617 --> 00:26:44,400
Fine.

604
00:26:44,485 --> 00:26:46,070
Just promise me,

605
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:47,360
mother to mother,

606
00:26:48,047 --> 00:26:52,730
that my daughter and your son will not have sex under this roof.

607
00:26:52,906 --> 00:26:56,062
I know that it's hard for you to understand because you have boys

608
00:26:56,136 --> 00:26:59,653
but I don't want Quinn turning into some little slut.

609
00:26:59,747 --> 00:27:04,083
Like that deaf girl down on Douise Street that gave fellatio to Dennis Kling.

610
00:27:05,977 --> 00:27:08,130
- Promise me!
- Fine! Fine!

611
00:27:08,238 --> 00:27:11,081
Not under my roof, you have my word as a mother.

612
00:27:11,246 --> 00:27:12,192
Thank you.

613
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:13,712
Pizza's here.

614
00:27:14,236 --> 00:27:15,480
Where is my change?

615
00:27:16,147 --> 00:27:16,981
Here.

616
00:27:21,415 --> 00:27:23,191
Oh look Silas!

617
00:27:23,417 --> 00:27:26,621
Look at that cute stuffed bear on the table.

618
00:27:26,726 --> 00:27:29,101
We used to have one just like it in our pantry.

619
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:31,802
What happened to that bear, mom? I miss that bear.

620
00:27:32,006 --> 00:27:34,452
You can't miss the bear!

621
00:27:34,536 --> 00:27:37,962
Oh that is the bear from the pantry.

622
00:27:38,467 --> 00:27:40,670
I was just showing it to Nancy.

623
00:27:41,777 --> 00:27:42,892
Why?

624
00:27:43,706 --> 00:27:44,800
Why?

625
00:27:45,548 --> 00:27:49,390
I've been thinking of investing in one of those "make your own bear" franchise at the mall.

626
00:27:49,495 --> 00:27:52,143
Oh right, well, are you gonna keep him?

627
00:27:52,225 --> 00:27:56,240
Because I'd love to put him in my room.

628
00:27:56,337 --> 00:27:57,431
Give me the bear.

629
00:27:57,617 --> 00:27:58,863
Give me the bear.

630
00:27:59,026 --> 00:28:00,301
He's all yours.

631
00:28:08,318 --> 00:28:09,882
Of course, he's not here today.

632
00:28:10,465 --> 00:28:12,171
He knows he'd get his ass kicked.

633
00:28:28,765 --> 00:28:30,153
Quit it! Quit it!

634
00:28:30,197 --> 00:28:33,291
I think pink is really your colour, you fuckwad!

635
00:28:33,486 --> 00:28:35,253
Who's fruit punch now?

636
00:28:45,296 --> 00:28:47,213
Shane goes on a paint rampage,

637
00:28:47,318 --> 00:28:48,642
gets suspended.

638
00:28:48,815 --> 00:28:52,360
Two of you ditch school to fuck in my guest room.

639
00:28:53,418 --> 00:28:55,322
I've got everything under control.

640
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:59,050
Don't you see? Technically we're not under your roof.

641
00:29:01,898 --> 00:29:02,932
See?

642
00:29:18,658 --> 00:29:19,543
Hey!

643
00:29:27,877 --> 00:29:28,691
Come on.

644
00:29:33,795 --> 00:29:34,921
It's alright.

645
00:29:37,405 --> 00:29:41,803
Heylia. Bring out that pie you made last night, the white lady's having a time over here.

646
00:29:41,877 --> 00:29:47,273
Get her skinny ass in here and get her own damn pie. Slave days is over.

647
00:30:17,568 --> 00:30:18,471
Dean!

648
00:30:19,606 --> 00:30:20,523
Come on!

649
00:30:22,295 --> 00:30:23,143
Dean!

650
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:29,581
Put it in! Put it in!

651
00:30:29,908 --> 00:30:31,153
Oh my God!

652
00:30:43,918 --> 00:30:46,121
That little cunt!

653
00:30:49,816 --> 00:30:52,040
I should have had an abortion.

654
00:30:56,348 --> 00:31:00,440
