1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,103
You're cute.

2
00:00:02,196 --> 00:00:03,553
Previously on Weeds.

3
00:00:03,925 --> 00:00:06,760
We just mostly hang out,
get high.

4
00:00:06,853 --> 00:00:08,153
You're an idiot. Fuck you!

5
00:00:08,225 --> 00:00:10,275
That was dad's lighter!
He gave it to me!

6
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,589
What's wrong with you?

7
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,707
Give me your fucking bag!

8
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:16,893
I just got ripped off by some
campus cop at valley State.

9
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:18,836
Then you're gonna need my protection
a lot more than you think.

10
00:00:18,867 --> 00:00:20,492
Your rent-a-cop is
a dealer himself.

11
00:00:20,522 --> 00:00:21,425
Nice haircut!

12
00:00:21,499 --> 00:00:22,533
It's a wig.

13
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:25,194
Right, the cancer thing.

14
00:00:25,246 --> 00:00:26,093
Can I pet it?

15
00:00:26,187 --> 00:00:27,762
- I love you.
- What the hell are you doing?

16
00:00:27,797 --> 00:00:28,991
How can I make it up to you?

17
00:00:29,026 --> 00:00:30,392
Here. This is yours.

18
00:00:30,496 --> 00:00:32,002
I didn't realize who you were.

19
00:00:32,108 --> 00:00:34,302
I mean I knew who you were,
I just didn't know

20
00:00:34,337 --> 00:00:36,802
who you were. I'm so sorry.

21
00:01:35,787 --> 00:01:37,401
You feel like a big man?

22
00:01:37,546 --> 00:01:38,292
Hmm?

23
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,212
All macho and shit?

24
00:01:41,265 --> 00:01:42,892
She got jacked for
like 14 grand...

25
00:01:42,928 --> 00:01:44,720
She... got jacked...

26
00:01:44,816 --> 00:01:47,462
for 14 grand. Not us. Not me.

27
00:01:47,517 --> 00:01:49,691
See, I've got my shit
tucked away safe.

28
00:01:50,816 --> 00:01:53,192
Boy, it wasn't your
job to defend her.

29
00:01:53,286 --> 00:01:55,611
That man was just
protecting what was his.

30
00:01:55,707 --> 00:01:56,983
Just like any man would.

31
00:01:57,088 --> 00:01:59,212
But see,
you got to go up in there

32
00:01:59,318 --> 00:02:01,793
and beat the shit out of him
with your little buddies.

33
00:02:01,826 --> 00:02:03,442
For what? For her?

34
00:02:03,727 --> 00:02:05,810
So she think you're a big man?

35
00:02:05,888 --> 00:02:07,542
Big strong man!

36
00:02:07,776 --> 00:02:09,720
You're her fucking errand boy.

37
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:13,723
Gonna fuck my shit up after all
the years I've sacrificed for you,

38
00:02:13,816 --> 00:02:15,231
for Vanita, for everybody.

39
00:02:15,317 --> 00:02:16,983
For what?
For somebody who ain't even family?

40
00:02:17,018 --> 00:02:19,022
Somebody who's too
hard-headed to listen,

41
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,833
don't know what the hell she doing.
Growing too big too fast.

42
00:02:21,867 --> 00:02:25,113
But no, she's jumping there before
she even know the lay of the land.

43
00:02:25,148 --> 00:02:26,380
Yeah, but see, there you are.

44
00:02:26,418 --> 00:02:27,460
With a big old net,

45
00:02:27,508 --> 00:02:29,652
waiting to catch her
just in case she fall.

46
00:02:29,688 --> 00:02:30,961
She gonna fall all right.

47
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:34,862
She gonna fall and land her lilly
white ass right on top of your head.

48
00:02:34,917 --> 00:02:36,861
Hell! On top of my head!

49
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:40,233
Grind all our shit
into the ground.

50
00:02:40,746 --> 00:02:42,740
- I'm sorry.
- Yes, you are.

51
00:02:43,075 --> 00:02:44,583
And you ain't gonna
see her no more.

52
00:02:44,617 --> 00:02:46,513
She come over here,
you disappear.

53
00:02:46,655 --> 00:02:49,693
You will have no contact
with her whatsoever.

54
00:02:49,788 --> 00:02:52,942
I mean, you even see a white girl on
television, you change the channel

55
00:02:52,976 --> 00:02:55,873
or I swear for God I will
freeze you out so cold

56
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,672
you'll have to carry your ass
to the North Pole to defrost.

57
00:02:58,706 --> 00:02:59,791
You hear me?

58
00:03:01,246 --> 00:03:02,762
I hear you.

59
00:03:08,418 --> 00:03:09,222
Heylia.

60
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:12,063
I'm warning you, little girl.
I'm in no mood.

61
00:03:12,346 --> 00:03:13,240
What you want?

62
00:03:13,336 --> 00:03:16,380
- I think I'm in labor.
- My grandbaby?

63
00:03:16,475 --> 00:03:18,133
My grandbaby's coming.

64
00:03:18,277 --> 00:03:22,221
Lord! That's... Girl!
Girl, let's go! Get my bag!

65
00:03:23,677 --> 00:03:25,091
- And?
- No biting.

66
00:03:25,188 --> 00:03:26,991
I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.

67
00:03:27,085 --> 00:03:28,653
I'm not gonna bite anyone!

68
00:03:28,747 --> 00:03:30,222
Under any circumstances,
no matter what,

69
00:03:30,255 --> 00:03:33,121
no matter how provoked or upset you
might be, there'll be no biting.

70
00:03:33,157 --> 00:03:35,103
Stop it! I'm not gonna bite.

71
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,370
Thank you.

72
00:03:36,468 --> 00:03:39,082
Listen to me:
thank you for not biting.

73
00:03:40,116 --> 00:03:41,720
You're welcome.

74
00:03:43,548 --> 00:03:45,202
Smartass.

75
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:48,791
You don't even know if
he's gonna be there.

76
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:49,363
Who?

77
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,022
That guy you like, Peter.

78
00:03:51,116 --> 00:03:52,453
Don't even know if I like him.

79
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:54,382
- He's creepy.
- He's not creepy.

80
00:03:54,475 --> 00:03:57,283
Yes, he is and he
smells like flea collar.

81
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,620
Why don't you go out,
we'll be late.

82
00:04:06,938 --> 00:04:08,450
Good clean fight. Clean!

83
00:04:08,506 --> 00:04:09,820
- No teeth.
- No teeth.

84
00:04:09,927 --> 00:04:11,240
Go get 'em.

85
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:19,183
-  Hey!
- Hi... Peter!

86
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,022
Hi, Peter!

87
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:24,292
- Nice to see you again.
- You too.

88
00:04:25,146 --> 00:04:26,571
I was hoping to hear from you.

89
00:04:26,607 --> 00:04:27,543
Yeah...

90
00:04:28,108 --> 00:04:30,621
I've been meaning to call,
I should have called.

91
00:04:31,518 --> 00:04:34,362
- You still have my number?
- I do. I have it.

92
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:35,780
I'll call you.

93
00:04:37,326 --> 00:04:39,222
We'll have fun.

94
00:04:54,608 --> 00:04:57,210
I guess Shane's
reputation preceeds him.

95
00:04:58,808 --> 00:05:01,642
Okay, I'm the celebrity
and you be the publicist.

96
00:05:01,826 --> 00:05:03,581
You're so hot!

97
00:05:03,776 --> 00:05:05,142
- Really?
- Yeah.

98
00:05:05,266 --> 00:05:06,590
You're so hot!

99
00:05:06,735 --> 00:05:09,061
Do I look hot like this?

100
00:05:09,207 --> 00:05:11,620
Yeah, you look really
hot like that.

101
00:05:13,678 --> 00:05:17,053
Mom, can Peggy sleep over?

102
00:05:17,155 --> 00:05:19,632
You know, she doesn't have
any of her overnight things.

103
00:05:19,668 --> 00:05:21,473
But see,
we have extra toothbrushes

104
00:05:21,617 --> 00:05:24,552
and tomorrow she can borrow
one of my Cindy outfits.

105
00:05:24,887 --> 00:05:26,301
Older tags are so on.

106
00:05:26,405 --> 00:05:27,673
You're so hot!

107
00:05:32,077 --> 00:05:34,092
You  have excellent
hair and you know it.

108
00:05:34,187 --> 00:05:35,752
It's an $8 haircut.

109
00:05:35,947 --> 00:05:37,312
It smells good.

110
00:05:37,408 --> 00:05:38,660
When did you smell my hair?

111
00:05:38,698 --> 00:05:39,861
At the restaurant.

112
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:42,860
There were overtones of
tomato sauce and garlic but

113
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:46,040
underneath it smelled
clean and leafy.

114
00:05:47,495 --> 00:05:50,093
Shit, that's my doorbell.
What time is it?

115
00:05:50,557 --> 00:05:51,971
A quarter after one.

116
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:56,260
Oh God, I gotta go.

117
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:58,592
- We're on for tomorrow?
- Yeah. Yeah, bye.

118
00:06:06,205 --> 00:06:08,153
- Mommy!
- Is this your son?

119
00:06:08,998 --> 00:06:10,500
Hi, mommy!

120
00:06:10,785 --> 00:06:11,773
What did you do?

121
00:06:11,887 --> 00:06:14,291
We caught him and his girlfriend
breaking into one of the modelhomes

122
00:06:14,326 --> 00:06:17,120
high on something,
we're guessing ecstasy.

123
00:06:17,368 --> 00:06:19,272
You told me you were
sleeping at Brian's.

124
00:06:19,307 --> 00:06:22,391
Oh I'm so thirsty. Do we have
grape soda? It has to be grape.

125
00:06:22,447 --> 00:06:23,863
N o.

126
00:06:23,965 --> 00:06:29,382
Officer, I will attend to this
in a grave and serious fashion.

127
00:06:30,305 --> 00:06:32,442
You know,
taking ecstasy is like

128
00:06:32,537 --> 00:06:34,593
taking ice scream scoops
out of the brain.

129
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:38,142
Yeah... Where is Megan?

130
00:06:38,287 --> 00:06:41,292
She's out in the car with my partner...
being very difficult.

131
00:06:41,326 --> 00:06:43,030
Not responding to questions.

132
00:06:43,178 --> 00:06:46,262
She's deaf.

133
00:06:46,638 --> 00:06:48,722
- Seriously?
- Told you!

134
00:06:50,186 --> 00:06:53,360
- Do you need her address?
- Yes, ma'am, please. Thank you.

135
00:06:55,935 --> 00:06:57,501
Thank you so much for

136
00:06:58,158 --> 00:07:02,150
bringing my son home, officer,
and I promise you this will never ever

137
00:07:02,616 --> 00:07:03,703
happen again.

138
00:07:03,845 --> 00:07:06,363
It'd better not. You know, this is a
very critical time in your child's life.

139
00:07:06,395 --> 00:07:09,431
His... his brain
is developping.

140
00:07:10,465 --> 00:07:13,210
You don't want it all hollowed
out by the time he's 20.

141
00:07:13,346 --> 00:07:15,752
I certainly don't, officer.

142
00:07:16,608 --> 00:07:19,162
- Good night.
- Ice scream scoops.

143
00:07:22,486 --> 00:07:23,850
This is...

144
00:07:24,182 --> 00:07:28,755
This is the softest thing I've
ever felt in my entire life.

145
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:31,583
Enjoy it because

146
00:07:31,913 --> 00:07:38,304
when you come down, I'm going to
make your life unbelievably hard.

147
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:02,530
Is that for you?

148
00:08:03,518 --> 00:08:04,513
Yeah.

149
00:08:04,646 --> 00:08:06,353
See? Andrew Botwin.

150
00:08:06,448 --> 00:08:09,732
That's a letter for me 'cause
I'm someone who gets mail.

151
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:16,283
What?

152
00:08:23,027 --> 00:08:25,243
They wanna send me
to Iraq, Lupita.

153
00:08:26,277 --> 00:08:27,071
Bye!

154
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,590
You're so hot!

155
00:08:41,638 --> 00:08:43,340
Oh good Christ!

156
00:08:54,227 --> 00:08:55,643
They found me, man!

157
00:08:56,115 --> 00:08:56,811
Bummer!

158
00:08:58,405 --> 00:08:59,353
Who found you?

159
00:08:59,448 --> 00:09:02,011
The fucking army! That's who.

160
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,402
Years ago, in Colorado,

161
00:09:06,206 --> 00:09:07,523
I was trying to

162
00:09:08,927 --> 00:09:12,060
impress a lady friend and
there was jägermeister

163
00:09:12,257 --> 00:09:15,581
and I signed up for the army
reserves then I forgot about it.

164
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,123
Now, I get a letter

165
00:09:17,226 --> 00:09:20,260
saying I gotta report for
duty or face military prison.

166
00:09:20,366 --> 00:09:22,543
I don't...
How did they find me?

167
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,783
I mean, I'm off the grid.
I'm "Off-the-grid Andy".

168
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,940
Well, you got busted
for possession.

169
00:09:28,037 --> 00:09:29,983
And now you're
"In-the-system Andy".

170
00:09:30,077 --> 00:09:33,042
Well, you gotta help me, man.
You're on the city council, right?

171
00:09:33,075 --> 00:09:34,631
Tell them that my city needs me.

172
00:09:35,247 --> 00:09:36,433
Needs you for what?

173
00:09:36,517 --> 00:09:38,081
I don't know for... for...

174
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:39,312
planting trees.

175
00:09:39,785 --> 00:09:42,530
Starting a youth program
for troubled teenage girls.

176
00:09:42,686 --> 00:09:45,163
I can help you if got a
ticket for littering a park

177
00:09:45,197 --> 00:09:46,533
but that's all the juice I got.

178
00:09:46,567 --> 00:09:48,383
Fine, then I'm a
consciencious objector.

179
00:09:48,415 --> 00:09:54,600
No, you signed for the reserves on your
own free drunk horny accord. You
are fucked!

180
00:09:59,695 --> 00:10:01,131
I am not going to Iraq

181
00:10:01,607 --> 00:10:04,413
to fight in some bullshit
war about oil money.

182
00:10:04,508 --> 00:10:05,793
Bullshit war?

183
00:10:05,927 --> 00:10:09,100
What about 9/11?
Didn't Iran hide the terrorists?

184
00:10:10,525 --> 00:10:12,503
We're fighting a
war in Iraq, Doug,

185
00:10:12,596 --> 00:10:16,180
and neither country had anything to do
with blowing up the World Trade Center.

186
00:10:16,218 --> 00:10:18,550
Well, they both have sand.

187
00:10:18,636 --> 00:10:21,500
Bush invaded a sovereign
nation in defiance of the UN.

188
00:10:22,566 --> 00:10:23,750
He's a war criminal

189
00:10:23,885 --> 00:10:26,270
and now I'm supposed to be
one of his disposable thugs

190
00:10:26,305 --> 00:10:29,680
with a fucking target on my head
in the middle of the desert

191
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:32,150
waiting to be blown
up by a carbomb

192
00:10:32,248 --> 00:10:35,012
rigged by a 12-year-old who
loved Friends and Metallica

193
00:10:35,097 --> 00:10:37,390
until one of your missiles
blew up his house ?

194
00:10:37,438 --> 00:10:38,702
I don't think so.

195
00:10:38,845 --> 00:10:41,363
They had weapons of
mass destruction!

196
00:10:41,886 --> 00:10:44,252
There were no weapons
of mass destruction!

197
00:10:44,438 --> 00:10:45,141
No?

198
00:10:46,686 --> 00:10:48,340
Well, whatever.

199
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:50,010
Look, I've got a
lot of shit to do.

200
00:10:50,045 --> 00:10:52,591
You name me one thing you have
to do that's more important

201
00:10:52,627 --> 00:10:54,941
than the corporate
takeover of our democracy!

202
00:10:55,265 --> 00:10:56,562
I gotta take a shit.

203
00:10:58,328 --> 00:10:59,701
You gotta help me, man.

204
00:10:59,835 --> 00:11:01,620
I will, I will.

205
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:05,141
I'm going to put one of those
yellow ribbon stickers on my car.

206
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:06,252
For you.

207
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:13,380
How could you be so
blindly pro-Bush?

208
00:11:14,025 --> 00:11:16,011
I like his wife, Laura.

209
00:11:16,627 --> 00:11:19,041
I used to buy weed
from her at SMU.

210
00:11:19,327 --> 00:11:20,413
Good shit!

211
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:21,780
Good shit.

212
00:11:27,297 --> 00:11:28,171
Silas?

213
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:42,911
Silas. Don't leave. Love. Mom.

214
00:11:46,837 --> 00:11:48,333
What happened at the hospital?

215
00:11:48,345 --> 00:11:49,251
Sent her home.

216
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:51,470
Can't even have a baby right.

217
00:11:52,216 --> 00:11:54,610
I wanna show you something
I've been working on.

218
00:11:55,886 --> 00:11:56,923
Superstrain.

219
00:11:57,065 --> 00:11:58,162
Grow anytime anywhere.

220
00:11:58,205 --> 00:11:59,662
Not in West Adams it won't.

221
00:11:59,747 --> 00:12:00,802
You're gonna be a dealer

222
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:02,780
or you're gonna be a
fucking gardener, Pedro?

223
00:12:02,816 --> 00:12:05,952
Heylia, in order for us to grow,
we have to grow.

224
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:09,230
We don't need no land, it's hydro.
All we need is warehouse space.

225
00:12:09,266 --> 00:12:10,353
Let it go, Conrad.

226
00:12:10,445 --> 00:12:13,213
Let it go? I won't be a middleman
for the rest of my life.

227
00:12:13,246 --> 00:12:16,770
Negro, please. You still got to
work your way up to the middle.

228
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,732
Yeah, well, all growers are starting
to send exclusively to the clubs.

229
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:21,672
Which means that we got
to get in on this now.

230
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:23,621
I did the research,
I'm telling you if we don't...

231
00:12:23,658 --> 00:12:26,223
Enough! Now this my business.

232
00:12:26,265 --> 00:12:27,833
You work for me.

233
00:12:28,117 --> 00:12:29,433
Oh shit!

234
00:12:30,376 --> 00:12:31,742
She in labor?

235
00:12:31,986 --> 00:12:33,190
Already been to the hospital.

236
00:12:33,228 --> 00:12:36,141
Ain't but 2cm dilated.
This one gonna be awhile.

237
00:12:36,225 --> 00:12:37,041
Fuck you!

238
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,063
That's right, baby!
Let it all out!

239
00:12:39,156 --> 00:12:40,621
Go to your happy place.

240
00:12:41,568 --> 00:12:43,941
So, Conrad, nice plant.

241
00:12:44,035 --> 00:12:46,281
You're working on a new
special blend for me?

242
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,111
What's the matter?

243
00:12:50,508 --> 00:12:51,912
Oh he not here.

244
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:53,471
Oh really?

245
00:12:53,758 --> 00:12:57,300
- He coming back soon?
- No.

246
00:12:57,905 --> 00:12:58,900
He's not.

247
00:12:58,977 --> 00:13:00,071
Not while you're here.

248
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:01,570
What's that supposed to mean?

249
00:13:01,606 --> 00:13:03,523
That means that from now on,

250
00:13:03,647 --> 00:13:06,082
if you got business to handle,
you handle it with me.

251
00:13:06,115 --> 00:13:08,460
You and Conrad ain't having
no more association.

252
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,332
Not while I'm alive and
kicking with my pointy shoes.

253
00:13:11,436 --> 00:13:13,543
I don't understand.
What did I do?

254
00:13:13,616 --> 00:13:15,310
You brought out
the stupid in him.

255
00:13:15,325 --> 00:13:19,362
No, I'm sure you didn't tell him
to go down that little school

256
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:22,932
and beat the tar out of little
Mr. Security Guard but...

257
00:13:23,025 --> 00:13:25,121
you blinked them big brown eyes

258
00:13:25,217 --> 00:13:26,533
and there he go.

259
00:13:26,618 --> 00:13:27,943
And I can't have that.

260
00:13:28,036 --> 00:13:29,070
You did that?

261
00:13:29,168 --> 00:13:30,392
Who you think done it?

262
00:13:30,508 --> 00:13:31,992
The Fuck-You-Up fairy?

263
00:13:32,096 --> 00:13:34,710
I didn't... I had no idea.

264
00:13:34,858 --> 00:13:37,421
- I never would have.
- And you never will.

265
00:13:37,888 --> 00:13:40,432
So if you want to keep on
doing business over here,

266
00:13:40,688 --> 00:13:43,110
you're  gonna do it
with me and Vanita.

267
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,851
You can't tell me
who to talk to.

268
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:48,553
Conrad, say something.

269
00:13:57,816 --> 00:13:59,852
- He's my friend.
- What's it gonna be?

270
00:14:01,205 --> 00:14:02,673
You're gonna play

271
00:14:03,608 --> 00:14:06,520
or you're gonna get the fuck out
of my kitchen and never come back.

272
00:14:06,556 --> 00:14:08,751
That's... not a fair choice.

273
00:14:09,257 --> 00:14:11,723
Fair is what you
pay to ride the bus.

274
00:14:11,776 --> 00:14:14,103
See, that's the
only fair I know.

275
00:14:18,265 --> 00:14:19,253
Forget it.

276
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,840
I'm out of here.

277
00:14:22,288 --> 00:14:23,661
Are you sure about that?

278
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:25,970
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

279
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,710
You hear that shit, Vanita?
She said maybe.

280
00:14:28,946 --> 00:14:30,570
I think my water just broke!

281
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:33,363
On my good chair?
What the fuck!

282
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,681
God! You didn't think
to put a towel down?

283
00:14:35,735 --> 00:14:36,960
Mommy!

284
00:14:37,106 --> 00:14:39,260
All right, baby, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

285
00:14:40,365 --> 00:14:41,832
Thank you.

286
00:14:43,095 --> 00:14:44,760
So how do you know Nancy?

287
00:14:48,598 --> 00:14:51,200
Our sons do karate together.

288
00:14:51,318 --> 00:14:53,340
Have you known each other long?

289
00:14:54,188 --> 00:14:55,891
No, we met a few weeks ago.

290
00:14:56,175 --> 00:14:57,372
Hey, can I get a muffin?

291
00:14:57,398 --> 00:14:59,193
What are your
intentions with Nancy?

292
00:14:59,828 --> 00:15:01,573
I intent to have
a coffee with her.

293
00:15:02,085 --> 00:15:03,540
And  a muffin.

294
00:15:04,158 --> 00:15:06,013
She's a remarkable woman.

295
00:15:06,095 --> 00:15:08,661
Strong yet feminine.

296
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:12,753
Brave and bold with
beautiful skin.

297
00:15:13,226 --> 00:15:16,270
Yes... lovely.

298
00:15:16,486 --> 00:15:18,952
Lovely skin.

299
00:15:19,387 --> 00:15:21,090
How's the Bananana?

300
00:15:21,348 --> 00:15:22,381
Do you love her?

301
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:25,460
Peter, I'm so sorry. I'm late.

302
00:15:25,556 --> 00:15:27,181
So you do know this guy?

303
00:15:27,407 --> 00:15:30,632
Yes, I do, Sanjay. Thank you.

304
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,182
He says he wants a muffin.

305
00:15:33,727 --> 00:15:35,880
Get him a muffin.

306
00:15:35,997 --> 00:15:37,351
Really? Are you sure that's
what you want me to do?

307
00:15:37,386 --> 00:15:39,462
Yes. Yes, I do.

308
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,141
Would you leave us
alone for a second?

309
00:15:41,178 --> 00:15:42,681
Toast it, please.

310
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:46,442
Fine but I'll be close
by if you need me.

311
00:15:46,518 --> 00:15:47,410
Okay.

312
00:15:50,308 --> 00:15:51,493
He's uh...

313
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:55,272
very protective of you.

314
00:15:55,418 --> 00:15:57,871
- Puppy love.
- Smart puppy.

315
00:15:58,665 --> 00:16:00,141
Listen, Peter.

316
00:16:00,888 --> 00:16:03,023
I hate sentences that
start with "listen".

317
00:16:03,115 --> 00:16:05,120
They never finish with "you
just won a million dollars"

318
00:16:05,156 --> 00:16:07,783
or "I need to rip your clothes
off within the next 5 minutes".

319
00:16:07,815 --> 00:16:10,363
I actually have to leave
in the next 5 minutes.

320
00:16:10,477 --> 00:16:13,041
I have some things I have to deal with.
It's Silas.

321
00:16:13,145 --> 00:16:13,652
See.

322
00:16:13,745 --> 00:16:15,372
Maybe our timing is just...

323
00:16:15,515 --> 00:16:16,541
bad.

324
00:16:16,645 --> 00:16:19,773
Maybe just having a busy day,
so you can't

325
00:16:19,866 --> 00:16:22,410
have coffee with me right now.
It's okay.

326
00:16:23,185 --> 00:16:25,613
I'm gonna be alone
this weekend.

327
00:16:25,728 --> 00:16:27,363
Tim will stay with his mother.

328
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:31,703
My life is not gonna get any less
complicated anytime soon.

329
00:16:35,806 --> 00:16:37,932
I'm trying here, Nancy.
I'm really trying.

330
00:16:38,036 --> 00:16:41,141
I know you are and I really
appreciate it. I just...

331
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:46,151
Maybe another time
in my life...

332
00:16:46,267 --> 00:16:48,522
421, McKuan Lane.

333
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:52,191
I'm not promising anything.

334
00:16:52,305 --> 00:16:53,661
I'm  not asking you to.

335
00:16:59,156 --> 00:17:00,901
Muffin.

336
00:17:01,795 --> 00:17:02,633
To go.

337
00:17:02,885 --> 00:17:03,640
Great.

338
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:05,720
Okay...

339
00:17:06,177 --> 00:17:08,312
you cannot become a lesbian

340
00:17:08,406 --> 00:17:10,730
just because you don't
wanna lose weight.

341
00:17:12,238 --> 00:17:14,092
The only girl that
you should be seeing

342
00:17:14,128 --> 00:17:15,832
is Jenny Craig.

343
00:17:15,975 --> 00:17:16,531
What?

344
00:17:16,645 --> 00:17:19,590
I know. I know.
You see people like Rosie O'Donnell

345
00:17:19,676 --> 00:17:21,953
and you think "hey!
she can find love!"

346
00:17:22,048 --> 00:17:25,861
but that is not where
lesbianism is going, Isabel.

347
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:28,360
Look at The L Word.

348
00:17:28,967 --> 00:17:30,073
I love Peggy.

349
00:17:30,386 --> 00:17:31,462
And she loves me.

350
00:17:31,565 --> 00:17:33,932
She's a little asian girl.
They look like boys already.

351
00:17:33,968 --> 00:17:35,461
You might as well go
for the real deal.

352
00:17:35,496 --> 00:17:36,520
Hey! I have boobs!

353
00:17:36,635 --> 00:17:38,082
Those are not boobs.

354
00:17:38,315 --> 00:17:43,082
Call your grandparents and tell
them to come and pick you up, please.

355
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,323
- I knew it wouldn't last.
- What?

356
00:17:47,398 --> 00:17:48,693
The new and improved you.

357
00:17:49,097 --> 00:17:50,791
You're feeling better,
aren't you?

358
00:17:51,686 --> 00:17:52,910
You're not gonna die.

359
00:17:53,068 --> 00:17:53,912
No.

360
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:57,092
I'm going to live for a long,
long time.

361
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:01,240
Doctors say I'm doing really,
really well.

362
00:18:01,315 --> 00:18:04,001
You know, maybe you should
doublecheck just to be sure.

363
00:18:04,035 --> 00:18:06,801
I mean, there's still some
chance you'll die, right?

364
00:18:06,977 --> 00:18:08,261
Why would you say that?

365
00:18:08,385 --> 00:18:10,331
'Cause when you think
you're gonna die,

366
00:18:10,555 --> 00:18:12,972
you're a much better person.

367
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:16,911
She says I can't play
with her daughter anymore

368
00:18:16,985 --> 00:18:18,420
because she hates immigrants

369
00:18:18,466 --> 00:18:20,910
and thinks we should get
out of her neighborhood.

370
00:18:22,608 --> 00:18:24,131
They're on their way.

371
00:18:27,116 --> 00:18:27,961
Here.

372
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:29,761
Cut off my toe.

373
00:18:30,256 --> 00:18:30,951
What?

374
00:18:38,805 --> 00:18:40,650
- Is this for real?
- Yes, just do it!

375
00:18:44,675 --> 00:18:46,540
Are you out of you mind?
That's my toe!

376
00:18:46,575 --> 00:18:47,891
You asked me.

377
00:18:50,098 --> 00:18:53,202
Okay, I'm not thinking clearly.
It's obvious what I have to do,

378
00:18:53,235 --> 00:18:54,800
I have to move to Vermont

379
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,562
and get a boyfriend
and marry him.

380
00:19:03,886 --> 00:19:05,221
Look who's awake.

381
00:19:11,037 --> 00:19:12,220
How are you feeling?

382
00:19:12,365 --> 00:19:13,611
Like crap.

383
00:19:13,847 --> 00:19:15,801
Remember it fondly 'cause it's

384
00:19:15,966 --> 00:19:18,531
all downhill from here.

385
00:19:18,856 --> 00:19:21,800
- We were just screwing around.
- You took ecstasy.

386
00:19:22,048 --> 00:19:25,132
That shit is like taking ice
scream scoops out of your brain.

387
00:19:25,255 --> 00:19:26,131
Original.

388
00:19:27,197 --> 00:19:29,412
I may have been fucked up but

389
00:19:29,856 --> 00:19:31,702
I heard officer Friendly too.

390
00:19:32,135 --> 00:19:34,793
You think you're cute?
I swear to God, Silas,

391
00:19:34,887 --> 00:19:37,222
if I have to lock you in your room
until you get some sense, I will.

392
00:19:37,257 --> 00:19:38,991
You don't fuck
around with drugs.

393
00:19:39,517 --> 00:19:41,510
This... from you?

394
00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:43,592
You're the biggest
hypocrit on Earth.

395
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:49,411
I don't take drugs.
When have you ever seen me take drugs?

396
00:19:49,607 --> 00:19:51,843
Maybe not take them but...

397
00:19:55,085 --> 00:19:57,163
sure do sell 'em.

398
00:20:01,365 --> 00:20:03,221
I live here too, mom.

399
00:20:04,157 --> 00:20:07,810
Or have you not noticed because
you've been so busy with your business?

400
00:20:08,518 --> 00:20:10,130
I'm not an idiot.

401
00:20:12,848 --> 00:20:13,780
Listen...

402
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:19,910
I'm not a drug addict.

403
00:20:20,358 --> 00:20:23,661
Yeah, I like to do a little weed
and trying E for the first time.

404
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:26,093
Rolling was fun.
Totally, totally fun.

405
00:20:26,188 --> 00:20:28,482
I'm not running out of
the door to score more.

406
00:20:28,606 --> 00:20:33,622
Look, I don't blame you for you
doing what you need to do. I guess.

407
00:20:35,156 --> 00:20:36,641
Let's just stay out
of each other's way.

408
00:20:36,678 --> 00:20:39,092
You're 16. I'm your mother. No.

409
00:20:39,725 --> 00:20:40,450
No?

410
00:20:40,608 --> 00:20:43,031
I'm not giving you
carte blanche at 16

411
00:20:43,115 --> 00:20:46,232
to do whatever the hell
you want because I made a

412
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:48,323
- questionable decision.
- What choice do you have?

413
00:20:48,358 --> 00:20:50,303
I have the choice to kick
you out of this house.

414
00:20:50,338 --> 00:20:52,350
Oh you wanna explain
that to Shane?

415
00:20:52,345 --> 00:20:53,673
No, of course not.

416
00:20:53,776 --> 00:20:56,092
He's been through enough.
We all have.

417
00:20:56,635 --> 00:20:58,750
Let's just be peaceful, okay?

418
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,290
Just do our thing.

419
00:21:02,047 --> 00:21:03,270
I'm going to Megan's.

420
00:21:36,516 --> 00:21:37,910
What the hell are you doing?

421
00:21:38,026 --> 00:21:39,980
Practicing to be dead in
case I gotta go to Iraq.

422
00:21:40,018 --> 00:21:42,220
There's very little
water in Iraq.

423
00:21:42,297 --> 00:21:43,990
Then I'll float in
a pool of blood

424
00:21:44,365 --> 00:21:46,683
or oil.
Whatever they got, I'm ready to float.

425
00:21:46,785 --> 00:21:47,890
I'm sinking.

426
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:49,212
What are you talking about?

427
00:21:49,247 --> 00:21:50,570
Silas just informed me

428
00:21:50,665 --> 00:21:53,191
that I have no parental rights
because I'm a drug dealer.

429
00:21:53,226 --> 00:21:54,891
How the fuck did he find out?

430
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:59,820
How the fuck do you think he wouldn't,
Weedy Mac Weedweed?

431
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:03,672
I don't have to apologize
for being a weed dealer.

432
00:22:04,826 --> 00:22:06,262
It's a choice I made.

433
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:10,383
I happen to be very good at it.

434
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,663
Providing for my family.

435
00:22:13,226 --> 00:22:15,081
I'm not sorry.

436
00:22:15,826 --> 00:22:19,442
Well, you don't have to be sorry.
He's not mad at you for selling drugs.

437
00:22:19,536 --> 00:22:21,600
He's mad at you
for lying to him.

438
00:22:21,695 --> 00:22:24,273
So he hit his brother
and he took ecstasy?

439
00:22:24,368 --> 00:22:26,850
Ecstasy is a whole lot of fun.

440
00:22:26,975 --> 00:22:30,073
I don't wanna choose between
my business and my family.

441
00:22:30,455 --> 00:22:32,153
You don't have to.

442
00:22:33,745 --> 00:22:36,051
You gotta be honest
with your family

443
00:22:36,136 --> 00:22:37,461
about your business.

444
00:22:37,586 --> 00:22:38,533
Tell Shane?

445
00:22:39,048 --> 00:22:42,631
Unless you want a
repeat performance.

446
00:22:48,505 --> 00:22:49,091
Yo!

447
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:54,391
So you're talking to me now?

448
00:23:01,977 --> 00:23:03,080
What's that?

449
00:23:03,328 --> 00:23:05,770
Going away present?
I don't want it.

450
00:23:05,856 --> 00:23:06,972
Oh I think you do.

451
00:23:07,066 --> 00:23:08,882
Let me tell you a little bit
about my baby right there.

452
00:23:08,915 --> 00:23:11,721
60 days to harvest,
10 days to cure, hydro.

453
00:23:11,907 --> 00:23:14,531
From seeds outdoor,
you're looking at 85 to a 105

454
00:23:14,616 --> 00:23:16,961
plus cure days and
germination harvest.

455
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:20,293
We can even shorten that cycle with
forced flower enlighten cycles,

456
00:23:20,327 --> 00:23:21,701
tying down and splitting.

457
00:23:21,746 --> 00:23:23,360
I have no idea

458
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:24,662
what you're talking about.

459
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:28,302
I'm saying front me some
money for place and equipment.

460
00:23:28,638 --> 00:23:31,481
And we'll be selling our
own shit inside of 3 months.

461
00:23:31,545 --> 00:23:33,363
And what am I supposed
to do in the meantime?

462
00:23:33,395 --> 00:23:35,132
Better go make
nice with Heylia.

463
00:23:35,376 --> 00:23:37,433
Pretend that
nothing is going on.

464
00:23:37,467 --> 00:23:38,641
No offense...

465
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,971
get rid of this fucking bakery.

466
00:23:41,067 --> 00:23:44,493
Take the cash and let
us start a business.

467
00:23:46,896 --> 00:23:49,832
You do that to Heylia,
she'll never speak to you again.

468
00:23:50,998 --> 00:23:52,412
Well, fuck Heylia.

469
00:23:52,746 --> 00:23:54,662
I heard everything
she had to say.

470
00:23:54,928 --> 00:23:56,492
What you wanna do?

471
00:24:04,078 --> 00:24:05,793
I wanna hear more.

472
00:24:13,168 --> 00:24:14,161
Peggy?

473
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:16,423
Peggy?

474
00:24:16,648 --> 00:24:19,211
Isabel, this is Grissom.

475
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,441
Can you hold on
just one second?

476
00:24:23,738 --> 00:24:24,683
What are you doing?

477
00:24:24,727 --> 00:24:27,370
I'm doing what we practiced
and I think it's working.

478
00:24:27,616 --> 00:24:28,852
He really likes me.

479
00:24:30,117 --> 00:24:32,350
- You look really hot!
- I do?

480
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:34,342
Yeah, you're really sweaty.

481
00:24:38,828 --> 00:24:42,061
Shalom, Nancy.
Are you having a party without me?

482
00:24:44,096 --> 00:24:45,851
I don't even wanna know.

483
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:47,773
Just... go.

484
00:24:47,905 --> 00:24:49,521
But I am not going anywhere.

485
00:24:49,665 --> 00:24:52,403
In the Mishna and
the US military code,

486
00:24:52,478 --> 00:24:56,780
it is written fulltime students working
toward becoming ordained ministers

487
00:24:56,858 --> 00:24:59,720
in a recognized religion are
differed from military service.

488
00:24:59,757 --> 00:25:01,682
In other words,
once you go rabbi,

489
00:25:01,758 --> 00:25:03,342
you never go bye-bye.

490
00:25:03,485 --> 00:25:05,170
Mazel tov, Andy!

491
00:25:07,765 --> 00:25:11,763
So uh... what's going on?
You can confide in me now.

492
00:25:11,858 --> 00:25:14,420
I'm switching around
some things. Business.

493
00:25:14,518 --> 00:25:16,132
You're gonna let me play?

494
00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:30,060
Under strict supervision.

495
00:25:35,816 --> 00:25:36,510
Hey!

496
00:25:41,126 --> 00:25:42,130
Okay...

497
00:25:43,656 --> 00:25:45,350
Distribution...

498
00:25:45,815 --> 00:25:47,331
meet finance...

499
00:25:48,887 --> 00:25:49,771
sales...

500
00:25:51,155 --> 00:25:52,163
legal...

501
00:25:54,165 --> 00:25:56,221
Yentl.

502
00:26:00,478 --> 00:26:02,972
So we're gonna open the
vine or just watch it age?

503
00:26:03,115 --> 00:26:05,093
- Corkscrew?
- No, just a minute.

504
00:26:06,336 --> 00:26:07,820
So who's gonna be our muscle?

505
00:26:08,947 --> 00:26:09,933
I would do it but

506
00:26:10,015 --> 00:26:11,021
I've got bursitis.

507
00:26:11,318 --> 00:26:13,261
Don't look at me,
I went to law school.

508
00:26:17,186 --> 00:26:19,053
Fine, I'll be the muscle.

509
00:26:20,155 --> 00:26:21,372
Back off, man!

510
00:26:21,457 --> 00:26:22,811
I'm pitching tomorrow.

511
00:26:22,908 --> 00:26:24,141
You go, girl!

512
00:26:27,088 --> 00:26:28,262
Hi, sweety.

513
00:26:28,366 --> 00:26:29,543
What's going on?

514
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:30,473
What?

515
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:31,733
Nothing.

516
00:26:31,795 --> 00:26:33,413
I heard you and Silas fighting.

517
00:26:33,838 --> 00:26:37,192
We were angry. We'll be okay.

518
00:26:41,426 --> 00:26:43,922
- Are you sure?
- Of course, honey.

519
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:45,883
What's going on outside?

520
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,443
I was lonely.

521
00:26:50,778 --> 00:26:53,320
So I invited some friends over.

522
00:26:56,917 --> 00:26:58,022
Shane...

523
00:26:58,357 --> 00:26:59,231
look at me.

524
00:26:59,348 --> 00:27:00,762
Everything is gonna be okay.

525
00:27:01,566 --> 00:27:02,920
All right?

526
00:27:04,386 --> 00:27:05,472
I love you.

527
00:27:06,457 --> 00:27:07,063
Yeah.

528
00:27:07,947 --> 00:27:08,751
Me too.
