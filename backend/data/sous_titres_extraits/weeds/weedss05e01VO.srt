00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:06,255
Previously on <i>Weeds</i>...

2
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,966
This is your new job.
It's a maternity store.

3
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:10,885
This is the back room.

4
00:00:22,597 --> 00:00:24,147
You must be punished.

5
00:00:26,486 --> 00:00:27,568
He's the mayor?

6
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:33,365
- Are you in love with me?
- Yes.

7
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,744
You take too many drugs.

8
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:38,481
Mostly Xanax and coke.

9
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:40,664
Cocaine? Coca?

10
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,881
At some point recently,
everything became right or wrong.

11
00:00:49,155 --> 00:00:50,174
What did you do?

12
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,817
- What the fuck?
- Exactly. What the fuck?

13
00:00:53,942 --> 00:00:55,387
It's supposed to be a pot tunnel.

14
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,182
There's no magical
"weed only" sign at the entrance.

15
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,267
Captain Till?
There's a tunnel.

16
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:03,896
You make a bust, you get Guillermo,
and it never comes back to me.

17
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,898
- I'm Simone.
- I'm Harmony. Do you party?

18
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:08,309
Head cheese sandwich.

19
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:10,754
I'm not giving weed
to my little brother!

20
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,658
- You're in love with Nancy.
- I'm not in love with Nancy.

21
00:01:15,974 --> 00:01:18,285
- You so are.
- I gotta go. Shit's blowing up.

22
00:01:18,586 --> 00:01:20,746
I used to have shit blowing up
all the time. Now nothing.

23
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:23,999
Legendary!

24
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,352
I am the only one here

25
00:01:26,477 --> 00:01:28,921
that has any chance to make amends.

26
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,798
I don't know where Quinn is.

27
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,925
She's living in Oaxaca
with a guy named Rodolfo.

28
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,998
I'm just so glad
that you came here to see me

29
00:01:35,123 --> 00:01:37,054
so that I could tie you up
and lock you in a room

30
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,224
until I sell your ass back
into suburban slavery...

31
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:41,792
you fucking bitch.

32
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,854
- Shall I call your father now?
- Tell Daddy Dean I want $200,000.

33
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:49,650
Who's Guillermo's boss?
Who owns the fucking tunnel?

34
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:50,859
I don't know.

35
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,529
- I'd like to see you, tonight.
- Has to be tonight?

36
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,823
- I will send a car.
- I can drive myself.

37
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,253
<i>Terrifically gift baskets.</i>

38
00:01:57,378 --> 00:02:01,164
I need to get a birthday gift
for my 18-year-old. Can you help me?

39
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:02,734
I'm thinking of buying some land.

40
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:05,415
- A little farm where I can grow pot.
- You want a partner?

41
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,460
<i>- What would you like the card to say?</i>
- "Silas, you are loved."

42
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,003
And add the butter cookies.

43
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,172
I thought you loved me.

44
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,423
I do love you.

45
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:16,343
- I think I can make you happy.
- It's too late.

46
00:02:23,896 --> 00:02:25,477
It feels like a boy.

47
00:02:34,242 --> 00:02:36,166
Weeds 501
Wonderful Wonderful

48
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,485
By the Fumistes team.

49
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:55,003
It feels like a boy.

50
00:03:18,168 --> 00:03:20,073
Anyone else
know about the situation?

51
00:03:26,502 --> 00:03:29,052
Send some flowers to the families
and...

52
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,458
buy a new rug.

53
00:03:32,794 --> 00:03:34,087
You should go home now.

54
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:37,465
- I should.
- Cesar will take you home.

55
00:03:37,847 --> 00:03:40,051
No, that's okay. I have my car.
I can drive myself.

56
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:42,804
Cesar will drive you home
in you car, then.

57
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:45,429
No. He must have a lot on his mind.

58
00:03:46,262 --> 00:03:48,062
The sudden death of two...

59
00:03:48,593 --> 00:03:50,604
work friends.
He should take some time to process.

60
00:03:51,124 --> 00:03:52,439
I don't need to process.

61
00:03:56,004 --> 00:03:58,239
If you're gonna kill me,
please do it fast,

62
00:03:58,364 --> 00:03:59,465
like with these guys,

63
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,219
not the whole,
"Let's go for a drive,

64
00:04:01,344 --> 00:04:03,575
and then at some point,
we pull over and I'll shoot you".

65
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,162
Go home.

66
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:09,706
Alone?

67
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,086
I will be in touch.

68
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:22,010
- There is another door.
- Oh, right, the other door. Okay.

69
00:04:23,601 --> 00:04:25,638
- I'll talk to you soon.
- Oh, yes.

70
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:28,135
Okay. Bye, then.

71
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,107
This is a beautiful card.

72
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:37,936
Here, take it.

73
00:04:39,392 --> 00:04:42,192
I think I'm gonna pass.
Beauty is subjective.

74
00:04:43,007 --> 00:04:43,740
However,

75
00:04:44,514 --> 00:04:45,700
this is gorgeous.

76
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,038
Is this Dean Hodes?

77
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:52,411
Mr. Dean Hodes?

78
00:04:53,219 --> 00:04:54,685
- Damn it!
- What?

79
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:55,877
Fucking bugs.

80
00:04:56,002 --> 00:04:58,022
Please, be quiet
when I'm on the phone!

81
00:05:01,453 --> 00:05:02,553
<i>Who is this?</i>

82
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,052
I have your wife.

83
00:05:04,665 --> 00:05:05,929
- Excuse me?
<i>- Celia.</i>

84
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,014
I have your wife, Celia.

85
00:05:08,615 --> 00:05:10,016
Now, you listen to me.

86
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,309
You send me money...

87
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:13,770
Yeah, she's no longer my wife.
We're divorced.

88
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,772
Then I will kill her.

89
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,523
You hear me?
If you do not pay,

90
00:05:17,763 --> 00:05:18,524
she dies.

91
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:19,943
Dad, I'm throwing a six.

92
00:05:20,263 --> 00:05:23,780
Yeah, listen. I'm broke and she's my ex.
So you do what you got to do, okay?

93
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,545
Are you not listening to me?

94
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:29,452
I will kill her! I slit her neck!
I smash her head!

95
00:05:29,795 --> 00:05:32,497
All right. Thanks for calling.
Knock yourself out. Bye-bye.

96
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,386
Well that...

97
00:05:38,641 --> 00:05:40,007
is the one, Gin!

98
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:41,798
He hung up.

99
00:05:42,883 --> 00:05:45,760
He probably couldn't understand you
with your fucking lame accent.

100
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,513
He understood me.
He's broke.

101
00:05:48,895 --> 00:05:51,349
- Who was on the phone?
- Someone's kidnapped your mother.

102
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,391
Seriously?

103
00:05:53,335 --> 00:05:55,520
- Who knows. Another game?
- Sure.

104
00:05:56,563 --> 00:05:59,402
We are fighting for the souls
of workers everywhere.

105
00:06:02,859 --> 00:06:04,403
Get me my money!

106
00:06:09,105 --> 00:06:10,200
Jesus!

107
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,710
What the hell is going on here?

108
00:06:49,098 --> 00:06:51,659
So, we pick up some Mexican farmland

109
00:06:51,827 --> 00:06:53,999
on the cheap and make a go of it.

110
00:06:54,124 --> 00:06:55,786
This cookie is amazing.

111
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:58,040
It's so simple and yet so delicious.

112
00:06:58,417 --> 00:06:59,773
That's a terrible plan.

113
00:06:59,898 --> 00:07:02,797
The soil in Mexico is full of paraquat,
a Mexican sewer poop.

114
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,255
No one's gonna buy that.

115
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,306
And the hassle
of getting it across the border.

116
00:07:06,431 --> 00:07:07,675
Do you even speak Spanish?

117
00:07:08,068 --> 00:07:10,094
What are the marks on your neck?

118
00:07:11,075 --> 00:07:13,105
- Jerked off with a noose.
- Nice.

119
00:07:14,005 --> 00:07:16,155
Hey, stoners, mom ever come back?

120
00:07:16,696 --> 00:07:17,696
Nice hair.

121
00:07:17,821 --> 00:07:20,688
Yeah, Simone and Harmony did it.
And check it out.

122
00:07:21,522 --> 00:07:22,356
Wrong ear.

123
00:07:22,711 --> 00:07:23,983
Fuck! Seriously?

124
00:07:24,854 --> 00:07:26,832
- I'm kidding.
- Asshole.

125
00:07:28,303 --> 00:07:30,197
You guys ought to grow
in a national park,

126
00:07:30,365 --> 00:07:32,358
All the cool kids are doing it now,
and it's free.

127
00:07:32,483 --> 00:07:33,733
Like the eagle,

128
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,780
gift with purchase,

129
00:07:36,178 --> 00:07:37,496
the Nelson Mandela.

130
00:07:37,785 --> 00:07:39,373
Is there a national park
around here?

131
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,051
There's Cleveland national forest.

132
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:43,544
We're not in Ohio, little man.
Are you on drugs?

133
00:07:43,712 --> 00:07:45,004
It's in San Diego county.

134
00:07:45,172 --> 00:07:47,798
We should grow
in Cincinnati national forest, Silas.

135
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:49,216
Cleveland.

136
00:07:49,715 --> 00:07:53,178
Cleveland, Pittsburgh. You're obsessed
with the rust belt. What is that?

137
00:07:53,346 --> 00:07:55,905
If mom doesn't come home by the end
of the week, I call her bedroom.

138
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,309
Fuck that. I'm older.
I get the room.

139
00:07:58,556 --> 00:07:59,602
You vultures.

140
00:08:00,182 --> 00:08:03,070
If Nancy doesn't come back,
we shroud the room in clear plastic

141
00:08:03,195 --> 00:08:04,918
and nothing's touched, you hear me?

142
00:08:05,043 --> 00:08:07,060
You touch nothing in there,

143
00:08:07,383 --> 00:08:08,388
animals.

144
00:08:09,025 --> 00:08:11,196
- Rock, paper, scissors?
- Best two out of three. Go.

145
00:08:11,537 --> 00:08:12,625
1, 2, 3.

146
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,700
Sorry to disappoint you,
but I'm back.

147
00:08:16,175 --> 00:08:18,602
- You're back... She's back.
- Yeah.

148
00:08:19,571 --> 00:08:20,873
What's wrong with your neck?

149
00:08:39,245 --> 00:08:41,468
- Hello?
- <i>I have your friend.</i>

150
00:08:42,547 --> 00:08:44,306
What? Who is this?
What friend?

151
00:08:44,431 --> 00:08:45,522
<i>Your friend, Celia.</i>

152
00:08:46,344 --> 00:08:49,593
<i>I have her.
And you pay me money, or she dies.</i>

153
00:08:49,718 --> 00:08:50,726
Celia?

154
00:08:51,014 --> 00:08:52,114
<i>Celia Hodes!</i>

155
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,554
<i>I have kidnapped her,
and today I chop off her ear.</i>

156
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:57,048
How Van Gogh.

157
00:08:57,173 --> 00:08:58,035
<i>What?</i>

158
00:08:58,648 --> 00:09:01,484
<i>You send me $40,000, or I'll do it!</i>

159
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,360
It's too early for this.
We're really not friends.

160
00:09:05,485 --> 00:09:06,820
<i>Okay, thirty...</i>

161
00:09:10,225 --> 00:09:11,905
Hey, you up? You awake?

162
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:15,452
- Heard your cellphone ring, so...
- Andy, I need to sleep.

163
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:17,095
I got a plan.

164
00:09:17,263 --> 00:09:18,347
That's nice.

165
00:09:19,162 --> 00:09:20,412
We should flee.

166
00:09:22,616 --> 00:09:23,935
That's my plan, fleeing.

167
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,700
We can't flee.

168
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:26,688
Why not?

169
00:09:27,008 --> 00:09:29,900
It's the Mexican mafia.
There's nowhere to go.

170
00:09:30,068 --> 00:09:32,617
What are you gonna do?
Sit around, wait for them to kill us?

171
00:09:32,742 --> 00:09:34,404
You? You and us?

172
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,532
It's only a matter of time, Nance.

173
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,591
You finked, and they know it,
don't they?

174
00:09:39,716 --> 00:09:42,449
And now they're just playing with you.
You're a cat toy,

175
00:09:42,574 --> 00:09:44,722
and they're cats.
Mexican cats

176
00:09:44,947 --> 00:09:45,749
<i>Gatos.</i>

177
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,669
- Please, let me sleep.
- No.

178
00:09:49,837 --> 00:09:53,187
Time to get up, 'cause I've got
a whole plan worked out.

179
00:09:55,852 --> 00:09:57,094
We're going to Denmark.

180
00:09:59,061 --> 00:10:01,947
The Mexican mafia's not gonna
find us in Copenhagen.

181
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,520
Right?
It's supposed to be wonderful there.

182
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,202
Wonderful, wonderful.

183
00:10:08,694 --> 00:10:09,856
And I love you.

184
00:10:16,739 --> 00:10:17,889
I'm pregnant.

185
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,520
I need to sleep.

186
00:10:27,266 --> 00:10:28,268
That's...

187
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:34,089
Wait. What?

188
00:10:34,257 --> 00:10:35,804
No, no, get some sleep.

189
00:10:36,341 --> 00:10:37,735
I'll talk to you later.

190
00:10:48,478 --> 00:10:49,480
What?

191
00:10:50,955 --> 00:10:52,092
Hi, Cesar.

192
00:10:52,326 --> 00:10:55,355
<i>I'm giving you an address.
You will be there at 2:00 p.m.</i>

193
00:11:06,372 --> 00:11:08,612
Did you get to
the anal rape scene yet?

194
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:11,543
- Thanks for ruining it for me.
- Don't worry, there's two.

195
00:11:12,181 --> 00:11:14,065
I don't think I'm gonna finish this.

196
00:11:19,803 --> 00:11:21,736
Hello, Shane.
Doing your reading?

197
00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:23,111
Mr. Sandusky...

198
00:11:23,844 --> 00:11:26,683
Did you actually read "The Kite Runner",
before you assigned it?

199
00:11:27,358 --> 00:11:29,185
I did.
I thought you guys could handle it.

200
00:11:29,511 --> 00:11:31,187
Can you handle it, Shane?

201
00:11:31,355 --> 00:11:33,523
It seems you can handle a lot.
You're such a multitasker.

202
00:11:34,096 --> 00:11:35,906
I don't know
what you're talking about.

203
00:11:36,031 --> 00:11:38,319
- Sure, you do.
- No, I don't.

204
00:11:40,018 --> 00:11:43,480
I have 23 papers to grade tonight.
They're all on Anne Frank.

205
00:11:43,715 --> 00:11:45,432
Do you know how depressing that is?

206
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,036
You pick really sad books.

207
00:11:47,318 --> 00:11:49,229
Which is why I need some pot.

208
00:11:49,354 --> 00:11:51,119
Plus, you people
can't write for shit.

209
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,543
- That's even sadder.
- Shouldn't that be "more sad"?

210
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:56,044
Tell me, smart ass,

211
00:11:56,481 --> 00:11:58,410
if I were to confiscate
your bag right now

212
00:11:58,535 --> 00:12:00,341
and go through it
with principal Rowan,

213
00:12:01,132 --> 00:12:02,302
what would we find?

214
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:06,180
A cure for depression?

215
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,437
He always wore
wife beaters or tank tops.

216
00:12:12,762 --> 00:12:13,924
He had a beard.

217
00:12:14,557 --> 00:12:16,024
I like guys with beards.

218
00:12:16,627 --> 00:12:18,376
You saw no one else,

219
00:12:18,901 --> 00:12:20,201
the entire time?

220
00:12:20,844 --> 00:12:21,863
No big boss?

221
00:12:22,804 --> 00:12:25,533
No, just the cute one
with the beard.

222
00:12:28,783 --> 00:12:31,839
<i>Hey, cap, there's a guy on line one,
calling from Mexico.</i>

223
00:12:31,964 --> 00:12:35,215
- <i>He's demanding to talk to you.</i>
- Trace it. Could be related.

224
00:12:43,282 --> 00:12:44,708
Let me get this straight.

225
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,096
You want a ransom for Celia Hodes?

226
00:12:49,514 --> 00:12:50,864
Go fuck yourself!

227
00:12:54,392 --> 00:12:56,492
Cancel the trace, it's bullshit.

228
00:12:57,232 --> 00:12:58,664
See? Right here?

229
00:12:59,026 --> 00:13:02,060
That's a six-hour hike,
and there are no roads up there.

230
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:04,256
I think we should check it out.

231
00:13:06,989 --> 00:13:08,601
Yeah. It's sure.

232
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,924
It's gonna be a lot to carry.

233
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:13,654
We're gonna need to pack out
all the plants, advanced nutrients.

234
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:15,979
We need tubing for a water system.

235
00:13:19,906 --> 00:13:20,906
Who?

236
00:13:23,591 --> 00:13:25,828
That cunt can lick my balls.

237
00:13:26,293 --> 00:13:27,501
Tell her I said hi.

238
00:13:28,615 --> 00:13:30,181
Tubing, plants, what else?

239
00:13:30,651 --> 00:13:33,012
I don't remember
inviting you into this, Doug.

240
00:13:33,137 --> 00:13:34,928
Come on, I'm an extra pack mule.

241
00:13:35,053 --> 00:13:37,169
And I'm bored, and I'm good at this.

242
00:13:37,712 --> 00:13:39,880
I used to take my family
camping every year.

243
00:13:40,005 --> 00:13:42,693
And Andy's gone catatonic,
at least you could chat with me.

244
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,371
Andy, buddy, doing okay?

245
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,199
Fine, I'm doing fine.

246
00:13:52,346 --> 00:13:53,684
Yeah, I know Celia.

247
00:13:57,417 --> 00:14:00,032
Well, we're all gonna die.
What's it mean, anyway?

248
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,470
Life is cheap. People die,
and people have babies.

249
00:14:04,352 --> 00:14:06,305
Every day, they're having babies.

250
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,509
What's with that, kidnapper man?

251
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:10,930
Women in their 40s
are having babies?

252
00:14:11,098 --> 00:14:12,832
Doesn't that seem weird to you?

253
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:16,787
What? No.
I'm not gonna pay the ransom.

254
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:19,089
Hello?

255
00:14:20,816 --> 00:14:21,828
Rude.

256
00:14:24,845 --> 00:14:26,645
Andy, who's having a baby?

257
00:14:31,191 --> 00:14:31,992
No one?

258
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,036
And I'm in the Z's.

259
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:35,791
No one?

260
00:14:37,612 --> 00:14:39,539
Do you have a Facebook page?

261
00:14:39,664 --> 00:14:41,505
Maybe you have some friends there?

262
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:43,413
I don't have a Facebook page.

263
00:14:43,538 --> 00:14:45,839
Clearly, that would be
a waste of time.

264
00:14:48,444 --> 00:14:50,511
What are people saying
when you call?

265
00:14:51,384 --> 00:14:54,618
That the economy's bad,
that you haven't talked for a while.

266
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,015
And many people said to say hello.

267
00:14:58,947 --> 00:15:00,812
You're just trying to be nice.

268
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:04,057
- Everybody hates me.
- Very much.

269
00:15:08,383 --> 00:15:11,990
Did you put something
on those scratches, like... neosporin?

270
00:15:13,636 --> 00:15:14,636
I'm okay.

271
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:16,493
No, you're not.

272
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:19,623
Why do you let her do that to you?

273
00:15:21,543 --> 00:15:22,953
She's abusive.

274
00:15:23,502 --> 00:15:25,879
Roberto,
you do not have to take this.

275
00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:27,271
Rodolfo.

276
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,811
And how often does she hit you...

277
00:15:32,076 --> 00:15:32,886
Rodolfo?

278
00:15:33,694 --> 00:15:34,793
I don't know.

279
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,258
She doesn't mean to hurt me.

280
00:15:37,383 --> 00:15:40,370
I just...
I make her so mad someti...

281
00:15:41,855 --> 00:15:43,188
What the hell is going on?

282
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,689
I'm trying to make
the phone calls, Quinn,

283
00:15:45,814 --> 00:15:47,079
but nobody's paying.

284
00:15:47,204 --> 00:15:48,697
Fine. Then fuck it.

285
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,530
We'll kill her
and sell her organs, okay?

286
00:15:53,032 --> 00:15:54,346
Let's go have sex.

287
00:17:03,201 --> 00:17:04,201
Hello?

288
00:17:04,326 --> 00:17:06,476
Can someone please tell me
what's going on?

289
00:17:12,048 --> 00:17:13,778
Nancy, you need to sign these forms.

290
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:16,326
What am I signing?

291
00:17:16,741 --> 00:17:18,450
It's a consent for a CVS procedure.

292
00:17:19,943 --> 00:17:21,453
I don't even know what that is.

293
00:17:21,676 --> 00:17:23,663
I can't understand
what the doctor is saying.

294
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,079
This is ju...

295
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:28,835
Forget it. I'm going home.

296
00:17:45,078 --> 00:17:46,102
<i>Señora</i> Gonzalez?

297
00:17:48,956 --> 00:17:51,202
I'm not comfortable with this.
I don't even know where I am.

298
00:17:51,327 --> 00:17:53,293
It's like I've been sucked up
into the alien craft

299
00:17:53,418 --> 00:17:54,927
and I'm being probed.

300
00:17:55,052 --> 00:17:57,238
Where are my clothes?
Can someone please bring me...

301
00:17:57,642 --> 00:17:59,115
You have no idea, do you?

302
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,643
This is your baby.

303
00:18:04,768 --> 00:18:07,707
I... totally understand
if you need proof.

304
00:18:08,331 --> 00:18:11,263
Why don't we make an appointment
with a doctor in Ren Mar,

305
00:18:11,388 --> 00:18:13,354
someone who speaks English,

306
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:15,982
actually addresses me
like I'm a human being?

307
00:18:16,331 --> 00:18:18,509
Together. We'll get lunch after.
How about that?

308
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,094
How about that?

309
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:23,097
How about you're Lazarus?

310
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,481
Risen from the dead.

311
00:18:26,977 --> 00:18:29,312
And you will lie back,
open your legs,

312
00:18:29,947 --> 00:18:32,899
and show Dr. Brisa,
the doctor I've chosen,

313
00:18:33,872 --> 00:18:37,153
that in your flat stomach,
there is a baby

314
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,364
that is both male and mine.

315
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:41,273
I want to go home.

316
00:18:41,398 --> 00:18:44,328
If you want to go home,
Cesar will take you.

317
00:18:46,149 --> 00:18:47,336
You want to go?

318
00:18:48,588 --> 00:18:49,588
Go.

319
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,206
That was humiliating.

320
00:19:30,592 --> 00:19:32,752
I know. I'm sorry.
I could not untie you.

321
00:19:32,877 --> 00:19:35,366
You are supposed
to wipe front to back.

322
00:19:35,766 --> 00:19:38,839
- If I get some kind of infection...
- It wasn't exactly a thrill for me.

323
00:19:39,007 --> 00:19:41,652
Just tie her back into the chair
and wash your hands, Rodolfo.

324
00:19:41,777 --> 00:19:43,611
Is this really necessary?

325
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,455
Come on, Quinn. Enough is enough.

326
00:19:46,777 --> 00:19:48,474
You've proven your point.

327
00:19:48,642 --> 00:19:49,716
You're angry.

328
00:19:49,841 --> 00:19:53,348
And I have to make amends
for my many mistakes,

329
00:19:53,473 --> 00:19:54,689
so here is my proposal.

330
00:19:55,109 --> 00:19:56,968
As we all know now, I am broke.

331
00:19:57,777 --> 00:20:01,000
But that doesn't mean
I can't charge, on my credit card,

332
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,801
and worry about it later,

333
00:20:02,926 --> 00:20:05,157
a week at a spa.

334
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:08,661
Let's just forget
all of this silliness

335
00:20:08,829 --> 00:20:12,393
and go have rehydrating facials.

336
00:20:14,084 --> 00:20:16,145
You look a little dry there, honey.

337
00:20:22,027 --> 00:20:24,593
They're gonna saw you open, mom.

338
00:20:25,701 --> 00:20:29,231
They're gonna slice out your corneas,
your kidneys, your lungs.

339
00:20:29,356 --> 00:20:32,328
They probably won't be
too interested in your liver,

340
00:20:32,453 --> 00:20:33,674
considering your past.

341
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,400
But by the time they're through

342
00:20:36,947 --> 00:20:38,899
putting you
into a dozen igloo coolers

343
00:20:39,067 --> 00:20:40,935
and shipping you off
to the black market,

344
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,737
you should net me about $100k.

345
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,680
And then I'll toast your memory...

346
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:49,618
From the deck of my beach house.

347
00:20:51,489 --> 00:20:52,489
Oh, honey.

348
00:20:53,922 --> 00:20:56,582
You can't buy
a beach house for $100k.

349
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,498
And when they cut out your heart, mom,
I think I want to be there...

350
00:21:00,978 --> 00:21:02,709
Just to confirm that you had one.

351
00:21:02,834 --> 00:21:03,799
Jesus.

352
00:21:04,113 --> 00:21:07,649
I survived cancer
and rehab for this.

353
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:12,308
- Fuck it. Can I have a drink?
- You had cancer?

354
00:21:12,476 --> 00:21:15,048
Don't you dare
start feeling sorry for her.

355
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:17,670
Did you have chemo?

356
00:21:17,795 --> 00:21:19,198
Sure... chemo, radiation.

357
00:21:19,323 --> 00:21:22,613
You have more of what made me sleep?
I'll take some of that.

358
00:21:23,124 --> 00:21:24,987
Quinn,
they will not take her organs.

359
00:21:25,733 --> 00:21:28,490
- What?
- She had radiation, chemo.

360
00:21:28,658 --> 00:21:30,498
And a double mastectomy.

361
00:21:31,063 --> 00:21:33,985
They're going to know this
the moment they open her shirt.

362
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,610
Quinn, it's no good.

363
00:21:37,601 --> 00:21:39,752
You fucking bitch!

364
00:21:43,947 --> 00:21:45,215
Enough! Enough!

365
00:21:46,803 --> 00:21:48,510
Get out! Out!

366
00:21:49,173 --> 00:21:51,273
Out of my life!
Out of my tent!

367
00:21:51,932 --> 00:21:53,265
You are a mean person!

368
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,320
Have fun together.

369
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:10,797
Good christ.

370
00:22:11,743 --> 00:22:13,843
Watch out! Incoming! Take cover!

371
00:22:14,155 --> 00:22:15,829
My eyes! My eyes!
I can't see!

372
00:22:16,342 --> 00:22:17,956
If you don't help, you can't come.

373
00:22:18,788 --> 00:22:20,209
Why can't we buy some new stuff?

374
00:22:20,414 --> 00:22:22,649
There was a dead mouse
in that backpack.

375
00:22:25,235 --> 00:22:27,523
- Hey, kid.
- What's wrong with uncle Andy?

376
00:22:27,648 --> 00:22:29,885
He's baking banana bread,
like 13 of them.

377
00:22:30,053 --> 00:22:32,846
He's freaking out
'cause your mom's pregnant.

378
00:22:33,523 --> 00:22:35,582
- Excuse me?
- Knocked up, private!

379
00:22:35,707 --> 00:22:37,837
Baby on board!
Muffin in the muff!

380
00:22:40,406 --> 00:22:41,813
You're just an idiot.

381
00:22:42,405 --> 00:22:44,775
What? What?
I didn't knock her up.

382
00:22:50,217 --> 00:22:52,157
Something smells amazing.

383
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:55,285
They say that pregnant women
have a heightened sense of smell.

384
00:22:55,453 --> 00:22:56,703
Are you talking to me?

385
00:22:56,871 --> 00:22:58,622
Well, I've been thinking.

386
00:22:59,696 --> 00:23:03,700
Just because you've been a slutty,
irresponsible, slutty slut

387
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,547
who had unprotected sex
with a Mexican gangster,

388
00:23:07,715 --> 00:23:09,707
doesn't mean
that we can't be friends, right?

389
00:23:09,832 --> 00:23:11,890
Did you wanna lick the spatula?

390
00:23:12,185 --> 00:23:14,846
- I need to ask you a favor.
- Of course you do.

391
00:23:15,443 --> 00:23:18,058
I need you to take Shane
up to my sister's in the Oakland house.

392
00:23:18,384 --> 00:23:20,852
Jill Price-Gray, with a hyphen?
Bitch face?

393
00:23:21,842 --> 00:23:25,148
- It's the lesser of two evils.
- I'll have to check my schedule.

394
00:23:29,278 --> 00:23:31,170
- I love you, too.
- But not in the good way.

395
00:23:31,295 --> 00:23:33,653
- You're full of shit.
- Ask her yourself.

396
00:23:33,778 --> 00:23:34,991
You're pregnant?

397
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:39,371
See?

398
00:23:39,888 --> 00:23:42,040
- You've got a big mouth.
- You've got a big baby.

399
00:23:42,446 --> 00:23:43,979
And you're how old?

400
00:23:44,263 --> 00:23:47,003
- Women my age have babies.
- So, when's the abortion?

401
00:23:49,069 --> 00:23:50,340
I'm having the baby.

402
00:23:50,593 --> 00:23:54,043
Come on, it's a new life,
it's a new sibling for you guys.

403
00:23:54,693 --> 00:23:57,889
It's the key to keeping her
Mexican boyfriend from murdering us all,

404
00:23:58,156 --> 00:24:00,809
at least until she pops,
and then we flee to Denmark.

405
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:02,767
Dad would be so proud.

406
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,651
Tomorrow Andy's going to take you up
to stay with my sister for a while...

407
00:24:10,235 --> 00:24:11,528
Your aunt Jill.

408
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:13,196
You remember aunt Jill.

409
00:24:13,966 --> 00:24:15,448
Fuck that.

410
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,867
Andy's coming to the forest
with me and Doug.

411
00:24:18,035 --> 00:24:21,496
It's for your own safety,
and that's the end of it. You're going.

412
00:24:21,664 --> 00:24:23,415
Your camping trip will have to wait.

413
00:24:23,968 --> 00:24:27,168
It's not a camping trip. It's business.
I got to get my clones in the ground.

414
00:24:27,336 --> 00:24:31,214
What a bunch of bullshit! He stays,
I get sent to Oakland?! Forget it!

415
00:24:31,382 --> 00:24:33,007
Right. Take them both to Jill's.

416
00:24:33,262 --> 00:24:35,593
No way! I'm not just some kid
you can send to his room!

417
00:24:35,761 --> 00:24:37,387
And I am?! Fuck you!

418
00:24:37,555 --> 00:24:38,404
Totally.

419
00:24:38,529 --> 00:24:40,807
You get one pube,
you think you're a grown-up? Deal.

420
00:24:43,311 --> 00:24:44,477
I'm baking in here!

421
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,153
Don't.

422
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:49,649
- Andy, do something.
- What? I got to check the bread.

423
00:24:49,817 --> 00:24:52,318
- I've got an afro down there, asshole!
- Stop it!

424
00:24:52,486 --> 00:24:54,571
- Surrounding your pussy.
- Gorgeous.

425
00:24:56,741 --> 00:24:58,366
God damn it, I said stop!

426
00:25:00,251 --> 00:25:02,092
Hot! Hot!

427
00:25:03,944 --> 00:25:05,344
My beautiful loaf.

428
00:25:05,928 --> 00:25:07,834
You ruin everything you touch!

429
00:25:09,836 --> 00:25:11,796
- Yeah, you better run!
- Fuck you!

430
00:25:16,897 --> 00:25:18,597
Hey, Nance, you're back.

431
00:25:19,465 --> 00:25:20,698
What's new?

432
00:25:32,735 --> 00:25:33,735
Careful, okay?

433
00:25:34,657 --> 00:25:36,307
You bringing sunscreen?

434
00:25:49,012 --> 00:25:50,662
It'll be okay, sweetie.

435
00:25:51,163 --> 00:25:52,545
It's only temporary.

436
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,680
We'll talk on the phone.

437
00:26:58,167 --> 00:26:59,862
- What's going on?
- Flash mob.

438
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,864
- Why?
- 'cause it's cool.
