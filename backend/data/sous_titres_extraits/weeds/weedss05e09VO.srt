<i>Previously on</i> Weeds...

2
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:09,634
- We can't get our weed back.
- I will help you.

3
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:11,914
After I slam his dick...

4
00:00:12,663 --> 00:00:14,221
- in this drawer.
- I can do this.

5
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:17,197
You're Pretty! will front you
all the products that you need

6
00:00:17,322 --> 00:00:19,477
to put yourself
on the road to financial freedom.

7
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:21,853
I can sell a lot more makeup

8
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:23,355
if I give a free gift.

9
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:25,315
No, I can't steal their weed.

10
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:28,527
No, just tell them that you got
ripped off by black people.

11
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:31,572
- Strike a pose, Harm.
- They really want to have sex.

12
00:00:31,783 --> 00:00:33,449
Both of them? Use condoms.

13
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:38,452
All I know is
some Mexi-cunt screeches at you,

14
00:00:38,665 --> 00:00:40,121
suddenly the marriage is off.

15
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,376
She's just protecting
my public image.

16
00:00:43,707 --> 00:00:46,963
- Because she owns you.
- I am the father of this child.

17
00:00:47,173 --> 00:00:49,632
I couldn't put Esteban's name
on the birth certificate.

18
00:00:49,843 --> 00:00:51,174
So you put my name on it.

19
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,593
I'm not doing this for you.
This is for me.

20
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:55,179
I want something that matters.

21
00:00:55,348 --> 00:00:57,053
This is unacceptable.

22
00:00:57,178 --> 00:00:58,831
My son will be baptized.

23
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,559
Sorry. He's Jewish.

24
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,722
My son's not gonna be raised
by that <i>pendejo</i>!

25
00:01:02,847 --> 00:01:04,897
That <i>pendejo</i> sticks around!

26
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:06,580
And he's not a coward.

By the Fumistes team.
lesfumistes[at]gmail.com

29
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:35,696
I need the bed, Andy.

30
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:37,806
It lives here.

31
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:40,792
I made up the couch for you. Soft...

32
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:42,971
Lots of blankets.

33
00:02:43,506 --> 00:02:44,506
Great.

34
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,581
Enjoy it.

35
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,737
No! Jesus!

36
00:03:15,214 --> 00:03:16,737
So, are you and Esteban over?

37
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:19,198
Looks that way.

38
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:21,367
He's pissed
about the Jew thing, huh?

39
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,774
I have no idea, Andy.
Why don't you ask him?

40
00:03:23,899 --> 00:03:25,870
Can you turn off the light, please?

41
00:03:26,085 --> 00:03:27,736
No. My bed, my rules.

42
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,402
- There's some things I want to say.
- Of course there are.

43
00:03:32,527 --> 00:03:34,754
First, physical contact.

44
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:37,573
If we have to share a bed,
don't even think about spooning me,

45
00:03:37,698 --> 00:03:38,884
that's not happening.

46
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:41,178
Second, pillows...

47
00:03:41,606 --> 00:03:42,839
I use three.

48
00:03:42,964 --> 00:03:45,974
Under the head,
between the legs, and a hugger.

49
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:48,174
Third, night farts...

50
00:03:48,813 --> 00:03:49,813
happen.

51
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,978
Especially since I've been dieting.

52
00:03:52,103 --> 00:03:55,144
So beware when you lift the covers,
and don't expect apologies...

53
00:03:57,191 --> 00:03:58,275
I need sleep!

54
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:02,926
One night of sleep in a bed!
No sounds, no lights, nothing!

55
00:04:04,247 --> 00:04:04,994
Fine.

56
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,412
But just so you know,
I'm not your rebound guy.

57
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:12,851
He's winding up. Go get him.

58
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,420
What about Lupita?

59
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,964
It's her night off.

60
00:04:16,405 --> 00:04:18,012
You wanted to be a daddy.

61
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:21,010
This is your big chance,
night feeding.

62
00:04:21,448 --> 00:04:23,290
It's where the big boys play.

63
00:04:24,377 --> 00:04:27,349
- This is just so you can have the bed.
- Yes, it is.

64
00:04:28,911 --> 00:04:31,405
There's breast milk in the fridge.

65
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,507
You can warm it up in the bottle

66
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,524
in a pot of hot water and test it.

67
00:04:36,164 --> 00:04:38,088
And don't forget to burp him
and sing.

68
00:04:38,213 --> 00:04:40,537
He likes that.
<i>Me and Mrs. Jones.</i>

69
00:04:41,032 --> 00:04:41,864
Seriously?

70
00:04:43,156 --> 00:04:44,546
We got a thing...

71
00:04:45,907 --> 00:04:46,922
going on.

72
00:05:09,105 --> 00:05:10,792
Can you check on the baby?

73
00:05:12,014 --> 00:05:13,151
I fed him.

74
00:05:13,888 --> 00:05:15,146
He probably pooped.

75
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:16,884
That's how babies work.

76
00:05:17,454 --> 00:05:19,610
I was thinking
that you could handle the poop

77
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:22,627
and I would amuse him
by making funny faces.

78
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,143
You can make funny faces
while you wipe his butt.

79
00:05:26,728 --> 00:05:27,993
I'm gonna pump.

80
00:05:40,854 --> 00:05:41,757
What?!

81
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:43,478
I just changed him!

82
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,389
He's hungry again.

83
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:48,096
He wants his mommy.

84
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:51,102
Well, I'm empty...
from the last pumping.

85
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:52,845
Go pop a bottle in his mouth.

86
00:05:54,665 --> 00:05:57,273
- You're trying to break me, aren't you?
- No!

87
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:59,096
This is what parenting is.

88
00:05:59,802 --> 00:06:02,109
Shit and food.

89
00:06:03,158 --> 00:06:04,158
Shit...

90
00:06:05,104 --> 00:06:06,532
and food... mostly shit.

91
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:08,631
Wiping shit.

92
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:10,995
Keeping them away from shit.

93
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,132
Minimizing the external shit.

94
00:06:13,988 --> 00:06:15,374
It's parenting shit.

95
00:06:15,585 --> 00:06:16,794
What about love?

96
00:06:17,737 --> 00:06:19,286
It's there, it's just...

97
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,875
buried under all the... shit.

98
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:24,821
I still feel used.

99
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:28,494
Talk to me after you've had something
clamped onto your breast

100
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:30,055
every 3 to 4 hours.

101
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:32,602
You think I never had
my nipples clamped?

102
00:06:32,987 --> 00:06:34,434
Ashley Stepanski...

103
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:37,054
I don't care. Go.
He's crying. Go, go.

104
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,416
So, after the judge signs off
on the release form,

105
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,764
and after I get the pot back
from the cop at the evidence locker,

106
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:53,400
I put it in a black duffel.

107
00:06:53,525 --> 00:06:55,998
I bought one just for this.
I'm not gonna charge you for it.

108
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:58,043
Anyway, I threw it
in the back of my car.

109
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,878
But on my way home,
Marine View Road is closed.

110
00:14:20,169 --> 00:14:23,093
He'll be fine.
Rite of passage.

111
00:14:23,927 --> 00:14:25,454
Granted, not...

112
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,594
exactly the Bar Mitzvah
that he should have had.

113
00:14:29,425 --> 00:14:30,738
A moment of silence, please,

114
00:14:30,863 --> 00:14:33,269
while I continue to enjoy
the sweet caress of alcohol

115
00:14:33,394 --> 00:14:35,332
for the first time in far too long.

116
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:44,508
Can I talk now?

117
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:51,348
Now?

118
00:14:53,074 --> 00:14:57,078
So, fucking male yeast infection.
That's crazy, right?

119
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,342
Who knew? It's like
a cross-pollination sort of thing...

120
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,400
Mad cow, hoof and mouth.

121
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:06,321
The human body is a complex
and mysterious experiment.

122
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:07,405
It's a sewer.

123
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,893
You're still reeling
from that diaper change.

124
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,619
That wasn't human.
You didn't see that.

125
00:15:13,972 --> 00:15:15,081
I've seen it.

126
00:15:17,201 --> 00:15:20,252
Well, he's Lupita's problem
for the next couple hours.

127
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,455
He's nobody's problem.

128
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:26,055
He's my son.

129
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,610
My third son.
My third... son.

130
00:15:31,989 --> 00:15:34,002
The little bastard saved my life.

131
00:15:34,435 --> 00:15:36,017
And he's pretty damn cute, right?

132
00:15:36,305 --> 00:15:37,305
Like...

133
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,835
sick crazy cute.

134
00:15:41,129 --> 00:15:42,829
These drinks are strong.

135
00:15:43,162 --> 00:15:44,852
Why can't babies just talk?

136
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:47,845
They come out knowing how to breathe.
Talking should be a...

137
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,739
What do you call?
Involuntary action.

138
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,366
- For you, it is.
- Imagine

139
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,411
if Stevie could say,
"hey, I got something in the pants.

140
00:15:54,937 --> 00:15:56,663
"Put me on the potty, stat."

141
00:15:56,788 --> 00:15:58,707
You'll learn to read the signs.

142
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,961
God, I should have pumped.

143
00:16:04,408 --> 00:16:07,356
- So, they hurt or...?
- Yes. Hurt.

144
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,160
- Do you want to go?
- No.

145
00:16:11,506 --> 00:16:14,639
It's my first time out.
Hang on a second.

146
00:16:40,361 --> 00:16:41,361
No way.

147
00:16:46,164 --> 00:16:47,166
Fuck!

148
00:16:50,883 --> 00:16:51,883
Okay.

149
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:55,159
Okay, relax.

150
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,905
Oh, god damn it.
Fuck it all to hell.

151
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,923
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

152
00:17:20,233 --> 00:17:21,775
Hi. Yeah.

153
00:17:22,586 --> 00:17:24,236
Could you come in here?

154
00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:27,109
In the... bathroom, yeah.

155
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:34,289
Just shut up.
Just come in here. Bye.

156
00:17:38,234 --> 00:17:39,307
My dream is dead.

157
00:17:39,817 --> 00:17:41,017
Paradise lost.

158
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:43,669
We'll start over.

159
00:17:43,794 --> 00:17:47,167
I'll grow in the upstairs closet.
I did it once, I can do it again.

160
00:17:47,292 --> 00:17:50,193
This is America. You get one chance.
You blow it, that's it.

161
00:17:50,922 --> 00:17:54,906
<i>Adiós</i>, losers.
I am out of here for good.

162
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,700
For great.

163
00:17:57,842 --> 00:17:59,035
New Condo.

164
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,871
Ocean view. Covered parking.

165
00:18:02,343 --> 00:18:04,040
Saltwater pool.

166
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,002
Good for you, Mrs. Hodes.

167
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,461
Thanks for stopping by.

168
00:18:09,235 --> 00:18:11,798
- Enjoy packing.
- Thank you.

169
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,384
- Yeah, good for you. Who you fucking?
- Nobody.

170
00:18:15,157 --> 00:18:19,161
I did this all on my own,
selling You're Pretty! cosmetics.

171
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,315
And I am selling a shitload.

172
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,390
That bullshit makeup company?

173
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:27,105
Yeah, that bullshit
is buying mama a new life.

174
00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:29,791
God, it's good to be back on top.

175
00:18:31,815 --> 00:18:34,350
- Engorged. I'm engorged.
- "I'm engorged"?

176
00:18:34,475 --> 00:18:37,407
Engorged. It hurts.
Please, I need you to suck it out.

177
00:18:38,494 --> 00:18:40,243
- Can't we just...?
- I tried!

178
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,120
- Maybe...
- I tried.

179
00:18:42,591 --> 00:18:44,137
Please, be the baby!

180
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,369
I've done my share
of role-playing before.

181
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:48,710
Some crazy, weird shit.

182
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,642
- I was a werewolf...
- Shut up and suck!

183
00:18:50,767 --> 00:18:51,967
Wait. Hold it.

184
00:18:53,628 --> 00:18:56,428
- What's it gonna taste like?
- Rum and milk.

185
00:18:59,246 --> 00:19:01,270
Here we go. Lips to nips.

186
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:11,064
- No teeth! No!
- Sorry. Sorry.

187
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:22,702
Spit, spit.

188
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,720
That's a really interesting flavor.

189
00:19:31,845 --> 00:19:34,798
I imagined a spout,
but it's like a showerhead. It's like

190
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:36,488
You swallowed!

191
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,226
Yeah, well...
I don't want to be a hypocrite.

192
00:19:52,705 --> 00:19:54,442
Why is the bed moving?

193
00:19:55,973 --> 00:19:58,113
I guess we had an earthquake.

194
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:01,491
You're jerking off.

195
00:20:02,184 --> 00:20:03,326
I couldn't sleep.

196
00:20:03,962 --> 00:20:06,162
Well, take a fucking Ambien.

197
00:20:10,274 --> 00:20:11,974
That's what I was doing.

198
00:20:12,693 --> 00:20:13,974
Nature's Ambien.

199
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:17,165
The old tried-and-true male way:
cum, sleep.

200
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:19,558
I'm right here!

201
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:23,138
Well, I'm engorged. It hurts.
I need you to suck it out.

202
00:20:23,562 --> 00:20:26,262
- Be the baby.
- This is too fucking weird.

203
00:20:27,943 --> 00:20:29,602
I've seen you in the bathtub.

204
00:20:30,308 --> 00:20:32,224
You watched me fuck your sister.

205
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:33,908
I suckled you.

206
00:20:34,308 --> 00:20:36,308
But this is too weird for you?

207
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:40,629
Which is why we should cling to any
last shred of normalcy that we can.

208
00:20:40,754 --> 00:20:41,656
Okay.

209
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:44,324
Just be two normal people.

210
00:20:44,851 --> 00:20:47,075
Normal brother/sisters-in-law

211
00:20:47,561 --> 00:20:49,638
sharing a house and a bed together,

212
00:20:49,763 --> 00:20:51,913
raising a Mexican-American child.

213
00:20:52,677 --> 00:20:54,477
- Just normal.
- Exactly.

214
00:20:54,952 --> 00:20:57,505
Which means
masturbating on our own time.

215
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,212
'cause I'm swimming in that
these days.

216
00:21:00,337 --> 00:21:04,341
Today was a bath of me time
and personal space.

217
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,308
Sounds like a feeding.

218
00:21:09,305 --> 00:21:13,199
I'll get this. Go ahead.
Take your Andy time.

219
00:21:15,344 --> 00:21:17,544
Can Andy time be about 15 minutes?

220
00:21:18,036 --> 00:21:20,436
Just keep it
on that side of the bed.

221
00:21:22,311 --> 00:21:23,761
Just so you know...

222
00:21:24,337 --> 00:21:28,287
If you want to rub one out in bed,
I totally get that, and I'll stay

223
00:21:28,733 --> 00:21:29,913
way over on my side.

224
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,174
You won't even know I'm here.

225
00:21:33,189 --> 00:21:34,834
I just had a baby

226
00:21:35,407 --> 00:21:36,593
less than two weeks ago.

227
00:21:36,718 --> 00:21:39,007
The father of my child might be
gone for good,

228
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:42,079
so rubbing one out isn't exactly
at the top of my list, but thank you.

229
00:21:42,204 --> 00:21:43,635
Just wanted to reciprocate.

230
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:48,890
- When you... You weren't thinking...
- Don't flatter yourself.

231
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:51,667
Here.

232
00:21:52,235 --> 00:21:53,485
For when you...

233
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,340
burp.

234
00:22:00,698 --> 00:22:03,738
Go ahead, sweetheart.
Share. This is a safe place.

235
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,243
Well, he says
that I can't do anything on my own.

236
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,750
He says no one will hire me.

237
00:22:12,786 --> 00:22:14,791
That I'm too stupid to have a job.

238
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,543
He calls me dummy-no-jobby.

239
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:21,855
And whenever his friends come over,
he...

240
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,426
He what?

241
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,053
Locks you in the closet?

242
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:28,849
Dresses you like a maid?

243
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,349
Go ahead, finish the story.
What happened?

244
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:33,893
May I help you, sir?

245
00:22:34,178 --> 00:22:36,938
Yeah, I want to make a lot of money
selling your face chemicals.

246
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:41,106
Well, we don't carry products for men,
so please leave the way you came in.

247
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,386
What?
You're kicking me out?

248
00:22:43,648 --> 00:22:46,030
'cause I'm not some bored housewife?
What's that?

249
00:22:46,314 --> 00:22:47,360
Sir,

250
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:51,202
You're Pretty! is for women
who have been marginalized,

251
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,412
disenfranchised

252
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,456
and who have never been allowed
the opportunity to succeed.

253
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,709
Well, I need
the opportunity to succeed.

254
00:22:58,895 --> 00:23:00,045
Please leave.

255
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:04,202
Okay, if you wouldn't mind opening
your incentive booklets to page 5.

256
00:23:04,327 --> 00:23:06,459
Okay, okay. I see the game here.

257
00:23:06,584 --> 00:23:09,526
And I'm gonna sue you
for sexual harassment. How about that?

258
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:12,308
- You mean discrimination?
- That, too.

259
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:15,310
I demand you let men sell makeup.

260
00:23:20,589 --> 00:23:21,494
Look, asshole.

261
00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:25,028
I will hook you up with a starter kit
if you get out. You're blowing my gig.

262
00:23:25,423 --> 00:23:27,030
Starter kits are for pussies.

263
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:28,948
You think you can handle
a full order?

264
00:23:29,224 --> 00:23:31,455
Damn right, full order. Fill me up.

265
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,122
And I want one of those booklets too,
so I have incentive.

266
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:36,582
- You single?
- I dig snatch.

267
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:37,707
Me too.

268
00:23:38,201 --> 00:23:39,334
You want to go out?

269
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:42,211
Buy three full orders,
and I'll think about it.

270
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:44,907
Okay?
You have a pretty day now.

271
00:23:46,209 --> 00:23:47,216
Very pretty.

272
00:23:56,885 --> 00:23:58,140
Pilar was right.

273
00:23:59,682 --> 00:24:02,271
I should be happy.

274
00:24:03,128 --> 00:24:04,840
I should enjoy myself.

275
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,984
Life's too short, Cesar.

276
00:24:10,265 --> 00:24:12,186
You should smile more.

277
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,451
He drank 4 ounces.

278
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:28,660
Nice.

279
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:33,346
Think that'll translate
into 4 hours?

280
00:24:34,137 --> 00:24:35,473
Let us pray.

281
00:24:35,895 --> 00:24:37,071
I can't.

282
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,542
I'm too tired.

283
00:24:50,643 --> 00:24:51,697
Interesting.

284
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,491
How did you get in here?

285
00:24:53,883 --> 00:24:55,871
You are in bed together.

286
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:58,891
Chill out. Look. Pillow wall.

287
00:24:59,884 --> 00:25:02,417
A small house. Few rooms.

288
00:25:03,466 --> 00:25:05,336
It's fine.
I'm not threatened.

289
00:25:06,707 --> 00:25:08,923
Well, maybe you should
be threatened.

290
00:25:10,811 --> 00:25:13,713
I have something to tell you.

291
00:25:14,393 --> 00:25:16,848
- So, tell me.
- Alone.

292
00:25:18,649 --> 00:25:21,015
I'm not leaving. This is my bed.

293
00:25:21,551 --> 00:25:23,146
Say what you have to say.

294
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:27,519
Marry me.

295
00:25:31,178 --> 00:25:33,156
We've had this discussion before.

296
00:25:34,642 --> 00:25:37,160
I would like to have it
one more time.

297
00:25:38,234 --> 00:25:39,579
Never gonna happen, pal.

298
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,039
Andy, would you give us a second?

299
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:46,274
- It's my fucking room!
- Okay.

300
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:49,881
Let's go downstairs for a minute.

301
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:51,833
Yeah. Do that.

302
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:54,844
I'm going back to bed.

303
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,030
I need my beauty rest.

304
00:26:12,916 --> 00:26:14,466
What are they saying?

305
00:26:15,248 --> 00:26:16,407
I can't hear that well.

306
00:26:17,965 --> 00:26:19,696
I'll give you a dollar
if you go find out.

307
00:26:19,821 --> 00:26:22,121
- What am I gonna do with a dollar?
- All right, 20 bucks.

308
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:24,147
- Why don't you go?
- 'cause I don't care!

309
00:26:24,272 --> 00:26:26,866
Now get the fuck out there
and find out what's going on!

310
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:32,263
I'm gonna wind up
secretly engaged to you

311
00:26:32,388 --> 00:26:34,884
until one day Steven asks me
who his real father is?

312
00:26:35,133 --> 00:26:36,177
We will get married

313
00:26:37,285 --> 00:26:38,285
now.

314
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,556
Steven will know who his father is.

315
00:26:40,902 --> 00:26:42,752
Suddenly everything's fine.

316
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:47,522
Last night I had dinner with the woman
I'm supposed to be with.

317
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,230
Okay. Fuck you.

318
00:26:51,585 --> 00:26:54,487
She knows the right people.
She says the right things.

319
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:56,555
She wears the right clothes.

320
00:26:57,651 --> 00:27:00,034
She's the perfect candidate's wife.

321
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:02,328
But she turned you down,
so now you're here?

322
00:27:03,335 --> 00:27:04,497
I love you.

323
00:27:05,113 --> 00:27:06,263
So I'm here.

324
00:27:06,388 --> 00:27:08,338
And you love me. So I'm here.

325
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:11,289
And we have
a beautiful baby together.

326
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:13,096
So I am here.

327
00:27:13,947 --> 00:27:15,547
And I am staying here.

328
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:18,385
Get down!

329
00:27:23,518 --> 00:27:24,518
Mom?
