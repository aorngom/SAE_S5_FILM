1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:03,369
You can't assume too much about anything
from the outside.

2
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:06,090
Like a house... you have
to get inside and explore.

3
00:00:06,538 --> 00:00:08,352
You never know
what you might find.

4
00:00:08,688 --> 00:00:09,743
Hey, mom, i think
that this might be

5
00:00:10,006 --> 00:00:11,359
one of our more successful
showings ever.

6
00:00:11,662 --> 00:00:14,337
I found ham and that mustard
that i love so much.

7
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,534
And as usual,
i'm doing all the work.

8
00:00:19,957 --> 00:00:21,285
You know, i should have
just left you in the car

9
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:23,309
with some water
and cracked a window.

10
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,190
Well,
i'm starving, okay?

11
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:27,853
- We have been here all day.
- We've been here 20 minutes!

12
00:00:28,301 --> 00:00:30,957
I am just trying
to build a business

13
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:32,741
that we can be proud of.

14
00:00:33,277 --> 00:00:35,776
But you know, i'm not angry.
I- i'm just disappointed.

15
00:00:36,357 --> 00:00:38,285
Okay. I am not 5 years old.

16
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,110
Do you really think that
that's gonna work?

17
00:00:42,253 --> 00:00:43,831
Because it's...
it's not gonna work.

18
00:00:45,688 --> 00:00:48,058
Okay, fine.
I'll try harder. God!

19
00:00:48,537 --> 00:00:49,594
You got mustard
on your face.

20
00:00:51,193 --> 00:00:52,090
Go away from me!

21
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:56,113
Okay.

22
00:00:58,697 --> 00:01:00,705
Hello. Welcome. I'm samantha.

23
00:01:01,433 --> 00:01:03,035
- Would you please sign in?
- Lindsey.

24
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:05,282
Hi.
We really like the house.

25
00:01:05,657 --> 00:01:07,449
Oh, good, good.
Let's see what we have here.

26
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:10,521
It's nice. It's, uh, very much
like one we're interested

27
00:01:10,786 --> 00:01:13,827
- over in elk ridge.
- Elk ridge?

28
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,364
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

29
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,300
- You do not want to live in elk ridge.
- Why? What's wrong with elk ridge?

30
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,780
What isn't
wrong with elk ridge?

31
00:01:21,413 --> 00:01:23,356
Look, lindsey,
you seem a lot like me,

32
00:01:23,724 --> 00:01:27,548
and walnut valley is really
the place for people like us.

33
00:01:28,173 --> 00:01:28,853
People like us?

34
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,612
You mean because elk ridge
is a black neighborhood?

35
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,164
What? Wait. It is?

36
00:01:33,573 --> 00:01:34,969
- As if you didn't know.
- No. I...

37
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:36,988
- people like you make me sick.
- No, i don't!

38
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:38,700
What did... what did i do?

39
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:40,889
- Roger?
- I don't understand what you're...

40
00:01:41,217 --> 00:01:42,234
this is my husband.

41
00:01:43,361 --> 00:01:46,579
Oh. Hi. Hello.
Look, i-i really...

42
00:01:46,963 --> 00:01:48,643
i didn't know about elk ridge.
I've never even been there.

43
00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:50,547
Okay? Not that i wouldn't
go there. It's just that...

44
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,234
look, i'm just trying
to sell you a house, okay?

45
00:01:53,682 --> 00:01:58,307
I mean, i love black...
african... american...

46
00:01:59,114 --> 00:02:00,187
black people.

47
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:04,042
You want a ham sandwich?
Wait a minute.

48
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:06,354
Ham... that's not offensive,
is it? Right? Mom!

49
00:02:07,218 --> 00:02:08,218
I don't even
want to be doing this!

50
00:02:09,746 --> 00:02:11,611

52
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:19,333
They called me a racist.

53
00:02:19,334 --> 00:02:22,532
I am not racist.
I voted obama, you know?

54
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:26,633
I- i watch "oprah. " My life
is full of black people.

55
00:02:26,634 --> 00:02:28,833
Mrs. Butterworth...
she's technically black.

56
00:02:28,834 --> 00:02:31,100
Do you actually know
any black people?

57
00:02:31,101 --> 00:02:34,333
I feel like i know oprah.

58
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:37,399
So what? What, if i don't
know any black people,

59
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,432
then i'm automatically
a racist?

60
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:42,833
It's not like you have any black
friends, right? Uh, five. No, four now.

61
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:44,866
Shondra and i
had a falling out

62
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:47,367
when i didn't invite her
to my kwanzaa party, but...

63
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:50,666
don't look at me. I'm dating
tony dane... black and gay.

64
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,566
Two birds.
Wait a minute.

65
00:02:52,567 --> 00:02:55,499
Before the accident, did i do
anything that was racist?

66
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,300
No. A black guy,
a white guy and two asians

67
00:02:58,301 --> 00:03:00,866
were in the mailroom one day. Okay.

68
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:03,133
You fired them all.

69
00:03:03,134 --> 00:03:06,866
Oh. I'm sorry. I thought
you were telling me a joke.

70
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:09,532
Ooh! Andrea,
your boyfriend's on tv!

71
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:12,200
Oh! Oh, turn it up, turn it up.
Maybe he'll mention me.

72
00:03:12,201 --> 00:03:15,033
Well, it looks like
pro basketballer tony dane

73
00:03:15,034 --> 00:03:17,833
is giving new meaning
to the term "swish. "

74
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:19,933
Caught here by paparazzi,
the great dane

75
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:22,367
is making a full-court press

76
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,033
on an unidentified
male companion.

77
00:03:25,034 --> 00:03:28,432
Representatives for dane could
not be reached for comment,

78
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:31,100
but an unnamed source
within the organization

79
00:03:31,101 --> 00:03:34,466
did confirm that thatho was taken last
night. Oh, my god. It's all over...

80
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:38,200
the private jets, thparties,
the club openings.

81
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:40,200
Oh, sweetie,
it's gonna be okay.

82
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:43,933
I- i'm sure you'll find another
gay guy to pretend to love you.

83
00:03:43,934 --> 00:03:46,133
Not like this one.

84
00:03:46,134 --> 00:03:47,699
Hey.

85
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,033
Ms. Newly.

86
00:03:49,034 --> 00:03:51,333
Frank.

87
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:53,432
Frank! You're black!

88
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,432
Shh! Keep it quiet. I'm trying
to get off for passover.

89
00:03:56,433 --> 00:04:00,033
No! No, i thought i didn't
have any black friends,

90
00:04:00,034 --> 00:04:03,033
but you're black,
and we're friends.

91
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,933
No, ma'am.

92
00:04:04,934 --> 00:04:07,633
No? 'cause you...
you seem kind of black.

93
00:04:07,634 --> 00:04:09,466
I mean we are not friends.

94
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:12,432
Of course we are.
W- we see each other every day.

95
00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:14,432
We talk. We're friends.

96
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:18,200
What's my last name?

97
00:04:18,201 --> 00:04:20,566
It's, um...

98
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:23,333
where am i from?
What's my wife's name?

99
00:04:23,334 --> 00:04:25,532
What's my son's name?

100
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:28,200
Marcello.
Close. I don't have a son.

101
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:32,699
Fine. I'm not sure what it is
you're doing, miss newly, but don't.

102
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,000
Friendships grow through time
and shared experiences.

103
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:38,166
You carry my groceries.

104
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:40,100
You sign for my packages.

105
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:43,300
I mean, if those aren't shared experiences,
then i... good night, ms. Newly.

106
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:45,966
Samantha.
Ms. Newly.

107
00:04:45,967 --> 00:04:48,599
Frank, seriously,
you don't think we're friends?

108
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,367
Because that's
just not okay with me.

109
00:04:51,368 --> 00:04:52,966
You know what?

110
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:57,599
I'm not gonna stop
until you and i are true-blue,

111
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,633
pick-me-up-in-the-middle-
of-the-night,

112
00:04:59,634 --> 00:05:01,833
drive-me-to-the-airport,

113
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,866
hold-my-hair-back-when-i-puke
kind of friends.

114
00:05:04,867 --> 00:05:07,432
But i've already done
all those things for you.

115
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:10,900
Not as friends.

116
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:13,932
Hey.

117
00:05:13,933 --> 00:05:16,300
Oh, hey.
Look at that on your lip.

118
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:19,400
That's, uh, it's, uh...
oh, shoot, what is that called?

119
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:22,266
It's, um, it's like a mustache
but not one.

120
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:25,500
Joke all you want,
but you don't have a say in it.

121
00:05:25,501 --> 00:05:32,899
You're not my girlfriend. And
apparently, you don't plan on having one.

122
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,133
Hi, frank. Wassup?

123
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:38,667
Hey, todd,
it's my friend frank.

124
00:05:38,668 --> 00:05:41,400
Is there any reason why
you wouldn't come down

125
00:05:41,401 --> 00:05:43,966
and sign for this? Because
all the fun is up here.

126
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:46,133
Come on. Join us.
We've got food,

127
00:05:46,134 --> 00:05:49,099
and we have fun.
We got frank. It's "f" day.

128
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,999
I can think of many other words
that begin with "f,"

129
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,700
but i'd get fired.
"Fired"... there's another "f. "

130
00:05:55,701 --> 00:05:57,400
Sam?
Yeah?

131
00:05:57,401 --> 00:06:00,667
You didn't order my black
bean sauce again. I'm sorry.

132
00:06:00,668 --> 00:06:02,667
You always make sure
your order's right,

133
00:06:02,668 --> 00:06:05,133
but you never think of me.
I always think of you.

134
00:06:05,134 --> 00:06:08,799
Mm. I just think of myself first.
Some people find that adorable.

135
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,366
Well, frank doesn't.
He'll come around.

136
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:13,999
He won't come around. He doesn't want to
be your friend. Yeah, well, you know what?

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,700
He also didn't want to drag out
our dead christmas tree,

138
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:19,832
but he did that. I'll wear him
down. Why is this your project?

139
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,832
Because for
the last two years,

140
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,832
i have been walking
past that man,

141
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,300
and i know nothing about him.
What does that say about me?

142
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:28,633
Exactly. About you.

143
00:06:28,634 --> 00:06:31,033
You want more friends?

144
00:06:31,034 --> 00:06:34,400
Maybe think of their needs, what they
want. You know what? You're right.

145
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:36,767
And what frank wants
is to be left alone.

146
00:06:36,768 --> 00:06:43,533
I'm gonna bake him a pie.

147
00:06:43,534 --> 00:06:48,233
* my friend frank *

148
00:06:48,234 --> 00:06:53,433
* how are you tonight? *

149
00:06:53,434 --> 00:06:57,199
oh, hi. Can you please hold this for
a second, please? Give me the purse.

150
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,899
No, i've got the purse fine. Just... can you
hold the pie? Give me the purse. Hurry up.

151
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,767
What? Oh, no.
Come on. No.

152
00:07:02,768 --> 00:07:05,333
I can't have you do this right now.
Oh, when would be a good time for you?

153
00:07:05,334 --> 00:07:07,500
No, you don't understand
what i'm going through,

154
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:10,333
and i really... i cannot
have you reinforcing

155
00:07:10,334 --> 00:07:12,433
a racial stereotype, okay?
I'm really sorry.

156
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:14,700
You know, if you can't look
past the color of my skin

157
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,700
and see me as a man
stealing your purse,

158
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:19,266
i feel sorry for you. How about
this... give me your address,

159
00:07:19,267 --> 00:07:23,366
and then i'll send you something later? Okay,
uh, it's 4-2-2... give me the damn purse!

160
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:25,366
What? No!
I just got the... but i...

161
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:28,700
there's a card in there
for fra... for frank.

162
00:07:28,701 --> 00:07:30,767
Hello, andrea.

163
00:07:30,768 --> 00:07:32,633
Hello, gin.

164
00:07:32,634 --> 00:07:35,099
Andrea, it's me.
Heard about tony.

165
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,133
You passed on
a relationship with me

166
00:07:37,134 --> 00:07:38,999
to be with a gay guy.

167
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,966
Believe me, that's the least
of the reasons i passed on you.

168
00:07:41,967 --> 00:07:44,966
Wow, it must be rough knowing
you turned a guy gay.

169
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:47,966
I didn't turn anyone gay.
Hey, i'm not judging, okay?

170
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,700
In fact, i'm willing to let you try
it out on me. Tony was already gay.

171
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:54,199
He asked me to pretend
to be his girlfriend.

172
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,700
Okay, so what was in it
for you? What do you think?

173
00:07:57,701 --> 00:08:00,166
The limos, the parties,

174
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:02,533
photographs in "us" weekly.

175
00:08:02,534 --> 00:08:05,199
I was so airbrushed
and pretty...

176
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,033
and happy.

177
00:08:07,034 --> 00:08:08,700
And now it's all gone.

178
00:08:08,701 --> 00:08:10,667
I'm meeting
with his people tomorrow

179
00:08:10,668 --> 00:08:12,667
so they can give me
the big kiss-off.

180
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:15,166
I think i'm gonna miss
the airbrushing the most.

181
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:17,333
Man, you are so afraid
to be with someone.

182
00:08:17,334 --> 00:08:19,866
What are you talkin' about...
afraid?

183
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:23,099
Of being seen by someone
who sees what you need

184
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,033
and can really
give it to you...

185
00:08:25,034 --> 00:08:27,366
to take you in his arms

186
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:48,733
and really, truly love you.

187
00:08:48,734 --> 00:08:51,866
You want your olive back?

188
00:08:51,867 --> 00:08:53,932
Frank, you didn't have
to call the police.

189
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,866
I only told you
that i got mugged

190
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:58,199
because i needed a ride home.
I want this guy caught.

191
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,600
My family lives
in this neighborhood.

192
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:02,600
You do not live
in this neighborhood.

193
00:09:02,601 --> 00:09:06,199
What are you doing in this neighborhood?
You're welcome for the lovely pie, frank.

194
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,199
What a nice friend.
I did not ask you for pie.

195
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,533
I did not ask you for balloons.
I did not ask to be your friend.

196
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:15,033
You're talking like
a dr. Seuss character.

197
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:19,033
Just a little bit. Look, why don't we
both just admit what this is all about?

198
00:09:19,034 --> 00:09:21,533
What? You're only pursuing
this so you can ease your guilt

199
00:09:21,534 --> 00:09:24,300
about not having a black
friend. No, that is not true!

200
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:27,300
I just want to be your friend,
frank. Period.

201
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:29,166
It's not about color.

202
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:31,966
That is everybody else's
hang-up. I have no guilt.

203
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:35,366
Okay? Thank you for coming, officers.

204
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:38,099
This here is ms.
Newly, the victim. Yeah.

205
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,600
Hello, ma'am. Can you tell us
what your attacker looked like? Hi.

206
00:09:41,601 --> 00:09:49,066
Yeah. He... he, um...

207
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:51,566
white guy.

208
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:53,700
Very white.

209
00:09:53,701 --> 00:09:57,832
Blindingly so. Yeah.

210
00:10:01,465 --> 00:10:01,465
Morning, frank.

211
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,966
Uh, could you... could you
call me a cab to my mom's house?

212
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:10,166
I'm sorry. Todd is still
picking up my car at your house.

213
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:12,200
And he's just taking forever.

214
00:10:12,201 --> 00:10:14,200
He thinks
it's really funny

215
00:10:14,201 --> 00:10:17,499
to change all my radio stations
to gospel.

216
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,633
* hallelujah! *

217
00:10:20,634 --> 00:10:22,599
sorry.

218
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,166
Thank you for the pie.

219
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,100
Oh. You're welcome.

220
00:10:28,101 --> 00:10:29,866
Was it good?

221
00:10:29,867 --> 00:10:32,866
The important thing is
you were reaching out,

222
00:10:32,867 --> 00:10:34,666
and i'm sorry.

223
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,833
I've become accustomed
to shutting people out.

224
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:39,566
To your offer of kindness,

225
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:42,000
then you wouldn't have
needed to go to my home,

226
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:44,333
and you wouldn't
have been attacked.

227
00:10:44,334 --> 00:10:46,432
Did you try the pie?

228
00:10:46,433 --> 00:10:49,000
The important thing is...

229
00:10:49,001 --> 00:10:49,633
if you still want
to be friends,

230
00:10:49,634 --> 00:10:51,432
que seamos amigos.

231
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:54,300
I suppose that would be okay,
ms. Newly.

232
00:10:54,301 --> 00:10:57,367
Thok..

233
00:10:57,368 --> 00:10:59,100
what?

234
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:01,100
Samantha.

235
00:11:01,101 --> 00:11:03,699
Yay! Oh! No, no. Get
off of me. No. Come on.

236
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,499
Oh, yes. I'm gonna grab...

237
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:10,133
so... mr. Tony dane couldn't
be bothered to show up, huh?

238
00:11:10,134 --> 00:11:12,766
Fine. Let's do this.

239
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,133
First, i get to keep
all the gifts.

240
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:17,333
Second, i still want
to go to the grammys.

241
00:11:17,334 --> 00:11:20,699
I was looking forward to that.
And i don't care how

242
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,966
you arrange it, but i want
to meet tiger woods,

243
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:25,966
james gandolfini and captain
jack sparrow. Are you finished?

244
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:28,466
And i want to carry
the olympic torch. Okay, now.

245
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:30,432
Here's our counteroffer.

246
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:33,100
Andrea belladonna,

247
00:11:33,101 --> 00:11:41,532
will you marry tony dane?

248
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:44,666
Hey. Hey!
Where's your hideous red coat?

249
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:47,333
If i have to wear
the hideous red coat, so do you.

250
00:11:47,334 --> 00:11:50,466
The showing has been cancelled.
The sellers fired us. What? Why?

251
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:53,233
Remember the potential buyers...
that couple you insulted?

252
00:11:53,234 --> 00:11:55,233
Well, they apparently
own the hottest

253
00:11:55,234 --> 00:11:57,233
new steak house in town,
and they're telling

254
00:11:57,234 --> 00:12:00,000
all their customers that
we're a racist company. What?

255
00:12:00,001 --> 00:12:01,532
Oh, and two other clients
have fired us.

256
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:03,900
Okay, well, you know what?
You can't blame that on me,

257
00:12:03,901 --> 00:12:07,766
'cause there could be a million
reasons why they fired us.

258
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:13,166
First of all, you know, we're not very good. You are
going to convince that couple you are not a racist...

259
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:15,200
unless, i don't know,
maybe you really are.

260
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,566
Oh.
I mean, when you were a baby,

261
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:20,066
you cried all the way through
"the jeffersons. " Mom!

262
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:23,432
And you don't have any
black friends. Uh, yes, i do.

263
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:28,000
I have frank. If they
could see that, then...

264
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:30,100
this is a real nice steak house. Mm-hmm

265
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:33,432
thank you for inviting me. Yeah. Yeah,
sure. You know, when you do real estate,

266
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:35,267
you don't just
know about houses.

267
00:12:35,268 --> 00:12:37,300
You know about steak houses,
you know?

268
00:12:37,301 --> 00:12:40,766
Oh, excuse me, miss. Um, hi.
Can i please talk to the owners?

269
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:44,166
I, um, i don't like my steak, so...
i'm sorry. I can get you another one.

270
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:48,033
No. I'll eat it. I just need to... just need
to tell someone. Okay, i'll get the chef.

271
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:51,066
Oh, no. No, no, no.

272
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:53,866
I need to talk to the owners.
Okay, i'll see what i can do.

273
00:12:53,867 --> 00:12:55,666
No.
Skirt.

274
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:57,666
All right, thanks.

275
00:12:57,667 --> 00:13:00,200
This is fun, huh?
It is.

276
00:13:00,201 --> 00:13:02,866
I'll admit as a rule
i try to avoid being

277
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:05,699
someone's first black friend.
They try too hard.

278
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,766
They start talking
about halle berry,

279
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:10,799
how they voted for obama,
how much they love oprah.

280
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,333
Yeah.
Where are those owners?

281
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,799
Hello. I understand someone
wanted to speak with the o...

282
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,566
you.

283
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:20,367
You own this place?

284
00:13:20,368 --> 00:13:23,233
I didn't know that.
I love it. I love it.

285
00:13:23,234 --> 00:13:26,633
So does my friend frank here.
This is frank.

286
00:13:26,634 --> 00:13:29,233
Ah. Your friend frank.
Yeah.

287
00:13:29,234 --> 00:13:32,900
Yeah. So now i guess we can just
stop all that jibber-jabbering

288
00:13:32,901 --> 00:13:36,466
about who my friends are. Oh,
right, because you thought showing up

289
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:38,966
with a black friend
would stop us from reporting

290
00:13:38,967 --> 00:13:41,333
your racist company
to the real estate board?

291
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:42,833
Pardon me?

292
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:44,100
Whoa, whoa. Hey.

293
00:13:44,101 --> 00:13:46,566
Just because frank here
might be black...

294
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:49,432
i mean, is he? I don't know.
Are you black?

295
00:13:49,433 --> 00:13:51,933
'cause i don't even
see color at all...

296
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:54,733
does not mean that
he is not my actual friend.

297
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:56,300
Okay?

298
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:58,766
Please, frank, tell her.

299
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:01,300
Yes, ma'am!

300
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:04,399
Why, miss samantha here...
she been real good to me.

301
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,666
See what i'm talk... what?
Oh, yes, yes!

302
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:09,666
You see, lots of people,

303
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:12,367
they don't take they doorman
out for no fancy meal.

304
00:14:12,368 --> 00:14:15,933
But miss samantha here... she
don't mind eatin' with the help!

305
00:14:15,934 --> 00:14:18,866
He's your doorman?
No!

306
00:14:18,867 --> 00:14:22,367
He... he's not just my doorman.

307
00:14:22,368 --> 00:14:24,367
Oh, no! No, ma'am!

308
00:14:24,368 --> 00:14:26,933
Why, i also carry her thangs
to and fro.

309
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:31,766
Why, she a real nice lady.

310
00:14:31,767 --> 00:14:37,300
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

311
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:41,399
First of all,
dinner's on me.

312
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,666
I... frank, come on.

313
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:45,666
Frank, please come back!

314
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:49,183
Look, we... we've preordered
the soufflé!

315
00:14:49,218 --> 00:14:52,699
So now frank thinks
that i was using him

316
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,333
just to prove that i had...
a black friend. Which you were.

317
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:57,733
No, i was not!

318
00:14:57,734 --> 00:15:01,333
I only used him after we had
already become friends, okay?

319
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:03,766
And then, yes,
i behaved very badly.

320
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:06,733
You know, i don't think
he's a good influence on me.

321
00:15:06,734 --> 00:15:09,599
I might have to cut him out
of my life. So that's it?

322
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,466
You're not gonna even try to be friends
with him? What am i supposed to do?

323
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:15,300
Quitter.
He doesn't want it.

324
00:15:15,301 --> 00:15:17,966
He hasn't even filed
a restraining order yet.

325
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:20,133
I mean, i waited 20 years
to be your friend.

326
00:15:20,134 --> 00:15:22,699
You put up a fight,
but look where we are w.

327
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,367
Yep, here we are.

328
00:15:25,368 --> 00:15:27,866
I mean, you'd be amazed
at the beautiful friendships

329
00:15:27,867 --> 00:15:30,566
you can force on people.
Wow.

330
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:33,833
Hi! So what are you two
losers doing in three months?

331
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:36,333
Because i'm...
getting married!

332
00:15:36,334 --> 00:15:39,066
What? Oh, my god!
Married to whom?

333
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:42,066
To... to whom.
Tony dane. What do you think?

334
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:45,699
What do i think? I think he's
gay. He's really gay, andrea.

335
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,532
And i think i've waited my
entire life to tell my friends

336
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:50,900
that i'm engaged.
So if you would just put aside

337
00:15:50,901 --> 00:15:56,200
the pesky details for one night
and just get on board, okay?

338
00:15:56,201 --> 00:15:58,733
Yay!
Yay!

339
00:15:58,734 --> 00:16:02,133
Oh, my god. Let me see that.
It is stunning. It's so pretty!

340
00:16:02,134 --> 00:16:04,432
See, tony's entering
a contract year,

341
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:06,532
and they don't want
any bad press.

342
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,699
So they're gonna announce
the engagement,

343
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,566
and then all the designers
are gonna bid to see who's gonna

344
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:14,666
make my dress, and the wedding
photos are already presold

345
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:17,267
to "people" magazine,
and they're paying gwen stefani

346
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:20,766
100 grand to show up and be my
best friend. It's like a fairy tale.

347
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:23,233
I know. I'll get us some
champagne. Oh. Good. Okay.

348
00:16:23,234 --> 00:16:26,900
Se she called me a friend.
That didn't happen overnight.

349
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:29,133
Yeah, well, she's also
marrying a gay dude,

350
00:16:29,134 --> 00:16:31,233
so she might not be
in her right mind.

351
00:16:31,234 --> 00:16:34,300
Three champagnes.
I'm engaged.

352
00:16:34,301 --> 00:16:38,799
What about the other night?

353
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,300
Did you not just hear
what i said? I'm engaged.

354
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:44,233
You felt something
between us,

355
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:46,966
and i know you
weren't that drunk.

356
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:58,833
Little tip... don't ever
underestimate how drunk i am.

357
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:07,367
You don't fool me.

358
00:17:07,368 --> 00:17:09,866
I think i know
the answer to this.

359
00:17:09,867 --> 00:17:12,833
But do you care that i have
a little girl in here

360
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:16,300
who's trying to sleep? She'll be
fine. "Marceo" will take care of her.

361
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:18,399
If you came here
to apologize...

362
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,333
no. For wanting
to be your friend? No.

363
00:17:21,334 --> 00:17:23,300
Am i perfect, frank? No.

364
00:17:23,301 --> 00:17:25,399
But we don't get
to choose our friends.

365
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,733
I mean, do you really think
that i chose dena and andrea?

366
00:17:28,734 --> 00:17:30,833
But there we are.

367
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:33,799
It's late, ms. Newly.
Samantha.

368
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,799
Ms. Newly. We're going back
to the way things were before.

369
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,766
Before dinner?

370
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:41,333
Before your accident,
when you were as mean as a snake

371
00:17:41,334 --> 00:17:44,499
and never gave me a glance.
I didn't have to know you.

372
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,666
I didn't have to care
about you.

373
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:50,133
Aha! You said "care. " I heard
it, frank. You said "care. "

374
00:17:50,134 --> 00:17:52,233
Let's go.
Give me the money.

375
00:17:52,234 --> 00:17:55,333
Oh, this is ridiculous.
Seriously, guy, branch out.

376
00:17:55,334 --> 00:17:58,267
Meet new people.
Oh, damn.

377
00:17:58,268 --> 00:18:00,966
It's the chatty white lady
with no money in her purse

378
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:04,933
is this the man who mugged you? How
can you have $5 and 10 lipsticks?

379
00:18:04,934 --> 00:18:07,633
You lied to the police.

380
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:09,633
Maybe.
But hey, you know what?

381
00:18:09,634 --> 00:18:11,633
If i had told them
who my real mugger was,

382
00:18:11,634 --> 00:18:14,367
we wouldn't be sharing this right
now. Yeah, i'm aware of that.

383
00:18:14,368 --> 00:18:16,367
Shared experiences,
frank. Remember?

384
00:18:16,368 --> 00:18:19,166
Plus you care about me.
You know what?

385
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:22,532
If this guy shot me
right here and now,

386
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:27,066
you would miss me. Hey, oh. Well,
hey, who's got a gun? Not me.

387
00:18:27,067 --> 00:18:29,300
That's... that's armed robbery...
whole different thing.

388
00:18:29,301 --> 00:18:31,333
Just say it, frank.

389
00:18:31,334 --> 00:18:33,499
Tell you what.
I'll close my eyes right now.

390
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,367
You kidnap my friend...

391
00:18:35,368 --> 00:18:38,599
and if anybody asks,
i'll say it was a white guy.

392
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,367
Now why are you talkin'
about kidnappin'?

393
00:18:41,368 --> 00:18:43,966
Excuse me. Hello?

394
00:18:43,967 --> 00:18:47,499
Oh! It's the police.

395
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,900
They found my mugger.

396
00:18:49,901 --> 00:18:52,866
Hey, forget this.
I'd rather just get a job.

397
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:55,766
Um, are you...
are you sure it's... it's him?

398
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,833
'cause my description
was sort of vague...

399
00:18:57,834 --> 00:19:01,300
and useless.

400
00:19:01,301 --> 00:19:04,933
So, ma'am, just tell us
if the man who robbed you

401
00:19:04,934 --> 00:19:17,532
is inside this room.
Mm. Yeah, okay.

402
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:19,666
Wait a minute.

403
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:22,699
They can't... they can't really see me,
right? Why, do you see... do you see the guy?

404
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,799
'cause we caught one of them
breaking into your car

405
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,766
with your keys.

406
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:29,933
Hey, todd, seriously,
i am so sorry. All right?

407
00:19:29,934 --> 00:19:32,933
Look, i-i'll bet you soon
we'll... we'll tell this story,

408
00:19:32,934 --> 00:19:37,466
and we'll just laugh and laugh.
Yeah. What was your favorite part?

409
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,733
Huh?
Mine was the delousing.

410
00:19:39,734 --> 00:19:42,933
Look, i'm sorry, okay?
I- i had to come up with

411
00:19:42,934 --> 00:19:45,933
something really quickly,
and i guess i just described

412
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:48,100
the first guy i thought of.
Really?

413
00:19:48,101 --> 00:19:51,267
Yeah. What?

414
00:19:51,268 --> 00:19:53,432
I was the first guy
you thought of.

415
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:55,900
Oh, don't get all cocky.

416
00:19:55,901 --> 00:19:58,267
Am i always the first guy
you think of...

417
00:19:58,268 --> 00:20:00,066
like in the morning,
when you wake up?

418
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:02,432
This... you know what?
Shut up.

419
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:05,066
It was probably just that
stupid little ratty "mustache. "

420
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:08,133
Well, i'll grow it in some more
if you like it so much.

421
00:20:08,134 --> 00:20:12,166
Yeah, okay, you do that. I'll see you in six
months. You can't even look me in the eye.

422
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:15,300
Should have had them
put you away.

423
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:20,367
Ohh. That was almost
worth getting tasered.

424
00:20:20,368 --> 00:20:23,399
Okay, so anyway,
here's how to cure racism,

425
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,233
and i want credit.

426
00:20:25,234 --> 00:20:27,466
If everyone on earth
just looks into the eyes

427
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:29,799
of every other person,
we'll all be friends,

428
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,000
and there will be no racism.

429
00:20:32,001 --> 00:20:34,666
Of course, the logistics
will be a nightmare

430
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:37,166
and require exceptional
organizational skills.

431
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:39,666
Maybe the chinese can do it.

432
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:42,200
Hey!
Hey.

433
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:45,466
We're friends now, right?
Yes, absolutely!

434
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:48,233
Good.
What?

435
00:20:48,234 --> 00:20:52,766
I need you to cover for me.
My band has a gig tonight. Oh!

436
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:55,367
* the color of
your skin don't matter to me *

437
00:20:55,368 --> 00:20:57,300
can you call me a cab?

438
00:20:57,301 --> 00:21:01,066
* as long as we can live
in harmony *

439
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:04,532
* why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends? *

440
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:06,001
* why can't we... *
