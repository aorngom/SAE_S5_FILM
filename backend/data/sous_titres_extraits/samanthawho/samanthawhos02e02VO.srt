1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,990
i didn't remember ever seeing a rocket launch,

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,950
so i tuned in the other night,but it was dayed.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,630
there it was,all this power and potential,

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,200
just waiting for a sign,an instruction,

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,020
and i shouted,"i understand,rocket. i understand."

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,720
woke my neighbor up.

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,000
to me.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,310
to sam! to sam!

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,190
one year ago today,

10
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,540
i was hit by that car

11
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,110
that knocked me out of that old life

12
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,620
and into my new life,so this is to the car,

13
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:34,140
to old friends,

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,250
who are actually new friends,
which is kind of neat.

15
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,340
- hear,hear! 
- i know. so awful.

16
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,520
- what was?
- the day it happened,remember?

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,410
oh,the day i got amnesia? not well,no.

18
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,110
ugh,when they called me

19
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,030
and told me that you were in a coma,

20
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,100
sam,i cried and i cried,and i prayed to god,

21
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,420
"god,please make me stop crying.

22
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,250
my eyes are gonna get so puffy."

23
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,530
- more,please.
- i had to go to court the next day. oh.

24
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,870
the point is,is that i am alive

25
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,460
and that my life is so much 
better than it was before.

26
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,450
- hear,hear! 
- yeah,how so?

27
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,890
what do you mean,how so?

28
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,870
well,last year you had a job

29
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,440
and you were living with your boyfriend,

30
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,380
and this year you don't have a job

31
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,130
and you're living with your ex-boyfriend.

32
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:24,720

33
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,710

i'm gonna be spending a week at chase's.

35
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,920
we're kind of entering a 
new phase of our relationship.

36
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,270
one week,huh?

37
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,540

more, please.

40
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,820
a whole new start is so exciting.

41
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,140

and now you're graduating.

42
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,000

an acrobat,then we're done.

55
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,910

trying to change everything.

73
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,130
stupid! stupid! stupid!

74
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,360
what's wrong? where're you going?

75
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,600
i don't know. anywhere,my 
parents' house,maybe dena's.

76
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,950
- she's at chapman's all week. i mean,
- come on,stay. it's like old times.

77
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,270
no,it's not supposed to be like old times,okay?

78
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,340
i'm supposed to be new and 
improved and you know what?

79
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,510
you're not helping very much,mister.

80
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,160
well,you weren't complaining last night.

81
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,940
you took advantage of a drunk woman

82
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,250
with a massive head injury. nice work.

83
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,260
look,i tried to wait till you sobered up,

84
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,390
but then you got naked,and
 i lost my train of thought.

85
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,190
maybe andrea's right. you 
know,maybe i haven't changed.

86
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,540
you know,maybe my-my true 
self-just freed up by alcohol-

87
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,730
is my old self sabotaging any 
effort i have to change.

88
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,800
look,and maybe everything in your 
life doesn't need to change.

89
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,210
this feels right.

90
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,450
you know,don't you deserve one
 thing that isn't such hard work?

91
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,570
so what do we do,

92
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,990
give it a try or do i still move out?

93
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,180
i- i just want to know what you want.

94
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,310
i know.

95
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,930
and i will tell you...

96
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,190
when i get back.

97
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,390
back from where?

98
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,250
africa?

99
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,070
africa,yes.

100
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,630
you're not going to africa. 
now eat your eggs.

101
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,870
no,no,i am not eing my eggs 
until africa eats its eggs.

00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,210
and you know what? you guys can help,too,

103
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,850
because i found this 
web site,where for $10,

104
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,750
you can send over a mosquito net

105
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,790
- and help a child from getting malaria. 
- it seems a little high for a net.

106
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,060
do you need $10? is that it?
 just take it out of my purse.

107
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,270
no,i need to go to africa.

108
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,700
no,i can get you a net down 
at spurlock's for 3 bucks.

109
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,780
guys,there is a whole world 
out there that needs your help.

110
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,240
oh,you know,you don't know.

111
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,740
you grew up in the '60s,you know.

112
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,720
you don't know what it's like
 to want to change the world.

113
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,780
if you want to help,i will take you out.

114
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,840
i'll buy you a rubber 
bracelet and-and a red t-shirt.

115
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,580
and then we can spend 
the rest of the day shopping.

116
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,710
no. no. i am not gonna take t the easyth out.

117
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,610
why not? you usually do.

118
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,510
no,i don't. how can you say that?

119
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,190
oh,my god! how horrible!

120
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,300
now we have to walk all the way 
around the block in these heels.

121
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,060
yeah,i don't think so.

122
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,150
officer?

123
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:29,230
officer,my husband-

124
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,380
he's in that building. 
that's where he works.

125

130
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,130
look,dena said that i can go

131
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,970
and do and be anything that i want to now.

132
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:55,160
well,that's because she 
doesn't know you very well.

133
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,540
yeah,well,you know what? 
you don't know me very well.

134
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,650
god. i tught that parents wanted their children

135
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,280
to turn out better than them.

136
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,130
and because i am so much better than you,

137
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,520
you should be thrilled.

138
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:12,040
africa? good for you. you're a good lady.

139
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,240
thank you. that is so nice to hear.

140
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,140
i mean,that is really the first 
positive and encouraging thing-

141
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,420
okay,what is that?

142
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,370
shots.

143
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,620
you got your yellow fever,hepatitis "a,"

144
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,400
hep "c," tetanus,

145
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,340
polio,uh,something,uh,no idea,

146
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,300
big needle,bigger needle and meningitis.

147
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,280
you know,we can hardly keep up.

148
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,580
there's something new every day-

149
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,460
you know,things that you 
don't even want to see.

150
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,800
- look at this. hmm? right there. 
- oh,my god.

151
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,200
oh,wait a minute. that might not be one.

152
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,050
oh,yes,it is. mm-hmm.

153
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,440
and if you get one of those long-ass worms

154
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,530
that hatch inside your leg,
please do not pull it.

155
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,520
all right?

156
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,470
just let it eat its way out of your skin.

157
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,870
and if you have to run 
from a lion,head for a tree,

158
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,190
but be sure you check 
the tree for snakes first.

159
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,560
and always check your shoes for scorpions.

160
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,490
you will be shipping over
 your own blood,right?

161
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,760
it's okay.

162
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,510
uncle chase and i just had a little fight.

163
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,910
it's not your faults.

164
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,480
if he doesn't want anyone 
drinking out of his lucky bowl,

165
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,780
what's it doing in the cabinet,huh?

166
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,340
sam,you're supposed to be in africa.

167
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,180
shh! i am.

168
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,820
???

169
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,240
no,it wasn't just the needles,

170
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,390
because when you get there,they have lions

171
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,940
and-and-and snakes and scorpions.

172
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,720
i mean,have you ever seen a scorpion?

173
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,590
they're li spiders with knives.

174
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,230
and it's hot,and there was 
all these connecting flights.

175
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,710
it was like a whole thing.

176
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,130
let me ask you.

177
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,240
you're not bothered that 
that's not your bowl,right?

178
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,180
or who or what has eaten out of it?

179
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,800
it's yours at the moment,right?

180
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,630
regina,what are you doing?

181
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,370
i set three places again. isn't that silly?

182
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,510
i still can't believe she's gone.

183
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,730
i keep thinking i hear her 
padding down the stairs,

184
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,320
splashing in the tub.

185
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,350
she's been gone a day.

186
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,680
it's so quiet here without her.

187
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,890
there used to be such laughter in this house.

188
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,180
no,there didn't.

189
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,810
i need some air.

190
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,370
the walls are closing in.

191
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,320
i wonder if we're both looking 
at the same star tonight.

192
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,310
hyenas,yeah. they have 
things there that will kill you,

193
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,220
and then they'll kill you 
after you're already dead.

194
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,740
so tell your parents all that. they'll understand.

195
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,020
yeah,they'll understand.

196
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,670
they'll understand that they were right,

197
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,990
that i'm not better than them,

198
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,860
and that's exactly what i do 
not want them to understand.

199
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,500
- stay here. watch the dogs. 
- okay.

200
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,260
- hi.
- hey.

201
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:15,350
did you want to come in? because you can't.

202
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,210
spraying for,uh,silverfish.

203
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,610
i n't want to wa in. i didn't 
even want to come here.

204
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,460
but i guess you had some 
sort of fight with chapman,

205
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,510
which i learned about

206
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,110
in our 8-hour meeting about 
your fight with chapman.

207
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,150
so whatever it is you do 
that makes him happy...

208
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,920
oh,well,i-

209
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,740
uh,don't tell me about it. 
just go and do it.

210
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,760
- mr. cellophane,no!
- oh,my dogs.

211
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,290
sam.

212
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,830
andrea.

213
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,580
oh. hi. what? hi. yeah. huh?

214
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,300
oh. um,i,uh,uh...

215
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,200
okay,you know what? they had needles

216
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,990
and-and snakes and-and bugs with backpacks.

217
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,510
sam,i don't care.

218
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,160
the fact that you decided not to help people-

219
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,350
that's all that matters. come here.

220
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,720
samantha?

221
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,660
- hide me. 
- oh!

222
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,010
hi,mrs. newly.

223
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,470
nice evening.

224
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,340
i- i-i thought i saw samantha.

225
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,930
no. no,just me...

226
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,090
doing my sam impersonation.

227
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:19,260
"hey! look at me! i'm sam!

228
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,250
aah! i don't remember anything."

229
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,730
it's-it's better with the curls.

230
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,000
well,i don't know about 
that hairdo of hers...

231
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,400
i'm about to build houses for poor 
childre cand that's all she cares about?

232
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,000
what are you doing?

233
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,690
what does it look like i'm doing?

234
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,350
i'm gonna stay with dena for two weeks

235
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,950
and then i'm gonna get myself a nice,
big,old lion bite and come back a hero.

236
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:45,930
two weeks?

237
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,800
- why? 
- because that's what i do,andrea.

238
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,410
you know that. i just take the easy way out.

239
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,720
no. i will not let you beat yourself up like this.

240
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,580
now i'm sorry about africa,

241
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,920
- but who has had a harder year than africa? 
- china?

242
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,380
no. you.

243
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,710
you. did africa get hit by a car?

244
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,570
did africa break up with its boyfriend

245
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,310
who still won't move out of its apartment?

246
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,180
it's been a really hard year.

247
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,600
hard? africa should be helping you.

248
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,550
you have two weeks,no one knows where you are.

249
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,420
you need to go somewhere good for you.

250
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:21,060
okay. okay. but i'm not -
 i'm not getting any shots.

251
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,320
oh,you might.

252
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,950
three shots over here.

253
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,070
oh,hello. oh,hello.

254
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,160
i so needed this.

255
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,690
you probably saved more lives by not going.

256
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,550
exactly. exactly.

257
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,610
hey. you know,maybe- 
maybe i should get a t-shirt

258
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,710
so i that get one of those

259
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,180
building-latrines-in-the-
sun- all-day tan lines

260
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,770
for when i get back. what do you think?

261
00:11:58,770 --> 00:11:59,340
yeah?

262
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,360
- hey.
- hey.

263
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,870
- body shot?
- no

264
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,250
no! no phones! 're infrica!

265
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,840
well,we've been gone a whole day.

266
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,690
i just want to see if chase misses me.

267
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,760
you think this is what africa sounds like?

268
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,770
he won't be able to hear 
you over the blenders.

269
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,820
then just let me check
 his old text messages.

270
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,330
if you make me spill 
this drink,you're dead!

271
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,340
- oh,brent. 
- brent.

272
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,930
what are you,uh,what are you doing in miami?

273
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,110
- i just gradust. 
- me,too.

274
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,650
- really? all right. 
- uh-huh. yeah.

275
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,610
yeah,so your parents riding you all the time,like,

276
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,330
"get off the couch. get a job."

277
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,110
that is exactly what they are doing.

278
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,020
yeah,but you just need some space,right?

279
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,960
yeah,just to find out who i am.

280
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,250
yeah,just to cut loose,stop 
thinking,have some sex.

281
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,060
not worry so much every single 
second about the future.

282
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,530
- right,and just have some sex. 
- not happening,brent.

283
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,080
nice to meet you.

284
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,900
sam,um,u i just chejued my messagesme

285
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,930
and the last message from chase-

286
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:01,260
he said,um,"are you okay? i love you very much.

287
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,200
i miss you. i hope you're not dead."

288
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,280
- dead?
- that's not our usual sign-off.

289
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,690
it's usually,"i hope you still like me."

290
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,240
why would you be dead?

291
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,360
all we know at the moment is that sudanese rebels

292
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,800
have sealed off the entire city

293
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,250
with no communicationic or travel i

294
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,210
sam,isn't that where we're supposed to be?

295
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,470
i did it again. i made it worse.

296
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,790
from salamani and the republic of chad,

297
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,350
this is kenneth esther alaric reporting.

298
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,730
that's the name of the town. that's where sam is.

299
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,680
well,i'm sure she's fine.

300
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,280
she's not fine,howard.

301
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:33,890
she's dead.

302
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,480
she is not dead. willou stop that?

303
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,600
they're not reporting any casualties.

304
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,850
i'm taking this very well,i think.

305
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,520
well,i'll be sure to thank 
the pharmaceutical industry.

306
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,420
also because she appeared to me 
in a vision on my walk that night

307
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,270
to tell me she's at peace

308
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,540
and that i've been an excellent mother.

309
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,490
god,i should have just told them the truth,

310
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,130
and now the truth is worse than any lie

311
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,390
i could have even make up.

312
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,220
i just want to call home 
and tell him that i'm okay.

313
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,370
you saw on tv. there's no phone service.

314
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,510
they'll know we're fine when we get home.

315
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,480
we can't go home,andrea. there's no way in or out.

316
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,100
we are stuck in africa.

317
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,050
well,maybe the hotel will give us free drinks,

318
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,450
like they do when you're stuck on the tarmac.

319
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,760
you are not helping.

320
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,700
well,i want to stay. we're having fun.

321
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,510
that's all you wanted,isn't it?

322
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,130
you didn't want to help me. 
you just wanted a vacation.

323
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,260
i wanted a vacation with you,

324
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,780
you know,the way it used to be,you and me.

325
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,350
this whole year,i just-i'm 
watching us just go like this...

326
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,030
and i have been trying to 
get you back to normal.

327
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,920
you were my africa.

328
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,520
you know,i'm so sorry that i turned out

329
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,440
to be a better person than i was.

330
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,480
so am i,because where does that leave me?

331
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,730
i mean,where do i fit in?

332
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,940
i mean,what purpose do i have in your life?

333
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,220
right now... i need you to get us out of here.

334
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,030
right now i need you

335
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:04,640
to dig down deep inside of 
that devious brain of yours

336
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,780
and help come up with a plan.

337
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,500
i guess i can sleep with a guard.

338
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,090
- thank you.
- two,if i had to.

339
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:15,420
okay,good. um,and then i will,
uh,i'll commandeer a humvee.

340
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,160
no,no. you can't drive stick.

341
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,290
see,this is why i need you,
because you know these things.

342
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,650
howard. howard,look at this.

343
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:25,520
a picture of a 12-foot snake 
they caught in africa,

344
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,220
and that big bulge in the 
middle is what it just ate.

345
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,900
now they're saying it's a goat or a dog,

346
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,220
but i think we both know who's in there.

347
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,580
no. no. i- i-it's in the congo,regina.

348
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,480
see,that's nowhere near where sam was.

349
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,500
oh,a mother knows her own child.

350
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,550
hey,everyone.

351
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,730

00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,520

353
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,210

00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,960

357
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,700

358
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,870
wait. let us at least look at you.

359
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,230
yeah,what happened over there?

360
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:07,610
oh,you know,i have suppressed so much of it.

361
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:12,180
- but-but how did you get out? 
- one of us slept with a guard.

362
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,550
- andrea went with you? 
- mm-hmm. and we swam.

363
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,800
yeah,across a river.

364
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,120
river? well,there's no rivers in that part.

365
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:24,170
- excuse me. where you there? 
- will you stop interrogating her?

366
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,990
all that matters is that she's home.

367
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,230
- can i ask her if she saw a monkey?
- no.

368
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,950
i knew you were safe.

369
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,410
i had a vision on my walk,

370
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,580
and you told me not to worry 
and that i was a good mother.

371
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,820
i'm proud of you,kiddou di 
know you had it in you.

372
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,390
yesh,well¡­¡­

373
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,670
oh,and don't forget to call todd.

374
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,410
we phoned him when we saw the news.

375
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,290
i'm sure he's as worried as we were.

376
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,790
great.

377
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,680
hey,frank.

378
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,860
i've been trying to call todd,
but his voice mail's full.

379
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,060
- is he up there? 
- he is not.

380
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,740
he raced out of here this 
morning in a state of agitation,

381
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,610
said he had some shots to 
get before it was too late.

382
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:05,260
what? shots? oh,no.

383
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,840
on,no. frank,todd went to africa to save me.

384
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,710
- but you're not in afri - 
- yeah,you see the needles. then you can judge.

385
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,380
come on!

386
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:16,950
hurry,

387
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:20,140
just gotta try to find some kind
 of itinerary or-or some clue

388
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,380
of where he might have gone. 
here. look through these.

389
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,010
oh,god,i will not forgive myself

390
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,030
if something happens to him and if he gets hurt.

391
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,270
yes,the odds of getting hurt in africa

392
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,910
do go up if you actually go.

393
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,910
all right,i chickened out. all right?

394
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:35,870
africa is a very scary place. oh,todd

395
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,070
you're the only person on the planet

396
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,750
who would go halfway 
around the world to save me,

397
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,300
and i was too self-involved to see it. sam?

398
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:46,170
- sam?
- yeah? oh! to?! oh,thank god!

399
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,910
i didn't go to africa.

400
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:51,100
i lied. i am so sorry,but 
it meant so much to me

401
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,400
that you were gonna go there to rescue me,

402
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,580
and i'm just so glad that
i stopped you before you went.

403
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,140
oh,god.

404
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,660
i wasn't going to africa.

405
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,300
- huh? 
- and that a good-bye for frank.

406
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,780
no,but you-you- you hurried out

407
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,790
'cause you-you had to get 
shots before it was too te.

408
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,140
shots of a playground with my camera.

409
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,020
i'm doing an ad for a shoe company.

410
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,670
you weren't going to africa to save me?

411
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,450
no.

412
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,640
how could you not go to africa to save me?

413
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,890
- because you're not there. 
- yeah,but as far as you know,i am.

414
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,060
i mean,i'm-i'm there right now,

415
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,080
and where are you,you know? you're not there.

416
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,470
neither are you. but i was going to go.

417
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,660
but you didn't go.

418
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,970
yeah,but how would you know that?

419
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:36,350
- becausi know you. 
- no. no,yo not know me.

420
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,780
- you didn't go,did you? 
- yeah,but i was going to go.

421
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,440
but you didn't,and i don't care.

422
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,480
isn't that what you want-a guy 
who sees you for who you are?

423
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,270
no. no,i know who i am.

424
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:50,780
i need someone who thinks that 
i am better than i know that i am.

425
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,660
i- i'm sorry?

426
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,390
oh,damn it. you know...

427
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,730
fine. fine.

428
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,680
i'm just gonna be a better person,all right?

429
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,670
will that get everyone off my ass?

430
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,810
no more taking the easy way out.

431
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,200
i am going to do things the hard way.

432
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,390
- you're going to africa? 
- no,i am kicking you out.

433
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,040
what?

434
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,250
and that is very hard for me to do

435
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,130
but change begins at home. 
but don't hurry or anything.

436
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,000
you can stay here for a week or so.

437
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,330
so do you not wanna date?

438
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,700
todd,no. don't you see what this is about?

439
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,770
i never see what this is about.

440
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,220
okay,so my dentist has this fun 
facts poster in his office,

441
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:33,300
and did you know a rocket has to 
go 25,000 miles an hour to get into orbit?

442
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,460
oh,and the american buffalo
 isn't really a buffalo at all.

443
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,550
it's a bison.

444
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:40,550
anyway,25,000 miles an hour-

445
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:43,520
that's a lot of force keeping 
us right where we are.

446
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,220
so go ahead

447
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,380
and tell your daughter to reach for the stars,

448
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:50,600
just give her a break if she falls a little short.

449
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,380
what do you mean,you didn't go to africa?

450
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,750
look,i'm sorry i lied to you. 
you know,and you're right,

451
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,940
i'm not the person that i want to be.

452
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,220
but you know what? i'm not 
the person that i was either.

453
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,820
and that girl that i used to be-

454
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,400
she wouldn't have even thought
 about going to africa,you know?

455
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,990
so i'm trying to change.

456
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,100
i'm like those rockets,those early rockets,

457
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,460
who-who,you know,they tried 
and sometimes they failed,

458
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,300
but they-they're- they had progress.

459
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,770
samantha,you did go to africa.

460
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,600
what? no.

461
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,780
yes. and you want to know how i know?

462
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,610
because tomorrow morning,
the "action news" is coming here

463
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,930
to interview the mother of 
the girl that went to africa.

464
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,040
???

465
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,310
now if you want dinner,go wash up.

466
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,580
sorry,dad.

467
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,500
are you mad?

468
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,360
mad?

469
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,280
i thought you were gonna tell 
us you were moving back in.

470
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,640
well-played,kid. well-played.

471
