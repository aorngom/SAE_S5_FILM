1
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:07,447
Signposts... they say
very clearly,"you are here"...

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,587
even if "here" isn't
where you want to be.

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:14,327
And especially when, inevitably, the
billionaire you let get away shows up.

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,177
Hello, sam.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,947
Funk. Hi.

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,980
I... oh, it was so weird. I was
just walking by, and I found this arrow.

7
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,847
Uh, so things are going well
for you since you left my company?

8
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,047
Yeah, super-duper, yeah.

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,823
No, I mean, I, uh, get
to work outdoors, you know?

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,727
It's not all cooped up in some limo.

11
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,427
You know, it is so good to see you.

12
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,357
I'm glad I didn't
take the helicopter.

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,227
Probably still could've seen me.

14
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,169
You can probably see me from space.

15
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,117
Well, I'll let you know.

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,637
I'm actually gonna be hitching
a ride on the shuttle in june.

17
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,657
Really?

18
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,887
Oh, eating meals through a tube.

19
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,687
No, thank you.

20
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:56,957
You take care, sam.

21
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,187
And say hi to your
mom for me, all right?

22
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,120
Yeah.

23
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,337
Hey, you're making it
look like you made food.

24
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,137
Who are you apologizing to?

25
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,827
Well, my mother is coming
over here to discuss our business,

26
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,730
and I am going to quit.

27
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,837
Okay, so I'm just gonna go.

28
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,387
She'll understand, right?

29
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,477
I mean, she has to.

30
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,657
I just can't do it anymore.

31
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,887
How did I get here, you know?

32
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,567
I mean, a year ago, I make this big
old deal about leaving chapman & funk

33
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,117
to go do great things with my life,

34
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,997
and now here I am, working
with my mother in this dead-end job,

35
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,657
and my ex-boyfriend's sleeping
on my couch because I need the rent.

36
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,407
I mean, is that not the
lamest thing you've ever heard?

37
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,547
Well, it's up there, but no.

38
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,607
I just have to do something. I
have to do anything.

39
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,107
God. It was so obvious when
I was talking to funk today...

40
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,807
funk?Where'd you see funk?

41
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,837
Oh, on the street corner
that I work.

42
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,207
That didn't come out right.

43
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:04,330
- He's sitting there, in his limo...
- The "limo.

44
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,567
" I bet he looked like a dork.

45
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,880
Yeah, he was pretty
jealous of my big arrow.

46
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,497
- andrea, I hate to bother you...
- then don'T.

47
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,317
that's funny.

48
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,917
The school I'm substitute teaching at
is having a fund-raiser auction...

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,547
you're a teacher?

50
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,707
You knew that.

51
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,217
What happened to that flower shop?

52
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,707
I-I've never had a flower shop.

53
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,077
I guess we'll have
to agree to disagree, then.

54
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,057
Okay, yeah.

55
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:45,817
Um, anyway, I was thinking, maybe
if I donated a ball

56
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,867
autographed by tony dane that maybe
the school would hire me full-time,

57
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,160
and then I'd get that insurance.

58
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,867
Since when am I someone
you can ask for a favor?

59
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,137
Since I heimliched
that olive out of your throat.

60
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,867
Oh, some favor. That was my dinn.

61
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,887
Look, andrea, I-I need that dental.

62
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,247
I keep trying to chew every
bite 20 times like I promised my mom,

63
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,347
but I get to, like,14, and
I just taste blood.

64
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,907
Listen to what I'm dealing with.

65
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,107
According to research
from tony dane's publicist,

66
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,647
people think I'm heartless.

67
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,667
Wow, I don't... I don't know where
they're getting that. I mean, that's...

68
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,487
six out of ten people surveyed
would rather see tony gay than marry me.

69
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,440
If I don't start testing better, they're
gonna call off my wedding.

70
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,027
What if... what if you
get this ball signed for me,

71
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,477
and then people won't think
you're as horrible as you really are.

72
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,427
Better idea.

73
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,667
I'll get that ball
signed for you, but first,

74
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,910
how do you feel about
choking to death?

75
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,397
I don't know. I always
thought I'd be stabbed.

76
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,477
I've always envied
this about you, samantha.

77
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,527
I can never relay hoin
mme unless it's clean.

78
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,547
Yeah.

79
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,480
Sit down, mom.

80
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,957
Pizza bagel?

81
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,587
Oh, Lord. You pretended
to make food.

82
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,847
What have you done?

83
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,117
Okay, mom, now listen.

84
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,607
I love working with you, but
this is just not my dream job, and I...

85
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,767
don't say another word.
I understand.

86
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,157
I don't think you do.

87
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,217
I don't feel horrible yet.

88
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,687
This is not the job for you.

89
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,267
I get that.

90
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,287
It's like when I used to
help you with your math homework,

91
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,907
and finally I just stopped
trying to push that rock up a hill.

92
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,887
And I said,"she's
not gonna need this math.

93
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,087
She's pretty.

94
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,747
" That was a while
ago, but, you know, still...

95
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,717
you know what you need to do?

96
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,287
Yes, something meaningful
with my life.

97
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,997
- Go to vegas.
- What?

98
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,337
Vegas?Why?

99
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,717
I got an invitation
to a motivational seminar.

100
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,257
They promise to focus you on
your dream and help you achieve it.

101
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,867
Plus, I got tickets to bette midler.

102
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:52,047
Yes. Mom, that is exactly
what I need.

103
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,297
Except for betting on the midler thing,
because I don't know anything about gambling,

104
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,420
but vegas... yes, let's do it!

105
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,937
Real estate. You tricked me.

106
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,757
- No, no, no, no.
- Unbelievable.

107
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,237
No, no, no, no, no. Not really, no.

108
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,937
And I j... I'm just trying
to light a fire underneath you.

109
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,307
And they have somereat
motivational seminars here...

110
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,247
I-I mean, one where they actually
light a fire underneath you.

111
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:25,457
Okay, here's $20 for
the poker machines.

112
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,927
That's all you get, okay?

113
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,737
So have fun. See you in a while.

114
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,927
- Where are you going, daddy?
- Oh, I like keno.

115
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,297
You know, you can watch sports, drink
and have an exotic woman

116
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,334
take your money 5 bucks at a time.

117
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,370
It's like the navy again.

118
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:39,877
Come on. We're gonna be late.

119
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,927
No. I'm already late
starting my life, mother.

120
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,197
I am leaving. Okay?

121
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,310
You're gonna miss
out on the free tote bag.

122

miss newly

128
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,927
It's been a while, ma'am.

129
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:36,637
Meaning I've been here before, meaning
you probably want me to leave.

130
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,767
- I'm really sorry.
- Would you like to play?

131
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,927
Um, oh, no, I don't
have any cash on me.

132
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,307
I could get some quarters from
my mom, but she's in the conference...

133
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:47,270
this is in your account
from last time...$5000.

134
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,417
$50--$50,000?

This is... is... this is mi...

00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,577
That's like...

00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,747
I could ch-change that?That's
mine?That's my money?

138
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,527
You mean I could just walk
away fromere with all of that?

139
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,657
Just free and clear?

140
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,657
Yes.

141
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,360
Or you could play some.

142
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,300
New shooter!New
shooter!Place your bets.

143
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,940
- you wanna blow on 'em for good luck?
- Sure.

144
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,187
Maybe a little.

145
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,797
Welcome back, miss newly.

146
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,367
Thanks, bill.

147
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,307
- It's good to be back.
- New shooter.

148
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,697
Good evening.

 Point is six. Odds on the six.

153
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,397
Cover the hard ways. Vodka
martini, dry,2 olives.

Another $500 on the

Come on, baby!Who likes money?

156
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:04,227
How do you lose $100,000?

157
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:08,947
Well, first you have
$50.000, and you lose that.

158
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,147
Then they lend you another
$50,000,and you lose that.

159
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,037
That's $100,000.

160
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,497
See, mom?That math paid off.

161
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,987
You're just li your mother.

162
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,637
She lost her whole $20
while I was in the bathroom.

163
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,377
Oh, yeah, that's gotta hurt, dad.

164
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,057
Why e you smiling?

165
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,817
I'm not smiling.

166
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,477
I'm sad for you that you have to keep working
with your mother to pay off your debt.

167
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,470
That's a smile.

168
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,477
It's the way my mouth is set.

169
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,707
I'm like a dolphin.

170
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,167
Forget it. No, I saw it.

171
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,837
I saw freedom and autonomy. I
had it in my hands.

172
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,577
I know what that feels like.

173
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,577
Daddy, were you gonna leave
me anything when you died?

174
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,397
'Cause, you know, that
day is sneaking up on us.

175
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,477
Oh, can't help you, kiddo.

176
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,977
The support group I went to
after your mom's last bingo bender...

177
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,087
they taught me the worst
thing you can do is be an enabler.

178
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,877
Come on, honey.

179
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,737
- Regina. Regina, no, no.
- J-just one quarter.

180
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,370
I can feel it. This machine
is about to blow. I can feel it!

181
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,627
Here you go.

182
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,387
How am I supposed to
choke on this?It's soft.

183
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,297
You don't have to really
choke. Just pretend.

184
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:15,040
Hey, I did three summers of
theater camp. Don't question my process.

185
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,177
All right.

186
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,540
It's showtime.

187
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,507
Dena!

188
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,297
Dena, are you choking?

189
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,117
Oh, my god!She's choking to death.

190
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,780
It's me, andrea
belladonna. I'll save you.

191
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,107
Come on. Come on, girl.

192
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,647
Don't worry. I'm a scout. I
know exactly what to do.

193
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,667
Kid, it's all right. I got it.

194
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,197
No, come on.
Ieed my lifesaving badge.

195
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,330
Kid, get back!

196
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:48,937
My arm!

197
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,457
He's fine. He's fine.

198
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,450
Andrea belladonna broke my arm!

199
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,440
And scene.

200
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,717
I'm just trying to help you, bill.

201
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,947
I mean, how can you stay
in business if people lose?

202
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,327
You know, that is just not
a model for success, you know?

203
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,777
I really wish I could
help you, miss newly.

204
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,517
Okay, here's the
thing, bi... I have amnesia.

205
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,607
Yeah. Yeah.

206
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,447
You can get in a lot of
trouble for letting me play.

207
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,607
So, uh, why don't you
st give me back my money,

208
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,607
and I won't go to the
department of casino rules,

209
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:19,987
which is very real.

210
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,267
It's good to see
you again, miss newly.

211
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,597
No, bill!Bill. Bill.

212
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,907
Bill, what if I can't pay?

213
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,122
I'm not worried
about that. You'll pay.

214
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,807
Okay, but what if I can't?

215
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,967
- You will.-How?Bill...

216
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,857
they're gonna break
my kneecaps, aren't they?

217
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,337
I need my knees, bill.

218
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,580
I mean, how can I beg
without my knees?Right?

219
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,750
Bill?Bill?

220
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,980
Sam?

221
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,787
Funk.

222
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,400
Be with you in just
one second, okay?

223
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,420
Who makes this carpet again?

224
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,587
I'm gonna be homeless.

225
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,457
God, this is all my mother's fault.

226
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,077
You know, I see homeless
people on the street,

227
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,497
and I wonder how does something
like that happen to these people?

228
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,417
And you know why?Th know my mom.

229
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,657
I know. It... it hurts.

230
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,377
Oh, god. Why didn't I
just go to that conference?

231
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,877
I'd have all
that moneyand a lovely tote.

232
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,997
You would have loved my seminar.

233
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,287
I did this thing where we
lit a fire under someone's chair.

234
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:25,117
Why didn't I just walk
away from that table?

235
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,437
Because you loved it.

236
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,217
What?No, I didn'T. I hated it.

237
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,907
Oh, really?

238
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,647
Come on. The action, the
buzz, money flowing in and out,

239
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,627
people hanging on your every move...

240
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,317
oh, I loved that...

241
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,357
for a moment.

242
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,277
One...

243
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,477
sweet, ecstatic moment of pure joy.

244
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,697
I just... for one
moment, I-I was just...

245
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,647
you were in the game.

246
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,197
Yeah.

247
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,567
Come on. Come back and work for me.

248
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,407
What?No.

249
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,247
No, I'm not going backwards.

250
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,537
Come on. I'll advance you the money.

251
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,222
You can work it off
and leave when you want.

252
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,767
Where's the downside here?

253
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,447
So do you like them?

254
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,547
They make you look very attractive.

255
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,482
Thank you.

256
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,417
You're very generous to accept.

257
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,977
Without recipients
like you... just you...

258
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,847
The winston funk foundation would
fail to keep its tax-exempt status.

259
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,717
They give so much.

260
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,380
It makes me want
to give something back.

261
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,747
No, it's just another street corner.

262
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,747
No, thanks.

263
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,237
All right. At least
let me cover the debt.

264
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,091
I want to do something here to help.

265
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,387
Oh, god. Will you please stop?

266
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,347
- Where are you going?
- I don't know, but you know what?

267
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,997
I'm a smart and creative woman, and I am
sure there are millions of ways for me

268
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,127
to raise that money on my own.

269
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:55,297
You sure you don't want any shoes?
I've got some brand-new jimmy choos, never been worn.

270
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,427
No, no, no, no, no.

271
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,457
I don't come to your work
and sell my undergarments.

272
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,980
I expect the same courtesy of you.

273
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,677
I'll give you a free football phone.

274
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,417
A half-hour more, but that's it.

275
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,157
Ll, course I wanted to do
something nice for young jason here.

276
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,607
I mean, I felt so bad after
he tripped and he broke his arm.

277
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,227
After you pushed me to the ground.

278
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,287
Oh, you.

279
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,597
Well, I mean, what really
matters here, as tondane's fiancée,

280
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:32,037
is that I was able to get a signed,
autographed basketball that i'd like to present to jason now.

281
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,477
Thank you.

282
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,047
You know, the basketball's
great and everything,

283
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,587
but what I really want to ow is...

284
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,710
will you go to my prom with me?

285
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,557
I'd love to.

286
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,217
Sam!Sam, come and look.

287
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,737
We have to get a new tv,'cause
I'm keeping that picture on this one.

288
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,217
That is so not fair.

289
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,626
It's my blood. Who says
I can only sell it twice a week?

290
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,617
Well, if it helps, I can sell
some of my sports memorabilia.

291
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,677
I have a football phone
worth a couple thousand dollars.

292
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,377
That's okay. Don't even look for it.

293
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,257
Please.

294
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,807
Well, what are you gonna do?
I mean, you can't raise 50 grand selling your underwear.

295
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,097
No, at least not without me in it.

296
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:15,777
I don't know at I'm gonna
do, but it cannot involve my mother

297
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:20,327
or being taken care of by
some rich guy who just wants to

298
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:26,277
love me and be with me and
make everything so much easier.

299
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,027
Wait a minute.

300
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,937
Why don't I want that again?

301
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,297
Because that won't make you happy.

302
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,877
Really?'Cause it
sounds like it would.

303
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,597
Sam, you're better than that.

304
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,357
- Maybe not.
- You know this.

305
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:42,097
You go anywhere near this guy,
you might as well stamp "property of winston funk" all over your forehead.

306
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,427
You'll be another acquisition.

307
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,207
Wait. Come here. Come here. Just...

308
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:48,267
- what?
- Look. Look what this guy already owns.

309
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,157
Where on the list
do you think you go?

310
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,767
What are you doing on his web site?

311
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,117
I had some microwave popcorn.

312
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,757
A bunch of kernels didn't
pop, and on the side of the bag,

313
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,337
it said,"a division of funk
worldwide," so I e-mailed a complaint.

314
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,437
Look, whatever. Just look. Dyotyne
electric, labasoche champagne...

315
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,877
parkington brand.

316
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,250
No, no. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What
was that?What was that?

317
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,047
Son of a bitch.

318
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,760
He owns that casino.

319
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,617
Seven out. Shooter loses.

320
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,507
Oh,come on,b m lete
sign for another $30,000.

321
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,417
Cut her off, bill.

322
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,127
Then you'll get cut off.

323
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,937
That looks like a nine from here.

324
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,927
- Nine pays.
- It does, doesn't it?Thank you.

325
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,157
Oh, my god.

326
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,627
He's been playing
me this entire time.

327
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:37,580
He lured us to that conference.

328
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,637
Puts $50,000 into myaccount,which
I couldn'tosbly have won.

329
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:50,137
So then when I lose it all, he
can just show upsaand ve the day.

330
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,477
It's flattering.

331
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,977
I gotta give him that.

332
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:56,137
And now you know you
have to stay away from him.

333
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,205
Why?

334
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:01,467
I mean, if he wants me that badly,
that just gives me leverage to get what i want.

335
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,777
Look, sam, you can't beat him.

336
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,017
You should know this
by now. The house always wins.

337
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,517
Well, then there's only
one thing left to do.

338
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,040
Beat... the house.

339
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,847
Look who's been sitting in my chair.

340
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:26,735
Well, I wanted to see how it
blew smoke up your butt all day long,

341
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,557
but I can't seem to find the button.

342
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,087
Wait a minute. I know that outfit.

343
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,177
If I remember correctly, it
has a tricky zipper.

344
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,517
Well, I decided to dress
up for my job interview today.

345
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,947
- How am I doing?
- I don't know.

346
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,807
Where do you see
yourself in five years?

347
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:44,797
Still beating you over the head
with this stapler if you don't hire me.

348
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,467
So you want your old job back?

349
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,127
I don't want my old job back.

350
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,727
I want to run something...

351
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:54,507
something philanthropic to match
my new, more charitable reputation.

352
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,117
I believe we'll find
a position you like.

353
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,080
We always have.

354
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:11,827
You look beautiful.

355
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,537
Just go.

356
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,907
I don't care how drunk I get. You
do not get to touch my boobs.

357
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,997
Listen, in case we end up together,

358
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,827
I just want to let you know that
tricking u into this wasn't my idea.

359
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,680
Yeah?Then whose idea was it?

360
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,357
Andrea!

361
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,057
Oh, you look great.

362
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,587
Maybe they'll vote you queen.

363
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,257
- You.
- Me.

364
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,607
Jason, you got my ball?

365
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,597
God, you guys look so grown-up!

366
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,770
Makes me want to cry.

367
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,237
Some scout. See if
I ever buy your cookies.

368
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,517
Look, I'm sorry.

369
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,767
She wanted the ball, and
I-i knew there was a chance

370
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,807
you wouldn't go with
me if I asked straight up.

371
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:58,640
You probably prefer the
cool guys like in e marching band.

372
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:04,340
There was a tuba player in the
tenth grade... didn't know I was alive.

373
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:10,267
Your poll numbers
came in low, too, huh?

374
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:15,887
Turns out being a scout isn't exactly
the chick magnet my rabbi said it would be.

375
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,977
What the hell?I look hot. Let's go.

376
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,950
I'm not wearing that. No.

377
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,347
Look, this shouldn't take too long, so
if you want to get a bite afterwards,

378
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:33,597
bloody mary's in bora bora
has an amazing monkfish on friday.

379
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,077
Mm, that sounds good. Let
me just do this first, okay?

380
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,130
Right.

381
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,147
Ladies and gentlemen
of the business press...

382
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,677
- ooh. Save it.
- I am... sensitive.

383
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,047
Oh, okay. I'm sorry.
Sorry about that.

384
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,107
- Do I...
- just...

385
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:01,127
Ladies and gentlemen of the
business press, I am samantha newly,

386
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:04,057
vice president of the
winston funk foundation.

387
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:12,108
Today is a great day,
because although the foundation has fallen short of its giving goals in recent years,

388
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,967
today mr. Funk is pledging...

389
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:23,667
$30 million a year various
charities at my sole discretion.

390
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:28,767
I'm sure mr. Funk and i will make fine
partners because he told me personally

391
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,297
all he wants to do is help.

392
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,607
Now...

393
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:36,077
mr. Funk will answer
all of your questions.

394
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,147
Yeah, I'm gonna take
a rain check on that lunch

395
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,960
'cause I'm gonna be awfully busy.

396
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,197
Mr. Funk, I was just curious...

397
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,707
you know, just because your life
is already pretty far down one road

398
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,817
doesn't mean you
can't take it forward.

399
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,097
Hey, mom!

400
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,047
I'm returning your arrow.

401
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:56,957
I can't have it at my place. I
keep making a wrong turn at the kitchen.

402
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,087
- Guess what?
- what?

403
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:02,307
I sold a house!

404
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,967
Sorry. I didn't hear you.

405
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,517
All I heard was
"chardonnay. What happened?

406
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,287
You know, they told us at that seminar
that we have to find our motivation,

407
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:14,540
and my disappointment in you
was the only motivation I needed,

408
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,400
so as long as you keep letting me down,
there's gonna be no stopping me.

409
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,437
Don't worry if there's
no sign to point the way.

410
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,680
Just trust your own compass
and follow the arrow.

411
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,277
The point is to take
the wheel and drive.

412
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,827
Sometimes the side roads are
where you find the best surprises.

413
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:35,797
Hey.

414
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,417
You know, it's hard to play the
ukulele without looking like a dork,

415
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,940
but you keep at it.

416
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:47,280
So yna g wano out on saturday night?

417
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,830
Yes.

418
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,697
It's a game, right?

419
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,677
I mean, you can't
win if you don't play.

420
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,680
