1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,890
for the first time since I can remember,which,to be fair,is only,like,two years now,

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,650
I have a job I love-- giving mon to charities.

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,970
But there's only so much money,so giving to one charity means turning down another

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,940
-- meaning someone always gets hurt.

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:17,840
Damn it!

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,510
You all right?

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,690
Yes.

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,790
It hurts so much to say no to so many people.

9
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,200
Especially when there's so much to say yes to right here.

10
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,300
Hey,you know what?I'm kind of busy right n

11
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,210
I'm trying to establish a relationship with the senate finance committee that oversees nonprofits.

12
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,960
I think you deserve a glass of wine.

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,320
I mean,look at me.I have the senate switchboard on my speed dial.

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,300
There are hookers who don't even have that.

15
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,700
I got this at auction.

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,190
It's a 1986 chateau latoque chamonelle.

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,660
You're wasting it.I have one more call,and then I have a date.

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,400
Come on.

19
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,520
It's after 10:00 P.M.

20
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,790
It's technically not a date.

21
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:48,690
It's not 10:00.

22
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,410
It's only--oh,my god!Oh,my god!

23
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:51,830
Todd's gonna kill me!

24
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,690
Why didn't he call?

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,110
14 missed calls.

26
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,360
After the sixth one,he should have called the cops.

27
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,830
You're back together with that todd?

28
00:00:58,970 --> 00:00:59,630
No,no,no.

29
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,790
It's just a first date-- well,since we broke up...

30
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:03,580
the second time.

31
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,340
So I guess it's a first first de after the second breakup.

32
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:07,840
I-I gotta go.

33
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,220
Um,you realize this is a $4,000 bottle of wine?

34
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,030
I mean,that is-- that is just-- really?Thank you!

35
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,060
That'll smooth things over,huh?

36
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,420
Todd?

37
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,230
oh,todd,I am so,so sorry.

38
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,190
I-I completely lost track of time.

39
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,450
I got caught up in work.

40
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,060
Then why do you have wine on your breath?

41
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,480
Oh,no.I don't have wine on my breath.

42
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,730
I have wine on my coat.

43
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,260
Yeah,the cab driver kept stopping really fast.

44
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,520
His backseat is now worth $4,000.

45
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:36,330
Okay,well,um,I'm trying to watch this,so...

46
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,880
oh,come on.Please don't be mad.

47
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,180
Look,I really want to go out with you.

48
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,110
Just give me another chance,all right?

49
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,860
I'll let you suck my coat.

50
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,090
Really,really,I'm not mad.

51
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,510
at--at the fourth call,I was mad.

52
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,130
By the tenth,I remembered how awful it was being with you before.

53
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:57,350
Okay,I'm not a student of human emotions,but that kind of sounds like someone who's mad.

54
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,240
No.No,I'm glad it happened now before I got all involved again.

55
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:04,150
It's like,you know,I-I love kiwis,but they give me a rash.

56
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,070
And if i don't eat them for a while,i forget I'm allergic.

57
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,750
Then I take a bite,and there it is again.

58
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,220
So thank you for the rash.

59
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,390
you know what?I think that you are overreactin to an isolated incident,and...

60
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:20,840
Where were you?

61
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,320
I called you,like,14 times.

62
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,150
Oh,I had a crazy day at work.

63
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,000
What are you doing home?

64
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,130
I thought you were going to a concert.

65
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,040
No,we were supposeto go to a concert for your birthday,which is today.

66
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,650
I should have listened to your whole message.

67
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,060
Well,come on,let's go.

68
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,650
Sam,it's after midnight.

69
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,910
Then it's no longer my birthdaY.

70
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,710
I should celebrate that.

71
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,810
You can come if you want to.

72
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,260
No?All right.

73
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,970
Yes,I screwed up.

74
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,030
But now I have this job that's-- that's really important to me,

75
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,850
and I just need to learn how to balance that with equally important things to me in my life.

76
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,920
If you were a charity,they'd dovetail.

77
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:56,840
But you're not.

78
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,340
You're doing really well.

79
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,730
Thank you for making up the couch todaY.

80
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:00,990
Fine,fine.

81
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,100
One more chance.

82
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,160
Thank you.

83
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,110
Tomorrow night?

84
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,640
I can'T.I can do wednesday.

85
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,540
I can'T.I have a dinner that I've already cancelled three times.

86
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,940
Otherwise I would be there with bells on.

87
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,880
"Belzon.

88
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,420
" That sounds like an alien.

89
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,350
"here.I'm here with belzon.

90
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,580
Don't be afraid.

91
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,750
Belzon only eats glass."

92
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,960
Well,you can't say we didn't try.

93
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,150
all right.

94
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:24,980
All right.

95
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,260
I will cancel.

96
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,250
That village hasn't had water for a year.

97
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,440
What's one more day,right?

98
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,450
All right.

99
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,150
You're dating todd again?

100
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,520
I'm so excited for you.

101
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,970
Well,we're not dating yet.

102
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,280
We're just going on a date.

103
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:48,560
But if it goes well,you know,it could lead to another and another and another.

104
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,880
I can see us riding horses.

105
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,020
No!

106
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,290
Why are you going to go down this path again?

107
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,820
Especially when you have this handsome,rich man who wants you?

108
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,930
You can marry him,and we could be in the bajillionaire wives club together.

109
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,280
Ooh,I was the president of the astronomy club.

110
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:10,030
Yeah,oh,word of advice-- get your dues early,or you will end up with a very expensive telescope.

111
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,010
Yeah.

112
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,350
Anyway,I'm not going down that path again,okay?

113
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,960
Todd and I are at very different places in our-- can you please get that camera out of my face?

114
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,010
Yeah,enough about you anyway.

115
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,350
It's my episode of "superstar weddings.

116
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,450
" I can't believe I'm on my favorite sh

117
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,350
I mean,these are the same people that do "superstar divorces.

118
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:35,390
" In fact,I even have my quote ready for that show if--if need be,god forbid.

119
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,190
you're so funny.My funny friends.

120
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,750
But you know what's not a joke?

121
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:45,250
The great taste of bauman's original hard lemonade.

122
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,040
Sam,what is your mom doing here?

123
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:48,860
What?

124
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:49,890
Your mom?Your mom?

125
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,430
She is not supposed to be on camera.

126
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,650
your backstory is your mother is dead.

127
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,960
What are you doing here?

128
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,880
Well,this is the last place your father will think to look for me.

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,560
You know,when he suddenly retired,I thought that we would travel,see the world,you know?

130
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,660
See things we've never seen before.

131
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,420
All he wants to do is have sex.

132
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,190
I mean,it's fun,but certainly nothing I haven't seen before.

133
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,950
Oh,the one night you want the music to be loud,and you hear every word.

134
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,560
I mean,right now he thinks I'm at the refrigerator getting whipped cream,

135
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:22,040
but I saw my car keys on the table,and I-I just ran.

136
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,980
Well,obviously,you two are not on the same page about his retirement.

137
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,940
So why don't you,like,make a list of all the things that you want to do now,

138
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,050
compare 'em,and then decide what you want to do first?

139
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,130
Yeah,well,he's made a list,all right.

140
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,540
I think he's been on the internet.

141
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,480
Could you turn that up,please?

142
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,920
yeah,just crank it.

143
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,250
Sorry.I gotta finish up.

144
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,250
Big date.

145
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,650
Really?Lucky you.

146
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,610
Is she pretty?

147
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,390
Gorgeous.

148
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,990
I mean,she'd have to be,since she's kind of a flake.

149
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,960
Well,perhaps that makes her elusive and intriguing.

150
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,760
you'd think,but no.

151
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:58,130
Well,I happen to have a date myself.

152
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,660
You should probably sleep with him.

153
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,790
I heard guys like that.

154
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,250
Oh,I don't kn

155
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,760
I think this one might be gay.

156
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,950
You should see what he does with his hair.

157
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,560
hello?

158
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,600
Samantha?

159
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,770
Did I catch you at a bad time?

160
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:14,770
Uh,yes.

161
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,270
What's up?

162
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,520
I'm supposed to meet with senator rudd at the harrison club tonight,

163
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:24,900
but I was called away to new york for a meeting,and I was hoping you would entertain him.

164
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,810
Um,nope,I can'T.

165
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:27,760
I have plans.

166
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:28,930
Sure.Oh,okay.

167
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,460
Just that senator rudd co-chairs the senate finance committee,

168
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,110
and you mentioned something about wanting the foundation to be taken seriously,something like--

169
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,220
doesn't matter.Okay,have a good time.

170
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,430
No,no,no.

171
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,340
wait.

172
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,490
Damn it!

173
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,900
Smart move,sam.

174
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,450
And oh,uh,if he puts his hand on your knee,he's just trying to stand up.

175
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,970
You ready to go?

176
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,360
Hey,you know what I was thinking?

177
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:55,370
Why don't I go out for a couple of hours and bring us back some takeout?

178
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,080
What?

179
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,650
No?Okay.Let's go.

183
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,620
You know,todd,I was thinking,why don't we just shake things up a little bit,you know?

184
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,860
Maybe go someplace that we would never,ever go to in a million years.

185
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,800
But we have reservations at stingray.

186
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,400
They're,like,impossible to get.

187
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,440
No,I was thinking about this place that I've been really,really wanting to try-- the,um,harrison club.

188
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,410
that supper club where the old people eat?

189
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,860
And they stop serving at,like,8:30 when the salisbury steak runs out?

190
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,370
Yeah!How cool is that?

191
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,490
I mean,it's,you know,it's,like,so unhip that it's hip.

192
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,930
I mean,really,if it was any worse,it would be impossible to get in.

193
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,820
So come on!

194
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,180
Let's go get us some supper.

195
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,390
come on.

196
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,030
Okay.

197
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,380
I finished my list.

198
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,440
Oh,good,good.This is fun,huh?

199
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:56,990
Okay,the first thing I want to do is see venice,italy,before it sinks into the ocean,now that you're retired.

200
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,170
What do you want to see?

201
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,490
"The x-files.

202
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,100
" The tv show?

203
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,100
Yeah.I ordered the whole thing on dvd.

204
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,540
Okay.

205
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,610
anything else you'd like to see?

206
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,720
Africa?

207
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,680
Russia?

208
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,920
"Lonesome dove.

209
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,170
" Never finished it.

210
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:20,010
Anything else that might possibly not involve you sitting around all day on your ass?

211
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,550
howard!

212
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,490
We talked about this.

213
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,670
I want to see the world,maybe get a second home,

214
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:39,400
enjoy the freedom to do whatever we want and go wherever we want whenever we want.

215
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,370
This is our time,honey.

216
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,420
Let's make the most of it.

217
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,340
I'm sorry,hon.I...

218
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,710
I was only thinking about myself.

219
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,340
Thank you.

220
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,120
Appreciate that.

221
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,510
Want to take a shower?

222
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,830
lovely.

223
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,480
If you want to buy one,you can pick it up on your way out.

224
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,320
Thank you.

225
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,390
Great.

226
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,360
Isn't this cool?

227
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,290
Cool,yes.

228
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,780
Like a morgue.

229
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,060
Senator?

230
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,590
Senator?

231
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,850
Where's my soup?

232
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,400
I'm sorry.It's coming.

233
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,240
Why are you calling everyone senator?

234
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,840
Oh,um,you know,it's a term of respect.

235
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,650
Sort of like,"evening,captain.

236
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,870
Hello,senator." It's very classy.

237
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,810
Senator?

238
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:31,520
No.

239
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,320
Okay.Okay,sam,what's going on?

240
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,190
Tell me the truth and I won't be upset.

241
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,910
Well,no,I will be,but not as upset as if I find out that you're lying.

242
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:39,960
Or probably the same.

243
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,490
Actually,I don't see this going well for you either way.

244
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,910
Okay.

245
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,820
Funk called before we left,and he said I had to come here and meet this guy.

246
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,340
Wait.So this is work?

247
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,490
No!

248
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,240
You and I,we're still on a date.

249
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,960
But if a little work gets done in the process,then guess who wins?

250
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,920
Everybody.

251
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,220
Except me.

252
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,740
Yeah,well,maybe not you.

253
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,340
Look,what was i supposed to do?

254
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,560
Funk couldn't make it.

255
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,100
Oh,good.You' here.

256
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,520
Funk,what are you doing here?

257
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,710
You're supposed to be in new york.

258
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:13,020
Oh,they canceled that meeting,which allows me to be here with you.

259
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,820
Can you show us to our table,please?

260
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,370
Funk,meet todd.

261
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,520
Oh,hello.

262
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,640
You're balder in person.

263
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:29,020
You know,it's hard to balance dating and work,so,dating,you stay here.

264
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,930
Work,you come with me,okay?

265
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,160
May I just say that you look fantastic tonight?

266
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,500
I always look more beautiful standing next to a liar.

267
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,410
You never had any plans in new york.

268
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,060
You just got me here so you could be alone with me.

269
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,160
You know what?I'm on a date with todd.

270
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,630
So you can go entertain the senator by yourself

271
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,020
- if there even is a senator.
-there is a senator.

272
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,700
-But there's no todd,though.
-What?

273
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,470
Thank god.I thought you left without me.

274
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,840
oh,gosh.

275
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,490
What,you two don't see enough of each other all day?

276
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,450
I didn't know he was gonna show up.

277
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,960
How can you work side by sid with a guy who wants to sleep with you?

278
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,370
That's his problem.

279
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,980
I mean,what do you want me to do--quit?

280
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,290
So you admit he wants to sleep with you?

281
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,380
Jeez!

282
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,570
For a first date,you are awfully possessive.

283
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,850
Not really a problem,since I'm pretty sure there won't be a second date.

284
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,020
I'm not attracted to my boss,todd.

285
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,390
What if he wasn't your boss?

286
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,760
I don't kn

287
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:31,380
I mean,that's like asking me if--if I would be attracted to my father if he wasn't my father.

288
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,610
It's impossible to kn

289
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,820
It's impossible to know if you'd be attracted to your father?

290
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,990
Have you seen pictures of him when he was younger?

291
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,830
He is a very dashing man.

292
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,700
You--you know what?You know what?

293
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,570
Just forget it.

294
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:42,860
Your cab's here.

295
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,450
-You take it.
-No,no.Just take it.

296
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,420
I'll get the next one.

297
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,170
Oh,god.This is stupid.

298
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,600
We're going to the same plE.It's a waste of gas and money.

299
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:49,290
Fine.

300
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,170
Get in.

301
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,070
But we're not talking.

302
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,300
Oh,jeez.You think?

303
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,600
I'm sitting up front.

304
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,450
Sit on the hood for all I care.

305
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:57,980
where to?

306
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,550
it smells weird up there.

307
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,340
I can taste it in my mouth.

308
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,090
what are you doing?

309
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,650
When I come home from a crappy date,I like to drink a beer and go to bed.

310
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:45,720
Well,when I come home from a really crappy date,I like to sion the couch and watch tv.

311
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:50,850
Too bad,because the couch you like to sit on happens to be the bed I like to sleep on.

312
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,600
can I ask you a question...

313
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,730
as my roommate?

314
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,920
Was it really that bad that I took my date to a work function?

315
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:07,940
Yes.

316
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,670
You're not todd.You're my roommate.

317
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,870
Oh,as your roommate?Yeah.

318
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,080
Yes.

319
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,250
I need a different roommate.

320
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,800
Now let me ask you one.

321
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,880
I went out with this crazy chick--

322
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,640
Roommate.

323
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:26,190
I may have overreacted to her boss-- who's also her former lover-- 

324
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:32,690
who showed up on our date and made a jealous scene in front of an old folks' home.

325
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,000
bro,you acted like a little bitch.

326
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,800
Did you cry?

327
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,400
Shut up.

328
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,950
Think if I call her,she'll go out with me again?

329
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,550
Bro,no,you don't call her.

330
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,510
You let her call you.

331
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:57,760
It sounds like she may have had a little something to do with what happened.

332
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,530
she's probably out with some other guy.

333
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,950
You'll do.

334
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,640
Hold it.

335
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:30,580
Thanks.

336
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:37,400
Winston funk-- entrepreneur,jet-setter and part of my inner circle of close friends.

337
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,230
Andrea.

338
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,470
You know my name?

339
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,610
Of course you do,'cause you're my close friend.

340
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,330
Okay,guys,do you think we can just drop the cameras?

341
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:51,380
-Just for-- just for a few floors.
-yes!Yeah,if you-- turn 'em off.

342
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,240
You're a friend of samantha's aren't you?

343
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,030
Uh-huh,as well as,um,sports figures and entertainers.

344
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,030
Great girl.Just...

345
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:09,150
yeah,shmentioned something about,I don't know,seeing her ex-boyfriend again.

346
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,710
I mean,that's good,right?

347
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,110
You sound concerned.

348
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,180
Well,who wouldn't be?

349
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,540
I mean,the boy sleeps where people sit.

350
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,930
Interesting.

351
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,210
He's,like,a starving artist or something like that?

352
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,040
Yeah.

353
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,120
Photographer.

354
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,050
Nothing special.

355
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,840
Local stuff,you know,like magazines and stuff.

356
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,900
Well,maybe he'll get his big break.

357
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,560
see you.

358
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,690
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

359
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:41,720
Great moment,a delicious moment-- almost as delicious as hickory jack's smoked bacon.

360
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,260
Put some bacon in your bag.

361
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,050
Regina!

362
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,280
Guess what?

363
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,700
Don't tell me-- you finished watching the second season of "alf.

364
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,520
" Uh,no.I-I listened to you,regina,and you were right.

365
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,410
We need to travel and have a-a second home,too,

366
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:05,170
and--and go anywhere we want to go anytime we want to go anywhere we want to go,anytime--where--places.

367
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,450
really?

368
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,780
You mean that?

369
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,690
The solution was so easy.

370
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,710
Look!

371
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:12,910
Look!

372
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:19,010
I call it "the regina.

373
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,990
" I named her after you.

374
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,110
sam?Yeah?

375
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,710
I'm in the dining room.

376
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,940
well,hello.

377
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,130
What's,uh,going on here?

378
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,220
Well,tonight was supposed to be our second date,

379
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:48,760
and I realized what went wrong with the first one.

380
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,100
We were out.

381
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:54,300
so just thought we would stay home in a controlled environment,

382
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,150
where no work can interrupt us.

383
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,720
I told frank no visitors.

384
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,420
I unplugged the computer,and I mailed myself my cell phone,

385
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:04,620
so that should be gone for a couple of days.

386
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,960
So now it's just you and me,a romantic dinner.

387
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,690
I think you know what that means.

388
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:12,390
SaM...

389
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:17,900
I got an unbelievable job offer to be the photo editor of a magazine.

390
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,420
It's in london.

391
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,920
They want me to leave tomorr

392
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,420
no,silly.

393
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,440
It means we're gonna have sex...

394
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,680
that's what.

395
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,260
London?

396
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,530
I don't understand.

397
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,750
Wait.Y-you don't understand london,or-- 

398
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,860
no,I understand london,todd.

399
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,210
Well--well,I don't kn.With the amnesia-- 

400
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,560
I mean,you thought harry potter was the 33rd president.

401
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:46,510
I'm just saying that,you know,as your roommate,I would have liked to have had a little bit more notice.

402
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,720
Well,I haven't taken the job yet.

403
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,870
I-I thought I'd discuss it with you first.

404
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,080
Me?

405
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,450
Okay.

406
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:55,910
I...

407
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,090
it's a--it's a-- it's a great opportunity.

408
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,110
So you think I should take it?

409
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:03,830
I mean,I-I can't answer that.

410
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,040
I mean,it's not like I can ask you to stay,right?

411
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,750
Yeah,and I can't ask you to move,right?

412
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:10,610
It's not like you and I are-- 

413
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,140
well,no.We had one date.

414
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:12,890
I kn.I kn

415
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,720
Who moves with a guy to london after one date?

416
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,600
A crazy lady.

417
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:18,130
Yeah,it would have to be one hell of a date.

418
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,800
Yeah.Just...yeah.

419
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,200
This is...yeah.This is...

420
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,310
this is your big chance.

421
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:28,830
Yeah.

422
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:33,250
And you finally got the job you always wanted.

423
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,280
Yeah.

424
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,060
And we can still talk all the time.We have phones.

425
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,880
It's not like I'm on the moon or something.

426
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,420
Oh,yeah.I-- 

427
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,990
even if you were on the moon,I'm sure we could still talk,you know?

428
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,030
The phones these day anD...

429
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,640
the roaming.

430
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,340
so you're happy for me?

431
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,300
I've never been happier.

432
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,060
Yay!

433
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,280
Todd?

434
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,700
todd?

435
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,880
Hey,dad,what's going on?

436
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,550
What do you mean,you're here?

437
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,310
what the hell is this?

438
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,610
Funny,I said exactly the same thing.

439
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,360
Remember I said that,howard?

440
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,260
You and I said exactly the same thing.

441
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:58,530
Yeah,we're gonna follow the dream,sammy-- see the world just like your mother wanted.

442
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,770
Just remember-- if the R.V.'S rockin',don't come a-knockin'.

443
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,460
Knock,samantha.

444
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,680
Knock all you want!

445
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,790
Late again?

446
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,510
You are putting us all to shame.

447
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,760
Oh,no.I finished a long time ago.

448
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,350
You know,once you start watching videos of cats doing funny things,you really can't stop.

449
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,420
look at that.

450
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,160
That cat's riding a dog.

451
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,630
It's like...

452
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:29,820
it's friday night.

453
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,000
Why aren't you out with that todd?

454
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,780
He moved to london for a job.

455
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,910
London?Really?

456
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,150
I'm really sorry to hear about that.

457
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,670
Sure you are.

458
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,340
Listen,I dusted off a 1970-- I don't care.

459
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,020
Just pour.

460
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,810
I read somewhere that when god closes a door,he opens a wind

461
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,410
just not too wide,I hope.

462
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,910
All kinds of things could get in.
