1
00:00:00,495 --> 00:00:01,741
Previously on Nip/Tuck...

2
00:00:01,822 --> 00:00:05,239
Every time you lipo a big black ass or shave the bump off of a jewish nose,

3
00:00:05,316 --> 00:00:07,667
you make that person more viable in a white world.

4
00:00:07,735 --> 00:00:09,665
Why would you want somebody like that in your life, Matt?

5
00:00:09,734 --> 00:00:10,890
She's a racist.

6
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:14,104
I'm so afraid I'm making a mistake, Gina.

7
00:00:14,434 --> 00:00:16,331
I'm giving up everything for him.

8
00:00:34,155 --> 00:00:38,191
This was spray painted on the locker of a jewish girl at Coral Gables Prep.

9
00:00:38,752 --> 00:00:41,137
Several blocks away, "go home, lemonheads"

10
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:44,132
was scrawled on an asian-american couple's front door.

11
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,562
That's terrible, detective, but why come to us?

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,443
Well, both the teenager and the asian husband were patients of yours.

13
00:00:52,723 --> 00:00:54,557
So you haven't had any files go missing?

14
00:00:54,634 --> 00:00:58,460
No strange behavior from your employees or patients?

15
00:00:58,870 --> 00:00:59,929
No...

16
00:01:00,462 --> 00:01:04,886
but we'll double check the files and keep an eye out for anything unusual.

17
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,350
So I'll get back to you guys in a few days.

18
00:01:10,429 --> 00:01:12,284
If you think of anything before then,

19
00:01:12,921 --> 00:01:14,174
please give me a call.

20
00:01:14,276 --> 00:01:15,235
Ok.

21
00:01:19,059 --> 00:01:19,980
Detective.

22
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:25,274
How long does someone have to be gone before you can file a missing persons report?

23
00:01:25,337 --> 00:01:26,813
She's not missing, Sean.

24
00:01:27,982 --> 00:01:30,217
Do you have any reason to suspect foul play?

25
00:01:30,302 --> 00:01:33,702
No. I only suspect that my fiancee came to her senses.

26
00:01:35,558 --> 00:01:38,248
I didn't know that sort of thing happened to a guy like you.

27
00:01:50,563 --> 00:01:52,551
Christian, I know it's only been a few days,

28
00:01:52,634 --> 00:01:55,370
but don't you think you have to examine every possible scenario?

29
00:01:55,444 --> 00:01:57,208
- It isn't like--
- Kimber's gone...

30
00:01:57,929 --> 00:01:59,618
and I'm moving on, Sean.

31
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:04,437
I'm not meant to be married to her or anybody else.

32
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:07,011
Look at me. I'm a wildly successful plastic surgeon

33
00:02:07,104 --> 00:02:11,801
with great hair, pearl-white teeth, and a 33-inch waist.

34
00:02:11,901 --> 00:02:13,561
I'm a goddamn superhero.

35
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:18,028
And I'm gonna put that cape back on, fly back into every singles bar in town and...

36
00:02:18,822 --> 00:02:20,291
bang myself silly.

37
00:02:24,942 --> 00:02:27,298
I've got a consult waiting in the office.

38
00:03:24,428 --> 00:03:28,468
Tell me what you don't like about yourself, miss... Mays.

39
00:03:28,754 --> 00:03:32,227
I don't like that I look like a clydesdale.

40
00:03:32,457 --> 00:03:34,836
My face belongs in a feedbag, and these hips

41
00:03:34,925 --> 00:03:37,497
and legs should be pulling the budweiser beer wagon.

42
00:03:39,113 --> 00:03:43,786
Um, this is where your wonderful bedside manner should kick in.

43
00:03:43,864 --> 00:03:48,704
You should say, "No, Abby, I think you're an attractive lady."

44
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,482
Or at least a handsome gal?

45
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:53,871
That's what my dad used to call the ugly women--handsome.

46
00:03:55,089 --> 00:04:00,629
Why don't you be a little more specific about exactly what changes you're looking for.

47
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:04,950
I just know I want to be beautiful

48
00:04:05,034 --> 00:04:08,254
so I can be loved by someone like you.

49
00:04:09,806 --> 00:04:13,861
Ok, not you exactly. I know you're unattainable.

50
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:16,026
I know that. I saw you in Beach Drive magazine.

51
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:19,608
I know you were named one of Miami's 50 most eligible bachelors.

52
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:23,422
But you're off the market, right? You're... engaged?

53
00:04:25,256 --> 00:04:26,700
Not anymore.

54
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,103
Look, if it's a boyfriend you're looking for,

55
00:04:33,175 --> 00:04:36,582
why don't you save your money and try online dating or personal ads?

56
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:39,421
I'm sure there's somebody out there who's perfect for you.

57
00:04:39,508 --> 00:04:41,753
I have done them all already,

58
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:46,300
but nothing's clicked. On most of the dates the guy usually just turns

59
00:04:46,334 --> 00:04:49,111
and walks out of the restaurant once he sees Flabby Abby

60
00:04:49,185 --> 00:04:52,146
Or they're just too hideous, and I walk out on them.

61
00:04:52,473 --> 00:04:56,523
You know, the ugly ones are usually the best lovers.

62
00:04:56,605 --> 00:04:59,410
Real... givers...

63
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,928
to make up for their shortcomings.

64
00:05:03,378 --> 00:05:08,161
Just because I am ugly doesn't mean I'm attracted to ugly, Dr. Troy.

65
00:05:08,248 --> 00:05:12,585
I get all the magazines. I watch MTV. I'm as affected by the media as anyone else.

66
00:05:12,658 --> 00:05:15,295
Well, sweetheart, you're never gonna look like Angelina,

67
00:05:15,363 --> 00:05:17,541
and you're never gonna sleep with Brad.

68
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:19,409
That's just the way it is.

69
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:20,725
Life sucks for you.

70
00:05:20,797 --> 00:05:22,300
You don't think I should try plastic surgery?

71
00:05:22,392 --> 00:05:25,142
You'll need multiple surgeries, and none of them are cheap.

72
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:29,483
I realize that. I want to do whatever it takes to be beautiful.

73
00:05:30,648 --> 00:05:31,557
Fine.

74
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:35,253
Give me your lipstick and take off your clothes.

75
00:05:36,739 --> 00:05:38,149
Is that really necessary?

76
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,739
Your first step towards a life of beauty

77
00:05:40,844 --> 00:05:45,246
is taking a long, cold look at reality.

78
00:05:45,331 --> 00:05:47,515
So yeah, I think it's necessary.

79
00:05:48,232 --> 00:05:49,273
Strip.

80
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:26,624
Beauty is symmetry, and you don't have any.

81
00:06:29,692 --> 00:06:33,940
First I have to get rid of all this nasty cottage cheese.

82
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:41,324
And here you need some laser hair removal to keep this forest under control.

83
00:06:42,828 --> 00:06:46,699
These mud flaps will need to be lopped off.

84
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:50,564
Have you ever picked up anything heavier than a carton of Haagen Dazs?

85
00:06:50,648 --> 00:06:53,258
Um, well, I don't go to a gym or anything.

86
00:06:53,351 --> 00:06:54,552
Obviously.

87
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,353
Your beer belly will need extensive abdominal lipo.

88
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,513
And you could insulate your house with the amount of fat

89
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:09,882
I'm gonna suck out of your hips and your ass.

90
00:07:16,842 --> 00:07:18,179
Is something wrong?

91
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:24,663
I ran out of lipstick.

92
00:07:34,885 --> 00:07:37,077
What about my face, Dr. Troy?

93
00:07:38,611 --> 00:07:40,166
It's a lost cause.

94
00:07:40,756 --> 00:07:47,151
But if I sculpt your body with tumescent lipo, it might be salvageable.

95
00:07:47,262 --> 00:07:48,400
"Salvageable?"

96
00:07:48,498 --> 00:07:51,611
Do-able. Screwable. Ready to be ridden bareback.

97
00:07:53,377 --> 00:07:54,885
Now put your clothes back on.

98
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:56,940
You look like a road map to hell.

99
00:08:04,929 --> 00:08:07,360
After we remove the embedded metals,

100
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,058
we can even out the skin surface with a light microdermabrasion.

101
00:08:11,174 --> 00:08:13,717
Excuse me, Dr. Costa. I'll handle it from here.

102
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,594
I  thought I'd go ahead and get started. I didn't want to waste this soldier's time.

103
00:08:18,674 --> 00:08:21,902
We'll only be wasting his time if we examine him twice.

104
00:08:29,858 --> 00:08:31,988
- Isn't he a doctor?
- Yes, he is,

105
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:36,986
but you deserve to be examined by a partner, instead of just one of our associate doctors.

106
00:08:37,176 --> 00:08:38,302
Sounds great.

107
00:08:39,378 --> 00:08:44,038
Can you tell me how you got your shrapnel scars, corporal Brandt?

108
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:49,519
I  ran a regular supply convoy on route Irish.

109
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,599
It's the only road between Central Baghdad and the airport.

110
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:54,151
They call it the most dangerous road on earth

111
00:08:54,222 --> 00:08:57,056
'cause it gets attacked almost every single day.

112
00:08:57,157 --> 00:09:03,108
The humvee I was riding in took a direct hit from an RPG...

113
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:05,914
and it was mayhem.

114
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:12,351
My partner took a grenade right to the chest, and it blew him to shit.

115
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:17,566
I saw the dude who launched it at us about 200 yards away on top of a building.

116
00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:20,039
He was dancing.

117
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:22,479
I just snapped.

118
00:09:22,697 --> 00:09:25,369
I didn't have any weapons on me, but

119
00:09:25,461 --> 00:09:27,337
I headed straight for that building.

120
00:09:28,476 --> 00:09:29,622
Were you afraid?

121
00:09:29,707 --> 00:09:31,786
I would have done the exact same thing.

122
00:09:33,085 --> 00:09:34,827
No, it wasn't fear.

123
00:09:35,248 --> 00:09:37,560
This may sound terrible, but...

124
00:09:37,924 --> 00:09:41,236
when you're in a situation like that, and you're attacked for no reason,

125
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,527
it's hate that gets you through it.

126
00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:45,265
Even protects you.

127
00:09:47,996 --> 00:09:49,481
What did you do to him?

128
00:09:49,932 --> 00:09:53,491
Well, he was bigger than me, so he fended me off at first,

129
00:09:53,576 --> 00:09:56,374
but I finally got him down on the ground...

130
00:09:56,949 --> 00:10:01,089
and I stuck my thumbs in his eyes until they were covered in blood.

131
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,894
He started swinging wildly at the air, so I took his launcher,

132
00:10:03,969 --> 00:10:06,405
and I hit him in the head with it again and again.

133
00:10:06,744 --> 00:10:10,787
I just kept hitting him in the head until it cracked wide open.

134
00:10:11,312 --> 00:10:13,814
When I saw bone, I knew he was dead.

135
00:10:16,153 --> 00:10:17,835
What a terrible thing to experience.

136
00:10:17,928 --> 00:10:19,102
I guess.

137
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,465
I'm kind of numb to it now, though. All the blood and everything.

138
00:10:24,215 --> 00:10:27,317
You guys must know what I'm talking about. You must deal with gore every day, right?

139
00:10:27,414 --> 00:10:30,534
I don't think anyone ever gets used to slaughter.

140
00:10:32,406 --> 00:10:34,929
I see you have a wife-- Chloe.

141
00:10:35,061 --> 00:10:36,241
She must be happy you're home.

142
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:39,761
Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna be staying for a while, too.

143
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,553
The army wants me to do recruiting for them now.

144
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:47,182
I mean, that's why they're paying for all the cosmetic surgery.

145
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:53,753
So I'm going to go around to high schools and malls and stuff and get people to sign up.

146
00:11:03,783 --> 00:11:06,167
It's just like old times having you here, Liz.

147
00:11:06,258 --> 00:11:08,209
Well, don't get too excited, Christian.

148
00:11:08,306 --> 00:11:12,163
I'm only filling in today 'cause you couldn't find anybody else on such late notice.

149
00:11:12,403 --> 00:11:13,465
Is she properly tumesced?

150
00:11:13,563 --> 00:11:14,512
Yes, doctor.

151
00:11:17,808 --> 00:11:18,564
Metz.

152
00:11:29,808 --> 00:11:30,582
Cannula.

153
00:11:55,608 --> 00:11:57,376
Christian, come on!

154
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:01,206
I gave this patient enough propofol for a liposuction.

155
00:12:01,285 --> 00:12:03,804
You're scraping ice off of a car windshield.

156
00:12:03,887 --> 00:12:06,664
Tumescent liposuction leaves very little bruising.

157
00:12:06,747 --> 00:12:09,454
Just do your job and keep her under.

158
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:12,115
It's my job to minimize pain.

159
00:12:12,205 --> 00:12:15,090
Having her wake up looking like she just played linebacker

160
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,513
for the dolphins kind of defeats the purpose.

161
00:12:18,051 --> 00:12:18,911
Look...

162
00:12:19,874 --> 00:12:20,924
Look!

163
00:12:22,003 --> 00:12:25,661
After being attacked, accused of murder, rejected by your mother,

164
00:12:25,739 --> 00:12:28,708
and dumped by your bride, who wouldn't be angry?

165
00:12:29,345 --> 00:12:31,973
It makes sense. You've had a really rough year, Christian,

166
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,811
but you shouldn't be taking it out on her.

167
00:12:33,907 --> 00:12:36,502
Enough of your feminazi bullshit, Liz!

168
00:12:37,164 --> 00:12:40,197
I don't care if you don't work here full-time anymore.

169
00:12:40,328 --> 00:12:43,563
When you're assisting me, that means you're an employee,

170
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,767
which means shut up and serve the surgeon!

171
00:12:47,378 --> 00:12:50,037
This is the last favor I am gonna do for you.

172
00:12:50,116 --> 00:12:52,428
Your favor is no longer required.

173
00:12:53,074 --> 00:12:54,775
Linda can help me finish.

174
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,017
Fine.

175
00:12:57,227 --> 00:13:01,175
Ok, you reverse her slowly, and then you extubate when you can.

176
00:13:07,747 --> 00:13:08,889
15 blade.

177
00:13:25,227 --> 00:13:28,118
I heard someone painted a swastika on a locker at Matt's school.

178
00:13:28,196 --> 00:13:29,243
What do you know about it?

179
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:32,762
Nothing. Just wondered if they have any idea who did it.

180
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:34,429
Adsen pickups.

181
00:13:40,461 --> 00:13:41,290
Scissors.

182
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,024
It's funny, isn't it?

183
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:51,135
Painting a few jagged lines on a locker is considered a hate crime.

184
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:54,337
But so many things are excluded from that label.

185
00:13:54,573 --> 00:13:57,696
Rape, murder, incest.

186
00:13:57,774 --> 00:13:59,196
Why aren't they called hate crimes?

187
00:13:59,507 --> 00:14:02,399
War. That's not considered a crime at all.

188
00:14:03,304 --> 00:14:07,679
Yet hating your enemy makes it so much easier to kill them.

189
00:14:09,258 --> 00:14:12,805
What about sleeping with a colleague's ex-wife? Isn't that a hate crime?

190
00:14:13,008 --> 00:14:16,649
Why don't we just be men about this and fully address the dilemma at hand?

191
00:14:17,632 --> 00:14:18,696
I hate you.

192
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:22,352
What a coincidence. I can't wait for the day when your contract finally expires

193
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,977
and we can kick your ass out that door.

194
00:14:24,054 --> 00:14:25,399
Why don't you just do it now, Sean?

195
00:14:25,477 --> 00:14:26,602
Do it! Buy me out.

196
00:14:26,696 --> 00:14:29,430
Oh, that's right, you can't afford it.

197
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:35,729
If  you're looking for a declaration of war, Quentin, you've got it.

198
00:14:36,071 --> 00:14:38,539
The gauntlet has officially been thrown down.

199
00:14:38,914 --> 00:14:40,618
I accept your declaration.

200
00:14:40,774 --> 00:14:44,446
As uncomfortable as you try and make my life around here,

201
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,882
I have several delightful ways to make it more difficult for you.

202
00:14:47,961 --> 00:14:52,695
And then at the end of the day, I can go home and get out any leftover aggression...

203
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:54,882
by  screwing Julia.

204
00:15:02,851 --> 00:15:04,680
How are we feeling today, corporal?

205
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:06,992
Where's Dr. McNamara?

206
00:15:07,164 --> 00:15:08,602
I thought he was my surgeon.

207
00:15:08,695 --> 00:15:10,179
I'm only doing a follow-up.

208
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,993
Is that a problem?

209
00:15:13,945 --> 00:15:16,009
No. I guess you'll be fine.

210
00:15:25,304 --> 00:15:30,726
You know, I've been thinking about your story.

211
00:15:31,883 --> 00:15:33,195
It's really quite amazing.

212
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,429
Try having it happen to you.

213
00:15:37,289 --> 00:15:38,743
You must have felt so...

214
00:15:39,336 --> 00:15:40,617
so vulnerable.

215
00:15:41,828 --> 00:15:45,507
When you're under attack, you have to push those feelings down.

216
00:15:46,117 --> 00:15:47,273
Yeah.

217
00:16:09,742 --> 00:16:11,429
Well, everything is healing very nicely.

218
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:15,461
Once we remove the stitches there should be no scarring whatsoever.

219
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:17,070
All right.

220
00:16:18,536 --> 00:16:19,789
Excuse me.

221
00:16:25,945 --> 00:16:28,445
You didn't tell us you caught shrapnel down there.

222
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:31,086
You know, we could've taken care of those during the same procedure.

223
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:33,195
No, I don't want all of them fixed.

224
00:16:33,803 --> 00:16:37,353
They're souvenirs, my own badges of honor.

225
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:45,367
Well, at least let me check and make sure no keloids are forming.

226
00:17:17,468 --> 00:17:20,523
Good. That's good.

227
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:25,366
What the hell do you think you're doing? I'm not a faggot... doctor.

228
00:17:25,476 --> 00:17:27,131
I'm a married man.

229
00:17:27,242 --> 00:17:28,757
I have a wife.

230
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:46,991
I can see... why you asked for Dr. McNamara.

231
00:18:12,131 --> 00:18:14,491
Christian, hey!

232
00:18:14,725 --> 00:18:16,178
Good to see you.

233
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,241
Swank place you have here, Julia.

234
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:22,881
I can see why the patients are banging down the doors to get in.

235
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,588
I'm glad you approve.

236
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,210
Your design standards are very high, so I'm flattered.

237
00:18:28,304 --> 00:18:32,070
Can I give you a tour, get you a drink?

238
00:18:32,999 --> 00:18:34,538
Why the kid gloves?

239
00:18:34,634 --> 00:18:38,335
No. I'm just happy to see you.

240
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:43,866
You ok?

241
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:45,257
I'm fine.

242
00:18:45,977 --> 00:18:47,178
Are you sure?

243
00:18:47,554 --> 00:18:50,913
You've been through a pretty shattering experience, you know.

244
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:54,353
Why don't you just take a vacation and go somewhere--

245
00:18:54,428 --> 00:18:55,913
Enough with the pity, ok?

246
00:18:56,397 --> 00:18:58,163
I don't need a vacation.

247
00:18:58,491 --> 00:19:00,210
Kimber's already given me one.

248
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:02,835
I'm here for a patient follow-up.

249
00:19:11,953 --> 00:19:15,007
Dr. Troy, I didn't think you'd stop by.

250
00:19:15,897 --> 00:19:17,991
After all you've been through, I mean.

251
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:20,413
I heard you were ditched at the altar?

252
00:19:20,835 --> 00:19:22,663
I don't want to sound mean, Dr. Troy, but

253
00:19:22,727 --> 00:19:25,881
that ex-bride of yours sounds like a real bird-brain.

254
00:19:25,944 --> 00:19:29,630
What was she thinking? You're a rich, handsome plastic surgeon,

255
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,772
everything a woman could want.

256
00:19:31,976 --> 00:19:33,616
You're better off anyway.

257
00:19:33,726 --> 00:19:37,181
Sure, you can get any woman you want to marry you, but if you never get married,

258
00:19:37,256 --> 00:19:39,742
you can get every woman any night of the week.

259
00:19:39,838 --> 00:19:42,647
And none of them will nag you when you leave the toilet seat up. I think--

260
00:19:42,725 --> 00:19:43,710
Shut up!

261
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,335
Let's take a look at you.

262
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:50,615
That's why I'm here.

263
00:20:21,647 --> 00:20:23,021
Amazing  work.

264
00:20:23,335 --> 00:20:26,850
I feel like someone else.

265
00:20:27,491 --> 00:20:29,397
Like maybe I should change my name or something.

266
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,272
Flabby Abby's dead.

267
00:20:31,866 --> 00:20:36,428
But did you beat me with a broom handle while you were vacuuming my hips?

268
00:20:36,522 --> 00:20:39,475
Soreness is a small price to pay for beauty.

269
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:41,006
Don't you think?

270
00:20:42,337 --> 00:20:44,102
I'd have paid double.

271
00:20:46,522 --> 00:20:51,772
When can I go out and meet my Dr. Christian Troy?

272
00:20:59,147 --> 00:21:00,506
When are you checking out?

273
00:21:01,413 --> 00:21:02,990
Friday afternoon.

274
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:10,302
So why don't you stop by my place friday night around 8:00?

275
00:21:14,475 --> 00:21:15,616
Ok.

276
00:21:54,662 --> 00:21:55,444
Hey!

277
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:56,850
Hey.

278
00:21:59,991 --> 00:22:01,334
Something smells good.

279
00:22:02,131 --> 00:22:05,944
I don't think I made enough or I'd invite you to stay for dinner.

280
00:22:08,172 --> 00:22:10,146
Are you here to see Matt?

281
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:13,630
Yeah.

282
00:22:14,443 --> 00:22:15,646
Is he around?

283
00:22:15,756 --> 00:22:18,974
Yeah, he's, uh... studying with Ariel.

284
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:21,194
Good.

285
00:22:21,412 --> 00:22:22,555
I want to speak to her, too.

286
00:22:22,662 --> 00:22:25,600
No, I don't think you should disturb them, Sean.

287
00:22:25,694 --> 00:22:26,443
Why not?

288
00:22:26,537 --> 00:22:30,021
Well, you remember what you were like when we first started dating, right?

289
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:31,538
Yes, I do.

290
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:41,756
You do this, you might never be able to get him back.

291
00:22:51,023 --> 00:22:54,100
Jesus, are they having sex? Julia!

292
00:22:54,193 --> 00:22:57,490
Sean, I would rather him hanging out here than on the streets.

293
00:22:57,569 --> 00:22:59,490
I mean, worse still with Ava.

294
00:22:59,568 --> 00:23:01,193
At least Ariel's his age.

295
00:23:01,271 --> 00:23:02,647
You knew about this?

296
00:23:02,741 --> 00:23:06,022
Yes, and I gave him condoms, like you once did, Sean.

297
00:23:06,099 --> 00:23:07,068
That was different.

298
00:23:07,149 --> 00:23:09,880
Really? What, there's a double standard in terms

299
00:23:09,974 --> 00:23:12,318
of parents providing contraception to their kids?

300
00:23:12,382 --> 00:23:14,990
No! I just don't want our son having sex with her!

301
00:23:15,055 --> 00:23:17,176
That girl in there is pure evil.

302
00:23:17,255 --> 00:23:18,365
She's a teenager!

303
00:23:18,443 --> 00:23:20,537
No, she is a racist, Julia!

304
00:23:20,629 --> 00:23:22,693
Have you even had a conversation with her?

305
00:23:22,771 --> 00:23:24,663
Or is it all suddenly just about your career?

306
00:23:24,725 --> 00:23:27,865
I have been busy with the spa, but there hasn't been one thing

307
00:23:27,927 --> 00:23:30,209
going on with this family that slipped through the cracks.

308
00:23:30,287 --> 00:23:32,380
Oh, really? Here's something that slipped through the crack--

309
00:23:32,459 --> 00:23:35,084
some guy's cock in your boyfriend's ass!

310
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,412
Why would you say that?

311
00:23:36,492 --> 00:23:40,365
I caught Quentin getting rear-ended by a male patient this afternoon.

312
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,427
And I don't think he was just collecting the bill.

313
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:45,896
I can't believe your jealousy. What is it, Sean?

314
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:48,646
If I can't love you, I'm not allowed to love anyone?

315
00:23:48,709 --> 00:23:50,177
I just don't want to see you get hurt, that's all.

316
00:23:50,255 --> 00:23:54,708
Oh! You have an awful way of showing it.

317
00:23:54,786 --> 00:23:55,958
You're sleeping with him?

318
00:23:56,755 --> 00:23:59,098
If you are, make sure he double-bags it!

319
00:24:10,943 --> 00:24:12,021
What'd you say to her?

320
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:15,022
I guess there's one good thing that comes out of screwing your girlfriend in the bedroom.

321
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:17,537
Neither one of you can be out committing more hate crimes!

322
00:24:17,617 --> 00:24:19,193
What are you talking about?

323
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:21,146
It's time for you to leave, Sean.

324
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,505
You've disrupted this family enough for one day.

325
00:24:23,568 --> 00:24:27,176
Did you and your little girlfriend have anything to do with a swastika painted on a locker?

326
00:24:27,255 --> 00:24:28,379
No.

327
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:31,584
I heard you helped the girl whose locker it was hide her jewish nose.

328
00:24:31,677 --> 00:24:34,552
Sounds to me like you're an accessory to the crime, Dr. McNamara.

329
00:24:34,648 --> 00:24:36,770
Don't let her spin her web around you, Matt.

330
00:24:36,849 --> 00:24:38,037
You can do so much better than her.

331
00:24:38,132 --> 00:24:40,021
Hey! You shut your mouth.

332
00:24:40,099 --> 00:24:41,442
We're in love.

333
00:24:45,255 --> 00:24:46,411
I love you.

334
00:24:48,786 --> 00:24:50,052
I love you, too.

335
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,130
I don't have to stand for this.

336
00:25:03,255 --> 00:25:06,536
Why--why do you always have to choose hate over love, man?

337
00:25:16,754 --> 00:25:18,161
Good  afternoon, corporal.

338
00:25:18,646 --> 00:25:20,662
- Ahh, you must be--
- Chloe Brandt.

339
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,880
- Hi.
- Hi.

340
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:23,989
It's the little lady.

341
00:25:26,364 --> 00:25:28,240
You did a great job on his face.

342
00:25:28,348 --> 00:25:30,880
I have my handsome Oliver back again.

343
00:25:31,131 --> 00:25:34,098
Must be wonderful having your husband back, Mrs. Brandt.

344
00:25:34,178 --> 00:25:38,348
Oh, it is. It's as if my nightmare has ended in this dream come true.

345
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:40,709
And as soon as we find out where oliver's stationed,

346
00:25:40,752 --> 00:25:43,364
we're going to start looking for a house and try to get pregnant.

347
00:25:43,443 --> 00:25:44,817
Oh, that's--that's terrific.

348
00:25:44,896 --> 00:25:47,287
Have you had a physical since he's been back, Chloe?

349
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,427
A blood panel?

350
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,177
No. Why? Is there something I should be concerned about?

351
00:25:53,488 --> 00:25:55,943
No, no, it's a good idea.

352
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:59,301
Who knows what diseases I was exposed to in Iraq?

353
00:25:59,973 --> 00:26:04,192
I know a lot of guys who caught some sand fly parasite thing.

354
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,005
I'll make an appointment with Dr. Flickinger.

355
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,177
Honey, did you bring in my sweater?

356
00:26:11,254 --> 00:26:13,255
I don't--I don't see it.

357
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:16,489
Oh, I must've left it in the car. I'll run and go get it.

358
00:26:22,426 --> 00:26:24,723
She's lovely, corporal. You're a lucky man.

359
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:28,067
Does Chloe know about your extracurricular activities?

360
00:26:28,192 --> 00:26:29,787
I don't think I know what you mean.

361
00:26:29,865 --> 00:26:33,801
I saw you and Dr. Costa having anal intercourse, corporal Brandt.

362
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:39,739
Not only is that highly inappropriate behavior between a doctor and his patient,

363
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:45,880
but I have a strong feeling that your poor, trusting wife has no idea about it.

364
00:26:45,974 --> 00:26:49,520
Both you and Christian have had sex with patients, Sean.

365
00:26:50,092 --> 00:26:52,318
I thought it was company policy around here.

366
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:58,333
I suggest you tell your wife about it, just like I've told my wife about Dr. Costa.

367
00:26:58,426 --> 00:26:59,661
Ex-wife.

368
00:26:59,848 --> 00:27:00,973
That was a mistake.

369
00:27:01,067 --> 00:27:03,301
Ok, excuse me. Wait a minute.

370
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:07,395
Why am I caught in the middle of your crossfire, and I didn't have sex with anybody, ok?

371
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,536
I'm not a fag.

372
00:27:08,614 --> 00:27:10,754
No one's accusing you of anything, corporal.

373
00:27:10,848 --> 00:27:14,598
Dr. McNamara is just jealous because I've been seeing his ex-wife.

374
00:27:14,756 --> 00:27:16,600
It's obvious he still has a thing for her.

375
00:27:16,692 --> 00:27:19,503
I guess we can leave it up to the AMA to decide.

376
00:27:19,901 --> 00:27:22,647
I'm filing a sexual misconduct grievance.

377
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:25,552
And I'll just tell them that your personal vendetta against me

378
00:27:25,614 --> 00:27:28,567
has now inappropriately involved a patient.

379
00:27:29,911 --> 00:27:34,208
Corporal Brandt, I'm sorry to do this, but I'll give you two choices--

380
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:35,661
you can tell the reviewing medical board

381
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:39,051
Dr. Costa sexually abused you without your consent--

382
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:44,192
which will result in Dr. Costa losing his job and his license to practice,

383
00:27:44,395 --> 00:27:50,911
or you can admit that what happened was consensual and face your fate with the military.

384
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,616
Hi.

385
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:16,817
Hey.

386
00:28:19,285 --> 00:28:21,833
It's, uh... it's quiet around here.

387
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:26,254
We're down to two patients tonight.

388
00:28:26,364 --> 00:28:28,567
A bunch checked out before the weekend.

389
00:28:44,897 --> 00:28:45,958
You're tight.

390
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:50,317
What is that, um... that saying?

391
00:28:51,305 --> 00:28:56,036
The devil is the knot between your shoulder blades.

392
00:28:57,036 --> 00:28:59,285
It's been a long day.

393
00:29:09,146 --> 00:29:10,817
Let me help you relax.

394
00:29:14,801 --> 00:29:17,286
Let's christen the soaking tub.

395
00:29:40,833 --> 00:29:42,938
I need to ask you something.

396
00:29:45,848 --> 00:29:51,597
Sean told me he saw you having sex with a male patient of yours yesterday.

397
00:29:51,942 --> 00:29:53,535
He--he what?

398
00:29:54,347 --> 00:29:57,628
Quentin, if you're gay, I'll understand.

399
00:30:01,607 --> 00:30:03,113
Oh, Julia.

400
00:30:04,811 --> 00:30:08,300
Julia, don't you see what he's doing?

401
00:30:08,394 --> 00:30:09,941
That's not an answer.

402
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:14,957
He is trying to come between us.

403
00:30:15,489 --> 00:30:22,020
Don't you think it's a bit coincidental that he said he saw me screwing some guy yesterday,

404
00:30:22,475 --> 00:30:23,770
in our office,

405
00:30:23,848 --> 00:30:27,286
where my boss, your ex-husband could catch me?

406
00:30:27,724 --> 00:30:33,411
It's as if he said to you if you don't love him, you can't love anyone else.

407
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:38,347
You want to believe him?

408
00:30:38,441 --> 00:30:42,566
You'd be completely ignoring every second we ever shared.

409
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:59,566
Every second we ever shared on the dance floor, hmm?

410
00:31:01,045 --> 00:31:03,723
Every caress of our lips.

411
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,707
Every soft touch of our skin.

412
00:31:10,066 --> 00:31:13,333
Then why haven't you tried to have sex with me?

413
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:16,660
We've been dating for almost a month.

414
00:31:20,035 --> 00:31:23,050
I do things... differently.

415
00:31:24,597 --> 00:31:29,879
There's, um... an honor involved.

416
00:31:32,052 --> 00:31:34,535
Well, if this is to continue,

417
00:31:34,943 --> 00:31:39,457
I could do with a little less honor and a little more heat.

418
00:31:49,099 --> 00:31:53,051
How's that? Is that hot enough for you?

419
00:32:04,175 --> 00:32:05,222
Come on in.

420
00:32:12,832 --> 00:32:14,021
Would you like a drink?

421
00:32:15,503 --> 00:32:16,693
What about dinner? I thought-

422
00:32:16,785 --> 00:32:20,113
I thought maybe we'd just stay in.

423
00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:23,316
That's a great idea.

424
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:26,596
I'll have a white wine spritzer.

425
00:32:27,584 --> 00:32:30,160
I heard there's less calories in a spritzer, right?

426
00:32:30,441 --> 00:32:31,816
Don't want to get fat again.

427
00:32:37,661 --> 00:32:39,800
Christian, I want to thank for this.

428
00:32:40,707 --> 00:32:43,910
You've already given me more than I could ever imagine.

429
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:55,628
Don't guzzle, Abby. I want you to be fully conscious for what's happening next.

430
00:33:05,582 --> 00:33:08,816
What are you doing? You look like a trout.

431
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:14,549
I'm sorry. Did you want to make out?

432
00:33:15,019 --> 00:33:21,003
Before we do, why don't you slip into something a little more comfortable?

433
00:33:22,847 --> 00:33:24,816
I didn't bring anything.

434
00:33:24,895 --> 00:33:26,832
That's ok. I went shopping.

435
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,831
It's on the bed.

436
00:33:58,734 --> 00:34:00,050
That's a bag.

437
00:34:00,628 --> 00:34:01,832
Yes.

438
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,503
I thought you said you went shopping.

439
00:34:05,362 --> 00:34:08,050
I did, grocery shopping. And I recycle.

440
00:34:08,143 --> 00:34:11,472
And now I would like to make good use of that bag.

441
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:15,081
I want you to put it on.

442
00:34:17,196 --> 00:34:18,566
What do you mean?

443
00:34:18,674 --> 00:34:20,409
If you want to have sex with me,

444
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:24,535
you have to put the bag over head so I can't see your face.

445
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,582
You won't suffocate, if that's what you are worried about.

446
00:34:31,128 --> 00:34:33,862
C'mon, Abby. How many chances in life are you going to get

447
00:34:33,941 --> 00:34:35,800
to sleep with someone like me?

448
00:34:35,893 --> 00:34:36,847
Hmm?

449
00:34:37,852 --> 00:34:39,393
You want me or not?

450
00:34:41,858 --> 00:34:43,394
- Yes.
- Speak up.

451
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:45,706
I said yes. I want you.

452
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:48,409
Then put it on.

453
00:36:16,721 --> 00:36:19,252
I understand why you went into the military, corporal.

454
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:23,459
It gives you an opportunity to role play, hide from your true self.

455
00:36:24,237 --> 00:36:25,768
That's funny, Dr. Costa.

456
00:36:26,721 --> 00:36:31,112
Hiding your true self from Dr. McNamara seems to be exactly what you had to do.

457
00:36:31,332 --> 00:36:33,127
Have you made up your mind?

458
00:36:34,143 --> 00:36:36,393
Are you going to be a man and tell the truth?

459
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:40,299
Or are you going to lie in an attempt to ruin my career to save yours?

460
00:36:40,393 --> 00:36:42,456
Doesn't seem like much of a choice to me.

461
00:36:44,696 --> 00:36:47,690
Why would I do anything to save your sorry ass?

462
00:36:49,734 --> 00:36:51,565
As much as I enjoyed it.

463
00:36:52,409 --> 00:36:53,784
You're not a hero.

464
00:36:54,862 --> 00:36:59,003
To you, it's more respectable to kill a man, than it is to be a homosexual.

465
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:02,971
And you'd rather ruin everything I stand for than to fight your own battles.

466
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:06,987
Isn't the doctor's creed to "first do no harm"?

467
00:37:07,924 --> 00:37:09,471
That's a good point.

468
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:12,864
Because I helped you today, corporal.

469
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:17,424
This morning I called your commanding officer and informed him of who you are--

470
00:37:17,534 --> 00:37:21,112
gay and a coward.

471
00:37:21,752 --> 00:37:22,941
You did what?

472
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:25,768
I talked to colonel Watterson.

473
00:37:26,783 --> 00:37:29,456
I told him I'd go under oath if necessary.

474
00:37:31,556 --> 00:37:33,113
You asshole.

475
00:37:39,546 --> 00:37:41,377
Now it's time you faced him.

476
00:37:58,816 --> 00:38:00,799
We don't need you for this surgery, Quentin.

477
00:38:00,892 --> 00:38:01,987
Why don't you just go home?

478
00:38:02,081 --> 00:38:03,346
Or why don't you head down to the docks?

479
00:38:03,424 --> 00:38:07,409
I hear there's a whole bunch of sailors just arrived with 3-day passes.

480
00:38:07,862 --> 00:38:11,393
I've been thinking, gentlemen, and I've decided to make you a deal.

481
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:16,642
We all know it's become an unpleasant work environment around here,

482
00:38:16,721 --> 00:38:19,580
and I'm not wanted. So...

483
00:38:20,237 --> 00:38:22,487
I'll make you an offer you can't refuse.

484
00:38:23,237 --> 00:38:24,456
We're listening.

485
00:38:25,518 --> 00:38:30,784
Buy out the remainder of my contract at 50¢ on the dollar.

486
00:38:32,751 --> 00:38:36,299
Fine. We'll have our lawyers draw up the paperwork in the morning.

487
00:38:36,377 --> 00:38:38,602
No, no, no. There's no need to wait that long.

488
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,907
I've already taken care of the necessary arrangements.

489
00:38:40,955 --> 00:38:42,471
I'll leave the papers on your desk.

490
00:38:42,784 --> 00:38:44,518
No. We're taking care of this right now.

491
00:38:58,195 --> 00:38:59,893
Everything looks good to me.

492
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:01,440
You have a pen?

493
00:39:24,174 --> 00:39:25,377
I'm leaving now.

494
00:39:25,832 --> 00:39:27,470
I'll send for the rest of my things in the morning.

495
00:39:27,548 --> 00:39:29,127
That's a wonderful idea.

496
00:39:29,487 --> 00:39:31,237
Why the change of heart, Quentin?

497
00:39:31,659 --> 00:39:35,705
Did you suddenly realize Atlanta had a brand new crop of patients to bugger?

498
00:39:38,095 --> 00:39:41,768
Actually, Christian, I'm staying right here in Miami.

499
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:46,627
I took a job as the plastic surgeon in residence at spa De La Mer.

500
00:39:50,533 --> 00:39:52,536
I'm working for Julia.

501
00:40:43,355 --> 00:40:44,706
"Dear Christian,

502
00:40:45,189 --> 00:40:49,173
I've thought about you reading this letter ever since the day I left.

503
00:40:49,626 --> 00:40:53,641
For your sake, I hope you've moved on and barely remember my name.

504
00:40:54,783 --> 00:40:59,268
Please know that leaving you on your wedding day was the last thing I wanted to do.

505
00:40:59,658 --> 00:41:04,471
I tried to say this to you so many times before, but couldn't do it.

506
00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:06,020
So I just left.

507
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:09,956
But the words still need to be said.

508
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:13,189
We were never meant to spend our lives together.

509
00:41:14,393 --> 00:41:16,705
There is one thing I thank you for--

510
00:41:17,112 --> 00:41:20,236
forcing me to choose between you and my career.

511
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:24,595
You helped me realize that my career gives me everything I need--

512
00:41:24,705 --> 00:41:28,220
individuality, empowerment, autonomy--

513
00:41:28,456 --> 00:41:33,236
while being your wife would only strip me of my dignity and sense of self.

514
00:41:34,564 --> 00:41:36,706
So I chose me over you.

515
00:41:37,252 --> 00:41:40,845
You probably hate me for it, and for that, I'm sorry.

516
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:45,426
Don't try and find me. I never wanna see you again.

517
00:41:45,517 --> 00:41:48,502
It would be too painful and nothing would be gained.

518
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,081
Goodbye. Kimber.

519
00:42:07,439 --> 00:42:10,410
Why are you making me do this?

520
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:16,877
The letter.

521
00:42:22,174 --> 00:42:23,251
Thank you.

522
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:30,020
No. Stop.

523
00:42:30,315 --> 00:42:30,987
God.

524
00:42:40,047 --> 00:42:41,143
Christian?

525
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,126
What are you doing here?

526
00:42:53,564 --> 00:42:58,236
Did you finally find an ounce of respect and come to tell me what an asshole I am?

527
00:43:00,362 --> 00:43:02,501
You and I are very similar, you know.

528
00:43:03,564 --> 00:43:05,096
I know you hate me,

529
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:07,173
but I'm ok with it.

530
00:43:07,798 --> 00:43:09,298
Because I hate me, too.

531
00:43:11,955 --> 00:43:13,891
You couldn't be more pathetic.

532
00:43:16,048 --> 00:43:18,595
Yeah, I know. You've made that pretty clear.

533
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,486
But, Christian, that's cool with me.

534
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,673
I like that I don't have to worry if you'll ever love me.

535
00:43:25,782 --> 00:43:29,626
I don't have to try to please you. It would only waste my time.

536
00:43:32,751 --> 00:43:34,236
Don't you get it?

537
00:43:35,455 --> 00:43:39,267
Last night, those weren't tears of humiliation you saw.

538
00:43:39,548 --> 00:43:42,207
They were tears of joy.

539
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:47,408
I had the first orgasm of my life with you.

540
00:43:50,267 --> 00:43:54,910
I went online to try and get information about my feelings.

541
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:59,408
According to the web sites, I must be a masochist.

542
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:03,923
And you, you're definitely a sadist.

543
00:44:06,797 --> 00:44:08,580
We're made for each other.

544
00:44:25,952 --> 00:44:30,142
Anytime you want me, just let me know.

545
00:44:32,408 --> 00:44:34,533
Then I'll wear the bag again.

546
00:44:34,845 --> 00:44:36,298
I don't mind.

547
00:44:46,314 --> 00:44:48,423
Be at my place tonight at 9:00.

548
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,800
