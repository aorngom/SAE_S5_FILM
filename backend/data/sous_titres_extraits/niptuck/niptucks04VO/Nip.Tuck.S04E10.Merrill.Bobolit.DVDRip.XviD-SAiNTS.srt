1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,189
Previously on Nip / Tuck...

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,998
Allow me to introduce myself.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,198
I'm Escobar Gallardo.
The former boss of Sylvio Perez.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,157
My brother would like a new nose.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,117
- What happened?
- I killed my brother.

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,111
You chose the right family, Alejandro.

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,111
What are we supposed to do
with this body?

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,317
Hi. I'm Merrill, and I'm a drug addict.

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,550
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for this man.

10
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,993
What are you planning on doing, Merrill?

11
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,117
If I can't have your life,
I'll just take your face.

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,315
I said what I always say,
whatever it takes to get me laid.

13
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,230
You really are a beautiful soul,
Matthew McNamara.

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,191
I don't wanna lie to you, Sean.

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,998
I was at Marlowe's.

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,309
Married?

17
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,031
- What kind of joke is this?
- This isn't a joke, Christian.

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,997
Matt and I exchanged our vows
three days ago.

19
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,115
Three days ago?

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,235
I'm eighteen now. I can do...

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,788
I'm just gonna handle this. Go get my bag.

22
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,758
The Church is Matt's family now

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,671
and we both know
how you feel about that.

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,990
Inviting you would've been a mistake.

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,394
But you're still his parents, and we do
feel bad that you couldn't be there.

26
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,391
But I thought this might help.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,434
You can pick out the ones you like
and we'll send you copies.

28
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,149
Really? You sure you won't have to check
with the mothership first?

29
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,040
See? This is why neither one of you
are in my life anymore.

30
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,031
You can't be happy for me
no matter what I do, right?

31
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,109
That's ridiculous, Matt.

32
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,235
That's like saying we should be happy

33
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,197
if you're a drug addict
and just scored a bag of heroin.

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,793
And don't think
I don't know what you're doing.

35
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,233
You married Matt to get back at me.

36
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,788
Christian, I was done with you
a long time ago.

37
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,758
Really, I think you're the one
who needs to let go.

38
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,032
Matt, this just seems so abrupt.
I mean, you were gonna go to college.

39
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,833
What're you gonna do
to support yourself now?

40
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,832
The Church has a lot of opportunity
available to me. I'll work there.

41
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,239
Cleaning up trash. Big future in that.

42
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,437
Now, why can't you both just admit
what you're really pissed about, okay?

43
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,592
Your own lives have failed
and I'm doing great!

44
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,030
I mean, really,
it's a wonder I turned out this well!

45
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,155
Turned out well?

46
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,312
Going from dating a transsexual
to marrying a faded porn star

47
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,913
is not doing well in my mind!

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,116
They're just trying to control you.
Sit down.

49
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,474
- All right.
- And stay quiet!

50
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,629
- You leave!
- He's being polite.

51
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,156
Get the hell out of here before
I kick you out! I need to talk to my son!

52
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,434
But this is a consult.

53
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,557
And I have every right
to have my husband in a consult.

54
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,277
Now, besides filling you in
on our marriage,

55
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,432
I made an appointment
because I needed a little work done.

56
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,432
You think either one of us
would ever operate on you again?

57
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,398
Well, I think you'd be pissed
if I didn't give you the opportunity.

58
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,631
Besides, it'd be
in your best interest, Grandpa.

59
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,515
That's right. We're pregnant.

60
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,712
And if I'm going to have any chance
at breastfeeding our son,

61
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,711
I'll need my implants removed.

62
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,950
Just think of the operation
as a wedding gift to us.

63
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,433
What are you doing?

64
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,313
Now that Marlowe
isn't working here anymore,

65
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,870
I can finally paint over this monstrosity
without offending him.

66
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,357
Don't just stand there.
I bought a roller for you, too.

67
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,996
Conor loved this mural.

68
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,118
It agitated him.

69
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,919
All the darkness and movement.

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,560
It's what was keeping him
from sleeping well.

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,675
That's probably why Marlowe paints
these things in his client's nurseries,

72
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,069
to ensure that he gets to stick around.

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,036
I wish you'd asked me first.

74
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,159
Well, I just assumed, now that Marlowe
was gone, we'd wanna move on.

75
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,358
Besides, I didn't think
I needed to ask permission

76
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,715
to paint a wall in my own house.

77
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,713
No, you don't.
But it doesn't mean I'm gonna help you.

78
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,512
- How's Michelle holding up?
- She won't return my calls.

79
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,751
All I know is she's in Houston
with Burt's attorneys

80
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,193
and spreading his ashes.

81
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,759
We sent flowers.

82
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,639
So, what did Julia say
when you told her about Matt?

83
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,869
She was upset.

84
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,752
Then again,
she's dealing with her own secret.

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,150
She's having an affair with Marlowe.

86
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,159
That's ridiculous.

87
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,310
- Julia and Marlowe?
- Just 'cause of the size doesn't mean...

88
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,311
No, because he's the nanny.

89
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,435
You banged the nanny,

90
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,318
now your guilty conscience is making
you think she's banging the nanny.

91
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,311
- So, I'm just being paranoid?
- Do you have any proof?

92
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,470
I don't need proof. I have my gut.

93
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,911
You know what my gut's telling me?
My gut is telling me it's not Matt's kid.

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,719
I didn't wanna say it
in front of the poor guy,

95
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,631
but I screwed Kimber recently.

96
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,472
Wait a minute.
Are you saying it's your baby now?

97
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,348
Well, my sperm certainly knows its way
around her uterus better than his.

98
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,476
And you know she only married him
to get to me.

99
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,189
Have you ever had a baby
that someone else didn't think was theirs?

100
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,914
Once I find out that the kid is mine,
I'll handle Matt, all right?

101
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,874
No need for the kid to suffer my mistake.

102
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,388
Will you turn that shit off?
I've had enough torture for one day.

103
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,393
- Oh, I wouldn't count on that.
- What?

104
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,550
What ever happened to, "How you doing?"
"Looking great"?

105
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,119
"Good to see you got out"?

106
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,431
Last time I saw you, Merrill,
you tried to cut my face off.

107
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,032
Fair enough.
But I was under the influence of narcotics.

108
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,630
And that bitch, Madam Rose.

109
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,711
Is that what you told the judge?

110
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,153
How'd you get out so fast anyway?
I thought they got you on manslaughter.

111
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,117
I cut a deal. Squealed like a pig.

112
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,395
Madam Rose was the one
that killed the girl.

113
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,075
I was just a poor soul addicted
to the nitrous she was feeding me.

114
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,398
I pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting,

115
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,869
and then I got a 32-month
slap on the wrist.

116
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,838
You always were good
at squirreling your way out of things.

117
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,319
More like ratting.

118
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,520
You know what the prosecutors
don't tell you,

119
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,475
is that rats are the lowest form
of pond scum in prison.

120
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,669
I was fresh fish target numero uno.

121
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,116
Tell it to your parole officer, Merrill.
I don't give a shit.

122
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,435
They raped me, Christian. Repeatedly.

123
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,758
They passed me around
for a year and a half,

124
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,469
and now I can't even leave the house
without fear of shitting my pants.

125
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,038
What do you want me to do?

126
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,318
I need an anal retread.

127
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,438
That's a pretty expensive
procedure, Merrill.

128
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,714
I assume you don't have insurance.

129
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,994
Of course not.

130
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,954
But you'll be doing the surgery for free.

131
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,754
Unless you wanna end up in prison
takin' it like a woman, too.

132
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,114
Excuse me?

133
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,433
The only way for a guy like me to protect
himself on the inside is get married.

134
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,991
It's not like I wore a white dress
and danced to Unforgettable, Christian.

135
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,992
I became someone's prison wife.
Someone more powerful than me.

136
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,389
- A bitch.
- I prefer the term "prag".

137
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,237
I cleaned, I did the laundry,
I serviced him when he needed it.

138
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,880
You'd have done the same thing
in my situation, trust me.

139
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,157
- I'm no one's bitch, Merrill.
- Everyone is someone's bitch.

140
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,794
Wasn't too bad, actually.

141
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,077
I found it somewhat liberating to have
all of my choices taken away from me.

142
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,195
Must be one hell of a guy.

143
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,909
It usually takes at least six karats
for a bitch to give it up like that.

144
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,389
They don't have wedding rings in prison.

145
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,750
Marriage is symbolized

146
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,471
by the branding of the husband's name
on the wife's ass.

147
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,878
- Wanna see who my husband is?
- Not really.

148
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,756
Who's the bitch now, Christian?

149
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,429
Oh, man!

150
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,670
You should see your face.
I knew I should've brought a camera.

151
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,716
My retread aside,
my hubby has some medical conditions.

152
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,359
He wants you and Sean
to come and see him.

153
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,398
Tell him I'll come visit him
when he's in the prison cemetery.

154
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,232
I wouldn't refuse him,

155
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,833
unless you want him
to start blabbing about

156
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,514
your mutual friend in the Everglades.

157
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,434
Dr. McNamara.

158
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,511
To what do I owe the pleasure?

159
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,115
Nice.

160
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,320
A little depressing, but I understand why,

161
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,752
considering your mood.

162
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,755
Come again?

163
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,910
Since you canceled your surgery,

164
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,356
I assumed something happened
with the girl you were doing it for.

165
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,953
You guys break up?

166
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,350
Do you always make house calls
to patients with cold feet?

167
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,955
No.

168
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,158
But you were our nanny.

169
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,795
You were a member of our family, right?

170
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,116
Yeah, we're taking some time apart.

171
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,390
I don't know what I was thinking.

172
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,593
I guess women
make us do crazy things sometimes.

173
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,559
Why did you split up?

174
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,359
Did she snore?

175
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,596
Didn't like your taste in movies?

176
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,269
Or was she married?

177
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,839
As a child, I learned early on

178
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,071
that if I was going to compete
in a world that was taller than I was,

179
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,912
I needed to go straight at things.

180
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,151
- No pussyfooting.
- Are you having an affair with my wife?

181
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,476
Julia and I have an intimacy that goes
beyond just employer and employee,

182
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,597
probably more than just even friends.

183
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,955
But it was never physical.

184
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,113
Are you gonna hit me?

185
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,959
How about now?

186
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,754
Do you think that'll make you
more of a man?

187
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,476
Do you think that'll impress Julia?

188
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,956
I painted over your mural.

189
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,275
Belts, too. Anything with metal on it.

190
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,989
How do we know
he doesn't have a weapon?

191
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,756
Four members of the MS-13 lit his face
on fire with lighter fluid last week.

192
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,391
Got third-degree burns on his hands,
trying to put it out.

193
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,716
You got nothing to worry about.

194
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,189
On the gate!

195
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,918
- I'll holler when we're done, Van!
- Sure thing, boss.

196
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,192
So you got my message, huh?

197
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,473
- Thank you for coming so quickly, man.
- Didn't sound like we had a choice.

198
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,189
Don't worry.

199
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,989
I didn't tell Merrill our little secret.
About the swamp?

200
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,879
He's just an errand boy.
You guys look good.

201
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,231
So, should I tell you what I don't like
about myself

202
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,753
or is that too obvious right now?

203
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,875
We'll fix your face for you.

204
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,918
Who do you wanna look like?
Charles Manson or Hitler?

205
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,239
I must admit, that was some clever shit
you guys pulled, you know?

206
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,356
Turning me into
the FBl's "Most Wanted" like that.

207
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,829
Here's what you'll look like
four months after surgery.

208
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,195
On your knees. Hands behind your head.

209
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,358
Actually worked to my advantage
for a while, too.

210
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,477
I copped a plea
the real Escobar never would've gotten.

211
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,390
I was told I'd be out in 18 years.

212
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,199
Only I didn't realize
that the man you turned me into

213
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,789
shot a federal agent

214
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,111
because he was about to be arrested
for child molestation charges.

215
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,918
Is that why they burned your face?

216
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,230
You can kill a hundred cops,
come in here and run the joint.

217
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,959
General population finds out
that you banged a six-year-old,

218
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,871
it doesn't go over too well.

219
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,479
You become a target.

220
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,833
One thing prison has taught me,

221
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,354
you live and die
not just based on who you are,

222
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,317
but on who people perceive you to be.

223
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,072
Not much different from your line of work.

224
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,310
So if I'm going to spend
the next 15 years in here,

225
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,789
I want to go back to being
the man that I was.

226
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,110
- The Escobar people feared.
- Doesn't make sense.

227
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,636
They'll find out they got the wrong guy,
you'll go back on trial and get life.

228
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,156
I'll take spending an entire lifetime in here
as the man I am

229
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,479
before I live another day
as the bottom feeder that I'm seen as now.

230
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,149
A pervert.

231
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,198
Quite like Sylvio Perez.

232
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,669
You know, the man that you wrapped
in hams and threw in the swamp?

233
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,433
Hopefully, they're gonna get confused
and eat everything.

234
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,670
Then there won't be any trace left.

235
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,350
You don't have any proof of that.

236
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,914
No, I don't. But Alejandro does.

237
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,639
Do you remember him? Sylvio's brother?

238
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,395
You don't think I would let you
dispose of Sylvio's body yourselves.

239
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,035
I had Alejandro follow you to the swamp.

240
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,190
Which means that I know
where the evidence is.

241
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,793
So you better fix me.

242
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,075
Or, I don't know, maybe I'll direct certain
authorities to the scene of your crime.

243
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,394
You're full of shit.

244
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,632
Amigo, if I was full of shit,
you wouldn't be here right now.

245
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,359
But did you miss me?

246
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,751
Let me see what they did to you.

247
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,274
Jesus...

248
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,715
I don't know how much we can do for you,
especially in this chop shop.

249
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,279
I've already arranged with the warden

250
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,828
to have all the work done
at McNamara/Troy.

251
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,675
I take care of his heroin habit,
he takes care of me.

252
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,231
I'm not asking for a miracle.

253
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,032
Just do your best.

254
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,351
I know you still remember
what I look like, Sean.

255
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,071
You sure you don't want me
to take off the brand, Merrill?

256
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,309
Never.

257
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,474
Escobar saved my life.
I owe him my loyalty.

258
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,000
You know, most of the damage was done
before he started protecting me

259
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,640
or when he loaned me out
in exchange for favors.

260
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,793
And just so we're clear, Christian,
being a prag isn't about going queer.

261
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,389
It's about surrender.

262
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,629
From the condition your anus is in,

263
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,314
it looks like you surrendered
to the entire South Florida Penal System.

264
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,879
I expected that kind of cynicism

265
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,554
from a man who's never
fully given himself to anyone or anything.

266
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,676
Come on, Merrill.
I know it was tough for you in there,

267
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,637
but you can't be serious
about all this bullshit.

268
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,029
You and I come
from a world of achievement.

269
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,872
We're doctors, plastic surgeons,

270
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,589
it's all about being the best,
the most beautiful, the winner.

271
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,194
It's goddamn exhausting is what it is.

272
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,748
Are you trying to tell me you don't get
worn down by expectations?

273
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,149
I'm trying to tell you I like being in control.

274
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,310
I like Osetra better than Beluga,

275
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,959
I like Añejo better than Reposado,

276
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,554
I like blondes who can
suck the yellow out of a canary

277
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,631
better than brunettes with great asses.

278
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,188
I like them when I want them,
and I like them how I want them.

279
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:43,400
Which means, Merrill, no matter how
hard you try, you could never be like me.

280
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,873
Speaking of blondes who blow,
how's Kimber?

281
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,037
I wrote her a bunch of letters from prison,

282
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,908
but she must have changed her address
because she never wrote me back.

283
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,234
Consider yourself lucky.

284
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,550
Her venom has become more potent
with age.

285
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,551
She's still got her claws in you?

286
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,039
I wish it was just me.

287
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,189
Since you've been gone,

288
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,955
she has screwed, and screwed over,
me, Sean and now my son.

289
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,077
- Well, her pimp hand is strong.
- Bullshit.

290
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,277
The only thing strong about her
are her vagina muscles.

291
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,272
When you're tired of those,
she ain't got nothing.

292
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,554
I don't know, Christian.

293
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,153
She may never have had
her dick up your ass,

294
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,515
but she's always had you by the balls.

295
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,153
Kimber plays like she's a bottom,

296
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,596
but no matter how beat up she seems,
she's always in control.

297
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,191
She's like those 300-pound
juggernauts in prison.

298
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,350
You wanna take her down,
you gotta sneak up behind her,

299
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,637
and club her over the head
before she knows what happened.

300
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,836
I'll be outside if you need me.

301
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,278
You're not gonna get all squeamish
like that in surgery, are you?

302
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,316
I need you 100%, Sean.

303
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,110
Or what?
You'll get a referral, go someplace else?

304
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,551
What are you so uptight about, man?

305
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,029
I'm doing you a favor
by not turning you in, remember?

306
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,510
All I want is an operation
in exchange for your freedom.

307
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,639
You should show a little appreciation
for my generosity.

308
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,948
Appreciation?

309
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:31,315
Your life could be so much worse
right now if I wanted it to be.

310
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,630
You have no idea
what my life is right now.

311
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,835
Poor baby.

312
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,915
Did someone lose your shirt
at the dry clean?

313
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,911
You think you're the only one
with problems?

314
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,037
My son just married my partner's
ex-girlfriend because he got her pregnant,

315
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,758
and I just found out my wife
is having an affair.

316
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,674
So you go ahead. You tell me how much
worse my life could be right now!

317
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,793
That pretty wife of yours...
What'd you do to her?

318
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,829
Sean, if she's stepping out on you,
you must've did something to piss her off.

319
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,480
You two not bang steady anymore or...

320
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,757
You bang someone else and she find out?
I knew it. I knew it.

321
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,717
You don't know what happened.

322
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,792
Yeah, but I know
what you need to do now.

323
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,518
Kill the man she slept with, right?

324
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,239
Come on.
What do you think I am, Sean, an animal?

325
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,515
All I was gonna tell you was to go home,

326
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,034
confess what you did, beg for forgiveness,

327
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,078
and then bang your wife
like you've never banged her before, man.

328
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,197
See, a real man
takes responsibility for his action.

329
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,396
He stands up to his mistake.

330
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,916
Hell, I'd be proud if my son
married the girl he knocked up.

331
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,353
I'm not like you.

332
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,995
My wife finds out what I did, she'll leave.

333
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,275
If she screwed around,
you're both on even ground.

334
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,874
You got a good chance
to save your marriage.

335
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,797
You keep trying to live a lie,
bad shit happens.

336
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,873
I'm living proof.

337
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,990
- Feel my finger.
- Thank you.

338
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,318
- Feel my finger.
- Thank you.

339
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,793
I think it's working.

340
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,160
I had awful morning sickness with Matt,

341
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,071
and the only thing
that would make me better

342
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,151
was a Coke and a bag of Twizzlers.

343
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,748
We believe that any pain in the body

344
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,718
is caused by a lack of communication
with the area.

345
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,870
Touch assist allows us to reconnect.

346
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,757
- Shall we continue?
- Please.

347
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,438
So, my baby's reactive mind will record
anything that's said during the birth?

348
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,555
Any words.

349
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,551
Even "push" or "you're doing great"

350
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,437
implant themselves in the infant's brain

351
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,829
and affect his emotional well-being
for the rest of his life.

352
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,751
That's what a silent birth is all about.

353
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,638
I hear that Kelly Preston gave birth
to both of her children silently.

354
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,472
Who's Kelly Preston?

355
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,030
Honey, will you go get me
a glass of water?

356
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,109
Yeah.

357
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,514
He's preclear.

358
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,508
Well, you know, I hope you're planning
on getting an epidural, Kimber,

359
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,878
because, you know, while Kelly Preston
may have a very high tolerance for pain,

360
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,518
there is not one woman I know

361
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,797
who can get through natural childbirth
without saying anything.

362
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,950
Well, I'm not taking any drugs.

363
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,553
The Church doesn't prohibit it,

364
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,475
but they do feel that a drugless delivery is
best for the child in terms of development.

365
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,032
- Can I say "ouch"?
- We prefer if you just moaned.

366
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,915
Okay. What about "ow"?

367
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,596
More like...

368
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,795
Thank you.

369
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,475
This is flat water, Matt.
I need sparkling water for my stomach.

370
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,079
Oh, I'm sorry.

371
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,438
You should be sorry.

372
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,033
How am I supposed to feel comfortable

373
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,317
with you caring for our child
when you can't get a glass of water right?

374
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,469
Jesus.

375
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,039
- Hey.
- Hey.

376
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,192
Listen, I really appreciate
you coming over here for this, Mom.

377
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,157
- Yeah.
- I mean, to tell you the truth,

378
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,516
I'm scared shitless
and I'm gonna really need you to lean on.

379
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,160
I just want you to be happy, Matty.

380
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,355
Yeah, I am.

381
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,275
Really?

382
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,196
I'm not gonna defend the Church
to you, too, Mom.

383
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,872
No. The Church, I can handle.

384
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,269
It's your relationship with Kimber
that worries me.

385
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,396
You need a partnership to raise a child.

386
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,118
What, like you and Dad
were always partners?

387
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,919
No. We always respected each other.

388
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,671
Kimber and I,
we're just working out the kinks.

389
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,751
Christ, we've only been married
for a couple of days.

390
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,638
Sweetheart, these were meant to be
the easy weeks.

391
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,439
I just don't want you to be blinded by lust.

392
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,034
Thanks.

393
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,998
Julia, Matt and I are in love.

394
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,390
And I understand
that becoming a grandmother

395
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,910
brings up complicated feelings,
but please don't make that our problem.

396
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,231
My 18-year-old son
is having a child with a woman

397
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,993
who happens to have slept
with both of his fathers.

398
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,117
There is nothing complicated
about my feelings.

399
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,679
- Mom...
- I'm gonna handle this, Matt.

400
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,159
This is what I'm talking about.

401
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,313
A silent childbirth is just the beginning.
You want a silent marriage, too?

402
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,675
Now is not a good time, Christian.

403
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,709
Hey.

404
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,668
- What are you doing here?
- Leaving.

405
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,751
Well, don't eat anything past 9:00.

406
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,070
I got you scheduled for surgery
first thing in the morning.

407
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,071
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

408
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,915
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!

409
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,197
Well, I can't have my grandson
drinking silicone-tasting milk, now, can I?

410
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,074
Thank you.

411
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,795
Thank you.

412
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,758
Thanks for doing that.

413
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,549
I didn't have time after the last coat.

414
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,753
You did a nice job.

415
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,710
I think it was the right thing to do.

416
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,198
Get a fresh start.

417
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,831
There's something
that we need to talk about, Julia.

418
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,990
Let me be the one to say it, Sean.

419
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,911
Marlowe and I had an affair.

420
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,711
He told me you went and confronted him
about it.

421
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,549
And I feel you've known for a long time,

422
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,472
and I don't want to cover it up anymore.

423
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,478
- You're admitting you had an affair?
- I'm sorry.

424
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,869
It's just that, you know,
with everything that's happened,

425
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:11,552
with Conor and Matt getting married,
I just can't keep these lies down anymore.

426
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,353
Why would you? With him?

427
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,877
Because he accepted Conor
before he was even born

428
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,633
and all you wanted to do was change him!

429
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,869
How many times
did you have sex with him?

430
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,190
- Oh! God, Sean!
- Did he make you come?

431
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,710
- Yes, he did!
- How did you do it, the sex?

432
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,268
- Missionary? Doggie-style?
- Stop it! This is hurtful.

433
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,157
The truth is hurtful, Julia!

434
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,959
That's why we haven't been honest
all these months.

435
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,315
Maybe the truth is all that's left
in this marriage.

436
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,551
Maybe the truth is we should
never have gotten back together.

437
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,915
Well, then how are those details
going to help now?

438
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,434
Because it's the only honest conversation
we can have right now,

439
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,636
and I am entitled to an answer!

440
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,948
- Was his size an issue?
- No.

441
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,632
And I made him wear a condom,
and it was tender and beautiful.

442
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,551
Do you hate me more now?

443
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,789
No.

444
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,069
No.

445
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,669
I forgive you.

446
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,273
And you're right.

447
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,431
The only way we can get through this
is complete honesty.

448
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,748
There's nothing left for us at this point.

449
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,711
You know what worries me?

450
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:32,677
If we still love each other, then why
is it that all we do is hurt each other?

451
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,956
- Saying your goodbyes?
- I'm gonna miss them.

452
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,591
But I guess my body
doesn't belong to me anymore, right?

453
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,709
What's that?

454
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,509
This is a sonogram, so that
we can monitor the fetal heartbeat.

455
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,511
Make sure that the baby's okay
during surgery.

456
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,990
That's thoughtful of you, Christian,
but you're operating on my breasts.

457
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,548
- Why do I need to be numb below them?
- Good question.

458
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,438
When you operate on the woman
who's carrying your grandchild, Linda,

459
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,988
then you can have a say
in what's going on.

460
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,395
The epidural will help
slow down the blood flow

461
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,792
and it will also help in a speedy recovery.

462
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,951
- Wanna see your baby?
- Yeah.

463
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,112
- I assume you don't plan on watching.
- No.

464
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,833
- Feel that?
- No.

465
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,189
Good.

466
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,629
10-blade.

467
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,195
Not yet.

468
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,198
- What are you doing, Dr. Troy?
- It's my baby. I know it.

469
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,679
I just need proof.

470
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,916
This is a very sensitive procedure.

471
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,951
I'd hate to see Kimber flinch.

472
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,913
I'm gonna tell her
once she gets out of here.

473
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,231
You can do whatever the hell you want.
I don't give a damn.

474
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,829
Hey.

475
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,473
She's fine.

476
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,237
Thank you so much, Christian.

477
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,235
Look, I know you don't approve
of any of this, but I want you to know

478
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,959
that I'm committed to being
a good husband and a good father,

479
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,430
and I'm just counting on you
for your support.

480
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,880
You know what a good husband
and father does?

481
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,277
He pays the bills. He sets an example.

482
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,639
You're a loser, Matty.

483
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,190
This is the latest and greatest
in a long line of loser choices.

484
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,159
How can you say that to me
after my wife's just had surgery?

485
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,550
Your wife is a whore
who married you to piss me off!

486
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,358
Now, why don't you do something
to finally make me proud

487
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,078
and dump the bitch? Huh?

488
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,875
Why, so you can have her for yourself?

489
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,589
Look, Kimber and that baby

490
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,238
are the only thing in my life
that you can't take...

491
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,790
Don't be so naive, Matt.
That baby belongs to me.

492
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,758
- And I plan on proving it.
- What the hell is that?

493
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,797
This is DNA taken from your wife's uterus.

494
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,598
This will show us who the real daddy is.

495
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,309
Wait a minute.
And she gave you permission to take that?

496
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,630
- No.
- Man, I can't believe this.

497
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,553
You endanger
the life of my wife and my baby,

498
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,835
and you're telling me
about setting an example?

499
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,478
- What's this?
- Nothing!

500
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,991
Just a little father-son chat.

501
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,038
What a handsome devil.

502
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,076
Unfortunately, the severity of your burns
is gonna require

503
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,559
that we use extensive grafts.

504
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,313
- Extensive what?
- Donated skin.

505
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,039
The cultured tissue we're putting
on your face is grown in the lab

506
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,599
from your own cells.

507
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,758
We can't have you any closer.
This is a sterile environment.

508
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,319
Please wait outside.

509
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,432
Now, once we get started,

510
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,353
we'll remove all the dead tissue around
your face and neck.

511
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,910
After that, we will undo the jaw reshaping

512
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,073
that was performed three years ago
and remove the malar implants as well.

513
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,755
- You make it look so simple.
- Don't let that fool you.

514
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,637
You're never going to look
exactly the way that you did.

515
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,632
- Burn victims rarely do.
- We'll do our best, though.

516
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,070
Well, just to make sure that you do,

517
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,754
I have a little insurance policy
I'm taking out.

518
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,469
Hello, boys.

519
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,272
Well, I guess this makes sense.
The last time you operated was on a dog.

520
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,759
Gotta get your feet wet again
somehow, huh?

521
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,149
Relax, Christian.
I'm not touching a scalpel.

522
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,913
Just here to make sure
you really do what you say you will.

523
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,275
And I brought music. Just like I was told.

524
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,749
15-blade.

525
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,792
You guys are so good.

526
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,553
You think I can get a little sippy water?
I'll keep an eye on the patient.

527
00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:00,277
Amazing. He's gonna wake up
and he'll be the old Escobar again.

528
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,153
Back to his old tricks, I suppose, too.

529
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,152
What the hell?

530
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,032
Everyone! Please step away
from the table!

531
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,109
Put your guns down!

532
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,112
We have oxygen tanks in here.
You'll blow us all up.

533
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,788
What the hell are you doing, Merrill?

534
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,633
What I wanted to do ever since
he branded his name on my ass in prison.

535
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,119
Kill the monster!

536
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,556
How's it feel to be a helpless bitch
at the mercy of someone else?

537
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,359
If you kill him now,
you'll go right back to prison for life.

538
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,793
- Is that what you want?
- Are you kidding?

539
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,792
When everyone inside finds out
I killed Escobar Gallardo,

540
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,713
I'll be a goddamn king. A goddamn god!

541
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,836
I'll finally get the respect I deserve!

542
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,239
What's going on?

543
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,148
Let go!

544
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,193
Get him back under, quick!

545
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,431
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!

546
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,312
Let me go!

547
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:18,832
You should've let him cut his throat, Sean.
Could've solved all our problems.

548
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,518
This is a restricted area.

549
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,078
I am the night nurse.
I need to change his bandages.

550
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,714
It'll look better
when the swelling goes down.

551
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,631
Maybe one of those telenovelas
will finally come calling.

552
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,396
They only disrespected him
because you killed him, Alejandro.

553
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,475
Have a car downstairs in an hour.

554
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,432
Then we'll pay a visit
to our doctor friends together.

555
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,034
I'm going to need copies
of all of the paperwork.

556
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,678
I know the kid's mine,

557
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,830
but I'm going to need hard evidence
to convince the mother.

558
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,517
I'm happy to give you copies
of whatever you want, Dr. Troy,

559
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,910
but while there are definite markers
to indicate that you are related

560
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,194
to the child,

561
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,559
according to our testing,
you're not the father.

562
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,629
Hey.

563
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,351
Conor must be going through
a growth spurt.

564
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,874
He was up five times last night.

565
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,998
Did you get any sleep?

566
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,158
A little, between 4:00 and 4:30.

567
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,517
I sang to him, and then finally,
he went down.

568
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,915
You haven't lost your touch, have you?

569
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,237
I'm gonna jump in the shower.

570
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,750
You didn't tell her yet, did you?

571
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,631
About having the affair.
You didn't follow through.

572
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,757
I'm not listening to you anymore.
You're not even here.

573
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,192
Then you should remember
to set the alarm at night.

574
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,549
It won't be so easy for me to sneak in.

575
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,956
You're a figment of my imagination.

576
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,190
You're not really here.
You're on your way back to prison.

577
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,315
Hey, Sean.

578
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,392
You know I've been plotting this operation
for months?

579
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,392
You know what the hardest part was?

580
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,552
It wasn't bribing the guards,
blackmailing the warden,

581
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,909
or waiting two years in that hole
to put this whole thing together.

582
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,675
It was lighting my own face on fire.

583
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,990
Man, that hurt like a son of a bitch.

584
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,073
What are you doing in my house?

585
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,674
I just came by to get rid of some evidence.

586
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,355
Relax, Sean.

587
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,273
I meant the evidence of the crime
you committed.

588
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,157
Against Sylvio Perez?

589
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,871
I told you that if you fix my face,

590
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,429
I'd set you free as well, and I meant it.

591
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,788
Sean,

592
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,192
a man is nothing in this world
if he doesn't keep his word, you know?

593
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,314
It's when you don't live your life honestly
that you get into trouble.

594
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,035
Believe me, if there's anything I've learned
after being locked up,

595
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,759
it's that the truth will set you free, man.

596
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,953
I just wanted to thank you, man,

597
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,916
for giving me my old self back.

598
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,399
It's gonna be okay.

599
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,155
Okay.

600
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,912
The evidence is in the den.

601
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,308
We're even now.

602
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,591
I need to report a murder.

603
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,792
Yes, at this address.

604
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,070
No, we're no longer in any danger.

605
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,869
How long?

606
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,199
Thank you.

607
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,592
Sean, what's going on?

608
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,630
I had an affair with Monica.

609
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,629
English
