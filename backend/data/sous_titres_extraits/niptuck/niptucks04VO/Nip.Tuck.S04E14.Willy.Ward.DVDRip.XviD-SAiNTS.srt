1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,235
Previously on Nip / Tuck...

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,389
Married?

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,710
- What kind of a joke is this?
- This isn't a joke, Christian.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,711
That's right. We're pregnant.

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,677
What kind of monster are you?

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,113
This was a human being!

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,794
Imagine trying to explain this
to your future husband.

8
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,677
It could ruin everything you've worked for.

9
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,910
Christian Troy, James Sutherland.

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,437
Wilber's father. His real one.

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,715
My father named you legal guardian
in his will.

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,835
What about his mother?

13
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,390
My father was very adamant that she have
as little to do with Wilber as possible.

14
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,710
My son is back.

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,351
Look at how high he's going!

16
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,911
You wanna go higher, Wilber?

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,714
- Hold on tight.
- You're a natural mom.

18
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,999
It's easy with him.

19
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,833
You're irresistible, aren't you,
you little cutie?

20
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,112
It's impossible to be
in a bad mood with him, you know?

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,116
So, I start proceedings tomorrow
to adopt him legally.

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,313
I was just wondering, how would you feel
about being his mommy?

23
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,989
Legally?

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,879
What about the birth mother?

25
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,838
Courts ruled against her.
She's out of the picture.

26
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,599
I'm sorry, Christian,
I need to think about it.

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,679
I need to be sure.

28
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,078
I want you to be sure.

29
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,193
Right, buddy? Huh?

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,719
Yes, it's James.

31
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,476
What's the market for children's kidneys?

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,675
I have two.

33
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,278
Think I can get them for you
within a week.

34
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,838
Tell me what you don't like
about yourself, Miss Hudson.

35
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,879
Well, I just came to see
what all the fuss is about.

36
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,357
And do you like what you see?

37
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,238
Is there a particular procedure
you're interested in?

38
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,993
Well, actually, I'm in town for a
hunting trip. The Everglades.

39
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,878
And I just thought, well, shoot,
since I'm in the area,

40
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,679
I might as well
get my breasts augmented, right?

41
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,195
I think you could go up to a C-cup
with your figure.

42
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,315
Anything larger may strain...

43
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,756
You know, I just can't seem to picture you
in camouflage and orange.

44
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,515
Well, after I zero in on my prey,
I usually wear nothing at all.

45
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,235
Now, that I can picture.

46
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,389
You're bad.

47
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,235
Since I'm gonna be
your surgeon, Miss Hudson,

48
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,788
perhaps we should go into my office
and talk about the operation,

49
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,915
just the two of us.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,878
I'm sorry. I don't...
I don't mean to, you know...

51
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,873
But I'm really interested
in Dr. Troy handling me.

52
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,194
You know, I read about you

53
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,115
in Ocean Drive magazine's list
of Miami's most eligible bachelors.

54
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,634
I just cannot believe
you're only number seven.

55
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,836
Well, I hate to burst
your bubble, sweetheart,

56
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,480
but that article is a little out of date.

57
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,314
I'm happily engaged
and looking forward to family life.

58
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,749
What a pity.

59
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,949
Well...

60
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,600
I mean, you still do boob jobs, don't you?

61
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,148
I wouldn't be the doctor I am if I didn't.

62
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,075
Scoot over, Christian.

63
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,038
You don't get to have all the fun.
Gown and gloves?

64
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,349
What are you doing here?

65
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,873
Thought you'd cop a feel
while she was under?

66
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,509
I just think that we should give
Miss Hudson the best treatment we can.

67
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,113
And since I'm available, I figured

68
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,350
I'd just make sure the operation
goes as smoothly as possible.

69
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,158
Oh, Jesus, you gotta be kidding me.

70
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,118
You pull this crap every time
your fragile little ego gets bruised.

71
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,713
Boys, boys, boys.

72
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,109
This is why God gave women two breasts.

73
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,192
Now, each of you take one and go play
in your corner of the sandbox.

74
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,396
Dr. McNamara? Your 2:00 is here.

75
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,040
And you should bring some milk
and a bowl with you.

76
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,951
He's cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

77
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,874
See? There are plenty of boobs
to go around.

78
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,790
Tell me what you don't like about yourself.

79
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,472
Do you have to ask?

80
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,552
Father Time whacked him in the face
with a baseball bat.

81
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,189
Very impressive, but I think we'd move
more quickly through the consult

82
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,713
if you'd just put the dummy away.

83
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,394
No problem. Go wait in the car, dummy.

84
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,268
- Enough, Ralphy. Let me talk.
- Jeez, okay, fine.

85
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,194
He wasn't so sensitive
when his jowls didn't look like a walrus.

86
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,155
Ralphy and I have been together 30...

87
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,117
- Thirty. Thirty years.
- Thirty years. Yeah.

88
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,794
I designed him to look exactly like me.

89
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,598
He's perfect.

90
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,714
He's like another me, only better,
more confident, out there.

91
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,836
He could say the things
that I was afraid to say.

92
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,876
We had a long-term contract
with Princess Cruises.

93
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,474
- Yeah.
- We saw the world. People ate us up.

94
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,950
- Mike Douglas, Donahue.
- I felt Dinah Shore's tits.

95
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,110
Ralphy, would you please shut up?

96
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,789
And now?

97
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:11,113
This past year we booked two nights
at a dinner theater and a retirement home.

98
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,038
Sounds like you need a good agent
more than a plastic surgeon.

99
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,159
No. No, no, I need to look like Ralphy.

100
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,593
That's why the show's not working.

101
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,559
When he was an extension of me,
my other self, our schtick was charming.

102
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,638
Now it's just tragic.

103
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,072
I can't compete with him.

104
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,232
Doctor, I need a face lift,
some lipo under the chin, plugs.

105
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,390
You can use Ralphy as a template.

106
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,909
I don't mean to sound insensitive,
Mr. Ward, but why not get a new puppet?

107
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,394
No, no! No!

108
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,388
Hey! Shut up!

109
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,238
This isn't about Ralphy.

110
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,229
We used to be a team.

111
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,676
When I was the Abbott to his Costello,
we were on equal ground,

112
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,513
but now when we go out on stage,
I feel like I just disappear.

113
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,276
I need this to restore my confidence,
get my mojo back.

114
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,749
And while you're at it,
why don't you throw in a dick and balls?

115
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,592
Have you ever heard a man
sound like such a pussy?

116
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,355
God damn it, Ralphy, would you please
let me be just for a minute?

117
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,557
Face it, jerkface,
it doesn't matter what you do,

118
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,234
I'll always be sexier than you,
better looking and more charming.

119
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,880
- Now, get your hand out of my ass.
- Shut up, Christian!

120
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,552
Shut up, Ralphy!

121
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,753
So, Doc, you gonna help Granddad out
or not?

122
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,670
I have an opening tomorrow at 11:00.

123
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,109
- He's gonna do me.
- That's great.

124
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,235
I know.

125
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,880
Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you.

126
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,992
It's not that anything's wrong, really,
it's just...

127
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,749
Well...

128
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,832
You can talk to me, Kimber.

129
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,393
Sex with Matt is kind of boring.

130
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,877
Kimber, you know as well as I do,
it's all about the tech.

131
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,115
The tech. I know. The tech works.

132
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,873
Have you two made a list
of your overts and withholds?

133
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,473
Overts and withholds?

134
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,795
Can I reach those with my vibrator?

135
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,792
When was the last time
this poor girl had an orgasm?

136
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,073
Am I boring you, Kimber?

137
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,151
No. No, of course not.

138
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,515
Jesus, girlfriend, what happened to you?

139
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,037
The highest grossing sex goddess of 2004
is trolling for sex tips?

140
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,997
Good com is at the core of a marriage.

141
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,640
And better communication
might not only help your sex life,

142
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,119
but also give you more energy.

143
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,760
Oh, my God, wake me when this is over!

144
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,399
Maybe I should come back
when you're more awake.

145
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,317
That's the guy from 75 trillion years ago
who drugged mankind

146
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,231
and nuked them in volcanoes.

147
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,710
What was his name? What's your name?

148
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,319
Xenu? Xenu.

149
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,430
I can't believe
you're falling for this bull, Kimmy.

150
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,956
There was nothing wrong
with who you were or who you used to be.

151
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,589
At least then, the only myth you
embraced was the one you created.

152
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,633
He kind of looks like that guy
we screwed in our first video, doesn't he?

153
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,357
Parker, wait a second, don't go yet.
I have a question.

154
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,839
Tell me about Xenu.

155
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,515
Like, what does he look like?
He's not the same as a Thetan, is he?

156
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,032
We don't talk about Xenu.

157
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,878
That's for OT Vll and higher.
People who are light enough to handle it.

158
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,399
Why don't you go lie down?
I'll call you later.

159
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,029
You'll never escape me, Kimmy.
Trying only makes you more tired.

160
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,431
- There's the fiancée I was looking for.
- Can you find me later, baby?

161
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,431
I'm late for a conference call
with Burt's lawyers.

162
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,399
- Some loose ends with the estate.
- I just wanted to give you this first.

163
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,712
Wilber drew it this morning.
He said it's of his new family.

164
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,950
I think he captured you quite well,
don't you think?

165
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,359
Oh, my goodness.

166
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,192
I'm gonna have this framed.

167
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,873
Hello, Christian.

168
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,952
Don't you mean, "Hello, asshole"?

169
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,793
There's no need
for demoralizing pet names anymore.

170
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,393
I'm here on business.

171
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,595
And how business-like of you

172
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,830
to sneak into my office
and take me by surprise.

173
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,955
I'm sorry.

174
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,554
It's the only way that I knew you'd see me.

175
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,279
I went by your apartment earlier,

176
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,237
but your doorman wouldn't tell me
where you'd moved.

177
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,231
Yeah, I always liked that guy.

178
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,679
How is he?

179
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,117
He's a little confused, not sleeping,
but good,

180
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,198
under the circumstances.

181
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,109
Look...

182
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,314
I figured you would've called by now
if you planned to get in touch.

183
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,632
Mr. Sutherland forbidding me to see
Wilber is one thing, but this is different.

184
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,911
I am his only living relative now.

185
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,594
You can't possibly think
of denying me my son.

186
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,352
It's in his will, Gina.

187
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,912
You lost any legal rights to Wilber
two years ago.

188
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,276
And with good reason.
But I am not that person anymore.

189
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,909
Look, I...

190
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,396
I made a nice nest egg
when I sold the spa.

191
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,870
And I renewed my real estate license
and I made quite a killing last year.

192
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,316
I am back at my S.A. meetings.
I'm even sponsoring newcomers.

193
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,679
How's your health?

194
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,835
Well, AIDS is the new diabetes, Christian.

195
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,913
And this cocktail I'm on,
I don't even get a cold during flu season.

196
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,196
Getting a new suit
and getting some money in the bank

197
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,350
doesn't really change who you are.

198
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,117
I tried to stay in his life.

199
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,988
I sent letters, I sent gifts every week.
They always got sent back.

200
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,799
Wilber's the only reason
I got my shit together.

201
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,710
I deserve to be his mother again.

202
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,871
He's as much my son, too.

203
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,957
- And I'm not handing him over again.
- I'm not asking for that.

204
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,273
No, no, all I'm asking for
is shared custody.

205
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,792
You're a great dad and...

206
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,319
Babies deserve
to have a mom in their life, too.

207
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,431
Legally, yes, I know I have no rights.

208
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,511
But I am here to ask you...

209
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,596
Will you please let me have
a relationship with my son again?

210
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,273
You all right?

211
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,828
Look how much paler my right hand is
than my left hand.

212
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,229
I don't think I've spent more than
20 minutes at a time

213
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,993
for the past 30 years without Ralphy on it.

214
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,433
You don't sleep with that thing do you?

215
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,397
No. I'm not nuts.

216
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,629
But his bed is right next to mine.

217
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,072
You're sure he's gonna be safe
in your office? Nobody's gonna take him?

218
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,149
Who would want him?

219
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,117
Fifteen minutes alone with him
and they'd pay you a ransom

220
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,838
to take him back.

221
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,272
Look, Doctor,
I know how crazy all this sounds.

222
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,749
Me competing
with a handsome block of Styrofoam

223
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,159
when I'm the one with the talent.

224
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,879
It's pure projection, I realize that,

225
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,834
but thank you.

226
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,713
You know, for letting me.

227
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,828
Pickups.

228
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,239
You need to call me back, Liz.
We need to talk.

229
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,913
We have talked, Poppy.

230
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,355
We talked, then we cried,
then we made love,

231
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,674
then we talked and cried some more

232
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,036
and none of it has made me feel any better
about the way you treat me.

233
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,032
- I'm sorry, we're in the middle of...
- I'm not in the sterile zone, Sean.

234
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,838
I know. I'm sorry, baby.

235
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,672
But don't let the fact
that I can't love myself

236
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,035
get in the way of letting me love you.

237
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,594
You are the most beautiful woman
that I have ever kissed

238
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,069
who didn't steal
one of my organs afterward,

239
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,596
but I cannot let you
keep me down anymore.

240
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,114
- But I love you.
- You love controlling me.

241
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,275
- Liz...
- Now you're not sterile, Poppy.

242
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,795
Go.

243
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,231
- Take my hand.
- Why?

244
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,595
To keep me from running out after her.

245
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,630
I didn't know you two had broken up.
How's it going?

246
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,511
Good days, bad days.

247
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,878
I miss her in bed with me.

248
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,757
That girl could miss a shower for a week
and still smell like lilacs.

249
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,158
Still, it feels right.

250
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,591
I just never felt good enough
when I was with her, you know?

251
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,719
Because no matter how many times
she told me she loved me, I never felt like

252
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,870
I could shine when she was around.

253
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,751
I know exactly how you feel.

254
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,034
Fifteen thousand shares. Yes.

255
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,635
- You know what this is? This is a kidney.
- I have to call you back.

256
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,429
How did you get in here?

257
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,431
Well, the maid let me in
without a struggle,

258
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,988
once I told her
I was Wilber's Auntie James.

259
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,472
You really should fire the fat slug.

260
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,233
I asked for an iced tea 20 minutes ago.

261
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,231
Put the child down, Michelle.

262
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,437
I've just bought Wilber a board game.
You're ruining all our fun.

263
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,717
I want you off my property
and out of my life.

264
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,994
Well, you are my life,
the sweetest part of it.

265
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,117
Don't deny me
the chance to share in your joy.

266
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,838
I've had so little of it.

267
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,798
- Just let me hold him.
- Stay away from him, James!

268
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,953
If you so much as breathe in his direction,
I swear to God, I will kill you.

269
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,239
Congratulations, Michelle.
Well, he's a fine-looking boy.

270
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,630
Adopted children often come
with all sorts of health issues.

271
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,590
But he looks positively robust.
Plump and juicy.

272
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,875
Matt?

273
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,428
- What's going on? Everything all right?
- Everything's fine, Dad, yeah.

274
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,478
Well, let me grab my jacket.
I'm free until 2:30. I'll take you to lunch.

275
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,199
Well, actually, I'm here to talk to Christian.

276
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,518
I thought you weren't speaking to him.

277
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,797
Yeah, I'm not,
but it's kind of an emergency.

278
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,349
Try me.

279
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,116
I'm your father, too, you know.

280
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,036
Kimber and I are...

281
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,275
We're having problems in the bedroom.

282
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,589
Jesus.

283
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,798
Christian's not the only sexpert
around here, Matt.

284
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,832
What sort of problems you having?

285
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,478
Premature ejaculation?

286
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,228
- Can we go into your office, please?
- Yeah.

287
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,591
You're not having E.D.
at your age, are you?

288
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,511
- E.D.?
- Erectile dysfunction.

289
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,794
Oh, Jesus, no.

290
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,476
I think we have the original mold
of the Kimber doll's vagina in storage.

291
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,835
Now, I can get it
and show you the sensitive areas.

292
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,639
No, I know where her clitoris is, Dad.

293
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,110
Sometimes straight vaginal intercourse

294
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,272
won't be enough for her
to reach full arousal.

295
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,749
Have you tried digital or oral stimulation?

296
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,910
See, that's why I wanted to talk to
Christian instead of you.

297
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,353
He can't tell you anything that I can't.

298
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,759
Well, he can tell me how to make her hot.

299
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,116
You make me feel like I'm talking
to Dr. Ruth. It's totally embarrassing.

300
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,394
Okay, fine.

301
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,874
You wanna make Kimber hot? I get it.

302
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,196
She's a former porn star.
You have to be assertive, be a man.

303
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,671
When she says she wants you to give it
to her in the rear, and believe me,

304
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,275
Kimber will say that,
you tease her first with your tongue.

305
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,590
She'll beg you to stick it in, but hold off.

306
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,036
Wait until she writhes and screams
until she can't take it anymore.

307
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,758
Only then do you give her what she wants.

308
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,990
You pound her so hard
she'll beg for mercy.

309
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,117
The neighbors will either move out
or send you flowers.

310
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,392
That's what I did with her.

311
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,919
What I'd do.

312
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,315
Well, if that's what you did with her...

313
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,750
I can't imagine
what Christian and Kimber did together.

314
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,277
- And you're sure this is what you want?
- More than sure.

315
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,637
Spending time with him,
holding him these past few days,

316
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,756
I just suddenly realized that I'd do
anything to protect him, keep him safe.

317
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,717
He stole my heart, Christian.

318
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,714
Making him legally mine feels like
the most natural thing in the world.

319
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,679
And you know that what I want most
in the world is for you to be his mommy.

320
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,471
And how about you, little man?

321
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,110
He's tired, but I think that's a yes.

322
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,229
Thank you.

323
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,833
I guess I'm a mom now.

324
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,997
- To family.
- To family.

325
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,034
To our family.

326
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,391
Our family. Let's toast.

327
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,070
- Cheers.
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

328
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,435
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God, Wilber. Wilber, hi.

329
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,158
What the hell are you doing here?
Did you follow us?

330
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,232
My lawyer informed me this afternoon
that you denied my request for visitation.

331
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,958
What the hell else am I supposed to do?

332
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,156
Wilber, sweetie, hi.
Can Mommy get a hug?

333
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,232
- Stop it, you're scaring him.
- Who the hell are you?

334
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,630
This is Michelle. Michelle, this is Gina.
Michelle is my fiancée.

335
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,836
- And Wilber's adoptive mother.
- His what?

336
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,832
We're getting married.
I asked her to legally adopt him.

337
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,070
- Is that what this celebration is about?
- Yes, it is, actually.

338
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,991
She's signing the paperwork?

339
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,872
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing, bitch?

340
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,871
All right, let's take this outside.
Come on. Come on.

341
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,473
This is so like you.
You're all about appearances.

342
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,232
What, you think that Wilber's
gonna be more comfortable

343
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,435
with her just because she's black?

344
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,592
Jesus Christ! If you don't take control
of yourself I won't speak to you at all.

345
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,113
Oh, no, I am done talking.

346
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,839
I tried that when I came by your office.
I wanted to play nice.

347
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,672
But if you want to play
"keep away from me,"

348
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,795
things are just gonna get ugly.

349
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,598
Come with me, Wilber.
Come with Mommy.

350
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,795
No.

351
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,069
Gina, Jesus!

352
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,310
Yeah, try to touch me again,
you'll wear your dessert!

353
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,311
What are you crazy, you bitch?
What the hell are you doing?

354
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,755
What, because I wanna see my son
after losing him for three years?

355
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,274
That makes me crazy?
You're the one who's lost your mind!

356
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,999
He is my son!
I am never gonna stop fighting for him!

357
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,308
- Never!
- Excuse me.

358
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,358
- Do I need to call the police?
- Yes, call the police.

359
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,995
I just wanted a hug, God damn it.

360
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,108
Wilber...

361
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,272
Mommy's gonna come back.

362
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,959
You can count on it.

363
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,955
Matt?

364
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,670
I could use a touch assist.

365
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,068
I'm miserable and I'm bloated.

366
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,155
Yeah, just focus them all right
here on the bed,

367
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,470
- that's where the star is, yeah?
- Matt?

368
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,309
Hey, baby.

369
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,199
- Got a little surprise for you.
- What's going on?

370
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,070
You and I are gonna make a porno.

371
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,832
You said how you always had
real orgasms on the set,

372
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,717
that's why you were such a big seller.

373
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,631
So we're gonna do one right here.

374
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,359
What are you thinking?
Those days for me are completely over.

375
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,432
- It's just for us, babe. It's just for us.
- No.

376
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,034
Look, and chances are
we're gonna be watching it repeatedly,

377
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,680
so I just wanted the quality
to be fantastic.

378
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,631
And look who I got to direct us.

379
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,275
- Hey, you.
- Lena?

380
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,192
How did you... Hi.

381
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,669
Oh, my God.

382
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,879
How are you?

383
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,709
Wow.

384
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,235
- This woman was my mentor.
- Yeah, I know, that's why she's here.

385
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,356
But, you guys, I can't do this.

386
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,190
Well, why not, lovey? Oh, it'll be fun.
You and me together again.

387
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,750
You remember our first film?
Starsky and Snatch?

388
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,190
- Oh, God, you were so insanely hot.
- Yeah, I bet you were.

389
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,273
It's all gone to shit now, though.
Nobody wants artistic porn anymore.

390
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,638
All they want is niche crap:
bondage, bukkake, bestiality.

391
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,631
Well, I got out just in time.

392
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,991
Well, your young man here
has gone way out on a limb.

393
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,913
He even brought in Marty.
Do you remember Marty?

394
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,036
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Marty.

395
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,913
You are a bad, bad boy.

396
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,195
- Hi, Marty.
- Isn't that what you want?

397
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,556
And wait till you hear
the story we've dreamed up.

398
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,157
You guys, I'm four months pregnant
and I'm huge.

399
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,472
Sweetheart, you are beyond luscious.

400
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,472
And action!

401
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,879
Oh, Doctor.

402
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,036
I'm burning up and you're the only
gynecologist who'll make house calls.

403
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,395
Oh, my. Well, then,
we must take your temperature.

404
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,595
Yeah.

405
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,555
Don't block the money shot, Matt!

406
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,673
Your fever's so high it's making me hot.

407
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,833
Is your husband home?

408
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,153
No, Doctor, he's away doing boys' things.

409
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,557
I need a real man who can take care of me.

410
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,918
Well, he's right here.

411
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,876
Oh, Doctor!

412
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,470
Yeah. Doctor.

413
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,679
Oh, Doctor! Oh, yeah!

414
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,558
Oh, that's right, baby, do it for Mama.

415
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,914
Yeah, harder!

416
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,709
Yeah!

417
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,837
There won't be any scarring
after the sutures come out.

418
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,628
So, is it what you expected?

419
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,709
It's better.

420
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,671
Doc, I didn't know how thirsty I was
till you gave me a drink.

421
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,991
It hurts like hell, but I feel so liberated.

422
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,072
Hey! Hey! How about
letting me out of here right now?

423
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,275
Let me out!

424
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,515
I didn't wanna show Ralphy yet.

425
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,160
He's been waiting there all day.
Could you get Ralphy out please?

426
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,798
Could you go get him for me, Doc?

427
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,952
All right, hey, what are you doing?
Let me out. I wanna take a look.

428
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,474
Hey, let me out of here right now.
What are you doing?

429
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,916
Okay, could you cover his eyes, Doc?
I wanna show him myself.

430
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,194
Ralphy, wait'll you see this.

431
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,316
- I wanna see.
- Hang on, hang on. Hang on, hang on.

432
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,833
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah. Ready.

433
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,319
Okay, look.

434
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,389
Well?

435
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:22,194
Jesus, Mary, son of Joseph, did you use
a scalpel or a sledgehammer, Doc?

436
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,679
Oh, come on, Ralphy.

437
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,593
I'm serious. He should lose his license
after this hack-job.

438
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,113
Why can't you be there for me?

439
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,794
Can't you just let me be happy
for five minutes, just once?

440
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,838
You want me to lie? Okay.
You look like Monty Clift.

441
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,758
Not when he was alive, mind you.

442
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,308
Mr. Ward, it's a puppet. Just put it down.

443
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,188
He can't, Doc.

444
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,310
Without me he's 176 pounds of nothing.

445
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,952
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

446
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,272
- How much longer you wanna stay?
- I don't know, an hour or so.

447
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,874
It's good for him. Gets all his energy out.

448
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,838
He's not the only one.

449
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,110
Why don't you go home?
We'll catch up with you.

450
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,156
You can get yourself some rest.

451
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,274
What about the 7:30 reservation?
Do you not want to go to dinner now?

452
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,633
Should we order in?

453
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,636
Can you watch him for a sec?
I'll be back in a minute, buddy.

454
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,033
What in the hell are you doing here,
God damn it?

455
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,634
I'm sorry.
I thought you were somebody else.

456
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,759
Can I push the baby?

457
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,837
- Sure, honey. But not too high, okay?
- I promise.

458
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,239
Guess I'm a little paranoid.

459
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,309
And I know what you're thinking,

460
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,868
but everything's gonna be different
once the adoption is formal.

461
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,837
We're gonna be... We're gonna be fine.

462
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,798
We need to hire a security firm
to watch the house.

463
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,075
And I want to put a restraining order
against her.

464
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,993
No, no, no, I don't wanna do that.
Not to Gina. Not yet.

465
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,310
Why are you always giving this woman
the benefit of the doubt?

466
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,435
Because she's had a hard life.

467
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,717
And, I don't know, I just... I guess I feel
like she's gonna change at some point.

468
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,429
You know what? If he were my son,
I'd be stalking him everywhere, too.

469
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,999
She's not gonna go away.

470
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,231
That's just something
that we're gonna have to deal with.

471
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,510
- Christian?
- Where's Wilber?

472
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,189
Wilber?

473
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,435
Hey, the little boy you were pushing,
where is he?

474
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,353
- He went with the lady.
- What lady? Where did she take him?

475
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,829
I don't know.
Was he not supposed to leave with her?

476
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,797
- Wilber?
- Wilber!

477
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,749
Wilber?

478
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,029
Wilber!

479
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,068
Yeah.

480
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,030
Oh, Dr. Schwartz.

481
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,754
You know just where to touch me.

482
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:33,356
I think we need to use my schwartz
to examine you more closely.

483
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,592
I shall now remove it from my trousers.

484
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,751
Lock the door. Go lock the door.

485
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,272
- Take off the loupes, son.
- Yes, sir.

486
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,998
Hi, Dr. Schwartz.

487
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,877
- How we feeling today, Kimber?
- Fine.

488
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,633
I gained four pounds,
which I don't like, but good...

489
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,836
You could afford to gain
a few more, actually.

490
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,319
The baby needs nourishment.

491
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,870
Well, I'll make sure to give her
a second helping at every meal.

492
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,750
Now, before we start,
I'd like to talk about the Second Dynamic.

493
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,753
The Second Dynamic?

494
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,990
- The part about creativity.
- Oh, right.

495
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,117
Actually, it's about sex and family,

496
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,997
and surviving through future generations

497
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,038
by making sure engrams
aren't implanted on the fetus.

498
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,873
But I would never do anything
to hurt the baby, Dr. Schwartz.

499
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,520
- We're very, very careful.
- Are you?

500
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,317
Do you know that aggressive sex
during pregnancy

501
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,516
can be interpreted by the fetus as abuse,

502
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,750
possibly even an attempted abortion?

503
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,189
Don't you think that's an engram?

504
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,679
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about?

505
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,799
I'm talking about your obscene little
"playing doctor," pregnancy-fetish movie

506
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,110
on someone named
Lena Werkman's website.

507
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,316
It was discovered
by a Church member this morning.

508
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,958
That must be a mistake.

509
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:51,033
'Cause she is a friend of ours
and she would never do that.

510
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,033
- Oh, shit.
- Your ethics are out.

511
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,396
Even after you do the work to fix this,
the damage might already be done.

512
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,109
I fear for your child's future
and for your future in the Church.

513
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,711
Now, let's get started, shall we?
Why don't you lie back?

514
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,115
Hello?

515
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,031
The police are sending a car
over to Gina's apartment.

516
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,395
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- She's desperate, Christian.

517
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,994
She'll do anything to hurt us.
You don't understand.

518
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,877
You need to stay calm, sweetheart.
One of us has to.

519
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,313
They'll find him.

520
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,912
This is my fault, Christian.
I brought this on him.

521
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,195
- This is my fault.
- This is nobody's fault.

522
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,636
We're gonna get through this.
They're gonna find Wilber. Okay?

523
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,393
I love you.

524
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,239
I love you, too.

525
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,991
Looking for this, Michelle?

526
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,188
I don't think
you'll find one of Burt's guns in the desk.

527
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,158
You did such a magnificent job
baby-proofing the place.

528
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,118
Where is he, James?
What have you done with Wilber?

529
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:08,395
Children that age are so extraordinary,
aren't they?

530
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,189
- So pure, so full of light.
- Give him back, God damn you!

531
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,590
He's innocent.
He doesn't deserve to suffer.

532
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,954
Do any of us?

533
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,913
I had a little boy.

534
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,078
Did I tell you that? I don't think I did.

535
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,989
Jonathan.

536
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,188
He had the same bright sparkle
in his eyes.

537
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,710
He inherited a defective gene,

538
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,395
and his kidneys developed sacs of fluid
that consumed the healthy tissue.

539
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,473
He was 18 months when he died
in my arms waiting for a young donor.

540
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,598
That tragedy has led me
to my current business.

541
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,633
It's ironic, isn't it?

542
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:58,636
So, you think your child's death
justifies taking another child's life?

543
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,917
Children's organs are in high demand.
It seemed all right somehow

544
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,719
to deprive you of the happiness
I can't have,

545
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:09,828
to make you just taste
the misery that has become my life.

546
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,751
Misery so powerful
it can make you do things,

547
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,957
things you never believed yourself
capable of.

548
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,034
Oh, my God... Wilber. Oh, my God.

549
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,758
Shocking to me,
when it first occurred to me.

550
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,594
A drunk is one thing, but a helpless child?

551
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,513
You were right when you said,
"There is nothing human left in me! "

552
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,908
Can you imagine to take revenge
on something that you've never had,

553
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,560
that you could never have,
on a defenseless child?

554
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,393
James, don't! Please! Please, don't!

555
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,357
When you reach that point,

556
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,272
there's just nothing left to lose,
is there, darling?

557
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,518
- I loved you!
- Please stop, James!

558
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,555
Hello?

559
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,871
I have Wilber. He's fine.

560
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,359
We'll be home in a half an hour.

561
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,111
He didn't even know me.
He was afraid of me.

562
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,475
Imagine your own child rejecting you.

563
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,398
He cried the whole time.

564
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,672
I've worked too hard to get where I am.

565
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,194
Turning him from a whiny brat
into a decent little boy

566
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,033
would take all my time
and an entire team of experts.

567
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,076
That is not how I plan
to spend my time or money.

568
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,197
Undoing the Sutherlands' mess? No.
Be my guest.

569
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,869
- Are you done?
- He's got quite the potty mouth.

570
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,474
- Good luck with that.
- Must be in the genes.

571
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,512
Well, time's up,
which means it's time for you to leave.

572
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,477
And I'll be pressing charges.

573
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,874
I thought I wanted him.
That's all I thought about for three years.

574
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,271
My mother wasn't a bad person.

575
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,990
She loved me, she took care of me.

576
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,669
I don't know why I turned out like this.

577
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,358
Yeah, I guess it's random.

578
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,037
Some people get the parenting instinct,
some people don't.

579
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,232
You've got that instinct.

580
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,713
You. The asshole.

581
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,715
Go figure.

582
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,115
Hey.

583
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,237
Don't forget your fire truck.

584
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,913
Well, I had to buy it for him.

585
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,991
He screamed so loud
the whole store was staring at me

586
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,798
like I was Attila the Hun.

587
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,790
- Bye, kiddo.
- Bye.

588
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,594
Be a good boy.

589
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,115
You, too.

590
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,228
Hey, there, buddy. Come on up here.

591
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,789
Come on, give... Give your daddy a hug.

592
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,075
We had to get a Hazmat crew in
to clean up all the blood.

593
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,037
It was disgusting. It was everywhere.
You should've seen.

594
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,314
It was on the walls, on the furniture...

595
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,958
Can we not talk about this, please?

596
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,190
No, I think we do need to talk about this.

597
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,430
You knew she was Michelle's madam?

598
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,476
She was in our recovery suite, Christian.

599
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,518
- How could you not tell me?
- 'Cause I asked him not to.

600
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,398
James was my shame, Sean.

601
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,358
I'm sorry if I didn't want it
whispered through the halls.

602
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,159
Then explain to me
why you're planning your shame's funeral?

603
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,878
Because I'm all she had.

604
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,794
And how do you explain
not telling me about Wilber?

605
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,678
It feels like
you're cutting me out of everything.

606
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,990
Because we didn't want you to worry.

607
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,479
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about
everything, but Wilber's fine. He's safe.

608
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,149
And James is dead.

609
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,913
And, as far as I'm concerned,
Michelle's past went with her.

610
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,231
So now we all just have to move on.

611
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,555
Yeah?

612
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,389
Yeah.

613
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,229
Everything is falling into place
for me, partner.

614
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,595
The business, Michelle, Wilber.

615
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,597
It's funny, every day of my life I wake
up with this thing in my throat.

616
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:10,477
But this morning,
when little Wilber snuck in

617
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,400
and wedged himself
between Michelle and me,

618
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,950
I just laid there listening
to the two of them breathing.

619
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:21,990
And that thing in my throat,
whatever it is, disappeared.

620
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,075
I want you and Michelle to buy me out.

621
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,195
What? I was just telling you
how good everything's going.

622
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,429
For you.

623
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,990
That thing in your throat that went
away when you got a family?

624
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,548
I swallowed it
when mine left for New York.

625
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,476
You've been through this before.

626
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,437
How many times
have you tried to leave this place?

627
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,509
You just need a vacation.

628
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,589
Why don't you go to Sardinia,

629
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,990
screw some hot Italian bitch
with hairy armpits, and you'll be fine.

630
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,071
I put the house on the market yesterday.

631
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,434
Julia's on board.

632
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,398
She said
there's nothing left for her there either.

633
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,116
I've been blaming you
for my unhappiness for years.

634
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,279
First with Julia,
then the business, then Matt.

635
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,388
You know how I'm always
being critical of your lifestyle?

636
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,438
I've realized
it's just been a cover for my jealousy.

637
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,719
I'm in awe of you.

638
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,873
I always have been.

639
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,472
Well, I feel the same way about you,
so why break up the team?

640
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,074
Because you and I have been friends
and partners for so long,

641
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,230
I don't know who I am without you.

642
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,518
I need to find that out.

643
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,509
- Where you gonna go?
- I don't know.

644
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,953
Just out of Miami.

645
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,390
There are plenty of cities
that need a good plastic surgeon.

646
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,111
You know I'll sue you first?

647
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,311
I couldn't be happier for you.

648
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,198
But I am going. It's done.

649
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,833
Relax, Ms. Landau,
I'm not going to hurt you.

650
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,631
- How do you know my name?
- What? You don't know who I am?

651
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,630
I never get the credit I deserve.

652
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,512
I'm Escobar Gallardo.

653
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,349
I'm the reason you met your new fiancé.

654
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,916
Your boss James worked for me.

655
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:27,756
And now that she's gone,
you're gonna take her place.

656
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,599
Please drive.

657
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,349
English
