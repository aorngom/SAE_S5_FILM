00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,790
<i>Previously on Nip / Tuck:</i>

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,996
As you can see,
here is the cautery tip...

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,674
you left inside my client's stomach
after her tummy tuck.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,677
What kind of reparations
are you looking for?

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,195
From now on,
no matter what the operation...

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,793
there'll be no charge.

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,030
Why couldn't you just love me?

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,474
I've never loved anyone.

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,710
Christian Troy, James Sutherland.

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,789
Wilber's father. His real one.

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,153
All right, you are now
officially a prune...

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,198
and it is way past your bedtime.

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,312
What's this, honey? Is this blood?

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,438
It's a mosquito bite.

15
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,510
I thought the ibuprofen
was in the kitchen.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,878
Honey, maybe Daddy would like to see
your mosquito bite.

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,034
My baby's got a bite?

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,397
There's some blood
on her underwear. Some spotting.

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,559
How did the mosquito
get in your underwear, honey?

20
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,034
- I forgot. They're Torie's underwear.
- Who's Torie?

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,351
Suzanne Epstein's daughter.
They're in school together.

22
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,468
Sweetheart, these are your underwear.
We bought them together, remember?

23
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,279
Right.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,310
- Is something wrong?
- No, sweetheart.

25
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,917
It's just that you're starting puberty.

26
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,438
What's puberty?

27
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,189
Lunchtime lipo on a high-school senior.
Amazing.

28
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,830
Nobody wants
a rah-rah girl with cellulite.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,231
The patient's aiming
for a cheerleading scholarship at USF.

30
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,313
Unfortunately, we live in a world
where smooth thighs matter.

31
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,711
We should start offering liposuction
to overweight newborns.

32
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,599
Get those tubby 10-pounders
started off right.

33
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,758
That was a joke, fellas.

34
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,629
You both look like someone
stole your firstborn.

35
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,677
Well, they're certainly trying.

36
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,395
Gina tracked down
Wilber's biological father.

37
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,758
A blood test
confirmed paternity...

38
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,549
and now he's decided to align himself
with her in the custody hearing.

39
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,351
Two biological parents
is a pretty stacked deck, Christian.

40
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,871
A drunken
happy-hour hookup...

41
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,112
does not give this guy
any moral advantage over me, Sean.

42
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,239
Biological or not,
Wilber's my son.

43
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,752
I was just trying to make a point
that biological realities...

44
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,354
are pretty difficult to dispute.

45
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,159
Case in point,
Annie started premenstrual spotting.

46
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,670
Annie's eight.
She's too young for puberty.

47
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,150
Not with the bovine growth
hormones in meat and milk products.

48
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,231
We looked it up online this morning.

49
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,469
Jesus.

50
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,674
I was supposed to have 15 years
to prepare myself...

51
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,910
for my little girl becoming a woman.

52
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,434
She's barely out
of pajamas with feet.

53
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,072
How did this happen?

54
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,313
Good job, gentlemen.

55
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,040
Our patient doesn't look a day over 13.

56
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,680
The girls love a good princess event.

57
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,035
Now, I have nine regular crowns...

58
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,955
and then, one special one
to crown our little Princess Menses.

59
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,439
Annie, in this case.

60
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,795
Suzanne, are you sure
the princess theme...

61
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,679
is the best way to introduce
puberty and menstruation...

62
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,638
This is my fourth
Princess Menses tea party, Julia.

63
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,313
Trust me, I know whereof I speak.

64
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,995
I just thought we'd take
a more empowering kind of approach.

65
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,878
Get off the high horse with me, Julia.

66
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,794
Last time you tried that, you and
your Pilates tranny got bucked big time.

67
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,032
Now, I am here to help out
because Annie and Torie are friends...

68
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,191
not because I value your opinions.

69
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,316
Sweetie, I think you need contacts.

70
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,278
You must be legally blind not to notice
how good my skin is looking these days.

71
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,919
I'm sorry, Suzanne.

72
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,594
I just assumed you'd got shot up again
with BOTOX.

73
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,234
I cancelled my standing
BOTOX appointment...

74
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,914
once I discovered flax seed oil.

75
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,995
Reverses the aging process.

76
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,795
Torie's hormonal horror
was a secret mitzvah for me.

77
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,068
We switched from hormone-laced meats
and dairies to all organic foods...

78
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,669
and now suddenly,
I look 10 years younger.

79
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,475
And this, anti-aging diet really works?
For the whole family, I mean?

80
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,553
Healthy food is the new plastic surgery.
Who knew?

81
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,471
Tell me what you don't like
about yourself today, Mrs. Grubman.

82
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,671
- My knees.
- Your knees?

83
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,152
Thanks to scrupulous due diligence, I have
the face and body of a woman half my age.

84
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,799
My knees give me away.

85
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,918
They're bony,
and they sag like a couch in a crack den.

86
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,672
If you'd like to tone the vastus medialis,
Mrs. Grubman...

87
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,991
- I could recommend some exercises.
- Please. Who has time to exercise?

88
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,720
You'll do a touch of a lipo
to smooth out the dimpling...

89
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,031
thin the bone and then plump it all out
with some collagen.

90
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,512
Well, don't just sit there.
Pull out the appointment book.

91
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,719
Do you lie awake at night
dreaming up ways to torture your body...

92
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,393
and us, Mrs. Grubman?

93
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,034
Spare me the moralistic lecture, Dr. Troy.

94
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,349
If I were paying...

95
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,910
you'd have me on the books
faster than shit goes through a goose.

96
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,512
You've had 10 procedures
in the last six months.

97
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,558
- It's upkeep.
- At this point, it's paleontology.

98
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,673
Mrs. Grubman, you have
a plastic surgery addiction problem.

99
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,711
Consider this your intervention.

100
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,189
Open that book and schedule me
right now, Dr. Troy...

101
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,113
or I'll tell the world
you left an instrument in my stomach...

102
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,838
during my tummy tuck last year.

103
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,470
Mrs. Grubman, the threats need to stop.

104
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,995
Do not underestimate my wrath, fellas.

105
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,596
Or we will have no choice
but to leak this appointment book...

106
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,150
and all the macabre, sad operations...

107
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,232
that you've literally forced us to do,
at knifepoint...

108
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,393
<i>to Women's Wear Daily.</i>

109
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,151
I need that knee lift.

110
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,114
I do not want to give up
wearing miniskirts.

111
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,717
Not now. Not this season.

112
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,677
Mrs. Grubman, I apologize
if our tough-love approach here...

113
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,831
was too tough.

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,310
But, honestly, we're just looking out
for your best interests.

115
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,558
That's not why I'm crying.

116
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,552
My daughter has cancer.

117
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,830
Thirty years old,
and she has stage three breast cancer.

118
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,037
- It's in the lymph nodes.
- Mrs. Grubman, I'm so sorry.

119
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,873
I asked the oncologist,
"How could this be?"

120
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,954
Grandmothers get cancer, not daughters.

121
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,672
He said he didn't know why.

122
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,634
She lives under power lines.

123
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,076
She takes birth control pills.
She's always on her cell phone.

124
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,873
You ever noticed how everything...

125
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,838
that's supposed to improve our lives
is killing us?

126
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,718
<i>And me. I've had my good years.</i>

127
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,196
But my daughter is a single mother.

128
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,430
Who's going to raise little Isabella?

129
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,793
Not the worthless turd
who ran out on them.

130
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,353
That leaves me.

131
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,315
Oh, God.

132
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,914
Can you imagine me raising a 4-year-old?

133
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,030
I'm too goddamn old to start over.

134
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,718
I mean I'm 45.

135
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,192
Mrs. Grubman, under the circumstances,
don't you think...

136
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,479
this perhaps, could be
a less than desirable time...

137
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,198
to schedule cosmetic surgery?

138
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,157
On the contrary, Dr. Troy.

139
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,313
We are facing a mastectomy,
chemo, hair loss...

140
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,358
and I say "we"...

141
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,438
because she's not that strong.
I spoiled her rotten.

142
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,590
So call me shallow. Call me pathetic.

143
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,751
But beauty is my strength and my armor.

144
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,639
And I owe it to my girl
to look like a million goddamn bucks.

145
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,474
That's how we're going
to get through this.

146
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,833
How's Thursday at 7:00?

147
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,829
We need to talk.

148
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,389
My lawyer has advised me
not to talk to you.

149
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,471
How about if I do the talking?

150
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,798
Gina's had 292 sexual partners
in the last three years.

151
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,830
She's not fit to be this baby's mother.

152
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,112
You went through her diary.

153
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,917
- James, that's not very nice.
- She left the damn thing out.

154
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,198
I can't leave a defenseless child
with this lady.

155
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,311
You're taking him back to Arizona?

156
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,079
Listen, Christian.

157
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,192
I've tried to imagine the conversation
with my wife...

158
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,318
where I tell her
that after 39 years of marriage...

159
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,151
I had a one-night stand,
and now we must raise another child.

160
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,074
I don't see that conversation taking place.

161
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,950
You love this baby.

162
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,117
<i>You should raise him.</i>

163
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,756
I'd like to help you get custody.

164
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,036
- May I?
- Yes.

165
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,474
I missed you so much. I did.

166
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,153
You want to help me get custody
of this baby, James?

167
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,275
- Get me the diary.
- I can do that.

168
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,391
There's something else you need to know.

169
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,996
She's calling character witnesses
to discredit your reputation.

170
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,709
What are you getting at?
Someone from your past.

171
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,756
A blonde lady
with a disturbing story about a knife.

172
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,519
<i>Ring a bell?</i>

173
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,349
Kimber. Her name is Kimber.

174
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,911
Annie McNamara, we crown you...

175
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,352
Princess Menses.

176
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,755
You are now part of a very special club.

177
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,437
Thanks, Mrs. Epstein.

178
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,994
Okay, royal ones...

179
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,311
now that we've learned about the changes
your body will go through...

180
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,630
I'm going to tell you a little story.

181
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,789
Daddy!

182
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,951
Hey!

183
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,554
I decided this was something I had to see.

184
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,752
- That all right?
- We're thrilled, aren't we, girls?

185
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,229
Excuse me, Julia.

186
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,312
There's never been a male
at a Princess Menses tea before.

187
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,755
Well, I'm her prince.

188
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,839
Yeah. Daddy can be my prince,
Mrs. Epstein.

189
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,752
Ready for the story, girls?

190
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,397
Once upon a time,
in the kingdom of Menses...

191
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,199
a princess was playing
with her handmaidens.

192
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,590
<i>She had just begun menstruating...</i>

193
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,594
and she was showing them
how to use a tampon and a pad...

194
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,757
just like we learned today.

195
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,790
A prince just happened to pass by,
and he thought to himself:

196
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,037
"This princess is so totally hot!"

197
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,838
And he went up to her and said,
"Hey, baby, I'm a prince. Let's hang. "

198
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,071
<i>It's Christian. Confirming lunch today.</i>

199
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,669
<i>I'm really looking forward
to seeing you again.</i>

200
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,071
<i>But the prince was really a wolf.</i>

201
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,713
The princess didn't care.

202
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,839
She put on a cute little outfit
and off she went to meet the prince.

203
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,952
The prince told her
she looked totally dope...

204
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,236
and led her to his crib.

205
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,911
Where is she taking this?

206
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,915
"Take off your clothes, Princess,"
said the prince.

207
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,239
Pressed up against him,
the princess felt a hard bulge.

208
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,039
And the princess replied:

209
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,431
"Do you know what?
You're a wolf, not a prince. "

210
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,236
"And I don't play with liars.
So there, wolfie. "

211
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,279
And then they all played Monopoly
and lived happily ever after.

212
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,474
Juice and
gluten-free cookies on the table.

213
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,270
Suzanne, that was totally over the top.

214
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,476
We were doing just fine
until you walked in.

215
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,269
Your presence made the girls
uncomfortable, and I knew that it would.

216
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,670
Suzanne, I think I speak
for Julia and myself...

217
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,435
when I tell you I don't want my 8-year-old
knowing graphic sexual intimacies.

218
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,309
I get it. You want your baby
to stay innocent for as long as she can.

219
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,118
Yes. We do.

220
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,308
News flash, Julia. Those little angels
are dripping with hormones.

221
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,516
If you don't think
the older boys can smell it...

222
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,195
then you and your daughter
are in for a very rude awakening.

223
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,359
Why are you fighting?

224
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,675
Good to see you.

225
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,150
Cut the crap, Christian.
I know why you wanted to see me.

226
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,875
You invited me to lunch
so you could sweet-talk me...

227
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,952
into keeping my mouth shut
at your custody deposition.

228
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,591
That'll never happen.
I'm starving. Let's order.

229
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,639
When was the last time
you had a meal, sweetheart?

230
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,354
Have you been taking care of yourself?
You look a little...

231
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,715
My life couldn't be better, Christian.

232
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,433
What are you living on
since you and Merrill split the sheets?

233
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,670
That relationship
was totally holding me back.

234
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,910
I've been transitioning into acting.

235
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,838
It's so rewarding to do more
than stand there and pose.

236
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,516
Now I get to stand there and speak.

237
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,718
- Good for you.
- You're patronizing me?

238
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,269
You never did give me one ounce of credit.

239
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,599
I want to know what it's going to take
to get you on my side.

240
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,637
A goddamn miracle, for starters.

241
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,277
I can't lose Wilber, Kimber.
I love him too much.

242
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,552
You couldn't love anybody.
Your heart's made of granite.

243
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,670
You have every right to believe that.

244
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,479
But I am a different man now,
since I had a kid.

245
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,118
I look at him, Kimber, and I just...

246
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,273
I'm lost.

247
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,913
His love is so pure and unconditional.
It's like he's opened up my heart.

248
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,314
Why couldn't you
love me like that, Christian?

249
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,079
I was so good to you.

250
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,991
I could still be good for you.

251
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,515
Remember our sex together?
You said I was the best sex you ever had.

252
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,792
We could live together again.
We could try it again.

253
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,799
And when you're working,
I could be like your maid or something.

254
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,709
Can't you try and love me again?

255
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,035
No.

256
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,789
I have to be able to live with myself now.

257
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,033
I'm Wilber's father.

258
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,789
Excuse me.

259
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,395
Shit!

260
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,071
What took you so long?
Your straw get clogged?

261
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,196
The world isn't
on your time clock, Christian.

262
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,952
There was a line in the ladies' room.

263
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,590
- Several, I'm sure.
- You gave me a migraine.

264
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,638
Waiter. Could you get me
a glass of chardonnay?

265
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,871
Great. Chardonnay ought to put you
right back on track.

266
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,596
FYI, I met some movie producers
who think I'm the bomb...

267
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,399
and they can't wait to get into
the Kimber Henry business.

268
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,629
Jesus, Kimber.

269
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,109
You can take
your holier-than-thou bullshit...

270
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,918
and shove it up your ass, Christian.

271
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,198
I've decided to testify against you.
You're going to go down once and for all.

272
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,315
Oh, my God. What's going on?

273
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,319
Oh, my God.

274
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,235
Aduki beans purify the blood
and flush out toxins.

275
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,196
They also help strengthen
the female organs...

276
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,314
and according to Chinese folk wisdom...

277
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,558
the aduki bean
is considered a source of courage...

278
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,870
that helps people meet challenges bravely.

279
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,793
Yeah, but where do I get the courage
to take the first bite?

280
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,951
You're a big boy, Matt. Just do it.

281
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,033
You first, Dad.

282
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,078
It's quite tasty, Jules.

283
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,153
Okay, look, all I'm asking for is a week.

284
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,629
One week's commitment
to a new way of eating...

285
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,950
that will benefit all of us in the long run.

286
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,908
Annie, honey, what do you think?
I think this soup tastes gross.

287
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,590
- Maybe I added too much brewer's yeast.
- Brewer's yeast?

288
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,516
That's what people give their dogs.

289
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,711
Look, I'm making a grilled cheese.
Anyone else?

290
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,111
Your mother's gone through
a lot of trouble to prepare a healthy feast.

291
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,111
You're not making
a grilled cheese sandwich.

292
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,714
You're not making it
because there's no cheese.

293
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,792
Dairy products are loaded
with hormones these days...

294
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,316
just like our meat and our chicken.
Welcome to the 21st century.

295
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,959
Hijiki seaweed?

296
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,352
Umeboshi paste? Flax seed oil?

297
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,909
I'm sorry, but I should not have
to eat dog food...

298
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,799
because you're worried about
Little Princess Pubes over there.

299
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,996
Matt, sit down and eat your dinner.

300
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,274
Annie, under the heading of, "things Mom
might not remember to mention. "

301
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,998
- Don't wear white pants.
- Matt.

302
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,991
- Why not?
- Well...

303
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,669
there was this girl in the sixth grade,
Becky Sledick.

304
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,311
Becky was wearing white pants on the day
she got her first visit from Aunt Flow.

305
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,594
She had this big old blood stain
on her butt.

306
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,633
Becky Bull's Eye.
We call her that to this very day.

307
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,153
I don't want to get a stain.

308
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,118
- You're excused.
- No, stay. I want to talk to you.

309
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,998
Annie, go start your homework.
We'll check in a minute.

310
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,348
- What is going on with you?
- I'm sorry.

311
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,909
That's not good enough.
You're acting like an asshole.

312
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,753
Look, I just don't want
to eat weird shit for dinner, okay?

313
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,469
You both are so hypocritical, as if it's
her hormones you're worried about...

314
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,471
the truth is you're just being narcissists.

315
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,279
You're both just freaked out
about getting older yourselves.

316
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,634
Good night.

317
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,793
That was a success.

318
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,509
Tomorrow night, we'll have seaweed
and see what fun that unleashes.

319
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,235
- Maybe he needs to see a therapist.
- He needs to be told to shape up.

320
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,870
Sean, this has been going on
since that whole Henry thing.

321
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,756
I think he needs to talk to someone.

322
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,393
Maybe Ava. Maybe she could
help him to open up a little.

323
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,950
If she can teach him the difference
between acceptable and unacceptable...

324
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,998
ways of behaving toward one's family,
I'm all for it.

325
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,796
By the way, I'm wondering
if Matt wasn't the tiniest bit right.

326
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,796
Is the new regime
for little girls or big girls?

327
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,634
It's a good thing
you had these in your purse.

328
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,079
Tilt your head back.

329
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,118
Congratulations, Kimber.

330
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,632
Your little coke jag
has hollowed out your septum...

331
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,633
and eaten a good deal
of your nasal cartilage.

332
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,515
Speak English.

333
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,632
You got a hole in your nose
the size of a quarter, sweetheart.

334
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,360
It is not a pretty sight, nor are you.

335
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,313
You look like dog shit.
You know what?

336
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,119
People were talking shit to me
before the drugs.

337
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,830
I am too old.

338
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,996
Models are dinosaurs at 25.
Well, I'm an actress.

339
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,080
The older I get,
the more interesting I get.

340
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,791
- Sharon Stone was 32 before she hit it big.
- Sharon Stone also had a nose.

341
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,192
The sound of wind whistling through
her bombed-out nasal passages...

342
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,191
didn't distract the fans.

343
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,717
You're a drug addict, Kimber.

344
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,269
Keep on going like this,
and there'll be no career...

345
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,432
and no Prince Charming
to climb the trellis and save you.

346
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,158
What am I supposed to do?

347
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,832
I have no money. I have no insurance.

348
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,989
I'm screwed.

349
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,916
Then today's your lucky day, sweetheart.

350
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,595
Prince Charming is right here
and offering the deal of a lifetime.

351
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,755
I'll rebuild your septum, gratis...

352
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,274
and you tell Gina
you won't take the stand.

353
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,838
We'll both get our dreams.

354
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,315
Hair dye.

355
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,552
I read the darker colors
cause non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

356
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,675
Diet sodas.

357
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,434
Jules says they concentrate
formaldehyde in fat cells...

358
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,669
and prevent weight loss.

359
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,229
She's rocky.
Her blood pressure's all over the place.

360
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,310
What about surfing?

361
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,950
The ocean is full of toxic waste
which causes cancer.

362
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,510
The game is things people do
to stay young that make them old.

363
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,352
People surf to stay young.

364
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,152
After this operation...

365
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,675
Grubman is not going to be able
to walk for a month...

366
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,071
which means she can't help her daughter
when she needs her the most.

367
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,152
We are playing
into pure narcissism here.

368
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,754
We're surgeons, Liz.
Not shrinks.

369
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,230
Is she stabilizing?
I'm giving her 10 cc's of ephedrine.

370
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,598
Holy shit, she's in v-fib.
I'm getting the crash cart.

371
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,717
200 joules.
Charge to 200.

372
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,869
Clear.

373
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,157
Charge to 300.
Clear.

374
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,675
Come on.

375
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,871
Charge to 360.
360, charge.

376
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,871
Give me an amp of epi.
Clear.

377
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,669
300 milligrams
of amidodarone.

378
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,399
Come on. You're not going to
die on me, you crazy bitch.

379
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,589
What are we going to do if she dies, Sean?

380
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,759
Don't make out the death certificate yet.
We don't even know what happened.

381
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,592
I know what happened in there.

382
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,309
You two mutilating mercenaries
ought to have your licenses revoked.

383
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,679
You must be Claire. I'm Christian Troy.

384
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,957
Why didn't you say no?
She didn't need any more work done.

385
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,358
How could you indulge her?

386
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,875
Typical.

387
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,193
I get cancer,
and my own mother has to top me.

388
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,029
If there's an ounce of negligence
on your part, you will pay.

389
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,589
How is she?

390
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,354
She suffered a massive
intercerebral hemorrhage en route.

391
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,750
- Just tell me if she's going to make it.
- She is.

392
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,433
But she suffered some paralysis.

393
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,353
Her speech will probably
be slurred, so be prepared.

394
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,592
There's nothing
to cause increased blood pressure...

395
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,875
so we ordered tests.

396
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,998
- We're very thorough.
- I know, it's not your doctor's fault.

397
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,833
This would not have shown up
on the pre-op lab work.

398
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,514
But we found traces
of phenelzine in her blood.

399
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,831
MAO Inhibitors, they don't mix well
with anesthesia, as you know.

400
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,513
An antidepressant?

401
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,793
<i>She didn't list that on her chart
or during her pre-op interview.</i>

402
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,794
- Why would she keep that a secret?
- Because she just started taking them.

403
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,715
She felt a lot of shame about that.
It always comes down to vanity with her.

404
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,793
I imagine that she was trying to be strong,
so she could be there for you.

405
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,714
Not my mother.

406
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,318
She started the antidepressant
at least a month ago.

407
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,711
Way before my cancer earned me a spot
on her to-do list.

408
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,231
Have you got any idea
why she was depressed?

409
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,915
I would think that you could
diagnose that in your sleep, Doctors.

410
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,475
God knows you made a fortune off of it.

411
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,993
My mother was deeply depressed
about aging.

412
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,032
The perfect 10
looks like 10 miles of bad road.

413
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,193
What happened to her?

414
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,393
Time hasn't been
good to Kimber. Neither was I.

415
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,592
Come in.
Look, I just want to say I don't...

416
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,034
- What's going on?
- Your sister's not feeling well.

417
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,997
This is insane. They still have me on hold.

418
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,149
What's wrong with her?

419
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,311
I'm not sure what. Her fever's going up.

420
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,755
Julia, hand me that blanket. Sit up, honey.

421
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,070
We're gonna wrap her up,
and take her to the ER.

422
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,435
She's going
to need hydrating, anyway.

423
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,599
Between her breeding party...

424
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,796
and the travelogue
of sexcapades in her diary...

425
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,032
we have an excellent cross section
of inappropriate sexual partners.

426
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,272
Jeremy, I was dead serious
when I said whatever it takes.

427
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,238
<i>My intention is to bring this bitch
to her knees.</i>

428
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,312
Which, ironically,
happens to be her favorite position.

429
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,597
- It's nice to meet you, Mr. Sutherland.
- All right.

430
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,551
Thanks.
You got it.

431
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,590
I got a good feeling about this, James.
This guy Saddler's tough.

432
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,035
Christian, it makes me uneasy...

433
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,270
to hear you talking like this
in front of Wilber.

434
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,069
You don't want him to grow up thinking
his mother is a whore, do you?

435
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,431
James, I need you on board here.

436
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,718
Litigation's hardball,
and I intend on winning.

437
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,396
I guess you're right. What do I know?

438
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,232
Hey, guy, come here.

439
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,596
By the way, I've been meaning to ask you.

440
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,916
What is your religious affiliation?

441
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,473
Well, James, I was raised Catholic.

442
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,919
Still go to church?

443
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,155
No.

444
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,835
Before I leave
I'd like to see my son baptized.

445
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,315
Is there a church you'd like to do it in?

446
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,679
102, this is not good.

447
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,150
I'll begin hydration and start her
on Compazine to stop the vomiting.

448
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,869
- I want a CAT scan.
- I'll go order a CAT scan.

449
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,919
What is he, 12?

450
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,873
Am I going to die?

451
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,950
No, sweetheart, you're not going to die.
This is just a bad flu.

452
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,711
Chew on these ice chips, honey.

453
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,073
- What's wrong?
- I can't feel it.

454
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,998
Can you feel this?

455
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,272
Can you feel this, Princess?

456
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,752
Honey, Mommy's going to look
between your legs, okay?

457
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,079
Extremity numbness
is a symptom of toxic shock.

458
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,198
Bend your knees, honey.

459
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,519
Don't. I need it.

460
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,838
Why were you trying out
one of Mommy's tampons?

461
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:48,359
Matt said I was going to leave a stain.
I don't want to.

462
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,916
I don't want to get old and bleed.

463
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,159
Hello, Mrs. Grubman.

464
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,872
- I came by to see how you're doing.
- Liar.

465
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,274
Don't worry, I'm not going to sue you.

466
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,073
- Is this a bad time?
- No. She could use a break.

467
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,789
Come on.

468
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,438
I'm not a child.

469
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,872
- So, you looked good on those bars.
- Who are you kidding?

470
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,679
I can't walk.

471
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,511
I can't feed myself.

472
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,670
I need you to do something
for me, Dr. Troy.

473
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,998
Fix my face.

474
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,879
This time I can't.

475
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,152
You've had neurological damage,
and I can't lift that, and I can't repair it.

476
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,074
I'm sorry.

477
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,753
So that's it, then.

478
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,599
I lost the race.

479
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,474
- Who were you running against?
- Time.

480
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,952
Hand me my purse, would you?

481
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,708
Just because I feel dead
doesn't mean I have to look embalmed.

482
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,595
Here.

483
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,591
Here. Let me help you.

484
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,075
- You have a baby, right?
- A boy.

485
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,633
His name is Wilber.

486
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,553
You look like a kid when you say his name.

487
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,879
Now the cheeks.

488
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,350
We're not that different, you and I.

489
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,314
Don't miss out on his childhood...

490
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,598
because you're too busy
looking in the mirror.

491
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,034
There. That's my beautiful girl.

492
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,315
I need one more surgery.

493
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,193
- Mrs. Grubman, I told you I can't...
- No, not for me.

494
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,878
Claire's breast reconstruction.

495
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,754
Of course.

496
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,833
Here we are.

497
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,032
Are you mad at me?

498
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,356
No, sweetheart.

499
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,079
I'm just sad you were so scared
of getting older.

500
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,715
Are you sad about getting older?

501
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,153
Sometimes.

502
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,516
But yet there are some wonderful
things about getting older, too.

503
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,318
Really? Like what?

504
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:43,071
Well, if you're lucky,
you get a little bit of wisdom...

505
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,559
so you can have nice talks
with your daughter like we're having now.

506
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,830
Is wisdom why you changed our food?

507
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,513
It was horrible, Mom.

508
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,319
Matt wasn't the only one
who felt that way.

509
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,233
That's the other thing about getting older.

510
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,513
It gets a little easier
to admit your mistakes.

511
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,594
Let's get you ready for your bedtime story.

512
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,513
Okay, once upon a time,
there was a princess...

513
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:21,189
and she liked this prince
and they decided to get married.

514
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,477
Did she wear a wedding dress?

515
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,276
<i>Yeah, and it was beautiful.</i>

516
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,434
<i>And they had a lovely ceremony...</i>

517
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,720
<i>and afterwards they went
on a honeymoon.</i>

518
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,548
<i>Then what happened?</i>

519
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,152
Then, they decided to make a baby.

520
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,993
So here's what they did,
which is what grownups do.

521
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,956
<i>The prince put his penis
in the princess' vagina...</i>

522
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,791
<i>and they all lived happily ever after.</i>

523
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,678
Cut.
End sticks.

524
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,998
Wilber, I baptize thee,
in the name of the Father...

525
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,553
and the Son...

526
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,479
and the Holy Spirit.

527
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,749
<i>Amen.</i>

528
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,996
God the Father now anoints
you with the chrism of salvation.

529
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,152
You are a new creation
and have clothed yourself in Christ.

530
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,437
Go in peace, Wilber.
And may the Lord be with you.

531
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,318
When I was a kid, my grandmother
used to light a candle every Friday.

532
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:28,510
She said every flickering wick
stood for an unanswered prayer.

533
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,953
- What did you pray for?
- Strength.

534
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,831
It's what I'm going to need
when I tell my wife and sons...

535
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,438
I have another child.

536
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,232
I'd like to hold my son now, James.

537
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,789
He's not your son, Christian.

538
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,675
He's mine. His birth was God's gift to me.

539
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,749
This child has renewed me.

540
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,675
He makes me feel young again.

541
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,910
What are you saying, James?
That you're taking Wilber home with you?

542
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,913
- Yes.
- I won't let that happen.

543
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,351
It's not your choice, Christian.

544
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,310
- You can be his godfather.
- That's not enough.

545
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,199
I'm sorry, Christian.

546
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,477
I'm deeply sorry.

547
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,559
