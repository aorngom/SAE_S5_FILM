1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,995
<i>Previously on Nip / Tuck:</i>

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,878
I had my breasts augmented.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,473
Julia's in crisis.

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,312
You broke her, you fix her.

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,358
Do you like them?

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,310
- It doesn't matter what I think.
- Screw you, Sean.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,513
- How long have you had a drug habit?
- I don't have a drug habit.

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,633
I was prescribed the painkillers
after the surgery.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,634
Interesting, the doctor who gave you the
implants tell you to take half the bottle...

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,950
and wash it down
with four glasses of Pinot Grigio?

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,078
Enough, Sean. She's here to talk about
her facial reconstruction.

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,878
Just getting all the information.

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,837
I obviously don't know
everything about you.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,956
I wanna make sure
you're not hiding anything...

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,076
that could lead you
to stroke out on the table.

16
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,275
Could I have a stroke?

17
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,115
You are not going to have a stroke.
You're going to be fine.

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,238
- Did Annie find you?
- Enough with the interrogation.

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,551
I had enough questions
at the emergency room.

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,557
I'm here for a reason.
Can you fix my face or not?

21
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,389
Your x-rays from the ER
came back negative for a ZMC fracture.

22
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,279
We'd have to explore for any
damage to the salivary ducts.

23
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,634
In other words, yes.

24
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,395
You're very lucky. You were millimeters
away from cutting your carotid artery.

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,710
You would've died
looking at the popcorn ceiling...

26
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,075
in your lovely Marine Gardens apartment.

27
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,789
Maybe you should leave
and I will handle this without you.

28
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,994
You're right. I can't do this.

29
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,753
I obviously don't feel comfortable
operating on you.

30
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,914
So long as Christian doesn't have
a problem doing the surgery.

31
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,996
No, Sean. You. I want you to do it.

32
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,839
Julia, may I remind you that your mother
was very happy with her face-lift.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,391
Nobody knows my face
better than you, Sean. Nobody.

34
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,632
And your breasts?
You didn't come to me for them.

35
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,629
Why don't you make an appointment
with Dr. Copley?

36
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,998
No, Sean. I want you to repair me,
because you're the reason I'm here.

37
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,432
Here it comes. The whole goddamn world
is conspiring against you.

38
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,479
You're the reason I got the implants.
You're the reason that I was so upset...

39
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,995
that I didn't see the sliding glass door.

40
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,912
And that's the reason we're over.

41
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,755
You can't take responsibility for your
failures or weaknesses. You never could.

42
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,674
That's why you're sitting there
with your face torn to shreds!

43
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,551
I'm sorry, but I can't possibly
fix your face and make you beautiful again.

44
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,515
The only thing I see
when I look at you anymore is ugliness.

45
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,715
Guess I'm runner-up in everything.

46
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,600
Do you always spy on people like that?

47
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,275
I knocked at the front door.
You didn't answer.

48
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,635
I was worried you'd taken
too many pills again.

49
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,112
Look, Ava, I am not in the mood
for your withering shit right now. Okay?

50
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,990
I'm just...

51
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,436
Trying to come up with an excuse
not to invite me in?

52
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,509
Don't worry. I won't stay.

53
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,398
- Unless you ask me to.
- Why would I ever do that?

54
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,235
'Cause I might have something
to offer you, something you want back.

55
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,796
Like, my son?

56
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,672
Yourself. I'm here to help you find it again.
I know you've fallen on hard times...

57
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,116
so I'd like to offer my services
as a life coach, free of charge.

58
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,034
Maybe you should try coaching someone
whose child you haven't molested.

59
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,955
If you want to blame your inertia
on my relationship with Matt...

60
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,439
that's your prerogative.

61
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,195
We both know it had nothing to do
with going face-first through a glass door.

62
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,079
Or having breast implants,
the dissolution of your marriage...

63
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,832
Why are you even here?

64
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,078
Matt's upset
at your personal disintegration.

65
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,315
When a person I love is in pain,
so am I.

66
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,278
And I know I'm the person
who can help take your pain away.

67
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,637
You know what you are, Ava? A vulture.

68
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,834
Sometimes we have to be
brought to our knees...

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,312
in order to get in touch with who
we really are and what we really want.

70
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,154
We can't heal until we hit rock bottom.

71
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,278
By the look of things, Julia, you're there.

72
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,753
You have nothing to offer me, Ava.

73
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,190
I simply don't agree, Julia.

74
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,871
Not when every major decision
in your life...

75
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,191
has been predicated
on other people's expectations.

76
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,557
Dropping out of medical school,
your choice of husband, motherhood.

77
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,837
- I love my children.
- On the one hand.

78
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,236
And on the other,
you deeply regret ever having them.

79
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,312
I know. You're not supposed to have
those feelings. Those feelings aren't nice.

80
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,756
But you know what they say:

81
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,631
"Nice girls finish last,
real ones finish first. "

82
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,039
Call me when you feel like getting real.

83
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,393
This pucker almost made me puke.
What happened to her?

84
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,394
Early stages of necrosis. Caused,
no doubt, by an untreated infection...

85
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,916
from allergic reaction
to an unknown cosmetic enhancer.

86
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,120
How much of our business
comes from cleaning up...

87
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,918
after another surgeon's incompetence?

88
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,914
20%/%, which is down from 30%/%
since Bobolit left town.

89
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,869
Do we know who did this hack job?

90
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,279
Lauren Copley.

91
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,594
The doctor who's doing
Julia's face did this?

92
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,639
She has such a stellar reputation.
Reputations don't mean shit.

93
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,270
If every girl I met decided
to sleep with me or not on mine...

94
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,589
they would be scared off...

95
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,638
and I'd be doing
the five-finger knuckle shuffle every night.

96
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,473
Yet we all know
that is rarely the case.

97
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,198
Another job repaired.

98
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,831
I gave you the walk-in report.

99
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,878
Some slime ball in Jacksonville
did this job.

100
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,995
I know.

101
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,359
Aren't you hungry?

102
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,717
I'm not allowed to eat
before the operation, honey.

103
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,510
Why? Will you throw it up or something?

104
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,672
No. It's just a precaution.

105
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,838
Are you gonna die?

106
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,992
She'll be fine, kiddo.

107
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,114
It doesn't hurt as much as it looks.

108
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,549
You don't look like my mom anymore.

109
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,472
- Could you please...
- Sure.

110
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,838
Hey, Matty.
Hey.

111
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,718
- Hey, everyone.
- Hey.

112
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,348
Hey, baby.

113
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,070
Thanks for taking her to school.

114
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,156
Matt, maybe you can go help your sister
pack her book bag?

115
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,754
Sure. Come on, honey. Let's go.

116
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,390
I haven't handled this well.

117
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,753
You're angry. I understand.

118
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,798
I keep trying to forgive you.

119
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,438
I keep trying to be in love with you again.

120
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,471
I just can't get there.

121
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,875
Yeah.

122
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,078
But I do miss us.

123
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,032
And I miss our family.

124
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,915
Usually, my patients don't cry
until after the surgery...

125
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,038
when they see the results.

126
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,951
- I'm not one of your patients, Sean.
- Yes, you are.

127
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,433
If you want.

128
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,637
We have an opening in our schedule
this morning.

129
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,359
I don't want you operating on me
out of pity.

130
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,956
I'm not. I'm operating on you
because I'm the best.

131
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,114
How long will I be under?
Around two hours.

132
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,874
Liz'll send you to twilight land.
When we're finished...

133
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,155
you won't remember a thing.

134
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,278
Want us to smooth out
the lines while repaving the road?

135
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,318
No. I find my lines comforting.

136
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,636
And with the two of you, I've earned them.

137
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,438
You certainly have.

138
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,318
What's that saying?

139
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,314
"Wrinkles remind the soul
where it's been and where it hasn't. "

140
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,948
You ready?

141
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,116
Yeah. One last thing.

142
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,272
While I'm under,
can you take my implants out?

143
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,832
They're just not me.

144
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,670
Julia, count backwards for me.

145
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,792
Ten.
Nine, eight...

146
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,515
seven, six, five...

147
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,874
four, three...

148
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,229
Julia.

149
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,278
<i>Wake up, sleepyhead.</i>

150
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,672
Very nice. Like it never happened.

151
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,590
Which, I guess, is the point.

152
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,357
What are you doing here?

153
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,071
I'm your coach. From your other life.

154
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,838
The one dreamt of, but not chosen.

155
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,518
- This isn't real.
- Always with the cynicism.

156
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,958
- I'm hallucinating from the anesthetic.
- Life is a hallucination, Julia.

157
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,112
- Where am I? Tell me.
- No need to be afraid.

158
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,710
You're in your possibility.

159
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,150
The place where fresh starts come true.

160
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,833
I know this bed.

161
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,037
I would hope so.
It's Christian's, from college.

162
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,989
Where you had your only sexual encounter
with the man of your dreams.

163
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,391
<i>You got off that bed that fateful night
and swung home to Sean.</i>

164
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,073
The safe choice.

165
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,953
But even though you committed
to one man...

166
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,833
your heart's always been with another.
Isn't that right?

167
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,512
Haven't you always wondered
what it would have been like...

168
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,878
if you hadn't left Christian that night?
If you'd stayed with him?

169
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,792
Then do it. Take that chance. Explore.

170
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,158
Get off that bed and into your possibility.

171
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,035
Well, don't just stand there.
You have a patient waiting.

172
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,115
Tell me what you don't like
about yourself, Mrs. Epstein.

173
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,112
My breasts. I don't like my breasts.

174
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,514
Suzanne. I know her.
Not in this life.

175
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,874
I don't understand.

176
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,191
How interesting that even
in possibility you lack common sense.

177
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,875
Apparently, you're a bitch
in every universe you inhabit.

178
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,153
I'm a bitch to you, because you need
the cold, hard slap of truth.

179
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,676
You should've never fired me
in that other life.

180
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,628
I could've made that shit hole you called
an existence gleam with accomplishment.

181
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,439
I'm the only one who tells you straight,
without bullshit.

182
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,034
Then stop the harangue
and coach me through it.

183
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,111
Why don't I know Suzanne?

184
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,431
Because in this life, your daughters
never went to the same school.

185
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,589
So you never met.

186
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,514
Suzanne is just an anonymous walk-in
off the street who repeated her destiny...

187
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,830
and became an
unfulfilled suburban nothing...

188
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,911
with a gas-guzzling SUV.

189
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,991
You turned a different corner
and became a doctor.

190
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,593
That's what I wanted to be.

191
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,354
How many sizes would you like to go up?

192
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,671
- What are you?
- A low C.

193
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,351
God, they're beautiful.

194
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,554
- My husband did them.
- Sorry I'm late.

195
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,076
Just finishing off a surgery.

196
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,355
I was just admiring your handiwork.
Very nice, Doctor.

197
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,675
Just a little trifle
for our fifteenth wedding anniversary.

198
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,514
- What did you get him?
- Pec implants.

199
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,557
We can administer the AlloDerm
to round out the upper lip...

200
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,154
at the same time we do the implants.

201
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,799
Who'll be doing all of this?

202
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,952
My wife and I
do all of our surgeries together.

203
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,280
That way, you're in doubly good hands.

204
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,354
- Are you all right?
- No.

205
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,913
It's just seeing you two together.
So sweet and loving with each other.

206
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,514
Avi hasn't touched me for two years.

207
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,989
That's why I'm doing all of this.

208
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,358
I'm sure you and your husband
will work it out.

209
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,349
Not everyone has what you two have.

210
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,629
<i>I'm successful and he loves me.</i>

211
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,832
He's pussy-whipped.

212
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,996
You are the Holy Grail,
the thing he desired the most.

213
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,034
But because he landed you so early,
he lost that ferocious drive and daring...

214
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,795
that defined him in his other life
and made him so irresistible to you...

215
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,871
- like catnip.
- You're fired.

216
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,235
Because I'm not telling you
what you wanna hear?

217
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,277
Tough shit. I'm staying.

218
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,635
- I'm dying to see how it ends.
- I'll make this one work. I want it all.

219
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,391
And you have it all, Julia.
The house, the career...

220
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,276
a life without limits
that most women can only dream of.

221
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,595
You're your own hobby. Congrats.

222
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,188
Checkmate.

223
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,949
We've been asked to chair
the philharmonic opener next month.

224
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,879
- I could give a shit.
- I know. It's so goddamn boring.

225
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,639
- I booked Míkonos for August.
- Great.

226
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,989
You look fantastic in that dress,
by the way. It suits you.

227
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,590
I need more collagen in my lips.

228
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,276
I'll do it in the morning.

229
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,759
<i>You have money and power
and independence.</i>

230
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,920
With so much to give, why no children?

231
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,790
After the age of 35,
the eggs a woman produces...

232
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,839
are of a much poorer quality
than those she produces in her 20s.

233
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,670
I was starting a business in my 20s.
We've been over this. I didn't have time.

234
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,553
- Shit. So now I'm one of them.
- One of who?

235
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,997
One of those cliché barren women...

236
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,948
who have to pump themselves
full of hormones and do the in vitro thing.

237
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,712
That's one option.

238
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,119
As a fertilization expert...

239
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,556
this isn't economically advantageous
of me to say, Mrs. Troy...

240
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,032
- but you could always adopt.
- No. That wasn't the plan.

241
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,151
Christian, my husband,
he was put up for adoption...

242
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,913
and he wants to have a biological child.
That's important to him.

243
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,230
- Are those yours?
- Yes.

244
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,873
Jonah's 15. Samantha's 19.

245
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,715
She's starting Smith in the fall.

246
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,232
You started so young.

247
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,313
I made the time.

248
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,155
What? Get her prepped.
I'll be there in an hour.

249
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,954
<i>15-blade.</i>

250
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,273
How's she doing?

251
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,313
Her heart's a little rocky.
Just like yours was last night.

252
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,398
I told you, don't discuss
what we do in the office.

253
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,314
What? He's not here. Who cares?
I do. It's not professional.

254
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,954
Anyway,
we need a cooling-off period.

255
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,871
I'm trying to get pregnant.

256
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,669
Toddlers are the hot new accessory.

257
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,991
Fine. I need to find someone
my own age, anyway.

258
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,718
Nice. Concentrate on the patient.

259
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,351
I'm giving her ephedrine.

260
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,270
Shit, she's in defib. Charge to 200.

261
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,194
We can't give her 200 joules.
I need to get these implants out.

262
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,511
Give her an amp of epi. Clear!

263
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,600
You're late. We started without you.

264
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,238
I'm sorry. I forgot.

265
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,994
Who's this?

266
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,951
Hi. I'm Kimber.

267
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,639
I thought we were getting
a brunette tonight.

268
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,438
I'll go get my wig.

269
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,034
Bad day?

270
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,828
The worst.

271
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,437
I have to start all the in vitro shit,
as we feared.

272
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,513
- Good for me. No condoms.
- With her, you wear the condoms.

273
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,719
I wish you hadn't gone sailing today.
I lost a patient.

274
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,949
Who?

275
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,319
- Suzanne Epstein.
- Please, don't guilt me over this.

276
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,910
Four hands are better than two,
remember?

277
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,595
I've spent years building up a business
I'm now bored of.

278
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,355
- I just want to enjoy my life.
- I can't take on all our caseload.

279
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,431
Then hire another doctor.

280
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,112
Very china doll. I like it.

281
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,630
I'm going to go take a shower.

282
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,315
Have her stay.
Julia.

283
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,031
I like it when you watch.

284
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,759
Oh!

285
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,638
Darling, there's messages for you.

286
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,351
I moved Miss Russo's vaginal rejuvenation
from 1:00 tomorrow until 4:00...

287
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,751
so you could get your hormone shots.
And here's your coffee.

288
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,112
Jesus, Mother, you know I like it black.
You're completely incompetent.

289
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,358
Get it straight
or go back to selling Herbalife.

290
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,353
I'm so sorry, dear. I will try harder.
One last thing.

291
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,559
The doctor you wanted to interview
is in your office with Dr. Troy.

292
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,434
Who is it?

293
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,712
For God's sakes, stop playing
the blushing ingénue.

294
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,199
You know who's in there.

295
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,399
You couldn't wait to check up and see
how he's doing, how he looks.

296
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,235
Julia, it's so great to see you again.

297
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,190
My God. How long's it been
since we've all been in the same room?

298
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,238
- Ten years.
- No, it's 15, actually.

299
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,436
- I can't get over it. You look...
- Great. I mean, you look really...

300
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,033
You look great.

301
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,672
I look great, too.

302
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,995
So, Sean, how's the practice?
Still in Fort Lauderdale?

303
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,152
No, I sold my client list and packed up
around three years ago.

304
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,198
It's pure chance
that I got your call about the job offer.

305
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,669
- I literally got home last night.
- From where?

306
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,195
New Guinea.
I've been stationed there for six months.

307
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,238
Aren't you a little old for the Peace Corps?

308
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,470
<i>I'm in Médecins Sans Frontières.</i>

309
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,550
Huh?

310
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,319
Doctors Without Borders.

311
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,790
We travel around the world helping people
who've stepped on land mines...

312
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,995
women and children.

313
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,118
<i>Oh, yeah.
I read about that in People magazine.</i>

314
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,997
You fix cleft palates for free,
that kind of shit.

315
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,949
Right.

316
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,668
How noble.

317
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,998
How do you survive?

318
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,598
My wife works.
She's got a great job, actually.

319
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,439
Great.
I'd love to meet her.

320
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,596
Yes. So would I.

321
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,311
Jesus, I feel like I'm
in a Pottery Barn showroom.

322
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,760
It's nice. It's a family home.

323
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,958
Christian, Julia,
I'd like you to meet my wife.

324
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,117
Megan O'Hara McNamara,
meet Doctor and Doctor Troy.

325
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,393
- Julia, I've heard so much about you.
- I bet.

326
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,629
- Your house is lovely.
- Thank you.

327
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,553
And so are you.

328
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,716
And what do you do, Megan?

329
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,358
Other than being a mom,
I'm a pediatrician.

330
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,391
I never got to meet Megan
before she died of cancer.

331
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,556
They seem perfect together.

332
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,119
And doesn't Sean seem gloriously happy...

333
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,876
having a wife who's happy
to be with him...

334
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,918
who isn't constantly thinking
the grass is greener?

335
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,356
It can make such a difference
in a man's disposition.

336
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,991
They have a child together?

337
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,755
It's so great to finally meet people
who went to college with my dad.

338
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,239
Bet he was a real party animal.

339
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,278
Oh, yeah.
He went nuts with the wine coolers.

340
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,990
Actually, Matt,
your father was very dedicated.

341
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,517
He was very into academics,
like it sounds you are.

342
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,876
- Matt's on the Brain Bowl.
- The what?

343
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,512
It's the academic decathlon team.
It's for nerds.

344
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,314
Today's nerd
is tomorrow's Bill Gates, honey.

345
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,870
Matt got an early acceptance to Yale.
Full scholarship.

346
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,989
I hope you've got room for dessert.

347
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,913
Why don't you just climb under the table
and give him a blowjob?

348
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,231
What're you talking about?
It's college all over again.

349
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,755
The longing looks,
the disgusting, obvious fawning.

350
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,831
Admit it, Julia, you never got over him.

351
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,276
I am being nice to close the deal.
You should try it.

352
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,039
Here we go.

353
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,870
Oh.

354
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,749
Dr. Christian, do you want to see
my bug collection?

355
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,275
Sure.

356
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,388
Bye, guys.

357
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,109
So, Sean, have you thought
about our offer?

358
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,476
I have. Megan and I have talked it over,
long and hard.

359
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,518
- The money is good.
- I make good money, so...

360
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,474
Sean doesn't have to work
if he doesn't want to.

361
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:05,116
<i>And Doctors Without Borders is an
organization we're both so committed to...</i>

362
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,989
so any sacrifices we have to make
as a family are worth it.

363
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:13,039
But, actually, I'm going to have
to take a couple of months off.

364
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,436
Nine months, exactly.

365
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,668
- You're pregnant.
- I'm three months along. It's a girl.

366
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,431
We're going to call her Annie,
after my grandmother.

367
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,589
Congratulations. Really.

368
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,555
So, with a baby on the way...

369
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,318
I really hated the direction
the cosmetic surgery industry is going...

370
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,752
and I'm not convinced I want to dive back
into those murky waters.

371
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:50,511
I'll tell you what. Why don't you come in
and help for a week...

372
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,830
and see how it strikes you?

373
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,911
Mrs. Grubman, tell me what you don't like
about yourself.

374
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,674
My face. It has too much character.

375
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,590
But you had a rhytidectomy
three years ago.

376
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,593
- I guess it didn't take.
- Didn't take?

377
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,913
I think what Dr. McNamara is saying,
Mrs. Grubman...

378
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,674
is that a face-lift
is a very invasive operation...

379
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,150
and we just want to make sure
you've thought it through.

380
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,359
- How old do you think I am?
- It says here that you're 58.

381
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,234
You were probably very surprised
when you read that.

382
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,470
Actually, after seeing
the number of procedures...

383
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,076
When you've been around
as long as I have, you gain some wisdom.

384
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,552
One of the things I've learned is
that you can stay young, Dr. McNamara.

385
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,718
You can feel the way you felt
when you were 20 years old.

386
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,950
<i>Those feelings don't have to go away.</i>

387
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:48,033
<i>Now, for some people, getting that feeling
comes from running a marathon...</i>

388
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,519
or climbing a mountain.

389
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,716
For others, it comes
from being around children.

390
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,950
But there are many different things
you can do...

391
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,750
As for me, I know myself, Dr. McNamara.
And I know what I like:

392
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,199
plastic surgery.

393
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,396
<i>Now I won't deny
that many people think...</i>

394
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,314
that trying to look younger
is a superficial way of changing your life.

395
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,357
But it reinvigorates me.

396
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,152
And if doing something makes me happy
and feel better about myself...

397
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,551
who are you to stop me?

398
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,637
We'd be happy to schedule you for surgery
tomorrow morning, Mrs. Grubman.

399
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,030
Are you ready?
As I'll ever be.

400
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,428
15-blade.

401
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,989
This was our song in college.
You remembered.

402
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,353
- Good hands in there, Dr. McNamara.
- You, too.

403
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,158
Is that the best pickup line
you can muster?

404
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,393
It wasn't a pickup line. It was the truth.

405
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,799
It was nice finally getting to work together
after all these years.

406
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,630
Good work and good night.

407
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,509
- I need to go now.
- Why? Meatloaf's an easy reheat.

408
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,514
- Julia, what are you doing?
- Blocking your way.

409
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,669
Why?

410
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,833
So we can finish what we started in there.

411
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,791
What we started years ago.

412
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,314
I want you.

413
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,149
I can't.

414
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,629
What's wrong?

415
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,872
What's wrong? I'm married.
I'm about to have another baby.

416
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,275
You want me as much as I want you.
You know you do.

417
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,556
Stop it. You're married, too.

418
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,113
I chose the wrong guy. I know that now.

419
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,071
We can go off together.

420
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,869
We can go away and see
if what we once had still exists.

421
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,712
I said, stop it.

422
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:49,349
I don't love you, Julia. I love my wife.

423
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,678
- It was wrong to do this. I'm sorry.
- So am I. I'm sorry for you.

424
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,916
What happened to you? I don't even know
this person you've turned into.

425
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,913
You're nihilistic, you prey
on psychologically-damaged women...

426
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,196
- and turn them into monsters.
- Just leave, Sean.

427
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,191
You're soulless, Julia.

428
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,433
Well, this soulless bitch
earns $2 million a year...

429
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,592
and if you have trouble
supporting your precious family...

430
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,399
with your politically correct bullshit...

431
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,198
call me for a loan.

432
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,238
On second thought,
I'd rather watch you starve.

433
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,433
Goodbye, Julia.

434
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,838
What are you doing?

435
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,591
I found this old album.

436
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,353
We used to play it in college, remember?

437
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,554
I remember.

438
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,279
Dance with me.

439
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,793
Make love to me.

440
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,832
Are you ovulating?

441
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,389
My final tests came back today.

442
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,352
I can't have children.

443
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,713
We can adopt.

444
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,392
Kimber's pregnant.

445
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,228
It's mine.

446
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,118
Get rid of it. Then get rid of her.

447
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,196
She wants to have this baby.

448
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,794
So do I.

449
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,549
Get out!

450
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,435
You should be happy, Julia.
Now you're free to pursue Sean.

451
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,358
It's happening again.

452
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,832
But it shouldn't be. I'm living another life.

453
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,871
Sweetheart, it's you who has to change,
not your circumstances.

454
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,156
You carry your fate with you.

455
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,315
You didn't do the work on yourself
in this life or the one before it.

456
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:38,156
You didn't face your demons and fears
and conquer them bravely with conviction.

457
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,993
Patio door, a glass shower stall
in your fancy marble bathroom.

458
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,669
You were going to go through
a plate-glass window anyway.

459
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,796
Who found her?
The maid.

460
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,558
I appreciate you helping out
with this, Sean.

461
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,754
I don't know
if I can get through this alone.

462
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,838
It's not your fault, Christian.
She's always been unhappy.

463
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,274
She's always been lost.

464
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,750
<i>Despite her wonderful qualities,
Julia was never satisfied.</i>

465
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,309
And I don't think she ever will be.

466
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,954
15-blade.

467
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,072
- What are you doing?
- Killing you softly.

468
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,631
That's not your decision.

469
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,236
Actually, it is.

470
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,076
You see, I've lied to you.

471
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,237
I'm not your life coach.

472
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,951
I'm the Angel of Death.

473
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,399
Not true.

474
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,595
Yes. Aren't you just a little relieved?

475
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,191
The end is in sight now.

476
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,595
No more squandered potential
or ruined possibilities.

477
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,634
One kiss...

478
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,509
all the pain you've been carrying around
for years goes away.

479
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,278
Haven't you always wanted
to kiss me, Julia?

480
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,878
- No.
- Liar.

481
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:01,233
For once, admit the truth
and embrace your possibility fearlessly.

482
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,715
Haven't you always wanted to see
what it would be like...

483
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,632
to kiss another woman?

484
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,554
To kiss me?

485
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,754
You can't deny it. We have chemistry.

486
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,714
I'm afraid.

487
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,393
But you've always been afraid,
haven't you?

488
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,313
End the fear.

489
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,394
End it now.

490
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,590
No!

491
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,999
I'm not ready!

492
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,914
What the hell was that?
Are we okay?

493
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,160
It must have been a short. She's fine.

494
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,158
Let's close her up.

495
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,478
Julia.

496
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,832
We're all done now. You did great.

497
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,589
- Am I dead?
- No, you're in recovery.

498
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,238
I'm going to be sick.

499
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,116
It's okay. This is normal.

500
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,716
You're just having a bad reaction
to the anesthesia.

501
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,275
Here...

502
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,878
