1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,359
<i>Previously on Nip / Tuck:</i>

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,233
I could sleep over next time.
Wouldn't that be great?

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,871
What would be great is if you could
come quicker, so I could get some rest.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,114
I don't want there to be
any weirdness between us, okay?

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,754
Save the father-son talk for your daddy.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,394
Your psychobabble attempt
at bonding is pathetic.

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,836
The truth of the matter is
you're denied nothing.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,833
Really, Mom? When I asked you
and Matt to keep it down...

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,959
while you were humping the other night,
you didn't do that for me.

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,519
That's denial.

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,678
Did he mean what he just said?

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,671
Watch your lip, mister.

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,669
You're not too old for a backhand,
and I'm wearing heavy rings.

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,674
Fine, I'll play along. But then I get a favor.

15
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,996
Miss Garcia, tell us
what you don't like about yourself?

16
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,720
Look what a stupid idiot I am.

17
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,556
In this world, you don't get
something for nothing.

18
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,119
Why couldn't I just accept it?

19
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,430
Barbara Busberger referred Miss Garcia.

20
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,672
She's generously offered to cover
her medical expenses.

21
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,034
She's my boss.

22
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,590
She said I'd have bad scars
if I went to my HMO clinic.

23
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,437
Mrs. Busberger told me
you'd been to a BOTOX party.

24
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,152
But, honestly, Miss Garcia,
this doesn't look like the result of BOTOX.

25
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,993
It's not really BOTOX.

26
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,720
Then what was injected into your face?

27
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,590
My girlfriend Lillian and me...

28
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,320
she's a housekeeper for a family in Boca...

29
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,519
we were having our nails done
at Madam Rose's...

30
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,196
and we were talking about our ladies.

31
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,033
You know, how good they always look...

32
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,079
how they never age because of
all the plastic surgery and BOTOX.

33
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,870
Madam Rose says she knows
this doctor who makes his own BOTOX.

34
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,600
Only it lasts longer than the real kind.

35
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,318
And it's cheaper.

36
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,229
So when Mrs. Busberger
went to Sardinia...

37
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,839
I had a party.

38
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,277
<i>And he said he could do six girls
for $600, which is pretty good.</i>

39
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,869
<i>So we all saved up and hired him.</i>

40
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,196
<i>We all felt like we had won the lottery.</i>

41
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,076
We all ended up like this.

42
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,957
Has anyone reported this doctor?
Or Madam Rose?

43
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,797
We don't like to involve the police,
if you know what I mean.

44
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,791
Some of us aren't legal.

45
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,110
So if it's not BOTOX
this quack is peddling...

46
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,793
you have any idea what it is?

47
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,873
He just calls it "BOBOTOX,"
after his own name.

48
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,554
- He has a really weird name.
- BOBOTOX?

49
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,631
- You mean Bobolit?
- Yeah. His name's Bobolit.

50
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,713
I want my money.

51
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,438
This is a little low,
even for a hack like Bobolit.

52
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,636
What is
Merrill putting in this?

53
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,109
Necrosis is consistent
with a silicone base.

54
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,396
How many others are out there...

55
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,754
with this poison in their face?

56
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,436
$100 a pop. He's probably shot up
half the housekeepers in Miami by now.

57
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,272
Movies, magazines, TV shows.

58
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,035
We're bombarded daily by images
we all aspire to but can't attain.

59
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,079
You want what you can't have.
It'll make you do horrible things.

60
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,400
You're right.
This is all my fault.

61
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,071
What are you talking about?

62
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,996
I'm the reason
Merrill lost his license.

63
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,230
He lost it for
operating on a dog.

64
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,313
He wouldn't have done it if I
hadn't referred him that case we declined.

65
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,469
I knew he'd take it.

66
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,596
He's been self-destructing
since college.

67
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,671
He had to fall off the deep end.

68
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,910
This isn't negligence.
This is criminal.

69
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,436
Right. Regardless of what she said,
we need to go to the police.

70
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,589
No.

71
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,556
You go to the police,
you'll get these women deported.

72
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,995
If I can talk to Merrill...

73
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,232
I'm sure I'll be able to
shut his operation down.

74
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,154
I caused this problem.
Let me fix it.

75
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,399
15-blade.

76
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,990
Nice business you got going.

77
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,879
Did you steal those, too?
Yeah.

78
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,555
When you and my mom were soaping
each other's privates in the shower.

79
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,757
She's got a lethal stash of Vicodin,
in case you haven't noticed.

80
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,150
I might have if I hadn't been
looking for my jacket.

81
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,514
What are you doing wearing it?

82
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,353
I needed a safe place
to keep my stuff from would-be narcs.

83
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,750
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have customers waiting.

84
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,592
I never said you could borrow my jacket.

85
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,514
I never said you could move in
with my mom, so get used to it.

86
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,590
I got put in your school so she didn't
have to play double-duty chauffeur.

87
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,877
That's bullshit, asshole.
You got expelled from school for truancy.

88
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,951
This place was your last hope
for graduation.

89
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,633
You're the asshole, asshole.

90
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,189
Ever since you showed up,
I haven't got shit from her.

91
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,078
Not even lunch money.

92
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,716
Consider this a down payment
on what you owe me.

93
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,791
I don't owe you anything.

94
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,190
Hey, give me my jacket back.

95
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,994
Now you got blood on it.
You're gonna pay to get this cleaned.

96
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,115
Doctor?

97
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,876
You said my chemical peel should be on
for 10 minutes. It's been at least 20.

98
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,998
Don't interrupt me.

99
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,038
But I can't take anymore.
My face is on fire.

100
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,993
Wipe yourself down. Mild discomfort
is normal for the first hour.

101
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,073
Mani or pedi?

102
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,589
BOBOTOX.

103
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,793
Madam Rose taking cigarette break
out back.

104
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,714
You wait.

105
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,792
I have an appointment.

106
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,791
A cold compress
and aspirin helps.

107
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,154
Thank you.

108
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,040
Let me take a look. I'm a real doctor.

109
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,432
Christ.
Don't listen to him.

110
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,876
You'll be fine. I'm the best.
Pay Madam Rose outside.

111
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,431
My card. Call me tomorrow.
I'll give you a free follow-up.

112
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,189
<i>Gracias.</i>

113
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,394
Nice place, Merrill.
How long you been squatting?

114
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,278
I knew you'd show up.

115
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,035
Coming to rub it in?

116
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,156
Think you can kick me
when I'm down?

117
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,834
Well, the joke's on you, Christian.

118
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,749
I'm doing better than I ever was.

119
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,714
Really? Because when I stopped
by your house earlier...

120
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,634
the new owner said that he'd bought
the house from the bank at foreclosure.

121
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,030
BOBOTOX is a revolution, Christian.

122
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,839
For the first time,
all women, not just the privileged...

123
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,877
can afford to look good.

124
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,590
It's literally changing the face
of plastic surgery.

125
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,034
You got that right.

126
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,510
Sean and I had to remove the scalp
of one of your patients the other day.

127
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,796
Madam Rose and I
are still perfecting the formula.

128
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,633
You concocted that crap with a woman
who runs a nail salon?

129
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,518
Manicurial empire.

130
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,074
She has 3 locations.

131
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,835
We met in bankruptcy court
after her massage parlors went belly up.

132
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,514
There is one thing I did learn
from you, Christian.

133
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,677
A partner is the key
to any successful business.

134
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,198
You're hanging on
by a thread here, Merrill.

135
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,592
- I came to offer my help.
- You're wasting my time.

136
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,356
After the Kimber debacle, I finally found
a lady who makes me very happy. See?

137
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,112
I'm just like you. I got it all.

138
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,793
How long you been
sucking on that thing?

139
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,073
I don't really count the first six months.

140
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,636
You're coming with me, Merrill.

141
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,837
I'll get you into a good 12-step program,
you're gonna get better.

142
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,150
Clean up,
and start your business over.

143
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,276
Our business is fine.

144
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,716
What the hell's going on, Bobolit?
We got patients outside who pay cash.

145
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,678
Christian, this is Madam Rose.

146
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,709
She's short.

147
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,632
You socialize after work, Bobolit.

148
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,758
This isn't socializing.
This is an intervention.

149
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,036
Merrill's not feeling good.
I'm taking him home.

150
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,509
Wait. Not feeling good?
He just needs some gas.

151
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,274
Are you kidding? He doesn't need this.
This is killing him!

152
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,589
Get your shit. We're leaving.

153
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,591
He's not going. He has full schedule today.

154
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,469
Listen, lady, this chop shop of yours
is operating illegally.

155
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,831
Can I call you back, Matty?

156
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,029
You're getting suspended?

157
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,872
The boys were set up, Miss Wentworth.

158
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,519
They're nonconforming individuals...

159
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,398
who are both handsome
and high-achieving.

160
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,074
Perfect targets for
ignorant, envious types.

161
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,760
I think you're in a bit of denial,
Mrs. Moore.

162
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,909
Ms.

163
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,791
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

164
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,916
Have a seat, Mr. McNamara.

165
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,630
It's Troy. Dr. Christian Troy.

166
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,119
I'm confused.
I thought you were his father.

167
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,670
I am. I'm his biological father.

168
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,909
I have two dads.

169
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,752
Was there a divorce?

170
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,078
Got it. Two dads.

171
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,796
Emily Willis has
two mommies. We're seeing more of this.

172
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,997
Matt's father is my partner,
Dr. Sean McNamara.

173
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,149
I understand.

174
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,038
They're not gay, Miss Wentworth.

175
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,760
My mom slept with Christian
before she married my dad.

176
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,911
I don't have
any father figures...

177
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,150
but Matt's living at my house,
screwing my mom...

178
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,880
so I pretend he's my dad.
It's true.

179
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,270
Matt and I are lovers. I was his life coach.

180
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,398
You see, Matt has a problem.
He's a premature ejaculator.

181
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,515
Enough.

182
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,433
I deal with dysfunctional families
on a daily basis...

183
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,752
and trust me, everyone has a story,
and none of you are that special.

184
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,590
Thirty-day suspension is what we give
when drugs are involved. End of subject.

185
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,793
Principal Wentworth, that solution
to a schoolyard dustup is not acceptable.

186
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,918
I prefer we come to a more reasonable
solution right here...

187
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,709
but if we can't,
I'm not above calling a lawyer in.

188
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,639
Excuse me, Ms. Moore.

189
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,951
If I had a dime for every time
a parent threatened legal action...

190
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,314
I'd be living in Key West...

191
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,438
<i>sipping piña coladas
and writing short stories.</i>

192
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,919
Let's try and find a compromise,
shall we, ladies?

193
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,833
What's it gonna take
to cut the boys some slack?

194
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,070
Could the school use a nice contribution...

195
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,073
for computer upgrades?
A brand-new digital scoreboard?

196
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,231
It amazes me how many parents think...

197
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,551
that money is a substitute
for parenting skills.

198
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,149
Your children always give you away.

199
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,880
There are students
here with brains...

200
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,189
who are failing every subject.

201
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,512
And all they talk about is Juicy Couture
and $300 blonde streaks...

202
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,070
and expensive leather jackets
that they're willing to bleed over.

203
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,438
All that opportunity and resource,
and you squander it all.

204
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,200
It must be difficult not to be bitter.

205
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,553
Teachers simply aren't compensated
in our society.

206
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,633
I think that's why I became a life coach,
so I could instruct and command a fair fee.

207
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,394
Is there a school for that? Sign me up.

208
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,278
You're under a lot of stress.
I can see it in your face.

209
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,876
You're exhausted.
You could put groceries in those bags.

210
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,078
In fact, when you mentioned your dream
of writing earlier...

211
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,312
for a brief moment
you looked 10 years younger.

212
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,389
Dr. Troy is a world-class plastic surgeon.
Did you know that?

213
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,835
I am not
operating on that woman.

214
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,117
Even a practicing cynic like me
can't live with it. No.

215
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,952
Don't be a short-sighted fool.

216
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,634
Neither your son nor mine
can take a school suspension...

217
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,997
on their permanent record
six months before they apply to colleges.

218
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,197
They'll never be accepted
to Ivy League schools.

219
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,476
Sean will never go for it.

220
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,154
That's why I suggest
it might be better if he called you.

221
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,629
'Cause you thought
I'd be a bigger pushover?

222
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,028
Think again, sweetheart.

223
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,191
No, because you're smarter.

224
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,079
Disciplining these boys,
being a taskmaster of a parent...

225
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,310
won't correct their mistake.

226
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,353
An eye job on that fat-assed sloth will.

227
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,708
I said no.

228
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,999
You know, it boggles the mind
that after 17 years of lost opportunity...

229
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,799
you'd squander this chance
to act like a father to Matt.

230
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,520
He was doing fine until you showed up.

231
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,430
I know those drugs were yours.

232
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,879
I'm getting this boy away from you
if it's the last thing I do.

233
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,797
I love Matt. I care for him deeply.

234
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,318
And unlike you,
I'm concerned for his future.

235
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,473
You wanna protect your boy
from the true evils of the world:

236
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,870
unemployment and personal apathy?

237
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,235
Then help him get into college.

238
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,911
My 9:00 a. m. cancelled.
I can assist with the stitching up.

239
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,117
That's all right. I got it.
I got itchy hands.

240
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,195
Isn't this... What's her name?

241
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,516
The principal at Matt's school?

242
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,558
I met her last year
at parent-teacher night.

243
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,715
Why didn't I know
about this surgery?

244
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,111
Because I was hoping
that you wouldn't have to know.

245
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,992
Oh, my God, Christian.

246
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,795
You've slept with strange types,
but a 50-year-old school principal?

247
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,995
Put in on my tombstone.

248
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,436
"Here lies Christian Troy.
He was never predictable. "

249
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,159
Wait a second.
How did you meet Miss Wentworth?

250
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,790
Are you and Julia attending school
functions now, as mom and pop?

251
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,757
It's nothing
to do with Julia.

252
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,672
It's Matt.
What about Matt?

253
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,796
He got into a fight.

254
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,076
They found
prescription drugs on him.

255
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,355
They weren't his.

256
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,114
Why did Wentworth
call you instead of me?

257
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,032
Matt called.
You didn't call me?

258
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,716
Because I was trying to protect
you, Sean. I was trying to give you a break.

259
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,559
The new, improved,
compassionate Christian.

260
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,789
You are so full of shit.

261
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,317
You just want my relationship with
my son. That's why you didn't call me.

262
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,911
What was the upshot?
She wanted to suspend them.

263
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,993
But Ava convinced her
to trade plastic surgery for a clean slate.

264
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,071
Here's the new
world order, Christian.

265
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,071
You inform Matt
on how to minimize...

266
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,196
orange streaking
at spray-on tanning salons.

267
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,716
I'm in charge of all matters
concerning his education.

268
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,958
You've been standing there
the whole time?

269
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,633
No, I just walked in.

270
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,756
- Guess what I've been doing in there?
- No.

271
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,593
I'll give you a hint.
It involved my right hand.

272
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,432
You're a sociopath, you know that?

273
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,795
Come on. You'll wanna see this.

274
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,636
You didn't know I was such a Picasso,
did you?

275
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,872
That's brilliant. You think
no one's gonna know who did that now?

276
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,393
Come on.

277
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,074
I think I captured
your cum face pretty well, don't you?

278
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,629
I mean, I've seen it so many times.

279
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,991
You know, Christian put his ass
on the line...

280
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,276
to save both of us yesterday.

281
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,309
Why don't you do something nice?
Or at the very least just be grateful.

282
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,632
You're right. I should learn
to express myself in a healthier manner.

283
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,960
I think I'm just
envious of you, Matt.

284
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,276
You have two dads
that look after you.

285
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,158
I never even had one.

286
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,796
Despite what you may
wanna think, Adrian...

287
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,679
having two fathers is pretty complicated.

288
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,113
You weren't having any problems...

289
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,316
until the secret of your paternity
came out.

290
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,678
So, in a weird way, I guess you could say
we're both in this together.

291
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,713
What I'm trying to say is
maybe we should learn to get along.

292
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,555
It'd be better for everyone in the long run,
don't you think?

293
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,273
All right, then. Truce.

294
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,558
Trevor, use this one here.
That one's empty.

295
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,472
Hi, I'm Merrill...

296
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,154
- and I'm a drug addict.
- Hi, Merrill.

297
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,712
This is only my second meeting,
so I won't bore you with my...

298
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,440
tale of the cravings I've had today...

299
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,240
or how hard it is to give up the tank.

300
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,079
What I'd like to share instead
is the real reason...

301
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,630
I'm gonna kick my habit,
and get my life back on track.

302
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,794
Christian Troy, ladies and gentlemen.

303
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,035
First of all, I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for this man.

304
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,633
And by that mean, I probably
never would've lost my business...

305
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,314
and gone on drugs in the first place.

306
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,951
Seriously, though, it's because of him...

307
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,150
that I have a chance
to leave behind a life that was...

308
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,037
spinning out of control.

309
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,271
You gave me hope again.

310
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,549
And I want everyone here to know...

311
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,433
I love you, man.

312
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,471
Don't bother with that crap.

313
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,835
- Let's go grab dinner.
- I can't.

314
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,833
I got surgery in the morning.
You know how it is.

315
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,228
I used to.

316
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,151
That's okay. It's okay.

317
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,519
I had my eye on that little filly
over there anyway.

318
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,797
- I was thinking I'd ask her out.
- Which one?

319
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,519
Aren't there rules about dating people
in the group?

320
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,796
I don't wanna sleep with her, Christian.

321
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,635
I just wanna spend time with someone
who's going through what I am.

322
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,712
A friend. Now if that leads to a blow job...

323
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,072
She's coming over.

324
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,555
Hi.

325
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,713
Merrill Bobolit.

326
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,552
- You are...
- Hannah.

327
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,031
That was a touching speech
that you made earlier, Merrill.

328
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,909
Thank you. It came from the heart.
I really tried to...

329
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,470
What I was really impressed with though
was your story.

330
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,918
I really wanted to know more
about who you are.

331
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,632
This is my number.

332
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,390
I'm going for dinner
with my friends...

333
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,599
but maybe you can give me a call later,
and we can meet for coffee.

334
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,229
Maybe she's got a sister.

335
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,871
What's going on, Matty?

336
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,190
I can't help you. I'm sorry.

337
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,118
You need to call Sean.

338
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,193
I was out of the office
recuperating from surgery...

339
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,920
when this disgusting event took place.

340
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,959
The parents of the boy who washed
his hands in the urine are very upset.

341
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,998
Miss Wentworth,
I simply cannot comprehend...

342
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,835
why Matt and my son have been called
on the carpet for this juvenile prank.

343
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,560
You look 10 years younger, by the way.

344
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,873
Trevor Hayes, the student
who washed his hands in the urine...

345
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:40,636
said that Adrian and Matt were at the sink
just before the incident occurred.

346
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,758
Trevor Hayes is an unstable liar
and a crystal meth addict.

347
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:48,072
He said that you directed him
to wash his hands in the urine, Adrian.

348
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,671
Circumstantial evidence.
Come on, boys. We're going.

349
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,954
Sit down.

350
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,598
Did you urinate
in the soap dispenser, Matt?

351
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,078
This act of aggression isn't funny.
What's funny about it?

352
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,674
This whole thing is funny, Dad. It's idiotic.

353
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,752
I asked you a question, Matt.
Did you do this?

354
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,989
No.

355
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,798
Adrian, was it you?

356
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,031
He's scary, your other dad.

357
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,076
You're not leaving here
until I get an answer.

358
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,435
Don't you dare threaten my son.

359
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,034
Yeah, I urinated in the soap dispenser.

360
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,672
Do you wanna spank me?

361
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,797
Your son is yet another reminder
of what a monstrous fraud you are, Ava.

362
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,509
I'm tempted to feel sorry for him,
but I'm not his father.

363
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,268
I'm yours.

364
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,239
And here's the new regime.

365
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,551
Till further notice, you report to my office
every day after school...

366
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,156
where we'll find plenty of meaningless
busywork to keep you out of trouble.

367
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,754
- I didn't do anything.
- Yes, you did, Matt.

368
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,879
Your lackadaisical behavior screams out
for boundaries, so I'm gonna give some.

369
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,634
You will not fail to show up
or even be late.

370
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,395
Or you'll finish out your education
at a military school of my choice. Got it?

371
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,755
Matt's outgrown the saber-rattling.

372
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,673
Don't pay any attention
to his macho posturing, Matt.

373
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,559
- We can file for legal emancipation.
- You do that, lady.

374
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,518
In the two months it takes
to get the approval of the court...

375
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,069
I'll talk to the press,
discredit you as a pedophile...

376
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,629
and a kidnapper,
and an overall menace to society.

377
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,553
Then we'll see how soon
your life coach business goes belly up.

378
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,517
I'm not afraid of your empty threats.

379
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,318
You should be, Ava.

380
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,796
You should be very afraid.

381
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,229
You think you're clever now, don't you?

382
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,833
Where are they?

383
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,231
- Where are what?
- I get out of the shower.

384
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,516
I go to get dressed,
but my closet, dresser...

385
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,911
my laundry bag are completely empty
all of a sudden.

386
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,919
It's official, Adrian. You've gone insane.

387
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,029
Where are they?

388
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,316
Come in and see for yourself.

389
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,196
Adrian, this is Alfonso Tehon Jr.
You may have met in passing.

390
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,113
His father's been cleaning our pool
for the last four years.

391
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,716
- Are you wearing my shirt, dude?
- And pants. Shoes, too.

392
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,955
Fortunately, you two
are almost the same size.

393
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,396
And he doesn't speak English,
so don't try and make a scene right now.

394
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,916
- Why is he wearing my clothes, Mother?
- He deserves them more than you.

395
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,196
You know he and his father
came to this country...

396
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,669
from El Salvador five years ago
with no money?

397
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,751
To help out, Alfonso works two jobs.

398
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,150
You, on the other hand,
are a spoiled only child...

399
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,038
who's gotten everything he's ever wanted.

400
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,430
And never appreciated any of it.

401
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,479
The fact that you continue
to act out at school is unacceptable.

402
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,717
I've realized that maybe Sean is right.

403
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,072
Maybe good, old-fashioned discipline
is in order.

404
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,598
So as punishment,
I've given away your clothes.

405
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,274
Ava, what is he gonna wear to school?

406
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,509
You should find something
at the Goodwill for this.

407
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,636
They open in half an hour.

408
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,838
Could you give Alfonso a hand
with these bags out to my car?

409
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,389
I promised to give him a ride home.

410
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,799
- Sure.
- Thanks.

411
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,476
So now the pool man's son
deserves more than I do.

412
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,598
From now on, you do what I say,
when I say it.

413
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,317
You stop jeopardizing
my relationship with Matt...

414
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,476
or you will pay the price.

415
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,119
Tell me what you don't like
about yourself, Ms. Navez.

416
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,032
That I'm not Jennifer.

417
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,719
You know, J. Lo. I wanna look like J. Lo.

418
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,436
- May I ask why?
- Because her life is better than mine.

419
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,516
Are you saying
that you'd like a larger backside?

420
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,389
No. I've already got that.
It's the rest that I wanna change.

421
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:27,473
I wanna change my face, my breasts.
I wanna do some lipo around my waist...

422
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,359
so I can wear clothes
from the J. Lo collection.

423
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,431
And I can stand a lot of pain...

424
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,036
so don't worry,
you can just do it all at once.

425
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,954
Ms. Navez, unfortunately,
we are not in the business...

426
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,475
of celebrity look-alike makeovers.

427
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,433
We'll leave that to MTV.

428
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,637
You're in the business
of helping people, right?

429
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,516
I mean, everyone who meets me says
that I could have a big career like J. Lo's...

430
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,750
if I looked more like her.

431
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,230
You're an attractive young lady.
Clearly motivated.

432
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,912
You don't need to be J. Lo.

433
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,718
You can't be J. Lo.

434
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,514
You're you.

435
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,638
Don't you get it?

436
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,751
I mean, I'm not enough.

437
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,550
I mean, all I get is rejections.

438
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,596
Ms. Navez, the kind of facial
reconstruction you're talking about...

439
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,910
would require quite a few procedures.

440
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,117
Rhinoplasty, malar implants
to augment your cheekbones...

441
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:26,956
- dermabrasion for the slight acne scars...
- Mentoplasty for more chin definition.

442
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,794
And maybe some lipo from your abdomen.

443
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,033
The procedures we just outlined...

444
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,317
would cost somewhere
in the neighborhood of $50,000.

445
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,391
Yeah, I figured that.

446
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,999
I'll pay you back when I make it.

447
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,515
I'm sorry. I don't wanna waste
any more of your time.

448
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,195
We only take on pro bono work
if it's life-threatening in some way...

449
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,999
- which, in your case, I'm afraid...
- It is life-threatening.

450
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,754
It's everything that I've worked for
for my entire life.

451
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,797
I have so much to offer.

452
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,632
I wanna touch
people's hearts.

453
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,349
But the world won't let me
because I'm stuck in this body.

454
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,873
It's Merrill. Where the hell are you?

455
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,793
It's a sponsor session.
You are my sponsor.

456
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,154
I can't be around these people
without you right now.

457
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,588
You okay?
Yeah.

458
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,875
You don't look so good.

459
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,873
Yeah, I know.
Christian was supposed to meet me here.

460
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,158
Oh, God, what a sexy man,
and a plastic surgeon.

461
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,949
Can you imagine
the life that he must have?

462
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,271
What was I thinking,
trying to make a play for him?

463
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,830
I mean, really. What successful person
like that wants to hang out...

464
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,037
with a bunch of losers like us? Right?

465
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,032
Correct me if I'm wrong, Sean.

466
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,316
I was under the impression
that, as partners...

467
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,519
we'd discuss pro bono cases
before we made a decision either way.

468
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,239
When they're viable cases.

469
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,630
Since when is work
on the lunatic fringe...

470
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,631
even up for discussion?

471
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,072
How's the air up there, partner?

472
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,356
Got a touch of the high and mighty,
do we?

473
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,714
Speaking of discussion...

474
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,793
did I misplace my invitation
to discuss Miss Wentworth's eye job?

475
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,994
Felicia Navez is not suffering
from a medical condition or disfigurement.

476
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,355
She's just suffering from
a fatal case of envy.

477
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,671
It's not her fault that she was born
into a celebrity-obsessed world.

478
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,910
All this kid needs
is a simple confidence boost.

479
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,479
You slammed the door on even that.

480
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,315
Becoming other people
does not lead to personal fulfillment.

481
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,510
Once upon a time in college,
I had a dream.

482
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,429
I met a guy I admired,
and I said I wanted to be like him.

483
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,110
I'm partners with him today.

484
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,358
Where's the harm?

485
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,789
Looking more
and more like J. Lo.

486
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,073
Hey, Bubblehead,
slow down with that thing!

487
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,518
Stop complaining
and join the party already.

488
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,678
Don't you think
you've taken enough out of her?

489
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,592
I know what I'm doing.

490
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,789
Bobolit!

491
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,675
Come on, you're a doctor. Help me!

492
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,395
Shit!

493
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,113
- Come on, Doctor, do something!
- Shut up!

494
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,914
She's dead?

495
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,955
No way.

496
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,276
Everything was going fine.

497
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,759
Hold her legs.

498
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,239
Hold her legs.

499
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,395
What are you doing?

500
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,597
We can get rid of her easier
if she's in pieces.

501
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,634
How's it going in here?

502
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,634
When I'm done with the towels,
I'll go and unpack the surgical supplies.

503
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,028
Excellent.

504
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,795
You know, the drawers and the shelves
are looking a little grungy, Dad.

505
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,188
I'll come in tomorrow...

506
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,113
clear everything out,
and give them a good scrub.

507
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,713
I don't get it.

508
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,475
Where's the sullen backtalk
I've been bracing myself for?

509
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,313
I don't know.

510
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,193
I guess I kind of like hanging out here.

511
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,118
Do you remember when I was little...

512
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,555
you used to bring me in here
on the weekends...

513
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,915
to feed the fish in your office?

514
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,835
Yeah.

515
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,994
Dad, the Marlins are on tonight...

516
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,119
so I was thinking
I could pick us up a pizza...

517
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,475
come by, watch it at the house.

518
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,354
I mean, if you don't have any plans.

519
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,633
No. No plans.

520
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,273
That'd be fine.

521
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,998
Where are you off to?

522
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,077
What are you doing here?

523
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,392
I thought you'd be at the meeting today.

524
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,313
I left you a message.
My surgery went late.

525
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,394
I called you repeatedly,
but you never called me back.

526
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,034
I was afraid you might have relapsed.

527
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,911
- You got high again, didn't you?
- And loved every minute of it.

528
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,753
It's the only reliable thing in my life.

529
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,438
What happened here?

530
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:22,036
- Why is there so much blood on the table?
- It's all your fault, you know!

531
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,671
If you'd just showed up at the meeting,
this wouldn't have happened to her.

532
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,870
What's in the suitcase, Merrill?

533
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,835
We're gonna need another suitcase.

534
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,433
Hey, sponsor.

535
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,079
What are you doing, Merrill?

536
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,949
You know the difference
between jealousy and envy, Christian?

537
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,194
Jealousy is when you realize
someone has something you want...

538
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,591
and you just have to work hard to get it.

539
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:17,276
Envy is when you realize someone
has something you can never have...

540
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,631
no matter how hard you try.

541
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,511
Take me and you, for example.

542
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,353
We both graduated from
the same school...

543
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,678
created successful businesses...

544
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,192
found money, fame...

545
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,949
pussy...

546
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,990
but somehow you managed
to always come out ahead of me.

547
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,791
Staring down at you,
I suddenly realize why.

548
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,230
It's that handsome mug of yours.

549
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,189
- Where's Madam Rose?
- She got freaked out by all the gore.

550
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,998
She's probably in Tampa by now.

551
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,833
What are you planning on doing, Merrill?

552
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,036
Something I've always dreamed of.

553
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,714
I figure if I can't have your life...

554
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,431
I'll just take your face.

555
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,513
Stop struggling. I will cut your throat.

556
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,756
It'll never work, Merrill.

557
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,589
Why not?

558
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,114
Facial transplant surgery
has never been done successfully.

559
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,989
You're just wasting your time.
You don't think I can do it?

560
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,234
I'm a great goddamn surgeon, Christian!

561
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,638
You're just trying
to break my concentration.

562
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,393
I just don't want you to forget
the most important part, that's all.

563
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,154
You have to expose the live tissue
on your face first.

564
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,279
I knew that.

565
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,029
I figured I could do me later.

566
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,876
The nerve endings on my face will be dead
before you have a chance to reattach.

567
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,951
You really wanna be me?

568
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,718
That's what I'd do.

569
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,678
Goodbye, Merrill.

570
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,238
I don't feel so good.

571
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,993
Hello?
In here!

572
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,310
Appointment
to do my breast implants.

573
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,391
In here, please! Help me!

574
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,196
Adrian, why are you sitting in the dark?

575
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,200
I won't let you do this to me anymore.

576
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,797
Please don't threaten me, Adrian.

577
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,758
Why do you keep hurting me?
Do you enjoy it?

578
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,876
I'm giving you what you need.

579
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,190
It may not be what you want.

580
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,474
I need you.

581
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,918
That's what I need.

582
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,319
I'm so humiliated. I've been such a prick.

583
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,397
Living here with you and Matt
just hurts too much.

584
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,310
How do I make you love me again?

585
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,871
I will always love you.

586
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,879
Things change.

587
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,190
We both need to accept that.

588
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,636
It can't ever be like it was.

589
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,078
I gave you my soul.

590
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,032
No. No more.

591
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,237
Please, Mommy. Please.

592
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,749
