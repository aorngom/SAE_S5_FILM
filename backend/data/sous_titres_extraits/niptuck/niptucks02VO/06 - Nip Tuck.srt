00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,678
<i>Previously on Nip / Tuck:</i>

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,674
I'd never heard of a life coach
before you walked in.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,155
It's a growing alternative.
A good one, I think.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,517
Sean, this has been going on
since that whole Henry thing.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,433
I think Matt needs to talk to someone.
Maybe Ava.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,672
Tell me that a new son is going to replace
the one that I lost.

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,478
I feel dead inside.

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,915
You already have a son, Christian.

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,638
With me.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,069
Matt.

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,834
Hey.

12
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,909
- You okay?
- Yeah. Allergies.

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,917
But you don't have allergies.

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,073
I know, but friends usually take that
as a cue to leave you alone.

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,395
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,632
I'm just a little sensitive.
I've been taking these hormones.

17
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,552
You going through menopause?

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,997
No, Sean. As a matter of fact,
I'm trying to get pregnant.

19
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,793
I had no idea.

20
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,957
Of course, the folks down at
the South Dade Fertility Center think...

21
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,352
I should come back after I've considered
the thousand and one potential risks...

22
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,272
of a middle-aged pregnancy.

23
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,716
I've got plenty of eggs.
They just won't let me fertilize them.

24
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,316
Whoa, Medusa's going to breed.
Alert the eugenics police.

25
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,992
Hey, I'm all for it.
With today's medical advances...

26
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,516
there's no reason our healthy seniors
shouldn't be having babies.

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,478
Think of all the savings you could share.
Diapers, day-care...

28
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,198
yummy jars of strained peas.

29
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,509
Asshole.

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,279
Look, she's in denial about her age and
needs someone to help her see the truth.

31
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,634
Glass houses, Christian.

32
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,075
It's easier to joke
about other people's suffering...

33
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,389
than admit you're hurting.

34
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,074
You really need
to stop reading Julia's magazines.

35
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,754
Fine.
Keep the pain and frustration inside...

36
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,873
until it eats a hole in your gut
and you're stuck with a bleeding ulcer.

37
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,235
It's not going to bring back your son.

38
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,234
No fair. They let him get pregnant.

39
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,558
Okay, kids,
let's suck the fat out of Mr. Gross.

40
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,838
Actually, Mr. Gross has requested
an otoplasty.

41
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,311
He's getting his ears pinned,
and he didn't discuss the rest of him?

42
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,075
The rest of him apparently didn't
affect his negative self-image.

43
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,074
He's a heart attack waiting to happen.
These people who'd rather live in denial...

44
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,152
and endanger their lives
than face the truth about themselves...

45
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,151
where the hell do we find them?

46
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,151
Mrs. Broderick,
tell me what you don't like about yourself.

47
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,277
My God. What a question.

48
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,070
BOBBl: There's nothing
I particularly dislike about myself.

49
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,638
Not that there's anything about me
that's so wonderful.

50
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,472
Well, except for my boys.

51
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,874
I did bring up two incredible kids.

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,797
That's nice. What I meant was...

53
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,791
BOBBl: Do you have children,
Dr. McNamara?

54
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,518
Yes. Two.

55
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,191
Enjoy them while you can.
Before you know it, they'll be...

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,956
marrying some East Indian...

57
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,112
and sending you
a "Happy Janmashtami" card once a year.

58
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,190
Mrs. Broderick...

59
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,035
And at least now I can
get out of the house...

60
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,395
and back into the working world...

61
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,075
and do something. I mean,
not that being a mother isn't something.

62
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,198
It's just that, you know,
when someone asks me what I do...

63
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,954
and I tell them I'm a wife and a mother...

64
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,873
the lights in their eyes just go out.

65
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,436
BOBBl: Anyway,
a friend of my daughter-in-law's...

66
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,149
who is the head of personnel,
you know, at Saks...

67
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,118
She told me about an opening in sales...

68
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,353
and if there's one thing I know,
it's clothes.

69
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,750
I've been wearing them all my life.

70
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,438
Unfortunately,
I'll be competing with girls...

71
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,589
my sons' ages...

72
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,955
who haven't had two Caesareans.

73
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,516
Well, that's why I'm here.

74
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,754
My tummy.

75
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,991
Mrs. Broderick,
I think you look great for your age.

76
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,754
They're not hiring "great for my age. "

77
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,635
I can't look like some housewife
who's trying to fill up her day.

78
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,239
The only way I'm going to get this job
is if those clothes look as good on me...

79
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,233
as they do on those young ladies
I'll be up against.

80
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,839
There are certain guidelines
you'll have to follow.

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,549
No nicotine use, avoid excessive tanning,
keep exercising, that sort of thing.

82
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,472
You'll have to be
a weight you can maintain.

83
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,313
I'll maintain it
if it means cutting off my leg.

84
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,072
Here's the consent form.

85
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,676
It explains the potential risks involved
with this procedure.

86
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,876
Take it home, read it.
If you have any questions...

87
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,112
I'll just sign it.
I can freak out pretty easily.

88
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,752
Once I read the side of an aspirin bottle,
and I was convinced...

89
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,434
that my headache was
bleeding in the brain.

90
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,149
Endorphins are nature's
antidepressants, and they work...

91
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,834
whether or not
you're getting a runner's high.

92
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,315
Which I'm guessing you're not.

93
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,190
Goddamn, that really hurts.

94
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,478
It's a side cramp.

95
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,200
Your muscles aren't used to
releasing lactic acid.

96
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,588
Here.

97
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,311
Make sure you breathe out fully.

98
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,914
Small breaths in, deep breaths out.

99
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,795
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

100
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,509
No, don't apologize. Release is good.

101
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,111
- Want to talk about it?
- No.

102
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,509
I'm afraid this is one of those situations
that's better in than out.

103
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,112
How's the runner's cramp?

104
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,755
Gone.

105
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,597
We don't have to suffer
as much as we think we do.

106
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,713
When I was in college,
about 17 years ago...

107
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,233
I did something I shouldn't have done...

108
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,516
and I never told anyone up until recently.

109
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,596
I opened a Pandora's box.

110
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,593
I just couldn't take it. The not knowing.

111
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,918
Not knowing what?

112
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,149
I shouldn't have brought it up. Come on.

113
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,269
You know what was left in Pandora's box
once the evil escaped?

114
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,029
Hope.

115
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,154
Listen, I was wondering.

116
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,239
Do you think you could give
the coaching thing another try?

117
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,550
- I was hoping you'd ask.
- For Matt, I mean.

118
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,797
His grades have dropped,
he doesn't study anymore.

119
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,513
All right.
Tell him to call me for an appointment.

120
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,634
Or better yet.

121
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,519
He's a teenager. I'll call him.

122
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,594
Thanks.

123
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,393
Let's see.

124
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,189
War, famine, disaster.

125
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,235
Second panda born in captivity.

126
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,237
Remember a few years ago
when that boy fell through the guard-rail...

127
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,391
at the Miami Metro Zoo and hit his head?

128
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,678
And the female gorilla scooped him up
and rocked him until medical help arrived?

129
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,149
Mocking my efforts to get pregnant
is one thing...

130
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,356
but comparing me to Koko, the gorilla?

131
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,909
Relax. You're just the sister
I never got to torture.

132
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,277
We're not family, Christian.
We're not even the same subspecies.

133
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,671
Neither were Koko and that little boy,
but look at them.

134
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,230
You don't have to give birth to a child
in order to love it.

135
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,992
Look.
I understand how you must be feeling...

136
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,957
after losing Wilber.

137
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,599
But this is different.

138
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,309
I've always wanted
to feel life grow inside me.

139
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,756
Then why did you wait
until it became a risk for both of you?

140
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,796
My father hadn't died yet.

141
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,151
When he found out I was gay,
he told my mother:

142
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,876
"At least there won't be any kids. "

143
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,271
I'm surprised you didn't get knocked up
right away just to show him.

144
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,839
That's why I waited.

145
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,874
I didn't want to have this baby
out of spite.

146
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,232
This baby and I...

147
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,317
we're going to be a family.

148
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,400
We're going to love each other
no matter what.

149
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,275
Look, that clinic?
If they give you any more trouble...

150
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,116
I mean, if you're looking
for an alternate source...

151
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,313
Hey, I got way more
than I'll ever be able to use.

152
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,833
I'm confused.

153
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,076
We maybe...

154
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,516
have one civil interaction
every other leap year.

155
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,314
And now you're offering me your sperm?

156
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,834
It's you or the toilet.

157
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,798
Okay, this conversation
should have ended at Koko.

158
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,673
Seriously.

159
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,517
It's a great feeling.

160
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,958
Being a parent.

161
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,949
I wouldn't want you to miss out on that.

162
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,151
I have to think about it.

163
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,478
We're talking turkey baster, right?

164
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,154
Well, I'm sure in hell
not sleeping with you.

165
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,159
Am I interrupting something?

166
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,118
Yes. I'm about have an aneurysm.

167
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,715
Christian is offering me his sperm.

168
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,714
- To courage.
- Why to courage?

169
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,156
Because it took a lion's courage
for you to ring my doorbell.

170
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,793
Yeah. But the lion was my mother.

171
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,512
This is a nice place.

172
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,671
I don't think my mother would approve
of me drinking during therapy.

173
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,990
- Do you?
- It isn't therapy.

174
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,236
And your mother isn't here.

175
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,109
I should go.

176
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,238
But this is your moment
to become a man, Matt.

177
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,119
You're so close.

178
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,998
It'd be a shame to blow it.

179
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,149
I'm sorry?

180
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,630
A man is someone who isn't afraid
to stand naked in his truth.

181
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,472
Don't be afraid of what
you came over here to tell me.

182
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,678
I didn't come over here
to tell you anything.

183
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,232
I don't even know you.

184
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,996
Okay, then let's do a trust exercise.

185
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,309
You ask me to do something
that could hurt me if I didn't trust you.

186
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,109
Then you know you can trust me. Sit.

187
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,997
Say what you're feeling.

188
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,714
Okay.

189
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,353
You want me to stand naked in my truth?

190
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,395
You get naked, and I'll get naked.

191
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,715
Now we have to make it dangerous.

192
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,435
Take a picture. It'll be your proof.

193
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,952
You could show it to anyone,
but I trust you not to.

194
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,675
Now all we have to do is wait.

195
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,750
It's a trust game, Matt. Not a sex game.

196
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,959
I trusted you. Now you trust me.

197
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,115
It's okay, Matt. Let it out.

198
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,472
Me and my friend Henry got high.

199
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,711
We were driving stoned.

200
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,759
And we hit her.

201
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,115
We hit a girl, and we left her.

202
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,558
I didn't want
a fancy new stove, but he insisted.

203
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,109
For our
25th wedding anniversary.

204
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,759
And the stove was defective?

205
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,798
When I went to light it, it just erupted.

206
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,439
It took off my hair, my eyelashes.

207
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,556
I had third-degree burns.

208
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,316
<i>And my lips were just burned to a crisp.</i>

209
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,395
After they cooled off,
doctors had to peel them off like...

210
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,753
Fruit Roll-Ups.

211
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,399
Sounds very painful.

212
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,915
Yeah, it wasn't pleasant,
I can tell you that.

213
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,437
Mrs. Caldarello, we've had tremendous
success in lip reconstruction...

214
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,195
using the patient's labial folds
as donor sites.

215
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,599
Labial? That means lips, right?

216
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,389
That's right. Your other lips.

217
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,278
You've got two pair.

218
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,719
Oh, my God.

219
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,959
Are you out of your mind?

220
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,759
I'm not putting those on my face.

221
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,710
They're only skin, dermis.

222
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,429
<i>From my loaca? Forget it.</i>

223
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,956
- There's really no other option.
- What about when my husband kisses me?

224
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,272
Don't worry, he won't be able to tell where
it's from because of texture or fragrance.

225
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,637
If he finds out, he'll never kiss me again.

226
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,157
- You mean he doesn't like...
- He's never tried it.

227
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,630
He's old school. Sicilian.

228
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,270
Men like him
think it's a weakness...

229
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,715
to satisfy a woman in that way.

230
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,109
Mrs. Caldarello, if your husband wants
sexual relations at the end of a long day...

231
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,634
do you ever say no?

232
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,076
Of course not. I want to make him happy.

233
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,030
What about your happiness?
The secret joy of knowing...

234
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,354
that it's the first time
those lips will have ever been kissed?

235
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,588
After she talked it over honestly
with her husband, of course.

236
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,789
Do it.

237
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,754
Put my pussy on my lips.

238
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,872
What he doesn't know, he doesn't know.

239
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,595
Then, if he asks...

240
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,675
you got it from my breasts.

241
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,110
Those, he can't get enough of.

242
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,632
Matt, I only see people by appointment,
like a doctor.

243
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,392
Come on.
I mean it.

244
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,074
This is a professional relationship.

245
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,637
So is this what you do?

246
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:56,190
You get people to open up and spill
their guts so you can stomp all over them?

247
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,431
Look,
we need to establish some boundaries.

248
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:06,076
What, I'm supposed to believe
that you get naked with all your clients?

249
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,632
That this was
just some stupid trust exercise?

250
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,956
Look. I made a commitment
to your mother to help you.

251
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,195
I don't take my commitments lightly,
Matt.

252
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,477
Look me in the eyes
and tell me you're not attracted to me.

253
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,119
I am attracted to you.

254
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,469
But your mother hired me
as your life coach, not your geisha.

255
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,672
Do you have any idea what it's like...

256
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,354
going around all day
with a constant hard-on?

257
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,034
You want some relief?
Give me an A in French.

258
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,309
You're offering me sex for grades?

259
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,632
Just trying to help you
get your life back on track.

260
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,877
Come on, there's no way I can go
from a C to an A.

261
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,232
Then there's no way
I can relieve your suffering.

262
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,878
It's amazing
what a little incentive can do.

263
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,594
<i>Au revoir.</i>

264
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,990
I can't believe we're sucking
a teabag of fat...

265
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,230
out of a woman
who's as skinny as a Twizzler.

266
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,757
We're sculpting localized fat deposits that
can't be controlled by diet and exercise.

267
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,070
As Mrs. Broderick attained
her ideal weight...

268
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,629
she's a perfect candidate
for the procedure.

269
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,997
I think she's even thinner
than when she came in for her consult.

270
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,392
I was thinking
about accepting Christian's sperm.

271
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,232
Come on, Liz.
That's your desperation talking.

272
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,676
Damn straight. I can't listen
to another lab technician tell me...

273
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,354
my child's going to look
like some Diane Arbus photo.

274
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,308
There's enough conflict in this office
without adding domestic warfare to it.

275
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,074
Women pay top dollar
for medical students' sperm.

276
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,232
I've got grade-A doctor DNA for free.

277
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,153
When it involves Christian,
it's never a bargain.

278
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,551
Who took Alegra Caldarello
off the schedule?

279
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,790
I moved a rhinoplasty to get her in.

280
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,475
I wanted to sit on it.

281
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,995
Sit on it?
The woman has no lips.

282
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,029
I'm uncomfortable
about lying to her husband.

283
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,158
It would be like me lying to Julia,
or lying to you.

284
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,670
He's not your patient. She is.
We're simply protecting her privacy.

285
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,990
Protecting her privacy
or keeping her secrets?

286
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,118
You're such a goddamn moralist.
We lie, Sean.

287
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,558
We keep secrets in order
to protect the people that we love.

288
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,475
Husbands, wives, children, friends.
Even strangers. Shit.

289
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,990
If Anne Frank had been hiding
in your attic...

290
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,879
she wouldn't have
got past the words "Dear Diary. "

291
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,274
I'm putting pussy lips back
on the schedule.

292
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,394
You wanna tell us
what the hell you're doing?

293
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,399
Thanks for coming.

294
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,310
Don't worry,
this won't happen again.

295
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,916
It better not.
Next time, he'll be charged as an adult.

296
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,195
Holy shit.

297
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,950
That was like being abducted by aliens.

298
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,789
You keep that up and you'll find out
what it's like to be anally probed...

299
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,474
by some lifer
who wants to make you his bitch!

300
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,950
Come on, what are they gonna do,
arrest every kid who jacks off?

301
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,152
Your mommy didn't just catch you
in the bathroom, Matt.

302
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,477
You were beating off in public.

303
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,438
Once you are branded a sex offender,
it stays with you.

304
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,114
I'm screwing up my future. I got it.

305
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,190
But it wasn't all my fault.
Oh, right.

306
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,277
Like someone made you whack off?

307
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,719
You haven't seen her.
She is unbelievably hot.

308
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,474
You're going to jail
for some hot piece of teenage ass?

309
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,599
She's not a teenage piece of ass.
She's your age, okay?

310
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,356
She's the life coach Mom hired
to get my grades up.

311
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,797
Your grades, asshole, not your dick!

312
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,314
You stay away from her!

313
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,597
Oh, yeah, right, like you don't think
older women are hot?

314
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,953
Isn't that why you slept
with my grandmother?

315
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,354
Man, I don't even recognize you.

316
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,590
<i>Where's the guy who got me drunk
when I was 13?</i>

317
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,910
Where's the guy
who took me to that strip club?

318
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,799
Where's the guy
who bought me my first rubber?

319
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,598
Who the hell are you?

320
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,072
You're never to see her again.
Do you understand me?

321
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,148
Here's a little update for you, Christian.
I already have a father.

322
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,557
And I don't need another one.

323
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,595
I just think it's lovely
you're such an integral part of his life.

324
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,035
Growing up's so complicated now.

325
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,995
We could all use a protective eye.

326
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,549
Thanks. And I'm his godfather.

327
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,357
His godfather? Really?

328
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,269
I went to college with his parents.

329
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,749
We're all pretty close.

330
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,397
And I'm in business with his father.
Troy-McNamara.

331
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,354
- So that was what, 20 years ago?
- Seventeen.

332
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,711
Well, he's very lucky
that you're watching out over him.

333
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,678
Dr. Troy, you do understand...

334
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,070
that my work with Matt
is strictly confidential.

335
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,471
- If there's anything in particular...
- He's in love with you.

336
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:38,033
I encourage transference.
It's instrumental in bringing about change.

337
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,313
He was caught masturbating
outside your window.

338
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,751
Is that part of transference, too?

339
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,636
He's young, and very sweet.

340
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,550
You think what he's doing is sweet?

341
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,711
Look, you're a bright, beautiful woman.

342
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,032
You have a certain allure to a kid
who's still at an impressionable age.

343
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,114
You may be
underestimating your effect on him.

344
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,994
- He's immature. I'll talk to him.
- Good.

345
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,796
And if there's anyone else you could
recommend for him to see...

346
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,154
Why would I do that?

347
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,595
You won't work with him
after what I told you?

348
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,910
Dr. Troy,
I'm trying to rid him of his shame...

349
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,230
encourage him
to get in touch with his feelings...

350
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,277
including his sexual impulses.

351
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,590
His attraction to me is normal,
as mine is to him.

352
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,436
And mutually advantageous.

353
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,716
He makes me feel 10 years younger.

354
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,395
You wanna feel younger, try BOTOX,
not a 17-year-old kid.

355
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,511
I had no idea you were so puritanical.

356
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,558
I'm a goddamn Pilgrim.
Have you slept with him?

357
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,676
I told you, that's confidential.

358
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,638
You'll have to find some other fantasy
to help you get it up.

359
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,552
I'll have you arrested for statutory rape.

360
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,234
He's 17.
In Florida, that's a consenting adult.

361
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,674
You sure know your rape law.

362
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,230
As someone who, according to Matt,
has had their share of teenage girls...

363
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,072
you're stupid if you don't.

364
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,957
I'm sure Julia will be very interested
to hear what parts of life...

365
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,155
you're coaching her son in.

366
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,632
And I'm sure Sean will be very interested
to know who Matt's real father is.

367
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,350
I don't know what you're talking about.

368
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,635
Don't you?

369
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,115
- Julia would never...
- She didn't need to.

370
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,916
The resemblance is quite obvious.

371
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,274
Of course, we rarely believe what we see
when we don't wanna see it.

372
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,753
It's still very early.
You should call the office...

373
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,230
if you notice any additional drainage
from the incision site.

374
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,231
But other than that, we're right on course.

375
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,755
Wow.

376
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,392
This would not make a very good
"after" picture.

377
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,433
BOBBl: Looks like I've been in
a car accident or something.

378
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,114
The bruising will go away
in a couple of weeks.

379
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,919
Minor puckering at the incision
is not uncommon.

380
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,110
There were no pictures like this
in the brochures you gave me.

381
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,197
If it's still there in a few weeks...

382
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,079
we'll take care of it
using a local in the office.

383
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,076
You didn't say anything
about a second surgery.

384
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,390
If it's still there,
which I'm sure it won't be.

385
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,711
What happened to "liposuction is
the most common procedure"?

386
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,394
It's not unusual
for patients to come in for a touch-up.

387
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,870
It's not like those TV shows
where everything's perfect after surgery.

388
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,669
- No bruising, no need for a period of...
- No, you should have warned me.

389
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,832
You know,
I have a job interview in 10 days.

390
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,989
I can't afford to go through this again.

391
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,591
Give it time.
Everyone heals at their own...

392
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,274
Time is what I don't have, Doctor.

393
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,676
I thought you understood that.

394
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,639
This is it. This is my shot.

395
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,798
God, look at me.

396
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,039
How many more chances
do you think I'm gonna get?

397
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,159
There's no winner.
You're gonna give yourself a heart tack.

398
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,199
Promise? I hate this place.

399
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,196
Come on, we're lucky. State of the art,
five minutes from the office.

400
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,909
Look around. It's like
Planet of the Botched Boob Jobs.

401
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,557
Maybe we should set up a kiosk.

402
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,473
Listen,
why don't you come over after this?

403
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,155
Break bread with the family.
We all miss you, especially the kids.

404
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,631
Thanks, but I'm not up for family night.

405
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,598
What I need is
an evening of synchronized screwing.

406
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,189
So you can numb your pain
for a couple of hours?

407
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,590
Maybe instead of a child,
you need a relationship.

408
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,274
Not everyone is lucky to find a woman...

409
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,789
who can get them hard
physically and mentally, Sean.

410
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,030
<i>I want someone
whose company I can stand...</i>

411
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,395
once her mouth is free of obstruction.

412
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,233
Guess what I found.

413
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,312
I'm not sure I want to know.

414
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,199
Your ideal woman.

415
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,070
In there?
She must be awfully tiny.

416
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,956
I want you to meet her.
She's beauty and brains in one package.

417
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,197
Forget it. I'm not interested.

418
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,510
Too late. She's actually here.

419
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,834
Christian Troy, Ava Moore.

420
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,032
Nice to meet you, Christian.

421
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,477
Well, I should go. I have a patient.

422
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,874
- By the way, I'm thrilled about Matt.
- What about him?

423
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,316
He got an A on his French midterm.
Before seeing Ava he was getting Cs.

424
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,311
She's an incredible motivator.

425
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,876
What the hell are you doing here?

426
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,316
Just wanted to see the expression
on your face when you saw me.

427
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,471
Definitely worth the trip.

428
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,750
Look...

429
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,475
We're not that different, you and I.

430
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,353
- And I think we owe Matt a chance.
- To do what?

431
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,513
To become an adult without us
screwing him up. He's a good kid.

432
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,273
He deserves better.

433
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,388
How about I make a deal with you?

434
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,959
- I'm listening.
- Have me instead.

435
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,072
You won't be disappointed.

436
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,237
Age has its advantages.

437
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,874
But with youth,
you get to touch the future.

438
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,999
As a teacher,
that's the best part of my job.

439
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,038
Get out of my office.

440
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,072
You have to shoot me first.

441
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,392
With BOTOX.
I have a hot date with a young man.

442
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,832
So I'm taking your advice.

443
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,709
You trust me with a needle full of poison
aimed at your forehead?

444
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,950
With the information I've got on you...

445
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,396
now is not the time or place
to deny me anything.

446
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,950
Two cc's
is what's usually recommended.

447
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,634
However, it does vary
from person to person.

448
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,831
<i>And it has been known to interfere...</i>

449
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,391
with the patient's ability to eat,
blink and speak.

450
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,556
But I'm sure you'll be fine.

451
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,795
Don't worry about Sean.
I'll tell him we lacked chemistry.

452
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,874
<i>I'll say you were arrogant, banal...</i>

453
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,550
and in my opinion,
simply not ready for a mature relationship.

454
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,394
Good. The incisions are healing nicely.

455
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,392
No signs of infection.

456
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,710
They look so pink and smooth.

457
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,797
Like before they got all wrinkly
from smoking cigarettes.

458
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,397
It's hard to believe you can take skin
from down there and put it on her face.

459
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,717
I'm delighted you told him,
Mrs. Caldarello.

460
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,156
Well, of course. I wanted him to know
when he kissed me...

461
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,278
he'd be kissing the skin
from behind my knee.

462
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,910
He always used to tickle me there.

463
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,196
<i>The first time
I saw The Pieta...</i>

464
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,155
you could feel the smoothness
of the Madonna's lips.

465
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,353
That's how I feel
when I look at my Madonna.

466
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,550
When can I kiss her?
She keeps saying to ask you.

467
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,472
All of a sudden he's in such a hurry.

468
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,437
They just look so pink!

469
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,750
That's really up to your wife.

470
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,480
Whenever she feels comfortable.

471
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,476
So soft and smooth.
Even better than before.

472
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:28,077
I had lunch with a couple of my
gay friends, Mark and his partner Jeff.

473
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,514
We've been friends for years, so...

474
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,110
I figured I'd ask them
about becoming sperm donors.

475
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,994
Makes sense.

476
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,194
- I'm not insulted.
- They turned me down.

477
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,548
Apparently they'd feel more comfortable
with a younger lesbian.

478
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,717
Age doesn't necessarily ensure
a healthy child.

479
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,388
That's what I told them.

480
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,075
Then they quoted me statistics
and stuck me with the bill.

481
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:08,355
Funny how you turn out to be the guy
who shows up when you need him.

482
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,230
So...

483
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,550
I'd like to accept your offer,
if it's still good.

484
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,637
Good while supplies last.

485
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,110
There was just nothing more I could do.

486
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,556
Honey, I don't recall
us inviting Christian to join us.

487
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,396
You're right.
I'm like a pathological rescuer.

488
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,636
- Besides, if Ava can't get through to him...
- He met Ava?

489
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,152
I invited her to the office.
I thought they'd hit it off.

490
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,076
You fixed him up at work?
What happened?

491
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,279
Not much.
Apparently they lacked chemistry.

492
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,790
BOBBl: Dr. McNamara!
Who's that?

493
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,553
A patient.
Bobbi, what are you doing here?

494
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,958
I followed you. You and your lovely wife.

495
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,553
I don't mean to ruin your night out,
but I wanted to thank you publicly.

496
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,268
For this.

497
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,111
BOBBl: Isn't it fabulous, ladies?

498
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,318
Liposuction by Dr. Sean McNamara.

499
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,711
<i>Of McNamara/Troy.
Call any time for an appointment.</i>

500
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,474
<i>But don't forget to read the fine print...</i>

501
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,518
because he sure as hell
won't tell you about it.

502
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,271
This has nothing to do with me.
Obviously, you've had a sudden weight...

503
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,318
Don't you dare try to twist this around
like it's my fault.

504
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,471
You never bothered
to explain the risks to me!

505
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,552
BOBBl: You didn't want to waste the time,
I wasn't important to you.

506
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,792
- Excuse me, ma'am, I'm gonna have to...
- I'll go when he apologizes.

507
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,509
- This man ruined my career.
- Career? You had a job interview.

508
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,520
You never took me seriously, did you?

509
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,430
I was just a middle-aged nothing.

510
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,716
There was nothing wrong
with that liposuction.

511
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,313
You wanna come to my office, talk...

512
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,871
No, Dr. McNamara, you come
to my lawyer's office and you talk to him.

513
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,393
And you can take your goddamn
condescending AMA voice...

514
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,199
and shove it up your pinched little ass!

515
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,916
To your continued success.

516
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,157
I'm very proud of you.

517
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,718
Maybe we should just skip
the rest of dinner...

518
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,396
and go right to the reward.

519
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,437
I haven't finished yet.

520
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,554
And you haven't touched your vegetables.

521
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,593
Well, this is bullshit.

522
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,513
<i>All that crap
about keeping your commitments.</i>

523
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,193
Well, I kept mine.

524
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,079
You have absolutely no intention
of keeping yours.

525
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,233
God damn it!

526
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,069
You really need to learn to trust more.

527
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,590
I need to dash. Early client.

528
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,510
Don't be late for school.

529
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,632
Hey, how's it going?

530
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,232
Can you pass the milk?

531
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,559
Who are you?

532
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,871
Adrian. Ava's son.

533
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,474
English - SDH
