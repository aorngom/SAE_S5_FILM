<i>Previously on Nip / Tuck:</i>

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,917
Tell me what you don't like about yourself.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,990
- My nose.
- My ass.

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,070
Everything.

5
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,958
Let me see them.

6
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,714
Don't you give up on me.

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,550
No one can fault us for finally admitting...

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,676
that we just can't do it anymore.

9
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,075
Hey!

10
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,196
Sean. What a surprise.

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,671
I'm here for my paternity results.

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,550
Just because you know
doesn't mean that anybody else has to.

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,231
<i>"Plastic surgeon sued
by dead dog's owner. "</i>

14
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,914
No wonder our appointment book
is filling up again.

15
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,998
<i>This is what Sexaholics Anonymous
calls blackout sex.</i>

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,394
Come home.

17
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,679
Tell me what you don't like about yourself.

18
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,714
You know what? Absolutely nothing.

19
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,797
Business is booming,
I love my wife and she loves me.

20
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,159
The kids are healthy. It's exactly how
I always pictured today feeling.

21
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,394
Is that why you were checking
for jowl droopage in Mr. Toasty?

22
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,074
Face it. There is nothing that's gonna
stop your body...

23
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,351
from screaming, "I'm 40"
from the highest rooftop.

24
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,114
Wait. Actually, there is something.

25
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,272
Happy birthday. Open it.

26
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,110
- BOTOX.
- I don't need this.

27
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,914
Yeah, you do. I've been shooting
my forehead full of it for months.

28
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,719
Face it, Sean,
we're not college kids anymore.

29
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,836
Your hairline's up and your ass is down.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,310
I'll be sure to put that on your
40th birthday card in a couple of weeks.

31
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,119
We're plastic surgeons.
The literal faces of this business.

32
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,192
Looking our age is as bad
as a stained carpet in the waiting room.

33
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,672
- Have you seen a fat personal trainer?
- But we don't look our age, Christian.

34
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,958
With advances in nutrition and exercise,
40 is the new 30.

35
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,118
You sell youth for a living, Dr. McNamara.

36
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,870
So stop being such a hypocrite,
and tilt your head back.

37
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,437
- Frown.
- Come on.

38
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,269
Being as smooth as a baby's butt is going
to delay your inevitable midlife crisis.

39
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,510
That was last year, remember?
Thanks, Christian. Really.

40
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,477
But I plan on spending my 40s
aging gracefully...

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,150
and exploring what's inside.

42
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,113
Let's go.

43
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,558
Julia's gonna kill you if you bring me late
to my own surprise birthday party.

44
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,597
- You know about that?
- When you're married almost 20 years...

45
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,591
nothing is a surprise anymore.

46
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,991
Can you at least try to look surprised,
for her?

47
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,473
Yet another reason not to do the BOTOX.

48
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,792
Surprise!

49
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,753
Great party.

50
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,873
How'd you pull this thing off
without me finding out?

51
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,191
- Come on. You knew.
- I was totally in the dark.

52
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,753
Got any other birthday surprises for me?

53
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,512
My mother's coming.

54
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,434
Surprise.

55
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,070
I tried to stop her, but she insisted.

56
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,358
Apparently, I distance her from the family
because I see her as a threat.

57
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,953
I'm threatened by her.

58
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,759
<i>And I've only seen her
hawking her books on Charlie Rose.</i>

59
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,036
You'll just have to come to terms
with the fact...

60
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,156
that your mother is a force of nature.

61
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,279
Remember at your wedding?
She looked hot for a broad in her 40s.

62
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,512
And as they say,
the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

63
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,238
Nice save.

64
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,557
I have no idea why she's coming,
or how long she's staying...

65
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,312
because she's a raging narcissist...

66
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,199
and so just assumes we'll all adjust
to her schedule.

67
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,796
Honey, it's okay.
You're the one she drives crazy, not me.

68
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,718
So I'll run interference.

69
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,077
Of course, it's not the surprise
I was hoping for.

70
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,312
We have an emergency.

71
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,389
What now?

72
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,156
- I need you to nurse.
- I'm sorry.

73
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,914
My tits are ripe, this blouse is silk.
Stains are forever.

74
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,436
- I need you to suck it up.
- That's disgusting.

75
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,798
Quit being such a drama queen.
It tastes just like sugar water. See?

76
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,959
- You're sick.
- No, Christian.

77
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,953
I am a frazzled working mother
who forgot her breast pump.

78
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,111
Look, I've been very clear with you.

79
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,840
There will be no suckage
of any kind anymore.

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,514
Our relationship from now on
is strictly parental.

81
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,559
Neither you nor fatherhood
is holding me hostage.

82
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,754
In other words, milk them yourself, Heidi.

83
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,956
I am not a cow, Christian.

84
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,238
They're too tender to manhandle.

85
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,519
Jesus, your nipples are the size
of pie plates.

86
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,719
If my milk ducts get swollen,
I'll pass any infection off to Wilber.

87
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,713
- I'm not swallowing.
- Why not? I do.

88
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,670
- Want some milk with your cake?
- No, thanks.

89
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,278
- Nervous, buddy?
- No, it's more like old age.

90
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,716
<i>Tell me what you didn't like
about yourself.</i>

91
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,158
It was an accident.

92
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,316
How many surgeries have you had,
Ms. Zucker?

93
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,552
Two. There was an infection.
That's how she developed the scarring.

94
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,670
- I'm sorry, Mr...
- Chad. Chad Myers.

95
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,270
And you and Ms...
Mrs. Zucker are married?

96
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,755
- No, I'm gay.
- And I'm a big fag hag.

97
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,391
No, we're best friends since we were 17.

98
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,997
- When did the accident happen?
- Nine months ago.

99
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,312
On my 34th birthday.
The party was kickass.

100
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,919
I was...

101
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,993
blown away. Literally.

102
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,590
Ms. Zucker...

103
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,230
To my knowledge, a loaded. 45
is not a traditional party favor.

104
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,513
She kept one in her purse for security.

105
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,715
Why did you pull the gun out?

106
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,157
Like she said, we were celebrating
her birthday in Fort Lauderdale.

107
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,633
We rented a Hummer limo,
went out clubbing and got really wasted.

108
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,869
Yeah, we kept drinking
and tried to think of...

109
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,350
just two people who'd made it past 30.

110
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,595
You know,
who'd gotten their dream later in life.

111
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,230
<i>And all we could come up with was...</i>

112
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,675
Nelson Mandela and Danny Aiello.

113
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,674
I was like, "It's all downhill from here,
we might as well just kill ourselves. "

114
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,311
And I pulled out my gun, as a joke.
I laughed, told her to put it away.

115
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,270
I went over to the minibar,
and that's when it accidentally went off.

116
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,479
Ta-da.

117
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,913
Ms. Zucker, I'm gonna be blunt with you.
There's no quick fix.

118
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,719
You're looking at
five reconstructive surgeries, maybe more.

119
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,793
And what's my alternative?
Burkas are so 2003.

120
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,349
- There's no guarantee...
- I know that, okay? I know.

121
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,669
I just want little kids
to stop looking at me and crying.

122
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,313
Sorry to interrupt.
Julia needs you to call her at home.

123
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,710
Some kind of emergency with her mother.

124
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,358
I want a face-lift.

125
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,552
What happened to, "Women should wear
their wrinkles like a badge of honor"?

126
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,632
That worked, when I was naive...

127
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,795
and firm enough to shove my braless tits...

128
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,520
in the faces
of all those patriarchal Freudians.

129
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,552
Beauty is power, Julia.

130
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,955
Both tend to diminish after 40.

131
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,079
Thank God by that time
I'd already been chairing...

132
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,879
the Psych department for five years.

133
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,192
I remember. You were never home.

134
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,997
It's just a good thing
I didn't sacrifice my career...

135
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,355
so my daughter could have one.

136
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,989
Come on, you can't be serious, Erica.
You look great.

137
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,472
- This is about Daddy, isn't it?
- This has nothing to do with your daddy.

138
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,438
I have a new book coming out.

139
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,990
I can't use the same picture
from my last two jacket covers.

140
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,559
Be honest, Mother.

141
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,951
He had a midlife crisis,
ran off with a younger woman...

142
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,272
- and now you wanna mutilate yourself.
- Age is what mutilates, Julia.

143
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,396
You'll find that out soon enough.

144
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,910
If you feel that strongly,
I'll be happy to refer you to Mark Rosen.

145
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,756
- No, Sean, you. I want you to do it.
- You want me to give you a face-lift?

146
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,515
You don't get your son-in-law
to perform surgery on you, Mother.

147
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,434
I want the best. I'm not above
using my connections to get him.

148
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,038
I don't get it, Erica.

149
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,351
It's not like your literary worth
has ever been predicated on looks.

150
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,478
You're one of the most respected
child psychologists in the country.

151
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,393
Respected doesn't sell books.
Not anymore.

152
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,391
Sex does.

153
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,873
You see this photo?

154
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,079
I was 41 here.

155
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,991
The photographer who took it
had a raging erection the entire session.

156
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,388
Jesus.

157
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,438
The point is, I was desired.

158
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,551
Can you do that, Sean?

159
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,274
Make me look like I'm in my prime?

160
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,916
Make me desirable again?

161
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,434
Been thinking about that game
Libby Zucker was playing...

162
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,669
before she shot herself.

163
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,196
Can you think of anyone whose life
improved dramatically after 40?

164
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,720
- Us.
- Be serious, Christian.

165
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,111
We're on a plateau. A high plateau,
I'll give you that. But still...

166
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,158
I am serious, Sean.
The climb has just begun.

167
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,834
With Bobolit out of the picture,
we're primed to become...

168
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,560
the premier plastic surgery destination
in the southern US.

169
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,994
The world is our oyster...

170
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,879
and we're gonna suck that bitch down
with a champagne chaser.

171
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,996
And you're gonna do all that
with a baby in tow?

172
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,311
- Your priorities are about to change.
- No, they're not.

173
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,631
Welcome to the world of
pediatrician appointments, school plays...

174
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,633
and if you ever decide to get married
and inherit some in-laws...

175
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,155
you have to start parenting them, too.

176
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,232
You can look like a 30-year-old
as long as you want.

177
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,715
- You just can't live like one.
- Bullshit, Sean.

178
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,394
I plan on banging twice as many
mamazons this decade...

179
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,233
in far more depraved and debauched ways.

180
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,552
You think Gina will be okay with that?

181
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,315
I didn't hand Gina my balls
when I agreed to raise Wilber.

182
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,199
I'll hire a nanny to pick up the slack.

183
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,470
Ever think she wishes she died?
Actually, I think she wishes...

184
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,918
that she'd looked normal enough
that no one ever asked her that question.

185
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,119
15-blade.

186
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,756
Is there something wrong?

187
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,792
The trajectory of devastation is odd.
Suction.

188
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,031
She was waving a gun
around drunk.

189
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,510
She's lucky her brains didn't
end up on the reversible painting...

190
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,272
like her jawline.

191
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,032
<i>The what?
The yips.</i>

192
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,829
<i>The yips? Nothing on the scan?</i>

193
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,268
No neurological disorders.
No Parkinson's. No Huntington's.

194
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,759
Other than being the sound
an unruly puppy makes...

195
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,797
what exactly is a yip?

196
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,351
Picture a beautiful afternoon
on the golf course.

197
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,157
Your iron shot lands on
the seventh hole, a foot from the cup...

198
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,629
and you are one sweet tap
from carding a birdie.

199
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,951
And then just as your putter
makes contact with the ball...

200
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,112
a little tic interrupts your perfect stroke...

201
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,194
and your ball rolls right past the cup.

202
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,319
<i>From that moment on,
you cannot get that ball in the cup...</i>

203
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,833
for love or money.

204
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,269
That's the yips.

205
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,079
This isn't a game for me. This is serious.

206
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,593
I'm being very serious.

207
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,115
My brother-in-law had a big future
in the golf circuit.

208
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,032
His yips cost him his career.

209
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,715
I've diagnosed about a dozen people
with the yips in the last year...

210
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,519
and every one of them,
dentists, a concert pianist...

211
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,796
every one of them has been
at the top of his game.

212
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,236
That, unfortunately,
is the significant aspect of the profile.

213
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,109
So what are you saying?
That this is some kind of self-sabotage?

214
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,193
I don't know. It's not a medical condition.
It's purely psychological.

215
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,352
Are you experiencing anxiety
over expectations?

216
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,270
<i>Well, I don't know. I'm not a shrink.</i>

217
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,159
<i>But what would seem obvious,
even to me...</i>

218
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,029
is that when something keeps showing up,
it's begging for attention.

219
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,910
Now, I can't tell you what that thing is,
because it's coming from inside you.

220
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,073
I came here to dispel my worries,
or at least have some light shed on them.

221
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,390
Believe me, Sean,
I wish had found something...

222
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,599
I could operate on or resolve
with medication. It just isn't there.

223
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,192
- What happened to your brother-in-law?
- He went the Jack Daniel's route.

224
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,873
I do feel I should advise you, Sean,
as a physician and a friend.

225
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,199
It would be highly unethical to operate
until you've got a handle on this.

226
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,399
A slip of the hand, you would really
have something to worry about.

227
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,110
Ms. Appleton,
according to your resume...

228
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,840
you've been employed as a nanny
for the last three years.

229
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,673
Right. I worked for a family
that lived on Palm Island...

230
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,159
until they moved to New York.

231
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,392
And before that,
you were a cheerleader at USF?

232
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,475
Yeah.

233
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,195
What about infant CPR?
Is your certification up-to-date?

234
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,716
- Of course.
- Impressive.

235
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,955
I never thought I'd find someone
who fulfilled my nanny requirements...

236
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,190
as well as you do, Ms. Appleton.

237
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,397
- You can call me Kelly.
- I think we should keep it formal for now.

238
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,791
Whatever you like, Daddy.

239
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,912
Don't call me that.

240
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,318
How about, "Whatever you like, Dr. Troy"?

241
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,473
Sounds good.

242
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,031
Your mother-in-law is on line 1.
She's adamant about scheduling her lift.

243
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,869
- What's going on?
- Nothing. Just doing a little inventory.

244
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,237
Absolut. Straight up.

245
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,515
Can you believe the shit
that passes for music these days?

246
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,959
Maybe you should hang out here
on Thursdays. It's oldies night.

247
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,154
Thank God.

248
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,999
Thank you.

249
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,512
What are you doing?

250
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,712
Exhibiting a feat
of modern technological daring...

251
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,190
by programming my phone number
into your cell.

252
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,992
Thus proving that I'm a modern man
of my times.

253
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,032
Christian Troy.

254
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,278
Plastic surgeon.

255
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,798
Nicole Watts. Orthopedics resident.

256
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,638
Can I buy you a drink?

257
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,834
Smile.

258
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,836
Sorry, but no thanks.

259
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,275
Is there spinach, sweetheart?

260
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,193
No. Your veneers are great.

261
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,758
And there's not a wrinkle
on that noble brow.

262
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,112
A lack of worry, or BOTOX?

263
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,588
Hmm.

264
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,079
I wonder.

265
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,232
So you're a bitter lipstick lesbian.
I'm sorry that I took up your time.

266
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,709
Actually, Christian, I love dick.

267
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,398
I just don't dig 40-year-old dick.

268
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,878
That's perfect, because mine's 35.

269
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,790
Why don't we go somewhere
dark and private...

270
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,793
and you can count the rings
around my trunk?

271
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,000
Look. You seem cool.

272
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,558
But I have a real daddy,
and I don't need another one.

273
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,119
Wanna dance?

274
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,354
Sure.

275
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,672
You had no right to fire my nanny.

276
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,035
I don't want my child around
cheap, common whores.

277
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,909
He's around you all the time.
Correction. You're an expensive whore.

278
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,311
That'll cost you a pair of Gucci
baby booties for your son, asshole.

279
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,268
Oh, correction. The adorable baby
I let you pretend is your son.

280
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,874
What does that mean?
What that means...

281
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,349
is that I make the rules,
because I am the legal parent.

282
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,830
- Rule number one: Don't screw the nanny.
- I didn't.

283
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,872
Then what's this?

284
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,470
It just kills you that I screw other women,
doesn't it, Gina?

285
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,432
She was fantastic, by the way.
A real spinner.

286
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,558
Say goodbye to your daddy, Wilber.

287
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,280
- You won't see him for a while.
- I'll see him on Friday...

288
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,477
when you go to your Sexaholics meeting.
Our standing father-son date.

289
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,552
It's cancelled, sociopath,
until you can learn to acknowledge...

290
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,234
- Stop telling me what to do!
- Listen to me, slick dick!

291
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,358
I left Wilber with you,
not with some stranger.

292
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,755
You can't have it all.
You cannot be a kid and have a kid.

293
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,309
Now look what you've done, asshole.

294
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,678
Friday at 7:00.

295
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,596
And I'm rehiring my nanny!

296
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,875
What do you mean,
Christian's going to do it?

297
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,395
I don't want him. I want you.
Sorry, Erica.

298
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,597
If anything went wrong,
I wouldn't have the emotional objectivity...

299
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,958
- to trust my ability to make decisions.
- I had no idea you felt that strongly.

300
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,237
- Perhaps you should talk to someone.
- I'm not doing your face-lift...

301
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,630
because I have a responsibility to you,
to Julia.

302
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,189
Your safety is not something
I'm willing to risk.

303
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,318
Why? Do you have a subconscious desire
to harm me?

304
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,916
I assure you, any desire I have to harm you
is totally conscious.

305
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,319
Look, Christian is one of the best.
Trust me.

306
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,911
He's got great hands.

307
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,235
So, Erica, tell me what you don't like
about yourself.

308
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,994
My neck...

309
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,914
my eyes...

310
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,318
my stupidity.

311
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,110
Why did I ever let you go?

312
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,553
I bet you say that to all the boys
you slept with at your daughter's wedding.

313
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,395
- Ancient history.
- Ancient. Yes.

314
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,709
Why not throw in "dead and buried. "

315
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,279
You know I didn't mean anything by that.

316
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,989
- You look wonderful.
- No, you look wonderful, you bastard.

317
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,396
A handsome young prince turned into...

318
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,755
an even more handsome
young plastic surgeon.

319
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,753
I turned into an old lady
who needs a face-lift.

320
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,115
You must think I'm pathetic.

321
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,273
Actually, I still think you're a knockout.

322
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,229
You don't need a face-lift, Erica.

323
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,750
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.

324
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,480
When a hunky guy at the airport
asks you directions...

325
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,710
not because he's trying to pick you up...

326
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,553
but because he really wants
those directions...

327
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,952
you've fallen off the radar,
sexually speaking.

328
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,031
It happens to everybody.

329
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,193
I got shot down last night by a 25-year-old.

330
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,193
Don't patronize me.
It's a true story.

331
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,432
Somehow I've become that old guy
on my driver's license.

332
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,239
The one I've been hiding myself from...

333
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,834
until it's time to renew...

334
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,830
and then there is some even older guy
next to my name...

335
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,152
pretending to be me.

336
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,472
How can you say that? You're still a kid.

337
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,710
An incredibly beautiful kid.

338
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,959
Feel that?

339
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,989
Yes.

340
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,910
It's the fountain of youth.

341
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,074
All I need is for you to turn it on.

342
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,792
You're healing nicely.

343
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,149
It looks so great, Lib.

344
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,518
Can I see?

345
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,514
Well, I look hot.

346
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,438
Actually, I thought there was going to be
more progress.

347
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,669
Lib, come on.

348
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,277
Dr. McNamara fully explained
this first procedure was architectural.

349
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,351
<i>It's just the beginning.</i>

350
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,233
I know Dr. McNamara
needs some private exam time...

351
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,710
so I'll see you tomorrow morning
before I go to work, okay?

352
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,711
<i>I thought we were
watching Glitter tonight.</i>

353
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,031
- I thought I told you, I have a dinner.
- With who?

354
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,156
- A friend.
- I'm your friend.

355
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,079
- And I need you here tonight, Chad.
- I need a break, okay?

356
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,754
One night away from the tubes and...

357
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,350
Look, I'll see you tomorrow.

358
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,878
Thanks, Doctor.

359
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,870
- You okay?
- He's dating someone again. I know it.

360
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,117
And this is a bad thing?

361
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,433
No. Not at all.

362
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,793
They never last. But we do.

363
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,559
Ms. Zucker...

364
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,553
I recommend that we move you
to Fairmont Convalescent Center...

365
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,836
- at the end of the week.
- A nursing home?

366
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,911
A physical and emotional recovery center.

367
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,390
If you think I need to be
on a suicide watch, forget it.

368
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,317
It takes self-esteem and courage
to pull a trigger.

369
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,956
If I couldn't do it the first time,
what makes you think I could do it now?

370
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,190
I wasn't supposed to be here...

371
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,989
with pus draining down my throat,
looking like a monster.

372
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,393
Neither was Chad.

373
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,795
The plan was for us to meet upstairs
at the eternal tea dance in the clouds.

374
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,392
That was the plan.

375
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,116
We went out for my birthday,
but it wasn't fun anymore.

376
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,758
Our jobs sucked.

377
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,151
Nobody offered to buy us drinks.

378
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,676
So we thought...

379
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,680
why not go out in a blaze of glory.

380
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,512
1, 2...

381
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,878
<i>But I couldn't do it.
I loved him too much.</i>

382
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,593
...3.

383
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,273
When such a big thing
was taken from you...

384
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,194
- did you ever wish...
- I hadn't lived?

385
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,074
No.

386
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,509
It took almost dying
to realize that aging isn't a curse.

387
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,112
It's a privilege.

388
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:34,591
You have to set aside an hour four times
a week if you want to see results.

389
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,910
I'm happy to just maintain.

390
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,039
Apparently.

391
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,994
We managed to get through
the entire hour...

392
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,680
without bludgeoning each other
with the free weights.

393
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,594
Let's not wreck it now.
You're right. It's fun.

394
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,035
But, darling, stop kidding yourself.

395
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,789
Once you hit 40, it's war.
You against gravity.

396
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,639
Forty? Wow!

397
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,992
Your troops must have
incredible battle fatigue.

398
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,359
When I consulted with Christian
about my lift...

399
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,795
he told me I had the body of a 40-year-old.

400
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,317
He seemed to think my body
was as good as yours.

401
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,075
Please, Mother.
He was just trying to make you feel better.

402
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,589
He'd already taken care of that.

403
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,952
You slept with him?

404
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,672
We're both single, consenting adults.
Should I have asked permission?

405
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,312
Excuse me,
have I broken some unholy law?

406
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,954
"Thou shalt not sleep with thy
son-in-law's partner"?

407
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,190
Yes, when he's about to operate
on your face.

408
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,351
Why are you so upset?

409
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:58,194
Because having a face-lift...

410
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,510
is so totally indulgent.

411
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,790
You're appealing enough to seduce
a man 20 years younger than you.

412
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,712
What more do you want?

413
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,918
Look at me, Julia.

414
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,636
My God, what are you doing?

415
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,315
You can exercise years off your body,
and I have. See?

416
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,230
But crunches can't tighten the skin
under your chin.

417
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,913
I want to feel the way he made me feel
for more than just an hour.

418
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,233
I want someone to look at the entire me
with desire.

419
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,311
But he didn't look at me.
He didn't open his eyes.

420
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,948
Not once.

421
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,309
To get through it,
he had to fantasize about someone else.

422
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,995
That kid never sleeps
for longer than 15 minutes.

423
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,713
He does for me.

424
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,519
Seriously? You can get him to sleep?

425
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,554
I know how to wear all my boys out.

426
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,072
- Wanna see my trick?
- Sure.

427
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,595
What's she doing, boy? Come here.

428
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,117
You're okay. It's okay.

429
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,158
What's the matter, buddy? Here.

430
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,556
Come on. Put this in.

431
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,476
- Cough syrup? What's that for?
- I call this a binkatini.

432
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,358
It'll put him out for hours.

433
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,159
- Open up, baby boy.
- Are you kidding me?

434
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,232
- You've been poisoning my kid with this?
- Chill out.

435
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,755
It's just over-the-counter stuff.

436
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,429
Get out.

437
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,596
- What the hell?
- I said get out, you incompetent bitch.

438
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,714
Don't you start that "baby comes first"
shit with me, Dr. Troy.

439
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,394
If you wanted a real nanny,
you would've hired one...

440
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,035
that didn't deep throat Daddy
during the job interview.

441
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,189
It's okay.

442
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,999
It's not funny, Sean.

443
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,833
I'm sorry, but the picture
of those two vain little peas...

444
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,912
in their self-absorbed pods
pumping away over the desk...

445
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,436
- It's hilarious if you think about it.
- I don't want to think about it.

446
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,558
Come on. Why are you taking this
so personally?

447
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,553
My own mother flashed me at the gym...

448
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,996
and then she insisted
she had a better body than me.

449
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,559
She doesn't.

450
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,154
If she bothers you so much...

451
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,675
let's have Christian do her lift
and send her packing.

452
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,991
She says there's a conflict of interest now,
because she screwed him.

453
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,720
She's insisting again that you do it.

454
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,714
Would you?

455
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,034
Then we never have to buy her
another Christmas present...

456
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,792
for as long as we live.

457
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,355
Sure.

458
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,909
You're nothing like her, you know.

459
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,718
Our kids are so lucky.

460
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:13,193
Turning 40 agrees with you.
You've become positively unflappable.

461
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,069
Hello?

462
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,032
Come here.

463
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,828
He's been like this for hours.

464
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,752
I did my faces, my "Tickle Me Elmo" voice.

465
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,399
Nothing calmed him down.

466
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,471
He doesn't feel feverish.

467
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,518
Why are you doing that?
I already burped him.

468
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,150
Apparently not to completion.

469
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,676
You and me playing mom and pop.
It's quite a picture, huh?

470
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,679
Why didn't you call Gina?

471
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,513
And let her know
that I'm an incompetent dad? No way.

472
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,717
<i>- She'd use that against me.
- Well, then read Doctor Spock.</i>

473
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,792
Sean and I can't keep cleaning up
your messes.

474
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,589
- Why are you being such a bitch?
- You slept with my mother.

475
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,995
Once.

476
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,190
- At your wedding.
- Also at my wedding?

477
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,949
So, I see she offered up full disclosure.

478
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:49,590
- Okay, Christian, thank you.
- For what?

479
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,072
For releasing me completely
from any residual emotional attachment...

480
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,719
that I might have had towards you.

481
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,189
I thought we decided
we weren't going there again.

482
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,874
But you can't keep up your end
of the bargain, can you?

483
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,998
My mother and I bear more than
a passing resemblance to each other.

484
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,390
When you were screwing her,
with your eyes closed...

485
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,834
and everything was soft focus...

486
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,389
who did you pretend you were with?

487
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,996
Stop hurting me
because you can't have me, Christian.

488
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:21,474
You turn 40 next week.
For everybody's sake, grow up.

489
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,751
This must be weird for you.

490
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,237
It is. She looks
a little too much like Julia.

491
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,231
Though I guess
that didn't bother you.

492
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,392
I needed to feel more May
than September for a change.

493
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,596
More like August, October.

494
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,670
You ready to turn back time?

495
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,589
Scalpel.

496
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,158
Thank you, Nurse.

497
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,759
You all right?

498
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:36,315
Liz is right. This must be weird
for you. Like cutting into your wife's face.

499
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,519
I get it. I'll do it. You supervise.

500
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,794
Be kind.

501
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,229
I think I work better on women
I've screwed.

502
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,995
Once you've seen a woman's come face,
you've seen her soul.

503
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,153
That was eerie what we just did in there,
wasn't it?

504
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,834
Men age and society says
we've become more rugged...

505
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,349
women age and they just become...

506
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,430
old.

507
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:28,950
Sad.

508
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,796
It is sad, isn't it?
To be 40 and know you've peaked.

509
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,759
Jesus, Sean.

510
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,754
We've been through this.
Accentuate the positive for a change.

511
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,113
I have a yip.

512
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,749
A what?

513
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,354
A spasm. A psychological disorder.

514
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:49,519
- It's why I couldn't do Erica's lift today.
- When did this first happen?

515
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,716
I could barely get through
the Zucker surgery.

516
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,997
You operated on a patient knowing
this could affect your performance?

517
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,309
What was I supposed to do?

518
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,789
You can do a garden-variety lift,
congratulations...

519
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,871
but you don't have
the skill or experience...

520
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,315
to do complicated microsurgery.

521
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,429
What kind of surgical destination for
the southern US are we supposed to be...

522
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,397
when one of us is an invalid?

523
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,714
If I can't operate, we can't operate.

524
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:28,230
From Vicodin to morphine. I'm stoked.

525
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,029
How does it work?

526
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,590
When you feel discomfort,
you push this little button...

527
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,514
and the medication instantly disperses
into your bloodstream.

528
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,551
Can you overdose on it?

529
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:43,349
No. The system has safeguards.

530
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,559
Ms. Zucker, I'm working late tonight.
And when I'm off...

531
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:51,030
I can help transport you to
the medical facility if your friend doesn't...

532
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,474
Hey, beautiful.

533
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,429
I'll be here for an hour,
if you need me, okay?

534
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,794
Thanks.

535
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,269
<i>So, we all packed and ready to go?</i>

536
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,555
Almost.

537
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,115
Okay.

538
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,635
- Where were you?
- I was stuck in traffic.

539
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,394
- It was terrible.
- Have some dignity. Stop lying.

540
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,799
- Okay. I was with a friend.
- You mean a boyfriend.

541
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,713
- You were afraid to tell me.
- Because you make me take sides...

542
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,713
- and I'm sick of it.
- Actually, it's me you're sick of, right?

543
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,997
And my disgusting, medicinal,
hospital smells and my needs.

544
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,549
- When you're like this, yes.
- It's not going to last.

545
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,073
I'm in love with him.

546
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,679
<i>His name is Jesse, and he loves me, too.</i>

547
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,991
- Let me guess. Massage therapist?
- An architect.

548
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:47,152
He doesn't do drugs, he's not in A. A.,
he's a together person, Lib.

549
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,549
He wants me to move in with him.

550
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,114
I wanna talk about it with you first.

551
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,395
I guess there goes the baby idea.

552
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:03,270
I love you,
but not the way you want, okay?

553
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:06,677
I have never loved you that way,
and I never will.

554
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,078
There. After 20 years, I've finally said it.

555
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:14,993
You're mean.

556
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,152
You're still my best friend. I will help you.

557
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,630
I just can't keep doing this, Lib.

558
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,594
What happened to us,
it taught me so much, Libby.

559
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,671
I realized there's so much to live for.

560
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,513
There's so much of life
I've been squandering and now...

561
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,318
I have a chance to be whole.

562
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,436
It's a real chance, and I'm going to take it.

563
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:36,354
What happens when your hair turns gray?
And you get fat and ugly?

564
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,917
I'm the only one who's going to love you.
He won't.

565
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,880
He said he wants to grow old with me.

566
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,389
Someone finally said that to me.

567
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,194
Well, I can't let that happen, Chad.

568
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,638
I love you too much to let you grow old.

569
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,353
"As long as I'm living
My baby you'll be"

570
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,674
Wanna help Daddy celebrate his birthday?

571
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,517
Let's make a wish.

572
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,233
<i>Please, let me be
a good father.</i>

573
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,349
