1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,109
<i>Previously on Nip / Tuck:</i>

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,714
Get out!

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,793
- When's Mom coming back?
- She's not.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,554
What are you living on
since you and Merrill split the sheets?

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,790
I've been transitioning into acting.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,198
<i>It's so rewarding to do more
than stand there and pose.</i>

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,711
Now I get to stand there and speak.

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,954
I will never forgive you for what happened.

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,959
I know.

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,158
Tell us what you don't like about
yourself, Mr. Connors.

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,155
Before we begin, I'd just like to say my
partner and I are big fans of your column.

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,318
We read it over breakfast in my house.

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,870
I love the one that you wrote
about wiping your ass with leaves.

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,149
The column about how you lived for
a month as an 18th-century settler...

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,312
to prove the inconvenience
of modern conveniences.

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,199
Right. And interesting you remember
my ass habits.

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,071
I just remember how fetching
my wife looked in her bloomers.

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,671
Living in a fishbowl
is all in a day's work as this one's wife.

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,389
- So how can we be of help today?
- Well, I'd like some boobs.

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,670
- You mean pec implants.
- No. Real lady boobs.

21
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,035
Amy recently lost a breast to cancer.

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,275
We were both a little surprised
at how much her sense of herself...

23
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,519
her sexual identity,
was tied up in her breasts.

24
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,437
<i>I just want to do something radical
in solidarity with her.</i>

25
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,160
Try and help understand
what she's been through.

26
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,198
And to understand women
and their breasts in general.

27
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,277
And he's got a book contract.

28
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,838
<i>Walk a Mile In My Boobs.</i>

29
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,350
And all the proceeds go
to Amy's cancer recovery center.

30
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,191
So, Mr. Connors,
were you thinking of these as permanent?

31
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,710
No, a year sounds about right.

32
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,316
- And what size?
- Like hers.

33
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,869
It's high Cs.

34
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,389
I figured after my mastectomy,
I'd go up a size.

35
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,155
Mr. Connors, putting the swelling,
pain, and risk of infection aside...

36
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,471
you'll have some sagging tissue
after the removal of the implants...

37
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,835
which would require
another surgery to eliminate.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,514
There will be some colloidal
and hypertrophic scarring.

39
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,358
Sorry, you're just whetting my appetite.

40
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,670
No story is easy.
That's not what I'm looking for.

41
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,717
Besides, anything I go through will pale...

42
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,553
in comparison to what Amy's
already been through.

43
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,515
That's my book.

44
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,151
What do you say? Will you do it?

45
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,669
Go deep.

46
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,074
Cop a feel of the brand-new implants,
partner.

47
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,671
FedEx dropped off six months' worth
of tits an hour ago.

48
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,150
I like the new packaging.
Let me go to second base with the B.

49
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,954
Heads up.

50
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,588
I assume this is some
kind of male bonding ritual...

51
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,910
whereby your partnership
is being reaffirmed.

52
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,389
Fess up, Lizzie. You're a tit man.

53
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,549
I'm not.

54
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,715
But I'm thrilled that we're working on one.

55
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,916
Is that what I. Connors is getting?

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,594
- We're passing on that job.
- Too many risks.

57
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,509
It's for his wife's cancer center.

58
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,230
- Don't you get how great that is?
- Great for cancer. Disastrous for us.

59
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,358
We won't be taken seriously.
It's an unseemly publicity stunt.

60
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,351
Let me ask you guys something.

61
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,477
70%/% of your business is shoving
breast implants into women.

62
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,513
It's as easy for you as slicing a bagel.

63
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,551
It's unnatural to put them in a man.

64
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,269
It's no more unnatural than putting
in a boob three times a woman's size...

65
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,670
- and disfiguring her.
- We don't disfigure women.

66
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,229
Right. You enhance them.

67
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,197
<i>Why can't the same be said for I. Connors?</i>

68
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,874
Plus, here is a man
who is getting fake titties...

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,993
not to raise his low self-esteem, but
to heighten awareness about a disease.

70
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,790
If I. Connors isn't the perfect candidate
for cosmetic surgery...

71
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,552
then I don't know who is.

72
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,630
Attagirl. All done.

73
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,476
- I thought it would hurt more.
- You were so brave, honey.

74
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,913
<i>Hello?
Hey.</i>

75
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,588
Hi, Mommy.

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,231
Daddy just took my blood to make sure
I don't have juvenile diabetes.

77
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,632
Diabetes? Let me speak to Daddy, honey.

78
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,395
What?

79
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,915
Sean, why are you taking
blood from Annie?

80
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,399
Go get your shoes on, sweetheart.
We're leaving in five minutes.

81
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,913
- Why do you think?
- Sean, it's an insane thing to do.

82
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,035
<i>Annie is your daughter...</i>

83
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,589
Can I help you
with you something specific?

84
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,950
Yeah.

85
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,478
I've taken a place here
at Marine Gardens...

86
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,076
and the kitchen isn't fully equipped.

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,549
<i>I'd like to come by and get
the espresso machine. You never use it.</i>

88
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,953
Will you be around?

89
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,636
The house will be empty all day.
Come by anytime before 5:00.

90
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,195
<i>Anything else?</i>

91
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,710
Let's get it all worked out now
so you don't call all day long.

92
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,752
I'd like to pick up Annie
after school and show her my place.

93
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,831
No, I don't want to disrupt her routine.

94
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,992
Sean, why is it that you can forgive
Christian, but not me?

95
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,515
I don't know if I've forgiven him, Julia.

96
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,439
And how dare you ask me that?

97
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,149
As if I owe you any kind of explanation
at all for anything I feel.

98
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,990
<i>You can have Annie through the weekend,
but it's the last time until...</i>

99
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,357
<i>we work out something more formal
with the lawyers.</i>

100
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,596
Congratulations.
So, you're officially a whore now.

101
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,036
- Wrong. I'm a businesswoman.
- And I'm secretary of state.

102
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,630
Ms. Henry, you've made an appointment...

103
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,314
so tell us
what you don't like about yourself.

104
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,915
Her vagina.

105
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,433
This is a prototype of the new
Kimber Henry doll.

106
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,991
- The Rolls-Royce of RDs.
- RDs?

107
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,038
RealDolls. You know, sex dolls.

108
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,631
She's made out of high-grade silicone
that feels totally like flesh.

109
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,237
All of her joints are completely
flexible. Each of her three points of entry...

110
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,512
form a vacuum upon penetration...

111
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,434
which creates a suction effect
for super intense orgasms.

112
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,714
Remind me...

113
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,475
did I ever say anything during the course
of our sad, sordid affair...

114
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,155
that might lead you to believe
I'd be interested in this freak show?

115
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,550
Don't pretend to be prude, Christian.

116
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,713
RealDolls are sold to doctors,
judges, housewives and movie stars...

117
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,277
most of whom are
a lot less depraved than you.

118
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,909
Are you back on coke?

119
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,197
Do you ask all your potential clients
such rude questions?

120
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,713
Excuse my language, Dr. McNamara,
but your partner's a rude asshole...

121
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,316
who acts like he knows it all,
but in fact, he doesn't know shit.

122
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,479
You're not the first
to suggest that, Ms. Henry.

123
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,069
What is it you want from us that
your doll maker can't provide?

124
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,792
I'm not thrilled with what
they've done to her vagina.

125
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,636
It looks too generic to me.
I'd like it to be appealing and pretty.

126
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,633
The folds are too fleshy. See?

127
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,958
So I thought of you because
you're flesh sculptors.

128
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,433
I have orifice approval.

129
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,389
Back up a bit.

130
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,349
The last I heard, you were taking
Learning Annex acting classes.

131
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,150
So how did you get from Lady Macbeth
to Lady Machole?

132
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,880
I got real, Christian.
That's what happened.

133
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,312
I realized it wasn't my talent for playing
a character that people responded to.

134
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,356
It's my raw, simmering sensuality.

135
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,156
I simply got tired of fighting my nature.

136
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,675
Why don't you admit
you didn't have the patience...

137
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,196
to develop your skills as an actress,
so now you're doing porn?

138
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,838
You asked me what happened.
Do you want an answer?

139
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,439
Yes, I made a pornographic video.

140
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,357
It was an erotic fairy tale.
I had one sexual partner.

141
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,955
Everyone had their AIDS and STD tests.

142
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,670
They've already had 40,000 orders
for the next one.

143
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,514
That's unheard of.

144
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,634
My deal with Flawless Video is to make
five more digital films, at which point...

145
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,315
I move behind the camera.
Produce, maybe even direct.

146
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,958
The doll is key.

147
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,317
It'll make me an instant icon
in this fast-growing market.

148
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,478
Miss Kimber will go for $10,000.
I get $8,000 of that.

149
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,434
No offense.

150
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,956
I can see the doll is well fabricated,
but in the end, she's just rubber.

151
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,075
<i>She's not real.</i>

152
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,674
Sometimes, Doctor,
real isn't what you want.

153
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,509
The grownups
have to get back to work now, Kimber...

154
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,797
so why don't you pack up
both of your vaginas and go home?

155
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,595
Sean, I'll see you in surgery.

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,831
Before you turn me down, Christian...

157
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,878
Flawless Video is willing to pay $50,000...

158
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,754
for the perfect Miss Kimber pussy mold.

159
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,155
She's offering $50,000, Christian.
It's a lot of money to turn down.

160
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,355
Wake up, Sean.

161
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,557
There is only one reason
Kimber Henry came to us. She loves me.

162
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,269
The ugly vag was just an excuse
to get me in a room with her again.

163
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,153
She's a train wreck, Sean.
She can't help herself.

164
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,432
I've had enough Kimber Henry drama
for many lifetimes.

165
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,718
We are passing on this job.

166
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,235
I don't think you realize
how much revenue we lost...

167
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,152
during those weeks we were splitting up.

168
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,073
Now, we've got a payroll to meet.
Quarterly taxes next week.

169
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,800
Then it's very simple, Sean.
You take the case.

170
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,194
She doesn't want me, Christian.
She wants you. That was abundantly clear.

171
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,316
Then if she refuses you,
we'll know she's looking for trouble.

172
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,436
If she accepts, she's legit,
and we put $50,000 in the bank.

173
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,471
You know I'm right about this.

174
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,351
- Smile.
- What are you doing?

175
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,319
It's for my ever-expanding harassment file,
which will be on my lawyer's desk...

176
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,075
unless you get rid of that
demeaning, dehumanizing, degrading...

177
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,073
nightmare of a male fantasy
by the start of business tomorrow.

178
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,915
If you try to get to know her, Liz,
I think you might find she runs quite deep.

179
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,311
By 9:00, tomorrow morning, gentlemen.
Good day.

180
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,319
She's right, Sean.

181
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,750
<i>You'll have to take the doll
to chez McNamara.</i>

182
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,559
- I have a daughter.
- Then put her in the closet.

183
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,395
The doll.

184
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,159
You take her home.

185
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,920
So I can stare for hours
at the deranged bitch...

186
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,799
who tried to cut
my dick off with a knife? No way.

187
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,713
You want to take this case,
you carry the burden.

188
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,560
Actually, it could be a pleasant evening.

189
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,798
She doesn't eat much,
she doesn't mind watching boxing.

190
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,356
Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I like
women with a few flaws and a brain.

191
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,078
Where did that get you?

192
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,518
I'm going to apply the prosthetic
alginate cream now.

193
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,874
Good foresight.
You shaved the entire area.

194
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,838
I got that done a week ago.
It's a Brazilian wax.

195
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,311
Haven't you ever seen one before?

196
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,193
Normally, my female patients are
shaved by Nurse Linda, so, I...

197
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,914
My wife does something
called a bikini wax...

198
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,750
which is not the same, obviously.

199
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,230
No, I've never seen one.

200
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,989
All the girls get them done now, Doctor.

201
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,638
Let me know if the temperature
of the paste is uncomfortable.

202
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,915
It's perfect.

203
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,719
Can I ask you a question, Sean?

204
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,996
- Can I call you Sean?
- Yes, sure.

205
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,874
What is it called when a person likes pain?

206
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,669
A masochist.

207
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,676
Do you think I'm a masochist, Sean?

208
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,592
I'm not sure what you mean.

209
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,274
Well, like today, when...

210
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,910
you said that Christian couldn't...

211
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,958
excuse me, wouldn't be here...

212
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,117
I felt so much pain, like I couldn't breathe.

213
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,830
How can I love someone so much
that hurts me so bad?

214
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,758
Sometimes love and hate
seem intertwined, don't they?

215
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,119
Now we have what's called
the mother mold.

216
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,710
I'll make a positive plaster cast from this...

217
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,429
which will then be used to make
the final vaginal cast for Miss Kimber.

218
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,875
Well, this did not hurt a bit.

219
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,393
Speaking of hurt...

220
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,879
I don't think you're a masochist, Kimber.

221
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,113
I just think you're a trusting person.
Maybe too trusting.

222
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,839
I'm a bit like that.

223
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,234
We put all our trust in the people we love.

224
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,112
So you don't think I'm some
pathetic old whore, like Christian does?

225
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,032
No, I don't think that.

226
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,434
I admire your spirit. You're a fighter.

227
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,229
Really? You admire me?

228
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,795
I wish I had that much worked out.

229
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,159
I wish my wife did.

230
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,713
We just separated.

231
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,314
I'm sorry.

232
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,429
What?

233
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,753
Okay. Speaking of change.

234
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,311
I know this is kind of cheating,
but no one's going to know.

235
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,036
When you make the mold,
do you think you could...

236
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,396
make the labia just a touch more delicate?

237
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,273
I don't understand.

238
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,351
I'd like my vagina to be prettier.

239
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,073
- I just think it could be better.
- I think it's perfect.

240
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,957
Did you hurt this much, babe?

241
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,156
- I remember discomfort.
- Discomfort.

242
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,189
Shit. Well, this is pain.
This is the real deal.

243
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,354
<i>This is like an elephant
standing on my nads.</i>

244
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,310
Chapter one:
Men are pussies. Women are lions.

245
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,192
Christ, I'm Pam Anderson.

246
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,640
- Babe?
- That's beautiful work, Dr. Troy.

247
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,393
I'm glad you're pleased.

248
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,279
The swelling will go down
over the next few weeks.

249
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,232
Can I touch them?
Yeah, sure.

250
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,474
Be gentle.

251
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,476
You like them? I kind of like them.

252
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,594
- Honey, what's wrong?
- I don't know.

253
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,315
I'm sorry.
Can you excuse me for a minute?

254
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,717
Okay, you're a woman.
Any ideas on what just happened there?

255
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,952
Well, she's probably reliving
something about the cancer trauma.

256
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,634
- Right.
- Bingo. Yeah, I should've known that.

257
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,433
Chapter two: The breast as lightning rod.

258
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,830
<i>Strange to say this in
what has been a one-sided fight so far.</i>

259
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,719
<i>Is this the toughest test
of the Beantowner's career so far?</i>

260
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,917
<i>I'd say so. He's
fighting a guy who's got good speed...</i>

261
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,435
<i>good punching power,
and who's out to challenge him...</i>

262
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,034
<i>even after the bell rings.
This man's a contender.</i>

263
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,431
<i>Even though he's running him,
the guy's challenging him all the way.</i>

264
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,918
<i>One of the reasons
Jermaine looks so good tonight...</i>

265
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,311
<i>is because he's in against
better opposition than before...</i>

266
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,876
<i>Kid, behind you.</i>

267
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,230
<i>Sorry.</i>

268
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,430
<i>What do I do?
Find him.</i>

269
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,189
Hello?

270
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,033
You left four messages.
This better be important.

271
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,350
- I want to pick up the waffle iron.
- Four calls for a waffle iron?

272
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,636
<i>I always make waffles
on the weekend.</i>

273
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,628
And, I want to keep up some degree
of normalcy amidst all this chaos.

274
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,791
Ever heard of Wal-Mart, Julia?

275
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,391
You're being so hateful, Sean.
I don't even know who you are.

276
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,630
<i>Yeah, maybe I'm tired of being nice,
Julia.</i>

277
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,472
Nice didn't keep you from betraying me.

278
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,632
Nice didn't keep my family together.
I want to try something new.

279
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,951
Don't flatter yourself. You were never nice.
You were just repressed.

280
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,634
You were pushing down love,
you were pushing down anger.

281
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,910
You want anger? How about this?

282
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,476
<i>No need to go crazy. Do
you know what he says? "You lead inside. "</i>

283
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,393
<i>The best thing you can do
when you land that shot to the head?</i>

284
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,553
<i>Two to the body. There's nothing
more demeaning. It just...</i>

285
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,950
<i>breaks it down, okay?</i>

286
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,519
Your wife is such a bitch.

287
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,989
I know.

288
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,475
You need a woman who doesn't talk back.

289
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,473
You need a woman who lets you
take out all the anger...

290
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,515
on her.

291
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,233
Sean, stop.

292
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,919
Give it to me, baby.

293
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,638
Hang on, God damn it.

294
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,828
I'm so sorry, Sean.

295
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,833
My doll makers need the prototype back
by 9:00 a. m. tomorrow...

296
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,638
for the Vegas retail show.

297
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,234
I called your offices
and I was told you had it here.

298
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,995
I called several times, so I just
thought I'd swing by just in case.

299
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,519
- You okay?
- Just a little surprised is all.

300
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,799
- Did you put in the new vagina?
- No.

301
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,790
Then why does she look
so disheveled?

302
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,154
This is really embarrassing, Kimber.

303
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,032
I had a little fun with it.

304
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,989
How was it?

305
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,759
Don't you think it's strange
that I made it with a doll?

306
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,593
I think there'd be something wrong
with you if you didn't.

307
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,354
I mean,
she's here and you're alone.

308
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,708
<i>Who wouldn't?</i>

309
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,756
- Sean, what's wrong?
- I miss her.

310
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,037
- I just miss her.
- I know how you feel.

311
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,834
I miss Christian like that sometimes, too.

312
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,231
Why are you so nice to me?

313
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,877
Because you need it,
and because you were nice to me.

314
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,952
- That was out of line. I'm sorry.
- I'm not.

315
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,999
Oh, my God.

316
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,830
- I bet your Venus is in Scorpio.
- You think so?

317
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,070
Yeah, I'd put money on it.

318
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,750
So...

319
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,076
when you were making it with the doll,
what were you thinking of?

320
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,315
Honestly?

321
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,115
You.

322
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,679
That is so hot.

323
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,716
- All right, I'll go make coffee.
- No, I'll do it.

324
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,992
And you go take your shower.

325
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,030
- Where do you keep the coffee?
- In the freezer.

326
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,914
Hi. I'm Kimber.

327
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,118
I'm Julia. Sean's wife.

328
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,752
I've always heard such nice things
about you, Julia.

329
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,878
I'm really sorry about all this.

330
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,948
Sean...

331
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,590
Don't ignore her on my account, Sean.

332
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,832
Look, Sean, I kind of need my doll back.

333
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,515
Doll?

334
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,549
My doll.

335
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,158
Go wait in the car, honey.
I'll be out in a minute.

336
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,549
How long have you
been sleeping with her?

337
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,679
Oh, God.
I feel like I'm going to be sick.

338
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,835
Welcome to my world.
Doesn't feel good, does it?

339
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,910
I don't know why I'm surprised.

340
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,678
I should have left you
after I found out about Megan O'Hara.

341
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,037
You didn't have the guts
to kick me out, Julia. You know why?

342
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,873
Because I'm compassionate.
A quality you lack.

343
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,600
Bullshit. You didn't leave
so you'd have someone to blame...

344
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,512
for everything that's wrong in your life.

345
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,557
<i>I did you a favor by kicking you out.</i>

346
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,915
Now maybe you'll do
something with your life.

347
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,798
You should start by getting laid.

348
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,669
While you're attacking my choices, Sean,
you may want to have a look at yours.

349
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,355
If you don't want to think about me,
and about what we had, then fine.

350
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,193
But at least be a man
and think about your children.

351
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,352
They don't deserve to have whores
wandering about their home.

352
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,636
Kimber isn't a whore, Julia.

353
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,079
And unlike you, Kimber knows who she is.

354
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,391
Kimber takes away the pain.

355
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,957
Whoever you are...

356
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,552
tell Sean...

357
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,113
that I'm taking the waffle iron and...

358
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,112
that I'll drop Annie at home
on Sunday night.

359
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,712
Call to make sure I'm home.

360
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,872
I'm changing the locks
the minute you walk out that door.

361
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,275
Yeah, I want them out.
Just take them out.

362
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,836
As your surgeon, I'd like to know why.

363
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,310
- Is there pain, problems I'm unaware of?
- Sure, yeah, the pain sucks.

364
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,711
So does the pressure.
But this whole thing was just misguided...

365
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,111
and I'm sorry I put everyone through it,
okay? End of story.

366
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,633
I hope you haven't spent
your whole book advance.

367
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,396
- Do you have to give it back?
- Yes, he does.

368
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,235
The five electric adjustable beds
we bought for the hospice also.

369
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,072
I've said I'm sorry.

370
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,239
- My wife is pissed, as you can see.
- You could've given it a little more time.

371
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,992
Am I wrong? The pain will dissipate.

372
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,152
<i>Yeah, I write another book.
I'll call it Men Disappoint.</i>

373
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,114
Your husband has a point. Everyone has
their own level of tolerance for pain.

374
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,909
That's so him. To jump into things
without thinking of consequences...

375
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,957
and now to jump out of them
without thinking.

376
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,315
- It's my chest, my choice.
- I didn't have a choice.

377
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,155
- Wasn't that the point? To understand?
- Don't guilt me, Amy.

378
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,279
I feel like a freak. You're always
grabbing them, touching them. I hate it.

379
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,389
Maybe this brought up Mrs. Connors'
feelings about losing her own breasts.

380
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:55,633
Maybe your wife would like you to know
what she's feeling when you touch her.

381
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:00,553
I have the name of a very good counselor.
He's helped a lot of our patients.

382
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,035
That's not it.

383
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,994
Well, then what, Amy?
Why do you like my tits so much?

384
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,390
- What are you, a lesbian?
- I'm not sure.

385
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,029
Okay, what do you mean, you're not sure?

386
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,635
Have you always been a lesbian, since
that thing with your college roommate?

387
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,792
I told you when we met
that was the first and only time.

388
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,198
I don't know.
I honestly don't know what's happening.

389
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,952
These feelings are just...

390
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,471
Just happening.
I'm not asking for them, Ike.

391
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,271
I didn't see them coming.

392
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,954
That's rich.

393
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,516
I get these breasts so I can be more
in touch with my feminine side...

394
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,912
and what they've accomplished is putting
you more in touch with your inner dyke.

395
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,239
Nice prose, Ike.

396
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,154
You wonder why
you've never won the Pulitzer.

397
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,670
Not to get too personal, Mr. Connors...

398
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,549
but I've known men to embrace
their wives' attraction to other women.

399
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,757
If the lines are clearly drawn,
then it enhances their sex lives.

400
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:19,232
I don't want some freak-show marriage.
I want the real deal. I want Amy.

401
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,313
The old Amy.

402
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,754
My Amy.

403
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,751
Like I said, just take them out.

404
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,478
- Hello.
- Hi.

405
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,759
I'm Roger.

406
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,110
You like apple martinis, I see.

407
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,280
Well, I like the color more than the taste.

408
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,549
Hey, we'll take the most expensive
drink you have in green, all right?

409
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,036
- This is a really cool place.
- Yeah.

410
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,113
- I like the retro thing.
- Yeah, I like that, too.

411
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,591
I like staying here, you know,
when I'm in town on business.

412
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,356
The service is really good here.

413
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,234
Told you.

414
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,637
These drinks are so strong.

415
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,152
Feeling no pain, are we?

416
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,712
I'm feeling, believe me.

417
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,916
You know, if you like green drinks,
you really should try absinthe.

418
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,992
What's that?

419
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,355
What?

420
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,917
It's illegal, for starters.

421
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,436
It's like a liquid aphrodisiac.

422
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,680
Supposedly it makes you horny as hell.

423
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,029
I don't need absinthe to feel that way.

424
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,718
You know, if you like the decor so much,
maybe you'd like to see one of the rooms.

425
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,599
The check, please.

426
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,873
Oh, my God.

427
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,472
Let me get my thing, okay?

428
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,429
No, not yet. I like this part.

429
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,158
That is so cool
that you just said that. That's so hot.

430
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,832
Go get your thing.

431
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,190
Okay. All right.

432
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,238
Hey. Come here.

433
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,829
- What's this?
- That's the Black Thunder.

434
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,911
- Why do you have this?
- It's my fantasy...

435
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,755
to have a girl use it on me.
And you're that girl.

436
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,030
- Roger, I'm really not into this.
- Come on.

437
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,473
I'm not paying for straight sex, all right?
I can get that back home in Houston.

438
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,914
What are you talking about?

439
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,594
Come on. I'll give you $500, okay?

440
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,109
But for that,
I want some bang for my buck.

441
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,194
- I'm not a hooker.
- Come on, enough role playing.

442
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,679
Come on, put it on.

443
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,749
Like I told you, you've got... Let go!

444
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,353
Let go of me!

445
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,432
Put it on, you little tease.
All right, you want to play rough?

446
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,433
Fine, we'll play rough.
What do you want? An extra $250?

447
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,232
Let go of me!

448
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,474
Come on,
don't call security, all right?

449
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,914
Go.

450
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,515
You're being
particularly chipper today.

451
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,910
You in a good mood
because it's quitting time?

452
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,152
Actually, Christian, I got laid.
I got laid good.

453
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,790
Good for you.
I slept with Kimber.

454
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,750
How much did you pay her?
15-blade.

455
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:48,069
I was an animal with her.
I didn't think I had it in me.

456
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,117
I didn't think I was that guy.

457
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,677
Anyway, I wanted you to know.

458
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,153
I cannot believe you, Sean.

459
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,038
You discarded her
like a piece of trash.

460
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,953
Are you getting territorial?
Not at all, hypocrite.

461
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,156
Feast on my sloppy seconds
for all I care.

462
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,275
Why am I the hypocrite?

463
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,715
All I've heard
out of your puckered mouth...

464
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,518
is how horrible it is that I bang patients.

465
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,511
Remember,
my outrage was directed...

466
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,069
at how you treated them
after you banged them.

467
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,754
It's a pity you didn't learn
from my errors.

468
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,350
You can't stand to see Kimber
moving on. That's what's bothering you.

469
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,192
You treat women like shit.

470
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,358
Thinking about her with me
just rubbed your face in it.

471
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,473
You're just bitter,
and trying to settle the score.

472
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,433
I think I already did.

473
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,153
Julia's on the phone.
I'm in surgery. Take a message.

474
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,550
And then throw it away.
She's crying.

475
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,394
- Where's my wife?
- Your wife?

476
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,034
Okay, look, I did not know this, all right?
I thought she was a hooker.

477
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,954
What? My wife just locked herself in
your bathroom. She said you were violent.

478
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,430
Listen, calm down, all right?
Your wife asked me if I wanted to get laid.

479
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,795
- You're full of shit.
- I thought she was a hooker!

480
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,952
Perfectly reasonable assumption.
She picked me up in a hooker bar.

481
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:18,272
We get up here and I take my toy out
and she just wigs out. Listen, I'm sorry.

482
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,238
I'm sorry if I was insensitive.

483
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,109
If you don't want people to think
you're a hooker, you shouldn't act like one.

484
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,829
You look like the kind of asshole
who thinks all women are hookers.

485
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,549
Okay.

486
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,838
I'm going for a nightcap.

487
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:38,593
Just get your wife out of my bathroom.
Take her home.

488
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,630
Oh, my God, Sean.

489
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,154
I'm so sorry.

490
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,958
What were you thinking, Julia?

491
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:00,749
Look, just get me out of here.
I'll explain in the car.

492
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,113
I get it. I totally get it.
It's just another waffle iron.

493
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,757
You can't have me,
you can't let go...

494
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,673
so you're going to keep finding ways
to prey on my sympathy.

495
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,273
Throw yourself in front of me.

496
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,193
Make me come and pick up
the pieces of your sad little life.

497
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,352
Oh, yeah, right.
Like I wanted you to see me like this.

498
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,396
You know what? All I wanted was just...

499
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,838
a good, old-fashioned,
mindless sexual encounter.

500
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,229
How am I any different from you, Sean?

501
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,030
I didn't call you
sobbing and begging you to come get me.

502
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,319
Take a taxi home.

503
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,950
And for God's sake, get yourself
cleaned up before Annie sees you.

504
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,991
<i>Hey, Sean. It's me, Kimber.</i>

505
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,512
<i>I had to go to Orlando for a convention,
so I left you the next best thing.</i>

506
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,634
<i>Brand-new, improved Miss Kimber doll.</i>

507
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,309
<i>Enjoy.</i>
