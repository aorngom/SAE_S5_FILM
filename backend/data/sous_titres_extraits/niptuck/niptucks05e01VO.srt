Nip/Tuck Season 5 Episode 1

3
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,950
Down by 5, partner. Think
you can get inside of me now?

4
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,280
Hey, that's a foul.

5
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,180
Now, look, real men don't cheat.

6
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,640
They do if they wanna win.

7
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,960
Face it, partner. You can't dominate me.

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,420
Never have. Never will.

9
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,080
Come on. You're just
gonna scuff the new floor.

10
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,780
Who cares? It's not like we got
patients in here to complain.

11
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,350
Yes!

12
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,300
It's been 2 months without
even a botox shot, christian.

13
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,370
So far,the only thing I have to show for opening a
new practice in los angeles is a better hook shot.

14
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,550
I wouldn't go that far.

15
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:39,290
- Look,we both knew it wasn't gonna be easy,right?
- Yeah.

16
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,600
But it's not like we can start up in a strip mall, hand
out fliers hoping people will come through the door.

17
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,830
- Worked the first time we started a business together.
- At 25,baby.

18
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,940
At 40,you gotta go all out.

19
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,210
We owned miami, right?

20
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,970
- Yeah.
- Right?

21
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,760
So sooner or later, we're gonna
make this town our bitch, too.

22
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,170
Speak o'the devil.

23
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,750
Repo man.

24
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,072
He's in your office.

25
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,500
Repo man?

26
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,350
Sorry, doc. You haven't paid your bill.

27
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,130
But I just sent a check last week.

28
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,150
And it bounced higher than
hendrix was at woodstock.

29
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,990
You can't kidnap our fish.

30
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,850
Can't work for free either.

31
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:35,080
If I stop comin'to clean the
tanks,the little guys go belly up.

32
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,230
Oh, I'll tell you what.

33
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,890
I don't wanna terrorize the little aqua
dudes here,and they're just settlin'in.

34
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,690
I'll give you a week.

35
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,030
- Cool?
- Cool.

36
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,260
I knew this was a mistake.

37
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:55,530
I knew investing all our settlement money from michelle into
a rodeo drive sinkhole was gonna bite us right in the ass.

38
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,540
Perhaps you could save your ass by selling off
that disgustingly extravagant malibu beach pad.

39
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,560
No way. Image is
everything in this town.

40
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,570
Besides, if I sell the malibu compound, where's my partner
gonna stay, huh, in your hideous silver lake one bedroom?

41
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:12,240
I'm only bunking with you because I'm up
to my ass in alimony and child support.

42
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,200
- You're gonna need a bigger boat.
- What?

43
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,210
Jaws, first time brody sees the shark.

44
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:22,500
You guys are in over your heads.

45
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,990
You're chum being devoured by
all the rodeo drive great whites.

46
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,356
You gotta have faith, lizzie.
The patients will come.

47
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,230
Faith ain't gonna cut
it out here, christian.

48
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:37,120
You want the hollywood dream, you gotta go
out and get it, not wait to be discovered,

49
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:43,250
so get up off your asses and go get
some. Get some tits while you're at it, too.

50
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:50,710
Necks,chins,sagging vaginas. This
is los angeles,for god's sake.

51
00:04:52,455 --> 00:04:57,300
I think lizzie's right. We need to
go on a fishing expedition of our own.

52
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,020
What are we gonna use as bait?

53
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,540
Us.

54
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,940
- What's the plan?
- Divide and conquer.

55
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,090
Dr. Christian troy, plastic surgeon.

56
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:38,520
Actors are judged by their appearance. Maybe we
could freshen you up a bit for your next audition.

57
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,760
That is so sweet, but I get all
my work done with Dr. Eskandarian.

58
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,810
Dr. Thayer did my chin implant.

59
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:47,827
My lips.

60
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,250
My vagina.

61
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,540
My tits.

62
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,390
He does all the big stars. He actually shaved
down the bump on my nose a few months ago.

63
00:06:55,578 --> 00:06:58,810
- You ever done anyone famous?
- Uh,we almost worked on joan rivers.

64
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,900
Sean: Something wrong?

65
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,490
It's just that most guys your age who
come in wearing suits like that are agents.

66
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,870
Mine just dropped me, so
I was hoping you were one.

67
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:11,810
I'm the west coast editor of us weekly. If
you ever do someone important, give me a call.

68
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,970
It's anonymous.

69
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,250
Jesus. Has anyone in this
town not had plastic surgery?

70
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,080
I feel like I'm tryin'to
sell semen at a whorehouse.

71
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,690
Uncut flesh 11:00.

72
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,400
Hi. I'm Dr. Christian troy.

73
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,530
- This is my partner.
- Dr. Sean mcnamara. We're plastic surgeons.

74
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:49,138
I. I've always resisted
getting anything done.

75
00:07:49,298 --> 00:07:51,480
Well, maybe you haven't
met the right surgeons yet.

76
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,090
- We're new in town,from miami.
- Miami,yeah.

77
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,520
We'd love you to come in for a consult.

78
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,400
- Free consult.
- Free consult.

79
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,610
And then will I be happy?

80
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,860
Well.

81
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,620
You're both cute as clams, and I don't
know how they do business in miami,

82
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:13,070
but in hollywood, trolling for business at a nightclub
isn't a savvy marketing technique. It's pathetic.

83
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:17,430
And if you wanna make it in this town,you're gonna
have to do a better job of selling yourselves.

84
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,810
What makes you the expert, huh?

85
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,545
See those blondes over there?

86
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,740
The one on the right is a client of mine. She's
got as many gold records as she has trips to rehab.

87
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,820
That's her mother buying her shots.

88
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:35,850
I'm here to keep an eye on her, make sure she doesn't completely
destroy the image I worked my ass off creating for her.

89
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:37,570
Fiona mcneil,

90
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,340
publicist.

91
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,730
I think our credentials
speak for themselves.

92
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,072
Been written up in the new england journal of medicine
3 times, plastic reconstructive surgery journal twice.

93
00:08:48,232 --> 00:08:52,140
And how many times have you been
written up in people magazine,hotshot?

94
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,240
You can't spit in this town without
hitting a plastic surgeon from harvard.

95
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,350
It's not what you've done. It's whom.

96
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,950
Celebrity is power.

97
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:04,560
Well, we're screwed. We can't get a celebrity
until we've operated on a celebrity.

98
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,120
- Or become celebrities yourself.
- You mean advertise?

99
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:12,210
Anyone can advertise, but not
everyone can get exposure.

100
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,500
What's the difference?

101
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,940
Difference is you don't look
like the one placing the ad.

102
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:23,500
That's publicity. That's what I do better
than anyone in this town for 5,000 a month.

103
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,700
We don't have it.

104
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:31,280
Too bad, puppy,'cause I have a unique opportunity
that would fit you guys like a surgeon's glove.

105
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,450
We've got it.

106
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:37,380
- What is it?
- Hearts 'n scalpels.

107
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,680
You guys don't watch television?

108
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,960
Hearts' scalpels is a fantastic
new series about plastic surgery.

109
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:53,890
The show runner happens to be a client of mine, and he's looking
for a medical adviser to help him with the technical stuff.

110
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,440
Are you saying that being on a
tv show would give us credibility?

111
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,350
Bingo. I think he's got it.

112
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,230
Bet you never seen a view
like this, have you, baby?

113
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,580
It's so beautiful.

114
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,284
I think I can see all the way to canada.

115
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,660
That's not the view I'm talkin'about.

116
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:24,100
Oh, Dr. Clift. I don't know about this.

117
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,900
I'm just a first. year
plastic surgery resident.

118
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,690
Oh,and I'm just
showin'
you how I operate.

119
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,970
Think of me as your first lesson.

120
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,780
They should just be honest
and rename this show shit.

121
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,910
Shit.

122
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,390
You're so hot.

123
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,710
Who is this aidan stone douche? He's hilarious. He's
ridiculous. He thinks he's james bond or something.

124
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,630
He's not even that good.
looking. I'm hotter than he is.

125
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,380
We're sailin'on the water,baby.

126
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,240
You're sailin' with the doctor.

127
00:11:01,407 --> 00:11:03,210
This is really bad.

128
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,460
- It's pretty good.
- Real bad.

129
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,600
- I don't even know what you're lookin'.
- It's entertaining.

130
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,500
Yeah?

131
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,810
Car accident?

132
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,360
I'll be there in 10.

133
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,710
10 orgasms.

134
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,110
It is pretty fun.

135
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,550
***

136
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,550
You think they know it's funny?

137
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,240
Supposed to be like a drama, right?

138
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,440
Removed her cheek implants from her esophagus. She's
still gonna need a complete facial reconstruction here.

139
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,830
Where's the doctor? Where is the doctor?

140
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,620
Someone call for a plastic surgeon?

141
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,040
What the hell is this? They
don't wear masks or hats?

142
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,930
You're gonna be fine. 10 blade.

143
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,400
She's crashing! Oh, god!
Get the crash cart!

144
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,150
- Stat!
- Give me the paddles. Give me paddles. Stat.

145
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,490
- Paddles!
- Let's go. Paddles.

146
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,720
- All right,put it up to 380.
- 380. 380.

147
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,170
Clear.

148
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,480
Sean: Look at those tits.

149
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,899
- All right,all right,360.
- 360.360!

150
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:11,450
- No,no,no. 460. 460.
- Four.460!

151
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,310
-Clear!
-Clear!

152
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,140
Nothing! 580, now!

153
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,380
Man,come on.

154
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,840
Look. Look at that.

155
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,330
Get rid of these. Get rid of these.

156
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,280
- I want one milligram of epi right now.
- Epi. Gram.

157
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,890
- Doctor. Stat.
- All right. Stat.

158
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,378
- I said you,doctor.
- I. I'm doing it.

159
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,780
Not on my watch. I'm not losing another
one. I am not losing another one.

160
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,880
I sure hope she can sing in her
daughter's wedding on saturday.

161
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,620
Doctor, I want you to go
outside to the waiting room.

162
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,150
I want you to tell her daughter that I am not
gonna ruin her wedding. Do you understand me?

163
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,260
- I understand.
- Now!

164
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,130
And I wanna see a little
better bedside manner next time!

165
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,760
We're savin'a life today,guys.

166
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,640
We're all here for it. We are
saving a life today, people.

167
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,930
Christian: Her face completely healed in 3 days.
I mean,the whole thing was wildly unrealistic.

168
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:59,340
Being linked to that show could
destroy our professional reputations.

169
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,360
We'll get referrals.
We'll find patients.

170
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,140
- We're not that desperate,are we?
- Maybe not,boys.

171
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,290
Our first consult's in sean's office.

172
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,980
Tell us what you don't like
about yourself, Mr. Gorchek.

173
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,100
Oh, that's ok. You can
use my real name. I just.

174
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,640
I said that so your secretary
wouldn't post me on defamer.

175
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,932
That just proves my
instincts were. dead on.

176
00:13:25,092 --> 00:13:28,330
That's why I came to you guys
and not one of the big surgeons.

177
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:31,330
Bob easton ring a bell?

178
00:13:31,974 --> 00:13:35,943
Chairman, chief executive officer
of the biggest studio in town.

179
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:39,980
Quarterly profits never been higher.
My movies are smart and entertaining.

180
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:44,100
Well, we're delighted you chose
us, Mr. Easton. What can we do for you?

181
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:49,220
I'm gonna be spending the holidays at the four
seasons in kona. The entire town's gonna be there.

182
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:51,570
Need you guys

183
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,100
to make these invisible
by the time I'm poolside.

184
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,910
It's where I do the bulk of my
business for the next fiscal year.

185
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,400
Did you have a run. in with a dog?

186
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,330
When my mistress puts my
collar and leash on, I'm the dog.

187
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:09,560
- Your dominatrix inflicted these?
- Yeah,and she's not cheap either.

188
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:17,300
Still,no scotch,no yoga class,no hot rock therapy
ever helped me like mistress dark pain does.

189
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,750
Sounds like living the
dream has its price.

190
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,930
Of course it does.

191
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:26,920
Eat your young on a regular
basis, what do you expect?

192
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,950
All day long, I'm the one
with the control, the power.

193
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,650
When sweet mistress dark pain
takes it all away from me,

194
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:43,620
sometimes twice during oscar season, every bite
somehow restores the balance, keeps me real, you know?

195
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,550
Anyway,how soon can we
get it taken care of?

196
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:51,090
We're,uh,pretty booked up this
week. How'out next tuesday?

197
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:55,210
Please, this place is deader than
my nana. Today. Make it happen.

198
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,780
Thought we left miami so we didn't
have to deal with freaks like this guy.

199
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,030
- One client at a time,chri.
- Bullshit,sean.

200
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,170
I'm a jackrabbit. I
don't do slow and steady.

201
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,350
I paid my dues, and i want
some overnight success.

202
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,600
Out of the way,wiggy. You'll
lose a lot more than your head.

203
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,550
Jesus. You have no idea how stressful
it can be running a television show.

204
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,590
Everybody wants you.

205
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:32,600
Everybody's relying on you, you know, the studio, the
network. Rose bowl parade, they want me on a float.

206
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,650
God, the steering on this thing is so tight.
It's germanic or something. It's brand. new.

207
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:39,240
Anyway,fiona recommends
you guys very,very highly.

208
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,940
She's been very helpful to us
since our move out here from miami.

209
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:46,390
I think she heard about our more prestigious cases and
thought that us working together might be mutually beneficial.

210
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,520
Watch it, spartacus!
It's not a soccer field.

211
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,870
Look, there's achilles, too. Get it?

212
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,700
So,listen. I have a very important
question I need to ask you.

213
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,570
Scale of 1 to 10, what
do you think of my show?

214
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,730
- 5.
- 10.

215
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,650
Sorry. It's just from a medical
standpoint, the procedures look really phony.

216
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,130
Who's the lead guy? I
mean,he's totally unrealistic.

217
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:09,350
Women 18 to 49, they love aidan stone.

218
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,580
And he has a huge
following amongst the gays.

219
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,960
But I don't know, you know. Sounds like
maybe this isn't the right show for you guys.

220
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:24,640
Not only could we make your medical stuff more realistic. We
could give you examples of cases we've worked on for 15 years.

221
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,440
It'd give you credibility.

222
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:30,580
What the hell is this shit, freddie?
A musical episode? How gay is that?

223
00:16:30,778 --> 00:16:34,080
Come on. This is the kind of desperate
schlock you don't do until your fifth season.

224
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,200
I thought. I thought.

225
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,130
What? What'd you think?
No. No, no, you didn'T.

226
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:43,540
No,you didn't think,'cause you're too busy parading around in
that god. ugly jumpsuit like some faggy fat. ass chorus girl.

227
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:49,690
Why don't you just fire those hackity. hack writers before
I quit and you're forced to start running craft service.

228
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:56,440
I mean, look at your body. What happened to the
program I set up for you? It is so depressing.

229
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,560
Uh,so where were we?

230
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,410
You gonna let that son of a
bitch talk to you that way?

231
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:08,390
Who? Oh, aidan?

232
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,550
He's a sweetie. You know, he's, um.

233
00:17:11,735 --> 00:17:16,940
sensitive, and he's
damaged, and, um, you know, he's a.

234
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,410
he's frustrated.

235
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,410
Are you all right?

236
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:26,350
Just got low blood sugar, and I
need to eat something right now.

237
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,730
Ok, wheat, sugar, poo, poo, crap.

238
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:35,350
Paco, why is everything
still fried? Still?

239
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,210
I'm getting tits like a girl.

240
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:41,970
Truth is aidan's right. I'm in
over my head, way over my head.

241
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:49,130
Start production on episode 6 on tuesday, and I have no case, and I
can't keep ripping off episodes of chicago hope. They'll start suing me.

242
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:52,280
I need something sexy.
I need a ratings grabber.

243
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,320
Jesus christ. Chicken
fingers. Goddamn it.

244
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,100
Well, we had a case a couple
of years ago. Remember, sean?

245
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:03,260
This, uh, woman came into our office. She'd
burned her lips off in a cooking accident.

246
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,320
Right. We had to do a graft
using skin from her vagina.

247
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:12,630
The only trouble was her husband didn't like oral sex, so
she couldn't let him know where the skin came from.

248
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:15,400
We called her pussy lips.

249
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,050
I'd watch a show with pussy lips on it.

250
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,930
How soon can you start?

251
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,160
We're not interested in just
being consultants, Mr. Prune.

252
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:35,290
- We're not?
- We want producer credits and the occasional line.

253
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,747
Pussy lips.

254
00:18:39,907 --> 00:18:41,582
God, I love it.

255
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,030
Let's get to work.

256
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,150
Let me start off by
saying I'm a huge fan.

257
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:07,060
Of all the romantic comedies I've been dragged to by my
girlfriends over the years, yours are the ones I hated the least.

258
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,620
So,tell me what you don't
like about yourself,ms.Summers.

259
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:17,380
Um, that I was stupid enough
to let fiona drag me here.

260
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:23,940
Look, doctor, I am sure you are a genius at what you
do, but plastic surgery is an actor's worst nightmare.

261
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,030
You stretch actors'faces so they
don't have to stretch themselves.

262
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:31,450
Says the woman who hasn't landed a part
deeper than a shot glass in 3 years.

263
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,930
Face it, carly. No one wants to see a
40. year. old woman in romantic comedies.

264
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:40,390
If she looks 35, maybe.

265
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,490
Show business is rough on you.

266
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,090
It's hard to find someone in this
town who'll be honest with you.

267
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,320
Which is why we came to you, Dr. Troy.

268
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,960
You're a fellow client.
We can trust you.

269
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:58,230
Tell us how you can refresh carly's
face so we can refresh her career.

270
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:05,560
Well, let's start out on
the right foot, shall we?

271
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,720
Tell me,do you want cosmetic surgery?

272
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:15,170
Look, I'm up for this really great part. single
mother, coal miner, with an autistic child.

273
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,180
and even if I don't get it, a
part of me wants to take a stand.

274
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:24,250
I want to show everyone that a woman my age
can be desirable without the help of science.

275
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:32,130
Sweetheart, you have a lovely little talent, and you
make the most of it, but you've got 5 years left,

276
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:36,800
and that's only if you let Dr.
Troy work his medical magic.

277
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:43,650
Well, maybe I can start out with that
restylane or botox, you know, ease me into it.

278
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,210
What do you think, Dr. Troy?

279
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,160
- Honestly.
- Yes.

280
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,760
I don't think you need anything done.

281
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,940
Maybe a nice dinner by the beach, a great
bottle of burgundy, and some decent conversation.

282
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:13,380
Aw,look at you,beautiful boy.

283
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,820
Where are you goin'?

284
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,420
I'm taking carly to the ivy.

285
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,620
- Did you call a sitter?
- No,but you're not doing anything.

286
00:21:23,620 --> 00:00:00,-081
Come on. It's business.

287
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,260
I thought you turned down her surgery.

288
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,460
I did turn down her surgery.
Now I need to turn her on.

289
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,400
We're not gonna get anywhere in this town
by giving carly summers a little botox.

290
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,940
She needs a face. lift, a tit job, and
whatever else I can seduce her into getting.

291
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,670
Good plan,huh?

292
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:44,120
How'out I take the hollywood star out to
dinner and you stay home with your son?

293
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,200
I'll do the convincing.

294
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,120
Because I'm the charismatic salesman, and you're
the talent. That's the way it's always been.

295
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,430
Exactly why I left miami.

296
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,660
What are you, a camel?

297
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:01,530
Pineapple juice, baby. Makes a man's
shooty. shoot taste infinitely sweeter.

298
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,450
It's nature's guarantee
of a second date.

299
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,370
Now, if you were any kind of
salesman, you would have known that.

300
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,510
Come on, the next america's sweetheart
who comes into our office is all yours.

301
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,880
Why didn't you hire a live. in
nanny like you said you would?

302
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,500
I can't afford it now that we're
paying fiona 5 grand a month.

303
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,430
Good night. I love you.

304
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,410
Christian.

305
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,190
Hello.

306
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,120
Liz, slow down. I can't understand you.

307
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:43,340
You think you're a great
big barracuda, don't you?

308
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:48,170
Well,I can jerk you like you're a guppy.

309
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,860
Get out of here!

310
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,380
What the hell are you doing? Stop it.

311
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,130
I want you to pack up and get out.

312
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,060
- Or what?
- Or I'm calling the police.

313
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,260
Course I sterilize. I'm a professional.

314
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,310
What's going on with you?
This is out of control.

315
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,920
***

316
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,100
You need therapy.

317
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,260
I had to call her, ok?

318
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,930
I had to fire 5 people today by e. mail.

319
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,790
This is a medical facility, Mr.
Easton, not a bedroom.

320
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,070
Or a dungeon.

321
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:32,150
One of them was my oldest friend out here.
You know I'm godfather to his daughter?

322
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:35,710
There's this whole corporate merger
in the wind. Everything's shifting.

323
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,790
You are not in charge here.

324
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:42,740
You talk when I say you can talk.

325
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:47,840
Let me tell you something, doctor.
It's not easy being robert easton.

326
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,190
He isn't stupid.

327
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:58,730
He knows that underneath his "look how big my dick is" act that he's
just a scared little boy who feeds off everyone else's talent and dreams.

328
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:01,180
He's nothing.

329
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:07,610
I have a gift. I help keep men like
bob from imploding with too much power.

330
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,790
Let me tell you
something, mistress whomever.

331
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:14,040
You and your gift are not welcome
here. This is a place of healing.

332
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,530
You'd be fun to work with.

333
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,830
See you later, bobby.

334
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:42,200
So next time,maybe we should
meet at the restaurant first.

335
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:47,010
Really? How come? You
didn't like our first date?

336
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,610
I did. Trust me.

337
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,890
Trust you? Aren't you an actress?

338
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,910
How could I trust an actress?

339
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,940
I need to see for myself.

340
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,570
- No,you don'T.
- Oh,come on.

341
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,130
- No.
- What are you doing?

342
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,450
Oh, my god.

343
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:15,780
Why are you being so
shy all of a sudden?

344
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:23,930
Look, I took over an hour getting ready for you, and, you know, you barely
saw it, and now my hair is a wreck, and my makeup is all smeared, and.

345
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,580
Makeup?

346
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,220
After the first time we met, I, uh.

347
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:32,660
I got the impression that you were
very confident with your appearance.

348
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,020
I am. I just.

349
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,460
I've just never slept with
a plastic surgeon before.

350
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:48,470
Oh, god. Imagine it's worse
than a casting director.

351
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,380
Please.

352
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:55,150
You think I'm judging
the way that you look now?

353
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:58,190
You're beautiful.

354
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,750
- What?
- God,you and the light.

355
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,480
What?

356
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,910
I've never seen that before.

357
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,010
It's an original andrew macpherson.

358
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:28,970
- You know his work?
- I have his book.

359
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:36,270
- Can you believe that was taken almost.
- 18 years ago,give or take 6 months.

360
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,350
How do you know that?

361
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:40,960
They didn't airbrush back
then like they do today.

362
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,170
I don't think I look that different.

363
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,550
Do you?

364
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,950
Not at all.

365
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:56,910
Well, say I was gonna do that
exact same picture today.

366
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:01,700
Like,would you have to fix anything
to make me look like that again?

367
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,710
Do you have a lipstick?

368
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:09,910
Yeah.

369
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,130
Starting at the bottom.

370
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:34,210
The muscles in your calves and thighs, they soften after a woman turns 40, so
I'd give you calf implants and, uh, liposuction through here and through here.

371
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,930
Of course some liposuction right here.

372
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:41,930
Now your boobs are still really
perky, so I'd just maybe take 'em to a.

373
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,450
a high "b" and lift them just a
little bit. Now here the hard part.

374
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:51,680
A feather. lift would take 6
years off the way you look now.

375
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,940
Through here, here.

376
00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:04,330
The good news is if you get that coal miner
role, nobody'll notice your ass in overalls, right?

377
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,980
Let's focus,people.

378
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,480
I need a bruschetta, stat, extra cheese.

379
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,450
Ok, what the heck? Where
are your pussy lips?

380
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,180
I thought we were shooting.
Where are her pussy lips?

381
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,290
No, you said we were just rehearsing.

382
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,310
Oh, god, of course. I'm
sorry. I'm an asshole.

383
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,800
What's this? Why's.

384
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,730
what is this buck rogers bullshit, ok? I know
it's real and everything, but can we spray it?

385
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:37,630
- Freddie?
- Yes,dear.

386
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:43,590
I just need to know,should i scream and break
down and be terrified that I'm gonna die?

387
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,790
Like this. Watch.

388
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:52,590
I'm so terrified I'm gonna die.

389
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:00,140
Don't look at me like you just stepped in dog
shit, freddie. I'm just trying to give this thing some color.

390
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,600
- Oh,honey,I'm processing.
- All right.

391
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,110
I mean,don't you think we should just
see her,you know,resist and resist,

392
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:10,750
and then she should slowly reveal that when
she was a little girl, she was sexually abused.

393
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:13,270
All right,let's do
it. Let's get it done.

394
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,050
- I feel good.
- Great. Great.

395
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,320
- Claude,sides stat,please.
- Over here.

396
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,120
- Now,you take a 15 blade.
- All right.

397
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,950
- We'll just pantomime this for now.
- Ok.

398
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,990
But you hold it like this, and you
start by excising the burnt skin.

399
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,230
Freddie,we have to do
this real. life shit?

400
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:29,490
I don't wanna do all this real. life shit. I
mean, they're not tuning in to see my hands. It's more.

401
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,880
new idea. New idea.

402
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,670
I actually think it's a mistake to
underestimate the intelligence of your audience.

403
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:40,950
I think adding a little authenticity
could make a huge difference.

404
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,710
You know what? I
completely agree with you.

405
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,370
I mean, that's why I don't think she
should give in so easily, you know.

406
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:49,220
I mean, I. I think I should
be flailing around, like.

407
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:56,690
- And then you should tie me down.
- With what?

408
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:57,880
With some ropes.

409
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,370
- Do you know what's so magic for me?
- What?

410
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:03,110
- Is when I get to watch you listen.
- I can do that.

411
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,360
You know, you'll need a cap on when
we're doing the surgery scenes.

412
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,580
You could look ridiculous
when you don't wear a cap.

413
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,290
- Claude,caps,stat.
- No,no. 86 that.

414
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,650
Do you see this? See this hair?

415
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,600
Yeah? This is why people tune in.

416
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,170
Ok, if i was balding in the temples
like you, it'd be a different story.

417
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:25,770
- Excuse me?

418
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:29,930
- Why don't we just rehearse the
basic moves so it looks more real,ok?

419
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,300
Just. just if you could see
the. you make the cut here.

420
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,250
Hey, doc, you're a technical
advisor, ok? You are not the director.

421
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:40,940
Freddie, why is it that we're in the plastic surgery capital of the world, and
we're forced to work with these miami wannabes? Can you tell me that?

422
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,850
You are not in charge here.

423
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,400
I have seen kids playing doctor who have
better surgical technique than you do.

424
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:59,630
I'm giving you an opportunity to be more
authentic. I would take it if I were you.

425
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,200
- Holding it just like that.
- Ok.

426
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,330
It's just some skin that's
right on the edge of the lip.

427
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,620
- So I just come in gently.
- Easy,easy.

428
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,910
- But don't really do it.
- Shh. Don't. don'T. Just breathe.

429
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,210
Just like a little crescent moon?

430
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:36,710
Game over, pally pal. We finally
have a real. life patient.

431
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,800
Ah, at least you do, anyway.

432
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,010
They specifically requested me?

433
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,400
Well, apparently you're the only one he
trusts to keep his peekaboo scalp a secret.

434
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:49,200
I can't believe you'll let me go in front of
millions of viewers showing off my shiny head.

435
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,310
The only time I see the top of
your head is when it's covered.

436
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:55,150
Well, if that asshole's not
wearing a cap, than neither am I.

437
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:58,350
Asshole's a vain narcissist
without a shred of integrity.

438
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,830
I know. He's a tv star.

439
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,720
What's on top of his head is more
important than what's in it. I get it.

440
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,750
It's hollywood, baby.

441
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,190
Plug me.

442
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,060
I'm sorry you didn't get the part.

443
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:25,750
Cameron diaz is 35.

444
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:29,130
She thinks being autistic
means you can paint.

445
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:32,860
But I guess she's easier
to light in a coal mine.

446
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,410
Which is why we're here.

447
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:38,690
- What's this?
- A confidentiality agreement.

448
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:42,720
No one can find about carly's surgery.

449
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:46,580
It's straight. You can sign it.

450
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,030
So what do we do first?

451
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:10,410
Uh, feather. lift, which only takes a few hours, so
we can do your breast augmentation at the same time.

452
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,890
Are you sure this is
something you'd wanna do?

453
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:18,210
I'd hate to see you bowing to the
superficial pressures of your industry.

454
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:25,920
- Is it going to hurt?
- No more than having your teeth cleaned.

455
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:33,350
How exactly does the lift work?

456
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,220
We begin by making a tiny
incision in your scalp.

457
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,810
Then we slide in
silicone cheek enhancers.

458
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:56,540
and then insert tiny threads into the
cheeks and pull the facial muscle tight.

459
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:03,340
For the record, I continue to
find your vanity ridiculous.

460
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,210
What are you gonna do
if this reads on camera?

461
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:12,410
Come on. You're the one who in the miami days told our clients that
microplugs are so realistic you can go back to work the next day.

462
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:17,950
What, I got. I got 3 days
before we shoot? Should be fine.

463
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:21,440
I need this.

464
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:34,430
Matt: Dear dad, enclosed, find a picture
of the new bambino. Her name is jenna.

465
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:39,260
Kimber named her after some sitcom
actress in the church I've never heard of.

466
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:42,580
I know you wanted to be there
to deliver my firstborn, dad.

467
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:48,110
I wanted that,too,but jenna came so quickly,there
wouldn't have been enough time for you to get here anyway.

468
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:51,870
I'm sorry I haven't returned your
calls. You know how busy fatherhood is.

469
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:55,030
And kimber's good.
She loves bein'a mom.

470
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,540
I miss you, dad.

471
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:02,170
Show christian the picture and tell him
I miss him, too. I love you guys. Matt.

472
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,080
Jesus christ!

473
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,910
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Look at this.

474
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,400
What? Let me see. Let me see.

475
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,540
- What is it?
- Folliculitis.

476
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:12,940
- Infection occurs in a small percentage of hair transplants.
- Weren't the instruments properly,uh.

477
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,990
This was probably caused by all that sweating
you did in the tanning salon yesterday.

478
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:19,070
I told you to stay away from
that until you're fully healed.

479
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:21,740
We need to look our
best, right? It's our big break.

480
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,380
Why don't you just
stay still? Come here.

481
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,720
Antiseptic cream or something?
But I'm gonna be all right, right?

482
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,050
- It's gonna be fine. It's fine.
- Right?

483
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,620
This was a mistake.

484
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,210
- It's just a minor infection.
- No,not your plugs.

485
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:44,080
Look at us, mutilating our bodies,
selling out to some hack tv show.

486
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,320
We're good surgeons.

487
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:50,550
Why live in a place that
doesn't appreciate us, you know?

488
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:57,750
Maybe we should've moved somewhere where
substance reigns over style, like new york.

489
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,730
Julia's gone.

490
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:03,420
Living a couple of subway stops
away ain't gonna change that.

491
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,960
I miss my kids.

492
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:16,730
I miss annie laughing at me when I
try to put her hair in a ponytail,

493
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:20,150
conor's first smile in the morning.

494
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:25,960
I miss seeing matt with
his child, our grandchild.

495
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,000
You can't get those moments back.

496
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,280
Look,

497
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:39,940
you made a bold move comin'out
here,partner,maybe the first one of your life.

498
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,810
Come on.

499
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:48,260
I mean, how many guys our age finally get the
opportunity to get the recognition they deserve?

500
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:52,500
This is just the beginning.

501
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,270
Fame isn't love, christian.

502
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:59,270
Getting it isn't gonna fill up some hole
you've had inside you since you were a kid.

503
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,430
She's beautiful.

504
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:16,600
She looks just like me.

505
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,740
I wanna be here, man.

506
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,860
I mean,look at this place.

507
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:36,600
I can't do it without you.

508
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:40,150
So,

509
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,450
you're gonna have to jump onboard,

510
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:46,800
'cause I ain't leavin'.

511
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:51,310
Come on.

512
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:53,250
Let's run some lines.

513
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:56,590
Not too much.

514
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,980
Freddie

515
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,940
, I got the rewrite. But
I don't understand.

516
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:06,620
If you didn't like the way I was saying the
line, why didn't you just tell me to my face?

517
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,010
No,darling,it's not you. You're gold.

518
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:10,920
I. it's the standards
and practices department.

519
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:18,330
You know, it's ok, you know, for tony soprano's best friend to be named pussy, but
we're television, not hbo, so we can't use the p. word on the network. That's all.

520
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:20,600
But I can't say that.

521
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:24,460
I mean, it doesn't sound
natural. Allegra's a grown woman.

522
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:29,320
I mean,only a child would
refer to her labia as a.

523
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:32,140
Candy, candy, candy, candy, she's
a victim of abuse, ok?

524
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:36,350
Any reference to her female parts
infantilizes her, ok? End of story.

525
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:39,100
Now,I want you to
play against the sound.

526
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:43,860
You wanna hear
somethin', freddie? You are right.

527
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,570
Oh,my god. You are a genius.

528
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:50,000
I'm infantilized.

529
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:54,130
Maybe i could gurgle like a baby, like.

530
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,350
Nana!

531
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,960
Are you ready for your
close. up, Dr. Mcnamara?

532
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:16,630
I don't know about you,but I feel like my whole
life has built up for this moment in time right now.

533
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:20,620
Do you realize that in one night, more people
will see us than we'll meet in a whole lifetime.

534
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,440
- What are you lookin' at?
- Nothing. Just.

535
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,470
I think you need a little
somethin'around the plugs.

536
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,190
Shit. Seriously?

537
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:31,000
Practically sprayed a whole
can of spray. paint on my head.

538
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,420
Well,they're pros. I'm sure they
know what they're talkin'about.

539
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,270
Tell me. You tell me.

540
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,490
No, it's ok. It's ok? It's fine.

541
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:37,040
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

542
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,860
"A" camera marker.

543
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:50,860
You don't understand. I can't
wear my lady cha. cha on my lips.

544
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,500
I just can'T.

545
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,440
It'll be a constant reminder of.

546
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:58,090
Of what, allegra?

547
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,920
You can tell me. I'm your doctor.

548
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:04,960
My father touched those lips.

549
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:11,120
He used to come into my room at
night when I was a little girl and.

550
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:15,120
- Let it out.
- And abuse me.

551
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:20,850
I just can't wear my shame on my face.

552
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,820
No one will know I put your
lady cha. cha on your face.

553
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,410
I'm gonna get a humanitas for this.

554
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,850
- You have my word.
- Doctor.

555
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,930
You were right, doctor.

556
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:35,670
What is that, another
surgeon, or is that a chia pet?

557
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:37,730
That's. that's disgusting.

558
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:39,800
Get. get off him.

559
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:47,440
Elastic fibers allow for less contraction
during the healing and recovery process.

560
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,890
She's ready when you are, doctor.

561
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:59,280
15 blade.

562
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,750
I'm pretty good at this.

563
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:06,070
Could hear a pin drop
when I was saying my lines.

564
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:08,370
What are you doing here?

565
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:16,250
Apparently the merger's official,and our little bobby has
been asked to be chairman and C.E.O. Of the parent company.

566
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:24,640
He's very excited, but
understandably a little stressed.

567
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,520
Who is that,man? She's kind of hot.

568
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:33,120
Bob easton's one.
woman stress management.

569
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,350
Mr. Easton, pull down the blanket.

570
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:42,510
I. I'm good.

571
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,840
In shock.

572
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,160
I'm good.

573
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:49,310
I need to examine your
sutures. Let go of the blanket.

574
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,070
Jesus.

575
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,910
It's not her fault.

576
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:59,060
She wanted to stop, but i
begged her to keep goin'.

577
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,740
I wanna thank you guys.

578
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,580
Lesser men would have
kicked me to the curb.

579
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:10,680
You know, I'm having a hard time understanding
how such a smart guy could be so stupid.

580
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:16,030
In addition to compromising our practice, you
have any idea what lives in the human mouth?

581
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:19,040
It's a cesspool. You
risked sepsis,hepatitis B.

582
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,750
I know. I know.

583
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:27,250
For the record, I decided
not to take the job. I'm out.

584
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:34,130
You know,it's only a matter of time
until this town eats you guys alive.

585
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:41,820
You may wanna pack up your scalpels and head
back to miami while your souls are still intact.

586
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,890
Count back from 10 for me.

587
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:48,390
10,9.

588
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:56,560
Oh, look.

589
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,480
That was a great idea. You see the face?

590
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,990
You don't understand.

591
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,710
I can't wear my lady
cha. cha on my lips.

592
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,710
Honey, if you can live with the shame
of calling your labia minora a lady cha.

593
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:13,460
chas,then you can paint 'em bright
orange and wear 'em on your forehead.

594
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:16,000
Of what, allegra?

595
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,720
I'm your doctor. You
can tell me anything.

596
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:24,630
My father touched those lips.

597
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,770
He used to come into my room at
night when I was a little girl and.

598
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:33,800
- Let it out.
- And abuse me.

599
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,690
Look, look. Daddy's gonna be on tv.

600
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:37,550
Oh,sean,look. You look really moved.

601
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:38,120
Hey, will you guys be.

602
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,720
- It was weird. I sort of was.

603
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,630
No one will know I put your
lady cha. cha on your face.

604
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:48,990
You have my word.

605
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:51,260
Doctor.

606
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,830
She's ready when you are, doctor.

607
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:02,490
what? Wait,wait.

608
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,570
Doctor.

609
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:14,250
She's ready when you are, doctor.

610
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:16,460
15 blade.

611
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,070
They cut out the whole speech.

612
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:25,760
Oh, no, you're not, not completely.

613
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,140
- I mean,the back of your head,very distinctive.
- This is that aidan stone.

614
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:32,540
- I'm tellin' you,he felt threatened by me,couldn't handle the heat.
- Come on,christian. It's just a stupid tv show.

615
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:37,490
What? Mcnamara/troy cannot be associated
with this kind of schlock, my friend.

616
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:39,850
We have a reputation to protect.

617
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:42,990
They can take this shitty show
and shove it up their asses.

618
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,910
We don't need that
kind of exposure, sean.

619
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,070
We got carly,and our work
will speak for itself.

620
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:51,530
You signed a confidentiality
agreement, remember?

621
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:53,600
- Yeah,yeah. Whatever.

622
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,050
Excuse me.

623
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,330
Didn't I see you last
night on hearts' scalpels?

624
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,740
Last night's episode was awesome.
Everyone is talking about it.

625
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:05,180
Look. It's the new cute
doctor from hearts' scalpels.

626
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,110
Oh, wow. You were great.

627
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,260
Well,actually I am.
They hired me to consult.

628
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,060
Hey, you're a real plastic surgeon?

629
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:14,880
- Yes,I.
- Do you have a card?

630
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:18,630
My wife's been hounding me to get some
work done. You must be pretty good.

631
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:21,770
Every surgeon in beverly hills
must have been after that job.

632
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:23,620
Here.

633
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,410
- Thanks.
- Sure.

634
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:32,520
Sure renault, right?

635
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:43,490
Lipo's a harsh procedure. The key is to use
short, even strokes and avoid excessive bruising.

636
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:49,350
That looks just so real when you do it.

637
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:51,240
This is real, remember?

638
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:54,960
Yeah,this is exactly how I want
the show to look from now on.

639
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:58,330
I went online the other night after we
aired and got our highest ratings ever.

640
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:02,070
You know what I kept reading about in
all the hearts' scalpel chat rooms?

641
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,270
Surgery.

642
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:06,840
They love the surgery.

643
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:10,830
Everybody thought that it brought a heightened
sense of realism and. and drama to the show.

644
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:12,430
- You're kidding.
- No,no.

645
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:16,630
- Me doing realistic surgery.
- You can't. can't do that.

646
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:19,740
Right. Right.

647
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:23,850
And you, my friend, you are the
guy that's gonna make that happen.

648
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:25,640
I'm just happy to do my part.

649
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:30,880
Speaking of which, I want to talk to you about what
happened on set the other day, how you spoke to me.

650
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,490
- Look,I didn't mean.
- Thank you.

651
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:36,680
I needed to hear it.

652
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,540
You know, it. it's hard being the
sole creative force behind a hit show.

653
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:47,520
Everything is riding on my broad shoulders
all the time, and the pressure gets to me.

654
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:52,600
- What's he doing here?
- Christopher.

655
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:55,910
Good to see you,my man.

656
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:59,440
Your better half's giving me some
pointers on the show. It's awesome stuff.

657
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,270
Listen, you have any notes in the
next script, you give me a call, ok?

658
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:03,520
Yeah.

659
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:06,620
We should do a meal soon.
You been to the ivy yet?

660
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,730
You got my digits, right?

661
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,200
Look at you. Look at you.

662
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,550
It's christian.

663
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:19,550
So what's he talkin'about?

664
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:23,880
I thought we agreed we
weren't doing the tv show.

665
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:26,520
I never committed to that.

666
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:30,020
You're the one who wanted to
quit because you were cut out.

667
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:37,160
- Is that the lady from.
- The hot dog stand. Yeah.

668
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:40,800
And some cold calls came in this
morning from fans of the show.

669
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,960
Great.

670
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:50,010
Now the ball's off and rolling, we don't
have to do that stupid, shitty tv show, right?

671
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:53,770
You can do what you want,but
I'm doin'the show,christian.

672
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:56,860
Fiona was right. It's good for business.

673
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:00,130
You mean it's good for your ego.

674
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:14,600
Everything's where it ought to
be, minimal bruising and swelling.

675
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:20,510
What is it?

676
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:24,700
Oh, I just didn't know it
was gonna hurt so much.

677
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:28,040
I could up your morphine if you like.

678
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,220
No. Uh.

679
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:33,400
Coming down off that stuff's A.

680
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,600
even bigger bitch.

681
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,260
I'm sorry.

682
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:43,120
I'm glad.

683
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,670
I needed to.

684
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,160
Right?

685
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:06,410
See if we can move
mrs. Siebert's brow. lift to 3:00.

686
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:11,120
That way, we can still fit in mrs. Kashoggi's
tummy tuck before she leaves for cabo.

687
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:15,910
Mrs.Kashoggi was very clear.

688
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,840
Seems like business
is finally picking up.

689
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,760
Do I need to take out a
restraining order? Leave.

690
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:25,730
I watched you on television
last night, doctor.

691
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,690
You were very handsome
and very convincing.

692
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:32,920
I can already tell you're gonna do
quite well for yourself in this town.

693
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:39,260
That's right, which means we don't need to
see you or your sicko clients any longer.

694
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,550
Have you seen today's variety?

695
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:44,220
This sicko has just climbed
up another rung on the ladder.

696
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:49,230
"Bob easton named C.E.O. After merger.

697
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,500
I guess the rush of power's just
too addictive to walk away from.

698
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:56,430
Call me.

699
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:59,120
I don't need your kind of help.

700
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,420
You will.

701
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:26,470
Us weekly. This is miranda speaking.

702
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:30,360
Guess who just got a face. lift.

703
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:33,680
Yes, that carly summers.

704
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:41,930
It doesn't matter who I am, but, uh, the surgeon
who did her work is Dr. Christian troy.
