00:00:00,975 --> 00:00:02,215
<i>Previously on Nip/Tuck...</i>

2
00:00:02,982 --> 00:00:05,155
- God!
- I'm not here because you're perfect.

3
00:00:05,295 --> 00:00:06,673
I'm here because you're you.

4
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:08,290
I think we should get married.

5
00:00:08,544 --> 00:00:10,676
- How do you know that girl?
- She's Olivia's daughter.

6
00:00:10,796 --> 00:00:12,346
What's your real fear, Sean,

7
00:00:12,745 --> 00:00:15,516
that I'll corrupt Annie
or that I'll corrupt you?

8
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:18,028
I've left Kimber, dad.
I've taken the baby.

9
00:00:18,249 --> 00:00:19,775
- Did you get it?
- 300$,

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,431
courtesy of my two dads.

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,397
Olivia said that the only way
I'd get you out

12
00:00:24,632 --> 00:00:26,293
of my system was to sleep with you.

13
00:00:26,422 --> 00:00:27,948
I guess she was right.

14
00:00:36,256 --> 00:00:38,029
This L.A. traffic, I tell you.

15
00:00:38,757 --> 00:00:40,448
I'm sorry, I'm late, mister Darling.

16
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:42,901
Call me Chaz and...

17
00:00:43,353 --> 00:00:45,419
You have nothing to apologize for,
doctor.

18
00:00:45,748 --> 00:00:48,402
You did not tell me he was
bringing sexy back that hard.

19
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:52,426
Eden, it's a surprise.

20
00:00:52,556 --> 00:00:54,563
Well I know, it's Chaz's consult.

21
00:00:54,951 --> 00:00:56,724
But, I have to come
and support my B.G.F.

22
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:00,810
- Best Gay Friend.
- Yeah. Well, every girl needs one.

23
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,894
Of course, I sort out as her stylist,

24
00:01:03,035 --> 00:01:05,043
and fashion consultant.

25
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,657
Does Sean know you're here?

26
00:01:06,773 --> 00:01:08,585
Well I thought we can keep
this our little secret.

27
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:11,392
So, McDreamy, why we came today ?

28
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,261
The left one

29
00:01:15,531 --> 00:01:17,821
was normal until I was like 15.

30
00:01:18,062 --> 00:01:19,952
Now, it's like it got all Britney on me.

31
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,781
*** can

32
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,999
affect nipple growth,
causin' to enlarge. It's not uncommon.

33
00:01:26,263 --> 00:01:28,318
In my world, it is. I mean, I...

34
00:01:28,499 --> 00:01:30,073
I don't want go to the beach or...

35
00:01:30,261 --> 00:01:32,879
sit by the pool or...
***

36
00:01:33,566 --> 00:01:36,314
- Not even after my checkups.
- That's where you come in.

37
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,498
I'd be happy to help.

38
00:01:43,451 --> 00:01:44,648
Dr Hecky is

39
00:01:44,883 --> 00:01:47,278
an excellent plastic surgeon.
Down aside in Monica.

40
00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:48,734
Good luck.

41
00:01:49,251 --> 00:01:51,728
I show you my shame
and you're kicking me out.

42
00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:55,691
Go get me a Perrier,
while I look this, OK?

43
00:01:59,234 --> 00:02:01,230
You're a mean one, Mr Grinch.

44
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:08,424
I know all about you.

45
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:10,403
And just because my partner
is a pushover,

46
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,685
when it comes to cock teaser like
yourself, doesn't mean that I am.

47
00:02:13,673 --> 00:02:16,303
So take your spoiled little rich girl
attitude and you're best gay freak,

48
00:02:16,796 --> 00:02:19,873
and go to somebody who cares.

49
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,017
You'll kick me out just based
on what Sean says?

50
00:02:22,293 --> 00:02:25,187
You two must be good friends to
share that kind of loyalty.

51
00:02:25,532 --> 00:02:28,566
No wonder he'd be devastated to
find out you slept with julia.

52
00:02:30,809 --> 00:02:34,445
I know about your little tryst
with Julia, Dr. Troy.

53
00:02:34,548 --> 00:02:37,233
The thing about living with
dykes, they're always sharing

54
00:02:37,287 --> 00:02:40,536
their emotions where us spoiled,
little rich kids can overhear.

55
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:44,706
Personally, I'm disappointed.

56
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:47,742
See, I thought all it would take
was some good dick

57
00:02:47,824 --> 00:02:50,243
to pull her back to
the hetero side, but...

58
00:02:50,352 --> 00:02:52,839
I guess you fell short in that regard.

59
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,884
You don't want to play this
game with me.

60
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,513
I don't play by the same rules as Sean.
You're going to get yourself hurt.

61
00:03:01,193 --> 00:03:03,161
Oh, like a spanking?

62
00:03:04,634 --> 00:03:07,354
Look, we both want the same
thing, right?

63
00:03:07,818 --> 00:03:09,253
To help our friends.

64
00:03:09,841 --> 00:03:11,692
All you have to do
is one little surgery,

65
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,966
free of charge.
Say, tomorrow morning?

66
00:03:15,861 --> 00:03:17,504
Otherwise,

67
00:03:17,682 --> 00:03:19,991
I will tell Sean everything,

68
00:03:20,155 --> 00:03:23,078
and then we'll see
what kind of pushover he really is.

<i>Chaz Darling</i>

72
00:05:17,247 --> 00:05:18,882
You say we cooked it all.

73
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:20,486
We did.

74
00:05:20,937 --> 00:05:22,988
I was trying to visualize
our next score.

75
00:05:24,786 --> 00:05:26,180
It's "The secret."

76
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:30,497
It's this book. I read it, like,
three times when you were out.

77
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:34,162
It's... it's... the universe works
through laws of attraction.

78
00:05:34,244 --> 00:05:35,669
When you put it out to the world,

79
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:38,422
something you want,
instead of focusing on what you don't,

80
00:05:38,524 --> 00:05:40,507
then it comes to you.
It's like a magnet.

81
00:05:40,838 --> 00:05:42,328
Do you want to try it?

82
00:05:51,443 --> 00:05:53,437
I told you. It works. It worked.

83
00:05:53,878 --> 00:05:57,569
Did you feel the universe
calling you like a magnet just now?

84
00:05:58,794 --> 00:06:01,028
Yeah, she means did you
bring the meth?

85
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,509
- The money first, remember?
- Right, um...

86
00:06:06,765 --> 00:06:09,362
- We don't have it.
- That sucks for you.

87
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,549
Wait, no! Wait a second.

88
00:06:14,503 --> 00:06:18,973
Maybe you and I could work out
some kind of payment plan.

89
00:06:19,342 --> 00:06:21,631
The world is infinitely abundant,

90
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:25,703
and maybe you could just
visualize something that you want?

91
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:28,221
Yeah, I know what I want.

92
00:06:29,828 --> 00:06:32,601
I want some of that back-door
action like I seen in your movies.

93
00:06:33,996 --> 00:06:36,074
You give me that,
I give you the whole rock.

94
00:06:36,293 --> 00:06:37,878
Ass for cash.

95
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,653
Well, do you want straight sex,
or do you want anal?

96
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,056
Here's your back door, asshole.

97
00:06:45,174 --> 00:06:46,877
You are not screwing him for money!

98
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,867
- Jesus, baby!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

99
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:51,953
Honey, we're so much more than that.

100
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:00,076
I'm sorry. I know.

101
00:07:06,143 --> 00:07:09,429
I think I know where we can get
some real cash.

102
00:07:10,908 --> 00:07:12,766
Do you realize what this is doing to us?

103
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:16,269
You've put Julia and in a
very uncomfortable position.

104
00:07:16,554 --> 00:07:18,438
Maybe you're just using the
wrong dildo, mom.

105
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:22,649
Besides, you're the one that taught me
to use my brain to get what I want.

106
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:26,279
blackmail is not using your brain, Eden.
It is a criminal act.

107
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,504
You say tomato.

108
00:07:27,586 --> 00:07:29,854
You're going to apologize tochristian,
and then you're gonna promise me

109
00:07:29,936 --> 00:07:31,952
you're never gonna make
a threat like that again.

110
00:07:33,157 --> 00:07:35,618
I'm 18. I make my own decisions.

111
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:38,792
There's nothing you can do about that.

112
00:07:40,196 --> 00:07:42,444
I don't know what else I can do.

113
00:07:42,512 --> 00:07:45,590
I mean, the more interfere,
the worse she seems to behave,

114
00:07:45,692 --> 00:07:48,593
or maybe we should just tell
sean ourselves.

115
00:07:49,225 --> 00:07:50,929
You know he's getting re-married.

116
00:07:51,031 --> 00:07:52,764
Doesn't care about me anymore.

117
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:55,809
This isn't about you, Julia.
This is about me and Sean.

118
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:58,153
Our friendship barely survived
the last time he found out.

119
00:07:58,235 --> 00:07:59,533
He'll never forgive me now.

120
00:07:59,656 --> 00:08:02,007
If you tell Sean,
I'll never forgive you.

121
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,875
Fine, I won't say a word...

122
00:08:08,632 --> 00:08:10,699
If you dump the witch of eastwick.

123
00:08:12,003 --> 00:08:13,315
Is that what this is about?

124
00:08:13,684 --> 00:08:15,857
It's either you or Julia?

125
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:18,540
She's not even gay, mom.

126
00:08:18,642 --> 00:08:21,720
How can you stand to be with
someone who's living a lie?

127
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:28,967
Nice try, guys. Didn't work.

128
00:08:33,363 --> 00:08:36,516
Come on, all this estrogen,
you can't control one little teenager?

129
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,322
I just don't know where
I went wrong with her,

130
00:08:39,431 --> 00:08:41,816
where all this venom came from.

131
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,191
Sean's the innocent in all this.

132
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:16,932
What's she look like?

133
00:09:17,747 --> 00:09:18,593
What?

134
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:20,131
The woman you were fantasizing about,

135
00:09:20,187 --> 00:09:21,615
because you definitely
weren't with me just then.

136
00:09:21,672 --> 00:09:22,412
Of course I was.

137
00:09:22,512 --> 00:09:24,002
If you're going to fantasize
about somebody else,

138
00:09:24,058 --> 00:09:25,815
at least have the balls to admit it.
I'm not stupid.

139
00:09:26,724 --> 00:09:28,152
Kate, what the...

140
00:09:33,963 --> 00:09:36,722
I'm sorry. You were amazing. I just...

141
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:40,370
had this image in my head.

142
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:46,169
My wife and I were married almost
20 years. The last 10 years, the sex...

143
00:09:46,271 --> 00:09:48,255
You know what? I'm not Julia, OK?

144
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:50,590
I'm not interested in
having mutual masturbation

145
00:09:50,692 --> 00:09:52,473
sessions for the rest of our lives.

146
00:09:57,459 --> 00:10:01,195
You know what dooms relationships?
It is not money. It is not sex.

147
00:10:01,283 --> 00:10:03,776
It is secrets, and you of all
people should know that.

148
00:10:05,874 --> 00:10:07,528
Look, if I'm gonna marry you,

149
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,021
I want to know everything
that turns you on.

150
00:10:12,436 --> 00:10:15,992
It's that honesty that's gonna keep us
together. It's not gonna pull us apart.

151
00:10:27,462 --> 00:10:29,671
I was thinking about a schoolgirl.

152
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,037
She's wearing this little uniform,

153
00:10:33,695 --> 00:10:34,871
no panties,

154
00:10:35,977 --> 00:10:39,681
and she's such a bad little whore,
she needs a spanking.

155
00:10:43,521 --> 00:10:46,181
- Is it too much?
- No! No, no, no, it's...

156
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:50,592
- Well, you said...
- No, it's good. I know, I know.

157
00:10:50,676 --> 00:10:52,769
It's good.
I... I feel closer, don't you?

158
00:10:52,825 --> 00:10:54,613
- I do, OK.
- Definitely.

159
00:10:58,397 --> 00:11:00,978
You know, I've got, like,
a 3:00 am call, so I'm gonna...

160
00:11:01,062 --> 00:11:02,406
I'm gonna go to sleep, OK?

161
00:11:03,106 --> 00:11:04,800
- Oh, yeah. Me, too.
- Now.

162
00:11:20,782 --> 00:11:21,973
Hi, daddy.

163
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,726
What are you doing here?

164
00:11:25,115 --> 00:11:27,270
Just watching your friend, my doctor.

165
00:11:48,553 --> 00:11:49,876
What the hell is wrong with you?

166
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,046
You know how I feel about her,
and you still went behind my back?

167
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,090
I'm assuming you're talking about Eden.

168
00:11:55,192 --> 00:11:56,591
Who the hell else
would I be talking about?

169
00:11:56,771 --> 00:11:58,301
And don't tell me you slept with her,

170
00:11:58,403 --> 00:12:00,845
because that would end this
partnership right here, right now.

171
00:12:00,947 --> 00:12:02,111
What exactly did she tell you?

172
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,254
That you agreed to fix
her friend for free?

173
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,728
Chaz is a stylist to the stars, OK?

174
00:12:06,798 --> 00:12:09,527
He's got a huge client list, and he's
gonna send referrals our way, all right?

175
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:11,442
Look, you've got this great
gig with the tv show.

176
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:13,441
I'm just trying to do the most
with my opportunities.

177
00:12:13,543 --> 00:12:14,343
OK?

178
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,059
Is that why you're really angry?

179
00:12:18,126 --> 00:12:20,067
I mean, you're acting like a
jealous boyfriend right now.

180
00:12:20,137 --> 00:12:21,327
If I'm surfing your turf...

181
00:12:21,392 --> 00:12:22,806
Don't be ridiculous,

182
00:12:22,904 --> 00:12:24,786
and don't ever lie
to me like that again.

183
00:12:36,904 --> 00:12:39,223
Best girl-on-girl of 2005,
"Lady and the tramps."

184
00:12:39,336 --> 00:12:40,698
Weren't you up for that one?

185
00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:42,078
God, those were the days.

186
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,417
Somebody in this room call
for a plumber?

187
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,010
Why, yes, I did.

188
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,556
Are you here to fix my pipes?

189
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:57,184
I don't know. I might have to just probe
around a little bit first, miss.

190
00:12:58,761 --> 00:13:00,226
See what I can find.

191
00:13:03,488 --> 00:13:05,356
- Probe away.
- My pleasure.

192
00:13:09,207 --> 00:13:11,460
- Remember that shoot?
- Yes, I remember that shoot.

193
00:13:11,723 --> 00:13:14,343
"Plumbers and dykes", still our number
one seller of all time.

194
00:13:14,449 --> 00:13:16,346
- Is it really?
- Yes, it is. Hand to god.

195
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:17,792
Doesn't surprise me.

196
00:13:18,043 --> 00:13:20,721
- Ram, this is my husband Matt.
- Yeah, hi. And her manager.

197
00:13:20,872 --> 00:13:22,010
Hey, nice to meet you.

198
00:13:22,255 --> 00:13:24,411
Yeah, nice to meet you, too.
Here, why don't you sit down?

199
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:26,967
- Take a load off. Who's that?
- This is jenna.

200
00:13:28,425 --> 00:13:30,277
I was really happy
when you called me, Kimmy.

201
00:13:30,386 --> 00:13:32,799
So how you been? Where you been?
What's -- What's been going on?

202
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:34,956
What is the matter with her?
Why is she doing this?

203
00:13:35,087 --> 00:13:36,768
I think she might need a new diaper.

204
00:13:36,887 --> 00:13:38,732
- I don't have a diaper.
- We don't have any.

205
00:13:39,962 --> 00:13:40,844
Let me help.

206
00:13:41,107 --> 00:13:42,200
Hey, baby!

207
00:13:42,432 --> 00:13:44,310
Come on in here.
I've got a live one for you.

208
00:13:44,913 --> 00:13:46,340
My wife runs a daycare center.

209
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:47,936
You have a daycare center here?

210
00:13:48,049 --> 00:13:49,964
We're very, very family-friendly
these days.

211
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:53,523
Busty, my old friend Kimmy

212
00:13:53,804 --> 00:13:54,987
and her husband Matt.

213
00:13:55,573 --> 00:13:56,605
My god!

214
00:13:57,364 --> 00:13:58,591
Kimber Henry!

215
00:14:00,168 --> 00:14:02,203
You are, like, an idol of mine.

216
00:14:02,685 --> 00:14:04,262
I think the little girl needs
a diaper change.

217
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:06,433
You mind seeing if you could handle
that while we talk shop?

218
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,095
Sweetie. Ok, ok.

219
00:14:15,795 --> 00:14:17,054
So where were we, huh?

220
00:14:18,448 --> 00:14:20,861
How would you like to double
your sales this quarter?

221
00:14:21,383 --> 00:14:22,904
I want back in the business.

222
00:14:23,694 --> 00:14:26,361
You know, just a few choice titles,
nothing too raunchy,

223
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,896
Provided there's an advance involved.

224
00:14:30,702 --> 00:14:32,792
That's a very tempting offer, really.

225
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:34,817
It really is,

226
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:38,449
but I don't think you're ready.

227
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,286
Are you kidding?

228
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,022
Ram, I could saddle up this afternoon.

229
00:14:43,646 --> 00:14:45,242
You need to kick the meth, hon.

230
00:14:45,762 --> 00:14:48,181
I can see the signs,
the weight loss, the bad skin.

231
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:49,826
All that stuff shows up on camera.

232
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:51,798
It's very, very bad
for my company's image.

233
00:14:54,472 --> 00:14:57,015
Last time I saw this young lady,
she was on top of the world.

234
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,724
What the hell happened to her?

235
00:15:02,575 --> 00:15:04,855
I got mixed up in a church, Ram,

236
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:08,003
and they took all of our money,

237
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:09,704
and I'm not proud of it.

238
00:15:11,426 --> 00:15:13,703
You know I've always been
that kind of person

239
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:17,306
who was on a search for something
that makes me feel special

240
00:15:17,907 --> 00:15:19,081
and complete.

241
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:23,765
The church didn't make
those feelings go away,

242
00:15:25,802 --> 00:15:28,966
and then I got pregnant,
and I got so fat.

243
00:15:31,314 --> 00:15:33,015
So a friend of mine said,

244
00:15:34,038 --> 00:15:37,004
"Kimber, do meth for a couple weeks."

245
00:15:37,196 --> 00:15:39,384
"I lost 20 pounds," so I did,

246
00:15:40,492 --> 00:15:41,948
and I lost the weight,

247
00:15:42,945 --> 00:15:45,774
but when it was time to quit,

248
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,933
I didn't want to.

249
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,679
I finally found something

250
00:15:55,308 --> 00:15:56,801
to take the pain away.

251
00:15:59,148 --> 00:15:59,963
Look, man,

252
00:16:01,186 --> 00:16:02,966
we just really need
a break right now, ok?

253
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:05,538
I mean, can you help a friend out?

254
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,523
Kimmy, I'll tell you what.

255
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:14,269
What do you say we give
your hubby there a shot?

256
00:16:15,255 --> 00:16:18,204
I saw the pregnancy video you guys
did online. It was very, very good.

257
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,444
You got talent, and besides,
you're packing a firehose down

258
00:16:21,568 --> 00:16:22,752
There, and that's marketable.

259
00:16:22,874 --> 00:16:25,400
Matt making adult films makes
absolutely no sense.

260
00:16:25,757 --> 00:16:27,886
You know that.
There's no money in it for men.

261
00:16:28,006 --> 00:16:29,647
Only women make money.

262
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:31,065
Tell you what.

263
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,082
You are talking about straight porn.

264
00:16:37,573 --> 00:16:39,789
"First time fairies" is a very,
very hot title for us.

265
00:16:39,928 --> 00:16:42,623
We just lost one of our leads,
got sidelined with syphilis.

266
00:16:42,867 --> 00:16:45,203
You'd be on the bottom,
and that twink chic look works very,

267
00:16:45,306 --> 00:16:47,010
Very well for this genre.

268
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:51,136
Shoots tomorrow,
pays five grand, you interested?

269
00:17:00,205 --> 00:17:03,351
Mr. Forrest, tell us
what you don't like about yourself.

270
00:17:03,714 --> 00:17:05,486
I really don't do the self-hate thing.

271
00:17:06,022 --> 00:17:07,946
You know, my calves too small,
my nose too big?

272
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,365
No, it's not my nature.

273
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:12,021
I have legitimate medical issues.

274
00:17:12,277 --> 00:17:13,384
That's why I'm here.

275
00:17:14,082 --> 00:17:15,847
Probably better
if I just show you, right?

276
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:21,909
What did that? A tiger?

277
00:17:23,372 --> 00:17:25,917
Mrs. Decker's certainly a wild animal
in the sack.

278
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:28,188
I'm guessing Mr. Decker doesn't know
what Mrs. Decker's

279
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:29,832
Been doing with her fingernails lately.

280
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:32,430
Chuck was there when it happened.
He watched the whole thing.

281
00:17:36,198 --> 00:17:37,449
Swingers' party.

282
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,560
And I have a party coming up next week.

283
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,922
I was hoping I'd be mostly back
to form by then.

284
00:17:44,198 --> 00:17:45,560
So this is a weekly thing then?

285
00:17:45,992 --> 00:17:48,112
About two, three times a month, yeah.

286
00:17:48,832 --> 00:17:50,146
I'm sort of like the host.

287
00:17:50,388 --> 00:17:52,595
How long have you and your wife
been involved with the lifestyle?

288
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,357
No, no. I'm not married.

289
00:17:55,596 --> 00:17:59,465
Well, from my experience
swingers' clubs are couples only.

290
00:17:59,694 --> 00:18:01,159
Well, ours is a little different.

291
00:18:01,574 --> 00:18:04,144
We mix couples, singles,

292
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:07,209
mostly white, middle-aged moms
and their husbands

293
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:11,386
with other young,
successful black men, like myself.

294
00:18:13,263 --> 00:18:15,765
So these couples come just
so you and your friends can --

295
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:16,948
Be exploited?

296
00:18:17,884 --> 00:18:21,781
Balding white males paying young black
studs to bang their wives.

297
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,961
Doesn't that sound
like exploitation to you?

298
00:18:24,452 --> 00:18:26,444
Nobody said anything
about getting paid.

299
00:18:26,763 --> 00:18:28,987
I mean, we all pay dues
to belong to the club,

300
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:31,577
white and black.

301
00:18:31,824 --> 00:18:32,981
I don't get it.

302
00:18:33,511 --> 00:18:36,510
You're young, successful.
You could have any woman you want.

303
00:18:38,342 --> 00:18:39,525
I'm a lawyer.

304
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:43,028
Most women I meet in this town,
all they see is a wallet.

305
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:45,312
Then you try to have sex
with them, and...

306
00:18:47,953 --> 00:18:49,204
You get a hold of those

307
00:18:49,937 --> 00:18:52,284
40-year-old soccer moms, though.

308
00:18:55,423 --> 00:18:58,184
'Cause they've got that baby weight
on them from having three kids.

309
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,486
Best part is, when it's all over,

310
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:03,954
she and her husband can't
thank you enough.

311
00:19:05,329 --> 00:19:06,496
Then I think about it.

312
00:19:07,327 --> 00:19:10,682
You love your lady. You want to see her
happy, and I just gave her five orgasms.

313
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,742
Doesn't everybody win?

314
00:19:23,722 --> 00:19:25,773
Yeah, she must be going
through a growth spurt.

315
00:19:25,885 --> 00:19:28,274
She's getting so irritable.
What are you doing?

316
00:19:29,216 --> 00:19:31,090
I found loose change.
Will you help me?

317
00:19:32,322 --> 00:19:33,204
When I walk,

318
00:19:33,624 --> 00:19:36,131
I can feel it. There's like three
or four quarters right under here.

319
00:19:36,238 --> 00:19:37,426
It's, like, right here.

320
00:19:37,538 --> 00:19:38,453
Help me.

321
00:19:38,865 --> 00:19:40,771
I'm -- I'm gonna feed Jenna first.

322
00:19:45,454 --> 00:19:47,313
Where's the Baby Formula, Kimber?

323
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:51,843
Did I not ask you to go to the store?

324
00:19:53,284 --> 00:19:55,866
What -- What did you do
with the cash that I gave you?

325
00:19:56,873 --> 00:19:59,329
Hey, here. No, let me see your eyes.

326
00:20:01,006 --> 00:20:02,584
Great. You smoked it.

327
00:20:02,872 --> 00:20:03,888
You smoked it.

328
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,568
I'm sorry. I-- I needed a little bit
to get me through.

329
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:10,422
I'd have saved it for you,
but the shit burns fast.

330
00:20:12,123 --> 00:20:13,870
Damn it, Matt!
Don't make me feel bad!

331
00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:15,978
Just help me!
Help me pull up the carpet.

332
00:20:16,122 --> 00:20:17,706
There's money under here.

333
00:20:17,813 --> 00:20:18,813
Please.

334
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,561
Come on!

335
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:26,426
Why are you sitting there? Help me!

336
00:20:26,688 --> 00:20:27,928
There's money here!

337
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,098
God.

338
00:20:34,354 --> 00:20:36,823
<i>If you had a job, then we'd have money,
wouldn't we?</i>

339
00:20:37,065 --> 00:20:38,432
<i>Stupid change!</i>

340
00:20:44,061 --> 00:20:45,369
Hey, where you going?

341
00:20:46,001 --> 00:20:48,739
Ram said they have a daycare.
They can watch Jenna while I work.

342
00:21:00,195 --> 00:21:01,806
Kate's not here, mr. Mcnamara.

343
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,734
Look. I'm the only girl
in detention today.

344
00:21:13,032 --> 00:21:13,867
I see.

345
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:18,353
You must've been a very bad girl
to have to stay after school.

346
00:21:18,562 --> 00:21:19,782
I was, mr. Mcnamara.

347
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:21,972
I was very bad.

348
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,376
And...

349
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,663
what is it you did?

350
00:21:26,517 --> 00:21:28,132
I forgot to wear panties.

351
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,785
Are you gonna spank me now?

352
00:21:56,092 --> 00:21:58,433
You've got a really great ass.

353
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,724
It's too bad I can't see more of it
when we're having sex,

354
00:22:01,864 --> 00:22:03,912
but I guess that would be
mechanically impossible?

355
00:22:04,028 --> 00:22:05,044
Oh, I don't know.

356
00:22:05,351 --> 00:22:07,780
A few more twists
on those positions we did earlier,

357
00:22:07,964 --> 00:22:10,210
it might be possible.

358
00:22:11,108 --> 00:22:14,127
God, that was the most fun
I've had in years.

359
00:22:16,488 --> 00:22:18,388
I'm a little surprised though.

360
00:22:18,974 --> 00:22:21,939
I thought hearing that fantasy
the other day turned you off?

361
00:22:22,284 --> 00:22:24,797
Well, hmm, I was
a little intimidated. Then,

362
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:27,418
I thought, Kate, you brought it up,

363
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:30,517
so put your money
where your mouth is, right?

364
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:33,989
I mean, it's not like you wanted
to have sex with an

365
00:22:34,418 --> 00:22:37,141
- albino amputee or anything, right?
- well,

366
00:22:37,305 --> 00:22:41,324
what if I did want to have sex with an
albino amputee? Then what would you do?

367
00:22:41,601 --> 00:22:44,115
Whatever I could to make you happy,

368
00:22:44,513 --> 00:22:46,091
because I love you.

369
00:22:49,554 --> 00:22:51,637
Want to hear something really wild?

370
00:22:52,189 --> 00:22:53,246
This guy

371
00:22:54,428 --> 00:22:55,945
came into the office,

372
00:22:56,323 --> 00:22:59,465
a very good-looking guy,
thirties, African-American.

373
00:22:59,664 --> 00:23:02,545
He, uh, need to get these scratches
on his back fixed.

374
00:23:02,776 --> 00:23:05,879
Turns out he throws interracial parties.

375
00:23:06,117 --> 00:23:08,416
This is where white couples go

376
00:23:08,622 --> 00:23:12,760
so the wives can have sex with young
black men while the husbands watch.

377
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:16,097
- That's insane, right?
- Yeah.

378
00:23:16,273 --> 00:23:19,131
I mean, can you imagine
anybody wanting to do that?

379
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,101
- You can?
- Well,

380
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,181
I don't know. Watching you
watch me get off?

381
00:23:27,702 --> 00:23:30,078
That's kind of hot, don't you think?

382
00:23:30,533 --> 00:23:32,471
- Yeah.
- Wait, wait. Hey, Sean.

383
00:23:33,693 --> 00:23:36,743
I thought we were gonna be honest with
each other about this kind of stuff?

384
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:38,058
- Yeah.
- Well, I mean,

385
00:23:38,212 --> 00:23:40,678
I can't help it if my fantasy
happens to have a

386
00:23:40,908 --> 00:23:43,192
handsome black guy in it.

387
00:23:43,736 --> 00:23:45,598
Makes me hot. What can I say?

388
00:23:48,111 --> 00:23:50,211
These burgers are so good.

389
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:55,162
Really, they're amazing.

390
00:23:56,878 --> 00:23:58,380
OK, are your eyes closed?

391
00:23:58,534 --> 00:24:00,633
Yes, and the suspense is killing me.

392
00:24:00,996 --> 00:24:04,061
OK, imagine you're
the doorman at Teddy's,

393
00:24:04,598 --> 00:24:06,084
and this walks up.

394
00:24:19,165 --> 00:24:22,276
I hope you didn't valet already.
What size is that again?

395
00:24:22,996 --> 00:24:24,429
it's a zero. You picked it out.

396
00:24:24,591 --> 00:24:27,354
Yeah, see, the new size to be seen in

397
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:28,569
is a negative two.

398
00:24:29,183 --> 00:24:31,110
You're busting out
at the seams, sweetie.

399
00:24:32,944 --> 00:24:36,198
Sorry, am interrupting
"Extreme Makeover: horror edition"?

400
00:24:36,818 --> 00:24:38,971
OK, let's see what you got.

401
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,010
Sutures look good.

402
00:24:42,301 --> 00:24:43,819
No sign of infection.

403
00:24:44,646 --> 00:24:46,133
I think we're all good.

404
00:24:46,978 --> 00:24:49,637
OK, so, we made a deal.

405
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:53,798
- You can leave now.
- You're right, we made a deal.

406
00:24:54,541 --> 00:24:57,012
You do one surgery,
and I keep my mouth shut,

407
00:24:57,441 --> 00:24:59,465
but that's not the surgery
I had in mind.

408
00:25:00,075 --> 00:25:02,225
Lunchtime lipo is a
fairly easy procedure.

409
00:25:02,341 --> 00:25:04,296
I need a little done around the waist.

410
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,980
It's the only way, sweetie.

411
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:10,043
You're joking, right?

412
00:25:10,266 --> 00:25:12,774
Yeah, you want to see the punchline?

413
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,310
Truth be told,
when I overheard the skank

414
00:25:15,425 --> 00:25:17,428
tell my mom about your
little one-night stand,

415
00:25:17,628 --> 00:25:20,989
it wasn't so much me eavesdropping
as it was checking the tape

416
00:25:21,116 --> 00:25:23,347
and the camera I hid in their bedroom

417
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,449
What is this?

418
00:25:28,334 --> 00:25:30,912
A download I know
you're just dying to see.

419
00:25:40,153 --> 00:25:41,840
The whole video's
about 20 minutes long,

420
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,900
but I think i'll only post
the last five.

421
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:46,488
It's the part where mom
gets Julia to come

422
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,493
Here it is. Watch.

423
00:25:54,663 --> 00:25:56,855
<i>Well, better than Christian?</i>

424
00:25:58,709 --> 00:26:00,426
<i>Much better, honey.</i>

425
00:26:04,834 --> 00:26:06,494
The new deal is lipo,

426
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:09,025
or this gets posted on the web
where Sean can see it,

427
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,847
Annie can see it, and your
pasty little Julia can --

428
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:13,477
You stupid little shit!

429
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,375
I bruise easy, doctor,

430
00:26:15,698 --> 00:26:19,420
so take a deep breath and think
about what your options here really are.

431
00:26:39,969 --> 00:26:42,497
A local anesthetic in your back
will numb the pain,

432
00:26:42,697 --> 00:26:44,406
but if you feel discomfort,

433
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,656
Liz can always give you
a bullet to bite down on.

434
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:49,194
Or use my mallet
and knock you unconscious.

435
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,891
Whatever floats your boat.

436
00:26:56,546 --> 00:26:57,895
Fingernail tip.

437
00:26:58,365 --> 00:26:59,921
It still has some polish on it!

438
00:27:00,557 --> 00:27:02,689
We'll have to pass
a new rule for the club.

439
00:27:02,805 --> 00:27:05,170
No press-on nails at parties.

440
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:06,709
It's too dangerous.

441
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,673
You might want to get
a blood panel, too.

442
00:27:08,811 --> 00:27:09,920
I've already done that.

443
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,891
Every member of the club
has to submit an STD test.

444
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,879
- You make it sound so--
- Insane?

445
00:27:18,486 --> 00:27:21,497
- Sorry about that.
- It's OK. I'm not ashamed of it.

446
00:27:23,515 --> 00:27:27,114
How did you get involved with this world
to begin with, if I can ask?

447
00:27:27,487 --> 00:27:28,920
Well, I was at a bar

448
00:27:29,411 --> 00:27:31,757
and got picked up by this hot,
older woman,

449
00:27:32,136 --> 00:27:35,859
and we get to her house,
she introduces me to her husband.

450
00:27:36,464 --> 00:27:39,226
A little weird at first,
but we go there.

451
00:27:39,487 --> 00:27:41,592
Then one day, she asked me
if I had any friends

452
00:27:41,848 --> 00:27:44,747
who'd be interested,
and things took off from there.

453
00:27:45,644 --> 00:27:47,036
The other couples that--

454
00:27:49,331 --> 00:27:50,157
Yeah?

455
00:27:53,782 --> 00:27:55,598
The other couples who show up now,

456
00:27:56,627 --> 00:28:00,398
say someone didn't want to actually
have relations with someone.

457
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:03,504
You mean, if they could just watch?

458
00:28:04,014 --> 00:28:06,145
Like, out of curiosity, yeah.

459
00:28:06,363 --> 00:28:07,658
Well, we get that all the time.

460
00:28:07,774 --> 00:28:11,100
All newcomers just want to check out
the scene before they commit anyhow.

461
00:28:11,238 --> 00:28:14,895
Mostly, they're looking
to recharge their sex life.

462
00:28:15,424 --> 00:28:16,758
Recharge, huh?

463
00:28:18,009 --> 00:28:19,619
How long have you been with your woman?

464
00:28:19,754 --> 00:28:21,699
How's the pain level, Mr. Forrest?

465
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,113
Um, fine, thanks.

466
00:28:23,314 --> 00:28:26,501
The pain level's great. We're good, Liz.

467
00:28:35,024 --> 00:28:36,724
Hey, Matt, everything
come out all right?

468
00:28:36,858 --> 00:28:40,078
Yeah, I guess. I have never done
one of those enema things before.

469
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:42,511
They're a pain in the ass, but you get
used to them. Let me show you the set.

470
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:44,746
Get a chance to look at the script?
You know the set-up, right?

471
00:28:44,869 --> 00:28:48,938
Yeah. My name's Ricki Boi.
I'm here for stealing a car, and,

472
00:28:49,322 --> 00:28:50,948
there's a strip search involved.

473
00:28:51,095 --> 00:28:52,320
Johnny!

474
00:28:52,902 --> 00:28:55,768
you should meet your co-star,
great guy, very professional.

475
00:28:56,243 --> 00:28:59,462
Uh, hey. I'm, uh, Matt.
Nice to meet you.

476
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,053
Am I gonna break this guy or what?

477
00:29:02,191 --> 00:29:04,049
I'm a little worried about this.

478
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:06,267
Matt! Get over here.

479
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:09,094
What are you doing here? I told you
Jenna's with Busty. She's fine.

480
00:29:09,344 --> 00:29:12,971
- Ram, I need a minute with him.
Yeah, hang on. Look,

481
00:29:13,071 --> 00:29:15,598
you got 10 minutes. I booked
a foot-fetish shoot on this stage

482
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:19,025
from 3:00 to 6:00,
All right? 10 minutes.

483
00:29:19,377 --> 00:29:23,080
Remember, we've got to swap these sets
out as soon as little Mattie's done.

484
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,192
Get dressed now.

485
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:27,182
I am not letting you do this.

486
00:29:27,431 --> 00:29:29,016
Oh, so it's OK for you, but not for me?

487
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,355
I was a queen in this business.

488
00:29:31,459 --> 00:29:33,818
I made seven figures a year.
What are you making?

489
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:36,639
Five grand to be a sloppy bottom?

490
00:29:36,977 --> 00:29:38,339
There's nothing worse than that.

491
00:29:38,471 --> 00:29:40,383
No, I'll tell you what's worse.
No money

492
00:29:40,517 --> 00:29:44,496
and a rent that is way past due. What
other choice do we have at this point?

493
00:29:45,151 --> 00:29:46,668
I called the church.

494
00:29:47,374 --> 00:29:49,887
Now, they have offered
to take care of us again,

495
00:29:50,025 --> 00:29:54,715
and if we agree to a purification
rundown and go to narcon,

496
00:29:54,898 --> 00:29:56,783
they're willing to reinstate us.

497
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:01,224
Now, I told them we'd swing
by first thing in the morning.

498
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:11,458
I just want to be a good father and
a good husband, Kimber. That's all.

499
00:30:13,386 --> 00:30:16,528
But you are, you are. Come here.

500
00:30:16,685 --> 00:30:17,945
God.

501
00:30:19,876 --> 00:30:23,723
Come on, can we get out of here?
This place is disgusting.

502
00:30:33,478 --> 00:30:38,334
You need to peel this like prosciutto.
Take an inch off each side,

503
00:30:38,783 --> 00:30:40,990
and then, then you'll be runway ready.

504
00:30:41,327 --> 00:30:42,977
What do you think about my boobs?

505
00:30:43,077 --> 00:30:45,418
I was thinking about
going up a cup size, like,

506
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:48,759
You know, just to make myself better,
like all the other girls.

507
00:30:49,239 --> 00:30:50,771
Fake tits are so '97.

508
00:30:51,033 --> 00:30:53,576
All guys want are abs and hips.

509
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:56,456
A sense of humor and good
family genes don't hurt, either,

510
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,255
but I can't help you there.

511
00:30:58,382 --> 00:31:00,590
I need a moment
with my patient, hubcap nip.

512
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:10,747
Shouldn't you be in scrubs? We have to
get this done before Sean gets here.

513
00:31:10,926 --> 00:31:12,781
We'll be done long before that.

514
00:31:15,141 --> 00:31:17,307
- What's this?
- Phentermine. Heard of it?

515
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,279
The prescription diet pill?

516
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,263
Any tweenie with an internet connection
and their mother's credit card

517
00:31:22,363 --> 00:31:23,596
can get a month's supply from Canada.

518
00:31:23,709 --> 00:31:26,710
Not this kind.
It's compounded with zonegran.

519
00:31:26,938 --> 00:31:29,394
Much more effective
and completely unavailable

520
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:30,979
without a doctor's prescription.

521
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,706
It'll make you lose weight faster,
feel better,

522
00:31:33,841 --> 00:31:35,392
and it's got a hip factor of ten.

523
00:31:37,612 --> 00:31:41,196
- Are you trying to buy me off, doctor?
- No, this is trying to buy you off.

524
00:31:41,383 --> 00:31:44,126
Xanax for the anxiety
that you clearly have

525
00:31:44,524 --> 00:31:48,008
and percoset to bring you down after
a good night's clubbing, all right?

526
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:50,971
Each with one free refill.

527
00:31:52,595 --> 00:31:55,491
You don't need lipo, all right?
The ounces you want to lose?

528
00:31:55,688 --> 00:31:58,051
These pills are going to do the job, OK?

529
00:31:58,218 --> 00:32:00,311
Quite frankly, Sean is getting
a little suspicious,

530
00:32:00,415 --> 00:32:02,139
so we're going to have to compromise.

531
00:32:03,717 --> 00:32:05,026
Two free refills.

532
00:32:08,637 --> 00:32:11,064
And I never see you
around this office again?

533
00:32:13,274 --> 00:32:16,384
My own Dr. Feelgood. I like it.

534
00:32:30,437 --> 00:32:31,720
You sure you want to do this?

535
00:32:31,894 --> 00:32:35,158
We're only here to watch anyway, right?

536
00:32:35,812 --> 00:32:38,542
OK, you really think no one's going
to recognize me from the show?

537
00:32:38,642 --> 00:32:39,684
'Cause I'll put this on.

538
00:32:39,784 --> 00:32:43,272
I was told there's a code of silence
at these things.

539
00:32:43,415 --> 00:32:45,384
- Yeah.
- I think it's OK.

540
00:32:51,493 --> 00:32:54,436
Let's do this. Let's go.

541
00:33:08,963 --> 00:33:09,948
Hey, you know what?

542
00:33:10,052 --> 00:33:11,778
- We should have a safe word.
- A what?

543
00:33:11,917 --> 00:33:14,768
You know, a word in case one of us
gets uncomfortable and wants to go.

544
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,748
We'll say something, like, big wheel.

545
00:33:16,978 --> 00:33:19,001
That's a word that a
dominatrix would use,

546
00:33:19,103 --> 00:33:20,959
with their clients so nobody gets hurt.

547
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:23,443
- How do you know that?
- Is "big wheel" OK with you?

548
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,901
- Sure.
- OK.

549
00:33:26,449 --> 00:33:28,635
I'm really excited. Aren't you?

550
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:31,395
- Oh, definitely.
- OK, um,

551
00:33:33,085 --> 00:33:34,391
let's -- OK.

552
00:33:38,774 --> 00:33:41,413
Oh, Dr. Mcnamara. I'm glad you came.

553
00:33:41,842 --> 00:33:44,547
- Is this the lovely fiance?
- Hi, I'm Kate. Nice to meet you.

554
00:33:44,709 --> 00:33:46,940
Well, come on in.
We're just getting started.

555
00:33:51,303 --> 00:33:52,628
Don't be shy.

556
00:33:53,234 --> 00:33:54,664
No one else here is.

557
00:34:16,697 --> 00:34:18,490
Oh, the house rules.

558
00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:21,372
First, no cell phones
and no cameras of any kind.

559
00:34:21,472 --> 00:34:23,678
This is a private club.
We'd like to keep it that way.

560
00:34:23,782 --> 00:34:27,488
Second, women make the invitations,
and women can say "no" at any time.

561
00:34:27,636 --> 00:34:30,606
Third, clean up after yourself.
I'm the host, not the maid.

562
00:34:30,895 --> 00:34:33,010
Finally, most important,

563
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:34,781
have fun!

564
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:39,267
You want to explore?

565
00:34:39,698 --> 00:34:42,281
- I'm going to get us some drinks first.
- OK.

566
00:35:13,846 --> 00:35:14,987
You like that?

567
00:35:16,189 --> 00:35:17,299
She yours?

568
00:35:18,422 --> 00:35:19,642
No, mine's, uh...

569
00:35:35,561 --> 00:35:38,444
Come on, Lois.
Show him what you're working with.

570
00:35:41,155 --> 00:35:43,024
Let's go find a safer place
to sit down.

571
00:36:23,635 --> 00:36:26,146
You guys mind if we use the bed?
Everywhere else is full.

572
00:36:26,826 --> 00:36:28,145
No, go ahead, go ahead.

573
00:36:29,032 --> 00:36:29,962
Thank you.

574
00:36:34,149 --> 00:36:35,464
Come on, big boy.

575
00:36:36,592 --> 00:36:38,451
You guys are welcome
to stay if you like.

576
00:36:40,571 --> 00:36:42,733
Come on. I'm ready for you.

577
00:36:42,865 --> 00:36:44,733
This is what we came to see, right?

578
00:36:47,795 --> 00:36:49,814
You want to go next?
She'll be done in a minute.

579
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:02,477
Big wheel.

580
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,123
Yeah, baby. Go for it.

581
00:37:05,335 --> 00:37:06,427
That's good.

582
00:37:09,976 --> 00:37:10,981
Big wheel.

583
00:37:11,308 --> 00:37:12,493
I think i'm gonna...

584
00:37:16,424 --> 00:37:17,382
Big wheel!

585
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,616
You hesitated.

586
00:37:36,562 --> 00:37:38,890
He asked you if you wanted to go next,
and you hesitated.

587
00:37:40,118 --> 00:37:42,468
That's why you wouldn't say
anything the whole way home?

588
00:37:44,241 --> 00:37:45,680
You're really reading into this.

589
00:37:45,821 --> 00:37:47,989
You didn't think what was going on
in there was sick?

590
00:37:48,755 --> 00:37:51,619
No. Consenting adults having fun? No.

591
00:37:53,242 --> 00:37:54,688
What is wrong with you?

592
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:58,405
Ok, I see. So wanting to have sex
with the schoolgirl is normal to you?

593
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,181
All you had to do is put on a dress.

594
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,325
But it was still your fantasy, Sean,

595
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:05,456
- and I followed through, no judgment.
- I never should have told you.

596
00:38:05,806 --> 00:38:07,396
You certainly liked the result,

597
00:38:07,565 --> 00:38:09,456
and don't criticize me
for having my fantasy, Sean.

598
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,395
We said no more secrets.
Do you rember that?

599
00:38:11,507 --> 00:38:14,465
No, you said that. I think it's better
to keep some things to ourselves.

600
00:38:15,161 --> 00:38:16,165
Why?

601
00:38:16,554 --> 00:38:18,799
Is there something else
you're keeping from me?

602
00:38:20,556 --> 00:38:21,761
Go on. Say it.

603
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:25,003
Really. What do you have to lose?
You already think i'm a whore now.

604
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,700
All right, you want the whole truth?

605
00:38:26,868 --> 00:38:28,575
I only liked the idea of going
there because i hoped it

606
00:38:28,697 --> 00:38:29,861
might spice up our sex life.

607
00:38:30,116 --> 00:38:31,863
I never thought you were
very good in bed.

608
00:38:31,983 --> 00:38:33,936
That's because i never got over you
shitting in the hot tub.

609
00:38:34,058 --> 00:38:35,144
I still think about it.

610
00:38:35,257 --> 00:38:37,736
That's why i have to fantasize
every time we have sex.

611
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:40,281
I think your ass is flat.

612
00:38:40,431 --> 00:38:41,746
I think you're going to get fat again.

613
00:38:41,868 --> 00:38:43,939
I think your ex-wife became a lesbian
because you made her

614
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,958
feel so horrible
that she hates men now.

615
00:38:46,089 --> 00:38:48,139
I only asked you to marry me
because I was scared,

616
00:38:48,252 --> 00:38:49,660
not Because i really loved you.

617
00:38:53,475 --> 00:38:55,710
- I'm sorry.
- Don't, don't, don't touch me.

618
00:39:08,649 --> 00:39:11,656
Say surprise to daddy.

619
00:39:12,904 --> 00:39:15,056
- You did all this while I was gone?
- We both did.

620
00:39:16,866 --> 00:39:18,490
I wanted a clean start.

621
00:39:19,404 --> 00:39:21,075
Go look at the kitchen.

622
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,315
I found $100 under the carpet,

623
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:31,100
and then I went into the garbage.
I pulled out some bottles,

624
00:39:31,372 --> 00:39:33,407
<i>-  and voilà.
- Baby Formula.</i>

625
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:39,644
Do you know how amazing you are?

626
00:39:39,754 --> 00:39:41,209
But it's like I told you.

627
00:39:41,322 --> 00:39:43,617
if you visualize what you want,

628
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,588
the universe will supply it.

629
00:39:56,023 --> 00:39:57,169
Where'd you go?

630
00:39:58,136 --> 00:39:59,901
I just had the most amazing
vision of what

631
00:40:00,014 --> 00:40:02,127
it was going to be like
when we got clean tomorrow.

632
00:40:02,373 --> 00:40:04,563
- Did I look like a movie star?
- Yes.

633
00:40:06,356 --> 00:40:08,985
I'm so glad you didn't do
that degrading movie.

634
00:40:09,236 --> 00:40:10,198
Me, too, babe.

635
00:40:12,312 --> 00:40:14,058
So how did you get this from Rob

636
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,227
if we didn't have any money left
to pay for it?

637
00:40:16,656 --> 00:40:18,084
I told him he could crash here.

638
00:40:18,206 --> 00:40:20,086
He got kicked out of
his apartment again.

639
00:40:23,697 --> 00:40:25,312
I need to check on him.

640
00:40:56,971 --> 00:40:58,770
Yes, and I'm totally in
for saturday night.

641
00:41:00,755 --> 00:41:04,269
I got us a V.I.P. booth.
Ok, see you then.

642
00:41:09,221 --> 00:41:11,975
Mom, are you ok? What's going on?

643
00:41:17,284 --> 00:41:20,049
You and Julia finally broke up.
Thank you, god.

644
00:41:20,362 --> 00:41:21,827
They're your clothes, Eden.

645
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:31,019
what's going on here?

646
00:41:32,525 --> 00:41:35,023
I saw the signs.
I just didn't want to believe it.

647
00:41:35,279 --> 00:41:38,321
- What? What are you talking about?
- We found these in your bedroom.

648
00:41:41,863 --> 00:41:43,619
You were snooping in my stuff?

649
00:41:43,971 --> 00:41:47,281
After Christian called and said you
came by the office and stole them

650
00:41:47,542 --> 00:41:48,929
earlier that day, I--

651
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:50,600
Stole them? What?
No, he gave them to me.

652
00:41:50,712 --> 00:41:51,811
Stop pretending.

653
00:41:51,937 --> 00:41:54,239
You're a drug addict,
and the drugs make you lie

654
00:41:54,464 --> 00:41:55,659
and hurt people.

655
00:41:56,035 --> 00:41:57,336
You need professional help.

656
00:42:00,228 --> 00:42:01,261
You're good.

657
00:42:01,575 --> 00:42:02,805
i'll give you that.

658
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:07,473
So, you're kicking me to the curb,
mom?

659
00:42:07,789 --> 00:42:09,536
Eden, I'm Mrs. Feeney.

660
00:42:09,668 --> 00:42:12,203
I'm from the Shelter drug
rehabilitation center.

661
00:42:12,924 --> 00:42:13,882
Rehab.

662
00:42:14,946 --> 00:42:18,339
There's been a bed reserved for you.
You'll be there for six weeks.

663
00:42:18,493 --> 00:42:22,378
and if you don't stay the entire time,
Christian will press charges.

664
00:42:22,863 --> 00:42:24,084
And I support him.

665
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:28,334
If you don't cooperate,
you'll go to jail.

666
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,335
We just want to get you better.

667
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:36,231
You son of a bitch!
You can't do this to me!

668
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:37,791
You think you're going
to get away with this?

669
00:42:37,904 --> 00:42:39,406
This is classic addict behavior.

670
00:42:39,541 --> 00:42:41,711
Denial, rage, unwilling
to take responsibility.

671
00:42:43,402 --> 00:42:45,797
I hope you all enjoy
the next six weeks,

672
00:42:47,162 --> 00:42:48,383
because when I come back,

673
00:42:49,106 --> 00:42:51,125
Sean is going to know everything.

674
00:42:53,086 --> 00:42:54,090
That's a promise.

675
00:42:59,422 --> 00:43:01,317
Sweetheart,
I think we did the right thing.

676
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,451
What are you doing here?

677
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:35,624
I came to tell you I won't be needing
you as my best man anymore,

678
00:43:37,388 --> 00:43:39,707
at least not in the foreseeable future.

679
00:43:44,006 --> 00:43:45,696
Something happened with Kate?

680
00:43:55,536 --> 00:43:56,804
You were married 20 years.

681
00:43:56,916 --> 00:43:58,974
Maybe you just don't know
how to be alone anymore.

682
00:44:01,782 --> 00:44:03,059
It's more than that.

683
00:44:04,944 --> 00:44:06,784
I think I never got over Julia.

684
00:44:09,891 --> 00:44:11,196
I'm still in love with her.

685
00:44:15,226 --> 00:44:16,109
Really.

686
00:44:23,324 --> 00:44:25,052
I think I'll get me one of those.

687
00:44:46,532 --> 00:44:48,983
