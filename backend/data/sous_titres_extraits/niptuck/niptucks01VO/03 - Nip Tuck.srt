1
00:00:08,434 --> 00:00:10,163
<i>Previously on Nip / Tuck:</i>

2
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,100
-I fixed your clog.
-Yeah?

3
00:00:13,172 --> 00:00:14,969
And I found this.

4
00:00:15,441 --> 00:00:17,773
Does it turn you off that I'm not...

5
00:00:19,345 --> 00:00:20,573
circumcised?

6
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:22,170
No, not at all.

7
00:00:22,748 --> 00:00:24,306
What are you doing?

8
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:26,107
I'm moving back in.

9
00:00:41,934 --> 00:00:45,461
So, you're telling me you've only had
two previous cosmetic surgeries.

10
00:00:45,538 --> 00:00:48,234
Two, yes. My nose
to correct a deviated septum...

11
00:00:48,307 --> 00:00:50,673
and my jaw to fix a slight overbite.

12
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:56,109
Mr. Diamond, do you make a good living
impersonating Michael Jackson?

13
00:00:56,182 --> 00:01:00,380
Yes. I have a condo here in Miami.
But I'm in Vegas 45 weeks a year.

14
00:01:00,452 --> 00:01:01,544
I'm a headliner.

15
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,056
How else do you think I can afford
another deviated septum operation?

16
00:01:05,124 --> 00:01:07,592
And it looks like Michael's
just had another one.

17
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,685
He's such a beautiful person.

18
00:01:16,335 --> 00:01:18,735
Well, how about a bleaching peel then?

19
00:01:18,838 --> 00:01:21,238
Mr. Diamond,
I'm gonna be honest with you.

20
00:01:21,307 --> 00:01:25,038
You need to stop having surgeries.
Particularly rhinoplasties.

21
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,568
What's more important to you?
Looking like your idol, or breathing?

22
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:33,173
Excuse me, Christian.
Sean has a consult waiting in his office.

23
00:01:33,252 --> 00:01:36,881
He called and asked if you could step in.
He has an emergency at home.

24
00:01:36,956 --> 00:01:39,686
-What kind of emergency?
-Didn't say.

25
00:01:40,526 --> 00:01:43,620
Liz, if you'll escort
Mr. Diamond out, please.

26
00:01:46,765 --> 00:01:48,665
<i>I loved you in The Wiz.</i>

27
00:01:53,005 --> 00:01:55,940
Dr. Troy, I have been waiting in the lobby
for 20 minutes!

28
00:01:56,008 --> 00:01:58,943
Mrs. Grubman, you didn't have
an appointment.

29
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:05,915
But, as you know, I'm always here for you.

30
00:02:07,653 --> 00:02:09,314
Tell me about your problem.

31
00:02:09,388 --> 00:02:12,721
The problem is, I don't know
how you expect me to recover...

32
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:15,282
from a tummy tuck on shitty sheets.

33
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:19,627
Mrs. Grubman, the sheets in
our recovery center are 250-count Frette.

34
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:21,489
I picked them out myself.

35
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:24,661
You call them 250-count.
I call them sandpaper.

36
00:02:25,304 --> 00:02:29,502
Frette sheets are hotel sheets,
and I'm sorry, but if I'm gonna heal...

37
00:02:29,808 --> 00:02:32,174
I need comfort, not durability.

38
00:02:34,847 --> 00:02:39,682
Mrs. Grubman, how do you feel
about Pratesi, 400-count?

39
00:02:40,252 --> 00:02:43,585
Dr. Troy, I expect nothing less.

40
00:02:52,898 --> 00:02:55,423
What's going on, Matt? Are you okay?

41
00:02:56,402 --> 00:02:58,336
I'm gonna be fine, Mom.

42
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:01,129
Right? I'm gonna be fine.

43
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,676
Take the ice pack off. Let me see.

44
00:03:06,845 --> 00:03:10,110
I changed your diaper hundreds of times.
l've seen it.

45
00:03:11,784 --> 00:03:13,012
Come on.

46
00:03:32,037 --> 00:03:36,474
You took a chunk out of your foreskin
and lacerated the opening of your urethra.

47
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:39,610
I can apply a slight pressure bandage.

48
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:42,311
That'll get you through
the next couple of hours.

49
00:03:42,381 --> 00:03:43,871
And then what?

50
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:48,179
And then, later today,
you're coming into the office...

51
00:03:48,253 --> 00:03:50,813
and I'm gonna give you
a proper circumcision.

52
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:53,016
-No shit?
-On one condition.

53
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:55,589
You start communicating with me.

54
00:03:55,661 --> 00:04:00,121
lf there's something about your body you
want changed, a nipple ring, whatever...

55
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,225
we talk it out
before you try self-mutilation.

56
00:04:03,602 --> 00:04:06,537
And if you have questions about sex,
for instance...

57
00:04:06,605 --> 00:04:09,699
how to find and stimulate the clitoris,
you come to me.

58
00:04:09,775 --> 00:04:12,505
I want to be involved in your life, Matt.

59
00:04:13,112 --> 00:04:14,204
Deal?

60
00:04:19,952 --> 00:04:21,078
Deal.

61
00:05:08,033 --> 00:05:11,161
Miss Babcock, tell me
what you don't like about yourself.

62
00:05:12,404 --> 00:05:13,769
Everything.

63
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,868
-Dr. Troy?
-Yes.

64
00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:21,737
Grace Santiago.

65
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,212
I'm the new psychologist.

66
00:05:25,651 --> 00:05:28,119
We have one already: Dr. Pendleton.

67
00:05:28,187 --> 00:05:30,451
I guess he didn't work out.

68
00:05:31,723 --> 00:05:34,089
I don't want to intrude. I can come back.

69
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,683
No, please.

70
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,160
Have a seat.

71
00:05:50,342 --> 00:05:53,004
Hi. Grace. Nice to meet you.

72
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:01,809
Miss Babcock, tell me specifically
what you're interested in having done.

73
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:03,952
I need liposuction...

74
00:06:04,356 --> 00:06:06,916
under my chin. Everywhere.

75
00:06:07,392 --> 00:06:11,351
I hate the bump on my nose.
I hate my breasts.

76
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,191
And my stomach has stretch marks.

77
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,067
They make me sick.

78
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:18,135
l'd like those to go away.

79
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:22,167
Dr. Troy, could I see
Miss Babcock's patient form?

80
00:06:30,782 --> 00:06:33,774
Miss Babcock, you're
interested in changing a lot of things.

81
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:37,618
l've been saving up my money for this.
I drove all the way here from Port Lucy.

82
00:06:39,725 --> 00:06:42,523
I'm going to my 10-year class reunion
in a month.

83
00:06:42,594 --> 00:06:44,824
I want to go as a new person.

84
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:49,032
Someone they don't recognize
as a girl they used to call "Sasquatch."

85
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:54,597
I think we can send you off to that
class reunion feeling better about yourself.

86
00:06:55,674 --> 00:06:56,902
Really?

87
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:58,874
You'll help me?

88
00:07:00,746 --> 00:07:03,943
Thank you so much. I can't tell you how....

89
00:07:12,024 --> 00:07:14,356
No food 12 hours before surgery.

90
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:18,530
Matt, you've never even
had your tonsils out.

91
00:07:18,864 --> 00:07:21,196
Are you sure you wanna do this?

92
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,797
It's important to me, Mom.

93
00:07:23,969 --> 00:07:27,336
-And Dad agrees, so....
-No, I don't agree.

94
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:30,574
What you did has to be corrected
by a professional.

95
00:07:30,642 --> 00:07:33,941
I'm doing your circumcision
out of medical necessity.

96
00:07:34,146 --> 00:07:36,979
Before we leave, you need to
shave your genital region.

97
00:07:37,049 --> 00:07:38,277
Carefully.

98
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,917
And the humiliations
just keep on coming, don't they?

99
00:07:48,894 --> 00:07:50,384
I don't like this.

100
00:07:50,462 --> 00:07:52,987
He'll be fine. I promise.

101
00:07:57,035 --> 00:07:58,468
I'll get it.

102
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:07,609
Good morning. Officer Stone.
Miami-Dade Police Department.

103
00:08:13,218 --> 00:08:14,583
Come on in.

104
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,084
May I speak to Julia McNamara, please?

105
00:08:17,489 --> 00:08:20,356
I'm Julia McNamara. ls there a problem?

106
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:22,026
Actually, yes.

107
00:08:22,094 --> 00:08:25,530
Mrs. McNamara, the State of Florida
has a huge problem with anybody...

108
00:08:25,597 --> 00:08:27,861
who would torture and kill an animal.

109
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:32,336
Your plumber has notified us
about his discovery and filed a complaint.

110
00:08:33,205 --> 00:08:36,197
-I'll get my purse.
-Mrs. McNamara, I'm not arresting you.

111
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:40,473
See, in this state, killing an animal
is not a crime. It's a misdemeanor.

112
00:08:40,545 --> 00:08:44,072
So you have the choice of attending
an animal anger management class...

113
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,117
or paying a $5,000 fine.

114
00:08:46,285 --> 00:08:49,049
Detective, a huge mistake
has been made here.

115
00:08:49,121 --> 00:08:51,919
My wife won't even let me put
a bug zapper in the backyard.

116
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,821
She didn't kill anything.

117
00:08:55,193 --> 00:08:57,093
Yes, Sean, I did.

118
00:09:04,436 --> 00:09:06,233
Julia killed Frisky.

119
00:09:06,905 --> 00:09:10,102
This is very disturbing to me.
That she's capable of that.

120
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,405
l've got a son
who tried to cut off his penis...

121
00:09:12,477 --> 00:09:14,308
a wife who flushed a gerbil.

122
00:09:14,446 --> 00:09:17,244
<i>It's like l've moved back into Hell House.</i>

123
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:21,744
So are we gonna communicate
at all today...

124
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,653
or are you gonna continue
to pout like a 6-year-old?

125
00:09:24,723 --> 00:09:26,884
Kiss my tan, waxed ass, Sean.

126
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:30,059
Why did you fire Pendleton
without consulting me?

127
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:33,756
That was wrong.
I should have checked with you first.

128
00:09:33,832 --> 00:09:36,300
But I was justified.
I fired him because he's a racist.

129
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:39,633
Bullshit. You fired him because
you weren't the most brilliant kid...

130
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:42,765
on the playground anymore,
and that bugged the shit out of you.

131
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:45,776
75% of our patients are women, Christian.

132
00:09:45,844 --> 00:09:48,904
I think our clientele would, in many cases,
be more comfortable...

133
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,211
discussing their concerns
with someone of the same gender.

134
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:54,752
This hire might just be
a boost in the marketplace.

135
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,050
You know, Sean,
I'm gonna throw you this bone...

136
00:09:57,122 --> 00:09:59,682
because hiring a shrink
gives you a moral comfort zone.

137
00:09:59,758 --> 00:10:02,522
lf you need it to stay
in this profession with me, fine.

138
00:10:02,594 --> 00:10:05,495
I'll take that bullet. But be honest here.

139
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:09,796
Admit you hired Grace Santiago
because you want to get into her pants.

140
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:26,343
Uncle Chris, what are you doing here?

141
00:10:26,985 --> 00:10:30,079
You're the most important patient
we've ever operated on, Matty.

142
00:10:30,155 --> 00:10:32,885
We're just taking extra precautions,
that's all.

143
00:10:34,326 --> 00:10:36,419
Okay, guys. Ready when you are.

144
00:10:39,664 --> 00:10:41,029
I'm afraid.

145
00:10:46,905 --> 00:10:48,600
You're gonna be fine, Matt.

146
00:10:48,673 --> 00:10:51,836
I wouldn't do this
unless I could guarantee that.

147
00:10:52,511 --> 00:10:55,605
I want you to count back from 10, okay?

148
00:10:55,981 --> 00:10:56,970
Okay.

149
00:10:57,849 --> 00:10:59,908
Ten, nine....

150
00:11:05,257 --> 00:11:07,350
All right, let's do this. Clamp.

151
00:11:08,693 --> 00:11:09,955
Hemostat.

152
00:11:11,196 --> 00:11:12,424
Scalpel.

153
00:11:27,712 --> 00:11:31,045
Let me do it. You're nervous.
That's understandable.

154
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,178
I'm fine. I want to do this.

155
00:11:33,251 --> 00:11:37,779
It's okay. We'll trade. You do Grubman's
tummy tuck afterwards. I'll do Matt.

156
00:13:00,505 --> 00:13:04,373
Dr. Troy, I have the results
of Nanette Babcock's blood prelim.

157
00:13:04,476 --> 00:13:07,673
She didn't test positive for lithium
or any similar generic.

158
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,475
How nobly efficient of you.

159
00:13:09,681 --> 00:13:11,239
I'm just trying to do my job.

160
00:13:11,316 --> 00:13:13,648
Well, your job is not necessary.

161
00:13:13,718 --> 00:13:15,083
ls there a problem?

162
00:13:15,153 --> 00:13:17,417
A potential patient's blood prelim
just came back.

163
00:13:17,489 --> 00:13:19,821
ln good conscience,
I don't see how we operate on...

164
00:13:19,891 --> 00:13:22,553
a manic-depressive resisting drug therapy.

165
00:13:22,627 --> 00:13:25,061
I would agree with that diagnosis.

166
00:13:27,232 --> 00:13:30,565
Sean, I need to speak to you in my office.

167
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,425
Now.

168
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:40,476
This how it'll be? You'll listen to Salsa
Spice over the judgment of your partner?

169
00:13:40,545 --> 00:13:42,843
Since we've agreed
to hire a psychologist...

170
00:13:42,914 --> 00:13:45,314
we're obliged to follow
that person's expert advice.

171
00:13:45,383 --> 00:13:47,943
Particularly when the medical history
sets off an alarm.

172
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:50,579
Nanette Babcock could
benefit from some select surgeries.

173
00:13:50,655 --> 00:13:53,123
Sometimes giving a nose job
changes their lives...

174
00:13:53,191 --> 00:13:55,853
in more profound ways
than a lifetime of mood controllers.

175
00:13:55,927 --> 00:13:58,623
We can't take on every patient
who files through our doors.

176
00:13:58,697 --> 00:14:00,324
You forgetting
what happened a month ago?

177
00:14:00,398 --> 00:14:01,831
Are you saying I have no ethics?

178
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,767
I'm saying you have a history
of liking your money.

179
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,762
Screw you, Sean.

180
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,101
I have a discriminating eye.
Today, I turned down Michael Jackson.

181
00:14:14,012 --> 00:14:17,709
You know the dangers inherent
in manic-depressive patients.

182
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,111
You want medical stats,
how about this one?

183
00:14:20,185 --> 00:14:22,983
Women who have breast implants
are three times more likely...

184
00:14:23,054 --> 00:14:25,113
to kill themselves than women who don't.

185
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,988
Does that mean we're not
stuffing any more tits in this office?

186
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:32,496
I'm sure you'll agree that now is not
the time to flirt with any degree of risk.

187
00:14:34,466 --> 00:14:37,060
Dr. Santiago made the right call here.

188
00:14:39,371 --> 00:14:43,171
Do you want to call Miss Babcock,
or should I have her do it?

189
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,497
Hello?

190
00:15:10,101 --> 00:15:12,126
Miss Babcock, it's Dr. Troy.

191
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:15,502
<i>I'm afraid we can't
do your surgeries on Monday.</i>

192
00:15:16,174 --> 00:15:17,937
But I can't reschedule.

193
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm on deadline for my reunion.

194
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:22,911
I'll barely heal in time
from the bruising as it is now.

195
00:15:23,782 --> 00:15:25,716
I'm not calling to reschedule.

196
00:15:26,618 --> 00:15:27,744
<i>Miss Babcock?</i>

197
00:15:27,819 --> 00:15:31,949
Look, I know I'm fat. But I have been
working my ass off, literally.

198
00:15:32,023 --> 00:15:35,322
Nurse Linda told me to try and lose
10 pounds before the surgeries...

199
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:38,658
that I would recover faster if I did.
And I'm trying.

200
00:15:39,931 --> 00:15:42,798
That's not the reason
we're not gonna do your surgeries.

201
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:44,596
Then why aren't you, then?

202
00:15:44,669 --> 00:15:48,196
You said you could make me look better!
I need to look better!

203
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,338
Miss Babcock, we're declining your case...

204
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:54,572
<i>because we feel like
you have unrealistic expectations.</i>

205
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,446
<i>But every doctor has their own criteria.</i>

206
00:15:57,515 --> 00:16:00,177
<i>l'd like to recommend my colleague,
Dr. Martin Hargrove.</i>

207
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:04,119
I don't have time to do a consultation
and the scheduling all over again!

208
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:06,384
I need to look different now!

209
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,517
You stop playing mind games with me.

210
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:11,562
lf you want me to pay more money,
I'll pay it.

211
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:13,494
It's not about money, Miss Babcock, it's--

212
00:16:13,565 --> 00:16:15,430
I hope you get cancer!

213
00:17:05,383 --> 00:17:06,782
Did it hurt?

214
00:17:09,187 --> 00:17:10,745
You were worth it.

215
00:17:16,961 --> 00:17:19,225
The stitches come out next week.

216
00:17:19,764 --> 00:17:21,891
We can do it anytime after that.

217
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,070
Matt, have you urinated yet, today?

218
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:31,738
Buzzkill.

219
00:17:33,378 --> 00:17:34,777
-Later.
-Bye.

220
00:17:42,387 --> 00:17:43,945
Why do you want to see this?

221
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:45,751
I had to suture your urinarius.

222
00:17:45,824 --> 00:17:47,815
I wanna be sure
there's no blood in the urine.

223
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:50,622
That could be a sign
of internal hemorrhaging.

224
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:53,289
And I want to be here to support you.

225
00:17:54,566 --> 00:17:56,227
Why do I need that?

226
00:17:56,301 --> 00:17:59,236
The first time you pee,
after an operation of this nature...

227
00:17:59,304 --> 00:18:01,534
it's gonna feel like you're pissing fire.

228
00:18:01,606 --> 00:18:05,042
Just press down on my hand
and scream if you want.

229
00:18:05,243 --> 00:18:07,234
Nobody's gonna judge you.

230
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,340
I don't need to hold your hand, Dad.

231
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,384
And just give me some privacy?

232
00:18:30,835 --> 00:18:33,269
Vanessa's a little hardbody, Matt.

233
00:18:34,105 --> 00:18:37,768
Looks like you're dating
a future prom queen. Congratulations.

234
00:18:45,884 --> 00:18:47,374
I can't dance.

235
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:50,351
Okay, let's come back in an hour then.

236
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:51,683
No, l....

237
00:18:52,523 --> 00:18:55,083
I really can't dance.
You're right about the prom thing.

238
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:57,320
She's already asked me to go.

239
00:18:58,162 --> 00:19:00,426
And I don't know how to dance.

240
00:19:04,302 --> 00:19:05,826
Well, that's okay.

241
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:07,898
Neither could l.

242
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,968
You just say, "Not my thing."

243
00:19:14,078 --> 00:19:15,136
This works?

244
00:19:15,213 --> 00:19:17,909
I didn't even have to dance
at my own wedding.

245
00:19:18,249 --> 00:19:21,241
Women like it
when there's some mystery there.

246
00:19:29,827 --> 00:19:31,021
Thanks.

247
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,529
Shit, it's coming!

248
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:38,829
Hand.

249
00:20:10,468 --> 00:20:11,935
-Hello?
-Where are you?

250
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:14,267
We have a his-and-her lipo in half an hour.

251
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:15,829
Car trouble. I'll be there.

252
00:20:15,907 --> 00:20:20,037
Since l've got you, why did you schedule
another neck lift for Mrs. Grubman?

253
00:20:20,411 --> 00:20:22,242
I didn't schedule that operation.

254
00:20:22,313 --> 00:20:24,144
<i>Who did then? The Filofax fairy?</i>

255
00:20:24,215 --> 00:20:27,878
I'm here reviewing next month's surgeries,
and here it is, on the 15th.

256
00:20:27,952 --> 00:20:30,546
I'm telling you,
I didn't schedule that operation.

257
00:20:30,621 --> 00:20:33,522
I sliced that bitch's wattle off
15 months ago.

258
00:20:33,591 --> 00:20:34,990
That's what I thought.

259
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:38,290
Call Mrs. Grubman and tell her
you made a scheduling mistake.

260
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:40,160
I'll see you in a few.

261
00:20:46,637 --> 00:20:51,336
Dr. Troy, what a nice surprise.
I'm healing beautifully.

262
00:20:51,676 --> 00:20:56,045
What a doll you are to check up on me.
Listen, since l've got you on the horn...

263
00:20:56,114 --> 00:20:58,912
how many Ambiens should I take
if I want to sleep through...

264
00:20:58,983 --> 00:21:02,248
the entire 8-hour flight
and wake up refreshed in Tahiti?

265
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,948
Mrs. Grubman, who signed you up
for another neck lift?

266
00:21:05,023 --> 00:21:07,287
<i>I did it myself,
with the girl at the front desk.</i>

267
00:21:07,358 --> 00:21:11,260
You were with a patient,
and you made it clear I'm not to interrupt.

268
00:21:11,329 --> 00:21:13,160
I didn't approve that operation.

269
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:16,166
Look, I'm co-hosting a benefit
with Blaine Trump next month...

270
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:17,758
and I need to look my best.

271
00:21:17,835 --> 00:21:21,134
Never schedule another operation
without my consent. Am I clear?

272
00:21:22,707 --> 00:21:24,675
I don't like your tone, Dr. Troy.

273
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:28,007
The next time you speak to me that way,
take a minute to remember...

274
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:31,105
who's keeping you in those Gucci suits
you love so much.

275
00:21:31,182 --> 00:21:34,777
Ma'am, I need you to clear your pockets
and go through again.

276
00:21:34,852 --> 00:21:37,878
Loosen your braids and take a look.
Do I look like a terrorist?

277
00:21:37,955 --> 00:21:40,753
Ma'am, I need you to go through again.

278
00:21:41,292 --> 00:21:44,261
Put your phone
in the clearance basket, please.

279
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:45,994
Mrs. Grubman?

280
00:21:46,197 --> 00:21:47,858
Hold on, Dr. Troy.

281
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:56,467
Ma'am.

282
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,510
I am keeping the maintenance
as scheduled, Dr. Troy.

283
00:21:59,577 --> 00:22:03,877
No, you're not! lt goes against
ASAPS guidelines. It's not ethical!

284
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,781
Please, Dr. Troy.
Since when have you ever been ethical?

285
00:22:07,018 --> 00:22:08,986
Mrs. Grubman, that's it.
I'm cutting you off!

286
00:22:09,053 --> 00:22:11,886
My office will no longer
schedule surgeries with you.

287
00:22:13,091 --> 00:22:14,353
Dr. Troy!

288
00:22:15,693 --> 00:22:17,718
-Hello?
-Ma'am, I need--

289
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:21,424
Look, your machine is broke!
I am not missing that flight!

290
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,696
We've got a runner.

291
00:22:37,582 --> 00:22:40,176
As you can see, here is the cautery tip...

292
00:22:40,251 --> 00:22:43,186
you left inside my client's stomach
after her tummy tuck.

293
00:22:43,254 --> 00:22:47,190
Without doubt, this is the metal object
that set off the airport security system...

294
00:22:47,258 --> 00:22:49,226
and led to the assault of my client.

295
00:22:49,293 --> 00:22:53,457
She had the object quietly removed
by her private physician...

296
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:56,322
at considerable pain and expense.

297
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:02,506
Mrs. Grubman, let me begin by saying
how truly sorry--

298
00:23:02,573 --> 00:23:06,600
Dr. McNamara, seeing as this incident,
top to bottom...

299
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:08,542
was caused by your partner...

300
00:23:08,613 --> 00:23:11,446
I think it is he who should apologize.

301
00:23:19,757 --> 00:23:22,692
Mr. Ambrose, what kind of reparations
are you looking for?

302
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,625
$10 million.

303
00:23:24,996 --> 00:23:26,657
Not a penny less.

304
00:23:26,797 --> 00:23:30,198
God damn it! You should have done
an instrument count, Liz!

305
00:23:30,268 --> 00:23:31,360
I did.

306
00:23:31,435 --> 00:23:34,404
This has never happened to me before.
I am always so careful.

307
00:23:34,472 --> 00:23:37,999
Apparently, not careful enough!
We could lose the business over this!

308
00:23:38,075 --> 00:23:40,407
I cannot believe your ineptitude!

309
00:23:40,478 --> 00:23:42,139
-Sean--
-Hold on, Christian.

310
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:44,306
This is between me and him.

311
00:23:44,615 --> 00:23:48,483
You examined Grubman's belly after
I did an instrument check, correct, Sean?

312
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:50,544
I mean, that's protocol.

313
00:23:52,823 --> 00:23:53,949
Wait.

314
00:23:54,292 --> 00:23:57,523
Are we to believe from your silence
that maybe you didn't do it...

315
00:23:57,595 --> 00:24:01,395
because you were too distracted
with your son's circumcision?

316
00:24:01,632 --> 00:24:03,827
What ineptitude!

317
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:08,637
-Liz, look, I'm upset.
-Screw it!

318
00:24:09,273 --> 00:24:11,764
I should never have come back here!

319
00:24:12,343 --> 00:24:14,709
-I am resigning!
-No, you're not.

320
00:24:14,812 --> 00:24:17,474
Liz, please, can you give us a minute?

321
00:24:26,224 --> 00:24:28,055
I can't believe this.

322
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,187
lronic, isn't it?

323
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:36,563
That after years of my enduring
your "be more responsible" lectures...

324
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:38,897
you're the one who screwed us.

325
00:24:43,241 --> 00:24:47,200
Look, we have malpractice insurance
precisely for this reason.

326
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:49,371
lf we pay out, we are screwed, Christian.

327
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:52,575
Our rates triple, and then basically
we're working to break even.

328
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:56,586
What if she goes to the media?
Our professional lives are over!

329
00:25:01,826 --> 00:25:03,726
You have to go to her.

330
00:25:06,764 --> 00:25:08,732
-Me?
-She likes you. She trusts you.

331
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,768
lf you hadn't cut her off,
she wouldn't have been so vindictive.

332
00:25:11,836 --> 00:25:14,600
-I cut her off because of you.
-I didn't ask you to do that.

333
00:25:14,672 --> 00:25:17,300
No? You're the one
who was constantly berating me...

334
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:19,400
about my supposed lack of ethics.

335
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:21,206
You're the reason I dumped Grubman...

336
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,578
and the reason Nanette Babcock
pulled a goddamn Glenn Close on my car.

337
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:27,618
-What are you saying?
-I wanted to handle her differently...

338
00:25:27,685 --> 00:25:31,621
make her feel better about herself,
but you and your new piece-of-ass hire--

339
00:25:31,689 --> 00:25:33,589
I am not interested in her in that way!

340
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:36,821
...went all draconian on me,
and she trashed my car!

341
00:25:39,263 --> 00:25:42,721
Your fingerprints are all over
both crime scenes, Sean.

342
00:25:42,867 --> 00:25:45,301
How many women
have you screwed over, Christian?

343
00:25:45,369 --> 00:25:46,927
A hundred? A thousand?

344
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:49,302
lt could easily be one of them.

345
00:25:51,042 --> 00:25:52,703
She did it, Sean.

346
00:25:57,148 --> 00:26:00,675
You deal with Grubman.
I'll investigate Nanette Babcock.

347
00:26:01,552 --> 00:26:02,917
With Grace.

348
00:26:09,393 --> 00:26:10,587
Hello?

349
00:26:18,636 --> 00:26:20,126
Miss Babcock?

350
00:26:56,307 --> 00:26:58,036
What are you doing?

351
00:26:58,642 --> 00:27:01,736
I'm sorry. I knocked on the door
and it opened.

352
00:27:02,012 --> 00:27:04,242
You didn't answer my question.

353
00:27:05,449 --> 00:27:07,349
The doctors and I were worried.

354
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:09,352
I came by to see how you were doing.

355
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,217
I'm doing my laundry.

356
00:27:11,722 --> 00:27:13,485
I'm making my lunch.

357
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:16,752
I'm not going to my reunion.

358
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:18,959
That's what I'm doing.

359
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:27,094
You went off your lithium.

360
00:27:27,571 --> 00:27:30,005
Does your treating psychologist
know about that?

361
00:27:30,074 --> 00:27:32,304
I quit seeing him a month ago.

362
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:35,243
He couldn't do anything
to make me feel better.

363
00:27:35,312 --> 00:27:37,303
That's why I came to you.

364
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:40,077
You guys did a shitty job at that, too.

365
00:27:41,051 --> 00:27:43,019
You see what I'm eating?

366
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,021
Bullshit low-fat turkey with no bread.

367
00:27:47,425 --> 00:27:49,484
The lithium made me gain weight.

368
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,188
I needed to be thinner for my reunion.

369
00:27:52,263 --> 00:27:54,493
That's why I quit. Cold turkey.

370
00:27:56,901 --> 00:27:59,699
Jim Reconia was gonna be at my reunion.

371
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,070
I bet he would have loved you.

372
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:09,602
You with your perfect face
and your tight ass...

373
00:28:10,014 --> 00:28:13,745
and your tits that don't sag
down to an elastic waistband...

374
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:15,945
that you don't have to wear.

375
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,280
I hate girls like you.

376
00:28:20,591 --> 00:28:23,219
You always get the Jims of this world.

377
00:28:24,628 --> 00:28:27,062
Was Jim a friend of yours, Nanette?

378
00:28:27,131 --> 00:28:28,996
He was the class president.

379
00:28:29,066 --> 00:28:32,229
I read on classmates.com
that he was recently divorced.

380
00:28:32,303 --> 00:28:34,931
I thought maybe if I looked prettier...

381
00:28:35,372 --> 00:28:37,135
like one of them...

382
00:28:37,975 --> 00:28:39,636
he'd notice me...

383
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:42,005
and strike up a conversation.

384
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,643
But you ruined that.

385
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:48,615
And you retaliated
by vandalizing Dr. Troy's car?

386
00:28:49,053 --> 00:28:50,850
You think I would do that?

387
00:28:50,921 --> 00:28:52,821
Because if I'm ugly...

388
00:28:53,324 --> 00:28:56,316
naturally I'm a crazy bitch, too.

389
00:28:56,393 --> 00:28:57,883
ls that right?

390
00:28:58,929 --> 00:29:03,025
Ms. Babcock, nothing that happens
in a doctor's office is personal.

391
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,501
You rejecting me
and ruining my dream is personal!

392
00:29:06,737 --> 00:29:09,831
You not making me the best I can be,
is personal!

393
00:29:10,074 --> 00:29:11,837
I get rejected all the time!

394
00:29:11,909 --> 00:29:14,878
But when I offer to pay
and still get rejected...

395
00:29:14,945 --> 00:29:17,038
that is personal!

396
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:24,020
Please leave.

397
00:29:38,636 --> 00:29:41,161
Sorry to keep you waiting, Dr. Troy.

398
00:29:41,438 --> 00:29:43,531
I was held up on the phone.

399
00:29:43,674 --> 00:29:46,507
Well, you know how hysterical
young women can get...

400
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:49,603
when they find out
their only mother almost died...

401
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,580
on the operating table.

402
00:29:51,682 --> 00:29:55,118
Now, Mrs. Grubman,
you didn't almost die on our table.

403
00:29:55,452 --> 00:29:57,317
You didn't even suffer from sepsis--

404
00:29:57,388 --> 00:29:59,686
Oh, drop the tough love bullshit.

405
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:02,988
You drove all the way to Palm Beach
from your Miami butcher shop...

406
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,052
and I'm sure it was to grovel,
not to lecture.

407
00:30:08,299 --> 00:30:09,630
I'm sorry.

408
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:12,358
Yeah, well, it's too late for sorry.

409
00:30:12,469 --> 00:30:13,663
Drink?

410
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:15,594
Absolut, neat.

411
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:29,144
A toast. To closing you down.

412
00:30:31,355 --> 00:30:34,290
Why are you doing this?
You don't need the goddamn money.

413
00:30:34,358 --> 00:30:36,349
Your husband left you everything
when he died.

414
00:30:36,427 --> 00:30:38,588
I'm doing this because you betrayed me.

415
00:30:38,662 --> 00:30:40,425
I didn't betray you.

416
00:30:40,864 --> 00:30:42,058
I was negligent and left...

417
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:45,101
-a cautery tip in your stomach.
-I could give a shit about that!

418
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:47,967
-Then why are you suing me?
-Because you left me.

419
00:30:48,939 --> 00:30:51,533
You left me after I was loyal to you.

420
00:30:52,676 --> 00:30:55,076
Oh, you think you made me...

421
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:59,643
with your implants and your collagen
and your magic scalpel.

422
00:30:59,717 --> 00:31:02,379
But the truth is, I made you.

423
00:31:03,187 --> 00:31:05,621
I sent you all my society friends.

424
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:08,249
I even threw cocktail parties
in your honor...

425
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:10,987
to get you known in all the right circles.

426
00:31:11,061 --> 00:31:14,326
And now, dumping me like one of your
one-night whores...

427
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:15,888
is the thanks I get?

428
00:31:15,966 --> 00:31:17,593
I deserve better.

429
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,633
God damn this brace.

430
00:31:21,872 --> 00:31:24,670
It's like the hands of a killer
around my neck!

431
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:04,871
My decision was correct, Mrs. Grubman.
I just went about it the wrong way.

432
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:09,376
Actually, I stopped working
on you because....

433
00:32:12,856 --> 00:32:15,188
Because you were my masterpiece.

434
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,661
There were no more strokes
to be made on your canvas.

435
00:32:19,763 --> 00:32:22,254
After the tummy tuck, I realized:

436
00:32:23,033 --> 00:32:25,661
"She's perfect now. My work is done."

437
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,570
You're a goddamn liar.

438
00:32:35,045 --> 00:32:36,535
Keep rubbing.

439
00:32:39,283 --> 00:32:41,217
But if truth be told...

440
00:32:41,985 --> 00:32:44,112
that always was my fantasy.

441
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:48,888
That you'd look at me one day,
and think I was beautiful.

442
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:51,450
That you made me beautiful.

443
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:55,660
That you would want me.

444
00:33:02,639 --> 00:33:05,039
No more knots. I think I'm done.

445
00:33:05,843 --> 00:33:07,936
Think again, Dr. Troy.

446
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:12,438
Did she intimate if you slept with her,
she'd drop the lawsuit?

447
00:33:12,516 --> 00:33:15,178
Are you telling me to stick my dick
in the Crypt Keeper...

448
00:33:15,252 --> 00:33:17,015
to make your mistake go away?

449
00:33:17,087 --> 00:33:18,577
You're right.

450
00:33:19,056 --> 00:33:21,490
You were right
about Nanette Babcock, too.

451
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:23,321
We need to put out a restraining order.

452
00:33:23,393 --> 00:33:26,226
Filing a restraining order means
involving us with the police.

453
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,457
Now is not a time
to flirt with risk, remember?

454
00:33:28,532 --> 00:33:30,864
Okay, enough. I'm gonna deal with her.

455
00:33:30,934 --> 00:33:32,925
And forget about Grubman.

456
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:36,138
I'm gonna tell her I botched the surgery.

457
00:33:36,206 --> 00:33:38,504
You shouldn't have to give in
to her demands.

458
00:33:38,575 --> 00:33:42,705
I don't know what our options are, Sean.
lf I don't, she's gonna close us down...

459
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:46,079
and I'm sorry, l've worked too hard
to end up at 40 saying...

460
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:48,880
"Welcome to Cinnabon.
How may I help you?"

461
00:33:49,686 --> 00:33:52,519
I'm gonna settle with Grubman's attorney.

462
00:33:52,589 --> 00:33:54,352
I need to pay for my screwup.

463
00:33:54,424 --> 00:33:56,915
Great, Sean, but why should I have to pay?

464
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:09,566
Vanessa?

465
00:35:06,964 --> 00:35:10,400
Oh, what a night! What an event!

466
00:35:10,701 --> 00:35:15,229
$4 million raised for spina bifida,
and you on my arm.

467
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:17,032
Not too shabby.

468
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:21,442
Get me a nightcap, would you, dear heart?

469
00:35:29,686 --> 00:35:30,710
Shit.

470
00:35:53,677 --> 00:35:55,008
Thank you.

471
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:05,505
-You want the lights on or--
-Off.

472
00:37:54,598 --> 00:37:56,065
Mrs. Grubman?

473
00:38:03,407 --> 00:38:04,897
What's wrong?

474
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,544
-It's nothing. I just....
-Tell me.

475
00:38:13,016 --> 00:38:16,452
I haven't been touched
by a man like that in 12 years.

476
00:38:19,056 --> 00:38:21,047
Not since my Marvin died.

477
00:38:25,162 --> 00:38:28,393
I know I'm pathetic,
bribing you for affection.

478
00:38:28,465 --> 00:38:30,433
Believe me, I know that.

479
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:40,098
The nights are the worst, you know.

480
00:38:42,245 --> 00:38:44,577
That's when I miss him the most.

481
00:38:48,018 --> 00:38:51,215
We used to have a little ritual,
my husband and l.

482
00:38:55,225 --> 00:38:58,058
l'd take my makeup off in the bathroom...

483
00:39:00,097 --> 00:39:03,294
and l'd get in bed all clean and bare.

484
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:09,329
He'd lean over and look at me,
and he'd say:

485
00:39:10,674 --> 00:39:13,040
"You are so beautiful."

486
00:39:18,949 --> 00:39:21,281
Oh, God.

487
00:39:25,288 --> 00:39:28,257
Oh, how sad you must think I am.

488
00:39:36,399 --> 00:39:38,731
You are beautiful, Mrs. Grubman.

489
00:39:40,203 --> 00:39:41,830
Unfortunately, we live in a world...

490
00:39:41,905 --> 00:39:45,204
where only one kind of beauty
is recognized anymore.

491
00:39:47,611 --> 00:39:51,308
But I'm telling you,
tonight, the way you worked that room...

492
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:56,308
the way you flirted with those rich guys,
batted your eyes and walked away with...

493
00:39:56,386 --> 00:39:59,651
a $100,000 check
for a cause that needs you...

494
00:40:01,725 --> 00:40:05,126
that was beautiful to me.

495
00:40:07,797 --> 00:40:09,128
Thank you.

496
00:40:14,804 --> 00:40:18,137
Do you know what I like best...

497
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:20,733
about your working on me, Dr. Troy?

498
00:40:21,845 --> 00:40:24,370
It's not when the bandages come off.

499
00:40:26,316 --> 00:40:29,581
It's when I'm lying there on the table,
ready to go.

500
00:40:31,254 --> 00:40:34,189
And I look up and there you are.

501
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:37,986
And you hold my hand as I go under...

502
00:40:39,029 --> 00:40:42,692
and the last words I hear you say are:

503
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,130
"Everything's gonna be okay."

504
00:40:58,515 --> 00:41:00,881
Everything's gonna be okay.

505
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:24,966
<i>Ms. Babcock, this is Sean McNamara
of McNamara / Troy.</i>

506
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:28,101
<i>You came by last week
for a consultation with my partner.</i>

507
00:41:28,178 --> 00:41:32,615
<i>I was wondering if you were available
to come back today to see me, say 2.;30?</i>

508
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:36,378
<i>Let my office know
if that time works for you. Thank you.</i>

509
00:41:52,402 --> 00:41:55,963
And don't let them bump my time.
I want to be the first one in the morning.

510
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:57,506
Mrs. Grubman.

511
00:41:58,041 --> 00:42:00,236
Dr. Troy, don't worry.

512
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:03,802
I'm not here to rekindle
any of that ugly lawsuit business.

513
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,043
I just came to schedule
some light bottom lipo.

514
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:09,815
I didn't approve that operation.

515
00:42:09,886 --> 00:42:11,319
Oh, but you will.

516
00:42:11,421 --> 00:42:13,514
And correct me if I'm wrong, Dr. Troy...

517
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:16,753
but from now on,
no matter what the operation...

518
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:18,726
there'll be no charge.

519
00:42:19,629 --> 00:42:21,494
I thought we had an understanding.

520
00:42:21,564 --> 00:42:22,929
Yes, we do.

521
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:25,695
You understand me, and I treasure that.

522
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:29,800
See you next month, Dr. Troy.

523
00:42:33,576 --> 00:42:36,807
Please tell me she hasn't decided
to reopen her lawsuit.

524
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,610
Worse. We have a lifetime pro bono.

525
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:44,487
Nanette Babcock's here.

526
00:42:44,621 --> 00:42:48,284
-You want me to sit in?
-No. I need to handle this myself.

527
00:42:51,728 --> 00:42:53,821
l'd like to do the surgeries tomorrow.

528
00:42:53,897 --> 00:42:56,331
I found this makeup
that could cover the bruises.

529
00:42:56,399 --> 00:42:58,458
I could still go to my reunion.

530
00:42:58,535 --> 00:43:01,971
But since you've inconvenienced me,
you should cut your rates.

531
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:03,471
I think that's only fair.

532
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:07,704
Ms. Babcock, I didn't call you in today
to reschedule your surgeries.

533
00:43:07,777 --> 00:43:10,041
Then why are you wasting my time?

534
00:43:10,113 --> 00:43:13,913
l've taken a personal interest in your case.
l'd really like to help you.

535
00:43:13,983 --> 00:43:16,679
You can help me by fixing my face.

536
00:43:21,825 --> 00:43:24,658
I suspect that because you've
gone off your medications...

537
00:43:24,728 --> 00:43:27,561
you are in or are nearing a manic episode.

538
00:43:29,366 --> 00:43:31,994
l'd like to recommend
you visit Dr. Marvin Sumner.

539
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:35,697
He's a friend of mine
who specializes in manic depression.

540
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:37,529
I'm not crazy.

541
00:43:39,709 --> 00:43:44,146
l've arranged for your consultation
with Dr. Sumner to be free of charge.

542
00:43:45,715 --> 00:43:49,344
I can drive you there myself, if you like.

543
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:58,652
Look, I'm really trying to do
the right thing by you.

544
00:43:59,562 --> 00:44:01,530
That's all I want to do.

545
00:44:16,379 --> 00:44:19,007
l'd like that doctor's number, please.

546
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,254
So, Annie just showed me
the Frisky doppelgänger.

547
00:44:33,329 --> 00:44:35,263
How many pet shops
did you have to go to...

548
00:44:35,331 --> 00:44:37,162
before you found one that matched?

549
00:44:37,233 --> 00:44:38,222
Four.

550
00:44:41,604 --> 00:44:43,731
Why didn't you tell her the truth?

551
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:48,534
Because she shouldn't have to pay for
the damage we've done to each other.

552
00:44:50,947 --> 00:44:53,279
I think you did the right thing.

553
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:55,544
You do?

554
00:44:56,052 --> 00:44:58,179
You're a good mother, Julia.

555
00:44:58,288 --> 00:45:00,017
You just proved it.

556
00:45:11,668 --> 00:45:13,761
I'm not going to blame you anymore...

557
00:45:13,837 --> 00:45:17,136
for me not becoming
who I always wanted to become.

558
00:45:17,907 --> 00:45:19,898
lnstead of being angry...

559
00:45:20,844 --> 00:45:23,039
I'm going back to school.

560
00:45:23,913 --> 00:45:25,540
I think that's a good idea.

561
00:45:25,615 --> 00:45:27,378
Yeah.

562
00:45:30,787 --> 00:45:34,621
By the way, Annie wants to know why
Frisky Two is dry humping Frisky One.

563
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:38,388
Oh, my God!
Did I get a female gerbil by mistake?

564
00:45:38,461 --> 00:45:40,429
You better check it out.

565
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:54,134
Come on in here.

566
00:46:02,986 --> 00:46:04,385
So tell me.

567
00:46:06,456 --> 00:46:09,186
-Tell you what?
-How did it go with Vanessa?

568
00:46:09,259 --> 00:46:11,750
The stitches are out. I figured you....

569
00:46:11,828 --> 00:46:13,227
You know.

570
00:46:14,364 --> 00:46:16,662
lt was great, Dad.

571
00:46:17,433 --> 00:46:18,900
Just great?

572
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:23,295
lt was everything I wanted it to be.

573
00:46:25,775 --> 00:46:28,369
And I want to thank you...

574
00:46:28,444 --> 00:46:31,436
for just really helping me out
and giving that to me.

575
00:46:33,383 --> 00:46:34,907
You're welcome.

576
00:46:45,562 --> 00:46:47,894
I'm gonna go wash up for dinner.

577
00:48:29,499 --> 00:48:31,831
Rip youyoup
