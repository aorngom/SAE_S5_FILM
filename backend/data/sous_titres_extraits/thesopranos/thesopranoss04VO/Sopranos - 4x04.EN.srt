1
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,375
So, she's a dancer, right?
Broadway, summer stock, all that shit.

2
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:57,112
Who was telling me, Ginny used
to do a little dancing herself, right?

3
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,650
Taught ballet years ago.

4
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,423
- Who's that?
- Nobody, Jersey.

5
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,194
Ralph Cifaretto's crew.

6
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:12,660
Anyway, I go over to her house one night...

7
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:15,901
she's dressed like a fucking cat,
like from that show.

8
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:18,402
Eye makeup, claws, the whole bit.

9
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,168
You okay?

10
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:28,575
Pardon me a minute.

11
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,929
- Donny, right?
- John, how you doing?

12
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,661
What's the matter? Not funny anymore?

13
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,530
Funny?

14
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:55,569
What's the matter with you?

15
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:56,666
Please!

16
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:58,602
Funny?

17
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,445
There's funny!

18
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,640
Whoa, what the fuck?

19
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,679
- What'd he do?
- He's a cunt.

20
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,550
A sorry sack of shit.

21
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:13,354
- Come on, let me get you out of here.
- No, please.

22
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,322
Scumbag?

23
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,323
Let me buy you a drink.

24
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,501
What the fuck?

25
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,282
What are you doing still up?

26
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,385
Penny Serenade was on AMC.

27
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,456
John, your coat!

28
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,392
Is that Burberry?

29
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,832
- Oh, my God, what happened?
- Nothing.

30
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,437
- I tripped.
- You tripped where?

31
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,237
I don't know. The steps by Carmine's.

32
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,104
John, your hand is bleeding.

33
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:07,569
I used it to break my fall.
Jesus, what is this, the inquisition now?

34
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,277
I had a few cognacs.

35
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,817
Go to sleep.

36
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:24,254
For tax- deferred growth the annuity's fine,
but if I'm hearing you right...

37
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,298
liquidity's the real concern?

38
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,593
Well, we do occasionally need
ready access to our money.

39
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,538
Honestly, guys,
I'd recommend the life insurance trust.

40
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:38,077
That, coupled with a growth- oriented
reallocation of your assets.

41
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,977
Including an assortment
of other investment vehicles.

42
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,771
What, like classic cars?

43
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,079
No, stocks, bonds.

44
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,119
I think he's pulling your leg, Brian.

45
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,316
Gotta remember that one.

46
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:54,352
So, great, we'll open an account,
get the paperwork started.

47
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:57,260
Brian, look, no offense.

48
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:00,924
I know we're family,
but let me think about it.

49
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,128
Run it by my accountant.

50
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,430
Ginsberg? He's a CPA,
he's not an investment advisor.

51
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,906
Whatever, he knows about this stuff.

52
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,972
You know what, Carm?
Talk to your accountant. Two heads.

53
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,011
Dad, it's Uncle Sil!

54
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,447
I gotta get that. Say hello to Janelle.

55
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,384
I'll walk you out, Bri.

56
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:26,218
Hang it up, A. J.!

57
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:33,122
What happened?

58
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:51,710
- Hey.
- Hey yourself.

59
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:53,910
What the fuck, John?

60
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,049
I got nothing to say.

61
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,552
You got nothing to say?

62
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,591
That fucking kid is in intensive care.

63
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,553
I thought he worked for Ralph.

64
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:05,224
And Ralph works for me.
So, I ask you again, what the fuck?

65
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,766
Let it suffice that I know
and Carmine knows...

66
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,234
that foppy cocksucker's holding out on us.

67
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,762
Fernandez Paving,
Ralph's contracting company.

68
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,832
My guy read the receipts
for the waterproofing at the Esplanade.

69
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:19,537
This fucking Ralph's
more creative than Spielberg.

70
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:22,975
He's off almost $4, 000,
third time in a row now.

71
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:26,107
We agreed, no looting the job site.

72
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,448
First of all, that hasn't been established.

73
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,013
Second of all, this is how you handle it?

74
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:35,660
Consider it a message.

75
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,424
He's in Miami.
They got phones there, last time I checked.

76
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,522
He's got a bad history, Tony.

77
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,625
Cute cocksucker could wind up dead.

78
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,163
What are you saying here?

79
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,279
He's a two- faced fucking prick.

80
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,340
- I thought Ralph was your friend.
- Right, that's rich.

81
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,043
Did you hear what my "friend"
said about my wife?

82
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,416
He made a crack about Ginny's weight.

83
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:07,391
Something about her having
a 90- pound mole on her ass.

84
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,792
Well, that's....

85
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,797
That's deplorable.

86
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,566
Who told you this?

87
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:23,569
- What's important is that it was said.
- lf he did say it, I didn't hear it.

88
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:27,010
'Cause he knows better than to make
a remark like that when I'm around.

89
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,946
She's fighting a weight problem
since the kids were born.

90
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:34,680
Weight Watchers, Richard Simmons, fasting.

91
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,788
- She works very fucking hard.
- You're telling me how hard it is?

92
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,827
It's different for women.
Body image, self- esteem.

93
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,995
I'll tell you, though.

94
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,695
I never had a problem with Ginny's weight.

95
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,866
To me, she's beautiful.

96
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:56,974
Rubenesque.

97
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,976
That woman is my life.

98
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,216
To think she's being mocked....

99
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,317
All right, look, John...

100
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:13,590
I'm not gonna sit here and deny
that Ralph can be a fucking asshole.

101
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,094
And that was a horrible thing to say.

102
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,791
But even if it was said, you can't be serious
about him winding up...

103
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:23,959
you know.

104
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,129
She's the mother of my children.

105
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,105
I know she is, John.

106
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,043
At least hear Ralph out.

107
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,241
How long we go back?

108
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,312
All of us?

109
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,448
The kid last night....

110
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,118
He was laughing.

111
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,153
About this?

112
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,290
I don't know.

113
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,527
All right. You're right.

114
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,858
It's just been sticking in my craw.

115
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,497
So, this kid gonna be okay?

116
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,533
I don't know, he's still unconscious.

117
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,603
My fucking temper.

118
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,903
Is he married, children, anything?

119
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,537
Lives with his mother.

120
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,111
I'll send her something nice.

121
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:26,563
I'm surprised he didn't call you.
Who knows? Maybe he'll be right back.

122
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,394
One sugar, right?

123
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,873
So, how are things at Casa Del Furio?

124
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,282
The Pakistani, the neighbor.

125
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,651
I want to make my garage into
the guesthouse so my parents can visit.

126
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:51,219
He says to me, because of the rules,
I cannot do it.

127
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,388
Right, the zoning.

128
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,950
The man who sells me the house,
he says nothing.

129
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,957
As far as I remember...

130
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,629
once title has passed,
you have no legal recourse.

131
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:04,630
Anyway...

132
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,069
next week,
I make a party for the housewarm.

133
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:09,934
What a nice idea.

134
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,172
This is my real estate exam.

135
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,077
There's one more prep course I want to take.

136
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:22,043
So, next Sunday is the party.

137
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:24,115
We will be there.

138
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,059
Now, here, you see?

139
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:32,287
"Except in cases of demonstrable fraud...

140
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:37,267
"transfer of title is binding once the grantee
registers the deed with the county clerk."

141
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:43,465
Some people say
college only serves to show grad schools...

142
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:46,136
who managed to show up
somewhere four years in a row.

143
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:49,875
But volunteering at the law center
actually allows you to make a difference.

144
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,077
Last year, with our help...

145
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:55,950
over a half a dozen crack babies
were reunited with their natural mothers...

146
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,988
several of whom are now in recovery.

147
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,782
Eventually, with the help
of ACLU attorneys...

148
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,886
you'll be filing court papers
and helping with legal research.

149
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:08,200
There's a sign- up sheet
and some fliers if you're interested. Thanks.

150
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:15,801
That's so true what you said about college
being an audition for grad school.

151
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,673
So much for higher learning.
Living in the moment?

152
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,874
Check out the law center.
There's some really cool people there.

153
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,889
There were 15 guys at the dinner
when Ralph told that joke.

154
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:36,557
- Could be anybody flapping their gums.
- What I don't get is why.

155
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:39,262
What's the upside of telling Johnny that?

156
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:42,858
- Get in good with New York somehow.
- Loose lips sink ships.

157
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:46,769
First, John knows about flipping the
property by the Esplanade, now this shit.

158
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,200
How about Patsy?

159
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,970
He's had issues,
maybe he's holding a grudge.

160
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,144
You really think he's that cagey?

161
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,479
- Albert, then.
- Wait a minute.

162
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,077
What if Vesuvio's bugged
and the fucking feds told Johnny?

163
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,380
- Conspiracy theories now?
- Why not?

164
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,258
Create a little dysentery among the ranks?

165
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,721
First of all, the place is swept once a week.

166
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:13,629
As for the feds, there's more interesting shit
being talked about in there...

167
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,428
besides Ginny's fat ass.

168
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,063
Sil? The liquor inspector's here.

169
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:34,976
What do you think?

170
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:40,086
- It's not possible, right?
- Silvio talking to Johnny?

171
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,788
You never know, T.

172
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,470
Jason's always been
a well- adjusted young man.

173
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,570
So why now, Elliot?

174
00:12:56,809 --> 00:13:01,371
Three years at Bard and
suddenly now as a senior, this epic drift?

175
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,471
No focus, no drive.

176
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:08,415
He's actually talked about dropping out
and joining the forestry service.

177
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,548
Well, some people thrive on solitude.

178
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,659
Senior year.

179
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:20,756
There's something about the light at the end
of that tunnel that can be very frightening.

180
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,727
Saskia's a senior.
Is she going through any of this?

181
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:27,769
Sask has always been highly motivated.
Kenahora.

182
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,965
Where's Richard in all this anyway?

183
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,705
Jason barely speaks to him anymore.

184
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,972
- Since when?
- Right after the rape.

185
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,716
Jason may be feeling guilty himself, Jen.

186
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,420
He's powerless to avenge you...

187
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,855
and resents his father
for the same shortcomings.

188
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:55,228
Hey, George Hamilton.

189
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,394
How's the back?

190
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:01,505
Oh, the masseuse down there, the Del Ray?

191
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,939
Magic fucking fingers.

192
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,944
- Tony call?
- On his way.

193
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,077
- He know you broke up with his sister?
- No, no.

194
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,878
Not unless she told him.

195
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:15,349
- You know what that crazy bitch was into?
- What?

196
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:18,447
She wanted to stick a dildo up my ass...

197
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,724
make believe she was pimping me out.

198
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,157
I told her,"Get the fuck out of here!"

199
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,554
- What the fuck?
- The whole family's nuts.

200
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,702
How are you?

201
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,375
How you doing?

202
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:43,438
Fellas, take this shit to my house.
Open some windows, air the place out.

203
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,344
For you, Florida's finest.

204
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,817
Thanks.

205
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,218
How's Donny K.?

206
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,196
I was just asking them about that.

207
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,828
I gotta get over there, get the full report.

208
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:05,528
Any idea who's writing
the family gossip column?

209
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:08,004
You know, funny thing about that...

210
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,032
I don't remember saying
anything about Ginny.

211
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,601
Come on, Ralph. I was sitting right there.

212
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,815
Then maybe I said something. I forget.
There was a lot of wine that night.

213
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:20,249
What about the land deal,
Frelinghuysen Avenue?

214
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:24,221
You forget, and maybe tell him that you,
me and Zellman made all that money?

215
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,258
Did I tell him about it? No.

216
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,691
But I sure as shit ended up paying for it.

217
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,924
When you think about it,
Johnny's got some balls.

218
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:35,091
Big house, lining his pocket
with our hard- earned cash?

219
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,334
Who's he think's keeping that fat bitch
in Devil Dogs anyway?

220
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,838
Whatever he is,
he's also Carmine's underboss...

221
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,874
so you're gonna fucking placate him.

222
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,707
Oh, what, apologize?

223
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,971
No, you do that, it'll be worse.

224
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:53,245
Whoever told him this,
it's your word against theirs.

225
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,719
You're highly fucking outraged.

226
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,130
Hello, sweetie. It's your secret admirer.

227
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,188
Is he there?

228
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,791
Oh hi, Ralph, one sec.

229
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,328
John, Ralph Cifaretto!

230
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,244
- I'll take it in there.
- Okay, hon.

231
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,848
- John, it's me.
- And?

232
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:28,753
And I'm calling to tell you
how appalled I am.

233
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,982
I just got back, I talked to Tony.

234
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:33,547
I love Ginny,
I would never say anything like that.

235
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,115
That's not what I heard.

236
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,421
From who, John?

237
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,158
I don't betray confidences.
Are you denying you said it?

238
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:42,200
Fuck, yes, I'm denying I said it.

239
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,407
I don't believe you.

240
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:53,104
Just tell me who said this,
I'll put a bullet in their fucking eye!

241
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,043
You're a real weasel, you know that?

242
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:01,419
John, please.

243
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:06,084
Look, last year, when Tony and I had
our thing, that misunderstanding...

244
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,620
you were the voice of reason.

245
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:12,259
You were the one that told me to apologize.

246
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,299
So, you're apologizing?

247
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,532
If that's what it takes.

248
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:20,071
Why would you? I thought you didn't say it.

249
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:22,502
- I didn't say it.
- You know something, Ralph?

250
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:25,543
Not only are you a thief,
you're a lying fucking prick.

251
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:28,876
I should've let Tony
chop your head off a year ago.

252
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,187
What did I say? No apology!

253
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,126
I want you to sanction a hit
on Ralph Cifaretto.

254
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,459
What, are you fucking kidding me?

255
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,264
He violated my wife's honor.

256
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,735
Ralph slept with Ginny?

257
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,966
He insulted her.

258
00:17:56,041 --> 00:18:00,375
He made a very insensitive joke about
her body to some friends of ours.

259
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,505
- What did he say?
- I have to repeat it?

260
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:05,845
- My word's not good enough?
- Not if you want him clipped over it.

261
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,011
He said...

262
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,518
she was having a 90- pound mole
removed from her ass.

263
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,258
The implication was, her ass is so big...

264
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,930
she could have a mole
that size removed from it.

265
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,700
It's an off- color remark,
it was highly inappropriate.

266
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,677
If you want, I'll demand he's taxed.

267
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,071
But clip him?

268
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:40,777
Is it all just about money?

269
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,750
I'll crack him good.

270
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:46,723
- I'll ask for $200, 000.
- $200, 000 for insulting my wife?

271
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,352
What's next, Carmine,
he get to fuck her for $1 million?

272
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,486
He wants to fuck her?

273
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:53,827
I'm making a point,
I'm talking about my wife's honor here!

274
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,526
My honor!

275
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:09,145
We depend on this guy.
There are millions of dollars at stake.

276
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,882
We can't afford it, John.

277
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,541
A roomful of guys making fun of my wife...

278
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,918
and you're not gonna let me deal with this?

279
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:20,421
Not that way. My answer's gotta be no.

280
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:29,029
I want a sit- down then,
with Ralph the fucking thief.

281
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:33,002
Get this Fernandez Paving
bullshit dealt with.

282
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:49,678
He was accused of a crime
of severe immorality.

283
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,546
They actually beat him for it with sticks.

284
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:56,984
The truth was he had a photograph
of Britney Spears with his belongings.

285
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:58,961
That's horrible.

286
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,793
Dad?

287
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,636
Thought I was in the wrong place.

288
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,042
What are you doing here?

289
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:15,272
I was looking for a glass of milk
to dunk these in...

290
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,508
and I thought maybe you could help me out.

291
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,720
Got a meeting in the city later.

292
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:26,556
- Rahimah, this is my dad.
- How you doing?

293
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,388
- Hello.
- Want a donut?

294
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:29,858
No, thanks.

295
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,594
- I'll see you later, Meadow.
- Okay.

296
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:52,409
So, what's this your mother tells me
about you joining the legal aid society?

297
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:57,044
South Bronx Law Center. I'm volunteering.

298
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:01,422
They provide free legal counsel
for the indigent and disenfranchised.

299
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,060
And this Rahoomi, she's what,
your first client?

300
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,260
What happened to being a pediatrician?

301
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,562
I thought that was a great field for you,
the way you love kids.

302
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:15,935
Nothing happened to it.
I can't explore some career options?

303
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:18,238
Oh, defending farebeaters is a career?

304
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,108
Is that why you came here, to annoy me?

305
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,744
Hey, you wanna help people, that's fine.

306
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,550
That's very noble.

307
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,449
Really, I mean it.

308
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:33,248
Just don't be a sucker, okay?
A lot of these indigenous types...

309
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:37,352
they got plenty of money to smoke crack
and gamble and all that shit.

310
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,556
You ought to know.

311
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,090
Oh, I see.

312
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,798
That's what this is?

313
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,567
You're working with minorities now,
to get back at me for being mean to Noel.

314
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,603
God, listen to you.

315
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:55,010
Believe it or not,
the world doesn't revolve around you.

316
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,222
Come on, let's go to the bookstore.

317
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,956
You probably need a sweatshirt
or something.

318
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:40,989
Hey, take it easy!

319
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:08,315
How was the traffic?

320
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:10,683
Tunnel was a little backed up.

321
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:13,390
This time of day, G. W. , you zip right over.

322
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,888
All right, let's straighten this out.

323
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:26,260
I talked to the guy over at Fernandez Paving,
the accountant.

324
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:30,106
Fernandez has been
using this jerk for years.

325
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:32,609
Anyway, it turns out you're right.

326
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,146
The guy's been adding 50 gallons
of sealant every 1, 000 yards.

327
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:38,273
Excuse me, I can't do this.

328
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,840
- What?
- What's wrong?

329
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,045
I can't listen to this bullshit.

330
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:45,453
- I'm trying to explain.
- Fuck you!

331
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,515
- John, please.
- Don't fucking "John" me!

332
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,459
- Hey, we're trying to settle this.
- It's not about that.

333
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,661
I'm sorry, Carmine.
I can't be in the same room with this man.

334
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:09,176
Have you talked to Jason La Penna lately?

335
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:10,908
Actually, I try not to.

336
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:14,951
When I came out, he acted all weird.
I can't believe I actually kissed him once.

337
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,085
His mother tells me
he's having a rough time of it.

338
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:21,125
Jen? Please, I'm sure she's overreacting.

339
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,518
Apparently, he's talked about dropping out.

340
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:27,326
He's okay, but Jason
is like the clichéd psychiatrist's kid.

341
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:30,960
Slightest bump in the road, he knows
exactly what to say to get attention.

342
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,942
- There any of that crumb cake left?
- Counter.

343
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,648
What's all that?

344
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,621
I'm consolidating some bills.

345
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:04,527
Maybe you don't care about our future,
Tony, but I do.

346
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,332
Where do you get that I don't care?

347
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:09,168
- I met with your cousin.
- Yeah, you met with Brian.

348
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:11,641
You sat there eating cake
and making wisecracks.

349
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,575
It's boring to me, okay?

350
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:22,218
You gonna cry now?

351
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:29,556
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- When you ignore me, Tony...

352
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:32,153
when you trivialize things
that are important to me...

353
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:36,030
like this family's financial security,
it makes me feel unloved.

354
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:39,995
That's your problem right there,
because you equate love with money!

355
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:42,198
You equate love with money!

356
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:05,194
- Is it safe?
- We each got a new cell phone.

357
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:08,255
Talk on it once, you toss it.
Totally untraceable.

358
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,365
It's what the Taliban used to do.

359
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,495
Let's get started.

360
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,165
My daughter- in- law's coming here
with the baby later.

361
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,546
- Hello?
- Is he there?

362
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,345
Yeah, Ton'.

363
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:25,281
Okay, you're all set.

364
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,545
- Just talk into there.
- Junior?

365
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,052
Who's that? Tony?

366
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:32,419
Junior, it's Carmine. How you doing?

367
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,084
I'm going to the poorhouse,
that's how I'm doing.

368
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,320
When you had that RICO trial,
what'd that run you?

369
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:40,992
- A lot.
- Where you going?

370
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:43,500
I told you, I gotta pick up Sophia.

371
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,273
Junior, can we do this already?

372
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,203
Yeah, right.

373
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:56,337
Johnny and Ralph Cifaretto, right?

374
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:59,144
- Ralph insulted John's wife?
- That's correct.

375
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:01,777
- Who's on the wire now?
- It's John, Corrado.

376
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:06,680
So, what did Ralph do exactly?

377
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:09,488
He made a very hurtful remark,
it's not worth repeating.

378
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:12,655
It's not important.
Let's just agree it was unkind.

379
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:14,961
Let's point out, too...

380
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:17,160
that it's only been alleged
something was said.

381
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:21,865
He "allegedly" said what he said
to a group of people, friends of ours.

382
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,335
If you weren't there,
how do you know it's true?

383
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:28,072
- I'm not at liberty to say.
- All due respect, but this is bullshit.

384
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,307
Somebody in my family's
talking out of school...

385
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:33,874
and you're not at liberty to say who?
I should be making the beef here.

386
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:35,476
My nephew's right.

387
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:39,512
Let's stick to the issue.
A horrible insult was made against Ginny.

388
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:42,424
- End of fucking story.
- What does he want done about it?

389
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,258
I want to avenge her honor,
as is my right to do.

390
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,820
All right, fine.

391
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:50,058
You tell me who told you about it,
we'll bring him in here.

392
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:53,798
He corroborates what you're saying,
I'll give you Ralph on a platter.

393
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:00,611
Is nothing sacred?

394
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,204
I mean, this is my wife
we're talking about here.

395
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:06,282
If this were years ago,
would I even have had to ask?

396
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:09,947
I mean, what happened to this thing?

397
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:13,513
For God's sake, we bend more rules
than the Catholic Church.

398
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:15,058
All right, look.

399
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:17,594
Let's assume, for the sake of argument...

400
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:19,994
Ralph said what you think he said.

401
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:24,264
- Is clipping him gonna unring that bell?
- Nobody's getting clipped.

402
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:25,927
I want satisfaction.

403
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:29,269
- Will you accept an apology?
- That ship has sailed.

404
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:30,941
You're being unreasonable.

405
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,773
Ralph Cifaretto's the only one
who can handle the Esplanade?

406
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:36,939
- Put Pontecorvo in there.
- There are millions of dollars at stake.

407
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:39,882
- Again with the money?
- Yeah, again with the money.

408
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,612
It's settled, John.

409
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:44,519
So either name a price,
or get the fuck over it.

410
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:06,137
What would you say
to a piece of Ralph's company?

411
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:10,381
Just think about it at least.

412
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:11,541
Just think about it at least.

413
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:28,456
Hello?

414
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:31,261
It's me. What, are you still asleep?

415
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:34,700
No, I was doing something.

416
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,836
I took John to dinner last night.

417
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,073
Ralph's got a big problem, kid.

418
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:41,578
- I thought you squashed it.
- I did.

419
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:43,772
Problem is,
I don't know if John's hearing me.

420
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:46,373
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Me?

421
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,713
Nothing.

422
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:50,753
- What does that mean?
- I didn't say nothing.

423
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:54,051
We share the Esplanade, Tony.

424
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:56,057
I don't want that apple cart upset.

425
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,322
Then somebody
should do something about it.

426
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:00,193
I appreciate your thoughts.

427
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:08,566
- You saying what I think you're saying?
- I didn't say nothing.

428
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:15,144
All right then, I'll talk to you.

429
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:23,982
Twenty years, I've been friends with John.
Now he's gotta go.

430
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,122
All over a stupid joke.

431
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:39,869
I was fucking around. For Christ's sakes!

432
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:42,969
You've never made a joke
about Ginny Sack?

433
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,633
- Not like that.
- Of course not.

434
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,973
Fuck him and his highfalutin bullshit.

435
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:49,275
Who does he think he is, Sir Walter Raleigh?

436
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:52,248
That's enough of you
and your stupid fucking remarks!

437
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:56,117
Go back to Miami and play volleyball,
whatever the fuck you do down there...

438
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,587
while we clean up your fucking mess!

439
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,088
Maybe even keep your ass alive.

440
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:15,933
A mole on her ass?

441
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:18,909
What's the joke? I still don't get it.

442
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:21,275
It's not a joke, per se, it's....

443
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,841
You had to be there.

444
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,613
Real lack of standards, your generation.

445
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,146
My day, John was right.

446
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,916
A man wouldn't be expected
to stand for such a remark.

447
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,924
Fucked up thing is I don't even like Ralph.

448
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,722
If he was drowning,
I'd throw him a cinderblock.

449
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:39,490
But not protect one of my own captains?

450
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:43,596
Besides, it's too late anyway.

451
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:47,300
- Carmine gave me the nod.
- On Johnny?

452
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:51,968
That one's a slippery fuck.

453
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,534
Him and those big fish- lips of his.

454
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:57,981
Look at this.

455
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,742
The fifth question
and the poor prick used all his lifelines.

456
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:10,023
John goes...

457
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:14,192
Carmine's gonna position himself
for maximum deniability.

458
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:18,259
So you make it easy for everybody,
take it out of the neighborhood.

459
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:21,066
- What, like an accident?
- Accident, stickup.

460
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:23,972
He could choke on a chicken wing.

461
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:27,038
The important thing, Johnny disappears.

462
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:30,579
With Johnny out,
Carmine's gonna put his son in there.

463
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:32,445
Fucking Brainless ll.

464
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,653
Who knows?
Maybe there's an upside to Johnny going.

465
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:45,863
He goes to Boston a lot, to visit his father.

466
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:48,792
Could happen up there.

467
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:53,799
You want my advice?
You'll call Lou Dimaggio.

468
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:56,633
The Atwell Avenue boys.

469
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,506
What, those sick old fucks in Rhode Island?

470
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:03,138
They may be old, my little nephew,
but those dogs can still hunt.

471
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:06,448
My old man used to talk about them...

472
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:09,082
something to do with drugs.

473
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:10,447
Heroin.

474
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:14,621
Back in the'50s,
it was raining cash with that shit.

475
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:17,752
Dimaggio and his crew never saw a dime.

476
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:22,164
The guy they worked for, Lenny Caputo,
he didn't believe in it.

477
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:24,892
For 15 years...

478
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:28,097
everyone and their mother
was getting rich dealing H.

479
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:31,166
Everyone except these guys.

480
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:35,410
They're eking a living doing hits,
running swag.

481
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:39,348
Anyway, lo and behold, one day...

482
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:42,809
Lenny gets pinched for heroin trafficking.

483
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:47,480
It turns out
the cocksucker's been making a fortune...

484
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:50,425
working with the mulignon,
and not only that...

485
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:53,362
he's been selling out his own guys
to the feds...

486
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:56,229
so he can keep his ass out on the street.

487
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:00,326
Dimaggio and another guy in his crew
did eight years on a murder rap.

488
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,535
So much for loyalty.

489
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:06,735
You go to Rhode Island,
and whatever you do, don't mention drugs.

490
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:08,802
Coke, heroin, not even Tylenol.

491
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,440
So, what happened to this Lenny prick?

492
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:18,111
Lou Dimaggio. His real name is Galina.

493
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:22,115
They called him Dimaggio
when Lenny and his wife were found...

494
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,593
with their heads bashed in
by a baseball bat.

495
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:29,796
Anyway, that was Lou,
while he still had his health.

496
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,979
We could do this ourselves. Ninja style.

497
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:47,011
Father?

498
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:50,587
We're here to see Lou Dimaggio.

499
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:53,019
Come in.

500
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:30,551
Hello. Silvio Dante, we spoke on the phone.

501
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:36,331
Chris Moltisanti, how you doing?

502
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:38,796
- My name's Chris, too.
- Yeah?

503
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:40,901
- Are you into drugs?
- What?

504
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:44,897
No.

505
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,677
- What do you mean?
- We don't work for drug dealers.

506
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:50,111
- No.
- Of course not.

507
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:53,440
- Want some coffee?
- No thanks.

508
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:54,744
Rose?

509
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,185
- Yeah, Pop?
- More Sanka.

510
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:03,189
Anyway, this is him.

511
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,462
John Sacrimoni.

512
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:13,860
He'll be coming up through here,
next few days.

513
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:17,097
He stays at the Boston Harbor Hotel.

514
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:20,039
The guy on the left.

515
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:22,970
It's my birthday, too.

516
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,743
We're having cake later. Carvel.

517
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:39,727
Chromosomes. Runs in the family.

518
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:43,532
There was a guy once, Tommy Neri.

519
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:47,337
Got him coming home
from the track one night.

520
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:49,871
Caught him good with a tire iron.

521
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,702
When he woke up, I held him down...

522
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:55,610
while Frank cut his head off with a hacksaw.

523
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:58,338
Silent as a mouse pissing on cotton.

524
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:00,782
If you like...

525
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:04,246
we could arrange
to have that same thing happen again.

526
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:09,752
I don't know
that we need to be that overstated.

527
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:12,028
What did you have in mind, then?

528
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:14,826
Nothing fancy, as long as he disappears.

529
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:16,524
It's your money.

530
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:23,172
Yeah, about that. $20, 000, we said.

531
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:24,940
Half up- front.

532
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:36,278
So, we'll call you, then?

533
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,884
Pop, Father's here.

534
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,586
Would you like some cake?

535
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:50,191
Actually, we got a long ride back.

536
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:03,242
Have you seen my sweater, the cable- knit?

537
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:04,542
The white one?

538
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:07,047
It shrunk, I put it in the bag for Goodwill.

539
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,348
I told you I was gonna bring it up to Dad.

540
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,389
I'm sorry. It's in the basement,
near the card table.

541
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:18,519
- Hello?
- It's me.

542
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:22,198
I just hung up with the guy,
Jerry, from Fort Lauderdale.

543
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:25,326
That guy we're looking for,
he's at the Del Ray Hotel in Miami.

544
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,371
Our friend with the paving problem.

545
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:30,769
Send someone over there tomorrow
to take care of it then.

546
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:32,638
Are you sure you want to do this?

547
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,270
I'd feel a lot better with the Pope's blessing.

548
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:36,643
Just do as you're told.

549
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,579
I'll deal with the fallout.

550
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:42,209
Who was that, hon?

551
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:44,213
Nobody.

552
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:46,956
Plumber for the store.

553
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,123
- What's that you're making?
- Fruit salad. You want some?

554
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:51,889
Low- fat whipped cream.

555
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:54,430
No. You enjoy it, sweetie.

556
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:26,290
Why did I have to come?
He's not even home.

557
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:29,827
Look who's here.
Carmela, Anthony, how you doing?

558
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:32,797
We were just passing by,
I figured we'd give it a shot.

559
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,168
- No, we weren't.
- Come, I show you.

560
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:43,879
I was working in the yard, clear the weeds.

561
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:47,340
Next year, I'll grow grapes
for the Falanghina.

562
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:50,486
Gonna make my own wine.

563
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:53,051
It's gorgeous, Fur'.

564
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:56,691
So, that's the garage in question.
Anthony, don't wander off.

565
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:59,025
- But I have to go to the bathroom.
- Just stay put.

566
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:01,326
We're leaving in five minutes.

567
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:05,233
You're thinking of making that
an apartment for your parents?

568
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:07,202
A garage, I don't need it.

569
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:14,270
One time, back in Naples...

570
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:18,740
I work in the garden
as a landscaper for a very rich man.

571
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:23,175
Just me, I work there alone, growing olives.

572
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:27,687
My hands in the dirt...the hot sun.

573
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:35,495
I was never so happy in my life
as when I work at that place.

574
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:40,264
Sometimes, I get the smell of olives...

575
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:42,901
in a restaurant, in the store maybe.

576
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:48,641
It makes me very sad.

577
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:06,829
You know, I'm not sure,
but I think if it was built before 1938...

578
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:09,092
you can apply for a zoning variance.

579
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:12,863
"Pre- existing, non- conforming structure,"
I think it's called.

580
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:22,674
I just got it back from the Martinizing.

581
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,644
They do a nice job over there.

582
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:27,841
Say hi to Dad for me.

583
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:31,354
I put Allegra's graduation picture
in a frame for him.

584
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,652
- Love you.
- I love you, too.

585
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:36,049
Careful driving.

586
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,108
Shit.

587
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,287
It's me.

588
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:45,484
Hello?

589
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,032
Why is the door unlocked?

590
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:12,017
Jesus, you scared the shit out of me.

591
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,216
- What are you doing?
- I thought you left.

592
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:16,088
I forgot the sweater.

593
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,755
- What are you doing on the floor?
- Nothing.

594
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:20,990
I was getting the laundry together.

595
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:36,871
What the hell's this?
I thought you're on the Atkins.

596
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,745
I was! I am! It's hard, John! I'm trying!

597
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,849
This is how you try?

598
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:47,853
I'm not out of the house 10 minutes!

599
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:50,120
I was dizzy, I was having low blood sugar.

600
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:51,752
What happened to the fruit salad?

601
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:53,922
You were supposed to quit smoking
and didn't!

602
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:55,795
Nicotine's an addictive substance!

603
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:58,164
What's wrong with you?
Why are you yelling at me?

604
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:01,671
Did I ever ask you to go on a diet?
Did I ask you to be thin for me?

605
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:05,732
The fasting, the NutriSystems,
those goddamn Deal- A- Meal cards?

606
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:08,804
It's the world, John. Our culture.

607
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:11,871
Fuck that!
Do you have any idea what you've done?

608
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:16,084
- What do you mean?
- You lied to me! You lied!

609
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:20,448
I know I've gained weight
these last few years.

610
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:24,052
I see the other wives,
the way men look at them.

611
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:26,519
Don't I look at you like that?

612
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,625
Haven't I always?

613
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,769
It was your idea, all this dieting nonsense.

614
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:36,197
I want you to be proud of me.

615
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:38,373
I am proud of you.

616
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:42,638
I love you.

617
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:52,546
- Welcome to the Del Ray Hotel.
- Thank you.

618
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:54,284
Can I get your bags?

619
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:58,394
Go on into the lobby. I'll meet you inside.

620
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:17,471
Hello?

621
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:21,177
Listen, it's me. I just talked to my guy again,
we're calling it off.

622
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:23,784
I'm already out here, though.
Like right there.

623
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:26,948
We'll work something out, then.
Don't worry about it.

624
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:32,125
- I want half.
- All right, whatever.

625
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,295
Getting out?

626
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:35,854
No.

627
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:05,762
What's your fucking problem?

628
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,871
- I love the pine flooring.
- I know, it's so rustic.

629
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:38,023
This is pretty cool. It's actually from Italy.

630
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:40,760
I'm so bored, I feel like crying.

631
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:52,268
It's adorable, Furio, really.

632
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:56,477
- I'm gonna be leaving soon.
- Come on.

633
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,074
Stick around. Have some food.

634
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,611
Anything from our friends up north?

635
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:05,411
Carmine called. Johnny's still in town.

636
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,283
I'm not kidding.

637
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:11,191
There's tons of toys in there
he said you could have.

638
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:13,092
They're back behind those boxes.

639
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,597
Bullshit, you're gonna lock me in.

640
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:17,063
Okay, fine.

641
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:20,962
But don't say I didn't tell you.
He gets them from Italy.

642
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,700
His father owns a steamship company.

643
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:29,605
- Okay.
- Go ahead, I'll get the flashlight.

644
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:35,242
Help! Let me out of here!

645
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,348
Gabriella, come.

646
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,755
Come on, dance.

647
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:58,439
Silvio, you tell her, she can't wear
fancy shoes and no dance, come on.

648
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:01,534
- Shake it up a little.
- No.

649
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:06,705
- Come on, Dad, dance with me.
- No, thanks.

650
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:08,580
Tommy Tune over there.

651
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:16,349
Carmela. You come, too.

652
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:18,758
Yeah, Carm, go ahead, good idea.

653
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,794
You watch me, you do the same.
Everybody, come on.

654
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:35,109
Everybody, come on.

655
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:38,780
- That's it.
- God, I'm so bad.

656
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:40,813
No, you're good, come.

657
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:40,473
At least it's not just Jason who's regressing.

658
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:44,640
Soprano? His own daughter
was going through the same thing.

659
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:48,643
I felt like such a fraud giving him advice.

660
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:52,352
My own son
has three years on his daughter...

661
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:55,024
and look how he's acting.

662
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:00,395
Jen, why do you still feel guilty?

663
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,294
Sometimes I wonder...

664
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:05,730
if Richard had a point.

665
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:10,038
I shouldn't have gone down into that garage
that late at night.

666
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:15,578
I went to see Sask at school the other day...

667
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,371
and I'm in the parking garage over there.

668
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,343
I was driving around for 20 minutes...

669
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:24,376
when finally I spot someone leaving,
this big, Bluto sort of guy.

670
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:28,349
I must have crowded him
as he headed for his car.

671
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:30,791
Anyway, he turned around...

672
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:33,022
and became quite confrontational.

673
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:37,291
And for a second,
I'll admit, I thought of you.

674
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,964
What are you getting at?

675
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:44,940
Parking garages
are not inherently dangerous places.

676
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:49,237
You cannot blame yourself
for what happened to you.

677
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,574
Turns out this guy
was probably another parent...

678
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:56,448
or, more likely, a repairman.

679
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:00,320
But if he had dragged me out of my car
and beaten me up...

680
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:04,553
would I be saying,
"Gee, I shouldn't have tried to park my car?"

681
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:12,228
Anyway, enough about him.
Let's get back to you.

682
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:31,016
You wanted to see me?

683
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:34,524
You can tell Ralph
I've decided to accept his apology.

684
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:44,492
You know that kid you pissed on?
Donny K.?

685
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:48,066
He's got fucking nerve damage
on his left side.

686
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:50,664
I'm sorry, Tony.

687
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:55,701
I bet you are.

688
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,804
I'll expect to hear from Ralph, then.

689
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:03,449
Why the big reversal all of a sudden?

690
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:07,950
No more weight remarks, Tony.

691
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:11,217
They're hurtful, and they're destructive.

692
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:13,857
I agree.

693
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,360
Still awake?

694
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:49,324
I'm just reading.

695
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,764
Bought you something.

696
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:56,835
What's this for?

697
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,805
No reason.

698
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:01,740
I don't know if I believe that.

699
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:14,349
Put a call in to Ginsberg, by the way.

700
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:16,583
He's back from California.

701
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:23,432
Tony, this is beautiful.

702
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,060
What size is this?

703
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:30,834
I don't know, small.

704
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,867
I don't know if this'll fit.

705
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:36,310
Try it on.

706
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:06,642
See? I knew you could pull it off.

707
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:13,416
- You look like a model.
- Listen to him now.

708
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:18,904
I'm sorry, Tony.

709
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:21,740
- What's the matter?
- I can't, the music.

710
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:24,280
Meadow, turn it off!

711
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:28,215
What?

712
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:48,311
The music, will you turn it down, please?

713
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,286
I'm going out.
