1
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:39,363
It happens.

2
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,834
Massachusetts!

3
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:53,841
Listen to this shit.

4
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:57,314
"New Jersey Council of Indian Affairs
has announced plans...

5
00:01:57,383 --> 00:02:00,443
"to disrupt Monday's Columbus Day Parade
in Newark.

6
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,251
"Council Chairman, Del Redclay,
Professor of Cultural Anthropology..."

7
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,315
Stop blowing your nose, I want to hear this.

8
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:08,952
"...says council members and supporters
will lie down...

9
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:11,019
"in the path of Columbus Day marchers...

10
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:14,726
"'in protest of Columbus' role
in the genocide...

11
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,599
"'of America's native peoples. '

12
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:21,637
"To launch their protest, the
Native Americans and their sympathizers...

13
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,767
"plan to begin a deathwatch tomorrow...

14
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:27,244
"over the statue of Columbus
in Christopher Columbus Park."

15
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,942
Some fucking balls, bad- mouthing America,
especially now.

16
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,018
I thought that Columbus
was the hero of America.

17
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,817
See, it's these Indians
and the Commie fucks.

18
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,951
They wanna paint Columbus
as a slave trader instead of an explorer.

19
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:43,891
You gotta admit, they did get massacred,
the Indians.

20
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:46,693
We gave them
a bunch a shit to make up for that.

21
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,666
Land, reservations.

22
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:50,468
And now they got the casinos.

23
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:53,028
What the fuck we ever get
we didn't have to work for?

24
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,733
I wouldn't mind sitting all day...

25
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:57,674
smoking mushrooms
and collecting government checks.

26
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:03,178
You know what it is? I'll tell you what it is.

27
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,017
It's anti- Italian discrimination.

28
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:09,253
Columbus Day is a day of Italian pride.

29
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,282
It's our holiday,
and they wanna take it away.

30
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:14,824
Fuck them.

31
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:17,921
But I never liked Columbus.

32
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,826
In Napoli, a lot of people
are not so happy for Columbus...

33
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:25,564
- 'cause he was from Genova.
- What's the problem with Genova?

34
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:28,664
The North of Italy
always have the money and the power.

35
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:31,733
They punish the South
since hundreds of years.

36
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:35,178
Even today, they put up their nose at us,
like we're peasants.

37
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,948
I hate the North.

38
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:41,548
- Jesus, take it easy.
- I'm gonna take action, here.

39
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,327
Ro, gonna go to
the church luncheon tomorrow?

40
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,373
It's on the subject
of Italian- American women and pride.

41
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,875
- I guess'cause of Columbus Day.
- Who's the star?

42
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:07,538
- A woman professor from Montclair State.
- Father Phil says she's very good.

43
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,912
- You should come, Adriana.
- Me?

44
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,109
Yeah, come with us.

45
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,516
Noon in the bingo room
at Saint Peter and Paul's.

46
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,816
They have a series of ladies' luncheons
every week.

47
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,914
The food is good,
and the speakers have been fantastic.

48
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,788
Furio Giunta just bought himself
a little house in Nutley.

49
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:25,194
He is so gorgeous.

50
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,062
I'm surprised nobody snapped him up yet.

51
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,727
- I think he should lose the ponytail.
- You do?

52
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:32,794
- I think it looks great on him.
- That's his trademark.

53
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:36,308
Sandi Fortunato says
it looks like a dick coming out of his head.

54
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:39,743
And she pretends to be his friend.
What a two- face.

55
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,081
How much money did you make today, slut?

56
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,711
- $300.
- That's all, bitch?

57
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,549
I'm gonna put you back on the street.
Make you work that ass.

58
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:56,492
- Put me back on the street, baby, yeah.
- Work that ass, you little cunt.

59
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,521
Yeah, you work it, baby.

60
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,891
Mama's little tramp. Mama's little whore.

61
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,662
I'm gonna pimp you out, bitch.

62
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,536
I gotta get that.

63
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:14,735
Hello?

64
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,408
No. Hi, Ro, how are you?

65
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,211
What?

66
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,778
I can't hear you too good.

67
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,656
It must be your cell phone. You in the car?

68
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:27,955
No, I'm coming home.

69
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,383
Yeah.

70
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,492
No, chicken's great.

71
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:36,562
No. Yeah. Me, too.

72
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:37,892
Bye.

73
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,667
God, we're so naughty.

74
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:51,308
- How can we do this with Ro on the phone?
- What?

75
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:55,886
We're so wacky.

76
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,221
No regard for nothing.

77
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,763
- Operator.
- Yeah, I'd like to make a collect call.

78
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,829
Area code 917.

79
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,702
Speak.

80
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:20,272
Collect call from Mr. Walters.

81
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,741
Okay, I'll take it, operator.

82
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,450
- How you doing?
- You know.

83
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,152
Thanks for the stamps. How you getting on?

84
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,586
I feel old.

85
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,021
Listen, John...

86
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,820
I just want to say...

87
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:39,490
I hope your feelings weren't hurt too bad,
and that it never got back to the missus.

88
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,762
- The fuck you talking about?
- You didn't hear the joke about Ginny?

89
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:46,297
Never mind. Let it die a death.

90
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:47,904
What joke?

91
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,771
You're better off not hearing it. Trust me.

92
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,674
Fuck that! I demand you tell me, Paulie!

93
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:58,639
John, you got more laborers on that job site
than we got carpenters.

94
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,345
What's the problem?

95
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:03,581
The carpenters
are carrying sheetrock and materials.

96
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:06,955
- We ain't getting what we expected to get.
- Minimally expected.

97
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:09,119
Let Massarone hire more laborers
off the books.

98
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,662
Nobody's talking to you!

99
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:13,291
All right, Jesus.

100
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,640
65:35.

101
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,873
Johnny, you explain the other thing
I want to talk about.

102
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:27,935
Sure.

103
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,071
Tony, we've discovered
you bought property...

104
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:33,778
around Frelinghuysen Avenue
and turned it in a week.

105
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:34,875
So?

106
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:38,184
You did it with inside knowledge
from Ron Zellman.

107
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,417
Got your attention from where?

108
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:44,088
That property's hot
because of the Esplanade.

109
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,893
We share the Esplanade. We share Zellman.

110
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,564
If the Soprano family's gonna benefit
from a thing, Carmine feels we should, too.

111
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:00,941
Okay, we'll work something out.

112
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:10,148
I've been your doctor for 30 years,
you still hate the thermometer.

113
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,324
Tony, Furio's here!

114
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,656
Thank you for bringing those strufoli.
I love those.

115
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:20,760
Here's a few long- term bonds
that I find attractive.

116
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,030
Wouldn't it be great if the person
you trust most was your broker?

117
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:25,536
Let's look at your allocations.

118
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:29,473
At Schwab, we give advice
that's not driven by commission.

119
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,975
Call 1- 800- 7- SCHWAB...

120
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:34,103
to set up a consultation
to check the health of your portfolio.

121
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,148
And lay off the junk bonds.

122
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:43,019
- I got pictures of my new house.
- Let me see.

123
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,088
Welcome back.
We're here today with our guests...

124
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,153
Dr. Del Redclay, who's a professor
of anthropology at Rutgers University...

125
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,825
and spokesman
for the anti- Columbus protest.

126
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:55,925
My God.

127
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,526
And also Mr. Phillip L. Di Notti...

128
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,400
It's lovely.

129
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:02,999
...a coalition of Italian- American
anti- defamation organizations.

130
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:05,165
Okay.

131
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,377
- This thing gets on my nerves.
- Don't get me started.

132
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:14,249
Well, let's start with the idea
of a parade for a genocidal colonial general.

133
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,288
A national holiday, no less.

134
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:20,155
- Such festivities are deeply offensive to us.
- These are pretty broad charges.

135
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:24,595
All I know is Italian Americans are
extremely proud of Christopher Columbus...

136
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:27,189
admiral of the ocean seas,
and a great Italian.

137
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:30,030
You know very well
of the compromised position we put forth.

138
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:33,503
Now, if you people wanna make it
an Italian pride parade...

139
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,870
we have no problem with that.

140
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,273
Western history
says Columbus discovered America.

141
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:40,710
The same America that put your people
in bondage for three centuries.

142
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,305
But every culture has had to bear the pain...

143
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:48,217
in the making of what I think we can
all agree is a startling economic miracle.

144
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,983
- We cured polio.
- I have to agree with Phil.

145
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,615
- The right to vote.
- Exactly.

146
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,319
Take my grandparents.

147
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,327
Two simple people from Sicily...

148
00:09:56,395 --> 00:10:00,092
- who braved the perilous middle passage--
- Middle passage?

149
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,600
That's the term for the slave trade.

150
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:06,032
Montel, the Italian people in this country...

151
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,539
also have suffered discrimination.

152
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:13,211
Earth to Phil.
We're talking 300 years of slavery, here.

153
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:16,870
Enough.

154
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:26,349
You okay, Tony?
You look a little muscia- moosh.

155
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,918
Uncle Jun's trial starts today.

156
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:35,360
- First Soprano family trial in 16 years.
- We should go.

157
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,735
The guys are gonna be at the other place.

158
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,930
Thank you for the cookies.

159
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,110
And congratulations on that house.

160
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,074
And I like the kitchen.

161
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,173
Take a strufoli.

162
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:00,456
Be seated.

163
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,453
Next case on the calendar...

164
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:08,159
United States of America
versus Corrado John Soprano et al.

165
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,532
Any applications before I bring in the jury?

166
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,366
No, your honor.

167
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,430
- Bring the jury.
- Telephone charges on your last bill?

168
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,806
Cost me $40
every time you pick up the phone.

169
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,003
I can't....

170
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,886
$2, 380, last month alone.

171
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:30,444
I'm going to give you
some preliminary instructions...

172
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,981
and explain the process
by which we will try this case.

173
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,394
The first order of business....

174
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:40,656
Looking out at this audience
of proud, strong, beautiful women...

175
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:44,259
how far we have come
in this American journey.

176
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,799
Look how we've both
preserved the tradition of our ancestors...

177
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:53,504
and managed to become
new Italian- American women.

178
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:57,445
Such flair we have added to our image.

179
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,948
And yet, America still sees us...

180
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,787
as pizza makers and Mama Leones.

181
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,482
It is your job, ladies, to spread the word.

182
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,322
Our grandmothers
may have been dressed in black...

183
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:15,298
but we're in Moschino and Armani.

184
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,036
For those who say Italian Americans...

185
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:23,166
eat smelly cheese and sip cold wine...

186
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:27,307
tell them
we're from the land of aromatic Asiago...

187
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,508
and supple Barolo.

188
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,819
If they say,"Spaghetti and meatballs"...

189
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:39,289
you tell them,
"Orecchiette with broccoli rabe."

190
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:47,396
If they say,"John Gotti,"
you tell them,"Rudolph Giuliani."

191
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:54,505
A Princeton study showed that 74 percent...

192
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:58,370
of Americans associated Italian Americans...

193
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:00,535
with organized crime.

194
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,048
Why would they do this?

195
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:06,216
Because of the way the media depict us.

196
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:10,720
Again, it is our job
to make sure people know...

197
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,918
the other side of Italian- American culture.

198
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:17,622
The educated, wage- earning,
law- abiding side.

199
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:21,458
Because isn't that who we truly are?

200
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:29,967
Thank you.

201
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,812
Thank you, Professor Murphy...

202
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,678
or should I call you
Professor Longo- Murphy?

203
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,412
Longo as you don't call me late for dinner.

204
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,409
Small point:

205
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,514
Didn't I read about
a more recent study at Fairleigh Dickinson...

206
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,525
that found the opposite was true?

207
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,993
That the great majority of Americans...

208
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,895
recognize these are fictional portrayals?

209
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:58,196
We're still looking at the sample
selection criteria used in that study.

210
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:01,396
Well, thanks for an excellent talk.

211
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,338
And thank you all for attending today.

212
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,576
Don't miss Professor Murphy's new book:

213
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:14,881
Strega: The Sorceress
as Imago Figure in Italian Literature.

214
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:21,421
And stick around for coffee and dessert,
courtesy of Cocuzzo's pastry shop.

215
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,827
I'll say it, that was totally uncalled for.

216
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:33,998
- Father Indianola’s forgetting his friends.
- It was outrageous. I'm shocked.

217
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:37,907
- Everyone's entitled to their opinion.
- Really, though, how dare he?

218
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:41,572
- After all you've done for this parish.
- What are you gonna do?

219
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,045
I'm gonna cut him a new one.

220
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,361
Father, I don't know what to say,
I'm so upset.

221
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,491
- Why, what's wrong?
- What's wrong?

222
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,332
Carmela is one of your biggest supporters
and friends.

223
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,430
How dare you let her suffer
humiliation and embarrassment...

224
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:11,032
- at the hands of an outsider?
- What do you mean?

225
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,340
You know exactly what I mean.

226
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:17,109
Unfortunately, because of her husband's
high profile in the waste industry...

227
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,309
she's the one
who bears the brunt of insults.

228
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,081
But there were many of us
who were equally offended.

229
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:23,553
I am sorry.

230
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:27,659
This is an open forum.
You did hear me bring up that new study.

231
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:30,160
If that's your idea
of a good luncheon speaker...

232
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,424
I suggest you think about
who really keeps...

233
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,932
this parish alive year after year.

234
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:47,145
The size of your cities
pain the eyes of the red man.

235
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,713
A man in your cities is numb to the stench--

236
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,306
Go back to your reservation!

237
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,476
Mussolini was Hitler's bitch!

238
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:54,541
Go back!

239
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,258
In the words of Chief Seattle:

240
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,993
"For the last Red Man shall have perished...

241
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,729
"and the memory of my tribe...

242
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:13,168
"shall have become a myth
among the White Men..."

243
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,502
Take your tom- toms and get out of here!

244
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,633
You son of a bitch!

245
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,611
"...these shores, these woods,
the highway will swarm...

246
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:24,547
"with the invisible dead of our people!
The White Man will never be alone!"

247
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:27,585
This is Newark, baby,
we don't play that shit!

248
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,017
And that better not be Columbus!

249
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,648
- Take it down.
- He's going to burn...

250
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:36,058
- the way our ancestors did!
- Go sit down, cupcake!

251
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:40,197
- We're not taking anything down!
- We're gonna fucking hang you up there!

252
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,233
Break it up! Let's break it up!

253
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,774
- We will make arrests!
- What the fuck is this, Joey?

254
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:55,302
They got a permit, Sil.
Everybody, come on, let's go!

255
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:58,109
- Everybody!
- I'll remember this, Joey.

256
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,412
Come on.

257
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,582
Come on. You, too.

258
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:10,887
Let me go.

259
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,524
All right, we gotta go.

260
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:18,959
Shit.

261
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,601
Down with globalization!

262
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,172
What are you doing?
This is a peaceful demonstration, here.

263
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,756
Everybody, get over here!

264
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,726
Get him out of here.

265
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,961
- Take the whole family.
- Let's do it.

266
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:52,900
Orecchiette and broccoli rabe.
The truth is, that is Northern.

267
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:55,633
Armani, too. And Michelangelo.

268
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:00,610
What a coward that man is.
He's always been a lily- liver.

269
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,772
- He's sweet.
- What did he say?

270
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,078
He's all apologetic now. I let him have it.

271
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,811
You did what you could.

272
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,149
I couldn't leave here
without saying something.

273
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,212
I gotta go. I'm getting my new crown today.

274
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,587
All right, bye.

275
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:19,053
Karen, bring Bobby and the kids over
for a cookout on Saturday.

276
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,547
- Hello?
- It's me, Dad.

277
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,613
- What's up, Bobby?
- Mom tried to call you.

278
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:43,379
She wants you to pick up some steaks
and eggplants before you come home.

279
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,047
She can't do it?

280
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:48,019
I'm stuck in traffic,
now I gotta go to the store?

281
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,288
She had to go get some crowns
or something.

282
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:53,229
Your mother's a real pain
in the you- know- what sometimes.

283
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,392
When she gets home,
tell her I said,"Thanks a lot."

284
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:03,397
- lf you can't find the recipe, I'll ask Angie.
- It's around here somewhere.

285
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,810
Hello. Hi, Gab.

286
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,378
What? When?

287
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:16,710
Oh, my God!

288
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,979
No!

289
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,522
God, that's terrible.

290
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:25,020
Yeah, okay.

291
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,890
What happened?

292
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:36,302
Karen had an accident on Pompton Avenue.

293
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:38,975
She's dead.

294
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:58,852
I get home for dinner last night,
Gabby's sitting there devastated.

295
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,029
I just saw Karen at ShopRite last week.

296
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,932
You talking about Karen?

297
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,169
Great kid.

298
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:11,737
This happened to this doctor I know.
Oriental ran right into him.

299
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,142
What's Bobby gonna do?
He adored that woman.

300
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,341
What are you doing getting arrested
when this family's on trial?

301
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,816
- I'm sorry--
- You went down there, too.

302
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,546
- No.
- It was my idea.

303
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,814
What the fuck?

304
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,823
We got little Paulie in St. Barnabas.
Plus, we lost face there.

305
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:29,759
This is something that hits home.
I can't turn the other cheek on this.

306
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,659
I know, but we're running a business, here.

307
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,933
Don't you all got something to do?

308
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,414
What's with you? I count on you
to be the most level- headed guy I got.

309
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,942
My father was a Knight of Columbus.
I'm Italian American...

310
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:57,515
and I pay money...

311
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:01,389
to the Italian Anti- Defamation
Coordination Council, and basta.

312
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:04,326
- We're the victims here.
- You write a check, too?

313
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,987
Let's not forget.

314
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,399
It was a friend of ours, Joe Columbo...

315
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:11,766
who founded the first Italian- American
anti- defamation organization.

316
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:14,305
- You were still out of line.
- You're right.

317
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,969
A hundred percent.

318
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:20,033
But?

319
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,369
Well...

320
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:25,950
as your consigliere, since you ask...

321
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:30,912
I think the guys, and myself, too,
we need your leadership on this.

322
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,657
All right, good.

323
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:39,556
I understand you wanna do something,
but use your brain.

324
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:43,089
Believe me, me and Ralphie
are working on a few things.

325
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:48,632
This battle's gonna be won
on the PR level. Hearts and minds.

326
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:52,574
They manipulate your image, Columbus...

327
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,876
you manipulate theirs.

328
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:57,078
All right.

329
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:15,531
- Who's calling, please?
- Good morning, Assemblyman.

330
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,589
What's up?

331
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,398
You know this protest
with the Indians and Columbus Day?

332
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:20,836
I heard about it.

333
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:22,873
We need somebody to make it go away.

334
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:26,570
Boy, that's a tough one. Real hot potato.

335
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,347
- Nobody wants to touch it.
- We just want...

336
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:32,577
a peaceful parade like always,
with no interference.

337
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,278
What's wrong with that?

338
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:37,286
It's the First Amendment,
and it's Native Americans.

339
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,587
Very sensitive stuff.

340
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,756
My hands are tied on this one. Sorry.

341
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:45,791
- Yeah, fine.
- I will be attending the parade as always.

342
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,889
You got my support there.

343
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,700
I wish that I could--

344
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:57,107
The last time that you dated
a friend and colleague...

345
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:59,541
of your brother's, he left you flat...

346
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:01,977
disappeared into
the witness protection program.

347
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,912
- I know.
- Now, another man...

348
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:05,813
who works with your brother...

349
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:09,376
unable to meet
your basic needs for love and respect...

350
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:12,051
involved with another woman.

351
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:14,718
Which brings me back to my childhood.

352
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,696
And my mother and my father.

353
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,061
Now we're talking.

354
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:22,896
Where I had no love and no support.

355
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:27,902
And where I was shamed and ridiculed
for being artistic.

356
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,507
In your relationship with these men...

357
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,476
you have replaced your father
with your brother...

358
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:37,641
as a figure of authority
that you need to prove something to.

359
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:39,944
You set up these scenarios
with these men...

360
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:43,317
similar to your father and your brother,
seeking your brother...

361
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:46,585
i. e. , your father's acceptance.

362
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:50,317
- The hell with them.
- I know.

363
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:52,886
The work is to make new choices...

364
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:55,455
that have nothing to do with old patterns.

365
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:58,535
I want to, Sandy, I do.

366
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,234
God give me the strength.

367
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:03,296
She will.

368
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:09,974
Your Star- Ledger interview conflicts
with Eye on New Jersey.

369
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:17,617
Del Redclay, right?

370
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:18,981
I knew it.

371
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,491
Yeah, I saw you on Channel 20.
Don't get up.

372
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,256
I'm Henry Caruso. Pleased to meet you.

373
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:30,368
- Now this lovely lady....
- Maggie Donner, I'm Del's TA.

374
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:33,300
Yes, I can see that.

375
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:38,776
Well, I might as well get to the point.

376
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:46,309
I represent a group of concerned citizens
who are...

377
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:49,349
very upset about this...

378
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,819
protest you're spearheading,
no puns intended.

379
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,553
- Who do you represent?
- Italians.

380
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,018
Here in New Jersey.

381
00:24:58,463 --> 00:24:59,691
Good people.

382
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,163
Family people.

383
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:06,102
And they've asked me to tell you that...

384
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:09,038
it's not in your best interest
to go through with this.

385
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:10,972
If you've come here to intimidate me...

386
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:14,842
- you don't know much about Indian resolve.
- Should I call security?

387
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,614
- You remember this guy?
- Iron Eyes Cody, he was an actor.

388
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:23,944
Son of Paleface, Sitting Bull.

389
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,783
Your fucking poster boy.

390
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:32,856
Part Cherokee, part Cree.

391
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,493
He wasn't even a fucking Indian.

392
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:40,728
Second generation Sicilian
from Louisiana named Espera DeCorti.

393
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:44,466
- I think you better leave now.
- The guy's a total fucking phony.

394
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,200
A total fugace.

395
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,803
Even Jay Silverheels knew it.

396
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:51,311
But he kept it quiet.

397
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,550
We're not gonna.

398
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:58,312
You keep up your bullshit,
we're gonna go wide with this thing.

399
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,519
Knock yourself out.

400
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:11,027
Jesus Christ, is this true?
This is a fucking disaster!

401
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:14,594
Chill out. You didn't know about this?

402
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:18,634
- It's been on Access Hollywood, E! --
- This is a major PR boner.

403
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,143
It's been researched.

404
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:23,408
Cody was definitely Native American.
Total environmentalist.

405
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:27,713
- Are you sure about this?
- Look, I'm one- eighth Italian myself.

406
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,547
You are? You never told me that.

407
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:32,988
My great- great something or other
was a pony soldier.

408
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:37,753
Well, actually he was a violinist
attached to the Seventh Cavalry.

409
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,257
That is just one person's opinion, Anthony.

410
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:48,067
What, football again?
He's not gonna get hurt, he's a tough kid.

411
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,536
Jesus.

412
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,133
We're having a discussion
about Christopher Columbus.

413
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,609
"They would make fine servants.

414
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,210
"With 50 men, we could subgate them-- "

415
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,614
Subjugate.

416
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,610
"...and make them do whatever we want."

417
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,848
That doesn't sound like
a slave trader to you?

418
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:09,018
George Washington had slaves,
the father of our country.

419
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:10,288
Well, what's your point?

420
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:13,422
His history teacher, Mr. Cushman,
is teaching your son...

421
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:17,366
that if Columbus was alive today, he'd
go on trial for crimes against humanity...

422
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:19,960
like Milosevic in, you know, Europe.

423
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,338
Your teacher said that?

424
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:25,069
It's not just my teacher, it's the truth.

425
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,077
It's in my history book.

426
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,510
So you finally read a book and it's bullshit.

427
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:37,446
You had to walk in Columbus' shoes
to see what he went through.

428
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:40,047
People thought the world was flat,
for crying out loud.

429
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:44,391
Then he lands on an island with a bunch of
naked savages on it. That took a lot of guts.

430
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:47,454
You remember when we went to Florida,
the heat, and those bugs?

431
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:50,262
Like it took guts to murder people
and put them in chains.

432
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,327
- He was a victim of his time.
- Who cares? It's what he did.

433
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,396
He discovered America, is what he did.

434
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:56,997
He was a brave Italian explorer.

435
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,305
And in this house,
Christopher Columbus is a hero.

436
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:00,867
End of story.

437
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,198
I should've known.

438
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:31,606
I should've known you needed me.

439
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:34,268
I should've been with you.

440
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,478
I should've been in your place.

441
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,580
My love, my sweet love.

442
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,101
How he loved her.

443
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:18,251
You know what I heard one time?

444
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:21,053
Sil was on the phone.
He was talking with somebody...

445
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:24,755
about how Bobby was the only one of them
who doesn't have a cumare.

446
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:26,694
They were laughing at him.

447
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,962
- Who was he talking to on the phone?
- I don't know.

448
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:37,703
I'll go first this time.
I'll bring my eggplant parm over to Bobby's.

449
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,267
Actually, tomorrow is better for me.

450
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,114
Ginny, hi.

451
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:49,013
We were just talking about
who's gonna do what when.

452
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,817
I played canasta with her just last week.

453
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,823
There he is. John, look...

454
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:05,359
I'm sorry I missed Allegra's
nursing school graduation. Unforgivable.

455
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,738
But I made it up to her.

456
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,038
Stick it in your ass.

457
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:17,643
- Hey, Count Chocula--
- What the fuck, John?

458
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:19,580
Keep him away from me.

459
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:23,817
- John, what's going on?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

460
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:26,556
What's this?

461
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,358
I have no fucking idea.

462
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:33,924
But I got better shit to do.

463
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:43,741
You saw how it was with them
at dinner the other night?

464
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,002
Something's going on.

465
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:52,674
Plus, out of nowhere, Carmine's up my ass
on this Frelinghuysen Avenue bullshit.

466
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,581
Somebody's talking too much.

467
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:56,853
And it's costing me money.

468
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:00,319
Come on.

469
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:04,054
There's no release.

470
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,493
I'm surrounded by death.

471
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:09,226
My husband, my son, my friend.

472
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,428
I don't know what to tell you, Ro.

473
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:15,268
There's pieces torn out of me,
chunks of me that are dead.

474
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:18,833
Look at me.
My youth, my looks, they're gone.

475
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:19,899
No.

476
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:23,174
That's from not taking care of yourself.

477
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:27,009
- Dwelling on all this stuff.
- It's not "stuff."

478
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:31,112
Do you have any idea what it feels like?

479
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:33,517
Do you?

480
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:37,020
It's not "stuff." It's death, it's pain!

481
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,592
I'm having a lot of trouble dealing with this.

482
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:49,004
- I don't know.
- You don't know what?

483
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:52,969
I don't think I can do this.

484
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:56,939
I don't think I can help you.

485
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,279
You need a lot right now.

486
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,518
I don't think there's anything I can do.

487
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,557
You can be there for me,
you could comfort me.

488
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,427
What about me?

489
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,359
- What do I get out of it?
- There it is.

490
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,763
Right there. What do you get?

491
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:19,297
How about your every need taken care of?

492
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:24,398
Sexually, everything!
All your shit. It's all about you, isn't it?

493
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:27,470
It's not all about me, but, I mean...

494
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:31,175
- let's be realistic.
- "Let's be realistic"?

495
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,147
What, you wanna leave me?

496
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:39,011
Yeah.

497
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,656
Then get the fuck out.

498
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:45,061
It doesn't have to be like this.

499
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:48,098
How should it be?
How the fuck should it be?

500
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:01,637
Somehow Carmine found out
we were flipping properties...

501
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:05,308
on Frelinghuysen Avenue, so your take's
a little less than we talked about.

502
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,283
He makes an issue out of Zellman?

503
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:11,647
- What's this one called, Hesh?
- This is Pie- O- My.

504
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:15,051
Just broke her maiden
at Belmont last month. A lot of speed.

505
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:16,957
- I'm buying her.
- Cool, man.

506
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,086
She's beautiful.

507
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,459
That's right.

508
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:23,626
Don't you know somebody over there at...

509
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:26,033
Deerpark Casino in Connecticut?

510
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:27,894
Run by the Mohonk tribe?

511
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:29,837
Yeah, Marty. My niece's husband.

512
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:32,899
This Columbus Day protest,
we need somebody to make it go away.

513
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,535
What's wrong with freedom of speech?

514
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:36,580
Listen to my kid talking about Columbus.

515
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:37,875
Calls him a murdering thief.

516
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,975
- They wiped out almost all of my people.
- Cubans are from Spain.

517
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:44,920
They were Taino Indians who got raped
by Columbus and the Conquistadors.

518
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:46,013
That's right, Reuben.

519
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,558
Mulignon got Martin Luther King Day,
what do we got?

520
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:51,424
- I have sympathy for the red man.
- Why is that?

521
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:54,761
Jews, because of their history,
have common cause with the oppressed.

522
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:58,461
Some Indians were deliberately
given blankets tainted with smallpox.

523
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,595
- Died like flies.
- No shit?

524
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:02,298
- Yeah, shit.
- Yeah?

525
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:05,101
You wanna talk about terrorism?
Look who started it.

526
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:07,371
- Amen to that, my friend.
- That's right.

527
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:10,005
Christopher Columbus
was no better than Adolf Hitler.

528
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:11,877
Back up.

529
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:13,850
- Hitler?
- Yeah.

530
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,442
I'm not the only one who thinks so.

531
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,354
That Indian from the protest
who was whining about the wilderness?

532
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,858
They had him on TV. ,
and he called Columbus Hitler.

533
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:24,793
- 'Cause it's true, man.
- You're talking out of your ass.

534
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:27,990
Columbus and Hitler?
You're trivializing the Holocaust.

535
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:31,661
Frankly, Reuben, if you got
that kind of covert anti- Semitism...

536
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,431
I'd like you to leave my house.

537
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:35,301
- Anti- Semitism?
- That's right.

538
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,068
Fuck you, too, my man!

539
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:40,668
Guys, come on. Reuben, Hesh,
you guys been friends for years.

540
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:53,555
I'll call Marty up in Connecticut.
He knows a big Mohonk.

541
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,650
That cocksucker.

542
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:59,822
We're not tired.
I didn't spill food'cause I'm tired.

543
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:03,967
Don't argue, okay?
Listen to your Aunt Grace and Aunt Mary.

544
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:05,662
Do what they say.

545
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,701
All right, say good night
to your Aunt Carmela.

546
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,870
Good night, Aunt Carmela.

547
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,348
It's great your family could come down.

548
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:21,476
They're leaving tomorrow.
Somebody's sick up there.

549
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:22,883
Dad?

550
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:34,824
- Dad, Sophia locked the door!
- Should I get that?

551
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,890
He takes all my pencils!

552
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:47,273
- Baccilieri residence.
- Carmela, is that you?

553
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,171
- It's Corrado.
- Hello.

554
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:53,775
How's my boy, Bobby, doing?
He knows I couldn't make it to the services.

555
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:57,548
- He's all right, he's upstairs with the kids.
- What a heartbreak.

556
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:01,450
You know, I remember
the first time I met her like it was yesterday.

557
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:04,984
It was my birthday dinner
at Roman Gardens. I'll never forget it.

558
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:07,690
She said I looked like Pablo Picasso.

559
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,858
And I didn't even know what he looked like.

560
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:12,368
But one day,
she showed me a picture of him...

561
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:13,994
and, you know, she was right.

562
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:15,834
That's very touching. Let me get Bobby.

563
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:19,308
I wanna know if he'll pick me up for court
or if I should call Murf.

564
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:22,835
Maybe you should let Bobby be.
Think about his needs instead of your own.

565
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:25,576
It's not me. Don't villainize me, here.

566
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,551
Murf goes to bed early,
so I wanted to call him now...

567
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,644
if I need him to drive me.

568
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:34,555
I don't wanna disturb him when he's asleep.
He's an old man, for God's sake.

569
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:52,933
Stella!

570
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:56,145
What the fuck are you doing?

571
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:01,542
We don't have to hide, baby. I did it.

572
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:05,749
- I told Ro.
- You told her about us?

573
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:06,983
No.

574
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:11,326
I told her I didn't
wanna be with her anymore, and I left!

575
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,068
Now I can devote myself to you completely.

576
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:31,773
Now there can be no more fear.

577
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,573
No more guilt.

578
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,382
- Just sex.
- Yeah.

579
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,050
You know what I want.

580
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:43,320
And you want it all, don't you?

581
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,461
Oh, yeah. You need me, slut.

582
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:51,628
I need it all, baby!

583
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:54,966
Oh, shit!

584
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:58,809
Tonight's my night.
I gotta bring food over to Bobby Bacala's.

585
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,835
You're on ziti patrol, too?

586
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:04,747
- Ro's got Thursdays.
- Well, what should I do?

587
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:16,924
You could do me a solid, Tony.

588
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:18,791
Next time you see Hesh...

589
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:22,726
remind him
my granddaughter's Bat Mitzvah present...

590
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,791
doesn't really work.

591
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:28,327
The bubble jet printer.
I don't like to keep hocking him.

592
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:30,600
He knows about it.

593
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:32,899
He said he lost the sales slip.

594
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,036
So, Marty, where is this guy?

595
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:40,175
There he is. What'd I say? Right on cue.

596
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,611
Chief.

597
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:45,554
- Where, behind the preppy guy?
- That's him.

598
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:51,825
Chief, I'd like to introduce you
to my friends, Silvio Dante...

599
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,988
Tony Soprano.
The guy I was telling you about.

600
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,399
Chief Doug Smith.

601
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:02,264
Tribal chairman of the Mohonk Indians
and CEO of Mohonk Enterprises.

602
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,241
- An honor.
- Thanks for coming all the way down here.

603
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:08,506
- I had business in Manhattan anyway.
- Not again.

604
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:12,871
Would you bring the gentleman
a Ketel One, please?

605
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:18,714
So, Chief, he told you about
the shit going down in Newark?

606
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,417
Small element. Ruins it for the rest of us.

607
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:25,758
I've got a $250 million casino
and a huge Italian- American customer base.

608
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,390
Providence, east Boston. Good people.

609
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:31,128
Our part of the world.
We're closer than Atlantic City.

610
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,966
This is a brand new facility, state- of- the- art.

611
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:37,496
This fucking protest. They're burning
Columbus in effigy down there.

612
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:40,942
- They'll lay down in front of the parade.
- That's not gonna happen.

613
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:44,412
People like Redclay,
they're out of touch, in their ivory towers.

614
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:46,780
They don't understand
the economic opportunity...

615
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:49,046
that funds
much of the Native American community.

616
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,748
You should see
the Olympic- size swimming pool...

617
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:55,189
this man put in
the Deerpark reservation rec center.

618
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,055
Well, we all got kids.

619
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:01,462
We don't want to see our heritage attacked,
that's all.

620
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:12,006
No offense, Chief,
but you don't look much like an Indian.

621
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,510
Frankly, I passed most of my life as white...

622
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:17,604
until I had a racial awakening
and discovered my Mohonk blood.

623
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:21,378
My grandmother on my father's side,
her mother was a quarter Mohonk.

624
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:24,215
All this happened
when the casino bill got passed, right?

625
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:27,689
- Better late than never.
- Mohonk if you love Columbus.

626
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,363
Sorry I didn't make it last night.

627
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:39,600
My Bible group had a potluck for
the homeless and I was on cleanup crew.

628
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,698
Food, food.
Like that solves all the world's problems.

629
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:46,971
Bobby, we've been neighbors.
I know that we don't talk much...

630
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:49,638
but if you want to, I'm here for you.

631
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:06,292
What is it?

632
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:12,468
That day...

633
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,106
when she had the accident...

634
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:19,241
I was stuck in traffic.

635
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:24,543
And my son called because Karen
wanted me to pick up steaks and eggplants.

636
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:27,307
And I was mad at her for sending me.

637
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:29,018
I was tired.

638
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:36,556
I was mad at her. But I was stuck in traffic
because of her accident.

639
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:42,028
She was up the road ahead of me,
lying in twisted metal.

640
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:45,230
But I didn't know,
and I could've been with her.

641
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:47,793
I should've been there to help her.

642
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:51,404
But I was mad at her.

643
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:55,937
My sweet Karen.

644
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:59,105
My sweet girl.

645
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,347
Pass me the peppers.

646
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,054
Hello.

647
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:20,333
Yeah. Just a second.

648
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,865
Ton', it's the Indian Chief.

649
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:34,475
Doug, how are you?

650
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:39,353
Tony, I wish I had better news.
I struck out. Redclay didn't go for it.

651
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:42,487
Ask him about the Iron Eyes Cody thing.

652
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,187
The guy pretended he didn't know me.

653
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:45,785
You believe the son of a bitch?

654
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:47,490
Ask him about Cody.

655
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:50,123
You ask him about Iron Eyes Cody?

656
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,794
He didn't give a shit.
It was some internet rumor.

657
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:55,031
Most Native Americans
don't give a flying fuck.

658
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:57,403
It's like knowing James Caan isn't Italian.

659
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:58,998
All right, well...

660
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,476
it was nice meeting you,
and I appreciate the effort.

661
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:04,480
You gotta let me make it up to you.
Come on up, spend a day.

662
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:08,245
Sil, whoever you want.
High rollers room, everything comped.

663
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,651
- Sure, that sounds good.
- Great.

664
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:14,980
What the fuck did he say
about Iron Eyes Cody?

665
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:16,720
He said Ralphie had it all fucked up.

666
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:21,458
And it don't mean nothing anyway, 'cause
it's like knowing James Caan isn't Italian.

667
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:33,602
We think this guy, Redclay,
is fucking a graduate student.

668
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:36,703
- We hire a detective--
- I think it's over, Sil.

669
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,347
- Yeah, but all we gotta--
- It's over.

670
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:46,915
He had just lost his wife.

671
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:49,826
And he had so much sadness.

672
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:54,362
So much love for her,
such complete and pure emotion.

673
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:58,461
I felt unworthy to even be in his presence.

674
00:43:58,535 --> 00:44:01,060
I was so moved by him.

675
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:05,698
And then I look at Ralphie.

676
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:09,872
You saw, in this man,
the things that you want in your life.

677
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:13,179
Truth.

678
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:15,617
- Love.
- Yes.

679
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:21,624
Somehow, I have to find a way to move away
from the darkness and toward the light.

680
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:23,756
What does this man do?

681
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,387
He works with my brother,
but he's not like the others.

682
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:29,227
- Janice--
- Sandy, he's different. Believe me.

683
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:31,456
Okay.

684
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,529
But back to Ralph.

685
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:39,502
You've got to sit him down...

686
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:40,804
and level with him.

687
00:44:40,878 --> 00:44:42,573
Speak the truth, Jan...

688
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:46,443
but with the compassion and respect
that you're famous for.

689
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,145
And say goodbye...

690
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:51,750
for his sake, as well as yours.

691
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,347
You're right.

692
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,161
It's not his fault.

693
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:07,836
Roll me some numbers, fearless leader.

694
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:10,169
- Coming at you.
- Yeah, I'm ready, six.

695
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:12,876
It's all right.

696
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:16,640
You had a great run, T.
You held the dice for quite a while.

697
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:21,711
Look at this operation.

698
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:23,548
Whenever I'm in one of these places...

699
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:26,316
I remember that my grandmother
was part Fugawe.

700
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,688
Maybe I should do something about it.

701
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:31,124
- Bullshit.
- No, it's true.

702
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:34,895
She was. They were a nomadic tribe,
they'd wander around, get lost...

703
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:36,796
and they go,"Where the Fugawe?"

704
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:42,696
I see you gentlemen are having a good time.
You getting enough to eat?

705
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:43,762
Yeah.

706
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:46,006
Running out of my comps here.

707
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,442
Go find Marty. He's on the floor somewhere.

708
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:51,345
Tony, can we talk a minute?
Buy you a drink?

709
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:53,005
Yeah, sure.

710
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:58,652
I wanted to give you a check
for Jason's tuition.

711
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:00,181
Okay.

712
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:04,188
- The statement's up in my bedroom.
- That's okay, I trust you.

713
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:05,555
Wait...

714
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:07,429
is it 5:00?

715
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:13,262
John, I'm here
at Christopher Columbus Park in Newark...

716
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:16,238
where this afternoon
violence broke out briefly...

717
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:20,265
between Native American demonstrators
and members of a coalition...

718
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:24,337
of 18 various
Italian- American pride organizations.

719
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:28,310
Get out of here! This is our day!
You hear that?

720
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:30,615
He fed our people to his dogs!

721
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:36,356
My God, this is tragic.

722
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:43,060
Could be scored with Albinoni's Adagio.

723
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:15,587
Janootski!

724
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:24,740
This is it, hon.

725
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:27,639
This is the last of the stuff I had at Ro's.

726
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:31,273
Your shoes.

727
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:33,205
What?

728
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:37,049
Didn't I ask you to take your shoes off
when you came in this house?

729
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:40,745
Forgot.

730
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:43,282
- Sorry, hon.
- You forgot.

731
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:46,326
So that's just it. You fucking forgot!

732
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,358
Oh, fuck.

733
00:47:54,771 --> 00:47:56,796
Get out!

734
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:02,977
My back.

735
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:05,907
I'll kill you, you crazy bitch.

736
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:09,283
I'll kill you, you bitch. You crazy cunt!

737
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:10,946
Get out!

738
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:36,742
It's gotta be on here somewhere.

739
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:39,474
...scuffle at the Columbus Day parade
in Newark.

740
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:42,040
Among those arrested
for blocking a fire lane...

741
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:44,053
was Native American activist Del Redclay...

742
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:46,282
who called the protest
an unqualified success.

743
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:49,086
Elsewhere, a blind river rafter
is going to get her wish...

744
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:52,026
after suing for a place
in the Colorado River--

745
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:54,029
I should've been there.

746
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:59,966
I would've been fucking there.
I forgot this was a Monday.

747
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:09,003
- Maybe we ought to just whack this prick.
- Who the fuck are you kidding?

748
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:11,671
All you thought about was blackjack.

749
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:15,418
What? You think this day in the country
was free, don't you?

750
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,443
Well, it wasn't.

751
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:21,048
Fucking Chief Smith wants Frankie Valli
to come up there and play a week.

752
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,991
That's what this whole fucking junket
was about.

753
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:26,254
- Frankie?
- Yeah, that's right.

754
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,026
That's why he buttonholed me, goddamn it.

755
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:30,964
There's bad blood with Frankie's manager.

756
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:35,232
So the Chief wants me to call him
as payback for him reaching out to Redclay.

757
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,398
Well, you're gonna make the fucking call.

758
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:41,570
- I ain't seen Frankie for years--
- Tough shit! You're making the fucking call!

759
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:44,273
You and this fucking parade, already.

760
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:54,621
I don't know what you're so hot about.

761
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:58,525
They discriminate against all Italians
as a group when they disallow Columbus--

762
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:01,359
Will you fucking stop?"Group"!

763
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:09,965
What the fuck happened to Gary Cooper?
That's what I'd like to know.

764
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:11,904
He died.

765
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:15,776
You mean, 'cause he fought the Sioux
in all those westerns?

766
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,313
Fuck that.

767
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:19,847
Gary Cooper.

768
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:21,979
Now there was an American.

769
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:25,449
The strong, silent type.
He did what he had to do.

770
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:27,054
He faced down the Miller gang...

771
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:30,252
when none of those other assholes
would lift a finger to help him.

772
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:33,956
And did he complain? Did he say,
"l come from this poor Texas- Irish...

773
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:37,330
"illiterate background or whatever,
so leave me the fuck out of it...

774
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:39,301
"because my people got fucked over"?

775
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,337
T, not for nothing...

776
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:44,071
but you're getting a little confused here.

777
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:45,870
A: That was the movies.

778
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:47,671
What difference does that make?

779
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:51,578
Columbus was so long ago,
he might as well have been a fucking movie.

780
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:53,309
Images, you said.

781
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,212
The point is, Gary Cooper...

782
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,817
the real Gary Cooper...

783
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:02,789
or anybody named Cooper,
never suffered like the Italians.

784
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:07,018
A madigan like him,
they fucked everybody else.

785
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,359
The Italians, the Polacks, the Blacks.

786
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,125
All right, even if he was a madigan
around nowadays...

787
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:15,797
he'd be a member of some victims' group.

788
00:51:15,872 --> 00:51:19,933
The fundamentalist Christians,
the abused cowboys, the gays, whatever.

789
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:23,468
- He was gay, Gary Cooper?
- No! Are you listening to me?

790
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:26,373
Hey, people suffered.

791
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:28,510
Did you?

792
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:30,549
Except for maybe the feds.

793
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:34,647
My grandparents got spit on
because they were from Calabria.

794
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:38,490
Let me ask you a question.
All the good things you got in your life...

795
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:41,326
did they come to you
'cause you're Calabrese?

796
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:45,729
I'll tell you the answer. The answer is no.

797
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:48,134
You got a smart kid at Lackawanna College.

798
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:52,301
You got a wife who's a piece of ass.
At least she was when you married her.

799
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:55,606
You own one of the most profitable
topless bars in North Jersey.

800
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:57,544
Did you get all this'cause you're Italian?

801
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:01,812
No, you got it'cause you're you,
'cause you're smart, 'cause you're whatever.

802
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:05,614
Where the fuck is our self- esteem?

803
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:11,092
That shit doesn't come from Columbus,
or The Godfather, or Chef fucking Boyardee.

804
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,497
We gotta tiptoe around the Indians though,
don't we?

805
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:19,626
We can't call our teams
the Braves or the Tomahawks or the--

806
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:22,934
You take it up with Frankie Valli
when you talk to him.
