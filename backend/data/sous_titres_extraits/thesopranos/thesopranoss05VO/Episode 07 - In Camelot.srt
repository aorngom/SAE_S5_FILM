1
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,000
Don't tell me we fight. I try to get along.

2
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,300
You can't just say
whatever comes to mind.

3
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,100
You were horrible.
That shit about the roadies...

4
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,800
You hit below the belt yourself, Jan,
and you started it.

5
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,900
No cheese for Sophia.

6
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,600
Those kids seem to like you, sort of.

7
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,000
I leave them completely free to do
whatever they want.

8
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,900
How else are they gonna learn
from their mistakes?

9
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,600
Anyway, thank you for having us over.

10
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,100
What's this you're watching?

11
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,100
Beethoven.

12
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,200
- Can we get a dog?
- Please?

13
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,800
I'll walk him,
and I'll pick up the poo and pee.

14
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Pee? Right. Start with your underwear.

15
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,500
We had a dog, remember? Tippy?

16
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,800
He got worms though,
had to move to the country.

17
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,600
Tippy was gassed, Tony.
Daddy took him to the pound.

18
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,000
He used to drag his ass on the carpet
just to scratch himself.

19
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,300
- My mother went crazy.
- Gassed?

20
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,600
And he's so cynical about everything else.

21
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,200
Father told me
he took him to live on a farm.

22
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,500
That's what they always say. That same
farm must have 17 billion dogs on it.

23
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,200
Dogshit up to the rafters.

24
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,000
What? Oh, no, that's terrible.

25
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,700
- What? What's the matter?
- It's Cousin Josephine. Aunt Concett' died.

26
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,800
- What happened?
- They think it was a heart attack.

27
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,500
Uncle Zio found her on the couch
after Meet The Press.

28
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,300
We hereby commend Concetta to the Lord

29
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,200
embraced in His divine goodness.

30
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,100
- Let us go in peace. Amen.
- Amen.

31
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,100
Listen, as long as we're here

32
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,000
I was gonna go visit my father.

33
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,900
Like to join me?

34
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,100
Five hours, they let me out for these funerals.
I gotta spend it bein' maudlin?

35
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,900
It's a beautiful day.

36
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,600
I thought you might wanna pay your respects
to your brother.

37
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,900
By crying to a chunk of marble?

38
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,000
I can pay my respects from the after-party.

39
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,400
After-party?

40
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,200
It's those uptake inhibitors. We were sceptical
at first, then his mood improved.

41
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,300
His memory, too.

42
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,700
Excuse me.

43
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
Excuse me. Hi.

44
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,800
- Oh, hello.
- You knew my mother?

45
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,400
You're Anthony. Oh, my God.

46
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,000
- Do I know you?
- Oh, no.

47
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,600
- No, no, you're not annoying me.
- No, no... Do we know each other?

48
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,500
Oh, we met once.

49
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,300
I was a friend of your father's.

50
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,800
You're the lady from Bamberger's...
from the fur department.

51
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,500
- Fran Felstein.
- Tony.

52
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,000
How you doin'?

53
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,000
So what, you... You come visit?

54
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,600
I miss your father sometimes. It's...

55
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,000
It's foolish.

56
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,400
Nah, don't say that.

57
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,200
No, I was sorry to hear about your mother.

58
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,400
At least she didn't suffer.

59
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,400
She made all of us suffer instead.

60
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,300
Oh, it was a joke. She made all of us suffer.

61
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,200
Believe me,
I heard the stories from your dad.

62
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,100
You must forgive me.
My hearing... the last few years...

63
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,400
How about a hearin' aid?
They're little now. You can't see 'em.

64
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,900
I'm too vain. Anyway...
Johnny was very proud of you.

65
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,800
You were very special to him.

66
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,200
I'm sure you were too.

67
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,200
Johnny told me if I ever needed anything
I should always call his son.

68
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,100
What do you need?

69
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,900
Not a thing.

70
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,900
Fran Felstein?

71
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,200
- That was class.
- She's got great legs for an old broad.

72
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,400
I was in love with that woman.

73
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,900
She was the reason I never married.
I wanted to propose.

74
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,400
- I had the ring all picked out.
- So what? She turned you down?

75
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,200
I hesitated. How could I bring
this life we live on a woman?

76
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,200
Anyway,
she took it as a sign I wasn't interested.

77
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:18,600
Then one night we were all at the 500 Club
to see Enzo Stuarti. Your father shows up.

78
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,800
Sy Devore suit, two-inch lapel - that was that.

79
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,100
She never knew my feelings. What could I do?

80
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,700
For years, I suffered in silence.

81
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,600
Mario, did you bring your guitar?

82
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Not to this.

83
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,800
- Angie, come on. Sing us a song.
- You sing, Junior.

84
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,700
Nobody wants to hear me.

85
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Mario, remember?

86
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,600
Thanks, my name's JT.
I'm an alcoholic and an addict.

87
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,800
Hi, JT.

88
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,300
I'm also a TV writer which, by default,
makes me a douche bag,

89
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,700
but you would've figured that out
for yourselves.

90
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,000
About 15 years ago,
I moved from Jersey to Hollywood

91
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,600
broke into the biz.

92
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,800
It was a dream come true. I had money,

93
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,800
I had the Beemer, the actress girlfriend.

94
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:33,200
Best of all, I had all the flake I needed
to keep me churning out that snappy dialogue.

95
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,200
Drugs, alcohol - that shit practically
comes with the Writers' Guild card.

96
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,100
Anyway,

97
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,800
before too long, I discovered heroin.

98
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,600
Then things really started to fall apart.

99
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,700
It got so bad
that I blew a deadline on a Nash Bridges.

100
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,200
I got my ass fired. I didn't work for 18 months.

101
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,900
By the grace of God, I got myself
into a rehab programme in Pennsylvania

102
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:09,200
and, with the help of some good friends
that I made there, I got through it.

103
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,000
Chris, where are you?
There's my man Chris, everybody.

104
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,200
Anyway, I wanna talk a little bit about
takin' a moral inventory.

105
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,700
So we talked for, like, an hour.

106
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,000
Well, it turns out that they had a thing,
her and my old man. Right up till he died.

107
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,300
He got from this woman
what he couldn't get at home.

108
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,800
Support...

109
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,600
You know, love.

110
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,800
A smile when you walk in the fuckin' door.

111
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,200
Do you think that justifies his infidelity?

112
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:48,600
She drove him into that woman's arms,
my mother. To all his women.

113
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'll tell you one thing.
Over the years he was rottin' in that grave

114
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,000
I can't remember once
my mother goin' to visit him.

115
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But this lady, Fran...

116
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,100
It's possible your mother found it very painful.

117
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,800
- Oh, poor her.
- What was it like sitting there with Fran?

118
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,500
A little weird at first...

119
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,800
Here I am comforting my father's mistress.
My mother's lyin' there, dead.

120
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,100
- Are you attracted to her?
- She's old enough to be my mother!

121
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,300
Oh, Jesus Christ, it's an expression.

122
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,800
Don't cream yourself.
I did not want to fuck my mother!

123
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:39,900
You should've seen her in her hairnet.
This conversation'd be over in two seconds.

124
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,800
So, I figured, why not move back to Jersey?

125
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,100
Clean slate. It's better.

126
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,200
My new agent? Next week,
he's got me set up to meet Dick Wolf's guy.

127
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
I seen Dick Wolf at Rao's one night.

128
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,300
Guy's got his own limo.

129
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,800
That Law And Order money?
The guy could have his own battleship.

130
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,300
But, enough of my shit. How are you doin'?

131
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,700
Good, you know.

132
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,100
Workin' the programme.

133
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,400
I had some fuckin' wine, all right?
Is that what you wanna hear?

134
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,800
- Christopher, when was this?
- I don't know. My fiancée was in a car crash.

135
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,600
I didn't even like it.
I went to a meeting the next day.

136
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,300
But no slip since then?

137
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,300
I've been sober and I've been high.
Sober's better.

138
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,700
- You know you can call me any time?
- What? You got a date?

139
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,200
I gotta meet somebody, a friend.

140
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,300
- Go ahead, I'll get this.
- Thanks, bro.

141
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,600
Listen, call me. I'm serious.

142
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,100
- Harold Melvoin.
- Mel, it's me.

143
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,100
- Corrado, what's up?
- There's a funeral I need to attend.

144
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,700
I want you to call the feds.

145
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,600
Vincent Patronella.

146
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,600
Is he a relative? You know the rules.

147
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,100
He's my niece's godfather. I think I met him
at a barbecue for the bicentennial.

148
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,700
All they can say is no.

149
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:41,300
Your father used to bring me flowers
all the time - flowers and lingerie.

150
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,400
I'm making chicken,
Cuban style with black beans.

151
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,000
What's this?

152
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,700
Ketchup? Sure. If you want.

153
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,300
No, the kid and the dog.

154
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,100
My son, Bruce.

155
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:05,700
He married an Israeli girl.
He's a food service director with El Al.

156
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,800
- No, no, no, the dog.
- Oh, Freckles?

157
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,700
- He was a gift from your dad.
- What?

158
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,500
Aw, when?

159
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,600
Oh, this is my fuckin' dog!

160
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,300
Excuse me, I'm sorry. This was my dog!
His name was Tippy!

161
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,200
Your dad never said.

162
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,100
I don't fuckin' believe this.

163
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,900
My mother made him give the dog away.

164
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,800
Well, Bruce loved him.

165
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,100
He had him for almost ten years,
till he moved to Tel Aviv.

166
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,700
Then I had to put him to sleep.

167
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,100
Those are the pictures, on the coffee table.

168
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,900
The slippers were your dad's, too.

169
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,200
Look at this. The two of you.

170
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,300
He used to remind me of Victor Mature.

171
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,500
Outside the Latin Quarter.

172
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:26,400
- Holy shit, look at Hesh. George Gershwin.
- He was a whoremaster, and cheap.

173
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,300
He screwed me out of my retirement money.

174
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,800
Against your dad's wishes, by the way.

175
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,100
- What are you talkin' about?
- Don't get me started.

176
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,800
- Come on, what happened?
- Your dad owned a racetrack.

177
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,700
With the midget auto racing.

178
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,000
The Chickamauga Raceway
over in New Egypt.

179
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,900
Him, Herman, some other guy...

180
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:58,000
- Phil something. With the hair, from New York.
- Leotardo.

181
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,000
My father cut him in to pay off a poker debt.

182
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,600
Johnny always told me
his piece would go to me.

183
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,100
Couldn't put me in his will, obviously.

184
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,400
When he passed, your dad...

185
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,500
I called Hesh.

186
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,400
He sent me 500 bucks.

187
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,700
That's it?

188
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,800
I'm sorry.

189
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,000
Jesus Christ, I wish you'd called me.

190
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:35,400
- Bruce sends me money occasionally.
- That's not the point. It's my father's wishes.

191
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,500
Look, forget it. Seriously, I'm sorry.

192
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,100
I shouldn't have even brought it up.

193
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,700
Listen, after we eat, you wanna take a ride?

194
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,000
So I saw my Uncle Jun'.

195
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,800
- He says to say hello.
- Junior?

196
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,700
Jesus. How's he doing?

197
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,900
I don't know if you know it,
but he was always a little hot for you.

198
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
He was practically a stalker.

199
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,100
- He said he suffered in silence.
- Suffered in silence?

200
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,400
He used to skulk outside my building, all hours.

201
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,900
Weird phone calls. I always had a hunch
he told Livia about me and Johnny.

202
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,200
Jesus Christ.

203
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,200
She was a handsome woman, your mother.

204
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,700
Not sexy, exactly, but statuesque.

205
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,500
Little nip?

206
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
- What is it?
- One for the road, honey.

207
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,100
And this looks like road to me.

208
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,100
Rémy Martin, VSOP.

209
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,600
They can't be making much,
but if I know Hesh

210
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,300
him and Phil got something going on here.

211
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,700
So, tell me about your women.

212
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
Your wife, what's she like?

213
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,700
I don't know. What's to tell?

214
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,100
Good woman, good mother.

215
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,400
Marriage hit the rocks, that's all.
What are you gonna do?

216
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,000
How about your girlfriend?

217
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,200
She's an art dealer. Very sophisticated.

218
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,100
Dark hair, dark eyes. She's Latin.

219
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,200
You know, from Spain.

220
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
That's it.

221
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,100
Oh, man, I'm so glad you called.
I really needed this.

222
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,200
- So?
- So, what?

223
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,800
There's nothing you wanna talk about?

224
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,600
I was honest with you the other night.

225
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,600
- You're telling me you're not using?
- What?

226
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,700
You ran out of IHOP like you were on fire
and jonesing like a motherfucker.

227
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,700
I was going with a girl to the track.
The Meadowlands.

228
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,600
I didn't wanna miss the last race.

229
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,700
I am totally clean and sober.

230
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,900
Jesus Christ.
I was positive you fucking slipped.

231
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,800
Thank you, man. I appreciate your concern.

232
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,200
I could have saved you a trip.
I'll take your action.

233
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,000
You take a dime each
on the Yankees and St. Louis?

234
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,200
Whoa, high roller.

235
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,800
I just got a three grand residual
on a That's Life episode.

236
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,000
What, that fake guinea-fest with Paul Sorvino?

237
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,200
That was totally unrealistic.

238
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,400
So dusty here.

239
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,200
- That silk?
- It ain't Kleenex. It's linen.

240
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,400
You know, you're very...

241
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,700
I don't know, you got a lot of class.

242
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,200
Just like your girlfriend.

243
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,000
He told me to look out for her
so I sent her some money. No one else did.

244
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,400
- So you keep his end for yourself?

245
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,100
I should give it to some trollop?
Besides, I thought I had it coming.

246
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,100
With Leotardo in the can,
who's been running that place, huh?

247
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,900
Collecting the rent, filing the taxes, all that?

248
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,200
What about my share?
All those years, I never saw a dime.

249
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,000
You're my father's friend, Hesh. My friend!

250
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,700
- So how come I never see you?
- What?

251
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,700
I see you. I'm fucking busy.

252
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,900
Never too busy to call me at two am
to hear your problems.

253
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,300
One time, that happened.
My therapist was on vacation.

254
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:14,600
You want his end, kid, you got it. It's
25 per cent. The closing is not for two weeks.

255
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:19,600
And I would appreciate it if you tell Leotardo
he should assume part of that burden.

256
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,600
Well, despite how you feel,
my father loved this woman.

257
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,800
She's not such a bad person,
but I don't know.

258
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,300
Something about her
always rubbed me the wrong way.

259
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,100
- Maybe cos she was rubbing him and not you.
- How long you know me, bub, huh?

260
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,400
She's a little pale for my taste.

261
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,700
Mr Patronella was last week.
This is a different one.

262
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,600
Yes, I'm aware
he's been to two funerals in a month.

263
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,200
Well, people die, Counselor.

264
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,000
The deceased in question now, Mrs Crilley,

265
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,500
was the sister of Mr Soprano's cousin.

266
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,500
By marriage.

267
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,400
So she's not a blood relative per se.

268
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,200
For God's sake,
the man wants to pay his respects.

269
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:18,000
Well, perhaps my next call should be
to Judge Runions.

270
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,400
Five hours, it's not a Hawaiian vacation.

271
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,600
He'll attend the church service
then pay his respects to the family.

272
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,800
Thank you, Counselor. We appreciate it.

273
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,500
You're worth every fucking cent!

274
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,200
They're gonna have
Scottish bagpipes at the funeral.

275
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,200
It should be interesting.

276
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,200
Don Provolone. See that fucking game?

277
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,400
- Diet Coke and whatever he's having.
- Ginger ale?

278
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,500
- Remind me to send Jeter a dozen roses.
- You wanna parlay it?

279
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,000
I was thinking I'd check out
that Indian casino, play some poker.

280
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,900
You want in a real game, I'll hook you up.

281
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,600
High stakes, exclusive clientele.

282
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,400
- David Lee Roth.
- I'll tell you, man.

283
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,000
Playing cards, games of chance,
I never really dug it before.

284
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:42,500
I was never that good at math. But there's
something about that excitement that's so...

285
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,600
I don't know.

286
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,800
What is wrong? I win a bet,
you look like you're gonna cry.

287
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,100
I fucked up again.

288
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,700
My super came by this morning
to fucking caulk around the toilet.

289
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,700
- He had some weed.
- You have got to call someone

290
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,800
before you use, not after.

291
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:06,200
I know, I know. I just wanted to see
if I could get high like a normal person.

292
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,800
You're not normal. Neither of us are.

293
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,600
On top of that,
you ask me to meet you at a bar?

294
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,900
Come here, you maniac.

295
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,200
625K for the track plus all that land? That's it?

296
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,300
Zoning restrictions.
We're lucky we got a buyer at all.

297
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,100
Here's what I propose...

298
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,300
Tony gets 150.

299
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,300
25 per cent comes from you,
the other 75 per cent of that comes from Hesh.

300
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,000
That's 40 grand.
You gotta be fucking kidding me, John.

301
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,600
Am I smiling?

302
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,500
You got some balls, kid, I'll give you that.

303
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,900
- You'll give me what I tell you to.
- Whoa.

304
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,400
- Take it easy.
- Fuck that!

305
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,000
This ain't the '70s. And I'm not a kid.

306
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,700
- Relax, it's an expression.
- Here's another one.

307
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,000
You got five days to give me my money.

308
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,800
Come on.

309
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,300
- That was out of line.
- Philly, he's a boss.

310
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,700
Jersey? Come on, huh?

311
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,100
Well, I talked to Phil and Hesh
about the racetrack.

312
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,400
How bad did they bullshit you?

313
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,800
Actually, we straightened it all out.

314
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,600
So when the sale goes through,
you're looking at a nice piece of change.

315
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,500
You're kidding?

316
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,100
Hey, that's wonderful.

317
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,200
I wanted to show you something.

318
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,500
You were admiring my handkerchief.

319
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,600
Check out the initials.

320
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,600
JFK? Holy shit! This was his?

321
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,800
You know, I have a hat of his.

322
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,300
A captain's hat I bought at an auction.

323
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,100
A lot of the friends don't like him,
you know, Ruby and all that shit.

324
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,300
- But, fuck, I was in grammar school.
- That's my lipstick.

325
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,900
We had a little thing.

326
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,200
- When he was president?
- March '61.

327
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,800
Right before the Bay of Pigs.

328
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,400
I was at the Copa with a girlfriend.

329
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,700
I'm wearing a new sable
and we meet Lem Billings.

330
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:39,200
Now, Lem is a school friend of Jack's
from Choate, but of course we had no idea.

331
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,000
He insists that we join him
for some affair at the Pierre Hotel.

332
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,000
He won't take no.

333
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,200
He has a limo, we figure, "What the hell?"

334
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,100
We go over and he tells us

335
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,400
he's taking us to the presidential suite.

336
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,900
So we get up, out of the elevator.

337
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:05,500
We go in the suite.
It is crawling with models, celebrities.

338
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,900
Peter Lawford, Sinatra.

339
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
- Jackie Gleason.
- No shit!

340
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,200
I'm looking around
and I glance across the room

341
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,800
and, suddenly, I am locking eyes

342
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,800
with John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

343
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,500
Yeah, he comes over.
He is a perfect gentleman.

344
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,900
He takes my coat,
he brings me a cocktail, introduces me around.

345
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,200
Finally, at the end of the night, and get this.

346
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,200
In the interests of national security, he says

347
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,600
he needs me to stay.

348
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,100
Since I'm wearing a sable,
he needs to personally interview me.

349
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,400
Make sure I'm not working for the Russians.

350
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,500
- He said that?
- Some line, huh?

351
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,300
- What was he like?
- Wonderful.

352
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,400
- So were you two an item?
- No. He called.

353
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,000
But after all, this man was the leader
of the free world. I mean, you know...

354
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:05,600
One weekend, I was supposed
to go down to DC, stay at the Ritz-Carlton.

355
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,000
Last minute, emergency meeting.

356
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,900
- Steel workers are going on strike.
- So it was just that one time?

357
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,100
You know, after the Bay of Pigs,
he was probably pretty busy.

358
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,400
Yeah, I knew there were others.

359
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,000
Judy Campbell and Marilyn, of course.

360
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,200
We had something special, though.
Crazy passion.

361
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,100
That was something
your mother never understood.

362
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,600
When you're married to a powerful man

363
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,000
you damn well better make him feel powerful.

364
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,800
My mother?

365
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,500
Please.

366
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,200
I saw a picture of Livia on New Year's Eve.

367
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,900
She was dressed like a refugee.

368
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,400
I think I'm going to skip the coffee.
I got a meeting in the city.

369
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,600
Are you sure?

370
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,200
Look...

371
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,100
Consider this an advance.

372
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,900
Get your phone turned on
and pay your rent.

373
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Your dad would be so proud.

374
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,300
He raised a real gentleman.

375
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,000
You trying to buy this pot?

376
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,500
800 and you'll know.

377
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
What the fuck.

378
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,100
Cowboys and three little Indians.

379
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,100
Fuck me!

380
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,900
I got a lot of big people
coming next week.

381
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,200
So when you write on TV, what do they have -

382
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,300
like one guy writes the words
for Dylan McDermott

383
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,100
and one guy writes
for Nicholson's girlfriend?

384
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,800
- You write it all yourself.
- Oh, interesting.

385
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,400
So how you doing? You wanna take off?

386
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,700
I'm getting killed here.

387
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,700
I'm gonna go. I'm fucking shot.

388
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:18,100
- I'll call you tomorrow. You wanna work out?
- Sure, yeah, whatever.

389
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,900
Four of clubs to Joe Hollywood,
jack for the car-wash king.

390
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,200
Ten for Mr Vito.

391
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,700
Show Valentina you love her!

392
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
They were out of the Citrucel.

393
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:10,300
- Where are you going?
- Gotta order some flowers.

394
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,800
Sal from the dry-cleaner, his kid died.

395
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,100
Drowned in a Jacuzzi.
Seven years old, you believe it?

396
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,100
Fucking tragedy.

397
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,700
- Harold Melvoin.
- It's me. I got another funeral. A kid.

398
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,000
His father does my shirts.

399
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,600
- It has to be a relative.
- It is a relative, goddamn it!

400
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,600
My old man came over
with his great-great-grandfather.

401
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,700
- Guy had a club foot.
- Isn't that rather tenuous?

402
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:51,000
The whole village of Avellino
settled in this area. We gotta be related.

403
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,200
- Corrado...
- Corrado, my balls!

404
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,100
I've gotta get out of here.
I'm going stir-crazy.

405
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
7th Street coming out.

406
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,500
Holy shit. You're still here?

407
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,200
- Called you all day.
- We're in a hand here.

408
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,600
- What do you wanna do?
- Fold.

409
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,900
Here, fuck it. I'm all in.

410
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,400
- Call.
- Pair of tens.

411
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,600
Flush. Caught it on the river.

412
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,000
Motherfucking...

413
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,100
fuck!

414
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,600
How bad?

415
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,500
- He owes the house 57.
- Thousand?

416
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,800
- What are you? Fucking crazy?
- Define crazy.

417
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:01,100
I'm good for it. I'm up for this Dick Wolf thing.
If I get on staff, it's a month's salary.

418
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,200
Well, how about this fucking month?

419
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,000
You think you could spot me for a while?

420
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,200
I got some child support, too.

421
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:19,000
I'll cover this, give you three grand
for incidentals. That's 60,000 altogether.

422
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:23,500
- I've only been up two days. I can still add.
- Good. Then add two points every week

423
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,200
- till I'm paid in full.
- You're charging me vig?

424
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,500
On top of the principal. It's compounded if
you're late. That's 1200 one week from today.

425
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,700
Don't give me that look.
This is your problem.

426
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,000
I will not fucking enable you.

427
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,300
There he is! Philly!

428
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,300
- Phil, where you going?
- I gotta meet John at the restaurant.

429
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,200
You fucking cocksucker!

430
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,200
Where you gonna go, huh?
Where you gonna go?

431
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,200
Motherfucker!

432
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,500
Jesus Christ. Mister, you OK in there?

433
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,900
- Oh, my neck!
- You all right?

434
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,000
You run from me, you cocksucker?

435
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,400
Where's my fucking money?

436
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,400
I'll get it. I'll get it. My neck, Tony.

437
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,400
- What? Do you think I'm an asshole?
- No.

438
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,400
- I can't hear you.
- No, no. Please, Tony.

439
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
You got 24 hours.

440
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,300
I called 911. They're on their way.
He's all right.

441
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,400
Oh, my God.

442
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,000
- Oh, my baby.
- Take her upstairs, Andy.

443
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,300
My baby...

444
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:44,700
She should take one of those
tranquillizers her mother gave her.

445
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,400
- We should go.
- Relax, we just got here.

446
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,700
Chicken's nice and spicy, huh?

447
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,100
I know you're in there.
You're casting a shadow over the peephole.

448
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,300
What? Are you ducking me?

449
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,000
I thought you were this girl.
She's a pain in the ass.

450
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,000
What the fuck? Where you been?

451
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,400
Working, man. I got those TV pitch meetings.

452
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,400
- I was gonna call you.
- Yeah, so why didn't you?

453
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,700
All right, look. You want the truth?
I was away. I went to AC.

454
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,400
- Where's my money?
- I don't have it yet.

455
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,900
But you went to AC.

456
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,300
I have a meeting next week with Rene Balcer.

457
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:06,500
Dick Wolf's right-hand guy. He likes my stuff.
He told my agent. I'm gonna be on staff.

458
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,600
I got out of that business
cos people fuck you over.

459
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,800
Jon Favreau?
Faggot cocksucker tried to steal my ideas.

460
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,200
I swear on all that's holy.
I'll have your money next week.

461
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,200
That wasn't the deal! I'll be back tomorrow.
Don't make me a jerkoff.

462
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,100
Damn, I'm happy. Get a load of these.

463
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,200
My new kicks. Bottega Veneta,
marked down to only 600.

464
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,200
- Thought you were paying your phone bill.
- Oh, I should've, I know.

465
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,500
But it's been so long
since I've been able to treat myself.

466
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,900
Oh, thanks.

467
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,400
So, turns out my Uncle Zio's going downhill.

468
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:01,900
The day we met, I told you we were at the
cemetery to bury his wife, my Aunt Concetta.

469
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,700
70 years, they were together.

470
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,100
Poor guy's taking it very hard.

471
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,600
Oh! My knight in shining armour!

472
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,100
So?

473
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,800
- Good morning to you, too.
- You got it?

474
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,300
Jesus, you are a fucking trip.

475
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,300
I'm JT by the way.

476
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,200
What is this? Pulp Fiction?
Am I supposed to be afraid?

477
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,900
I don't know. I didn't see it.

478
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
You're really being a prick.
I told you, I need more time.

479
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,000
- I don't have the money.
- Get it.

480
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,700
You know me. What could you do to me
that I haven't already been through?

481
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,400
I'm positive we'll think of something.

482
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:17,900
And 66 years after taking those sacred vows,
"till death do us part",

483
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,400
Concetta left him and went home to God.

484
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,600
In the two weeks that followed,
Nicolo struggled without her,

485
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,200
finally succumbing to irredeemable loss.

486
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,200
The enormity of his grief

487
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,600
can hardly be imagined.

488
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,100
How much they went through together -

489
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:42,200
seeing their children grow

490
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:47,200
and looking joyfully on
as their grandchildren had children.

491
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,200
Sickness and health,

492
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,300
good times and bad

493
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,400
but through it all, one thing remained constant.

494
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,900
They had each other.

495
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,400
It was Nicolo's love for Concetta
that made him leave this earth

496
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,700
a mere 15 days after she left him.

497
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,100
We take comfort
knowing they're together again,

498
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,200
seated at the foot of our Lord.

499
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,600
Let us join together in prayer.

500
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,500
Hail, Mary, full of Grace,

501
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,200
the Lord is with Thee.

502
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,300
Blessed art Thou among women

503
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,500
and blessed is the fruit of Thy womb, Jesus.

504
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,200
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

505
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,100
pray for us sinners,

506
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,100
now and at the hour of our death, amen.

507
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:39,000
- Junior, what's the matter?
- Oh, this fucking shit!

508
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
What's the point?

509
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,700
- Shh, Uncle Junior.
- I can't take it any more!

510
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,200
You need to lower your voice. Come on.

511
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,000
And forgive us our trespasses

512
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:56,000
as we forgive those who trespass against us.

513
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,400
It's a fucking Emmy.

514
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,500
It's gold-plated.

515
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,900
Then melt it down, man.

516
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,900
Look, I told you $15.

517
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,400
Fuck, man, come on!

518
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,900
This is like, huge, this shit.

519
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,600
If you had an Oscar,
maybe I could give you something.

520
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,800
An Academy Award. But TV?

521
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,900
- What else you got?
- I don't know.

522
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,800
I got a laptop in my car.

523
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,500
Yeah, OK, cool. I'll check that out.

524
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,200
From your friend. All 1200.

525
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:50,600
- He gave you a hard time?
- Hardest thing was keeping him awake.

526
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:55,200
- He's hitting the vein. Nodding out.
- Son of a fucking bitch.

527
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,200
Cheers.

528
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,700
I'm grilling us some filet mignon.

529
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,400
And you, take a load off.

530
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,500
This is the money
from the closing of the racetrack.

531
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,800
- It's 150 grand.
- That's great.

532
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,400
- How's your pal, Hesh?
- Good.

533
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:32,700
I remember once,
your dad and I drove down the shore.

534
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,300
Hesh had rented a place at Point Pleasant.
It was right before Labor Day.

535
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,800
Actually, it was a couple of months
before he died. We stopped at a liquor store.

536
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,300
He had to pee, I needed some cigarettes.

537
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,500
And anyway,
the man behind the counter was blind.

538
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,600
- Your dad looks at him...
- Wait a minute.

539
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:55,600
- This is after my dad got sick?
- Yeah.

540
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,400
My dad caught emphysema
and you kept smoking?

541
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,200
- He didn't mind.
- He could barely breathe.

542
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:06,500
We had the oxygen tent set up right
in the house. Jesus, even my mother quit.

543
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:11,600
I offered to stop. He didn't want me to.
He was fine with it, really.

544
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:16,300
All right, whatever. Finish your story.

545
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:20,400
It was dumb. Your dad got the guy
to give us some champagne.

546
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,700
Water chestnuts

547
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,000
wrapped in bacon.

548
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:39,200
And dip them in the duck sauce.

549
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,200
All right.

550
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,200
Delicious.

551
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,100
So, what's in the bag?

552
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,600
Yeah, I wanted to show you this.

553
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
It's the hat I told you about.

554
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,200
- JFK's.
- Oh, my goodness.

555
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,400
Look at this.

556
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
- May I?
- Yeah

557
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,400
I met with the Dick Wolf guy.

558
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,300
They hired some kid from Yale.

559
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,400
Plus, now the money I owe you

560
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,000
my ex-fucking-wife...

561
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,100
How many times have you shot up?

562
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,400
Five, six.

563
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,600
I thought I had it under control. I lost it.

564
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,300
You stupid fuck.

565
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,400
- You were doing so good. Now you fucked up.
- Where do you get the right?

566
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:39,400
We're in the programme.
Why didn't you call your sponsor?

567
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,400
- I couldn't get him.
- So why didn't you call me?

568
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,300
Yeah, but I don't fucking live with my mistress.

569
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,800
I mean, his fucking slippers?

570
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,700
Go on.

571
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,800
Well, when I left there, I...

572
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,300
started thinking about it.

573
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:12,000
When I was, I don't know, 16 years old -

574
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,300
my son's age -

575
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,800
I came home from school
to find a note from my Aunt Quin.

576
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:26,800
My mother had been pregnant
with another kid after my sister Barbara.

577
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,700
Change-of-life baby, they called it and...

578
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,100
Well, she started bleeding.

579
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,900
I was supposed get my father
over there ASAP.

580
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,500
I called every number I had.
I left messages all over town.

581
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:49,900
And finally, that night, about ten o'clock,

582
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:52,100
he called me back.

583
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,400
- Hello?
- Anthony, what's the matter?

584
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,300
Ma's in the hospital.

585
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:05,800
I think she was bleeding. The baby.

586
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,300
Jesus Christ.

587
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,900
Oh, shit!

588
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,900
- OK, pal.
- The lamb chops are gonna be overcooked.

589
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,200
I'm tied up, but I'm gonna get over
to the hospital right away.

590
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,100
He came and got me the next morning.

591
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,400
We went over to the hospital,

592
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,000
walked into her room.

593
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,700
- You're OK, baby, you're OK.
- No, you're OK!

594
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,700
Your life is just so wonderful and OK!

595
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,800
Lee...

596
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,900
Where were you last night?

597
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,700
I was at the Yankee game.

598
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,800
You were with that whore.

599
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:59,500
- What do you take me for? An idiot?
- No, Lee, that's not true!

600
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:02,400
I picked up Anthony from school,
we went to the game!

601
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,600
- Nicky gave us the tickets.
- You're a goddam liar.

602
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,800
I swear to God, Lee, the car broke down!

603
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,100
The timing belt!
We had to stay at Cousin Jimmy's.

604
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:18,400
Madonn', when we got home
and saw that note, I was worried sick.

605
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,600
Ask Anthony, you don't believe me.

606
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Where were you last night, Anthony?

607
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,600
We were at Cousin Jimmy's, Ma.

608
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,200
She could've fucking died

609
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,400
from a miscarriage.

610
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:01,000
- Fuck her.
- Was there any blame on his part?

611
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:04,000
This man you emulate?

612
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:07,800
The lies? The betrayals with other women?

613
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,200
Listen to me.

614
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:19,000
This is very important. Your mother
had her faults, but after all this time

615
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:21,600
what should we do with the old woman?

616
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,900
Have an auto-da-fé?

617
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,100
Burn her at the stake?

618
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,900
You need to forgive her and move on.

619
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,800
She made my father give my dog away.

620
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,100
I thought your father was a big, tough guy.

621
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,300
Probably didn't want to hear her bullshit
any more.

622
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,600
He gave my dog away
to his girlfriend's kid. Big deal.

623
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,100
If it was up to her,

624
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,600
she woulda had it killed.

625
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,700
All right, thanks.

626
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,500
Book value's 17 grand.
I'll knock that off the principal.

627
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,000
I fucking loved this car.

628
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,600
So you'll get another one.

629
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,800
Is that your sponsor?

630
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:40,000
I'll see you when you get out of rehab.
We'll figure out the rest of the payments.

631
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,800
You can do this, man. I have faith in you.

632
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:50,100
There's no chemical solution
to a spiritual problem.

633
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,200
It could've been another TIA. It's hard to tell.

634
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,600
Was any of this
accompanied by a lapse in memory?

635
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,700
I don't know.

636
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,600
Had you brought him earlier
I might have more answers.

637
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:26,000
That medicine stopped working.

638
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,800
I took more and it didn't do shit.

639
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,600
- I'm the walking dead.
- Medication's like cooking.

640
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,000
We may need to adjust the ingredients.

641
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:36,200
Who gives a shit? I'm so fucking blue.

642
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:42,100
What do you expect?
All you do is go to funerals all the time.

643
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,400
I'm trapped. What's the goddamn point?

644
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,600
Goddamn house arrest.

645
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,900
My life is only death.

646
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,100
I'm living in a grave.

647
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,300
I beat prison and for what?

648
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,400
I have no children.

649
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,500
Would somebody please explain this?

650
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:20,100
So, Hesh tells me you met your dad's goomah.

651
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,200
You had to see this woman in her prime.

652
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:33,400
- Nice, huh?
- Nice?

653
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:38,000
- She was JFK's girlfriend for three years.
- No shit!

654
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,200
- I remember hearing about her.
- Fucking knockout. Beautiful, classy.

655
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:46,500
JFK, huh? How do you like that?

656
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:52,600
He had her up to the White House
on the weekends, when his wife was away.

657
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,100
This woman was like a... like a princess.

658
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,400
I'll tell you what.

659
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:12,000
For a while there, Jackie Kennedy
thought the marriage was over.

660
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,600
English
