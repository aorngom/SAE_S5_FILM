1
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:11,311
You woke up this morning

2
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:14,781
got yourself a gun

3
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:19,152
your mama always said
you'd be the chosen one

4
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:21,654
she said
you're one in a million

5
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:24,657
you've got to burn
to shine

6
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:26,659
but you were
born under a bad sign

7
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:30,163
with a blue moon
in your eyes

8
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:32,165
when you woke up
this mornin'

9
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:35,552
all that love had gone

10
00:00:35,552 --> 00:00:39,923
your papa never told you
about right and wrong

11
00:00:40,423 --> 00:00:43,560
but you're, but you're
looking good, baby

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,929
i believe that
you're a- feelin' fine

13
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:48,431
shame about it
born under a bad sign

14
00:00:48,932 --> 00:00:52,569
with a blue moon in your eyes
so sing it now

15
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:57,690
woke up this morning
you got a blue moon
got a blue moon in your eyes?
?

16
00:00:58,074 --> 00:01:00,076
Yeah

17
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:05,331
you say you
woke up this morning

18
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,333
the world turned
upside down

19
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,702
lord above, things ain't
been the same

20
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:13,590
since the blues
walked into town

21
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,844
but you're, but you're
one in a million'cause you
got that shotgun shine

22
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:21,347
shame about it
born under a bad sign

23
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:25,101
with a blue moon
in your eyes, yeah

24
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:28,104
woke up this morning

25
00:01:28,104 --> 00:01:30,607
got yourself a gun

26
00:01:30,607 --> 00:01:33,109
got yourself a gun

27
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:35,111
got yourself a gun

28
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,488
talk it through.
Talk it through the opening.

29
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:48,491
Little left.
Little left on your end.

30
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:50,493
All right!

31
00:01:53,997 --> 00:01:55,999
Open the door!
Any hinky shit,

32
00:01:56,499 --> 00:01:59,886
and you'll be refrying beans
with pablo escobar again.

33
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,260
This is all a message
to your friends.
Stay away from port newark.

34
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,397
Don't even drive
out to jersey.
Not even on sundays.

35
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:15,768
I'll tell them.
They've been told.
Twice.

36
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:17,770
Now i'll tell them.

37
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:22,659
Here.

38
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:26,162
Holy shit.
Ha, ha.
Bingo!

39
00:02:26,162 --> 00:02:28,164
We can't fit
all this shit
in the carton.

40
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:31,167
Fuckin' crackheads
and their small bills.

41
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:37,290
This is just a little token
of my appreciation....

42
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,292
for recommending
dr. Melfi.

43
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:42,795
She's a good shrink.
I'm not always
a model patient--

44
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:46,799
what, what?
You didn't have to.
These are monte cristos.

45
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,802
These are cuban.
Yeah, they're
the best, right?

46
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:53,306
- They're illegal, aren't they?
- They're cigars.

47
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:56,309
Oh, they're dreamy, ton'.

48
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,311
You're a good
neighbor, bruce.

49
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:02,315
Hey, look, i'm a doctor.
I make referrals all the time,
tony. You don't have to--

50
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:05,818
- no biggie.
- I bet these motherfuckers
were hard to come by.

51
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:08,321
Yeah, they fell off
a truck.

52
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:11,324
Excuse me.

53
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,460
- Hello?
- It's done.

54
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:16,212
And it's the biggest
fucking refrigerator
you've ever seen.

55
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:18,715
How about
the other thing?

56
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:21,217
Juan valdez has been
separated from his donkey.

57
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,840
You know, ton',
i've been meaning to say,

58
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,342
i've been watching you
out back with your putter.

59
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:34,597
You ever play at the club?
No, i play minnisink,
the public course.

60
00:03:34,597 --> 00:03:38,601
You know, you ought
to come to the club
and play sometime.

61
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:41,104
Nah, you know, it's--
come on.

62
00:03:41,104 --> 00:03:43,606
It's a wicked back nine.
And besides,
some of the members,

63
00:03:43,606 --> 00:03:45,608
i think you'd like them
very much.

64
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:48,111
Yeah, maybe, you know.

65
00:03:48,111 --> 00:03:50,113
We'll see.

66
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:51,998
Here we go.

67
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:55,501
Fresh champagne,
gentlemen.
Oh, that's beautiful.

68
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:59,005
I love a mixed salad.
I can stare
at it for hours.

69
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,507
A score like this happens
once in a lifetime.

70
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:04,010
Gotta make this work for us
out in the open, legit.

71
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,013
Find a nice i. P. O.
Keep it spinning.
Live off the juice.

72
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,882
- I. P. -- who?
- Go on in.

73
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:12,635
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I. P. O. -- initial
public offering.

74
00:04:13,136 --> 00:04:16,139
Stock. We gotta find
some insider market
trading shit.

75
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,141
Understand?
Where's my baby?

76
00:04:18,141 --> 00:04:22,145
Paulie, baby,
get that big dick
in the jacuzzi now.

77
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:25,148
Whoa- ho!
Whoo!

78
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,784
Taking off.

79
00:04:28,284 --> 00:04:31,788
We're gonna celebrate,
just me and adriana.
Mother of mercy.

80
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:34,791
Could this be
the end of rico?
Maybe.

81
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,410
Just maybe.

82
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,413
Have fun.
Say hello to the broad.
Say hello to your girl for me.

83
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:43,916
Thank you so much
for taking me to the theater.

84
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,553
Rent.

85
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,555
Fuckin'
broadway musicals.

86
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,557
I mean, we're all
supposed to get all
fuckin' weepy- eyed...

87
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:54,060
'cause they turned off
the heat in some guy's loft?

88
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,562
I'm hummin' the scenery,
chrissy.

89
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:59,565
Fifth- row, center,
and dinner at la cirque?

90
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:01,567
Yeow!

91
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,569
I'm embarrassed
to be hungry again.

92
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,571
Thank you.

93
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:09,075
Let's just say,
after how many years
with tony soprano's crew,

94
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,577
some shit has finally
worked out.

95
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:15,081
Just when i was starting
to wonder if, you know--

96
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:19,836
whose fuckin' welfare check
you gotta cash to get
a burger around here?

97
00:05:19,836 --> 00:05:21,838
Shut the fuck up!

98
00:05:21,838 --> 00:05:25,708
Wouldn't it be cool
to own a restaurant
like la cirque?

99
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:28,711
Come on with the careers.

100
00:05:28,711 --> 00:05:33,216
- That black guy over there--
he look familiar?
- You have my money.

101
00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:36,219
Why don't you just
forget about workin'
and be with me?

102
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:40,223
Oh, yeah. And be
one of those wives
like carmela soprano?

103
00:05:40,723 --> 00:05:43,226
Breast- feed a bunch of rugrats
and then spend the rest
of your life...

104
00:05:43,226 --> 00:05:45,728
at the gym, just you
and your stretch marks.

105
00:05:45,728 --> 00:05:47,730
You're right.

106
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,733
Cousin's always had a brain,
but what does she use it for?

107
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:53,736
A husband who can't
even tell you where
the money comes from.

108
00:05:54,237 --> 00:05:57,240
Yo, hair net central,
what am i back here,
mark fuhrman?

109
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,992
You a dick!
- Would you chill?

110
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:01,994
It's fuckin'
discrimination already.

111
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,497
Hey.

112
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,499
'Bout time.

113
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,647
Bold men make
bold statements.

114
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:25,651
Why'd they send you over?
I'm lookin' for a burger,
not converted rice.

115
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:29,272
- Your woman looks embarrassed. -

116
00:06:33,276 --> 00:06:37,280
come on, eh?
Give me a couple
of burger baskets.

117
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:43,786
He's only bold
because he's semi- hooked up
with the tony soprano crew.

118
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:51,294
What's with the attitude,
christopher?

119
00:06:51,294 --> 00:06:53,296
If it's not the blacks,
it's somebody else.

120
00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:56,299
Whoa!
Nice.

121
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,684
Must belong to the homie
with the blue hat.

122
00:06:58,801 --> 00:07:01,804
Yo!
Donnie brasco!

123
00:07:01,804 --> 00:07:03,806
Yeah?

124
00:07:03,806 --> 00:07:07,310
My name is orange j.
I'm down with massive genius.

125
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,313
That's who it was.
That gangsta rapper.

126
00:07:10,313 --> 00:07:12,315
I told you to shut up.

127
00:07:12,315 --> 00:07:14,317
We're having a party
at g's crib.

128
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:17,320
Englewood cliffs.
You interested?

129
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,323
And i get served
with black- eyed peas
tomorrow?

130
00:07:20,823 --> 00:07:24,327
I know what time it is.
Massive's heard of
the fuckin' crew you with.

131
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:26,829
There's business
to be done.

132
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:08,871
This is a beautiful,
beautiful home.

133
00:08:08,871 --> 00:08:12,375
Smaller than my hamptons crib,
but that's bigger than steven's.

134
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:15,011
That's italian contractors,
obviously.

135
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:18,014
Look at all these
gold records!

136
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,767
Whoa!
What do we have here?

137
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,642
You like that shit?

138
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,146
A christmas present
to myself.

139
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:38,150
Isn't that
a sight to behold?

140
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:43,656
I do so love a good
firearm in my hand.

141
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,801
You people are
all right.

142
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:59,305
Godfather?
I seen that movie
200 times.

143
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,808
Godfather iiwas
definitely the shit.

144
00:09:02,925 --> 00:09:05,928
The third one--
a lot of people
didn't like it,

145
00:09:05,928 --> 00:09:09,432
but i think it was
just misunderstood.

146
00:09:12,435 --> 00:09:14,937
So what kind of business
you want to discuss?

147
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:27,199
Mr. Herman rabkin.
Hesh.

148
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:30,202
I don't know him personally,
but i know his history.

149
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:33,706
In the late'50s and'60s,
he owned f- note records.

150
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:36,709
I don't know what
it was called, but, yeah,
hesh was in the music business.

151
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,211
Little situation here.

152
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:41,714
A distant- but- deceased
quasi- cousin
on my mother's side--

153
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,716
little jimmy willis;
'50s legend--

154
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,218
two seminal hit records
was his legacy--

155
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:49,722
drug tragedy.
"Such a fool"--

156
00:09:49,972 --> 00:09:52,975
oh, i love that.
They play it all the time
on oldies radio.

157
00:09:53,476 --> 00:09:56,479
Old herman?
He's just another
in a long line...

158
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,482
of white motherfuckers
stealing royalties
from the black man...

159
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:01,484
that made them the money
in the first place.

160
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:05,237
Jimmy's mother out
in san bernardino
who i call my aunt...

161
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:08,124
is owed that money.

162
00:10:08,624 --> 00:10:10,626
Hesh is the world's
sweetest guy,

163
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:13,629
but i've heard his opinions
on givin' back pieces
of israel.

164
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:16,499
I can only imagine
what he's gonna say
about this shit.

165
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:18,501
Feel free
to enjoy the food...

166
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:21,003
and any other enjoyments.

167
00:10:24,507 --> 00:10:26,509
Champagne, sir, ma'am?

168
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:29,845
Yeah.

169
00:10:32,848 --> 00:10:36,352
That guy's a gangster?
I'm a gangster.

170
00:10:36,352 --> 00:10:40,356
I'm an o. G. Original
gangster, not him,
fuckin' lawn jockey.

171
00:10:40,356 --> 00:10:43,359
And he's got the fly
hamptons house,

172
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,746
alec baldwin comes over,
whitney houston--

173
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:50,750
what do i got?
I sit in the fucking
pork store, for christ sake.

174
00:10:50,866 --> 00:10:54,370
But the moolies,
they got it goin' on,
and they're on tv.

175
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:59,375
- They don't take no shit.
- Soprano crew, it's always
"secret this, omertathat."

176
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,377
Fuckin' gets on my nerves.

177
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:04,263
Junior, with his
moldy old sweaters,
and he's a fuckin' boss.

178
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,767
And you were just feeling
so good about yourself.

179
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:11,270
Our thing once ruled
the music business.
Did you know that?

180
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:15,274
No.
We bankrolled acts.
Blacks, everybody.

181
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:18,778
Paid the deejays or busted
heads to get em' played
on the air.

182
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,280
There was some great
italian singers.
Fuckin' a.

183
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,783
Frankie valli.
Dion. The rascals.

184
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:25,785
That whole philly thing.

185
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:28,788
My dad used to talk
about those guys.

186
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,907
Now?
Fuckin' drum machines,
some ignorant poetry,

187
00:11:31,907 --> 00:11:35,411
and every fuckin'
fourth- grade dropout ditsoon
is chairman of the board.

188
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,799
- Gangsters.
-

189
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:43,803
talk aboutpaisanpride.
Go joey!
Shot to the heart

190
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,806
and you're to blame
you give love

191
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:50,059
a bad name
bad name

192
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:08,444
oh, you're home.
Hey.

193
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:11,580
Barb wagner called.
Remember her from
the fund- raiser?

194
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:15,701
- The mayonaisses up the street?
- They invited us to a barbecue
over at their house.

195
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:21,457
All right.
Didn't think so.

196
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,463
Are you still
with the brochures?

197
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:30,466
Can you believe how much
it costs for a college
education for four years?

198
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,852
We got enough.

199
00:12:33,102 --> 00:12:35,604
I know we got enough,
but how much is enough?

200
00:12:35,604 --> 00:12:39,108
I mean, god forbid, what if
something should happen?

201
00:12:39,108 --> 00:12:41,110
You dig up my blue suit.
You call up old man coletti.

202
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,112
You tell him not to put
too much makeup on my face.

203
00:12:43,112 --> 00:12:46,115
Don't joke around
about this, tony.

204
00:12:46,115 --> 00:12:49,618
You'll be taken care of.
You're always telling
me the same thing.

205
00:12:49,618 --> 00:12:51,620
I'll be taken care of.
By who?

206
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,623
What is with the look?

207
00:12:54,623 --> 00:12:56,625
Did you just make a score?

208
00:12:56,625 --> 00:13:00,129
No. I wish.

209
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:04,133
You know, tony,
it's a multiple- choice
thing with you.

210
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:06,635
I can't tell
if you're old- fashioned,

211
00:13:06,635 --> 00:13:08,637
you're paranoid...

212
00:13:08,637 --> 00:13:10,639
or just
a fuckin' asshole.

213
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,895
So what do i tell the wagners
about this barbecue?

214
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,898
You want to go?
Sure.

215
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:24,153
Cusamano asked me to play
a little golf with him
at his club.

216
00:13:24,153 --> 00:13:26,155
Sorry.
All right. Fine.

217
00:13:33,162 --> 00:13:37,166
Prick. The maitre d' is
really on the rag tonight.

218
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:40,669
I'll talk to him.

219
00:13:40,669 --> 00:13:43,172
Remember richie santini?
Yeah, you used to fuck him.

220
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:45,174
That really
sums it up.

221
00:13:45,174 --> 00:13:48,177
I knew him
since we were three.
He lived next door.

222
00:13:48,177 --> 00:13:51,180
Yeah, we had
our little phase.

223
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,183
What about him?
You've heard his band.

224
00:13:54,183 --> 00:13:57,686
Defiler?
I'm not into that
headbangin' shit.

225
00:13:58,187 --> 00:14:00,189
You were talkin' about
the good old days.

226
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:02,691
Italians running
the music business.

227
00:14:02,691 --> 00:14:05,194
And here's richie,
this musician who you know.

228
00:14:05,194 --> 00:14:07,696
They're not
a hair band anymore,
and they're really good.

229
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:12,201
You said yourself
how much money
there was in this thing.

230
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:15,704
You mean like, uh,
richie santini?

231
00:14:17,706 --> 00:14:20,209
You think massive genius
would be interested?

232
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:23,212
It's a whole
different thing: Black.

233
00:14:23,712 --> 00:14:26,215
But he's got a company.
Massive g productions.

234
00:14:26,215 --> 00:14:29,218
Shit, they make
movies, even.

235
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:33,222
Massive does owe me
a favor.

236
00:14:33,222 --> 00:14:36,225
I'm arranging a sit- down
for him with hesh.

237
00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:39,228
I was thinking about--
okay.

238
00:14:39,228 --> 00:14:41,230
I know this sounds
kind of funny.

239
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,732
Music management.

240
00:14:43,732 --> 00:14:45,734
Huh.
And working here,

241
00:14:45,734 --> 00:14:47,736
i have met people,
important people.

242
00:14:47,736 --> 00:14:51,240
Learned people skills.
Had to deal with big egos.

243
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,242
Solved problems.

244
00:14:53,242 --> 00:14:55,744
And with my love
of all kinds of music--

245
00:14:58,747 --> 00:15:01,250
maybe alec baldwin would
come to our house.

246
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,625
You know who we are
you know what we do

247
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:13,128
we're comin' to defile
defile you

248
00:15:13,128 --> 00:15:16,131
stay out of our way
and don't be so gay

249
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:20,135
we're comin' to defile
defile you

250
00:15:23,138 --> 00:15:27,142
my- y- y lord

251
00:15:28,644 --> 00:15:32,398
- it's just an old demo.
- No. You know what?

252
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,402
Fuck it.
Let's set you up.

253
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:39,405
What?
I got money.

254
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:43,409
You're right. With how much
you listen to the radio,
you'd be good.

255
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:48,414
I can't believe it!
But i get to pick
what you wear.

256
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:51,417
Dress you up.
I like that.

257
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,435
This place has
the flava.
That gelding,

258
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,937
name is sidney.

259
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,940
So how come you never wrote
a song about him?

260
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:20,446
When you and little jimmy
were writing partners
on all his hits,

261
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:24,450
did you write the music
and him the lyrics,
or the other way around?

262
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,453
We, uh, we had
our own process.

263
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:31,707
So that "ooh, wacka- do,
wacka- dooley- do,
i'm so blue,"

264
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:34,710
that spring from
your experience,
or the little brother's?

265
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,713
One could write a song
about a horse.

266
00:16:37,713 --> 00:16:40,215
But in order for it to be
a hit with your target audience,

267
00:16:40,215 --> 00:16:44,219
he'd have to have a mounted
cop on him and ripped up the ass
with a mac ten, no?

268
00:16:45,721 --> 00:16:48,223
So you bought horses
with your royalties.

269
00:16:48,223 --> 00:16:50,726
And little jimmy's royalties,
whatever became of those?

270
00:16:50,726 --> 00:16:53,228
He bought horse.

271
00:16:53,228 --> 00:16:55,864
Music business back then,
we were breaking all the rules.

272
00:16:55,864 --> 00:16:57,866
Makin"em, breakin"em
as we went along.

273
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,869
You mean rapin'
and pillagin'.

274
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,621
Things haven't changed
much, huh?

275
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,124
Were we hard- nosed?
Yeah.

276
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,626
But we gave a lot
of kids their start.
A lot of negro youth.

277
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:11,747
Took'em out of the ghetto,
kids with talent,
put'em on the stage.

278
00:17:11,747 --> 00:17:14,750
Herman, ordinarily,
i'd be more than happy...

279
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,252
to stroll down
memory lane with you.

280
00:17:17,252 --> 00:17:20,139
But it's reparations
that i seek.

281
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,141
Why don't we call this
what it is: A shakedown.

282
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:25,144
Your own father
was a silent partner
in f- note records.

283
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:29,148
Made sure that
the records got airplay,
isn't that right?

284
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:32,651
Yeah, that money
built my house
on the jersey shore.

285
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,653
What do you want to do,
hesh? I'm guided by you.

286
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,156
- He's got to do the right
thing, that's what.
- Ohh!

287
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,158
Hey. You're way
our of line, kid.

288
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,660
Let's get some cold fucking
fizzy water on your head.

289
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,918
Thank you, jen.
Let's get right
to the point, huh?

290
00:17:49,918 --> 00:17:52,037
What's in this for you?

291
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:54,540
If you read
chuck d's book,

292
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,042
you know he advises
that reparations be made...

293
00:17:57,042 --> 00:18:00,045
by the jewish studio moguls
in hollywood...

294
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,048
on account of the way
black folks have been
portrayed in film.

295
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:06,051
Now, that's only germane to
this argument inasmuch...

296
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:10,055
as i feel that the grievances
in the music business
are far worse.

297
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:13,058
You're talking to the wrong
white man, my friend.

298
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:15,561
My people were the white man's
nigger when yours were still...

299
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,563
painting their faces
and chasing zebras.

300
00:18:17,946 --> 00:18:22,317
And as far as louie b. Mayer
is concerned, what are you,
fucking nuts?

301
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,955
My lawyers have done
a little research.

302
00:18:26,955 --> 00:18:29,708
I think that the final figure
is somewhere around...

303
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,961
four hundred thousand dollars.

304
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:39,218
Now, a cashier's check
made to mrs. Idella willis...

305
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,220
will set
the record straight.

306
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,839
Or what?

307
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,095
What was it
that she called him?

308
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:52,598
Oh, yeah.

309
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:56,101
"That nice man,"
i think she said.

310
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,614
So how's your neighbor,
the one with no neck?

311
00:19:08,864 --> 00:19:12,367
The sopranos? Well, there's
a new car in the driveway
every other week,

312
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:14,369
but besides that--

313
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:17,873
he gave me a gift
of some excellent
cuban cigars.

314
00:19:17,873 --> 00:19:20,125
- And you accepted them?
- Mmm- hmm.

315
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,377
See? Eroding
the neighborhood values.

316
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:24,513
He was thanking me
for referring him
to a physician,

317
00:19:24,513 --> 00:19:26,515
which he's very happy with.

318
00:19:26,515 --> 00:19:29,017
Really?

319
00:19:29,017 --> 00:19:31,637
What does that do
to property values,

320
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,639
having a gangster
living next door?

321
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:36,775
Are you kidding? Safest block
in the neighborhood.

322
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,778
- And bein' a gangster--
what does that mean, anyway?
- Yeah, that's true.

323
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,781
Some of the shit i see
in the boardroom, i don't know
if i'd make a distinction.

324
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,901
Oh, will you please?
It's not the same thing.

325
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:48,654
Bugging? Bribes?
I don't know.

326
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:52,658
Sometimes i think the only
thing separating the american
business from the mobs...

327
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,159
is fuckin' whackin'
somebody.

328
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,163
Listen to you.
Whackin'.
What?

329
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,666
He hangs around
with tony soprano
for 15 minutes...

330
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,168
and it's "fuckin'" this
and "fuckin'" that.

331
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,805
We were over there
for that fund- raiser.

332
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,308
I didn't see
any guns anywhere.

333
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,811
Oh, but that bar
with the goombah
murano glass?

334
00:20:15,564 --> 00:20:17,566
I like murano glass.

335
00:20:21,436 --> 00:20:23,939
Those monte cristos?

336
00:20:23,939 --> 00:20:26,441
What do you say?
After dinner?

337
00:20:29,945 --> 00:20:33,949
Just jaded
tired and bored

338
00:20:37,953 --> 00:20:41,707
right or wrong
i ain't strong

339
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:46,712
like i used to be

340
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,847
i want to

341
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:53,352
erase myself

342
00:21:04,613 --> 00:21:06,615
i know it ain't
your type of music,
but--

343
00:21:07,115 --> 00:21:10,118
i like any kind of music
that turns shit green.

344
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,623
Richie's been through
a lot. It's deep
in his writing.

345
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,625
As a metal band,
they were fuckin' great.

346
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,628
But this, as far
as i am concerned,
blows away matchbox 20.

347
00:21:19,628 --> 00:21:23,131
- What do they all themselves?
- Used to be defiler.

348
00:21:23,632 --> 00:21:26,635
Then some personnel changes--
bass and drums.

349
00:21:26,635 --> 00:21:29,137
But richie and vito are still
the core of the band.

350
00:21:29,638 --> 00:21:31,640
Now they're called
visiting day.

351
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,142
Mom and dad

352
00:21:34,142 --> 00:21:39,147
had left me down

353
00:21:39,147 --> 00:21:41,149
and now i want to

354
00:21:41,149 --> 00:21:45,153
erase myself

355
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,522
this is some loud shit.

356
00:21:47,522 --> 00:21:53,528
Oh, we are alone

357
00:21:53,528 --> 00:21:57,532
yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah

358
00:21:57,532 --> 00:21:59,534
whoo!

359
00:21:59,534 --> 00:22:05,290
- Take me away
- that's richie.

360
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,295
And that's vito.
I don't want

361
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:13,799
to stay

362
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:19,554
- fuck you!
- Sit the fuck down,
you mullethead.

363
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,813
This isn't the right place
for them.

364
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,318
You suck!

365
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:35,821
You know, without
the right help from you,

366
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,457
visiting day could end up
in the miscellaneous
"v" section.

367
00:22:42,711 --> 00:22:46,832
Don't be sad
it's not bad

368
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:51,837
- nobody cares
- you interested?

369
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:57,342
I want to
erase myself
yes!

370
00:23:00,228 --> 00:23:03,231
That scene where pesci
sticks the guy's head
in a vise,

371
00:23:03,231 --> 00:23:06,735
and then he fuckin' pops
his eye out-- i mean,
i thought i was gonna die.

372
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,742
I'll be right back,
okay?

373
00:23:15,243 --> 00:23:18,246
Excuse me.
It's this way, right?

374
00:23:18,246 --> 00:23:20,248
Yes.
Thank you.

375
00:24:00,288 --> 00:24:03,291
I don't know.
What?

376
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:07,295
Richie. Guy's 30,
still lives with his parents.

377
00:24:07,295 --> 00:24:09,297
It's because of
the accident.

378
00:24:09,297 --> 00:24:12,300
Richie had third- degree
burns from trying
to grill that trout...

379
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,803
with a downed
power line.

380
00:24:14,803 --> 00:24:18,807
At the same time,
being electrocuted
turned his life around.

381
00:24:20,308 --> 00:24:22,811
Well, you did some
ace fucking selling.

382
00:24:22,811 --> 00:24:24,813
You think?

383
00:24:24,813 --> 00:24:26,815
Yeah.
Thing is, though,

384
00:24:26,815 --> 00:24:30,819
music is not something
you can hold in your hands,
you know,

385
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:34,823
like football betting cards
or coke.

386
00:24:35,824 --> 00:24:37,826
It's art.

387
00:24:37,826 --> 00:24:41,830
Berry gordy, whatever,
he had to see it
in the supremes.

388
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,832
It's an instinct.

389
00:24:43,832 --> 00:24:45,834
I see it in richie.

390
00:24:45,834 --> 00:24:48,336
Yeah.
Probably is.

391
00:24:49,838 --> 00:24:51,840
I'm really fuckin'
doin' it!

392
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,342
And it's all
thanks to you.

393
00:24:55,844 --> 00:24:58,346
I got to make a demo cd,
like massive advised,

394
00:24:58,346 --> 00:25:00,298
and then-- yeah!

395
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:02,517
My wife thinks i need
to meet new people.

396
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,387
So?
Come on. You're italian.
You understand.

397
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:09,274
Guys like me, we're brought up
to think themeddigan
are fuckin' bores.

398
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:12,777
The truth is,
the average white man
is no more boring...

399
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:17,782
than the millionth conversation
over who should have won,
marciano or ali.

400
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:20,285
So am i to understand that you
don't consider yourself white?

401
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,287
I don't mean white,
like caucasian.

402
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:26,791
I mean a white man,
like our friend, cusamano.

403
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:29,294
Now, he's italian,
but he's ameddigan.

404
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:31,796
He's what my old man woulda
called the wonder bread wop.

405
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,299
Eats his sunday gravy
out of a jar.

406
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:37,302
You seem to want
to branch out.

407
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:40,672
What's stopping you?
The guys.

408
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:45,810
What they'd think
if i started hanging out
with themeddigan.

409
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,824
I was in your neighborhood
last night, at the cusamano's.

410
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:06,331
- Oh, yeah?
- Dinner party.

411
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,835
Shoulda stopped by.

412
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:13,338
Live right next door.

413
00:26:20,462 --> 00:26:24,466
You didn't hear any
strange noises last night
in your neighborhood?

414
00:26:25,967 --> 00:26:27,969
Noises?

415
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:30,472
Like someone
screaming in pain?

416
00:26:31,973 --> 00:26:34,476
Uh, no.

417
00:26:34,976 --> 00:26:37,479
Probably
a television set.

418
00:26:41,983 --> 00:26:44,986
You saw my house?
Mm- hmm.

419
00:26:54,996 --> 00:26:57,499
Oh!
This looks good.

420
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:02,387
Mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm.
That sausage, huh,
where'd you get it?

421
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:06,391
- Little place in garfield?
- Honey, where'd we get
the sausage?

422
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:08,393
That little place
in garfield.
You know,

423
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:10,395
the only thing better
than a little sausage
is a pair of tits.

424
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:13,898
I don't know about that,
but it's a hell
of a piece of meat.

425
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:16,901
Sausage is kind of
a phallic thing.

426
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:18,903
Whereas tits--

427
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:25,777
so, jack, you're
a stockbroker, right?
Mmm.

428
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:28,279
Any changes
in the market comin'?

429
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:31,032
They're always changing.
That's what keeps us
coming back.

430
00:27:33,535 --> 00:27:36,538
Oh, by the way, rand,
you hear from ross
on dexplex?

431
00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:39,541
No, not yet,
but the buyout is
definitely goin' down.

432
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:41,793
Just give me a little
warning. I need
to call the islands.

433
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:44,546
Dexplex?

434
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:52,554
Oh, it's a little company.
It's going public, maybe.

435
00:27:52,554 --> 00:27:55,190
Hey, hey. Come on.
Come on, will ya?

436
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,192
The sun is shining.
It's a beautiful day.

437
00:27:57,192 --> 00:27:59,694
Let's not talk business
for once, huh?

438
00:27:59,694 --> 00:28:02,197
American biotics.

439
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:04,315
Barb, our stock guru.

440
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:07,068
She thinks american biotics
may be a good investment.

441
00:28:07,068 --> 00:28:11,072
It's supposed to be close
to a side- effect- free
anti- impotence drug.

442
00:28:11,072 --> 00:28:14,075
You guys play
the stock market?
We don't just play.

443
00:28:15,076 --> 00:28:17,579
We win.

444
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,972
Friends say i'm crazy

445
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:30,975
she's gonna make me cry

446
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:33,478
but none of them know
the way we

447
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:36,481
steal a little kiss
and my, oh, my

448
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:38,983
fools follow angels

449
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:42,353
wanna believe she's mine
all mine alone

450
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:45,857
why am i such a fool

451
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,622
friends say i'm crazy

452
00:29:01,122 --> 00:29:04,125
she's gonna make me cry

453
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:06,628
but none of them know
the way we

454
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:10,265
steal a little kiss
and, oh, my

455
00:29:10,265 --> 00:29:12,267
fools follow angels

456
00:29:12,267 --> 00:29:15,270
wanna believe she's mine
all mine alone

457
00:29:15,637 --> 00:29:19,140
why am i such a fool

458
00:29:19,641 --> 00:29:23,144
erase myself

459
00:29:25,647 --> 00:29:29,150
are we alone

460
00:29:31,653 --> 00:29:33,655
yeah, yeah

461
00:29:33,655 --> 00:29:35,657
yeah, yeah

462
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:44,415
take me away

463
00:29:47,302 --> 00:29:51,055
i don't want to stay

464
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,061
there must be

465
00:29:57,562 --> 00:30:02,066
another way

466
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:18,199
that's take 62.

467
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:21,336
We oughta just bag it.

468
00:30:28,843 --> 00:30:30,845
Okay. We're baggin' it.

469
00:30:30,845 --> 00:30:33,848
We shoulda bagged this
two days ago when it was
fucking perfect.

470
00:30:33,848 --> 00:30:36,851
I wish i had
thought of that.

471
00:30:39,721 --> 00:30:42,724
It's good.
You know, not bad.

472
00:30:42,724 --> 00:30:44,726
I think it's as good
as we're gonna get
right now.

473
00:30:44,726 --> 00:30:47,729
Oh, it wasn't too bad.
It was kind of good.

474
00:30:47,729 --> 00:30:50,231
Hey.

475
00:30:50,231 --> 00:30:53,234
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you saying?
Is something wrong?

476
00:30:53,234 --> 00:30:55,236
No, i'm sure
we're all trying
our best here.

477
00:30:55,236 --> 00:30:57,739
I just think
we hit a brick wall.

478
00:30:57,739 --> 00:31:00,742
Maybe some rest.

479
00:31:00,742 --> 00:31:02,744
Hey, hey, fuck that!

480
00:31:02,744 --> 00:31:05,246
I paid for three days'
studio time already.

481
00:31:05,246 --> 00:31:08,750
It's only gonna cost me
more money to pack it up
and come in again, isn't it?

482
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:12,503
I don't get it. We got through
the instrumental tracks
with no problem.

483
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:15,006
Ah, i'm fuckin' beat.

484
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:19,010
What do you say we finish
this shit? Three days now
we been slammin' our hams.

485
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:22,263
Look,
kinkos gave me five days off.
It's not the end of the world.

486
00:31:22,263 --> 00:31:25,767
Kinko's?
Buddy, this is costing me
300 bucks an hour.

487
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:27,769
Here. Try this.

488
00:31:30,772 --> 00:31:34,776
Dude, i don't do drugs
anymore, okay?

489
00:31:35,276 --> 00:31:37,779
Well, hats off.
But for all the dynamic
excitement in these songs,

490
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:40,782
maybe we should get another
downed power line in here,
let you suck on it.

491
00:31:41,282 --> 00:31:43,167
- Christopher!
- What you just heard...

492
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:45,169
was our balls- out,
most introspective song.

493
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,673
- It's not supposed to rock.
-
it'll be our first single.

494
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:51,793
No, dude, second.
"Sharon's chair" will be
the one that busts out.

495
00:31:52,293 --> 00:31:54,545
I like "melt."

496
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:56,798
Come on. Go shoot the crank,
let's wrap this up, all right?

497
00:31:57,799 --> 00:32:00,802
- What?
- You heard me. Spike up.

498
00:32:00,802 --> 00:32:05,440
- No fucking way.
- Christopher,
i'm producing these sessions.

499
00:32:05,807 --> 00:32:08,309
Go take the fucking drugs.
I'm not fucking around
anymore.

500
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,194
Look, the problem,
christopher,

501
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,697
is that the bass
and the drum tracks...

502
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,949
were miked wrong from
the fucking beginning.

503
00:32:14,949 --> 00:32:18,453
Whoa, hey, king of rock,
you're out of your depth.

504
00:32:18,453 --> 00:32:20,455
Look, let me tell you
something, dude.

505
00:32:20,455 --> 00:32:23,958
Thank you, but i've
recorded in denmark.

506
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:26,961
Okay. You want to know
what the problem is?

507
00:32:26,961 --> 00:32:30,465
Where are
the fucking choruses?

508
00:32:30,965 --> 00:32:33,968
All your songs,
you got no choruses.

509
00:32:33,968 --> 00:32:35,970
Your choruses are basically
just another verse.

510
00:32:36,471 --> 00:32:38,589
I mean, what happened to
"she loves you," huh?

511
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,843
- "She loves you"?
- Yeah, the song.
Started with the chorus.

512
00:32:41,843 --> 00:32:45,346
There is structure.
That's how you build
a song.

513
00:32:45,346 --> 00:32:47,348
The beatles,
the beatles,
the beatles.

514
00:32:47,348 --> 00:32:50,852
Look, that's been
40 fucking years now.
It makes me sick.

515
00:32:50,852 --> 00:32:53,738
- What is he, nuts?
- Fuck this, man.

516
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,740
Where are you goin'?

517
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:59,243
I'm goin' to a. A. ,
you fuckin' jerk- off.

518
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:02,363
- Get back to work.
- Ooh, okay.

519
00:33:02,363 --> 00:33:06,617
- Huh? Huh? Come on.
- Ooh, big man, huh?

520
00:33:11,873 --> 00:33:13,875
Fuck!
You all right?

521
00:33:17,378 --> 00:33:20,381
What? What?
Get back in the booth!

522
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,520
So we take it
from the top.

523
00:33:27,021 --> 00:33:29,023
We'll use a ukulele.

524
00:33:29,023 --> 00:33:31,642
I can't believe you.
Yeah, yeah.

525
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:33,644
Five thousand shares.

526
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:36,647
American biotics.

527
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:39,150
Can you place
the order today?

528
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:44,155
Okay, great.
I'll have the money
to you by tomorrow.

529
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:47,158
Okay.
Thank you.

530
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:50,294
Bye bye.

531
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:56,300
- Are you spying on people now?
- I live here.

532
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,669
Are you playing
wall street now.

533
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,673
Women are better
savers than men,
and we are nurturers.

534
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:06,177
What do you know
about the stock market?

535
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:08,179
I keep
my ears open.

536
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,681
Cnbc is a very
interesting channel.

537
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:15,820
Listen, your father,
god bless him,
he does very well.

538
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,322
But who knows,
you know?

539
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:20,324
What if something
unforeseen should happen.

540
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:23,327
What if he gets
hit by a truck.
I mean, then what?

541
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:25,830
I got you kids
to think about.
I don't know, mom.

542
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,833
Well, when you get
married, you will know.

543
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,835
A woman's got to keep
her sense of individuality.

544
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,837
This here is
a life lesson.

545
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:41,345
Okay. Let's go to
georgette klinger's.

546
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:46,350
Massage, facial,
joie de "beau- tay."
On me.

547
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:49,470
Sure.

548
00:34:53,975 --> 00:34:56,611
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!

549
00:34:56,611 --> 00:34:58,112
It's a lily.
Now, that's a shot.

550
00:34:58,613 --> 00:35:00,615
Ball runs like
a frightened fawn.

551
00:35:00,615 --> 00:35:03,618
W. C. Fields.
That thing's
still runnin'.

552
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:05,620
I gotta tell ya,
this is a nice place.
Didn't i tell ya?

553
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,122
We oughta see about
making you a member.

554
00:35:08,122 --> 00:35:10,625
Tony, you ever play
that place in orlando?

555
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:12,627
No, i never get
down there.

556
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:15,129
Well, disney world.

557
00:35:15,129 --> 00:35:19,133
You know, al's place.
Mount plymouth?

558
00:35:19,634 --> 00:35:22,637
- Al capone built it.
- No shit?

559
00:35:22,637 --> 00:35:25,139
Capone was a golf fanatic.
That's right.

560
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,142
- So you guys watch a&e.
-

561
00:35:28,142 --> 00:35:30,895
tony, uh, let me
ask you a question.

562
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:34,899
If i'm stepping
on any toes, tell me.
How real wasthe godfather?

563
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,522
I mean,
in your opinion.

564
00:35:41,522 --> 00:35:44,525
What do you mean, real?
Authentic or not.

565
00:35:46,027 --> 00:35:49,530
I don't know.
How would i know?

566
00:35:50,531 --> 00:35:53,534
It was the'50s, right.
No, it was 1972.

567
00:35:53,534 --> 00:35:56,537
What he means is the story
took place in the'50s.

568
00:35:56,537 --> 00:35:59,674
I wanna know if you really
had to cut your finger
and take an oath.

569
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:10,301
Like gridlock on times square
on this golf course today,
isn't it?

570
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:14,305
This traffic in manhattan's
gotten worse since
"don't block the box."

571
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:16,807
You got a lot of friends
in new york, tony?
Yeah.

572
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:19,310
You ever go down
to little italy?

573
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:23,314
- You know, san gennaro,
the feast, with the kids.
- Tell the truth.

574
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:25,449
What's the first thing
you think of when you hear
"mulberry street"?

575
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:27,451
Umberto's.

576
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:29,704
Hey, did you ever see...

577
00:36:30,204 --> 00:36:32,206
that picture
of gallante dead...

578
00:36:32,206 --> 00:36:34,575
with a cigar hangin'
out of his mouth?

579
00:36:34,575 --> 00:36:37,211
- No.
- It's a fuckin'
beautiful hit, huh?

580
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:42,466
Sorry, tony.

581
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:45,336
You probably knew
the guy, huh?

582
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:49,340
- How old you think i am?
- You don't have to answer this
if you don't want to,

583
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,342
but i gotta know.

584
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:54,345
Did you ever meet
john gotti?

585
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:01,852
Yeah.
I knew john.

586
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:04,739
Whoa! Fuck!

587
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:06,741
What was he
really like?

588
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:14,365
- Remember bungalow bar?
- The ice cream trucks?

589
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:19,503
Like good humor,
except the trucks had
bungalow roofs on'em.

590
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:22,006
Was gotti a silent partner
in all that thing?

591
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:24,375
I don't know nothin'
about that.

592
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:27,378
Just know that
when the company folded...

593
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:30,631
and they were auctioning off
the last bungalow bar truck,

594
00:37:30,631 --> 00:37:34,135
the one with the peaked roofs--
you're right, cooze--

595
00:37:34,135 --> 00:37:36,387
cooze.

596
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:40,391
Well, they're auctioning off
the last bungalow bar truck...

597
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,893
and i wanted it
as a souvenir.

598
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:46,147
Gotti outbid me.

599
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,652
Gave me a ride home.

600
00:37:55,156 --> 00:37:57,658
You know,
he rang that bell...

601
00:37:57,658 --> 00:38:00,161
the whole way home?

602
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:14,558
Oh! They're wavin'
at us.

603
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:22,183
Meow
meow

604
00:38:27,822 --> 00:38:30,324
meow
meow

605
00:38:30,324 --> 00:38:33,327
i love this part.
Now i've lost

606
00:38:33,327 --> 00:38:37,448
my inner child

607
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,085
i should hope
yeah, this is good.

608
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:45,456
He ain't been defiled

609
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:49,343
i am just

610
00:38:49,844 --> 00:38:54,098
that's some good guitar.
Listen to that shit.
A tortured soul

611
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:56,100
they got it goin' on.
Makin' money

612
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:01,972
yeah.
Is an empty hole

613
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,114
meow

614
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:12,116
meow

615
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:14,618
meow

616
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:17,121
meow

617
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,252
so?

618
00:39:31,385 --> 00:39:33,888
I think it's, uh,
not good.

619
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:37,258
Want to be a little
more specific?

620
00:39:37,258 --> 00:39:39,260
There's good and there's
not good. This is not good.

621
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,762
Okay, maybe it's not your era.
No offense.

622
00:39:42,263 --> 00:39:44,765
Music is music.
Talent is talent.

623
00:39:44,765 --> 00:39:47,768
I don't care who you are.
And i've seen them all.

624
00:39:47,768 --> 00:39:51,906
I saw heavy metal invented
by hendrix at the cafe wha.
Kid just came out of the army.

625
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:54,525
I said to him,
"kid, i don't know
what you call it--

626
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:57,027
talent, charisma, magic--
but you've got it."

627
00:39:57,027 --> 00:40:00,281
These kids, they don't.
Sorry.

628
00:40:00,281 --> 00:40:02,783
You're just pissed
that i went against you
at the sit- down.

629
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:05,920
Get the fuck out of here
and stop wasting my time.

630
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:09,039
This vito is a great
fucking guitar player, hesh.

631
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,542
Fine. Great.
He's a great guitar player.

632
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:14,545
However, there's one constant
in the music business--
a hit is a hit.

633
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:17,548
- And this, my friend,
is not a hit.
- Why?

634
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:21,936
Christ. For reasons we couldn't
comprehend or codify,
you pathetic schlepper.

635
00:40:21,936 --> 00:40:26,440
Fuckin' massive is a genius,
so what the fuck was he
talkin' about?

636
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,442
I remember when i was a kid,
there was this guy
in my neighborhood.

637
00:40:28,943 --> 00:40:30,444
We used to call him
jimmy smash.

638
00:40:30,945 --> 00:40:33,948
He wasn't retarded,

639
00:40:33,948 --> 00:40:35,449
but we thought he was because
he had one of these, uh,

640
00:40:36,951 --> 00:40:39,453
whatchamacallits.

641
00:40:39,453 --> 00:40:41,956
Hey, how the fuck
are ya?

642
00:40:41,956 --> 00:40:44,325
What do you call that?
Cleft palate.

643
00:40:44,325 --> 00:40:46,710
Yeah.

644
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:49,713
Well, we was kids, right?

645
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:52,716
So what the hell
do we know?

646
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:56,720
Every time he opened
his mouth, we'd piss
ourselves laughin'.

647
00:40:56,837 --> 00:40:59,340
But jimmy didn't mind,
because he got to hang
out with us.

648
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:02,726
Popular crew.

649
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:04,728
Although we only called him
when we were bored.

650
00:41:04,845 --> 00:41:07,348
Called him, said,
"hey, jimmy.

651
00:41:07,848 --> 00:41:09,350
Sing'mack the knife'."

652
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:11,852
And because he wanted
to hang out with us,
he'd belt it right out.

653
00:41:14,355 --> 00:41:17,241
We'd fuckin' roll
on the floor laughing.

654
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:23,247
And then, you know,
when the laughs got old,

655
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:25,249
we stopped callin' him.

656
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:31,755
Wasn't till years later that
i found out the poor prick
was goin' home every night...

657
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:34,508
and cryin' himself
to sleep.

658
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,132
When i found out,
you know, i--

659
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:44,134
i felt bad.

660
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:49,139
But i never really
understood...

661
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:50,641
what he felt.

662
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:53,143
To be used, you know,

663
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:56,647
for somebody else's amusement
like a fuckin' dancin' bear...

664
00:41:57,648 --> 00:42:00,651
till i played golf
with those guys.

665
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:05,906
Well, you thought
cusamano was your friend.

666
00:42:07,408 --> 00:42:09,410
You live, you learn.

667
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:16,550
Do you mind if i
ask you a question?

668
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:22,172
Whatever happened
to jimmy?
Jimmy smash?

669
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:25,175
He's doin' 20
for robbery.

670
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:27,678
Wasn't too hard for the cops
to figure out who it was.

671
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:29,680
He goes up to the bank teller
with a mask, he goes,

672
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,682
"give me your money."

673
00:42:41,242 --> 00:42:43,744
Some fucker's
on the phone for you.

674
00:42:48,749 --> 00:42:52,253
Good morning, herman.
I'm listening.
Good.

675
00:42:52,253 --> 00:42:55,256
I wouldn't want you to miss
anything i have to say.
I've been thinking about it.

676
00:42:55,756 --> 00:42:59,627
- Go on.
- You'll have to find another
schmuck to have a moment with.

677
00:42:59,627 --> 00:43:01,128
You do know
what this means, herman.

678
00:43:01,128 --> 00:43:04,131
Stupid enough to say it
over the phone, let's hear it.

679
00:43:04,632 --> 00:43:06,634
I don't threaten, herman.
I act.

680
00:43:06,634 --> 00:43:09,887
Genius,
you're getting yourself in
way over your head here.

681
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:12,389
Why don't you think about
backin' up a little bit?

682
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:14,775
You know,
let sleepin' dogs lie.

683
00:43:14,775 --> 00:43:16,277
Hey, soprano.

684
00:43:16,777 --> 00:43:19,530
Let me share with you
what i suspect about
this gangsta rap shit.

685
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:22,533
I think you probably got
a degree in sociology
from the city college.

686
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,903
I grew up in the projects.
Delta 13.

687
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:28,906
Killed a man.

688
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:30,908
Later on,
i got a degree.

689
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:34,411
But urban planning.
You were close.

690
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:36,914
Now, when it comes to
which is mightier,

691
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:39,917
the pen or the
motherfucking sword,

692
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:41,919
i let the situation
dictate.

693
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:45,422
- Don't press it.
- I'm gonna do my part...

694
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:47,925
to keep mr. Rabkin's
people working.

695
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:52,563
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Expect to hear from
goldstein, baum and woronov.

696
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:55,432
They'll be representing
miss willis in the lawsuit.

697
00:43:55,432 --> 00:43:59,687
- You gonna sue?
- With what i pay in retainers,
fuck, yeah.

698
00:43:59,687 --> 00:44:02,189
I hear that.
Yeah, well.

699
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:03,941
Listen, be advised...

700
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:06,443
that on your artist
scratch's last single,

701
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:08,445
you sampled
a backing vocal...

702
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:11,949
from the chablis'
1968 song,"riff with it,"

703
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:15,452
for which f- note records
controls the master
recording rights.

704
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:17,955
No shit?
Yeah, shit.

705
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:20,591
I would of course
have to counter sue.

706
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:23,093
I'll see you in court.

707
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:26,597
Fuckin' legal fees.

708
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:29,216
What kind of moolies
are these?

709
00:44:29,717 --> 00:44:31,719
They call themselves
gangsters.

710
00:44:31,719 --> 00:44:34,104
It's a new fuckin' day.

711
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:36,607
Fuckin' depressing.

712
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:39,476
Okay. Now this
is a donatella versace.

713
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:43,480
- Nice.
- You like it better
than the alaia?

714
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:52,990
- Keep'em both.
- Christopher, $2, 400!

715
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:58,495
- I don't think
you really like it.
- I like it. I like it.

716
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:09,506
Huh?
Mtv awards?

717
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:18,148
- What?
- Nothing.

718
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:20,651
I thought we put
that fight behind us.

719
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:23,153
You want me to take
all this back, i will.
No problem.

720
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:26,156
No. Fuck, i want you
to have it.

721
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:45,175
You know how i use
the technique of
positive visualization?

722
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:47,177
I know you talk about it.

723
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:49,179
You're fairly negative
a lot of the time.

724
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:51,932
Well, i think you should
mentally prepare...

725
00:45:52,433 --> 00:45:55,936
for the fuckin' possibility
that visiting day sucks.

726
00:45:58,939 --> 00:46:01,942
- What?
- I think the only reason you've
gotten this far with massive...

727
00:46:01,942 --> 00:46:04,695
is he wants to be
in your pants.

728
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:08,699
Boy, oh, boy.

729
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:10,701
I let some experts
listen to the demo.

730
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:12,703
They shit all over it.
I'm sorry.

731
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:15,205
Experts?
Who, hesh?

732
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:18,208
That old fucking
synagogue cantor?
Silvio.

733
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,210
He owned rock clubs
in asbury.

734
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:23,213
You heard what squid said.
He's a professional engineer.

735
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:25,215
What about my opinion?

736
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:27,718
That it's good,
that it's special?

737
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:38,846
His eyes are on your ass,
adriana, 98% of the time.
You know that.

738
00:46:40,347 --> 00:46:42,349
This is just a way
for you to keep me down.

739
00:46:42,349 --> 00:46:45,352
- Aw, that ain't fair.
- I don't want these clothes.

740
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:54,862
What's wrong with it, huh?
What's wrong
with visiting day?

741
00:46:54,862 --> 00:46:58,365
I don't know,
but it's a problem
that you don't know.

742
00:46:58,365 --> 00:47:00,367
Richie, he'll sing
anything.

743
00:47:00,367 --> 00:47:03,370
You just don't want to believe
that i could have a relationship
with a man...

744
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:06,373
like massive that wasn't
based on fucking.

745
00:47:06,373 --> 00:47:08,375
That was based
on intelligence,

746
00:47:08,375 --> 00:47:10,377
respect, talent.

747
00:47:10,377 --> 00:47:12,379
I'll shut up.

748
00:47:16,383 --> 00:47:18,886
You sayin'
i don't have talent?

749
00:47:22,389 --> 00:47:24,892
I've branched out,
made new friends,
new horizons,

750
00:47:24,892 --> 00:47:26,894
and you can't stand that.

751
00:47:29,396 --> 00:47:31,398
Yeah.

752
00:47:31,398 --> 00:47:33,400
Go silent. That's you.

753
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,903
Either screaming your head off
or fucking dead.

754
00:47:37,905 --> 00:47:40,407
I don't think i can
stay here anymore.

755
00:47:47,548 --> 00:47:50,551
I love you.
That is such a lie.

756
00:47:58,926 --> 00:48:01,061
Hey, carmela!

757
00:48:01,061 --> 00:48:03,564
In here.

758
00:48:09,069 --> 00:48:11,071
I need a finger.

759
00:48:12,573 --> 00:48:15,075
What's in the box?
Sand.

760
00:48:15,075 --> 00:48:18,579
I'm fuckin' with
cusamano.
Tony--

761
00:48:18,579 --> 00:48:20,080
beautiful.

762
00:48:20,581 --> 00:48:22,583
You look kinda cute
when you're bein'
a bad boy.

763
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:24,585
You're awfully chipper
today.

764
00:48:25,085 --> 00:48:26,587
So what are you
gonna do with the box?

765
00:48:26,587 --> 00:48:31,091
Give it to him. Tell him to--
"hold on to it for awhile."

766
00:48:31,091 --> 00:48:34,094
Oh, tony!
That is so evil!

767
00:48:34,094 --> 00:48:36,096
Yeah, i know.
That's why it's
so much fun.

768
00:48:37,097 --> 00:48:39,099
Oh, good.

769
00:48:57,734 --> 00:49:00,237
Cooze. Cooze.

770
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:02,739
Cooze.

00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:13,750
you know,
that, uh, nickname--

775
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:15,752
what, cooze?
Cusamano.

776
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:19,756
Yeah, it's got that
other connotation that--
no, not anymore.

777
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:22,259
Listen, pal,
i need a little solid.

778
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:25,262
I need you to hang on
to this for a while for me.

779
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:28,765
Hang onto it a little while.
I'll come get it when i need it.

780
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:33,770
How long?
A month, you know.
Maybe more, maybe less.

781
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:36,273
Okay?
Thanks.
Yeah, sure.

782
00:49:37,774 --> 00:49:41,278
Oh, the club. I meant
to ask you about the club.
What's going on?

783
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:43,780
Oh, the club.

784
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:45,782
I'm sorry, ton'.

785
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:48,285
Membership's closed.

786
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:51,288
Closed?
Yeah.

787
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:54,291
No new members
until old members die.

788
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,793
Nobody's dyin'?

789
00:49:57,294 --> 00:49:59,296
Nothin' anybody
could do anything about.

790
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:01,798
No biggie, cooze.
Thanks.
You sure?

791
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:04,301
I mean, because--
naw.

792
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:06,803
I'll live.

793
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:47,978
And all temptations
i resist

794
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:50,981
and nothing can compare
to this

795
00:50:51,231 --> 00:50:55,736
oh, nobody loves me

796
00:50:55,736 --> 00:50:59,239
nobody loves me but you

797
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:02,492
and for that
i'd love to find

798
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:07,497
i'd give it all away
in gratitude

799
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,502
now, uh,
that's a hit.

800
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:19,259
And all temptations
i resist

801
00:51:19,259 --> 00:51:21,261
nothing can compare

802
00:51:25,132 --> 00:51:27,134
what is it?
Heroin?

803
00:51:27,134 --> 00:51:29,136
Shit, jean,
i don't know.

804
00:51:29,136 --> 00:51:31,138
A weapon?
I don't know.

805
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:35,142
Could be anything.

806
00:51:35,142 --> 00:51:37,144
Uh, uh!

807
00:51:37,644 --> 00:51:39,146
Don't touch it.
