1
00:01:34,014 --> 00:01:37,513
how much blood will
you shed to stay alive, michael?

2
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,580
live or die,
make your choice.

3
00:01:40,647 --> 00:01:44,014
who the fuck are you?

4
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,613
<i>- what the fuck
you doing in there?</i>

5
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,780
we're gonna
miss the previews.

6
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,247
what?

7
00:02:02,314 --> 00:02:05,281
tell me your earring went
in the fucking drain again.

8
00:02:07,281 --> 00:02:09,247
i'm pregnant.

9
00:02:11,247 --> 00:02:14,047
<i>i know it's my fault. i know i shouldn't
have let you take off the rubber.</i>

10
00:02:14,114 --> 00:02:16,981
i thought we were okay. i was due for
my period. my cycle's like clockwork.

11
00:02:17,047 --> 00:02:19,147
stop.

12
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:24,247
- i'll call the clinic tomorrow.
- stop talking.

13
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:41,814
let's get married.

14
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,814
what?

15
00:02:46,114 --> 00:02:48,647
we'll drive to a.c.,
make a day out of it.

16
00:02:48,714 --> 00:02:51,480
are you serious?

17
00:02:55,981 --> 00:02:58,147
christopher.
i love you.

18
00:03:05,847 --> 00:03:08,981
- my baby.
- yeah.

19
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:11,747
my ex, she couldn't have
kids, and i wanted 'em so bad.

20
00:03:11,814 --> 00:03:15,014
- the one who
ran out on you?

21
00:03:18,314 --> 00:03:20,680
you can bet she's having some
other asshole's kid, though.

22
00:03:20,747 --> 00:03:23,547
that fucking tramp.

23
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,880
elzear, patron saint
of zeppoles.

24
00:03:42,947 --> 00:03:45,847
could use a shot
of lacquer.

25
00:03:45,914 --> 00:03:49,214
- fix that halo, too.
- shh!

26
00:03:49,281 --> 00:03:51,281
hello.

27
00:03:51,348 --> 00:03:53,513
mr. gaultieri,
i'm father jose.

28
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,381
i'm mr. gaultieri.
where's father felix?

29
00:03:56,448 --> 00:03:58,247
unfortunately he's ill.

30
00:03:58,314 --> 00:04:00,780
he's having bypass surgery.
he asked me to fill in.

31
00:04:00,847 --> 00:04:03,513
you know mr. russamano from
the neighborhood association.

32
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,613
sure, paulie, chuck,
how you feeling?

33
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,747
he was an altar boy.

34
00:04:08,814 --> 00:04:11,448
ahh.

35
00:04:11,513 --> 00:04:14,780
so the feast
of st. elzear.

36
00:04:14,847 --> 00:04:16,780
father felix brought me
up to speed.

37
00:04:16,847 --> 00:04:18,947
i'd like to hear your
ideas for this year.

38
00:04:19,014 --> 00:04:20,880
well, there ain't much
to talk about.

39
00:04:20,947 --> 00:04:23,448
it's all done through
our nonprofit corporation.

40
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,981
we close the streets
for five days,

41
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:28,414
hire the food vendors,
rides, et cetera.

42
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,414
day two, we start
the procession,

43
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,547
push the statue up
and down the block.

44
00:04:32,613 --> 00:04:34,381
you say a couple
of prayers and that's that.

45
00:04:34,448 --> 00:04:36,714
all's said and done,
you get your end.

46
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,448
about that, as i was
telling mr. russamano,

47
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:44,747
frankly $10,000
struck me as quite low.

48
00:04:44,814 --> 00:04:46,780
it is what it is.

49
00:04:46,847 --> 00:04:49,780
look, i'm new here. i certainly
don't wanna rock the boat.

50
00:04:49,847 --> 00:04:52,547
i realize there are certain
neighborhood traditions.

51
00:04:52,613 --> 00:04:55,014
it's just that given the current
costs, we feel an increase

52
00:04:55,081 --> 00:04:57,880
- is long overdue.
- what kind of increase?

53
00:04:57,947 --> 00:05:00,914
we feel $50,000 would be
a more equitable donation.

54
00:05:00,981 --> 00:05:03,880
<i>- 50?
- just this year, we started a soup kitchen</i>

55
00:05:03,947 --> 00:05:06,513
for the homeless, a reading
program for bilingual children.

56
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,714
there's less help than ever
from the federal government.

57
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,714
you think this feast
pays for itself?

58
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,314
security, electric,
sanitation.

59
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:15,147
<i>- not to mention fuel costs.
- yeah.</i>

60
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:18,247
the way it seems to break
down is you spend $18

61
00:05:18,314 --> 00:05:20,513
for a city permit
to close down the street,

62
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,647
charge fees
to the vendors

63
00:05:22,714 --> 00:05:24,981
in the thousands of
dollars to lease out land

64
00:05:25,047 --> 00:05:26,680
that you don't
even own.

65
00:05:26,747 --> 00:05:30,014
yeah? well, it seems to me the
church has plenty in its coffers

66
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:33,348
for all those
pedophilia lawsuits.

67
00:05:33,414 --> 00:05:36,613
the parish's deal was negotiated
since this was johnny soprano's feast.

68
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,480
these are different times,
mr. gaultieri.

69
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,214
well, some things
don't change.

70
00:05:41,281 --> 00:05:44,314
couple of days, joe vella from the
honor guard will be by with the float.

71
00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:47,147
transfer the statue
from his nitch,

72
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:49,314
pick up the hat
and other stuff.

73
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:51,547
you say things
don't change.

74
00:05:51,613 --> 00:05:53,547
this feast was started
over 100 years ago

75
00:05:53,613 --> 00:05:55,480
in a spirit of giving.

76
00:05:55,547 --> 00:05:57,580
italian immigrants,
the working poor

77
00:05:57,647 --> 00:06:00,680
gave what little money they
had to honor st. elzear.

78
00:06:00,747 --> 00:06:03,381
he's the patron saint
from my grandparent's town--

79
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:06,547
- ariano di puglia.
- many of those folks gave their gold wedding bands,

80
00:06:06,613 --> 00:06:09,480
- which were melted down to make the saint's hat.
- yeah?

81
00:06:09,547 --> 00:06:13,714
the holy society
of st. elzear,

82
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,314
of which you are
recording secretary,

83
00:06:17,381 --> 00:06:20,047
has for the past
100 years entrusted us

84
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:22,714
with the care
of that habiliment.

85
00:06:25,181 --> 00:06:27,181
frankly...

86
00:06:27,247 --> 00:06:29,547
i don't feel safe
giving it over this year.

87
00:06:29,613 --> 00:06:32,081
we use it every year.
it's part of the tradition.

88
00:06:32,147 --> 00:06:34,047
<i>i understand,
but i'm sorry.</i>

89
00:06:34,114 --> 00:06:37,081
given the tenor of this conversation,
i sense there's a possible

90
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,680
criminal element
in this neighborhood

91
00:06:38,747 --> 00:06:42,414
that could endanger this
precious piece of local history.

92
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,547
but for 50 grand, you
wouldn't have that sense.

93
00:06:46,613 --> 00:06:49,680
it would demonstrate to me that
you take this feast as seriously

94
00:06:49,747 --> 00:06:51,247
as the people
who began it.

95
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:56,147
okay, father,
nice meeting you.

96
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,580
fuck the hat!

97
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:16,914
it's fucking bullshit.

98
00:07:16,981 --> 00:07:19,114
i got a fax from eddie lind,
allegheny carting.

99
00:07:19,181 --> 00:07:22,747
they wanna raise the tipping
fee again on solid waste.

100
00:07:22,814 --> 00:07:25,613
just the man
i wanted to see.

101
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,281
i gotta go down to pennsylvania
and i'm gonna need backup.

102
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,914
i'm busy managing
thfeast.

103
00:07:31,981 --> 00:07:35,014
vice president
in charge of calzones.

104
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:37,214
where the fuck
you been anyway?

105
00:07:39,147 --> 00:07:41,780
is that what
i think it is?

106
00:07:41,847 --> 00:07:45,047
you are now looking
at a newly married man.

107
00:07:45,114 --> 00:07:47,814
- ho-ho-holy shit!
- kelli?

108
00:07:50,247 --> 00:07:52,547
what the fuck
brought this on?

109
00:07:52,613 --> 00:07:55,247
visit from the stork
coming up.

110
00:07:57,114 --> 00:07:59,047
you never heard
of pulling out?

111
00:07:59,114 --> 00:08:01,480
sweetheart, little
cristal over here.

112
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,914
- you know what you're having?
- boy, i hope.

113
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:07,114
i tell ya, t,
with the example you set,

114
00:08:07,181 --> 00:08:09,714
plus the wisdom
i learned from a.a.,

115
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,947
it's an inspiration--
building blocks,

116
00:08:12,014 --> 00:08:14,281
home, family.

117
00:08:14,348 --> 00:08:17,480
yeah, that's what
it's all about, kid.

118
00:08:17,547 --> 00:08:19,480
just water for me.

119
00:08:19,547 --> 00:08:21,914
<i>- my son will
be my strength.</i>

120
00:08:25,448 --> 00:08:27,281
yeah.

121
00:08:27,348 --> 00:08:29,114
i did?

122
00:08:29,181 --> 00:08:31,147
what are you,
new in the office?

123
00:08:31,214 --> 00:08:33,513
talk to dr. cipolla.

124
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,747
i don't pay
for missed appointments.

125
00:08:35,814 --> 00:08:39,547
- to the baby.
- to the baby.

126
00:08:39,613 --> 00:08:41,613
<i>- salut.
- salut.</i>

127
00:08:44,047 --> 00:08:45,714
make a note to call
freddie at disorbo's.

128
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,747
he wants to sponsor
the cannoli-eating contest,

129
00:08:47,814 --> 00:08:50,281
i better see an envelope
by tomorrow.

130
00:08:52,613 --> 00:08:56,513
anyway, my guy at the
weigh station's on board.

131
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,880
- you know how to get back, right?
- i mapblasted it.

132
00:08:58,947 --> 00:09:01,014

133
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,414
look, pittsburgh.

134
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,847
what the fuck? we're
supposed to be headed east.

135
00:09:14,981 --> 00:09:18,714
are we .7 miles
past route 62 yet?

136
00:09:20,613 --> 00:09:22,847
i gotta take a piss.

137
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,247
you seeing this?

138
00:09:55,314 --> 00:09:57,448
<i>looks like bikers.</i>

139
00:10:01,414 --> 00:10:03,747
<i>wooden crates.</i>

140
00:10:03,814 --> 00:10:06,780
it's good wine.

141
00:10:36,547 --> 00:10:39,647
- what the fuck?
- who the fuck are you guys?

142
00:10:39,714 --> 00:10:42,414
- that's who i am, you mangy cocksucker.
- take it easy.

143
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,081
on the ground or i'll blow
your greasy fucking heads off.

144
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:48,448
<i>- you guys cops?
- how's your incision, lieutenant?</i>

145
00:10:48,513 --> 00:10:51,680
- 10-4. - you're fucking
with the vipers here, asshole.

146
00:10:51,747 --> 00:10:53,814
ooh, really?

147
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,448
what's that,
your girl scout troop?

148
00:10:56,513 --> 00:10:58,414
shut up,
fucking douche bag.

149
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,613
let's go.

150
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:06,314
- get him!
- ow!

151
00:11:14,747 --> 00:11:17,480
i hit him!
i fucking hit him!

152
00:11:17,547 --> 00:11:20,114
fuck you!

153
00:11:22,513 --> 00:11:24,513
yee-ha!

154
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:33,680
that was fucking awesome.
fucking old school shit.

155
00:11:33,747 --> 00:11:35,480
opportunity knocked.

156
00:11:35,547 --> 00:11:38,314
knocked? kicked
the fucking door in.

157
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,714
oh, fuck!

158
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,547
you okay, t?

159
00:11:44,613 --> 00:11:47,114
fucking ankle,
i guess i sprained it.

160
00:11:52,348 --> 00:11:55,647
you smell that?
it's fucking autumn.

161
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:58,580
it's like the first fall night when
you're a kid, and the air's all crisp,

162
00:11:58,647 --> 00:12:00,947
and you start smelling
people's fireplaces.

163
00:12:01,014 --> 00:12:03,014
smells like halloween.

164
00:12:05,047 --> 00:12:07,014
ha ha!

165
00:12:14,547 --> 00:12:16,780
oh...

166
00:12:16,847 --> 00:12:19,880
chateau pichon-longueville,
1986.

167
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,348
'86-- ooh, baby.

168
00:12:22,414 --> 00:12:24,513
show me the money.

169
00:12:25,814 --> 00:12:28,348
what's your corkage fee?

170
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,414
how about that prick's
face when he saw the gat?

171
00:12:35,613 --> 00:12:38,547
the grizzly adams
motherfucker?

172
00:12:38,613 --> 00:12:41,947
"whoa, take it easy."

173
00:12:42,014 --> 00:12:44,847
"we're with the vipers."

174
00:12:56,914 --> 00:12:59,513
how's that wine, good?

175
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,547

i gotta say.

176
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,747
i tell ya, though,

177
00:13:08,814 --> 00:13:10,947
when he pulled
that trigger,

178
00:13:11,014 --> 00:13:12,914
i almost shit myself.

179
00:13:14,647 --> 00:13:16,613

180
00:13:24,448 --> 00:13:26,613
i miss it sometimes.
i'll be honest.

181
00:13:28,314 --> 00:13:29,747
the wine.

182
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,914
you should toast
to your wedding, at least.

183
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,448
your kid.

184
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:41,081
discipline, that's all.

185
00:13:41,147 --> 00:13:43,947
set limits for myself.

186
00:13:51,147 --> 00:13:54,414
on the other side,
they consider wine food.

187
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,513
oh, yeah?

188
00:13:58,181 --> 00:14:01,114
<i>- salut.
- salut.</i>

189
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,513
i'm gonna have to
sleep on my back.

190
00:14:12,847 --> 00:14:15,381
- what are you doing?
- nightcap.

191
00:14:15,448 --> 00:14:18,981
there's a swiss army
in the console.

192
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:27,147
when you think of the shit
we've been through, huh?

193
00:14:27,214 --> 00:14:29,281
shit we've done.

194
00:14:33,348 --> 00:14:35,847
fucking three musketeers.

195
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:45,414
we got a bond.

196
00:14:47,414 --> 00:14:49,513
it's very special.

197
00:14:55,448 --> 00:14:58,647
you saved my life
in a lot of ways.

198
00:14:58,714 --> 00:15:01,680
you've been there for me,
too, you know?

199
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,814
don't think
i don't know that.

200
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,014
there were times

201
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:10,047
it was hard
with me and you.

202
00:15:10,114 --> 00:15:11,680
i didn't understand.

203
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:18,381
you were young.

204
00:15:18,448 --> 00:15:20,448
stubborn.

205
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,047
you always had
my back, though.

206
00:15:27,448 --> 00:15:30,081
like that day
when i came to the house.

207
00:15:36,381 --> 00:15:38,414
i gotta talk to you.

208
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:56,880

been loyal to you, t.

211
00:16:03,847 --> 00:16:07,448
what are you trying
to tell me, christopher?

212
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,880
i can't even say it.

213
00:16:17,181 --> 00:16:19,680

00:16:19,747 --> 00:16:21,448

223
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:57,181
- what did she give 'em?

224
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,714

226
00:17:04,547 --> 00:17:06,780

shouldn't we see the
inside first, sweetie?

261
00:20:05,047 --> 00:20:07,947
if it has an inside,
we're buying it.

262
00:20:28,547 --> 00:20:31,847
where's the rest? five days
rent in advance, i said.

263
00:20:31,914 --> 00:20:35,647

gives you a rebate for bad weather.

264
00:20:35,714 --> 00:20:38,181
yet anher reason
i don't live in ohio.

265
00:20:41,247 --> 00:20:44,181

268
00:20:52,513 --> 00:20:55,880
it's an old polo injury.

269
00:20:55,947 --> 00:20:58,448
huh?

270
00:20:59,647 --> 00:21:01,914
let me talk
to you a minute.

271
00:21:05,914 --> 00:21:07,847
couple of guys we know,

272
00:21:07,914 --> 00:21:10,314
lebanese or some shit,

273
00:21:10,381 --> 00:21:14,247
they diverted a truck, whole semi
trailer full of centrum multivitamins.

274
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,247
that's a fucking score.

275
00:21:16,314 --> 00:21:18,247
yeah, the thing is it's gotta
be unloaded out of state,

276
00:21:18,314 --> 00:21:21,947
'cause the troopers are
on it. you interested?

277
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:25,613
could be distributed
in long island.

278
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,181
what's my end?

279
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:31,414
50-50, but it's gotta
be done now, tonight.

280
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,448
tonight?

281
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,114
all right,
but in this case,

282
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:43,414
i'm thinking we spare john the
stress of having to hear about this.

283
00:21:50,081 --> 00:21:53,613
the situation he's in, he's
got enough to deal with.

284
00:21:58,847 --> 00:22:01,181
get me frankie cosme
on the cell.

285
00:22:16,281 --> 00:22:19,081
yeah, somebody wants
to talk to you. hold on.

286
00:22:32,414 --> 00:22:34,480
did you pray?

287
00:22:34,547 --> 00:22:36,680
said a "thank you"
for daddy's recovery.

288
00:22:38,247 --> 00:22:41,981
you had arthroscopic surgery,
you can't bend a knee?

289
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,047
dad said he's gonna
meet us on the corner.

290
00:22:48,114 --> 00:22:50,480

291
00:22:50,547 --> 00:22:54,147
- oh my god. she looks terrible.
- who?

292
00:22:54,214 --> 00:22:57,181
chris' ex, her mom.

293
00:22:57,247 --> 00:22:59,547
she saw us.
i should say hello.

294
00:23:03,214 --> 00:23:05,448

00:23:08,047 --> 00:23:10,014
carmela soprano.

297
00:23:10,081 --> 00:23:12,880
<i>- how's your daughter?

301
00:23:20,147 --> 00:23:23,081
they broke up, liz.
she ran off.

302
00:23:23,147 --> 00:23:25,414
she doesn't call me
for almost two years.

303
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,414
my birthday,
christmas.

304
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,448
you two always did have
a very difficult relationship.

305
00:23:30,513 --> 00:23:32,547
the fbi came
to my home.

306
00:23:32,613 --> 00:23:35,547
you'd be azed at the
questions they asked me.

307
00:23:35,613 --> 00:23:39,381
- liz-- - they admitted they
think that he killed her.

308
00:23:39,448 --> 00:23:41,381
come on, liz,
you're drunk.

309
00:23:41,448 --> 00:23:44,680
drunk-- it's called
depression.

310
00:23:44,747 --> 00:23:47,381
i haven't had a drink
in years.

311
00:23:52,448 --> 00:23:55,081
<i>there were times,
i was a kid,</i>

312
00:23:55,147 --> 00:23:58,081
my friend ronnie, we'd play
on the floor of my kitchen--

313
00:23:58,147 --> 00:24:01,880
linoleum, matchbox cars
or whatever.

314
00:24:01,947 --> 00:24:04,814
he'd go home, his fucking
knees would be filthy.

315
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,714
his elbows-- she never
cleaned, my mother.

316
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,281
fucking house
was a pigsty.

317
00:24:11,348 --> 00:24:15,247
ronnie's mother made him stop
coming over it was so dirty.

318
00:24:15,314 --> 00:24:18,081
- that's fucked up.
- embarrassing.

319
00:24:18,147 --> 00:24:20,647
my kid,
it'll be different.

320
00:24:20,714 --> 00:24:23,147
he'll be proud
of his house.

321
00:24:23,214 --> 00:24:25,547

this place.

322
00:24:27,914 --> 00:24:29,714

good job.

325
00:24:35,847 --> 00:24:37,814
it's a little less cash
than we talked about.

326
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,247
but there's a bonus
in there for you.

327
00:24:46,647 --> 00:24:49,747

00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:09,613

okay, it's just,
you know, if you want.

345
00:26:13,381 --> 00:26:15,547

00:26:15,613 --> 00:26:18,348

00:26:18,414 --> 00:26:20,348
i used
to get diarrhea

348
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:22,780
just from the smell
of paper money--

349
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:27,348
in a store,
any fucking place,

350
00:26:27,414 --> 00:26:29,780
on account of all the
baby laxative in the coke

351
00:26:29,847 --> 00:26:32,414
when you actually
snort it.

352
00:26:34,448 --> 00:26:36,580
i meant what i said,
though,

353
00:26:36,647 --> 00:26:39,947
you need to get
your ass to rehab.

354
00:26:40,014 --> 00:26:43,214
fucking narcotics
anonymous or some shit.

355
00:26:58,281 --> 00:27:00,214
how do you like
this car?

356
00:27:00,281 --> 00:27:04,647
it's nice,
the leather.

357
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,247
see ya.

358
00:29:57,547 --> 00:29:59,680
<i>here he comes.</i>

359
00:29:59,747 --> 00:30:02,081
god bless you,
st. elzear.

360
00:30:02,147 --> 00:30:04,714
where's his gold hat?

361
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:18,247
<i>pray for my mother, st. elzear.</i>

362
00:30:18,314 --> 00:30:20,914
hey, they forgot
his hat.

363
00:30:23,181 --> 00:30:26,981
this is my nephew george.
just back from iraq.

364
00:30:27,047 --> 00:30:31,247
<i>- two tours he done.
- i'm proud of you, my friend.</i>

365
00:30:39,014 --> 00:30:40,947
what do you need?

366
00:30:41,014 --> 00:30:42,981
i don't know.

367
00:30:44,448 --> 00:30:48,314
there's prosciutto in there,
some leftover sesame noodles.

368
00:30:50,714 --> 00:30:53,114
tofu would make
your doctor happy.

369
00:31:07,814 --> 00:31:09,780
how's the ankle?

370
00:31:09,847 --> 00:31:11,547
it's better.

371
00:31:11,613 --> 00:31:13,580
cold packs helped.

372
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:18,214
did you have
the riser fixed?

373
00:31:18,281 --> 00:31:22,314
yeah, yeah, brian spatafore
was over the pork store.

374
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:25,613
had him tighten up
the banister, everything.

375
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,647
you all right?

376
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,513
i have been debating
all night whether

377
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,747
to even say anything
about this.

378
00:31:39,448 --> 00:31:43,047
i ran into liz la cerva
at the feast.

379
00:31:45,547 --> 00:31:47,981
- yeah...
- she's got it in her head

380
00:31:48,047 --> 00:31:50,448
that christopher
killed adriana.

381
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,613
what? that's insane.

382
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,513
i know.

383
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,780
then again, he does have a history
of being free with his hands.

384
00:32:02,847 --> 00:32:05,247
that makes him o.j.?

385
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:07,513
she was probably drunk.

386
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,914
i really don't
think she was.

387
00:32:11,747 --> 00:32:15,348
let me school you on
domestic violence, okay?

388
00:32:15,414 --> 00:32:18,580
first and foremost,
there's always a body.

389
00:32:18,647 --> 00:32:21,348
and 99 out of 100--

390
00:32:21,414 --> 00:32:23,680
and this comes straight
from my cop buddies--

391
00:32:23,747 --> 00:32:27,647
<i>it happens either in the
bedroom or in the kitchen.</i>

392
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,147
he killed her,

393
00:32:31,214 --> 00:32:33,580
believe me with the
forensics they got nowadays,

394
00:32:33,647 --> 00:32:37,647
the fibers,
we'd know about it.

395
00:32:37,714 --> 00:32:41,114
the fbi came
to her house-- liz.

396
00:32:41,181 --> 00:32:44,047
that's exactly my point. if
they really thought he did it,

397
00:32:44,114 --> 00:32:46,947
how fast do you think
they'd haul his ass in?

398
00:32:50,448 --> 00:32:52,547
sour grapes, carm.

399
00:32:52,613 --> 00:32:55,680
he dumps her daughter, all of a
sudden he's scott fucking peterson.

400
00:32:55,747 --> 00:33:00,114
<i>- i thought ade dumped him.
- you know what i mean.</i>

401
00:33:00,181 --> 00:33:03,814
she was a sweet girl, ade, but the two
of them together was a toxic relationship.

402
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,981
yeah, they did have
a rough time of it.

403
00:33:07,047 --> 00:33:09,014
and he's doing great--
christopher.

404
00:33:09,081 --> 00:33:10,981
he's a different person.

405
00:33:11,047 --> 00:33:12,981
he's married.
he's got a kid on the way.

406
00:33:13,047 --> 00:33:15,214
<i>he's focused.</i>

407
00:33:15,281 --> 00:33:18,680
let's not sabotage
his progress.

408
00:33:21,114 --> 00:33:23,081
hmm?

409
00:33:33,114 --> 00:33:36,014
have a dozen extra large
brought over to satriale's.

410
00:33:38,114 --> 00:33:40,714
<i>- hello.
- paul, dr. cipolla.</i>

411
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:44,047
<i>i'm on my way out. i received
the results of your psa test.</i>

412
00:33:44,114 --> 00:33:46,348
<i>- and?
- not to worry.</i>

413
00:33:46,414 --> 00:33:48,414
<i>but the numbers are a
little higher than i prefer.</i>

414
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,448
<i>- what does that mean?
- probably nothing.</i>

415
00:33:51,513 --> 00:33:54,981
<i>likelihood is prostatitis,
simple inflammation.</i>

416
00:33:55,047 --> 00:33:58,348
<i>you have a history of
prostate cancer in your family?</i>

417
00:33:58,414 --> 00:34:01,448
<i>- father maybe?
- i don't know.</i>

418
00:34:01,513 --> 00:34:04,281
<i>well, i'd like to go ahead
and schedule you for a biopsy.</i>

419
00:34:07,647 --> 00:34:10,114
<i>this is lame.
i wanna go on the octopus.</i>

420
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:12,381
can you stop for one minute
breaking my balls?

421
00:34:12,448 --> 00:34:14,680
when your father gets back
from the bathroom with sophia,

422
00:34:14,747 --> 00:34:16,981
- you can go on whatever.
- it's a kiddie ride.

423
00:34:17,047 --> 00:34:19,647
yeah, but she wants to go on
the ride with her big brother.

424
00:34:19,714 --> 00:34:23,114
here we go!
you ready, baby?

425
00:34:23,181 --> 00:34:24,714
go for a ride
with mama?

426
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,647
this is too small.
i'll be all squished.

427
00:34:26,714 --> 00:34:29,014
yeah, so you go sit in
that one, and wave to her.

428
00:34:29,081 --> 00:34:31,181
oh, there's my girl.

429
00:34:31,247 --> 00:34:34,381
there's my girl!

430
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:37,714
yeah, are you ready to go
on the ride with mama?

431
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,747
<i>are you ready?
get ready.</i>

432
00:34:41,814 --> 00:34:44,214
<i>yeah,
we're gonna go soon.</i>

433
00:34:44,281 --> 00:34:48,014
<i>oh, here we go!</i>

434
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:51,081
all around the floor.

435
00:34:51,147 --> 00:34:54,214
wipe that puss
off your face.

436
00:34:55,747 --> 00:34:59,014
wee-hee!

437
00:35:17,847 --> 00:35:20,947
- my baby!
- oh my god, call an ambulance!

438
00:35:21,014 --> 00:35:23,214
excuse me!

439
00:35:23,281 --> 00:35:26,081
<i>- it's okay.
it's okay.</i>

440
00:35:26,147 --> 00:35:27,714
this is
a temperature gun.

441
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,448
217°.

442
00:35:30,513 --> 00:35:32,714
look at that.

443
00:35:35,847 --> 00:35:38,281
<i>- yeah.
- paulie, it's me.</i>

444
00:35:38,348 --> 00:35:40,947
we had a problem down here.
the ride--

445
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,647
the teacups
or whatever,

446
00:35:42,714 --> 00:35:44,981
a bolt busted.
thing jammed up.

447
00:35:45,047 --> 00:35:47,580
<i>- some people got hurt.
- where's the guy who owns it?</i>

448
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:49,914
he's talking
to the cops.

449
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,314
fine, fuck it. what do you want from me?

450
00:35:52,381 --> 00:35:55,580
it's pretty bad, paulie.
lady broke her wrist.

451
00:35:55,647 --> 00:35:58,247
some puerto rican kid
lost some teeth.

452
00:35:58,314 --> 00:36:00,281
what am i,
a fucking dentist?

453
00:36:00,348 --> 00:36:02,547
<i>i don't know. i thought
you'd want to know.</i>

454
00:36:02,613 --> 00:36:04,780
<i>maybe come down
or something.</i>

455
00:36:04,847 --> 00:36:08,680
i gotta be up in the morning.
i got my fucking biopsy.

456
00:36:08,747 --> 00:36:11,181
all right,
i'll take care of it.

457
00:36:15,014 --> 00:36:17,414
now's your last chance
to take advantage...

458
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,414
one second
you're sitting there

459
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,414
enjoying a ride
with your family,

460
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,780
the next your entire
world comes crashing down.

461
00:36:25,214 --> 00:36:27,014
i close my eyes. i can
still hear the screams.

462
00:36:27,081 --> 00:36:29,981
we should all be
thankful it's okay.

463
00:36:30,047 --> 00:36:31,981
my baby could have
been killed, tony.

464
00:36:32,047 --> 00:36:34,014
god forbid.

465
00:36:35,547 --> 00:36:38,513
you can bet the locals will be
parading in with their lawsuits.

466
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,680
<i>el mucho pesos.</i>

467
00:36:45,214 --> 00:36:47,547
just leave it alone,
janice.

468
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:51,414
they are entitled
to damages.

469
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,580
obviously,
there was negligence.

470
00:36:53,647 --> 00:36:55,981
good, so then they'll have
excuses why they can't go to work.

471
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:59,014
<i>- when i think what
could have happened</i>

472
00:36:59,081 --> 00:37:01,147
to my baby...

473
00:37:01,214 --> 00:37:03,381
oh yes, you, nica.

474
00:37:03,448 --> 00:37:05,580
i'm talking
about you, angel.

475
00:37:05,647 --> 00:37:07,214
oh, god, i wanna
bite those cheeks.

476
00:37:07,281 --> 00:37:11,114
scumbag hillbilly, i
should have kicked his ass.

477
00:37:11,181 --> 00:37:14,047
yeah, and what
did you do? nothing.

478
00:37:14,114 --> 00:37:16,513
i was taking sophia
to the bathroom.

479
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:25,847
mmm, this wine,
tony, you're right.

480
00:37:25,914 --> 00:37:27,547
delicious.

481
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:32,414
i was just thinking
it lost some of its...

482
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,680
i don't know-- pop.

483
00:37:47,314 --> 00:37:49,247
<i>manager.
you gotta move your car.</i>

484
00:37:49,314 --> 00:37:51,880
i said i'm coming.

485
00:37:57,314 --> 00:38:00,580
you redneck fuck. my baby
was on that ride with my wife.

486
00:38:00,647 --> 00:38:03,247
she woke up this morning, she
could barely move her neck.

487
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:06,914
i told the cops, mister. i'm sorry.
insurance will pay your hospital bill.

488
00:38:06,981 --> 00:38:10,480
- $25,000 cash.
- what?

489
00:38:10,547 --> 00:38:12,580
new jersey has stringent
liability laws.

490
00:38:12,647 --> 00:38:14,613
i told the guy who hired me
i'd have to put on

491
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,613
a whole repair crew, work 'em all
night. he wouldn't spring for it.

492
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,047
who, paulie? what are you talking about?

493
00:38:20,114 --> 00:38:22,181
first off, he wouldn't
pay for my "a" fleet.

494
00:38:22,247 --> 00:38:25,147
i leased that to the sorghum
festival down in atlanta.

495
00:38:26,613 --> 00:38:29,613
<i>okay, the results of
the steroid test are in.</i>

496
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,780
- the contestants,
they're all clean.

497
00:38:33,847 --> 00:38:35,780
<i>i want a fair
contest here.</i>

498
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:38,480
<i>no biting each other.</i>

499
00:38:38,547 --> 00:38:41,947
<i>ready, set, mangia.</i>

500
00:38:45,014 --> 00:38:48,448
man, we got some race going
on over here, ladies and gents.

501
00:38:48,513 --> 00:38:50,147
<i>look at 'em go.</i>

502
00:38:50,214 --> 00:38:52,847
<i>hey, cocksucker!</i>

503
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:56,647
you hire some fly-by-night piece
of shit and you don't tell nobody?

504
00:38:56,714 --> 00:38:58,814
- whoa, bobby.
- what the fuck you talking about?

505
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,513
- you know what i'm talking about, you cheap fuck!
- bobby, come on!

506
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,247
everybody wants to get rich,
but you don't scrimp on safety.

507
00:39:05,314 --> 00:39:08,613
- mind your business, bobby.
- my baby girl was in that car!

508
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,147
- you owe me money, paulie.
- i owe you shit.

509
00:39:11,214 --> 00:39:13,613
- my wife's got nerve damage!
- fuck her, too!

510
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,680
- get the fuck off me!
- easy, easy.

511
00:39:15,747 --> 00:39:19,714
calm down.
keep moving.

512
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:30,981
go ahead, it's over.
crown the winner.

513
00:39:31,047 --> 00:39:33,747
i was at the feast,
st. elzear's.

514
00:39:33,814 --> 00:39:36,714
the thing for us kids was
to blow powdered sugar

515
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:39,448
on each other
from the zeppoles.

516
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:46,181
thousands of people
either praying or eating.

517
00:39:47,714 --> 00:39:51,081
<i>anyway, my sister
was on this ride</i>

518
00:39:51,147 --> 00:39:54,114
with my niece
when it lurched forward

519
00:39:54,181 --> 00:39:56,580
- pretty bad.
- god.

520
00:39:56,647 --> 00:39:59,348
he wasn't there,
just elzear.

521
00:39:59,414 --> 00:40:01,714
but he was so busy getting
money pinned to his ass

522
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,714
- that he got distracted
and a bolt snapped.

523
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,047
were they hurt?

524
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:09,081
you look around, all these
people are lined up for this shit.

525
00:40:09,147 --> 00:40:12,247
the kids, adults,
families.

526
00:40:12,314 --> 00:40:14,081
rides.

527
00:40:14,147 --> 00:40:16,547
yeah, they pay money
so they can almost puke.

528
00:40:16,613 --> 00:40:18,714
they scream, they yell.

529
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,081
why do you think that is?

530
00:40:21,147 --> 00:40:23,181
they're bored.

531
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,680
are you bored?

532
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,547
am i bored?

533
00:40:37,947 --> 00:40:40,814
i got shot in the pancreas
and i recovered.

534
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,880
no brain damage
from the septic shock,

535
00:40:42,947 --> 00:40:45,613
like everybody
figured i'd have.

536
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,414
you know my feelings.
every day is a gift.

537
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,214
it's just...

538
00:40:52,281 --> 00:40:56,214
does it have to be
a pair of socks?

539
00:41:00,181 --> 00:41:02,814
i'm joking.

540
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,780
i'm joking.

541
00:41:12,814 --> 00:41:14,580
well, what are
you gonna do?

542
00:41:14,647 --> 00:41:16,647
it's the human
condition.

543
00:41:16,714 --> 00:41:18,613
what is?

544
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,947
i don't know.

545
00:41:25,014 --> 00:41:26,947
<i>yeah, this is peter gaultieri.</i>

546
00:41:27,014 --> 00:41:29,480
<i>i'm calling for the result
of my biopsy again.</i>

547
00:41:29,547 --> 00:41:31,981
<i>i'm sorry, sir.
they're still not in.</i>

548
00:41:32,047 --> 00:41:34,114
this is cancer
we're talking about.

549
00:41:34,181 --> 00:41:37,680
<i>i understand, sir. you'll
have to call back tomorrow.</i>

550
00:41:45,714 --> 00:41:47,647
gimme an espresso...

551
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:50,414
and don't touch the lemon
rind with your fingers.

552
00:41:55,147 --> 00:41:57,014
hello, paulie.

553
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:59,047
what are you
doing here?

554
00:41:59,114 --> 00:42:02,381
the home. it's one
of our outings.

555
00:42:02,448 --> 00:42:04,181
so you're still
over there, huh?

556
00:42:04,247 --> 00:42:06,381
they've been very nice,

557
00:42:06,448 --> 00:42:09,480
and your brother's trying
to work out an arrangement.

558
00:42:09,547 --> 00:42:13,613
is it true
what they're saying?

559
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,147
who? about what?

560
00:42:16,214 --> 00:42:17,947
the ride,
the one that broke.

561
00:42:20,547 --> 00:42:22,680
you need to make
a novena, paulie.

562
00:42:22,747 --> 00:42:25,381
<i>- those poor children.
- what are you talking about?</i>

563
00:42:25,448 --> 00:42:28,680
you let st. elzear
go without his hat.

564
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:31,214
will you listen to this?
fuck that voodoo, huh?

565
00:42:31,281 --> 00:42:34,181
you cursed your mother,
a blessed nun.

566
00:42:34,247 --> 00:42:36,181
she had it coming.
you both did.

567
00:42:36,247 --> 00:42:38,680
i didn't bring
you up like that.

568
00:42:38,747 --> 00:42:40,914
you're a fake. that's
how you brung me up.

569
00:42:40,981 --> 00:42:42,981
fuck the two of you.

570
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:47,348
sir, your espresso.

571
00:42:51,114 --> 00:42:54,714
so in keeping with this
longstanding tradition

572
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:58,247
of doing everything
ass-fucking-backwards,

573
00:42:58,314 --> 00:43:01,747
we are gathered here tonight for the
bachelor party of already-married man

574
00:43:01,814 --> 00:43:03,513
christopher moltisanti.

575
00:43:06,647 --> 00:43:09,014
and like i always say,

576
00:43:09,081 --> 00:43:11,247
a man is not complete
till he's married.

577
00:43:11,314 --> 00:43:13,513
then he's finished.

578
00:43:15,613 --> 00:43:17,448
chrissy.

579
00:43:17,513 --> 00:43:20,247
- congratulations. t.
- thanks.

580
00:43:35,314 --> 00:43:37,047
should we order?

581
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:40,547
- yeah, what the fuck are the specials?
- artie.

582
00:43:44,814 --> 00:43:48,281
i gotta go, ton'.
the kids.

583
00:43:51,147 --> 00:43:53,947
- have fun tonight, huh?
- all right.

584
00:43:55,513 --> 00:43:58,381
- specials, gentlemen.
- pray tell, my good man.

585
00:43:58,448 --> 00:44:01,780
i got lamb tonight, grilled,
garlic, little rosemary.

586
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,747
rosemary,
i'll eat her.

587
00:44:12,448 --> 00:44:14,580
hey, t.

588
00:44:14,647 --> 00:44:16,680
you're doing a heck
of a job there, brownie.

589
00:44:16,747 --> 00:44:19,513
huh?

590
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,747
this thing with the ride,
the shit with bobby,

591
00:44:21,814 --> 00:44:23,880
you settle it
and you settle it now.

592
00:44:23,947 --> 00:44:26,348
and not just 'cause
she's my sister, either.

593
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:28,348
- ton', i-- - you put
little kids in jeopardy

594
00:44:28,414 --> 00:44:31,047
at the hands
of some fucking redneck?

595
00:44:31,114 --> 00:44:33,780
not to mention you leave little
paulie alone to deal with the cops.

596
00:44:33,847 --> 00:44:37,147
i thought he had it
under control.

597
00:44:37,214 --> 00:44:39,147
let me ask you a question
about the feast.

598
00:44:39,214 --> 00:44:41,348
do we need negative press?

599
00:44:41,414 --> 00:44:43,314
with all the competition
out there

600
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:45,281
for the entertainment
dollar, dvds,

601
00:44:45,348 --> 00:44:47,680
the internet?

602
00:44:47,747 --> 00:44:49,814
you're right, ton'.

603
00:44:52,381 --> 00:44:54,314
what happened to
the regular ride guy,

604
00:44:54,381 --> 00:44:56,780
the guy we used
last year?

605
00:44:56,847 --> 00:45:00,114
for what he wanted to charge,
i'm getting killed here, ton'.

606
00:45:00,181 --> 00:45:02,448
when your dad had st.
elzear's, it was a cash cow,

607
00:45:02,513 --> 00:45:06,181
and it was easy. nowadays,
between paying the church,

608
00:45:06,247 --> 00:45:07,847
<i>these puerto ricans now,</i>

609
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:10,147
ha, my profit shrunk
to nothing.

610
00:45:10,214 --> 00:45:12,414
if it don't work as a
business, get rid of it.

611
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,381
not for nothing, but a lot of
that feast goes in your pocket.

612
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:19,513
i got a lot
on my mind, t.

613
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:22,680
- i'm sorry.
- like what?

614
00:45:22,747 --> 00:45:25,914
i had a biopsy.

615
00:45:25,981 --> 00:45:28,513
i might have
prostate cancer.

616
00:45:30,381 --> 00:45:33,147
<i>well, it's a biopsy,
right?</i>

617
00:45:33,214 --> 00:45:35,647
nine times out of 10, these
things come back clean.

618
00:45:35,714 --> 00:45:38,981
- i don't know.
- what don't you know?

619
00:45:39,047 --> 00:45:42,480
don't work yourself up into
a state like you do, hmm?

620
00:45:42,547 --> 00:45:44,680
i've been having headaches.

621
00:45:44,747 --> 00:45:47,880
i'm afraid maybe the thing
metastasized.

622
00:45:47,947 --> 00:45:50,314
jesus, will you
listen to yourself, huh?

623
00:45:50,381 --> 00:45:54,047
with all your weird fucking shit
about your body and the germophobias.

624
00:45:54,114 --> 00:45:57,847
- you don't know shit yet.
- it's true.

625
00:45:57,914 --> 00:46:00,747
i'd rather face 10 guys with
shivs than something i can't see.

626
00:46:00,814 --> 00:46:03,647
exactly. you're too
susceptible to the psychics

627
00:46:03,714 --> 00:46:06,547
and the dream messages and
dirty fucking toilet seats.

628
00:46:06,613 --> 00:46:08,647
it's a biopsy.

629
00:46:08,714 --> 00:46:10,847
get a grip.

630
00:46:10,914 --> 00:46:13,547
you're right, t.

631
00:46:13,613 --> 00:46:16,613
you know, and negative thinking
can help bring this shit on.

632
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:20,680
<i>work something out
with bobby, huh?</i>

633
00:46:20,747 --> 00:46:22,847
and eddie lind's coming down from
pennsylvania with an envelope.

634
00:46:22,914 --> 00:46:24,847
meet him at the bing.

635
00:46:24,914 --> 00:46:27,281
you call him,
you set up a time.

636
00:46:34,314 --> 00:46:37,014
there he is,
the bad lieutenant.

637
00:46:37,081 --> 00:46:38,613
hey.

638
00:46:41,647 --> 00:46:43,480
i sold mine.

639
00:46:43,547 --> 00:46:46,814
$300 for the five cases.

640
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:57,480
oh, i had a heater put in
the bloomfield wire room.

641
00:46:57,547 --> 00:46:59,780
guys were complaining.

642
00:46:59,847 --> 00:47:02,214
well, good.

643
00:47:02,281 --> 00:47:05,014
yeah, yeah,
that's good.

644
00:47:12,181 --> 00:47:14,147

645
00:47:14,214 --> 00:47:16,448
copasetic.

646
00:47:28,847 --> 00:47:31,114
"we're with the vipers."

647
00:47:36,281 --> 00:47:38,981
- fun night.
- fuckin' a.

648
00:47:40,414 --> 00:47:43,480
"take it easy.
take it easy."

649
00:47:43,547 --> 00:47:46,348
10-4.

650
00:47:46,414 --> 00:47:49,547
you remember the look
on the other guy's face?

651
00:47:49,613 --> 00:47:52,814
oh, the fucking grizzly
adams douche bag.

652
00:48:01,147 --> 00:48:04,214
yeah.

653
00:48:18,314 --> 00:48:20,214
<i>dr. cipolla's service.</i>

<i>dr. cipolla's out of town.

00:50:40,247 --> 00:50:43,281
i've picked out something
with a little norwegian flavor.

681
00:50:43,348 --> 00:50:46,181
<i>- i'd like to play for you
the "johnny oslo shadish."</i>

682
00:50:46,247 --> 00:50:48,747
<i>it's a typical norwegian dance,
and who could do it better</i>

683
00:50:48,814 --> 00:50:51,314
<i>than bobby and cissy?</i>

684
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,914
paulie?
i don't wanna argue.

685
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,281
what are you watching?

686
00:51:19,348 --> 00:51:22,981
the "lawrence welk" program,
chanl 55.

687
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,181
you want some cookies?
