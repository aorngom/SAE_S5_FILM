1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,000
# You woke up
this morning #

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,500
# Got yourself a gun #

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,600
# Your momma always said
you'd be the Chosen One #

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,000
# She said you're...
you're one in a million #

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,300
# You've got
to burn to shine #

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,300
# But you were
born under a bad sign #

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,100
# With a blue moon
in your eyes #

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,900
# When you
woke up this morning #

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,800
# And all that love
had gone #

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,000
# Your papa never
told you about #

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,500
# Right and wrong #

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,800
# But you're...
you're lookin' good, baby #

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,200
# I believe that
you're feelin' fine #

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,900
# Shame about it,
born under a bad sign #

15
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,400
# With a blue moon
in your eyes #

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,700
- # So sing it now #
- # Woke up this morning #

17
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,300
# Got a blue moon...
got a blue moon in your eyes, yeah #

18
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,300
# Woke up this morning #

19
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,600
# You say you woke up
this morning #

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,700
# The world
turned upside down #

21
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,000
# Lordy, well,
things ain't been the same #

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,300
# Since the blues
walked in our town #

23
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,700
# But you're... but you're
one in a million #

24
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,200
# 'Cause you got that
shotgun shine #

25
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,200
# Shame about it,
born under a bad sign #

26
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,200
# With a blue moon
in your eyes, yeah #

27
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,200
# Woke up
this morning #

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,400
- # Uh-huh #
- # And got yourself a gun #

29
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,400
- # Woke up this morning #
- # Got yourself a gun #

30
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,000
- # Uh-huh #
- # Got yourself a gun. #

31
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,100
# Every night
it's the same #

32
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,300
# I hear your heart
turn cold as rain #

33
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,600
# And although
you'll be gone again #

34
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,300
# I hear
the front door close #

35
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,600
# You say you
got to go downtown #

36
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,500
# I guess there's
someone else you found #

37
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,500
# So why you're
still comin' round #

38
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,400
# Heaven only knows #

39
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,600
# Heaven only
knows just why #

40
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,500
# Lovin' you
should make me cry #

41
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,500
# Make me feel
like I could die #

42
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,800
# That's the way it goes #

43
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,200
# Heaven only ever sees #

44
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,200
# How love's made
a fool of me #

45
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,200
# I guess that's how
it's meant to be #

46
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,200
# But heaven only knows. #

47
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,400
AJ!

48
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,600
Jesus, Meadow,
chill out!

49
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,300
Inevitably, Sukanya,
what goes in must comes out.

50
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,800
And these people now being released
from prison were jailed

51
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,300
during the big mafia
crackdowns of the 1980s?

52
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,300
Seems like yesterday,
doesn't it?

53
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,000
For years we heard how law enforcement
broke the back of the mob.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,900
Well, they've
served their time.

55
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,100
"It's the old never-ending
battle against crime and corruption,"

56
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,300
- to quote Superman.
- What do you think is gonna happen

57
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,000
with this infusion
of new blood?

58
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,300
We could be looking at a period
of potentially violent struggle.

59
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,500
- They gonna paint everythin' the worst.
- How long till dinner?

60
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,500
- Any familiar names?
- In New York, the only old-style boss

61
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,500
still in place
is Carmine Lupertazzi.

62
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,300
He'll soon be rejoined by Angelo Garepe,
his former consigliere.

63
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,200
Also Philip Leotardo,
long-time Lupertazzi captain.

64
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,600
Can you help me here?
Crush some ice?

65
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,500
- I'll be right there.
- New Jersey's a better case in point.

66
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,700
You've got
Michele "Feech" La Manna,

67
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,200
released just this week,
a man greatly feared

68
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,900
- and respected in the '70s.
- Amen to that.

69
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,400
Similar situation with Anthony Blundetto
in that same

70
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,600
- Jersey crime family, the Sopranos.
- Oh!

71
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,500
- Let me see how he looks.
...still is as far as I know.

72
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,400
28 years old when he went away.

73
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
A rising star.
Thought to be the central suspect

74
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,400
in the car-bomb killing
of Thomas Gilardi and his driver.

75
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,700
That's the best picture they could find?
He was a fox.

76
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,600
Will you pipe down?
We're tryin' to watch.

77
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,300
It's my house, Tony.

78
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,300
- What are you watching?
- Go call your brother for dinner.

79
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,900
- Bobby!
- Be nice to have him back, huh?

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,500
- Your cousin?
- Missed the shit out of him.

81
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,800
The older you are, the more
you're entitled to eat.

82
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Hi, sorry.

83
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,200
- Where the hell you been?
- Your mother didn't send anything?

84
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,400
She wasn't even home. Her and Aunt Ro
went out to dinner, I think.

85
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,300
Everybody sit!

86
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,800
Now please.

87
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,700
This is great of you,
Aunt Jan,

88
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,800
keeping the Sunday dinner
tradition going.

89
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,800
Can you get the roast
out of the oven?

90
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,700
- Canned clam chowder?
- Go sit, God damn it.

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,100
- Oh, shit.
- What?

92
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,600
My wedding ring.

93
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,700
- Goin' to strap on the bag, Ton'?
- Yeah.

94
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,200
Would you say this is an interesting
point in the history of the mafia?

95
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,600
I'd say we're looking at a great year
for crime reporters, Sukanya.

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,500
- Anthony!
- What?

97
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
I wanna say hello.

98
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,600
Wh... can you stop
a minute?

99
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,000
- How was dinner?
- Fine.

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,500
- What'd you have?
- Roast beef.

101
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,200
Did your father pick up his mail
when he dropped you off?

102
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,100
No, he didn't come in.
He was tired.

103
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,900
He said he just wanted to go to bed.
I'm trying to practice.

104
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,700
I see you didn't bring
the power vac in

105
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,200
from the pool house
like I asked.

106
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,200
Why does that even
have to be done?

107
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,700
Grandpa's still gonna
have to lift it into his truck.

108
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,100
I don't want him to have to drag
it from all the way out back.

109
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,800
# It's so nice to have
a man around the house. #

110
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,000
You should've thought
about that before.

111
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,300
What did you say?

112
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,600
Go out and get
that vacuum, now!

113
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,100
What did I
just say?! Go!

114
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,100
Mommy!

115
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,300
Oh my God.
Mommy, help!

116
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,700
Mommy! Mom.

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,700
Mommy.

118
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,900
AJ, be quiet,
don't move.

119
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,600
Mommy?

120
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,400
Mommy!

121
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,600
Go get Dad's gun!

122
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,500
It's all the way
in the dining room!

123
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,700
Hey, go away! Go!

124
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,200
Hey! Get outta here!

125
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,000
Go!

126
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,700
How's the olive loaf?

127
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,500
You know what I like?

128
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,100
- I like the Gulden's Brown Mustard.
- Are you leaving?

129
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,200
Yeah, I got a overseas
call comin' at home.

130
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,200
Finish your sandwich,
at least, first.

131
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,000
- Oh, yeah, yeah, no.
- Sheesh.

132
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,100
Could be the same one
from Willow Drive.

133
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,900
God. The most densely
populated state in the country,

134
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,100
- and still this.
- Gone.

135
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,300
He went through your neighbor's
garbage, though, the Kalcheims?

136
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,900
It's been goin' on all over.
If my son had been alone...

137
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,800
You're not gonna
put your trash cans out

138
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,800
until as close
to pick-up time as possible.

139
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,700
- You hear that?
- Put ammonia or bleach

140
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,200
in the container and on the lid.
I posted a notice for your neighbors.

141
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,900
If this had been
a category two,

142
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,900
injury or serious
property damage,

143
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,900
- we could set traps, but not for this.
- God.

144
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,400
You should've busted a cap
in his ass with Dad's rifle.

145
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,500
It's illegal to discharge firearms
within the borough limits.

146
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,300
- You're gonna call Dad, aren't you?
- No.

147
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,000
The great percentage
of them don't come back.

148
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,800
If he does...
call us.

149
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,200
Oh, do you have
bird feed back there?

150
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,100
Ah, duck food,
yes, my husband's.

151
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,000
It's probably what
attracted the animal.

152
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,200
See, the corn's gotten
damp and aromatic.

153
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,100
You might wanna tell
your husband to put it inside.

154
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,100
Right.

155
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,900
Setting up the equipment
is a complicated affair.

156
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,800
Video cameras
with built-in recorders...

157
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,500
- Then the car that he qualifi...
- Hello.

158
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,600
Mmm.

159
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm Dr. Lowenstein.

160
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,200
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Go back.
- What?

161
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,200
- Come on.
- You're kidding.

162
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,900
No, go back, please!

163
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
- Why don't you come in?
- I like Nolte.

164
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,500
- Why didn't you tell me last night?
- I'm sorry.

165
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,500
That's a long story,
let's just skip it.

166
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,100
I'll try to think
of a better one.

167
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,100
- What's bothering you?
- Global warming, acid rain,

168
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,700
the national debt?
Never even know what's goin' on.

169
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,800
Look at her nails,
totally real.

170
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,300
- You weren't paying attention.
- Let's face it,

171
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,200
women are more
devious than men.

172
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,200
One of my therapists
was a woman.

173
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,300
Too bad you didn't get
all your talkin' done with her.

174
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,400
You expect a man to be
a tower of strength.

175
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,900
Then when it turns out he's got a few
weaknesses and some insecurities,

176
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
what do you do?
You turn around and you betray him!

177
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
So you feel that
your mother betrayed you?

178
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,600
Doggone, I hate
this Freudian crap.

179
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,000
It's not your job to listen
to my problems anyway!

180
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,100
If you don't mind,
I'd like to go.

181
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,400
- You're free to leave anytime you want.
- Good!

182
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,500
Goddamn shrink.

183
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,800
- Who was I kiddin'?
- What are you smiling at?

184
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,000
- I was a champion...
- Nothin', I don't know.

185
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,300
- You have this goofy look on your face.
- Come on.

186
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,000
...until Susan Lowenstein
came along.

187
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,600
Her questions makin' me
as dizzy as her perfume.

188
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,800
- Jennifer Melfi?
- Yes?

189
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So we open
the fuckin' trunk,

190
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,100
this suffocatin'
Russian cocksucker pops up!

191
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,300
He's still alive!

192
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,500
We lead him through the snow.
This asshole's shiverin'...

193
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,400
he's wearin' fuckin' pajamas
and slippers in like 8° weather.

194
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,400
- Hey!
- Ho!

195
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,000
- Here he is.
- How you doin'?

196
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,400
- Fellas?
- The B?

197
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,200
- Hey, Ton'.
- Radio on the way in.

198
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,000
- Another incident at the airport.
- Fuckin' assholes.

199
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,500
I gotta make
a couple calls.

200
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,300
Anyway, he starts
runnin', the Russian.

201
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,000
Boom! I'm tellin' you the top of his
head came off like a fuckin' bad rug.

202
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,800
What a beating we had to give
this prick, ooh Madonn'.

203
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,500
- Where is he now?
- Who the fuck cares, right, Chrissie?

204
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,300
- Who the fuck knows?
- Poor bastard.

205
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,900
Never would've happened if Paulie
hadn't initially overreacted,

206
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,700
but it's one
for the books.

207
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,500
What do you mean
overreacted?

208
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,200
You choked him with the lamp,
Paulie, or we could've got

209
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,300
Silvio shcarole without havin'
to spend the night in the open.

210
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,900
You let him jab you with that shovel
was the problem. Lets his guard down.

211
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,900
We would've caught up
to the prick

212
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,200
- if you didn't lose your fuckin' shoe!
- Wait, you lost your shoe?

213
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,300
You didn't tell us about that.

214
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,300
"Chrissie, please, don't leave
me out here."

215
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,000
You little cocksucker!

216
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,400
I covered your ass with Tony
about that whole thing,

217
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
and never a word
of fuckin' thanks, ever!

218
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,900
Always playin' that
blood-relation card.

219
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,200
- Tony's little favorite.
- Fuck you!

220
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,100
- What?
- Come on! Come on.

221
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,700
What the fuck?

222
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,600
That was a good story,
damn it.

223
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,700
Tellin' you right now...

224
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,000
it's finished with us.

225
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,100
- Goodbye, Dr. Melfi.
- See you next week.

226
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
- Hello?
- Like the flowers?

227
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And yeah, before you ask,
I am takin' the medication.

228
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,600
How are you, Anthony?
It's been a long time.

229
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,900
I'm great,
actually. You?

230
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,300
Thank you for that
beautiful arrangement.

231
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,500
I see you haven't lost
your sense of humor.

232
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,000
You gotta have a sense of humor
in life, right?

233
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
- You taught me that.
- And how is life?

234
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Good, good.

235
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,100
Well, I'm separated,
me and Carmela.

236
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,800
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Don't be,

237
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,800
Well, I always thought
I saw some good things there.

238
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,100
Two healthy kids,
other than that...

239
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,900
look, the reason
I called...

240
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,100
I'd like you to have
dinner with me.

241
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,600
Since we're not in therapy no more
and I'm a bachelor again...

242
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,700
That's very
thoughtful of you.

243
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,700
Unfortunately, because of our prior
clinical relationship,

244
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,600
- I just can't do it.
- What, eat?

245
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,400
- You must be a toothpick.
- You know what I mean.

246
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,600
See, I knew you were gonna say
somethin' like that.

247
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
I can't, Anthony,
I'm sorry.

248
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,000
You know, I waited
a respectable period or whatever

249
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,100
- before makin' this call.
- Then you realize yourself

250
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,600
there's something not
quite right about us dating.

251
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,900
No, I'm not
undeterred by this.

252
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,400
- We will talk again.
- Thank you for the flowers.

253
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,300
- And the detergent.
- And the detergent.

254
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,900
Of course,
what's wrong with me?

255
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,500
I don't know,
but we'll find out.

256
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,900
Leave it to Dr. Tony.

257
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,200
- What's the matter?
- The bear. Stay there!

258
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,300
Oh, right,
lock the door.

259
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,800
What, do you think
he's gonna wipe his feet, too?

260
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,300
He'll smash
through the glass.

261
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,700
Now where is
that guy's card?

262
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,100
I don't know.

263
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,500
You've reached Fish and Game.

264
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,400
- If you know the extension...
- Unbelievable.

265
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,100
If not, press zero
for directory.

266
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,900
Hello?!

267
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,400
For hunting and fishing
licenses, press two.

268
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,400
You get a letter from
my cousin in the can?

269
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,600
Yes, Officer Zmuida, hi.
Yes, Mrs. Soprano from North Caldwell?

270
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,100
- We had the bear in our yard.
- What the fuck?

271
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,300
- You're the guys with the pool?
- Yes, it came back.

272
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,000
- Was anybody hurt?
- No, thank God.

273
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,200
- Property damage?
- No property damage either I could see,

274
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,000
but I didn't really
wanna go out there.

275
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,000
Oh, one of those
Eastern black bears?

276
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,700
- We'll be up in about an hour.
- Yes, that'd be great,

277
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,000
- Okay, we'll be here.
- All right, see you then.

278
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,900
Jesus Christ,
when did this happen?

279
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,200
The first time Sunday night,
and I saw it again just now.

280
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,900
AJ didn't even
mention it to you

281
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,800
- when you two went to the game?
- No!

282
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,900
I have to warn
the Cusamanos.

283
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,500
They keep Esterhaz chained up
along the side there.

284
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
That bear will
rip him to pieces.

285
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,200
Cusamanos weren't home.
Got the machine.

286
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,400
Well, I don't
see Esterhaz.

287
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,300
Why didn't you call me
when this first happened?

288
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,300
I called the cops.
They called Fish and Game.

289
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,400
Are you tryin'
to prove you're independent?

290
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,500
This isn't "Little House on the
Prairie." Those things are dangerous.

291
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,700
The ranger, whatever, said it was your
duck food out there that attracted it.

292
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,100
I never heard of that
happening before.

293
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,300
Trapper Joe over here.

294
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,200
Hmm.

295
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,800
We didn't find a spoor.

296
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,000
I was just tellin' the gentleman
the animal still doesn't meet

297
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,100
- the parameters for removal.
- Oh, Jeez.

298
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,400
So, when somebody's
leg is gone...

299
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,800
Problem is it hasn't
really threatened anybody.

300
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,400
Sorry.

301
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,400
Whoa, whoa,
hold on a minute.

302
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,900
You and your pal
buy some new...

303
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,600
lanyards for
your whistles.

304
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,600
Oh, we can't
accept that.

305
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,600
And we don't
have whistles.

306
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,600
Thanks, though.

307
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,100
Ranger Rick's a little light
in the timberlands, huh?

308
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,500
Everybody's always
gay with you.

309
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,200
He's a good-looking guy,
that's all.

310
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,900
I already put
the ammonia on the cans,

311
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,900
I told you.

312
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,200
Look, I came here
to give you your money, but...

313
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,000
this bear thing,
though, I'm... I'm...

314
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm worried.

315
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You and AJ here
by yourselves.

316
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What can we do?
You want coffee?

317
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Last time it had
a weird taste.

318
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,300
The coffeemaker
is shot.

319
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,400
The heating element
is corroded, I told you.

320
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,600
That's not the problem.
You don't need another one.

321
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,200
Last month, it was
the upstairs toilet. Basta.

322
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,600
He goes down the street
to Willow Drive, too,

323
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,600
maybe he'll
stay down there.

324
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,700
All right, look,

325
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,500
you and AJ, you check
yourself into a hotel

326
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,100
until this thing blows over. Here's
1,200 extra on top of our agreement.

327
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,100
- I'm not going to a hotel.
- Why not?

328
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,100
I don't wanna break
Anthony's routines.

329
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,500
He'll get a kick out of it.
It's an adventure.

330
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,700
God knows he loves
room service.

331
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,400
Yeah, I'll give him room service...
the end of my foot.

332
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,900
What's with the attitude?

333
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,800
Well, he's an asshole,
that's what.

334
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,700
- So what? It's his age.
- Yeah, thank you, I know.

335
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,400
But you buy him
too much stuff,

336
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,000
I think because you feel
guilty about the separation.

337
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,900
Excuse me.
It wasn't my idea.

338
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,900
There is more than one way
to ask for something.

339
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,500
- Could we please not?
- Spend $5,000 on a set of drums...

340
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,100
SAT tutor, coffeemaker,
I gotta fight you tooth and nail.

341
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,000
All I said was
I wanna see statements

342
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,900
from the tutor
or he doesn't get paid!

343
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,500
He's a college kid, Tony,
he's not set up for that.

344
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,800
You worried he's gonna
soak you for an extra pencil?

345
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,100
Oh, rimshot!

346
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,100
What I think, Tony, is you're
trying to make my life now

347
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,100
as hard on me
financially as possible.

348
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,900
- Oh, it should be easy.
- Unbelievable.

349
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,300
What do you think,
you're the only Catholic here?

350
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,400
I'm old school. I don't believe in this
separation shit and divorce,

351
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,600
even if my wife was going
after some fucking immigrant!

352
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,600
Yet you are modern enough to use
a cell phone to call Italy

353
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,400
and every other fucking place
to threaten the guy's life.

354
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,900
Oh, that's right.
Certain people see him,

355
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,900
- he's a dead man.
- He had coffee here, Tony, that's all.

356
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,900
And now
the coffeemaker sucks.

357
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,700
How do you like
them apples?

358
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,500
You don't wanna stay at a hotel,
you suit yourself.

359
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,000
This is Anthony.

360
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,100
Could you call me
at 973-555-1299?

361
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,200
I'm thinking maybe
I gotta come back,

362
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:38,000
you know,
for therapy.

363
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,700
- Smells good, Feech.
- Yeah?

364
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,300
- You want a taste?
- Nah, I'll wait.

365
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:48,100
No offense, kid, but don't look to me
like you do a lot of waiting.

366
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,500
Just like
his old man, huh?

367
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,700
Lotta changes since
you went away, huh?

368
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,800
20 years, Madonn'.

369
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,400
Know what the biggest change for me is?
Broads shaving their bushes.

370
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,500
I went over to Silvio's, it's like
the Girl Scouts over there.

371
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,600
I think I'll let
this simmer a bit.

372
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,100
Must be different in the can now,
not like the old days.

373
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,100
Fuckin' animals.

374
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,200
It's all about
setting a precedent.

375
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,900
First day there,
I walk in a mess,

376
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,900
I'm wearin' a puss,
a fuckin' scowl.

377
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,200
I look around...

378
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,200
My nephew.

379
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,400
Right in the middle
of my story!

380
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,700
There he is,
the man, the legend,

381
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,500
Feech La Manna.

382
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,800
Hey, my God
look at you!

383
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,900
You big galoot!

384
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,500
What'd you go straight
from the joint to Earl Scheib?

385
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,200
Look at this fucking tan.

386
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,400
You close the cellar door
when you came up?

387
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,400
It's like the Bowery Boys in here
with this house arrest here.

388
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,700
Code words
and secret passages.

389
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,400
- He's in the middle of a story.
- When isn't he?

390
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,500
Hey.

391
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,900
It's day one,
I'm in the mess,

392
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,800
I look around
and I spot

393
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,500
the biggest, blackest motherfucker
that I can find.

394
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,600
Everybody's looking at me
and I walk right up to him and I say,

395
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,300
"What the fuck are you looking at?"
He says, "What?"

396
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,100
I said, "You heard me,
motherfucker.

397
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,200
What the fuck
are you looking at?!"

398
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,500
With that, I hit him! Bam!
Right across the fucking coconut!

399
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,300
He goes down,
I'm on top of him.

400
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,700
Everybody around!
He gets some shots in.

401
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,800
Everybody's going
fucking crazy!

402
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,900
The screws,
this guy, everybody!

403
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,000
"Motherfucker!"

404
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,200
From that time on,

405
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,200
nobody so much as
looks at me cross-eyed!

406
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,000
- Well, welcome home, huh?
- Cent'anni.

407
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:41,000
- Welcome home.
- Welcome home.

408
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,000
The reason I wanted to see you,
Junior, Tony too,

409
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,000
now that I'm out,
I'd like to get back in the game.

410
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,100
What'd you
have in mind?

411
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,900
You know me,
I'm an entrepreneur.

412
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,900
Get my shy going,
sports book, whatever you say.

413
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,400
As long as you don't
step on anybody's toes.

414
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,600
Me?
I'm Fred Astaire.

415
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,400
What's this
Feech tells me,

416
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,500
you got a bear
up there at the house?

417
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,300
What, it's on fucking CNN?

418
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,300
No, it's just that your wife's up there,
and the kids...

419
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,200
your ex-wife, whatever.
It's just that wild animals,

420
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,400
they're dangerous.
People talk.

421
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,200
What people? Who?

422
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,300
I don't know.

423
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:39,300
What am I supposed to do, go up there
personally and set fucking bear traps?

424
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,400
We're separated,
for Christ's sake.

425
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,200
So, where's the dinner at?

426
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,000
Oh, I forget the name.
It's in the car.

427
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Who's gonna be there?

428
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,100
What are you,
on the school paper? Guys.

429
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,400
It's business.

430
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,100
- You got any cash?
- Some.

431
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,200
Hand me my bag.

432
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,200
- That's all you got?
- It's like $400.

433
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,000
I'm low man tonight,
I gotta pay for everybody.

434
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,500
You know, this is fucking
ridiculous, Christopher.

435
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,700
Why should you get stuck all the time?
You should make Paulie pay.

436
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,300
What, I make the rules now?
Guy's a captain.

437
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,600
I know, but when
he was in jail...

438
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,400
All's I'm saying is if you get
the extra responsibilities,

439
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,200
you should get
the benefits, too.

440
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,100
You're right.

441
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,900
I'll say hello
to the guys from you.

442
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,600
Benny, hi!
Come on in.

443
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,000
Tony sent me. He says he wants somebody
stationed in the yard.

444
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,300
- He's worried the bear might come back.
- What?

445
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,400
- No, I don't want this.
- We'll switch off,

446
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,700
- me and Paulie Germani.
- This is silly, I'm gonna call him.

447
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,800
Actually, it's not
that silly, Mrs. S.

448
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,200
If it was my family, I'd wanna know
there was a male at the house, too.

449
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,300
What can you do about it
if it does come back?

450
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,200
Tony said you should
unlock the closet,

451
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,400
- give me the "shkupit" he called it.
- Oh, for God's sake.

452
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,100
We'll call
the Fish and Game, too.

453
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,700
It's just... I'll have
the weapon in case.

454
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,800
He's just worried
about you, that's all.

455
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,300
And Anthony.

456
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,000
Okay, I don't know.

457
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,200
You're very nice
to do this.

458
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,200
Nice got nothing
to do with it.

459
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,700
Stay inside. You don't have to sit
out there like a fistful of dollars.

460
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,700
Tony said not in the house.
I got my little Sony in the car.

461
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,100
You want something to eat?
We were just about to sit down.

462
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,100
Nah, I'm good.
I just stopped at Tio Pepe's.

463
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,900
This freaking olive oil.
The food's drenched.

464
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,600
That's the reason
it happened.

465
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,600
As far as fucking bears
are concerned?

466
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,500
I say get rid
of them all.

467
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,200
They had their turn,
and now we got ours.

468
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,300
That's why dinosaurs
don't exist no more.

469
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,500
- Wasn't it a meteor?
- They're all meat eaters.

470
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,900
- Meteor, meteor.
- Take it easy.

471
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,400
Gentlemen,
whenever you're ready.

472
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,000
- All right, are we set?
- Yeah, sure.

473
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,500
What are you doing,
you ready?

474
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,700
I gotta make
a pit stop.

475
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,700
Eh, you forgetting
something?

476
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,700
You get it.
I got the last one.

477
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,800
Here, baby, have some
more cheesecake.

478
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:53,600
The other thing with bears is: if you're
ever chased by one, run downhill.

479
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,900
- For some reason, they can't do that.
- It's the moss.

480
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,300
They attack when you're
having your period, too.

481
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,600
No, no,
that's jungle cats.

482
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,900
- So can we go?
- Hold your horses.

483
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,800
- What's goin' on, we ready or what?
- Yeah.

484
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,500
- Fine, I'll get it.
- Gimme the fucking thing.

485
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,700
- I said I'll get it.
- Enough. It's done.

486
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,800
- $860.00.
- What?

487
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,300
You heard me.
That's what you owe from last night.

488
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,600
You said, you got it.

489
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,200
I only got like
$100 on me, anyways.

490
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,900
Then get the rest by tonight
or you start paying points.

491
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,400
I'm thinking of going
for the acupuncture.

492
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,600
- What, your shoulder again?
- Those long drives.

493
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,700
- It's already tender.
- Next time, we get you out there.

494
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:10,100
After 18 years in the can,
I'm just happy to be outside.

495
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,800
What, they don't have
a golf course at Leavenworth?

496
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,300
Still a smart ass,
this one.

497
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,200
Carmine,
you all right?

498
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,000
You barely touched
your egg salad.

499
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,300
Too much gherkins.
You smell that?

500
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,200
- What?
- Burning hair.

501
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,200
I smell cut grass.

502
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,000
- Any word on your cousin getting out?
- Who's your cousin again?

503
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,500
- Tony Blundetto.
- Oh, yeah, good guy.

504
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,800
Right, right.
He was my best buddy inside.

505
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,500
- So you gonna give him a party?
- When he get home, get him laid.

506
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,900
What's the matter,
Carmine?

507
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,500
- Carmine?
- Jesus Christ!

508
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,100
- Call an ambulance.
- Yes, sir.

509
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,800
Is he breathing?

510
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,000
- Get that egg salad out of his mouth.
- Hurry up!

511
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,400
- Lupertazzi residence.
- Carmine, it's John.

512
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,100
Hey, John boy,
how's the weather?

513
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,000
Look, I got some bad news.
Your dad's had a stroke.

514
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,500
- Oh my God, how bad?
- There's some paralysis.

515
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,000
It's too early to tell yet.
They're doing everything they can.

516
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,000
- Is my mom there?
- I just called her, she's on her way.

517
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,500
We're over
at St. Vincent's.

518
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,600
Anything, John,
anything he needs.

519
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,300
I'm on the next plane.

520
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,600
Sad, this shit, huh?

521
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,200
I wonder if I can
smoke in here.

522
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:39,200
You know, I haven't forgotten
our arrangement last year,

523
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,600
you leaving me
in the lurch like that.

524
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,800
It was the right thing to do, John.
Taking out a boss? Come on.

525
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,000
- Even still.
- What do you want, an apology?

526
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Fucking Whitman Sampler,
what?

527
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,600
Boy, imagine if his
fucking speech is affected.

528
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,800
Poor bastard.

529
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,600
When you're up at the house,
who comes to visit? Anybody?

530
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,000
Mostly Rosalie Aprile,
Sil's wife.

531
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,700
Who calls on the phone?

532
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,800
Most of the calls seem
to be for Anthony.

533
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,000
So...?

534
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,600
Look, the real
reason I'm here

535
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,800
is to confront you

536
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,300
in a positive way about
taking our relationship

537
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,000
in that other direction.

538
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Why did you have
to be underhanded?

539
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,300
I don't find that
appealing, frankly.

540
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,500
I was gonna ask you out
for coffee or something,

541
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,100
but I didn't think you'd go.

542
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,500
I'll pay for the hour,
that goes without saying.

543
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,100
Forget that.

544
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,200
I was listening
to that guy on TV, Dr. Phil?

545
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,800
And he was talking about
a similar situation

546
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,700
and he said that you could,
if you wanted to.

547
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:49,000
There's no set rules.
It's basically about malpractice,

548
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,100
- and you probably couldn't get sued.
- That's not the point.

549
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,100
Look, I was thinking about
all kinds of moves...

550
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,100
"Buy her a piece
of jewelry.

551
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,100
Pay the guy to close down
the restaurant

552
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,500
where she eats lunch
and hire a mandolin player."

553
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,400
This is the place
where we've been

554
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,600
most honest
with each other.

555
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,400
And that's the way
I always liked it.

556
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,400
So that being said,

557
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,300
if you don't like me
personally,

558
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,100
or the cut of my jib,
or my face, or whatever,

559
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,600
then the matter will end here
and I will never ask you again.

560
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,600
You can be honest.

561
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,800
I like you, Anthony.

562
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,100
And, no, you have
a very nice face.

563
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,000
- Working on the weight, too.
- Good.

564
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,000
Explain to me, okay,

565
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,800
why this is a matter
of such importance to you.

566
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,900
There must be plenty
of women out there.

567
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,900
You're different
from what's out there,

568
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,100
not to mention being
drop-dead beautiful.

569
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,500
My training teaches me
to go fairly quickly

570
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,400
to the idea that what you really
want is to come back to therapy.

571
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,700
Jesus Christ Almighty,
come on, will you?!

572
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,800
Your marriage of 20-something
years has collapsed,

573
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,100
no doubt there are issues
with your children.

574
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,900
Why can't I do something that's just
for me for a change?

575
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,100
It would be for you.

576
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,900
All right,
well, I want you.

577
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,600
And not just for the smart things
you say. I-I-I want...

578
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,900
I want your skin.
I want your mouth.

579
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,900
I want your eyes.

580
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,800
You project all these
qualities onto me.

581
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,300
You don't know me.

582
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,200
This is what happens
between doctor and patient.

583
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,800
Don't do that.

584
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,200
Outta respect
for this office.

585
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,500
You know,
forget about the way

586
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,900
that Tony Soprano
makes his way in the world,

587
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,200
that's just
to feed his children.

588
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,300
There's two Tony Sopranos.

589
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,400
You've never seen
the other one.

590
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,500
That's the one
I wanna show to you.

591
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,500
- Hi.
- Hi.

592
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,900
- l... I wonder if I could use the WC?
- Of course, come on in.

593
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,600
- Yeah, okay.
- Is it cold out?

594
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:24,000
Yeah, a little,
but I got a fleece.

595
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:49,000
I know him, he'll just keep coming
back and coming back.

596
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,000
How to let him
down easy, l...

597
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,200
- Think it's worth telling the police?
- What?

598
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,600
Jesus, Elliot.

599
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,000
I don't want to paint
in somber tones here,

600
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,600
but the man is a sociopath,

601
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,700
unpracticed in not
getting what he wants.

602
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,100
And now, since
the therapy is kaput,

603
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,500
what use are you to him
except for sex?

604
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,400
Thank you, Elliot.

605
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,700
Your depth of feeling is
really quite extraordinary here.

606
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,200
All you could come up with
was this weak borscht

607
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,800
about professional ethics,
because you are worried

608
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,300
about how this thug
will handle rejection.

609
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,100
You know, at first

610
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,000
I did find him a little sexy...

611
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,600
dangerous, alpha male...

612
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,700
but as year followed year,

613
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,000
the ugliness I saw, I heard...

614
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,700
You kept him
a long time, though.

615
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:45,600
There's a mutual sympathy
there of some kind, I guess.

616
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,900
Maybe it's just
the Italian thing.

617
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,200
- Sil said you were looking for me?
- Sit down.

618
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,800
This about
the Easter baskets?

619
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,400
I don't even
know what that is,

620
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,700
and, to tell you the truth,
I don't wanna know.

621
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,000
Now what's this shit
between you and Paulie?

622
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:19,100
- You chiseled him out of a dinner?
- I chiseled him?

623
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,300
- He said that?
- I asked you a question.

624
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,900
Can I say something
in my own defense?

625
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,600
It's not right that
I have to pay all the time.

626
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,800
I've been paying
for fucking years.

627
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:33,200
You done? Good.

628
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,600
You pay till I tell you
you don't have to pay no more.

629
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,300
And don't give me
that face.

630
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,500
You know how many tabs, how many
dinners I picked up over the years?

631
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,800
I got Richie Aprile,
fat fucking Jerry Anastasia.

632
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,400
Those guys killed me
at Benihana's.

633
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,900
And forget it, if they want a steak.
I put a new wing on Peter Luger's.

634
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,700
Brandy, cigars, champagne.

635
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,500
Could've bought
a fucking plane.

636
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,800
I hear you, Ton',
but that was before inflation...

637
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,000
Whatever.

638
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,400
It's tradition.

639
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,600
It's like in ancient times,
the samurais,

640
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,400
they had these pages...

641
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,500
young boys that
did their errands,

642
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,600
washed their clothes,
shit like that.

643
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,200
It's a sign of respect.

644
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,900
Why don't you cheer up?

645
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,800
One day, some kid'll be
paying for your dinners.

646
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,600
Atlantic City loves
its oldies on Oldies 98.3.

647
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,300
# Now that you're gone... #

648
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,700
So the Pope says,
"Just-a one-a more thing:

649
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,900
She gotta have-a
big-a tits."

650
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,800
Oh, man!

651
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,200
That was good!

652
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,600
You okay, Ton'?
You're being like a little quiet.

653
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,000
Yeah, yeah.
I'm just... I'm full, that's all.

654
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,600
Calm before the storm. Get him near
those crap tables and look out.

655
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,500
Jesus, I'm stuffed. I can't remember
the last time I ate this much.

656
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,300
Sure youse don't
want no dessert?

657
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,500
- Not for me.
- I'm good.

658
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,600
Thank you.

659
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,600
- Thanks.
- Enjoy it, girls.

660
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,800
I been enjoying looking
at youse the whole night.

661
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,800
- Get some fucking glasses.
- We gotta go.

662
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,100
All right, I'll see you over
at the $100 table.

663
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,900
- Yeah.
- Right.

664
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,200
Ton', you sure you're all right?
You got a big moose on.

665
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,200
It's a fucking broad,
believe that?

666
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,500
Really?
You mean...?

667
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,700
- It's the real deal, I think.
- No shit, huh?

668
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,400
See? The thing is,

669
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,100
we got this
platonic thing going.

670
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,900
We have had
for many years.

671
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,200
She thinks that's what it is,
but it's not,

672
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,100
and no amount of convincing
will change her mind.

673
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:56,400
- So she was a... friend.
- Yeah.

674
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,300
They're wrapping up a lobster roll
for me to take to Ginny.

675
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,000
- We'll see you's over there.
- Yeah.

676
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,000
- Anything else, gentlemen?
- We're good.

677
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,800
My friend here'll
take the check, though.

678
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,900
Have a wonderful evening.

679
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,700
# Let's get it on #

680
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,000
1184.

681
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,900
Oh... babe.

682
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,600
I gotta play that number.

683
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,600
Hmm, I'm gonna go wash up.

684
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,600
# We're all
sensitive people #

685
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:37,300
# With so much
love to give. #

686
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,900
I'll tell you,
after a meal like that,

687
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,100
what I could use is
a nice piece of ass.

688
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,700
Who knows,
maybe I'll call down,

689
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,300
have them send
one up to the room.

690
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,100
Why don't you just fuck yourself?
Save a little money.

691
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,500
- What's your problem?!
- Stop trying to bait me.

692
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,600
- You know what my fucking problem is!
- No, why don't you tell me?

693
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,600
You want me to tell you? Fine!
Steaks, 3 lb. -lobsters,

694
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,400
the shrimp fucking cocktails
you made everybody get.

695
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,800
Then on top of everything else, you send
those skanks a bottle of Cristal?

696
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,600
I was being a gentleman.
You oughtta try it some time.

697
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,400
Not to mention the Lyonnaise fucking
potatoes you didn't even touch.

698
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,700
- What?! I lost my appetite.
- Fuck you!

699
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,700
- Excuse me?
- You fucking heard me!

700
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,100
I'm telling you, I don't give a fuck
anymore who you're related to.

701
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,700
Go ahead, Paulie.
Go for it.

702
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,400
Your big fucking moment.

703
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,000
- You little fuck...
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

704
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,900
Was there a problem
with the service?

705
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:31,000
- What are you talking about?
- You left me $16, sir.

706
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,500
- Perhaps you miscounted.
- There's 1200 bucks in there.

707
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:38,400
That's correct,
and the bill was $1184.

708
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,900
Assuming you don't tip
on tax or alcohol, 15%...

709
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,500
I'm tapped out.

710
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,600
You think this job is easy?
I have kids.

711
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,800
Then go back inside
before you get hurt.

712
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,900
- I have a goddamn family to support.
- Fuck off.

713
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,400
Yeah, right.
Go piss it away at blackjack,

714
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,500
- fucking assholes!
- Oh!

715
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,600
What do you
gotta say now?

716
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,500
Chrissie, he's fucked up.

717
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:15,700
Don't they have medicine they're
supposed to take, these assholes?

718
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,600
I don't know.

719
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,700
He'll say we hit him
with a brick.

720
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,300
He's still going,
this asshole.

721
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,600
That's my money,
Paulie!

722
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,800
How's he doing?

723
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,600
I love him so much
and I can't do shit.

724
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,100
We're all praying
for him.

725
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,700
You know, you were
another son to him.

726
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,200
- Yeah?
- You get some sleep?

727
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,700
Yeah, a little,
you know.

728
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,600
- Fucked up, huh?
- What are you gonna do?

729
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,900
I'm not too worried
about the cops.

730
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,300
Nobody knows us down there.

731
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,400
The reason I called.

732
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,600
Let's bury the hatchet,
you and me.

733
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,300
All this bullshit
with us.

734
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,900
I know, I know,
it's stupid.

735
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,300
Life's too short,
Chrissie.

736
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,100
You can't waste it
fighting with your friends.

737
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,200
Look what could've
happened last night.

738
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,300
One of us could've got hurt
or even killed for Christ's sake.

739
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,100
- I know.
- You're special to me, you know.

740
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,100
- Always have been.
- You, too, Paulie... to me.

741
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,900
We'll split the tab.

742
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,600
I'm sorry, Paulie.

743
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,600
I apologize too, kid.

744
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,400
I'll talk to you later.

745
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:31,400
When you say that,
you make me feel...

746
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,700
less than.

747
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:39,300
Next week, everyone.

748
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,100
Good luck.

749
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,500
- I'm going outta town next week.
- Okay.

750
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,600
Good night.

751
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,200
Anthony.

752
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,500
- Hello.
- Hey.

753
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,000
A friend of mine
had these.

754
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,800
I'll see you
next week.

755
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,800
Like I was saying, a friend of mine
had these and couldn't use them.

756
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,800
I figured, well...

757
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,900
maybe we could.

758
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,800
Tickets, Bermuda, lodging
at the Elbow Beach Hotel.

759
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I turned down a wonderful
dinner invitation,

760
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,300
and you think
I'll go away with you?

761
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,100
Well, the guy couldn't
use them and...

762
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,000
you know, he gave them to me. What do
you want me to do, throw them away?

763
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,700
Come on, I'm breaking
out the big guns here.

764
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:58,200
You're turning me
into half a stalker.

765
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,000
Listen, Anthony, I'm...

766
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I'm not going to
go out with you, okay?

767
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,400
And it's not because
you're unattractive

768
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,500
or I don't think I
would have a good time,

769
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,800
it's just something
I'm not going to do.

770
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,300
And I would like you
to respect my decision,

771
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:21,000
and just try to feel that
I know what's right for me.

772
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,600
Okay?

773
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,900
But it's not
just the...

774
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:39,300
psychiatric ethics
stuff, is it?

775
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,400
I wanna preserve
the option for you

776
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,600
that you could always
come back to our work,

777
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,300
if you wish.

778
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:49,000
And that we could pick up
where we've left off.

779
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,200
I don't think you
get this, I want you!

780
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,000
And that's very
flattering to me.

781
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,500
I'm not interested
in flattering you.

782
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,700
- I know you're not.
- All right, then what is it?

783
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:01,200
Okay, what is it?
Just...

784
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,200
help me
understand it, okay?

785
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:11,000
You know, Anthony,
during therapy l...

786
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:14,200
I never judged you
or your behavior.

787
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,900
It's not the place
of a therapist to do so.

788
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,900
All right,
I get all this. Go, go.

789
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,300
In a personal relationship,

790
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,600
I don't think
I could sit silent.

791
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,700
About what?

792
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,700
Our values are...

793
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:36,400
- just very different.
- You don't like my values?

794
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,500
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

795
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,800
No.

796
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,800
Okay. Like what?

797
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,000
- It's getting late, l...
- No, no, no. Come on.

798
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,100
It's okay, it's okay.

799
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,300
Well...

800
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,600
you're not
a truthful person.

801
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,900
You're not
respectful of women.

802
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,900
You're not really
respectful of people.

803
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:11,000
- I don't love people?
- Maybe you love them, I don't know.

804
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,700
You take what you want
from them by force

805
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:17,000
or the threat of force.
I couldn't live like that.

806
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,100
- I couldn't bear witness to violence...
- Fuck you!

807
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,100
You're a fucking cunt!

808
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,300
Oh.

809
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,200
How come Benny's
not outside?

810
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,400
He just got here,
he's going out.

811
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Where is he?

812
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:04,100
He's in your office on the phone
with his girlfriend.

813
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,700
Hey, Ton',
how's it going?

814
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,100
You can take the night off.
I'll spell you.

815
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,700
No, no, no, Ton',
that's all right, it's okay, really.

816
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,700
I'll take over,
okay, for tonight.

817
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:21,400
Okay, well...
night, Mrs. S.

818
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,400
Good night, Benny,
thank you.

819
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,500
- You want coffee?
- No.

820
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,800
# I'm gonna turn
and walk away #

821
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,200
# There's nothing left
for me to say #

822
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,000
# It wouldn't
change things anyway #

823
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:05,800
# Oh, I suppose #

824
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:09,200
# The love I gave
was always true #

825
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,600
# Well, I don't know
what else to do #

826
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,600
# And how I'll
ever get over you #

827
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,300
# Heaven only knows #

828
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,300
# Heaven only
knows just why #

829
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:26,100
# Loving you
should make me cry #

830
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:29,000
# Make me feel
like I could die #

831
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:32,800
# That's the way it goes #

832
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,700
# Heaven only ever sees #

833
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:39,500
# How love's
made a fool of me #

834
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,900
# I guess that's how
it's meant to be #

835
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,300
# But heaven only knows #

836
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,200
# Heaven only knows
just why #

837
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,800
# Loving you
should make me cry #

838
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:00,900
# Make me feel
like I could die #

839
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:04,800
# But that's
the way it goes #

840
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,700
# Heaven only ever sees #

841
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:11,500
# How love's
made a fool of me #

842
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:14,400
# I guess that's how
it's meant to be #

843
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:18,300
# But heaven only knows. #
