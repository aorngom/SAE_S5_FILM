1
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:47,432
Who's a big boy?

2
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:02,748
Lilac Personal Shopping.

3
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,251
Hey, you.

4
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:07,518
My cousin came through
on those day- spa certificates.

5
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:10,753
Excellent. How's outside Daffy's, at 11:00?

6
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:12,325
Perfect.

7
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:19,928
You want some lunch?
I was just gonna sit down to a tuna san.

8
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:23,533
- Onions, in the morning?
- Actually, it's 2:00.

9
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,838
I'm going out by the pool.

10
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,249
What, Mom?

11
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,980
You were gonna get up at 8:30
to be at TCBY Yogurt...

12
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:38,148
when the manager got there.

13
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,452
It's, like, five days till school starts.
Why get a job now?

14
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:44,258
I don't know.
A few textbooks you could buy.

15
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,458
Pairs of socks.
Anything that we don't have to supply.

16
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,401
This thing about working
between now and start of classes...

17
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,065
is about you being pissed'cause
I didn't intern at the Paper Mill Playhouse.

18
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,598
We bought you a car so you could
drive back and forth to your internship.

19
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,168
You don't feel bad
that you didn't live up to the deal?

20
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:02,544
Jesus, we've been through this
how many times?

21
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:05,812
There was no stagecraft
in what they had me doing at the Playhouse.

22
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:08,649
Xeroxing does not count
towards a drama minor internship.

23
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,246
Did you call the drama department,
check that out?

24
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,225
I didn't, so can we shitcan
the courtroom theatrics?

25
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:15,454
Watch your mouth.

26
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,723
Like I haven't been through
enough this year.

27
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:20,960
12 credits, 2 semesters in a row,
and I'm not entitled to a summer?

28
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,433
You hardly....

29
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,029
Hello?

30
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,729
Are you kidding?

31
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:30,975
Listen, can I call you back?

32
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,877
You hardly broke a C, Meadow,
your entire second semester.

33
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,976
Maybe you forgot my ex- boyfriend died?

34
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,545
Your grades were going down
while you were still going out with Jackie.

35
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:44,715
Great.

36
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,522
Jesus, did you ever lose a friend at my age?

37
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,789
Did you ever have to grieve
when you were 19?

38
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:53,127
Honey, you should've been working
this summer...

39
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,530
to feel good about yourself...

40
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,661
get your mind off Jackie,
instead of laying out by that pool.

41
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:01,195
I read, Mom, out by that pool.
Probably half the canon.

42
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,975
"The canon." Okay, what is that, now?

43
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:06,938
"Now"?

44
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,180
The great books? Western literature?
Dead white males?

45
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,052
Who even in their reductionism...

46
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,556
have quite interesting things to say
about death and loss.

47
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,854
Maybe more interesting
than what you have to say.

48
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,860
Is Mary Higgins Clark a part of that group?

49
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,489
'Cause that's what I saw you reading
every time I passed by the pool.

50
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,133
Hello?

51
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,626
You're not surprised, are you?

52
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,798
Come on, he's so totally duplicitous.

53
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,873
He had the nerve to come to the pub- crawl?

54
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,508
Can I call you back?

55
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:42,874
Are we done talking?

56
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,179
Did you go on- line
and register for your classes?

57
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,151
- I will.
- Just go.

58
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:53,585
There's some guy in your driveway
with a ponytail.

59
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,321
What is his story?

60
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,792
- Hi, Mrs. Sop'.
- Hello, Misty.

61
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,044
Fur', hi. He'll be down in a second.

62
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:17,514
He's just changing.
He was working outside this morning.

63
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:21,509
- Do you want some coffee?
- Sure.

64
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,116
I'm gonna buy a house, you know?

65
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:28,387
- I didn't. Where?
- Nutley.

66
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:31,756
So you're gonna stay?
You gonna become a citizen, too?

67
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,628
You don't need that.

68
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,661
- How's it going, Ton'?
- Here at Peaceful Acres? Just swell.

69
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,596
I don't got time for coffee.

70
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,300
Drop me off at the mechanic's,
so I can pick up my car.

71
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,742
Then I got an appointment,
and I'll drive myself, all right?

72
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:46,972
Later.

73
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,139
- Say goodbye to Mead' for me.
- Why don't you say goodbye yourself?

74
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:59,717
I'll tell you what a gold mine is,
those Harry Potter books.

75
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:03,751
That's'cause it gives the other kids,
the 98- pound weaklings, some hope.

76
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:05,826
Speaking of 98 pounds...

77
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:09,664
I hear Ginny Sack's getting a 95- pound mole
taken off her ass.

78
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,494
That's some guy's wife, come on!

79
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,469
All right, gentlemen, I got to go.

80
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,609
- Talk to Patsy.
- Happy birthday.

81
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,475
- All right.
- So long.

82
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:25,807
- See you, guys.
- See you, Ton'.

83
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,614
Happy birthday, Al.

84
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:36,121
I understand
we got some business to discuss.

85
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,486
The floor is yours.

86
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:40,756
Go on, tell him.

87
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,330
I drove out to Youngstown
to see Uncle Paulie...

88
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,600
and he was, I don't know...

89
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,034
hoping you could
settle this shit with Ralph...

90
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,339
and the no- show carpenter jobs.

91
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:53,734
Ralph.

92
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:58,950
Okay, for the record,
I had my guy go over the books.

93
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:03,847
We can do maybe two carpenter jobs,
one no- show, one no- work.

94
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:07,686
Two jobs. On a $300 million project?

95
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,488
Come on. What's the real number?

96
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:17,131
What? Am I speaking in tongues, here?
Two. Maybe I can do three.

97
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,028
- My uncle's looking for at least 10.
- I'm talking, here.

98
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:23,265
The guy's in the can.

99
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:27,310
You think you want
to keep him happy, maybe?

100
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,879
All right. Here it is.

101
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,212
And this comes from....

102
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,250
For the duration,
you will give Paulie five carpenter jobs...

103
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,855
two no- shows and three no- works.

104
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:46,126
One of the no- shows,
our friend in Youngstown keeps...

105
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,832
and one, he gives to Chrissy here.

106
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,070
The others, the no- work jobs,
that's for Paulie...

107
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,470
how he wants to distribute them.

108
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,368
It is so decreed.

109
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:01,440
- Now, if there isn't anything else?
- There is something else.

110
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:05,915
With Paulie in the can,
there's a new acting capo of his crew.

111
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,618
It's Chrissy.

112
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,858
That's the way certain people want it...

113
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,623
and we trust there will be no ill will.

114
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,196
This is fucking great! I mean,
I know I'm just the acting, but still--

115
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,430
It's a big responsibility.

116
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,339
I got it covered.

117
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:30,671
First thing I'm doing
is getting wings in my hair.

118
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,909
You know, like Paulie.

119
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,348
I'll talk to you later.

120
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,693
See these crystal paperweights?

121
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,256
Last year, I bought the Christmas gifts...

122
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,029
for the entire Jets front office.

123
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,901
Over 600 of these, shaped like footballs.

124
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:03,574
- You ever get tickets?
- Lost the account.

125
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,469
To better times.

126
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:14,981
That's so adorable,
with the animals shaped like letters.

127
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:19,089
- I know. If I ever have a baby....
- Yeah.

128
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,954
- What?
- Nothing.

129
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,096
Christopher talks about having kids,
once in a while.

130
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:31,669
I don't know.

131
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:36,067
- Where is our angry young man?
- Out with his friends, I guess.

132
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,238
I used to date this one guy, Vinnie.

133
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:43,112
He was more like a fuck buddy,
but he lived on Staten Island.

134
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:47,785
I swear, we'd be in the middle of doing it,
and if his goddamn beeper went off...

135
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,351
then he'd just leave.

136
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,858
I think he was, like,
connected, or something.

137
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,461
He used to carry a gun.

138
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,226
It was probably just to protect himself.

139
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,395
I mean Christopher does, too, sometimes.

140
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:09,305
- When you're in a cash business--
- Stocks is a cash business?

141
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,013
Can I tell you something?

142
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,438
Sure.

143
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,293
I don't think I can have kids.

144
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,194
What? Why?

145
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:39,336
I can't believe I'm telling you this.

146
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:42,299
It's just that I feel really close to you.

147
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:46,075
A long time ago, before Christopher even...

148
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,137
I had an abortion.

149
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,907
I didn't want to. I know it was wrong...

150
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,817
but the guy was such an asshole,
it was really the best thing.

151
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,954
Anyway, there were complications.

152
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,319
My gynecologist says
that there's a good chance...

153
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,886
I won't be able to hold a pregnancy.

154
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:12,435
Oh, God, I can't believe I'm telling you this.

155
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:16,569
Christopher don't even know.
My own mother even.

156
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,935
Sometimes it helps to talk.

157
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,583
They can do incredible things
these days, Ade.

158
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,276
When the time comes...

159
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,753
I know a great ob- gyn
that my sister went to in the city.

160
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,485
Really?

161
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:38,458
You just show up without calling?
I thought you were going out.

162
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:41,792
I'm a man of many mysteries.

163
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:45,460
Danielle, this is Christopher's friend,
Paulie Germani.

164
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,005
Hey, how you doing?

165
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,704
You put this in the back of your freezer,
it'll take out any odors.

166
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:57,039
Go on, buy her a drink somewhere.
I got to talk to my fiancée.

167
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,880
- Some manners?
- I'll call you tomorrow.

168
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,218
So what? You from around here?

169
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,883
Something's wrong with that broad.

170
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,359
- Something's wrong with you.
- Oh, yeah?

171
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,921
Here's what's wrong with me.

172
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,063
Holy shit!

173
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,268
Oh, my God.

174
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:26,709
- These diamonds--
- Harry Winston, baby.

175
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,673
It's got more carats than Bugs Bunny.

176
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,888
I had a great conversation with Silvio today.

177
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,446
What? Tell me.

178
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:43,526
Let's just say that Carmela
ain't gonna be First Lady forever.

179
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,896
Political disagreement is often a catalyst...

180
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,401
leading to violence in a world gone mad.

181
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:54,098
Burning rage in Korea spilled onto the street
with deadly results.

182
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:57,006
Check it out. Guy in the red jacket?

183
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,707
In 10 seconds, that cop's a fucking fireball.

184
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,043
I don't think I want to see this.

185
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,238
Janice!

186
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,377
Fuck, it's my brother.

187
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,614
I'm coming.

188
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,561
What are you doing here?

189
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,624
I was nearby, at Bacala's.
Figured I'd come by, say hello.

190
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:23,895
Good.

191
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:26,701
- How's he doing?
- He's fat.

192
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,936
Faces of Death?

193
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,268
What? Was The Sound of Music
already rented?

194
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,438
It's research for our Christian rock video...

195
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,778
I'm coordinating with the record release.

196
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,318
That Tommy Mottola,
he's one slow motherfucker.

197
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:44,015
- What's it been, about a year?
- Actually, we are not going with Sony.

198
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:47,081
We're considering
a smaller, independent label.

199
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:48,957
Naturally.

200
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:50,951
Got any coffee?

201
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,965
I may only have soymilk.

202
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,129
What?

203
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,983
What do you care?

204
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,713
- It's none of your business, anyhow.
- Ralph Cifaretto?

205
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,789
It's always fucking something with you.

206
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,522
Why don't you stay out
of other people's living rooms?

207
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,063
Jesus Christ.

208
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,278
You look good. Better than last time.

209
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,985
Ralph came through with those jobs.

210
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:02,190
- What did Tony say?
- It was Tony made him do it.

211
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,137
I wished Albert "happy birthday" for you.

212
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,430
Who's been to see my ma?

213
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,410
I don't think anybody, Paulie.

214
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:17,111
Chrissy says
Tony sent her some chocolates.

215
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:21,982
Chrissy said T made a killing
in real estate, down Frelinghuysen.

216
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,748
That assemblyman guy hyped him to it.

217
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,359
Ralph told this funny fucking joke, though...

218
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,157
at Albert's party.

219
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:32,886
He goes:

220
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:36,594
"Ginny Sack had a 95- pound mole...

221
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:39,099
"surgically taken off her ass."

222
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:41,199
- He said that?
- Yeah.

223
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,264
And you think it's funny?

224
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,307
It's in bad taste?

225
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,088
The fuck?

226
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:14,365
That's not what I want.

227
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:19,109
I want 50 T's, 50 reverse, got that?

228
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:22,639
Guys.

229
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,509
Pick up those ice- cream wrappers.

230
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,757
If I were a carpenter

231
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,126
and you were a douche bag

232
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:36,525
What are you doing?

233
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:39,291
Breaking my balls, what's it look like?

234
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,724
I tell you, this no- show shit is tough.

235
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,759
Deciding what not to wear to work,
what not to put in my lunchbox....

236
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,829
You're breaking my heart.

237
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,806
You should try sitting here 10:30 to 3:00.

238
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,239
You got Carson Avenue?

239
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,211
You know that girl the other night?
Danielle?

240
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:01,616
She's a piece of ass, but fucking rude.

241
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,711
It's all here?

242
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,221
You remember to put the spores in there?

243
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,052
That's not funny.

244
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,493
What the fuck's all that?

245
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:14,962
Fiber- optic cable.
High- speed Internet access.

246
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,993
Lot of money in this shit.

247
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:29,006
The kid was supposed to get a job
this summer, an internship.

248
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,481
Then it wasn't right
for what she was studying. Okay.

249
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,074
That's one down.

250
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:37,245
Then she was gonna be a hostess
at Artie Bucco's restaurant. I got her that.

251
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,220
Then she couldn't work
Tuesdays and Thursdays...

252
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:44,092
'cause of her baby- sitting commitment,
and Artie didn't try to understand...

253
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,323
so she left.

254
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,855
Then the baby- sitting family
disappeared to Nantucket.

255
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,437
Then something else fell through,
and then....

256
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,796
So, she's regressing.

257
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:57,273
She keeps it up, she'll be back in the womb.

258
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,435
Over the course of a child's life...

259
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:02,571
there's a constant moving away
and coming back.

260
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,250
Security versus freedom.

261
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:09,212
But what I find interesting,
and that's if I hear you right...

262
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,347
is that at the age of 19...

263
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,653
she actually wants to stay close to home.

264
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,393
See, that's what I was gonna say.

265
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:20,731
- She did have someone close die.
- Jackie.

266
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:25,064
But she brings that up whenever you ask
her to clean up after herself, or whatever.

267
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,037
That she's traumatized.

268
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,903
He was shot to death.

269
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,501
It's tragic, that kid.

270
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,942
It was some kind of drug deal, you said.

271
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,447
Exactly, all the earmarks.

272
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,580
It's gotta be tough.

273
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,423
Then again, they'd been broken up,
and he wasn't very nice to her.

274
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,727
It may be a manipulation, in part.

275
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,098
She's got a hard- on about Columbia.
"It's so competitive."

276
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:01,965
But it doesn't mean
that her pain over Jackie's death isn't real.

277
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,770
Has she said to you or Carmela
she's depressed?

278
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,543
Come on with that shit.
She's gonna be all right.

279
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,751
Maybe she should be on medication.

280
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:20,158
And her anger is focused on Carmela,
not on you?

281
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,288
I catch some shit.

282
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:28,689
But me and Mead' were always close.
Even in that 15- year- old period, you know?

283
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:32,295
When she could hardly stomach Carmela?

284
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:35,964
You are the dad.

285
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,534
The template for all future lovers.

286
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,514
She loves me. I know that.

287
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,478
Since she was a tiny baby.

288
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,316
Might be helpful if she saw someone.

289
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,855
Dr. Wendi Kobler.

290
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:02,433
She's an adolescent psychologist
and an educational consultant.

291
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:03,627
What do you mean?

292
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:07,263
Talk about private family stuff,
like I do here, with you?

293
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:08,962
Yes.

294
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:12,576
Like you said, she's going back to school...

295
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:15,904
she's gonna be with her college pals,
back to the grindstone.

296
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,778
That's all good shit.

297
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:34,064
I thought you had final registration today.

298
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:39,430
Technically, drop- and- add goes on
for the next three weeks.

299
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:43,301
Still, shouldn't you register
for the classes you know you want...

300
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,240
so you don't lose them?

301
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,037
Look...

302
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:50,907
- I decided to take a year off.
- You what?

303
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,485
And do what, loaf around the house?

304
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:58,284
Actually, I'm going to Europe with Misty.

305
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:01,082
What are you talking about?

306
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,691
Look, Mom, I'm just not ready.

307
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,099
If I go back now,
I'll have to start meeting with advisors...

308
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,794
who'll at least want me
to temporarily declare a major...

309
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,734
or independent course of study.

310
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,931
I'll have that to deal with.

311
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:18,142
And obviously
you don't want me around here.

312
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,612
That is not what I said at all.

313
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,985
You think I don't want you here?

314
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:34,854
She knows what I fucking make.
Who am l? Bill Gates?

315
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,286
I already support the kids.

316
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:41,059
You're a bartender. You're supposed to be
listening to my problems.

317
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:44,798
Sorry I'm late.

318
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:47,671
- What's up?
- You tell me.

319
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:51,564
Got a call from Jack Massarone.
Massarone Construction?

320
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,038
A very angry call.

321
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,306
The M80 in the porta- pot. I told Benny--

322
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,473
Don't fuck with me on this.

323
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,853
- The fiber- optic shit.
- You knew it would be boosted?

324
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:06,516
No. Yeah.
I mean, Patsy mentioned something--

325
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:09,287
Jesus Christ, if I wanted Patsy in charge....

326
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:12,586
Use your fucking head, Christopher.

327
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,993
I'm sorry, T, I thought I was.

328
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:18,696
By drawing heat to a $250 million job?

329
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:23,105
Think. The big fucking picture.

330
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,176
Aren't they insured?

331
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,088
She's nice, Janice, you know?

332
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:41,922
- Not my usual type, but....
- Her hair, it's pretty.

333
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:45,619
Pre- Raphaelite, they call it. With the curls.

334
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,530
Nothing but net, motherfucker.

335
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:58,269
She does have an earthy quality,
you got to give her that.

336
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:00,140
It's those big tits.

337
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,079
No disrespect.

338
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,540
And, of course,
there's the issue of her family.

339
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:10,281
Making her happy wouldn't be
the worst thing in the world for my career.

340
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,647
Game.

341
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:18,193
Where you going?

342
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,223
Come on. I'm tired.

343
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,927
Come on. One more.

344
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,414
Come on, a little fucking defense.

345
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,082
Hook shot.

346
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,525
Thank God.

347
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,929
Where is the number
of the therapist Melfi gave you?

348
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,524
Why? What happened?

349
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,803
She's going to Europe, your daughter.

350
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:02,567
She's dropping out of school,
going all over the place on a Eurail Pass.

351
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,768
- What is she, fucking kidding?
- Apparently not.

352
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:07,744
Her passport from our Christmas
in the Bahamas is still valid.

353
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:09,940
- Where is she?
- I don't know. Down the shore.

354
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,880
I suppose all these parties she goes to...

355
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,975
they're all memorials for Jackie Junior,
right?

356
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:15,815
Please, with the yelling.

357
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:19,118
- You still on- line?
- As a matter of fact, I am!

358
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,889
What the fuck's in Europe?

359
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:28,898
Experience.

360
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,367
Real life. Art.

361
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:34,495
I knew all this constant harping on art
was gonna cause trouble.

362
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:36,268
Gonna work in publicity or something.

363
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:39,640
Some friend of Misty's
is making a movie in Denmark.

364
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,873
I think we should call that therapist.

365
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:47,044
She's going back to school.
They got counselors there.

366
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:49,416
Better ones, Ivy League ones.

367
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:53,616
No fucking way she's going to Europe.

368
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:55,617
Fine.

369
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,855
Maybe they don't have to talk.

370
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:02,293
Maybe they're the kind of couple
that doesn't have to talk constantly.

371
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,269
One beer left?

372
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,829
Danielle was over. We had pizza.

373
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:13,803
I figured out what's wrong with that broad,
and it's some bad shit.

374
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:20,749
What's the matter, baby? Tony again?

375
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:27,656
I owe this guy a lot,
but he's a fucking jerk sometimes.

376
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,657
Like he never heard of a learning curve.

377
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:35,032
You know what?

378
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:37,726
I'm gonna get high.

379
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:45,303
I thought you were gonna stop using junk
'cause of your new job.

380
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,307
I am.

381
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:54,577
This is my goodbye party with heroin.

382
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,381
You want to do a hit?

383
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:00,753
I don't know. I did some blow at the club.

384
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:04,422
It's funny with Tony.

385
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:08,262
It's like Danielle was saying,
how we send food to the poorer countries.

386
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,233
No good deed goes unpunished.

387
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,236
What is it with you and this girl?

388
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:15,967
- What? I can't have friends?
- You're amazing, you know that?

389
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:19,902
With all your intelligence,
you never see the big picture.

390
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:23,680
- You met her where?
- At the mall. So?

391
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:25,647
Think, Adriana.

392
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,981
Girl like that. Ass like that.

393
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,853
She don't have a boyfriend,
she don't like Paulie.

394
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,414
- Like he's Jude Law.
- Whatever.

395
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:38,920
Are you that fucking blind?

396
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,634
She's a dyke.

397
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:54,204
You think?

398
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:04,482
Use your head. It's a $250 million job.

399
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:09,116
- My head? It was your idea.
- Excuse me?

400
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:13,395
When the kid there, Vito,
told you how expensive the shit was...

401
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:17,627
I don't know, you gave me a look.

402
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:19,092
A look?

403
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:22,033
So now you're a fucking mind reader?

404
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:23,972
It won't happen again.

405
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:30,206
Stop now, it'll be that much harder
to get back on track.

406
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:32,015
Your mother's right.

407
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:35,348
Just out of curiosity,
what are you planning on using for money?

408
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,479
Cheap Tickets is running a sale.

409
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:41,286
I can cash in the bonds Nana gave me,
and most likely I'll be working.

410
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,088
Some student film.

411
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:47,493
It's not a student film.
It's a feature on DVCAM.

412
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,899
Alvar hangs out with Dogme.
He got honorable mention...

413
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:53,699
at the Winnipeg Film Festival last year,
for his short.

414
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:56,036
Forget money. What about security?

415
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:59,076
You think traipsing around Europe's
a smart move these days?

416
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,772
Like Europe's any less safe than here?

417
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,478
Look, you don't seem to get it.

418
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:08,380
I keep having images of Jackie Aprile
lying in a pool of his own blood...

419
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:10,182
in some street somewhere.

420
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:15,522
So what?
French discos drive away all sad thoughts?

421
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:19,821
What, Mom, you've never heard
of the restorative nature of travel?

422
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,525
Read Henry James.

423
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:25,667
Why does every college have junior year
abroad if there isn't a need for it?

424
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:28,763
Then why don't you wait for junior year?
It's eight months.

425
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,205
'Cause I need it now.

426
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,300
You want to go to Europe? Go.

427
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:34,672
Clear your head. Run with the bulls.

428
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:36,907
Do whatever it is the hell they do over there.

429
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:38,642
Thank you. I will.

430
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,951
Don't you think
she should talk to someone first?

431
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,248
A counselor, maybe?

432
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:45,881
Maybe the college of hard knocks
is what she needs.

433
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:48,551
Let's see how she likes it
when a gypsy lifts her wallet.

434
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,617
Or learn you can't work without a permit...

435
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:53,630
which the French hang on to like their balls.

436
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:01,897
Thank you for that united front.

437
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:04,874
The more we object, the more
she'll want to go. You know her.

438
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:08,003
She's going. I don't understand you,
with this flip- flop.

439
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,239
She'll meet other boys.

440
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:13,250
Maybe an Italian boy, an actual Italian one.
Jackie'll stop playing a big part--

441
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:16,583
- You would want her married to a foreigner?
- Married, no! Jesus!

442
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:20,887
Although, look at Furio.
What's so bad about him?

443
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:23,526
You do what you want...

444
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,723
but I am not gonna stand idle
while she throws her education away.

445
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:27,856
What are you gonna do?

446
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:31,390
She's not gonna take this drastic step
without talking to someone first.

447
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:32,493
Come on.

448
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,061
Dr. Melfi's person
is an educational consultant.

449
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,768
Maybe she can explain to her
how dropping out now...

450
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:40,504
is not going to look at all good
to medical schools.

451
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:42,546
We could use an ally here...

452
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:47,347
some adult, besides us, to toe the line
for accountability and responsibility.

453
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:57,385
So maybe you go on an anti- depressant
to tide you over.

454
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:00,020
You're not paying for it.

455
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:02,995
I don't know. Maybe.

456
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,636
Anyway, it was supposed to be his funeral.

457
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:14,200
Jack's?

458
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,780
And they all stood around...

459
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:19,516
drinking and blubbering...

460
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:23,384
at these egregious,
saccharine, fucking Italian ballads.

461
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,384
It was revolting.

462
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:30,693
After I left the restaurant, I actually vomited.

463
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:34,323
- You were drinking.
- Smoked a joint with my friends, too.

464
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,497
That's okay.

465
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:40,834
As long as you didn't deliberately purge.

466
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:47,168
When I asked you earlier
what Dad does for a living...

467
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,444
you said:

468
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:54,281
"Waste management, wink, wink."
What does "wink, wink" mean?

469
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:57,714
Okay.

470
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:00,547
He's like....

471
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,153
You know?

472
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,166
You mentioned Jack's father
was in the mafia.

473
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,634
I didn't realize your dad was, too.

474
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:17,968
There's no such thing as the mafia.

475
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:20,974
I said Jackie's dad was a loan shark.

476
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:32,254
How did Dad react
when he heard Jack had been killed?

477
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:36,250
He was pretty upset.

478
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:41,158
He used to tell Jackie all the time,
"Don't get involved. Stay in school."

479
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,065
"Get involved"?

480
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:46,865
With what?

481
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:52,365
Drugs.

482
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:55,835
Right.

483
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:57,870
The "X"?

484
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,955
So, Dad was a positive force in Jack's life.

485
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:06,512
Jackie.

486
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:11,183
Yeah.

487
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:15,760
You don't like talking much
about Dad, do you?

488
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,594
He doesn't bother me.

489
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:26,002
I'm gonna ask you a question about Dad.

490
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:32,474
This may be very painful for you.

491
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:38,122
Did Dad ever molest you?

492
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:43,589
- No.
- I don't tell them what we discuss.

493
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:50,691
I don't think so.

494
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,467
- What about Mom?
- God, no!

495
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,799
Unless you consider obsessing about my
fucking GPA an assault, which I do.

496
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:03,608
She has to learn
that education is a lifelong process.

497
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,281
That's what I told them.

498
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:10,049
A college degree is a nice thing, sure,
but not at the sake of emotional well- being.

499
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,049
That's exactly what I said.

500
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:16,791
Perhaps they should examine
their own needs to have you stay in school.

501
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,963
Blow off their self- esteem issues.

502
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:25,333
So, you book on Columbia,
you can come back when you're ready.

503
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:29,169
Or I could write you a letter
to the University of Barcelona.

504
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:32,236
It's a hot school.

505
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:34,636
I'm on a consultancy there.

506
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:54,055
- Busy out there?
- Bachelor party.

507
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,226
Some asshole just slipped on a lime wedge.

508
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:05,203
I was talking to Patsy.

509
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:10,080
Sounds like Chrissy's
got a little Napoleon thing going on.

510
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:12,041
Yeah?

511
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:15,177
- Good.
- Right.

512
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:19,251
Of course. Nobody's denying
his leadership abilities.

513
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:23,956
So, what's the problem?

514
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:27,925
It's just....I don't know.

515
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:31,165
Patsy feels bad, maybe he was passed over.

516
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:33,928
What the fuck do you care?

517
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:36,599
Last year, you were pushing me
to take him out.

518
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,737
I'm just saying,
with the change of rank and all...

519
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:41,436
maybe he feels...

520
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:44,114
marginalized.

521
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:46,940
Marginalized?

522
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:50,517
What the fuck does that even mean?

523
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:09,329
I like your pants. Leather?

524
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:12,336
Yeah. I got them at Bebe.

525
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,377
Fucking packed tonight!

526
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,939
Let's celebrate.

527
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:27,620
No, thanks.
I'm gonna stick with the champagne.

528
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:30,991
It's primo shit, Danny.
We got an awesome connection.

529
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:32,589
It's okay.

530
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,461
So, I was thinking, right?

531
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:44,106
What we do is start our own group.

532
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:46,507
I'll be the singer,
and you two can back me up.

533
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:47,601
- Please.
- Right.

534
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:49,976
What? It's so hard to rap?

535
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:53,778
My bitch, my ho, my ho
My bitch, my bitch, bitch

536
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,842
- What? It's a joke?
- Stop!

537
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,286
- You don't wanna back me up?
- Stop!

538
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:01,780
God.

539
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,921
- That's gorgeous.
- Isn't it?

540
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:10,459
- Christopher gave it to me.
- You like it, baby?

541
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,620
- What are you doing?
- What?

542
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:31,646
I'm gonna go.

543
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:33,815
What? Hang out. What's the matter?

544
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:36,890
I'll call you tomorrow.

545
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,762
You piece of fucking shit!

546
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,795
- What the fuck?
- I saw what you did. What'd you think?

547
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,397
You were gonna fuck the two of us?
You and those fucking videos!

548
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:50,565
She came onto me!

549
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:53,041
She took my hand,
she was rubbing it on herself.

550
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,670
- Bullshit!
- How about right before you came over?

551
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:57,680
She was telling me
where she buys her pants.

552
00:36:57,748 --> 00:37:01,013
Her fucking underwear and shit.
Fucking Bebe's, like I give a fuck.

553
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:04,111
- I thought you said she was gay.
- Who knows what her problem is?

554
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:06,247
Broad like her will fuck a snake.

555
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,119
Use your head.

556
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:10,824
What do I want with that skank,
when I got you?

557
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,726
You were saying she had a nice ass.

558
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:16,263
I was trying to say something positive,
'cause she's your friend.

559
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:20,932
Come here.

560
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,402
What have I been telling you
about this pucchiachia?

561
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,508
She's trying to fuck us up, Adriana.

562
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:38,583
And what we have
is stronger than any of that shit.

563
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:49,029
I'm sorry.

564
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:53,931
Son of a fucking bitch.

565
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,372
What happened to the Krazy Glue?

566
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:04,907
Somebody left the top off. Dried out.

567
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,644
- What'd you want?
- Nothing, really.

568
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:13,281
You should see the floor tiles, though...

569
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,655
that got delivered to the job site.

570
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:19,757
- Mexican travertine.
- Johnny Sposato will take that shit.

571
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:23,359
No more dipping at the job,
according to fucking Alfalfa.

572
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,202
But the order comes down from Tony.

573
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:34,604
- Go ahead.
- What?

574
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,011
Knock off the tile?

575
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:40,944
- Tony says no.
- I got your back.

576
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:43,914
Tony will be fine with it.

577
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:17,550
The rotor on the washing machine broke.
Carm said I could use yours.

578
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:21,316
Clean out the filter this time. Disgusting.

579
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:34,937
So, how's your love life?

580
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:38,706
Why don't you mind
your goddamn business?

581
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:40,573
It feels like it is my business...

582
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:44,671
considering I had to haul your last
boyfriend out of your kitchen in a Hefty bag.

583
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:46,842
You're a miserable fuck, you know that?

584
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:50,243
- You're just like Ma.
- Oh, yeah?

585
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:51,310
Really.

586
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,017
With your condescension
and your sabotage.

587
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:56,992
For your information, Ralph is a great guy.

588
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,723
Trust me, I got more information
than I need about him.

589
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:01,264
It's always something.

590
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:04,096
Are you threatened by the fact
that he has a sense of style?

591
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:06,830
- A sense of style?
- Ralph Lauren, Collegiate?

592
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:10,304
Let me ask you a question.
Do I know this guy better than you?

593
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,467
'Cause I'm telling you he's no fucking good.

594
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:15,774
My happiness
really drives you crazy, doesn't it?

595
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:27,215
This reorganization of the Bureau
could be good for both of us.

596
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,297
- Lilac Personal Shopping.
- Five fucking messages, Danielle?

597
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,002
Can't you take a hint?

598
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:42,538
Stop fucking calling here.

599
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:46,167
- Sweetie, don't be like that.
- "Sweetie," bullshit.

600
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:49,672
- You're lucky I don't rip your ass.
- I thought we were friends.

601
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:52,807
Did you take his hand off your leg?
Did you?

602
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,713
- I tried.
- Bullshit!

603
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,444
Don't ever fucking call me anymore.

604
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,324
Four fucking months of work.

605
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,731
Maybe if we let her cool off.

606
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,457
She thinks I tried to seduce
her fiancé, Dwight.

607
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:14,231
- Little shitbag that he is.
- What now?

608
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:16,964
Do we set someone else up?

609
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:19,740
And waste another five months
getting in close?

610
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,835
Her guard will be up anyway.

611
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:26,144
I think we should consider
the undercover- op a dead issue.

612
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:28,777
Let's just bring her in, straight up.

613
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,957
Still, in all, good work, Ciccerone.

614
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:36,953
Right. Thanks.

615
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:44,525
You know what the problem is, right?

616
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,332
She gave Moltisanti a hard- on.

617
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:51,267
So, what do we do? Hire only schifosas?

618
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:55,844
You know, I had a dream about her
the other night.

619
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,071
This boring cocksucker.

620
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,705
Jehovah's Witnesses are more interesting.

621
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:32,271
Jack! How's your balls?
What are you doing here?

622
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:34,783
I got a foursome with some city engineers.

623
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:36,943
- You got a sec?
- Sure.

624
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,018
Artie Bucco, Jack Massarone.

625
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:41,284
Sure, you been in my restaurant.

626
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:44,086
- Problem with the stracciatelle, right?
- Yeah.

627
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:46,459
Come on.

628
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:52,496
It's all right.

629
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,767
Listen, I don't mean to be a pest,
but some of your guys--

630
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,967
- I told you I'd take care of that.
- This is not the fiber- optics.

631
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:00,977
I'm talking about the floor tiles.

632
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:05,882
- What floor tiles?
- Last night, somebody hijacked a trailer.

633
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,610
The truck crushed a shed
on its way out, too.

634
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:21,955
My mother's expecting us.

635
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:28,104
Look what the cat dragged in.

636
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,630
Fucking greedy cocksucker!

637
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:34,109
You had to come back for more?
Fucking floor tiles, now!

638
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:36,544
- You little fucking prick!
- Come on.

639
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:40,441
- Relax, fellas!
- Mind your own fucking business.

640
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:41,779
What'd I say?

641
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:45,049
I distinctly told you
to lay off this fucking job!

642
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:48,215
Talk to Silvio!
He gave the order, you stupid fuck!

643
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,590
What'd you call me?

644
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,024
That's right.

645
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:56,157
Little fucking tough guy? You bastard.

646
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,900
You work for me, not fucking Silvio.
I told you to knock it off.

647
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:03,829
- I'm calling the police.
- Don't think I forgot...

648
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:06,467
about you going through
my fiancée’s underwear drawer.

649
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:09,478
- That wasn't me, you fucking jerk.
- We'll see.

650
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:16,909
Who the fuck are you?

651
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:18,851
Ralph Bunche, over here?

652
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:21,481
You motherfucker!

653
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:22,820
Oh, my God.

654
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:26,457
- Let me go!
- Let's just get outta here.

655
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,829
Get him to the fucking hospital.
Make sure he keeps his mouth shut.

656
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,101
Keep your fucking mouth shut!

657
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:32,125
Keep your fucking mouth shut!

658
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:35,303
Right, he's the one.

659
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,238
I never said they shouldn't get engaged.

660
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:41,299
Mom?

661
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,379
Can I have a tuna san?

662
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:54,622
- Hang up that phone, please.
- Excuse me?

663
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:00,091
Can I call you back?

664
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:07,464
- Did you go to see Dr. Kobler?
- Yeah.

665
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,666
What did you talk about?

666
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:13,733
She said I don't have to tell you or Dad.
It's confidential.

667
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:16,039
This is what we pay $200 for?

668
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:20,306
It was your idea.
I only saw her out of a gesture of goodwill.

669
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:24,246
I don't know what you're so upset about.

670
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:26,949
It's my right to go to Europe.
That's what she said.

671
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:30,024
I don't care what she said.
She's totally irresponsible.

672
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:35,256
What?

673
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:39,235
The therapist told her
it is her right to go to Europe.

674
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:45,403
She actually thinks this is a good idea?

675
00:45:57,154 --> 00:46:00,954
She said it's no big deal. I can pick
up my education wherever, whenever.

676
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:02,082
Really?

677
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:05,560
Wendi said she can get me into school
in Barcelona if I decide to stay.

678
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:07,995
- Who's Wendi?
- Dr. Wendi Kobler.

679
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:09,054
Barcelona.

680
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:12,368
I could take Melfi's head
and crush it like a fucking walnut.

681
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,801
I feel battered.

682
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,171
I've gotta get to the salon.

683
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:19,602
Did you tell Wendi
that you didn't work all summer?

684
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:23,140
Wait, you're right.

685
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:26,910
I forgot to mention the pivotal role
of the work ethic in this family.

686
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:30,181
- You can lose that smart mouth right now.
- Or what?

687
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:31,979
What is this, Afghanistan?

688
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:35,885
I'm over 18 now, I'm a grown woman.
I can go where I want and do what I want.

689
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:39,622
All right, Jesus, God, we know that!
Is that your only point here?

690
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:43,361
Because just getting what you want
is for babies, not adults.

691
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:52,166
It may interest you to know
she thinks I should probably be on Prozac.

692
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:53,869
- She does?
- She said that?

693
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:56,105
Jackie was murdered. I know you think...

694
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:59,775
it's nothing screaming my head off
at the Columbia- Army game wouldn't cure.

695
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:02,375
- That is so unfair.
- All right, look.

696
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:04,313
I've been thinking about this.

697
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:08,822
Now, you're a smart girl.
The right move for you is to wait.

698
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:11,786
Just till next year, maybe.

699
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:13,989
You know what I don't understand, Dad?

700
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:17,730
- You were all in favor of me going.
- Your mother doesn't want it.

701
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:19,958
Wow.

702
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:22,463
Listen to Mr. Mob Boss.

703
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,200
What did you call me?

704
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:27,471
All this fucking pussyfooting around.
Years now?

705
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,306
- Why don't we just get it all out there?
- Shut up.

706
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,843
You got something you wanna say to me?

707
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:37,784
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

708
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,619
What do you mean? All these innuendoes.

709
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:44,058
You inferring
I didn't do everything I could...

710
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,527
to keep that kid from fucking himself up?

711
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:50,464
That, knowing him and his family...

712
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,526
that I didn't try to be a better dad to him
than his own dad?

713
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:57,131
God rest his soul.
That I didn't try to protect Jackie Junior?

714
00:47:57,207 --> 00:48:00,005
That I didn't smack him around,
'cause I was so frustrated?

715
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:02,238
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

716
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,439
I'm through telling people
you help with environmental cleanup.

717
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:08,916
That's not what I asked you.

718
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:11,716
Like you could talk honestly
for three fucking seconds.

719
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:13,153
You try me!

720
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:24,929
I've made my plans, I'm going to Europe,
and I'm getting the fuck out of here!

721
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:26,993
- You been told no!
- Watch me!

722
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,005
Don't do it! I'm warning you, do not do it!

723
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:41,682
Do it for Mommy.

724
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,451
That's a good girl.

725
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:57,797
Special agent Dwight Harris, FBI.

726
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:00,594
I believe you two have already met.

727
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:02,836
Holy fucking shit!

728
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:05,534
Don't make a scene.
You don't want to attract attention.

729
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:08,271
- You're in the fucking FBI?
- We need to talk, Ade.

730
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:11,906
It'll only take a half hour,
and I assure you, it's in your best interest.

731
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:13,779
Come with us, please.

732
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:15,681
- My dog.
- It's okay.

733
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:17,811
Just take her with you.

734
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,359
Am I under arrest?

735
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:33,433
Not at this time,
but that can all change momentarily.

736
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:39,232
That's a search warrant.
Your office, your club, your cocaine.

737
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:41,904
- It's not my cocaine.
- Really?

738
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:45,307
- That's not what I have you saying on tape.
- You were taping me?

739
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:48,943
If I were you, I'd put aside
my hurt feelings for a while.

740
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:58,518
I told you shit in confidence
that had nothing to do with any of this shit!

741
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:00,858
Things that I never told no one.

742
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,432
We're offering you a way out.

743
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:06,058
A chance to save your life
and Christopher's life.

744
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:08,399
You don't give a fuck about us!

745
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:10,963
You and your fucking ob- gyn doctor.

746
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:12,774
You wanted me and Christopher...

747
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:15,812
to stay together long enough
so you could find shit out.

748
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:28,182
We understand your fiancé
is moving up in the world...

749
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:29,758
or down, as the case may be.

750
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:32,351
Problems at the Esplanade
construction site?

751
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:33,453
Oh, my God.

752
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:38,496
We're not asking you to wear a wire.
We're not asking you to testify.

753
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:40,769
We just want information.

754
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:44,999
Is your name even Danielle?

755
00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:58,320
What if I say no?

756
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:01,016
If you say no,
you'll be placed under arrest...

757
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:04,185
and charged with possession
and intent to distribute cocaine...

758
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:09,025
a charge that carries with it
a penalty of up to 25 years in prison.

759
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:10,324
Oh, my God.

760
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,891
After you make bail,
you can explain to Tony Soprano...

761
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:16,803
why you brought an undercover federal
agent into his home during Sunday dinner.

762
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:19,637
- My God.
- We'll probably never hear about it though.

763
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:23,236
Chances are you and Christopher
will just disappear.

764
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:29,448
Get the wastebasket.

765
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:48,460
Come on.

766
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:54,806
I left three messages. Are you okay?

767
00:51:57,147 --> 00:51:58,512
You look like shit.

768
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:03,452
I didn't sleep too good.

769
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:05,313
It's Meadow.

770
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:08,817
I don't know.
We think maybe she ran off to Europe.

771
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:10,949
Europe?

772
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:17,559
- So, you got a minute?
- Who's that?

773
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:19,830
Nobody, go back to sleep.

774
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:24,238
How you doing, hon?

775
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:38,281
This floor tile shit...

776
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:40,019
misunderstanding.

777
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,595
It's a huge job.

778
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:49,087
A lot of money at stake.

779
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,831
You of all people should know that.

780
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:53,827
What? Are you mad at me now?

781
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:59,664
You're getting to be a very strange man
in your old age, you know that?

782
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:00,835
What?

783
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:02,907
I'm just asking.

784
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,244
Is it a hanging offense, or not?

785
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:10,887
Did you deliberately disobey me?

786
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:12,247
Of course not.

787
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,415
'Cause Patsy says you gave the okay.

788
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,321
This is after Chrissy talked to him.

789
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:20,954
Timeline got fucked up.

790
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:25,960
- We go back a long way.
- Indeed we do.

791
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:28,462
If in any way you feel like...

792
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:33,008
Chrissy usurped you or anything like that,
and you're trying to read me....

793
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:38,609
- That's not how it is.
- Fine.

794
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:43,553
Whole thing, misunderstanding.

795
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:52,795
Truckload of floor tiles.

796
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:57,192
You should be looking at what, $30, 000?

797
00:54:00,337 --> 00:54:04,034
Should be about $2, 000 there.
I'll have the rest for you later.

798
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,566
I know you will.

799
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:23,355
What? You catch some shrapnel?

800
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:29,829
"Intro to Social Theory" is....

801
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:32,301
Sorry, it's closed out.

802
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:37,668
You're cutting it a little close
for most of the popular classes.

803
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:51,477
- What about this one?
- 09531?

804
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:56,654
It's your lucky day.

805
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,071
I've been thinking, and if you want...

806
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,975
we can talk to your cousin Brian
about the estate planning.

807
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:26,912
Listen to him, now.
What? Do you feel guilty?

808
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:30,226
You have nothing to feel guilty about.

809
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:32,923
It's me she blames.

810
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:36,462
What for?
