1
00:00:02,613 --> 00:00:04,843
Isn't college cool?

2
00:00:05,653 --> 00:00:09,487
I just haven't had a lot of time
to think about life at UC Sunnydale.

3
00:00:09,573 --> 00:00:12,326
- Wow.
- Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

4
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:14,483
- Have you met your roommate yet?
- No.

5
00:00:14,773 --> 00:00:17,970
- Hi.
- Hi. It's nice to meet you.

6
00:00:18,053 --> 00:00:21,568
Kathy. I just know that this
whole year is gonna be super fun.

7
00:00:23,973 --> 00:00:28,489
I've forgotten my manners in the concussion.
I'm Riley. Are you taking Intro Psych?

8
00:00:28,573 --> 00:00:31,167
- You've taken it?
- I'm a TA. I help the professor.

9
00:00:31,253 --> 00:00:32,652
I'm Professor Walsh.

10
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:36,089
Those who fall under my good graces
will come to know me as Maggie.

11
00:00:36,173 --> 00:00:40,530
Those who don't will come to know me by
the name my TAs use and think I don't know:

12
00:00:40,613 --> 00:00:42,604
the Evil Bitch Monster of Death.

13
00:00:42,693 --> 00:00:46,652
Officially, you no longer have a watcher.
I'll always be here when you need me.

14
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:48,166
You'll have to take care of yourself.

15
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,647
So, college not so scary after all, huh?

16
00:00:56,373 --> 00:01:00,446
It's turning out to be a lot like high school,
which I can handle.

17
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:02,649
At least I know what to expect.

18
00:01:11,253 --> 00:01:13,483
Wow, this music is so,

19
00:01:13,853 --> 00:01:17,562
- so...
- I know. This song is super fun, isn't it?

20
00:01:17,813 --> 00:01:22,011
You bet. It just gets funner
and funner every time you play it.

21
00:01:23,853 --> 00:01:26,447
- Going out?
- Yeah.

22
00:01:27,453 --> 00:01:29,603
I'm seriously caffeine deprived.

23
00:01:29,693 --> 00:01:32,526
Figured I'd head down
to The Grotto and get a jolt and

24
00:01:32,613 --> 00:01:36,447
- do some studying.
- It's late. Won't you be up all night?

25
00:01:36,853 --> 00:01:38,969
Oh, yeah, but it's cool.

26
00:01:39,053 --> 00:01:42,568
I'm sort of an up kinda night person.

27
00:01:44,093 --> 00:01:45,287
I mentioned that, right?

28
00:01:45,373 --> 00:01:50,049
I guess I didn't realise you'd be coming
and going at all hours. Well, not that I mind.

29
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:54,126
- I'm just surprised.
- I'll be quiet as a mouse, I promise.

30
00:01:55,453 --> 00:01:57,921
- OK.
- Say, Buffy.

31
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:02,284
I wanted to show you
this little system I implemented.

32
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:04,966
Oh, goody. System.

33
00:02:05,053 --> 00:02:09,569
Just log every call you make in here
so when the bill comes it won't be a problem.

34
00:02:09,653 --> 00:02:13,168
- Cos I figure "A stitch in time...
- ..catches the worm."

35
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:17,331
You bet. OK, then.

36
00:02:18,853 --> 00:02:20,844
Also...

37
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:24,164
I noticed that some of my milk was missing.
Did you...?

38
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:29,204
- Yeah, actually, I did. I meant to...
- No. It's totally OK. I was just wondering.

39
00:02:29,293 --> 00:02:33,002
- Yeah, I was making my coffee and...
- It's fine. I just wanted to make sure

40
00:02:40,213 --> 00:02:42,773
that we didn't have a thief or something.

41
00:02:42,853 --> 00:02:45,413
Like who? Sid the Wiley Dairy Gnome?

42
00:02:46,373 --> 00:02:49,445
I don't know... It's no big deal.
I mean, please, feel free.

43
00:02:49,613 --> 00:02:52,366
OK. I'm really sorry.

44
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:56,252
- I have to...
- Have a good time.

45
00:02:57,453 --> 00:02:59,444
Yeah. You, too.

46
00:03:00,293 --> 00:03:02,284
With ironing.

47
00:03:12,253 --> 00:03:14,687
So you had trouble getting past Kathy?

48
00:03:14,773 --> 00:03:17,367
Yep. She made big with the questions.

49
00:03:18,053 --> 00:03:21,045
You thought your days
of sneaking out of your room were over.

50
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:23,283
No such luck.

51
00:03:23,373 --> 00:03:29,687
Kathy's nice and all, but she's, sort of,
I don't know, like, Mini-Mom of Momdonia.

52
00:03:30,493 --> 00:03:32,961
Wait. Did you just hear something?

53
00:03:33,053 --> 00:03:36,125
- I'm chewing my gum kinda loud.
- That's not it.

54
00:03:36,213 --> 00:03:40,206
- My sneakers are squeaky.
- I'm looking for something lurky, Will.

55
00:03:43,853 --> 00:03:47,687
- Sorry, no.
- Darn, I could use a little play tonight.

56
00:03:47,773 --> 00:03:50,685
Listening to the best ofVH1 all day
sorta put me on edge.

57
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:55,449
- Kathy's still spinning the divas?
- Cos it's the funnest.

58
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:58,889
It's no big. College is a time of change, right?

59
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:02,770
Before too long,
she'll be trip-hopping all over the place.

60
00:04:02,853 --> 00:04:07,608
Yeah. This whole dorm thing is just
an adjustment we need to make.

61
00:04:07,693 --> 00:04:11,527
You know? I mean, my roomie
is kind of "challenging", too.

62
00:04:12,213 --> 00:04:14,602
And what are we,
if not women up to a challenge?

63
00:04:14,693 --> 00:04:18,288
Exactly. I mean,
did we not put the "grr" in "girl"?

64
00:04:19,253 --> 00:04:22,609
- Well, here's where I get off.
- Say hey to Oz for me.

65
00:04:22,693 --> 00:04:25,207
- Happy hunting.
- Wish me monsters.

66
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:43,924
Will?

67
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:55,371
All right, why don't you quit hiding
and come out and face me like a thing?

68
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:58,924
Hey, I caught you.

69
00:06:00,053 --> 00:06:02,521
- Is everything OK?
- Everything's super.

70
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:06,003
I just decided a decaf latte
sounded like heaven after all.

71
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:09,969
So you're coming along.

72
00:06:10,493 --> 00:06:14,964
Why not? This way, you don't have
to walk these spooky paths alone.

73
00:06:15,053 --> 00:06:17,044
Great.

74
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:19,244
That's just great.

75
00:06:21,453 --> 00:06:25,366
This is neat, isn't it? The fresh air, the trees.

76
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:27,683
The smell of...

77
00:06:48,613 --> 00:06:50,683
What the blizzard was that all about?

78
00:06:51,373 --> 00:06:54,843
He tried to take my backpack.

79
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:58,369
God, what were you thinking,
taking him on like that?

80
00:06:58,453 --> 00:07:01,843
I don't know. I guess I panicked.

81
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:05,562
I mean, it's just you could've
gotten hurt or something.

82
00:07:05,653 --> 00:07:08,247
God, and look at my sweater, it's ruined.

83
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,044
Yeah, sorry about that.

84
00:07:11,773 --> 00:07:13,968
Here, we'll go get you cleaned up.

85
00:07:35,653 --> 00:07:37,769
Boring. Boring.

86
00:07:37,853 --> 00:07:39,844
Bill. Bill.

87
00:07:42,773 --> 00:07:44,843
Hello.

88
00:07:44,933 --> 00:07:48,926
- You run?
- And jump. And bend.

89
00:07:50,613 --> 00:07:53,332
- And occasionally frolic.
- OK.

90
00:07:53,413 --> 00:07:57,122
And what's with the Motorbike
and Scooter magazine?

91
00:07:57,213 --> 00:08:00,523
Congratulations, you've found me out.
I'm a mod jogger.

92
00:08:00,853 --> 00:08:02,844
Are you having a midlife thing?

93
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:06,289
I still go "ish" from the last time
you tried to recapture your youth.

94
00:08:06,373 --> 00:08:08,364
- Buffy.
- Sorry.

95
00:08:10,013 --> 00:08:13,289
Demon. Last night.
Made with the pummelling, but he got away.

96
00:08:13,373 --> 00:08:16,683
- What sort of demon?
- He had a cloak on

97
00:08:16,773 --> 00:08:21,210
and glowing green eyes. And his skin
had a, like, super-bad fake rub-on tan.

98
00:08:22,453 --> 00:08:24,887
- Translate?
- Orangey.

99
00:08:25,293 --> 00:08:28,205
Thank you. Anything else?

100
00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:32,242
My roommate Kathy was there,
but she didn't see anything.

101
00:08:33,653 --> 00:08:36,121
You took your roommate
patrolling with you?

102
00:08:36,213 --> 00:08:40,809
I invited the whole dorm,
but she was the only one that could make it.

103
00:08:40,893 --> 00:08:44,772
I told her I was going for coffee
and she decided to tag along.

104
00:08:45,013 --> 00:08:48,528
We should discourage her from that habit.
From what you describe,

105
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:53,368
I'm not familiar with the creature, but I'll
give you a ring when I've found something.

106
00:08:53,453 --> 00:08:57,685
- You know, it's nice out here.
- Yes, I take my tea out here sometimes.

107
00:08:57,773 --> 00:09:01,482
- What are you doing today?
- It's a big day for me, actually.

108
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:04,610
A friend acquired an original
Gutenberg demonography.

109
00:09:04,693 --> 00:09:07,685
And you've never once asked me
what my day's plans were,

110
00:09:07,773 --> 00:09:11,288
which leads me to inquire
whether you're feeling yourself.

111
00:09:11,373 --> 00:09:14,365
That's not true. I ask about you all the time.

112
00:09:16,653 --> 00:09:20,885
OK, maybe the words don't actually make it
out of my mouth, but I think about it.

113
00:09:20,973 --> 00:09:22,645
And it's appreciated.

114
00:09:22,733 --> 00:09:26,567
Doesn't explain why you're hanging around
instead of rushing off as usual.

115
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:32,050
It's no big. I just figured I'd hang here,
you know, until

116
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:34,169
my roommate goes to class.

117
00:09:35,813 --> 00:09:37,371
I see.

118
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:41,812
I know, it's probably just me
having a bitch attack. But it's not me.

119
00:09:42,853 --> 00:09:46,209
Living with somebody is never easy.
Especially for an only child.

120
00:09:46,293 --> 00:09:48,853
Giles, listen. When sharpening her pencils,

121
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:52,289
she measures them with a ruler
so they're all the same size.

122
00:09:52,373 --> 00:09:56,366
Which is fussy, I agree,
but everybody has their idiosyncrasies.

123
00:09:56,453 --> 00:09:58,603
You'd do well to learn to tolerate them.

124
00:09:58,693 --> 00:10:01,844
Or I'll end up an old lady
who can only live with cats?

125
00:10:03,213 --> 00:10:07,001
- Something like that.
- OK. You know what? You're right.

126
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:12,926
Take a mental pic. This is the new Buffy.
Kinder, gentler, roommate extraordinaire.

127
00:11:35,173 --> 00:11:37,812
Ex-boyfriend or loan shark?

128
00:11:40,173 --> 00:11:43,245
- Excuse me?
- The person you're hiding from.

129
00:11:45,173 --> 00:11:46,367
Both.

130
00:11:46,453 --> 00:11:48,444
Ugly break-up.

131
00:11:49,013 --> 00:11:53,291
- I'm sorry, I just cut you...
- No, stay, stay. I'll watch your back.

132
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:03,211
- Freshman, huh?
- Is it that obvious?

133
00:12:03,293 --> 00:12:08,970
There are signs. People who've been around
know how to use their dining-hall card.

134
00:12:09,053 --> 00:12:10,532
It's not for food?

135
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:15,607
Work it right and you get three meals' worth,
which equals fewer punch cards used.

136
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,048
More cash from dad
that you keep for yourself.

137
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:23,161
Right. See, the goal is to polish off
as much as humanly possible in one sitting.

138
00:12:23,253 --> 00:12:28,532
Enough to get you through the day, while
chipmunking items for future consumption.

139
00:12:29,813 --> 00:12:30,848
Got it.

140
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:35,370
Excess dry goods
fit nicely in a backpack or your pocket.

141
00:12:35,453 --> 00:12:40,288
The wetter items - macaronis,
your turkey loaf - then you're into Ziplocs.

142
00:12:40,373 --> 00:12:43,365
- It's not for beginners.
- I'll just take it slow.

143
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:56,408
- So...
- So, those are my...

144
00:12:57,653 --> 00:13:00,850
- Are you...?
- Oh, no, I have someone waiting.

145
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:02,764
Otherwise, I'd...

146
00:13:04,373 --> 00:13:06,967
Parker Abrams. I'm at Kresky Hall.

147
00:13:07,773 --> 00:13:10,162
Buffy Summers, Stevenson.

148
00:13:10,493 --> 00:13:15,726
OK. Well, I'll see you around,
Buffy Summers of Stevenson.

149
00:13:16,373 --> 00:13:18,762
See ya, Parker Abrams.

150
00:13:25,293 --> 00:13:28,285
Hey. Say hi to Non-College Guy.

151
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:33,765
Not that I mind, but don't non-college guys
usually populate the non-campus?

152
00:13:33,853 --> 00:13:37,607
Usually. I just thought I'd come around
and check on my girls.

153
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:41,652
- And eat off my plate.
- What's the deal? Parents not feeding you?

154
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:46,682
- Sure they do. For a price.
- So, spill.

155
00:13:46,773 --> 00:13:49,845
What was that all about,
with the cutie patootie?

156
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:54,290
I don't know. Nothing serious, I think.
Just random adorableness.

157
00:13:54,373 --> 00:13:59,367
A technique I know well.
Hit the girl with your best shot, then hasta.

158
00:13:59,453 --> 00:14:03,446
- Gotta respect the drive-by.
- Low rejection, fond memories.

159
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:08,208
It looked like more than that to me.
He got all googly-eyed.

160
00:14:08,293 --> 00:14:11,922
That's because he got hit by the Buffinator.
Now he's powerless.

161
00:14:12,013 --> 00:14:15,369
- You think?
- No question, he'll be back.

162
00:14:16,653 --> 00:14:18,803
So what else is up with the Buff?

163
00:14:18,893 --> 00:14:21,043
- Any vamp action?
- No.

164
00:14:21,133 --> 00:14:24,569
I did get jumped by a demon
of non-specific origin last night.

165
00:14:24,653 --> 00:14:29,408
Yeah? Something apocalypsey?
Do we need to assemble the Scooby gang?

166
00:14:30,693 --> 00:14:32,763
No, but thank you for asking.

167
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,603
I just got way too excited, didn't l?

168
00:14:35,693 --> 00:14:38,127
You need to get out of
the basement a little more.

169
00:14:38,213 --> 00:14:40,204
Hi, everybody.

170
00:14:41,453 --> 00:14:43,205
Squeeze in.

171
00:14:44,493 --> 00:14:46,484
You all know my roomie, Kathy.

172
00:14:46,573 --> 00:14:48,609
- Hi.
- Hey, Kathy.

173
00:14:51,773 --> 00:14:54,207
Is that my sweater?

174
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,807
I didn't think you'd mind.
You got mine all muddy.

175
00:14:56,893 --> 00:14:59,282
- I was saving you from a...
- Bear.

176
00:15:00,173 --> 00:15:02,164
mugger.

177
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:09,332
It's not a problem, is it? I figure we're like
sisters now, living together and everything.

178
00:15:12,933 --> 00:15:15,731
No, it's... it's fine.

179
00:15:16,253 --> 00:15:18,483
I just wished you'd asked.

180
00:15:19,693 --> 00:15:23,447
- So, where're you from, Kathy?
- Nebraska, originally.

181
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:26,093
Ah, yes. Big-sky country.

182
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:37,493
Can you believe her? First she acts
like she has sit privileges at my lunch table

183
00:15:37,493 --> 00:15:40,291
Can you believe her? First she acts
like she has sit privileges at my lunch table

184
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:43,285
just because a computer
decided to make us cellmates.

185
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:48,128
I'm sure it's not easy for her. She's
not like you - she doesn't know anybody here.

186
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,204
Fine. But what about my sweater?

187
00:15:50,293 --> 00:15:52,329
You can't believe what I put up with.

188
00:15:52,413 --> 00:15:54,404
Yeah, I guess it's hard.

189
00:15:55,373 --> 00:15:58,171
- The sweater thing was an accident.
- I don’t know.

190
00:15:58,253 --> 00:16:01,689
- Sorry.
- I don't think I can take another day of this.

191
00:16:01,773 --> 00:16:03,570
She's back from the bathroom. Call you back.

192
00:16:08,453 --> 00:16:10,683
Don't forget to log those calls.

193
00:16:55,893 --> 00:16:57,884
Who left their gum here?

194
00:16:59,413 --> 00:17:02,849
- Gum gnome?
- It wasn't me. It had to be somebody, Buffy.

195
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:05,922
I don't know.

196
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,170
Do you always make that noise
when you sleep?

197
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:46,688
So, after the scorpion, the demon opened my
mouth and sucked a weird light out of me.

198
00:17:46,773 --> 00:17:51,403
And the worst part? I wake up and
there's Kathy, staring at me like I'm a freak.

199
00:17:51,493 --> 00:17:55,850
Actually, the worst part, I'd have to go with
the demon pouring blood down your throat.

200
00:17:55,933 --> 00:17:58,003
Me, too. I would vote for that, too.

201
00:17:58,093 --> 00:18:00,846
But that's just a dream,
and this Kathy thing is real.

202
00:18:00,933 --> 00:18:04,164
All she cared about was
her precious sleep being disturbed.

203
00:18:04,253 --> 00:18:08,804
Perhaps it would be more productive
to examine your dreams.

204
00:18:08,893 --> 00:18:11,771
Determine their meaning.

205
00:18:11,853 --> 00:18:14,367
You can read dreams? Neat.

206
00:18:14,453 --> 00:18:17,126
Giles, Kathy. Kathy, Giles.

207
00:18:17,413 --> 00:18:20,803
He's our grown-up friend.
Not in a creepy way.

208
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:24,203
- Nice to meet you, Kathy.
- Ditto.

209
00:18:24,293 --> 00:18:26,932
Maybe you can read
the dream I had last night?

210
00:18:27,013 --> 00:18:30,608
There was this monster and he sat on me
and did all this stuff to me.

211
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,924
Stuff like scorpions?
And Bloody Mary minus the Mary?

212
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:36,322
- How'd you know?
- Well, I'm a good guesser.

213
00:18:36,413 --> 00:18:40,725
Me, too. And I'm guessing that you need
to be on your way to class. Right, Kath?

214
00:18:41,573 --> 00:18:44,041
Somebody woke up
on the wrong side of the bed.

215
00:18:44,293 --> 00:18:47,091
And guess what? You were next to it.

216
00:18:47,853 --> 00:18:52,529
You know, I need to dash. My whole schedule
is off because someone kept me up all night.

217
00:18:52,613 --> 00:18:54,968
Well, it's been fun. Toddles.

218
00:18:55,053 --> 00:18:57,044
Toddles.

219
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,688
- You know what this means?
- Yes.

220
00:19:02,773 --> 00:19:06,402
Not only does she take my sweater,
but now she has to horn in on my dreams.

221
00:19:06,493 --> 00:19:10,930
She is the most ever mooch.
I haven't even gotten to the floss.

222
00:19:11,013 --> 00:19:16,292
Buffy, focus. Please? lf Kathy and you
are having the same nightmares,

223
00:19:16,373 --> 00:19:19,729
chances are something happened
when you both met the demon.

224
00:19:19,813 --> 00:19:25,046
So we need to figure out if this ritual they're
dreaming about has some use or meaning.

225
00:19:25,453 --> 00:19:27,762
Cool. You guys can do the brain thing.

226
00:19:27,853 --> 00:19:31,482
- I'm gonna go to class.
- Which could also be the brain thing.

227
00:19:31,573 --> 00:19:34,133
Not when you're minoring in Napping 101.

228
00:19:36,533 --> 00:19:41,448
OK, so that was the evil twin, right?
Cos she was bordering on Cordelia-esque.

229
00:19:41,533 --> 00:19:44,764
She's definitely pushing
the stress meter on this Kathy thing.

230
00:19:44,853 --> 00:19:47,526
I concur that she's not herself.

231
00:19:47,613 --> 00:19:51,845
But, you know, learning
to live with someone can be a challenge.

232
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:54,128
And she hasn't been sleeping.

233
00:19:54,453 --> 00:19:58,048
Right, then.
Nothing to get too concerned about.

234
00:19:58,773 --> 00:20:00,843
Still, let me know if she...

235
00:20:01,213 --> 00:20:03,204
Hits the red zone?

236
00:20:04,293 --> 00:20:05,772
Yes.

237
00:20:49,893 --> 00:20:53,283
Lots of popular artists don't get their dues.
Madonna. Whitney.

238
00:20:53,373 --> 00:20:56,206
- That's so totally true.
- Parker?

239
00:20:57,053 --> 00:21:02,844
Hey. I just stopped by
to say that. And bring you...

240
00:21:04,693 --> 00:21:07,890
You know, to maximise
your dining-hall exports.

241
00:21:08,213 --> 00:21:12,365
- They're heavy-duty.
- "Plus freezer guard". That's so...

242
00:21:12,453 --> 00:21:16,412
Parker was just gonna leave his number
and go, but we started talking.

243
00:21:16,813 --> 00:21:19,281
He's such a blast, and the time just flew.

244
00:21:19,893 --> 00:21:22,088
Time? Really? How much time?

245
00:21:23,453 --> 00:21:26,365
I'm not sure. We sort of
got caught up talking Red Wings.

246
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:29,843
It turns out Kathy's a closet hockey fan.
I think it's the violence.

247
00:21:29,933 --> 00:21:33,687
- Quit it. I told you that was just between us.
- It could be the sweaty men.

248
00:21:33,773 --> 00:21:35,445
Stop.

249
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:40,561
Look, if you two are gonna rassle, can you
take it outside? I have a lot of work to do.

250
00:21:41,373 --> 00:21:43,364
Sorry, I didn't realise.

251
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:48,164
Parker, wait.
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

252
00:21:48,253 --> 00:21:50,608
No, it's totally cool. I should go anyway.

253
00:21:50,933 --> 00:21:55,211
Well, it was great of you to stop by.
Maybe we could do it another time?

254
00:21:56,853 --> 00:21:59,083
Another time, for sure.

255
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:02,442
- Bye, Kathy.
- Bye. See ya.

256
00:22:09,693 --> 00:22:12,446
It wouldn't have killed you
to be nice, you know.

257
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:15,605
Looked like you were being
nice enough for the both of us.

258
00:22:15,693 --> 00:22:19,049
I wasn't moving in on your territory,
if that’s what you mean.

259
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:22,125
Right. Just like you didn't
destroy my sweater.

260
00:22:34,173 --> 00:22:37,563
- I'm cold.
- Well, I'm hot. Deal with it.

261
00:22:38,533 --> 00:22:40,888
- D'you know what your problem is, Buffy?
- You?

262
00:22:40,973 --> 00:22:44,363
Hardly. Your problem is you're spoiled.

263
00:22:44,453 --> 00:22:48,526
The world revolved around you where
you used to live, but it's share time now.

264
00:22:48,613 --> 00:22:52,208
Share time, huh? Fine.
I'll show you share time.

265
00:23:13,133 --> 00:23:16,523
- You're worried about her.
- Yeah, both of them.

266
00:23:16,613 --> 00:23:21,926
What kind of demon runs around putting
ooky blood dreams into people's heads?

267
00:23:22,013 --> 00:23:25,449
Like some kind of nightmare fairy.
It's not right.

268
00:23:25,533 --> 00:23:30,527
- Well, I'm against it.
- And Buffy's completely being not herself.

269
00:23:31,013 --> 00:23:34,050
If it wasn't for this English paper,
I'd be there right now.

270
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:37,523
You know, listening.
Doing the girly best friend thing.

271
00:23:39,093 --> 00:23:42,085
- Well, I can do that.
- You can?

272
00:23:42,173 --> 00:23:45,768
I'm not saying we'll braid each other's hair,
but I can hang with her.

273
00:23:45,853 --> 00:23:49,528
- Watch for signs she's going over the edge.
- You're the best.

274
00:23:49,613 --> 00:23:51,729
She's probably patrolling by now.

275
00:23:51,813 --> 00:23:54,122
Check around the science centre.

276
00:23:54,213 --> 00:23:59,162
If you need me, I'll be at the library.

277
00:24:29,613 --> 00:24:34,607
..so then Kathy's like "It's share time."
And I'm like "Oh, yeah? Share this."

278
00:24:36,573 --> 00:24:40,168
So either you hit her,
or you did your wacky mime routine for her.

279
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:44,608
I didn't do either, actually.
But she deserved it, don't you think?

280
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:48,288
- Nobody deserves a mime, Buffy.
- Kathy does.

281
00:24:48,853 --> 00:24:53,973
She deserves to be locked in an invisible box
and blown away by an imaginary wind and...

282
00:24:54,053 --> 00:24:57,648
- Forced to wear a binding unitard?
- The itchy kind. It's perfect.

283
00:24:57,733 --> 00:25:01,282
- I'm just here to help.
- Which I appreciate.

284
00:25:01,373 --> 00:25:06,288
But you've never come on routine patrol
with me before, Oz. So what's the deal?

285
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:09,041
Seemed more interesting than homework.

286
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:13,046
As long as it's an elective.
I can handle myself alone, you know.

287
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:15,488
- Not in question.
- Good.

288
00:25:15,853 --> 00:25:19,368
So, I go to the refrigerator, right?
And the Label Queen has put...

289
00:25:19,453 --> 00:25:24,322
Just a thought - do you think all this
ranting is scaring away potential demons?

290
00:25:25,053 --> 00:25:29,490
You're right.
She's even affecting my work now.

291
00:25:29,573 --> 00:25:33,486
She's the Titanic.
She's a crawling black cancer.

292
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:38,969
She's other really bad things.

293
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:43,406
On the plus side, you killed the bench,
which was looking shifty.

294
00:25:44,053 --> 00:25:47,602
This isn't funny, Oz.
Something has to be done.

295
00:25:50,773 --> 00:25:52,373
Agreed.

296
00:27:08,853 --> 00:27:10,844
I'm going to bed.

297
00:27:41,973 --> 00:27:43,884
Oh, jeez.

298
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,968
I do what I can, but Buffy's difficult.
She's secretive, for one thing.

299
00:27:50,053 --> 00:27:53,966
She comes in at all hours of the night.
She leaves her gum all over the place.

300
00:27:54,053 --> 00:27:58,604
It sounds like things are rough, but don't
you wanna be talking to Buffy about this?

301
00:27:58,693 --> 00:28:02,242
I would, but she's so touchy
about all kinds of weird stuff.

302
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:06,884
I mean, sometimes I get the feeling
that she is not quite normal. You know?

303
00:28:06,973 --> 00:28:09,612
Well, normal is relative, right?

304
00:28:14,813 --> 00:28:16,804
Later, OK?

305
00:28:19,933 --> 00:28:24,051
- Why were you talking to her?
- Buffy, come on. We were just saying hi.

306
00:28:24,133 --> 00:28:26,442
Yeah, that's what she wants you to think.

307
00:28:26,533 --> 00:28:28,683
Buffy, this has to stop.

308
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:33,801
I mean, I get it. I have a sucky roomie, too.
But you just have to deal.

309
00:28:35,053 --> 00:28:39,012
You're right. I've been
thinking a lot about this and

310
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:42,210
- it's clear to me now.
- Good. That's better.

311
00:28:42,293 --> 00:28:45,091
Kathy's evil. I'm an evil fighter.

312
00:28:45,853 --> 00:28:48,447
It's simple. I'm gonna have to kill her.

313
00:28:53,853 --> 00:28:56,048
You have to kill her?

314
00:28:56,133 --> 00:28:59,569
Don't you think you could
just switch rooms or something?

315
00:28:59,653 --> 00:29:02,929
Well, I would, but it's not just me
in danger from Kathy.

316
00:29:03,013 --> 00:29:04,685
Look.

317
00:29:07,013 --> 00:29:09,607
- Toenails?
- Evil toenails.

318
00:29:10,293 --> 00:29:13,842
I took them when she was in the bathroom.
She thought I was asleep.

319
00:29:13,933 --> 00:29:17,403
Cos in the middle of the night
they could have attacked you

320
00:29:17,493 --> 00:29:19,961
and left little marks all over your body.

321
00:29:20,053 --> 00:29:22,408
Don't be ridiculous.

322
00:29:22,493 --> 00:29:26,088
I measured them before I fell asleep
and again this morning,

323
00:29:26,173 --> 00:29:30,451
and they grew. After they were cut.
That's a demon thing.

324
00:29:30,533 --> 00:29:34,845
- She has to be eliminated.
- Of course. It makes sense now.

325
00:29:34,933 --> 00:29:39,643
But you'd better show those bad puppies to
Giles before you do anything, just to be sure.

326
00:29:39,733 --> 00:29:43,169
Absolutely. I wouldn't wanna
do anything crazy.

327
00:29:43,893 --> 00:29:47,681
You hurry on to Giles.
I'll hang here and keep an eye on Kathy.

328
00:29:47,773 --> 00:29:51,288
Great. Good. Thanks, Will.

329
00:29:59,453 --> 00:30:05,244
Giles. I just talked to Buffy and, yeah,
I think she's feeling a little insane.

330
00:30:05,933 --> 00:30:10,609
No, not bitchy crazy.
More like homicidal-maniac crazy?

331
00:30:10,693 --> 00:30:13,048
So I told her to come see you, OK?

332
00:30:15,933 --> 00:30:17,924
Giles?

333
00:30:20,453 --> 00:30:22,444
Anybody home?

334
00:30:24,853 --> 00:30:26,650
Hello?

335
00:30:29,053 --> 00:30:32,443
What are you guys doing?
This is... this is ridiculous.

336
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:35,764
- This hurts me more than it hurts you.
- Not yet, but it will.

337
00:30:35,893 --> 00:30:37,531
Don't say that.

338
00:30:38,093 --> 00:30:39,765
Please don't say that.

339
00:30:39,853 --> 00:30:43,687
We're doing this to stop you
from making a terrible mistake.

340
00:30:45,693 --> 00:30:47,968
Clearly, something is amiss.

341
00:30:48,053 --> 00:30:50,521
Yeah, something's amiss,
a Miss Kathy Newman.

342
00:30:50,613 --> 00:30:53,002
Giles. Giles, look in my bag.

343
00:30:53,093 --> 00:30:58,645
Look in the bottom pocket of my bag. She
has parts that grow after they're detached.

344
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:02,965
She irons her jeans. She's evil.
She has to be destroyed.

345
00:31:03,053 --> 00:31:06,728
I fear the demon that Buffy met in the woods
has somehow possessed her.

346
00:31:06,813 --> 00:31:10,328
- Lite FM. Nothing but love songs.
- You think?

347
00:31:11,133 --> 00:31:16,571
You stay and watch her. I know a spell that
will reveal the demon so that we can fight it,

348
00:31:16,653 --> 00:31:20,043
but I need to get some supplies
from the magic shop.

349
00:31:20,133 --> 00:31:23,762
Buffy, l... See you around.

350
00:31:32,453 --> 00:31:34,205
- Can I come in?
- Sure.

351
00:31:36,893 --> 00:31:40,522
- Where's Buffy?
- I don't know exactly.

352
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:47,925
But I've been thinking. You and Buffy
should give each other some apart time.

353
00:31:48,013 --> 00:31:52,529
In fact, you might wanna be apart
before she gets back.

354
00:31:52,613 --> 00:31:55,286
What do you mean?
I should leave the room?

355
00:31:55,373 --> 00:31:58,604
- Why should I go?
- It's not fair, I know.

356
00:31:58,893 --> 00:32:03,091
You bet it's not fair, having to live
with someone who's obviously troubled.

357
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:06,449
Someone who so clearly needs
to be in a home, not in a dorm.

358
00:32:06,853 --> 00:32:10,732
I don't know about that.
Buffy's going through something, yes, but...

359
00:32:10,813 --> 00:32:15,204
I wouldn't put it past her to drop out, or
take off. Do something horrible to herself.

360
00:32:15,293 --> 00:32:19,286
- Herself?
- Or worse. She's capable of it, you know.

361
00:32:19,773 --> 00:32:23,083
You can see it
in those shifty little eyes of hers.

362
00:32:23,173 --> 00:32:25,812
One of these days
she might push somebody too far.

363
00:32:29,773 --> 00:32:31,764
Hello?

364
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:34,324
It's Oz.

365
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:39,210
Hi. You did? She's at Giles'. OK.

366
00:32:40,773 --> 00:32:46,484
You know, during that really
short phone call I realised you are so right.

367
00:32:46,573 --> 00:32:51,249
I mean, it's not fair to make you
leave your own room. So, you're good.

368
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:53,722
You just stay, right there. OK?

369
00:32:55,453 --> 00:32:56,966
I can't believe this.

370
00:32:57,053 --> 00:33:01,569
After all we've been through, and you won't
believe me when I tell you that Kathy is bad.

371
00:33:01,653 --> 00:33:04,690
- We want to, Buff. It's just...
- Don't engage.

372
00:33:07,373 --> 00:33:10,365
I don't know if I tightened
those ropes enough.

373
00:33:11,213 --> 00:33:14,569
Well, then we'd better
go over there and check 'em.

374
00:33:18,013 --> 00:33:20,049
Oh, dear God.

375
00:33:22,773 --> 00:33:24,764
Avoid the legs.

376
00:33:25,853 --> 00:33:27,844
Avoid the legs.

377
00:33:32,853 --> 00:33:34,844
Nope, not tight enough.

378
00:33:46,053 --> 00:33:47,725
Kathy.

379
00:33:48,573 --> 00:33:50,245
Buffy.

380
00:33:51,373 --> 00:33:53,648
I think we need to talk, don't you?

381
00:33:55,253 --> 00:33:58,563
Absolutely. Let's talk.

382
00:34:02,853 --> 00:34:04,571
Look what I did.

383
00:34:07,813 --> 00:34:09,963
Look what I did.

384
00:34:21,533 --> 00:34:24,047
I knew it.

385
00:34:45,133 --> 00:34:48,443
- Quit it.
- I knew it. I knew you were a demon.

386
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:51,366
Why don't you just stuff it
and let me finish my ritual?

387
00:34:51,453 --> 00:34:53,762
- Ritual?
- "The ritual of Mok'tagar,

388
00:34:53,853 --> 00:34:57,448
trans-dimensional demons:
forced ingestion of animal blood

389
00:34:57,533 --> 00:34:59,524
while the victim slumbers."

390
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:02,764
- Buffy's nightmares...
- ..were real.

391
00:35:02,853 --> 00:35:07,847
I'm sorry, OK? I left my dimension to go
to college and they sent these guys after me.

392
00:35:07,933 --> 00:35:11,289
"While they can assume many forms
and guises, including human,

393
00:35:11,373 --> 00:35:15,127
they can always be recognised
by others of their kind

394
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:16,805
due to the lack of a soul."

395
00:35:16,893 --> 00:35:19,487
- So I'm borrowing yours.
- Without even asking.

396
00:35:19,573 --> 00:35:23,452
Tonight, when they come looking for me,
they'll take the one without a soul.

397
00:35:23,533 --> 00:35:28,243
- I won't have to watch you floss.
- And I won't have to live with a slob.

398
00:35:48,853 --> 00:35:51,572
It's share time, Buffy.

399
00:35:55,613 --> 00:35:58,446
Fine. Then let's start with my sweater.

400
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:15,849
Why couldn't Giles have shackles
like any self-respecting bachelor?

401
00:36:15,933 --> 00:36:18,527
Guys, I just saw Kathy and she's acting...

402
00:36:18,853 --> 00:36:20,969
- Oh, my God. Are you OK?
- Yeah.

403
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:25,251
- Buffy's got a pretty good lead on us.
- I'll call Kathy, tell her to get out of there.

404
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:29,963
All you had to do was
write down your calls.

405
00:36:31,133 --> 00:36:33,124
- No answer.
- Toenails.

406
00:36:34,653 --> 00:36:38,407
Buffy's right. Kathy's toenails
not only grow after they're cut,

407
00:36:38,493 --> 00:36:41,087
they actually regenerate
if they’re destroyed.

408
00:36:41,173 --> 00:36:44,563
- And that's a demon thing?
- Unequivocally, yes. So...

409
00:36:45,053 --> 00:36:47,044
Where is Buffy?

410
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:51,331
Oh, dear, we have
even less time than I feared.

411
00:36:51,413 --> 00:36:53,847
I've looked up all known
regenerating demons.

412
00:36:53,933 --> 00:36:58,165
Only one species practises the ritual
that Buffy's been seeing in her sleep.

413
00:36:58,253 --> 00:37:00,528
It's used to steal the soul from a human body.

414
00:37:00,613 --> 00:37:05,323
Wait. Has Buffy been doing a Linda Blair on
us because Kathy's been sucking her soul?

415
00:37:05,413 --> 00:37:08,928
- I believe so, yes. Excuse me, please.
- So Buffy was right all along.

416
00:37:09,013 --> 00:37:12,926
- Later on, big remorse.
- Now, I've found a spell that should

417
00:37:13,013 --> 00:37:17,564
reverse the soul transfer procedure
immediately. Willow and I will perform it.

418
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:20,850
Leaving Xander and me
to help Buffy in the flesh.

419
00:37:20,933 --> 00:37:23,925
"Hear me, elders of the upper reaches."

420
00:37:24,013 --> 00:37:29,007
"Elders of the lower reaches. Elders
of the dry land. Elders of the river flats."

421
00:37:46,133 --> 00:37:49,523
Do you mind? People are trying to study.

422
00:37:57,333 --> 00:38:01,212
"Ancients, I beseech you. The soul,
abstracted, let it revert to its true seat."

423
00:38:02,453 --> 00:38:04,762
The window's open. Happy?

424
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:13,528
Open up. Let me finish.

425
00:38:13,613 --> 00:38:14,762
"Let it be finished."

426
00:38:14,853 --> 00:38:18,289
"Let the unnatural vessel be emptied. Let
the essence be returned to its original host."

427
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:31,164
How did you do...?

428
00:39:35,533 --> 00:39:38,650
- How's that?
- A little to the left.

429
00:39:39,613 --> 00:39:41,604
There. Perfect.

430
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:43,844
I'm so glad you're here, Will.

431
00:39:43,933 --> 00:39:46,925
I can already feel all that bad
Kathy karma draining away.

432
00:39:47,573 --> 00:39:50,167
About that. The Kathy thing?

433
00:39:50,253 --> 00:39:54,132
- I'm sorry I doubted you.
- You're completely forgiven.

434
00:39:54,213 --> 00:39:56,204
I mean, you had reason to doubt.

435
00:39:56,293 --> 00:40:01,492
Except for the soul-sucking thing, I bet Kathy
was pretty regular - as far as roomies go.

436
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:04,765
- That's a pretty big "except".
- I guess.

437
00:40:04,853 --> 00:40:08,641
I'm just glad that it was Kathy's
demony ways making me No-Fun Buffy.

438
00:40:08,733 --> 00:40:10,963
I've always thought I was pretty easy-going.

439
00:40:11,053 --> 00:40:14,363
It's not like I have the big issues.
I don't burn incense or...

440
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,125
Are you gonna finish this?

441
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:28,842
