1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,998
Come to my family again
and you and I are at war.

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,630
- Eat your children!
- No!

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,916
Hyde's an animal, I'm dangerous.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,479
Hi Honey, I'm home.

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,108
- Where's my husband?
- Tom's gone Honey.

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,512
Tonight is everything this organisation
has worked towards ever since it began.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,188
Tonight is the culmination
of over one hundred years of planning.

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,757
There now, Benjamin,
it'll be over in a moment.

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,514
Dr Jackman is coming home.

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,274
No, for God's sake, no! Please! No!!

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,954
You won't be needing
this any more. Sorry.

12
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,394
Claire! No!

13
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,634
Peter, for God's sake,
he has claustrophobia.

14
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,800
I know.

15
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,591
Sorry, dropped the phone.

16
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,671
What time did you say?

17
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,994
You OK in there? Need a refill?

18
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,063
No, I'm fine, thanks.

19
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,756
That'll be Claire.

20
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,480
Hey.

21
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,998
- Hey. Am I late?
- No.

22
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,390
- Can I try again?
- Come on, I'm still cooking.

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,677
Yeah, well, I was trying to be late.

24
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,956
Oh, shit!

25
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,478
Sorry, no offence.

26
00:01:54,472 --> 00:01:55,497
OK.

27
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,080
See ya!

28
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,471
Who asked you to set me up?

29
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,232
Uh, whoever asked you to do that?

30
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,640
- You did.
- Apart from me.

31
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,846
- Good-Iooking, isn't he?
- Didn't notice.

32
00:02:08,966 --> 00:02:11,629
Not my type. Not interested.

33
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,109
And those glasses
are going to have to go.

34
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,430
- Damn it!
- Gotcha!

35
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,239
I'm going to have to drink now.
I brought my car.

36
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,960
Take these through, talk to him.

37
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,156
- God!
- And Claire, don't, you know...

38
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,515
- What?
- You know.

39
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,309
- Men like a sense of humour.
- Yeah, theirs. And don't scare him.

40
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,424
Don't be scary,
don't be funny, gotcha.

41
00:02:32,544 --> 00:02:33,916
Don't get onto what he earns.

42
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,355
- I don't do that.
- You always do that.

43
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,310
No funny, no scary, no money.
How hard can it be?

44
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,710
I give her one sentence.

45
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,353
So, what do you do?

46
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,715
Rich men.

47
00:02:58,338 --> 00:03:02,157
Sorry, it's a joke. Sorry.

48
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,520
OK?

49
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,879
Yes, er... just, er...

50
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,120
...admiring the patio.

51
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,158
Did you have that last time?

52
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,320
Yes.

53
00:03:23,526 --> 00:03:24,526
OK.

54
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,273
It's nice, though, it's a nice patio.

55
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,469
All right?

56
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,993
- Need any help?
- Do you?

57
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,160
No, no.

58
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,756
All your own work?

59
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,359
The garden?

60
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,556
Except the patio.

61
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,510
So, Tom, how's work?

62
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,796
Oh, you know.

63
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,953
Same as ever.

64
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,592
- Tom's a research scientist.
- Ah, a scientist, right.

65
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,269
What do you do?

66
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,634
About 250,000 a year.

67
00:04:31,611 --> 00:04:34,436
Sorry, hang on a minute.

68
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,113
- Your cab, I said five minutes.
- So early.

69
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,396
Yes, sorry, got a meeting first thing.

70
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,959
What's wrong?

71
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,953
- I've lost my shoes.
- How can you lose your shoes?

72
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,509
- Did you take them off?
- Obviously.

73
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,639
You check the bathroom,
I'll look next door.

74
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,030
Do you always take
your shoes off when you eat?

75
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,228
- Yes. Did you hide them?
- Mm-hm.

76
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
Why?

77
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,434
You were leaving.

78
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,829
- Oh, my God!
- I know.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,878
- You barely spoke.
- We still haven't.

80
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,395
- Tell me everything. Disgust me.
- Who's that?

81
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,710
- Nobody, my mother, go away.
- OK.

82
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,392
He's up. Later.

83
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,791
We've still got his shoes.
Do you want me to send them round?

84
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,518
No hurry.

85
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,120
Tom?

86
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,560
Yeah?

87
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,889
<i>Is there a man's dressing gown
in there?</i>

88
00:06:18,427 --> 00:06:19,427
Yes.

89
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,272
I was hoping you wouldn't notice it.

90
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,513
Was specifically pointing it out
part of the plan?

91
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,316
Old boyfriend?

92
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,994
He is now.

93
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
Ah!

94
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,433
Twins in the family either of you?

95
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,600
No.

96
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,715
Well, there's news on that.
It's twins.

97
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,233
- But we had scans.
- Tom.

98
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,598
- The scans were wrong.
- There was one heartbeat.

99
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,397
Now bring it to me, that's it,
nice and slow. Careful. Good.

100
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,799
Tell him he's here.

101
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,996
Gemini has landed.

102
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,628
"Gemini"?! For God's sake
who thought that one up?

103
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,873
Is that supposed to be clever? And let
go of her, she's not going anywhere.

104
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,998
Claire, I'm sorry, we have
some questions, it may take a while.

105
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,229
Some questions?

106
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,436
I apologise in advance for the coffee.

107
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,717
- You have some questions?
- A few, yes.

108
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,953
You have my husband in a box!

109
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,588
Don't let them hear you call it a box,
the tech boys.

110
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,866
Total self-contained
life-support system.

111
00:08:31,986 --> 00:08:33,958
It's the safest place
in the world, apparently.

112
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,113
As long as the batteries don't run out.
Let her go, it's fine.

113
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,118
What's that? What's that noise?

114
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,674
He's having a sort of...
Well, a sort of panic attack.

115
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,673
Get him downstairs,
let's get him stabilised.

116
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,159
OK. To me guys, come on.

117
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,833
Be careful, though. Slowly.

118
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,116
Uh, Claire, this way.

119
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,672
Mrs Jackman.

120
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,752
Maybe you should call me
Mrs Jackman now, what do you think?

121
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,799
Mrs Jackman.

122
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,793
- Morning, Dr Jackman.
- Morning.

123
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,838
- Mrs Jackman all right?
- Fine.

124
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,116
- How was your weekend?
- Twins.

125
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,824
Twins!

126
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,639
Sorry, could you do that
again for me, please?

127
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,153
Did I bring the wrong thumb?

128
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,339
How long have they kept you here?

129
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:35,229
- Idiots.
- Is there a problem?

130
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,675
Only with our equipment.
They'll fire someone.

131
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,356
It's an American company,
they like to feel dynamic.

132
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,988
You haven't been down here.
I'll show you to the lift.

133
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,993
I didn't know there was a down here.

134
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,034
- Who's that?
- Oh, for God's sake!

135
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,479
- Who is that?
- Another American. Hard to keep up,

136
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,154
they keep sacking each other.
I don't know their names.

137
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,231
There are women here
you haven't slept with?

138
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,279
- Why so many rumours about me?
- Probably all the sex.

139
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:17,070
- Oh, here, use mine.
- That's OK. We have to use mine here.

140
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,160
- I thought I'd clearance everywhere.
- You're down the rabbit hole now.

141
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,589
Everything you think is wrong.

142
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,274
- Sorry, can I take the stairs?
- What's the problem?

143
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,284
I'm sorry,
it's just I have claustrophobia.

144
00:11:34,404 --> 00:11:35,989
I know.

145
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,111
You know where we are I suppose?

146
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,716
- Where Tom worked.
- Where you thought Tom worked.

147
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,917
- Where he thought he worked.
- Where are we going?

148
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,073
Down the rabbit hole,
where everything you think is wrong.

149
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,313
Whatever my husband is, putting him
in a box doesn't make you his friend.

150
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,918
I'll tell you what it makes me,
what it makes a lot of people, rich.

151
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,753
Very, very rich.

152
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,075
- Oh, Sally.
- Um, I'm... I'm leaving.

153
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,392
- Yeah, well, it's late.
- Yeah, no, I'm... I'm leaving

154
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,199
and I'm... I'm not working
any notice either.

155
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,150
- What... what are these supposed to be?
- Just some notes for tomorrow.

156
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,992
Is it a joke?

157
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,789
Is it... Is it... s-sexual?

158
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,349
If it is s-sexual,

159
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,308
l-I can sue you for... for harassment.

160
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,271
Wh... I didn't write these.

161
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,318
It... it's your handwriting.

162
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,600
Yes. Yes it is.

163
00:13:09,101 --> 00:13:10,218
Yes it is.

164
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,879
Mind not on the game, is it?
Fantastic, let's keep going.

165
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,359
I need to talk to you.

166
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,876
- So what do you think?
- Of what?

167
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,679
- My symptoms.
- Look 'em up on the internet.

168
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,274
- You're a doctor.
- Yes, I'm a doctor.

169
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,793
Know what I do with symptoms?

170
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,673
I look 'em up on the internet.

171
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,911
It's open.
OK, hair on my arm out of nowhere.

172
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,254
How do you explain that?

173
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:04,437
Easy, you imagined it.
Because it's impossible.

174
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,703
OK, my thumb print?

175
00:14:06,823 --> 00:14:09,720
Fault in the machinery,
like they told you.

176
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,789
I don't think
they were telling me the truth.

177
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:13,270
You imagined that too.

178
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:16,432
Just push, it's open.

179
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,995
OK, so why am I writing pages
of rubbish to my PA?

180
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,993
- Pages and pages of...
- Yeah, that's... that's my favourite.

181
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,152
"I'm coming." Talk about repressed.

182
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,108
- Who cracks one off in print?
- Could you take this seriously?

183
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,131
Stress, common or garden stress.

184
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,469
- I prescribe a holiday.
- For Christ's sake!

185
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,158
Where did they go?

186
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,072
- Where did who go?
- The door knocked.

187
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,915
- It didn't.
- I heard them.

188
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,389
Tom, nobody knocked.

189
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,837
Three words, ho-li-day.

190
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,789
I'll be with you shortly

191
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,635
and there'll be somebody
on the door if you want anything.

192
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,632
I warned you about the coffee, didn't I?

193
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:33,077
Remember you said "rich"
on the day you took my family,

194
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,836
on the day you took my children
and put my husband in a box.

195
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,390
Remember you said "rich".

196
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,954
I apologise for the coffee.

197
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,360
Hello?

198
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,035
- A handful, isn't she?
<i>- Who's this?</i>

199
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,509
And attractive too,
I'm sure you've noticed,

200
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,399
but you have an eye
for the ladies, don't you, Mr Syme?

201
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,709
Pot, kettle.

202
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,111
Although I'm not sure I'd trust you
with the wife of a friend.

203
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,317
- Pot, kettle.
<i>- Who is this? Who's speaking?</i>

204
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,357
Miranda Callendar, private investigator.

205
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,346
<i>Mrs Jackman paid me
to follow her husband,</i>

206
00:16:14,466 --> 00:16:16,513
your organisation paid me to stop.

207
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,912
- Peter, could I have a word with you?
- Sorry, just... Sorry, just one second.

208
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,595
<i>And you are Peter Syme,</i>
<i>lifelong friend of Tom Jackman</i>

209
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,070
and his principal betrayer
and abductor of his wife.

210
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,310
Abductor? What on earth
are you talking about?

211
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,675
I've watched her
being driven into your offices.

212
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,195
I'd say it was a pretty
full-on abduction.

213
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,716
Although maybe you just lock women up
in your basement, recreationally.

214
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,950
- Pot, kettle.
- Min!

215
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,032
I haven't the slightest idea
what you're talking about.

216
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,475
There's some woman
called Miranda Callendar,

217
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,915
check her out.
Claims to be a private detective.

218
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,116
- Says we paid her off.
- On it.

219
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,633
- Peter...
- What is it?

220
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,915
- Excuse me...
- Meg...

221
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,514
- Peter.
- Take my coat. Thank you. What is it?

222
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,989
- Can we go outside?
- Why?

223
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,631
Mr Syme, she says
that she wants to speak to my boyfriend.

224
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,759
- Yes?
<i>- She's very attractive too.</i>

225
00:17:08,947 --> 00:17:10,471
I am impressed.

226
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,756
What is your secret?
Money or conversation?

227
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,232
Is there a point to this?

228
00:17:14,352 --> 00:17:16,515
<i>I'm outside,
I'd like you to let me in.</i>

229
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,829
And why would I do that?

230
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,151
<i>Because you're a bad boy</i>
<i>and I'm a good detective.</i>

231
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,633
<i>- Hello?</i>
<i>- Oh, you are a busy boy, aren't you?</i>

232
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,360
<i>- I hope you're taking vitamins.</i>
- What are you doing?

233
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,637
<i>- Open up.</i>
- Are you serious?

234
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,431
- Hello?
- You can phone everyone

235
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,229
I've ever slept with in the entire
building, you are not coming in here!

236
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,713
Go home, this doesn't work.

237
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,233
<i>I know, but this will.</i>

238
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,790
I want to speak to Winston Churchill.

239
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,397
Oh, and I don't mean that dreadful MP,
I mean the real one, the war leader.

240
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,951
<i>I want to speak to the real actual</i>
<i>Winston Churchill.</i>

241
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,429
I'm such a fan.

242
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,393
Winston Churchill?

243
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,996
If you're lucky, I'll introduce you.

244
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,397
It's the best holiday ever.

245
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,074
<i> Your kids are having</i>
<i>a good time too, since you ask </i>

246
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,087
Kids? We have kids?

247
00:18:30,207 --> 00:18:33,314
So that sea air's working
its magic, then?

248
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,156
Mm, nightly. Sometimes afternoonly,
couple of times morningly.

249
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,517
You hear that sound?
That's me going green with envy.

250
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,989
<i>That's the sound of green.</i>

251
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,799
- Want to know a secret?
<i>- Nah, secret? Course not.</i>

252
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,473
<i>Yes, I want to know a secret.</i>

253
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,918
- You won't believe me.
<i>- Sounds brilliant.</i>

254
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,231
- I turn his eyes black.
- What?

255
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,076
Seriously. His eyes,
they go jet black every time.

256
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,310
Like mine.

257
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,599
- Dead sexy.
<i>- What do you mean, they go black? When?</i>

258
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,035
- Every time.
- Tom's got brown eyes.

259
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,192
- Am I good, or what?
- That's not possible, is that possible?

260
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,510
- I don't think that's possible. David?
- Yes?

261
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,750
<i>- Don't ask David.</i>
- Nothing, never mind.

262
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,920
OK.

263
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,828
My name's Jake.

264
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,513
Claire, are you all right?

265
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,874
- Like my bike?
- Claire? Who's that speaking?

266
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,793
Nobody, it's OK. I've got to go.

267
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,877
Do you want a go on it?

268
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:41,717
- My bike. There's room for a small one.
- Sorry, no. No, thank you.

269
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,955
She said no.

270
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,475
- Well, her skirt says yes.
- I'm her husband, she said no.

271
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,155
Her husband? Did you lose a bet?

272
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,476
We're just out for a walk,
we don't want any trouble.

273
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,676
Oh, you don't, that's good.

274
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,637
We just want to go back to our hotel...

275
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,998
- He's not your husband.
- Yes. Yes, he is.

276
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,879
I am her husband and we'd like
to go now, so if you could...

277
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:16,353
I'll prove it. OK. Watch this.

278
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,278
Are you watching me now?

279
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,397
Now, would your husband let me do this?

280
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,789
Well, come on.
Would your husband let me do that?

281
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,679
Please. Just leave him.

282
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,071
But you can see what I'm saying.

283
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,633
Would he let me do that?
What do you think?

284
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,951
- Yes, he would.
- Oh, OK.

285
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,755
So how about this?

286
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,675
Would he let me do this?

287
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,037
Please, stop.

288
00:21:20,827 --> 00:21:21,827
No.

289
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,760
Tom?

290
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,240
Just...

291
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,870
Just let him.

292
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,511
- It'll be OK.
- Yeah, just let me.

293
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
There.

294
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Tom!

295
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,034
It'll be over in a minute.

296
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,794
Finishing touches.

297
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,034
Very nice.

298
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,429
Help yourself to the other one.
You're her husband.

299
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,916
Let's go.

300
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,760
Only me. You all right?

301
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,672
Yeah. Yes, of course.

302
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,071
- Drinks on the way?
- Yeah.

303
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,198
Come on, lover, let's sit.

304
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,592
We could eat here tonight,
what do you think?

305
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,398
I haven't booked.

306
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,518
I'll flirt with the maître d'

307
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,671
- Kind of late, isn't it?
- What for?

308
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,118
- Ice-cream van.
- There isn't any ice-cream van.

309
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,878
Tom, there were too many of them.

310
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,760
I know.

311
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,748
And anyway...

312
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:21,755
I don't want the kind of man that
gets involved in that kind of fight.

313
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,595
- Don't you?
- Of course I don't.

314
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,240
OK.

315
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,150
I'm off to flirt with the maître d'

316
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,949
Lighten up or I'm going all the way.

317
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,708
- Is someone coming?
- What?

318
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,030
Why have you brought three?

319
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,714
You asked for three.
Do you want me to take it away?

320
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,030
- Yes.
- No problem.

321
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,751
Right, I'll go and see
what I can do about a table.

322
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,229
Don't wait up.

323
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,629
Oh, sorry. Um...

324
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,758
I was just, er... Sorry.

325
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,559
No problem, sir.
Could you sign for the drinks?

326
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,720
Yes.

327
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,317
Thank you, sir. Have a good evening.

328
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,038
# <i>A heart of stone, a smoking gun</i>

329
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,510
# <i>I can give you life...</i>

330
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,433
- Where you off to?
- Slash.

331
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,440
Tom?

332
00:26:48,716 --> 00:26:49,720
Tom?

333
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,831
I told you. I think he went out
the window.

334
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,798
Why would he go out the window?

335
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,633
Where would he go?

336
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,908
It's funny,
just don't know why I want to hurt you.

337
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,911
Don't even know your name.

338
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,753
Don't know my name.

339
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,797
Please...

340
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,872
Just woke up wanting to hurt you.

341
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,314
Please, don't.

342
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,835
I was born to hurt you.

343
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,274
Please...

344
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,112
And do you know what?

345
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,836
It just never gets old.

346
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,758
What do you say, lover?
Ready to go again?

347
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:56,074
- Please. Please, don't...
- Just let me.

348
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,514
No, please...

349
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:02,196
Now, now,
it'll be over in a minute.

350
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,518
Finishing touches.

351
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,158
# <i>I wanted to bite not destroy</i>

352
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,471
# <i>To feel her underneath</i>

353
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,235
# <i>Turning into the light</i>

354
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,795
# <i>Cos I'm on fire</i>

355
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,628
- # <i>Cos I'm on fire...</i>
- Oi, look at this.

356
00:28:41,293 --> 00:28:43,056
Oh, please!

357
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,711
Oh, God!

358
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,280
What?

359
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:23,239
- She'll be here any second.
- Oh, jolly good. Do sit down.

360
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,879
Thank you.

361
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,589
Just to remind us why we're all here.

362
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,149
I hope your hand's
as strong as you think it is.

363
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,834
No, you don't.

364
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,638
Ah, Claire.

365
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,473
Mrs Jackman.

366
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,950
Mrs Jackman.
Miranda Callendar, I think you know,

367
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,678
the detective you employed.

368
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,957
She's been a little unforthcoming
on what she found.

369
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,997
Do I get a refund?

370
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,310
And this is, er... Min, her assistant.

371
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,677
- Actually I'm a detective too.
- No, she isn't.

372
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,319
- I'm on the cusp.
- You're not.

373
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,710
- It's a grey area.
- Min!

374
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,995
And this is Katherine Reimer, of course,
I'm sure Tom's mentioned her.

375
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,912
I've heard a lot about you.

376
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,169
I've heard bloody nothing
about you, dear.

377
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:08,834
I work for your husband.

378
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,514
Do you dress like that
or do you wear clothes?

379
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,318
- I wear clothes.
- Does he notice?

380
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,436
Half the time.

381
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,437
Everyone here is aware of your
husband's... interesting condition.

382
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,310
Great! You all knew. Fantastic!

383
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,756
No one think it was worth telling me
I married a werewolf?

384
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:35,233
You didn't marry a werewolf,
Mrs Jackman, you married Dr Jekyll.

385
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,152
Dr Jekyll?

386
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,553
Dr Henry Jekyll died
in Edinburgh in 1886.

387
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,508
- Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde?
- Yes.

388
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,237
Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde was a story.

389
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,358
- No, it wasn't.
- No, it isn't.

390
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,522
OK...

391
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:57,195
Sorry.

392
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,672
Just, um...
just trying to catch up here,

393
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,592
just trying to be clear.

394
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,356
- I married Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde?
- Yes, you did.

395
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,832
Come on, seriously?
I'm Mrs Jekyll and Hyde?

396
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,579
Yes, you are.

397
00:31:17,628 --> 00:31:22,959
That's so like a man, isn't it? There's
always something they're not telling you.

398
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,759
- "Sorry, should have said, I'm Dracula!"
- This is not a joke.

399
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,390
- This is not serious!
- Henry Jekyll died without issue.

400
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,551
- He's the last of the Jekyll line.
- Sorry?

401
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,076
- That means no children.
- I know what it means!

402
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,753
Tom can't be Jekyll's descendent,

403
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,115
because Henry Jekyll had no descendants.

404
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,556
- But that doesn't make any sense.
- No, none whatsoever.

405
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,432
Um, what has Tom told you
about his parents?

406
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,519
He was fostered.
His mother abandoned him.

407
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,395
On a railway platform
in Belfast in 1967,

408
00:31:58,557 --> 00:32:00,276
six months after he was born.

409
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,590
I don't believe that.

410
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,036
- You don't think he was abandoned?
- I don't think he was born.

411
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,035
Yes? Excuse me.

412
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,829
But please,
I don't want to miss anything.

413
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,278
<i>- Ready?</i>
- As soon as you say.

414
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,795
- Is she there?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

415
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,509
- How's she been?
- Well, in fairness, she's jet-lagged.

416
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,069
I shudder to contemplate.
Might as well get started.

417
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,516
I'm just going to say this again,
you know that there's no guarantee.

418
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,636
I know, good luck.

419
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,795
Thank you. OK everyone, it's a go.

420
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,713
We're going to have to clear the room.

421
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,431
Miss Utterson,
we're clearing the room now.

422
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,477
Of course.

423
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,314
<i> Where are you?</i>

424
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,234
I went to the hospital.
I don't know, I feel, I feel...

425
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,994
You've been gone a whole night!
Where have you been?

426
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,071
<i>I don't know. I woke up on the beach.</i>

427
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,516
Claire, it's weird, I feel... I feel...

428
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,999
You feel what?

429
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,958
Fantastic. I feel fantastic.

430
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:21,591
- What have you been doing?
- I don't know, I just, I feel...

431
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,638
- I don't need my glasses.
- What?

432
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,360
I don't need them,
I don't know where they are.

433
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:32,594
I can see perfectly. 20/20 vision,
it's like being a kid again. I can see!

434
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,309
- Do you... do you have your wallet?
- My wallet?!

435
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,358
Have you had a bang on the head?
You're not making any sense.

436
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,317
How could that fix my eyesight?

437
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,623
I don't know!

438
00:34:42,743 --> 00:34:47,715
Something bad's happened to you,
and it hasn't fixed your eyesight.

439
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,236
Just... just check your wallet.

440
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,437
For God's sake,
I'm telling you, I can see.

441
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,639
<i>Tom, where's the hospital?</i>
<i>I'm coming over.</i>

442
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,190
Tom? Where's the hospital?

443
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,360
Tom?

444
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,678
Come on, come on.

445
00:36:19,826 --> 00:36:22,149
Shit. Shit.

446
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,520
Shit.

447
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,672
- No, get down.
- Everything OK?

448
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:38,192
- Are you all right in there?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

449
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,960
Go!

450
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,400
Jesus!

451
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,554
Who are you?

452
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,438
What are you?

453
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,635
OK, this way.

454
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,078
Sorry about the lights.
Here you are, watch your step.

455
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,312
I mean you've got to think fixer-upper.

456
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,315
But there's a lot of potential here,
there's a lot of... rooms.

457
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,435
OK. I can read a face, me.

458
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,433
There's a couple of rentals
in Hammersmith,

459
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,592
they'd probably be more up
your street.

460
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,880
I mean this place... I know
I shouldn't say it, but quite honestly,

461
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,634
I wouldn't lock up
my worst enemy in this place.

462
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,433
I would.

463
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,358
Dr Henry Jekyll died
in Edinburgh in 1886.

464
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,829
Six months after his death,
his research notes,

465
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,753
plus whatever survived
from his various experiments,

466
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,388
passed into the ownership
of a newly-formed company,

467
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,260
Klein & Utterson.

468
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:11,395
Klein & Utterson
still survive to this day.

469
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,314
And how do you find them
as an employer, Mr Syme?

470
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,869
- American.
- Ooh, and initially Scottish.

471
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,508
A frightening combination.

472
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,831
Klein & Utterson also took possession
of something else,

473
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,912
the body of Dr Henry Jekyll.

474
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,437
- How am I doing?
- Fascinating fairy tale.

475
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,239
There's a copy of this fairy tale
with my lawyer.

476
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,073
I hope that's enough to secure
my safety for the evening?

477
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,869
Oh, absolutely.
You should definitely hope that.

478
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,551
In the 70 years following
Henry Jekyll's death,

479
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,350
and in total secrecy, there were, I think,
16 attempts to recreate his experiment,

480
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,512
resulting in sixteen deaths.

481
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:56,559
And then in 1965 Winston Churchill died.

482
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,592
In the papers a few months later,
a silly season story

483
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,990
about our old friends Klein & Utterson

484
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,436
and how they were going to
bring good old Winston back.

485
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,600
How?

486
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:16,029
Cloning. A clone. Created from the DNA
harvested from his body.

487
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,512
A brand new grow-your-own Winston.
How is that going, by the way?

488
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,680
Is he done?

489
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,633
You were going to make a clone
of Winston Churchill?

490
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,190
Of course not. Just some bloody idiot
mouthing off in a pub.

491
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,477
Trying to impress a girl from Hull,
according to the records.

492
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:36,509
Unfortunately, her father worked
for one of our more esteemed tabloids.

493
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,875
You weren't trying to clone
Winston Churchill,

494
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,474
you were trying to clone Henry Jekyll.

495
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,518
After all those years of failing
to recreate his experiment,

496
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,885
you finally decided
to throw in the towel

497
00:41:47,018 --> 00:41:49,310
and recreate the man himself.

498
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,830
How am I doing now?

499
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,197
It took until 1997 to successfully
clone a sheep.

500
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,035
Do you really imagine in 1965
we were able to clone a dead Victorian?

501
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:04,432
Klein & Utterson were successfully
cloning farm animals in the 1950s.

502
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,831
Anyone that tried to speak about it
ended up very rich or disappeared.

503
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,514
- Which are you hoping for?
- Neither.

504
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,548
You think Tom Jackman is a clone?

505
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,030
A genetic experiment, grown in a lab?

506
00:42:20,802 --> 00:42:21,802
Yes.

507
00:42:25,864 --> 00:42:26,864
I see.

508
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,948
Tell Colonel Hart we'll be needing him.

509
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,350
This is over.

510
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,399
- Why?
- Because Tom Jackman is not a clone.

511
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,518
You have nothing.

512
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,673
You have walked in here with nothing.

513
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,274
I'm sorry.

514
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,070
- Why are you sorry, Peter?
- Mr Syme?

515
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,912
So soon? Vital signs?

516
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,152
- All normal.
- What have you done to Tom?

517
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,118
I told you we had a cure,
what do you think we've done?

518
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,158
- You're going to cure him?
- No, we've already cured him.

519
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,356
- We should take Mrs Jackman with us.
- Why?

520
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,715
- Because she's entitled.
- What about them?

521
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,633
- They'll have to stay here.
- Why?

522
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:21,238
No, it's OK, you go, see your husband.
We'll see you again shortly.

523
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,400
Yeah.

524
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,232
Yeah, see you.

525
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,552
Bloody shame, actually.
You should have been working for me.

526
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,757
- You said I had nothing.
- Oh, nothing at all, really,

527
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,037
but you were so close.

528
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,718
But... if... if Henry Jekyll
had no descendants,

529
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,634
if Tom Jackman isn't a clone,
then where did he come from?

530
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,874
I was hoping you were going to tell us,
because we don't have the faintest idea.

531
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,120
<i>Daddy?</i>

532
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,755
<i>Is that you, Daddy?</i>

533
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,952
<i>Are you my daddy?</i>

534
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,837
<i>Did you want to know</i>
<i>what I look like, Daddy?</i>

535
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,156
<i>You did, didn't you?</i>

536
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,719
<i>What do you think? Are you proud?</i>

537
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,277
<i>What do you look like, Daddy?</i>

538
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,672
<i>Are you old? Are you really, really old?</i>

539
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,672
<i>You feel old. I can feel you in here.</i>

540
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:10,435
<i>Feel your thoughts. Old, dusty thoughts.</i>

541
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,239
<i>Old and scared.</i>

542
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,914
<i>Always so scared.</i>

543
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,390
<i>Why are you so scared, Daddy?</i>

544
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,355
<i>Are you scared of me?</i>

545
00:46:29,643 --> 00:46:30,857
<i>Are you married?</i>

546
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:33,962
<i>Do I have a mummy?</i>

547
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,274
<i>Or are you alone?</i>

548
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,635
<i>You feel alone.</i>

549
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,030
<i>You think alone.</i>

550
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,031
<i>I can feel what you think.</i>

551
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,030
<i>Think of a number.</i>

552
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:54,876
<i>No, do it Daddy, think of a number.</i>
<i>A big silly number, go on, it's a game.</i>

553
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,600
<i>Say it out loud, a big fat number,</i>
<i>any big fat number.</i>

554
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,432
- 103.
<i>- 103.</i>

555
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,431
Oh, God!

556
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,114
<i>I was right, wasn't I?</i>

557
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,192
<i>Bet I was.</i>

558
00:47:09,738 --> 00:47:10,900
<i>Waaah!</i>

559
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,556
<i>I'm in your head.</i>

560
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:17,474
<i>I know what you think.</i>
<i>I am what you think.</i>

561
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,029
<i>Scared now, aren't you, Daddy?</i>
<i>Scaredy Daddy.</i>

562
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,315
I'm not scared of you!

563
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,710
<i>Yes, you are.</i>

564
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,393
<i>I'm coming to get you, Daddy.</i>

565
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,518
<i>I'm coming to eat you, Daddy.</i>

566
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,949
<i>Oh, you've got
a vivid imagination, Daddy.</i>

567
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:54,071
<i>I've been there.</i>

568
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,073
You, shut up.

569
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,717
Shut up! Shut up!

570
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:04,880
Shut up!

571
00:48:06,858 --> 00:48:08,348
Shut up!

572
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,591
Just a moment.

573
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,713
- Who is it?
- Delivery, sir.

574
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:50,079
- I didn't order anything.
- 6 Stadler Street? Dr Jackman?

575
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,550
You phoned yesterday,
said it was an emergency.

576
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,395
New television, sir.

577
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,109
Do you want some help opening the box?

578
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,989
Why is he in that box?

579
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,833
It's the only way to keep him stable.

580
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,958
They'll be ready for us in a moment,
uh... Coffee?

581
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,918
- Could someone get some coffee?
- Why now?

582
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,469
You've had a cure
for over 50 years, you said.

583
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,438
Because your husband...

584
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,795
Claire...

585
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,428
Tom's dying.

586
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:46,593
Every change is shredding his DNA.
He won't see 45.

587
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:50,309
He may not even see the end of the
month. We couldn't wait any longer.

588
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,913
- We wanted to.
- Why?

589
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:55,072
- He's all yours in a minute.
- Thank you.

590
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,603
- Why did you want to wait?
- We know how to stabilise him

591
00:49:57,723 --> 00:50:00,154
and we've always known
how to stop the changes,

592
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:04,518
but we didn't know
in which form he'd stabilise.

593
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,671
- It's Hyde we want.
- I don't want Hyde.

594
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,070
I know.

595
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,511
- Watch out, it's hot.
- Go away.

596
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,398
It's all right.

597
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,915
Who is he now?

598
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,757
How do you know which one he's...

599
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,480
stabilised as?

600
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,471
We open the box.

601
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,154
And then what?

602
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:31,916
Either you take Dr Jackman home,
or Mr Hyde stays here.

603
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:36,596
- They're both my husband.
- No, no, no, Hyde is ours.

604
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,840
I see.

605
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,151
Well, then.

606
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,709
I'll have that coffee, thanks.

607
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,876
I'd wish you luck,
but you wouldn't believe me.

608
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,678
It's not an even chance, is it?

609
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,229
You wouldn't be doing this if it was.

610
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,913
You think it's Hyde in there.

611
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,277
- They do.
- You don't?

612
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,399
At every stage of this, Tom's been
stronger than anyone ever expected.

613
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,677
- I'd never bet against him.
- You sound like you're proud of him.

614
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:16,355
- He's my friend.
- Yes.

615
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,715
He's your friend.

616
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,029
- How hot?
- Very hot.

617
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,112
- Thanks.
- Arrgh! Jesus Christ!

618
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:29,670
- I apologise for the coffee.
- Well, then, what are you waiting for?

619
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:33,549
- Get my husband out of that bloody box!
- Shit!
