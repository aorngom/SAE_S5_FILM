1
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:07,675
Previously on "Stargate SG-1".:

2
00:00:07,765 --> 00:00:11,838
The replicators. They've launched
an all-out attack on the Goa'uld.

3
00:00:11,925 --> 00:00:17,363
If the Goa'uld can't stop them,
they'll overrun our galaxy within weeks.

4
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:18,639
Daniel!

5
00:00:18,725 --> 00:00:23,958
Unfortunately, to get what I need,
we're going to have to dig a little deeper.

6
00:00:24,045 --> 00:00:27,560
We must once and for all destroy
the Goa'uld's image as gods forever.

7
00:00:27,645 --> 00:00:30,523
- How?
- By capturing the temple at Dakara.

8
00:00:30,605 --> 00:00:33,802
There's a way to defeat the replicators
in my memories, isn't there?

9
00:00:33,885 --> 00:00:35,876
You need only to open your mind to it.

10
00:00:35,965 --> 00:00:39,401
A force of rebel Jaffa have managed
to take control of the temple at Dakara.

11
00:00:39,485 --> 00:00:45,162
Have the fleet disengage their battle with
the replicators. Take it back at all costs.

12
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:48,601
The ruins of an Ancient monument
on a planet now called Dakara.

13
00:00:48,685 --> 00:00:53,361
Within it is the one weapon
in this galaxy capable of destroying me.

14
00:00:57,325 --> 00:01:00,954
A device capable of destroying
all life in the galaxy?

15
00:01:01,045 --> 00:01:05,721
- That's what he said.
- Baal said he was serving Anubis.

16
00:01:05,805 --> 00:01:09,764
Not exactly.
You know those Goa'uld and their egos.

17
00:01:09,845 --> 00:01:12,154
He would never admit
to being subservient.

18
00:01:12,245 --> 00:01:16,318
No. He said he was biding his time,
learning what he could from Anubis.

19
00:01:16,405 --> 00:01:18,441
Probably looking for a way to kill him.

20
00:01:18,525 --> 00:01:22,359
We have no idea how this Ancient device
works or what the effects will be,

21
00:01:22,445 --> 00:01:26,757
but since Anubis has no real corporeal
form, it's likely he would survive it.

22
00:01:26,845 --> 00:01:29,200
- He'd have no one left to rule.
- For now.

23
00:01:29,285 --> 00:01:31,799
Time may not be an issue
for someone like him.

24
00:01:31,885 --> 00:01:35,719
He could start over, repopulate
the galaxy to his own specifications.

25
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:39,480
- That's a little ambitious.
- He has some knowledge of the Ancients.

26
00:01:39,565 --> 00:01:41,556
I wouldn't put it past him.

27
00:01:41,645 --> 00:01:42,839
No.

28
00:01:42,925 --> 00:01:48,363
Well, let me state the obvious. We can't let
something like this get into his hands.

29
00:01:48,445 --> 00:01:50,515
Or the replicators' hands.

30
00:01:50,605 --> 00:01:54,598
How much time do we have
before Baal's fleet reaches Dakara?

31
00:01:54,685 --> 00:01:55,720
Why?

32
00:01:55,805 --> 00:01:58,524
Baal didn't say exactly
where the device was, did he?

33
00:01:58,605 --> 00:02:00,402
No. He said it was hidden.

34
00:02:00,485 --> 00:02:03,477
Chances are it's in the ruins,
but we can't be sure.

35
00:02:03,565 --> 00:02:07,683
Short of blowing up the planet, we can't
be 100% positive we've destroyed it.

36
00:02:07,765 --> 00:02:12,202
If it's protected by a shield, our biggest
naqahdah-enhanced nuke might not do it.

37
00:02:12,285 --> 00:02:15,402
Fact is, to be sure
we've destroyed the weapon,

38
00:02:15,485 --> 00:02:18,443
we have to find it first.

39
00:02:18,525 --> 00:02:20,516
Go.

40
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:37,275
We've found no evidence of a weapon.

41
00:03:39,725 --> 00:03:42,637
Thanks, guys. We'll take it from here.

42
00:03:42,725 --> 00:03:46,559
But the structure was definitely
built by the Ancients.

43
00:03:46,645 --> 00:03:48,875
As evidenced by the script on this wall.

44
00:03:48,965 --> 00:03:53,800
Until I saw this monument, I did not know
that Dakara was a home of the Ancients.

45
00:03:53,885 --> 00:03:56,763
The Ancient repository
of knowledge on P3X-439

46
00:03:56,845 --> 00:03:58,756
was hidden in a monument like this.

47
00:03:58,845 --> 00:04:02,235
This writing may help us
uncover the location of the weapon.

48
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,919
I was able to recognise the language.

49
00:04:05,005 --> 00:04:07,519
Deciphering it, however,
is another matter.

50
00:04:07,605 --> 00:04:10,199
I brought Daniel's notebooks.

51
00:04:12,805 --> 00:04:17,162
This dialect looks
very old. It may take some time.

52
00:04:17,245 --> 00:04:18,724
I will leave you to it.

53
00:04:30,845 --> 00:04:33,075
We will be outnumbered by Baal's forces.

54
00:04:33,165 --> 00:04:35,725
I refuse to consider a strategy

55
00:04:35,805 --> 00:04:39,081
that demands the deliberate
sacrifice of Jaffa lives.

56
00:04:39,165 --> 00:04:42,077
What, then, do you advocate?
Prayer, perhaps?

57
00:04:42,165 --> 00:04:46,477
Jaffa. We are here
to consider the battle with our enemy.

58
00:04:46,565 --> 00:04:48,556
Not battle each other.

59
00:04:51,285 --> 00:04:54,755
Baal's forces approach at a speed
slower than they are capable.

60
00:04:54,845 --> 00:04:58,804
Indeed. It seems he does wish to give us
time to find and destroy the weapon.

61
00:04:58,885 --> 00:05:00,876
Why not just destroy it himself?

62
00:05:00,965 --> 00:05:03,433
Baal is in a difficult position.

63
00:05:03,525 --> 00:05:07,438
With many witnesses, it is easier to tell
Anubis the weapon was destroyed

64
00:05:07,525 --> 00:05:09,436
before he could reclaim Dakara.

65
00:05:09,525 --> 00:05:11,914
How, then, will he
explain his languid pace?

66
00:05:12,005 --> 00:05:15,395
Regardless, he will only hesitate so long.

67
00:05:15,485 --> 00:05:18,443
Five Ha'tak. Eight Alkesh.

68
00:05:18,525 --> 00:05:22,882
Ten squadrons of gliders.
That is all we have.

69
00:05:22,965 --> 00:05:28,119
Empty the bays. Deploy the gliders
to the far side of the planet.

70
00:05:28,205 --> 00:05:32,198
Position two Ha'tak and all the Alkesh
on the other side of the moon.

71
00:05:32,285 --> 00:05:34,241
Divide our forces?

72
00:05:34,325 --> 00:05:36,680
Precisely.

73
00:05:36,765 --> 00:05:39,996
All of our hardship, the suffering,

74
00:05:40,085 --> 00:05:42,804
the sacrifices
we have made for our cause,

75
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:46,116
will end today one way or another.

76
00:05:47,325 --> 00:05:51,113
This battle will decide the fate of all Jaffa.

77
00:05:59,005 --> 00:06:00,961
This is madness.

78
00:06:01,045 --> 00:06:06,119
So, too, at one time,
was the very thought of our freedom.

79
00:06:13,325 --> 00:06:15,520
So, now what? You done?

80
00:06:15,605 --> 00:06:17,960
You got what you wanted.

81
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:21,879
Don't suppose you wanna just
drop me off at the nearest Stargate?

82
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,877
It is true.
I learned the location of the weapon

83
00:06:24,965 --> 00:06:27,923
that could be a threat
to me and my brethren.

84
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:34,001
But I also saw the extent of knowledge
your subconscious mind contains.

85
00:06:37,325 --> 00:06:39,361
You have no idea, do you?

86
00:06:39,445 --> 00:06:41,401
No.

87
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:42,998
No, I don't.

88
00:06:43,085 --> 00:06:48,398
You've tried accessing it,
but it's always just out of reach, isn't it?

89
00:06:48,485 --> 00:06:50,396
I could help you.

90
00:06:50,485 --> 00:06:56,594
We could unlock the Ancients' knowledge,
the secrets of the universe, together.

91
00:06:57,525 --> 00:07:01,359
I have to admit, it does sound interesting.

92
00:07:03,845 --> 00:07:09,044
But on the other hand, you're
an evil killing machine, so, no. Pass.

93
00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:18,280
No. Don't do this!

94
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:26,841
You had the power. You were about
to strike, but she stopped you.

95
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:30,156
No, I don't believe you.
You can make me see whatever you want.

96
00:07:30,245 --> 00:07:33,317
- That's just a trick.
- You know it's true.

97
00:07:35,485 --> 00:07:38,443
Destroying the weapon
that can destroy me is one thing.

98
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,436
A good thing, for me.

99
00:07:40,525 --> 00:07:43,085
But there is more.

100
00:07:43,165 --> 00:07:46,680
There is a way to kill Anubis in your mind,

101
00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:49,325
and so much more.

102
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:53,282
I am not done, Daniel Jackson.

103
00:07:53,365 --> 00:07:55,481
Far from it.

104
00:07:55,565 --> 00:07:59,194
In fact, we have only just begun.

105
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:08,122
"Midday, the darkness is high in the sky"?

106
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:10,400
You sure about that?

107
00:08:10,485 --> 00:08:14,683
- That is what it says.
- It doesn't make much sense.

108
00:08:14,765 --> 00:08:19,281
Yeah, well, neither does
"the wind blows on the pillow"

109
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:22,323
or "three days to the chicken".

110
00:08:23,205 --> 00:08:26,834
But that's what these phrases
apparently translate into.

111
00:08:26,925 --> 00:08:29,598
Are you saying
this whole wall is nonsense?

112
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:33,473
- I don't know what I'm saying.
- Is it possible you made a mistake?

113
00:08:33,565 --> 00:08:36,762
Would you care to try?

114
00:08:38,925 --> 00:08:44,158
The text is quite difficult, and if there is an
organising principle to Dr Jackson's notes

115
00:08:44,245 --> 00:08:48,682
- I have yet to discover it.
- Yeah. He certainly has his own system.

116
00:08:48,765 --> 00:08:51,757
- Colonel Carter.
- Go ahead, Teal'c.

117
00:08:51,845 --> 00:08:55,599
Have you had any success
with the translation?

118
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:59,041
We're making... some progress.

119
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,958
I am afraid you do not
have much more time.

120
00:09:02,045 --> 00:09:05,799
Our long-range scanners
have detected Baal's fleet.

121
00:09:05,885 --> 00:09:08,604
He will be here within the hour.

122
00:09:08,685 --> 00:09:11,153
Understood.

123
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:19,880
It would be much easier on both of us
if you did not resist.

124
00:09:19,965 --> 00:09:25,676
Why, in the whole wide world of all things
rational and sane, would I help you?

125
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,837
Because deep down you also
want the knowledge I seek.

126
00:09:28,925 --> 00:09:31,837
Yes, but anything I learn
I won't be able to put to use,

127
00:09:31,925 --> 00:09:34,234
because after I'm done, you'll kill me.

128
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:37,203
- What if I promised not to?
- Yeah.

129
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:41,479
Do you think
I am that different from Samantha Carter?

130
00:09:41,565 --> 00:09:44,921
In that you're a replicator
bent on galactic domination

131
00:09:45,005 --> 00:09:47,803
at the expense of all other living things...

132
00:09:47,885 --> 00:09:51,161
Her thoughts, her memories,
even her emotions.

133
00:09:51,245 --> 00:09:54,043
They are not meaningless to me.

134
00:09:54,965 --> 00:09:58,674
I do not wish to harm you,
or destroy Earth, for that matter.

135
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,962
I could have done that already
if I so desired.

136
00:10:02,845 --> 00:10:05,803
You're saying
you'll leave Earth untouched?

137
00:10:05,885 --> 00:10:08,035
I promise you that.

138
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,559
And your life.

139
00:10:13,765 --> 00:10:16,040
Nope, nope. Not gonna help you.

140
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:22,041
But, obviously, I can't do anything
to stop you, so give it your best shot.

141
00:10:27,005 --> 00:10:29,200
What if it's a code?

142
00:10:30,485 --> 00:10:33,283
That can only
be deciphered by someone

143
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:35,959
who understands the language.

144
00:10:37,965 --> 00:10:40,354
Can I see that?

145
00:10:41,445 --> 00:10:44,403
- You're holding it upside down.
- I know. I just noticed.

146
00:10:44,485 --> 00:10:50,162
Upside down, these symbols look
like another word I've seen before.

147
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:56,679
Right side up it's "darkness".
Turn it around, and...

148
00:10:57,325 --> 00:10:59,555
it translates into "sun".

149
00:10:59,645 --> 00:11:02,796
"Midday, the sun is high in the sky."
That makes more sense.

150
00:11:02,885 --> 00:11:05,797
Yeah, but so what?

151
00:11:05,885 --> 00:11:08,718
That's not what the wall says.

152
00:11:43,525 --> 00:11:47,518
- Now it does.
- It can't be that simple.

153
00:11:47,605 --> 00:11:49,800
Just turn all five circles upside down?

154
00:11:49,885 --> 00:11:54,356
No, I agree. It has to be
some sort of combination lock.

155
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:58,438
We just need to figure out
which circles to turn.

156
00:12:00,485 --> 00:12:04,114
Your pathetic trickery
will only delay your inevitable defeat.

157
00:12:04,205 --> 00:12:06,878
There is no trickery at hand.

158
00:12:06,965 --> 00:12:11,277
We know that inevitably your goal
is to eradicate all free Jaffa.

159
00:12:11,365 --> 00:12:14,960
We sent most of our fleet to safety
to survive to fight another day.

160
00:12:15,045 --> 00:12:17,957
Surrender now, or be destroyed.

161
00:12:18,045 --> 00:12:23,039
Defeat those who remain and you'll be
forced to destroy the weapon yourself.

162
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,798
Then you must face Anubis.

163
00:12:27,685 --> 00:12:31,041
His fleet appears to be holding position.

164
00:12:31,845 --> 00:12:34,200
For the moment.

165
00:12:44,285 --> 00:12:46,958
Let's hope that's not a bad sign.

166
00:13:10,085 --> 00:13:12,076
Nice going, Sam.

167
00:13:32,725 --> 00:13:35,239
We're in business.

168
00:13:39,645 --> 00:13:43,558
- It's an Ancient design, sir.
- Think our bomb will do the trick?

169
00:13:43,645 --> 00:13:47,035
We'll soon see.
Give us ten minutes. Carter out.

170
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,160
Right.

171
00:14:10,565 --> 00:14:15,355
Sam? You might wanna hold off
on that for a minute.

172
00:14:18,685 --> 00:14:22,234
If I'm reading this screen right,

173
00:14:22,325 --> 00:14:25,317
the weapon uses an energy wave
to reduce all matter

174
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:27,794
to its basic molecular elements.

175
00:14:27,885 --> 00:14:31,924
It's not strong enough
to disintegrate an entire planet,

176
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:35,281
but it will wash away everything
on a planet's surface,

177
00:14:35,365 --> 00:14:37,595
and anything in the surrounding space.

178
00:14:37,685 --> 00:14:39,676
- That sounds bad.
- I know.

179
00:14:39,765 --> 00:14:42,325
But it also sounds like
it does it much the same way

180
00:14:42,405 --> 00:14:45,715
your disrupter technology
works on the replicators,

181
00:14:45,805 --> 00:14:48,603
by separating the individual components.

182
00:14:48,685 --> 00:14:53,600
They are both Ancient design. O'Neill used
Ancient knowledge to build the disrupter.

183
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,915
I know.

184
00:14:56,005 --> 00:14:59,156
Can this weapon be modified
to work only on the replicators?

185
00:14:59,245 --> 00:15:04,797
I don't know. But I'd hate to blow it up
before I was 100 per cent sure it couldn't.

186
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:10,481
- Teal'c, do you read?
- Proceed, Colonel Carter.

187
00:15:10,565 --> 00:15:15,923
Dad and Selmak think this weapon may
hold the key to defeating the replicators,

188
00:15:16,005 --> 00:15:18,041
and we'll need some time to find out.

189
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,798
Let us know when things get bad
and we'll blow it.

190
00:15:20,885 --> 00:15:23,194
- Understood.
- Carter out.

191
00:15:27,245 --> 00:15:31,443
Baal's fleet just began
moving into attack position.

192
00:15:31,525 --> 00:15:34,358
It appears things are about to get...

193
00:15:34,965 --> 00:15:36,956
bad.

194
00:15:40,725 --> 00:15:43,114
I'm not getting anything.

195
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:48,123
- This may not be possible, you know.
- Come on, Sam.

196
00:15:48,205 --> 00:15:51,083
It can't be any harder
than blowing up a sun.

197
00:15:51,165 --> 00:15:57,115
You blow up one sun and suddenly
everyone expects you to walk on water.

198
00:15:59,605 --> 00:16:01,880
There you go.

199
00:16:01,965 --> 00:16:04,638
Oh. Next up, parting the Red Sea.

200
00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:18,753
Shields are down 50 per cent.

201
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:22,035
We cannot take much more.

202
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:29,561
Signal the other Ha'tak. Begin retreating.
Sublight engines only. Full power.

203
00:16:35,325 --> 00:16:39,238
The rebels are fleeing, my lord.
The planet is ours.

204
00:16:39,325 --> 00:16:44,604
They expect us to follow so that they may
draw the fleet into battle on two fronts.

205
00:16:44,685 --> 00:16:48,394
- Signal the fleet to pursue the shol'va.
- My lord?

206
00:16:48,485 --> 00:16:52,558
Dakara can wait.
No battle strategy can save them now.

207
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:56,001
We will crush them,
and then take the temple.

208
00:16:56,085 --> 00:16:58,599
Yes, my lord.

209
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:04,483
This output is the spectrum of the wave
the weapon uses to disintegrate matter.

210
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:09,320
That's nothing like the spectrum analysis
of the replicator disrupter wave. Look.

211
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:12,602
All we have to do is alter
the settings on the weapon console

212
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:17,156
so that the output wave matches
that of the disrupter technology.

213
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:19,964
- All we have to do?
- Yeah. The device can be set

214
00:17:20,045 --> 00:17:23,242
by varying the height of these panels.

215
00:17:31,525 --> 00:17:36,553
Well, I can run a program to compare
the difference between the two waves.

216
00:17:36,645 --> 00:17:38,795
That's good.

217
00:17:38,885 --> 00:17:42,719
Even if we can make this work,
the replicators were quickly able to adapt

218
00:17:42,805 --> 00:17:46,081
to the modulation Thor made
to the original disrupter wave.

219
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:49,714
- What are you saying?
- The only way to eliminate the replicators

220
00:17:49,805 --> 00:17:54,560
and not allow them to develop immunity is
to somehow hit them all at the same time.

221
00:17:54,645 --> 00:17:57,762
Everywhere in the galaxy?
How are we supposed to do that?

222
00:17:57,845 --> 00:17:59,995
The weapon translates through the gate.

223
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:03,600
Do you think Anubis planned to use it
to attack one planet at a time?

224
00:18:03,685 --> 00:18:06,245
So, dial multiple gates simultaneously?

225
00:18:06,325 --> 00:18:08,793
Not multiple gates. All of them.

226
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:13,275
Every Stargate in the galaxy at one time?

227
00:18:13,365 --> 00:18:16,721
Do you know how many gates
there are in the whole galaxy?

228
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:19,114
A lot.

229
00:18:22,005 --> 00:18:27,204
I have no idea how to alter
a Stargate to perform such a function.

230
00:18:27,285 --> 00:18:30,243
I don't know of anyone who can.

231
00:18:30,325 --> 00:18:32,475
I think I know someone.

232
00:18:33,765 --> 00:18:37,280
- Are you certain, Colonel Carter?
- I don't think we have a choice.

233
00:18:37,365 --> 00:18:41,643
I mean, this could be
the best chance we'll ever get.

234
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,156
Understood.

235
00:18:47,565 --> 00:18:49,442
Opening a channel.

236
00:18:51,805 --> 00:18:56,560
You have decided to surrender. A wise
decision, given you face imminent defeat.

237
00:18:56,645 --> 00:19:00,194
We have no intention of surrendering.
I merely wish to inform you

238
00:19:00,285 --> 00:19:03,914
that we have found
the Ancient weapon on Dakara.

239
00:19:04,005 --> 00:19:05,996
Do you intend to destroy it?

240
00:19:06,085 --> 00:19:08,599
That would be foolish.

241
00:19:08,685 --> 00:19:14,920
The Ancient weapon may be the means
to destroy the replicators once and for all.

242
00:19:23,485 --> 00:19:25,521
It's incredible,

243
00:19:25,605 --> 00:19:27,641
yet you still resist me.

244
00:19:27,725 --> 00:19:29,955
Are you not amazed
by what you are seeing?

245
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:35,073
I don't understand it. It's more than
any human can begin to comprehend.

246
00:19:35,165 --> 00:19:38,362
- I am not human.
- Oh, believe me, I know.

247
00:19:39,165 --> 00:19:42,714
There must be a limit to how much
information your mind can store.

248
00:19:42,805 --> 00:19:45,956
I am sharing what I learn
with my brethren.

249
00:19:46,045 --> 00:19:50,402
The extent of knowledge we can absorb
is only limited by our numbers.

250
00:19:50,485 --> 00:19:56,082
As we speak, those numbers are growing
faster than you can imagine.

251
00:20:05,445 --> 00:20:10,838
This chamber must be well shielded.
I could not find it using my ship's sensors.

252
00:20:10,925 --> 00:20:13,962
Look, I assume Teal'c told you the plan.

253
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:17,958
What makes you think you can modify
this weapon to defeat replicators?

254
00:20:18,045 --> 00:20:20,718
We're already on our way to doing that.

255
00:20:20,805 --> 00:20:23,683
We need to get this weapon's wave output

256
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:28,600
to match our modified replicator disrupter
wave to within a margin of 0.76 per cent.

257
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:32,883
How did you develop this replicator
disrupter technology in the first place?

258
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:37,356
General O'Neill built it using Ancient
knowledge and an Asgard computer.

259
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,003
O'Neill?

260
00:20:39,085 --> 00:20:42,475
The mere thought of that makes me sick.

261
00:20:43,165 --> 00:20:48,193
Look, if we can do this and somehow
hit the replicators all at the same time,

262
00:20:48,285 --> 00:20:51,322
we think it will work,
but we need your help.

263
00:20:51,405 --> 00:20:53,760
You want me to reprogram a Stargate

264
00:20:53,845 --> 00:20:56,439
to dial every gate in the galaxy
simultaneously.

265
00:20:56,525 --> 00:20:58,675
I know you used
the gate's update program

266
00:20:58,765 --> 00:21:01,916
to disseminate a dialling virus
to the entire gate network.

267
00:21:02,005 --> 00:21:06,556
With a virus you initially planted
in my Stargate.

268
00:21:06,645 --> 00:21:09,796
No one's trying to deny
that we're mortal enemies here.

269
00:21:09,885 --> 00:21:12,035
Can you do it or not?

270
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:18,917
I can't believe I'm considering cooperating
with a female of the Tauri, and a Tok'ra.

271
00:21:19,005 --> 00:21:22,475
This was not my idea,
believe me.

272
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:26,638
- I'll instruct my troops to land.
- No way.

273
00:21:26,725 --> 00:21:29,398
You send one Jaffa down here
and the deal's off.

274
00:21:29,485 --> 00:21:32,363
I cannot do what you ask
as a hologram transmission.

275
00:21:32,445 --> 00:21:35,278
Sure you can. Just tell me what to do.

276
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,678
Unscheduled offworld activation!

277
00:21:40,765 --> 00:21:43,723
- Is that Carter?
- No, sir. It's a radio signal.

278
00:21:43,805 --> 00:21:45,682
Put it on speaker.

279
00:21:49,405 --> 00:21:51,999
- Sergeant?
- I don't know, sir.

280
00:21:55,245 --> 00:21:58,282
- What the hell is that?
- I'm not sure, sir.

281
00:21:58,365 --> 00:22:03,155
I can't access the system. It looks like
something's hacked into the computer.

282
00:22:03,245 --> 00:22:06,681
- Shut it down.
- I can't, sir. I'm locked out.

283
00:22:06,765 --> 00:22:08,756
Damn.

284
00:22:10,365 --> 00:22:12,720
This is General O'Neill.

285
00:22:14,045 --> 00:22:16,001
Sir!

286
00:22:26,885 --> 00:22:30,275
Evacuate the gate room! Get outta there!

287
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:39,355
Close the blast doors.

288
00:22:45,085 --> 00:22:47,645
Initiate base lockdown.

289
00:22:47,725 --> 00:22:50,922
Evacuation of all personnel
through alternate routes.

290
00:22:51,005 --> 00:22:54,281
Self-destruct protocol on my order.

291
00:22:54,365 --> 00:22:57,516
Let's go, Walter. Let's get outta here.

292
00:23:10,045 --> 00:23:12,798
- Oh, man.
- Sir.

293
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:16,915
We're cut off from the self-destruct.
They were too fast.

294
00:23:17,005 --> 00:23:20,759
There's a chance they've already
disabled the activation mechanism.

295
00:23:20,845 --> 00:23:23,723
Those bugs cannot
get outta this mountain.

296
00:23:23,805 --> 00:23:27,798
It's only a matter of time before
they override the security doors.

297
00:23:27,885 --> 00:23:31,844
Make sure everybody's outta here,
then we'll toss a nuke down the silo.

298
00:23:31,925 --> 00:23:35,520
- You think that'll stop 'em?
- It should slow 'em down.

299
00:23:42,885 --> 00:23:45,194
You can't handle it, can you?

300
00:23:45,285 --> 00:23:47,082
I can.

301
00:23:47,165 --> 00:23:50,521
I just need time to process,
share it with the others.

302
00:23:50,605 --> 00:23:54,564
Like the universe, it's infinite.
It's not just knowledge and information.

303
00:23:54,645 --> 00:23:57,842
It's understanding
on a level that you'll never reach.

304
00:23:57,925 --> 00:24:01,315
- Why do you think that?
- Because you're a machine.

305
00:24:01,405 --> 00:24:04,636
So are you, just of weaker construction.

306
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:09,364
- And that's where you're wrong.
- We'll see.

307
00:24:12,085 --> 00:24:17,318
The president has authorised
deployment ofa ten-kiloton nuclear bomb.

308
00:24:17,405 --> 00:24:23,321
A 200-square-mile radius around
Cheyenne Mountain is being evacuated.

309
00:24:23,405 --> 00:24:28,877
A helicopter is waiting on the surface
for you and the remaining personnel.

310
00:24:28,965 --> 00:24:31,604
Thank you, Walter.

311
00:24:32,485 --> 00:24:33,554
Colonel?

312
00:24:33,645 --> 00:24:37,194
We have a problem. Six SGC personnel
are trapped on level eight.

313
00:24:37,285 --> 00:24:39,958
They're cut off from
the emergency escape hatch.

314
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,081
- Siler?
- Siler.

315
00:24:43,725 --> 00:24:45,443
Oh, Siler.

316
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,402
Let's go.

317
00:24:54,605 --> 00:24:57,073
- You lied to me.
- What?

318
00:24:57,165 --> 00:25:01,681
You promised you'd leave Earth alone.
There's replicators infiltrating the SGC.

319
00:25:01,765 --> 00:25:04,279
How can you know that?

320
00:25:06,565 --> 00:25:09,079
While I was in your mind,
you were inside mine.

321
00:25:09,165 --> 00:25:12,316
Took a while to figure out.
You were too distracted to notice.

322
00:25:12,405 --> 00:25:14,839
The Ancient knowledge helped too.
Thank you.

323
00:25:14,925 --> 00:25:18,122
- You tricked me.
- You tricked me first.

324
00:25:18,205 --> 00:25:21,117
- You should never have told me.
- Too late.

325
00:25:21,205 --> 00:25:23,116
For you, that is.

326
00:25:25,485 --> 00:25:29,194
Trying to leave? Sorry.
A little more time in Danny's world.

327
00:25:29,285 --> 00:25:33,676
My brethren will not stop.
You cannot control them.

328
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:35,244
Not yet,

329
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,839
but I'm learning.

330
00:25:48,205 --> 00:25:51,720
We've rigged the DHD to dial
on signal when the weapon's ready.

331
00:25:51,805 --> 00:25:55,354
- I think it should work.
- Of course it will work.

332
00:25:55,445 --> 00:25:58,482
How dare you doubt me?

333
00:25:58,565 --> 00:26:02,080
- What's he still doing here?
- I can't exactly ask him to leave.

334
00:26:02,165 --> 00:26:04,440
How's it going on your end?

335
00:26:04,525 --> 00:26:06,322
I'm getting closer.

336
00:26:06,405 --> 00:26:08,965
This one.

337
00:26:09,885 --> 00:26:13,480
- How do you know?
- I am a god.

338
00:26:13,565 --> 00:26:16,204
Gods are all-knowing.

339
00:26:17,485 --> 00:26:19,635
Selmak can't work like this.

340
00:26:20,405 --> 00:26:23,078
- Neither can I.
- Just try it.

341
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:43,084
Lucky guess.

342
00:27:01,845 --> 00:27:04,678
- Siler, are you in there?
- Yes, sir.

343
00:27:04,765 --> 00:27:07,484
We'll get you out.
Step away from the blast door.

344
00:27:07,565 --> 00:27:09,078
Yes, sir.

345
00:27:09,165 --> 00:27:11,360
Get this table over.

346
00:27:16,325 --> 00:27:19,283
- Use two of those things.
- Sir?

347
00:27:19,365 --> 00:27:22,198
It's a blast door.

348
00:27:31,885 --> 00:27:33,876
Hang on, Siler.

349
00:27:39,005 --> 00:27:40,996
Fire in the hole.

350
00:27:41,085 --> 00:27:42,962
Down!

351
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:55,320
Whoa.

352
00:27:55,405 --> 00:27:57,396
Siler?

353
00:27:57,485 --> 00:28:00,761
- Thank you, sir.
- I expect to be put in your will.

354
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:04,963
- Already in it, sir.
- OK, that's weird.

355
00:28:16,165 --> 00:28:18,156
Oh, crap.

356
00:28:32,765 --> 00:28:37,759
Sensors are picking up
multiple ships exiting hyperspace.

357
00:28:45,405 --> 00:28:48,363
They're firing on Baal's forces.

358
00:28:51,805 --> 00:28:54,273
It is the replicators.

359
00:28:55,405 --> 00:28:57,839
Now this one.

360
00:29:05,085 --> 00:29:07,394
That one took us in the wrong direction.

361
00:29:07,485 --> 00:29:09,794
All-knowing, huh?

362
00:29:11,925 --> 00:29:14,359
- What's the matter?
- My ships are under attack.

363
00:29:14,445 --> 00:29:17,721
A replicator-controlled fleet
is encroaching on the planet.

364
00:29:28,765 --> 00:29:31,757
- Running low on ammo, sir.
- Fall back!

365
00:29:39,525 --> 00:29:43,154
Instruct all of our vessels
to target the replicator ships.

366
00:29:43,245 --> 00:29:45,361
Better to let them destroy each other.

367
00:29:45,445 --> 00:29:49,279
If the replicators prevail
and gain control of the weapon on Dakara,

368
00:29:49,365 --> 00:29:52,402
all that we have fought for is lost.

369
00:29:56,285 --> 00:29:59,243
General, 15 minutes
to safe detonation conditions.

370
00:29:59,325 --> 00:30:02,078
Yeah. You know, Walter,
right now we're having

371
00:30:02,165 --> 00:30:05,157
a slightly difficult time getting outta here.

372
00:30:05,245 --> 00:30:08,043
Relay this to General Hammond.

373
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:11,276
The second he can pull the trigger
on that nuke, do it.

374
00:30:11,365 --> 00:30:13,833
- Do you read?
- Yes, sir.

375
00:30:13,925 --> 00:30:17,042
And have that chopper
that's waiting for us leave now.

376
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:19,116
- Yes, sir.
- Sir?

377
00:30:21,565 --> 00:30:24,602
You see those bugs going into that hatch?

378
00:30:24,685 --> 00:30:27,757
Yes. Think getting outta the base
is their primary goal?

379
00:30:27,845 --> 00:30:31,201
It's a fairly safe bet.
They're going to the surface.

380
00:30:31,285 --> 00:30:34,322
Leaving the only other way
outta here accessible.

381
00:30:35,045 --> 00:30:37,161
And here.

382
00:30:42,205 --> 00:30:44,161
1.32. We're almost there.

383
00:30:47,605 --> 00:30:52,633
My ship has lost life support on several
levels. I cannot maintain my transmission.

384
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:56,240
We've almost got it. Thanks for the help.

385
00:30:56,325 --> 00:30:58,316
Good luck.

386
00:30:59,565 --> 00:31:02,557
- That was just creepy.
- Keep working.

387
00:31:37,045 --> 00:31:39,036
Go.

388
00:31:55,485 --> 00:31:57,476
Siler, can we dial out?

389
00:31:57,565 --> 00:32:02,161
- I'm working on it, sir.
- Ten minutes to detonation.

390
00:32:11,005 --> 00:32:14,042
Shields down. Weapons systems offline.

391
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:18,721
Reroute power to sublight engines.
Evasive manoeuvres.

392
00:32:23,605 --> 00:32:26,995
They are too fast. We cannot evade them.

393
00:32:39,685 --> 00:32:41,801
- How's it going in there?
- Not well.

394
00:32:41,885 --> 00:32:44,319
Same here.

395
00:32:46,085 --> 00:32:48,121
Grenade!

396
00:33:08,645 --> 00:33:10,954
Variable off by 0.98.

397
00:33:11,045 --> 00:33:13,718
What's that?

398
00:33:14,245 --> 00:33:17,203
- Hurry.
- I've almost got it. Just a little more time.

399
00:33:17,285 --> 00:33:19,799
I don't think we have it.

400
00:33:38,965 --> 00:33:40,318
Siler!

401
00:33:40,965 --> 00:33:43,195
Sorry, sir, I'm trying.

402
00:33:51,005 --> 00:33:53,280
Got you now.

403
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:01,599
Huh.

404
00:34:02,925 --> 00:34:04,677
That's odd.

405
00:34:08,205 --> 00:34:11,197
The replicator ship just... stopped.

406
00:34:12,045 --> 00:34:18,041
Sensors are indicating that all of
the replicator ships have ceased activity.

407
00:34:20,965 --> 00:34:24,958
Colonel Carter. Have you
successfully activated the weapon?

408
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:32,882
Not yet, but the replicators
down here just froze.

409
00:34:33,485 --> 00:34:35,680
- Dad?
- Almost there.

410
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:45,555
There are so many, aren't there?
Too many for your mind to handle.

411
00:34:45,645 --> 00:34:50,639
It's taking all of your concentration
just to control them.

412
00:35:22,565 --> 00:35:25,079
Well, that was too good to last.

413
00:35:31,885 --> 00:35:34,763
Dad, they're on the move again!

414
00:35:36,045 --> 00:35:38,605
- 0.76.
- Do it!

415
00:36:15,885 --> 00:36:17,841
Incoming wormhole?

416
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:38,674
Enemy ship is in range.
It is powering weapons.

417
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:41,923
We cannot survive another hit.

418
00:37:58,365 --> 00:38:01,277
- Dad.
- I'm all right.

419
00:38:01,365 --> 00:38:04,163
- What happened?
- I don't know.

420
00:38:05,765 --> 00:38:09,440
- You did it.
- Well, Selmak deserves a little credit.

421
00:38:10,605 --> 00:38:12,641
OK.

422
00:38:12,725 --> 00:38:15,285
Most of it.

423
00:38:18,485 --> 00:38:21,636
All replicator-controlled ships
are dormant.

424
00:38:21,725 --> 00:38:25,718
Prepare enough squads to board them.
Reclaim them in the name of their god.

425
00:38:25,805 --> 00:38:28,478
Yes, my lord.

426
00:38:28,565 --> 00:38:31,602
- We are being hailed.
- On screen.

427
00:38:32,205 --> 00:38:35,800
Surrender now
and you will be granted mercy.

428
00:38:35,885 --> 00:38:40,163
You are hardly in any position
to be making such ridiculous demands.

429
00:38:40,245 --> 00:38:43,123
- You are surrounded.
- You are incorrect.

430
00:38:43,205 --> 00:38:46,675
It is, in fact, you that is
surrounded by free Jaffa.

431
00:38:56,565 --> 00:38:59,477
Behold your false god.

432
00:39:24,165 --> 00:39:26,520
- Any more word from Teal'c?
- Yes, sir.

433
00:39:26,605 --> 00:39:29,073
Although Baal got away,
the fact he turned tail

434
00:39:29,165 --> 00:39:33,124
made the victory the turning point
Teal'c and Bra'tac were hoping for.

435
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:35,639
Jaffa from all over the galaxy
are with them.

436
00:39:35,725 --> 00:39:38,603
Well, vive la révolution.

437
00:39:38,685 --> 00:39:41,245
A significant fleet is securing Dakara.

438
00:39:41,325 --> 00:39:46,274
Hopefully, with our weapons, they can
turn the tide against Anubis' soldiers.

439
00:39:46,365 --> 00:39:51,075
It looks like the Jaffa
might finally win their freedom.

440
00:39:51,165 --> 00:39:53,440
- It's about time.
- Yes, sir.

441
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:55,595
- I heard from Thor.
- How's he doing?

442
00:39:55,685 --> 00:40:00,361
Great. He sends us all his congratulations
and says that he will drop by for a visit

443
00:40:00,445 --> 00:40:05,519
as soon as his consciousness
has been downloaded into a new body.

444
00:40:05,605 --> 00:40:10,042
- That just never gets old, does it?
- Apparently not.

445
00:40:12,525 --> 00:40:17,724
Carter, did you notice if the replicators
where you were happened to...

446
00:40:17,805 --> 00:40:20,114
stop in the middle of everything?

447
00:40:20,205 --> 00:40:23,834
- Yeah. It was really strange. They just...
- Froze.

448
00:40:23,925 --> 00:40:26,359
It bought us time to calibrate the weapon.

449
00:40:26,445 --> 00:40:28,561
Any idea why that happened?

450
00:40:30,325 --> 00:40:33,078
You think Daniel
had something to do with it?

451
00:40:33,165 --> 00:40:36,316
- I don't know.
- If he was on board that replicator ship...

452
00:40:36,405 --> 00:40:37,838
Carter.

453
00:40:37,925 --> 00:40:40,962
We don't know anything.

454
00:40:41,045 --> 00:40:43,036
No, sir.

455
00:40:44,885 --> 00:40:47,353
Anything else?

456
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,436
No, sir.

457
00:41:38,045 --> 00:41:41,117
