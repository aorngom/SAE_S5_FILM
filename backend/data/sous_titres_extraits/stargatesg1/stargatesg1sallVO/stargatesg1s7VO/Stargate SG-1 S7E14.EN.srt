1
00:00:10,967 --> 00:00:15,438
- Receiving a signal. It's the Kelownans.
- Open the iris.

2
00:00:25,407 --> 00:00:29,798
- Mr Quinn. It's good to see you again.
- It's good to see you too, sir.

3
00:00:29,887 --> 00:00:33,846
I only wish it was
under better circumstances.

4
00:00:35,207 --> 00:00:37,004
We need to talk.

5
00:00:38,087 --> 00:00:43,844
For several months we've been analysing
data on the crystal left behind by Thanos.

6
00:00:43,927 --> 00:00:48,284
It was the Goa'uld
that occupied our planet 3,000 years ago.

7
00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:55,557
Our progress at first was slow, but we
recently made a major, major discovery.

8
00:00:57,127 --> 00:01:02,520
It turns out that naquadria
was not originally present.

9
00:01:03,287 --> 00:01:05,084
- Here.
- What do you mean?

10
00:01:05,647 --> 00:01:07,763
It's not native to our planet.

11
00:01:07,847 --> 00:01:10,759
It exists
in the mineral deposits underground.

12
00:01:10,847 --> 00:01:12,565
I know it does now,

13
00:01:12,647 --> 00:01:17,960
but we believe that those deposits were
originally made up of ordinary naqahdah.

14
00:01:18,047 --> 00:01:22,563
- I assume this makes sense to you.
- Actually, no, it doesn't.

15
00:01:22,647 --> 00:01:25,764
We found a reference
to a process the Goa'uld discovered

16
00:01:25,847 --> 00:01:29,999
which let them convert raw naqahdah into
naquadria while it's still in the ground.

17
00:01:30,087 --> 00:01:35,400
It started a chain reaction which has
continued on down through the veins,

18
00:01:35,487 --> 00:01:39,526
getting deeper and deeper,
and we believe the process is ongoing.

19
00:01:39,607 --> 00:01:43,282
Are you saying that right now there are
deposits of naqahdah on your planet

20
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:45,358
being transformed into naquadria?

21
00:01:45,447 --> 00:01:48,723
Yes. One very large one in particular.

22
00:01:48,807 --> 00:01:53,164
We only recently discovered it
because it's so far beneath the surface.

23
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:57,604
But as the conversion process goes
deeper, the heat and pressure get higher.

24
00:01:57,687 --> 00:01:59,723
And naquadria is highly unstable.

25
00:01:59,807 --> 00:02:03,959
We believe that when it reaches
a certain depth, it's going to explode.

26
00:02:04,047 --> 00:02:06,242
With enough force to obliterate Kelowna.

27
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:29,885
The first few references to the conversion
process that we found were pretty vague.

28
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:33,562
I was half-convinced
I'd made a mistake in the translation.

29
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:36,286
Then we came across test results

30
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:42,681
which show the ratio of naqahdah
to naquadria achieved in the process.

31
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:44,758
Check this out.

32
00:03:46,607 --> 00:03:49,838
The unconverted naqahdah
breaks down into lighter elements.

33
00:03:49,927 --> 00:03:55,604
I was wondering why we never found any
naquadria anywhere else in the galaxy.

34
00:03:55,687 --> 00:03:58,565
Now I think it's because
it doesn't exist in nature at all.

35
00:03:58,647 --> 00:04:03,641
That's why none of the Goa'uld knew
about it until Anubis probed your mind.

36
00:04:03,727 --> 00:04:07,481
We've got the latest geological data.
It looks like...

37
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:11,116
- Oh. Hello.
- Hi.

38
00:04:12,327 --> 00:04:17,321
Oh... Samantha Carter, this is
Kianna Cyr. This is... Sam Carter.

39
00:04:17,407 --> 00:04:20,797
- She helps me out on the translations.
- I've heard a lot about you.

40
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:23,959
- We could use your expertise right now.
- What you got?

41
00:04:24,047 --> 00:04:27,198
The naquadria has progressed
deeper than we thought.

42
00:04:27,287 --> 00:04:31,166
- How much time do we have?
- A few weeks, a month. It's hard to say.

43
00:04:31,247 --> 00:04:35,559
We must understand how the conversion
process works if we want to stop it.

44
00:04:35,647 --> 00:04:38,559
Yeah, but the information
on the crystal's incomplete.

45
00:04:38,647 --> 00:04:42,526
Then we're gonna have
to figure it out for ourselves.

46
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:56,446
Ambassador, welcome to Earth.

47
00:04:56,527 --> 00:04:59,758
- Actually, it's First Minister now.
- First Minister.

48
00:05:00,727 --> 00:05:03,116
This is Vin Eremal and Lucia Tarthus,

49
00:05:03,207 --> 00:05:05,880
the Tiranian and Andari representatives
on the council.

50
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:07,958
Councillors.

51
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:10,798
Right this way.

52
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:19,326
I assumed Jonas Quinn
would be joining us.

53
00:05:19,407 --> 00:05:23,923
He sends his apologies. He's devoting
his attention to the naquadria problem.

54
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:26,316
Has any progress been made?

55
00:05:26,407 --> 00:05:28,682
So far very little, I'm afraid.

56
00:05:28,767 --> 00:05:31,645
I believe that with the participation
of our friends from Earth,

57
00:05:31,727 --> 00:05:33,319
a solution will be found.

58
00:05:33,407 --> 00:05:38,561
We all hope that's the case, but you may
want to consider some contingency plans.

59
00:05:38,647 --> 00:05:41,605
We can offer you limited relocation
through the Stargate.

60
00:05:41,687 --> 00:05:43,086
Limited?

61
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:47,046
A full evacuation of an industrialised
world is a practical impossibility.

62
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:49,917
I'm not sure I understand.

63
00:05:50,007 --> 00:05:54,842
You invited us here
to propose that we abandon Langara?

64
00:05:56,207 --> 00:05:58,243
Langara is the new name of our planet.

65
00:05:58,927 --> 00:06:01,680
It's from an ancient dialect
common to all three nations.

66
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:03,758
A symbol of our new unity.

67
00:06:04,767 --> 00:06:08,601
- Has a nice ring to it.
- It was chosen by a committee.

68
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:11,121
We understand
that if this problem cannot be solved,

69
00:06:11,207 --> 00:06:13,198
Kelowna will suffer severe devastation.

70
00:06:13,287 --> 00:06:16,757
At which point we are prepared
to offer the survivors humanitarian aid.

71
00:06:16,847 --> 00:06:20,726
We have limited resources,
but we pledge to do what we can.

72
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:25,362
- Are you kidding?
- Has no one explained this to you?

73
00:06:25,447 --> 00:06:28,439
We have tried.
They seem unwilling to accept the truth.

74
00:06:28,527 --> 00:06:30,245
If you knew our history,

75
00:06:30,327 --> 00:06:33,399
you'd understand our reluctance
to believe Kelownan propaganda.

76
00:06:33,487 --> 00:06:35,842
Our own scientists
have studied the problem.

77
00:06:35,927 --> 00:06:38,236
While Kelowna
will bear the brunt of the explosion -

78
00:06:38,327 --> 00:06:41,922
in fact, almost half the country's
landmass will be destroyed -

79
00:06:42,007 --> 00:06:45,443
you're not taking into account
the debris in the upper atmosphere.

80
00:06:45,527 --> 00:06:49,679
It will block the sunlight and lower the
average surface temperature significantly.

81
00:06:50,287 --> 00:06:53,757
Your entire planet will be uninhabitable.

82
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:06,402
It makes no sense. Naquadria is a heavier,
less stable isotope than naqahdah.

83
00:07:06,487 --> 00:07:09,763
Conversion should require
the continuous input of energy.

84
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:12,441
But it seems to be continuing on its own.

85
00:07:12,527 --> 00:07:15,519
- Which is impossible.
- Not necessarily.

86
00:07:15,607 --> 00:07:20,806
Low-energy fusion can occur in the
presence of certain catalysts like muons.

87
00:07:20,887 --> 00:07:24,846
I believe that only works for extremely
light materials such as deuterium.

88
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:29,079
Kelownan understanding of particle
physics seems to have come a long way.

89
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:31,158
We're quick learners.

90
00:07:31,247 --> 00:07:33,886
I wasn't thinking
about muons specifically.

91
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:37,846
Other subatomic particles
could have catalysed this reaction.

92
00:07:37,927 --> 00:07:42,205
The real question is why didn't this planet
blow up a long time ago?

93
00:07:42,287 --> 00:07:43,481
What do you mean?

94
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:45,558
You haven't figured out the process

95
00:07:45,647 --> 00:07:50,038
because you've assumed that this
transformation began 3,000 years ago.

96
00:07:50,127 --> 00:07:53,437
- That's what the historical data indicates.
- Maybe so.

97
00:07:53,527 --> 00:07:56,883
If you put that aside and assume
the presence of the right catalysts,

98
00:07:56,967 --> 00:07:59,003
you can account for this reaction.

99
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:02,523
- It's just a lot faster than you thought.
- How much faster?

100
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,121
A deposit
the size of the one you discovered

101
00:08:05,207 --> 00:08:08,995
could take as little as a few years
to transform completely.

102
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:29,758
What was that?

103
00:08:33,087 --> 00:08:36,159
Receiving video transmission, sir.

104
00:08:37,207 --> 00:08:39,198
Major, what's your situation?

105
00:08:39,287 --> 00:08:42,563
Most of the fires caused
by the earthquake are under control.

106
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,798
Dr Fraiser's organising
the distribution of medical supplies.

107
00:08:45,887 --> 00:08:49,516
- It's hard to believe it was a coincidence.
- It wasn't.

108
00:08:49,607 --> 00:08:52,917
We traced the epicentre
to a small pocket of converted naquadria

109
00:08:53,007 --> 00:08:55,123
located about 20km below the surface.

110
00:08:55,207 --> 00:08:56,606
A small pocket?

111
00:08:56,687 --> 00:09:02,319
When the main deposit goes, the
explosion will be 100,000 times greater.

112
00:09:06,407 --> 00:09:08,602
- This planet?
- Madronas.

113
00:09:08,687 --> 00:09:12,441
- And how far away is it?
- Approximately 14,000 light years.

114
00:09:14,407 --> 00:09:16,045
Give or take.

115
00:09:16,127 --> 00:09:18,516
The Madronans
are a peaceful, advanced society

116
00:09:18,607 --> 00:09:21,167
with resources
to accept thousands of refugees.

117
00:09:21,247 --> 00:09:25,923
Quinn's reports refer to uninhabited
planets capable of sustaining life.

118
00:09:26,007 --> 00:09:29,397
The Andari government might consider
relocation if one were available.

119
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:32,365
Without infrastructure,
any uninhabited planet

120
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:35,245
would not be able to sustain
as many Langaran refugees.

121
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:38,046
I'm not suggesting one planet for all of us.

122
00:09:38,887 --> 00:09:40,684
You want your own planet?

123
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:44,999
The Andari people would welcome a fresh
start, given the oppression we've suffered.

124
00:09:45,087 --> 00:09:48,557
All you suffered under Tiranian rule
was peace and good government!

125
00:09:48,647 --> 00:09:51,002
And mass arrests, summary executions!

126
00:09:51,087 --> 00:09:54,966
- In response to terrorist acts!
- Whoa!

127
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:58,635
We're getting a bit off-topic here.

128
00:09:59,607 --> 00:10:02,883
Three separate relocations
is just not practical.

129
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:05,879
Madronas is your best bet
to save as many lives as possible.

130
00:10:19,407 --> 00:10:21,637
Jonas. Major Carter.

131
00:10:21,727 --> 00:10:24,480
You've discovered something
about the conversion process.

132
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:30,319
We determined that the transformation
must have begun

133
00:10:30,407 --> 00:10:33,365
with a massive bombardment
of subatomic particles

134
00:10:33,447 --> 00:10:36,883
which catalyse the reaction and allow it
to continue without energy input.

135
00:10:37,607 --> 00:10:40,599
It's possible
to create these particles in the lab.

136
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:43,759
But there's only one way
they could have been produced

137
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:47,203
with enough energy to penetrate
several miles into the crust of the planet.

138
00:10:47,287 --> 00:10:49,755
It was the naquadria bomb test.

139
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:53,035
The test
that was conducted two years ago.

140
00:10:54,327 --> 00:10:56,443
We did this to ourselves.

141
00:11:06,607 --> 00:11:10,725
Historical documents indicate that Thanos
was destroyed in some cataclysmic event.

142
00:11:10,807 --> 00:11:13,605
Maybe this explosion
triggered the chain reaction.

143
00:11:13,687 --> 00:11:16,884
It did. At least with the naqahdah deposit
near the surface.

144
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:23,361
Thanos managed to create naquadria
in the lab, but something went wrong.

145
00:11:23,447 --> 00:11:27,042
The resulting explosion
released the subatomic particles

146
00:11:27,127 --> 00:11:29,960
which catalysed the conversion
of the first vein of naqahdah.

147
00:11:30,047 --> 00:11:32,766
The rest of the deposit
transformed in less than a year.

148
00:11:32,847 --> 00:11:34,963
After that it lay in the ground.

149
00:11:35,047 --> 00:11:38,357
Another 10,000 years and it would have
decayed back into naqahdah -

150
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,438
if you hadn't mined it first.

151
00:11:40,527 --> 00:11:46,238
Then we set off the bomb, which started
the conversion of the second, deeper vein.

152
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,118
This is outrageous.

153
00:11:53,207 --> 00:11:57,200
If what you say is true, the Kelownan
government bears full responsibility

154
00:11:57,287 --> 00:11:59,278
for the imminent destruction of Langara.

155
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:02,325
Your governments formed an alliance
to attack Kelowna.

156
00:12:02,407 --> 00:12:04,398
We were looking to defend ourselves.

157
00:12:04,487 --> 00:12:07,638
We went to a heightened war alert
after we learned of your research.

158
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:11,515
- Which proves you were spying on us.
- What choice did we have?

159
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:14,804
We weren't going to rely on the
Kelownan government to tell us the truth.

160
00:12:14,887 --> 00:12:16,286
Councillors, please.

161
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:19,325
These talks must be suspended
until I confer with my cabinet.

162
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:21,875
- For crying out loud!
- Jack.

163
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:23,958
Who cares whose fault it is?

164
00:12:24,047 --> 00:12:27,164
Your planet is gonna blow up.
The whole damn planet, Daniel!

165
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,886
I think it's best if we all take a little recess.

166
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:37,355
General.

167
00:12:37,447 --> 00:12:39,438
- I say we send 'em packing.
- Indeed.

168
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:42,166
We still have the potential
to save thousands of lives.

169
00:12:42,247 --> 00:12:45,000
And yet
they don't seem to understand or care.

170
00:12:45,087 --> 00:12:48,523
This is diplomacy, the way
the game is played. It takes patience.

171
00:12:48,607 --> 00:12:51,167
Yeah? Well, I'm fresh out.

172
00:12:51,247 --> 00:12:53,238
As am I.

173
00:12:55,047 --> 00:12:57,242
I think you're on your own.

174
00:13:08,047 --> 00:13:11,323
However many times you go over this,
we'll come to the same conclusion.

175
00:13:11,407 --> 00:13:14,683
There is simply no way
to reverse the process.

176
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:16,962
Maybe we don't have to.

177
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:19,436
According to the latest geological data,

178
00:13:19,527 --> 00:13:22,280
there's a minor fault line
crossing the vein of naqahdah

179
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:24,835
about a kilometre above the large deposit.

180
00:13:24,927 --> 00:13:28,283
If we could somehow
trigger a move along the fault line,

181
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:32,565
we could isolate the advancing naquadria
and break off the chain reaction.

182
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:36,284
- How do we do that?
- Set off a large explosion near the fault.

183
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:40,042
Stargate Command
could provide a small nuclear device.

184
00:13:40,127 --> 00:13:42,846
The only problem is
we'd have to get it down there,

185
00:13:42,927 --> 00:13:46,158
which means drilling
through 20 kilometres of solid rock.

186
00:13:50,127 --> 00:13:54,359
- What?
- There's something I wanna show you.

187
00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:20,638
It took us 2½ years to build,

188
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:24,083
at a cost of over half
the annual Kelownan research budget.

189
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:28,837
A deep-underground excavation vehicle.

190
00:14:30,847 --> 00:14:31,916
Cool.

191
00:14:35,327 --> 00:14:41,766
The fore and aft sections have both
been outfitted with titanium cutter heads,

192
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:47,604
each of which can withstand or apply
thrusts of up to 50 metric tonnes.

193
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:51,042
What kind of advance rate?

194
00:14:51,127 --> 00:14:54,199
Uh... about 80 metres per hour.

195
00:14:55,207 --> 00:15:00,076
I know it's not fast enough, but I do have
an idea for a little adjustment

196
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:02,761
that'll give us a lot more speed.

197
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:04,838
Tok'ra tunnel crystals.

198
00:15:04,927 --> 00:15:07,964
Modified to work
in conjunction with the cutter heads.

199
00:15:08,047 --> 00:15:10,959
Pretty impressive.
Mind if I look at your power systems?

200
00:15:11,047 --> 00:15:13,515
After you.

201
00:15:19,447 --> 00:15:22,757
- Do we have to show her everything?
- Kianna.

202
00:15:22,847 --> 00:15:24,838
Everybody has an agenda, Jonas.

203
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:28,522
Her people have made no secret
of their interest in our naquadria deposits.

204
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:31,519
Look, I've wanted to come forward
with this for a long time,

205
00:15:31,607 --> 00:15:34,121
but I always got overruled by the cabinet.

206
00:15:34,207 --> 00:15:37,517
- Now we have no choice.
- We don't need her.

207
00:15:37,607 --> 00:15:40,440
We can go to the Tok'ra ourselves.

208
00:15:40,527 --> 00:15:44,122
I worked with these people
for over a year.

209
00:15:44,207 --> 00:15:46,926
I trust them with my life.

210
00:15:59,847 --> 00:16:01,360
Don't worry.

211
00:16:09,047 --> 00:16:11,038
The machine was designed
to mine naquadria.

212
00:16:11,127 --> 00:16:15,325
In the terms of our alliance, information
relating to naquadria is to be shared.

213
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:16,601
We were misled.

214
00:16:16,687 --> 00:16:19,884
We intended to tell you
once the prototype was fully operational.

215
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,527
Do you take us for idiots?

216
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,565
It was you that created this disaster.

217
00:16:25,647 --> 00:16:29,162
And now you expect to benefit
by acquiring alien technology?

218
00:16:29,247 --> 00:16:34,162
It was unfortunate the Kelownans
didn't reveal this information sooner.

219
00:16:34,247 --> 00:16:37,922
However, regarding the Tok'ra crystals,
you really have no choice.

220
00:16:38,007 --> 00:16:41,522
Without them we won't reach the
naquadria vein in time to save your world.

221
00:16:41,607 --> 00:16:43,598
It's that simple.

222
00:16:51,007 --> 00:16:53,316
Wow. Jonas.

223
00:16:53,407 --> 00:16:56,319
This technology
is beyond anything I've seen in Kelowna.

224
00:16:56,927 --> 00:17:01,557
I made some adjustments based on
what I learned in Stargate Command.

225
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:03,239
Pretty amazing.

226
00:17:03,327 --> 00:17:06,444
Yeah, I tell you,
most of the credit goes to Kianna.

227
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:08,597
- Kianna?
- Oh, yeah.

228
00:17:08,687 --> 00:17:12,202
She took what she learned from me
and made modifications to the hydraulics,

229
00:17:12,287 --> 00:17:16,041
the shielding mechanisms, everything.

230
00:17:16,127 --> 00:17:20,917
Without her, this thing would be
months away from being operational.

231
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:24,156
You two
have been working closely on this.

232
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:27,440
Yeah, I guess.

233
00:17:27,927 --> 00:17:31,442
- What?
- Come on, Jonas, I'm not blind.

234
00:17:31,527 --> 00:17:33,802
What's going on?

235
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:36,879
Let's just say
that it's in the development stage.

236
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:39,003
Although I do find her interesting.

237
00:17:39,847 --> 00:17:41,997
I bet you do.

238
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:37,723
Teal'c.
I trust your mission was a success?

239
00:18:37,807 --> 00:18:41,243
Indeed. The crystals you requested.

240
00:18:41,327 --> 00:18:44,125
Thank you.

241
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,675
How are the negotiations progressing?

242
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:50,601
Well, they finally agreed to send
a three-person delegation to Madronas

243
00:18:50,687 --> 00:18:52,757
to evaluate it as an evacuation site.

244
00:18:52,847 --> 00:18:54,838
What of Jonas and Major Carter?

245
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:57,805
They're adjusting
the Kelownan excavation machine.

246
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:01,197
It should be ready for launch
within 24 hours.

247
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:14,965
Hey. Just in time to help me
run a few diagnostic programs.

248
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:20,166
What?

249
00:19:20,247 --> 00:19:24,399
Jonas, did you design
the primary power distribution circuits?

250
00:19:24,487 --> 00:19:26,478
I didn't really design anything.

251
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:28,797
I did make suggestions for upgrades.

252
00:19:28,887 --> 00:19:32,357
Based on advanced technology
you encountered with SG-1?

253
00:19:32,447 --> 00:19:34,677
Yeah, that's right.

254
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:36,758
Why, what's wrong?

255
00:19:36,847 --> 00:19:38,917
The hardware's different,

256
00:19:39,007 --> 00:19:42,443
but the basic principle
is very similar to a Goa'uld design.

257
00:19:43,087 --> 00:19:45,806
- That's impossible.
- I went over it three times.

258
00:19:45,887 --> 00:19:48,003
I probably wouldn't have noticed

259
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:55,277
if I hadn't calculated that the generators
were operating at 130% efficiency.

260
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:57,835
No.

261
00:19:57,927 --> 00:20:02,205
- There's some mistake.
- Jonas, who did design the system?

262
00:20:12,327 --> 00:20:14,887
Jonas, what's going on?

263
00:20:14,967 --> 00:20:17,606
- We know.
- What are you talking about?

264
00:20:17,687 --> 00:20:21,202
- Who do you serve?
- Jonas, whatever you think...

265
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:25,121
- Whatever she told you is a lie.
- They searched your quarters.

266
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:29,325
Do you want to explain why they found
a Goa'uld communication device?

267
00:20:37,607 --> 00:20:39,996
Very well.
You know the truth.

268
00:20:40,087 --> 00:20:42,840
Now how shall we proceed?

269
00:20:50,487 --> 00:20:54,275
I'm assuming this is the drug
that allowed you to escape detection.

270
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:57,837
It somehow masks the presence
of a symbiote, right?

271
00:20:58,687 --> 00:21:01,406
I'm sending this
back to the SGC for analysis.

272
00:21:01,487 --> 00:21:03,523
How long have you been on this planet?

273
00:21:03,607 --> 00:21:06,121
We knew Anubis came here for a reason.

274
00:21:06,207 --> 00:21:10,439
After his defeat I was despatched to find
out why he was so interested in this place.

275
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,405
So you work for Baal?

276
00:21:13,487 --> 00:21:15,682
I gained access to Kelowna's research

277
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:19,362
by implanting myself
in a scientist on the naquadria project.

278
00:21:19,447 --> 00:21:21,324
Let me talk to Kianna.

279
00:21:22,567 --> 00:21:25,240
In a small way
I've grown to admire this host.

280
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:30,082
She is exceptionally astute.
A superior specimen.

281
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:31,361
Let me talk to her.

282
00:21:31,447 --> 00:21:35,076
I made the major modifications
to the excavator.

283
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:39,160
If you wish to complete this undertaking,
you will require my assistance.

284
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:41,317
Why would you help us?

285
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:46,246
We share a common goal.
I too wish to save this world.

286
00:21:46,327 --> 00:21:51,117
So you can hand it over to Baal?
I don't think so.

287
00:21:51,207 --> 00:21:54,438
Jonas.

288
00:21:56,207 --> 00:21:57,959
Kianna?

289
00:21:58,047 --> 00:22:00,766
She's right. You're going to need her.

290
00:22:03,767 --> 00:22:06,281
Let her help you,
for the sake of our people.

291
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:11,043
It's not her, Jonas. It's a Goa'uld
trying to fool us. We've seen it before.

292
00:22:11,127 --> 00:22:14,039
No. Jonas, please.

293
00:22:15,847 --> 00:22:18,884
Get her outta here.

294
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:27,476
Depth is 2200 metres.

295
00:22:27,567 --> 00:22:31,003
Speed 1.5 metres per second.

296
00:22:32,287 --> 00:22:35,006
- The drills are running hot.
- All right.

297
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:38,875
Bring down your RPMs.
Don't overcompensate.

298
00:22:39,927 --> 00:22:46,036
- I can't stay ahead of these adjustments.
- You're gonna stall us out. Power up.

299
00:22:48,407 --> 00:22:51,160
You stripped the drill heads.

300
00:22:51,247 --> 00:22:53,920
Control. End simulation.

301
00:22:55,687 --> 00:22:59,157
Jonas, we've got a problem.

302
00:23:00,247 --> 00:23:03,000
Could this
be the result of Goa'uld sabotage?

303
00:23:03,087 --> 00:23:06,636
No. Major Carter believes
the Goa'uld's modifications

304
00:23:06,727 --> 00:23:10,117
have improved the speed
and efficiency of the drills.

305
00:23:10,207 --> 00:23:12,721
The system requires
constant adjustments

306
00:23:12,807 --> 00:23:15,480
according to the material
it's passing through.

307
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:19,560
It's kind of like shifting gears in a racecar.

308
00:23:19,647 --> 00:23:23,356
Major Carter isn't confident
in her ability to run the drill.

309
00:23:23,447 --> 00:23:26,803
She thinks the best person for the job
is the Goa'uld.

310
00:23:26,887 --> 00:23:28,878
You can't be serious.

311
00:23:28,967 --> 00:23:32,039
We could overhaul the system
and eliminate the modifications,

312
00:23:32,127 --> 00:23:36,325
but that would reduce the speed
of the excavator and it would take weeks.

313
00:23:36,407 --> 00:23:38,398
We don't have that kind of time.

314
00:23:38,487 --> 00:23:41,001
The Goa'uld could have
sabotaged it any time.

315
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,999
Instead she helped Jonas
improve several key systems.

316
00:23:44,087 --> 00:23:47,159
Only to preserve
the naquadria deposit for Baal.

317
00:23:47,247 --> 00:23:50,796
Maybe so, but averting the explosion
is our first priority.

318
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:53,765
Without the Goa'uld, we have no chance.

319
00:24:10,447 --> 00:24:12,597
You've made the right choice.

320
00:24:12,687 --> 00:24:14,962
Your confidence in me
will not go unrewarded.

321
00:24:15,047 --> 00:24:19,518
We had no choice. And for the record,
our confidence in you is minimal.

322
00:24:20,407 --> 00:24:25,276
Which is, no doubt,
why the shol'va will be accompanying us.

323
00:24:27,407 --> 00:24:29,682
And why all of you are armed.

324
00:24:32,087 --> 00:24:35,682
- Who calibrated the primary inductors?
- I did.

325
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:39,203
Launch now and you will burn
through them before you pass 100 metres.

326
00:24:41,087 --> 00:24:43,078
Right. I'll take navigation.

327
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:46,000
Teal'c, take shields and life support.

328
00:24:46,687 --> 00:24:48,678
Indeed.

329
00:24:55,807 --> 00:24:59,516
We are go for launch
in 30 seconds.

330
00:25:01,087 --> 00:25:03,601
Powering up.

331
00:25:03,687 --> 00:25:06,645
Engines are at 70%.

332
00:25:08,767 --> 00:25:10,758
80.

333
00:25:11,767 --> 00:25:15,555
- Shields are active.
- Navigation computer is online.

334
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,161
Engines are at full power.

335
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:20,718
Control, we're set to go for launch...

336
00:25:21,447 --> 00:25:28,319
in five... four... three... two... one.

337
00:25:41,447 --> 00:25:44,405
We've just received word from Kelowna.

338
00:25:44,487 --> 00:25:48,924
Our security personnel monitored
a communication device of Kianna's.

339
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:51,726
Apparently a message
has come through from Baal.

340
00:25:51,807 --> 00:25:55,800
She's overdue to report. He's waiting
for her to send a transmission.

341
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:59,562
- And if she doesn't?
- They'll come to find out what happened.

342
00:25:59,647 --> 00:26:02,480
That's a distinct possibility.

343
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:10,721
What is it?

344
00:26:10,807 --> 00:26:13,526
We are losing coolant pressure
in one of the forward tubes.

345
00:26:13,607 --> 00:26:16,724
We must have broken a seal.

346
00:26:16,807 --> 00:26:19,799
Major Carter, take the controls.

347
00:26:19,887 --> 00:26:21,878
Where are you going?

348
00:26:21,967 --> 00:26:25,596
I can divert coolant from the aft,
but I have to do it from the engine room.

349
00:26:25,687 --> 00:26:27,484
I'm coming with you.

350
00:26:30,087 --> 00:26:33,124
You still do not trust me, do you?

351
00:26:33,207 --> 00:26:35,198
No.

352
00:26:37,607 --> 00:26:40,599
Is there any way to contact the excavator?

353
00:26:40,687 --> 00:26:44,475
They're too deep. No radio signal
could penetrate that much solid rock.

354
00:26:44,567 --> 00:26:48,480
Telling them about Baal's message
will not change anything.

355
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:50,558
If the Goa'uld doesn't make it back?

356
00:26:50,647 --> 00:26:52,956
That would only happen
if the mission fails.

357
00:26:53,047 --> 00:26:55,766
If that's the case,
Baal will be the least of your problems.

358
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:59,760
I suggest we get back
to planning your relocation.

359
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:09,762
- Check it now.
- Forward pressure's rising.

360
00:27:11,647 --> 00:27:13,638
We're good.

361
00:27:16,487 --> 00:27:19,445
Maybe now you'll believe
that I wish this mission to succeed?

362
00:27:19,527 --> 00:27:21,597
Yeah - for the wrong reasons.

363
00:27:21,687 --> 00:27:26,636
Has it ever occurred to you that serving
Baal may not be my only interest here?

364
00:27:26,727 --> 00:27:31,801
I never thought I'd find
the company of a human so intriguing.

365
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:35,606
And suddenly I repulse you?

366
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:38,076
Not that long ago you felt differently.

367
00:27:38,167 --> 00:27:42,206
That was before I found out who you are.
What you are.

368
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:48,237
And yet the fact remains...
you never knew the host before I took her.

369
00:27:48,327 --> 00:27:52,366
All this time it was never Kianna,
it was always me.

370
00:28:04,327 --> 00:28:06,363
- What is happening?
- I'm not sure.

371
00:28:06,447 --> 00:28:09,439
We're still on course, still descending.

372
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:20,522
Hull temperature is rising rapidly.

373
00:28:20,607 --> 00:28:22,677
300 degrees.

374
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,723
400 degrees and still rising.

375
00:28:24,807 --> 00:28:27,196
Is there any volcanic activity in the area?

376
00:28:27,287 --> 00:28:30,085
Mount Kallan. But it's been dormant
for hundreds of years.

377
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:34,001
Just because it's dormant doesn't mean
there couldn't be magma flows.

378
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,885
Hull temperature is 700 degrees
and still rising.

379
00:28:37,487 --> 00:28:40,559
We're passing through a river
of molten rock.

380
00:28:47,527 --> 00:28:51,076
Daniel, how's the whole diplomacy thing
working out for you?

381
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:53,362
The latest argument's about selection -

382
00:28:53,447 --> 00:28:58,202
a lottery, assigning positions or setting up
a committee to discuss the problem.

383
00:28:58,287 --> 00:29:04,522
I remind them they're facing annihilation,
but they can't face their own mistrust.

384
00:29:04,607 --> 00:29:09,556
- I think I can help you out on this.
- What do you mean?

385
00:29:10,327 --> 00:29:12,363
Hull temperature is 1100 degrees.

386
00:29:12,447 --> 00:29:16,725
- The ship will not take much more of this.
- Divert power to the shields.

387
00:29:16,807 --> 00:29:19,480
We have no way of knowing
how thick this vein of magma is.

388
00:29:19,567 --> 00:29:23,640
- If we turn back now, we may survive.
- I said divert power to the shields.

389
00:29:29,887 --> 00:29:35,041
Power diverted. Although I'm not sure
how much difference it will make.

390
00:29:35,647 --> 00:29:39,083
Hull temperature is 1200 degrees.

391
00:29:40,527 --> 00:29:44,202
Do you really want to risk your life
for the people of this world, Major?

392
00:29:44,287 --> 00:29:48,166
I am not so sure
they would do the same for you.

393
00:29:51,527 --> 00:29:54,087
We're losing hull integrity!

394
00:30:03,207 --> 00:30:05,198
Teal'c?

395
00:30:05,807 --> 00:30:09,720
Hull temperature is dropping.
1100 degrees and still falling.

396
00:30:12,567 --> 00:30:14,558
We made it through.

397
00:30:18,607 --> 00:30:20,598
Very impressive.

398
00:30:24,647 --> 00:30:27,844
Kelowna will accept nothing less
than equal representation.

399
00:30:27,927 --> 00:30:31,636
Really? Kelowna is solely responsible
for this problem.

400
00:30:31,727 --> 00:30:35,003
Need I remind you
that the Stargate is in our possession?

401
00:30:35,087 --> 00:30:37,282
- For the moment.
- Is that a threat?

402
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:41,883
When it comes to the survival of our
people, we will do whatever is necessary.

403
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:46,279
Now you want a war? We're trying to save
your world and you wanna destroy it?

404
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:48,835
Save your breath, Daniel.

405
00:30:50,847 --> 00:30:54,203
- You folks are done.
- I don't understand.

406
00:30:54,967 --> 00:30:58,642
Well, you see,
we actually like the Madronans.

407
00:30:58,727 --> 00:31:00,718
They're nice people.

408
00:31:00,807 --> 00:31:05,358
We've decided there's no way
we'd subject them to the likes of you.

409
00:31:06,727 --> 00:31:08,957
Deal's off. You're toast.

410
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:12,727
- General?
- Colonel O'Neill's right.

411
00:31:12,807 --> 00:31:15,799
You can stay until we hear back
from Jonas and Major Carter.

412
00:31:19,527 --> 00:31:21,722
It's what you get for dickin' around.

413
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:27,678
Something's wrong.

414
00:31:27,767 --> 00:31:31,601
We're losing speed.
1.5 metres per second and slowing.

415
00:31:31,687 --> 00:31:35,600
It is the forward drills.
They were damaged by the magma.

416
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:38,076
They are coming apart.

417
00:31:43,207 --> 00:31:46,279
- We stopped.
- Forward drill's finished.

418
00:31:47,807 --> 00:31:49,798
Cutting power.

419
00:31:52,207 --> 00:31:56,439
- It's as deep as we're gonna get.
- What is our position?

420
00:31:57,927 --> 00:32:01,715
We're still over a kilometre
from the target.

421
00:32:04,287 --> 00:32:06,243
What if we drop the bomb here?

422
00:32:06,327 --> 00:32:11,037
We're too far from the fault line.
It would be pointless.

423
00:32:11,767 --> 00:32:14,361
Then we have failed.

424
00:32:26,807 --> 00:32:30,766
- We have to go back and repair the ship.
- Too much damage. It'll take weeks.

425
00:32:30,847 --> 00:32:34,522
I'm sorry, Jonas,
but we don't have a choice.

426
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:39,239
We still have crystals. We can use those
to tunnel the rest of the way.

427
00:32:39,327 --> 00:32:43,639
- They'd never make it far enough.
- If we focus them,

428
00:32:43,727 --> 00:32:46,036
we can dig a passage
big enough for one person.

429
00:32:46,127 --> 00:32:49,119
- That will give us the distance we need.
- It might work.

430
00:32:49,207 --> 00:32:54,201
But at this depth, the heat and the gases
would penetrate even a Tok'ra tunnel.

431
00:32:54,287 --> 00:32:56,403
- It would be suicide.
- I will go.

432
00:33:02,927 --> 00:33:04,918
Do not worry, Major Carter.

433
00:33:05,007 --> 00:33:09,637
I may be intrigued by your willingness
to sacrifice yourself, but I do not share it.

434
00:33:09,727 --> 00:33:13,163
- My symbiote will protect me.
- Why take the risk?

435
00:33:13,927 --> 00:33:16,600
You still think of me
as nothing but a servant of Baal.

436
00:33:16,687 --> 00:33:18,962
You are mistaken.

437
00:33:19,047 --> 00:33:21,925
You haven't told him about the naquadria?

438
00:33:22,007 --> 00:33:23,998
Not yet.

439
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:26,442
You want it for yourself.

440
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:33,841
The fact remains that I am the only one
who can complete this mission.

441
00:33:46,327 --> 00:33:48,124
The tunnel is complete.

442
00:33:48,207 --> 00:33:50,243
You understand
the detonation procedure?

443
00:33:50,327 --> 00:33:53,603
Of course. It is a simple enough device.

444
00:34:42,887 --> 00:34:44,957
I am in position.

445
00:34:50,367 --> 00:34:52,358
I am setting...

446
00:34:53,847 --> 00:34:55,838
the detonator.

447
00:35:08,527 --> 00:35:10,802
This is not good.

448
00:35:17,767 --> 00:35:19,997
Kianna, this is Major Carter. Do you read?

449
00:35:21,447 --> 00:35:22,436
Go ahead.

450
00:35:22,527 --> 00:35:25,405
We're losing power. I think
the generators have been damaged.

451
00:35:25,967 --> 00:35:30,199
I was afraid of that.
How much power do you have left?

452
00:35:30,887 --> 00:35:33,526
We're down to 70%.

453
00:35:37,287 --> 00:35:40,962
- So much for my empire!
- Say again.

454
00:35:42,847 --> 00:35:46,760
If you begin the ascent now,

455
00:35:48,167 --> 00:35:51,876
you may have enough power
to reach the surface.

456
00:35:52,407 --> 00:35:56,082
- We're not leaving you behind.
- You have no choice.

457
00:35:56,167 --> 00:36:00,285
If the power drops below 50%,

458
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:05,760
you will not even be able
to restart the engines.

459
00:36:06,407 --> 00:36:08,398
I am already dead.

460
00:36:08,847 --> 00:36:11,645
If you wait, you die too.

461
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:18,438
This is Jonas. There's still time left.
Start back immediately.

462
00:36:19,087 --> 00:36:23,558
If you are doing this
out of concern for the host,

463
00:36:23,647 --> 00:36:26,115
you need not bother.

464
00:36:27,527 --> 00:36:32,920
The body is already severely damaged.

465
00:36:33,007 --> 00:36:36,761
Even if we make it back,

466
00:36:36,847 --> 00:36:39,759
I may not be able to keep her alive.

467
00:36:39,847 --> 00:36:44,602
Listen to me. We're not going without you,
so shut up and get moving.

468
00:37:11,407 --> 00:37:15,798
- We should have heard by now.
- Something went wrong.

469
00:37:21,487 --> 00:37:24,001
Power's down to 53%.

470
00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:28,516
She's taking twice as long to get back
as she took to get down.

471
00:37:28,607 --> 00:37:30,643
Kianna? This is Jonas.

472
00:37:30,727 --> 00:37:32,877
Come in. Over.

473
00:37:35,207 --> 00:37:37,198
Please respond.

474
00:37:38,687 --> 00:37:41,520
I believe we have no choice
but to begin our ascent.

475
00:38:04,847 --> 00:38:08,123
I'll take care of her. Get us outta here.

476
00:38:11,367 --> 00:38:13,927
Powering up engines.

477
00:38:15,047 --> 00:38:18,005
Beginning ascent.

478
00:38:21,887 --> 00:38:25,402
- You waited.
- You held up your end of the bargain.

479
00:38:25,487 --> 00:38:28,206
Was that your only reason?

480
00:38:32,327 --> 00:38:35,000
I already know your answer.

481
00:38:45,127 --> 00:38:47,880
Unscheduled offworld activation.

482
00:38:59,007 --> 00:39:01,965
- Receiving a signal. Audio only.
- Put it through.

483
00:39:02,047 --> 00:39:05,596
- Gate control to First Minister Dreylock.
- This is Dreylock. Go ahead.

484
00:39:05,687 --> 00:39:09,157
We're receiving reports.
A major seismic disturbance.

485
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:12,045
Survey places the epicentre
at the target coordinates.

486
00:39:12,127 --> 00:39:14,436
- They did it.
- Any word from the excavator?

487
00:39:14,527 --> 00:39:16,995
Negative.

488
00:39:19,727 --> 00:39:25,802
- The power reserves are near depletion.
- We're almost there. Ten seconds.

489
00:39:27,607 --> 00:39:33,796
Five seconds. Four. Three. Two. One.

490
00:39:55,447 --> 00:39:57,438
You miss it?

491
00:39:59,287 --> 00:40:02,040
Yeah. I do.

492
00:40:04,807 --> 00:40:08,277
Judging from what you've got to deal with
in Kelowna, I'm not surprised.

493
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:11,916
I'd take danger over
one of those council meetings any day.

494
00:40:12,007 --> 00:40:13,804
Yeah.

495
00:40:13,887 --> 00:40:18,483
I don't know what Jack said to 'em, but
they are being a little more cooperative.

496
00:40:18,567 --> 00:40:20,956
Let's hope it lasts.

497
00:40:23,207 --> 00:40:26,916
- How are you feeling?
- Fine, I guess.

498
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:30,602
I remember everything,
but it's like a dream.

499
00:40:30,687 --> 00:40:34,043
- The symbiote's dead.
- She saved me.

500
