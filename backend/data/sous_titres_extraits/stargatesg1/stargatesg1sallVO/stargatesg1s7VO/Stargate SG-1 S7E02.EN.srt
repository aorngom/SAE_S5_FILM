1
00:00:05,327 --> 00:00:08,160
Previously on "Stargate SG-1":

2
00:00:10,527 --> 00:00:13,200
- Do you not recognise us, Daniel?
- I'm sorry.

3
00:00:13,287 --> 00:00:16,836
You were a member of my team, SG-1.
You're a friend of mine.

4
00:00:16,927 --> 00:00:21,045
- We are in position to ambush Anubis...
- Do not question me. Do as I say!

5
00:00:21,127 --> 00:00:24,403
Activating hyperdrive.

6
00:00:28,727 --> 00:00:31,719
Target is locked. Fox 4-2.

7
00:00:36,887 --> 00:00:41,005
- You will suffer gravely.
- I won't tell you anything.

8
00:00:41,087 --> 00:00:43,123
Yes, you will.

9
00:00:53,647 --> 00:00:57,640
- Receiving IDC, sir. It's SG-1.
- Open the iris.

10
00:01:07,927 --> 00:01:09,918
Colonel. Major.

11
00:01:10,007 --> 00:01:13,761
Our mission was a success. Anubis's
new weapon has been neutralised.

12
00:01:13,847 --> 00:01:15,246
Well done.

13
00:01:15,327 --> 00:01:18,319
- What about Jonas and Dr Jackson?
- Still on the ship.

14
00:01:18,407 --> 00:01:22,559
- Anubis went into hyperspace.
- Do we have any idea where they went?

15
00:01:22,647 --> 00:01:24,842
No, sir.

16
00:01:36,007 --> 00:01:39,795
You appear to be unharmed
by the mind probe.

17
00:01:39,887 --> 00:01:42,162
I appreciate the concern.

18
00:01:42,247 --> 00:01:46,035
You seem calm,
considering some lowly humans

19
00:01:46,127 --> 00:01:50,678
just put a serious crimp
in your plans for galactic domination.

20
00:01:50,767 --> 00:01:53,645
Your insolence amuses me.

21
00:01:53,727 --> 00:01:57,083
I've learnt many valuable things
from you, Jonas Quinn.

22
00:01:57,167 --> 00:02:01,604
I now know Dr Jackson
accompanied you aboard this ship.

23
00:02:01,687 --> 00:02:06,477
- Do you know where he is?
- He continues to elude our sensors,

24
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:08,876
but his time is running out.

25
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:14,803
- Nothing you learnt from me'll help you.
- Oh, we will see about that.

26
00:02:14,887 --> 00:02:17,276
Have a look out the window.

27
00:02:23,887 --> 00:02:26,606
We dropped out of hyperspace.

28
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:30,999
I'm eager to find out more about
this powerful variation of naqahdah

29
00:02:31,087 --> 00:02:33,521
discovered on your planet.

30
00:02:33,607 --> 00:02:36,280
I believe you call it "Naquadria".

31
00:02:37,807 --> 00:02:39,399
Where are we?

32
00:02:39,487 --> 00:02:42,684
Welcome home, Jonas Quinn.

33
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:06,205
I just got a report from the Tok'ra. They've
no news on the location of Anubis's ship.

34
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:10,997
- What about Teal'c?
- We can only assume he's with Yu's fleet.

35
00:04:11,087 --> 00:04:13,442
Any idea why they didn't show?

36
00:04:13,527 --> 00:04:16,837
- I could make a guess.
- You think Yu hung us out to dry?

37
00:04:16,927 --> 00:04:19,236
I'm not gonna touch that, sir.

38
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:24,196
- I don't think he made a deal with Anubis.
- Trust a Goa'uld, this is what you get.

39
00:04:24,287 --> 00:04:27,199
I understand how you feel,
but I approved this operation

40
00:04:27,287 --> 00:04:31,724
because I believed it was our best chance
to deal Anubis a crippling blow.

41
00:04:31,807 --> 00:04:36,278
- Yes, sir.
- Unscheduled offworld activation.

42
00:04:44,847 --> 00:04:47,759
Receiving a radio signal, sir.

43
00:04:47,847 --> 00:04:50,839
This is Ambassador Dreylock
of the Kelownan High Council.

44
00:04:50,927 --> 00:04:53,316
General Hammond of Stargate Command.

45
00:04:53,407 --> 00:04:56,444
We request immediate assistance.
We are under attack.

46
00:04:56,527 --> 00:05:01,317
We've been over this. We can't interfere
in the internal affairs of your planet.

47
00:05:01,407 --> 00:05:07,403
You don't understand. We are under
attack from a Goa'uld called Anubis.

48
00:05:31,527 --> 00:05:33,597
Why have I been detained?

49
00:05:36,687 --> 00:05:38,484
Lord Yu is without honour.

50
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:40,762
- Shol'va!
- Jaffa!

51
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:43,798
Kree jel-na.

52
00:05:53,607 --> 00:05:55,404
We had an agreement.

53
00:05:55,487 --> 00:05:58,081
You have not been betrayed.

54
00:05:58,887 --> 00:06:00,878
Not deliberately.

55
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:04,162
I do not understand.

56
00:06:06,887 --> 00:06:09,276
My master is not well.

57
00:06:10,247 --> 00:06:14,001
He spends most of his time
in the sarcophagus. He is there even now.

58
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:16,317
Why does he not take another host?

59
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:19,604
I believe he has reached the point
where he is incapable.

60
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:24,398
Lord Yu is the oldest of the System Lords.

61
00:06:24,487 --> 00:06:27,365
He has reigned for countless centuries,

62
00:06:27,447 --> 00:06:31,599
but now I'm beginning to fear
that even gods cannot live forever.

63
00:06:31,687 --> 00:06:33,643
Lord Yu is not a god.

64
00:06:36,847 --> 00:06:40,726
Once I would have struck you down
for speaking those words.

65
00:06:40,807 --> 00:06:42,798
But now?

66
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:49,081
He was convinced that Anubis
was in the Chodawa system.

67
00:06:51,607 --> 00:06:56,283
And even though I knew this was
not the case, I could not contradict him.

68
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:59,882
But you have seen that
Lord Yu can make mistakes.

69
00:06:59,967 --> 00:07:03,323
He has become increasingly
paranoid and confused.

70
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:07,036
He speaks to himself,
but his words make no sense.

71
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:14,283
He forgets key details of our attack plans,
and grows angry when I remind him.

72
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:19,236
If what you say is true,
you and your Jaffa are in grave danger.

73
00:07:19,327 --> 00:07:23,605
- You must do something.
- I cannot betray him.

74
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:25,882
I have devoted my life to his service.

75
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:29,562
If this continues,
Lord Yu's empire will fall.

76
00:07:29,647 --> 00:07:32,241
Millions of Jaffa will die.

77
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:35,797
Lord Yu will be remembered as a fool.

78
00:07:35,887 --> 00:07:39,084
What meaning will your life have then?

79
00:07:59,007 --> 00:08:02,238
- Have they agreed to help us?
- Not yet.

80
00:08:09,847 --> 00:08:12,805
Colonel O'Neill. Major Carter.

81
00:08:12,887 --> 00:08:15,481
- Ambassador. Commander.
- Thank you for coming.

82
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:19,082
- What's going on, kids?
- A ship is hovering over the city.

83
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,882
Alien troops have taken
the capitol building and other positions.

84
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:24,366
Where are we?

85
00:08:24,447 --> 00:08:29,237
This bunker is several hundred feet below
an army base on the outskirts of the city.

86
00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:32,763
The communicator should work.
It can transmit from Tok'ra tunnels.

87
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:37,284
- I don't understand.
- Two of our people may be on that ship,

88
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:39,358
one being Jonas Quinn.

89
00:08:41,847 --> 00:08:43,326
Daniel?

90
00:08:43,407 --> 00:08:45,796
Daniel, come in. It's O'Neill.

91
00:08:47,447 --> 00:08:49,438
Daniel?

92
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:53,565
- Jack?
- What's your situation?

93
00:08:56,607 --> 00:09:00,361
- I'm hiding. What's yours?
- Carter and I are on the planet.

94
00:09:00,447 --> 00:09:03,962
Be more specific. I haven't had
a chance to look out a window.

95
00:09:04,047 --> 00:09:07,835
- You're hovering over Jonas's home.
- Why?

96
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:10,680
I wish I knew.
Are you in any immediate danger?

97
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:13,201
Depends on what you mean
by "immediate".

98
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:15,437
- Daniel.
- I'm fine.

99
00:09:15,527 --> 00:09:20,203
I got a location on Jonas's cell,
but first I've got a couple of problems.

100
00:09:20,287 --> 00:09:21,925
Like what?

101
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:26,478
I'm not sure how to shut off
the force field protecting his cell yet.

102
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,478
You said a couple?

103
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:33,561
Yeah, actually, I'm a little lost.
And I've only got about three hours left

104
00:09:33,647 --> 00:09:37,356
before the Tok'ra isotope wears off
and I'm visible to the sensors.

105
00:09:37,447 --> 00:09:41,281
- So business as usual then, huh?
- I don't know. Is it?

106
00:09:43,247 --> 00:09:49,083
- Yes, we do this kind of thing all the time.
- Oh, well, good. That's comforting then.

107
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,640
This is a mistake.

108
00:09:55,727 --> 00:10:00,403
Lord Yu can no longer be permitted
to command the opposition to Anubis.

109
00:10:00,487 --> 00:10:03,718
His Jaffa will follow your orders
in his name, but others will not.

110
00:10:03,807 --> 00:10:06,196
We need the combined force
of the System Lords.

111
00:10:06,287 --> 00:10:10,439
- None of them can be trusted.
- Nonetheless, one must be chosen.

112
00:10:12,807 --> 00:10:15,401
The signal is coming through.

113
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:24,242
- What is the meaning of this?
- Lord Baal...

114
00:10:24,327 --> 00:10:28,559
Where is your master? Why do you
allow this shol'va to appear before me?

115
00:10:28,647 --> 00:10:32,401
- I am here to present an offer.
- I will not listen to a traitor.

116
00:10:32,487 --> 00:10:38,164
Then you will miss an opportunity
to rid yourself of Anubis forever.

117
00:10:40,287 --> 00:10:44,519
When the ship appeared,
we were caught completely off guard.

118
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:48,282
There was widespread panic.
Before we knew what was happening,

119
00:10:48,367 --> 00:10:52,440
most of the High Council
had been taken hostage.

120
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:57,043
When we wouldn't give in to his demands,
Anubis had the First Minister executed.

121
00:10:57,127 --> 00:11:00,642
He also fired a volley
into our industrial sector,

122
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:06,404
destroying several factories
and killing many innocent citizens.

123
00:11:07,327 --> 00:11:11,115
After that, we gave him what he wanted.

124
00:11:12,407 --> 00:11:14,967
- Which was?
- Naquadria.

125
00:11:15,047 --> 00:11:17,436
Our entire stockpile.

126
00:11:18,527 --> 00:11:23,237
Commander. We're receiving
a transmission from the surface.

127
00:11:23,327 --> 00:11:25,318
Excuse me a moment.

128
00:11:29,087 --> 00:11:33,922
Anubis must've used that mind probe on
Jonas and found out about the Naquadria.

129
00:11:34,007 --> 00:11:36,601
Then he knows the stuff
only works half the time.

130
00:11:36,687 --> 00:11:41,681
Just cos we can't establish a stable power
output doesn't mean he won't. If he does...

131
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,645
Tadada-dah, ta-dah!

132
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:58,436
The truth is my master is no longer fit
to lead the forces of the System Lords.

133
00:11:58,527 --> 00:12:01,280
How dare you judge your god?

134
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:04,200
The shol'va has poisoned your mind.

135
00:12:04,287 --> 00:12:06,482
Clearly, Lord Baal is not interested.

136
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:11,595
- We should contact another System Lord.
- Hm. Perhaps Bastet.

137
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:16,807
If I assume command, how can I be
assured of the loyalty of Yu's troops?

138
00:12:16,887 --> 00:12:19,355
They will follow me in his name.

139
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,039
And will you obey me?

140
00:12:21,127 --> 00:12:24,563
The destruction of Anubis
is in my master's best interest.

141
00:12:24,647 --> 00:12:29,198
I will support any action
that leads to this goal.

142
00:12:29,287 --> 00:12:33,997
If you are in agreement, I must contact
the Tauri to make the final arrangements.

143
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,203
Then do so.

144
00:12:37,607 --> 00:12:40,405
Take me to the nearest Stargate.

145
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:04,839
Commander, you said you gave Anubis
your entire stockpile of Naquadria.

146
00:13:04,927 --> 00:13:06,519
That's correct.

147
00:13:06,607 --> 00:13:09,075
So if he got what he wanted,
why is he still here?

148
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:10,759
I have no idea.

149
00:13:10,847 --> 00:13:14,840
His men have rounded up archaeologists
from the Academy of Sciences.

150
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:18,124
- He may be looking for the Stargate.
- How secure is this place?

151
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,198
It's top secret.

152
00:13:20,287 --> 00:13:24,599
We had the gate moved here after the
Tiranians and Andaris began air strikes.

153
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:26,484
So you did go to war?

154
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:30,116
Yes, but we managed
to negotiate a cease-fire.

155
00:13:30,207 --> 00:13:33,119
I thought you were
outgunned and outmanned.

156
00:13:36,207 --> 00:13:39,324
We used the Naquadria bomb.

157
00:13:39,407 --> 00:13:41,637
On people?

158
00:13:41,727 --> 00:13:46,801
We instantly regretted it. The devastation
was beyond anything we'd imagined.

159
00:13:46,887 --> 00:13:51,165
As many Kelownans
would have died had we done nothing.

160
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,842
We were faced with our own destruction
and you refused to help us.

161
00:13:54,927 --> 00:13:59,205
And, as awful as it was, it managed to
bring Tiranians and Andaris to the table.

162
00:13:59,287 --> 00:14:02,359
Delegates had just arrived
in the city for peace talks.

163
00:14:02,447 --> 00:14:05,086
- Do they know about the Stargate?
- No.

164
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:09,319
They may have noticed
the rather large ship floating in the sky.

165
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:14,037
- You might as well tell them the rest.
- We were hoping it wouldn't come to that.

166
00:14:14,127 --> 00:14:18,166
Anubis has everything he came for.
He may just leave.

167
00:14:18,247 --> 00:14:22,160
If Anubis can figure out how to overcome
the instability of the Naquadria,

168
00:14:22,247 --> 00:14:25,523
it will give him a significant advantage
over all his enemies.

169
00:14:25,607 --> 00:14:29,919
- He's gonna want more.
- There is no more. The mine is dry.

170
00:14:30,007 --> 00:14:32,441
You think he'll take your word for it?

171
00:14:32,527 --> 00:14:36,759
He will occupy this planet and
enslave your people. We've seen it before.

172
00:14:36,847 --> 00:14:39,042
What can we do?

173
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:45,044
If you want to fight, we'll help you.

174
00:14:45,127 --> 00:14:50,724
But we need the cooperation
of the other major powers on this world.

175
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:05,486
My lord, I have completed
a preliminary analysis of the Naquadria.

176
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:09,276
The potential energy output
is greater than that of regular naqahdah.

177
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,835
It will be hard
to maintain a stable reaction.

178
00:15:11,927 --> 00:15:17,206
This ship must have full power again.
I will not accept failure.

179
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:23,480
My lord, we've already learnt all we can
from Jonas Quinn. Why keep him alive?

180
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:27,924
His physiology merits
further experimentation.

181
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:31,761
He may still prove to be very useful.

182
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,724
Jonas.

183
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:19,196
Jonas, are you there?

184
00:16:19,287 --> 00:16:22,120
- Daniel?
- Yeah. Are you all right?

185
00:16:22,207 --> 00:16:25,324
Yeah, I'm fine. Where are you?

186
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:31,161
I'm in a storage room
about 20 feet from your current position.

187
00:16:31,247 --> 00:16:34,762
- Can you get me out of here?
- I'm working on it.

188
00:16:39,087 --> 00:16:40,964
Colonel O'Neill, Major Carter,

189
00:16:41,047 --> 00:16:44,960
may I present the leaders of the
Tiranian and Andari peace delegations.

190
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:47,561
Ambassador Sevaarin
and Ambassador Noor.

191
00:16:47,647 --> 00:16:51,322
Colonel O'Neill and Major Carter
represent a planet called Earth.

192
00:16:51,407 --> 00:16:53,796
They don't look very alien.

193
00:16:54,687 --> 00:16:56,086
We get that a lot.

194
00:16:58,127 --> 00:17:01,437
And this, of course, is the Stargate.

195
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,596
- How does it work?
- Let's have a look.

196
00:17:10,047 --> 00:17:11,844
Something like that.

197
00:17:11,927 --> 00:17:15,761
- Incredible.
- Isn't it?

198
00:17:19,047 --> 00:17:21,322
He is one of the enemy soldiers.

199
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,716
Relax. He's one of ours.

200
00:17:27,607 --> 00:17:31,361
- It is good to see you both again.
- We got your message from Hammond.

201
00:17:31,447 --> 00:17:35,918
- Are you nuts?
- I believe it to be our only choice, O'Neill.

202
00:17:39,407 --> 00:17:45,357
I don't know quite how to tell you this, but
Anubis has taken the ship to your home.

203
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:47,597
We're above the Kelownan capital.

204
00:17:47,687 --> 00:17:53,000
I know. He wants Naquadria. If it wasn't
for me, he'd never have found out about it.

205
00:17:53,087 --> 00:17:58,115
- Don't blame yourself.
- The point is I joined Stargate Command

206
00:17:58,207 --> 00:18:01,517
so maybe one day I could
protect my planet from the Goa'uld.

207
00:18:01,607 --> 00:18:04,838
- Instead, I brought them right to it.
- We'll find a way out.

208
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:08,397
- Yeah?
- Apparently.

209
00:18:09,927 --> 00:18:13,363
We already trusted one Goa'uld.
Look where it got us.

210
00:18:13,447 --> 00:18:15,836
I do not trust Baal, O'Neill,

211
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:21,206
but I believe, at least for the moment,
his goal is the same as ours.

212
00:18:23,527 --> 00:18:26,121
All right. Have at it.

213
00:18:27,047 --> 00:18:29,641
Oh, yes, you do the talking.

214
00:18:37,687 --> 00:18:41,077
We have made an agreement
with another System Lord named Baal.

215
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:44,876
If we give him your location,
he will bring a fleet and destroy Anubis.

216
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:48,243
You propose to bring
more of these Goa'uld to our world?

217
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,443
For now, Anubis is vulnerable.

218
00:18:50,527 --> 00:18:54,679
He has but one ship and is preoccupied,
but believes his position to be secure

219
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,964
because he knows the other lords
are unaware of this place.

220
00:18:58,047 --> 00:19:02,518
And if Anubis is destroyed, how
do we know this Baal will leave us alone?

221
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:04,757
That is part of the agreement.

222
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:12,006
You say we cannot negotiate with Anubis
and these Goa'uld cannot be trusted.

223
00:19:12,087 --> 00:19:14,601
And yet you ask us to trust another?

224
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:18,760
- Your world faces an imminent threat.
- Kelowna faces the threat.

225
00:19:18,847 --> 00:19:23,079
There are no alien ships
in the skies above Tirania.

226
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:25,840
See what we have to deal with?

227
00:19:25,927 --> 00:19:31,638
Haven't you guys ever heard the story
of the dog and the dancing monkeys?

228
00:19:31,727 --> 00:19:36,847
Has something to do with
getting along and... dancing.

229
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:43,162
Carter.

230
00:19:43,247 --> 00:19:45,556
With all due respect, Mr Ambassador,

231
00:19:45,647 --> 00:19:50,038
when Anubis comes looking for more
Naquadria, he won't respect any borders.

232
00:19:50,127 --> 00:19:53,642
He will tear this planet apart
piece by piece if he has to.

233
00:19:53,727 --> 00:20:00,041
I won't approve any plan unless I have
unanimous agreement from all parties.

234
00:20:07,127 --> 00:20:08,321
My lord.

235
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:11,763
Have you found a way
to overcome the Naquadria's instability?

236
00:20:11,847 --> 00:20:13,439
I believe I have.

237
00:20:13,527 --> 00:20:19,602
Then use it to power one of the ship's
weapons arrays. I want it tested now.

238
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:24,363
- We will need to select a target.
- How fortunate there is a city before us.

239
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,086
I am unsure of the power of this weapon.

240
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:30,842
The blast radius from one shot
could encompass the entire city.

241
00:20:30,927 --> 00:20:33,236
If it does,

242
00:20:33,327 --> 00:20:36,637
you will have my congratulations.

243
00:20:47,727 --> 00:20:50,116
Daniel, this is Sam. Come in.

244
00:20:50,767 --> 00:20:52,758
- Go ahead.
- Did you find Jonas?

245
00:20:52,847 --> 00:20:55,964
Yeah. I'm still having trouble
with the force field.

246
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,845
You're gonna have
to find a way to cut the power.

247
00:20:58,927 --> 00:21:03,079
- How do I do that?
- Unsure. We've two hours to figure it out.

248
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:06,125
- What happens then?
- Baal's fleet arrives.

249
00:21:07,207 --> 00:21:11,485
I've got 15 minutes till this isotope wears
out and I'm visible to the ship's sensors.

250
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:15,355
I'll have to get back to you.
I've got company.

251
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:21,038
Kel nor shol ak'ra.

252
00:21:22,767 --> 00:21:24,405
Reltac.

253
00:21:24,487 --> 00:21:27,559
Tel shek anfar, tel nor moklan n'ral.

254
00:21:33,487 --> 00:21:35,478
Jaffa!

255
00:21:37,727 --> 00:21:39,558
Sarit.

256
00:21:44,647 --> 00:21:48,003
Naquadria generator is online.
We are ready.

257
00:21:48,087 --> 00:21:49,679
Charge the weapon.

258
00:22:20,287 --> 00:22:23,962
- My lord, the generator is overloading.
- Abort the test.

259
00:22:26,047 --> 00:22:27,958
I cannot abate the overload.

260
00:22:35,407 --> 00:22:37,398
Jaffa, kree!

261
00:22:53,967 --> 00:22:57,516
This makes no sense.
I compensated for the instability.

262
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:01,078
Kill him!

263
00:23:14,607 --> 00:23:16,837
Jonas!

264
00:23:16,927 --> 00:23:18,997
- What happened?
- I don't know.

265
00:23:19,087 --> 00:23:24,161
Whatever it was, there's not enough
power to maintain the force fields.

266
00:23:24,247 --> 00:23:25,839
Agh!

267
00:23:25,927 --> 00:23:28,122
- You OK?
- That hurt.

268
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:30,596
- Your arm?
- A little numb.

269
00:23:32,087 --> 00:23:33,281
I think I can make it.

270
00:23:33,367 --> 00:23:38,043
You better. I don't want to have to
take you out of here in a dustpan.

271
00:23:42,127 --> 00:23:43,924
Nice.

272
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:46,805
- How do we get off this thing?
- Cargo ship.

273
00:23:46,887 --> 00:23:50,562
- Which way?
- Uh... this way.

274
00:23:50,647 --> 00:23:51,875
- You sure?
- No.

275
00:23:51,967 --> 00:23:53,161
Right.

276
00:23:59,087 --> 00:24:01,237
- Report.
- We're in position,

277
00:24:01,327 --> 00:24:05,559
but the Kelownans want more troops
to deal with the Jaffa on the ground.

278
00:24:05,647 --> 00:24:08,605
I can't authorise that
without Pentagon approval.

279
00:24:08,687 --> 00:24:15,206
Yes, sir, but I was thinking maybe I could
take SGs 15 and 11 as technical advisors.

280
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:19,439
- What if Baal doesn't show up?
- Could get a little screwy.

281
00:24:19,527 --> 00:24:23,440
But we talked these folks into this.
The least we can do is back 'em up.

282
00:24:23,527 --> 00:24:26,439
- Agreed. Put your teams together.
- Sir.

283
00:24:26,527 --> 00:24:28,324
Anubis has superior shields,

284
00:24:28,407 --> 00:24:33,322
but our intelligence says they're less than
40% effective in a planet's atmosphere.

285
00:24:33,407 --> 00:24:36,160
If Baal attacks while Anubis is weak,
he has a chance.

286
00:24:36,247 --> 00:24:38,044
That's not very reassuring.

287
00:24:38,127 --> 00:24:42,086
We just heard Anubis's men
are ransacking the Museum of Antiquities.

288
00:24:42,167 --> 00:24:46,206
- Why would they do that?
- They may still be looking for the gate.

289
00:24:46,287 --> 00:24:50,997
No. Anubis is smart enough to know
that it wouldn't be in a public place.

290
00:24:51,087 --> 00:24:53,078
- What was in the museum?
- Nothing.

291
00:24:53,167 --> 00:24:55,840
The exhibit was put into storage
when the war began.

292
00:24:55,927 --> 00:25:01,001
- OK, what was in the exhibit?
- Trinkets from the original Goa'uld sites -

293
00:25:01,087 --> 00:25:04,557
- pottery, statues.
- What about tablets?

294
00:25:05,487 --> 00:25:07,637
Those were classified top secret

295
00:25:07,727 --> 00:25:11,276
and given to the scientists
working on our Naquadria project.

296
00:25:11,367 --> 00:25:13,722
I'd like to see a list of exhibit objects.

297
00:25:13,807 --> 00:25:16,560
Anubis is looking for something.
I wanna know what.

298
00:25:19,407 --> 00:25:22,319
Cargo bay should be down the next hall.
How's your arm?

299
00:25:22,407 --> 00:25:24,398
I can wiggle my fingers.

300
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:34,880
Those were all the Jaffa going into
the cargo bay, which is just down the hall.

301
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:45,518
Eight men!

302
00:25:46,727 --> 00:25:49,116
That's all you brought?

303
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,639
Eight good men.

304
00:25:52,727 --> 00:25:56,322
There are over 1,000 alien soldiers
in the city.

305
00:25:56,407 --> 00:26:00,605
Their weapons are more powerful
than anything our forces have ever seen.

306
00:26:00,687 --> 00:26:04,726
- We don't stand a chance.
- The main problem is the ship.

307
00:26:04,807 --> 00:26:07,640
Once that's taken out,
we can deal with the Jaffa.

308
00:26:07,727 --> 00:26:11,481
Sir, I think I know
why Anubis hasn't left yet.

309
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:14,206
He's looking for a crystal.

310
00:26:14,287 --> 00:26:18,200
The Kelownan archaeologists found it,
but they didn't know what it was.

311
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:21,916
They classified it as a decorative object
and put it in the museum.

312
00:26:22,007 --> 00:26:24,123
I don't understand. What is it?

313
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:26,801
The Goa'uld use crystals
to store information.

314
00:26:26,887 --> 00:26:28,718
What information?

315
00:26:28,807 --> 00:26:33,927
The original Goa'uld who occupied this
planet was experimenting with Naquadria,

316
00:26:34,007 --> 00:26:37,477
but there are no details -
no lab notes, no test results.

317
00:26:37,567 --> 00:26:41,116
- You think that's what's on the crystal?
- It makes sense.

318
00:26:41,207 --> 00:26:45,644
Your people, not knowing its importance,
never included it with the other material.

319
00:26:45,727 --> 00:26:47,843
That's why Jonas never knew of it.

320
00:26:47,927 --> 00:26:53,240
Sir, if Anubis gets ahold of this crystal, he
could use it to make the Naquadria work.

321
00:26:53,327 --> 00:26:56,080
Yeah, I get it.

322
00:26:56,167 --> 00:27:00,763
- Where is it?
- Everything was moved to a warehouse.

323
00:27:00,847 --> 00:27:03,441
- I can take you there.
- Wait!

324
00:27:04,007 --> 00:27:08,956
If this is as important as you say, let me
send a contingent to secure the building.

325
00:27:09,047 --> 00:27:12,926
We don't want to draw
any unnecessary attention to the place.

326
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:15,680
I'll go, sir. I know what to look for.

327
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,758
All right. Take Teal'c.

328
00:28:03,647 --> 00:28:05,922
Looks like patrols are closing in.

329
00:28:06,007 --> 00:28:10,478
And we've got one minute
before the isotope wears off.

330
00:28:12,487 --> 00:28:17,481
That planet you guys found me on was
nice - people were simple, life was quiet.

331
00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:21,446
- Why didn't you stay?
- I couldn't remember what this was like.

332
00:28:21,527 --> 00:28:23,279
It's fun, isn't it?

333
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:25,358
Yeah.

334
00:28:25,927 --> 00:28:29,158
- If we get out of this...
- You can keep the office.

335
00:28:29,247 --> 00:28:31,715
Actually, I was talking about SG-1.

336
00:28:32,567 --> 00:28:36,082
You took the position cos
you felt guilty about what happened to me

337
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:38,886
and thought you'd make up for it
by finishing my work...

338
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:43,119
- I love the job.
- Who'd argue? Bad hours, constant peril.

339
00:28:43,207 --> 00:28:47,246
On the bright side,
you do get to travel a lot.

340
00:28:49,207 --> 00:28:51,596
- You're very up.
- Yeah.

341
00:28:53,327 --> 00:28:59,357
Truth is, I don't think that Colonel O'Neill
was very comfortable having me around.

342
00:28:59,447 --> 00:29:02,564
That's not what he told me.
He said you were a good man.

343
00:29:02,647 --> 00:29:07,721
- Really? He said that?
- Yeah. You're shocked he never let on?

344
00:29:09,727 --> 00:29:12,366
Anyway, now that you're back...

345
00:29:12,447 --> 00:29:15,757
Let's worry about getting out of here first.

346
00:29:15,847 --> 00:29:19,396
- Rings?
- What good's that? Nowhere to ring to.

347
00:29:19,487 --> 00:29:22,081
We found a ring platform
when we found the gate.

348
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:28,242
- So it hasn't been used in 2,000 years.
- Well, let's see if it still works.

349
00:29:51,367 --> 00:29:53,756
Looks like we got here first.

350
00:30:02,607 --> 00:30:03,801
Jaffa, kree!

351
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:10,156
Two unauthorised personnel detected
on sensors approaching your sector.

352
00:30:25,047 --> 00:30:28,835
- This is hopeless.
- It has to be here somewhere.

353
00:30:32,967 --> 00:30:34,559
Major Carter.

354
00:30:37,607 --> 00:30:39,757
Bingo.

355
00:30:42,327 --> 00:30:44,318
Jaffa, kree!

356
00:30:48,767 --> 00:30:50,519
Shel-norak.

357
00:31:00,327 --> 00:31:04,206
- Do we know where it is we're going?
- Not a clue.

358
00:31:10,927 --> 00:31:12,918
Gal a'quel.

359
00:31:17,327 --> 00:31:18,726
Argh!

360
00:31:34,247 --> 00:31:36,238
- Nice timing.
- Thanks.

361
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:39,444
- Jonas Quinn.
- Ambassador.

362
00:31:39,527 --> 00:31:41,119
- Where are we?
- Warehouse,

363
00:31:41,207 --> 00:31:44,756
where they keep Goa'uld artefacts,
including a ring platform.

364
00:31:44,847 --> 00:31:49,841
- And a crystal.
- Let's go. There's more Jaffa on our tails.

365
00:31:53,887 --> 00:31:58,836
Perimeter's clear. We've a visual on Major
Robbin's position across the square.

366
00:31:58,927 --> 00:32:02,124
OK, Sergeant. Sit tight. O'Neill out.

367
00:32:03,007 --> 00:32:05,202
- Colonel.
- Hey.

368
00:32:07,087 --> 00:32:11,080
- Where'd you find them?
- They dropped into the warehouse.

369
00:32:11,167 --> 00:32:14,637
- Nice. The crystal?
- Right here.

370
00:32:14,727 --> 00:32:16,843
I'll take that.

371
00:32:16,927 --> 00:32:22,524
- I think it'd be better if we held onto it.
- I'm afraid I must insist.

372
00:32:44,847 --> 00:32:46,838
What is this?

373
00:32:46,927 --> 00:32:49,361
I've made a separate arrangement.

374
00:32:53,727 --> 00:32:59,563
Put down your weapons, Colonel,
or I will be forced to destroy these people.

375
00:33:15,247 --> 00:33:17,238
The crystal.

376
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:22,516
You're an idiot, you know that?

377
00:33:22,607 --> 00:33:27,237
In exchange for this, Anubis has agreed
to leave Kelownan territory untouched.

378
00:33:27,327 --> 00:33:30,399
Thus confirming my last statement.

379
00:33:30,487 --> 00:33:33,479
He knows our Naquadria supplies
are depleted,

380
00:33:33,567 --> 00:33:37,116
but I believe he may find
another mine on Tiranian territory.

381
00:33:37,207 --> 00:33:39,198
That's a lie.

382
00:33:39,287 --> 00:33:41,926
One of your scientists is a Kelownan spy.

383
00:33:42,007 --> 00:33:45,397
You've been trying to build a bomb
for the last three years.

384
00:33:45,487 --> 00:33:49,639
But we didn't mine the Naquadria.
We stole it from the Andaris.

385
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:51,126
What?

386
00:33:51,207 --> 00:33:54,438
Don't you see what's happening here?

387
00:33:54,527 --> 00:33:56,882
- He's using you against each other.
- Enough!

388
00:33:56,967 --> 00:34:01,438
You can't afford to fight. This planet
is a target, not just Kelowna or Tirania.

389
00:34:01,527 --> 00:34:05,281
- You have to stand together.
- I said enough!

390
00:34:12,847 --> 00:34:16,806
You've gotta start trusting each other,
or you're all gonna become slaves.

391
00:34:16,887 --> 00:34:18,923
If you're lucky.

392
00:34:22,287 --> 00:34:24,278
The crystal.

393
00:34:28,447 --> 00:34:30,722
Thank you.

394
00:34:49,407 --> 00:34:51,875
As for the rest of you,

395
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:58,645
you'll be publicly executed, as an example
to all those who would defy their god.

396
00:35:01,367 --> 00:35:04,359
Does it have to be publicly?

397
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,398
I could kill you now.

398
00:35:13,087 --> 00:35:15,078
Publicly's fine.

399
00:35:17,447 --> 00:35:19,438
Jaffa!

400
00:35:52,447 --> 00:35:54,483
Aargh!

401
00:36:02,607 --> 00:36:04,598
Tel nor, hatak mal shee.

402
00:36:34,887 --> 00:36:38,243
Your ship is at my mercy.
You are defeated.

403
00:36:38,327 --> 00:36:40,318
Surrender now.

404
00:36:55,527 --> 00:36:57,802
Jaffa, kree!

405
00:36:57,887 --> 00:36:59,718
Daniel!

406
00:37:02,167 --> 00:37:03,566
Argh!

407
00:37:16,207 --> 00:37:18,198
Jonas!

408
00:37:21,287 --> 00:37:23,084
Agh!

409
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,483
I owe you one.

410
00:37:26,567 --> 00:37:29,001
We'll call it even.

411
00:37:46,487 --> 00:37:50,162
The last time you returned to Kelowna,
you were considered a traitor.

412
00:37:50,247 --> 00:37:53,842
- That will not be the case this time.
- Are you sure?

413
00:37:53,927 --> 00:37:57,681
The Andaris and Tiranians
only participated in a joint ruling council

414
00:37:57,767 --> 00:38:00,520
on condition you were
the Kelownan representative.

415
00:38:00,607 --> 00:38:07,160
Your year's experiences will be vital to our
planet facing what awaits in our future.

416
00:38:07,247 --> 00:38:09,238
We need you, Jonas.

417
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:14,475
Got everything packed?
Toothbrush, slippers, hair gel?

418
00:38:15,207 --> 00:38:17,198
Yes.

419
00:38:22,087 --> 00:38:23,600
Sir.

420
00:38:23,687 --> 00:38:26,804
- It was an honour, son.
- Yes, it was.

421
00:38:30,607 --> 00:38:36,045
When we first met you told me that
the issues between my planet's nations

422
00:38:36,127 --> 00:38:41,599
would seem insignificant once I found out
what was really going on up there.

423
00:38:41,687 --> 00:38:43,917
- Yeah, I remember that.
- You do?

424
00:38:44,007 --> 00:38:45,804
- Yeah.
- That's great.

425
00:38:45,887 --> 00:38:48,447
It's all kind of coming back.

426
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:52,361
- I'm glad I had the chance to find out.
- Me, too.

427
00:38:58,447 --> 00:39:02,122
You have the heart of a warrior,
Jonas Quinn.

428
00:39:03,767 --> 00:39:05,598
Continue to fight well.

429
00:39:11,207 --> 00:39:13,198
Keep in touch.

430
00:39:18,247 --> 00:39:19,236
Uh...

431
00:39:19,327 --> 00:39:21,522
You earned it.

432
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:30,358
Thanks.

433
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:38,598
Hey, Daniel.

434
00:39:38,687 --> 00:39:40,678
Feed my fish?

435
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:19,036
- You all right?
- Yeah.

436
00:40:21,087 --> 00:40:23,601
Well, dinner's at seven. Don't be late.

437
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:28,477
Teal'c gets a little cranky
when his blood sugar gets low.

438
00:40:28,567 --> 00:40:31,365
- Jack.
- Yeah?

439
00:40:31,447 --> 00:40:36,601
It's not that I mind rejoining SG-1
and exploring the galaxy,

440
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:42,523
meeting new cultures, jeopardy,
saving the world - that kind of thing.

441
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,201
We get paid for this, right?

442
00:40:49,407 --> 00:40:51,796
Welcome back.
