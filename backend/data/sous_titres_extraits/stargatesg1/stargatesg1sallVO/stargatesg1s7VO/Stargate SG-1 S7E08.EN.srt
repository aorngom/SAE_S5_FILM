1
00:00:19,007 --> 00:00:22,397
Sorry I haven't changed, sir.
The message said it was urgent.

2
00:00:22,487 --> 00:00:25,399
Hello again, Major Carter.

3
00:00:25,487 --> 00:00:27,284
Warrick.

4
00:00:28,127 --> 00:00:31,722
- It's good to see you again.
- You too. What brings you here?

5
00:00:31,807 --> 00:00:36,278
When last we spoke, you reiterated your
desire for access to Serrakin technology.

6
00:00:36,367 --> 00:00:37,800
Yes, of course.

7
00:00:37,887 --> 00:00:43,166
Yet diplomacy between our respective
leadership has been slow to develop.

8
00:00:43,247 --> 00:00:48,002
- I'm sure they're just being cautious.
- As I told Hammond and Dr Jackson,

9
00:00:48,087 --> 00:00:52,365
I am here to offer you full access to
the ion propulsion engine on the Seberus.

10
00:00:52,447 --> 00:00:54,244
Well, that's great.

11
00:00:54,327 --> 00:00:56,921
- Sir, this could...
- I read your report, Major.

12
00:00:57,007 --> 00:01:01,398
I won't debate the value of the technology,
but there's more.

13
00:01:03,047 --> 00:01:06,119
In return, I would like your help...

14
00:01:06,207 --> 00:01:08,596
to win a race.

15
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:14,164
It is called the Loop of Kon Garat.

16
00:02:14,247 --> 00:02:18,206
Every year, the largest corporation
on my planet, known as Tech Con Group,

17
00:02:18,287 --> 00:02:22,963
awards an extremely lucrative contract
to the winner of the Loop.

18
00:02:23,047 --> 00:02:25,686
A contract?

19
00:02:25,767 --> 00:02:30,522
It is a time-tested method to find the most
able pilot with the best ship for the job.

20
00:02:30,607 --> 00:02:33,201
The race is open to anyone.
There are few rules.

21
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:36,165
The winner's ship
must arrive first and intact.

22
00:02:36,247 --> 00:02:40,559
The government of your planet is letting
you share advanced technology with us

23
00:02:40,647 --> 00:02:44,242
in exchange for us
helping you to win a race?

24
00:02:45,487 --> 00:02:47,284
Not exactly.

25
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:51,838
I have arranged for a small group of you
to come to Hebridan on a diplomatic visit.

26
00:02:51,927 --> 00:02:54,805
There is no rule
preventing you from helping me,

27
00:02:54,887 --> 00:02:57,162
and what you learn while you're there...

28
00:02:57,247 --> 00:02:59,920
So, unofficially.

29
00:03:00,727 --> 00:03:03,639
- How can we help?
- Major!

30
00:03:03,727 --> 00:03:06,719
Can't hurt to ask, can it, sir?

31
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:12,203
The power you used to recharge
the Seberus when I was stranded...

32
00:03:12,287 --> 00:03:16,200
- A naqahdah generator.
- The Seberus has been through a lot.

33
00:03:16,287 --> 00:03:20,439
But my diagnostic analysis of its systems
showed greatly improved efficiency

34
00:03:20,527 --> 00:03:23,121
when supplemented
by the naqahdah generator.

35
00:03:23,207 --> 00:03:25,277
I'd like to participate.

36
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:31,641
Well, actually,
I was not asking you to join me.

37
00:03:31,727 --> 00:03:34,400
Why not? I'll have to
interface the generator.

38
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:36,955
Could you not just show me?

39
00:03:37,047 --> 00:03:41,165
Naqahdah generators are valuable to us.
We won't let one out of our sight.

40
00:03:41,247 --> 00:03:44,444
Besides, you never know
what issues could arise on the fly.

41
00:03:44,527 --> 00:03:48,281
I feel compelled to warn you of
the danger. It's not for the fainthearted.

42
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:52,076
We take risks to attain
advanced technology all the time.

43
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:57,844
For me, there'd be no better way to learn
about your ship than to see it in action.

44
00:03:57,927 --> 00:04:00,202
A victory would mean a great deal to me.

45
00:04:00,287 --> 00:04:03,279
I am not above accepting your offer.

46
00:04:04,247 --> 00:04:06,715
With your approval, sir.

47
00:04:08,487 --> 00:04:13,003
Major, I expect you to evaluate the risk
of this mission on an ongoing basis

48
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:16,477
- and act accordingly.
- As always, sir.

49
00:04:22,487 --> 00:04:24,842
- Hey.
- Hey.

50
00:04:24,927 --> 00:04:27,725
- You ready?
- Yeah, just about.

51
00:04:27,807 --> 00:04:33,006
Warrick has set us up some meetings with
high-ranking members of his government.

52
00:04:33,087 --> 00:04:37,558
- I bet O'Neill's looking forward to that.
- Oh, yeah.

53
00:04:37,647 --> 00:04:41,435
- You really think this is worth it?
- Absolutely.

54
00:04:41,527 --> 00:04:43,404
Why, don't you?

55
00:04:43,487 --> 00:04:45,364
No... Yeah... I just...

56
00:04:45,447 --> 00:04:49,406
- You just seem unusually gung ho.
- Gung ho?

57
00:04:49,487 --> 00:04:52,877
This is more than about
attaining new technology for you.

58
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:56,164
You mean helping Warrick?
He did once risk his life for me.

59
00:04:56,247 --> 00:04:58,238
Yeah, I heard that.

60
00:04:58,327 --> 00:05:00,363
I think there's something else.

61
00:05:00,447 --> 00:05:04,963
Look, I know that
this could be dangerous,

62
00:05:05,047 --> 00:05:08,244
but this is our job, right?
It's what we signed on to do.

63
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:12,957
We take risks in the hopes of
achieving new levels of technology.

64
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:16,084
If - and I stress "i' -

65
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:21,082
participating in this race
happens to be a little bit, I don't know...

66
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:22,839
Fun?

67
00:05:22,927 --> 00:05:27,796
- What's a girl to do?
- Nothing. That's just what I thought.

68
00:05:33,327 --> 00:05:34,726
I'm Ardal Hadraig.

69
00:05:34,807 --> 00:05:40,598
Welcome back to TCNN's exclusive
coverage of the 59th Loop of Kon Garat.

70
00:05:40,687 --> 00:05:42,882
With the Loop set to begin tomorrow,

71
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:46,403
we have a startling
new development to report.

72
00:05:46,487 --> 00:05:49,399
Perennial also-ran Warrick Finn
announced today

73
00:05:49,487 --> 00:05:54,038
that his copilot will be a human from
the planet we've come to know as Earth.

74
00:05:54,127 --> 00:06:00,441
Major Carter's participation will mark the
first inclusion of an alien in Loop history.

75
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,246
A band of explorers happened upon him

76
00:06:03,327 --> 00:06:07,081
when his ship, the "Seberus",
crashed on an uncharted planet

77
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:10,398
while transporting convicts
to the outlying prison colonies.

78
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:12,955
The question on everyone's mind is

79
00:06:13,047 --> 00:06:17,279
will these earthlings bring Warrick luck
a second time around?

80
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:21,159
Continuing coverage
of the Loop of Kon Garat

81
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:24,717
is brought to you
by Tech Con Ultra Sport Beverage.

82
00:06:24,807 --> 00:06:31,406
When you've got an ultrabig thirst to
quench, only Tech Con Ultra Sport will do.

83
00:06:39,087 --> 00:06:41,726
May I introduce you all to Eamon?

84
00:06:41,807 --> 00:06:45,038
He is responsible for making
the Seberus what it is today.

85
00:06:45,127 --> 00:06:47,641
And he is my younger brother.

86
00:06:47,727 --> 00:06:50,366
Ah, yes. I see the family resemblance.

87
00:06:50,447 --> 00:06:52,677
It's uncanny, boys.

88
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:54,359
It's like...

89
00:06:57,727 --> 00:07:02,039
- Colonel Jack O'Neill. This is...
- You just had to do it, didn't you?

90
00:07:02,127 --> 00:07:03,355
Eamon...

91
00:07:03,447 --> 00:07:07,963
- You think we'd lose without their help?
- Eamon!

92
00:07:08,047 --> 00:07:12,086
They saved my life and are responsible
for my getting back home to Hebridan.

93
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:16,558
- I suggest you show some respect.
- My apologies.

94
00:07:16,647 --> 00:07:20,003
I am honoured to meet
my brother's saviours.

95
00:07:20,087 --> 00:07:25,639
And you must be Major Carter. The one
without whom we could not win the Loop.

96
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:28,560
You know, I feel all warm and fuzzy.
How about you?

97
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:33,482
Major Carter, if you are to be my copilot,
you'll need to know how the ship works.

98
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:36,684
- What is this?
- The operations manual for the Seberus.

99
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:40,157
- I had it translated for you.
- Thank you.

100
00:07:40,247 --> 00:07:42,636
That's not our language.

101
00:07:42,727 --> 00:07:44,763
It's mine, sir.

102
00:07:44,847 --> 00:07:46,838
Right.

103
00:07:47,727 --> 00:07:51,276
The long-range scanner control unit
didn't come in again today.

104
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:54,837
- When I called, they said our credit...
- I will go and pick one up,

105
00:07:54,927 --> 00:08:00,320
after I escort Colonel O'Neill, Dr Jackson
and Teal'c to our capitol building.

106
00:08:00,407 --> 00:08:05,765
- T, you coming?
- Carter requested I remain to assist her.

107
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:09,558
- She did?
- I did?

108
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:12,759
Indeed.

109
00:08:12,847 --> 00:08:15,600
Right. Yes, thank you.

110
00:08:15,687 --> 00:08:19,077
I do not wish to disappoint Major Carter.

111
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,956
Yes, I know the feeling.

112
00:08:24,647 --> 00:08:27,480
- Shall we?
- Stay in touch.

113
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:36,523
- I am in your debt, Major Carter.
- Indeed.

114
00:08:43,487 --> 00:08:48,083
With all your science, I'm surprised you
don't have a power source that rivals this.

115
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:51,921
Oh, they exist.
We just couldn't afford one.

116
00:08:52,007 --> 00:08:53,804
Ah.

117
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:59,041
- Warrick is desperate, Major.
- How do you mean?

118
00:08:59,127 --> 00:09:02,278
He was gone a long time.
We all thought he was dead.

119
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:06,918
His wife, Athea, remarried,
and has children of her own now.

120
00:09:07,007 --> 00:09:09,885
Since his return, work has been scarce.

121
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:15,079
He thinks this race
is his chance to get his life back,

122
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:18,159
and he will do anything to win it.

123
00:09:18,247 --> 00:09:21,239
- What about you?
- Me?

124
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,124
I work for Tech Con.

125
00:09:23,207 --> 00:09:27,564
I design garbage disposal units
for their food service division.

126
00:09:28,087 --> 00:09:29,884
Need I say more?

127
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:33,998
- No.
- Eamon, I'm back.

128
00:09:34,087 --> 00:09:38,160
- Did you get the...
- No. They just transmitted the race data.

129
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:50,205
Tech Con Group - progress
and people working in total harmony.

130
00:09:50,287 --> 00:09:53,996
I'm Miles Hagan,
President of Tech Con Group.

131
00:09:54,087 --> 00:09:58,444
I wish to welcome you as an official
contestant to the Loop of Kon Garat.

132
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,325
Congratulations on qualifying.

133
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:07,719
As always, the Loop will run through
a course that consists of four stages.

134
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:12,642
- Defence...
- We know that. Skip to the competition.

135
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:17,397
Let's meet your fellow pilots, shall we?

136
00:10:20,927 --> 00:10:23,487
I don't believe it. Jarlath.

137
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:25,876
Jarlath?

138
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,765
I know him from my days
of transporting convicts.

139
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:35,602
He was caught running illegal weapons.
I thought he was in prison.

140
00:10:35,687 --> 00:10:41,045
- Looks like he's been paroled.
- He's not our biggest problem.

141
00:10:41,127 --> 00:10:44,961
La'el Montrose, independent cargo runner
from the Parallel Colonies.

142
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:48,722
Her ship is very fast.
And worse still...

143
00:10:52,447 --> 00:10:56,281
- Hm. Muirios.
- His skill as a pilot is legendary.

144
00:10:56,367 --> 00:10:59,325
- Can we beat him?
- You'll lose in the navigation phase

145
00:10:59,407 --> 00:11:02,205
without a long-range scanner control unit.

146
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,676
I will get one.

147
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,038
What's this?

148
00:11:24,207 --> 00:11:26,198
Expensive.

149
00:11:26,967 --> 00:11:30,198
Hello, Warrick. Who's your friend?

150
00:11:30,287 --> 00:11:32,881
Hi. Major Samantha Carter.

151
00:11:32,967 --> 00:11:35,117
Ah, one of the earthlings.

152
00:11:35,207 --> 00:11:37,437
I heard about you.

153
00:11:38,127 --> 00:11:40,436
We're here for the scanner control unit.

154
00:11:40,527 --> 00:11:42,677
- Look, Warrick...
- Taupen.

155
00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:45,201
I'm running a business, not a charity.

156
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:48,165
Your credit's been over
the maximum for months.

157
00:11:48,247 --> 00:11:50,920
The best chance of my paying you back
is for me to win.

158
00:11:51,007 --> 00:11:55,637
I'm sorry, Warrick. I can't give you
a new one, but you're in luck.

159
00:11:55,727 --> 00:12:00,198
I just picked up this
reconditioned unit this morning.

160
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:02,278
It should work fine.

161
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:06,797
I will take it. Thank you.

162
00:12:06,887 --> 00:12:10,846
- I promise. I will settle up things after...
- After you lose.

163
00:12:12,407 --> 00:12:15,717
You don't think he's good for it, do you?

164
00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:19,925
He doesn't stand a chance
of winning the Loop.

165
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:21,838
Jarlath.

166
00:12:21,927 --> 00:12:25,317
Still avoiding personal hygiene, I see.

167
00:12:25,407 --> 00:12:28,399
Who's your friend, Warrick?

168
00:12:28,487 --> 00:12:30,682
She looks nice.

169
00:12:32,047 --> 00:12:38,395
Golon Jarlath, Captain of the Oran,
very much at your service.

170
00:12:38,487 --> 00:12:40,478
Ignore him, Major.

171
00:12:43,087 --> 00:12:48,719
Stay out of my way, Warrick,
or I'll blow your pathetic ship to pieces.

172
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:50,964
Warrick.

173
00:12:53,487 --> 00:12:56,126
You're right. He is not worth it.

174
00:13:03,287 --> 00:13:05,676
That's it. We're done.

175
00:13:05,767 --> 00:13:07,758
She's ready.

176
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:14,005
Do you believe
the Seberus can win this race?

177
00:13:14,087 --> 00:13:19,639
I'd like to think we'd have won without
the naqahdah. With it, I'd guarantee it.

178
00:13:19,727 --> 00:13:21,524
Hungry?

179
00:13:21,607 --> 00:13:23,882
That depends.

180
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:28,040
I'm sure we can find something
that will suit you.

181
00:13:52,087 --> 00:13:55,238
With the Loop set to begin
only minutes from now,

182
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:59,798
I'm joined by race expert
and two-time champion Coyle Boron.

183
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:02,959
Coyle, what's going through
the pilots' minds right now?

184
00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:07,404
Well, at the starting buoys there's nothing
else to do but run your preflight check

185
00:14:07,487 --> 00:14:10,524
and hope all your hard work pays off.
It's a tense time.

186
00:14:10,607 --> 00:14:13,075
There's no question the stakes are high.

187
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:15,635
The winner receives
a lucrative contract

188
00:14:15,727 --> 00:14:18,446
with Tech Con's
deep-space-exploration project,

189
00:14:18,527 --> 00:14:23,806
while anything else means massive debt
and the acrid taste of bitter defeat.

190
00:14:23,887 --> 00:14:27,721
It's an interesting group of pilots this year,
Coyle. Who do you like?

191
00:14:27,807 --> 00:14:30,037
You gotta like this kid Muirios.

192
00:14:30,127 --> 00:14:33,164
He's got the talent
and the ship to take it all.

193
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:37,445
What about Warrick and the human
woman? Any potential for an upset?

194
00:14:37,527 --> 00:14:39,961
They don't stand a chance.

195
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:43,926
Well, the gaming experts agree.
You can wager on the outcome

196
00:14:44,007 --> 00:14:46,805
at any of Tech Con Group's
friendly gaming kiosks,

197
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:50,004
conveniently located
throughout urban centres near you.

198
00:14:50,087 --> 00:14:54,922
Tech Con Gaming Kiosks -
if you don't play, you definitely won't win.

199
00:14:56,887 --> 00:15:01,085
I'm getting the feeling that even
a long look at an ion drive isn't enough.

200
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:06,639
We'll need a compression coil to have any
chance of reproducing the technology.

201
00:15:06,727 --> 00:15:09,002
If we win, I'll buy you one.

202
00:15:09,087 --> 00:15:10,998
If we win?

203
00:15:11,087 --> 00:15:15,603
Prepare for race start.
All pilots check in now.

204
00:15:15,687 --> 00:15:20,966
Flight Control, this is the Seberus,
preparing for race start.

205
00:15:23,127 --> 00:15:27,484
- What do you want, Jarlath?
- Just to tell you to drop out now

206
00:15:27,567 --> 00:15:33,403
and save that worthless junk barge you
call a ship from being destroyed.

207
00:15:33,487 --> 00:15:37,685
- Eat greeven, Jarlath.
- You piece of...

208
00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:40,679
- Greeven?
- Don't ask.

209
00:15:40,767 --> 00:15:45,795
This is Tech Con Flight Control.
Stand by for race start.

210
00:15:45,887 --> 00:15:47,843
Ready or not,

211
00:15:47,927 --> 00:15:50,680
here... we... go.

212
00:15:59,007 --> 00:16:03,080
The first stage is a test
of each ship's defence capabilities.

213
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:04,759
Against what?

214
00:16:15,327 --> 00:16:18,399
- Those things are firing at us.
- Yes.

215
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:29,478
Bring aft shields to full.

216
00:16:30,527 --> 00:16:33,485
- That is auxiliary power.
- Right.

217
00:16:37,407 --> 00:16:40,683
- Shields are holding.
- Captain Shibo of the "Tritan".

218
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:43,440
Losing shield power.
Key systems are failing.

219
00:16:43,527 --> 00:16:45,722
Tritan, this is Warrick on the Seberus.

220
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:49,800
Siphon primary power from your regulator
and boost your shield strength.

221
00:16:49,887 --> 00:16:52,082
I can't. I've lost my interchange unit.

222
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:53,600
I...

223
00:16:53,687 --> 00:16:56,201
Tritan, hold on.
We're on our way to assist.

224
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:04,275
Too late. My engines are fried.
I'm out, Warrick. Thanks anyway.

225
00:17:04,367 --> 00:17:08,326
- Is he gonna be OK?
- Drones cease firing if a ship is disabled.

226
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:20,356
That's it, we're clear.

227
00:17:20,447 --> 00:17:22,677
Anyone ever die in this race?

228
00:17:22,767 --> 00:17:25,520
- I told you it was dangerous.
- I know.

229
00:17:25,607 --> 00:17:29,361
Are there no events such as this on Earth
where humans risk their lives?

230
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:33,360
- Yeah, a few.
- No matter how much winning may mean,

231
00:17:33,447 --> 00:17:36,519
I'd never intentionally
endanger your life. This ship...

232
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:41,120
- What now? I thought we were clear.
- Stage two.

233
00:17:41,207 --> 00:17:43,801
We're entering
the coronasphere of our sun.

234
00:17:43,887 --> 00:17:48,358
It disturbs the communication
and navigation equipment.

235
00:17:48,447 --> 00:17:52,645
Eamon has designed shielding
specifically for this phase.

236
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:56,684
And so, after stage one,
Muirios has the lead,

237
00:17:56,767 --> 00:18:00,646
followed closely by
La'el Montrose and Golon Jarlath.

238
00:18:00,727 --> 00:18:03,161
The "Oran" made quick work
of those drones.

239
00:18:03,247 --> 00:18:07,035
- We've got stage two coming up fast.
- That would be the coronasphere.

240
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:11,757
It's made up of ionised gases, so you
fly though a layer of translucent plasma.

241
00:18:11,847 --> 00:18:16,557
- Wow. Sounds hot.
- At this stage it's all about the shields.

242
00:18:16,647 --> 00:18:20,037
Does your ship have what it takes
to survive that intense heat?

243
00:18:20,127 --> 00:18:22,925
- And if it doesn't?
- You'd be instantly vaporised.

244
00:18:23,007 --> 00:18:26,204
Interesting. In a horrifying sense/

245
00:18:26,287 --> 00:18:29,597
If you have a loved one
who's close to death, don't delay.

246
00:18:29,687 --> 00:18:32,520
Contact Tech Con Group
Funeral Services today

247
00:18:32,607 --> 00:18:35,724
and make your loved one's farewell
memorable beyond words.

248
00:18:35,807 --> 00:18:40,323
Tech Con Group Funeral Services -
helping you make peace with death.

249
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:52,355
- Initiating coronaspheric shielding.
- Communication systems are inoperative.

250
00:18:52,447 --> 00:18:54,244
They will come back.

251
00:18:59,087 --> 00:19:01,317
- What's going on?
- I do not know.

252
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:04,080
We are losing engine power.

253
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,486
Teal'c, Eamon.

254
00:19:06,567 --> 00:19:12,722
We are sending a distress signal.
Our key systems are inoperative.

255
00:19:12,807 --> 00:19:15,560
- Engines are failing.
- How does one respond?

256
00:19:15,647 --> 00:19:17,763
Here.

257
00:19:17,847 --> 00:19:20,645
- Major Carter, come in.
- We can no longer maintain...

258
00:19:22,807 --> 00:19:25,526
They've lost all primary power.

259
00:19:26,487 --> 00:19:28,842
They're in trouble.

260
00:19:29,647 --> 00:19:34,323
Auxiliary power will not engage.
We are on emergency storage cells.

261
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:38,559
- What are you doing?
- The blast shields will block the radiation.

262
00:19:38,647 --> 00:19:41,639
So much for not risking your life.

263
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:56,725
- What happened?
- The power diverter overloaded.

264
00:19:56,807 --> 00:19:59,275
- Can you fix it?
- No.

265
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:03,201
Major Carter, Captain Warrick,
do you read me?

266
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:06,245
- We're here. Can you hear us?
- Are you all right?

267
00:20:06,327 --> 00:20:08,477
The power diverter overloaded.

268
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:12,242
Impossible. I ran a full diagnostic
three hours before the race.

269
00:20:12,327 --> 00:20:13,646
Unless...

270
00:20:13,727 --> 00:20:15,524
Unless what?

271
00:20:17,207 --> 00:20:21,723
It's hard to tell with all the damage, but
if someone cut the link to the system...

272
00:20:21,807 --> 00:20:25,880
- Somebody did this on purpose?
- They'd need knowledge of the systems.

273
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:30,119
I think they knew exactly where to hit us
and how to cover their tracks.

274
00:20:30,207 --> 00:20:34,086
- Eamon, we're being pulled to the sun.
- I know.

275
00:20:35,407 --> 00:20:41,118
Bypass the diverter and manually regulate
power to the engines with the accelerator.

276
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:47,520
- It's dangerous.
- More dangerous than flying into a sun?

277
00:20:47,607 --> 00:20:51,839
We have to reconnect the naqahdah
generator in order to bypass the diverter

278
00:20:51,927 --> 00:20:54,680
and supply power directly to the engines.

279
00:20:55,527 --> 00:20:58,519
- How much time do we have?
- Not much.

280
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:06,366
And so, out of the ten ships
that started the Loop, only six remain.

281
00:21:06,447 --> 00:21:09,086
And that number
may soon dwindle to five.

282
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:13,922
For those of you just joining us, all
I can say is where have you been hiding?

283
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:18,159
Warrick Finn and his alien copilot
have slipped back into last place.

284
00:21:18,247 --> 00:21:21,796
- They ran into trouble during stage two.
- That's right, Ardal.

285
00:21:21,887 --> 00:21:24,959
Latest updates place them
dangerously close to the sun.

286
00:21:25,047 --> 00:21:28,926
Warrick must be disappointed to be
facing certain defeat so early in the race.

287
00:21:29,007 --> 00:21:32,920
You got that right. This is the moment
where every pilot has to dig deep

288
00:21:33,007 --> 00:21:37,205
in that reservoir of desire and fortitude
if they want to win.

289
00:21:37,287 --> 00:21:42,236
It sounds like maybe they could use
a couple of bottles of Radon Shield 55,

290
00:21:42,327 --> 00:21:44,158
new from Tech Con Cosmetics.

291
00:21:44,247 --> 00:21:49,037
Radon Shield 55 protects you and your
whole family from the sun's radiation.

292
00:21:49,127 --> 00:21:55,123
Day in, day out, Radon Shield 55 keeps
your fun factor up and lesion count down.

293
00:21:55,207 --> 00:21:59,200
Available at quality Tech Con
family outlets everywhere.

294
00:22:04,927 --> 00:22:08,715
Someone must have snuck in here,
got into the ship.

295
00:22:08,807 --> 00:22:11,321
- Who would know the ship well enough?
- No one.

296
00:22:11,407 --> 00:22:15,605
The Seberus is a common model,
but I've customised it significantly.

297
00:22:15,687 --> 00:22:19,885
Unless someone accessed the schematics
on my computer at Tech Con.

298
00:22:23,047 --> 00:22:25,038
I'm done.

299
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:27,878
Me too.

300
00:22:32,407 --> 00:22:35,558
- Let's hope this works.
- If it doesn't?

301
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:39,435
We fall into the sun and burn up,
or worse.

302
00:22:39,527 --> 00:22:42,166
- Worse?
- We could explode right now.

303
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:44,400
Oh.

304
00:22:45,327 --> 00:22:47,318
Here goes.

305
00:22:51,887 --> 00:22:53,559
Let's get out of here.

306
00:22:57,327 --> 00:23:00,444
Teal'c, we've got
the power back online.

307
00:23:00,527 --> 00:23:03,405
That is good to hear, Major Carter.

308
00:23:05,647 --> 00:23:08,207
- I can't believe it.
- What is it?

309
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:12,724
- Someone did access my computer.
- Who?

310
00:23:12,807 --> 00:23:16,197
His name is Del Tynan.
He's my supervisor.

311
00:23:16,287 --> 00:23:18,357
I can't tell exactly what he got.

312
00:23:18,447 --> 00:23:21,837
If we're gonna prove anything,
we need to go to Tech Con.

313
00:23:21,927 --> 00:23:26,717
They won't let you in without clearance.
You'll need a hat.

314
00:23:27,567 --> 00:23:31,446
Three more ships have pulled out,
and we've fallen far behind the others.

315
00:23:31,527 --> 00:23:35,361
If you wish we can drop out now
and avoid any further risk.

316
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:42,684
Carter? You there?

317
00:23:42,767 --> 00:23:44,439
Colonel, sir.

318
00:23:44,527 --> 00:23:47,200
I got it to work.
How's it going up there?

319
00:23:47,287 --> 00:23:49,562
We had some trouble, but we're fine now.

320
00:23:49,647 --> 00:23:52,764
- You sure?
- Yeah. How's it going down there?

321
00:23:52,847 --> 00:23:56,442
Uh, good. We're gonna
help them bring a Stargate here.

322
00:23:56,527 --> 00:23:59,599
In exchange, we get an ion drive to study.

323
00:23:59,687 --> 00:24:04,283
- Really?
- Yes. So no need to take any chances.

324
00:24:05,407 --> 00:24:07,443
I made a deal. I'm sticking with it.

325
00:24:07,527 --> 00:24:10,758
Oh, having fun are we, Carter?

326
00:24:13,807 --> 00:24:16,924
Um, gotta go.
We're pretty far behind at this point.

327
00:24:17,007 --> 00:24:19,521
All right. Be careful.

328
00:24:19,607 --> 00:24:22,804
- We will. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

329
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:32,918
OK. If we use the gravity of the sun to
slingshot us around back onto the course,

330
00:24:33,007 --> 00:24:36,204
we could pick up enough speed
to get back into the race.

331
00:24:36,287 --> 00:24:37,686
Brilliant.

332
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,398
- Hi, Eamon.
- Hello.

333
00:24:56,007 --> 00:24:57,918
This is my cousin...

334
00:24:58,007 --> 00:25:00,202
- Murray.
- Mm. Twice removed.

335
00:25:00,287 --> 00:25:03,006
I just forgot a data unit in my office.
Won't be long.

336
00:25:03,087 --> 00:25:06,079
You have to scan in. Company policy.

337
00:25:10,607 --> 00:25:14,805
- Sorry your brother isn't doing very well.
- Oh, me too.

338
00:25:14,887 --> 00:25:17,276
Nice to meet you, Murray.

339
00:25:25,687 --> 00:25:29,475
- This is Tynan's office.
- Does he not keep his office secure?

340
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:33,765
The company philosophy
encourages mutual trust.

341
00:25:36,967 --> 00:25:40,642
Besides, no one is
going to steal his plants.

342
00:25:41,927 --> 00:25:46,523
Everything of value is in here. The system
is protected by a secret pass code.

343
00:25:46,607 --> 00:25:48,837
Fortunately,
I put a program on my system

344
00:25:48,927 --> 00:25:53,079
that records an intruder's pass code
if someone attempts to access my files.

345
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:56,876
Then it is good you do not subscribe
to the company philosophy.

346
00:25:56,967 --> 00:25:58,844
Mm.

347
00:26:05,487 --> 00:26:09,116
This is an automated
distress signal. The following pilot:

348
00:26:09,207 --> 00:26:11,767
- Jarlath.
...is in need of assistance.

349
00:26:11,847 --> 00:26:13,644
Current status is:

350
00:26:13,727 --> 00:26:17,402
Die, you rotting scrap ofjetsam/

351
00:26:22,527 --> 00:26:26,998
This is worse than I thought. He has
schematics for every ship in the race.

352
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:30,204
For the purpose of
sabotaging the competition.

353
00:26:33,847 --> 00:26:35,644
But not this one.

354
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:39,003
It has boosters from
Tech Con's prototype division.

355
00:26:39,087 --> 00:26:41,476
A private-sector pilot could not buy these.

356
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:44,559
- To whom does that ship belong?
- Muirios.

357
00:26:44,647 --> 00:26:46,638
Tynan has set him up to win.

358
00:26:46,727 --> 00:26:48,922
We have to warn Warrick.

359
00:26:50,047 --> 00:26:52,436
I don't think so.

360
00:27:04,047 --> 00:27:09,599
Oran, this is the Seberus responding to
your distress call. Jarlath, do you read?

361
00:27:09,687 --> 00:27:13,316
- Warrick?
- We're close by. What is your status?

362
00:27:13,407 --> 00:27:17,002
My status is mind your own business.

363
00:27:18,087 --> 00:27:23,161
- You sent out a distress call.
- No, my computer did. Everything is fine.

364
00:27:23,247 --> 00:27:26,523
Transmission indicates
your life support is failing.

365
00:27:26,607 --> 00:27:28,598
My oxygen supply vented.

366
00:27:28,687 --> 00:27:32,600
That is what you get for having no shields.
The drones must have caused a leak.

367
00:27:32,687 --> 00:27:36,202
Shut up, Warrick.
Go back to losing the race.

368
00:27:38,327 --> 00:27:40,397
You'll die if you don't let us help.

369
00:27:40,487 --> 00:27:42,876
I don't need help, least of all from you.

370
00:27:42,967 --> 00:27:45,606
What about emergency reserves?

371
00:27:45,687 --> 00:27:49,236
I don't have any.
I needed the room for additional weapons.

372
00:27:49,327 --> 00:27:51,124
Imbecile.

373
00:27:51,207 --> 00:27:56,759
I would rather die kissing space debris
than board that barge you call a ship.

374
00:27:59,207 --> 00:28:02,244
He does not want to be rescued.

375
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:05,444
Jarlath, hold on. We'll be there soon.

376
00:28:34,647 --> 00:28:36,797
I am not coming up there.

377
00:28:36,887 --> 00:28:38,878
We tried.

378
00:28:39,687 --> 00:28:41,086
Come on!

379
00:28:50,087 --> 00:28:52,999
Can you move any slower?

380
00:28:53,087 --> 00:28:55,555
You don't think you can still win, do you?

381
00:28:55,647 --> 00:28:59,276
We are only this far behind
because we were sabotaged.

382
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:04,998
A likely excuse.

383
00:29:05,927 --> 00:29:09,317
- So was I, by the way.
- How so?

384
00:29:09,407 --> 00:29:13,082
The drones didn't cause the leak
in my life support. I was never hit.

385
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:17,240
- Somebody fixed the whole race?
- It is not over yet.

386
00:29:17,327 --> 00:29:19,443
What planet do you live on?

387
00:29:20,847 --> 00:29:24,044
Told you we should have left him to die.

388
00:29:25,247 --> 00:29:30,162
Teal'c, do you read?
Teal'c, you still at Tech Con?

389
00:29:33,447 --> 00:29:36,678
This is unfortunate.
You were a good employee, Eamon.

390
00:29:36,767 --> 00:29:39,918
- How could you do this?
- How could I?

391
00:29:40,007 --> 00:29:42,123
How could I not?

392
00:29:42,207 --> 00:29:47,327
Your new friend here doesn't want you
to know the Serrakin are not to be trusted.

393
00:29:47,407 --> 00:29:50,205
The Serrakin freed your ancestors
from the Goa'uld.

394
00:29:50,287 --> 00:29:55,202
For what purpose, hm?
Sharing technology? Living in harmony?

395
00:29:55,287 --> 00:29:56,879
All lies.

396
00:29:56,967 --> 00:30:00,562
The Serrakin are seizing control
of our world, piece by piece,

397
00:30:00,647 --> 00:30:04,003
taking power and opportunity away
from pureblood humans,

398
00:30:04,087 --> 00:30:08,638
polluting our race by crossbreeding,
weakening it, by design.

399
00:30:08,727 --> 00:30:12,356
Don't you see? The Serrakin
are no better than the Goa'uld.

400
00:30:12,447 --> 00:30:18,716
This is insane. Our society was built by
both races, for the good of all Hebridians.

401
00:30:18,807 --> 00:30:21,799
Is that why Serrakin
hold all the highest positions

402
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:24,321
and humans are like
second-class citizens?

403
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:26,398
That's not true!

404
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:28,726
When Hagan finds out...

405
00:30:28,807 --> 00:30:33,676
Hagan is one of the primary architects
of human oppression on this planet.

406
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:39,046
The winner of the Loop will be a pure
human. And that's merely the first step.

407
00:30:39,127 --> 00:30:44,281
You're just mad because you've been
passed over for advancement three times.

408
00:30:44,367 --> 00:30:48,360
You think I'm the only one? There are
enough of us to make a difference.

409
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:52,759
Has it occurred to you maybe the reason
you've been passed over so many times

410
00:30:52,847 --> 00:30:57,477
is not because you're a human,
but because you're a moron?

411
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:04,957
I am doing this to save my kind
from the likes of you.

412
00:31:13,087 --> 00:31:15,078
I guess not.

413
00:31:18,967 --> 00:31:25,236
Welcome back to TCNN's continuing
coverage of the Loop of Kon Garat.

414
00:31:25,327 --> 00:31:27,557
We have startling developments.

415
00:31:27,647 --> 00:31:32,641
Warrick and Samantha Carter have
re-entered the race with a vengeance,

416
00:31:32,727 --> 00:31:35,287
and are now pulling into
a close third position.

417
00:31:35,367 --> 00:31:39,883
- What does this mean for Muirios?
- He's had a commanding lead throughout.

418
00:31:39,967 --> 00:31:44,518
He's gotta be wondering what Warrick has
that let him make up that distance so fast.

419
00:31:44,607 --> 00:31:48,600
Well, Coyle, perhaps he's using Ion Pro,
a new engine additive

420
00:31:48,687 --> 00:31:51,281
- from Tech Con Propulsion Systems.
- Perhaps.

421
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:56,236
Ion Pro is guaranteed to improve drive
performance, whatever class ship you fly.

422
00:31:56,327 --> 00:32:00,479
Whether you're competing in the Loop
of Kon Garat or taking the kids to school,

423
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:02,842
use Ion Pro in your power source.

424
00:32:02,927 --> 00:32:05,680
Ion Pro from
Tech Con Propulsion Systems,

425
00:32:05,767 --> 00:32:09,123
your systemwide experts
in ion-drive technology.

426
00:32:09,207 --> 00:32:14,156
- I can't let you inside without clearance.
- We're looking for people in the building.

427
00:32:14,247 --> 00:32:16,556
If you give me their names, I'll check.

428
00:32:16,647 --> 00:32:19,241
- OK. One of them is named...
- Eamon.

429
00:32:19,327 --> 00:32:20,919
Eamon.

430
00:32:21,007 --> 00:32:24,443
- And his cousin Murray?
- Murray! Yes, that's them.

431
00:32:24,527 --> 00:32:27,041
- Yes, they're here.
- Can we come inside now?

432
00:32:27,127 --> 00:32:28,719
No.

433
00:32:30,287 --> 00:32:33,359
All right, here's what I'd like you to do.

434
00:32:33,447 --> 00:32:36,359
Pick up that phone,
call Mr Whoever-Runs-This-Place.

435
00:32:36,447 --> 00:32:38,802
- Hagan.
- I'm sorry, but I just can't...

436
00:32:38,887 --> 00:32:40,684
We're old friends.

437
00:32:40,767 --> 00:32:45,477
Tell him Mr Man-Who-Has-The-Stargate
is here to see him. He'll understand.

438
00:32:45,567 --> 00:32:47,558
Stargate.

439
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:50,598
Go ahead.

440
00:32:50,687 --> 00:32:52,678
Buttons. Phone.

441
00:32:54,447 --> 00:32:57,245
Mr Hagan, please.

442
00:32:57,327 --> 00:32:59,636
Nice.

443
00:33:01,687 --> 00:33:07,876
What are you going to do, Tynan?
He's an alien. His people will miss him.

444
00:33:08,647 --> 00:33:11,844
- Tynan, respond.
- What is it, Muirios?

445
00:33:11,927 --> 00:33:17,923
It's the "Seberus". Warrick is still in
the race and he's gaining on my position.

446
00:33:26,407 --> 00:33:28,284
Hard left!

447
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:35,362
What was that?

448
00:33:36,887 --> 00:33:40,721
- You said left!
- Oh, did I? Sorry.

449
00:33:40,807 --> 00:33:44,356
This is a waste of time.
We don't have a chance.

450
00:33:44,447 --> 00:33:46,756
- You're gonna get us killed.
- Shut up!

451
00:33:58,127 --> 00:34:02,518
How did this happen? You said the
"Seberus" would be disabled and I'd win.

452
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:06,202
You will win, Muirios.
Just focus on what you have to do.

453
00:34:06,287 --> 00:34:09,199
I'll take care of the Seberus.

454
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:13,759
Tynan calling the Seberus.

455
00:34:14,247 --> 00:34:17,205
- I know you can hear me.
- What do you want, Tynan?

456
00:34:17,287 --> 00:34:22,805
I only intended to disable your ship, but
your stubbornness has forced my hand.

457
00:34:22,887 --> 00:34:25,765
I have your brother
and one of the visitors from Earth,

458
00:34:25,847 --> 00:34:29,396
so drop out of the race. Now.

459
00:34:54,767 --> 00:34:56,917
Dr Jackson.

460
00:34:57,007 --> 00:34:58,679
Colonel O'Neill.

461
00:34:58,767 --> 00:35:02,555
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
What can I do for you?

462
00:35:02,647 --> 00:35:07,641
We think a member of our group might
somehow be lost inside your building

463
00:35:07,727 --> 00:35:09,763
with one of your employees.

464
00:35:09,847 --> 00:35:12,600
Lost? That seems unlikely.

465
00:35:13,567 --> 00:35:16,240
Well, you gotta know the guy.

466
00:35:17,567 --> 00:35:19,683
Of course. Come with me.

467
00:35:26,527 --> 00:35:29,564
We were gaining on them.
We had a chance.

468
00:35:29,647 --> 00:35:34,596
You'll let a little thing like your brother's
life stop you from winning the race?

469
00:35:34,687 --> 00:35:36,678
Shut up.

470
00:35:46,967 --> 00:35:49,527
Muirios, La'el Montrose is gaining on you.

471
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:54,123
- You were supposed to take care of her.
- She must have overcome the problem.

472
00:35:54,207 --> 00:35:56,084
- Lose her.
- I'm trying.

473
00:35:56,167 --> 00:35:59,603
Try harder. Do whatever you have to.

474
00:36:00,807 --> 00:36:03,446
Get rid of them. Take them away.

475
00:36:05,967 --> 00:36:07,958
Hello, Del.

476
00:36:08,847 --> 00:36:11,042
Mr Hagan.

477
00:36:16,527 --> 00:36:19,166
Nice outfit. You guys OK?

478
00:36:19,247 --> 00:36:20,441
Indeed.

479
00:36:20,527 --> 00:36:25,317
How many times have I told you,
don't get caught by the bad guys?

480
00:36:25,407 --> 00:36:26,965
How could you do this, Del?

481
00:36:27,047 --> 00:36:31,916
He says he was defending his people from
a Serrakin conspiracy to enslave humans.

482
00:36:32,007 --> 00:36:35,761
I did what I had to.
Your kind are a disease.

483
00:36:35,847 --> 00:36:37,838
The only disease here is greed.

484
00:36:37,927 --> 00:36:42,443
He was protecting the deal he made with
Muirios, which I suspect was lucrative.

485
00:36:42,527 --> 00:36:45,360
The reason you've been
passed over for advancement

486
00:36:45,447 --> 00:36:49,326
is because you've been under
investigation for corruption for a year.

487
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:52,285
We couldn't prove anything, until now.

488
00:36:52,367 --> 00:36:55,484
I intend to file a protest
with the Employment Council.

489
00:36:55,567 --> 00:37:00,163
Employment is the least
of your worries right now, Del.

490
00:37:01,927 --> 00:37:04,680
Warrick, Major Carter, it's Eamon.
Are you there?

491
00:37:04,767 --> 00:37:08,123
- Eamon, are you all right?
- Teal'c and I are safe.

492
00:37:08,207 --> 00:37:11,244
Now get back in the race and win.

493
00:37:11,327 --> 00:37:13,124
If you can.

494
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:26,082
- You must be out of your mind!
- Do not say a word.

495
00:37:26,167 --> 00:37:28,886
Major, give me all you've got.

496
00:37:28,967 --> 00:37:30,764
Max power.

497
00:37:33,447 --> 00:37:35,961
I hate to say it, but Jarlath might be right.

498
00:37:36,047 --> 00:37:40,120
Muirios has too big a lead.
We'll never catch him.

499
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:46,122
He cheated. I can't believe
they'll still let him take first prize.

500
00:37:46,207 --> 00:37:49,563
Unless we can keep Muirios
from crossing the finish line first.

501
00:37:49,647 --> 00:37:51,956
- How can we do that?
- That's easy.

502
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,638
Just get me close.

503
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:06,401
The closest we will get is when they
double back past us after the final turn.

504
00:38:06,487 --> 00:38:08,478
It'll have to do.

505
00:38:09,967 --> 00:38:14,358
- What are you doing?
- Rerouting the conduit from your device

506
00:38:14,447 --> 00:38:17,405
and doubling it back
through the communications array.

507
00:38:17,487 --> 00:38:21,082
- Why? So we can ask him to lose?
- Humorous.

508
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:23,203
More like tell him.

509
00:38:23,287 --> 00:38:27,280
This will allow us
to send a blast transmission.

510
00:38:28,767 --> 00:38:35,320
If my aim is correct, it'll temporarily freeze
the command controls on Muirios's ship.

511
00:38:35,407 --> 00:38:39,400
- You are even crazier than I thought.
- Never was much of a pilot.

512
00:38:39,487 --> 00:38:41,478
But weapons?

513
00:38:41,567 --> 00:38:43,558
It's an art.

514
00:38:45,447 --> 00:38:48,325
They're coming around the final turn.

515
00:38:57,927 --> 00:39:02,478
- He's trying to take out La'el's ship.
- I don't think so.

516
00:39:14,607 --> 00:39:16,199
Well done.

517
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,084
Ah, don't make me sick.

518
00:39:19,127 --> 00:39:21,516
Unbelievable/ What a finish/

519
00:39:21,607 --> 00:39:25,077
La'el Montrose has won
the Loop of Kon Garat/

520
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:28,876
- What happened to Muirios?
- It was his race to lose, and he lost it.

521
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:31,800
Some kind of beam weapon
caused his ship's power to fail.

522
00:39:31,887 --> 00:39:34,720
Opening the door
for La'el Montrose to take it all.

523
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:37,560
You have got to love
there are no rules in this race.

524
00:39:37,647 --> 00:39:40,036
It's what makes
this competition so special.

525
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,436
I must say,
I haven't seen anything like it.

526
00:39:42,527 --> 00:39:46,406
You must be particularly surprised,
since you picked Muirios to win.

527
00:39:46,487 --> 00:39:48,284
Yes, I was wrong about that.

528
00:39:48,367 --> 00:39:51,086
You also said Warrick
wouldn't be in contention,

529
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:53,840
and yet he came very close
to finishing this race.

530
00:39:53,927 --> 00:39:57,124
- I was wrong about that too.
- Predictions for next year?

531
00:39:57,207 --> 00:39:59,198
Well, I'd rather not say/

532
00:39:59,287 --> 00:40:05,965
Back with interviews after a word from
our sponsor, Corso's Temporal Eatery,

533
00:40:06,047 --> 00:40:09,801
where your whole family can eat
what they want, when they want.

534
00:40:09,887 --> 00:40:12,560
Part of the Tech Con Group
family of restaurants.

535
00:40:14,207 --> 00:40:17,438
- Sorry we did not win.
- It was still worth it.

536
00:40:39,367 --> 00:40:41,039
Hey.

537
00:40:41,127 --> 00:40:42,719
Hey.

538
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:48,157
Warrick just told me the winner of the race
hired him as copilot on her new contract.

539
00:40:48,247 --> 00:40:50,522
- That's great.
- Yeah, he sounded happy.

540
00:40:50,607 --> 00:40:53,167
- You don't.
- I'm fine.

541
00:40:53,247 --> 00:40:56,557
- You still got that ion drive to study.
- I know. Very cool.

542
00:40:56,647 --> 00:41:00,196
- You're just sore that you lost.
- Well, it wasn't fair.

543
00:41:00,287 --> 00:41:02,278
Bunch of cheaters.

544
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:05,916
So what you gonna do?

545
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:09,601
Next year, I'm gonna kick butt.
