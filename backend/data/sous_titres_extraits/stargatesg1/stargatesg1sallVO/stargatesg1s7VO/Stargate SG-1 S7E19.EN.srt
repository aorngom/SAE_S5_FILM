1
00:00:31,327 --> 00:00:34,205
Major Carter, Dr Jackson, Teal'c.
Glad you could make it.

2
00:00:34,287 --> 00:00:35,481
Agent Barrett.

3
00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:38,923
- How's Colonel O'Neill?
- Still recovering. Taking some time off.

4
00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:42,556
We're still putting the details together.
Follow me. I'll explain.

5
00:00:42,647 --> 00:00:45,639
- What is this place?
- An abandoned industrial complex.

6
00:00:45,727 --> 00:00:49,845
It was home to a rogue NID sleeper cell
we've been trying to locate for over a year.

7
00:00:49,927 --> 00:00:52,566
- Still haven't got them all?
- Not by a long shot.

8
00:00:52,647 --> 00:00:56,435
Their ties run deep.
They seem to have infinite resources.

9
00:00:56,527 --> 00:01:00,042
- What were they doing here?
- We're not exactly sure yet.

10
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:01,924
What happened?

11
00:01:02,007 --> 00:01:06,205
At approximately 0800 hours this morning,
we intercepted a 911 call.

12
00:01:06,287 --> 00:01:10,519
We moved in just after local authorities
arrived and have been in lockdown mode.

13
00:01:10,607 --> 00:01:15,806
Somebody from a top-secret, not to
mention illegal, NID operation called 911?

14
00:01:15,887 --> 00:01:18,321
It got real ugly. Come on.

15
00:01:19,647 --> 00:01:24,562
We got a call from a panicked male voice.
We think it was from the cleaning staff.

16
00:01:24,647 --> 00:01:26,638
The call was cut short.

17
00:01:28,767 --> 00:01:34,364
We've counted 32 casualties, which
includes a six-man security contingent.

18
00:01:34,447 --> 00:01:37,962
- Who would do this?
- And for what reason?

19
00:01:38,047 --> 00:01:40,117
We know who did it. As for why...

20
00:01:40,207 --> 00:01:42,960
- You know who did this?
- Yeah.

21
00:01:50,647 --> 00:01:52,638
Open it.

22
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:09,358
It was her.

23
00:03:21,127 --> 00:03:26,201
At first we thought she was a survivor,
and then we found this.

24
00:03:39,087 --> 00:03:43,444
We found her in a corner. She seemed
terrified, no memory of what happened.

25
00:03:43,527 --> 00:03:46,599
- You put her in the cell?
- She said that's where they kept her.

26
00:03:46,687 --> 00:03:49,724
We locked her up
after we found the security tapes.

27
00:03:49,807 --> 00:03:52,640
- Who is she?
- We're not sure yet. She's been printed.

28
00:03:52,727 --> 00:03:55,446
- I'm running her through the system.
- Other survivors?

29
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:59,759
A scientist, Keffler. We're holding him
upstairs. He hasn't been very talkative.

30
00:03:59,847 --> 00:04:04,318
Come on, let me show you
why I called you guys down here.

31
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:23,087
Wow.

32
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,522
Recognize anything?

33
00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:28,280
Nothing I've catalogued
as coming through the SGC.

34
00:04:31,007 --> 00:04:34,556
- This indicates it belonged to Sekhmet.
- Who was that?

35
00:04:34,647 --> 00:04:37,605
A Goa'uld
who at one time was loyal to Ra.

36
00:04:37,687 --> 00:04:39,757
She was a powerful ally of his.

37
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:42,600
He would dispatch her
to rule planets in his stead.

38
00:04:42,687 --> 00:04:45,759
Quell rebellions, oversee executions.
All the fun stuff.

39
00:04:45,847 --> 00:04:47,838
What happened to her?

40
00:04:47,927 --> 00:04:50,521
She was exiled for plotting against Ra.

41
00:04:50,607 --> 00:04:53,519
We also believe she lived here
for most of his dynasty.

42
00:04:53,607 --> 00:04:55,837
I didn't realize this had been recovered.

43
00:04:55,927 --> 00:04:59,602
- It may have come from the Germans.
- The Germans?

44
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:03,680
The background on Keffler says
that he's the son of a Nazi war criminal.

45
00:05:06,247 --> 00:05:10,160
- We shouldn't be that surprised.
- Rogue NID have no limits, do they?

46
00:05:10,647 --> 00:05:14,526
See if there's anything else
you can tell me about this stuff.

47
00:05:15,727 --> 00:05:18,446
I'm going to go back at Keffler again.
Want to join me?

48
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,119
Sure.

49
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:27,443
Thought you might want to watch
a master of interrogation at work.

50
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,644
You call in someone special?

51
00:05:32,887 --> 00:05:36,596
Dr Keffler.
This is Major Samantha Carter.

52
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:40,640
Of the Stargate programme.

53
00:05:40,727 --> 00:05:42,718
That's right.

54
00:05:44,487 --> 00:05:47,684
Are you ready to tell us about the girl?

55
00:05:49,687 --> 00:05:53,521
Doctor, do I really need to explain
the nature of your situation?

56
00:05:53,607 --> 00:05:56,167
Please do. It amuses me.

57
00:05:56,247 --> 00:05:59,080
This was an off-the-books NID operation,

58
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:03,843
which means you technically don't exist,
which means no phone calls, no lawyers.

59
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:06,043
I don't even
have to read you your rights.

60
00:06:06,127 --> 00:06:11,076
To make matters worse for you, the
people behind this operation are all in jail.

61
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:13,158
Nobody to bail you out.

62
00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:18,085
What kind of work was being done here,
Doctor?

63
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:22,001
You're a smart girl. You'll figure it out.

64
00:06:22,927 --> 00:06:25,395
Do you think
we'll let you walk away from this?

65
00:06:25,487 --> 00:06:29,366
- 32 people are dead.
- Believe it or not, I do feel bad about that.

66
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:34,043
Some of them were
not quite as incompetent as the others.

67
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:39,645
Unfortunately the bad ones
always ruin it for everyone, don't they?

68
00:06:45,007 --> 00:06:50,161
- What's this?
- That unlocks my car.

69
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,917
Don't think you're safe.

70
00:06:58,687 --> 00:07:03,556
Read the papers, Agent Barrett.
No-one is safe these days.

71
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:08,318
My pills.

72
00:07:18,207 --> 00:07:20,198
Now, now.

73
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:27,156
You wouldn't want your only witness
to die on you, would you?

74
00:07:34,407 --> 00:07:38,559
It's nitro. Says he has a bad heart. I'd say
an X-ray would confirm a total absence.

75
00:07:38,647 --> 00:07:42,435
- I think he's starting to crack.
- He was colder than Hannibal Lecter.

76
00:07:42,527 --> 00:07:45,758
Still, obviously no match
for a master interrogator.

77
00:07:45,847 --> 00:07:49,840
- You didn't get all Clarice Starling on him.
- I didn't want to step on your toes.

78
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,122
- One more thing to show you.
- There's more?

79
00:07:52,207 --> 00:07:54,721
Trust me, I'm saving the best for last.

80
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:11,921
- This isn't at all creepy.
- It gets better.

81
00:08:26,407 --> 00:08:29,046
They look like
partially developed foetuses.

82
00:08:29,127 --> 00:08:31,436
They don't look human to me.

83
00:08:31,527 --> 00:08:35,964
- Failed experiments of some kind?
- "What kind?" is the question.

84
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:39,244
Well, there's one way to find out.

85
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:42,243
No. Forget it.

86
00:08:42,327 --> 00:08:45,125
We've already tried that.
All the codes are encrypted.

87
00:08:45,207 --> 00:08:49,598
- I've requested a data retrieval team.
- Present and accounted for.

88
00:08:49,687 --> 00:08:51,678
Right. Of course.

89
00:08:54,327 --> 00:08:57,046
- So, how have you been?
- Busy. You?

90
00:08:57,127 --> 00:08:58,196
Busy.

91
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,996
You know, I never properly thanked you
for that memo on Woolsey.

92
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:04,396
Maybe we could
go out for dinner sometime.

93
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:12,562
- I'm seeing someone right now.
- Really? You?

94
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:16,997
- Hm.
- Well, you asked me out.

95
00:09:17,087 --> 00:09:19,442
Yeah. Right. Sorry.

96
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:25,885
I'm going to go check in
with Dr Jackson and Teal'c.

97
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:31,759
Most of the artefacts
are related in some way to Sekhmet.

98
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:35,965
I'm guessing they were found on Earth,
possibly in an Egyptian tomb or crypt.

99
00:09:36,047 --> 00:09:42,282
- Nothing of note?
- No, it's interesting stuff, but not really.

100
00:09:42,807 --> 00:09:45,879
- What's this?
- It would appear to be an ark.

101
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:50,199
Ordained in the gold motif of Ra,
the sun god. Possibly a gift to Sekhmet.

102
00:09:50,287 --> 00:09:52,676
- What's in it?
- We haven't been able to open it.

103
00:09:52,767 --> 00:09:55,122
But these turn.

104
00:09:57,567 --> 00:10:00,718
- Some sort of combination lock?
- So it would seem.

105
00:10:00,807 --> 00:10:04,322
- Any luck with the scientist?
- No, not exactly.

106
00:10:04,407 --> 00:10:08,525
The girl may be on tape killing everybody,
but I'm sure that guy is not innocent.

107
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:10,916
What about that girl?

108
00:10:11,007 --> 00:10:14,886
She hasn't said anything
since we locked her up.

109
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:17,527
I was kind of hoping
that you'd give it a try.

110
00:10:17,607 --> 00:10:19,359
Me?

111
00:10:19,447 --> 00:10:23,042
Heard you got a knack
for this type of thing.

112
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:52,803
Hi, I'm Daniel Jackson.

113
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,118
You're Anna, right?

114
00:11:02,447 --> 00:11:04,915
You know, when I first saw you,

115
00:11:06,807 --> 00:11:11,437
I didn't believe that you could do
the things they said you did.

116
00:11:11,527 --> 00:11:15,236
And even after I saw it for myself,
I still don't believe it.

117
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:23,800
Look, I know you don't know me
and you have no reason to trust me, but...

118
00:11:23,887 --> 00:11:25,479
I want to help you.

119
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:30,283
Before I do that,
I need to know a few things first.

120
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:32,437
I need to know who you are.

121
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:37,483
What's happened to you.
Why you're here in a cell like this.

122
00:11:40,487 --> 00:11:43,081
Do you even understand me?

123
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:47,922
- I didn't kill those people.
- There's some overwhelming evidence.

124
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:50,164
It wasn't me.

125
00:11:54,767 --> 00:11:57,998
Please, you have to believe me.
It wasn't me.

126
00:12:06,687 --> 00:12:09,724
Turn it off. Turn it off!

127
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:14,758
Sorry.

128
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:20,200
I couldn't do those things.

129
00:12:20,287 --> 00:12:23,518
- It looks like you did.
- It's not me.

130
00:12:23,607 --> 00:12:26,121
- Then who is it?
- I don't know.

131
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:33,359
OK, where were you
when this was happening?

132
00:12:33,447 --> 00:12:36,007
If the person on the tape isn't you,
where were you?

133
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:38,078
I don't remember.

134
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:51,647
Who is Dr Keffler?

135
00:12:55,847 --> 00:12:57,997
He is the one who made me.

136
00:13:00,927 --> 00:13:03,805
- She says Keffler made her.
- What does that mean?

137
00:13:03,887 --> 00:13:07,960
- Some sort of genetic research?
- No, she's over 20 years old.

138
00:13:08,047 --> 00:13:10,515
The Asgard can rapidly grow
a human clone, but...

139
00:13:10,607 --> 00:13:14,441
Area 51 has a sample of Goa'uld
nanite technology from the planet Argos.

140
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,917
It can rapidly grow a human
with the ability to learn very quickly,

141
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:20,521
and the rogue NID
would have had access to that.

142
00:13:20,607 --> 00:13:23,804
She says Keffler is responsible
for everything that happened.

143
00:13:24,327 --> 00:13:26,283
- How?
- I don't know.

144
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:29,916
- Do you think she's telling the truth?
- I don't know what to think.

145
00:13:30,007 --> 00:13:33,477
She believes she didn't do it.
Says the girl on the tape isn't her.

146
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,159
How can that be possible?

147
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,636
The NID have cloned
a Goa'uld symbiote before.

148
00:13:37,727 --> 00:13:40,560
- She could be a clone.
- There could be more than one of her.

149
00:13:40,647 --> 00:13:43,241
- How well did you search the facility?
- Top to bottom.

150
00:13:43,327 --> 00:13:47,002
I better put an APB out to local authorities.

151
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,485
Anna, how long have you lived here?

152
00:14:01,247 --> 00:14:03,522
Since I remember.

153
00:14:03,607 --> 00:14:06,963
Yeah? How long is that, exactly?

154
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:09,277
I don't know.

155
00:14:10,407 --> 00:14:12,796
Have you ever had a birthday?

156
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:16,444
You know, a birthday.

157
00:14:16,527 --> 00:14:21,920
A cake with candles on it, funny hats, pin
the tail on the donkey, that kind of thing.

158
00:14:22,007 --> 00:14:25,602
He gave me this paper
and some new charcoal.

159
00:14:25,687 --> 00:14:27,678
Who, Dr Keffler?

160
00:14:29,287 --> 00:14:34,236
He always gave me paper,
but once he said it was my birthday.

161
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,446
Just once?

162
00:14:38,887 --> 00:14:42,243
Have you ever seen anything
outside of this room?

163
00:14:42,327 --> 00:14:44,795
Just pictures.

164
00:14:44,887 --> 00:14:49,438
I've read a lot of books
which describe the world outside.

165
00:14:49,527 --> 00:14:54,043
The mountains, oceans. The sun.

166
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:58,120
But you've never
experienced them first-hand?

167
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:04,164
What about these?

168
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:12,402
Those are the things I see in my dreams.

169
00:15:14,607 --> 00:15:16,996
Flashes.

170
00:15:17,087 --> 00:15:20,796
- They just come to me.
- Do they mean anything to you?

171
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:22,843
Just that they scare me.

172
00:15:24,367 --> 00:15:27,723
If they scare you so much,
why do you hang them up everywhere?

173
00:15:27,807 --> 00:15:30,367
I don't want them there.

174
00:15:30,447 --> 00:15:33,519
He hurts me if I take them down.

175
00:15:35,687 --> 00:15:37,678
They are important to him.

176
00:15:44,087 --> 00:15:48,877
Do you have any more
with one of those on it? Maybe on an ark?

177
00:15:59,287 --> 00:16:01,562
I got it. It's one of Anna's sketches.

178
00:16:01,647 --> 00:16:03,877
I think it's a combination
to open the ark.

179
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:32,480
- Did we just do that?
- I do not believe so.

180
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:35,161
It was activated some time ago.

181
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,323
I got a picture out to local authorities.

182
00:16:41,407 --> 00:16:44,126
If there's a girl that looks like her,
we'll find her.

183
00:16:44,207 --> 00:16:46,926
- I'm in. I have complete access.
- Nice work.

184
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:52,361
The files seem to document recent work
going back over three years.

185
00:16:52,447 --> 00:16:54,039
Recent work?

186
00:16:54,127 --> 00:16:58,359
The artefacts go back to Napoleon.
The Nazis eventually recovered them.

187
00:16:58,447 --> 00:17:00,915
They ended up in Keffler's father's hands.

188
00:17:03,527 --> 00:17:06,246
They found a Canopic jar.

189
00:17:07,007 --> 00:17:10,682
It's a vessel
containing a preserved symbiote.

190
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:14,123
Keffler spliced human ovum
with DNA taken from a Goa'uld.

191
00:17:14,207 --> 00:17:17,802
- She is a human-Goa'uld hybrid.
- Goa'uld pass on knowledge genetically.

192
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:21,846
They tried to create a human who
could tell them all a Goa'uld would know.

193
00:17:21,927 --> 00:17:24,885
- They didn't want to wait.
- Nanite technology from Area 51.

194
00:17:24,967 --> 00:17:26,958
So they could make her grow up quickly.

195
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:30,756
It took them 45 failures
before they finally got it right.

196
00:17:30,847 --> 00:17:33,441
- You can call off that APB.
- There's only one of her.

197
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:34,721
According to this.

198
00:17:34,807 --> 00:17:38,004
The previous attempts
either didn't blend properly

199
00:17:38,087 --> 00:17:40,203
or they grew too fast and died.

200
00:17:40,887 --> 00:17:44,277
The technology had to be modified
so the human could slowly learn

201
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:49,157
to gain access to the genetic knowledge
buried in her DNA.

202
00:17:49,247 --> 00:17:52,045
My God. They tortured the poor girl.

203
00:17:52,927 --> 00:17:55,157
Sensory deprivation, electrocution.

204
00:17:55,247 --> 00:17:59,035
- Major Carter. Agent Barrett.
- She's not a clone.

205
00:17:59,127 --> 00:18:02,881
There's only one of her and she's got
Goa'uld DNA blended with her own.

206
00:18:02,967 --> 00:18:05,401
That could explain her behaviour.

207
00:18:05,487 --> 00:18:08,081
- The ark is a bomb.
- What?

208
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:11,682
- The ark is a Goa'uld explosive device.
- And it's been activated.

209
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:14,645
- How much time do we have?
- Approximately 16 hours.

210
00:18:23,807 --> 00:18:25,798
How interesting.

211
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:32,156
Wipe that smarmy smile off your face
and tell me what's going on here!

212
00:18:32,247 --> 00:18:34,920
- You're hurting me.
- Nothing could make up for what you did.

213
00:18:35,007 --> 00:18:37,680
- Agent Barrett.
- Listen to her, Agent Barrett.

214
00:18:37,767 --> 00:18:42,397
You are gonna tell me everything I want
to know or I'm gonna beat you senseless.

215
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:45,198
What do you want to know?

216
00:18:50,487 --> 00:18:53,524
For starters,
do you know how to deactivate the bomb?

217
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:56,237
I didn't know it was a bomb.

218
00:18:56,327 --> 00:18:59,046
So this girl breaks out of her cell,
kills 32 people,

219
00:18:59,127 --> 00:19:01,322
sets a bomb and then sticks around?

220
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:04,922
- How does that make sense?
- Your problem, Agent Barrett,

221
00:19:05,007 --> 00:19:08,636
one among many, I must point out,
is that you see her as a girl.

222
00:19:08,727 --> 00:19:11,241
If you're gonna give us
moral justification...

223
00:19:11,327 --> 00:19:15,718
Please, Major. I know you have helped to
orchestrate the death of Goa'ulds before.

224
00:19:15,807 --> 00:19:19,720
Assassinated them in cold blood without
regard for the life of the human host.

225
00:19:19,807 --> 00:19:22,116
- I didn't create the problem.
- Neither did I.

226
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:24,402
I am merely trying to help solve it.

227
00:19:25,367 --> 00:19:28,120
The Goa'uld
are a terrible threat to us all.

228
00:19:28,207 --> 00:19:32,598
Anna is a conduit to the knowledge
that could level the playing field.

229
00:19:32,687 --> 00:19:35,918
And I think we all agree
that if killing one person

230
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:39,966
could save millions,
billions of innocent lives,

231
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:42,561
you would have no choice.

232
00:19:42,647 --> 00:19:44,683
You would do it.

233
00:19:46,007 --> 00:19:49,795
- Answer my question.
- I'm sorry, I've forgotten what it was.

234
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,082
Why set the bomb and stick around?

235
00:19:53,127 --> 00:19:55,243
Anna did not set that bomb.

236
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:58,046
- Then who did?
- The Goa'uld.

237
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:00,566
Sekhmet.

238
00:20:00,647 --> 00:20:05,277
But wait a minute. She doesn't have
a snake inside of her, right?

239
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:08,325
It's something we didn't expect.

240
00:20:09,687 --> 00:20:14,124
A separate and distinct personality.

241
00:20:14,927 --> 00:20:20,240
Anna's mind has created a personality
that acts like the Goa'uld Sekhmet?

242
00:20:20,327 --> 00:20:26,402
Yes, but I don't know if she is incapable
of dealing with the darkness within her,

243
00:20:26,487 --> 00:20:31,845
or if that knowledge is so powerful that
it is capable of manifesting itself as such.

244
00:20:31,927 --> 00:20:36,205
I only know that it emerges
and speaks as a unique entity.

245
00:20:36,287 --> 00:20:40,405
We have witnessed it with a growing
frequency. Anna has no awareness.

246
00:20:40,487 --> 00:20:44,560
To her, it is as if she has blacked out.

247
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:48,603
The Goa'uld personality comes out,
goes on a rampage, sets the bomb...

248
00:20:48,687 --> 00:20:51,679
But can't stay in control of the body
long enough.

249
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:55,919
Her breakthroughs are sporadic
and seem somewhat uncontrolled.

250
00:20:56,007 --> 00:20:58,805
- Still, why set the bomb?
- Leverage.

251
00:20:58,887 --> 00:20:59,876
Against what?

252
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:03,118
Sekhmet has conscious control
of the body for short periods.

253
00:21:03,207 --> 00:21:05,163
She wants more.

254
00:21:05,247 --> 00:21:08,717
She was gonna blackmail you
with the bomb.

255
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:12,996
The psyche is so simple, isn't it?

256
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:16,443
So single-minded.

257
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:19,564
It's truly fascinating to behold.

258
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:25,406
She thinks
you can give her that full control.

259
00:21:25,487 --> 00:21:27,557
Can you?

260
00:21:28,727 --> 00:21:32,163
She is the experiment.
I am the observer.

261
00:21:32,247 --> 00:21:36,126
The Goa'uld personality didn't
go do something like this on a whim.

262
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:40,840
You led her to believe that you have
the power to give her control of her life,

263
00:21:40,927 --> 00:21:44,681
and I'll bet you did it so she would
tell you what you want to know.

264
00:21:44,767 --> 00:21:47,406
How to save us all, Major.

265
00:21:49,247 --> 00:21:52,557
I'm not the only one who wants to know.

266
00:21:56,047 --> 00:21:58,720
I don't remember anything.

267
00:21:58,807 --> 00:22:00,877
I know this must be hard for you.

268
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:04,365
How can you know
what this is like for me?

269
00:22:04,447 --> 00:22:07,883
Cos I knew a boy once
and he was like you.

270
00:22:09,247 --> 00:22:12,478
- There are more like me?
- Not exactly.

271
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:15,604
He was born of two Goa'uld hosts.

272
00:22:16,607 --> 00:22:19,485
They call a child like that a Harsesis.

273
00:22:19,567 --> 00:22:24,516
- What happened to him?
- He was saved by a very powerful being.

274
00:22:24,607 --> 00:22:27,804
He ascended
to a higher plane of existence

275
00:22:27,887 --> 00:22:30,685
and, when he did,
he gained great power himself.

276
00:22:31,407 --> 00:22:33,921
He used it to show me
that the knowledge and memories

277
00:22:34,007 --> 00:22:38,398
passed on to him by the Goa'uld
genetically came with a terrible burden,

278
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:43,080
and how it was wrong
to seek it for any reason.

279
00:22:44,847 --> 00:22:46,838
Can I be saved like him?

280
00:22:47,887 --> 00:22:49,479
Maybe.

281
00:22:50,767 --> 00:22:52,758
Honestly, I don't know.

282
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:57,875
Will you help us shut this bomb off?

283
00:22:58,727 --> 00:23:01,560
- I don't know how.
- You do.

284
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:05,925
You knew how to open the ark.
It was in your drawings.

285
00:23:07,087 --> 00:23:09,601
I don't remember turning it on.

286
00:23:10,687 --> 00:23:17,479
I know, but somewhere inside your mind
is the answer, and I can help you find it.

287
00:23:26,007 --> 00:23:30,762
According to these readings, there's a
ten-pound block of naqahdah in this thing.

288
00:23:30,847 --> 00:23:34,237
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It would be very bad if it went off.

289
00:23:34,327 --> 00:23:37,797
It's a bomb. Usually
it's not a good thing when they go off.

290
00:23:37,887 --> 00:23:39,286
Can we move this?

291
00:23:39,367 --> 00:23:42,962
From what I know of Goa'uld weaponry,
that would be unwise.

292
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,242
It may have a sensor.

293
00:23:45,327 --> 00:23:51,516
Yeah, I don't even want to go there.
Let's... Let's see if we can disarm it here.

294
00:23:51,607 --> 00:23:54,724
I'll get the local authorities
to evacuate the area.

295
00:23:54,807 --> 00:23:58,436
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- How many miles are we talking about?

296
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:03,445
I don't know. How big is Orange County?

297
00:24:05,167 --> 00:24:07,397
You're kidding, right?

298
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:10,320
Do I look like a practical joker to you?

299
00:24:15,807 --> 00:24:18,401
Images just come to me.

300
00:24:18,487 --> 00:24:21,524
I draw them.
I don't know what they mean.

301
00:24:21,607 --> 00:24:24,075
Just relax and think about it.

302
00:24:25,087 --> 00:24:28,477
When you look at this,
what comes to mind?

303
00:24:29,807 --> 00:24:33,880
The blackouts.
They're happening more and more.

304
00:24:35,447 --> 00:24:37,881
Do you trust me?

305
00:24:37,967 --> 00:24:40,197
Do you trust me?

306
00:24:40,287 --> 00:24:43,757
I want to help you.
I don't want to hurt you.

307
00:24:43,847 --> 00:24:45,917
After I help you?

308
00:24:47,567 --> 00:24:51,116
It's not like that.
We have to shut this bomb off.

309
00:24:54,487 --> 00:24:59,083
- How many birthdays have you had?
- That's not important right now.

310
00:25:01,727 --> 00:25:04,116
You sound just like him.

311
00:25:10,047 --> 00:25:13,596
I heard you were in here.
What are you doing?

312
00:25:13,687 --> 00:25:16,281
I noticed most of the tapes
were labeled "Anna".

313
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:20,280
It's not just security footage.
It's documentation of the research.

314
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:22,881
- Anything useful?
- No.

315
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:26,960
Just something she said when we were
talking, that I reminded her of Keffler.

316
00:25:27,047 --> 00:25:30,323
Figured I needed to learn
about how he dealt with her.

317
00:25:30,407 --> 00:25:34,878
What are the chances you'll find out how
to deactivate the bomb from her in time?

318
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:36,559
I don't know.

319
00:25:36,647 --> 00:25:40,845
We're trying to evacuate the area.
We don't know how big the blast will be.

320
00:25:43,247 --> 00:25:45,715
No pressure. I'll leave now.

321
00:25:52,687 --> 00:25:56,123
I'd feel better if you were down there
working on the bomb.

322
00:25:56,207 --> 00:26:00,758
Dr Lee is the best we've got and Teal'c
knows more about Goa'uld weapons.

323
00:26:00,847 --> 00:26:04,840
I wanted to see if there was anything more
in the research notes that might help.

324
00:26:04,927 --> 00:26:06,121
Like what?

325
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:11,327
If we can offer Anna a cure for her
condition, she might be willing to help us.

326
00:26:11,407 --> 00:26:13,443
She's been horribly mistreated

327
00:26:13,527 --> 00:26:16,644
and without intervention
she'd have little hope of survival.

328
00:26:16,727 --> 00:26:20,561
At the time they made her, they had
no idea what her life span was gonna be.

329
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:25,596
Based on her current rate of growth, I
estimate it can't be more than three years.

330
00:26:25,687 --> 00:26:28,724
- Can you help her?
- Possibly.

331
00:26:28,807 --> 00:26:32,038
We should be able to halt
the rapid-growth effects of the nanites.

332
00:26:32,127 --> 00:26:35,756
I doubt we can unmarry
the Goa'uld DNA from hers,

333
00:26:35,847 --> 00:26:39,044
but we may be able to block
the knowledge from her conscious mind.

334
00:26:39,127 --> 00:26:41,197
Stop it from possessing her.

335
00:26:41,287 --> 00:26:44,359
We've had some luck with certain drugs
in similar situations.

336
00:26:44,447 --> 00:26:50,636
I suppose the fact that you've had similar
situations shouldn't come as a shock.

337
00:26:50,727 --> 00:26:53,878
- Anything on your end?
- Keffler. He wants to chat.

338
00:27:16,487 --> 00:27:18,478
There is a cure, Anna.

339
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:21,843
You can be a normal girl,
live a normal life.

340
00:27:21,927 --> 00:27:25,317
You can be free,
or you can continue to suffer.

341
00:27:26,487 --> 00:27:30,639
I don't know anything. Please stop.

342
00:27:33,607 --> 00:27:37,361
- Stop this at once.
- Now we're getting somewhere.

343
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:41,360
- Let me out of here.
- In due time, freedom can be yours.

344
00:27:41,967 --> 00:27:45,118
Do you think I will just tell you
the secrets of the Goa'uld?

345
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:48,802
- If you want to live.
- You will not kill me.

346
00:27:48,887 --> 00:27:51,447
I can make another
as easily as I made you.

347
00:27:51,527 --> 00:27:54,803
If it were up to me, given the chance

348
00:27:54,887 --> 00:27:59,165
I would rip the beating heart
from your chest and feed it to you.

349
00:28:00,087 --> 00:28:02,282
Such colourful language.

350
00:28:02,367 --> 00:28:05,040
Let's focus on the issue at hand,
shall we?

351
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:09,758
Son of a bitch.

352
00:28:09,847 --> 00:28:12,407
We have the same goal.

353
00:28:12,487 --> 00:28:15,285
I do not wish to see my work go to waste.

354
00:28:17,687 --> 00:28:20,645
Look... I know her.

355
00:28:20,727 --> 00:28:24,481
I know how her mind works.
I can get you what you need.

356
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:27,559
Yeah, I've read about your methods.

357
00:28:29,447 --> 00:28:31,438
I will only talk to her.

358
00:28:31,527 --> 00:28:33,995
You are welcome to be present
the entire time.

359
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:38,126
What do you want? I can't believe you'd
be doing this solely for the greater good.

360
00:28:38,607 --> 00:28:40,325
My freedom.

361
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,680
Not a chance.

362
00:28:43,767 --> 00:28:47,806
I am guilty of nothing more
than trying to save this world.

363
00:28:47,887 --> 00:28:51,038
Just like you. We are at war.

364
00:28:51,127 --> 00:28:53,516
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

365
00:28:54,647 --> 00:28:56,683
I've heard that defence.

366
00:28:57,447 --> 00:28:59,438
What choice do you have?

367
00:29:00,007 --> 00:29:02,965
How many people will die
if that bomb goes off?

368
00:29:03,607 --> 00:29:07,156
Let's consider this. Do you have
the authority to offer him immunity?

369
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:12,196
Trust me, no matter what we decide to do,
no court is ever gonna hear about this.

370
00:29:12,287 --> 00:29:13,845
Daniel?

371
00:29:17,887 --> 00:29:21,402
- You let her out, didn't you?
- You must be Daniel Jackson.

372
00:29:21,487 --> 00:29:22,886
What's going on?

373
00:29:22,967 --> 00:29:26,198
He can control when the Goa'uld
comes out. It's not just random.

374
00:29:26,287 --> 00:29:31,407
- He's got himself a little remote control.
- This?

375
00:29:31,487 --> 00:29:34,399
Yeah. He uses it to shock her.

376
00:29:34,487 --> 00:29:37,957
He can make the Goa'uld personality
appear, or kill her with it.

377
00:29:38,047 --> 00:29:42,199
Why? Other scientists gonna shut down
your research, report your experiment?

378
00:29:42,287 --> 00:29:43,686
You have no proof.

379
00:29:43,767 --> 00:29:47,806
You brought out the Goa'uld personality,
then let her out. You murdered 32 people.

380
00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:50,037
Speculation.

381
00:29:50,127 --> 00:29:52,436
You can control her with that.

382
00:29:52,527 --> 00:29:55,917
If you didn't want the scientists dead,
why didn't you stop her?

383
00:30:13,047 --> 00:30:15,038
Careful.

384
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:18,607
OK.

385
00:30:18,687 --> 00:30:20,996
Just because
the cover wasn't booby-trapped

386
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:24,204
doesn't mean the crystals themselves
are safe to touch.

387
00:30:24,287 --> 00:30:26,278
That is correct.

388
00:30:27,287 --> 00:30:29,960
There's no energy signatures.

389
00:30:30,047 --> 00:30:34,438
I don't think there's any force fields
or sensors protecting the compartment.

390
00:30:34,527 --> 00:30:38,236
I am unsure which of these crystals
would control detonation.

391
00:30:38,327 --> 00:30:42,400
- Blue is typically for power regulation.
- Indeed.

392
00:30:42,487 --> 00:30:45,559
If we remove the power regulation
for the control board...

393
00:30:45,647 --> 00:30:47,558
The device could explode.

394
00:30:51,487 --> 00:30:55,116
Yeah. I suppose. It's not like
I was gonna pull the yellow one.

395
00:30:57,127 --> 00:31:00,403
Obviously letting Keffler
anywhere near the girl is out.

396
00:31:00,487 --> 00:31:04,321
And if we're gonna get
the bomb deactivation code from Anna,

397
00:31:04,407 --> 00:31:06,398
you're gonna have to do it.

398
00:31:08,007 --> 00:31:09,998
Right.

399
00:31:16,287 --> 00:31:19,802
This red crystal
seems to control the timer.

400
00:31:19,887 --> 00:31:26,679
Now, I should be able to interface with it
and hopefully reprogram it.

401
00:31:31,327 --> 00:31:34,125
Anything happening?

402
00:31:34,207 --> 00:31:37,722
- The countdown is increasing in speed.
- What?

403
00:31:37,807 --> 00:31:39,798
Did that stop it?

404
00:31:42,087 --> 00:31:45,397
- Yes. However...
- Hey, how's it coming?

405
00:31:46,127 --> 00:31:48,277
Not well, I take it?

406
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:51,803
- No, we just had a little setback.
- What?

407
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:55,199
I was trying to interface
with a control crystal...

408
00:31:55,287 --> 00:31:59,883
The time until detonation
is now less than two hours.

409
00:31:59,967 --> 00:32:04,677
OK. Let's hope that Dr Jackson
is having better luck.

410
00:32:09,967 --> 00:32:11,958
They're trying to evacuate people,

411
00:32:12,047 --> 00:32:17,041
but if that bomb goes off,
people are still gonna die.

412
00:32:17,127 --> 00:32:18,924
Including us?

413
00:32:19,007 --> 00:32:23,762
We have a helicopter standing by to get us
to a safe distance if it comes to that.

414
00:32:23,847 --> 00:32:28,682
I'm hoping it doesn't, because
a lot of others won't have that luxury.

415
00:32:28,767 --> 00:32:32,043
I've been trying. I can't see anything.

416
00:32:36,407 --> 00:32:40,798
You know, not so long ago,
I had my memories erased.

417
00:32:40,887 --> 00:32:42,525
How?

418
00:32:42,607 --> 00:32:48,239
It's a long story, but I was able to access
certain lost memories by meditating.

419
00:32:48,327 --> 00:32:52,206
A friend of mine showed me how to do it.
I think that can help you.

420
00:32:52,287 --> 00:32:56,121
What I see scares me so much.

421
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:59,836
I know. And for good reason.

422
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:05,126
Ultimately it's up to you.
I can't force you to do this and I won't.

423
00:33:05,207 --> 00:33:09,041
And I promise, either way
we're gonna try and help you,

424
00:33:09,127 --> 00:33:11,118
make it so you can live a normal life.

425
00:33:14,487 --> 00:33:17,797
He always said he could do that.

426
00:33:19,407 --> 00:33:22,763
The truth is, I'm not sure if we can,

427
00:33:22,847 --> 00:33:26,237
but we're going to try
anything and everything in our power.

428
00:33:26,327 --> 00:33:31,276
OK, good. 42 minutes 15 seconds
and counting. I'll check back. Thanks.

429
00:33:31,367 --> 00:33:33,961
We've got ten blocks in each direction
evacuated.

430
00:33:34,047 --> 00:33:36,083
- That's nowhere near enough.
- I know.

431
00:33:36,687 --> 00:33:39,326
I finished going through the files
on the computer.

432
00:33:39,407 --> 00:33:41,762
Even if we halt
the nanites' rapid-growth effect,

433
00:33:41,847 --> 00:33:45,078
you didn't isolate the gene
with the Goa'uld genetic knowledge.

434
00:33:45,167 --> 00:33:48,159
We didn't have time
to sequence the entire strand.

435
00:33:48,247 --> 00:33:52,957
The goal was to get the intelligence,
not to create a viable living organism.

436
00:33:53,047 --> 00:33:56,642
- I don't understand.
- The way he blended the DNA.

437
00:33:56,727 --> 00:34:00,083
There's nothing we can do
to stop the Goa'uld DNA taking over.

438
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:03,876
It will overwrite the human
and nothing I know of will stop it.

439
00:34:03,967 --> 00:34:07,880
- What's going to happen to her?
- She'll die. A horrible, painful death.

440
00:34:07,967 --> 00:34:11,004
There's no cure, no way to save her.
That was just another lie.

441
00:34:11,087 --> 00:34:15,365
I placed a capsule of biotoxin
at the base of her brain.

442
00:34:15,447 --> 00:34:17,597
The remote device will activate it.

443
00:34:17,687 --> 00:34:22,715
I did this to prevent any undue suffering
when the time came.

444
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,678
How humane of you.

445
00:34:29,807 --> 00:34:35,325
- What do I do?
- Just relax and try thinking of nothing.

446
00:34:36,487 --> 00:34:38,762
Nothing?

447
00:34:38,847 --> 00:34:40,997
Try an empty room.

448
00:34:45,487 --> 00:34:47,523
You see a doorway.

449
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:50,682
Go to that door and open it.

450
00:34:52,527 --> 00:34:54,518
Go through.

451
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:57,836
You're inside of a stone room.

452
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:02,601
The floor is made of polished marble.

453
00:35:02,687 --> 00:35:04,996
You're inside of a great pyramid.

454
00:35:05,087 --> 00:35:09,399
Ornate carvings of giant snakes
flank a beautiful golden throne.

455
00:35:09,487 --> 00:35:13,116
You see a window
and you walk towards it.

456
00:35:13,207 --> 00:35:15,801
Outside there are thousands of people.

457
00:35:15,887 --> 00:35:18,481
Slaves who worship you as a god.

458
00:35:19,487 --> 00:35:21,523
You have great power over them.

459
00:35:21,607 --> 00:35:24,246
The power to decide
who lives and who dies.

460
00:35:25,247 --> 00:35:26,760
No!

461
00:35:29,967 --> 00:35:32,879
- I will tell you nothing.
- Anna!

462
00:35:44,607 --> 00:35:46,598
Anna, stop!

463
00:35:59,807 --> 00:36:01,399
No!

464
00:36:04,727 --> 00:36:06,240
Fire!

465
00:36:06,327 --> 00:36:08,887
Fire! Hurry! Come on!

466
00:36:11,807 --> 00:36:14,196
Hurry!

467
00:36:30,887 --> 00:36:32,878
Daniel. You OK?

468
00:36:32,967 --> 00:36:36,403
- Where is she?
- She won't get far.

469
00:36:36,487 --> 00:36:41,800
This is Agent Barrett. The female prisoner
is unaccounted for. Secure all exits.

470
00:36:41,887 --> 00:36:44,799
Secure entire perimeter
and begin a full sweep.

471
00:36:44,887 --> 00:36:48,596
Target is armed and dangerous.
Use extreme caution.

472
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:08,285
Ugh!

473
00:37:25,527 --> 00:37:29,236
I don't think she's acting as the Goa'uld.

474
00:37:29,327 --> 00:37:31,318
Daniel!

475
00:37:43,567 --> 00:37:47,640
I just, uh... need a drink of water.

476
00:37:48,647 --> 00:37:51,366
Please, I'm...

477
00:37:51,447 --> 00:37:54,917
I'm not feeling one hundred per cent.

478
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,644
Agh... My pills.

479
00:38:01,807 --> 00:38:03,798
Ugh!

480
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:11,479
I think it's the deactivation code.

481
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:22,842
Agent Barrett, this is Major Carter.
Come in. What's your location?

482
00:38:22,927 --> 00:38:24,918
Agent Barrett?

483
00:38:40,607 --> 00:38:43,440
This is Carter.
Agent Barrett needs medical attention.

484
00:38:43,527 --> 00:38:46,599
We are in the northeast corridor,
level one.

485
00:38:51,927 --> 00:38:54,487
That's it. It's off.

486
00:38:54,567 --> 00:38:57,877
I mean, the lights turned off.
That means it's off, right?

487
00:38:57,967 --> 00:38:59,958
Indeed.

488
00:39:01,567 --> 00:39:04,559
Well, hey...

489
00:39:27,687 --> 00:39:29,803
Drop the gun.

490
00:39:30,967 --> 00:39:32,764
- Anna...
- Drop it!

491
00:39:41,967 --> 00:39:47,041
Come with me... now... to the lab.

492
00:39:48,247 --> 00:39:52,206
- I will help you.
- You can't help me.

493
00:39:53,327 --> 00:39:57,366
- Whatever they've told you...
- It doesn't matter.

494
00:39:57,447 --> 00:40:00,007
I never believed you.

495
00:40:00,087 --> 00:40:04,478

All the evil I have seen in my mind,

00:40:09,047 --> 00:40:14,405
nothing you put inside me
