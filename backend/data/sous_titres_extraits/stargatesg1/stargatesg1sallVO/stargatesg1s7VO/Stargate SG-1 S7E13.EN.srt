1
00:00:05,687 --> 00:00:08,884
Previously on "Stargate SG-1":

2
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:13,483
This is Prometheus,
otherwise known as the X-303.

3
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:17,323
Sir, there's an energy build-up
in the naquadria cells.

4
00:00:17,407 --> 00:00:20,763
The jump must've triggered a surge
that overloaded the control systems.

5
00:00:20,847 --> 00:00:24,283
Stand by to jettison the reactor module.

6
00:00:25,647 --> 00:00:29,401
Even if we plotted a course for Earth
using maximum sublight thrust,

7
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:30,636
it'd take years.

8
00:00:30,727 --> 00:00:32,240
P3X-744.

9
00:00:32,327 --> 00:00:35,763
If we can gate home from there, we can
get what we need to repair the ship.

10
00:00:43,647 --> 00:00:46,445
So this thing is different
from a nebula. How?

11
00:00:46,527 --> 00:00:49,644
That's why it's so exciting, sir.
We don't know exactly.

12
00:00:49,727 --> 00:00:54,118
And this formation just happens to be
near our next cool-down coordinates?

13
00:00:54,207 --> 00:00:58,280
It'll only be a little bit out of our way,
Colonel. All I ask is two hours, tops.

14
00:00:58,367 --> 00:01:01,200
If only to see the expression
on your face first-hand.

15
00:01:01,287 --> 00:01:04,962
- "Kid" and "candy store" come to mind.
- I'll try to retain my composure.

16
00:01:05,047 --> 00:01:08,960
Just keep in mind that our mission
is to get this bird home in one piece.

17
00:01:09,047 --> 00:01:11,242
Colonel Ronson, report to the bridge.

18
00:01:11,327 --> 00:01:14,046
Must be time. After you, Major.

19
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:23,682
Sir, the hyperdrive engines
are at maximum safe temperature.

20
00:01:23,767 --> 00:01:27,726
- Shut 'em down, Major Gant.
- Yes, sir. Dropping out of hyperspace.

21
00:01:31,647 --> 00:01:34,002
Major Carter, what's our progress?

22
00:01:34,087 --> 00:01:37,477
Well, sir, we covered 49 light years
in the last leg.

23
00:01:37,567 --> 00:01:41,401
Considering the hyperdrive was lifted
from an Alkesh, that's pretty good.

24
00:01:41,487 --> 00:01:44,797
It was originally designed
for a ship one-tenth this size.

25
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:47,845
Only five more of these pit stops
and we're home.

26
00:01:49,807 --> 00:01:53,800
Colonel, a bogey just appeared on
our sensors. Dead ahead, 3,000 clicks.

27
00:01:53,887 --> 00:01:56,037
- Can't you identify it?
- Negative, sir.

28
00:01:56,127 --> 00:01:58,561
It's closing in on us very quickly.

29
00:02:00,007 --> 00:02:02,237
Sound general quarters.

30
00:02:05,807 --> 00:02:10,198
- Bogey's now at 2,000 clicks.
- Raise shields. Arm weapons.

31
00:03:33,767 --> 00:03:37,521
Bogey is now at 900 clicks.
It's not slowing down, sir.

32
00:03:37,607 --> 00:03:40,121
How long till we can
jump to hyperspace again?

33
00:03:40,207 --> 00:03:44,086
The hyperdrive needs two hours to cool
down before attempting another jump.

34
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:46,635
If we try one before that, it could overload.

35
00:03:52,007 --> 00:03:55,841
Colonel, I'm getting some unusual
readings from the alien vessel.

36
00:03:59,327 --> 00:04:01,238
They're scanning us, sir.

37
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:06,447
Major Gant, set up a wide-frequency
broadcast. I wanna talk to them.

38
00:04:07,887 --> 00:04:09,684
Go ahead, sir.

39
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:13,123
This is Colonel William Ronson,
commander of the Prometheus.

40
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:15,482
Please respond.

41
00:04:17,887 --> 00:04:22,563
If you can hear me,
I offer you peaceful greetings.

42
00:04:22,647 --> 00:04:26,481
Bogey is now at 400 clicks and
continuing to gain on our position, sir.

43
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:30,560
Sir, thermographic sensors are showing
a build-up of energy within the ship.

44
00:04:36,407 --> 00:04:40,400
- Energy build-up is continuing, sir.
- Colonel, we have to get out of here.

45
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:43,718
Major Gant, initiate
evasive manoeuvre Delta now.

46
00:04:43,807 --> 00:04:45,525
Yes, sir. Executing Delta.

47
00:04:59,047 --> 00:05:02,198
- Major Gant, report.
- Shields are down 69%.

48
00:05:02,287 --> 00:05:04,847
Their weapons are draining our shields.

49
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:10,966
- 53%.
- Reroute auxiliary power to shields.

50
00:05:11,047 --> 00:05:13,845
Weapons Officer, prepare
to return fire on my command.

51
00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:16,395
Aft missile bays
one through six ready, sir.

52
00:05:16,487 --> 00:05:18,682
Fire one through four now.

53
00:05:25,647 --> 00:05:29,083
Sir, missiles destroyed
before reaching the target.

54
00:05:30,807 --> 00:05:35,676
Alien vessel is still gaining on us, sir.
Shield strength is at 32%.

55
00:05:36,487 --> 00:05:38,842
Fire all missiles at will.

56
00:05:38,927 --> 00:05:42,761
Wait. Suggest diverting auxiliary power
back to the sublight engines.

57
00:05:42,847 --> 00:05:43,643
Major?

58
00:05:43,727 --> 00:05:48,517
The gas cloud. If we can get inside it, it
might make it harder for them to track us.

59
00:05:50,927 --> 00:05:53,043
Shields are below 15%.

60
00:05:53,127 --> 00:05:56,039
Even with engines at full strength,
we'll never make it.

61
00:05:56,127 --> 00:05:59,358
We might be able to make a small
hyperspace jump into the cloud.

62
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:01,961
Give me a few minutes
to override the safeguards.

63
00:06:02,047 --> 00:06:04,083
You have two.

64
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,196
Come on. One jump.

65
00:06:29,007 --> 00:06:32,920
- Weapon systems no longer operational.
- Shields are below 10%.

66
00:06:33,007 --> 00:06:37,046
Receiving ship-wide
damage reports, Colonel.

67
00:07:22,127 --> 00:07:25,119
This is Major Carter calling the bridge.

68
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:30,642
Bridge, please respond.

69
00:08:14,407 --> 00:08:17,558
This is the bridge calling all decks.

70
00:08:17,647 --> 00:08:20,639
Please respond.

71
00:08:46,367 --> 00:08:50,804
This is Major Samantha Carter of
the US Air Force vessel Prometheus.

72
00:08:50,887 --> 00:08:56,007
As the sole remaining crew member, I feel
compelled to keep a log of these events.

73
00:08:56,087 --> 00:08:58,396
After being attacked
by a hostile alien ship,

74
00:08:58,487 --> 00:09:01,126
I sustained an injury
and lost consciousness.

75
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:05,405
When I awoke,
I found the ship devoid of all crew.

76
00:09:05,487 --> 00:09:09,275
An initial systems review indicated
the hyperdrive to be operational.

77
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:14,566
But the sublight engines remain offline,
possibly due to damage from the attack.

78
00:09:14,647 --> 00:09:19,926
I am hopeful further investigation
will provide more answers.

79
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,441
However, my first priority
is to find out what happened to the crew.

80
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,995
Having searched the ship
and found no one,

81
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:33,763
only one possibility remains
to explain their disappearance.

82
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:56,200
Since all the ship's escape pods
have been jettisoned,

83
00:09:56,287 --> 00:10:00,246
I must assume an evacuation order
was given after my losing consciousness.

84
00:10:00,327 --> 00:10:04,115
In the chaos that must have ensued,
I was left behind.

85
00:10:14,087 --> 00:10:16,078
The sublight engines remain offline.

86
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:20,001
I guess something about the gas cloud
is prohibiting restart procedures.

87
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:23,443
Thus far, I have been unable
to find a way around this problem.

88
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:27,565
Without sublight engine power
to manoeuvre the ship,

89
00:10:27,647 --> 00:10:30,639
I'm left with only one other option.

90
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,118
Damn it.

91
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:05,720
Major Carter.

92
00:11:05,807 --> 00:11:08,367
- Teal'c?
- Hear me.

93
00:11:08,447 --> 00:11:11,837
You must remain conscious at all costs.

94
00:11:13,127 --> 00:11:16,597
- I just need to rest for a while.
- You cannot.

95
00:11:18,247 --> 00:11:19,600
Listen to me.

96
00:11:19,687 --> 00:11:23,680
You are injured.
If you sleep, you will die.

97
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,758
Do you understand?

98
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:29,317
I know...

99
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:33,923
If you sleep, you will die.

100
00:12:05,047 --> 00:12:10,758
# Twinkle, twinkle, little star

101
00:12:11,407 --> 00:12:17,084
# How I wonder what you are

102
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:22,725
# Up above the world so high

103
00:12:24,047 --> 00:12:29,758
- Is someone there?
- # Like a diamond in the sky

104
00:12:30,687 --> 00:12:35,283
# Twinkle, twinkle, little star

105
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:36,163
Hello?

106
00:12:36,247 --> 00:12:41,844
# How I wonder what you are

107
00:12:50,847 --> 00:12:52,405
OK...

108
00:12:57,047 --> 00:13:00,562
I have sent out a distress signal
detailing Prometheus's situation

109
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,877
and our last known position in space.

110
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:05,606
I know it may be hundreds of years
before it is heard.

111
00:13:07,607 --> 00:13:10,280
That said, Stargate Command
was aware of our route

112
00:13:10,367 --> 00:13:14,519
and will undoubtedly do
everything they can to mount a rescue.

113
00:13:14,607 --> 00:13:16,802
And if any of the crew survived,

114
00:13:16,887 --> 00:13:20,038
I can only hope they will
eventually send help as well.

115
00:13:20,127 --> 00:13:25,520
Therefore I feel my best course of action
is to settle in for the long haul.

116
00:13:30,407 --> 00:13:34,366
By my calculations, I have enough
food and water to last several months.

117
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:38,918
With further rationing,
it might be possible to double that.

118
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:47,520
Play with me.

119
00:14:04,487 --> 00:14:08,639
I've been trying to understand why
the ship is unable to jump hyperspace.

120
00:14:08,727 --> 00:14:10,319
During my last attempt,

121
00:14:10,407 --> 00:14:14,116
the hyperspace window seemed
too unstable for the ship to enter it.

122
00:14:14,207 --> 00:14:18,837
Thus far, sensors have been unable
to identify the content of the cloud itself.

123
00:14:18,927 --> 00:14:24,126
It's more likely made up of a denser group
of gases than that of a typical nebula.

124
00:14:24,207 --> 00:14:28,997
It's preventing the hyperdrive emitter
from transferring power at an even rate.

125
00:14:29,087 --> 00:14:33,205
Until that changes, the Prometheus
will remain trapped here indefinitely.

126
00:14:33,287 --> 00:14:37,075
Yep! I'd say you're stuck all right.

127
00:14:43,287 --> 00:14:46,597
You've been running the same
diagnostic program for four hours.

128
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:50,362
What makes you think the results
are suddenly gonna change?

129
00:14:51,447 --> 00:14:53,836
Sam! Hello?

130
00:14:54,607 --> 00:14:56,882
Were you this annoying
when you were ascended?

131
00:14:56,967 --> 00:15:02,360
Depends who you ask. I thought I had a
certain je ne sais quoi. Timing was so-so.

132
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:07,277
No offence, but I really
don't have time for this.

133
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:14,244
This is ridiculous. You aren't even real.

134
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:18,525
Well, I'm not so much me
as I am... you, really.

135
00:15:18,607 --> 00:15:21,121
I mean, part of your subconscious mind.

136
00:15:21,207 --> 00:15:23,402
So am I real?

137
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:28,436
That's up to you, I guess. The Socratic
implications are quite fascinating.

138
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:32,202
- Daniel...
- You just need some help, that's all.

139
00:15:32,287 --> 00:15:34,881
Can't you just try to go along with this?

140
00:15:37,527 --> 00:15:40,087
You're me, talking to me.

141
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:43,083
Yeah, basically.

142
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:48,039
All right. You have a point.
I could use some help.

143
00:15:48,127 --> 00:15:50,118
Thank you.

144
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:56,921
OK, what do you... I want?

145
00:15:57,007 --> 00:15:58,679
Well...

146
00:15:58,767 --> 00:16:01,839
- I think you're going about this all wrong.
- This is helping?

147
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,395
You've waited weeks
to study this gas cloud.

148
00:16:04,487 --> 00:16:07,445
Isn't that the real reason
you volunteered for this job?

149
00:16:07,527 --> 00:16:09,518
Now you're here, finally here,

150
00:16:09,607 --> 00:16:12,883
and you're wasting your time
running hyperdrive simulations.

151
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:18,087
In case you hadn't noticed, I've got
a small problem, Daniel. I'm stranded.

152
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:21,364
Inside the thing you've looked at
through a telescope for years.

153
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:25,998
It's a chance to study something rare
and exciting up close. Seize the moment!

154
00:16:26,087 --> 00:16:27,486
Seize the moment?

155
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:31,242
It's something new
that we've never encountered before...

156
00:16:31,327 --> 00:16:34,046
You're ignoring it.

157
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:36,197
Does that sound like you?

158
00:16:38,287 --> 00:16:42,758
Daniel, I can't even think straight,
let alone stay awake.

159
00:16:44,247 --> 00:16:47,603
Sam... you have to check this out.

160
00:16:47,687 --> 00:16:50,440
Trust me. It's important.

161
00:17:39,527 --> 00:17:41,518
Oh, my God...

162
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:01,644
Oh!

163
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:11,196
- You hear about Sam?
- Yeah.

164
00:18:11,287 --> 00:18:13,278
Doesn't sound good.

165
00:18:14,807 --> 00:18:20,643
18 hours past due for contact.
Yeah, I'd say something went wrong.

166
00:18:23,047 --> 00:18:26,437
I made a list of planets with Stargates
in range of the Prometheus route.

167
00:18:26,527 --> 00:18:30,600
General Hammond has agreed to send
SG teams to all of them, including us.

168
00:18:30,687 --> 00:18:32,643
Why?

169
00:18:32,727 --> 00:18:36,800
If something went wrong, they might
be able to make it to a planet with a gate.

170
00:18:36,887 --> 00:18:40,436
At which time, they would gate home,
wouldn't they?

171
00:18:40,527 --> 00:18:43,041
When the hyperdrive failed
on the maiden voyage,

172
00:18:43,127 --> 00:18:47,643
you were nearly stranded on P7X-009.
They didn't know where the gate was.

173
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:49,957
Sounds like a long shot.

174
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:52,845
Unfortunately the Tok'ra
are unable to send a ship now.

175
00:18:52,927 --> 00:18:57,045
They promise to retrace the route as soon
as they can, but visiting these planets is...

176
00:18:57,127 --> 00:18:58,526
What?

177
00:18:58,607 --> 00:19:00,882
Is what?

178
00:19:01,327 --> 00:19:03,363
Is something.

179
00:19:06,327 --> 00:19:07,726
Yeah.

180
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:19,116
Ship's log update.
I have discovered

181
00:19:19,207 --> 00:19:23,837
that sections of the hull are being
corroded by the gases in this cloud.

182
00:19:23,927 --> 00:19:26,725
Although I have boosted
power to our shields,

183
00:19:26,807 --> 00:19:30,004
it has had little effect
on protecting the ship.

184
00:19:34,847 --> 00:19:37,839
I've sealed off those sections
affected by the corrosion,

185
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,157
but it's only a stopgap measure.

186
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:44,081
All I know for certain is, if I can't
find a way to stop it from spreading,

187
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:47,955
the ship's hull will
eventually be breached.

188
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:50,965
"When the blazing sun is gone,

189
00:19:51,047 --> 00:19:53,959
when he nothing shines upon..."

190
00:19:57,367 --> 00:20:00,564
Who are you? What do you want?

191
00:20:00,647 --> 00:20:02,524
"Then you show your little light,

192
00:20:02,607 --> 00:20:05,280
twinkle, twinkle, all the night."

193
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:07,597
Come on. This way.

194
00:20:08,847 --> 00:20:10,838
Wait...

195
00:20:13,727 --> 00:20:15,957
Samantha.

196
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:18,242
Teal'c, did you see...

197
00:20:19,807 --> 00:20:23,004
- Of course you didn't.
- I'm here to warn you.

198
00:20:23,087 --> 00:20:26,682
- I know. I have to stay awake.
- That's not all.

199
00:20:27,687 --> 00:20:30,201
Everything may not be as it seems.

200
00:20:31,487 --> 00:20:35,526
The fact that I'm talking to someone
who isn't really here kinda speaks to that.

201
00:20:35,607 --> 00:20:38,838
On the contrary.
I think it's you that's not here.

202
00:20:40,487 --> 00:20:41,363
What?

203
00:20:41,447 --> 00:20:46,680
I believe you and the other crew members
are being held aboard the alien vessel.

204
00:20:46,767 --> 00:20:50,840
- How do you know?
- It is possible they are probing your mind.

205
00:20:50,927 --> 00:20:55,125
If so, any information obtained
may be used to attack Earth.

206
00:20:55,207 --> 00:20:57,198
Hold on...

207
00:20:58,447 --> 00:21:01,723
Even if you're right
and I'm not really here,

208
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:04,162
what am I supposed to do about it?

209
00:21:04,247 --> 00:21:05,999
Nothing.

210
00:21:06,087 --> 00:21:08,157
Teal'c, give me something here.

211
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:10,158
Very well.

212
00:21:10,247 --> 00:21:12,602
As you attempt to repair
the ship's engines,

213
00:21:12,687 --> 00:21:18,637
you may inadvertently be divulging vital
information on Prometheus technology.

214
00:21:18,727 --> 00:21:22,117
I do believe it would be
prudent to do nothing.

215
00:21:23,007 --> 00:21:25,601
I can't do that, Teal'c.

216
00:21:28,047 --> 00:21:30,038
Be careful, Samantha.

217
00:21:30,127 --> 00:21:32,516
Wait! Where are you going?

218
00:21:33,807 --> 00:21:37,516
You're wrong, Teal'c.
I'm not on an alien ship.

219
00:21:37,607 --> 00:21:39,598
I'm right here.

220
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:51,402
This is real.

221
00:21:54,567 --> 00:21:56,956
Ow! This is real.

222
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:10,519
The effects of my head injury
are getting worse.

223
00:22:10,607 --> 00:22:13,405
I'm not sure how much longer I can last.

224
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:19,395
My only hope of survival is to somehow
free the Prometheus from this gas cloud

225
00:22:19,487 --> 00:22:23,719
without using either
the sublight or hyperdrive engines.

226
00:22:23,807 --> 00:22:28,085
I think I've come up with a way.
It has its risks.

227
00:22:37,807 --> 00:22:40,560
By venting several levels
of pressurised atmosphere,

228
00:22:40,647 --> 00:22:43,923
I am hoping to generate enough
propulsion to move the ship.

229
00:22:57,647 --> 00:23:00,002
Come on.

230
00:23:07,447 --> 00:23:09,085
No!

231
00:23:17,847 --> 00:23:19,838
Hello?

232
00:23:21,087 --> 00:23:23,078
Are you here?

233
00:23:30,687 --> 00:23:32,962
Hey!

234
00:23:33,047 --> 00:23:36,119
Have I told you my latest theory?
It's really cool.

235
00:23:40,607 --> 00:23:42,086
Lose something?

236
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:43,805
- Did you see a...
- Little girl?

237
00:23:43,887 --> 00:23:45,639
- Yeah.
- No.

238
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,916
- You know, you don't look so good.
- Yeah.

239
00:23:51,007 --> 00:23:52,725
Anyway, about my theory.

240
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:57,085
What if this cloud isn't so much
a collection of corrosive gases

241
00:23:57,167 --> 00:24:00,045
as it is a sentient being?

242
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:03,005
I'm saying the cloud is alive, Sam.

243
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:08,205
- The cloud is alive?
- Yeah. It's a sentient being,

244
00:24:08,287 --> 00:24:13,441
like... feelings, memories.
A space-borne alien entity, if you will.

245
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:18,926
- That's crazy.
- Why else would it be corroding the ship?

246
00:24:19,007 --> 00:24:20,918
Because the gases are corrosive.

247
00:24:21,007 --> 00:24:24,761
Or maybe we somehow offended it
when we flew inside of it.

248
00:24:24,847 --> 00:24:27,998
The point is, if we talk to it...

249
00:24:28,087 --> 00:24:30,885
maybe it'll let us go.

250
00:24:30,967 --> 00:24:33,322
You want me to talk to the cloud?

251
00:24:34,487 --> 00:24:36,682
Would it kill you to try?

252
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:41,045
- How would I do that?
- You said there's a little girl on the ship.

253
00:24:41,127 --> 00:24:45,803
Maybe that little girl is the physical
personification of the cloud.

254
00:24:45,887 --> 00:24:50,403
Just go with me on this. Maybe that's
its way of trying to communicate with us.

255
00:24:50,487 --> 00:24:53,445
Daniel...

256
00:24:53,527 --> 00:24:55,518
This isn't helping.

257
00:24:57,767 --> 00:25:00,201
Talk to her, Sam.

258
00:25:01,047 --> 00:25:06,075
# Like a diamond in the sky

259
00:25:06,687 --> 00:25:12,398
# Twinkle, twinkle, little star

260
00:25:12,487 --> 00:25:18,483
# How I wonder what you are

261
00:25:25,287 --> 00:25:29,280
- My mother used to sing that to me.
- How obscure.

262
00:25:31,007 --> 00:25:35,444
- I'm so tired.
- You can't sleep. Not yet.

263
00:25:35,527 --> 00:25:38,439
- Why?
- Because we need to talk.

264
00:25:55,247 --> 00:25:58,444
Eat. You need to keep your strength up.

265
00:26:00,607 --> 00:26:04,600
- Do you have a name?
- I'm Grace.

266
00:26:06,127 --> 00:26:08,561
- Who are you?
- You know.

267
00:26:09,887 --> 00:26:11,878
No, I don't know.

268
00:26:11,967 --> 00:26:14,356
I'm your father.

269
00:26:16,487 --> 00:26:18,125
Dad?

270
00:26:18,207 --> 00:26:22,200
I know it sounds corny,
but you get to an age...

271
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:31,561
You get to an age where you think about
everything you did wrong as a parent.

272
00:26:34,607 --> 00:26:39,476
- Don't take this the wrong way...
- I know. I don't look so good.

273
00:26:42,047 --> 00:26:45,119
I wanted so many things for you, Sam,

274
00:26:45,207 --> 00:26:47,516
and look what it's brought you instead.

275
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:52,601
Sure. But the massive headache
really takes the edge off it all.

276
00:26:54,767 --> 00:26:56,803
Are you happy, Sam?

277
00:26:56,887 --> 00:26:58,161
What?

278
00:26:58,247 --> 00:27:01,125
Just answer the question.

279
00:27:01,207 --> 00:27:06,645
Well, at the moment things are a little
rough, but in general, sure, I'm happy.

280
00:27:06,727 --> 00:27:11,437
No, you're not.
You're content. You're satisfied.

281
00:27:12,407 --> 00:27:14,523
You're in control.

282
00:27:14,607 --> 00:27:19,806
- And that's the problem.
- OK. I'm really not following here.

283
00:27:19,887 --> 00:27:24,244
I'm saying you're missing
something vital from your life.

284
00:27:24,327 --> 00:27:26,841
The sad part is you have
no idea what I mean.

285
00:27:26,927 --> 00:27:29,282
Dad, I am happy.

286
00:27:30,287 --> 00:27:33,916
I've seen and done things
most people couldn't even dream of.

287
00:27:34,007 --> 00:27:38,558
- I have an incredible life.
- And yet you're alone.

288
00:27:38,647 --> 00:27:43,482
Well, lately the dating scene's
been a little stale, but...

289
00:27:43,567 --> 00:27:45,683
then again I am marooned on a spaceship.

290
00:27:45,767 --> 00:27:48,042
No. Always.

291
00:27:49,967 --> 00:27:52,276
For as long as she was alive,

292
00:27:52,367 --> 00:27:56,963
your mother showed me a world
beyond just ambition and career.

293
00:27:57,047 --> 00:28:00,278
She gave my life meaning and balance.

294
00:28:00,367 --> 00:28:03,882
It was my honour to love her
for the short time she was with me.

295
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:07,516
And if I were young again
and I met her for the first time,

296
00:28:07,607 --> 00:28:09,916
even knowing her fate,

297
00:28:10,007 --> 00:28:12,362
I would do it all over again.

298
00:28:13,007 --> 00:28:15,123
That is love.

299
00:28:18,687 --> 00:28:22,726
Sam, I know you've denied yourself
the experience

300
00:28:22,807 --> 00:28:28,677
because you think it must inevitably
end in pain and loneliness.

301
00:28:35,127 --> 00:28:40,838
It's time to let go of the things that
prevent you from finding happiness.

302
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:44,363
You deserve to love someone...

303
00:28:46,007 --> 00:28:48,043
and be loved in return.

304
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:15,595
Report, Colonel.

305
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:20,158
This one was a bust too. These folks
were more in the dark than the first bunch.

306
00:29:20,247 --> 00:29:23,000
They were indeed a primitive society.

307
00:29:23,087 --> 00:29:28,559
Whatever. They hadn't seen any sign
of the ship. We're oh-for-seven on this, sir.

308
00:29:28,647 --> 00:29:30,524
You heard from the Tok'ra?

309
00:29:30,607 --> 00:29:33,519
They've made an initial trace
of the Prometheus's route.

310
00:29:33,607 --> 00:29:37,316
There's no sign of it at any of
the designated cool-down coordinates.

311
00:29:37,407 --> 00:29:40,843
- Assuming they stayed on course.
- They're expanding the search,

312
00:29:40,927 --> 00:29:44,283
conducting long-range scans of systems
adjacent to the route home.

313
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:48,440
Hopefully, we'll hear
something from them soon.

314
00:30:08,127 --> 00:30:10,118
I don't wanna hear it.

315
00:30:13,327 --> 00:30:15,716
Good. Cos I'm not in the mood.

316
00:30:18,807 --> 00:30:21,321
All right. What?

317
00:30:21,407 --> 00:30:24,558
When Colonel Maybourne and you
were stranded offworld,

318
00:30:24,647 --> 00:30:28,401
Major Carter felt
a similar sense of frustration.

319
00:30:28,487 --> 00:30:32,275
She despaired at the thought
of never seeing you again.

320
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:36,520
- Not you?
- Indeed.

321
00:30:37,447 --> 00:30:39,915
You are like a brother to me, O'Neill.

322
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:43,397
You're like, what, 140?

323
00:30:43,487 --> 00:30:47,639
A younger brother perhaps.
But that is not my point.

324
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:51,923
Look, T, I know what you're trying to do.

325
00:30:54,967 --> 00:30:57,162
And I appreciate it.

326
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,358
Wanna try?

327
00:31:14,087 --> 00:31:15,998
It's fun.

328
00:31:18,807 --> 00:31:23,323
I remember when I was a little girl, I used
to wonder how a bubble could exist.

329
00:31:23,407 --> 00:31:27,320
There's this thing called surface tension.
When molecules bind together...

330
00:31:27,407 --> 00:31:29,079
Boring.

331
00:31:29,167 --> 00:31:31,556
Here, just try.

332
00:31:36,247 --> 00:31:38,317
See? Fun.

333
00:31:38,407 --> 00:31:39,965
Yeah.

334
00:31:40,047 --> 00:31:42,686
All right, Carter. On your feet. Let's go.

335
00:31:43,687 --> 00:31:46,838
I was wondering
when you were gonna show up.

336
00:31:46,927 --> 00:31:50,237
- You just gonna sit there?
- Too tired, sir.

337
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:04,121
Samantha...

338
00:32:04,207 --> 00:32:08,962
I'm a figment of your imagination.
You're gonna call me "sir"?

339
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:11,684
Old habit. Sorry.

340
00:32:11,767 --> 00:32:15,203
- Are you gonna save yourself or what?
- I've tried.

341
00:32:15,287 --> 00:32:19,075
- Just giving up, then?
- I don't know what else to do right now.

342
00:32:19,167 --> 00:32:21,920
You'll think of something.

343
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:24,726
You came to give me a pep talk?

344
00:32:24,807 --> 00:32:27,446
That's what friends are for.

345
00:32:27,527 --> 00:32:29,677
- Friends.
- Hey!

346
00:32:29,767 --> 00:32:33,043
This is you talking here.
Might as well be honest.

347
00:32:34,927 --> 00:32:37,043
What if I quit the air force?

348
00:32:37,127 --> 00:32:41,325
Would that change anything
or is it just an excuse?

349
00:32:41,407 --> 00:32:45,241
- I'd never ask you to give up your career.
- Cos you don't feel anything for me?

350
00:32:45,327 --> 00:32:47,761
- Carter...
- I'd let you go right now if I knew.

351
00:32:47,847 --> 00:32:51,681
- That easy?
- I didn't say it would be easy.

352
00:32:51,767 --> 00:32:54,964
Then what's stopping you,
if you really wanna know?

353
00:32:55,047 --> 00:32:57,038
I'm trying.

354
00:32:57,127 --> 00:32:59,800
Maybe it's not me that's the problem here.

355
00:33:01,407 --> 00:33:03,796
Let's face it, I'm not that complex.

356
00:33:04,767 --> 00:33:07,565
- Me?
- Sam...

357
00:33:08,087 --> 00:33:10,078
I'm a safe bet.

358
00:33:12,927 --> 00:33:17,717
As long as I'm thinking about you, setting
my sights on what I think is unattainable,

359
00:33:17,807 --> 00:33:21,197
there's no chance
of being hurt by someone else.

360
00:33:21,287 --> 00:33:24,404
Jacob was right.

361
00:33:24,487 --> 00:33:26,876
You deserve more.

362
00:33:30,487 --> 00:33:34,685
I will always be there for you,
no matter what.

363
00:33:37,287 --> 00:33:39,278
Believe me.

364
00:33:42,967 --> 00:33:45,242
So what now?

365
00:33:45,327 --> 00:33:47,318
Go save your ass.

366
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:49,925
One last thing.

367
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:01,475
Never mind.

368
00:34:22,447 --> 00:34:25,678
- What do you want?
- What do you mean?

369
00:34:26,447 --> 00:34:30,486
Whoever you are, I know why everyone
else has shown up. Why are you here?

370
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:32,444
What do you want from me?

371
00:34:33,047 --> 00:34:36,164
I don't want anything, but you do.

372
00:34:36,247 --> 00:34:40,365
"Then the traveller in the dark
thanks you for your tiny spark."

373
00:34:40,447 --> 00:34:44,918
"How could he see where to go
if you did not twinkle so?"

374
00:35:00,967 --> 00:35:03,765
- What you looking at?
- It's complicated.

375
00:35:03,847 --> 00:35:05,246
Try me.

376
00:35:05,327 --> 00:35:07,477
I'm gonna try to save myself
with a bubble.

377
00:35:07,567 --> 00:35:09,000
How?

378
00:35:09,087 --> 00:35:12,875
The hyperdrive won't fully engage,
but maybe it doesn't have to.

379
00:35:12,967 --> 00:35:17,882
If I can dial down the power flow, I should
cause a partial shift into hyperspace,

380
00:35:17,967 --> 00:35:20,322
taking the ship out of
the cloud's space-time.

381
00:35:20,407 --> 00:35:23,763
Hopefully, enough to cancel
its effects on the sublight engines.

382
00:35:23,847 --> 00:35:26,236
- Neat.
- Yeah.

383
00:36:12,527 --> 00:36:14,722
Sam, what are you doing?

384
00:36:17,367 --> 00:36:20,200
She's attempting to rescue
her fellow crew members.

385
00:36:20,287 --> 00:36:23,438
That's crazy. Get back to Earth
and then bring in the cavalry.

386
00:36:23,527 --> 00:36:25,199
- There's no time.
- I agree.

387
00:36:25,287 --> 00:36:30,680
- The alien vessel is too formidable.
- Will you guys shut up? Just let her work.

388
00:36:49,727 --> 00:36:54,198
This is Major Samantha Carter
of the US Air Force vessel Prometheus.

389
00:36:54,287 --> 00:36:56,755
Can you hear me?

390
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:03,318
I'm thinking you've been stuck in here
as long as I have.

391
00:37:03,407 --> 00:37:06,160
The only difference is,
I've found a way out.

392
00:37:12,527 --> 00:37:19,126
Here's the deal. Return my crew -
everyone, intact - and let us go,

393
00:37:19,207 --> 00:37:23,405
and I'll help you get outta here.
Do we have a deal?

394
00:37:41,327 --> 00:37:43,477
What the hell just happened?

395
00:37:43,567 --> 00:37:46,957
It's a long story, sir. Just bear with me.

396
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:51,916
I'm activating a hyperspace bubble
to include the alien vessel.

397
00:37:52,007 --> 00:37:55,283
- We're gonna bring it out of the cloud.
- Major?

398
00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:59,762
I'll explain everything soon enough, sir.

399
00:38:11,927 --> 00:38:13,804
Now what?

400
00:38:13,887 --> 00:38:17,118
We see if they keep
their end of the bargain.

401
00:38:30,607 --> 00:38:32,404
Well done, Major.

402
00:38:32,487 --> 00:38:35,081
Sir, I'd like to relieve myself of duty now.

403
00:38:35,167 --> 00:38:36,919
Easy.

404
00:38:37,007 --> 00:38:39,077
Get her to the infirmary.

405
00:39:12,807 --> 00:39:14,877
Hey.

406
00:39:14,967 --> 00:39:16,958
Jack?

407
00:39:17,847 --> 00:39:19,838
Excuse me?

408
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:25,397
Sorry, sir.

409
00:39:25,487 --> 00:39:27,478
Yes, well...

410
00:39:28,327 --> 00:39:33,082
A massive concussion
will tend to disorient one.

411
00:39:34,847 --> 00:39:36,644
How long was I out there?

412
00:39:36,727 --> 00:39:39,560
It's all relative,
that time-space continuum thing.

413
00:39:39,647 --> 00:39:42,286
- Sir.
- Four days.

414
00:39:44,767 --> 00:39:47,998
I could have sworn it was weeks.

415
00:39:48,087 --> 00:39:50,920
Teal'c and Daniel say hi.

416
00:39:51,007 --> 00:39:54,556
They're planning a bit of a shindig
for when you're up and around.

417
00:39:54,647 --> 00:39:57,605
There's talk of cake.

418
00:39:57,687 --> 00:40:00,247
- A cake?
- My idea.

419
00:40:01,287 --> 00:40:03,676
Can't wait.

420
00:40:06,767 --> 00:40:10,362
Need anything? Magazine? Yo-yo?

421
00:40:11,647 --> 00:40:13,717
I'm fine.

422
00:40:13,807 --> 00:40:16,605
Yes, you are.

423
00:40:16,687 --> 00:40:18,678
Thank you, sir.

424
00:40:19,647 --> 00:40:21,638
For what?

425
00:40:24,327 --> 00:40:26,158
Nothing.

426
00:40:26,247 --> 00:40:29,398
Think nothing of it. I've got plenty of that.

427
00:40:40,687 --> 00:40:45,966
# Twinkle, twinkle, little star

428
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:52,966
# How I wonder what you are
