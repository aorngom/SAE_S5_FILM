1
00:00:05,887 --> 00:00:08,401
Previously on "Stargate SG-1":

2
00:00:08,487 --> 00:00:12,036
This is the base of the Tauri.
Why are there Jaffa?

3
00:00:12,127 --> 00:00:15,961
- Rebel warriors.
- Jaffa who've turned against the Goa'uld.

4
00:00:16,047 --> 00:00:19,756
- Is that going to be a problem?
- Not for us.

5
00:00:22,247 --> 00:00:26,160
Somebody want to tell me
what's going on here?

6
00:00:26,247 --> 00:00:27,282
It's history.

7
00:00:27,367 --> 00:00:32,680
For 2,000 years, every time a Tok'ra died
by a staff weapon, a Jaffa was holding it.

8
00:00:33,647 --> 00:00:37,242
This was obviously intended
to be a new form of foot soldier.

9
00:00:37,327 --> 00:00:41,081
I serve Anubis.

10
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:44,523
He's got the strength
and healing powers of a normal Goa'uld,

11
00:00:44,607 --> 00:00:46,916
but none of the normal personality traits.

12
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:51,205
This being was not alive
when it was first grown.

13
00:00:51,287 --> 00:00:52,925
Frankenstein's monster.

14
00:00:53,007 --> 00:00:57,478
Thousands of years ago Goa'uld
found a device created by the Ancients.

15
00:00:57,567 --> 00:01:03,642
With it, maybe we can devise a weapon
to counteract its life-giving energy.

16
00:01:22,287 --> 00:01:24,926
- Where's the matrix crystal?
- By the primaries.

17
00:01:25,007 --> 00:01:28,477
I can't find anything in here.
I had a system at the Alpha site.

18
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:32,401
Its location was compromised when
Anubis used his mind probe on Jonas.

19
00:01:32,487 --> 00:01:37,356
- Did you really want to hang around?
- I want to work as efficiently as possible.

20
00:01:37,447 --> 00:01:41,076
Anubis' drones are kicking the crap
out of the System Lords. We're next.

21
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,635
This prototype should've
been done weeks ago.

22
00:01:43,727 --> 00:01:49,165
- It's done. It's just not... finished.
- Interesting distinction.

23
00:01:49,247 --> 00:01:53,604
We just got Telchak's device. I'm amazed
we came up with something so quickly.

24
00:01:53,687 --> 00:01:58,807
In this form, it's only 70% effective
in countering the reanimation technology.

25
00:01:58,887 --> 00:02:03,438
That's because your power unit hasn't
been properly calibrated. This'll be better.

26
00:02:03,527 --> 00:02:05,882
Maybe.

27
00:02:05,967 --> 00:02:09,437
Have you not had
your coffee this morning?

28
00:02:10,887 --> 00:02:13,606
Selmak doesn't like coffee.

29
00:02:13,687 --> 00:02:17,157
You gave up coffee for your symbiote?

30
00:02:18,207 --> 00:02:21,279
- I didn't know that.
- We never talk any more, Sam.

31
00:02:26,007 --> 00:02:28,123
- What's happening?
- We're under attack.

32
00:02:28,207 --> 00:02:32,564
Goa'uld ships entering the atmosphere.
Colonel Riley's ordered evac to Beta.

33
00:02:32,647 --> 00:02:34,956
We're bugging out right now.

34
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:50,885
What happened?

35
00:03:50,967 --> 00:03:54,118
Approximately 20 minutes ago,
the approach of Goa'uld ships

36
00:03:54,207 --> 00:03:58,325
- prompted evacuation of the Alpha site.
- Sam was doing research there.

37
00:03:58,767 --> 00:04:02,965
She and Jacob were working on a weapon
to neutralise Anubis' new soldiers.

38
00:04:03,047 --> 00:04:05,607
We have no idea what
happened to either of them.

39
00:04:05,687 --> 00:04:09,646
- How many people got out?
- Casualty reports are still coming in,

40
00:04:09,727 --> 00:04:13,436
but 90 are still missing, including
the base commander, Colonel Riley.

41
00:04:13,527 --> 00:04:16,405
I thought the location
of the Alpha site was secret.

42
00:04:16,487 --> 00:04:18,682
It's a completely new address.

43
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:21,725
Evidently the Goa'uld
have discovered its whereabouts.

44
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:24,002
Chevron seven locked.

45
00:04:28,927 --> 00:04:32,715
Wormhole stable, sir.
No radio chatter.

46
00:04:33,487 --> 00:04:36,957
- Send the MALP.
- Yes, sir.

47
00:04:46,927 --> 00:04:49,521
MALP is en route.

48
00:04:49,887 --> 00:04:52,276
Receiving MALP telemetry.

49
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,561
My instruments say
the MALP is on its side.

50
00:04:56,647 --> 00:05:00,162
- You still have camera control?
- Yes, sir.

51
00:05:08,487 --> 00:05:13,561
If the Stargate fell over and it's face down,
the event horizon would've dug a cavity.

52
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,081
When the MALP came through
it fell into the hole.

53
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:18,761
There's no way to know
if the DHD survived.

54
00:05:18,847 --> 00:05:21,725
- If we had another power source...
- We can dial out manually.

55
00:05:21,807 --> 00:05:25,402
- Possibly under enemy fire.
- We'll be fine, sir.

56
00:05:25,487 --> 00:05:28,399
The gate dug the perfect foxhole.

57
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:33,445
- You have a go. Good luck, Colonel.
- Thank you, sir.

58
00:06:12,127 --> 00:06:13,799
Wow.

59
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:17,163
This destruction does not
appear to be from aerial assault.

60
00:06:17,247 --> 00:06:19,203
Single-radius blast.

61
00:06:19,287 --> 00:06:22,006
Quite possibly the self-destruct...

62
00:06:22,687 --> 00:06:26,680
to prevent the Alpha site
from falling into enemy hands.

63
00:06:33,207 --> 00:06:39,203
- So, we'll split up, search for survivors.
- Who could've survived this?

64
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:44,003
- Start with the tree line there.
- Copy.

65
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:46,758
Move out.

66
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:25,724
O'Neill?

67
00:07:30,647 --> 00:07:32,842
What do you got?

68
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:41,722
This is the armour
of one of Anubis' drones.

69
00:07:47,487 --> 00:07:48,556
Reynolds?

70
00:07:52,727 --> 00:07:56,356
- Go ahead.
- Be advised. We may not be alone here.

71
00:07:56,447 --> 00:08:00,804
At least one of Anubis' goons might
have been on the planet when it blew.

72
00:08:00,887 --> 00:08:03,117
Use extreme caution.

73
00:08:03,207 --> 00:08:05,198
Understood.

74
00:08:23,607 --> 00:08:25,325
Colonel.

75
00:08:26,687 --> 00:08:28,882
Major Green. You all right?

76
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:32,926
I'm fine, sir.
We got some serious injuries here.

77
00:08:35,247 --> 00:08:40,037
- Any other survivors in the area?
- As far as I know, we're the only ones, sir.

78
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:44,401
- O'Neill?
- Go ahead.

79
00:08:44,487 --> 00:08:47,923
- Found 12, but they're not in good shape.
- How bad?

80
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:51,238
Some can walk, but most need
immediate medical treatment.

81
00:08:51,327 --> 00:08:53,602
Major Carter with 'em?

82
00:08:57,407 --> 00:08:59,398
I'm afraid not.

83
00:09:03,687 --> 00:09:06,724
SG-3's gonna need help
to get the gate back up.

84
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:11,676
SGs 11 and 21 are assembling now.
I'll be sending them through momentarily.

85
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:16,557
However, that means a delay before I can
send any other resources to help search.

86
00:09:16,647 --> 00:09:18,922
Getting the wounded out is our priority.

87
00:09:19,007 --> 00:09:22,920
Agreed, but if there are any other
survivors they may not have a lot of time.

88
00:09:23,007 --> 00:09:25,396
Understood, sir. We'll keep trying.

89
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,284
Jacob!

90
00:09:43,687 --> 00:09:46,963
- Anubis' drones.
- We know.

91
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:51,518
Take this. It's not 100%,
but it's all we've got.

92
00:09:52,647 --> 00:09:55,445
It only has a few more shots.

93
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:59,322
Sam has a fully-charged power unit.

94
00:09:59,407 --> 00:10:01,716
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

95
00:10:03,847 --> 00:10:06,839
I don't even know if she's still alive.

96
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:34,795
- How are you doing?
- It's nothing Selmak can't handle.

97
00:10:34,887 --> 00:10:37,355
We need to know what happened.

98
00:10:37,447 --> 00:10:40,359
How did Anubis get the location
to the new Alpha site?

99
00:10:40,447 --> 00:10:42,722
I have no idea.

100
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:46,004
I was with Sam when
the self-destruct went off.

101
00:10:46,087 --> 00:10:50,080
One of the drones was
chasing us into the forest.

102
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:56,117
George, if I survived the blast,
you know that thing survived as well.

103
00:10:58,807 --> 00:11:02,482
- What about the prototype weapon?
- I gave it to Colonel O'Neill.

104
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:06,355
But it's only semieffective
in its current configuration.

105
00:11:06,447 --> 00:11:08,677
The upgraded power unit was with Sam.

106
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:12,203
- And we have no idea where she is?
- She's still missing.

107
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:16,166
Is there anything else we can use
against these drones?

108
00:11:16,247 --> 00:11:19,876
Their armour is impervious
to energy weapons and regular firearms.

109
00:11:19,967 --> 00:11:22,276
What about the drones killed in the blast?

110
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:26,406
Kinetic energy, an explosion of that size...
They can't ignore physics.

111
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:31,197
- So with enough kinetic energy...
- It would have to be a lot.

112
00:11:31,287 --> 00:11:36,725
- How about a missile?
- That might do it, if you get close enough.

113
00:11:36,807 --> 00:11:38,684
Sergeant Siler.

114
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:45,206
- Prepare a UAV with UCAV specs.
- Yes, sir.

115
00:11:55,127 --> 00:11:56,845
Am I in trouble, sir?

116
00:11:56,927 --> 00:12:02,399
The Alpha site has been compromised,
indicating we've got a security breach.

117
00:12:02,487 --> 00:12:06,958
The Pentagon is demanding
I launch a formal inquiry immediately.

118
00:12:07,047 --> 00:12:09,163
Just tell me what happened, son.

119
00:12:09,247 --> 00:12:14,162
To tell you the truth, I'm not entirely sure. I
was still at chow when the alarm went off.

120
00:12:14,247 --> 00:12:18,399
By the time I got to the command centre,
Colonel Riley had ordered the evacuation.

121
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,763
- What about the Stargate?
- It was hit by an Alkesh bomber.

122
00:12:21,847 --> 00:12:25,317
We were cut off. That's when
the drones landed in scout ships.

123
00:12:25,407 --> 00:12:27,921
They took all we threw at them
and just kept coming.

124
00:12:28,007 --> 00:12:30,521
So Colonel Riley
ordered the self-destruct?

125
00:12:30,607 --> 00:12:33,167
He knew there was
sensitive material on the base.

126
00:12:33,247 --> 00:12:36,956
He stayed with the device
so the enemy couldn't disarm it.

127
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:42,644
He told the rest of us that we had
one minute to make it to the tree line.

128
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:49,039
- I should've stayed with him.
- You were following orders, Major.

129
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:51,964
Yes, sir.

130
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:56,598
Was there any unusual activity
at the Alpha site in the last few days?

131
00:12:56,687 --> 00:13:00,680
Any unscheduled gate activations
or unexplained signals?

132
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:05,158
- No, sir.
- What about the Jaffa and the Tok'ra?

133
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:10,604
They haven't been getting along very well,
but there's nothing unusual about that.

134
00:13:10,687 --> 00:13:14,157
I want a list of all personnel -
human, Tok'ra and Jaffa -

135
00:13:14,247 --> 00:13:17,444
who've used the Alpha site gate
in the last 48 hours.

136
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:19,519
Yes, sir.

137
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:26,405
Footprints.

138
00:13:34,327 --> 00:13:36,397
Standard issue from the SGC.

139
00:13:36,487 --> 00:13:41,322
Indeed. The depth of the impression
is consistent with Major Carter's size.

140
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:44,717
- There's another set over there.
- Someone much larger.

141
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:46,399
Perhaps a drone.

142
00:13:47,967 --> 00:13:49,002
Yeah.

143
00:13:50,647 --> 00:13:55,084
Do you believe this prototype weapon
will be effective against it?

144
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,762
We'll jump off that bridge
when we come to it.

145
00:14:02,407 --> 00:14:06,685
- So how's the leg?
- Getting there, slowly but surely.

146
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:09,964
Yeah, slowly. The way you heal,
it'll probably take a day.

147
00:14:10,047 --> 00:14:13,596
You didn't come here
to ask me about my leg.

148
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:16,884
You want to know what happened to Sam.

149
00:14:16,967 --> 00:14:18,002
Yeah.

150
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:27,803
The base was under attack. We could
hear the explosions getting closer,

151
00:14:27,887 --> 00:14:31,357
and the sound
of scout ships approaching.

152
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:34,965
- We have to leave now!
- Just gimme a second!

153
00:14:35,047 --> 00:14:39,086
But we had to download the
weapon design into the matrix crystal

154
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:40,998
and wipe the computer memory.

155
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:46,161
- You have the prototype!
- We can't leave this data for them to find.

156
00:14:46,247 --> 00:14:49,239
- How much longer?
- Finished!

157
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,718
It worked.

158
00:15:10,247 --> 00:15:12,363
Not good enough.

159
00:15:15,687 --> 00:15:18,645
Let's get the hell out of here.

160
00:15:18,727 --> 00:15:20,922
The Stargate was hit.

161
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:24,158
We couldn't get out...

162
00:15:24,247 --> 00:15:26,966
so we ran for the hills.

163
00:15:27,407 --> 00:15:29,875
The drone followed us.

164
00:15:31,727 --> 00:15:35,845
If Sam is still alive, it's still after her.

165
00:15:37,047 --> 00:15:40,403
Maybe it was just hiding,
waiting to go back through the gate.

166
00:15:40,487 --> 00:15:46,483
Out of all the rooms on that base,
why did it come to that lab?

167
00:15:48,087 --> 00:15:51,443
And why did it chase us,
as opposed to anyone else?

168
00:15:51,527 --> 00:15:55,281
You think it knew about the prototype?

169
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:59,599
I think that was
the whole reason for the attack.

170
00:15:59,687 --> 00:16:06,286
Anubis knows we have the only weapon
in the galaxy able to stop his soldiers.

171
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:08,722
And Sam has the design.

172
00:16:09,287 --> 00:16:12,882
That thing won't stop until it finds her.

173
00:16:21,967 --> 00:16:24,527
- Sergeant Siler, report.
- It's ready to go.

174
00:16:24,607 --> 00:16:27,679
- Well done. I want it airborne now.
- Yes, sir.

175
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:31,726
General, the leader of the Jaffa survivors
is cleared for debriefing.

176
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:35,686
- I want to speak to him immediately.
- Yes, sir.

177
00:16:39,327 --> 00:16:43,559
- I do not know why I'm being questioned.
- We need to determine what happened.

178
00:16:43,647 --> 00:16:47,720
If you wish to know who betrayed
your base, I suggest you ask the Tok'ra.

179
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,640
- Why do you say that?
- They are without honour.

180
00:16:50,727 --> 00:16:53,560
- They're your allies.
- Then why will they not help us?

181
00:16:53,647 --> 00:16:55,683
- What do you mean?
- Even as we speak,

182
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:58,600
Anubis is moving against
the System Lord Olokun.

183
00:16:58,687 --> 00:17:01,281
Drones slaughter Jaffa
that stand against them.

184
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:04,996
- They are dying for a hopeless cause.
- What's that got to do with the Tok'ra?

185
00:17:05,087 --> 00:17:09,842
We believe they have a spy in Olokun's
higher ranks, close enough to kill him.

186
00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:12,441
The Tok'ra inform us of their operations.

187
00:17:12,527 --> 00:17:16,361
I have no knowledge
of any spy in Olokun's ranks.

188
00:17:16,447 --> 00:17:20,440
Then they are lying to you too. With their
master dead, the siege would be over

189
00:17:20,527 --> 00:17:23,405
and Olokun's Jaffa would be
free to join our movement.

190
00:17:23,487 --> 00:17:30,120
Our logs show that a group of Jaffa left the
site less than 24 hours before the attack.

191
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:33,040
- You sent your own people, didn't you?
- Yes.

192
00:17:33,127 --> 00:17:36,597
- Have they reported back?
- They have not.

193
00:17:36,687 --> 00:17:40,123
- If they were captured by Anubis...
- No Jaffa would yield to torture.

194
00:17:40,207 --> 00:17:42,516
Anubis doesn't have to resort to torture.

195
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:47,158
He has technology that allows him
to simply read a prisoner's mind.

196
00:17:47,247 --> 00:17:52,116
When Heru-ur was killed, I was forced
to pledge allegiance to Apophis.

197
00:17:52,207 --> 00:17:54,846
The slayer of my master
became my master.

198
00:17:54,927 --> 00:17:57,760
So it has been for all Jaffa
for thousands of years.

199
00:17:57,847 --> 00:18:01,806
But now we can choose to fight our
oppressors. We can choose to be free.

200
00:18:01,887 --> 00:18:07,598
I ask only that the Jaffa who serve Olokun
be given that same choice.

201
00:18:08,327 --> 00:18:11,763
If you let me go to the Beta site
to speak to the other survivors,

202
00:18:11,847 --> 00:18:16,443
I may be able to discover
what happened to the Jaffa we sent.

203
00:18:17,407 --> 00:18:19,363
Very well.

204
00:18:22,327 --> 00:18:25,319
- Colonel O'Neill?
- General.

205
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,125
Status report.

206
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:30,836
We found tracks, sir.
They could be Carter's.

207
00:18:30,927 --> 00:18:33,885
- What direction?
- East, up into the hills.

208
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:36,356
The high ground
is a more defensible position.

209
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:41,805
Understood. I'll have the UAV fly a
search pattern in that area. Hammond out.

210
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,605
Jacob.

211
00:19:42,527 --> 00:19:45,758
- Any news on Sam?
- Not yet.

212
00:19:45,847 --> 00:19:50,125
We have a UAV airborne
and all available SG teams are searching.

213
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:56,643
I don't know anyone tougher or more
resourceful. She'll find a way out of this.

214
00:19:58,687 --> 00:20:00,882
How's the investigation going?

215
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:03,356
I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

216
00:20:03,447 --> 00:20:07,520
Do you know anything about
a Tok'ra operative within Olokun's ranks?

217
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:08,676
No.

218
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:11,440
The Jaffa say
you have a spy in his inner circle.

219
00:20:11,527 --> 00:20:13,119
They're mistaken.

220
00:20:13,207 --> 00:20:16,404
Unscheduled offworld activation.

221
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:28,523
Did you learn anything at the Beta site?

222
00:20:28,607 --> 00:20:32,964
Of the Jaffa sent to recruit rebels from
Olokun's army, only one has returned.

223
00:20:33,047 --> 00:20:37,245
The fate of the others is unknown.
Anubis has won a major victory.

224
00:20:37,327 --> 00:20:42,003
Thousands of Jaffa have been killed, and
many of Olokun's commanders captured.

225
00:20:42,087 --> 00:20:44,806
- The Tok'ra spy among them.
- That's impossible.

226
00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:49,085
If we had someone on the inside,
I would've known about it.

227
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:51,158
Are you sure?

228
00:22:20,687 --> 00:22:23,440
Thank you for
your cooperation in this, Delek.

229
00:22:23,527 --> 00:22:26,917
I do not see the need
to continue this investigation, General.

230
00:22:27,007 --> 00:22:29,646
The Jaffa have as much as
admitted responsibility.

231
00:22:29,727 --> 00:22:36,041
All we know is that some of the men
they sent to recruit rebels didn't return.

232
00:22:36,127 --> 00:22:41,121
They were captured in Anubis' latest
offensive. It is the logical explanation.

233
00:22:41,207 --> 00:22:44,802
According to the Jaffa,
a Tok'ra spy was also captured.

234
00:22:45,607 --> 00:22:49,646
We both know Jaffa intelligence
is not always as reliable as it should be.

235
00:22:49,727 --> 00:22:54,403
So you're saying you had
no operative in Olokun's ranks?

236
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:58,205
I am unable to discuss
such matters at present.

237
00:22:58,287 --> 00:23:01,438
The terms of our alliance
dictate full disclosure.

238
00:23:01,527 --> 00:23:03,119
In matters of joint concern.

239
00:23:03,207 --> 00:23:06,165
Security of the Alpha site
is a matter of joint concern.

240
00:23:06,247 --> 00:23:11,560
The disposition of our operatives has no
bearing on the security of the Alpha site.

241
00:23:11,647 --> 00:23:14,320
So you claim.

242
00:23:14,407 --> 00:23:17,080
You have allies amongst
the other nations of Earth.

243
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:18,282
Of course.

244
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:21,518
Do you always practise
full disclosure with them?

245
00:23:21,607 --> 00:23:24,917
We gave you shelter
when you had nowhere else to go.

246
00:23:25,007 --> 00:23:29,637
Because you needed us. Just as you
brought us Telchak's reanimation device

247
00:23:29,727 --> 00:23:34,482
because you needed our help to develop
a weapon against Anubis' drones.

248
00:23:34,567 --> 00:23:37,479
But you are not always so forthcoming.

249
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:44,120
For example, your programme to build
hybrid ships using Goa'uld technologies.

250
00:23:45,247 --> 00:23:47,886
A programme the Tok'ra feel
is extremely unwise.

251
00:23:47,967 --> 00:23:50,765
We need those ships
for the defence of Earth.

252
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:53,236
And so you feel it is
none of our concern.

253
00:23:53,327 --> 00:23:56,603
You see, General, it works both ways.
You ask us to trust

254
00:23:56,687 --> 00:24:02,159
that your headlong pursuit of technologies
that you don't understand poses no threat.

255
00:24:02,247 --> 00:24:07,196
But you fail to offer similar consideration
with our policy on using covert operatives.

256
00:24:07,967 --> 00:24:10,162
Let me ask you something.

257
00:24:10,247 --> 00:24:15,196
How many Tok'ra from the Alpha site
are still unaccounted for?

258
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,120
- Five.
- Do you know how many I'm missing?

259
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,596
64.

260
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:27,356
Believe me, I'm going to get to the bottom
of this, with or without your help.

261
00:25:18,607 --> 00:25:21,075
I've been expecting you.

262
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:26,242
No doubt you've spoken
to General Hammond.

263
00:25:29,007 --> 00:25:32,841
He says he asked you
if we had a spy in Olokun's inner circle.

264
00:25:32,927 --> 00:25:34,406
Yes, he did.

265
00:25:34,487 --> 00:25:39,277
He asked me the same question.
Of course I told him no,

266
00:25:39,367 --> 00:25:43,246
because only the High Council
could make a decision like that,

267
00:25:43,327 --> 00:25:48,481
and since I'm on the High Council,
I would know about it. Wouldn't I?

268
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:51,919
Got something to tell me?

269
00:25:52,007 --> 00:25:55,841
If you have a concern, you can
take it up with the Council yourself.

270
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:01,237
- Who do you think you're talking to?
- An interesting question.

271
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:04,319
It seems I am talking to a human host.

272
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:11,562
Make no mistake, Delek.

273
00:26:11,647 --> 00:26:17,483
I am still Selmak, and I was a leader of the
Tok'ra before you had even taken a host.

274
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:20,286
Maybe you've been a leader too long.

275
00:26:20,367 --> 00:26:22,756
The Tauri are unlike
other humans in the galaxy.

276
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:26,726
Their will has not been eroded
by thousands of years of slavery.

277
00:26:26,807 --> 00:26:31,164
This can be a valuable asset,
but it can also make them dangerous.

278
00:26:31,247 --> 00:26:32,965
Particularly as hosts.

279
00:26:33,047 --> 00:26:36,881
Jacob Carter has had no more
influence on me than any other host.

280
00:26:36,967 --> 00:26:39,117
There are those of us
who would disagree.

281
00:26:39,207 --> 00:26:42,483
You have allowed yourself
to get too close to these people.

282
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:45,639
Your true loyalties are in question.

283
00:26:47,047 --> 00:26:50,642
You speak for the entire Council?

284
00:26:50,727 --> 00:26:56,359
You still have your defenders,
although their numbers are diminishing.

285
00:26:56,447 --> 00:27:00,918
So you did meet without me.
And you did send an operative.

286
00:27:01,007 --> 00:27:04,716
And if you had known,
would you have told General Hammond?

287
00:27:04,807 --> 00:27:07,799
They have a right to know.

288
00:27:07,887 --> 00:27:13,837
We knew you would feel that way, which
is precisely why you were not informed.

289
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:24,479
So Delek admits that
this spy has gone missing.

290
00:27:24,567 --> 00:27:25,556
Yes.

291
00:27:25,647 --> 00:27:30,482
But the Tok'ra will never acknowledge
that he could have been responsible.

292
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:34,242
Tok'ra operatives have orders
never to be taken alive.

293
00:27:34,327 --> 00:27:36,045
What about a sarcophagus?

294
00:27:36,127 --> 00:27:42,157
They take precautions to ensure the brain
is not left intact. No revival is possible.

295
00:27:42,247 --> 00:27:45,205
This is all assuming
the man wasn't taken unawares.

296
00:27:45,287 --> 00:27:49,200
The system isn't foolproof,
but they won't admit that.

297
00:27:49,287 --> 00:27:54,725
The truth is, I don't think you'll ever
find out who was responsible for the leak.

298
00:27:55,247 --> 00:28:00,037
It could've been the Tok'ra or the Jaffa.
It could've been both. Look...

299
00:28:00,127 --> 00:28:05,918
I've helped as much as I can with this, but
now I'd like to get back to join the search.

300
00:28:06,007 --> 00:28:09,443
- I need you here.
- I already told you, I'm out of the loop.

301
00:28:09,527 --> 00:28:13,645
They don't trust me any more. They think
my emotions are clouding my judgment.

302
00:28:13,727 --> 00:28:19,677
Ironic, considering I'm wasting time while
my daughter is being hunted by that thing.

303
00:28:19,767 --> 00:28:22,839
We have our best people on this.
They will find her.

304
00:28:22,927 --> 00:28:26,158
- What do I do until then?
- I just got a report from the Beta site.

305
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:31,082
The Jaffa are blaming the Tok'ra for what
happened. There have been altercations.

306
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:35,604
If I can't get the situation under control,
I have orders to expel them all.

307
00:28:35,687 --> 00:28:38,565
Our alliance is falling apart.

308
00:28:39,487 --> 00:28:43,844
I need someone to bridge the gap,
someone to be the voice of reason.

309
00:28:43,927 --> 00:28:46,043
I need you.

310
00:29:32,407 --> 00:29:34,796
- O'Neill?
- Go ahead.

311
00:29:34,887 --> 00:29:37,560
The UAV has been
shot down in your area.

312
00:29:37,647 --> 00:29:44,439
It's four clicks away on a heading of
320 degrees from your present location.

313
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:47,079
We're on it.

314
00:29:57,127 --> 00:29:59,766
Why have you asked me here?

315
00:30:03,727 --> 00:30:06,241
- You know what's happening at Beta site.
- I do.

316
00:30:06,327 --> 00:30:09,763
We need your help to put a stop to it
before it gets out of hand.

317
00:30:09,847 --> 00:30:13,396
You're a leader amongst the Jaffa.
They'll listen to you.

318
00:30:15,127 --> 00:30:20,121
What should I say? They must continue
to bear the arrogance of the Tok'ra?

319
00:30:20,207 --> 00:30:25,645
They must be subservient to those who
had sacrificed so many of their brothers?

320
00:30:27,727 --> 00:30:31,083
The Jaffa have always been
dependent on the Goa'uld

321
00:30:31,167 --> 00:30:34,284
because they need symbiotes
to sustain them.

322
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:36,835
But now there is
a substance called tretonin,

323
00:30:36,927 --> 00:30:39,646
which can free the Jaffa
from this dependence.

324
00:30:39,727 --> 00:30:41,763
I am aware of its significance.

325
00:30:41,847 --> 00:30:47,638
Are you also aware that millions of
Tok'ra symbiotes died in its development,

326
00:30:47,727 --> 00:30:50,685
including our beloved Queen Egeria,

327
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:54,760
the queen from whom
all our lineage can be traced?

328
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:58,235
- I was not.
- For the first time,

329
00:30:58,327 --> 00:31:04,800
the Tok'ra have fought alongside the Jaffa
and the Tauri, and it's made a difference.

330
00:31:04,887 --> 00:31:11,360
More System Lords have fallen in the past
seven years than in the 700 years before.

331
00:31:11,447 --> 00:31:14,439
It is true that together we are strong.

332
00:31:14,527 --> 00:31:17,439
And, divided, we will die.

333
00:31:26,967 --> 00:31:29,356
We cannot let our alliance end.

334
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:32,361
Your words are wise,

335
00:31:32,447 --> 00:31:36,884
but my time at the Alpha site
has taught me some bitter lessons.

336
00:31:36,967 --> 00:31:41,040
I suspect that you
do not speak for all the Tok'ra.

337
00:31:44,047 --> 00:31:45,082
No.

338
00:31:46,047 --> 00:31:51,280
Until the others feel as you do,
reconciliation may not be possible.

339
00:32:52,767 --> 00:32:58,797
Gentlemen, we need your help to keep the
situation at Beta from getting out of hand.

340
00:32:58,887 --> 00:33:03,836
I'm not sure what you expect of the
Tok'ra. We've had unprovoked assaults.

341
00:33:03,927 --> 00:33:08,205
Unprovoked? You refused to help us
and thousands of Jaffa died needlessly.

342
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:12,917
- Assassinating Olokun was not an option.
- Why not?

343
00:33:13,007 --> 00:33:16,079
We didn't know how many Jaffa
would join the rebels.

344
00:33:16,167 --> 00:33:18,840
We could have delivered
an army into Anubis' hands.

345
00:33:18,927 --> 00:33:22,442
They deserved the right to choose.
Instead, they were slaughtered.

346
00:33:22,527 --> 00:33:25,121
We have fought the Goa'uld
for thousands of years.

347
00:33:25,207 --> 00:33:27,482
You have no right
to question our methods.

348
00:33:27,567 --> 00:33:30,035
You were alone.
You have allies now.

349
00:33:30,127 --> 00:33:31,924
What good has it done us?

350
00:33:32,007 --> 00:33:36,717
Since we have been allies, your tendency
to provoke confrontation with the Goa'uld

351
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:40,595
has resulted in the deaths of more Tok'ra
than in the previous hundred years.

352
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:43,360
I hate to admit it,
but he's got a point.

353
00:33:43,447 --> 00:33:48,202
When a human or a Jaffa dies,
more are born to take their place.

354
00:33:48,287 --> 00:33:50,084
Not so for the Tok'ra.

355
00:33:50,167 --> 00:33:54,797
Our Queen Egeria, from whom
all Tok'ra have spawned, is dead.

356
00:33:54,887 --> 00:33:57,355
Our numbers are dwindling.

357
00:33:57,447 --> 00:34:01,679
This alliance may simply
be something we cannot afford.

358
00:36:10,327 --> 00:36:13,160
Carter, I need the...

359
00:36:13,247 --> 00:36:15,636
Thanks.

360
00:36:35,967 --> 00:36:38,197
Cover him.

361
00:36:39,007 --> 00:36:40,884
Is it...

362
00:36:42,247 --> 00:36:44,477
Yeah, he's dead.

363
00:36:47,447 --> 00:36:49,915
Right, Teal'c? He's dead?

364
00:36:51,767 --> 00:36:53,758
Yeah, he's dead.

365
00:37:00,967 --> 00:37:03,162
Wanna get up?

366
00:37:03,247 --> 00:37:05,841
I just need to rest for a minute.

367
00:37:23,447 --> 00:37:25,802
Come here.

368
00:37:53,367 --> 00:37:57,280
First of all, we'd like to congratulate
you on the recovery of Major Carter.

369
00:37:57,367 --> 00:38:00,165
- We are glad to know that she is safe.
- Thank you.

370
00:38:00,247 --> 00:38:04,559
I have spoken to the High Council with
regard to the situation at the Beta site.

371
00:38:04,647 --> 00:38:09,437
- They believe the best solution is to leave.
- Is that really necessary?

372
00:38:09,527 --> 00:38:11,916
If this partnership were to continue,

373
00:38:12,007 --> 00:38:15,238
you would insist on full disclosure
of our covert operations.

374
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:17,602
I'm afraid that's non-negotiable.

375
00:38:17,687 --> 00:38:19,882
In that case, we must refuse.

376
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:24,006
Secrecy is our only weapon.
It's all we've ever known.

377
00:38:24,087 --> 00:38:26,123
The Jaffa, too, will be leaving.

378
00:38:26,207 --> 00:38:30,758
- But with the Tok'ra gone...
- We are not leaving because of them.

379
00:38:30,847 --> 00:38:33,156
We are leaving because
it is what we must do.

380
00:38:33,247 --> 00:38:38,002
On your base, you dictate the terms. We
must consult you before we take action.

381
00:38:38,087 --> 00:38:41,875
There are those among us who feel
we simply traded one master for another.

382
00:38:41,967 --> 00:38:46,597
We're not trying to tell you what to do. We
simply think it's vital to coordinate efforts.

383
00:38:46,687 --> 00:38:51,283
Unlike the Tauri or the Tok'ra, the Jaffa
are still learning what it means to be free.

384
00:38:51,367 --> 00:38:56,077
To do this, we must have our own bases,
our own leaders, our own communities.

385
00:38:56,167 --> 00:39:00,046
We must do this for ourselves,
or it would have no meaning.

386
00:39:00,127 --> 00:39:02,800
Only then can we be
equal partners in any alliance.

387
00:39:02,887 --> 00:39:05,276
I'm sorry, this is nuts.

388
00:39:05,367 --> 00:39:09,599
My friend almost died so we could get
a weapon able to stop Anubis' soldiers.

389
00:39:09,687 --> 00:39:13,680
Now we're finally able to really make
a difference, and you want to walk away?

390
00:39:13,767 --> 00:39:15,803
I'm sorry, Dr Jackson.

391
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:18,276
This is how it must be.

392
00:39:36,887 --> 00:39:38,878
Hiya, kid.

393
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:42,761
You were asleep for a long time.

394
00:39:43,527 --> 00:39:45,597
You gave me quite a scare.

395
00:39:45,687 --> 00:39:47,245
Sorry.

396
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:51,044
Jack told me what happened.

397
00:39:51,127 --> 00:39:53,322
I'm proud of you.

398
00:39:55,687 --> 00:40:01,637
Look, Sam... I may not be able to come
around as much for the next little while.

399
00:40:02,927 --> 00:40:07,000
- What do you mean?
- Things kind of got screwed up.

400
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:10,397
The alliance is in trouble.

401
00:40:10,487 --> 00:40:14,162
- I don't understand.
- You don't need to know the details.

402
00:40:14,247 --> 00:40:18,843
Let's just say we're going
our separate ways for a while.

403
00:40:19,807 --> 00:40:24,835
If I stay with the Tok'ra,
I can at least try to mend some fences.

404
00:40:26,847 --> 00:40:28,883
Are you sure?

405
00:40:28,967 --> 00:40:32,084
I'm not ready to give up on this just yet.

406
00:40:40,687 --> 00:40:43,838
Don't worry, I'll be back eventually.

407
00:40:45,887 --> 00:40:48,037
I'll miss you.

408
00:40:48,127 --> 00:40:50,357
I'll miss you, too.

409
