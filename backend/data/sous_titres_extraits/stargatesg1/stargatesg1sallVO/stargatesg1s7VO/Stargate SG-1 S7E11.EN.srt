1
00:00:14,087 --> 00:00:17,079
These warriors
are of both Ramius and Tilgath.

2
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:20,443
This meeting did not go well.

3
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:25,161
Some of these warriors
have been shot in the back.

4
00:00:25,247 --> 00:00:30,321
- They were killed while retreating.
- There was no honour in this battle.

5
00:00:31,087 --> 00:00:33,078
Tilgath.

6
00:00:37,367 --> 00:00:40,837
Ramius must have betrayed
their allegiance.

7
00:00:40,927 --> 00:00:42,918
The first prime of Ramius.

8
00:00:47,527 --> 00:00:50,087
- He is alive.
- You must go from this place.

9
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:52,601
Why did your master
betray Tilgath? Speak.

10
00:00:52,687 --> 00:00:56,441
We came to forge an alliance.
My master did not do this.

11
00:00:56,527 --> 00:00:58,324
He barely escaped alive.

12
00:00:58,407 --> 00:01:01,524
- Then what happened here?
- One warrior. You must...

13
00:03:32,327 --> 00:03:35,922
- What happened out there?
- Our intelligence was correct.

14
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,760
A summit between
Ramius and Tilgath did take place.

15
00:03:38,847 --> 00:03:41,520
However, when we arrived,
Ramius had fled.

16
00:03:41,607 --> 00:03:45,156
All those who remained had been slain,
including Tilgath.

17
00:03:45,247 --> 00:03:49,684
- By this one man alone?
- From how he fought us, I do not doubt it.

18
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:51,325
An Ashrak?

19
00:03:52,647 --> 00:03:57,038
- He was unlike any warrior we have met.
- Obviously, you took him down.

20
00:03:57,127 --> 00:03:59,925
He withstood the brunt of our fire
before succumbing.

21
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:03,124
Its armour must protect it
from energy-based weapons.

22
00:04:03,207 --> 00:04:06,483
If so, we could be dealing with
a new kind of technology.

23
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:09,798
And this wasn't a setup
by Ramius to kill Tilgath?

24
00:04:09,887 --> 00:04:12,481
Ramius' Jaffa were equally as decimated.

25
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:15,843
His first prime said
his master barely escaped alive.

26
00:04:15,927 --> 00:04:20,159
So, obviously, someone found out
about the alliance and wanted to stop it.

27
00:04:20,247 --> 00:04:25,560
- Major, run whatever tests you have to.
- I'd like to call the Tok'ra in on this, sir.

28
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:30,323
Do it. I wanna know
everything we can about this warrior.

29
00:04:41,127 --> 00:04:43,322
The suit must be affecting the MRI.

30
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:47,525
As long as he's wearing that armour,
we won't learn anything more.

31
00:04:50,527 --> 00:04:55,317
His helmet is made up of two pieces.
Pass me those forceps.

32
00:05:18,327 --> 00:05:20,397
Looks like he's fused into the suit.

33
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:24,605
Some sort of breathing filtration system.

34
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:44,925
It's a Goa'uld. Quite frankly,
that's not as shocking as the host.

35
00:05:45,007 --> 00:05:48,841
- How so?
- It has an unusual organ structure.

36
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,918
Everything's out of proportion.

37
00:05:51,007 --> 00:05:54,283
Physiologically, the heart and lungs
had to be abnormally large

38
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:57,006
to supply enough blood and oxygen
to its muscles.

39
00:05:57,087 --> 00:06:02,719
Someone tried to genetically engineer the
perfect athlete, with no care for longevity.

40
00:06:02,807 --> 00:06:05,401
Leaving it to the symbiote
to sustain its life.

41
00:06:05,487 --> 00:06:08,797
- An engineered host.
- A seriously flawed one.

42
00:06:08,887 --> 00:06:12,516
Even a Goa'uld symbiote
wouldn't be able to compensate for long.

43
00:06:12,607 --> 00:06:15,201
We're still analysing genetic data,

44
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:21,476
but for now we can tell you there was
no evident trauma from energy weapons.

45
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:22,966
What does that mean?

46
00:06:23,047 --> 00:06:27,757
The warrior's armour appears to possess
advanced energy-absorption technology.

47
00:06:27,847 --> 00:06:33,001
If it works how I think it does, it wouldn't
matter how many blasts were fired at it.

48
00:06:33,087 --> 00:06:37,524
- Nothing would get through.
- So Teal'c and Bra'tac didn't kill it?

49
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:39,006
Yes, sir.

50
00:06:39,087 --> 00:06:43,638
Apparently, the host was on the verge of a
pulmonary failure long before it met them.

51
00:06:43,727 --> 00:06:46,241
It had a heart attack?

52
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:49,524
Sorry, Teal'c. You didn't stop it.

53
00:06:49,607 --> 00:06:51,643
You and Bra'tac just got lucky.

54
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:58,442
Its entire cellular structure
is less than three weeks old.

55
00:06:58,527 --> 00:07:03,760
It is organic,
but it was definitely created in a lab.

56
00:07:03,847 --> 00:07:08,557
We know the Goa'uld have been trying
to perfect a host superior to humans.

57
00:07:08,647 --> 00:07:12,560
This is definitely stronger than humans,
but it's far from superior.

58
00:07:12,647 --> 00:07:15,639
Traditionally,
the Goa'uld are also somewhat vain.

59
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:19,163
This was obviously intended to be
a new form of foot soldier,

60
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:22,637
possibly a reaction
to the recent uprising of the Jaffa.

61
00:07:22,727 --> 00:07:28,916
What's most interesting is that this being
was not alive when it was first grown.

62
00:07:29,007 --> 00:07:32,602
It was given life
after it reached its mature state.

63
00:07:32,687 --> 00:07:34,917
Frankenstein's monster.

64
00:07:35,007 --> 00:07:37,202
How do you know that?

65
00:07:38,687 --> 00:07:43,044
Remnants of a unique
energy signature within its cells.

66
00:07:43,127 --> 00:07:47,245
It's similar to the residual effects
left by the use of a sarcophagus.

67
00:07:47,327 --> 00:07:49,921
Could it give life to something
that was never alive?

68
00:07:50,007 --> 00:07:56,276
No, a sarcophagus is designed to boost
health or heal someone terminally injured.

69
00:07:56,367 --> 00:08:00,724
- They cannot animate non-living cells.
- Then what could have?

70
00:08:00,807 --> 00:08:05,927
Thousands of years ago a Goa'uld found a
device originally created by the Ancients.

71
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:08,805
He determined
its primary purpose was to heal,

72
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:13,324
but it was so powerful, its effects
on human hosts proved devastating.

73
00:08:13,407 --> 00:08:16,080
However, after much experimentation,

74
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:20,399
the Goa'uld was able to use the
technology to make the first sarcophagus.

75
00:08:20,487 --> 00:08:23,399
But couldn't eliminate
all its negative side effects.

76
00:08:23,487 --> 00:08:25,557
The Tok'ra have long sought this device

77
00:08:25,647 --> 00:08:29,083
in the hope of using it
to perfect the sarcophagus technology,

78
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:31,158
so that we could all benefit from it.

79
00:08:31,247 --> 00:08:34,876
Now it may be the key
to fighting this new warrior.

80
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:38,277
- How?
- With it, we could devise a weapon

81
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:41,564
to counteract this life-giving energy.

82
00:08:42,727 --> 00:08:47,198
- Who was the first Goa'uld to find it?
- His name was Telchak.

83
00:08:47,287 --> 00:08:49,278
Telchak.

84
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:53,280
Nicholas Ballard,
my, uh, grandfather.

85
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:57,155
One of Nick's obsessions was
finding the so-called Fountain of Youth.

86
00:08:57,247 --> 00:09:00,398
He claimed he'd found out
the source of the fountain's power

87
00:09:00,487 --> 00:09:05,242
was a piece of alien technology used by
early Mayan tribes around 900 BC.

88
00:09:05,327 --> 00:09:08,160
Nick traced its origins to Chac,
the Mayan god of rain.

89
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,841
You think Chac may have been Telchak?

90
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:14,761
- Just a hunch.
- Maybe not just a hunch.

91
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:18,760
- The device's main function was to heal.
- For the Ancients.

92
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:23,682
For humans to see an effect, it would be
from limited exposure at a safe distance.

93
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:28,841
Still, if it was hidden near a water source,
it could be the basis of the mythology.

94
00:09:28,927 --> 00:09:31,760
Nick believed Chac's temple
was in Central America.

95
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:34,884
He spent decades searching for it,
but came up empty.

96
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:36,958
His notes are mostly indecipherable.

97
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:42,883
The only mention of the temple's location
is somewhere near a waterfall in a river.

98
00:09:44,247 --> 00:09:48,206
This is written in
an obscure dialect of Goa'uld.

99
00:09:51,247 --> 00:09:53,363
- So where is it?
- It's here.

100
00:09:53,447 --> 00:09:56,166
If Selmak's right,
it's in southern Honduras.

101
00:09:56,247 --> 00:09:58,681
How can we be certain
the device is there?

102
00:09:58,767 --> 00:10:00,086
We can't, but, um...

103
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:03,079
We think we know
who created the Goa'uld warrior.

104
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:05,476
- Telchak?
- No.

105
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:07,842
Telchak created the sarcophagus.

106
00:10:07,927 --> 00:10:11,556
Anubis went to war with him
for possession of the original device.

107
00:10:11,647 --> 00:10:13,922
That was before Anubis tried to ascend.

108
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:18,080
Anubis defeated Telchak,
but he never did find the device.

109
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:21,079
It was believed to be hidden
in one of Telchak's temples.

110
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:23,158
You think Anubis is behind this?

111
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:28,162
He knew about the technology. He never
found the device, but he wouldn't need to.

112
00:10:28,247 --> 00:10:32,001
He would've gained the knowledge
when he ascended and built a new one.

113
00:10:32,087 --> 00:10:36,205
- Still, it's only a guess.
- Yeah, but it's a good one.

114
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:40,803
The good news is, sir, the original Ancient
device is probably still here on Earth.

115
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:44,118
If we could analyse
the technology of this device,

116
00:10:44,207 --> 00:10:48,120
it might be possible to engineer a weapon
to use against these warriors.

117
00:10:48,207 --> 00:10:52,086
Not to mention the possibility
of harnessing its power to heal.

118
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:56,285
Very well. Dr Jackson,
take Dr Lee and see what you can find.

119
00:10:56,367 --> 00:10:58,358
Dismissed.

120
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:16,716
- Are you sure this is the right place?
- This is where he said he'd be.

121
00:11:16,807 --> 00:11:22,006
- What if he doesn't show up?
- We have a few beers, make friends.

122
00:11:29,967 --> 00:11:32,481
Hola/ Muy buenos días, caballeros.

123
00:11:33,647 --> 00:11:35,842
¿Una cerveza? ¿Una tequila?

124
00:11:35,927 --> 00:11:41,240
De hecho, estamos buscando a un guía
llamado Rogelio. Él quedo de vernos aquí.

125
00:11:41,327 --> 00:11:44,205
Pedro, hazte cargo, tío/

126
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:48,519
I am Rogelio.
Rogelio Duran, at your service.

127
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,041
This is just my day job.

128
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,597
- You must be Dr Jackson.
- That's right. This is Dr Lee.

129
00:11:54,687 --> 00:11:57,247
- Buenos días.
- Encantado.

130
00:11:57,327 --> 00:12:00,000
So, you guys wanna see some temples?

131
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:04,160
Actually, we wanna see
one temple in particular.

132
00:12:06,447 --> 00:12:07,766
Here.

133
00:12:07,847 --> 00:12:11,317
I'm sorry to tell you this, señor,
but there are no temples there.

134
00:12:11,407 --> 00:12:16,117
You wanna go north. That's where
all the good stuff is. There's lots of ruins.

135
00:12:16,207 --> 00:12:19,199
My cousin has a truck.
We could be there in five hours.

136
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:23,200
Yeah, I'm sure the north is great,
but we really wanna go here.

137
00:12:23,287 --> 00:12:26,723
Señor, I have been to this part
of the country many times.

138
00:12:26,807 --> 00:12:31,164
There is nothing there, I promise you.
North. That's where you wanna go.

139
00:12:31,247 --> 00:12:34,205
Either you take us south,
or we'll find someone who will.

140
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:37,836
OK, OK, OK. It's your money.

141
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:44,555
- You say your cousin has a truck?
- Simone. His house is around the corner.

142
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:48,720
Of course, there is the issue
of filling the tank with gas.

143
00:13:06,447 --> 00:13:08,881
OK! Now we're talking business.

144
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:13,757
- Let's go, gentlemen.
- Um, look, I need a receipt or something...

145
00:13:16,047 --> 00:13:18,641
If Anubis is truly behind this,

146
00:13:18,727 --> 00:13:22,959
then his strategy is to assassinate
any minor Goa'ulds vulnerable to attack,

147
00:13:23,047 --> 00:13:28,440
absorbing their troops in preparation
for battle with Ba'al and the System Lords.

148
00:13:28,527 --> 00:13:31,360
How many minor Goa'ulds
have suffered attacks?

149
00:13:31,447 --> 00:13:35,076
At least three.
These new warriors are devastating.

150
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:37,601
- Do we know where they're coming from?
- No.

151
00:13:37,687 --> 00:13:41,123
Our fear is it's only a matter of time
before Anubis targets Earth.

152
00:13:41,207 --> 00:13:47,476
These beings are a threat to all who hope
to one day see the Goa'uld defeated.

153
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,207
If Dr Jackson can recover this device...

154
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:54,360
Even if he does, there is no guarantee
the Tok'ra can devise a weapon

155
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:56,961
that can fend off these warriors.

156
00:13:57,047 --> 00:14:00,801
We only learned a limited amount
from our study of the warrior's armour.

157
00:14:00,887 --> 00:14:03,640
The only way to learn more
is through interrogation.

158
00:14:03,727 --> 00:14:07,322
Which means
we have to capture one alive.

159
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,518
What have we got, Major?

160
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:20,600
The warrior's armour can resist
our strongest armour-piercing weapons,

161
00:14:20,687 --> 00:14:23,042
as well as absorb energy-weapon fire.

162
00:14:23,127 --> 00:14:27,837
However, the material is made up
of a close-knit fibre similar to Kevlar,

163
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:31,522
meaning something small and sharp
should be able to penetrate it,

164
00:14:31,607 --> 00:14:33,916
such as a fine-tipped trinium dart.

165
00:14:40,287 --> 00:14:44,280
Bra'tac says the fact that Ramius
is still alive makes him a likely target.

166
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:48,565
There are enough rebel Jaffa under
his command to gain access to the planet.

167
00:14:48,647 --> 00:14:54,199
We stake out the gate on Ramius's planet
and capture a warrior that comes through.

168
00:14:54,847 --> 00:14:57,725
What if one doesn't come through?

169
00:14:57,807 --> 00:15:00,002
Well, we come home, I suppose.

170
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:04,840
But let's say Bra'tac is right.
We meet his contacts on Ramius's planet,

171
00:15:04,927 --> 00:15:11,162
set up an ambush using a force field to
trap a warrior, and hit it with tranquillisers.

172
00:15:11,247 --> 00:15:15,559
- How does a dart get through the shield?
- They're one-way. They keep things in.

173
00:15:15,647 --> 00:15:17,444
Ah.

174
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:24,757
- So what do you think?
- I have some notes.

175
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:45,566
According to the map,
we're in the right place, but, uh...

176
00:15:45,647 --> 00:15:47,638
This makes no sense.

177
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:55,076
The legend of the Fountain of Youth
says all water flows towards it.

178
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:56,964
How's that possible?

179
00:15:57,047 --> 00:16:01,404
Maybe the device has special properties,
maybe it's superstition,

180
00:16:01,487 --> 00:16:07,323
or it means the flow from that waterfall
flows in the direction of the temple.

181
00:16:07,407 --> 00:16:11,002
- Well, it should be right here, but...
- Nobody ever listens to me.

182
00:16:11,087 --> 00:16:15,319
I tell them there are no temples out here,
but they come out here anyways.

183
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,204
Now, the north has roads.

184
00:16:17,287 --> 00:16:21,246
We could drive to any temple we want,
but instead we're in this jungle.

185
00:16:21,327 --> 00:16:25,843
Yeah, OK.
Let's spread out, look for a... temple.

186
00:16:25,927 --> 00:16:32,275
In lieu of that, a marker of some kind.
Anything that might tell us where to go.

187
00:16:34,287 --> 00:16:35,766
Go.

188
00:16:39,447 --> 00:16:40,846
Agh!

189
00:16:42,047 --> 00:16:44,117
Found it!

190
00:16:53,407 --> 00:16:58,481
This is the best spot for your ambush.
This path leads to the pyramid of Ramius.

191
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:02,606
I will go now to ensure that
your eventual escape will be undetected.

192
00:17:02,687 --> 00:17:04,086
Brother.

193
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:07,318
Tek matte, Master Bra'tac.
It is an honour to be in your service.

194
00:17:07,407 --> 00:17:09,875
Many thanks, Adal. Chel nok.

195
00:17:11,327 --> 00:17:13,716
Right, Carter, do your thing.

196
00:17:13,807 --> 00:17:17,243
Reynolds, I want flanking positions
set up on either side.

197
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:21,923
- Ring the perimeter with claymores.
- Not much faith in plan A?

198
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:24,567
Since when has plan A ever worked?

199
00:17:24,647 --> 00:17:26,444
Right.

200
00:17:34,727 --> 00:17:37,082
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

201
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:40,842
At least you were right
about there being something here.

202
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:45,079
We're gonna go look around. Stay put.

203
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:47,761
You got it, señor. Have fun.

204
00:17:53,527 --> 00:17:56,405
This is definitely early Mayan stonework.

205
00:17:56,487 --> 00:17:58,478
Oh, yeah.

206
00:18:14,047 --> 00:18:17,926
SG-3 Sierra, this is SG-1 Niner.
What's your status?

207
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:22,523
We're maintaining position.
Stargate is secure. No activity.

208
00:18:26,447 --> 00:18:28,836
Maybe we should start a pool.

209
00:18:34,927 --> 00:18:40,126
Is this cramped thing getting to you? Why
make these passageways so narrow?

210
00:18:40,207 --> 00:18:43,119
Maybe they were skinny people.

211
00:18:43,607 --> 00:18:46,246
And the roof, too.
Ow, my head. God!

212
00:18:46,327 --> 00:18:48,318
Skinny, short people.

213
00:18:56,487 --> 00:19:01,402
- It's a dead end.
- There's nothing on the walls or ceiling,

214
00:19:01,487 --> 00:19:06,436
no glyphs, no seals, no Ancient script,
not even a pictograph.

215
00:19:06,527 --> 00:19:08,916
Isn't there always writing?

216
00:19:13,207 --> 00:19:16,995
You know, I mean, somewhere
there's bound to be... Maybe not.

217
00:19:17,087 --> 00:19:19,555
SG-1 Niner, this is SG-3 Sierra.

218
00:19:19,647 --> 00:19:23,083
Target has come through the gate
and is en route to your position.

219
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:25,283
Right, heads up.

220
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:45,759
Do it.

221
00:20:02,487 --> 00:20:04,876
- Carter?
- I don't understand, sir.

222
00:20:04,967 --> 00:20:08,118
- Hit him again?
- A third dart could kill. We want him alive.

223
00:20:13,927 --> 00:20:15,758
Son of a bitch.

224
00:20:43,247 --> 00:20:45,238
Fire in the hole!

225
00:21:01,047 --> 00:21:02,878
C4!

226
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:29,759
Sir, our position's been made.

227
00:21:29,847 --> 00:21:31,963
Grab the wounded and saddle up.

228
00:21:35,487 --> 00:21:39,639
SG-3 Sierra, dial the gate.
We're aborting the mission.

229
00:21:39,727 --> 00:21:43,686
Negative, SG-1. We have major
unfriendly Jaffa closing in on our position.

230
00:21:43,767 --> 00:21:47,237
We cannot hold the gate.
Repeat, Stargate is not secure.

231
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:52,439
Soon we will be surrounded.
If we fight, many more will die.

232
00:21:52,527 --> 00:21:54,722
What do you wanna do?

233
00:21:55,807 --> 00:21:57,798
Surrender.

234
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:05,765
There is a chance
Adal and his rebel Jaffa can free us later.

235
00:22:16,447 --> 00:22:19,007
Dr Jackson? Dr Lee?

236
00:22:21,247 --> 00:22:25,923
Yeah, we're here.
We found a chamber. Gonna be a while.

237
00:22:26,007 --> 00:22:28,601
Ah, take your time, señor.

238
00:22:30,927 --> 00:22:33,122
We're paying him by the hour.

239
00:22:34,127 --> 00:22:38,598
I don't understand. How are we supposed
to find this thing if there is no writing?

240
00:22:38,687 --> 00:22:41,406
All water flows towards it.

241
00:22:41,487 --> 00:22:43,443
So?

242
00:22:43,527 --> 00:22:45,518
Give me your canteen.

243
00:22:47,887 --> 00:22:49,878
Here, hold this.

244
00:22:58,087 --> 00:23:00,681
What good's that gonna do?

245
00:23:24,927 --> 00:23:27,395
There's something under here.

246
00:23:27,487 --> 00:23:29,079
You're good.

247
00:23:42,727 --> 00:23:46,720
- How's he doing?
- Stable, but we've gotta get him out soon.

248
00:23:46,807 --> 00:23:49,241
I'm fine.

249
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:51,443
Jaffa!

250
00:23:57,847 --> 00:23:59,838
I'll handle this.

251
00:24:01,047 --> 00:24:03,038
Greetings!

252
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:10,399
Well, uh, I know how this looks,

253
00:24:10,487 --> 00:24:16,357
so I think it's important we clear up
any misunderstanding right away.

254
00:24:16,447 --> 00:24:18,881
We did not come to kill you.

255
00:24:21,847 --> 00:24:23,644
Honest.

256
00:24:23,727 --> 00:24:25,718
Am I right?

257
00:24:29,447 --> 00:24:36,603
The fact is, and this is the fun part,
we actually came to save your ass... es.

258
00:24:36,687 --> 00:24:38,723
All your asses.

259
00:24:38,807 --> 00:24:40,604
Do you see the irony?

260
00:24:44,927 --> 00:24:46,724
All right,

261
00:24:46,807 --> 00:24:51,164
there's this guy out there,
big guy, big guy in a black suit,

262
00:24:51,247 --> 00:24:53,238
none too fond of you Goa'ulds.

263
00:24:56,687 --> 00:24:59,724
Well, anyway,
he's the one we're after, not you.

264
00:24:59,807 --> 00:25:04,961
So if you wanna let us go, we'll be on
our way to save the world another day.

265
00:25:05,047 --> 00:25:06,639
You're not buying this.

266
00:25:06,727 --> 00:25:08,524
Jaffa!

267
00:25:09,727 --> 00:25:11,718
Kree!

268
00:25:15,687 --> 00:25:17,882
Well, that went well.

269
00:25:20,647 --> 00:25:23,207
That went well.

270
00:25:51,527 --> 00:25:55,042
- Well, at least it has writing on it.
- Yeah.

271
00:25:56,487 --> 00:25:58,284
What's it say?

272
00:25:58,367 --> 00:26:00,562
I have no idea.

273
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:02,806
Oh.

274
00:26:02,887 --> 00:26:05,003
Careful!

275
00:26:05,087 --> 00:26:09,285
It's the root technology of a sarcophagus,
which causes madness and addiction.

276
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:15,317
This is, supposedly, something far more
powerful, so activating it could be bad.

277
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,203
OK.

278
00:26:16,287 --> 00:26:20,075
Let's try picking it up
without touching it too much.

279
00:26:41,287 --> 00:26:43,642
Running would be a good idea about now.

280
00:26:51,007 --> 00:26:53,396
Dr Jackson, can you hear me?

281
00:26:59,727 --> 00:27:02,764
Your friend's condition worsens.

282
00:27:02,847 --> 00:27:05,884
Yeah, well, your friends
can show up anytime now.

283
00:27:05,967 --> 00:27:09,277
We must consider that they may not.

284
00:27:10,527 --> 00:27:12,643
Really?

285
00:27:12,727 --> 00:27:14,718
At least we are alive.

286
00:27:14,807 --> 00:27:18,243
Yes, if you call this living.

287
00:27:18,327 --> 00:27:24,277
You're worried that the super-soldier will
kill Ramius and slaughter the rest of us.

288
00:27:24,367 --> 00:27:27,165
- "Super-soldier"?
- No?

289
00:27:27,247 --> 00:27:29,681
It has a ring.

290
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:32,645
Most likely,
the warrior was only after Ramius.

291
00:27:32,727 --> 00:27:37,005
When we attacked, its only concern was
escape so that its mission was completed.

292
00:27:37,087 --> 00:27:40,318
So we just sit around
while Ramius gets whacked?

293
00:27:40,407 --> 00:27:42,398
Then what?

294
00:27:49,607 --> 00:27:51,404
Hey.

295
00:27:53,887 --> 00:27:56,560
A little conversation gonna kill ya?

296
00:27:58,487 --> 00:28:01,479
Look, I know you're all about loyalty.

297
00:28:01,567 --> 00:28:03,956
So am I. In fact, many's the time...

298
00:28:04,047 --> 00:28:06,242
- Silence!
- Teal'c?

299
00:28:13,207 --> 00:28:19,203
Hear me, Jaffa. Your master is a false god
and will surely be defeated.

300
00:28:19,287 --> 00:28:22,438
However, you still have
a chance to be free.

301
00:28:22,527 --> 00:28:26,918
Your words mean nothing to me.
I know who you are.

302
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:30,204
The Shol'va, Teal'c. And Bra'tac.

303
00:28:30,287 --> 00:28:31,879
O'Neill of the Tauri.

304
00:28:31,967 --> 00:28:35,516
Assassins who believe
they could slay my master.

305
00:28:40,687 --> 00:28:44,600
Well, if we're assassins, who's that?

306
00:28:44,687 --> 00:28:46,086
Hm?

307
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:51,281
Dr Jackson, Dr Lee, can you hear me?

308
00:28:52,127 --> 00:28:53,924
Can you hear me?!

309
00:29:26,047 --> 00:29:28,607
Are you OK?
I thought you were dead for sure.

310
00:29:28,687 --> 00:29:30,757
We triggered some sort of trap.

311
00:29:30,847 --> 00:29:33,486
I figured out why those passageways
were so narrow.

312
00:29:33,567 --> 00:29:37,446
- To prevent people from escaping alive.
- You're good.

313
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:39,518
What have you found?

314
00:29:42,807 --> 00:29:45,401
I'm not going to rob you, señor.

315
00:29:53,647 --> 00:29:55,638
Hostia.

316
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,126
Madre de Dios.

317
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:13,560
Consider this:
Does it sound like it's going well?

318
00:30:13,647 --> 00:30:16,445
Your master will die,
as will you, if you do not free us.

319
00:30:16,527 --> 00:30:21,362
You lie. My master is a god.
He is invincible.

320
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,324
You're next, you know.

321
00:30:32,127 --> 00:30:34,925
Ramius will force you to die for him
while he escapes.

322
00:30:35,007 --> 00:30:38,443
- My god will fight for his people.
- You are wrong, my friend.

323
00:30:38,527 --> 00:30:42,918
Your god is somewhere cowering in fear
like a child. I have seen it before.

324
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:48,286
He will not hesitate to sacrifice
all your lives to save his own.

325
00:30:51,967 --> 00:30:53,286
Hey!

326
00:30:53,367 --> 00:30:55,927
What about us?

327
00:30:56,007 --> 00:30:58,805
Shouldn't it be getting easier
to convince these guys?

328
00:30:58,887 --> 00:31:00,878
Sir?

329
00:31:05,887 --> 00:31:10,403
- Hang in there, Reynolds.
- As long as it takes.

330
00:31:15,847 --> 00:31:19,886
Ramius has fallen.
Go now, before it comes for you.

331
00:31:19,967 --> 00:31:22,356
Go, go, go! Come on, guys.

332
00:31:25,487 --> 00:31:28,559
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.

333
00:31:32,327 --> 00:31:34,318
Come on.

334
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:43,718
If this is a turf thing
we're not aware of, we're sorry.

335
00:31:43,807 --> 00:31:46,037
Oh, no, señor. Please, don't speak.

336
00:31:46,127 --> 00:31:50,279
I'm just saying that whoever
you guys think we are, we're not.

337
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:52,642
Who do I think you are?

338
00:31:52,727 --> 00:31:54,319
I don't know.

339
00:31:54,407 --> 00:31:57,638
We're scientists. Archaeologists, in fact.

340
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:04,446
I'm just saying if this is a kidnapping, you
should know we're not worth anything.

341
00:32:04,527 --> 00:32:08,440
Trust me, gringo. Everyone's
worth something to somebody.

342
00:32:10,047 --> 00:32:13,278
I tripped. I'm sorry.
Gee, I can't see anything.

343
00:32:15,327 --> 00:32:17,124
Chalo!

344
00:32:20,207 --> 00:32:22,004
Argh!

345
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:28,877
- What just happened?
- Your guide, he tried to run.

346
00:32:28,967 --> 00:32:30,958
What can you do?

347
00:32:33,127 --> 00:32:37,040
Maybe now we'll all stay on the path.
Eh, muchachos?

348
00:32:37,127 --> 00:32:38,526
After you.

349
00:32:38,607 --> 00:32:40,677
Vámonos/

350
00:32:59,567 --> 00:33:00,522
Ouch!

351
00:33:00,607 --> 00:33:04,486
It would appear Ramius was attempting
to get to one of his ships.

352
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:08,082
Sir, I think we still have a chance
to capture the warrior.

353
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:10,158
How?

354
00:33:26,207 --> 00:33:28,675
- Transport cycle complete.
- Get him?

355
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:31,964
- Got him.
- Good.

356
00:33:32,047 --> 00:33:33,446
Indeed.

357
00:33:40,487 --> 00:33:43,923
Chino! José! Ven para acá.

358
00:33:44,007 --> 00:33:45,645
Far enough!

359
00:33:45,727 --> 00:33:47,319
Agárralo.

360
00:33:48,207 --> 00:33:50,198
Ilévenselo.

361
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:07,641
I don't know what you expect but no one'll
pay anything for us. We're worth nothing.

362
00:34:07,727 --> 00:34:12,403
That is unfortunate for you
because if no one pays, you both die.

363
00:34:24,127 --> 00:34:26,402
- It's still unconscious?
- Not surprising,

364
00:34:26,487 --> 00:34:30,526
considering we voided the cargo bay
of life support once we got it on the ship.

365
00:34:30,607 --> 00:34:34,236
- It took ten minutes to pass out.
- I'm surprised it's even alive.

366
00:34:34,327 --> 00:34:37,717
It put up a hell of a fight, sir.

367
00:34:38,607 --> 00:34:40,199
Hammond.

368
00:34:41,047 --> 00:34:43,038
Very well.

369
00:34:45,727 --> 00:34:47,365
Your prisoner is awake.

370
00:35:02,527 --> 00:35:04,995
Who do you serve? Hm?

371
00:35:05,607 --> 00:35:07,484
Speak!

372
00:35:07,567 --> 00:35:10,764
I serve Anubis.

373
00:35:23,727 --> 00:35:26,116
How were you created?

374
00:35:38,607 --> 00:35:42,202
I think it's safe to assume
they won't get any more out of him.

375
00:35:42,287 --> 00:35:44,084
Found anything else?

376
00:35:44,167 --> 00:35:47,284
Initial scans indicate
below-normal brain-wave patterns

377
00:35:47,367 --> 00:35:50,006
emanating from both
the symbiote and the host.

378
00:35:50,087 --> 00:35:53,397
He has the strength and healing powers
of a normal Goa'uld,

379
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:56,081
but none of the normal personality traits.

380
00:35:56,167 --> 00:35:59,876
The Goa'uld use sophisticated
brainwashing techniques.

381
00:35:59,967 --> 00:36:04,006
I'm open to suggestions. How can we
find out what it knows, if anything?

382
00:36:04,087 --> 00:36:08,000
There is one possibility. We may
be able to use a memory-recall device

383
00:36:08,087 --> 00:36:12,603
to access any conscious images
in its mind as it thinks them.

384
00:36:13,967 --> 00:36:16,356
Do it.

385
00:36:26,207 --> 00:36:28,277
Sir?

386
00:36:28,367 --> 00:36:30,358
- Any word from Daniel?
- No.

387
00:36:30,447 --> 00:36:34,326
He is now six hours overdue
per his regular contact schedule.

388
00:36:34,407 --> 00:36:36,443
That's late, even for Daniel.

389
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:39,917
The Honduran government
is looking into it.

390
00:36:40,007 --> 00:36:45,957
They've sent some people to their last
reported location, but found nothing.

391
00:36:46,967 --> 00:36:50,243
If his brain waves
are compatible with the device,

392
00:36:50,327 --> 00:36:54,957
we should be able to see
whatever he's thinking holographically.

393
00:37:11,087 --> 00:37:13,681
What is your planet of origin?

394
00:37:25,967 --> 00:37:28,003
That's the sky above his planet.

395
00:37:28,087 --> 00:37:31,875
I don't recognise these star
configurations. It could be anywhere.

396
00:37:31,967 --> 00:37:38,998
We have technology that should be able
to pinpoint this location in the galaxy.

397
00:37:39,087 --> 00:37:41,681
He just gave us his home world.

398
00:37:51,847 --> 00:37:53,838
¿Listos?

399
00:38:07,607 --> 00:38:10,883
I know it's not much,
but we do what we can.

400
00:38:24,647 --> 00:38:26,638
So...

401
00:38:27,727 --> 00:38:30,446
Here's my proposal for you.

402
00:38:30,527 --> 00:38:32,961
I will ask questions, you give me answers.

403
00:38:33,047 --> 00:38:39,725
I believe you, you get more water,
food, maybe even a blanket at night.

404
00:38:39,807 --> 00:38:41,604
OK?

405
00:38:42,607 --> 00:38:44,404
OK.

406
00:38:45,207 --> 00:38:47,562
Who do you work for?

407
00:38:47,647 --> 00:38:52,596
- I told you. We're archaeologists...
- Maybe I was not so clear.

408
00:38:52,687 --> 00:38:57,886
If I don't believe you,
things get worse for you. Much worse.

409
00:38:57,967 --> 00:39:00,117
You kill us, you get nothing.

410
00:39:02,927 --> 00:39:07,125
Maybe I kill one of you
to get your government's attention.

411
00:39:09,127 --> 00:39:11,118
Who lives?

412
00:39:11,207 --> 00:39:13,323
Who dies?

413
00:39:13,407 --> 00:39:14,806
That's up to you.

414
00:39:15,007 --> 00:39:17,805
OK, you listen to me.

415
00:39:20,287 --> 00:39:22,596
What you're doing now is a big mistake.

416
00:39:22,687 --> 00:39:25,406
People, very powerful people,
are gonna come for us

417
00:39:25,487 --> 00:39:31,835
and, well, let's just say by letting us go
now, you'll save yourself a lot of trouble.

418
00:39:36,687 --> 00:39:38,086
OK.

419
00:39:42,647 --> 00:39:44,638
We do it the hard way.

420
00:39:47,287 --> 00:39:49,323
Understand this:

421
00:39:49,407 --> 00:39:53,685
I will not hesitate to kill you both, make
an example of you for your government,

422
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:57,442
so the next time
they will take us seriously.

423
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:04,524
You should know,
many prisoners talk as you do:

424
00:40:04,607 --> 00:40:07,041
"My friends will come and save me."

425
00:40:07,647 --> 00:40:09,763
It gives them hope.

426
00:40:32,327 --> 00:40:34,124
The Tok'ra call it Tartarus -

427
00:40:34,207 --> 00:40:37,756
a seemingly unoccupied planet
in Goa'uld-controlled space.

428
00:40:37,847 --> 00:40:42,967
The Tok'ra are currently trying to assess
any defences that might be there.

429
00:40:43,047 --> 00:40:44,639
Sir?

430
00:40:45,607 --> 00:40:48,075
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

431
00:40:48,167 --> 00:40:52,240
I just received a communiqué
from the State Department in Washington.

432
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:58,197
It appears that Daniel Jackson
and Dr Lee have been kidnapped.

433
00:40:58,287 --> 00:41:00,881
They may have crossed
the border into Nicaragua.

434
00:41:00,967 --> 00:41:05,643
However, as of this moment,
we have no idea where they are.

435
