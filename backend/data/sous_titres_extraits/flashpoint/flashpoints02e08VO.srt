1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:05,300
Team 1,hot call at the Michelangelo
Foodsat Brimley and Matheson.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,380
Armed robbery,multiple hostages.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,060
There's some misunderstanding.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,430
He's only 17.

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,010
You have got to get him out of there.

6
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,730
- Wordy,how you doing?
- I'm heading to the drops. Steer me in.

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,600
With haste,gentlemen,with haste.

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,500
Where do I start?

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,700
He's had the year from hell.

10
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,920
- Get out of my face.
- It's over.

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,290
Sierra 1 in position.

12
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,760
Hold fire till my command.

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,170
- I thought I could trust you.
- Put the gun down.

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,140
- Standing by for explosive entry.
- Copy that.

15
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,050
- Think I won't do it?
- I know you won't do it.

16
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,810
- Sierra 1...
- I've got the solution.

17
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,990
- Donnie,give it to me. It's over!
- No!

18
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,820
Scorpio.

19
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,780
So that's it? That's
the plan: Lethbridge?

20
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,970
5 hours eailier

21
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,710
{a6}Jack said he can get me a job.

22
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,320
{a6}What about the restaurant?

23
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,170
Your dream,our dream.

24
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,380
It'll pick up again,David.

25
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,330
By $30,000?

26
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,680
Just give it time.

27
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,990
See this letter,Liz?

28
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,060
Do you see where it says
"Notice of eviction"?

29
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,470
Don't talk to me like I'm a child.

30
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,880
Well,stop acting like one.

31
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,110
Face facts!

32
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,870
The restaurant's a failure.

33
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,680
So... whose fault is that?

34
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,660
Don't you dare lay this at my feet.

35
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,640
Well,I'm not the one dragging our
family halfway across the country.

36
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,120
Hey,Jules.

37
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,150
Hey.

38
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,420
- What are you doing here?
- That's a nice way to say hi.

39
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,700
I'm sorry. I didn't expect to see you.

40
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,540
Glad you came by.

41
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,330
Actually,I came to talk to the boss.

42
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,490
Which... I should go.

43
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,620
Hey,Jules,what's wrong?

44
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,620
Nothing's wrong.

45
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,860
You've been avoiding me all week.

46
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,420
I have not been avoiding you all week.

47
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,760
Yeah,you have,Jules.

48
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,760
Sam,okay,I'm not going to do this here.

49
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,370
Do what?

50
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,080
Hey,do what?

51
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:50,160
- When I return to the SRU...
- Jules,we talked about this.

52
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,660
We did? Me bringing it up
and you changing the subject.

53
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,080
That's not talking about it,Sam.

54
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,740
Well,what's the point?

55
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,640
The point is,when I return to the SRU,

56
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,790
we have to talk about
what happens then,okay?

57
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,270
Now you're on shift,so
let's talk tonight.

58
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,650
Okay,I'll meet you at your place.

59
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,240
Okay. We'll get a coffee or something.

60
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,930
Okay,coffee.

61
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,690
I can't stand being in
this house anymore,man.

62
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,120
I got to get out.

63
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,320
Want to catch a movie?

64
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,750
Nah,I'm not into it.

65
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,090
Go to the mall. Sit
outside Bikini Cabin.

66
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,440
Come on,Donnie. What are you,like 12?

67
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,680
Man,like you weren't into it

68
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,550
when Tessa Price was there with
the new belly button piercing?

69
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,030
Oh,my God.

70
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,970
- Meet me at the shop in ten.
- All right.

71
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,670
Hey,bud,Mom is out,so I
thought that we'd have a talk.

72
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,580
About moving 3,400 clicks away?

73
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,300
I checked.

74
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,050
I'm sorry you found out
the way that you did.

75
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,270
Well,what about school?

76
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,440
And my friends?

77
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,140
Aren't we just talking about Donnie?

78
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,420
Why are you always ragging on him?

79
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,360
Because it seems like your whole
world revolves around this kid.

80
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,940
I-I... I really don't
think it's healthy.

81
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,900
How about you just try expanding
your horizons a little bit?

82
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,190
Hey,where are you going?

83
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,120
My horizons need expanding.

84
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,080
So had to think fast,right?

85
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,450
Like one of those times when you
got to do what you got to do,right?

86
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,470
So the subject comes
running up screaming.

87
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,580
I kick the door down,right?

88
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,920
Spike didn't kick the door in.

89
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,650
I did.

90
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,800
And the subject wasn't screaming.

91
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,550
Guys,you mind? I'm
telling a story here,okay?

92
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,300
So the subject comes out
with this blade,Donna.

93
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,830
And it's like this big.

94
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,010
Wow,a sword.

95
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,740
Okay,okay,maybe more like that.

96
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,750
- A machete.
- Yeah,sure,it was a machete.

97
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,250
Donna... it was this big.

98
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,640
Wh are you talking about this big?

99
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,880
- I'm just saying it was...
- What is that supposed to be?

100
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,620
That's not even a letter opener.

101
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,050
It doesn't matter about the size,Spike.

102
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,900
What are you doing that? You know
you shouldn't do that to a guy ever.

103
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,780
Sam,you're late for workout.

104
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,220
Sorry,sir.

105
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,300
- No.
- What do you mean no?

106
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,030
I mean,no,you can't go.

107
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,480
Like I have a choice?

108
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,320
Look,my parents are broke or something.

109
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,180
They're behind on rent.

110
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,870
They're kicking us out.

111
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,610
Then all we've got to
do is find the money.

112
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,320
Yeah,and how are we going to do that?

113
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,180
I don't know.

114
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,530
My dad's got some old vinyl.

115
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,900
Maybe we could sell
it online or something.

116
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,010
Donnie,it's like 30 grand.

117
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,350
There's no way.

118
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,420
Dude,you can't go.

119
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,050
You're the only non-jerk I know.

120
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,120
Please,I'm already pissed off.

121
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,300
Don't make it worse.

122
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,920
You should be.

123
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,710
We grew up here.

124
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,020
This is our store. That's our mall.

125
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,530
This is our life.

126
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,370
They're going to throw it all away?

127
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,730
Let's go. I need to chill.

128
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,760
How you doing?

129
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,000
I asked you a
question,Sam. How you doing?

130
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,190
Fine. I'm fine.

131
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,420
- You look like crap.
- Thanks.

132
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,140
- But you're fine?
- That's what I said.

133
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,250
That's what you said.

134
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,150
Oh,you're mirroring me,Ed?

135
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,830
'Cause I'm your
teammate,not your subject.

136
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,680
I know that,but if something's wrong,

137
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,070
it's going to affect your
performance; I need to know.

138
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,990
I'm fine. Really.

139
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,930
Hold up.

140
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,160
Bro,what are you doing?

141
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,830
Why are we stopping here?

142
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,860
I want some cookies.

143
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,920
You serious? They have them
at the convenience store.

144
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,540
Yeah,well,I like the
ones they have here.

145
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,280
Do you know how much they
charge? They're like ten bucks.

146
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,590
Yeah,dude,I know.

147
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,330
I used to work here. That's
how I got hooked on 'em.

148
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,790
Why'd they fire you anyway?

149
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,960
'Cause they're jerks.

150
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,800
I was totally awesome at that
job,man,totally dedicated.

151
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,420
The cookies are that way.

152
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,530
No,no,they're up there now.

153
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,850
What?

154
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,950
I got so much work in the office.

155
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,780
I'm never going home.

156
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,140
That the guy that fired you?

157
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,280
No. He's Ashton,the night manager.

158
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,550
You know,after my dedicated
service to this establishment,

159
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,940
I think I deserve a parting gift.

160
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,710
Can you not do this right now?

161
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,980
Nylons?

162
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,440
For my mom.

163
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,780
Donnie... Let's hit the head.

164
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,900
There's one in the
back-- employees only.

165
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,640
Just drop the stuff so we can go.

166
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,550
Bathroom first. Come on.

167
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,980
What?!

168
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,340
We're not supposed to be here.

169
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,480
Oh,easy,Grandma.

170
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,720
It's almost closing time.

171
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,280
No one's gonna be back here.

172
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,270
In five minutes,the head teller's
gonna give the deposit bags to Ashton.

173
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,470
No.

174
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,530
No,I do not want to hear this.

175
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,670
Just listen.

176
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,150
Ashton's going to bring
the deposit bags down

177
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,000
to the safe to be picked up
later tonight by security.

178
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,180
What are you saying?

179
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,520
I'm saying we stop him.

180
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,000
Jump out,grab the money.

181
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,870
We run out that service door. It's easy.

182
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,360
****missing***

183
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,080
Your dad needs money,right?

184
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,640
For rent?

185
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,760
Dude,come on!

186
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,010
Look,man.

187
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,160
We're brothers,okay?

188
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,370
And brothers are always
there for each other.

189
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,850
Five minutes and everything
gets taken care of.

190
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,920
Five minutes and you
get everything you need.

191
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,090
Some dude did the exact
same thing a year ago.

192
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,180
He made off with like 70K.

193
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,660
Okay,whatever.

194
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,980
It's still wrong.

195
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,900
The store's insured. They don't care.

196
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,270
D,stop.

197
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,580
Stop and think a second.

198
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,640
I have.

199
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,360
And you can either step up and help,

200
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,250
or you can turn your back
and let me go out there alone.

201
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,600
Dude,you know I'm not going
to let you do that by yourself.

202
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,000
So you're with me?

203
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,170
You're with me.

204
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,180
Give me the money!

205
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,510
Come on!  Come on!

206
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:36,160
Lose the stocking. Lose the stocking!

207
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,960
Drop the bag. Drop it. Drop it!

208
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,960
Come on! Come on!

209
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,370
Help me!

210
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,740
Donnie!

211
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,560
Get him off!

212
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,340
What the... what the hell?!

213
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,050
What the hell did you do?!

214
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,120
You wanted me to help you.

215
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,800
Go. We're headed out the front door.

216
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,270
We're just two customers
walking out the front door.

217
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,040
Nearly there.

218
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,650
Like I said,there was two of them.

219
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,950
A big guy in a black jacket.

220
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,250
The other guy had a red coat.

221
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,930
They were armed... That's them.

222
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,730
We're done,man.

223
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,460
It's over.

224
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,480
It ain't over,bro.

225
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,060
Not even close.

229
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:25,910
Team 1,hot call at the Michelangelo
Foods at Brimley and Matheson.

230
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,550
Armed robbery,multiple htages.

231
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,740
Sam and Donna,recon the
building,all ways in and out.

232
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,120
Copy that.

233
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,930
Okay,here's what we know.

234
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,330
Old-school stickup,two masked
guys come in before closing,

235
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,280
hold up the manager with a knife.

236
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,910
And moved away from the window. No shot.

237
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,220
Spike,let's make sure
everyone's healthy in there.

238
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,020
I can get into the security
system,patch it into the truck.

239
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,210
- Eyes in ten minutes.
- You got five.

240
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,710
- Lew,you're my second.
- Copy that.

241
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:05,610
Sarge,subjects bumped into
armed security as they fled.

242
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,570
One of the guards
chased 'em back inside.

243
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,420
After that,we don't know
what happened to them.

244
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,490
Okay,well,let's hope they didn't
get their hands on his gun.

245
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,480
See if we can ID him,Wordy.

246
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,760
Copy.

247
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,890
Eddy,tac options?

248
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,190
We got high exposed
ceilings,lots of vantage.

249
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:24,160
I say we stealth in,set up a
sniper perch,watch and wait.

250
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,970
All right,well,you know
what you need to do.

251
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,190
Copy that.

252
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,160
Look... this is really
making me nervous.

253
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,690
Will you put it away?

254
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,450
Kinda using it right now.

255
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,550
Dude,robbery is one thing,but
now there's a gun,okay?

256
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,570
- There are hostages.
- I know.

257
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:47,930
It's cool,huh?

258
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,030
Cool?

259
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,930
He used to work here.

260
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:51,930
No,I didn't.

261
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,000
Yeah,you did.

262
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,590
You're the guy they caught
napping in the storeroom.

263
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,470
- What's your name again? Richie?
- No,it wasn't me.

264
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,680
Yeah,whatever.

265
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,130
- Don't "whatever" me.
- Yeah,man,whatever.

266
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,760
I'm not scared of you.

267
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,830
You're not gonna use that gun.

268
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,160
He's not gonna use the gun.

269
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,480
I'd prefer to give him
the benefit of the doubt.

270
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:13,580
This is Sergeant Gregory Parker with
the Police Strategic Response Unit.

271
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,370
I will be calling the store phone,

272
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,370
so please pick it up so
we can talk this over.

273
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,530
Okay,dude,when he
calls,we'll say we're sorry.

274
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,020
Let's forget about it and go home.

275
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,990
He sounded nice.

276
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,780
Maybe,maybe he could help.

277
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,920
Maybe,maybe he'll lessen the charges.

278
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,650
It's not like we did anything that bad.

279
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,090
'Cept for armed robbery.

280
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,820
Not like that's a felony.

281
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,280
Is this what it's gonna
take for you to shut up?

282
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,770
- Okay.
- What happened there,tough guy?

283
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,170
What happened? Something scare you?

284
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,280
- Not so chatty now,are you?
- D,stop!

285
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,650
Dude,this is messed up.

286
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,740
Let's just walk away.

287
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,000
Oh,yeah,yeah,walk right into jail.

288
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,280
And you know what
happens in jail,don't you?

289
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,850
To guys like you and me,hmm?

290
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,230
Think about it.

291
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,970
Tape their wrists.

292
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,870
Is there anything you can give
that'll help ID these guys?

293
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,180
Height,weight,tattoos,scars,anything?

294
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,860
Oh,man,it was all a big blur.

295
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,950
One was black; one was white.

296
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:22,020
One of 'em was wearing one of
those glow-in-the-dark ankle bands.

297
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,450
- Like cyclists wear?
- Yeah.

298
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,100
9:48 p.m.: SRU on scene.

299
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,510
Armed robbery,Michelangelo's.

300
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,850
Establishing command post.

301
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,240
Spike,eyes.

302
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,710
Moments away,boss. Moments away.

303
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,470
That's the cops.

304
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,550
Take over.

305
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,750
Hey,this is Sergeant Greg Parker.

306
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,490
Who am I speaking to?

307
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:01,910
This is... this is D-Roc.

308
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,050
D-Roc,is that a nickname,last name?

309
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,200
I had a buddy back home.

310
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,050
We used to call him
"D." His name was Daryl.

311
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,320
Your name Daryl?

312
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,350
Look,I know how you guys operate,okay?

313
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,900
Don't try to be my buddy.

314
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,920
Don't play me.

315
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,280
I'm not here to play games,D-Roc.

316
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,980
I'm here to help you.

317
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,250
That went well.

318
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,560
Spike,eyes?

319
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,130
Let there be light.

320
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,920
Got a customer in scrubs. Maybe a nurse?

321
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,810
Those two look like
employees. Possibly a manager.

322
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:39,120
- That's D-Roc.
Subject one. - Yeah?

323
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,230
Hey,D-Roc,I need to know who
else is in there with you.

324
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,320
Can you tell me?

325
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,670
We got three hostages.

326
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,580
Not including the security guard?

327
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,260
Yeah. Not including him.

328
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,710
- And he's unharmed?
- He's fine.

329
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,660
He's not hurt?

330
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,900
I told you he's fine. He's in the back.

331
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,120
Don't worry about him.

332
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,700
Okay,D-Roc,your partner.

333
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,850
Mind if I ask what his name is?

334
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,200
Backslash.

335
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,900
Backslash.

336
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,650
All right,I told you
what you wanted to know.

337
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,850
Now it's my turn.

338
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,590
- Let's talk demands.
- All right.

339
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,200
- We need to get out of here.
- Okay. Where?

340
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,760
- Where we wanna go?
- Home.

341
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,590
Come on. Gimme something!

342
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,770
Tell you where we're going later.

343
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,980
Right now,you just get us
something to take us there.

344
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,380
Okay,where?

345
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,130
He doesn't know what he wants.

346
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,470
He's covering insecurity
with arrogance right now.

347
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,900
- He's scared.
- But determined.

348
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,030
Not a happy combo.

349
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,160
Those aliases come up in the database?

350
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,900
D-Roc and Backslash come back clean.

351
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,250
Maybe it's a gang initiation.

352
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,580
Nah,Backslash,that's not
street. That's a computer thing.

353
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,840
Okay,could be a handle.

354
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,030
Guys,Facebook,MySpace,online forums.

355
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,120
Copy.

356
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,520
I got a couple of bikes here.

357
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,050
Wordy,check the undersides
for serial numbers.

358
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,120
Uh,there's nothing on the first one.

359
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,210
Wait,I got one.

360
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,810
487 623

361
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:59,840
Okay,Wiiesubject's bike
has a serial number: 487623.

362
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,670
Accessing Metro Police database.

363
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,630
Got it. Adam Jackson.

364
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,400
32 Fern Crescent,Markham.

365
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,490
- Age?
- He's 17.

366
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,860
Wonderful Winnie.

367
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,670
Have uniforms dispatch to
that address immediately.

368
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,070
You got it.

369
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,780
This is Winnie Camden with the SRU.

370
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,980
I need uniforms at
3230 Fern Crescent ASAP.

371
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,130
- Kids.
- Perfect.

372
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:26,570
- Guys,no one wants a kid in their crosshairs.
- Copy that.

373
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,580
Guys,I got a way in.

374
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,290
The subjects are barricaded in here

375
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,220
which gives them good sightlines
on the front and side entrances.

376
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,600
- So we come in from the rear?
- Yeah.

377
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,880
We check out the loading dock.

378
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,090
If we can't go through, there's
a trapdoor in the storage rm

379
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,240
that will get us to the machine room.

380
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,020
So we shimmy up,pry open the
trapdoor to the machine room.

381
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,050
Then we're on the roof.

382
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,120
- Exactly.
- Nice.

383
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,870
There's a skylight right
here,which give us good vantage.

384
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,250
Cut a hole,set up a perch.

385
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,670
I line up the Sierra shot.

386
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,930
No,I got it.

387
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,510
Is there any reason why you
don't want me to take it?

388
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,560
Do I need one? It's my team,my call.

389
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,920
Donna,contain the front. Let's go.

390
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,760
Okay,guys,it looks like
the hostages are in the back

391
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,060
right corner of the
store in the deli section.

392
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,440
We're gonna need options if
we're gonna avoid a Sierra shot.

393
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,400
Boss,Adam's mom's here.

394
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,000
Mrs. Jackson,I'm Sergeant Parker.

395
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,360
How's Adam? Is he all right?

396
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,440
He's unharmed,ma'am,but
he's in a lot of trouble.

397
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,560
He's in there with the other
kid. They robbed the store.

398
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,170
It went south. And they took hostages.

399
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,430
No,no,no,that's crazy.

400
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,050
There is some misunderstanding.

401
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,590
He is only 17.

402
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,560
You have got to get him out of there.

403
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,500
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes.

404
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,680
Does the name D-Roc
mean anything to you?

405
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,210
Donnie,Donnie Lakeman.

406
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,300
That's his best friend.

407
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,350
Do you have an address?

408
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,790
Somewhere on,on,Kuniff Crescent.

409
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,110
- Thank you. Lewis,you copy?
- Got it.

410
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,980
Okay. Do you know if
Donnie's been diagnosed

411
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,860
with any disorders or conditions?

412
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,360
I don't know. It wouldn't surprise me.

413
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:03,010
That's one good thing about us
moving: getting Adam away from Donnie.

414
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,610
I have to call my husband.

415
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,170
You're moving?

416
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,390
- Yes.
- Thank you.

417
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,760
Please don't do this.

418
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,530
Just be quiet.

419
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,030
You should... you should get the phone.

420
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,840
Don't tell me. I know.

421
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,890
I'm trying to figure this out.

422
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,610
Look down.

423
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,220
Please?

424
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:36,000
- You're pregnant?
- 20 weeks.

425
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,070
It's a boy.

426
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,430
I didn't know. I didn't know.

427
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:43,000
It's okay,but... but now you do,right?

428
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,040
So you can let me go.

429
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,990
Look,you didn't sign up for this.

430
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,820
Please help me.

431
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,910
- Bro,I've been thinking.
- Me,too.

432
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:54,280
- All right,you see that lady over there?
- We need to get a chopper.

433
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,690
We get a chopper,we can get out of here.

434
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:56,880
Donnie... Think it through!

435
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,870
If we get a chopper,they can't chase us!

436
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,910
You're not thinking straight.

437
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,080
I'm the one who's trying
to get us out of here.

438
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,000
- You're not thinking straight.
- The last thing we need is...

439
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,910
Look out behind you! He's got a knife!

440
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,870
Subject has shot the
guard. The guard is down!

441
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,290
Shot fired! Shot fired!

442
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,330
What did you do?!

443
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,780
What did you do?!

444
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,110
10:05 p.m. Shot fired. Guard hit.

445
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,160
Why did you shoot him?

446
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,830
He was going to kill you.

447
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,850
You saw the way he came at you.

448
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,180
It was him or you.

449
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,440
I just wanted to help my dad.

450
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,830
This is bad,Donnie. D-Roc!

451
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,570
D-Roc.
 D-Roc!

452
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:38,570
Use the aliases.

453
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,560
There's a man bleeding
here that you shot!

454
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,570
We're going to jail!

455
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,780
We've got a man down. Medics
stand by. Gunshot wound.

456
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,160
Eddie,we got to step this up.

457
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,970
Copy. Entering loading dock.

458
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,320
Stupid,stupid,stupid.

459
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,520
D,stop.

460
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,470
Stupid,stupid,stupid,stupid!

461
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,400
Stop. Chill,man. Come on.

462
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,770
All right. Chill? How about this?

463
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,720
Or how about this?

464
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,050
Pick up the phone. Pick up
the phone. Pick up the phone.

465
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,620
I'm so sorry.

466
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,680
He didn't mean... He
didn't mean to shoot.

467
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,590
He didn't mean to shoot...
He didn't mean to shoot!

468
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,160
Give me the phone!

469
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,550
They'll hear us if we blast that.

470
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,530
All right,Wordy,there
it is. Right there.

471
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,130
- All right,you stay here and contain.
- All right.

472
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,700
Give it to me!

473
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,910
Okay,okay.

474
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,760
- Listen to me.
- I'm listening.

475
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,380
You can see in here,right?

476
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,690
I know you can see.
You saw what happened.

477
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,780
He came at my friend with a knife.

478
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,320
What would you do,huh?

479
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,530
Someone came at your
best friend with a knife?

480
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,970
No,you were trying to protect
your friend. I hear you,D-Roc.

481
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,440
That's right. You got that right.

482
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,640
That's what you do.

483
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,410
And that's why I'm
here,trying to talk to you.

484
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:02,470
Trying to keep you and Adam safe. Okay?

485
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,630
Now,how's that guard doing?

486
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,390
I need you to help the guard.

487
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,830
What? No. No,no,no,no,no. I can't.

488
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:26,660
Please. Because we can't
go in for murder. All right?

489
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,070
Robbery is one thing,but
if the guy dies...

490
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,130
What am I supposed to do?

491
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,450
- You're a nurse.
- I'm a dental hygienist.

492
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,350
Just do what you can,okay?

493
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,570
Just do what you can,please.

494
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,330
He reay needs your help.

495
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,090
I don't care if it's
complicated,smart g...

496
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:44,560
Give me some washcloths.Plastic
wrap,whatever.

497
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,400
Okay.

498
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,230
Hey,where are you going?

499
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,960
I don't have time to explain,okay?

500
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,550
She's helping the
guard and we need stuff.

501
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,110
He knows your name.

502
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,660
He knows your name,dude.

503
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,980
That's okay. It's okay.

504
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,380
Just be ready to leave,okay?

505
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,440
I told him we wanted a chopper.

506
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,180
What is wrong with you?

507
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,750
The only way we're getting out of here

508
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,900
is with our hands in the air or
with our backs on a stretcher.

509
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,730
- You don't know that.
- Yes,I do.  We're not getting out.

510
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,710
Well,we have to.

511
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,440
It's over.

512
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,900
It's not. It's not over.

513
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,770
Look,I'm helping those people.

514
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,910
- What about the plan?
- There's no plan,Donnie!

515
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,810
We're finished.

516
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,900
Wait!

517
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,090
Come on.

518
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,660
Let go of me.

519
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,940
Adam?

520
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:44,990
- Hey,boss? Donnie's mom just got here.
- Okay.

521
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:55,440
I'm Sergeant Greg Parker. I'm
in charge of the negotiation.

522
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,180
Christine Lakeman.

523
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:00,240
On the way over here,
an officer was telling me

524
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,230
what's going on inside with Donnie.

525
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:06,380
That Donnie shot someone. Is that true?

526
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,080
I'm afraid so,Christine.

527
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,260
The man's alive,but needs
immediate medical attention.

528
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,440
I know this is hard for you,

529
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,880
but can you tell me about your son?

530
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,150
Where do I start?

531
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:17,340
It's just... he's had
the year from hell.

532
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,350
Yeah.

533
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,470
Go on,please.

534
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:26,750
Well,he's never been
the same kid since...

535
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,200
since Travis passed away.

536
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,620
I'm sorry to hear that. Now,Travis...?

537
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,570
His brother. His big brother.

538
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,570
Donnie worshipped him.

539
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:39,470
Yeah. Could see that
must be tough on him.

540
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,230
Donnie's
father--

541
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,790
my
ex--

542
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,490
he-he left sometime after

543
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:52,260
and then Donnie just slid
from As to Cs to Ds and then...

544
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,680
He just got into all
sorts of trouble at school

545
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,990
and... All sorts of trouble.

546
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,810
Sergeant,please.

547
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:03,830
I have already lost one son,

548
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,950
and Donnie is all I have left,

549
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:10,560
and I can't... I c't lose my boy,please.

550
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,180
Christine,that's the
last thing I want to do.

551
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,850
I want to do everything I can to
g Donnie out of there safely,okay?

552
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,240
- All right?
- Thank you.

553
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,430
Here.

554
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,210
Where's my chopper?

555
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,120
We're still working on that,Donnie.

556
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,070
How do you know my name?

557
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,460
I spoke to your mom.

558
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,560
I spoke to both your moms.

559
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,130
and they're-they're
worried about you guys.

560
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,740
I know you're worried about Adam,too.

561
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,820
I hear he's moving away,huh?

562
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,990
Oh,he's not moving away.
He's not going anywhere.

563
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,140
Where's the chopper?

564
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,910
Is that what Adam wants,too?

565
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,950
I want the chopper!

566
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,890
Maybe I'm not making myself very clear.

567
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,230
So I'll make it very clear.

568
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,700
I want a chopper now!

569
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,450
Let's get Adam's cell phone number.

570
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:41,190
- Let's try to go through him.
- Copy that.

571
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,590
Freeze it.

572
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,140
Got it.

573
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,120
Text him,"This is rgeant
Parker. I want to help.

574
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,390
" Who's that?

575
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,730
My mom. Wants to know if I'm all right.

576
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:15,200
I'll get rid of her.

577
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,870
(Donnie's not a bad guy)

578
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,680
Okay.

579
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,910
"I understand,but we need
your help talking him down.

580
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,020
(He's lost it. I'm scared.)

581
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:34,210
" Don't be. I'll be with you.

582
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,470
What are you doing?

583
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,590
What were you doing with the phone?

584
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,900
What I said.

585
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,500
Texting my mom.

586
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,460
What,you don't believe me?

587
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,970
Come on,Donnie.

588
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,750
We got to get out of here.

589
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,100
What do you think
I've been trying to do?

590
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,890
- I mean,we got to walk out,hands in the air.
- No!

591
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,740
It will just be me and you.

592
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,920
Like it's always been.

593
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,440
Like it's always been.

594
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,880
Yeah. You and me.

595
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,580
Go.

596
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,740
Your girlfriend needs you.

597
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,750
Okay,guys,we got Adam cooperating here.

598
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,410
We're on a three-point plan.

599
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:37,520
Wordy's on a covert earbud delivery.

600
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,010
Ed and Sam,secure positions on the roof.

601
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:43,470
Spike and Donna,explosive entrs
through the front on my command.

602
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,060
I'll get a window charge ready.

603
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,620
Wordy,you locate the
entry to the vent yet?

604
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:53,860
Affirmative. You sure you want to let
a 17-year-old kid talk down an EUP?

605
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,270
We got a man down losing a lot of blood.

606
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:58,970
We got to move fast,and Adam's our
best option to end this right now.

607
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,700
That kid says the wrong thing,

608
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,860
it's going to get way out of hand.

609
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,670
Things always get way out of hand.

610
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,040
Hey,I'm in no hurry to pull the trigger

611
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,280
on someone barely old
enough to drive,all right?

612
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,750
Okay. This is good to go.

613
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,190
Ed,Sam,update!

614
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,500
We're on the move.

615
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,320
With haste,gentlemen. With haste!

616
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,660
Got to get these folks out of there.

617
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,510
I'm heading to the drop. Steer me in.

618
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,130
Yep,I got you on my screen,Wordy.

619
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,120
Taking the heating duct highway.

620
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,690
- Cozy,huh?
- Yeah,real cozy.

621
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,270
Is he okay?

622
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,290
He's shot.

623
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,410
Are you okay?

624
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,650
- How bad is he? Can I...

625
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,570
- Don't
-Don't touch it.Don't move it.

626
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,640
- I just want to see if you...

627
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,950
There's clotting in the blood
at the site of the wound.

628
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:45,400
If we move it now,we destroy all
the healing that's been happening.

629
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,170
I knew you could help him.

630
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:50,620
I help pull wisdom teeth.

631
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,530
I'm not a doctor.

632
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:55,760
Okay. That's it,Wordy. Keep going.

633
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,760
You're approaching a drop right now.

634
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,770
Okay,I see it coming.

635
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:07,290
Hey,Lew,how much weight are these
things ready to hold up,anyway?

636
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,610
I don't know,man. I guess
we're going to find out.

637
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:10,770
Great.

638
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,410
Thirsty.

639
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,270
I'm sorry. You can't have anything.

640
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,230
But they're going to have
us out of here at any minute,

641
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,930
and you'll be in surgery
before you know it.

642
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,680
Are you a doctor?

643
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,880
No. I'm...

644
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,480
I'm a medical professional.

645
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,100
Seconds away,boss.

646
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:00,850
One,two,three.

647
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,960
Wordy,how you doing?

648
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,470
Dropped the earbud.

649
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,370
Next time,remind me to bring a towel.

650
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,750
Copy.

651
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,350
Lew,text Adam.

652
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:14,210
Earpiece is waing,household
cleaners aisle.

653
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,260
- Good. 
- Yep.

654
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,580
This is your last chance.

655
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,740
Yeah,we're still working on it,Donnie.

656
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,360
That's what you said last time.

657
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,800
I know,and you're being really patient.

658
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,920
I want to thank you for that.

659
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,410
You're a smart guy.

660
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:36,280
What'd I tell you about playing me?

661
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:39,510
- Paper towels.
- I got to tell you,I'm running out of patience.

662
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,380
Sierra 1 in position.

663
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,500
Hey,Adam,look up.

664
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:05,480
Sierra 1 standing by.

665
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,340
Sierra 1,you have a solution?

666
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,580
I've got the solution.

667
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,130
Copy.

668
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,790
Entry team.

669
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,360
- Standing by for explosive entry.
- Copy.

670
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,460
Okay,Adam.

671
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,610
Now,don't let Donnie
get too close to you.

672
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:28,910
He'll see that earbud,all
right? Remember that.

673
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:31,810
Now,just talk to Donnie about
what he's been through this year.

674
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:34,450
Acknowledge how ha it must have been.

675
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:40,700
D... I know this year has
been the worst... ever.

676
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,920
Travis died and your dad bailed.

677
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,410
It's been brutal.

678
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:47,000
That's great. That's great.

679
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,090
You've always been there for him.

680
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:51,880
But you know I've always
been there for you,man.

681
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,310
I know.

682
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:57,620
And,Donnie,I-I'll
always be,no matter what.

683
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,770
No,you won't.

684
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,670
I shot a guy.

685
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,690
I'm going to prison,and
you're going to jail,too.

686
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:06,170
- No,that's not true.
- It is!

687
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,150
Now,Adam,it's gonna be okay.

688
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,640
It's gonna be okay.

689
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,990
Just... you're his friend.

690
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:14,430
Remember that. Just be his friend.

691
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:18,750
Okay,look... I'm not gonna lie to you.

692
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,460
All right,this situation sucks.

693
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,750
But... thing is...

694
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,300
You can get through it together.

695
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:31,740
But what?

696
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:35,290
Adam? What are you doing?

697
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,130
Adam,don't touch your ear.

698
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,280
Nothing.

699
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,450
What's that?

700
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,590
What the hell is that?!

701
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,840
Nothing! It's for my phone!

702
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,500
No,it's not. Who gave that to you?

703
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,520
No one. It's mine.

704
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,880
The cops?

705
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,710
How could you?

706
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:02,450
- Eddie,you got good eyes on this kid?
- Yeah.

707
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,260
- And what do you see?
- He's scared.

708
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,540
And what else?

709
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,760
Boss,barricaded subjects
usually stay elevated.

710
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,370
This kid's ping-ponging.

711
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:12,630
Okay,as long as he stays
deescalated,we stand down.

712
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:15,000
Sierra 1 standing by.

713
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,540
The cops?

714
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,310
You've been talking to the cops?

715
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,270
D,no. I...

716
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,610
It's all right,Adam. It's all right.

717
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:24,410
Just slow him down,ay?
Just slow him down.

718
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,100
They tell you to say all that?

719
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,100
- No,it was me.

720
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,170
- I thought that was you talking.
I thought that was my friend.

721
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,280
- I'm sorry. I was just
trying to get us out of this.

722
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,420
- I thought I could trust you.
- Donnie.

723
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,590
- Boss?
- Adam,we're done. Walk away.

724
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:37,300
- Stop listening to them!
- Put the gun down.

725
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,860
Get away. You think I won't do it?

726
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,920
I know you won't do it!

727
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:42,470
Donnie,please.

728
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,530
Sierra 1.

729
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:44,860
I've got the solution.

730
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,710
Donnie,give it to me. I'll do it.

731
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,100
I'll do it. I'll do it.

732
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,040
- Donnie,give it to me. It's over!
- No!

733
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:52,870
Scorpio.

734
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,000
Get out of my face.

735
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:59,390
No solution. No solution.

736
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:01,230
- You liar!
- Donnie!

737
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,860
Subject's on the move.
Sam,we're going down.

738
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,920
Where are you going?

739
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,650
Entry Team,go!

740
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:24,050
- In pursuit.
- Copy.

741
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:26,630
Hands on your head! Hands
on your head right now!

742
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,170
Stay down!

743
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,470
He's lost a lot of blood.

744
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,850
- I trusted you.
- Donnie,listen.

745
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:36,540
- Adam,get back. Get out of there.
- Oh,don't hu him!

746
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,170
- You sold me out.
- Put the gun down.

747
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:41,150
I was trying to get us out of this.

748
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,750
Drop the gun! Put the gun down.

749
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:46,060
Drop it! Put the gun down.

750
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:49,640
Donnie,I need you to put
the gun down. Do it now.

751
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,350
No. Let me talk to him.

752
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:55,060
Put it down,son. Put it down.

753
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,600
- Put it down!
- No.

754
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,690
Please! He'll listen to me.

755
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:01,080
He won't... He won't hurt me.

756
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,270
He hasn't got anybody else.

757
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:05,090
Get out of here. I got
nothing to say to you. Go!

758
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:07,090
I'm not going anywhere.

759
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:09,070
Donnie,it's gonna be okay.

760
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,940
Oh,it's gonna be okay

761
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,160
Look at... Look at me. It's not.

762
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,350
Boss?

763
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,730
Team,Donnie's at a breaking point here,

764
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,520
and he's dangerous to everyone in there.

765
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,500
Now,we got one shot at this.

766
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,260
Eddie,we got to save this
kid from himself here.

767
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:30,660
So,it's your call, but I ink we
got to let Adam talk to him again.

768
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:34,190
- Hey,Sam,that gun goes up,it's over.
- Copy.

769
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,070
Donnie?

770
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:39,060
What am I going to do?

771
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,070
What am I going to do?

772
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:47,470
Son,don't do it.

773
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,340
Don't do it,son.

774
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,980
Son?

775
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:54,310
Look,Donnie,it's me. Just me.

776
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,340
Listen,I don't
care where we are--

777
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:01,400
in Lethbridge,in jail.

778
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,770
Doesn't make a difference.

779
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:08,180
But you do this,it's all over.

780
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:11,420
Remember? We're brothers.

781
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:16,560
And brothers... need to
be there for each other.

782
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:19,860
Always?

783
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,060
Always.

784
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,730
Put the gun down.

785
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,110
That's it. That's it.

786
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:54,930
Yes. That's good work.
That is good work.

787
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:16,240
Look,I,uh... I just...I
wanted to say sorry

788
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,140
for riding you so hard.

789
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,120
I just had to know that your...

790
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,010
that your head's in the game,that's all.

791
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,510
No problem.

792
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,270
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Sam?

793
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:32,370
My girlfriend is gonna
break up with me tonight.

794
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,580
I didn't know you were seeing anybody.

795
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,750
Yeah,well. Anyway.

796
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,860
- You want to grab a beer first?
- No,I can't.

797
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,440
- Come on. I'm buying.
- Rain check.

798
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,370
All right,tomorrow night.

799
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:45,370
- Actually...
- Tomorrow.

800
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,100
Okay. That'd be good.

801
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,820
Maybe they weren't meant to be.

802
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,580
You know what? They never really
looked like a couple to me.

803
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,020
How'd you know there was something up?

804
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,320
I figured it out.

805
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,030
How'd you do that?

806
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:08,570
Because I'm special that way.

807
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,310
Yes,you are. Yes,you are.

808
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:16,400
Let me buy you a soda.

809
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,350
It's not if,it's when I'm going
to go back on the team,Sam.

810
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:25,850
Okay,so,the boss knows.

811
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:28,680
Right,which is exactly
why we can't be together

812
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,660
if I'm gonna go back. You know that.

813
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:37,900
I love you,Sam,but I've worked my
whole life for this j and the team,

814
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:43,020
and I'm not gonna let getting shot
stand in the way of me going back.

815
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,500
You mean I'm not going
to stand in your way?

816
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:50,190
Jules,that's the first time
you told me you loved me.

817
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,280
I didn't think it would be like this.

818
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,640
- Sam...
- Look,I get it.

819
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,570
I get it. I do.

820
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:01,760
Well,there's always the other
choice if we want to stay together.

821
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,960
Only one of us has to leave the team.
