00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,310
If you want to get out of here alive,

2
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,270
then you're going to tell
me what happened in New York.

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,000
Spike,what's going on? I need
eyes in.Get up there with Jules.

4
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,700
What do you want me to say?

5
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,270
I will know the truth when I hear it.

6
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,250
Alpha One and Two,requesting
permission to enter,sir.

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,190
We go through the skylight, we'll
spook her. She might use the knife.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,740
What have I done?What have I done?

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,810
Boss,I can see this. You're not
seeing it. Sam's not seeing it.

10
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,760
I can see it. We can be in
there within three seconds.

11
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:48,250
We'll disarm her. The knife is
down. Repeat: the knife is down.

12
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,630
We got to go in,boss. We got to risk it.

38
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:37,800
Last month, we sat
here in this same spot,

39
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,830
and I told you that your
chances were very,very slim,

40
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,380
and that I did not think that you
should go forward with another treatment.

41
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,100
I'm sorry to be so blunt,
but in good conscience,

42
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:55,060
I can't recommend that
you spend another $15,000.

43
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,270
Okay,all clear.

44
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,010
Not that I don't appreciate a little
excitement, but come on,I think we're safe.

45
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,760
You mind if I don't gamble
my career on what you think?

46
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,230
Unless one of your neighbors works
for the SRU, it's not much of a gamble.

47
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,410
Now,headquarters, that's another story.

48
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,820
I trust you have an entry plan.

49
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,720
Affirmative. I'm gonna drop
you off a few blocks away,

50
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,730
park my vehicle at HQ,
enter through the front.

51
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,090
You're gonna wait a few minutes,
stealth through the rear.

52
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,240
- I was kidding.
- Yeah,I'm not.

53
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,470
Sarah,when you get home, can you see
if I left my phone on the counter?

54
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,070
We're not giving up,right? We're not...

55
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,430
Oh,for God's sake,Sarah,we...

56
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,530
- we're not doing it again.
- Why?

57
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,960
We're not doing it again. I'm sorry.

58
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,530
I-I can't get back on
this roller coaster.

59
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,480
I can't keep feeling like every month is
some sort of test that we have to pass...

60
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,530
You know that's not true.

61
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,710
What else do you want to throw away,hmm?

62
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,830
I mean,what else gets thrown out the window
just in case maybe this time we're lucky.

63
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,540
What are you talking about,Josh?

64
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,170
Everything that we save, sweetheart.

65
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,250
Everything,everything that we hoped for.

66
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,010
You're the one giving up on our hope.

67
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,750
You threw away your work...

68
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,050
which you were damn good at.

69
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,530
And we agreed. We made
that decision together.

70
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,590
- Okay.
- We agreed that that was the right thing to do.

71
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,010
Because you wanted to relax.

72
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:29,020
You wanted to relax and read catalogs and dream
of babies in a house that we can't pay for anymore.

73
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,550
I never said I wanted that
house. I don't need a big house.

74
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,170
We'll move. We'll get a smaller house.

75
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,300
All our friends who have babies
you don't want to see anymore.

76
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,290
That's not true.

77
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,410
You can't go outside because you're scared
you're gonna see another frickin' stroller.

78
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,450
I went outside yesterday.

79
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,350
- Y-You went outside
yesterday? - Yes.

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,690
I've held your hand...

81
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,130
I've stayed up with you at
night. I've dreamed with you.

82
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,850
I've given up a lot that I care about.

83
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,520
I mean,I've done... everything
that I can do, but I-I...

84
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,400
I-I can't do this anymore.

85
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,030
You can't do what?

86
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,550
You know what? I-I should... I'm
gonna go to work. I have to go to work.

87
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,400
- What are you saying?
- I have to go.

88
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,920
- Josh!
- Sarah.

89
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,560
Josh! G... Josh.

90
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,330
What are you saying?

91
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,650
********She keeps putting
my pants in the dryer.

92
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,140
Hold up. Hold up. Your mom
still does your laundry?

93
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,920
Hey,she's Italian,okay?
Try and stop her.

94
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,000
Gentlemen.

95
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,970
Missed you at choir
practice last night,man.

96
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,780
That's another round you owe
the boys. Don't let that add up.

97
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:51,660
You know what? I lay down for 20 minutes,
I opened my eyes, suddenly it was 6:00 a.m.

98
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,180
I hate when that happens.

99
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,670
Samtastic sleeping alone.

100
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,810
What's this world coming to?

101
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,240
Ed,we patrolling today?

102
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,110
All right,listen up. The El
Colera gang has three strongholds.

103
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,810
We are gonna split up and cover 'em all.

104
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,930
Boss wants us out in
five, so let's go,ladies.

105
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:58,010

- How did it go with the guys this morning?
- Fine. Don't worry.

It's nobody's business.
We're professionals.

Absolutely. You are
utterly professional.

Yeah. Yeah,I'm good. I'm good.

'Cause,uh,the other
day at the station...

124
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,570
Oh,come on. Here we go.

125
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,850
- What?
- Look,I'm just saying.

126
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,510
You look through the scope, and
you see things that aren't there.

127
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,310
Maybe you need a break from the action.

128
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,630
When was the last
time you had a day off?

129
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,030
I don't need a day off.

130
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:54,120
Hey,we could all use a day off,Ed.

131
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:58,440
All right, thanks,Oprah. I forgot
what a joy it was to ride with you.

132
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,990
Hello.

133
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,850
- Mrs. Scott?
- You must be Hannah.

134
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,950
I'm,um... I write for... Wired
Magazine. I'm here to see Joshua?

135
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,620
Of course. Come in.

136
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,550
- If this is a-a bad time,I
could... - No. No,it's a good time.

137
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,270
Please,come in. Sit down.

138
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,350
You have a lovely home.

139
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:47,320
Thank you.

140
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,730

141
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,540
Sure. Thank you.

00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:11,320
He's,um... He's at work a-actually.

143
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,620
I'm sorry. I thought he was here.

144
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,770
I-I wanted to talk to you.

145
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,580
I'm s... Youtexted me?

146
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,060
I want to know about you and-and him.

147

How do you mean?

148
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,750
I think you know what I mean.

149
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:44,020
Do you know what? I'm gonna go. I'm
sorry that I... that I bothered you.

150
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,590
- Please don't.
- Excuse me.

151
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,170
- I-I have
to... - Don't go.

152
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,330
- You let me go!
- Not until you tell me the truth.

153
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,400
Look,I just... I just
want... I just want the truth.

154
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,510
Okay.

155
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:00,470
So you stay until we talk. Okay?

156
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,540
All right. Okay,we can talk.

157
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,400
- I'm calling the police!
- Don't. No,don't!

158
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,840
Put it down! Just stay...
Just stay away from me.

159
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:09,990
No. No,don't do that.

160
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,180
- Oh,my God. Help me.
- Put that down!

168

911 came in ten minutes
ago. Dispatch flagged it.

169

There's been a wave of violent
home invasions in the neighborhood.

00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,830
Same grid. Copy that.

172
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,210
Underground Boys?

173
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,710
Four in the last two weeks, and all
four came through the basement windows.

174
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,290
Last week,they found some woman at
home,tied her up and robbed the place.

175
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,000
Kira,play the 911,would ya?

176
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,240
Here it comes.

177
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:19,200
Oh,my God! Help me,please!
Help me,please! Help!

178
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,200
Put that down!

179
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,650
How far are you guys?

180
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,790
Three minutes.

181
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,860
Okay,don't approach without
cover. They could be expecting us.

182
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,420
Get some intel. Hold off on
entry until we go in as a team.

183
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,440
Got it.

184
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,610
No signs of forced entry
on black or white wall.

185
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,600
Okay. No broken basement windows?

186
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,790
That's a negative.

187
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,940
Maybe the Underground
Boys are trying a new MO.

188
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,470
Could be something else. Who knows?

189
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,220
Sarah and Josh Scott. She's an
illustrator. Works from home.

190
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,240
He runs a software design company.

191
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,910
Neighbor saw them leave together early this
morning, but she returned home alone around 9:15.

192
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,050
That doesn't sound
like a domestic,does it?

193
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,550
Unless the guy came back and walked in on the
wife doing something she didn't want him to see.

194
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,230
Or she opened the door
to the intruders herself.

195
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,770
Sam,let's move forward on this.

196
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,920
Make contact,but go careful.

197
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,070
Yes,sir.

198
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,080
Jules,I'm dialing in.

199
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:34,180
Kira,can you patch me through
to the source of the 911?

200
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,860
Come on.

201
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:46,240
This is Sam Braddock from the
Police Strategic Response Unit.

202
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:51,370
We're here to resolve the situation, but
we can't help unless you pick up the phone.

203
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,050
We got movement on white Alpha Two.

204
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,540
Throw phone?

205
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,190
Okay,team, it's not a domestic.

206
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,430
The husband was at work,
and he's on his way.

207
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,420
Boss,we're thinking about a throw phone.

208
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,990
If they pick it up, it
will limit their movements.

209
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,990
If they don't,we'll have
the open mike on our side.

210
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,150
All right,copy that.

211
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,310
Here's something weird. I just
talked to the alarm company.

212
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,870
The alarm hasn't been triggered today,
and it was armed a few minutes ago.

213
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,020
So,what,the intruders come in
and then she sets the alarm?

214
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,960
How does that work?

215
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:25,960
If someone's pointing a gun at you and they
tell you to punch in the code,you'd do it.

216
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,510
How far are we?

217
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,580
Two minutes out.

218
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,890
Please step away from your window.

219
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,420
We are throwing a phone into the house.

220
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,270
The window's going to break.

221
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,430
What the hell was that?

222
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,640
Please,please answer!

223
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,760
- Please talk to them!
- Shut up!

224
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,660
Shut up! You don't get
to tell me what to do!

225
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,300
Don't tell me what to do!

226
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,800
This is Sam Braddock from the
Police Strategic Response Unit.

227
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,610
Get away from my house!

228
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,590
This is Sarah?

229
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:24,910
Get down and stay down! Stay down!

230
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,870
- Don't... don't move!
- Okay!

231
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,470
I just... I-I just want the truth!

232
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,160
- Sarah!
- Don't!

233
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,960
Sarah!

234
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,590
Just tell me the truth!

235
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,860
Sarge,we lost the ear. She threw
the phone out. It's escalating.

236
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,390
Okay,we have a hostage
situation with an unknown weapon.

237
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,940
Talk is number one.

238
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,690
But be ready with an immediate
action if the hostage is threatened.

239
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,690
Spike,you're less lethal.
Jules,you're Sierra One.

240
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,970
Let's set up the LADD. Number
one on white, number two on black.

241
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,510
At least we can keep listening.

242
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,070
Copy that.

243
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,580
Sam,I want you to say on the loudhailer.

244
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,330
Be persistent with no pressure.

245
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,400
You're not taking over?

246
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,370
- Negative.
- Copy that.

247
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,620
Sarah,I'd really like to know...

248
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,680
I don't know what you're talking about.

249
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,330
I need to make sure
everyone's okay in there,Sarah.

250
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,530
Ed,I'm gonna run tactics.

251
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,040
You and Lou run Command Post.

252
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,100
Wha... Command Post?

253
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,290
Oprah says.

254
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,360
Yes,sir.

255
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:57,500
Let's get a list of all the
license plates parked nearby.

256
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,340
- What?
- You... in the truck.

257
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,470
What can I tell you?

258
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,210
It's backwards day.

259
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,350
- Let me through. Get out of my way.
- Sir...

260
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,330
Get out of my way. My wife's
in there. Let me through.

261
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,260
Sarah! Let go of me!

262
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:19,240
Joshua Scott. Mr. Scott.

263
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,840
Thank you,Constable.

264
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,830
What are you doing?

265
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,210
We can't let you come any closer.

266
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,560
My wife is in there. She's
in danger. What are you doing?

267
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,130
Sir,we're not sure it was your
wife that placed the 911 call.

268
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,130
What do you mean?

269
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,600
We believe your wife is holding
someone in there against their will.

270
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,900
Sarah?

271
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,300
No,Sarah would never do that.

272
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,760
Sir,are there any firearms in the house?

273
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,430
No,there's no firearms in the house.

274
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,230
Stand back,sir,please.

275
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,090
Team,husband claims there
are no guns in the house.

276
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,600
We might be looking at a
knife, scissors, razor blade.

277
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,730
Look,she would just never do that.

278
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,740
- Sir,I can't have you do that. You need to step back.
- Okay,okay.

279
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,200
Now I need you to help me.

280
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,710
I need you to help me
with some answers,okay?

281
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,520
What can you tell me about
her state of mind this morning?

282
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,060
She was upset. We had
a fight,an argument.

283
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,400
Your wife isn there with an
unknown weapon and a hostage,

284
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,830
and we don't want to
make her more upset,okay?

285
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,780
I don't think it's a good idea if she
sees you through the window right now.

286
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,990
- Okay.
- You got to trust me on this. This is what we do.

287
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,180
Okay.

288
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,390
Okay,I want you to come into the truck over
here. Talk to my guys, tell 'em what you know.

289
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:28,030
******Unknown weapon.

290
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,320
*******Sarah Scott.

291
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,310
Unidentified hostage.

292
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:35,210
Sergeant Parker to direct tactical plan.

293
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:39,290
How you doing? I'm Ed Lane. Louis Young.

294
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,370
Have a seat, please,Josh.

295
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:46,190
You texted him twice this morning.

296
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,310
It's professional. I told you.

297
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,700
You're lying.

298
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,590
What about "Yesterday was amazing"?

299
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,550
Any movement?

300
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,040
No,but I definitely scared
them away from the windows.

301
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,590
A little aggressive,huh?

302
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,410
You're doing good.

303
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,630
Okay.

304
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,010
Move as soon as we
got a position on 'em.

305
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,100
Copy.

306
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,310
Gordy,we got ears yet?

307
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,450
Getting an audio signal.

308
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,500
- Please!
- Tell me the truth!

309
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,210
If we could just go outside,please?

310
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,680
You can just talk to your husband.

311
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,800
Please,let me talk to my wife.

312
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,730
Josh,we can't right now. We can't.

313
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,570
Spike's on Less Lethal.

314
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,060
Boss gonna need you with the gas.

315
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,460
What do you mean,"lethal"?

316
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,580
Josh,Plan A is less lethal.

317
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,560
Less lethal?

318
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,980
Rubber bullets.

319
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,770
How can you be less dead?

320
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,930
We dislodge the weapon,
restrain the subject.

321
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,310
This is insane.

322
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,450
You have all this hardware for
an upset woman with maybe a knife.

323
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,710
Knife's as bad as a gun.

324
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:12,130
It never sticks,never jams, never runs out of ammo
and you don't need traing to know how to use it.

325
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,490
So just sit down and calm yourself.

326
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,690
Please,please, I'm so scared! Please?

327
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:27,080
I've got eyes. Female hostage.
Knife confirmed. Threat imminent.

328
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:30,060
- Spike,stand by.
- Copy.

329
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,170
On my go.

330
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:37,400
Please don't hurt me! I'm pregnant!

331
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,030
She's pregnant. Hostage is pregnant.

332
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:49,120
Stand down! Stand down. Stand
down. We got a pregnant hostage.

333
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,100
You...

334
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,150
you're having his baby?

335
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,410
No.

336
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,770
You're having his baby.

337
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:08,350
Your having his...

338
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,740
I knew it. I knew that there
was a reason that,that...

339
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,610
why he'd given up. It was you.

340
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,610
Please,you're not making sense.

341
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,580
You're coming with me.

342
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:26,460
- Please,you need to talk to someone.
- Get up!

343
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:30,380
Okay,team,new rules: No Taser,no
CS gas and no rubber bullets.

344
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,960
Not a lot of tools in the toolkit.

345
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,170
Gordy,we hear anything yet?

346
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,830
Yeah,it's not clear.

347
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,700
Please! Please!

348
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,880
Go up the stairs.

349
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,610
- They're wrestling.
- Spike?

350
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,520
I've lost them. I've lost visual.

351
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,630
Boss,let me send in
some gas, clear them out.

352
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,170
Negative. She's pregnant.

353
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,960
We got to go in,boss. We got to risk it.

354
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:03,010
No!

355
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:13,830
Enough!

356
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,380
Please watch out for the baby!

357
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,360
Enough!

358
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:24,240
Enough,enough. Enough. Enough.

359
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,380
Please,please don't hurt the baby.

360
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:32,240
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

361
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:36,200
Come on. Let's go. Upstairs.

362
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,200
I need to show you something.

363
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,400
So you have no idea who this woman is?

364
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,660
No.

365
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,870
Your wife thinks you're
having an affair with her,Josh.

366
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,990
I am,I am not having an affair.

367
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,850
You understand the risk
you're taking if you lie to me?

368
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,630
I love my wife.

369
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,480
We had a tough time, but I love my wife.

370
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:59,390
I understand that, but what I don't
understand is who she has in that room with her

371
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,060
and why she has a knife to her throat.

372
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,460
Mr. Scott, we need you to draw
a floor plan of your house.

373
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,790
Both floors,Josh.

374
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:07,540
Every door-- which way
it opens and every window.

375
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,530
- Okay.
- Thank you.

376
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,930
Eddie,Eddie,what's he saying?

377
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,360
That he's not involved with anyone.

378
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,590
- You believe him?
- No.

379
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,890
Okay,she says she wants
the truth,and so do I.

380
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,490
He was saying they were having a fight
this morning, talking about having a baby.

381
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,660
Let's see how that escalated before
this knife starts swinging again.

382
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,610
Lou,I want you to patch
me in on this conversation.

383
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,950
I want Sam and I to hear it.

384
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,010
Copy that.

385
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,760
Sarah,it's Sam.

386
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,930
I'm trying to phone
again. Please pick up.

387
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,530
Did he tell you about this?

388
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,090
What?

389
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:57,410
About the eight years?

390
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,700
I don't know. I don't
know what you're saying.

391
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:05,810
Shut up! Over there. Get over there.

392
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,110
Sit down!

393
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:14,230
I interviewed him for the conference
in New York forWiredmagazine.

394
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,930
We had tea.

395
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,110
That's what I meant by
"yesterday was amazing."

396
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:23,910
- You're lying.
- The interview... The interview was amazing.

397
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,800
Sarah,I need you to come to the phone
so we can talk about your safety.

398
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,790
- What did you just do?
- Nothing.

399
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,280
- What did you just do?
- Nothing.

400
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,750
We've been trying to have
a baby for eight years.

401
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:50,090
Eight years of hormone
shots, IVF treatments.

402
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:53,080
We took out loans. We
drained the accounts.

403
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,520
It looks like we can afford it,right?

404
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,380
But we couldn't.

405
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,570
A year ago we get pregnant, finally.

406
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,790
But we didn't want to tell anyone
because we wanted to be sure.

407
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,790
So we waited-- one
month,two months,three...

408
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:11,770
At four months,we made this...

409
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,820
we made this room for the baby.

410
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:18,380
We let ourselves believe.

411
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:23,670
We told everyone.

412
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,780
And we lost it.

413
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,970
How'd she handle it?

414
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,840
She fought back. She's a fighter.

415
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:33,130
I didn't want to give up.

416
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,720
For him.

417
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,640
He should be a father.

418
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:44,180
Is she delusional? Mentally unstable?

419
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:47,250
No. No,I mean she...

420
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,810
she was depressed for a
while, but she's not deluded.

421
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,920
Then tell me why she thinks you're having
an affair with a total stranger,Josh?

422
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:55,910
Boss,we're picking up
some kind of audio signal.

423
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,060
What kind of audio signal?

424
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,270
From the house, intercom maybe.

425
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,180
Patch it in.

426
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,050
- Josh,you guys have an intercom at your house?
- No.

427
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:06,090
Walkie-talkies, anything?
We're picking up voices here.

428
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:09,500
I mean,we have a baby
monitor, but it wouldn't be on.

429
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,590
Where?

430
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,120
- In the nursery.
- What floor?

431
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,660
It's on the second
floor, front of the house.

432
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,260
Can you get it any clearer,Lou?

433
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:19,090
I'm working on it.

434
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:26,180
Okay,team, we know we're not welcome
here, so let's go stealth, low and slow.

435
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,980
Spike and Wordy, I want
you on entry with me. Jules.

436
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,310
My cousin has a baby monitor.

437
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:33,500
It's a two-way, so the kid can
hear the parents. It's worth a try.

438
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,910
Okay,try to tap into that frequency.

439
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,300
Sam,she's not going
to answer that phone.

440
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,390
We'll try this way in.

441
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:39,730
Jules,I want you to find a
scorpio position on the roof.

442
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,420
I think I saw a skylight
up there. That'll be Plan B.

443
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,970
And bring a camera pole.

444
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:54,760
I just need to get through this without
you trying something again. Okay?

445
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,800
Okay,we got ears, and we're
good to talk anytime you say,Sam.

446
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,770
Channel 4.

447
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:05,420
Good work,Lou. I'm gonna need you on
entry with me, and get the husband's keys.

448
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:16,120
If you want to get out of here alive,

449
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:20,440
then you're going to tell
me what happened in New York.

450
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:26,570
You're going to tell me
why you were there with him.

451
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,000
What happened after tea?

452
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,130
Nothing.

453
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,360
What was so amazing then,hmm?

454
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:43,870
What do you want me to say?

455
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:47,530
Huh,what do you want?

456
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,960
I lose either way,right?

457
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:56,260
What kind of answer do you expect when
you wave a knife in someone's face?

458
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:01,720
I will know the truth when I hear it.

459
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,790
You're not going to like the truth.

460
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,610
Go,Kira.

461
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,910
License plates coming at you.

462
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,070
All right, let's see what we got.

463
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,170
Josh,you recognize any of these?

464
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,190
Hannah Murray.

465
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,630
Oh,my God.

466
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,130
She rented a car that's parked
down the street. You know her?

467
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:44,140
She's a reporter from New York.

468
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,780
How do you know her?

469
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,170
Why would she... I
haven't seen her since...

470
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,840
Since when, Josh,since when?

471
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,490
Are you telling me that you
had a thing with this woman?

472
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,950
We got to know,buddy, 'cause if
you did, that changes everything.

473
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,580
I did.

474
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,580
I've known Josh for 18 years.

475
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:09,060
Before Sarah, we were
friends,really close,

476
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,540
but never more than friends.

477
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:15,760
From the first moment we met, we
had a connection, you know,like...

478
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,350
a really strong connection like...

479
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,410
the ones you can't really explain.

480
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:29,840
And we lost touch, and then one
day, I'm in New York in a conference,

481
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,140
and we bump into each other and sh...

482
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,640
she asked me if she could interview me.

483
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,950
Then I'm talking to him face
to face after all these years,

484
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:45,040
and it's like no time has passed.

485
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:48,430
Sarah and I were in
this really bad place.

486
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:52,500
I mean,I don't want blame it
on fertility treatments,but...

487
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:58,010
He said somewhere in there it was like you two
stopped having anything to say to each other.

488
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:02,230
Every conversation was about:
when's the next doctor's appointment,

489
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,960
what are the odds, how,how are we going
to afford to pay for the next treatment?

490
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:10,040
And,you know,I-I don't want to
sound like I'm making excuses.

491
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,850
I-I don't want to make ex... oh,my God.

492
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:16,150
Josh was still Josh, but he'd changed.

493
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,630
I could see that.

494
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:24,230
He was sadder, like the life
had gone out of him. like...

495
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,440
like he'd forgotten how to laugh.

496
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,520
And you,you laughed.

497
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:37,790
Afterwards, I'm lying next to her,
and all I can think about is Sarah,

498
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:41,340
and I'm thinking to
myself, "What have I done?"

499
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,280
Spike,what's going on? I need eyes in.

500
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,020
Barricaded?

501
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:51,160
Sarah saw my father through
three rounds of chemo.

502
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:57,640
You know, she was there in the
hospital with me when my father died.

503
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,050
Oh,my God.

504
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:06,380
That one night was the
biggest mistake of my life.

505
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:11,230
It was the night that was always
meant to be. It was just 15 years late.

506
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,390
That night...

507
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,630
Oh,my God, he came alive again.

508
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,940
All right,I'm in position.

509
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,820
No joy yet-- I'm going
to try the camera pole.

510
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:30,500
Spike, get up there with Jules.

511
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:37,990
Sam,Sam, this is our last chance.

512
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:41,260
Unless you got something to go on, I got
to send Jules in on an explosive entry.

513
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:45,250
No,hold on the entry. Patch me into
the room. Let me give it a shot.

514
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:48,490
I couldn't tell Sarah,
I just... I couldn't.

515
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:54,710
You know,and when I got back, when I got
back,every time I looked at her, I just...

516
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,290
I loved her more, and I was so
scared that I was going to lose her,

517
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,840
you know,and that just,
that just changed everything.

518
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:05,060
It changed everything.

519
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:09,050
What have I done? What have I done?

520
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:13,370
Josh,you told us the truth.

521
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,520
You did the right thing.

522
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,680
***********

523
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,890
Yeah.

524
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,480
It's on channel 4.

525
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:29,520
- The baby...
- Yeah.

526
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,650
Is Josh the father?

527
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,910
Sarah? It's Sam,Sarah.

528
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,070
We were able to open a frequency
on that monitor in your room.

529
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:50,770
They're talking about
sending a team in there.

530
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:54,080
I don't want to send anyone in.
I want you to come out,Sarah.

531
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:57,340
Oh,God...

532
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,440
It's you.

533
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,180
That's why he gave up so easily.

534
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,270
'Cause...

535
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,410
he wants to be with you.

536
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,770
And the baby.

537
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,300
Sarah,please,I need you to listen to me.

538
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,480
You know what he promised me?

539
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:22,640
He promised me...

540
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:27,570
no matter what, through thick
and thin, we'd be together.

541
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,280
Is that what she's saying?

542
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:33,510
That's what she's saying?

543
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,720
And I don't think any
of that's changed,Sarah.

544
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,240
No,no,no.

545
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:42,720
No,because when he got back
from New York, he was changed.

546
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,690
He was different.

547
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,790
Like he was trying too hard.

548
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:54,840
when the doctor told us to stop
trying, I couldn't stop crying.

549
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:00,870
He didn't cry. Not once.

550
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,220
Tell her I did. I...
I just... it was just...

551
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:07,860
just never in front of her, 'cause I
wanted to be strong for her,I wanted...

552
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,990
I wanted to be strong for...

553
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:19,600
Look,just t-tell her I'm here.
Tell her that I... that I love her.

554
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,840
T-Tell her about the Bridge of Sighs.

555
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,420
Tell her about the Bridge of Sighs.

556
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,510
Boss,you get that entry option
lined up, you've got to go for it.

557
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,100
No,Ed,hold it.

558
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:30,360
Give the husband a headset.

559
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,160
Mr. Scott?

560
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,060
This is Sam Braddock; I'm
the guy talking to your wife.

561
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,040
Tell me about the Bridge of Sighs.

562
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,930
I got eyes.

563
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:42,860
Tell me.

564
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:44,890
Knife is pointed down.

565
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:46,120
What's the subject's state?

566
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:50,270
She's crying,distracted. Boss,threat
is low. I can do this. I can see access.

567
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,270
Alpha One and Two,requesting
permission to enter,sir.

568
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:54,910
We go through the
skylight, we'll spook her.

569
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,380
She might use the knife.

570
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,420
Sir,she does not want to use that knife.

571
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,560
Do you know that?

572
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,230
This isn't aggression
anymore. This is grief.

573
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,430
She's almost done. She
just wants the truth.

574
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,620
Boss,I can see this. You're not seeing
it. Sam's not seeing it. I can see it.

575
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:11,610
We can be in there within
three seconds. We'll disarm her.

576
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,780
The knife is down.
Repeat: the knife is down.

577
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,650
The truth is the only
thing she's been asking for,

578
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:18,190
her one demand, and
she's not getting it.

579
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,000
Okay. Okay,the knife
is still in her hand.

580
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:26,260
Constable Braddock will
continue with negotiation.

581
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:34,470
Sarah?

582
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:35,980
Do you know what?

583
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:38,700
I'm really not that
great with words,but...

584
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,110
but I've been talking to a guy who is.

585
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,920
And he's been telling
me a lot about you.

586
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:48,680
About how he made a big mistake,
about how much he loves you...

587
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,630
That's not true!

588
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:55,900
And he wanted me to tell you...

589
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:58,320
about the Bridge of Sighs.

590
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:00,190
When my father died...

591
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:03,900
And when his father died
and he'd lost his job,

592
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:06,290
you bought two tickets to Venice,

593
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,120
and you said you'd walk over
the Bridge of Sighs together.

594
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:13,850
Yeah. To gain perspective.

595
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,380
When you've been through so many...

596
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,860
losses together...

597
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,690
you're connected, you
belong to each other.

598
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,450
Always.

599
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,930
Sarah,Josh loves you.

600
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:30,160
It's taking about six of us to stop
him from rushing in there,Sarah.

601
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:32,150
You want the truth?

602
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:36,170
This is it: he loves you.

603
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,370
Subject is down. Hostage has weapon.

604
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,890
Go,go,go,go!

605
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:56,850
Move away from the door!
Move away from the door!

606
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,470
Down! Stay down! Put your
hands where I can see them!

607
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,760
- Stay down!
- Stay on the ground. Stay on the ground.

608
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:06,170
Keep your hands where I can see them.

609
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,920
Eddie,paramedics,right away.

610
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,250
Hey,buddy, what's her status?

611
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:23,840
Unstable. Knife hit a major
vessel. Massive blood loss.

612
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:28,240
Sarah... Oh,my God.

613
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,210
Is she gonna be all right?

614
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,600
We'll take care of her.

615
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:43,340
There. We'll get you in an
ambulance. They'll take a look at you.

616
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,920
Okaycome on.

617
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,880
Sarah,Sarah...

618
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,810
the hospital where the doc
will take a look at you.

619
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,490
This didn't have to happen.
This did not have to happen.

620
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,660
There are always variables
that we can't anticipate.

621
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,940
But,Sarge, we could've saved them both.

622
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,120
There's no way we could know.

623
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:11,740
"11:06 a.m.Callaghan: Boss,threat
is low. "I can do this. I see access.

624
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:15,030
"Braddock: She wants the truth.
She's responding. Give me a shot."

625
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,660
It was a risk either way.

626
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,290
Blah,blah,blah, blah,blah,blah.

627
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,840
"11:09 a.m. "Alpha One and Two, "explosive
entry through Black Charlie Three."

628
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:25,570
I had a connection. She did
not need to be subdued by force.

629
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:29,480
"Subject was lying prone on the
floor, a knife wound to the chest."

630
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,740
We know,Jules. We were there.

631
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,890
"11:17. Subject in critical
condition. Taken to hospital."

632
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,910
We were there.

633
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,790
I had eyes in. There was time
to get in. The knife was down.

634
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,220
And then the hostage escalated.

635
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,650
Which she wouldn't have
if we'd already gone in.

636
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,250
Sam,you were the negotiator.

637
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,970
It's your right to
call it how you see it.

638
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,050
We can't second-guess whether an earlier tactical
response might have had a different outcome.

639
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,750
Due respect,sir,but it came
down to talk or tactics,

640
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,130
and you're the one that called talk.

641
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:53,890
That's right.

642
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,780
Because maybe that's the
call a negotiator would make.

643
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,250
Look,I'm just saying, all right?

644
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,680
I want to know what Ed would have done.

645
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,370
It was the sarge's call!

646
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,810
I want to know,too.

647
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:08,650
Sometimes you do everything right.

648
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,520
Things still go wrong.

649
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,740
That's the job.

650
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,030
Situation was gray.

651
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:19,510
The boss made a
black-and-white call.

652
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:23,390
We saved the hostage. Period.

653
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:28,630
Uh,sorry. The hospital
just called. Sarah Scott.

654
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,370
Doctors got her stabilized.
She's gonna be all right.

655
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:36,960
- That's great,Kira. Thanks for letting us know.
- Okay.

656
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:51,130
Okay,then. That's good. Right?

657
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:31,240
- Need to talk.
- Take a number.

658
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,560
All right. I'll see you tomorrow.

659
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:37,810
Hey,Eddie.

660
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:42,100
I'm sorry.

661
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:44,410
Today should have gone better.

662
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:48,490
You need to be back where you belong.

663
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:51,080
Team needs you back.

664
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:57,130
I'm thinking,I'm-I'm gonna
get Soph,I'm gonna get Clark.

665
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:01,190
We're gonna go up and get a
cottage,you know? Regroup,like you...

666
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,650
Like you said.

667
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,760
That's great. That's great.

668
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:10,250
You know,unless,uh, you feel
useless or something without me.

669
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,910
Decent.

670
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,210
I'm sorry.

671
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,470
I shouldn't have
jumped on you like that.

672
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,140
No,it's okay. I get it.

673
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,430
We all wanted them out safe.

674
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,880
What?

675
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,490
I don't know if we should do this.

676
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:39,020
Sneaking around on the team.

677
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:42,480
We put our lives in
each other's hands,and...

678
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,280
Yeah,and you're thinking
we should take a break.

679
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,180
I don't know. I don't
know what I'm thinking.

680
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:54,180
Me,neither.

681
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:56,580
Okay,so,take a break tonight?

682
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,020
Give us time to think?

683
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:05,380
Or we could think while
priming my drywall.

684
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:09,230
That's not fair.

685
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,630
You know how much I
love priming drywall.

686
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:17,560
Yeah,almost as much as you love my
protein-mango breakfast smoothies.

687
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:19,620
Don't do this to me.

688
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:22,580
I'm just saying.

689
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,560
It's all clear.

690
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:39,340
