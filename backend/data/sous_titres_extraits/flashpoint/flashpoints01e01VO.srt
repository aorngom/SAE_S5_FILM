St. Catherine station.

77
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,791
So,what'd you think?

78
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:01,613
I told them not to waste my time.

79
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:03,220
Bremler didn't live up to specs.

80
00:04:03,247 --> 00:04:03,871
Really?

81
00:04:03,898 --> 00:04:05,171

84
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:09,700
Oh,yeah?

85
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:10,720
What did you think of
that double trigger?

86
00:04:10,746 --> 00:04:13,331
Pssh. She's jam away.

87
00:04:13,358 --> 00:04:15,201
better pray for a fat target.

88
00:04:15,215 --> 00:04:17,041
I mean,it's a
sweet-looking piece but...

89
00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:19,630
it's all sass,no class!

90
00:04:19,648 --> 00:04:21,092
Well,that's a good match for you.

91
00:04:21,106 --> 00:04:23,653

00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:38,883
No. No?

100
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:39,751

101
00:04:39,765 --> 00:04:41,210

His last big bust is what,two
kids and a couple of joints?

110
00:04:53,308 --> 00:04:56,062
I know,if every day was christmas it

197
00:10:01,777 --> 00:10:02,733

First york plaza,north of the square.

Immediate backup.

202
00:10:16,377 --> 00:10:17,853
Extreme caution.

203
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:18,740
Bystanders.

204
00:10:18,757 --> 00:10:20,071
Hostage.

205
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:20,690
Rangefinders?

206
00:10:20,707 --> 00:10:21,372
Check.

207
00:10:21,395 --> 00:10:22,130
Bipods?

208
00:10:22,146 --> 00:10:23,751
Check.

209
00:10:24,235 --> 00:10:25,613
so how'd it go last night?

210
00:10:25,628 --> 00:10:26,763
Great.

211
00:10:26,777 --> 00:10:28,780
Hunh. Really?

212
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,240
Battery packs loaded?

213
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:32,582
Yup.

214
00:10:33,756 --> 00:10:34,342
And?

215
00:10:34,355 --> 00:10:36,822
And it was great.

216
00:10:38,648 --> 00:10:39,770
And?

217
00:10:39,788 --> 00:10:41,671
And what?

218
00:10:41,695 --> 00:10:43,433
What happened?

219
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:46,781
You wanted to snuggle up
in front of the tv,right?

220
00:10:47,508 --> 00:10:51,740
It's just I'm sitting there and all I can
think about is I wanna finish my drywall.

221
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,880
team one,let's saddle up.

222
00:10:52,898 --> 00:10:53,801
We got a call.

223
00:10:53,818 --> 00:10:55,240
Let's suit up.

224
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:56,861
Change of plans.

225
00:10:56,876 --> 00:10:57,613
Game on.

226
00:10:57,638 --> 00:10:59,543
Showtime,baby.

227
00:11:14,117 --> 00:11:15,213
First york plaza,copy.

228
00:11:15,235 --> 00:11:16,061
What's the guy carrying?

229
00:11:16,097 --> 00:11:16,902
A luger.

230
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,380
Oh,a luger?

231
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:19,531
First victim's critical.

232
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,312
Now he's got a hostage,female.

233
00:11:21,325 --> 00:11:23,042
Got it onscreen. Where's he at?

234
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:23,772
North square.

235
00:11:23,787 --> 00:11:26,150
Heavy on civilians,so
let's go careful out there.

236
00:11:26,176 --> 00:11:27,580
Over.

237
00:11:27,595 --> 00:11:28,241
Morning.

238
00:11:28,258 --> 00:11:29,481
Good mornin'!

239
00:11:29,498 --> 00:11:30,742
Let's break it down.

240
00:11:30,768 --> 00:11:33,431
8:30 in the morning,rush
hour,business district.

241
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,943
Place is gonna be packed.

242
00:11:34,966 --> 00:11:37,292
Which means we gotta
go high. You take...

243
00:11:37,307 --> 00:11:38,572
north building. You counter...

244
00:11:38,587 --> 00:11:39,563
west.

245
00:11:39,578 --> 00:11:40,321
Too high.

246
00:11:40,345 --> 00:11:41,141
East.

247
00:11:41,157 --> 00:11:41,780
East gives us...

248
00:11:41,795 --> 00:11:42,803
Maximum coverage.

249
00:11:42,815 --> 00:11:44,433
Don't want the guy runnin'
and both of us losing him.

250
00:11:44,447 --> 00:11:45,832
Right. What else?

251
00:11:45,846 --> 00:11:46,592
What do you mean what else?

252
00:11:46,616 --> 00:11:47,653
This gonna be crazy.

253
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:51,522
Damn right it's gonna be crazy; every unit
in the city's gonna want a piece of this.

254
00:11:51,536 --> 00:11:53,431
And I'm sierra one.

255
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:57,101
Oh yeah,I'm sierra one.

256
00:11:57,118 --> 00:11:58,683
chill.

257
00:11:59,728 --> 00:12:01,352
I'm just sayin'.

258
00:12:14,596 --> 00:12:16,853
There's nowhere to go.

259
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,342
this is going nowhere.

260
00:12:21,188 --> 00:12:23,263
here comes the cavalry.

261
00:12:34,757 --> 00:12:37,951
Dispatch,be advised,sru is on the scene.

262
00:12:49,027 --> 00:12:50,561
You're good.

263
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:13,092
Let's keep the peace.

264
00:13:20,948 --> 00:13:24,510
K9 and half the marine unit here.

265
00:13:25,378 --> 00:13:26,953
Copy,10-4.

266
00:13:26,968 --> 00:13:29,802
Lewis,I need you in the
truck,you're my secondary.

267
00:13:29,828 --> 00:13:30,833
You got it.

268
00:13:30,848 --> 00:13:32,070
Rolie?

269
00:13:32,097 --> 00:13:34,082
Southwest needs containment.

270
00:13:34,095 --> 00:13:36,192
Make sure the outer perimeter's
clear,I'll take the inner myself.

271
00:13:36,206 --> 00:13:36,800
Good.

272
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:38,810
Spike,wordy,you cover parker.

273
00:13:38,837 --> 00:13:40,000
Sierras?

274
00:13:40,015 --> 00:13:40,773
North building.

275
00:13:40,788 --> 00:13:41,530
Jules?

276
00:13:41,548 --> 00:13:42,091
East.

277
00:13:42,117 --> 00:13:43,591
All right,good. Keep a close eye.

278
00:13:43,608 --> 00:13:45,663
This guy doesn't look too happy.

279
00:13:59,835 --> 00:14:00,701
Inspector.

280
00:14:00,725 --> 00:14:02,010
It's all yours,sergeant.

281
00:14:02,025 --> 00:14:03,042
Guy got a name?

282
00:14:03,065 --> 00:14:04,530
No. He doesn't speak english.

283
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:05,580
What's he speak?

284
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:08,071
Mid-eastern european or
something,I don't know.

285
00:14:08,087 --> 00:14:09,843
Well,how long have you been here?

286
00:14:09,866 --> 00:14:11,773
I think it's yugoslavian. Croatian.

287
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:12,413
Do you speak it?

288
00:14:12,426 --> 00:14:12,971
No.

289
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:13,913
Where's the translator?

290
00:14:13,926 --> 00:14:14,842
Back there.

291
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:15,661
What's he speak?

292
00:14:15,676 --> 00:14:17,370
Russian.

293
00:14:18,406 --> 00:14:20,411
We need a croatian
translator,anyone you can got;

294
00:14:20,438 --> 00:14:22,283
and let me know when
doctor luria's en route.

295
00:14:22,308 --> 00:14:22,872
10-4.

296
00:14:22,898 --> 00:14:24,781
All right,now back your guys off.

297
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:29,390
I'm trying to de-escalate here and I don't want my
boys getting shot in the back by sympathetic fire.

298
00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:31,431
Let's move it out.

299
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,210
My name is greg.

300
00:14:37,248 --> 00:14:40,882
It's just a radio. I'm
going to put it down.

301
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:44,073
let's talk,okay? Just talk.

302
00:14:48,046 --> 00:14:53,041
8:46 A.M.,Sergeant gregory
parker begins negotiation.

303
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:02,022
- You mind the radio?
- No.

304
00:15:02,037 --> 00:15:06,902
I don't know the identity of the gunman
or his hostage at first york plaza.

305
00:15:06,918 --> 00:15:09,750
He's right outside the building
in a stand-off with police,

306
00:15:09,787 --> 00:15:13,051
- who are characterizing this as a very dangerous...
- can you turn that up?

307
00:15:13,067 --> 00:15:15,980
With one victim critically injured.

308
00:15:15,996 --> 00:15:18,882
- Police are advising people to stay away...
- you know where that is?

309
00:15:18,896 --> 00:15:21,500
Don't worry,we're not
going anywhere near there.

310
00:15:21,515 --> 00:15:24,043
Then let's take a detour.

311
00:15:29,655 --> 00:15:31,641
Sierras,switch on transponders
and go to channel one.

312
00:15:31,656 --> 00:15:32,990
Copy.

313
00:15:33,005 --> 00:15:38,933
Sierra two,north building: Eleven floors,elevator
to the tenth,two lefts,one right,staircase up.

314
00:15:38,945 --> 00:15:40,042
Roger that.

315
00:15:40,056 --> 00:15:42,721
Sierra one,east
building: Fifteen floors.

316
00:15:42,747 --> 00:15:45,090
Look for a fire escape.

317
00:15:51,447 --> 00:15:53,601
ten,please.

318
00:15:55,986 --> 00:15:57,852
thank you.

319
00:15:59,595 --> 00:16:00,533
Elevator?

320
00:16:00,555 --> 00:16:02,810
- Immobilized. We're in lockdown.
- Key?

321
00:16:02,825 --> 00:16:05,440
Steve,where's security contact
for the howswell building?

322
00:16:05,456 --> 00:16:07,640
Thanks anyway.

323
00:16:09,777 --> 00:16:13,201
Easy,easy,this is all
about finding a way home.

324
00:16:13,218 --> 00:16:15,160
We all want to go home.

325
00:16:15,178 --> 00:16:18,702
But first,you have to put the gun down.

326
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:20,461
Sierra one,what's your status?

327
00:16:20,476 --> 00:16:22,750
Elevator's locked,I'm on the stairs.

328
00:16:22,785 --> 00:16:25,241
Weather report?

329
00:16:26,016 --> 00:16:29,721
Wind's 11 knots north-northwest,but
the plaza's sheltered.

330
00:16:29,736 --> 00:16:33,081
Could be looking at some updraft.

331
00:16:56,535 --> 00:16:58,242
Sierra two,in position.

332
00:16:58,256 --> 00:17:00,443
Updraft is confirmed.

333
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,221
Lovely. What's my elevation?

334
00:17:10,528 --> 00:17:13,890
Yeah. Thanks. Keep us posted.

335
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:18,410
Elevation... 185 feet.

336
00:17:18,968 --> 00:17:21,043
- Hey,lewis.
- Morning,doc.

337
00:17:21,055 --> 00:17:24,951
8:52 A.M.,Forensic
psychologist on scene.

338
00:17:24,966 --> 00:17:26,222
Nothing on our guy yet.

339
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:29,482
The woman he shot,looks like
she probably won't make it.

340
00:17:29,495 --> 00:17:30,871
I'll tell the boss.

341
00:17:30,887 --> 00:17:33,750
Can I see the transcript?

342
00:17:38,546 --> 00:17:41,420
Unclear,unclear,unclear.

343
00:17:50,055 --> 00:17:55,701
We can work this out together,one
step at a time,do you understand me?

344
00:17:55,716 --> 00:17:58,692
Dispatch,what's going
on with my translator?

345
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:04,681
Sierra one,take a left
out of the stairwell.

346
00:18:06,498 --> 00:18:08,913
Go straight ahead.

347
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,522
right turn and you're there.

348
00:18:16,535 --> 00:18:18,440
What?

349
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:21,203
- Lew,how old are those plans?
- What's wrong?

350
00:18:21,605 --> 00:18:23,943
Renovations.

351
00:18:24,845 --> 00:18:26,171
Is luria on scene yet?

352
00:18:26,187 --> 00:18:28,800
- Good morning.
- Hey,doc,what're ya thinking?

353
00:18:28,815 --> 00:18:31,161
First impression: Not substance issues.

354
00:18:31,175 --> 00:18:32,692
He's in full-on tunnel vision.

355
00:18:32,705 --> 00:18:34,691
I'm thinking multiple stressors.

356
00:18:34,706 --> 00:18:36,593
Might help if we knew
what he was saying.

357
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,401
Dispatch,what's going
on with my translator?

358
00:18:38,415 --> 00:18:40,420
We got someone en route. Ten minutes.

359
00:18:40,435 --> 00:18:43,150
That's not good enough. Patch
him on the phone right now.

360
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:45,281
Sierra one,I have a
new location for you.

361
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:46,640
Okay,take me there.

362
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:50,330
It's a higher angle,full-value
crosswind richochet risk.

363
00:18:50,348 --> 00:18:51,780
Ed,what's your vantage?

364
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,493
I can make it work.

365
00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:54,913
It's all yours.

366
00:18:54,938 --> 00:18:57,563
- You copy that,lewis?
- Copy.

367
00:19:20,596 --> 00:19:22,411
Sierra one,in position.

368
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,970
Sarge,sierra one's
position was compromised.

369
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,400
Sierra two is now sierra one.

370
00:19:27,418 --> 00:19:29,910
Sierra one,talk to me.

371
00:19:29,926 --> 00:19:31,611
He's holding her close.

372
00:19:31,706 --> 00:19:33,663
How's the view?

373
00:19:33,677 --> 00:19:35,422
Cold zero.

374
00:19:35,437 --> 00:19:37,772
I've got the solution.

375
00:19:39,056 --> 00:19:39,841
Put the gun down.

376
00:19:39,857 --> 00:19:43,630
I'm on the scene right now at
first york plaza,in north square,

377
00:19:43,648 --> 00:19:47,141
and as you can see the
hostage situation is...

378
00:19:53,616 --> 00:19:56,432
sierra two,in position.

379
00:19:58,586 --> 00:20:01,432
Good vantage.

380
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:06,200
Big civilian presence,north wall.

381
00:20:07,428 --> 00:20:09,573
Sierra one looks good.

382
00:20:09,587 --> 00:20:12,501
Easy,mister happy.

383
00:20:14,956 --> 00:20:16,822
Do you know why we're all here?

384
00:20:16,846 --> 00:20:18,822
It's about helping you.

385
00:20:18,835 --> 00:20:21,181
Do you understand? Help.

386
00:20:21,196 --> 00:20:24,630
But first,you have to put the gun down.

387
00:20:24,647 --> 00:20:26,872
put the gun down!

388
00:20:27,676 --> 00:20:29,102
sierra one,you got a solution?

389
00:20:29,118 --> 00:20:30,490
I got the solution.

390
00:20:30,507 --> 00:20:31,872
Dispatch: Copy that.

391
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:36,123
give me "put the gun down." "Gun down."

392
00:20:36,138 --> 00:20:37,952
Ostavi pistolj.

393
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:40,593
Ostavi pistolj!

394
00:20:40,608 --> 00:20:43,202
Ostavi pistolj!

395
00:20:44,466 --> 00:20:46,332
give me... give me "we want to help."

396
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:49,341
Easy,mister happy.

397
00:20:49,356 --> 00:20:52,793
C'mon,stop bobbin'.

398
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:58,641
That's it. That's
better. You want to dance?

399
00:21:00,227 --> 00:21:03,930
We'll dance... together.

400
00:21:03,945 --> 00:21:06,972
Hocemo vam pomoci. Hocemo vam pomoci.

401
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:10,733
ostavi pistolj. Put the gun down.

402
00:21:11,775 --> 00:21:12,862
gimme "calm down."

403
00:21:12,888 --> 00:21:13,783
Smiri se.

404
00:21:13,797 --> 00:21:15,643
Smiri se. Smiri se.

405
00:21:15,655 --> 00:21:17,143
Sierras,switch channels.

406
00:21:17,155 --> 00:21:18,153
Switching channels.

407
00:21:18,168 --> 00:21:19,461
Sierra one,copy.

408
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:20,981
What's he saying?

409
00:21:20,998 --> 00:21:23,842
"I'll shoot her. Don't
make me shoot her."

410
00:21:24,245 --> 00:21:27,823
Keep it calm! Just keep it calm!

411
00:21:31,376 --> 00:21:33,732
sierra one. Sierra one.

412
00:21:33,746 --> 00:21:35,200
Sierra one,go ahead.

413
00:21:35,217 --> 00:21:37,271
- Scorpio.
- Copy.

414
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:44,912
come on,my friend,let
me have... this... dance.

415
00:21:45,517 --> 00:21:48,312
Sarge,we got a runner! Rolie,red wall!

416
00:21:48,326 --> 00:21:50,721
Parker: Hold fire,sierra
one. Hold fire,hold fire.

417
00:21:50,736 --> 00:21:51,833
Copy,holding fire.

418
00:21:51,847 --> 00:21:55,051
Tata! Tata!

419
00:21:57,236 --> 00:21:58,570
Tata!

420
00:21:59,345 --> 00:22:01,942
Don't move! Stop right
there! Stop,stop,stop!

421
00:22:01,957 --> 00:22:03,252
Tata!

422
00:22:03,265 --> 00:22:04,202
Easy,easy.

423
00:22:04,218 --> 00:22:07,013
Tata! Tata!

424
00:22:07,346 --> 00:22:09,092
Easy,easy!

425
00:22:09,107 --> 00:22:11,461
One step at a time,now. Tell us
what's "tata"? That's your dad?

426
00:22:11,476 --> 00:22:14,131
Is that your father?

427
00:22:16,498 --> 00:22:17,383
'kay,what do you got?

428
00:22:17,398 --> 00:22:19,572
Male youth,breached the perimeter.

429
00:22:22,827 --> 00:22:24,520
look at me. He's going to be fine,okay?

430
00:22:24,536 --> 00:22:25,553
But we need to talk to him.

431
00:22:25,567 --> 00:22:28,503
- Rolie,what's going on?
- It's the son. I got his son here.

432
00:22:32,758 --> 00:22:33,963
scorpio still a go?

433
00:22:33,987 --> 00:22:35,931
That's affirmative,if he re-escalates.

434
00:22:35,948 --> 00:22:38,661
We may have a tpi here,so let's
see if we can work this out.

435
00:22:38,675 --> 00:22:42,130
If he re-escalates,copy.
Still got the solution.

436
00:22:45,635 --> 00:22:48,960
you know what? We need your
help. We need your help,okay?

437
00:22:48,977 --> 00:22:52,081
No one's going to get hurt here,no one's
going to hurt him,but we need to talk to him.

438
00:22:52,106 --> 00:22:54,831
Can you tell him,no one's gonna hurt
him? 'Kay,no one's gonna hurt him.

439
00:22:58,485 --> 00:23:01,690
what's he saying? What's he saying?

440
00:23:01,706 --> 00:23:04,790
Hey,son,you've gotta
tell me what he's saying.

441
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:19,132
- Scorpio.
- Scorpio.

442
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:23,572
Runner!

443
00:23:23,586 --> 00:23:25,893
jules: Ed! The boy!

444
00:24:04,507 --> 00:24:07,451
Police,don't move!
Police,don't move! Don't move!

445
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:10,341
Police,don't move! Police,don't move!

446
00:24:25,655 --> 00:24:27,972
what did you do?

447
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,933
Why did you do that?!

448
00:25:36,277 --> 00:25:37,490
tape it up. It's now a crime scene.

449
00:25:37,508 --> 00:25:40,283
Nobody speaks to the subject officer.

450
00:25:40,298 --> 00:25:43,791
Constable,I need your
rifle and your kit.

451
00:25:47,717 --> 00:25:51,100
Now you're under investigation;
you know the drill.

452
00:25:52,525 --> 00:25:55,041
Whenever you're ready.

453
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:23,653
Now,you know you're
sequestered,there's no talking,okay?

454
00:27:23,697 --> 00:27:27,713
We needed to barricade the doors so
people couldn't come in and out,all right?

455
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:34,792
Greg. That went down fast.

456
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:38,411
Lewis has the transcripts in the truck.

457
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:42,503
- I want another staging area for that media; move it.
- Yes sir.

458
00:27:42,517 --> 00:27:44,130
- It was by the book,norm.
- Yeah?

459
00:27:44,146 --> 00:27:46,923
That'll be for special
investigations to decide.

460
00:27:46,936 --> 00:27:49,931
Well,thank you,stainton.
Ed? This was you?

461
00:27:49,948 --> 00:27:52,790
You know better than to talk
to subject officers,commander.

462
00:27:52,807 --> 00:27:54,400
Thank you,inspector.

463
00:27:54,415 --> 00:27:56,562
Good job,constable.

464
00:27:56,577 --> 00:27:59,723
Parker,let's go,siu's waiting.

465
00:28:07,558 --> 00:28:09,463
- How ya doin',eddie?
- Parker.

466
00:28:09,478 --> 00:28:14,521
You mind just plugging your earholes for a second
while I talk to my buddy here and ask how he's doing?

467
00:28:17,037 --> 00:28:20,331
- How ya doin'?
- I'm fine. Fine.

468
00:28:26,547 --> 00:28:30,073
hey,ed,it was a good job.

469
00:28:55,868 --> 00:28:57,723
Saw the whole thing.

470
00:28:57,738 --> 00:29:00,432
I'm sam. Sam braddock.

471
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:02,412
Good for you.

472
00:29:02,425 --> 00:29:05,492
Don't see lady snipers too
often. That's kinda sexy.

473
00:29:05,507 --> 00:29:10,080
What's that,a remmy 700?
Classic. Hard to top 1 moa.

474
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,730
I carry a vintage colt myself.

475
00:29:12,745 --> 00:29:16,231
- Pearl grips,you want to see?
- Put your hands where I can see them! put your hands in the air!

476
00:29:16,248 --> 00:29:18,092
Lower your weapons!

477
00:29:18,107 --> 00:29:20,363
Lower your weapons!

478
00:29:20,377 --> 00:29:24,823
Easy! That's my dad. Pearl grips.

479
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,290
Braddock,your instructions
were to report to the station.

480
00:29:28,307 --> 00:29:31,520
Sorry,sir,I heard it on the
radio,I didn't want to miss it.

481
00:29:31,538 --> 00:29:34,562
Good work,team one. Team
three will relieve you.

482
00:29:34,578 --> 00:29:37,892
Siu needs witness statements
then see dr. Luria for a debrief.

483
00:29:37,907 --> 00:29:41,333
Braddock,come with me.

484
00:29:43,426 --> 00:29:46,790
Nice post-incident reflexes,guys.

485
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:28,582
In the hostage taking that shook the downtown
core,police confirm the hostage is unharmed,

486
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,250
but is obviously shaken.

487
00:30:30,285 --> 00:30:32,740
According to reports,the gunman...

488
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:38,580
blair kowalski,special
investigations unit. How you doin'?

489
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:42,691
Okay,let's start with the
vest. I need your vest.

490
00:30:45,268 --> 00:30:47,440
Vest.

491
00:30:50,487 --> 00:30:52,761
Shirt.

492
00:30:53,987 --> 00:30:56,422
Boots.

493
00:30:59,245 --> 00:31:01,600
pants.

494
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:21,482
You didn't wait.

495
00:31:21,495 --> 00:31:23,492
Just bagging the clothes.

496
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:25,721
They say debriefing and
you take it literally?

497
00:31:25,746 --> 00:31:26,853
Did you say anything?

498
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:28,402
You don't have to say anything to him.

499
00:31:28,418 --> 00:31:29,821
That's your right,okay?

500
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:31,430
Frank mcandrew,I'm
your lawyer,all right?

501
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:34,630
I'm gonna take care of all this. You
have nothing to worry about,all right?

502
00:31:34,647 --> 00:31:37,733
Saw it on tv,that was great work.

503
00:31:38,047 --> 00:31:40,792
Kowalski,this is a no-brainer.

504
00:31:40,827 --> 00:31:42,823
No pun intended.

505
00:31:42,835 --> 00:31:45,360
Do you wanna talk to him now or what?

506
00:31:45,745 --> 00:31:47,450
Okay.

507
00:31:48,486 --> 00:31:50,751
What exactly do you
mean,"he called scorpio"?

508
00:31:50,768 --> 00:31:52,900
He means he got the order.

509
00:31:52,935 --> 00:31:55,740
When you say you "got the order"...

510
00:31:58,145 --> 00:31:59,363
you gonna get that?

511
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,462
It's okay,it's my wife.

512
00:32:00,478 --> 00:32:02,392
You can get that. If you
want to get it,you can get it.

513
00:32:02,408 --> 00:32:05,100
It's your right to talk to your wife.

514
00:32:06,686 --> 00:32:08,380
Hey,soph.

515
00:32:08,395 --> 00:32:09,860
Nah,I can't talk.

516
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:13,460
Okay,I just wanted to know if that
was that your team this morning?

517
00:32:13,517 --> 00:32:14,771
Yeah.

518
00:32:14,788 --> 00:32:16,931
That was you?

519
00:32:16,966 --> 00:32:18,763
Yeah.

520
00:32:20,498 --> 00:32:22,821
Well,ah,we'll go home
and wait for you there.

521
00:32:22,837 --> 00:32:27,583
No,no,no,just... you know
what? Just go to the thing,okay?

522
00:32:28,815 --> 00:32:31,891
Okay,eddie. Bye.

523
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:38,313
- So,picking up,when you say you
"got- - You saw it,didn't you?

524
00:32:38,325 --> 00:32:40,472
Just give him the use of
force wheel. This is textbook.

525
00:32:40,488 --> 00:32:43,083
Just,uh,just show him. Give it to him.

526
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:46,311
When all reasonable efforts to
de-escalate the situation fail

527
00:32:46,325 --> 00:32:49,321
and the suspect is threatening
a member of the force,

528
00:32:49,347 --> 00:32:52,681
clearly progressing from "assaultive"
to "grievous bodily harm",

529
00:32:52,715 --> 00:32:54,340
okay,there we have it! Okay?

530
00:32:54,357 --> 00:32:56,573
- Are we done here,mr. Kowalski?
- Just about.

531
00:32:56,587 --> 00:32:59,441
Were you aware that the
suspect's son was at the scene?

532
00:32:59,455 --> 00:33:02,281
My observer said there
was a,uh,male youth.

533
00:33:02,297 --> 00:33:07,933
And do you believe that every effort was made to involve
the son in the negotiation as a third party intermediary?

534
00:33:07,956 --> 00:33:09,872
Yes I do.

535
00:33:09,885 --> 00:33:14,263
And are you confident that all options were
exhausted before the use of lethal force?

536
00:33:14,286 --> 00:33:18,121
What,the option of watching
him shoot my teammate?

537
00:33:18,775 --> 00:33:21,553
I'll put that as a yes.

538
00:33:21,976 --> 00:33:24,820
So you know,this is the process:

539
00:33:24,846 --> 00:33:27,870
We investigate alongside
the coroner's inquest

540
00:33:27,887 --> 00:33:30,903
and our director will
deliver his statement as to

541
00:33:30,918 --> 00:33:32,703
whether or not there are
reasonable grounds to believe

542
00:33:32,715 --> 00:33:35,640
that you or the other subject
officer used excessive force.

543
00:33:35,656 --> 00:33:36,751
He knows the process.

544
00:33:36,796 --> 00:33:38,971
Until that time,you're
under investigation.

545
00:33:38,997 --> 00:33:43,611
We recommend you take a break,spend
some quality time with the family.

546
00:33:43,648 --> 00:33:47,062
- Thank you,blair.
- Good.

547
00:33:47,377 --> 00:33:49,621
I'll see you at the inquest.

548
00:33:50,266 --> 00:33:52,352
Hold on,ed.

549
00:33:52,668 --> 00:33:55,461
There's somebody else
that you gotta talk to.

550
00:34:16,678 --> 00:34:18,761
hey,mom.

551
00:34:28,405 --> 00:34:31,501
- Look...
- I know,you're fine.

552
00:34:32,107 --> 00:34:35,713
You did a great job out there,but
you need somebody to talk to.

553
00:34:35,738 --> 00:34:38,522
It's strictly confidential.

554
00:34:40,156 --> 00:34:43,360
doc,if you want a date,just ask.

555
00:34:44,287 --> 00:34:46,960
oh,you know what? Screw it.

556
00:34:46,976 --> 00:34:50,262
I forgot who I was
talking to,for a minute.

557
00:34:50,276 --> 00:34:52,112
you're not that guy.

558
00:34:52,128 --> 00:34:54,351
You're not gonna wonder
if you did the right thing.

559
00:34:54,365 --> 00:34:58,783
You're not going to have any sleepless
nights,flashbacks,memory loss,time distortions.

560
00:34:58,795 --> 00:35:01,993
You're not gonna...
feel alone,feel guilty.

561
00:35:02,008 --> 00:35:04,542
Feel guilty about not feeling guilty.

562
00:35:04,558 --> 00:35:08,552
that's what happens to
other people,you'll be fine.

563
00:35:10,187 --> 00:35:13,862
You know where to find me.
Not that you'll need to.

564
00:35:48,316 --> 00:35:50,863
ed,it's time.

565
00:36:02,268 --> 00:36:04,913
Code of silence been lifted?

566
00:36:05,277 --> 00:36:07,532
- Yeah.
- So how'd it go?

567
00:36:08,135 --> 00:36:10,773
- The way they do.
- Are you good?

568
00:36:10,975 --> 00:36:12,830
- Yup.
- Yeah?

569
00:36:13,316 --> 00:36:15,913
Piece of gum? Minty fresh.

570
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:18,262
Listen,I saw you up there.

571
00:36:18,805 --> 00:36:21,080
It was a clean shot.

572
00:36:21,656 --> 00:36:22,920
Yeah,it was.

573
00:36:22,937 --> 00:36:25,760
That guy knew what he was
in for. You saved lives.

574
00:36:25,776 --> 00:36:26,350
What I'd tell ya?

575
00:36:26,368 --> 00:36:29,161
- Making the world safe so that others may eat pie.
- Eat pie.

576
00:36:29,175 --> 00:36:30,111
That's right.

577
00:36:30,128 --> 00:36:33,691
Let's hope the stockholm
syndrome kicks finast.

578
00:36:33,706 --> 00:36:35,951
Mr. Lane.

579
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:39,650
You better have an outstanding
reason for being late.

580
00:36:44,718 --> 00:36:46,513
Good job,son.

581
00:36:46,525 --> 00:36:48,563
And I am done.

582
00:36:48,577 --> 00:36:50,513
As you were.

583
00:36:59,607 --> 00:37:01,961
So we're gonna try this again.

584
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:04,683
Uh,team one,this is sam braddock.

585
00:37:04,696 --> 00:37:06,103
Sam's gonna be joining you.

586
00:37:06,117 --> 00:37:09,072
Sam took his babysteps at 51st division.

587
00:37:09,087 --> 00:37:12,750
Went army and joins
us straight from jtf 2.

588
00:37:12,765 --> 00:37:15,980
This is greg parker,he's
the team sergeant.

589
00:37:15,995 --> 00:37:22,301
We've got rolie,lewis,wordy,spike,jules
and ed lane as our team leader.

590
00:37:22,315 --> 00:37:24,373
- Nice shot.
- Thanks.

591
00:37:24,385 --> 00:37:27,511
- Team's full,isn't it?
- Actually,it's not.

592
00:37:27,526 --> 00:37:29,953
Rolie,your application's been approved.

593
00:37:29,965 --> 00:37:33,361
You are fast-tracked for sergeant.

594
00:37:37,768 --> 00:37:40,180
- On me.
- Thanks,man.

595
00:37:40,196 --> 00:37:42,123
You guys earned it.

596
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:44,793
Thank you,sir.

597
00:37:44,806 --> 00:37:47,342
- Well,it's about time.

598
00:37:47,355 --> 00:37:49,040
- Congrats,man.

599
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,052

gonna live without you,huh?

600
00:37:51,067 --> 00:37:54,803
- Aw,he'll be a lost man,I reckon.
- Yeah.

601
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:59,392
- So,jules,that short for julia?
- No.

602
00:38:00,816 --> 00:38:06,573
Elite special ops counter-terrorist guy leaves
it all behind for the glamour of urban policing.

603
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:08,852
What's up with that?

604
00:38:08,865 --> 00:38:13,233
So,sam,how many al-qaeda
guys you take out?

605
00:38:14,005 --> 00:38:16,133
What,you mean like to dinner?

606
00:38:17,637 --> 00:38:20,913
You gotta be wasted to take
seven tases like that,right?

607
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:22,453
- I could take seven.
- Seven,what?

608
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:26,470
- I could take seven tasers.
- you couldn't take seven tasers.

609
00:38:53,506 --> 00:38:55,830
You and parker island,right?

610
00:38:56,306 --> 00:38:57,813
What happened in there?

611
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:03,482
I probably got tased seven times.

612
00:39:04,057 --> 00:39:06,860
You know,everybody's on the same page.

613
00:39:07,397 --> 00:39:10,213
what? What does that mean?

614
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:29,480
I'm fine.

615
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:35,863
you may want to do the math,one
day,on all the "I'm fines".

616
00:39:51,775 --> 00:39:56,282
* and I will watch you disappear *

617
00:39:56,787 --> 00:40:01,650

623
00:40:33,908 --> 00:40:38,682

624

* from the harsh light of your day *

625
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:48,020
* and I have slept
through pouring rain *

626
