1
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:09,730
what's happening,man?I can't see you.

2
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,190
I'm working on it.

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,650
Don't play with me,man.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,540
Justin: Look,what do you want?

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,480
I am going as fast as
I can,so let me do this!

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,960
********

7
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,310
you tickle me,I will leave you.

8
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,070
what makes you think I'd
do something like that?

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,190
Hey,listen.I have a idea.

10
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,530
How about we switch,okay?

11
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:05,560
I want three naps,nine hot meals,bubble baths and back
massages every day while you go out and slave on double shifts.

12
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,850
Hey,I'm working my butt off here.

13
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,550
Yeah?

14
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,860
How you feeling?

15
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,550
Like a punching bag.

16
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,130
feel that?

17
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,340
Yes.

18
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,780
Listen,I have a surprise for you.

19
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,520
Gee.My cell phone.

20
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:35,620
Yes,except now it has a direct link to
this one,which I'm gonna put in the nursery.

21
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,600
free baby monitor.

22
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,530
- Is that legal?
- Yeah... yeah.

23
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,750
I just... I-I gave the
phone a dynamic ip,right?

24
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,140
And then I set up our home
system to work as a remote C...

25
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,540
-  yeah,yeah,yeah.
- Oh,you don't care,okay.

26
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,240
Thank you.

27
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,200
Have I ever told you
how much I love you?

28
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,570
No,I don't think so.

29
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:01,590
Well,you're gonna have to remind
me to get around to that someday.

30
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,860
who is it?

31
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,430
Mike.

32
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,290
Hey,mike.What's going on?

33
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,420
Mike: Jus,I need to
talk to you.It's serious.

34
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,310
It's actually a really
bad time right now,mike.

35
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,330
I'm headed to work.I've
got an afternoon shift.

36
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,420
Please,man.

37
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,230
I'm serious,mike.I'm getting
into my car right now.

38
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,960
No,you're not.

39
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,360
Hang on.

40
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,920
- Justin...
- I know.

41
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,640
What am I gonna do?

42
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,400
It's mike.

43
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,990
I'll see you tonight.

44
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,800
ladies!

45
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,270
Donn Look at that.How was your weekend?

46
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,680
It was great,but I
missed your smiling faces.

47
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,090
Two milks?

48
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,350
Yes,thank you.

49
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,920
- Winnie,black?
- Thank you.

50
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,090
All right,sam,ice-cap.

51
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,250
- Cheers,boss.- How
was your soul-searching?

52
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,010
- Good,thanks.
- Oh,yeah? You find one?

53
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,790
Thank you.

54
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,590
All right.Ed?Wordy?

55
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,790
In the lockers,I think.

56
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,470
Hey,where's my double double?

57
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,250
Look who's dropped in.

58
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,500
How are you?

59
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,970
How are you?

60
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,640
Donna,jules,jules,donna.

61
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,070
- Hi,donna.
- Hoare you?

62
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,210
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

63
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,180
How you feeling?

64
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,470
100%.How about you?

65
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,590
150.

66
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,360
- Oh,come on.
- Come on,let's walk.

67
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,630
ooh,make a muscle.

68
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,240
Oh,that's nice!

69
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,750
I'll take these to ed and wordy.

70
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,680
Uh,no.It's okay.I'll do it.

71
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,690
- $20,000?
- I can put something together.

72
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,490
I can sell some stuff.It
wouldn't be an issue.

73
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,590
Mike,there's no way.

74
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,810
I don't have that kind of money.

75
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,910
I know,I know,I know.

76
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,690
I just figured,you know,you work at the
bank,maybe you could transfer some money.

77
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,470
Maybe I could what,mike?

78
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,150
What do you think could
do?I'm a button pusher.

79
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,510
I don't authorize loans
to gambling addicts.

80
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,860
Yeah,well,then maybe you
can push the right buttons.

81
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,020
Oh,I don't believe this.

82
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,190
It's temporary,jus.

83
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,960
It's gonna take a couple of days.

84
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,350
You know,we don't hear from you in six months,and we
think,you know,thank god,he's finally got his act together.

85
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,140
I ow.I know.I know.

86
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,790
I wouldn't be coming to you
unless I was desperate,okay?

87
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,820
Who are these guys,mike?

88
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,350
I don't know.I don't know.

89
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,080
They just showed up.

90
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,290
I've never seen them before.

91
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,820
All of a sudden,the ten
grand that I owe is now 20.

92
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,010
and I'm scared,man.

93
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,490
Justin,I'm scared.

94
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,610
I can't do this.

95
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,800
- It's numbers,man.
- This is too much.

96
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,990
It's not legal.

97
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,100
- You're all that I have.You don't do this...
- mike,come on.

98
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:02,910
If you do not do this,and then this
time tomorrow,they're gonna take me out.

99
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,660
Is that what you want?

100
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,520
Is that what you want?!

101
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:15,870
Justin,these guys...
these guys are crazy,man.

102
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,390
You still have that bravelink
account I set up for you,right?

103
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,910
Write down your account number and pin.

104
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,990
I can get into the
system and make a deposit.

105
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,870
I'll bypass the atm withdrawal limit.

106
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,080
I knew you'd think of something,man.

107
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,360
Mike,this is not free money,okay?

108
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,900
Anything you take
out,you have to put back.

109
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,370
Trust me,okay?

110
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,420
Mike?

111
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,910
This is the last time.

112
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,010
Okay,go.I'll call you when it's done.

113
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,130
ginger.

114
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,120
That should help.

115
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,110
Maya.With the morning sickness.

116
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,970
There's ginger tea and a peppermint rub.

117
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,580
Thanks,brenda.I'm sure
she'll appreciate it.

118
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,130
You okay,kiddo?

119
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:00,350
'Cause this stuff'll help you,too,if
you're freaked out about the little one.

120
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,090
No,no.I'm good,thanks.

121
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,680
Bren,I'm-I'M...
really,thank you very much.

122
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,190
it's in your account.

123
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,900
U up for a high school
career show-and-tell?

124
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,980
Yeah.

125
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,490
I'm thinking about
sending jules with you.

126
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,090
What,you think she's ready?

127
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,160
Well,she passed her re-qualifying
tests with a perfect score.

128
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,010
So her and sam on the same team?

129
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,930
Talked to both of them,thing's over.

130
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,360
It's not that simple.

131
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,630
They're professionals.

132
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,300
What about donna?

133
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,140
A team is seven.I got to make a choice.

134
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,430
Stin?

135
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,150
Some guy out at customer service
says he really needs to see you.

136
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,750
What the hell are you doing here,mike?

137
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,530
Jus,there's a change of plan.

138
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,940
- What?
- They want more.

139
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,990
$500,000 into this account.

140
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,240
Oh,are you crazy,mike?I can't do that.

141
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,110
Jus,don't panic and stay calm.

142
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,120
Okay?

143
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,220
I was just sent this.

144
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,700
Justin,please.

145
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,050
They want their money by 6:00.

146
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,680
But they say they'll... they'll
kill me if you don't do it.

147
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,050
One hour,then she dies.

148
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,960
Oh,my god.

149
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,340
Maya.How?

150
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,090
They must have followed
meo your place,okay?

151
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,880
Jus,I'm sorry.I'm so sorry.

152
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,470
We have to calthe cops.

153
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,700
You do that... you do
that,and they'll kill her.

154
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,740
You just need to send the
money,and they're gonna let her go.

155
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,310
It's not that easy!

156
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,750
You already did it once,right?

157
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,420
So you can do it again.

158
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,210
It's too late.

159
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,900
They tripped the alarm.They
tripped the alarm.

160
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,570
Cops are on the way.

161
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,240
Okay,we hok,ave to keep
them from coming in.

162
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,820
You need to keep them
out until you're done.

163
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,510
That's the only choice we
have.That's the only choice we have.

164
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,600
Everyone down!Everybody
down on the gr ind.

165
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,080

Do it now!

167
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,510
He's got a gun.

168
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,250
Close the blinds!

169
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,030

Okay.Upstairs empty?

183
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,940
We cleared the building just in case.

184
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,880
Access is through a
fire door in the alley.

185
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,300
Okay,thanks.Keep it containe

186
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:02,880
How's it look,eddie?

187
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,980
No sierra shot.

188
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,210
The front do is too exposed.

189
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,560
We're going to go in through the back.

190
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,420
It's a strange place
to hit,internet bank.

191
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,410
No cash.

192
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,310
Yeah,this guy's an
amateur.Hasn't done his homework.

193
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,650
Or he never expected to
carry anything out with him.

194
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,260
Right.Lewis,I need the building plans.

195
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,570
- Copy that.
- Okay,spike,let's get eyes inside.

196
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,630
See what's going on
behind those curtains.

197
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,270
Spike: Copy that.

198
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,820
What the hell are you
doing with gun,mike?

199
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,710
I borrowed it,friend of a friend.

200
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,890
Told you they were serious.

201
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,640
Mike,who are these people?

202
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,520
Look... look,we're on camera.

203
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:49,530
You look like a hostage,okay?

204
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,690
You let me take the blame for this.

205
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,160
It'll probably work out okay.

206
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,390
This is crazy.

207
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,130
When you have hostages,when you have
hostages,they give you some space.

208
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,810
Okay?

209
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,680
You have time to do your thing.

210
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,200
Two minutes,we're done.

211
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,890
Maya's safe.Come on.

212
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,270
No,no,no,no,no,listen.

213
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,160
- We talk to the cops...
- "we talk to the cops"?

214
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,100
Tell them what?

215
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,700
I don't know who these guys are.

216
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,930
And I don't know where they took her.

217
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,140
Now,you heard what they said.

218
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:22,080
If they don't get the
money by 6:00,maya dies.

219
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,170
pick it up!

220
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,840
Hey,this is sergeant gregory parker.

221
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,140
I'm with the police
strategic response unit.

222
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,760
Who am I speaking to?

223
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:47,780
This is,um... this is mike mckewon.

224
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,270
And I'm in this alone.

225
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,590
First contact with subject,5:17 P.M.

226
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,770
A bank robber who gives up his name?

227
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,580
Run it.

228
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,490
And see if he's got a cell phone.

229
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,310
Well,mike,just want you to
know that I'm here to help you.

230
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,920
But first,I need to know
that everyone in there's okay.

231
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,950
Everyone's fine.

232
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,400
And they'll stay that way as
long as you keep your distance.

233
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,450
- Okay,mike,but first...
- yeah,you just stay out.

234
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,430
You stay out and nobody gets hurts.

235
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,570
All right,mike,just stay
on the phone with me...

236
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,670
hey,eddie,you hear that?

237
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,020
Yeah,he wants time.

238
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,760
Yeah,but for what?

239
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,420
What do you got,buddy?

240
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,660
We're going to go in through the back.

241
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,700
Sam and wordy are going to enter the
fire exit and extract the hostages.

242
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,220
Donna and I are going to go
down the central staircase.

243
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,650
Okay,that sounds good.

244
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,830
Spike,we need eyes in.Come on.

245
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,450
Security system's got extra firewalls.

246
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,650
It's hard to get access
from outside the building.

247
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,360
Downloading the codes now,eyes in five.

248
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,590
What?Wh-what's wrong?

249
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:52,200
- The system's locked me out.
- Uh,bypass it.

250
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,160
I've tried.I've tried.It's
completely shut down.

251
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,070
Mr.Aguinaldo,you got to help me.

252
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,040
Please.

253
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,340
Look,don't make me hurt your friend.

254
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,750
I can't help you.

255
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,430
Network shuts down
when the alarm goes off.

256
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,030
Security protocol in case this happens.

257
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,480
No transfers in or out.

258
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:15,110
Okay,well,what about the,the
override codes to reboot the system?

259
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,350
- I don't have those.
-Then whohuoes?!

260
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,890
You?!

261
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,530
You got them?!

262
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,060
How about you?!

263
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,740
What about you?

264
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,370
- Take it easy,all ght?
- They don't have them.

265
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,230
T-tenth floor.

266
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,280
Only the execs have the
codes on the tenth floor.

267
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,400
yeah?

268
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,750
Looks like you're done.

269
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,250
No,everything's under control.

270
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,000
We just had a little setback.

271
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,940
I see the setback.It's all over my tv.

272
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,640
It's over.

273
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,520
We're going to cut our losses.

274
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,750
what do you mean,"it's over"?

275
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,910
- It's not... - no!No!
No-no-no,no!Please! Please!

276
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,860
Listen!You'll get your money,okay?

277
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,000
You said 6:00.

278
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,560
That was before you had
cops all over your ass.

279
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,640
I will get it to you!

280
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,120
I just need some time.

281
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,600
Time to talk to the cops.

282
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,870

won'T.

283
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,690

284
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,610
Um,do you hmpe a couter?

285
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,520
- Yeah.
- Okay,I'm going to send you a web address.

286
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,130
Okay,please,give me two minutes.

287
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,600
You can watch everything from
there.I'll call you right back.

288
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,010
What's going on?

289
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,130
I got to buy some trust.

290
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,210
I'll be back.

291
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,140
Nobody move.

292
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,250
Mike mckewon.He's our
guy.He's got a record.

293
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,180
mostly petty stuff.

294
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,110
Nothing violent: B&es,possession
with intent to sell,credit card fraud.

295
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,230
Guy's all over the map.

296
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,460
One thing in common,though: Fast cash.

297
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,000
So you think we're
dealing with an addict?

298
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,750
Well,scores every few months.

299
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:59,430
He's feeding some kind of habit
or he's paying off some loans.

300
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,930
Spike,come on.

301
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,610
Show starts in three,two...

302
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,180
What's he doing?

303
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,970
You seeing this eddie?

304
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,090
Yeah.

305
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,350
Looks like our guy's
letting his guard down.

306
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,830
Or waiting for something.

307
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,840
Won't be waiting long.

308
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,960
We're going in.

309
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,270
Yes!

310
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,180
You got it?

311
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,810
Yeah,I got it.

312
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:43,030
Okay,I've tapped you into the
cctv so you can see everything now.

313
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,300
We start talking to the
cops,you will know it.

314
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,020
Okay.

315
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,520
so I'll watch it with your girl here.

316
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,420
You make sure you keep your promise.

317
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,880
Hey,you got a problem.

318
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:21,570
Justin: Damn
it.Okay,okay... okay,okay...

319
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,800
I'll take care of it,all
right?Just don't hurt her,please?

320
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,320
Hostages are in range.

321
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,820
Preparing distraction.

322
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,820
On your go,eddie.

323
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,270
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

324
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,050
Don't come any closer!

325
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,820
Okay,mike?

326
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,760
Let's just take this slow.

327
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,510
I said don't come any
closer or I shoot him!

328
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,320
Please!

329
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,380
He'll do it!

330
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,050
Jus,they've got our hostages.

331
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,920
You've got me,so just... keep cool.

332
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,130
Yeah.

333
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,790
Calmly and quickly leave the building.

334
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,930
Keep your heads down.

335
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,550
There's no way out,jus.

336
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,810
I'm going to jail.They got
guys on the inside.I'm dead,man.

337
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,830
This is not about
you.This is about maya.

338
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,240
There's no way out.

339
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,620
We need police protection.

340
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,840
We've got to talk.

341
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,120
Maya... they're watcng.

342
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,870
Okay,mike,we all want this to end
peacefully,so just put down the gun.

343
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:36,510
All right,just put it down,and we can
all... we can all walk out of here.

344
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,880
It's not looking good for you.

345
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,970
Hector?

346
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,200
It's time to send a message.

347
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,650

348
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,320
mike... they're watching.

349
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,020
There's no way out.

350
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,770
Jus,we're done.We're done.We're done.

351
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,560
don't worry,buddy.

352
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:35,060
Justin... please!

353
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,140
Don't let mike give up!

354
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,790
They say they'll hurt me and the baby.

355
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,200
it's not over!

356
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,990
Justin...

357
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,210
Stage has the weapon.

358
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,640
Repeat,hostage has the weapon.

359
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,620
- Damn it.
- Back off!

360
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,850
And don't interfere!

361
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,160
No solution.

362
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,900
This is not over!

363
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,750
Obstruction.No solution.

364
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,620
Talk to me,boss.

365
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,180
Team one,stand down.

366
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,710
Fall back. Fall back.

367
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,400
Copy that.

368
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,270
What's going on?

369
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,830
You know something we don't?

370
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,720
Yeah,they're not the threat,eddie.

371
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,040
We've just intercepted
that cell phone call.

372
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,240
Go ahead,lou.

373
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,020
Justin,please.

374
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,120
Don't let mike give up!

375
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,910
They say they'll hurt me and the baby.

376
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,070
Man,that was crazy.

377
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,730
You son of a bitch!You
were going to give up!

378
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,480
What are you talking about?

379
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,650
You got us into this and
you were just going to bail?!

380
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,230
- Jus...
- they're going to kill maya and the baby.

381
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,780
What do you mean "baby"?

382
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:51,840
- What baby?!
- What baby?Maya's pregnant?

383
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:56,750
How could you do this to me,mike?

384
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,930
- Jus,I...
- how could you possibly do this to me?!

385
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,540
I didn't know,jus.I'm
sorry,okay?Justin,I'm sorry!

386
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,820
You're always sorry!

387
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:06,240
And you always call me  to bail you out!

388
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,320
Yeah,I do.

389
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,670
I make mistakes,okay?

390
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,280
I know I do.

391
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,030
I make lots of mistakes!I know!

392
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,950
I'm sorry I didn't have the luck to be
born like you with the luck that you have!

393
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,480
What else do you want me to say?

394
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,490
The next time you screw
up,call someone else.

395
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,510
There is no one else.

396
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,460
You know that.

397
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:49,670
Let's,uh... let's just
get the codes and do this.

398
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:56,150
So anything you can come up with would be really helpful.

399
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,830
Did they seem to be familiar with one another?

400
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:01,740
5:33 P.M.12 hostages secured.To subjects still armed and active.

401
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:06,640
A mike mckewon and an employee identified by his manager-- justin fraser.

402
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:16,430
Justin,please... don't let mike give up!

403
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:21,680
-This is livideo nk they just sent justin.
-They said they'd hurt me and the baby.

404
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,370
okay,new deal,ed.

405
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,040
These guys are acting under duress.

406
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,140
Someone's holding the employee's wife.

407
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,860
Colleagues say she's seven months pregnant.

408
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,430
It also sounds like they seem to know each other,boss.

409
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,060
If they know each other,what's their connection?

410
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,440
Lewis,did you track the source?

411
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,430
Yeah,prepaid cell,no gps.

412
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:45,560
Manager said they were trying to wire money into an offshore account,but they didn't have the right codes.

413
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,020
They still think they can do it.

414
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,470
And that's why they won't give up.

415
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:51,380
If someone had sophie,would you?

416
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,360
Winnie,mike mckewon and justin fraser.

417
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,280
We need a connection.See who could be pulling their strings and from where asap.

418
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,490
Copy.

419
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,630
Boss,whoever it is,I think they're watching.

420
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,970
That's what justin was doing.

421
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:05,730
He uplinked the security system to an ftp.

422
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:08,640
If you give someone the web address they can see what we see.

423
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,810
The guy's pretty good.

424
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:12,070
Want me to interrupt the feed,block the bad guy's view?

425
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,990
Negative.

426
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:16,110
Ed,this is why justin told us not to interfere.

427
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:20,250
The kidnapper will keep the wife alive as long as he thinks he'll still get his money.

428
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,410
I want to believe the wife's still alive.

429
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,700
And we can use this to our advantage.

430
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,830
So we keep them in the game till we figure out where they are?

431
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,800
-Yeah.
-All right.

432
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:38,080
Sarge,uniforms confirm no sign of maya fraser at the house.

433
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,840
And they report signs of forced entry.

434
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,750
Thanks,winnie.

435
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,610
I got a hit on your guy justin fraser.

436
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,620
-In crimal record?
-No,family services.

437
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,580
Go ahead.

438
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,610
Okay,both parents deceased.Looks like he was 13.

439
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:51,060
He was transferred to the custody of a jack fraser.

440
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,130
Uncle,in brampton.

441
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,700
Okay,let's get ahold of the uncle.

442
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,540
See if he can tell us what justin's got himself involved in.

443
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,610
You got it.

444
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:00,570
So how are you going to find these codes we need?

445
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,570
The override codes change every few weeks,so the execs have go w toherite tm down somewhere.

446
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,820
Mike: What are we looking for?

447
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,460
It's,uh,it's usually something personal.

448
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,540
Like A... like a birthda or a cat?

449
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,460
Justin's a good kid.

450
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,560
Smart.

451
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,830
My brother's son.He came to live with me after he lost his parents.

452
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,970
So what happened to the parents?

453
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,130
Uh... car accident.

454
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:37,180
As far as you know,justin isn't involved in illegal activities?

455
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:41,500
Well,he studied his butt off to get where he is,maya's expecting--

456
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,280
no,I... I don't see him throwing that away.

457
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,370
Well,are they okay?

458
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,690
What do you know about mike mckewon?

459
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,150
Oh,so this is about mike.

460
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,140
No.

461
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,900
Look,I had three kids of my own,okay?

462
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,130
I couldn't take them both.

463
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,990
Besides,he was 17.He was old enough to be on his own.

464
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,750
So you're saying justin and mike are brothers?

465
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,810
No,no,half.

466
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:06,340
His mom remarried my brother when mike was two or three.

467
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,070
Then they had justin.

468
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,160
But the kid's always been trouble.

469
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,400
Not even my brother could handle him.There was no way I could take that on.

470
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:18,150
So after the accident,justin got a home,and mike was left to look out for himself?

471
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,980
Yeah.

472
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,610
Are you in?

473
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,000
yeah.

474
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,470
How'd you know the name of the cat?

475
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,760
I didn'T.

476
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,040
The password is on the back.

477
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,070
*******

478
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:34,430
okay,all right,it's scanning the system for the codes now.

479
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:40,010
Once we get them,we take them down to the secure servers in the basement,input them,send the cash.

480
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,860
Then they let maya go.

481
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,010
How long has maya been pregnant?

482
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:50,890
Seven months.

483
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:55,020
You got a boy or a girl?

484
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,790
We don't know,mike.We were going to wait.

485
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:02,200
I'm sorry.

486
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:08,490
I've been working on the video attachment for mike's phone.

487
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:12,190
Justin... please.

488
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:16,470
They want their money by 6:00 or they say they'll... they'll kill me.

489
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,230
you hear that?Sirens.

490
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,260
Sounds like a cruiser.

491
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,430
-They want their money by 6:00... 
-and an ambulance.

492
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:25,400
-...Or they say they'll kill... 
-the message was sent at 5:01 P.M.

493
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,630
I got winnie to send me the info on all cruiser and ambulance calls at 5:01.

494
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,290
Three cruisers,one ambulance.

495
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,420
Say she's downtown.

496
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:35,480
She could either be here,here or here-- wellington and john.

497
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,650
-Club district.
-Exactly.

498
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:39,250
-Nice work,spike.
-And here,there's more.

499
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:42,320
We've got a corner of a window.

500
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,970
Arched window,stained glas it could be a church.

501
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,230
No,not at wellington and john.

502
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,180
No,no,no,that's the viper-- a night club.

503
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,570
I did a drug case in there.

504
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:50,870
You sure about this?

505
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:53,780
Yeah,that makes sense.I mean,most of the ubs in that area are hot with drug traffic.

506
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,070
Mostly gang controlled.

507
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,650
A gang would have what it takes to pull this off?

508
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,640
That is the viper.I know the windows.

509
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,610
Club's five minutes from here.

510
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:03,750
Okay,winnie,let's deploy team four to viper nightclub.

511
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:06,880
No,sorry.Team four was dispatched 20 minutes ago,sarge.

512
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,340
Domestic gun call in rexdale.

513
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,960
I'll put team three on standby.

514
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,130
It'll take them at least half an hour just to deploy.

515
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,850
All right,we can be there in five.

516
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:15,970
Our hands are tied here.Besides,the threat's at the club.

517
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:18,400
Okay,you go.Lou,spike and I will alpha here.

518
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,590
Lewis,call guns and gangs.See if anything flags.

519
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,990
Copy that.

520
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:25,600
All right,the rest of us bravo at the club.Fast is good.We got a 6:00 deadline.

521
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,850
Let's stay off the news.

522
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:34,140
wait... I got it.

523
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,420
boss,got a call going out.

524
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,360
Yeah.

525
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,460
Okay,we've got them-- the override codes to get into the system.

526
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,110
Now you're going to get your money,but I want to hear her voice.

527
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,630
Spike,where would you go with override codes?

528
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:06,410
Basement.System would have to be rebooted from the secure servers there.

529
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:09,870
There's cctv in the basement hallways,but there's no eyes in the server room.

530
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,670
Okay,well,eyesould be good.

531
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,440
Turn the lights off in the hallways.

532
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,230
Got it.Eyes flying in.

533
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:29,800
don'T.No!No!No,please!Please,no!

534
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,920
We're gonna do a drive-by check for sentries.

535
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,600
If it's clear,we're gonna stage in the alley south of adee,full-on stealth approach.

536
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,960
Bad news.Guns and gangs says viper's controlled by huesos de tigre.

537
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,420
South american bangers.

538
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,470
That fits.

539
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:47,500
They use someone on the inside to hit up the bank,and then they use kidnapping to make sure they cooperate.

540
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,540
Le Gang unit's been profiling these guys since they moved in here three weeks ago.

541
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,740
My... my baby!Please!

542
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,100
This M.O. Goes one of two ways.

543
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,300
They either don't get the money and kill the hostage... 

544
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,680
and two?

545
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,920
My baby,please... please!

546
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,450
They get the money.

547
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,670
And they still kill the hostage.

548
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,830
we'll cross between the buildings.

549
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,410
We'll access through the roof.

550
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,650
Copy that.

551
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,850
We've I.D.'D two of them.

552
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:32,610
Okay,there's an oscar cardoza and a hector puente.

553
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:33,750
Just the two?

554
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,040
No,they say there's four,maybe five,start-up crew.

555
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,510
Could it be more?There's no way to know for sure.

556
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,860
Sam,you're sierra.

557
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,710
Copy that.

558
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,790
Spike: I'm in the basement and approaching the server room.

559
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,550
Deploying camera.Aeyesnd ears.How am I doing?

560
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:06,460
Subject's two floors away.

561
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,290
how far down?

562
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:23,230
The basement.Move.Seven minutes.

563
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,410
They're here.

564
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,900
Subject's approaching the main server.You seeing this?

565
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,900
Got it.

566
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,360
Stayedceal,spike.

567
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,000
Or the bad guy pulls the plug.Copy,boss.

568
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,720
That's the sver?

569
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:07,390
I got to enter the codes and reboot.

570
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:09,320
We get into the system and make the transfer.

571
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,470
Can you do that in seven minutes?

572
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,550
If you shut up,yes.

573
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,720
Wordy.

574
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:21,990
You're good?

575
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:24,050
Getting there.

576
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,810
Got it.

577
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:30,130
Bravo te going in.

578
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,820
What's going on?

579
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,700
Mein fra's powering up.

580
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,820
Come on,come on,come on,come on.

581
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,570
Okay,here we go.

582
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,480
okay,he's g it open.

583
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,490
He's in.

584
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,500
what?

585
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,740
What's happening,man?I can't see you.

586
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,870
I'm working on it.

587
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,360
-It's 6:00.
-No,it's not.

588
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,530
-I've got three minutes left.
-Don't play with me,man.

589
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,850
Look,what do you want?!

590
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:30,680
What,do you want a million dollars in your account or a mess on the floor?

591
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,940
I am going as fast as I can,so let me do this!

592
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,570
Single subject.Armed.

593
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:05,180
What about a distraction?

594
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:08,860
Bring him to us.One less inside.

595
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:32,720
jus,it's time.

596
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,560
-Jus?
-I know,I know.

597
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,770
Come on,come on,come on.

598
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,310
done.

599
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,710
no,no,no,no,no!

600
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:49,200
What is it?Justin,what'soing on?

601
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,660
Justin?!Justin,what is it?

602
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,630
-It's over.
-It's over?

603
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,330
Spike?

604
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:02,690
Sounds like he didn't get through.Maybe the codes were expired,the system time-bombed...

605
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:06,200
Bravo team,deal might have fallen through.What's your 20?

606
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,430
One floor away.

607
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,530
Boss,got a call going out.

608
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:14,140
I'm ready.

609
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:19,550
But I'm not doing it until I know maya's alive.So will you put her on the phone?

610
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:26,830
Justin?

611
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,690
Hey,sweetie.

612
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,740
Are you okay?

613
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:34,260
Did they... did...?

614
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,220
No.

615
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,110
I'm okay.

616
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:41,400
You got their money?

617
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:45,030
I tried.

618
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,770
I did.

619
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:49,600
I know you did.

620
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,090
I know.

621
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,710
Have I ever told you how much I love you?

622
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:03,430
Okay,you talked.

623
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:09,600
Justin: You'll have your money in a minute.

624
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,590
So your brother was right.

625
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,440
-What?
-Spike,stay alert.

626
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,020
Mike mckewonay be closer to this gang than we thought.

627
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,140
Copy,boss.

628
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,880
He's always talkg about you,man.

629
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,950
You're the smart one,right?

630
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,030
You know him?

631
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:28,780
He wasn't doing too good today,man,you know?

632
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:34,430
And then he tells us,"my brother justin,he works for a bank,"

633
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:39,380
and that you'd take care of it... like you always do.

634
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,230
He's a lucky guy to have a brother like you.

635
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:48,620
Spike,stay close.We got a situation.

636
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:53,370
jus,jus,look,there's gotta be something else we can do,right?

637
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,380
You know?We can do something else,man.Come on.

638
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:01,490
Just get back in there and,um... right,jus?

639
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:08,460
I'll take care of things... like I always do.

640
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:18,390
Jus,man,what the hell,man?

641
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,870
Get the,get the,get the gun off me.

642
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,750
You said you didn't know them.

643
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:24,880
They knew you.And you told them  ai workt a bank.

644
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,890
No,no,man,that's not what happened.

645
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:28,960
Stop lying to me!

646
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:33,410
spike,he's not picking up.You get in there.We're on our way.

647
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,490
Mike: No,that's not what happened.

648
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:39,270
Sru!Drop your weapon!

649
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:45,630
My wife is dead,so you...you do what you need to do.

650
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,950
It doesn't matter anymore.

651
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:49,360
Justin,we're working on getting your wife out safely.

652
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,640
You told them that I would do this for you,because... 

653
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,770
because I always cave,right?Because I always say yes.

654
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:58,660
They were gonna kill me,man.

655
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,500
So you sell me out?

656
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,810
And maya?

657
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:09,310
Okay,I do know those guys,I know 'em.

658
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:13,250
But I never thought they'd take maya,man.

659
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:15,180
I didn't even know about the half a million.

660
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,520
So you're just stupid.

661
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,370
And now you've killed my wife and my baby.

662
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:23,000
Parker: Justin,we know where your wife is.

663
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,980
We're here to help you.

664
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,830
My team is working on getting her right now.

665
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,450
-You're lying.
-No,no.

666
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:31,080
We're doing everything we can to make sure she comes out of there safely,

667
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,200
but hurting your brother's not gonna help anything.

668
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,690
This is his fault.

669
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:37,700
This is your fault!

670
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,310
He wrecks everything es touch!

671
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:43,750
Blaming him's not the answer,my man.

672
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,750
You both lost your parents.

673
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,940
I can't even imagine what that was like.

674
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,620
And then you both had to go your separate ways,but you got to stay with family.

675
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,000
Mike wasn't so lucky,was he?

676
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,770
He made his own luck.

677
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,480
He's been making his luck ever since.

678
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,430
Yeah,I'm just saying from his point of view,you got the roof over your head,

679
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,140
you got to go to school.

680
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:07,970
So when he's in trouble he comes to you because you owe him,right?

681
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,130
So he messes up,you always help him.

682
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:14,640
He counts on you,and you never let him down.

683
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,270
So,this is my fault?

684
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,870
I think your only fault is that you're always helping him.

685
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:22,680
It's hard not to help someone you love,though,right?

686
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,090
So,come on,my man.

687
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:27,950
Let someone help you for once.

688
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:31,060
We're gonna get your wife out of there.

689
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,520
We're gonna get your wife out.

690
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,260
Get your hands on your head!

691
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:39,210
Hands on your head! Hands on your head!

692
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:47,310
Boss,we're at the door.

693
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:50,990
answer the phone.

694
00:38:55,370 --> 00:39:00,350
spread the word,man,'cause this is what happens when you break your promise with huesos de tigres!
