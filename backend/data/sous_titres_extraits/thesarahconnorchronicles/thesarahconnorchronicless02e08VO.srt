00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,547
<i>Previously on</i> Terminator:
The Sarah Connor Chronicles...

2
00:00:02,858 --> 00:00:04,966
I'm here
because Sarah Connor is a deluded,

3
00:00:05,126 --> 00:00:06,718
dangerous,
grade a whack-a-mole

4
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:10,472
who killed a man because she believes
he'll invent a computer system

5
00:00:10,805 --> 00:00:12,265
that declares war on the world.

6
00:00:12,675 --> 00:00:15,601
I'm looking for this girl.
Have you seen my niece?

7
00:00:15,763 --> 00:00:18,396
There was a guy here
looking for your sister.

8
00:00:19,557 --> 00:00:21,455
- I'll get rid of him!
- Riley!

9
00:00:22,018 --> 00:00:23,652
If you don't leave, I call the police.

10
00:00:23,812 --> 00:00:26,571
That guy is really dangerous.
That's all you need to know.

11
00:00:26,982 --> 00:00:29,366
This has nothing to do with Riley.
You're pissed off

12
00:00:29,526 --> 00:00:32,028
because I found someone
I actually like spending time with,

13
00:00:32,148 --> 00:00:33,620
and it's not you.

14
00:00:44,168 --> 00:00:45,565
Riley, look at me.

15
00:00:45,941 --> 00:00:48,467
Show me that. That's horrifying.

16
00:00:48,587 --> 00:00:51,627
It's supposed to stop cars
from playing ping-pong with your head.

17
00:00:51,747 --> 00:00:53,329
I think your mom's out here.

18
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:54,900
Hi, Mrs. Baum!

19
00:00:55,301 --> 00:00:57,811
Thank you so much
for having me over.

20
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,859
I didn't even know if you were busy
tonight when I texted you.

21
00:01:05,197 --> 00:01:06,505
I'm never busy.

22
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,517
- So, I should do it again sometime.
- Or maybe you could call.

23
00:01:12,943 --> 00:01:14,649
You know, with your voice.

24
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:16,473
Maybe I could try that.

25
00:01:16,904 --> 00:01:17,956
Maybe you should.

26
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,561
See you soon?

27
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,461
Okay, be safe.

28
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:34,639
I bought her a helmet.

29
00:01:36,265 --> 00:01:37,366
Responsible.

30
00:01:38,305 --> 00:01:40,187
You think it'll stop a bullet?

31
00:01:40,307 --> 00:01:42,230
Why,
you gonna take a shot at her?

32
00:01:43,566 --> 00:01:46,469
A lot of bullets fly around here.
Someone will.

33
00:01:50,505 --> 00:01:51,905
You care about this girl?

34
00:01:54,268 --> 00:01:55,269
Yeah.

35
00:01:56,154 --> 00:01:57,656
Then leave her alone.

36
00:02:07,954 --> 00:02:09,600
I'll talk to John.

37
00:02:10,854 --> 00:02:12,385
John's not listening.

38
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:14,680
He's always listening.

39
00:02:35,757 --> 00:02:37,452
I was going to suggest a safe.

40
00:02:37,572 --> 00:02:40,038
Well, you might have suggested it
before we got robbed.

41
00:02:45,051 --> 00:02:46,459
Where are you going?

42
00:02:46,778 --> 00:02:48,835
I need to restock
the supply drop.

43
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:51,247
We've been using
a lot of ammunition.

44
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:54,010
Business has been booming.
Where's John?

45
00:02:55,077 --> 00:02:57,680
- Still in his room.
- He hasn't gotten up yet?

46
00:02:57,841 --> 00:02:59,775
He needs more sleep than you do.

47
00:02:59,895 --> 00:03:02,393
It's because the circadian rhythm
of teenagers is abnormal.

48
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,022
How late
were you up talking to him?

49
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:07,269
Not late.

50
00:03:08,018 --> 00:03:11,013
- He won't be seeing Riley anymore.
- Is that so?

51
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,231
John's not stupid.

52
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:17,242
I don't like the way
he responds to you.

53
00:03:19,309 --> 00:03:21,161
You got what you wanted.

54
00:04:08,693 --> 00:04:10,144
Where is he?

55
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:12,254
Check under the bed.

56
00:04:14,017 --> 00:04:15,048
You don't know.

57
00:04:21,554 --> 00:04:24,182
I didn't even know if you were
busy when I texted you tonight.

58
00:04:24,302 --> 00:04:25,605
I'm never busy.

59
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:30,955
So then I guess
I should do it again sometime.

60
00:04:31,075 --> 00:04:33,693
Or maybe you could even call.
You know, with your voice.

61
00:04:34,266 --> 00:04:35,721
Maybe I could try that.

62
00:04:35,841 --> 00:04:37,242
Maybe you should.

63
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:39,845
See you soon.

64
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,171
Go, be safe.

65
00:04:55,198 --> 00:04:56,599
I'll talk to John.

66
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,901
John's not listening.

67
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,276
He's always listening.

68
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:21,281
Are you busy?

69
00:05:31,369 --> 00:05:32,668
Did you change?

70
00:05:33,594 --> 00:05:34,796
It's hot out.

71
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,739
Since when do you feel heat?

72
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,151
I feel heat.

73
00:05:50,622 --> 00:05:52,932
Are you hoping that Riley's
gonna see us in bed together,

74
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:56,262
and be totally scarred
for the rest of her life or something?

75
00:05:57,873 --> 00:06:00,780
I watched Riley leave
till I couldn't see her anymore.

76
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,862
And then you and mom high-fived.

77
00:06:06,929 --> 00:06:09,231
You bring danger into Riley's life.

78
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:11,660
I know that.

79
00:06:13,016 --> 00:06:14,168
I'm not stupid.

80
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:17,081
But sometimes you do stupid things.

81
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:20,866
It would help me to understand why.

82
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:24,983
Humans do stupid things.

83
00:06:25,984 --> 00:06:29,058
So don't worry about it,
and be happy you're a machine.

84
00:06:29,572 --> 00:06:30,774
I'm a machine.

85
00:06:31,615 --> 00:06:33,017
I can't be happy.

86
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:38,401
But I understand
more than you think.

87
00:06:40,503 --> 00:06:42,729
So you understand
that I'm gonna keep seeing Riley,

88
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:44,866
even if everyone thinks
it's a bad idea.

89
00:06:45,301 --> 00:06:47,603
I understand that it's a bad idea.

90
00:06:51,204 --> 00:06:54,504
And I understand
that being John Connor can be lonely.

91
00:06:57,357 --> 00:06:58,358
Oh, yeah?

92
00:06:58,696 --> 00:07:00,597
How do you understand that?

93
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,594
You and I talk about it a lot.

94
00:07:06,444 --> 00:07:07,457
We do?

95
00:07:08,086 --> 00:07:09,086
We do.

96
00:07:10,382 --> 00:07:11,390
We will.

97
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,721
I need to get some sleep.

98
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:30,967
And Riley?

99
00:07:33,227 --> 00:07:34,234
I know.

100
00:07:37,217 --> 00:07:38,218
I know.

101
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:49,013
- He won't be seeing Riley anymore.
- I don't like

102
00:07:49,173 --> 00:07:51,077
the way he responds to you.

103
00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:53,830
You got what you wanted.

104
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:27,138
It's just you.

105
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,349
You been stealing my supplies?

106
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,278
We needed to make a small bomb.

107
00:08:36,398 --> 00:08:39,564
I set this drop up
with my people for my people.

108
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,899
And everything's in here
for a reason.

109
00:08:42,258 --> 00:08:44,152
John was supposed to ask.

110
00:08:47,218 --> 00:08:49,031
John needs to get his head
in the game.

111
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:55,496
Maybe he couldn't find you.

112
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,916
- You don't spend time at the house.
- I don't have a bed, remember?

113
00:09:01,076 --> 00:09:02,753
You didn't have a bed
in the old house.

114
00:09:02,913 --> 00:09:04,797
I had a gunshot wound
at the old house.

115
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:07,675
Yes.
You almost died.

116
00:09:07,835 --> 00:09:09,534
It's not the first time.

117
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:14,974
Who's that?

118
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:35,203
Alarm code from John.
He's in trouble.

119
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,582
I need to get some sleep.

120
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,506
And Riley?

121
00:09:56,442 --> 00:09:57,442
I know.

122
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,256
I know.

123
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,563
Yeah, right.

124
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,691
Hey.

125
00:10:32,585 --> 00:10:34,337
I'll be there in a few minutes.

126
00:10:53,004 --> 00:10:54,862
Episode 208: Mr. Ferguson is Ill Today
<i>v 1.00</i>

127
00:10:54,982 --> 00:10:57,492
http://Projet-SG.net

128
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:07,909
Please stop doing that.

129
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,125
Look, I got this
from my foster parents.

130
00:11:12,678 --> 00:11:15,633
And it's a rape whistle.
It's totally for moments like this.

131
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,289
Moments like this?
Yeah, all right.

132
00:11:23,581 --> 00:11:26,771
When I was a kid, I lived in Mexico
for a year and a half.

133
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,192
In this little village
called Dejalo.

134
00:11:31,592 --> 00:11:32,477
And...

135
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:36,490
that's where we're going.

136
00:11:37,592 --> 00:11:39,118
Thought I'd show you around.

137
00:11:41,697 --> 00:11:43,524
Well, did you run
this idea by your mom?

138
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:45,645
Because sometimes
I get the impression

139
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,834
that she doesn't
really like surprises.

140
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:49,061
I don't care.

141
00:11:50,004 --> 00:11:52,245
Did you guys
get in a fight last night?

142
00:11:53,122 --> 00:11:53,839
No.

143
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,833
So this is definitely a field trip,

144
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,515
and not some revenge fantasy?

145
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:04,521
If you don't wanna go, that's cool.

146
00:12:04,646 --> 00:12:06,540
Don't make me feel like
I'm kidnapping you.

147
00:12:06,665 --> 00:12:09,666
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

148
00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:11,817
You just caught me off guard.

149
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:13,892
I'm really, really happy

150
00:12:14,017 --> 00:12:16,365
that you want
to show me where you grew up.

151
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:19,824
Good.

152
00:12:22,563 --> 00:12:24,946
'Cause I booked the honeymoon suite.

153
00:12:25,071 --> 00:12:26,248
Wait, what?

154
00:12:34,109 --> 00:12:36,985
It's good, right?
It's nice to get some space.

155
00:12:37,771 --> 00:12:38,995
You and space.

156
00:12:39,462 --> 00:12:42,583
The first time we talked, you were
sitting by yourself in the grass.

157
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,039
That was space too.

158
00:12:45,153 --> 00:12:46,480
So it was.

159
00:12:47,907 --> 00:12:49,897
You know I used
to watch you at school?

160
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:51,834
When the bell would ring

161
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:54,140
and those narrow hallways
would fill up,

162
00:12:54,265 --> 00:12:57,239
it got so loud, and people
would bump into you.

163
00:12:57,648 --> 00:13:01,193
You looked like you could just
jump out the window and run away.

164
00:13:02,151 --> 00:13:04,515
God, you're such a little stalker.

165
00:13:04,722 --> 00:13:06,338
All right, so I get that...

166
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,458
We ran away to get some space.

167
00:13:10,795 --> 00:13:12,336
The only shame is...

168
00:13:14,015 --> 00:13:16,796
We ran all this way,
and there's skulls everywhere.

169
00:13:17,188 --> 00:13:18,884
What, you don't like skulls?

170
00:13:19,729 --> 00:13:21,011
I like other things better.

171
00:13:24,265 --> 00:13:25,765
It's for <i>Dia de los Muertos</i>.

172
00:13:26,146 --> 00:13:27,689
The festival's tonight.

173
00:13:28,148 --> 00:13:28,945
Nice.

174
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:33,068
Skulls and darkness,
how charming.

175
00:13:34,869 --> 00:13:36,364
Doing the best I can.

176
00:13:42,936 --> 00:13:45,453
I never want to leave this room.

177
00:13:46,506 --> 00:13:48,093
Wait, I think I see the problem.

178
00:13:48,218 --> 00:13:50,182
Would you just get in here?
We don't need bubbles.

179
00:13:50,307 --> 00:13:53,085
Well, there's bubbles to be had,
and I'm gonna have bubbles.

180
00:14:02,185 --> 00:14:03,459
Not bad, huh?

181
00:14:03,584 --> 00:14:05,014
You're a total pro.

182
00:14:07,642 --> 00:14:09,938
Wait, you didn't live here
with your mom, did you?

183
00:14:10,063 --> 00:14:11,063
No.

184
00:14:11,714 --> 00:14:12,647
We...

185
00:14:12,772 --> 00:14:15,191
we actually had
a cabana on the beach.

186
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,154
- We had very different childhoods.
- It wasn't always good.

187
00:14:21,784 --> 00:14:23,657
Sometimes I wish
we just stayed here.

188
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:25,826
Away from everybody.

189
00:14:28,213 --> 00:14:29,330
People suck.

190
00:14:30,435 --> 00:14:31,498
Not just people.

191
00:14:32,857 --> 00:14:33,959
No, I mean...

192
00:14:34,747 --> 00:14:36,795
when you meet someone, you don't

193
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,474
really expect to give
a damn about them, right?

194
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:42,336
Who's got the time?

195
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:44,428
Life's too short, and people suck.

196
00:14:48,212 --> 00:14:50,601
I don't like
getting attached to people.

197
00:14:57,914 --> 00:14:58,772
So...

198
00:14:59,961 --> 00:15:01,946
why were you living in Mexico?

199
00:15:04,948 --> 00:15:07,622
- You're thinking of a lie or a joke.
- No, I'm not.

200
00:15:07,747 --> 00:15:09,221
Yes, you are.
You have a tell.

201
00:15:09,346 --> 00:15:12,770
I just don't want to sit around
and talk about my messed up childhood.

202
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,127
Can't we just enjoy ourselves?

203
00:15:17,654 --> 00:15:19,377
Yeah, fine.

204
00:15:20,146 --> 00:15:21,600
Enjoy yourself, John.

205
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:25,147
I'm sure we're not the only ones that's
found themselves in a honeymoon suite,

206
00:15:25,272 --> 00:15:27,263
and not known the first thing
about each other.

207
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:37,584
You're right.

208
00:15:39,794 --> 00:15:40,901
People suck.

209
00:15:59,714 --> 00:16:01,646
Podemos tener picante, por favor?

210
00:16:01,771 --> 00:16:02,771
El verde?

211
00:16:03,282 --> 00:16:04,646
Es muy picante como fuego.

212
00:16:04,771 --> 00:16:06,056
Si, exactamente.

213
00:16:06,283 --> 00:16:08,262
- What was that about?
- Hot sauce.

214
00:16:10,906 --> 00:16:14,101
You know, they do
this killer Thanksgiving buffet here.

215
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:16,478
I bet.

216
00:16:17,717 --> 00:16:18,449
See?

217
00:16:18,932 --> 00:16:21,066
I'm telling you
all sorts of good stuff.

218
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,171
I'm not trying
to be your stalker, I just...

219
00:16:25,296 --> 00:16:27,656
This is what we should be doing.
Getting to know each other.

220
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:30,326
Well, I have a question for you.

221
00:16:32,398 --> 00:16:34,596
You said that I have a tell.

222
00:16:35,935 --> 00:16:37,022
What is it?

223
00:16:37,521 --> 00:16:39,627
Okay, you promise not
to obsess over it or anything?

224
00:16:44,277 --> 00:16:45,883
What a handsome couple.

225
00:16:46,647 --> 00:16:48,309
And for only $5,

226
00:16:48,812 --> 00:16:50,702
- a photo memory.
- No, thanks.

227
00:16:51,297 --> 00:16:53,233
See, a beautiful shot.

228
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:55,016
And it's all digital.

229
00:16:55,178 --> 00:16:57,268
Which means I can email it to you.

230
00:16:57,429 --> 00:16:59,104
I think I have something
in my teeth.

231
00:16:59,264 --> 00:17:02,271
- Oh, well, let me take another.
- No, no, really, that's okay.

232
00:17:02,435 --> 00:17:04,025
Hey, I said that's okay.

233
00:17:05,476 --> 00:17:08,330
Look, man, why don't I...
Why don't I just give you five bucks,

234
00:17:08,455 --> 00:17:10,521
and you'll delete it.
Can you do that?

235
00:17:10,646 --> 00:17:11,867
Gracias, joven.

236
00:17:16,574 --> 00:17:19,708
The young boy and mother
who stayed in Vivian's cabana.

237
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:21,811
Thanks a lot.

238
00:17:23,215 --> 00:17:24,380
John Connor.

239
00:17:25,249 --> 00:17:26,882
No se de quien estas hablando.

240
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:29,426
You're Sarah Connor's son.

241
00:17:32,835 --> 00:17:34,181
I'll be right back.

242
00:17:42,463 --> 00:17:44,994
I remember
when the Connors left Dejalo.

243
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,602
And I remember

244
00:17:47,727 --> 00:17:50,433
the stories that were told
after you were gone.

245
00:17:52,453 --> 00:17:55,160
Man, you really... you really
mixed me up with somebody else.

246
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,209
I'm just...

247
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:58,789
These are pictures you wouldn't want
the authorities to see.

248
00:18:00,584 --> 00:18:02,959
- How much?
- Everything you've got.

249
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:07,464
Hey, back off, man.

250
00:18:09,768 --> 00:18:11,361
We gotta get out of here, now.
Run!

251
00:18:11,486 --> 00:18:12,204
No!

252
00:18:17,376 --> 00:18:19,893
No se puede salir sin pagar!

253
00:18:32,086 --> 00:18:33,778
Puedo pagar la camara.

254
00:18:33,903 --> 00:18:37,061
Stick to English, kid.
The American accent is killing me.

255
00:18:38,087 --> 00:18:40,024
This is a misunderstanding,
that's all.

256
00:18:40,149 --> 00:18:41,779
I'll pay for the camera, okay?

257
00:18:41,904 --> 00:18:44,168
What the hell
were you doing down here anyway?

258
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:47,546
- We're just tourists.
- Cancun's not good for you?

259
00:18:48,297 --> 00:18:49,298
This is the guy?

260
00:18:49,522 --> 00:18:51,675
Yes, sir.
I was about to take his statement.

261
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,853
A man took a picture of me and
my girlfriend, he wanted us to buy it.

262
00:18:57,978 --> 00:19:00,317
It was crowded, someone bumped into him,
he dropped his camera.

263
00:19:00,442 --> 00:19:03,019
I was afraid a fight was gonna start,
so we tried to leave, that's all.

264
00:19:03,181 --> 00:19:05,024
- How old are you?
- 16.

265
00:19:05,149 --> 00:19:06,523
- You were drinking?
- No.

266
00:19:06,648 --> 00:19:07,669
You have parents.

267
00:19:08,462 --> 00:19:09,839
My mother and an uncle.

268
00:19:09,964 --> 00:19:11,474
They know where you are?

269
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,175
No.

270
00:19:18,105 --> 00:19:19,737
I'll make you a deal.

271
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:23,347
If they come pick you up,
I'll let you go with a warning.

272
00:19:34,547 --> 00:19:35,797
<i>Leave a message.</i>

273
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,892
- What the hell was that?
- My uncle's voice mail.

274
00:19:42,053 --> 00:19:43,215
Call your mother.

275
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
<i>Hello?</i>

276
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,398
<i>John, thank God.
Where are you?</i>

277
00:19:58,883 --> 00:20:00,834
<i>I've been going out of my mind.</i>

278
00:20:04,401 --> 00:20:06,897
- Did you get through?
- <i>John, are you there?</i>

279
00:20:07,022 --> 00:20:08,491
<i>Are you in trouble?</i>

280
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,187
She didn't answer.

281
00:20:16,835 --> 00:20:18,220
Put him in holding.

282
00:20:18,345 --> 00:20:20,305
In a few hours,
give him another phone call.

283
00:20:21,257 --> 00:20:23,016
And run his name through Interpol.

284
00:20:23,471 --> 00:20:24,471
Yes, sir.

285
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:29,061
So which name should I run?

286
00:20:29,684 --> 00:20:32,399
The one on your passport?
Or the real one?

287
00:20:59,511 --> 00:21:01,464
Sir, Sir, hello?

288
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:03,870
Hi, can you come here, please?

289
00:21:14,652 --> 00:21:16,099
I need your help, please.

290
00:21:16,224 --> 00:21:18,031
This guy in here
is a complete psycho.

291
00:21:18,156 --> 00:21:20,506
He's been trying
to make moves on me.

292
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:22,591
You two came in together.

293
00:21:23,154 --> 00:21:25,654
Sir, do you have children?

294
00:21:25,845 --> 00:21:27,279
Do you have a daughter?

295
00:21:27,404 --> 00:21:30,339
My dad told me to stay away from him,
and he was totally right.

296
00:21:30,464 --> 00:21:33,862
This guy's a complete freak.
I don't care how much trouble I'm in.

297
00:21:33,987 --> 00:21:36,798
All I want to do is call home
and tell them where I am.

298
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,070
Please?

299
00:21:41,263 --> 00:21:42,628
Take a step back.

300
00:21:42,753 --> 00:21:44,543
- I'm going to open the door.
- Thank you.

301
00:21:54,101 --> 00:21:56,096
<i>Lo siento, señor.
Lo siento.</i>

302
00:21:58,868 --> 00:22:00,479
Riley, you need to listen to me.

303
00:22:00,604 --> 00:22:03,717
No matter what happens,
if you see daylight, you run.

304
00:22:03,842 --> 00:22:05,689
Okay, don't wait for me.
Just run.

305
00:22:05,814 --> 00:22:09,041
- What? What are you do...
- If you see daylight, you run.

306
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:23,095
Your strategy has changed.

307
00:22:23,255 --> 00:22:24,221
Has it?

308
00:22:24,381 --> 00:22:27,392
The first time we met,
you tried to kill yourself.

309
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,733
You're right.
This time I'm going to kill you.

310
00:22:36,757 --> 00:22:38,318
She hasn't been careful.

311
00:22:38,853 --> 00:22:40,278
She's made mistakes.

312
00:22:40,802 --> 00:22:42,893
Not as many as you, but enough.

313
00:22:43,727 --> 00:22:45,914
Does she have damage to her chip?

314
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:51,206
- She has damage to her chip.
- How did you find the house?

315
00:22:51,634 --> 00:22:52,932
The boy told me.

316
00:22:53,452 --> 00:22:55,585
The one from the bowling alley.

317
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,715
You should have killed him.

318
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:01,842
Just like you should
have killed yourself.

319
00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:05,303
- I'm not a murderer.
- Who is?

320
00:25:10,854 --> 00:25:12,781
I need you to come with me.

321
00:25:32,738 --> 00:25:34,023
Agent Crossman,

322
00:25:35,287 --> 00:25:36,457
how you doing?

323
00:25:38,488 --> 00:25:41,470
It's good to hear from you.
What's on your mind?

324
00:25:45,496 --> 00:25:46,507
Mexico.

325
00:25:48,557 --> 00:25:49,746
You don't say.

326
00:25:53,996 --> 00:25:55,138
I suppose

327
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:58,697
that they don't have anyone
looking into it over at the bureau.

328
00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:00,929
I know.

329
00:26:01,648 --> 00:26:03,739
That case has been cold since '99.

330
00:26:03,864 --> 00:26:05,379
I was just curious.

331
00:26:08,678 --> 00:26:11,228
Sure, email it over
and I'll take a look.

332
00:26:15,233 --> 00:26:16,233
Hold on.

333
00:26:24,686 --> 00:26:28,248
Yeah, yeah, you're right.
It does look a little bit like him.

334
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,969
God rest his soul.

335
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:35,287
You're with the American FBI?

336
00:26:35,807 --> 00:26:37,157
Yes, that's right.

337
00:26:41,968 --> 00:26:43,605
You have a boy in your custody.

338
00:26:43,895 --> 00:26:46,930
His arrest report
lists an alias of John Connor,

339
00:26:47,162 --> 00:26:48,985
which matches a fugitive of mine.

340
00:26:49,417 --> 00:26:51,331
The domestic terrorism case.

341
00:26:52,575 --> 00:26:54,350
You're familiar with the Connors?

342
00:26:54,475 --> 00:26:56,143
It was flagged during processing.

343
00:26:56,268 --> 00:26:58,453
But we dismissed it
as a coincidence.

344
00:26:58,904 --> 00:27:01,542
Your fugitive would be
24 years old by now,

345
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,124
if he was not already dead.

346
00:27:03,525 --> 00:27:04,525
Look,

347
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:06,759
I'd be grateful

348
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,164
for just a visual identification

349
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:11,341
to help bring me some closure.

350
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:18,431
You have traveled
an awful long way for closure.

351
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:22,067
If he is who I think he is,

352
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,389
then I have reason to believe
that your prisoner is in danger.

353
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,218
And yes, I've come a long way.

354
00:27:37,694 --> 00:27:38,518
Excuse me.

355
00:28:26,853 --> 00:28:27,876
Daylight, run!

356
00:28:31,998 --> 00:28:33,590
John!
I'm here to help you.

357
00:28:35,793 --> 00:28:37,173
Oh, my God!

358
00:28:39,841 --> 00:28:41,181
The car, Riley!

359
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:42,682
Get in the car, now!

360
00:28:44,011 --> 00:28:45,612
Now! Get in!

361
00:29:05,698 --> 00:29:07,052
- You okay?
- Yeah.

362
00:29:08,118 --> 00:29:09,118
I'm fine.

363
00:29:12,158 --> 00:29:14,427
Are there any rounds in this thing?

364
00:29:19,337 --> 00:29:21,807
Look for more ammunition.
We need more!

365
00:29:25,635 --> 00:29:27,375
- What, you okay?
- I felt something!

366
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:29,452
Stop the car.
Stop the car.

367
00:29:46,635 --> 00:29:48,558
I need you to come with me.

368
00:29:51,005 --> 00:29:52,005
Mom.

369
00:29:55,832 --> 00:29:57,133
We need to move.

370
00:30:13,393 --> 00:30:16,703
It's a clear shot all the way up
the alley back to the jail.

371
00:30:17,139 --> 00:30:18,820
No, that's where it will be waiting.

372
00:30:19,643 --> 00:30:20,893
Let me do that.

373
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:24,315
I need to be able to use it.

374
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:27,117
I should hope so.

375
00:30:29,222 --> 00:30:30,617
Why are you here?

376
00:30:33,828 --> 00:30:36,206
John was flagged
in the FBI computer.

377
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,466
Couldn't you just have buried it?

378
00:30:42,671 --> 00:30:44,259
It's been watching me.

379
00:30:45,582 --> 00:30:46,581
It?

380
00:30:47,864 --> 00:30:48,889
Out there.

381
00:30:51,213 --> 00:30:53,217
And you still came to Mexico?

382
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,941
- You could have led it right to John.
- It wasn't me in the trunk.

383
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,694
So what were you gonna do,
just pop him out of jail?

384
00:30:59,895 --> 00:31:01,892
Set him free,
no questions asked?

385
00:31:02,017 --> 00:31:03,167
Yes, actually.

386
00:31:03,475 --> 00:31:07,438
- That's exactly what I was going to do.
- I have a hard time believing that.

387
00:31:10,457 --> 00:31:11,748
I owed you one.

388
00:31:13,752 --> 00:31:16,503
The fire.
Silberman's cabin?

389
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,883
Wasn't much.

390
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:20,895
It was my life.

391
00:31:23,305 --> 00:31:25,283
How you feel
about that now?

392
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,709
You have to go.

393
00:31:34,148 --> 00:31:37,819
I promise I'll call you
as soon as we get back to LA.

394
00:31:38,762 --> 00:31:40,279
But you have to go.

395
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,372
Riley, don't.

396
00:31:46,028 --> 00:31:47,028
Go home.

397
00:31:48,234 --> 00:31:51,120
I swear I'll explain
everything when I get there.

398
00:31:51,338 --> 00:31:53,706
Go out the back. Run due east.
There's a bus route.

399
00:31:54,222 --> 00:31:56,146
You know what else there is?

400
00:31:56,271 --> 00:31:58,460
A man with a gun
who's killing people.

401
00:31:58,585 --> 00:32:01,335
He won't follow you
if you run away from me.

402
00:32:02,209 --> 00:32:04,294
I don't wanna run away from you.

403
00:32:07,522 --> 00:32:08,996
Get her out of here.

404
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:19,124
I need your phone.

405
00:32:20,085 --> 00:32:21,135
Have a plan?

406
00:32:22,212 --> 00:32:23,606
I've got a weapon.

407
00:32:26,649 --> 00:32:28,622
The girl from the bank vault?

408
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:40,318
- John and I are in trouble. I need you.
- John's with you?

409
00:32:40,443 --> 00:32:42,257
We're here already.
We're at the jail.

410
00:32:42,382 --> 00:32:43,382
What?

411
00:32:58,032 --> 00:32:59,480
Cromartie's here.

412
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,118
Then we should stay undercover.

413
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:23,444
I'm looking for John Baum.

414
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:25,618
- Where is he?
- <I>Yo no se.</I>

415
00:33:25,743 --> 00:33:27,216
We gotta get out of here.

416
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:30,053
- We gotta find John.
- We're no good to him dead.

417
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,090
I can't let anything happen to him.

418
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:45,839
Escaped or dead?

419
00:33:46,028 --> 00:33:47,028
Escaped!

420
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:50,309
A little help, por favor?

421
00:33:50,555 --> 00:33:52,523
Don't worry, it won't be back.

422
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:55,279
Please!

423
00:34:03,582 --> 00:34:06,464
- John and I are in trouble. I need you.
- John's with you?

424
00:34:06,985 --> 00:34:09,459
We're here already.
We're at the jail.

425
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:10,744
What?

426
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:12,992
Wait, wait, wait, Sarah.

427
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,515
Then where's Cromartie?

428
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,020
I am sorry, señor,

429
00:34:21,145 --> 00:34:23,795
but I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

430
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,441
I'm gonna need to see John Connor.

431
00:35:14,133 --> 00:35:17,034
- I'm looking for John Connor.
- He's gone.

432
00:35:18,205 --> 00:35:20,009
Are there any other exits?

433
00:37:28,516 --> 00:37:30,224
Have you come to repent?

434
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,177
I'm looking for John Connor.

435
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:36,026
All things are possible

436
00:37:36,307 --> 00:37:37,783
to him who believes.

437
00:39:28,988 --> 00:39:31,664
We'll attract less attention
if we don't travel together.

438
00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:35,264
You want me to leave?

439
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,266
What's next?

440
00:39:38,963 --> 00:39:40,835
We'll come back down here.

441
00:39:41,983 --> 00:39:44,689
And bring something
with us to destroy it.

442
00:39:46,903 --> 00:39:49,022
His name's gonna be on an alert.

443
00:39:49,777 --> 00:39:51,327
He's got other names.

444
00:39:53,013 --> 00:39:54,020
Then what?

445
00:39:54,981 --> 00:39:56,648
There is no "then what".

446
00:39:57,435 --> 00:39:58,774
Pretend I died again.

447
00:40:00,488 --> 00:40:03,235
I lost a lot
when you died the first time.

448
00:40:04,205 --> 00:40:05,968
My marriage, my career.

449
00:40:07,445 --> 00:40:08,980
That's a lot to you?

450
00:40:13,484 --> 00:40:15,791
I suppose many people
lost those things.

451
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:22,423
You want answers.

452
00:40:23,667 --> 00:40:26,373
I just want to know my role
in all of this.

453
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,721
What happens after this?

454
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:30,446
This is it.

455
00:40:32,673 --> 00:40:35,256
There's nothing else
behind the curtain.

456
00:40:36,117 --> 00:40:38,290
This is what I do.
It's all I do.

457
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:41,233
You already know why I do it.

458
00:40:44,045 --> 00:40:45,931
I'm sorry for what you lost.

459
00:40:47,299 --> 00:40:49,855
But I can't help you
get any of it back.

460
00:40:58,919 --> 00:41:00,381
Can I have the chip?
