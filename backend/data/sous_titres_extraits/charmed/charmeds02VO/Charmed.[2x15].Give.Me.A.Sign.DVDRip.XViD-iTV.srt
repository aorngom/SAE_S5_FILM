1
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:17,838
All right, Jessup, let's go.

2
00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:21,638
- Where?
- Downtown. Evidentiary hearing.

3
00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:24,966
My hearing?
It's not supposed to be until next week.

4
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:27,564
Got moved up.

5
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:30,966
- Open up Bane Jessup.
- Opening up Jessup.

6
00:00:33,529 --> 00:00:35,281
I've never seen you guys before.

7
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:37,639
Hey, look, it's your hearing,
you don't wanna go, fine.

8
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:46,398
Garbage in, garbage out, huh?

9
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:50,564
Litvack sent you, didn't he?

10
00:01:20,929 --> 00:01:22,248
Hey. Hey.

11
00:01:24,449 --> 00:01:26,087
Stop.

12
00:01:32,089 --> 00:01:33,408
Hey, what's going on here?

13
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:43,041
Leo's mortal now and everything,
but for how long?

14
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:46,281
I mean, how do I know he won't
want his wings back some day?

15
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:51,483
And then there's Dan,
who is still great and normal.

16
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:55,961
- Which is good considering I'm not.
- Twenty-eight minutes, 33 seconds.

17
00:01:56,169 --> 00:01:57,443
Really? We ran that long?

18
00:01:57,649 --> 00:02:00,004
No, I'm timing how long
you've been comparing Leo and Dan.

19
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:03,360
I haven't been comparing,
I've just been talking.

20
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:05,127
Non-stop.

21
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:07,598
Well, so, you're my sister,
I have a problem,

22
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:09,839
the least you could be
is more understanding.

23
00:02:10,049 --> 00:02:12,358
Piper, I am understanding.

24
00:02:12,529 --> 00:02:14,520
You're in love with two guys
who both love you.

25
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:16,486
I get it. Totally.

26
00:02:16,649 --> 00:02:19,322
But what I don't get
is why you won't let me help you.

27
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:22,561
Help me? What are you gonna do?
Take one of them off my hands?

28
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:24,318
That's not an option.

29
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:26,198
Look, you're stuck.

30
00:02:26,369 --> 00:02:28,644
You don't wanna string them along,
but you can't make a choice.

31
00:02:28,809 --> 00:02:32,438
You need help, assistance, a sign.

32
00:02:32,649 --> 00:02:34,480
- A sign?
- A spell.

33
00:02:34,649 --> 00:02:37,607
One that will point the magical arrow
in the direction of your true love

34
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:39,765
and end the great debate
once and for all.

35
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:43,202
Like that doesn't have personal gain
tattooed across its forehead.

36
00:02:43,369 --> 00:02:46,884
Not necessarily.
I've been working on my spells.

37
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:50,200
I think I can write one for you
that's consequence free.

38
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:52,166
It's all in the wording.

39
00:02:52,649 --> 00:02:55,686
- No. I can't.
- Why not?

40
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:59,564
Because I can't expect magic
to solve my personal problems.

41
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:02,118
But that's the beauty.
You don't have to. I'll do it for you.

42
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:04,280
Hey, when did
my camera equipment get here?

43
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:07,122
Oh, about an hour ago. I didn't wanna
wake you. Is everything there?

44
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:09,280
Yeah, it looks like it.

45
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:13,284
Jeez, Prue,
think you bought enough stuff?

46
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:14,638
Yeah, I know. It's a lot.

47
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,404
But so much of photography
has gone digital now

48
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:20,766
that if I wanna seriously pursue it,
I have to have the right equipment.

49
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:24,644
Wait, you're thinking of becoming
a professional photographer?

50
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:29,079
Yeah. Why, you don't think
that I should?

51
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:33,805
No, no, I mean, I think it's great
if it's what you wanna do, it's just...

52
00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:36,008
It's just what?

53
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:41,078
Well, isn't photography just
a really dicey profession moneywise?

54
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:44,324
You know, all I'm saying

55
00:03:44,529 --> 00:03:47,123
is that, how many women professional
photographers do you know?

56
00:03:48,249 --> 00:03:50,046
I know, and that is
a totally fair question,

57
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:52,086
one that I've been
wrestling with a lot lately.

58
00:03:52,249 --> 00:03:54,717
Like, ever since I quit my job.

59
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:58,519
Prue, you dreamt of winning the
Pulitzer in photography back in college.

60
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:01,840
You never wanted to work in
the museum or at the auction house.

61
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:04,284
That's something you did for us
so we could keep the house.

62
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:07,287
So now it is your turn
to follow your dreams.

63
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:10,441
Hey, maybe finding out you were
a photographer in your last life

64
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:12,565
is some kind of sign.

65
00:04:13,929 --> 00:04:15,521
Speaking of signs.

66
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:20,044
No. Wait. No.

67
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:35,320
Portrait of a dreamer.

68
00:04:36,929 --> 00:04:40,001
Phoebe, you're not in there
writing a spell for me, are you?

69
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:43,960
No. I'm in the bathroom.
Who writes spells in the bathroom?

70
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:46,046
I'll be right out.

71
00:04:46,249 --> 00:04:49,685
Okay.
I beseech all powers above

72
00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:52,363
Send a sign to frame my sister's heart

73
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:56,721
One that will lead her to her love

74
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:01,080
Hello, Prue.

75
00:06:32,049 --> 00:06:34,438
- Well?
- Nothing.

76
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:37,117
Okay, we have to keep trying
till you do get a premonition.

77
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:39,086
We have to figure out
what happened to Prue.

78
00:06:39,929 --> 00:06:44,002
Piper, that crack that I made
about her becoming a photographer,

79
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:46,285
I don't want that to be the last thing
I say to her.

80
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:49,083
Phoebe, you're overreacting.
That is my department.

81
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:51,399
All you have to do
is relax and concentrate.

82
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:54,923
Here. Try the rag again.

83
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:09,564
I got bad news and I got worse news.
Which do you want first?

84
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,526
Phoebe.

85
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:16,285
Does this have anything
to do with Prue?

86
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:19,807
Unless she helped Bane Jessup
escape from county jail, no.

87
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:22,318
Bane Jessup, why does
that name sound familiar?

88
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:24,400
Because he's the guy
our favourite demon

89
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:26,042
hired to eighty-six us, remember?

90
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:29,047
- The one we thought Prue liked?
- Yes.

91
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:30,403
When did he escape?

92
00:07:30,609 --> 00:07:33,646
This morning. We've already launched
a full-scale manhunt to...

93
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:35,961
What is it? What's wrong?

94
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:38,404
Prue is missing. We think
she may have been kidnapped.

95
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:41,163
And we found this by the back door.

96
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:44,838
Chloroform.

97
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:49,725
We would've called you, but we didn't
know who or what had taken her.

98
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:51,681
Be a pretty big coincidence
if it wasn't Bane,

99
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:54,409
especially since you guys
are responsible for putting him in jail.

100
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:56,845
Yeah, but why take just Prue?
Why not all of us?

101
00:07:57,289 --> 00:07:59,325
Well, maybe he's trying to lure us.

102
00:07:59,489 --> 00:08:01,445
Maybe another demon
hired him to trap us.

103
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:03,643
Which might explain this.

104
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:06,239
I found it when we swept
the prison lot this morning.

105
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:08,081
It's actually the reason
why I came over.

106
00:08:08,249 --> 00:08:10,843
I wanted to see
if it looked familiar to you.

107
00:08:12,929 --> 00:08:14,157
Well, it's definitely demonic.

108
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:15,604
Do you mind if we keep this

109
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:17,964
so we can figure out
what demon we're dealing with?

110
00:08:18,369 --> 00:08:21,281
I can't exactly turn that in
to evidence inventory.

111
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:26,041
Look, I gotta go.
Let me know if you find out anything.

112
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:29,485
I think that your chances of
finding Bane are bigger than ours now.

113
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:31,446
Yeah. And could you maybe
keep this quiet,

114
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:34,322
because the bigger this thing gets,
the more danger she's...

115
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:38,717
I know. Look, I'll keep it as quiet
as I can, for as long as I can.

116
00:08:39,249 --> 00:08:40,238
Thanks.

117
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:48,724
Hi there. Gotta sign.
It's for Piper, Piper Halliwell?

118
00:08:51,969 --> 00:08:53,846
Can I see that?

119
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:59,605
Leonardo's Boutique.
Bodega Bay, California.

120
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:03,445
Yeah, Dan and I were there,
ordered some earrings. Thank you.

121
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,360
The deliveryman said he "gotta sign."

122
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:15,444
Leonardo's Boutique in Bodega Bay.

123
00:09:15,609 --> 00:09:19,887
Leo, short for Leonardo.
Bodega Bay, where Dan is from.

124
00:09:21,689 --> 00:09:23,919
Don't act blonde.
You cast that spell, didn't you?

125
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:27,678
- Yes, I did.
- When I specifically asked you not to.

126
00:09:27,849 --> 00:09:30,522
- And at a time like this.
- I was just trying to help, Piper.

127
00:09:30,689 --> 00:09:35,285
- And it was before Prue disappeared.
- You, this, Book of Shadows, go.

128
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:45,642
- What? What did you see?
- Prue, bound and gagged.

129
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:47,003
And with Bane.

130
00:10:03,249 --> 00:10:06,446
- Don't scream.
- Why not?

131
00:10:07,449 --> 00:10:10,646
Because if you do,
we won't be able to talk.

132
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:13,687
Besides, it won't help. The nearest
neighbour is about six miles away.

133
00:10:13,849 --> 00:10:16,079
Why not take off the blindfold?
What are you afraid of?

134
00:10:16,569 --> 00:10:20,403
Are you kidding? I've seen you use
your powers before. On me.

135
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:26,680
All right, if you try anything,
the blindfold goes back on.

136
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:34,966
What do you want?

137
00:10:35,689 --> 00:10:38,157
Your help. To save my life.

138
00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:40,724
Well, most people ask for it,
they don't kidnap for it.

139
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:43,397
I'm not most people.
Neither are you.

140
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,167
What makes you think
that I'll help you?

141
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:48,168
I don't.
But without you and your sisters,

142
00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:50,644
I don't stand a chance
against this particular demon.

143
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:53,643
Yeah, well, from where I'm sitting
that's a good thing.

144
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:58,638
He tried to have me killed today, Prue.
I got lucky and barely escaped.

145
00:10:58,849 --> 00:10:59,964
And he's gonna keep trying.

146
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:02,199
Why would he bother?
You're a mortal.

147
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:06,123
A mortal that knows about demons.
He doesn't like that.

148
00:11:06,489 --> 00:11:08,639
Litvack, that's what they call him.

149
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:11,923
Where are we?

150
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:15,963
This yours?

151
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:17,883
It was going to be,

152
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:20,517
before you came along,
cut me off from my dreams.

153
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,481
Because you tried to kill me.

154
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:25,484
Well, that was before
I got to know you.

155
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:27,522
You don't strike me as a dreamer.

156
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:30,045
Well, there's a lot about me
you don't know.

157
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,560
A few things that you need
to learn about me too.

158
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:40,442
Like how I will never
put my sisters in danger.

159
00:11:40,609 --> 00:11:43,487
So you can forget about
any of us helping you.

160
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:53,280
Sooner or later,
you're gonna have to trust me, Prue.

161
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:21,447
About freaking time.
What took you so long?

162
00:12:21,609 --> 00:12:26,524
- We had a little problem.
- Problem? What problem?

163
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:28,805
Where's your partner?

164
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:31,125
Do not tell me
that you screwed this up.

165
00:12:31,289 --> 00:12:34,838
Do not tell me
that Bane Jessup is still alive.

166
00:12:35,049 --> 00:12:36,846
How is that even possible?

167
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:39,643
He's a lousy mortal.
How hard can it be?

168
00:12:39,849 --> 00:12:43,319
He's smart. He wasn't surprised
we were coming for him.

169
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,599
Of course not, you idiot.

170
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:49,159
That's why we wanted him offed.
Because he knows about us.

171
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:54,519
Oh, jeez, think, think, think.
What are we gonna tell Litvack?

172
00:12:54,689 --> 00:12:59,763
You're going to tell me how you plan
to rectify this little problem,

173
00:12:59,969 --> 00:13:02,244
is how I believe you phrased it.

174
00:13:02,809 --> 00:13:04,208
On your knees.

175
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:26,962
I saw what you saw.

176
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:33,320
How he used you to kill the other,
how he got away.

177
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:37,166
- How you lost the weapon.
- Wait, wait, wait. What?

178
00:13:37,369 --> 00:13:38,563
You lost the weapon?

179
00:13:38,729 --> 00:13:40,959
The guards were coming,
I had to run.

180
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:45,168
To find a mortal,
all you need to do is follow his dreams.

181
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:47,925
That's where they always escape to.

182
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:49,878
Do you understand me?

183
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:53,887
He'll find Jessup. I swear.

184
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:55,883
No.

185
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,240
You will.
And then you'll find the weapon.

186
00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:09,326
No loose ends.

187
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:20,203
We couldn't find it
in the Book of Shadows anywhere.

188
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:22,877
- It's a weapon.
- Are you kidding me? It's a weapon?

189
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:25,358
One that can only be activated
by a demon.

190
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:28,248
From what I remember, it's handed out
by a specific upper-level demon

191
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,728
to those who work for him.

192
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:33,319
- What do you mean upper-level?
- There's a hierarchy of demons.

193
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:36,959
They try to work their way up
by destroying good, promoting evil.

194
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:39,802
Whoever issued this particular weapon
is very important.

195
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:44,764
- You mean dangerous. Any idea who?
- No.

196
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:49,478
All right, well, this weapon may be
the only way to find Prue.

197
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:51,640
I'm back to the Book.

198
00:14:52,729 --> 00:14:54,242
I'll be right there.

199
00:14:54,409 --> 00:14:56,161
Thanks for coming over
so quickly, Leo,

200
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:57,921
and your offer
to take care of the club.

201
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:00,045
Is there anything else you need?

202
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:03,042
I don't know. I can't do anything
but think about Prue right now.

203
00:15:04,289 --> 00:15:06,849
Remember, you know
the most important thing.

204
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,798
Phoebe's premonition proves
that Prue is still alive.

205
00:15:10,849 --> 00:15:14,046
I know. But for how long?
I mean, what if we can't get to her?

206
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:15,403
What if she's hurt?

207
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:21,647
I wish I could do more...

208
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:26,806
...because I can't help, but remember
all the times that I could.

209
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:51,043
I don't think you understand.

210
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:54,007
As long as you're here with me,
your life is on the line too, you know.

211
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:56,518
- I can take care of myself.
- Not against Litvack.

212
00:15:56,729 --> 00:15:58,526
You have a fighting chance
with your sisters,

213
00:15:58,689 --> 00:16:01,965
but as long as you're alone,
you're as powerless as I am.

214
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,478
Even if you can't trust me,
you can trust that.

215
00:16:04,689 --> 00:16:06,680
I told you I'm not getting
my sisters involved.

216
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:09,562
All right, fine. Your sisters
came looking for you once before,

217
00:16:09,729 --> 00:16:11,924
they'll come looking again.

218
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:13,523
Not if I can help it.

219
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:23,204
A weapon issued
by level-two demons?

220
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:26,044
But it doesn't say
which level-two demon.

221
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:34,279
- I love it when it does that.
- "Mariners"?

222
00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:37,287
Well, they're not demons,
they're sea fairies.

223
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:41,362
That's because it has nothing to do
with Prue, Phoebe, it's a sign.

224
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:44,089
Dan was a baseball player
for the Seattle Mariners.

225
00:16:44,249 --> 00:16:46,843
No one feels worse
than I do right now.

226
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:50,804
Prue, you're okay, thank God.

227
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,324
Yeah, but Bane Jessup,
he kidnapped me.

228
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:54,757
We know. Where are you?

229
00:16:54,929 --> 00:16:56,726
- You can't find me.
- What do you mean?

230
00:16:56,889 --> 00:16:58,686
It's a trap, just stay away,
don't look for me.

231
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:01,722
- What? Wait. Wait, Prue.
- Wait. Hello?

232
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:05,967
Hey, are you all right?

233
00:17:06,129 --> 00:17:07,642
I thought you passed out
or something.

234
00:17:09,009 --> 00:17:10,840
Feeling guilty?

235
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:13,679
That's a good sign.
Means that you have a conscience.

236
00:17:17,649 --> 00:17:18,843
What are you doing?

237
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:23,000
- I'm letting you go.
- Just like that?

238
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,484
I never wanted to hurt you, Prue.
I only wanted your help.

239
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:28,279
But you can't help me
if you don't trust me.

240
00:17:28,489 --> 00:17:31,162
And you're in danger
as long as you're here.

241
00:17:32,129 --> 00:17:34,597
There's a market
a mile down the road.

242
00:17:36,449 --> 00:17:38,201
You'll never see me again,
I promise.

243
00:17:58,969 --> 00:18:00,687
Told you I never wanted to hurt you.

244
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:03,559
You just saved my life.

245
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:07,601
You think you can trust me now?

246
00:18:23,089 --> 00:18:25,557
- Tell me you're kidding.
- It's all over the news.

247
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,607
We called as soon as we saw
the first broadcast. Look.

248
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:30,322
I'm reporting live
from the county jail,

249
00:18:30,489 --> 00:18:32,878
where an inmate escaped
earlier this morning.

250
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:36,041
A massive manhunt has been
launched to find the escapee,

251
00:18:36,209 --> 00:18:38,200
a man by the name of Bane Jessup

252
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,161
who was awaiting trial
for racketeering,

253
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,360
money laundering
and embezzlement.

254
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:44,838
So much for keeping things quiet.
This is a nightmare.

255
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,524
- Welcome to our world.
- You want some aspirin?

256
00:18:48,089 --> 00:18:50,922
What I want is Prue safe,
Bane put in jail,

257
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:52,807
and nobody hurt by any...

258
00:18:55,209 --> 00:18:57,598
- Do you know what that is yet?
- We're still looking.

259
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:00,044
We do know
that Bane definitely kidnapped Prue.

260
00:19:00,249 --> 00:19:02,763
- Has he made contact with you?
- No, but she has.

261
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:06,398
It's a long story, but she's okay.

262
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:09,169
She said not to come looking for her.
She said it was a trap.

263
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:11,519
Did she say what kind?

264
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:15,364
Maybe this will help.

265
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:16,888
It's the DA's file on Bane.

266
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:20,161
It's all the information
they pulled together for his trials.

267
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:23,327
It's everything I could copy
before I got your phone call.

268
00:19:26,729 --> 00:19:28,401
Hello?

269
00:19:28,729 --> 00:19:30,128
Really?

270
00:19:30,329 --> 00:19:33,401
It's someone calling
for a Leonora Watkins.

271
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:37,319
Leonora Watkins. Isn't that weird?

272
00:19:38,489 --> 00:19:39,808
You have the wrong number.

273
00:19:42,129 --> 00:19:45,087
Anyway, we believe
that Bane is holed up somewhere.

274
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:47,519
Maybe there's something in there
that can tell you where.

275
00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:49,759
So, what the hell is he doing?

276
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:52,963
Oh, God,
I hope he's not hurting her.

277
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:57,046
Prue.

278
00:19:57,209 --> 00:19:59,677
If I'm gonna clean the wound,
then I have to stop the bleeding,

279
00:19:59,849 --> 00:20:01,168
I'm sorry.

280
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:02,842
Do you even know
what you're doing?

281
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:06,759
No, not really. But right now
I'm the only choice that you've got.

282
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:10,565
- So just try and hold still.
- That's easy for you to say.

283
00:20:10,729 --> 00:20:13,721
You don't have a set of fingernails
clawing into your body.

284
00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:17,279
Yeah, well, I'm almost done,
put this in your mouth or something.

285
00:20:18,329 --> 00:20:21,446
Forget about me, go home
before Litvack's man comes back.

286
00:20:21,849 --> 00:20:25,558
I told you, he's gone.
Probably ran right back to Litvack.

287
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:28,806
So now he knows about you too.
All the more reason to leave.

288
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:31,958
Yeah, well, as much
as I would like to, I can't.

289
00:20:34,449 --> 00:20:36,804
Not until I know that you're okay.

290
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:38,840
Besides, it's probably better
just to stay put.

291
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:41,882
I mean, now that we've been sighted,
they'll expect for us to take off.

292
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:45,762
Speaking of things
that need to be taken off,

293
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:48,238
your pants.

294
00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:55,165
- Excuse me?
- Well, I need to get to the wound.

295
00:20:56,609 --> 00:20:58,486
Forget it.

296
00:20:58,729 --> 00:21:00,765
Okay, you know what?
It's just gonna get infected.

297
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:03,318
So you can either
take your pants off on your own,

298
00:21:03,489 --> 00:21:06,128
or I can always do it by force.

299
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:22,438
I'm getting nowhere and everywhere.
How about you, any luck?

300
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:24,844
I'll give Bane this, he works hard.

301
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:28,524
Tax evasion, racketeering.
Pick a crime, any crime.

302
00:21:29,129 --> 00:21:32,804
I feel like we're looking right at
the answer, we're just not seeing it.

303
00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:34,078
Got good taste too.

304
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:36,160
There's a whole
money-laundering indictment here

305
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:37,802
based on a real-estate development.

306
00:21:38,489 --> 00:21:41,720
Exclusive custom homes.
They're really gorgeous.

307
00:21:41,889 --> 00:21:43,004
Check out the brochure.

308
00:21:43,889 --> 00:21:45,288
Mariner's Bluff.

309
00:21:47,249 --> 00:21:49,683
I'm sure the sea fairies
will be very happy here.

310
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:51,328
What did you say?

311
00:21:52,449 --> 00:21:55,839
Phoebe, what exactly
did your spell say?

312
00:21:56,009 --> 00:22:00,127
"I beseech all powers above
Send a sign to free my sister's heart

313
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:02,081
One that will lead her to her love"

314
00:22:02,249 --> 00:22:03,648
Why?

315
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:05,162
Because the Book of Shadows

316
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:07,797
specifically opened
to the Mariner section.

317
00:22:08,009 --> 00:22:11,319
What if the signs we're getting
have nothing to do with Dan and Leo

318
00:22:11,489 --> 00:22:13,127
and everything to do with Prue?

319
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:16,439
Where is Mariner's Bluff?

320
00:22:18,409 --> 00:22:19,444
Bodega Bay.

321
00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:22,758
Leonardo's Boutique of Bodega Bay.

322
00:22:22,969 --> 00:22:25,483
- Piper, I think you're right.
- Okay, so, what were the clues?

323
00:22:25,689 --> 00:22:28,806
Mariners, Bodega Bay,
Leonora Watkins.

324
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:30,920
Watkins Road exit.

325
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:33,159
So we've almost found her.
All we need is an address.

326
00:22:33,369 --> 00:22:35,519
What's this?

327
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,289
- Let's see.
- Are the lots numbered?

328
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:42,001
In an exhibition game last night,

329
00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:44,922
the Mariners lost to the Angels,
8 to 7.

330
00:22:45,129 --> 00:22:47,324
In other news, Sammy Sosa...

331
00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:51,408
Okay, now we're back to Dan and Leo.
Mariners, Angels.

332
00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:54,282
No, Phoebe, "8 to 7."

333
00:22:54,449 --> 00:22:56,565
Lot 827?

334
00:22:56,889 --> 00:22:59,005
Yes, there's an 827
at the top of the hill.

335
00:22:59,209 --> 00:23:00,483
I'll drive, you navigate.

336
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:10,520
Prue, why are you still here?

337
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:15,244
Because...

338
00:23:15,969 --> 00:23:17,368
...I believe you.

339
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:22,807
Well, thank you. It's been a long time
since someone believed in me.

340
00:23:23,689 --> 00:23:26,203
Maybe that's because
you stopped believing in yourself.

341
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:30,040
You know,
I haven't always been like this.

342
00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:34,279
The wrong side of the law,
always looking over my shoulder.

343
00:23:34,489 --> 00:23:37,083
I had dreams once.

344
00:23:37,609 --> 00:23:39,042
Big dreams.

345
00:23:41,649 --> 00:23:43,879
It's not too late to change, you know.

346
00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:47,566
Well, it's too late for me.
But not for you.

347
00:23:47,729 --> 00:23:51,517
So you should definitely go.
So you can still have your dreams.

348
00:23:51,689 --> 00:23:55,045
- Easier said than done.
- What do you mean?

349
00:23:55,729 --> 00:23:56,718
I don't know.

350
00:23:56,889 --> 00:24:01,644
I've just been thinking lately that
maybe dreams are just that, dreams.

351
00:24:02,729 --> 00:24:04,481
I don't believe that.

352
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,604
I'm sorry.

353
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,403
I'm not.

354
00:24:43,409 --> 00:24:45,400
Interesting.

355
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:48,604
I know. I screwed up.

356
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:51,484
Oblivion, right?

357
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:54,400
This is different.

358
00:24:54,609 --> 00:24:57,407
You weren't just up against a mortal.

359
00:24:57,809 --> 00:25:01,802
From what I saw,
you were also up against a witch.

360
00:25:02,449 --> 00:25:04,917
No excuse.
Hundreds of witches out there,

361
00:25:05,089 --> 00:25:07,045
I should be able
to handle one by myself.

362
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:10,204
This was different.

363
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:14,399
Powerful. Very powerful.

364
00:25:15,009 --> 00:25:17,318
Take me to
this mortal's dream house.

365
00:25:18,209 --> 00:25:21,758
Why? They gotta be
long gone by now.

366
00:25:22,209 --> 00:25:24,325
But their essence remains.

367
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:27,845
I'll need to tap into it
if I expect to reach their minds.

368
00:25:29,129 --> 00:25:32,485
Reach their minds? To what end?

369
00:25:33,329 --> 00:25:34,444
Theirs.

370
00:25:36,209 --> 00:25:38,359
The Source likes it
when I feed him witches.

371
00:25:42,089 --> 00:25:45,081
That's how I got to where I am.

372
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,279
Prue?

373
00:26:09,089 --> 00:26:10,886
Prue?

374
00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:15,326
Prue?

375
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:18,201
The view is amazing.

376
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:20,168
It's not as good as mine.

377
00:26:22,729 --> 00:26:24,560
I thought maybe you left.

378
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:28,002
No, I just couldn't really find
all of my clothes.

379
00:26:31,609 --> 00:26:34,567
Look, I'll help you with Litvack.

380
00:26:34,729 --> 00:26:38,722
You just have to promise me that you'll
turn yourself back in when it's all over.

381
00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:41,526
Bane.

382
00:26:41,849 --> 00:26:47,526
You know, I was thinking maybe this,
us, doesn't have to end.

383
00:26:48,129 --> 00:26:50,927
That maybe we can go somewhere
where we could be together,

384
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:54,240
get away from all this.
What do you say?

385
00:26:56,329 --> 00:26:59,605
I would say that you're beginning
to strike me as a dreamer.

386
00:27:06,569 --> 00:27:08,287
Bane.

387
00:27:08,489 --> 00:27:13,279
- Oh, my God.
- What are you guys doing here?

388
00:27:13,489 --> 00:27:16,606
We're rescuing you
from the tall, dark and naked man.

389
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:20,763
- I told you to stay away.
- Yeah, now I know why. He is yummy.

390
00:27:20,969 --> 00:27:22,880
I don't believe this.
We've been frantic,

391
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:25,643
worried sick about you,
thinking you've been kidnapped...

392
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:27,447
Yeah, I was.

393
00:27:27,609 --> 00:27:29,361
Panties.

394
00:27:32,489 --> 00:27:36,038
Thanks. Look, you guys
have really got this all...

395
00:27:37,609 --> 00:27:40,203
...wrong.
- Yeah, we know, it's a trap.

396
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:42,041
A tall, dark and naked trap.

397
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:44,606
All right, how did you two
find me anyway?

398
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:45,924
We'll explain that later.

399
00:27:46,089 --> 00:27:48,683
We really need to be going now
because there's a demon behind this.

400
00:27:48,889 --> 00:27:50,720
Yeah, Litvack.
Wait, how did you know?

401
00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:53,443
We have the weapon he used
to break Bane out of jail.

402
00:27:53,849 --> 00:27:58,479
No, no, no. He tried to kill Bane in jail,
not break him out.

403
00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:00,924
Or so Bane says.

404
00:28:01,129 --> 00:28:03,927
I believe him, because one of the
guys came here and tried to kill me.

405
00:28:04,129 --> 00:28:06,882
- All the more reason we should go.
- Fine, then just unfreeze him.

406
00:28:07,089 --> 00:28:08,363
You want us to bring him along?

407
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:11,118
Well, yeah. I mean,
I told him that I would help him.

408
00:28:11,329 --> 00:28:14,526
I can't leave him here when everything
I need to do is clearly at the manor.

409
00:28:19,929 --> 00:28:21,806
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

410
00:28:21,969 --> 00:28:25,484
Nice to see you again.
Why don't you put some clothes on?

411
00:28:34,889 --> 00:28:38,120
Listen, you guys have any peroxide
and stuff? I think I should clean this up.

412
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:40,880
Yeah, upstairs bathroom,
medicine cabinet.

413
00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:42,960
All right, thanks.

414
00:28:47,289 --> 00:28:50,167
First, I'd like to tell you
how relieved I am you're okay.

415
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:51,318
Me too.

416
00:28:51,489 --> 00:28:54,879
And second, I'd like to tell you that
you have completely lost your mind.

417
00:28:55,049 --> 00:28:56,960
Completely lost your mind.

418
00:28:57,129 --> 00:28:58,881
Okay. We have a demon to vanquish.

419
00:28:59,089 --> 00:29:00,317
You really wanna help him?

420
00:29:01,569 --> 00:29:05,687
Piper, past aside,
I know an innocent when I see one.

421
00:29:05,849 --> 00:29:06,918
And I trust him.

422
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:09,439
- Prue...
- Phoebe, I'm going to help him.

423
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:12,159
Think about this,
how well do you really know him?

424
00:29:12,369 --> 00:29:14,564
Regardless,
Litvack has to be vanquished

425
00:29:14,729 --> 00:29:16,924
whether Bane is on our side or not.

426
00:29:17,129 --> 00:29:20,360
It would be nice to know that
ahead of time. Minimize the surprises.

427
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:23,279
You really wanna minimize them?

428
00:29:23,449 --> 00:29:25,121
Help me find Litvack
in the Book of Shadows.

429
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:43,928
Hello, Bane. It's telepathic connection.

430
00:29:44,089 --> 00:29:46,478
I'm only in your mind.

431
00:29:49,569 --> 00:29:51,207
How did you find me?

432
00:29:51,369 --> 00:29:52,722
Your essence.

433
00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:56,638
This dream house of yours
reeks of it.

434
00:29:57,089 --> 00:30:01,207
It's a beautiful place. Too bad
you won't live long enough to enjoy it.

435
00:30:02,329 --> 00:30:05,924
- You don't scare me.
- Sure I do. I scare everybody.

436
00:30:06,129 --> 00:30:07,767
For good reason.

437
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,840
By the way,

438
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:13,523
your essence isn't the only one
I sense here.

439
00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:16,519
You bedded a witch.

440
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:20,398
And not just any witch,
one of the Charmed Ones.

441
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:23,167
My offer is simple.

442
00:30:23,369 --> 00:30:26,679
Your life in exchange for theirs.

443
00:30:27,849 --> 00:30:29,885
Screw you, Litvack.

444
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:33,762
You can't hide from me.

445
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:36,318
I can keep sending demons
after you for eternity,

446
00:30:36,489 --> 00:30:38,878
till one of them finally gets you.

447
00:30:40,609 --> 00:30:44,284
You know me, Bane,
better than you wish you did.

448
00:30:44,489 --> 00:30:47,208
I'm evil, just like you are.

449
00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:50,323
And you can't change that
no matter what you do,

450
00:30:50,529 --> 00:30:52,838
or who you sleep with.

451
00:30:53,009 --> 00:30:54,408
It's who you are.

452
00:30:57,129 --> 00:30:59,518
Bring me the witches,

453
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:02,369
and then bring me back
my weapon,

454
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:05,841
and I'll give you all your dreams.

455
00:31:08,849 --> 00:31:11,044
Bane, are you in there?

456
00:31:11,449 --> 00:31:15,442
Yeah. Yeah. I'll be right out.

457
00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:19,408
Hi.

458
00:31:19,969 --> 00:31:22,358
I thought that you had
skipped out on me or something.

459
00:31:22,569 --> 00:31:25,959
No, I was just washing up.

460
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:37,243
So is he gonna do it or not?

461
00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:42,481
I found Litvack in the Book,

462
00:31:42,649 --> 00:31:44,401
but there's nothing
about how to vanquish him.

463
00:31:44,609 --> 00:31:46,998
Maybe that means there isn't a way.

464
00:31:49,089 --> 00:31:51,159
Where there's a demon,
there's a way.

465
00:31:53,009 --> 00:31:55,523
Our jewellery better still be
where it's supposed to be.

466
00:31:57,289 --> 00:31:59,200
- We need to focus on Litvack.
- Do we?

467
00:31:59,369 --> 00:32:02,247
I mean, aside from the fact there's
nothing in the Book that can help us,

468
00:32:02,409 --> 00:32:04,047
maybe we should
just let bad enough alone.

469
00:32:04,209 --> 00:32:06,518
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about our lives.

470
00:32:06,689 --> 00:32:08,008
As in, saving them.

471
00:32:08,209 --> 00:32:10,120
This demon has powers
we don't know about.

472
00:32:10,289 --> 00:32:12,883
Why go up against him unprepared?
What's the rush?

473
00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:14,482
He doesn't know about us
or anything.

474
00:32:14,649 --> 00:32:16,207
Sure he does.

475
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:20,046
I mean, the demon he sent after us
saw Prue's power, right?

476
00:32:20,249 --> 00:32:21,443
You know he told Litvack.

477
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:24,609
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
that he knows about all three of us.

478
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,401
Look, all I'm saying
is he knows enough.

479
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,366
You don't go after him,
he comes after you.

480
00:32:29,609 --> 00:32:32,646
- How can you be sure?
- Because I know him, that's why.

481
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:34,288
Better than I wish I did.

482
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:37,320
Okay, still doesn't help us
vanquish him.

483
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:39,525
I just wish we knew
what his other powers were.

484
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:43,798
- You don't know what they are?
- No idea.

485
00:32:46,969 --> 00:32:48,482
You still have that weapon, right?

486
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:52,247
- Why?
- Might be your only hope.

487
00:32:52,449 --> 00:32:54,679
I thought only another demon
could activate it.

488
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:57,642
I got one to activate it before,
maybe I could do it again.

489
00:32:58,129 --> 00:33:00,848
Yeah, he's right. That's how
he took out the demon guard.

490
00:33:01,249 --> 00:33:02,318
So he says.

491
00:33:02,929 --> 00:33:04,760
- Do you think I'm lying?
- What do you think?

492
00:33:05,649 --> 00:33:07,799
I think I don't like
your implications, lady.

493
00:33:08,009 --> 00:33:10,477
I'm in this mess because Litvack
tried to off me, remember?

494
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:12,407
You don't trust me, fine.
I don't care.

495
00:33:12,609 --> 00:33:15,077
But trust this, I've had it
with all this supernatural crap,

496
00:33:15,249 --> 00:33:17,638
and I'll do anything I have to
to get out from underneath it.

497
00:33:18,369 --> 00:33:23,045
- That's what worries me.
- Okay, you know what? I trust him.

498
00:33:23,409 --> 00:33:26,242
And, please, I'm just asking
you guys to trust me.

499
00:33:26,449 --> 00:33:29,441
If we're going to get Litvack, then
we're gonna have to work together.

500
00:33:30,249 --> 00:33:33,878
With Bane.
Otherwise, we're all gonna be dead.

501
00:33:35,729 --> 00:33:39,119
Okay, Phoebe,
let's go get that weapon. Come on.

502
00:33:43,609 --> 00:33:47,522
- I don't really know what to say.
- You don't have to say anything.

503
00:33:47,689 --> 00:33:49,486
I'll be right back.

504
00:33:59,089 --> 00:34:00,647
We're on our way.

505
00:34:06,609 --> 00:34:08,918
He lives in a cemetery? How cliché.

506
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:11,967
Well, at least it's not
a warehouse again.

507
00:34:12,249 --> 00:34:15,286
Do we really think this is a good idea?
We don't really have a plan.

508
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:18,879
Yeah, sure we do. Bane goes in,
we follow, you freeze Litvack,

509
00:34:19,049 --> 00:34:20,846
we put the weapon in his hand,
turn it on him.

510
00:34:21,009 --> 00:34:23,045
- I mean, it's pretty simple.
- Still.

511
00:34:23,209 --> 00:34:24,847
Maybe you should
give me that weapon.

512
00:34:25,009 --> 00:34:26,078
Oh, I don't think so.

513
00:34:26,289 --> 00:34:28,007
Listen, the guy wants me dead,
remember?

514
00:34:28,209 --> 00:34:30,928
The only way for me to stay alive
long enough for our plan to work

515
00:34:31,129 --> 00:34:32,847
is to show him good faith.

516
00:34:33,049 --> 00:34:35,847
Double-crossing us shows some
pretty good faith too, don't you think?

517
00:34:36,049 --> 00:34:37,562
Pheebs, we've been through this.

518
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:39,600
Yeah, well,
it doesn't change my mind, Prue.

519
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:44,360
All right, give it to him.
We're either doing this or not.

520
00:34:45,809 --> 00:34:47,606
Thank you.

521
00:34:58,489 --> 00:35:00,923
You guys wait at the base of the steps
for my signal.

522
00:35:06,329 --> 00:35:08,126
Trust me.

523
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:15,079
I hope we're not making
a huge mistake.

524
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,880
Hello, Litvack.

525
00:35:36,289 --> 00:35:37,483
Well, well.

526
00:35:40,009 --> 00:35:42,045
I was wondering when
you were gonna show.

527
00:35:48,969 --> 00:35:50,402
Before you kill me...

528
00:35:53,649 --> 00:35:55,446
It's all right.

529
00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:04,288
I wanted to give you something,
hoping you would spare me.

530
00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:11,522
I'm afraid it's gonna take
much more than this.

531
00:36:11,889 --> 00:36:13,527
Now.

532
00:36:16,569 --> 00:36:20,039
- That was easy.
- A little too easy.

533
00:36:20,249 --> 00:36:22,638
Let's just get this over with.

534
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:30,527
He didn't freeze. He...
He didn't freeze.

535
00:36:31,129 --> 00:36:33,199
I'm immune
to the parlour tricks of witches.

536
00:36:34,049 --> 00:36:37,166
What's the matter?
Bane didn't tell you about that power?

537
00:36:37,569 --> 00:36:39,719
He said he didn't know.

538
00:36:40,689 --> 00:36:42,486
He knew.

539
00:36:42,649 --> 00:36:44,207
He just didn't tell you.

540
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:48,923
He showed his true colours.

541
00:36:49,089 --> 00:36:51,649
His true evil colours.

542
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:57,723
Prue, I just want you to know,
I am really pissed at you.

543
00:36:57,889 --> 00:37:00,483
No, no, wait. Something isn't right.

544
00:37:00,689 --> 00:37:03,328
This is gonna please The Source.

545
00:37:04,009 --> 00:37:05,920
Piper, unfreeze Bane.

546
00:37:06,129 --> 00:37:08,199
- Hurry.
- What?

547
00:37:12,969 --> 00:37:15,085
Tell The Source that we said hi.

548
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,202
Traitor.

549
00:37:32,689 --> 00:37:35,362
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

550
00:37:35,569 --> 00:37:36,638
What just happened here?

551
00:37:37,609 --> 00:37:41,079
Bane just saved our lives
is what happened.

552
00:37:41,289 --> 00:37:43,041
Are you saying this was
all part of the plan,

553
00:37:43,209 --> 00:37:45,165
to make it look like
you were double-crossing us?

554
00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:47,360
I had to. If I would've told you
about his power,

555
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:49,685
you would have come up
with a different plan of attack.

556
00:37:49,849 --> 00:37:52,522
And Litvack would have known it.
He's telepathic, remember.

557
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:55,038
So you had to believe
I double-crossed you,

558
00:37:55,209 --> 00:37:56,437
so he'd believe it too.

559
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,924
How did you know
Prue would figure it out in time?

560
00:37:59,529 --> 00:38:02,043
We trust each other.

561
00:38:11,529 --> 00:38:15,317
It's strange, isn't it,
being back where we started?

562
00:38:16,249 --> 00:38:19,639
What is stranger to me
is that I'm still here.

563
00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:21,208
I know.

564
00:38:21,409 --> 00:38:24,321
It was really good of you
to call Morris.

565
00:38:25,609 --> 00:38:28,362
I have to go back,
it's the right thing to do.

566
00:38:28,529 --> 00:38:30,918
Much as I'd prefer not to.

567
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:35,526
Listen, I don't know
how much time we have so...

568
00:38:36,409 --> 00:38:38,684
...I really want to apologize.
- Don't.

569
00:38:39,409 --> 00:38:41,240
I'm not sorry at all.

570
00:38:52,169 --> 00:38:54,683
This is really the awkward part,
you know?

571
00:38:54,889 --> 00:38:59,405
- Tell me about it.
- Well, next time I'll call first, huh?

572
00:39:03,569 --> 00:39:05,480
Thank you for saving my life.

573
00:39:06,609 --> 00:39:08,600
Thank you for changing mine.

574
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:36,524
What can I get for you?

575
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:41,242
So who do you think is The Source
that Litvack was talking about?

576
00:39:41,449 --> 00:39:44,759
I don't wanna know.
And, boy, did we read Bane wrong.

577
00:39:45,369 --> 00:39:47,599
Not surprising.
We read all the signs wrong.

578
00:39:47,809 --> 00:39:50,004
- Hey.
- Hey.

579
00:39:50,169 --> 00:39:51,238
How'd it go?

580
00:39:52,529 --> 00:39:55,919
Well, the cops came
and took him away a little while ago,

581
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:57,761
so everything's back as it should be.

582
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,328
Are you okay?

583
00:39:59,489 --> 00:40:02,799
I'm fine. He thanked me
for changing his life.

584
00:40:03,849 --> 00:40:05,441
You must have been a really good...

585
00:40:05,849 --> 00:40:10,365
- Influence on him.
- Yes, well, the influence was mutual.

586
00:40:10,529 --> 00:40:12,759
So how did you guys find me anyway?

587
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:18,407
I cast a little spell
to help Piper find her love.

588
00:40:18,609 --> 00:40:21,077
It was supposed to help her decide
between Dan and Leo.

589
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:24,804
But it led us to you.
Naked, I might add.

590
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:26,846
I want you to know
I tried to stop her.

591
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:30,280
Yeah, and you probably would've too,
if you weren't busy getting kidnapped.

592
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:34,723
Yeah. So, what was the outcome?
Dan or Leo?

593
00:40:37,529 --> 00:40:40,248
I never needed a sign
to tell me where my heart lies.
