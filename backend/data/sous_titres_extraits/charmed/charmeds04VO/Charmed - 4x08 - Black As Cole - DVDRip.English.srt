1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,518
Ademon who likes to kill witches.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,399
Well, that narrows it down to about
every page in the Book.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,393
We have one clue.
We know he likes to use an athame.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,916
- How does that help?
- Well, it means he has hands.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,672
Keep flipping.

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,274
So I hear you and Leo are thinking
about having a baby.

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,954
Where did you hear that from?

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,358
From Phoebe.

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,034
Oh, did I just break some sort
of sister confidentiality clause?

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,989
- No, you didn't. And, no, we aren't.
- Really?

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,114
Don't you want to? Not to be nosy,
but if I'm gonna be an aunt and all...

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,749
You're not gonna be an aunt, all right.

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,309
At least not any time soon.
It's too risky.

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,710
It would be in constant
danger around us.

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,069
What does Leo think?

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,674
Leo thinks that there's
enough magic around here

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,319
we'd be able to protect it.

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,909
Maybe he's right.

19
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,275
Maybe he's not. Keep flipping.

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,154
I'm flipping.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,673
You know, it's not like having a baby
isn't hard enough.

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,068
Even without demons attacking.

23
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,229
But for what it's worth,

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,278
there are ways of seeing what it's
like before you actually have one.

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,915
Great. Well, the next time you pass a
baby-rental, pick one up for Leo.

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,314
Maybe I will.

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,428
So did you find anything out?

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,836
Yeah. I scried for the location
of the demon,

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,638
using the slime from the last victim.

30
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,233
And Phoebe and Cole
are checking it out.

31
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,919
All right, I hope that it pans out

32
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,389
because with two dead witches,
they're pretty concerned up there.

33
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,949
Okay, well, we are very
concerned down here too.

34
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,348
Hey, I think I got something.

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,871
Upper-level demon who likes to
kill witches using an athame.

36
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,917
Sometimes energy balls.

37
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,953
His name is Belthazor.

38
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,839
I don't think so.

39
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,429
Why not?

40
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,197
Well, because that's Cole
in his demonic form.

41
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,678
You knew he was half demon.

42
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,551
Yeah, but I didn't know
he could turn into that.

43
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,069
Hello?

44
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,710
We're at Battery and Clay,
but there's no sign of any demons.

45
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,192
Okay, I'll scry for him again.
Talk to Paige.

46
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,395
Hi, Phoebe.

47
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,312
How's Cole?

48
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,040
- Morphed into any demons lately?
- What?

49
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,394
Paige.

50
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,870
Battery and Clay. He's still there.

51
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,155
Piper says he's still there.

52
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,072
Piper says he's still here somewhere.

53
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,518
- Hold on!
- No, I can't!

54
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,588
Three. Two. One!

55
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,316
We have to stop meeting like this.

56
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,549
- Marry me.
- What?

57
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,439
Don't you think we should
talk about this?

58
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,238
Talk about what?

59
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,436
Wow, looks like you
two got a juicy one.

60
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,830
Yeah, but unfortunately not the
one who kills witches.

61
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,435
How do you know?

62
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,919
Upper-level demons
have a human form,

63
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,150
and they bleed red, not green.

64
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,632
- Where are you going?
- I'm going up to take a shower first,

65
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,597
and then I'm gonna check out
the Book of Shadows.

66
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,911
I wanna lD this demon that I'm
wearing, try to find some answers.

67
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,559
Speaking of unanswered questions--

68
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,678
There is a demon on the loose, Cole.
We don't have time for this.

69
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,434
- Shouldn't we make time for it?
- No. Not now we shouldn't.

70
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,034
- What are you guys talking about?
- Nothing.

71
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,031
Nothing.

72
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,877
Please, Cole, let's just focus
on vanquishing the demon.

73
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,318
Fine. I'll go see what I can find out.

74
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,112
Honey, did you two have a fight?

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,877
No, he just...

76
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,471
Never mind.

77
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,519
Witch.

78
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,873
You're next.

79
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,959
Yes, I'd like to report
a terrible murder.

80
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,192
A beautiful young woman in the alley
behind the Cannon Theater.

81
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,679
Hey, are you gonna be long?

82
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,558
What, are you deaf?
I need to use the phone.

83
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,549
Hold on.

84
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,037
Hurry, please.
Before anyone else gets hurt.

85
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,750
Okay, so the demon that Cole and l
nailed is a scavenger demon.

86
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,559
Apparently, he feeds on the remains
of other demons' victims.

87
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,789
Nice, huh?

88
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,270
Well, that explains why we
scried for him accidentally.

89
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,874
Are you gonna tell me
what happened out there?

90
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,519
Well, there's not much to tell.

91
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,989
I mean, the demon jumped
in behind us, and we--

92
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,958
That's not what I mean.

93
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,634
What happened
between you and Cole?

94
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,513
Oh, yeah, that.

95
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,752
I'm not exactly sure.

96
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,319
He asked me to marry him.

97
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,632
What? He did what? He did?

98
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,871
More or less.

99
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,235
- Well, what did you say?
- I didn't know what to say.

100
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,628
I was too surprised.

101
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,793
I mean, all my power of premonition,
and I never saw that one coming.

102
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,671
I don't think a witch
is allowed to marry a demon.

103
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,434
Honey, we can't have
a demon in the family.

104
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,637
Piper, that is the least
of my concerns right now.

105
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,153
Well, don't kid yourself.

106
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,551
If you decide to
go through with this,

107
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,995
it's gonna be a source of huge
concerns, especially for them.

108
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,277
I have to be concerned
with my own concerns, you know.

109
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,239
I love Cole.

110
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,913
You know I do.

111
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,791
But demon stuff aside, I just never
thought of myself as the marrying type.

112
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,951
You know, it's not something
I fantasized about.

113
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,109
Ever.

114
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,032
So then, what are
you gonna tell him?

115
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,474
I don't know.

116
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,872
Well, you have to
tell him something

117
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,759
because a question like that
just doesn't go away by itself.

118
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,480
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

119
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,716
- Hey.
- Hey.

120
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,949
I'll...

121
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,156
...be downstairs.

122
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,033
I couldn't find out who the demon is.

123
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,760
But at least I ruled out
the usual suspects.

124
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,512
Any idea of who it could be?

125
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,070
No, just another upper-level demon
trying to build a reputation

126
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,117
by killing witches
to move up the ladder.

127
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,195
Anyway, I guess I'll keep checking.

128
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,678
No, Cole, wait.

129
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,872
- We should talk.
- All right.

130
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,511
It's just hard.

131
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,153
It's just me.

132
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,353
Okay.

133
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,590
Let me ask you a question.

134
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,875
When you...

135
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,715
...you know, proposed...

136
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,713
...did you mean to?

137
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,476
Or did it just come out in
the heat of the moment?

138
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,509
Well, does that matter?

139
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,839
Well, yeah, it matters to me.

140
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,398
It just came out in the heat
of the moment.

141
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,313
But that doesn't mean that once I said
it I wasn't serious, because I was.

142
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,469
I still am.

143
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,195
Cole.

144
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,032
Phoebe, listen to me.

145
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,233
I know it was crazy to ask.

146
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:42,589
And I know it doesn't make any sense
because of who we are, but...

147
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,311
That shouldn't matter.

148
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,717
If it did, we never would have
fallen in love in the first place.

149
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,109
I love you, Phoebe.

150
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,717
And I don't know where
we go from here,

151
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,792
but I do know that wherever it is...

152
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,278
... I want it to be with you.

153
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,509
Is that a baby crying?

154
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,556
You told me to rent one.
So I did.

155
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,756
Well, I didn't think that you could.

156
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,955
Where did you get it?

157
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,475
- The clinic.
- Great. Take it back.

158
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,790
What's going on?

159
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,473
Piper and Leo wanted
to try out having

160
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,914
a baby before
actually having one.

161
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,991
So I got them a mechanical baby.

162
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,991
We use them in parenting classes
all the time.

163
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,198
- Wow, it sounds so real.
- And so annoying.

164
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,713
Look, Paige,

165
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,313
I appreciate the thought,

166
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,469
but we are on a demon hunt.

167
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,313
And the last thing I want to do is
protect a fake baby.

168
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,152
Oh, really?

169
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,232
See, your instincts were to save it.

170
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,516
My instincts were to shut it up.

171
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,672
The doll has a sensor.
It'll stop crying if you just hold it.

172
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,875
But I don't want to.

173
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,234
Come on. Just try it.

174
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,994
If it doesn't work,
I will take it back. I promise.

175
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,869
Okay, now you just rock it gently.

176
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,155
Phoebe.

177
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,754
I know how to hold a baby.
That is not the issue. Thank you.

178
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,149
Just give it a shot.

179
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,594
What have you got to lose?

180
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,548
Another witch has been killed.

181
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,314
- Oh, no.
- The police found her body

182
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,469
behind the Cannon Theater.

183
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,074
We should go there
and see what we can find out.

184
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,559
We gotta call Morris on the way.

185
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,835
Make sure he can get us in.

186
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,353
And no, you cannot come.

187
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,671
Someone might recognize you
from when you posed as a DA.

188
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,558
I don't get to go anywhere anymore.

189
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,671
You were a demon and a lawyer?

190
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,909
Insert joke here.

191
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,793
Where did you get it?

192
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,520
- It's Paige's.
- No, it's yours.

193
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,240
You need to figure it out.

194
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,870
Yeah, Daddy, figure it out.

195
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,519
Excuse me.

196
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,392
Don't look at me.

197
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,519
I can't guarantee you
much time on this.

198
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,033
Promise me you'll stay on the fringe.

199
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,633
We promise.

200
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,279
So, what do we know?

201
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,637
A man called 91 1 from that pay phone
and reported he found a body.

202
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,998
Looks like she wasn't the only victim.

203
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,153
Scorch mark. Definitely demonic.

204
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,788
Looks like one of Cole's, actually.

205
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,188
Don't you mean Belthazor?

206
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,636
It's too bad Cole can't check it out.

207
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,234
Probably be able to tell us who did it.

208
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,436
Is anyone from the DA's office here?

209
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,874
Yeah, that guy over there is an ADA.

210
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,632
He's interviewing
a friend of the victim.

211
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,348
I also found this on the victim.

212
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,629
A triple crescent.

213
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,355
Does this mean something to you?

214
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,953
I studied it in one of Piper's quizzes.

215
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,918
It's an ancient Wiccan symbol.
A cousin to the triquetra.

216
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,274
Could be the mark of a coven.

217
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,919
A coven someone's trying
to wipe out.

218
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,679
We have to figure out
who else is in it.

219
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,035
Maybe the victim's friend.

220
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,040
- Only one way to find out.
- Phoebe.

221
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,954
- Fringe, okay?
- Fringe.

222
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,113
And she hadn't complained about
any disgruntled friends, coworkers,

223
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,510
- ex-boyfriends?
- No.

224
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,353
Kari was a beautiful person.

225
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,397
Everyone loved her.

226
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,990
If you can think of anything else at all,
please, don't hesitate to call.

227
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,034
I like your necklace.

228
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,989
Do I know you?

229
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,149
No.

230
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,833
But you might know of me

231
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,752
and my sisters.

232
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,113
The Charmed Ones.

233
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,992
You and Kari were
in the same coven?

234
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,429
Yes.

235
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,353
And your mark is the triple crescent.

236
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,389
What is it? Are you all right?

237
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,155
What happened? What'd you see?

238
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,992
The demon. He's after her.

239
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,032
- Where?
- By the steps

240
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,269
in some park.

241
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,431
I think it was like
an old amphitheatre or something.

242
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,272
I know that.
That's in Stanley Arboretum.

243
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,953
I walk past it every day
going to work.

244
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,473
What did the demon look like?

245
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,038
Like Belthazor.

246
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,076
I mean, not exactly like him.
Just similar.

247
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,634
What the hell is going on here?

248
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,719
This is a murder investigation.

249
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,869
Who are these people?

250
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,314
I'll get rid of them.

251
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,392
Come on, ladies, move along.
First time I ask nicely.

252
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,671
We're going, mister.

253
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,673
I don't understand. If you know
the demon is meant to attack here,

254
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,068
shouldn't we go someplace else?

255
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,037
Not if we want to
get rid of him for good.

256
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,235
Power of three spell?

257
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,994
No, the only way to vanquish
an upper-level demon

258
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,798
is with a potion of his own flesh.

259
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,279
Sounds like you've done this before.

260
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,908
Once, on my fiancé.

261
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,354
Your fiancé?

262
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,431
Yeah, I just wanted to hear
how it sounded.

263
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,033
- And...?
- Kind of weird.

264
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,349
- Yeah.
- Wait. Back up.

265
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,112
Did you say you once tried
to vanquish Cole?

266
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,998
No, Belthazor. There's a difference.

267
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,310
- Is there?
- Okay, let's review.

268
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,948
I play decoy. Demon attacks.

269
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,588
Piper freezes. You slice and dice
until we get the demon sushi.

270
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,910
And then we get out of there.
Everybody ready?

271
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,519
As ready as I'll ever be.

272
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,432
Okay, I'm gonna need
your coat and your hat.

273
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,669
And your necklace.

274
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,959
Okay, we gotta get Susan
someplace safe. Leo!

275
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,960
Hi, honey. Could you
orb Susan out of here?

276
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,712
Sure. Any place in mind?

277
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,677
I don't think home is a good idea.

278
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,274
You should take her to my old loft.
I don't think it's rented yet.

279
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,317
All right, take my hand.

280
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,799
Where's the baby?

281
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,549
See? We can make this work.

282
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,274
Go away, and you drop
Robo-kid off at the manor.

283
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,998
Please. Thank you.

284
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,792
Okay, we gotta do this fast

285
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,349
because this demon won't
stay frozen for long. Ready?

286
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,269
Let's go.

287
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,799
Hello, witch.

288
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,234
Goodbye...

289
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,709
...demon.

290
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,469
I had him.

291
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,316
Who the hell are you?

292
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,837
He used this to kill my fiancé.

293
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,433
It's a ceremonial knife.

294
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,272
The demon left it behind
after the struggle.

295
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,431
I've been hunting him down
for the last year and a half.

296
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,192
It's all I care about.

297
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,476
May l?

298
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,348
Look familiar?

299
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,038
- He looked familiar to me.
- I meant the athame.

300
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,474
It's one used by the Brotherhood.

301
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,438
Emma, do you know why the demon
wanted to kill your fiancé?

302
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,352
Because Andrew was a witch.

303
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,078
- Are you a witch too?
- No.

304
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,312
But after Andrew died, I studied his
books and devoted myself to the craft.

305
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,072
To continue his work?

306
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,992
To track down his killer.

307
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,434
You happened to be it in the park

308
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,352
the same time the demon
was going to attack Susan?

309
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,509
I know his m.o.

310
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,116
I know when he kills a witch
he goes after the entire coven.

311
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,112
You've taught yourself well.

312
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,113
But still, if we hadn't come along,
we would have lost you both.

313
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,554
Vengeance empowers me.

314
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,149
But it won't save you.

315
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,710
Your desire for revenge
is keeping you from the truth.

316
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,035
You want the demon vanquished,

317
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,270
you should stand back and let
the Charmed Ones handle it.

318
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,429
This is my fight.

319
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,999
Then you shall lose it.

320
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,435
Cole's right.

321
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,953
You have to trust us.

322
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,951
Trust that we want
the same thing you do.

323
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,152
It's just--

324
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,798
His face has haunted me
ever since Andrew died.

325
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,993
It's the face of pure evil.

326
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,517
I can't let him get away.

327
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,514
Why don't you scry for him again while
we prepare the vanquishing potion.

328
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,750
Once we get a piece
of his flesh, he's dust.

329
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,269
We'll get him.

330
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,953
I swear we'll get him.

331
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,309
Ignore that.

332
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,989
Piper.

333
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,998
All right. Excuse me.

334
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,435
She has a baby?

335
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,114
Actually, she's not sure yet.

336
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,190
Inspector Morris,
he's based downtown.

337
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,952
I want you to get in touch
with his captain.

338
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,634
And you tell him my office wants
to see all of his recent case files.

339
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,789
Got it.

340
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,757
In fact, better go make
that request in person.

341
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,911
This way, they can't
duck you on the phone.

342
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,399
I'll be back as soon as I can.

343
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,676
That's okay. Take your time.

344
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,314
I'm gonna lure the witch here.

345
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,074
I'm gonna need you to stand guard

346
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,719
in case the ones who
ambushed me show up.

347
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,869
You understand?

348
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,117
Fortunately, they won't recognize
me in my human form.

349
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,078
Your old boss, Belthazor,
he was right about one thing.

350
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,673
Posing as a DA is perfect cover.

351
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,309
Leave me.

352
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,914
How much longer do you think
I'll have to stay here?

353
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,399
Well, I'll talk to your whitelighter.

354
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,312
My instincts tell me that everyone
in your coven

355
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,789
should break their routine
until this threat is over.

356
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,678
Excuse me.

357
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,829
Hello?

358
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,468
Miss Coleman, this is the
assistant district attorney Sykes.

359
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,149
- Who is it?
- ADA.

360
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,639
I'm sorry. Yes, hi.

361
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,518
I'm calling because I've received
new evidence.

362
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,591
I'd like to talk to you about it
if that's all right.

363
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,352
Okay, when?

364
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,158
Can you come over
to the offiice now?

365
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,153
- He wants me to come in.
- Okay.

366
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,673
All right, I'll be right there.

367
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,397
I'll be waiting.

368
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,034
I feel the crystal pulling.
He's still in the area.

369
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,475
I can't find him in the Book anywhere.

370
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,473
Did you notice how he vanished?
Did he smoke out? Flame out?

371
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,111
Actually he shimmered like Belthazor.

372
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,635
- I think I found him.
- Where?

373
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,236
- He's at Prescott and--
- Pine.

374
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,154
How did you know?

375
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,113
That's where we are.

376
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,954
Wait, he's here in the house?

377
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,953
I'll go check upstairs.
You find your sisters, get ready.

378
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,631
Hello?

379
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,598
Miss Coleman. Who's this?

380
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,995
I'm a friend.

381
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,189
Is it a problem?

382
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,430
No, no. No problem at all.

383
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,595
Why don't you just wait over there,
and I'll let you know when it's over.

384
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,552
Right this way.

385
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,879
Phoebe.

386
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,116
- He's not upstairs.
- Not downstairs either.

387
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,349
It's the ADA.

388
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,919
- Sykes?
- He tried to kill her.

389
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,638
I don't know if
he followed us here or not.

390
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,835
Watch out!

391
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,991
Take her upstairs.

392
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,592
You're gonna have to do
better than that.

393
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,109
Hurry, slice him.

394
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,511
Oh, Paige, just do it.
This is no time to be squeamish.

395
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,635
Got it.

396
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,195
Oh, my God.

397
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,119
Belthazor, we meet at last.

398
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,315
But not for long.

399
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,638
We'll finish this later.

400
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,676
Is everybody okay?

401
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,034
I'm okay.

402
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,549
Emma?

403
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,910
He's not the demon
who killed my fiancé.

404
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,309
He is.

405
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,954
He's a killer! What is
the matter with you people?

406
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,190
Emma, I know you're upset.
But you don't understand.

407
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,999
- Let go of me.
- You're making a huge mistake.

408
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,479
He's not who you think he is.

409
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,473
He's the demon who killed my fiancé,
and that is all I need to know.

410
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,749
Hey!

411
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,632
How can you protect a murderer?

412
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,113
How can you live with yourself?

413
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,039
Is she right?
Are you the one who killed him?

414
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,558
Honey, now is not the time.
We have to worry about Sykes.

415
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,709
We got what we need.

416
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,518
You guys work on
the vanquishing potion.

417
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,197
We need to talk.

418
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,831
Don't tell me you're scared of me.

419
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,954
No, don't be ridiculous.

420
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,873
That's good.

421
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,430
Because I think Emma's right.

422
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,472
I am the one who killed her fiancé.
This is mine.

423
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,674
I don't even remember doing it.

424
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,873
I don't even remember
what he looked like.

425
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,394
Didn't matter what they looked like.

426
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,278
It only mattered
that I did what I was told.

427
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,469
He was a witch.
The Source viewed him as a threat.

428
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,792
You don't have to explain
yourself to me.

429
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,235
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

430
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,038
I know who you were.

431
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,553
Who you used to be.

432
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,631
And that's not the person
you are anymore.

433
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,839
Aren't l?

434
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,877
Belthazor still exists inside of me.

435
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,918
That hasn't changed,
nor does it change what I've done.

436
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,837
But just think of all the good
you've done since then.

437
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,871
Doesn't balance out.

438
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,356
Doesn't even come close.

439
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,349
And now the very thing
I've been trying so hard not to be

440
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,114
is the very thing
I might have to become.

441
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,589
What do you mean?

442
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,949
Sykes has done a good job
of emulating me, emulating Belthazor,

443
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,634
which means,
if the potion doesn't work,

444
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,519
the only way to destroy him
is for me to turn into Belthazor.

445
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,312
Yeah, but then afterwards
you'll turn back into Cole.

446
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,272
I may not be able to.

447
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,829
To stop him, I'll have to embrace
my demonic self completely.

448
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,356
There may be no coming back
from that.

449
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:19,039
Well, then we'll just have to make sure
that potion works very well.

450
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,394
Won't we?

451
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,754
I'll be back.

452
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,751
- Where are you going?
- To find Emma.

453
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,239
Try to explain.

454
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,674
It won't make any difference.

455
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,909
Well, it will if I can keep her
out of the craziness.

456
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,354
Keep her from getting hurt.

457
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,832
I'm more concerned with keeping you
out of the craziness.

458
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,115
Keeping you from getting hurt.

459
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,397
You still have some of that Belthazor
vanquishing potion left, don't you?

460
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,949
- Yes, but--
- Get it.

461
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,189
Just in case.

462
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,030
It might be the only way to stop me.

463
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,595
Okay, we just need the pigs' feet
over there by the mandrake root.

464
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,671
Poor piggy, piggy.

465
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,115
They're sensitive creatures, you know.

466
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,238
- Smart too.
- Yeah, not that one.

467
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:31,709
Okay, so all we need to do
is drop in the Sykes' flesh.

468
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,636
Go ahead. Just drop it in.

469
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,558
- You did that on purpose, didn't you?
- Yeah.

470
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,076
Yeah, it happened to me last year.

471
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,595
No substitute for experience.

472
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,318
- You girls all right?
- Yeah.

473
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,471
We were just doing a little
sisterly bonding, that's all.

474
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,629
Where's Phoebe?

475
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,836
The potion will be ready
in a couple of minutes.

476
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,912
Yeah, she wanted to talk to Emma,
explain things.

477
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,798
Good luck.

478
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,792
Look, I don't need
the guilt from you, okay?

479
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,473
I've got enough of my own
to deal with.

480
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,631
What, and you think that covers it?
What you did?

481
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,994
Paige, don't.

482
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,833
Don't what, Piper? He killed a man.
Are you condoning that?

483
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,230
No, of course not.
But it's just not that simple.

484
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,674
He can't change the past.

485
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,558
And you've seen how much good
he's helped us do.

486
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,029
That's who he is now.
And we accept that.

487
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,996
Well, if you say so.

488
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,509
Thank you.

489
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,639
- You want me to help you find Sykes?
- Can you?

490
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,712
If he's still emulating me, all I have
to do is figure out what I'd do next.

491
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,029
Which would be?

492
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,553
Go after the Charmed Ones.

493
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,709
Oh, that's nice.

494
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,632
But first I'd have to
regroup somewhere.

495
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,711
- Tend to my cut.
- The mausoleum?

496
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,836
Except Sykes will anticipate that.

497
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,479
He'll be expecting you
to come after him,

498
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,756
which means he'll probably
be lying in wait.

499
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,399
Maybe even set some kind of trap.

500
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,039
One that you could identify.

501
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,391
So let's go.

502
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,792
Wait, don't we need Phoebe?

503
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,359
No, all we need is this.

504
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,715
Besides, it's better to keep Emma
away from the action.

505
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,272
Oh, honey, what happened?

506
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,037
Sykes. Guess you were right.

507
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,350
Sweetie, I didn't want to be right.

508
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,669
I'm sorry.

509
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,035
You're sorry?
Who's gonna pay for this?

510
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,469
Well?

511
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,755
We're gonna go after Sykes,

512
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,356
so you should probably orb Susan
out of here, just to be safe.

513
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,919
Emma.

514
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,559
Emma, please, I need to talk to you.

515
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,718
Look, I know that
there's nothing I can say

516
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,359
that can change what happened.

517
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,397
But I think there is something
that may help.

518
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,593
I want you to know that Cole has
dedicated his life to good now.

519
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,514
And I'm not saying that
it excuses what he did.

520
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,669
Damn right, it doesn't.

521
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,276
All I'm saying is the demon
you're searching for no longer exists.

522
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,953
Oh, my God.

523
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,599
Who are you trying to kid?

524
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,875
Are you blind?

525
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,837
Did you not see what he turned into?

526
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,194
That monster still exists,

527
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,396
whether you want to believe it or not.

528
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,835
- Technically, yes, but--
- Not technically.

529
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,109
Actually.

530
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,269
He's alive.

531
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,749
And I'm not gonna rest until he's dead,
no matter what you say.

532
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,315
All that would do is keep him
from doing future good

533
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,075
and put your life at risk
in the process.

534
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,835
Emma, please, please, let it go.

535
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,238
Let it go?

536
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,270
Have you ever lost someone?

537
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,793
To evil, I mean.

538
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,269
Yes.

539
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,556
And did you just...

540
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,194
...Iet it go?

541
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,277
Any sign of him?

542
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,233
What?

543
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,833
Trap. Back up.

544
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,758
Where is he?

545
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,195
I don't know.

546
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,396
Well, why would he set a trap for us
and not be here?

547
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,351
Unless this is just a distraction.

548
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,273
What do you mean, "distraction"?
You said he was after us.

549
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,149
I was wrong. He's after me.

550
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,913
The best way to get to me
is through--

551
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,149
Phoebe.

552
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,358
Cole?

553
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,034
Close.

554
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,269
What do you want?

555
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,069
The same thing you do.
Only I call him Belthazor.

556
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,828
Except I don't need a potion
to vanquish him.

557
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,310
I just need you.

558
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,553
Phoebe.

559
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,598
I'll check upstairs.
You check downstairs.

560
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,837
You must be
something very special.

561
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,911
Turn a demon.

562
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,159
Something very special indeed.

563
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,192
Unfortunately, though,
when you made him less evil,

564
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,635
you made him less powerful.

565
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,158
I wonder.

566
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,997
You gonna have the same effect
on me after I kill him?

567
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,954
Well, well, well.

568
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,758
The mighty Belthazor.

569
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,069
You don't disappoint.

570
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,754
I knew you'd figure out
what I was up to.

571
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,717
Sooner or later.

572
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,238
Cole, get out of here.

573
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,391
He won't hurt me. He's bluffing.

574
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,551
- I can't take that chance.
- I can't take that chance.

575
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,279
It's kind of eerie, isn't it?

576
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,359
How I know you better than
you know yourself.

577
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,193
The student has surpassed
his mentor.

578
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,112
I was never your mentor, Sykes.

579
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,508
By reputation you were.

580
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,349
By your legend.

581
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,154
It'll be an honour to kill you

582
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,517
and assume your rightful place
in the hierarchy.

583
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,956
You remember what I told you?

584
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,155
What I asked you to do?

585
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,548
Cole, please don't.

586
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,958
Did you hear that?

587
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,110
- Die!
- Cole.

588
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,112
Cole.

589
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,350
It's over. You can turn back now.

590
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,279
Cole, you can do it.

591
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,317
For me. For us.

592
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,872
Hurry, throw the potion.
Maybe it'll work on him.

593
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,953
No, don't. Cole, please.
You can do this. You're good.

594
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,469
What happened?

595
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,276
That was the power-stripping potion
I made to free Cole.

596
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,309
Are you okay?

597
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,558
No!

598
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,515
You got your revenge.

599
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,757
You killed the demon you were after.

600
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,432
Belthazor is dead, gone forever.

601
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,833
Cole's a human being.

602
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,871
An innocent.

603
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,358
You know, this baby was your idea.

604
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,592
I know, I know.
That's why I'm paying for half of it.

605
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,035
Still haven't quite figured out

606
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,953
how I'm gonna explain
what happened to it, though.

607
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,713
- Thank you.
- Well, at least it served its purpose.

608
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,438
In spades, unfortunately.

609
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,280
Oh, honey, it doesn't mean
that we can't ever have children.

610
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,556
Just, you know,
we have to wait till it's safe.

611
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,551
Promise?

612
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,478
Promise.

613
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,792
That's sweet.
You two ought to get married.

614
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,712
Unlike Phoebe and Cole.

615
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,513
You don't think they should?

616
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,069
I don't know.
I guess it's not my business.

617
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,959
Probably just reeling from the fact
that Cole killed people.

618
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,429
Yeah, but that wasn't Cole.
It was Belthazor.

619
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,799
Splitting hairs, if you ask me.

620
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,518
It's not, though.

621
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,955
His human half had absolutely
nothing to do with any of that.

622
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,917
It was totally subjugated.

623
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,672
Phoebe's right. He's an innocent.

624
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,071
The question is,
what does he do now?

625
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,791
Cole. Oh, my God, I was so worried.

626
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,516
Oh, I'm sorry. I just...
I had to take a walk.

627
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,796
And I lost track of time.

628
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,872
And I tried to shimmer back here,
and I realized l...

629
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,951
I didn't have my powers anymore.

630
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,119
But that's a good thing.

631
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,633
Isn't that what we always wanted?

632
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,079
I don't know. Did we?

633
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,596
I mean, I get it that
I'm finally off The Source's radar

634
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,273
and that I don't have to
worry about demons

635
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,749
tracking me down all the time, but...

636
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,589
I'm grateful for that,
don't get me wrong. It's just...

637
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,789
What?

638
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,431
Come here.

639
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,558
Phoebe.

640
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,078
For all intents and purposes,
I've been a demon for...

641
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,912
...over 1 00 years.
It's all I've ever known.

642
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,559
Or been.

643
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,711
What am I supposed to do now?

644
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,393
Who am l?

645
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,032
You're still the good man
that I fell in love with.

646
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,750
But not the one you want to marry.

647
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,791
I love you, Cole.

648
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,272
And nothing will ever change that.

649
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,991
But I'm not ready.

650
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,149
Not yet.

651
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,677
And that's got more to do
with me and my issues

652
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,875
than it does you.

653
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,388
I still don't know where that
leaves us, especially now.

654
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,029
Well, just because
you're not a demon anymore,

655
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,715
doesn't mean we can't live in sin.
