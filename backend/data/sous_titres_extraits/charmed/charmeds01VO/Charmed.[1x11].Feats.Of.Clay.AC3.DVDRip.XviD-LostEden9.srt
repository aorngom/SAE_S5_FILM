1
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,824
- Told you. Piece of cake.
- Let's just do this and get out of here.

2
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:36,244
Relax, Clay. I told you
no one's home. The owner's dead.

3
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,915
Stay here. Keep watch.
We'll get the urn.

4
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,713
- Clay doesn't know, does he?
- Why spook him?

5
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,132
He'd believe it was the curse
that killed the old man.

6
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,384
He was stung to death
by a scorpion, Wesley,

7
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,011
in the bathroom of an aeroplane.

8
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:57,849
- Don't tell me you believe in that crap.
- You think I'd be here if I did?

9
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,311
Is that it?

10
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,438
That's it.

11
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:10,445
- You see any scorpions around?
- No, just dollar signs.

12
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,489
- Let's go.
- Hey, there's a car coming.

13
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,742
- You guys must've tripped an alarm.
- Let's get out of here.

14
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:27,920
I should've never let you guys
talk me into this.

15
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:30,298
Shut up. We'll split up
and meet in San Francisco.

16
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,383
Take this to your friend
and hock it right away.

17
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,345
And don't you think about ripping
us off, because I'll find you.

18
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:46,189
What? What...?

19
00:01:47,356 --> 00:01:49,775
What are you?

20
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:53,446
- I'm The Guardian of the urn.
- The what?

21
00:01:55,781 --> 00:01:58,200
Hey, what are you doing?

22
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,500
You're being punished
for your greed.

23
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,173
As for your friends...

24
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,685
- New York Clay? That Clay?
- That's the one.

25
00:02:24,852 --> 00:02:26,604
You said you never wanted
to see him again.

26
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,314
- Ancient history.
- Six months?

27
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,734
Five. He's just stopping by
on his way home. It's not a big deal.

28
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,152
He was travelling or something.

29
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,570
- Who's Clay?
- Nobody.

30
00:02:34,778 --> 00:02:36,238
Her ex-boyfriend. The musician.

31
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:39,283
She met him when she was working
at the Rainbow Room. You remember.

32
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,244
No, I don't. Nobody told me.
They hired you at the Rainbow Room?

33
00:02:42,411 --> 00:02:45,414
Yeah, she was a hostess until she
started working at the Chelsea Pier.

34
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:48,667
Okay, can we talk about this
later please?

35
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:50,502
A lot later.

36
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:52,880
We're just friends.
That's all, you know.

37
00:02:53,046 --> 00:02:55,549
- Do I have lipstick on my teeth?
- Yes.

38
00:02:57,134 --> 00:02:58,427
That was mean.

39
00:02:58,594 --> 00:02:59,928
- That was not mean.
- Okay.

40
00:03:03,974 --> 00:03:05,684
Phoebe.

41
00:03:05,893 --> 00:03:07,102
Clay.

42
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,814
It's really good to see you.

43
00:03:23,327 --> 00:03:25,037
You okay?

44
00:05:17,356 --> 00:05:19,942
What else don't I know?

45
00:05:20,484 --> 00:05:23,946
Prue, don't take this personally,
but sometimes you can be judgmental.

46
00:05:24,113 --> 00:05:25,990
Oh, that is so not true.

47
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:32,204
All right, so maybe
it's sometimes true.

48
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,333
I just don't understand why Phoebe
never even told me about this guy.

49
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:39,003
People don't like to dwell
on things that end badly.

50
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:41,922
Yeah, well, I wish my relationships
ended that badly.

51
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:44,550
Did you hear them last night?
There was music,

52
00:05:44,717 --> 00:05:47,553
- there was wine, there was...
- Talking.

53
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,972
And how do you know
there was wine?

54
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:51,432
Okay, so I peeked.

55
00:05:52,224 --> 00:05:57,020
Well, you know, if nobody tells me
anything, I have to get creative.

56
00:05:57,521 --> 00:06:00,232
Stop worrying. She'll be fine.

57
00:06:01,942 --> 00:06:03,444
She knows what she's doing.

58
00:06:03,652 --> 00:06:06,613
Watch that entrance,
make sure nobody comes in.

59
00:06:23,213 --> 00:06:26,925
- Whoa, Doug. Easy.
- Thanks, Piper.

60
00:06:27,926 --> 00:06:29,302
I hope Shelly didn't see that.

61
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:32,222
Don't worry about it, Doug.
You just hang in there.

62
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:37,310
- What was that?
- What?

63
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,480
That. You know, the guy, the glass.

64
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:42,107
Do you do that often?

65
00:06:42,274 --> 00:06:44,901
Freeze time in front of,
I don't know, let's say, everybody?

66
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,363
Yeah. I'm finally getting
some control over the unfreezing.

67
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,491
The poor guy, he just keeps
dropping everything.

68
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,869
- Then maybe you should just fire him.
- The owner wants me to.

69
00:06:55,036 --> 00:06:57,581
Actually, he threatened
to fire me if I don't.

70
00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:00,792
But he's going through a hard time.
Shelly, the waitress, just dumped him

71
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,379
- after six years of dating.
- So, what? You're playing cupid

72
00:07:04,546 --> 00:07:08,925
- at the risk of your own job?
- Yeah. I mean, Doug loves her.

73
00:07:09,134 --> 00:07:11,261
He even bought an
engagement ring and everything.

74
00:07:11,428 --> 00:07:14,264
He just waited too long to ask.
So now he's a wreck.

75
00:07:14,472 --> 00:07:18,977
Still, you can't just keep, you know,
freezing in order to protect him.

76
00:07:19,185 --> 00:07:20,895
I know.

77
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:23,940
So are you still going back
to Buckland's?

78
00:07:24,107 --> 00:07:25,984
Yeah, that's where I work.

79
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:29,404
I just figured after everything
that happened with Rex and Hannah

80
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:31,364
that you would be hitting
the classifieds.

81
00:07:31,573 --> 00:07:34,784
Well, if we don't save
the auction house, I might have to.

82
00:07:34,951 --> 00:07:36,619
Rex...

83
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:40,832
Bankrupt.

84
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,667
What were you saying?

85
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:45,336
Never mind. Gotta go.

86
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:59,725
I wish you could've been there,
Phoebe. You would've loved Egypt.

87
00:07:59,934 --> 00:08:06,691
Pyramids, giant sphinx,
Nile river, camel taxis.

88
00:08:06,857 --> 00:08:09,527
- It was amazing.
- You rode a camel?

89
00:08:09,694 --> 00:08:12,154
They're friendlier than some
of the cab drivers I've met.

90
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:14,782
Can't imagine they're faster.

91
00:08:18,285 --> 00:08:20,162
You were right to leave me.

92
00:08:20,538 --> 00:08:22,790
Oh, and the conversation turns.

93
00:08:22,957 --> 00:08:26,127
No, I'm serious. You're the best thing
that ever happened to me

94
00:08:26,293 --> 00:08:28,379
and I blew it. I know that.

95
00:08:28,546 --> 00:08:30,214
Clay...

96
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:33,968
- What? Too much too soon?
- Yup.

97
00:08:36,178 --> 00:08:40,432
Look, I hope you don't
take this the wrong way.

98
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,021
But why are you here
with me now?

99
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,358
What? Can't a guy visit?

100
00:08:49,525 --> 00:08:51,652
Yeah, but you're not just a guy.

101
00:08:51,819 --> 00:08:55,906
You're Clay, and Clay
comes with strings attached.

102
00:08:56,073 --> 00:08:58,951
I never could
hide anything from you.

103
00:08:59,118 --> 00:09:02,538
Actually, you could. That was one
of our problems, remember?

104
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,916
I picked up this urn at...

105
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,544
...an overseas market.

106
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,295
Thought it might be
worth something.

107
00:09:11,213 --> 00:09:14,967
So you want me
to get Prue to help you

108
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:17,094
because of the auction house.

109
00:09:17,261 --> 00:09:19,012
Guilty.

110
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:21,890
For a minute there,

111
00:09:22,057 --> 00:09:25,185
I thought you were here
to win me back.

112
00:09:25,352 --> 00:09:26,687
No, Phoebe.

113
00:09:26,853 --> 00:09:30,732
I think too much for you
to still believe you're interested.

114
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:32,567
Look,

115
00:09:33,193 --> 00:09:34,778
it's no secret.

116
00:09:34,945 --> 00:09:37,114
I've been in some trouble.

117
00:09:37,322 --> 00:09:38,990
I've gotten in too deep.

118
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:42,744
I thought if I could sell this urn,
make some money, pay off a debt,

119
00:09:42,953 --> 00:09:44,830
I can make a fresh start.

120
00:09:46,665 --> 00:09:48,834
Hey, think about it.

121
00:09:50,502 --> 00:09:52,462
Please, Phoebe.

122
00:09:59,594 --> 00:10:02,764
- Hi.
- Oh, hi. You must be Prue.

123
00:10:03,306 --> 00:10:06,101
- And you must be...
- Claire.

124
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:07,560
Claire Pryce.

125
00:10:07,727 --> 00:10:11,439
The bank assigned me to see
if the business is worth salvaging.

126
00:10:11,606 --> 00:10:13,775
I'm looking for inventory records.

127
00:10:13,942 --> 00:10:16,486
The files in my predecessor's
office were empty.

128
00:10:17,112 --> 00:10:20,657
Yes, well, Rex and Hannah
weren't exactly qualified.

129
00:10:21,366 --> 00:10:25,203
Obviously why Buckland's
is in such dire straits.

130
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,999
To be honest with you, Prue,
I don't know anything

131
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,377
about auction houses,
and I know even less about art.

132
00:10:32,585 --> 00:10:34,504
But what I do know
is the bottom line.

133
00:10:35,004 --> 00:10:39,968
If we don't move $1.2 million worth
of inventory at the auction tomorrow,

134
00:10:40,176 --> 00:10:41,636
I'm shutting the place down.

135
00:10:41,803 --> 00:10:44,806
- Excuse me, did you say "tomorrow"?
- Did I stutter?

136
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:50,019
With all due respect, you don't just
decide to throw an auction, okay?

137
00:10:50,186 --> 00:10:53,898
You need advance notice,
a catalogue, buyers.

138
00:10:54,065 --> 00:10:57,360
Then it looks like you've got a lot
of work ahead of you, doesn't it?

139
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,617
Sorry.

140
00:11:05,576 --> 00:11:07,328
Who was that?

141
00:11:07,495 --> 00:11:09,163
The new sheriff.

142
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,415
- Hey, Prue.
- Hey, Clay. What's up?

143
00:11:11,582 --> 00:11:13,376
A favour.

144
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:17,338
Clay was hoping that maybe
you could sell this for him.

145
00:11:17,505 --> 00:11:20,466
Yeah, I picked it up
at a market overseas.

146
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:23,010
Picked it up?
Does that mean you bought it?

147
00:11:23,177 --> 00:11:24,428
What else could it mean?

148
00:11:25,137 --> 00:11:27,598
Well, it's really beautiful.

149
00:11:27,765 --> 00:11:31,602
Gold inlay, 24 carat, a lot of lapis,
looks to be from Egypt.

150
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:34,146
Exactly.
That's where I was travelling.

151
00:11:34,313 --> 00:11:38,526
- These etchings are very unusual.
- You think it's worth something?

152
00:11:38,734 --> 00:11:43,072
Well, I would have to determine
the urn's origins, its previous owners...

153
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,992
- Couldn't you just skip a step or two?
- Phoebe, I cannot risk

154
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:50,079
this auction house's reputation on
something like this without checking.

155
00:11:50,246 --> 00:11:53,207
Come on, come on. I will...

156
00:11:53,374 --> 00:11:55,459
What will I do?
I will cook you dinner.

157
00:11:55,626 --> 00:11:57,920
Don't threaten me.
Fine, I'll see what I can do.

158
00:11:58,087 --> 00:11:59,630
Hey, thanks. Thanks a lot.

159
00:11:59,838 --> 00:12:01,423
Is she the best or what?

160
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,883
Thank you, thank you.

161
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,843
I love you.

162
00:12:15,687 --> 00:12:16,980
Thanks for doing that, Phoebe.

163
00:12:17,147 --> 00:12:20,108
No problem. Prue will get you
a great price for it too.

164
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:21,693
She's really good at her job.

165
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,821
Well, it'd be nice if she
just liked me a little bit.

166
00:12:24,988 --> 00:12:28,367
She likes you. She's just real
protective of me, that's all.

167
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:32,204
- I remember when that was my job.
- Yeah, and then I quit you.

168
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:33,622
Hey, Clay.

169
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,500
Palmer.

170
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:39,711
- What are you doing here?
- I'm bumping into you.

171
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:42,589
- Aren't you gonna introduce us?
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

172
00:12:42,756 --> 00:12:44,966
Phoebe, this is Palmer.
I met him in Cairo.

173
00:12:45,175 --> 00:12:47,677
- Hi. Oh, wow. Small world, huh?
- Yeah.

174
00:12:47,886 --> 00:12:51,640
- Hey, what's going on with that urn?
- You know about the urn too?

175
00:12:52,557 --> 00:12:56,019
Well, actually that's where we met,
at the marketplace where I bought it.

176
00:12:56,186 --> 00:12:59,314
Yeah, right, the marketplace.
I thought you were gonna sell it?

177
00:12:59,523 --> 00:13:01,483
Phoebe's sister works
at that auction house.

178
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,152
- She's looking for a buyer.
- That's good. That's good.

179
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:07,072
The sooner the better, I guess, huh?

180
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:11,034
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.

181
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:13,995
It's just I'm a little tired.
Jet lag, you know.

182
00:13:14,204 --> 00:13:16,456
Are you staying at the Ashcroft
like I suggested?

183
00:13:16,665 --> 00:13:17,791
Yeah, sure.

184
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:19,459
Good. Me too.

185
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:21,795
Maybe we'll hook up later?

186
00:13:22,962 --> 00:13:25,465
- It was nice to meet you.
- Oh, yeah. You too.

187
00:13:28,968 --> 00:13:30,929
Creepy guy.

188
00:13:32,305 --> 00:13:34,015
Yeah.

189
00:13:35,558 --> 00:13:37,560
You hungry?

190
00:13:53,117 --> 00:13:55,995
- Help you?
- I was a friend of Wesley's.

191
00:13:56,162 --> 00:13:58,664
His family wanted me to make sure
he got home all right.

192
00:13:58,831 --> 00:14:01,334
Sorry. How did he die?

193
00:14:01,501 --> 00:14:02,794
I don't know.

194
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,213
Spider bite, I think.

195
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,466
He's off to JFK, right?

196
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:10,718
First flight in the morning.

197
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:19,560
Sorry, Wes.

198
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:46,545
What am I supposed to think, Piper?

199
00:14:46,754 --> 00:14:49,465
Phoebe's ex pops into town and wants
me to sell something for him.

200
00:14:49,632 --> 00:14:51,008
You think that's a coincidence?

201
00:14:51,217 --> 00:14:53,594
Oh, Prue, you wonder why
you're out of the loop.

202
00:14:53,761 --> 00:14:55,554
You worry too much about Phoebe.

203
00:14:55,763 --> 00:14:59,433
No, I don't. I just don't wanna
see her get hurt, that's all.

204
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,978
Look, I just get this really
bad feeling about Clay.

205
00:15:03,145 --> 00:15:05,189
<i>- I can't explain it.
- I can.</i>

206
00:15:05,397 --> 00:15:07,066
You don't think
he's good enough for her.

207
00:15:07,232 --> 00:15:10,194
Just like you didn't think Jeremy
was good enough for me.

208
00:15:10,361 --> 00:15:13,197
Of course, in his case, you were right.
But that's not my point.

209
00:15:13,405 --> 00:15:17,785
No, your point is that it's none of my
business, and you're probably right.

210
00:15:18,243 --> 00:15:20,746
Speaking of playing matchmaker,
how's Doug?

211
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:22,706
The same, unfortunately.

212
00:15:22,873 --> 00:15:25,667
Except I'm getting a little
freeze frazzled. It's draining.

213
00:15:25,876 --> 00:15:28,086
Don't you think you need to find
a better way to deal,

214
00:15:28,253 --> 00:15:29,504
before you get fired?

215
00:15:29,713 --> 00:15:31,215
I know.

216
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,009
I gotta go. I gotta go.

217
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,309
Sorry, Doug. Too pooped to pop.

218
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,231
I'm surprised you moved back here.

219
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,109
I remember a few late nights,
a few beers,

220
00:15:51,276 --> 00:15:54,112
a few not-so-pleasant
conversations about your sisters.

221
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,200
And here you are
living together again.

222
00:15:58,408 --> 00:15:59,743
Necessity or choice?

223
00:15:59,951 --> 00:16:02,496
I think a little bit of both.

224
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,664
Anyway, things have...

225
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:07,209
...kind of picked up
at the Halliwell Manor.

226
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:10,086
- Yeah? Like how?
- Oh, well, let's just say

227
00:16:10,253 --> 00:16:14,299
San Francisco has been a lot more
unusual than New York.

228
00:16:14,466 --> 00:16:17,427
- More rice?
- No, thanks.

229
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:20,639
You know, Phoebe,

230
00:16:20,805 --> 00:16:24,059
you really haven't said much
about what you've been doing.

231
00:16:24,225 --> 00:16:27,353
- Protecting the innocent from evil.
- Come on, be serious.

232
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,940
I mean, you barely
had a spare minute in New York,

233
00:16:31,107 --> 00:16:33,318
three jobs just to afford
your social calendar.

234
00:16:34,277 --> 00:16:36,488
Things have changed.

235
00:16:37,238 --> 00:16:38,740
I've changed.

236
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:43,995
I'm trying to change too.

237
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:50,209
One thing that won't change
is how I feel about you.

238
00:16:57,925 --> 00:16:59,469
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have.

239
00:16:59,635 --> 00:17:04,724
No, it's not that, believe me. I...

240
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:10,521
It took me a long time
to get over you. And...

241
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:13,733
...I just wanna be careful.

242
00:17:17,111 --> 00:17:19,155
I understand.

243
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:22,366
But if I clean up my act...

244
00:17:24,327 --> 00:17:25,912
...would you consider moving back.

245
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,788
Do not go there now.

246
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:35,629
- Sorry to interrupt.
- It's okay. It happens.

247
00:17:36,464 --> 00:17:38,799
I should get back
to the hotel anyway.

248
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:41,927
- Clay, stop. I got it. I got it.
- Okay.

249
00:17:42,219 --> 00:17:45,473
- So how's it going with the urn?
- It's going.

250
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:48,976
I think what he's trying to ask is,
"Is it going, going, gone?"

251
00:17:49,185 --> 00:17:51,312
Well, I put it on the auction block.

252
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,731
Great. That's great. Thanks a lot.

253
00:17:53,898 --> 00:17:56,609
I'm still waiting for the background
check to come through on it

254
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,110
so I can set a reserve price.

255
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:00,446
Okay, whatever you get
for it is fine with me.

256
00:18:00,863 --> 00:18:02,907
As long as it sells, right,
and in a hurry?

257
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:07,161
Well, from what I understand,
if anyone can do that, it's you.

258
00:18:08,662 --> 00:18:11,665
So I will call you tomorrow.

259
00:18:11,832 --> 00:18:13,417
Maybe you can show me
around the city,

260
00:18:13,584 --> 00:18:15,961
help me see where I left my heart.

261
00:18:20,507 --> 00:18:23,051
Hey, I really appreciate it.
Thanks again.

262
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:25,304
Anything for Pheebs.

263
00:18:25,763 --> 00:18:28,682
- See you later.
- Okay.

264
00:18:32,603 --> 00:18:35,189
- What?
- Nothing.

265
00:18:35,689 --> 00:18:38,692
I can worry about
my little sister, can't I?

266
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:40,652
Don't ever stop.

267
00:18:48,243 --> 00:18:49,536
Are you okay?

268
00:18:49,703 --> 00:18:51,830
Nothing to see here. Move along.

269
00:18:52,372 --> 00:18:55,250
- Welcome to London.
- What did you do?

270
00:18:55,459 --> 00:18:57,002
More like, who did you do it to?

271
00:18:57,461 --> 00:19:00,881
I put a charm on Doug,
but I doubled the recipes.

272
00:19:01,047 --> 00:19:02,841
Just something to boost
his confidence

273
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:05,093
so he can give love a shot
and give me a break.

274
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,471
Go ahead, Prue. Yell at her.

275
00:19:07,637 --> 00:19:09,931
It's not for personal gain
and it fits into the whole

276
00:19:10,098 --> 00:19:11,558
harm-none thing
we have top live by.

277
00:19:11,725 --> 00:19:13,476
Besides, Prue told me
to do something.

278
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,729
- Did not.
- Yes, you did.

279
00:19:15,896 --> 00:19:19,316
I just need Doug to stop dropping
things so I can stop freezing things.

280
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:20,734
I'm just exhausted.

281
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,778
You know, maybe he and Shelly
aren't meant to be together.

282
00:19:23,987 --> 00:19:26,573
Not everybody's supposed to be.

283
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,284
Oh, that was real subtle, Prue.

284
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,913
Well, we'll never know unless Doug
has the guts to pop the question.

285
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,665
All I'm doing is giving it to him.

286
00:19:36,332 --> 00:19:39,377
<i>It's just like The Cowardly Lion
from The Wizard of Oz.</i>

287
00:19:41,254 --> 00:19:42,464
Well, it is.

288
00:19:48,803 --> 00:19:51,556
Ladies and gentlemen,
this exquisite bronze-plated carving

289
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,808
dates back well over 120 years.

290
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:56,394
Surely, it's worth more
than $2500 dollars.

291
00:19:56,561 --> 00:19:58,605
Do I hear 26? 26?

292
00:19:58,771 --> 00:20:02,608
Mark, move the F. Scott Fitzgerald pen
to the next slot, all right?

293
00:20:02,775 --> 00:20:04,861
Our buyer, Mr Gordenson,
is getting restless. Go.

294
00:20:05,028 --> 00:20:06,529
Twenty-six, going once.

295
00:20:06,696 --> 00:20:09,407
- I think you should see this, Prue.
- What is it?

296
00:20:09,574 --> 00:20:12,034
It's the appraisal on the urn
you requested.

297
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:15,830
The good news is
it's worth a fortune.

298
00:20:15,997 --> 00:20:18,291
- The bad news is...
- It's stolen.

299
00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:21,711
Apparently. No wonder
the auction house is going under.

300
00:20:21,878 --> 00:20:23,671
Selling stolen goods.

301
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,674
No, this is highly unusual
and very embarrassing.

302
00:20:26,883 --> 00:20:28,384
Yes, it is.

303
00:20:28,551 --> 00:20:31,554
Yes. Now 16? 16,000?

304
00:20:31,762 --> 00:20:33,931
- Oh, no.
- Sixteen thousand?

305
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,602
Fifteen thousand going once,
going twice.

306
00:20:39,312 --> 00:20:41,230
Sold for 15,000.

307
00:20:41,397 --> 00:20:43,357
Paddle number three.

308
00:20:43,524 --> 00:20:47,445
Next item up,
lot number 51, 5-1.

309
00:20:48,696 --> 00:20:53,742
This beautiful 24-carat
gold inlay urn from Egypt...

310
00:20:54,869 --> 00:20:57,204
Obviously,
there's been some mistake.

311
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:08,007
- Who are you?
- You must be Prue, Phoebe's sister.

312
00:21:08,215 --> 00:21:12,386
- Same question, who are you?
- Me?

313
00:21:12,553 --> 00:21:14,638
I'm a friend of Clay's.

314
00:21:14,847 --> 00:21:17,182
Why didn't you sell that urn?
You're supposed to sell it.

315
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:19,810
- I think you'd better leave.
- No. Don't you understand?

316
00:21:19,977 --> 00:21:22,521
- You have to sell it before the curse.
- Curse? What curse?

317
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,606
The urn, it's cursed.

318
00:21:24,815 --> 00:21:28,402
Never mind. Forget it.
I'll get rid of it myself.

319
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:32,823
Oh, my God. It is cursed.

320
00:21:33,031 --> 00:21:34,324
Oh, no.

321
00:21:36,702 --> 00:21:39,454
- What's going on?
- The curse.

322
00:21:39,621 --> 00:21:41,373
It's happening.

323
00:21:41,582 --> 00:21:42,916
It's too late.

324
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,419
I gotta get out of here.

325
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,140
So do you believe in giving people
second chances?

326
00:21:58,306 --> 00:22:01,852
Absolutely. That's probably why
I wanted to help out Doug so much.

327
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:06,440
Okay, well, Clay says he can change
and I wanna believe him, but...

328
00:22:06,606 --> 00:22:09,484
But you're afraid of getting hurt.
That's totally understandable.

329
00:22:09,693 --> 00:22:12,445
So I keep my distance
and then what?

330
00:22:12,612 --> 00:22:14,114
Hope that I'm wrong?

331
00:22:15,448 --> 00:22:20,370
Well, you could be. That premonition
of yours was definitely the future.

332
00:22:20,537 --> 00:22:23,873
Yeah, but the problem is
I keep thinking about the past.

333
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:28,795
When I moved to New York,
I was so angry.

334
00:22:29,337 --> 00:22:31,464
All right, I was scared.

335
00:22:32,215 --> 00:22:35,593
And then I met Clay,
and he helped me out a lot.

336
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,432
He was really good to me at a time
in my life when nobody else was.

337
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,518
Sorry, you know what I mean.
I didn't mean it like that.

338
00:22:43,685 --> 00:22:45,895
All right. That's fine.

339
00:22:46,688 --> 00:22:48,523
So why did you leave him?

340
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:51,192
Well, he kept living
beyond his means.

341
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:53,069
He never thought of the future.

342
00:22:54,112 --> 00:22:57,073
Yeah, I know that sounds familiar.

343
00:22:57,574 --> 00:22:59,867
Let's just say...

344
00:23:00,034 --> 00:23:02,328
...he took one too many shortcuts.

345
00:23:02,495 --> 00:23:07,125
Got involved with some bad people,
got in over his head, way over his head.

346
00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:11,671
And finally I just couldn't take it
anymore. I had to leave.

347
00:23:11,838 --> 00:23:15,550
And so now he's back, hoping to be
the man you fell in love with originally.

348
00:23:15,717 --> 00:23:18,594
Yeah. So, what do I do?

349
00:23:18,761 --> 00:23:20,179
What if he's the one?

350
00:23:20,346 --> 00:23:22,473
Like you say Doug and Shelly are.

351
00:23:22,682 --> 00:23:25,434
- Do I just walk away?
- No, but...

352
00:23:25,643 --> 00:23:27,061
We can't live together forever.

353
00:23:27,228 --> 00:23:32,608
What do we expect, to be 60 years old
and still be sharing clothes and a cat?

354
00:23:32,775 --> 00:23:35,444
Well, now that
you put it that way, no.

355
00:23:35,611 --> 00:23:37,822
I don't wanna live with you anymore.

356
00:23:42,994 --> 00:23:44,620
Oh, boy.

357
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:52,086
I thought your charm
was to boost his confidence

358
00:23:52,253 --> 00:23:54,630
not turn him into Tom Cruise.

359
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:56,924
Maybe I shouldn't have
doubled the recipe.

360
00:23:57,758 --> 00:23:59,218
Yeah.

361
00:24:01,345 --> 00:24:02,888
Doug.

362
00:24:03,681 --> 00:24:05,057
What's going on?

363
00:24:06,058 --> 00:24:10,020
Not sure, but whatever it is,
I feel great.

364
00:24:15,025 --> 00:24:16,944
Thanks, Doug.

365
00:24:17,528 --> 00:24:19,488
Doug, what about Shelly?

366
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:23,867
Who cares about Shelly when I got
Thursday, Friday and Saturday

367
00:24:24,076 --> 00:24:26,161
all lined up and waiting?

368
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:31,125
- I don't believe I've had the pleasure.
- I don't believe you will. Off limits.

369
00:24:34,336 --> 00:24:36,004
Well, your charm worked.

370
00:24:36,171 --> 00:24:38,549
- You've turned Doug into...
- A monster.

371
00:24:40,342 --> 00:24:43,428
I gotta go. I told Clay
I'd meet him over at the house.

372
00:24:43,637 --> 00:24:45,222
Goodbye.

373
00:25:03,115 --> 00:25:05,075
Leaving?

374
00:25:05,784 --> 00:25:08,495
- How'd you get here?
- I came with your friend.

375
00:25:08,662 --> 00:25:11,706
I waited for your fear
to consume you.

376
00:25:12,582 --> 00:25:14,626
Where's the urn?

377
00:25:15,252 --> 00:25:17,379
The Buckland Auction House.
I tried to get it back.

378
00:25:17,587 --> 00:25:18,839
I was gonna return it, I swear.

379
00:25:19,047 --> 00:25:23,385
I tired to make things right.
Please! Don't! I'm sorry.

380
00:25:24,511 --> 00:25:25,804
No!

381
00:25:26,012 --> 00:25:28,390
No, no, no!

382
00:25:29,057 --> 00:25:31,268
You're being punished
for your greed.

383
00:25:38,525 --> 00:25:41,444
So the band goes on at 10:00,
but if we get there before 9:00

384
00:25:41,611 --> 00:25:45,532
- there's no cover. You interested?
- In anything that involves you.

385
00:25:51,704 --> 00:25:53,498
Okay.

386
00:26:01,589 --> 00:26:03,508
- Déjà...
- Vu.

387
00:26:04,425 --> 00:26:08,012
I miss this.
The day-to-day of us.

388
00:26:11,641 --> 00:26:13,893
Yeah. Me too.

389
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,564
Okay, well, I'm gonna change now.

390
00:26:19,107 --> 00:26:20,233
Okay.

391
00:26:21,943 --> 00:26:23,820
Oh, you want me to leave.

392
00:26:23,986 --> 00:26:26,572
That's kind of
a loaded question, but yeah,

393
00:26:26,781 --> 00:26:30,201
- I think that would be best.
- Phoebe, we did live together.

394
00:26:30,368 --> 00:26:32,954
- It's not like I haven't...
- Yeah, I know.

395
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,790
But things have changed.

396
00:26:36,958 --> 00:26:39,627
Come here. Sit down.

397
00:26:42,338 --> 00:26:44,257
- Very different.
- Do they have to be?

398
00:26:44,715 --> 00:26:46,092
Well...

399
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,887
You know, when you...

400
00:26:50,972 --> 00:26:53,474
Okay, stop. Stop.

401
00:26:56,352 --> 00:26:59,021
Okay, go. Go.

402
00:27:01,065 --> 00:27:03,359
What am I doing?
What am I doing?

403
00:27:03,526 --> 00:27:08,531
Okay, you know this isn't fair
because I love it when you...

404
00:27:15,412 --> 00:27:16,956
Prue, you scared me.

405
00:27:17,122 --> 00:27:19,583
- Where's Phoebe?
- Upstairs.

406
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,752
But you might wanna...

407
00:27:22,461 --> 00:27:24,046
...knock.

408
00:27:26,048 --> 00:27:27,508
Phoebe, we need to talk.

409
00:27:29,885 --> 00:27:32,179
Yes, we do.

410
00:27:42,689 --> 00:27:46,193
- You know you don't have to leave.
- Yeah, I think I should.

411
00:27:48,028 --> 00:27:50,030
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

412
00:27:54,451 --> 00:27:55,869
I hope you liked the show.

413
00:27:56,078 --> 00:27:58,705
Phoebe, I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

414
00:27:58,914 --> 00:28:01,833
What, that it was my room
that you barged into?

415
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,086
I had more privacy
when I lived in New York,

416
00:28:04,252 --> 00:28:07,673
a tiny island crawling
with 8 million people.

417
00:28:07,881 --> 00:28:10,092
And at least one thief.

418
00:28:10,258 --> 00:28:12,469
I'm sorry, excuse me?

419
00:28:13,512 --> 00:28:15,389
My new boss handed this to me,

420
00:28:15,597 --> 00:28:18,809
thankfully just before
the urn could be sold.

421
00:28:19,893 --> 00:28:23,730
Clay didn't buy it at some
outdoor bazaar, Phoebe.

422
00:28:23,897 --> 00:28:26,983
- He stole it.
- This can't be right.

423
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:31,112
- It looks right, Pheebs.
- Seasons change. People don't.

424
00:28:31,321 --> 00:28:32,864
I changed.

425
00:28:33,031 --> 00:28:34,699
Do you remember what
you thought of me

426
00:28:34,866 --> 00:28:36,952
before I walked back
through that door?

427
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,079
- That's different.
- How is that different?

428
00:28:39,287 --> 00:28:40,747
You're my sister.

429
00:28:44,751 --> 00:28:47,295
Well, there's gotta be some mistake.

430
00:28:47,504 --> 00:28:48,880
It gets worse.

431
00:28:50,715 --> 00:28:52,884
If the background information
is accurate,

432
00:28:53,051 --> 00:28:55,804
there's a curse attached to the urn.

433
00:28:57,138 --> 00:29:00,016
Anyone who steals it ends up dead,

434
00:29:00,183 --> 00:29:02,310
a victim of The Guardian
who protects it.

435
00:29:02,477 --> 00:29:03,978
And she feeds off their greed.

436
00:29:04,187 --> 00:29:06,773
Okay, well, even if that's true,

437
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,983
Clay could've never known about it.

438
00:29:09,192 --> 00:29:11,611
Otherwise, he wouldn't have
brought it here.

439
00:29:11,778 --> 00:29:13,112
Are you sure, Pheebs?

440
00:29:13,321 --> 00:29:15,657
You wouldn't be the first Halliwell
to misjudge a guy.

441
00:29:15,865 --> 00:29:19,535
No, it's not about judging.
It's about knowing. And I know Clay.

442
00:29:19,702 --> 00:29:21,454
And I know what Clay has done.

443
00:29:22,038 --> 00:29:24,749
Okay, he put my job in jeopardy.
He lied to me.

444
00:29:24,916 --> 00:29:26,834
Phoebe, he lied to you.

445
00:29:27,752 --> 00:29:28,961
You don't know that.

446
00:29:30,671 --> 00:29:34,133
Look, I'm not saying
that he's perfect.

447
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:40,431
Okay, and even if he is foolish
enough to risk his own life...

448
00:29:41,724 --> 00:29:43,267
...he would never risk mine.

449
00:29:58,449 --> 00:30:01,619
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say this is a scorpion sting.

450
00:30:01,827 --> 00:30:03,954
A scorpion sting in San Francisco?

451
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:06,707
I know, but that's what it looks like.

452
00:30:06,916 --> 00:30:09,293
Any chance he was killed
somewhere else and moved here?

453
00:30:09,502 --> 00:30:12,213
No. The lividity is consistent
with where he was found.

454
00:30:12,755 --> 00:30:14,215
Well, I buy this place has roaches.

455
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:17,510
I'm not so sure about scorpions.
Anything else?

456
00:30:17,718 --> 00:30:20,262
Found someone's
business card in his pocket.

457
00:30:21,055 --> 00:30:23,015
Buckland's Auction House?

458
00:30:23,182 --> 00:30:25,017
Let me guess, Prue Halliwell?

459
00:30:25,226 --> 00:30:28,187
- Yeah. How'd you know?
- I'm cursed.

460
00:30:29,271 --> 00:30:32,733
Let me know when you get
the report back on that sting.

461
00:30:37,654 --> 00:30:39,073
Excuse me.

462
00:30:48,123 --> 00:30:49,541
Palmer?

463
00:30:59,343 --> 00:31:07,768
Lot 49, 2600. Lot 50, 15,000.
Lot 51, excluded.

464
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:11,897
Shouldn't that be turned in
to the proper authorities?

465
00:31:12,105 --> 00:31:14,691
I'm contacting Customs
as soon as we're finished here.

466
00:31:14,858 --> 00:31:19,112
Look, again I just wanna assure you
that I didn't have anything to do with...

467
00:31:19,321 --> 00:31:21,198
Just handle it.

468
00:31:21,656 --> 00:31:26,453
- How did we do?
- $1.28 million. We did it.

469
00:31:26,661 --> 00:31:28,872
The auction house lives
to see another day.

470
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,292
- Congratulations. Good work.
- Thanks.

471
00:31:36,838 --> 00:31:38,465
Hey.

472
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:41,176
Andy, hi.

473
00:31:41,343 --> 00:31:42,761
Here to arrest me again?

474
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,264
Not this time.

475
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:50,310
A scorpion.
Why am I not surprised?

476
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:52,604
I'm afraid I don't...

477
00:31:52,812 --> 00:31:55,899
A young man died last night
of a scorpion sting.

478
00:31:56,107 --> 00:31:59,152
- Palmer Kellogg, you know him?
- I don't believe I do.

479
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,070
Well, he obviously knew you.

480
00:32:01,237 --> 00:32:02,947
I found your card on his body.

481
00:32:03,698 --> 00:32:06,659
We did just have an auction.
I met a lot of people.

482
00:32:08,661 --> 00:32:11,289
Well, I'll bring a photo by later,
see if it jogs anything.

483
00:32:11,497 --> 00:32:13,541
That's fine.

484
00:32:18,129 --> 00:32:20,214
Prue, just because
we're not dating anymore,

485
00:32:20,381 --> 00:32:22,133
I want you to know
I still care about you.

486
00:32:23,843 --> 00:32:26,971
So if you're ever in a jam
or you ever need anything,

487
00:32:27,138 --> 00:32:28,973
just know you can always call me.

488
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:33,102
I know that. Thanks.

489
00:32:46,115 --> 00:32:48,951
- Clay, are you in there?
- Phoebe?

490
00:32:53,414 --> 00:32:56,375
- You stole the urn, didn't you?
- Why don't you come inside.

491
00:32:56,584 --> 00:33:00,046
No, I am not going anywhere
until you answer the question.

492
00:33:00,254 --> 00:33:02,340
Okay, yes.

493
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:09,138
Were you planning on saying
goodbye before you skipped town?

494
00:33:09,305 --> 00:33:10,890
Palmer's dead, Phoebe.

495
00:33:11,098 --> 00:33:13,809
- What?
- He died from a scorpion sting.

496
00:33:14,018 --> 00:33:15,561
I call Wesley to tell him.

497
00:33:15,728 --> 00:33:17,813
That's when his parents tell me
he's dead too.

498
00:33:18,022 --> 00:33:20,774
Spider bites. I don't know how,
I don't know why,

499
00:33:20,941 --> 00:33:22,985
but I know one thing,
I'm not gonna stick around.

500
00:33:23,152 --> 00:33:25,905
- You are such a liar!
- Phoebe, I'm not lying.

501
00:33:26,113 --> 00:33:28,741
You knew it was cursed when
you stole it. You knew the legend.

502
00:33:28,949 --> 00:33:30,659
What are you talking about?
What legend?

503
00:33:30,868 --> 00:33:34,538
Are you telling me that you didn't know
whoever steals the urn dies?

504
00:33:34,747 --> 00:33:36,582
Palmer, Wesley...

505
00:33:36,749 --> 00:33:38,375
I swear I knew nothing about it.

506
00:33:39,043 --> 00:33:41,587
- Yeah, right.
- Phoebe, you have to believe me.

507
00:33:41,795 --> 00:33:43,380
No, I don't.

508
00:33:43,547 --> 00:33:45,591
You're a liar, Clay.

509
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:47,843
You will never change.

510
00:33:48,427 --> 00:33:51,054
You'll always look for
the easy way out.

511
00:34:05,485 --> 00:34:06,945
Sorry.

512
00:34:07,154 --> 00:34:09,698
- I'll go get the broom
- Good idea.

513
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:12,909
I see you reversed the spell.

514
00:34:13,076 --> 00:34:15,829
Yeah and I've been given
until tomorrow to fire him.

515
00:34:15,996 --> 00:34:20,042
Maybe Prue was right.
Maybe they just don't belong together.

516
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:22,377
Seems like the theme of the day.

517
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:24,963
Oh, Clay?

518
00:34:25,172 --> 00:34:26,923
He totally used me, Piper.

519
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:30,260
He just used me to get to Prue.

520
00:34:31,386 --> 00:34:33,263
I'm sorry.

521
00:34:34,222 --> 00:34:36,391
Thanks for not saying,
"I told you so."

522
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:40,937
Why didn't I see it coming?

523
00:34:41,104 --> 00:34:43,773
- What am I, a sucker for punishment?
- No.

524
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,318
You see the good in people
and that's never wrong.

525
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:49,321
Besides, the wrong guys
are usually the most interesting.

526
00:34:51,031 --> 00:34:52,324
Until you get your hopes up

527
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:55,118
and let your guard down, and
then they reveal their true selves.

528
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:57,912
- It's so true.
- I mean, look at Doug.

529
00:34:58,121 --> 00:35:02,792
Great guy, kind of boring
on the surface, easy to overlook.

530
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:05,587
But maybe in the long run
we're better off with his type.

531
00:35:06,004 --> 00:35:08,923
Maybe in the way long run.

532
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:12,677
- I think I'm still looking for adventure.
- Then you risk paying the price.

533
00:35:15,555 --> 00:35:17,599
I got it.

534
00:35:18,433 --> 00:35:21,269
- Maybe it's a price worth paying.
- Yeah.

535
00:35:21,436 --> 00:35:23,897
I just don't know anymore.

536
00:35:24,063 --> 00:35:26,274
Thanks for the ear.

537
00:35:37,243 --> 00:35:38,661
- Can I come in?
- No.

538
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,831
Look, I may have lied
about buying the urn,

539
00:35:41,998 --> 00:35:43,666
but I swear I didn't know
it was cursed.

540
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:46,210
Well, that still makes you
a thief now, doesn't it?

541
00:35:46,419 --> 00:35:48,296
That's why I'm here.
I wanna make things right.

542
00:35:48,463 --> 00:35:50,673
I wanna turn myself in to the police.

543
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:52,091
I mean it, Phoebe, honest.

544
00:35:52,258 --> 00:35:54,135
It's the only way I can
redeem myself with you.

545
00:35:54,635 --> 00:35:57,388
And how do I know this isn't
just another one of your scams?

546
00:35:57,597 --> 00:36:00,391
I guess you don't, but I don't wanna
take shortcuts anymore.

547
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,435
I wanna take the urn
with me to the police.

548
00:36:02,602 --> 00:36:05,396
But there's no way Prue
is just gonna give it to me...

549
00:36:05,605 --> 00:36:07,440
...not without you there.

550
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:10,109
I need your help.

551
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:14,822
It's the last favour
I'll ever ask, I promise.

552
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:18,909
I don't think so.

553
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:21,954
Please.

554
00:36:29,295 --> 00:36:30,754
The curse.

555
00:36:30,963 --> 00:36:32,339
What?

556
00:36:32,506 --> 00:36:34,049
Let's go.

557
00:36:41,056 --> 00:36:43,600
- Phoebe, what is he doing here?
- Save it till later.

558
00:36:43,767 --> 00:36:45,769
I have seen the future,
and it's not bright.

559
00:36:45,936 --> 00:36:47,855
Oh, good. You didn't give
the urn to the police.

560
00:36:48,063 --> 00:36:49,773
No, I thought it might
get you in trouble.

561
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,484
You know that little legend
we were talking about?

562
00:36:52,651 --> 00:36:54,319
Well...

563
00:36:57,322 --> 00:37:00,784
- I think it's true.
- What the hell is that?

564
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,995
- Clay!
- Get him out of here.

565
00:37:03,162 --> 00:37:04,788
Go!

566
00:37:09,835 --> 00:37:12,045
I don't wanna harm you.

567
00:37:12,212 --> 00:37:14,631
- I came for the thief.
- Who are you?

568
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,384
I'm The Guardian of the urn.

569
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:19,636
You cannot destroy me.

570
00:37:25,017 --> 00:37:27,602
Phoebe. Run.

571
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:32,232
So now there are more who will die.

572
00:37:44,536 --> 00:37:45,787
I still don't understand.

573
00:37:45,954 --> 00:37:47,539
You stay down here,
we'll be right back.

574
00:37:47,706 --> 00:37:49,666
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you in the attic.

575
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:53,420
- Where are you going?
- Fill her in, I'll meet you guys upstairs.

576
00:37:54,963 --> 00:37:57,048
Piper is really into legends

577
00:37:57,215 --> 00:38:00,510
and Prue is really good
with her mind, so...

578
00:38:00,677 --> 00:38:03,471
Yeah, but that thing,
The Guardian, she's not even...

579
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,764
Human? Yeah. I know.

580
00:38:04,931 --> 00:38:06,558
But she's real
and we have to figure out

581
00:38:06,725 --> 00:38:09,769
- how to stop her before she gets you.
- I don't know what you're thinking.

582
00:38:09,936 --> 00:38:11,980
I do not want you
getting hurt because of me.

583
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,860
You know, I think
I actually believe you.

584
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:29,163
- Did you find anything?
- Nothing about Egyptian urns

585
00:38:29,372 --> 00:38:31,958
or greed demons. Zip.

586
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:34,252
Well, let's just hope that
she didn't follow us here

587
00:38:34,419 --> 00:38:36,379
because our powers
are useless against her.

588
00:38:36,546 --> 00:38:39,424
How is that possible? I mean,
that's never happened to us before.

589
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,509
Maybe we're not supposed
to protect him.

590
00:38:42,051 --> 00:38:45,388
- What are you saying?
- Look, all I'm saying

591
00:38:45,555 --> 00:38:47,515
is that maybe there's a reason.

592
00:38:47,682 --> 00:38:50,560
Like Piper trying to force Doug
and Shelly back together again.

593
00:38:50,726 --> 00:38:53,187
Maybe there are some things
that we're not supposed to save.

594
00:38:53,354 --> 00:38:55,815
No, we're saving Clay, period.

595
00:38:55,982 --> 00:38:58,693
There's just gotta be
something that we're missing.

596
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,069
Maybe this is something.

597
00:39:00,278 --> 00:39:03,864
It doesn't talk about the urn, but it
talks about the seven deadly sins.

598
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:06,742
- Greed being one of them.
- Wait a minute.

599
00:39:06,909 --> 00:39:09,036
The Guardian punishes the greedy.

600
00:39:09,203 --> 00:39:13,833
So maybe if Clay does something
selfless, it'll even the score.

601
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,669
Good luck.

602
00:39:19,088 --> 00:39:20,631
Sorry.

603
00:39:22,591 --> 00:39:24,260
Clay!

604
00:39:24,427 --> 00:39:26,262
Clay, where are you?

605
00:39:26,429 --> 00:39:27,847
Clay?

606
00:39:28,013 --> 00:39:31,475
- I think he left.
- I don't believe it.

607
00:39:31,642 --> 00:39:34,436
- Well, sorry, Pheebs.
- No, I mean, I really don't believe it.

608
00:39:34,603 --> 00:39:36,981
- He wouldn't just leave.
- You have a better explanation?

609
00:39:37,147 --> 00:39:39,233
He was worried about me,
he was worried about us.

610
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,569
I'm telling you...

611
00:39:41,735 --> 00:39:45,990
Wait, my vision, I think I know where
he's going. We gotta stop him.

612
00:39:56,458 --> 00:40:00,295
I knew you'd come back.
Your greed consumes you.

613
00:40:00,462 --> 00:40:02,256
I'm not here for the urn.

614
00:40:03,424 --> 00:40:06,927
- You must be punished.
- I know.

615
00:40:07,594 --> 00:40:10,180
When you're done with me,
that's it, right?

616
00:40:10,347 --> 00:40:13,892
- You're not gonna hurt anybody else?
- Not until somebody steals the urn.

617
00:40:14,101 --> 00:40:15,811
How do you know anybody will?

618
00:40:15,978 --> 00:40:17,813
Somebody always does.

619
00:40:34,663 --> 00:40:36,373
- Clay!
- Stay back, Phoebe.

620
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,959
- No!
- Phoebe, look out!

621
00:40:43,672 --> 00:40:46,675
<i>A selfless act.
Just like the Book of Shadows said.</i>

622
00:40:55,892 --> 00:40:59,145
- Where did it go?
- Who cares, as long as it's not here.

623
00:41:00,605 --> 00:41:02,190
Are you okay?

624
00:41:02,941 --> 00:41:04,859
Am I okay?

625
00:41:05,026 --> 00:41:08,113
Who says people never change?

626
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:23,419
Good thing we didn't have to use
our powers to vanquish her,

627
00:41:23,586 --> 00:41:25,380
otherwise Clay would've seen it.

628
00:41:25,547 --> 00:41:27,006
They didn't work anyway.

629
00:41:27,173 --> 00:41:30,343
Not something I hope
ever happens again.

630
00:41:31,219 --> 00:41:32,637
I forgot about Doug.

631
00:41:34,556 --> 00:41:37,350
- This is getting ridiculous.
- Tell me about it.

632
00:41:37,517 --> 00:41:41,020
That engagement ring's probably
still burning a hole in his apron.

633
00:41:42,689 --> 00:41:44,649
Where are you going?
What are you doing?

634
00:41:44,816 --> 00:41:48,111
Solving your problem
and keeping you employed.

635
00:41:51,697 --> 00:41:53,491
Okay.

636
00:41:57,912 --> 00:41:59,914
Sorry.

637
00:42:02,458 --> 00:42:04,293
What's that?

638
00:42:08,089 --> 00:42:10,591
I was carrying that around
for weeks trying to find

639
00:42:10,758 --> 00:42:12,635
the right time to ask you.

640
00:42:12,802 --> 00:42:16,055
- Ask me what?
- To...

641
00:42:17,682 --> 00:42:19,058
...marry me.

642
00:42:19,684 --> 00:42:23,396
But that's why I broke up with you.

643
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,898
I gave up on waiting.

644
00:42:34,031 --> 00:42:35,491
Maybe this would've
happened sooner

645
00:42:35,658 --> 00:42:38,285
if I kept my little Wicca-nose
out of their business.

646
00:42:38,452 --> 00:42:42,915
I guess you can't change people.
They have to change themselves.

647
00:42:43,582 --> 00:42:46,418
Speaking of that.

648
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,421
- Go, baby.
- Go, girl.

649
00:42:49,588 --> 00:42:52,341
- All right.
- You go. You can do it.

650
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,722
- Hey.
- Hey, I'm glad you stopped by.

651
00:42:59,473 --> 00:43:02,184
Any chance you're gonna
come back with me?

652
00:43:02,893 --> 00:43:05,312
No, this is my home now.

653
00:43:05,521 --> 00:43:07,731
You know me, I had to try.

654
00:43:09,108 --> 00:43:11,318
I know I've lied to you
about a lot of things,

655
00:43:11,527 --> 00:43:15,989
but one thing I never lied to you
about was how much I care about you.

656
00:43:17,157 --> 00:43:18,617
I know, Clay.

657
00:43:25,415 --> 00:43:28,418
- I guess I should be going.
- Yeah.

658
00:43:30,212 --> 00:43:33,548
You know, I hope
the next time we cross paths,

659
00:43:34,549 --> 00:43:36,843
I'll be the guy you always
think you see.

660
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,141
Goodbye.

661
00:43:51,775 --> 00:43:53,443
- Hey, you okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

662
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:58,198
He was just stopping by
on his way home. No big deal.

663
00:43:58,365 --> 00:44:00,742
I've heard that before.
