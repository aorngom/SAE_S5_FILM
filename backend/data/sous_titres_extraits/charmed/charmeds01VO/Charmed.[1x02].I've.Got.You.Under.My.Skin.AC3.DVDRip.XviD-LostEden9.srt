1
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:20,083
Sorry.

2
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:29,417
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Who?

3
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,875
Chef Moore,
he of the phoney accents.

4
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:34,375
Hires me and then quits
to open his own place?

5
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:37,083
Thank you very much.

6
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,083
I don't see
any customers complaining.

7
00:00:39,292 --> 00:00:42,458
Hello. I am not a restauranteur.
I am a chef.

8
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,875
I have no idea what I'm doing.

9
00:00:45,042 --> 00:00:47,000
Are you wearing my dress?

10
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:49,500
Hey, Brittany. I love that tattoo.

11
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:51,667
- Thanks.
- I thought it was illegal to get them

12
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,167
on your hand
because of the veins?

13
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:56,667
In the States, yeah.
I got it done in Tahiti.

14
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:58,875
Keep the change, Piper. I gotta jam.

15
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:01,875
- Okay, say hi to Max.
- Okay.

16
00:01:02,042 --> 00:01:04,083
Table nine, please.

17
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:14,417
Now back to my dress.

18
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:16,500
Okay, see that poster boy
to your left?

19
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:19,167
Just glance, don't be obvious.

20
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:20,833
I approve. Who is he?

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,333
His name is Alec,
and he's about to come over

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,500
and ask if he could buy me a martini.

23
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,000
How do you know?

24
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,833
Let's just say I solved
the age-old problem

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,375
of who approaches whom first.

26
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:35,042
- I had a little premonition.
- What?

27
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:37,750
Phoebe, you're not supposed
to use your powers, we agreed.

28
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:40,417
No, you and Prue agreed.
I abstained.

29
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:42,750
Besides, it's not like I can control it.

30
00:01:42,917 --> 00:01:44,292
It just... It popped into my head.

31
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,458
That's the whole point.
None of us can control our powers.

32
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:51,208
That's what scares me. I could panic
and freeze the entire restaurant.

33
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:53,042
Here he comes.

34
00:01:54,042 --> 00:01:56,167
- Hi.
- Oh, hello.

35
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:57,750
I was just sitting over there,

36
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:01,042
wondering if I could buy you
a martini or something?

37
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:03,208
Martini. Imagine that.

38
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:05,625
I would love one. It's Alec, right?

39
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,792
Yeah. How'd you know my name?

40
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:11,208
Wild guess.
Do you wanna grab a table?

41
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,458
Prue is gonna be pissed.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,875
News flash: Stop worrying.
You'll get wrinkles.

43
00:03:24,042 --> 00:03:25,667
Prue?

44
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,833
<i>Proving that they were
the devil's disciples</i>

45
00:04:59,042 --> 00:05:01,917
<i>was no easy task for the court
at the Salem witch trials.</i>

46
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,708
<i>But a remarkable event occurred.</i>

47
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:07,125
<i>One of the accused, Mary Easty,</i>

48
00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:10,250
<i>ran for the church
to profess her innocence.</i>

49
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,083
<i>Suddenly, there was
a clap of thunder,</i>

50
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,583
<i>and she was struck by
a bolt of lightning.</i>

51
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,917
<i>In the court's mind,</i>

52
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,042
<i>God himself had spoken,</i>

53
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,917
<i>forbidding the evil witch
from even entering his house.</i>

54
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,208
<i>The witches were subsequently
convicted of heresy</i>

55
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,833
<i>- and burned alive at the stake.
- Morning.</i>

56
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,583
- What are you watching?
- Nothing.

57
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:32,875
- Just a show.
- About witches?

58
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:35,667
Are you worried that we're gonna be
burned at the stake?

59
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:39,083
Yeah, right. By the way, Andy called.

60
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:41,292
- When?
- While you were in the shower.

61
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:44,417
- What did you tell him?
- That you were in the shower.

62
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,167
Bad date?

63
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,625
No.

64
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,375
No. No, not at all. It was great.

65
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,792
You know, dinner, movie.

66
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:57,542
- Sex.
- Excuse me?

67
00:05:58,042 --> 00:06:00,500
On your first date? You sleaze.

68
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,167
It wasn't exactly our first date, Piper.

69
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,542
High school doesn't count.
That was last decade. Spill it.

70
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,000
- Oh, that bad, huh?
- No.

71
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,917
Actually, that good. It was...

72
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,083
Well, we were amazing.
But that's not that point.

73
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,792
I told myself things
would be different.

74
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,458
That we would take it slow.
It just shouldn't have happened.

75
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:20,333
- What shouldn't?
- Prue slept with Andy.

76
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:22,667
- Hello.
- Thanks a lot, mouth.

77
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:25,417
Wait, you were gonna tell her
but not me? Family meeting.

78
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,000
Speaking of last night,
what time did you end up rolling in?

79
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,167
No, no, no.
Do not change the subject.

80
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:33,333
- Don't dodge the question.
- It must've been at least after 3.

81
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,000
I must still be on New York time.

82
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,750
Actually, that would make it later.

83
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,875
- Or maybe you and Alec...
- Who's Alec?

84
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,042
Some hottie she hit on
in the restaurant.

85
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,708
Excuse me, revisionist history.

86
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:46,000
He hit on me.
Remember the whole vision thing?

87
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,792
Vision thing?

88
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:50,458
Please tell me you didn't
use your powers.

89
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:52,833
Don't put me in the middle.

90
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:56,333
I'm not, you were born in the middle.
Look, I thought that we agreed.

91
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,833
No. We didn't. You agreed.

92
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,042
You laid down the law.
There's a difference.

93
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,750
Look, Phoebe,
our powers are not toys.

94
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,250
We have to be careful.
They could get us killed.

95
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,917
She's right, we don't want any more
warlocks finding us.

96
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:13,000
Look, it was just a lousy premonition,
that's all. Nobody died.

97
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,500
Besides, you guys can't control
your powers any better than I can.

98
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:20,833
And, FYI, nothing happened
last night.

99
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:22,958
At least nothing I'm ashamed of.

100
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,708
There's another reason
we have to be careful.

101
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,833
Andy thinks someone's
abducting women in our area.

102
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:30,708
Abducting women,
what do you mean?

103
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:35,042
It means that warlocks aren't the only
evil that we have to watch out for.

104
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,708
And, FYI, I'm not ashamed
of anything.

105
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:52,458
She didn't come home
at all last night.

106
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,667
That's not like Brittany, believe me.

107
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,750
Tell me, Max, what time did she leave
to go to Quake?

108
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,875
Eight, 8:30.

109
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,583
She called around 10,
said she was headed home.

110
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,083
But I'm really worried.

111
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:08,250
Chances are, she'll show up.
They usually do.

112
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,542
In the meantime,
the best thing you can do right now

113
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,375
is to go home in case she calls,
all right?

114
00:08:13,542 --> 00:08:16,125
- Will you do that?
- Yeah, okay.

115
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:17,750
Thanks.

116
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,250
Fourth one this week.

117
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:25,458
Yeah, well, they can't just be
disappearing into thin air.

118
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,833
You did something to your hair.

119
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:30,000
At least we've narrowed down
his feeding pool

120
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:31,583
to the area around the restaurant.

121
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,458
Well, better tell your sweetie
to lock the door tonight.

122
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,583
Pastor Williams.

123
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,917
- Oh, you scared me.
- I'm sorry.

124
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,583
Aren't you a little early?

125
00:08:56,792 --> 00:08:58,792
Dropping off the unused food
from your restaurant?

126
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,042
I thought you weren't coming by
till this afternoon?

127
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:06,458
Yeah, I am. I mean, I'm coming
back later with everything.

128
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:09,333
Great. So, what are you
doing here now?

129
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,833
Nothing, really. Just thinking.

130
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,042
About?

131
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,917
- Mary Easty.
- Who?

132
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:22,042
It's just a stupid documentary I saw.

133
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,417
By the way,

134
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:30,750
is it true that evil beings can't go into
a church without being:

135
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,625
Evil beings.
You mean, like, what, vampires?

136
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,167
Vampires. No.

137
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:42,167
I was thinking more
along the lines of witches.

138
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,167
Witches, huh?

139
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,833
Let me put it to you this way.

140
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,250
I sure wouldn't wanna risk it.

141
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:52,333
I gotta go. I'll see you later?

142
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:53,875
Yeah. Right.

143
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:55,792
Absolutely.

144
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,042
Hold the doors.

145
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:57,042
Damn it. Can you push 12, please?

146
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,208
Here, let me help.

147
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,583
Eighteenth-century French art.

148
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,000
You work at the auction house?

149
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,333
No, just interviewing,
if I ever get there on time.

150
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,250
Don't wanna get my King Louises
mixed up.

151
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,667
Hello?

152
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,500
Andy, how did you get this number?

153
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,333
I'm a detective, remember?
Prue, I think we should talk.

154
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,292
Yeah, you know it's just that
I'm really late for this interview.

155
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,083
I didn't mean for what happened
last night to happen, Prue.

156
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:31,708
Of course, I'm, you know,
totally wrong for it anyway.

157
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,958
Stuffy old auction house.
Don't know why they even called.

158
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:36,083
<i>Come on, Prue.</i>

159
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,875
<i>Listen to me. We've known
each other for a long time.</i>

160
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,458
<i>We just couldn't help ourselves.</i>

161
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,750
- It's nothing to be ashamed of.
- I know, Andy.

162
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,000
<i>All we did was make love.</i>

163
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:47,583
I know, Andy.

164
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:49,542
Then talk to me,
help me out here, Prue.

165
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,958
Why'd you sneak out like that?

166
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,542
I did not sneak...

167
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:55,458
...out.

168
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:58,000
Right, you were asleep,
I didn't wanna wake you.

169
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:02,833
And I did write you a note,
I just didn't leave it.

170
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,042
Hello?

171
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:08,375
Hello?

172
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:26,750
Hey.

173
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,208
Hey, it missed my...

174
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,917
It skipped my floor.

175
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,333
- Can't believe...
- Hit it again.

176
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,125
That was strange.

177
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,625
- Lucky you, huh?
- Yeah, I'm charmed, all right.

178
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,375
- Here you go. Thanks.
- Thank you.

179
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:57,958
Excuse me...

180
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,792
...but aren't you Stefan?

181
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:01,833
Yes.

182
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,167
- I'm sorry, do we know each other?
- Highly doubtful.

183
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,167
I'm just familiar with your work.

184
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,875
Like everyone else in the world.

185
00:13:08,042 --> 00:13:09,417
Well, I don't know about that.

186
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:12,500
But I'll always take a compliment
from a gorgeous woman.

187
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,208
I'm sure your girlfriend
must appreciate that.

188
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,875
She's not my girlfriend.

189
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,750
Then why are you whispering?

190
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,292
Excuse me.

191
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,833
- Oh, okay.
- I'll be in the car.

192
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,583
Well, it was really nice meeting you.

193
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,292
You too. Listen, listen.

194
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:28,542
I'm in town for a couple of days
doing a Porsche shoot.

195
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,417
If you're interested, stop by.

196
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,458
I would love to photograph you.

197
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:37,000
You do model, don't you?

198
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,875
In my dreams, yeah.

199
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,833
A driver called in sick,
can you do a delivery?

200
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,708
Sure. Is that guy at the bar
staring at me?

201
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,667
A lot of guys at the bar
are staring at you.

202
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,917
The one at the far end.
Tall, dark, brooding.

203
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,375
Very New York.

204
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:59,542
Sorry, no.

205
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:06,083
He's seen your résumé
and is very impressed.

206
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,958
Although I have to tell you,
he's already blown out six applicants.

207
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,542
I still don't know why he's interested.
I never even applied.

208
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:13,167
He likes what you did
at the museum.

209
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,292
Even though your ex-boss
trashed you.

210
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,375
I mean, what's Roger
got against you anyway?

211
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:20,375
Hard to say, unless shattering
his male ego counts for something.

212
00:14:20,542 --> 00:14:22,667
He's also my ex-fiancé.

213
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,667
Got it. You ready?

214
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:26,625
Yeah.

215
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,250
Rex Buckland, this is Prue Halliwell,

216
00:14:30,542 --> 00:14:32,417
interviewing for the new specialist.

217
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,583
Actually, we've already met.

218
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,125
But welcome to my
stuffy old auction house.

219
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:07,042
Please, I beg you, don't hurt me.

220
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,958
Let me go! Please, Stefan.

221
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,500
It's Javna.

222
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:20,000
Oh, my God. Wait!

223
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,208
How many exhibitions
did you curate?

224
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,958
Seven, including the Carlton estate.

225
00:15:54,042 --> 00:15:55,708
It should be on my résumé.

226
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:58,375
Franklin Carlton.

227
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:00,708
That's quite a coup.

228
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,750
I tend to be on the persistent side.
I usually get what I want.

229
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,500
I don't doubt it.

230
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:08,625
It's a shame, though,
that you think you're...

231
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,375
How did you put it in the elevator?

232
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:13,500
"Totally wrong for the job."

233
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:15,583
That was a private
phone conversation.

234
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,708
Hardly.

235
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,917
You called me, remember?
Not the other way around.

236
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,208
While we're at it,
it's incredibly unfair of you

237
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,667
to eavesdrop on a private call
and then misjudge me,

238
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,167
based entirely on what
you thought you heard.

239
00:16:30,417 --> 00:16:33,208
I apologise. It was unfair of me.

240
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:37,083
I'm new at all this.

241
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,792
I've only just taken over the house
from my father,

242
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,583
so I'm very protective of it.

243
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,583
But, you know, I liked what you did
at the museum,

244
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,958
attracting a younger market.

245
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:52,417
I mean, it's totally consistent
with what I wanna do here.

246
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:55,833
It's just that, you know,
all these qualifications aside,

247
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,583
it's very important to me
that whoever I hire

248
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:00,750
truly wants to be here.

249
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,625
<i>- Yeah?
- Excuse me, Mr Buckland.</i>

250
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,417
<i>Your next interview is waiting.</i>

251
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,042
<i>Should I reschedule him?</i>

252
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:09,375
No, I think we're done here.

253
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:15,917
Well, thanks for your time.

254
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,167
My area of expertise ranges
from Ming dynasty

255
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,333
to a Mark McGwire
rookie baseball card.

256
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,083
You name it, I can identify it.

257
00:17:31,292 --> 00:17:35,333
Now, I may not have sought
this job originally, but I do want it.

258
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,792
And I am definitely right for it.

259
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:51,083
You would think after last night

260
00:17:51,292 --> 00:17:53,000
Prue would be a lot mellower.

261
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:57,500
I mean, how long had it been?
Six months? And she's worse.

262
00:17:57,667 --> 00:18:01,208
It's just so un-Prue-like
to have sex on the first date.

263
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,667
I mean, everything's changing
since we've become...

264
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,333
- Great, thank you.
- You know.

265
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:07,833
Come on, you never had sex
on the first date?

266
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:10,000
No. Have you?

267
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:13,375
- Don't answer that.
- Well, it's not a regular thing.

268
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:14,833
Of course, now that I'm a witch,

269
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:17,625
I can see if it's gonna be
any good or not before it actually...

270
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:19,292
Hi.

271
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:22,208
What's the matter with you,
are you out of your mind?

272
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,625
Come on, it's not like
he took me literally.

273
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:27,833
You don't know that. He could've.

274
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,708
I just think we need to be
extra careful.

275
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,542
In bed and out.

276
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:35,750
Okay, well, there's careful,
and then there's paranoid.

277
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:41,292
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- Talk about what?

278
00:18:42,542 --> 00:18:45,042
Hey, Phoebe, I didn't know
you were back in town.

279
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,375
Hey.

280
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,583
Take a bite out of the Big Apple,
did you?

281
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,750
I ate the worm.

282
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:52,792
I'm gonna get some gum.
You guys want anything?

283
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,250
- No, thanks.
- Good to see you.

284
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:55,917
You too.

285
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:05,875
Okay, here's the deal.

286
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:09,583
I've got this friend.
Has a little problem, could be bad.

287
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,833
Not quite sure what to tell her.

288
00:19:12,042 --> 00:19:13,542
- You wanna go inside?
- No.

289
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,833
I mean, I've gotta get going.

290
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:18,333
So, what's her problem?

291
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,833
Well, she kind of,

292
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,833
sort of thinks she might be a witch.

293
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:27,958
Witches again, huh?

294
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,042
It's not a good thing, is it?

295
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:33,000
Certainly not a question
I get every day.

296
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:35,583
How well do you remember
your Sunday school lessons?

297
00:19:35,792 --> 00:19:38,417
Exodus 22:18.

298
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,583
Thou shalt not
suffer a witch to live.

299
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,917
- Meaning?
- If you go by the old school,

300
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,458
it means put her to death.
She's evil.

301
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:58,542
- Here you go.
- $3.52.

302
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,042
Should we use
the grandchildren's birthdays?

303
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,042
It's a $10 million jackpot.

304
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,792
Who knows, I mean,
today may be our lucky day.

305
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:12,833
- It may be.
- If not,

306
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,500
we're gonna lose our house.

307
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:25,292
Four, 16, 19, 30, 32 and 40.

308
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,875
Those are the winning numbers.

309
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:30,250
Yeah, yeah. Right, lady.
You want this stuff, or don't you?

310
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:35,250
Four, 16, 19, 30, 32, and 40.

311
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:38,625
Trust me, mister,
today is your lucky day.

312
00:20:40,292 --> 00:20:44,833
You know, I think I'll buy
one of these lottery tickets too.

313
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,500
Ready? Let's go.

314
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:55,875
- What are you smiling about?
- Nothing.

315
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,750
What do you want me to say?

316
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:12,083
Something just does not feel
right to me about this. I can't help it.

317
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:16,500
- Here we go again.
- I mean, where are they, right?

318
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:19,000
What's this guy doing
with these poor women?

319
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:21,500
Thinking alien abduction, are you?

320
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,875
I'm serious, Morris.

321
00:21:24,542 --> 00:21:27,000
I know. That's what scares me.

322
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:30,208
Let me guess.
Favourite movie growing up.

323
00:21:30,542 --> 00:21:33,000
<i>Ghostbusters? Am I right?</i>

324
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:37,000
Look, we got a crazy, Trudeau.

325
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:40,292
Likes the pretty ladies.
That's it, the end.

326
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,833
If he comes back looking for more,
we're gonna grab him, tag him,

327
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,500
make the world a safer place.

328
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:48,708
That too hard to follow?

329
00:21:51,792 --> 00:21:53,208
<i>Evil Dead 2.</i>

330
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,000
Favourite movie growing up,
just for the record.

331
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:07,792
Bank across the street. I think we
should grab the ATM tapes and see...

332
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,042
Whoa. Where you going?

333
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:16,167
No, no. Forget it, Romeo.
You're not blowing our cover.

334
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:19,292
Come on, Morris, cut me some slack.
I have to talk to her.

335
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,292
Please? Five minutes,
that's all I need.

336
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:33,958
Cindy, come on, your salmon's up.

337
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:37,042
Hector, way behind,
we need clean plates.

338
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,375
You didn't give Andy
my cell phone number, did you?

339
00:22:39,542 --> 00:22:41,667
- No, why?
- Never mind.

340
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:44,208
Remind me, I wanted to do this
for a living, right?

341
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:47,208
Looks like you're the only one
who'll be doing anything for a living.

342
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:48,542
I think I blew my interview.

343
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:50,792
I can't imagine you were
less than stellar.

344
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,500
- What is Phoebe doing here?
- Flirting.

345
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:56,042
Yeah, and she's wearing Armani.
Where did she get that?

346
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,458
Not from my closet.

347
00:22:59,042 --> 00:23:00,833
Gotta go.

348
00:23:02,792 --> 00:23:04,750
Prue, hi. This is my other sister.

349
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,500
Prue, this is Stefan,
the photographer.

350
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,708
- Pleasure.
- Likewise.

351
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,250
Nice dress.

352
00:23:13,417 --> 00:23:14,875
Don't worry, it's not yours.

353
00:23:15,042 --> 00:23:16,792
I know, I could never afford it.

354
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:19,750
Will you excuse me for one minute?

355
00:23:19,917 --> 00:23:21,750
I'll be right back.

356
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,333
You charged it?
How are you gonna pay?

357
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:33,000
- You're broke.
- Not for long.

358
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,333
What does that mean?

359
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,458
- You didn't use your powers again.
- Maybe.

360
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,833
Are you telling me you haven't?

361
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,917
No, I'm not telling you that, but
we're not talking about me, are we?

362
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:45,167
- What are you guys doing in here?
- Same thing we do at home.

363
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:47,500
What, did you go to the track,
play the market, what?

364
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:49,375
- The lottery.
- Phoebe!

365
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:52,125
What did you want me to do,
ignore the premonition?

366
00:23:52,292 --> 00:23:53,583
Not help a needy family?

367
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,750
That's what we're supposed
to do, right?

368
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:59,292
No, we are not supposed to use
our powers for our own personal gain.

369
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:01,167
<i>That is what it says in
the Book of Shadows.</i>

370
00:24:01,417 --> 00:24:03,833
- Not so loud.
- You said we needed money, right?

371
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:05,833
- Well, I'm getting some.
- Come on, you guys.

372
00:24:06,042 --> 00:24:09,375
- So get a job like everybody else.
- I'm using my mind instead.

373
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:12,375
Prue.

374
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:14,875
Watch it!

375
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:17,708
Oh, no. No, no, no.

376
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,833
- Not again.
- Now look at what you've done.

377
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,833
This is my fault?

378
00:24:22,042 --> 00:24:25,000
- You guys aren't frozen?
- Guess it doesn't work on witches.

379
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:26,833
Piper, how long does it last?

380
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:30,542
I don't know. Not long.

381
00:24:30,792 --> 00:24:34,542
- It doesn't work out there either.
- Oh, tell me this isn't happening.

382
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:46,417
Calm down, it's okay.
It's all gonna be okay.

383
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:52,542
God. Andy's partner came in,
and he's headed this way.

384
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:55,125
- What are we gonna do?
- Stall him.

385
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,667
Hey, Inspector Morris, right?

386
00:24:58,917 --> 00:25:00,417
That's right. Is Trudeau in there?

387
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,542
- Andy? I don't know, is he?
- Hostess said he...

388
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,458
Okay, breathe, Piper, breathe.

389
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:06,250
- Excuse me.
- I have not...

390
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:08,125
Wait.

391
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,250
I really think we should...

392
00:25:11,417 --> 00:25:12,917
...talk.

393
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:14,917
What are you doing here?
I had five minutes.

394
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:16,917
Yeah, I gave you ten.

395
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:18,917
How...?

396
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,458
Guys, you know,
we're really busy in here.

397
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:26,333
- Yeah, sure.
- I'll call you later, I promise.

398
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,042
- Okay. Good.
- Okay.

399
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,042
Bye.

400
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,917
I hate being a witch.

401
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:14,292
Hey. What are you doing?

402
00:26:15,292 --> 00:26:17,333
Reading. Thinking.

403
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:20,417
About what?

404
00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:24,000
About how totally screwed we are
now that we're witches.

405
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,542
Oh, that.

406
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:30,417
You don't understand.
You don't think we are.

407
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:34,792
You're never afraid of anything.

408
00:26:34,958 --> 00:26:37,125
I envy that about you, always have.

409
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:40,958
Yeah, well, don't, because
it gets me into trouble sometimes.

410
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:44,208
Piper, talk to me.

411
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:46,792
I don't know.

412
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:50,667
It's just, our whole lives,
we've been like everybody else.

413
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:55,875
Rushing off to work, going out
on bad dates, buying shoes.

414
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Then, suddenly,
we wake up one day

415
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:02,042
and everything is different.

416
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:04,375
We're witches now.

417
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:07,417
I don't know if that's a good thing
or a bad thing.

418
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,625
Are you kidding? It's a great thing.

419
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:11,708
We don't know that.

420
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:14,667
We don't know anything
about these powers.

421
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:17,833
Why we have them,
what they mean,

422
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,625
where they even come from.

423
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,417
I mean, how do we know it's not...?

424
00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:26,875
How do we know it's not from evil?

425
00:27:27,917 --> 00:27:30,917
Piper, we've been through this.
We're good witches.

426
00:27:31,042 --> 00:27:33,750
How do we know?
What about Jeremy?

427
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:37,375
What about all the other warlocks
he said would be coming after us?

428
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:39,792
How do we know
we're not just like them?

429
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,792
That is what scares me.
We don't know.

430
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:48,458
I just...

431
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:52,625
I just wanna be normal again,

432
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,542
as messed up as that was.

433
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:58,750
Is that too much to ask for?

434
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,792
Piper, listen to me.

435
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:08,250
You are the sweetest,
most caring person I have ever met.

436
00:28:09,417 --> 00:28:11,042
No, I mean that, you are.

437
00:28:12,042 --> 00:28:15,083
You're always there to help anybody,
even strangers.

438
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:17,083
You've been doing it your whole life.

439
00:28:17,417 --> 00:28:20,708
So there's no way that
you've been given this...

440
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:24,792
This gift...

441
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:26,875
...if it wasn't to do good things with it.

442
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:29,750
To protect the innocent,

443
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,375
<i>just like the Book of Shadows says.</i>

444
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:36,333
Besides, if anyone should be
concerned with being bad,

445
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,792
it's me, right?

446
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:43,708
You've got nothing to be afraid of.

447
00:28:46,917 --> 00:28:49,000
I gotta run.

448
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:52,167
I am going to get my picture taken.

449
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:06,500
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

450
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,833
- Look...
- Andy.

451
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,833
- You go first.
- Go ahead.

452
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,500
I'm not sorry it happened, Prue.

453
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:22,583
Well, I have to be honest with you,
Andy, I am.

454
00:29:25,792 --> 00:29:27,917
I mean, not because I didn't enjoy it.

455
00:29:28,792 --> 00:29:31,083
I did. Especially the...

456
00:29:31,417 --> 00:29:32,708
Yeah, that was great.

457
00:29:32,917 --> 00:29:34,458
Yeah.

458
00:29:34,667 --> 00:29:38,208
And, of course, there was the...

459
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:40,375
That was nice too.

460
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:42,833
Yeah, but, you know,
that's not the point.

461
00:29:43,042 --> 00:29:44,500
It's...

462
00:29:45,542 --> 00:29:48,875
I haven't seen you
in almost seven years...

463
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,708
...and to start right back
where we left off is...

464
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:55,458
I know, I know, believe me.

465
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:58,208
I just wanna know why you left,
that's all.

466
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:02,083
Why can't you tell me?
What's the big secret?

467
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,875
- Believe me, you don't wanna know.
- Try me.

468
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:08,000
Well...

469
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:12,917
...my life, it's gotten
a little complicated.

470
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:18,375
And I just don't think that I should
get involved in anything right now.

471
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:20,583
Prue,

472
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,750
we had sex. It doesn't mean
we have to elope.

473
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:28,458
Okay.

474
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:31,542
How about this?

475
00:30:32,042 --> 00:30:34,708
Why don't we just pretend
like it never happened?

476
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,542
Do you want me to toss you
a life preserver now

477
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:40,792
or just let you sink on your own?

478
00:30:40,958 --> 00:30:43,125
No, no. I'm serious.

479
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:46,583
We'll just count that one
as part of our old relationship.

480
00:30:47,667 --> 00:30:49,667
We'll slow down, we'll start over.

481
00:30:50,708 --> 00:30:53,667
Prue, we've been given
a second chance here.

482
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:55,958
I don't wanna blow it this time.

483
00:30:59,042 --> 00:31:02,375
- Dating in the '90s.
- Excuse me.

484
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:05,542
Hello?

485
00:31:07,667 --> 00:31:11,250
Yeah, absolutely,
I'm sure that I can make that.

486
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:12,417
Okay, thanks.

487
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,292
That was the auction house.

488
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:17,625
They want me to come back in
for a second interview.

489
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,958
I've gotta go.

490
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:24,792
Just give me a little time
to think things through, okay?

491
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:37,917
I have nothing to be afraid of.

492
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:39,583
I have nothing to be afraid of.

493
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:43,417
Nothing. Nothing to be afraid of.

494
00:31:44,958 --> 00:31:46,292
Nothing.

495
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,750
I'm good!

496
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:10,083
- Brittany?
- You know me?

497
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:11,375
Is that my name?

498
00:33:16,958 --> 00:33:18,417
Prue, thank you for coming back.

499
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:21,583
Well, thanks for having me back,
although I must admit I didn't expect it.

500
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,250
I told you I was interested,
and I am.

501
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:26,958
But first of all, I'd just like to test
your expertise, if you don't mind.

502
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:29,917
Let's see how good your really are.
Careful, watch your step.

503
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:32,417
This is Hannah Webster,
one of our assistant specialists.

504
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:36,250
- This is Prue Halliwell.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

505
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:38,958
Please, tell us about this piece.

506
00:33:42,292 --> 00:33:44,750
<i>Well, Madonna of the Meadow.</i>

507
00:33:44,917 --> 00:33:47,167
Giovanni Bellini, 16th century.

508
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:48,833
Fabulous piece.

509
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:51,333
Worth $3, 4 million easily
if it wasn't a copy.

510
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,917
What makes you think it's a copy?

511
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:56,417
Too well-preserved. No yellowing.

512
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:58,833
Besides, the frame support is in pine,

513
00:33:58,958 --> 00:34:02,292
and Italian painters
used poplar back then.

514
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,292
What about this one?

515
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,625
Degas.

516
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:13,458
Actually, this was the only sculpture
he exhibited himself.

517
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:16,167
Watch out.

518
00:34:25,042 --> 00:34:27,083
You okay?

519
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,833
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

520
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:32,375
You sure? I'm sorry.
I can't believe that happened.

521
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:34,083
No, it's okay.

522
00:34:34,292 --> 00:34:39,000
Well, I really don't know what to say.

523
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:42,375
Except you're hired,
if you still want the job.

524
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,500
- Are you serious?
- Can you start Monday?

525
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:47,708
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Terrific. It's done, then.

526
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:50,333
Yeah, we can sort out the details
when you come in.

527
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:52,708
In the meantime, welcome aboard.

528
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:55,417
Thanks. Thanks a lot. Bye.

529
00:35:00,917 --> 00:35:02,542
Well, what do you think?

530
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:06,625
I think either she's
the luckiest woman alive,

531
00:35:06,792 --> 00:35:07,958
or she's a witch.

532
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:15,250
Piper? Phoebe?

533
00:35:15,417 --> 00:35:18,000
- Guess what.
- What?

534
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:20,167
Prue, thank God you're home.

535
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:23,042
Yeah, who...?

536
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:26,750
Here you go, Brittany. Why don't you
go sit down at the table, okay?

537
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:29,042
There you go.

538
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,458
Sorry, Brittany?

539
00:35:30,625 --> 00:35:32,958
You're not gonna believe this.
I'm not sure I do.

540
00:35:33,167 --> 00:35:35,250
I think... No, I know.

541
00:35:35,417 --> 00:35:37,792
This woman is Brittany Reynolds.

542
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:39,792
Yeah, right, Piper,
and I'm Rosie O'Donnell.

543
00:35:39,958 --> 00:35:42,750
No, I mean it.
Brittany has a tattoo, right?

544
00:35:42,917 --> 00:35:45,542
An angel on her
right hand, remember?

545
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,250
- That can't be.
- That's what I thought at first.

546
00:35:49,417 --> 00:35:51,417
But then I started asking her
some questions,

547
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:54,000
things only Brittany would know.

548
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:57,708
She may be senile,
but it was enough to convince me.

549
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:19,125
Stefan, it's me, Phoebe.

550
00:36:42,917 --> 00:36:44,458
Piper, what are you talking about?

551
00:36:44,667 --> 00:36:48,375
<i>I'm telling you, I saw something
about it in the Book of Shadows.</i>

552
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:50,792
Okay, look, see.

553
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,833
"Javna feeds one week
out of every year,

554
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,625
stealing the life force
from the young."

555
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:57,833
"By invoking a black-magic power
of the evil eye to gain eternal youth."

556
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,542
It's gotta be what happened
to Brittany.

557
00:36:59,708 --> 00:37:02,292
Yeah, but there must be some
incantation to reverse it somehow.

558
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,792
There is.

559
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:05,208
The Hand of Fatima.

560
00:37:05,417 --> 00:37:08,917
It says that the prophet Muhammad
invoked it centuries ago

561
00:37:09,167 --> 00:37:12,917
to banish Javna back
to wherever the hell he came from.

562
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:15,667
Yeah, well, the problem is,
we don't know who Javna really is,

563
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,042
let alone where he is.

564
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:32,833
Brittany?

565
00:37:35,042 --> 00:37:37,208
Oh, my God. What happened?

566
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:39,417
- Brittany, are you all right?
- I'll call 911.

567
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,917
And tell them what,
that she's dying of old age at 25?

568
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:43,125
What is it?

569
00:37:43,292 --> 00:37:46,125
It's a cocktail napkin
from my restaurant.

570
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:48,417
With Stefan's address on the back.

571
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,250
Javna.

572
00:37:51,417 --> 00:37:54,875
Prue, that's where Phoebe went.

573
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:57,375
Look at this, ATM tape
caught the first victim.

574
00:37:57,542 --> 00:38:00,000
And she's leaving with
that photographer, Stefan.

575
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:03,000
Yeah, jives with the last place
she was seen before she disappeared.

576
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:04,875
Is he on our suspect list?

577
00:38:05,042 --> 00:38:06,625
Just moved to the top.

578
00:38:06,792 --> 00:38:08,875
God bless ATMs.

579
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:18,417
Please, Stefan,
or whoever you are, let me go.

580
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:23,000
It's Javna.

581
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:38,375
- You see anything?
- No.

582
00:38:38,542 --> 00:38:40,250
- Prue.
- Look, we'll find her.

583
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:41,750
Maybe we should call the police.

584
00:38:41,917 --> 00:38:44,000
If Javna has her,
only we can stop him.

585
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:45,375
But we need Phoebe to do it.

586
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:48,000
The incantation only works
with the three of us.

587
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:02,292
Piper.

588
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:19,750
We need you. We don't have
a lot of time, okay?

589
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:23,083
Prue, grab the mirror!

590
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:29,625
Now.

591
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:32,625
<i>Evil eyes look unto thee
May they soon extinguished be</i>

592
00:39:32,792 --> 00:39:34,375
<i>Bend thy will to the power of three</i>

593
00:39:34,542 --> 00:39:36,292
<i>Eye of earth, evil and accursed</i>

594
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:37,792
You can't stop me.

595
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,625
I will live forever.

596
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:42,167
No!

597
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:45,667
<i>Evil eyes look unto thee
May they soon extinguished be</i>

598
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:47,458
<i>Bend thy will to the power of three</i>

599
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:49,667
<i>Eye of earth, evil and accursed</i>

600
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:37,583
Very cool.

601
00:40:43,792 --> 00:40:46,625
What the hell? Prue?

602
00:40:48,167 --> 00:40:49,500
What are you doing here?

603
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:52,833
Well, we were just trying
to get the van started.

604
00:40:53,042 --> 00:40:55,208
Yeah, Phoebe called,
she was having car trouble.

605
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:58,042
Stefan was gonna take
some pictures of me.

606
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,125
Do you have any idea how lucky
you are? This guy's the stalker.

607
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,542
No sign of him inside.

608
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:04,542
His car's here,
so he might still be around.

609
00:41:04,708 --> 00:41:06,458
Stay with them.

610
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,667
Excuse me.

611
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:16,750
Hey, how about that? You fixed it.

612
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,083
How about that?

613
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:20,500
Maybe we should go.

614
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,333
Good idea.

615
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,208
Thanks.

616
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:31,875
Call me?

617
00:41:32,583 --> 00:41:34,042
Sure.

618
00:41:47,458 --> 00:41:49,125
Excuse me.

619
00:41:49,667 --> 00:41:51,292
Excuse me.

620
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:54,792
Hey, how are you?

621
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:00,667
Do you know that girl?

622
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:03,792
I almost was that girl.
She was one of Stefan's victims.

623
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:05,500
Obviously doesn't remember.

624
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:08,500
- Lucky her.
- No, lucky me.

625
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:11,000
I learned my lesson.
I've got to be more careful.

626
00:42:12,208 --> 00:42:14,000
Excuse me, did I just hear right?

627
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:16,333
Did she actually admit
to doing something wrong?

628
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,333
- That's what I heard.
- Frame it, it won't happen again.

629
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,625
At least we helped those people.

630
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:24,125
I mean, it's nice to know
our powers really are good.

631
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:28,333
Yeah, good for everything
but our love lives, unfortunately.

632
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:31,958
Although I must admit,
they do come in handy once in a while.

633
00:42:33,042 --> 00:42:34,292
Hypocrite.

634
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:36,500
<i>And last night's
winning lotto numbers were</i>

635
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:38,542
<i>- four, 16...
- The winning numbers.</i>

636
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:40,250
I won.

637
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:42,833
Well, I did.

638
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:50,792
See, I told you.
You can't intentionally use the powers

639
00:42:50,958 --> 00:42:52,958
for your own personal gain,
remember?

640
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:55,917
It's a good thing I didn't take the tags
off that dress.

641
00:42:56,167 --> 00:42:59,167
Oh, well, at least the old couple
didn't lose their house.

642
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:01,500
A toast, to the power of three.

643
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:03,500
Whether we like it or not.
