1
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:10,427
I don't know. The Betsey Johnson
dress might be a bit too much for work.

2
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:13,388
That's what a new wardrobe's
all about, pushing the limits.

3
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:18,101
Yeah, and stretching the budget.
Maybe I should just check with Piper.

4
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:21,605
Oh, my God, Prue...

5
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,527
I'm so embarrassed.

6
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,738
Of course, she might have
other things on her mind,

7
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:32,199
like having her way
with the handyman.

8
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,493
- I thought you guys were shopping.
- Obviously.

9
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:37,412
Oh, look, front-clasp bra.
She means business.

10
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,414
- Serious business.
- Do you mind?

11
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:43,293
No, are you kidding? I think it's great,
as long as he's not still on the clock.

12
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,754
You guys have to get out of here
before he unfreezes.

13
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:48,131
I never know how long this thing lasts.

14
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,008
- How much did you guys spend?
- Lots.

15
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,385
Prue's new look is perfect
for an SHW.

16
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,554
- SHW?
- Single hot witch.

17
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:58,475
Prue, are you sure this isn't depression
buying? You know, post-breakup?

18
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,853
Does this look like something
a depressed woman would wear?

19
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,773
- Maybe you should borrow it.
- Okay, time's up.

20
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,359
You two gotta go. Go on.
Go in there and be quiet.

21
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,153
We will if you will.

22
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,345
Kit, what is it?

23
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,809
You forgot to unpack your briefcase
when you got home from work.

24
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,979
And you want to do it right now.

25
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,612
What you're about to pick up
is a tiara,

26
00:01:52,778 --> 00:01:55,740
but you really believe
it's your date book.

27
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,454
Now put it in the desk,
just like you always do.

28
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,209
Excellent.

29
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:11,047
Now you want to continue
getting ready for bed.

30
00:02:35,946 --> 00:02:37,531
Well?

31
00:02:37,698 --> 00:02:40,784
Prue did exactly as I told her to.

32
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:42,745
You know, I rather like
this new power.

33
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:46,999
- And are you sure she didn't see you?
- No, no, she couldn't see me.

34
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:52,129
- No, I was invisible.
- But then, how did you get there?

35
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,466
I've explained this to you, Hannah.

36
00:02:55,632 --> 00:03:00,137
It's called astral projection. With it,
I can transport myself psychically

37
00:03:00,345 --> 00:03:03,682
and implant a subliminal thought
into Prue's brain.

38
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:08,312
Just like I did when I tricked her into
leaving the vault today with the tiara.

39
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:13,025
See, I planted the thought that made
her think she came out empty-handed.

40
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:15,485
I still don't understand how it works.

41
00:03:15,777 --> 00:03:17,446
Watch.

42
00:03:26,413 --> 00:03:28,040
You want to disrobe for him.

43
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,835
Desperately.

44
00:03:41,303 --> 00:03:43,805
Understand now, Hannah?

45
00:05:38,586 --> 00:05:41,130
If you ran an employment agency,
wouldn't you want me?

46
00:05:41,297 --> 00:05:43,799
Maybe, but I'd definitely
want my suit back.

47
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:46,510
No, this is part of your old wardrobe.
I'm just recycling.

48
00:05:46,677 --> 00:05:51,056
- Well, the environment thanks you...
- But take it off. Yeah, I know, I know.

49
00:05:51,223 --> 00:05:52,891
Hi. Bye.

50
00:05:53,058 --> 00:05:55,853
Piper, didn't you have to go in
early this morning?

51
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:58,605
Right, that was the plan.
I'm running a little late.

52
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:02,359
It just took a little longer to get
out of bed this morning than I planned.

53
00:06:02,568 --> 00:06:04,111
Okay, bye.

54
00:06:04,278 --> 00:06:06,989
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

55
00:06:07,156 --> 00:06:08,740
You, Leo, last night. Dish.

56
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,119
Well, it was nice. It was...
Well, it was wonderful.

57
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,955
We just had a few problems.

58
00:06:15,163 --> 00:06:16,540
- Problems?
- What problems?

59
00:06:16,707 --> 00:06:19,710
Well, it's been a while
since, you know, I...

60
00:06:19,876 --> 00:06:23,922
And I was a little nervous,
and I kind of kept freezing him.

61
00:06:25,132 --> 00:06:29,428
- Piper, you didn't.
- I didn't mean to the first time.

62
00:06:30,053 --> 00:06:35,976
Okay, so at what point in the process
exactly did you freeze him?

63
00:06:37,436 --> 00:06:39,771
- Hello.
- I gotta go.

64
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,358
- No, no, Piper, we're only teasing you.
- Yeah, truth is we're just jealous.

65
00:06:43,525 --> 00:06:46,069
Yeah, we're just happy to see you
with a great guy finally.

66
00:06:46,361 --> 00:06:49,030
I mean, between you and Leo,
and Prue, the new, hot Wicca woman,

67
00:06:49,197 --> 00:06:52,158
and me, soon to be employed,
things are looking up.

68
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:54,244
Don't say that. The moment
somebody says that,

69
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:57,872
- everything always goes south.
- Unless you freeze him.

70
00:06:58,123 --> 00:07:00,500
I couldn't help it. It was so good.

71
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:04,379
Okay, okay, okay, come on.
If you're gonna borrow the car, let's go.

72
00:07:04,546 --> 00:07:07,799
- Good morning.
- Yeah, we heard.

73
00:07:09,426 --> 00:07:12,303
- Bye.
- Yeah, have a magical day.

74
00:07:15,432 --> 00:07:17,100
- What does she mean by that?
- Who knows.

75
00:07:17,725 --> 00:07:19,644
I'm late for work. Bye.

76
00:07:28,194 --> 00:07:30,154
- Bye.
- Bye.

77
00:07:43,668 --> 00:07:45,795
Jaime, hey, what's going on?
What happened?

78
00:07:45,962 --> 00:07:49,006
- We got robbed last night, Prue.
- You're kidding. What was stolen?

79
00:07:49,215 --> 00:07:51,884
- The Romanov tiara.
- Oh, my God, not the tiara.

80
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:55,179
- Prue.
- Rex, hi. Jaime just told me.

81
00:07:55,346 --> 00:07:58,141
- Yeah. Hello, nice to see you again.
- Hi, Rex.

82
00:07:58,307 --> 00:08:01,143
- I'm sorry about what happened.
- Yeah, me too.

83
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:05,356
I mean, a loss of this magnitude
could severely damage our reputation.

84
00:08:05,523 --> 00:08:07,191
Who is gonna consign anything
with us...?

85
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:10,861
No, no, no, we just have to get
the tiara back before word gets out.

86
00:08:11,445 --> 00:08:14,865
I agree. Will you take point on this
then? You know, help the police?

87
00:08:15,241 --> 00:08:17,368
You're really the only one
that I can trust.

88
00:08:18,035 --> 00:08:19,370
Sure, but what about you?

89
00:08:20,162 --> 00:08:22,790
Yeah, unfortunately, I've got
another commitment tonight

90
00:08:22,957 --> 00:08:24,083
that I can't get out of.

91
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,419
It's some good friends
who are giving a concert,

92
00:08:26,585 --> 00:08:28,796
and, well, I promised
I wouldn't miss it.

93
00:08:28,963 --> 00:08:30,714
- Oh, yeah? Who?
- The Verve.

94
00:08:31,465 --> 00:08:34,260
- Get out! Are you serious?
- You know them?

95
00:08:34,468 --> 00:08:36,512
Know them? I worship them.
"Bittersweet Symphony"

96
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:39,223
- is, like, the best song ever.
- Really?

97
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:42,393
I have an idea.
Why not join me tonight.

98
00:08:42,601 --> 00:08:44,603
Yeah, I'm sure I can rustle up
another ticket.

99
00:08:47,064 --> 00:08:49,566
Well, you wouldn't mind,
would you, Prue?

100
00:08:50,609 --> 00:08:53,779
- Of course not. Why would I mind?
- Then it's a date.

101
00:08:53,988 --> 00:08:56,240
Well, figuratively speaking, of course.

102
00:08:56,448 --> 00:08:58,534
- Of course.
- Yeah.

103
00:08:58,701 --> 00:09:02,413
- Pick you up at 7, all right?
- Yeah, that sounds great. Thanks.

104
00:09:02,621 --> 00:09:04,832
Oh, look at the time.
I gotta get going.

105
00:09:04,998 --> 00:09:08,293
Hey, I promise I'll have
the car back by noon.

106
00:09:08,502 --> 00:09:10,254
Thanks for pitching in, Prue.

107
00:09:14,132 --> 00:09:16,802
- Prue.
- Andy.

108
00:09:17,135 --> 00:09:19,054
- Are you on this case?
- Yep.

109
00:09:19,221 --> 00:09:20,889
I guess fate keeps
throwing us together.

110
00:09:22,724 --> 00:09:26,311
- You two know each other. I forgot.
- No, you didn't.

111
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,356
Well, I suggested that the inspector
speak with you

112
00:09:29,523 --> 00:09:32,943
since you were the last one
to actually see the tiara.

113
00:09:34,945 --> 00:09:37,739
If you need anything else,
please don't hesitate to call.

114
00:09:38,156 --> 00:09:40,617
We'd like to see the security tapes
as soon as possible.

115
00:09:40,784 --> 00:09:42,452
Oh, yeah, I'm sure Prue
can arrange that.

116
00:09:43,954 --> 00:09:45,288
Excuse me.

117
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,836
- How are you?
- Okay.

118
00:09:52,212 --> 00:09:55,882
It'd be better if you stopped by the
station so we could talk about all this.

119
00:09:56,049 --> 00:09:58,343
- One o'clock?
- Sure.

120
00:10:02,681 --> 00:10:05,308
I can't believe you're taking
that little witch to the concert.

121
00:10:05,642 --> 00:10:07,560
Rex, that was my ticket.

122
00:10:07,727 --> 00:10:10,146
Hannah, kitten.

123
00:10:11,314 --> 00:10:13,692
You know I'm only doing it
to upset Prue.

124
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:18,655
All the better to frame her and force
the sisters to relinquish their powers.

125
00:10:18,822 --> 00:10:21,116
How do you know they even can?

126
00:10:21,282 --> 00:10:25,203
<i>There is a special spell
in The Book of Shadows.</i>

127
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,039
When the time comes, they'll use it.

128
00:10:28,915 --> 00:10:30,792
Trust me.

129
00:10:34,462 --> 00:10:38,132
You put the tiara in the vault before
you left. Was anybody else there?

130
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:40,593
The security guard, Jaime.

131
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,553
Did he lock up the vault?

132
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,722
No, I did.

133
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:48,685
Okay, did you happen to take anything
out of the vault when you left?

134
00:10:48,851 --> 00:10:52,688
No. Is this an interview
or an interrogation?

135
00:10:53,147 --> 00:10:55,566
I'm sorry, I'm just trying
to get all the facts, that's all.

136
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:59,237
There were no signs of forced entry
into the auction house or the vault.

137
00:10:59,403 --> 00:11:02,698
So do you think that one of
the employees might have stolen it?

138
00:11:02,907 --> 00:11:04,909
- Strong possibility.
- Someone like me?

139
00:11:05,117 --> 00:11:07,161
No, don't be ridiculous.

140
00:11:07,328 --> 00:11:10,540
Still, we have to check out everyone's
story. Grand larceny's bigtime.

141
00:11:10,748 --> 00:11:12,667
Could cost a person
15, 20 years easily.

142
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:16,629
We've got enough for now. We have
any questions, we'll give you a call.

143
00:11:16,796 --> 00:11:19,006
Well, you know where to reach me.

144
00:11:20,216 --> 00:11:21,676
I think I still remember.

145
00:11:24,345 --> 00:11:26,222
- What was all that about?
- You tell me.

146
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:29,350
Last time you were ready to bust her.
Now you think she's Miss Innocent?

147
00:11:29,517 --> 00:11:32,603
That was a whole different situation,
completely unrelated.

148
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,730
Look, I'm not saying
she did it, all right?

149
00:11:34,897 --> 00:11:37,983
But you have to admit a lot of the
arrows are pointing in her direction.

150
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,903
It's also this. The security tapes
that Prue brought over?

151
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:44,615
One's missing.
The one from the vault.

152
00:11:56,835 --> 00:11:58,504
You're glowing.

153
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:01,256
Your face, total afterglow.

154
00:12:01,548 --> 00:12:04,218
It is not. It's just warm in here.

155
00:12:06,512 --> 00:12:08,389
So how much
was that tiara worth anyway?

156
00:12:08,555 --> 00:12:11,809
Well, I didn't get a chance to have it
appraised. We just got it in yesterday.

157
00:12:11,975 --> 00:12:15,229
But I would say well over
a million dollars.

158
00:12:15,395 --> 00:12:18,982
- Did they have any idea who stole it?
- Yeah, me.

159
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,110
So, what's on the dessert menu?

160
00:12:22,277 --> 00:12:25,489
- Hey, how was the concert?
- The best. It was amazing.

161
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,658
Still recycling, I see.

162
00:12:28,784 --> 00:12:32,162
Thanks for taking care of things
tonight, Prue. I really appreciate it.

163
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:34,331
Don't you just love that accent?

164
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,626
By the way,
how'd it go with the police?

165
00:12:38,669 --> 00:12:40,921
Oh, well, they think
it's an inside job, actually.

166
00:12:41,088 --> 00:12:43,507
Do they? How disturbing.

167
00:12:44,174 --> 00:12:47,260
Okay, shoptalk later.
We're gonna grab a table, okay?

168
00:12:47,427 --> 00:12:50,097
Take that one by the window.
I'll send Cindy over.

169
00:12:50,597 --> 00:12:54,017
- You're welcome to join us, Prue.
- No, thanks, I think I'll pass.

170
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,149
- She's a big girl, Prue.
- Meaning?

171
00:13:01,316 --> 00:13:04,861
He's rich, he's stable, he's handsome.
We should be happy for her.

172
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:08,198
- I'm thrilled.
- Are you jealous?

173
00:13:08,782 --> 00:13:11,743
No. No.

174
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,286
More like territorial.

175
00:13:13,745 --> 00:13:15,705
Okay, I would just like
to keep my work world

176
00:13:15,872 --> 00:13:17,707
separate from my home world.
Is that okay?

177
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,293
Good luck.

178
00:13:32,388 --> 00:13:34,349
Good morning.

179
00:13:34,516 --> 00:13:37,810
- Wow, roses. Who are they for?
- Guess.

180
00:13:38,603 --> 00:13:40,980
Leo, I need to call you back.
Something's about to come up.

181
00:13:41,147 --> 00:13:43,399
I'll see you later, okay? Bye.

182
00:13:43,566 --> 00:13:48,071
"Phoebe, thank you for a lovely
evening. The job is on its way. Rex."

183
00:13:48,446 --> 00:13:51,866
Oh, what a sweetheart.
Wait, who opened the box?

184
00:13:53,743 --> 00:13:57,080
I can't get over how beautiful
these are. Can you, Prue?

185
00:13:57,246 --> 00:14:00,583
So it must have been quite a night,
you know, after the concert.

186
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,835
I'll put these in some water.

187
00:14:03,002 --> 00:14:06,380
All I did was tell Rex that I was
going to the employment agency.

188
00:14:06,547 --> 00:14:09,091
He said he'd make a few calls
and help me out.

189
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,718
So, what's the big problem?

190
00:14:11,302 --> 00:14:14,931
Phoebe, really,
it's none of my business.

191
00:14:15,765 --> 00:14:17,725
It's just... Watch what you say
to him, okay?

192
00:14:17,892 --> 00:14:21,437
Because there are certain things I
don't want my boss to know about me.

193
00:14:26,776 --> 00:14:29,654
Andy, what are you doing here?

194
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,407
We're here to search your house
for the tiara, Prue.

195
00:14:33,574 --> 00:14:35,576
We've got a search warrant.

196
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:53,469
Wait, how can you guys even think
that Prue stole the tiara?

197
00:14:53,636 --> 00:14:55,054
We don't, Phoebe. Not necessarily.

198
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:57,181
Then what are you doing here,
spring cleaning?

199
00:14:57,348 --> 00:14:59,475
Any idea where the vault
security camera tape is?

200
00:14:59,683 --> 00:15:02,519
- I gave you the tapes.
- Not that one.

201
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:05,314
It wasn't there, Prue.

202
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,985
Why did you do that?

203
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:12,946
That's why.

204
00:15:13,697 --> 00:15:16,325
No, no, no, wait. That is not possible.
How did it get there?

205
00:15:16,825 --> 00:15:19,703
I don't know. You better come up
with an answer before they unfreeze.

206
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,581
- Someone must've planted it.
- Somebody's been in our house?

207
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:26,335
It doesn't matter. Just let them find it.
I have nothing to hide. I'm innocent.

208
00:15:26,543 --> 00:15:30,047
That doesn't look very innocent.
Piper, hide it.

209
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,682
You think you should check
under the pillows.

210
00:15:40,849 --> 00:15:42,684
Morris, check under the pillows.

211
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:51,359
How did he know to look there?

212
00:15:52,027 --> 00:15:54,529
Put it in the dresser.
He's already looked there.

213
00:15:59,951 --> 00:16:03,038
You want to look
in the dresser again.

214
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:10,128
- This is getting ridiculous.
- This is getting ridiculous.

215
00:16:10,295 --> 00:16:11,880
No, eerie is more like it.

216
00:16:12,923 --> 00:16:14,966
I will be right back.

217
00:16:16,384 --> 00:16:18,970
Don't worry, I'll just keep freezing
them until they give up.

218
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:22,307
You're a miserable witch.

219
00:16:23,308 --> 00:16:24,934
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

220
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:26,936
I feel like calling a shrink
for some reason.

221
00:16:27,145 --> 00:16:29,230
Okay, I put it in the...

222
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,108
Attic, attic.

223
00:16:35,153 --> 00:16:36,821
Nothing.

224
00:16:36,988 --> 00:16:39,199
I think that's good enough
for now, Morris.

225
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,242
I'm sorry about all this, Prue.
I really am.

226
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:44,329
- Yeah, I know.
- Come on, Trudeau. Let's go.

227
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:54,714
Witches.

228
00:16:56,299 --> 00:16:59,844
- Well, did the police find the tiara?
- No.

229
00:17:00,011 --> 00:17:02,680
Piper kept freezing them,
then moving it.

230
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:06,934
Well, how can we frame her if they
can't even find the evidence?

231
00:17:11,147 --> 00:17:13,357
We're gonna have to up the stakes.

232
00:17:16,611 --> 00:17:18,446
Somebody is obviously trying
to set me up,

233
00:17:18,613 --> 00:17:20,531
and they're using magic to do it.

234
00:17:20,698 --> 00:17:23,576
- But who? And how?
- Pick a warlock, any warlock.

235
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:26,329
Hey, what were the police
doing here?

236
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,289
Oh, nothing much really.

237
00:17:28,998 --> 00:17:31,208
Is it all right if I go up and fix
the bathroom sink?

238
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:33,628
Oh, knock yourself out, Leo.

239
00:17:36,213 --> 00:17:38,841
Did anyone ever think
that maybe he's a warlock?

240
00:17:40,468 --> 00:17:43,220
Why is it always someone I'm dating
that gets accused of being that?

241
00:17:44,388 --> 00:17:48,142
Don't answer that.
Answer that, it's safer.

242
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,646
Hello.

243
00:17:52,813 --> 00:17:55,983
Oh, yeah. Hi, Rex.
Look, I'm on my way in. It's...

244
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:02,072
Of course. Hold on.

245
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:04,033
It's for you.

246
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:11,623
Hello. Yes, I got the flowers,
and they're beautiful.

247
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,917
That was so sweet of you.

248
00:18:14,668 --> 00:18:17,212
They made quite an impression
over here too.

249
00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:19,757
A dinner party?

250
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:23,719
Yes, I would love to.
Hold on, let me grab a pen.

251
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:30,142
- So, what are you gonna do?
- What can I do?

252
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,686
My sister's dating my boss.
I don't really have a...

253
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,023
I meant about who's setting you up.
Do you have any idea who it could be?

254
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,150
It's gotta be somebody
at the auction house.

255
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,152
If I had to guess,
I'd start with the person

256
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,029
who said that they were
out to destroy me.

257
00:18:42,404 --> 00:18:43,780
Hannah?

258
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:46,283
Smart girl.

259
00:19:40,962 --> 00:19:45,133
Leo, what are you doing? I thought
you were going to fix the sink.

260
00:19:45,466 --> 00:19:48,136
Yeah, I was. I mean, I am. I just...

261
00:19:48,761 --> 00:19:50,471
I need to fix a light downstairs,

262
00:19:50,638 --> 00:19:52,974
and I was hoping there'd be some
old fixtures up here,

263
00:19:53,141 --> 00:19:54,976
you know, that I could cannibalise.

264
00:19:56,603 --> 00:20:00,606
Listen, there's something
I need to tell you.

265
00:20:00,815 --> 00:20:03,526
Something I don't think
you're gonna like.

266
00:20:03,943 --> 00:20:07,238
I might have to leave here soon.

267
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,367
I might have to go back home.

268
00:20:13,286 --> 00:20:16,330
- Is home far away?
- Yeah, it's pretty far.

269
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,834
I mean, I don't know for sure yet,

270
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:22,920
but, you know,
I wanted you to know just in case.

271
00:20:24,172 --> 00:20:25,673
Thanks.

272
00:20:26,507 --> 00:20:31,345
Well, I better get to work.

273
00:21:11,468 --> 00:21:15,389
You will see
a spectacular apartment.

274
00:21:17,474 --> 00:21:21,729
Phoebe, I am so glad
that you could make it. Please.

275
00:21:24,523 --> 00:21:26,900
- Wow, this is...
- Spectacular?

276
00:21:27,067 --> 00:21:29,528
That is exactly the word
I was gonna use.

277
00:21:29,695 --> 00:21:32,448
We must be on
the same wavelength.

278
00:21:32,614 --> 00:21:34,658
- Champagne?
- No, thank you.

279
00:21:34,825 --> 00:21:36,994
No, I insist.

280
00:21:40,372 --> 00:21:42,958
- Am I early?
- No, you're right on time.

281
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,752
But I thought you said
you were having a dinner party.

282
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,882
Yes, I am.
With a very exclusive guest list.

283
00:21:51,091 --> 00:21:52,926
Just you and me.

284
00:21:58,682 --> 00:22:00,267
A toast.

285
00:22:02,227 --> 00:22:04,271
- To your interview.
- Interview?

286
00:22:04,521 --> 00:22:06,398
<i>Yeah, at Zeitgeist magazine.</i>

287
00:22:07,357 --> 00:22:10,402
They want to meet with you,
you know, perhaps hire you

288
00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:12,487
for the fashion section.

289
00:22:12,654 --> 00:22:15,490
- Interested?
- Very.

290
00:22:15,991 --> 00:22:19,828
- But what's the catch?
- You have to sleep with me.

291
00:22:19,995 --> 00:22:21,830
Phoebe, what sort of man
do you think I am?

292
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,005
I hope you like sushi.
Imported fresh from Kyöto.

293
00:22:30,755 --> 00:22:34,134
Please, just make yourself
comfortable.

294
00:22:50,441 --> 00:22:53,820
You're having a premonition
of Prue at work.

295
00:22:54,487 --> 00:22:57,448
<i>She's in danger.
You fear a warlock's after her.</i>

296
00:22:57,615 --> 00:22:59,117
<i>You must save her.</i>

297
00:23:00,118 --> 00:23:01,869
Prue.

298
00:23:08,042 --> 00:23:11,671
I gotta go. I'm really sorry,
and I can't explain,

299
00:23:11,838 --> 00:23:16,175
but I'll call you, okay?

300
00:23:16,384 --> 00:23:19,095
Sorry. I'm really sorry.

301
00:23:27,937 --> 00:23:29,313
911?

302
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,274
I'm calling from
Buckland's Auction House.

303
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,319
I think someone's trying to kill me.
Please hurry.

304
00:23:44,537 --> 00:23:47,081
Working late?

305
00:23:47,248 --> 00:23:49,500
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

306
00:23:49,709 --> 00:23:52,628
It's okay.
I guess I'm just a little jumpy lately.

307
00:23:52,837 --> 00:23:55,089
Can't blame you,
with everything that's been going on.

308
00:23:55,464 --> 00:23:57,049
Yeah.

309
00:23:58,008 --> 00:24:00,302
Listen, Jaime, I was wondering,

310
00:24:00,469 --> 00:24:03,556
when the tiara was stolen,
was anyone else still here,

311
00:24:03,764 --> 00:24:06,725
like Hannah or Rex maybe?

312
00:24:06,892 --> 00:24:09,728
No, you were the last one out.
Just like tonight.

313
00:24:09,895 --> 00:24:12,606
Hardest-working woman
I've ever met.

314
00:24:12,773 --> 00:24:15,526
For what it's worth, Prue,
I know you didn't take it.

315
00:24:15,901 --> 00:24:18,862
I mean, of all people...
There's no way.

316
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:21,323
Thanks.

317
00:24:27,246 --> 00:24:28,872
Hannah's computer.

318
00:24:56,984 --> 00:25:01,196
Someone's after you. Behind you.

319
00:25:01,363 --> 00:25:05,701
You fear it's a warlock
with powers greater than yours.

320
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:15,001
You hear a scream. An innocent
to protect in the warehouse.

321
00:25:15,168 --> 00:25:18,964
- Jaime.
- Grab the artefact just inside the door.

322
00:25:44,864 --> 00:25:46,658
Jaime.

323
00:25:47,951 --> 00:25:49,494
Jaime.

324
00:25:49,661 --> 00:25:51,329
Prue!

325
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:56,793
- Phoebe.
- Thank God you're all right.

326
00:25:57,085 --> 00:25:58,753
He's dead.

327
00:26:14,894 --> 00:26:16,229
The tape found by the body?

328
00:26:16,396 --> 00:26:18,648
Security. Showing Prue
exiting the vault,

329
00:26:18,815 --> 00:26:20,817
putting the missing tiara
in her briefcase.

330
00:26:21,275 --> 00:26:24,237
- What? That can't be.
- Just saw it for myself.

331
00:26:24,862 --> 00:26:27,156
Somebody must've manipulated me
into taking it.

332
00:26:27,365 --> 00:26:28,991
The same way someone
manipulated me

333
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,244
into being a witness
against my own sister.

334
00:26:31,828 --> 00:26:34,413
- Any idea what they're talking about?
- Not a clue.

335
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,165
You were with Rex tonight,
weren't you?

336
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:39,627
Yeah, Prue, but I don't think this
is the time or place to get into that.

337
00:26:39,794 --> 00:26:43,047
No, I just meant that don't you
find it a little coincidental

338
00:26:43,214 --> 00:26:45,716
that right when you guys start
dating, all this is going on?

339
00:26:45,925 --> 00:26:49,553
No. And besides, I thought you thought
that Hannah was behind all of this.

340
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,889
- I do.
- Excuse us. Ladies.

341
00:26:52,056 --> 00:26:53,891
Do you mind if we ask
a few questions?

342
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,143
I already told you
what happened, okay?

343
00:26:56,310 --> 00:27:00,356
I was working late, I heard a noise,
I came down here and found Jaime.

344
00:27:00,564 --> 00:27:02,900
- You didn't know he had the tape?
- No, of course not.

345
00:27:03,067 --> 00:27:05,694
And why exactly did you pick up
the murder weapon again?

346
00:27:05,903 --> 00:27:08,572
- You think she killed him, is that it?
- Phoebe.

347
00:27:08,739 --> 00:27:11,700
No, I wanna know how far
he's gonna go with this.

348
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:15,120
None of this has anything to do with
the fact that she dumped you, does it?

349
00:27:15,287 --> 00:27:16,872
- Stop it.
- Look, we got Prue

350
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,085
standing over the body of the security
guard who last saw her with the tiara.

351
00:27:21,252 --> 00:27:24,296
With the missing security tape
showing her taking it.

352
00:27:24,505 --> 00:27:27,049
And holding the murder weapon,
which you were there to witness.

353
00:27:27,216 --> 00:27:29,593
- What are we supposed to think?
- That I'm guilty as hell.

354
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,553
You know she didn't do this.

355
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,517
Then who did? Did you see anybody
run past you on the way in here?

356
00:27:36,683 --> 00:27:38,018
No.

357
00:27:39,353 --> 00:27:42,439
- I'm sorry, Prue. Brian.
- Yeah?

358
00:27:44,358 --> 00:27:47,194
You're under arrest
for suspicion of murder.

359
00:27:52,699 --> 00:27:54,910
- We should hire a lawyer.
- With what money?

360
00:27:55,077 --> 00:27:57,412
I don't know, but we can't
let her sit in jail all night.

361
00:27:57,579 --> 00:28:00,249
That's why we're here,
to get Rex's help.

362
00:28:05,796 --> 00:28:07,589
What are you doing?

363
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:19,392
This is so weird.

364
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:21,895
Are you sure this is the right place?

365
00:28:25,106 --> 00:28:27,776
This is my lipstick. I'm positive.

366
00:28:28,109 --> 00:28:29,861
He couldn't have moved out so fast.

367
00:28:31,905 --> 00:28:35,033
It must've been an illusion.
All of it.

368
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,244
- Even my premonition.
- How is that possible?

369
00:28:38,453 --> 00:28:44,000
Mind control, astral projection,
throwing charms. Who knows?

370
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:47,962
Prue was right about Rex,
which means I'm dating a warlock.

371
00:28:48,922 --> 00:28:50,632
Been there, done that.

372
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,767
Hey.

373
00:29:16,658 --> 00:29:18,201
Hey.

374
00:29:18,952 --> 00:29:20,620
Hey.

375
00:29:21,037 --> 00:29:23,331
- You wanna talk?
- I'm just running background checks

376
00:29:23,498 --> 00:29:25,541
on all the other employees
at the auction house.

377
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:28,002
- That's not what I meant, Andy.
- Andy?

378
00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:30,755
Did you call me by my first name?
Wasn't even sure you knew it.

379
00:29:31,297 --> 00:29:33,299
I heard Prue say it.

380
00:29:36,677 --> 00:29:38,513
She didn't do it, Morris.

381
00:29:38,721 --> 00:29:41,766
- You keep saying that.
- It's too pat, it's too easy.

382
00:29:41,933 --> 00:29:44,644
The evidence just keeps
falling in our laps.

383
00:29:46,145 --> 00:29:47,813
Maybe her sister was right.

384
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,066
Maybe your personal feelings
are getting in the way.

385
00:29:50,233 --> 00:29:52,568
- We've had that conversation, okay?
- Okay.

386
00:29:52,777 --> 00:29:54,946
But you stopped seeing Prue
for a reason.

387
00:29:55,112 --> 00:29:56,947
You thought she was hiding
something from you.

388
00:29:57,239 --> 00:30:00,034
How do you know she wasn't
hiding something like this?

389
00:30:00,493 --> 00:30:02,995
A secret life of crime?

390
00:30:03,162 --> 00:30:05,915
- I don't think so.
- You got a better explanation?

391
00:30:13,923 --> 00:30:16,175
You wanna book her
into county jail?

392
00:30:16,342 --> 00:30:18,802
No, let's just keep her here
for as long as we can.

393
00:30:19,053 --> 00:30:21,138
At least until the arraignment.

394
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:27,895
- What are you doing?
- Getting rid of the evidence.

395
00:30:28,062 --> 00:30:30,731
They can't bust Prue for murder
if they don't have a motive.

396
00:30:30,898 --> 00:30:33,859
- Mouth, Leo's in the kitchen.
- Oh, he is? Really?

397
00:30:34,026 --> 00:30:36,528
Focus. And think.

398
00:30:36,695 --> 00:30:39,156
The last thing we have to worry about
is the legal system.

399
00:30:39,323 --> 00:30:40,824
We're up against a warlock now.

400
00:30:40,991 --> 00:30:43,035
Two, if Prue's right about Hannah.

401
00:30:43,202 --> 00:30:46,163
Exactly. Which means we have
to figure out what they want.

402
00:30:46,413 --> 00:30:47,915
It can't just be to frame Prue.

403
00:30:48,123 --> 00:30:50,459
Unless in doing so they think
they can get our powers,

404
00:30:50,626 --> 00:30:51,960
which is what warlocks want.

405
00:30:52,127 --> 00:30:53,879
Which means
they're trying to divide us

406
00:30:54,046 --> 00:30:56,548
so that we don't have
the power of three to stop them.

407
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:59,009
What are we gonna do?

408
00:31:00,969 --> 00:31:02,763
We have no choice.

409
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,937
- Let's go.
- Go? Go where?

410
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:14,149
- Phoebe.
- Piper, it's gonna be all right.

411
00:31:19,071 --> 00:31:20,530
This is crazy.

412
00:31:20,697 --> 00:31:23,075
We have to get Prue out
before Rex makes his move on us.

413
00:31:23,241 --> 00:31:26,077
- But we can't break her out.
- Yes, we can. We're witches.

414
00:31:26,244 --> 00:31:29,247
All you have to do is freeze the guards
and then unlock Prue's cell.

415
00:31:29,414 --> 00:31:31,249
Me? What about you?

416
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:34,336
Somebody's gotta stay out here
in case something goes wrong.

417
00:31:34,503 --> 00:31:36,630
- Ready? On three.
- No, Phoebe.

418
00:31:36,838 --> 00:31:38,673
Three.

419
00:31:43,219 --> 00:31:45,180
Totally cool power. I hate you.

420
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,478
What are you doing?

421
00:32:01,321 --> 00:32:03,364
- Are you out of your mind?
- Just so we're clear,

422
00:32:03,531 --> 00:32:05,325
- this was Phoebe's idea.
- What?

423
00:32:05,492 --> 00:32:07,785
We think Rex is a warlock,
and he's after our powers.

424
00:32:07,952 --> 00:32:10,205
Phoebe's waiting outside for you
to rub her nose in it.

425
00:32:11,623 --> 00:32:14,334
Well, come on, Prue,
before they unfreeze.

426
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,378
- Piper, this isn't right.
- Well, neither is the gas chamber.

427
00:32:17,587 --> 00:32:22,008
If we're lucky, we'll vanquish them and
get you back here by morning rounds.

428
00:32:23,718 --> 00:32:26,054
- That's pretty lame.
- You got a better idea?

429
00:32:26,262 --> 00:32:27,930
- No.
- Let's go.

430
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:36,731
Don't touch them. Don't touch them.
Don't!

431
00:32:36,898 --> 00:32:38,483
Come on!

432
00:32:38,941 --> 00:32:40,401
Come on.

433
00:32:41,694 --> 00:32:43,029
Quite photogenic.

434
00:32:43,237 --> 00:32:46,574
Now, I should think the police will find
this very interesting, to say the least.

435
00:32:46,741 --> 00:32:48,784
- Rex.
- Wait, how did you know that we...?

436
00:32:48,951 --> 00:32:51,370
What, that you'd be here?
Well, let's just say that

437
00:32:51,537 --> 00:32:54,790
I've been watching your every move.
Without your knowing it, of course.

438
00:32:54,957 --> 00:32:56,751
You bastard.

439
00:32:57,209 --> 00:32:59,170
Don't get too angry, Prue.

440
00:32:59,337 --> 00:33:02,089
You really wouldn't want to injure me
with your power.

441
00:33:02,256 --> 00:33:04,342
I'm the only chance you have.

442
00:33:04,675 --> 00:33:07,219
Whilst you were conducting
your little prison break,

443
00:33:07,428 --> 00:33:09,555
Hannah was retrieving
the tiara from your home.

444
00:33:10,056 --> 00:33:12,475
You should've gotten rid of it
whilst you had the chance.

445
00:33:12,641 --> 00:33:14,852
Personally, I actually thought
that was an excellent idea.

446
00:33:15,478 --> 00:33:17,396
- Astral projection.
- What do you want?

447
00:33:17,897 --> 00:33:21,108
Your powers, of course. That's why
I hired you in the first place.

448
00:33:21,275 --> 00:33:23,444
You know, to see if you really were
the Charmed Ones.

449
00:33:23,611 --> 00:33:28,157
Then I waited, to test your strength,
to see how best to make my move.

450
00:33:28,324 --> 00:33:30,784
- And here we are.
- But why all the drama?

451
00:33:30,951 --> 00:33:33,203
Why didn't you just kill us
and take our powers?

452
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,080
Don't give him any ideas.

453
00:33:35,289 --> 00:33:37,666
No, no, no. I have seen exactly
what you can do

454
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:41,920
when you've been confronted directly.
That is why I opted for blackmail.

455
00:33:43,047 --> 00:33:45,674
<i>See, there is a special spell
in The Book of Shadows</i>

456
00:33:45,841 --> 00:33:49,428
that strips you of your powers forever.

457
00:33:49,595 --> 00:33:54,016
And this device
will capture those powers.

458
00:33:54,224 --> 00:33:56,852
- And you'll bring them to me.
- Go to hell.

459
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,897
Yeah, I'd love to, darling.
I miss it terribly.

460
00:34:00,063 --> 00:34:02,149
But this will help me return
with honours.

461
00:34:02,649 --> 00:34:07,112
In return, I'll give you the photo and tell
the police I simply misplaced the tiara.

462
00:34:07,446 --> 00:34:09,990
No theft, no motive for murder,
no prison.

463
00:34:10,157 --> 00:34:13,285
You really don't have much time.
Just until the prison guards

464
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:14,911
realize you've escaped.

465
00:34:16,663 --> 00:34:18,206
Well?

466
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:34,181
It's a relinquishment spell. If we read it
aloud, it takes away all of our powers.

467
00:34:34,347 --> 00:34:37,017
- Is there any way to reverse it?
- I don't know, it doesn't say.

468
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:39,060
Well, then I say
we flip to another page

469
00:34:39,227 --> 00:34:41,813
and find a spell
that kicks Rex's warlock ass.

470
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,398
- We can't.
- Why can't we?

471
00:34:43,607 --> 00:34:46,276
Because for all we know,
he's here right now watching us.

472
00:34:46,902 --> 00:34:50,238
And if we don't do exactly as he says,
he'll tell the police I've escaped.

473
00:34:50,405 --> 00:34:52,240
We can't give up our powers
without a fight.

474
00:34:52,407 --> 00:34:54,743
It's like giving up who we are,
who we've become.

475
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:57,329
- Who we've come from.
- Exactly.

476
00:34:57,495 --> 00:35:00,790
These powers are gifts.
Gifts that were given to us to protect

477
00:35:00,957 --> 00:35:03,793
and, ultimately, to pass on
to the next generation.

478
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,338
Don't you think that I know that?
I mean, how do you think I feel?

479
00:35:07,547 --> 00:35:09,549
I'm the one who got us
into this situation.

480
00:35:09,757 --> 00:35:11,342
- Prue, it's not your fault.
- It's not.

481
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:13,511
Yeah, but I'm the one
that Rex tricked.

482
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,972
I'm the reason why
we're having this conversation.

483
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:18,391
There has gotta be a way
out of this.

484
00:35:18,808 --> 00:35:20,226
Like what, become fugitives?

485
00:35:20,435 --> 00:35:23,646
Something tells me that's not
the best way to protect the innocent.

486
00:35:23,813 --> 00:35:26,399
Yeah, well, we can't protect
the innocent without our powers.

487
00:35:26,608 --> 00:35:29,944
And even worse, if we give them up,
we'd be giving them up to evil.

488
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:31,738
No, we can't let that happen.

489
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:34,824
Well, we can't let you die
in jail either.

490
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:39,495
Besides, with you behind bars,
we'll be divided. Rex wins either way.

491
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:43,374
- I don't wanna have to do this.
- Neither do I,

492
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:44,834
but we don't have a choice.

493
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:46,752
All we can do
is take the leap of faith

494
00:35:46,919 --> 00:35:48,629
and hope that somehow
it all works out.

495
00:35:56,512 --> 00:35:58,389
<i>"From whence they came
Return them now</i>

496
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:01,517
<i>Vanish the words
Vanish our powers"</i>

497
00:36:01,684 --> 00:36:03,686
<i>"From whence they came
Return them now</i>

498
00:36:03,853 --> 00:36:06,147
<i>Vanish the words
Vanish our powers"</i>

499
00:36:08,316 --> 00:36:10,234
Come on, Phoebe.

500
00:36:11,902 --> 00:36:16,657
<i>Okay. "From whence they came
Return them now</i>

501
00:36:16,824 --> 00:36:20,369
<i>Vanish the words
Vanish our powers"</i>

502
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:45,311
Look.

503
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:53,027
- Well, it was fun while it lasted.
- Yep.

504
00:36:54,528 --> 00:36:56,572
Let's get this over with.

505
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:02,202
They're coming.

506
00:37:03,537 --> 00:37:05,497
Good.

507
00:37:18,093 --> 00:37:19,886
Love you too, darling.

508
00:37:42,701 --> 00:37:44,244
Why, Hannah, you've changed.

509
00:37:46,705 --> 00:37:49,374
Dead 08/20/98.

510
00:37:57,549 --> 00:37:59,801
He died 8/20/98.

511
00:38:06,975 --> 00:38:09,185
Mr Morris. Trudeau.

512
00:38:09,352 --> 00:38:12,647
Get your butt over here,
I think I figured out who framed Prue.

513
00:38:14,858 --> 00:38:17,652
Okay, I say as soon as we get
the photo and the tiara back,

514
00:38:17,819 --> 00:38:20,572
we knock the lantern out of Rex's
hands and stomp on it.

515
00:38:20,738 --> 00:38:23,408
- What will that do?
- I don't know, free our powers?

516
00:38:23,575 --> 00:38:26,870
- It's better than doing nothing.
- How do we know this isn't a trap?

517
00:38:27,036 --> 00:38:31,207
You don't, actually. Nevertheless,
here you are. Powerless, I presume.

518
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:34,877
- Where's Hannah?
- Lurking. It's what she does best.

519
00:38:35,086 --> 00:38:37,839
The lantern, if you please.

520
00:38:41,592 --> 00:38:46,013
It all feels a little anticlimactic,
don't you think? Too easy almost.

521
00:38:47,265 --> 00:38:51,602
Feels as if we need
a more satisfying ending.

522
00:39:30,015 --> 00:39:31,058
No.

523
00:39:36,063 --> 00:39:38,232
Hannah, now. Quickly!

524
00:39:43,571 --> 00:39:46,865
- Wait, we have our powers back?
- How?

525
00:39:47,074 --> 00:39:49,159
Doesn't matter.
Get out of here fast.

526
00:40:10,848 --> 00:40:12,432
Rex.

527
00:40:13,141 --> 00:40:14,685
No.

528
00:40:16,895 --> 00:40:18,438
What have you done?

529
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,819
But it wasn't my fault.

530
00:40:23,986 --> 00:40:26,113
I didn't fail, he did!

531
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:29,616
No! Please, no!

532
00:40:41,336 --> 00:40:43,296
What the hell was that?

533
00:40:43,463 --> 00:40:46,424
I think you just answered
your own question.

534
00:40:46,591 --> 00:40:50,220
Okay, well, you gotta get me
back to jail now. Let's go.

535
00:40:54,683 --> 00:40:57,018
We're here to see Prue Halliwell.

536
00:40:58,937 --> 00:41:01,314
- Thanks, Eric.
- Thanks a lot.

537
00:41:11,074 --> 00:41:12,617
Prue?

538
00:41:22,502 --> 00:41:24,379
Andy, what is it? What's going on?

539
00:41:24,587 --> 00:41:26,464
Thought you'd like to know
you're off the hook.

540
00:41:26,673 --> 00:41:29,843
Turns out you were right.
Rex and Hannah were setting you up.

541
00:41:30,009 --> 00:41:33,429
- Or whoever they were.
- I don't understand.

542
00:41:33,596 --> 00:41:35,139
Well, we think they killed
two people,

543
00:41:35,306 --> 00:41:37,684
assumed their identities,
then took over the auction house.

544
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:41,854
Then they bilked it dry and tried
to cap it off with stealing the tiara.

545
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:44,357
Which we found hidden in his office.

546
00:41:44,816 --> 00:41:46,484
Wow, did you catch them?

547
00:41:47,485 --> 00:41:49,278
Not yet.

548
00:41:49,445 --> 00:41:51,489
I don't suppose you have any idea

549
00:41:51,823 --> 00:41:54,409
what this was doing
in his office, do you?

550
00:41:55,827 --> 00:41:57,787
- Quite photogenic.
- Isn't it?

551
00:42:03,251 --> 00:42:05,920
Spells, incantations, demon stuff.
It's all here.

552
00:42:06,087 --> 00:42:07,713
Everything. Just like before.

553
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,674
- Thank God.
- But how?

554
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:13,052
- I mean, we didn't reverse the spell.
- Well, maybe we screwed it up.

555
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:16,514
What? It's not like it would be
the first time.

556
00:42:16,681 --> 00:42:20,017
No, we didn't screw it up. Something
or someone must have done it.

557
00:42:20,184 --> 00:42:24,021
- It couldn't have happened on its own.
- Why not? It's magic.

558
00:42:25,106 --> 00:42:27,608
- Knock, knock.
- Leo.

559
00:42:27,775 --> 00:42:31,904
I... The front door was open.
I hope it's all right. I left my tool box.

560
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:37,368
That's funny, I don't remember
that being there last night.

561
00:42:37,535 --> 00:42:40,621
Yeah, well, you know what Freud
always said about leaving things.

562
00:42:40,788 --> 00:42:43,249
That you secretly
wanted to come back for it.

563
00:42:43,457 --> 00:42:45,876
- Guilty.
- Don't use that word.

564
00:42:47,211 --> 00:42:49,213
It's a long story. Never mind.

565
00:42:56,095 --> 00:43:00,265
- You're leaving, aren't you?
- Yeah, I'm afraid so.

566
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,519
- Do you really have to go?
- Well, I've fixed everything

567
00:43:03,686 --> 00:43:05,020
I came here to fix.

568
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,357
But I'll be back. Promise.

569
00:43:16,907 --> 00:43:19,743
Nothing could keep me
away from you too long.

570
00:43:28,835 --> 00:43:30,879
Well, at least he wasn't a warlock.

571
00:43:31,046 --> 00:43:36,134
Hey, you don't suppose Leo
was the...? What are you doing?

572
00:43:36,301 --> 00:43:38,303
Getting rid
of the relinquishment spell.

573
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:41,890
However we got our powers back,
I don't wanna risk losing them again.

574
00:43:42,057 --> 00:43:44,142
- I second that.
- Third.

575
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:46,269
So witches forever?

576
00:43:46,436 --> 00:43:49,397
And damn proud of it.
