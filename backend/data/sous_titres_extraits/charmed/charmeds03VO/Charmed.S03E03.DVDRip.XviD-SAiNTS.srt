0
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,598
- I knew you'd come back.
- Piper.

1
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,557
Phoebe was worried,
Prue was a wreck,

2
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,119
but I knew you'd find a way.

3
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,435
We need to talk.

4
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,353
Leo, you haven't kissed me
in a week.

5
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,476
Don't you think maybe
that takes priority?

6
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,840
- I came to say goodbye.
- What?

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,833
They told us to break up.
They caught us trying to get married.

8
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,998
So we won't get married. We'll wait.

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,919
It's too late, we broke the rules.

10
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,957
Now they won't let us
see each other again.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,037
Wait a minute. They won't what?

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,474
I don't care what they do to me,

13
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,995
but I couldn't bear
anything happening to you.

14
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,116
I shouldn't even be here right now.

15
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,792
Wait a minute. Leo, I can't hear you.
What are you saying?

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,076
You have to forget about me.

17
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,391
Leo.

18
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,231
I love you.

19
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,591
Leo!

20
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,511
Leo!

21
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,319
Piper.

22
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,072
Piper.

23
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,350
Piper, wake up!

24
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,238
Piper.

25
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,790
Leo's not coming back.

26
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,671
Honey, it was just a bad dream.

27
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,994
No, it wasn't.

28
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,310
It was real.

29
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,349
I don't understand.

30
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,755
Why are they doing this to us?

31
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,555
It's like destroying lives is how
they amuse themselves.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,558
Piper, watch what you say.

33
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,194
Why? What are they
gonna do to me?

34
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,511
They couldn't hurt me more
than they already have.

35
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,755
Don't you just love cell phones.

36
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,393
Hey, it's me.

37
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,070
It's amazing how much stress you can
project with so few words, Prue.

38
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,595
I will have your precious car
home momentarily.

39
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,758
Phoebe, I am not calling about the car,
I'm calling about Piper.

40
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,592
Look...

41
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,432
...she had this dream about Leo.

42
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,353
And maybe I'm overreacting,
but I've never seen her like this.

43
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,239
It's... It's like she's
completely given up.

44
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,953
What kind of dream about Leo?

45
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,469
Phoebe?

46
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,790
I'm fine, the car's fine,
I'll see you later, bye.

47
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,633
Hi. Are you okay?

48
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,997
You can't have it!
Leave me alone!

49
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,838
I won't give it to you!
Leave me alone!

50
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,114
It's okay, it's okay.
You're safe. You're safe.

51
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,471
Okay.

52
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,952
You just have to be very careful
because it's hot, so blow on it, okay?

53
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,429
Hey, did you find out
anything more from her?

54
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,193
Name, rank and serial number.

55
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,279
Her parents are on the way,
they live up the street.

56
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,908
They were very worried about you.

57
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,590
I'm gonna go to the car
and get her jacket.

58
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,876
- Keys?
- What?

59
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,435
You know, silver shiny things
that go jingle-jingle?

60
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,073
I don't have them.

61
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,274
That's so weird.
I put them up here.

62
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,952
The fairies probably hid them.

63
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,952
What was that?

64
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,192
Sorry. I'm not supposed
to talk about fairies.

65
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,519
You know what? In this house,
you can talk about anything you want.

66
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,399
Sometimes we talk about
weird things too.

67
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,869
Well, that's what fairies do.

68
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,951
Hide your keys and things.

69
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,718
They're tricky like that.

70
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,029
Is that what's in that box?

71
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,195
Is it a fairy?

72
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,953
Is that who you're protecting?

73
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,192
That's probably your
mom and your dad.

74
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,154
He's not my dad.

75
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,914
He's just my mom's new husband.

76
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,195
- Hi, we're Kate's parents.
- Is she all right?

77
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,039
Yeah, she's fine. I mean,
she scraped her arm a little bit,

78
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,753
but mostly she's just scared.

79
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,069
Kate?

80
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,635
- Get out of the doorway.
- Kate.

81
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,229
It's an in-between.
Get out of the in-between.

82
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,677
- What's an in-between?
- Where the trolls are.

83
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,077
Honey, we've had
this conversation before.

84
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,229
You're a big girl, and it's time to stop
believing in things like that.

85
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,712
She's had some problems
since her father and I divorced.

86
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,917
Regressed, sort of,
back to the imaginary-friends stage.

87
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,714
Look, we should go. It's late.

88
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,679
Thank you again, for everything.

89
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,839
They'll get us.

90
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,592
I won't let them.

91
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,631
It's okay.

92
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,677
Look, there it is!

93
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,950
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

94
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,236
Come on, Phoebe, trolls and fairies?
You don't believe that stuff.

95
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,311
Sure, why not?

96
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,398
Well, maybe it's time
we tell her about Santa.

97
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,599
All I know is something
was definitely after her.

98
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,994
But you didn't see anything?

99
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,918
No, but how else did she get hurt?

100
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,395
How about she fell down
and scratched herself?

101
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,398
No, Piper, they weren't scratches,
they were claw marks.

102
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,194
If they were, you would have seen
what had clawed her.

103
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,952
Why are you being
so stubborn about this?

104
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,957
Because I'm a Scorpio,
what's your excuse?

105
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,113
Okay, so it's kind of late,
and we're all a little bit tired.

106
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,793
So how about we finish
this up tomorrow?

107
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,918
Now look what you did. You went
and turned Prue into the middle child.

108
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,514
Okay, Phoebe.
Even if fairies and trolls do exist,

109
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,795
you heard what her mom said.

110
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,552
The problem started
when her father left.

111
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,839
- That's psychology, not magic.
- I know.

112
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,719
But you know what? I'm gonna check
the Book of Shadows, just in case.

113
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,758
Because I don't want to be
out-stubborned by a Gemini.

114
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,317
No, don't! The tweens!

115
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,351
They come out of the shadows.

116
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,718
Honey, just go to sleep, okay?

117
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,631
Please.

118
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,473
Go away.

119
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,158
Leave us alone.

120
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,472
Hey.

121
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,518
Check this out.

122
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,039
We each drew one.

123
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,191
- "Lily."
- Do you remember her?

124
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,828
She was our little imaginary friend
we had when we were kids.

125
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,630
I have not thought about Lily
in years.

126
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,912
That's because you grew up,
and you stopped seeing her.

127
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,478
Okay.

128
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,188
Fairies, elves and trolls
are mystical creatures

129
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,673
that live in a realm parallel to ours,
but separated by a thin veil.

130
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,831
The Enchanted Realm?

131
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,278
A thin veil which lifts only
in tween places. Tween places, Prue.

132
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,313
That's like a realm
in between two things.

133
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,193
Like doorways and windows,
shadows.

134
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,868
- Shadows?
- In between light and dark.

135
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,117
And It's exactly what Kate said,
trolls live in the in-between.

136
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,959
Right, but when you found Kate,
she wasn't in an in-between.

137
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,756
Actually, she was in the biggest
in-between of all: midnight.

138
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,475
"In the hour between night and day,
the world itself becomes a tween."

139
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,319
Okay, so why isn't there anything
in the Book of Shadows?

140
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,715
Because the Book of Shadows
was written by adults.

141
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,153
And I'm assuming that scary-Iooking
dude in your picture is a troll.

142
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,835
So then why is he trying
to hurt Kate?

143
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,477
I don't know, we have to ask Kate.

144
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,154
And we will fill Piper in on the way.

145
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,715
You know, maybe we should
just do this one on our own.

146
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,797
I mean, Piper's kind of out of it.

147
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,037
Even more reason to drag her along,
take her mind off of Leo.

148
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,270
Phoebe, phone!

149
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,832
- It's your little lawyer boyfriend.
- So there.

150
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,116
- And he is not my boyfriend.
- Weird.

151
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,113
- Hello?
- Who's not your boyfriend?

152
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,350
The mailman.

153
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,549
Yeah, sometimes Piper
likes to tease me

154
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,678
because I like to get the mail a lot.

155
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,239
So how are you?

156
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,228
Well, it's a beautiful morning and
I got a beautiful woman on the phone,

157
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,675
so things could be worse.

158
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,390
God, I sound like Billy Appleby.

159
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,914
- What?
- Nothing.

160
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,917
No, wait, what did you just say?

161
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,399
Billy Appleby is just this
hokey guy from this old movie

162
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,710
I watched too many times
when I was a kid.

163
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,319
Kill it Before it Dies.

164
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,795
- You've seen it?
- Once or twice.

165
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,949
Really?

166
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,235
Too bad it's not playing,
I'd take you to see it.

167
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,594
I love you.

168
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,910
Course we could always
have dinner instead.

169
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,190
Are you asking me out, counsellor?

170
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,277
Guilty.

171
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,672
How about tonight?

172
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,108
I could stop by your place.

173
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,591
Really? Well...

174
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,639
Actually tonight's not good because
Piper is going through something.

175
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,190
But I will call you and maybe we could
meet at the club, okay?

176
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,118
Sorry, bye.

177
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,515
Did you not look at those drawings?

178
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,829
They're cute, yes.

179
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,673
Cute? Cute?

180
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,189
We all had the same
invisible fairy friend, Piper.

181
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,476
That is proof that fairies exist.

182
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,794
Or...

183
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,958
...it proves that one of us
had a really fertile imagination,

184
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,395
and the other two
were really good copycats.

185
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,031
Okay, Piper, honey,
just listen to me, okay?

186
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,118
We think that Kate's in trouble.
Our kind of trouble.

187
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,473
Okay, well I don't.

188
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,232
And after what they did to Leo,

189
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,676
I'm not really all that motivated
to go dig up demons for them.

190
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,793
- Trolls.
- Whatever.

191
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,594
Look, you guys can do
whatever you want,

192
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,876
but I've had it, and I'm done.

193
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,716
- What does that mean?
- That means that the powers that be

194
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,075
haven't done anything
but ruin my life,

195
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,437
so therefore I'm not gonna do anything
for them anymore, okay?

196
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,513
I'm going now.
Excuse me. I'm going now.

197
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,030
I think she's on strike.

198
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,479
Kate, someone's here to see you.

199
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,593
Hey.

200
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,435
So we brought you your jacket.

201
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,630
We had to use the spare key
to get into the car, though.

202
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,717
I guess the fairies hid them after all.

203
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,115
Told you.

204
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,158
What are you drawing?
That looks like a very scary cave.

205
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,198
You know, that looks a lot like mine.

206
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,918
That's a fairy and a troll.

207
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,793
My mom says I'm making them up,
but I'm not.

208
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,397
We believe you.

209
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,717
We just need you to tell us everything
that you know so we can help.

210
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,479
I don't know that much.

211
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,517
Thistle's kind of hard to understand.

212
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,671
Fairies don't talk the same way
people do.

213
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,514
- Thistle?
- I saved her.

214
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,240
See, the fairies are the bosses
of the enchanted kingdom,

215
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,311
but the trolls wish
they were the bosses.

216
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,278
So they kidnapped Thistle from
the king and queen of the fairies.

217
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,398
So Thistle is a princess?

218
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,315
But the trolls are gonna kill her unless
her parents hand over the kingdom.

219
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,279
It's a miniature coup d'état.

220
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,833
But I found her tied up in a cave
and I saved her.

221
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,878
That was very brave of you.

222
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,353
But now the trolls hate me
because I won't give her back.

223
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,114
Most of the time, I can stay out
of the in-betweens,

224
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,919
- but at midnight...
- There's no place to hide.

225
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,838
Yeah, we know.

226
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,920
Can we see her?

227
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,478
No, only children can see fairies.

228
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,997
Well, I don't know if this
is gonna help at all,

229
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,392
but Prue and I, we're very in touch
with our inner children.

230
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,433
Can we at least try?

231
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,556
We'll have to go into an in-between.

232
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,358
Watch out for trolls.

233
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,398
Okay.

234
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,199
Can't help if you can't see her.

235
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,511
Thistle says that if you
really believe in fairies,

236
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,355
there's something that'll make you
innocent again so you can see them.

237
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,873
I think it worked.

238
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,839
I wanna see the fairy.

239
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,036
If you're happy and you know it
Clap your hands

240
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,472
If you're happy and you know it
Pat your knee

241
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,159
Oh, my God.

242
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,471
- Pat your knee
- You guys gotta do it.

243
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,434
If you're happy and you know it
Then your face will surely show it

244
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,919
If you're happy and you...

245
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,469
- What the hell is going on?
- You think this is bad?

246
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,676
You should have been here
for "Frere Jacques."

247
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,394
They've been acting like kids
since they got here.

248
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,796
I didn't serve them, I swear.

249
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,356
All right, put on some music,
any music, and kill that microphone.

250
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,878
If you're happy and you know it
Spin around

251
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,553
- Hi.
- Hi.

252
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,789
Lost your minds?

253
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,594
Piper, we have been waiting
and waiting and waiting...

254
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,228
And you know what we did? We saw
a fairy and she was very cute

255
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,710
and she was sparkly
and she was really, really pretty.

256
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,674
Okay. What ass-backward spell
did you guys cast?

257
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,595
- We... We didn't cast a spell.
- No, it is true, we did not cast a spell.

258
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,478
But we did use fairy dust.

259
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,399
- Fairy dust.
- Yes.

260
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,314
Okay, great. So you can go home now
and reverse it, Tinker Bell.

261
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,235
No, no. No, I am not a fairy.

262
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,073
She thought I was a...
We have to show her.

263
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,993
- Okay. Yeah.
- Ready? Okay, go.

264
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,151
One, two, three!

265
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,830
What the hell did you do that for?

266
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,033
That did not work!

267
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,879
No. Work.

268
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,315
That's a very good idea.
I'm gonna go back to work now.

269
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,075
Hey, you know what?

270
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:56,157
You are being a big, big, big,
extra, extra, double big jerk right now!

271
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,272
Because now I have the key,
so Thistle is safe.

272
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,670
And we have to be back
with Kate at midnight

273
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,757
- so when the trolls attack...
- No.

274
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,359
You guys are going home.

275
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,794
And you're not driving either,

276
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,315
because someone will think
you're drunk or something.

277
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,717
So go outside and wait there,
and I will call a cab.

278
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,388
- Now, just...
- No.

279
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,239
Why are you being mean?

280
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,919
I know what you're trying to...
Stop it!

281
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,874
You're trying to trick me into ending
my strike, and it's not gonna work.

282
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,600
- You guys go home! Scoot! And go!
- We love you!

283
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,959
Scoot. You go home and you reverse
this ridiculous behaviour.

284
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,951
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

285
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,759
The trolls. They must know
that we have the key now.

286
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,114
Okay, they're very scary,

287
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,352
but they're gonna come after us
instead of Kate at midnight,

288
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,829
so all's we have to do is go home
and wait for them.

289
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,558
Okay.

290
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,357
Jeez Louise, there are too many
doorways in this house!

291
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,751
Okay. We have to call Kate
on the walkie-talkies, okay?

292
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,030
Do you think trolls
know about doorbells?

293
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,792
I don't know.

294
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,874
Cole!

295
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,957
Hey!

296
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,832
- You're home.
- Yes.

297
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,069
Tween!

298
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,912
Excuse me, but you were not
supposed to meet me here.

299
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,435
You were supposed to meet me
at the club, remember?

300
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,075
- Was that the plan?
- Yes, that was the plan.

301
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,513
Sorry, long day.

302
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,278
Okay, bye.
Close the door behind you.

303
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,317
- Bye.
- Bye!

304
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,316
It's a long drive home. Do you think
I could use your restroom?

305
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,950
Number one or number two?

306
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,675
- He has to go tootie.
- Excuse me?

307
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,509
Okay, you can come in but you
have to do it very fast, whatever it is.

308
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,989
Kate, Kate, come in! It's Prue.

309
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,077
Come in, Kate.

310
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,189
- Kate, are you there?
- Prue, where are you?

311
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,914
We're at home,
the dust didn't work on Piper.

312
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,678
Then she doesn't believe.

313
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,068
What are we gonna do?

314
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,755
I'm scared, there's shadows
everywhere and it's almost midnight.

315
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,759
Okay, listen, Kate, okay.
You don't have to worry.

316
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,239
That's what we called to tell you.

317
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,874
Because the trolls know
that we have the key now.

318
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,072
They're not after you anymore,
they're after us.

319
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,396
No, they're here too.
I can hear them.

320
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,433
As long as we have the key,
Thistle is safe.

321
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,875
So just stay there

322
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,079
and turn on all the lights
and it'll disappear the shadows.

323
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,275
Yeah. Yeah.

324
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,715
Trolls.

325
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,671
Let's go get them.

326
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,032
Prue. That was a very, very big troll.

327
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,350
That wasn't a troll,
that was a demon!

328
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,715
Okay, well, where does he
fit into the story?

329
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,599
- He was after the Book of Shadows.
- All right, well, you know what,

330
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,349
we can't really worry about him right
now because we have to get to Kate.

331
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,832
Phoebe!

332
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,749
Phoebe! Look out!

333
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,077
Prue. They got the key.

334
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,189
Phoebe.

335
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,508
Are you two okay?

336
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,672
Hey, you know what, can you just go?
I'm really sorry to rush you out,

337
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,149
but we have something very important
to be taking care of.

338
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,709
You sure you're okay?
I mean, that sounded like a nasty fall.

339
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,156
- Yeah, Cole, we're fine, really.
- You two seem different.

340
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,952
- Different?
- I mean,

341
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,230
I thought maybe you were drunk
or something before,

342
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,436
- but how you seem...
- Sober.

343
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,794
Stairs can be sobering.

344
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,590
Right. Okay.

345
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,399
I'm really sorry about
our plans there, Cole.

346
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,357
I really am.

347
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,678
No worries. I'll keep trying.

348
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,309
"Stairs can be sobering"?

349
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,112
Okay, what was I supposed to say?

350
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,078
That some unknown demon came in
to try and steal our magic book,

351
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,033
and then little trolls came
and pushed us down the stairs?

352
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,115
Right. Okay, but why are we thinking
like grownups all of a sudden?

353
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,991
I don't know, it must have been
from the trauma of the attack.

354
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,394
Which is probably a good thing.

355
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,836
I don't think our inner children would
have had a lot of luck protecting Kate.

356
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,476
And now that the trolls have the key,
we really need to go protect Kate.

357
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,317
Hello, Prue?

358
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,914
Okay, I don't understand
why we just don't get to Kate.

359
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,878
Because with the dust worn off,
we won't be able to see the trolls.

360
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,156
Okay, well I already looked
in the Book of Shadows,

361
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,958
and there's nothing in there
about trolls.

362
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,436
I know, I'm thinking of piecing together
a makeshift spell like...

363
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,313
Here. "To See What Can't Be Seen."

364
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,790
If we combine that one with the one
to cultivate innocence

365
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,951
and the power of three spell,
it just might work.

366
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,714
That's why you're the older sister,
you are always thinking.

367
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,717
Thank you. All right,
I'll work on the spell,

368
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,916
why don't you go call Piper, okay?

369
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,274
What's the point of that?
Isn't she still on the picket line?

370
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,391
Yeah, but we can't fight the trolls
without her.

371
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,596
They're just too fast.
We need her to freeze them.

372
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,230
You know, we may have wanted her
to be with us before

373
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,153
- but now we actually need her.
- Okay.

374
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,117
Hey, watch out for doorways
and stuff.

375
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,709
Because now that the trolls know
that we're helping Kate,

376
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,838
they'll do everything they can
to stop all three of us.

377
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,237
Hey, Piper, your sister's
on the phone.

378
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,628
Perfect.

379
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,553
It's okay, I'll get it, I'll get it.
It's all right.

380
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,389
- Need a diaper change?
- Very funny.

381
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,472
Look, we need you to come home
right away. By midnight, or else...

382
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,478
The tooth fairy is gonna come
and harass us all for not flossing?

383
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,672
All right, I know you don't believe
in fairies, and I'm not asking you to.

384
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,995
Then what are you asking?

385
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,633
We were trying
to distract you before.

386
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,631
We were trying to take
your mind off Leo, okay?

387
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,791
And it was wrong,
and I'm sorry for that.

388
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,951
But it's not
about that anymore, Piper.

389
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,152
We are up against something
that we cannot fight without you.

390
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,635
Trolls?

391
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,514
Believe it or don't,
but they are sneaky and mean

392
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,672
and they're trying to hurt
a seven-year-old girl.

393
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,719
Hello?

394
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,950
Any chance they may have
been here?

395
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,714
Yeah, one attacked me
there earlier, why?

396
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,748
Nothing.

397
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,552
All right, they know
that we're witches.

398
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,280
And they will do anything
to stop us from helping Kate.

399
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,152
All right, all right. I'm on my way.

400
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,914
Okay. Well, don't forget
to stay out of the...

401
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,357
...tween places.

402
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,429
Abbey, have you seen my keys?

403
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,675
Aren't they on the hook?

404
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,679
No, if they were on the hook,
I wouldn't be asking.

405
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,990
- Oh, I got it, I got it!
- Damn it!

406
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,391
Spare key, spare key.

407
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,754
Register.

408
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,269
Son of a...

409
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,959
Oh, are you okay?

410
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,517
Would you just do me a favour
and close up for me?

411
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,278
Oh, yeah sure.

412
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,037
Thank you.

413
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,351
You better run while you can,
you little rodents.

414
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,757
I bet you guys think this is
real funny, don't you?

415
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,478
Haven't you taken enough from me?

416
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,191
You have to send trolls
to kick me while I'm down?

417
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,875
I had a nice normal life once.

418
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,155
And you took that from me.

419
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,390
You took my boyfriend,
you took my life,

420
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:58,317
the least you could do is leave me
my freaking car keys!

421
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,275
I am a good person.
I'm a good witch.

422
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,477
And damn it, I would have made
a great wife.

423
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,393
And how dare you
take that from me.

424
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,949
I deserve... No, you know what?

425
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,910
I demand that you send him
back to me.

426
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,559
You hear me? Right now!

427
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:23,113
I'm going to stand in this very spot
until you send Leo back to me.

428
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,992
She said that she was coming, right?

429
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,991
What, did you think I just
made that part up?

430
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,674
No, but it is almost 12, and we still
have to go over to Kate's.

431
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,353
Well, maybe we should do it
without her.

432
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,509
Do the best we can.

433
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,234
No, I used the power of three spell,
it won't work without her.

434
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,152
- We can rewrite it.
- In six minutes?

435
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,395
Do you have a better idea?

436
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,791
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

437
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,599
- Are you okay?
- I thought this wasn't about me.

438
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,673
Well, it just...

439
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,637
You don't really seem like
you're very open.

440
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,910
I'm as open as I'm gonna get
in the next five minutes,

441
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,593
so let's just do the damn spell.

442
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:13,355
In this tween time, this darkest hour
We call upon the sacred power

443
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,354
Three together, stand alone
Command the unseen to be shown

444
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,911
In innocence, we search the skies
Enchanted are our newfound eyes

445
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,036
You have really gotta lay off
the rhyming, Prue.

446
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,916
All right, well, let's just go
ring the doorbell.

447
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,674
Piper, you freeze Kate's parents
so we can get past them, okay?

448
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,398
Fine. Whatever.

449
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,629
"Fine. Whatever."

450
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,115
Prue? Hello?

451
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,269
Phoebe?

452
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,353
Please answer me.

453
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,589
Hello?

454
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,509
Phoebe!

455
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,995
Phoebe, they're taking Thistle!

456
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,359
Okay, why couldn't we see them?

457
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,551
Obviously, the spell didn't work.

458
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,798
Help me!

459
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,071
Oh, no.

460
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,757
Where did she go?

461
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,638
There is nothing here.

462
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,633
Well, she's gotta be here somewhere.
She couldn't have just disappeared.

463
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,315
Unless the trolls turned her
into a fairy?

464
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,874
A fairy? Why would they do that?

465
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,595
I have no idea.
Maybe to punish her for taking Thistle.

466
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,671
But we have to find Kate.

467
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,434
Okay, come on,
give me a premonition.

468
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,074
I don't understand.

469
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,958
I mean, why couldn't
we see the trolls?

470
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,476
We've had spells backfire on us
before, but never the power of three.

471
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,271
It didn't backfire.

472
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,955
The spell didn't work because of me.

473
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,556
- Piper.
- No, it's... It's true.

474
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,756
This is all my fault.

475
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,633
I just...

476
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,395
I wanted to save Kate,
I never meant to hurt her.

477
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,790
I never meant for this to...

478
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,550
Hey, don't blame yourself, okay?

479
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,836
I mean, you have every right
to be angry.

480
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,230
But not at the expense of a little girl.

481
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,594
I just don't understand

482
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,752
how I'm supposed to believe
in anything anymore.

483
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,035
I just want him back, Prue.

484
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,593
I know.

485
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,790
But right now we have to
get Kate back, okay?

486
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,632
And we're gonna need your help
to do that.

487
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,950
Damn it. Damn it, damn it!

488
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:18,557
I don't understand. What good is this
power if I can't use it when I need it?

489
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,478
Phoebe, you have to focus.

490
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,796
Oh, Prue, I am focusing,
believe me.

491
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,878
You're too upset, so take
a deep breath and try again.

492
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,110
I can't levitate when I want to,
I can't premonition...

493
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,918
- Guys!
- What?

494
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,788
I think the spell is working.

495
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,838
Do you see it?

496
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,477
What's it doing?

497
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,108
I think it wants us to follow it.

498
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,076
I think he got scared away.

499
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,999
Yeah, and I can see why. This looks
like the cave from Kate's drawing.

500
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,673
First troll I see is in really big trouble.
Let's go.

501
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,755
Troll central.

502
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,399
- What are they doing?
- Looks like they're trying to start a fire,

503
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,160
although I don't really think
that it's for roasting marshmallows.

504
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,588
Kate and Thistle.

505
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,629
Piper, do you think that you can
freeze them from here?

506
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,239
I can try.

507
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,436
- Piper, freeze them!
- They're too fast.

508
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,190
- One down.
- Oh, Kate!

509
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,913
Okay.

510
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,077
- Prue, a little help here!
- Okay.

511
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,436
- Piper, run.
- Run? Run where?

512
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,792
- Piper, run!
- Are you out of your mind?

513
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,632
Freeze the flames!

514
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,953
Unfreeze. Now.

515
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,996
Now, that is just the way I like
my trolls, medium well.

516
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,590
Hi. Here you guys go.

517
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,795
It's okay.

518
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,678
There you go.

519
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,790
Hey. Hey, you guys, wait up!

520
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,597
Thistle, don't you know how to turn
Kate back into a person?

521
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,748
Kate, you know,
you can't stay a fairy,

522
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,593
because if you do,
your mom will be very sad.

523
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,835
You know what?

524
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,753
I think I kind of know
how you're feeling.

525
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,672
When someone you love
goes away,

526
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,515
it doesn't make any sense, and you feel
like the whole world is out to get you.

527
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,559
But you know what?

528
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,320
Your mom and dad
didn't split up to hurt you.

529
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,796
Things just happen.

530
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,872
Things that you may
never understand.

531
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,391
But you just have to believe
that it's for the best.

532
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,511
Even if it doesn't always
seem that way.

533
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,519
You remember how sad you were
when your daddy left?

534
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,517
Well, that's how sad everybody's
gonna be if you don't come home.

535
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,877
Nicely done.

536
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,675
Yep.

537
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,990
- Ice?
- Bed.

538
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,076
Who delivers at this hour?

539
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,190
I think that this is someone's way
of saying thank you.

540
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,278
- Oh, here.
- Thank you.

541
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,476
Well, you're welcome.

542
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,509
Oh, they're so pretty.

543
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,996
Piper, we...

544
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,998
We...

545
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,918
- We just...
- I know.

546
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,348
It's okay.

547
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,112
I'm actually beginning to understand

548
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,829
why they don't want witches
and whitelighters to be together.

549
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,118
Marriage is hard enough, you know.

550
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,189
But marriage to a whitelighter...

551
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,037
He's gotta orb out
at all times of the night.

552
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,351
And sometimes he's gone
for weeks at a time.

553
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,909
But honestly,
if I'm gonna have a meltdown

554
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,152
every time I have no idea
where he is...

555
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,508
...then none of us are gonna
be able to do our jobs.

556
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,078
And if we had lost
that little girl tonight...

557
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,109
But we didn't.

558
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,388
But we could have.

559
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,388
And I don't think
I could live with that.

560
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,710
If that means that
I have to give up Leo...

561
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,197
...then I guess that's a sacrifice
I'm willing to make.

562
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,192
- Am I dreaming?
- No.

563
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,596
I had a dream that you weren't
coming back.

564
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,872
That wasn't a dream either, was it?

565
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,759
No, it wasn't.

566
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,715
They had forbidden me
from ever seeing you again.

567
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,952
But now...

568
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,076
I don't know what you said or did,

569
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,915
but they said you showed
great courage and great faith.

570
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,429
Enough to make them reconsider.

571
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,795
Does that mean you guys
could get married now?

572
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,598
What? I wanna know.

573
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,873
Not yet. It means they're giving us a
chance to prove we can make it work.

574
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,034
What do you mean, like probation?

575
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,950
Well, if we can show them
that our relationship

576
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,792
won't get in the way of our work...

577
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,274
Then we can stay together.

578
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,038
Right. But if anything goes wrong,

579
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,035
if we're distracted by each other
to the detriment of a single innocent...

580
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,633
We won't be.

581
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,439
- Are you worried?
- When are you going to learn?

582
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,874
I'm always worried.

583
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,672
I'm relieved that he's back though.
I mean not only for Piper but...

584
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,071
I know. Unknown unattractive
demon on the loose.

585
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,633
Let's not tell them till tomorrow.

586
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,512
I think that
the least that they deserve

587
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,148
is one night worry-free romance,
don't you?

588
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,431
Romance.

589
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,193
Turner.

590
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,792
Hi. Cole.

591
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,157
What are you doing in the office
at 2 in the morning?

592
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,595
What are you doing calling my office
at 2 in the morning?

593
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,870
I was just gonna
leave you a message.

594
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,349
Save you the trouble
of having to talk to me.

595
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,352
Why would I ever
not wanna talk to you?

596
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,476
l... I don't know, you know.

597
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,750
Just in case you thought I was
a drunk or a lunatic

598
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,480
or a drunk lunatic.

599
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,113
I think I'm gonna go with "mystery."

600
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,111
One I'm looking forward
to figuring out.

601
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,073
Okay.

602
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:08,319
I'm gonna go then
and be mysterious.

603
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,755
- I'll call you.
- I will answer.

604
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,232
Yes.

605
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,280
Tell them I'm getting closer.
