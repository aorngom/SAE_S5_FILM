00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:13,679
I hereby proclaim this tower of sand,
Kingdom Phoebe-ville.

1
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,874
You know, I don't get it.

2
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,989
Wait, what don't you get?

3
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,277
That you just spent
an hour of your life

4
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,115
building something that is
just gonna be completely...

5
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,192
Completely destroyed and disappear
in about five seconds flat.

6
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,352
But Phoebe-ville will live forever

7
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,149
in the hearts of the villagers
who came to love it.

8
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,389
What's with the
bah-humcastle attitude there?

9
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,549
What?

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,678
Well, the whole point of today
was to relax and have fun.

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,116
See, and I thought the point
was to give Piper and Leo

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,508
some alone married-people time,

13
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,591
since they decided to wait
on their honeymoon.

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,438
Okay, so you're sure nothing's wrong?

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,195
You know, the beach isn't exactly
my idea of a good time.

16
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,719
Prue, how is that possible?

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,429
Okay, well, you're too young
to remember,

18
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,751
but this is where Grams brought us

19
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,434
after Mom's funeral
to try and cheer us up.

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,029
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

21
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,590
No, but I know that you love the beach,
and I didn't wanna ruin it for you.

22
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,870
But something about the sand
and the ocean, you know,

23
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,268
it makes me angry.

24
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,471
Why does it make you angry?

25
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,794
Doesn't Mom's death
make you angry?

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,513
It makes me sad.

27
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,511
Well, I don't really do sad
that well, you know?

28
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,954
I didn't even cry at her funeral.

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,476
So seeing Mom at Piper's
wedding and now the beach...

30
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,558
Yeah. So I'm sorry
if I've been a little cranky.

31
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,273
Say no more.

32
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,000
Princess Prue has spoken!

33
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,475
By the orders of the queen...

34
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,238
- That's me.
- I got that part.

35
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,870
Phoebe-ville and all of its glory
will be abandoned

36
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,397
- for greener pastures and two lattes.
- Oh, all hail the queen.

37
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,828
I love to be hailed.

38
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,349
Hey!

39
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,916
No, no, no. Wait.

40
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,153
You okay?

41
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,228
There was this woman
and there was a shadow next to her.

42
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,873
Had to be demonic.

43
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,399
A shadow?
Like, what do you mean?

44
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,994
- Like a Woogie?
- No. Spookier. Way spookier.

45
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,559
I think I got pictures though.

46
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,318
So much for the lattes.

47
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,349
Looks like there's
a new demon in town.

48
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,236
So you're new in town.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,989
Yes.

50
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,873
And... And you would both
be living here?

51
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,519
Sure.

52
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,511
Yes, that's right.

53
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,874
Oh, don't get me wrong.

54
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,834
I'm fine with the whole
alternative-lifestyle thing.

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,353
I just don't like loud.

56
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,039
Well, you understand.

57
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,350
Don't like loud.

58
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,794
Got it.

59
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,679
Like the last tenant, Mr. Turner.

60
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,552
He was a little strange.

61
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,593
And then, of course,
he disappeared without a trace.

62
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,275
But he was nice and quiet,
so I liked him fine.

63
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,871
Without a trace.

64
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,239
Is that so?

65
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,119
There's demonic residue
all over this altar.

66
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,111
It's his, I can sense it.

67
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,430
There's what? What did you say?

68
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,353
Surely, you knew something
strange had happened here.

69
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,758
It is your responsibility to divulge
such things to prospective tenants.

70
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,393
Now, listen, I don't know anything...

71
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,751
And the fact that you failed
to show us the altar makes us wonder

72
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,748
what else about Cole Turner
you might be hiding

73
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,390
inside of that tiny,
human brain of yours.

74
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,511
Wait. I don't understand...

75
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,631
Don't try to talk.

76
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,075
Your brain stem
will do the talking for you.

77
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,514
- Is Belthazor alive?
- She didn't know,

78
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,790
but she knows someone who might.

79
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,472
Shouldn't I be wearing
white or something?

80
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,677
I mean, it is a whitelighter
reception and all.

81
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,638
Piper, what you have on is perfect.
You're beautiful.

82
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,071
All my friends are gonna love you,
if we could ever get there.

83
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,956
Fine. But I still don't understand
why my sisters can't come.

84
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,116
I mean, we could just do
a group hug thing, and...

85
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,959
I can orb you because you're my wife,
but I'm not a cosmic taxi

86
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,276
for the whole family.

87
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,039
You said wife.

88
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,149
All right. I'm as ready
as I'm ever gonna be.

89
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,193
Wait, what about Prue's
demon-Iooking, shadowy thingy?

90
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,072
Well, I promise
we'll be in calling distance

91
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,152
if any demon-Iooking,
shadowy thingy attacks.

92
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,709
All right, you two. Have fun.

93
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,359
Bring me back a cloud.

94
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,389
Pheebs?

95
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,874
Hey, I have to get to Morris,

96
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,270
see if he can help me
track down this woman.

97
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,710
- Why? What did you find?
- Nothing, that's the problem.

98
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,030
The shadow didn't show up
in any of the pictures.

99
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,152
- Really? That's weird.
- Anything in the Book?

100
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,157
No, nothing.

101
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,039
I didn't really have
a lot to go on though.

102
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,079
Inspector.

103
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,789
How can I help you?

104
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,911
You can tell me
where to find Cole Turner.

105
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,714
I know he's alive,
and I know he's in town.

106
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,278
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

107
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,755
You wanna know how?
Because his former landlady

108
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,876
was found brutally murdered
at his address.

109
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,232
Mrs. Owens.

110
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,393
Oh, my God. That's awful.

111
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,991
Awful like you can't imagine.

112
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,154
Cole didn't do this.
The Cole Turner I know wouldn't...

113
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,753
The Cole Turner you know?

114
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,871
That just doesn't sound
like the words of a woman

115
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,838
who claims her boyfriend left her
without a word four months ago.

116
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,034
I know what you're thinking.

117
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:19,038
And I know what this looks like.
And I am...

118
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,390
- I am so sorry for what happened to...
- You're sorry?

119
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,272
Her eyes were frozen open in terror.

120
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,756
Her skull was punctured in two places,
and by the time the police got there,

121
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,076
most of her brain
had spilled out onto the floor.

122
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,271
Be sick, be horrified.

123
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,034
But don't stand there
lying to me and say you're sorry.

124
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,073
All right, wait a second.
You're talking to her like she did it.

125
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,438
If she's lying to protect Turner,
then she might as well have.

126
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,715
Now, for the last time, where is he?

127
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,955
I'm gonna find him, Miss Halliwell,
and then I'm gonna bust his ass,

128
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,912
and then I'm gonna bust yours.

129
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,032
- You okay?
- He didn't do it, Prue.

130
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,599
I know he didn't do it.

131
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,433
Well, it's not me
that you have to convince.

132
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,838
Oh, my God.

133
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,956
That's her, the woman
from the beach.

134
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,836
All right, look. Do you see it?

135
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,953
No. All I see is Inspector Davidson
and the woman.

136
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,639
What does this mean?

137
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,432
Is he having her follow us?

138
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,591
I'm more concerned
about what's following her.

139
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,115
Wait, I don't understand
why you can't see it.

140
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,912
That doesn't matter, Prue, you can.

141
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,313
Do you think this has anything
to do with the landlady's death?

142
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,074
Well, it would be a pretty big
coincidence if it didn't.

143
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,956
I'm gonna follow her
and protect her from it.

144
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,832
If I'm the only one who can see it,

145
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,150
that must mean
that I'm meant to fight it.

146
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,828
All right, but the way the inspector
was describing the murder...

147
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,353
I know, I'll be careful.

148
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,075
Look, you should find Cole,
tell him what happened,

149
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,630
and see if he knows anything
about this shadow thing, okay?

150
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,313
All right, bye.

151
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,319
I'd better get out of here.

152
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,118
What? Why?

153
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,719
Because it's getting too dangerous.

154
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,313
So you're just gonna
disappear again?

155
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,799
If that's what it takes
to keep you safe.

156
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,509
What about keeping me sane, Cole?
I'm not gonna lose you again.

157
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,831
Some demon obviously knows
I'm alive, or at least suspects it.

158
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,837
Why else would they
have killed my landlady?

159
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,634
If they killed her, they'll kill
anybody they have to to get to me.

160
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,598
That is exactly why you cannot leave.
We have to stop them

161
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,756
before they hurt anybody else,

162
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,437
or before they hurt you.

163
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,076
They're after me, Phoebe.

164
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,438
This is my battle.

165
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,113
I'll handle it.

166
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,158
Cole,

167
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,353
I love you, and if holding onto that
means that I have to fight

168
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,637
a couple of extra demons
along the way,

169
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,869
then bring them on.

170
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,073
Unfortunately, we have no idea
what we're dealing with.

171
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,754
A strange shadow
that only Prue can see.

172
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,673
I haven't the slightest idea
what that could be.

173
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,796
So we'll figure it out...

174
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,112
...together.

175
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,515
It won't bring Mrs. Owens back,

176
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,874
but trust me, avenging
an innocent feels pretty damn good.

177
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,874
I don't see anything
remotely suspicious.

178
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,117
Unless you consider
hot-pink pedicures subversive.

179
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,428
You just keep doing
what you're doing.

180
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,034
You really think these women
are murderers?

181
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,395
I'm not sure what I think.

182
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,034
No. See, there's something
you're not telling me.

183
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,872
Look, I know I'm a rookie and all,

184
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,271
but I think I have a right to know
what I'm looking for here.

185
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,430
Look, Andrea,

186
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,752
I've seen things on this case that...
That aren't right.

187
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,114
That...

188
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,157
Look, I don't know what
I'm looking for, okay?

189
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,959
But until I do, I want you
to keep your distance

190
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,031
and just keep following
Phoebe Halliwell.

191
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,471
So why don't you take
the night off, go home,

192
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,517
and get some sleep for Pete's sake?

193
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,478
No, no, no. I can't.
Not till this is over.

194
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,075
I'll tell you what. You drop the
photos off on my desk and go home.

195
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,475
And you can pick it up
again tomorrow.

196
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,631
- Reece.
- That's an order.

197
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,398
- Have a good night.
- All right. You too.

198
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,913
- Oh, God.
- You okay?

199
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,399
Try not to touch anything. You don't
wanna leave your fingerprints.

200
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,155
- But if I wanna get a premonition...
- Use the back of your hand.

201
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,429
Did you find something?

202
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,511
It's just this place.

203
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,750
It's strange to be back here.

204
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,149
I know. It's strange for me too.

205
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,436
This was the first taste
I ever had of a normal life.

206
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,195
There were mornings
I'd wake up next to you, and...

207
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,793
...I didn't feel evil.

208
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,398
I was just a guy in love
with a beautiful girl.

209
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,156
I wanted it so much...

210
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,637
...I started to believe my own lie.

211
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,153
That's not a lie anymore.

212
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,071
We can have that.

213
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,354
We can have a life together.

214
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,350
- How?
- Well...

215
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,790
...by taking out the bad guys
who wanna take it away from us.

216
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,598
What do you see?

217
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,071
Prue.

218
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,992
She turned her back.

219
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,116
Why didn't she do anything
to stop them?

220
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,470
Stop who?

221
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,639
Demons.

222
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,955
They sort of had vampire teeth,
and they were floating.

223
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,513
They were killing Davidson.

224
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,919
I know them. They're seekers.

225
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,436
They have ways
of gathering information fast.

226
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,716
- Really fast.
- Do you know how to vanquish them?

227
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,909
No.

228
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,111
Well, let's hope
the Book of Shadows does.

229
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,989
Oh, my God.

230
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,394
Oh, you startled me.

231
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,438
Are you waiting
for Inspector Davidson?

232
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,437
Are you expecting him?

233
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,633
Not tonight. He's in the field.

234
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,593
- Where?
- I'm sorry.

235
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,275
I don't know.

236
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,472
Are you sure about that?

237
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,839
- What did she know?
- Nothing.

238
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,712
He told her nothing.

239
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,559
Which means he definitely
knows something.

240
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,272
I'm beyond your powers.

241
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,077
It's time.

242
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,515
Who are you?

243
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,233
I'm Death.

244
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,632
And I'll be back.

245
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,557
Here it is.

246
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,549
"The seekers.

247
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,872
They gather information by feeding
on their victims' brain-stem cells."

248
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,275
- Lovely.
- Which means my landlady

249
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,671
must've talked to Inspector Davidson
about me. That's why they're after him.

250
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:21,197
Does it say anything about demons
taking on shadow form?

251
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,914
No, but it does have a vanquish.

252
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,672
- Do you wanna see it?
- Oh, no, no. No.

253
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,835
Last time I touched that book,
it electrocuted me.

254
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,749
Yeah, well, maybe that's because
your intentions were evil.

255
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,912
Maybe it knows now
that you're trying to be good.

256
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,348
Better safe than sorry.

257
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,114
Oh, all right, I need the Book.

258
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,232
Wait a second, what is he
doing here next to it?

259
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,317
Keeping my distance, don't worry.

260
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,878
Pardon the potential
understatement of a cliché,

261
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,473
but you look like
you've seen a ghost.

262
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,240
Yeah, among other things.
I lost my innocent.

263
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,038
- Davidson?
- No, his partner.

264
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,515
She was out of my sight
for two seconds and they got her.

265
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,551
Was that them?

266
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,432
Yeah, actually, I think so.

267
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,477
And they're demonic lie detectors.

268
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,232
Only no one survives their test.

269
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,670
They killed Mrs. Owens
and now they're after Davidson.

270
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,074
To get to you.

271
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,838
Yes, to get to me.

272
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,239
- I should deal with this on my own.
- No. You can't.

273
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,670
You know, it's...
You said it yourself.

274
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,319
You don't know
how to vanquish them.

275
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,157
Unfortunately, this isn't
the only evil we're up against either.

276
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,590
- You mean the shadow?
- Oh, yeah.

277
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,028
Leo.

278
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,111
Leo.

279
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,758
- What's with the lamp?
- Wedding present.

280
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,878
- Bright, isn't it?
- Yeah.

281
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,996
Leo, is there such a thing as Death?
I mean, the angel of death?

282
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,679
Yeah, sure.

283
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,434
- Why?
- Because I met him.

284
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,635
What? Are you kidding me?

285
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,031
Yeah, that's how the shadow
introduced himself to me

286
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,272
when he took Davidson's partner.
Then he said he would be back too,

287
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,271
I'm assuming, for Davidson.

288
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,789
- He's not working with the demons.
- No, he can't be.

289
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,154
The angel of death isn't evil.

290
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,554
The hell he isn't.

291
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,513
And if I can see him, that must mean
that I'm supposed to stop him.

292
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,073
Prue, you can't stop him.

293
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,032
The angel of death
always gets who he comes for.

294
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,959
Yeah, well, not this time. All right,
I need to get ahold of Davidson.

295
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,350
If I can get him here,
I can protect him better.

296
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,875
Hold it. Davidson,
as in Reece Davidson,

297
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,951
the DA investigator?
He's the innocent?

298
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,594
- Yeah, is there a problem?
- One great big giant one.

299
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,030
We can't protect him
without telling him we're witches.

300
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,674
Yeah, I know that, Piper,
but I don't care, okay?

301
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,274
I cannot stand by
and watch Death take that man.

302
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,268
But that's what you do,
at least according to my premonition.

303
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,192
You turn your back
when the demons attack.

304
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,193
No, that doesn't make any sense.

305
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,913
I know, but it's what I saw.

306
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,509
Yeah, well, then you saw wrong.

307
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,830
I am not gonna let Death
take any more of my innocents.

308
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,073
I'm tired of losing people. So, Phoebe,
do you have Davidson's card?

309
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,958
Excuse me.

310
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,552
I thought I was
protecting her, man, but...

311
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,676
You all right, inspector?

312
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,400
I should've warned her.
Man, I should've told her everything.

313
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,949
What exactly should
you have told her?

314
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,274
Look, all that matters is I'm gonna
take down the guy who did this,

315
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,955
okay, no matter what.
If it's the last thing I do.

316
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,917
I gotta take this.

317
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,390
Forget about the Halliwells.
It's me you're after.

318
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,438
I'll tell you whatever you wanna know,
I promise. Not here, it's not safe.

319
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,318
Don't touch me.
You're under arrest, Turner,

320
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,789
- and I'm gonna personally see to it...!
- Wait.

321
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,556
What to you mean wait?

322
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,277
- Did you sense that?
- Belthazor's alive.

323
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,954
I'm sorry,
but it was our only chance.

324
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,519
They might be able to track me

325
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,353
but they'll have a hard time
sensing me in a cemetery.

326
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,198
How...? How did we get...?

327
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,078
What...? What the hell
is happening?

328
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,191
What's happening to me?

329
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,029
Just breathe. Try to calm down.

330
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,997
What are you?

331
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,959
Someone who just saved your life.

332
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,359
Try to calm down, inspector.

333
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,199
If I were a murderer,
I'd have killed you by now.

334
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,676
Just... Just let me go then.

335
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,512
I'll just walk away.

336
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,798
I can't do that.

337
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,358
If the demons get to you,
they'll find out the way to get to me

338
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,670
is to kill Phoebe,

339
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,274
and I can't let that happen.

340
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,556
When... When you
say demon, you...

341
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,671
I don't mean as a metaphor.

342
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,758
Okay, Davidson
won't answer our page.

343
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,195
Something must have
happened to him.

344
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,352
- Cole's gone.
- What do you mean "gone"?

345
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,755
I mean, he's not here.
I looked everywhere.

346
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,838
He must've gone after
Davidson alone to protect us.

347
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,315
Yeah, but if the seekers
get to him first...

348
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,436
We gotta get Cole
to bring him back here.

349
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,393
The mausoleum. He could've
taken him to the mausoleum.

350
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,869
- That's where Cole stays.
- Is there any chance

351
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,191
that's where you saw the
inspector die in your premonition?

352
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,839
Maybe. Let's go.

353
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,831
You know, I could
astral there faster.

354
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,195
But what if the demons show up?
You can't vanquish them.

355
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,158
- You'll need the power of three spell.
- So then I won't vanquish them.

356
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,788
I'll just protect Reece long enough
to get him out of there.

357
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,989
- Prue.
- Phoebe,

358
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,832
your premonition
is not gonna come true.

359
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,477
I told you, this is one fight
that Death is not gonna win.

360
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,795
Just stay the hell away from me.

361
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,838
I told you, I'm not gonna hurt you.

362
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,111
Belthazor, I presume.

363
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,868
I'm sorry, who?

364
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,479
We sensed your shimmer.

365
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,437
You're losing your touch.

366
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,115
Leave him out of this.

367
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,714
Why would we want him
now that we have you?

368
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,429
Unless the human knows something
Belthazor doesn't want us to know.

369
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,238
- Hi. Need a little help?
- What are you doing here?

370
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,638
How did you get here?
What the hell is going on?

371
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,068
Well, well, well.

372
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,590
The mighty Belthazor
in bed with a witch.

373
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,718
Don't make me sick.

374
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,313
- No.
- Prue!

375
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,234
Come on, fight,
you miserable coward.

376
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,671
Prue!

377
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,068
I never lose.

378
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,756
It's his time.

379
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,676
Over my dead body.

380
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,471
It's just so bright.

381
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,834
Well, of course, it's bright.

382
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,349
It's supposed to represent
the light of eternal love.

383
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,636
Wait, does that mean
we can never turn it off?

384
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,638
At this rate, you're gonna
turn it off in record time.

385
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,315
I'm just saying, I don't think
it belongs in the living room.

386
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,035
Or the parlour,
the dining room, the foyer.

387
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,950
- Pheebs?
- Oh, do you think I'm stupid?

388
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,918
- I'm staying out of this. Besides...
- I already told you, Prue.

389
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,954
I wouldn't revert to my demon form,
and I could've used some help.

390
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,673
I was busy saving Davidson.

391
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,319
No, that's what I was doing.

392
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,592
Hello? What happened?
Is he okay?

393
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,991
He almost wasn't. The seekers
were at the courthouse waiting for him.

394
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,391
And then they tracked Cole
to the mausoleum.

395
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,558
How do you know
they didn't track you here?

396
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,355
They retreated first. They have to be
close to a shimmer to track it.

397
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,238
- They retreated?
- Yeah.

398
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,158
- I kicked ass.
- No, you kicked air.

399
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,436
No, I told you that I was fighting
the angel of death,

400
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,828
and obviously, I won.

401
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,798
- Prue, that's not possible.
- Well, he's alive, isn't he?

402
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,673
For now, maybe.
But the seekers, they'll be back,

403
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,637
and they'll be out for blood,
mine and yours.

404
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,911
The only thing they don't know
is how to find us.

405
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,429
Yes, and now they know
that Davidson is the key.

406
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,198
If you had just fought with me, we...

407
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,868
You know, you're not exactly
the poster boy for teamwork, Cole.

408
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,799
Hey, you were supposed
to stick with us, remember?

409
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,797
I was trying to protect you.

410
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,513
All of you.

411
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,238
By exposing yourself?

412
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,319
Better me than you.

413
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,516
You know, the one thing
you failed to consider, Cole,

414
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,280
is no matter how dangerous
Davidson is to us,

415
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,113
- you're more dangerous.
- Now, wait a minute,

416
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:07,068
- I think that I've proven myself to you...
- No, Cole. That's not what she meant.

417
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,473
You're a part of our lives now.

418
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,878
You know almost
everything about us.

419
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,233
If you had lost...

420
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,356
The seekers could use
what I know to destroy you.

421
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,118
I better check with the Elders.
This is getting complicated.

422
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,193
- Inspector, you hit your head.
- I didn't hit it that hard.

423
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,389
Whatever I just saw,
it's not because I hit my head.

424
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,478
All right, look, I know
that this may seem hard to believe

425
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,432
after everything
you've been through tonight.

426
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,831
But we are on your side, okay?
We're the good guys.

427
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,036
I don't know what you people are,

428
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,316
but good isn't topping
my list of ideas.

429
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,789
Be that as it may,
we can't let you leave.

430
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,989
Cole.

431
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,991
- Try and stop me.
- Inspector, you're in a room

432
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,596
with three witches and a demon.
You really think that gun's gonna help?

433
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,678
Hey, look, I don't really
know how to tell you this,

434
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,790
but it's not just demons
that are after you.

435
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,872
The angel of death wants you too.

436
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,990
Now, please... Please,
if you stay here, we can protect you.

437
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,999
I'm not afraid of death.

438
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,589
You, on the other hand,
are a different matter.

439
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,352
Cole.

440
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,270
He's gonna expose you.
He'll gather evidence and...

441
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,274
Cole, we don't kidnap cops
and then hold them against their will.

442
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,119
But we do follow them
and protect them against their will.

443
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,078
Come on.
Not you, you stay here.

444
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,513
So, what, I'm just...?
I'm just gonna have to wait here?

445
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,514
Yeah, no shimmering,
and lock the door behind us.

446
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,312
- Prue?
- You guys go ahead.

447
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,954
- But the demons.
- Yeah, the demons are just pawns.

448
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,111
I'm going over their heads.

449
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,714
Spirits of air, sand and sea

450
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,678
Converge to set the angel free

451
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,513
In the wind I send this rhyme

452
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:17,595
Bring Death before me
Before my time

453
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,554
Come on.

454
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,631
I know that you can hear me.

455
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,791
Are you sure you really want me?

456
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,873
- I...
- Come on, I don't have all day.

457
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:34,113
There are people waiting,
who definitely don't have all day.

458
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,595
So, what is it?

459
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,438
I took your husband
and you want him back?

460
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,517
Your brother?

461
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,197
Your mother.

462
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,715
Don't talk about her.
Don't talk about my mother.

463
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,550
That should've been an easy guess
with those sad little-girl eyes.

464
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,674
All right, you want Reece Davidson,
and it's my job to protect him.

465
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,637
What do you want from me?
What do I have to do?

466
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,956
- That's not why you called me.
- Yes, it is.

467
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,031
No. That's an excuse.

468
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,191
You're mad at me
for taking Mummy.

469
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,152
I told you not to talk about her.

470
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,514
What were you, ten?

471
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,511
- I'm just guessing now.
- Just stop it.

472
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,079
Younger, I bet.

473
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,875
And now, you think by saving this...
Which is it, Davidson?

474
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,712
You think you'll have
beaten me somehow.

475
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,632
That somehow,
you'll have finally won.

476
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,392
- Just go away.
- No.

477
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,158
You wanted me, now you've got me.

478
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,232
- You're wasting precious time.
- I'm sorry...

479
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,278
It's not my time
you're wasting, it's yours.

480
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,112
You refuse to accept me
for what I am,

481
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,998
which keeps you from mourning me.

482
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,758
You don't know me.

483
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,990
You don't know anything about me.

484
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,270
But I've seen it
so many times before.

485
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,192
The anger, the pain.

486
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,309
You lock up your tears and
angrily steel yourself against me

487
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,357
as if I was the ultimate evil.

488
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,357
You are the ultimate evil.

489
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,990
No. I'm not good or evil,
I just am.

490
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,593
I'm inevitable.

491
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,312
What do I have to do
to save Davidson?

492
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,949
You still don't get it, do you?

493
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,712
There's nothing you can do.

494
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,036
I can't just let an innocent man die.

495
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,679
You have to let him die.

496
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,114
You have no choice.

497
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,550
And until you can learn
to accept that,

498
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,154
you'll just keep missing
the bigger picture.

499
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,079
What bigger picture?

500
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,553
I'll show you.

501
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,039
Oh, don't worry.

502
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,633
It's not your time.

503
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,952
Well, not just yet anyway.

504
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,109
"Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

505
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,238
I shall fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

506
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,073
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me."

507
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,315
Prue left right after we did.
She hasn't been back there?

508
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,994
No one's been here.
I'm going out of my mind.

509
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,191
Yeah, try sitting
in a car for 16 hours.

510
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,516
- No sign of any demons?
- No, not yet.

511
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,551
But Davidson led us to a...

512
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,069
- To a what?
- Never mind.

513
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,635
If Prue comes back,
just tell her to call us.

514
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,118
- I love you.
- Phoebe.

515
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,113
Phoebe.

516
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,878
Okay, so now what?

517
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,076
Well, we can't crash the funeral.

518
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,078
- I guess we just watch from here.
- I don't understand.

519
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,198
You tell a guy that Death is after him
and he goes to a cemetery?

520
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,072
How smart is that?

521
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,592
You want me? Fine.

522
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,952
But these people
have been through enough.

523
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,959
Phoebe.

524
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,398
Hey! Hey, Reece,
get out of there! Run!

525
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,594
You've been so brave, inspector.

526
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,113
Don't ruin it now.

527
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,634
Where's Belthazor?

528
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,677
Belthazor?

529
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,551
- Oh, my God.
- It's his time.

530
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,358
Just like it was your mother's time.

531
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,192
Prue.

532
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,510
Open the gate.

533
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,033
Stop fighting me.

534
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,593
Open the gate!

535
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,518
Prue?

536
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,953
- Are you okay?
- I don't know.

537
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,673
What happened?

538
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,991
- Did the demons do something to you?
- No.

539
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,832
How did you even get in here?

540
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,190
- Death brought me.
- I'm sorry.

541
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,831
You know, l... I don't completely
understand it myself.

542
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,153
Prue, how could you
stand there and let him die?

543
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:38,273
Because it was his time, all right?
I wanted to save him, but I couldn't.

544
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,799
You didn't even try.

545
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,835
I'm sorry.

546
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,918
I'm sorry.

547
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,191
I'm so sorry.

548
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,953
Ever hear of a doorbell?

549
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,553
We thought we'd surprise you.

550
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,914
Hi, we're not home.
You know the drill.

551
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,712
Cole, if you're there,
pick up the phone.

552
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,950
Actually, don't pick up
the phone. Just get out.

553
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,628
- Should I astral there?
- I think we should stick together.

554
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,792
Faster.

555
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,396
Now, let's see what
you don't want us to know.

556
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,431
Okay, come on. Come on.

557
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,515
Prue, don't.

558
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,311
Knowledge gained
By murderous means

559
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,959
Is wisdom's bitter enemy

560
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:14,033
The mind that burns with stolen fire
Will now become your funeral pyre

561
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,553
Well, at least we saved one.

562
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,553
Did you hear that?
You just reached innocent status.

563
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,517
And that's good?

564
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,792
To Prue, no one is more important.

565
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:50,353
- Nice timing. You missed the show.
- I know. But they told me to miss it.

566
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,078
- You okay?
- Yeah.

567
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,390
What do you mean
they told you to miss it?

568
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,352
The Elders were behind
this whole thing?

569
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,750
No, but they knew
they had to let Prue

570
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,673
learn the lesson by herself
the hard way.

571
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,959
- What lesson?
- That Death is not the evil.

572
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,551
- You okay?
- Yeah.

573
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,828
She just needs some time.

574
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,468
And we need a maid.

575
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,189
You know, I was thinking...

576
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,397
And this lamp
is not worth fighting over.

577
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,637
So if you love it, then I love it.

578
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,239
Yeah?

579
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,790
Yeah. I mean, life's too short.

580
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,989
Now I love it even more.

581
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,837
You contemplating the tides?

582
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,029
Can't control them
any more than me.

583
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,638
Okay, I get that you're not evil.

584
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:13,913
But what I don't get is why
I wasn't supposed to fight the demons.

585
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,917
Well, you were alone
and outnumbered.

586
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,908
I still could have fought.

587
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,875
But you would have lost, Prue.

588
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,113
How did you know my name?

589
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,473
I read it off my list.

590
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,829
It was the next one
after Reece Davidson.

591
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,075
You were coming for me?

592
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,038
If you hadn't stopped
fighting me, yes.

593
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,716
That's why you were able to see me.

594
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,876
It's the bigger picture, Prue.

595
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,075
Focusing all your anger against me
leaves you vulnerable

596
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,276
to the real evils of this world.

597
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,150
You'd do well to remember
that in the future.

598
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,033
- What?
- I don't know.

599
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,316
You know, I've been...

600
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,991
I've been mad at you for so long...

601
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,952
...ever since Mom died.
I don't know how else to be.

602
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,551
You grieve...

603
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,792
...and then you move on.
