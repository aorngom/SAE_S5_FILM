0
00:00:21,209 --> 00:00:23,677
All right, Dad, spill it.
What are we doing here?

1
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:26,761
What? Can't a father spend
a little quality time with his daughter?

2
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:28,726
Especially after all the time
we've been apart?

3
00:00:28,889 --> 00:00:30,402
All right, I take after you, okay?

4
00:00:30,569 --> 00:00:33,720
I've inherited all your tricks,
especially your fine art of fibbing.

5
00:00:33,889 --> 00:00:36,244
Don't know
what you're talking about.

6
00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:39,324
Tell me a little bit more
about this Leo fella, anyway.

7
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:40,683
How did he and Piper meet?

8
00:00:40,849 --> 00:00:45,320
Oh, it was a couple of years ago
at the house. He was our handyman.

9
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:47,241
Piper's marrying a handyman?

10
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:50,361
Well, no, he isn't really a handyman.

11
00:00:50,529 --> 00:00:53,282
- Wait, you do know that he's...?
- All I know is he's a nice enough guy

12
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:54,882
who seems to know
the big, bad secret.

13
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:57,768
Trust me, it's a lot better for a mortal
to know he's marrying a witch

14
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:00,966
before the wedding instead of after.
Wish I'd had that...

15
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:03,927
Mortal, right.

16
00:01:05,249 --> 00:01:07,080
What?

17
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:14,408
It's nothing. I guess that's why
they call it a ghost town, huh?

18
00:01:14,569 --> 00:01:16,480
What do you mean?
Did you actually see something?

19
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,404
What do you mean?

20
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:21,248
I mean like a premonition,
or whatever you call it.

21
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:23,643
All right, I confess.

22
00:01:23,809 --> 00:01:25,879
I brought you out here hoping
maybe you could give me

23
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:29,007
a little bit of your help.
I just didn't know how to ask.

24
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:30,244
Magical help? Dad...

25
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:32,400
Well, this place seemed like
such a good investment.

26
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:35,322
Too good, actually. Made me think
that all the stories were true.

27
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:37,087
I'm biting. What stories?

28
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:39,002
Ghost stories.

29
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:41,685
Something's been keeping people
from investing in

30
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:43,840
and razing this place
for over 100 years.

31
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:46,563
So, what, you want me to do
a little supernatural inspection?

32
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:48,839
I thought you could do
a little feng shui on the place

33
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,488
and see if there's anything going on.

34
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:52,680
Okay, first of all, I don't do feng shui.

35
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:55,363
And secondly, I can't always
get a premonition when I want to.

36
00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:01,126
- Okay, now, I definitely heard that.
- Heard what?

37
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:05,607
Okay, you didn't hear that?

38
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:10,727
You're a dead man, Bo.

39
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:12,282
Can you see them?

40
00:02:13,249 --> 00:02:14,568
See who?

41
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:19,642
- Hey! Hey! What's going on?
- Nobody crosses Mr. Sutter.

42
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,839
- Run, Geronimo!
- Phoebe.

43
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:35,640
Phoebe, what's going on?
Sweetheart, you're bleeding.

44
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:42,679
I wouldn't buy the place, Dad.
Really, really bad feng shui.

45
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:54,518
Wait a minute. We have
one too many place settings.

46
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:56,247
No, we don't.

47
00:03:56,409 --> 00:04:01,199
Okay, you, me, Leo, Phoebe, Dad.

48
00:04:01,369 --> 00:04:04,361
- That's five. We have six.
- So?

49
00:04:04,529 --> 00:04:06,884
So who is the sixth for?

50
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:10,005
Maybe...

51
00:04:10,809 --> 00:04:12,083
...Mom.

52
00:04:12,249 --> 00:04:13,477
What? It's my wedding.

53
00:04:13,649 --> 00:04:16,447
At least she can be here in spirit,
if nothing else.

54
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:18,600
Yes, she can be.

55
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,163
Looks great. When do we eat?

56
00:04:22,809 --> 00:04:24,686
Leo, can't you see
we're having a sister moment?

57
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,323
- Oh, sorry. Do you want me to go?
- No, I want you to help.

58
00:04:27,489 --> 00:04:29,207
This is your rehearsal dinner too,
you know.

59
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:32,526
So, Leo, you nervous? I mean,
only one more week before:

60
00:04:33,609 --> 00:04:35,486
- Thanks.
- Well, as long as no demons

61
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:38,004
come bursting through that door
until then, I'm fine.

62
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:39,403
Prue? Piper?

63
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:43,278
You had to jinx it.

64
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:47,518
Hey. Phoebe, what happened?

65
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:50,323
Oh, it's nothing. I'm fine.
I just need an aspirin.

66
00:04:50,809 --> 00:04:52,447
- Dad?
- I don't know what happened.

67
00:04:52,609 --> 00:04:53,598
We're just walking around,

68
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:56,158
- next thing I know, she's bleeding.
- I got into a bar brawl.

69
00:04:56,369 --> 00:04:58,758
Well, actually, I didn't,
two cowboys did.

70
00:04:58,929 --> 00:05:00,681
Bo and some other guy,
didn't catch his name.

71
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:03,317
But I think he's the bad guy
because he was wearing a black hat.

72
00:05:03,529 --> 00:05:06,805
- Oh, and they were transparent.
- She must have hit her head.

73
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:09,849
Sweetheart, I never would have
taken you there if I had any idea.

74
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,159
It's fine, Dad, really.
Don't worry about it.

75
00:05:12,369 --> 00:05:15,202
- Here, let me take care of that.
- No, I'm all right.

76
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:19,607
Dad, why don't you go to the porch
and get those town files.

77
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:22,721
You know, maybe there's something
in them that could actually help us.

78
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,800
All right.

79
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:31,239
Dad doesn't know
that Leo is a whitelighter.

80
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:32,723
- What?
- What?

81
00:05:32,929 --> 00:05:34,920
Well, I've been meaning to tell him,

82
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:37,723
but considering Mom had an affair
with her whitelighter,

83
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:40,005
I didn't think he'd really be
receptive to the idea.

84
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:42,325
Piper, he's gonna kill me
when he finds out.

85
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:44,724
Oh, don't be ridiculous,
you're already dead.

86
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:48,840
Just a lot of investment stuff.
Background info.

87
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:51,125
I don't see how it's gonna help
find out what happened.

88
00:05:51,489 --> 00:05:53,684
Well, you're the one that called it
a ghost town.

89
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:56,608
And since Bo fell through me
and I ended up

90
00:05:56,769 --> 00:05:58,805
with the same split lip that he had...

91
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:02,001
- Sounds like a ghost to me.
- Well, it can't be. Ghosts don't bleed.

92
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:04,522
I mean, so I've read. In books.

93
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:07,957
Obviously, it's not
my area of expertise.

94
00:06:08,929 --> 00:06:12,683
Mine either. What do you say we let
the supernatural stuff to the pros

95
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:14,168
and go grab a bite?

96
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:16,560
I don't know, Mr. Bennett.

97
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:19,607
"Victor," please. It's time
you called me Victor, son. Come on.

98
00:06:20,049 --> 00:06:22,688
I'm fine. Go ahead.

99
00:06:25,489 --> 00:06:27,286
Great, now I'm dead.

100
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:29,519
All right, why don't we just focus
on Phoebe

101
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,202
and try to figure out what happened.

102
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:34,202
- I'll get the Book.
- I'll get it. Maybe a drink.

103
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:40,048
So Phoebe says you're a handyman.

104
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:43,925
Actually, no, I'm a doctor.

105
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:47,280
I mean, not a "doctor" doctor, per se.
I'm more of, like, a counsellor doctor.

106
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,519
- I guide people.
- You make good money?

107
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:52,641
Honestly, no. It's more of a calling.

108
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,046
Leo, I think it's time to come clean.

109
00:06:57,809 --> 00:06:59,401
- You do?
- Yeah.

110
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:01,605
I need to talk to you
about something man-to-man.

111
00:07:02,049 --> 00:07:03,038
Man-to-man?

112
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:05,444
Well, from one mortal to another.

113
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,124
Leo...

114
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:09,925
...it's not easy being married
to a witch.

115
00:07:10,369 --> 00:07:11,563
- No?
- That's why my marriage

116
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:13,082
to Piper's mother didn't work out.

117
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:14,961
It wasn't because I didn't love her.

118
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:17,723
It's because I wasn't prepared
for what was to come.

119
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:21,527
Well, I think I'm prepared, sir...
I mean, Victor.

120
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:22,718
Don't get me wrong, Leo.

121
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:25,244
I want this marriage to succeed,
that's why I'm warning you.

122
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:29,608
But there are dangers out there
worse than demons and warlocks.

123
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:32,283
- You do know about them, don't you?
- Well, yeah, sure.

124
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:35,885
Well, the dangers I'm talking about
you're not even gonna see coming.

125
00:07:36,049 --> 00:07:39,644
The thing I'm talking about
will just sneak up on you

126
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:42,004
and destroy your marriage
if you're not careful.

127
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:45,605
Leo, do you know
what a whitelighter is?

128
00:07:55,169 --> 00:07:58,639
- What?
- Look, I have a huge bruise.

129
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:02,965
All right. Well, you must have
gotten that the same way

130
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:05,404
that you got the split lip. From Bo.

131
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:08,641
I don't get it. He gets beat up,
and I get his symptoms?

132
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:09,844
How is that possible?

133
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:12,407
I wish I knew what I was looking for.

134
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:14,639
I mean, if they're not ghosts,
then what are they?

135
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:17,886
Well, whatever it is, it's got something
to do with the history of that town.

136
00:08:18,049 --> 00:08:19,607
You said they were dressed
like cowboys?

137
00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:22,198
Yeah. Real cowboys,
right out of the Old West.

138
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:25,845
The outlaw said something to Bo
about a guy named Sutter.

139
00:08:26,049 --> 00:08:28,244
- Look him up. Maybe he's a demon.
- Wait a minute.

140
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:31,680
- Did you find something?
- It's more of what I'm not finding.

141
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:35,040
All right, nothing is dated
past April 25th, 1873.

142
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:37,968
The maps, the land grants,
death certificates.

143
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:39,767
It's almost like time just stopped.

144
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:42,085
What do you mean stopped?
Like everybody just died?

145
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,166
No, like stopped
moving forward, literally.

146
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:46,638
Wouldn't be the first time
we've come across a time loop.

147
00:08:46,849 --> 00:08:49,204
- No, we vanquished that demon.
- Wait a minute.

148
00:08:51,969 --> 00:08:54,324
Well, maybe it's not a demon,
maybe it's a curse.

149
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:58,642
"Certain spiritual traditions believe
that a great evil or great injustice

150
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:02,358
can be cursed into a time loop
until righted."

151
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:06,245
So that's probably why
this is happening to me.

152
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:08,240
Our job is to right the wrong.

153
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:11,641
Yeah, well, we better do it
before your symptoms get any worse.

154
00:09:13,569 --> 00:09:15,799
I'll get that.

155
00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:22,241
Hey, Prue, long time.
Is Phoebe home?

156
00:09:24,169 --> 00:09:26,319
- What the?!
- Cole!

157
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:28,485
- What...?
- Phoebe, hi.

158
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:32,404
- These are for you.
- What the hell are you doing here?

159
00:09:32,609 --> 00:09:34,247
Do you have
some kind of a death wish?

160
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,758
Well, I told Phoebe last week
I wasn't giving up on her,

161
00:09:36,969 --> 00:09:39,358
- and I meant it.
- You talked to Phoebe?

162
00:09:39,569 --> 00:09:40,797
He talked to you?

163
00:09:40,969 --> 00:09:44,006
You said that he was alive,
you never said that he was back.

164
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,518
It didn't matter,
because as I told him,

165
00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:49,044
I don't want anything
to do with him anymore.

166
00:09:49,249 --> 00:09:52,082
- Oh, well, in that case...
- Hey, hey, hey. I just set that table.

167
00:09:52,249 --> 00:09:54,479
We don't have time to buy a new one
before dinner.

168
00:09:54,689 --> 00:09:56,680
I'm not gonna use my powers
against you anyway.

169
00:09:56,849 --> 00:09:59,283
In fact, I'm never gonna
use them again.

170
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:02,399
Ever. Keeps me from being evil.

171
00:10:02,609 --> 00:10:04,679
No, you will always be evil.
You're a demon.

172
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:08,199
Half-demon.
My human half can suppress it if...

173
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:10,642
Phoebe, you're hurt.
What happened?

174
00:10:10,849 --> 00:10:12,726
You know what, Cole?
It's none of your business.

175
00:10:13,729 --> 00:10:16,687
So why don't you do yourself a favour
and just get...

176
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:24,728
Phoebe?

177
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:31,364
Phoebe, what happened?

178
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:35,439
I think I've been shot.

179
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:46,921
Thing is, they can orb
into their charges' lives

180
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:48,886
any time of the day or night...

181
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:51,085
Refill?

182
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:53,558
...without us mortals
even knowing about it.

183
00:10:53,729 --> 00:10:56,960
You can't trust the whitelighters, Leo.
They're sneaky little bastards.

184
00:10:57,129 --> 00:10:58,323
Really?

185
00:10:58,489 --> 00:11:00,798
Because Piper says that
they're really, really good guys.

186
00:11:00,969 --> 00:11:02,960
More of, like, guardian angels.

187
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,040
That's the party line, Leo,
but don't believe it.

188
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:07,484
You can't trust them.
They have this tendency

189
00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:09,202
to fall in love with their charges.

190
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,325
Before you know it,
they've stolen your wife.

191
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:14,521
The girls' mother, Patty,
she fell for her whitelighter.

192
00:11:14,729 --> 00:11:16,401
I thought that happened
after you separated.

193
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:19,928
He was putting the moves on her
long before we split up, believe me.

194
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:23,877
And we never had a chance
to get back together because of him.

195
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:26,005
And...

196
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:27,568
...you know, then she died.

197
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:33,122
Look, my point is, if you wanna...

198
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,208
What?

199
00:11:38,609 --> 00:11:40,167
I have to go. Now.

200
00:11:40,369 --> 00:11:42,121
- Go?
- Yeah.

201
00:11:42,289 --> 00:11:44,757
And I don't think you're gonna like
the way I have to go either.

202
00:11:56,169 --> 00:11:57,761
What the hell are you doing here?

203
00:11:57,929 --> 00:11:59,885
Forget about him, Leo.
Phoebe's been shot.

204
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:01,204
Shot? How did that happen?

205
00:12:01,369 --> 00:12:03,360
There's no time to explain.
Can you heal her?

206
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:09,404
- Where's Dad?
- Seething, probably.

207
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:15,201
What's the matter?
Why isn't it working?

208
00:12:15,689 --> 00:12:16,758
I don't know.

209
00:12:17,289 --> 00:12:19,086
You gotta tell me
exactly how this happened.

210
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:23,647
I don't... I don't really know.

211
00:12:23,849 --> 00:12:27,637
I had a premonition,

212
00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:32,405
and I felt Bo get shot,
and then I came out of it.

213
00:12:32,609 --> 00:12:35,123
- Leo, can you heal her?
- No.

214
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:37,598
Because Phoebe wasn't the one
that was shot, Bo was.

215
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:39,999
What are you talking about?
She's bleeding.

216
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:42,325
I know, but it's more like
a psychic echo.

217
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,599
Phoebe is linked to Bo somehow.
Whatever he feels,

218
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:46,248
whatever happens to him
happens to her.

219
00:12:46,729 --> 00:12:48,287
Which means Bo
must be magical too.

220
00:12:48,489 --> 00:12:50,719
They only way they can be linked
is through their magic.

221
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:55,359
- I agree.
- We have to find Bo. Heal him.

222
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:56,564
It's the only way.

223
00:12:56,769 --> 00:12:58,282
Well, he's been cursed
into a time loop,

224
00:12:58,449 --> 00:12:59,928
along with the rest of the town.

225
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:03,240
And we don't know how to get there,
let alone where "there" is.

226
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,598
It's gotta be a parallel plane

227
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:06,646
existing on the same physical space
as the town.

228
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:09,687
You know, I don't think that we need
any demonic input right now.

229
00:13:11,689 --> 00:13:13,680
If I can help save Phoebe's life...

230
00:13:14,849 --> 00:13:16,202
...you sure as hell do.

231
00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:18,318
We're listening.

232
00:13:18,729 --> 00:13:20,162
I move through planes all the time,

233
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:22,047
it's how I've been hiding
from The Source.

234
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:24,565
Shouldn't be any problem
to shimmer into Bo's plane,

235
00:13:24,729 --> 00:13:26,606
bring him back here
so you can heal him.

236
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:28,886
You said you don't
use your powers anymore.

237
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:30,562
Shimmering isn't a lethal power.

238
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:36,605
Why don't you just take Leo with you,
and you can heal Bo there.

239
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,324
I can't. I'm not allowed to work
with a demon.

240
00:13:40,609 --> 00:13:42,167
- Fine, I'll go.
- Prue.

241
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:44,642
I'm not gonna leave this up to him.

242
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:46,481
Well, okay, what if
something goes wrong

243
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:49,607
and you get stuck in the time loop, and
you don't get back before midnight?

244
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:52,000
It's not the time loop
I'm worried about.

245
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:54,399
Look, why don't you and Leo
go to the town,

246
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:57,606
see if you can find anything there
to help break the curse.

247
00:13:58,009 --> 00:13:59,601
You, you hang in there, okay?

248
00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:03,168
Play nice, you two.

249
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:07,125
Gotta hold my hand.

250
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:09,359
This already sucks.

251
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:16,164
- Leo! You lying little piece of...!
- Okay. Dad, not now.

252
00:14:16,369 --> 00:14:18,644
Stay with Phoebe. We'll be back.

253
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:26,482
Well, don't get mad at me,
I've been shot.

254
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:33,926
- It worked.
- You doubted me?

255
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:35,807
Yeah, well, for all I knew,
you were gonna...

256
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,801
Okay.

257
00:14:41,569 --> 00:14:46,245
- Welcome to the Wild, Wild West.
- All right, just so we're clear,

258
00:14:46,409 --> 00:14:48,047
I'm in charge here.
You're just my ride.

259
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:51,758
- Fine with me. What's your plan?
- Find Bo, lay low.

260
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:54,727
- That's a plan?
- Yeah. You got a better one?

261
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:57,244
Maybe. But...

262
00:14:57,409 --> 00:15:01,527
...first I think we better find something
a little less conspicuous to wear.

263
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:04,886
Fine. Agreed. Any ideas?

264
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:09,327
Okay, watch out. Make room.
Let's put him up.

265
00:15:09,489 --> 00:15:12,367
Yeah. Nothing you're
gonna like, though.

266
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:14,679
- Thanks, Roy.
- Yeah.

267
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:18,045
I'll raise you a dollar.

268
00:15:19,969 --> 00:15:22,529
Still think you should have worn
that pretty little red dress

269
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:24,680
- drying on the line.
- It was a prostitute's dress.

270
00:15:24,849 --> 00:15:26,282
Not the impression
I wanted to make.

271
00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:28,405
At least I'm not wearing
some dead guy's clothes.

272
00:15:28,569 --> 00:15:31,447
I thought you'd be pleased. At least
I'm playing the role of a good guy.

273
00:15:31,609 --> 00:15:35,397
Yeah, right. All right, just fact-finding,
okay? No getting involved.

274
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:39,683
- What will it be?
- Hi. Moonshine.

275
00:15:39,849 --> 00:15:43,285
- A what?
- She means whiskey. Make it two.

276
00:15:43,489 --> 00:15:46,242
Leave the bottle.
You watch too many old movies.

277
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:48,764
And you'd be confusing me
with Phoebe.

278
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:50,601
Not a chance.

279
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:53,721
- Passing through?
- Maybe.

280
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:57,368
Maybe, if you're not,
you ought to consider it.

281
00:15:57,569 --> 00:15:59,480
Things are getting pretty dangerous
around here.

282
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:04,277
Friendly advice: Wet your whistle,
get back on your horses

283
00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:06,565
and move on as fast as you can.

284
00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:10,604
Hi. What am I, a potted plant?

285
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:12,521
Talk to me. What's so dangerous?

286
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:15,563
It's nothing to concern
your pretty little head about.

287
00:16:15,929 --> 00:16:17,282
Okay, now, that's condescending.

288
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:19,360
- Lay low, remember?
- Fine.

289
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:20,518
You were saying?

290
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:24,163
There's some trouble
between a powerful man in town...

291
00:16:24,369 --> 00:16:26,963
- Sutter?
- How do you know about Sutter?

292
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:28,921
This pretty little head knows a lot.

293
00:16:29,849 --> 00:16:31,680
So why don't you talk
to both of us now.

294
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:33,766
Tell us what's going on.

295
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:37,677
One of Sutter's men just got killed.

296
00:16:37,849 --> 00:16:39,965
And now there's gonna be
hell to pay.

297
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:27,167
Where is he?

298
00:17:28,729 --> 00:17:31,448
Just so you know,
I've already taken liberty

299
00:17:31,649 --> 00:17:34,083
to print up the evening edition.

300
00:17:34,249 --> 00:17:36,922
Just so you know
how serious this is.

301
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:40,718
All the news that's fit to print.

302
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:52,557
You know where your little brother's
hiding, now, don't you?

303
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:54,725
Even if I did, I'd never tell you.

304
00:17:57,129 --> 00:17:59,324
I'm not afraid of you, Mr. Sutter.

305
00:18:00,569 --> 00:18:02,446
Well, if you're smart, you'd be.

306
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:06,161
Of course, your kind are not,
aren't they?

307
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:10,362
Hold it. Plan is to not get involved.

308
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:16,878
I haven't seen Bo, Mr. Sutter.
I swear. Not since he took off.

309
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:27,603
You know, you lie to me again, Cal...

310
00:18:28,089 --> 00:18:30,205
...and I'll do worse than this.

311
00:18:37,329 --> 00:18:38,887
What the hell is wrong
with you people?

312
00:18:39,089 --> 00:18:42,479
Well, well, well.
What do we got here?

313
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:45,686
Prue?

314
00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:49,040
Lady, I don't know who you are
or where you come from,

315
00:18:49,569 --> 00:18:53,357
but you obviously don't have the
slightest idea who you're dealing with.

316
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:55,127
Oh, please, what a cliché.

317
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:01,601
I usually don't hit women.

318
00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:03,607
But seeing as you're dressed
like a man,

319
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:05,441
I imagine I can make an exception.

320
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:14,407
- Don't.
- No.

321
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:19,277
Deal with these two later.
After we take care of Bo.

322
00:19:25,089 --> 00:19:26,602
This ain't over.

323
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:30,398
You and me, we got a score to settle.

324
00:19:36,769 --> 00:19:39,442
One of you know where he's at.

325
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:45,561
And if you don't tell me...

326
00:19:45,729 --> 00:19:48,084
...I'm gonna burn this town
to the ground looking for him.

327
00:19:55,889 --> 00:19:59,086
- So much for laying low.
- Yeah.

328
00:20:04,249 --> 00:20:05,921
Sutter's in tight with the railroads.

329
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:08,683
He came here a couple months ago
promising to bring tracks through,

330
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:11,317
- make it more than an old mining town.
- In exchange for what?

331
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:14,367
Piece of everything,
mines, bank, the newspaper.

332
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:16,838
When folks started resisting,
his boys took over.

333
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:20,718
First, everybody stood up to them,
but after they killed the sheriff...

334
00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:23,119
- Cowards.
- Why is Sutter after your brother?

335
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:25,325
Because Bo wouldn't back down.
He kept on fighting,

336
00:20:25,489 --> 00:20:27,684
trying to get everybody
to take back the town.

337
00:20:27,849 --> 00:20:30,682
- Sounds like a brave man.
- He is. Too bad the others aren't.

338
00:20:30,849 --> 00:20:34,808
Isabel, we know that Bo was injured.
We know that he's been shot.

339
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:38,284
We can help you,
but you have to trust us.

340
00:20:38,969 --> 00:20:39,958
I do.

341
00:20:41,249 --> 00:20:42,443
Bo said you'd come.

342
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:48,487
How's that again?

343
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:50,560
Bo, he saw it in one of his dreams.

344
00:20:50,729 --> 00:20:54,404
He said that two strangers
would come, so...

345
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:55,558
...I knew.

346
00:20:55,729 --> 00:20:58,527
All right, so wait a second,
Bo has dreams about the future?

347
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:02,479
Yeah. He has the gift.
He inherited it from our father.

348
00:21:02,689 --> 00:21:04,919
He was a great medicine man.
His name was Soaring Crow.

349
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:07,279
- "Was"?
- He died when we were young.

350
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:09,606
When we moved here,
my mother wouldn't allow Bo

351
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:10,758
to talk about his gift.

352
00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:14,239
She knew that magic was considered
evil in the white man's world.

353
00:21:14,449 --> 00:21:17,361
Yeah, I know what it's like to have
a gift that you have to keep a secret.

354
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:20,566
And live in a place where you
have to hide half of who you are.

355
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:23,647
Come, I'll take you to Bo. Come.

356
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:28,200
- Where did you get the horses?
- Told you, I was expecting you.

357
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:39,882
You know, I still say we eliminate
the threat first, kill Sutter.

358
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,927
- Probably break the curse anyway.
- Yeah, well, we don't know that,

359
00:21:43,089 --> 00:21:44,920
which is why we
need to get to Bo first.

360
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:48,246
You know, Cole, if you wanna
try your hand at being good,

361
00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:50,400
your first instinct shouldn't be to kill.

362
00:22:09,889 --> 00:22:13,006
I don't know what we're
supposed to be looking for.

363
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:16,320
We gotta keep looking, find something
that might help us break the curse.

364
00:22:16,489 --> 00:22:20,004
Like what? There's nothing here
but spiders and lizards

365
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:21,522
and that stupid old crow.

366
00:22:21,729 --> 00:22:23,447
Oh, come on, let's keep looking.

367
00:22:23,649 --> 00:22:25,640
After all, we got a rehearsal dinner
to get back to.

368
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:27,800
There's not gonna be
a rehearsal dinner or a wedding

369
00:22:27,969 --> 00:22:29,880
if we don't find
a way to save Phoebe.

370
00:22:32,689 --> 00:22:33,724
What is it?

371
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:36,443
Phoebe said Bo got in a fight
in the bar, right?

372
00:22:36,609 --> 00:22:38,327
So that would be the saloon.

373
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:39,848
Makes sense, it's a Western.

374
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:42,925
So it's always the saloon.

375
00:22:58,449 --> 00:23:00,917
"Hankins Nerve Tonic.
Calms raw nerves."

376
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:02,647
Think I should bring a bottle back
for your Dad?

377
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:04,606
I don't think that will do it.

378
00:23:05,329 --> 00:23:08,765
There's nothing...
There's nothing here.

379
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,647
Great brainstorm, huh?

380
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:12,885
Actually, I think it was. Look.

381
00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:17,880
"Half-Breed to Die at Sundown"?

382
00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:21,325
Yeah. On that same day in 1873,
read who's gonna die.

383
00:23:21,489 --> 00:23:22,683
Bo Lightfeather.

384
00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:25,687
We gotta find a way
to warn Prue and Cole

385
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:27,282
that they don't have until midnight.

386
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,684
Which means neither does Phoebe.

387
00:23:38,769 --> 00:23:41,567
Here you go. Drink up.

388
00:23:47,569 --> 00:23:48,684
What is it?

389
00:23:50,209 --> 00:23:51,961
It's nothing.

390
00:23:52,129 --> 00:23:56,680
Hey, I didn't come back into your lives
just to be kept in the dark.

391
00:23:56,849 --> 00:23:59,124
I'm your Dad.
You can tell me anything.

392
00:24:06,089 --> 00:24:08,045
I'm dying.

393
00:24:08,249 --> 00:24:11,161
- Oh, come on.
- No.

394
00:24:12,849 --> 00:24:15,966
I can feel what's happening to me.

395
00:24:17,649 --> 00:24:19,446
It's like a...

396
00:24:19,609 --> 00:24:23,807
Something that you can feel...

397
00:24:25,009 --> 00:24:26,647
...deep inside of you.

398
00:24:32,089 --> 00:24:34,478
I can't explain it.

399
00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:37,887
Your sisters are not gonna
let that happen.

400
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:39,880
I am not gonna let that happen.

401
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:48,962
- How is she?
- She's gonna be fine.

402
00:24:49,929 --> 00:24:53,080
Okay, we have to hurry.
We found out Bo dies at sundown.

403
00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:54,722
Except I don't think Prue knows that.

404
00:24:54,889 --> 00:24:56,447
But we have an idea
how to let her know.

405
00:24:56,649 --> 00:24:58,241
Phoebe, if you're getting visions
from Bo,

406
00:24:58,409 --> 00:25:01,048
- maybe he can get one from you.
- I don't understand.

407
00:25:02,089 --> 00:25:05,001
Phoebe, if you can will yourself to get
a premonition about Bo's death,

408
00:25:05,209 --> 00:25:06,562
he might be able to see it too.

409
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:09,408
And then he can tell Prue and Cole
that they don't have as much time

410
00:25:09,569 --> 00:25:11,366
as they think they do.

411
00:25:11,529 --> 00:25:13,804
But I thought you said
you couldn't always get premonitions

412
00:25:13,969 --> 00:25:16,483
- when you wanted.
- I can't.

413
00:25:16,689 --> 00:25:18,759
You can try.

414
00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:36,079
Any idea what we should say
to him?

415
00:25:36,689 --> 00:25:39,078
"We" are not gonna say anything.
I'll do the talking.

416
00:25:39,569 --> 00:25:42,208
You know, it wouldn't kill you
to be nice to me.

417
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:45,124
Really? It's funny
that you should say that,

418
00:25:45,329 --> 00:25:48,082
considering how many times
you actually tried to kill me.

419
00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:49,608
That's all in the past, Prue.

420
00:25:50,529 --> 00:25:55,000
Right. After all this is done,
you need to leave us alone.

421
00:25:55,689 --> 00:25:58,442
Otherwise, we'll have to do what we
should've done in the first place,

422
00:25:58,609 --> 00:26:00,088
which is vanquish you.

423
00:26:00,249 --> 00:26:01,841
Then that's what you're
gonna have to do,

424
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:04,842
because it's the only way you're
gonna keep me away from Phoebe.

425
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:09,285
Are you guys ready to go in?

426
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:12,846
Something wrong?

427
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:16,126
No, nothing that I can't handle.

428
00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:28,367
He's very weak.

429
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:32,488
I tried to pull the bullet out,
but it's in too deep.

430
00:26:35,689 --> 00:26:37,407
Bo.

431
00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:41,401
Bo.

432
00:26:42,409 --> 00:26:43,603
How you doing?

433
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:49,088
What's the matter with you?
Who the hell are they?

434
00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:52,167
It's okay. They've come to help.

435
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:54,360
Just like in your vision, remember?

436
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:57,047
I don't know
what you're talking about.

437
00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:01,600
- Bo, I told them.
- Too much, apparently.

438
00:27:03,329 --> 00:27:06,241
We don't need your help.
Just leave now.

439
00:27:06,449 --> 00:27:08,280
Bo, my sister gets visions too.

440
00:27:08,489 --> 00:27:11,447
And she had one of you getting shot,
all right? We're here to help you.

441
00:27:11,649 --> 00:27:13,560
And help her.

442
00:27:14,329 --> 00:27:17,560
It's a trick. Sutter sent you.
I know he did.

443
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:20,886
No. They stood up to Sutter.
You should have seen it.

444
00:27:22,969 --> 00:27:24,038
Just get out of here.

445
00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:26,808
We're not going anywhere.

446
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:30,601
I know that look. Sutter's got it too.

447
00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:34,369
You're evil. I can sense it.

448
00:27:35,089 --> 00:27:37,922
All right, then just look at me.

449
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:41,765
You can't say the same thing
about me, can you?

450
00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:44,720
Bo, this isn't just about you, all right?

451
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:45,964
My sister will die too.

452
00:27:46,129 --> 00:27:48,165
This whole town will
if you don't let us help you.

453
00:27:49,249 --> 00:27:52,924
They think that something Sutter is
going to do to you will trigger a curse.

454
00:27:53,849 --> 00:27:55,999
The kind that Father
used to speak about.

455
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:03,361
If we show you
that we have gifts too,

456
00:28:03,529 --> 00:28:05,167
will you trust us then?

457
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:08,524
- Show him.
- Show him what?

458
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:11,118
Your gift. Show him your gift.

459
00:28:30,689 --> 00:28:33,078
This better be good.

460
00:28:33,249 --> 00:28:34,762
We couldn't find him, boss.

461
00:28:36,689 --> 00:28:40,648
Now, you listen to me,
and you listen real good.

462
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:44,559
Bo's giving the townsfolk ideas,
and I don't want them getting ideas.

463
00:28:45,329 --> 00:28:49,561
No one knows where he's at.
And if they do, they ain't talking.

464
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,646
Well, you make them talk!

465
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:55,959
This town is mine,
and it's gonna stay mine.

466
00:28:56,129 --> 00:29:00,247
When that railroad comes through...
Mark my words, it will.

467
00:29:00,969 --> 00:29:05,201
- when I'm selling this land,
that land is gonna be worth more

468
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:08,122
than any of you three are capable
of imagining.

469
00:29:13,129 --> 00:29:16,201
You better have something useful
to tell me, Cal.

470
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,408
I know where Bo is hiding.

471
00:29:19,809 --> 00:29:21,879
Finally...

472
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:24,483
...someone knows
what's good for him.

473
00:29:26,449 --> 00:29:27,802
All right.

474
00:29:27,969 --> 00:29:31,120
The first thing that we need to do
is get that bullet out of you.

475
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:36,765
This is gonna hurt.

476
00:29:51,929 --> 00:29:53,521
I'm warning you, half-breed.

477
00:29:57,409 --> 00:29:58,842
No!

478
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:12,680
I believe you.

479
00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:24,798
It's okay. You're okay.
Take a deep breath.

480
00:30:26,569 --> 00:30:28,639
I saw what they're gonna do to Bo.

481
00:30:29,969 --> 00:30:31,721
It was horrible.

482
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:35,400
- Do you think he saw it too?
- I know he did.

483
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:41,439
I felt it. And when he did anything,
they didn't help him.

484
00:30:41,649 --> 00:30:43,924
Nobody did anything.

485
00:30:44,129 --> 00:30:45,960
So, what do we do now?

486
00:30:46,209 --> 00:30:49,167
There's nothing else we can do
but wait. It's up to Prue and Cole.

487
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:51,206
And you call yourself
their guardian angel?

488
00:30:51,409 --> 00:30:53,843
What good is a whitelighter
if all you can do is stand there

489
00:30:54,049 --> 00:30:56,005
- and watch my daughter die?
- Dad, please don't.

490
00:30:56,209 --> 00:30:58,165
- You're not helping.
- And he is?

491
00:30:58,369 --> 00:31:00,405
Why don't you do something?
Isn't that your job?

492
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:04,124
You know, I am doing something. I am
trusting your other daughter, Prue.

493
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,365
You know, I know that you
feel helpless. We all do.

494
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:08,997
But Prue is not gonna let Phoebe die,
and neither is Cole.

495
00:31:10,209 --> 00:31:11,767
So now I'm supposed to trust
a demon?

496
00:31:11,969 --> 00:31:14,927
As much as I hate to say this,
Cole loves Phoebe.

497
00:31:15,929 --> 00:31:18,887
He took a huge risk to come here
and try and prove himself to her,

498
00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:21,478
and he will do whatever it takes
to save her life.

499
00:31:24,769 --> 00:31:27,203
- He's right.
- How can you be so sure?

500
00:31:28,169 --> 00:31:33,368
Because he loves me
as much as I love him.

501
00:31:53,169 --> 00:31:56,559
- You learn fast.
- Thanks. I have a few gifts too.

502
00:31:58,009 --> 00:32:00,239
Sutter's men just showed up.
We better get Bo out of here.

503
00:32:00,929 --> 00:32:03,762
- What? How did they find us?
- We must have been followed.

504
00:32:04,169 --> 00:32:06,808
I'll shimmer him back to Leo
then come back for you two.

505
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:08,561
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

506
00:32:08,729 --> 00:32:10,082
He dies, Phoebe dies.

507
00:32:10,409 --> 00:32:12,877
Taking Bo out of here
will not break the time loop.

508
00:32:13,249 --> 00:32:15,046
It will save Phoebe.

509
00:32:15,689 --> 00:32:18,647
Yeah, well, there's more than just
Phoebe's life on the line here, Cole.

510
00:32:20,249 --> 00:32:22,126
We have to break the curse
by sundown,

511
00:32:22,289 --> 00:32:24,564
otherwise this entire town is doomed
to repeat the same day

512
00:32:24,729 --> 00:32:26,287
over and over again.

513
00:32:27,009 --> 00:32:28,681
Are you seriously telling me
you're willing

514
00:32:28,849 --> 00:32:31,841
to sacrifice your sister's life
for a town full of cowards?

515
00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:34,802
What I'm saying to you is that
there's a greater good at stake here.

516
00:32:35,649 --> 00:32:37,241
One that I can't just walk away from,

517
00:32:37,409 --> 00:32:39,161
and one that you shouldn't
walk away from

518
00:32:39,329 --> 00:32:40,728
if you truly expect to be good.

519
00:32:43,649 --> 00:32:45,241
We know you're in there, Bo.

520
00:32:45,449 --> 00:32:47,599
Come on out with your hands up,
and nobody gets hurt.

521
00:32:48,809 --> 00:32:50,959
What's it gonna be, Bo?

522
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,205
All right,
how do we break the curse?

523
00:32:53,369 --> 00:32:56,088
I don't know, but I do know
that it hinges on keeping Bo alive.

524
00:32:56,289 --> 00:32:58,325
No, it doesn't.

525
00:32:58,849 --> 00:33:02,000
The curse isn't about me,
or about Sutter.

526
00:33:04,169 --> 00:33:08,048
It's about them. Townspeople
who stood there and watched me die.

527
00:33:08,249 --> 00:33:11,127
The only way is
for me to give myself up.

528
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:15,282
- No.
- It's okay, Isabel. Have faith.

529
00:33:17,169 --> 00:33:18,887
They'll kill you.

530
00:33:19,609 --> 00:33:21,201
Maybe.

531
00:33:21,409 --> 00:33:24,242
This curse came
from my father's people.

532
00:33:24,409 --> 00:33:25,888
I understand that now.

533
00:33:26,289 --> 00:33:27,563
It's meant to heal,

534
00:33:27,929 --> 00:33:31,046
to teach the townspeople
to act without shame.

535
00:33:31,249 --> 00:33:34,559
- I have to give them that chance.
- Helping them to save you...

536
00:33:34,729 --> 00:33:35,957
...saves themselves.

537
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:19,448
I want you all to see what happens
when people cross me.

538
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:27,884
No. No.

539
00:34:28,049 --> 00:34:30,609
Don't. He knows what he's doing.

540
00:34:51,769 --> 00:34:55,603
What's the matter, boy?
You too stupid to scream?

541
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:14,001
I want you to beg for mercy.

542
00:35:19,249 --> 00:35:20,921
What are you people doing?

543
00:35:21,529 --> 00:35:23,360
Look at him.

544
00:35:23,569 --> 00:35:26,208
He has the courage
to fight Sutter for all of you.

545
00:35:27,089 --> 00:35:29,683
You can't just stand there
and watch him die.

546
00:35:29,889 --> 00:35:33,279
You have to do something.
You can take him down.

547
00:35:33,489 --> 00:35:37,164
Sutter can't take all of you out.
You need to do what's right.

548
00:35:39,329 --> 00:35:41,445
You cannot just stand by
and let this happen.

549
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:43,760
Stand up to him. Don't be scared.

550
00:35:49,729 --> 00:35:51,242
No.

551
00:35:53,329 --> 00:35:56,048
Nobody crosses me.

552
00:36:08,929 --> 00:36:12,717
I think you just ought to
leave Bo alone, Sutter.

553
00:36:14,449 --> 00:36:16,485
You just signed
your own death certificate.

554
00:36:18,569 --> 00:36:21,641
You wanna kill Bo,
you're gonna have to kill me too.

555
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:24,563
We're with you, Cal.

556
00:36:24,769 --> 00:36:26,646
- You heard him, Sutter.
- Yeah, okay.

557
00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:28,123
We got you now.

558
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,600
- Are you okay?
- Let her go, Sutter.

559
00:36:30,769 --> 00:36:32,407
- Leave her alone.
- Anybody comes after me

560
00:36:32,569 --> 00:36:34,048
and she's dead.

561
00:36:34,249 --> 00:36:36,717
- Now can we do something?
- Oh, yeah.

562
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,361
Bo. Bo.

563
00:37:31,969 --> 00:37:34,927
I don't think Sutter's gonna be
a problem anymore.

564
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:37,284
What about the curse?

565
00:37:37,449 --> 00:37:39,087
It's a beautiful sunset, isn't it?

566
00:37:39,249 --> 00:37:43,162
I don't think there's been one
quite like it in 128 years.

567
00:37:47,489 --> 00:37:49,241
Looks like you're out of bullets.

568
00:37:53,169 --> 00:37:55,364
I'm gonna enjoy this.

569
00:37:55,529 --> 00:37:58,999
- See you in hell.
- Been there, done that.

570
00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:14,885
Like I said, once a demon,
always a demon.

571
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:25,843
So where are they?

572
00:38:26,009 --> 00:38:27,761
I don't know,
unless they didn't make it out.

573
00:38:27,929 --> 00:38:30,238
Don't even say it.
Don't even think it.

574
00:38:33,729 --> 00:38:35,526
- Finally.
- What took you so long?

575
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:36,883
We've been worried sick.

576
00:38:37,089 --> 00:38:39,364
Sorry, we had a few loose ends
to tie up.

577
00:38:40,169 --> 00:38:42,319
- Are you okay?
- I'm great.

578
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:45,043
Thank you. Both of you.

579
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:50,207
- And the time loop?
- Broken.

580
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,485
They will never have to live
that horror again.

581
00:38:53,009 --> 00:38:55,204
So then, where are they?

582
00:38:55,889 --> 00:38:57,641
I don't know,
probably living out their lives

583
00:38:57,809 --> 00:38:59,606
on a parallel plane, I guess.

584
00:38:59,769 --> 00:39:02,920
You don't think about it too much,
Victor. It'll just give you a headache.

585
00:39:03,129 --> 00:39:06,041
Okay, anybody up
for a rehearsal dinner?

586
00:39:06,249 --> 00:39:08,809
Absolutely. I'm starving.

587
00:39:12,369 --> 00:39:14,485
Well, I guess I should be going.

588
00:39:15,169 --> 00:39:17,205
Yeah, that would probably be
a good idea.

589
00:39:23,969 --> 00:39:25,561
You're not going anywhere.

590
00:39:28,769 --> 00:39:31,488
Phoebe, I don't wanna
cause any trouble.

591
00:39:42,169 --> 00:39:44,046
You're staying.

592
00:39:44,209 --> 00:39:46,086
And that's that.

593
00:39:47,289 --> 00:39:50,167
All right, then, shall we?

594
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:53,197
Yeah.
