0
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:10,567
See, we finally found a place
where we can be alone.

1
00:00:10,729 --> 00:00:13,926
Yeah, this is perfect. Now all we
have to do is move all our stuff in here,

2
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:16,808
- and nobody will be able to bother us.
- Yeah.

3
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:21,159
I'm not looking at anything,
and I do not see anything.

4
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:24,765
No one's looking. No one's looking at
anything. I just need to get my gloss.

5
00:00:24,969 --> 00:00:26,607
- Phoebe.
- I'm sorry.

6
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:28,919
Were you guys
in the middle of the...?

7
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:33,168
No, not yet. Phoebe,
would you just get out of here?

8
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:36,884
I found it. Okay, I'm going now.
Out of here, found the gloss.

9
00:00:37,089 --> 00:00:39,444
Watch out for the...

10
00:00:40,529 --> 00:00:41,757
I'm okay.

11
00:00:45,529 --> 00:00:47,997
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey, Prue. Are you lost?

12
00:00:49,169 --> 00:00:51,000
No, but my keys are.
Have you seen them?

13
00:00:51,169 --> 00:00:53,319
No, have you seen the way out?

14
00:00:54,209 --> 00:00:56,598
- I knocked, didn't I?
- But you didn't wait for an answer.

15
00:00:57,569 --> 00:01:00,561
Oh, right. God, I'm really sorry.

16
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:02,640
Look at me. Look at me leaving.
I'm leaving.

17
00:01:02,849 --> 00:01:04,567
Yes.

18
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:07,448
Well, we knew
what we were getting into.

19
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,965
So maybe it's time we get out of it.

20
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:12,881
What do you mean?

21
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:14,448
Okay.

22
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:17,567
Once upon a time,
before we were witchy women,

23
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:20,886
Prue and I shared this amazing
apartment in North Beach.

24
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:22,323
But then when Grams got sick,

25
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:24,400
we decided to move back
to the manor for a while.

26
00:01:24,609 --> 00:01:26,167
And we gave up the apartment
to friends,

27
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:29,361
and your wife was smart enough
to keep in touch with them.

28
00:01:29,529 --> 00:01:30,882
Should I be taking notes?

29
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:33,160
They're moving out.
They're moving out,

30
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,968
and they will give us first shot
at taking over the lease.

31
00:01:36,169 --> 00:01:38,205
Well, are you sure we can?

32
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:40,878
Well, the rent's a little steep, but...

33
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:43,483
No, no, no. I mean, the bigger
"are you sure we can?"

34
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:46,409
You guys didn't get your powers
until you moved back in together.

35
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:49,681
There might be some supernatural
ramifications to living apart.

36
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:53,518
Okay, but what about the marital
ramifications to living together?

37
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:57,358
I mean, Leo, everything we do
is about navigating our charmed lives.

38
00:01:57,529 --> 00:02:00,521
I mean, when do we get to concentrate
on our married life?

39
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:03,641
Maybe this apartment
falling into our laps is a sign.

40
00:02:03,849 --> 00:02:07,808
A sign that it's time to move
out of the manor and in together.

41
00:02:12,089 --> 00:02:14,000
What do you think the odds are
of pulling this off

42
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:15,761
before the next demon attacks?

43
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,482
Shadow.

44
00:02:50,649 --> 00:02:52,685
You gave me a fright, little one.

45
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:55,841
You know better than
to interrupt me during ritual.

46
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:00,048
Now, go. Go. Go.

47
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:16,801
What on earth are you doing?

48
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:21,844
Shadow.

49
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:25,078
Don't do this. Please.

50
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:27,366
No!

51
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:55,280
What's the matter,
cat got your tongue?

52
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:55,442
Flakes.

53
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:58,761
- The Warriors.
- Pathetic defence.

54
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:01,799
- Somebody pass the...
- Yep. I got it.

55
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:04,842
- Hey, what time does the BART...?
- Every 15 minutes on a Saturday.

56
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:07,523
Oh, good. Mama needs
a new pair of shoes.

57
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:12,048
I know, limited funds. I will limit
my shopping to just window, I promise.

58
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,721
I will gladly trade somebody
for the opinion page.

59
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:17,368
Leo and I are moving.

60
00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:24,086
Thinking of moving out of the manor.

61
00:05:25,609 --> 00:05:27,565
Milk?

62
00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:30,243
- Excuse me?
- Wait a minute. Life-altering plans

63
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:32,525
cannot be squeezed in
between "pass the newspaper"

64
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:35,044
- and "who ate the Special K?"
- Okay, look,

65
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:39,487
we all knew this would happen
sooner or later. It's just sooner.

66
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:42,362
Well, actually, it's later because
I've been married for weeks,

67
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:46,244
and we're living in a bedroom with the
wallpaper I picked out when I was 9.

68
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:50,767
Not to mention the bathroom sharing
and the family breakfasts.

69
00:05:50,969 --> 00:05:53,688
And the whole saving the world
on a weekly basis thing.

70
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:56,687
I mean, Piper, we don't live here
just for sentimental value, all right.

71
00:05:56,849 --> 00:05:58,680
We live here because
we're the strongest here.

72
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:01,005
Right, I know.
Leo, a little assist?

73
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:05,082
Well, there have been times when
you've handled things on your own.

74
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:06,563
I mean, without Piper.

75
00:06:07,369 --> 00:06:08,882
Like when I went to Hawaii,

76
00:06:09,049 --> 00:06:11,961
or when I went away with Leo,
and everything was fine.

77
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,517
Do I get to kick her first?

78
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:15,680
Everything was not fine, Piper.

79
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:19,285
All right, the charmed gig is all about
being a trio, all right. Without you...

80
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:22,926
Well, you'd still have her.
We wouldn't be moving far.

81
00:06:23,369 --> 00:06:27,567
Just far enough so I could
have my own life, our own life.

82
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:32,327
We all knew this would happen.
I'm just the one that's saying it first.

83
00:06:32,489 --> 00:06:34,445
We can't live together forever.

84
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:37,643
Right, and we also cannot
ignore the responsibility

85
00:06:37,809 --> 00:06:39,925
that we inherited from our family.

86
00:06:42,609 --> 00:06:44,964
Well, you guys have to try
and understand.

87
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:47,006
I have two families now.

88
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:49,961
Besides, wasn't it you, Miss Phoebe,

89
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:52,359
who moved to New York
three years ago?

90
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:54,207
Oh, no, no. That doesn't count.

91
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:56,918
That was before
the whole destiny thing kicked in.

92
00:06:57,129 --> 00:06:59,359
We didn't get powers until
six months after Grams died.

93
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:01,241
Speaking of, what do you think
she would say

94
00:07:01,409 --> 00:07:03,718
if she knew you were even
considering this?

95
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:07,047
Morons.
Why does that prepubescent

96
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:09,484
have to throw the paper
in the shrubbery?

97
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:12,288
Roger seems to have forgotten
an entire forest of his family tree.

98
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:16,124
So now the head count for
the ceremony is up to 180. I know...

99
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:17,802
Grams.

100
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:22,963
The doctor was very clear
when he said no caffeine.

101
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:26,007
Here. Have some nice tea.

102
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:29,605
No, that would just be my sister yelling.
It'll be a lot easier when I move out.

103
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:32,159
Grams, where's the paper?

104
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:35,598
Can I call you back? Thank you.

105
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:39,648
You know, I'm so glad to have the two
of you in the same place. It's a rarity.

106
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:41,606
Oh, listen. Do me a favour.

107
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:45,444
I just treated myself and bought...
Ta-da.

108
00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:50,280
A great new camera even though it's
last year's model. What is it, a '96?

109
00:07:50,489 --> 00:07:52,923
Well, I'd just like to get
a picture of, you know...

110
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:54,488
Did you say you were moving out?

111
00:07:55,249 --> 00:07:57,763
Yes, I did. We can't all live here
with Grams forever.

112
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:02,245
Yeah, maybe just a couple
of quick shots, you know, candids.

113
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,087
When was this decided?

114
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:07,321
Oh, I don't know.
Probably when I was proposed to.

115
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,000
Maybe later.

116
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:14,637
- Grams.
- Please sit down.

117
00:08:14,809 --> 00:08:16,481
You only just got back
from the hospital.

118
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:19,288
Okay, I'll take it easy.

119
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:21,526
After I get that.

120
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:24,039
But...

121
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:34,326
Oh, you guys all didn't have to get
out of bed for little old me.

122
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:37,089
- Mrs. Halliwell?
- Can I hear what she did first

123
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:39,809
- before I answer that?
- She was caught shoplifting.

124
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:43,928
Oh, that is so not true. I just
forgot to pay for them, Grams.

125
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,000
The store's not even pressing charges.

126
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,681
- Phoebe.
- Please don't sound so disappointed.

127
00:08:50,609 --> 00:08:54,488
Look, you're always talking about how
we should spend more time together,

128
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:57,603
and, well, here we all are.

129
00:08:59,729 --> 00:09:01,367
Okay, that was really fun.

130
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:06,320
Phoebe,
what is the matter with you?

131
00:09:06,689 --> 00:09:08,725
How can you behave so recklessly?

132
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:10,762
What about your destiny?

133
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:13,967
Your... Your future.

134
00:09:15,369 --> 00:09:16,597
Well, maybe my future plans

135
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:19,203
don't match up to the ones
that you've mapped out.

136
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:23,439
We're gonna need to take back
those shoes that you...

137
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:25,208
Forgot to pay for?

138
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:27,365
Right.

139
00:09:30,849 --> 00:09:33,886
They're just out of my price range.

140
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:37,878
- But they're...
- Perfect. I know.

141
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:40,326
And I'm sure all these
will be perfect too.

142
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:50,444
Okay, I'm weak.
Can you show me this one too?

143
00:09:54,729 --> 00:09:57,641
- Or not.
- Those are so last season.

144
00:10:07,449 --> 00:10:09,405
Whoa. Down, boy.

145
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:14,279
Whoa, who did you steal
that power from?

146
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,241
That's for me to know
and you to find...

147
00:10:20,689 --> 00:10:22,600
I hear spikes are making
a comeback.

148
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:32,367
I think we got too many boxes.

149
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:33,962
No, we didn't.

150
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:36,006
You only live on this plane part-time,

151
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:39,161
and there is no way we need
all these boxes just for me.

152
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:40,762
Yes, we do.

153
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:42,885
Are you saying
I have too much stuff?

154
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:44,448
Yes, I am.

155
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:47,169
You do realize the only reason
I'm letting you get away with that

156
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:49,320
is because you're the only one
on my team right now.

157
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:52,407
Yes, I do. They just need some time
to get used to the idea.

158
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,287
Well, moving out
is a big deal for me too.

159
00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:56,679
I could use some support right now.

160
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:06,082
Leo, help.

161
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:10,117
Piper.

162
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:11,808
What am I supposed
to do with this?

163
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:14,285
No, no. Way too messy. Too violent.

164
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:20,966
You okay?

165
00:11:21,169 --> 00:11:23,319
I'm fine. Whatever.

166
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:26,640
Okay, girls. Now, if you could
just move a little closer, okay?

167
00:11:27,609 --> 00:11:30,760
Phoebe, turn to me. I want to
be able to get your good side.

168
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:32,801
I don't think she has one
today, Grams.

169
00:11:32,969 --> 00:11:35,244
Can we please get this over with?

170
00:11:35,409 --> 00:11:38,958
- Why, you got plans?
- Prue, all I'm getting is shoulder.

171
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:41,687
With anyone that I know?

172
00:11:41,849 --> 00:11:44,647
I'm sure lying beneath
all this sarcasm, there is a point.

173
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:47,323
And if it has anything
to do with Roger...

174
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:49,406
Well, he said that you
called him yesterday.

175
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,679
Looking for you.
Prue, I'm not gonna defend myself

176
00:11:51,849 --> 00:11:53,840
- when I didn't do anything wrong.
- Really?

177
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:55,118
Trying to be nice to him,

178
00:11:55,289 --> 00:11:57,723
considering he's gonna be
part of this family soon.

179
00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:00,887
You know, which I'm not even sure
I wanna be part of this family.

180
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:04,718
The sun is shifting. Could you
move down a step, please?

181
00:12:05,449 --> 00:12:08,361
And why would I waste my time
on a wimp who's got mother issues?

182
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:11,962
I don't know, but why should
I believe anything you say?

183
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:14,603
You don't know the difference
between what belongs to you

184
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:16,407
and what belongs to,
oh, let's say, Macy's.

185
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,719
Alrighty then. Are we done?

186
00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:21,048
- Grams.
- Grams.

187
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:23,643
Okay, okay. Take shallow breaths.

188
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:27,002
Should I call the doctor?

189
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:28,881
No doctor.

190
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:31,203
Just a picture.

191
00:12:31,409 --> 00:12:33,923
Is it too much for an old lady
to ask her granddaughters

192
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:37,007
to retract their claws, stand still

193
00:12:37,169 --> 00:12:42,118
and look at me long enough
to take one lousy picture?

194
00:13:02,609 --> 00:13:05,248
Hi. What happened
to the "window" in your shopping?

195
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,683
Turns out these are a write-off.

196
00:13:06,849 --> 00:13:09,238
Who knew Prada's spring line
could be used to fight evil?

197
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:10,603
- I killed a...
- Warlock.

198
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:12,128
Appeared out of nowhere,
had to kill him.

199
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:14,206
- Wait, you too?
- Me three.

200
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:16,161
Warlock attacked me in the attic.

201
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,559
- Did we miss a convention?
- Well, if so, I got the runt.

202
00:13:18,729 --> 00:13:21,766
Bad teeth, funky clothes
and way too easy to kill.

203
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:24,568
- Black hair?
- Bad breath?

204
00:13:24,729 --> 00:13:26,845
- You know him?
- I think I killed him.

205
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:29,248
Care to try again?

206
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:48,369
- Okay, so that does it.
- Again.

207
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:51,680
Okay, does anyone else think that
was weird, like he wasn't even trying?

208
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:54,119
Almost as if he wasn't
even interested.

209
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:57,565
- What do you think he was up to?
- Or is up to.

210
00:13:57,729 --> 00:14:00,687
- How do we know he's really gone?
- We don't.

211
00:14:00,849 --> 00:14:02,805
But we all have vanquished
him once today.

212
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:05,689
- And?
- Well, what if he can't be vanquished?

213
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:16,037
I've been working on a vanquish
All the live long...

214
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:17,642
Whoa.

215
00:14:17,849 --> 00:14:20,204
- Okay.
- Thanks, Grams.

216
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,840
It's so weird that we listen to her
more now than when she was alive.

217
00:14:24,049 --> 00:14:26,927
How to perform a séance,
a ceremony to contact the dead.

218
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:30,246
But the guy we're dealing with
won't die, so that's not gonna help.

219
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:33,407
Yeah, I don't know. Grams
must be very, very, very confused.

220
00:14:34,609 --> 00:14:37,521
Very testy also.

221
00:14:37,729 --> 00:14:40,766
Okay, we're gonna need six candles,
white and purple,

222
00:14:40,969 --> 00:14:43,199
some burning cinnamon,
frankincense and sandalwood.

223
00:14:43,369 --> 00:14:45,007
Piper, you wanna grab
the white cloth?

224
00:14:47,609 --> 00:14:50,601
You know, this trunk would go great
at the foot of our bed.

225
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:52,999
Yeah, and my foot would
look great on your butt.

226
00:14:53,169 --> 00:14:57,799
You are so not taking that, okay?
It holds all of our ritual stuff.

227
00:14:58,249 --> 00:15:01,719
I just want things to remember
this place by.

228
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:03,203
How about this?

229
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:06,008
Something to bring a piece
of Grams to my place.

230
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:09,718
Okay, sweetie. Hey, can we try
and contact the dead now, please?

231
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:14,401
Beloved unknown spirit
We seek your guidance

232
00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:17,925
We ask you to commune with us
And move among us

233
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:21,445
Beloved unknown spirit
We seek your guidance

234
00:15:21,609 --> 00:15:24,487
We ask that you commune with us...

235
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:28,558
- Forgive me, but why...?
- We don't know.

236
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,920
But we were told
in a roundabout sort of way

237
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:32,841
that you might be able to help us.

238
00:15:33,409 --> 00:15:35,479
Are you witches?

239
00:15:36,249 --> 00:15:39,764
You're the three sister witches,
the Charmed Ones, aren't you?

240
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:43,361
- And you're a witch too?
- l...

241
00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:45,201
I was.

242
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:49,288
I'm sorry. This is so new.

243
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,088
I haven't exactly figured it all out yet.

244
00:15:53,249 --> 00:15:55,843
We think that we're up against
some evil that can't be killed.

245
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:57,761
We've nixed him four times, but...

246
00:15:57,929 --> 00:16:00,238
And since you're the only one
that answered our call...

247
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:03,043
The spirits must think I know
who you're up against.

248
00:16:03,249 --> 00:16:04,841
Right.

249
00:16:05,369 --> 00:16:07,599
You say you've killed him
four times?

250
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:11,199
Yeah, and it's like he just keeps on
coming back for more. It's like he...

251
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:12,683
Wants to die.

252
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:15,520
Do you know who he is?

253
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,886
He was my familiar,

254
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:21,040
a feline I called Shadow.

255
00:16:21,489 --> 00:16:25,721
He's a warlock now, what a familiar
becomes when he betrays his witch.

256
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:29,321
That must be why we can't kill him,
the whole nine lives thing.

257
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:33,442
So if we kill him five more times
he should be gonzo, right?

258
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:35,401
No, that's exactly what you can't do.

259
00:16:36,049 --> 00:16:38,563
You see, once a familiar
becomes a warlock,

260
00:16:38,729 --> 00:16:42,199
it has until the next new moon
to purge itself of its old life.

261
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:45,406
If it succeeds, it becomes immortal.

262
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:49,448
If it fails, it returns to its
animal state for eternity.

263
00:16:49,969 --> 00:16:54,759
Shadow was a cat. So it has to
shed all nine of its familiar lives.

264
00:16:54,929 --> 00:16:58,604
So why bother us? Why not
jump in front of nine buses?

265
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:01,044
Because we're the only ones
strong enough to kill him.

266
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:02,437
And he knew where to find us.

267
00:17:02,609 --> 00:17:05,885
What are we, like, in the Warlock's
Guide to San Francisco?

268
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:08,000
Okay, so this should be
a piece of cake.

269
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:11,406
All we have to do is make sure we
don't kill this guy five more times

270
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:15,005
- before the next new moon.
- That's two days. No problem.

271
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:17,803
I'm sorry, this just seems so callous.

272
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:21,001
I mean, you just lost your life,
and we're treating you like 411.

273
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:24,442
It's okay. I just...

274
00:17:24,889 --> 00:17:27,164
I am at peace now.

275
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:29,399
But the ones I loved...

276
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:33,562
When someone is taken
from you suddenly,

277
00:17:33,729 --> 00:17:35,401
there are no goodbyes.

278
00:17:36,209 --> 00:17:38,086
Something we're
all too familiar with.

279
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:43,286
At its core, evil exists for one reason,

280
00:17:43,449 --> 00:17:45,565
to spread loss.

281
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:47,966
Be careful not to lose each other.

282
00:17:51,209 --> 00:17:55,282
Take care, and blessed be.

283
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:11,567
Damn wind keeps
blowing out my candles.

284
00:18:11,729 --> 00:18:14,721
I'm sorry, Patty, I got cut off.

285
00:18:14,889 --> 00:18:16,402
Oh, now...

286
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,965
It's just what troubles me
about your daughters

287
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:25,285
is not where they came from,
it's where they're going.

288
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,162
It's just a phase.

289
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:30,762
When their destiny is revealed,
they'll come together.

290
00:18:30,969 --> 00:18:33,608
But what if they don't?
What if they never do?

291
00:18:33,969 --> 00:18:37,598
And what if the gift is too much
for them to handle, and they?

292
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:43,002
Well, regardless,

293
00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:45,361
I fear there may be only one option

294
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:48,362
if I can't find a way
to bring these girls together.

295
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:49,888
Mother, that's nonsense.

296
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:52,601
Perhaps.

297
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:55,002
Good night, my darling.

298
00:18:58,969 --> 00:19:00,925
Hey, who turned out the lights?

299
00:19:24,249 --> 00:19:25,477
What happened?

300
00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:27,887
I think I killed the warlock again.

301
00:19:28,089 --> 00:19:29,966
- Oh, Phoebe.
- Phoebe.

302
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,444
Well, I didn't mean to.
It was a gut reaction.

303
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:35,169
You know, self-preservation
and stuff.

304
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,125
You know, I've been thinking.

305
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:41,803
I'm pretty sure he won't
actually hurt us.

306
00:19:41,969 --> 00:19:46,167
I mean, he needs us. So let's just say
that he knocks one of us off.

307
00:19:46,329 --> 00:19:47,682
The power of three would be broken,

308
00:19:47,849 --> 00:19:49,601
and we wouldn't have
the strength to kill him.

309
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:51,561
And then he takes
a permanent catnap.

310
00:19:51,729 --> 00:19:53,879
But we're assuming that he's
smart enough to know this.

311
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:56,324
I mean, what if he isn't?
You know, what if he doesn't know

312
00:19:56,489 --> 00:19:59,049
that he shouldn't kill us, and we
sit there and watch it happen?

313
00:19:59,249 --> 00:20:00,841
Yeah, but what other choice
do we have?

314
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:03,364
I mean, we kill him
four more times, he wins,

315
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:06,760
becomes more powerful than we
can handle. Either way, we lose.

316
00:20:06,969 --> 00:20:09,244
I vote for not losing at all.

317
00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:14,766
Wow.

318
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:17,489
Yeah, sorry. I'll get all this stuff
out of the way soon as...

319
00:20:17,689 --> 00:20:19,839
You're gonna really do this, huh?

320
00:20:20,009 --> 00:20:21,601
Yeah.

321
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:25,206
You know, we have lived apart
before.

322
00:20:25,369 --> 00:20:28,327
Our lives were apart.
Piper, it's different now.

323
00:20:28,889 --> 00:20:30,686
I just think that we need
to talk this through.

324
00:20:30,889 --> 00:20:34,359
That way we all know exactly what
the consequences are for all of us.

325
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:38,445
Saved by the meow.
You know, I don't think

326
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:41,601
I'm ever gonna be able to look
at Kit quite in the same way

327
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:44,044
or get undressed in front of him
for that matter.

328
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:48,960
You guys are right.
We should talk this through.

329
00:20:57,449 --> 00:21:00,964
Oh, why does this stupid cat
keep hanging around?

330
00:21:01,129 --> 00:21:02,960
Who do you belong to?

331
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:05,245
Go home.

332
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:12,204
- What did you wanna talk about?
- Oh, let's just go for a walk.

333
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:14,246
Hi, kitty.

334
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:16,559
So there's just a little detail
about the wedding

335
00:21:16,769 --> 00:21:21,445
that hasn't been worked out yet.
Just listen to me, okay?

336
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:23,486
I want you to be my maid of honour.

337
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,082
Me?

338
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:27,558
I mean, it's not like I would
actually ask Phoebe.

339
00:21:28,249 --> 00:21:31,764
So I win by default? Wow, Prue,
you really know how to flatter a girl.

340
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:34,489
Piper, can you just give me
the tiniest of breaks here, okay?

341
00:21:34,649 --> 00:21:38,198
This is not how I ever thought that
this whole thing would happen, okay?

342
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:41,759
My God, I would love for both
of my sisters to be my best friend,

343
00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:46,366
but clearly that is not the case. I mean,
maybe one day things will change but...

344
00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:50,408
It's gonna take more than time.
I mean, I'm happy for you. I am.

345
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:53,641
And I know you have all these big
plans, but what about the rest of us?

346
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:55,447
I mean, you move in with Roger,

347
00:21:55,609 --> 00:21:58,487
and then I'm stuck here alone
taking care of Grams,

348
00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:00,526
and Phoebe's out of control.
What if...?

349
00:22:00,689 --> 00:22:03,123
What if there's an emergency?
What if something happens?

350
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:04,483
Okay, I won't be far away.

351
00:22:04,649 --> 00:22:06,640
It's not like you won't
be able to get a hold of me.

352
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:08,322
I just think we should
talk this through

353
00:22:08,489 --> 00:22:10,684
so we know what
the consequences are.

354
00:22:10,889 --> 00:22:13,357
Okay, look, maybe
a part of me is jealous

355
00:22:13,529 --> 00:22:15,201
because, you know,
you've got this great guy

356
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:17,564
and you're gonna have
this beautiful wedding.

357
00:22:17,729 --> 00:22:19,208
And I'm just not very good
with guys.

358
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:21,325
Sometimes I think
I'll never find true love.

359
00:22:21,489 --> 00:22:23,559
- Piper, that...
- But... Oh, sorry.

360
00:22:23,729 --> 00:22:25,959
No, it's my fault. Sorry.

361
00:22:36,209 --> 00:22:39,087
You know, just because I'm moving
out doesn't mean we still can't do this.

362
00:22:39,249 --> 00:22:41,763
What, mainline caffeine while
waxing on warlock issues?

363
00:22:41,969 --> 00:22:43,960
No, hang out.

364
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:46,404
You know, I don't wanna be
one of those old married lepers

365
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:48,207
that nobody thinks is fun anymore.

366
00:22:48,729 --> 00:22:51,880
- You've never been fun, Piper.
- I've always been fun, Prue.

367
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:54,768
- I am just Mrs. Fun now.
- Oh, Mrs. Fun.

368
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:57,643
You know, the life changes
from the move will work itself out.

369
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:00,369
It's the supernatural ones
that we're concerned about.

370
00:23:00,569 --> 00:23:03,163
But we get attacked
separately all the time,

371
00:23:03,329 --> 00:23:06,287
like yesterday, and we just came
together and sorted it out then.

372
00:23:06,609 --> 00:23:10,682
You know, you girls are getting
harder and harder to find.

373
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:13,158
I was beginning to think
you were trying to avoid me.

374
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:16,998
Wow, you've been thinking.
That's a pretty big step for a warlock.

375
00:23:18,089 --> 00:23:21,923
God, I am so sorry. That was awfully
catty of me, wasn't it?

376
00:23:22,089 --> 00:23:23,966
Is this the part where I'm
supposed to go:

377
00:23:24,129 --> 00:23:26,324
"Oh, they did research,"
and run away?

378
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:29,168
- Might be a good idea.
- Or what,

379
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:31,479
- you'll kill me?
- No.

380
00:23:31,689 --> 00:23:34,283
Actually, we'll do worse.
We won't touch you.

381
00:23:34,489 --> 00:23:38,402
Look at that. The witches think
they have this one figured out.

382
00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:41,442
Well, let me tell you all something.

383
00:23:41,649 --> 00:23:43,640
Don't dance
if you don't know the steps.

384
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,846
Oh, my God.

385
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:53,405
Call 911.

386
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:05,558
That girl. There's just no reason.

387
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:09,206
I got used to there being a reason,
you know, an explanation,

388
00:24:09,369 --> 00:24:11,883
- but she didn't even...
- Stand a chance.

389
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:14,967
But there was a reason, Pheebs.
He was sending a message.

390
00:24:15,129 --> 00:24:17,438
Yeah, and we got it loud and clear.

391
00:24:17,609 --> 00:24:20,646
But there's nothing we can do
that we haven't already done.

392
00:24:20,849 --> 00:24:23,727
So, what, he just keeps killing
until we kill him?

393
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:26,523
Which is exactly what he wants.

394
00:24:26,689 --> 00:24:28,805
It's exactly what we can't do.

395
00:24:29,329 --> 00:24:31,399
Is that a potion?

396
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:33,639
I wouldn't know where to begin.

397
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:35,162
Just keeping my hands busy.

398
00:24:35,329 --> 00:24:37,445
It's something Grams taught me,
actually, to improvise.

399
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:42,125
But all I've come up with is mud.

400
00:24:42,529 --> 00:24:45,885
So how do we kill a warlock who
we know we shouldn't be killing?

401
00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:49,123
Well, we've only got three more
chances to figure that out.

402
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:59,038
I am going to finish the brownies,
and don't even try and stop me.

403
00:24:59,209 --> 00:25:02,963
Well, I'm afraid Prue has beaten
you to it, but I've got a backup.

404
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,364
What do you say we whip up
your favourite

405
00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:07,724
double chocolate decadence cake?

406
00:25:08,489 --> 00:25:11,925
Isn't "decadence" French
for "don't even think about it"?

407
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:16,521
- What are you making?
- Oh, just keeping my hands busy.

408
00:25:16,689 --> 00:25:18,680
Oh, Phoebe,

409
00:25:18,849 --> 00:25:20,965
Piper and I were just thinking
of whipping up something

410
00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:24,764
we'll regret tomorrow.
Care to join us?

411
00:25:27,649 --> 00:25:30,209
- Where are you headed?
- Out.

412
00:25:35,129 --> 00:25:38,280
On second thought,
do you need a hand?

413
00:25:39,649 --> 00:25:41,082
Yeah.

414
00:25:47,889 --> 00:25:50,767
- What?
- How do you know what to add?

415
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:53,479
Well, you needed to balance
the mustard seed,

416
00:25:53,689 --> 00:25:57,284
which can be kind of harsh, and the
sea salt brings out the flavour of the...

417
00:25:59,129 --> 00:26:01,927
- Grams.
- Piper,

418
00:26:02,089 --> 00:26:04,284
you were born for this, literally.

419
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:06,281
Why do you insist
on wasting your talents

420
00:26:06,449 --> 00:26:08,405
behind some counter at a bank?

421
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:12,363
Because my talents don't come
with health benefits, Grams.

422
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:16,403
Prue's getting married,
and Phoebe's, well, Phoebe.

423
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:18,480
You know, somebody
has to be practical.

424
00:26:18,689 --> 00:26:20,680
Not at the expense of her dreams.

425
00:26:21,209 --> 00:26:23,803
No, at the expense
of losing this house

426
00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:26,648
and not being able to pay
your hospital bills.

427
00:26:28,969 --> 00:26:31,164
I'm sorry if I'm disappointing you.

428
00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:36,517
You could never do that.

429
00:26:37,449 --> 00:26:40,441
I'm just doing what I have to.

430
00:26:40,609 --> 00:26:42,201
It's okay.

431
00:26:48,329 --> 00:26:50,047
So am I.

432
00:27:07,889 --> 00:27:10,039
My sweet girls.

433
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:12,879
You're just not ready.

434
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:17,925
I've got to stop you from becoming...

435
00:27:18,129 --> 00:27:20,597
The Charmed Ones.

436
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:24,043
What does a fellow have to do
to get killed around here?

437
00:27:24,249 --> 00:27:25,887
Not gonna happen.

438
00:27:27,249 --> 00:27:32,243
I could sever a head.
Only take a second.

439
00:27:32,449 --> 00:27:34,360
Don't even think about it.

440
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:37,879
Wait a minute. That's it. I'll just
keep freezing him until midnight.

441
00:27:38,049 --> 00:27:40,517
A new moon means
bye-bye bad guy, right?

442
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:49,159
Oh, I'm just going to keep
getting better and better at this.

443
00:27:50,609 --> 00:27:52,167
Oh, it was a thought.

444
00:27:52,329 --> 00:27:55,287
Come on, time's wasting.

445
00:27:57,289 --> 00:27:59,564
You know I'm just going
to keep on killing.

446
00:27:59,729 --> 00:28:02,118
And the next one won't go so fast.

447
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:03,961
The next one I'll savour.

448
00:28:04,729 --> 00:28:07,163
You telling me all you're gonna do
is stand back and watch?

449
00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:11,882
How many more people have to die
before you do what I ask?

450
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:14,679
None.

451
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:21,919
- I'm sorry. I...
- Had to.

452
00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:24,683
I would've done it first,
but you beat me to it.

453
00:28:24,849 --> 00:28:26,919
All right, well, he's only got
two more lives left.

454
00:28:27,089 --> 00:28:28,727
And we've only got one option.

455
00:28:28,889 --> 00:28:30,208
But we already looked in the Book.

456
00:28:30,369 --> 00:28:32,837
We look again.
No more pussyfooting around.

457
00:28:37,969 --> 00:28:39,960
Why now, Mother?

458
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:44,118
We both know why.
We're just not willing to say it.

459
00:28:44,329 --> 00:28:46,445
- Please don't.
- I'm not well, Patty.

460
00:28:46,649 --> 00:28:48,128
- When I die...
- Mother.

461
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:52,045
When I die, the girls
will receive their powers.

462
00:28:52,209 --> 00:28:54,165
I have to stop that from happening.

463
00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:56,963
But it's their destiny.
It's what they're meant to be.

464
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:59,558
Who are we to decide that
they're meant to be witches?

465
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:02,283
Who are we to decide
that they're not?

466
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,928
This isn't your choice to make.

467
00:29:04,129 --> 00:29:06,438
But the girls are mine to protect.

468
00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:11,484
- Mom, are you all right?
- I'm fine.

469
00:29:11,689 --> 00:29:13,008
Don't change the subject.

470
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:18,002
Patty, they're not ready.

471
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:22,998
Do you really want me to put them
directly in harm's way?

472
00:29:30,049 --> 00:29:31,846
Good night.

473
00:30:03,529 --> 00:30:05,759
It's now or never.

474
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:38,325
Grams. Grams.

475
00:30:38,489 --> 00:30:41,162
- Prue, Phoebe, somebody, help!
- Oh, my God.

476
00:30:41,329 --> 00:30:43,047
Grams.

477
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:44,883
Oh, God.

478
00:31:01,089 --> 00:31:02,363
Well, that's number eight.

479
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:06,727
- One life to live.
- I know life isn't fair, but this sucks.

480
00:31:06,889 --> 00:31:09,483
I know, he left a stain.
But I think with a little water and...

481
00:31:09,649 --> 00:31:12,402
No. Death isn't brief,
it's permanent,

482
00:31:12,569 --> 00:31:16,482
and this guy gets to cheat it
not once but nine times.

483
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:18,287
Yeah, cheaters
aren't supposed to prosper.

484
00:31:18,449 --> 00:31:21,885
You know, if he had any idea what
death was really like, the real thing,

485
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:23,277
not the abridged version,

486
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:25,599
he wouldn't be so hot
under the collar to do it again.

487
00:31:25,769 --> 00:31:28,442
What if we showed him?

488
00:31:28,609 --> 00:31:30,645
- What do you mean?
- Well, every time he dies,

489
00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:33,767
- he feels pain, right?
- Yeah, but only for a second.

490
00:31:33,969 --> 00:31:37,803
But what if somehow we could
catch him in that second,

491
00:31:38,209 --> 00:31:42,566
on the instant of death in that one
moment where he actually feels pain,

492
00:31:42,729 --> 00:31:44,401
and then magnify it nine times?

493
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:47,363
Then he would feel the pain
of nine deaths,

494
00:31:47,529 --> 00:31:50,248
and it actually might
be enough to kill him.

495
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:53,960
- I like it.
- Well, we only have got one shot.

496
00:31:54,129 --> 00:31:57,326
Any other ideas? Let's do it.

497
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:10,641
Hey.

498
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:13,328
Hey.

499
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,487
You okay?

500
00:32:16,649 --> 00:32:18,321
I'm...

501
00:32:22,969 --> 00:32:25,005
I'm not, really.

502
00:32:25,969 --> 00:32:28,927
I don't know how we're supposed
to deal with this, Prue.

503
00:32:29,529 --> 00:32:32,123
I mean, it's not just losing her.

504
00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:36,805
It's the funeral arrangements
and the doctors and the lawyers.

505
00:32:36,969 --> 00:32:38,960
And there's nobody left to help us.

506
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:45,440
For what it's worth,

507
00:32:47,489 --> 00:32:50,322
the service today, Piper,
was really beautiful.

508
00:32:54,089 --> 00:32:56,557
She would've liked what you said.

509
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:00,047
Thanks.

510
00:33:01,249 --> 00:33:04,685
I know that this is
gonna sound strange,

511
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:06,363
but do you think that she heard?

512
00:33:08,729 --> 00:33:10,845
I think she did.

513
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:16,997
Come on.

514
00:33:20,089 --> 00:33:22,842
I'd still like to know
what she was doing up there.

515
00:33:23,009 --> 00:33:24,408
Up where?

516
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:28,005
Piper thinks that Grams was up
in the attic before she died.

517
00:33:28,169 --> 00:33:29,522
That's not possible.

518
00:33:29,689 --> 00:33:32,044
She always told us
that the attic was sealed off.

519
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:35,882
Yeah, well, then what was she doing
coming down those stairs?

520
00:33:38,209 --> 00:33:41,326
I think the more important question is

521
00:33:42,489 --> 00:33:44,525
what are we doing?

522
00:33:46,209 --> 00:33:47,801
What do you mean?

523
00:33:48,009 --> 00:33:52,844
I mean, precisely what Grams was
always concerned about, our future.

524
00:33:53,569 --> 00:33:58,643
The only reason we're all still here,
still together is because of her.

525
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:03,481
And now, Prue, you've already got
one foot out the door,

526
00:34:03,689 --> 00:34:07,204
and, Piper, you don't wanna bunk
with me any longer than you have to.

527
00:34:07,369 --> 00:34:09,929
So let's just face it.

528
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:11,962
She was the glue.

529
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:15,567
Why don't we talk about this
over dinner.

530
00:34:15,729 --> 00:34:18,926
I'll make one of Grams'
favourite meals.

531
00:34:20,209 --> 00:34:22,564
She always liked the idea
of me being in the kitchen.

532
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:29,648
Actually, I'm sort of supposed
to spend the night with Roger.

533
00:34:31,329 --> 00:34:33,320
What about you, Pheebs,
table for two?

534
00:34:36,049 --> 00:34:40,600
Actually, I was thinking
about getting out of here.

535
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:42,768
Are you going out?

536
00:34:43,769 --> 00:34:45,361
No.

537
00:34:45,689 --> 00:34:47,486
Going away.

538
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:50,647
I...

539
00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:53,167
I'm not sure what my future holds,

540
00:34:53,329 --> 00:34:56,799
but I do know it's not
in San Francisco.

541
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:00,848
- Phoebe, you don't have to...
- It's okay.

542
00:35:01,169 --> 00:35:06,038
We all know that the only thing that I
contribute to this threesome is trouble,

543
00:35:07,449 --> 00:35:10,600
so I'm gonna go and see
what New York thinks of me.

544
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:14,121
Whatever my destiny may be,

545
00:35:14,289 --> 00:35:15,927
I might find it there.

546
00:35:16,889 --> 00:35:18,117
Phoebe, what about school?

547
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:20,678
Well, school will still be there
if I come back.

548
00:35:22,049 --> 00:35:25,246
Grams always said
that we all had a purpose.

549
00:35:28,529 --> 00:35:32,920
So maybe we'll have an easier time
finding it on our own.

550
00:35:44,129 --> 00:35:45,847
I guess I'm gonna...

551
00:35:46,009 --> 00:35:47,442
Yeah.

552
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,202
Okay.

553
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:05,564
- Spell?
- Check.

554
00:36:05,729 --> 00:36:06,764
- Potion?
- Check.

555
00:36:06,929 --> 00:36:08,965
- Sharp, painful implement?
- Check.

556
00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:11,000
- Oh, nice choice.
- Thank you.

557
00:36:11,209 --> 00:36:13,165
So, what is our level of confidence
in this plan?

558
00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:15,758
Well, on a scale of one to ten,
ten being we whoop ass,

559
00:36:15,929 --> 00:36:18,568
one being he laughs at us
while we're on fire and naked...

560
00:36:18,729 --> 00:36:20,401
Maybe you should lie to me.

561
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:24,881
Hello, ladies.

562
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:29,960
I love the smell of defeated witch
in the evening.

563
00:36:30,169 --> 00:36:32,285
Yeah, can we just get this
over with, please?

564
00:36:32,489 --> 00:36:35,606
Oh, it's fine when
you want to have coffee.

565
00:36:35,769 --> 00:36:37,600
But when I want to exchange
pleasantries,

566
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:39,919
you're in a hurry to kill me.

567
00:36:40,289 --> 00:36:42,325
- Where are your manners?
- We lost them

568
00:36:42,489 --> 00:36:43,808
when that girl lost her life.

569
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:45,722
And whose fault is that?

570
00:36:49,609 --> 00:36:52,282
Wait a minute.
Do you think I'm an idiot?

571
00:36:53,809 --> 00:36:55,322
You've got something up your sleeve.

572
00:36:56,409 --> 00:36:57,683
Hello, sleeveless.

573
00:36:58,929 --> 00:37:00,601
You know the moment
that I gain immortality

574
00:37:00,769 --> 00:37:04,045
I'm coming back here
to mangle your pretty little faces.

575
00:37:04,249 --> 00:37:06,285
Do you wanna die or not?

576
00:37:10,569 --> 00:37:13,242
- Do it.
- Alrighty then.

577
00:37:13,409 --> 00:37:15,081
Ready?

578
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:17,203
Now.

579
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:22,726
Nine times this evil's cheated death
Felt no pain and kept its breath

580
00:37:22,889 --> 00:37:26,598
This warlock standing in our midst
Let him feel what he has missed

581
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:38,517
No!

582
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:40,839
No!

583
00:37:47,129 --> 00:37:49,245
Okay, was that for good?

584
00:37:49,409 --> 00:37:51,798
Well, if it wasn't,
he's really gonna miss his ear

585
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:54,722
because it looks like part of it's
dripping off the clock.

586
00:37:56,049 --> 00:37:57,926
Ninth time is the charm.

587
00:37:58,089 --> 00:38:00,080
That was definitely different.
He's gone for good.

588
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:04,278
And yet somehow we're still here,
still together.

589
00:38:05,289 --> 00:38:06,881
Not for long.

590
00:38:09,689 --> 00:38:12,487
Is there anything special you
wanna do on your last night here?

591
00:38:13,689 --> 00:38:16,647
Well, I don't know.

592
00:38:17,049 --> 00:38:19,609
I guess, can I just have
a couple minutes alone?

593
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:25,326
Yeah, we'll be upstairs if you,
you know...

594
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:16,805
- Everything okay?
- Am I that obvious?

595
00:39:17,409 --> 00:39:21,004
No, I'm just incredibly perceptive.

596
00:39:21,169 --> 00:39:24,047
You wanna pull up a tailgate?

597
00:39:28,049 --> 00:39:31,200
Something just doesn't feel right.

598
00:39:31,889 --> 00:39:35,564
I mean, I know this step has
to happen, and I want it to happen.

599
00:39:35,729 --> 00:39:37,128
It's just that...

600
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:42,318
When Prue, Phoebe and I
moved back in together,

601
00:39:42,929 --> 00:39:45,568
it made us sisters again.

602
00:39:45,729 --> 00:39:48,482
And I don't think we're ready
to test that yet.

603
00:39:49,569 --> 00:39:52,037
And then there's this.

604
00:39:56,209 --> 00:40:00,122
I think we both know what those
ingredients would do to us.

605
00:40:01,849 --> 00:40:06,161
And the fact that Grams was willing
to keep us from being witches

606
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:08,445
to keep us together,

607
00:40:08,609 --> 00:40:12,204
well, that should mean
something, shouldn't it?

608
00:40:14,689 --> 00:40:16,645
You gonna hate me?

609
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:21,641
Not if we can hire movers
to move everything back in.

610
00:40:29,689 --> 00:40:32,726
Hey, can we talk to you
for a second? It's kind of important.

611
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:35,119
Sure. Everything okay?

612
00:40:35,289 --> 00:40:37,439
Yeah, it's just...

613
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:42,729
Well, we're more than excited that
you and Leo decided to move back in.

614
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:45,440
We sort of have to ask you
to move back out again.

615
00:40:47,089 --> 00:40:48,681
Of your room

616
00:40:48,889 --> 00:40:50,117
and into mine.

617
00:40:50,329 --> 00:40:54,242
I mean, it is twice as big, and
you now are twice the people.

618
00:40:54,449 --> 00:40:55,928
- Really?
- Really.

619
00:40:56,129 --> 00:40:59,246
That would be great.
That would be so amazing.

620
00:40:59,409 --> 00:41:01,639
- That would be so great. Thank you.
- Hey, you know what?

621
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:03,242
I deserve hugs too

622
00:41:03,409 --> 00:41:05,525
because I'm moving all of my stuff
out of your bathroom

623
00:41:05,689 --> 00:41:09,318
- so you and Leo could do, you know...
- That would be really great.

624
00:41:09,489 --> 00:41:12,686
- Yeah.
- It'll be just like having your own place.

625
00:41:12,849 --> 00:41:14,965
Yeah, only with your sisters
right down the hall.

626
00:41:15,129 --> 00:41:18,007
Yeah, I mean, I know that we
can't be together forever.

627
00:41:18,169 --> 00:41:21,639
But it feels good
that forever isn't today.
