0
00:00:03,529 --> 00:00:06,999
Oh, Billy,
please don't leave me alone!

1
00:00:08,969 --> 00:00:10,960
Guess who.

2
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:15,567
Is it really over?

3
00:00:15,729 --> 00:00:17,924
Yes, Sally May, it is.

4
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:19,841
Really and truly?

5
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:21,283
I'm here now.

6
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,328
And as long as I'm with you,
everything is gonna be A-okay.

7
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:28,044
- Promise?
- Promise.

8
00:00:28,209 --> 00:00:29,801
You're my hero, Billy!

9
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:32,961
And I think you're swell, Sally May.

10
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:56,806
- Cole?
- Phoebe, hi.

11
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,882
Just a little trick I learned
from the demon of illusion.

12
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:03,839
- But what...?
- Am I doing in here?

13
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:06,401
I wasn't sure how you'd react.

14
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:10,960
I thought this might be a safer way
of letting you know I was back...

15
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:12,926
...for good.

16
00:02:10,049 --> 00:02:12,438
So I had a really
good time tonight, Justin.

17
00:02:12,609 --> 00:02:15,601
Did you? I mean, really?

18
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:19,366
The reason I ask is,
you seemed kind of quiet.

19
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:23,845
No. It's just that, you know,
I've got a lot on my mind

20
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:25,601
with Piper getting married
and everything.

21
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:27,043
Sure.

22
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:30,407
Of course, if I was the paranoid type,
I'd think it was because of me.

23
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:32,207
Don't be ridiculous.

24
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:35,320
So are we still on
for lunch tomorrow?

25
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,445
Yeah, pick me up at 1?

26
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:39,686
- It's a date.
- Okay.

27
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:48,000
- Good night.
- Night.

28
00:03:03,089 --> 00:03:04,602
Hey.

29
00:03:05,529 --> 00:03:08,601
Gee, Prue, it's only 9:00
and your date's already over?

30
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:10,725
How very Disney of you.

31
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:12,567
Justin has a meeting
early in the morning.

32
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:14,048
I see. So did you decide

33
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:16,040
if you're going to invite
him to the wedding?

34
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:17,608
No, I'm stalling.

35
00:03:18,249 --> 00:03:20,399
I mean, you know, he's a nice guy.

36
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:23,163
He's sweet, but he's just so
predictable, you know.

37
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:26,287
There's no mystery,
no savoir-faire.

38
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:28,681
You know, besides...

39
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:32,048
...a wedding invite definitely
makes a statement.

40
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:35,440
- That he can tie a bowtie?
- No, that the relationship is serious.

41
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:37,008
You know,
that it's going somewhere.

42
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:40,724
All that built-in romance, mingling
with the family, hidden tensions.

43
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:43,642
All the more reason to have
a nice, simple, private wedding.

44
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:46,762
Nice try, mister.

45
00:03:46,929 --> 00:03:49,648
Okay, wedding planner
tomorrow at 11.

46
00:03:49,809 --> 00:03:52,846
No getting out of it,
no orbing out of it, nothing.

47
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:54,362
Don't even try it.

48
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:20,162
I don't know. I just don't want her

49
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:21,967
to set herself up
for a big disappointment.

50
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:24,689
How do you have a normal wedding
when a ghost will be presiding

51
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:27,317
- and the groom's dead?
- Leo, don't even try and figure it out.

52
00:04:27,489 --> 00:04:29,002
All right? It's the Cinderella complex.

53
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:30,443
Every girl goes through it.

54
00:04:30,609 --> 00:04:33,282
I've been dreaming
of this day my entire life.

55
00:04:33,609 --> 00:04:36,282
- Piper's wedding?
- No, mine.

56
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:38,758
I mean, I'm the oldest.
I'm supposed to do everything first.

57
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:40,885
I'm supposed to talk first,
and get braces,

58
00:04:41,049 --> 00:04:43,563
and get a boyfriend,
and find a husband.

59
00:04:44,049 --> 00:04:45,562
Hey, Prue?

60
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:47,162
Can I borrow your lipstick?

61
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:50,207
- What?
- Lipstick, I'm out. Do you mind?

62
00:04:51,609 --> 00:04:53,884
Sure, knock yourself out.

63
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:56,447
You're welcome!

64
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:13,438
Speaking of Phoebe, isn't it
time to let her off the hook?

65
00:05:13,609 --> 00:05:15,327
I mean, she came clean about Cole.

66
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:17,964
Leo, you can't just pretend
to vanquish a demon

67
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:21,246
and then two months later say,
"Gee, guys, I'm sorry, I didn't."

68
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:22,683
I know, but for what it's worth,

69
00:05:22,849 --> 00:05:24,919
I don't think she wants him
back in her life anymore.

70
00:05:25,089 --> 00:05:27,967
Maybe not, but that doesn't mean
he's not gonna try and kill us again.

71
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:53,407
Dantalian.

72
00:05:54,049 --> 00:05:56,404
Priestess Dantalian.

73
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,567
Were you successful?

74
00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:08,438
She's as beautiful
as you said she'd be.

75
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,839
You're certain this
has touched her lips?

76
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:14,364
Absolutely. I watched her all night.

77
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:19,244
Not to be ungrateful...

78
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:24,126
...but what do you get out of making
Prue Halliwell my wife?

79
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:26,678
I'm a humble servant
of The Source, Zile.

80
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:29,120
I get nothing...

81
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:30,768
...other than the benefits
we all reap

82
00:06:30,929 --> 00:06:32,601
whenever good is turned evil.

83
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:34,885
Still, for all the unions
you've consecrated,

84
00:06:35,049 --> 00:06:37,438
it seems you should get something.
Especially for this one.

85
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:41,683
There is a spoil...

86
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:46,002
...that intrigues me.

87
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:49,161
The Halliwell Book of Shadows
is said to be

88
00:06:49,329 --> 00:06:51,479
the most magical of all tomes.

89
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:53,765
The witches' Book of Shadows?

90
00:06:53,929 --> 00:06:55,999
That shouldn't be too hard to get.

91
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:57,682
This one is.

92
00:06:57,849 --> 00:06:59,646
Evil can't touch it.

93
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:02,118
Although turning Prue evil

94
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:05,361
should turn her sisters
and their book evil, as well.

95
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:07,804
Their magic's interconnected.

96
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,846
Well, then, I'll get it for you myself,

97
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:12,477
as a token of my gratitude.

98
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:15,007
First things first.

99
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:20,164
Getting the witch here
so I can perform the ceremony.

100
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:22,445
That's what this potion is for.

101
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:26,047
Kiss her and it paralyzes her.

102
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:28,400
After I bind you in marriage,

103
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:32,164
she'll fall into a deep sleep, where
the transformation to evil will occur.

104
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:49,479
Okay, so the more traditional
the better, as far as I'm concerned.

105
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:51,844
The Wedding March starts
and I come down the stairs...

106
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:53,761
So no flower girl?

107
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:56,600
I don't know. Do I?

108
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:58,487
Unless you wanna ask Kate
down the street.

109
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:01,244
Great idea, maybe she can
bring some of her fairy friends.

110
00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:03,206
Or trolls, even better.

111
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:04,643
Trolls?

112
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:07,006
Right, trolls.

113
00:08:07,369 --> 00:08:09,837
Our father's side
of the family is very short.

114
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:11,886
- Right, let's skip the flower girl.
- Right.

115
00:08:12,049 --> 00:08:14,961
Well, I think we should at least
dress the banister with garlands.

116
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:18,041
Maybe even carry the floral theme
all the way to the altar.

117
00:08:19,609 --> 00:08:21,759
How many guests
are you planning on?

118
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:24,524
Let me think, 50, 60?

119
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:26,884
Sixty? Like who?

120
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:30,166
Well, there's all the
people from P3, friends,

121
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:32,126
and Darryl, and Dad, Mom.

122
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:35,362
Mom?

123
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:37,997
Piper, I don't really think
that you can count her.

124
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:40,967
- We'll have to, if she's going to eat.
- Trust me, she won't be eating.

125
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:42,881
I thought your mother passed on.

126
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,166
Right, she did.

127
00:08:45,849 --> 00:08:48,363
I just meant I hope
she's there in spirit.

128
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:50,808
You're right, that doesn't count.

129
00:08:50,969 --> 00:08:53,608
Now, have you thought about
what hors d'oeuvres you'd like,

130
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:55,361
by any chance?

131
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:57,326
Pigs in a blanket.

132
00:09:00,489 --> 00:09:03,799
Leo, I was... I was hoping
for something a bit more elegant!

133
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:06,363
I'll get that.

134
00:09:06,609 --> 00:09:08,247
Excuse us.

135
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:10,206
We still need to place
the ice sculpture.

136
00:09:10,369 --> 00:09:11,768
Hello? Oh, hi, Justin.

137
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:13,920
What is the matter with you?
Why are you doing this?

138
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:17,081
Because this is a disaster
waiting to happen, that's why.

139
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:19,925
Well, keep that up and it will be.

140
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:21,966
Piper, I love you.

141
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:24,882
And I want nothing more for you
than to have your dream wedding.

142
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:26,528
But you are kidding
yourself with this.

143
00:09:26,689 --> 00:09:29,761
We don't need wedding planners,
we just need us.

144
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:32,159
You may not need
wedding planners, but I do.

145
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:34,081
I don't wanna have
to worry about anything.

146
00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:36,319
Therefore, if I have
to fight a demon in the morning,

147
00:09:36,489 --> 00:09:38,844
I know that the flowers
will still be there on time.

148
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:41,159
It's not the flowers
I'm worried about, it's the guests.

149
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:43,160
As in how do we explain
everything to them?

150
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:46,241
I mean, a whitelighter marrying
a witch is hardly traditional.

151
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:47,922
Obviously.

152
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:54,078
Okay, Justin,
I'll meet you there. Bye.

153
00:09:54,249 --> 00:09:56,604
- Hey, Phoebe...
- I'm running late for school.

154
00:09:56,769 --> 00:09:59,203
- Do you want a ride?
- Isn't Justin picking you up for lunch?

155
00:09:59,369 --> 00:10:01,087
His car broke down
so I'm meeting him there.

156
00:10:01,249 --> 00:10:02,921
And I thought that...

157
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:04,204
...we could talk, you know?

158
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:06,883
Try and put this whole Cole
situation behind us.

159
00:10:07,249 --> 00:10:08,648
I gotta go.

160
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:11,803
Okay, tell me the truth.

161
00:10:11,969 --> 00:10:14,688
Do you think I'm overdoing
it with the wedding stuff?

162
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:16,363
Hello?

163
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:20,003
Okay, why is Phoebe going
to school without her books?

164
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:23,286
Okay, why is Prue not answering
Piper's question?

165
00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:24,802
Maybe because she doesn't want

166
00:10:24,969 --> 00:10:26,800
both of her sisters
not speaking to her.

167
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:29,083
Okay, I have to go meet Justin.

168
00:10:29,249 --> 00:10:31,444
- Can I have my lipstick back?
- What lipstick?

169
00:10:31,609 --> 00:10:33,759
The one that you borrowed
last night at the club.

170
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:36,528
Wasn't me.

171
00:10:36,689 --> 00:10:39,249
Right, I must have gotten
you confused with another Piper.

172
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:44,204
Okay, you have fun with what's going
on here, because it looks great.

173
00:10:44,369 --> 00:10:45,688
Okay, bye.

174
00:10:55,849 --> 00:10:57,123
Cole?

175
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:00,968
Phoebe.

176
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:22,521
I knew you'd know
where to find me.

177
00:11:25,849 --> 00:11:28,409
That is for ruining my favourite movie.

178
00:11:28,569 --> 00:11:30,719
And, oh, yeah, my life too!

179
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:32,920
- Phoebe...
- I don't wanna hear it, Cole.

180
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:35,967
I'm over you. I want nothing
to do with you anymore.

181
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:38,368
- I don't believe that.
- Oh, yeah?

182
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:40,201
Believe it, because
if I ever see you again,

183
00:11:40,369 --> 00:11:42,439
I'm gonna do what I should
have done a long time ago,

184
00:11:42,609 --> 00:11:44,122
which is vanquish your sorry ass.

185
00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:47,647
Apparently, distance hasn't exactly
made the heart grow fonder.

186
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:50,882
Phoebe, wait.

187
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:54,246
Hey! Look, I took a huge risk coming
out in the open and contacting you.

188
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:56,320
The least you can do
is hear me out!

189
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:03,528
I've been hiding this whole time,

190
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:05,281
shimmering from realm
to realm to realm

191
00:12:05,449 --> 00:12:08,327
to keep The Source from realizing
you didn't vanquish my sorry ass.

192
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:11,486
You're the only one
who knows I'm alive.

193
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:13,526
Actually, that's not true.

194
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:16,203
I couldn't keep lying to my sisters.
I had to tell them.

195
00:12:17,049 --> 00:12:18,323
Okay.

196
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:20,878
That's okay. I understand.

197
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:22,960
As long as you didn't tell Leo.

198
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:25,964
For God's sake, why didn't you
just put an ad in the paper?

199
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:29,087
- Tell the whole damn world!
- You know, maybe I should have!

200
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:38,168
I risked my life for you,
Phoebe, my soul.

201
00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:41,525
I've put myself in more danger
coming back here

202
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:43,168
than you could possibly imagine.

203
00:12:43,489 --> 00:12:46,447
Because I wanna try and figure out
a way to make this work between us.

204
00:12:46,929 --> 00:12:48,760
Good and evil can't work together.

205
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:50,920
- We did before.
- I learned from my mistakes.

206
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:52,488
So did I.

207
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:55,806
Phoebe, I can suppress
my demonic half

208
00:12:55,969 --> 00:12:58,437
just like I suppressed
my human half before we met.

209
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:02,403
I can be good. You've seen that.

210
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:05,481
And if you know I can,
then why can't we be together?

211
00:13:07,729 --> 00:13:09,287
It's too late.

212
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:36,446
- Hey. Sorry about my car.
- Hey.

213
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:39,726
- Thanks for meeting me here.
- Oh, that's okay. It's not a...

214
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:41,363
...problem.

215
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:43,248
What?

216
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,042
Nothing.

217
00:13:45,569 --> 00:13:47,560
You know, I really
should sell that old thing

218
00:13:47,729 --> 00:13:50,402
but, I don't know.
I kind of like having something

219
00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:53,527
not so predictable
in this day and age.

220
00:13:54,489 --> 00:13:57,208
- Know what I mean?
- Right. So...

221
00:13:57,889 --> 00:13:59,925
...you don't think
of yourself as predictable?

222
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,080
- Me?
- Pardon me.

223
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:05,602
- Beringer, private reserve.
- Yes, thank you.

224
00:14:07,369 --> 00:14:09,837
Predictable? Hardly.

225
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:11,762
Right.

226
00:14:15,369 --> 00:14:16,768
Hey, Justin.

227
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:18,601
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

228
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:20,361
I'm picking up Prue for lunch.

229
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,601
Piper?

230
00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:28,324
- Is something wrong?
- I'm not sure.

231
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:30,037
- What's up?
- Where's Prue?

232
00:14:30,689 --> 00:14:32,919
I don't know.
At the restaurant, I guess.

233
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:34,363
Supposedly meeting Justin.

234
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:37,566
- No, I told her I'd pick her up here.
- Okay, so you didn't call this morning

235
00:14:37,729 --> 00:14:40,562
and tell her that your car broke down
and you'd meet her there?

236
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:42,685
No.

237
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:48,085
Oh, no, no.
I have to work this afternoon.

238
00:14:48,249 --> 00:14:51,400
Well, so your photographs are
a little fuzzy. Call it "avant-garde."

239
00:14:54,049 --> 00:14:56,005
How important can it be?

240
00:14:59,169 --> 00:15:00,363
What?

241
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:02,927
Can I ask you a favour?

242
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:05,078
Sure.

243
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,724
Last night when we kissed
goodbye it was...

244
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:09,607
...I don't know, not great.

245
00:15:09,969 --> 00:15:11,402
Yeah.

246
00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:13,321
How about we try it again?

247
00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:15,878
See if we can't do it a little better?

248
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:17,923
Come on.

249
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:20,162
What's the worst
that could happen?

250
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:47,402
Where am I?

251
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:51,888
I can't move.

252
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:53,926
My apologies.

253
00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:07,247
It's true.

254
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:10,003
Every bride is beautiful
on her wedding day.

255
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:28,807
- Find her?
- Not yet.

256
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:31,239
- We're screwed.
- Not yet.

257
00:16:34,569 --> 00:16:37,163
- Leo, what did you find out?
- Nothing.

258
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:38,923
Okay, now we're screwed.

259
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:41,045
Nothing on the map,
nothing in the Book.

260
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:43,200
Leo, somebody must
know something.

261
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,439
The Elders support
your shape-shifting warlock theory,

262
00:16:45,609 --> 00:16:47,440
but they can't get
a clear read on the situation.

263
00:16:47,729 --> 00:16:50,641
Wait. So Prue's vanished
from your radar

264
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,562
- and something's jamming theirs?
- Something like that.

265
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:54,923
But she can't be dead.

266
00:16:55,089 --> 00:16:57,478
They'd be able to sense that,
no matter how evil is interfering.

267
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,403
Okay, then what's going on?
What are we up against?

268
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:03,367
Something powerful enough
to keep us from finding her.

269
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:05,645
Well, you knew as your powers
grew, evil's would too.

270
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:08,198
Yeah, so powerful that
we can't figure out who they are,

271
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:10,246
let alone how to fight them?
That sucks.

272
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:13,719
All right, what we need to figure out
is why a warlock wants Prue alive.

273
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:15,568
Well, it can't just be for her powers.

274
00:17:15,729 --> 00:17:17,959
I mean, they wouldn't need
to keep her alive to get them.

275
00:17:18,129 --> 00:17:20,723
Unless it's an upper-level
warlock which wants...

276
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:22,568
All of our powers.

277
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:26,286
But we still have the same problem,
no idea how to find her.

278
00:17:27,249 --> 00:17:30,161
It's too bad you vanquished
that demonic bounty hunter.

279
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,640
Could have helped.

280
00:17:33,329 --> 00:17:34,967
Right.

281
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:38,361
Where are you going?

282
00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:40,522
I have a hunch.

283
00:17:40,689 --> 00:17:42,202
Wait for me.

284
00:17:52,009 --> 00:17:53,567
Shall we begin?

285
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:55,763
I'm ready.

286
00:17:56,489 --> 00:17:58,207
I hope so.

287
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:03,283
In the beginning, we were damned.

288
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:06,088
And through damnation,
we found freedom,

289
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:08,524
power and purpose.

290
00:18:09,449 --> 00:18:11,804
As I unite you today...

291
00:18:11,969 --> 00:18:14,324
...I remind you of those gifts.

292
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:17,519
And in your union...

293
00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:20,603
...may these gifts increase...

294
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:24,603
...so your powers may grow
in the service of...

295
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:26,328
...evil.

296
00:18:26,969 --> 00:18:28,721
So be it.

297
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:33,843
How long before her
transformation is complete?

298
00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:35,283
Sundown.

299
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:36,882
Can you wait that long?

300
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,119
For the power
of the Charmed Ones?

301
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:41,359
I can wait a few hours.

302
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,757
Let me be the first
to congratulate you.

303
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:01,158
Why?

304
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:04,719
Because I'm tired of bestowing
great power on others.

305
00:19:05,249 --> 00:19:09,959
The Halliwell Book of Shadows
is the key to unbelievable power,

306
00:19:10,129 --> 00:19:11,528
for me.

307
00:19:12,129 --> 00:19:15,087
Evil will spread from
this sister to the other two,

308
00:19:15,249 --> 00:19:16,682
and from them to the Book,

309
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:19,204
and once the Book is evil,
it'll be mine.

310
00:19:19,729 --> 00:19:22,960
And I will be unstoppable.

311
00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:27,439
But know this.

312
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:32,558
I will enjoy killing all of you.

313
00:19:37,449 --> 00:19:38,962
Cole?

314
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:40,728
Cole?

315
00:19:41,729 --> 00:19:43,765
Please, if you can hear me, l...

316
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:46,318
I was beginning to think
I'd never see you again.

317
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:47,763
I'm not here because of us.

318
00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:51,201
I need you to help me. If you do, it
doesn't change anything between us,

319
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:52,848
you have to know that.

320
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:58,165
- I'm listening.
- Prue was taken...

321
00:19:58,449 --> 00:20:00,360
...by a warlock.

322
00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:03,164
- Do you know which one?
- We think he's a shape-shifter.

323
00:20:03,329 --> 00:20:05,763
But the weird thing is, nobody
from our side can get a read

324
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:07,999
- on where he's hiding her.
- That doesn't make sense.

325
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:09,727
Warlocks don't have
that kind of power.

326
00:20:09,889 --> 00:20:11,607
He must be working
with somebody that does.

327
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:16,600
Certain dignitaries have
the power to shield their activities.

328
00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:19,408
Demonic judges, dark priests,

329
00:20:19,569 --> 00:20:21,764
anyone who needs
privacy for rituals.

330
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:24,366
What kind of rituals?
To accomplish what?

331
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:26,281
It's hard to say. It could be anything.

332
00:20:26,449 --> 00:20:28,883
They may want your book.
We all want your book.

333
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:31,919
- Really?
- I wanted the Book...

334
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:34,443
...at first.

335
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:37,079
Well, how can we find
out who wants it now?

336
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:42,123
I could check around, but I'd risk
demons finding out I was still alive.

337
00:20:44,249 --> 00:20:46,558
I'm sure there's still
a huge bounty on my head.

338
00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:48,728
I want my sister back.

339
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:51,363
No matter the cost?

340
00:20:52,489 --> 00:20:54,639
I want my sister back.

341
00:21:02,209 --> 00:21:05,201
I'm doing this for you.

342
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:06,928
Know that.

343
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:19,488
Now I'm really confused.

344
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:21,762
Me too.

345
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:23,044
I...

346
00:21:23,209 --> 00:21:25,518
I don't... I don't know
where that came from.

347
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:29,882
Okay.

348
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:32,040
I better go.

349
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:36,685
Listen, if you don't
hear back from me...

350
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:38,487
...I got caught.

351
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:55,607
I thought you said there
was nothing in the Book.

352
00:21:55,769 --> 00:21:59,523
Well, now there's just
a whole bunch of weirdness in it.

353
00:21:59,689 --> 00:22:01,122
Look.

354
00:22:01,409 --> 00:22:03,639
Hemlock killing spell?
That doesn't belong in here.

355
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:05,527
But it does have possibilities.

356
00:22:06,089 --> 00:22:07,727
Piper.

357
00:22:08,209 --> 00:22:10,677
I'm sorry. I don't know what I was...

358
00:22:13,449 --> 00:22:15,280
Piper?

359
00:22:15,449 --> 00:22:17,917
In here, somehow.

360
00:22:21,369 --> 00:22:23,439
- You blinked.
- I did not!

361
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:26,487
- Only warlocks do that.
- Piper, you did it.

362
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,726
- Hey.
- Where have you been?

363
00:22:30,769 --> 00:22:32,487
Brainstorming.
How's it going here?

364
00:22:33,089 --> 00:22:34,488
Your sister's blinking.

365
00:22:35,489 --> 00:22:37,684
l... I'm... I'm sorry, what?

366
00:22:38,409 --> 00:22:41,446
Okay, I admit it was definitely weird.
But it was kind of fun.

367
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:44,123
I was... I was in there,
and I was thinking about the kitchen.

368
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:46,166
And then, suddenly, boom!
Here I was.

369
00:22:46,329 --> 00:22:47,648
That is so cool.

370
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:49,527
Except that it's a warlock's power.

371
00:22:49,689 --> 00:22:51,919
So what? They're always
trying to get one of ours.

372
00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:53,920
It's about time we get one of theirs.

373
00:22:54,089 --> 00:22:57,126
- Try it, Pheebs.
- Okay, what do I do? Just think?

374
00:22:57,289 --> 00:22:58,722
And blink.

375
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:05,841
Catch us if you can!

376
00:23:12,489 --> 00:23:15,049
Have you tried it yet, Leo?
It's a real head rush.

377
00:23:15,209 --> 00:23:16,562
Do you realize how serious this is?

378
00:23:17,089 --> 00:23:18,966
You're blinking,
the Book is changing.

379
00:23:19,129 --> 00:23:21,006
Maybe we're blinking
because of the Book.

380
00:23:21,169 --> 00:23:22,841
The Book is changing
because of you.

381
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:24,886
It is an extension of you.

382
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:27,447
I should care about that.

383
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:28,962
But I don't.

384
00:23:30,969 --> 00:23:32,482
This is what I was afraid of.

385
00:23:32,649 --> 00:23:35,004
Whoever's got Prue
is somehow reaching you too.

386
00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:37,205
Okay, Leo, I can tell
this really upsets you,

387
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:40,247
but I gotta tell you I really like this
whole "think and it happens" deal.

388
00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:42,923
I mean, just think of the time
we could save not chanting.

389
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:45,205
Piper, Phoebe,
you have to fight this.

390
00:23:47,129 --> 00:23:49,245
Or we could answer the door.

391
00:23:49,649 --> 00:23:51,128
For Prue's sake, stop!

392
00:23:51,609 --> 00:23:54,169
Don't tell me what to do.

393
00:23:56,489 --> 00:23:58,445
Phoebe, I need your help.

394
00:23:58,609 --> 00:24:00,759
I am so tired of helping people.

395
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:05,966
So glad you're home. We have some
floral sketches we'd like you to see.

396
00:24:06,129 --> 00:24:07,801
Now's not really a good time.

397
00:24:08,089 --> 00:24:10,478
They're welcome to come in, Leo.

398
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:14,039
I've revisited the dinner menu, Piper,
and you are going to be thrilled.

399
00:24:14,209 --> 00:24:16,279
I have some dynamic choices
that l...

400
00:24:16,449 --> 00:24:18,644
I want pigs in blankets.

401
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:28,999
It's nice to see a bride
who still has a sense of humour

402
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:30,488
this close to the big day.

403
00:24:30,689 --> 00:24:35,558
No, I want pigs in blankets.

404
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:46,880
Marie seems very scared.

405
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:49,085
I always had her pegged
as an ice queen.

406
00:24:49,769 --> 00:24:51,646
What a great idea.

407
00:24:56,169 --> 00:24:58,842
Now, there is a freezing
power with kick.

408
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:00,203
Have you guys lost your minds?

409
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:02,087
Oh, Leo, get onboard.

410
00:25:02,249 --> 00:25:04,205
Whatever it is, this is fabulous.

411
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:06,280
You can't imagine
the freedom, the power.

412
00:25:06,449 --> 00:25:08,963
Phoebe, that is evil talking.
You have to fight it.

413
00:25:09,129 --> 00:25:11,040
- What did you ever see in him?
- I don't know.

414
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:13,040
He is kind of a stick-in-the-mud,
isn't he?

415
00:25:13,209 --> 00:25:15,359
Oh, another great idea.

416
00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:17,882
May I?

417
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:19,880
Be my guest.

418
00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:22,438
All right, think about the power of...

419
00:25:27,089 --> 00:25:28,966
Look at all the fun
we've been missing.

420
00:25:29,129 --> 00:25:31,518
And this is just the beginning.

421
00:25:33,129 --> 00:25:34,801
See you, Leo.

422
00:25:55,489 --> 00:25:57,525
Just the beginning.

423
00:26:10,649 --> 00:26:12,560
Oh, you know, it's your wedding.

424
00:26:12,729 --> 00:26:15,004
Shouldn't the first kill be yours?

425
00:26:15,529 --> 00:26:17,121
This is too easy. It's boring.

426
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:18,927
I wanna do something bigger.

427
00:26:19,089 --> 00:26:20,568
Count me in.

428
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:24,444
You know, if what's happening
to us is happening to Prue...

429
00:26:24,609 --> 00:26:27,203
Then the power of three
can be truly amazing.

430
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:29,487
We have to find her.

431
00:26:30,329 --> 00:26:32,240
But first, we need to clean house.

432
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:42,360
I'm sorry. What were you saying?

433
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:44,082
You're fired.

434
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:54,528
Oh, no.

435
00:26:55,289 --> 00:26:57,086
What are we gonna do
with the stick-in-the-mud?

436
00:26:57,289 --> 00:27:00,565
Wait. I think we can have
some fun with it.

437
00:27:05,129 --> 00:27:06,528
What happened to Craig and Marie?

438
00:27:06,889 --> 00:27:10,006
Oh, they flew right out of here.
It scared the hell out of them.

439
00:27:10,769 --> 00:27:12,327
Leo, we need to find Prue.

440
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:15,043
Good, Phoebe, focus on that.
It'll help you resist the evil.

441
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:17,929
The only thing we're resisting
is the desire to rip you to pieces

442
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:19,727
and have you for lunch.

443
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:22,278
But if you help us find Prue,
we'll leave you alone...

444
00:27:22,489 --> 00:27:23,888
...for the moment.

445
00:27:24,929 --> 00:27:27,363
Oh, Leo, ignore them.
What do they know?

446
00:27:27,569 --> 00:27:29,446
They're backing a losing team.

447
00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:31,361
They're revoking my assignment.

448
00:27:31,969 --> 00:27:33,607
What? They can't do that.

449
00:27:33,929 --> 00:27:36,238
You haven't done
anything wrong yet.

450
00:27:36,449 --> 00:27:38,724
You did. You gave in to evil.

451
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:41,849
You've relinquished your right
to a whitelighter.

452
00:27:45,329 --> 00:27:47,047
I'm sorry.

453
00:27:48,649 --> 00:27:52,608
- Well.
- Oh, no. He's gone.

454
00:27:53,449 --> 00:27:55,485
- We're free.
- Yes.

455
00:27:55,689 --> 00:27:58,647
No more obeying the rules,
considering the consequences,

456
00:27:58,809 --> 00:27:59,844
none of that crap.

457
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:02,648
- Time to find Prue and go for broke.
- Where are you going?

458
00:28:02,929 --> 00:28:05,762
Well, I can't wreak havoc
dressed like this.

459
00:28:14,889 --> 00:28:16,800
- Phoebe.
- Cole.

460
00:28:17,249 --> 00:28:19,160
- You're okay.
- Yeah.

461
00:28:19,369 --> 00:28:20,358
Barely.

462
00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:22,884
- Any demons spot you?
- Just one.

463
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:24,882
- Oh, no.
- No worries.

464
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:26,721
He won't be telling anybody anything.

465
00:28:27,849 --> 00:28:30,488
The big, bad Belthazor strikes again.

466
00:28:31,369 --> 00:28:32,961
Not anything I'm proud of.

467
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,602
Why not?

468
00:28:34,769 --> 00:28:36,521
You should be.

469
00:28:43,129 --> 00:28:45,689
Phoebe, if what I found out is true,
Prue's in serious trouble.

470
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,601
She's been forced to marry
a warlock.

471
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:50,482
Figures that bitch
would steal Piper's thunder.

472
00:28:51,649 --> 00:28:53,287
You don't understand.

473
00:28:53,449 --> 00:28:55,167
A high-level priestess
named Dantalian

474
00:28:55,329 --> 00:28:56,842
is rumoured to have married them.

475
00:28:57,009 --> 00:29:01,719
And she's got the power to turn
Prue evil, and turn you evil too.

476
00:29:01,889 --> 00:29:04,084
That's what's happening here.

477
00:29:04,249 --> 00:29:05,921
So?

478
00:29:06,089 --> 00:29:08,478
Isn't that the way you want me?

479
00:29:12,889 --> 00:29:14,163
No.

480
00:29:14,329 --> 00:29:17,366
That is not how I want you to be.
It's not how I want us to be.

481
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:19,997
Our only chance is if we're both...

482
00:29:20,169 --> 00:29:21,807
...good.

483
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:23,322
Love is love.

484
00:29:23,649 --> 00:29:27,278
There's no such thing as evil love.
It's just gratification, lust.

485
00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:28,638
You know what, Cole?

486
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:31,721
Your human half is kind of preachy.

487
00:29:31,889 --> 00:29:34,005
I think I want Belthazor back.

488
00:29:34,529 --> 00:29:35,757
He's not coming back.

489
00:29:35,969 --> 00:29:37,527
Oh, no?

490
00:29:41,209 --> 00:29:44,326
I want Belthazor!

491
00:29:51,209 --> 00:29:52,767
That's more like it.

492
00:29:53,649 --> 00:29:55,685
Phoebe, what are you doing?

493
00:29:56,089 --> 00:29:58,319
Dantalian is coming for your book.

494
00:29:58,889 --> 00:30:00,561
You better be ready.

495
00:30:03,289 --> 00:30:06,725
- What's going on in here?
- Nothing, unfortunately.

496
00:30:06,929 --> 00:30:09,523
- I heard voices.
- Oh, did you?

497
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,567
I had a premonition.

498
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:13,878
Must've gotten pretty loud.

499
00:30:14,249 --> 00:30:15,762
I guess.

500
00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:17,078
We gotta go.

501
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:20,918
The high priestess that has Prue,
supposedly she's coming here.

502
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:23,200
High pr...?

503
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:27,328
Must've been a hell
of a premonition.

504
00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:48,606
It's time.

505
00:31:07,609 --> 00:31:09,122
That was easy.

506
00:31:10,289 --> 00:31:11,483
Too easy.

507
00:31:22,249 --> 00:31:23,364
Where's our sister?

508
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,482
I can help you.

509
00:31:26,649 --> 00:31:28,082
I can teach you evil.

510
00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:31,520
You're new at it. You don't know
how to realize its full potential.

511
00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:34,125
I don't know, I think
we're getting the hang of it.

512
00:31:34,329 --> 00:31:35,808
Wanna see?

513
00:31:36,849 --> 00:31:38,407
Where's Prue?

514
00:31:38,969 --> 00:31:41,529
Kill me, and you'll never
see her again.

515
00:31:43,009 --> 00:31:46,319
So maybe we should
just torture you instead.

516
00:31:51,969 --> 00:31:54,483
Why don't you just shatter her hand
and see what happens.

517
00:32:00,929 --> 00:32:01,998
Last chance.

518
00:32:03,329 --> 00:32:04,808
Fine.

519
00:32:09,569 --> 00:32:13,198
Now, the really weird thing is
we could do that to the other hand.

520
00:32:13,689 --> 00:32:16,249
And then go down to your feet...

521
00:32:16,449 --> 00:32:19,327
Actually, we could work up piece
by piece, all the way to her head.

522
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:21,837
Where is Prue?

523
00:32:25,089 --> 00:32:27,284
I just couldn't leave like that, Piper.

524
00:32:33,489 --> 00:32:34,842
What's going on?

525
00:32:35,009 --> 00:32:37,204
Well, you just helped her to escape.

526
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:39,246
That's what's going on.

527
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:46,961
Smash him.

528
00:32:56,689 --> 00:32:58,441
Bastard.

529
00:33:10,129 --> 00:33:13,599
Death alone will not suffice,
my dear bride.

530
00:33:14,769 --> 00:33:17,761
Not anymore. Not after this.

531
00:33:26,889 --> 00:33:30,279
Welcome to my hell.

532
00:33:30,489 --> 00:33:31,922
So, what are we
supposed to do now?

533
00:33:32,089 --> 00:33:33,647
I don't know, kill innocents?

534
00:33:33,809 --> 00:33:35,208
No, I mean about Prue.

535
00:33:35,369 --> 00:33:37,599
How are we supposed to find her
without the Book?

536
00:33:37,769 --> 00:33:41,045
Shouldn't you be mourning the loss
of your beloved Leo?

537
00:33:41,209 --> 00:33:43,518
Phoebe, I'm serious.
That was one pissed-off priestess,

538
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:47,568
and if she kills Prue, she takes
the evil power of three along with her

539
00:33:47,769 --> 00:33:49,487
- and we won't stand a chance.
- Good point.

540
00:33:49,689 --> 00:33:51,407
We have to find Prue.

541
00:33:52,249 --> 00:33:54,080
Wait a minute.
We're warlocks, right?

542
00:33:54,289 --> 00:33:55,961
We should be able to blink
wherever we want.

543
00:33:56,129 --> 00:33:57,562
But we don't know where to blink to.

544
00:33:57,729 --> 00:33:59,128
We don't have to know where.

545
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:00,688
Just to who.

546
00:34:01,129 --> 00:34:04,405
To Prue. I mean, isn't that how
Leo's orbing power worked?

547
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,964
Yeah, but his power was jammed.
He couldn't find her.

548
00:34:07,169 --> 00:34:09,808
That's because he was good.
And we're evil.

549
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:16,605
"Through this book, weave this spell
Create the pain of heaven to hell

550
00:34:16,769 --> 00:34:17,963
May she suffer..."

551
00:34:19,169 --> 00:34:20,522
Are we there yet?

552
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:23,362
- Prue.
- Too late.

553
00:34:23,569 --> 00:34:25,241
- I've got the Book.
- Yeah, well, you know,

554
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:27,604
it takes a while to learn how to use it.
Trust us.

555
00:34:27,809 --> 00:34:30,846
How about in the meantime,
I freeze your head and shatter it?

556
00:34:33,609 --> 00:34:37,488
I may not be powerful enough
to fight you yet, but they are.

557
00:34:42,609 --> 00:34:45,282
- Prue.
- Hey, hi. You don't look so good.

558
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:47,121
Oh, but that's a great dress.

559
00:34:47,329 --> 00:34:50,401
Zile, Prue, eliminate them.

560
00:34:50,609 --> 00:34:53,601
Prue, ignore her. Come on.
Come with us. We're your sisters.

561
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,840
I'm his wife, not your sister.

562
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:08,724
All right, I'll take that as a no.

563
00:35:08,929 --> 00:35:12,478
Okay, we have to figure out a way
to get Prue on our side and fast.

564
00:35:12,649 --> 00:35:14,640
How about we get her a divorce?

565
00:35:24,769 --> 00:35:27,408
Don't wanna shatter
the wrong sister, now, do you?

566
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:33,804
- I love you.
- You too.

567
00:35:34,609 --> 00:35:36,361
Welcome to planet Narcissus.

568
00:35:36,689 --> 00:35:39,283
Wait a minute.
Cole said that evil can't love.

569
00:35:39,769 --> 00:35:41,441
- Cole?
- Never mind.

570
00:35:41,609 --> 00:35:44,123
The point is, she didn't say,
"I love you too."

571
00:35:49,929 --> 00:35:51,282
She's the warlock. Freeze her!

572
00:35:55,089 --> 00:35:56,078
I'll shatter her.

573
00:35:56,289 --> 00:35:57,358
- Hurry.
- No!

574
00:35:57,609 --> 00:35:59,088
Zile!

575
00:36:03,169 --> 00:36:04,648
What's going on?

576
00:36:05,529 --> 00:36:07,247
I think we're back.

577
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:10,008
All of us.

578
00:36:13,929 --> 00:36:15,442
The Book is back too.

579
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:17,801
Let's go do something good with it.

580
00:36:23,649 --> 00:36:27,722
Powers of light, magic of right
Cast this blight into forever's night

581
00:36:35,969 --> 00:36:38,324
Well, that was the wedding from hell.

582
00:36:39,049 --> 00:36:42,803
Although I guess I was the first
to get married, after all.

583
00:36:43,929 --> 00:36:46,124
- Oh, no. Leo.
- What?

584
00:36:47,529 --> 00:36:48,723
We killed him.

585
00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:05,166
Oh, Leo.

586
00:37:21,209 --> 00:37:23,245
Thank God you're okay.

587
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:25,923
Actually, it had more to do
with what you guys did.

588
00:37:27,609 --> 00:37:32,080
Vanquishing Zile broke the bond and
reversed all the evil you had done.

589
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:35,047
I just hope the wedding planners
don't remember what we did to them.

590
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:37,245
Unfortunately, they will.

591
00:37:37,409 --> 00:37:39,525
But I doubt they'll believe
what happened.

592
00:37:40,849 --> 00:37:43,238
And unfortunately, you will.

593
00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:46,881
Oh, yeah.
Leo, sorry we killed you.

594
00:37:47,449 --> 00:37:48,723
It's okay, Phoebe.

595
00:37:48,889 --> 00:37:52,199
It wasn't the real you.
Or you, Piper.

596
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:53,802
Wasn't it?

597
00:37:54,169 --> 00:37:56,524
I mean, on some level,
it was me. I felt it.

598
00:37:57,089 --> 00:37:59,842
They didn't just plant evil
inside of me...

599
00:38:00,009 --> 00:38:01,567
...or us for that matter.

600
00:38:01,729 --> 00:38:04,368
There had to be something there
for them to turn to begin with.

601
00:38:04,569 --> 00:38:06,127
That doesn't make you evil, Prue.

602
00:38:06,329 --> 00:38:08,240
You have to choose
to be evil voluntarily.

603
00:38:09,129 --> 00:38:11,040
Well, I gotta admit it.

604
00:38:11,209 --> 00:38:13,404
- It was kind of fun.
- Phoebe.

605
00:38:13,569 --> 00:38:15,525
Well, it was fun for a while.

606
00:38:15,849 --> 00:38:18,443
I mean, to be able to do whatever
we wanted, whenever we wanted

607
00:38:18,609 --> 00:38:19,598
with no consequences.

608
00:38:20,129 --> 00:38:23,201
My fiancé being shattered
into a gazillion pieces

609
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:25,121
is a kind of a consequence.

610
00:38:25,289 --> 00:38:26,722
Thank you.

611
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:30,006
Still, I kind of understand
what Phoebe's saying.

612
00:38:30,969 --> 00:38:32,687
Wait, you do?

613
00:38:34,769 --> 00:38:37,363
Am I detecting a thaw in our rift?

614
00:38:37,529 --> 00:38:40,805
All I'm saying is if evil weren't
enticing, why would there be any?

615
00:38:40,969 --> 00:38:44,006
I mean, you know, to pretend
that we're never attracted to it is...

616
00:38:44,169 --> 00:38:46,558
It's like pretending
that it just doesn't exist.

617
00:38:46,729 --> 00:38:48,959
Something tells me Cole's
name is about to be brought up.

618
00:38:49,129 --> 00:38:52,201
Look, I definitely do not like the fact
that you lied to us

619
00:38:52,409 --> 00:38:54,445
about vanquishing him,
but I have to admit,

620
00:38:54,649 --> 00:38:58,437
after taking a trip down the dark side,
I sort of understand it a little bit better.

621
00:38:59,009 --> 00:39:03,844
The problem now is that I realize
that Justin is just so boring.

622
00:39:04,649 --> 00:39:06,719
Well, scratch one name
off the wedding guest list.

623
00:39:07,009 --> 00:39:08,681
Actually, scratch them all.

624
00:39:10,049 --> 00:39:12,324
I cave. Our lives are just
way too bizarre

625
00:39:12,489 --> 00:39:14,445
to have any sort of normal wedding.

626
00:39:14,609 --> 00:39:16,167
I don't know what I was thinking.

627
00:39:17,049 --> 00:39:19,358
Phoebe, by the way,
you never mentioned

628
00:39:19,529 --> 00:39:21,201
where you got that premonition from.

629
00:39:21,369 --> 00:39:23,166
- What premonition?
- The one that told us

630
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:24,728
about Dantalian.

631
00:39:25,249 --> 00:39:27,046
The one that saved our butts.

632
00:39:27,209 --> 00:39:28,562
Right.

633
00:39:29,009 --> 00:39:31,000
You know, something tells me
you wouldn't believe me

634
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:32,158
if I told you anyway.

635
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:37,966
So let's just say I got in touch
with my evil side.

636
00:39:38,689 --> 00:39:41,157
Something that I will never do again.

637
00:40:00,169 --> 00:40:02,922
- How did it go?
- Everything's back to normal again.

638
00:40:04,089 --> 00:40:06,728
- Good.
- Yeah.

639
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:08,968
Good.

640
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:14,245
It's not enough, is it?

641
00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:17,003
What I did doesn't change your mind
about us, does it?

642
00:40:18,689 --> 00:40:20,520
- No.
- Why not?

643
00:40:21,689 --> 00:40:23,919
- It's too complicated.
- Don't give me that.

644
00:40:24,129 --> 00:40:26,927
If nothing else, let's at least be honest
with each other. We owe that.

645
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:34,083
I love you.

646
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:40,047
And I will always love you.
Nothing can change that.

647
00:40:42,049 --> 00:40:43,926
It's just...

648
00:40:45,049 --> 00:40:47,085
The temptation, it's too much.

649
00:40:47,569 --> 00:40:52,165
And I can't take that risk
for me or my sisters.

650
00:40:52,649 --> 00:40:54,640
Phoebe, I'm telling you,
I'm not evil anymore.

651
00:40:54,809 --> 00:40:56,208
Maybe not on the surface.

652
00:40:58,329 --> 00:41:01,127
And maybe not even in your heart.

653
00:41:03,289 --> 00:41:06,759
But somewhere inside of you...

654
00:41:08,729 --> 00:41:10,447
...you'll always be.

655
00:41:12,689 --> 00:41:14,645
And you can't ever change that.

656
00:41:27,009 --> 00:41:28,647
Goodbye.

657
00:41:32,729 --> 00:41:35,004
I'm not giving up, Phoebe.

658
00:41:41,609 --> 00:41:43,839
I'm not going away.
