1
00:00:00,619 --> 00:00:02,206
Previously on Charmed

2
00:00:04,054 --> 00:00:05,887
Voilà. New identities.

3
00:00:05,887 --> 00:00:08,782
How is it you can see your other selves reflected in the mirror?

4
00:00:08,782 --> 00:00:09,887
It's part of the spell.

5
00:00:09,887 --> 00:00:12,208
You know, this just might work.

6
00:00:12,487 --> 00:00:13,557
Who is he?

7
00:00:13,592 --> 00:00:17,234
I don't know his name.
He's some guy that I used to see in the elevator all the time at work.

8
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:18,979
I'm Julie, Phoebe's cousin.

9
00:00:18,979 --> 00:00:20,891
Dex, Dex Lawson.

10
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:23,585
- Dex Lawson, nice to meet you Dex.
- Me too.

11
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:30,915
- Behind you!
- Shhh!

12
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:38,241
It could be that the Charmed Ones are still alive.

13
00:00:41,446 --> 00:00:43,328
What if a demon attacks when I'm out?

14
00:00:43,328 --> 00:00:45,585
They're not gonna attack, alright? They think you're dead.

15
00:00:45,585 --> 00:00:47,879
I mean not here, I mean anywhere, in general.

16
00:00:49,058 --> 00:00:50,802
Like "anywhere in the city"?

17
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,897
Yes, what am I supposed to do? Just ignore it?

18
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:57,750
I should have gone taller.
I always wanted to be taller.

19
00:00:58,033 --> 00:00:59,033
Are you listenning to me?

20
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:00,990
Yeah, just ignore it.

21
00:01:01,568 --> 00:01:02,791
Why did you got blond?

22
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:05,246
I don't know. I didn't have lot time to think about it.

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,427
Besides, I'm gonna like it.

24
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,595
Leo, the jingling is back.
Can you help me get rid of it?

25
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:12,987
Just ignore it.

26
00:01:13,497 --> 00:01:15,407
It's his advice for the day. Excuse me.

27
00:01:16,112 --> 00:01:17,832
I can't ignore it, it's relentless.

28
00:01:17,832 --> 00:01:20,149
What does that little witch want anyway?

29
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,028
I don't know, maybe she doesn't even know she's calling you.

30
00:01:22,377 --> 00:01:25,252
You know, sometimes new charges don't,
sometimes it's just subliminal.

31
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:27,527
How am I supposed to get my life back then?

32
00:01:27,527 --> 00:01:28,841
Your life? What about my life?

33
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,143
What about it?

34
00:01:32,877 --> 00:01:33,063
How am I supposed to marry a guy I just met in an elevator?

35
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:35,967
Excuse me, but I was obssessing first.

36
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:37,112
No, excuse me.

37
00:01:37,838 --> 00:01:38,875
No, actually, I was.

38
00:01:39,134 --> 00:01:41,286
I think marrying a complete stranger wins.

39
00:01:41,814 --> 00:01:44,126
I mean, he doesn't know who I really am.

40
00:01:44,934 --> 00:01:47,372
Yeah but he's a really really cute stranger and you know why?

41
00:01:47,372 --> 00:01:48,756
Guys, do you mind?

42
00:01:48,756 --> 00:01:50,529
At least he's not driving me crazy.

43
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:52,025
Maybe you should try medidate it.

44
00:01:52,201 --> 00:01:54,455
I just got my life back. I don't wanna get hitch yet.

45
00:01:54,455 --> 00:01:56,058
There's nothing wrong with being hitched.

46
00:01:56,059 --> 00:01:57,059
No guys, really,

47
00:01:57,536 --> 00:01:58,437
ok? Back to my life.

48
00:01:58,437 --> 00:02:00,838
Maybe I should go to magic school to get rid of it.

49
00:02:01,003 --> 00:02:01,680
He's cute.

50
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,453
But again you know,

51
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,738
I could risk exposure.

52
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:06,549
I don't even know what he does.

53
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:08,875
Familial meeting,

54
00:02:09,215 --> 00:02:10,124
now.

55
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:14,167
- If she didn't want to go to magic school, all she had to do is tell me.
- You're in trouble.

56
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:15,368
What to do...

57
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,886
It's abandonned.

58
00:02:25,165 --> 00:02:26,355
No one's here.

59
00:02:27,403 --> 00:02:29,028
Although they can still be invisible.

60
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,122
This is magic school after all.

61
00:02:32,636 --> 00:02:33,319
No.

62
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,176
The magic here is all ours now.

63
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:38,688
Are you sure?

64
00:02:51,348 --> 00:02:52,378
Positive.

65
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,200
Ok people we got to have a grip here.

66
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:51,573
Otherwise what are we doing?

67
00:03:51,573 --> 00:03:54,205
We might as well just go back to fighting demons again.

68
00:03:54,314 --> 00:03:55,754
Even if they think we're dead?

69
00:03:55,982 --> 00:03:57,587
It was a rethorical question.

70
00:03:57,816 --> 00:03:58,780
No, it wasn't.

71
00:03:59,301 --> 00:04:00,914
- Paige!
- What?

72
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,952
I think the point is that we need to take it slow you know, be patient.

73
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,760
Tell that to my premonition.

74
00:04:05,841 --> 00:04:07,429
And my stupid charge.

75
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:10,447
Don't even start.

76
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:12,985
- You know, you're gonna be late.
- Late for what?

77
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:18,502
My spa day. I'm supposed to be having any facial and a massage,
and a seaweed rapid thing.

78
00:04:18,818 --> 00:04:19,883
I'm so jealous.

79
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:23,132
Well, it was Phoebe's idea.
We were watching Sex And the City.

80
00:04:23,691 --> 00:04:24,410
Speaking of which,

81
00:04:24,446 --> 00:04:27,562
did Carrie ever have to marry a man she did not know?

82
00:04:28,174 --> 00:04:28,706
Carrie?

83
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,672
Don't ask her on Sex and the City,

84
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,534
again.

85
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:33,822
No, the answer is no. She did not.

86
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,095
Why can't we live our lives like they did?

87
00:04:37,463 --> 00:04:39,835
Uh... didn't one of them sleep around a lot?

88
00:04:39,952 --> 00:04:41,482
No, she was a free spirit.

89
00:04:41,611 --> 00:04:44,322
Which by the way can only happen when you're free.

90
00:04:45,715 --> 00:04:47,098
God! Is that really necessary?

91
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,684
Apparently. Look,

92
00:04:49,048 --> 00:04:51,121
Ok, nobody said that it was gonna be easy.

93
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,643
We need to get a little prospective here.

94
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:56,026
How bad can things be when we don't have demons to worry about anymore?

95
00:04:57,926 --> 00:04:58,611
Thank you.

96
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:04,403
Look, you. You need to focus on something else. You've gotta get that charge off your mind.

97
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,192
Well, people I am opened to suggestions.

98
00:05:07,397 --> 00:05:09,341
Do what Grams said. Get out there.

99
00:05:09,787 --> 00:05:13,671
Ignore the signs of your old life and look for signs that lead you to your new life.

100
00:05:14,095 --> 00:05:15,337
Try anything.

101
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:16,306
And you,

102
00:05:16,624 --> 00:05:17,667
you're all about signs.

103
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:20,610
So, isn't that exactly what a vision is anyway?

104
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:22,732
- Yeah but...
- Don't make me whistle.

105
00:05:24,051 --> 00:05:26,518
Last year you had a premonition that you were gonna have a daughter,

106
00:05:26,518 --> 00:05:30,370
which means that this year you're gonna have to have a little sex and get pregnant.

107
00:05:30,673 --> 00:05:34,926
And since Dex which coincidently rimes with "sex", could be the father.

108
00:05:35,262 --> 00:05:35,975
God!

109
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:38,129
Look, I suggest you to get to know him,

110
00:05:38,476 --> 00:05:39,958
well and fast,

111
00:05:40,614 --> 00:05:43,276
because this is maybe the one sign you can't ignore.

112
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:49,099
Alright? Everybody good, people?
Great. See you later.

113
00:05:54,223 --> 00:05:56,108
<i>Maybe Piper's right.</i>

114
00:05:56,109 --> 00:05:57,986
<i>I mean if there's one thing we've learned,</i>

115
00:05:57,986 --> 00:05:59,644
<i>it's that we'll be in guided.</i>

116
00:06:00,768 --> 00:06:02,610
<i>And signs always lead the way.</i>

117
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:06,333
<i>The question is : where do you start looking for them?</i>

118
00:06:06,522 --> 00:06:08,979
Start with Dex. See if you even like him.

119
00:06:16,215 --> 00:06:18,409
Isn't the fact that we can take this place over

120
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:20,576
proves enough that the Charmed Ones are really dead?

121
00:06:20,576 --> 00:06:22,373
Unless they are hidding.

122
00:06:22,722 --> 00:06:25,010
They would not leave magic school unprotected.

123
00:06:25,317 --> 00:06:25,439
Or leave its power for us to take.

124
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,987
Perhaps not.

125
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:29,571
But then again,

126
00:06:30,163 --> 00:06:31,949
that's the mystery we're trying to solve.

127
00:06:32,651 --> 00:06:33,680
Isn't it?

128
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:36,364
Speaking of witch,

129
00:06:37,237 --> 00:06:38,661
any progress on that front?

130
00:06:39,597 --> 00:06:42,007
We've lured three teenagers so far.

131
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:43,744
Turn them all,

132
00:06:44,406 --> 00:06:46,572
and yet no sign of the witches.

133
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,820
They won't be able to ignore the crisis for long.

134
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:51,152
If the sisters are alive,

135
00:06:51,793 --> 00:06:53,290
they will come to the rescue.

136
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:54,540
It's in their blood.

137
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,626
Unless your plan is too obscur for them to notice.

138
00:06:57,855 --> 00:06:59,918
Maybe you give them too much credit.

139
00:07:01,442 --> 00:07:04,638
Demons have used the mode of fairy tales just to trap them before.

140
00:07:05,737 --> 00:07:07,234
It's in the text book.

141
00:07:07,406 --> 00:07:11,059
How Cinderella already turned the Charmed Ones into pumpkins.

142
00:07:12,655 --> 00:07:14,691
Humans are raised on these insidous tales.

143
00:07:15,195 --> 00:07:18,679
They tap in the universe of beings common emotions : fears.

144
00:07:20,071 --> 00:07:22,750
That why we can lure the victims so easily.

145
00:07:24,252 --> 00:07:25,184
Don't worry,

146
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,633
sooner or later the Charmed Ones will follow, and when they do,

147
00:07:29,568 --> 00:07:31,071
we will have them.

148
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:34,242
What if they don't take the bait?

149
00:07:35,343 --> 00:07:36,654
What if they live no more?

150
00:07:36,846 --> 00:07:38,795
Well then we'll mess up a few kids,

151
00:07:39,324 --> 00:07:42,088
and that's fun all by itself, no?

152
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:49,313
Time to find our next Alice.

153
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,776
<i>Signs of course can be good or bad.</i>

154
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:55,559
<i>But they should never be ignored.</i>

155
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,445
I'm telling you, something really weird is going on.

156
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:01,735
I mean, come on! Why aren't the cops doing something about this?

157
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:03,278
It's totally ragged.

158
00:08:03,635 --> 00:08:07,282
- I don't know. They probably think this is drugs or something.
- It's not drugs. No way.

159
00:08:07,343 --> 00:08:10,452
This is something way more scary. But they just don't care.

160
00:08:10,856 --> 00:08:12,133
Nobody cares! We're teenagers!

161
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:15,112
No, that girl Alyson just turned 20.

162
00:08:15,774 --> 00:08:17,005
Who is Alyson?

163
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:18,264
Alyson?

164
00:08:18,644 --> 00:08:20,239
This sur-wordy chick that went missing?

165
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:23,798
That was later found walking around like her hard drive had just been erased?

166
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:25,508
Her hard drive?

167
00:08:25,734 --> 00:08:26,871
This isn't funny Billie.

168
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:31,356
This is serious. Some creep's out there praying on kids like us, and nobody's doing jack about it.

169
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,652
Don't you even care?

170
00:08:35,296 --> 00:08:37,954
Actually what I care about right now, is not being late for maths and physics,

171
00:08:38,508 --> 00:08:39,388
which I'm failing.

172
00:08:39,905 --> 00:08:41,488
Unbelievable.

173
00:08:42,132 --> 00:08:42,823
Whatever.

174
00:08:45,573 --> 00:08:49,071
All I got to say is that somebody better do something before anyone else gets hurt.

175
00:09:13,082 --> 00:09:15,184
<i>Signs don't always mean what we think they do.</i>

176
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,222
<i>They can after all be confusing.</i>

177
00:09:17,747 --> 00:09:21,650
<i>Especially into this world where we're constantly bombarded by them.</i>

178
00:09:22,097 --> 00:09:25,103
<i>Still it's up to us to interpretate them the best way we know how.</i>

179
00:09:25,285 --> 00:09:26,812
<i>It's called survival.</i>

180
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:34,771
You're going up?

181
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,898
Yeah, but not right now.
It's ok. Go ahead.

182
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:45,498
<i>Unfortunatly waiting for just the right sign to come along can be frustrating;</i>

183
00:09:45,498 --> 00:09:48,063
<i>especially when you're in a hurry to conceive.</i>

184
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,862
<i>Which is why sometimes you have to...</i>

185
00:09:53,938 --> 00:09:55,229
- Hi.
- Hi.

186
00:09:55,588 --> 00:09:57,730
<i>help make the signs come to you.</i>

187
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,589
Uh... It's Dex, right?

188
00:10:02,082 --> 00:10:06,230
Yeah, that's right. And you're... Julie.

189
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:07,704
You remembered?

190
00:10:07,704 --> 00:10:09,353
How could I forget it.

191
00:10:09,946 --> 00:10:14,321
<i>On the other hand, some signs come to you even when you wish they wouldn't.</i>

192
00:10:15,252 --> 00:10:16,551
Great. Just great.

193
00:10:20,212 --> 00:10:21,871
You driving licence please.

194
00:10:22,728 --> 00:10:23,790
What did I do?

195
00:10:24,131 --> 00:10:25,353
You went through a stop sign.

196
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:37,245
You're from L.A?

197
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,166
Yeah.

198
00:10:39,993 --> 00:10:42,858
My cousins died. So I just came here to help out.

199
00:10:43,249 --> 00:10:44,483
Waouh, sorry.

200
00:10:44,772 --> 00:10:49,003
Well, yeah, it's a little harder that I thought it would be.
You know adjusting to a new city and all.

201
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,299
What did you do before?

202
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:54,302
You could say help people.

203
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,182
Yeah? Maybe you should become a cop.

204
00:11:11,965 --> 00:11:13,116
What's a 920?

205
00:11:13,117 --> 00:11:14,117
Missing person found.

206
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:16,249
Probably another one of those kids.

207
00:11:17,534 --> 00:11:18,974
It looks like it's your lucky day.

208
00:11:20,225 --> 00:11:22,186
- Can I ask you a question?
- Make it fast.

209
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,677
What do you like most about your job?

210
00:11:26,443 --> 00:11:27,920
Catching the bad guys.

211
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:39,760
I had thought you've said we'd go to a garden party or something.

212
00:11:40,185 --> 00:11:41,769
We are, Allister, we are.

213
00:11:42,465 --> 00:11:43,078
Yeah?

214
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:44,927
You're sure this is the way?

215
00:11:46,448 --> 00:11:47,836
You don't wanna be late, do you?

216
00:11:49,017 --> 00:11:49,889
No but...

217
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:52,653
Because we're very very late.

218
00:11:53,442 --> 00:11:54,667
We're late for what?

219
00:11:57,492 --> 00:12:01,163
Look. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
Ok. I mean I really don't even know you.

220
00:12:13,007 --> 00:12:14,318
I promised you an adventure, didn't I?

221
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:17,230
Stand there.

222
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,505
What's down there?

223
00:12:23,787 --> 00:12:24,721
Secrets off.

224
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:27,465
Come on.

225
00:12:29,272 --> 00:12:31,003
Aren't at least a bit curious?

226
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:54,101
Rats.

227
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,773
Help. Anybody?

228
00:13:06,499 --> 00:13:07,326
Where am I?

229
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,088
You're down the rabbit hole.

230
00:13:10,551 --> 00:13:12,225
Allister in Wonderland.

231
00:13:13,732 --> 00:13:15,166
Close enough.

232
00:13:21,151 --> 00:13:23,722
This one I got the inspiration for a few years ago.

233
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:25,837
I was flying over Africa.

234
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:30,402
I was looking out of the window, you know,
painfully aware of the struggles below me,

235
00:13:30,402 --> 00:13:33,288
and yet sup up the clouds feeling at peace.

236
00:13:34,575 --> 00:13:42,795
It's supposed to remind us of the delicate balance between, you know, life, good, evil.
And I can see in it all that.

237
00:13:44,563 --> 00:13:48,184
All my work is... You know, art expression.

238
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:50,422
It's supposed to be enjoying the moment.

239
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,969
After all that's all we really have, isn't it?

240
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:55,993
I tend to believe too much in the future.

241
00:13:56,925 --> 00:13:58,748
I can't help with that. It's in my blood.

242
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:04,450
Anyway, it's great. I mean it's all great.

243
00:14:04,993 --> 00:14:06,644
Everything is great.

244
00:14:07,631 --> 00:14:11,611
And here I thought all this time you were a lawyer or something...

245
00:14:11,964 --> 00:14:15,002
But I thought you just got to town after Phoebe died.

246
00:14:15,705 --> 00:14:18,072
Oh yeah. You know, I did.

247
00:14:19,251 --> 00:14:21,842
It's just what Phoebe said.

248
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,736
I got what she said that you did.

249
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:27,425
It's all very sad.

250
00:14:30,505 --> 00:14:31,519
Sure, it must be hard.

251
00:14:32,366 --> 00:14:33,790
But life goes on, right?

252
00:14:34,745 --> 00:14:36,626
Isn't that the lesson in all of this?

253
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:38,675
Well, I don't know about lesson, but...

254
00:14:39,355 --> 00:14:41,844
No really, it's more than I can stand to learn.

255
00:14:42,396 --> 00:14:46,476
I actually often said that the worst part of modern technology

256
00:14:47,935 --> 00:14:49,778
is the way it robs you of the fine moments.

257
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:52,642
You know, the little discoveries,

258
00:14:53,396 --> 00:14:54,836
even intimacy.

259
00:14:57,888 --> 00:14:58,693
What?

260
00:14:59,025 --> 00:15:02,716
I was just thinking that... that's exactly what Phoebe once say.

261
00:15:03,358 --> 00:15:05,308
Really? That's odd.

262
00:15:06,025 --> 00:15:09,472
I mean, wrote in her advice column. That was like verbatim.

263
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:13,079
I don't know. It must run in the family, uh?

264
00:15:14,152 --> 00:15:15,215
Yeah, it must.

265
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:18,342
You really read her column, didn't you?

266
00:15:22,664 --> 00:15:24,198
Do you like to get a cup of coffee?

267
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,390
<i>It's not diner, or lunch even, but it's not bad.</i>

268
00:15:28,943 --> 00:15:30,079
I'd love to.

269
00:15:30,866 --> 00:15:34,274
<i>When you're in a hurry, you can't be too picky about the signs,</i>

270
00:15:34,706 --> 00:15:38,205
<i>as lons as it causes a few sparks, what more can you ask for.</i>

271
00:15:40,211 --> 00:15:43,342
<i>Fortunately, not every spark is a positive one.</i>

272
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,725
- Oh oh.
- Oh oh.

273
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,615
Uh... I think the transformer shut.

274
00:15:49,954 --> 00:15:51,177
Ok, fix it.

275
00:15:52,746 --> 00:15:55,445
I can't. I need a new one.

276
00:15:55,915 --> 00:15:58,535
Can you get a new one and replace it?

277
00:15:59,601 --> 00:16:02,125
It has to be ordered.
It could take a couple of days.

278
00:16:02,436 --> 00:16:04,752
A couple of days? I don't have a couple of days!

279
00:16:04,752 --> 00:16:08,896
This is nightclub. We've got music and lights and credit card machines.
I need electricity.

280
00:16:08,896 --> 00:16:10,328
I wish I can help you,

281
00:16:10,838 --> 00:16:14,179
but I couldn't even get an inspector at here before tomorrow anyway.

282
00:16:14,438 --> 00:16:16,035
An inspector? What inspector? For what?

283
00:16:16,427 --> 00:16:17,769
That's the code.

284
00:16:18,717 --> 00:16:21,787
- You wanna wait here while I give my call?
- No, I don't wanna wait here.

285
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:27,180
I'm not even supposed to be here.
I'm supposed beginning a manucure, and a pedicure and a facial and something else.

286
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:31,511
You don't really care, do you?

287
00:16:31,805 --> 00:16:33,293
I'm just an electrician Madam.

288
00:16:34,638 --> 00:16:37,917
Alright, you know what, Bud, is it?

289
00:16:38,371 --> 00:16:39,569
I don't really care, ok?

290
00:16:39,837 --> 00:16:40,727
Do whatever it takes.

291
00:16:40,928 --> 00:16:44,265
Get some solar pannels, run a generator, whatever.
But you know what?

292
00:16:44,489 --> 00:16:50,457
I need to have a little any bit of a light, ok?
Just a little tiny, tiny, tiny light. Is that ok with you?

293
00:16:54,238 --> 00:16:55,188
Sorry.

294
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:57,345
Sign please.

295
00:16:58,084 --> 00:16:58,932
Yeah.

296
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:02,776
<i>Of course, in the case of extreme things,
signs tend to balance each other out.</i>

297
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,313
<i>For instance, when one says "closed",</i>

298
00:17:07,342 --> 00:17:09,406
<i>an other says "come on in".</i>

299
00:17:12,526 --> 00:17:13,602
Can I help you?

300
00:17:13,637 --> 00:17:17,748
Oh hi. I'm just checking stuff out for a friend.

301
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:19,929
Does he to become a police officer?

302
00:17:20,184 --> 00:17:22,105
She actually and

303
00:17:22,572 --> 00:17:24,651
I think she's exploring her options.

304
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,605
I see.

305
00:17:26,354 --> 00:17:28,510
Well she could have picked one very noble profession.

306
00:17:29,726 --> 00:17:31,569
Did she have any background in law enforcement?

307
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:32,728
Unofficially.

308
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:34,818
She was a social worker

309
00:17:35,044 --> 00:17:37,916
and she's made an awful lot of citizens' arrests.

310
00:17:38,685 --> 00:17:42,802
Well, it's one thing to carry a pen,
quite another to carry a gun.

311
00:17:44,156 --> 00:17:45,645
- Have you ever fired a gun?
- Me?

312
00:17:46,753 --> 00:17:49,445
No. I mean, but this is about my...

313
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:50,915
your friend, yeah.

314
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:53,751
Look, don't take this the wrong way, ok, but

315
00:17:54,435 --> 00:17:56,715
I can tell by looking at you you don't have what it takes.

316
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,624
Excuse me?

317
00:17:59,906 --> 00:18:02,669
We're looking for serious committed minded young people,

318
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:07,284
and I'm the guy that has still to deal with the crazies, the nutsies and the attracted divorcies,

319
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:11,020
and those who waste attack spares arguying money.

320
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:13,010
You obviously don't know who you're talking to.

321
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,777
Well, don't take offense Ma'am.

322
00:18:15,047 --> 00:18:17,731
The fact is we only take the very best of the best.

323
00:18:17,732 --> 00:18:22,250
And that does not currently include anyone worried about breaking a nail.

324
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:24,654
You know what?

325
00:18:25,122 --> 00:18:27,356
Who dare you prejudge me?
You don't know the first thing about me.

326
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:31,027
You know, I could have saved the world like a hundred times over.

327
00:18:31,379 --> 00:18:33,143
Of course, yes. Good day.

328
00:18:33,523 --> 00:18:34,562
No, you know what?

329
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:38,766
I know you don't thing I can do this Mister six feet four big guy,
but I tell you what.

330
00:18:38,963 --> 00:18:39,948
I beg I can take you.

331
00:18:40,689 --> 00:18:41,733
Sure you could lady, sure.

332
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:42,734
Let me try.

333
00:18:43,216 --> 00:18:44,511
Do yourself a favor.

334
00:18:45,107 --> 00:18:46,634
Leave, now.

335
00:18:48,282 --> 00:18:50,908
Look, I don't have time for this crap.

336
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:02,300
The application is on the desk.

337
00:19:05,314 --> 00:19:06,128
Hey bunny.

338
00:19:08,005 --> 00:19:09,381
Here bunny, bunny.

339
00:19:12,688 --> 00:19:14,574
Bunny, don't be afraid.

340
00:19:15,215 --> 00:19:17,676
Bunny, I won't hurt you.

341
00:19:21,104 --> 00:19:22,337
Oh my God.

342
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:25,622
Sorry Alexis. Try again.

343
00:19:26,297 --> 00:19:28,373
You're ready for a wild ride?

344
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:34,740
Did you hear? They found an other one,
a boy this time.

345
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:36,669
Allister, I think his name was.

346
00:19:36,784 --> 00:19:38,274
Another A name.

347
00:19:38,537 --> 00:19:43,571
I'm telling you, it's just like that in Agatha Christie novel, the Alphabet Murders,
remember that?

348
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:47,744
I mean, I know it's not murders in this case,
but it might as well be.

349
00:19:48,142 --> 00:19:52,012
I mean those kids are coming back like zombies or something,
vegetables.

350
00:19:52,013 --> 00:19:53,013
It's awful.

351
00:19:53,089 --> 00:19:56,237
God only know what that sick pervert does to those poor kids.

352
00:19:58,028 --> 00:20:00,607
I'm sorry, no cell phones.

353
00:20:00,607 --> 00:20:03,261
Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you.

354
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:06,453
Hello?

355
00:20:06,454 --> 00:20:09,152
What? What?

356
00:20:09,598 --> 00:20:12,537
Leo, you locked yourself out of the house?

357
00:20:12,591 --> 00:20:14,025
With Wyatt?

358
00:20:14,449 --> 00:20:16,423
Oh come on!

359
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:20,197
Alright, you know what? Fine.
I'm on my way, I'm on my way!

360
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,553
Welcome cadets.

361
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:24,804
You've chosen become one of the few and the proud

362
00:20:25,887 --> 00:20:27,799
San Fransisco city police officer.

363
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,356
Off the next several days however,

364
00:20:30,356 --> 00:20:34,022
you will be screen for potentially disqualifying behavior.

365
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,895
You will be asked to critically analize a situation

366
00:20:37,182 --> 00:20:39,326
and determine an appropriate course of action.

367
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:41,387
You'll be expected to act deservedly,

368
00:20:41,387 --> 00:20:44,796
and without hesitation, but without overreacting.

369
00:20:45,946 --> 00:20:50,455
And you will be tested to see if you can make quick responsible decisions
under pressure.

370
00:20:50,966 --> 00:20:52,442
Am I making myself clear?

371
00:20:52,443 --> 00:20:53,443
Perfectly.

372
00:20:54,034 --> 00:20:54,992
What's your name, cadet?

373
00:20:56,013 --> 00:20:57,359
Jo Bennett.

374
00:20:57,783 --> 00:20:59,705
I keep an eye on you, Bennett.

375
00:21:01,467 --> 00:21:05,641
Making poor choices and failing exhibit sound judgment in a crisis situation...

376
00:21:05,956 --> 00:21:10,323
are all negative attributes that can and will disqualify you from this academy.

377
00:21:10,971 --> 00:21:14,854
<i>Sometimes signs are so obvious,
that only a fool can miss them.</i>

378
00:21:15,105 --> 00:21:16,787
<i>And Paige is no fool.</i>

379
00:21:21,216 --> 00:21:22,403
Oh, hi.

380
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,851
- You're alright?
- No.

381
00:21:25,893 --> 00:21:28,174
I've a horrible migraine.

382
00:21:28,902 --> 00:21:30,421
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to go.

383
00:21:32,362 --> 00:21:34,406
<i>It's not easy starting new lives,</i>

384
00:21:34,504 --> 00:21:35,745
<i>following new signs,</i>

385
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:39,076
<i>especially when the old ones keep getting in the way.</i>

386
00:21:40,658 --> 00:21:42,500
Oh, no fair, you moved!

387
00:21:56,447 --> 00:21:57,845
What do you try to do? Kill me?

388
00:22:00,998 --> 00:22:02,211
You again?

389
00:22:05,485 --> 00:22:07,149
Look what you did! I had her!

390
00:22:07,447 --> 00:22:09,693
Then why did you call for me? Again.

391
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:11,898
I didn't call you.
I don't even know you.

392
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:14,363
Then maybe your inner witch does,

393
00:22:14,363 --> 00:22:15,881
because sadly,

394
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:17,626
I'm your whitelighter.

395
00:22:18,091 --> 00:22:18,947
Whatever that means.

396
00:22:20,316 --> 00:22:20,985
Hey.

397
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:22,236
Let go off me.

398
00:22:22,236 --> 00:22:24,317
I can't. Not until I'll help you.

399
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,599
I don't need anybody's help.

400
00:22:27,441 --> 00:22:29,910
Well you need my help, whether you like it or not.

401
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:32,402
Are you a cop?

402
00:22:33,006 --> 00:22:34,497
- No.
- Good.

403
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:49,230
You're blond?

404
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:54,470
See you.

405
00:22:59,872 --> 00:23:00,765
Help.

406
00:23:01,307 --> 00:23:03,765
Somebody just tried to kidnap me.

407
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,276
Here you are.

408
00:23:12,326 --> 00:23:16,566
I got you your coffee drink. You know the one with cream, right?

409
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:17,787
Am I that predicitible?

410
00:23:17,787 --> 00:23:20,561
Well, everybody is when it comes to their coffee drink.

411
00:23:23,389 --> 00:23:25,967
Oh I take it it went well with Dex.

412
00:23:26,442 --> 00:23:27,628
Oh yes it did.

413
00:23:28,117 --> 00:23:30,622
I mean, I'm not ready to marry the guy obviously yet, but

414
00:23:31,352 --> 00:23:32,743
you know, I could do worse.

415
00:23:32,785 --> 00:23:35,362
Actually, you know, I've done worse before.

416
00:23:36,607 --> 00:23:39,912
Well you maybe want to take it a little bit slow despite your premonition.

417
00:23:39,912 --> 00:23:42,312
Do you know where Piper is? I've got her Cona Makiado.

418
00:23:42,312 --> 00:23:44,135
No, I don't. I just got home.

419
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:48,638
Paige, are you scrying?
You're not supposed to be scrying.

420
00:23:48,638 --> 00:23:51,537
Why don't you just go yell on my charge, ok?
She won't leave me alone.

421
00:23:52,113 --> 00:23:52,918
So you scalped her?

422
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:56,590
No, I did not.
I was out about when she called.

423
00:23:57,215 --> 00:23:59,764
And I found her fighting a demon.

424
00:24:00,302 --> 00:24:01,289
Another one?

425
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,037
How did she do?

426
00:24:05,094 --> 00:24:06,640
Not as good as she thought she did.

427
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,637
But at least she saved an innocent.

428
00:24:08,637 --> 00:24:10,378
An innocent? What innocent?

429
00:24:10,378 --> 00:24:11,953
One of those missing teens.

430
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,755
At least she didn't got to her first too late.

431
00:24:14,238 --> 00:24:18,786
I think that if I can find that little witch,
then I can finally be done with all of this stuff.

432
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:21,529
By vanquishing the demon?

433
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:22,741
That's the general idea.

434
00:24:24,418 --> 00:24:25,879
I don't want to be doing this, you know.

435
00:24:25,879 --> 00:24:29,733
Paige, it's completely understandable that you miss your old life so much that...

436
00:24:29,987 --> 00:24:31,094
I don't.

437
00:24:32,233 --> 00:24:34,768
Maybe a tiny tiny little bit.

438
00:24:35,035 --> 00:24:36,531
But not enough to make me wanna go back.

439
00:24:36,832 --> 00:24:37,517
Devinitively not.

440
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:40,223
This is just... something I have to do.

441
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,159
Ok. Then I'll help you.

442
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:48,097
No, no, no. I think the more of us are involved,
the more we risk exposure.

443
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:51,664
- I'm gonna be ok.
- Ok.

444
00:24:53,406 --> 00:24:55,674
Oh the paper called for you.

445
00:24:55,807 --> 00:24:56,607
Really?

446
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,823
What did they want?

447
00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:02,177
I think they wanted to talk to you, or, your cousin you obviously.

448
00:25:02,525 --> 00:25:03,482
I wonder what they wanted.

449
00:25:03,517 --> 00:25:06,875
I think they just want some quotes from you,
you know, that Phoebe tribune and all.

450
00:25:07,681 --> 00:25:10,315
I don't think they'll figure anything out. I think it'll be ok.

451
00:25:10,315 --> 00:25:13,482
And the bright side, you're good to see Dex again.

452
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:22,584
<i>Signs can come at any time, and from anywhere.</i>

453
00:25:22,942 --> 00:25:25,231
<i>But when you get one,
you have no choice but to follow it,</i>

454
00:25:25,648 --> 00:25:27,715
<i>even if it leads you right into danger.</i>

455
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:32,752
How could you let her get away?

456
00:25:33,345 --> 00:25:37,073
Every innocent counts, especially when one you were ultimately trying to lure.

457
00:25:37,297 --> 00:25:38,713
I didn't let her get away.

458
00:25:39,346 --> 00:25:41,868
- A witch...
- If you can't handle one louzy witch!

459
00:25:42,104 --> 00:25:43,777
It wasn't just one!

460
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:45,358
What do you mean?

461
00:25:45,358 --> 00:25:47,585
I mean, somebody else came to help.

462
00:25:49,324 --> 00:25:51,627
- An other witch?
- No, a whitelighter.

463
00:25:52,261 --> 00:25:53,117
Probably hers.

464
00:25:53,117 --> 00:25:55,794
Wasn't one of the Charmed Ones a whitelighter?

465
00:25:56,572 --> 00:25:57,147
Half.

466
00:25:58,607 --> 00:25:59,595
Why?

467
00:26:00,911 --> 00:26:04,603
Because maybe it wasn't just a whitelighter who came to help.

468
00:26:05,654 --> 00:26:07,015
Maybe it was really our sister.

469
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:08,679
That's impossible.

470
00:26:09,086 --> 00:26:11,472
- Neither of them looked anything like...
- They wouldn't.

471
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,919
They'd be in disguises.

472
00:26:16,185 --> 00:26:18,188
Magical disguises.

473
00:26:19,409 --> 00:26:22,429
- Perhaps we're closer than we think.
- What if we are?

474
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:26,491
How could we kill them when no other demon could.

475
00:26:26,492 --> 00:26:28,094
We don't try.

476
00:26:28,978 --> 00:26:29,650
We can't.

477
00:26:29,993 --> 00:26:33,375
But what we can do is taking on the same wild ride as the Elders

478
00:26:33,807 --> 00:26:36,614
with the same inevitable result.

479
00:26:37,297 --> 00:26:39,544
I give up! No use, I quit.

480
00:26:40,448 --> 00:26:43,789
Quit? Quit? Why?
What's the matter?

481
00:26:43,944 --> 00:26:44,715
Everything.

482
00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:48,795
I can't have a normal life
when I can't even have a normal day!

483
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:54,870
Not now Leo, I'm not in the mood.

484
00:26:55,231 --> 00:26:56,799
Oh come on, like that's what I want.

485
00:26:58,569 --> 00:27:01,829
Come on, just talk to me, ok?
What is it?

486
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:03,146
Nothing.

487
00:27:06,363 --> 00:27:07,191
It's just...

488
00:27:08,244 --> 00:27:09,929
It's not what I expected, that's all.

489
00:27:10,461 --> 00:27:12,767
Everytime I try to do something for myself,

490
00:27:12,767 --> 00:27:15,154
something comes along to mess it up.

491
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:19,420
And aside from all the demon fighting,
it's not that much different than it used to be.

492
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:23,918
Look I'm sorry I locked myself out of the house, ok?

493
00:27:23,918 --> 00:27:29,127
No, it's not that. It's not the point.
Just, you know what?

494
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:30,753
Forget it.

495
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:35,324
Look, this all just happened, ok?
You're starting over.

496
00:27:36,372 --> 00:27:39,531
You have to be patient.
Trust me. It's gonna take some time.

497
00:27:39,877 --> 00:27:40,481
Time?

498
00:27:41,302 --> 00:27:42,137
How much more time?

499
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,461
I just lost my twenties, how much time do you want?

500
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:45,953
What do you mean?

501
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:47,796
I mean it's just...

502
00:27:48,905 --> 00:27:53,323
It feels like I just woke up,
and I misplaced the hugest chock of my life.

503
00:27:54,345 --> 00:27:55,639
I mean, it went by so fast.

504
00:27:55,851 --> 00:27:58,790
Seven years ago, I was just fresh out of college, I was single,

505
00:27:59,121 --> 00:28:01,179
I was cooking, I was trying to become a chef,

506
00:28:01,315 --> 00:28:06,012
and then boom, suddenly, "hello, hi, you're a witch,
and by the way so is your whole family",

507
00:28:06,303 --> 00:28:10,807
and we're saving innocents, and then I'm somebody's wife,
and then I'm somebody's mother, and then I'm somebody's boss,

508
00:28:10,807 --> 00:28:12,115
and I'm somebody something.

509
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,817
And I just...

510
00:28:16,046 --> 00:28:17,599
I don't know how to start over.

511
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:20,579
I've been wo many things for so long.

512
00:28:21,357 --> 00:28:23,236
I don't know who I am anymore.

513
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:25,806
I know who you are.

514
00:28:27,898 --> 00:28:29,555
You're an amazing mum.

515
00:28:30,987 --> 00:28:32,628
And you're an amazing wife.

516
00:28:33,684 --> 00:28:35,548
And most importantly, an amazing person.

517
00:28:36,045 --> 00:28:36,873
Stop.

518
00:28:37,287 --> 00:28:38,719
No, you are.

519
00:28:38,737 --> 00:28:43,923
You can't sacrify yourself for so many people
for so many years

520
00:28:44,313 --> 00:28:45,990
and not expect a transition period.

521
00:28:47,288 --> 00:28:48,466
You have to be patient.

522
00:28:49,252 --> 00:28:50,634
And what do I do about the guilt?

523
00:28:50,947 --> 00:28:51,980
What guilt?

524
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,158
The guilt I feel when I know very bad things are happening out there

525
00:28:55,158 --> 00:28:57,370
and I'm not doing anything about it.

526
00:28:57,511 --> 00:28:59,327
Like these missing kids.

527
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:02,058
Bad things are always gonna happen, Piper.

528
00:29:03,057 --> 00:29:05,114
You know, they happened long before you became a witch,

529
00:29:05,114 --> 00:29:07,772
and they're gonna continue to happen long afterwards.

530
00:29:09,563 --> 00:29:10,753
You've paid your dues.

531
00:29:10,753 --> 00:29:13,734
You've been selfless, now it's time to be selfish.

532
00:29:15,076 --> 00:29:16,160
You deserve it.

533
00:29:17,452 --> 00:29:19,233
We all do.

534
00:29:35,325 --> 00:29:39,611
- We've got to stop meeting like this.
- Yeah, how you say?

535
00:29:39,994 --> 00:29:42,909
<i>Sometimes signs are settled, easily missed.</i>

536
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:47,465
<i>But if you're lucky enough to catch them,
they tend to send you in the right direction.</i>

537
00:29:49,963 --> 00:29:51,614
<i>On the other hand, if you miss them,</i>

538
00:29:51,948 --> 00:29:53,357
<i>they can bite you in the ass.</i>

539
00:29:53,884 --> 00:29:54,675
<i>Big time.</i>

540
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,532
You dropped something?

541
00:30:05,108 --> 00:30:06,703
Nice costum. Where did you get it?

542
00:30:06,703 --> 00:30:07,904
Sax, you like it?

543
00:30:07,904 --> 00:30:10,033
No, witches don't actually wear costums.

544
00:30:10,033 --> 00:30:13,187
Oh really?
So they cannot go out in a broomstick that she's everyday wearing?

545
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:14,266
I meant recently.

546
00:30:14,266 --> 00:30:15,580
You should be more specific.

547
00:30:15,838 --> 00:30:17,889
I'll try to remember that for next time. Thanks for the tip.

548
00:30:19,004 --> 00:30:20,114
What's your name anyway?

549
00:30:20,608 --> 00:30:21,250
What's yours?

550
00:30:22,611 --> 00:30:23,085
Jo.

551
00:30:25,871 --> 00:30:26,669
Billie.

552
00:30:27,043 --> 00:30:27,483
Well, Billie,

553
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:31,230
it seems as if we have a big problem here.

554
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:35,075
Oh yeah?
You know actually, my problem is

555
00:30:35,085 --> 00:30:37,198
that you're just killing my buzz.

556
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:42,195
"Buzz", that's what you're calling fighting demons?

557
00:30:42,195 --> 00:30:43,988
Beats the hell out of video games!

558
00:30:44,147 --> 00:30:45,680
This isn't a game, ok?

559
00:30:46,227 --> 00:30:47,870
This is real, deadly real.

560
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,992
You can't use an adverb with a noun.

561
00:30:50,445 --> 00:30:51,991
Chair!

562
00:30:57,982 --> 00:30:59,476
Ok, here is the thing.

563
00:30:59,794 --> 00:31:01,098
People are getting killed.

564
00:31:01,098 --> 00:31:04,469
So you are gonna tell me everything I want to know

565
00:31:04,554 --> 00:31:07,449
and you're gonna tell it to me now,
otherwise we're gonna go out again.

566
00:31:08,182 --> 00:31:09,047
Fine, I'm listenning.

567
00:31:09,277 --> 00:31:10,536
How long have you been a witch?

568
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:16,417
Not that long, just up to really recently,
I noticed I had these... these powers.

569
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,006
So I bought a couple of books and I figured it out.

570
00:31:19,352 --> 00:31:20,964
And you figured out how to track demons that way?

571
00:31:21,273 --> 00:31:22,038
I'm good.

572
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:23,396
Well, I am.

573
00:31:24,219 --> 00:31:25,191
Look, let me...

574
00:31:25,931 --> 00:31:26,787
May I?

575
00:31:29,503 --> 00:31:30,979
Ok, well, first,

576
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,956
I noticed that all the missing kids had Alice like names.

577
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,505
You know like Alicia, Alyson, Allister, Alex.

578
00:31:39,758 --> 00:31:40,855
This has to do with what?

579
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:41,747
Alice?

580
00:31:41,747 --> 00:31:43,348
You know, like Alice in Wonderland?

581
00:31:45,019 --> 00:31:47,724
Ok, when the victims were found,
they were saying all these weird things,

582
00:31:48,063 --> 00:31:51,236
like mad hatters, white rabbits, stone caterpillars.

583
00:31:51,237 --> 00:31:53,577
It had to be something demonic, right?
It wasn't just too cool not to be.

584
00:31:54,152 --> 00:31:57,766
No, actually demonic isn't so cool. It's kind of a bad thing.

585
00:31:57,767 --> 00:32:01,009
Ok, whatever.
Anyways. I input it all in the computer,

586
00:32:02,134 --> 00:32:03,922
I hoped the crystal act like a GPS system,

587
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,846
I started scrying for the demon, and voilà, there he was.

588
00:32:07,457 --> 00:32:10,222
Or there she was. Are most demons chicks?

589
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:12,515
No, no, not always.

590
00:32:13,003 --> 00:32:15,925
You figured this all out by yourself?

591
00:32:16,295 --> 00:32:19,966
- Yeah.
- Ok, in that case I'm gonna need you to stay put while I go dealing with this.

592
00:32:19,966 --> 00:32:21,202
Wait, what?

593
00:32:21,713 --> 00:32:23,671
You're in way over your head, Billie.
That's why yo called for my help.

594
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:25,398
I did not called for you.

595
00:32:26,376 --> 00:32:28,714
Just let me and my sisters deal with this, ok?

596
00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:31,825
Wait, what, sisters? Are they witches too?

597
00:32:33,508 --> 00:32:35,725
Just stay here. I'll be back.

598
00:32:37,014 --> 00:32:38,208
Stay!

599
00:32:52,936 --> 00:32:54,006
Hey Julie.

600
00:32:55,172 --> 00:32:57,708
Dex, hey.
What are you doing here?

601
00:32:58,312 --> 00:33:01,246
Well you know I just stop by and see how things went with the tribune.

602
00:33:02,244 --> 00:33:04,886
- Actually it has nothing to do with the tribune.
- No?

603
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,341
No. Apparently the newspaper is having a hard time getting the advice column out

604
00:33:10,768 --> 00:33:12,681
- ever since, you know.
- Yeah.

605
00:33:13,071 --> 00:33:14,777
So they asked me to help out a little bit,

606
00:33:15,071 --> 00:33:19,332
which I thought was kind of weird, but I said sure.
Because I'm here and I'm not doing anything.

607
00:33:20,139 --> 00:33:21,924
You look like you're enjoying yourself.

608
00:33:23,618 --> 00:33:29,351
Oh, hey, get this to copy right away
and make sure that "weird and warmer creek" is before "abandonned Boston"

609
00:33:29,654 --> 00:33:31,835
because it just flows better, ok? Thanks.

610
00:33:34,904 --> 00:33:35,597
Dead lines.

611
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:38,152
I wonder what made them ask you of all people?

612
00:33:38,728 --> 00:33:39,663
I don't know.

613
00:33:40,211 --> 00:33:42,543
They said something about who being...

614
00:33:42,543 --> 00:33:44,235
Might run in the family?

615
00:33:45,492 --> 00:33:47,990
Yes, that's exactly what they said.

616
00:33:49,911 --> 00:33:52,193
Wait a minute. Did you have...

617
00:33:52,193 --> 00:33:55,000
I ran into here after the elevator, I told her I thought,

618
00:33:55,468 --> 00:33:56,900
you might be able to help.

619
00:33:58,456 --> 00:34:00,342
Anything better than the crap they've been printing, right?

620
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:03,660
Yeah. Thanks, I think.

621
00:34:04,756 --> 00:34:06,858
Look, I was just trying to protect your cousin's column.

622
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:08,629
I was her biggest fan.

623
00:34:09,997 --> 00:34:10,773
I can see that.

624
00:34:12,615 --> 00:34:14,617
It's too bad you've never got to know her.

625
00:34:16,285 --> 00:34:20,442
Well, maybe you can catch me above at diner?

626
00:34:22,136 --> 00:34:25,619
<i>A fourth victim, Alex Robbins,18, had just been discovered,</i>

627
00:34:25,874 --> 00:34:28,990
<i>walking down in the middle of Market Street, without any sense of who she was</i>

628
00:34:29,336 --> 00:34:30,574
<i>or what she was doing.</i>

629
00:34:30,941 --> 00:34:34,521
<i>Witnesses say that like the others she was found mumbling incoherently.</i>

630
00:34:34,868 --> 00:34:38,494
<i>In this case, about a path that leads no where and smiles without faces.</i>

631
00:34:38,787 --> 00:34:39,872
"Smiles without faces..."

632
00:34:40,609 --> 00:34:42,213
What the hell is going on out there.

633
00:34:43,451 --> 00:34:44,780
I have to go now.

634
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,646
- What?
- I'll call you. I'm sorry.

635
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:55,059
The teens are being lured by a fairy tale.

636
00:34:55,492 --> 00:34:57,510
Yeah, Alice in Wonderland. We know.

637
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,815
What do you mean you know?

638
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:00,510
- Billie.
- Billie?

639
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,404
Who is Billie?

640
00:35:01,404 --> 00:35:02,581
Paige's new charge.

641
00:35:02,581 --> 00:35:05,832
What I don't understand is why Alice in Wonderland?
Why did the demon pick that one?

642
00:35:05,832 --> 00:35:08,868
Are you kidding?
It's all about the loss of innocence,

643
00:35:09,272 --> 00:35:12,447
the need for escape,
the search for one's identity.

644
00:35:12,964 --> 00:35:15,856
Well if that's the case, I'm surprised they didn't lure us too.

645
00:35:15,856 --> 00:35:17,054
Maybe it was meant to.

646
00:35:17,501 --> 00:35:19,601
What else a demon would go through all that trouble,

647
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,615
what, just to mess up a couple of kids?

648
00:35:21,977 --> 00:35:22,552
Possibly.

649
00:35:22,898 --> 00:35:25,148
I think these signs are too elaborate not to be meant for us.

650
00:35:25,148 --> 00:35:26,005
And Billie.

651
00:35:26,408 --> 00:35:28,163
No, I don't think it was meant for her.

652
00:35:28,438 --> 00:35:29,288
I think she just found it.

653
00:35:29,288 --> 00:35:31,143
Which makes her one smart witch.

654
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:33,586
Yeah, maybe too smart for our own good I think.

655
00:35:33,586 --> 00:35:35,073
Do you think it is a trap?

656
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:36,230
It could be.

657
00:35:36,663 --> 00:35:39,368
Ok, then what do we do?
I mean we can't go after the demon.

658
00:35:39,745 --> 00:35:42,121
If we don't do anything, more innocents will be hurt.

659
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:43,766
Innocents are always gonna get hurt.

660
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:47,172
I know Leo, but it's a little bit different,
when we're aware of it.

661
00:35:47,626 --> 00:35:49,548
I don't think this is something we can ignore.

662
00:35:51,878 --> 00:35:53,024
So how do we find them?

663
00:35:53,266 --> 00:35:54,159
Billie knows how.

664
00:35:54,254 --> 00:35:56,844
I'll go get her scrying stuff
and you stay and make a potion, ok?

665
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:58,338
What if she figures this out?

666
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:02,134
I don't think she's gonna figure this out
because to her, it is all just a lovely little game.

667
00:36:02,134 --> 00:36:04,997
Yeah well it's one we'd better win.

668
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,331
We've been waiting for you.

669
00:36:24,957 --> 00:36:26,130
Oh, I'm curious.

670
00:36:26,649 --> 00:36:27,655
Which one are you?

671
00:36:27,812 --> 00:36:28,407
Phoebe?

672
00:36:28,982 --> 00:36:29,616
Piper?

673
00:36:30,035 --> 00:36:30,841
Paige?

674
00:36:30,876 --> 00:36:33,408
I think you have me confuse with somebody else.

675
00:36:33,688 --> 00:36:35,134
I think not.

676
00:36:36,616 --> 00:36:37,414
Send her through.

677
00:36:37,861 --> 00:36:41,625
Then after the sisters find her lying in the street and
come looking for revenge,

678
00:36:42,169 --> 00:36:44,574
we will send them through too.

679
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:52,064
Where is Billie?

680
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:56,362
In big trouble.
She decided to go after the demon by herself.

681
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,230
- What?
- A way to find her?

682
00:36:59,353 --> 00:37:00,171
I think so.

683
00:37:00,445 --> 00:37:03,694
I took this from her computer showing me how she scryied.

684
00:37:03,694 --> 00:37:05,814
She was scrying with a computer?

685
00:37:05,814 --> 00:37:07,267
Pretty style there.

686
00:37:07,743 --> 00:37:10,313
Right. Or it just might get her killed faster.

687
00:37:12,322 --> 00:37:12,854
I got her.

688
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:15,767
Hang on a second, wait one second.

689
00:37:16,285 --> 00:37:18,300
What if Billie doesn't need saving.

690
00:37:18,764 --> 00:37:19,431
What?

691
00:37:19,431 --> 00:37:21,317
Do you have any idea what she's talking about?

692
00:37:21,317 --> 00:37:24,735
I'm talking about what if Billie is part of the trap.

693
00:37:25,132 --> 00:37:26,347
That is absurd.

694
00:37:26,787 --> 00:37:27,441
Is it?

695
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:30,299
Think about it.
Either she's as smart as you think she is,

696
00:37:30,616 --> 00:37:33,163
and she figured all of it out by herself, or

697
00:37:33,487 --> 00:37:34,754
she's working with the demons.

698
00:37:35,113 --> 00:37:35,934
Oh please.

699
00:37:36,444 --> 00:37:38,439
Come on Paige, how well do you really know her?

700
00:37:38,935 --> 00:37:41,324
She could have planted all of the signs.

701
00:38:09,608 --> 00:38:10,550
Help!

702
00:38:10,662 --> 00:38:12,100
Kill her! I said kill her!

703
00:38:12,371 --> 00:38:15,827
Cut her, right now, on with her head!

704
00:38:17,075 --> 00:38:18,249
Run for your life!

705
00:38:24,972 --> 00:38:26,987
What is happenning to me?

706
00:38:28,138 --> 00:38:30,095
"I'll be the judge and the jury."

707
00:38:30,317 --> 00:38:31,967
said the cunning old Fury...

708
00:38:32,085 --> 00:38:35,447
And I'll trial the whole case,
then condemn you to death.

709
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,297
- Billie are you in there?
- Yeah.

710
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:54,930
What have you done?

711
00:38:55,513 --> 00:38:56,593
How did you do this?

712
00:38:57,211 --> 00:38:58,225
You killed her.

713
00:38:58,802 --> 00:39:01,436
Brightside, at least you got to meet us first.

714
00:39:01,436 --> 00:39:03,372
I should never have underestimated you.

715
00:39:04,156 --> 00:39:05,509
I knew you're alive.

716
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,545
Too bad, you won't be around long enough to tell anybody.

717
00:39:20,827 --> 00:39:21,247
Waouh!

718
00:39:21,569 --> 00:39:22,423
You're welcome.

719
00:39:22,792 --> 00:39:25,687
I can't believe this.
You guys really are the Charmed Ones?

720
00:39:27,937 --> 00:39:30,053
I did a little research after you left.

721
00:39:30,467 --> 00:39:32,978
The newspapers said you all died in a terrible accident.

722
00:39:34,496 --> 00:39:35,458
And which one are you?

723
00:39:40,116 --> 00:39:41,454
I would be Paige.

724
00:39:41,577 --> 00:39:42,778
What do we do?

725
00:39:42,778 --> 00:39:44,257
Blow her up.

726
00:39:44,387 --> 00:39:46,387
What? Do you have any better ideas?

727
00:39:46,672 --> 00:39:48,738
I'm not gonna tell anyone if that what you think. I promise.

728
00:39:49,029 --> 00:39:49,779
What's the catch?

729
00:39:51,374 --> 00:39:52,045
Well, show me the ropes,

730
00:39:52,527 --> 00:39:54,749
teach me everything you know about witchcraft.

731
00:39:55,002 --> 00:39:55,495
Everything.

732
00:39:55,999 --> 00:39:57,761
- Forget it.
- Wait a second.

733
00:39:59,015 --> 00:39:59,962
What do you have to offer?

734
00:40:00,947 --> 00:40:03,690
I can help you guys fight the demons.
You don't have to do it all the time.

735
00:40:03,914 --> 00:40:06,534
I mean, I assume that is why you faked your own deaths, right?

736
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:09,870
You're right. She is too smart for our own good.

737
00:40:10,727 --> 00:40:11,153
Alright.

738
00:40:11,494 --> 00:40:12,518
One condition.

739
00:40:13,822 --> 00:40:15,485
Lose the cheap leather outfit.

740
00:40:19,303 --> 00:40:20,064
Sorry.

741
00:40:24,414 --> 00:40:26,721
<i>It's funny sometimes where signs lead you.</i>

742
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:30,779
<i>Rarely where you thought you'd go,</i>

743
00:40:31,926 --> 00:40:33,914
<i>but always where you belong.</i>

744
00:40:37,413 --> 00:40:41,505
<i>In Paige's case, she realized that being a cop wasn't her cup of tea,</i>

745
00:40:42,171 --> 00:40:44,125
<i>being with a certain cop was.</i>

746
00:40:46,123 --> 00:40:50,938
<i>For Piper, the only sign she really needed was the one that reminded her she wasn't alone.</i>

747
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:09,466
<i>As for me, I discovered that, just like Alice,</i>

748
00:41:09,466 --> 00:41:11,123
<i>no matter how wild the ride,</i>

749
00:41:11,123 --> 00:41:15,315
<i>signs will sometimes lead you right back to where you started from.</i>

750
00:41:16,536 --> 00:41:17,214
<i>Changed,</i>

751
00:41:18,014 --> 00:41:18,624
<i>different,</i>

752
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,031
<i>but home.</i>

753
00:41:38,088 --> 00:41:42,270
<i>And they lived happily ever after....</i>
