00:00:00,047 --> 00:00:02,294
<i>Previously on "Pushing Daisies"...</i>

2
00:00:02,512 --> 00:00:04,796
<i>Young Ned had a special gift.</i>

3
00:00:04,978 --> 00:00:08,091
<i>He could touch dead things
and bring them back to life.</i>

4
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:09,595
<i>But he could only bring</i>

5
00:00:09,675 --> 00:00:11,802
<i>the dead back to life
for one minute.</i>

6
00:00:11,882 --> 00:00:14,232
<i>Any longer,
and someone else had to die.</i>

7
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,562
<i>And there was one more
thing he had to learn --</i>

8
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:18,101
<i>First touch, life.</i>

9
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,979
<i>Second touch, dead again forever.</i>

10
00:00:21,277 --> 00:00:23,180
<i>But as young Ned grew
into the pie maker,</i>

11
00:00:23,261 --> 00:00:26,156
<i>this gift proved to be most
useful in the untimely death</i>

12
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:28,205
<i>of his childhood sweetheart,
Charlotte Charles.</i>

13
00:00:28,286 --> 00:00:29,697
Are you in love with her?

14
00:00:29,819 --> 00:00:31,350
- You only got a minute.
- I know.

15
00:00:31,438 --> 00:00:32,702
- 60 seconds.
- I know.

16
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:34,412
What if you didn't have to be dead?

17
00:00:34,498 --> 00:00:35,572
You can't touch me.

18
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,232
So a kiss is out of the question?

19
00:00:37,315 --> 00:00:39,343
You touch murder victims,
you ask who killed them.

20
00:00:39,427 --> 00:00:41,483
You touch them again,
they go back to being dead,

21
00:00:41,566 --> 00:00:44,161
- and then you collect the reward?
- That's it in a nutshell.

22
00:00:44,246 --> 00:00:46,472
Today is my daddy's birthday.

23
00:00:46,586 --> 00:00:48,462
Do you know he would
have been 60 today

24
00:00:48,546 --> 00:00:49,842
if he were still alive?

25
00:00:49,927 --> 00:00:51,723
It's my fault Chuck's
father's dead.

26
00:00:51,845 --> 00:00:53,673
- I should just tell her.
- Don't tell her.

27
00:00:53,757 --> 00:00:55,533
I can't keep lying to her.

28
00:00:55,727 --> 00:00:57,431
- Chuck.
- Mm-hmm?

29
00:00:57,648 --> 00:00:59,100
I killed your dad.

For www.forom.com

31
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,902
<i>It was like any day
in Play-Doh village,</i>

32
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:12,321
<i>except today death came.</i>

33
00:01:12,908 --> 00:01:15,402
<i>Young Ned enjoyed
bringing Play-Doh death</i>

34
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,110
<i>to Play-Doh people.</i>

35
00:01:17,207 --> 00:01:19,241
<i>He did not yet realize
he could bring</i>

36
00:01:19,326 --> 00:01:21,702
<i>real death to real people.</i>

37
00:01:22,796 --> 00:01:25,330
<i>Young Chuck was 8 years, 42 weeks,</i>

38
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:27,292
<i>3 hours, and 2 minutes old</i>

39
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:29,840
<i>and about to become an orphan.</i>

40
00:01:30,178 --> 00:01:31,860
<i>Her father washed off the grit</i>

41
00:01:31,945 --> 00:01:34,133
<i>from a hard day
conquering villages.</i>

42
00:01:34,247 --> 00:01:36,721
<i>He wasn't just a star in her life.</i>

43
00:01:37,228 --> 00:01:40,850
<i>He was a pocket universe
full of stars.</i>

44
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:50,230
<i>Ned and his mother waited
with Chuck for her aunts</i>

45
00:01:50,356 --> 00:01:52,652
<i>Lily and Vivian to arrive.</i>

46
00:01:52,787 --> 00:01:55,573
<i>Chuck would later remember
Ned being very quiet,</i>

47
00:01:55,695 --> 00:01:58,742
<i>staring at his mother as
if staring at a ghost.</i>

48
00:01:58,898 --> 00:02:01,700
<i>Only Ned knew his mother
had already been dead</i>

49
00:02:01,845 --> 00:02:04,782
<i>- once that day.
- There but for the grace of god.</i>

50
00:02:04,906 --> 00:02:07,402
<i>Only Ned knew that he had
touched her back to life</i>

51
00:02:07,485 --> 00:02:10,791
<i>and, one minute later,
Chuck's father died.</i>

52
00:02:10,876 --> 00:02:14,053
<i>It had seemed to Ned a
strange coincidence,</i>

53
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:16,592
<i>a strange, troubling coincidence.</i>

54
00:02:16,698 --> 00:02:20,801
<i>Chuck would remember
Ned didn't look at her.</i>

55
00:02:22,187 --> 00:02:24,261
<i>She would remember Vivian,</i>

56
00:02:24,366 --> 00:02:26,292
<i>who didn't like to touch anyone,</i>

57
00:02:26,377 --> 00:02:28,191
<i>was the first to embrace her,</i>

58
00:02:28,296 --> 00:02:30,041
<i>and she would remember Lily,</i>

59
00:02:30,138 --> 00:02:32,061
<i>who had no problem
with touch at all,</i>

60
00:02:32,147 --> 00:02:36,070
<i>couldn't bring herself within reach,
not right away.</i>

61
00:02:36,168 --> 00:02:37,572
<i>Later that night,</i>

62
00:02:37,695 --> 00:02:39,992
<i>Chuck would remember Ned
ringing the doorbell</i>

63
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:42,782
<i>just after bedtime and
Lily telling her...</i>

64
00:02:43,035 --> 00:02:44,330
Something happened.

65
00:02:44,496 --> 00:02:47,330
- Another something happened?
- His mother died.

66
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:51,213
<i>It wasn't until Lily
hugged young Ned</i>

67
00:02:51,376 --> 00:02:53,711
<i>after learning of
his mother's passing</i>

68
00:02:53,858 --> 00:02:56,262
<i>that she took Chuck in her arms.</i>

69
00:03:05,765 --> 00:03:08,770
<i>It was no less difficult
for Chuck to let go of Ned</i>

70
00:03:08,907 --> 00:03:11,810
<i>when his father whisked
him away to be abandoned</i>

71
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:14,482
<i>at the Longborough School for boys.</i>

72
00:03:17,487 --> 00:03:18,481
Ned!

73
00:03:19,288 --> 00:03:20,283
Ned!!

74
00:03:23,628 --> 00:03:26,242
<i>Chuck would never see him again,</i>

75
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:29,162
<i>not for as long as she lived.</i>

76
00:03:29,307 --> 00:03:30,662
Ned...

77
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:32,041
Chuck!

78
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,212
<i>It's 20 years, 2 months, 3 weeks,</i>

79
00:03:35,377 --> 00:03:38,341
<i>2 days, 5 hours,
and 54 minutes later,</i>

80
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,920
<i>- but this winter...
- Chuck!</i>

81
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,623
<i> ...There's an unpleasant
chill in the air.</i>

82
00:03:51,777 --> 00:03:53,850
<i>After learning her father died</i>

83
00:03:54,018 --> 00:03:56,730
<i>because the pie maker brought
his mother back to life,</i>

84
00:03:56,817 --> 00:03:58,903
<i>Chuck disappeared into the night.</i>

85
00:03:59,046 --> 00:04:00,442
Chuck!

86
00:04:04,417 --> 00:04:05,451
Chuck!

87
00:04:08,338 --> 00:04:09,203
Chuck!

88
00:04:13,177 --> 00:04:14,000
Chuck!

89
00:04:16,045 --> 00:04:16,752
Chuck!

90
00:04:20,015 --> 00:04:21,093
Chuck!

91
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,842
Stop squawking, you twit!

92
00:04:26,357 --> 00:04:29,302
<i>The pie maker considered
the places to find Chuck...</i>

93
00:04:29,688 --> 00:04:33,982
<i>...The places she'd run,
the places she called home.</i>

94
00:04:39,825 --> 00:04:41,280
Who is it?

95
00:04:41,618 --> 00:04:43,740
It's, uh, Ned, the, uh, pie maker.

96
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:48,200
All this fuss about global warming.

97
00:04:48,587 --> 00:04:50,503
Can't happen soon enough,
if you ask me.

98
00:04:50,587 --> 00:04:51,913
Why is it so cold in here?

99
00:04:52,298 --> 00:04:54,093
Charlotte used to
light the furnace.

100
00:04:54,218 --> 00:04:56,132
The thought of outliving
her seemed so unlikely,

101
00:04:56,218 --> 00:04:58,050
we never bothered to
learn how to do it.

102
00:04:58,137 --> 00:05:00,012
So it hasn't mysteriously
lit itself, because,

103
00:05:00,096 --> 00:05:01,762
- clearly, it's very cold.
- Clearly.

104
00:05:01,845 --> 00:05:03,012
Wouldn't it be lovely

105
00:05:03,138 --> 00:05:05,682
if Charlotte's ghost returned
to light the furnace?

106
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:07,712
Would you like me to
light the furnace?

107
00:05:09,188 --> 00:05:10,980
On the subject of
Charlotte's ghost,

108
00:05:11,088 --> 00:05:13,310
if you sense her
presence in any way --

109
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:14,953
When you say "presence..."

110
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:17,270
If you think you see her out
of the corner of your eye

111
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:18,902
or hear strange noises in your room

112
00:05:18,988 --> 00:05:20,942
or find suspicious
footprints in the snow...

113
00:05:21,027 --> 00:05:22,990
Should we be expecting
this presence?

114
00:05:23,077 --> 00:05:25,201
Because you're being kind
of urgent over there.

115
00:05:25,287 --> 00:05:26,531
Oh, god, no.

116
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,161
I'm just, uh, thawing,

117
00:05:28,285 --> 00:05:30,500
but if you were to see her
or think you see her...

118
00:05:30,588 --> 00:05:33,081
I saw Charlotte once
after she died.

119
00:05:33,508 --> 00:05:35,503
Then I blinked, and she's gone.

120
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:37,961
It was... unpleasant,

121
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:40,212
that trick my mind played on me.

122
00:05:40,378 --> 00:05:43,010
And it's unpleasant of you
to come here picking scabs

123
00:05:43,097 --> 00:05:44,513
in the middle of the night.

124
00:05:44,768 --> 00:05:46,131
I didn't mean to pick.

125
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:48,103
Thank you very much for
lighting our furnace

126
00:05:48,187 --> 00:05:49,970
so Charlotte's ghost
wouldn't have to.

127
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,890
- Am I leaving?
- Yes.

128
00:05:59,195 --> 00:06:01,900
Hiya. Did you come by to get Digby?

129
00:06:02,115 --> 00:06:03,733
No. Have you seen Chuck?

130
00:06:04,115 --> 00:06:06,613
Not since the chorus of
slamming doors last night

131
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,371
that woke me from a dead sleep.

132
00:06:08,457 --> 00:06:09,701
Did we get loud?

133
00:06:09,996 --> 00:06:11,740
You were very loud.

134
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,290
After all the commotion,

135
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:17,201
I peeped my peeper
out the peephole,

136
00:06:17,286 --> 00:06:19,743
saw her getting on the elevator
and you taking the stairs.

137
00:06:19,828 --> 00:06:21,300
I take it you didn't catch her?

138
00:06:21,388 --> 00:06:23,982
The elevator's fast,
and those stairs were slippery.

139
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:26,472
I also heard you
walking the streets,

140
00:06:26,728 --> 00:06:29,130
moaning her name like something
out of a Tennessee Williams.

141
00:06:29,217 --> 00:06:31,601
It may be romantic,
but it's not dignified.

142
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:33,433
I don't know where she is, Olive.

143
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:35,430
Maybe she doesn't want you to know.

144
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:38,026
Now go clean yourself up.
You look like crap.

145
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,945
<i>It was hard for Olive
Snook to close the door</i>

146
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:43,367
<i>on the pie maker's breaking heart.</i>

147
00:06:56,419 --> 00:06:58,461
Are you gonna tell me what he did?

148
00:06:58,616 --> 00:07:00,040
- Did he beat you?
- No.

149
00:07:00,188 --> 00:07:02,130
Did he look like he
wanted to beat you?

150
00:07:02,257 --> 00:07:03,752
Is it over, you and him?

151
00:07:03,878 --> 00:07:05,632
No, I don't know.
I'm just digesting.

152
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,843
Well, I guess you can stay
here till you've passed

153
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,422
whatever it is you're digesting.

154
00:07:09,505 --> 00:07:11,562
Thank you,
and please don't tell him where I am.

155
00:07:11,645 --> 00:07:14,263
Hey, Digby. Did you shave his bum?

156
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,760
No, he must have got it
caught in the vacuum.

157
00:07:16,898 --> 00:07:19,273
Did the vacuum take
a bite out of you?

158
00:07:20,105 --> 00:07:22,313
Look, I know this is
none of my business,

159
00:07:22,455 --> 00:07:24,720
but I have so many questions
tugging at my tongue

160
00:07:24,805 --> 00:07:26,571
as to why you faked your death,

161
00:07:26,695 --> 00:07:28,293
and I've just felt like I needed

162
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,060
to respect your
privacy on this issue.

163
00:07:30,148 --> 00:07:31,200
I appreciate that.

164
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,410
But I am not gonna respect
your privacy right now.

165
00:07:33,497 --> 00:07:35,983
Why did you fake your death?
Is this an insurance scam?

166
00:07:36,065 --> 00:07:38,523
Are you and the pie maker in
some kind of cahoots together?

167
00:07:38,605 --> 00:07:39,820
I died.

168
00:07:39,928 --> 00:07:42,370
And he brought me back to life.

169
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,711
Cahoots enough for you?

170
00:07:45,046 --> 00:07:47,250
If you don't want to tell me,
just say so.

171
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:49,760
I was just curious if you were
fighting over the cahoots

172
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:53,013
or something more... personal.

173
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,931
More personal than cahoots-related.

174
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:57,253
Can we go back to the
"Respecting my privacy" thing?

175
00:07:57,338 --> 00:07:59,671
Yeah, sure.
I'm going to your aunts' later.

176
00:07:59,825 --> 00:08:02,642
Now that you're avoiding Ned,
I guess you won't be making them a pie.

177
00:08:02,726 --> 00:08:06,072
- You want me to grab one off the rack?
- Would you mind making it from scratch?

178
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:08,923
- They like it a certain way.
- Whatever way you've been making them

179
00:08:09,007 --> 00:08:10,911
is doing the trick.
The mermaids are swimming.

180
00:08:10,995 --> 00:08:12,990
- They're back in the water?
- Vivian told me.

181
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,063
Lily doesn't want me to know.
Thinks I'll gloat.

182
00:08:15,148 --> 00:08:18,643
So I'm pretending not to. I'm pretending
not to know a lot these days.

183
00:08:19,507 --> 00:08:22,051
Pear with gruyère
baked into the crust?

184
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,171
Mm-hmm, and I add extra vanilla.

185
00:08:24,325 --> 00:08:25,961
It's my secret ingredient.

186
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:27,502
Lily loves vanilla.

187
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:28,842
You got it.

188
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,340
<i>But Chuck's secret
ingredient wasn't vanilla.</i>

189
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,592
<i>It was an herbal mood enhancer.</i>

190
00:08:33,786 --> 00:08:37,103
<i>Olive Snook had been delivering
enhanced pies for weeks,</i>

191
00:08:37,235 --> 00:08:41,353
<i>not realizing she was a
homeopathic-drug mule.</i>

192
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:44,393
Not very strong vanilla.

193
00:09:00,837 --> 00:09:02,580
I told her I killed her father.

194
00:09:04,717 --> 00:09:06,792
She asked you if
you killed her dad?

195
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,180
Did she ask you that?

196
00:09:08,336 --> 00:09:10,100
Did them words come
out of her mouth?

197
00:09:10,188 --> 00:09:11,940
No. We were talking
about phantom limbs,

198
00:09:12,026 --> 00:09:13,983
and I blurted it out.
It was like word vomit.

199
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:16,300
Then you slipped in that word
vomit and fell on you ass,

200
00:09:16,387 --> 00:09:18,010
and now you're
covered in word vomit.

201
00:09:18,096 --> 00:09:19,982
Dead girl could be out
there all grudgy grudge

202
00:09:20,065 --> 00:09:21,250
with a beef to pick.

203
00:09:21,356 --> 00:09:22,561
"Hello, evening news.

204
00:09:22,686 --> 00:09:24,440
I'm lonely tourist
Charlotte Charles.

205
00:09:24,528 --> 00:09:26,521
I just crawled out of my grave,
and here's how."

206
00:09:26,606 --> 00:09:28,810
Stop it.
I'm having difficulty breathing.

207
00:09:28,977 --> 00:09:31,283
- What kind of state is she in?
- A bad state.

208
00:09:31,406 --> 00:09:32,650
She just up and left,

209
00:09:32,785 --> 00:09:35,181
and now she's all alone in the cold,
cold world.

210
00:09:35,286 --> 00:09:37,702
Sound like she want to be out
alone in the cold, cold world,

211
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,410
so don't go tracking her down,

212
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,121
reminding her why she's mad at you.

213
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:43,172
Then she really will go
to the evening news.

214
00:09:43,255 --> 00:09:44,412
That's what I said,

215
00:09:44,588 --> 00:09:47,381
except for the evening-news part,
which I don't understand.

216
00:09:47,465 --> 00:09:49,310
We're talking about Chuck,
aren't we?

217
00:09:49,508 --> 00:09:51,671
We're talking about Chuck--
me and him.

218
00:09:51,795 --> 00:09:53,801
I don't know what the
hell you talking about

219
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:55,542
'cause this don't concern you.

220
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:04,353
Dead girl's got to work out
whatever she needs to work out,

221
00:10:04,475 --> 00:10:06,943
but you can't go dropping
the "I killed your dad" bomb

222
00:10:07,026 --> 00:10:08,440
and expect happy golightly.

223
00:10:08,568 --> 00:10:10,321
I've got a "Here's
what you should do."

224
00:10:10,405 --> 00:10:12,530
Leave her be,
and while you leaving her be,

225
00:10:12,616 --> 00:10:14,360
there's somebody I
need you to talk to.

226
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,890
<i>The facts were these--</i>

227
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,282
<i>an adjuster for uber-life
life insurance,</i>

228
00:10:18,365 --> 00:10:21,240
<i>one Victor Narramore,
was 46 years, 11 weeks,</i>

229
00:10:21,397 --> 00:10:24,160
<i>5 days, 17 hours, and 3 minutes old</i>

230
00:10:24,325 --> 00:10:26,910
<i>when his body was
scooped up by a snowplow</i>

231
00:10:27,045 --> 00:10:29,371
<i>on the 200 block of oak street.</i>

232
00:10:29,517 --> 00:10:32,250
<i>Unsettled by this particular
new year's tiding,</i>

233
00:10:32,388 --> 00:10:34,553
<i>oak street homeowners association</i>

234
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:37,881
<i>offered a reward to find
Victor Narramore's killer.</i>

235
00:10:38,045 --> 00:10:40,361
Anybody ever ask you why
you wear that sweater?

236
00:10:40,448 --> 00:10:42,591
My niece gave me this
sweater last Christmas.

237
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,770
That thing's uglier
than a chipmunk's ass.

238
00:10:45,068 --> 00:10:46,980
He means the sweater,
not your niece.

239
00:10:47,065 --> 00:10:48,731
Why would somebody give somebody

240
00:10:48,876 --> 00:10:50,543
a Christmas sweater for Christmas?

241
00:10:50,628 --> 00:10:52,123
You can only wear it that day.

242
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,100
He means should only
wear it that day.

243
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:57,151
Either you got to take off
what you got on to put it on

244
00:10:57,275 --> 00:10:59,710
or you got to wait another year
for the next holiday season.

245
00:10:59,797 --> 00:11:01,992
Why are you going toe-to-toe
with me on fashion?

246
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,371
Only thing I want to hear
from your peeper is,

247
00:11:04,457 --> 00:11:07,833
"Happy holidays," and,
"Here's your rent."

248
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:10,863
- Happy holidays!
- Here's your rent.

249
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:14,132
Feels light.

250
00:11:14,848 --> 00:11:17,321
You just stronger than you think.

251
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,640
- I can't move.
- You're frozen solid.

252
00:11:29,237 --> 00:11:32,193
So there is such a thing as
a snowball's chance in hell.

253
00:11:32,318 --> 00:11:34,321
You're not in hell, Mr.
Narramore. Should you be?

254
00:11:34,405 --> 00:11:36,483
Oh, no. No, no, no, of course not.

255
00:11:36,785 --> 00:11:39,362
Well, it really depends
on who you're talking to.

256
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,493
- Who am I talking to?
- Angels of justice.

257
00:11:42,878 --> 00:11:44,991
Oh, then I am in hell, aren't I?

258
00:11:45,126 --> 00:11:46,873
Who killed you, Mr. Narramore?

259
00:11:46,996 --> 00:11:48,413
I don't know who killed me,

260
00:11:48,545 --> 00:11:50,460
but I do know how they killed me.

261
00:11:50,698 --> 00:11:52,403
<i>After a long day at the office,</i>

262
00:11:52,488 --> 00:11:54,710
<i>Victor Narramore was
walking to his car</i>

263
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,840
<i>when he heard someone
approaching rapidly from behind.</i>

264
00:11:57,955 --> 00:12:00,723
<i>Victor Narramore didn't
see who killed him,</i>

265
00:12:00,828 --> 00:12:03,553
<i>but he did see how he was killed,</i>

266
00:12:03,678 --> 00:12:07,102
<i>and he was, in fact,
killed with kindness.</i>

267
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,061
You were killed with kindness?

268
00:12:10,315 --> 00:12:11,693
Not the sentiment,

269
00:12:11,808 --> 00:12:13,353
which would have been lovely,

270
00:12:13,496 --> 00:12:15,022
but the word,

271
00:12:15,365 --> 00:12:18,071
which was scratched into the
business end of a baseball bat.

272
00:12:18,158 --> 00:12:20,072
Somewhere between
kindness and the morgue,

273
00:12:20,158 --> 00:12:21,822
somebody turned you
into a corpsicle,

274
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,740
and you got scooped
up by a snowplow.

275
00:12:23,828 --> 00:12:25,870
No idea why somebody who
would want to kill you?

276
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:28,161
Well, I am an insurance adjuster.

277
00:12:28,296 --> 00:12:30,211
We're more hated than
parking enforcement.

278
00:12:30,295 --> 00:12:31,542
How come?

279
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,560
It's my job to quantify
people's lives

280
00:12:33,647 --> 00:12:35,551
and decide if they
deserve a new organ.

281
00:12:35,635 --> 00:12:38,183
No one wants to be told if
they should live or die.

282
00:12:38,387 --> 00:12:40,130
- Do I get to live now?
- No.

283
00:12:40,687 --> 00:12:42,723
Now I got to make a list of people

284
00:12:43,016 --> 00:12:44,380
who wanted to get an organ

285
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,683
but were turned down
by Victor Narramore.

286
00:12:46,805 --> 00:12:49,141
<i>But the pie maker didn't
care about Victor Narramore</i>

287
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:51,023
<i>and his unattainable organs.</i>

288
00:12:51,156 --> 00:12:53,350
<i>He only cared about Chuck,
out there,</i>

289
00:12:53,438 --> 00:12:56,190
<i>alone in the cold, cold world.</i>

290
00:13:01,905 --> 00:13:06,663
<i>But what he didn't know was
that she wasn't alone at all.</i>

291
00:13:06,915 --> 00:13:07,913
Ned?

292
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,791
Not Ned.

293
00:13:17,887 --> 00:13:20,501
In winter,
everything is dampened and hushed--

294
00:13:20,847 --> 00:13:23,053
sounds and smells-- but not you,

295
00:13:23,205 --> 00:13:25,473
girl who smells like
honey and death.

296
00:13:26,935 --> 00:13:28,351
Hello, Oscar.

297
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,640
I hope your bees are
surviving the chill.

298
00:13:30,765 --> 00:13:32,603
- Seem to be.
- That explains the honey

299
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,142
but not the death.

300
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,230
I'm cold.

301
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,021
I'm going in.

302
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,692
Thank you.

303
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:41,943
- This will keep you warm.
- My sweater.

304
00:13:42,067 --> 00:13:44,183
It's clean,
if that's what you're worrying about.

305
00:13:44,266 --> 00:13:45,752
In fact, it's very clean.

306
00:13:45,865 --> 00:13:47,321
I collected every last bit of

307
00:13:47,445 --> 00:13:49,072
anything that wasn't cashmere,

308
00:13:49,205 --> 00:13:50,992
even a little sample of your hair.

309
00:13:51,128 --> 00:13:53,333
All right,
this is making me very uncomfortable.

310
00:13:53,418 --> 00:13:55,791
you mean up on a rooftop
with a near stranger

311
00:13:55,928 --> 00:13:57,801
who's waxing on about
collecting your hair?

312
00:13:57,885 --> 00:13:58,721
Yes.

313
00:13:59,925 --> 00:14:02,341
Wait, did you shave Digby's bum?

314
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:03,990
What is with you and that dog?

315
00:14:04,146 --> 00:14:06,012
You both have the same scent.

316
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:07,731
You did shave Digby's bum.

317
00:14:07,855 --> 00:14:09,600
Which reminds me,

318
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,431
could I please have a
larger sample of your hair?

319
00:14:13,576 --> 00:14:15,320
Why? What are you gonna do with it?

320
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,972
Stuff it in my pillow.

321
00:14:17,277 --> 00:14:19,561
Human hair is much
softer than down.

322
00:14:19,905 --> 00:14:21,442
I'm teasing you.

323
00:14:22,118 --> 00:14:23,610
I'm just curious--

324
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:29,783
Why you and that dog
aren't like anyone else.

325
00:14:33,995 --> 00:14:37,291
Hair can be so telling
about so many things.

326
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:40,501
Unless you already know

327
00:14:40,688 --> 00:14:42,753
what the hair knows
and want to tell me.

328
00:14:42,887 --> 00:14:44,882
My hair doesn't know anything.
Maybe it's you.

329
00:14:44,965 --> 00:14:46,800
People smell strange
smells all the time.

330
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:48,221
They don't even exist.

331
00:14:48,337 --> 00:14:50,601
Are you suggesting I have
a neurological disorder

332
00:14:50,685 --> 00:14:52,521
that's affecting my
olfactory glands?

333
00:14:52,607 --> 00:14:54,601
You do spend a lot of
time in the sewer.

334
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:59,382
I suppose.
Some of us belong underground.

335
00:15:00,407 --> 00:15:02,153
You can't have any of my hair.

336
00:15:02,866 --> 00:15:06,153
Then I guess the dog's ass
shavings will have to do.

337
00:15:10,116 --> 00:15:11,533
Bees--

338
00:15:11,686 --> 00:15:13,621
The ancient egyptians believed

339
00:15:13,755 --> 00:15:15,990
they were inexorably
entwined with death.

340
00:15:16,127 --> 00:15:18,121
They used honey to
mummify their dead

341
00:15:18,255 --> 00:15:20,910
and left jars of it in the
tombs for food in the afterlife.

342
00:15:20,995 --> 00:15:22,700
You know a lot about bees.

343
00:15:22,826 --> 00:15:25,210
And I suspect you know
a lot about death.

344
00:15:44,155 --> 00:15:45,901
Boy, it's cold.

345
00:15:46,826 --> 00:15:48,282
You know...

346
00:15:48,485 --> 00:15:50,741
You could use a witch's bosom

347
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,030
as a hot-water bottle
on a day like today.

348
00:15:53,195 --> 00:15:54,992
Any sign of Chuck?

349
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,080
And how are you today, Olive?

350
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:01,251
I'm fine. Thanks for asking, Ned.

351
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:03,633
That was a funny joke about
the witch's bosom, Olive.

352
00:16:03,717 --> 00:16:05,540
Well, thanks, Ned.

353
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,880
And I appreciate you
using the word "bosom."

354
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:09,632
Why, Ned?

355
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:11,802
'Cause it's less offensive
than other words?

356
00:16:11,886 --> 00:16:13,623
No, I just simply like
the word "bosom."

357
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,302
I say it to myself all the time.
Bosom, bosom, bosom.

358
00:16:16,386 --> 00:16:18,681
I just can't help myself.
I'm a bosom-oholic.

359
00:16:18,788 --> 00:16:20,771
- Are you done?
- Think so.

360
00:16:20,895 --> 00:16:23,862
- You promise you don't know where she is?
- Why would I know where she is?

361
00:16:23,947 --> 00:16:26,803
Because I keep going over it in my mind,
and Chuck doesn't know many people,

362
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:29,111
and you're not one of the many
people Chuck doesn't know.

363
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:31,842
- Have you slept at all?
- Did you know you have a tell when you lie?

364
00:16:31,926 --> 00:16:33,831
- Do I?
- You answer questions with questions.

365
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,813
Maybe I know I have a tell,
and I know you know

366
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:37,912
I have a tell,
and I'm doing it now to confuse you

367
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:39,861
because you don't know
what tell I'm telling.

368
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:41,682
But why would you go
through the trouble

369
00:16:41,766 --> 00:16:44,313
of answering questions with
questions and pretending to lie

370
00:16:44,395 --> 00:16:47,291
- if you really don't know where she is?
- Can you tell me?

371
00:16:51,805 --> 00:16:54,802
Victor Narramore turned down 15
people for organ transplants.

372
00:16:54,907 --> 00:16:57,932
Of those 15 people,
3 are viable persons of interest.

373
00:16:58,115 --> 00:17:01,231
- Why only 3 viable?
- Because 12 are not viable.

374
00:17:03,248 --> 00:17:05,522
Yeah, one of those viable
persons of interest

375
00:17:05,695 --> 00:17:08,940
lives in the 200 block on oak street,
named Abner Newsome.

376
00:17:09,118 --> 00:17:11,241
Got turned down for a
new heart a year ago

377
00:17:11,366 --> 00:17:12,993
by Victor Narramore.

378
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,821
- Is Abner Newsome still alive?
- Hence "viable."

379
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:18,333
I should stay here and wait for Chuck,
just in case.

380
00:17:18,418 --> 00:17:20,413
Oh, you don't want to
talk to a sick kid.

381
00:17:20,495 --> 00:17:22,252
No, I understand.
It's a hard, sad life.

382
00:17:22,337 --> 00:17:23,671
Are you really trying

383
00:17:23,768 --> 00:17:25,790
to make me feel guilty
when I'm this depressed?

384
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:27,800
I'm trying to get you
out of your depression.

385
00:17:27,888 --> 00:17:29,923
You don't need me to
talk to the living.

386
00:17:30,055 --> 00:17:31,380
Suit yourself.

387
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,671
But dead girl don't
need you, either.

388
00:17:33,807 --> 00:17:36,141
You're the last person in the
world she wants to talk to,

389
00:17:36,226 --> 00:17:38,143
which is why she ain't here.

390
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:55,652
Before I head out,

391
00:17:55,788 --> 00:17:57,912
I want you to take a
mental picture of me,

392
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,080
your friend Olive,
who's here with digby,

393
00:18:00,195 --> 00:18:02,541
- a snapshot of loyal friends.
- Thank you.

394
00:18:03,795 --> 00:18:06,371
- Did you take your picture?
- Yes.

395
00:18:08,856 --> 00:18:10,860
Oh, look, it's Ned.

396
00:18:10,995 --> 00:18:12,962
Did you shave Digby's--

397
00:18:13,088 --> 00:18:14,642
We don't know how that happened.

398
00:18:14,725 --> 00:18:15,961
Okay, see ya.

399
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,143
Been lookin'.

400
00:18:24,358 --> 00:18:26,101
Been hiding.

401
00:18:27,278 --> 00:18:28,943
How much does Olive know?

402
00:18:29,068 --> 00:18:30,730
Don't worry about what Olive knows.

403
00:18:30,815 --> 00:18:32,981
Even if I told her the truth,
that I died

404
00:18:33,077 --> 00:18:35,320
and you brought me back to life,
she wouldn't believe me.

405
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,630
You don't know that.

406
00:18:36,755 --> 00:18:39,020
Yeye I do, 'cause I told her,
and she wouldn't believe me.

407
00:18:39,107 --> 00:18:40,243
Why would you do that?

408
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,413
Because I needed to tell
somebody the truth,

409
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:44,123
even if they didn't believe me.

410
00:18:44,247 --> 00:18:45,942
I wanted to tell someone the truth

411
00:18:46,046 --> 00:18:48,212
about who I am and what
had happened to me...

412
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:49,790
And what you did to my dad.

413
00:18:49,927 --> 00:18:51,763
Can't we keep the truth
between you and me?

414
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:54,012
It's hard to keep the
truth between you and me

415
00:18:54,098 --> 00:18:55,762
when I can't look at you.

416
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:57,882
I remember that night
when you came over

417
00:18:58,016 --> 00:18:59,722
after dad had died, and...

418
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,142
...You wouldn't look at me.

419
00:19:02,515 --> 00:19:03,972
Chuck, please.

420
00:19:04,107 --> 00:19:06,272
Do you know that no one
could tell me how he died?

421
00:19:06,356 --> 00:19:08,400
I thout it was the
fickle finger of fate,

422
00:19:08,535 --> 00:19:10,770
but it wasn't the
fickle finger of fate.

423
00:19:10,927 --> 00:19:12,902
It was your fickle finger.

424
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:16,761
- That one right there.
- I didn't mean my finger to be fickle.

425
00:19:16,845 --> 00:19:18,492
I didn't know what it would do.

426
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:20,372
I know.
I've rationalized the whole thing.

427
00:19:20,456 --> 00:19:22,182
It was like you were
playing with a gun,

428
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:24,282
and it accidentally went
off and it killed my dad.

429
00:19:24,368 --> 00:19:26,491
Like that, except there's no
gun and I wasn't playing.

430
00:19:26,575 --> 00:19:28,152
My mom died...

431
00:19:28,366 --> 00:19:31,122
And, yeah,
I'm the kid who killed your dad,

432
00:19:31,676 --> 00:19:32,921
and I hate that.

433
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,170
I hate that, too.

434
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,881
But do you hate me?

435
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:41,011
I have to hate you a little
just for a little while.

436
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:43,223
And I can't do that
if you're still here.

437
00:19:43,425 --> 00:19:45,641
I don't want you to hate me.
I should stay.

438
00:19:45,777 --> 00:19:48,073
If you stay,
I'll just end up hating you more.

439
00:19:49,108 --> 00:19:50,812
Just go.

440
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:58,283
<i>Chuck considered how much
easier circumstances would be</i>

441
00:19:58,426 --> 00:20:02,283
<i>if she had someone to talk to
who wasn't the pie maker...</i>

442
00:20:03,207 --> 00:20:09,002
<i> ...someone who might believe
her secrets if she told them...</i>

443
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:13,712
<i>someone else who
belonged underground.</i>

444
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:21,093
<i>Hot on the trail of
an ice-cold killer,</i>

445
00:20:21,245 --> 00:20:23,243
<i>Mr. Cod paid a visit to the third</i>

446
00:20:23,338 --> 00:20:25,150
<i>of his three persons of interest</i>

447
00:20:25,235 --> 00:20:27,063
<i>in the murder of uber-life</i>

448
00:20:27,217 --> 00:20:29,290
<i>life insurance adjuster
Victor Narramore.</i>

449
00:20:29,377 --> 00:20:31,481
<i>The facts were these --</i>

450
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:33,691
<i>Abner Newsome was a happy child...</i>

451
00:20:33,807 --> 00:20:36,693
<i>for the first 34
seconds of his life,</i>

452
00:20:36,787 --> 00:20:39,691
<i>whereupon it was discovered
that he suffered</i>

453
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,931
<i>from a debilitating
heart condition.</i>

454
00:20:42,018 --> 00:20:45,121
<i>As the singlmother of a sickly,
surly child,</i>

455
00:20:45,226 --> 00:20:47,283
<i>Emma Newsome was a raw nerve,</i>

456
00:20:47,408 --> 00:20:50,043
<i>her son would often
peel like a potato.</i>

457
00:20:50,168 --> 00:20:51,912
When I saw you coming up the block,

458
00:20:51,997 --> 00:20:54,091
I thought you might be from
the wish-a-wish foundation

459
00:20:54,177 --> 00:20:55,963
or some other charity
or a celebrity

460
00:20:56,045 --> 00:20:57,881
or a celebrity
representing a charity.

461
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,340
That's nice.

462
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,840
It's nice for your son to know
there are people that care.

463
00:21:01,925 --> 00:21:03,723
Yeah, caring is great.
Love the caring.

464
00:21:03,808 --> 00:21:05,430
Know what would be even better?

465
00:21:05,727 --> 00:21:07,973
- Not dying.
- Abner, this is Emerson Cox.

466
00:21:08,107 --> 00:21:10,203
- He's investigating a crime.
- It's "Cod."

467
00:21:10,355 --> 00:21:12,603
I heard on the news that that
Narramore guy got whacked.

468
00:21:12,686 --> 00:21:14,522
He turned me down for
a good heart once,

469
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:16,440
so he can pretty much suck it,
I think.

470
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,652
You don't seem too
bereft at his passing.

471
00:21:18,797 --> 00:21:20,860
- I'm not, not at all.
- Abner.

472
00:21:20,998 --> 00:21:23,532
Oh, please,
tell me I'm a suspect. Awesome.

473
00:21:23,686 --> 00:21:25,703
'Cause --
'cause you know what I did first?

474
00:21:25,788 --> 00:21:27,871
I took a magic potion that
made the tissue-paper

475
00:21:27,956 --> 00:21:29,582
sack I call my heart work,

476
00:21:29,707 --> 00:21:31,711
then I stepped on his
neck with the soggy,

477
00:21:31,795 --> 00:21:33,793
atrophied breadsticks
that used to be my legs.

478
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,710
My son is very sick, Mr. Cox.

479
00:21:35,908 --> 00:21:38,341
It's "Cod," and,
uh, I can see that.

480
00:21:38,598 --> 00:21:40,293
If you're not here
to grant us a wish

481
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,022
or give us some free merchandise,

482
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,133
then I think you should leave.

483
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,141
Don't let the door hit you
on your big, oxygenated,

484
00:21:48,228 --> 00:21:49,932
blood-filled ass on the way out.

485
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:51,680
You pushing it.

486
00:21:51,805 --> 00:21:53,760
If I piss you off,
you gonna sneeze and kill me?

487
00:21:53,848 --> 00:21:55,140
Have a nice day!

488
00:21:55,265 --> 00:21:57,441
If you have any more questions,
I'll be right here...

489
00:21:57,527 --> 00:21:59,311
Or slumped in a pile on the floor.

490
00:22:03,746 --> 00:22:06,202
Good boy. Good boy!

491
00:22:07,418 --> 00:22:09,501
Hey, why don't you
leave a present up there

492
00:22:09,587 --> 00:22:11,581
on the porch for them, too.

493
00:22:11,727 --> 00:22:14,123
Everybody around here
got an attitude.

494
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:31,011
<i>Having followed the frozen stiff</i>

495
00:22:31,155 --> 00:22:33,341
<i>from Abner Newsome's
house to the morgue,</i>

496
00:22:33,428 --> 00:22:36,442
<i>- Emerson Cod grew concerned.
- I'm concerned.</i>

497
00:22:36,696 --> 00:22:37,942
About Chuck?

498
00:22:38,078 --> 00:22:40,482
About you and your
mooning over dead girl.

499
00:22:40,615 --> 00:22:42,363
You got to pull yourself together.

500
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:44,033
We got a corpsicle to question.

501
00:22:52,668 --> 00:22:54,870
Freezer burn. Go ahead.

502
00:22:56,878 --> 00:22:59,171
Bill Richter,
uber-life life insurance.

503
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:00,750
If you've got big problems,

504
00:23:00,887 --> 00:23:02,293
we've got bigger solutions.

505
00:23:02,428 --> 00:23:03,842
That's life, uber-life.

506
00:23:04,037 --> 00:23:05,761
Another uber-life insurance agent.

507
00:23:05,888 --> 00:23:07,680
Actually, I prefer
insurance adjuster.

508
00:23:07,768 --> 00:23:09,212
It's my job to assess damage.

509
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:10,961
Maybe it's time for
a self-assessment.

510
00:23:11,048 --> 00:23:12,170
Oh, this.

511
00:23:12,297 --> 00:23:14,483
Guess at's what happens when
you're smacked with a bat.

512
00:23:14,568 --> 00:23:16,020
Any idea who smacked you?

513
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,773
No, but you might
want to ask Kevin.

514
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:18,883
- Kevin?
- Kevin?

515
00:23:19,008 --> 00:23:20,853
Kevin Vanden Eykel. We carpool.

516
00:23:20,976 --> 00:23:22,991
We'd just left the others
and headed for my car,

517
00:23:23,078 --> 00:23:24,600
where I was fumbling for my keys,

518
00:23:24,688 --> 00:23:26,782
when, all of a sudden,
I hear him scream, "Watch out!"

519
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:28,462
Next thing you know, here I am.

520
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:30,032
- Where am I?
- You're, um,

521
00:23:30,418 --> 00:23:31,911
in the morgue.

522
00:23:32,247 --> 00:23:34,341
If I'm dead,
why are you the one with the long face?

523
00:23:34,427 --> 00:23:36,333
Let me guess. Girl problem?

524
00:23:36,538 --> 00:23:37,912
Hell no.

525
00:23:38,035 --> 00:23:40,243
Hell yes. I could see it in his eyes.
What's her name?

526
00:23:40,326 --> 00:23:42,343
I call her Chuck,
but that's not her real name.

527
00:23:42,425 --> 00:23:44,221
It's actually kind
of a funny story.

528
00:23:44,387 --> 00:23:46,933
Would you ask this fool how
he ended up in a snowman?

529
00:23:47,016 --> 00:23:49,061
Sorry, I can't talk
about this right now.

530
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,430
That's okay.

531
00:23:50,568 --> 00:23:52,262
It'll come when you're ready.

532
00:23:52,387 --> 00:23:54,642
Till then, chin up, big guy.

533
00:23:54,977 --> 00:23:56,470
I'm sorry.

534
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:58,602
I thought I'd pulled it together,

535
00:23:58,936 --> 00:24:00,601
and then I came apart.

536
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,010
Well, your coming apart
pulled apart this case.

537
00:24:03,096 --> 00:24:05,423
We still don't know a damn
thing about this killer.

538
00:24:05,505 --> 00:24:08,740
We don't,
but Kevin Vanden Eykel might.

539
00:24:13,455 --> 00:24:14,860
Are you Kevin Vanden Eykel?

540
00:24:15,035 --> 00:24:17,623
Nope. Steve Kaiser.

541
00:24:17,746 --> 00:24:19,960
I've been covering Kevin's
cases since he went missing.

542
00:24:20,046 --> 00:24:21,212
When did he go missing?

543
00:24:21,337 --> 00:24:23,711
Same night as Bill Richter
and Victor Narramore.

544
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,170
In all probability,
he's dead like them.

545
00:24:26,305 --> 00:24:28,761
Of course, the company's not
gonna pay off on his policy

546
00:24:28,845 --> 00:24:30,263
until the police find a body,

547
00:24:30,348 --> 00:24:32,813
so his wife's been struggling
to keep her head above water.

548
00:24:32,896 --> 00:24:34,983
I'm surprised they didn't
just cancel her insurance

549
00:24:35,068 --> 00:24:36,733
and put the final
nail in her coffin.

550
00:24:36,816 --> 00:24:38,201
Sounds like you don't approve

551
00:24:38,285 --> 00:24:40,031
of how things are done around here.

552
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,802
Who'd you say you work for, again?

553
00:24:41,888 --> 00:24:43,520
We didn't.
I'm a private investigator.

554
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,641
- This is my associate.
- I think I've said enough.

555
00:24:45,727 --> 00:24:47,242
If you gentlemen will excuse me...

556
00:24:47,325 --> 00:24:49,063
Hold on.
Bill Richter's body was found

557
00:24:49,147 --> 00:24:51,112
in the front yard of a
b*** yamed Abner Newsome.

558
00:24:51,196 --> 00:24:52,940
All we're trying to
do is find out why.

559
00:24:53,028 --> 00:24:55,790
From what we can gather, Abner
applied to uber-life several times.

560
00:24:55,877 --> 00:24:57,830
Was Bill working on Abner's case?

561
00:24:58,837 --> 00:25:00,661
Bill, Victor, and Kevin

562
00:25:00,868 --> 00:25:03,171
all rejected Abner for
a heart transplant.

563
00:25:03,296 --> 00:25:05,250
That's something we in
the private-eye business

564
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:06,840
like to call "a pattern."

565
00:25:07,388 --> 00:25:08,882
- Let's go.
- Asses.

566
00:25:09,046 --> 00:25:10,880
Excuse me?

567
00:25:11,016 --> 00:25:13,261
I'm talking about the
suits who run this place.

568
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:15,362
Good god.
How many people have to pay the price

569
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,301
before that boy
finally gets a heart?

570
00:25:17,396 --> 00:25:19,272
Why don't you just
approve his application?

571
00:25:19,358 --> 00:25:20,850
Because I'll lose my job.

572
00:25:20,976 --> 00:25:23,061
Besides, it's not up to me.
It's up to the numbers,

573
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:24,601
and his number's almost up.

574
00:25:24,726 --> 00:25:27,190
Low survival odds plus
exorbitant transplant

575
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,552
costs equals bad business,

576
00:25:28,678 --> 00:25:30,450
and that's the bottom
line around here.

577
00:25:30,536 --> 00:25:32,321
Hell, if this place
has taught me anything,

578
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:34,692
it's people are expendable.

579
00:25:53,598 --> 00:25:56,592
- I got your invitation.
- I'm glad you came.

580
00:25:57,438 --> 00:25:59,472
I was scared a little bit.

581
00:25:59,598 --> 00:26:02,591
<i>Chuck felt alive holding the
dark secret of her death</i>

582
00:26:02,716 --> 00:26:04,693
<i>so close to the light of day.</i>

583
00:26:04,837 --> 00:26:07,103
- I have a hypothesis.
- Hypothesize.

584
00:26:08,446 --> 00:26:12,652
A cell starved for oxygen,
as in death, is marked.

585
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:14,951
Even after the life returns,

586
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:17,821
the signature of the shock
to the system remains.

587
00:26:18,248 --> 00:26:19,243
How?

588
00:26:19,386 --> 00:26:22,080
There's always the
slightest whiff of ozone,

589
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:24,790
like the fading memory of a dream.

590
00:26:24,928 --> 00:26:27,172
- Do I smell of ozone?
- Your dog does.

591
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:28,923
Did he die and come back?

592
00:26:29,385 --> 00:26:31,020
That would be impossible.

593
00:26:31,126 --> 00:26:33,092
People come back every day.

594
00:26:33,195 --> 00:26:35,171
They fall into frozen lakes,

595
00:26:35,476 --> 00:26:38,143
have heart attacks,
their lungs collapse.

596
00:26:38,895 --> 00:26:41,721
Then someone pulls them
back from the edge.

597
00:26:41,986 --> 00:26:43,853
I think I'd know if Digby died.

598
00:26:44,007 --> 00:26:45,813
Maybe you didn't notice because

599
00:26:45,948 --> 00:26:47,940
you were dying, too.

600
00:26:49,777 --> 00:26:52,150
That's pure conjecture,
based solely

601
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:54,571
on the hair of a d's behind.

602
00:26:54,706 --> 00:26:57,991
<i>Chuck could feel her truth
stepping out of the shadows,</i>

603
00:26:58,097 --> 00:27:00,533
<i>warming its toes in the sunshine,</i>

604
00:27:00,636 --> 00:27:03,293
<i>and the man from the
sewer could sense it.</i>

605
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:06,003
It can be so exhausting
carrying a secret.

606
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:08,873
I need a pair of scissors.

607
00:27:27,028 --> 00:27:28,943
Tell me my secret.

608
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,870
<i>Anticipating the arrival
of a third body,</i>

609
00:27:42,997 --> 00:27:45,242
<i>Emerson Cod and the
pie maker returned</i>

610
00:27:45,438 --> 00:27:47,373
<i>to the house of the heartless boy.</i>

611
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:49,292
Ma'am, the two insurance adjusters

612
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:51,041
that died were both
linked to your boy.

613
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:52,820
We have reason to
believe a third body's

614
00:27:52,908 --> 00:27:54,691
gonna show up on your
lawn sometime soon.

615
00:27:54,777 --> 00:27:57,022
- That's not good.
- Oh, no, that's real good.

616
00:27:57,197 --> 00:27:59,392
'Cause this time,
we're gonna be waiting outside

617
00:27:59,475 --> 00:28:01,042
to catch the iceman when he cometh.

618
00:28:01,126 --> 00:28:02,182
Thank goodness.

619
00:28:02,308 --> 00:28:05,200
A boy with a heart like Abner's
doesn't need any more stress.

620
00:28:05,285 --> 00:28:07,232
Mr. Cod, this is Madeleine McLean.

621
00:28:07,358 --> 00:28:09,691
She's a wish-a-wisher from
the wish-a-wish foundation.

622
00:28:09,778 --> 00:28:11,272
- And this is Bobo.
- A bonobo.

623
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:13,350
I love a man who knows his monkeys.

624
00:28:13,438 --> 00:28:15,691
The bonobo is the
gentlest of primates.

625
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,671
They're great with sick children.

626
00:28:17,787 --> 00:28:19,610
That's why I'm giving him to Abner.

627
00:28:19,748 --> 00:28:21,572
Were you wishing for a cuddle?

628
00:28:21,996 --> 00:28:23,573
Actually, I was wishing for

629
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:25,601
a butter knife so I
could pop out its heart

630
00:28:25,688 --> 00:28:27,382
- and use it as my own.
- Oh, okay.

631
00:28:27,527 --> 00:28:29,162
N-no monkey. Bobo.

632
00:28:29,358 --> 00:28:31,580
How about tickets
to medieval times?

633
00:28:31,685 --> 00:28:33,463
See, on the list of
things I'd like,

634
00:28:33,548 --> 00:28:35,673
cuddling a monkey and
going to medieval times

635
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:37,670
are right next to
constipation and diphtheria.

636
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:40,383
There must be some
wish-a-wish wish you wish for.

637
00:28:40,678 --> 00:28:42,472
Yeah, I wish you'd
all just go away.

638
00:28:42,725 --> 00:28:43,933
All righty, then.

639
00:28:44,018 --> 00:28:45,390
I apologize for Abner,

640
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,313
but he's been feeling
very sick lately.

641
00:28:47,398 --> 00:28:49,142
I think he just wants to be alone.

642
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:52,223
Yeah, we'll be, uh,
outside watching over you both tonight.

643
00:28:57,998 --> 00:29:00,692
The only person with any
real motive is Abner's mom,

644
00:29:00,825 --> 00:29:02,572
but, hell, that's just cold stupid.

645
00:29:02,705 --> 00:29:03,952
Right.

646
00:29:04,115 --> 00:29:06,660
What kind of killer leaves
her victims in her own lawn?

647
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:08,992
We sit here long enough,
we'll find out.

648
00:29:11,797 --> 00:29:14,291
Would you quit wiggle-warting?
You're steaming up

649
00:29:14,677 --> 00:29:16,712
the windows and giving the
neighbors the wrong idea.

650
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:18,722
I can't help it.
My body's staked out here.

651
00:29:18,807 --> 00:29:20,841
My mind's staked out where she is,
wherever that is.

652
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,682
I know you ain't gonna
start talking about

653
00:29:22,768 --> 00:29:24,192
dead girl on our stakeout.

654
00:29:24,315 --> 00:29:26,563
What do you think chahaes
are of getting her back?

655
00:29:26,646 --> 00:29:28,720
Do I look like a damn
ouija board to you?

656
00:29:28,878 --> 00:29:30,431
What if Steve Kaiser was right,

657
00:29:30,588 --> 00:29:32,810
and life just adds up
to one big calculation

658
00:29:32,948 --> 00:29:34,901
where you take all the
good you've ever done

659
00:29:34,988 --> 00:29:36,732
and subtract all the bad?

660
00:29:36,867 --> 00:29:38,862
After what I've done...

661
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:41,491
What if Chuck and I don't add up?

662
00:29:41,637 --> 00:29:43,902
Oh, you add up... to zero.

663
00:29:44,066 --> 00:29:45,203
Zero?

664
00:29:45,678 --> 00:29:47,992
As in zero interest
in discussing it.

665
00:29:48,175 --> 00:29:49,951
You don't understand.

666
00:29:51,585 --> 00:29:53,911
Oh, I understand
better than you think.

667
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:56,172
You feel like you--

668
00:29:56,277 --> 00:29:58,130
like you messed up,

669
00:29:58,257 --> 00:30:00,003
like you just lost the only person

670
00:30:00,136 --> 00:30:01,680
who ever meant anything to you.

671
00:30:01,778 --> 00:30:03,972
Part of you feels like
it's for the best,

672
00:30:04,308 --> 00:30:06,552
and like maybe you
never even deserved her

673
00:30:06,897 --> 00:30:08,851
- in the first place.
- O-kay,

674
00:30:08,966 --> 00:30:10,512
maybe you understand,

675
00:30:10,607 --> 00:30:12,813
but there's something I
can do to get Chuck back.

676
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:15,232
I can give her back her father,
if only to say goodbye.

677
00:30:15,316 --> 00:30:16,681
The relationship

678
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,860
between a father and
his daughter is tenuous.

679
00:30:20,758 --> 00:30:22,441
It's very fragile.

680
00:30:22,607 --> 00:30:24,320
It could take a lifetime

681
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:26,201
to sort out all the issues there.

682
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:27,993
And, what? You think you can just

683
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:29,873
"Happily ever after"
it after one minute?

684
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:31,833
Man, you a dreamer.

685
00:30:31,968 --> 00:30:34,040
- And you're a cynic.
- I'm a father.

686
00:30:34,545 --> 00:30:37,421
- As in a priest?
- As in a man

687
00:30:37,755 --> 00:30:39,711
with a daughter.

688
00:30:39,845 --> 00:30:41,670
You have a daughter? Where is she?

689
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:43,210
Why don't you ever--

690
00:30:43,336 --> 00:30:45,380
Scratching an itch
only makes it itchier.

691
00:30:45,475 --> 00:30:46,723
This is my itch,

692
00:30:46,848 --> 00:30:49,470
and I sure as hell don't want
you scratching it, understood?

693
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:51,141
Understood. No more scratching.

694
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,601
My itches or yours.

695
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:55,580
Good.

696
00:30:55,718 --> 00:30:58,190
<i>Emerson Cod focused
back on the case,</i>

697
00:30:58,327 --> 00:31:00,063
<i>little knowing someone else</i>

698
00:31:00,197 --> 00:31:02,860
<i>was focused on Emerson
and the pie maker.</i>

699
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,670
Emerson! Wake up!

700
00:31:37,567 --> 00:31:40,270
Emerson, come on. Come on.

701
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:44,153
It feels like my head
is gonna split in two.

702
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:45,981
It's carbon-monoxide poisoning.

703
00:31:46,105 --> 00:31:48,242
Someone put a potato
in our tail pipe.

704
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:49,362
Oh, lord.

705
00:31:49,476 --> 00:31:51,463
- Please tell me I ain't dead.
- You're not dead.

706
00:31:51,546 --> 00:31:53,550
And I can be not dead
for longer than a minute?

707
00:31:53,635 --> 00:31:55,090
There are no minutes involved.

708
00:31:55,176 --> 00:31:57,180
You will continue to be
not dead until you're dead,

709
00:31:57,268 --> 00:31:59,143
but I've never undeaded
you at any point.

710
00:31:59,227 --> 00:32:01,150
You may be dying from
breathing a poisonous gas,

711
00:32:01,235 --> 00:32:02,501
but dead-- no.

712
00:32:02,626 --> 00:32:03,913
Oh, hell.

713
00:32:04,058 --> 00:32:06,303
<i>Realizing their lives
were still lives,</i>

714
00:32:06,388 --> 00:32:08,640
<i>the pie maker and the
private investigator</i>

715
00:32:08,728 --> 00:32:12,010
<i>could not say the same for
the body surely frozen</i>

716
00:32:12,147 --> 00:32:13,932
<i>in the freshly made snowman.</i>

717
00:32:14,225 --> 00:32:15,810
See? I used to love snowmen.

718
00:32:19,857 --> 00:32:22,353
<i>The Darling Mermaid
Darlings overcame</i>

719
00:32:22,495 --> 00:32:24,820
<i>their incapacitating social phobias</i>

720
00:32:24,948 --> 00:32:27,333
<i>with the help of Chuck's
mood-enhancing pies.</i>

721
00:32:27,418 --> 00:32:29,401
<i>But unbeknownst to all,</i>

722
00:32:29,605 --> 00:32:31,782
<i>this latest pie wasn't just dosed.</i>

723
00:32:31,927 --> 00:32:33,492
<i>It was overdosed.</i>

724
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:35,583
I have been craving
this pie all day.

725
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:37,580
That's not what I've
been doing all day.

726
00:32:37,668 --> 00:32:39,422
We're making costumes
for our next tour.

727
00:32:39,505 --> 00:32:41,212
If we have a next tour.

728
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:50,170
None for me, thanks.
I don't like vanilla.

729
00:32:50,305 --> 00:32:52,593
I didn't ask either of
you if you wanted pie.

730
00:32:52,688 --> 00:32:53,970
I'm in training.

731
00:32:54,127 --> 00:32:55,940
<i>The aunts had begun to hope again,</i>

732
00:32:56,028 --> 00:32:58,311
<i>which left Olive with
one simple wish.</i>

733
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:00,730
I sure wish Charlotte
could see you like this.

734
00:33:00,816 --> 00:33:02,630
Maybe Charlotte can
see us like this.

735
00:33:02,718 --> 00:33:04,522
Evidently, her ghost is about.

736
00:33:04,727 --> 00:33:05,902
Really?

737
00:33:06,306 --> 00:33:07,983
Someone's seen her ghost?

738
00:33:08,188 --> 00:33:09,820
<i>Meanwhile...</i>

739
00:33:10,286 --> 00:33:12,201
<i>Chuck considered the
risk she'd taken</i>

740
00:33:12,286 --> 00:33:14,781
<i>by sharing her secret with the
man from below the ground.</i>

741
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:17,611
<i>She wondered what he would
discover in the swath</i>

742
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:20,331
<i>of brunette truth she had given up.</i>

743
00:33:20,636 --> 00:33:22,331
<i>And then...</i>

744
00:33:22,665 --> 00:33:24,882
- Hello, Chuck.
- You sneak up on people.

745
00:33:25,006 --> 00:33:26,841
That could get you
inadvertently bludgeoned

746
00:33:26,925 --> 00:33:28,253
with a rolling pin.

747
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:31,050
I find a bludgeoning to be
a unique sensory experience.

748
00:33:31,138 --> 00:33:34,551
I taste pennies and
smell burnt toast.

749
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:39,103
- I came to return the hair.
- My hair?

750
00:33:39,437 --> 00:33:40,690
It's a gesture of trust.

751
00:33:40,796 --> 00:33:43,180
You know everything there
is to tell about the hair.

752
00:33:43,265 --> 00:33:44,962
I'd rather hear about it from you.

753
00:33:45,077 --> 00:33:46,471
I think you want to tell me.

754
00:33:46,636 --> 00:33:47,733
<i>In that moment,</i>

755
00:33:47,847 --> 00:33:51,190
<i>Chuck realized her hate and
sadness had begun to fall.</i>

756
00:33:51,315 --> 00:33:54,413
<i>There was only one person with
whom she wished to share</i>

757
00:33:54,556 --> 00:33:56,820
<i>the burden of an
impossible secret...</i>

758
00:33:56,918 --> 00:33:59,020
Should have asked the hair
while you had the chance.

759
00:33:59,105 --> 00:34:00,761
<i> ...The pie maker.</i>

760
00:34:01,465 --> 00:34:04,460
In Bulgaria, we were en route

761
00:34:04,598 --> 00:34:07,170
to a competition when
a band of gypsies

762
00:34:07,287 --> 00:34:08,751
stopped the train.

763
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:10,592
They came through the cabin

764
00:34:10,726 --> 00:34:12,592
and stole one woman's watch

765
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:15,262
- and her soul.
- They didn't take her soul.

766
00:34:15,475 --> 00:34:17,930
Well, she was ornery and
vacant after they left.

767
00:34:18,085 --> 00:34:20,060
Because they took her watch!

768
00:34:20,245 --> 00:34:22,982
I can't imagine the
adventures you've been on.

769
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:24,812
Oh, my, Lily.

770
00:34:25,238 --> 00:34:27,231
Did you eat t-the whole pie?

771
00:34:29,238 --> 00:34:31,073
Are you feeling all right?

772
00:34:46,506 --> 00:34:48,501
What did you put in that pie?

773
00:34:48,655 --> 00:34:50,000
Just vanilla.

774
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:52,671
Oh, there's no vanilla in that pie.

775
00:34:52,807 --> 00:34:56,093
<i>As Olive wondered what
exactly she did put</i>

776
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:58,893
<i>in Lily and Vivian's pie,
Emerson Cod,</i>

777
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:02,890
<i>private investigator,
drew an intriguing conclusion.</i>

778
00:35:03,038 --> 00:35:05,730
We are giant, enmomo idiots,

779
00:35:05,845 --> 00:35:08,653
and don't you say "ginormous,"
'cause that ain't a word.

780
00:35:08,778 --> 00:35:11,071
Whoever plugged our tail pipe
waited for us to pass out

781
00:35:11,156 --> 00:35:12,861
and then put the body in the lawn.

782
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:15,240
Mrs. Newsome was peeling
potatoes yesterday.

783
00:35:15,368 --> 00:35:16,822
Maybe we were wrong about her.

784
00:35:16,905 --> 00:35:19,031
Yeah, maybe she has
gone all blood simple,

785
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:20,793
hiding her victims
all up in snowmen.

786
00:35:20,878 --> 00:35:22,121
Kevin would know.

787
00:35:22,295 --> 00:35:23,742
Yeah, let's ask him.

788
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:28,180
Or not. I'm not touching that.

789
00:35:28,446 --> 00:35:30,713
Fine with me.
Let's talk to Miss Newsome.

790
00:35:36,495 --> 00:35:37,931
What happened?

791
00:35:38,055 --> 00:35:40,182
The insurance company
rejected Abner again.

792
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:41,670
Nice meeting everyone.

793
00:35:41,816 --> 00:35:43,391
Now, if you'll pardon me,

794
00:35:43,518 --> 00:35:45,443
I'll be sucking pureed
turkey through a straw

795
00:35:45,525 --> 00:35:47,851
while my organs putrefy, but,
hey, you enjoy yourselves.

796
00:35:47,936 --> 00:35:50,403
Do you know who it was who called
from the insurance company?

797
00:35:50,488 --> 00:35:52,130
Why? You want to send
him a card, too?

798
00:35:52,215 --> 00:35:53,752
- Send who a card?
- Mr. Kaiser.

799
00:35:53,835 --> 00:35:56,110
The wish-a-wish lady called.
After I told her about Abner,

800
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:59,200
she said she wanted to let Mr.
Kaiser know about her foundation.

801
00:35:59,288 --> 00:36:01,531
The wish-a-wish lady.
She's a kill-a-killer.

802
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:05,621
<i>Emerson Cod and the
pie maker arrived</i>

803
00:36:05,728 --> 00:36:07,420
<i>at uber-life life insurance</i>

804
00:36:07,587 --> 00:36:09,920
<i>in an attempt to find
Steve Kaiser...</i>

805
00:36:12,345 --> 00:36:14,531
What are the chances of that?
<i>- ...Before</i>

806
00:36:14,615 --> 00:36:16,762
<i>an act of kindness found him.</i>

807
00:36:22,227 --> 00:36:24,351
What are the odds of
you having a daughter?

808
00:36:24,436 --> 00:36:26,481
'Cause you've never actually
mentioned her before.

809
00:36:26,566 --> 00:36:28,231
First off,
you're like my grandfather.

810
00:36:28,317 --> 00:36:30,230
You slow down when you talk,
so stop talking.

811
00:36:30,317 --> 00:36:31,980
Second off,
when I said what I said,

812
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:33,402
it wasn't said in the

813
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,613
"we need to talk more about
this later" kind of way.

814
00:36:35,697 --> 00:36:37,583
It was said in the "I
regret what I'm saying.

815
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:40,331
There must be a potato in the tail
pipe" kind of way, so stop talking.

816
00:36:40,418 --> 00:36:42,080
<i>As Emerson and the
pie maker closed in</i>

817
00:36:42,168 --> 00:36:43,703
<i>on the killer wish maker,</i>

818
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:46,632
<i>the wish maker had already
found her next snowman.</i>

819
00:36:49,756 --> 00:36:51,752
Stupid frozen door.

820
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:55,880
Oh, shoot.

821
00:36:56,427 --> 00:36:57,630
A ding.

822
00:37:06,898 --> 00:37:08,990
- I just didn't want you to think--
- Stop.

823
00:37:09,087 --> 00:37:10,833
I've been so focused
on myself lately.

824
00:37:10,915 --> 00:37:12,752
Stop the car!

825
00:37:15,277 --> 00:37:17,101
I'm gonna need you
to stop wildin' on

826
00:37:17,187 --> 00:37:19,070
the insurance adjuster, ma'am.

827
00:37:19,418 --> 00:37:21,610
What if I have a gun, too?

828
00:37:21,748 --> 00:37:23,782
Oh, you don't have to
do this. Madeleine,

829
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:25,623
please put the gun
and the bat down...

830
00:37:25,705 --> 00:37:27,750
- or definitely the gun.
- Is that your wish?

831
00:37:27,835 --> 00:37:28,952
I'm sorry?

832
00:37:29,087 --> 00:37:30,791
Because granting wishes is my job.

833
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,413
<i>The facts were these --</i>

834
00:37:32,586 --> 00:37:34,340
<i>Madeleine McLean was
a dream come true</i>

835
00:37:34,428 --> 00:37:36,022
<i>at the wish-a-wish foundation,</i>

836
00:37:36,105 --> 00:37:38,011
<i>where she provided
succor with suckers,</i>

837
00:37:38,095 --> 00:37:40,170
<i>coaxed chuckles from colics.</i>

838
00:37:41,306 --> 00:37:44,430
<i>But she met her match
in Abner Newsome,</i>

839
00:37:44,588 --> 00:37:46,762
<i>the little boy who lacked a heart.</i>

840
00:37:47,058 --> 00:37:48,002
I'm maddy.

841
00:37:48,206 --> 00:37:49,863
Why don't you tell me about your

842
00:37:50,056 --> 00:37:51,811
super-special self, sweetheart?

843
00:37:51,967 --> 00:37:54,141
That basket smells like old pus.

844
00:37:55,246 --> 00:37:57,982
<i>And though she tried and tried...</i>

845
00:37:59,405 --> 00:38:02,363
I said,
"lap dance," not "tap dance."

846
00:38:02,686 --> 00:38:04,820
There must be
something you wish for.

847
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:07,070
Yeah, I wish those
insurance-company jerks

848
00:38:07,206 --> 00:38:09,040
who keep rejecting
me would drop dead.

849
00:38:09,126 --> 00:38:11,171
<i> ...Until she realized
the boy without a heart</i>

850
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:12,872
<i>wanted revenge.</i>

851
00:38:13,016 --> 00:38:16,793
<i>As Madeleine McLean prepared to
grant one last deadly desire,</i>

852
00:38:16,948 --> 00:38:20,133
<i>Bobo the bonobo monkey
had a wish of its own --</i>

853
00:38:20,285 --> 00:38:24,341
<i>to play with a ball on a
stick called the shifter.</i>

854
00:38:29,637 --> 00:38:32,470
<i>And so its wish was granted...</i>

855
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:37,190
<i>As was the wish of
Madeleine McLean,</i>

856
00:38:37,346 --> 00:38:39,941
<i>for though her sanity
was torn asunder</i>

857
00:38:40,107 --> 00:38:42,151
<i>by a boy named Abner Newsome</i>

858
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:45,611
<i>and her body was torn apart
by a bonobo named Bobo,</i>

859
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:47,951
<i>her heart was still intact,</i>

860
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:50,911
<i>which allowed her to
grant one final wish,</i>

861
00:38:51,798 --> 00:38:54,502
<i>and that was for Abner Newsome</i>

862
00:38:54,655 --> 00:38:56,960
<i>to have a change of heart --</i>

863
00:38:57,118 --> 00:38:59,791
<i>Madeleine McLean's heart.</i>

864
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:09,141
<i>The pie maker came upon another
heart in need of repair.</i>

865
00:39:17,908 --> 00:39:18,820
Chuck?

866
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,363
There's no headstone for me yet.

867
00:39:23,657 --> 00:39:25,080
We wait a year.

868
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,061
How did you know I was here?

869
00:39:27,456 --> 00:39:29,453
Because I've been
everywhere else first.

870
00:39:29,828 --> 00:39:32,120
Is "a little while"
over yet? Because

871
00:39:32,456 --> 00:39:34,841
I can't bear the thought
of you hating me still.

872
00:39:34,927 --> 00:39:36,542
I feel better.

873
00:39:38,506 --> 00:39:40,250
I have an idea.

874
00:39:44,345 --> 00:39:47,263
- No.
- I thought, for one minute --

875
00:39:47,486 --> 00:39:49,013
I'm not gonna bring him back

876
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:51,133
just so you can watch
me kill him again.

877
00:39:51,226 --> 00:39:53,321
I can't do that to you. I won't.

878
00:39:53,535 --> 00:39:55,563
<i>Chuck wished things were different.</i>

879
00:39:55,646 --> 00:39:57,483
<i>She wished she knew her father.</i>

880
00:39:57,568 --> 00:39:59,282
<i>She wished she knew her mother.</i>

881
00:39:59,366 --> 00:40:01,352
<i>She wished the pie
maker could comfort her</i>

882
00:40:01,437 --> 00:40:03,272
<i>by holding her close.</i>

883
00:40:03,405 --> 00:40:05,991
<i>Not all those wishes
were meant to be,</i>

884
00:40:06,177 --> 00:40:08,602
<i>but one of them was.</i>

885
00:40:08,745 --> 00:40:11,743
I love the quiet on a snowy night.

886
00:40:12,578 --> 00:40:17,082
No, I feel fine. Much better now.

887
00:40:18,006 --> 00:40:21,330
Stop it.
You're the one who should be cold.

888
00:40:24,098 --> 00:40:26,343
That was good pie.

889
00:40:26,965 --> 00:40:30,511
When Charlotte was young,
after we moved in,

890
00:40:30,686 --> 00:40:32,891
she used to stand right--
right there

891
00:40:33,045 --> 00:40:34,761
where you're floating

892
00:40:34,925 --> 00:40:36,973
and watch the snow with me.

893
00:40:37,316 --> 00:40:39,850
At night, while she slept,

894
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:43,520
I'd sneak into the backyard
and make two snow angels.

895
00:40:44,116 --> 00:40:48,242
She never said anything,
and I'd always play dumb.

896
00:40:48,785 --> 00:40:51,161
She thought they were her parents.

897
00:40:51,678 --> 00:40:54,202
One was her father.

898
00:40:55,127 --> 00:40:59,661
- The other one was me.
- You?

899
00:41:00,378 --> 00:41:02,920
I'm Charlotte's mother.
