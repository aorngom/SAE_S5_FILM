<i>Previously on
"Pushing daisies"...</i>

2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:04,595
Charlotte was a nice girl.

3
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:08,592
What if you didn't
have to be dead?

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,052
Nobody can know.

5
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,774
You touch murder victims,
you ask who killed them.

6
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:14,485
You touch them again,they
go back to being dead,

7
00:00:14,524 --> 00:00:17,274
- and you collect the reward?
- That's it in a nutshell.

8
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:20,365
- Who's the funny girl stuck to Ned?
- Childhood Sweetheart.

9
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,284
- Do they touch much?
- Wish they would.

10
00:00:22,315 --> 00:00:24,360
What's she doing here?
That girl's got to go.

11
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:25,746
That girl's not going anywhere.

12
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:27,335
We haven't seen each
other in like 20 years.

13
00:00:27,366 --> 00:00:28,837
Don't you want to
know about me?

14
00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:31,861
- I want to know everything about you.
- We all have secrets.

Season 1 Episode 3 - The Fun in Funeral
For www.forom.com

16
00:00:40,746 --> 00:00:44,212
<i>At this very moment,
young Ned was 9 years, 34 weeks,</i>

17
00:00:44,505 --> 00:00:46,791
<i>12 hours,
and 54 minutes old.</i>

18
00:00:47,138 --> 00:00:48,632
<i>He was a gifted boy.</i>

19
00:00:48,885 --> 00:00:51,462
<i>Not academically,
nor athletically.</i>

20
00:00:51,765 --> 00:00:55,220
<i>He was gifted in a way no
other boy was gifted.</i>

21
00:00:55,478 --> 00:00:57,403
<i>Young Ned could
touch dead things</i>

22
00:00:57,436 --> 00:00:59,180
<i>and bring them
back to life.</i>

23
00:00:59,766 --> 00:01:02,060
<i>But if he touched the
dead thing twice,</i>

24
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:04,312
<i>it died
again... forever.</i>

25
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,690
<i>The consequence of not
touching a dead thing twice</i>

26
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:13,690
<i>was as cruel as any consequence,
and that was</i>

27
00:01:13,998 --> 00:01:16,073
<i>something else
had to die.</i>

28
00:01:18,377 --> 00:01:20,831
<i>Young Ned rationalized
this consequence</i>

29
00:01:20,996 --> 00:01:22,490
<i>was beyond his control.</i>

30
00:01:22,546 --> 00:01:23,952
<i>He was not to blame.</i>

31
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:28,083
<i>But to remain blameless,
he had to understand.</i>

32
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:40,221
<i>He realized to give life,
he had to take it.</i>

33
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:43,313
<i>Death, however,
had a grace period.</i>

34
00:01:43,568 --> 00:01:47,851
<i>What young Ned did not know was
how long that grace period was.</i>

35
00:01:49,658 --> 00:01:50,942
<i>One minute.</i>

36
00:01:53,785 --> 00:01:56,241
<i>Fearing the consequences
of his actions,</i>

37
00:01:56,298 --> 00:01:59,242
<i>Ned vowed to never,
ever again bring the dead</i>

38
00:01:59,258 --> 00:02:01,701
<i>back to life for more
than a minute...</i>

39
00:02:02,586 --> 00:02:04,121
<i>Until he did it again.</i>

40
00:02:05,336 --> 00:02:07,542
<i>The expression
"pie in the sky"</i>

41
00:02:07,968 --> 00:02:10,423
<i>entered popular
culture in 1911.</i>

42
00:02:10,677 --> 00:02:12,880
<i>It refers to a
dessert so sweet,</i>

43
00:02:13,135 --> 00:02:15,030
<i>it can only be
found in heaven.</i>

44
00:02:15,517 --> 00:02:18,221
<i>If you're craving
something before you die,</i>

45
00:02:18,518 --> 00:02:21,210
<i>I recommend where the pie
maker makes his pies.</i>

46
00:02:21,647 --> 00:02:23,262
<i>But if you're
like Chuck,</i>

47
00:02:23,516 --> 00:02:26,432
<i>you may enjoy the pie
even after you die.</i>

48
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,691
<i>Her 60 seconds
came and went.</i>

49
00:02:28,895 --> 00:02:30,230
<i>She stayed alive,</i>

50
00:02:30,488 --> 00:02:32,691
<i>and instead,
someone else had to die.</i>

51
00:02:32,988 --> 00:02:35,581
<i>He kept Chuck blissfully
unaware of this fact.</i>

52
00:02:35,615 --> 00:02:37,032
<i>She was alive again.</i>

53
00:02:37,286 --> 00:02:38,492
<i>That was that.</i>

54
00:02:38,747 --> 00:02:40,240
Which birthday do I celebrate?

55
00:02:40,328 --> 00:02:41,910
I've got two of them now--

56
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,172
The first day I was alive,
the first day I was alive again.

57
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,010
The one that requires
less explanation.

58
00:02:46,047 --> 00:02:47,380
You remember my 8th birthday,

59
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,792
right before my dad died?

60
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:50,501
You remember what you got me?

61
00:02:50,967 --> 00:02:53,292
- A t-shirt.
- With a beaver on it.

62
00:02:53,595 --> 00:02:55,390
He had little lipstick
kisses on his cheek,

63
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,810
and he was holding
a sign saying,

64
00:02:56,846 --> 00:02:58,640
"Be kind to animals.
Kiss a beaver."

65
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:01,560
I suppose I should be celebrating
every minute now, shouldn't I?

66
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,802
I could be anybody now,
anybody I want.

67
00:03:04,057 --> 00:03:05,820
I like that idea.
I'm gonna give that some thought.

68
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,853
<i>The pie maker</i>

69
00:03:07,065 --> 00:03:08,662
<i>liked that idea,
as well,</i>

70
00:03:08,776 --> 00:03:10,822
<i>as long as her thoughts
didn't fall on...</i>

71
00:03:10,855 --> 00:03:12,271
Why is it only a minute?

72
00:03:12,566 --> 00:03:14,210
A minute seems
awfully arbitrary.

73
00:03:14,237 --> 00:03:16,543
Oh, a minute's a long time.
A lot can happen in a minute.

74
00:03:16,577 --> 00:03:18,040
Besides, t-the longer
someone's around

75
00:03:18,077 --> 00:03:19,413
that's not supposed
to be around,

76
00:03:19,447 --> 00:03:21,953
the more likely it is that
something will happen--

77
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:24,590
not necessarily directly
or by any fault of theirs,

78
00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:26,830
but, you know,
butterfly wings and such.

79
00:03:27,086 --> 00:03:28,921
- What about 'em?
- They cause hurricanes.

80
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,911
Oh, right. Am I a hurricane?

81
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:33,631
A little bit, but I, uh--
I like the weather.

82
00:03:40,426 --> 00:03:43,393
You really shouldn't do that.

83
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:47,851
<i>Chuck wasn't the only storm brewing
in the pie hole that evening.</i>

84
00:03:48,776 --> 00:03:51,891
<i>An innocuous low-pressure
system was forming</i>

85
00:03:52,146 --> 00:03:54,523
<i>that would soon become
hurricane Olive.</i>

86
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:57,830
<i>Watching the pie maker kiss
the woman that wasn't her,</i>

87
00:03:57,867 --> 00:03:59,413
<i>Olive stopped breathing.</i>

88
00:03:59,658 --> 00:04:01,791
<i>It was as if all the
oxygen had left the room.</i>

89
00:04:01,828 --> 00:04:03,203
Espresso, please.

90
00:04:03,825 --> 00:04:05,072
We have coffee.

91
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:07,053
- You have an espresso machine.
- It's broken--

92
00:04:07,085 --> 00:04:09,432
Sits there being pretty,
but nobody touches it.

93
00:04:09,587 --> 00:04:11,372
- Decaf or regular?
- No flavors--

94
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:14,371
- Hazelnut, french vanilla?
- Why can't sugar be enough?

95
00:04:16,046 --> 00:04:17,172
Here's your sugar.

96
00:04:18,098 --> 00:04:19,670
Oh, I forgot to breathe.

97
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:23,161
Ever feel like all the
oxygen left the room?

98
00:04:23,307 --> 00:04:24,262
Oh, my, yes.

99
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:25,533
<i>In that moment,</i>

100
00:04:25,936 --> 00:04:29,681
<i>Alfredo Aldarisio recognized a
kindred spirit in Olive snook.</i>

101
00:04:29,938 --> 00:04:33,322
<i>He also lived in constant fear
of the oxygen leaving the room,</i>

102
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:35,813
<i>but his pathology ran much,
much deeper.</i>

103
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,622
<i>He was haunted by the notion that,
at any moment,</i>

104
00:04:38,657 --> 00:04:40,542
<i>the earth could lose
its atmosphere,</i>

105
00:04:40,576 --> 00:04:43,322
<i>and he would be sucked
into the vacuum of space.</i>

106
00:04:49,548 --> 00:04:50,580
Excuse me.

107
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,761
<i>A traveling
salesman by trade,</i>

108
00:04:52,796 --> 00:04:55,541
<i>Mr. Aldarisio sells
pharmaceutical alternatives,</i>

109
00:04:55,876 --> 00:04:58,572
<i>which he also uses to
manage his condition.</i>

110
00:04:58,797 --> 00:04:59,922
Medicinal.

111
00:05:00,636 --> 00:05:03,060
You're not wrong about the
oxygen leaving the room.

112
00:05:03,098 --> 00:05:05,193
The planet is losing atmosphere.
It's affecting gravity.

113
00:05:05,226 --> 00:05:06,902
Volumes aren't what
they used to be.

114
00:05:06,936 --> 00:05:08,480
They had to adjust
the kilogram.

115
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,601
Well, if you ask me,

116
00:05:09,855 --> 00:05:11,781
the kilogram needs to
be taken down a peg.

117
00:05:11,815 --> 00:05:13,812
- Decaf or regular?
- Regular,

118
00:05:14,108 --> 00:05:16,903
lots of sugar,
more than enough.

119
00:05:20,707 --> 00:05:24,702
<i>Emerson Cod, private investigator,
made a business of murder,</i>

120
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,003
<i>but before he could get
down to business...</i>

121
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:28,492
I feel like ice cream.

122
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,743
Musing on the idea of
setting someone on fire

123
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:33,842
doesn't mean you really
want to set them on fire.

124
00:05:33,877 --> 00:05:35,521
It's just the thought of
it that makes you happy,

125
00:05:35,557 --> 00:05:37,473
but only for a second.
Then you feel bad,

126
00:05:37,507 --> 00:05:38,782
but that second can
be a lot of fun.

127
00:05:38,817 --> 00:05:40,732
You thinking of setting
someone on fire?

128
00:05:40,765 --> 00:05:41,973
No, I was just speaking
in the figurative.

129
00:05:42,018 --> 00:05:43,501
But figuratively speaking,

130
00:05:43,518 --> 00:05:45,852
someone should set you on fire for
throwing my heart under the bus

131
00:05:45,886 --> 00:05:47,523
when you told me
he didn't want me.

132
00:05:47,557 --> 00:05:49,212
- That was the truth bus.
- That wasn't the truth bus.

133
00:05:49,287 --> 00:05:50,942
That was the bitchy
crosstown express.

134
00:05:50,978 --> 00:05:52,730
By "bitchy," you mean
"frank and honest"?

135
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:54,421
If I want frank and honest--

136
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,651
Well, I don't want
frank and honest.

137
00:05:56,697 --> 00:06:00,093
I never want frank and honest,
so let's just take it off the docket.

138
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,333
While we're on the subject
of frank and honest,

139
00:06:04,367 --> 00:06:07,112
I don't like that girl,
not one bit.

140
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,710
<i>Emerson Cod liked
her even less,</i>

141
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:18,040
<i>so much so,</i>

142
00:06:18,138 --> 00:06:21,253
<i>it warranted a private
conversation with the pie maker,</i>

143
00:06:21,796 --> 00:06:23,550
<i> but not private enough.</i>

144
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,766
So, somebody died?
How did they die?

145
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:27,765
They died mysteriously.

146
00:06:27,976 --> 00:06:29,437
He somebody or she somebody?

147
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:31,901
He. I told you I wanted to
discuss this in private.

148
00:06:31,937 --> 00:06:33,010
Chuck is private--

149
00:06:33,358 --> 00:06:34,990
- Part of my private.
- She ain't part of mine.

150
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,423
I don't know her.

151
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:39,411
So, what's the mysterious part,
the way they died or the circumstances?

152
00:06:39,448 --> 00:06:41,163
I mean, did you find him
with a noose around his neck

153
00:06:41,197 --> 00:06:42,781
and you didn't quite
know how it got there,

154
00:06:42,816 --> 00:06:44,870
or did he drown in his bed,
but the sheets were all dry?

155
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,361
- You're obsessed.
- Am I?

156
00:06:46,575 --> 00:06:48,473
Do you think dying
has made me morbid?

157
00:06:48,496 --> 00:06:49,530
Come on.

158
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,000
- How did the somebody die?
- Said it felt like life

159
00:06:52,035 --> 00:06:54,132
just got up and left him,
like I'm gonna get up and leave you.

160
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,610
Do you know what it could be?

161
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:56,881
It could be one of those
untraceable poisons,

162
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,493
or a four-stage poison,

163
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:00,090
when you have to,
like, touch four things

164
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,823
before it actually kills the person.
It could be that.

165
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,262
What did you say it
was besides mysterious?

166
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:08,353
I have not yet
expressed my opinion.

167
00:07:08,475 --> 00:07:10,023
Would you care to
express it now?

168
00:07:10,058 --> 00:07:11,533
My opinion is,
you need to take a coupon

169
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:14,022
for this conversation and
redeem it at another date.

170
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,601
- I want to use my coupon now.
- Redeem it tomorrow.

171
00:07:17,105 --> 00:07:20,201
There's somebody in the county
fridge I need you to talk to...

172
00:07:25,908 --> 00:07:27,942
In private-- My private--

173
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,702
which doesn't include her,
so she better not come.

174
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:38,333
I can write a book
on hand moisturizer.

175
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,602
Nobody wants the last thing
they've been touched with

176
00:07:40,636 --> 00:07:42,920
to be ashy and dry.
Take a gander.

177
00:07:43,927 --> 00:07:45,043
Smooth.

178
00:07:45,348 --> 00:07:48,133
You got some serious
cracks going on there.

179
00:07:48,347 --> 00:07:49,673
Put those up here.

180
00:07:55,935 --> 00:07:57,183
Hi.

181
00:07:58,147 --> 00:08:00,352
Thought you just came
by to say "hello."

182
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:03,601
You won't even know I'm here.

183
00:08:03,857 --> 00:08:04,940
'Cause you leaving?

184
00:08:05,238 --> 00:08:06,401
- No.
- Come on.

185
00:08:06,577 --> 00:08:07,692
It makes her happy.

186
00:08:07,947 --> 00:08:10,002
You remember what that
happiness looks like.

187
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:11,203
Redeem your coupon.

188
00:08:13,325 --> 00:08:15,022
Oh, now you're
gonna listen to me.

189
00:08:15,206 --> 00:08:16,411
No, no, no, no, no, no.

190
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,093
I ain't gonna say another word.

191
00:08:18,127 --> 00:08:19,880
"Future me," though,
is going, "I told you so,"

192
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:21,780
up one side of you and
down the other one,

193
00:08:21,818 --> 00:08:24,242
but "now me" is just
gonna sit back and watch.

194
00:08:34,978 --> 00:08:35,933
Oh, no.

195
00:08:36,146 --> 00:08:37,433
"Oh, no," what?

196
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:39,031
<i>The facts were these--</i>

197
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:40,361
<i>cunning and corrupt</i>

198
00:08:40,397 --> 00:08:42,401
<i>Lawrence Schatz was
a funeral director</i>

199
00:08:42,435 --> 00:08:44,031
<i>who made a living
off the dead</i>

200
00:08:44,068 --> 00:08:46,203
<i>above and beyond his
job description.</i>

201
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:49,652
<i>2 days, 8 hours,
and 43 minutes before his death,</i>

202
00:08:49,866 --> 00:08:52,113
<i>he was exposed as
a grave robber.</i>

203
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:55,320
Oh. I-I was just prepping
the body for burial.

204
00:08:55,746 --> 00:08:58,282
Your wife's gorgeous.
How did you guys meet?

205
00:08:58,387 --> 00:09:00,831
<i>But before any legal
action could be taken</i>

206
00:09:00,918 --> 00:09:03,682
<i>and before the spoils of his
grave-robbing could be found,</i>

207
00:09:03,715 --> 00:09:07,752
<i>Lawrence Schatz found himself in
the wrong place at the wrong time.</i>

208
00:09:08,046 --> 00:09:11,963
<i>He was 44 years, 17 months, 10 days,
6 hours, and 9 minutes old</i>

209
00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:15,763
<i>when he was in approximate
proximity of the pie maker.</i>

210
00:09:19,055 --> 00:09:21,392
<i>But keep his sleeping
beauty alive</i>

211
00:09:21,647 --> 00:09:23,893
<i>meant that someone
else had to die.</i>

212
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:26,480
What if you didn't
have to be dead?

213
00:09:26,735 --> 00:09:28,403
<i>And one minute later,</i>

214
00:09:28,737 --> 00:09:30,480
<i>the pie maker
took a life...</i>

215
00:09:30,827 --> 00:09:32,941
<i>...And gave it to
someone else.</i>

216
00:09:33,195 --> 00:09:35,611
- Why are you running away?
- Vertigo-- dizzy.

217
00:09:35,788 --> 00:09:37,583
The room started spinning,
and I, uh--

218
00:09:37,615 --> 00:09:39,550
I think it's my shoes.
They're, uh, stiff,

219
00:09:39,588 --> 00:09:41,412
and they pinch, and I, uh--

220
00:09:41,585 --> 00:09:43,300
I think they're cutting
off my circulation.

221
00:09:43,337 --> 00:09:45,431
That was mean.
That was a very mean thing you did.

222
00:09:45,466 --> 00:09:47,411
Really? 'Cause "future
me" is here now,

223
00:09:47,547 --> 00:09:49,393
- and he's got something to say.
- But you didn't touch him.

224
00:09:49,428 --> 00:09:51,720
How are we supposed to
find out who killed him

225
00:09:51,805 --> 00:09:52,983
- if you didn't touch him?
- Already know who killed him.

226
00:09:53,018 --> 00:09:54,730
So the mysterious part
is how he was killed.

227
00:09:54,767 --> 00:09:56,011
Already know that, too.

228
00:09:56,088 --> 00:09:58,152
Okay, how was he killed,
and who was the killer?

229
00:09:58,188 --> 00:09:59,762
Yeah? Who was the killer?

230
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:01,530
<i>The pie maker's
eye twitched</i>

231
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:04,243
<i>in anticipation of the
lie he was about to tell,</i>

232
00:10:04,276 --> 00:10:05,350
<i>but, instead,</i>

233
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,353
<i>what he told
was the truth.</i>

234
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:09,310
- Me.
- What?

235
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:12,362
You killed someone?

236
00:10:15,568 --> 00:10:16,660
Who did you kill?

237
00:10:16,697 --> 00:10:19,243
- I didn't.
- You didn't-- that's why somebody died.

238
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,451
Please stop talking.

239
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,373
- You didn't what?
- Looky here,

240
00:10:22,585 --> 00:10:24,300
you need a ticket
to ride this ride.

241
00:10:24,338 --> 00:10:25,550
If your ticket gets punched,

242
00:10:25,585 --> 00:10:27,470
then you got to take
somebody else's ticket.

243
00:10:27,505 --> 00:10:29,342
- Why are you still talking?
- I'm ripping off the band-aid.

244
00:10:29,377 --> 00:10:31,050
I'm not a ripper--
I pull up a corner a little at a time,

245
00:10:31,087 --> 00:10:33,182
then I run it under warm water,
and I pull it up a little more.

246
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,712
- It's a process.
- Let it rip.

247
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,440
I didn't actively kill.
I'm not an active killer.

248
00:10:37,477 --> 00:10:38,883
I'm not a killer.

249
00:10:39,685 --> 00:10:42,640
- You killed someone for me?
- It wasn't my fault.

250
00:10:42,898 --> 00:10:44,390
It's a random proximity thing.

251
00:10:44,606 --> 00:10:47,102
There was no choice or
decision-making whatsoever.

252
00:10:47,275 --> 00:10:49,943
- It just happened.
- But you knew it would happen.

253
00:10:50,156 --> 00:10:52,603
I was incapacitated with
not being able to think.

254
00:10:52,815 --> 00:10:54,790
I had one thought in my head,
and it was of you,

255
00:10:54,825 --> 00:10:56,962
and it clogged me up so no other
thoughts could get through,

256
00:10:56,998 --> 00:10:58,623
including the one telling
me to touch you again.

257
00:10:58,655 --> 00:11:00,080
So every minute I've
been celebrating

258
00:11:00,115 --> 00:11:01,953
wasn't really mine
to celebrate.

259
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:05,080
<i>As Chuck considered the
life she was living</i>

260
00:11:05,296 --> 00:11:06,791
<i>that was not her own...</i>

261
00:11:07,295 --> 00:11:10,080
<i>...Olive considered the
life she was not living.</i>

262
00:11:10,296 --> 00:11:11,690
Might I make an observation?

263
00:11:11,886 --> 00:11:14,430
- Compliment or criticism?
- A neutral thought, I would say.

264
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:16,461
It's neither complimentary
nor critical.

265
00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:19,301
Neutral thought gives me pause.

266
00:11:19,517 --> 00:11:22,012
Neutral for only this
portion of the conversation,

267
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:23,900
but I do have
complimentary observations

268
00:11:23,936 --> 00:11:26,320
as part of a follow-up discussion,
which I intend

269
00:11:26,357 --> 00:11:28,452
to headline with an offer to
repair your espresso machine.

270
00:11:28,485 --> 00:11:30,571
- What's your neutral thought?
- You deem decidedly unhappy.

271
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,102
- I haven't decided that.
- No anxieties, neuroses,

272
00:11:33,196 --> 00:11:34,822
- pathologies?
- Garden variety.

273
00:11:35,156 --> 00:11:37,452
- What are you beating at?
- I'm beating at happiness.

274
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,073
I've beaten it into submission

275
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,152
and bottled it for convenience.

276
00:11:44,707 --> 00:11:46,162
It's homeopathic.

277
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,493
Meaning it deeply
relates to gay people.

278
00:11:48,548 --> 00:11:50,790
"Gay" only in that they
are bright and happy.

279
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,351
You never have to worry about the
oxygen leaving the room again.

280
00:11:53,387 --> 00:11:55,541
Don't go bothering the
customers with this.

281
00:11:55,847 --> 00:11:58,510
This is a pie house,
not some herbal crack den.

282
00:12:01,098 --> 00:12:02,842
Chuck, say something.

283
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:04,862
I can't, for the life of me,
think of anything to say.

284
00:12:04,897 --> 00:12:07,090
Oh, I forgot--
it's not even my life, is it?

285
00:12:19,535 --> 00:12:20,782
Not now.

286
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,953
I feel violated.

287
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,660
That was my information.

288
00:12:26,918 --> 00:12:29,212
There's your information,
and then there's my information.

289
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,542
That was our information.

290
00:12:30,576 --> 00:12:33,573
You let a man die on our time,
a man who could have been me.

291
00:12:33,716 --> 00:12:35,262
- It wasn't.
- But it could have been.

292
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:36,681
That was a business
associate of mine.

293
00:12:36,717 --> 00:12:38,683
Who do you think hooked
us up with corpse bride?

294
00:12:38,718 --> 00:12:40,462
But he stole stuff
off dead people.

295
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:42,230
Regardless of how he
ran his own business,

296
00:12:42,266 --> 00:12:43,773
he never interfered
with how I ran mine.

297
00:12:43,807 --> 00:12:45,812
You, on the other hand,
made me an accomplice to a murder.

298
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,611
Stop saying that.
I didn't murder anyone.

299
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:48,901
There was no malice
or forethought.

300
00:12:48,938 --> 00:12:50,060
Okay, maybe

301
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:52,182
accidental,
involuntary manslaughter.

302
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:56,810
Oh, you accidentally,
involuntarily let dead girl live?

303
00:12:58,157 --> 00:13:00,231
That's what I thought
you was gonna say.

304
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,070
Lawrence Schatz was murdered
enough for his brother

305
00:13:02,106 --> 00:13:04,153
to hire me to find
out who killed him.

306
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,950
- Why did you take this case?
- You want me to take this case.

307
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:10,453
I'm making sure nobody
else solves it.

308
00:13:10,747 --> 00:13:13,240
Look, I didn't want to go
down this road with you.

309
00:13:13,298 --> 00:13:14,591
I'm sensitive to
your experience.

310
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,980
I understand that
it's traumatic.

311
00:13:16,015 --> 00:13:17,973
But now I need to chat
with Lawrence Schatz

312
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:20,252
before he goes into
the ground tomorrow.

313
00:13:20,427 --> 00:13:21,931
I'm not going back to
that funeral home.

314
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,142
It's returning to the scene of a crime--
that's just sloppy.

315
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:25,773
And by the way,
to ask him what?

316
00:13:25,845 --> 00:13:27,222
I want to ask
Lawrence what he did

317
00:13:27,258 --> 00:13:29,150
with all those precious
family heirlooms.

318
00:13:29,187 --> 00:13:30,602
So you can...

319
00:13:31,017 --> 00:13:35,023
return it to the families
and help heal the grieving?

320
00:13:35,358 --> 00:13:39,153
Yeah, 'cause after the grieving stops,
you have Joy,

321
00:13:39,368 --> 00:13:40,733
and with Joy comes money,

322
00:13:40,947 --> 00:13:44,490
and Louis Schatz will stop asking
questions about how his brother died.

323
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:49,240
I'm not touching Lawrence Schatz.
It's too traumatic.

324
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,622
I am fragile on this issue.

325
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:53,622
- That how it is?
- Yeah.

326
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,293
That's how it is.

327
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:58,792
Whatever you say... killer.

328
00:13:59,846 --> 00:14:02,631
<i>The pie maker
rationalized circumstances</i>

329
00:14:02,668 --> 00:14:06,223
<i>beyond his control were responsible
for Lawrence Schatz's death.</i>

330
00:14:06,438 --> 00:14:07,842
<i>He was not to blame.</i>

331
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:10,512
<i>Rationalizing those
rationalizations</i>

332
00:14:10,895 --> 00:14:12,943
<i>to the man he
inadvertently killed</i>

333
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:14,863
<i>was something he'd
rather not do.</i>

334
00:14:14,898 --> 00:14:16,443
I want to talk to Louis Schatz.

335
00:14:17,105 --> 00:14:19,193
I want you to talk to him, too.

336
00:14:21,446 --> 00:14:23,361
Why would I do that?

337
00:14:23,438 --> 00:14:25,903
So you can apologize,
and I can say "thank you."

338
00:14:29,665 --> 00:14:33,410
<i>As the pie maker found himself
back at the scene of his crime,</i>

339
00:14:33,467 --> 00:14:36,873
<i>Chuck found herself back
where her second life began,</i>

340
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,581
<i>now with the understanding
of how it began.</i>

341
00:14:44,805 --> 00:14:46,300
Have you already been here?

342
00:14:48,475 --> 00:14:50,840
- Lawrence Schatz?
- Louis.

343
00:14:50,855 --> 00:14:52,050
Lawrence is dead.

344
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,761
- Hey, Emerson.
- Hey, Louie.

345
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,810
"Darling Mermaid Darlings."

346
00:14:56,027 --> 00:14:57,570
Yeah, we just
buried their niece,

347
00:14:57,608 --> 00:14:59,203
lonely tourist
Charlotte Charles.

348
00:14:59,235 --> 00:15:01,412
- You see they're on tour.
- I do. It's so exciting.

349
00:15:01,446 --> 00:15:03,590
Tour was canceled.
They're in a dark place,

350
00:15:03,775 --> 00:15:06,411
some kind of an emotional relapse.
Have we met before?

351
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:07,740
- No.
- No.

352
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,131
<i>The cause of the Darling
Mermaid Darlings'</i>

353
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,032
<i>emotional relapse
was this...</i>

354
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:15,291
<i>After losing Chuck,</i>

355
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:18,182
<i>aunts Lily and Vivian had
a better appreciation</i>

356
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,960
<i>of the preciousness
of life.</i>

357
00:15:20,178 --> 00:15:22,302
<i>With luggage packed,
bonnets cinched,</i>

358
00:15:22,335 --> 00:15:24,331
<i>and sunscreen
vigorously applied,</i>

359
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,503
<i>they were ready
at last to start</i>

360
00:15:26,596 --> 00:15:28,801
<i>their long-awaited
comeback tour,</i>

361
00:15:29,016 --> 00:15:31,262
<i>but not today.
To their surprise,</i>

362
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,650
<i>there was something waiting
in the morning mail,</i>

363
00:15:33,687 --> 00:15:36,471
<i>alongside the thrifty
nickel and the pennysaver.</i>

364
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,062
It's from Charlotte.

365
00:15:38,315 --> 00:15:39,641
<i>In that moment,</i>

366
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,313
<i>only for a moment,</i>

367
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,690
<i>aunt Lily forgot
Chuck was dead...</i>

368
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,942
<i>or, at least,
dead to her.</i>

369
00:15:46,157 --> 00:15:47,570
<i>Then she remembered.</i>

370
00:15:52,287 --> 00:15:54,410
Poor, poor Charlotte.

371
00:15:55,535 --> 00:15:57,081
<i>And with that,</i>

372
00:15:57,306 --> 00:15:59,041
<i>the Darling
Mermaid Darlings</i>

373
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,042
<i>cancelled their
comeback tour.</i>

374
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:03,322
I'm having a martini
and going to bed.

375
00:16:06,637 --> 00:16:08,053
You know, uh, Larry died

376
00:16:08,307 --> 00:16:10,692
on the same day we buried lonely
tourist Charlotte Charles.

377
00:16:10,728 --> 00:16:13,593
- We don't often bury a celebrity.
- Celebrity.

378
00:16:13,936 --> 00:16:16,022
Burying a celebrity,
even a pseudo-celebrity,

379
00:16:16,057 --> 00:16:17,610
who's only famous
for how she died,

380
00:16:17,646 --> 00:16:19,441
must be a coup for any funeral home,
I'd imagine.

381
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,601
It would be,

382
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,193
if it wasn't for Larry's
grave-robbing scandal

383
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,482
or his murder.

384
00:16:25,155 --> 00:16:26,482
He's in here.

385
00:16:27,076 --> 00:16:30,111
I got it locked,
so no one can defile his dead body.

386
00:16:30,327 --> 00:16:31,772
Are you sure he was murdered?

387
00:16:31,997 --> 00:16:33,693
I've been putting
it all together.

388
00:16:33,788 --> 00:16:36,783
And, boy,
do I have a tale to tell.

389
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,420
<i>And this is the tale
Louis Schatz told.</i>

390
00:16:39,757 --> 00:16:42,150
<i>He detailed a series
of events that began</i>

391
00:16:42,255 --> 00:16:44,921
<i>when he caught
his brother ***</i>

392
00:16:45,176 --> 00:16:47,013
I was just prepping
the body for burial.

393
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,920
Your wife's gorgeous.
How'd you meet?

394
00:16:49,215 --> 00:16:51,222
Aw, Larry. How could you?

395
00:16:51,518 --> 00:16:53,961
<i>When word of Lawrence's
grave-robbing ways</i>

396
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,653
<i>spread through the sleepy
hollow of Coeur d'Coeurs,</i>

397
00:16:56,686 --> 00:16:58,313
<i>there was
public outrage.</i>

398
00:16:58,605 --> 00:17:01,521
<i>Bulk hate mail and death
threats by the hundreds</i>

399
00:17:01,535 --> 00:17:03,733
<i>frightened the truth
out of Lawrence.</i>

400
00:17:03,896 --> 00:17:05,191
<i>According to Louis,</i>

401
00:17:05,238 --> 00:17:06,880
<i>he only confessed
his sins</i>

402
00:17:06,945 --> 00:17:09,372
<i>to the one person he
knew would forgive him.</i>

403
00:17:09,406 --> 00:17:12,242
I buried it all where
no one could find it.

404
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,090
You have to give
everything back.

405
00:17:14,205 --> 00:17:15,861
But I buried it really deep.

406
00:17:16,116 --> 00:17:19,260
<i>Louis insisted what his brother
Lawrence did not confess</i>

407
00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:23,003
<i>was where he had hidden the
spoils of his grave-robbery.</i>

408
00:17:23,795 --> 00:17:26,333
<i>That secret he took
to his own grave</i>

409
00:17:26,637 --> 00:17:29,130
<i>when he presumably died
of heart failure.</i>

410
00:17:29,426 --> 00:17:31,921
<i>But as Louis was besieged
by angry families</i>

411
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:34,310
<i>seeking the return of
stolen heirlooms,</i>

412
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:35,840
<i>he began to wonder--</i>

413
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:38,141
<i>What if it wasn't
heart failure?</i>

414
00:17:38,397 --> 00:17:40,432
<i>What if his brother
was murdered?</i>

415
00:17:40,645 --> 00:17:43,783
<i>What if, in the hundreds of letters
addressed to Lawrence Schatz,</i>

416
00:17:43,818 --> 00:17:46,813
<i>threatening his life,
one of them was a promise?</i>

417
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:50,480
<i>What if his brother
was murdered,</i>

418
00:17:50,775 --> 00:17:52,900
<i>and what if his
murder was next?</i>

419
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,783
I told Larry it was bad karma.

420
00:17:54,997 --> 00:17:57,091
The whole thing makes me sick--
just sick.

421
00:17:57,116 --> 00:17:58,842
Do you know what it's like
to live in daily fear

422
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,420
that one minute
you could drop dead

423
00:18:00,456 --> 00:18:03,802
right where you're standing because
of something somebody else did?

424
00:18:03,835 --> 00:18:06,210
I feel like I could
smoke a cigar with you.

425
00:18:06,425 --> 00:18:08,083
I don't smoke. That was Larry.

426
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:11,300
Here. Take it. He would.

427
00:18:12,927 --> 00:18:14,883
It's true what they
say about twins--

428
00:18:15,175 --> 00:18:17,691
His life was my life.
It's strange to share someone's life.

429
00:18:17,726 --> 00:18:19,510
I feel like mine's tainted now.

430
00:18:19,726 --> 00:18:21,671
I would love to give
back what he took.

431
00:18:21,897 --> 00:18:23,572
Can we have a moment
to pay our respects,

432
00:18:23,607 --> 00:18:26,103
while you go rustle up
that hate mail to go?

433
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:30,863
Yeah.

434
00:18:35,285 --> 00:18:38,743
<i>As they stood over the man
who died for one of them</i>

435
00:18:38,807 --> 00:18:40,552
<i>and was killed
by the other,</i>

436
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,283
<i>Chuck and the pie maker</i>

437
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:44,300
<i>carefully planned
their words.</i>

438
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,843
- Yes?
- I'm sorry for what I did.

439
00:18:49,908 --> 00:18:52,750
It was mostly an accident,
but partially on purpose.

440
00:18:53,005 --> 00:18:55,052
However inadvertent,
I am sorry I did it.

441
00:18:56,317 --> 00:18:57,513
That's all.

442
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:00,763
Hello.

443
00:19:01,146 --> 00:19:03,140
Lonely tourist
Charlotte Charles,

444
00:19:03,438 --> 00:19:05,281
are you part of my
welcoming committee?

445
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:07,321
More like a beneficiary,
in that I'm still alive,

446
00:19:07,358 --> 00:19:09,900
- which is why you're not.
- Am I a human sacrifice?

447
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:11,941
- Hey, Emerson.
- Oh, hey, Larry.

448
00:19:12,237 --> 00:19:14,702
What'd you do with all that stuff
you stole off them dead people?

449
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,461
Why don't you ask Louis
what he did with it?

450
00:19:16,498 --> 00:19:18,120
- Louis said you buried it.
- And you believed him.

451
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,951
You met Louis?
Hey, how did I die?

452
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,092
Did somebody kill me?
Hey, did Louis kill me?

453
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:24,420
- Nobody killed you, per se.
- Y-yes, they did.

454
00:19:24,548 --> 00:19:25,940
It was so that I could live.

455
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:27,552
It wasn't personal.
I didn't pick you.

456
00:19:27,585 --> 00:19:28,933
The selection is purely random,

457
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:30,761
but it didn't help that
you were in the next room.

458
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:32,301
Louis has all that
stuff you stole?

459
00:19:32,335 --> 00:19:34,131
We stole--
it was a family business.

460
00:19:34,345 --> 00:19:36,060
Louis has everything
but this watch.

461
00:19:36,095 --> 00:19:37,891
My dad gave me a
watch just like that.

462
00:19:37,925 --> 00:19:40,441
You were buried with it.
Well, you were supposed to be.

463
00:19:40,478 --> 00:19:41,870
Caught me in the cookie jar.

464
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:44,102
You stole that
off my dead body?

465
00:19:44,358 --> 00:19:46,603
Your dead body wasn't
doing anything with it.

466
00:19:46,857 --> 00:19:48,272
Hey, what are you doing?

467
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,060
It's stuck.

468
00:19:52,445 --> 00:19:54,861
- You better be playing.
- 29 seconds.

469
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,863
Oh, hell, no!

470
00:20:06,376 --> 00:20:08,831
<i>One minute's time
was nearing its end.</i>

471
00:20:08,966 --> 00:20:11,171
<i>Random selection
was about to begin.</i>

472
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,752
5 seconds!

473
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,180
Maybe I should let him
have his life back.

474
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:17,800
Not how it works.

475
00:20:18,097 --> 00:20:20,250
No regifting!

476
00:20:21,438 --> 00:20:22,890
That wasn't cool, you guys.

477
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:33,650
Look.

478
00:20:34,987 --> 00:20:37,982
Aw, that was so sweet of my
aunts to bury it with me.

479
00:20:39,286 --> 00:20:41,570
My dad had it,
and then I had it.

480
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:44,321
Then I suppose he had it,
which really steams me.

481
00:20:44,705 --> 00:20:46,781
- You got it back?
- Yeah, I did.

482
00:20:48,495 --> 00:20:50,293
It's nice to get things back.

483
00:20:52,007 --> 00:20:54,581
My aunts cancelled their tour.

484
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:58,550
I was really looking forward
to hiding out in the crowd

485
00:20:58,586 --> 00:21:00,651
with a big pair of
sunglasses and a parasol,

486
00:21:00,687 --> 00:21:02,931
watching them perform
in their mermaid suits.

487
00:21:05,645 --> 00:21:07,511
He said they were
in a dark place.

488
00:21:07,765 --> 00:21:10,161
He said they had some kind
of emotional relapse.

489
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:14,351
- Couldn't we just...
- You can't see your aunts.

490
00:21:15,946 --> 00:21:17,273
I'm sorry.

491
00:21:24,665 --> 00:21:27,701
<i>If Chuck could not regift
the life she'd been given,</i>

492
00:21:27,796 --> 00:21:29,851
<i>she at least wanted to
find a way to share it</i>

493
00:21:29,886 --> 00:21:32,250
<i>with her aunts
Lily and Vivian.</i>

494
00:21:37,967 --> 00:21:40,173
Anybody dead back there
that shouldn't be?

495
00:21:40,428 --> 00:21:41,422
No.

496
00:21:41,965 --> 00:21:43,133
Sweet.

497
00:21:44,307 --> 00:21:47,553
<i>After Lawrence Schatz was
exposed as a grave robber,</i>

498
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:50,020
<i>the mailbox at the Schatz
brothers funeral home</i>

499
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:54,020
<i>received 1,867
hate letters,</i>

500
00:21:54,118 --> 00:21:57,733
<i>each one a catalog of heirlooms
feared stolen or lost.</i>

501
00:21:57,947 --> 00:21:59,730
Louis Schatz is a big,
fat liar.

502
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:02,321
And I say "fat" in reference
to his size as a liar,

503
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:04,250
not as a judgment of
his physical appearance.

504
00:22:04,285 --> 00:22:05,731
I'm not mad at him for lying.

505
00:22:05,955 --> 00:22:08,490
If I could pin my crimes
on some dead relative,

506
00:22:08,505 --> 00:22:11,700
especially some guilty dead relative,
I'd certainly consider it.

507
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:14,041
That sucker played me
like boo-boo the fool--

508
00:22:14,087 --> 00:22:15,882
Hiring me to make
him look innocent.

509
00:22:16,008 --> 00:22:18,683
He knew all along where that
dead-people treasure was buried.

510
00:22:18,715 --> 00:22:19,861
It's all right, though.

511
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:23,060
I'm gonna follow his lying fat
ass until he lead me right to it.

512
00:22:23,095 --> 00:22:24,343
Then I'm gonna take it.

513
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:27,603
- You can't steal dead people's stuff.
- I'm not the one who stole it.

514
00:22:27,636 --> 00:22:30,641
I don't condone what they did,
but it's once removed now.

515
00:22:30,897 --> 00:22:33,113
I'm not the pirate--
I'm just looking for treasure.

516
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:35,430
- The pirate metaphore is weak.
- It's apt.

517
00:22:35,738 --> 00:22:37,823
I find a dead pirate treasure
at the bottom of the sea,

518
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:39,490
I take it--
doesn't matter whose it was,

519
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,790
if whose it was is dead,
'cause it's mine now.

520
00:22:41,826 --> 00:22:43,280
This-- this isn't a doubloon.

521
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:44,932
This is somebody's something.

522
00:22:45,116 --> 00:22:47,370
Stealing from a pirate who
already stole is still stealing.

523
00:22:47,405 --> 00:22:48,662
It's not once removed.

524
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,421
Somebody didn't
want that something

525
00:22:50,455 --> 00:22:52,540
if they buried it with
somebody who can't use it.

526
00:22:52,578 --> 00:22:54,923
What if Lawrence Schatz was
murdered for this buried treasure?

527
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:57,001
Well, was gonna be
before you got to him.

528
00:22:57,046 --> 00:22:58,513
Why'd you have to
say it like that?

529
00:22:58,546 --> 00:23:00,390
There's a lot of hostility
in these letters.

530
00:23:00,428 --> 00:23:03,351
Do you realize how angry someone
has to be to put pen to paper?

531
00:23:03,387 --> 00:23:04,931
I mean,
these people are furious.

532
00:23:04,965 --> 00:23:06,522
Any one of them
could be the killer.

533
00:23:06,555 --> 00:23:08,222
Lawrence Schatz
wasn't murdered.

534
00:23:08,476 --> 00:23:12,141
He was accidentally,
involuntarily manslaughtered.

535
00:23:12,397 --> 00:23:14,592
- I appreciate that.
- There ain't no killer.

536
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:19,271
<i>***</i>

537
00:23:19,367 --> 00:23:21,902
<i>murder was on
someone's mind.</i>

538
00:23:26,785 --> 00:23:29,382
<i>As Chuck catalogued
another missing heirloom,</i>

539
00:23:29,406 --> 00:23:31,701
<i>she considered what
her aunts had lost</i>

540
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:34,052
<i>and how it could
never be returned.</i>

541
00:23:34,286 --> 00:23:35,662
This is depressing.

542
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,792
Did you say "depressing"?

543
00:23:47,177 --> 00:23:50,302
FDA-approved
pharmaceutical-grade herbology.

544
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:52,142
Like a bully for your emotions.

545
00:23:52,226 --> 00:23:54,530
Emotions need to be bullied,
or at least groomed.

546
00:23:54,568 --> 00:23:57,443
Indulging depression is like
indulging a horrible, willful child.

547
00:23:57,476 --> 00:23:58,691
If you allow it
to run roughshod,

548
00:23:58,727 --> 00:24:00,992
you'll find yourself
catering to its every whim.

549
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:02,490
So, bully it,
and bully it good.

550
00:24:02,527 --> 00:24:04,371
Everyone needs to be
bullied sometimes.

551
00:24:04,408 --> 00:24:05,750
Do you have any literature?

552
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:08,000
I have a pamphlet,
if you'd like to read that.

553
00:24:08,037 --> 00:24:09,922
Our herbs for depression
contain proven ingredients

554
00:24:09,957 --> 00:24:12,550
in the proper doses,
manufactured with the strictest

555
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,873
- of quality control.
- "Herbs for depression" sounds

556
00:24:14,905 --> 00:24:17,562
- so much more civil than "antidepressants."
- And with fewer side effects.

557
00:24:17,595 --> 00:24:19,550
- Can I have these?
- I can't just give it to you.

558
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:20,980
It's a controlled substance.

559
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:23,540
But I have a sample pack.

560
00:24:26,385 --> 00:24:28,553
<i>Chuck wasn't thinking
of herself.</i>

561
00:24:28,886 --> 00:24:30,730
<i>She was thinking
of her aunts.</i>

562
00:24:32,595 --> 00:24:35,472
<i>Though her life she was
living was not her own</i>

563
00:24:35,685 --> 00:24:37,881
<i>Chuck found a way
for her living gift</i>

564
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,351
<i>to be the gift
that kept giving.</i>

565
00:24:40,816 --> 00:24:44,693
<i>She took responsibility for
Lily and Vivian's happiness.</i>

566
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:46,152
<i>And took action.</i>

567
00:25:01,546 --> 00:25:03,830
<i>Even after she was
dead and gone,</i>

568
00:25:04,015 --> 00:25:07,160
<i>Chuck found a way to do what
she had done all her life--</i>

569
00:25:07,345 --> 00:25:09,092
<i>Care for her aunts.</i>

570
00:25:12,518 --> 00:25:15,222
- Oh, you forgot one.
- Outside my zone.

571
00:25:15,435 --> 00:25:16,931
Oh, it's not so far.

572
00:25:17,228 --> 00:25:19,771
Do you want to be a delivery
boy or a delivery man?

573
00:25:19,815 --> 00:25:21,433
Boy. You be a man.

574
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,892
But it's my day off.

575
00:25:24,355 --> 00:25:25,811
And I'm a girl!

576
00:25:26,155 --> 00:25:27,360
<i>In her own way,</i>

577
00:25:27,696 --> 00:25:30,780
<i>Olive identified with the
plight of the abandoned pie.</i>

578
00:25:31,076 --> 00:25:33,843
<i>It was meant for someone,
and without a little effort,</i>

579
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:37,160
<i>it would never be with the
one it was meant to be with.</i>

580
00:25:38,497 --> 00:25:40,581
<i>And tragically
for Louis Schatz,</i>

581
00:25:40,876 --> 00:25:43,413
<i>he was meant to be
with his brother.</i>

582
00:25:53,926 --> 00:25:56,021
Hey, I didn't hear you
leave this morning.

583
00:25:56,267 --> 00:25:58,112
I didn't hear you
come in last night.

584
00:25:58,357 --> 00:26:00,473
I was having
conversations with myself.

585
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:02,132
What did you guys talk about?

586
00:26:02,398 --> 00:26:04,593
I asked myself,
"if I were storming a castle

587
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:06,911
to save a Sleeping Beauty
from the jaws of death,

588
00:26:06,946 --> 00:26:09,621
and in the melee,
my sword of truth flew swift and sure

589
00:26:09,655 --> 00:26:11,292
and killed an unfortunate
outlaw huddled nearby,

590
00:26:11,326 --> 00:26:12,990
how would I feel?"

591
00:26:13,327 --> 00:26:15,332
Did you successfully
rescue Sleeping Beauty?

592
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:16,530
In this scenario, yeah.

593
00:26:16,865 --> 00:26:18,812
And how would you
feel, hypothetically?

594
00:26:18,825 --> 00:26:20,970
I'd feel happy and then bad,
and primarily happy,

595
00:26:21,006 --> 00:26:23,043
and then I'd think
about it too much,

596
00:26:23,255 --> 00:26:24,651
and then I'd feel bad again.

597
00:26:24,915 --> 00:26:27,290
That's kind of how I
feel/exactly how I feel.

598
00:26:30,136 --> 00:26:32,501
Well, I don't want you
to think I'm a killer.

599
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,812
I don't want to think
you're a killer, either.

600
00:26:34,848 --> 00:26:36,942
I want to think of you
as Prince Charming.

601
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,922
I'm not setting a standard
for you to live up to.

602
00:26:39,938 --> 00:26:41,970
- It's just--
- That's not good.

603
00:26:46,358 --> 00:26:50,482
- Did you-- did you--
- No. No!

604
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:52,623
<i>As Chuck and the pie
maker considered</i>

605
00:26:52,658 --> 00:26:54,951
<i>the dead Schatz brother
in the freezer,</i>

606
00:26:55,327 --> 00:26:58,100
<i>Olive snook considered
the consequences</i>

607
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,951
<i>of driving several
towns away</i>

608
00:27:00,247 --> 00:27:01,750
<i>to make a delivery
to an address</i>

609
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,790
<i>that was not part of the
regular delivery route.</i>

610
00:27:26,996 --> 00:27:29,482
<i>As she drew closer
to the front door,</i>

611
00:27:29,777 --> 00:27:32,272
<i>Olive considered the
sheer number of crimes</i>

612
00:27:32,307 --> 00:27:35,352
<i>against delivery people and
how they were on the rise.</i>

613
00:27:44,876 --> 00:27:48,793
S.O.S.! O.S.! O.S.! S.O.S.!

614
00:27:48,856 --> 00:27:51,543
This pie smells delicious.

615
00:27:56,678 --> 00:28:00,762
Pies for breakfast always
remind me of mother.

616
00:28:01,055 --> 00:28:02,973
Vermouth always
reminds me of mother.

617
00:28:03,106 --> 00:28:04,602
Why are we having pie,

618
00:28:04,897 --> 00:28:06,990
- and who the hell are you?
- Forgive Lily.

619
00:28:07,027 --> 00:28:09,872
The last time we had visitors,
there was a home invasion.

620
00:28:10,066 --> 00:28:11,811
That was all over
the evening news.

621
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,902
You're Darling Mermaid Darlings
Vivian and Lily Charles.

622
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:17,501
I saw you perform at the
Callum County Country Fair

623
00:28:17,616 --> 00:28:19,193
when I was a little girl.

624
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:23,492
Olive is in the pie industry.

625
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,161
Really?

626
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:27,541
Someone has made you
the happy recipients

627
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:30,001
of a pie from the Pie Hole,
as in "shut your."

628
00:28:30,297 --> 00:28:32,941
Or, in this case,
"open your," 'cause it's real good.

629
00:28:33,428 --> 00:28:36,673
The Pie Hole-- I like it.
It's provocative.

630
00:28:37,095 --> 00:28:39,970
Well, you must love pie to
make it your life's work.

631
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,631
Lots to love at the Pie Hole.

632
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,650
There's gruyère
baked into the crust.

633
00:28:43,687 --> 00:28:46,440
- Oh, I didn't even know we did that.
- Charlotte loved gruyère.

634
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:47,822
We recently lost our niece,

635
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:51,060
- lonely tourist Charlotte Charles.
- It's all over the news.

636
00:28:51,236 --> 00:28:52,853
I am so sorry for your loss.

637
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,580
I'm sure you're
sick of hearing it.

638
00:28:54,618 --> 00:28:56,560
I don't want to beat
a sentiment to d--

639
00:28:58,537 --> 00:29:00,991
I'm so sorry for your loss.

640
00:29:02,156 --> 00:29:04,032
This has to be from
that young man

641
00:29:04,048 --> 00:29:06,343
who lived next door when
Charlotte was a girl.

642
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:08,412
Oh, he had a filthy
mind as a child.

643
00:29:08,707 --> 00:29:11,622
He gave Charlotte a beaver
t-shirt for her 8th birthday.

644
00:29:12,258 --> 00:29:14,581
- What did we call him?
- "Beaver boy."

645
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:16,002
Beaver boy.

646
00:29:16,345 --> 00:29:18,311
Seems like he grew up
to be a nice young man.

647
00:29:18,347 --> 00:29:20,241
Beaver boy did say
he was a pie maker.

648
00:29:20,346 --> 00:29:22,242
I imagine he gives
lots of people pie.

649
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:23,801
Beaver boy's a pie maker?

650
00:29:24,098 --> 00:29:26,391
Who was childhood
sweethearts with your niece,

651
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:29,223
lonely tourist Charlotte Charles,
who is dead?

652
00:29:29,856 --> 00:29:31,182
Presently?

653
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:35,353
<i>The truth about the dead
girl who wasn't dead</i>

654
00:29:35,457 --> 00:29:37,151
<i>vibrated on
Olive's tongue.</i>

655
00:29:37,187 --> 00:29:40,030
<i>She dare not let it out,
so she took another bite.</i>

656
00:29:42,826 --> 00:29:45,862
<i>Not realizing Louis Schatz
was dead and wedged</i>

657
00:29:45,877 --> 00:29:48,300
<i>between chilling dough
and yesterday's eggs,</i>

658
00:29:48,336 --> 00:29:51,371
<i>Emerson Cod prepared to
monitor every move he made,</i>

659
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:53,583
<i>in hopes of finding
buried treasure.</i>

660
00:29:54,677 --> 00:29:57,753
- Hi, um, one of the Schatz brothers--
- It's Louis.

661
00:29:58,008 --> 00:30:00,242
Louis Schatz is in my freezer,
and I'm not sure how he got there,

662
00:30:00,277 --> 00:30:02,231
because it doesn't look
like it was his own doing,

663
00:30:02,266 --> 00:30:03,953
on account of he's
dead and all.

664
00:30:03,965 --> 00:30:05,663
- You being set up.
- He said we're being set up.

665
00:30:05,705 --> 00:30:07,450
Why would anyone
want to set us up?

666
00:30:07,477 --> 00:30:08,853
No, you being set up.

667
00:30:09,147 --> 00:30:11,322
- Why would anyone want to set me up?
- Hell if I know.

668
00:30:11,358 --> 00:30:13,283
Maybe they figure,
since you killed the other one...

669
00:30:13,318 --> 00:30:15,200
- Have I been exposed?
- Does somebody know?

670
00:30:15,238 --> 00:30:16,480
Somebody knows something,

671
00:30:16,655 --> 00:30:19,303
and that somebody probably
already called the police.

672
00:30:20,076 --> 00:30:22,733
Hey, the police are here.

673
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:35,793
Hi.

674
00:30:35,807 --> 00:30:37,331
You need to follow us.

675
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,223
- Where are we going?
- You're going to heaven.

676
00:30:39,256 --> 00:30:41,100
- I got in?
- Yeah, and heaven's closing

677
00:30:41,135 --> 00:30:42,852
- in like five minutes.
- Or one, actually.

678
00:30:42,896 --> 00:30:44,693
Heaven's closing in
like one minute.

679
00:30:57,698 --> 00:30:59,902
Hey, Emerson,
you going to heaven, too?

680
00:31:00,075 --> 00:31:02,333
- Yeah, we all going to heaven.
- That's so weird.

681
00:31:02,365 --> 00:31:04,660
- We died at the same time.
- Mm-hmm. The rapture.

682
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:06,453
- No way.
- Yes way.

683
00:31:07,827 --> 00:31:09,532
- Is Larry here?
- Yeah,

684
00:31:09,616 --> 00:31:11,660
he told us to ask you what
you did with all that stuff

685
00:31:11,696 --> 00:31:13,412
you stole off those dead folks.

686
00:31:13,797 --> 00:31:15,802
Yeah, but first,
you got to tell us who killed you.

687
00:31:15,838 --> 00:31:18,223
- Heaven would want to know.
- I choked on a piece of tongue.

688
00:31:18,256 --> 00:31:19,923
Yours or somebody else's?

689
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:23,300
<i>In this instance,
the tongue belonged to a cow.</i>

690
00:31:23,638 --> 00:31:26,520
<i>Although Louis Schatz had
been limiting his portions,</i>

691
00:31:26,556 --> 00:31:29,603
<i>they weren't so small they
couldn't block his windpipe</i>

692
00:31:29,845 --> 00:31:32,392
<i>when he was confronted
by an angry customer.</i>

693
00:31:35,937 --> 00:31:38,180
He said something about
a civil war heirloom.

694
00:31:38,277 --> 00:31:39,602
Then I lost consciousness.

695
00:31:39,986 --> 00:31:41,981
I usually cough it up
before I pass out.

696
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:44,502
- 5 seconds.
- There's no seat belts in this car.

697
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:45,791
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

698
00:31:45,807 --> 00:31:47,610
What did you do
with all that stuff

699
00:31:47,696 --> 00:31:49,811
you stole off
those dead... folk?

700
00:31:49,828 --> 00:31:51,283
Sorry.

701
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,133
What are we gonna
do with the body?

702
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:55,220
We're gonna put Schatz
back exactly where he died

703
00:31:55,255 --> 00:31:57,440
and show whoever this sucker
was who tried to frame you

704
00:31:57,477 --> 00:31:59,500
how a sucker gets framed.

705
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,353
- We don't know who this sucker is.
- Yes, we do--

706
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:02,753
Wilfred Woodruff.

707
00:32:03,177 --> 00:32:05,572
<i>In Chuck's cataloging
of heirlooms feared</i>

708
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:07,561
<i>stolen by
trusted professionals,</i>

709
00:32:07,596 --> 00:32:10,510
<i>she came across a particularly
angry death threat</i>

710
00:32:10,768 --> 00:32:12,892
<i>written by one
Wilfred Woodruff.</i>

711
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:16,433
<i>Mr. Woodruff claimed
a civil war heirloom,</i>

712
00:32:16,686 --> 00:32:18,983
<i>supposedly buried with
his grandfather,</i>

713
00:32:19,025 --> 00:32:21,061
<i>was offered in an
online auction,</i>

714
00:32:21,355 --> 00:32:23,953
<i>which was traced back to
the brothers Schatz.</i>

715
00:32:24,115 --> 00:32:27,123
<i>Mr. Woodruff clearly stated
in writing that punishment</i>

716
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:29,413
<i>for insulting the
Woodruff family honor</i>

717
00:32:29,446 --> 00:32:31,662
<i>in such a way was death.</i>

718
00:32:39,717 --> 00:32:42,041
- It's all locked up.
- What?

719
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,013
- I ain't gonna fit.
- You'll fit.

720
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,683
There's plenty of room.

721
00:33:00,397 --> 00:33:03,563
Oh, the window looked
bigger from up there.

722
00:33:11,746 --> 00:33:13,032
Are you stuck?

723
00:33:13,455 --> 00:33:15,202
- No.
- Yes, you are.

724
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:16,833
You're like winnie-the-pooh.

725
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:18,580
Give me your paws, pooh.

726
00:33:26,675 --> 00:33:28,380
You people stop pulling me!

727
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:38,850
Oh, this isn't good at all.

728
00:33:40,436 --> 00:33:44,310
What part of "do not resuscitate"
don't you people understand?

729
00:33:48,157 --> 00:33:50,481
Honey, did you
turn off the gas?

730
00:34:11,266 --> 00:34:12,973
Wilfred Woodruff?

731
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:17,013
<i>The pie maker considered
the choices he had made</i>

732
00:34:17,026 --> 00:34:19,072
<i>that brought him to
this very moment,</i>

733
00:34:19,108 --> 00:34:21,271
<i>a moment that
may be his last.</i>

734
00:34:22,607 --> 00:34:24,640
<i>The irony of
being struck down</i>

735
00:34:24,657 --> 00:34:26,531
<i>by the man who
murdered the twin</i>

736
00:34:26,578 --> 00:34:28,113
<i>of the man he killed</i>

737
00:34:28,407 --> 00:34:30,162
<i>was not lost on
the pie maker.</i>

738
00:34:30,196 --> 00:34:31,983
<i>Also not lost--
his agility.</i>

739
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:35,112
- Oh, my god!
- Oh, my god!

740
00:34:38,248 --> 00:34:41,391
- What's going on in there?!
- Wilfred Woodruff found his sword!

741
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:43,223
I propose to fight
it out on this line

742
00:34:43,256 --> 00:34:45,600
- if it takes all summer.
- What line? It's ***.

743
00:34:45,797 --> 00:34:47,501
You ***sses S.
Grant said that--

744
00:34:47,757 --> 00:34:49,453
Not all of it,
just the last part.

745
00:34:49,466 --> 00:34:50,842
Bad-luck missionary ridge--

746
00:34:51,138 --> 00:34:54,021
My great-great-great-great-grand
pappy fought proudly against him

747
00:34:54,057 --> 00:34:56,052
- ith this sword.
- Are you adopted?

748
00:34:56,436 --> 00:34:59,012
<i>Wilfred Woodruff
was not adopted.</i>

749
00:34:59,438 --> 00:35:02,180
<i>On a hot day in the
summer of 1863,</i>

750
00:35:02,516 --> 00:35:05,610
<i>Wilfred Woodruff's
great-great-great-great-grandfather,</i>

751
00:35:05,777 --> 00:35:09,901
<i>Phan Bing Wu, was laying track
for the Central Pacific Railroad.</i>

752
00:35:10,315 --> 00:35:13,190
<i>The decision was made
to find a better life.</i>

753
00:35:13,207 --> 00:35:15,320
<i>As the civil war
was still raging,</i>

754
00:35:15,378 --> 00:35:17,740
<i>the other men chose
to go northwest.</i>

755
00:35:18,368 --> 00:35:22,413
<i>Why Phan Bing Wu chose to
run southeast is not known.</i>

756
00:35:22,665 --> 00:35:25,002
<i>Some said it was the
hand of destiny.</i>

757
00:35:25,335 --> 00:35:27,413
<i>Others felt it
was heatstroke.</i>

758
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,831
<i>Eventually, Phan Bing
was forced to steal</i>

759
00:35:31,085 --> 00:35:33,080
<i>the clothes off a
former soldier.</i>

760
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,763
<i>Returning to
his journey,</i>

761
00:35:37,097 --> 00:35:39,142
<i>he soon realized
he was not alone.</i>

762
00:35:41,355 --> 00:35:43,473
<i>Phan Bing
immediately realized</i>

763
00:35:43,818 --> 00:35:46,411
<i>he did not belong in this
place at this time.</i>

764
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:50,560
<i>But this time and place seemed
more than happy to have him.</i>

765
00:35:51,405 --> 00:35:55,112
<i>Decorated for his bravery in
the Battle of Missionary Ridge</i>

766
00:35:55,405 --> 00:35:57,652
<i>and the second Battle
of Murfreesboro,</i>

767
00:35:57,695 --> 00:36:00,531
<i>Phan Bing went on to
found his own branch of</i>

768
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:03,373
<i>the Woodruff
family tree.</i>

769
00:36:19,936 --> 00:36:22,590
This sword was supposed to
be buried with my grandpa.

770
00:36:22,606 --> 00:36:24,531
Instead, it shows up in
some online auction,

771
00:36:24,565 --> 00:36:26,310
at which I take umbrage!

772
00:36:29,278 --> 00:36:32,483
Remember, mind over matter
makes pooh unfatter.

773
00:36:32,735 --> 00:36:33,940
I might be stuck,

774
00:36:34,008 --> 00:36:35,980
but I can still reach my gun.

775
00:36:40,325 --> 00:36:42,603
Now, you should know
that I was thrice named

776
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,630
alternate swordmaster
at the southern area

777
00:36:44,666 --> 00:36:47,340
regional volunteer infantry
re-enactment regiment.

778
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,250
I wanted to be a Jedi.

779
00:36:56,885 --> 00:37:00,172
You killed Louis Schatz and
stuffed him in my freezer.

780
00:37:00,478 --> 00:37:02,271
- I put food in there!
- It wasn't my fault,

781
00:37:02,305 --> 00:37:03,342
it just happened.

782
00:37:03,767 --> 00:37:06,162
- Not like you killed Lawrence Schatz.
- Did not!

783
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:12,233
I saw you.
You didn't see squat.

784
00:37:12,528 --> 00:37:14,673
<i>Wilfred Woodruff
saw more than squat</i>

785
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:16,620
<i>when he approached
Lawrence Schatz about</i>

786
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:19,462
<i>his great-great-great-great-
grandfather's sword.</i>

787
00:37:19,865 --> 00:37:22,240
<i>He saw the pie maker
fleeing the scene</i>

788
00:37:22,268 --> 00:37:24,202
<i>of Lawrence
Schatz's murder.</i>

789
00:37:27,498 --> 00:37:28,972
I didn't touch Lawrence Schatz,

790
00:37:29,005 --> 00:37:31,102
not till after he died,
and in his coffin.

791
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:32,561
I didn't touch Louis Schatz,

792
00:37:32,627 --> 00:37:34,123
not until after he died

793
00:37:34,138 --> 00:37:35,933
and I rolled him
onto a dolly truck.

794
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,600
- All because you wrote a nasty letter?
- I wrote a death threat.

795
00:37:41,636 --> 00:37:42,882
Then someone died.

796
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,280
That has a way of coming
back to haunt you.

797
00:37:48,607 --> 00:37:51,143
Unless you frame someone for murder,
you ass!

798
00:37:51,355 --> 00:37:52,483
I had no choice.

799
00:37:56,746 --> 00:37:58,023
Of course you did.

800
00:37:58,238 --> 00:37:59,680
Everything we do is a choice.

801
00:37:59,788 --> 00:38:01,463
Oatmeal or cereal,
highway or side streets,

802
00:38:01,495 --> 00:38:02,653
kiss her or keep her?

803
00:38:02,957 --> 00:38:05,131
We make choices,
and we live with the consequences.

804
00:38:05,165 --> 00:38:06,752
If someone gets
hurt along the way,

805
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:07,930
we ask for forgiveness.

806
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:10,602
- It's the best anyone can do.
- I can do better!

807
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:21,590
Ned?

808
00:38:39,867 --> 00:38:42,440
Help! Kick, pooh, kick!

809
00:38:44,498 --> 00:38:45,952
<i>At that very moment,</i>

810
00:38:46,248 --> 00:38:47,912
<i>Chuck saw the pie maker</i>

811
00:38:48,116 --> 00:38:50,163
<i>perhaps not as
he really was,</i>

812
00:38:50,225 --> 00:38:53,000
<i>but as he would always
appear to her--</i>

813
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,002
<i>her Prince Charming.</i>

814
00:39:10,305 --> 00:39:14,272
<i>Olive Snook's blood stirred with
revelation and opportunity.</i>

815
00:39:14,645 --> 00:39:16,982
<i>She could see Chuck
had faked her death</i>

816
00:39:17,005 --> 00:39:18,850
<i>for some
nefarious purpose.</i>

817
00:39:19,105 --> 00:39:21,603
I can smell trouble on her,
like she stepped in it

818
00:39:21,615 --> 00:39:23,071
and it's stuck to her heel.

819
00:39:23,106 --> 00:39:24,572
<i>What she couldn't see</i>

820
00:39:24,907 --> 00:39:27,802
<i>was the distant glimmer of
her own Prince Charming.</i>

821
00:39:28,036 --> 00:39:29,781
<i>The broken
espresso machine,</i>

822
00:39:29,957 --> 00:39:31,701
<i>sitting there,
being pretty,</i>

823
00:39:31,996 --> 00:39:34,440
<i>with no one to touch it,
had been touched,</i>

824
00:39:34,668 --> 00:39:37,791
<i>filled with water,
and packed with coffee grounds.</i>

825
00:39:40,798 --> 00:39:44,803
<i>For the time being, the romantic
gesture was lost on Olive.</i>

826
00:39:45,055 --> 00:39:47,131
<i>Her espresso was
much too bitter,</i>

827
00:39:47,515 --> 00:39:49,933
<i>but this would not
be her last cup.</i>

828
00:39:50,227 --> 00:39:52,683
<i>Not bitter at all
was Emerson Cod.</i>

829
00:39:52,936 --> 00:39:55,122
<i>He learned a lesson from
the brothers Schatz.</i>

830
00:39:55,155 --> 00:39:57,142
<i>It wasn't what
he had gained.</i>

831
00:39:57,198 --> 00:39:59,142
<i>It was what he
wanted to lose.</i>

832
00:39:59,195 --> 00:40:01,360
<i>He didn't want to lead
the life they led--</i>

833
00:40:01,395 --> 00:40:04,791
<i>Not to say he no longer wanted
to make a living off the dead.</i>

834
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:07,882
<i>He made a decision while
wedged in the window that day</i>

835
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,990
<i>never to be
wedged again.</i>

836
00:40:16,257 --> 00:40:17,870
<i>At that same moment,</i>

837
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:21,380
<i>Lily and Vivian Charles were
enjoying a wedge of happiness</i>

838
00:40:21,398 --> 00:40:23,960
<i>with gruyère baked
into the crust.</i>

839
00:40:27,095 --> 00:40:29,781
Woodruff was charged today for
his involvement in the death

840
00:40:29,818 --> 00:40:33,182
of Louis Schatz-- a key player
in the grave-robbing scandal.

841
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:36,163
<i>The gift of life Chuck had
been given was, indeed,</i>

842
00:40:36,198 --> 00:40:37,980
<i>the gift that
kept giving.</i>

843
00:40:38,317 --> 00:40:41,060
<i>She went about matching
hate mail with heirlooms</i>

844
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:43,602
<i>and regifting them to
their rightful heirs,</i>

845
00:40:43,778 --> 00:40:46,900
<i>like she had been regifted
to the pie maker.</i>

846
00:40:48,198 --> 00:40:49,652
I would do it again.

847
00:40:50,575 --> 00:40:52,451
Oh, I think it's
nice the way it is.

848
00:40:52,707 --> 00:40:53,872
No.

849
00:40:54,455 --> 00:40:55,621
I made a choice,

850
00:40:55,877 --> 00:40:57,200
and I would do it again.

851
00:40:57,547 --> 00:40:59,413
I let Lawrence Schatz die,

852
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:01,720
and if I was faced with
that choice right now,

853
00:41:01,756 --> 00:41:03,733
I would make the same choice.
You could put me in a loop,

854
00:41:03,768 --> 00:41:05,521
and I would make the
same choice every time.

855
00:41:05,557 --> 00:41:06,802
That's how confident I am

856
00:41:06,805 --> 00:41:08,771
that it was the right
choice for me to make.

857
00:41:08,805 --> 00:41:11,153
I'm sorry if that makes
me a bad person, but...

858
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:14,932
I'm not sorry that
you're alive.

859
00:41:15,937 --> 00:41:17,581
I like that you
made that choice,

860
00:41:17,855 --> 00:41:19,901
and the fact that you
did it on purpose--

861
00:41:20,066 --> 00:41:23,161
Well, it makes it far more fun
than if you did it by accident.

862
00:41:28,828 --> 00:41:31,702
I'm gonna see if I've
got some plastic wrap.

863
00:41:31,715 --> 00:41:35,913
