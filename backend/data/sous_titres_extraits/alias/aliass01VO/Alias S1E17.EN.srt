1
00:00:05,523 --> 00:00:09,944
DSR investigators want to know why
your picture's in the Rambaldi book.

2
00:00:10,027 --> 00:00:14,281
- They've decoded some of the text.
- And? What did it say?

3
00:00:14,365 --> 00:00:16,575
They're calling it "the prophecy".

4
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:18,202
Vaughn?

5
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:20,121
Pursuant to national security,

6
00:00:20,204 --> 00:00:23,082
you are in the custody
of the Federal Government.

7
00:00:23,165 --> 00:00:27,378
- They broke the Rambaldi code.
- What does the prophecy say?

8
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:31,298
"This woman here depicted
will possess unseen marks."

9
00:00:31,382 --> 00:00:34,593
"Signs that she will be the one
to bring forth my works."

10
00:00:34,677 --> 00:00:37,555
"Bind them with fury,
a burning anger."

11
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:40,391
"Unless prevented, at vulgar cost,

12
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:43,811
this woman will render
the greatest power

13
00:00:43,894 --> 00:00:47,064
unto utter desolation."

14
00:02:36,173 --> 00:02:38,384
It's vanilla.

15
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:41,637
- Milk shake.
- Will you do me a favour?

16
00:02:43,013 --> 00:02:47,852
Will you remind them that
I cooperated? That I didn't resist?

17
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,106
I don't need these restraints.

18
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:54,400
I'll tell them.

19
00:03:07,496 --> 00:03:10,791
- What did the DSR tell the FBI?
- The DSR didn't say.

20
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,835
But you're inter-agency liaison.

21
00:03:12,918 --> 00:03:17,089
Inter-agency liaison doesn't put me
smack-dab in the inner circle.

22
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:22,636
Look, you and I don't work well
together, historically.

23
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,767
We've got this
juvenile animosity thing going,

24
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,645
and that's got to change.
Let's just start over.

25
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:35,816
Hi. How are you? I don't know what
they're planning to do to Bristow.

26
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,486
If I were you, I'd let it go.

27
00:03:42,531 --> 00:03:44,950
A buddy of mine at Princeton
knows Haladki.

28
00:03:45,034 --> 00:03:48,913
Says she used to see him
eating lunch at the Webster Rotunda.

29
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:52,750
That guy's got the table manners
of a six-month-old.

30
00:03:54,627 --> 00:03:56,295
I'm gonna ask you a question.

31
00:03:56,378 --> 00:03:59,131
- I need you to be honest.
- Sure.

32
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:05,095
Do you believe in this thing,
this prophecy?

33
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:10,351
- You do, don't you?
- No, it's ridiculous.

34
00:04:10,434 --> 00:04:12,728
But that picture looks just like her!

35
00:04:12,812 --> 00:04:14,814
Sydney's gonna take down the world?

36
00:04:14,897 --> 00:04:17,316
But the DNA sequence,
the heart size,

37
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,401
they match what Rambaldi wrote.

38
00:04:20,152 --> 00:04:26,659
I mean, either this thing
is completely insane... or it isn't.

39
00:04:26,742 --> 00:04:28,953
OK, what happened?
The FBI's involved?

40
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:33,124
Yeah. There's an FBI tribunal
flying in from DC.

41
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:37,378
They're gonna question her
and decide what the next move is.

42
00:04:41,257 --> 00:04:46,303
Ms Bristow, I'm Special Officer
Kendall, FBI. Ms Baker. Mr Dunn.

43
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:50,266
You're being held under
National Security Directive 81 A.

44
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:53,561
We can legally file
formal charges against you

45
00:04:53,644 --> 00:04:55,312
based on current evidence.

46
00:04:55,396 --> 00:04:59,024
We'd appreciate your cooperation
in answering some questions.

47
00:04:59,108 --> 00:05:03,487
If you choose legal counsel,
we'll charge you on current evidence.

48
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:08,033
- It's your decision.
- I have nothing to hide.

49
00:05:11,203 --> 00:05:13,038
Your name and occupation?

50
00:05:13,122 --> 00:05:17,001
Sydney Bristow. Intelligence
officer for the US Government.

51
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:19,378
- Under which agency?
- CIA.

52
00:05:19,462 --> 00:05:22,465
How did you come to work
with the CIA?

53
00:05:22,548 --> 00:05:25,843
- Don't you have a file on me?
- We'd like this in your words.

54
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,767
I came to work with the CIA
through my involvement with SD-6.

55
00:05:33,184 --> 00:05:35,186
How did you get involved with SD-6?

56
00:05:37,396 --> 00:05:40,107
I was a student.
A freshman at college.

57
00:05:41,734 --> 00:05:44,570
A man said
he worked with US Intelligence

58
00:05:44,653 --> 00:05:47,031
and they wanted to interview me.

59
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:50,242
- And you agreed?
- No! Not at first.

60
00:05:50,326 --> 00:05:53,037
It was the last thing
I was interested in,

61
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,456
working for the US Government.

62
00:05:55,539 --> 00:06:00,711
But I found myself wondering
if I could actually become a spy.

63
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:04,548
- And you believed that you could?
- Sort of, which is crazy.

64
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:09,261
I didn't even realise
what being a spy meant.

65
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:13,933
The truth is, I didn't love
any of the subjects I was studying.

66
00:06:14,016 --> 00:06:17,645
My father and I weren't speaking,
my mother died when I was six,

67
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:21,273
and the highlight of my social life
was my dorm's salad bar.

68
00:06:22,233 --> 00:06:24,110
So I called them.

69
00:06:24,193 --> 00:06:27,238
- SD-6?
- They didn't use that name.

70
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:29,532
They led me to believe
they were CIA.

71
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:32,368
They were... are very convincing.

72
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:36,413
So, you met with an organisation
that you believed was the CIA?

73
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:37,331
Yes.

74
00:06:37,414 --> 00:06:41,001
They had me sign
about 500 non-disclosure agreements

75
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:42,378
and offered me a job.

76
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:44,046
Just like that?

77
00:06:45,214 --> 00:06:47,758
They had me take a job
as an office assistant

78
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:50,553
in a corporate bank downtown.

79
00:06:50,636 --> 00:06:54,765
I just assumed that the bank
was somehow affiliated with the CIA.

80
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:59,103
They said they would be watching
me. This was the evaluation phase.

81
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:00,938
That lasted for six months.

82
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:05,901
And then they told me
I was ready for the transition.

83
00:07:05,985 --> 00:07:09,864
- Transition?
- Eight months of training, tests...

84
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,116
...propaganda.

85
00:07:13,242 --> 00:07:17,538
Before that, I had never fired
a gun. I'd never thrown a punch.

86
00:07:18,581 --> 00:07:21,917
During the transition
I first heard the term SD-6.

87
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:26,088
And you believed that SD-6
was affiliated with the CIA?

88
00:07:26,172 --> 00:07:28,966
Yes, that it was
a black-ops division of the CIA.

89
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,634
Meaning?

90
00:07:32,011 --> 00:07:33,721
You mean, what is black-ops?

91
00:07:37,975 --> 00:07:41,187
A division that is funded
by the CIA's black budget.

92
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:45,524
Highly classified operations,
hidden from congressional oversight.

93
00:07:45,608 --> 00:07:48,068
I believed
SD-6 was one of these divisions

94
00:07:48,152 --> 00:07:50,529
that didn't operate through Langley.

95
00:07:50,613 --> 00:07:52,364
You never questioned that?

96
00:07:53,491 --> 00:07:57,953
As I said before, Mr Kendall,
they were very convincing.

97
00:07:58,996 --> 00:08:02,041
Now, I might not have been a genius
at 19 years old,

98
00:08:02,124 --> 00:08:05,127
but I was smart enough
to know what questions to ask.

99
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:09,256
- They had all the right answers.
- It says here you were a genius.

100
00:08:14,136 --> 00:08:16,222
And how did the transition end?

101
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:20,476
They made reference
to the SD-6 headquarters.

102
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:23,896
They told me they'd take me there.

103
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:30,152
I didn't realise that getting there
only required a ride in the elevator.

104
00:08:30,986 --> 00:08:32,988
The office of SD-6 is located

105
00:08:33,072 --> 00:08:36,200
on sub-level six
of the Credit Dauphine building.

106
00:09:01,016 --> 00:09:03,853
The first time
I walked through there,

107
00:09:03,936 --> 00:09:05,479
surrounded by strangers

108
00:09:05,563 --> 00:09:09,567
who I thought were working
for the good of the country,

109
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,236
I felt wildly patriotic.

110
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,282
And then I met Arvin Sloane.

111
00:09:16,365 --> 00:09:18,451
So, you're Sydney Bristow?

112
00:09:19,577 --> 00:09:21,787
- Yes, sir.
- Nice to meet you.

113
00:09:21,871 --> 00:09:25,416
I'm Arvin Sloane. Welcome to SD-6.

114
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:37,428
What if I need to go to the bathroom?

115
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:39,430
I think we can arrange that.

116
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:00,534
Anything?

117
00:10:00,618 --> 00:10:04,330
My FBI contacts don't have access
to Sydney's case. It's classified.

118
00:10:04,413 --> 00:10:06,749
- What about Devlin?
- He has no clearance.

119
00:10:06,832 --> 00:10:11,003
All we know is Sydney's being held
locally. We gotta find out where.

120
00:10:11,086 --> 00:10:14,673
Where is irrelevant. How long
she's in custody concerns me.

121
00:10:14,757 --> 00:10:17,510
Sloane wants to meet her on Tuesday.

122
00:10:17,593 --> 00:10:21,764
Maybe the FBI won't put as much
credence in the prophecy as DSR.

123
00:10:21,847 --> 00:10:25,810
Wrong. In the current climate,
the FBI's being wildly vigilant.

124
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:29,730
If another government agency
red-flags someone as a threat,

125
00:10:29,814 --> 00:10:32,024
the FBI won't be so quick
to let them go.

126
00:10:32,108 --> 00:10:35,111
You're saying Sydney's cover
could be blown to SD-6?

127
00:10:36,153 --> 00:10:40,241
Under Directive 81 A they could
conceivably hold her without trial,

128
00:10:40,324 --> 00:10:42,701
or charges, for the rest of her life.

129
00:11:13,566 --> 00:11:16,360
Describe your role within SD-6.

130
00:11:17,236 --> 00:11:20,281
Desk work at first,
but I advanced quickly.

131
00:11:20,364 --> 00:11:23,868
Within a year I was out
on reconnaissance missions.

132
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:26,829
Always believing
that you were working for the CIA?

133
00:11:28,372 --> 00:11:32,460
Mr Kendall, with the exception
of a half-dozen high-level officers,

134
00:11:32,543 --> 00:11:35,504
the entire office
believes they work for the CIA.

135
00:11:36,422 --> 00:11:41,719
You remained in school during all
of this. Why? Did SD-6 want you to?

136
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:45,681
No, they didn't want me to.
It was something I wanted to do.

137
00:11:45,765 --> 00:11:49,185
Become a teacher.
I didn't want to give that up.

138
00:11:49,894 --> 00:11:51,437
Who was Daniel Hecht?

139
00:11:56,776 --> 00:11:58,694
Danny was my fiancé.

140
00:12:00,613 --> 00:12:03,449
Could you tell us
what happened to him, please?

141
00:12:06,744 --> 00:12:08,370
"You build me up"

142
00:12:08,454 --> 00:12:09,830
"Buttercup baby"

143
00:12:09,914 --> 00:12:11,707
"Then you bring me down"

144
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:14,919
And mess me around
And then worst of all

145
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:18,672
You never call, baby,
When you say you will...

146
00:12:18,756 --> 00:12:22,802
We had been together two years
when Danny proposed.

147
00:12:22,885 --> 00:12:25,012
Don't break my heart

148
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:30,184
I had never told anyone
about my involvement with SD-6.

149
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,941
But I knew
that if I was gonna marry Danny,

150
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:39,610
he had to know the truth.

151
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:46,075
So I told him that I was a spy.

152
00:12:48,244 --> 00:12:51,330
While I was in Taipei
on an operation...

153
00:12:52,373 --> 00:12:54,959
... SD-6 had him killed.

154
00:13:05,636 --> 00:13:08,973
So SD-6 murdered your fiancé?

155
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:13,811
- Yes, they did.
- That didn't seem extreme to you?

156
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:16,313
I don't understand your question.

157
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:19,442
How could a girl
as brilliant as yourself believe

158
00:13:19,525 --> 00:13:22,570
that an agency that assassinated
an innocent civilian

159
00:13:22,653 --> 00:13:25,030
could be affiliated
with the US Government?

160
00:13:26,407 --> 00:13:29,285
You're saying
I knew about SD-6 all along?

161
00:13:29,368 --> 00:13:32,079
You claim to have learned the truth
about SD-6 when?

162
00:13:32,163 --> 00:13:34,498
It wasn't a claim, it was the truth!

163
00:13:42,006 --> 00:13:44,133
After Danny...

164
00:13:45,676 --> 00:13:48,179
...I refused to return to SD-6,

165
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:52,349
which they saw as a betrayal.
That's when they came after me.

166
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:59,356
It was that night that I learned
that my father,

167
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:06,864
who I was never very close to,
was also an officer with SD-6.

168
00:14:28,803 --> 00:14:29,845
Get in!

169
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:33,432
Daddy?

170
00:14:33,516 --> 00:14:36,602
And I learned
who I was really working for.

171
00:14:36,685 --> 00:14:39,146
A decade ago,
some agents went freelance.

172
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,314
The Alliance of 12.

173
00:14:40,397 --> 00:14:43,567
- What do you know about them?
- They're mercenaries.

174
00:14:43,651 --> 00:14:48,114
I'm one of them. SD-6 is not
a black-ops division of the CIA.

175
00:14:48,197 --> 00:14:51,367
SD-6 is a branch of the Alliance.

176
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:54,245
You work for the enemy
you thought you were fighting.

177
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:55,913
That's impossible.

178
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:59,333
That was the first time
I heard the truth about SD-6.

179
00:15:01,627 --> 00:15:03,754
The first time.

180
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,174
Make sure
Susan gets Donaldson's briefing.

181
00:15:07,258 --> 00:15:10,094
Call Josh. Tell him
I have to cancel lunch. I've...

182
00:15:14,765 --> 00:15:17,017
What did you say about Haladki?

183
00:15:17,101 --> 00:15:19,478
- He doesn't shower?
- About your friend.

184
00:15:19,562 --> 00:15:22,773
- She used to see him at lunch.
- At the Webster Rotunda?

185
00:15:22,857 --> 00:15:25,526
- At the Adams Federal building?
- Yeah. Why?

186
00:15:25,609 --> 00:15:29,613
You're not allowed in the Rotunda
unless you're a ranking FBI officer.

187
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,159
No way.

188
00:15:35,327 --> 00:15:37,955
- You know what? Excuse me!
- You were FBI.

189
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:40,082
Before you were CIA, you were FBI.

190
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:43,711
My FBI history is on my resumé.
I'll give you a copy.

191
00:15:43,794 --> 00:15:45,713
You know what FBI protocol is,

192
00:15:45,796 --> 00:15:48,591
where Sydney is,
and what they plan to do with her.

193
00:15:48,674 --> 00:15:50,050
You have lost your mind.

194
00:15:50,134 --> 00:15:52,595
- You're the one on the witch-hunt!
- Look!

195
00:15:52,678 --> 00:15:57,308
We've decoded
47 verifiable Rambaldi predictions.

196
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:59,268
He hasn't been wrong once.

197
00:15:59,351 --> 00:16:02,396
- Where is she?
- What if he's not wrong about this?

198
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,149
What if Sydney Bristow is a threat?

199
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:07,401
What if Rambaldi got it right?

200
00:16:09,361 --> 00:16:13,032
What did they tell you
was the objective of SD-6?

201
00:16:13,115 --> 00:16:15,618
The retrieval
and study of intelligence,

202
00:16:15,701 --> 00:16:18,621
both military and industrial,
throughout the world,

203
00:16:18,704 --> 00:16:23,167
that is critical to the superiority
and survival of the USA.

204
00:16:23,793 --> 00:16:25,211
That's the company line.

205
00:16:25,294 --> 00:16:27,087
Well, what does SD stand for?

206
00:16:27,171 --> 00:16:30,925
Section Disparue.
The section that doesn't exist.

207
00:16:31,008 --> 00:16:34,512
Alain Christophe of the Alliance,
the term was his.

208
00:16:34,595 --> 00:16:38,933
- Explain about the Alliance of 12.
- It's like a board of directors.

209
00:16:39,016 --> 00:16:42,895
Some are from the private sector,
but most were intelligence officers.

210
00:16:42,978 --> 00:16:44,647
All wealthy.

211
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:48,567
They started a company, except
this company trades intelligence.

212
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:51,695
- So they're after...
- Weapons, military secrets,

213
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:55,324
industrial intel,
computer advances, political agendas.

214
00:16:55,407 --> 00:16:57,910
- Anything the other guy wants.
- The other guy?

215
00:16:57,993 --> 00:17:01,872
Governments, corporations,
wealthy citizens, families.

216
00:17:01,956 --> 00:17:04,542
It's all black market.
It's organised crime.

217
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,377
Could you give me an example?

218
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,505
Do you remember
the Carbon-Proxy disaster in '92?

219
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:12,216
An accidental methylisocyanate leak

220
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,010
at a manufacturing plant
in Bangalore, India.

221
00:17:15,094 --> 00:17:17,596
Killed 3,000. Another 1,000 disabled.

222
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,224
1996, near Kyoto, Japan,

223
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:23,602
a bullet train accidentally
switched tracks and derailed.

224
00:17:23,686 --> 00:17:25,229
150 people were killed.

225
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:27,022
Last year, in Germany,

226
00:17:27,106 --> 00:17:30,609
a transport plane suffered
mechanical failure outside Munich.

227
00:17:30,693 --> 00:17:32,236
12 lives were lost.

228
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:34,280
None of them were accidents.

229
00:17:34,363 --> 00:17:36,115
Some were acts of revenge,

230
00:17:36,198 --> 00:17:40,161
others were personal favours to those
who helped to fund the Alliance.

231
00:17:40,244 --> 00:17:44,039
Some were distractions, so that
local resources were occupied

232
00:17:44,123 --> 00:17:47,501
so that SD-4 or SD-7
could infiltrate a building somewhere

233
00:17:47,585 --> 00:17:49,545
and retrieve sensitive data.

234
00:17:51,046 --> 00:17:52,089
Go on.

235
00:17:53,716 --> 00:17:57,887
After what they did to Danny,
what they tried to do to me...

236
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:01,432
...I swore I'd destroy them.

237
00:18:02,475 --> 00:18:04,477
SD-6.

238
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,229
But first I had to win back
their confidence,

239
00:18:07,313 --> 00:18:10,941
so I stole something
that I knew Arvin Sloane wanted.

240
00:18:11,025 --> 00:18:15,613
A device based on the design
by Milo Rambaldi.

241
00:18:17,156 --> 00:18:18,699
I'm back.

242
00:18:18,783 --> 00:18:22,286
Then I went to the people
I thought I'd been working for.

243
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:26,207
That's where I met my handler,
Michael Vaughn.

244
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:30,544
I thought the job would be over
by Christmas.

245
00:18:31,796 --> 00:18:34,924
It was Vaughn
who made it clear to me...

246
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,177
... what I was really up against.

247
00:18:40,096 --> 00:18:42,181
That's how I became
a double agent.

248
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:47,144
And a few days later,
your father came to see you,

249
00:18:47,228 --> 00:18:50,856
and revealed that he was
a double agent working for the CIA.

250
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,150
That his job at SD-6 was cover, too.

251
00:18:53,234 --> 00:18:54,527
Yes, that's right.

252
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,029
Father and daughter, double agents.

253
00:18:59,323 --> 00:19:01,617
- Yes.
- This is what doesn't make sense.

254
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,662
Why recruit his daughter
into that environment?

255
00:19:04,745 --> 00:19:06,622
He wouldn't. He didn't.

256
00:19:06,705 --> 00:19:12,044
Sloane knew my parents years before
they were married. He brought me in.

257
00:19:12,128 --> 00:19:14,588
He didn't tell my father
until I was active.

258
00:19:14,672 --> 00:19:16,549
Why did Sloane go after you?

259
00:19:16,632 --> 00:19:18,759
I don't know.

260
00:19:18,843 --> 00:19:22,138
You're sure Sloane brought you
into SD-6, not your father?

261
00:19:23,389 --> 00:19:25,516
- Why do you ask?
- As far as you've seen,

262
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:28,644
your father's allegiance
has always been with the CIA?

263
00:19:29,728 --> 00:19:32,273
I have been very patient with you

264
00:19:32,356 --> 00:19:34,900
and your implications
that I can't be trusted.

265
00:19:34,984 --> 00:19:37,820
- Ms Bristow...
- But you won't insult my father.

266
00:19:37,903 --> 00:19:39,280
That is unacceptable.

267
00:19:39,363 --> 00:19:41,949
- It was just a question.
- It was an accusation.

268
00:19:42,032 --> 00:19:45,244
And you're questioning my honour,
my loyalty,

269
00:19:45,327 --> 00:19:49,540
based on a prophecy in a book you
wouldn't have if it weren't for me!

270
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:53,419
- We'll take a break.
- I want to finish this and go home!

271
00:19:53,502 --> 00:19:55,087
Sit down! Listen to me!

272
00:19:55,171 --> 00:19:59,133
I want to go home! I want to...
Just wait a minute!

273
00:20:07,725 --> 00:20:10,770
OK, here we go.
Look at this. Rocking the cradle.

274
00:20:10,853 --> 00:20:13,355
"Unless prevented at vulgar cost,

275
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:16,859
she will render the greatest power
unto utter desolation."

276
00:20:16,942 --> 00:20:19,153
You're making yourself crazy.

277
00:20:19,236 --> 00:20:22,072
- What's "vulgar cost"?
- I don't know.

278
00:20:22,156 --> 00:20:24,617
"This woman will have had her effect,

279
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,912
never having seen the beauty
of my sky behind Mount Subasio."

280
00:20:27,995 --> 00:20:30,456
"A glance may have quelled her fire."

281
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:33,876
- Yo-yo's sleeping.
- Mount Subasio?

282
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:36,462
I think
that's where Rambaldi was born.

283
00:20:36,545 --> 00:20:39,215
Why don't we all go to Mount Subasio?

284
00:20:39,298 --> 00:20:41,884
Here we go, around the world.

285
00:20:45,096 --> 00:20:46,430
What? What happened?

286
00:20:51,727 --> 00:20:55,606
Thanks for coming. SD-6 security
have nothing on Sydney.

287
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:57,191
Look at this.

288
00:20:57,274 --> 00:21:01,862
"This woman will have had her effect,
never having seen Mount Subasio."

289
00:21:01,946 --> 00:21:04,532
If the FBI takes this so literally,

290
00:21:04,615 --> 00:21:07,076
every phrase
must have equal veracity.

291
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:12,706
According to Rambaldi, the woman
will have never seen Mount Subasio.

292
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,459
So if Sydney went there and saw it...

293
00:21:15,543 --> 00:21:19,505
- She couldn't be the woman.
- Makes sense, doesn't it?

294
00:21:19,588 --> 00:21:20,631
It's good.

295
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:24,927
Devlin put three calls in to the
FBI about this and was stonewalled.

296
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,680
They're not in a cooperative mood.

297
00:21:29,181 --> 00:21:33,144
We'll have to extract her.
Get her to Italy ourselves.

298
00:21:34,895 --> 00:21:38,357
Devlin would sanction transit.
A jet could be ready in an hour.

299
00:21:38,441 --> 00:21:40,025
How do we find her?

300
00:21:40,109 --> 00:21:43,946
Steven Haladki. He's CIA,
former FBI. I know he still has ties.

301
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:47,867
- Haladki? I'll talk to him.
- The problem is he's not talking.

302
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:50,453
He'll talk to me.

303
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:59,712
When we left off,
we were chatting about your father.

304
00:21:59,795 --> 00:22:02,715
What can you tell me
about your mother?

305
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:11,474
For most of my life, I thought she
was a literature professor at UCLA.

306
00:22:13,267 --> 00:22:18,355
I thought that she was a loving
mother and an adoring wife.

307
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,526
Apparently
I couldn't have been more wrong.

308
00:22:23,611 --> 00:22:25,112
Could you elaborate?

309
00:22:26,781 --> 00:22:29,742
A few months ago,
I noticed something unusual.

310
00:22:30,868 --> 00:22:35,706
I found Cyrillic codes in old books
that my father had purchased.

311
00:22:36,749 --> 00:22:40,252
I began to suspect him of
having collaborated with the KGB.

312
00:22:41,754 --> 00:22:44,006
But that wasn't the case, was it?

313
00:22:46,133 --> 00:22:47,176
No.

314
00:22:47,259 --> 00:22:49,762
Those Cyrillic codes in those books,

315
00:22:50,513 --> 00:22:53,140
yes, they were orders from the KGB,

316
00:22:53,224 --> 00:22:56,852
and yes, they were orders to kill.

317
00:22:57,812 --> 00:23:00,898
An agent received those orders
and carried them out.

318
00:23:00,981 --> 00:23:04,068
But, Sydney, I was not that agent.

319
00:23:06,612 --> 00:23:08,030
Your mother was.

320
00:23:17,748 --> 00:23:19,458
Your mother was a traitor?

321
00:23:20,835 --> 00:23:22,044
Yes.

322
00:23:22,128 --> 00:23:25,923
A woman who appeared to be
one thing, but actually was another.

323
00:23:29,552 --> 00:23:31,095
Your mother.

324
00:23:36,642 --> 00:23:38,477
Tell me how she died.

325
00:23:42,231 --> 00:23:44,733
I...

326
00:23:45,776 --> 00:23:49,655
I used to think my mother
and father were driving together.

327
00:23:49,738 --> 00:23:52,700
I was wrong.
My mother was actually alone.

328
00:23:53,742 --> 00:23:58,873
She was being pursued by
an FBI counterintelligence officer.

329
00:23:58,956 --> 00:24:01,959
The roads were slippery.
There was an accident.

330
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:05,296
The cars went into the river.

331
00:24:08,132 --> 00:24:11,135
After she died, your father
raised you. Is that right?

332
00:24:12,553 --> 00:24:15,389
No. He hired a nanny.

333
00:24:15,473 --> 00:24:20,895
As I said, he and I didn't have much
of a relationship until recently.

334
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:28,277
So, like your father, you're a
double agent. Tell us how that works.

335
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,113
It always begins
with something SD-6 wants.

336
00:24:31,197 --> 00:24:34,825
Information. Technology.
Classified data.

337
00:24:35,868 --> 00:24:40,080
Sloane outlines the mission,
then Marshall reviews the tech.

338
00:24:40,164 --> 00:24:43,000
- Marshall?
- He's our tech guy.

339
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:46,003
This looks like
a normal phone you'd call...

340
00:24:46,086 --> 00:24:49,840
"I'm gonna be late for dinner, Dad.
Don't wait up for me."

341
00:24:49,924 --> 00:24:52,384
Biometric sensor. What it does...

342
00:24:52,468 --> 00:24:55,012
Barely touch it
and you are knocked out cold.

343
00:24:55,096 --> 00:24:58,516
You just, like, freebasing Thorazine.
You're out.

344
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:00,935
This looks like a normal purse,
right?

345
00:25:01,018 --> 00:25:05,022
You would wear it at the beach
or wherever... putting in...

346
00:25:05,106 --> 00:25:08,859
But it is a parabolic microphone.

347
00:25:08,943 --> 00:25:14,198
They take pictures and have telephoto
lenses, and they're super-swank.

348
00:25:14,281 --> 00:25:17,076
Once I have the mission laid out,
I contact the CIA.

349
00:25:18,035 --> 00:25:21,247
I detail the SD-6 operation
on a brown paper bag

350
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,542
and wait for the CIA to contact me.

351
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:28,003
After the CIA reviews the mission,
what then?

352
00:25:28,087 --> 00:25:30,714
I meet with Vaughn
to get my countermission.

353
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:33,300
Could you give us an example?

354
00:25:33,384 --> 00:25:36,345
SD-6 sends me to Moscow
to get computer disks.

355
00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:37,930
The CIA wants copies...

356
00:25:39,974 --> 00:25:43,227
I'm in the bar. I can see you.

357
00:25:44,228 --> 00:25:47,231
Are those the files?
If they are, cough.

358
00:25:48,441 --> 00:25:50,526
Get ready to make a switch.

359
00:26:10,171 --> 00:26:14,216
After I get back to Los Angeles,
I have to complete a brushpass

360
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,804
and give the stolen disks to
Vaughn so the CIA can make copies.

361
00:26:18,888 --> 00:26:22,516
Before I leave the airport, Vaughn
has to pass the originals back

362
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,643
so I can deliver them to Sloane.

363
00:26:26,771 --> 00:26:30,983
- Without my SD-6 partner knowing.
- Your SD-6 partner?

364
00:26:31,066 --> 00:26:32,109
Dixon.

365
00:26:32,193 --> 00:26:35,863
Dixon believes that SD-6
is affiliated with the CIA?

366
00:26:35,946 --> 00:26:38,991
- He doesn't know you're a double?
- That's right.

367
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:44,038
Does that ever cause problems?

368
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:53,088
SD-6 sent us to retrieve a vaccine
from a plant in Badenweiler,

369
00:26:53,172 --> 00:26:55,216
and destroy the empty building.

370
00:26:58,969 --> 00:27:01,055
While I was in a laboratory,

371
00:27:01,555 --> 00:27:04,642
Dixon was setting
the explosive charge.

372
00:27:04,725 --> 00:27:06,977
What I couldn't tell Dixon

373
00:27:07,061 --> 00:27:10,439
was that the CIA
also had a team in that building.

374
00:27:11,816 --> 00:27:15,194
- I've got a bomb to disengage.
- Please. We'd appreciate it.

375
00:27:20,324 --> 00:27:24,745
My CIA countermission
included disarming Dixon's bomb.

376
00:27:28,874 --> 00:27:32,044
- Did you get the inhalers?
- We're good.

377
00:27:32,128 --> 00:27:36,549
I knew Dixon's detonator
wouldn't work. That was the plan.

378
00:27:36,632 --> 00:27:38,843
Come on. We gotta go.

379
00:27:38,926 --> 00:27:43,639
I brought a secondary detonator
in case there was a frequency jam.

380
00:27:55,651 --> 00:27:56,735
Let's go.

381
00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:13,419
Can we take a break, please?
Just for a minute?

382
00:28:25,723 --> 00:28:28,601
I have no desire
to blow your head off,

383
00:28:28,684 --> 00:28:31,687
but I will, unless you tell me
where Sydney Bristow is.

384
00:28:31,771 --> 00:28:34,023
The Federal building on Moorepark.

385
00:28:34,106 --> 00:28:36,358
They won't keep her there.
What's the plan?

386
00:28:36,442 --> 00:28:37,860
There's a safe house.

387
00:28:37,943 --> 00:28:40,988
- When are they transferring her?
- What time? 5:30.

388
00:28:41,071 --> 00:28:42,907
- 5:30?
- I swear.

389
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,158
Just so we're clear,

390
00:28:44,241 --> 00:28:48,370
you report this conversation
and you'll never wear a hat again.

391
00:28:49,955 --> 00:28:52,750
I got it. No worries, I got it.

392
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:05,262
We need a list of people who are
aware of your double-agent status.

393
00:29:05,346 --> 00:29:07,139
It's a short list.

394
00:29:07,223 --> 00:29:09,725
Besides the CIA,
only my father knows.

395
00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:12,895
- You've never told anyone else?
- No.

396
00:29:12,978 --> 00:29:17,108
After what happened to Danny,
I thought I'd keep my mouth shut.

397
00:29:17,191 --> 00:29:21,028
I'm gonna call the bank. I'm gonna
quit for you. It's ridiculous.

398
00:29:21,112 --> 00:29:24,698
My job may seem pointless,
but it's not. Far from it.

399
00:29:24,782 --> 00:29:26,951
If you knew
what I dealt with every day,

400
00:29:27,034 --> 00:29:29,578
you might thank me
for doing my job so well.

401
00:29:31,831 --> 00:29:33,499
What are you talking about?

402
00:29:38,129 --> 00:29:41,465
Nothing. I'm going to work.

403
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:44,218
You have a hard time
keeping secrets?

404
00:29:44,301 --> 00:29:47,346
No, I don't have a hard time
keeping a secret.

405
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:50,266
What I don't enjoy
is lying to my friends,

406
00:29:50,349 --> 00:29:53,227
or being in a constant state
of jet lag

407
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:57,565
from flying to far corners of
the world for a man I wish were dead.

408
00:29:57,648 --> 00:29:58,816
Sloane?

409
00:29:58,899 --> 00:30:01,861
Yes. Sloane.

410
00:30:02,903 --> 00:30:05,573
How often does SD-6
send you on operations?

411
00:31:18,979 --> 00:31:20,314
I keep busy.

412
00:31:23,859 --> 00:31:26,695
What does SD-6 want?

413
00:31:28,072 --> 00:31:29,949
What is their priority?

414
00:31:30,658 --> 00:31:34,620
- At the moment, it's Rambaldi.
- What can you tell me about him?

415
00:31:36,497 --> 00:31:41,418
Milo Rambaldi was
Pope Alexander VI's chief architect.

416
00:31:41,502 --> 00:31:44,088
He was an artist, an inventor.

417
00:31:44,922 --> 00:31:47,800
His designs
were so technologically advanced

418
00:31:47,883 --> 00:31:51,762
that at the time they thought he was
a heretic, and he was executed.

419
00:31:51,846 --> 00:31:54,598
Now, 500 years later,

420
00:31:54,682 --> 00:31:57,226
many believe he was a prophet.

421
00:31:57,309 --> 00:32:00,438
And SD-6, CIA, GRU, K-Directorate,

422
00:32:01,021 --> 00:32:04,650
the entire intelligence world
is on a Rambaldi scavenger hunt.

423
00:32:04,733 --> 00:32:05,651
Why?

424
00:32:05,734 --> 00:32:09,447
They assume Rambaldi
had some sort of master plan,

425
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:13,701
which was recently confirmed
following my trip to Argentina.

426
00:32:56,202 --> 00:33:00,164
In that book, Rambaldi
refers to a single construction.

427
00:33:01,874 --> 00:33:04,001
The agencies
don't know what it is yet,

428
00:33:04,084 --> 00:33:07,922
but they're all afraid
the other guy's gonna get it first.

429
00:33:10,299 --> 00:33:12,176
I just have one more question.

430
00:33:17,681 --> 00:33:20,101
Do you believe
Rambaldi was a prophet?

431
00:33:23,187 --> 00:33:24,355
Do you?

432
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:32,488
You're not gonna let me go, are you?

433
00:33:37,451 --> 00:33:39,537
We're done for today.

434
00:33:56,595 --> 00:33:59,223
Get down! On the ground! Get down!

435
00:33:59,306 --> 00:34:01,600
- Don't move!
- You! Come with us!

436
00:34:04,061 --> 00:34:05,855
Go!

437
00:34:10,818 --> 00:34:13,404
We've got a silver van.
California plates.

438
00:34:17,992 --> 00:34:21,036
- You're gonna be OK.
- What are you doing?

439
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,872
Proving this is not about you.

440
00:34:22,955 --> 00:34:25,916
We'll explain when we get there.

441
00:34:27,001 --> 00:34:29,795
- Dad?
- Honey.

442
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,894
If the FBI are serious
about the prophecy,

443
00:34:44,977 --> 00:34:47,313
it's the key to your innocence.

444
00:34:47,396 --> 00:34:49,899
The woman in it
never saw Mount Subasio.

445
00:34:49,982 --> 00:34:51,150
So you're going.

446
00:34:51,233 --> 00:34:53,486
The FBI would have held you
for months.

447
00:34:53,569 --> 00:34:57,406
SD-6 would have investigated,
and you'd have been exposed.

448
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:59,825
Going to Mount Subasio
should prove...

449
00:34:59,909 --> 00:35:01,410
The FBI might have let me go.

450
00:35:01,494 --> 00:35:04,205
This makes them certain
that I'm guilty!

451
00:35:04,288 --> 00:35:06,832
Escaping and crossing the border

452
00:35:06,916 --> 00:35:09,835
proves I acted
in opposition to the US Government.

453
00:35:09,919 --> 00:35:13,339
It was either do nothing
or take a risk to protect your cover.

454
00:35:13,422 --> 00:35:15,007
I'm a fugitive from justice!

455
00:35:15,091 --> 00:35:19,678
Once you're in Italy, we'll alert
all agencies of your location.

456
00:35:19,762 --> 00:35:23,140
- You won't be a suspect.
- You don't know that.

457
00:35:23,224 --> 00:35:27,353
We'll have protected a CIA asset.
Your cover will be maintained.

458
00:35:27,436 --> 00:35:30,481
- The FBI won't make any noise.
- We gotta go.

459
00:35:30,564 --> 00:35:33,776
I'll take you to the jet.
Get in the trunk.

460
00:35:33,859 --> 00:35:37,321
What if the FBI was right?
What if Rambaldi was right?

461
00:35:37,404 --> 00:35:39,281
What if he was talking about me?

462
00:35:39,365 --> 00:35:42,910
Then nothing we do
makes any difference.

463
00:35:42,993 --> 00:35:45,538
If Rambaldi's right,
there's nothing to lose.

464
00:35:45,621 --> 00:35:47,540
The cops are everywhere.

465
00:35:47,623 --> 00:35:50,584
- Contact me from Italy.
- This is so we can speak.

466
00:35:55,965 --> 00:35:57,049
Alan? It's Steven.

467
00:35:57,133 --> 00:36:01,095
Listen, I need to tell you something
that happened today.

468
00:36:01,178 --> 00:36:06,725
No, I'm not OK. I did a stupid thing
and I'll take responsibility for it.

469
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:09,437
Jack Bristow came to see me earlier.

470
00:36:10,688 --> 00:36:13,607
I told him
about Sydney's transfer time.

471
00:36:16,485 --> 00:36:17,528
When?

472
00:36:23,659 --> 00:36:24,702
You alright?

473
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:29,915
You didn't think about it. Not once.

474
00:36:29,999 --> 00:36:33,252
The possibility that Rambaldi
could be right about me.

475
00:36:33,836 --> 00:36:36,297
- No, I didn't.
- Why not?

476
00:36:37,256 --> 00:36:38,966
Cos I believe in you.

477
00:36:40,551 --> 00:36:44,513
Did you think
I'd just throw anyone in my trunk?

478
00:36:44,597 --> 00:36:47,016
Transportation say
four vehicles are out.

479
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:49,643
I have their makes
and licence plates. Ready?

480
00:36:56,108 --> 00:36:58,444
Take that car over there
to Dozier Field.

481
00:36:58,527 --> 00:37:01,405
There's a jet waiting
to take you to Italy. Be careful.

482
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:03,949
You too.

483
00:37:26,347 --> 00:37:28,849
No.

484
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,324
LAPD is in pursuit of a blue sedan.

485
00:38:27,408 --> 00:38:30,786
- Every day there's one of these.
- They're stupid.

486
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:34,248
- Why doesn't he give up?
- Totally. He can't escape.

487
00:38:34,331 --> 00:38:35,875
It's stupid.

488
00:39:17,082 --> 00:39:18,959
Switch your engine off now!

489
00:39:20,252 --> 00:39:21,504
Look at that guy.

490
00:39:21,587 --> 00:39:26,092
It's the part where he gets out of
his car and surrenders, every time.

491
00:40:16,308 --> 00:40:17,977
Oh, my God!

492
00:42:35,114 --> 00:42:37,533
- Yeah?
- It's me.

493
00:42:37,616 --> 00:42:39,827
- Where are you?
- I need to see you now.

494
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,305
What happened?

495
00:42:59,388 --> 00:43:01,807
The plane is ready.
You need to go now.

496
00:43:01,891 --> 00:43:05,019
I know,
but I needed to see you first.

497
00:43:06,937 --> 00:43:09,982
I just drove a car into the ocean.

498
00:43:10,065 --> 00:43:12,234
I knew the police
were waiting for me.

499
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:13,944
I used the air from the tyres.

500
00:43:14,028 --> 00:43:17,281
I was breathing under water
for ten minutes before I swam.

501
00:43:18,407 --> 00:43:21,535
And as that car started
to fill with water,

502
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:26,707
I knew what my mother had done
in the same situation.

503
00:43:26,791 --> 00:43:29,001
- She could have planned it.
- Sydney.

504
00:43:29,085 --> 00:43:31,420
It makes sense.

505
00:43:31,504 --> 00:43:34,507

506
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:35,758
Ruthless.

507

510
00:43:48,562 --> 00:43:51,065

Mom's alive.

512
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:02,952
I know it.
