00:00:00,782 --> 00:00:02,770
I mean, there's a stream
to the Russian S.V.R.,

2
00:00:02,818 --> 00:00:05,109
a European pharmaceutical conglomerate,
the C.D.C.

3
00:00:05,765 --> 00:00:06,807
They are government.

4
00:00:06,815 --> 00:00:10,791
Marshall counted 12 sources
that make up Prophet Five. 12, dad.

5
00:00:11,317 --> 00:00:12,367
My daughter...

6
00:00:13,522 --> 00:00:15,137
when will she be cured?

7
00:00:15,317 --> 00:00:16,190
Soon.

8
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:17,878
Perhaps you could be
a bit more specific.

9
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:18,890
I wish I could...

10
00:00:19,265 --> 00:00:21,885
But there are a few more things
we need you to do first.

11
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,682
You have a baby girl.

15
00:00:51,128 --> 00:00:53,338
I'd apologize for the method
of transport,

16
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:55,942
but I'm sure you understand
our need for discretion.

17
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:59,618
And I am not in a position
to simply disappear

18
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:02,914
for an extended period of time
without raising concern.

19
00:01:03,816 --> 00:01:06,289
Some advance warning
would have been preferred.

20
00:01:06,443 --> 00:01:07,343
Yes...

21
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,932
but then that would spoil all the fun.

22
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,393
We have some business
which requires your immediate attention.

23
00:01:21,505 --> 00:01:23,877
But I can assure you,
we'll have you back in Los Angeles

24
00:01:23,878 --> 00:01:26,962
before your co-workers
even realize that you've gone.

25
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,770
It's not your timetable
that troubles me, Joseph.

26
00:01:30,128 --> 00:01:31,075
It's your manners.

27
00:01:32,755 --> 00:01:33,655
Here you are.

28
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:38,286
You're not joining us?

29
00:01:38,317 --> 00:01:40,106
The 12 are waiting for you inside.

30
00:01:41,695 --> 00:01:43,852
You're not allowed in that room,
are you?

31
00:02:12,681 --> 00:02:14,042
Mr. Sloane.

32
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:15,749
It's an honor to meet you.

33
00:02:16,256 --> 00:02:18,834
We've been admirers of yours
for quite some time.

34
00:02:19,256 --> 00:02:20,156
Gentlemen.

35
00:02:21,382 --> 00:02:25,329
We'd like to thank you for all the work
you've done thus far on our behalf.

36
00:02:25,942 --> 00:02:27,753
I'm not certain I have much choice.

37
00:02:27,754 --> 00:02:31,460
Not to get into a free will debate
right now, Mr. Sloane, but...

38
00:02:32,146 --> 00:02:34,258
you've always had a choice.

39
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,968
This is our most recent medical report
on your daughter, Nadia.

40
00:02:39,501 --> 00:02:41,909
As you're aware,
we have the capabilities

41
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,228
to restore her health.

42
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,783
And we're prepared to do so
on a permanent basis,

43
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:49,756
provided of course you complete
one final assignment for us.

44
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:53,754
No, I've heard such promises
for some time now.

45
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:56,685
Tell me, what guarantees do I have

46
00:02:56,686 --> 00:02:58,818
that this is the last
you'll require of me?

47
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:00,029
Look around you, Arvin.

48
00:03:01,068 --> 00:03:02,267
Would we show you our faces

49
00:03:02,268 --> 00:03:04,531
if it were our intention
to keep you subservient?

50
00:03:05,692 --> 00:03:08,218
You've earned the right
to stand in front of us.

51
00:03:09,195 --> 00:03:10,352
We have a job for you.

52
00:03:11,443 --> 00:03:14,390
You'll keep your eye on the endgame,
as you always have.

53
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,384
Because the moment
this assignment is over,

54
00:03:17,568 --> 00:03:19,357
we'll give you back your daughter.

55
00:03:25,193 --> 00:03:26,982
What exactly do you want me to do?

56
00:03:29,932 --> 00:03:32,258
This prisoner
is one of the most dangerous inmates

57
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:33,444
we have in this facility.

58
00:03:33,445 --> 00:03:35,392
We don't leave anyone alone with her.

59
00:03:35,692 --> 00:03:37,639
I'm simply concerned for your safety.

60
00:03:37,943 --> 00:03:39,143
Well, that's sweet, but

61
00:03:39,882 --> 00:03:42,776
something tells me
we're gonna get along just fine.

62
00:03:56,132 --> 00:03:58,720
Ms. Espinosa, my name's Kelly Peyton.

63
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:03,247
I work for an independent organization
interested in retaining your services.

64
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,919
Get out of my cell.

65
00:04:05,382 --> 00:04:07,028
If I'm interrupting your busy schedule

66
00:04:07,085 --> 00:04:09,733
of invasive interrogation,
I do apologize.

67
00:04:10,506 --> 00:04:13,611
This facility you're in
doesn't exist on government record.

68
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:18,456
You're being held here without charge,
which means you don't exist anymore.

69
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,597
I can't imagine
that thought's appealing to you.

70
00:04:23,068 --> 00:04:25,224
My employer will secure
your immediate release,

71
00:04:25,225 --> 00:04:26,257
in exchange for which,

72
00:04:26,322 --> 00:04:29,405
you will undertake a long-term,
deep-cover operation for us.

73
00:04:29,507 --> 00:04:32,109
I told you to get out of my cell...

74
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,273
which means if you don't take
your skinny little ass

75
00:04:38,508 --> 00:04:40,359
back down that hallway right now...

76
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,124
you won't exist anymore either.

77
00:04:44,223 --> 00:04:46,150
I don't think you're understanding me.

78
00:04:46,195 --> 00:04:49,931
I'm offering you the chance to get back
at the person who put you here.

79
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,599
I'm offering you the chance
to destroy Sydney Bristow.

80
00:05:01,132 --> 00:05:02,032
Here you go.

81
00:05:15,451 --> 00:05:16,197
What are you doing?

82
00:05:16,198 --> 00:05:17,916
They fell when I tried to put them away.

83
00:05:17,923 --> 00:05:20,851
Sydney, you do not leave edged weapons
within the reach of children.

84
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,442
- She's 4 weeks old, dad.
- Particularly young Bristow women.

85
00:05:23,506 --> 00:05:26,007
She can't even hold her head up.
I think we're safe.

86
00:05:28,196 --> 00:05:29,756
Have you contacted your field sources?

87
00:05:29,757 --> 00:05:32,914
Nobody's heard so much as a whisper
since Irina disappeared.

88
00:05:33,655 --> 00:05:35,683
We should task Echelon
with her known aliases.

89
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,679
We already have.

90
00:05:36,773 --> 00:05:39,291
Rest assured,
we've engaged our full resources

91
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:40,791
in looking for your mother.

92
00:05:41,396 --> 00:05:42,521
Any news of Prophet Five?

93
00:05:42,596 --> 00:05:44,794
No significant activity
in the last few weeks.

94
00:05:47,021 --> 00:05:47,921
I don't like it.

95
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,312
Mom dealt Prophet Five
a significant blow

96
00:05:50,313 --> 00:05:51,466
when she stole the Horizon.

97
00:05:51,523 --> 00:05:53,117
If we aren't picking up activity,

98
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,435
it's only because they're regrouping,

99
00:05:55,436 --> 00:05:57,318
coming up
with an alternate plan of attack.

100
00:05:58,811 --> 00:06:00,914
Try to enjoy your time away.

101
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:05,263
Right now you only need
to concern yourself with being a mother.

102
00:06:05,897 --> 00:06:07,716
As soon as the affairs of the world

103
00:06:07,717 --> 00:06:10,002
require your attention,
I'll let you know.

104
00:06:15,343 --> 00:06:18,333
I need assurances
that Sydney Bristow will not be harmed.

105
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,018
It's not our intention
to kill miss Bristow,

106
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:23,545
if that's what you're asking.

107
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,427
I believe you're overestimating
my ability to influence her.

108
00:06:28,645 --> 00:06:31,867
Even when agent Bristow thought
that I was an honorable man,

109
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,811
she rarely did as I directed.

110
00:06:34,023 --> 00:06:37,694
We're simply asking you
to guide her actions a bit.

111
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:39,130
She's on leave,

112
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:42,325
content to stay at home
and care for her newborn daughter.

113
00:06:43,207 --> 00:06:47,648
I can't task her to re-enter the field
and expect her to follow orders.

114
00:06:50,022 --> 00:06:51,758
- She would need...
- Incentive.

115
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:55,078
I think you'll find, Arvin,
it won't be as difficult

116
00:06:55,134 --> 00:06:57,652
to get miss Bristow
into the field as you imagine.

117
00:07:20,521 --> 00:07:21,421
Will Tippin?

118
00:07:23,396 --> 00:07:25,083
Sorry, I think you have the wrong house.

119
00:07:25,084 --> 00:07:27,391
I'm agent Reeves,
witness security, C.I.A.

120
00:07:27,895 --> 00:07:29,210
There's been an incident.

121
00:07:29,398 --> 00:07:32,187
I'm afraid that your cover
may have been compromised.

122
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,635
Something's happened to Sydney Bristow.

123
00:07:37,272 --> 00:07:38,172
Come in.

124
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:52,207
Sir, is there anyone else in the house?

125
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,648
I was sort of expecting someone.

126
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:55,008
But you're alone now?

127
00:08:04,897 --> 00:08:07,115
All right. I've got him.

128
00:08:39,431 --> 00:08:41,440
Will's home security system
caught the abduction.

129
00:08:41,506 --> 00:08:43,055
- When did this happen?
- Last night.

130
00:08:43,435 --> 00:08:44,931
Will missed his standard check-in.

131
00:08:44,998 --> 00:08:46,857
Have we I.Ded the assailants?

132
00:08:50,952 --> 00:08:52,462
The detention facility reported

133
00:08:52,463 --> 00:08:54,995
Anna was still in custody
as of yesterday morning.

134
00:08:54,996 --> 00:08:57,119
They were surprised too,
to learn she's at large.

135
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,744
- And we're just going to accept that?
- No, of course not.

136
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:02,232
Anna's escape,
plus her knowledge of Will's location,

137
00:09:02,298 --> 00:09:04,747
suggests internal assistance
at the highest level.

138
00:09:04,748 --> 00:09:06,560
Langley launched
a full-scale investigation.

139
00:09:06,561 --> 00:09:07,994
I don't trust anyone else on this.

140
00:09:07,995 --> 00:09:09,807
We've already requested and been granted

141
00:09:09,808 --> 00:09:11,845
the authority
to go after Tippin ourselves.

142
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:14,496
We're only telling you this
because Will is your friend,

143
00:09:14,497 --> 00:09:16,528
and we both know
you'd want to be informed.

144
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,620
We are not asking you to end your leave.

145
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,043
We have this under control.

146
00:09:20,053 --> 00:09:21,807
You don't need to come back to work.

147
00:09:21,807 --> 00:09:24,343
Anna's involvement
is actually a positive for us.

148
00:09:24,484 --> 00:09:26,933
She's too well-known in the underworld
to disappear outright.

149
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:27,454
We anticipate

150
00:09:27,455 --> 00:09:29,176
that she will reveal herself
before long.

151
00:09:30,397 --> 00:09:31,505
We will find her.

152
00:09:31,748 --> 00:09:32,743
Yes, we will.

153
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:43,256
I appreciate your effort
to protect me on this,

154
00:09:43,998 --> 00:09:45,115
but as of this moment,

155
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,284
I'm back.

156
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,531
Would you mind holding
his head steady, please?

157
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,501
He should be awake shortly.

158
00:10:26,768 --> 00:10:28,294
I'll have Anna make the call.

159
00:10:29,627 --> 00:10:31,617
<i>I have the subject you requested.</i>

160
00:10:32,144 --> 00:10:34,706
<i>I'll give you the location
once I receive payment.</i>

161
00:10:34,707 --> 00:10:35,607
<i>The Centurion.</i>

162
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,319
<i>Midnight. Come alone.</i>

163
00:10:38,643 --> 00:10:41,081
Echelon intercepted the phone call
an hour ago.

164
00:10:41,082 --> 00:10:42,502
Voiceprint matches.

165
00:10:42,954 --> 00:10:43,854
It's Anna.

166
00:10:43,955 --> 00:10:45,007
<i>Who's the other man?</i>

167
00:10:45,642 --> 00:10:47,658
We believe
he's a Russian mafia lieutenant

168
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:48,642
named Yerik Semanko.

169
00:10:48,643 --> 00:10:50,906
<i>The Centurion is one
of their known fronts.</i>

170
00:10:51,705 --> 00:10:54,810
<i>Sydney, you're to infiltrate
the club and surveil the meet.</i>

171
00:10:55,182 --> 00:10:57,851
<i>We'll have a support team on standby
to extricate Will</i>

172
00:10:57,852 --> 00:10:59,829
<i>as soon as you ascertain
his location.</i>

173
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,019
<i>Anna will have 'em on alert.</i>

174
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,831
It's doubtful we'll be able
to just walk in the front door.

175
00:11:03,832 --> 00:11:06,568
We will have an insertion scenario
prepared for you.

176
00:11:06,646 --> 00:11:09,315
You'll get the necessary op-tech
as soon as you get on the plane.

177
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,106
<i>Got it.</i>

178
00:11:11,591 --> 00:11:13,545
I gotta go. The baby-sitters are here.

179
00:11:14,892 --> 00:11:17,052
Miss Bristow? I'm agent Rance.

180
00:11:17,456 --> 00:11:18,561
This is agent Dalton.

181
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:19,696
Your father sent us.

182
00:11:19,707 --> 00:11:21,233
He speaks very highly of you.

183
00:11:21,332 --> 00:11:22,588
- May we come in?
- Sure

184
00:11:27,385 --> 00:11:28,580
We've been briefed.

185
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:30,268
You're wheels-up in 82 minutes.

186
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:31,826
That doesn't give us much time.

187
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:37,821
This has all been rather unexpected.

188
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:40,951
It's my understanding Isabelle
is approaching 5 weeks in age?

189
00:11:41,442 --> 00:11:43,128
I would imagine
you have a healthy amount

190
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:45,255
of separation anxiety
towards leaving your daughter.

191
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:46,964
Yeah, I do. Yeah.

192
00:11:47,015 --> 00:11:49,762
In addition to our field officer
training, agent Dalton and I

193
00:11:49,763 --> 00:11:52,000
are both fully trained
in infant development,

194
00:11:52,001 --> 00:11:53,265
including emergency care.

195
00:11:53,489 --> 00:11:55,514
If you agree,
we'd like to go through the house,

196
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:58,957
babyproof it from top to bottom,
socket protectors, safety latches,

197
00:11:59,004 --> 00:12:02,731
gates for the stairs, spread-spectrum
R.F. Detectors, perimeter sensors,

198
00:12:02,778 --> 00:12:05,226
explosive sniffers, all the usual stuff.

199
00:12:08,016 --> 00:12:11,226
Perhaps now would be a good time
to introduce me to Isabelle.

200
00:12:15,328 --> 00:12:17,203
Sometimes she just likes to cry.

201
00:12:23,703 --> 00:12:27,120
It can take her a while to calm down.
You just have to be patient.

202
00:12:27,327 --> 00:12:28,227
May I?

203
00:12:37,695 --> 00:12:40,699
I understand your current assignment
is short-term?

204
00:12:40,954 --> 00:12:43,766
Yeah, I mean, hopefully
she won't even know I've been gone.

205
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:47,060
Oh, no. The mother-child bond
is impossible to replicate,

206
00:12:47,061 --> 00:12:48,933
even by agent Dalton and myself.

207
00:12:49,952 --> 00:12:51,636
She'll definitely know you're gone.

208
00:12:51,763 --> 00:12:54,549
But we'll keep Isabelle safe and secure
until you return.

209
00:12:54,952 --> 00:12:56,162
Thank you, agent Rance.

210
00:12:56,828 --> 00:12:58,249
No need to thank me, ma'am.

211
00:12:58,705 --> 00:13:00,810
I'll give you some time to say good-bye.

212
00:13:11,265 --> 00:13:13,337
It won't always be like this. I promise.

213
00:13:14,577 --> 00:13:18,172
I'm just trying to make the world safer
so you can

214
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:20,370
grow up and have a regular life.

215
00:13:23,182 --> 00:13:25,144
Someone I love is in trouble.

216
00:13:27,703 --> 00:13:29,281
I have to go and help him out.

217
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,542
It's my job.

218
00:13:35,263 --> 00:13:36,775
Mama's gotta go to work.

219
00:14:02,392 --> 00:14:03,979
This is Phoenix. I'm in position.

220
00:14:03,994 --> 00:14:04,852
Copy that, Phoenix.

221
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:08,528
Anna's supposed to meet Semanko
in 53 minutes.

222
00:14:08,562 --> 00:14:09,123
Perfect.

223
00:14:09,188 --> 00:14:12,031
That should give us plenty of time
to I.D. him, wire him for sound.

224
00:14:12,336 --> 00:14:13,801
Sidewinder, what's your status?

225
00:14:13,836 --> 00:14:15,661
Security's pretty tight down here,
Phoenix.

226
00:14:15,678 --> 00:14:16,760
Looks like "A" list only.

227
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:18,360
I'm on it.

228
00:14:43,401 --> 00:14:44,821
Marshall, I'm on the roof.

229
00:14:44,877 --> 00:14:45,714
All right.

230
00:14:45,955 --> 00:14:47,197
<i>Let me know when you're ready.</i>

231
00:14:54,472 --> 00:14:55,452
Relay's in place.

232
00:14:55,648 --> 00:14:58,377
OK. I'm accessing the network now
to get the others into the club.

233
00:14:58,691 --> 00:14:59,688
Uploading...

234
00:15:00,308 --> 00:15:01,136
One...

235
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,140
UPLOADING PHOTO

236
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:04,012
Okay, gang.

237
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:05,199
You're on the list.

238
00:15:20,473 --> 00:15:21,857
Got a guard up top, Outrigger.

239
00:15:21,892 --> 00:15:24,184
- I might need a bit of a distraction.
- Copy that.

240
00:15:24,384 --> 00:15:25,691
I'll see what I can do.

241
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,392
- All clear, Outrigger.
- Thank you.

242
00:16:07,821 --> 00:16:09,172
- I'm in.
- Copy.

243
00:16:16,786 --> 00:16:17,581
Alright.

244
00:16:18,191 --> 00:16:19,226
Let's find our boy.

245
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,194
MILLIMETER WAVE ONLINE

246
00:16:22,205 --> 00:16:24,419
Okay, Millimeter Wave is online.
Here we go.

247
00:16:26,664 --> 00:16:28,170
<i>Marshall, I'm in position.</i>

248
00:16:28,842 --> 00:16:29,697
Got it.

249
00:16:35,818 --> 00:16:37,316
Sydney? Online.

250
00:16:37,384 --> 00:16:38,133
Here we go.

251
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:41,417
All right, guys,
Semanko's making a big payment, so...

252
00:16:42,037 --> 00:16:44,379
<i>We're looking for someone
who's carrying a lot of cash.</i>

253
00:16:56,184 --> 00:16:57,750
Okay, Phoenix, I just take a look.

254
00:16:57,858 --> 00:16:59,119
This guy looks like he's got

255
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,032
<i>a couple hundred dollars
worth of rubles on him.</i>

256
00:17:01,051 --> 00:17:02,672
Definitely not Semanko.

257
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:03,402
<i>Moving on.</i>

258
00:17:20,687 --> 00:17:23,182
We got dollars. We got euros,

259
00:17:23,195 --> 00:17:24,636
We've even got a little Turkish

260
00:17:24,656 --> 00:17:25,977
<i>Lira thrown in there but</i>

261
00:17:26,022 --> 00:17:28,879
doesn't look like anybody's buying more
than a couple drinks tonight.

262
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,420
Wait, hold on, Oracle.

263
00:17:32,471 --> 00:17:35,206
That guy who just passed you
has a loaded Makarov under his jacket.

264
00:17:38,172 --> 00:17:38,972
Scratch that.

265
00:17:39,005 --> 00:17:40,580
We've got three guys with Makarovs.

266
00:17:40,636 --> 00:17:41,445
<i>Three guys.</i>

267
00:17:41,521 --> 00:17:42,545
<i>And the guy in the center</i>

268
00:17:42,553 --> 00:17:45,510
looks like he's got about $100,000 cold
around his waist.

269
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,536
Think we found comrade Semanko.

270
00:17:47,638 --> 00:17:49,136
Sidewinder, do you have a 20 on him?

271
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:50,472
Northeast corner,

272
00:17:50,509 --> 00:17:51,947
<i>near the V.I.P. Section.</i>

273
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,841
Got it. I'm on my way.

274
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,475
<i>Oracle? Keep him busy.</i>

275
00:18:00,066 --> 00:18:01,649
Please, watch where you're going.

276
00:18:01,734 --> 00:18:02,636
I'm sorry.

277
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:04,321
You have my apologies.

278
00:18:04,423 --> 00:18:05,172
Then...

279
00:18:05,308 --> 00:18:07,810
a true gentleman would offer
to make it up to me.

280
00:18:07,844 --> 00:18:09,656
What exactly do you have in mind?

281
00:18:09,711 --> 00:18:10,478
Saskia.

282
00:18:16,344 --> 00:18:18,685
My apologies. My wife she's...

283
00:18:18,754 --> 00:18:20,115
a bit of a whore.

284
00:18:23,286 --> 00:18:24,341
Tracker's hot.

285
00:18:24,443 --> 00:18:25,362
<i>Copy that.</i>

286
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:26,134
Merlin?

287
00:18:26,183 --> 00:18:27,745
<i>He just headed
into the V.I.P room.</i>

288
00:18:28,048 --> 00:18:29,091
Check support teams.

289
00:18:29,154 --> 00:18:31,537
I want 'em ready to move
as soon as we know Will's location.

290
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,008
Copy that. They're on standby.

291
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:35,408
<i>Ms. Espinosa. A pleasure.</i>

292
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,539
- Where's my payment?
- It's all here.

293
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:40,922
Count it if you wish.

294
00:18:41,263 --> 00:18:42,225
Where is Tippin?

295
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,761
Thought I'd make your life easy.

296
00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:45,514
You'll find him in room 147.

297
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,253
Sidewinder, Oracle, do you copy?
Will's in the building.

298
00:18:50,431 --> 00:18:52,040
Copy that. Right behind you.

299
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,349
Would you two come with us, please.

300
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:11,252
Are you okay?

301
00:19:16,077 --> 00:19:17,797
Hope I'm not interrupting anything.

302
00:19:20,682 --> 00:19:22,231
How good is your operative?

303
00:19:22,758 --> 00:19:24,494
We'll find out soon enough.

304
00:19:30,857 --> 00:19:31,725
She hit her.

305
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,308
Begin data capture.

306
00:20:06,261 --> 00:20:07,112
You okay?

307
00:20:07,793 --> 00:20:09,260
Where'd you learn to do that?

308
00:20:09,402 --> 00:20:12,006
Oh, I've just been taking
some Krav Maga classes, you know.

309
00:20:14,108 --> 00:20:15,845
Maybe we'll do this again sometime.

310
00:20:21,325 --> 00:20:22,905
Do we need to send backup?

311
00:20:23,385 --> 00:20:24,789
No, let them go.

312
00:20:25,129 --> 00:20:27,236
We have exactly what we need.

313
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:34,853
Well, so, did they interrogate you?

314
00:20:35,306 --> 00:20:37,995
When I came to, there were a bunch
of people in the room but

315
00:20:38,956 --> 00:20:41,689
they didn't say a word to me.
They just sort of left me alone.

316
00:20:42,224 --> 00:20:44,080
Next thing I know,
you're kicking in the door.

317
00:20:45,843 --> 00:20:47,173
She got you good.

318
00:20:47,472 --> 00:20:48,636
Oh, it's cosmetic.

319
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:50,173
It'll heal.

320
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,403
Listen, you think it's safe
to make a call?

321
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,667
I should probably
let my fiancée know I'm okay.

322
00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:56,377
Did you just say "fiancée"?

323
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:57,373
Did I?

324
00:21:00,487 --> 00:21:01,713
Oh. I guess I did.

325
00:21:01,734 --> 00:21:02,553
Will!

326
00:21:02,607 --> 00:21:03,833
Do you remember that painter

327
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:05,740
that I was gonna ask out?

328
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,830
- Yeah.
- I...

329
00:21:06,847 --> 00:21:07,834
I asked her out.

330
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,357
And what, you're getting married?

331
00:21:09,386 --> 00:21:11,197
Yeah. Well, no, not exactly.

332
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,042
I was actually planning
on asking her last night

333
00:21:14,308 --> 00:21:16,786
before Anna interrupted.

334
00:21:16,957 --> 00:21:18,829
But I'm pretty sure she's gonna say yes.

335
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:20,489
Oh, I can't believe this.

336
00:21:21,117 --> 00:21:23,531
How can you be marrying a girl
I haven't even met yet?

337
00:21:24,103 --> 00:21:25,361
Well, you know,

338
00:21:25,521 --> 00:21:27,364
I think the government-mandated
isolation

339
00:21:27,365 --> 00:21:28,943
might have something to do with it.

340
00:21:30,592 --> 00:21:32,533
Sydney, we haven't spoken in, like,
two years.

341
00:21:32,852 --> 00:21:34,634
What about you? What's been going on?

342
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:40,314
For starters, I have a daughter.

343
00:21:41,336 --> 00:21:44,258
- What?
- Yeah, a baby girl.

344
00:21:44,466 --> 00:21:46,333
Her name is Isabelle.

345
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:51,808
Sydney, are you kidding?
That's incredible.

346
00:21:52,552 --> 00:21:53,834
Who's the father?

347
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,425
Vaughn.

348
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,412
Vaughn, of course.

349
00:22:00,711 --> 00:22:02,772
You guys finally ended up together.

350
00:22:05,715 --> 00:22:07,264
<i>I hate lying to him.</i>

351
00:22:07,808 --> 00:22:10,208
He's my best friend.
I can't even tell him the truth.

352
00:22:11,893 --> 00:22:14,400
You should've seen Will's face
when I told him Vaughn was dead.

353
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:15,520
Sydney,

354
00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:19,474
the only way to ensure Vaughn's safety
is to keep his existence a secret.

355
00:22:19,521 --> 00:22:22,227
- You did the right thing.
- That doesn't make it any easier.

356
00:22:22,312 --> 00:22:25,834
Will's abduction only underscores
our need for absolute vigilance.

357
00:22:26,073 --> 00:22:27,979
We're dealing with a very powerful
opponent.

358
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,166
You think Prophet Five
had something to do

359
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:31,062
with Will's abduction?

360
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,955
There's no logical reason
anyone would abduct Will Tippin...

361
00:22:34,746 --> 00:22:36,380
unless they were trying to get to you.

362
00:22:46,207 --> 00:22:48,897
Relax. The operation is moving forward
as planned,

363
00:22:48,914 --> 00:22:51,382
and may I say that you have performed
admirably.

364
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:53,271
The agreement was for Nadia's cure.

365
00:22:53,662 --> 00:22:56,913
Yes, once the operation is complete.

366
00:22:57,496 --> 00:22:59,819
If I'm to prepare for any unforeseen
circumstances,

367
00:22:59,854 --> 00:23:02,459
I need to know the full parameter
of what you've planned.

368
00:23:02,564 --> 00:23:04,228
All you need to do, Arvin,

369
00:23:04,703 --> 00:23:08,433
is task your team accordingly
when I give you the signal.

370
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,370
And what exactly is the signal?

371
00:23:10,983 --> 00:23:11,842
Believe me,

372
00:23:12,055 --> 00:23:12,864
you'll know.

373
00:23:26,562 --> 00:23:28,451
This is Isabelle.

374
00:23:28,536 --> 00:23:29,718
Oh, Syd.

375
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:33,080
- Sydney, she's beautiful.
- Thank you.

376
00:23:35,483 --> 00:23:38,036
Ma'am, would you like us
to stay on duty for the night?

377
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,500
That won't be necessary.

378
00:23:39,908 --> 00:23:41,508
- You can go home.
- Thank you.

379
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,938
The surveillance equipment's up.

380
00:23:42,979 --> 00:23:43,755
Thank you.

381
00:23:43,886 --> 00:23:44,652
See you.

382
00:23:45,316 --> 00:23:47,137
- You want to hold her?
- Really? Okay.

383
00:23:49,585 --> 00:23:50,415
Hey!

384
00:23:52,613 --> 00:23:53,430
Hey.

385
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,519
I'm Will.

386
00:23:54,843 --> 00:23:56,278
What am I, like an uncle?

387
00:23:56,391 --> 00:23:57,481
- Uncle.
- Yeah.

388
00:23:57,796 --> 00:23:59,089
I'm uncle Will.

389
00:24:01,198 --> 00:24:03,390
Will, we were talking about
what happened.

390
00:24:03,964 --> 00:24:05,986
We have to assume you were grabbed

391
00:24:06,305 --> 00:24:08,135
because someone was trying to hurt me.

392
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:09,730
Yeah? Well, yeah.

393
00:24:09,853 --> 00:24:13,043
I didn't think they wanted me for all
the Lakers statistics I have in my head.

394
00:24:13,138 --> 00:24:14,126
Right? No.

395
00:24:15,748 --> 00:24:17,237
It's... just...

396
00:24:18,767 --> 00:24:20,336
I'm sorry.

397
00:24:20,762 --> 00:24:23,129
None of this would have happened
if I wasn't in your life.

398
00:24:23,448 --> 00:24:25,523
Syd, stop. Are you kidding me right now?

399
00:24:25,709 --> 00:24:27,890
My life is so much better
because you're in it.

400
00:24:34,457 --> 00:24:36,022
ALERT! IDENTIFY DEVICE IMMEDIATELY

401
00:24:36,215 --> 00:24:37,758
Oh, what... Oh.

402
00:24:40,266 --> 00:24:41,070
What...

403
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:43,577
- Sir? Hand over the baby.
- What?

404
00:24:43,726 --> 00:24:44,810
- Agent Rance...
- Ma'am,

405
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:47,440
- take the baby from him right now.
- Okay, okay.

406
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:49,774
What's going on?

407
00:24:50,936 --> 00:24:52,871
- Take it easy.
- What's going on? Hey!

408
00:24:54,418 --> 00:24:55,604
Sydney, what's going on?

409
00:24:55,686 --> 00:24:57,098
I don't know. I don't know.

410
00:25:02,475 --> 00:25:07,040
Well, it's a sub dermal device placed
just below the skull at the brain stem.

411
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:09,357
I've never seen one this small before.

412
00:25:09,903 --> 00:25:12,354
It looks like they patched
a radio receiver

413
00:25:12,453 --> 00:25:14,148
to a powerful microcharge.

414
00:25:16,947 --> 00:25:18,436
So, what? What does that mean?

415
00:25:18,733 --> 00:25:20,494
It means that they... they...

416
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:23,127
- put a bomb in your head.
- What?

417
00:25:23,358 --> 00:25:26,109
I know. I know. But there's good news.

418
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:29,385
It looks like the charge is small enough
that the blast will be localized.

419
00:25:30,838 --> 00:25:31,612
Wait, wait.

420
00:25:31,694 --> 00:25:34,180
- So it might not kill me.
- Oh, no. It'll definitely kill you.

421
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:35,925
There just won't be
any collateral damage.

422
00:25:36,007 --> 00:25:36,804
Marshall...

423
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,266
How do we get it out of him?

424
00:25:38,535 --> 00:25:41,218
Well, we could perform
a surgical procedure, but...

425
00:25:41,729 --> 00:25:43,857
I'm worried there's
a gyroscopic fail-safe.

426
00:25:44,102 --> 00:25:46,884
I mean, there is a very real chance
that if we try to remove it,

427
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,057
Will's head could explode.

428
00:25:50,183 --> 00:25:52,367
Get medical in here.
I want a full extraction scenario.

429
00:25:52,381 --> 00:25:54,894
What? No! Didn't you just hear
what he said about the exploding?

430
00:25:54,905 --> 00:25:55,595
Will, calm down.

431
00:25:55,604 --> 00:25:57,770
Sydney, how can I calm down?
There's a bomb in my head.

432
00:25:57,776 --> 00:25:58,850
Look, don't worry about it.

433
00:25:58,854 --> 00:26:00,390
We're gonna get it out of you. Just...

434
00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:01,310
What is that?

435
00:26:06,475 --> 00:26:07,430
It's my phone.

436
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:09,306
It's just my phone.

437
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,623
BLOCKED CALLER CALLING

438
00:26:12,746 --> 00:26:13,968
Am I supposed to answer this?

439
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,212
Hello?

440
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:19,579
<i>Hello, Sydney.</i>

441
00:26:20,221 --> 00:26:23,431
Now that I have your attention,
I have some demands.

442
00:26:26,347 --> 00:26:27,620
<i>Pay attention, Syd.</i>

443
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,968
<i>You are going to need to do exactly
as you are told.</i>

444
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:35,488
<i>You have access
to the government's</i>

445
00:26:35,639 --> 00:26:37,353
<i>Rambaldi archives at the D.S.R.</i>

446
00:26:37,582 --> 00:26:41,287
I'd like you to bring me
a particular page from his manuscript.

447
00:26:41,444 --> 00:26:42,444
Which one?

448
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:44,690
Page 47.

449
00:26:45,343 --> 00:26:47,284
<i>I'm sure you're familiar with it.</i>

450
00:26:48,554 --> 00:26:50,357
There's a train leaving for Madrid

451
00:26:50,381 --> 00:26:53,249
from the Coimbra rail station
at 2100 tomorrow.

452
00:26:53,752 --> 00:26:55,214
<i>Be on it. Come alone.</i>

453
00:26:55,564 --> 00:26:58,218
<i>Once I have the manuscript page
in my possession,</i>

454
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,036
I will give you the deactivation codes
for the bomb.

455
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:05,575
- Anna, I swear to you...
<i>- Any deviation, Sydney,</i>

456
00:27:05,885 --> 00:27:08,708
and I'm afraid I'll have to blow up
your friend.

457
00:27:08,735 --> 00:27:09,735
<i>Bye now.</i>

458
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:13,294
We have to take her threat seriously.

459
00:27:13,295 --> 00:27:16,044
Marcus, how quickly can you get
page 47 from the D.S.R.?

460
00:27:16,045 --> 00:27:17,645
I can have it within the hour.

461
00:27:17,646 --> 00:27:18,551
Do it.

462
00:27:18,552 --> 00:27:20,316
Of all the Rambaldi artifacts,

463
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:22,145
why would she want page 47?

464
00:27:25,414 --> 00:27:26,503
Who's Rambaldi?

465
00:27:26,738 --> 00:27:29,720
Milo Rambaldi was a 15th century
visionary

466
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:32,622
with an uncanny ability
to predict the future.

467
00:27:32,726 --> 00:27:36,081
His designs have prophesied everything
from binary code

468
00:27:36,139 --> 00:27:39,169
- to nuclear weaponry to...
- is that Sydney?

469
00:27:39,676 --> 00:27:42,937
Not exactly.
There are people that believe that's me.

470
00:27:44,586 --> 00:27:46,272
"Mulier hic picturata."

471
00:27:46,886 --> 00:27:49,297
"The woman pictured here,
the chosen one,"

472
00:27:49,686 --> 00:27:52,862
"will render the greatest power
unto utter desolation."

473
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,008
You're "the chosen one"?

474
00:28:04,176 --> 00:28:06,450
You people really believe this stuff?

475
00:28:07,778 --> 00:28:11,110
We've... seen things that give
Rambaldi's words weight.

476
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:14,593
Guys, can we debate this later...
after the bomb is out of my head?

477
00:28:14,594 --> 00:28:16,348
What's the harm in giving Anna the page?

478
00:28:16,383 --> 00:28:18,593
These are prophecies about things
I might do.

479
00:28:18,594 --> 00:28:20,493
If I don't do them, they're just words.

480
00:28:20,494 --> 00:28:22,309
That's right, Sydney, you have a point.

481
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,957
Without you, that page is worthless.

482
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:26,714
We're not seriously considering
giving into Anna's demands?

483
00:28:26,715 --> 00:28:28,600
- Yes, we--yes, we are.
- No, we're not.

484
00:28:28,647 --> 00:28:30,774
This page will get me close,
but there's no guarantee

485
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:33,074
Anna will deactivate you
if we give her what she wants.

486
00:28:33,075 --> 00:28:35,091
Marshall, can you hack
the detonation frequency?

487
00:28:35,115 --> 00:28:37,921
Well, I mean, she mentioned
deactivation codes.

488
00:28:38,065 --> 00:28:39,793
The bomb and the detonator
are networked.

489
00:28:39,794 --> 00:28:42,143
I mean, maybe I could build a device
that would tap

490
00:28:42,144 --> 00:28:45,207
into the communication protocol,
reverse engineer the codes,

491
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:47,214
but we would need to get the bomb

492
00:28:47,273 --> 00:28:50,289
within range of the detonator
in order for it to initialize.

493
00:28:50,324 --> 00:28:51,322
Get started on it.

494
00:28:51,364 --> 00:28:53,344
But... the only thing
I understood from that

495
00:28:53,379 --> 00:28:55,846
was to get the bomb
in range of the detonator?

496
00:28:55,881 --> 00:28:57,360
You ever been to Portugal?

497
00:29:05,825 --> 00:29:06,928
I'm sorry.

498
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:08,466
It's simply not possible.

499
00:29:10,295 --> 00:29:12,295
There has been a terrible mistake.

500
00:29:12,854 --> 00:29:13,854
Look at me.

501
00:29:14,584 --> 00:29:17,643
I would not know how to purchase
a coach ticket if I tried.

502
00:29:17,678 --> 00:29:20,664
We demand a first-class cabin
at the front of the car.

503
00:29:20,665 --> 00:29:23,390
It is away from the commoners.

504
00:29:23,409 --> 00:29:25,182
Please, there is nothing I can do.

505
00:29:25,229 --> 00:29:26,920
I simply will not allow my wife--

506
00:29:26,921 --> 00:29:30,515
my delicate, porcelain lily...

507
00:29:30,857 --> 00:29:33,194
to be ogled by
the Portuguese wharfmongers.

508
00:29:37,877 --> 00:29:39,965
- Does he speak Portuguese to us?
- I believe so.

509
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,148
It is a dead language. It hurts my ears.

510
00:29:42,203 --> 00:29:45,490
Perhaps our fluent steward speaks euro.

511
00:29:53,026 --> 00:29:54,586
Careful. It's fragile.

512
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:59,027
I hope you find
this cabin to your liking.

513
00:30:01,459 --> 00:30:03,487
Perfectly adequate. Thank you.

514
00:30:06,311 --> 00:30:08,448
Will, "delicate porcelain lily"?

515
00:30:09,082 --> 00:30:11,054
Leave me alone. I was on a roll.

516
00:30:15,216 --> 00:30:17,976
Syd... you know, my girl,

517
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,533
she's waiting for me back home,

518
00:30:19,595 --> 00:30:23,458
and, uh... so depending on
how this all goes down...

519
00:30:25,591 --> 00:30:27,710
- if, uh, I was--
- Will, look at me.

520
00:30:27,764 --> 00:30:29,591
You're gonna make it through this.

521
00:30:29,637 --> 00:30:31,516
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

522
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,240
- I know that.
- Okay.

523
00:30:33,276 --> 00:30:34,967
Wait. What did you think I was asking?

524
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:37,585
I... was just being supportive
in case you thought...

525
00:30:38,157 --> 00:30:39,413
- you might--
- Die?

526
00:30:39,478 --> 00:30:41,368
It's not important.
What were you asking?

527
00:30:41,435 --> 00:30:43,493
I was asking you to be my best man.

528
00:30:44,646 --> 00:30:46,373
- Really?
- Yeah.

529
00:30:46,413 --> 00:30:48,855
Before I realized that
you have such little faith in me.

530
00:30:48,879 --> 00:30:50,199
You thought I was gonna die?

531
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,494
No, I--you want me to be your best man?

532
00:30:52,729 --> 00:30:54,451
Well, I did. Now I'm not so sure.

533
00:30:54,498 --> 00:30:56,956
How would that work, exactly?
Would I have to wear a tux?

534
00:30:56,979 --> 00:31:00,224
You don't have to worry about it,
'cause you're not invited.

535
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:01,464
Okay, we're in.

536
00:31:06,541 --> 00:31:07,640
There she is.

537
00:31:07,979 --> 00:31:11,742
Now I just have to keep Anna busy
long enough to scan the codes.

538
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:15,036
Incidentally, I'd be honored.

539
00:31:16,828 --> 00:31:18,009
Let's do this.

540
00:31:32,336 --> 00:31:33,336
You're early.

541
00:31:33,606 --> 00:31:36,380
I've never been good
at following the rules.

542
00:31:37,377 --> 00:31:40,546
I understand you being
so cavalier about your own life,

543
00:31:40,585 --> 00:31:44,401
but I'm surprised that
you care so little about your friend.

544
00:31:44,907 --> 00:31:45,912
<i>All right, Syd...</i>

545
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:49,484
It's working.

546
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,516
Tell me, Sydney,

547
00:31:50,988 --> 00:31:54,146
what's to keep me
from killing Tippin right now?

548
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:00,017
You've always been a professional, Anna.

549
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:03,689
And I have something you want.

550
00:32:04,928 --> 00:32:05,928
Not here.

551
00:32:07,127 --> 00:32:09,127
Let's find someplace more private.

552
00:32:10,227 --> 00:32:11,812
Okay. So far, so good.

553
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,525
Okay, you're at 38%.

554
00:32:20,616 --> 00:32:21,781
Stay close.

555
00:32:29,939 --> 00:32:32,064
Not a very flattering likeness.

556
00:32:32,506 --> 00:32:35,260
What I want to know is,
why do you want it?

557
00:32:35,879 --> 00:32:37,744
We disproved these writings years ago.

558
00:32:37,745 --> 00:32:40,707
Doesn't really concern me
as long as the check clears.

559
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:45,447
Although I must say
I have had a lot of fun on this one.

560
00:32:46,149 --> 00:32:47,665
Where is the detonator?

561
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:48,960
I don't have it on me.

562
00:32:49,477 --> 00:32:50,517
Wait here.

563
00:32:50,562 --> 00:32:51,582
<i>No, she's lying, Syd.</i>

564
00:32:51,607 --> 00:32:54,989
We wouldn't be able to run the scanner
if she didn't have the detonator on her.

565
00:32:55,612 --> 00:32:57,260
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

566
00:32:57,307 --> 00:33:00,915
Sydney, you know I don't play
by the rules very well either.

567
00:33:01,126 --> 00:33:03,216
Wait here. I'm not asking.

568
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,039
No, we're only at 65%.

569
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,511
<i>You can't let her leave.</i>

570
00:33:19,411 --> 00:33:21,550
Sydney! Sydney, my head's beeping!

571
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,345
You still having fun, Anna?

572
00:34:17,828 --> 00:34:19,206
You'll never beat me.

573
00:34:20,627 --> 00:34:22,979
And you still don't understand the game.

574
00:35:24,816 --> 00:35:26,836
We're collecting her D.N.A. Now.

575
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:28,546
We have begun the process.

576
00:35:30,426 --> 00:35:33,189
You should have genetic samples shortly.

577
00:35:33,748 --> 00:35:36,639
I understand.
There will be no further delays.

578
00:35:47,997 --> 00:35:49,061
Syd!

579
00:35:57,465 --> 00:35:59,204
It's okay. I've got you!

580
00:36:00,497 --> 00:36:02,241
Anna--we have to get her...

581
00:36:04,286 --> 00:36:05,590
I'm right here, Syd.

582
00:36:07,371 --> 00:36:09,463
Looks like you have about 30 seconds.

583
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:47,878
Oh, thank god.

584
00:36:48,234 --> 00:36:49,854
I'm ready to go home.

585
00:37:07,746 --> 00:37:10,085
Sydney Bristow was not to be harmed.

586
00:37:10,124 --> 00:37:11,829
How exactly was Bristow harm?

587
00:37:12,324 --> 00:37:16,618
You locked her in a train car, and
you sprayed her with a chemical agent.

588
00:37:16,673 --> 00:37:20,055
I assume your doctors have given her
a thorough examination.

589
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:23,407
Let me guess--
they couldn't find anything wrong.

590
00:37:23,443 --> 00:37:25,216
I need to know what you did to her.

591
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,270
No, you don't.

592
00:37:26,821 --> 00:37:28,478
All you need to know, Mr. Sloane,

593
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:31,630
is that you've fulfilled your contract
with our organization.

594
00:37:31,777 --> 00:37:32,777
Congratulations.

595
00:37:33,821 --> 00:37:35,526
We've prepared the compound.

596
00:37:36,139 --> 00:37:38,011
Inside you'll find
the necessary instructions

597
00:37:38,046 --> 00:37:40,526
for administering the cure
to your daughter.

598
00:37:42,699 --> 00:37:43,699
It's all there...

599
00:37:44,248 --> 00:37:46,600
everything you need to bring Nadia back.

600
00:37:48,209 --> 00:37:50,856
It's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

601
00:38:08,155 --> 00:38:11,513
We've loaded the Bristow
D.N.A. Template into the sequencer.

602
00:38:11,609 --> 00:38:13,659
Genetic fluid is primed and ready.

603
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:16,208
Good.

604
00:38:17,538 --> 00:38:18,725
How's our subject?

605
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,965
Ready to get this over with.

606
00:38:21,685 --> 00:38:22,974
Vitals are good.

607
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:25,839
The provacillium
should be taking effect.

608
00:38:26,915 --> 00:38:29,488
I've given you something
to help with the pain.

609
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:33,873
If our prior experiences with genetic
manipulation serve as an indicator,

610
00:38:35,238 --> 00:38:38,002
I'm afraid the narcotics
won't be of much help.

611
00:38:38,335 --> 00:38:40,261
I'm sure I've been through worse.

612
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:41,928
I really don't think you have.

613
00:39:08,744 --> 00:39:10,180
They'll give you a panic button.

614
00:39:10,204 --> 00:39:12,517
If anything happens,
I'll be at your side in 30 seconds.

615
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:15,218
- Okay. That part sounds pretty cool.
- Yeah, we'll keep you safe.

616
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:16,558
Syd, don't worry about me.

617
00:39:16,602 --> 00:39:17,777
I can't help it.

618
00:39:19,115 --> 00:39:21,181
I'm sorry you've had to go
through all this, Will.

619
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:23,727
If you apologize one more time,
I'm gonna slap you.

620
00:39:23,774 --> 00:39:25,428
Hey, it's not your fault.

621
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,459
It is, actually.

622
00:39:29,183 --> 00:39:30,435
The people I love--

623
00:39:30,533 --> 00:39:33,969
sooner or later,
something terrible happens to them.

624
00:39:34,069 --> 00:39:36,069
It happens over and over and over.

625
00:39:36,732 --> 00:39:39,106
They're kidnapped, they're tortured...

626
00:39:40,165 --> 00:39:41,257
or killed...

627
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:43,574
because they know me.

628
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:46,046
I feel like I'm this plague,

629
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,233
and everyone I
