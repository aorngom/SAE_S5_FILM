1
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:20,606
I betray them,

2
00:01:20,773 --> 00:01:22,769
I spend the rest of my life on the run.

3
00:01:22,815 --> 00:01:24,224
We can help you with that.

4
00:01:24,315 --> 00:01:25,930
You brought the payment?

5
00:01:27,145 --> 00:01:29,141
I hope you like diamonds.

6
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:45,175
They are planning an attack -- large scale.

7
00:01:45,547 --> 00:01:46,540
Civilian target.

8
00:01:46,632 --> 00:01:47,243
Where?

9
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,800
I'm not sure, but it's on the hard drive.

10
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,070
Everything you need.

11
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,110
Your man is in Los Angeles?

12
00:01:53,483 --> 00:01:54,573
He's ready.

13
00:01:54,804 --> 00:01:57,181
Have him proceed to locker 471.

14
00:01:57,275 --> 00:01:58,363
I'm on the move.

15
00:01:58,735 --> 00:02:02,594
The combination is 8-02-37.

16
00:02:04,743 --> 00:02:10,225
Has he found it?

17
00:02:12,796 --> 00:02:13,789
I have the package.

18
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,198
He's got it.

19
00:02:25,438 --> 00:02:28,818
On the next turn, spin me and cut into the nearest dancers.

20
00:02:28,987 --> 00:02:30,456
Pleasure dancing with you.

21
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:45,405
Carrie, have you seen my shoe? I really need to go.

22
00:02:45,497 --> 00:02:47,064
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I --

23
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,914
Uh... found it.

24
00:02:52,008 --> 00:02:53,239
Who put it in the box?

25
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,443
Okay. Hey, Marshall...

26
00:02:55,815 --> 00:02:57,191
Okay, I'm out of here.

27
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,898
He's warm. He's warm.

28
00:02:58,943 --> 00:03:00,796
- Doesn't he feel warm?
- He just got out of the bath.

29
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:02,023
No, it's not the bath. He's feverish.

30
00:03:02,163 --> 00:03:03,252
There's a temperature nozzle right by the sink.

31
00:03:03,344 --> 00:03:04,670
Looks like a pen. Just point it, and it'll tell you --

32
00:03:04,763 --> 00:03:06,903
- Just feel him. Feel him.
- He does feel a little warm.

33
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:09,259
- Will you hold him?
- I can't take him right now.

34
00:03:09,306 --> 00:03:10,374
Carrie -- Carrie --

35
00:03:11,262 --> 00:03:14,165
Oh, boo-boo. Hold on a second.

36
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,193
- Hello?
- Where are you?

37
00:03:17,287 --> 00:03:20,715
Oh, uh, hi, Mr. Heatherington. It's Mr. Heatherington.

38
00:03:20,854 --> 00:03:22,612
Dixon's en route with the hard drive.

39
00:03:22,658 --> 00:03:24,509
You were supposed to be here an hour ago. Where are you?

40
00:03:24,557 --> 00:03:27,699
Well, you know, we had a bit of a domestic crisis here.

41
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,786
I'm not interested. Get in here.

42
00:03:29,881 --> 00:03:31,494
Okay, abso-- I'll be right in, sir.

43
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:33,868
Thank you, Mr. Boss...man.

44
00:03:34,054 --> 00:03:35,363
You can't go back in.

45
00:03:35,456 --> 00:03:37,070
I have to. The server crashed, okay?

46
00:03:37,162 --> 00:03:38,585
He needs to go to the doctor, Marshall.

47
00:03:38,631 --> 00:03:39,863
Well, then you take him.

48
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:44,051
Listen, Carrie, I'm sorry. I need your help right now.

49
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,854
Have to get to work, okay? Okay, boo-boo.

50
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,590
My contact here indicated Third Faction is planning a large-scale civilian attack.

51
00:04:00,776 --> 00:04:03,489
We'll have the hard drive decrypted by the time you touch down.

52
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,750
Just don't spend too much time sight-seeing in Cuba.

53
00:04:05,843 --> 00:04:07,694
Don't worry. I'm ready to get out of here.

54
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:10,261
Do you have any idea how hard it is to maintain cover

55
00:04:10,354 --> 00:04:12,635
while dancing the salsa in 3-inch heels?

56
00:04:12,822 --> 00:04:15,486
Yes, actually, I do, but let's keep that between us.

57
00:04:15,907 --> 00:04:17,377
You're doing the next intel swap.

58
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,115
I don't care what the parameters are.

59
00:04:19,207 --> 00:04:21,489
Oh, nothing would make me happier. I love dancing.

60
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,127
You hate to dance.

61
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:24,213
How do you know?

62
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,634
I've never seen you dance.

63
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,386
Well, I'm a mysterious man. There are a lot of things you don't know about me.

64
00:04:28,461 --> 00:04:30,219
You've never once taken me dancing.

65
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,878
Okay, let's go dancing.

66
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,345
- Really?
- Yeah, sure.

67
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:36,954
- But you hate dancing.
- And yet I'm taking you.

68
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,231
Like I said, I'm very mysterious.

69
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,694
- You see your driver?
- Yeah.

70
00:04:42,938 --> 00:04:43,814
Have a safe trip.

71
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:57,486
Get down!

72
00:06:48,078 --> 00:06:49,213
I need a med tech!

73
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:53,930
Attention, pathogen alert.

74
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:55,913
This man is down!

75
00:06:56,146 --> 00:06:57,808
Attention, pathogen alert.

76
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,275
I need some help here!

77
00:07:15,781 --> 00:07:16,487
Get back.

78
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:27,972
Jeff, hand these out and make sure everyone gets one.

79
00:07:28,065 --> 00:07:28,723
You got it.

80
00:07:32,977 --> 00:07:34,256
Here. It's atropine.

81
00:07:37,155 --> 00:07:38,099
Vaughn!

82
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,518
Don't touch him! Don't touch him!

83
00:07:39,844 --> 00:07:41,554
Let's get help. Come on.

84
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,717
Here, inject yourself.

85
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:49,334
Clear his airway.

86
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,690
Dixon, it's all right. It's okay.

87
00:07:53,232 --> 00:07:54,302
It should start taking effect.

88
00:07:54,395 --> 00:07:54,957
It's working.

89
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,562
Relax. Breathe.

90
00:08:25,748 --> 00:08:27,362
Schmuck, Alex?

91
00:08:45,185 --> 00:08:47,277
He was under the impression this was a negotiation.

92
00:08:48,148 --> 00:08:49,139
He was mistaken.

93
00:08:50,402 --> 00:08:53,589
Now I don't particularly care who you are and who you work with,

94
00:08:54,056 --> 00:08:56,435
but I'm sure your conspirators will have their hands full

95
00:08:56,481 --> 00:08:58,428
with the hard drive we sent you.

96
00:09:00,484 --> 00:09:00,954
Oh.

97
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,223
All this is for them.

98
00:09:03,735 --> 00:09:05,921
I need him to see what I do to my enemies.

99
00:09:06,434 --> 00:09:08,286
I need him to see what I do to you.

100
00:09:11,512 --> 00:09:13,079
So would it help with your demonstration

101
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,577
if I started crying and pleading for my life?

102
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,554
You obviously don't understand your situation.

103
00:09:19,254 --> 00:09:21,631
He was my friend. You're not.

104
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:26,414
I have something much worse planned for you.

105
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:05,137
Yes, director.

106
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,697
We'll keep you informed on the hour. Right.

107
00:10:07,976 --> 00:10:08,873
What's our status?

108
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,420
Vents have been sealed, air filters are working,

109
00:10:10,512 --> 00:10:12,555
electricity shifted to backup generator.

110
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:15,693
Our cover prevents local emergency responses from intervening.

111
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:18,826
We'll have to wait for hazardous material team to give us a green light.

112
00:10:19,198 --> 00:10:21,577
Until then, proceed with quarantine protocol.

113
00:10:21,716 --> 00:10:23,281
When will the ICU be ready?

114
00:10:23,403 --> 00:10:25,254
Minutes. The hard drive Dixon brought in

115
00:10:25,301 --> 00:10:27,631
exploded after it was connected to A.P.O.'S network.

116
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:30,907
It's possible our computer system has also been compromised.

117
00:10:30,999 --> 00:10:35,383
Right. Then we'll run an emergency diagnostic. Where's Marshall?

118
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:50,169
Flinkman.

119
00:10:50,354 --> 00:10:52,922
Lockdown protocol 4-alpha-charlie. Confirm.

120
00:10:56,944 --> 00:10:57,794
Confirm!

121
00:10:58,073 --> 00:11:01,549
Yeah, sorry. 4-bravo-inkblot, confirm.

122
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:04,724
Firewall networks are secure. We haven't been hacked.

123
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,092
- Is this a drill?
- Unfortunately not.

124
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:09,466
A nerve agent was released inside A.P.O.

125
00:11:09,558 --> 00:11:10,772
We've neutralized the threat,

126
00:11:10,818 --> 00:11:13,578
but our exposure is still a biohazard outside the office.

127
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:15,712
Until we get cleared, no one comes in or out of here.

128
00:11:15,805 --> 00:11:17,514
Okay, okay, I got it. Is there anything --

129
00:11:17,606 --> 00:11:19,076
What can I do? What can I do?

130
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,289
Nothing. Stay on the line. We'll tell you what we need.

131
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:23,186
What the hell happened?

132
00:11:23,747 --> 00:11:24,978
We've been double-crossed.

133
00:11:25,071 --> 00:11:25,968
What about Sydney?

134
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,389
She last checked in before x-fill.

135
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:29,319
Have we confirmed the flight?

136
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:46,974
Hello? Hel--

137
00:12:16,848 --> 00:12:18,270
Sydney, is that you?

138
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,680
Don't hook up the hard drive.

139
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,010
We know. Where are you?

140
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,380
I'm not sure.

141
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:24,963
They...

142
00:12:25,897 --> 00:12:28,228
they dragged me to a cemetery and knocked me out,

143
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:31,156
and I woke up in a coffin.

144
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:34,939
Syd, are you...

145
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,534
Have you been buried?

146
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:39,267
Yes.

147
00:12:41,464 --> 00:12:42,410
Stay calm.

148
00:12:42,736 --> 00:12:43,775
We're going to find you.

149
00:12:44,662 --> 00:12:45,943
What about your contact?

150
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:50,443
They shot him. He's in the coffin with me.

151
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,559
We have CIA family support in Cuba.

152
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:56,316
No, we don't. We're black ops. We're on our own.

153
00:12:56,718 --> 00:12:58,952
You guys have to come get me.

154
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,210
Sydney, the hard drive has been rigged.

155
00:13:02,257 --> 00:13:04,682
It released some sort of a toxin in here. We're in lockdown.

156
00:13:05,008 --> 00:13:05,953
Lockdown?

157
00:13:09,131 --> 00:13:10,173
For how long?

158
00:13:10,685 --> 00:13:13,349
We estimate about 36 hours.

159
00:13:14,938 --> 00:13:16,600
Okay, what are our other options?

160
00:13:18,468 --> 00:13:20,368
Um, excuse me.

161
00:13:20,414 --> 00:13:22,840
I know you told me you would let me know if you needed anything, but

162
00:13:23,587 --> 00:13:24,676
I could do it.

163
00:13:26,077 --> 00:13:27,118
I could go to Cuba.

164
00:13:27,819 --> 00:13:29,702
Wait a minute. Marshall, you're --

165
00:13:29,793 --> 00:13:31,501
you're not in lockdown with the rest of the team?

166
00:13:31,596 --> 00:13:33,208
No, Syd, listen. Mitchell -- this morning --

167
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:36,011
it's a long story. How many bars do you have on your cell phone?

168
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:38,727
Four.

169
00:13:38,821 --> 00:13:39,861
Four. Okay, good. That's excellent.

170
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:42,570
Every cell phone has a distinct radio frequency that's traceable.

171
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:43,606
If we can get a locator --

172
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,931
But there's no way to get the op-tech to you.

173
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:47,305
Well, I could rig one in country, okay?

174
00:13:47,398 --> 00:13:48,678
I mean, the only thing is, Syd,

175
00:13:48,771 --> 00:13:50,288
you would have to stay off the phone while I'm traveling.

176
00:13:50,382 --> 00:13:52,903
You know, just to conserve the battery.

177
00:13:54,491 --> 00:13:56,008
Done. We go with this.

178
00:13:56,147 --> 00:13:58,698
Marshall, there'll be a visa and a passport for you at the airport.

179
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,120
Passport and visa. Passport -- okay.

180
00:14:01,214 --> 00:14:02,398
Okay, I'm going.

181
00:14:04,454 --> 00:14:08,312
Marshall, Sydney has a limited supply of oxygen in that coffin.

182
00:14:08,359 --> 00:14:10,306
We have no margin for error. Understood?

183
00:14:10,353 --> 00:14:14,450
Yeah. I understand. I can do this.

184
00:14:24,504 --> 00:14:26,118
- Sydney, I want --
- No, I get it.

185
00:14:26,256 --> 00:14:28,491
I'm hanging up now.

186
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,838
Reports confirm that ten containers of cyclosarin

187
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,882
were stolen a week ago from a warehouse in Morocco.

188
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,753
They hit us with a drop.

189
00:15:44,848 --> 00:15:47,179
Less than a gram, according to lab analysis.

190
00:15:47,271 --> 00:15:50,794
Third Faction has enough toxin to infect an entire city.

191
00:15:51,214 --> 00:15:52,731
I want their target.

192
00:15:52,825 --> 00:15:55,899
Cross-check all D.I.A. and echelon watchlists.

193
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:59,085
Consult with all of our contacts patrolling major ports.

194
00:15:59,223 --> 00:15:59,930
You know the protocol.

195
00:16:00,024 --> 00:16:01,111
How long has she been in the ground?

196
00:16:01,157 --> 00:16:01,959
Look at me!

197
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,488
Marshall's on his way.

198
00:16:08,796 --> 00:16:11,221
We'll get Sydney out. Make no mistake.

199
00:16:13,043 --> 00:16:15,136
Third Faction wants us on our heels.

200
00:16:15,676 --> 00:16:17,338
They think they can bomb our operation.

201
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,426
They think they can bury our agents alive.

202
00:16:19,547 --> 00:16:21,113
And they think that will stop us.

203
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:25,244
Well, they're wrong. We have a job to do.

204
00:16:26,413 --> 00:16:27,406
Get to work.

205
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:44,252
Uh...uh, uh, do you have a screwdriver?

206
00:16:44,346 --> 00:16:45,863
A flathead screwdriver, por favor?

207
00:16:50,716 --> 00:16:52,854
That can't be regular spanish. That's way too fast.

208
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:54,747
Could you slow down, por favor?

209
00:16:57,004 --> 00:16:57,913
You know what? Never --

210
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,758
Hola. Cómo esta?

211
00:17:10,252 --> 00:17:12,439
All right, she's really starting to freak me out a little bit.

212
00:17:12,486 --> 00:17:13,049
Qué?

213
00:17:13,142 --> 00:17:15,854
Okay, uh, do you have, uh, a radio?

214
00:17:15,995 --> 00:17:16,588
You know...

215
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:19,155
Un radio.

216
00:17:19,201 --> 00:17:20,861
Sí, sí. Un radio, radio.

217
00:17:25,094 --> 00:17:28,678
It's the same... in spanish.

218
00:17:29,425 --> 00:17:30,800
Ahh. Bueno.

219
00:17:33,277 --> 00:17:33,937
Uh...

220
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,411
these your chickens?

221
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,163
Bueno.

222
00:18:48,142 --> 00:18:49,564
Syd, slow down.

223
00:18:51,013 --> 00:18:52,292
Say that again.

224
00:18:52,712 --> 00:18:53,753
We can I.D. him.

225
00:18:53,894 --> 00:18:54,504
Who?

226
00:18:54,672 --> 00:18:57,575
Phantom. My contact. I can send you a picture.

227
00:18:57,809 --> 00:18:59,736
You can check it against airport surveillance,

228
00:18:59,831 --> 00:19:02,541
inbound flights to Cuba. He wasn't alone on it.

229
00:19:03,382 --> 00:19:06,381
Get visuals of the other members of Third Faction and...

230
00:19:07,642 --> 00:19:08,827
track that against...

231
00:19:09,433 --> 00:19:11,095
where they've been and where they're --

232
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:12,552
where they're going.

233
00:19:12,646 --> 00:19:13,734
Send the photo.

234
00:19:21,637 --> 00:19:22,772
Okay, Syd, we got it. We're indexing it now.

235
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:26,054
Vaughn?

236
00:19:26,195 --> 00:19:27,711
Yeah, I'm here. Can you hear me?

237
00:19:28,553 --> 00:19:29,927
I know what he looks like.

238
00:19:31,657 --> 00:19:33,414
Syd, we got the picture. We're working on it.

239
00:19:33,553 --> 00:19:35,931
We can check it against airport surveillance.

240
00:19:37,332 --> 00:19:38,803
Syd, you already said that.

241
00:19:38,943 --> 00:19:39,887
He wasn't alone.

242
00:19:42,271 --> 00:19:44,840
We can find where he's been, where he's going.

243
00:19:58,541 --> 00:19:59,153
Yeah?

244
00:19:59,246 --> 00:20:00,430
Marshall, what's your status?

245
00:20:00,524 --> 00:20:02,948
Well, it's really hot here and everyone keeps calling me "chango."

246
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,082
Marshall, where are you?

247
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,936
We're close. Really close. I've got her signal locked in.

248
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:10,360
We don't have much time.

249
00:20:11,154 --> 00:20:12,195
I understand.

250
00:20:12,287 --> 00:20:12,850
Hold on.

251
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:14,482
Okay.

252
00:20:14,763 --> 00:20:17,905
Okay, senor, turn here. Turn here, sir.

253
00:20:18,557 --> 00:20:20,553
Senor, aquí! Aquí!

254
00:20:22,891 --> 00:20:23,741
Sí, sí.

255
00:20:24,161 --> 00:20:25,440
I took a little spanish in college.

256
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,241
Syd, Marshall's on his way.

257
00:20:44,502 --> 00:20:46,117
We'll be dancing before you know it.

258
00:20:47,052 --> 00:20:48,903
Yet my feet touch the ground.

259
00:20:49,884 --> 00:20:50,925
What was that?

260
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:53,731
Sydney?

261
00:20:54,104 --> 00:20:54,668
Vaughn?

262
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:01,667
My phone is dying. Vaughn?

263
00:21:03,116 --> 00:21:05,262
Okay, aquí. All right, Mr. Bristow, I'm here.

264
00:21:05,341 --> 00:21:07,769
I'm here at the cemetery. Hold on.

265
00:21:08,095 --> 00:21:10,139
Syd, Marshall's there. Hang on.

266
00:21:11,214 --> 00:21:13,161
I just -- I just need to...

267
00:21:14,516 --> 00:21:16,561
Find out which grave she's in.

268
00:21:24,275 --> 00:21:26,796
Syd! Sydney?

269
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:46,106
Okay. Okay. Uh, no. No, no, no, no, no! No! No!

270
00:21:52,702 --> 00:21:53,264
Damn it.

271
00:21:55,556 --> 00:21:56,310
Vaughn?

272
00:21:57,571 --> 00:21:58,134
Vaughn?

273
00:22:07,581 --> 00:22:09,719
4...5...

274
00:22:10,467 --> 00:22:12,224
6...7.

275
00:22:12,316 --> 00:22:14,407
7. There are 7 fresh graves here.

276
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,162
Marshall, you don't have time to dig them all up.

277
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,488
Is there any way to narrow it down?

278
00:22:18,563 --> 00:22:19,747
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

279
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:23,450
Vaughn, can you task a satellite over my position?

280
00:22:27,938 --> 00:22:29,074
All right, I'm here. What do I do?

281
00:22:29,213 --> 00:22:31,447
Well, tasking a satellite from the NRO will take forever,

282
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,516
so go to the config-dot-sys menu.

283
00:22:33,656 --> 00:22:34,601
My phone has GPS,

284
00:22:34,693 --> 00:22:36,402
so you should be able to route the coordinates through the system.

285
00:22:37,617 --> 00:22:38,133
Got it.

286
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:42,035
Okay, now type kh-11-backslash-int-backslash-
therm-backslash-config-dot-sys.

287
00:22:42,082 --> 00:22:43,123
Let me know when you're there.

288
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:44,237
Hang on. I don't see a prompt.

289
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,847
Well, there is no prompt. The prompt's implied.

290
00:22:45,941 --> 00:22:47,076
What, I'm supposed to just type it in?

291
00:22:47,168 --> 00:22:48,591
Yes, god, Vaughn, this isn't that hard.

292
00:22:48,685 --> 00:22:49,821
Well, I've never done this before.

293
00:22:49,961 --> 00:22:52,576
Well, I do it for you people all the time. Now come on.

294
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:56,017
- Okay, I have a visual.
- Okay, great, great, great.

295
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:58,296
The commands I gave you should change the view to thermal.

296
00:23:01,662 --> 00:23:02,798
Okay, wait, I see her.

297
00:23:03,452 --> 00:23:06,259
Eight rows north from where you are, three graves west.

298
00:23:06,492 --> 00:23:08,488
North, west, okay. I'm on it.

299
00:23:09,142 --> 00:23:11,854
No, Marshall, stop. Turn around. Your other north.

300
00:23:18,994 --> 00:23:21,040
Okay, all right.

301
00:23:21,134 --> 00:23:22,669
That's it. It's right in front of you.

302
00:23:22,761 --> 00:23:23,687
I got it. I got it.

303
00:24:06,184 --> 00:24:10,328
Syd? Syd? Syd, can you hear me? I'm coming.

304
00:24:22,442 --> 00:24:24,295
Oh, my god. No. No.

305
00:24:36,967 --> 00:24:37,673
Syd?

306
00:24:37,813 --> 00:24:39,761
Syd? Syd? Syd?

307
00:24:40,508 --> 00:24:43,031
Syd? Syd? Syd?

308
00:24:43,965 --> 00:24:44,720
Oh, my god.

309
00:24:44,905 --> 00:24:45,329
Okay.

310
00:24:48,088 --> 00:24:49,846
1, 2. Come on. Come on.

311
00:25:06,481 --> 00:25:07,251
Okay.

312
00:25:08,138 --> 00:25:10,229
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

313
00:25:16,211 --> 00:25:17,936
Syd?

314
00:25:20,066 --> 00:25:20,535
Oh, god.

315
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:24,116
That's her. She's moving.

316
00:25:28,324 --> 00:25:30,415
Syd? You okay?

317
00:25:32,557 --> 00:25:34,574
- Marshall.
- Yeah.

318
00:25:56,816 --> 00:26:00,961
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

319
00:26:04,421 --> 00:26:05,987
We have an I.D. on the phantom.

320
00:26:06,081 --> 00:26:08,171
Alex Rucker. High-tech specialist.

321
00:26:08,357 --> 00:26:15,176
He was recruited for the Third Faction by this man -- Ulrich Koture.

322
00:26:16,234 --> 00:26:16,939
That's him.

323
00:26:17,313 --> 00:26:19,785
The phantom says another chemical attack is eminent.

324
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:24,261
The assumption is that Ulrich has the intel we need to stop it on his computer.

325
00:26:24,682 --> 00:26:29,734
Sydney, Marshall, A.P.O. is in lockdown for at least another 24 hours.

326
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,106
Your mission is not over.

327
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,722
This picture was taken 10 hours ago at a Berlin airport.

328
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:37,097
Ulrich operates out of a nightclub there. Infiltrate the club.

329
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:40,809
Find Ulrich's hard drive and upload its contents to us.

330
00:26:40,902 --> 00:26:44,283
Ulrich knows me. There's no way I can get close to him.

331
00:26:45,124 --> 00:26:47,434
But we could send in someone else.

332
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,941
I've never been to Berlin.

333
00:27:02,416 --> 00:27:05,558
Make eye contact with everyone, particularly Ulrich's bodyguards.

334
00:27:05,604 --> 00:27:06,262
Why?

335
00:27:06,355 --> 00:27:07,970
You have to convince them you're not scared.

336
00:27:08,062 --> 00:27:10,726
Right. Yeah, I think you're supposed to do that in prison, too, I heard.

337
00:27:10,819 --> 00:27:13,150
The flash drive inside will automatically begin transfer

338
00:27:13,242 --> 00:27:15,766
when you're within range of his computer, but you have to get kind of close.

339
00:27:15,813 --> 00:27:17,045
- How close?
- 2, 3 feet.

340
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:19,417
Syd, this guy, he buried you alive.

341
00:27:19,698 --> 00:27:21,550
Yeah, but he cheated. He hit me with a car first.

342
00:27:21,643 --> 00:27:24,259
- Ordinary cell phone, right?
- Right.

343
00:27:24,445 --> 00:27:25,723
Snap off the back.

344
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:28,810
You've got your barrel, your trigger, magazine.

345
00:27:28,903 --> 00:27:30,469
- The magazine holds two bullets.
- I know.

346
00:27:30,562 --> 00:27:31,794
- Be careful when you load it --
- Syd, I know.

347
00:27:31,886 --> 00:27:35,648
I built that, remember? I mean, I built all this stuff.

348
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,641
- It's different in the field.
- I know.

349
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:41,258
So be careful when you load it, because this is very sensitive up here.

350
00:27:41,349 --> 00:27:42,819
Hold on a sec.

351
00:27:43,754 --> 00:27:44,747
It's Carrie.

352
00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:46,309
Hey, honey. Hi.

353
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,667
What time is it?

354
00:27:48,993 --> 00:27:52,660
Oh. Sorry, uh, how's he doing? Is he okay?

355
00:27:52,753 --> 00:27:54,558
We didn't -- I mean, I didn't realize --

356
00:27:54,837 --> 00:27:57,023
Oh, poor Mitchell.

357
00:27:57,115 --> 00:27:59,160
You know what? Put him on. Yeah, put him on.

358
00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:00,865
Did you try that thing where you --

359
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:01,836
Okay, yeah, put him on.

360
00:28:01,883 --> 00:28:04,738
Hey. Hey, boo-boo. Hi.

361
00:28:05,157 --> 00:28:06,151
Daddy loves you.

362
00:28:06,243 --> 00:28:08,140
Ahem. Hush, hush...

363
00:28:08,496 --> 00:28:11,590
Hush, little Mitchell, don't you cry

364
00:28:11,682 --> 00:28:14,443
daddy's gonna teach you about lanthanides

365
00:28:15,143 --> 00:28:17,759
cerium is first, yes, it leads the way

366
00:28:17,851 --> 00:28:20,499
hexagonal structure, and it's iron-gray

367
00:28:20,918 --> 00:28:23,822
praseodymium is next, and it looks like brass --

368
00:28:23,913 --> 00:28:24,858
What?

369
00:28:25,512 --> 00:28:28,080
No, I can't make it home right now. I'm sor--

370
00:28:28,221 --> 00:28:29,834
Tonight. I promise.

371
00:28:30,114 --> 00:28:32,729
By tonight. That's the best I can do. I'm sorry. Yes.

372
00:28:32,868 --> 00:28:34,769
Yes, Carrie, it's a crisis.

373
00:28:36,264 --> 00:28:37,095
Carrie --

374
00:28:43,733 --> 00:28:45,585
I told her I'd be home tonight.

375
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:47,468
You will.

376
00:28:48,871 --> 00:28:49,672
Okay.

377
00:28:51,073 --> 00:28:51,733
Here.

378
00:28:52,432 --> 00:28:52,996
Right.

379
00:28:54,117 --> 00:28:55,014
Wish me luck.

380
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:15,248
Okay, I'm in. Now what do I do?

381
00:29:15,323 --> 00:29:16,076
What do you see?

382
00:29:16,168 --> 00:29:18,785
Well, a lot of people who are into spanking, apparently.

383
00:29:25,925 --> 00:29:27,845
Oh, my god, I think I just got hepatitis.

384
00:29:27,938 --> 00:29:28,361
What?

385
00:29:28,454 --> 00:29:31,071
This woman who looks like Marlene Dietrich, she just kissed me.

386
00:29:31,444 --> 00:29:32,866
I don't think she's in on it, though.

387
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:35,480
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Okay.

388
00:29:36,228 --> 00:29:38,701
I see a back office. There's bouncers standing guard

389
00:29:38,747 --> 00:29:41,029
and apparently a lot of men with guns.

390
00:29:41,216 --> 00:29:43,450
You can do this. Just remember what we talked about.

391
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:46,731
Eye contact. Now walk up to them and repeat exactly what I tell you.

392
00:29:46,825 --> 00:29:47,627
Thank you.

393
00:29:49,637 --> 00:29:50,439
Okay.

394
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:13,682
I'm, uh...

395
00:30:14,756 --> 00:30:16,084
here to see Ulrich.

396
00:30:16,175 --> 00:30:17,502
Ulrich not seeing anyone.

397
00:30:17,643 --> 00:30:20,354
Tell him Alex wasn't the only one betraying him.

398
00:30:20,587 --> 00:30:23,394
Tell him Alex wasn't the only one betraying him.

399
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:25,416
Ulrich...

400
00:30:28,902 --> 00:30:30,593
This way.

401
00:30:43,639 --> 00:30:44,490
Thank you.

402
00:30:44,582 --> 00:30:45,909
Okay.

403
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,886
Mr. Koture, thank you for taking the time to --

404
00:30:51,979 --> 00:30:52,495
Stop.

405
00:30:53,272 --> 00:30:54,407
I don't know who you are,

406
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,448
and you're distracting me at a critical juncture,

407
00:30:56,543 --> 00:30:59,350
so I hope you have something interesting to tell me, mr...

408
00:30:59,489 --> 00:31:00,577
Okay, this guy's a blowhard.

409
00:31:01,323 --> 00:31:02,460
Bristow.

410
00:31:02,786 --> 00:31:03,761
Jack Bristow.

411
00:31:03,853 --> 00:31:04,894
That's -- that's good.

412
00:31:05,362 --> 00:31:08,501
And if I'm wasting your time by being polite,

413
00:31:09,437 --> 00:31:11,097
I'm happy to walk out of here.

414
00:31:11,191 --> 00:31:12,470
Wait, don't go overboard.

415
00:31:12,656 --> 00:31:14,937
Just don't call me when the Third Faction goes down in flames.

416
00:31:14,984 --> 00:31:16,263
Don't mention Third Faction!

417
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:27,347
You said you had information about my men. Now what is it?

418
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:29,620
Marshall, I'm not getting a reading from the flash drive.

419
00:31:29,713 --> 00:31:31,900
Get the case closer to Ulrich's computer.

420
00:31:36,267 --> 00:31:38,215
- Cigarette?
- No thanks.

421
00:31:51,308 --> 00:31:55,453
I have some... conversations on tape.

422
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:57,542
Perfect. And just keep that going for two minutes.

423
00:31:57,635 --> 00:31:59,487
Tell him he's mentioned on the tapes.

424
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,526
You're mentioned on those tapes.

425
00:32:01,992 --> 00:32:03,702
My men would never go to the government.

426
00:32:03,795 --> 00:32:06,795
No, but they would sell you out to the Slobodan Wolves.

427
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:10,267
No, but they would sell you out to the Slobodan Wolf.

428
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:11,972
- Wolves.
- Wolves.

429
00:32:12,673 --> 00:32:15,146
So, who -- who's doing this?

430
00:32:16,033 --> 00:32:17,886
Dietrich Gustof, his third in command.

431
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:19,259
Dietrich Gustof,

432
00:32:19,912 --> 00:32:21,479
your third in command.

433
00:32:22,367 --> 00:32:24,075
I'm confused by something.

434
00:32:24,215 --> 00:32:26,020
You say you have these recordings,

435
00:32:27,189 --> 00:32:29,566
and Dietrich, well, he only speaks german.

436
00:32:29,892 --> 00:32:30,600
So?

437
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,206
Doesn't that mean...

438
00:32:43,896 --> 00:32:46,226
Okay, he just insulted you. Now say...

439
00:32:50,856 --> 00:32:52,325
I work for myself.

440
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:54,877
And as for these tapes,

441
00:32:55,438 --> 00:32:57,625
it's none of your business how I got them.

442
00:32:57,763 --> 00:32:58,898
And my german...

443
00:33:04,715 --> 00:33:06,091
Now laugh like it's all a big joke.

444
00:33:10,673 --> 00:33:12,143
Uh, Syd, we've got a problem.

445
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:12,752
What is it?

446
00:33:12,892 --> 00:33:14,553
The hard drive's connected to network firewall.

447
00:33:14,646 --> 00:33:16,193
Everything you're sending us is encrypted.

448
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:18,807
But hold on. I'm checking all the computer shipments to your location.

449
00:33:18,901 --> 00:33:21,372
If we can figure out the system, we might be able to bypass it.

450
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,651
All right, mr. Bristow.

451
00:33:23,164 --> 00:33:25,924
Bring me that tape, and we'll cut a deal.

452
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,251
Marshall, we've hit a glitch. Stall.

453
00:33:28,998 --> 00:33:30,611
Okay, Syd, we've isolated the firewall.

454
00:33:30,685 --> 00:33:31,917
It's located in the basement of the club.

455
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,242
- I'm on my way.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait.

456
00:33:33,335 --> 00:33:35,092
The firewall is biometrically linked to Ulrich.

457
00:33:35,186 --> 00:33:36,703
You have to get him down there to disable it.

458
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,983
Marshall, change of plans. The hard drive is encrypted.

459
00:33:39,075 --> 00:33:42,028
We need Ulrich in the basement to shut down a network firewall.

460
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:46,396
I'm afraid we can't do that just yet.

461
00:33:46,535 --> 00:33:48,913
Nein? Is there some sort of problem?

462
00:33:49,034 --> 00:33:50,388
Marshall, you have a gun. Use it.

463
00:33:50,527 --> 00:33:52,858
Get him to the elevator. I'll meet you in the basement.

464
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,558
You know what they say.

465
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,006
Never discuss money on your first meeting.

466
00:33:58,313 --> 00:34:01,100
Well, I sort of need to settle on a fee first.

467
00:34:01,195 --> 00:34:03,285
We will negotiate that after I see what you have.

468
00:34:03,424 --> 00:34:04,560
Afraid I can't do that.

469
00:34:05,072 --> 00:34:07,307
Kind of a policy I have. Cash up front.

470
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,539
Not really a policy, per se.

471
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:11,772
More of a been burned by too many

472
00:34:11,866 --> 00:34:15,102
fly-by-night terrorists to trust them sort of thing.

473
00:34:15,336 --> 00:34:18,285
You know, one day they say "we'll pay you in gold,"

474
00:34:18,332 --> 00:34:21,284
the next they say, "did we say gold? We meant --"

475
00:34:24,089 --> 00:34:25,463
Marshall, are you okay?

476
00:34:26,304 --> 00:34:27,250
Oh, my god.

477
00:34:27,481 --> 00:34:30,815
Syd, I think I just killed Ulrich.

478
00:34:34,743 --> 00:34:35,258
Syd!

479
00:34:35,379 --> 00:34:37,184
Syd, I need your help now.

480
00:34:37,278 --> 00:34:38,603
Hang in there. I'm on my way.

481
00:34:38,883 --> 00:34:40,716
What type of biometric scanner are they dealing with?

482
00:34:40,902 --> 00:34:41,895
Retinal.

483
00:34:42,829 --> 00:34:44,348
Marshall, can you hear me?

484
00:34:44,627 --> 00:34:46,335
Hey, Mr. Bristow. Listen, I'm really sorry.

485
00:34:46,428 --> 00:34:47,946
It was an accident. I didn't mean to shoot --

486
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:49,461
Marshall, we are going through with this mission.

487
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,784
Look around. Do you see any sort of cutting tool?

488
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:53,392
A knife of some sort, or --

489
00:34:53,952 --> 00:34:54,563
No.

490
00:34:54,749 --> 00:34:56,794
Look on the desk. Is there a letter opener?

491
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:57,871
Uh...

492
00:34:59,506 --> 00:35:01,072
Yeah. Got it. Why?

493
00:35:01,568 --> 00:35:03,258
You have to cut out Ulrich's eyes.

494
00:35:05,035 --> 00:35:05,883
Oh, my god.

495
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:09,212
The biometric scanner in the basement operates off Ulrich's retinas.

496
00:35:09,352 --> 00:35:10,250
No. No, I --

497
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,284
You don't have time to get his body into the basement.

498
00:35:12,425 --> 00:35:14,132
Mr. Bristow, no, I can't do that. I'm sorry.

499
00:35:14,224 --> 00:35:15,456
Yes, you can.

500
00:35:16,391 --> 00:35:17,574
I can talk you through it.

501
00:35:20,286 --> 00:35:21,040
Okay.

502
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:23,411
All right.

503
00:35:51,612 --> 00:35:52,747
I'm ready. Go ahead.

504
00:35:52,841 --> 00:35:54,787
You have to go under the eye and sever the optic nerve.

505
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:57,738
- Okay.
- Brace the head.

506
00:35:57,831 --> 00:36:00,019
The bundle is denser than you think it's going to be.

507
00:36:00,437 --> 00:36:01,478
All right.

508
00:36:01,851 --> 00:36:03,703
Here -- here we go.

509
00:36:15,255 --> 00:36:18,205
Oh, god, it's oozing. It's oozing everywhere, sir.

510
00:36:18,392 --> 00:36:20,340
That means you've ruptured the macula.

511
00:36:21,228 --> 00:36:23,367
The eye is useless. Abandon it.

512
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:26,306
Approach the second one gently,

513
00:36:26,446 --> 00:36:28,154
like a soft boiled egg.

514
00:36:28,601 --> 00:36:31,647
You're going to need a digging instrument to assist with this.

515
00:36:33,786 --> 00:36:35,740
I got a spork.

516
00:36:36,162 --> 00:36:37,440
What's a spork?

517
00:36:37,533 --> 00:36:40,436
It's like a half spoon, half fork. Will that do?

518
00:36:40,512 --> 00:36:41,266
That will work.

519
00:36:41,452 --> 00:36:43,973
Okay. Okay. Okay.

520
00:36:48,882 --> 00:36:50,763
All right.

521
00:36:50,858 --> 00:36:51,898
Soft boiled egg.

522
00:36:52,972 --> 00:36:53,775
Soft...

523
00:37:12,902 --> 00:37:13,656
Done.

524
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:24,841
Come on.

525
00:37:40,465 --> 00:37:42,222
Here, you do it. I can't look at it anymore.

526
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:03,512
How much time do you need?

527
00:38:03,651 --> 00:38:04,357
15 seconds.

528
00:38:08,378 --> 00:38:09,564
Marshall, it's working.

529
00:38:14,754 --> 00:38:15,365
I'm out.

530
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,566
Syd.

531
00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:22,527
Got it.

532
00:38:31,507 --> 00:38:33,455
Okay, we've got a location on the bomb -- Hong Kong.

533
00:38:33,641 --> 00:38:35,590
I'm alerting the local CIA offices now.

534
00:38:38,254 --> 00:38:40,155
Sydney, are you and Marshall all right?

535
00:38:40,995 --> 00:38:41,749
We're fine.

536
00:38:51,851 --> 00:38:53,752
The ministry of security confirmed the seizure

537
00:38:53,796 --> 00:38:56,079
of a cyclosarin bomb in downtown Hong Kong.

538
00:38:56,172 --> 00:38:58,311
They have expressed their gratitude to Langley.

539
00:38:58,404 --> 00:39:02,166
Third Faction's operation extended far beyond our original estimate.

540
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:04,206
The hard drive that Marshall downloaded

541
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,537
contained hundreds of names of contacts throughout Europe and Asia,

542
00:39:07,723 --> 00:39:09,957
which we will have to confirm.

543
00:39:10,143 --> 00:39:12,073
Start with all arms-related activities.

544
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:14,449
Don't limit your parameters to chemical weapons.

545
00:39:18,657 --> 00:39:20,461
So where are we?

546
00:39:25,045 --> 00:39:27,422
Third Faction had few political affiliations.

547
00:39:27,562 --> 00:39:32,664
Their primary interest was maximizing profit off of terrorist activities...

548
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:49,061
These are not the clothes I left the house in.

549
00:39:49,152 --> 00:39:50,272
What do I tell Carrie?

550
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:52,501
Maybe you had spare clothes at the office.

551
00:39:56,943 --> 00:39:59,369
I hate lying to her, Syd.

552
00:40:00,584 --> 00:40:01,433
Syd...

553
00:40:02,397 --> 00:40:04,153
I hate lying to Carrie.

554
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:06,261
I know.

555
00:40:07,381 --> 00:40:09,471
Part of the job though, right?

556
00:40:10,201 --> 00:40:11,719
Well, you could tell her the truth --

557
00:40:12,468 --> 00:40:15,035
That you had to cut out a man's eyes to save the world.

558
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,200
Yeah. I could tell her that.

559
00:40:18,854 --> 00:40:21,614
Probably be best just to keep that between us.

560
00:40:23,484 --> 00:40:25,526
And I didn't save the world exactly.

561
00:40:25,621 --> 00:40:26,805
Just Hong Kong.

562
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,673
You saved me.

563
00:40:31,776 --> 00:40:32,606
Yeah.

564
00:40:34,194 --> 00:40:35,808
All in a day's work.

565
00:40:40,345 --> 00:40:41,290
Anyway...

566
00:40:41,896 --> 00:40:44,656
you want to come in and get some dinner with us?

567
00:40:44,888 --> 00:40:47,649
Yeah, and how would we explain that I drove you home?

568
00:40:47,788 --> 00:40:49,163
I don't know, we could come up with something.

569
00:40:49,256 --> 00:40:51,921
We're quick on our feet. We're spies.

570
00:40:52,013 --> 00:40:53,054
Thank you, but...

571
00:40:54,316 --> 00:40:56,360
I need to go wait at the train station.

572
00:40:58,369 --> 00:40:59,840
There's someone I need to see.

573
00:41:01,616 --> 00:41:02,513
Yeah.

574
00:41:03,447 --> 00:41:04,440
I know the feeling.

575
00:41:07,993 --> 00:41:08,892
I'll see you tomorrow?

576
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:09,877
Okay.

577
00:41:13,383 --> 00:41:13,994
Bye.

578
00:42:30,383 --> 00:42:32,694
