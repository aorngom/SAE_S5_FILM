1
00:00:00,929 --> 00:00:01,768
Previously on Alias.

2
00:00:01,862 --> 00:00:04,333
Our target is someone with whom several of you are quite familiar.

3
00:00:04,426 --> 00:00:05,371
Who is it?

4
00:00:06,118 --> 00:00:07,587
Anna Espinosa.

5
00:00:08,615 --> 00:00:09,684
I thought --

6
00:00:10,807 --> 00:00:13,803
- She's supposed to be dead.
- So are a lot of people.

7
00:00:18,713 --> 00:00:19,417
Here.

8
00:00:20,726 --> 00:00:21,623
Nice work.

9
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,870
It was nice getting to know your sister.

10
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:27,768
Get your hands off me.

11
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,330
Dispatch, I need backup.

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,890
She can have the blouse.

13
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,410
I believe that if the two of you go out on this mission,

14
00:00:45,603 --> 00:00:47,692
and Anna Espinosa has her way,

15
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:52,453
that only one of you will return home alive.

16
00:00:55,304 --> 00:00:57,253
- Let's take her.
- Bad idea.

17
00:00:58,701 --> 00:01:00,790
I was hoping we could spend a little more --

18
00:01:04,343 --> 00:01:05,288
Go!

19
00:01:19,923 --> 00:01:21,920
Why is the CRF assembling this bomb?

20
00:01:22,058 --> 00:01:23,099
What do they have planned?

21
00:01:41,613 --> 00:01:43,657
Oh, my god, I thought you were... Anna.

22
00:02:19,144 --> 00:02:21,858
The surgeons in Estonia got the bullet out.

23
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:23,752
She's stabilized.

24
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:26,400
But the internal bleeding was severe.

25
00:02:31,449 --> 00:02:33,300
They put her in a coma.

26
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,009
Until she recovers minimum metabolic function.

27
00:02:36,195 --> 00:02:39,001
48 hours at least, they say.

28
00:02:44,118 --> 00:02:45,110
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:46,558 --> 00:02:48,507
It was Anna Espinosa.

30
00:02:50,282 --> 00:02:51,751
She did this.

31
00:02:52,593 --> 00:02:56,926
Anna has got the bomb.

32
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:59,345
We didn't stop her.

33
00:03:02,664 --> 00:03:04,517
I said I'm not to be bothered.

34
00:03:08,632 --> 00:03:09,817
I'll be right there.

35
00:04:16,616 --> 00:04:18,276
This is...

36
00:04:18,696 --> 00:04:20,022
classic.

37
00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:23,525
Is this really the only way to get intel on CRF?

38
00:04:23,618 --> 00:04:25,088
You disagree with my methods.

39
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,249
Sloane signed an agreement with Langley.

40
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,670
He's prohibited from engaging with certain operatives.

41
00:04:30,765 --> 00:04:31,975
Sark's on that list.

42
00:04:32,115 --> 00:04:36,163
Sark will only negotiate openly if he feels he's met his intellectual match.

43
00:04:36,302 --> 00:04:38,728
As acting director, I'll take full responsibility.

44
00:04:39,522 --> 00:04:41,660
Four years ago, if I'm not mistaken,

45
00:04:41,753 --> 00:04:44,655
you fooled a small army into thinking they worked for the CIA,

46
00:04:44,748 --> 00:04:47,650
when in fact they worked for you.

47
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,403
How you convinced the U.S. Government

48
00:04:49,496 --> 00:04:53,832
into offering you the real thing is a story I'm dying to hear.

49
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:58,959
Suffice to say, Arvin, you have my undying admiration.

50
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:08,842
You recognize those men?

51
00:05:10,383 --> 00:05:13,286
They were going to help you escape our custody in Johannesburg.

52
00:05:14,968 --> 00:05:16,008
Turn the page.

53
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,424
An abject lesson.

54
00:05:25,123 --> 00:05:29,888
This is what we will do to you if you refuse to cooperate.

55
00:05:30,636 --> 00:05:34,349
Now, how do we retrieve the bomb?

56
00:05:37,761 --> 00:05:42,668
The Cadmus Revolutionary Front is run by a man named Ushek San'ko.

57
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:45,377
We worked together under my last employer.

58
00:05:45,423 --> 00:05:47,991
San'ko will be taking possession of the bomb shortly.

59
00:05:48,037 --> 00:05:48,599
I've got him.

60
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,549
I told M. Vaughn in Johannesburg I would help you infiltrate CRF

61
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:55,783
and retrieve this bomb from San'ko.

62
00:05:56,296 --> 00:06:00,201
And I promise you, I will. You have my word.

63
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:01,429
Your word?

64
00:06:01,522 --> 00:06:03,232
Which has a considerably greater value

65
00:06:03,603 --> 00:06:05,790
than when you knew me last.

66
00:06:06,163 --> 00:06:09,351
Incarceration has given me a sense of...

67
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,142
perspective.

68
00:06:11,748 --> 00:06:13,839
Well, I'll consider that.

69
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:16,902
But first I have a demand.

70
00:06:18,192 --> 00:06:20,761
I've heard from unreliable sources that

71
00:06:20,946 --> 00:06:24,135
Lauren Reed is dead.

72
00:06:24,508 --> 00:06:27,123
Now I've filed numerous requests about her status.

73
00:06:27,403 --> 00:06:29,731
All have gone unanswered.

74
00:06:31,134 --> 00:06:35,659
What I want is to visit her grave.

75
00:06:36,593 --> 00:06:39,353
I want to see her body for myself.

76
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:45,638
I'll arrange transport.

77
00:06:50,313 --> 00:06:52,547
There's something else.

78
00:06:54,978 --> 00:06:56,447
I heard about Sark.

79
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,249
He didn't give you anything in South Africa.

80
00:06:58,342 --> 00:06:59,860
No, he was onto us from the beginning.

81
00:07:00,513 --> 00:07:01,746
They're questioning him now.

82
00:07:02,071 --> 00:07:05,117
If Sark can give us intel on how to stop the CRF, we still have a chance.

83
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,443
We can't depend on Sark.

84
00:07:06,862 --> 00:07:08,524
I understand he's cutting a deal.

85
00:07:09,785 --> 00:07:11,255
Look, I don't like it any more than you do,

86
00:07:11,394 --> 00:07:13,199
but if listening to him helps us get the bomb back,

87
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,333
I can live with it.

88
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,798
Even if you're right,

89
00:07:17,013 --> 00:07:18,626
what if Anna gets away?

90
00:07:20,636 --> 00:07:24,113
Sark has agreed to lead us to Ushek San'ko, the leader of CRF.

91
00:07:24,206 --> 00:07:26,822
We believe San'ko can provide operational intelligence

92
00:07:26,869 --> 00:07:29,198
that will allow us to stop Anna and recover the weapon.

93
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,142
When do we leave?

94
00:07:30,186 --> 00:07:31,891
He has, however, made a demand

95
00:07:32,058 --> 00:07:33,904
which involves you.

96
00:07:35,743 --> 00:07:38,990
He wants to exhume your wife's body.

97
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,115
Fine. Let him.

98
00:07:45,957 --> 00:07:46,806
That's not all.

99
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,874
Sark has demanded that you open her coffin for him.

100
00:07:51,014 --> 00:07:52,245
N o.

101
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:53,522
Agent Vaughn?

102
00:07:53,616 --> 00:07:54,445
You can't order him too this.

103
00:07:54,491 --> 00:07:56,582
I'm not ordering. I'm asking.

104
00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:00,708
Sark's participation in leading us to CRF, stopping Anna is dependent --

105
00:08:00,754 --> 00:08:02,462
I'll do it.

106
00:08:56,344 --> 00:08:57,862
This is where you keep her?

107
00:08:59,218 --> 00:09:00,258
For national security reasons,

108
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,154
some bodies aren't allowed a public grave.

109
00:09:04,116 --> 00:09:07,163
In this case, we didn't want Lauren's death to become public knowledge.

110
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:26,659
This  make you feel better, watching this happen?

111
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,507
It gives me hope.

112
00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:31,804
That I can still achieve closure.

113
00:09:35,824 --> 00:09:38,087
Guys like you don't believe in closure.

114
00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:40,791
That would actually require you to care about something.

115
00:09:41,397 --> 00:09:43,011
Perhaps that's true.

116
00:09:43,992 --> 00:09:47,324
Perhaps all I can hope for is a moment for us all to share --

117
00:09:47,556 --> 00:09:49,122
you, me...

118
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:50,433
her.

119
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:54,490
And letting go of all pretext and subterfuge,

120
00:09:54,537 --> 00:09:56,436
we can finally admit the truth.

121
00:09:57,418 --> 00:09:59,365
Your wife loved me.

122
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:02,438
Not even death can change that.

123
00:10:04,634 --> 00:10:06,868
Do it. Open it.

124
00:10:10,702 --> 00:10:13,604
You want your moment? Take it.

125
00:10:42,172 --> 00:10:42,974
Stop.

126
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:49,342
My agreement, Mr. Vaughn, allows for this.

127
00:11:13,936 --> 00:11:15,883
In a perfect triangular pattern.

128
00:11:18,081 --> 00:11:20,027
Consistent with CIA training.

129
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,845
It was you.

130
00:11:33,135 --> 00:11:34,366
You did this.

131
00:11:34,786 --> 00:11:36,447
Yes, I did.

132
00:12:11,324 --> 00:12:12,746
I'll take you to CRF.

133
00:12:17,047 --> 00:12:18,947
But I want you to face what you did.

134
00:12:21,751 --> 00:12:22,983
I want you to look at her.

135
00:12:54,915 --> 00:12:57,627
Do a search for black widow. It was one of Anna's call signs.

136
00:12:57,674 --> 00:12:59,621
Who knows? She might still use it.

137
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,041
Dixon, will you call me if you find anything? Okay.

138
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:10,023
Is there anything you need?

139
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:11,288
No.

140
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,828
You shouldn't blame yourself, Sydney.

141
00:13:20,556 --> 00:13:24,222
I certainly don't hold you responsible for what happened to Nadia.

142
00:13:25,483 --> 00:13:27,288
I've said this before.

143
00:13:27,754 --> 00:13:29,415
Anna won't kill Nadia.

144
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,470
She can't.

145
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:36,060
After all this, you still believe.

146
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,800
Sydney.

147
00:13:38,744 --> 00:13:42,649
My daughter lies there in a medically induced coma.

148
00:13:44,192 --> 00:13:48,096
What else do I have but my faith?

149
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,701
All patients and personnel, please remain calm.

150
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,312
We have experienced a small fire in the sub-basement.

151
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:02,164
Please proceed to the nearest exit in an orderly manner.

152
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,727
Should be a security detail in the building.

153
00:14:03,821 --> 00:14:05,531
Stay with Nadia until they get here.

154
00:15:19,801 --> 00:15:20,841
Nadia's next door.

155
00:15:22,102 --> 00:15:25,579
I thought it prudent to change her room until our extraction arrived.

156
00:15:33,107 --> 00:15:34,530
The doctors at the hospital assured me

157
00:15:34,623 --> 00:15:36,954
Nadia will be able to complete her recovery here.

158
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:43,951
Anna came after us, Jack, in a public place.

159
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:45,846
The operative question is, why?

160
00:15:45,939 --> 00:15:47,887
Anna has the bomb. Why come back for Nadia?

161
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:49,737
I don't care about her agenda.

162
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:51,968
That woman is a threat. I want her destroyed.

163
00:15:52,108 --> 00:15:54,437
Your daughter has just been attacked. I understand that.

164
00:15:54,859 --> 00:15:57,474
But this is not the time to react emotionally.

165
00:15:57,566 --> 00:15:58,989
Whatever it takes,

166
00:15:59,362 --> 00:16:00,833
you find Anna.

167
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:04,038
Whatever corners you have to cut,

168
00:16:04,177 --> 00:16:06,076
whatever favors you have to call in,

169
00:16:06,123 --> 00:16:07,020
do it.

170
00:16:07,345 --> 00:16:10,488
But find her. Eliminate her.

171
00:16:11,702 --> 00:16:14,940
And what about your faith that Nadia will survive?

172
00:16:15,593 --> 00:16:19,975
Oh... this isn't about faith.

173
00:16:23,808 --> 00:16:26,710
Well, it took me a while to patch into the security system in Estonia.

174
00:16:26,803 --> 00:16:30,022
The -- mm -- firewall was a piece of cake,

175
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:33,448
but the CCTV was rigged with a fluctuating log-on, and --

176
00:16:34,598 --> 00:16:36,402
you don't really care about --

177
00:16:37,103 --> 00:16:39,479
point is, I did manage to hack in.

178
00:16:39,525 --> 00:16:40,852
By the way, is it just me,

179
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:43,322
or does fast forward make you a little nauseated?

180
00:16:43,415 --> 00:16:44,359
Do we have audio?

181
00:16:44,452 --> 00:16:45,685
All we have is raw video feed,

182
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:49,109
but fortunately I wrote a voice reconstruction program

183
00:16:49,247 --> 00:16:52,962
based on a lip movements a few years ago, and check this out.

184
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,268
Why is CRF assembling assembling this bomb?

185
00:16:56,361 --> 00:16:57,880
What do they have planned?

186
00:17:00,963 --> 00:17:01,958
What did he say?

187
00:17:02,049 --> 00:17:03,997
Well, that I couldn't rebuild.

188
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,321
But look at this.

189
00:17:06,444 --> 00:17:09,919
You see that shadow right there in the background?

190
00:17:10,011 --> 00:17:13,679
Well, I enhanced the detail, and look at that.

191
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,081
That's why anna came after her in the hospital.

192
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:18,257
Excuse me?

193
00:17:18,816 --> 00:17:21,623
I don't under-- you're welcome.

194
00:17:21,716 --> 00:17:23,950
Sark gave us the contact protocol to meet with the CRF.

195
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:25,703
It's a coded message in the classified ads.

196
00:17:25,889 --> 00:17:27,025
If all goes as he says it will,

197
00:17:27,118 --> 00:17:29,353
we should have a response by the evening edition.

198
00:17:29,492 --> 00:17:31,391
And then what? You and I go in alone?

199
00:17:31,998 --> 00:17:34,041
Do you mean is it a glorified date?

200
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:36,791
That's  not what I meant, but is it?

201
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,973
No, not exactly.

202
00:17:38,112 --> 00:17:39,391
We've got to take Sark with us.

203
00:17:39,578 --> 00:17:41,619
He insists we won't get through the front door without him,

204
00:17:41,712 --> 00:17:44,616
so we rely on the explosive tracking device we put in his neck.

205
00:17:44,661 --> 00:17:46,178
If he tries to burn us in any way --

206
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,401
sabotage, escape, whatever --

207
00:17:48,495 --> 00:17:49,679
We take him out.

208
00:17:55,569 --> 00:17:56,417
Hey.

209
00:17:57,866 --> 00:17:59,288
Nadia's gonna make it.

210
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:11,511
You're monitoring agent Santos' progress.

211
00:18:11,837 --> 00:18:15,122
If she were to be awakened from her coma early,

212
00:18:15,682 --> 00:18:17,438
what risks would she be exposed to?

213
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,354
It would increase stress on her circulatory system.

214
00:18:20,961 --> 00:18:23,622
The quicker you revive her, the higher the risk of shock,

215
00:18:23,715 --> 00:18:25,281
heart attack, stroke.

216
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,081
Is there some reason to wake her?

217
00:18:27,922 --> 00:18:29,296
Not yet.

218
00:18:34,766 --> 00:18:36,952
The man we're meeting with, Ushek San'ko --

219
00:18:37,044 --> 00:18:38,466
what else can you tell us about him?

220
00:18:40,288 --> 00:18:43,668
San'ko's expertise is coordinating terrorist activities.

221
00:18:43,714 --> 00:18:45,757
And you're convinced he'll know where the bomb is?

222
00:18:45,895 --> 00:18:48,464
I'm quite certain he's the one that tasked Anna to get it.

223
00:18:48,977 --> 00:18:53,216
Per our protocol, he took out a series of ads in response to mine.

224
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,349
This one here --

225
00:18:54,442 --> 00:18:57,727
it says I'm to meet him at a club in Venice where we've done business before.

226
00:18:57,819 --> 00:18:58,907
He says I'm to come alone.

227
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,705
Alone?

228
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:01,030
That's interesting.

229
00:19:01,263 --> 00:19:04,832
I gave you my word, Mr. Vaughn. Am I to take it you don't trust me?

230
00:19:04,925 --> 00:19:07,206
You're about to betray one of your former partners.

231
00:19:07,486 --> 00:19:09,863
Doesn't really instill faith in your loyalty.

232
00:19:09,956 --> 00:19:13,671
My past infidelities are just that -- mistakes I've learned from.

233
00:19:13,763 --> 00:19:15,280
Repented for.

234
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:17,125
I've become a trustworthy man.

235
00:19:17,265 --> 00:19:20,167
Well, the answer's no. Where you go, we go.

236
00:19:25,589 --> 00:19:26,820
Lauren and I --

237
00:19:26,913 --> 00:19:30,435
we set up a weapons deal with San'ko before the Covenant imploded.

238
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:33,751
The thing is, is he's never met her face to face.

239
00:19:33,938 --> 00:19:35,885
All he knows is her voice.

240
00:20:28,948 --> 00:20:30,130
How's this?

241
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,708
Perfect.

242
00:20:58,611 --> 00:21:00,559
I must tell you,

243
00:21:01,025 --> 00:21:03,402
Lauren and I had a reputation.

244
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:06,674
Certain intimacies were public knowledge.

245
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:08,571
We must maintain appearances.

246
00:21:08,664 --> 00:21:10,993
Dream on, you perverted freak.

247
00:21:11,273 --> 00:21:14,367
Oh. Mr. Sark.

248
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,066
San'ko. It's good to see you.

249
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:19,335
And you must be...

250
00:21:19,522 --> 00:21:21,088
Lauren Reed, mm?

251
00:21:21,928 --> 00:21:25,308
My dear, what a pleasure to meet you after so long.

252
00:21:26,757 --> 00:21:30,471
The pleasure's all mine -- obviously.

253
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:34,304
So, let us toast.

254
00:21:35,426 --> 00:21:37,039
To CRF, mm?

255
00:21:45,453 --> 00:21:46,447
Salud.

256
00:21:52,991 --> 00:21:54,270
Ahh!

257
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:01,292
So...

258
00:22:03,068 --> 00:22:05,110
what is the nature of your business?

259
00:22:05,203 --> 00:22:06,673
You represent certain interests

260
00:22:06,765 --> 00:22:09,314
that stand to profit should the market fall.

261
00:22:10,157 --> 00:22:12,771
If you were to provide us with some insider information,

262
00:22:12,892 --> 00:22:15,556
we would be happy to split the profits.

263
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:17,539
How nice of you.

264
00:22:17,865 --> 00:22:20,576
Information about what?

265
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:24,414
Our sources tell us you've just acquired a chemical bomb.

266
00:22:24,693 --> 00:22:26,115
What do you intended to do with it?

267
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,429
Which weapon are you talking about?

268
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:33,141
The one you hired Anna Espinosa to steal.

269
00:22:34,448 --> 00:22:37,161
Obviously you've never heard of her. Sorry to waste your time.

270
00:22:37,252 --> 00:22:39,010
You want something from me?

271
00:22:39,803 --> 00:22:42,896
I want something from you, my dear.

272
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:44,642
And what is that?

273
00:22:45,715 --> 00:22:48,761
Mr. Sark has told me about your...

274
00:22:49,694 --> 00:22:51,403
predilections.

275
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:54,396
Mm? I have a room above this club.

276
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,510
I'd like to watch that.

277
00:22:58,256 --> 00:22:59,631
For myself.

278
00:23:01,687 --> 00:23:04,064
You have my permission to kill him if you'd like.

279
00:23:04,439 --> 00:23:10,062
I'm sure Julian's told you that we never mix business with pleasure.

280
00:23:31,099 --> 00:23:32,711
I told you she was special.

281
00:23:32,897 --> 00:23:36,946
Oh, yes. She is indeed special.

282
00:23:50,737 --> 00:23:51,395
Anna!

283
00:23:51,703 --> 00:23:52,457
Above us.

284
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:55,316
I'll take the lead. We'll cover each other's corners.

285
00:23:56,576 --> 00:23:58,095
Give me a gun. I can help.

286
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,371
Stay here and shut up.

287
00:24:23,682 --> 00:24:25,821
Let's get Sark. We might still be able to cut her off.

288
00:24:58,219 --> 00:24:59,020
What is it?

289
00:24:59,113 --> 00:25:00,727
There's an explosive device in your neck.

290
00:25:00,819 --> 00:25:02,098
Wait, how do you know that?

291
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,233
There's no time for painkillers. Hold him down.

292
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,024
Don't move.

293
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:08,832
Please --

294
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,766
Oh, God.

295
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,899
Syd, we have to blow the tracking device.

296
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:16,889
Vaughn, wait a second.

297
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:17,764
No, it's our backup protocol.

298
00:25:17,857 --> 00:25:19,565
No, no, no, wait. He might lead us to Anna.

299
00:25:19,704 --> 00:25:20,602
No, he's out of our custody.

300
00:25:20,675 --> 00:25:22,717
We  can't take that chance. We have to blow it now.

301
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:29,701
What happened?

302
00:25:30,354 --> 00:25:31,012
It failed.

303
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,897
Anna Aspinosa.

304
00:25:36,456 --> 00:25:38,405
Julian Sark.

305
00:25:39,712 --> 00:25:41,326
It's nice to meet you.

306
00:25:47,868 --> 00:25:49,291
We played right into her hands.

307
00:25:49,384 --> 00:25:50,759
Anna killed San'ko in front of our eyes

308
00:25:50,852 --> 00:25:52,733
and then distracted us long enough to grab Sark.

309
00:25:52,826 --> 00:25:53,915
You couldn't have predicted this.

310
00:25:54,007 --> 00:25:57,244
We had no intelligence indicating the two shared a history or an agenda.

311
00:25:57,337 --> 00:25:59,332
Still, I should have considered it s a possibility.

312
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,508
We need to focus on where Anna and Sark are headed with the bomb.

313
00:26:02,647 --> 00:26:05,053
Contact all your sources. See if anyone has heard anything.

314
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,139
I'll check back on the hour.

315
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:06,842
Good.

316
00:26:12,357 --> 00:26:14,496
A.P.O. is monitoring traffic.

317
00:26:14,682 --> 00:26:16,486
We've called in every favor we can

318
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:19,291
to get Sark and Anna on different intelligence radars.

319
00:26:19,897 --> 00:26:21,654
Considering the destructive capacity

320
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,408
of the bomb they have in their possession,

321
00:26:23,547 --> 00:26:26,449
they're going to take extra precaution in covering their tracks.

322
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,063
At this point, we'll take anything we can get.

323
00:28:12,535 --> 00:28:13,383
Not hungry?

324
00:28:14,551 --> 00:28:19,696
I thought after a year in a maximum security prison that

325
00:28:19,882 --> 00:28:23,597
you would appreciate a decent meal.

326
00:28:25,464 --> 00:28:28,510
Beware a summit that begins with shared bread.

327
00:28:28,603 --> 00:28:32,125
The sated man is at his weakest.

328
00:28:32,592 --> 00:28:34,014
Who said that?

329
00:28:34,154 --> 00:28:37,150
A vietnamese general I had dinner with once.

330
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:40,522
By dessert, I had put a bullet between his eyes.

331
00:28:54,313 --> 00:28:56,068
I appreciate the rescue.

332
00:28:57,377 --> 00:28:59,418
I assume there's a price.

333
00:28:59,744 --> 00:29:02,693
When I heard of a young man

334
00:29:03,515 --> 00:29:09,043
so ruthless in his shifting allegiances that he killed his own father,

335
00:29:09,603 --> 00:29:13,411
I thought, this is a man I am fated to work with.

336
00:29:18,085 --> 00:29:21,272
My aim tonight was Ushek San'ko's head.

337
00:29:21,365 --> 00:29:25,318
CRF is a weak organization.

338
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,498
No vision.

339
00:29:26,824 --> 00:29:29,964
Considering the power of the bomb I stole for them,

340
00:29:30,011 --> 00:29:31,671
they did not pay me nearly enough.

341
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:35,503
So you decided to go into business for yourself.

342
00:29:35,596 --> 00:29:37,447
I thought it an appropriate time.

343
00:29:38,848 --> 00:29:40,700
And then I spotted you in the club.

344
00:29:40,794 --> 00:29:42,216
And you saw your opportunity.

345
00:29:42,308 --> 00:29:43,301
Yes.

346
00:29:48,115 --> 00:29:49,250
Partnership.

347
00:29:51,026 --> 00:29:53,355
My brains, your skills.

348
00:29:53,447 --> 00:29:56,253
You flatter yourself, but something like that.

349
00:29:57,281 --> 00:29:58,608
I must tell you,

350
00:29:58,747 --> 00:30:01,600
selling a bomb on the black market can be tricky.

351
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,772
I already have a buyer in mind

352
00:30:04,912 --> 00:30:06,908
right here in this very city.

353
00:30:07,233 --> 00:30:08,799
Michel Guinot.

354
00:30:08,893 --> 00:30:11,986
A man with whom I have an excellent credit rating.

355
00:30:12,219 --> 00:30:15,311
Yes, Mr. Sark. I know you do.

356
00:30:28,866 --> 00:30:31,625
Anna's selling the bomb to a man named Michel Guinot.

357
00:30:31,766 --> 00:30:34,714
Gateway of all arms sales in and out of central Russia.

358
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:36,734
Guinot's on the watch list. We have satellite surveillance.

359
00:30:36,873 --> 00:30:38,343
Where'd the intel come from?

360
00:30:38,745 --> 00:30:40,596
Classified, but reliable.

361
00:30:40,735 --> 00:30:43,159
Your mission is to intercept the bomb, detain the principals.

362
00:30:43,252 --> 00:30:45,773
Do we have a confirmed location for the meet with Anna and Sark?

363
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:47,793
Guinot's on the move to a property he owns --

364
00:30:47,885 --> 00:30:49,546
a graveyard. He's been known to hold meets there.

365
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,727
Marshall's sending coordinates.

366
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,749
If this exchange goes through, Sydney,

367
00:30:52,842 --> 00:30:54,311
both Anna and Sark will be in the wind.

368
00:30:54,451 --> 00:30:57,495
We may never have this opportunity again.

369
00:31:02,081 --> 00:31:05,069
We called as soon as there was any change.

370
00:31:08,295 --> 00:31:10,481
- When did she wake up?
- A few minutes ago.

371
00:31:10,573 --> 00:31:12,330
But she's fine. Out of the woods.

372
00:31:16,022 --> 00:31:16,870
Thank you.

373
00:31:17,337 --> 00:31:19,809
There was an irregularity we thought you should see.

374
00:31:19,949 --> 00:31:23,709
Deloxin is a drug we use to wean patients out of medically induced comas.

375
00:31:24,063 --> 00:31:27,012
Your daughter had four times the amount we normally use.

376
00:31:27,993 --> 00:31:30,465
Mr. Sloane, Nadia didn't just wake up.

377
00:31:31,211 --> 00:31:35,164
Someone did this to her, and I believe I know who it is.

378
00:32:06,515 --> 00:32:08,516
About 14 hours.

379
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:12,323
Miss Espinosa was kind enough to set me free.

380
00:32:15,688 --> 00:32:17,806
She came here with me, didn't she?

381
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:19,839
Mademoiselle Espinosa,

382
00:32:21,053 --> 00:32:23,525
as the buyer, I dictate certain terms,

383
00:32:23,664 --> 00:32:26,183
starting with good faith on your part.

384
00:32:26,512 --> 00:32:29,317
Put your weapon on the stone, please.

385
00:32:42,829 --> 00:32:43,820
It's very nice.

386
00:32:45,409 --> 00:32:46,114
Let's go.

387
00:32:51,538 --> 00:32:55,185
Is the device acceptable to you, monsieur Guinot?

388
00:32:55,277 --> 00:32:56,414
It is.

389
00:32:56,974 --> 00:33:00,543
And the price -- is that acceptable also?

390
00:33:13,211 --> 00:33:15,111
Give me 10 seconds.

391
00:33:18,008 --> 00:33:19,859
The transfer is almost complete.

392
00:33:24,766 --> 00:33:25,236
Go.

393
00:33:35,195 --> 00:33:36,807
You get Sark. I'll go after the bomb.

394
00:34:20,148 --> 00:34:21,284
What are you doing?!

395
00:34:22,546 --> 00:34:23,632
Sydney!

396
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:26,129
I'm a man of my word.

397
00:34:27,905 --> 00:34:29,757
I will kill you.

398
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:30,936
You bastard!

399
00:35:22,158 --> 00:35:26,302
The United States government has some questions for you.

400
00:35:54,822 --> 00:35:55,862
We caught her.

401
00:35:58,245 --> 00:35:58,951
Yes, we did.

402
00:36:02,644 --> 00:36:03,587
Sark.

403
00:36:04,007 --> 00:36:05,239
We'll get him back.

404
00:36:13,508 --> 00:36:20,500
Now most people attribute the words "abra cadabra" to Houdini.

405
00:36:20,594 --> 00:36:22,589
That's not actually the case. What --

406
00:36:23,054 --> 00:36:25,767
Whoa. Okay.

407
00:36:26,141 --> 00:36:29,711
Okay. That was not supposed to happen.

408
00:36:30,692 --> 00:36:33,164
You know what? Keep 'em.

409
00:36:34,613 --> 00:36:35,701
Can I come in?

410
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,502
Hey. Yeah. Sure.

411
00:36:38,604 --> 00:36:41,935
I'll be out in the hallway entertaining sick people if you need me.

412
00:36:42,449 --> 00:36:43,156
Hey.

413
00:36:50,682 --> 00:36:51,847
Cómo estas?

414
00:36:51,985 --> 00:36:52,929
I'm good.

415
00:36:54,706 --> 00:36:56,320
- You?
- Better.

416
00:36:58,889 --> 00:37:02,222
- So you got her?
- Mm-hmm.

417
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,188
And the bomb?

418
00:37:05,374 --> 00:37:07,350
Yeah, we got that, too.

419
00:37:11,511 --> 00:37:14,604
And, hey, we didn't kill each other.

420
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:16,691
Nope.

421
00:37:32,122 --> 00:37:34,594
My closing report as acting director.

422
00:37:35,155 --> 00:37:36,721
The job's yours again.

423
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:39,502
Nadia is out of her coma.

424
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,754
Thank god she pulled through.

425
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:45,680
God had nothing to do with it.

426
00:37:46,614 --> 00:37:49,039
Her medical chart indicates that someone injected her

427
00:37:49,177 --> 00:37:51,650
with a counter agent in order to wake her up.

428
00:37:53,612 --> 00:37:54,844
As a professional courtesy,

429
00:37:54,937 --> 00:37:56,980
I would like you to justify your decision.

430
00:38:02,731 --> 00:38:06,635
Your words -- do whatever it takes to stop Anna.

431
00:38:06,915 --> 00:38:08,193
We stopped Anna.

432
00:38:08,472 --> 00:38:11,184
You also indicated that this wasn't Nadia's time,

433
00:38:11,325 --> 00:38:12,680
that she would pull through.

434
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,322
Don't tell me you're losing your faith.

435
00:38:18,732 --> 00:38:21,874
When I stepped down as director of this task force,

436
00:38:22,013 --> 00:38:24,057
you had full discretion.

437
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:29,277
I'm not going to argue with your choice because the mission was a success.

438
00:38:29,603 --> 00:38:31,980
But I would have appreciated as a father

439
00:38:32,073 --> 00:38:37,554
to be apprised of your decision to put my daughter's life at risk.

440
00:38:37,647 --> 00:38:40,549
As you do mine every day.

441
00:38:41,437 --> 00:38:44,292
When I accepted this position, I made two agreements --

442
00:38:44,384 --> 00:38:46,474
one with Langley and one with you.

443
00:38:46,567 --> 00:38:47,846
A pact.

444
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:50,122
That's still in effect.

445
00:38:51,148 --> 00:38:53,907
But only because my daughter is unhurt.

446
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,938
I wonder, Jack,

447
00:38:57,012 --> 00:39:02,158
what assurances I have that you will continue to honor it.

448
00:39:16,012 --> 00:39:18,858
