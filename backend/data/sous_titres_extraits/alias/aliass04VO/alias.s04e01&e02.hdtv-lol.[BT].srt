1
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,083
Is this okay for me ?

2
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,501
I just got it.

3
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:45,629
For you? Yes.

4
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,091
For you it's very... okay.

5
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,806
For me, too.

6
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,226
I am sorry for barging in to you.

7
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,232
Is no problem.

8
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:08,151
Do you travel much ?

9
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,280
Yes. For my work.

10
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:13,657
I like the train.

11
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,400
Yes.

12
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:17,740
What is your work ?

13
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,120
I'm in chemical business.

14
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:22,958
I knew something like that.

15
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,251
- You did ?
- Yes.

16
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,463
Because I look at your hands when I come in and I think,

17
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:32,551
he uses brain more than hands.

18
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:36,597
I use hands also.

19
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:39,433
I am hoping so.

20
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,652
So what is in case ? Chemical ?

21
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:52,738
- Chemical, yes.
- No.

22
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,991
Yes. Something danger.

23
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,118
- In this, danger ?
- Yes, in case.

24
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,245
- I don't believe.
- Yes, it's true.

25
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,206
Show me. I want to see.

26
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:04,124
I want to see what you do.

27
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,835
What is so danger ?

28
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:33,028
What is inside can be used for good or evil.

29
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,657
Me too.

30
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:39,660
Open it.

31
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:43,121
I want to see everything.

32
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,059
Is isotope.

33
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,520
Unstable, yes.

34
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:13,777
What is ... ?

35
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,550
Up here! Turn up here!

36
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,426
- What? The next street ?
- Yes! Left!

37
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,234
The alley !

38
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:27,823
Ah, it's locked! It's locked!

39
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:53,599
All right.

40
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,476
All right, at the very least, I deserve answers.

41
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,729
- We were compromised, Brodien.
- I figured that part out.

42
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,022
We were supposed to meet at 10:15.

43
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,149
- Extracted by 10:25.
- I was late.

44
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:04,902
-Yeah, and I want to know why.

-Watch the door, please.

45
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,030
There's a reason for protocol, you know that ? Where were you?

46
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,281
Can we save the debrief for the flight back ?

47
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:10,699
Didn't you try to contact agent Strum ?

48
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:11,867
I told you, his life is at risk.

49
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,744
But he's in deep cover, agent Bristow.

50
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,370
That's part of the job description.

51
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:15,996
Safety's on.

52
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:17,915
Mountaineer to Shopkeeper, please respond.

53
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,251
I need to use the bathroom.

54
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,212
Then find another one, I'm busy.

55
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,880
Mountaineer, this is Shopkeeper.

56
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,924
Shopkeeper, your cover's been blown.

57
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:29,176
We'll meet in the Ming Hai train yard -- 20 minutes.

58
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,093
Wait a second.

59
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,514
Wait. Wait, what are you -- how did you find me ?

60
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:34,515
How did you find me ?

61
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:35,432
Shopkeeper, do you copy ?

62
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,310
They know where I am! They found me! They found me!

63
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,394
What's happening ?

64
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,692
Hello, Sydney Bristow.

65
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:48,737
I heard about what you're wearing. I like it.

66
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:51,365
But your work here in Shanghai -- not so good.

67
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:55,661
You broke radio silence. Sloppy. Disappointing.

68
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,829
Who is this ? What do you want ?

69
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,331
I just got what I wanted.

70
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:02,125
We're trackingyour radio signal right now.

71
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,877
We know the building you're in. We're coming.

72
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,087
They just tracked your broadcast ?

73
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,593
- What are you doing ?
- Trust me.

74
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,846
No, I'm not just following you blind anymore. What's your plan ?

75
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,515
I don't have time to type an itinerary. You do what I say, or you'll die.

76
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,267
Now take off your shirt.

77
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:20,602
That window's too small to climb out.

78
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:21,895
I'm not climbing out.

79
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:25,315
Close your eyes.

80
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:26,525
- What the hell for ?
- Close them.

81
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,653
- Ow! That burns!
- Better than a bullet.

82
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:31,613
- Oh, my god!
- Open.

83
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:33,740
Ah, god!

84
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,325
This part's gonna hurt more.

85
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:37,452
- No. No, I don't need that.
- It's the details that matter.

86
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,079
Try not to scream.

87
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,624
I'm almost done.

88
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,175
All right, what is that for ?

89
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,217
They'll be looking for two of us,

90
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:53,635
so we're both gonna walk out of here alone.

91
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:54,761
They're gonna kill me, aren't they ?

92
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,805
They might. You've got to strut out of this club.

93
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,224
- I don't strut.
- Look at yoursel

94
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:02,102
My ear hurts.

95
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:04,646
We'll meet at the Ding Ha station. You won't need this.

96
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,232
What are you gonna do ? They know what you look like.

97
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,567
Come on already.

98
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,364
How badly do you have to go ?

99
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,536
In your complaint against agent Bristow,

100
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:03,121
you  stated that your pursuers tracked you to the restroom ?

101
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:04,581
Yes, ma'am, they did. When --

102
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:08,043
When I made contact with agent Strum. I wanted to help him.

103
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,214
I made arrangements with agent Strum to meet him at the closest LZ in Jing An.

104
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:14,466
My intention was to extract him.

105
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,426
That wasn't your purpose in Shanghai.

106
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:18,136
You were sent with one objective --

107
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,180
pick up surveillance photos from agent Brodien --

108
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:23,809
Yes, ma'am. Photos taken by agent Strum, whose cover had already been blown.

109
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:24,810
That's presupposition.

110
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,020
A  tip from an unauthenticated source,

111
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,231
and you opted to change the objective of the --

112
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:30,232
I made a judgment call.

113
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:33,068
You do understand that things don't always go as expected when you're in the field.

114
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:35,821
I don't need a lecture from you. I've read your report.

115
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:39,408
Even for you, agent Bristow, your arrogance today is appalling.

116
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,829
It wasn't meant to be a lecture, director chase, just a reminder.

117
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:49,543
With all due respect, it's been 12 years since you've been field-rated.

118
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:57,718
Your poor judgment apparently cost a man his life.

119
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:05,017
So, after dressing him up, you violated protocol yet again

120
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:06,977
by leaving your contact alone.

121
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:11,106
Mr. Brodien would have been killed otherwise.

122
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:13,275
Miss Bristow, your record's a mess.

123
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:15,777
Your consistent disregard for protocol

124
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,739
obviously speaks to some larger systemic dysfunction.

125
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,408
A psychological need to challenge authority.

126
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:24,536
If the shanghai incident were an isolated one,

127
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,496
then perhaps a warning would suffice here.

128
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,374
But this is hardly the first time you've exhibited rogue behavior.

129
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,835
What happened in Shanghai was not rogue. I was trying --

130
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,712
Miss Bristow, it's my turn to talk.

131
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:37,508
I'm recommending to the board that you be stripped of classified clearance

132
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:40,469
and assigned to the dispatch office at Langley.

133
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:44,681
You're transferring me to the mailroom ?

134
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:47,351
You'll report to officer Hermalin 8:00 A.M. On monday.

135
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,646
Let me get this straight. Is this a permanent reassignment ?

136
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:52,648
Technically, that's what a demotion is.

137
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,026
I don't know exactly what you have against me, but my record has always been --

138
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:57,861
I resent you, and I'll tell you why.

139
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:01,073
It's conduct like yours that endangers the CIA.

140
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,409
It weakens us. It forces us to take a defensive posture.

141
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:07,329
Wait a minute. Am I supposed to defend my record ?

142
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:09,498
This is not a dialogue, miss Bristow.

143
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:12,417
In Virginia monday morning.

144
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,090
If this is your decision, director Chase,

145
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,800
I will no longer burden this agency with the hazard of my participation.

146
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,050
Are you opting to terminate your association with the CIA ?

147
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:29,393
I will say it in English for you.

148
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:32,729
I quit.

149
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:54,585
Yo !

150
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:56,837
Vaughn.

151
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,505
Vaughn ! Bag's dead, man. You can give it up.

152
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:02,384
Thanks for coming.

153
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:04,469
Thanks for sweating.

154
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:06,513
You all right?

155
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,725
Yeah, I think that a full month of psych evaluation's more than enough.

156
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,310
Really? For you?

157
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:12,853
I don't know.

158
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:15,939
It was a little overkill, though.

159
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:18,525
Come on. Burning your house down?

160
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:19,818
It wasn't a happy home.

161
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:21,236
Yeah, still -- fire.

162
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:25,157
Yeah, well, you kill your wife after learning she's a vicious homicidal double agent.

163
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:26,366
See how rational you are.

164
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:31,205
I want you to know that I'm there for you, whatever you need.

165
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:35,542
You know, if you need to stay with me for a while 'cause your house is...

166
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:37,294
ashes.

167
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:38,962
I'm leaving.

168
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,339
Leaving what?

169
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:42,508
The agency?

170
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:44,551
Is this because of Sydney?

171
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:47,262
It's not because of Sydney. It's because last year sucked.

172
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,557
It's because I don't have the desire to do..

173
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:53,644
not the desire, the need to do this job anymore. I don't have it in me.

174
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:57,022
So you're telling me that this stupid idea was all on your own ?

175
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:58,774
Sydney didn't talk to you about this?

176
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:00,651
I haven't spoken to her this week. Or last. I don't know what's going on --

177
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:01,735
You got to talk to her.

178
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:02,778
Well, I've already made my decision.

179
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:05,405
Okay, this isn't about you.

180
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:08,033
Her review was today.

181
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:09,993
Sydney quit.

182
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,350
- Glad you found us.
- Me too.

183
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:39,852
That wouldn't have been a very good start.

184
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:42,187
You did well with the committee. Very convincing.

185
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:45,357
Thank you. So you were you. I actually felt like I was in trouble.

186
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:47,276
Well, I can pull it out when I need to.

187
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,111
Come on, let me show you around.

188
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:50,571
How is that man's ear?

189
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,614
Don't worry about Brodien. He thinks he's a hero.

190
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:55,367
He has no clue Shanghai was a charade.

191
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:59,830
The agency's pacific rim surveillance worked out of this office until '98.

192
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:04,042
This place was dark until two months ago when Langley approved the division.

193
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:07,462
Miss Chase, I can't tell you what an honor it is

194
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:09,756
to have been asked to be part of this operation.

195
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:13,552
I know you spoke of being hungry, looking for a fresh start..

196
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:14,511
That was nothing.

197
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,848
My father, Vaughn -- irrelevant personal stuff.

198
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,975
I want to serve my country the best I can.

199
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:22,436
Well, this assignment will be a challenge for you

200
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,229
more  than you were led to believe.

201
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,420
The four of you were chosen.

202
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:50,756
Handpicked to help run this team.

203
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:53,842
The four of us ?

204
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:57,262
Handpicked by whom ?

205
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:04,937
This is exciting.

206
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:11,235
Could I have a word, please?

207
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:20,285
When I was approached about joining a black ops unit within the CIA,

208
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:22,162
I thought I was doing the right thing.

209
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:25,832
And while I appreciate the necessary protocol in assembling a new team,

210
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:26,917
Arvin Sloane is not ..

211
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,418
I understand you used to work for Sloane.

212
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:31,129
Yeah, a criminal psychopath beyond verbal description.

213
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,339
I know all about Sloane.

214
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:35,509
Then allow me to ask the most obvious question in the history of time.

215
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:38,345
How can the CIA let that man,

216
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,848
who ran what amounts to a terrorist cell

217
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,850
within the borders of this country, run anything ?

218
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,727
You don't need me to explain the geopolitical landscape,

219
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:49,231
or to list this country's former enemies with whom we now collaborate.

220
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:50,482
You have to draw the line somewhere.

221
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:51,984
We can use him now,

222
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:54,236
his contacts, his expertise.

223
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:56,572
And he will be closely monitored.

224
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:58,490
Pity the man with that job.

225
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:05,163
Wait a minute.

226
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:07,708
With you here, Vaughn, Dixon, and your father,

227
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:09,960
there's a built-in system of checks and balances.

228
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,380
If Sloane missteps, you'll catch him.

229
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:16,675
Now that's it.

230
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:18,343
This is your assignment.

231
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:11,271
I was just explaining how the CIA approached me.

232
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:24,535
Concerned that increased public scrutiny

233
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:27,079
of the agency and the resulting red tape

234
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,165
has impeded their ability to do their job,

235
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,418
what they asked me to set up for them is a covert unit,

236
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:36,588
one that is still governed by U.S. Laws

237
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:39,591
but unhampered by bureaucratic chain of command,

238
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:42,386
with no accountability

239
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:44,179
except to ourselves.

240
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:45,889
That part was made clear.

241
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:48,642
But the part that wasn't made clear,

242
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:51,520
that's me.

243
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:53,730
No, it wasn't.

244
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:57,693
Well, quite frankly, I was surprised by their call, too,

245
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,279
until I understood what it is they want.

246
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:02,447
Their own SD-6

247
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:04,908
A unit that officially doesn't exist,

248
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:09,997
comprised of team members who have no apparent affiliation to the CIA.

249
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,332
They don't want to know how we do our day's work,

250
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:13,667
only that it gets done.

251
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:15,586
And what is our day's work?

252
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,754
His name is Yuri Kamarov.

253
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,048
He's Russia's leading nuclear scientist,

254
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:24,595
until last month when he disappeared with the only viable sample of orine-12,

255
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:27,139
a deadly and highly unstable isotope.

256
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:30,475
Signal intercepts indicate that on thursday

257
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:34,229
Kamarov will have a meeting on the train traveling between Belarus and Latvia.

258
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:36,565
We can assume he will be selling the isotope.

259
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:40,360
The CIA is unable to use that information, which is why we're here.

260
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:43,363
Sydney, Vaughn, you will beon that train.

261
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:44,615
I can't believe this.

262
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:47,910
I beg your pardon ?

263
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:49,453
Nothing.

264
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:51,788
- The buyer, who is it?
- We don't know yet.

265
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:56,627
But according to his grocery list, we can assume he's a serious threat.

266
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:59,129
We were able to intercept the protocol of the meet.

267
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:02,883
The buyer will be in the dining car at 8:00 P.M. Greenwich mean time.

268
00:23:03,342 --> 00:23:06,178
There will be a green fountain pen on the table.

269
00:23:06,512 --> 00:23:08,972
He will ask Kamarov if he would like some tea.

270
00:23:09,515 --> 00:23:13,435
Kamarov will reply that he prefers Bourbon.

271
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:15,896
Dixon, you will be on point.

272
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:20,692
Sydney, you will recover Kamarov and the isotope.

273
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:23,570
Vaughn, you will I.D. the buyer.

274
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:27,366
You will sell him a bogus isotope outfitted with a tracking device

275
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:31,203
so that Langley can follow him back to his base of operations

276
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:32,287
and grab him there.

277
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:33,205
Is that it ?

278
00:23:33,664 --> 00:23:38,001
Kamarov is known to rig his transport devices with self-destruct

279
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,586
Yes, that's correct,

280
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:41,880
so, Sydney, you'll need to get him to open the case for you.

281
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:43,799
Do you have any suggestions?

282
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:46,176
I assume you'll come up with something interesting.

283
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:50,597
Jack, you'll set up the operational plan for wheels up, 0600 hours.

284
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:53,016
Are there any questions ?

285
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,560
Besides how'd you get this job?

286
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:55,894
Sydney.

287
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:57,187
Syd.

288
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:03,235
What is this, A.P.O.?

289
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,738
It's the name of our new organization.

290
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:08,615
It's right on the door.

291
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:12,578
Authorized Personnel Only.

292
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:14,663
I thought it was fitting.

293
00:24:15,414 --> 00:24:17,124
Excuse me. I have to prep

294
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:41,565
If I'd known Sloane was involved, not a chance.

295
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,025
It was a little deceitful, right ?

296
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:45,068
Yeah, but then I thought if I refused the job,

297
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:46,361
I can't watch over Sloane.

298
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:48,030
I'm having the same conversation with myself.

299
00:24:48,614 --> 00:24:51,408
You know, I told Langley that I wanted to step down as director.

300
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,746
That  life, that suit was never for me. I belong in the field.

301
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:57,581
And then the offer came from Chase.

302
00:24:57,623 --> 00:24:59,291
"An elite black ops unit" speech.

303
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:01,251
Yeah, that's the one, and I was in.

304
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:10,844
Look, I understand your reluctance to work with me, given..

305
00:25:12,221 --> 00:25:13,222
well, given everything.

306
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:16,808
But despite my former allegiance,

307
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,019
my betrayal of you,

308
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:20,812
of this country,

309
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:22,940
you can't deny it.

310
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:25,359
We were a great team.

311
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:28,862
So I'll do this just once,

312
00:25:30,072 --> 00:25:30,989
and ask you to please

313
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,117
give me a chance.

314
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:46,380
One thing makes up for all this.

315
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:50,342
Having you as my partner again.

316
00:26:33,886 --> 00:26:35,053
- Sorry to drop by.
- It's okay.

317
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:37,556
I miss you.

318
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:40,142
I wanted to say that I miss you.

319
00:26:42,227 --> 00:26:43,270
I've been thinking,

320
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:47,691
- obviously, about what .. 
- What, you were afraid to ..

321
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:50,110
- I'm not afraid, but I .. 
- You didn't return my calls.

322
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,196
That's 'cause I could feel what was happening.

323
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:57,868
Can I come in ?

324
00:26:59,077 --> 00:27:01,079
If you come in, we both know what's going to happen.

325
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:03,123
I don't want that.

326
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:07,461
To jump right back in where we were before everything,

327
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:10,839
to pretend like those years didn't happen.

328
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:12,925
Well, that would be nice, wouldn't it?

329
00:27:15,594 --> 00:27:16,386
But they did.

330
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:20,724
We need to take it slow, Vaughn.

331
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:24,728
Yeah. You're probably right.

332
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:45,415
- You ready ?
- Ja, I think so. You ?

333
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:03,892
Excuse me !

334
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:05,978
Hello !

335
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:07,229
This is a private compartiment.

336
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:09,231
This is my room.

337
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:10,190
This isn't your room.

338
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:21,034
- Are you speaking English ?
- Yes, I speak.

339
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:23,579
See for me, this room ?

340
00:29:03,452 --> 00:29:04,328
Care for some tea ?

341
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:07,289
No, I prefer Bourbon.

342
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,004
You're early.

343
00:29:15,172 --> 00:29:16,715
I am eager to make exchange.

344
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:19,218
As am I, mr. Kamarov.

345
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:21,678
I..I am sorry.

346
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:23,847
- Ticket is good, no ?
- Yes, it's good.

347
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:32,606
I was drink... in dining car...

348
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:35,275
- too much.
- Oh. Yeah.

349
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:39,488
I am for sleeping now.

350
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:46,286
Is there a place for changing ?

351
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:49,414
Uh, yes.

352
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:51,333
Bathroom.

353
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:53,836
Thank you.

354
00:29:59,675 --> 00:30:00,759
You are cute.

355
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:06,932
I like these framings.

356
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:26,243
You want to do this in public ?

357
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,912
Mr. Vadik is not afraid of the public,

358
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:31,290
and neither am I.

359
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:14,708
Is this okay for me ? I just got it.

360
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:18,170
For you ? Yes.

361
00:31:18,921 --> 00:31:21,590
For you it's very... okay.

362
00:31:24,343 --> 00:31:27,054
You can't test power with toy from hardware store.

363
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,270
When the more comprehensive tests are done,

364
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:38,106
Mr. Vadik will forward you the other half of your payment.

365
00:31:41,944 --> 00:31:43,070
You're not very discreet.

366
00:31:44,363 --> 00:31:45,739
Terror happens every day.

367
00:31:46,198 --> 00:31:47,199
Around everyone.

368
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:51,203
And no one notices a thing until something detonates.

369
00:31:54,164 --> 00:31:56,041
Mr. Vadik and I rely on that.

370
00:32:07,052 --> 00:32:08,011
What is your work ?

371
00:32:09,346 --> 00:32:10,931
I'm in chemical business.

372
00:32:11,223 --> 00:32:12,850
I knew something like that.

373
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,017
- You did?
- Yes.

374
00:32:14,852 --> 00:32:18,438
Because I look at your hands when I come in and I think,

375
00:32:19,314 --> 00:32:22,025
he uses brain more than hands.

376
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:32,327
You look familiar.

377
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:37,249
Sometimes people tell me I look like hockey player -- Alexei Kovalev.

378
00:32:40,878 --> 00:32:41,753
No.

379
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:45,757
That's not it.

380
00:32:56,768 --> 00:32:58,478
Ah, perhaps we have met before.

381
00:32:58,854 --> 00:33:01,523
Maybe your boss, Mr. Vadik. Maybe I know him.

382
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:21,293
What is this ?

383
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:22,753
I don't know where you're from,

384
00:33:23,212 --> 00:33:24,421
but you're not Kamarov.

385
00:33:24,713 --> 00:33:26,006
Excuse me ? This is me.

386
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,010
I'm getting off the train a little early.

387
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:36,225
Find out who he is.

388
00:33:56,453 --> 00:33:59,248
Syd, they're on to us. Get out of there. There's one coming your way. Move !

389
00:34:00,082 --> 00:34:00,832
What is it ?

390
00:34:03,961 --> 00:34:04,628
Get up.

391
00:34:22,354 --> 00:34:23,105
Here.

392
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:16,325
Are you kidding ?!

393
00:37:35,631 --> 00:37:39,927
Syd, before we left, Jack came to see me with a message for you.

394
00:37:42,763 --> 00:37:44,223
Your father wanted me to remind you that in

395
00:37:44,598 --> 00:37:46,767
Belarus we're not gonna have a tactical team.

396
00:37:49,937 --> 00:37:52,773
So why is your father talking to you through me ?

397
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,031
When I was in D.C.,

398
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:04,993
I know that you went to Wittenberg, and I know your father was there.

399
00:38:08,413 --> 00:38:09,540
What happened in Wittenberg?

400
00:38:51,832 --> 00:38:52,666
Sydney.

401
00:38:58,088 --> 00:38:59,840
You were never supposed to have found this.

402
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:06,388
You want to tell me what happened in Wittenberg ?

403
00:39:12,686 --> 00:39:14,021
No, actually, I don't.

404
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:28,952
We now know the men on the train were working for Roman Vadik,

405
00:39:29,453 --> 00:39:31,163
CIA's 26th most wanted.

406
00:39:31,455 --> 00:39:35,709
Vadik's résumé has him responsible for the Chunei blast in '86, Matsu in '89,

407
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:37,628
over 12,000 dead total.

408
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:39,963
Close personal contacts of mine have confirmed

409
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:42,299
Vadik's cooperation with known terrorist cells

410
00:39:42,466 --> 00:39:44,676
in planning a major attack within the next six months.

411
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:46,720
Close personal contacts ?

412
00:39:48,597 --> 00:39:51,308
- CIA wants Vadik.
- Yes, that's right.

413
00:39:51,475 --> 00:39:52,100
What's the move ?

414
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:55,687
Last year, a foreign agent working on infiltrating Vadik's operation

415
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:57,773
made particularly good progress.

416
00:39:58,273 --> 00:39:59,650
She needs to be debriefed.

417
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:02,861
I'm sending you, Sydney. I'll give you the details in my office.

418
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:04,279
Lucky me.

419
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:12,204
The agent working with Vadik's operation

420
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:15,499
was with argentine intelligence.

421
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:18,210
- Your daughter ?
- Your sister.

422
00:40:20,337 --> 00:40:24,633
If Nadia's the one with intel on Vadik, why not debrief her yourself ?

423
00:40:27,386 --> 00:40:28,178
We went searching,

424
00:40:30,681 --> 00:40:31,515
Nadia and I,

425
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:37,104
for an artifact built by Rambaldi.

426
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:39,398
Its value immeasurable.

427
00:40:41,483 --> 00:40:42,067
And we found it.

428
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:45,445
And we promptly handed it over to the U.S. government.

429
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:48,824
That's how you got this position.

430
00:40:50,826 --> 00:40:51,451
You bought it.

431
00:40:53,036 --> 00:40:56,248
It turns out the pain that she felt as a result of her job was profound,

432
00:40:57,499 --> 00:40:59,042
something with which you're familiar.

433
00:40:59,918 --> 00:41:00,377
You think ?

434
00:41:01,295 --> 00:41:04,548
I tried to convince her to stay, to transfer over to the CIA.

435
00:41:05,549 --> 00:41:07,426
I knew she would be of great value here.

436
00:41:09,303 --> 00:41:11,471
But she chose to leave intelligence,

437
00:41:12,556 --> 00:41:13,098
to drop out.

438
00:41:15,017 --> 00:41:16,185
You're sure she really left ?

439
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:18,562
Fake quitting seems to be all the rage.

440
00:41:18,937 --> 00:41:21,356
She's out. She's back in Argentina.

441
00:41:22,566 --> 00:41:24,985
She wants nothing to do with me or this life.

442
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,197
You're awfully glib, Sydney.

443
00:41:29,656 --> 00:41:31,491
Nadia left you on bad terms.

444
00:41:35,204 --> 00:41:40,792
I suppose I have something to learn about being a father.

445
00:41:43,504 --> 00:41:45,172
I can see why you don't want to go.

446
00:41:46,423 --> 00:41:47,925
That wasn't meant to be glib.

447
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:53,597
I still don't know why you think she'll talk to me.

448
00:41:54,348 --> 00:41:56,558
Because I see in her something I once saw in you,

449
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,894
the need to work for what's right.

450
00:41:59,937 --> 00:42:02,481
And because you know what it is to put aside personal issues.

451
00:42:02,606 --> 00:42:03,232
And that,

452
00:42:04,775 --> 00:42:05,609
that's a gift.

453
00:42:06,485 --> 00:42:07,528
It's not a gift.

454
00:42:08,195 --> 00:42:11,073
What it's been is a necessity, and it's become a burden,

455
00:42:12,324 --> 00:42:14,952
and quite frankly, something I have run out of patience for.

456
00:42:25,128 --> 00:42:28,507
Vaughn, before she goes, you might tell her the truth.

457
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:30,551
No, I'm not gonna be a conduit to your daughter.

458
00:42:30,634 --> 00:42:33,136
I've tried that before. You can imagine how well that went over.

459
00:42:33,345 --> 00:42:36,473
And, no, she didn't say anything, if that's what you're asking yourself.

460
00:42:36,557 --> 00:42:39,101
She hasn't said a word about anything that happened between the two of you.

461
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:42,521
Which gives me an idea of what that is.

462
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:45,357
And, Jack, I hope for Sydney's sake that I'm wrong.

463
00:43:47,711 --> 00:43:50,088
I'm guessing this isn't a personal visit.

464
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,008
No.

465
00:43:55,219 --> 00:43:56,637
Roman Vadik.

466
00:43:59,431 --> 00:44:00,474
We need your help.

467
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,312
Nadia, I need you to come back with me.

468
00:44:05,395 --> 00:44:06,063
No.

469
00:44:07,022 --> 00:44:07,856
Sydney...

470
00:44:16,365 --> 00:44:17,533
He was a good friend.

471
00:44:18,283 --> 00:44:19,243
Worked with me.

472
00:44:22,704 --> 00:44:23,956
Vadik killed him.

473
00:44:25,332 --> 00:44:26,667
Had his...

474
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:29,586
head shipped back to our office.

475
00:44:33,757 --> 00:44:36,134
But I'll give you what I have.

476
00:44:37,636 --> 00:44:41,306
No one deals with Vadik directly. Everything goes through his lieutenant.

477
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:43,100
- You want to write this down?
- No, I got it.

478
00:44:43,183 --> 00:44:44,810
Kazu Tamazaki.

479
00:44:44,977 --> 00:44:47,479
Considers himself a modern samurai.

480
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:52,651
Arrested five years ago trying to rob the Hasunaga asian museum in London.

481
00:44:52,734 --> 00:44:54,236
Escaped from police custody.

482
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:56,572
Among the least of the charges against him.

483
00:44:57,197 --> 00:44:58,407
I hope that helps.

484
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:01,577
Men like Vadik, like Tamazaki, they need to be eliminated.

485
00:45:01,702 --> 00:45:02,661
I can't.

486
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:09,334
I can't.

487
00:45:12,129 --> 00:45:13,630
You do understand?

488
00:45:14,923 --> 00:45:16,133
Yeah.

489
00:45:30,355 --> 00:45:33,108
- I made penne. There was --
- This cannot continue.

490
00:45:34,109 --> 00:45:37,571
A crucial assumption of our operational competence is communication!

491
00:45:38,197 --> 00:45:40,157
Sydney, if we don't have that,

492
00:45:40,282 --> 00:45:43,368
every mission, the life of every operative, could be at risk.

493
00:45:43,452 --> 00:45:44,203
I'm doing my job.

494
00:45:44,286 --> 00:45:46,830
No. What you need to do is find a way to accept what's happened.

495
00:45:46,955 --> 00:45:48,332
If you can deal with Arvin Sloane --

496
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:51,251
I love that you knew that, that you approved it.

497
00:45:51,502 --> 00:45:53,253
It may be hard for you to accept that your father

498
00:45:53,378 --> 00:45:55,380
doesn't have the authority to make all the decisions that --

499
00:45:55,464 --> 00:45:58,800
No, what's hard for me to accept are the decisions that you do make.

500
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:02,346
What's hard is looking at you.

501
00:46:02,596 --> 00:46:03,639
Walking past you,

502
00:46:03,722 --> 00:46:06,225
smelling that sickening cologne.

503
00:46:06,308 --> 00:46:09,102
What's hard is being your daughter

504
00:46:09,228 --> 00:46:12,523
and not being able to separate myself as far as I may get

505
00:46:12,731 --> 00:46:14,775
from the person I despise the most.

506
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:21,448
You went to see Nadia.

507
00:46:23,242 --> 00:46:25,494
Did you tell her what you know?

508
00:46:40,133 --> 00:46:41,677
I guess I thought

509
00:46:42,553 --> 00:46:44,471
that maybe you'd come here,

510
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:48,058
I don't know, to give me something, information --

511
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:52,896
something that would help make sense of what I was afraid you'd become,

512
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,690
but there's nothing you could say.

513
00:46:56,984 --> 00:46:59,778
Of course you were only looking out for yourself.

514
00:47:01,947 --> 00:47:05,075
Is that what you think of me as an operative?

515
00:47:05,617 --> 00:47:10,497
That I would reveal your secret to that poor girl?

516
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,129
I didn't tell Nadia a thing.

517
00:47:35,439 --> 00:47:36,315
Sorry.

518
00:47:48,827 --> 00:47:50,245
What's going on?

519
00:47:51,788 --> 00:47:53,498
It was Lauren who told me.

520
00:47:55,417 --> 00:47:56,084
What?

521
00:47:57,836 --> 00:47:59,129
Told me where to look.

522
00:48:01,715 --> 00:48:04,176
Safety deposit box in Wittenberg.

523
00:48:11,391 --> 00:48:12,976
How she knew, I don't know.

524
00:48:15,062 --> 00:48:18,565
I wasn't even going to go. I had no reason to believe anything that woman said.

525
00:48:22,361 --> 00:48:25,072
But the curiosity was just too strong.

526
00:48:30,911 --> 00:48:31,912
I got there.

527
00:48:32,788 --> 00:48:35,082
Inside the box, there was a file.

528
00:48:35,791 --> 00:48:36,875
Classified.

529
00:48:36,959 --> 00:48:38,085
Highest level.

530
00:48:44,925 --> 00:48:52,140
My heart was pounding, like I knew somehow before I knew.

531
00:48:54,059 --> 00:48:55,060
What was it?

532
00:48:57,938 --> 00:48:58,605
Evidence.

533
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:03,694
Evidence that my mother had been a security risk,

534
00:49:03,777 --> 00:49:05,070
which wasn't really news.

535
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:10,200
It mentioned her history with the KGB-- everything we knew.

536
00:49:15,539 --> 00:49:16,748
Then there was a page.

537
00:49:20,419 --> 00:49:22,713
An official request made by my father

538
00:49:24,715 --> 00:49:28,385
asking for the authority to execute Irina Derevko.

539
00:49:30,137 --> 00:49:32,556
A request that was granted.

540
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:36,435
And he did it.

541
00:49:41,064 --> 00:49:42,065
He killed her.

542
00:49:48,155 --> 00:49:49,448
He killed my mother.

543
00:49:55,412 --> 00:49:56,455
He did it, Vaughn.

544
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:00,083
He killed her.

545
00:50:01,084 --> 00:50:02,169
He killed my mother.

546
00:50:19,186 --> 00:50:21,188
Two weeks ago, the man on the train,

547
00:50:21,271 --> 00:50:24,149
Kazu Tamazaki, severed ties with all known contacts,

548
00:50:24,233 --> 00:50:26,068
eliminated all means of communication.

549
00:50:26,151 --> 00:50:27,569
Any idea where he's gone or why?

550
00:50:27,694 --> 00:50:30,906
Nothing. Our one link to Roman Vadik has disappeared.

551
00:50:30,948 --> 00:50:33,075
Any indication Vadik turned on Tamazaki?

552
00:50:33,158 --> 00:50:35,410
All chatter says that Vadik is status quo.

553
00:50:35,536 --> 00:50:37,204
So Tamazaki is still all we've got.

554
00:50:37,287 --> 00:50:38,664
All we had. He's gone.

555
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:40,541
Back to what we know.

556
00:50:40,582 --> 00:50:43,210
The Hasunaga asian museum in London.

557
00:50:43,585 --> 00:50:46,505
Yeah, Nadia said he was arrested five years ago-- a break-in.

558
00:50:46,588 --> 00:50:47,548
Was there a motive?

559
00:50:47,673 --> 00:50:50,592
He was caught in the Shintaro sword exhibit.

560
00:50:50,843 --> 00:50:53,595
Shootout, killed two MPs and one of his own men.

561
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:54,638
What was he doing?

562
00:50:54,763 --> 00:50:56,974
Trying to steal the Shintaro sword,

563
00:50:57,182 --> 00:51:00,352
the most famous samurai sword outside of Japan,

564
00:51:00,435 --> 00:51:03,105
wanting to restore honor to the blade and to his country.

565
00:51:03,188 --> 00:51:04,022
You got to be kidding me.

566
00:51:04,147 --> 00:51:06,066
We may not have the means to contact Tamazaki,

567
00:51:06,191 --> 00:51:10,863
but I can see a way to get Tamazaki to contact us.

568
00:51:10,946 --> 00:51:13,782
Are you suggesting we fake a robbery of the Hasunaga?

569
00:51:19,329 --> 00:51:21,623
You think we should steal the sword.

570
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:25,002
That museum's one of the world's most secure.

571
00:51:25,085 --> 00:51:26,712
If this were my operation,

572
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,631
there's only one man I'd trust to get us in there.

573
00:51:34,511 --> 00:51:35,220
Hey,

574
00:51:36,263 --> 00:51:38,182
you as depressed as I am?

575
00:51:39,057 --> 00:51:39,975
Depressed about what?

576
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:40,893
Depressed about what?

577
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:42,936
Take a look around here.

578
00:51:43,061 --> 00:51:43,979
This place is a ghost town.

579
00:51:44,146 --> 00:51:45,856
I don't even know anybody here anymore.

580
00:51:50,194 --> 00:51:51,195
Sydney's gone,

581
00:51:51,945 --> 00:51:55,115
Dixon, Jack, Vaughn.

582
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:56,533
The only guy we have left is Sark,

583
00:51:56,617 --> 00:51:57,784
and that's only because he's in custody.

584
00:51:57,868 --> 00:52:00,078
Hate that guy. I mean, really, kind of scar--

585
00:52:00,204 --> 00:52:04,625
although I did go visit him twice, just to see a familiar face.

586
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,126
We had eggs.

587
00:52:06,251 --> 00:52:07,294
Don't do that.

588
00:52:19,431 --> 00:52:22,643
Marshall Flinkman, you're under arrest for the misuse of government assets.

589
00:52:22,726 --> 00:52:24,353
Misuse? What? What did I misuse?

590
00:52:24,394 --> 00:52:27,606
Unauthorized computer equipment may be connected to the monitors you've been provided.

591
00:52:27,731 --> 00:52:29,691
Connected? I don't understand. What did I have connected?

592
00:52:30,025 --> 00:52:31,652
Is this yours?

593
00:52:33,028 --> 00:52:33,820
Uh...

594
00:52:33,987 --> 00:52:35,656
It was for a mission. I swear.

595
00:52:35,739 --> 00:52:37,616
I just wanted to download some maps from Conquer Quest.

596
00:52:37,658 --> 00:52:40,327
I heard they were really good. Of course, the CIA maps are much better --

597
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:48,085
Am I dead?

598
00:52:48,544 --> 00:52:49,795
You've been recruited.

599
00:52:50,963 --> 00:52:53,048
We're a black ops division, Marshall.

600
00:52:53,257 --> 00:52:55,092
You're going to head up technology.

601
00:52:59,763 --> 00:53:01,223
Uh, Syd...

602
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,601
Sloane is here.

603
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:06,353
We know.

604
00:53:08,605 --> 00:53:09,189
Okay.

605
00:53:11,984 --> 00:53:13,068
Syd.

606
00:53:13,777 --> 00:53:14,778
We're back.

607
00:53:33,797 --> 00:53:36,508
Merlin to team. Great. Way to go, guys.

608
00:53:36,717 --> 00:53:37,551
Stay focused.

609
00:53:38,051 --> 00:53:39,344
They're focused.

610
00:53:49,146 --> 00:53:51,690
Okay, Shotgun to Merlin. Tapping into surveillance.

611
00:54:03,744 --> 00:54:03,827


612
00:54:03,952 --> 00:54:05,454
Okay, I can see it.

613
00:54:05,537 --> 00:54:07,039
The Shintaro sword.

614
00:54:12,336 --> 00:54:15,380
It's a studler matrix system. What am I looking for?

615
00:54:16,173 --> 00:54:19,760
- Okay, studler matrix.
- What fuse?

616
00:54:20,761 --> 00:54:21,595
L7.

617
00:54:21,678 --> 00:54:23,305
Copy that. Looping l7.

618
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:24,890
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute!

619
00:54:24,973 --> 00:54:26,683
That would be bad. Don't do that.

620
00:54:27,184 --> 00:54:31,355
You need to re-route through E3.

621
00:54:33,732 --> 00:54:34,775
E3 rerouted.

622
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,068
Okay, go to L7.

623
00:54:36,193 --> 00:54:38,195
Copy that. Looping L7.

624
00:54:42,991 --> 00:54:44,451
Okay, the security feed's looped.

625
00:54:51,542 --> 00:54:54,211
Outrigger, something fell down the vent.

626
00:54:55,712 --> 00:54:56,713
Cooney to control.

627
00:54:57,589 --> 00:54:58,590
Right, Cooney.

628
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:02,261
Check floor two, would you? I think I heard something.

629
00:55:03,387 --> 00:55:05,013
No, it's all clear.

630
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:06,306
You're still good.

631
00:55:11,353 --> 00:55:12,187
Hey...

632
00:55:13,647 --> 00:55:15,023
Good luck.

633
00:55:15,566 --> 00:55:16,191
Thanks.

634
00:55:22,322 --> 00:55:23,365
How cool is this?

635
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:25,409
Stealing a sword so we can find a bad guy,

636
00:55:25,617 --> 00:55:28,036
you know, in order to catch an even bigger bad guy?

637
00:55:28,161 --> 00:55:31,164
Come on. Come on, you would never let us do this back in the CIA --

638
00:55:31,248 --> 00:55:35,085
you know, when you were double-breasted serious robot Dixon.

639
00:55:35,878 --> 00:55:36,920
I mean, not that you --

640
00:55:37,045 --> 00:55:40,174
you were just... authoritative.

641
00:55:40,465 --> 00:55:41,717
I'm sorry.

642
00:55:47,097 --> 00:55:50,100
Outrigger to base. ETA 90 seconds.

643
00:55:50,809 --> 00:55:54,229
Security cameras are on loop. So far, so good.

644
00:57:10,472 --> 00:57:11,557
The biggest challenge,

645
00:57:11,598 --> 00:57:12,724
hands down,

646
00:57:13,475 --> 00:57:15,686
is that pressure pad on the case.

647
00:57:16,812 --> 00:57:18,647
You know, the marble border.

648
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:22,109
There's no way to deactivate it. Super-calibrated.

649
00:57:40,127 --> 00:57:41,128
Phoenix, you've got company.

650
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:43,297
Tango headed your way. ETA 20 seconds.

651
00:57:45,257 --> 00:57:47,426
Phoenix, abort! Repeat, abort!

652
00:57:47,551 --> 00:57:48,719
I'm almost there.

653
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:54,516
Phoenix, he's coming. Get out of there now!

654
00:57:54,558 --> 00:57:55,559
I'm almost there.

655
00:58:32,804 --> 00:58:33,764
Damn it!

656
00:58:51,865 --> 00:58:54,493
Phoenix to base. I'm in the East alley. I need an extraction now!

657
00:58:54,576 --> 00:58:56,578
Find a secondary route. We're at 60 seconds out.

658
00:58:56,662 --> 00:58:59,456
I don't have 60 seconds. I'll meet you at the LZ. I'm going.

659
00:59:17,516 --> 00:59:18,642
Sydney, get in.

660
00:59:19,434 --> 00:59:21,436
Get in now. You can be stubborn later.

661
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:23,689
Outrigger, this is Raptor.

662
00:59:23,856 --> 00:59:25,274
I have Phoenix. Heading to rendezvous.

663
00:59:25,357 --> 00:59:26,191
What are you doing here?

664
00:59:26,233 --> 00:59:28,026
You know what else typically works in a situation like this?

665
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:30,195
A simple "thank you". Get down.

666
00:59:51,216 --> 00:59:53,510
You didn't tell her, did you? The truth?

667
00:59:55,262 --> 00:59:59,433
I told her that I was responsible for the death of her mother.

668
00:59:59,766 --> 01:00:01,393
Did you tell her everything?

669
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:04,104
She's better off not knowing everything.

670
01:00:05,814 --> 01:00:07,024
Tough call, Jack.

671
01:00:09,651 --> 01:00:11,945
Better that she detest me.

672
01:00:12,321 --> 01:00:15,866
I fear the alternative would have left her incapacitated.

673
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:27,419
I assume you have something to sell.

674
01:00:27,544 --> 01:00:29,963
I have the Shintaro sword.

675
01:00:32,925 --> 01:00:36,678
Herr Vogel, you never cease to astound me.

676
01:00:37,137 --> 01:00:39,431
An inside job, no doubt, yes?

677
01:00:40,432 --> 01:00:41,600
No matter.

678
01:00:42,351 --> 01:00:45,145
People on the streets are impressed. An incredible job.

679
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:48,190
My friends are good at what they do.

680
01:00:48,315 --> 01:00:50,734
Let me make a few calls.

681
01:00:52,528 --> 01:00:53,237
It's done.

682
01:00:53,278 --> 01:00:54,988
Good work. Head home.

683
01:00:57,032 --> 01:00:59,076
Dixon put the sword in play.

684
01:00:59,201 --> 01:01:01,662
We can expect to hear from Tamazaki within hours.

685
01:01:05,499 --> 01:01:07,209
It's good, isn't it?

686
01:01:07,876 --> 01:01:11,421
Having the team back together again. Hmm?

687
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:19,721
Anything?

688
01:01:19,847 --> 01:01:21,557
Oh, uh, hey.

689
01:01:21,974 --> 01:01:24,643
Well, mostly what we already know.

690
01:01:24,726 --> 01:01:26,854
Roman Vadik is some serious bad news.

691
01:01:27,312 --> 01:01:28,689
Check this out.

692
01:01:30,732 --> 01:01:33,151
Pakistan -- 500 casualties.

693
01:01:33,735 --> 01:01:37,197
Prime minister of Kafiristan assassinated in broad daylight.

694
01:01:39,992 --> 01:01:40,909
Who's that?

695
01:01:41,034 --> 01:01:43,453
Uh, that's Pablo Martinez. He's an argentinean agent.

696
01:01:43,579 --> 01:01:45,581
He was investigating Vadik last year.

697
01:01:45,664 --> 01:01:47,916
He was caught. Vadik had him killed.

698
01:01:48,876 --> 01:01:49,668
Yeah.

699
01:01:50,544 --> 01:01:52,713
Martinez was partners with Nadia Santos.

700
01:01:52,838 --> 01:01:54,965
- Your sister?
- Half-sister.

701
01:01:56,133 --> 01:01:59,344
Well, he was the only one who ever saw Vadik alive.

702
01:01:59,428 --> 01:02:01,346
I mean, at least on our side.

703
01:02:01,513 --> 01:02:04,308
He wasn't transmitting, was he, when he was captured?

704
01:02:14,484 --> 01:02:15,527
I'll make you a deal.

705
01:02:16,236 --> 01:02:18,280
You cooperate with us.

706
01:02:18,697 --> 01:02:19,781
That's it.

707
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:21,658
You don't frighten me.

708
01:02:21,825 --> 01:02:23,785
Then clearly you're an idiot.

709
01:02:24,703 --> 01:02:27,623
The man you were working for on the train, Tamazaki,

710
01:02:27,748 --> 01:02:30,417
he referred to his boss -- Mr. Vadik.

711
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:32,461
But we ran voice prints.

712
01:02:32,586 --> 01:02:38,842
Yeah, um, an agent was killed last year by Vadik, but his voice --

713
01:02:38,926 --> 01:02:42,554
you know, the killer -- it matches perfectly with the man on the train.

714
01:02:42,638 --> 01:02:43,597
Tamazaki.

715
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:48,560
Which means Vadik trusts Tamazaki enough to front for him, act on his behalf.

716
01:02:48,936 --> 01:02:54,525
Simple deduction says that if Tamazaki trusts you, you've seen Vadik.

717
01:03:03,492 --> 01:03:05,077
Where do we find Vadik?

718
01:03:09,122 --> 01:03:11,834
I'll need protective services for this.

719
01:03:12,668 --> 01:03:15,128
You help us, and you have my word.

720
01:03:17,047 --> 01:03:18,090
Vadik.

721
01:03:25,389 --> 01:03:26,974
You had him.

722
01:03:29,518 --> 01:03:31,854
Vadik is Tamazaki.

723
01:03:33,355 --> 01:03:35,148
There is no Vadik.

724
01:03:35,315 --> 01:03:36,650
It's a cover.

725
01:03:36,817 --> 01:03:38,235
He made him up.

726
01:03:39,027 --> 01:03:40,696
There's no Vadik.

727
01:03:43,031 --> 01:03:44,741
Vadik doesn't exist at all.

728
01:03:44,825 --> 01:03:47,202
It's actually Tamazaki who's in charge.

729
01:03:47,452 --> 01:03:49,371
We need a new gameplan.

730
01:03:50,497 --> 01:03:51,290
Yes?

731
01:03:51,415 --> 01:03:52,833
Tamazaki took the bait.

732
01:03:52,958 --> 01:03:55,586
We're set for a Wednesday meet in Rio de Janeiro.

733
01:03:55,711 --> 01:03:58,964
He insists that the woman who stole the sword make the delivery.

734
01:03:59,089 --> 01:04:01,592
Apparently he has access to police files. He was intrigued.

735
01:04:01,675 --> 01:04:02,426
What about backup?

736
01:04:02,551 --> 01:04:03,719
She's allowed one additional.

737
01:04:03,802 --> 01:04:06,054
Good. Jack, you escort Sydney with the sword.

738
01:04:06,138 --> 01:04:09,308
Vaughn, Marshall, you'll support Dixon. I want a plan by 1800.

739
01:04:09,391 --> 01:04:10,851
Excuse me.

740
01:04:11,351 --> 01:04:13,520
I'd prefer Dixon as my partner.

741
01:04:13,896 --> 01:04:16,273
I'm sure you're aware of our experience together in the field.

742
01:04:16,356 --> 01:04:18,317
That shorthand could be important.

743
01:04:18,609 --> 01:04:20,819
I've already made my assignments.

744
01:04:38,545 --> 01:04:40,214
- You good?
- Yeah.

745
01:04:40,339 --> 01:04:41,757
As soon as Tamazaki makes contact,

746
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,634
we'll I.D. and take out any backup he's got,

747
01:04:43,759 --> 01:04:45,969
then we'll move in, grab him, get on the plane.

748
01:04:51,266 --> 01:04:52,226
Team's in position. Mikes are hot.

749
01:04:52,726 --> 01:04:53,894
We've got full visual.

750
01:04:54,019 --> 01:04:55,187
Phoenix, Raptor, it's your show.

751
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:56,480
Copy that, Outrigger.

752
01:05:04,947 --> 01:05:07,658
This is the best conversation we've had in weeks.

753
01:05:17,376 --> 01:05:20,087
Merlin, patch this call through my ear piece to the rest of the team.

754
01:05:20,212 --> 01:05:23,632
Okay, Phoenix, you are hot. And I mean that in many ways.

755
01:05:23,715 --> 01:05:25,425
Shotgun, you're in on the call.

756
01:05:28,136 --> 01:05:28,804
Hello?

757
01:05:29,263 --> 01:05:32,933
Look across the square. You'll see a tunnel.

758
01:05:33,809 --> 01:05:35,978
It will take you to the belly of the Alves building.

759
01:05:36,061 --> 01:05:37,396
Go to the 10th floor.

760
01:05:37,479 --> 01:05:39,356
No backup, no guns.

761
01:05:39,439 --> 01:05:40,649
Just the sword.

762
01:05:40,774 --> 01:05:42,860
Meet me in three minutes, or it's off.

763
01:05:42,943 --> 01:05:43,944
Merlin, the Alves building.

764
01:05:44,027 --> 01:05:46,280
Now listen, this building was converted into a bank last year.

765
01:05:46,363 --> 01:05:48,198
Shotgun, you're gonna have to look the part.

766
01:05:48,365 --> 01:05:51,076
Okay, we've got wardrobe. Let's do it.

767
01:05:54,246 --> 01:05:56,957
I'm going in -- alone.

768
01:05:58,292 --> 01:06:00,919
I assume you all heard that.

769
01:06:05,507 --> 01:06:07,342
Starting through the tunnel.

770
01:06:11,388 --> 01:06:13,599
Phoenix, meet me at the elevators before you go up.

771
01:06:13,682 --> 01:06:15,058
See you at the elevator.

772
01:06:18,312 --> 01:06:21,982
Okay, now that tunnel was reinforced after the earthquake of '44.

773
01:06:22,107 --> 01:06:24,067
We're probably gonna lose comms until --

774
01:06:40,167 --> 01:06:43,545
Shotgun, we've temporarily lost contact with Phoenix.

775
01:06:50,469 --> 01:06:53,430
Merlin, tell me there's a 10th floor in this building.

776
01:06:57,601 --> 01:06:58,602
Guys...

777
01:08:15,554 --> 01:08:17,514
Hello, Sydney Bristow.

778
01:08:58,514 --> 01:09:01,850
If Tamazaki wanted to kill Sydney, we're already too late.

779
01:09:02,184 --> 01:09:05,479
The only assumption we can operate on practically is that Sydney is alive

780
01:09:05,729 --> 01:09:08,065
and Tamazaki has some need for her.

781
01:09:08,398 --> 01:09:09,399
So where is she?

782
01:09:09,483 --> 01:09:12,152
Rio was Tamazaki's call, not mine. It's his turf.

783
01:09:12,236 --> 01:09:14,196
Meaning he most likely has some sort of base here,

784
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:15,405
satellite office maybe.

785
01:09:15,572 --> 01:09:18,450
Marshall, does Tamazaki's file indicate property holdings?

786
01:09:18,742 --> 01:09:21,370
I already checked. Nothing. Nothing in Rio, nothing anywhere in Brazil.

787
01:09:21,453 --> 01:09:22,412
We know someone with intel --

788
01:09:22,496 --> 01:09:24,248
the agent who led us to Tamazaki in the first place.

789
01:09:24,331 --> 01:09:26,333
Well, my daughter has refused to cooperate.

790
01:09:26,458 --> 01:09:28,043
Still, she gave Sydney Tamazaki's name.

791
01:09:28,126 --> 01:09:30,921
If she were apprised of the situation, she might help.

792
01:09:31,004 --> 01:09:33,048
I'll make her help. Where is she?

793
01:09:36,468 --> 01:09:37,302
Hola?

794
01:09:37,386 --> 01:09:38,971
This is Michael Vaughn. I'm in Rio.

795
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,223
Sydney's in trouble.

796
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:42,307
Is it Vadik?

797
01:09:42,391 --> 01:09:44,268
Vadik and Tamazaki are the same person.

798
01:09:44,351 --> 01:09:46,478
Look, we don't know if Sydney's still alive, but if she is,

799
01:09:46,562 --> 01:09:48,021
you're her only hope.

800
01:09:51,275 --> 01:09:52,609
Nadia, please.

801
01:09:54,278 --> 01:09:59,199
Tamazaki used to run an operation near the Catedral Metropolitana.

802
01:09:59,449 --> 01:10:00,576
Okay, I'll need details.

803
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:16,758
Sydney Bristow.

804
01:10:19,553 --> 01:10:21,305
What happened to the deal?

805
01:10:22,973 --> 01:10:23,932
What?

806
01:10:26,977 --> 01:10:31,440
What happened to the deal?

807
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:44,870
Before you leave this room,

808
01:10:45,746 --> 01:10:47,331
you will tell me why.

809
01:10:47,831 --> 01:10:49,082
I might.

810
01:10:49,541 --> 01:10:51,293
I'm relatively open-minded.

811
01:10:54,671 --> 01:10:57,508
But in this case, I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

812
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:03,680
Have you eaten breakfast?

813
01:11:03,722 --> 01:11:05,432
Why? You want to grab something?

814
01:11:05,516 --> 01:11:07,267
You probably ate breakfast.

815
01:11:09,561 --> 01:11:11,021
Just in case,

816
01:11:11,897 --> 01:11:12,940
we'll wait.

817
01:12:13,041 --> 01:12:17,004
It's been three months. What happened to you?

818
01:12:17,629 --> 01:12:20,966
It took longer then I thought to find your birthday present.

819
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:53,123
I saw you standing in the park.

820
01:12:53,498 --> 01:12:56,502
I was looking for the woman who stole the Shintaro, and

821
01:12:56,627 --> 01:12:59,546
then I saw you, and I knew...

822
01:13:00,756 --> 01:13:02,966
this wasn't about the sword.

823
01:13:04,551 --> 01:13:07,179
So now you found out...

824
01:13:07,429 --> 01:13:09,223
about the hit.

825
01:13:12,392 --> 01:13:16,063
Which means you must know why you were spared,

826
01:13:16,104 --> 01:13:19,816
why the job went away.

827
01:13:44,842 --> 01:13:46,510
I told you, I don't know about any hit.

828
01:13:53,141 --> 01:13:55,519
You wouldn't be here if you didn't know about the contract.

829
01:14:00,649 --> 01:14:01,817
What contract?

830
01:14:06,113 --> 01:14:09,992
The contract I had on your life.

831
01:14:11,285 --> 01:14:13,245
You were hired to kill me?

832
01:14:13,412 --> 01:14:14,580
Who hired you?

833
01:14:16,415 --> 01:14:17,082
Sydney...

834
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:19,918
assassin/client privilege.

835
01:14:21,044 --> 01:14:23,839
The day before the job, my client was killed.

836
01:14:23,964 --> 01:14:25,716
Most unfortunate...

837
01:14:25,799 --> 01:14:26,800
for me.

838
01:14:27,634 --> 01:14:30,721
I swear to god, I don't know anything about this.

839
01:14:39,229 --> 01:14:41,064
Somehow I believe you.

840
01:14:42,524 --> 01:14:47,196
I guess this was just one of those coincidences.

841
01:14:47,362 --> 01:14:49,698
Guess I can just sell you the sword and go home.

842
01:14:51,366 --> 01:14:53,744
I'll just take the sword.

843
01:14:54,244 --> 01:14:55,454
How's that?

844
01:15:20,312 --> 01:15:22,189
So, Nadia, the tranquilizer lips --

845
01:15:22,272 --> 01:15:23,398
do you think it was too red?

846
01:15:23,565 --> 01:15:24,942
Does Jorge have the key card?

847
01:15:25,192 --> 01:15:26,193
Got it.

848
01:15:33,367 --> 01:15:34,284
I'm in.

849
01:15:49,007 --> 01:15:49,883
You'll be okay.

850
01:15:53,846 --> 01:15:54,721
Nadia.

851
01:16:04,898 --> 01:16:05,816
Sydney!

852
01:16:07,192 --> 01:16:08,151
Sydney!

853
01:16:21,415 --> 01:16:23,166
- Where's Sydney?
- She went that way.

854
01:16:58,869 --> 01:17:00,120
I was told you were good.

855
01:17:56,844 --> 01:17:58,011
Who hired you?

856
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,645
Who put a contract on my life?

857
01:18:08,772 --> 01:18:09,815
Who hired you?

858
01:18:16,738 --> 01:18:17,781
Derevko.

859
01:18:21,285 --> 01:18:23,871
Irina Derevko.

860
01:18:33,547 --> 01:18:35,215
Congratulations.

861
01:18:36,258 --> 01:18:38,302
We recovered the isotope,

862
01:18:39,052 --> 01:18:40,804
we've eliminated a dangerous enemy,

863
01:18:42,014 --> 01:18:43,849
and the british government is most grateful

864
01:18:43,974 --> 01:18:47,311
for american assistance in returning the Shintaro sword.

865
01:18:50,355 --> 01:18:52,399
I would also like to announce that

866
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:56,486
Nadia has accepted my offer to join A.P.O.

867
01:18:57,070 --> 01:19:00,908
I know that she can rely on your full support in the days and weeks ahead.

868
01:19:00,991 --> 01:19:02,075
So,

869
01:19:02,868 --> 01:19:03,994
that's it.

870
01:19:04,119 --> 01:19:05,245
Go home.

871
01:19:06,705 --> 01:19:08,665
Feel good about what you've done.

872
01:19:29,561 --> 01:19:30,562
How did you find out?

873
01:19:31,897 --> 01:19:32,648
Tamazaki.

874
01:19:33,565 --> 01:19:35,067
He had the contract.

875
01:19:44,326 --> 01:19:45,536
You didn't know?

876
01:19:47,663 --> 01:19:51,625
I merely knew your mother had hired someone. I didn't know who.

877
01:19:53,168 --> 01:19:54,837
I had only one way to stop him.

878
01:19:56,797 --> 01:19:58,632
Why would she want me dead?

879
01:20:04,763 --> 01:20:05,806
I don't know.

880
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:16,942
You killed her to save me.

881
01:20:18,068 --> 01:20:19,653
You killed mom

882
01:20:21,321 --> 01:20:22,781
to save me.

883
01:20:29,746 --> 01:20:30,956
I'll see you tomorrow.

884
01:21:19,046 --> 01:21:19,963
Syd.

885
01:21:28,347 --> 01:21:29,264
Syd, are you okay?

886
01:21:29,431 --> 01:21:29,890
Yeah.

887
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:52,371
Thank you.

888
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:13,058
See, I just -- I don't see it. You working at a bank?

889
01:22:13,267 --> 01:22:15,143
Come on, what kind of job is that, you know?

890
01:22:15,227 --> 01:22:17,479
Cashing checks and making change.

891
01:22:17,813 --> 01:22:19,106
"Excuse me, next in line, please."

892
01:22:19,231 --> 01:22:20,399
I'm a loan officer.

893
01:22:20,524 --> 01:22:22,276
I travel. Service accounts.

894
01:22:22,401 --> 01:22:24,528
Wait a minute, the cover job you had for SD-6?

895
01:22:24,653 --> 01:22:25,904
- I happen to be good at it.
- Great.

896
01:22:25,988 --> 01:22:29,825
That's stimulating stuff. Watching someone else's cash.

897
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:34,371
Syd, come on, seriously, since you left the spy biz, you are a bore.

898
01:22:34,496 --> 01:22:35,581
It's an adjustment, is all.

899
01:22:35,664 --> 01:22:37,124
Are you sure you don't want to stay for dinner?

900
01:22:37,207 --> 01:22:39,418
I'd love to, but I gotta save the world.

901
01:22:40,085 --> 01:22:41,253
See ya.

902
01:22:42,129 --> 01:22:42,588
Bye.

903
01:22:45,591 --> 01:22:47,259
- Hello.
- Hi.

904
01:22:47,342 --> 01:22:50,929
I'm, uh, Eric Weiss, 38, single.

905
01:22:51,096 --> 01:22:52,973
- Nadia.
- How are you?

906
01:22:53,015 --> 01:22:55,058
Good. Is this a bad time?

907
01:22:55,309 --> 01:22:57,978
Not at all. Nadia, this is Eric. He was just leaving.

908
01:22:58,020 --> 01:22:59,897
No, no, no. I can stay.

909
01:23:01,023 --> 01:23:02,691
Or go. Nice to meet you.

910
01:23:02,774 --> 01:23:03,483
You too.

911
01:23:05,194 --> 01:23:08,363
- Hey.
- What's going on?

912
01:23:12,659 --> 01:23:14,077
I just couldn't wait.

913
01:23:15,204 --> 01:23:16,371
Even until tomorrow.

914
01:23:21,251 --> 01:23:24,046
I was hoping we could talk about our mother.

915
01:23:30,385 --> 01:23:31,845
Did you bring your passport?

916
01:23:46,485 --> 01:23:48,070
Our mother was killed.

917
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:51,448
I found her body in a state medical facility.

918
01:23:51,657 --> 01:23:54,159
I identified her, paid for her release.

919
01:23:54,243 --> 01:23:58,872
Made arrangements with a mausoleum in Moscow three blocks from where she was born.

920
01:23:58,997 --> 01:24:00,457
I thought she'd want it that way.

921
01:24:22,354 --> 01:24:25,774
And you have no idea who was responsible,

922
01:24:25,941 --> 01:24:27,067
who killed her?

923
01:24:30,737 --> 01:24:31,655
No.

924
01:24:36,326 --> 01:24:37,953
I swear to god,

925
01:24:38,412 --> 01:24:42,958
somehow I will find out who did this to our mother...

926
01:24:44,918 --> 01:24:47,337
and I will kill him.

927
01:24:48,547 --> 01:24:49,673
I will.

928
01:24:57,047 --> 01:25:00,000
