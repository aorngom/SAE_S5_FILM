1
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,482
  

2
00:00:38,651 --> 00:00:39,785
  

3
00:00:41,562 --> 00:00:42,457
  

4
00:00:55,545 --> 00:00:57,156
  

5
00:00:58,418 --> 00:00:59,315
 

6
00:01:02,118 --> 00:01:03,921
  

7
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:10,827
  

8
00:01:15,501 --> 00:01:18,307
  

9
00:01:41,678 --> 00:01:42,813
- Hi.
- Hey.

10
00:01:50,338 --> 00:01:54,862
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

11
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,790
When something's bothering me, I go running.

12
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,110
You've gone twice in less than 12 hours.

13
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,190
Hello?

14
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:09,605
Hey, Vaughn.

15
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:10,951
Yeah, she's right here.

16
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:14,226
Thanks.

17
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:17,502
Hey.

18
00:02:21,005 --> 00:02:23,000
Sure. When do you want to meet?

19
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,267
It's definitely my father's handwriting.

20
00:02:25,547 --> 00:02:26,711
But these entries --

21
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:29,017
- I know.
- I don't understand.

22
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,656
They're dated after his death.

23
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:33,072
Now you know about as much as I do.

24
00:02:33,165 --> 00:02:35,589
I mean, either he didn't die when the CIA says he did,

25
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:37,583
which they may or may not know the truth about,

26
00:02:37,675 --> 00:02:39,557
or someone wants me to think he's still alive.

27
00:02:39,649 --> 00:02:41,071
You have nothing else but this?

28
00:02:41,165 --> 00:02:44,066
I tracked down a guy -- Murdoch. He's mentioned in there.

29
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,347
He claims to have been on a mission with my father in 1982.

30
00:02:48,328 --> 00:02:51,230
He says my dad shot him in the back and left him for dead.

31
00:02:51,277 --> 00:02:53,080
He called my father a traitor.

32
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:55,815
I don't know what to believe.

33
00:02:56,936 --> 00:02:58,072
What do we do?

34
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,348
Well, there are names of classified missions in there.

35
00:03:00,442 --> 00:03:03,486
Let's get the details. I need access to all operational archives.

36
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,047
Now, I could put in a request to Langley --

37
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:06,897
But if someone is orchestrating this internally,

38
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:10,083
you don't want your name on an official request. I can do that.

39
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:12,574
You sure you don't mind?

40
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:13,373
Vaughn.

41
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,099
If your father's alive, we'll find him.

42
00:03:17,518 --> 00:03:20,516
And if he's not, we will find the person who's doing this.

43
00:03:25,095 --> 00:03:28,857
The Belarussian institute of science has developed a next-gen optical component.

44
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:30,706
It's called amplifying glass.

45
00:03:30,985 --> 00:03:33,457
Now what is amazing about this is --

46
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,957
well, if my math is correct --

47
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:37,785
and it is --

48
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:41,444
what they've developed could boost a laser pulse by a factor of 10,000.

49
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,291
Maybe even higher.

50
00:03:42,384 --> 00:03:45,299
Meaning you could take a simple aluminum gallium arsenide laser and --

51
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,851
uh, let me --

52
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,512
oh, you know how a cd player has a laser that will allow you to --

53
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:54,079
well, you take that laser, you amplify it by this lens,

54
00:03:54,171 --> 00:03:55,928
you could shoot down a plane from the sky.

55
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:58,016
Or, you know, you take a tank, slice it in half.

56
00:03:58,109 --> 00:03:59,531
Or you could even have an SUV --

57
00:03:59,624 --> 00:04:00,808
Right. We got it.

58
00:04:00,901 --> 00:04:02,226
We've been tracking intel which indicates

59
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,361
that the Jakarta faction wants the lens

60
00:04:04,408 --> 00:04:06,784
and they've employed this man to acquire it for them.

61
00:04:06,877 --> 00:04:10,209
His name is Cesar Martinez. He's an argentine resident.

62
00:04:12,779 --> 00:04:13,389
Hola.

63
00:04:14,558 --> 00:04:16,124
  

64
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:17,346
  

65
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,669
  

66
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:36,869
  

67
00:04:55,148 --> 00:04:56,524
  

68
00:04:56,616 --> 00:04:57,227
  

69
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:57,978
  

70
00:04:58,071 --> 00:04:58,633
  

71
00:04:58,679 --> 00:04:59,529
  

72
00:05:06,726 --> 00:05:10,249
A few days ago, I tasked Nadia with working up a profile of him.

73
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:11,663
Martinez is freelance.

74
00:05:11,757 --> 00:05:14,325
No loyalties. Excessive force -- that's his M.O.

75
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,597
He wrote his reputation with the execution of a former argentine intelligence officer --

76
00:05:19,072 --> 00:05:20,034
Roberto Fox.

77
00:05:23,117 --> 00:05:25,732
Any idea when Martinez is planning to make his move?

78
00:05:25,823 --> 00:05:28,588
Signal intercepts indicates that he's developing a team.

79
00:05:28,727 --> 00:05:30,007
It should be three days, a week at the most.

80
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:32,951
The institute of science is dedicating a new wing

81
00:05:33,043 --> 00:05:34,991
to its research facility tomorrow night.

82
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:38,749
So our mission is to obtain the amplifying glass before Martinez does.

83
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:39,929
Sydney, you're on point.

84
00:05:40,021 --> 00:05:42,780
Agent Vaughn, Weiss, and Santos, you'll be there for support.

85
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,200
This is a snatch-and-grab operation.

86
00:05:45,806 --> 00:05:47,132
Are there any questions?

87
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:50,595
Cesar!

88
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,248
Cesar!

89
00:05:57,196 --> 00:05:59,314
  

90
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:04,403
  

91
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:27,104
Hey.

92
00:06:33,695 --> 00:06:36,167
I knew him -- Roberto.

93
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:38,425
The man Cesar Martinez killed.

94
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:42,325
If this mission is too difficult, too personal for you,

95
00:06:43,353 --> 00:06:45,587
talk to your father and have him task someone else.

96
00:06:45,678 --> 00:06:47,768
It's my job. I'll make it work.

97
00:07:28,477 --> 00:07:30,331
Hey. Mitchell learned a new word.

98
00:07:30,515 --> 00:07:32,846
- What was the word?
- Booshnot.

99
00:07:33,031 --> 00:07:35,454
Mitchell's babyspeak for beta particle.

100
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:39,622
Uh,  anyway, here -- Sydney wanted me to give you these.

101
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,894
Access codes for the operational archives.

102
00:07:41,985 --> 00:07:44,410
She wanted me to give them to you to give to her.

103
00:07:45,016 --> 00:07:46,534
- Thanks.
- Sure.

104
00:07:50,552 --> 00:07:51,641
Anything else?

105
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,007
What's, uh...

106
00:07:54,268 --> 00:07:55,739
what's going on?

107
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:57,570
Nothing.

108
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:01,433
You're lying to me. Right? Come on.

109
00:08:01,573 --> 00:08:02,996
I'm smarter than you think.

110
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:04,223
I'll  tell you later.

111
00:08:04,643 --> 00:08:05,540
You don't trust me, do you?

112
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:06,367
Marshall.

113
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:08,693
Yeah. That's my fault.

114
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:12,642
I propagate that image. Just like high school, junior high, elementary --

115
00:08:12,968 --> 00:08:13,816
Marshall.

116
00:08:14,655 --> 00:08:17,320
We should have lunch sometime.

117
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:19,684
Really? Yeah?

118
00:08:20,337 --> 00:08:22,427
Oh, man, anytime. Absolutely. I'm there.

119
00:08:22,521 --> 00:08:23,464
Today?

120
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,592
No.

121
00:08:24,777 --> 00:08:25,962
No. That's cool.

122
00:08:26,054 --> 00:08:29,578
I got a lot of stuff to do in the, uh...

123
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:31,747
- Thanks.
- You got it.

124
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,118
See you at lunch.

125
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,560
'Sup, buddy?

126
00:08:55,658 --> 00:08:57,176
Outrigger, how we doing?

127
00:09:02,023 --> 00:09:03,339
10 seconds, Phoenix.

128
00:09:06,704 --> 00:09:07,888
The architect just arrived.

129
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:15,250
He has the PDA in his jacket.

130
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,468
Okay, great. Phoenix, you'll need to get right up next to him.

131
00:09:18,793 --> 00:09:19,785
Cozy like.

132
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:25,384
The architect is a security freak.

133
00:09:25,428 --> 00:09:27,567
He always carries copies of project files on him --

134
00:09:27,706 --> 00:09:29,319
blueprints, schedules, even sketches.

135
00:09:29,411 --> 00:09:31,692
So should show us which lab the glass is in.

136
00:09:31,786 --> 00:09:33,303
What's she using to clone his PDA?

137
00:09:33,395 --> 00:09:34,150
It's in her purse.

138
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,075
Low-frequency wi-fi scans and clones.

139
00:09:36,168 --> 00:09:38,830
Thing is, its working radius, it's only a couple of feet,

140
00:09:38,952 --> 00:09:40,946
which is why she needs to, you know, get right --

141
00:09:41,132 --> 00:09:42,792
Oh, here it comes.

142
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:45,370
Oh, great.

143
00:09:45,463 --> 00:09:46,979
Syd -- I'm sorry, Phoenix,

144
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,870
it's what I was afraid of.

145
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,580
It's encrypted.

146
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,140
The PDA -- it's protected with a handwriting recognition software,

147
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:54,858
so time to turn on the charm.

148
00:09:59,572 --> 00:10:04,559
  

149
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,625
  

150
00:10:06,653 --> 00:10:08,028
  

151
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:12,457
  

152
00:10:13,626 --> 00:10:15,429
  

153
00:10:20,664 --> 00:10:22,898
It's the look, the feel, the bend of paper,

154
00:10:23,037 --> 00:10:25,651
but actually it's a microscopic layer of nonconductive polymer,

155
00:10:25,744 --> 00:10:26,994
- and it's sandwiched --
- Marshall, not the time.

156
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:30,209
Vaughn asked me to lunch.

157
00:10:35,584 --> 00:10:37,196
Okay. Signature...

158
00:10:37,943 --> 00:10:39,078
plus a password...

159
00:10:39,637 --> 00:10:42,683
plus a little Flinkman secret sauce,

160
00:10:44,037 --> 00:10:45,697
and... nice.

161
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,641
Bow before me and weep, encryption gods.

162
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,362
  

163
00:10:52,454 --> 00:10:54,688
  

164
00:10:55,575 --> 00:10:58,478
  

165
00:11:05,394 --> 00:11:09,203
Okay, blueprints and security protocols for the research facility.

166
00:11:10,183 --> 00:11:11,654
I've got the location of the glass.

167
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,410
Evergreen, we're going to need that access key. You're a go.

168
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,813
Anyone have a visual on the scientist?

169
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:22,879
He's holding court, due east.

170
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:31,334
  

171
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:37,796
That was easy.

172
00:11:50,231 --> 00:11:51,987
  

173
00:11:56,895 --> 00:11:58,030
  

174
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,284
  

175
00:12:06,377 --> 00:12:07,943
  

176
00:12:09,346 --> 00:12:11,291
  

177
00:12:12,318 --> 00:12:14,457
  

178
00:12:15,532 --> 00:12:18,909
  

179
00:12:19,609 --> 00:12:23,686
  

180
00:12:25,881 --> 00:12:29,262
  

181
00:12:29,402 --> 00:12:31,922
   

182
00:12:36,174 --> 00:12:37,548
  

183
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:41,576
   

184
00:12:43,445 --> 00:12:45,535
   

185
00:12:45,722 --> 00:12:47,287
  

186
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:56,175
  

187
00:12:56,269 --> 00:12:57,785
  

188
00:12:58,747 --> 00:13:00,074
  

189
00:13:01,802 --> 00:13:05,994
  

190
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:11,514
  

191
00:13:13,476 --> 00:13:15,423
  

192
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:22,019
  

193
00:13:24,075 --> 00:13:25,975
  

194
00:13:28,394 --> 00:13:31,158
  

195
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,461
  

196
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,650
  

197
00:13:43,361 --> 00:13:45,690
  

198
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:53,194
   

199
00:14:04,581 --> 00:14:06,148
Okay, Merlin, showtime.

200
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:09,348
The  lab -- it's on the 15th floor. East corridor.

201
00:14:23,232 --> 00:14:25,274
  

202
00:14:25,552 --> 00:14:28,072
  

203
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:33,931
  

204
00:14:34,071 --> 00:14:37,976
  

205
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:42,645
  

206
00:14:42,785 --> 00:14:44,828
  

207
00:14:45,527 --> 00:14:49,814
  

208
00:14:55,141 --> 00:14:57,279
  

209
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:02,923
  

210
00:15:05,615 --> 00:15:10,237
  

211
00:15:11,405 --> 00:15:15,930
  

212
00:15:16,537 --> 00:15:22,828
  

213
00:15:23,527 --> 00:15:24,614
  

214
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:30,748
Martinez is here.

215
00:15:31,074 --> 00:15:33,547
Cesar Martinez is in the building.

216
00:15:41,352 --> 00:15:42,679
Anyone see his backup?

217
00:15:43,612 --> 00:15:45,034
Sit tight, Evergreen.

218
00:15:45,128 --> 00:15:46,978
This might be recon on his part.

219
00:15:47,117 --> 00:15:49,781
If this was recon, we would have known he was here.

220
00:15:49,873 --> 00:15:51,008
He's making his play.

221
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,548
- How do you know?
- Trust me.

222
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:54,518
We need to grab him.

223
00:15:54,611 --> 00:15:57,036
- Phoenix is almost inside.
- You don't understand.

224
00:16:05,353 --> 00:16:08,171
Phoenix, abort. Six hostiles on the move with force.

225
00:16:08,265 --> 00:16:09,066
I can make it.

226
00:17:38,056 --> 00:17:39,633
Who do you work for?

227
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:43,273
You forgot to say the magic word.

228
00:17:55,753 --> 00:17:57,747
Now you're gonna have to say "pretty please."

229
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,306
Last chance.

230
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:02,267
Who do you work for?

231
00:18:02,827 --> 00:18:04,249
She works with me.

232
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,959
Nadia?

233
00:18:13,838 --> 00:18:17,265
   

234
00:18:41,902 --> 00:18:43,418
  

235
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,933
He had his men secure us in the lab.

236
00:19:00,025 --> 00:19:02,068
By the time we escaped, he was gone.

237
00:19:02,302 --> 00:19:04,822
When I tasked you to do research on Cesar Martinez,

238
00:19:04,914 --> 00:19:07,674
why didn't you inform me the two of you knew each other?

239
00:19:07,906 --> 00:19:09,662
He was not supposed to be there.

240
00:19:09,803 --> 00:19:11,510
I didn't know we'd make contact.

241
00:19:12,024 --> 00:19:15,737
You knowingly withheld intel that would have altered options during the operation.

242
00:19:16,484 --> 00:19:19,290
I've suspended agents from field duty for less than that, Nadia.

243
00:19:19,383 --> 00:19:22,141
Her knowing Martinez was the only thing that saved my life.

244
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:26,593
The story, Nadia -- what is it?

245
00:19:27,246 --> 00:19:29,527
We met when I was young.

246
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,567
After the orphanage, I was on my own,

247
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,989
and Cesar was one of the boys I ran around with.

248
00:19:35,671 --> 00:19:37,764
We got in trouble with the police.

249
00:19:38,087 --> 00:19:39,796
We went our separate ways.

250
00:19:41,524 --> 00:19:43,376
Why do I feel there's more?

251
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:47,100
If you want me to sit at a desk after this, fine.

252
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,120
But it is personal now.

253
00:19:49,492 --> 00:19:52,632
Please, let me get the glass back from Cesar.

254
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,096
I know how to contact him. I can do it.

255
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:58,139
She had a relationship with him. She can use him.

256
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:02,584
You of all people should appreciate that.

257
00:20:04,173 --> 00:20:05,785
Reach out to Martinez.

258
00:20:05,878 --> 00:20:07,348
He's acquiring this for somebody else.

259
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:09,435
Find out if we can buy it for ourselves.

260
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:12,042
Sydney, you and Weiss will be backup on this.

261
00:20:13,678 --> 00:20:15,434
Let me be clear, Nadia.

262
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:19,019
I expect full disclosure from you.

263
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:27,402
  

264
00:20:27,634 --> 00:20:30,728
  

265
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,037
  

266
00:20:33,176 --> 00:20:34,646
 

267
00:20:37,356 --> 00:20:39,829
  

268
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,107
  

269
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:44,978
  

270
00:20:46,426 --> 00:20:47,228
  

271
00:20:56,996 --> 00:21:00,137
  

272
00:21:00,324 --> 00:21:02,032
  

273
00:21:02,171 --> 00:21:04,310
  

274
00:21:04,635 --> 00:21:07,728
  

275
00:21:08,194 --> 00:21:09,950
  

276
00:21:10,043 --> 00:21:13,757
  

277
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:24,155
  

278
00:21:27,378 --> 00:21:28,036
Bueno.

279
00:21:44,162 --> 00:21:46,872
Withholding information from Sloane I can accept.

280
00:21:47,058 --> 00:21:48,269
I don't care much, really. But from me?

281
00:21:48,316 --> 00:21:50,693
You and I are in the field together.

282
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,448
I need to know there's a level of trust.

283
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:53,771
What do you want to know?

284
00:21:53,957 --> 00:21:55,665
What did Martinez whisper to you?

285
00:21:56,411 --> 00:21:58,550
I told you. He said "call me."

286
00:21:58,736 --> 00:22:00,254
Sydney, that's it.

287
00:22:00,954 --> 00:22:02,519
Are you telling me there's nothing else?

288
00:22:02,894 --> 00:22:06,780
For the last time, I'm sorry I didn't tell you about Cesar.

289
00:22:07,106 --> 00:22:09,244
But there's nothing else you need to know.

290
00:22:26,305 --> 00:22:27,850
  

291
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,316
  

292
00:22:32,072 --> 00:22:33,161
  

293
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,853
  

294
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:39,252
  

295
00:22:48,085 --> 00:22:49,270
  

296
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,592
  

297
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,866
  

298
00:22:58,464 --> 00:22:59,315
  

299
00:23:00,201 --> 00:23:01,623
  

300
00:23:01,978 --> 00:23:03,209
   

301
00:23:06,855 --> 00:23:10,710
  

302
00:23:11,272 --> 00:23:13,074
  

303
00:23:13,914 --> 00:23:15,384
  

304
00:23:15,571 --> 00:23:16,515
  

305
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,198
Sí.

306
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,035
How's it going?

307
00:23:30,266 --> 00:23:32,930
I cross-check my father's list against the CIA archives,

308
00:23:33,068 --> 00:23:36,161
and there are still missions I can't verify even existed.

309
00:23:38,076 --> 00:23:41,170
Am I insane to think this old journal's going to help me find my father?

310
00:23:42,385 --> 00:23:44,523
These are the ones you can't find?

311
00:23:44,616 --> 00:23:45,038
Yeah.

312
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,981
Give me the pen.

313
00:23:49,634 --> 00:23:51,392
What if these aren't operation names?

314
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:53,175
What are you doing?

315
00:23:53,453 --> 00:23:55,591
Substitution cipher.

316
00:23:58,256 --> 00:23:59,771
Okay, how'd you see that?

317
00:24:00,146 --> 00:24:03,429
My father used to encrypt my crossword puzzles when I was a kid.

318
00:24:03,801 --> 00:24:06,178
The least of my childhood dysfunctions.

319
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:10,626
Try that.

320
00:24:11,796 --> 00:24:12,738
When's your plane leave?

321
00:24:12,878 --> 00:24:14,635
Half an hour.

322
00:24:14,681 --> 00:24:16,246
I wish I could stay.

323
00:24:16,975 --> 00:24:20,211
Yeah, I'll, I'll take it from here.

324
00:24:55,502 --> 00:24:56,305
Nadia.

325
00:25:01,025 --> 00:25:01,665
Hola.

326
00:25:02,645 --> 00:25:03,115
Hola.

327
00:25:05,825 --> 00:25:08,679
  

328
00:25:09,987 --> 00:25:12,411
  

329
00:25:14,329 --> 00:25:15,180
  

330
00:25:15,459 --> 00:25:18,121
  

331
00:25:18,307 --> 00:25:19,394
  

332
00:25:20,328 --> 00:25:21,798
  

333
00:25:22,171 --> 00:25:25,216
  

334
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:27,911
  

335
00:25:28,565 --> 00:25:29,939
  

336
00:25:30,078 --> 00:25:32,885
  

337
00:25:33,351 --> 00:25:34,773
  

338
00:25:36,222 --> 00:25:40,795
  

339
00:25:41,449 --> 00:25:44,397
  

340
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:48,615
  

341
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:53,461
  

342
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,309
  

343
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:57,244
  

344
00:25:58,533 --> 00:26:00,051
Nadia...

345
00:26:01,219 --> 00:26:03,070
  

346
00:26:03,957 --> 00:26:05,760
  

347
00:26:06,227 --> 00:26:07,553
  

348
00:26:08,721 --> 00:26:10,382
  

349
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:13,665
  

350
00:26:16,891 --> 00:26:18,122
  

351
00:26:18,963 --> 00:26:19,620
  

352
00:26:21,209 --> 00:26:25,428
  

353
00:26:30,523 --> 00:26:32,327
  

354
00:26:36,954 --> 00:26:38,472
  

355
00:26:40,668 --> 00:26:41,994
  

356
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:43,028
  

357
00:26:45,131 --> 00:26:47,890
  

358
00:26:48,402 --> 00:26:50,064
  

359
00:26:50,203 --> 00:26:52,052
  

360
00:26:52,192 --> 00:26:53,903
  

361
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:57,978
  

362
00:27:00,174 --> 00:27:01,675
  

363
00:27:02,981 --> 00:27:04,784
  

364
00:27:05,391 --> 00:27:08,388
  

365
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,651
  

366
00:27:11,883 --> 00:27:13,925
  

367
00:27:14,018 --> 00:27:16,348
Evergreen, you cannot proceed without comms.

368
00:27:16,907 --> 00:27:19,475
  

369
00:27:19,801 --> 00:27:21,558
  

370
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:26,119
Evergreen, abort this mission now.

371
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:30,523
Nadia...

372
00:27:32,671 --> 00:27:35,574
  

373
00:27:36,508 --> 00:27:37,357
  

374
00:27:48,022 --> 00:27:49,566
What the hell is she doing?

375
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,166
Portugal.

376
00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:35,405
  

377
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:38,290
  

378
00:28:38,942 --> 00:28:39,887
  

379
00:28:50,357 --> 00:28:51,111
  

380
00:28:51,717 --> 00:28:52,900
  

381
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:57,561
  

382
00:29:00,207 --> 00:29:01,628
All right, I'll go this way.

383
00:29:01,722 --> 00:29:02,051
Okay.

384
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,733
  

385
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,101
  

386
00:29:09,287 --> 00:29:11,903
  

387
00:29:12,556 --> 00:29:16,127
  

388
00:29:19,631 --> 00:29:20,433
  

389
00:29:46,424 --> 00:29:47,130
Syd.

390
00:29:48,532 --> 00:29:49,333
Anything?

391
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:52,471
Ah, come on.

392
00:29:57,191 --> 00:29:58,233
  

393
00:30:01,409 --> 00:30:02,735
  

394
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:05,454
  

395
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,039
  

396
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:12,331
  

397
00:30:43,933 --> 00:30:45,593
  

398
00:30:46,856 --> 00:30:48,802
  

399
00:30:49,175 --> 00:30:52,124
  

400
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,228
  

401
00:30:58,956 --> 00:31:01,476
  

402
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,707
  

403
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:07,175
  

404
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:32,110
  

405
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:53,721
  

406
00:31:56,898 --> 00:31:57,939
  

407
00:33:26,607 --> 00:33:27,552
Diego?

408
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:33,496
Diego.

409
00:33:35,693 --> 00:33:36,589
Dios mío.

410
00:33:36,728 --> 00:33:38,055
  

411
00:33:40,236 --> 00:33:41,699
  

412
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,665
  

413
00:33:49,758 --> 00:33:50,416
No!

414
00:33:52,192 --> 00:33:54,233
  

415
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:57,024
  

416
00:33:57,818 --> 00:34:00,958
  

417
00:34:03,052 --> 00:34:04,287
  

418
00:34:05,828 --> 00:34:08,014
  

419
00:34:09,229 --> 00:34:10,079
  

420
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,549
  

421
00:34:12,156 --> 00:34:13,244
Nadia...

422
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:17,272
  

423
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:20,023
  

424
00:34:21,423 --> 00:34:21,986
No.

425
00:34:23,763 --> 00:34:24,468
No.

426
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:29,173
  

427
00:34:29,499 --> 00:34:30,683
  

428
00:34:33,177 --> 00:34:35,319
  

429
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,528
  

430
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:38,185
  

431
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,738
Diego. Diego.

432
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,719
Diego!

433
00:34:55,292 --> 00:34:56,665
  

434
00:34:56,851 --> 00:35:01,042
  

435
00:35:01,321 --> 00:35:02,935
  

436
00:35:14,901 --> 00:35:16,799
  

437
00:35:18,528 --> 00:35:21,144
  

438
00:35:22,545 --> 00:35:23,298
  

439
00:35:24,887 --> 00:35:26,118
  

440
00:35:32,942 --> 00:35:34,698
  

441
00:35:39,793 --> 00:35:41,119
  

442
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,839
  

443
00:35:49,997 --> 00:35:51,611
  

444
00:35:53,713 --> 00:35:54,466
  

445
00:35:59,981 --> 00:36:01,689
We lost him here at Plaza Del Camino.

446
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:03,634
Yeah, Martinez said he was taking her to his office

447
00:36:03,725 --> 00:36:05,242
to make the exchange. It's got to be close.

448
00:36:05,382 --> 00:36:08,236
Since learning of Nadia's history with Martinez, I did some digging.

449
00:36:08,421 --> 00:36:10,655
Martinez owns several pieces of property,

450
00:36:10,748 --> 00:36:14,457
including Roberto Fox's training facility.

451
00:36:16,596 --> 00:36:18,888
  

452
00:36:19,309 --> 00:36:20,397
  

453
00:36:20,816 --> 00:36:26,201
  

454
00:36:27,649 --> 00:36:28,593
  

455
00:36:29,882 --> 00:36:31,399
  

456
00:36:32,332 --> 00:36:35,855
  

457
00:36:38,658 --> 00:36:42,468
  

458
00:36:46,253 --> 00:36:50,061
  

459
00:36:51,602 --> 00:36:55,124
  

460
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:59,130
  

461
00:36:59,829 --> 00:37:01,537
  

462
00:37:05,631 --> 00:37:11,826
  

463
00:37:14,631 --> 00:37:16,673
  

464
00:37:20,691 --> 00:37:24,739
  

465
00:37:26,281 --> 00:37:29,898
  

466
00:37:31,673 --> 00:37:32,953
  

467
00:37:46,789 --> 00:37:48,019
  

468
00:37:48,346 --> 00:37:50,149
  

469
00:37:54,728 --> 00:37:56,487
  

470
00:37:58,868 --> 00:38:00,958
  

471
00:38:01,005 --> 00:38:02,056
Nadia.

472
00:38:21,196 --> 00:38:25,151
  

473
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,195
  

474
00:38:36,224 --> 00:38:40,130
   

475
00:38:41,298 --> 00:38:43,959
   

476
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:48,269
  

477
00:38:49,017 --> 00:38:51,298
  

478
00:38:51,389 --> 00:38:53,988
  

479
00:38:55,763 --> 00:38:57,423
  

480
00:38:59,058 --> 00:39:04,246
  

481
00:39:05,113 --> 00:39:06,469
  

482
00:39:08,114 --> 00:39:09,871
  

483
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,237
  

484
00:39:58,817 --> 00:39:59,665
Nadia!

485
00:40:02,471 --> 00:40:03,081
Nadia.

486
00:40:03,406 --> 00:40:04,762
I'm fine.

487
00:40:05,555 --> 00:40:06,690
There's a safe inside.

488
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:08,347
The amplifying glass should be there.

489
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,480
All right, come on.

490
00:41:04,034 --> 00:41:06,267
The first and only time I met your father,

491
00:41:06,407 --> 00:41:09,261
he was covered in blood with a baby in his arms.

492
00:41:09,353 --> 00:41:10,108
Nadia.

493
00:41:10,295 --> 00:41:13,195
He brought her to the orphanage in Buenos Aires.

494
00:41:13,428 --> 00:41:15,328
He said she was in danger.

495
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:18,059
He'd been shot in the shoulder.

496
00:41:18,431 --> 00:41:20,761
I knew not to ask too many questions.

497
00:41:21,602 --> 00:41:23,884
Your father, he stayed for a few days,

498
00:41:24,257 --> 00:41:27,111
until he was well enough to travel.

499
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,671
One morning I woke up and he was gone.

500
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,284
I don't understand.

501
00:41:33,378 --> 00:41:34,753
If he knew you in Buenos Aires,

502
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:39,131
why would he encode this address in Lisbon in his journal?

503
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:40,693
I don't know.

504
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:45,471
You thought he might be here.

505
00:41:46,919 --> 00:41:48,340
I am sorry.

506
00:41:49,537 --> 00:41:51,579
I wish I knew more.

507
00:41:52,139 --> 00:41:55,518
Can you remember anything? Something he said, maybe a detail?

508
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:59,931
Nightingale.

509
00:42:00,865 --> 00:42:01,762
Nightingale?

510
00:42:02,276 --> 00:42:07,660
He was on the phone, and something in his voice --

511
00:42:07,798 --> 00:42:09,508
It was important to him.

512
00:42:15,255 --> 00:42:17,154
May I ask you a question?

513
00:42:18,865 --> 00:42:19,618
Sure.

514
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:24,116
Nadia -- how is she?

515
00:42:24,629 --> 00:42:25,765
She's good.

516
