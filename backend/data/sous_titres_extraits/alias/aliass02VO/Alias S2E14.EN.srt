Previously on <i>Alias:</i>

2
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:08,473
Tonight at 2200 hours, the CIA will conduct
simultaneous raids on all Alliance facilities.

3
00:00:08,566 --> 00:00:13,857
And tomorrow morning, God willing,
the Alliance will no longer exist.

4
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:18,692
- Let's move in.
- Go. Go. Go.

5
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:29,162
- Three agents down at SD-2.
- SD-9 has four down.

6
00:00:30,338 --> 00:00:32,414
We've gotten reports
from all team leaders.

7
00:00:32,507 --> 00:00:35,923
We appear to be in control
of all Alliance facilities.

8
00:00:41,432 --> 00:00:45,216
So congratulations, sir.
The Alliance is gone.

9
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:48,597
I just wanted to let you know
that Phase One is complete.

10
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,607
Good. Move on to Phase Two.

11
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:55,272
I've been asked to confirm
that you are in position.

12
00:00:55,363 --> 00:00:57,071
Yes.

13
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:00,276
Everything's in place.

14
00:01:34,235 --> 00:01:38,150
Maybe when we're done here,
we should go back to Fiji.

15
00:01:39,073 --> 00:01:41,647
Yeah, we should.

16
00:01:41,743 --> 00:01:44,234
It was so great.

17
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:04,424
I'm gonna take a shower.

18
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,872
- You're early.
- I've been compromised.

19
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,130
How?

20
00:03:22,218 --> 00:03:25,801
Something I said.
How do you want me to handle it?

21
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:28,973
Use her to send a message.

22
00:03:29,058 --> 00:03:31,549
Make it public.

23
00:03:58,463 --> 00:04:01,168
I heard you were here.

24
00:04:03,468 --> 00:04:05,793
I couldn't sleep.

25
00:04:05,887 --> 00:04:09,422
I was afraid I'd wake up
and find out this was a dream.

26
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:13,015
I went for a run to clear my mind
and I ended up here.

27
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:18,354
- Any word on Dixon and Marshall?
- They'll be in debrief for a while.

28
00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:23,150
Meanwhile, Sloane's been put
on Interpol's most wanted list.

29
00:04:27,117 --> 00:04:28,860
- About last night...
- Is this gonna be about Alice?

30
00:04:28,952 --> 00:04:33,080
- I know it's complicated.
- We're not together any more.

31
00:04:33,164 --> 00:04:35,702
- Since when?
- Since this morning.

32
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:39,208
The truth is,
we'd been over for a long time.

33
00:04:48,471 --> 00:04:50,547
I was thinking...

34
00:04:52,016 --> 00:04:56,310
I can actually go to the CIA
through the front door.

35
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:59,470
And I can actually give you a ride.

36
00:05:31,473 --> 00:05:34,390
Folks, this is Christine Phillips,
our new Clandestine Services graduate.

37
00:05:34,476 --> 00:05:37,476
Langley's approved her observing
our operations over the next few months.

38
00:05:37,562 --> 00:05:40,848
- Hi.
- FBI Assistant Director Kendall.

39
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,562
This is Agent Michael Vaughn.
Agents Jack and Sydney Bristow.

40
00:05:43,651 --> 00:05:46,736
I've read your operational file.
It's a real honour.

41
00:05:46,821 --> 00:05:47,651
Thanks.

42
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:05,839
Sir, we got a situation in Berlin.
The networks are carrying it live.

43
00:06:05,924 --> 00:06:08,759
- I'm putting it through to central display.
- This is all that we know so far.

44
00:06:08,843 --> 00:06:14,217
A woman apparently has been shoved out
of a van, a speeding white van, we're told.

45
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,885
This is in a public square...

46
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,217
- Oh, my God.
- Sir, that's Agent Wallace.

47
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,884
- You know her?
- She's one of ours.

48
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:35,909
Give me a better look
at those explosives.

49
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:39,080
- Looks like C-4.
- If the C-4's wired with a remote trigger

50
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:42,830
any radio communication
could cause detonation.

51
00:06:46,548 --> 00:06:48,706
You're doing fine, Emma.

52
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:53,510
Just do what I told you and you'll be fine.

53
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:04,230
Patch me through to the federal office
in Berlin. You speak German, right?

54
00:07:04,315 --> 00:07:06,438
We'll have satellite coverage
in the next 30 seconds.

55
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,982
KH-11 coming on line now.

56
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,822
Bump up the resolution.

57
00:07:23,668 --> 00:07:26,835
Sir, I've got the federal office
on the line now.

58
00:07:26,921 --> 00:07:30,337
Tell them to put you through to the ranking
agent on site. Tell them the woman is CIA

59
00:07:30,425 --> 00:07:35,170
and any random radio communication
could detonate the explosives.

60
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:54,988
All around the cobbler's bench
The monkey chased the weasel

61
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:59,203
The monkey thought it was all for good

62
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:08,118
Pop goes the weasel

63
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:15,050
A penny for a spool of thread

64
00:08:15,136 --> 00:08:19,383
A penny for a needle

65
00:08:19,474 --> 00:08:23,851
That's the way the money goes

66
00:08:25,063 --> 00:08:30,401
- Pop goes the weasel...
- Come on, come on, come on, come on.

67
00:08:36,574 --> 00:08:37,606
I speak English.

68
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,867
No patience to wait till time goes by

69
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:45,497
We're monitoring the situation. Instruct
your agents to cease radio communication.

70
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,790
This woman may be wired
with a remote detonator. I repeat...

71
00:08:47,877 --> 00:08:51,661
Agent Bristow,
I have already ordered radio silence.

72
00:08:51,756 --> 00:08:53,416
Pop...

73
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:30,285
Excuse me.

74
00:09:32,046 --> 00:09:34,834
Are you all right?

75
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:40,136
- Hi.
- Are you OK?

76
00:09:40,221 --> 00:09:43,507
Sorry, I just wasn't ready for that.

77
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,186
Don't be sorry.

78
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,188
The CIA lost an exemplary agent today.

79
00:09:50,982 --> 00:09:53,390
Those of you who knew Emma Wallace
may find it difficult to focus,

80
00:09:53,485 --> 00:09:56,058
but I'll ask you to try.

81
00:09:56,154 --> 00:09:59,155
For the last two months, she was tasked
with a deep-cover assignment.

82
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,986
Her objective was to gain
the trust of this man.

83
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:06,616
Dr Renzo Markovic,
a former R & D scientist

84
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,829
who's been developing
a new classified technology

85
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:11,586
under the project heading "Helix".

86
00:10:11,669 --> 00:10:15,204
He's already received preliminary bids
from several terrorist organisations.

87
00:10:15,298 --> 00:10:16,923
- Weapons?
- We don't know.

88
00:10:17,008 --> 00:10:20,709
That's the question that Agent Wallace was
trying to answer before she was murdered.

89
00:10:20,804 --> 00:10:24,219
Agent Wallace may not be the only
casualty in our effort against Markovic.

90
00:10:24,307 --> 00:10:27,593
She was sent undercover
with a partner, another CIA operative,

91
00:10:27,685 --> 00:10:30,223
whom we now presume
to be captured or dead.

92
00:10:30,313 --> 00:10:34,062
His final satellite transmission indicated
he was proceeding to Cayo Concha,

93
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,902
off the coast of the Dominican Republic.

94
00:10:36,986 --> 00:10:40,687
Markovic leases one of the lower floors
in the Sirena del Sol resort,

95
00:10:40,782 --> 00:10:45,111
where he conducts his research. If our
operative's still alive, he's being held there.

96
00:10:45,203 --> 00:10:48,287
Agent Bristow, you're on point.
Agent Vaughn, you'll be assisting.

97
00:10:48,373 --> 00:10:53,035
Conditions for success are twofold.
Acquire what intel you can on Project Helix.

98
00:10:53,128 --> 00:10:55,619
- And bring our man home.
- Who is he?

99
00:10:55,713 --> 00:10:59,628
He's one of our most decorated agents.
Here's his file.

100
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,880
James Lennox.
You leave tonight.

101
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,147
- Hi.
- Hi.

102
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:20,362
- Ready to go?
- Yeah, come on in, I'll get my stuff.

103
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,609
Nice place.

104
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:32,664
- I'm gonna get a new couch.
- Yeah?

105
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,827
I don't know.

106
00:11:36,504 --> 00:11:39,209
So this is where you live?

107
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:45,089
- This is where I live.
- I love it.

108
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:49,058
I'm ready.

109
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:59,148
OK, we should go right now.

110
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:01,228
- Hey.
- Francie.

111
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,860
- This is Michael, from the bank.
- Hiya, Francie, nice to meet you.

112
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,572
- Nice to put a face with the name.
- Same here.

113
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,617
- We should catch our plane.
- Another business trip?

114
00:12:12,707 --> 00:12:15,494
Just a finance conference
in New York, just overnight.

115
00:12:15,585 --> 00:12:17,874
- Have a good trip, you guys.
- Thanks. It's nice to meet you.

116
00:12:17,962 --> 00:12:19,622
- You too.
- Bye.

117
00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:23,212
I'll see you later.

118
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:05,045
It's so easy to blow up your problems

119
00:13:05,135 --> 00:13:09,346
It's so easy to play up your breakdown

120
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:13,380
It's so easy to fly through a window

121
00:13:14,352 --> 00:13:17,306
Arden Jezek. He's Markovic's
chief of security at the resort,

122
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,389
which means he's got access
to Project Helix

123
00:13:19,482 --> 00:13:21,522
and probably knows
where Lennox is being held.

124
00:13:21,609 --> 00:13:23,401
Why aren't we going
after Markovic directly?

125
00:13:23,486 --> 00:13:26,440
Our surveillance teams say
they lost track of him four weeks ago.

126
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:27,859
Jezek's our best shot.

127
00:14:03,568 --> 00:14:07,732
It's so tough to get up

128
00:14:07,822 --> 00:14:10,230
It's so tough

129
00:14:10,325 --> 00:14:12,234
Hi.

130
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,699
I've injected you with a cardiotoxin.
You'll have a heart attack within the hour

131
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:22,667
unless you do exactly as we say.

132
00:14:22,754 --> 00:14:25,624
- Then you get the antidote. Are we clear?
- Yeah.

133
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:28,420
- Is Agent Lennox still alive?
- Yes.

134
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,179
Where is he?

135
00:14:31,262 --> 00:14:33,932
Sublevel, room 47.

136
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,798
You'll escort us down there

137
00:14:36,893 --> 00:14:41,187
and you will help my partner download
everything you have on Project Helix.

138
00:14:42,273 --> 00:14:44,147
Smile.

139
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:48,643
They are with me.

140
00:14:58,706 --> 00:15:01,873
- I'll see you at the exit point.
- Yeah.

141
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:12,335
Sydney.
If Agent Lennox is still alive,

142
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:14,966
he may have undergone
psychological reconditioning.

143
00:15:15,056 --> 00:15:16,515
You could be walking into a trap.

144
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:34,197
- Let's start over, from the beginning.
- I've already told you everything.

145
00:15:55,138 --> 00:16:00,298
My name is Sydney Bristow. I'm a CIA
agent. I've come to take you home.

146
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:03,560
I can't see. I can't see.

147
00:16:03,646 --> 00:16:05,722
I can't see.

148
00:16:07,442 --> 00:16:11,274
They used metachlorazine on you.
It's a photoreactive acid.

149
00:16:11,362 --> 00:16:13,604
I'm covering your eyes with a bandage.

150
00:16:13,698 --> 00:16:19,119
Keep this bandage on or you could be
permanently blinded. You're OK.

151
00:16:20,538 --> 00:16:26,577
You're sweating because the poison's
taking effect. Type and you'll be fine.

152
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:29,505
You're in the system.

153
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:42,842
- You're doing great, we're almost out.
- My partner, has she reported in yet?

154
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:47,642
- What happened?
- Stay here.

155
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:27,678
Thank you. Shut your eyes.
Shut your eyes.

156
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,896
OK, one more.

157
00:17:39,576 --> 00:17:41,402
Oh, man.

158
00:17:44,414 --> 00:17:47,368
Your eyes should normalise
in a few minutes.

159
00:17:47,459 --> 00:17:49,119
OK.

160
00:17:50,712 --> 00:17:52,503
Thank you.

161
00:17:55,717 --> 00:17:58,089
You OK?

162
00:18:01,431 --> 00:18:03,756
What do you think?

163
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,973
No signs of any
post-traumatic stress disorder

164
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,598
or symptoms of behaviour modification.

165
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,562
He was holding his own
with the interrogators

166
00:18:10,648 --> 00:18:13,815
and he risked losing his sight
to get us out.

167
00:18:15,069 --> 00:18:17,691
I don't know.

168
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:26,119
We'll know more after the psych eval.

169
00:18:33,338 --> 00:18:37,466
- How are you doing?
- I could've sworn you were a blonde.

170
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,879
I was.

171
00:18:38,968 --> 00:18:43,511
My hair's usually brown.
Hard to keep track.

172
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:49,846
It's nice to see the face
of the person who saved my life.

173
00:18:53,274 --> 00:18:56,774
So, um...

174
00:18:56,861 --> 00:18:59,399
where is, uh, Emma?

175
00:19:00,323 --> 00:19:02,648
Is she, uh...

176
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:05,613
Is she back in LA?

177
00:19:07,288 --> 00:19:08,948
Jim...

178
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:14,754
Emma's dead.

179
00:19:18,174 --> 00:19:20,712
I'm so sorry.

180
00:19:30,854 --> 00:19:33,226
We know that you've been through hell,
Agent Lennox,

181
00:19:33,314 --> 00:19:37,098
and I apologise that your homecoming had
to be celebrated with a psych evaluation,

182
00:19:37,193 --> 00:19:40,028
but you've been given
a clean bill of health

183
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:43,197
even though I'm sure
it doesn't feel like that.

184
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:46,070
Agent Wallace's death has left several
questions unanswered.

185
00:19:46,161 --> 00:19:50,289
Can you tell us how you infiltrated
Dr Markovic's organisation?

186
00:19:50,373 --> 00:19:54,667
We were hired on as freelance security
experts at his villa in Berlin.

187
00:19:54,752 --> 00:20:00,707
Emma... Agent Wallace gained Markovic's
trust enough to become his driver.

188
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,374
In that capacity,
she was privy to a phone conversation

189
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:06,720
between Markovic and someone
she believed to be his superior,

190
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:10,341
in which they indicated Project Helix
was ready for testing.

191
00:20:10,435 --> 00:20:13,222
Are you saying that Markovic
answers to someone else?

192
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:15,720
That was Agent Wallace's impression
based on the conversation.

193
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:18,852
They didn't use names,
it was just a voice on the speakerphone.

194
00:20:18,943 --> 00:20:22,562
- And you never heard this voice yourself?
- No.

195
00:20:24,449 --> 00:20:26,607
How's your eyesight?

196
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:30,913
- It's better.
- Can you tell us what led to your capture?

197
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:33,286
When we reported to Langley
the project was proceeding,

198
00:20:33,374 --> 00:20:36,708
we were ordered to break into
the facility in Cayo Concha

199
00:20:36,795 --> 00:20:40,709
and hack the central database. I knew
there was a good chance we'd be caught.

200
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,250
I decided to go in alone so I could transmit
the data to Emma in Berlin

201
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:47,095
if I were trapped.

202
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,505
They moved in before I could do that.

203
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:51,757
Do you have any idea
how she was compromised?

204
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:54,307
No, I don't.

205
00:20:56,147 --> 00:20:59,184
OK. I think we have a pretty
comprehensive picture here.

206
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:01,897
There's a driver waiting
to take you to a safe house nearby.

207
00:21:01,986 --> 00:21:04,560
Is there anything you'd like to add?

208
00:21:08,952 --> 00:21:11,739
We were engaged.

209
00:21:25,135 --> 00:21:28,800
In a case like this, we start by digitising the
news footage that covered the bombing.

210
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:30,382
Uh-huh.

211
00:21:30,473 --> 00:21:32,929
You, uh, you like Italian food?

212
00:21:33,017 --> 00:21:35,769
I have a boyfriend.

213
00:21:35,854 --> 00:21:38,261
- Yeah. Me too.
- Hey, Weiss.

214
00:21:39,524 --> 00:21:41,813
Excuse me.

215
00:21:42,777 --> 00:21:44,153
I think the new girl has a thing for me.

216
00:21:44,237 --> 00:21:46,277
I was going over
Agent Wallace's contact log.

217
00:21:46,364 --> 00:21:48,404
Now, she phoned in
every two days like clockwork.

218
00:21:48,491 --> 00:21:50,151
I mean, the slightest
discrepancy in protocol

219
00:21:50,243 --> 00:21:51,986
and she contacted us for verification.

220
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:54,237
- Your point being?
- The day Lennox says he was captured,

221
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:58,198
we have no records of anything from her.
No warning, no extraction request, nothing.

222
00:21:58,293 --> 00:22:00,997
Why didn't she make contact?

223
00:22:03,173 --> 00:22:05,296
Agent Weiss.

224
00:22:05,383 --> 00:22:07,423
Roll it back.

225
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,918
That flash of static right before the blast.

226
00:22:10,013 --> 00:22:12,171
An RF transmitter would account
for the interference,

227
00:22:12,265 --> 00:22:14,056
but all radio signals were shut off.

228
00:22:14,142 --> 00:22:17,059
Wait, uh, run it back.
Slow it down a little bit.

229
00:22:17,145 --> 00:22:20,015
- There.
- So if the signal interrupted the feed,

230
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:22,015
it had to have come
from our triggerman's detonator.

231
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:24,065
Which would place him
within a block of this camera.

232
00:22:24,152 --> 00:22:27,106
All right, find out where the news van
was parked. Check all ATMs, traffic cams.

233
00:22:27,197 --> 00:22:30,281
All right? We may just have
this guy's face on video.

234
00:22:41,294 --> 00:22:43,168
Lennox?

235
00:23:01,272 --> 00:23:03,064
Jim?

236
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,407
Beware of the grieving man
and his bottle.

237
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,793
Emma used to say

238
00:23:26,881 --> 00:23:32,670
that she had spent so much of her life
pretending to be other people

239
00:23:32,762 --> 00:23:35,467
that she was afraid she might disappear.

240
00:23:35,557 --> 00:23:42,224
I have been sitting here
trying to remember all her aliases.

241
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:46,061
You're right.

242
00:23:46,151 --> 00:23:48,772
It's hard to keep track.

243
00:23:56,744 --> 00:23:59,236
I lost my fiancé last year.

244
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:04,122
And I know we were trained
to compartmentalise

245
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:08,042
things that hurt too much,

246
00:24:08,131 --> 00:24:11,298
but I still haven't been able to do that.

247
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,797
And as hard as it is, I...

248
00:24:15,889 --> 00:24:20,182
I would rather feel it
than to not feel anything.

249
00:24:29,778 --> 00:24:31,569
Hey.

250
00:24:52,342 --> 00:24:54,002
Oh...

251
00:24:57,013 --> 00:24:58,638
I'm sorry.

252
00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:07,729
Agent Bristow?
Agent Lennox?

253
00:25:13,488 --> 00:25:17,023
- What's going on?
- Back up against the wall.

254
00:25:17,117 --> 00:25:18,575
- What is this?
- Why?

255
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,902
- What...
- What are you doing?

256
00:25:25,542 --> 00:25:27,415
- All right, stay down.
- Lennox. Lennox.

257
00:25:27,502 --> 00:25:28,961
Stay down.
Sydney, go.

258
00:25:29,045 --> 00:25:30,290
- Hey, hey.
- Sydney, go.

259
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,542
- OK.
- Stay down.

260
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:34,300
Go, go. Sydney, go.

261
00:25:39,722 --> 00:25:43,637
OK, take it easy.
Take it easy. What is it?

262
00:25:43,726 --> 00:25:46,680
He's gonna be placed
in federal custody.

263
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,101
What's going on?

264
00:25:55,196 --> 00:25:58,696
We've decrypted the specs on Project
Helix that you and Vaughn obtained.

265
00:25:58,783 --> 00:26:01,784
The data describes a breakthrough
in next-generation molecular gene therapy.

266
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:06,247
It refers to a new procedure whereby
a patient's face and body are reshaped

267
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:08,658
to identically resemble someone else.

268
00:26:08,751 --> 00:26:13,045
Agent Lennox was
the first test subject to be doubled.

269
00:26:13,131 --> 00:26:16,001
- Doubled how? Like cloning?
- Not exactly.

270
00:26:16,092 --> 00:26:19,461
So you're saying the man
that we rescued isn't Agent Lennox?

271
00:26:19,554 --> 00:26:21,463
- It's possible.
- So who is he?

272
00:26:21,556 --> 00:26:23,964
Based on our intel
the procedure's first recipient

273
00:26:24,058 --> 00:26:28,187
was the man who created
the technology - Dr Markovic.

274
00:26:29,647 --> 00:26:33,099
There is no way the man we have
in custody is Dr Markovic.

275
00:26:33,193 --> 00:26:37,273
I know it sounds insane. But as
we were analysing the news footage,

276
00:26:37,363 --> 00:26:41,029
Phillips noticed the interference of an RF
signal, which helped narrow our search.

277
00:26:41,117 --> 00:26:44,533
We got this from a traffic camera.

278
00:27:05,642 --> 00:27:08,761
Over the last few years,
it's become common practice

279
00:27:08,853 --> 00:27:11,890
for wanted terrorists
to employ men who look like them.

280
00:27:11,981 --> 00:27:15,148
Decoys designed
to mislead intelligence agencies.

281
00:27:15,235 --> 00:27:17,476
With this new procedure,
that would no longer be necessary.

282
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,939
Men like Osama Bin Laden could simply
be made to look like someone else.

283
00:27:21,032 --> 00:27:25,196
Clearly, that is not something we can afford
to have advertised on the black market.

284
00:27:25,286 --> 00:27:27,612
How is this possible
without obvious scarring?

285
00:27:27,705 --> 00:27:28,868
The procedure isn't surgical.

286
00:27:28,957 --> 00:27:33,749
The patient's genetic code is altered
to reshape their physical attributes.

287
00:27:33,837 --> 00:27:35,829
- Is it reversible?
- It's unclear.

288
00:27:35,922 --> 00:27:39,421
It only works on people
of a certain genetic disposition,

289
00:27:39,509 --> 00:27:42,794
and the recipient must be induced
into a comatose state for several days

290
00:27:42,887 --> 00:27:44,714
while their cells regenerate.

291
00:27:44,806 --> 00:27:48,424
The data indicates the only way to
distinguish the real person from the double

292
00:27:48,518 --> 00:27:50,142
is by an ocular scan.

293
00:27:50,228 --> 00:27:54,771
A flaw in the iris was deliberately built
into the procedure to tell them apart.

294
00:27:54,858 --> 00:27:57,146
Even if Lennox is who he says he is,

295
00:27:57,235 --> 00:28:01,612
there is no real way of guaranteeing
that he's not the man in that video.

296
00:28:01,698 --> 00:28:08,744
I'm telling you, the man we rescued just
had his life destroyed. He's on our side.

297
00:28:20,341 --> 00:28:22,583
He is who he says he is.

298
00:28:22,677 --> 00:28:25,250
What the hell do you mean,
I've been doubled?

299
00:28:25,346 --> 00:28:28,466
- The project you were investigating.
- Project Helix, what about it?

300
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:31,227
- A prototype surgical gene resequencer.
- All right, meaning what?

301
00:28:31,311 --> 00:28:35,771
Markovic created a technique that allows
people to change their appearance.

302
00:28:35,857 --> 00:28:40,318
That's why we gave you the ocular scan -
to make sure that you were really you.

303
00:28:40,403 --> 00:28:44,483
Do we know who it was?
The man who took my identity?

304
00:28:46,951 --> 00:28:49,158
Dr Markovic.

305
00:28:52,332 --> 00:28:56,164
Now I know why Emma
didn't call for an extraction.

306
00:28:57,212 --> 00:28:59,418
She had no idea I was captured.

307
00:29:02,425 --> 00:29:07,764
We had a hotel room in Berlin.
She thought she was with me.

308
00:29:13,186 --> 00:29:16,769
Markovic had the Helix prototype
taken off Cayo Concha.

309
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:20,724
- We tracked it to a freight yard in Poland.
- He's trying to hide it.

310
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:22,479
What's the next move?

311
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:26,734
I've been ordered to find the prototype,
download the schematics, then destroy it.

312
00:29:26,825 --> 00:29:28,782
I'm coming with you.

313
00:29:57,272 --> 00:30:00,023
This is Mountaineer.
We're in position in the train yard.

314
00:30:00,108 --> 00:30:04,485
Copy, Mountaineer, we've got you
on satellite. We're reading five guards.

315
00:30:05,071 --> 00:30:09,116
One on the north side of track two.

316
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,905
One between tracks one and two.

317
00:30:19,127 --> 00:30:23,077
Two on the southern perimeter.
One on top of the centre car.

318
00:30:30,221 --> 00:30:33,970
Wait, we just lost the last guard.
Hold while we reacquire his signal.

319
00:31:09,928 --> 00:31:12,253
Do you have the drill?

320
00:31:12,347 --> 00:31:14,220
Drill.

321
00:31:21,356 --> 00:31:23,929
All right, I'm having trouble
seeing the third tumbler.

322
00:31:24,025 --> 00:31:28,604
- OK, the borescope's jammed, hang on.
- Do you have the audio?

323
00:31:34,994 --> 00:31:37,616
All right, here we go.

324
00:31:37,705 --> 00:31:39,698
All right, all right, all right.

325
00:31:42,752 --> 00:31:45,587
- We got it.
- OK.

326
00:31:55,265 --> 00:31:57,969
I'm gonna rig the explosives.

327
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,387
All right, Boot Camp,
I'm into the data log.

328
00:32:04,482 --> 00:32:07,898
Copy that. Standing by
to receive the schematics.

329
00:32:13,741 --> 00:32:19,696
All right, wait a second. According to
this, the sequencer's been used twice.

330
00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:21,034
What?

331
00:32:21,124 --> 00:32:24,659
I'm not the only one
who's been doubled.

332
00:32:25,837 --> 00:32:27,913
Who else?

333
00:32:30,008 --> 00:32:32,250
It doesn't say.

334
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:48,188
Agent Vaughn. A call was routed through
the PBX you need to take right away.

335
00:32:48,276 --> 00:32:50,849
- Who am I talking to?
- My name is James Lennox.

336
00:32:50,945 --> 00:32:53,780
The man you rescued
is Dr Renzo Markovic.

337
00:32:53,865 --> 00:32:56,071
I know that sounds impossible.

338
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,326
He's developed some kind
of genetic doubling prototype.

339
00:32:59,412 --> 00:33:01,571
- We know.
- I was captured trying to infiltrate

340
00:33:01,664 --> 00:33:04,334
his medical lab on Concha Cayo.

341
00:33:04,417 --> 00:33:08,545
They knew the CIA would send in a team
after me and they set you up.

342
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:13,292
I just escaped 12 hours ago while they
were trying to transport me off the island.

343
00:33:13,384 --> 00:33:16,006
- Where are you now?
- I'm in Poland.

344
00:33:16,095 --> 00:33:19,595
I've tracked the prototype
to a freight yard here. I'm gonna destroy it.

345
00:33:19,682 --> 00:33:23,846
I got him. He's two miles away
and travelling alone.

346
00:33:24,562 --> 00:33:26,270
It could be Markovic.
A guard may have alerted him

347
00:33:26,356 --> 00:33:28,763
and he's now trying to prevent us
from sabotaging the prototype.

348
00:33:28,858 --> 00:33:30,139
There's no way to be certain.

349
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:33,730
I'd like to believe you, but we conducted
a test confirming Lennox's identity.

350
00:33:33,822 --> 00:33:36,573
The ocular scan?
The ocular scan doesn't work.

351
00:33:36,658 --> 00:33:40,323
That was disinformation he wanted you
to download, so you would trust him.

352
00:33:40,411 --> 00:33:42,321
The ocular scan is a joke.

353
00:33:42,413 --> 00:33:44,905
Listen carefully:
do not approach the train yard.

354
00:33:44,999 --> 00:33:48,451
I'm losing you.
Hello? I can't hear you.

355
00:33:48,962 --> 00:33:52,247
Hello? I'm losing you. Hello?

356
00:34:15,572 --> 00:34:18,193
Put me through to Sydney on a separate
channel. I only want her to hear this.

357
00:34:18,283 --> 00:34:20,655
Got it.

358
00:34:20,743 --> 00:34:25,951
Sydney, don't react, just listen. Do not
take your eyes off the man you're with.

359
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,908
We just got a call from someone claiming
to be the real Agent Lennox.

360
00:34:30,003 --> 00:34:32,576
He's on his way to you now
and it looks like he's alone.

361
00:34:32,672 --> 00:34:36,337
Clear your throat if you copy.

362
00:34:38,386 --> 00:34:41,304
Backup copy.

363
00:34:44,517 --> 00:34:47,518
Sydney, there's no way for us
to verify the identity of either man.

364
00:34:47,604 --> 00:34:49,312
Disarm the man you're with,
then take cover

365
00:34:49,397 --> 00:34:51,556
so you can do the same
to the man heading your way.

366
00:34:51,649 --> 00:34:54,567
Once they're both secured,
lead them to the extraction point.

367
00:34:54,652 --> 00:34:57,737
We'll figure this out
when they're in custody.

368
00:34:57,822 --> 00:35:00,444
Don't move.

369
00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:05,370
What are you doing, Sydney?

370
00:35:09,793 --> 00:35:13,956
Against the wall, on your knees,
hands behind your head.

371
00:35:16,674 --> 00:35:19,545
Put your hands behind your head.

372
00:35:19,636 --> 00:35:21,712
On your knees.

373
00:35:24,349 --> 00:35:26,341
He's secure.
How far away is the other man?

374
00:35:26,434 --> 00:35:29,969
What other man?
You think I'm Markovic.

375
00:35:30,063 --> 00:35:33,313
Cloud cover's moved in over your position.
We're blind, but he's gotta be right there.

376
00:35:33,399 --> 00:35:36,235
- Sydney, Sydney, you have to trust me.
- Cuff yourself to the rail.

377
00:35:36,319 --> 00:35:40,447
All right. If someone is headed this way
claiming to be me, it's Markovic. All right?

378
00:35:40,532 --> 00:35:43,651
- I'm telling you, he is setting us up.
- Then why's he travelling alone?

379
00:35:43,743 --> 00:35:47,326
Because he knows if our satellite picks up
a security team headed this way,

380
00:35:47,413 --> 00:35:49,490
we won't hesitate
to destroy the prototype.

381
00:35:49,582 --> 00:35:51,789
All right, it is his only play
to get his face back.

382
00:35:51,876 --> 00:35:54,546
Sydney, he killed Emma.
He will kill you.

383
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:13,260
Hold it.
Drop the gun and turn around.

384
00:36:20,488 --> 00:36:22,944
You don't work for Markovic.
You're CIA.

385
00:36:23,032 --> 00:36:27,493
- I'm Jim Lennox. I'm CIA too.
- Drop the gun. Drop the gun, now.

386
00:36:34,752 --> 00:36:37,706
- Put the gun down.
- Markovic's men are on their way here.

387
00:36:37,797 --> 00:36:41,047
Drop it or I'll shoot.

388
00:36:41,134 --> 00:36:43,459
We have to trust each other.

389
00:36:45,555 --> 00:36:47,133
Get down.

390
00:36:50,769 --> 00:36:51,266
Sydney?

391
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:31,009
- Drop it.
- You son of a bitch.

392
00:37:31,101 --> 00:37:34,386
- He's lying. He has to say that.
- I was tortured for four weeks.

393
00:37:34,479 --> 00:37:36,602
- He knows enough to pass as me.
- Don't listen. He took my life.

394
00:37:36,689 --> 00:37:39,263
You're not walking out of here.

395
00:37:40,985 --> 00:37:44,437
Neither of you can drop your guns.

396
00:37:52,163 --> 00:37:54,737
What are you doing?

397
00:37:56,668 --> 00:38:00,084
I hope you like your face,
Dr Markovic.

398
00:38:01,756 --> 00:38:05,125
You're gonna have it for a long time.

399
00:38:07,595 --> 00:38:09,173
Don't!

400
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:13,946
Yeah, all right.
Appreciate it.

401
00:39:15,163 --> 00:39:17,535
Four weeks off.
The least they could do.

402
00:39:17,624 --> 00:39:23,080
Yeah, well, they offered me counselling,
but I haven't not worked in eight years.

403
00:39:24,923 --> 00:39:26,999
Where are you headed?

404
00:39:27,091 --> 00:39:30,792
Fiji. I've never been there before.

405
00:39:30,887 --> 00:39:34,090
Emma and I were gonna go
for our honeymoon.

406
00:39:34,933 --> 00:39:37,056
She was from there.

407
00:39:37,143 --> 00:39:39,302
I know.

408
00:39:40,021 --> 00:39:42,642
I knew her.

409
00:39:42,732 --> 00:39:45,223
You knew Emma?

410
00:39:47,529 --> 00:39:51,028
One thing about my fiancé.

411
00:39:53,993 --> 00:39:57,659
I was lucky to have known him
for as long as I did.

412
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,497
Thank you.

413
00:40:30,029 --> 00:40:33,979
Where do we go?
Nobody knows

414
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:43,623
I've got to say I'm on my way down

415
00:40:45,211 --> 00:40:49,161
God give me style and give me grace

416
00:40:52,802 --> 00:40:58,841
God put a smile upon my face

417
00:41:15,575 --> 00:41:19,703
Where do we go to draw the line?

418
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:28,409
I've got to say I wasted all your time

419
00:41:28,505 --> 00:41:30,711
Oh, honey, honey

420
00:41:30,799 --> 00:41:32,756
Where do I go...

421
00:41:32,842 --> 00:41:35,001
You're so beautiful.

422
00:41:35,094 --> 00:41:37,171
Dinner's ready.

423
00:41:38,014 --> 00:41:41,513
We do have an oven, you know.
We can reheat.

424
00:41:42,644 --> 00:41:44,601
Yeah

425
00:41:44,687 --> 00:41:47,724
And ah

426
00:41:47,816 --> 00:41:53,936
When you work it out
I'm worse than you

427
00:41:54,030 --> 00:42:01,408
Yeah, when you work it out I wanted to

428
00:42:01,496 --> 00:42:08,911
And ah, when you work out
where to draw the line

429
00:42:09,003 --> 00:42:16,880
Your guess is as good as mine

430
00:42:31,484 --> 00:42:35,482
Where do we go?
Nobody knows
