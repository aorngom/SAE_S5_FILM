1
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:06,252
OK. I'm in.

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:09,293
Agent Bristow works undercover
with her father, Jack Bristow,

3
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,211
also a double agent with CIA.

4
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:12,501
Get down.

5
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:14,884
We'll have to learn to trust each other.

6
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:17,262
Bristow's CIA contact: Michael Vaughn.

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,224
My guardian angel.

8
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:24,019
Her current assignment:
to infiltrate and destroy SD-6,

9
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:27,440
a secret organisation
dealing in espionage, extortion,

10
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,603
weapon sales, posing as the CIA.

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,697
SD-6 has made over $400 million
in arms sales alone.

12
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:38,864
The sanctity of this agency requires
the sacrifice of some personal freedoms.

13
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:43,582
This is not about cutting off an arm of the
monster. This is about killing the monster.

14
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:46,539
Bristow's mother:
formerly Russian intelligence,

15
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:49,417
recently turned herself in to the CIA.

16
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:51,132
Mom?

17
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:56,508
Intel indicates she may still be
an enemy of the United States.

18
00:00:56,598 --> 00:01:01,426
The true loyalty of Agent Bristow's mother
remains unknown.

19
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,717
Previously on <i>Alias:</i>

20
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:06,596
The only way SD-6 will let you live
is if you destroy the life you've got.

21
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:10,143
If you don't go public with this,
you'll be a dead man.

22
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,443
I'm scared.

23
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,606
I know.

24
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,487
You ready?

25
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,798
Are you suggesting that I kill my wife?

26
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:40,151
Yeah? On my way.

27
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:55,133
I'm Assistant Director Kendall.
I'm told you want to cooperate.

28
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,890
Hey, Mr Bristow. Come on in.

29
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,972
Let me ask you a question.

30
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:11,017
Let's say you're hanging out
at your favourite neighbourhood restaurant,

31
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,515
with some friends...

32
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:19,730
Or whatever. You like to go there. You like
the food. What colour are the walls?

33
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,903
I'm not really into interior decorating.

34
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,074
I'll get Syd.

35
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,924
Syd, your dad's here.

36
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,498
OK. I'll be right out.

37
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,886
You know, to the Vietnamese and Chinese,

38
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:48,842
the colour white means death
and bad fortune.

39
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,596
- Try red.
- Really?

40
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,397
Hi.

41
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,851
Will's sentencing is at two.
I'll meet you there?

42
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,273
Yeah.

43
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:03,488
Did you hear about Will? The story
he made up? He was high the whole time.

44
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,949
Yes. I saw that on the news.
Unfortunate.

45
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,528
You know what I wanna do to the guy
who introduced Will to heroin?

46
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,165
I wanna kill him.

47
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,330
- With my hands. I just wanna kill him.
- I can imagine.

48
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:18,964
I'll see you at the courthouse.
And I'm gonna go buy some red paint.

49
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:28,972
I thought you'd wanna know -
your mother's transfer is complete.

50
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,476
She's being held at
a joint task force facility downtown.

51
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:37,226
The idea that the CIA is willing
to work with Irina Derevko is insane.

52
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,311
Worse - it's naive.

53
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:44,908
Your mother didn't just conveniently turn
herself in. This is all part of a manipulation.

54
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:48,362
Well, she's their problem now.
She's not yours.

55
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,993
She's not mine.

56
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,582
You OK?

57
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,875
My shoulder's healing,
if that's what you mean.

58
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,503
It's not, actually.

59
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,674
Thanks for asking. I'm fine.

60
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,483
I don't support the death penalty,

61
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:22,067
but I hope that she dies
for all that she's done.

62
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,646
I really do.

63
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:38,253
Arvin Sloane is a man
of integrity and courage.

64
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:43,166
As the head of SD-6,
he brilliantly executed Alliance policy -

65
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:49,129
helping to slowly and invisibly
seize control of world markets,

66
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:52,344
governments and technology.

67
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,804
Now, as the newest
full partner of the Alliance,

68
00:05:55,897 --> 00:06:03,193
I feel confident that he will play a major part
in shaping that policy for years to come.

69
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:11,534
I speak for everyone when I offer you my
condolences on the passing of your wife.

70
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:13,452
Thank you.

71
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:18,996
We respect and admire your willingness
to do what was necessary in that matter.

72
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:24,382
You have been made aware
of the initiation procedure?

73
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,294
I have.

74
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,221
- And the reasons for it?
- Yes.

75
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,563
Welcome to the Alliance.

76
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:45,862
Sloane got back from London last night
a full partner of the Alliance.

77
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:51,072
Emily knew the truth. Her death,
his immediately being let in?

78
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:54,826
I am convinced
he killed his wife to get that seat.

79
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,584
Killing his wife wouldn't surprise me.
Eating his wife wouldn't surprise me.

80
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,337
SD-6 and the Alliance believe
that my mother is in hiding

81
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,128
and they know that Khasinau's dead,

82
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,832
and they are correct to assume that what's
left of her organisation is vulnerable.

83
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,713
The Alliance wants whatever assets
they can get their hands on.

84
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:15,767
- So where are they starting?
- My mother used blackmail extensively.

85
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:21,143
In running her operation, she would get
dirt on people - powerful important people -

86
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:24,186
and coerce them
into doing whatever she needed.

87
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,317
Pornographic photographs,

88
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:30,983
illegally obtained audio files, names, dates
- they're all on one computer disc.

89
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,819
So what does the Alliance want? The dirt?

90
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:37,039
To hear Sloane tell it,
it's all about God and country.

91
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,910
It is our obligation to do whatever we can
to retrieve the disc.

92
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:43,584
Now, what you're looking at
is the El Sebkba Hotel in Rabat.

93
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:48,049
A Derevko operative named Mohammed
Naj lives and works out of the fourth floor.

94
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,423
Early last week the blackmail disc
in question was taken

95
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,054
to a vault at that location.

96
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:57,215
The operation is simple - break into
the vault, retrieve the disc.

97
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,550
My flight's at six.

98
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,052
Well, we'll make contact
with a countermission no later than three.

99
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,143
OK.

100
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,267
- How's Weiss?
- He's still in the hospital.

101
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:11,438
But the doctors say he's gonna be OK,
and until then, I've gotta feed his fish.

102
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:14,403
Yeah? Yes. Let him through.

103
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,738
- It's Kendall.
- What does he want?

104
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,205
- I don't know.
- I don't trust him.

105
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,949
- We have to hear him out.
- Hear him out? He arrested me.

106
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,706
- He's in control of operation.
- He thought I was the devil.

107
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:24,874
Mr Vaughn, Agent Bristow.

108
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,338
Did you clear this meeting through Devlin?

109
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,249
No. I'm sorry.

110
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,630
I don't have time to go through channels.

111
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,292
There's been an interesting development
regarding your mother.

112
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:37,220
As you know she surrendered to the CIA
and claims to want to cooperate.

113
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:40,594
So she's handed over her agency's
operations manual - the Bible?

114
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:45,148
No. And she won't talk about it.
She won't talk to us about anything.

115
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,309
Then as far as I'm concerned
that's the end of the story.

116
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,691
Well, that's the interesting development.

117
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:53,777
It seems that the only person
she's willing to talk to is you.

118
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,868
- Then you're outta luck.
- I'm afraid you're gonna have to talk to her.

119
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,574
- Excuse me, you can't compel Agent...
- That's exactly what I can do.

120
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,364
Are we through?

121
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:04,537
I don't have to remind you that this is
a matter of national security, do I?

122
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,703
Yeah, we're through.

123
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:10,082
I'll wait to hear from you.

124
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,429
Just so we're clear, Mr Vaughn.

125
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:22,019
I know all about your participation in
busting Bristow out of federal custody.

126
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,514
Convince her to talk to her mother

127
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:29,228
or face charges for obstructing justice
and harbouring a fugitive.

128
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:33,399
Guess it's two-for-one day on blackmail.

129
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:12,024
So, Mr Tippin, do you understand what
you're being accused of here today?

130
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:15,646
- Yes, Your Honour, I do.
- Felony charge of heroin possession.

131
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,192
Misdemeanour count of being under
the influence of a controlled substance.

132
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,073
- How are you pleading?
- Guilty.

133
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,535
Under Proposition 36,
you are to receive probation,

134
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,752
and are hereby ordered to complete
a certified drug treatment programme.

135
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:32,786
In addition, you must complete
100 hours of community service.

136
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:37,425
Fail to meet any of these requirements
and you will serve time.

137
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:38,757
It's a subvocal mike.

138
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,682
With it we can hear what's going on
between you and Dixon at all times.

139
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:46,013
And as soon as you can, I want you to go
radio silent with him so you and I can talk.

140
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,061
- Call waiting for spies.
- Yeah.

141
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:51,848
Now, the blackmail disc is
in a safe in Naj's suite on the fourth floor.

142
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:55,193
As soon as you get it, you'll deliver it
to this man - Richard Schmidt.

143
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,771
He's working under a diplomatic cover
at the Rabat embassy.

144
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,902
He'll be waiting for you on the third floor.

145
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:05,122
Now, Sloane is obviously looking for
something specific. We don't know what.

146
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,365
Schmidt will scan the disc,
analyse what's on it,

147
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:11,456
and spit up a bogus copy that's close
enough to the original to fool Sloane.

148
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:14,630
That's the disc you'll deliver to SD-6.

149
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,590
OK.

150
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,550
Or...

151
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:25,469
you could ask your mother
about the contents of the disc.

152
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:33,812
Kendall must really be putting on
the pressure for you to ask me that.

153
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:39,738
Yeah. He is. But I've been thinking about it
myself. Sydney, you're good at this.

154
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,576
I mean, this is what you're trained for.
Compartmentalising your emotions -

155
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,867
you do it on every mission,
you do it with Sloane.

156
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,706
This isn't the same.

157
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:54,793
Syd, I would never force you to do this.
I would never make this an official request.

158
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:58,879
But I also know that what you want
more than anything is to destroy SD-6

159
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:03,013
and bring an end to the Alliance, and if
she can help us, then why not use her?

160
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:06,383
Because I can't.

161
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,682
Because I won't.

162
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:14,265
Maybe you could shut down with her,
I couldn't.

163
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,444
I'll talk to you from Rabat.

164
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:26,448
I spoke with Agent Bristow and she has
no intention of speaking with her mother.

165
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,447
- Mr Vaughn...
- Yes, sir, I know, it's unacceptable.

166
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,367
Let me remind you you're asking
a woman to go face to face...

167
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,210
- You don't need to remind me of anything.
- With the woman who abandoned Sydney.

168
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,287
I know the story and I know
that you have your own issues...

169
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,871
- I have issues with her. So should you.
- I've read the reports.

170
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,587
- Mr Kendall, Irina Derevko shot Sydney.
- Yes, she shot Sydney.

171
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,136
Point-blank range.
She could have killed her.

172
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,052
But didn't kill her. Did not.

173
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:53,813
That woman, 48 hours ago, was 100 per
cent pure bad news, but now she's ours.

174
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:58,893
And there is just a chance, Mr Vaughn,
that she has turned.

175
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:05,234
When she got done with my father,

176
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:09,739
he could only be identified
by his dental records.

177
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:16,035
Yes. Nevertheless, she headed up
an organisation that controlled people

178
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:20,506
who influence policy decisions
at NATO, the UN, the World Bank.

179
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:24,590
Even with all our resources, the CIA
doesn't know the scope of her operation -

180
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,301
the key players, their methods,
acquisitions, ambition.

181
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,724
I can get her to talk.

182
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,226
I don't want you to ask Sydney
to see her ever again.

183
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,351
Well, I'm not gonna make that promise.

184
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,732
You're not the easiest guy to work with,
are you?

185
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,442
No. No, definitely not.

186
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,970
- I have a 20 on Naj and his bodyguard.
- OK, I'm coming in.

187
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,973
OK, Syd. We're on.

188
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:16,928
- Syd, you close?
- I'm right behind you.

189
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:33,284
- You know, you always do that.
- What?

190
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,374
What you just did with your hair.
It's your thing.

191
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:40,243
- I don't have a thing.
- It is. It's your thing.

192
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,841
If the rest of the hotel is like this,
<i>sarà perfetto. </i>

193
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:53,259
- And how may I help you?
- My name is Beatrice Cunelli.

194
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:56,934
<i>Mio marito</i> Silvio and I
are in town for three months,

195
00:14:57,022 --> 00:15:02,264
while I recover from a <i>ridiculo</i> jet skiing
accident off the coast of Majorca.

196
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,488
Presidente Travel Agency
booked us into the Derrahm,

197
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,657
which turns out to be
<i>totalmente inaccetabile. </i>

198
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:14,950
Now that I see this, I call Silvio and tell him
"Bring the bags right over."

199
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,617
Your bags?

200
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:20,159
<i>Comunque,</i> we were at
a cocktail party last night,

201
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:24,630
and the consul general says
that he simply raves about this place.

202
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:28,167
Naturally, I called
and booked a suite <i>immediamente. </i>

203
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:33,884
There must be some mistake,
mademoiselle. We are completely full.

204
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:37,593
Do me a favour, darling.
Check for me.

205
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,851
Beatrice Cunelli.

206
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:45,024
Yes. Of course.
But I'm pretty sure it's...

207
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:51,151
- Reservation for Mr and Mrs Cunelli.
- I hope it's a room with a view.

208
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,954
All right, Dixon, I've got the key
to Naj's suite. I'm on my way.

209
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:59,012
We're interested in a computer disc
containing information used for blackmail.

210
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:02,720
We believe you're familiar with this item.

211
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:15,406
That's an implied question. I'll make it clear
for you. Are you familiar with this item?

212
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:30,465
I know you wanna see your daughter. I can
guarantee you that is never gonna happen

213
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,839
unless she knows you're cooperating.

214
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:36,379
Prove yourself.
Give Sydney a reason to see you.

215
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,549
Sydney?

216
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,807
Interesting.

217
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:48,602
Agent Bristow is in Rabat now,
seeking to recover the list.

218
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,315
Is there anything she should know?

219
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,775
Next to the safe there's a fire alarm.

220
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:04,244
If you wanna protect her,
tell her to pull it first, then open the safe.

221
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:06,042
Why?

222
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:11,628
I've given you a gift,
and all you get from me is one.

223
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:18,295
You look just like him.

224
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:28,063
I'm through with the prisoner.

225
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:55,168
To find the safe, you're gonna need this.

226
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,047
Now, it looks like just
a normal metal detector.

227
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,973
Well, it is. That's right.
We're going old school on this one.

228
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:08,689
Now, the safe is a Walderson. It's an
original. The craftsmanship is incredible,

229
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:11,099
which, lucky for you,
the same can be said about this.

230
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:14,442
You know those stethoscopes that outlaws
would use to rob banks back in the...

231
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,403
You know, with the horses
and the guns and the ca...

232
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:21,282
Well, I studied how those worked,
being a bit of an outlaw myself.

233
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,528
Basically, this -
superamplified version of that.

234
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:29,078
Now, you just place this over the dial -
this part right here - and you type in 793.

235
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:32,502
793. That spells "Syd",
in case you forget. 793.

236
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:35,162
Cos on a phone the numbers
and the letters... You know that.

237
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:39,470
And, basically, this will do the rest for you.

238
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,554
- I need to talk to Agent Bristow.
- She's now radio silent.

239
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,266
If we try and communicate
her SD-6 partner could hear us.

240
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:52,310
And if we don't,
she might trigger the alarm.

241
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:55,274
The locking mechanism is a set of wheels.

242
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,568
The trick is to line up each notch
on these wheels with contact points.

243
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:01,867
Now, once each notch is lined up,
part of the combination will appear.

244
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,621
Now, when they all line up,
the lock will open.

245
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:08,536
- We're almost there. Going radio silent.
- Just be careful.

246
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,411
- Now.
- Freelancer. This is Boot Camp.

247
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:12,708
- Do you copy?
- Go ahead, Boot Camp.

248
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:15,465
Sydney, do not open the safe.

249
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:19,214
- What?
- Is there a fire alarm on the wall?

250
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:25,006
- Yes.
- OK. Listen to me. It's a fail-safe.

251
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,469
Do not open the safe
until after you pull the alarm.

252
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,479
We had no intel on a fail-safe.
Where'd you get this information?

253
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,055
Vaughn spoke with your mother.
The intel came from her.

254
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,810
It's her disc, she's familiar with the vault.

255
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,903
If there's a fail-safe,
only she's gonna know.

256
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,906
And what if there's not?
I'm just supposed to pull the fire alarm?

257
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,613
Sydney, I know this sounds crazy,
but I think it's for real.

258
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:46,825
Vaughn, she wants me dead.

259
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,748
If that were true, Agent Bristow,
she would have killed you in Barcelona.

260
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,493
Did you talk to my father about this?

261
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,870
Two minutes ago on the phone while we
were waiting for you to go radio silent.

262
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:57,205
- What did he say?
- Your dad?

263
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,789
- The answer is no.
- All I'm asking is that you consider it.

264
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,676
- Consider the source.
- I don't need to be lectured.

265
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,383
- This woman is not to be trusted.
- Jack, listen to me.

266
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,928
In no circumstances discuss this
with my daughter.

267
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:10,717
I don't think your father can think clearly
where your mother's concerned.

268
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:13,220
- And you can?
- I'm trying.

269
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,106
She has nothing to gain by lying.

270
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,896
Miss Bristow, I want you
to pull that fire alarm.

271
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:28,950
Sydney.

272
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,116
I'd do it.

273
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:44,178
Agent Bristow, pull that alarm.

274
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:03,522
See what I mean?

275
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:15,451
Dixon, I've tripped some kind of alarm.
What do you see?

276
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:20,333
Naj and his bodyguard are on their way up.

277
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:23,590
Just look for the disc.
I'll handle Naj.

278
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:52,321
This is Freelancer.
I've got the blackmail disc.

279
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:53,742
What's your position, Freelancer?

280
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:56,323
- Leaving the suite. Heading for the stairs.
- On my way.

281
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:58,790
We got it.

282
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:08,054
Do you have it?

283
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:11,505
- Syd, do you have the disc?
- Yes.

284
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,473
OK.

285
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:19,181
- What happened? Did you get it?
- Negative.

286
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:24,149
- What?
- I repeat: the disc was not transferred.

287
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:29,323
The satellite feed is up.
Sloane wants the information asap.

288
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,485
Good job, Syd.

289
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:40,623
Alain? Arvin.

290
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:47,507
Yeah. I thought you should know that SD-6
is in possession of the blackmail disc.

291
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:50,548
Thank you.
And more good news.

292
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,927
You know that gentleman we discussed?

293
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:55,174
Peter Fordson.

294
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:58,851
Well, we now have information on him.

295
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:02,390
Photographs.

296
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:04,144
No.

297
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:06,477
Of his daughter.

298
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:11,482
Apparently, he's willing to pay a high price
to keep them private.

299
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:14,862
Well, if you saw them, you'd know why.

300
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:19,409
I leave for Helsinki tonight.

301
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:22,074
I'm seeing Fordson myself.

302
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:27,006
I wanna talk to my mother.

303
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:30,508
I hate her. I don't understand her.
I think she's a monster.

304
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:33,762
But if she can help us bring an end
to SD-6, then what I think is irrelevant.

305
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:35,888
I'm not so sure.

306
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,351
- What?
- I've been thinking about it.

307
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:39,511
- I'm not certain that's a good idea.
- Is this about my father?

308
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:42,391
- He has a point.
- He can't think clearly about her.

309
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:43,264
That woman has an agenda.

310
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:44,982
- I screwed up.
- I wouldn't be so quick to trust her.

311
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:46,692
- We don't know what she's after.
- If I'd listened to her,

312
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:48,569
we'd have the disc right now.

313
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:52,190
All I know is she offered good intel
and I didn't choose to use it.

314
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:55,652
Now SD-6 has the blackmail disc.
We don't know what they want with it,

315
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:58,782
but they've got it now and we don't,
and it's my fault.

316
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:01,495
I know I'm the one who tried
to convince you to see your mother,

317
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:04,918
to be unemotional with her.

318
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:10,675
I thought I could do it, see her,
and be as cold-blooded as she is.

319
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:15,045
It's hard to explain what it feels like...

320
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,637
sitting across from her.

321
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:25,396
What she did to my family,
to my father.

322
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:30,311
But she's your mother, Sydney.
With all she's done, she is your mother.

323
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:36,443
Vaughn, if you're worried about me...

324
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:41,446
you don't need to be.

325
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:59,258
I called you in to say thank you.

326
00:25:59,351 --> 00:26:02,387
We now have the disc,
and it's because of you.

327
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:04,518
What was on it?

328
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:07,975
Horrible things.
Private moments.

329
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:13,691
The disc is a collection, a physical
manifestation, of human weakness.

330
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:16,355
A tool that some people...

331
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:22,162
that your mother used
to extract favours from those in power.

332
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:27,623
Which, Sydney, is something
that I wanted to talk to you about.

333
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:31,922
Your mother.

334
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:36,710
- What about her?
- You saw her in Taipei?

335
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:39,722
Yes.

336
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:42,559
Well, I just...

337
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:50,185
I just wanted to remind you that
I am here for you, if you ever need to talk.

338
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:54,815
Thank you.

339
00:26:58,493 --> 00:27:00,865
I wanted to cut off my hand.

340
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:02,946
Did he say anything else
about the blackmail disc?

341
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,704
- Why the Alliance wanted it?
- No. I thought you'd have seen it.

342
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:10,838
No. Sloane sent the disc
to Alliance headquarters in London.

343
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:15,631
I'll see if I can find out whatever was on
the disc and why it was so important.

344
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:18,292
How are you going to do that?

345
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:22,339
I'll ask Mom.

346
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,761
- You've agreed to see her.
- Yes.

347
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:31,521
- Sydney, she is the enemy.
- And so is Sloane.

348
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:34,776
And if the devil herself wants to help me
bring him down, fine by me.

349
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:36,986
She has never been interested
in helping you.

350
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:38,698
- She told me to pull the alarm.
- Yes.

351
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:42,033
And for all you know
that could have made things worse.

352
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,489
Sydney, you're smarter than this.

353
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:48,785
Your mother wants you
to think she's your ally,

354
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:52,328
that she can you help get what you want.
Her intel might even be accurate.

355
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:54,711
Once. Twice.

356
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:01,471
But the minute you start depending on her,
she will gut you.

357
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:18,276
Will, what happened to your face?

358
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:21,531
You know the one thing they don't tell you
about doing community service?

359
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:24,821
- Sun block.
- Oh, buddy. How'd it go?

360
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:27,368
Hanging out with a bunch
of fellow drug addicts?

361
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:31,668
Picking up copies of the newspaper
I used to write for with a stick? Not good.

362
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:37,791
Oh, I saw you at the gas station over on
National with some guy. Like, dark suit, 50.

363
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:44,052
- That was the liquor licence guy.
- What? Wait a minute. Like a Mafia guy?

364
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,014
- Yeah, kinda.
- Francie?

365
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:48,473
It's gonna take six months
to get a legitimate liquor licence.

366
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:50,601
So you're hanging out
with the Gambino crime family

367
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:52,147
and you're giving me grief
about doing drugs?

368
00:28:52,232 --> 00:28:54,224
- It's so not the same thing.
- No, it's not.

369
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:56,476
You're involved with organised crime.
It's totally different.

370
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,776
You have no idea what it takes
to start a restaurant.

371
00:28:58,863 --> 00:29:02,149
I have to deal with contractors
and subcontractors and...

372
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:04,318
I know. I know.
I used to work at the Metro desk.

373
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:06,617
I wrote, like, two dozen pieces
on restaurants -

374
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:08,863
Health Department, ratings,
code requirements...

375
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:10,784
I just need a liquor licence.

376
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:13,366
I know, what you need is someone
who knows how the system works,

377
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:16,213
someone who can help you navigate.

378
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:20,378
What you need is me -
you know, former drug addict reporter.

379
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:23,588
And sometimes lobster impersonator.

380
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:27,173
I'll help you out.

381
00:29:28,351 --> 00:29:30,260
To get to the facility
where your mother is being held,

382
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:34,433
you'll go through a secret entrance. Start
at the southwest corner of Riverside Park.

383
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:37,893
Head east until you pass a homeless man
sitting in front of a statue.

384
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:42,197
He'll have a sign indicating he's a Vietnam
vet. He'll have a cup. Drop a coin in it.

385
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:45,947
Freelancer requests covert entry.

386
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:51,366
- Copy that. Routing her in.
- At Riverside turn left.

387
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:56,796
The traffic cameras will identify if you're
being visually or electronically tracked.

388
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:06,418
In the underpass beneath the 134 there's
an emergency phone. It's out of order.

389
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:09,349
If it's ringing,
you've been cleared of all surveillance.

390
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:13,301
This is a series of three-digit codes.
Memorise them. They rotate weekly.

391
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:16,481
After the phone rings,
enter the appropriate code.

392
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:18,772
In front of you there's
an industrial shipping container.

393
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,778
On the backside, a door will unlock.

394
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:27,114
You'll go down a steep set of stairs
through a series of checkpoints,

395
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:31,069
and a quarter mile later
you'll be at the operations centre.

396
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:39,870
Agent Bristow? Vicki Crane.

397
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:42,040
Right this way.

398
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:48,464
Mr Kendall.

399
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:52,048
Glad you changed your mind.

400
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:11,429
You didn't pull the alarm.

401
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:27,403
I wouldn't have pulled it either.

402
00:32:32,285 --> 00:32:36,235
We need to know
who and what is on the disc.

403
00:32:41,086 --> 00:32:42,959
How's your shoulder?

404
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:47,876
- The disc?
- Peter Fordson.

405
00:32:48,677 --> 00:32:50,799
- Who?
- Peter Fordson.

406
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:56,094
He has a file on the disc.
He's the man SD-6 will go after first.

407
00:32:57,811 --> 00:32:59,684
Why?

408
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:04,063
- One step at a time.
- I need to know why.

409
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:07,685
No. You want to know why.
There is a difference.

410
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:10,566
Go after Fordson.
Trust me.

411
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:15,578
Why should I do that?

412
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:20,249
Because I'm your mother.

413
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:48,274
Here's what we know about Fordson.
He's based in Helsinki.

414
00:33:48,361 --> 00:33:50,318
A year ago his company contracted
with the Pentagon

415
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:53,192
to manufacture a terahertz wave camera.

416
00:33:53,283 --> 00:33:56,403
Put in a satellite
they can see into NORAD undetected.

417
00:33:56,494 --> 00:33:58,202
Last month Fordson failed
to make delivery,

418
00:33:58,288 --> 00:33:59,782
complaining of production problems.

419
00:33:59,873 --> 00:34:03,573
Or produced the camera just fine
but planned on delivering it to your mother.

420
00:34:03,668 --> 00:34:05,328
So SD-6 wanted that disc

421
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,911
so they could blackmail Fordson
into giving them the camera.

422
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:11,256
Phillips, get the floor plans for the
Lasgrove building. Any intel we've got.

423
00:34:11,343 --> 00:34:14,712
Crane, I want a meeting
on op tech in one hour.

424
00:34:14,804 --> 00:34:19,715
You're going to Helsinki.
You're gonna get that camera.

425
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:24,060
He's got great bedside manner, huh?

426
00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:36,402
The guards will be changing shifts
in two minutes.

427
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:38,201
You should be in the lab
by the time they leave

428
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:42,035
and have five minutes
before they get back.

429
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:52,840
How could I forget the wonderful things
that keep me amused?

430
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:59,928
How could I forget
to worship you each day?

431
00:35:01,393 --> 00:35:05,437
I remember somewhere in my soul

432
00:35:05,522 --> 00:35:08,273
Syd, Sloane's here.

433
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:14,525
- He's after the camera too.
- You wanna call off the op?

434
00:35:14,614 --> 00:35:17,650
No. We go for it.

435
00:35:17,742 --> 00:35:21,076
- Are you sure?
- I just need a minute.

436
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:25,371
Mr Fordson. Arvin Sloane.

437
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:27,866
You Americans are persistent.

438
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:31,460
I'm telling you on the phone our company's
not looking for new partners,

439
00:35:31,548 --> 00:35:33,671
and still you come all this way.

440
00:35:33,758 --> 00:35:37,008
- Syd, you ready?
- The handbrake won't lock into place.

441
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:41,045
Why don't we talk about it
on the balcony? Shall we?

442
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:44,682
Syd, he is headed right towards you.

443
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:47,343
- I'm not ready yet.
- Well, you better get ready.

444
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,648
Syd, he's gonna see you.

445
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:09,205
I'm good. Thanks.

446
00:36:18,261 --> 00:36:20,835
I'm at 14.

447
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:25,011
- Where's Sloane?
- With Fordson, putting on the squeeze.

448
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:29,724
- This is your proposal?
- No.

449
00:36:29,814 --> 00:36:36,316
My proposal is that we go downstairs,
that you give me your T-wave camera

450
00:36:36,404 --> 00:36:40,272
and that I keep your daughter's
depravations our secret.

451
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:44,949
Derevko's gone.
You work for me now.

452
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:47,529
Let's not waste time.

453
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:30,705
Sloane just left.
I repeat: he is on his way.

454
00:38:03,241 --> 00:38:05,317
Found it.

455
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:09,365
Syd, only four more floors to go.

456
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:13,083
Got it.

457
00:38:13,168 --> 00:38:16,003
Meet me at the extraction point.

458
00:39:00,423 --> 00:39:02,499
Let's go.

459
00:39:08,014 --> 00:39:11,099
This is where it was.
I'm telling you.

460
00:39:11,184 --> 00:39:14,683
Well, if it's not here, it's somewhere.

461
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:18,389
I don't know.
I swear to God, I don't know.

462
00:39:24,114 --> 00:39:26,439
Just think about it.

463
00:39:28,118 --> 00:39:30,359
Where could it be?

464
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:42,085
'Twas in another lifetime

465
00:39:42,173 --> 00:39:44,083
One of toil and blood

466
00:39:44,175 --> 00:39:48,636
When blackness was a virtue
and the road was full of mud

467
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:53,015
I came in from the wilderness,
a creature void of form

468
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:55,972
"Come in" she said
"I'll give you shelter from..."

469
00:39:56,062 --> 00:40:00,724
We're on the same side.
It's time you started acting like it.

470
00:40:06,448 --> 00:40:08,689
Agent Bristow. Hi.

471
00:40:08,783 --> 00:40:11,405
We had a briefing with Derevko
about T-wave technology,

472
00:40:11,494 --> 00:40:13,119
what she knows about how it works.

473
00:40:13,204 --> 00:40:15,612
Two hours, and your mother
didn't say a single word.

474
00:40:15,707 --> 00:40:19,621
- It's Vicki, right?
- Yeah. With an <i>i</i> - at the end.

475
00:40:20,086 --> 00:40:22,708
Vicki, I'm tired and I wanna go home.

476
00:40:23,673 --> 00:40:25,796
I don't mean to be rude
but if there's nothing else...

477
00:40:25,884 --> 00:40:28,209
Oh, no. I'm sorry.
There isn't, no.

478
00:40:28,303 --> 00:40:31,304
Except the one she did ask was

479
00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:35,553
if someone would pass along
her congratulations to you.

480
00:40:35,643 --> 00:40:40,638
She seemed really proud.
I hope you get some rest.

481
00:40:41,191 --> 00:40:46,185
"Come in" she said
"I'll give you shelter from the storm"

482
00:40:54,788 --> 00:40:58,832
I was burned out from exhaustion,
buried in the hail

483
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:01,490
I wanna see the prisoner.

484
00:41:04,214 --> 00:41:07,583
Hunted like a crocodile,
ravaged in the corn

485
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:13,337
"Come in" she said
"I'll give you shelter from the storm"

486
00:41:20,939 --> 00:41:24,771
Suddenly I turned around
and she was standing there

487
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:29,945
Let's get something clear.
You are not my mother.

488
00:41:31,908 --> 00:41:34,743
My mother was Laura Bristow.

489
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:39,039
Laura Bristow died in a car accident
21 years ago.

490
00:41:39,124 --> 00:41:45,127
You are a traitor and a prisoner
of the United States Government.

491
00:41:45,672 --> 00:41:47,748
Look at me.

492
00:41:51,845 --> 00:41:54,964
We will interact only when necessary.

493
00:41:55,056 --> 00:41:58,805
You will address me as Agent Bristow
and answer only the questions I ask.

494
00:41:58,893 --> 00:42:03,105
There will be no personal anecdotes,
no comments about my job performance,

495
00:42:03,189 --> 00:42:07,567
no condolences or congratulations.

496
00:42:09,612 --> 00:42:12,697
Do you understand me?

497
00:42:18,246 --> 00:42:20,951
Do you understand?

498
00:42:22,792 --> 00:42:24,666
Yes...

499
00:42:25,837 --> 00:42:28,245
Agent Bristow.

500
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:41,761
I've heard newborn babies
wailing like a mourning dove

501
00:42:41,853 --> 00:42:45,851
And old men with broken teeth
stranded without love

502
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:50,437
Do I understand your question, man,
is it hopeless and forlorn?

503
00:42:50,528 --> 00:42:55,523
"Come in" she said
"I'll give you shelter from the storm"
