1
00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:06,210
OK, I'm in.

2
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:09,215
Agent Bristow works undercover
with her father Jack Bristow,

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,008
also a double agent with CIA.

4
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,422
Get down.

5
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,801
I guess we'll just have
to learn to trust each other.

6
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:17,178
Bristow's CIA contact: Michael Vaughn.

7
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,141
My guardian angel.

8
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:23,806
Her current assignment:
to infiltrate and destroy SD-6,

9
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:27,314
a secret organisation
dealing in espionage, extortion,

10
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,608
weapon sales, posing as the CIA.

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,697
SD-6 has made over $400 million
in arms sales alone.

12
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:38,739
The sanctity of this agency requires
the sacrifice of some personal freedoms.

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:43,409
This is not about cutting off an arm of the
monster. This is about killing the monster.

14
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:46,455
Bristow's mother:
formerly Russian intelligence,

15
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,298
recently turned herself in to the CIA.

16
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,960
Mom?

17
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:56,341
Intel indicates she may still be
an enemy of the United States.

18
00:00:56,431 --> 00:01:01,223
The true loyalty of Agent Bristow's
mother remains unknown.

19
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,390
Previously on <i>Alias:</i>

20
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,428
- I'm Mr Sark, director of operations.
- Who is your employer?

21
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:11,732
I'm afraid my employer's identity
will have to remain confidential for now.

22
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:16,448
Tell your employer if he ever
wastes my time like this again,

23
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:20,235
our next meeting will not be so cordial.

24
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,164
Under Proposition 36,
you are to receive probation,

25
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:30,836
and are hereby ordered to complete
a certified drug-treatment programme.

26
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,838
Arvin Sloane is a man
of integrity and courage.

27
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:39,257
As the head of SD-6,
he brilliantly executed Alliance policy.

28
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:42,848
Now, as the newest
full partner of the Alliance,

29
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:48,226
I feel confident that he will play
a major part in shaping that policy.

30
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,641
Welcome to the Alliance.

31
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,362
- You've agreed to see her?
- Yes.

32
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,449
- She is the enemy.
- And so is Sloane.

33
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,785
And if the devil herself wants to help me
bring him down, fine by me.

34
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:06,747
You're smarter than this. Your mother
wants you to think she's your ally.

35
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:11,627
The minute you start depending on her,
she will gut you.

36
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,521
Freelancer requests covert entry.

37
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:33,356
That's a copy. Will notify Agent Vaughn.

38
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,735
No one's following.

39
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:41,275
Ident confirmed.
Freelancer is approaching quadrant four.

40
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:45,319
SIGINT reporting clear,
no suspect signals.

41
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:56,216
Agent Bristow, thank you for coming in.

42
00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:00,339
I know you weren't wild about
talking with your mother last week, but

43
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,178
I hope we can agree that the information
she gave us made it worth your discomfort.

44
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,972
I thought so, until an hour ago.

45
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:11,228
- How was that?
- I just came from a meeting with Sloane.

46
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:14,934
The camera I took from Fordson's vault,
the camera we tried to keep from SD-6,

47
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,522
was an early prototype.

48
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:20,657
The real camera is scheduled to be
launched into orbit 72 hours from now.

49
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,236
By whom?

50
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:26,740
The Asiatic Space Agency,
founded after the fall of the Iron Curtain.

51
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:30,247
The ASA consists mainly
of displaced Russian scientists.

52
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:34,167
Their latest client is an old friend of ours.

53
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,129
Sark.

54
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,376
What's his interest in launching a satellite?

55
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,012
That's the question.

56
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,504
The satellite is equipped with
a terahertz imaging camera.

57
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,893
This camera is capable of seeing through
solid matter up to a depth of 100 metres.

58
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:53,475
It is imperative that we find out
what Mr Sark is looking for.

59
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,725
The launch site's in Sri Lanka.

60
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,357
Sloane wants us to infiltrate it,
posing as corporate buyers.

61
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,273
Our mission is to hack into the satellite

62
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,200
so SD-6 can tap into Sark's feed
and see what he sees.

63
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:06,488
I'll get technical services on that.
We'll want to hack into that feed, too.

64
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,908
A fine preliminary step, Agent Vaughn,

65
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:13,502
but I will want to know what we're
looking for before the satellite is launched.

66
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,963
You want me to talk to her again.

67
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,256
Mr Sark has assumed control
of your mother's operation...

68
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,374
Please stop referring to her as my mother.

69
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,960
Therefore, Ms Derevko must know
what he's looking for.

70
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,086
She's made it clear
she will only speak with you.

71
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,139
Look, I talked to her before
because I had to.

72
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,218
I have no intention of
making this into a habit.

73
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,146
I assume you have
an opinion on this, Agent Vaughn?

74
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:39,152
- I don't have an easy answer to that.
- I'll take a complicated one.

75
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,604
I can't pretend to hide my bias here.

76
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:47,693
Irina Derevko betrayed this country
and killed my father in the process.

77
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,574
On the other hand,
she is a certifiable Rambaldi expert,

78
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,915
and probably knows more about the
inner workings of global organised crime

79
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,754
than any other person in US custody.

80
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:03,876
Having said that, I believe Agent Bristow
and I were effectively countering SD-6

81
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:10,388
before Derevko turned herself in,
and I stand behind whatever she decides.

82
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:18,019
I do understand that you're caught
in the middle of all this, Agent Bristow.

83
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,435
I can only offer my word.
The sooner we know what she knows,

84
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:24,147
the sooner you'll never
have to speak with her again.

85
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,902
We weren't scheduled to meet until
Wednesday. Is everything all right?

86
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:34,457
- I'm here to talk about Sydney.
- Good. What's on your mind?

87
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:40,163
I want your help in devising a strategy

88
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:43,957
to persuade Sydney
not to interact with her mother.

89
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:44,668
Why?

90
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:49,174
Because Irina Derevko is an
opportunistic sociopath, who will use

91
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:53,643
whatever inroads she can make
with my daughter to get what she wants.

92
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,563
But have you considered that
the more you keep her from her mother,

93
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,221
the more you're going
to spark her interest?

94
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,191
Of course I have,

95
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:05,655
which is why I'm hoping to devise
a strategy with the necessary subtlety.

96
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:13,737
Well, I'm sorry, but I am not in the habit of
helping a father manipulate his daughter,

97
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,786
no matter how good his intentions may be.

98
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,952
I see.

99
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:24,793
And is your opinion here based on
what's best for Sydney or for the agency?

100
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:29,546
Because the fact is, if Sydney doesn't
talk to Laura, the CIA learns nothing.

101
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,891
So you still think of her as Laura,
even though that was her alias?

102
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,791
Autocircadian meditation.

103
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:06,379
All the benefits of sleep
in a fraction of the time.

104
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,885
I can teach it to you, Sydney.

105
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:15,096
I told you, when we speak
you are to address me as Agent Bristow.

106
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:21,605
Mr Sark was one of your top operatives.
He's now assumed control of your assets.

107
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,770
He's launching a satellite

108
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,899
with ground-penetrating
surveillance capabilities,

109
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:29,565
but I doubt this is news to you.
What's he looking for?

110
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:41,870
Do you remember when you were six
years old and I sent you to piano lessons?

111
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,921
Your teacher was Ms Adams.

112
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,252
We are not having this conversation.

113
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:51,628
You asked me a question.
I'm giving you an answer.

114
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:57,226
Do you remember the first thing
Ms Adams taught you about music?

115
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:05,515
She said "Music is like math."

116
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,018
"If you can count, you can play."

117
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:12,322
Every musical note has
a corresponding frequency -

118
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:15,575
middle C, for example,
vibrates at 261 hertz -

119
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:19,362
which means any piece of music
can be expressed as a series of numbers.

120
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:25,163
Sark is looking for a music box designed
by Rambaldi. The box plays a unique tune.

121
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,497
Encoded within the tune
there's an equation.

122
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,627
- For what?
- Zero point energy.

123
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:37,053
A fuel source. The military applications
alone would be unlimited.

124
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,719
From a music box?

125
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,345
Of course, the music won't play
without the proper combination.

126
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:47,729
Sark was working on deciphering it, but
I don't know whether he was successful.

127
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,652
Fine. Thank you.

128
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,651
Speaking of Ms Adams.

129
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:01,282
Just before I left,
I remember her encouraging you

130
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,957
to try out for your school's
Thanksgiving play.

131
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,127
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to,

132
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:15,637
but in the 20 years since I last saw you,
I've often wondered,

133
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,093
what part did you play?

134
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,224
I don't remember.

135
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,485
That was around the time
I was told my mother had died.

136
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,647
Everything else is a blur.

137
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:19,784
I read Vaughn's debrief.
I know you saw your mother. You OK?

138
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,410
Seeing her again,

139
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:30,461
I'm realising there are these gaps in
my memory from around the time she left.

140
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:36,048
Dad, do you remember a Thanksgiving
play I was in that year in school?

141
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,920
Because I sorta do. I mean,
I have an impression of it, but...

142
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:44,059
I can't remember,
was I a pilgrim, or an Indian?

143
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:48,560
What?

144
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,017
You were neither.

145
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,687
You were a turkey.

146
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:00,193
You were the only turkey
that was spared to celebrate the harvest.

147
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:12,494
I know you think it's dangerous for me
to see Mom, but she's a means to an end.

148
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,416
I don't take anything
she says at face value.

149
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,177
She won't expect you to.

150
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,336
Sydney...

151
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,728
I trust your judgement.

152
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,057
You're doing fine.

153
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:38,439
OK, once you get through
the launch site to the exhaust ducts,

154
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,735
just press this button right here

155
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,448
and voilà.

156
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,405
- It's empty.
- Oh, yeah, sorry, I totally forgot to tell you.

157
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,332
The real deal, not done yet, but tomorrow,
when you open up this briefcase,

158
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,667
you will be looking at
a high-performance hydraulic luge.

159
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,336
How fast can I go?

160
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,502
About 150, which should get you through

161
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:04,593
the launch facility's two-mile ducts
in about 12 seconds.

162
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:07,008
Oh, you wanna make sure that you
get out of there as fast as you can

163
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:09,806
after you're done wiring
the circuit board into the satellite

164
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:16,349
because if you're stuck in the ducts when
the rocket launches, then, well, boom.

165
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,694
Then I'd miss you.

166
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,652
- You wanted to see me?
- Come in.

167
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,618
I have something to give you.

168
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,960
That's Emily's seed box.

169
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:41,584
The lithography's original, circa 1910.

170
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:46,921
Her mother gave it to her.
Emily would have wanted you to have it.

171
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,181
Thank you.

172
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:54,556
I can't think of Emily
without thinking of her garden.

173
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,725
Well, neither can I.

174
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,574
I miss her, too.

175
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:08,609
This office is where I feel
most at home these days.

176
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:13,166
At the house...
I don't know, I seem to be paralysed.

177
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:18,293
If a stranger were to come
to the house for the first time,

178
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:21,584
they would think that Emily still lived there.

179
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:25,756
Her clothes are in the closet,
her makeup on the vanity.

180
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:29,845
The only thing that betrays
this pretence of normalcy is her garden.

181
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:33,101
Where roses once grew, they're gone now.

182
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:36,473
Her garden seems to have died with her.

183
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,519
It's not your fault.

184
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,295
Good luck in Sri Lanka.

185
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:05,835
Attach this circuit board to the satellite
instead of the one you got from SD-6.

186
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:09,879
Now, it's an exact duplicate.
They'll still be able to intercept Sark's feed,

187
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,596
but we've modified it
so we can access the signal, too,

188
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:14,808
see what everyone else is seeing.

189
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:20,566
One more thing. We'd like to bring
Will Tippin in for a follow-up on his debrief.

190
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:21,850
Why?

191
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:25,029
Derevko told us that Sark has been
working on cracking a combination

192
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:27,321
- that would activate the music box.
- Yeah?

193
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:30,160
And we've been reviewing
Tippin's statement, and he reported

194
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:32,321
falling in and out of consciousness
on the flight to Taipei

195
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:34,952
and vaguely remembers
seeing Sark working at a laptop.

196
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,868
You're thinking what?
Induced regression?

197
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,584
We have someone
coming in from Langley.

198
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,247
So he can relive
everything he went through?

199
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:44,003
If there were another option,
Sydney, believe me, I'd take it.

200
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,963
Listen, Will, the CIA
wants to meet with you again.

201
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:51,300
- Why?
- They can tell you better than I can, but...

202
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:55,929
- Here's your SOP.
- SOP?

203
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:58,262
Standard Operating Procedure for a meet.

204
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:01,523
- You're meeting with my handler.
- Vaughn.

205
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:07,114
He's smart, professional.
Won't waste your time.

206
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:12,987
Look, I'm sorry.
You deserve to move on from this.

207
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:15,539
Hey, guys.

208
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,699
Hey.

209
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,371
- What are you doing?
- What?

210
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:23,918
Will just went to his first NA meeting
and you're waving a beer in his face?

211
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,462
- You're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

212
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:29,256
Can you come down to the restaurant
tomorrow? I could really use you.

213
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:29,926
Sure.

214
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:31,887
All the flatware came in and
the dishwasher's not hooked up,

215
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:35,010
so we have to wash everything by hand
before the opening. You're coming, right?

216
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,845
- Are you kidding?
- What time do you need me?

217
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,688
- Two, two-thirty?
- I gotta go. I'm gonna miss my flight.

218
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:43,557
- Fancy client or boring seminar?
- Boring client, and he's in Sri Lanka.

219
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:47,186
So we get to fly 15 hours both directions
for a one-hour meeting.

220
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,444
Hey, thanks for letting me stay
till I can afford a cheaper place.

221
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:54,921
OK, Syd. Sark's confirmed inside.
You're a go.

222
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:57,758
Remember, the sooner
you get on the phone line,

223
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:00,472
the more time I have
to hack into their system.

224
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:06,604
Joanna Kelly from Euro-Teledyne.
I have an appointment with Mr Vashko.

225
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,314
Mr Sark, welcome to our control centre.

226
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:11,977
Will you be the only observer
from your company today?

227
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:15,276
I'm afraid my associates are preparing
to lobby OPEC for drilling rights.

228
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,073
We are about to begin
the final system checks.

229
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:19,194
Excellent.

230
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:30,590
Ms Kelley,
welcome to ASA's launch facility.

231
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:33,462
Thank you. I look forward to the tour.

232
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,593
Would you mind if I made a call
before we start?

233
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,930
I'm sorry, we do not allow
mobile phone use during the launch.

234
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:41,093
It interferes with the radio signals,

235
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:44,222
but you're more than welcome
to use one of our land lines.

236
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:46,805
Thank you.

237
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:56,065
Hi, darling. Just checking in.

238
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:58,401
OK, I'm into their local area network.

239
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:01,282
It'll take me a minute to access
the security surveillance feed.

240
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,908
OK, I'm in.

241
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,784
Miss you, too. Kisses.

242
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:11,498
And in compliance with
Kyoto environmental accords,

243
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:15,803
during launch we filter the rocket's
exhaust through two-mile ducts.

244
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:20,763
I understand these ducts are capable of
channelling over a million pounds of thrust.

245
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,306
You have done your homework.

246
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:27,143
I will take you to the VIP observation deck.

247
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:30,521
The view is spectacular.

248
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:39,398
My watch seems to have stopped.
Do you have the time?

249
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:40,774
Oh, sure.

250
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,780
OK, Dixon.
I'll be in the canal in two minutes.

251
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:50,791
Copy that, Syd. Ready to cut
the surveillance feed on your signal.

252
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,624
Radio frequency system, check.

253
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:54,625
Activation of vehicle telemetry, check.

254
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:56,176
On-board power test, check.

255
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:58,966
Radar transponder and launch vehicle
remote control, check.

256
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,826
- OK, Dixon, I'm in position.
- Copy that, Syd.

257
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,703
The ground crew's left the launch deck.

258
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:09,703
I'm shutting down surveillance
for five minutes, starting now.

259
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:16,256
We've lost CCTV to the launch deck.

260
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:30,516
- What's the problem?
- I'll know shortly.

261
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,791
Dixon, how am I doing?

262
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:54,375
Three minutes, ten seconds
until surveillance is restored, Syd.

263
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,876
Power surge.
We'll be back online in three minutes.

264
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:02,965
I assure you, this in no way
indicates a problem with the launch.

265
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:05,510
Is there any way onto the launch zone
that isn't visible from here?

266
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,390
Just the exhaust ducts,

267
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:12,718
but our ground crews don't go
anywhere near them during countdown.

268
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,768
- Move up the launch.
- Pardon?

269
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:19,691
I'm splicing into the internal
supply system now. Almost there.

270
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,021
You said yourself
the cameras don't affect the launch.

271
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,440
Technically they don't, but if something
were to go wrong, we'd want to study...

272
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:26,776
Then begin the final countdown.

273
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,906
Or should we abort altogether? I could
spread the word amongst my colleagues

274
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:35,502
that the Asiatic Space Agency is nothing
but the poor man's version of NASA.

275
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:44,676
Initiate the final countdown.
We're advancing our timetable.

276
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:49,639
Sydney, get out of there.
They've moved up the launch.

277
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:02,019
Dixon, I'm still wiring the circuit board.
How much time do I have?

278
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,821
48 seconds and counting.

279
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:05,021
Switching to internal power.

280
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:06,397
Transferring control to on-board computer.

281
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:07,903
Tank pressurisation to launch...

282
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:12,407
Sydney, it's too dangerous. Abort.
We're at 44 seconds and counting.

283
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:15,203
- Syd, get outta there.
- No, I got it.

284
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:20,756
All systems green for launch in 30, 29,

285
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,414
28, 27...

286
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:38,765
Three, two...

287
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:53,664
Sydney.

288
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:02,830
I'm all right.

289
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:08,220
I'll meet you at the rendezvous
in ten minutes.

290
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:22,766
- Did you enjoy the launch?
- It was a thrill.

291
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:59,595
- Will, I'm Michael Vaughn.
- Hey.

292
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:01,349
Sorry about the cloak-and-dagger routine,

293
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:03,517
but SD-6 may monitor you
from time to time.

294
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,855
We had to make sure you weren't followed.

295
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,020
Sure, I get it.

296
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:10,445
- So, you're Vaughn?
- You sound surprised.

297
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:14,448
No, I just thought you'd be, uh, older.

298
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:16,495
Ah.

299
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:19,368
Listen, we want to bring you in
for a hypnotherapy session.

300
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:22,994
From your statement, we think you might
be able to recall details from your captivity

301
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:25,923
that could help us.

302
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:28,000
- When?
- There's a car waiting for us upstairs.

303
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:30,050
Now?

304
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:32,806
You know, I can't. I'm helping
my friend get a restaurant ready.

305
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:34,965
Francie.

306
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,890
Right.

307
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,054
So, tomorrow, then?

308
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:42,439
Sure, OK.

309
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:44,647
OK, you'll get a call on your cellphone
from a telemarketer,

310
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:46,941
asking if you're interested
in consolidating your debt.

311
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:53,991
That will be your signal to meet back here.
We'll have a car take you to our office.

312
00:24:55,995 --> 00:25:01,120
So, every time that Sydney ran out the door
after she got a wrong number,

313
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:03,617
- she was going to meet you?
- It's standard protocol.

314
00:25:03,712 --> 00:25:09,335
In case the line's tapped.
It's a low-risk way to set up a meet.

315
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:13,801
Did you ever give her a picture frame?
It was like an antique.

316
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:17,340
She said that it was
from somebody at work and...

317
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:20,933
It was probably just another way
to contact her, right?

318
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:24,021
Actually, no, that was just a gift.

319
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:34,482
- It's nice to meet you, Will.
- You, too.

320
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:39,704
Congratulations are in order to both of you.
Thanks to your efforts in Sri Lanka,

321
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:45,413
we were able to intercept the feed from the
satellite launched by Mr Sark yesterday.

322
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:50,379
He's looking at a 20-square-mile
area of Siberia. Marshall.

323
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:55,757
Right. Now, I know this looks like
20 miles of frozen tundrosity, right?

324
00:25:55,847 --> 00:26:00,805
Well, take a look at it
through the terahertz imaging camera.

325
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:03,888
The symbol of Rambaldi.

326
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:09,603
Yeah, now, what the satellite's looking at
are subglacial caverns, under the ice.

327
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:12,648
- Are you saying it's a natural formation?
- Well, it beats me.

328
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:18,078
Without actual ice core samples, I can't
say anything except, you know, wow.

329
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:21,281
You are now looking at an image
with a ten-centimetre resolution.

330
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:24,824
And as you can see, in the centre of
the cavern, there appears to be an object,

331
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:26,827
notably composed of metal.

332
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,704
We must acquire this object
before Mr Sark does.

333
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,669
So, you will be accompanied
by a support team.

334
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,333
They will establish a perimeter
with Agent Dixon

335
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:39,929
to guard every possible
entrance to the cavern.

336
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:44,096
Sydney, you're on point.
The flight leaves in four hours.

337
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:47,105
That's all. You can go.

338
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:50,567
Jack, would you stay a minute, please?

339
00:26:58,326 --> 00:27:01,244
I want to ask you for a favour, Jack.

340
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:08,033
I think I may have underestimated the
effect that Emily's death would have on me.

341
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:09,622
You're entitled to your grief.

342
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:15,169
Not when it undermines my authority here,
my standing within the Alliance.

343
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,921
I need you to monitor me, Jack.

344
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:25,887
I need you to pull me aside,
if you think that I'm letting my cards show.

345
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,306
Of course.

346
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:35,896
The day before she...

347
00:27:41,536 --> 00:27:44,027
The day before she passed,
Emily reserved us a suite

348
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:47,954
at our favourite bed and breakfast
in Sonoma.

349
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:54,296
Even in her last moments,
she was planning our future.

350
00:27:57,677 --> 00:27:59,753
I'm not a spiritual man.

351
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:08,971
But I feel lately her presence
everywhere around me.

352
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:15,189
Trauma can bring about feelings
of metaphysical familiarity.

353
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:17,686
Waking dreams, as it were.

354
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:21,861
On the other hand,
who is to say she isn't with you?

355
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:31,501
I'm going to count backwards
from three, and when I reach one,

356
00:28:31,586 --> 00:28:35,584
I want you to lift your head
and tell me where you are.

357
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:39,837
Three. Two. One.

358
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:46,091
Where are you?

359
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:55,646
I'm in a cargo plane,
on the way to Taipei.

360
00:28:55,735 --> 00:29:00,943
- Will, how are you feeling?
- I'm afraid they're gonna kill me.

361
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,821
I'm afraid they're gonna get to Sydney.

362
00:29:04,911 --> 00:29:08,991
They can't, Will.
You're revisiting what's already happened.

363
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:12,914
This is just a memory.
Now tell me what you see.

364
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:20,545
Sark, working on his laptop.

365
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:22,295
Can you see the screen?

366
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,885
No.

367
00:29:27,726 --> 00:29:29,350
It's too far away.

368
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:33,765
In his statement, he said that he was
picked up and carried off the plane.

369
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:35,933
So maybe he got closer.

370
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:43,981
Will, listen to me. I want you to think ahead
to when the plane landed.

371
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:48,536
When you were getting off the plane.
Can you do that?

372
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:49,653
Yes.

373
00:29:49,748 --> 00:29:52,203
What do you see?

374
00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:58,417
Oh, God, they're coming to get me.
Please. Please, please don't kill me.

375
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:00,131
Please don't kill me.

376
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:03,004
- Wake him up.
- It's all right.

377
00:30:03,094 --> 00:30:07,092
- Don't kill me. Please don't kill me.
- Will, tell me what's happening.

378
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:11,262
- They're carrying me off the plane.
- Can you see Sark's computer?

379
00:30:11,353 --> 00:30:15,931
- No. No, I'm passing too fast.
- Go back and try again.

380
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:21,149
This time, when you pass the computer,
I want you to stop.

381
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:29,570
Names. I see names.

382
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:31,406
Read them to me.

383
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:35,250
Dostoyevsky.

384
00:30:36,294 --> 00:30:38,619
Nabokov.

385
00:30:38,713 --> 00:30:40,789
Tolstoy.

386
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,748
Chekov.

387
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:51,008
That's good, Will.

388
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:54,683
Now, when you hear the tone,
I want you to open your eyes.

389
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:59,516
And as soon as you do,
you will feel rested and refreshed.

390
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:03,192
I need to check his vitals.
Just give me a minute.

391
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:14,955
You OK?

392
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:19,205
I doubt the code that activates Rambaldi's
music box is a list of Russian authors.

393
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:22,332
It must be some kind of cipher text.

394
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:27,465
Look, under normal circumstances,
I would never ask this.

395
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:30,389
But your mother is the only person
who can translate those names for us

396
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:32,015
by the time you leave.

397
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,935
If your mother will give us the code
to activate the music box,

398
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,012
we want you to activate the box on-site.

399
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:40,474
You'll get it to play and we'll record
the music through your comlink.

400
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:43,687
- Then you'll destroy it.
- Agent Bristow?

401
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:06,842
Dostoyevsky, Nabokov, Tolstoy, Chekov.

402
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:10,011
We took these code words
from Sark's computer.

403
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:15,339
- I want you to translate them for me.
- Give me your pencil and paper.

404
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:16,514
No.

405
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:20,553
I can't decipher it without pencil and paper.

406
00:32:52,889 --> 00:32:59,259
You know, you haven't yet asked me
how I could shoot my own daughter.

407
00:32:59,354 --> 00:33:01,477
No, I haven't.

408
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:13,568
I assume you wouldn't need
this combination so urgently

409
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:17,278
if you didn't know
where the music box was.

410
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,287
Sark won't hesitate to kill you.

411
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:29,882
And I don't wanna lose the chance
to explain myself someday.

412
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:46,263
About the Thanksgiving play.

413
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:50,355
I was a turkey.

414
00:33:58,204 --> 00:33:59,580
Thank you.

415
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:42,533
I'm not reading any inbound contact.

416
00:34:42,624 --> 00:34:44,782
It looks good. We're all alone out here.

417
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:47,628
But keep your motion trackers on,
and stay sharp.

418
00:34:47,712 --> 00:34:51,959
Novak, you're guarding the southeast
entrance. Cooper, you guard the north.

419
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,089
Stay on station.

420
00:34:54,177 --> 00:34:59,800
Watch your step. If you fall through the ice,
it'll freeze over in four seconds.

421
00:34:59,891 --> 00:35:01,967
Good to know.

422
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:33,587
Yeah?

423
00:35:33,675 --> 00:35:36,166
Hello? Hello?

424
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:50,355
- Yes, sir?
- Would you get me security section?

425
00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:52,933
I need a back-trace on a call I just received.

426
00:35:53,028 --> 00:35:55,104
Just a moment.

427
00:35:57,907 --> 00:36:00,944
Sir, the call came from
the Barranca bed and breakfast

428
00:36:01,036 --> 00:36:03,740
in Sonoma County, California.

429
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:12,084
Report contact.

430
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:15,173
Position one holding.
Negative on contacts.

431
00:36:15,258 --> 00:36:19,635
Position two holding. No contacts.
I'm all alone out here.

432
00:36:19,721 --> 00:36:22,010
Syd, how do you copy in there?

433
00:36:24,476 --> 00:36:26,552
Gotcha five-by, Dixon.

434
00:37:06,851 --> 00:37:09,010
Dixon, the ice in this tunnel
looks a little shaky.

435
00:37:09,104 --> 00:37:10,930
I'm gonna go radio silent
till I pass through.

436
00:37:11,022 --> 00:37:13,976
Copy that. Standing by.

437
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:53,764
I've had a picture of your face
in my mind for 20 years.

438
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:59,100
I remember a loving husband.

439
00:38:00,655 --> 00:38:02,980
A generous man.

440
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:05,114
A patriot.

441
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:12,326
I may have been under orders
to fabricate a life with you,

442
00:38:13,168 --> 00:38:19,917
but there were times when the illusion
of our marriage was as powerful for me

443
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:22,214
as it was for you.

444
00:38:23,345 --> 00:38:26,262
Especially when Sydney was born.

445
00:38:28,975 --> 00:38:32,510
Looking at you now,

446
00:38:32,604 --> 00:38:36,815
I see that illusion is finally gone.

447
00:38:41,154 --> 00:38:44,523
I want to make something very clear to you.

448
00:38:45,575 --> 00:38:50,403
There are people here who believe you can
repay the debt you owe this country

449
00:38:50,497 --> 00:38:53,830
through your continued cooperation.

450
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:57,742
I am not one of them.

451
00:38:57,837 --> 00:39:05,548
And if Sydney in any way becomes
victim to your endgame, I will kill you.

452
00:39:06,054 --> 00:39:09,387
She's spent most of her life
believing you were dead.

453
00:39:09,474 --> 00:39:16,093
She'll get used to it again, no matter
what bond you try to forge with her.

454
00:39:22,195 --> 00:39:28,233
You haven't told her what you did
to her after I disappeared, have you?

455
00:39:52,142 --> 00:39:54,715
Base Ops, this is Freelancer.
Do you copy?

456
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:57,219
Read you loud and clear, Freelancer.

457
00:39:57,313 --> 00:40:00,065
I've found the music box.

458
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:06,154
It looks intact. Stand by. I'm gonna enter
the code my mother gave me.

459
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:12,076
Cooper. Novak.
I've got an inbound contact.

460
00:40:12,162 --> 00:40:14,949
Northwest, 100 metres.
Can you confirm?

461
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,531
- Got 'em on radar.
- Ditto.

462
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:22,542
- But I don't see anyone.
- The target has stopped.

463
00:40:23,798 --> 00:40:24,878
Correction.

464
00:40:24,966 --> 00:40:30,340
Reading four, four tangos,
approaching from all directions.

465
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,968
- They're heading for the entrance.
- I still don't see anyone.

466
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:36,890
Sydney, do you copy?

467
00:40:36,978 --> 00:40:38,057
Sydney.

468
00:40:38,146 --> 00:40:42,523
Three, one, one.
Two, five, four.

469
00:40:52,535 --> 00:40:54,611
We've got audio.

470
00:40:57,749 --> 00:41:00,916
Talk to me, Cooper.
Your tango is ten metres away.

471
00:41:01,002 --> 00:41:03,672
- I don't see anything.
- It's right on top of you.

472
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:07,338
I'm telling you, I'm all alone out here.

473
00:41:07,842 --> 00:41:10,677
Cooper, do you copy?
Talk to me, Cooper.

474
00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:18,723
My contact's at two metres.
It's gotta be an equipment malfunction.

475
00:41:18,812 --> 00:41:21,184
Novak, they're under the ice.

476
00:41:22,232 --> 00:41:23,975
Novak.

477
00:41:27,153 --> 00:41:28,813
Do you copy, Sydney?

478
00:41:34,452 --> 00:41:36,694
OK, that's it.
Confirm you got the recording.

479
00:41:36,788 --> 00:41:38,827
I'm ready to destroy the music box.

480
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:43,166
Affirmative. We got the recording.

481
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:45,744
Affirmative. I'm 10-7.

482
00:41:57,267 --> 00:42:00,470
- Sydney, do you copy?
- I read you, Dixon. What's wrong?

483
00:42:00,562 --> 00:42:03,765
Get out of there. Sark's here.

484
00:42:06,067 --> 00:42:08,558
Put the case down.

485
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:14,481
Slide it over.

486
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:24,740
It was you giving us
problems at the launch.

487
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:30,790
I'd offer you passage back to civilisation,
but my submersible only seats four.

488
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:32,923
It's the thought that counts.
