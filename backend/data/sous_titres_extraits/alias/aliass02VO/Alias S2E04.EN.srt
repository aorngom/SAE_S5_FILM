1
00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:06,210
OK, I'm in.

2
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:09,215
Agent Bristow works undercover
with her father, Jack Bristow,

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,210
also a double agent with CIA.

4
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:12,417
Get down.

5
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,801
I guess we'll just have
to learn to trust each other.

6
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:17,178
Bristow's CIA contact: Michael Vaughn.

7
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,141
My guardian angel.

8
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:23,806
Her current assignment:
to infiltrate and destroy SD-6,

9
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:27,398
a secret organisation
dealing in espionage, extortion,

10
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,608
weapon sales, posing as the CIA.

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,650
SD-6 has made over $400 million
in arms sales alone.

12
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:38,739
The sanctity of this agency requires
the sacrifice of some personal freedoms.

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:43,409
This is not about cutting off an arm of the
monster. This is about killing the monster.

14
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:46,455
Bristow's mother:
formerly Russian intelligence,

15
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,298
recently turned herself in to the CIA.

16
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,960
Mom?

17
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:56,341
Intel indicates she may still be
an enemy of the United States.

18
00:00:56,431 --> 00:01:01,223
The true loyalty of Agent Bristow's
mother remains unknown.

19
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,019
Previously on <i>Alias:</i>

20
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:06,853
I want your help to persuade Sydney
not to interact with her mother.

21
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:07,522
Why?

22
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:11,938
Because Irina Derevko is an
opportunistic sociopath, who will use

23
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,280
whatever inroads she can make
with my daughter to get what she wants.

24
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:21,487
Well, I'm sorry, but I am not in the habit of
helping a father manipulate his daughter,

25
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,989
no matter how good his intentions may be.

26
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:29,291
Sark is looking for a music box designed
by Rambaldi. The box plays a unique tune.

27
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,504
Encoded within the tune
there's an equation.

28
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,296
- For what?
- Zero point energy.

29
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:41,682
Watch your step. If you fall through the ice,
it'll freeze over in four seconds.

30
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:50,146
Cooper. Reading four, four tangos.
They're heading for the entrance.

31
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,321
Novak, they're under the ice.

32
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:00,909
- Sydney, do you copy?
- I read you, Dixon. What's wrong?

33
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:03,913
Get out of there. Sark's here.

34
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,896
Sydney.

35
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,531
Hi.

36
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:11,618
The music box that you were sent
to retrieve, Mr Sark got away with it?

37
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,702
Yes.

38
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:19,002
But after 500 years buried in the Siberian
ice, the music box was corroded.

39
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,425
It practically fell apart in my hands.

40
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,135
It's odd.

41
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,632
- What's that?
- Milo Rambaldi.

42
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,727
He's done this before, many times.

43
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:38,146
Hiding information inside works of art:
the clock, the sculpture.

44
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,647
Hm?

45
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:42,692
But this time he chose to bury
one of his most important innovations,

46
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:47,859
the formula for zero point energy,
inside a music box.

47
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:52,156
You're talking about an inventor
who lived 500 years ago.

48
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,248
Anything regarding Milo Rambaldi
seems odd to me.

49
00:04:56,338 --> 00:05:01,580
Well, what's unusual isn't how he hid
the information, Sydney - it's where.

50
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,677
Why would Milo Rambaldi
go to the unimaginable length

51
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:09,092
of having catacombs built in Siberia,

52
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:14,225
only to leave his music box
exposed to corrosive elements?

53
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:23,069
Another Rambaldi mystery.

54
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,735
So, do you think Sloane suspects you?

55
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:31,287
That I used the inhaler to corrode
the music box? No, I don't think so.

56
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:36,367
Sloane made sure I knew how relieved
he was that I made it back safely.

57
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,130
I went home and took a shower
and came here.

58
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:44,754
Good. By the way, you should know,
Siberia was a complete success.

59
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,628
When you activated the music box,
we recorded it. It's at Langley for analysis.

60
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:53,219
- So we got the intel and Sloane didn't.
- Neither did Sark.

61
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,307
What?

62
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,988
The information my mother gave us
helped us again. That's all.

63
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,697
You know, you can talk
to me about your mother.

64
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,191
I know that doing that is
harder for you than you make it seem.

65
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,907
- Well, it's my job.
- Vaughn, she killed your father.

66
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,618
- Yes. Thank you.
- You don't have to pretend with me.

67
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,329
- And you don't have to withhold.
- All I'm saying is that it's unfair.

68
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:21,582
Maybe so, but I certainly didn't
join the CIA looking for fairness.

69
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:27,296
After everything she's done to you,
are those things you could ever forgive?

70
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,095
I don't know.

71
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,422
Yeah, well, your father
doesn't share that ambiguity.

72
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,185
He's meeting with
Assistant Director Kendall right now,

73
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:38,432
and he is lobbying to have
your mother taken away.

74
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:46,815
As long as she's helping us in the war
against SD-6 and the Alliance, she stays.

75
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,195
- Did you even read my report?
- Yes, of course.

76
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,490
Well, why are you completely
disregarding what I wrote?

77
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,654
- Great job in Siberia, Agent Bristow.
- Thank you.

78
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,620
Excuse me.

79
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,791
I agree with what you wrote,
that on more than one occasion,

80
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:03,247
your mother has provided
crucial intelligence to the CIA

81
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,249
to the detriment of SD-6.

82
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,461
And it would even appear that her actions
have kept you out of harm's way.

83
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:12,254
- Dad, that's a fact.
- There's another fact.

84
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:16,477
Nothing that woman says or does
can be taken at face value.

85
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,637
Her motivations are strictly her own.

86
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:24,815
Now that your dealings with your mother
have taken on an emotional component,

87
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,191
- I'm concerned.
- Don't be.

88
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,652
I'm more professional than that.

89
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:32,908
Every one of our discussions
has been specific and mission related.

90
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,987
You told her about your school play.

91
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,124
- You heard me tell her I was a turkey?
- Yes.

92
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,837
You were watching me.

93
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,708
Dad, I have enough spying
in my life to worry about...

94
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:51,585
What I've been watching is you making the
same mistakes with that woman that I did.

95
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,464
Sydney, she's someone
you've idealised for almost 20 years.

96
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,014
You didn't learn about her history
with the KGB until recently.

97
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:02,396
- What does that matter?
- That you've wanted a mother -

98
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:07,227
your mother - all your life.

99
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,396
And now here she is.

100
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,565
Dad...

101
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,529
You don't have to worry about me.

102
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,328
I'm not that naive.

103
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:24,454
I'm sure that's something
we both hope is true.

104
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,336
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

105
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:17,761
Several nights ago,
I received a phone call at my home.

106
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:23,092
There was no one at the other end,
just some high-pitched static.

107
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:27,020
But something about the call
left me unsettled.

108
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,228
- Did security section run a trace?
- Yeah.

109
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,907
The call originated in Sonoma, California -
the Barranca bed and breakfast inn.

110
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,741
Emily and I spent some time there.
It was...

111
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,363
It was our favourite getaway.

112
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,032
Simple. It was a wrong number.

113
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:50,249
I'm not so sure.

114
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,463
I don't understand what you're suggesting.

115
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:58,304
I'm suggesting that someone
may be trying to leave me unsettled.

116
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,640
I would like you to send
someone to Sonoma, Jack.

117
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,683
I need to know who made that call.

118
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,475
- Sure. I'll get security section...
- Jack.

119
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:12,069
I don't want this to get back to the Alliance.
They can't know that I'm taking measures.

120
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,146
- I understand.
- Good.

121
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,781
I'll send Dixon.

122
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:20,327
Jack, there's something else.

123
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:24,407
After Sark recovered
Rambaldi's music box,

124
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:27,251
we tracked him to a safe house
in the Falkland Islands.

125
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,209
We sent in a team.

126
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,039
And did we retrieve it?

127
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:38,716
Yes. It was destroyed with age,
as Sydney said. Worthless.

128
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,676
But we found something else.

129
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:47,052
- He was not 80 years old.
- At least.

130
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,890
Syd, I'm serious.

131
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:52,102
I expect, like, a delivery guy
to be totally buffed out.

132
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,853
I mean, he sounded hot on the phone.

133
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:56,068
- Was he a cute 80?
- Shut up.

134
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,777
Hey, Francie, there's a woman
on the phone from the health department.

135
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:02,152
Ooh, I'm getting graded today.

136
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,951
How's it going?

137
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,122
OK.

138
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:17,125
How's your mom?

139
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,587
How are you?

140
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:27,143
I got four weeks left of community service,
then I'm done.

141
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,562
Hey...

142
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,815
You remember last week, when I
cooperated, let the CIA hypnotise me?

143
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:36,227
- Yeah.
- What happened with that?

144
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,397
Was I helpful at all?

145
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,986
I'm only asking because about five minutes
ago I was doing pretty well as a reporter,

146
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:46,244
and now I'm just...
I'm a dishwasher living in denial.

147
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,786
That's all.

148
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:53,917
- The information you provided was huge.
- Huge? Really?

149
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:57,670
Because of you,
the CIA scored a real victory.

150
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,798
I should have told you that before.
I'm sorry.

151
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:03,931
No, no, no, don't worry about it.
That's so good to know.

152
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,227
- Good guys or bad guys?
- Neither.

153
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,555
My father.

154
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:20,321
- Everything OK?
- I talked with Sloane this morning.

155
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,945
He sent a team after Sark.
He wanted to recover the music box.

156
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:26,320
- I told him it was ruined.
- Yes, but he wanted it anyway.

157
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:30,541
He tracked down Sark
to a location in the Falklands.

158
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,786
Sark fought back. He got away.

159
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:45,887
They did, however, find a man at that
location. He was being held, tortured.

160
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:51,181
His name is Claus Richter. Three
weeks ago Richter was in Barcelona.

161
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,429
- When I was there.
- Yes, along with your mother.

162
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:57,390
The operations manual of the organisation
your mother used to run, the Bible,

163
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:01,104
anyone who gets their hands on that book
will gain access to all the contacts,

164
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,949
technology and weaponry
they amassed over the last ten years.

165
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:06,703
Sloane believes your mother
gave the manual to Richter,

166
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,075
that he was the man
who hid the book.

167
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,907
- Do you think that's true?
- I know it is.

168
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:16,159
They brought Richter into an SD-6
holding cell, and I interrogated him.

169
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,041
Before being brought into SD-6,

170
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,338
Richter was screened for
every type of possible infection:

171
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,047
Ebola, HIV, retroviruses.

172
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:27,506
They didn't find a thing,
yet this man was clearly dying.

173
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:30,849
Med-Tech believes he may have been
suffering from an allergic reaction

174
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,391
to something Sark used on him.

175
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:38,108
Apparently, the first sign of illness
was bleeding from the fingernails.

176
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:42,107
Sloane wanted me to torture him,
but that man was tortured as it was.

177
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:44,688
So I gave him morphine.

178
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:02,340
Irina Derevko gave you
the operations manual for her syndicate.

179
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:06,672
I would like you to tell me
where you've hidden it.

180
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,347
Derevko is a great woman.

181
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,139
Morphine's not bad either.

182
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:18,226
Let me be clear. I've only given you
enough to last five minutes.

183
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:23,393
Cooperate and get all you want.
Resist, and you get none.

184
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,202
Where did you hide that manual?

185
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:34,873
The location was too remote to describe.

186
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,081
It turns out Richter had designed a map

187
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,042
to lead your mother back
to the book's location.

188
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:42,213
- So where is the map?
- Inside a first edition of <i>War and Peace</i>

189
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:46,462
located at the technical services library
at FAPSI headquarters in Moscow.

190
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,095
FAPSI headquarters.

191
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:52,177
Sloane is preparing to send you
to Moscow to retrieve Richter's map.

192
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,306
I've had the CIA fabricate a bogus map.

193
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,478
You go to Moscow, retrieve the real one,
which you'll return to the CIA.

194
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:02,439
You'll give SD-6 this map, which will lead
them to the middle of the Sunken Forest.

195
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:05,943
Why have you come to me like this,
before my SD-6 briefing?

196
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:08,700
You giving me the CIA countermission
instead of Vaughn?

197
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,570
- Because this is the best way to respond...
- No, I know what this is.

198
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,986
You don't want me to take this to Mom.

199
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,915
There's no benefit in seeing her.
You have all the information you need.

200
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,782
We don't know that.

201
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:20,449
Sydney, we've been doing this long
enough to know that our system works.

202
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:23,961
The system was stagnant until Mom
turned herself in. Dad, we've covered this.

203
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:25,875
We've both been betrayed by this woman.

204
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,043
The difference between you and me is that

205
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:32,134
I'm willing to squeeze her for everything
she's got to take down the enemy.

206
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:38,392
Anything to get me the hell out of this life
as soon as possible. Anything.

207
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:43,389
- I'm Will, and I'm an addict.
- Hi, Will.

208
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:48,567
I never thought about my reputation
until I lost it.

209
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:55,406
It all happened very publicly, so people
actually look at me at the market and stuff.

210
00:15:55,497 --> 00:16:00,289
"Oh, hey, there's the drug addict
from the newspaper."

211
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:10,424
Well, actually, there has been one
happy by-product from all this.

212
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:17,179
I have a good friend, who, it turns out,
I, uh, I didn't know at all before.

213
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:22,595
And now she and I can talk
in a way that we never did before.

214
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:24,767
And, uh...

215
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:31,407
And I don't think I would
trade that for anything.

216
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:45,503
- Same thing happened to me.
- What?

217
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:53,131
I learnt who my true friends were
when everyone found out about my habit.

218
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:56,804
- Um, Rebecca Martinez.
- Hey, I'm Will.

219
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,976
I know who you are, Will Tippin.
I read your articles.

220
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:05,815
The reporter with the big imagination who
fell in love with the heroin chic lifestyle.

221
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,352
- Yeah, yeah, that's me.
- But my theory?

222
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:13,856
I don't think you ever
really were a drug addict.

223
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,113
Why would you say that?

224
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:18,784
I believe what you wrote
about SD-6 was true.

225
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:22,620
I think you got too close to
some kind of secret conspiracy

226
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,084
and they had to shut you down.

227
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:27,419
They probably came after you,
told you not to talk.

228
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:31,752
I mean, they couldn't kill you, could they?
No, that would expose them.

229
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:34,844
So they threatened you and then,
to ruin your rep, they shot you up.

230
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,472
No, no.

231
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,723
I made up all that stuff about SD-6.
That was me.

232
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,479
That was me being an idiot.

233
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:48,190
- What?
- I just... Sorry, I'm...

234
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:53,567
I'm sort of a conspiracy theorist.
I have a web page: conspiracychick. com.

235
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,654
I wanna prove your story
about SD-6 was real.

236
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,392
Claus Richter is in SD-6 custody.

237
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:33,023
I'm aware that you refuse
to give the CIA details

238
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:37,525
about this operations manual
that you had Richter hide away.

239
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,574
And I understand why.

240
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:45,580
The knowledge contained in that manual
is your only leverage.

241
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:51,123
But now, having spoken with Richter,
SD-6 is after it.

242
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:56,508
Richter was found
in the custody of Mr Sark.

243
00:18:56,594 --> 00:19:02,964
We don't know what Sark knows. He might
already have the map in his possession.

244
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:06,927
I'm here because SD-6
is sending me to Moscow.

245
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:09,228
I'm going to retrieve the map
at FAPSI headquarters.

246
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:14,523
So if you want to help the CIA,
as you claim to,

247
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:21,445
you'll give us any information you have that
will facilitate the recovery of Richter's map.

248
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,577
When I turned myself over to CIA,

249
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,123
a pair of earrings were taken from me.

250
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:39,587
They have sentimental value.
I'd like them back.

251
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,805
I'll see what I can do.

252
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:52,104
Then, in good faith, tell me how
you plan on breaking into the library.

253
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:56,059
She went to see her mother.

254
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:59,772
I tried... I tried to stop her.
I made it clear.

255
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,693
Made what clear?

256
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:05,403
Trusting her mother -
she's playing with fire.

257
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:11,084
- We've had this discussion.
- There is no one else to do this job.

258
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:16,543
- Sydney went to see her mother?
- Yes, she's there now.

259
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:17,913
Looking for help.

260
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:21,758
The east wing stairwell is an option.
I can see why SD-6 chose that route.

261
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:25,298
But there's a better way
to get to the sixth-floor library.

262
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,799
Write this down.

263
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:32,852
Once you're inside the building, don't take
the main stairs. You just look to your left...

264
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:38,777
No one wants a happy ending to this story
more than I do, but I know this woman.

265
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,903
I know her charms.

266
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,482
I know her tricks.

267
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:50,656
The way she presents herself, she disarms
you. Some people have that talent.

268
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,372
Compared to all of them,

269
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:57,459
Irina Derevko is extraordinary.

270
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:02,045
Is there any chance that
all she wants is forgiveness?

271
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:03,335
No.

272
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,465
Be specific about your concerns.

273
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,104
I don't know what it is Derevko wants.

274
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:18,603
Maybe something within the CIA,
maybe to recruit Sydney to her side.

275
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:21,400
I can tell you, I know this:

276
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:25,658
Derevko is using this agency
and my daughter

277
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:28,282
to get whatever it is that she wants,

278
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:34,872
and everywhere I look, people are
complacent and cooperative, listening to...

279
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:41,710
listening to a woman
who killed operatives of the CIA,

280
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:44,588
who destroyed countless lives.

281
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:47,253
Yours.

282
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:56,558
We'll take your suggestions
into consideration.

283
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,022
Be careful.

284
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:16,208
You asked me what I was afraid of.

285
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,744
I can tell you. It's obvious.

286
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:26,094
I'm afraid of losing my daughter.

287
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:40,477
Hey.

288
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:45,396
So, I heard your father came to see you,
and he tried to preempt my involvement.

289
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,946
He was just trying to keep me
away from my mother.

290
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:50,739
I know.

291
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:55,538
She actually had some intel
for this mission that could help.

292
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,950
Good.

293
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:02,872
Listen, as far as your mother's concerned,
it's ridiculous for you to worry about me.

294
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:06,501
I'm fine.
What she did to my father, I can handle.

295
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:11,303
But when I heard what your father did,
coming to see you like that, I...

296
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:15,471
I realised how insane this must be for him.

297
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:17,934
Having your mother back in his life.

298
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:23,106
Which only concerned me
because that means

299
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:26,777
he's not making it any easier for you.

300
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:30,529
So, before you leave for Moscow,

301
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:34,617
I just wanted to say that

302
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:39,997
you might feel alone in all this,
like you don't have an ally.

303
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:45,174
I'm your ally.

304
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:47,796
Never question that.

305
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:52,014
Miss Bristow, your plane's standing by.

306
00:23:57,812 --> 00:23:59,769
I'll see you when I get back.

307
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:34,902
OK, these medals that you won?
Well, you didn't really win them

308
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:38,777
and they're not really medals. This one
right here is the Order of Bravery, right?

309
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:42,490
Not a medal, right?
No, it's an electronic skeleton key.

310
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:46,000
It'll get you access to the sixth floor.

311
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:59,803
This one, the Order of Zhukov, first class.
This'll get you into the technical library.

312
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:11,938
Now, this one is the Order of Merit.
It'll get you into the ASRS.

313
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,358
- What's ASRS?
- Oh, yeah.

314
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:15,904
The majority of the books are kept in
a secure area underneath the building.

315
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:18,993
Now, in order to get them, you're going
to need to get to the selection terminal.

316
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,988
What you'll do is you'll type in
the name of the book that you want,

317
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:23,369
then there's going to be
this automatic crane thing

318
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:25,201
that retrieves the book that you requested,

319
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:29,207
and then deposits it
over on the sixth floor, OK?

320
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:31,835
Now, just make sure that
you don't remove the metal

321
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:35,625
until after you've logged out the system,
or you'll probably set off the alarm, OK?

322
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,045
Ow.

323
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:39,598
Actually felt quite good.

324
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:58,443
Whatever Arvin Sloane pays you,
it can't be enough.

325
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:03,244
Would you consider coming to work for me
if it meant I'd let you walk out of here?

326
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:06,118
I believe if you took the time
to hear a comprehensive offer,

327
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:09,080
you might actually say yes.

328
00:27:12,507 --> 00:27:14,334
You're cute, but I'll pass.

329
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:12,479
- Go ahead.
- It's me.

330
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:15,651
I am trapped in the technical services
building. I need a way out.

331
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:19,272
My mother said something about
secret passages. Get her on the phone.

332
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:31,040
Sydney's trapped in the FAPSI building
in Moscow. She needs a way out - now.

333
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:33,453
- Where is she exactly?
- Where are you exactly?

334
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:36,216
- An office on the seventh floor.
- An office on the seventh floor.

335
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:41,008
- Whose office?
- Whose office?

336
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:43,847
- General Vitali Simonov.
- General Vitali Simonov.

337
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:46,470
Ask her if there's an abstract painting
behind the desk.

338
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,560
Is there an abstract painting
behind the desk?

339
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:51,722
Yes, yes, yes.

340
00:28:52,691 --> 00:28:57,767
Behind it there's an activation switch
for a private security door.

341
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:19,297
- What time does this place open?
- Not for another hour.

342
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:22,420
I'm out and I've got the map.

343
00:29:22,512 --> 00:29:26,177
Copy, Freelancer.
See you at home.

344
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:36,522
How do you say thank you
to the woman who killed your father?

345
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:39,692
You don't.

346
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:53,493
- Sark asked you to come work with him?
- Like it wasn't even a question.

347
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:55,661
Like it was a done deal.

348
00:29:55,754 --> 00:29:57,627
Sark is like the good-looking guy
in high school

349
00:29:57,714 --> 00:30:02,127
who knows how cute he is
and won't take no for an answer.

350
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:05,219
Any suspicious reactions
to the map you gave SD-6?

351
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:07,926
- No, they're analysing it now.
- Good.

352
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:10,305
We have a CIA tech
trying to decode the real map.

353
00:30:10,393 --> 00:30:11,887
I know they're having trouble with it.

354
00:30:11,978 --> 00:30:15,430
Do you think Richter used
a cipher text only they could read?

355
00:30:15,523 --> 00:30:17,267
Maybe.

356
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:21,985
Your mother might be
able to help us with this.

357
00:30:22,072 --> 00:30:27,279
If you're asking me to go see her again,
she did have a request.

358
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:32,286
They've been checked
for hidden compartments,

359
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:34,283
transmitters, passive sensors.

360
00:30:34,376 --> 00:30:36,949
Every sharp edge has been dulled.

361
00:30:37,712 --> 00:30:41,461
I was 21 years old when I was given these.

362
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:46,507
At graduation from the academy,
my mother,

363
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:48,221
your grandmother,

364
00:30:50,308 --> 00:30:52,384
put these in my hands.

365
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:55,853
I cried.

366
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:00,189
She said "Sweetheart, wear them well."

367
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:02,981
You would have liked her,

368
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:08,065
had things been different.

369
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:26,214
We need you to decode the map.

370
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:34,552
I have a request.

371
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:36,889
Sure.

372
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:40,728
Mr Sloane is concerned about a phone call
he received at home last Thursday night.

373
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:46,986
The call was traced to the Barranca
bed and breakfast in Sonoma, California.

374
00:31:47,073 --> 00:31:49,564
He's asked me
to send someone to Sonoma,

375
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:52,411
find out who was staying there,
who might have made the call.

376
00:31:52,495 --> 00:31:56,279
- Whatever information you can get.
- Sounds easy enough.

377
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:59,282
No one's to know about this.

378
00:32:00,253 --> 00:32:01,581
Understood.

379
00:32:09,763 --> 00:32:13,013
Madagascar, close to Sambava.

380
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:17,144
Latitude: minus 14 degrees, 26 minutes.

381
00:32:17,228 --> 00:32:24,524
Longitude: 49 degrees,
57 minutes and 20 seconds.

382
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:34,702
She says the building is clean. There are
no explosives or anti-intrusion systems.

383
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:38,322
- We obviously can't trust this information.
- Dad, come on.

384
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:41,417
If she wanted me dead, she could have
left me stuck at FAPSI headquarters.

385
00:32:41,503 --> 00:32:43,294
Your mother knows that
the only leverage she has

386
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,538
is the information about her agency.

387
00:32:45,632 --> 00:32:47,506
As soon as we get that manual,
she's got nothing.

388
00:32:47,592 --> 00:32:49,501
Unless she wants to prove herself.

389
00:32:49,594 --> 00:32:52,050
That's the kind of hopeful thinking
that will get you killed.

390
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:54,131
- I'm going in.
- No, you're not.

391
00:32:54,224 --> 00:32:55,967
Irina Derevko's proved her value...

392
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:58,632
Do not talk to me about
that woman's value.

393
00:32:58,728 --> 00:33:02,014
Of all people, you should know better.

394
00:33:02,107 --> 00:33:04,598
We're sending you to Madagascar
to retrieve the Bible.

395
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:07,148
You two, prepare to leave tonight.

396
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:12,195
I want you to deal with Sydney's cover
at SD-6. Let's move it.

397
00:33:27,924 --> 00:33:29,964
The team will be in Madagascar
in 12 hours.

398
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:32,673
I'll need you to have
everything in place by then.

399
00:33:32,762 --> 00:33:36,546
On that time frame,
I'll have to parachute in.

400
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:45,064
Jack, I owe you.
But why 30lb of Semtex?

401
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,985
I could do the same job with 5lb of C-4.

402
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:55,951
I need you to make sure that if anyone
enters that building, no one will survive.

403
00:33:58,997 --> 00:34:03,540
God grant us the serenity
to accept the things we cannot change,

404
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:06,378
courage to change the things we can,

405
00:34:06,463 --> 00:34:10,045
and wisdom to know the difference.

406
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:15,128
Don't forget, next meeting
Patty's bringing the doughnuts.

407
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:25,012
Hey. I had a thought.
You and I could do this together.

408
00:34:25,106 --> 00:34:26,138
Do what together?

409
00:34:26,232 --> 00:34:29,103
You could tell me what to do.
Who to contact, what to write.

410
00:34:29,194 --> 00:34:32,148
I can publish it all on my web page,
totally anonymous.

411
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:34,908
- Rebecca...
- And we could hang out.

412
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:40,244
Which could be kinda nice.
Do you like frozen yoghurt?

413
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:43,913
I already told you that the whole thing
about SD-6, it was all fictional.

414
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,660
Will, come on.

415
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:50,213
Now, why would anyone,
especially you, make up a story like that?

416
00:34:52,425 --> 00:34:56,553
OK, just tell me this.
Did they do this to you?

417
00:35:00,975 --> 00:35:03,513
A friend of mine, her fiancé was killed.

418
00:35:03,603 --> 00:35:06,272
The police, they thought
it was just a random shooting,

419
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:09,440
that some guy had
broken into his apartment.

420
00:35:09,526 --> 00:35:12,859
And I was worried about her.
I decided to play hero.

421
00:35:12,946 --> 00:35:18,071
I was gonna find out who killed him,
and after that I was gonna...

422
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:21,445
I don't know, maybe, uh...

423
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:24,989
maybe our relationship would be different.

424
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:28,915
But the more that I looked into it,
the less I found.

425
00:35:30,046 --> 00:35:32,003
Then I had to make it up,

426
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,379
because to me it was more important
not to let her down

427
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:37,634
than it was for me
to just be honest with her.

428
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:43,593
So, you wanna look into SD-6?
Hey. Good luck.

429
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:55,609
Will Tippin shouldn't be a problem.
I gave him a number of opportunities,

430
00:35:55,697 --> 00:36:00,193
all recorded on audio files,
to restart his SD-6 investigation.

431
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:02,776
Tippin never took the bait.

432
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:05,955
- Security section's seen that?
- Yes.

433
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:09,575
And they're classifying Tippin
as a nonthreat.

434
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:11,707
Good.

435
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:22,925
- Did you talk to the desk clerk?
- Yes, I did, sir.

436
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:26,716
The Barranca Inn has no way of linking
a back-trace for an outside line

437
00:36:26,811 --> 00:36:31,473
to an individual room, so we don't know
which room it was that called your home.

438
00:36:31,566 --> 00:36:35,943
But we do know who was
staying at the inn that night.

439
00:36:46,873 --> 00:36:48,996
Is that your wife's signature?

440
00:37:13,692 --> 00:37:19,113
Freelancer has reached the target
and is heading toward position.

441
00:37:20,323 --> 00:37:23,158
We have you on-screen, Freelancer.

442
00:37:32,585 --> 00:37:34,495
There's the house.

443
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:39,498
Freelancer's going in.

444
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:44,922
We're at the door.

445
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:55,816
Can you switch from the real-time
SAT radar scan to infrared?

446
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,395
Switching to infrared.

447
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:07,026
- Sydney, hold your entry.
- What is it, Dad?

448
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,825
The building is wired to explode.

449
00:38:09,914 --> 00:38:11,325
See how these areas don't give off

450
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:13,040
the same amount of heat
as the surrounding structure?

451
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:16,827
- That's because they're not made of wood.
- What are they made of?

452
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:23,174
Sydney, I need you to take a look
under the house. Is there a crawlspace?

453
00:38:58,922 --> 00:39:01,413
She lied to me.

454
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:07,337
Sydney, come on.

455
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,506
We're pulling back.

456
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:14,351
If she was counting on my trust,

457
00:39:14,437 --> 00:39:17,474
that I would just walk in there
and set off the explosives,

458
00:39:17,565 --> 00:39:18,894
then why did she help us get this far?

459
00:39:18,983 --> 00:39:21,984
There are enough explosives in there
to blow this entire place,

460
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,101
operation manual included.

461
00:39:23,196 --> 00:39:25,983
Your mother was using us
to destroy it for her.

462
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:28,150
Secure the perimeter until...

463
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:36,496
Your efficient reconnaissance work
saved us the trouble of using our GPS.

464
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:38,162
Thank you.

465
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:46,166
Go inside and recover
the operations manual.

466
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,926
You escaped technical directorate
after lockdown.

467
00:39:50,015 --> 00:39:52,506
Clearly you had no trouble
decoding the map.

468
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,934
I'm surprised Claus Richter was
so willing to reveal his secrets.

469
00:39:56,021 --> 00:39:58,690
If I didn't know any better,
I'd guess you had another source.

470
00:40:01,985 --> 00:40:03,812
Sydney. Sydney.

471
00:40:14,497 --> 00:40:16,704
Where's Sark?

472
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:18,867
They're gone.

473
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:31,139
Sydney, are you OK?

474
00:40:31,222 --> 00:40:32,847
We're OK, Dad.

475
00:40:33,725 --> 00:40:35,801
We're coming home.

476
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:51,439
This is Assistant Director Kendall. I want
Irina Derevko removed from this facility.

477
00:40:51,534 --> 00:40:56,742
I want her transferred to Camp Harris
for unrestricted interrogation.

478
00:40:56,831 --> 00:40:58,788
She'll be gone within the hour.

479
00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:02,742
You were right about her, Jack.
You were right.

480
00:41:05,215 --> 00:41:13,839
If I build a wall a hundred feet tall

481
00:41:13,932 --> 00:41:18,309
Would that keep you in?

482
00:41:20,021 --> 00:41:29,144
If I shackled your feet
so you couldn't leave

483
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:35,573
Would you try and run?

484
00:41:57,851 --> 00:42:02,845
I thought there might have been
a chance to believe...

485
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:07,808
to believe that she had no hidden agenda.

486
00:42:19,622 --> 00:42:22,908
Everything you said was right.

487
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,706
And I was so stupid.

488
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:37,214
I'm sorry, Dad.

489
00:42:41,186 --> 00:42:44,103
I'm sorry that I doubted you.

490
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:50,394
I'm sorry, Dad.
