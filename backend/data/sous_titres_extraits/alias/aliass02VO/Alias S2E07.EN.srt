1
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:06,168
OK. I'm in.

2
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:09,257
Agent Bristow works undercover
with her father, Jack Bristow,

3
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:11,216
also a double agent with CIA.

4
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:12,382
Get down.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,842
I guess we'll just have to learn
to trust each other.

6
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:17,090
Bristow's CIA contact: Michael Vaughn.

7
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:19,176
My guardian angel.

8
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:23,812
Her current assignment:
to infiltrate and destroy SD-6,

9
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:27,350
a secret organisation
dealing in espionage, extortion,

10
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,483
weapon sales, posing as the CIA.

11
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:32,691
SD-6 has made over $400 million
in arms sales alone.

12
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:38,911
The sanctity of this agency requires
the sacrifice of some personal freedoms.

13
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:43,540
This is not about cutting off an arm of the
monster. This is about killing the monster.

14
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:46,462
Bristow's mother:
formerly Russian intelligence,

15
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,464
recently turned herself in to the CIA.

16
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,008
Mom?

17
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:56,513
Intel indicates she may still be
an enemy of the United States.

18
00:00:56,598 --> 00:01:01,343
The true loyalty of Agent Bristow's mother
remains unknown.

19
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,510
Previously on <i>Alias:</i>

20
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,147
I could pay you to do research.

21
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,058
All I need you to do is find out
if any of these questions

22
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,527
ever appeared on a standardised test in
the United States over the last 20 years.

23
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,321
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

24
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,692
Five weeks ago you infiltrated
one of your mother's laboratories in Taipei,

25
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,528
where you discovered a Rambaldi device.

26
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,111
We believe the device
is the source of the virus.

27
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:24,824
Unfortunately, you and Agent Vaughn
may have been exposed.

28
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:28,038
We'd like to draw some blood
and keep you under observation.

29
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:31,629
Agent Bristow, your tests came back
negative for antibodies. You're free to go.

30
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:34,386
Agent Vaughn, your tests at this point
are inconclusive.

31
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,597
You said Sark tested Patient Zero's blood
at the first sign of infection.

32
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:41,054
What was the sign?

33
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:45,092
Haemorrhaging from the fingernails.

34
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,591
This is Dr Nicholas calling.

35
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:24,716
Thanks for getting back to me so soon.
The thing is, I think I have a problem.

36
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,842
I know you're worried,

37
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:29,638
but we ran every available diagnostic test
for viral infections.

38
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,891
Everything that could be related
to your exposure

39
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,645
to the fluid
inside the Rambaldi device.

40
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:37,604
- They all came back negative.
- Yes, I know.

41
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,659
Under my fingernails, there's blood.

42
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,291
OK, here's what we're gonna do.
The virus isn't airborne,

43
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,246
but as a precaution, I'm gonna send
an isolation unit to bring you in.

44
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:54,880
Don't send anyone. I'll come to you.
But first there's someone I need to see.

45
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:58,834
See them later.
Right now, you stay put.

46
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,792
I know what you did for me.

47
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,925
Proving Sydney's father
betrayed her in Madagascar.

48
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,130
I would have been executed for that.

49
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,551
Thank you.

50
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,388
I didn't do it for you.

51
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,434
While that might be true,

52
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,563
I owe you my life.

53
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,148
You owe me my father's life.

54
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:08,904
In Cap Ferrat,
I saw Khasinau experiment on people

55
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:12,165
who'd been exposed to the liquid
from inside the red ball.

56
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,540
I want to know
what he learned from doing that.

57
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,788
- If he found a cure?
- Yes.

58
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:20,467
I know the terms are
you only cooperate with Sydney,

59
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:24,134
but this disease, it works quickly.

60
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,511
I don't have much time.

61
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:30,013
You're the one who's sick.

62
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,521
Yes.

63
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:37,944
Tell me how you feel
about my daughter.

64
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,688
That's none of your business.

65
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,991
- Are you in love with her?
- I don't know why that matters to you.

66
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:49,236
I don't have the advantage
of observing casual behaviour.

67
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,825
- I'm curious.
- Help me,

68
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,708
and I'll tell you
what you want to know.

69
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:08,379
OK, tell me if this sounds weird.
I mean, can we talk here?

70
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:16,680
- A bug killer, in case anyone's listening.
- Seriously? In the lipstick?

71
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,020
What were you gonna say?

72
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,018
I look up 20 years
of standardised tests

73
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:23,029
to see if any of those IQ-type questions
Vaughn's interested in were used.

74
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,193
And?

75
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,073
They weren't - at least
in none of the tests I looked up.

76
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,534
But there was a year missing.

77
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,489
And the Educational Testing Service
didn't have a hard copy or a disk.

78
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,996
I mean, it is like 1982 never existed.

79
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:37,203
Maybe someone had a reason
to make it disappear.

80
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:42,502
You've got to try this bouillabaisse
that I'm making. Here.

81
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,751
What do you think?
Too spicy? Too salty?

82
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,920
- Perfect.
- I'll be done in, like, two minutes.

83
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,172
OK, great.

84
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,637
- So it's weird, right?
- There was an operation

85
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,514
called Project Christmas.

86
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:59,223
My father developed it.
It used standardised tests,

87
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:03,896
asking specific questions to identify
children the Agency could later recruit.

88
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,230
- Children?
- It was an experiment.

89
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:10,192
The KGB sent my mother here
to steal details about the program.

90
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:14,070
About that time,
the CIA stopped the operation.

91
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:20,168
Vaughn thinks maybe Russian intelligence
is still running it to recruit Americans.

92
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,040
- Hello?
- We need you at Operations.

93
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,800
I'll tell Francie you say goodbye.

94
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,468
Hey. What's up?

95
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:39,477
It's Vaughn.
He's developed symptoms.

96
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,235
What symptoms?
The doctors said we were fine.

97
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,525
Yes, but his exposure
was far more extensive.

98
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,649
He's developed some kind of
a blood coagulation disorder.

99
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:52,070
- Do we...? Are we sure that it...?
- We're sure.

100
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,581
Where is he?

101
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,326
He came to see your mother
about an antidote.

102
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,707
Shortly after leaving the facility,
he collapsed.

103
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:12,679
- Is there an antidote?
- Yes. It can be found in Paldiski.

104
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:16,633
It's a former Soviet training base
for nuclear submarine personnel.

105
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:20,061
- Who operates the base now?
- When Estonia gained independence,

106
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:26,233
the local authorities graciously accepted
our offer to take over the facility.

107
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:31,232
I can tell you where it is in the facility,
but even if you can get it,

108
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:34,327
I can't guarantee anything.

109
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,497
This antidote sounds
almost as dangerous as the infection.

110
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,369
- If Derevko's telling us the truth...
- Which is a valid question.

111
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,334
.. then the serum is a blood derivative,

112
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,338
meaning you can't just go get the medicine
and inject it into the sick patient.

113
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,752
How would something like this work?

114
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,000
You need blood from the patient,
in this case Vaughn.

115
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,335
The equipment that manufactures
the serum reads the blood

116
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,845
and creates a custom genetic-specific
antidote for that particular patient.

117
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,388
I'll need to take
some of Vaughn's blood with me?

118
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,268
- Yes.
- This is Agent Chapman.

119
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:03,221
He'll be running the op from here while
your father leads the team into Paldiski.

120
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,858
According to Derevko,

121
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:08,312
the antidote is located at
three separate decontamination stations

122
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,065
within the former nuclear facility.

123
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,821
We'll launch a Zodiac a couple of miles up
the coast and drop you as close as we can.

124
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,986
The plane's ready.
You can spec out the mission in flight.

125
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,029
You've got 30 minutes with Vaughn,
maybe less.

126
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,829
How much time does Vaughn have?

127
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:27,711
There doesn't seem to be a consistent
pattern, but the virus could act quickly.

128
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:31,879
- Are we talking weeks, days? Just tell me.
- Given his level of exposure,

129
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,887
three days would be my guess.

130
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,851
I'll buy time for us with Sloane. Go.

131
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:05,415
Slumber, my darling

132
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:09,715
Thy mother is near

133
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:17,427
Guarding thy dreams
from all terror and fear

134
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,469
- Hi.
- Hi.

135
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,185
I talked to my mother.

136
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,558
There's an antidote.
I'm gonna go get it.

137
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:32,146
- How dangerous?
- Getting the serum?

138
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,527
Nah, it'll be easy.

139
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:42,120
But I need to take
some of your blood with me, OK?

140
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:46,536
Sweet visions attend thy sleep

141
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:53,340
Fondest, dearest to me

142
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:01,888
While others their revels keep

143
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:06,313
I will watch over thee

144
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:10,609
A couple of days,
you'll be doing wind sprints.

145
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:15,690
Slumber, my darling

146
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:19,281
The birds are at rest

147
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,531
Be careful.

148
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:27,619
Wandering dews
by the flowers are caressed

149
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,794
Syd...

150
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,963
I'm sorry. I'm so tired.

151
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,803
Pray that the angels

152
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:45,391
Will shield thee from harm

153
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,352
- Vaughn.
- He's bleeding internally.

154
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:55,647
- Shall we prepare for a peritoneal lavage?
- Yes. Have you called the blood bank?

155
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:58,574
We've already typed and crossed
for six units of packed RBCs.

156
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,283
- Did you reach Dr Simon?
- He's not on call.

157
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:04,033
- But Dr Cozman is on his way in.
- Wait, wait, wait. What's going on?

158
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:07,870
- Is he gonna be all right?
- We don't know. But you have to wait here.

159
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:08,825
Your designated cover:

160
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,994
you're with the State Department's
Bureau of Arms Control.

161
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:15,132
Your name is Rita Stevens.
Give no details about his illness.

162
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,921
Excuse me.

163
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,716
Did they tell you anything?

164
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,964
- No.
- The paramedics called.

165
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:27,435
"What was his last meal?"
"Is he allergic to any medication?"

166
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,605
I got to the hospital
as fast as I could.

167
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,775
So you work with Michael?

168
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,525
Yeah. We're in the same bureau at State.

169
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,314
I'm Rita.

170
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:47,946
I'm Alice. I'm listed as his emergency
contact. I'm Michael's girlfriend.

171
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,578
Excuse me.

172
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,413
I was contacted by an informant in Baku.

173
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:40,167
He indicated that the Triad has set up
a listening post near the Armenian border.

174
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,632
I took the liberty of
assigning the recon op to Sydney.

175
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:45,556
I'll be on the next plane myself.

176
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,847
I went ahead with the exhumation.
I opened Emily's grave.

177
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:57,228
It was empty.

178
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:01,482
Have you checked with the funeral home,
detailed a forensic unit to the grave site?

179
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,823
- I saw her, Jack.
- Maybe. You can't be sure.

180
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:09,073
Emily's alive.
And she knows what I did.

181
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,533
So I am dead to her.

182
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,130
If the Alliance finds out about this
from another source...

183
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:22,466
I just got off the phone with Kristof.

184
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:26,301
I told him that someone was trying
to make it look like I faked Emily's death

185
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,761
in order to secure my position.

186
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,139
- That was the smart play.
- I'm not so sure.

187
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,181
Even if they believe me,
the timing might make it seem

188
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:39,064
like I was looking for an excuse
for my recent performance.

189
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,643
Are there concerns?

190
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,441
Since I was made a partner in the Alliance,

191
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:48,364
SD-6 has consistently stumbled
in its operations.

192
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:51,122
We lost a terahertz wave camera.

193
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,697
We failed to retrieve
the formula for zero-point energy.

194
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,958
We didn't acquire
Derevko's operations manual.

195
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:01,588
The situation regarding Emily
has been a distraction.

196
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:06,633
Informing them
puts these setbacks in context.

197
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:11,099
Kristof wants me
to meet with him in Tokyo.

198
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:17,020
I need a victory, Jack. I need to bring
something tangible to the organisation.

199
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:25,739
We have an asset in custody downstairs
who is familiar with Derevko's operation.

200
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:29,157
I suggest we take advantage of that.

201
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:37,997
As the virus progresses, it causes
something called "ascending paralysis".

202
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:42,036
Your nervous system is being poisoned
from your feet up.

203
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:47,257
You see the paralysis is affecting the
nerves that control your ability to breathe.

204
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,382
Soon you will suffocate.

205
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:53,723
Interestingly, you still have feeling
where you're paralysed.

206
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,261
You can still feel both pleasure

207
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,768
and pain.

208
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:06,148
Tell me, where is Derevko's
base of operations?

209
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,446
Please...

210
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,383
I want a location.

211
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,975
Smila.

212
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,640
Smila.

213
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:05,961
- Hey. Thanks for meeting me.
- So I did the work you asked me to do,

214
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:09,667
but please don't tell me you're chasing
some alleged CIA conspiracy again.

215
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:14,174
- I'm just helping out a friend, that's all.
- Well, you can tell your friend

216
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:17,385
the questions he's interested in
weren't on the test in '82.

217
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,177
Are you sure?

218
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:21,223
Those ridiculously difficult
spatial relationship questions,

219
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,974
the ones about why rainbows occur,

220
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:25,272
and why we have to be standing
behind the sun to see them.

221
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,978
- Yeah.
- They're not on there. Sorry.

222
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:34,951
Come on. Off the record,
what's this all about?

223
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,536
These are propulsion boots.
You can do five knots with them.

224
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:48,127
We drop you 100 yards offshore, you
should be at the pier in under two minutes.

225
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:53,553
Heckler & Koch P11 underwater pistol.
Holds five rounds of trank darts.

226
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:56,758
Thing's virtually silent.

227
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,475
Good luck.

228
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:31,834
I'm at stage one, outside the facility.

229
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:34,797
Copy that, Mountaineer.
We're standing by.

230
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,074
I just spotted Sark.

231
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:05,332
No need to remind you to stay out of sight.

232
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,755
Our intel indicates that
to use the serum generator,

233
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,055
you need the security passcode.

234
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,978
The jack in this computer,
it's got a satellite link

235
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:28,190
that'll let us get into their system
and provide you with the code you'll need.

236
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,618
I've got sat link.
You should be receiving data now.

237
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:42,490
Roger, Mountaineer.
Stand by for the passcode.

238
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,199
Two, six, six, four, seven, two, nine.

239
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,415
Two, six, six, four, seven...

240
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:49,831
- Wait.
- What?

241
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:53,002
The generator's a peripheral
to the main system.

242
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:56,460
The machine is connected
to their central security system.

243
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:59,803
If you try to generate the serum,
their security system will be alerted.

244
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,677
- Can we circumvent the system?
- Not from here.

245
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,685
Mountaineer, abort the op and head back.
We'll find another way.

246
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,807
Abort? We don't have time
to find something else.

247
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,021
If you use the machine,
they'll know you're there.

248
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:12,224
Then I'll run fast.

249
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:16,945
You've been ordered to abort, Mountaineer.
Do you copy?

250
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:41,886
Sir, someone has accessed
the decontamination room.

251
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:34,062
Agent Bristow. Those pipes are rigged
to disperse ammonia fluorochloride.

252
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,519
Wonderful for decontaminating
metals and concrete.

253
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:40,815
Not so good on organic materials.

254
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,816
Such as your suit.

255
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,075
Or your skin.

256
00:20:55,505 --> 00:21:00,926
You and I, we're destined to work together.
I truly believe that.

257
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:14,686
Of course, any future collaboration requires
my turning the sprinkler system off.

258
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:20,361
Notice your suit is already being eaten
away. I'd give it another 40 seconds.

259
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:25,405
I could use your help.
I need access to Arvin Sloane.

260
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:29,408
- Why?
- Because I intend to kill him.

261
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:40,999
I can get you to Sloane, but only
if you promise to let me keep the antidote.

262
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:47,174
No. Sloane first.
Then you get back your precious antidote.

263
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:05,909
Sark had me taken to
the decontamination room. He let me go.

264
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:08,234
I came back here to Los Angeles.

265
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,735
And Sark never asked
who the antidote was for?

266
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:15,492
- No, he didn't seem to care.
- What exactly did you promise Sark?

267
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:19,962
That I would find a way to render Sloane
unconscious and deliver him to Sark.

268
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:22,800
- So he could kill him?
- Yes.

269
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:25,422
There are just so many problems with this
that I don't even know where to begin.

270
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:27,136
- How about we start with Vaughn?
- Do I need to remind you

271
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:31,718
that American intelligence agents are
not in the business of committing murder?

272
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,597
Arvin Sloane killed my fiancé.

273
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:37,891
I have had plenty of opportunities
to return the favour,

274
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:41,434
but I have chosen not to because,
yes, I know, it's not what we do.

275
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:45,608
It's what he does, and it's reprehensible,
but we have no choice here.

276
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:49,827
Vaughn could be dead in two days.
What the hell would you have done?

277
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:52,449
- You don't collaborate with the enemy.
- There is no choice here.

278
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:54,781
- Sydney...
- I am not going to do nothing.

279
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,579
Give us a minute, would you?

280
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,460
Don't try and convince me
not to work with Sark.

281
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:07,966
That's not what I'm doing. I'm on
your side here. We can't lose Vaughn.

282
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:10,972
- So what do we do?
- We don't go through Kendall.

283
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:16,431
Push him and he'll run it through channels.
This needs to be handled quietly.

284
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:19,972
Sloane is scheduled
to attend an Alliance meeting in Tokyo.

285
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,106
I'll find out the details of his itinerary.

286
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:25,894
My STU is not recognising
my crypto-ignition key. I need it fixed.

287
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:28,859
Do you know that polar bears can't be
detected by infrared photography?

288
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:33,411
The fur emits no heat.
Nothing. <i>Nada. </i> Zip.

289
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,787
I just thought maybe it would be
applicable to something I've...

290
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:46,917
Crypto-ignition key. I gotta do that
from the server room. Excuse me.

291
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,636
What's that?

292
00:23:57,729 --> 00:24:01,892
It's one of those standardised tests
kids take.

293
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:05,648
A friend from the newspaper
is interested in me maybe tutoring his kid.

294
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:09,900
"Reading comprehension essay
based on our invasion of Grenada"?

295
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:13,028
Yeah, it was weird. The only test
I could download was from 1982,

296
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:16,535
so at the height of the Reagan era,
Cold War indoctrination.

297
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:19,956
Well, back when I was listening
to Duran Duran every single day,

298
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:24,123
my uncle was one of the Marines
Reagan sent into Grenada.

299
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:26,752
The invasion was in 1983.

300
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:30,045
I mean, why would the Department
of Education give you a fake test?

301
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:32,425
How can I get a hold
of a copy of the original test?

302
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:34,886
For the love of God, Will,
have you lost your mind?

303
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:38,842
- The whole test is a fake.
- I got it from the Department of Education.

304
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:42,721
Abby, look, I don't know exactly
what this means, but it could be important.

305
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:46,270
I spoke to our man in custody.

306
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:51,189
All he gave us was
a province in the Ukraine. Smila.

307
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:53,987
I sent a team there
to search for Derevko's headquarters.

308
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:56,829
- So far they've found nothing.
- When do you leave for Tokyo?

309
00:24:56,913 --> 00:25:00,863
I leave in one hour.
I need you to help me, Jack.

310
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:03,580
I need you to get Richter to talk,

311
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:07,620
to tell us exactly where in Smila
we can find Derevko's centre of operations.

312
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:13,339
If I go to Japan without
something tangible, something valuable,

313
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,968
I don't know what the Alliance might do.

314
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:27,100
It doesn't have to end this way.
You could be made very comfortable.

315
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:31,238
- All you have to do is give us an address.
- Smila.

316
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:37,076
Yes, in the Ukraine. Where in Smila?
All we need is an address.

317
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:43,626
Just tell me
where the hell Derevko's operation is.

318
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:49,962
You give me an address now, you son
of a bitch. Where in Smila do we look?

319
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:56,797
Smila...

320
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,633
Smila is my wife.

321
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:09,025
And I love her.

322
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,358
I love her so much.

323
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:16,237
Just kill him.

324
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:25,669
Said 1982, right?

325
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:29,619
There's a serial number, FYB 55L.

326
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:31,790
Popular test.

327
00:26:31,883 --> 00:26:35,382
- "Popular"?
- I got a call once from someone at ETS,

328
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,926
said they were centralising their files.

329
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:41,051
They wanted any originals.

330
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:48,392
Can you remember if you put in
any questions about spatial reasoning?

331
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:52,812
Why would I do that? There's
no statistical utility in asking questions

332
00:26:52,904 --> 00:26:55,442
maybe one in 10,000 first-graders
could answer.

333
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:58,782
Well, how would you explain
a question like this, then?

334
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:04,207
"How can rainbows be seen
only when the sun is behind the observer?"

335
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:08,074
This wasn't in the test I sent to ETS.

336
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:13,674
I design the questions.
I proof the test booklets they print up,

337
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:18,504
and then when they send the final
corrected copies, I put 'em on file.

338
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:21,266
About how many first-graders
took this test?

339
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:24,552
They administered this in 33 states.

340
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:29,231
That's over five million children.

341
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,109
Sloane's on his way to Japan.

342
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:36,440
He plans to stay at
a yakuza-run ryokan, the Nayoshi Ginza.

343
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:38,773
Use the numbers he gave you
and contact Sark.

344
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:44,572
Tell him we will hand him Sloane
the night before his Alliance meeting.

345
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:48,911
Tell me you agree with me,
that we have no choice in this.

346
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:51,493
Of course we have a choice.

347
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:58,460
And it's a moment I never
wanted you to face. To kill someone.

348
00:27:58,553 --> 00:28:03,796
I'm not talking about self-defence.
I'm talking about premeditated murder.

349
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:07,308
To be there when the door
closes on him for the last time,

350
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:10,313
knowing you are responsible.

351
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:12,605
That is something
you never came close to considering

352
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:15,527
before getting to know your mother.

353
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:40,251
- I'm on the grounds.
- Good.

354
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:42,966
My associate's just arrived
to meet your father.

355
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:54,516
- Is that the antidote?
- Yes. But the briefcase is security-coded

356
00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:57,396
with a secondary system
wired to a remote detonator.

357
00:28:57,487 --> 00:29:01,022
- As I expected.
- Only Mr Sark has the security code.

358
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:07,913
Until I receive word from him to release
the serum, the case remains closed.

359
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:46,361
- Approaching the building.
- Good luck, Sydney.

360
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:49,074
I don't need you to wish me luck,
you son of a bitch.

361
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:50,492
That's a wonderful attitude.

362
00:31:42,235 --> 00:31:44,808
God, I'm tense.

363
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:48,814
Not a big surprise.

364
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:52,776
I saw a man die yesterday.

365
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:57,954
Do you understand?

366
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:05,839
Yeah.

367
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:11,680
He was in incredible pain.

368
00:32:13,183 --> 00:32:18,390
But it was the love he had for his wife
that sustained him.

369
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:27,445
I loved my wife, too.

370
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,986
But I had to take action.

371
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:44,372
You're so good, do you know that?
Send the ambulance.

372
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,688
All went well. Look, when I said
"good luck" before, I wasn't mocking you.

373
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:05,059
Call in for your man to release the serum.

374
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:14,779
Hand over the antidote.
The security code is 10-11-92.

375
00:33:23,753 --> 00:33:27,169
You'll stay here until we've tested it.

376
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:34,001
It was nice working with you.

377
00:34:28,276 --> 00:34:31,977
- What's happening?
- You've been asleep for 40 hours.

378
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:34,942
- Am I dying?
- Almost.

379
00:34:36,368 --> 00:34:38,941
Sydney got the antidote.

380
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:42,665
The doctors say
your blood levels are looking good.

381
00:34:42,749 --> 00:34:46,581
- How did she do it?
- She had Sloane killed.

382
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:57,298
It was only one hour ago

383
00:34:58,598 --> 00:35:02,049
It was all so different then

384
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:13,356
Cos nothing yet has really sunk in

385
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:18,690
Looks like it always did

386
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:29,412
This flesh and bone

387
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:36,709
Is just the way that you were tied in

388
00:35:40,056 --> 00:35:45,513
Now there's no one home

389
00:35:45,603 --> 00:35:48,308
Sydney.

390
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:51,731
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

391
00:35:52,861 --> 00:35:55,149
You know Mr Sark.

392
00:35:56,197 --> 00:35:59,115
I don't think
we've ever been officially introduced.

393
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,489
Mr Sark is now cooperating with us

394
00:36:01,578 --> 00:36:04,579
in our ongoing search for Derevko
and the remains of her company.

395
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:10,003
- He's cooperating?
- This is a strategic alliance, Agent Bristow.

396
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:13,538
Debrief him. Take down
everything he knows about Derevko,

397
00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:18,377
and we'll see and decide
about what goes on after that.

398
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:22,928
It's so hard to move on

399
00:36:27,645 --> 00:36:30,979
Still loving what's gone

400
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:34,269
Agent Bristow, working with you w...

401
00:36:37,405 --> 00:36:40,192
Don't worry. I pulsed the bugs.

402
00:36:40,283 --> 00:36:44,067
- We can reminisce.
- What are you doing here? How...?

403
00:36:44,162 --> 00:36:48,705
I took the ambulance to a remote location,
and then I revived him.

404
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:53,288
Here's the situation:
Rambaldi's true aim is a puzzle.

405
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,787
I have certain pieces, you have others.

406
00:36:55,882 --> 00:37:00,378
Separately we'll never solve his mystery,
but together, we cannot fail.

407
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,008
How do I know you have
anything real to offer?

408
00:37:03,098 --> 00:37:05,885
I can prove myself in two ways.

409
00:37:05,975 --> 00:37:09,060
The first is obvious:
I intercepted communications

410
00:37:09,145 --> 00:37:13,357
indicating that there would be
an assassination attempt on your life.

411
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:18,566
As this conversation proves,
I've prevented that.

412
00:37:18,655 --> 00:37:21,407
How do I know you didn't plan the attempt
in the first place?

413
00:37:21,491 --> 00:37:25,868
Which brings me
to my second piece of information.

414
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:40,917
- What was on the piece of paper?
- I'm afraid that's need-to-know.

415
00:37:48,643 --> 00:37:51,134
I got it from here. Thanks.

416
00:38:17,255 --> 00:38:22,760
You asked me some questions. I told you
I'd answer them if you helped me.

417
00:38:22,844 --> 00:38:25,169
You did help me,

418
00:38:26,222 --> 00:38:28,298
and I thank you for that.

419
00:38:28,391 --> 00:38:31,262
I didn't do it for you.

420
00:38:40,278 --> 00:38:42,816
I'm trying to live a normal life,

421
00:38:43,865 --> 00:38:47,199
which was always hard, given what I do.

422
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:53,498
But it's gotten harder
since I've met your daughter.

423
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:58,957
It's not that knowing her
hasn't made my life better.

424
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:02,545
It has.

425
00:39:03,593 --> 00:39:06,796
But it's also made it that much worse.

426
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,016
- I think I've said enough.
- The problem, Mr Vaughn,

427
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:18,647
is that to the one person who matters,

428
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:20,809
you haven't said anything.

429
00:39:20,902 --> 00:39:23,108
Listen, this may not mean anything to you,

430
00:39:23,196 --> 00:39:26,316
this may not be something you understand
or appreciate, but we have rules.

431
00:39:26,408 --> 00:39:28,863
Very clear and important rules
that govern the relationship

432
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:31,110
between a handler and his asset.

433
00:39:31,204 --> 00:39:35,284
And between a man and a woman?

434
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:38,162
Come to me now

435
00:39:40,463 --> 00:39:43,464
And lay your hands over me

436
00:39:45,677 --> 00:39:50,173
Even if it's a lie,
say it will be all right

437
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:52,550
Hi.

438
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:54,641
Hi.

439
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:58,894
I'm broken in two

440
00:40:01,651 --> 00:40:04,901
And I know you're on to me

441
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:09,739
Thank you.

442
00:40:09,826 --> 00:40:12,447
When I'm so all alone

443
00:40:12,537 --> 00:40:16,202
But I do believe

444
00:40:18,376 --> 00:40:24,046
That not everything is gonna be
the way you think it oughta be

445
00:40:24,132 --> 00:40:26,457
I heard about Sark.

446
00:40:26,551 --> 00:40:32,589
Sloane actually brought Sark to the
Alliance, presented him as their new ally.

447
00:40:32,682 --> 00:40:36,632
- How did that go over?
- Apparently Sark was a big hit.

448
00:40:36,728 --> 00:40:41,271
And thanks to me, Sloane's standing
has never been higher.

449
00:40:41,858 --> 00:40:44,776
I shall believe

450
00:40:48,073 --> 00:40:50,943
I understand you met Alice.

451
00:40:52,494 --> 00:40:56,408
- She seems nice.
- Yeah. She is.

452
00:40:56,915 --> 00:41:02,585
She's a good person. We have a lot
of history. We're trying to, you know...

453
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:05,340
- We broke up.
- Yeah, you'd mentioned that.

454
00:41:05,423 --> 00:41:08,258
A couple of months later
we saw each other at a friend's, and...

455
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:11,712
- You don't have to explain.
- No, I know, but I want to,

456
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:14,378
because if things
were the other way around...

457
00:41:14,474 --> 00:41:16,763
Seriously.

458
00:41:18,937 --> 00:41:21,428
Don't explain.

459
00:41:24,275 --> 00:41:26,766
I shall believe

460
00:41:29,197 --> 00:41:31,688
I'll see you tomorrow.

461
00:41:43,712 --> 00:41:49,133
Jack briefed me. He and Sydney broke
protocol, but I'm glad it worked out.

462
00:41:49,217 --> 00:41:51,293
Excuse me.

463
00:41:51,386 --> 00:41:56,807
That not everything is gonna be
the way you think it oughta be

464
00:41:56,891 --> 00:42:01,849
It seems like every time I try
to make it right, it all comes down on me

465
00:42:01,938 --> 00:42:07,774
Please say honestly
you won't give up on me

466
00:42:09,404 --> 00:42:12,987
And I shall believe

467
00:42:14,743 --> 00:42:17,697
I shall believe

468
00:42:20,165 --> 00:42:23,082
I shall believe

469
00:42:25,295 --> 00:42:28,212
I shall believe
