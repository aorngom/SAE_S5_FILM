1
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,207
Have you ever felt that
someone's your soul mate?

2
00:08:43,472 --> 00:08:45,180
You're a good guy,
you don't want to hurt anybody,

3
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:48,053
but you're guaranteed
you're gonna hurt everybody.

4
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,722
What are you talking about?

5
00:08:50,813 --> 00:08:53,730
- I really don't know.
- That's helpful advice.

6
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:54,979
If you think I'm gonna tell you

7
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,063
to stay
in a loveless marriage...

8
00:08:56,152 --> 00:08:57,231
It's not a loveless marriage.

9
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:58,814
Whatever. And if you're
waiting for me to tell you

10
00:08:58,904 --> 00:09:00,067
to leave your wife
for another woman,

11
00:09:00,156 --> 00:09:01,354
you can forget about that, too.

12
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:05,072
Do you think you can be
in love with two people

13
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:06,026
at the same time?

14
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,614
No, I don't.

15
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:11,122
However, I did have
the same intense feelings

16
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,415
for both Sporty and Posh Spice.

17
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,378
Yeah, who didn't?

18
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,467
Come in.

19
00:09:24,555 --> 00:09:25,634
I found your size.

20
00:09:25,723 --> 00:09:27,715
Great.
Thank you.

21
00:09:27,808 --> 00:09:31,058
Do you have something similar
in black, maybe with some lace?

22
00:09:31,145 --> 00:09:32,639
Thanks.

23
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,818
Come in.

24
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:49,201
I must say, you're quite
an impressive actress.

25
00:09:49,705 --> 00:09:51,365
When I approached you
in the parking garage,

26
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:52,832
even I didn't realise you and I

27
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:55,123
were working
for the same organisation.

28
00:09:58,047 --> 00:10:00,170
Would you like to put
something on?

29
00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:03,000
No, I'm rather comfortable
like this.

30
00:10:03,094 --> 00:10:04,802
Would you like me
to put something on?

31
00:10:04,887 --> 00:10:06,465
Hardly.

32
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,427
You and I share
a similar predicament.

33
00:10:10,851 --> 00:10:12,132
The Covenant.

34
00:10:12,228 --> 00:10:14,055
We're expected
to carry out orders

35
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:17,895
without knowing exactly
how or why we're doing so.

36
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:20,150
Hence the death of my father.

37
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,315
At your hand.

38
00:10:24,407 --> 00:10:26,316
You were given
and carried out orders

39
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:28,069
without question.

40
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,868
Not that my father
deserved to live.

41
00:10:29,954 --> 00:10:30,867
He didn't.

42
00:10:30,955 --> 00:10:33,872
It's just that I'm bankrolling
this entire operation

43
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,247
while being treated like
a worthless foot soldier.

44
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,127
Why are you coming to me
with this?

45
00:10:38,212 --> 00:10:40,370
Because since I've learned
of your true affiliation,

46
00:10:40,464 --> 00:10:42,671
I've studied up on you.

47
00:10:42,758 --> 00:10:44,751
Your history.

48
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,967
Your skills.

49
00:10:47,054 --> 00:10:48,881
Your connections.

50
00:10:51,225 --> 00:10:53,846
I also like your perfume.

51
00:10:53,936 --> 00:10:55,181
What do you want?

52
00:10:55,271 --> 00:10:57,180
To stage a coup.

53
00:10:57,815 --> 00:10:59,689
I know of three cell leaders.

54
00:10:59,775 --> 00:11:02,183
I believe you know
the other three.

55
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:05,067
I propose we eliminate them all.

56
00:11:10,494 --> 00:11:11,657
Look at this.

57
00:11:11,746 --> 00:11:14,782
It must be your lucky day.

58
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:18,325
Actually, I believe
it's my lucky day.

59
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,674
Once we eliminate
all six cell leaders,

60
00:11:26,761 --> 00:11:28,136
we'll travel to St. Petersburg

61
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,213
to meet with the head
of Covenant operations.

62
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:31,930
Why, to make it easier
for him to kill us?

63
00:11:32,016 --> 00:11:34,174
On the contrary.

64
00:11:34,268 --> 00:11:37,020
Each cell leader wears
a watch containing access keys

65
00:11:37,104 --> 00:11:39,311
to their respective
headquarters.

66
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:41,307
Once we have all six keys,

67
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,144
we'll force our ascension
within The Covenant,

68
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:46,189
under threat
that if they don't comply,

69
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,566
the keys will be handed
over to the CIA.

70
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,821
Which colour do you think
my husband would prefer?

71
00:11:58,292 --> 00:12:00,783
I prefer the black.

72
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,830
Red it is.

73
00:12:52,888 --> 00:12:53,837
Dad.

74
00:12:53,931 --> 00:12:57,430
I thought we might talk business
over dinner.

75
00:13:01,731 --> 00:13:02,726
We've got a lock on Cummings.

76
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:05,520
She's operating out of
a high-end club in Athens.

77
00:13:05,609 --> 00:13:08,361
You're going in as South-African
diamond smugglers.

78
00:13:08,446 --> 00:13:09,608
You've heard of her work,

79
00:13:09,697 --> 00:13:11,820
want her to upgrade
your Cape Town facility.

80
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:13,152
How about we just
tell her we're CIA

81
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:14,570
and want to ask her
some questions?

82
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,985
We believe Cummings
designed the security system.

83
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:18,953
We're not 100%.

84
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,949
We need to confirm her work
in Chamonix first,

85
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:22,833
then persuade her
to detail the countermeasures

86
00:13:22,918 --> 00:13:24,329
she put in place at the chalet.

87
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,535
They're prepping
the mission now.

88
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:28,583
Dixon will be contacting you
within the hour.

89
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,085
I expect Vaughn
will be going with you.

90
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,255
Yeah, I figured.

91
00:13:36,891 --> 00:13:38,349
You realise
it is your prerogative

92
00:13:38,434 --> 00:13:40,759
to ask Dixon
to send someone else.

93
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,973
If Dixon sends me
on an operation, I'm going.

94
00:13:44,065 --> 00:13:47,101
What I mean is,
someone instead of Vaughn.

95
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,857
I'd be more
comfortable going with Weiss.

96
00:13:55,951 --> 00:13:58,277
The contacts, the ones
used to locate Cummings,

97
00:13:58,371 --> 00:13:59,284
Weiss cultivated them

98
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:02,491
while working a Pan-African
smuggling operation.

99
00:14:06,087 --> 00:14:08,412
I'll call him in,
have him meet you in tac-ops.

100
00:14:08,506 --> 00:14:10,000
Thank you.

101
00:14:19,642 --> 00:14:25,347
The deficit must remain
below 3% of GNP.

102
00:14:25,439 --> 00:14:26,768
Yes, Robert.

103
00:14:26,857 --> 00:14:30,107
Well, of course.
You shall see the figures.

104
00:14:30,194 --> 00:14:32,068
You're on.

105
00:14:32,154 --> 00:14:33,565
Well, absolutely.

106
00:14:33,656 --> 00:14:35,779
No, there is now no question.

107
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:41,819
Robert, would you mind terribly
if I call you later?

108
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,039
Thank you.

109
00:14:46,127 --> 00:14:49,578
Mr. Gathird, Lauren Reed.

110
00:14:49,672 --> 00:14:51,047
We met before in London.

111
00:14:51,882 --> 00:14:54,634
Of course, Ms. Reed.

112
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,374
What are you doing here?

113
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:00,338
There is something I was hoping
we might be able to discuss.

114
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:03,967
And only a man of your position
within The Covenant can help me.

115
00:15:04,061 --> 00:15:06,683
Still, there are protocols.

116
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:10,437
You didn't worry about protocols
the last time we spoke.

117
00:15:13,654 --> 00:15:16,608
I'll meet you gentlemen
upstairs.

118
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,119
I need your counsel.

119
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,793
The CIA's aware there's
a mole in their organisation,

120
00:15:28,878 --> 00:15:33,456
and I'm feeling vulnerable.

121
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:36,420
Why come to me?

122
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,969
Well, you said
the last time we spoke

123
00:15:38,054 --> 00:15:40,545
that if I ever needed
anything...

124
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:43,052
I need your help.

125
00:15:48,397 --> 00:15:49,891
Do you have a minute?

126
00:16:57,842 --> 00:17:01,127
You know,
you're unbelievably good.

127
00:17:05,433 --> 00:17:08,636
Come on. Our flight
to Paris leaves in an hour.

128
00:17:09,603 --> 00:17:10,884
Yes.

129
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,138
Yes, it does.

130
00:17:28,164 --> 00:17:29,326
There she is.

131
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,613
Can I help you?

132
00:17:32,209 --> 00:17:34,747
Tell Ms. Cummings
her clients are here.

133
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,678
You are sweet, darling.

134
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:52,844
Sit down.

135
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:55,061
John Steadman.
This is Rebecca Davison.

136
00:17:56,484 --> 00:17:57,764
A pleasure.

137
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,185
I prefer not to shake hands.

138
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,070
Sit down.

139
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,942
You want to secure
a facility in Cape Town?

140
00:18:06,035 --> 00:18:07,862
Yes, a diamond-processing plant.

141
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,448
We've had trouble
with break-ins.

142
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:12,409
The political situation
there is unstable.

143
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,745
They say we're
stripping their land

144
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:16,290
of its natural resources,
but honestly,

145
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:18,751
do you think God intended
this kind of beauty

146
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:20,998
to be wasted in the ground?

147
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,506
Whether we end up
working together or not,

148
00:18:24,595 --> 00:18:26,967
do me a favour, huh?

149
00:18:27,056 --> 00:18:29,132
Don't talk to me about God.

150
00:18:29,225 --> 00:18:31,217
What did God intend?

151
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,137
Hell if I know.

152
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:35,352
Not a clue.

153
00:18:36,065 --> 00:18:37,227
My work is good.

154
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:38,395
Yes, we know.

155
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:39,599
We're very interested

156
00:18:39,694 --> 00:18:43,193
in one of your lethal
response systems.

157
00:18:44,407 --> 00:18:47,941
What you're asking me to do
is illegal in most countries.

158
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,451
So, Mr. Steadman.

159
00:18:52,123 --> 00:18:53,581
Give me one good reason

160
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:57,498
why I would ever
risk my ass for you.

161
00:18:57,586 --> 00:19:00,077
I believe we can give you
2 million reasons.

162
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:13,216
Well, looks like y'all
don't need an ATM.

163
00:19:16,814 --> 00:19:18,807
So, what did you kids
have in mind?

164
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:21,817
Something like the system
you built in Chamonix.

165
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,734
And how do two
South-African rock wranglers

166
00:19:26,824 --> 00:19:28,982
hear about Chamonix?

167
00:19:29,076 --> 00:19:30,820
The owner is a client.

168
00:19:38,627 --> 00:19:40,086
Yeah.

169
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:42,543
I outdid myself on that one.

170
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:45,467
But if you're interested
in a job like that,

171
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:48,754
those stones won't even
cover the down payment.

172
00:19:48,846 --> 00:19:51,551
They barely cover
this conversation.

173
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,677
Well, then I have
a counteroffer.

174
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:56,393
Really?

175
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,477
Show us the schematics
for what you built in Chamonix.

176
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,278
Tell us how to bypass
the system.

177
00:20:06,364 --> 00:20:07,941
In exchange, we will make sure

178
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:09,609
you're treated well
while in custody.

179
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,444
You're smart enough
to know the CIA

180
00:20:11,535 --> 00:20:12,946
has big, wide, comfy cells

181
00:20:13,037 --> 00:20:15,742
with hot water,
cotton sheets, and TV.

182
00:20:15,831 --> 00:20:18,073
We also have cramped,
cold, little cells

183
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:20,124
with a bare cot
and a hole in the floor.

184
00:20:20,211 --> 00:20:23,247
See, either way,
you're coming home with us.

185
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:25,213
Where you live is up to you.

186
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:32,762
There is no bypassing
the system.

187
00:20:32,848 --> 00:20:34,093
Okay, Cummings told you

188
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:35,804
the chalet
is virtually impenetrable.

189
00:20:35,893 --> 00:20:38,051
They've got three tiers of
tree-mounted security cameras,

190
00:20:38,145 --> 00:20:40,932
plus there's military-trained
guards that patrol.

191
00:20:41,023 --> 00:20:42,221
We need to find some way in.

192
00:20:42,316 --> 00:20:44,356
The Doleac Agenda could mean
the end of The Covenant.

193
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,685
I said virtually impenetrable.

194
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:49,448
Now, the lethal response
system Toni Cummings built

195
00:20:49,532 --> 00:20:51,192
is in a half-mile-long tunnel,

196
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,953
and that'll serve as our way
into the chalet.

197
00:20:54,745 --> 00:20:56,287
According to the schematic
she gave us,

198
00:20:56,372 --> 00:20:59,326
the lethal response system
is comprised of three zones.

199
00:20:59,417 --> 00:21:00,911
You've got your
automated sentry guns,

200
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:02,745
electrified zone,
and the big finish,

201
00:21:02,837 --> 00:21:04,497
motion-triggered acid spray.

202
00:21:04,588 --> 00:21:05,668
So how do we get through?

203
00:21:05,756 --> 00:21:07,963
- Well, what I'm thinking...
- We.

204
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,375
I'm sorry.
We.

205
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,462
She was very helpful
in creating...

206
00:21:12,555 --> 00:21:15,390
In fact,
she's always very helpful.

207
00:21:16,183 --> 00:21:17,346
Inflatable Kevlar.

208
00:21:17,435 --> 00:21:19,474
Now, when you hit the first
tunnel, you toss it in.

209
00:21:19,562 --> 00:21:21,222
The guns will open fire,

210
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,306
but the ball will keep
moving, which means the guns

211
00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:27,183
are gonna keep firing until
they're out of ammunition.

212
00:21:27,278 --> 00:21:28,902
Now you're
at the electrified zone.

213
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:31,989
Cummings armed the tunnel
with 150,000 volts,

214
00:21:32,074 --> 00:21:33,866
which will be
a 15 on this metre.

215
00:21:33,951 --> 00:21:36,193
You want to
double-check it there.

216
00:21:36,287 --> 00:21:37,698
The Neoprene layer
you will be wearing

217
00:21:37,788 --> 00:21:40,540
will protect you,
even if this clocks in at 25.

218
00:21:40,624 --> 00:21:42,831
- And the acid bath?
- We're working on that.

219
00:21:42,918 --> 00:21:44,377
And we need to figure out a way

220
00:21:44,462 --> 00:21:45,872
to get around
the alarm diagnostics.

221
00:21:45,963 --> 00:21:47,588
- Right.
- Ow!

222
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:49,465
- What?
- God.

223
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,875
- I'm sorry. The baby's kicking.
- Really?

224
00:21:51,969 --> 00:21:55,587
He or she is usually pretty
inactive at this time.

225
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:58,350
You keep track
of when the baby kicks?

226
00:21:58,434 --> 00:22:00,343
- Carrie, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

227
00:22:00,436 --> 00:22:01,551
The baby's kicking.

228
00:22:01,645 --> 00:22:02,760
I'm good.

229
00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:47,979
Hello?

230
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:50,309
Jack, it's Arvin.

231
00:22:50,403 --> 00:22:54,566
When you suggested
I see a therapist

232
00:22:54,657 --> 00:22:57,112
perhaps you were right.

233
00:23:17,805 --> 00:23:19,596
I'm supposed to say
something important?

234
00:23:19,682 --> 00:23:22,089
You can say anything.

235
00:23:24,061 --> 00:23:25,935
You're far more attractive
than I imagined.

236
00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:27,564
What did you imagine?

237
00:23:27,648 --> 00:23:29,475
I checked up on you.

238
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:32,603
Yale, Columbia,

239
00:23:32,695 --> 00:23:36,775
prestigious internship
at Mass General.

240
00:23:36,866 --> 00:23:38,858
And then you end up as a GS-18

241
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:41,656
buried in some cubicle
at Langley.

242
00:23:42,705 --> 00:23:45,030
Well, I wanted
to serve my country.

243
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:48,291
And I found that people
who worked in intelligence

244
00:23:48,377 --> 00:23:50,951
had to grapple
with some serious issues.

245
00:23:51,047 --> 00:23:53,372
Living duplicitous lives,

246
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:55,873
compartmentalizing
the personal and professional.

247
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:58,293
It's a difficult challenge.

248
00:23:59,513 --> 00:24:02,799
I presume that you treated
Sydney and Jack Bristow before.

249
00:24:02,892 --> 00:24:04,849
I can't discuss
other patients with you.

250
00:24:04,935 --> 00:24:06,975
Then they were your patients.

251
00:24:10,399 --> 00:24:14,479
I am not here to play games
with you, Mr. Sloane.

252
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:18,402
Dr. Barnett, how can we possibly
have an honest conversation

253
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:21,527
if we can't talk about the most
important people in my life?

254
00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:23,861
You can talk about them.

255
00:24:33,923 --> 00:24:36,378
I'm sorry you came so far,
Dr. Barnett.

256
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:42,505
I can stay as long as it takes.

257
00:24:42,598 --> 00:24:43,843
We can just sit here

258
00:24:43,933 --> 00:24:45,925
until you feel
more comfortable talking.

259
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:47,927
I'm afraid that day
will never come.

260
00:24:51,315 --> 00:24:55,728
Well, I will be staying
in Zurich for two more days.

261
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,488
I urge you to consider

262
00:24:59,573 --> 00:25:02,064
that after I return
to the States,

263
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,282
you'll still be feeling
whatever it is

264
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,947
that you were compelled
to call me here for

265
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:08,078
in the first place.

266
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:11,743
Here's my number.

267
00:25:11,836 --> 00:25:14,042
If you change your mind.

268
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:27,098
We just received intel
that 12 hours ago,

269
00:25:27,184 --> 00:25:29,806
Johannes Gathird, the Executive
Director of the Dryden Bank,

270
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:32,517
was murdered in the garage
of his Berlin office.

271
00:25:32,606 --> 00:25:34,599
Gerard Kronish,
CFO of Chantre Telecom,

272
00:25:34,692 --> 00:25:36,483
was found dead in Paris
40 minutes ago.

273
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:38,146
The confirmed intel
suggests that both

274
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:39,815
were high-ranking members
of The Covenant.

275
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,697
They must know we're after
the Doleac Agenda.

276
00:25:41,782 --> 00:25:42,861
They're killing
the names off the list

277
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,658
before we can get to them.

278
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:48,570
Hi. Is it true you're
moving up the timetable

279
00:25:48,664 --> 00:25:49,530
on the mission to the Alps?

280
00:25:49,623 --> 00:25:50,655
Yes, we're discussing that now.

281
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,541
Sydney and Vaughn,
there's a plane waiting

282
00:25:52,626 --> 00:25:54,251
to take you back to Chamonix.

283
00:25:54,336 --> 00:25:55,665
The override I'm building

284
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:57,747
to bypass
the lethal response system...

285
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,299
Haven't quite cracked it yet.

286
00:25:59,383 --> 00:26:00,130
How long do you need?

287
00:26:00,217 --> 00:26:03,384
Well, assuming I'm a genius,
six hours.

288
00:26:03,471 --> 00:26:04,585
Can it work remotely?

289
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,136
Yeah, I don't see why not,
but it would require someone

290
00:26:07,224 --> 00:26:08,505
to execute an uplink
in Chamonix.

291
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:10,889
Jack, you'll go with them
and handle the uplink.

292
00:26:10,978 --> 00:26:13,267
The three of you,
wheels up in 15 minutes.

293
00:26:22,573 --> 00:26:24,447
Comms and encryption
synchronised?

294
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:26,028
High-band protocol.

295
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:28,740
Marshall tweaked them
so there's no delay.

296
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:39,877
I know you requested Weiss
for the last mission.

297
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,175
I understand.

298
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:51,972
Every day I wish I could go
back in time.

299
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:53,970
But I can't.

300
00:26:55,689 --> 00:26:58,441
And as much as I...

301
00:27:00,403 --> 00:27:05,645
As much as I still
have feelings for you

302
00:27:05,741 --> 00:27:08,446
I won't be the other woman.

303
00:27:08,536 --> 00:27:10,445
Not ever.

304
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:13,156
I know.

305
00:27:16,794 --> 00:27:18,751
According to Lisenker,

306
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:21,625
the Doleac Agenda is hidden
in the wine cellar.

307
00:27:21,716 --> 00:27:22,961
It's encrypted on a microdot

308
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,509
that Lisenker injected
into the cork

309
00:27:24,593 --> 00:27:27,760
of a bottle of Chateau Margot,
vintage 1953.

310
00:27:32,935 --> 00:27:35,391
Chateau Margot '53.
Got it.

311
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:48,610
- Hello?
- Hi.

312
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:50,907
Michael, where are you?

313
00:27:50,995 --> 00:27:52,157
Or can't you say?

314
00:27:52,246 --> 00:27:54,369
I'll be out of town
for a day or so.

315
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:57,367
Are you alright?

316
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,740
I just miss you.

317
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:03,085
When you get back,
I'll make you some dinner.

318
00:28:03,174 --> 00:28:05,297
Something delicious.

319
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:06,463
It's a date.

320
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:08,094
Be safe, love.

321
00:28:48,177 --> 00:28:49,457
Watchtower's in position.

322
00:28:52,807 --> 00:28:54,799
Copy that.
How's our position?

323
00:28:54,892 --> 00:28:56,090
You look clear.

324
00:28:57,812 --> 00:28:59,270
Establishing uplink.

325
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:21,667
Base Camp, I've established
a laser link

326
00:29:21,752 --> 00:29:22,666
to the security server.

327
00:29:22,753 --> 00:29:24,829
- Are you receiving the signal?
- Uplink is 5x5.

328
00:29:24,922 --> 00:29:28,671
We're tapped into their security
network, and I'm accessing now.

329
00:29:33,806 --> 00:29:35,466
We're in position
at the tunnel entrance.

330
00:29:35,558 --> 00:29:37,349
Copy. You're patched
through to Base Camp.

331
00:29:37,435 --> 00:29:38,929
Okay, you're gonna have
to take each kill zone

332
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:40,478
one at a time,
but don't sweat it,

333
00:29:40,563 --> 00:29:42,520
because you can bet your life
on that gear I gave you.

334
00:29:42,606 --> 00:29:44,646
Well, maybe not your...

335
00:29:44,734 --> 00:29:46,773
My life you can bet.
That's fine.

336
00:29:46,861 --> 00:29:49,019
I'm gonna sever
the kill zone's diagnostics

337
00:29:49,113 --> 00:29:50,062
from the main alarm system

338
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:51,436
so the guards won't know
you're there.

339
00:29:51,532 --> 00:29:52,563
For how long?

340
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:54,318
You'll need to get through
the lethal response system,

341
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:57,779
into the wine cellar,
and back again in five minutes.

342
00:29:57,872 --> 00:30:00,078
Start the clock, Base Camp.

343
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:03,406
Okay, and the five-minute
countdown has been activated.

344
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:06,420
Initiating phase one
of lethal response system.

345
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:12,672
Inflating decoy.

346
00:30:32,198 --> 00:30:34,486
- We've cleared the guns.
- Copy, Mountaineer.

347
00:30:34,575 --> 00:30:37,066
4 minutes and 10 seconds
remaining.

348
00:30:37,161 --> 00:30:38,026
- Marshall?
- Yeah.

349
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,069
- It's time.
- Time for what?

350
00:30:39,163 --> 00:30:41,072
The baby.
I'm having a baby.

351
00:30:41,165 --> 00:30:43,656
Oh, my God.
Okay, don't panic here.

352
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:45,874
We should probably get you
some hot water, a towel...

353
00:30:45,961 --> 00:30:47,504
- No, a hospital.
- Ambulance is on its way.

354
00:30:47,588 --> 00:30:49,628
I don't want to go
till we're married.

355
00:30:50,424 --> 00:30:52,049
You want to get married
to me now?

356
00:30:52,134 --> 00:30:54,210
- Yes.
- You can do it.

357
00:30:54,303 --> 00:30:56,212
You can be certified
online in minutes.

358
00:30:56,305 --> 00:30:58,013
- He can?
- I can?

359
00:30:58,099 --> 00:30:59,344
Base Camp,
Mountaineer and Boy Scout

360
00:30:59,433 --> 00:31:01,592
are at the electrified zone.

361
00:31:01,685 --> 00:31:03,595
- Sign here.
- Marshall?

362
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:06,179
Exalted minister of the Internet
Church of Mammals?

363
00:31:06,273 --> 00:31:08,100
Oh, just sign it,
for the love of God!

364
00:31:08,192 --> 00:31:10,517
Initiating voltage reading.

365
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,819
- The reading's at 50.
- You'll have to abort.

366
00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:17,030
Your suits are not equipped
to handle that much voltage.

367
00:31:17,118 --> 00:31:19,739
500,000 volts.
That's got to be a mistake.

368
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:31,245
You've got three minutes.

369
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:33,715
Stay away from the sides
and the ladder.

370
00:31:33,801 --> 00:31:35,081
Only go down the centre.

371
00:31:35,177 --> 00:31:37,799
Okay, as soon as I hit
the ground, go.

372
00:31:42,685 --> 00:31:45,223
Okay, you have 2 minutes
and 30 seconds, Mountaineer.

373
00:31:49,066 --> 00:31:50,347
Okay, 2 minutes 17.

374
00:31:57,366 --> 00:31:59,158
Syd, stay to the centre.

375
00:32:09,211 --> 00:32:11,121
You okay?

376
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:16,088
I'm okay.

377
00:32:24,685 --> 00:32:25,930
We've cleared the second tunnel.

378
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:26,554
Copy, Mountaineer.

379
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:28,768
Mountaineer,
you've got a minute 45.

380
00:32:28,856 --> 00:32:30,564
Okay, breathe, honey.
Breathe.

381
00:32:31,567 --> 00:32:33,145
Approaching the third
countermeasure.

382
00:32:33,235 --> 00:32:34,730
Acid kill zone.

383
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,362
We're firing the sealant.

384
00:32:40,409 --> 00:32:42,485
Okay, let's move.

385
00:32:42,578 --> 00:32:44,535
Base Camp,
the sealant better hold.

386
00:32:44,622 --> 00:32:46,698
You're good, Mountaineer.

387
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:49,583
Marshall,
do you take this woman

388
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:51,708
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

389
00:32:51,796 --> 00:32:52,460
I do.

390
00:32:52,546 --> 00:32:55,832
And, Carrie,
do you take this man

391
00:32:55,925 --> 00:32:58,167
to be your
lawfully wedded husband?

392
00:32:59,011 --> 00:33:00,126
Take a second.

393
00:33:00,221 --> 00:33:01,419
I do.

394
00:33:01,514 --> 00:33:05,381
Then, by the power vested in me
by the Church of Mammals...

395
00:33:05,476 --> 00:33:07,136
Okay.
Okay.

396
00:33:07,228 --> 00:33:08,259
I got to go to the hospital.

397
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:10,393
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

398
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,139
I love you, Mrs. Flinkman.

399
00:33:12,233 --> 00:33:14,640
- I'm keeping my name!
- Fine.

400
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:16,310
We're at the wine cellar.

401
00:33:16,404 --> 00:33:18,028
You only have a minute left

402
00:33:18,114 --> 00:33:19,442
until the alarm system
is back online.

403
00:33:19,532 --> 00:33:21,939
Oh, and, by the way,
I just got married.

404
00:33:24,829 --> 00:33:26,987
Look for the '53 Chateau Margot.

405
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:30,205
30 seconds.

406
00:33:31,961 --> 00:33:34,000
'59.

407
00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:36,704
'58.

408
00:33:38,175 --> 00:33:39,255
'57.

409
00:33:40,761 --> 00:33:42,303
Got it.

410
00:33:42,388 --> 00:33:44,760
20 seconds.
Mountaineer, report.

411
00:33:56,402 --> 00:33:58,608
Mountaineer, Boy Scout?
Oh, God, get out!

412
00:34:17,506 --> 00:34:18,669
All security teams
have been alerted

413
00:34:18,758 --> 00:34:20,881
to your position, Mountaineer.

414
00:34:31,687 --> 00:34:33,265
Let's go.

415
00:34:33,355 --> 00:34:35,063
Boy Scout and Mountaineer
are clear.

416
00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:36,727
Proceeding to
the rendezvous point.

417
00:34:36,817 --> 00:34:38,193
Copy that.

418
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:39,652
Oh, I got to go.
My wife's having a baby.

419
00:34:39,737 --> 00:34:41,528
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

420
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:56,333
Something you should know.

421
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,255
I spent three years studying you

422
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,416
for my postdoctorate
dissertation.

423
00:35:01,509 --> 00:35:04,000
The agency gave me
complete access

424
00:35:04,095 --> 00:35:06,383
to your files from SD-6.

425
00:35:06,472 --> 00:35:10,173
I know the decisions you made,
the people you killed.

426
00:35:10,267 --> 00:35:12,390
I know what happened
to your wife.

427
00:35:13,813 --> 00:35:18,521
And to some degree,
I understand you, Arvin.

428
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:21,895
And I can help you
if you let me try.

429
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,334
I'll head to Los Angeles.

430
00:35:42,425 --> 00:35:44,298
You go to St. Petersburg
and present our offer

431
00:35:44,385 --> 00:35:46,259
to the head of operations.

432
00:35:46,345 --> 00:35:49,216
When he agrees
to our terms, contact me.

433
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:53,017
You're not worried
that I might fail

434
00:35:53,102 --> 00:35:54,929
to include your role
in this, are you?

435
00:35:57,815 --> 00:35:59,060
Not in the least.

436
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,107
Especially since
I'll be keeping these.

437
00:36:20,796 --> 00:36:23,501
I manipulate people.

438
00:36:23,591 --> 00:36:25,464
I'm good at that,

439
00:36:25,551 --> 00:36:27,294
and I know it.

440
00:36:27,762 --> 00:36:28,793
I lie.

441
00:36:28,888 --> 00:36:31,295
I keep secrets.

442
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:32,968
I divulge only what I must

443
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:35,846
in order to elicit
the reaction I need.

444
00:36:35,936 --> 00:36:41,144
That skill, in part,
is why I'm still alive.

445
00:36:43,486 --> 00:36:44,565
One of those secrets

446
00:36:44,653 --> 00:36:47,987
affects the only two people
I care about in the world.

447
00:36:48,824 --> 00:36:51,031
Sydney and Jack Bristow.

448
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,704
There are many secrets
I enjoy keeping.

449
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:59,075
There is power in secrets
that you keep.

450
00:37:01,003 --> 00:37:02,747
But this one.

451
00:37:05,049 --> 00:37:08,085
Oh, this one wears on me.

452
00:37:08,177 --> 00:37:10,466
It has for many years.

453
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:14,265
It's central
to my very existence.

454
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:17,019
It's who I am.

455
00:37:26,153 --> 00:37:27,564
You were saying?

456
00:37:36,038 --> 00:37:38,245
I appreciate you coming back.

457
00:37:38,332 --> 00:37:39,791
I do.

458
00:37:42,211 --> 00:37:43,836
But I can't do this.

459
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:51,341
It's important.

460
00:37:51,804 --> 00:37:54,093
I think you should leave.

461
00:37:55,391 --> 00:37:57,099
Right now.

462
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,377
Your hair.

463
00:38:26,464 --> 00:38:28,041
That's cool.

464
00:38:31,093 --> 00:38:32,469
You're the man
behind The Covenant?

465
00:38:32,553 --> 00:38:36,467
I'm the man in front of the man.

466
00:38:38,309 --> 00:38:39,684
When'd you cut your hair?

467
00:38:39,769 --> 00:38:41,227
It wasn't a matter of choice.

468
00:38:41,312 --> 00:38:44,763
I was in U.S. custody,
as I thought you were.

469
00:38:44,857 --> 00:38:46,185
When were you released?

470
00:38:47,485 --> 00:38:49,643
That's a good story.

471
00:38:52,114 --> 00:38:53,692
To your hair.

472
00:38:59,663 --> 00:39:01,371
I'll be the senior most
Covenant representative

473
00:39:01,457 --> 00:39:02,620
that you'll be dealing with.

474
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:06,243
Anything you have to say
to the big boss,

475
00:39:06,337 --> 00:39:08,164
you can say to me.

476
00:39:08,756 --> 00:39:10,630
I assume you have
something to say.

477
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:12,923
I've come to make an offer.

478
00:39:13,844 --> 00:39:16,335
Wouldn't by chance
happen to have anything to do

479
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:19,135
with the cell leaders
that you wiped out?

480
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:24,894
It's amazing, the stuff
I know, isn't it?

481
00:39:25,731 --> 00:39:27,640
So, what do you suppose
we do about that?

482
00:39:30,736 --> 00:39:32,444
The fact that you murdered
our cell leaders.

483
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:34,190
I presume you're smart enough
to know

484
00:39:34,281 --> 00:39:38,575
that I was acting in
The Covenant's best interest.

485
00:39:39,829 --> 00:39:43,245
Julian, don't do that.

486
00:39:43,332 --> 00:39:45,408
I can see right now
that you're scared.

487
00:39:45,501 --> 00:39:48,751
But you don't need
to be scared of me.

488
00:39:48,838 --> 00:39:52,041
In fact,
I have a present for you.

489
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:55,673
<i>Voilà.</i>

490
00:39:55,761 --> 00:39:57,421
Look familiar?

491
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:02,933
And also, two more.

492
00:40:06,397 --> 00:40:08,354
Two more after that.

493
00:40:10,484 --> 00:40:13,022
And one last one.

494
00:40:16,657 --> 00:40:18,614
Did I just blow your mind?

495
00:40:31,213 --> 00:40:32,708
See, when you first
pitched your scheme

496
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:36,463
to Miss Reed,
she gave me a call.

497
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,214
Truth of the matter is,

498
00:40:39,305 --> 00:40:42,175
you two had my double
thumbs-up from the get-go.

499
00:40:42,266 --> 00:40:43,262
Why?

500
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:45,557
Because the CIA
is after the Doleac Agenda.

501
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:46,889
Assume they get it.

502
00:40:46,979 --> 00:40:49,268
They will have the names
of the cell leaders.

503
00:40:49,356 --> 00:40:52,192
You just made my life
so much easier,

504
00:40:52,276 --> 00:40:55,028
because now those names
are irrelevant.

505
00:40:58,115 --> 00:41:00,072
A woman after my own heart.

506
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:02,317
Glad to hear that,

507
00:41:02,411 --> 00:41:05,246
'cause you two are gonna
continue working together.

508
00:41:06,082 --> 00:41:08,952
You're gonna be heading up
our new North-American cell.

509
00:41:11,587 --> 00:41:13,995
That sounds just about right.

510
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:15,833
You're cockier than I am.

511
00:41:16,884 --> 00:41:18,841
I love that about you.

512
00:41:21,305 --> 00:41:22,420
Now, of course,

513
00:41:22,515 --> 00:41:25,718
this doesn't absolve you
of your responsibilities

514
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:28,597
working overtime
as an agent for Uncle Sam.

515
00:41:28,687 --> 00:41:30,146
Of course.

516
00:41:30,231 --> 00:41:32,354
But in the meantime,
may I suggest...

517
00:41:32,441 --> 00:41:34,315
And this is just a suggestion.

518
00:41:34,402 --> 00:41:35,682
That you put the kibosh

519
00:41:35,778 --> 00:41:39,692
on your husband's
extracurricular sex-tivities?

520
00:42:22,283 --> 00:42:23,991
Did you hear about Carrie?
She had her baby.

521
00:42:24,076 --> 00:42:26,116
I see what's going on
between you and Michael,

522
00:42:26,203 --> 00:42:27,283
so let me be clear.

523
00:42:29,081 --> 00:42:31,323
Stay the hell away
from my husband.
