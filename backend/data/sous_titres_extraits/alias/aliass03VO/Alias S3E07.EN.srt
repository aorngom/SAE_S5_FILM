1
00:00:01,051 --> 00:00:02,249
<i>Previously on "Alias."</i>

2
00:00:02,343 --> 00:00:03,506
What do you want?

3
00:00:03,595 --> 00:00:06,714
For me to succeed as
a double agent for The Covenant,

4
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:07,755
I'll need your help.

5
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:10,007
Your needs don't concern me.

6
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:14,805
It's good to see you, Julia.

7
00:00:14,898 --> 00:00:16,440
Good to see you, too.

8
00:00:16,524 --> 00:00:18,149
You're being set up.

9
00:00:18,234 --> 00:00:22,861
His daughter, Sydney Bristow,
also CIA, goes by an alias.

10
00:00:22,947 --> 00:00:24,691
Julia Thorne.

11
00:00:24,783 --> 00:00:27,618
It's been 3 weeks since I found
out Sydney murdered Lazarey.

12
00:00:27,702 --> 00:00:29,327
I've been lying to my wife
for three weeks.

13
00:00:29,412 --> 00:00:31,452
You were ordered
not to say anything.

14
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:33,828
She was ordered to find out
who murdered Lazarey.

15
00:00:33,917 --> 00:00:36,918
I'm engaged in preventing her
from doing her job.

16
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,996
And that you're
protecting Sydney.

17
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:40,334
Yeah.

18
00:00:40,423 --> 00:00:41,965
I'm no longer Sloane's handler.

19
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,877
Dixon gave that job
to Sydney Bristow.

20
00:00:43,968 --> 00:00:46,969
Good. That frees you up
to focus on the Lazarey murder.

21
00:00:47,055 --> 00:00:48,335
I spoke to the leasing agent.

22
00:00:48,431 --> 00:00:49,629
According to their records,

23
00:00:49,724 --> 00:00:52,262
this office was leased
a year ago, November 24th.

24
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:54,012
A 4-year lease paid in advance.

25
00:00:54,104 --> 00:00:55,052
Was there a name?

26
00:00:55,146 --> 00:00:56,640
Yes, there was.

27
00:00:56,731 --> 00:00:59,602
I believe she's the person
who killed Lazarey.

28
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:02,230
Her name is Julia Thorne.

29
00:01:41,151 --> 00:01:42,811
Hello?

30
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:49,883
Thank you.

31
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:50,918
Thank you, Doctor.

32
00:02:51,012 --> 00:02:52,672
Good to see you.

33
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,262
I know I haven't been
to group in a while.

34
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,299
That's okay.

35
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:58,848
We have another session tonight.

36
00:02:58,937 --> 00:03:01,392
I actually came here to talk
about something else.

37
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,102
Is it your dreams?

38
00:03:04,192 --> 00:03:05,770
I've heard about
an experimental procedure

39
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,520
used to recover lost memories.

40
00:03:07,612 --> 00:03:08,893
Neurostimulation therapy.

41
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:12,155
Now, Sydney, before we discuss
this, let's give group a chance.

42
00:03:12,242 --> 00:03:15,159
Some of those people have been
in that group for 10 years.

43
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:17,487
None seem to be closer
to finding out what happened.

44
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,288
The point is to accept
what's happened,

45
00:03:19,374 --> 00:03:22,541
that you may never remember,
and free yourself to move on.

46
00:03:22,627 --> 00:03:27,004
With all due respect, you
don't know what it feels like.

47
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,960
You have clearance. I can tell
you that unlike anyone else,

48
00:03:30,051 --> 00:03:33,088
there's a terrorist organisation
trying to find out the one thing

49
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:34,721
that I can't remember.

50
00:03:34,806 --> 00:03:36,799
My point being,
I don't have the luxury

51
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:39,050
of waiting for acceptance.

52
00:03:39,144 --> 00:03:40,852
Come with me.

53
00:03:43,606 --> 00:03:45,184
This is Kenneth Blake.

54
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:49,272
He joined
Central Intelligence in 1981.

55
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,688
He was missing for five years.

56
00:03:52,782 --> 00:03:54,989
Finally turned up
in a South Korean hospital

57
00:03:55,076 --> 00:03:58,077
with severe injuries
and no memory whatsoever.

58
00:03:58,163 --> 00:04:02,374
Blake volunteered for the same
procedure you're asking for.

59
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,831
The procedure was carried out.

60
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,535
Blake learned he'd been

61
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:09,500
in custody of the North Koreans
all that time,

62
00:04:09,591 --> 00:04:13,256
exposed to torture
so intense, so prolonged

63
00:04:13,344 --> 00:04:16,595
that his conscious mind
blacked it out.

64
00:04:16,681 --> 00:04:18,473
The invasive nature
of the surgery

65
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:21,227
Ieft him with permanent
brain damage.

66
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:24,477
You should know, Sydney, that
the National Security Council

67
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:28,147
considers Blake
a successful test case

68
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:31,152
for neurostimulation therapy.

69
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:35,780
I'd consider death as an option
before this procedure.

70
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:01,259
You have been a busy man,
Javier Parez.

71
00:05:02,894 --> 00:05:05,183
Epidemiology lab in Cannes.

72
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,478
Disease-control ministry
in Spain.

73
00:05:07,565 --> 00:05:11,065
Genetic-engineering
facility in Cuba.

74
00:05:11,152 --> 00:05:14,106
Do I turn you over to Cuba,
to Spain, to France?

75
00:05:14,197 --> 00:05:15,775
To me, there is no difference.

76
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:20,408
For you, there is at least
one significant difference.

77
00:05:20,495 --> 00:05:23,911
France and Spain do not
believe in the death penalty.

78
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:30,292
So here's
where we help each other.

79
00:05:32,382 --> 00:05:34,256
You provide me
with a bigger fish.

80
00:05:34,342 --> 00:05:36,916
The people who commission
you, for instance.

81
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:40,760
And I allow you to choose
to whom I place my call.

82
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:43,470
What if I told you I have
information that would be

83
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,311
very interesting
to the Americans

84
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:51,022
regarding a Central Intelligence
agent and a murder?

85
00:05:51,776 --> 00:05:54,777
A CIA agent committing murder.

86
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,814
Hardly newsworthy.

87
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:00,778
It is when it's done on behalf

88
00:06:00,869 --> 00:06:03,620
of an international
terrorist group,

89
00:06:03,705 --> 00:06:06,622
and the target
is a Russian diplomat.

90
00:06:12,714 --> 00:06:13,793
People, listen up.

91
00:06:13,882 --> 00:06:16,005
We've got non-cleared
personnel en route.

92
00:06:16,092 --> 00:06:17,752
Deactivate the wireless network,

93
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,169
and put all secure servers
on lockdown.

94
00:06:20,263 --> 00:06:21,674
I don't want to see anything

95
00:06:21,765 --> 00:06:24,256
more revealing
than a weather map.

96
00:06:26,978 --> 00:06:28,887
Level-3 security
procedures in effect.

97
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,436
All computer monitors
and LCDs on safe mode.

98
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:34,359
Re-routeing the PBX
to administration.

99
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,948
I always knew you were
destined for great things.

100
00:07:24,035 --> 00:07:25,494
Follow me.

101
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:42,792
Mr. Sloane.

102
00:07:42,887 --> 00:07:44,547
Hi.

103
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,557
It's been a while.
A lot has happened.

104
00:07:48,727 --> 00:07:51,099
First you were evil,
now you're good, so you claim.

105
00:07:51,187 --> 00:07:53,180
Not that I don't trust you.

106
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:55,182
How are you?

107
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,563
Very happy to see you, Marshall.

108
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:00,477
Due to the sensitive nature
of the information

109
00:08:00,572 --> 00:08:02,363
Arvin Sloane is about
to present to us,

110
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:05,319
I thought it would be best
if he did so here.

111
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,904
Is everyone here?

112
00:08:06,995 --> 00:08:09,664
Agents Vaughn and Reed are
prepping a separate assignment

113
00:08:09,748 --> 00:08:11,989
under the direction of the NSC.

114
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:15,831
10 hours ago,
I had a meeting with Mr. Sark.

115
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,298
I assume we're here because
The Covenant requires something.

116
00:08:24,179 --> 00:08:26,385
Your new assignment.

117
00:08:27,265 --> 00:08:29,423
It seems The Covenant
is no longer satisfied

118
00:08:29,517 --> 00:08:32,388
with using my organisation
merely as a front

119
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,017
for their illegal activities.

120
00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:37,811
They've now tasked me
an operation.

121
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,692
I presume you know
what a maser is.

122
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:43,234
You mean a microwave laser?

123
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:44,319
Well, yeah.

124
00:08:44,407 --> 00:08:47,077
I mean, you want me to explain?

125
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,781
Marshall, Sloane has no
authority in this room.

126
00:08:49,871 --> 00:08:51,864
Sorry. I didn't mean
to offend you, sir.

127
00:08:51,956 --> 00:08:54,412
I know you're the main --
Do you want me to --

128
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:55,781
Yes.

129
00:08:55,877 --> 00:08:58,997
It's a microwave that gets
focused into a pinpoint beam.

130
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:01,662
Very similar to how light
gets focused into a laser.

131
00:09:01,758 --> 00:09:03,585
Tomorrow night,
I'm scheduled to attend

132
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,799
a charity function hosted
by the Chinese government

133
00:09:05,887 --> 00:09:08,010
at one of their ministries.

134
00:09:08,098 --> 00:09:09,758
The Covenant
has acquired intelligence

135
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:13,598
that China has designed
a working maser unit,

136
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:17,269
the prototype of which
is held there.

137
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,063
China intends to mount
a maser ray

138
00:09:20,151 --> 00:09:22,559
on one of their
defence satellites.

139
00:09:22,654 --> 00:09:25,857
It is an assassination program.

140
00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:27,692
Wait, are you saying
that this weapon

141
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:29,658
is capable of killing
from space?

142
00:09:29,744 --> 00:09:32,496
Pulsed microwaves are capable
of causing tissue damage,

143
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,285
heart failure,
even brain haemorrhaging.

144
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,542
This could make it appear the
victim died from natural causes.

145
00:09:38,628 --> 00:09:40,288
You can imagine
the potential threat

146
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,622
if The Covenant were to acquire
this technology.

147
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:45,551
I've been tasked to steal
the maser's operating system,

148
00:09:45,635 --> 00:09:48,208
which is in the Chinese
Defence Minister's office.

149
00:09:48,304 --> 00:09:50,593
I want Strategic Services
to review your plan,

150
00:09:50,682 --> 00:09:52,425
and I'll assign an agent
to go along.

151
00:09:52,517 --> 00:09:54,973
I presumed
that would be the case.

152
00:09:55,645 --> 00:09:57,139
I propose Sydney accompany me

153
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,017
to the function,
posing as my assistant.

154
00:10:00,108 --> 00:10:02,563
Together we can obtain
the operating system,

155
00:10:02,652 --> 00:10:04,396
corrupt the maser,

156
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:07,737
and pass along the faulty data
to The Covenant.

157
00:10:07,824 --> 00:10:11,074
That is, assuming the CIA

158
00:10:11,161 --> 00:10:13,284
still intends to use me
as a double agent.

159
00:10:13,371 --> 00:10:15,411
Why me?

160
00:10:15,498 --> 00:10:18,036
Because this mission
cannot be done alone.

161
00:10:18,126 --> 00:10:23,832
I will not risk my life unless
I'm going in with the best.

162
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,003
Do you really imagine,

163
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,084
given your history,
that we would ever --

164
00:10:27,177 --> 00:10:28,885
I'll go.

165
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,587
You know I don't trust you,

166
00:10:32,682 --> 00:10:35,683
and that I believe you have an
endgame beyond this operation.

167
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:38,935
But I also know
that if we're caught,

168
00:10:39,022 --> 00:10:40,849
we'll be standing side by side

169
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,684
in front of
a Chinese firing squad,

170
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:48,648
which means this time
our interests are in line.

171
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,614
And if you betray me...

172
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:54,702
I will just kill you myself.

173
00:11:30,532 --> 00:11:32,987
I understand you've been
loaned out to the NSC.

174
00:11:33,076 --> 00:11:34,451
I leave for Mexico in an hour.

175
00:11:34,536 --> 00:11:36,445
Lauren requested me.
She's briefing me en route.

176
00:11:36,538 --> 00:11:38,447
A contact of mine
in Nogales informed me

177
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,950
that Javier Parez

178
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,833
was apprehended
by Mexican authorities.

179
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:44,243
I'm sure you remember him
as part of the team

180
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,164
Sydney infiltrated
several weeks ago.

181
00:11:46,256 --> 00:11:48,663
Yeah, sort of.
He almost killed me.

182
00:11:48,758 --> 00:11:50,252
He's offered
to trade information

183
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,170
to the NSC
in exchange for leniency.

184
00:11:52,262 --> 00:11:53,720
Our problem is this.

185
00:11:53,805 --> 00:11:55,714
He knows about Sydney.

186
00:11:55,807 --> 00:11:58,559
That she murdered Lazarey
under the alias Julia Thorne.

187
00:11:58,643 --> 00:12:00,766
You can imagine the consequences

188
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:03,261
were he to share this
information with your wife.

189
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:06,274
I think you should tell her
that you know the identity

190
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,897
of the man you've been
sent to interview,

191
00:12:08,987 --> 00:12:11,394
and that conflict of interest
requires you both

192
00:12:11,489 --> 00:12:12,770
to remove yourself
from this case.

193
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:15,357
Are you asking me to interfere
with my wife's investigation?

194
00:12:15,452 --> 00:12:16,531
Yes.

195
00:12:16,619 --> 00:12:17,568
No.

196
00:12:17,662 --> 00:12:20,497
I've kept the truth from Lauren
because Dixon ordered me to.

197
00:12:20,582 --> 00:12:22,040
A situation you orchestrated.

198
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,746
You understand the consequences
to Sydney if this leaks.

199
00:12:24,836 --> 00:12:28,122
The NSC will subject her
to invasive brain surgery.

200
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,337
I don't need a lecture
on the risks she faces.

201
00:12:30,425 --> 00:12:31,670
I don't understand
your resistance.

202
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,551
The NSC will send
other operatives.

203
00:12:33,636 --> 00:12:34,834
They're gonna find out.

204
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:37,800
It will provide us the time
to plan our next move.

205
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:40,512
I think it's safe to say I know
my wife better than you do.

206
00:12:40,602 --> 00:12:41,882
I would hope.

207
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:45,679
Lauren may be our best chance
of keeping this information

208
00:12:45,774 --> 00:12:46,520
from the NSC.

209
00:12:46,608 --> 00:12:49,774
And, Mr. Vaughn,
what if you're wrong?

210
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:55,530
It's the latest
in cloaking technology.

211
00:12:55,617 --> 00:12:57,325
It's called optical camouflage.

212
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,569
Now, basically,
if you take a look right here,

213
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:01,287
its surface is covered
in microfilaments,

214
00:13:01,372 --> 00:13:03,910
which interpret the U.V. waves
generated by its surroundings.

215
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,579
Which means that once you drop
it off in the Chinese ministry,

216
00:13:08,671 --> 00:13:11,044
I will be able to
guide it undetected

217
00:13:11,132 --> 00:13:13,291
past the internal
security cameras

218
00:13:13,385 --> 00:13:14,547
to the alarm controls,

219
00:13:14,636 --> 00:13:18,135
which I'll then deactivate
using the internal modem.

220
00:13:19,474 --> 00:13:21,098
So, once you disable the alarms,

221
00:13:21,184 --> 00:13:23,390
I'll be able to access
the minister's office,

222
00:13:23,478 --> 00:13:24,676
where their maser is kept.

223
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:27,606
Once you get to the maser,
you will access the motherboard.

224
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:30,478
And then you will attach this
to the EPROM chip.

225
00:13:30,568 --> 00:13:33,439
Now, press one, and you'll
be connected to me.

226
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:36,447
I will access the maser's
operating system and corrupt it,

227
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:40,482
and then a copy
of the corrupted version

228
00:13:40,578 --> 00:13:41,907
will be stored onto this.

229
00:13:41,996 --> 00:13:44,914
Which I will give to Sloane
to pass on to The Covenant.

230
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:46,375
Right.

231
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:50,704
Actually, where did the car go?

232
00:14:09,107 --> 00:14:11,977
By the way, you look beautiful.

233
00:14:12,068 --> 00:14:14,025
Spare me.

234
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:29,869
I would encourage you
to take my arm

235
00:14:29,961 --> 00:14:32,582
if we're gonna bluff
our way through this.

236
00:14:48,813 --> 00:14:50,473
Ladies.

237
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:00,438
Mr. Sloane, we're honoured
you could attend.

238
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,407
The honour is mine,
Minister Woo.

239
00:15:02,494 --> 00:15:06,076
And this is my executive
assistant, Christina Meyers.

240
00:15:06,164 --> 00:15:06,994
A pleasure.

241
00:15:07,082 --> 00:15:08,410
Pleasure.

242
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:12,212
Your organisation's
compassionate work

243
00:15:12,295 --> 00:15:14,537
is the model of humanitarian
achievement.

244
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:16,754
Thank you.
Thank you.

245
00:15:16,841 --> 00:15:18,633
Miss Meyers,
would you give us a moment?

246
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:20,627
I have a private matter
to discuss.

247
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,096
Certainly.

248
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,849
Your assistant is lovely.

249
00:15:30,271 --> 00:15:33,438
I presume she does
more for you than type.

250
00:15:33,525 --> 00:15:35,980
Our relationship
is strictly professional.

251
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:38,358
Of course.

252
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:26,692
- Hello?
- You're on.

253
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:30,120
Ladies and gentlemen,
start your engines.

254
00:16:34,711 --> 00:16:35,790
Okay.

255
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:37,289
Promise me again
they won't hear it.

256
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,749
The noise output is.04 DBs,
which is inaudible to the ear.

257
00:16:40,842 --> 00:16:43,713
A cockroach thinks louder
than this car.

258
00:16:47,766 --> 00:16:49,639
Looks like a nice party.

259
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,758
Okay.

260
00:16:52,562 --> 00:16:53,760
I'm gonna follow this guy.

261
00:16:53,855 --> 00:16:55,812
Looks like he knows
where he's going.

262
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:57,938
Security.

263
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:05,439
Are you alright?

264
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:08,867
As long as Marshall can
shut down the security system.

265
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:14,537
You know, Sydney,
we should dance.

266
00:17:14,626 --> 00:17:16,499
Like hell.

267
00:17:17,629 --> 00:17:20,879
The minister assumes
we're sleeping together.

268
00:17:20,965 --> 00:17:23,717
Despite my protests,
he remains unconvinced.

269
00:17:23,802 --> 00:17:25,593
I could care less.

270
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,007
Well, neither would I

271
00:17:27,097 --> 00:17:30,014
if he wasn't constantly
looking in my direction.

272
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,769
Normally, I would suggest
that we remain discreet.

273
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:35,639
I think it best we feign
an argument on the dance floor.

274
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,767
That would buy you
sufficient time to slip away.

275
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:41,812
And, Sydney, given the way
you feel about me,

276
00:17:41,903 --> 00:17:44,145
I doubt it would take
much acting on your part.

277
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:47,987
So, my dear, shall we?

278
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,698
We have to get
to the security room.

279
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:58,283
Alright, following him.

280
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,290
Okay.

281
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:03,710
Sorry.

282
00:18:05,927 --> 00:18:08,085
- Hurry up.
- I got to focus.

283
00:18:20,984 --> 00:18:23,771
Marshall, follow that guard.

284
00:18:23,862 --> 00:18:24,811
Turn to the right.

285
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:27,312
I got it.
I got it.

286
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:30,324
Good. He's approaching
the security control room.

287
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:30,944
Hurry.

288
00:18:31,035 --> 00:18:32,695
Pedal to the metal, sir.

289
00:18:35,123 --> 00:18:36,747
Easy.

290
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,877
Piece of cake.

291
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:55,389
Hurry.
Marshall, under the desk.

292
00:18:55,477 --> 00:18:57,268
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

293
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,725
Well done.

294
00:19:00,815 --> 00:19:03,104
Okay, now I will activate
the RF modem

295
00:19:03,193 --> 00:19:05,600
and hack into
the security system.

296
00:19:07,155 --> 00:19:10,738
Okay, alarms are down.
Surveillance is off.

297
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:22,868
Should take them weeks to get
back online, maybe even months.

298
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,603
Hello?

299
00:19:41,189 --> 00:19:42,849
Thank you.

300
00:19:42,941 --> 00:19:45,348
Marshall says the security
system is shut down.

301
00:19:45,443 --> 00:19:49,108
Well, then I propose you make
this fight look real.

302
00:20:10,802 --> 00:20:13,091
Oh, God, it's a boy.

303
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:23,596
Get back in the car.

304
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:45,326
We have them.

305
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,128
The payment will be left
in the confessional

306
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:49,918
of the San Angel Church
as instructed.

307
00:20:50,008 --> 00:20:53,708
Hold them for at least
two hours, then let them go.

308
00:21:48,983 --> 00:21:50,098
Marshall, I'm going in.

309
00:21:50,193 --> 00:21:51,521
Copy, Mountaineer.

310
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:53,022
Security systems are offline.

311
00:21:53,113 --> 00:21:54,655
You're cleared for entry.

312
00:21:54,739 --> 00:21:57,776
Keep your face covered. You
can't afford to be recognised.

313
00:22:24,978 --> 00:22:26,437
Checking for sensors.

314
00:22:26,521 --> 00:22:28,181
We're good.

315
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:49,499
Okay, Marshall,
uplink established.

316
00:22:49,586 --> 00:22:53,500
Copy that, Mountaineer. Give me
two seconds to corrupt the code.

317
00:23:02,015 --> 00:23:04,007
What's the matter?

318
00:23:04,768 --> 00:23:07,804
Security system is back online.
I don't know how they did it.

319
00:23:07,896 --> 00:23:10,813
- Can you get it back offline?
- Give me two seconds.

320
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:17,821
You may have been compromised.

321
00:23:17,906 --> 00:23:19,733
- Get out.
- Marshall, how much longer?

322
00:23:19,824 --> 00:23:20,987
No!
Get out of there now.

323
00:23:21,076 --> 00:23:22,107
How long?

324
00:23:22,202 --> 00:23:24,111
Just give me one minute.

325
00:24:32,856 --> 00:24:33,851
Marshall, are you done?

326
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,609
Yeah.
Go, go, go.

327
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,315
You are very lucky
they let you go.

328
00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:47,612
Crime on the highways
has become an embarrassment.

329
00:24:47,704 --> 00:24:49,495
If you'd like to file a report,

330
00:24:49,581 --> 00:24:52,416
I will see that it receives
the highest priority.

331
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,579
No, thank you.

332
00:24:53,668 --> 00:24:56,289
We'd like to extradite
Mr. Parez as soon as possible.

333
00:24:56,379 --> 00:24:58,288
Very well.

334
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:00,292
This way.

335
00:25:19,736 --> 00:25:22,488
Who else has been to see
Mr. Parez since he arrived?

336
00:25:22,572 --> 00:25:23,402
No one.

337
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:26,989
I am truly sorry you came
this way for nothing.

338
00:25:34,084 --> 00:25:36,242
You'll give this
to The Covenant.

339
00:25:36,336 --> 00:25:39,123
It contains the corrupted copy
of the operating system.

340
00:25:39,214 --> 00:25:41,171
The Covenant will track it
back to the Chinese prototype,

341
00:25:41,257 --> 00:25:43,630
which has also been corrupted.

342
00:25:43,718 --> 00:25:46,388
They won't suspect
that you betrayed them.

343
00:25:46,471 --> 00:25:48,214
I see.

344
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:51,718
I wonder how many times your
handler said something like that

345
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:54,301
before you were about to
give me something like this.

346
00:25:54,396 --> 00:25:57,895
A small object
of tremendous value

347
00:25:57,982 --> 00:26:00,734
that I asked you to steal
for SD-6,

348
00:26:00,819 --> 00:26:02,443
which you then
rendered worthless

349
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:05,695
in order to prevent its
exploitation by The Alliance.

350
00:26:05,782 --> 00:26:07,940
It happened on occasion.

351
00:26:10,995 --> 00:26:13,118
There was a time you trusted me.

352
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:15,993
It was before
I knew who you were.

353
00:26:17,043 --> 00:26:19,368
It was before I knew who I was.

354
00:26:19,462 --> 00:26:21,870
Oh, no, it was
more recent than that.

355
00:26:21,965 --> 00:26:24,088
The day you were found
in Hong Kong.

356
00:26:24,175 --> 00:26:27,675
The day of your resurrection,
as it were.

357
00:26:29,681 --> 00:26:32,551
This letter arrived
at my office.

358
00:26:35,937 --> 00:26:38,510
My analyst confirmed
what I recognised instantly.

359
00:26:38,606 --> 00:26:41,097
What I'm sure you'll verify
on your own.

360
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:44,143
The handwriting is yours.

361
00:26:54,289 --> 00:26:56,614
I've never seen that code
before.

362
00:26:56,708 --> 00:26:58,665
I didn't want to offer it
to anyone else.

363
00:26:58,752 --> 00:27:01,788
Unfortunately, I couldn't
decipher it myself.

364
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,956
Since those items
were in your possession,

365
00:27:04,048 --> 00:27:06,374
I thought you might
want them back.

366
00:27:15,226 --> 00:27:16,602
Let's talk.

367
00:27:16,686 --> 00:27:18,311
Of course.

368
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:25,268
You killed Javier Parez,
you son of a bitch.

369
00:27:25,361 --> 00:27:27,853
You've just returned
from a traumatic experience.

370
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:29,192
You're emotional,

371
00:27:29,282 --> 00:27:31,690
which would explain
your baseless accusation.

372
00:27:31,785 --> 00:27:32,780
I am emotional.

373
00:27:32,869 --> 00:27:35,953
I get that way when I see a gun
pressed to my wife's temple.

374
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:37,699
Ours is a risky business.

375
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:39,333
Armed rebels take us hostage,

376
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:41,374
then let us go out of
the kindness of their hearts?

377
00:27:41,461 --> 00:27:43,370
You didn't think
I'd see through that?

378
00:27:43,463 --> 00:27:44,661
You were graced by luck.

379
00:27:44,756 --> 00:27:47,128
You expect me to believe
a man on the verge

380
00:27:47,217 --> 00:27:49,755
of bartering for his freedom
decided to hang himself?

381
00:27:49,844 --> 00:27:52,964
Parez had a price on his head.
He knew his days were numbered.

382
00:27:53,056 --> 00:27:55,973
What part of this doesn't have
a rational explanation?

383
00:27:56,059 --> 00:28:00,270
You ever put my wife's life in
danger again, I will kill you.

384
00:28:01,773 --> 00:28:04,228
Then perhaps
you finally understand

385
00:28:04,317 --> 00:28:06,559
the moral compromises you make

386
00:28:06,653 --> 00:28:09,856
when someone you love
is in danger.

387
00:28:54,951 --> 00:28:56,232
Get in the car.

388
00:28:56,327 --> 00:28:58,035
Please.

389
00:29:07,589 --> 00:29:10,839
I've jammed the feed of the TV
cameras, so let us speak freely.

390
00:29:10,925 --> 00:29:12,468
You know who I am?

391
00:29:12,552 --> 00:29:14,379
Yes.

392
00:29:14,471 --> 00:29:15,716
I understand your investigation

393
00:29:15,805 --> 00:29:18,640
into the Lazarey murder
has hit a dead end.

394
00:29:18,725 --> 00:29:19,804
What a pity.

395
00:29:19,893 --> 00:29:20,924
How do you know?

396
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:23,142
I know because I framed
Javier Parez,

397
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:26,100
assuming he'd be extradited
to the United States.

398
00:29:26,191 --> 00:29:29,061
Once in custody, he'd be forced
to confess what he knows.

399
00:29:29,152 --> 00:29:32,153
Namely the identity
of Andrian Lazarey's murderer.

400
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:34,943
This is the second time
I've had a gun put to my head.

401
00:29:35,033 --> 00:29:36,824
I don't particularly like it.

402
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:39,116
I assume if you wanted me dead,
I would be,

403
00:29:39,204 --> 00:29:42,288
so if you have something
to tell me, do it.

404
00:29:49,714 --> 00:29:51,339
A wedding present.

405
00:29:51,424 --> 00:29:52,705
A touch informal, I know,

406
00:29:52,801 --> 00:29:56,051
but everything else
on your registry was taken.

407
00:29:56,554 --> 00:29:58,346
Open it.

408
00:30:06,481 --> 00:30:08,059
Where did you get these?

409
00:30:08,149 --> 00:30:09,478
Where is not important.

410
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:12,105
What is important is who.

411
00:30:12,195 --> 00:30:13,570
Her name is Julia Thorne.

412
00:30:13,655 --> 00:30:15,612
Merely an alias.

413
00:30:15,698 --> 00:30:17,691
She goes by another name.

414
00:30:17,784 --> 00:30:20,405
A name you're quite
familiar with.

415
00:30:23,248 --> 00:30:25,490
Oh, my God.

416
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:28,869
Now you should understand
why I've risked coming to you.

417
00:30:28,962 --> 00:30:30,835
I recently learned
that Sydney Bristow

418
00:30:30,922 --> 00:30:34,006
murdered a father
I never had a chance to know.

419
00:30:35,468 --> 00:30:37,710
I suspect you have reasons
for disliking her.

420
00:30:37,804 --> 00:30:41,173
Therefore, I'm confident that
you'll relay this information

421
00:30:41,266 --> 00:30:43,389
to the appropriate parties.

422
00:30:44,769 --> 00:30:47,260
By the way, I've rigged
a weight-sensitive charge

423
00:30:47,355 --> 00:30:49,514
to the underside
of this vehicle.

424
00:30:49,607 --> 00:30:52,015
Once I leave you,
I'll activate it.

425
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,355
If you get out of the car

426
00:30:53,445 --> 00:30:57,229
before 30 minutes has elapsed,
the charge will detonate.

427
00:30:58,867 --> 00:31:01,737
It has been a pleasure,
Miss Reed.

428
00:31:27,062 --> 00:31:28,010
Hello?

429
00:31:28,104 --> 00:31:29,931
- It's me.
- Dad.

430
00:31:30,023 --> 00:31:32,229
Are you alright?
You sound upset.

431
00:31:33,109 --> 00:31:35,149
Yeah.
No, I'm fine.

432
00:31:35,737 --> 00:31:37,148
Did you receive my transmission?

433
00:31:37,238 --> 00:31:40,488
Yes. Sloane gave you a key,
which he claims was sent to him

434
00:31:40,575 --> 00:31:42,402
sometime before you
woke up in Hong Kong.

435
00:31:42,494 --> 00:31:43,869
His claim was pretty convincing.

436
00:31:43,953 --> 00:31:45,448
It was written
in my handwriting.

437
00:31:45,538 --> 00:31:46,914
The ciphertext as well?

438
00:31:46,998 --> 00:31:48,955
Yes.
Why?

439
00:31:49,042 --> 00:31:51,284
Remember during the time
you were missing,

440
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:53,169
I contacted your mother?

441
00:31:53,254 --> 00:31:57,299
That ciphertext was encoded
using a method she devised.

442
00:31:58,009 --> 00:31:59,801
Does this mean I was
in contact with Mom

443
00:31:59,886 --> 00:32:01,428
during the two years I was gone?

444
00:32:01,513 --> 00:32:03,173
If that's true,
she failed to mention it

445
00:32:03,264 --> 00:32:04,593
during our last communication.

446
00:32:04,682 --> 00:32:06,011
Can you break the code?

447
00:32:06,101 --> 00:32:08,342
Yes, I learned the code
from your mother.

448
00:32:08,436 --> 00:32:09,681
It's an address in Rome.

449
00:32:09,771 --> 00:32:14,480
1124 Piazza Barberini,
the penthouse apartment.

450
00:32:14,567 --> 00:32:17,023
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No.

451
00:32:17,112 --> 00:32:19,899
I had a local contact
pull up the property record.

452
00:32:19,989 --> 00:32:22,315
The apartment was purchased
a year ago.

453
00:32:22,409 --> 00:32:24,816
The buyer chose
to remain anonymous.

454
00:32:24,911 --> 00:32:26,738
Get some rest.

455
00:32:27,288 --> 00:32:31,156
When you get back, you and I
will go to Rome together.

456
00:32:31,251 --> 00:32:32,959
Okay.

457
00:32:44,764 --> 00:32:45,843
Are you alright?

458
00:32:45,932 --> 00:32:47,557
Yes.

459
00:32:47,642 --> 00:32:50,014
Did he hurt you?

460
00:32:51,271 --> 00:32:52,848
No.

461
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,392
I am so sorry.

462
00:32:57,986 --> 00:33:00,025
We'll find him.

463
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:05,616
He told me Julia Thorne
is really Sydney Bristow.

464
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:13,913
I wasn't sure if you knew.

465
00:33:14,002 --> 00:33:15,829
Now I know.

466
00:33:18,131 --> 00:33:20,420
I was under orders
not to say anything.

467
00:33:20,508 --> 00:33:21,540
- Whose orders?
- Dixon.

468
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:23,544
Dixon knows?
And Jack, Weiss, everyone?

469
00:33:23,636 --> 00:33:26,044
- That's not the point.
- It's exactly the point.

470
00:33:26,139 --> 00:33:28,511
Everyone at that office
kept secret from the NSC

471
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,182
the one thing I have desperately
been trying to learn.

472
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,681
How long have you known?

473
00:33:33,772 --> 00:33:35,563
Three weeks.

474
00:33:35,648 --> 00:33:36,597
For three weeks

475
00:33:36,691 --> 00:33:38,600
you've been trying to derail
my investigation!

476
00:33:38,693 --> 00:33:40,485
Sydney doesn't remember
any of it.

477
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:41,898
Do not defend her to me.

478
00:33:41,988 --> 00:33:43,317
I am explaining why Dixon --

479
00:33:43,406 --> 00:33:45,482
I am your wife.

480
00:33:45,909 --> 00:33:47,486
You kept Sydney's secret
from me.

481
00:33:47,577 --> 00:33:50,578
You protected Sydney over me,
something I refuse to do.

482
00:33:50,663 --> 00:33:52,786
It's not that simple.

483
00:33:52,874 --> 00:33:53,823
Do you still love her?

484
00:33:53,917 --> 00:33:55,541
That's not what this is about!

485
00:33:55,627 --> 00:33:57,999
She is not my wife!

486
00:33:58,546 --> 00:34:01,880
You can't punish her for the
fact that she and I had a past.

487
00:34:01,966 --> 00:34:04,208
If you report this to Lindsey,
he's gonna want to know

488
00:34:04,302 --> 00:34:06,176
everything she did
over those two years.

489
00:34:06,262 --> 00:34:07,211
As well he should.

490
00:34:07,305 --> 00:34:08,847
The only way
to access her memory

491
00:34:08,932 --> 00:34:10,556
is through a dangerous
invasive procedure.

492
00:34:10,642 --> 00:34:11,840
I'm aware of the procedures.

493
00:34:11,935 --> 00:34:13,678
None of which they would force
on a U.S. agent.

494
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,597
Lazarey was a Russian diplomat.

495
00:34:15,688 --> 00:34:18,393
All Lindsey has to do is form
an extradition agreement

496
00:34:18,483 --> 00:34:20,559
with the Russians, and she
will be shipped to Moscow,

497
00:34:20,652 --> 00:34:22,395
where she has no rights
as an American.

498
00:34:22,487 --> 00:34:23,815
He'll run the procedure there.

499
00:34:23,905 --> 00:34:26,313
He can't do that.
She's a CIA operative.

500
00:34:26,408 --> 00:34:28,649
Think about it.
You know better than anyone.

501
00:34:28,743 --> 00:34:31,365
Lindsey will not hesitate
to break the rules.

502
00:34:31,454 --> 00:34:34,124
If he learns about this,
Sydney --

503
00:34:38,378 --> 00:34:40,121
Oh, God, Lauren.

504
00:34:40,213 --> 00:34:42,336
You already reported her.

505
00:34:42,424 --> 00:34:44,215
You followed your orders.

506
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,258
I followed mine.

507
00:35:02,819 --> 00:35:03,768
Hello?

508
00:35:03,862 --> 00:35:05,356
Sydney, it's me.
Don't go home.

509
00:35:05,447 --> 00:35:07,570
The NSC knows everything.
Meet me at terminal one.

510
00:35:07,657 --> 00:35:10,231
I'll explain everything
once I pick you up.

511
00:35:10,869 --> 00:35:12,992
How the hell did they find out?

512
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,075
Sark told Lauren.

513
00:35:14,164 --> 00:35:16,536
I have a plane waiting
at the Dover Airfield.

514
00:35:16,624 --> 00:35:18,950
It'll take you
anywhere you want to go.

515
00:35:19,043 --> 00:35:20,419
Someplace you can disappear.

516
00:35:20,503 --> 00:35:22,496
If the NSC wants to find me,
they will.

517
00:35:22,589 --> 00:35:24,047
I was someone else
for two years.

518
00:35:24,132 --> 00:35:25,792
Someone I don't even remember.

519
00:35:25,884 --> 00:35:28,209
What am I supposed to do now?
Just spend my life in hiding?

520
00:35:28,303 --> 00:35:30,675
Between that and a lobotomy,
there isn't a choice.

521
00:35:30,764 --> 00:35:32,590
I can't keep running forever.

522
00:35:32,682 --> 00:35:35,885
I'll do everything I can
to make sure you won't have to.

523
00:35:36,895 --> 00:35:38,389
Rome.

524
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,890
I'm going to Rome.

525
00:35:50,366 --> 00:35:52,525
<i>Grazie,</i> Giancarlo.

526
00:35:56,331 --> 00:35:59,248
There's a café at the corner of
Via del Corso and Via Condotti.

527
00:35:59,334 --> 00:36:00,365
Café Ruby.

528
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,871
There's a pay phone
with a false bottom.

529
00:36:01,961 --> 00:36:04,499
You'll find money
and a new passport.

530
00:36:05,173 --> 00:36:07,296
Good thing I'm already packed.

531
00:36:07,384 --> 00:36:09,542
You should go.

532
00:36:15,475 --> 00:36:17,135
Vaughn.

533
00:36:18,144 --> 00:36:20,303
Why are you doing this?

534
00:36:22,148 --> 00:36:24,853
My life is already a disaster.

535
00:36:26,194 --> 00:36:28,317
And now yours is, too.

536
00:36:28,905 --> 00:36:31,692
What happened between us.

537
00:36:32,158 --> 00:36:33,950
Everything.

538
00:36:34,661 --> 00:36:40,035
The way it is...
isn't anyone's fault, Sydney.

539
00:36:41,918 --> 00:36:44,623
And even though
everything's changed...

540
00:36:46,965 --> 00:36:48,922
some things don't.

541
00:36:53,054 --> 00:36:55,759
I'm not gonna lose you twice.

542
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,928
Thank you.

543
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,738
Sydney didn't check in
this morning,

544
00:38:35,824 --> 00:38:38,030
and she's not answering
her cellphone.

545
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,987
Do you know where she is?

546
00:38:41,538 --> 00:38:43,577
I don't know.

547
00:38:49,129 --> 00:38:52,913
Director Dixon, I need to speak
with you in your office, please.

548
00:38:54,926 --> 00:38:56,385
Of course.

549
00:39:04,936 --> 00:39:07,142
The NSC knows that Sydney
was responsible

550
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,638
for Lazarey's murder,
don't they?

551
00:39:11,067 --> 00:39:14,483
I presume you're the one who
helped her disappear last night.

552
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,112
What else are you willing to do
to see Sydney through this?

553
00:39:21,536 --> 00:39:23,659
What did you have in mind?

554
00:39:23,747 --> 00:39:26,284
- Please sit.
- No, thank you.

555
00:39:27,417 --> 00:39:32,494
Director Dixon, you've always
been direct and fair with me,

556
00:39:32,589 --> 00:39:36,717
which is why I take no pleasure
in what I'm about to say.

557
00:39:37,343 --> 00:39:39,965
Under authority of
the National Security Council,

558
00:39:40,055 --> 00:39:42,343
Robert Lindsey has instructed me
to relieve you of duty

559
00:39:42,432 --> 00:39:45,552
as director of this task force
until he arrives.

560
00:39:45,643 --> 00:39:46,639
On what grounds?

561
00:39:46,728 --> 00:39:48,222
Obstruction of justice.

562
00:39:48,313 --> 00:39:51,349
Willingly conspiring to impede
an international investigation

563
00:39:51,441 --> 00:39:54,110
into the murder
of Andrian Lazarey.

564
00:39:54,194 --> 00:39:57,397
I have photographic evidence
Sydney Bristow was his killer.

565
00:39:58,364 --> 00:40:00,653
We've learned you've known
about this for some time.

566
00:40:00,742 --> 00:40:02,450
It is within my purview

567
00:40:02,535 --> 00:40:05,453
to compartmentalise
information, Lauren.

568
00:40:05,538 --> 00:40:08,160
If Bob Lindsey has issue
with that, he can take it up

569
00:40:08,249 --> 00:40:09,957
with the director
of Central Intelligence.

570
00:40:10,043 --> 00:40:11,323
He has.

571
00:40:11,419 --> 00:40:14,206
Feel free to call D.C.I.
yourself for confirmation,

572
00:40:14,297 --> 00:40:17,583
though I suspect your phone
will be ringing any moment.

573
00:40:17,675 --> 00:40:19,633
These premises are to be
locked down

574
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:21,795
until Lindsey arrives
with Federal agents.

575
00:40:21,888 --> 00:40:24,889
That means until such time,
nobody leaves.

576
00:40:24,974 --> 00:40:26,967
I take it you have Sydney
in custody.

577
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:30,227
Not yet,
but we know where she is.
