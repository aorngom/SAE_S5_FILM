1
00:00:01,072 --> 00:00:01,986
<i>Previously on "Alias."</i>

2
00:00:02,073 --> 00:00:05,525
The box has not been opened
since the time of Rambaldi.

3
00:00:05,618 --> 00:00:07,777
It was rumoured to contain
the strain

4
00:00:07,871 --> 00:00:11,405
of a plague-like bioweapon
capable of killing millions.

5
00:00:11,499 --> 00:00:13,077
This bioweapon.

6
00:00:13,168 --> 00:00:14,911
What do you know about it?

7
00:00:15,003 --> 00:00:19,332
Only that The Covenant
refers to it as The Passenger.

8
00:00:19,424 --> 00:00:21,132
The CIA wants me
executed next week

9
00:00:21,217 --> 00:00:22,676
because they believe
that I was working

10
00:00:22,761 --> 00:00:24,967
with Senator Reed, and I was.

11
00:00:25,055 --> 00:00:26,846
But my association
with Senator Reed

12
00:00:26,931 --> 00:00:29,968
had nothing to do with advancing
The Covenant's agenda.

13
00:00:30,685 --> 00:00:32,594
Two years ago,
Senator Reed recruited me

14
00:00:32,687 --> 00:00:35,937
to work for an organisation
inside the U.S. government.

15
00:00:36,024 --> 00:00:38,396
They refer to themselves
as The Trust.

16
00:00:38,485 --> 00:00:42,317
I need you to prove
that this group exists.

17
00:00:42,405 --> 00:00:45,821
I was serving my country, Jack.

18
00:00:45,909 --> 00:00:47,486
Not betraying it.

19
00:00:47,577 --> 00:00:51,361
In one of his sessions
with Barnett,

20
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,698
Sloane admitted having
an affair with Irina

21
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:55,618
while you were married.

22
00:00:56,753 --> 00:00:59,125
What are you saying,
Lauren is Covenant?

23
00:00:59,214 --> 00:01:00,127
I can't be sure.

24
00:01:00,215 --> 00:01:03,085
The shooter was wearing a wig.
It was dark.

25
00:01:11,142 --> 00:01:12,305
We were wrong
about The Passenger.

26
00:01:12,394 --> 00:01:13,936
It's not a weapon.
It's a person.

27
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,938
I think The Passenger
may be your mother.

28
00:02:40,565 --> 00:02:42,973
I am looking for The Passenger.

29
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,990
I have a great respect
for the followers of Rambaldi,

30
00:02:52,077 --> 00:02:55,113
and I know you to be
a truly wise man.

31
00:02:55,205 --> 00:02:57,411
But if you do not tell me
where to find The Passenger

32
00:02:57,499 --> 00:02:58,909
in five seconds,

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,040
I will kill you.

34
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,386
I cannot help you, Mr. Sark.

35
00:03:21,815 --> 00:03:23,558
How do you know my name?

36
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:45,287
Retrieve the manuscript
regarding The Passenger,

37
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,586
and I'll meet you in Rajasthan.

38
00:03:47,674 --> 00:03:48,623
Bring him with you.

39
00:03:48,717 --> 00:03:51,920
He may be useful
if the manuscript is encrypted.

40
00:03:59,436 --> 00:04:01,144
But when I mentioned
The Passenger to your mother,

41
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:03,720
she terminated her user account.

42
00:04:03,815 --> 00:04:06,851
Either she is The Passenger,
or she's protecting her.

43
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,564
What's going on?

44
00:04:09,654 --> 00:04:12,026
Your message said
it was important.

45
00:04:12,574 --> 00:04:13,487
You were right.

46
00:04:13,575 --> 00:04:14,903
About what?

47
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:17,115
Lauren's the mole.

48
00:04:17,203 --> 00:04:19,362
She works for The Covenant.

49
00:04:19,456 --> 00:04:21,614
You have proof?

50
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,035
I should have known.

51
00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:28,620
We should talk to Dixon and
figure out a way to handle this.

52
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:30,043
Oh, I know how to handle this.

53
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:31,461
You will act like nothing
has changed.

54
00:04:31,551 --> 00:04:33,793
Okay, what's plan B?
'Cause that's not gonna happen.

55
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:35,429
Given that The Covenant
is ahead of us

56
00:04:35,513 --> 00:04:37,636
in the search for The Passenger,

57
00:04:37,724 --> 00:04:39,681
tracking Lauren
might allow us to catch up.

58
00:04:39,768 --> 00:04:41,807
She cannot detect
the slightest alteration

59
00:04:41,895 --> 00:04:43,686
in your relationship.

60
00:04:43,772 --> 00:04:45,764
I'll inform Dixon,
we'll secure the agency,

61
00:04:45,857 --> 00:04:48,063
Iimiting her access
to classified documents.

62
00:04:48,151 --> 00:04:50,642
Stop. My wife betrayed me.
She betrayed all of us.

63
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:53,062
You can't expect me to
pretend that never happened.

64
00:04:53,156 --> 00:04:55,030
- I'm not sure you have a choice.
- Why is that?

65
00:04:55,116 --> 00:04:57,738
Because you're the one
that married her.

66
00:05:08,254 --> 00:05:10,461
I missed you this morning.

67
00:05:17,347 --> 00:05:19,505
I got up early
and went to the gym.

68
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:23,217
- I should have let you know.
- Oh, it's fine.

69
00:05:23,311 --> 00:05:24,936
In fact, I like it.

70
00:05:25,688 --> 00:05:29,223
Makes me feel like we've
settled back into our lives.

71
00:05:29,317 --> 00:05:30,942
Yeah.
I think we have.

72
00:05:34,322 --> 00:05:36,231
Before my dad died,

73
00:05:36,324 --> 00:05:39,444
I asked you if you would come
with me to counselling,

74
00:05:39,536 --> 00:05:41,279
and you said no.

75
00:05:42,372 --> 00:05:44,080
I still think it could help.

76
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:45,907
It's just a thought.

77
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,958
No, I'd like that.

78
00:05:51,297 --> 00:05:55,544
After 30 years, you still
live with your wife's betrayal.

79
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,045
Will he?

80
00:06:02,392 --> 00:06:03,423
Absolutely.

81
00:06:05,228 --> 00:06:06,687
An Echelon intercept
we just received

82
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:08,645
indicates The Covenant
has kidnapped someone

83
00:06:08,732 --> 00:06:11,305
they believe can help them
find The Passenger.

84
00:06:11,401 --> 00:06:14,236
A convoy is transporting him
across Western Rajasthan.

85
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,025
You and Vaughn will intercept it
and take him into custody.

86
00:06:17,115 --> 00:06:18,989
We don't have the Indian
government's cooperation,

87
00:06:19,075 --> 00:06:23,322
and the air space is restricted,
so you're going in old school.

88
00:06:38,762 --> 00:06:40,719
We've done well here.

89
00:06:42,098 --> 00:06:43,723
Quite well.

90
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:35,224
Thank you.

91
00:07:38,238 --> 00:07:40,563
We have to go.
Follow me!

92
00:07:49,165 --> 00:07:50,410
Give me your gun.

93
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,742
Give me the gun now!

94
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,215
Here!

95
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,649
Press on.
We have everything we need.

96
00:08:33,168 --> 00:08:35,207
They have The Restoration.

97
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:40,873
The Passenger is compromised.

98
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:42,296
Just breathe.

99
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,763
It's you.

100
00:08:49,601 --> 00:08:51,677
The Passenger.

101
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,177
She is your destiny.

102
00:08:55,565 --> 00:08:56,728
How is she my destiny?

103
00:08:56,816 --> 00:08:59,142
As a friend?
As an enemy?

104
00:08:59,235 --> 00:09:00,730
Tell me.
Tell me that.

105
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,979
Is The Passenger my mother?

106
00:09:03,073 --> 00:09:05,742
The Passenger...

107
00:09:05,825 --> 00:09:07,319
is...

108
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:11,496
your sister.

109
00:09:53,331 --> 00:09:55,324
In Nepal, the convoy
was transporting a man.

110
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:56,911
We tried rescuing him
from The Covenant,

111
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:58,460
but he was shot.

112
00:09:58,545 --> 00:10:02,708
Before he died, he told me
my mother was not The Passenger.

113
00:10:03,883 --> 00:10:05,923
He said my sister was.

114
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,169
Who was this man?

115
00:10:08,263 --> 00:10:10,339
A monk, a cleric,
a Rambaldi scholar.

116
00:10:10,432 --> 00:10:11,890
Dad, what difference
does it make?

117
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:13,255
Do I have a sister?

118
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:14,726
I don't know.

119
00:10:18,314 --> 00:10:20,473
Maybe that's why Mom's name
was linked to The Passenger.

120
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:24,611
Maybe because she had
another child.

121
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,651
During our marriage,
your mother had an affair.

122
00:10:29,325 --> 00:10:33,275
If, in fact, you do have
a sister, it's conceivable

123
00:10:33,371 --> 00:10:35,779
she is the product
of that indiscretion.

124
00:10:35,874 --> 00:10:38,080
I'd hoped to spare you
the name of the person

125
00:10:38,168 --> 00:10:40,919
with whom the affair took place.

126
00:10:41,004 --> 00:10:43,411
But if he is...

127
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:46,747
the father of your sister,

128
00:10:46,843 --> 00:10:48,634
that is no longer possible.

129
00:10:50,472 --> 00:10:52,180
Who is it?

130
00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:14,278
Thank God.

131
00:11:14,371 --> 00:11:15,995
You have to help me.

132
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,532
Your execution
cannot come fast enough.

133
00:11:19,626 --> 00:11:21,868
I'm innocent, Sydney.

134
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:25,046
I have not violated
my pardon agreement.

135
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:27,841
It was based on my cooperation

136
00:11:27,926 --> 00:11:29,799
with an organisation
known as The Trust.

137
00:11:29,886 --> 00:11:32,009
Senator Reed was my contact.

138
00:11:32,097 --> 00:11:35,216
If he was the mole,
I did not know.

139
00:11:35,308 --> 00:11:38,179
Ask your father.
He knows that.

140
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:39,467
If you were innocent,

141
00:11:39,562 --> 00:11:42,978
he'd find a way
to stay your execution.

142
00:11:44,484 --> 00:11:47,057
Even though you had
an affair with his wife.

143
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:53,199
You know that.

144
00:11:57,831 --> 00:12:00,369
I have 72 hours to live.

145
00:12:01,084 --> 00:12:02,662
I want you to focus on that,

146
00:12:02,752 --> 00:12:05,670
not on some affair I had
25 years ago.

147
00:12:05,755 --> 00:12:08,425
I'm not focusing on the affair.

148
00:12:09,092 --> 00:12:12,924
I'm focusing on the child
that resulted from it.

149
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,550
A sister I never knew I had.

150
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,724
It must have come
as a shock to you.

151
00:12:23,815 --> 00:12:25,642
It did to me when I found out.

152
00:12:25,734 --> 00:12:27,560
Are you telling me
you didn't know?

153
00:12:27,652 --> 00:12:31,103
No.
Not until two years ago.

154
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,948
When I was in a monastery
in Nepal

155
00:12:34,034 --> 00:12:36,607
run by followers of Rambaldi.

156
00:12:39,122 --> 00:12:40,664
Go on.

157
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,583
Sydney, the revelation
that I had a child,

158
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:46,958
it was overwhelming.

159
00:12:48,465 --> 00:12:51,964
I spent every possible moment
from that day on

160
00:12:52,052 --> 00:12:54,625
searching for my child.

161
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:56,551
The Di Regno heart.

162
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,347
And Il Dire,

163
00:12:58,433 --> 00:13:02,894
Rambaldi's machine that I
so painstakingly constructed.

164
00:13:02,979 --> 00:13:07,937
Together they gave me
an individual's DNA

165
00:13:08,026 --> 00:13:09,271
and the word "peace."

166
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,144
Which in Greek translates
into Irina.

167
00:13:13,948 --> 00:13:16,700
I did a DNA test.

168
00:13:16,785 --> 00:13:19,821
Confirmed that I was
the father of the child.

169
00:13:20,705 --> 00:13:23,825
So, Sydney, I created Omnifam.

170
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:25,956
And while I was inoculating
millions of people

171
00:13:26,044 --> 00:13:27,538
against diseases,

172
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:31,045
I was simultaneously
able to gain access

173
00:13:31,132 --> 00:13:33,041
to medical databases

174
00:13:33,134 --> 00:13:36,717
that identified people
through their DNA.

175
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:43,601
And I hoped that it would
help me find my daughter.

176
00:13:45,355 --> 00:13:47,146
I failed.

177
00:13:48,358 --> 00:13:50,267
You know she is The Passenger.

178
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,187
I know.

179
00:13:54,322 --> 00:13:55,697
I know.

180
00:13:57,325 --> 00:14:00,492
I also know
The Covenant is after her.

181
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:06,583
Sydney, I want to protect...

182
00:14:07,752 --> 00:14:09,496
...my child.

183
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:20,884
So please talk to your father.

184
00:14:22,058 --> 00:14:24,549
If he is concealing information
that would exonerate me

185
00:14:24,644 --> 00:14:27,265
because I had an affair
with Irina,

186
00:14:27,355 --> 00:14:29,846
convince him to give it to you.

187
00:14:32,068 --> 00:14:34,144
If not for my sake...

188
00:14:36,322 --> 00:14:38,481
...then for your sister's.

189
00:14:43,872 --> 00:14:46,445
Okay, here's what we found out
from Project: Black Hole.

190
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,617
"The Restoration"
refers to documents written

191
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,575
about The Passenger.

192
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:50,618
That's the bad news.

193
00:14:50,712 --> 00:14:53,748
The good news is
The Covenant can't read them.

194
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,500
- They're in code.
- Yes.

195
00:14:55,592 --> 00:14:57,880
- And we have the only code key.
- It's a stalemate.

196
00:14:57,969 --> 00:15:00,840
Not if we're smart about it.
Here's what we do.

197
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:03,552
We call a briefing,
making sure to include Lauren.

198
00:15:03,641 --> 00:15:06,477
Once she's there, you detail
the following information.

199
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:08,719
Analysis is currently
filtering through some chatter

200
00:15:08,813 --> 00:15:10,853
they picked up
referencing The Restoration.

201
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,980
They're certain that it will
only be a matter of hours

202
00:15:13,068 --> 00:15:15,605
before they can locate
these documents.

203
00:15:16,571 --> 00:15:18,314
After indicating confidence
in our ability

204
00:15:18,406 --> 00:15:20,150
to locate and recapture
The Restoration,

205
00:15:20,241 --> 00:15:22,649
we then explain
what we will do once we have it.

206
00:15:22,744 --> 00:15:25,614
Project: Black Hole is
delivering the code key today.

207
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:28,576
The minute we come into
possession of The Restoration,

208
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:31,418
Marshall will begin
the decoding process.

209
00:15:32,545 --> 00:15:36,045
In truth, Marshall will be
receiving a bogus code key.

210
00:15:36,132 --> 00:15:37,508
We should also
remind Lauren that...

211
00:15:37,592 --> 00:15:39,419
Even if we do not
recover the documents,

212
00:15:39,511 --> 00:15:40,886
we know that
without this code key,

213
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,678
The Covenant will not
be able to read it.

214
00:15:42,764 --> 00:15:44,342
After learning
a code key exists,

215
00:15:44,432 --> 00:15:47,350
it is probable
Lauren will try and copy it.

216
00:15:47,435 --> 00:15:49,262
That's where you come in.

217
00:15:51,398 --> 00:15:51,978
Me?

218
00:15:52,065 --> 00:15:55,185
You have to act
completely normal.

219
00:16:00,907 --> 00:16:02,983
Lauren.
Agent Vaughn-Reed.

220
00:16:03,076 --> 00:16:05,483
Mrs. Vaughn-Reed.
Hi.

221
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:07,571
What can I do for you?

222
00:16:07,664 --> 00:16:09,787
Project: Black Hole
does not share its toys

223
00:16:09,874 --> 00:16:11,452
as often as the NSC would like.

224
00:16:11,543 --> 00:16:13,535
Governmental turf war,
that kind of thing.

225
00:16:13,628 --> 00:16:14,743
When I told them
about the code key,

226
00:16:14,838 --> 00:16:16,629
they insisted
I detail it for them.

227
00:16:16,715 --> 00:16:18,422
Right.
Well, go ahead, have a look.

228
00:16:18,508 --> 00:16:20,548
And while you're at it,
have a gander.

229
00:16:22,053 --> 00:16:24,260
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Not on the Flinkman file.

230
00:16:24,347 --> 00:16:26,221
Just a little journal
I'm keeping for Mitch.

231
00:16:26,307 --> 00:16:28,633
Patent ideas, history
of quantum mechanics,

232
00:16:28,727 --> 00:16:31,396
brief intro to string theory,
you know, basics.

233
00:16:33,314 --> 00:16:35,106
The letters here,
what language is that?

234
00:16:35,191 --> 00:16:36,899
It's 4th-century
Neapolitan Italian.

235
00:16:36,985 --> 00:16:38,230
Which I love saying,

236
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:40,775
because it makes me
think of ice cream.

237
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,990
Neapolitan ice cream
is my favourite.

238
00:16:47,495 --> 00:16:49,203
Really?

239
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,452
Mine too.

240
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:52,952
She is good.

241
00:16:53,043 --> 00:16:54,371
I mean, if you had
to fall in love

242
00:16:54,461 --> 00:16:56,833
with someone that was evil,
I can see why it was her.

243
00:16:56,921 --> 00:16:59,839
Not that
you're in love with her.

244
00:16:59,924 --> 00:17:01,882
Whatever the attraction
was originally.

245
00:17:01,968 --> 00:17:03,297
Did she take the bait?

246
00:17:03,386 --> 00:17:05,260
I'm not sure,
but she did take my thumbprint.

247
00:17:05,346 --> 00:17:07,505
- May I?
- What are you doing?

248
00:17:08,391 --> 00:17:11,511
I am checking to see
if there's any use

249
00:17:11,603 --> 00:17:14,604
of my biometric access
within the agency.

250
00:17:29,788 --> 00:17:31,496
She's in Image Processing.

251
00:17:31,581 --> 00:17:34,037
She must be duplicating
the code key.

252
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,447
Okay, I've left
Image Processing.

253
00:18:07,534 --> 00:18:08,316
I haven't left,

254
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:09,820
because I'm here,
and she's there.

255
00:18:09,911 --> 00:18:11,654
The next step will be
to bring the code key

256
00:18:11,746 --> 00:18:13,454
to her handler
or whoever can use it

257
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,746
to read the documents
written about The Passenger.

258
00:18:15,834 --> 00:18:18,751
Alright, you will track her
and identify her contact.

259
00:18:18,837 --> 00:18:20,960
That should lead us to
the location of the documents.

260
00:18:21,047 --> 00:18:24,250
At that time, we'll spec out
a mission to recover them.

261
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:29,503
Jack has told us
The Passenger is your sister.

262
00:18:29,597 --> 00:18:31,673
Hopefully what is written
on these documents

263
00:18:31,766 --> 00:18:34,138
will give us
what we need to find her.

264
00:18:38,857 --> 00:18:42,107
Sloane confirmed
the child is his.

265
00:18:42,193 --> 00:18:43,569
I see.

266
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:44,816
I know how much this upsets you.

267
00:18:44,904 --> 00:18:46,363
I'm fine.

268
00:18:47,407 --> 00:18:48,652
Dad.

269
00:18:48,742 --> 00:18:50,450
If Sloane is gonna be executed,

270
00:18:50,535 --> 00:18:53,370
it should be for a crime
he's committed.

271
00:18:53,455 --> 00:18:55,198
What exactly are you implying?

272
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:58,374
If you have evidence
exonerating him,

273
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,369
you have to use it.

274
00:19:01,921 --> 00:19:04,412
I don't have any evidence.

275
00:19:08,803 --> 00:19:10,297
You should go.

276
00:19:20,982 --> 00:19:22,939
You know what I want?

277
00:19:23,026 --> 00:19:24,734
What?

278
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:27,107
A normal life.

279
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,081
Here we go.

280
00:19:44,964 --> 00:19:45,664
Lauren's mother?

281
00:19:45,757 --> 00:19:48,509
Olivia? She's supposed to be
in London.

282
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,472
Looks like she just
passed her something.

283
00:20:02,565 --> 00:20:03,597
Can you hear anything?

284
00:20:03,691 --> 00:20:05,850
No, we're getting interference
from that fountain.

285
00:20:05,944 --> 00:20:07,319
The Covenant needs you

286
00:20:07,404 --> 00:20:09,396
to ensure that things
will be taken care of.

287
00:20:09,489 --> 00:20:10,687
Oh, my God.

288
00:20:10,782 --> 00:20:11,980
Hang on.
I'm gonna filter it

289
00:20:12,075 --> 00:20:14,827
through the active
noise reduction.

290
00:20:14,911 --> 00:20:16,868
You could at least pretend
to mourn.

291
00:20:17,914 --> 00:20:20,535
I killed your father
to protect you.

292
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,000
The sound waves are isolated.

293
00:20:22,085 --> 00:20:23,200
I'm gonna invert them,
and that should...

294
00:20:23,294 --> 00:20:26,331
- Where are the documents?
- At home in Richmond.

295
00:20:26,423 --> 00:20:29,838
The Covenant wants the complete
translations by tomorrow.

296
00:20:29,926 --> 00:20:31,634
I'll meet you there.

297
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,048
Whatever they tell us
about The Passenger

298
00:20:33,138 --> 00:20:35,463
we should act on immediately.

299
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,112
Lauren doesn't trust me.

300
00:20:51,197 --> 00:20:52,740
Should she trust you?

301
00:20:52,824 --> 00:20:55,362
Trust is based on honesty,
and when I've had problems,

302
00:20:55,452 --> 00:20:56,365
I've talked to her about them.

303
00:20:56,453 --> 00:20:58,077
What I don't trust,
what worries me,

304
00:20:58,163 --> 00:20:59,740
is that I feel
that Michael will leave me

305
00:20:59,831 --> 00:21:01,658
once I've mourned
the death of my father.

306
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,707
If that was true,
why would I be doing this?

307
00:21:03,793 --> 00:21:04,991
If it was all fake?

308
00:21:05,086 --> 00:21:06,746
I didn't say it was fake.

309
00:21:06,838 --> 00:21:09,246
Temporary. Whatever.
If that's what it was,

310
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,128
why would I agree
to work on our problems?

311
00:21:13,803 --> 00:21:16,555
Our problem is you think
you're in love with Sydney.

312
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:18,431
How am I supposed
to respond to that?

313
00:21:18,516 --> 00:21:20,592
Honestly would be good.

314
00:21:22,353 --> 00:21:24,679
Sydney is very important to me.

315
00:21:24,773 --> 00:21:26,730
We have history, obviously.

316
00:21:28,693 --> 00:21:30,104
We're together a lot.

317
00:21:30,195 --> 00:21:32,401
We go away together a lot.

318
00:21:32,489 --> 00:21:35,525
Did the two of you ever go away?

319
00:21:36,326 --> 00:21:37,488
Never.

320
00:21:37,577 --> 00:21:39,486
Well, maybe you should.

321
00:21:40,622 --> 00:21:42,531
Do you have any trips planned?

322
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,785
Lauren's going to see
her mother in Richmond.

323
00:21:44,876 --> 00:21:46,785
Only for a day.

324
00:21:46,878 --> 00:21:48,289
It's a start.

325
00:21:52,926 --> 00:21:54,468
It worked.
He's going.

326
00:21:59,391 --> 00:22:01,513
- Hello, darling.
- Hi.

327
00:22:02,185 --> 00:22:05,020
I'm so glad you made it.

328
00:22:05,855 --> 00:22:07,018
You two young people

329
00:22:07,107 --> 00:22:09,728
are just what this drafty,
old house needs.

330
00:22:09,818 --> 00:22:12,106
Thanks, Olivia.
It's nice to be here.

331
00:22:12,195 --> 00:22:13,358
I'll run these upstairs.

332
00:22:13,446 --> 00:22:14,857
Thanks.

333
00:22:18,618 --> 00:22:20,741
His being here is unacceptable.

334
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:23,154
I told you, I had no choice.

335
00:22:23,248 --> 00:22:25,655
We're supposed to be
reconciling.

336
00:22:47,605 --> 00:22:48,981
You getting a reading?

337
00:22:49,065 --> 00:22:51,390
Tapping into the power grid now.

338
00:22:51,484 --> 00:22:54,604
Now, the E.M. sensor I designed
should lead us right to it.

339
00:22:54,696 --> 00:22:56,107
We'll let you know
as soon as we find the safe.

340
00:22:56,197 --> 00:22:57,905
Copy that.

341
00:23:01,953 --> 00:23:03,578
I was just telling Mum
how great you've been

342
00:23:03,663 --> 00:23:04,529
the past few weeks.

343
00:23:04,622 --> 00:23:06,247
Oh.

344
00:23:06,332 --> 00:23:09,084
Lauren's been incredibly strong.

345
00:23:10,378 --> 00:23:11,576
How are you?

346
00:23:11,671 --> 00:23:14,458
I'm doing surprisingly well
for a pariah.

347
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:16,838
I never liked politics.

348
00:23:16,926 --> 00:23:19,417
You never know
who your friends are.

349
00:23:19,512 --> 00:23:22,597
At least now that
I'm the wife of a traitor,

350
00:23:22,682 --> 00:23:24,474
I know the answer.

351
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,468
I had none.

352
00:23:27,896 --> 00:23:29,687
Excuse me.

353
00:23:31,858 --> 00:23:32,605
Hello?

354
00:23:32,692 --> 00:23:34,768
The safe is in the study.

355
00:23:34,861 --> 00:23:35,691
It's Weiss.

356
00:23:35,779 --> 00:23:37,237
He needs help on a brief.

357
00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:43,067
You're cold.

358
00:23:43,161 --> 00:23:45,070
While I'm inside,
I'll get you a sweater.

359
00:23:45,163 --> 00:23:46,788
Thank you.

360
00:23:46,873 --> 00:23:47,952
What have you got?

361
00:23:52,921 --> 00:23:55,459
Okay, switching back to comms.

362
00:24:21,908 --> 00:24:24,909
- I'm at the safe.
- Standing by for transmission.

363
00:24:36,005 --> 00:24:37,286
Scanning text now.

364
00:24:37,382 --> 00:24:39,421
Copy that, Boy Scout.

365
00:24:40,385 --> 00:24:42,093
Receiving data.

366
00:24:44,097 --> 00:24:46,967
- Have you decoded the documents?
- I haven't had the time.

367
00:24:47,058 --> 00:24:49,632
Most of that was supposed to be
going on while you were here.

368
00:24:49,728 --> 00:24:51,720
You do your work.
I can handle him.

369
00:24:51,813 --> 00:24:53,806
I wonder.

370
00:25:13,293 --> 00:25:15,120
One more page.

371
00:25:15,211 --> 00:25:17,749
Should be another 30 seconds.

372
00:25:23,303 --> 00:25:24,417
Whoops.

373
00:25:24,512 --> 00:25:26,172
What do you mean, "whoops"?

374
00:25:26,264 --> 00:25:27,806
Sensor picked up
a new E.M. reading.

375
00:25:27,891 --> 00:25:30,512
I think there's
somebody else in the house.

376
00:25:30,602 --> 00:25:31,800
Someone is coming.

377
00:25:31,895 --> 00:25:33,887
I'm almost done.

378
00:25:50,538 --> 00:25:52,198
Sweetheart.

379
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,784
What are you doing in here?

380
00:25:57,837 --> 00:26:00,209
I was looking
at our wedding pictures.

381
00:26:04,844 --> 00:26:07,335
I remembered your parents
kept them here.

382
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,339
Remember that day?

383
00:26:11,351 --> 00:26:13,308
I'll go get your sweater.

384
00:26:18,358 --> 00:26:20,931
That was the happiest day
of my life.

385
00:26:21,778 --> 00:26:23,605
Mine too.

386
00:26:23,697 --> 00:26:25,938
I want to be that happy again.

387
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,155
What can I do
to make that happen?

388
00:26:39,254 --> 00:26:41,959
- That's a start.
- Really?

389
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,596
I'm sure that's not
what it sounds like.

390
00:26:57,689 --> 00:26:58,851
Not that it sounds
like anything,

391
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,561
'cause, you know,
there isn't any sound.

392
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:03,026
There's probably really not...

393
00:27:03,111 --> 00:27:04,689
Turn it off.

394
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:06,155
Sorry.

395
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:10,237
Bad idea to keep it on
in the first place.

396
00:27:14,164 --> 00:27:16,037
Using the real code key,
Marshall was able

397
00:27:16,124 --> 00:27:18,330
to decipher the documents
Vaughn retrieved from Mrs. Reed.

398
00:27:18,418 --> 00:27:21,917
They detail a Rambaldi artefact
known as The Hourglass.

399
00:27:22,005 --> 00:27:24,840
It turns out The Hourglass was
only recently sold at auction

400
00:27:24,924 --> 00:27:26,716
to a man named Masa Raidon.

401
00:27:26,801 --> 00:27:29,127
The guy running <i>yakuza's</i>
U.S. shipping business?

402
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,305
Yes. Now, Raidon owns
a building in little Tokyo.

403
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,671
A <i>yakuza</i> stronghold.

404
00:27:33,767 --> 00:27:35,047
He's got a nightclub
on the ground floor.

405
00:27:35,143 --> 00:27:37,349
You might want to stop by,
have a little...

406
00:27:37,437 --> 00:27:40,936
And there's a personal
art gallery on sublevel 2.

407
00:27:41,024 --> 00:27:43,396
That's where he's holding
The Hourglass.

408
00:27:43,485 --> 00:27:44,943
But you're gonna
have to move quickly.

409
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:45,893
Why is that?

410
00:27:45,987 --> 00:27:47,647
Well, according
to Rambaldi's manuscript,

411
00:27:47,739 --> 00:27:50,574
The Hourglass will only reveal
the location of The Passenger

412
00:27:50,658 --> 00:27:52,450
to one man.

413
00:27:52,535 --> 00:27:54,279
Her father.

414
00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:58,077
And he's gonna be dead
in six hours.

415
00:27:58,166 --> 00:27:59,197
This is impossible.

416
00:27:59,292 --> 00:28:01,415
Justice has been apprised
of Sloane's value.

417
00:28:01,503 --> 00:28:03,495
They refused
to stay the execution.

418
00:28:03,588 --> 00:28:05,996
If Sloane dies,
any chance I have

419
00:28:06,091 --> 00:28:07,799
of finding my sister
dies with him.

420
00:28:07,884 --> 00:28:09,877
Has it occurred to you
that your half-sister

421
00:28:09,969 --> 00:28:11,761
might be a danger to you?

422
00:28:11,846 --> 00:28:13,673
Yes, of course.

423
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,347
But it's equally possible
that I can help her.

424
00:28:16,434 --> 00:28:18,510
She could be an innocent victim.

425
00:28:18,603 --> 00:28:21,355
With Irina Derevko and
Arvin Sloane as her parents?

426
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:23,847
I don't think so.

427
00:28:25,068 --> 00:28:28,022
I requested to look at
Senator Reed's personal effects.

428
00:28:28,113 --> 00:28:30,734
Every notebook, memo, receipt.

429
00:28:30,824 --> 00:28:33,397
I know The Trust exists.

430
00:28:34,869 --> 00:28:36,661
Dad, are you really so bitter

431
00:28:36,746 --> 00:28:39,581
that you would
sacrifice my sister

432
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:43,877
in order to get payback
for a 25-year-old affair?

433
00:28:45,505 --> 00:28:47,663
Sloane deserves to die.

434
00:28:47,757 --> 00:28:49,750
Yes, he does.

435
00:28:51,469 --> 00:28:52,845
But not for this.

436
00:28:56,766 --> 00:28:58,889
The director of legal policy
at Justice

437
00:28:58,977 --> 00:29:01,468
has operational control
over Sloane's case.

438
00:29:01,563 --> 00:29:03,970
He's coming to oversee
the execution.

439
00:29:04,065 --> 00:29:06,473
I'll turn over the information
I have on The Trust

440
00:29:06,568 --> 00:29:08,691
as soon as he arrives.

441
00:29:08,778 --> 00:29:11,400
That should exonerate Sloane.

442
00:29:14,617 --> 00:29:16,325
Thank you.

443
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,292
What exactly did you find
in the senator's effects?

444
00:29:23,376 --> 00:29:24,752
Nothing.

445
00:29:24,836 --> 00:29:27,920
I requested them,
but they haven't arrived.

446
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:31,377
Now I don't have to look.

447
00:29:41,352 --> 00:29:43,179
Looks like the west stairwell

448
00:29:43,271 --> 00:29:45,180
is your most direct access
to the sublevels.

449
00:29:45,273 --> 00:29:46,436
What about countermeasures?

450
00:29:46,524 --> 00:29:47,900
The best we can tell,
it's only the guards,

451
00:29:47,984 --> 00:29:49,775
but we haven't had a chance
to do a thorough scan.

452
00:29:49,861 --> 00:29:52,103
We're sort of working
on the fly.

453
00:29:58,411 --> 00:30:01,081
Syd, about what happened
in Richmond...

454
00:30:01,706 --> 00:30:03,366
You were doing your job.

455
00:30:07,796 --> 00:30:09,954
And she is your wife.

456
00:30:12,258 --> 00:30:14,002
Not for long.

457
00:30:22,394 --> 00:30:24,635
Jack, I want you to meet
Marlon Bell.

458
00:30:24,729 --> 00:30:26,769
He runs legal policy at Justice.

459
00:30:26,856 --> 00:30:28,101
Good to meet you.

460
00:30:28,191 --> 00:30:30,100
I was telling the director
how pleased I am

461
00:30:30,193 --> 00:30:31,356
you caught Sloane.

462
00:30:31,444 --> 00:30:34,196
Since my signature
was on the pardon agreement,

463
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,151
I was embarrassed and relieved,

464
00:30:37,242 --> 00:30:38,784
and if you don't mind
my saying so,

465
00:30:38,868 --> 00:30:42,320
Iooking forward to seeing
the son of a bitch die.

466
00:30:43,206 --> 00:30:44,486
Excuse us.

467
00:31:08,481 --> 00:31:11,103
You're not gonna help me.

468
00:31:11,192 --> 00:31:14,561
In April '75 in Saigon...

469
00:31:15,655 --> 00:31:17,648
you toasted Sydney's birth

470
00:31:17,741 --> 00:31:20,576
with a bottle of
Chambertin-Clos de Bèze.

471
00:31:24,205 --> 00:31:25,913
Your favourite.

472
00:31:27,042 --> 00:31:28,619
Now that I know
you have a daughter,

473
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:31,746
I thought I should
return the honour,

474
00:31:31,838 --> 00:31:34,080
especially considering
they share the same mother.

475
00:31:34,174 --> 00:31:36,415
Irina betrayed both of us, Jack.

476
00:31:37,552 --> 00:31:39,343
She sought me out
for information

477
00:31:39,429 --> 00:31:41,137
the same way she did you.

478
00:31:41,848 --> 00:31:43,675
She was my wife.

479
00:31:44,642 --> 00:31:47,050
She was a KGB spy

480
00:31:47,145 --> 00:31:50,062
who cared nothing
about you or me.

481
00:31:51,649 --> 00:31:53,108
I've always thought
that you understood

482
00:31:53,193 --> 00:31:56,526
your relationship with Irina
was nothing more than that,

483
00:31:56,613 --> 00:31:58,321
but now that
your schoolboy crush

484
00:31:58,406 --> 00:32:00,315
on the woman
who destroyed your life

485
00:32:00,408 --> 00:32:03,362
is preventing you
from saving mine...

486
00:32:04,371 --> 00:32:07,455
I will have to revise
that assessment.

487
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:09,624
Irina Derevko affected your life

488
00:32:09,709 --> 00:32:12,710
every bit as much
as she affected mine.

489
00:32:14,047 --> 00:32:15,422
I knew the possibility existed

490
00:32:15,507 --> 00:32:18,342
that Sydney would be
drawn into our world,

491
00:32:18,426 --> 00:32:20,300
but I often wondered

492
00:32:20,387 --> 00:32:21,964
why you were the one
who sought her out,

493
00:32:22,055 --> 00:32:24,807
why you showed such
paternal affection toward her.

494
00:32:24,891 --> 00:32:27,097
Now I know.

495
00:32:27,185 --> 00:32:30,020
You did it because
you were angry and jealous

496
00:32:30,105 --> 00:32:31,682
and wanted
to take away the one thing

497
00:32:31,773 --> 00:32:33,849
that was important
to both Irina and me.

498
00:32:33,942 --> 00:32:37,856
The symbol of what we had
and you didn't.

499
00:32:42,283 --> 00:32:44,276
You're right.

500
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:46,575
I'm not going to help you.

501
00:32:47,747 --> 00:32:50,867
Since this is
the last conversation

502
00:32:50,959 --> 00:32:52,868
we will ever have,

503
00:32:52,961 --> 00:32:55,630
I want to make this
perfectly clear.

504
00:32:58,174 --> 00:33:00,582
What you have done
to my daughter

505
00:33:00,677 --> 00:33:04,212
is nothing compared
to what I will do

506
00:33:04,305 --> 00:33:06,345
when I find yours.

507
00:33:32,876 --> 00:33:34,121
Half an hour.

508
00:33:47,807 --> 00:33:48,637
I'm on the list.

509
00:33:48,725 --> 00:33:50,848
Everyone's on the list.

510
00:33:51,352 --> 00:33:53,060
My friends are waiting
for me inside.

511
00:33:53,146 --> 00:33:55,851
Wait your turn.
Till then, stop talking to me.

512
00:33:56,566 --> 00:33:58,606
- Back in line.
- Hey, lay off the suit, man.

513
00:33:58,693 --> 00:33:59,891
Why don't you find
your way home?

514
00:33:59,986 --> 00:34:01,979
Oh, you're a big tough guy now?
Living the dream?

515
00:34:02,072 --> 00:34:04,064
You want to see
what I'm dreaming?

516
00:34:05,325 --> 00:34:07,614
Alright, take it easy.
You win.

517
00:34:26,888 --> 00:34:28,548
I pray for you.

518
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:33,885
I pray your soul can find
peace in the next life.

519
00:34:33,978 --> 00:34:36,220
That's very kind, Marcus.

520
00:34:40,193 --> 00:34:41,652
Let's go.

521
00:35:03,174 --> 00:35:05,048
I'm heading down.

522
00:35:08,388 --> 00:35:10,262
Copy that, Mountaineer.
You're all clear.

523
00:35:16,104 --> 00:35:17,812
Marshall, work your magic.

524
00:35:17,897 --> 00:35:21,017
I should have it open for you
in...right now.

525
00:35:48,553 --> 00:35:50,131
Lauren,
this is restricted access.

526
00:35:50,221 --> 00:35:52,629
I cleared it with Justice.

527
00:35:52,724 --> 00:35:56,472
I had no intention of missing
the execution of this traitor.

528
00:36:04,694 --> 00:36:07,102
Marshall, we have a problem.

529
00:36:07,197 --> 00:36:09,273
Copy that, Mountaineer.
What's the problem?

530
00:36:09,366 --> 00:36:11,358
Motion sensor.
It's on a random sweep.

531
00:36:11,451 --> 00:36:14,736
- That wasn't on the schematics.
- Must be a secondary protocol.

532
00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:16,205
I've located The Hourglass.

533
00:36:16,289 --> 00:36:18,163
Can you disarm
the sensor remotely?

534
00:36:18,249 --> 00:36:20,242
I'm trying, but there are
a lot of dummy codes.

535
00:36:20,335 --> 00:36:21,248
I have to extrapolate each one.

536
00:36:21,336 --> 00:36:22,450
I've never seen
a system like this.

537
00:36:22,545 --> 00:36:25,250
Is there a repeating prefix
in the majority of the codes?

538
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,371
86-86.

539
00:36:26,466 --> 00:36:27,877
It's an anchor-type design.

540
00:36:27,967 --> 00:36:30,803
Grab Dixon. He specced out
a similar system in Honduras.

541
00:36:30,887 --> 00:36:32,346
He'll know
what the back door is.

542
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,296
Dixon.
I can't.

543
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:36,924
He's downstairs as witness
to Mr. Sloane's execution.

544
00:36:37,018 --> 00:36:38,810
The execution is going forward?

545
00:36:38,895 --> 00:36:40,888
Yeah, at midnight.
I thought...

546
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:44,017
You know, for some reason,
it makes me incredibly sad.

547
00:36:44,109 --> 00:36:46,434
I feel like you're the only
person I can talk to.

548
00:36:46,528 --> 00:36:47,523
Marshall, kill the grid now!

549
00:36:47,612 --> 00:36:48,940
Right. Sorry.
Talk later.

550
00:36:52,659 --> 00:36:55,197
Do you have any final words?

551
00:36:55,286 --> 00:36:56,946
I do.

552
00:36:57,664 --> 00:36:59,822
For you who pay witness...

553
00:37:00,792 --> 00:37:03,413
...I can only believe
there is a common thought

554
00:37:03,503 --> 00:37:05,412
amongst you all.

555
00:37:05,505 --> 00:37:08,126
This is as it should be.

556
00:37:10,093 --> 00:37:12,465
I do not disagree.

557
00:37:17,183 --> 00:37:19,425
My only request.

558
00:37:20,186 --> 00:37:24,054
That if my daughter
is in fact found alive...

559
00:37:25,817 --> 00:37:28,522
...that she understand
my actions.

560
00:37:29,779 --> 00:37:32,946
She understand
that this day's events

561
00:37:33,033 --> 00:37:35,155
are the net result...

562
00:37:37,454 --> 00:37:39,742
...of her father's passion...

563
00:37:40,749 --> 00:37:42,706
...to find her...

564
00:37:43,752 --> 00:37:45,495
...to know her...

565
00:37:47,505 --> 00:37:49,249
...to love her.

566
00:37:55,555 --> 00:37:57,263
We can't wait any longer.
I am going in.

567
00:37:57,348 --> 00:37:58,926
Stand down, Mountaineer.
I'm almost there.

568
00:37:59,017 --> 00:38:02,386
Raidon security detail
is two dozen strong.

569
00:40:45,016 --> 00:40:46,890
Don't.

570
00:40:48,436 --> 00:40:50,559
There's nothing you can say.

571
00:40:59,781 --> 00:41:01,156
Sloane is dead.

572
00:41:01,241 --> 00:41:03,814
We can now locate The Passenger
without his interference.

573
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:05,108
Not quite.

574
00:41:05,203 --> 00:41:09,153
The code key you retrieved
from the CIA is unusable.

575
00:41:09,249 --> 00:41:12,084
I can only assume that was
deliberate on their part.

576
00:41:12,168 --> 00:41:14,244
Vaughn played you.

577
00:41:14,337 --> 00:41:16,413
He's likely to try again.

578
00:41:16,506 --> 00:41:19,293
But that will be
his last mistake.

579
00:41:53,501 --> 00:41:55,577
I'm surprised you didn't get
the reference.

580
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:58,624
Modified Kayexalate cocktail
washed with tetrodotoxin

581
00:41:58,715 --> 00:42:03,009
presented in a bottle
of Chambertin-Clos de Bèze.

582
00:42:03,595 --> 00:42:06,168
Just like we used in Saigon.

583
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,840
But understand,

584
00:42:11,936 --> 00:42:14,724
this was not done
out of compassion.

585
00:42:14,814 --> 00:42:20,319
I orchestrated this because,
and only because,

586
00:42:20,403 --> 00:42:22,610
I need you.
